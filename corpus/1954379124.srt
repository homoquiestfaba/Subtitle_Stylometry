1
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,787
Come on.

2
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:18,563
Let wild.

3
00:00:20,107 --> 00:00:22,107
Come.

4
00:00:25,446 --> 00:00:27,446
Come, come.

5
00:01:28,642 --> 00:01:33,272
Ivan Drech... roles for assignment.
- Leave them there.

6
00:01:41,722 --> 00:01:44,452
And this came for you yesterday.

7
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:55,329
Something wrong sir?
- No, I think not.

8
00:01:56,937 --> 00:02:03,467
You must be new. Do you you brought it?
- Yes sir. Then we are tonight.

9
00:02:04,745 --> 00:02:06,745
Maybe.

10
00:02:55,996 --> 00:02:58,430
...And progress is progress.

11
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:06,230
Samoylenko, Samoylenko. Come.
- Oh there is. Come.

12
00:03:10,244 --> 00:03:12,244
Need your help friend.

13
00:03:30,998 --> 00:03:32,998
Answer me one question.

14
00:03:36,203 --> 00:03:41,971
Assuming you love a woman.
You have been there for 2 or 3 years...

15
00:03:42,075 --> 00:03:48,139
...and stop worrying about it.
No doubt, how would you behave?

16
00:03:49,716 --> 00:03:53,796
Well is painful but just
say good luck girl soon.

17
00:03:53,987 --> 00:03:57,691
But what if she did not have
where to go, no friends or relatives?

18
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,816
Worse penniless.

19
00:03:59,927 --> 00:04:04,887
Well I think would see him humanely. Sure.

20
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,130
8 years ago...
- I for a bit.

21
00:04:09,369 --> 00:04:16,775
Things have been bad for a while, it is.

22
00:04:18,211 --> 00:04:21,696
I realize that I've never felt love like.

23
00:04:22,549 --> 00:04:28,088
I fell in love with a married woman.
Beginning with kisses, calls at night.

24
00:04:28,188 --> 00:04:32,090
Plans and more. I began to feel the body.

25
00:04:35,562 --> 00:04:40,237
I wore the uniform of
government and joined the service.

26
00:04:42,102 --> 00:04:45,765
We stoped choose a land
and fully with this.

27
00:04:46,606 --> 00:04:51,009
We had one trillion... and a field.

28
00:04:54,247 --> 00:04:57,137
O God, that such a disappointment.

29
00:05:05,092 --> 00:05:10,998
Maybe your friend you have 3000 acres in
position as bank from day one here.

30
00:05:11,098 --> 00:05:13,700
Here is an unbearable heat, no society.

31
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,285
Hairy poisonous spiders under every rock.

32
00:05:18,305 --> 00:05:21,625
They have sent you a
beautiful young woman...

33
00:05:21,725 --> 00:05:23,725
...as a gift.

34
00:05:25,345 --> 00:05:31,181
If God ever send me a woman
how grateful was horrible.

35
00:05:31,351 --> 00:05:33,561
For the type of condition.

36
00:05:34,554 --> 00:05:37,024
Please tell me what is the
meaning of suffering brain.

37
00:05:37,124 --> 00:05:41,862
Is a disease that comes when you
the brain becomes softer.

38
00:05:41,962 --> 00:05:44,157
Tell me she loved you?

39
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:48,493
I just ran.
- When, where?

40
00:05:48,635 --> 00:05:55,666
North. A pineapples and
mushrooms and people and ideas.

41
00:05:57,277 --> 00:05:59,912
No problem and just between us.

42
00:06:01,314 --> 00:06:03,531
I have to tell you that
your letting husband...

43
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:05,752
...is dying, there is
something about suffering.

44
00:06:05,852 --> 00:06:08,827
Oh, the kingdom does not have this.

45
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:15,793
Why is it hidden?
- Because if you come to me shows.

46
00:06:16,596 --> 00:06:21,735
First I have to find the relationship when
understand we can not go in together.

47
00:06:21,835 --> 00:06:25,575
Now show me the letter.
- Marry her dear boy.

48
00:06:25,772 --> 00:06:31,382
Her husband is dead, probably
is suffering and not know what to do.

49
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:42,262
How delightful to see Ms. Nadia.
Course I can not compare.

50
00:06:42,352 --> 00:06:46,588
Good morning sir.
Have one to sun in the window.

51
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:50,208
This place is French right?
- Yes ma'am.

52
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:58,298
This design is charming. I can??

53
00:07:05,212 --> 00:07:07,212
Good morning Miss.

54
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,970
I'm just seeing the merchandise.

55
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:20,824
Do not distant from what?
- Has a fine eye Miss.

56
00:07:21,461 --> 00:07:27,798
I'm afraid that we can not run
new designs until you cancel your account.

57
00:07:48,455 --> 00:07:51,430
I'm sure find ways to pay the bill.

58
00:08:10,844 --> 00:08:15,982
Oh the heat is unbearable.
- Yes, my mind, my mind can not imagine.

59
00:08:16,082 --> 00:08:19,352
I feel that long heat for a picnic on Monday.

60
00:08:19,452 --> 00:08:23,115
I can get more.
- I already invited other.

61
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,790
The more the merrier, so they say. Come.

62
00:08:27,761 --> 00:08:30,566
Oh police captain wanted to come.

63
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,250
List, list.

64
00:09:37,597 --> 00:09:41,055
So we do?... What should we do?

65
00:10:44,631 --> 00:10:49,091
Hello. We leave.

66
00:10:51,805 --> 00:10:54,950
No, I have to work today.
- Not today.

67
00:10:59,012 --> 00:11:01,947
Well may occur the day is reached.

68
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:30,944
Good morning Miss Fiodora.
I missed the meeting.

69
00:11:31,044 --> 00:11:33,339
If I state something right.

70
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:41,696
I checked what the money has seen caught,
what a pleasure to see her at the top.

71
00:11:43,456 --> 00:11:46,857
Forgive sir. I do later.

72
00:12:22,095 --> 00:12:25,665
This is not vinegar,
this is oil with salt.

73
00:13:38,238 --> 00:13:43,508
Vanelesky I told a few days ago,
has had a hard time with this.

74
00:13:43,877 --> 00:13:49,144
Well, this is someone who
maybe you have a little sympathy.

75
00:13:50,884 --> 00:13:54,320
This is dangerous for
companies that may color it.

76
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,140
Why so much hate your neighbors?

77
00:13:57,457 --> 00:14:01,957
No hate, just I know him well.

78
00:14:02,057 --> 00:14:09,196
Even since before I got here every
day came and gossiped about her mistress.

79
00:14:11,271 --> 00:14:14,908
I can not let you talk to
and a splendid friend.

80
00:14:15,008 --> 00:14:17,008
Once Already?

81
00:14:19,812 --> 00:14:22,277
Now it is who sleeps all day.

82
00:14:22,815 --> 00:14:27,915
Ago like you do in the great service
live here in the coccyx.

83
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:34,256
No I think must see, here and now.

84
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:48,538
Cataloguemos complaints. First, has told
the people of this town to play cards.

85
00:14:48,741 --> 00:14:54,475
Second it for drinking beer.
Third in the past people did...

86
00:14:54,581 --> 00:14:58,066
...love the wives of other men in secret.

87
00:14:59,586 --> 00:15:03,955
4th... it works.
- Fieda.

88
00:15:23,443 --> 00:15:27,777
A woman, women play a feigned hand
overwhelming.

89
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:35,053
She's all. At the same time just a lover.

90
00:15:40,193 --> 00:15:44,783
Why she is doing dessert?
- She is experiencing wanted.

91
00:15:45,164 --> 00:15:51,569
So why eat the same thing every day
? Soup with this.

92
00:15:51,738 --> 00:15:54,935
Is good.
- Are like pickled.

93
00:15:56,509 --> 00:16:00,929
Is always constant soup this
time I do not want this.

94
00:16:01,714 --> 00:16:07,175
Well you can, if you're not
busy we can find after cooking.

95
00:16:07,286 --> 00:16:09,581
Said you had not had to do?

96
00:16:11,557 --> 00:16:14,022
Look for something we can do.

97
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:28,364
This soup is like liquor.

98
00:16:34,113 --> 00:16:36,323
We can crush them further.

99
00:16:36,449 --> 00:16:41,379
If we can not destroy at least
aislémoslo let him helpless.

100
00:16:41,473 --> 00:16:45,825
Send him to work hard.
- What are you saying, are you nuts?

101
00:16:45,925 --> 00:16:50,855
When Leskis multiply. The
humanity will generally isolated.

102
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:54,659
Civilization will perish.
Hear my words.

103
00:16:54,801 --> 00:17:00,241
You are a man you will not be
complete unless take your humanity.

104
00:17:00,573 --> 00:17:04,208
Your education is forcing
you. The Germans...

105
00:17:04,308 --> 00:17:07,708
...have taken advantage, if the Germans.

106
00:17:08,347 --> 00:17:13,307
Enough, enough...
Enough for now.

107
00:17:14,587 --> 00:17:16,587
Moscow does not.

108
00:18:11,744 --> 00:18:15,948
The Pitesburg girl has arrived.
- Would you do a presentation for me?

109
00:18:16,048 --> 00:18:18,048
Silly do not know.

110
00:18:19,152 --> 00:18:21,320
I have to find a cure for her type.

111
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,142
Her husband is a hard
worker and is useless...

112
00:18:25,242 --> 00:18:28,428
...give comfort being the first in months.

113
00:18:28,528 --> 00:18:31,395
More She is good beyond words.

114
00:18:55,521 --> 00:18:57,521
What?

115
00:19:23,182 --> 00:19:27,320
This, this is within
which every man, that God created.

116
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:31,396
With the whole body or that
philosophers invented.

117
00:19:31,496 --> 00:19:33,459
No, this is not invented.

118
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:36,619
Always existed. And always will.

119
00:19:37,363 --> 00:19:44,633
But humanity, the natural man for
conscience provides this reasonable.

120
00:20:02,355 --> 00:20:04,423
Good morning Mr.
- Good morning.

121
00:20:04,523 --> 00:20:06,523
Good morning.

122
00:20:59,045 --> 00:21:02,105
Yes.
- Sorry I can ask you something.

123
00:21:02,748 --> 00:21:04,748
What?

124
00:21:06,452 --> 00:21:11,042
Did you read the pamphlets where
are instructions used?

125
00:21:15,394 --> 00:21:17,394
Did you do it?

126
00:21:20,399 --> 00:21:22,609
Close the door behind you.

127
00:21:38,584 --> 00:21:40,584
New Clothes.

128
00:21:45,524 --> 00:21:48,584
I'm sure you have fun using it.

129
00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:55,499
Take it off.

130
00:22:09,715 --> 00:22:11,715
Here.

131
00:22:15,788 --> 00:22:17,788
Take it off.

132
00:24:31,457 --> 00:24:33,457
Cochino.

133
00:24:37,263 --> 00:24:39,263
Yes.

134
00:25:23,776 --> 00:25:28,366
I think you should come with
me for a couple of months.

135
00:25:28,981 --> 00:25:34,977
The study, and cut this all
the direct path. I can use you.

136
00:26:05,818 --> 00:26:07,818
Splendorous.

137
00:26:12,925 --> 00:26:16,292
We have something here.
- Bebámoslo.

138
00:26:20,065 --> 00:26:23,034
Andrech Ivan describes this view.

139
00:26:26,305 --> 00:26:30,045
Why?
Printing is better than any description.

140
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,578
You continue with the...

141
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:39,503
...extasiándote nature
meets your imagination?

142
00:26:39,561 --> 00:26:43,852
What about Romeo and Juliet? Pushed
at 19 to this.

143
00:26:46,492 --> 00:26:52,187
Crap, What about Romeo and Juliet?
Romeo makes us look like animals.

144
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,433
Why not calm everything?

145
00:27:02,408 --> 00:27:09,075
Then what?
- Well certainly will...

146
00:27:09,248 --> 00:27:13,073
The best thing this is.
And you say yes but...

147
00:27:13,078 --> 00:27:17,073
...it is ugly a chewable
digestive and stomach.

148
00:27:17,423 --> 00:27:19,423
Why do you say this?

149
00:27:33,872 --> 00:27:36,636
In a minute mom.

150
00:27:41,213 --> 00:27:43,213
Wait.

151
00:28:16,315 --> 00:28:19,630
Oh look.
Do you think that land is good?

152
00:28:25,057 --> 00:28:31,257
Go. I'm willing to do that,
they remain for centuries well.

153
00:28:32,831 --> 00:28:37,598
Two centuries,
we expected, maybe a vineyard...

154
00:28:39,071 --> 00:28:43,440
With this.
- No, dear, I must tell you something.

155
00:28:49,148 --> 00:28:53,552
Not because it's terribly important here.
- What have they done?

156
00:28:53,652 --> 00:28:55,652
Come tell me...

157
00:29:11,837 --> 00:29:17,298
Very cool, I will say that this is good.

158
00:29:21,413 --> 00:29:23,949
Trained with the man, go to another.

159
00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:28,520
Glorious, things the good Lord has
provided us with such an advantage.

160
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:36,117
Only days to do its damage.
- Oh yeah. Someone pay.

161
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,628
How's that?
- The Book.

162
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:50,664
Good is an idea different
from where it comes.

163
00:29:52,077 --> 00:29:54,910
But has guts, even as did.

164
00:29:59,918 --> 00:30:01,918
Apes.

165
00:30:33,418 --> 00:30:38,355
So it seems that this will be
before you miss. As we speak.

166
00:30:39,725 --> 00:30:44,958
How want to understand?
Do this at your party?

167
00:30:46,164 --> 00:30:48,969
It was a mistake, leave me alone.

168
00:30:50,636 --> 00:30:52,636
Well defined night.

169
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,530
Wait till you're in a better mood.

170
00:30:57,976 --> 00:31:03,671
But I assure you I'm a gentleman.
I do not allow anyone to hesitate.

171
00:31:07,352 --> 00:31:09,352
Seriously.

172
00:31:19,298 --> 00:31:22,062
The picnic ended, great success.

173
00:31:22,701 --> 00:31:30,699
Yes Try to show that this will be paying
the 300 or do not know exactly how...

174
00:31:36,248 --> 00:31:42,949
Well I have 300 for you.
Now you can set the account.

175
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,761
Superb picnic.

176
00:31:59,404 --> 00:32:05,274
But I prefer the good winter.
Is vibrant and comes with frozen powder.

177
00:32:06,945 --> 00:32:08,945
I'm testing.

178
00:32:18,223 --> 00:32:21,963
Am passionate with nature
do not regret this.

179
00:32:22,728 --> 00:32:25,023
I envy you.
- Well I do not.

180
00:32:26,298 --> 00:32:30,402
Do not understand how anyone can
be interested in any...

181
00:32:30,502 --> 00:32:33,906
...that may be interested in Miss
when people are suffering.

182
00:32:34,006 --> 00:32:37,669
Well not Miss but... The talk.

183
00:32:54,893 --> 00:32:56,893
Go.

184
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,675
I want to get the wine to the lady.

185
00:33:20,719 --> 00:33:22,719
'Re Heavy behave.

186
00:34:07,566 --> 00:34:10,091
Lee this interests you.

187
00:34:46,905 --> 00:34:49,965
Why did not you tell me he was dead?

188
00:34:56,214 --> 00:34:58,375
Lord. Lord.

189
00:35:03,388 --> 00:35:05,754
Who is who?
- It's me sir.

190
00:35:07,692 --> 00:35:11,177
Save me please.
- Wait I'll open the door.

191
00:35:25,076 --> 00:35:29,514
Excuse me. But I could not stay like
with her, I felt myself like a dog.

192
00:35:29,614 --> 00:35:33,085
My God, my God, I was falling asleep then I
...

193
00:35:33,185 --> 00:35:37,889
're My best friend, my only friend,
I leave here, give me the money.

194
00:35:37,989 --> 00:35:40,125
As expected Oh...
- With 200 I think I do.

195
00:35:40,225 --> 00:35:45,390
Oh I had to lend...
- Yes, préstelo, préstelo.

196
00:35:46,131 --> 00:35:48,131
Thank you.

197
00:35:49,834 --> 00:35:53,149
I'll tell you, I'll wait for some wine.

198
00:35:54,573 --> 00:35:56,573
I do not...

199
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:04,911
What about Fladerosa?
- I'll send the money.

200
00:36:06,351 --> 00:36:08,351
Then things go.

201
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:14,257
For Health.

202
00:36:17,729 --> 00:36:21,331
You really are a wonderful, wonderful man.

203
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:25,729
Yeah, well, you have to
compensate. Both are well.

204
00:36:26,538 --> 00:36:29,941
Friends outstanding if you saw like wolves.

205
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:37,277
Yes, it is... is very talented. And I'm
the most useless, stupid and poor man.

206
00:36:39,084 --> 00:36:44,489
But I begin to see my fault and I
should swear be a different man.

207
00:36:44,589 --> 00:36:47,649
Nadia, actually I have to go to bed.

208
00:36:53,832 --> 00:36:57,598
Yeah right, I'm sorry. I'm leaving.

209
00:37:09,114 --> 00:37:11,114
Thank you sir.

210
00:37:20,892 --> 00:37:22,892
Mr.
- If.

211
00:37:24,195 --> 00:37:26,195
I can stay tonight?

212
00:38:03,635 --> 00:38:05,635
Please wait.

213
00:38:09,908 --> 00:38:11,908
Came to see her.

214
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,378
Dear, I am deeply moved.

215
00:38:26,758 --> 00:38:31,263
Oh dear when the doctor told me
your husband was dead.

216
00:38:32,897 --> 00:38:37,197
But tell me dear, tell me. Is it true?

217
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,670
Yes, it's true.

218
00:38:41,473 --> 00:38:47,407
It's awful, just awful dear.

219
00:38:47,507 --> 00:38:55,479
But now you are free and God and man
can bless your union with Ivan André.

220
00:38:58,189 --> 00:39:02,014
O I can not describe my relief.
It's exciting.

221
00:39:03,094 --> 00:39:07,684
Honey, I can not wait,
Now when you think you'll marry?

222
00:39:07,832 --> 00:39:11,100
I have not thought of.
I give you my word not.

223
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,737
But that's impossible.

224
00:39:12,837 --> 00:39:16,577
Why should I care?
Continue living as we did.

225
00:39:16,668 --> 00:39:19,911
What are you saying, ported
heaven, what are you saying?

226
00:39:20,011 --> 00:39:26,849
You must settle.
- Settle? What do you mean?

227
00:39:28,053 --> 00:39:32,558
I have not yet gone. And you
tell me I have to settle.

228
00:39:39,397 --> 00:39:44,357
Farewell my dear, forgive me
if I have given problems.

229
00:39:50,575 --> 00:39:56,514
It is my duty to tell you that from
this day onwards all over between us.

230
00:39:56,614 --> 00:39:59,589
And my door must be closed for you.

231
00:40:07,592 --> 00:40:15,592
My dear girl. I'll tell you without
hesitation that it is true.

232
00:40:17,102 --> 00:40:22,199
Remember that all
ladies here I was the only one you got?

233
00:40:23,942 --> 00:40:30,415
You sanctified me from day one. But I'm
not hard to treat you like everyone else.

234
00:40:30,515 --> 00:40:34,451
But...
- You are a terrible sinner.

235
00:40:34,652 --> 00:40:38,590
Broke the vow that
did your husband at the altar.

236
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:43,423
You seduced a fine young man.

237
00:40:44,062 --> 00:40:47,268
I have fear that a light from heaven destroy
my house when you're sitting with us.

238
00:40:47,368 --> 00:40:50,513
But...
- No, do not talk, do not talk.

239
00:40:51,703 --> 00:40:59,703
And your house is horrible, just horrible.
These separated by a few hours and flies...

240
00:41:02,147 --> 00:41:06,312
Ivan André had to tell you
that no one touches it.

241
00:41:06,851 --> 00:41:12,690
Every morning wake up before it's too late
and I wash my face with cold water.

242
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:16,870
But Nicole and Alexandre
not appear to be sleepy.

243
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,388
That makes no sense.
- God marks great sinners.

244
00:41:21,633 --> 00:41:26,570
And you've been marked. Just think.

245
00:41:30,408 --> 00:41:33,468
And your costume has always been so.

246
00:41:43,688 --> 00:41:48,591
But look what happened. I'm unhappy.

247
00:41:48,793 --> 00:41:52,330
Yes, you are unhappy. And there is a
terrible time for you in the future.

248
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:54,728
A lonely old age that is.

249
00:41:54,999 --> 00:42:01,370
And then the red of the trial,
marry, marry you and your judgment.

250
00:42:03,308 --> 00:42:05,810
I go. Ivan André maybe stay but I will go.

251
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:12,179
Go where?... How is that possibly
live there? - A Moscow.

252
00:42:12,283 --> 00:42:15,286
Translations or I will live in the library.

253
00:42:15,386 --> 00:42:22,883
Dear calm down.
Must have money for a library.

254
00:42:26,364 --> 00:42:31,996
Think
and get over it and come to me first day.

255
00:42:32,337 --> 00:42:40,337
Dimitri's Day, will be well pleased.
But I will have a word with Ivan André.

256
00:43:34,165 --> 00:43:38,465
Did I say something?
- No.

257
00:43:49,714 --> 00:43:55,414
Wanted a drink.
I have to send it later, good night.

258
00:44:00,491 --> 00:44:04,229
There was a rumor at the picnic
that someone wrote.

259
00:44:04,329 --> 00:44:07,355
Forgive me, I'm sick.

260
00:44:56,581 --> 00:45:01,143
That's, that's...

261
00:45:04,389 --> 00:45:06,389
Okay.

262
00:45:21,572 --> 00:45:26,842
Do not worry is usual fever.
- I do not think I have the money.

263
00:45:27,345 --> 00:45:31,406
Oh no, excuse me, not to despair
be patient.

264
00:45:34,118 --> 00:45:39,152
How I can see a Dr. without money?
- Look I have since 7000 and I am indebted.

265
00:45:39,252 --> 00:45:43,247
For all the heavens have to find it.
- I'll try.

266
00:45:44,796 --> 00:45:50,134
It is believed that for Saturday. If no
escape for Saturday, all will be useless.

267
00:45:50,234 --> 00:45:58,234
Nothing.
- A cream of this.

268
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,880
Saturday.

269
00:46:22,366 --> 00:46:28,532
Need hundreds... for my patients...

270
00:46:33,711 --> 00:46:37,812
Your little beast only destroyed
the weak and looked at that.

271
00:46:37,912 --> 00:46:43,548
Only those with defects
do not fit naturally to reach posterity.

272
00:46:45,056 --> 00:46:53,056
What you must understand is that just
as most perfect discoveries survive.

273
00:46:55,099 --> 00:47:01,698
Yes I see. Let me Rs.100.

274
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:14,110
Know the mole, the mole has an
extraordinarily strong mouth.

275
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,855
Know the mole, the mole has an
extraordinarily strong mouth.

276
00:47:17,955 --> 00:47:24,827
One reason for this is that when 2 moles
known underground.

277
00:47:24,996 --> 00:47:32,986
They fight, it's all right, have a platform and
they enter into a fierce struggle for survival.

278
00:47:35,873 --> 00:47:40,105
They fight until the weaker fall.

279
00:47:43,848 --> 00:47:49,118
100 rupees on one condition.
They do not ask to borrow Laevsky.

280
00:47:50,454 --> 00:47:55,092
No man has the right to tell me how
it is that I spend my own money.

281
00:47:55,192 --> 00:48:01,188
Course, to show the money
Andre sense as wings.

282
00:48:03,301 --> 00:48:06,103
Tell me honestly.
What is it you're looking for?

283
00:48:06,203 --> 00:48:10,180
Well he wants to go to
Pittsburgh on Saturday.

284
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,280
Does she go with him?

285
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:16,314
No, he arranged the meeting in Pittsburg
send the money and then leave.

286
00:48:16,414 --> 00:48:20,852
Can not you see the simple things?
He?? wants to leave.

287
00:48:20,952 --> 00:48:24,513
No, no, all of that is guesswork.

288
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:28,424
He is so unhappy.

289
00:48:31,295 --> 00:48:33,295
You can have the money.

290
00:48:36,233 --> 00:48:41,762
You have to take a promise by
his honor that the ship in a week.

291
00:48:42,807 --> 00:48:45,187
Why your honor?
- Your honor.

292
00:48:45,776 --> 00:48:47,776
Did you hear that word?

293
00:48:53,618 --> 00:48:57,452
Take on all heavens,
you're too old for that.

294
00:49:03,194 --> 00:49:06,631
You let her condition.
If the lady takes him...

295
00:49:06,731 --> 00:49:11,327
I can give my word...
go to his office and beat you.

296
00:49:11,535 --> 00:49:16,295
Y break all my dealings with you.
My honor is worth more.

297
00:49:56,147 --> 00:49:57,325
Is a good man?

298
00:49:57,425 --> 00:50:01,570
Not a good man, has to be
constantly monitoring.

299
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:05,523
Good men still in sight but only
fall if someone if someone has a weak...

300
00:50:05,623 --> 00:50:09,460
...to imagine themselves in the same state.
- A liar can not be a bishop.

301
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:13,640
Why not?
A Bishop is a man, just like you and me.

302
00:50:18,803 --> 00:50:20,438
Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

303
00:50:20,538 --> 00:50:24,108
Good afternoon gentlemen.
- Good afternoon.

304
00:50:31,682 --> 00:50:33,682
Have Lighter?

305
00:50:53,337 --> 00:50:56,738
Persero Soroco told me there tomorrow.

306
00:50:56,874 --> 00:51:01,106
Soroco or rises, the wind is blowing
on the wind.

307
00:51:01,278 --> 00:51:03,648
Provided may be a short trial with.

308
00:51:03,748 --> 00:51:05,748
And its meaning is...

309
00:51:43,587 --> 00:51:49,355
But if you, like me
go in my studio, can you?

310
00:52:28,766 --> 00:52:30,766
Do not.

311
00:52:33,437 --> 00:52:35,437
Do not go.

312
00:52:47,184 --> 00:52:49,184
Lady.

313
00:52:56,794 --> 00:52:58,794
Fix your hair.

314
00:53:00,097 --> 00:53:02,097
Go.

315
00:53:11,775 --> 00:53:13,775
What do you want?

316
00:53:15,746 --> 00:53:19,656
What? Why have not you
poured water this plant?

317
00:53:20,818 --> 00:53:24,121
But...
- Is dying of thirst, Do not you see?

318
00:53:24,221 --> 00:53:28,359
But it was you that said
was going to do it yourself.

319
00:53:28,459 --> 00:53:33,219
Where's my hat? If someone does not work
how I do things.

320
00:54:37,194 --> 00:54:40,331
Katia, Dimitri
please do not run in the house.

321
00:54:40,431 --> 00:54:44,527
Okay. Can you show 21?

322
00:54:46,403 --> 00:54:50,058
In a minute, I must
attend to some business.

323
00:54:53,444 --> 00:54:57,972
Was to see that?
- No, go to 200, I guess it is today.

324
00:55:01,585 --> 00:55:03,736
I swear to God, for my happiness,
for everything in this...

325
00:55:03,836 --> 00:55:05,689
...world, I will send the
money as soon as you arrive.

326
00:55:05,789 --> 00:55:07,789
If I send myself.

327
00:55:15,933 --> 00:55:19,928
Listen Why do not you take your lovely lady
you?

328
00:55:21,739 --> 00:55:24,875
Impossible one has to stay to see things.

329
00:55:24,975 --> 00:55:29,680
I see, why not send it first?
- I could not, she is a woman.

330
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:33,944
What I would do it alone?

331
00:55:38,055 --> 00:55:42,458
I disagree with you.
'll Go with it and send fast.

332
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:47,945
Otherwise I will not give the money.
Those are my final words.

333
00:55:54,038 --> 00:55:57,201
'Il See that and service is bad.

334
00:55:59,376 --> 00:56:01,376
Come cheer.

335
00:56:02,012 --> 00:56:06,007
Ivan André
I would like to talk to you if I may.

336
00:56:07,851 --> 00:56:10,321
Sure Mrs. just hope I do not seek to arrest.

337
00:56:10,421 --> 00:56:13,822
Yes good is a serious problem, yes.

338
00:56:15,092 --> 00:56:21,297
What I have to say is that God gives us
greatest gift to give us children.

339
00:56:25,536 --> 00:56:28,272
Well with it are the
adorable girls in the village.

00:56:38,315 --> 00:56:41,852

347
00:57:00,537 --> 00:57:02,664

00:57:11,014 --> 00:57:13,915
Lady thanks. Many times.

350
00:57:16,353 --> 00:57:22,519

Can any of you gentlemen if

358
00:59:31,488 --> 00:59:33,718
Okay?

359
00:59:37,594 --> 00:59:40,119
It's nothing, it happens.

360
00:59:41,765 --> 00:59:44,060
Do not worry, it's nothing.

361
01:00:06,323 --> 01:00:09,952
Here I am.
- Oh dear.

362
01:00:12,996 --> 01:00:15,801
Unimaginable things happen to me.

363
01:00:17,167 --> 01:00:21,160
He sat alone and suddenly.
You know all this...

364
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:25,425
...terrible disease and
is a pain not terminable.

365
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:29,838
Silly thoughts.

366
01:00:32,349 --> 01:00:36,080
Is the time of the nerves. No nonsense.

367
01:00:50,934 --> 01:00:54,838
Captain Goodnight.
Are we the youth will join Dimitri?

368
01:00:54,938 --> 01:00:57,975

Thanks.

370
01:01:02,913 --> 01:01:05,313
To find love I'll play.

371
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:21,520
When once the fluorescence in
the water that's because...

372
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:30,160
I want to go to Madagascar.

Katia see.

374
01:01:39,015 --> 01:01:41,395
We have to follow sometimes.

375
01:01:42,386 --> 01:01:45,878
This time wait will be waiting.

376
01:01:46,656 --> 01:01:48,656
See you guys.

377
01:01:51,461 --> 01:01:58,697

- Nothing, we're still investigating.

378
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:03,985
Would be nice if we saw in the funeral.

379
01:02:07,911 --> 01:02:11,612
But...
- Good evening.

380
01:02:11,712 --> 01:02:16,118
Do not need to have an explanation.
Many boys.

381
01:02:16,787 --> 01:02:21,121
Some with this bit. That is so.

382
01:02:22,692 --> 01:02:24,692
And man is furious...

383
01:02:27,631 --> 01:02:33,751
You'll go far in the game with me. And now
're playing with the rich kid.

384
01:02:35,705 --> 01:02:41,735
But me, I'm a gentleman. And
claim to be treated as a gentleman.

385
01:02:43,914 --> 01:02:50,149
I am miserable.
- I.

386
01:02:53,223 --> 01:03:01,223
For what I've done, I repeat not Ms. If
'll see tonight scandal.

387
01:03:02,332 --> 01:03:09,138

389
01:03:11,573 --> 01:03:17,070
Today and tomorrow. After tomorrow

01:03:18,381 --> 01:03:21,781
E go wherever you want. With the choice.

391
01:03:22,352 --> 01:03:26,448
You're right, I'm a horrible woman so.

392
01:03:26,990 --> 01:03:32,622
But let me go, let me see.

393
01:03:49,579 --> 01:03:51,877
Where?

394
01:03:53,416 --> 01:03:55,416
Come.

395
01:04:11,868 --> 01:04:18,637
Federona Goodnight. Goodnight Federona.

396
01:04:40,664 --> 01:04:44,998
Who's there?
- Is Federona at home?

397
01:04:45,869 --> 01:04:47,869
She still is not.

398
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,800
Good morning.
- Morning.

399
01:05:25,976 --> 01:05:30,396
Is it just as they are?
- Yes indeed, they are there.

400
01:05:50,533 --> 01:05:54,571
How did you feel after yesterday?
- Very good indeed.

401
01:05:54,671 --> 01:05:56,671
It was not much.

402
01:05:58,842 --> 01:06:03,942
Until yesterday I thought earlier that
get hysterical ladies.

403
01:06:06,249 --> 01:06:08,249
That's so cute.

404
01:06:12,255 --> 01:06:17,610
Slaves had to know before it
but so what makes our civilization.

405
01:06:19,729 --> 01:06:23,867
I must admit there were reasons for it
my house to be wrong.

406
01:06:23,967 --> 01:06:28,705
Course I do not have the
absence of any interest in general.

407
01:06:28,805 --> 01:06:35,404
My position is also at least this.
- If your position is a helper.

408
01:06:36,446 --> 01:06:39,676
Well doubt that Pittsburgh was better.

Thanks mate.

410
01:06:49,526 --> 01:06:54,626
Have you heard of my proposal?
- Just talking about yourself.

411
01:06:55,265 --> 01:06:57,475
Also your friend was keen.

412
01:06:59,536 --> 01:07:03,021

413
01:07:04,174 --> 01:07:06,699

01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:33,449
Sorry, what's this?

419
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:38,873
Rehúsalo, nobody gives you the
right to chismees of my stuff.

01:07:38,973 --> 01:07:45,943
I begged you not to say anything about me,
Who owns the business and how they live?

421
01:07:49,552 --> 01:07:54,455
Yes wanna go away.
Yes I'm dead, I drink.

01:08:02,198 --> 01:08:06,102
Excuse me...
- Respect the individuality of people.

425
01:08:06,202 --> 01:08:08,872

01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:32,940
I'm praying that are facing me.
May we take this as volunteers as well.

01:08:34,964 --> 01:08:36,494
Good night.

430
01:08:36,594 --> 01:08:39,433

...government official,
I have never been a spy.

433
01:08:45,809 --> 01:08:50,213
Not let anyone insult me
Watch your language., Retract.

434
01:08:50,313 --> 01:08:54,184
I have not asked for anything, let me just
take you or letters, I will fight with you.

435
01:08:54,284 --> 01:08:55,985
I understand.

01:08:56,085 --> 01:09:00,681
André wants surprised himself with jewel

437
01:09:02,425 --> 01:09:06,329

I accept that challenge.

438
01:09:06,429 --> 01:09:08,329
What challenge? - A challenge...

439
01:09:08,429 --> 01:09:11,000

Okay, tomorrow morning I'll

441
01:09:21,811 --> 01:09:29,684

442
01:09:32,755 --> 01:09:38,591
Now please get rid of him
Alexander. I'm afraid I will bite.

443
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:43,866
Lost your... Come, let, alocaste you.

444
01:10:00,316 --> 01:10:02,784
Please...
- In my mind.

445
01:10:04,587 --> 01:10:12,587
Thoughts I had in altitude. In silence
memories and thoughts.

446
01:10:13,429 --> 01:10:15,727
Fall before my eyes.

447
01:10:15,965 --> 01:10:20,334
Swiftly and curse so vitally
frame of mind to me...

448
01:10:29,746 --> 01:10:32,078
Come with me tomorrow.
- No.

449
01:10:32,482 --> 01:10:36,222
Ven.
- No, I am not allowed, but you must go.

450
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:42,705
I think everything is fixed.
Copenasky and Volcon will follow.

451
01:10:43,559 --> 01:10:46,796
Do you come tomorrow?
- Oh no, comprising not much.

452
01:10:46,896 --> 01:10:48,438
What am I on my own?

453
01:10:48,538 --> 01:10:52,468
Oh no, I was looking for
this is very replaceable.

454
01:10:52,568 --> 01:10:55,731
Tell me please why attack me?

455
01:10:55,939 --> 01:11:01,294
I go there with the least obligation
spy and that's a bad thing.

456
01:11:01,978 --> 01:11:03,813
How it started,
what I said?

457
01:11:03,913 --> 01:11:06,850
I told him that my position is hopeless
if I have reason.

458
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:11,855
I have to decide to be while being
honest, this is the healthiest position.

459
01:11:11,955 --> 01:11:16,688
Oh I will not sleep tonight.
- Do not say that.

460
01:11:17,894 --> 01:11:20,189
Definitely come to nothing.

461
01:11:20,596 --> 01:11:22,723
How can you be so sure?

462
01:11:22,932 --> 01:11:28,882
Laevsky magnanimous find a way to end.
And it can not be anything else.

463
01:11:29,372 --> 01:11:31,499
And you sir?

464
01:11:32,909 --> 01:11:39,109
I'm on my own.
I suppose that should not fire me.

465
01:11:44,554 --> 01:11:50,550
I deserve it not rain.
- Probably. Please come with me.

466
01:12:53,256 --> 01:12:57,427
I've been looking Ivan
André. You need to come quick.

467
01:12:57,527 --> 01:13:00,519
I'm busy.
- Someone wants to talk.

468
01:13:01,531 --> 01:13:05,271
Someone who does not know,
is very important.

469
01:13:08,638 --> 01:13:13,507
How can you?
If you come, something bad will happen.

470
01:13:34,363 --> 01:13:37,093
What is that?
- Over here.

471
01:13:51,447 --> 01:13:54,541
Adentro. Do not be afraid.

472
01:14:18,074 --> 01:14:20,074
Keep.

473
01:18:20,916 --> 01:18:25,788
This place is amazing.
I have never seen anything like this.

474
01:18:25,888 --> 01:18:27,587
I take some?

475
01:18:27,687 --> 01:18:31,360
Guess with this
no need to go further with this.

476
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:33,500
This place will be fine.

477
01:18:35,931 --> 01:18:41,130
Still have not told my price.
Each side should pay me 50.

478
01:18:42,271 --> 01:18:47,796
And eventually the death of the survivor
someone has to pay me 30.

479
01:18:50,579 --> 01:18:52,579
Knights.
- Sure.

480
01:18:52,681 --> 01:18:55,841
I come like that, but last night was...

481
01:18:55,941 --> 01:19:00,106
...complaining that Nadia
was found with another.

482
01:19:00,756 --> 01:19:03,054
Do know that. So?

483
01:19:03,392 --> 01:19:07,419
His hands are shaking.
For that kind of thing.

484
01:19:07,963 --> 01:19:13,663
The fight him is to send
to fight a man who is drunk or something.

485
01:19:14,370 --> 01:19:20,832
With a bullet?
- I do not know the formalities of dueling.

486
01:19:24,046 --> 01:19:26,936
I have to say sir is confidential.

487
01:19:27,550 --> 01:19:32,822
I urge you to look carefully at
Andre Ivan is not in a normal state.

488
01:19:32,922 --> 01:19:37,342
The last night found his
wife with another gentleman.

489
01:19:39,295 --> 01:19:41,627
That disgusting.

490
01:19:46,101 --> 01:19:48,327
Knight, what are we waiting for?

491
01:19:48,427 --> 01:19:51,507
Well gentlemen, I propose
should reconsider.

492
01:19:51,607 --> 01:19:53,486
What is the formality?

493
01:19:53,586 --> 01:19:57,106
Make an end to his knights misunderstood.

494
01:19:57,206 --> 01:20:03,880
Shake hands, let
go home and drink for peace.

495
01:20:05,287 --> 01:20:07,667
I have nothing against that.

496
01:20:09,592 --> 01:20:13,289
If you feel guilt'm ready to apologize.

497
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:24,239
No need, I got up early, drove
8 miles from the city.

498
01:20:24,406 --> 01:20:30,834
For just drink for peace. The
me says that grief is out of formality.

499
01:20:33,682 --> 01:20:41,682
Oh I get it. André He wants to come
home and figure magnanimously.

500
01:20:44,527 --> 01:20:47,963
But a duel is a duel.

501
01:20:53,068 --> 01:20:55,400
I want to fight.

502
01:20:59,041 --> 01:21:01,041
I want to fight.

503
01:21:42,685 --> 01:21:46,340
Who remembers the
inscriptions by the laws?

504
01:21:46,889 --> 01:21:54,660
To get them clear, yes. Pass it, pass it
I have a duel with someone.

505
01:21:55,097 --> 01:21:58,157
Just keep your distance that is all.

506
01:23:39,735 --> 01:23:47,735
Docha, please do not be walking
like a penguin tides me.

507
01:24:50,806 --> 01:24:53,673
My friend, so good.

508
01:26:12,521 --> 01:26:15,649
Beautiful Nadia.

509
01:27:06,742 --> 01:27:08,742
You are here.

510
01:27:46,448 --> 01:27:48,448
Forward.

511
01:27:48,541 --> 01:27:53,682
The boat goes, why do not you come?
- I'm coming, wait.

512
01:28:10,839 --> 01:28:13,467
Then goodbye.

513
01:28:28,890 --> 01:28:31,358
Goodbye.

514
01:28:32,594 --> 01:28:36,530
Dr.
- Do not forget this either.

515
01:28:39,401 --> 01:28:43,605
Yeah, at the end of the Earth.
- Goodbye and think about the issue.

516
01:28:43,705 --> 01:28:46,299
If, at the end of the Earth.
