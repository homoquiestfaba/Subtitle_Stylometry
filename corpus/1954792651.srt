(Laughs)
No one's forcing you.

8
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:29,361
You can stop anytime.

9
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:30,496
So, Robert,
your latest book's

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,630
on top of the bestseller
list, huh?

11
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:33,165
Yeah, it's
creeping up there.

12
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,167
My agent's really
been pushing it.

13
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:38,537
Little Sully here could
care less about bestsellers.

14
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:40,773
Oh, maybe she doesn't read your books,
but the rest of us do.

15
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:42,174
And I thank you.

16
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,475
Seriously, those books

17
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,977
have helped Julia and I
manage our money.

18
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:46,612
You should be proud.

19
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:49,648
To Robert, America's
next financial guru.

20
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:51,216
To Robert. Pretty soon,
you're gonna have

21
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:54,119
your own TV show,
syndicated radio program.

22
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,521
No chance of that.

23
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,556
Nothing's gonna pull me
away from my family.

24
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,558
Hey, where did Sarah
run off to?

25
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:01,360
I haven't seen her since
we sang happy birthday.

26
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,528
I can't
keep track of her.

27
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,796
She's always
running around.

28
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,631
She's probably digging
in her garden.

29
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,533
Well, that's what you get for marrying a girl off the farm.

30
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,802
It's working out pretty
well for me so far.

31
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,871
Hey! Let's take
the boat out!

32
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,140
What is she doing?

33
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:16,909
I think she wants
to take the boat out.

34
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:18,343
The dock is rotten.

35
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:20,245
We're hoping to have it
fixed by next week.

36
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,714
Honey,
get off the dock!

37
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,149
You can hardly wait for
that baby brother, huh?

38
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,985
I'm more excited about
the baby than she is.

39
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,487
That's 'cause
you don't have to carry

40
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,589
the little monster around
for the next nine months.

41
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:32,424
Captain Robert Benson!

42
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,893
You! Boat! Now!

43
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,162
(Sigh) Looks like I'm
gonna have to run down there

44
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:39,098
and pull her off
that dock myself.

45
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:41,433
Captain Robert Benson!

46
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,402
I am getting
in this boat!

47
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,737
(Creaking)

48
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:55,914
(no audible dialogue)

49
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,698
Woman:
Sarah, Sarah!

50
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:30,883
Sarah, breathe!

51
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:36,922
Sarah! Sarah?

52
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:39,625
Sarah? Sarah?

53
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,759
Please.

54
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,060
Please, Sarah.

55
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:52,337
Please? Please, God.

56
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,106
Please?

57
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,841
Breathe!

58
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,276
Sarah.

59
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:00,312
- Oh, God.
- (Coughs)

60
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,480
Okay!

61
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,149
- (Siren)
- Oh, thank God.

62
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:39,518
(Crying)

63
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,489
It's all right.

64
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,291
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,493
I'm so sorry.

66
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,051
(Beeps)

67
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:22,054
My word, the recluse!

68
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,989
Robert, what cave
did you crawl out of?

69
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:26,425
Hello, Debbie.
How's New York?

70
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,160
It's not as healthy
as Storm Lake.

71
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:29,561
Everything okay?

72
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,229
Well, I'm gonna be late
on the pages.

73
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,964
It'll take me
a couple more days.

74
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,233
Also, I want to cut
the fourth chapter.

75
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,002
I read it last night.
I think it's unnecessary.

76
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,670
I'll pass it along
to the publisher.

77
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,806
Very excited about
the book, Robert.

78
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,741
I think I can help a lot
of people with this one.

79
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:43,975
Ever the crusader.

80
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,145
Is everything okay
otherwise?

81
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,447
Meaning?

82
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:51,516
Meaning I am your
oldest friend, Robert.

83
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,151
Clean and sober, Deb.

84
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,687
I'll have the new draft
in a couple of days.

85
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:56,722
Love you.

86
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:57,823
Love you.

87
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,442
(Sighs)

88
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,366
You're gonna love it.
You can't even tell it's organic.

89
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,868
We loved the cookies
you made last week.

90
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,369
Oh, thanks. Maybe
I'll make 'em next week.

91
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,171
He doesn't believe
they're sugarless.

92
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,672
Well, technically,
he's right.

93
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,207
I mean, I use honey,
but it's my own honey.

94
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,876
So there's no refined sugars
in there, I promise.

95
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,544
- Awesome. Thank you.
- Thanks, guys.

96
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,712
Okay. I'm gonna
start packing up.

97
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:54,880
Thanks, Charlie.

98
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,481
I think we did
really well this week.

99
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,350
Yeah. All the gluten-free
stuff went fast.

100
00:06:58,384 --> 00:06:59,518
Either this town's
getting hip,

101
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:00,652
or it actually
tastes good.

102
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:01,686
Or maybe both.

103
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,355
Mm-mm.
This town is not hip.

104
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,524
Mommy!

105
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:06,992
Hi.

106
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,160
Are you done yet?

107
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,861
Almost. Why?

108
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,730
You know why.
My party.

109
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,032
Party?
Is it your birthday?

110
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,434
Come on!

111
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,536
Do you wanna see one
of your presents now?

112
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,070
Can I?

113
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,407
A bike!
My own bike!

114
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,509
With tassels
and everything.

115
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,211
I thought we said we'd
wait another year.

116
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,213
I know, but all
of her friends have bikes,

117
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:29,347
and I couldn't resist.

118
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:30,949
But we've talked
about this.

119
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,584
You know exactly what happens
to her blood sugar level.

120
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,786
Robert, it's her birthday.

121
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,455
Daddy,
isn't it the coolest?

122
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,423
It's the coolest.

123
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,791
Those training wheels
aren't coming off

124
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,726
till you graduate
college, though.

125
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,595
Dad, I'll be an old lady.

126
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,797
Hi, Mr. Benson.

127
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,133
Hey, Charlie.
How'd our local farmers do today?

128
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,469
I don't know about these other hicks,
but we killed it.

129
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:51,903
Yeah. We almost sold out
of all the pies,

130
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,205
and I sold all my honey.

131
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,607
That's amazing.
Do you need any help?

132
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,609
No, I've got Charlie. It's okay.
You can take her back.

133
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,578
Get her ready
for the party.

134
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:00,812
I'm sorry
about the bike.

135
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,047
I really
couldn't help it.

136
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,915
And we have to
trust her at some point.

137
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,317
(Sighs)
You're right.

138
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:06,952
Kids have bikes.

139
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,787
All right, Sully,
let's get ready for your party.

140
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,755
And don't worry.

141
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,057
I got her a helmet,
knee pads.

142
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,925
I also got her
a suit of armor.

143
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,393
Ha ha ha. Very funny.

144
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,895
Bye.

145
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,630
- Bye.
- Bye.

146
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,132
(Squealing)

147
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,336
Guys, slow down!
No running!

148
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,771
The more they run around,
the better they sleep.

149
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,473
I'm gonna be the one
that needs the sleep.

150
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,674
Well, you can't
stop them anyway,

151
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,410
so live
and let live, I say.

152
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,179
Yeah, tell that
to Robert.

153
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,447
I'm telling you, Julia,

154
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,148
he babies that girl
way more than I do.

155
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,484
He checks her blood sugar
like every five minutes

156
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,586
and doesn't even
trust the test.

157
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,255
Well, he's just scared,
that's all.

158
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:47,526
Yeah, but I don't know.
Something's different.

159
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,829
Jerry said
he stopped drinking.

160
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,197
Yeah. No, yeah, he did.

161
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,932
I don't know
what he did,

162
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:56,134
but he hasn't had a drink
in like six months.

163
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,336
Good for him.

164
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,339
Yeah. I think
it's the day, too.

165
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,341
You know, he remembers
the accident

166
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,844
and still
can't forgive himself.

167
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:06,878
That was five years ago.

168
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,547
Believe me,
I've moved on.

169
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,349
But, you know,
he's just not there yet.

170
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,686
Hey, how's
the baby search going?

171
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,054
Robert:
Sarah!

172
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:17,656
I'd get out here.

173
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,357
Someone's about to open
their presents without you.

174
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,659
We'll be there
in a minute.

175
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,063
Actually,
the agency called,

176
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,065
and they have a new birth mother they want us to meet.

177
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,534
Robert's hated
them all, right?

178
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,036
Yeah. I mean,
I haven't been too crazy

179
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,203
about
any of them either,

180
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,872
but apparently
this woman

181
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,808
is really just jumping at the chance to meet us, so...

182
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,343
Well, maybe she's the one.

183
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,712
I hope so. I really
think another baby

184
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,480
will bring
the old Robert back.

185
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,215
I remember that guy.

186
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,585
He used to dance around this
kitchen to corny old music.

187
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,354
Yeah.

188
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,856
Seems like
a million years ago.

189
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,665
Well, we pulled
that off, another year.

190
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,667
All those kids.

191
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,669
She never stopped
running around.

192
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,471
No wonder she passed out
like a log.

193
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:07,572
A happy log.

194
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,414
You seem distracted.

195
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,183
Oh, it's this deadline.

196
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,718
I have to get the book
to the publisher

197
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,119
by the end of the month.

198
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:24,122
So it's just
the book then?

199
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:27,759
Okay, Sarah,
you know it's the day.

200
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,395
It always
has this effect on me.

201
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,697
Yeah, but maybe every year gets a little easier.

202
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:33,965
That's just it.

203
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,867
I think it's actually
getting worse.

204
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:39,437
I can still picture the accident like it was yesterday.

205
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:43,108
You shouldn't--

206
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,710
I knew the dock was rotten.

207
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,246
Robert, stop beating
yourself up.

208
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,815
You know what happens.

209
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,983
I'm trying.

210
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,918
I believe you.

211
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,453
It's not just you
I'm thinking about.

212
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,155
Don't you think I know?
It's Sully.

213
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:00,558
I can't stop
worrying about her.

214
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,093
The diabetes.

215
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:05,497
Did she eat too much cake
when I wasn't looking?

216
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:09,234
Is she too active?
It's driving me insane.

217
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:12,270
Well, hopefully,
you'll like this birth mother tomorrow.

218
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,072
I think having a second
baby around here

219
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,641
will really restore
the balance.

220
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,477
I know.

221
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,614
And we've tried
everything.

222
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:25,316
You know
I can't have children.

223
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,318
You're right.

224
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,320
I think it's the day,
this book.

225
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,923
It's just
all too much stress.

226
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:38,430
Well, you know,
I know an old-fashioned remedy for stress.

227
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:39,764
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

228
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,166
Old family secret?

229
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,967
Oh, yeah, it's been
in the family for years.

230
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,769
I'm all yours, doctor.

231
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,004
- Hello, there.
- Helen, hi. Welcome.

232
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,474
Don't mind me.
I was just watering.

233
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,477
This is Bridgette.

234
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:28,246
Hello.

235
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,716
I thought houses like this
only existed in the movies.

236
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,551
Oh, thanks. Yeah, we're
really proud of it.

237
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,054
Come on in.

238
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,255
Is Robert here?

239
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:38,590
Yeah, we're expecting
both of you.

240
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:39,924
Can I get you anything?

241
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,326
Coffee for me.

242
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,531
My husband should
be down in a second.

243
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,533
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

244
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,535
You sure I can't
get you anything?

245
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:54,539
Yeah.
I just had a shake and some fries before I got here.

246
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,040
Your daughter?

247
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,510
Yeah. Sully.

248
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:01,446
She's our world.

249
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,014
- She's beautiful.
- Oh, thanks.

250
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,182
You like children?

251
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:05,550
Oh, yes.

252
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:08,853
One day, I want to have
a really big family.

253
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,588
I mean, when I'm ready.

254
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,358
Of course.

255
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:14,359
Hello, everyone.

256
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:16,795
Robert,
this is Bridgette.

257
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,464
Bridgette...

258
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,399
Bridgette Gibson.

259
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:22,433
- Hello.
- Hi.

260
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,369
Oh! Oh, look what I did!

261
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,804
It's quite all right.

262
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,972
No, no. I'll go get a broom.
I'm so stupid.

263
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:28,973
I don't want you
to cut yourself. It's fine.

264
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:29,974
I'm so sorry, sir.

265
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,075
No, please,
call me Robert.

266
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,678
Please sit down.

267
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:41,419
So, tell us
about yourself.

268
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:46,257
Um, right now I live
in Idaho Falls.

269
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,493
I was going to college,

270
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:52,764
but I ended up dropping out
because I couldn't afford it.

271
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:55,767
I was going to take out
one of those student loans,

272
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:58,303
but I really hate
being in debt.

273
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,438
Sounds like you read one
of my husband's books.

274
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,440
People who read his books
are afraid of being in debt.

275
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,075
That's not true.

276
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:06,945
My books preach fiscal responsibility,
that's all.

277
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,314
I did read one of
your books, Mr. Benson.

278
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,816
"Debt: Not Just
a Four-Letter Word?"

279
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,418
Yes, of course.

280
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,153
I'm actually
a really big fan.

281
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,821
- See? What'd I tell you?
- Very smart.

282
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,123
I'm just trying
to save up my money

283
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,926
so that I can get out of my current living situation.

284
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,696
What is your current
living situation?

285
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,799
I'm in a shelter.

286
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,535
It's okay, though.

287
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:33,338
Just okay?

288
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,672
I mean, the food
isn't that great

289
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,675
and I don't sleep that well.

290
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,111
I do worry about this
little guy, though.

291
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,346
How so?

292
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,147
I mean, it would
probably be better

293
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,450
if I could rest
a little more, you know.

294
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,051
So you say it's a boy?

295
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,287
Yeah, a boy.

296
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,389
How far along are you?

297
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,224
Six months.

298
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,593
Is it hard?

299
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,296
Well, you know, in the beginning,
there's morning sickness and...

300
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,502
I know why you
wanted to meet me.

301
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:08,339
And any parent
adopting a child would.

302
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,341
I'm the same.

303
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,344
When I got a call
from the agency

304
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,979
saying they had
found a couple,

305
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:19,150
I just wanted to be sure.

306
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,685
I love my baby,

307
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:24,522
and if I could afford
to live in a house like this

308
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:28,293
and give him a life
like you two could...

309
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,334
I know in my heart
what I'm doing is right.

310
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:47,211
So the agency will contact you both if it's a fit

311
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,680
and if Bridgette agrees.

312
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:52,116
Fingers crossed,
but it looks positive.

313
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,185
Daddy,
look what I can do.

314
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,854
Where's your helmet?

315
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,793
I'm so sorry.

316
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:04,262
I'm really over-protective
when it comes to kids.

317
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,065
No, don't be sorry,
Ms. Gibson. Sully--

318
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,633
I don't like it on my head.

319
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,735
Here, let me.

320
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,236
Let's keep that
head of yours safe

321
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:15,573
so you grow up smart
like your mom and dad.

322
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:18,943
Is she gonna be okay
in that shelter?

323
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,646
It really is
the best place for her.

324
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,947
I'm ahead of my wife
on this one.

325
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,049
What if she were
to stay with us?

326
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,417
People do that,
right?

327
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:29,253
Well, yes,
it's done all the time,

328
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:32,123
but you should take time
and think about it.

329
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,158
What do you think
about that, Bridgette?

330
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:37,428
I wasn't paying attention.

331
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:41,833
Well, if we were to decide
to go through with it,

332
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,402
would you be comfortable
living here with us?

333
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,738
We'd make it very
comfortable for you.

334
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:50,541
I wouldn't want
to bother you guys.

335
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,410
Well, why don't
you think about it?

336
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:20,371
So? Are you gonna
say anything?

337
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,606
About what?

338
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,609
You know about what.

339
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:28,079
I like her.
I liked her a lot.

340
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,548
It's just
a big decision.

341
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:39,524
Sarah, it's just we don't even
know if she's gonna like us.

342
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,125
Robert,
you're just scared.

343
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,096
Besides, what's
not to like about us?

344
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:49,200
Well, if she's read one of my books,
she can't be that bad.

345
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:54,739
I think we're
gonna be very happy.

346
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:24,102
Hi. Welcome to our home.

347
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,003
No more heavy
lifting for you.

348
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:26,904
Give me those.

349
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:27,905
Oh, I'm okay.

350
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,240
Aw, you better
listen to him.

351
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,274
He's not gonna
let you out of his sight

352
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,945
for the next three months.

353
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,114
And finally,
this is your room.

354
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,782
Hope you like it.

355
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,183
The bathroom's in there,

356
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:43,521
and extra towels,
I think, are in here.

357
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:46,791
- It's nice. It's so big.
- Thanks.

358
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:50,194
Robert and I added it on when we
thought we were having a second child.

359
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,563
I guess maybe I never
stopped believing

360
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:55,433
that this would be
a baby's room again.

361
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,902
Well, now it will be.

362
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,904
Thank you.

363
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:03,808
I can't tell you how much this
means to me and my family.

364
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,610
- Hey, you.
- Hey, Mommy.

365
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,944
Hey, you remember Sully?

366
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,447
Of course. How's
the bike riding going?

367
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,050
Okay. My dad wouldn't
take off my training wheels.

368
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,318
My daddy wouldn't
either,

369
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,887
but I'm sure
he'll come around.

370
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,155
Yeah, don't be so sure.

371
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:20,491
Is that a baby in there?

372
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:21,893
Yeah, it's
your baby brother.

373
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,561
Do you wanna feel?

374
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,732
Okay, maybe next time.

375
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,434
I don't feel him
kicking now anyways.

376
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,936
All right, well,
let's check your pump and get you some breakfast.

377
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,171
Okay.

378
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,773
Can I get you anything?

379
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,509
I could go for
a giant bowl of ice cream.

380
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:43,014
Sorry.
We don't keep a lot of sugary things in the house.

381
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,649
Because of her.
She's diabetic.

382
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,652
But I'm sure I can
find you something.

383
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,253
Oh, actually, I'm good.

384
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,655
Yeah. Just to warn you,

385
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,089
I'm one of those
organic food people.

386
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,357
What can I say?

387
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:56,961
Ooh.

388
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,030
Oh, you okay?

389
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:01,032
Yeah. I think
I need to rest.

390
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,833
Oh, okay.

391
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,936
- Hello?
- We're in the guest room.

392
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,838
Charlie helps me at the farm stand.
You'll love him.

393
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,541
Bridgette. Thank God
you're finally here.

394
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:11,876
Maybe the boss lady
will relax a little.

395
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,544
Yeah, don't count on it.

396
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,646
Did you see how many orders
of pumpkin bread we got?

397
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,148
Work, work, work.

398
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,349
If I didn't love her
so much, I'd kill her.

399
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,218
Okay, we're gonna
leave you alone.

400
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,486
Great meeting you.
You'll be seeing too much of me around here.

401
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,322
And you'll be seeing
way too much of me.

402
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,723
I like her.

403
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:27,124
All right, we're
suffocating you now.

404
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,026
Okay, bye.

405
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:50,174
Oh, Robert..

406
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,942
What a mess.

407
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:02,520
Was thinking
of having Sully

408
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:04,021
help me out at
the farm stand today.

409
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,523
Get her out of your hair
and let you write in peace.

410
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:06,590
That would be great.

411
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,126
I could use
the peace and quiet.

412
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,831
Oh, hi. Good morning.

413
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:15,466
Good morning.

414
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,835
I don't usually
sleep in this late.

415
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,804
Oh, you can sleep
as late as you want.

416
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,806
I'm sure you're really
tired from yesterday.

417
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,174
I was out like a light.

418
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,342
That bed is so comfortable.

419
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:25,810
And it's so peaceful here.

420
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,244
So what can we get you?

421
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,913
Oh, don't bother.

422
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:30,715
I don't really
eat breakfast.

423
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,049
Nothing? I can't
make you some eggs?

424
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,918
Hot cereal? Anything?

425
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:37,488
Some coffee, but
I'm not really hungry.

426
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,856
You have to eat
for the baby as well.

427
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:41,726
You better
listen to her.

428
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,194
She's bossier
than her mother.

429
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:47,598
Okay, you win.
What should I have?

430
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:50,501
Cereal. I bet cereal's
good for babies.

431
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,170
Okay, cereal it is.

432
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,139
Don't indulge her.
You'll never hear the end of it.

433
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:57,108
She'll give you more advice
than a pediatrician.

434
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:01,946
So Sully and I are
gonna go into town today.

435
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,080
I have a farm stand there.

436
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,082
Do you wanna go
into town with us?

437
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:06,250
You should come!

438
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:08,419
You could work
at the stand like me.

439
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,121
Ladies,
let the girl rest.

440
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,423
How about this?
We'll come into town later for lunch.

441
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:13,457
That's a good idea.

442
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,593
Meanwhile,
you can get settled.

443
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:16,894
Yeah, I think
that'd be better.

444
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,929
Plus, I saw you guys
have a dock out there?

445
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:21,365
I'd love to go
down there and read.

446
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,604
The dock is off-limits.

447
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:29,740
It's too dangerous.

448
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,378
All right. Well,
we should get going.

449
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,880
Charlie likes to have
help setting up.

450
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,648
Let's get
your coloring books.

451
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:38,816
Okay.

452
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,217
Stay close
to your mother.

453
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,652
Don't forget
your emergency snack.

454
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:44,121
Okay. Bye, Bridgette.

455
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,523
Bye, Sully.

456
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,324
Hey, thanks for the advice.

457
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,904
So what did
the publisher say?

458
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,239
They're fine with cutting
that chapter, Robert,

459
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,575
but they're hoping for
a late fall release.

460
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,077
I know. I'm working
as fast as I can, Deb.

461
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,180
That's not why I called you, Robert,
and you know it.

462
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:10,748
The answer is no.

463
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,349
Robert, we sell twice
as many of your books

464
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:14,151
if you do a book tour.

465
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,853
I make enough, okay?

466
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,788
And I've said it a billion times.
No more book tours.

467
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,089
Those days are over.

468
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,357
Why do you hate
your readers?

469
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,092
I love my readers.

470
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,361
I just don't have the stamina
to go on the road again,

471
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,197
especially after last time.

472
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:28,632
Oh, come on, Robert.
You're not fooling me.

473
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,101
No one partied as hard
as you did on the road.

474
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,937
Is that what that was?
Partying?

475
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,705
I believe they have
a clinical name for it.

476
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:38,175
If you recall,
I blacked out last time.

477
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,477
Fine, so lay off
the booze.

478
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:40,478
But you still
have groupies,

479
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:41,479
and they
want to see you.

480
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,380
Debbie.

481
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,382
Fine, I'm done. I will
wait for the pages.

482
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:46,684
They want a corrected
proof in a month.

483
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:48,385
Don't remind me.
Bye, Deb.

484
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,888
Bye. Love you.

485
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:53,324
(Knock on door)

486
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:55,059
Come in.

487
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:02,166
I'm so sorry
to bother you.

488
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,035
I was going to sit out
on the patio in the sun,

489
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:09,507
and I was wondering if you
have any sunblock in the house.

490
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:12,977
Sunblock? Yeah.

491
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,846
Oh, I did it. I'm
totally bothering you.

492
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:20,818
No, no, no. It's just
when I come in here,

493
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,387
I go to a different place,
that's all.

494
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:28,192
The life
of a writer. Wow.

495
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,397
It must get hard,
Robert.

496
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:35,533
Hard?

497
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:40,738
It is sometimes.

498
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:45,409
Alone all the time.

499
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:51,115
Sunblock. Follow me.

500
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,619
Well, I know she keeps
bug spray in here,

501
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:58,889
so I'm assuming
we'll find sunblock.

502
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:02,192
Honestly, I could get rid
of half this stuff

503
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,261
and I don't think
anyone would notice.

504
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,597
Well, I found a box
of Christmas lights.

505
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:09,433
Perfect. Oh, if you need
gardening gloves,

506
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,735
there's a whole bag
over here.

507
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,538
Oh, there's more stuff in here than my last apartment.

508
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,907
If you see bug spray,
it should be close by.

509
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,475
Oh, here's bug spray.

510
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,578
Okay, it should be
right by the bug spray.

511
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:23,180
I don't see it.

512
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:26,617
- Ah, sunscreen.
- Awesome.

513
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:32,556
SPF-30.
Is that enough?

514
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,992
Yeah, it'll do.

515
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:39,630
Well, if you need
anything else,

516
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:44,902
batteries, lighter fluid,
it should all be in here.

517
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,937
I'll keep that in mind.

518
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,247
- Coffee.
- Oh, you're a lifesaver.

519
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,016
Gosh, we had a pretty
good crowd this morning.

520
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,518
Yeah, best little farm
stand in Storm Lake.

521
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:04,021
Hey, Robert's bringing Bridgette into town for lunch.

522
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:07,491
So what's she like?

523
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:10,294
She's quiet. You know,
I think she's getting used to us.

524
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:12,796
And you just leave her alone
in the house with Robert?

525
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:13,931
She's six months
pregnant.

526
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,332
Some men like that.

527
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,001
How would you know?

528
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:18,535
Look, gay people live in the
same world as everyone else.

529
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,871
She's not his type.

530
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:22,439
Oh, you're right.
Men hate gorgeous women.

531
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,142
No wonder
she got knocked up.

532
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,945
Charlie! I feel sorry
for her, poor girl.

533
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,680
Look, you're doing
a beautiful thing.

534
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:32,316
And knowing Robert,
he's probably hiding in his attic

535
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,317
too afraid
to even talk to her.

536
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:35,452
(Laughs)

537
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:14,258
We should get going if you wanna do lunch in town.

538
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,495
I keep falling asleep.

539
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,863
Well, we don't
have to go.

540
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,665
I could make you
some lunch here.

541
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,068
Yeah, I think
that might be better.

542
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:28,038
I just don't know
if I'm feeling up to it.

543
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,873
I'll just text Sarah
and let her know.

544
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,278
She won't be disappointed,
will she?

545
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:37,781
Sarah? No. She never
stops working,

546
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,516
and that's the way
she likes it.

547
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,087
(Cell phone vibrates)

548
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:00,938
No--

549
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:02,940
I am. What do you think
I'm doing?

550
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:06,210
I know, but these
things take time.

551
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,645
Would you stop
freaking out?

552
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,548
Bridgette? Hi.

553
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:15,586
Hi. Charlie.

554
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,388
Sarah and Robert's friend?

555
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,658
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

556
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:22,893
I was on the phone

557
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,628
and my mind was
a million miles away.

558
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:26,463
Don't stress about it.
I'm completely forgettable.

559
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,565
You getting
your morning fix?

560
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,601
Yeah, I don't operate
without my coffee.

561
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:33,170
Same. So how's life cooped up
in the Benson mansion?

562
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:35,539
I love it.
Robert is so nice.

563
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:40,577
Listen, you should
really be careful.

564
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,447
Robert has a really
violent temper,

565
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:47,184
and the police in this town have
a 24-hour surveillance on him.

566
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:49,653
For what?

567
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:52,990
(Laughs)
I'm totally kidding.

568
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:56,026
He's like the nicest man
in the world.

569
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,194
Maybe a little reserved,

570
00:29:57,228 --> 00:29:58,929
but everyone
has their demons, right?

571
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,531
Yeah, I guess.

572
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:01,932
Can I feel?

573
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:04,768
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

574
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,804
- No, I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

575
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:08,806
It's totally fine.
It makes me uncomfortable.

576
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,340
Yeah, of course it would.

577
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:11,842
I mean, strangers coming up
to you feeling your belly?

578
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:13,143
It's weird.

579
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,779
- Miss, large latte?
- Yeah.

580
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:16,880
Charlie, leave
my customers alone.

581
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,015
Don't get on her bad side.

582
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:19,283
She'll spit in your coffee.

583
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,552
Well,
it was nice seeing you.

584
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:22,719
Yeah.

585
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:24,588
I'm sure
I'll see you around.

586
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:25,889
Can't be avoided.

587
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:39,169
So, Bridgette, you've
been here for a few days.

588
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:41,338
What do you think
of our little town?

589
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:42,573
It's like
a little dream town.

590
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,408
Everyone is so friendly.

591
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:46,210
I feel like
I could live here.

592
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:47,477
We like it.

593
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,480
I had coffee
at the little café in town,

594
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,216
and then
I went into some shops.

595
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,383
It's tourist season
right now.

596
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:54,585
People come here
for the lake.

597
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:55,986
Robert hates them,

598
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,690
but I kind of like it
when the town picks up.

599
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,258
I don't hate them.

600
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:02,826
I just don't like the big motors on the lake.

601
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,228
It's too loud.

602
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:05,662
Robert's trying to regulate

603
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,897
the size of the motor
you can have on the lake.

604
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:08,732
It's a political thing,

605
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:10,767
and if you're not on Robert's side,
you're an idiot.

606
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,169
Well, they are idiots.

607
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,537
I'm trying to help them
save their town.

608
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:15,772
See, I think I prefer
peace and quiet, too.

609
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:17,441
I had this boyfriend once

610
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,109
who had a really big
loud boat,

611
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:21,011
and every weekend, we'd go
up to this lake by us,

612
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,380
and he'd make me sit
on the front in a bikini

613
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:24,715
just to show me off.

614
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,516
I knew how to pick 'em.

615
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,590
So you ran
into Charlie today?

616
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,592
Yes, I did.

617
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:38,896
He's the best.
He's been working for me for about four years.

618
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,731
I used to sell organic
fruits and vegetables

619
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,232
out of the back
of my truck,

620
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:45,068
and Charlie was the one
that got me thinking bigger.

621
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:48,906
Sarah's about to open two new stands in nearby towns.

622
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,642
If this continues,
I may be able to retire.

623
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,210
(All laugh)

624
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,978
What would you do
if you could retire?

625
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,747
Exactly
what I'm doing now.

626
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:59,416
I'd write and make sure
this little girl

627
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,784
has everything
she needs.

628
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:02,953
Don't forget about
my new baby brother.

629
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:04,788
You're right.

630
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:07,891
Sarah can work,
and I'll stay at home with the two kids.

631
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,327
That sounds perfect.

632
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:15,465
Can I say something?

633
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,803
When I first got here,

634
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:21,905
I guess
I was a little scared,

635
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,475
'cause this is really
a big decision.

636
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,945
But you guys are so nice

637
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:31,281
and you really do have
the perfect life.

638
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:34,184
I know my baby couldn't be
in a happier place.

639
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:39,356
I can't tell you how happy
you've made us.

640
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,993
And you're gonna have a perfect life, too,
one day, I promise.

641
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:45,462
I hope it's in
a town like this

642
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:47,364
with a family like yours.

643
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:21,031
You bet.

644
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:22,599
Okay, right there?
Right there?

645
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:25,836
Yes. Okay. I'm gonna
hold you to start.

646
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:33,210
Okay, I'm gonna
let go in 1, 2, 3.

647
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,050
Okay, don't get
too close to the road!

648
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,487
Sully!

649
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,491
- (Car horn honks)
- Aah!

650
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,298
Dwayne?

651
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:58,835
So a girl's gotta
be more careful, huh?

652
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,637
What are you doing here?

653
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:04,408
Oh, you know.
I'm just checking up on my two favorite babes.

654
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:10,714
It's a nice house.

655
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:12,749
Yeah, well,
you can't be here.

656
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:16,153
I told you to wait
for me at the cabin.

657
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:20,157
Hey there, little girl.
What's your name, hmm?

658
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:21,758
Dwayne, cut it out.

659
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,027
You have to go.

660
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:27,264
Okay, okay.

661
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:29,499
Now.

662
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,902
I'll see you soon.

663
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:33,703
Go.

664
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,773
It was nice meeting you.

665
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:43,313
Do you know that man?

666
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:45,549
Sort of.

667
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:49,119
He scared me.

668
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:52,422
I know, but he's gone now.

669
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:57,227
Men like that,
you gotta be careful, Sully.

670
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,796
Most of them
just want to use you.

671
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,300
Did you see?

672
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:05,635
I rode my bike without
the training wheels.

673
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,105
I did, yeah.

674
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:14,044
But listen, if your daddy caught you,
he would not be happy.

675
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:16,213
So how about
we just make this

676
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:17,981
our little secret
for a while, okay?

677
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:19,749
But I want to show him.

678
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,486
I know,
but if he finds out you took the training wheels off,

679
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,787
he might
take your bike away.

680
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:26,790
- He will?
- Mm-hmm.

681
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:30,460
So don't tell anybody
about the training wheels

682
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:33,263
or the man that
was just here, okay?

683
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:36,833
Okay, but you can't
tell anyone either.

684
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:39,169
Cross my heart.

685
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:46,176
Coffee break
in 10 minutes?

686
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,178
Yeah. Can we
make it five?

687
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:49,913
Hey, how's Bridgette
working out?

688
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:51,248
She's really great.

689
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:53,583
She and Sully are
practically best friends.

690
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,318
What does Robert think?

691
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:57,420
Um, I don't know.

692
00:35:57,455 --> 00:36:00,590
He's been kind of a
little shut down lately.

693
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,425
What do you mean?

694
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,127
It's like he's afraid
or something.

695
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,495
Afraid of what?

696
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,030
Oh, everything.

697
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,099
Life, having fun, Sully.

698
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:11,668
He worries about her so much,
I don't know what to do.

699
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:13,603
Well, maybe he should
see a therapist.

700
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:16,006
Oh, you know Robert.
He thinks therapists are for sick people.

701
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,176
Typical.

702
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,144
I really thought bringing
Bridgette into the house

703
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,512
and adopting this baby

704
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,648
would sort of pull him
out of it you, you know?

705
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,517
But it's almost like
it's made it worse.

706
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:31,321
Even I've noticed that Robert's been a little off lately.

707
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,190
Is everything okay?

708
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,525
Yeah. I think
he's just stressed.

709
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,860
Yeah, once we have
the baby,

710
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:39,462
I feel like we'll all
find some peace.

711
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:40,530
- Is that how it works?
- Yeah, all right.

712
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,899
Go get your coffee,
smart-ass.

713
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:53,076
- Hello.
- (Gasp)

714
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:57,981
You startled me.

715
00:36:58,015 --> 00:36:59,749
I was daydreaming.

716
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,384
I do that a lot.

717
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,587
Wishing
you were on the lake?

718
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,021
Gosh, no.

719
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,359
Oh, sit.

720
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:16,333
The truth is,
I'm actually afraid to get on the water.

721
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:19,369
Afraid?

722
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:24,107
Some years ago,
Sarah had an accident.

723
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:25,775
Accident?

724
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,011
The dock broke.

725
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:30,981
She hit her head
and fell in the water.

726
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:35,585
She was
six months pregnant.

727
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,455
We lost the child.

728
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,059
You must have been
so tortured.

729
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:47,197
The worst part is,
I blame her.

730
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:52,202
I know
it was an accident.

731
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:54,938
If she just hadn't acted
so foolishly...

732
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:56,873
Yeah.

733
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:59,743
I just can't seem
to get past that.

734
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:04,481
Sometimes I think I may never
love her the way I used to.

735
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:14,991
It's funny. I've never
told anyone that before.

736
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:18,028
Well, maybe
you feel safe around me.

737
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:21,264
(Chuckles) Maybe.

738
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:29,039
Robert, are you happy?

739
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:33,643
Happy?
I'm not really sure.

740
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,245
Sometimes I am, I guess.

741
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:40,750
What about you?
Are you happy?

742
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:44,654
I think soon
I'll be very happy.

743
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:48,224
You really are
a strange girl.

744
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,126
(Chuckles)

745
00:38:58,235 --> 00:38:59,602
Hey, Charlie.

746
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:00,637
Good morning.

747
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,372
Coffee for me,
decaf for Sarah.

748
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:04,074
You got it.

749
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:05,875
How's work today?

750
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:20,857
Charlie?
Your coffees?

751
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:22,192
Oh.

752
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,575
You haven't turned the page
in five minutes.

753
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:39,476
Is everything okay?

754
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:42,645
Everything's fine.

755
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,080
Okay.

756
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,484
I was in
the pantry today

757
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:51,554
and I found an unopened
box of chocolates.

758
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:53,590
It was probably a gift
or something.

759
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:54,991
Come on, Sarah.

760
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:56,092
If Sully
were to find that,

761
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,527
you know exactly
what would happen.

762
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:58,895
Robert, what is going on?

763
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:01,598
You know the dangers
of diabetic ketoacidosis.

764
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:04,167
And Sully knows not to eat
candy unless we say it's okay.

765
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:05,502
You have to trust her.

766
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:06,603
She's six.

767
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:07,771
I cannot take this
anymore, Robert,

768
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,572
with all this worrying.

769
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:10,940
Ever since you got back
from your last book tour,

770
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:12,609
you've been completely
shut down.

771
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:13,943
It is suffocating.

772
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:16,045
I've noticed it,
Sully's noticed it.

773
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,214
Even Charlie said something
to me about it.

774
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:21,251
What is going on?

775
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:24,754
Nothing.
Nothing at all.

776
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,790
Bridgette?

777
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,559
Sully!

778
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:43,800
Were you spying on me?

779
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:44,934
What's that?

780
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:49,038
This? It's nothing.

781
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:51,140
Why do you wear that?

782
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:58,047
Look, I have
to tell you something,

783
00:41:58,082 --> 00:41:59,616
but it needs to be
our little secret.

784
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,318
Okay.

785
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,321
So some women,
when they get pregnant,

786
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:08,491
they have big bellies
and some don't.

787
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,627
I have a small belly.

788
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:15,532
Then why do you have
that pretend one?

789
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,066
Because if I didn't,

790
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:19,202
your parents might not believe that I have a baby,

791
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:22,171
and I do have a baby.

792
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,240
- I can tell them.
- No! No, no, no.

793
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:28,311
It's gotta be
just between us, okay?

794
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:29,979
Just like
your training wheels.

795
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:34,017
You don't want your dad to take your bike away, right?

796
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,919
No.

797
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:37,720
So that's why
you can't say anything

798
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:41,991
or something really bad
is going to happen.

799
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:46,029
Pinkie promise?

800
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,000
Pinkie promise.

801
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:55,271
Hey, I have an idea.

802
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:06,616
(Cell phone vibrates)

803
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,386
Oh, I just got a text
from Bridgette.

804
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:31,874
(Door opens)

805
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:35,545
Sarah asked me to take Sully to the farm stand.

806
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:36,913
She did?

807
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,781
Mm-hmm.

808
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:42,552
Okay. We'll see you
at dinner?

809
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:44,454
Yep. We'll see you
at dinner.

810
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,499
(Knock on door)

811
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:04,073
Bridgette?

812
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:05,668
"To Joni.
Don't stop daring."

813
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:11,140
It's Joni.

814
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:13,142
I didn't hear
what you said.

815
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:15,645
Joni Mathers?
I was at the reading.

816
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:31,127
Not here.

817
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:49,979
It'll be
our little secret.

818
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,887
Bridgette.

819
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:00,189
Sully!

820
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:02,558
Sarah?

821
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,694
Robert?
What are you doing here?

822
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:06,529
Sully! Where's Sully?

823
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,164
She's with Bridgette
at the park.

824
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:09,699
She said
you said it was okay.

825
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:11,367
I'll be at the park,
okay?

826
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:13,603
Is everything okay?

827
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:23,846
And where were you,
Mr. Benson?

828
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:26,616
Here in my house.

829
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:28,985
Sheriff, why aren't we
out there looking for her?

830
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:30,686
You were in the house.

831
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:32,488
What made you go out looking for your daughter,
Mr. Benson?

832
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:34,957
No reason. I'm just
very protective of her.

833
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:38,027
It's not unusual, officer.
He gets very worried.

834
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:39,028
Because of her
medical condition.

835
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:40,863
Yes.

836
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:42,331
Sheriff, have you issued
some sort of alert?

837
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,367
Are you putting up
a roadblock?

838
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:47,303
Are you organizing
any sort of search party?

839
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:49,672
We have people working on this,
I can assure you.

840
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:51,007
I just want to get
a clearer picture

841
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:52,508
of this woman
Bridgette Gibson.

842
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:54,277
That may not even be
her real name.

843
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:58,281
I'm sorry. Do you
know something?

844
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,682
Well, no.
What is there to know?

845
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:01,150
She's taken our child.

846
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:04,187
She's pregnant and we're
adopting her baby.

847
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:06,289
We actually know
very little about her.

848
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,957
She seems very nice.

849
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:10,526
I'm sure this is just
a misunderstanding.

850
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:12,195
We're wasting time, okay?

851
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:13,729
Our child has been taken from us.
She's out there.

852
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:16,165
She's sick
and she's scared.

853
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,500
Is there any reason
at all

854
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:19,168
for you to think of
for Ms. Gibson

855
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:20,803
to want
to take your child?

856
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:24,540
No. She seems
to like us very much.

857
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:27,577
We like her. No.

858
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:28,811
Mr. Benson?

859
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,179
Huh?

860
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:32,048
Any reason she might
want to take Sully?

861
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:37,086
No, I can't think of any.

862
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,588
Look, I'm tired of
sitting around here.

863
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:40,223
I'm gonna go look
for her myself.

864
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:41,858
Chief, we got a picture
from the agency.

865
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:44,327
Okay, great. Let's
get that out there.

866
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,062
Pass it along
to the state.

867
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:47,997
This a current
picture?

868
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,867
No, that's not her.

869
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:53,369
That's the wrong photograph.
That isn't Bridgette Gibson.

870
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:56,906
We double-checked.
That's Bridgette Gibson.

871
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:02,144
Is there any possibility
that the woman

872
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:05,681
that's been living here
is not Bridgette Gibson?

873
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:26,969
We should be long gone.

874
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:32,808
This is perfect.

875
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:34,944
Everyone's gonna think we're
halfway out of the state by now.

876
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:36,579
Why are we still
in the area?

877
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:38,147
I mean, we should be
on our way

878
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:39,482
to Kansas City
or something right now.

879
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:42,251
Just stop worrying, okay?

880
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:44,720
I'd feel a lot safer
in a bigger city.

881
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,890
It's okay.

882
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,092
No one is gonna be
looking for us

883
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:51,661
on this side
of the lake,

884
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:53,562
so we stick to the plan.

885
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:58,634
What are you gonna say
to her when she wakes up?

886
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:01,470
Leave it to me, yeah?

887
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:02,939
(Sigh)

888
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:05,074
Hey.

889
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,475
Mm-hmm?

890
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:09,679
How rich are they, huh?

891
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:13,115
We will be getting
crazy money.

892
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,584
(Laughs)

893
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,420
Then we're
out of here, right?

894
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:20,222
Yeah, just the way
we planned it.

895
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:27,196
Hey, you don't think they're
looking for us, right?

896
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,298
They don't even know
you exist.

897
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:33,336
Oh, I can't wait
to change.

898
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:36,639
I don't know.
I kind of liked you with a big belly.

899
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:37,940
Please.

900
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,408
Just saying.

901
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:40,776
Don't start.

902
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:49,785
This is ridiculous.

903
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,455
Robert, please don't.

904
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,522
Sarah, come on.
One drink.

905
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:55,958
I'm going crazy.

906
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,293
We can't just sit here.

907
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:58,961
There's nothing
we can do.

908
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,029
Well, what are you doing?

909
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,731
I'm making a flyer.

910
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:03,933
I couldn't think of anything else.
I don't know.

911
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:05,835
I'm gonna put them
everywhere tomorrow.

912
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:13,242
I let you down.

913
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:16,078
I let everybody down.

914
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:20,483
Robert, please don't be
so hard on yourself.

915
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:21,584
It's not helpful.

916
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:26,288
You don't understand,
Sarah. I know her.

917
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:28,424
What?

918
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:36,699
I think I know her.
Bridgette.

919
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:41,370
I was on a book tour,
the last one.

920
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:44,874
When we lost the baby,
I went crazy

921
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:48,544
and I said yes
to every book tour.

922
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:52,048
I think it was a way for me
to get rid of the memory.

923
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:54,884
And I drank.

924
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:57,887
I drank every night
out on the road

925
00:50:57,921 --> 00:51:01,791
because I hated myself.

926
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:03,459
I hated everything.

927
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:05,528
The accident...

928
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:10,366
It was like I was trying
to kill myself.

929
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:17,073
And I hated you
for falling that day.

930
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:20,209
Robert...

931
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:23,779
I slept with her.

932
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:26,082
You slept
with Bridgette?

933
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:28,717
I was drunk.
I was wrong.

934
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,486
I don't know
what made me do it.

935
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:34,056
This morning,
I went into her room.

936
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,092
I knew something
wasn't right.

937
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:38,894
I found my book.

938
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,831
Inside I'd written a note
to some girl named Joni.

939
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:43,833
And all of a sudden,
it came flooding back.

940
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:46,168
I don't understand.

941
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:47,269
The picture the sheriff
showed us

942
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:49,939
is probably
the real Bridgette.

943
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:53,742
The girl who's been living with us is named Joni.

944
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,579
What does she want with us?
Why did she steal Sully?

945
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,581
I don't know. Revenge?

946
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,316
How could you do this?

947
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,251
I don't have an answer.
I was lost.

948
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,186
Why didn't you
just talk to me?

949
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:05,621
Don't I matter?

950
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:11,193
Sarah, I did something
that I can never take back,

951
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:15,764
and it consumes me
every day.

952
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:19,101
I know you hate me,
but I hate myself more.

953
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:22,771
If you think I hate you for cheating on me,
you underestimate me.

954
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:26,775
I hate you
for endangering our child.

955
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,545
My baby is out there without her
medicine with a crazy woman

956
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:31,213
because of you!

957
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:34,350
You did this!

958
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:37,853
How could you do this
to our family?

959
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,154
Hey, baby,
how you feeling?

960
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:16,425
Your hair.
You look different.

961
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:17,660
Do you like it?

962
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,061
I changed it.

963
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:20,763
Girls do that
all the time.

964
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,603
Where am I?

965
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:29,939
We're at
my friend's house.

966
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:31,707
We had so much fun
last night.

967
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:33,008
Do you remember?

968
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:37,213
Where's mommy and daddy?

969
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:38,948
They had an emergency,

970
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:41,684
so they asked me
to watch you.

971
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,086
What kind of emergency?

972
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,121
Their friend is sick

973
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:47,623
and he's in
the hospital,

974
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:50,426
so they're gonna be gone
for a few days.

975
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,394
Shouldn't we go home
and wait for them?

976
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:55,598
No.
I thought that you and I could play house here.

977
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:57,766
Me and you, all day.

978
00:53:57,801 --> 00:53:59,235
Doesn't that sound fun?

979
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:02,404
My tummy hurts.

980
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:06,242
Yeah?

981
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:08,244
Okay, I'm gonna go get you
something for your tummy.

982
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:10,212
You just stay here, okay?

983
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,548
- Okay.
- Okay.

984
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:21,123
I messed up.

985
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:22,625
Why? What's going on?

986
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:24,226
I should have grabbed
her medicine

987
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:25,628
for her pump
before I left the house.

988
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:27,263
Hold on. I can go
get some medicine.

989
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:28,897
No, that's not
going to work.

990
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,299
It's prescription,
dummy.

991
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:32,101
Well, what's she got?

992
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:34,136
She's some kind
of diabetic.

993
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:36,305
Oh, hell,
my brother had that.

994
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:38,674
Yeah, it's low blood sugar.

995
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:40,476
We used to give him
a couple candy bars

996
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:41,944
and he'd be good to go.

997
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:45,147
She doesn't look
too good.

998
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:48,917
Well, seeing as how
you can't go into town,

999
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:52,921
I guess I'll have to
go get us some candy, then.

1000
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,923
Thank you.

1001
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:58,427
In the meantime, you
call that daddy of hers

1002
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,329
and tell him his
little girl is sick

1003
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:01,964
and needs his help, yeah?

1004
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:07,469
Oh, and tell him to get his
some money, too, huh?

1005
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,208
So you saw this girl Bridgette get out of a truck.

1006
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:14,310
What kind of truck?

1007
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:15,444
Just a regular
pickup truck.

1008
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:16,478
What make?

1009
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:17,680
I don't know.

1010
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:19,848
Older. Not too old.

1011
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:21,216
It was green and white.

1012
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:24,153
You get
a license plate number?

1013
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:26,388
No. It happened
really fast.

1014
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:28,290
All right, tell me
about the guy.

1015
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:30,559
Um, he was scruffy.

1016
00:55:30,593 --> 00:55:32,628
You know, had
a five o'clock shadow.

1017
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,363
He was wearing jeans.

1018
00:55:34,397 --> 00:55:36,965
Maybe cowboy boots.

1019
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,300
He was kind of handsome

1020
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,903
in that redneck
kind of way.

1021
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:42,705
He was young,
about her age.

1022
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:45,040
She definitely knew him.

1023
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:46,909
Why didn't you tell
the Bensons

1024
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,144
you saw Bridgette
with a strange man?

1025
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,713
Robert, Mr. Benson,
would freak out.

1026
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:52,348
He's a bundle of nerves.

1027
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:54,183
You afraid of him?

1028
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:55,384
Mr. Benson? No.

1029
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:57,019
Has he ever been
violent around you?

1030
00:55:57,053 --> 00:55:59,421
No. Look, you're barking
up the wrong tree.

1031
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:01,190
Mr. Benson might be
a little cold,

1032
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:03,859
but he'd never
hurt Sully.

1033
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:05,027
Well, from what
I'm learning,

1034
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:06,562
he's got
an interesting past.

1035
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:10,966
I just hope she's okay.

1036
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,368
We'll find her.

1037
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,935
- (Cell phone rings)
- Hello?

1038
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:22,137
Sarah, listen, I'm headed
toward the lake cabin.

1039
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:24,506
- What?
- I'm following a guy who I think may have Sully.

1040
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:26,775
- Charlie, I cant--
- Hello?

1041
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:28,444
Really?

1042
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:45,320
(Crunch)

1043
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,076
Looking for something?

1044
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:16,385
Are you that stupid?

1045
00:59:16,419 --> 00:59:18,720
Babe, this only makes
the decision easier.

1046
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:19,922
Hey, let's just get
the hell outta town.

1047
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:23,091
No. We're sticking
with my plan.

1048
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:25,127
Hey, Charlie.

1049
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:33,535
Sully better be alive.

1050
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:34,703
Oh, she's alive.

1051
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:37,306
Shut up, Dwayne.

1052
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:39,107
Police are already
looking for you.

1053
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:42,477
They know all about your
criminal friend here.

1054
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:47,449
You've got a really
big mouth, Charlie.

1055
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:51,286
What are you gonna do,
lock me up with Sully?

1056
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:56,291
I can't afford that.

1057
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:59,127
What are you gonna do?

1058
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:02,931
I ain't gonna do nothing.

1059
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:12,274
Well, Charles, you were
right about two things.

1060
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:17,446
She's insane
and I'm a criminal.

1061
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,916
No. No, please don't.

1062
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:30,892

We did some checking up
with your adoption agency

1070
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:11,733
to see if we
can locate anyone

1071
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:13,135
who might know
Ms. Gibson.

1072
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:15,137
Yes. I told you.
Ellen Macy.

1073
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,938
She's the one that did
the background check.

1074
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:21,743
Unfortunately, we're not gonna get much out of Ms.
Macy now.

1075
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:23,478
She's dead.

1076
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,814
She's dead?

1077
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:26,848
She was found
in her apartment.

1078
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:28,016
Police are still
investigating.

1079
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:32,487
Do you recognize
this man, Mrs. Benson?

1080
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:36,024
Uh, no. Should I?

1081
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:37,592
He was spotted
with Ms. Joni Mathers

1082
01:01:37,627 --> 01:01:39,061
by a friend of yours,
Charlie Holmes.

1083
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:40,362
His name
is Dwayne Tisdale.

1084
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:41,663
He's wanted in Texas

1085
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,065
in connection with
two murders down there.

1086
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:45,734
What does that have to do
with Bridgette-- Joni?

1087
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:48,570
Not sure yet.

1088
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:50,572
Do you know where your
husband is, Mrs. Benson?

1089
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:55,610
He's out
looking for her.

1090
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:58,413
We had a fight.

1091
01:01:58,448 --> 01:02:01,049
Well, in light of what you
told me about him and Joni,

1092
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:04,886
is it possible that
they're together right now?

1093
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:17,532
Hey, are you sure
this is a good idea?

1094
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:22,204
You want your money,
don't you?

1095
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:24,973
What if we just call
the dad and--

1096
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:26,708
It has to be this way.

1097
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,244
Yeah, but they're
looking for you.

1098
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,547
You feeling better,
sweetie?

1099
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,983
I don't feel good.

1100
01:02:35,017 --> 01:02:36,885
I know. I know.

1101
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:38,887
Well, I'm gonna go
rent us a boat

1102
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:42,624
so we can get out
on the lake, okay?

1103
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:44,126
I think I need
my medicine.

1104
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,595
And we're gonna get some
for you real soon.

1105
01:02:46,629 --> 01:02:47,929
But you need to eat
some candy first.

1106
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:49,965
It's gonna help you
feel so much better.

1107
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:51,399
Dwayne, the candy.

1108
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:57,839
All right,
just a few bites.

1109
01:02:57,874 --> 01:03:00,108
And then maybe you can try and
sleep while I go rent us a boat.

1110
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:02,511
Dwayne will be here
the whole time.

1111
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:07,415
My daddy won't let me
go on boats.

1112
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,151
Well, just because your dad is scared of the water

1113
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:11,853
doesn't mean your dad and I can't go for boat rides.

1114
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:13,088
And when you're older,

1115
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:14,556
maybe I'll even
let you drive.

1116
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:17,459
But right now I need you to rest, okay, sweetie?

1117
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:27,969
Hey! Hey!

1118
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:29,971
What now, Dwayne?

1119
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:31,339
Hold up.
Come here. Come here.

1120
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:33,775
What was that all about
back there, huh?

1121
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:36,344
- What? Boat rides?
- What?

1122
01:03:36,379 --> 01:03:38,847
We're not keeping
the kid.

1123
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:41,183
Obviously. I was just trying
to make her feel good.

1124
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:43,518
You're a paranoid
son of a bitch.

1125
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:45,821
Hey, don't walk away from me when I'm talking to you!

1126
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:47,522
Come here!

1127
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:49,791
You better not be
messing around with me.

1128
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,627
I'm in this for the money and nothing else.

1129
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,563
Yeah, I'm gonna get you
your money and my money.

1130
01:03:54,597 --> 01:03:56,031
You stay here with the girl

1131
01:03:56,065 --> 01:03:57,999
and you try and stay out
of sight this time, okay?

1132
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:00,535
Okay.

1133
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:23,358
Sorry, I'm closing.

1134
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:27,896
Please.
I'll only be an hour.

1135
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:33,935
Okay. Paddle board
or canoe? What kind?

1136
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:36,204
I saw that you guys
had outboards out there.

1137
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:38,340
Oh, you know
how to run 'em?

1138
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:40,876
How much is it?

1139
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:45,013
50. Going fishing?

1140
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:46,615
Here's 50.

1141
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:27,822
(Tapping)

1142
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:37,532
Hello, Sarah.

1143
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:42,737
Bridgette, What have you
done with Sully?

1144
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:45,106
- Please!
- She's okay.

1145
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:46,274
She's okay.

1146
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:49,077
My God,
you're not pregnant.

1147
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:52,080
No, I never was.

1148
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:54,416
Don't worry about Sully.
She's fine. She's safe.

1149
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:56,551
Bridgette, please,
please tell me where she is.

1150
01:05:56,585 --> 01:05:58,286
You're never gonna
see her again.

1151
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:00,789
I'm her new mom now.

1152
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:04,726
Robert and I are going
to take her away.

1153
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,528
Robert's with you?

1154
01:06:06,562 --> 01:06:09,064
Mm-hmm.
He'll be here soon.

1155
01:06:09,098 --> 01:06:11,900
Do you know how crazy
this sounds?

1156
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:12,901
Don't call me crazy.

1157
01:06:12,935 --> 01:06:14,736
Bridgette, wait!
Please.

1158
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:16,438
Shut up!

1159
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:20,408
You are pathetic.

1160
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:24,746
The second I met you,
I knew I didn't like you.

1161
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:26,648
Your stupid fruit stand

1162
01:06:26,682 --> 01:06:27,949
and your organic
vegetables.

1163
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,050
Bridgette, please!

1164
01:06:29,085 --> 01:06:31,119
My name's Joni,
by the way.

1165
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:33,989
You need to know
something, Sarah.

1166
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:36,257
Robert doesn't love you.

1167
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:38,727
He told me so.

1168
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:41,096
He blames you
for the accident.

1169
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:43,098
And he loves me.

1170
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:46,134
But why take Sully?
What does she have to do with any of this?

1171
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:48,436
(Laughs)
That night...

1172
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:53,141
That night when he was
making love to me,

1173
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:56,444
I got pregnant
with his child.

1174
01:06:56,479 --> 01:07:00,615
I carried him around for three months,
and I lost him.

1175
01:07:00,649 --> 01:07:05,987
And then right when I was feeling like a dirty little slut,

1176
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:08,323
I turn on the TV
and I see your face

1177
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:10,792
and his face
and his daughter's face,

1178
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:12,660
and I didn't like that
very much.

1179
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:20,001
I hate you for
stealing him away from me.

1180
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:23,371
Bridgette, please.
You're sick, okay?

1181
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:25,040
Let me help you.
Give me the gun.

1182
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:27,842
(Laughs)

1183
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:30,645
I already told you
my name's Joni.

1184
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:34,115
This is perfect.

1185
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:37,452
Sarah is so upset
about losing her baby,

1186
01:07:37,486 --> 01:07:40,655
people are gonna think
it's a suicide.

1187
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:42,557
Just like Charlie.

1188
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:15,723
(Engine starts)

1189
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:33,108
Sarah?

1190
01:08:33,142 --> 01:08:37,078
Hello? Sarah?

1191
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,114
Sarah?

1192
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:41,916
Robert.

1193
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:45,019
Bridgette!

1194
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:47,922
No, you can call me
Joni now.

1195
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,457
Where's Sarah?

1196
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:51,559
You don't have to worry
about Sarah anymore.

1197
01:08:51,594 --> 01:08:53,061
It's fine.
I have Sully.

1198
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:54,129
Sarah?

1199
01:08:54,163 --> 01:08:56,798
No, no.
Don't you get it?

1200
01:08:56,832 --> 01:09:00,301
You're free.
We're free to be happy.

1201
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:02,403
- What did you do to her?
- I took care of her.

1202
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:05,273
Where is she?

1203
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:07,976
Robert, you're acting
very strange.

1204
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:09,944
Don't you get it?

1205
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,579
We have everything, okay?

1206
01:09:11,614 --> 01:09:13,314
We can start
our lives together.

1207
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:15,416
This is what
we always wanted.

1208
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:17,318
What are you
talking about?

1209
01:09:17,353 --> 01:09:19,621
You know what?
I'm calling the police.

1210
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:22,624
You weren't happy.
You told me you weren't happy.

1211
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:27,762
I don't
understand you, okay?

1212
01:09:27,796 --> 01:09:29,931
Don't do that!

1213
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:32,267
We don't have much time to get away.
We have to get away.

1214
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:34,602
Hello, yes, can I speak
to Sheriff Watson, please?

1215
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:35,904
Put the phone down!

1216
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:38,907
Oh!

1217
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:44,312
Oh, God.

1218
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:48,416
Please don't make me
shoot you again.

1219
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:49,984
- Oh, you're sick.
- No, I'm not.

1220
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:55,023
Okay, Joni, put
the gun down, all right?

1221
01:09:55,057 --> 01:09:56,858
Let's just talk about this.

1222
01:09:56,892 --> 01:09:59,093
You told me
you didn't love her.

1223
01:09:59,128 --> 01:10:00,929
Tell me where Sully is,
and we'll forget this ever happened.

1224
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:03,831
I thought this is what you wanted.
I don't understand.

1225
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:06,034
Just put it down,
all right?

1226
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:14,609
- Aah!
- Oh!

1227
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:17,245
Robert!

1228
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:22,850
No! I didn't mean to!

1229
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:26,788
I didn't mean to.
(Crying)

1230
01:10:55,517 --> 01:10:58,052
We gotta go.
Where is she?

1231
01:10:58,087 --> 01:10:59,387
Hey, you got the money?

1232
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:01,089
Where is Sully?

1233
01:11:01,123 --> 01:11:03,091
She's in the bathroom.
She's not feeling too good.

1234
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:05,093
Oh, damn it.
I forgot her medicine.

1235
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:06,928
We have to clear out.
Where's your gun?

1236
01:11:06,962 --> 01:11:08,496
It's on the table.

1237
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:11,733
Hey, you got the money?

1238
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:13,434
(Knock on door)
Sully, baby girl!

1239
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:14,969
Hey, what happened?

1240
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:18,973
I don't feel good.

1241
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:21,075
I know. I know, baby.

1242
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:26,180
Listen, baby,
your daddy is dead,

1243
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:29,517
but you and I
are gonna be fine.

1244
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:31,319
We have to go.

1245
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:34,756
You screwed up,
didn't you, huh?

1246
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:36,491
You ain't got no money.

1247
01:11:36,525 --> 01:11:39,460
Hey, I told you what was gonna
happen if you messed with me!

1248
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:40,628
Now I'm taking the girl.

1249
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:41,729
Let her go!

1250
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:44,766
Yeah? Or what? Huh?

1251
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,803
We weren't getting money
out of this anyway.

1252
01:11:48,837 --> 01:11:50,038
It was about him
the whole time.

1253
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:53,007
It was about
the husband.

1254
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:55,610
Imagine a guy like that with a crazy whore like you.

1255
01:11:56,912 --> 01:11:59,881
I'm warning you.

1256
01:11:59,915 --> 01:12:01,149
What are you
gonna do, huh?

1257
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:03,451
What, are you
gonna shoot her?

1258
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:06,654
Are you gonna
shoot me? Huh?

1259
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:09,223
I said to let her go.

1260
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:10,992
Yeah, I'll let her go,

1261
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:13,895
as soon as I get
my half a million.

1262
01:12:13,929 --> 01:12:14,896
- Aah!
- Oh!

1263
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:17,665
I want my mom!

1264
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:19,133
You shot me!

1265
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:21,002
Your mommy
is already dead.

1266
01:12:21,036 --> 01:12:22,870
I'm your new mom now.

1267
01:12:22,905 --> 01:12:25,406
(Groans)

1268
01:12:43,258 --> 01:12:45,593
(coughs)

1269
01:12:56,572 --> 01:12:58,239
Sarah.

1270
01:13:00,342 --> 01:13:01,776
Sarah.

1271
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:11,719
Sarah? Sarah?

1272
01:13:11,754 --> 01:13:15,590
(Coughs)

1273
01:13:15,624 --> 01:13:18,025
Jesus! Sarah!

1274
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,360
Sarah.

1275
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:52,093
Sarah, breathe!

1276
01:13:54,062 --> 01:13:57,265
Sarah, breathe!

1277
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:02,403
Oh, you're okay.

1278
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:05,273
Robert, Robert,
she has our baby.

1279
01:14:05,307 --> 01:14:07,442
I know. I know.

1280
01:14:07,476 --> 01:14:10,845
Charlie tried to tell me
about the cabin.

1281
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:12,313
Across the lake?

1282
01:14:12,347 --> 01:14:14,015
- Yeah.
- Yes?

1283
01:14:14,049 --> 01:14:15,683
Robert, you're hurt.

1284
01:14:15,717 --> 01:14:17,685
It's my fault.

1285
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:19,687
I blamed you
for everything.

1286
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:22,256
I was wrong.
I'm so sorry.

1287
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,958
I'm gonna go get her.

1288
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:26,027
How?

1289
01:14:26,061 --> 01:14:28,996
Well, she won't
drive back into town.

1290
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:34,402
The only other way out of Storm
Lake is across Mackinaw Bridge.

1291
01:14:34,436 --> 01:14:38,272
Robert, you can't.

1292
01:14:57,025 --> 01:14:58,392
Where are you taking me?

1293
01:14:58,427 --> 01:14:59,794
Somewhere safe, sweetie,
where no one can get us.

1294
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:01,796
I don't wanna go with you!
You're mean!

1295
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,564
Don't say that!
I am not mean!

1296
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:04,932
I am the only nice one!

1297
01:15:04,967 --> 01:15:06,868
Everyone else
wants to hurt us.

1298
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:40,434
Hands up!

1299
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:44,005
Hands up.

1300
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:47,742
Where's the girl?

1301
01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:49,544
The crazy bitch
just took off

1302
01:15:49,578 --> 01:15:51,712
about 15 minutes ago.

1303
01:15:51,747 --> 01:15:52,947
Where were they headed?

1304
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:54,015
I don't know.

1305
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:56,350
Call for an ambulance.

1306
01:15:56,385 --> 01:16:00,621
She shot me and she's
probably gonna kill that kid!

1307
01:16:00,656 --> 01:16:02,957
Dwayne Tisdale,
you are under arrest.

1308
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:04,191
She shot me!

1309
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:06,427
You have the right
to remain silent.

1310
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:08,229
Anything you say can
and will be used--

1311
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:24,372
Daddy.

1312
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:30,244
They're all the same.

1313
01:17:30,345 --> 01:17:33,047
Why do they
have to hurt me?

1314
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:35,883
No! You're gonna hurt him!

1315
01:17:37,619 --> 01:17:38,753
We don't need him!

1316
01:17:38,854 --> 01:17:40,154
No! You're
gonna kill him!

1317
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:42,089
Let go! I'm your
new mother now!

1318
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:44,925
You're not my mom!

1319
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:49,430
- (Shouts)
- (heavy thud)

1320
01:17:57,372 --> 01:17:59,140
Sully!

1321
01:18:07,315 --> 01:18:09,016
Daddy!

1322
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:11,886
(Groans)

1323
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,058
Sully?

1324
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:22,296
It's okay.

1325
01:18:22,397 --> 01:18:24,265
It's okay.
You're okay, all right?

1326
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:26,200
I have your insulin
in the boat, all right?

1327
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:30,304
It's all over.
Mommy's waiting for us.

1328
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:32,473
(Gunshot)

1329
01:18:36,244 --> 01:18:38,412
You can't take her,
Robert.

1330
01:18:38,513 --> 01:18:39,714
Joni, please,
she's dying.

1331
01:18:39,815 --> 01:18:41,882
I need to give her
her medicine.

1332
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:44,351
You don't think
I'm a good mother.

1333
01:18:44,453 --> 01:18:46,887
You think I'm nothing.

1334
01:18:46,988 --> 01:18:49,757
You used me, Robert.

1335
01:18:49,858 --> 01:18:51,425
You are never gonna
use me again.

1336
01:18:51,526 --> 01:18:54,095
I'm taking her from you.

1337
01:18:54,196 --> 01:18:56,664
- Daddy...
- It's okay.

1338
01:18:56,765 --> 01:19:00,868
Robert! I'm gonna
shoot you both!

1339
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:04,772
Daddy?

1340
01:19:06,108 --> 01:19:08,309
Robert!

1341
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,711
- Listen to me.
- I'm scared.

1342
01:19:10,812 --> 01:19:12,780
I'm scared, too,

1343
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:15,015
but I need you to do something,
all right? (Whispers)

1344
01:19:15,117 --> 01:19:18,686
Last chance, Robert!

1345
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:20,087
Okay?

1346
01:19:20,188 --> 01:19:24,759
I trust you, okay?

1347
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:26,160
Okay.

1348
01:19:28,964 --> 01:19:31,866
That's a smart choice.

1349
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:38,239
We could have
had everything.

1350
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:41,275
We could have had
a happy life together.

1351
01:19:43,311 --> 01:19:46,080
But you're a selfish coward

1352
01:19:46,181 --> 01:19:48,916
and a liar just like
the rest of them!

1353
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:52,386
Come on, let's get
out of here.

1354
01:19:54,389 --> 01:19:58,993
Come here.
Baby, come on.

1355
01:20:26,955 --> 01:20:28,055

1362
01:22:10,358 --> 01:22:12,993
Look at you.
Not a care in the world.

1363
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:14,328
She can't be a baby forever.

1364
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:16,864
At some point, you
just have to trust her.

1365

That is very wise.
Some good parenting.
