00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,910
That part we don't know.

889
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:56,605
BEN:
Hang on...

890
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,240
You said in your message
that you had all the answers,

891
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:00,771
but you haven't got all the answers!

892
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,374
We're trying to help you!

893
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:03,646
We've got a few of the answers.

894
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:05,347
If you said you had only
a few of the answers,

895
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:07,117
we wouldn't have bothered
driving all the way down here!

896
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:10,125
Ben! What about this film'?
Who is that'?

897
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,626
We're not sure,

898
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,323
but we've got a good idea
where it is.

899
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:16,126
That tower'?

900
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,894
It's about an hour away.

901
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:19,662
DWAYNE: At first we thought the
video was some kind of curse.

902
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:22,500
You watch it and die,
that sort of thing - like Saw.

903
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:24,199
You mean The Ring.

904
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:25,673
Anyway, we've seen something, too,

905
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:27,175
and it beats that video.

906
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:30,406
Oh, yeah'? What'?

907
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:32,072
A blue monster.

908
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:34,412
We call it "the Blue Monster".

909
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:36,418
[Scoffs]
Good name!

910
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,817
BEN:
It is, actually.

911
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:42,758
What is it'?

912
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,589
It's like a big, sort of mutant.

913
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:46,754
We saw it in New York
and it attacked us.

914
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:48,286
Maybe it's one of them -

915
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:49,490
one of the aliens.

916
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,500
Perhaps that's it -

917
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,992
they're hunting us, like Predator.

918
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,005
Pity Schwarzenegger's
not around...

919
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,836
Yeah, or Danny Glover.

920
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,864
What, like in Predator 2'?
I don't think so.

921
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:03,504
Ben, why don't you
go check on Kill'?

922
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,411
Don't you tell me what to do!

923
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,744
I'm going to check on Kill...

924
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,521
We need to go to this tower.

925
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:13,920
We'll come with you!

926
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:15,218
I suppose you can come...

927
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,750
Kill's gone missing!

928
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:21,725
We have to find her!

929
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:23,663
- Is she dangerous'?
- Yes.

930
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:25,530
No! She's not dangerous,
she's just...

931
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,035
misunderstood.

932
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,434
God, what if
she's been kidnapped'?

933
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:29,938
She's just run off. She's insane!

934
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,236
She's not insane.
She wouldn't leave me like that.

935
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:34,208
I'm not walking around looking
for some crazy girl.

936
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,904
We have to find her.
We can't just leave her!

937
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:38,413
Ben, you're being ridiculous.
Let her go! She's mental.

938
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:40,039
If you won't help me,
I'll just go on my own!

939
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,380
Oh sure, like you can
take care of yourself.

940
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,976
- Shut your mouth!
- Okay!

941
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:45,213
I've got an idea...

942
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,494
This cap is itchy.

943
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:56,489
This is perfect!

944
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,295
That camera can see
twice as far as you can

945
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:00,097
<i>and can spot any trouble
before you're near H.</i>

946
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:01,603
Well, I think you're all cowards.

947
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:03,104
You want to look for
your crazy girlfriend?

948
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:03,935
You're on your own!

949
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:04,871
What did he say'?

950
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:07,569
Nothing.
He said, "Good luck!"

951
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:08,770
Okay, come on, let's go.

952
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:11,477
Kill?

953
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:14,714
Kill!

954
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:15,478
<i>STEPHEN". We could be here
for hours, Ben.</i>

955
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:16,985
<i>You do know that, right'?</i>

956
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:18,987
I don't care.
I want to find Kill.

957
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:20,989
- <i>I'm sure she Wants to find you as Well.</i>
- <i>She does!</i>

958
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:27,087
<i>U I q</i>

959
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,528
Wait, where are you going'?

960
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:32,300
[Scream]

961
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:34,802
BEN: What? What's Wrong?
What's wrong is the blue monster!

962
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:36,702
<i>What are you talking about?
There's nobody here.</i>

963
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:39,833
It's right in front of you!
I'm looking at it on the screen!

964
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:41,843
The blue monster is -

965
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:43,606
Ben, did you turn your cap around'?

966
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:46,848
[Monster growling]

967
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,611
[Ben screaming]

968
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,982
Rum!!!

969
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:52,647
[Stephen and Ben screaming]

970
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:55,156
[Monster roaring]

971
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:56,681
BEN:
Where am <i>I</i> going?

972
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:59,216
Run northeast, Ben!
Northeast!

973
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:01,286
Forward, backward, left or right'?

974
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,525
Just run!
Run as fast as you can!

975
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:05,534
I am running as fast as I can!

976
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:07,035
Is that the blue monster'?

977
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:08,536
I can't see!
Tell him to stand still!

978
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,038
I don't know
where I'm going!

979
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,539
Just get back here! Run!

980
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:13,041
He can't lead that back here!

981
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:15,043
Yeah, tell him to shake it off.

982
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:16,544
[Monster roaring]

983
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:19,548
Ben, you need to shake off
the blue monster.

984
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,413
<i>BEN".
Shake him off?</i>

985
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:23,509
l-low exactly do you
expect me to shake him -

986
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,951
Ovv!

987
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:26,454
What's happening'?

988
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:28,888
BEN: <i>Fm just failing
over some bins.</i>

989
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:30,482
<i>STEPHEN". He's just
falling over some bins.</i>

990
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:34,660
BEN: <i>Now Fm just roiling
down</i> a <i>hill...</i>

991
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:38,362
<i>He says he's just
rolling down</i> a <i>hill.</i>

992
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:42,571
<i>Where's the blue monster?</i>

993
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:43,799
I've lost him.

994
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:45,067
<i>STEPHEN".
He says he's lost him.</i>

995
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,409
Where did it go'?

996
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:50,002
Does it just disappear'?

997
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,637
No, it's normally pretty vicious.

998
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:53,409
<i>H likes attacking people.</i>

999
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:54,575
Ben, get back here!

1000
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:55,948
That's not a good idea.

1001
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:57,577
We can't just
leave him outside!

1002
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:59,087
He wanted to go
in the first place.

1003
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:00,713
He's put us in danger now!

1004
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:04,290
Are you sure
he's lost the monster'?

1005
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:06,055
Yeah...

1006
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,187
Of course he has.

1007
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:11,399
<i>And he'll be stealthily
making his Way back right now.</i>

1008
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:21,999
Password'?

1009
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:24,635
"Waffles."

1010
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:34,122
JACK:
What happened'?

1011
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:35,555
I outran it.

1012
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,025
There's no way you
can outrun that thing!

1013
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:39,823
You told me to run
as fast as I could,

1014
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,090
and that's what I did.

1015
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:43,428
It's obviously faster than
the blue monster can run.

1016
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:44,830
He let you get away!

1017
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:46,198
"Not this ship, sister."

1018
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:47,600
I know that one -
Empire Strikes Back!

1019
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:49,194
Star Wars, actually.

1020
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:51,206
- We shouldn't have answered your SOS!
- Dwayne!

1021
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:52,866
It's true!
He led that thing right to us!

1022
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:54,204
If you've got a problem with me,

1023
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:55,539
you should just come out
and say it.

1024
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:57,044
Okay, I've got a problem with you.

1025
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:59,047
- Yeah, what problem'?
- You're a big, hairy dick!

1026
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:00,309
Yeah, well, you'd know.

1027
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:01,975
Okay, calm down.
Nothing's happened, alright?

1028
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:03,484
- Nobody's got hurt.
- What about Kill'?

1029
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:04,986
L-low do you know
she hasn't been hurt'?

1030
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:06,487
- Go look for her again!
- I will!

1031
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:07,818
- Ben, shut up.
- You shut up.

1032
00:49:07,844 --> 00:49:09,323
- No, you shut up!
- You can shut up!

1033
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:11,326
Everybody shut up!

1034
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:12,918
We need to work out
what to do.

1035
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,429
I've already
worked out what to do.

1036
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,124
We stay here and make sure
that monster,

1037
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:17,689
whatever it is, doesn't get in.

1038
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:18,722
Staying put isn't going
to get us anywhere.

1039
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:20,029
Yeah, that's the idea.

1040
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:21,297
Why don't you go and shove -

1041
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:22,326
Let's get going!

1042
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:23,429
We can all fit in the car.

1043
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,871
- What about Kill'?
- Screw Kill!

1044
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:27,136
- I'll screw you in a minute.
- I'd like to see you try!

1045
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:28,643
Shut up.

1046
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:32,135
Okay, we need to
find this beacon...

1047
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:35,639
and we'll look for your
friend along the way.

1048
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:37,652
BEN:
Wait.

1049
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:39,654
You guys need to
know something.

1050
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:41,553
It's not good.

1051
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:43,649
What is it'?

1052
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,286
I trod in some dog shit outside

1053
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,626
and I think I got some
on your stairs.

1054
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,239
Where's Jack and Dwayne?

1055
00:49:58,261 --> 00:49:59,638
They're just
getting their coats...

1056
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,836
and I think Jack wanted to
clear up that dog shit.

1057
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:03,310
At least we've got
some company now.

1058
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:07,804
Safety in numbers!

1059
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,819
[Roaring]

1060
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:16,057
STEPHEN:

01:06:33,222 --> 01:06:35,668
Prove it.

1407
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:38,137
[Energy humming]

1408
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:42,935
Fair enough.

1409
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:45,045
<i>Kill!</i>

1410
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:47,047
Nothing's wrong, Killie.
We're fine. Just relax.

1411
01:06:47,069 --> 01:06:48,844
Well, she doesn't look fine...

1412
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:51,147
In fact, she kind of
looks like a zombie.

1413
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:53,016
I told you already,
we are not zombies.

1414
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:55,545
We just watch DVDs -
zombies don't watch DVDs.

1415
01:06:55,578 --> 01:06:56,921
Don't move!

1416
01:06:56,946 --> 01:06:58,926
Kill!

1417
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:02,759
This coffee's quite nice.

1418
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:04,696
I must take some back with me.

1419
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,358
If you've come to rescue us,

1420
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:07,925
why make us come here'?

1421
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:10,437
Why not just suck us up again'?

1422
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:12,735
Our sucking machine
is low on power.

1423
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:15,868
I have to manually beam you up
from a specific point.

1424
01:07:15,898 --> 01:07:18,003
It's a pain in the ass,
to be honest.

1425
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,310
But you could have just said,
"Come here."

1426
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:22,373
You didn't have to
make that weird video.

1427
01:07:22,405 --> 01:07:24,112
The video is subliminal.

1428
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:26,484
It gives instruction
without you having to think.

1429
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:28,147
I'm rather proud of it, actually -

1430
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:30,316
although it would have
been better with some music.

1431
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:31,689
What about the blue monster'?

1432
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:35,355
Is that some galactic race
you've been battling for centuries'?

1433
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:36,863
The blue monsters
[chuckles]

1434
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:39,366
- No, Stephanie...
- Uh, Stephen.

1435
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:41,368
They're nothing to worry about.

1436
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:43,870
- They just like to chase things.
- No, they do more than that.

1437
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:45,668
Honestly, they're harmless.

1438
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:48,368
Besides, you've got bigger
things to be worrying about.

1439
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:51,310
We must beam up to the ship
before the disaster strikes!

1440
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:52,812
The disaster being...

1441
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:54,644
Why, the asteroid, of course.

1442
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:56,980
A giant asteroid is going
to strike planet Earth

1443
01:07:57,006 --> 01:07:59,509
and destroy all life upon it.

1444
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:01,021
<i>Kill!</i>

01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:02,113

I see you're Canadian -
do you like hockey'? I like hockey!

1447
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:06,384
And I like maple syrup, and...

1448
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:07,621
what else does Canada have'?

1449
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:08,628
Kill!

No!

Whoa! Too slow, big boy!

1457

[Ben sobbing]

1458
01:08:45,154 --> 01:08:48,863
[Man laughs] I could shoot
you down there, you know...

1459
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:51,132
like a real pig.

1460
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:53,731
Like a real, fat pig in the dirt!

1461
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:56,436
[Cackle]
You know what's funny'?

1462
01:08:57,266 --> 01:08:59,246
I said, do you know
what's funny'?!

1463
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:01,248
No, what'?

1464
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:05,776
Well... It's just that I've been
pretty lonely since everybody left.

1465
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,788
But having met you two, well,

1466
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:11,519
I've come to realize
I much prefer being on my own.

1467
01:09:11,547 --> 01:09:14,153
So you're going to let me go'?

1468
01:09:14,183 --> 01:09:15,662
Let you go?

1469
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:17,288
So you can just
creep back in here

1470
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,026
in the middle of the night
and eat me'?!

1471
01:09:19,054 --> 01:09:21,261
I told you,
I'm not a zombie -

1472
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:24,464
and neither was Killie!
[Sobbing]

1473
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:26,473
Are you sure about that'?

1474
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:29,704
'Cause she looked like a zombie.

1475
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:31,678
And you're definitely
dumb enough to be one.

1476
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,680
Well, you're wrong!
Really wrong!

1477
01:09:33,702 --> 01:09:35,682
Am I now'?

1478
01:09:35,704 --> 01:09:40,175
Well, pig boy, that's because
you do not know what I know...

1479
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:42,689
That the whole
population of the world

1480
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:44,418
has turned into zombies,

1481
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:47,256
and they've all
marched off someplace

1482
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:49,729
to prepare to take over...

1483
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:51,254
Zombie Earth.

1484
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:53,392
That's the stupidest theory!

1485
01:09:53,422 --> 01:09:55,732
Stupid'?
Who you calling stupid'?!

1486
01:09:55,758 --> 01:09:58,898
I'm sorry! I meant to say
that's an excellent theory!

1487
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:03,401
Now, I've been
wonderin' somethin'...

1488
01:10:03,432 --> 01:10:05,742

I've been vvonderin'?

01:10:15,444 --> 01:10:17,481

Without any skin'?

1494
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:26,064
Well, it's just that I've skinned
a lot of animals in my time...

1495
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:29,700
But a man'?

1496
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:31,705
I ain't never skinned a man before.

1497
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:33,001
We could just talk.

1498
01:10:33,028 --> 01:10:34,905
We could talk about
anything you want!

1499
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:36,773
Have you ever been to England'?

1500
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:38,779
It's really nice!
You'd like it there...

1501
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:40,371
Although the food's
not that great.

1502
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:42,382
I'm done talkin'.

1503
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:45,715

be too busy screamin'!

Come on!

1505

take my skin off!

It's alright, little piggy.
It's going to be okay!

Are you all right'?

1512
01:11:09,632 --> 01:11:11,373
What the hell was that'?

1513
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,879
Did he hurt you'?

1514
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:13,936
Yes, he hurt me...

1515
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:18,384
And he tried to take off my skin!

1516
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:20,751
We heard a gunshot.
What are you doing here'?

1517
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:22,756
We had to leave the house.

1518
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:24,553
There was shit coming
out of the taps...

1519
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:26,150
Now who is he,

1520
01:11:26,181 --> 01:11:28,161
and how did he shoot
a laser out of his hand'?

1521
01:11:28,183 --> 01:11:31,653
This is going to sound weird,
but he's an alien.

1522
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:33,667

She was trying to protect me!

1526
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:43,969
You can shoot lasers
out of your hands -

1527
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:47,105
I don't suppose you can
bring the dead back to life, can you'?

1528
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:49,082
- Yes.
- What?

1529
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:51,744
I can bring the dead back to life.

1530

This is my death hand,

01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:56,886

1532
01:11:56,912 --> 01:11:58,687

- Yeah, we need to talk...

Alright, you can start
by apologizing.

You called me a lazy,

Alright, I'm sorry, too.

actually call me that'?
