1
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,549
Is it risky? yes.

2
00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:29,353
Is it going to get you that
vacation house in the Hamptons?

3
00:00:29,377 --> 00:00:31,422
Absolutely!

4
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:32,728
You can save me the guest room

5
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:35,122
actually, make that me plus one.

6
00:00:35,165 --> 00:00:37,559
Gotta go!

7
00:00:37,602 --> 00:00:38,734
Harrison burk

8
00:00:38,777 --> 00:00:40,083
Grits my man!

9
00:00:40,127 --> 00:00:47,221
Floor seats? Nicks? 8 o'clock?
I'm there!

10
00:00:47,264 --> 00:00:49,701
Cancel my dinner and set up a
lunch with Jones and his wife

11
00:00:49,745 --> 00:00:54,924
Five star, not four.

12
00:01:10,418 --> 00:01:11,984
Mr.Price, good morning!

13
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:17,947
Yes, I'm in my car now, see you
in a few.

14
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,391
'Morning

15
00:01:27,435 --> 00:01:28,697
Morning Mr.Burk

16
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,283
you look good Gerrard, did you
lose a few?

17
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:32,440
Not since yesterday.

18
00:01:32,483 --> 00:01:36,139
Nicks, Celtics, right behind the
bench 32nd row.

19
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:38,141
Heh, right behind the bench is
row two.

20
00:01:38,185 --> 00:01:40,622
Bring binoculars

21
00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:43,015
and if Ashley shows up again
tell her I'm on vacation.

22
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:43,755
Gorgeous redhead?

23
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,148
Gorgeous blonde

24
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:46,584
you're nuts!

25
00:01:46,628 --> 00:01:48,630
Nope, she is.

26
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:54,201
I'm telling you this is one of
the hottest deals I've seen

27
00:01:54,244 --> 00:01:57,769
it is a winner! have I ever
steered you wrong?

28
00:01:57,813 --> 00:02:00,859
Four hundred shares, baby steps
remember?

29
00:02:00,903 --> 00:02:02,359
Oh! and thank you so much for
the juicer,

30
00:02:02,383 --> 00:02:05,473
I'm using it as we speak.

31
00:02:05,516 --> 00:02:08,432
I'm telling you buddy boy, it's you
and me all the way to the end zone.

32
00:02:08,476 --> 00:02:10,478
Huge.

33
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:14,177
Yes, you and me buddy boy, all
the way.

34
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:16,179
Hold my calls Renee!

35
00:02:16,223 --> 00:02:19,182
Mr.Price, is that a new suit?

36
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:20,377
No, but I can see yours is.

37
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:22,490
Thank you for noticing

38
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:25,101
Sit down Harrison.

39
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,321
Oh Sir, you know me, I'm not
much of a sitter.

40
00:02:27,364 --> 00:02:28,757
Can't hit a moving target,
right?

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,195
Sometimes you can.

42
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,809
The Merger didn't go through.

43
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:40,247
You're kidding.

44
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,944
You're not kidding.

45
00:02:41,987 --> 00:02:47,254
We're fielding other offers but
we feel we have to downsize.

46
00:02:47,297 --> 00:02:50,213
Of course, absolutely, we'll
trim the expense account,

47
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:51,214
freeze the club membership, no
problem.

48
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:53,216
Problem.

49
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,045
Not the town car? I love that
car.

50
00:02:56,088 --> 00:03:01,050
The car, the apartment and, it
pains me to say this, your job.

51
00:03:01,093 --> 00:03:05,141
What? I'm your top guy, I'm your
biggest earner.

52
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,075
Well you're also the most
expensive employee in the company,

53
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:09,189
so it's kind of a wash.

54
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:12,496
Listen, before you push the panic
button, it's just temporary.

55
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,370
You know the game, ride the
highs in April, go away in May

56
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:17,413
It's June.

57
00:03:18,981 --> 00:03:20,959
And you're gonna be right back where
you belong by the end of summer.

58
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:22,550
Take a vacation,

59
00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:24,528
spend some of that Commission
money we've been paying you.

60
00:03:24,552 --> 00:03:28,295
And, by the way I'm going to need
you to vacate that apartment A.S.A.P,

61
00:03:28,338 --> 00:03:32,560
we've leased it out to the
London office.

62
00:03:32,603 --> 00:03:35,345
Harrison, I hate to do this to
you, you're like a son to me.

63
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:38,696
Then don't do this... dad.

64
00:03:40,307 --> 00:03:46,269
I've got to get this. I'll get
H.R. to help pack you up.

65
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:49,272
Georgie boy! what are you like
out on the first tee?

66
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:50,926
Okay pal, I'm on my way.

67
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:54,234
Yeah, I'll be there in like an
hour.

68
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:01,502
Colin, Colin! it's Harrison Burk,
I'm thinking about moving sideways

69
00:04:01,545 --> 00:04:05,462
call me.

70
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:08,770
Mr. Hinds! Harrison Burk, we met
last month at the country club,

71
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:13,340
turns out, I am availablethe
position has been filled

72
00:04:13,383 --> 00:04:20,477
watch that backswing buddy,
alright.

73
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:22,871
Listen, I understand that you're
his assistant,

74
00:04:22,914 --> 00:04:26,266
but he was practically begging me
to join his company last month.

75
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:29,530
You know what? Forget it, thank
you!

76
00:04:29,573 --> 00:04:31,793
Jonathan, hey, it's me, your
brother.

77
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:36,841
So I was just wondering if I
could crash on your couch

78
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:42,020
both kids are sick, wow. Okay
I'll just head to a hotel.

79
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:43,674
Give Bonnie and the rugrats a hr
me.

80
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:44,980
Alright.

81
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:22,077
Hey mom.

82
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,038
Harry! oh! oh my stars.

83
00:06:27,082 --> 00:06:31,652
Ben! Ben, it's Harry!

84
00:06:31,695 --> 00:06:34,872
Well well, look who's here.

85
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,614
Hiya Harry, what is it Christmas
already?

86
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:39,834
No dad, and it's Harrison.

87
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:41,183
You're still on that kick are
ya?

88
00:06:41,226 --> 00:06:43,446
It's not a kick, it's my name.

89
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,798
Well as I recall, we named you
Harry after my father.

90
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:49,887
Harrison's better for business.

91
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:52,194
Never hurt my father's business.

92
00:06:52,237 --> 00:06:53,543
He was a mechanic.

93
00:06:53,587 --> 00:06:57,068
Honey, we're thrilled to see
you, aren't we Ben?

94
00:06:57,112 --> 00:07:00,811
Yeah, yeah, thrilled. are you
staying at the hotel again?

95
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:02,485
Actually I thought I'd stay here
for a couple days,

96
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:03,640
maybe a week.

97
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:06,469
Is everything alright? are you
sick?

98
00:07:06,513 --> 00:07:10,952
I just have a little overdue vacation
time, thought I'd spend it with you guys.

99
00:07:10,995 --> 00:07:12,016
But you always go to St.Burts

100
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,693
St. Barts

101
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:13,868
St. Barts

102
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:16,392
You'd tell us if you were sick
right?

103
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,654
The boy says he's not sick.

104
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:20,048
The truth is I am sick,
homesick.

105
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:25,662
Homesick for both of you.

106
00:07:25,706 --> 00:07:29,318
Let's get you settled.

107
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:36,934
What happened to my room?

108
00:07:36,978 --> 00:07:38,066
Well, your brother...

109
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:39,720
The one that gave us the
grandkids.

110
00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:41,504
The girls just spend do much
time here

111
00:07:41,548 --> 00:07:43,550
we wanted to give them a home
away from home.

112
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:46,466
So we packed up your stuff and
we stuck it in the closet.

113
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:49,227
Oh, except I think the girls took it
out and made a little castle with it.

114
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:50,402
Oh they did! will you look at
that.

115
00:07:50,426 --> 00:07:51,035
Isn't it cute?

116
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,472
Nice.

117
00:07:52,515 --> 00:07:53,734
So where do I sleep?

118
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:55,518
You can use Sophia's bed, she
won't mind.

119
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:56,171
Oh really?

120
00:07:56,214 --> 00:07:58,478
We'll tell her.

121
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:01,524
Perfect.

122
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:05,310
Aw, Susie Barns, such a lovely
girl.

123
00:08:05,354 --> 00:08:06,790
Yeah.

124
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:08,072
You know she took over the old
gallery on Oak Street?

125
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:09,595
I haven't talked to her in eight
years.

126
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:11,186
I'm sure she'd love to see you.

127
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:13,101
I highly doubt that.

128
00:08:13,144 --> 00:08:16,147
What's happening son? any
special ladies?

129
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:18,323
No.

130
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:20,674
Just playing the field are you?

131
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:22,719
I like to keep my options open.

132
00:08:22,763 --> 00:08:25,635
I never understood why you broke
up with Susie.

133
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:28,464
We were in high school mom.

134
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,163
But you were so much in love, I always
thought you two would end up together.

135
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:35,340
You also thought I'd be an Astronaut
and President of the United States.

136
00:08:35,384 --> 00:08:39,910
No I didn't, that's just something parents
say to make their kids feel special.

137
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:41,433
Right Ben?

138
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:43,629
I don't recall saying he was
Presidential material, no.

139
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:47,744
Well I'm glad we cleared that
up, I'll withdraw my nomination.

140
00:08:47,788 --> 00:08:50,921
You know, if you'd just stayed here
like I said with the ice-cream business

141
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:53,054
who knows where we could have
taken this.

142
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:55,926
Look at Ben&amp;Jerry, we would be
Ben&amp;Harry.

143
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,862
You guys, please excuse me for a minute
I've got some phone calls to make.

144
00:08:58,886 --> 00:09:01,976
You have to go out in the back yard,
we don't get reception in the house,

145
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:03,257
you have to go out by the swing
set.

146
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:05,457
Swing set?

147
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:09,897
Grandkids. come on honey.

148
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:16,904
Hey, Mr.Price, it's Harrison,
just checking in. Any news?

149
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:21,691
No, not yet, enjoy your vacation.
Where did you settle on?

150
00:09:21,735 --> 00:09:23,867
Uh, St. Barts.

151
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:26,478
Harry, should I pack your
suitcase?

152
00:09:26,522 --> 00:09:31,353
Same old Harrison, blonde or
redhead?

153
00:09:31,396 --> 00:09:33,007
Redhead.

154
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,202
I've got something new for you
tonight, you're gonna love it.

155
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:36,358
Lucky man.

156
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:42,886
Gotta go!

157
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,019
Hey, I got you guys a little
something.

158
00:09:45,062 --> 00:09:48,544
Oh honey we don't need more
presents.

159
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,719
Sure you do

160
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:51,547
Open 'em.

161
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,417
Okay. oh!

162
00:09:52,461 --> 00:09:53,157
You alright?

163
00:09:53,201 --> 00:09:57,074
Yeah, it's heavy.

164
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:59,120
A juicer, just what we need

165
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:01,731
Open yours dad.

166
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:05,430
Oh you didn't have to do that.

167
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:07,998
What's in here?

168
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:14,831
You know what it is? A shirt and
a tie, and a price tag.

169
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:19,923
You know for this kind of money I could
have bought myself a pretty nice T.V.

170
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:24,275
Okay, well I can wear it to
church, maybe even my own funeral.

171
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:27,148
At least you'll go out in style.

172
00:10:27,191 --> 00:10:31,239
I hope everybody's hungry, sit
down boys!

173
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:41,771
Here we go.

174
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:43,512
Why is everything on a stick?

175
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:45,688
That's your mother's new thing.

176
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:50,911
It's fun, and you don't need
utensils.

177
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:52,477
Dinner on a stick.

178
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:55,350
Oh not just dinner, everything.

179
00:10:55,393 --> 00:10:58,788
Name me one food that isn't
better on a stick.

180
00:10:58,832 --> 00:11:01,965
Soup.

181
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:05,534
Don't go giving her ideas.

182
00:11:05,577 --> 00:11:06,970
It's good.

183
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:09,451
Maybe after dinner we could all
watch a nice movie.

184
00:11:09,494 --> 00:11:11,671
Dad'll put something on the VCR.

185
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:14,325
What happened to the Blu-Ray I
sent you?

186
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:16,719
I didn't get a chance to hook
that thing up yet.

187
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:18,547
It's put away.

188
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,768
Actually I don't know, tonight I
got a couple hours work I gotta do.

189
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:23,813
So maybe we do movie night
another night.

190
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:41,657
Hey.

191
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:47,750
Could you pass me the channel
locks?

192
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:53,060
Blue handles.

193
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:54,714
Forgot everything I taught you

194
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:58,587
Not everything. I remember my
old route.

195
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,417
You were one of my best drivers.
You should have stuck with that.

196
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,334
Yeah, think where I could have
been now, the ice-cream king.

197
00:12:06,377 --> 00:12:07,683
There's worse things.

198
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:13,733
There are better things.

199
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:16,431
So how's biz?

200
00:12:16,474 --> 00:12:21,175
Well, you know, summer's staring
school's out, the pools open

201
00:12:21,218 --> 00:12:24,439
it's gonna be huge.

202
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:26,310
How many drivers do you have
now?

203
00:12:26,354 --> 00:12:29,270
Well, not quite as many as when
you were last here with us.

204
00:12:29,313 --> 00:12:32,186
Oh, did you see the new menu?

205
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:34,710
Ah, chocolate bomb pop, sweet.

206
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,758
Yup, that's a big one, that's a
big seller there.

207
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:40,672
When's the last time you raised
prices?

208
00:12:40,716 --> 00:12:44,415
It's a small town, people want
value.

209
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,635
Doesn't mean you have to give it
away.

210
00:12:46,678 --> 00:12:51,683
Get me the hammer will you?

211
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:54,861
That's the one with the wooden
handle.

212
00:12:54,904 --> 00:12:57,037
I know what a hammer is.

213
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,080
Just checkin'.

214
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:33,160
Morning mom, coffee?

215
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:35,771
Decaf, caffeine keeps us awake.

216
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,948
It's daytime, you're supposed to
be awake.

217
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:40,602
Where's the new coffee maker I
sent you?

218
00:13:40,645 --> 00:13:42,473
We're waiting for this one to
break.

219
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:44,780
You can pick up some real coffee
at the market.

220
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,627
And while you're there can you
pick up some oranges?

221
00:13:46,651 --> 00:13:49,872
And antacids for your father,
there's a list.

222
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,091
Do I have to?

223
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:52,527
Did you make your bed?

224
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,223
No.

225
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:55,269
Then you have to.

226
00:13:55,312 --> 00:13:57,227
Gotta make a move.

227
00:13:57,271 --> 00:13:59,142
I see you've got your funeral
clothes on.

228
00:13:59,186 --> 00:14:03,364
We're off to church, Reverend
would be thrilled to see you.

229
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:04,626
Some other time.

230
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:05,583
And when was the last time?

231
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:06,889
I've got calls to make.

232
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:08,369
It's Sunday.

233
00:14:08,412 --> 00:14:09,718
Not in Tokyo.

234
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:12,025
Oh, you're doing business with
the Japanese!

235
00:14:12,068 --> 00:14:13,983
Ohio, that means hello.

236
00:14:14,027 --> 00:14:16,333
And sayonara, that means
goodbye,

237
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:18,248
you wanna be late for the
sermon?

238
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:21,251
I left you some breakfast in the
oven, most important meal of the day.

239
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:22,252
C'mon.

240
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:23,297
Alright!

241
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:24,994
Bye son.

242
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:41,793
Carl my man! just checking on a
rumour.

243
00:14:41,837 --> 00:14:44,274
Iris said there was an opening
at Meryl?

244
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:47,321
Oh you took it, congrats.

245
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:54,718
Reverend: Nice boots

246
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:56,025
Wonderful sermon Reverend

247
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:57,461
Oh, thank you Marla,

248
00:14:57,505 --> 00:15:00,595
you know I gave up my Gin night
to fine tune it,

249
00:15:00,638 --> 00:15:03,380
I really like the way I took the
verses from the Corinthians,

250
00:15:03,424 --> 00:15:05,426
and I contrasted them with the
vers

251
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:06,818
Harrison's home

252
00:15:06,862 --> 00:15:07,776
Harry

253
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:08,951
You're kidding

254
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:10,561
It's an, uh, unexpected visit.

255
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:12,955
How wonderful, the prodigal son
returns.

256
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:16,393
We're worried about him, I think
he took the bus.

257
00:15:16,437 --> 00:15:18,091
Maybe we can get him to come to
church

258
00:15:18,134 --> 00:15:19,919
That's a good one.

259
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:20,789
We tried.

260
00:15:20,832 --> 00:15:22,704
I'm sure it's nothing,

261
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:25,925
after all I have four children and
I never stop worrying about them.

262
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:28,144
Of course they come to church.

263
00:15:28,188 --> 00:15:31,234
I can keep an eye on them at
least once a week.

264
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:32,540
I'll watch out for Harry.

265
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,497
Thank you Reverend.

266
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,673
Okay.

267
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:38,328
Hey! no running, stop that!

268
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:40,504
This church can't afford another
lawsuit.

269
00:15:40,548 --> 00:15:42,724
Just get in there and tie
yourself to the pew.

270
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:24,635
Susie!

271
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:25,679
Susie: Harry?

272
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:38,345
You okay?

273
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:39,955
This isn't my stuff.

274
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,740
Oh no? not even the
marshmallows?

275
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:44,307
Okay, maybe those.

276
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:46,570
Last time you were here you had
a car and a driver.

277
00:16:46,614 --> 00:16:48,050
Well I've gone green.

278
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:50,574
Yeah, and black and blue.

279
00:16:50,618 --> 00:16:52,359
Well it's your fault you know.

280
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:54,206
If you weren't so good looking I
wouldn't have fallen.

281
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,667
Oh, haven't lost that charm.

282
00:16:56,711 --> 00:17:00,671
Nah, just my dignity.

283
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:02,151
I'm glad you're here Harry.

284
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:03,413
Really?

285
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:05,894
Yeah, your mom's been worried
about you.

286
00:17:05,937 --> 00:17:08,070
Oh. Wait, why?

287
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:10,507
She says you're alone.

288
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:13,510
I'm not alone, I've got people
around me all the time.

289
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:18,080
Well, she says you're having
trouble meeting a nice girl.

290
00:17:18,124 --> 00:17:19,188
You having fun embarrassing me?

291
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:22,650
Kind of.

292
00:17:22,693 --> 00:17:24,869
Well, sincere we're talking
about my mom,

293
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:26,784
which I wish we weren't,

294
00:17:26,828 --> 00:17:29,439
she said you took over the
gallery. That's great.

295
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:31,180
Yeah, Thanks.

296
00:17:31,224 --> 00:17:32,834
I'd love to see some of your new
work.

297
00:17:32,877 --> 00:17:36,272
Oh you mean the paintings of
the, oh how did you put it?

298
00:17:36,316 --> 00:17:39,841
The culturally barren wasteland
you call New Hampshire?

299
00:17:39,884 --> 00:17:40,450
Did I say that?

300
00:17:40,494 --> 00:17:42,887
And worse.

301
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:46,108
You kind of have a way with
words.

302
00:17:46,152 --> 00:17:47,849
I was young and stupid.

303
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:50,025
I can see things much clearer
now in my old age.

304
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,724
Yeah, the "no glasses" look is
really good on you.

305
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:56,858
We should grab some lunch or
dinner sometime.

306
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:59,774
How Long are you in town for
this time? An hour?

307
00:17:59,817 --> 00:18:02,603
A little longer than that.

308
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:05,127
Maybe there's a high school
dance we can crash.

309
00:18:05,171 --> 00:18:07,042
I don't think so.

310
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,218
Oh, I guess I have lost my
charm.

311
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:14,963
You haven't lost it, it just
doesn't work on me anymore.

312
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:18,575
Well here, you can throw this at
an old picture of me.

313
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:20,621
I tore all those up.

314
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:22,405
All of them?

315
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:24,494
Take care Harry.

316
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:26,714
It's Harrison.

317
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,893
Judge, Jury, Executioner, !

318
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:34,591
Ah run to the left

319
00:18:34,635 --> 00:18:36,898
Ah! Revenge is mine!

320
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:40,641
I am your master!

321
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:42,730
He's regressed back into being a
teenager.

322
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:45,907
We should have done this weeks
ago.

323
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,257
You live in my house you play by
my rules.

324
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:49,650
Laundry piled everywhere.

325
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,130
Harry!

326
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:52,827
One sec, I'm in the pass of
doom!

327
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,873
So are we!

328
00:18:55,917 --> 00:18:56,874
Excuse me.

329
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:59,529
No! now I'm back to level Five.

330
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:03,229
You've been here for eighteen
days now.

331
00:19:03,272 --> 00:19:04,491
That's all?

332
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:06,033
Well time goes slow when you're
a child.

333
00:19:06,057 --> 00:19:09,539
This isn't a visit home is it?

334
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:14,327
It's an extended visit.

335
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,328
Alright.

336
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:17,895
I was laid off, temporarily.

337
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:20,071
I'm just waiting for word from
the firm.

338
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:21,638
So you're living here.

339
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:23,249
I wouldn't call it living.

340
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:26,382
What about your apartment, your
car, your savings?

341
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:29,690
Gone, gone, and what savings?

342
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:32,388
I don't understand, you make so
much money.

343
00:19:32,432 --> 00:19:35,565
It's New York, Dinners, clothes,
vacations.

344
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:38,046
If you wanna be successful, you
have to look successful.

345
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:40,222
Haven't we taught you anything?

346
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:42,398
This is Wall st. dad, not Main
st.

347
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:44,357
Oh, okay.

348
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,363
Well this is the key to the truck
that sells ice-cream down on Main st.

349
00:19:50,406 --> 00:19:55,716
If you're gonna be living here,
you're gonna be jingling that bell.

350
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:56,847
Not the paper hat.

351
00:19:56,891 --> 00:20:00,199
Yes the paper hat.

352
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:02,636
Welcome home son.

353
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,905
Turn that machine off.

354
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:28,009
Where's the fleet?

355
00:20:28,052 --> 00:20:30,141
Well, you're looking at it.

356
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:31,708
A truck and a bike.

357
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:34,058
Well all the other trucks are
getting kind of run down so,

358
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:35,799
gas is expensive.

359
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:38,759
I ordered some new ones but
apparently they've backordered so

360
00:20:38,802 --> 00:20:40,040
You can't run the summer on a
truck and a bike.

361
00:20:40,064 --> 00:20:44,547
Yeah I can.

362
00:20:44,591 --> 00:20:45,287
Wow.

363
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:46,375
Yeah?

364
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:47,202
I love what you've done with the
place.

365
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,421
Well, it's functional.

366
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:50,336
So's an interrogation room.

367
00:20:54,122 --> 00:20:55,732
I was just remembering

368
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:58,648
how I used to pick you up from
school in an ice-cream truck,

369
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:01,085
how you'd love that.

370
00:21:01,129 --> 00:21:04,219
No one wants to be picked up in
an ice-cream truck dad.

371
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,396
I guess, except people who love
ice-cream.

372
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,745
What are you drinking?

373
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:10,181
Hot water and lemon.

374
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:11,487
Why?

375
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:13,359
Why? Because your mother saw
something on T.V.

376
00:21:13,402 --> 00:21:15,032
that said caffeine's not that
good for you.

377
00:21:15,056 --> 00:21:18,886
So now it's hot water and lemon.

378
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:21,323
Dry Ice first, ice-cream last.

379
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:23,412
I know dad,

380
00:21:23,456 --> 00:21:25,806
'Atta boy.

381
00:21:31,115 --> 00:21:38,906
Close the door, you're letting
the cold air out!

382
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:43,258
Hey, Mr. Price

383
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,041
Hey buddy boy

384
00:21:44,085 --> 00:21:45,478
Any news on the merger?

385
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:50,657
No, no, not yet, what are you
still in St. Barts?

386
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,877
Hey, service is terrible can I
call you back in one minute?

387
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:57,577
Alright, ok you've got a minute.

388
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,714
Hey, I'm having a having a hard
time hearing you.

389
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:10,633
Mr. Price, Mr. Price?

390
00:22:10,677 --> 00:22:12,243
Hello?

391
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:15,986
Cell phone reception is terrible
in the Caribbean, so listen.

392
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:19,686
Say hi to Becky at Le Tai for me
okay buddy?

393
00:22:19,729 --> 00:22:23,211
Look you're not missing anything
here, the weather's brutal.

394
00:22:23,254 --> 00:22:24,734
Have fun.

395
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:36,485
Oh, here you go, new extension
cord.

396
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:38,182
The upgrades keep coming.

397
00:22:38,226 --> 00:22:40,010
And don't forget to plug in

398
00:22:40,054 --> 00:22:44,101
'cause that dry goes and just
melts on you in this weather right?

399
00:22:44,145 --> 00:22:45,731
I'm assuming the new trucks will
have generators?

400
00:22:45,755 --> 00:22:48,149
Yeah.

401
00:22:48,192 --> 00:22:49,759
Here's your co-worker, Razor.

402
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:50,847
You're late.

403
00:22:50,891 --> 00:22:53,023
Sorry Mr.B I had homework.

404
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:55,635
It's summer.

405
00:22:55,678 --> 00:22:56,505
Summer school.

406
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:58,855
No.

407
00:22:58,899 --> 00:22:59,682
Who's he?

408
00:22:59,726 --> 00:23:00,553
I was you once.

409
00:23:00,596 --> 00:23:02,772
He's my kid, Harry.

410
00:23:02,816 --> 00:23:05,079
Kid? He's like a hundred.

411
00:23:05,122 --> 00:23:07,298
Thanks, and you're not in summer
school

412
00:23:07,342 --> 00:23:09,581
you overslept because you were with
your friends all night at the river.

413
00:23:09,605 --> 00:23:12,521
Oh yeah, look at your shoes.

414
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:16,090
Okay, alright alright, alright,
you got me okay, busted.

415
00:23:16,133 --> 00:23:18,024
Alright I'm taking the A route,
you take the B route.

416
00:23:18,048 --> 00:23:19,852
Woah, woah woah, hey hey, no, no
I got the A route wired.

417
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:22,226
Of course you do. The pool's on
the A route,

418
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,490
Stop for a swim, girls in
bikinis,

419
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:27,101
Maybe trade a few ice-creams for
a tavern burger?

420
00:23:27,144 --> 00:23:30,757
You got the bike, he's got the
truck, have a nice day.

421
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,933
Oh come on Mr.B, look at him
I've got seniority.

422
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:34,413
Actually I do,

423
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:38,417
I've been here since '98 when
you were in diapers.

424
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:44,945
Harsh.

425
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:52,692
Hey! Put on your hat.

426
00:23:52,735 --> 00:23:54,171
Put on yours.

427
00:24:10,884 --> 00:24:15,628
Nice negotiating, that business
degree is really paying off huh?

428
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:17,891
That's who's representing you on
the streets?

429
00:24:17,934 --> 00:24:20,589
We're selling ice-cream, not
mutual funds.

430
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:22,112
Does he even have a drivers
licence?

431
00:24:22,156 --> 00:24:23,766
As far as I know,

432
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,614
I don't think you need one for
riding around town on a bicycle.

433
00:24:25,638 --> 00:24:29,555
C'mon let's get going. And don't
be stopping for a swim right?

434
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:31,165
We got a lot of inventory to
move today.

435
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:33,994
Come on.

436
00:24:50,663 --> 00:24:53,361
Yes can you please just tell him
that Harrison Burk called again?

437
00:24:53,404 --> 00:24:55,406
Thank you.

438
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,234
Brightaw! What's going on man?

439
00:24:57,278 --> 00:24:59,541
Any openings at Barish Sterns?

440
00:24:59,585 --> 00:25:01,804
Okay I understand.

441
00:25:01,848 --> 00:25:06,287
Grits, any news on that opening at the G.S.
Account? Call me back.

442
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:10,421
Marty, Marty, Marty, love you
baby, whadda ya got for me?

443
00:25:10,465 --> 00:25:17,124
Okay well just please let me
know if anything comes along.

444
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:19,692
Yeah, uh I'd like to leave a
message.

445
00:25:19,735 --> 00:25:21,868
Harrison Burk.

446
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:24,392
Yeah I believe they have my
number.

447
00:25:24,435 --> 00:25:26,394
Okay thank you so much.

448
00:25:26,437 --> 00:25:28,546
Hey buddy, wanna sweeten your
day with some ice-cream?

449
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,747
The lord sweetens my day. Hello
Harry.

450
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:32,792
Hey Reverend.

451
00:25:32,835 --> 00:25:33,706
I'm sorry I didn't recognize
you.

452
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:35,969
Maybe if you came to church.

453
00:25:36,012 --> 00:25:37,579
Yeah I've been a little
preoccupied.

454
00:25:37,623 --> 00:25:39,059
Mhmm.

455
00:25:39,102 --> 00:25:42,845
Your mother's been worried about
you. Did you take a bus?

456
00:25:42,889 --> 00:25:45,500
Mothers, can't live with 'em,
can't live without 'em, right?

457
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,739
Seeing as how you're living with
your mother at the present moment

458
00:25:47,763 --> 00:25:50,505
I'm not sure that's an accurate
assessment.

459
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,595
I'll have an ice-cream sandwich.

460
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:58,034
Good choice.

461
00:25:58,078 --> 00:25:59,079
Thank you

462
00:25:59,122 --> 00:26:01,124
Uh, that's a dollar fifty.

463
00:26:01,168 --> 00:26:03,605
Your dad charges me a dollar.

464
00:26:03,649 --> 00:26:05,172
Of course he does.

465
00:26:05,215 --> 00:26:08,175
You know Harry, faith is the
first step,

466
00:26:08,218 --> 00:26:11,787
even when you can't see the
staircase.

467
00:26:11,831 --> 00:26:13,354
What does that mean?

468
00:26:13,397 --> 00:26:15,617
I have no idea, but when you
figure it out, you tell me.

469
00:26:15,661 --> 00:26:17,837
'Cause I'm dying to know.

470
00:27:02,142 --> 00:27:05,188
Waffles on a stick.

471
00:27:05,232 --> 00:27:07,408
My phone's broken.

472
00:27:07,451 --> 00:27:09,410
Did I do that?

473
00:27:09,453 --> 00:27:12,369
No, It's my fault. It was in my
pocket.

474
00:27:12,413 --> 00:27:16,983
You can have one of ours, we have
an extra it's still in the box.

475
00:27:17,026 --> 00:27:20,160
No this is my new number, so
just have him call me here.

476
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:22,815
What? No I'm not under water,

477
00:27:22,858 --> 00:27:25,861
I'm in the Caribbean so service
is spotty.

478
00:27:25,905 --> 00:27:31,475
Yeah I'll have two Pina coladas,
thank you.

479
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:33,216
Hey Kids who wants ice-cream?

480
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,436
I'm not supposed to talk to
strangers

481
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:36,829
I'm a stranger I grew up here.

482
00:27:38,047 --> 00:27:39,938
If you grew up then why are you
wearing a paper hat?

483
00:27:39,962 --> 00:27:41,529
You want ice-cream or not?

484
00:27:41,572 --> 00:27:43,662
I'm lactose intolerant.

485
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:47,578
That's over diagnosed. How about
you guys, you want some ice-cream?

486
00:27:47,622 --> 00:27:49,145
Does it have gluten?

487
00:27:49,189 --> 00:27:51,080
What is this, a playground or a
weight watchers meeting?

488
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:53,193
It's a church.

489
00:27:53,236 --> 00:27:55,761
Are you hustling my kids for
ice-cream money?

490
00:27:55,804 --> 00:27:58,024
No. Wait, you have kids?

491
00:27:58,067 --> 00:27:59,547
I teach Sunday school.

492
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,853
It's Saturday.

493
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:03,420
Nope, it's Sunday.

494
00:28:03,464 --> 00:28:06,641
What's going on Harry?

495
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:11,907
Well, I'm kind of living with my
parents again, temporarily,

496
00:28:11,951 --> 00:28:16,825
and selling ice-cream. It's kind
of a sticky situation.

497
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:18,044
Oh, I'm sorry.

498
00:28:18,087 --> 00:28:19,959
On the plus side I got the A
route.

499
00:28:20,002 --> 00:28:21,874
Oh.

500
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:26,182
Hey! Those are my customers.

501
00:28:26,226 --> 00:28:27,749
Not any more.

502
00:28:27,793 --> 00:28:29,403
No poaching.

503
00:28:29,446 --> 00:28:31,231
This is open turf.

504
00:28:31,274 --> 00:28:32,145
Since when?

505
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:33,407
Ask your dad.

506
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,582
Ask your dad!

507
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:36,627
You know what? Maybe I will.

508
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:38,934
And guess what? He's a lot
bigger than yours.

509
00:28:38,978 --> 00:28:41,197
Bring your whole family.

510
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:43,330
It's good to see you're all
grown up.

511
00:28:43,373 --> 00:28:44,679
C'mon Kids.

512
00:28:58,084 --> 00:29:01,783
Hey, a little bird told me, your
mother,

513
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:05,787
that you, what did you run into
Susie again?

514
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:07,615
I'd rather not talk about it.

515
00:29:07,658 --> 00:29:11,793
You know, I've always thought
that love is a lot like ice-cream.

516
00:29:11,837 --> 00:29:13,142
Dad please.

517
00:29:13,186 --> 00:29:15,405
There are a lot of flavours out
there right?

518
00:29:15,449 --> 00:29:20,193
And then you find one that you
love and you stick with it.

519
00:29:20,236 --> 00:29:21,542
How poignant.

520
00:29:21,585 --> 00:29:23,587
Thank you.

521
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:28,133
Oh, this is very important, this is gonna
go to the seniors' centre, no charge.

522
00:29:28,157 --> 00:29:29,202
No charge?

523
00:29:29,245 --> 00:29:31,682
No charge, it's their bingo
night.

524
00:29:31,726 --> 00:29:34,207
So they're winning money at
bingo while you're losing it.

525
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,687
Everything's not about making
money son.

526
00:29:36,731 --> 00:29:40,256
Yes you made that crystal clear.

527
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,345
You're giving away pistachio?
That's a big seller!

528
00:29:42,389 --> 00:29:45,000
Oh, they love pistachio, it
means a lot to them.

529
00:29:45,044 --> 00:29:46,978
That's nice, and when are those
new trucks coming in?

530
00:29:47,002 --> 00:29:48,003
Just in time for winter?

531
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:50,963
Yeah any day now I think.

532
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:53,768
You know if you tried to make an actual
profit you wouldn't be stuck here?

533
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,271
Stuck?

534
00:29:55,315 --> 00:29:57,708
In this town, in this life.

535
00:29:57,752 --> 00:30:00,929
Well I like it here, I like this
town, I like this life.

536
00:30:00,973 --> 00:30:04,063
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it that
way, I just want you to be..

537
00:30:04,106 --> 00:30:07,544
What? Someone else.

538
00:30:07,588 --> 00:30:10,504
No, it's just, ice-cream?

539
00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:11,742
You could be so much more dad.

540
00:30:11,766 --> 00:30:14,769
You know, you may not believe
this son,

541
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,294
this may not be the sexiest job,
and it sure doesn't pay the best,

542
00:30:18,338 --> 00:30:23,604
but living here and with your mother
in this town, I'm actually happy.

543
00:30:23,647 --> 00:30:24,910
Here you go.

544
00:30:24,953 --> 00:30:26,041
You could be happier.

545
00:30:26,085 --> 00:30:28,739
Well who couldn't?

546
00:30:28,783 --> 00:30:30,872
So don't forget about the
seniors eh?

547
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,482
That's no charge,

548
00:30:32,526 --> 00:30:35,964
those people are on a fixed
income they'll get very upset.

549
00:30:36,008 --> 00:30:37,009
Have a nice afternoon

550
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:07,561
You're new huh?

551
00:31:07,604 --> 00:31:09,258
Sort of.

552
00:31:09,302 --> 00:31:12,305
Don't tell me, you're Ben's kid?

553
00:31:12,348 --> 00:31:13,436
Pretty much.

554
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,136
I pictured somebody a little
taller.

555
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:21,314
Hey look, we need a fourth for
lawn bowling are you any good?

556
00:31:21,357 --> 00:31:24,186
Probably not.

557
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,753
What have you got here?

558
00:31:25,796 --> 00:31:28,669
It's all vanilla there's no
pistachio in here at all.

559
00:31:28,712 --> 00:31:30,323
Fresh out.

560
00:31:30,366 --> 00:31:37,243
That's okay, tell your dad
thanks from me and the gang huh?

561
00:31:37,286 --> 00:31:41,203
You're a pretty grumpy guy for
an ice-cream man.

562
00:31:41,247 --> 00:31:43,466
You should smile more you know
that?

563
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,686
It won't melt the ice-cream.

564
00:32:19,024 --> 00:32:21,243
What are you doing?

565
00:32:21,287 --> 00:32:25,682
I'm serenading you.

566
00:32:25,726 --> 00:32:27,162
The house looks nice,

567
00:32:27,206 --> 00:32:29,338
I see you've still got that
squeaky old porch swing.

568
00:32:29,382 --> 00:32:30,687
Yup.

569
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:33,429
If this is your ice-cream pitch
it needs work.

570
00:32:33,473 --> 00:32:35,277
Does your dad know you're
ruining his business?

571
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:37,172
Yes.

572
00:32:37,216 --> 00:32:39,000
What do you want Harry?

573
00:32:39,044 --> 00:32:41,152
I was kinda hoping you'd hop in
and ride the old route with me.

574
00:32:41,176 --> 00:32:42,917
Like the old days.

575
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,050
It's tempting, but I'm gonna
have to say no.

576
00:32:45,093 --> 00:32:46,660
Aw, c'mon I got the A route.

577
00:32:46,703 --> 00:32:48,836
We could stop by the pool, I'll
let you ring the bell.

578
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:51,447
Do you use the tactics on Wall
St.?

579
00:32:51,491 --> 00:32:52,535
Yes.

580
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:53,754
Do they work?

581
00:32:53,797 --> 00:32:55,060
Usually.

582
00:32:55,103 --> 00:32:58,498
Well, I guess they don't know
you like I do.

583
00:32:58,541 --> 00:33:01,762
Actually no one knows me like
you do.

584
00:33:05,157 --> 00:33:06,897
Is that Rick Johnson?

585
00:33:06,941 --> 00:33:08,421
Yep.

586
00:33:08,464 --> 00:33:10,379
Tennis partner?

587
00:33:10,423 --> 00:33:12,947
Not exactly.

588
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,818
Please tell me you're not going
out with him.

589
00:33:14,862 --> 00:33:15,732
He's grown up, we all have.

590
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:19,084
Well most of us.

591
00:33:19,127 --> 00:33:19,649
Hey.

592
00:33:19,693 --> 00:33:22,043
Hi.

593
00:33:22,087 --> 00:33:25,177
Burk! I heard you were back.

594
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,005
Yup in all my glory.

595
00:33:27,048 --> 00:33:29,355
Oh yeah, nice wheels.

596
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:33,446
Yeah, you too, finally got that
sports car huh?

597
00:33:33,489 --> 00:33:36,492
Well, you've been gone a while,
that's my third one.

598
00:33:36,536 --> 00:33:38,494
You a used car salesman?

599
00:33:38,538 --> 00:33:39,626
Lawyer.

600
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:40,931
Same thing.

601
00:33:40,975 --> 00:33:43,151
That's funny coming from an
ice-cream guy.

602
00:33:43,195 --> 00:33:45,197
Actually we prefer ice-cream
technician.

603
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,633
Do ya?

604
00:33:46,676 --> 00:33:48,983
Rick helped me negotiate the
deal with the Gallery.

605
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,637
She's an amazing artist.

606
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,639
Oh, I know.

607
00:33:52,682 --> 00:33:55,729
Shouldn't you be off selling
Eskimo pies or something?

608
00:33:55,772 --> 00:33:57,470
No rush, I have all day.

609
00:33:57,513 --> 00:33:59,124
Oh, unfortunately we don't,

610
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:02,910
We've got a match at the club so
ciao.

611
00:34:06,348 --> 00:34:08,089
My lady.

612
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:12,180
Hey wait, I can't let you leave
empty handed.

613
00:34:12,224 --> 00:34:13,094
Your favourite.

614
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:14,791
You remembered.

615
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:16,315
Here councillor, on the house.

616
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:20,928
Oh yeah, ice-cream might stain
the upholstery, so thanks.

617
00:34:20,971 --> 00:34:22,669
Not if it's real leather.

618
00:34:22,712 --> 00:34:26,760
Oh it is.

619
00:34:31,765 --> 00:34:33,680
Later Skater.

620
00:36:00,332 --> 00:36:03,291
I'm sorry, I lost track of time.

621
00:36:03,335 --> 00:36:07,252
That was three hundred dollars
of inventory, you realise that?

622
00:36:07,295 --> 00:36:10,037
You know what? Take this
it's worth five times that.

623
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,256
I don't need your watch,

624
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:14,824
You need the watch, you lost
track of time.

625
00:36:14,868 --> 00:36:17,175
Okay I'll sell it and pay you
for the inventory.

626
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:20,439
It's not about that, this
about responsibility.

627
00:36:20,482 --> 00:36:28,482
Responsibility and character.
I'm disappointed in you son.

628
00:36:29,012 --> 00:36:31,014
Tell him I'll make it up to him.

629
00:36:31,058 --> 00:36:33,800
Go to your room Harry.

630
00:36:53,036 --> 00:36:57,258
You need to fix that mobile,
Pluto's no longer a planet.

631
00:36:57,302 --> 00:36:59,478
We're going to the Reverend's
for dinner,

632
00:36:59,521 --> 00:37:01,871
If you go out, turn out the
lights.

633
00:37:01,915 --> 00:37:03,308
Where am I going to go?

634
00:37:03,351 --> 00:37:06,441
You know what? I think he should
just stay home,

635
00:37:06,485 --> 00:37:07,703
and just think about who he

636
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:09,444
is.

637
00:38:54,201 --> 00:38:56,508
Hi.

638
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:58,031
It's beautiful Susie.

639
00:38:58,074 --> 00:38:59,206
Thanks.

640
00:38:59,249 --> 00:39:00,468
It's for sale.

641
00:39:00,512 --> 00:39:01,643
I'll take it!

642
00:39:01,687 --> 00:39:03,297
Would you trade me for a watch?

643
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,082
No, but I'll trade you for that
doorstop.

644
00:39:06,126 --> 00:39:08,302
Yeah, my new phone, actually my
parents phone,

645
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,784
they shop at a museum so it's
a valuable.

646
00:39:11,827 --> 00:39:13,525
Ah, very vintage.

647
00:39:13,568 --> 00:39:15,788
Yeah, vintage.

648
00:39:15,831 --> 00:39:18,312
So, uh, you and Rick Johnson
huh?

649
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,228
Believe it or not he's actually
a really good guy.

650
00:39:21,271 --> 00:39:22,621
Oh so he's only a jerk around
me.

651
00:39:22,664 --> 00:39:24,666
Well you really bring out the
worst in him.

652
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:28,061
Just tell me it's not serious.

653
00:39:28,104 --> 00:39:34,110
I dunno.

654
00:39:34,154 --> 00:39:39,420
Rick Johnson, I gotta say, I
never saw that coming.

655
00:39:39,464 --> 00:39:42,641
How could you? You've been gone.

656
00:39:42,684 --> 00:39:44,251
Well I'm here now.

657
00:39:44,294 --> 00:39:46,122
Are you?

658
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:48,124
It sure feels like it.

659
00:39:48,168 --> 00:39:51,040
Come on Harry. One call from
Wall St.

660
00:39:51,084 --> 00:39:53,260
And you'll take off without a
glance back.

661
00:39:53,303 --> 00:39:55,871
Just like last time.

662
00:39:55,915 --> 00:39:58,570
I'm sorry, I should have handled
things differently.

663
00:39:58,613 --> 00:40:02,443
I just wanted to leave here so
badly.

664
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:05,011
I noticed.

665
00:40:05,054 --> 00:40:07,405
I screwed up.

666
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:09,755
Was it so awful here?

667
00:40:09,798 --> 00:40:14,455
No, I just, thought I wanted
more.

668
00:40:14,499 --> 00:40:16,283
You got it.

669
00:40:16,326 --> 00:40:20,418
I guess.

670
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:22,115
Well, I should get home.

671
00:40:22,158 --> 00:40:23,377
I'll join you.

672
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,465
Where's your truck?

673
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:32,509
Plugged in, next to my bike.

674
00:40:33,909 --> 00:40:36,956
I forgot how quiet it gets here
at night, I like it.

675
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:39,654
You didn't used to.

676
00:40:39,698 --> 00:40:41,874
Dunno what you've got 'till it's
gone right?

677
00:40:41,917 --> 00:40:43,745
There's that charm.

678
00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:44,790
Still not working?

679
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:46,531
Nope.

680
00:40:46,574 --> 00:40:51,318
How about this? Will you accept
this rose?

681
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:54,539
You do realize that that's the
Fiona Greber's prize rosebush right?

682
00:40:54,582 --> 00:40:56,018
She still lives here?

683
00:40:56,062 --> 00:40:58,020
Yeah.

684
00:40:58,064 --> 00:41:01,415
Is that you Harry Burk
stealing my roses?

685
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,721
It's Rick Johnson.

686
00:41:02,764 --> 00:41:05,288
Oh, you should be so lucky.

687
00:41:05,332 --> 00:41:09,510
I never liked you as kid Harry,
Nothing's changed.

688
00:41:09,554 --> 00:41:16,691
Sorry they'll grow back,
have a nice night.

689
00:41:16,735 --> 00:41:20,129
Personally, I think she's so mean
because she has a big crush on me.

690
00:41:20,173 --> 00:41:21,130
That's always a problem isn't
it?

691
00:41:21,174 --> 00:41:24,830
Always.

692
00:41:24,873 --> 00:41:27,746
Do you remember when we took
your truck down by the river,

693
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:29,922
and all those ducks got in?

694
00:41:29,965 --> 00:41:32,664
Oh yeah, they ate all the
popsicles.

695
00:41:32,707 --> 00:41:35,318
Your dad grounded you for a
month.

696
00:41:35,362 --> 00:41:36,818
Yeah, I think he'll ground me
tonight.

697
00:41:36,842 --> 00:41:38,887
How long this time?

698
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:41,760
'Till my 40th birthday.

699
00:41:41,803 --> 00:41:44,240
Some things never change.

700
00:41:44,284 --> 00:41:48,506
Some things do.

701
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:50,986
Do you think there's any way we
could just,

702
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:54,512
forget about the last eight
years?

703
00:41:54,555 --> 00:41:56,122
No.

704
00:41:56,165 --> 00:41:59,038
Yeah, you're right.

705
00:41:59,081 --> 00:42:01,606
But I suppose we could be
friends.

706
00:42:01,649 --> 00:42:03,782
Ah, the friend zone.

707
00:42:03,825 --> 00:42:08,003
Hey you're lucky to be getting
the friend zone considering.

708
00:42:08,047 --> 00:42:11,616
I'll take what I can get.

709
00:42:15,445 --> 00:42:17,099
Hi.

710
00:42:17,143 --> 00:42:20,625
Hey, you ready?

711
00:42:20,668 --> 00:42:22,017
Sure, where we going?

712
00:42:22,061 --> 00:42:24,063
Ha Ha.

713
00:42:24,106 --> 00:42:26,631
Harry and I were just talking
about old days.

714
00:42:26,674 --> 00:42:29,503
Ah well, you know what they say,

715
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:34,377
The past is history, tomorrow's
a mystery, and today's a present.

716
00:42:34,421 --> 00:42:35,814
Who says that?

717
00:42:35,857 --> 00:42:37,598
Well it definitely wasn't an
ice-cream man.

718
00:42:37,642 --> 00:42:39,078
Maybe a used car salesman?

719
00:42:39,121 --> 00:42:40,383
Lawyer.

720
00:42:40,427 --> 00:42:41,689
So you keep saying.

721
00:42:41,733 --> 00:42:43,256
Would you two stop it?

722
00:42:43,299 --> 00:42:44,518
We can't.

723
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:48,566
Oh no I can, 'cause see, I got
the girl.

724
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:52,352
Oh, and the job, and the car,
awkward.

725
00:42:52,395 --> 00:42:54,180
See? You can't stop.

726
00:42:54,223 --> 00:42:57,226
Revenge is sweet.

727
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:59,141
And a dish best served cold.

728
00:42:59,185 --> 00:43:01,970
So basically revenge is
ice-cream, which reminds me,

729
00:43:02,014 --> 00:43:06,801
it's past my curfew, goodnight
Susie, Rick.

730
00:43:06,845 --> 00:43:10,283
Goodnight Harry, say hi to your
parents for me.

731
00:43:10,326 --> 00:43:15,462
Yeah me too.

732
00:43:18,465 --> 00:43:21,686
Let's face facts here, we're not
getting any younger,

733
00:43:21,729 --> 00:43:24,079
and we both said this was gonna
be our last season.

734
00:43:24,123 --> 00:43:28,867
I was just kinda hoping we'd go
out with a bang and not a thud.

735
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:29,781
We'll get through this.

736
00:43:29,824 --> 00:43:31,826
Of course we will.

737
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:35,569
Get through what?

738
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:39,442
Huh, I thought you were upstairs
in your room.

739
00:43:39,486 --> 00:43:41,531
Where'd you go?

740
00:43:41,575 --> 00:43:43,751
Who cares, what do you mean last
season?

741
00:43:43,795 --> 00:43:45,884
Honey, we didn't want you to
know.

742
00:43:45,927 --> 00:43:47,407
Are you sick?

743
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:48,626
No.

744
00:43:48,669 --> 00:43:50,323
Dad?

745
00:43:50,366 --> 00:43:51,890
I'm shutting it down.

746
00:43:51,933 --> 00:43:54,544
Rocky Road is finished, come
labour day that's it,

747
00:43:54,588 --> 00:43:56,503
we're closing the doors.

748
00:43:56,546 --> 00:43:58,113
What about the new trucks.

749
00:43:58,157 --> 00:44:00,135
There's no new trucks, I can't
compete look you know these,

750
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:03,466
they're opening up ice-cream parlours
and frozen yogurt places everywhere

751
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:04,685
nice places too.

752
00:44:04,729 --> 00:44:06,861
I can't compete.

753
00:44:06,905 --> 00:44:08,689
Why didn't you tell me?

754
00:44:08,733 --> 00:44:11,953
Why didn't you tell me you were
fired?

755
00:44:11,997 --> 00:44:14,129
I dunno, I just

756
00:44:14,173 --> 00:44:16,784
See, same thing.

757
00:44:16,828 --> 00:44:21,223
Actually to tell you the truth I just
didn't want you to see me as a failure.

758
00:44:21,267 --> 00:44:25,488
But now, as things turn out, you
were right all along.

759
00:44:25,532 --> 00:44:28,274
Dad, we can fix this.

760
00:44:28,317 --> 00:44:31,364
It's done, Marla.

761
00:44:31,407 --> 00:44:32,408
'Night Harry.

762
00:45:10,533 --> 00:45:15,234
What's all the racket, what's
all this?

763
00:45:15,277 --> 00:45:17,342
I'm pretty sure it's every
present I've ever given you.

764
00:45:17,366 --> 00:45:21,762
BluRay, flat screen T.V., Wireless
speakers, electric foot massager,

765
00:45:21,806 --> 00:45:26,767
New microwave, electric knives,
Panini Grill,

766
00:45:26,811 --> 00:45:28,595
the Juicer you remember of
course,

767
00:45:28,638 --> 00:45:29,958
and what kitchen would be
complete

768
00:45:29,988 --> 00:45:31,685
without a Japanese rice cooker?

769
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:34,644
How's she gonna get the rice on
those little sticks?

770
00:45:34,688 --> 00:45:36,168
I can try.

771
00:45:36,211 --> 00:45:37,841
Well I thought you should at
least try everything,

772
00:45:37,865 --> 00:45:39,625
whatever you don't want you can
give to the seniors centre.

773
00:45:39,649 --> 00:45:41,869
Arigato, Harry.

774
00:45:41,913 --> 00:45:45,307
You'd better wait until we get
the electric bill.

775
00:45:45,351 --> 00:45:47,222
Fresh squeezed.

776
00:45:47,266 --> 00:45:50,269
Now how many oranges would you have
to use to get a glass this size?

777
00:45:50,312 --> 00:45:53,925
Just try it.

778
00:45:53,968 --> 00:45:56,797
That's amazing, isn't that
great?

779
00:45:56,841 --> 00:45:58,625
You know what someone once told
me?

780
00:45:58,668 --> 00:46:02,672
Life is a lot like ice-cream,
enjoy it before it melts.

781
00:46:02,716 --> 00:46:05,066
I cannot believe that you
remember that.

782
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:06,633
I remember.

783
00:46:06,676 --> 00:46:09,027
Did you remember to get electric
skewers for your mum?

784
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:10,724
I did not.

785
00:46:35,314 --> 00:46:40,536
Welcome everyone, it's good to see
you out on such a beautiful day.

786
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:47,848
I'm seeing a lot of old friends,
a lot of new friends, and Harry Burk.

787
00:46:47,892 --> 00:46:51,852
It's never too late, is it?

788
00:46:51,896 --> 00:46:56,074
It's never too late Harry, but
please, no more interruptions.

789
00:46:56,117 --> 00:46:59,729
The Lord does work in wondrous
ways.

790
00:46:59,773 --> 00:47:05,518
Seeing Harry back with us today is
the perfect lead in to todays sermon,

791
00:47:05,561 --> 00:47:12,699
The Wayward son, God's love is
unwavering even when one is lost.

792
00:47:12,742 --> 00:47:19,314
The Bible says: And not many days
after, the younger son, like Harry,

793
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:26,104
Gathered and took his journey into
a far country, like New York City.

794
00:47:26,147 --> 00:47:32,632
And there, wasted his substance
with riotus living, like town cars,

795
00:47:32,675 --> 00:47:37,376
beautiful penthouse apartments,
and expense accounts.

796
00:47:37,419 --> 00:47:42,163
Now obviously I'm paraphrasing people,
but that's the least of my sins.

797
00:47:42,207 --> 00:47:47,125
What the Bible is saying here,
is that we are all equally wise,

798
00:47:47,168 --> 00:47:55,168
and equally foolish. Let us
pray, Harry.

799
00:47:56,395 --> 00:47:58,329
Why do I feel like that whole
sermon was directed towards me?

800
00:47:58,353 --> 00:48:00,027
Well you should have heard last
week's sermon.

801
00:48:00,051 --> 00:48:04,229
What, that was about me too?

802
00:48:04,272 --> 00:48:05,708
You look nice.

803
00:48:05,752 --> 00:48:07,319
You too.

804
00:48:07,362 --> 00:48:11,105
Thank you, it's the only jacket
my mom hasn't shrunk... yet

805
00:48:11,149 --> 00:48:13,151
You could do your own laundry.

806
00:48:13,194 --> 00:48:14,979
I'm not allowed.

807
00:48:15,022 --> 00:48:16,328
Oh.

808
00:48:16,371 --> 00:48:19,026
8 cylinder of course right?

809
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:19,984
Susie?

810
00:48:20,027 --> 00:48:22,943
Hi!

811
00:48:22,987 --> 00:48:26,860
I just talked to your parents in
Florida, they want you to call more.

812
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,818
Really? I call every day.

813
00:48:28,862 --> 00:48:30,951
Twice a day would be good.

814
00:48:30,995 --> 00:48:33,519
So nice to see you two kids
together again.

815
00:48:33,562 --> 00:48:36,783
We're not together mom, Susie's
with Rick.

816
00:48:36,826 --> 00:48:38,350
Hasn't that blown over yet
honey?

817
00:48:38,393 --> 00:48:39,960
Mom.

818
00:48:40,004 --> 00:48:44,356
Hey, Mrs. Burk, I didn't know
your husband was a car guy.

819
00:48:44,399 --> 00:48:47,707
Actually our first date was in a
'68 Shelby Cobra.

820
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:48,969
Dad had a sports car?

821
00:48:49,013 --> 00:48:51,015
He built it himself in the
garage.

822
00:48:51,058 --> 00:48:52,973
You kids think we were never
your age,

823
00:48:53,017 --> 00:48:55,280
you'd be shocked at some of the
things we did.

824
00:48:55,323 --> 00:48:57,021
Ugh, over sharing mom.

825
00:48:57,064 --> 00:48:58,805
Why don't you two join us for
lunch?

826
00:48:58,848 --> 00:49:00,241
Oh, yeah, we'd love to.

827
00:49:00,285 --> 00:49:03,244
Um, actually we got that thing.

828
00:49:03,288 --> 00:49:04,245
What "Thing"?

829
00:49:04,289 --> 00:49:06,595
It's a work thing, at my firm.

830
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:09,076
It's Sunday, It is Sunday,
right?

831
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,383
Uh, yeah.

832
00:49:11,426 --> 00:49:14,734
Look, I didn't want to do this
here.

833
00:49:14,777 --> 00:49:17,171
Is this about Dallas?

834
00:49:17,215 --> 00:49:18,912
How do you know about Dallas?

835
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,566
Your mother talks to her
hairdresser,

836
00:49:20,609 --> 00:49:22,152
her hairdresser talks to Fiona's
sister,

837
00:49:22,176 --> 00:49:26,485
Fiona's sister told Fiona,
and Fiona told me at Sushi Clas.

838
00:49:26,528 --> 00:49:28,878
What's in Dallas?

839
00:49:28,922 --> 00:49:32,708
Me, and I hope you too.

840
00:49:32,752 --> 00:49:34,014
Uh,

841
00:49:34,058 --> 00:49:36,669
I was offered partner, at the
Dallas office.

842
00:49:36,712 --> 00:49:40,020
That's fantastic knows, I for
one, am elated.

843
00:49:40,064 --> 00:49:44,677
I start right after labor day,
and I want you to come with me.

844
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,855
What?

845
00:49:48,898 --> 00:49:54,600
Come here

846
00:49:54,643 --> 00:49:57,429
Come with me.

847
00:49:57,472 --> 00:50:01,259
Rick, I can't just leave,
everything's here, my home, my work.

848
00:50:01,302 --> 00:50:03,174
I know, I've thought it all out,

849
00:50:03,217 --> 00:50:05,785
Look Pat can run the Gallery
here,

850
00:50:05,828 --> 00:50:09,180
My Frat buddy has connections with
the top art dealers in Dallas,

851
00:50:09,223 --> 00:50:11,834
You can paint anywhere, right?

852
00:50:11,878 --> 00:50:17,057
Look it's only for two years, and then
we can move back here if you want.

853
00:50:17,101 --> 00:50:19,146
You really have thought this all
out.

854
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:20,626
Yeah I was gonna tell you
tonight,

855
00:50:20,669 --> 00:50:25,283
over a romatic dinner but, are
you still here?

856
00:50:25,326 --> 00:50:27,285
Look, I know it's none of my
business,

857
00:50:27,328 --> 00:50:29,200
but what kind of offer is that?

858
00:50:31,071 --> 00:50:32,657
You expect her to just follow you
across the country without a commitment?

859
00:50:32,681 --> 00:50:33,789
Without any promise of a future?

860
00:50:33,813 --> 00:50:35,467
Harry.

861
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:41,386
No, we're friends right? Friends
don't let friends go to Dallas.

862
00:50:41,429 --> 00:50:48,088
Burk, for once, you're right.

863
00:50:48,132 --> 00:50:51,657
Wait, what are you doing, I'm
just spitballing here, get up.

864
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,877
Marry me Susie.

865
00:50:54,921 --> 00:51:00,361
I love you, and I would have
asked you eventually, so why wait?

866
00:51:00,405 --> 00:51:03,495
We've only been going out for
six months.

867
00:51:03,538 --> 00:51:06,019
But we've known each other our
whole lives,

868
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:08,369
I don't wanna make the same
mistake he did,

869
00:51:08,413 --> 00:51:10,067
I don't wanna leave you behind.

870
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:14,723
No fair I was a lot younger than
you.

871
00:51:14,767 --> 00:51:19,337
I don't know what to say.

872
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:25,517
Say you'll think about it.

873
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:38,138
You okay?

874
00:51:38,182 --> 00:51:40,575
I think I'm gonna be sick.

875
00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:48,366
Hey! You've got work to do Mr.
Let's go, fun time's over.

876
00:51:54,415 --> 00:51:59,942
Harry!

877
00:51:59,986 --> 00:52:02,162
No free ice-cream until
wednesday guys.

878
00:52:02,206 --> 00:52:05,557
Does it look like we want free
ice-cream?

879
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:11,258
C'mon over here for a sec.

880
00:52:11,302 --> 00:52:15,697
C'mon I bet on horses faster
than you, hurry up.

881
00:52:15,741 --> 00:52:20,485
Do me a favour, gimme that paper
hat will ya?

882
00:52:20,528 --> 00:52:22,704
Ya know, just because you're
scared to lawn bowl

883
00:52:22,748 --> 00:52:28,275
doesn't mean you gotta drive
around looking like a chump okay?

884
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:31,974
Here's a little something from the
gang here at the seniors centre,

885
00:52:32,018 --> 00:52:35,413
one for you, one for your dad,
one for whats-his-name.

886
00:52:35,456 --> 00:52:39,939
Anyway just our little way of saying
thank you for, for everything.

887
00:52:39,982 --> 00:52:42,202
Thank you Jerry, thank you guys.

888
00:52:42,246 --> 00:52:45,205
And uh, we'll see you next
wednesday huh?

889
00:52:45,249 --> 00:52:47,990
And uh, Don't forget the
pistachio this time huh?

890
00:52:48,034 --> 00:52:49,557
I won't.

891
00:52:49,601 --> 00:52:52,865
He's a good kid huh?

892
00:53:08,707 --> 00:53:11,318
How'd it go?

893
00:53:11,362 --> 00:53:13,015
Jerry gave us some hats.

894
00:53:13,059 --> 00:53:18,238
Oh, nice, what about ice-cream,
did you sell any ice-cream?

895
00:53:18,282 --> 00:53:20,719
Not much.

896
00:53:20,762 --> 00:53:24,375
I don't understand it, Sunday
was our best day.

897
00:53:32,252 --> 00:53:37,692
You know, you wanted me to think
about who I am?

898
00:53:37,736 --> 00:53:45,736
Well I have, truth is, I'm a
selfish, shallow jerk,

899
00:53:48,355 --> 00:53:52,707
who walked away from everybody
who cared about him,

900
00:53:52,751 --> 00:53:56,668
and lost sight of what's
important.

901
00:53:56,711 --> 00:54:04,711
And all these years, I've been
trying not to be like you.

902
00:54:05,807 --> 00:54:10,986
I know, I embarrass you, I
always have.

903
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:14,729
Dad, I'm sorry.

904
00:54:14,773 --> 00:54:18,559
There's no reason to apologize,
it's okay.

905
00:54:18,603 --> 00:54:22,868
No, It's not.

906
00:54:22,911 --> 00:54:26,088
You know, It doesn't really
matter what you do in this life,

907
00:54:26,132 --> 00:54:31,485
What matters is that when you do decide
to do something, you do it right.

908
00:54:31,529 --> 00:54:36,011
You do it with integrity, and
from the heart.

909
00:54:36,055 --> 00:54:41,365
I thought I was, but I was just
kidding myself.

910
00:54:41,408 --> 00:54:45,325
I was a shark, afraid to stop
moving,

911
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:52,724
because if I did, I might
realize how empty I was.

912
00:54:52,767 --> 00:55:00,767
I forgot what it's like to be around
people who actually care about each other.

913
00:55:01,428 --> 00:55:06,128
If I accomplish nothing else this
summer, and I probably won't,

914
00:55:06,172 --> 00:55:07,913
I'm gonna bring your business
back.

915
00:55:07,956 --> 00:55:12,309
No that's not true, we're gonna
bring the business back. You and me.

916
00:55:12,352 --> 00:55:13,919
Are you a magician or something?

917
00:55:13,962 --> 00:55:16,269
A salesman, just like you.

918
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:19,751
Yeah except I sell fudge bars,
you sell hedge funds.

919
00:55:19,794 --> 00:55:27,794
Like I said, we're both
salesmen, try it on.

920
00:55:33,025 --> 00:55:35,332
According to market research,

921
00:55:35,375 --> 00:55:38,378
Espresso's the new latte,
bagel's the new muffin,

922
00:55:38,422 --> 00:55:42,382
Fro-yo's the ice-cream, and
greek yogurt's the new Fro-yo.

923
00:55:42,426 --> 00:55:43,949
I dunno what you're talking
about.

924
00:55:43,992 --> 00:55:45,646
Trends.

925
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:47,450
See that's all you do on Wall
st. isn't it? you follow trends.

926
00:55:47,474 --> 00:55:48,736
No, we make trends.

927
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,434
Trends are fickle.

928
00:55:50,477 --> 00:55:52,000
So are customers.

929
00:55:52,044 --> 00:55:55,700
That's true, I'll tell you
what's not fickle, ice-cream.

930
00:55:55,743 --> 00:55:59,834
It's always cold, it's always
sweet, and it alwys tastes good.

931
00:55:59,878 --> 00:56:02,315
And when the weather turns cold
so does the business,

932
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,727
And we have to deal with that
seasonal issue.

933
00:56:03,751 --> 00:56:05,405
You're right, you're right,
you're right.

934
00:56:05,449 --> 00:56:07,233
And we need a new slogan.

935
00:56:07,276 --> 00:56:11,629
Why? What's wrong with that slogan?
"Everybody needs Ice-cream",

936
00:56:11,672 --> 00:56:12,760
What's wrong with that?

937
00:56:12,804 --> 00:56:14,806
First of all, nobody needs
ice-cream.

938
00:56:14,849 --> 00:56:18,984
Well you can't go and say that,
"Nobody needs ice-cream"?

939
00:56:19,027 --> 00:56:19,898
We need something that pops.

940
00:56:19,941 --> 00:56:21,726
That pops.

941
00:56:21,769 --> 00:56:23,641
"What happens on the truck stays
on the truck"?

942
00:56:23,684 --> 00:56:26,470
Heheh, no.

943
00:56:26,513 --> 00:56:28,210
"Ice-cream never sleeps."

944
00:56:28,254 --> 00:56:29,386
You kidding me?

945
00:56:29,429 --> 00:56:30,996
Okay, it melts.

946
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:35,087
Unless you plug of course,
sorry.

947
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:38,830
I dunno, I always thought things
would just stay the same.

948
00:56:38,873 --> 00:56:40,440
Change isn't always a bad thing.

949
00:56:40,484 --> 00:56:42,399
It's not always good either.

950
00:56:42,442 --> 00:56:46,403
It can be, there's been a few
improvements since the VCR.

951
00:56:46,446 --> 00:56:50,189
Alright, I'll tell you one thing
that I wouldn't mind changing.

952
00:56:50,232 --> 00:56:53,932
That song. That music on the truck
has been the same for 20 years,

953
00:56:53,975 --> 00:56:55,499
it's driving me mental.

954
00:56:55,542 --> 00:56:56,848
Then why do you keep playing it?

955
00:56:56,891 --> 00:57:00,504
I dunno, I guess I'm just lazy,
it's a habit.

956
00:57:00,547 --> 00:57:02,375
Dad you can listen to anything
you want,

957
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:06,640
what do you wanna hear? Rock?
Classical, Oldies?, New age?

958
00:57:06,684 --> 00:57:10,470
Really? I like Jazz, I could
have Jazz.

959
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:12,124
Jazz...

960
00:57:12,167 --> 00:57:16,824
Retro yet edgie, soothing yet
somehow distrubing, I like it.

961
00:57:16,868 --> 00:57:17,521
Really?

962
00:57:17,564 --> 00:57:18,957
Yeah.

963
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:19,958
You're not just saying that to
make me feel good?

964
00:57:20,001 --> 00:57:21,307
Jazz.

965
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:22,676
Imagine an ice-cream truck that
plays Jazz.

966
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,223
Take me to it Daddy-o.

967
00:57:24,266 --> 00:57:25,354
That'd be pretty good.

968
00:57:25,398 --> 00:57:28,009
Yeah.

969
00:57:39,325 --> 00:57:41,893
Good shot, Here you go Jer-Bear.

970
00:57:41,936 --> 00:57:45,505
Thank you Harry, really appreciate
this, gonna hit the spot.

971
00:57:45,549 --> 00:57:47,072
Here, put these in the freezer
will ya?

972
00:57:47,115 --> 00:57:49,117
I know how many are supposed to
be in there.

973
00:57:49,161 --> 00:57:50,989
Alright, okay.

974
00:57:51,032 --> 00:57:56,168
Let's show this guy something he can't
learn on the internet 'eh fellas?

975
00:58:07,614 --> 00:58:13,577
Woah woah woah woah!

976
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:18,233
Alright here we go eh.

977
00:58:25,327 --> 00:58:27,765
I thought you'd never done this
before huh?

978
00:58:27,808 --> 00:58:33,553
It's not nice to lie to your
elders.

979
00:58:33,597 --> 00:58:36,338
Look at that!

980
00:58:42,127 --> 00:58:44,564
I get first dibs on the
ice-cream.

981
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:45,913
Re-match Jerry, next week.

982
00:58:45,957 --> 00:58:53,138
Next week.

983
00:58:53,181 --> 00:58:58,970
See ya Harry.

984
00:58:59,013 --> 00:59:00,580
Those guys are intense.

985
00:59:00,624 --> 00:59:03,496
Jerry's city champ, how much did
you lose?

986
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,063
A box of pistachio bars.

987
00:59:05,106 --> 00:59:10,416
Ugh, you got off easy, I had to
paint the activity room.

988
00:59:10,459 --> 00:59:15,943
So, Dallas, you'll need some
cowboy boots, and a big hat.

989
00:59:15,987 --> 00:59:20,992
Dallas actually has some paved roads
these days, with buildings and everything.

990
00:59:21,035 --> 00:59:22,646
Is that what Rick told you?

991
00:59:22,689 --> 00:59:25,692
'Cause you cant trust anything
that guys says, he's a Lawyer.

992
00:59:25,736 --> 00:59:30,349
Well, If you're asking if I've
decided yet, I haven't.

993
00:59:30,392 --> 00:59:33,047
Good.

994
00:59:33,091 --> 00:59:36,094
You do realize this doesn't
actually involve you.

995
00:59:36,137 --> 00:59:40,620
Actually it does, he wouldn't
have proposed if it wasn't for me.

996
00:59:40,664 --> 00:59:43,971
So you're saying you don't think
he's really in love with me.

997
00:59:44,015 --> 00:59:49,150
Of course he's in love with you,
who wouldn't be?

998
00:59:54,373 --> 00:59:55,417
Shouldn't you get that?

999
00:59:55,461 --> 00:59:56,984
It can wait.

1000
00:59:57,028 --> 00:59:58,464
What if it's a job offer?

1001
00:59:58,507 --> 01:00:01,554
I have a job, besides I can't
leave here right now.

1002
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:04,862
What's wrong?

1003
01:00:04,905 --> 01:00:07,952
Rocky Roads is closing its
coolers.

1004
01:00:07,995 --> 01:00:09,954
What?

1005
01:00:09,997 --> 01:00:11,608
Yeah, My dad didn't want to tell
me.

1006
01:00:11,651 --> 01:00:13,871
He didn't want to look like a
failure in front of me.

1007
01:00:13,914 --> 01:00:17,657
I'm so sorry, Rocky Roads is
his whole life

1008
01:00:17,701 --> 01:00:19,528
I know.

1009
01:00:19,572 --> 01:00:22,662
I can't imagine this place
without it.

1010
01:00:22,706 --> 01:00:27,232
You know, your parents gave me
my first paint set.

1011
01:00:27,275 --> 01:00:29,843
Oh yeah, the pink eisel.

1012
01:00:29,887 --> 01:00:35,370
Yeah, it was my tenth birthday,
and we had pink ice-cream too.

1013
01:00:35,414 --> 01:00:35,936
Oh yeah.

1014
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:38,199
Yeah.

1015
01:00:38,243 --> 01:00:41,550
You know, if you need help with
anything, just let me know.

1016
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:44,728
You snooze you lose old-timer

1017
01:00:44,771 --> 01:00:45,946
Old timer?

1018
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:47,774
That must hurt.

1019
01:00:47,818 --> 01:00:49,689
You're the same age as me.

1020
01:00:49,733 --> 01:00:53,388
Oh, cut him off at 4th and settle
this thing at the kiddy pool.

1021
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:57,044
See you tomorrow.

1022
01:00:57,088 --> 01:00:58,437
Tomorrow?

1023
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,612
It's Sunday, church.

1024
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:02,397
Wow, that's four times in four
weeks.

1025
01:01:02,441 --> 01:01:03,790
You counting?

1026
01:01:03,834 --> 01:01:11,755
Everyone is, Reverend's got a
pool going.

1027
01:01:11,798 --> 01:01:13,887
Hey, Mr.Price.

1028
01:01:13,931 --> 01:01:15,672
Hey buddy boy.

1029
01:01:15,715 --> 01:01:16,411
Thanks for getting back to me.

1030
01:01:16,455 --> 01:01:17,761
Alright here it is.

1031
01:01:17,804 --> 01:01:19,260
Any longer and I'm gonna be as
old as you man!

1032
01:01:19,284 --> 01:01:22,591
C'mon gramps I 'ain't got all
day.

1033
01:01:22,635 --> 01:01:27,771
Hey I'm just closing a deal,
talk later.

1034
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:32,253
Ethnic food's pretty popular
these days.

1035
01:01:32,297 --> 01:01:34,603
Yeah there's a lot of signs
there.

1036
01:01:34,647 --> 01:01:35,953
It doesn't go bad as quick.

1037
01:01:35,996 --> 01:01:37,606
That's a good point.

1038
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:39,913
You boys gonna be at this for a
while?

1039
01:01:39,957 --> 01:01:42,437
Ice-cream never sleeps
sweetheart.

1040
01:01:42,481 --> 01:01:45,440
Can I get you anything else? Hot
water and lemon?

1041
01:01:45,484 --> 01:01:47,288
Okay now I don't want you to
take this the wrong way,

1042
01:01:47,312 --> 01:01:51,403
but I never want to see another
cup of hot water and lemon again.

1043
01:01:51,446 --> 01:01:53,100
I guess a little coffee couldn't
hurt.

1044
01:01:53,144 --> 01:01:56,060
Make mine a double espressso,
it's an all-nighter here.

1045
01:01:56,103 --> 01:01:58,149
Harrison, where do we keep the
high octane stuff?

1046
01:01:58,192 --> 01:02:02,457
Uh, between the electric pepper
mill and the rice cooker.

1047
01:02:02,501 --> 01:02:05,199
Oh, I'm starving.

1048
01:02:05,243 --> 01:02:13,243
She does these great.

1049
01:02:13,817 --> 01:02:15,993
Sticks.

1050
01:02:16,036 --> 01:02:17,777
What?

1051
01:02:17,821 --> 01:02:22,129
Sticks are the new forks.

1052
01:02:22,173 --> 01:02:28,353
I know how we're gonna save
Rocky Road.

1053
01:02:28,396 --> 01:02:30,790
Oh that's Major, you want all
the ovens?

1054
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:32,226
Yeah, sounds good

1055
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:33,140
You're the boss.

1056
01:02:33,184 --> 01:02:34,881
Oh, now you're catching on.

1057
01:02:34,925 --> 01:02:40,104
Yeah, it takes me a while, when
I get there I get there.

1058
01:02:40,147 --> 01:02:42,846
Woah dudes, what happened here?

1059
01:02:42,889 --> 01:02:45,805
Well we're re-tooling, if you
wanna know.

1060
01:02:45,849 --> 01:02:47,807
We're diversifying see.

1061
01:02:47,851 --> 01:02:50,375
We're gonna do cold food in the
summer,

1062
01:02:50,418 --> 01:02:53,813
we're gonna do comfort food in
the winter, and you're late again.

1063
01:02:53,857 --> 01:02:55,467
Oh yeah sorry, 'cause I was at
the..

1064
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:57,208
The Library?

1065
01:02:57,251 --> 01:02:58,731
Oh how'd you know?

1066
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,820
Lucky guess.

1067
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:02,058
My son doesn't tolerate
lateness,

1068
01:03:02,082 --> 01:03:04,606
you wanna work here, you gotta
be on time.

1069
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:08,828
So grab some gloves, and pass me
the channel locks okay?

1070
01:03:08,872 --> 01:03:10,003
Uh, the which?

1071
01:03:10,047 --> 01:03:13,180
Blue handles.

1072
01:03:13,224 --> 01:03:14,921
Am I still on the B route?

1073
01:03:14,965 --> 01:03:17,010
Oh all that's changing too.

1074
01:03:17,054 --> 01:03:17,663
There ya go.

1075
01:03:17,706 --> 01:03:19,578
Cool.

1076
01:03:52,132 --> 01:03:53,699
Hello.

1077
01:03:53,742 --> 01:03:55,875
Hey.

1078
01:03:55,919 --> 01:03:58,573
Listen to this.

1079
01:03:58,617 --> 01:04:03,883
Okay, well there's also this.

1080
01:04:03,927 --> 01:04:05,798
Oh, Fiona Draper's garden?

1081
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,974
No, she had a dog in her yard.

1082
01:04:08,018 --> 01:04:09,280
It's a Chihuahua

1083
01:04:09,323 --> 01:04:11,804
Well it sounded bigger.

1084
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:18,680
Come in, I'm almost finished.

1085
01:04:18,724 --> 01:04:20,900
Wow, I haven't been here since..

1086
01:04:20,944 --> 01:04:23,816
You plugged your truck into the
house and blew the electrical panel?

1087
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,644
Right, I forgot about that.

1088
01:04:25,687 --> 01:04:27,907
My parents didn't, they still
mention it.

1089
01:04:27,951 --> 01:04:29,691
They do?

1090
01:04:31,345 --> 01:04:35,915
Yup, and now that I talk to them
twice a day they mention it a lot.

1091
01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:42,052
Here, take a look I finished
your new artwork.

1092
01:04:42,095 --> 01:04:43,401
It's amazing!

1093
01:04:43,444 --> 01:04:45,011
Yeah do you like it?

1094
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,360
I love it.

1095
01:04:46,404 --> 01:04:47,144
Thank you Susie.

1096
01:04:47,187 --> 01:04:48,797
You're welcome.

1097
01:04:48,841 --> 01:04:50,601
You know if you didn't put me in
the friend zone, I'd hug you.

1098
01:04:50,625 --> 01:04:52,366
Friends can hug.

1099
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:54,586
Come here.

1100
01:04:54,629 --> 01:04:55,804
Can they kiss?

1101
01:04:55,848 --> 01:04:59,330
Alright, when is the grand
reopening?

1102
01:04:59,373 --> 01:05:04,248
Labor day weekend, the same say you're
going to break Rick Johnson's heart.

1103
01:05:04,291 --> 01:05:06,293
You never give up do you?

1104
01:05:06,337 --> 01:05:08,078
Like a recurring nightmare.

1105
01:05:08,121 --> 01:05:12,038
I was thinking more along the
lines of pest, but nightmare works.

1106
01:05:12,082 --> 01:05:16,956
Okay labor day weekend, are you
thinking Saturday, Sunday, or Monday?

1107
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,654
Saturday so we have three solid
days to sell.

1108
01:05:19,698 --> 01:05:26,096
I thought so.

1109
01:05:26,139 --> 01:05:31,449
Hey, I thought you tore up all
our old pictures.

1110
01:05:31,492 --> 01:05:37,194
Oh, right, well how many girls can say they
went to their prom in an ice cream truck?

1111
01:05:37,237 --> 01:05:39,326
Yeah, sorry about that.

1112
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:41,850
Are you kidding? that was the
best.

1113
01:05:41,894 --> 01:05:43,156
You were freezing

1114
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:46,203
No, it was the best.

1115
01:05:46,246 --> 01:05:47,073
Yeah.

1116
01:05:47,117 --> 01:05:48,857
Mhmm.

1117
01:05:48,901 --> 01:05:51,034
Hey, you still got that
trampoline out back?

1118
01:05:51,077 --> 01:05:51,991
What do you think?

1119
01:05:52,035 --> 01:05:53,950
Sweet.

1120
01:06:03,698 --> 01:06:07,485
This used to be a lot easier.

1121
01:06:21,542 --> 01:06:23,675
Oh man, I'm too old for that.

1122
01:06:23,718 --> 01:06:26,591
Yes you are.

1123
01:06:26,634 --> 01:06:28,723
It feels like I never left
this place.

1124
01:06:28,767 --> 01:06:30,769
Almost.

1125
01:06:30,812 --> 01:06:33,119
There's 8 million people in
Manhattan.

1126
01:06:33,163 --> 01:06:37,341
It's crazy to think that with 8 million people
living with you, you can still feel alone.

1127
01:06:37,384 --> 01:06:39,082
Do you feel alone here?

1128
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:46,045
No, how could I with everyone
watching my every move?

1129
01:06:46,089 --> 01:06:47,849
What does that guy have a GPS on
me or something?

1130
01:06:47,873 --> 01:06:49,744
No, we're meeting the Reverend
here.

1131
01:06:49,788 --> 01:06:51,050
Oh.

1132
01:06:51,094 --> 01:06:52,486
Councelling.

1133
01:06:52,530 --> 01:06:55,141
For Rick's emotional
shortcomings?

1134
01:06:55,185 --> 01:06:57,317
Premarital councelling.

1135
01:06:57,361 --> 01:07:00,146
Oh no.

1136
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:03,062
Well, you want me to leave out
the back gate?

1137
01:07:03,106 --> 01:07:04,716
We're not in High School.

1138
01:07:04,759 --> 01:07:06,631
You're not, I'm not so sure
about me and him.

1139
01:07:06,674 --> 01:07:09,416
Well he probably already saw
your bike on the front lawn so.

1140
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:15,379
Right.

1141
01:07:15,422 --> 01:07:18,208
Oh what a treat, it's Rick.

1142
01:07:18,251 --> 01:07:19,470
You look nice.

1143
01:07:19,513 --> 01:07:20,558
Thank you.

1144
01:07:20,601 --> 01:07:22,038
Not you.

1145
01:07:22,081 --> 01:07:23,648
Did you tip my bike?

1146
01:07:23,691 --> 01:07:26,955
Nope, looks like you got a flat
tire though. Tough break.

1147
01:07:26,999 --> 01:07:28,783
That's funny, it wasn't flat
when I got here.

1148
01:07:28,827 --> 01:07:30,524
Don't look at me.

1149
01:07:30,568 --> 01:07:32,372
Well it's hard to avoid it when
you seem to show up everywhere.

1150
01:07:32,396 --> 01:07:35,529
Ugh, I'll drop the artwork off
at the printers okay?

1151
01:07:35,573 --> 01:07:36,269
Thanks Susie.

1152
01:07:36,313 --> 01:07:38,054
You're welcome, Hi.

1153
01:07:38,097 --> 01:07:40,665
Come here.

1154
01:08:00,728 --> 01:08:01,555
Harry.

1155
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:03,949
Oh hey Reverend.

1156
01:08:03,992 --> 01:08:05,646
Looks like you got a flat tire
there.

1157
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:07,257
Yeah.

1158
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:09,128
What are you doing with that
toothpick?

1159
01:08:09,172 --> 01:08:10,608
Nothing.

1160
01:08:10,651 --> 01:08:12,281
Good, because we don't believe
in an eye for an eye.

1161
01:08:12,305 --> 01:08:14,046
What about a tire for a tire?

1162
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,353
Turn the other cheek.

1163
01:08:16,396 --> 01:08:19,225
Right, so Premarital councelling
huh?

1164
01:08:19,269 --> 01:08:24,317
Yeah, I look forward to doing
that for you one day.

1165
01:08:24,361 --> 01:08:26,493
Give it here, come on.

1166
01:08:26,537 --> 01:08:28,800
I'll see you in church Harry.

1167
01:08:28,843 --> 01:08:29,888
Still Sunday right?

1168
01:08:29,931 --> 01:08:34,284
Sunday and every day.

1169
01:09:11,321 --> 01:09:14,846
Well, that was interesting.

1170
01:09:14,889 --> 01:09:18,197
I think there's a few things we
need to work on.

1171
01:09:18,241 --> 01:09:22,375
Oh! Rick remember, the key is
listening.

1172
01:09:22,419 --> 01:09:23,202
Got it.

1173
01:09:23,246 --> 01:09:23,942
What?

1174
01:09:23,985 --> 01:09:24,812
I said got it.

1175
01:09:24,856 --> 01:09:28,207
I'm just kidding.

1176
01:09:28,251 --> 01:09:30,296
I was nervous.

1177
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:31,950
It's okay.

1178
01:09:31,993 --> 01:09:34,300
I gotta go, I'll call you later?

1179
01:09:34,344 --> 01:09:37,695
Yeah, would you mind dropping
this off at the printers for me?

1180
01:09:37,738 --> 01:09:40,306
According to the Reverend I
should say yes.

1181
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:42,308
All the information's on the
post it,

1182
01:09:42,352 --> 01:09:44,658
I just called and they're gonna
do a rush job for me.

1183
01:09:44,702 --> 01:09:48,227
Ten to Four P.M. stone park,
Saturday Labour day weekend.

1184
01:09:48,271 --> 01:09:49,097
Got it!

1185
01:09:49,141 --> 01:09:51,535
See, listening, doing.

1186
01:09:51,578 --> 01:09:54,059
Yeah, great, thank you.

1187
01:09:54,102 --> 01:10:02,102
Okay, I am gonna do this, I'm a good
boy, I'm a catch, listening and doing.

1188
01:10:04,243 --> 01:10:12,243
Yeah, listening and doing, you can do
this, you can do this, listening and doing.

1189
01:10:13,905 --> 01:10:21,905
Okay, on a mission, I am going
to do this.

1190
01:10:28,615 --> 01:10:33,446
Susie said you were expecting this, all
the information's on the post-it note...

1191
01:10:33,490 --> 01:10:41,490
Uh, alright it's Stone Park,
Labor day, ten a.m. to four p.m.

1192
01:10:41,889 --> 01:10:44,979
Looks like labor day's on Monday
the third this year.

1193
01:10:45,023 --> 01:10:46,416
See, I'm a listener.

1194
01:11:18,926 --> 01:11:22,930
These Rocky Road signs are all
over town.

1195
01:11:22,974 --> 01:11:24,018
You know what I don't get?

1196
01:11:24,062 --> 01:11:25,455
Another card.

1197
01:11:25,498 --> 01:11:26,910
Why would they have the grand
opening on a Monday?

1198
01:11:26,934 --> 01:11:29,502
I mean it makes more sense to do
it on a Saturday,

1199
01:11:29,546 --> 01:11:31,567
that way you take advantage of
the three day weekend.

1200
01:11:31,591 --> 01:11:36,727
Well there ought to be an ordanace
against posting signs on every corner.

1201
01:11:36,770 --> 01:11:38,642
I don't think so Fiona.

1202
01:11:38,685 --> 01:11:42,515
Well there ought to be, and you
should bring it up at Sunday sermon.

1203
01:11:42,559 --> 01:11:45,605
Sunday's sermon is love thy
neighbour.

1204
01:11:45,649 --> 01:11:49,348
I'm gonna give Harry a call,
it's bad business!

1205
01:11:49,392 --> 01:11:51,219
I wouldn't play that one.

1206
01:11:51,263 --> 01:11:57,182
I'm sure Harry knows what he's
doing and it's a no talk game Fiona.

1207
01:11:57,225 --> 01:12:02,361
You seen how much time Susie's
been spending with that boy?

1208
01:12:02,405 --> 01:12:04,798
I don't know what she sees in
him.

1209
01:12:04,842 --> 01:12:06,496
He's a good kid, give him a
break.

1210
01:12:06,539 --> 01:12:10,282
He's a Rose thief, and she ought
to stick with that Johnson boy.

1211
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:13,677
Let's see how it all plays out.

1212
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:16,375
Hahaha. Gin.

1213
01:12:16,419 --> 01:12:19,160
Told you not to play that card.

1214
01:12:19,204 --> 01:12:23,469
Oh I wish we were playing for
money.

1215
01:12:23,513 --> 01:12:25,906
Is it delicious?

1216
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:28,474
Here try one.

1217
01:12:28,518 --> 01:12:31,695
Mmm, delicious!

1218
01:12:31,738 --> 01:12:32,739
Really?

1219
01:12:32,783 --> 01:12:34,393
Yeah.

1220
01:12:34,437 --> 01:12:42,437
Delicious.

1221
01:12:44,708 --> 01:12:47,363
Oh!

1222
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:51,497
It's perfect.

1223
01:12:51,541 --> 01:12:52,368
Really?

1224
01:12:52,411 --> 01:12:54,021
Really.

1225
01:12:54,065 --> 01:12:57,460
I can't believe summer's ending
already.

1226
01:12:57,503 --> 01:12:59,679
Yeah I know it went by so fast.

1227
01:12:59,723 --> 01:13:01,289
Yeah it did.

1228
01:13:01,333 --> 01:13:03,248
You know where time goes really
slow?

1229
01:13:03,291 --> 01:13:04,249
Texas.

1230
01:13:04,292 --> 01:13:06,033
Is that so?

1231
01:13:06,077 --> 01:13:10,429
Mhmm, Cowboy Rick's hitting the
trail Tuesday right?

1232
01:13:10,473 --> 01:13:13,911
Will you be riding shotgun?

1233
01:13:13,954 --> 01:13:16,696
I haven't decided.

1234
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:20,831
Well you know the Reverend says if you truly
love someone you don't have to decide,

1235
01:13:20,874 --> 01:13:22,441
you just know.

1236
01:13:22,485 --> 01:13:23,964
When did the Reverend say that?

1237
01:13:24,008 --> 01:13:27,446
Last Sunday at church, I guess
I'm winning the pool.

1238
01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:29,448
Okay maybe I said it.

1239
01:13:29,492 --> 01:13:32,930
Maybe you just don't want Rick
to win.

1240
01:13:32,973 --> 01:13:39,806
If I hadn't left town would we
still be together?

1241
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:42,026
I don't know.

1242
01:13:42,069 --> 01:13:46,117
I do.

1243
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,641
Don't do this Harry.

1244
01:13:48,685 --> 01:13:52,819
Don't try and charm me back into this
again, because you're just going to leave!

1245
01:13:52,863 --> 01:13:56,432
You know you are.

1246
01:13:56,475 --> 01:13:58,172
Okay are we done yet?

1247
01:13:58,216 --> 01:14:02,263
You know we hit the road tomorrow
we gotta be ready, let's go.

1248
01:14:02,307 --> 01:14:07,312
Are we done?

1249
01:14:07,355 --> 01:14:09,619
Susie.

1250
01:14:09,662 --> 01:14:14,580
I think we are.

1251
01:14:14,624 --> 01:14:19,063
It's fantastic, isn't it Ben?

1252
01:14:19,106 --> 01:14:20,760
Ben what's wrong are you sick?

1253
01:14:20,804 --> 01:14:23,850
Am I sick? no, I'm not sick, why
would I be sick?

1254
01:14:23,894 --> 01:14:25,330
Do you not like it Mr.Burk?

1255
01:14:25,373 --> 01:14:30,335
What? No, the truck is fantastic
it's a great job.

1256
01:14:30,378 --> 01:14:33,425
No I just suppose I'm starting
to feel a little nerves,

1257
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:39,779
I mean we start tomorrow and I don't
want to fail in front of my family.

1258
01:14:39,823 --> 01:14:47,823
You know dad, no matter what
happens, you're already a success.

1259
01:14:48,353 --> 01:14:49,136
Me?

1260
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:51,051
Yes you.

1261
01:14:51,095 --> 01:14:54,141
You know I've been looking up to these
heavy hitters on Wall st. for years,

1262
01:14:54,185 --> 01:14:56,361
I should have been looking up to
you.

1263
01:14:56,404 --> 01:15:01,497
You're there for people, you're
honest, your word is your word,

1264
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,847
I mean you give away free
ice-cream to cheer people up,

1265
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:05,675
while your business is going
under.

1266
01:15:05,718 --> 01:15:08,416
Some people say that man's a
fool.

1267
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:14,379
No dad, that's the kind of man I
wanna be.

1268
01:15:14,422 --> 01:15:19,297
Well thank you son, thanks son.

1269
01:15:41,711 --> 01:15:43,016
What time is it?

1270
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:43,930
Where's your watch?

1271
01:15:43,974 --> 01:15:46,454
We sold it to buy the grill.

1272
01:15:46,498 --> 01:15:48,848
Look this is a disaster there's
nobody coming.

1273
01:15:48,892 --> 01:15:49,719
They'll come.

1274
01:15:49,762 --> 01:15:51,938
We've been here two hours.

1275
01:15:51,982 --> 01:15:57,291
Hey boss, I mean this is a bust,
you think I can take off?

1276
01:15:57,335 --> 01:15:59,642
Take off Razor, see you later.

1277
01:15:59,685 --> 01:16:02,079
I don't get it, we did
everything right.

1278
01:16:02,122 --> 01:16:05,212
Maybe we over sold, maybe we
just pushed too hard I dunno.

1279
01:16:05,256 --> 01:16:06,605
How can no one show up?

1280
01:16:06,649 --> 01:16:09,608
The Reverend, you're friends,
not even Susie.

1281
01:16:09,652 --> 01:16:11,610
I saw her at the bakery with
Rick this morning,

1282
01:16:11,654 --> 01:16:18,399
I didn't want to say anything,
she was wearing a cowboy hat.

1283
01:16:18,443 --> 01:16:19,400
I guess that's it then.

1284
01:16:19,444 --> 01:16:21,228
Well, We tried.

1285
01:16:21,272 --> 01:16:24,101
I'm sorry dad, I really wanted
this for us.

1286
01:16:24,144 --> 01:16:25,624
Nothing to be sorry about,

1287
01:16:25,668 --> 01:16:30,150
Okay let's just pack up the food
and let's get out of here.

1288
01:16:39,246 --> 01:16:41,684
Yo guys, I can't believe I
didn't notice this,

1289
01:16:41,727 --> 01:16:43,729
some idiot wrote Labour day as a
Monday.

1290
01:16:43,773 --> 01:16:44,817
Lemme see this.

1291
01:16:44,861 --> 01:16:48,342
Check it out.

1292
01:16:48,386 --> 01:16:51,215
Oh well the food's not going to
keep for two days.

1293
01:16:51,258 --> 01:16:55,132
Razor, smart phone, Stat.

1294
01:16:55,175 --> 01:16:57,787
I'll Ping everyone with twitter,
there is twitter here right?

1295
01:16:57,830 --> 01:16:59,658
What do you think, we're
dinosaurs?

1296
01:16:59,702 --> 01:17:03,227
Hey dude, look I'm on Twitter,
Instagram, Facebook, Vine, and Kick.

1297
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:08,058
Gimme that thing.

1298
01:17:08,101 --> 01:17:10,538
Okay it's gotta be a good
hashtag though.

1299
01:17:10,582 --> 01:17:14,499
Okay, I got this.

1300
01:17:14,542 --> 01:17:19,591
Oh Rick.

1301
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:24,248
Hey, check this out.

1302
01:17:24,291 --> 01:17:28,208
Oh my, Let's go.

1303
01:17:40,394 --> 01:17:47,140
Oh this is exciting, come on
everybody, let's go, come on!

1304
01:17:47,184 --> 01:17:52,885
Hey guys check this out! We
gotta go.

1305
01:18:02,852 --> 01:18:07,117
Huh?

1306
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:11,295
Ah, look at this, looks like
they're sticking with us after all.

1307
01:18:11,338 --> 01:18:13,514
Let's get this party Started.

1308
01:18:13,558 --> 01:18:16,343
Hiya, come on through.

1309
01:18:16,387 --> 01:18:19,477
Good thing I've got 7000
followers on twitter huh?

1310
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:22,219
That 6999 more than I have.

1311
01:18:33,056 --> 01:18:36,624
Excuse me, could I have your
attention please?

1312
01:18:36,668 --> 01:18:38,104
I'd just like to say a few
words.

1313
01:18:38,148 --> 01:18:41,325
You have no idea how good it is
to see all of you.

1314
01:18:41,368 --> 01:18:44,241
It's funny this truck used to
embarrass me,

1315
01:18:44,284 --> 01:18:50,247
but I guess it took losing everything
to find out what's really important.

1316
01:18:50,290 --> 01:18:54,686
Turns out it's been right in
front of me all along,

1317
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:57,254
and at the risk of sounding
corny,

1318
01:18:57,297 --> 01:19:00,823
sometimes the best road is the
Rocky Road home.

1319
01:19:11,616 --> 01:19:15,620
Okay form a line here, I'll start
taking orders. This is what we got,

1320
01:19:15,663 --> 01:19:19,624
Cheeseburger on a stick, Tuna?
Okay.

1321
01:19:36,902 --> 01:19:39,513
You did a good job.

1322
01:19:39,557 --> 01:19:41,559
We did a good job.

1323
01:19:41,602 --> 01:19:45,041
That was a really good speech,
did you mean all that?

1324
01:19:45,084 --> 01:19:46,346
You couldn't tell?

1325
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:49,349
Well you are quite the smooth
talker.

1326
01:19:49,393 --> 01:19:53,266
Well I'm not that smooth or else
you wouldn't be going to Dallas.

1327
01:19:53,310 --> 01:19:56,182
Yeah, well, I'll come back to
visit.

1328
01:19:56,226 --> 01:20:00,621
And I'll be here.

1329
01:20:00,665 --> 01:20:05,583
Hey, look I owe you an apology.

1330
01:20:05,626 --> 01:20:07,890
Just one?

1331
01:20:07,933 --> 01:20:13,025
Look I think I might have screwed
up your poster, not intentionally.

1332
01:20:13,069 --> 01:20:15,245
It's okay.

1333
01:20:15,288 --> 01:20:16,681
It is?

1334
01:20:16,724 --> 01:20:18,857
Yeah,

1335
01:20:18,901 --> 01:20:20,966
I mean we've been trying to let the air
out of each other's tires for a while now.

1336
01:20:20,990 --> 01:20:23,775
That wasn't me.

1337
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:28,214
It's okay man, I want us to
start over.

1338
01:20:28,258 --> 01:20:30,042
As what?

1339
01:20:30,086 --> 01:20:31,696
Friends.

1340
01:20:31,739 --> 01:20:33,698
Friends?

1341
01:20:33,741 --> 01:20:36,329
We already have a couple things in
common, we both don't like eachother,

1342
01:20:36,353 --> 01:20:41,706
and we care about the same girl.

1343
01:20:41,749 --> 01:20:46,450
Well, good luck in Dallas. Take
good care of her.

1344
01:20:46,493 --> 01:20:51,585
I will.

1345
01:20:58,027 --> 01:21:02,031
Hey, you ever want lawn bowling
lessons kid, just let me know alright?

1346
01:21:02,074 --> 01:21:04,990
You know what Jerry? I might
take you up on that.

1347
01:21:05,034 --> 01:21:09,647
Alright, take care.

1348
01:21:09,690 --> 01:21:17,350
There we are, we did it.

1349
01:21:17,394 --> 01:21:20,092
I mean what a day a total
sellout, unbelieveable.

1350
01:21:20,136 --> 01:21:22,399
Hey we'll have to go back
tomorrow.

1351
01:21:23,095 --> 01:21:25,663
Cash and carry?

1352
01:21:25,706 --> 01:21:28,231
I have to get this.

1353
01:21:28,274 --> 01:21:29,928
Hey Mr.Price.

1354
01:21:29,972 --> 01:21:32,931
You're not taking my calls that
can only mean one thing right?

1355
01:21:32,975 --> 01:21:37,936
Who stole you away? G.S.? Not
Meryl,

1356
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:41,418
Can't have you working for the
enemy now can we?

1357
01:21:41,461 --> 01:21:45,944
So here it is, I'm prepared to offer you
your apartment, car, expense account,

1358
01:21:45,988 --> 01:21:51,471
and your job back, starting
yesterday with a 10% bonus.

1359
01:21:51,515 --> 01:21:59,515
That's very generous, but I'm
going to have to say no.

1360
01:22:00,132 --> 01:22:02,656
Always negotiating eh Harrison?

1361
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:09,925
You know you've been like a son
to me so I can go to uh 20%.

1362
01:22:09,968 --> 01:22:15,495
Actually I already have a Father,
he's right here next to my mother.

1363
01:22:15,539 --> 01:22:18,890
We've got two trucks and if business
goes the way I think it will,

1364
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:21,414
We'll have four by winter and
then six,

1365
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:23,258
and then one day in the not to
distant future,

1366
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,961
You're going to look out of your
hermetically sealed high rise window

1367
01:22:26,985 --> 01:22:28,745
and see one of those trucks, and
A billboard,

1368
01:22:29,205 --> 01:22:31,642
maybe even a little sky writing,
overselling?

1369
01:22:31,685 --> 01:22:34,427
Not at all.

1370
01:22:34,471 --> 01:22:38,257
You're going to give up
everything for that?

1371
01:22:38,301 --> 01:22:41,043
That is everything, that's my
family.

1372
01:22:41,086 --> 01:22:43,654
I guess I had you wrong.

1373
01:22:43,697 --> 01:22:51,697
I had me wrong too. Goodbye Mr.Price,
when we go public we'll call you.

1374
01:22:53,446 --> 01:22:57,276
Alright, I'm gonna need two things:
My own place and a new phone.

1375
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:59,322
Preferablly smaller than a
coffin.

1376
01:22:59,365 --> 01:23:03,500
I gotta tell you son, I'm very
proud of you Harrison.

1377
01:23:03,543 --> 01:23:07,721
Thanks dad. What do you say we
go back to Harry?

1378
01:23:07,765 --> 01:23:11,725
Absolutely not! What kind of a

Nah, you were right, I was
mis-diagnosed.

1385

01:24:27,410 --> 01:24:30,456
Who you calling old man? Why don't
you get back there and re-stock,

1396
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:32,154

1397
01:24:32,197 --> 01:24:34,112
Alright, alright.

1398
01:24:34,156 --> 01:24:36,549
Harry.

1399
01:24:36,593 --> 01:24:38,421
I got something for the seniors
centre.

1400
01:24:38,464 --> 01:24:41,032
Please, no more ice cream, we
got enough to last us a month.

1401
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:43,295
Better than Ice cream, and it
won't melt.

1402
01:24:43,339 --> 01:24:45,123
What the heck is this?

1403
01:24:45,167 --> 01:24:47,778
Turns out I was over gifting,
think you could use some speakers?

1404
01:24:47,821 --> 01:24:49,562
What HI-FI?

1405
01:24:49,606 --> 01:24:50,998
Surround sound.

1406
01:24:51,042 --> 01:24:53,653
Aw thank you very much, that's
very kind of you,

1407
01:24:53,697 --> 01:24:59,094
let's see if I can get that kid of
yours to help me carry this thing.

1408
01:24:59,137 --> 01:25:01,313
The Gotlands are renewing their
vows next month,

1409
01:25:01,357 --> 01:25:03,054
you interested in catering?

1410
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:04,708
I'll check our schedule.

1411
01:25:04,751 --> 01:25:08,320
I'll take that as a yes.

1412
01:25:47,185 --> 01:25:49,361
I thought you were heading out
today!

1413
01:25:49,405 --> 01:25:51,102
I thought so too.

1414
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:53,017
Flight delay?

1415
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:59,371
Nope, I got all the way to the
airport but, I couldn't do it.

1416
01:25:59,415 --> 01:26:01,504
I told Rick no.

1417
01:26:01,547 --> 01:26:03,027
You did?

1418
01:26:03,070 --> 01:26:06,335
Yeah, I think he was relieved.

1419
01:26:06,378 --> 01:26:07,640
I know I am.

1420
01:26:07,684 --> 01:26:10,295
I mean I'm sorry, actually, I'm
not sorry,

1421
01:26:10,339 --> 01:26:13,385
I couldn't be less sorry.

1422
01:26:13,429 --> 01:26:16,214
So you're staying?

1423
01:26:16,258 --> 01:26:18,738
Yeah I'm staying.

1424
01:26:18,782 --> 01:26:23,308
That's great, because I gotta be
honest, I'm not over you Susie,

1425
01:26:23,352 --> 01:26:26,311
and I never will be.

1426
01:26:26,355 --> 01:26:34,355
I'm not over you either.

1427
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:45,504
Don't mind us.

1428
01:26:45,548 --> 01:26:46,288
Ride with me?

1429
01:26:46,331 --> 01:26:46,984
Yeah.

1430
01:26:47,027 --> 01:26:48,028
I got the A route.

1431
01:26:48,072 --> 01:26:48,725
Ooh

1432
01:26:48,768 --> 01:26:49,726
and I'm the C.E.O

1433
01:26:49,769 --> 01:26:51,945
Can I drive?

1434
01:26:51,989 --> 01:26:56,123
No, it's very technical machine.

1435
01:26:56,167 --> 01:27:04,167
Yeah I remember, I've driven it
before remember?

1436
01:27:05,176 --> 01:27:07,004
We got big plans for this
company.

1437
01:27:07,047 --> 01:27:08,788
How many trucks you gonna have?

1438
01:27:08,832 --> 01:27:10,853
Two trucks by the end of the year,
we're gonna get Razor in one,

1439
01:27:10,877 --> 01:27:12,227
I'll be in the other.

1440
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:13,358
Yeah get Razor in a truck.

1441
01:27:13,402 --> 01:27:15,099
Maybe I'll get you in a truck.

1442
01:27:15,142 --> 01:27:18,407
I'll sell millions of fish on a
stick.
