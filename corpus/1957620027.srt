1
00:00:01,452 --> 00:00:04,285
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:16,629
(dramatic piano music)

3
00:02:10,836 --> 00:02:13,003
(beeping)

4
00:02:23,874 --> 00:02:26,957
(mechanical ticking)

5
00:02:38,914 --> 00:02:42,081
(jet engines roaring)

6
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:15,176
(beeping)

7
00:03:18,718 --> 00:03:21,635
(tires screeching)

8
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:26,748
- Richter?

9
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,743
What the hell are you doing here?

10
00:03:27,743 --> 00:03:29,122
You're supposed to be on fraud.

11
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:30,436
- Can't a guy go out for some lunch?

12
00:03:30,436 --> 00:03:31,902
- Yeah right, you're just driving around

13
00:03:31,902 --> 00:03:33,751
and you happen to hear
about it on the scanner?

14
00:03:33,751 --> 00:03:36,249
- Brilliant, Lieutenant, you
may make commissioner yet.

15
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,338
- Can it, both of you.

16
00:03:38,338 --> 00:03:39,618
All right, here's the deal.

17
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:41,637
SWAT's on their way, but
they're not gonna do any good,

18
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:43,470
not if these guys are serious.

19
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,020
- Well, what do they want?

20
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,619
- $50 million.

21
00:03:46,619 --> 00:03:49,147
We got a half an hour to get it to 'em.

22
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:51,314
Otherwise, they start tossing out bodies.

23
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,816
- Well, I admire their
notion of feasibility.

24
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:56,441
- They gave us access codes
to accounts in Zurich.

25
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:59,049
This is almost the 21st
century, Detective.

26
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:00,842
- Yeah, but it gets worse.

27
00:04:00,842 --> 00:04:05,495
One of the hostages is a
prince, Ahmad Ali Rasuli.

28
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,610
- [Richter] Prince of what?

29
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,948
- The Republic of Saleh,

30
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:10,842
an oil-rich country the
size of a postage stamp.

31
00:04:10,842 --> 00:04:11,879
They're hoping to get the money

32
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:14,518
from the prince's brother, the sultan.

33
00:04:14,518 --> 00:04:16,435
- Got anything in mind?

34
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:18,947
- Negotiations.

35
00:04:18,947 --> 00:04:21,469
(suspenseful piano music)

36
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,469
- I like it.

37
00:04:25,817 --> 00:04:27,875
(beeping)

38
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,265
- Cellular modem online.

39
00:04:30,265 --> 00:04:32,751
- The miracle of modern technology.

40
00:04:32,751 --> 00:04:35,628
Access Zurich and see if
they've transferred the money.

41
00:04:35,628 --> 00:04:37,545
- Checking as we speak.

42
00:04:40,388 --> 00:04:44,851
- Your brother better
think very highly of you.

43
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,851
- He will pay, trust me.

44
00:04:48,835 --> 00:04:52,242
- [Richter] Hey, you in the plane!

45
00:04:52,242 --> 00:04:53,785
- What the hell?

46
00:04:53,785 --> 00:04:55,118
- Keep checking.

47
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:02,864
Please, don't do anything stupid.

48
00:05:02,864 --> 00:05:06,754
Stefan would love to shoot
each and every one of you.

49
00:05:06,754 --> 00:05:08,921
(gasping)

50
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:12,033
- Just so you know, nobody gets anything

51
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:14,116
until I come in and talk.

52
00:05:17,798 --> 00:05:20,052
- There's nothing to discuss, gentlemen.

53
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:21,924
- Until I come in and see for myself

54
00:05:21,924 --> 00:05:24,266
that all the hostages
are alive and unharmed,

55
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:26,433
nobody gets one damn dime.

56
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:30,673
- All right, strip down to your trousers

57
00:05:30,673 --> 00:05:32,590
and empty your pockets.

58
00:05:33,973 --> 00:05:35,556
- It'll never work.

59
00:05:42,785 --> 00:05:45,266
- Got any better ideas, Lieutenant?

60
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:46,099
- No.

61
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:47,123
- I didn't think so.

62
00:05:47,123 --> 00:05:50,040
So, just let somebody do something.

63
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:11,938
- Hands on your head, nothing cute.

64
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:14,734
Move.

65
00:06:14,734 --> 00:06:16,901
(gasping)

66
00:06:18,764 --> 00:06:22,992
There, you've seen them,
all happy little campers.

67
00:06:22,992 --> 00:06:25,223
Now, what would you say to us

68
00:06:25,223 --> 00:06:28,031
starting the executions a little early?

69
00:06:28,031 --> 00:06:30,050
Bet you didn't count on this.

70
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,664
Any word from the land of chocolate

71
00:06:31,664 --> 00:06:33,528
and unnumbered bank accounts?

72
00:06:33,528 --> 00:06:35,242
- [Woman] Nothing yet.

73
00:06:35,242 --> 00:06:39,766
- It's all right, there's
a little time left.

74
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,933
(beeping)

75
00:06:47,267 --> 00:06:49,617
(screaming)

76
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,561
(gun firing)

77
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:52,894
(screaming)

78
00:06:55,868 --> 00:06:58,285
(gun firing)

79
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:11,417
- He dead?
- He's dead, oh god! (sobbing)

80
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:12,863
- You idiot.

81
00:07:12,863 --> 00:07:14,674
You've ruined everything!

82
00:07:14,674 --> 00:07:15,674
(gun firing)

83
00:07:15,674 --> 00:07:18,007
(screaming)

84
00:07:20,955 --> 00:07:22,710
- Now, there's gratitude for you.

85
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,702
(screaming)

86
00:07:24,702 --> 00:07:25,857
- All right, let's go.

87
00:07:25,857 --> 00:07:26,690
Everybody outta here.

88
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,813
Let's go, move it.

89
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:28,813
- Thank you.

90
00:07:44,017 --> 00:07:46,175
- Next time I come up with
another one of my great ideas,

91
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,622
why don't you go ahead
and shoot me right there

92
00:07:47,622 --> 00:07:49,372
and get it over with?

93
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:00,485
(knocking)

94
00:08:00,485 --> 00:08:02,068
- Mace, come on in.

95
00:08:03,312 --> 00:08:06,312
There's somebody I want you to meet.

96
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:09,200
- Detective Richter,
do you actually intend

97
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,228
to stick by this blatant
crock of a report?

98
00:08:12,228 --> 00:08:13,354
- Captain, I don't understand.

99
00:08:13,354 --> 00:08:14,420
Who is this?

100
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,389
- Charles Patterson, State Department.

101
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:18,950
- I'm here to clean up the crap you spewed

102
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,243
with this afternoon's Wild Bunch routine.

103
00:08:21,243 --> 00:08:22,845
- I got the job done.

104
00:08:22,845 --> 00:08:24,127
What the hell do you want?

105
00:08:24,127 --> 00:08:25,876
- You also got two people killed,

106
00:08:25,876 --> 00:08:27,123
one of which happens to be the brother

107
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:28,819
of Sultan Mohammad Ali Rasuli.

108
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:30,880
- Who was one of the hijackers.

109
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,410
Look, it's in the report.

110
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,787
- You've got quite an
imagination, Detective.

111
00:08:33,787 --> 00:08:37,967
Now you write a book
while you're in prison.

112
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:39,125
- Prison?

113
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,269
- Wait just one minute here,
Patterson, you're not--

114
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:42,953
- Detective Richter will stand trial.

115
00:08:42,953 --> 00:08:45,007
That's the only way to smooth things over.

116
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:47,332
Our relations with this
country are strained already.

117
00:08:47,332 --> 00:08:49,612
Now Detective Richter stands trial.

118
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,579
- Ah, that's bullshit!

119
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:53,578
- That's life.

120
00:08:53,578 --> 00:08:56,245
Captain Hightower, do your duty.

121
00:08:58,298 --> 00:08:59,864
- [Hightower] Hey, wait,
wait, wait one second here.

122
00:08:59,864 --> 00:09:02,631
There's gotta be another way.

123
00:09:02,631 --> 00:09:05,631
- One more word and you go with him.

124
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,215
- Dammit.

125
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:11,880
They're feeding me to the wolves!

126
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,552
- Yeah, all for a couple of lousy gallons

127
00:09:14,552 --> 00:09:17,469
of what used to be a dead dinosaur.

128
00:09:18,873 --> 00:09:20,290
- Son of a bitch.

129
00:09:22,872 --> 00:09:25,895
- I still got some favors up
at the DA's office, all right?

130
00:09:25,895 --> 00:09:30,107
I know what they would advise
you to do: plead guilty.

131
00:09:30,107 --> 00:09:32,733
Just listen to me, okay?

132
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:35,134
You plead guilty, you do
six months in Innsmouth,

133
00:09:35,134 --> 00:09:37,372
maybe then we knock you out
to an honor farm for 60 days.

134
00:09:37,372 --> 00:09:40,914
That's the best we can probably do.

135
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:44,907
- Thanks, Captain, but what about my job?

136
00:09:44,907 --> 00:09:48,096
- We'll blow that bridge
when we get to it.

137
00:09:48,096 --> 00:09:49,013
- Terrific.

138
00:09:54,892 --> 00:09:55,725
- Richard.

139
00:09:56,604 --> 00:09:57,792
Richard, are you home?

140
00:09:57,792 --> 00:10:01,542
- [Richard] Yeah, I'm
upstairs in the office.

141
00:10:08,386 --> 00:10:09,386
- Hi, honey.

142
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:12,443
Working kinda late, aren't we?

143
00:10:12,443 --> 00:10:15,707
- Yeah, big story went down before I left.

144
00:10:15,707 --> 00:10:16,853
The only way I could get the assignment

145
00:10:16,853 --> 00:10:19,568
was to agree to have this done overnight.

146
00:10:19,568 --> 00:10:20,401
- Big?

147
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:21,234
How big is big?

148
00:10:21,234 --> 00:10:22,194
Somebody shoot the mayor?

149
00:10:22,194 --> 00:10:24,418
- No, better than that.

150
00:10:24,418 --> 00:10:27,988
Remember those hijackers that
were sentenced last week?

151
00:10:27,988 --> 00:10:30,690
- Yeah, the ones on the plane, I remember.

152
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,555
- Yeah, well someone busted them out.

153
00:10:33,555 --> 00:10:35,469
Real shoot-em-up stuff.

154
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:38,969
(uneasy orchestral music)

155
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,311
- This Murdock character,

156
00:10:41,311 --> 00:10:43,408
isn't he the one you
roasted during the trial?

157
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:46,046
- Yeah, and he's gonna
make us a lot more money.

158
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:48,018
Look, Gail, could you go downstairs,

159
00:10:48,018 --> 00:10:49,699
put the groceries away, something?

160
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:52,931
I really need to finish
this article, okay?

161
00:10:52,931 --> 00:10:55,620
- You give me 20 minutes
and I will give you

162
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,037
two hours of peace and quiet.

163
00:11:00,856 --> 00:11:03,294
- Oh, the things I do to get ahead.

164
00:11:03,294 --> 00:11:06,461
(soft romantic music)

165
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:36,058
Hey.

166
00:11:36,058 --> 00:11:36,891
Hey!

167
00:11:36,891 --> 00:11:41,827
(gun firing)
(screaming)

168
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:44,744
- I told you not to write about me.

169
00:11:56,261 --> 00:11:59,511
But I guess this evens things out some.

170
00:12:01,152 --> 00:12:01,985
Thanks.

171
00:12:15,197 --> 00:12:18,250
- Amidst the frenzy of
public outcry, budget woes,

172
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,524
and design and construction snafus,

173
00:12:20,524 --> 00:12:22,535
Innsmouth's federal penitentiary

174
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:25,897
is finally due to go online
almost a year behind schedule.

175
00:12:25,897 --> 00:12:26,892
- Are these the new prisoners?

176
00:12:26,892 --> 00:12:27,725
- Yeah.

177
00:12:27,725 --> 00:12:28,767
- Okay, you're clear to go.

178
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:30,508
Open the gate.

179
00:12:30,508 --> 00:12:32,299
- Even though Innsmouth Prison's

180
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:34,732
formal opening is still days away,

181
00:12:34,732 --> 00:12:36,454
prisoners are beginning to be transferred

182
00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:39,204
from the Los Angeles County Jail.

183
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,988
- All right, come on.

184
00:12:59,964 --> 00:13:02,463
Come on, you know the drill.

185
00:13:02,463 --> 00:13:03,813
All right, come on.

186
00:13:03,813 --> 00:13:04,646
Come on.

187
00:13:18,623 --> 00:13:20,290
Come on, step it up.

188
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:26,771
Come on, move it!

189
00:13:30,763 --> 00:13:31,596
All right.

190
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:35,481
You, right here, face front.

191
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,667
You, right there.

192
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,417
You, right over here.

193
00:13:40,546 --> 00:13:41,963
You, right there.

194
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:45,521
I got a special place for you.

195
00:13:48,534 --> 00:13:51,664
- These first five
consist of Glen Jackson,

196
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,922
the self-described patriot
whose near-successful attempt

197
00:13:54,922 --> 00:13:57,383
at blowing up the IRS' main computer

198
00:13:57,383 --> 00:13:59,633
earned him a 20-year stint.

199
00:14:00,853 --> 00:14:04,560
Harrison Edward O'Reilly
III, the famous S&L bandit

200
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,564
currently serving 15 years

201
00:14:06,564 --> 00:14:10,731
for his masterminding the
national savings scheme.

202
00:14:11,716 --> 00:14:15,216
Jesus Gonzalez, kidnapper, doing 15 years.

203
00:14:17,131 --> 00:14:21,157
Carl Croaker, doing 10 years
for second-degree murder.

204
00:14:21,157 --> 00:14:24,291
And lastly, Mason Richter,
the police officer

205
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:27,430
convicted of the wrongful
deaths of two persons

206
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,051
stemming from the terrorist hijacking

207
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:31,139
of Flight 544 out of LAX.

208
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:34,139
(door lock buzzing)

209
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:36,862
- This place gives me the creeps.

210
00:14:36,862 --> 00:14:38,279
- I know, me too.

211
00:14:42,284 --> 00:14:43,743
- Set up right here?

212
00:14:43,743 --> 00:14:45,725
- Yeah, right over there's good.

213
00:14:45,725 --> 00:14:46,558
Great.

214
00:14:48,505 --> 00:14:50,138
- [Jeff] Rolling.

215
00:14:50,138 --> 00:14:51,571
- I'm Tracy Quinn.

216
00:14:51,571 --> 00:14:54,374
Come along as we tour
this high-tech facility

217
00:14:54,374 --> 00:14:56,617
and perhaps chat one-on-one

218
00:14:56,617 --> 00:14:59,151
with some of the deadliest men alive,

219
00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:03,318
coming up live for the next
hour on American Encounters.

220
00:15:04,786 --> 00:15:06,139
Okay, cut.

221
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,579
- Perfect, babe, beautiful.

222
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:10,132
- Look, I can't tell an audience
we're live when we're not.

223
00:15:10,132 --> 00:15:11,306
- Nobody'll know the difference.

224
00:15:11,306 --> 00:15:14,806
(mechanical door opening)

225
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:20,001
- Ladies and gentlemen, if I
may please have your attention.

226
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:22,971
I'm William Glover, the
warden of Innsmouth Prison.

227
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:25,098
It's a pleasure to have you here today.

228
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:26,903
We'll begin by showing you the grounds.

229
00:15:26,903 --> 00:15:29,113
- Warden, how do you feel about having

230
00:15:29,113 --> 00:15:30,958
hundreds of murderers and rapists

231
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,433
in the middle of a major metropolis?

232
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,977
- Well, I understand your concern.

233
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:36,223
But if you'll bear with me--

234
00:15:36,223 --> 00:15:38,604
- [Chapel] Do you have a family, Warden?

235
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,854
- I have a wife and two
children, both daughters.

236
00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:45,835
They do, in fact, live
here in Los Angeles.

237
00:15:45,835 --> 00:15:47,742
That should tell you how confident I am

238
00:15:47,742 --> 00:15:50,052
in the integrity of this facility.

239
00:15:50,052 --> 00:15:51,969
Now, let's get started.

240
00:15:52,991 --> 00:15:55,063
If you'll follow me.

241
00:15:55,063 --> 00:15:55,965
If you look around,

242
00:15:55,965 --> 00:15:59,199
you'll see that these
cells are state-of-the-art.

243
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,165
No bars, just steel doors
with Lexan viewing ports.

244
00:16:03,165 --> 00:16:05,950
- Well, can the prisoners
talk to one another?

245
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,617
- Miss Quinn, is it?

246
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,673
We prefer the term guest to prisoner.

247
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:14,933
If you look at the floor by each door,

248
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,232
you'll notice a steel wedge

249
00:16:16,232 --> 00:16:18,733
so that contraband can't
be passed back and forth,

250
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:21,857
but this is by no means soundproof.

251
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:24,097
- There doesn't seem to be any privacy.

252
00:16:24,097 --> 00:16:27,658
Doesn't that constitute
cruel and unusual punishment?

253
00:16:27,658 --> 00:16:29,932
- Well, not as such.

254
00:16:29,932 --> 00:16:32,455
But all that aside, the prison authority

255
00:16:32,455 --> 00:16:34,393
has decided to keep in
step with the times,

256
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:37,001
as far as rehabilitation is concerned.

257
00:16:37,001 --> 00:16:38,569
The days of dishwashing

258
00:16:38,569 --> 00:16:41,274
and making license plate frames are over.

259
00:16:41,274 --> 00:16:45,114
We teach literacy, computer
science, and other career skills

260
00:16:45,114 --> 00:16:48,697
that will carry them
into the 21st century.

261
00:16:52,426 --> 00:16:53,762
- Nice dodge.

262
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:54,595
- I know.

263
00:17:05,696 --> 00:17:06,929
- What's in the truck?

264
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:08,287
- Just some food and things.

265
00:17:08,287 --> 00:17:10,148
- Okay, pull inside, I gotta check it out.

266
00:17:10,148 --> 00:17:11,315
Open the gate.

267
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:40,164
Sorry, I gotta check the back.

268
00:17:40,164 --> 00:17:41,831
- I figured as much.

269
00:17:44,445 --> 00:17:46,862
(gun firing)

270
00:18:22,694 --> 00:18:25,277
- Close the front gate, please.

271
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:34,361
- So, as you can see,

272
00:18:34,361 --> 00:18:36,788
this infirmary will have most
of the advanced equipment

273
00:18:36,788 --> 00:18:38,754
you can find in any hospital.

274
00:18:38,754 --> 00:18:40,796
There'll be X-ray and MRI machines,

275
00:18:40,796 --> 00:18:44,945
as well as hot tubs,
sitz baths and so forth.

276
00:18:44,945 --> 00:18:45,895
- [Reporter] Come on, Warden.

277
00:18:45,895 --> 00:18:49,293
I mean, isn't this just
another form of loafing?

278
00:18:49,293 --> 00:18:50,828
Where's the value in this?

279
00:18:50,828 --> 00:18:53,224
How does this help society?

280
00:18:53,224 --> 00:18:54,278
- Fiscally.

281
00:18:54,278 --> 00:18:57,774
By employing our staff
of resident physicians,

282
00:18:57,774 --> 00:18:59,915
we can keep the state's
cost of guest treatment

283
00:18:59,915 --> 00:19:01,267
to a fraction of what it would be

284
00:19:01,267 --> 00:19:03,961
if we transferred them to a hospital.

285
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:07,413
To boot, leading experts
agree that a healthy body

286
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:10,205
is the quickest route to a healthy mind,

287
00:19:10,205 --> 00:19:14,122
and a healthier mind is
easier to rehabilitate.

288
00:19:15,374 --> 00:19:18,980
- Well, I hope your experts
are correct, Warden.

289
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:22,162
I mean, it would be a shame
if innocent people had to die

290
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:23,829
to prove them wrong.

291
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,855
- Who are you, sir?

292
00:19:26,855 --> 00:19:29,855
What media service do you represent?

293
00:19:31,157 --> 00:19:34,053
- Harry Chapel, Independent Herald.

294
00:19:34,053 --> 00:19:35,303
- I thought so.

295
00:19:36,993 --> 00:19:41,534
Mr. Chapel, if you'd like to
represent your scandal sheet

296
00:19:41,534 --> 00:19:45,087
for the duration of this
tour, I suggest you keep

297
00:19:45,087 --> 00:19:49,407
your snide remarks and asides to yourself.

298
00:19:49,407 --> 00:19:50,240
Very well.

299
00:19:51,686 --> 00:19:54,269
Onward and upward, as they say.

300
00:19:57,342 --> 00:19:58,921
- [Jeff] That was fun.

301
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:01,308
- Take a good look at that guy, Chapel.

302
00:20:01,308 --> 00:20:02,656
- [Jeff] Why?

303
00:20:02,656 --> 00:20:04,124
- [Tracy] I used to
work for the Independent

304
00:20:04,124 --> 00:20:05,990
and I don't recognize him.

305
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,010
- [Jeff] Maybe he's a newbie.

306
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,528
- (laughing) And maybe I'm the Pope.

307
00:20:09,528 --> 00:20:10,876
- No chance of that.

308
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,462
You'd look funny in that pointy hat.

309
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,712
(laughing)

310
00:20:19,245 --> 00:20:20,078
Here we go.

311
00:20:20,078 --> 00:20:22,245
- [Tracy] Well, all right.

312
00:21:00,648 --> 00:21:02,636
- Hey, fat boy, why don't
you take the top bunk?

313
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,376
I'm afraid of heights.

314
00:21:04,376 --> 00:21:05,588
- No, I don't think so.

315
00:21:05,588 --> 00:21:06,996
I like this just fine.

316
00:21:06,996 --> 00:21:09,052
- Ah, your mother's a whore.

317
00:21:09,052 --> 00:21:09,885
- Sure,

318
00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:14,052
but she learned everything she
knows from yours. (laughing)

319
00:21:18,301 --> 00:21:23,213
- [Jackson] Baby, I've got
what you need. (laughing)

320
00:21:23,213 --> 00:21:24,922
- Hey, hey Jackson, what is it?

321
00:21:24,922 --> 00:21:26,893
- Well, it ain't your mama, Kojak.

322
00:21:26,893 --> 00:21:28,833
- [Jesus] No, but she can be my mama.

323
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,026
- Richter, do you see her?!

324
00:21:31,026 --> 00:21:32,578
- Nope.

325
00:21:32,578 --> 00:21:34,895
- [Carl] I can't see
anything from in here!

326
00:21:34,895 --> 00:21:38,062
- You guys have been in here too long.

327
00:21:41,841 --> 00:21:43,713
- They're coming back in.

328
00:21:43,713 --> 00:21:46,242
- [Harrison] You want some breath spray?

329
00:21:46,242 --> 00:21:47,075
- Shut up.

330
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,858
- While the exterior may seem no different

331
00:21:54,858 --> 00:21:56,614
from any other prison,

332
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:59,564
its walls contain
sophisticated soundproofing

333
00:21:59,564 --> 00:22:02,481
and other noise-baffling materials.

334
00:22:02,481 --> 00:22:03,674
Not that it'll ever happen here,

335
00:22:03,674 --> 00:22:06,632
but a full-scale riot could
occur within these walls

336
00:22:06,632 --> 00:22:08,412
and the neighbors wouldn't even know it.

337
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:09,764
- How thoughtful.

338
00:22:09,764 --> 00:22:11,259
- If you'd like to
continue your tour inside,

339
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:13,176
I'll be right with you.

340
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,351
Hey gatehouse, this is Warden Glover.

341
00:22:22,351 --> 00:22:23,351
Acknowledge.

342
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,165
- Front gate, go ahead.

343
00:22:27,165 --> 00:22:29,681
- What's this truck doing back here?

344
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,297
- [Gate Guard] Early
delivery, kitchen supplies.

345
00:22:31,297 --> 00:22:34,938
Checked it out personally;
everything looks fine, sir.

346
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:36,355
- Fine, carry on.

347
00:22:40,546 --> 00:22:41,796
- Dumb bastard.

348
00:23:16,543 --> 00:23:20,521
- Hey, you guys can't
bring that stuff in here.

349
00:23:20,521 --> 00:23:22,673
- Our supervisor told us to.

350
00:23:22,673 --> 00:23:25,340
- Oh yeah, well what's his name?

351
00:23:27,902 --> 00:23:29,485
- Okay, you got me.

352
00:23:30,384 --> 00:23:31,217
I'm lying.

353
00:23:33,303 --> 00:23:35,720
(gun firing)

354
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:45,656
- As you can see, this area
is solitary confinement.

355
00:23:45,656 --> 00:23:47,129
- Warden, would it be possible

356
00:23:47,129 --> 00:23:49,129
to visit the prisoners on-site?

357
00:23:49,129 --> 00:23:53,569
- The guests aren't monkeys
for you to toss bananas to.

358
00:23:53,569 --> 00:23:54,946
- How'd that politically correct asshole

359
00:23:54,946 --> 00:23:57,315
ever get to be warden?

360
00:23:57,315 --> 00:23:59,309
- [Tracy] I'm sorry I asked.

361
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:00,925
- I'm getting used to it.

362
00:24:00,925 --> 00:24:02,425
Follow me, please.

363
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:08,446
This is the administrative area.

364
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,378
There are over 50 separate offices

365
00:24:10,378 --> 00:24:13,569
and twice that number of work cubicles.

366
00:24:13,569 --> 00:24:17,377
- Well, I guess a person could
live pretty comfortably here.

367
00:24:17,377 --> 00:24:18,335
- Cute.

368
00:24:18,335 --> 00:24:19,543
- This is all well and good, Warden,

369
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:21,039
but what about the anti-escape measures

370
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,857
we've all heard so much about?

371
00:24:22,857 --> 00:24:25,159
- I'm not about to give
up all our secrets.

372
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:27,422
After all, a machine
designed by a human mind

373
00:24:27,422 --> 00:24:29,498
can be defeated by a human mind.

374
00:24:29,498 --> 00:24:34,383
But I will tell you this:
Innsmouth is quite secure.

375
00:24:34,383 --> 00:24:36,101
That concludes our tour.

376
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:38,210
- Great, what about the grub?

377
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,177
- Excuse me?

378
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:40,010
- What the hell, man?

379
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,452
I mean, half-a-billion
bucks into this monstrosity

380
00:24:42,452 --> 00:24:45,085
and you guys can't spring
for a couple of carrot sticks

381
00:24:45,085 --> 00:24:47,298
and some watery punch?

382
00:24:47,298 --> 00:24:49,059
- Thank you for your time.

383
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:50,019
- [Chapel] Christ.

384
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:51,352
- Warden Glover.

385
00:24:54,257 --> 00:24:55,090
Wait.

386
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:03,213
Warden Glover, wait.

387
00:25:03,213 --> 00:25:04,462
Wait!

388
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:07,712
(dramatic piano music)

389
00:25:28,258 --> 00:25:30,487
- No, Miss Quinn, you absolutely cannot

390
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,772
speak with the guests.

391
00:25:31,772 --> 00:25:33,362
Now, if you will excuse me--

392
00:25:33,362 --> 00:25:36,352
- Look, that's not exactly
what I had in mind.

393
00:25:36,352 --> 00:25:38,316
- I'm afraid I don't understand.

394
00:25:38,316 --> 00:25:42,904
- I'd like a few moments of
your time, with just you.

395
00:25:42,904 --> 00:25:44,447
- Me?

396
00:25:44,447 --> 00:25:45,602
Why?

397
00:25:45,602 --> 00:25:47,347
- Well, I think the
public would like to know

398
00:25:47,347 --> 00:25:49,590
about the man behind the machine.

399
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,667
I mean, you seem like an interesting guy,

400
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:55,978
not the usual hanging judge type.

401
00:25:55,978 --> 00:25:58,361
- Well, I really don't like the limelight,

402
00:25:58,361 --> 00:26:01,000
but in the interest of public information,

403
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,231
I suppose I could spare a few minutes.

404
00:26:03,231 --> 00:26:04,723
- (laughing) Great.

405
00:26:04,723 --> 00:26:07,556
- Come with me, I know a shortcut.

406
00:26:10,721 --> 00:26:12,451
- You devious wench.

407
00:26:12,451 --> 00:26:16,451
- I'm gonna interview
those guys if it kills me.

408
00:26:28,396 --> 00:26:31,925
- Well, looks like the last
of the reporters just split.

409
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:34,312
- I'm glad this PR crap is over with.

410
00:26:34,312 --> 00:26:36,814
Now things can get back
to normal around here.

411
00:26:36,814 --> 00:26:38,731
- You said it, brother.

412
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,604
(gun firing)

413
00:27:06,183 --> 00:27:10,350
- You really don't wanna make
my life difficult, do you?

414
00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:14,342
That's great.

415
00:27:16,342 --> 00:27:20,509
(gun firing)
(screaming)

416
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,552
- Actually, I was interviewed
once before, you know.

417
00:27:46,552 --> 00:27:47,997
- No, I didn't know that.

418
00:27:47,997 --> 00:27:51,422
- Yes, it was back when I was a lawyer.

419
00:27:51,422 --> 00:27:55,432
I got a 30-second spot
on KTZZ News in Oxnard.

420
00:27:55,432 --> 00:27:58,099
- A whole 30 seconds, huh?
- Mmm.

421
00:28:00,113 --> 00:28:01,416
Let's go to the main control room.

422
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:02,440
We can talk more there.

423
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,540
It'll make for a more interesting
backdrop than my office.

424
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,782
- [Tracy] Okay, great.

425
00:28:05,782 --> 00:28:07,523
- So, I really want you to see this.

426
00:28:07,523 --> 00:28:09,740
This is our central control room,

427
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:13,840
the very heart, very core of the prison.

428
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,988
Everything happens from here.

429
00:28:14,988 --> 00:28:19,375
These screens, these
switches, these controls

430
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:21,147
oversee the entire operation.

431
00:28:21,147 --> 00:28:24,864
- Warden Glover and
company, so good to see you.

432
00:28:24,864 --> 00:28:26,475
Please, make yourselves comfortable.

433
00:28:26,475 --> 00:28:29,540
We have so much to
discuss in a short time.

434
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,845
- Not much chance of you
being the Pope, now is there?

435
00:28:31,845 --> 00:28:36,012
- [Murdock] Stefan, would you
call for the truck, please?

436
00:28:52,213 --> 00:28:53,273
- We're secure.

437
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,376
Send in the delivery.

438
00:28:55,376 --> 00:28:57,126
- [Gate Guard] Roger.

439
00:29:09,175 --> 00:29:12,099
- Warden Glover, I would
prefer not to go through

440
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:16,266
a lengthy Q-and-A session, so
if you would kindly provide

441
00:29:17,258 --> 00:29:21,510
the master override
computer control codes,

442
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:25,814
we'll be in and out
with a minimum of fuss.

443
00:29:25,814 --> 00:29:27,155
- I can't give them to you.

444
00:29:27,155 --> 00:29:27,988
Why would you want--

445
00:29:27,988 --> 00:29:30,821
- This is what I meant by lengthy.

446
00:29:32,289 --> 00:29:34,435
Perhaps it would help if we shot

447
00:29:34,435 --> 00:29:37,352
this lovely young lady in the head.

448
00:29:39,995 --> 00:29:41,653
- You don't understand.

449
00:29:41,653 --> 00:29:45,372
It would mean my job and
the prison's security.

450
00:29:45,372 --> 00:29:47,955
- Your job or this lady's life.

451
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,283
- I can't do it!

452
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:06,074
- You'd sacrifice another human being

453
00:30:06,074 --> 00:30:09,907
just to keep your wretched
pencil-pushing job?

454
00:30:11,221 --> 00:30:13,543
(gun firing)
(screaming)

455
00:30:13,543 --> 00:30:15,793
(laughing)

456
00:30:16,747 --> 00:30:18,580
I despise bureaucrats.

457
00:30:21,705 --> 00:30:24,352
Bear in mind, you have another hand

458
00:30:24,352 --> 00:30:26,435
and two elbows and knees,

459
00:30:27,557 --> 00:30:30,974
and I have three times that many bullets.

460
00:30:34,618 --> 00:30:35,451
- Three,

461
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,467
three,

462
00:30:38,467 --> 00:30:39,300
two,

463
00:30:40,526 --> 00:30:41,359
seven,

464
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:42,192
seven.

465
00:30:43,524 --> 00:30:46,357
- There, that wasn't so difficult.

466
00:30:52,644 --> 00:30:53,644
Punch it in.

467
00:30:57,358 --> 00:30:59,296
(beeping)

468
00:30:59,296 --> 00:31:01,852
All points of entry and exit are secured.

469
00:31:01,852 --> 00:31:03,429
The prison is yours.

470
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:05,179
- What are you up to?

471
00:31:06,237 --> 00:31:08,982
- Exactly what are we up to?

472
00:31:08,982 --> 00:31:09,815
Stefan?

473
00:31:10,751 --> 00:31:12,360
- The end of the world.

474
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,742
- And lucky you, you have a front row seat

475
00:31:15,742 --> 00:31:19,909
and you didn't even have
to pay for it. (laughing)

476
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,588
Make sure our guests,
that is the correct term,

477
00:31:57,588 --> 00:32:01,755
isn't it, Warden Glover,
are comfortable and docile.

478
00:32:02,824 --> 00:32:03,980
- It's about time.

479
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,969
It's gonna be a pleasure
to see Richter again.

480
00:32:05,969 --> 00:32:07,219
- Mace Richter?

481
00:32:09,031 --> 00:32:12,341
What are you doing, breaking him out?

482
00:32:12,341 --> 00:32:16,151
- Yeah, we're breaking
his soul out of his body.

483
00:32:16,151 --> 00:32:18,662
- Didn't you pay attention a moment ago?

484
00:32:18,662 --> 00:32:20,578
Richter's a bonus.

485
00:32:20,578 --> 00:32:22,021
We're here to get the Fourth of July

486
00:32:22,021 --> 00:32:24,188
off to a very early start.

487
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:43,864
- Come on, hurry it up.

488
00:32:43,864 --> 00:32:47,114
(dramatic piano music)

489
00:33:33,695 --> 00:33:35,556
- Let me bind his hand.

490
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:37,163
- No way.

491
00:33:37,163 --> 00:33:38,633
- He's gonna bleed to death.

492
00:33:38,633 --> 00:33:39,520
- What do you care?

493
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,088
A minute ago, he was gonna
let the skirt get shot.

494
00:33:42,088 --> 00:33:45,838
- Look, I am not a skirt,
you son of a bitch.

495
00:33:46,951 --> 00:33:49,516
- What the hell, do it.

496
00:33:49,516 --> 00:33:50,683
- [Jeff] Here.

497
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:03,180
- I can't believe you were
gonna let them shoot me.

498
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,948
- Well, it was nothing personal.

499
00:34:04,948 --> 00:34:07,762
- Yeah, well I'm sure my mother
would've kept that in mind

500
00:34:07,762 --> 00:34:10,294
when she was shopping for a black dress.

501
00:34:10,294 --> 00:34:11,604
- You know, it'd be a damn shame

502
00:34:11,604 --> 00:34:14,104
to let you go to waste, honey.

503
00:34:15,538 --> 00:34:17,038
- Leave her alone.

504
00:34:18,729 --> 00:34:20,812
- Who are you, my keeper?

505
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,133
Come here, baby.

506
00:34:28,052 --> 00:34:30,385
(screaming)

507
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:33,000
- No!

508
00:34:35,326 --> 00:34:36,607
(gun firing)
(screaming)

509
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:37,440
Jeff!

510
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:41,409
(groaning)

511
00:34:43,997 --> 00:34:44,830
Jeff!

512
00:34:46,078 --> 00:34:48,245
(sobbing)

513
00:34:49,264 --> 00:34:50,847
- Come on, come on.

514
00:34:58,191 --> 00:34:59,024
Come on!

515
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,713
(beeping)

516
00:35:08,713 --> 00:35:09,546
Is it?

517
00:35:16,005 --> 00:35:19,739
- Don't trip unless you
wanna glow in the dark.

518
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:22,739
Mmm, Katya, my dear, timely as ever.

519
00:35:24,217 --> 00:35:27,050
- Was there ever any doubt, lover?

520
00:35:33,721 --> 00:35:35,119
- Get to work.

521
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,202
I want the timer rigged

522
00:35:36,202 --> 00:35:38,603
and our asses outta here in two hours.

523
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,430
- It's gonna take a little while.

524
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,513
- Just do it.

525
00:35:49,084 --> 00:35:51,999
(beeping)

526
00:35:51,999 --> 00:35:53,166
- There it is.

527
00:35:57,465 --> 00:35:59,132
Miss Quinn, help me!

528
00:36:02,209 --> 00:36:03,876
Miss Quinn, help me!

529
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:16,012
I need you to type the password
for fire emergency release.

530
00:36:16,012 --> 00:36:16,845
Type A,

531
00:36:18,563 --> 00:36:19,396
slash,

532
00:36:20,498 --> 00:36:22,062
semicolon,

533
00:36:22,062 --> 00:36:23,326
three, two, one.

534
00:36:23,326 --> 00:36:25,493
(beeping)

535
00:36:29,463 --> 00:36:32,408
(door locks buzzing)

536
00:36:32,408 --> 00:36:34,043
- Well, what did we just do?

537
00:36:34,043 --> 00:36:35,867
- We opened every door in the place.

538
00:36:35,867 --> 00:36:37,284
- It's open, man!

539
00:36:39,788 --> 00:36:41,802
- Dammit, it's always something.

540
00:36:41,802 --> 00:36:44,878
You keep after it; I don't
give a damn what happens.

541
00:36:44,878 --> 00:36:46,449
- We'll take a shortcut to the main gate,

542
00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:47,282
get out from there.

543
00:36:47,282 --> 00:36:48,699
- Well, let's go!

544
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,484
- It's gotta be a fire or
something, man, it's a fire!

545
00:36:53,484 --> 00:36:54,841
- That's cool, let's ride.

546
00:36:54,841 --> 00:36:56,123
- And if it's only a malfunction,

547
00:36:56,123 --> 00:36:57,872
then we get shot by the turnkeys.

548
00:36:57,872 --> 00:36:59,740
- I ain't cooking my off in here.

549
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,675
- May I suggest that we
investigate this carefully?

550
00:37:02,675 --> 00:37:05,114
- Yeah, that's the best
advice I've heard yet.

551
00:37:05,114 --> 00:37:06,197
Let's hit it.

552
00:37:12,393 --> 00:37:14,019
- Command core, come in.

553
00:37:14,019 --> 00:37:15,424
Respond.

554
00:37:15,424 --> 00:37:17,485
All teams seal off the main exits.

555
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,068
Do not let the hostages escape.

556
00:37:28,142 --> 00:37:28,975
- Man.

557
00:37:31,884 --> 00:37:33,000
Murdock.

558
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,898
- Go ahead.

559
00:37:33,898 --> 00:37:35,422
- [Stefan] The prisoners are loose.

560
00:37:35,422 --> 00:37:36,400
- Say again?

561
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,573
- The doors are open; they're gone.

562
00:37:38,573 --> 00:37:39,614
- Richter.

563
00:37:39,614 --> 00:37:41,209
Son of a bitch.

564
00:37:41,209 --> 00:37:43,174
Why don't you go to
command core immediately?

565
00:37:43,174 --> 00:37:44,344
- I'm gonna go look for him.

566
00:37:44,344 --> 00:37:45,787
- You follow orders!

567
00:37:45,787 --> 00:37:47,250
Command core, now.

568
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:50,500
Shoot anyone unfamiliar to you, anyone!

569
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:58,779
- Hey, what the hell's going on up there?

570
00:37:58,779 --> 00:38:00,709
- Look at that.

571
00:38:00,709 --> 00:38:03,209
(guns firing)

572
00:38:09,146 --> 00:38:09,979
- Move!

573
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:12,592
- Get 'em!

574
00:38:12,592 --> 00:38:13,592
- I'm on it.

575
00:38:17,029 --> 00:38:18,264
- I think this way, man.

576
00:38:18,264 --> 00:38:19,347
Go over here!

577
00:38:25,315 --> 00:38:26,482
This way, man.

578
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:35,545
Turn around!

579
00:38:53,633 --> 00:38:55,215
- This is John.

580
00:38:55,215 --> 00:38:56,444
I lost their trail.

581
00:38:56,444 --> 00:38:57,564
I'm coming back.

582
00:38:57,564 --> 00:38:58,397
Out.

583
00:39:03,485 --> 00:39:04,318
Hold it!

584
00:39:07,327 --> 00:39:09,193
All right, let's go.

585
00:39:09,193 --> 00:39:10,026
Turn around!

586
00:39:10,026 --> 00:39:10,859
- Take it easy, pal.

587
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:11,955
- Turn around!

588
00:39:11,955 --> 00:39:13,872
- All right, all right.

589
00:39:15,965 --> 00:39:18,215
(groaning)

590
00:39:30,355 --> 00:39:32,605
(snapping)

591
00:39:41,956 --> 00:39:42,789
Croaker!

592
00:40:02,962 --> 00:40:06,158
- What the hell happened to you?

593
00:40:06,158 --> 00:40:08,357
- Boyfriend sucker punched me.

594
00:40:08,357 --> 00:40:09,607
- Jesus Christ.

595
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:14,347
They did something to the system, fix it.

596
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:19,414
- Well, how can I do that when
I don't know what they did?

597
00:40:21,562 --> 00:40:22,562
- Be clever.

598
00:40:26,867 --> 00:40:29,470
(screaming)

599
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,431
- Help me!

600
00:40:30,431 --> 00:40:31,931
Damn you, help me!

601
00:40:32,987 --> 00:40:34,487
Damn you, help me!

602
00:40:35,385 --> 00:40:37,294
- Come on baby, fight me baby, come on!

603
00:40:37,294 --> 00:40:38,742
- Help me.
- Come on, baby.

604
00:40:38,742 --> 00:40:40,394
Fight me baby, come on!

605
00:40:40,394 --> 00:40:41,644
- Let go of me.

606
00:40:43,819 --> 00:40:46,069
(groaning)

607
00:40:56,042 --> 00:40:58,625
- For god sakes, open the gate!

608
00:41:01,783 --> 00:41:03,090
- What's the problem, Warden?

609
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:04,066
- Are you blind?

610
00:41:04,066 --> 00:41:05,541
The prison's under attack!

611
00:41:05,541 --> 00:41:08,123
- Yeah, I've been watching it on TV.

612
00:41:08,123 --> 00:41:09,327
Ain't it a bitch?

613
00:41:09,327 --> 00:41:13,494
(gun firing)
(groaning)

614
00:41:25,959 --> 00:41:26,844
- Speed it up, kid.

615
00:41:26,844 --> 00:41:28,973
We can't let the mice
off the sinking ship.

616
00:41:28,973 --> 00:41:30,223
- I'm hurrying!

617
00:41:31,649 --> 00:41:32,732
I'm hurrying.

618
00:41:41,462 --> 00:41:42,295
Done.

619
00:41:43,957 --> 00:41:45,040
We're secure.

620
00:41:58,781 --> 00:42:00,747
- Congratulations.

621
00:42:00,747 --> 00:42:01,997
Get the crates.

622
00:42:18,133 --> 00:42:19,940
- That's it.

623
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,594
That's it.

624
00:42:21,594 --> 00:42:22,427
That's it.

625
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,423
That's it.

626
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:29,492
Now you're gonna get what's
coming to you, bitch.

627
00:42:31,002 --> 00:42:32,195
(groaning)

628
00:42:32,195 --> 00:42:35,085
- I think you got that
just backwards, pal.

629
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:37,418
(straining)

630
00:42:59,902 --> 00:43:02,152
(groaning)

631
00:43:18,383 --> 00:43:19,883
- It's cool, jefe.

632
00:43:24,489 --> 00:43:25,822
- You all right?

633
00:43:41,573 --> 00:43:42,991
- You all right, pal?

634
00:43:42,991 --> 00:43:45,028
- Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

635
00:43:45,028 --> 00:43:46,641
- Let's join the rest of the bird gang.

636
00:43:46,641 --> 00:43:50,074
- Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea.

637
00:43:50,074 --> 00:43:51,074
- Come here.

638
00:43:51,934 --> 00:43:53,752
- Look, it's all right.

639
00:43:53,752 --> 00:43:55,194
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?

640
00:43:55,194 --> 00:43:56,027
Please.

641
00:44:02,358 --> 00:44:03,477
What's your name?

642
00:44:03,477 --> 00:44:04,310
- Tracy.

643
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,234
Tracy Quinn.

644
00:44:05,234 --> 00:44:07,197
- What the hell are you doing in here?

645
00:44:07,197 --> 00:44:08,030
- I'm a journalist.

646
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:10,033
A bunch of us were taking a tour.

647
00:44:10,033 --> 00:44:11,740
- What can you tell me
about what's been going on?

648
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:14,552
- Look, all I know is a bunch
of armed guys stormed in.

649
00:44:14,552 --> 00:44:17,783
They killed my cameraman, Jeff,
and a couple other people.

650
00:44:17,783 --> 00:44:19,567
- Yeah, well how many did you see?

651
00:44:19,567 --> 00:44:21,734
- I don't know, maybe six?

652
00:44:22,805 --> 00:44:24,813
- No, no, I wouldn't
try to take this place

653
00:44:24,813 --> 00:44:26,578
with less than 10.

654
00:44:26,578 --> 00:44:29,820
Well, welcome to Club Fed, Tracy.

655
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:32,574
Better get some ice on that eye.

656
00:44:32,574 --> 00:44:33,407
And you.

657
00:44:34,298 --> 00:44:36,855
You just be glad that
you're worth more to me

658
00:44:36,855 --> 00:44:38,425
alive than dead right now.

659
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:39,340
- Yeah?

660
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:42,101
You just put the gun down
and we'll see, big shot.

661
00:44:42,101 --> 00:44:44,295
- There was one other guy.

662
00:44:44,295 --> 00:44:49,244
The leader radioed him before
he left with this biker guy.

663
00:44:49,244 --> 00:44:51,972
- What, white supremacist maybe?

664
00:44:51,972 --> 00:44:53,468
- Maybe.

665
00:44:53,468 --> 00:44:57,635
No, he had a very icy look
with a nasty scar on his face.

666
00:44:59,084 --> 00:45:01,728
I think his name was Stephen or--

667
00:45:01,728 --> 00:45:02,561
- [Richter] Stefan?

668
00:45:02,561 --> 00:45:03,577
- [Tracy] Yeah, that was it.

669
00:45:03,577 --> 00:45:04,738
- And the guy giving the orders,

670
00:45:04,738 --> 00:45:06,393
what exactly did he look like?

671
00:45:06,393 --> 00:45:11,358
- He was tall, about six feet
maybe, with grayish hair.

672
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:12,942
His name was--

673
00:45:12,942 --> 00:45:13,775
- Murdock.

674
00:45:14,906 --> 00:45:16,369
Son of a bitch.

675
00:45:16,369 --> 00:45:18,056
- What, you know these jotos?

676
00:45:18,056 --> 00:45:19,912
- Yeah, we've met.

677
00:45:19,912 --> 00:45:21,140
And chances are he knows

678
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,611
we're running around here loose too,

679
00:45:22,611 --> 00:45:24,807
so we better continue this
conversation somewhere else.

680
00:45:24,807 --> 00:45:25,640
- No way, man.

681
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,677
We gotta get outta here.

682
00:45:26,677 --> 00:45:27,538
- It's too late.

683
00:45:27,538 --> 00:45:30,161
They've already relocked all of the doors.

684
00:45:30,161 --> 00:45:32,874
- That's great, we're dead.

685
00:45:32,874 --> 00:45:35,646
- No, not if we play our cards right.

686
00:45:35,646 --> 00:45:37,313
All right, let's go.

687
00:45:42,121 --> 00:45:43,621
- Where you going?

688
00:45:43,621 --> 00:45:44,917
- This way.

689
00:45:44,917 --> 00:45:47,136
- This way.
- That way, this way.

690
00:45:47,136 --> 00:45:49,303
(beeping)

691
00:45:52,571 --> 00:45:56,157
- Satellite array set up
and ready to transmit.

692
00:45:56,157 --> 00:45:58,657
- And the microwave TV jammer?

693
00:46:00,429 --> 00:46:01,262
(beeping)

694
00:46:01,262 --> 00:46:02,154
- Also online.

695
00:46:02,154 --> 00:46:05,364
- Where's the communication satellite?

696
00:46:05,364 --> 00:46:08,697
- It should be in place in five minutes.

697
00:46:12,146 --> 00:46:16,364
- Well, Mr. Stefan, are
you ready to write history?

698
00:46:16,364 --> 00:46:18,359
- I don't give a damn about history.

699
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:20,639
I just want the little bastard.

700
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:23,948
- My friend, we've gone to
considerable time and trouble

701
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:26,445
to make this little tea party possible.

702
00:46:26,445 --> 00:46:27,850
I'd hate to see it screwed up

703
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:29,919
because of your lack of self-discipline.

704
00:46:29,919 --> 00:46:31,711
- Don't worry about me, Murdock.

705
00:46:31,711 --> 00:46:33,221
I'm a professional.

706
00:46:33,221 --> 00:46:36,273
- And as a professional, you're
making millions for this.

707
00:46:36,273 --> 00:46:37,901
- I would've done it for free,

708
00:46:37,901 --> 00:46:39,638
just to get my hands on Richter.

709
00:46:39,638 --> 00:46:41,132
- And go find the little shit.

710
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:44,882
He's got great
wrench-in-the-works potential.

711
00:46:51,252 --> 00:46:54,585
A little vanity can make a man go crazy.

712
00:47:03,172 --> 00:47:05,339
- This don't look so good.

713
00:47:18,082 --> 00:47:19,999
- Don't be too anxious.

714
00:47:33,089 --> 00:47:34,717
- All right, look, I want
you to stay out here.

715
00:47:34,717 --> 00:47:37,126
If you see or hear anything, let me know.

716
00:47:37,126 --> 00:47:38,084
- Hey man, I--

717
00:47:38,084 --> 00:47:41,157
- You got a problem with that?

718
00:47:41,157 --> 00:47:42,657
- No I don't, man.

719
00:47:43,889 --> 00:47:47,722
- All right, let's go
take a look at that eye.

720
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:10,089
Here, put this on that eye.

721
00:48:10,089 --> 00:48:10,922
- Thanks.

722
00:48:11,765 --> 00:48:16,553
You know, you're pretty
nice for a, well, you know.

723
00:48:16,553 --> 00:48:18,711
- Not all of us psychotics
foam at the mouth,

724
00:48:18,711 --> 00:48:20,012
just so you know.

725
00:48:20,012 --> 00:48:21,258
- Sorry.

726
00:48:21,258 --> 00:48:22,933
I didn't mean to imply that.

727
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:24,035
- Skip it.

728
00:48:24,035 --> 00:48:25,725
No offense taken.

729
00:48:25,725 --> 00:48:27,467
- I didn't catch your name.

730
00:48:27,467 --> 00:48:29,895
And don't you dare say, "It's
because I didn't throw it."

731
00:48:29,895 --> 00:48:33,478
- (laughing) Mace Richter.

732
00:48:35,301 --> 00:48:38,073
- The cop who shot the prince?

733
00:48:38,073 --> 00:48:40,593
You don't seem like the type.

734
00:48:40,593 --> 00:48:43,926
- Well, that depends on who you believe.

735
00:48:53,313 --> 00:48:54,146
- Hey.

736
00:48:56,729 --> 00:48:58,153
- Hey, hey, you son of a.

737
00:48:58,153 --> 00:48:59,306
Where did you get that?

738
00:48:59,306 --> 00:49:00,742
- Don't worry about it, man.

739
00:49:00,742 --> 00:49:01,849
- [Richter] There's a
lot more to the story

740
00:49:01,849 --> 00:49:03,923
than what you and your buddies reported.

741
00:49:03,923 --> 00:49:05,404
- So, what happened?

742
00:49:05,404 --> 00:49:08,278
- Well, the prince was
in on the hijacking.

743
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,111
- No way!

744
00:49:09,111 --> 00:49:10,288
- Yeah, straight up.

745
00:49:10,288 --> 00:49:13,528
He was trying to extort
money from his own brother.

746
00:49:13,528 --> 00:49:15,490
- Well then, why didn't
one of the hostages

747
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:17,826
come forward at your trial?

748
00:49:17,826 --> 00:49:19,261
- Well, they were questioned,

749
00:49:19,261 --> 00:49:21,553
but none of 'em saw a damn thing.

750
00:49:21,553 --> 00:49:23,391
They all had their heads down.

751
00:49:23,391 --> 00:49:25,888
I took the fall to keep a
couple of Washington fat cats

752
00:49:25,888 --> 00:49:28,431
happy with their buddy, the sultan.

753
00:49:28,431 --> 00:49:29,977
- That's hard to believe.

754
00:49:29,977 --> 00:49:33,335
- (scoffing) Tell me about it.

755
00:49:33,335 --> 00:49:36,323
Better yet, Murdock and Stefan
were on their way to the pen

756
00:49:36,323 --> 00:49:38,251
when their van got ambushed,

757
00:49:38,251 --> 00:49:40,974
probably by the same bunch of
guys he's got with him today.

758
00:49:40,974 --> 00:49:42,522
Now, you talk about irony.

759
00:49:42,522 --> 00:49:44,545
- Do you have any idea
who these assholes are?

760
00:49:44,545 --> 00:49:46,727
- I don't know, but they're
cooking up something nasty

761
00:49:46,727 --> 00:49:48,602
down in the cell block with a machine.

762
00:49:48,602 --> 00:49:49,438
- Come again?

763
00:49:49,438 --> 00:49:52,316
- I think they got a friggin'
bomb down in the cell block.

764
00:49:52,316 --> 00:49:53,497
- Bullshit.

765
00:49:53,497 --> 00:49:55,364
- Look, I may look dumb,
but I know the difference

766
00:49:55,364 --> 00:49:58,781
between bomb and an alarm clock in a box.

767
00:50:00,026 --> 00:50:02,562
- What type of idiot
would blow up a prison?

768
00:50:02,562 --> 00:50:07,227
- I don't know, but we better
think of something fast.

769
00:50:07,227 --> 00:50:09,422
Let's get outta here.

770
00:50:09,422 --> 00:50:11,210
- If I hadn't been so damn ambitious,

771
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:13,910
I'd be at home soaking
in a jacuzzi right now.

772
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,221
- You lost me.

773
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:17,491
- I was supposed to leave
at the end of the tour.

774
00:50:17,491 --> 00:50:19,396
But instead, I had to try and be greedy

775
00:50:19,396 --> 00:50:21,688
and get an interview with you guys.

776
00:50:21,688 --> 00:50:24,460
- And instead, you got
caught in the middle.

777
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,105
- It's just, it's so damn hard

778
00:50:26,105 --> 00:50:28,608
being a woman in the news business.

779
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,482
I'm as good as the rest of them.

780
00:50:30,482 --> 00:50:33,222
But the only reason that they
bothered to keep me around

781
00:50:33,222 --> 00:50:34,639
is for eye candy.

782
00:50:36,734 --> 00:50:38,212
- I'll tell you what.

783
00:50:38,212 --> 00:50:40,169
If we get outta here alive,

784
00:50:40,169 --> 00:50:44,542
I'll let you interview me
'til Hell freezes over.

785
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:47,625
- Well, in that case, I hope we live.

786
00:50:49,241 --> 00:50:50,991
- Okay, let's hit it.

787
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:56,906
Do not adjust your television set.

788
00:50:56,906 --> 00:51:00,158
We control the vertical
and the horizontal.

789
00:51:00,158 --> 00:51:01,518
- Please pardon the interruption

790
00:51:01,518 --> 00:51:05,221
to your Western decadent programming.

791
00:51:05,221 --> 00:51:10,093
Two months ago, several hundred
(inaudible) was liberated

792
00:51:10,093 --> 00:51:12,685
from a Russian armory in Kyrgyzstan.

793
00:51:12,685 --> 00:51:15,186
My brothers in the Holy Black Jihad

794
00:51:15,186 --> 00:51:17,936
have planted in a public building

795
00:51:19,645 --> 00:51:21,562
somewhere in this city.

796
00:51:24,677 --> 00:51:25,989
You Americans are known

797
00:51:25,989 --> 00:51:29,897
for not taking seriously such threats.

798
00:51:29,897 --> 00:51:31,685
- You watching this, Captain?

799
00:51:31,685 --> 00:51:32,518
- Come on.

800
00:51:32,518 --> 00:51:35,228
- Therefore, you may
spend the next two hours

801
00:51:35,228 --> 00:51:37,911
wondering where the bomb is.

802
00:51:37,911 --> 00:51:41,608
When explodes, you will
know we are serious.

803
00:51:41,608 --> 00:51:44,941
Only then, you will receive our demands.

804
00:51:51,136 --> 00:51:55,239
- All right, get SWAT and the
bomb disposal team on standby

805
00:51:55,239 --> 00:51:57,313
and every street cop on tactical alert.

806
00:51:57,313 --> 00:51:58,601
- [Burke] But what if they're bluffing?

807
00:51:58,601 --> 00:52:00,272
- And what if it's parked
right under our asses?

808
00:52:00,272 --> 00:52:02,452
Come on, I got two kids out there.

809
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,558
What if it's under some food
court table in the Galleria?

810
00:52:04,558 --> 00:52:06,808
Just move, will you, Burke?

811
00:52:16,246 --> 00:52:19,495
- If that doesn't work, nothing will.

812
00:52:19,495 --> 00:52:21,297
- [Richter] Were you able
to tell what they're up to?

813
00:52:21,297 --> 00:52:23,410
- [Tracy] They seem to want the prison.

814
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:24,340
- Knowing these bastards,

815
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:27,563
that's just the tip of the iceberg.

816
00:52:27,563 --> 00:52:28,896
Here, take this.

817
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,299
- I don't like knives.

818
00:52:31,299 --> 00:52:32,225
- Me either.

819
00:52:32,225 --> 00:52:36,040
But look, let me show you something.

820
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,290
Forget that Norman Bates stuff, okay?

821
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:39,397
If you hold it like this,

822
00:52:39,397 --> 00:52:42,172
it'll be less easily taken away from you.

823
00:52:42,172 --> 00:52:46,339
Also, it's better to slash than
stab; the wounds are bigger.

824
00:52:49,965 --> 00:52:51,798
- You are so romantic.

825
00:52:53,079 --> 00:52:55,103
- Oh yeah, I've learned a
lot since being in here.

826
00:52:55,103 --> 00:52:58,270
(soft romantic music)

827
00:53:12,511 --> 00:53:13,344
What?

828
00:53:13,344 --> 00:53:14,327
- Over there, over there.

829
00:53:14,327 --> 00:53:15,788
- All right, we'll jump 'em on three.

830
00:53:15,788 --> 00:53:16,621
Let's go.

831
00:53:19,982 --> 00:53:21,189
One.

832
00:53:21,189 --> 00:53:22,324
Two.

833
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:23,157
Three.

834
00:53:23,157 --> 00:53:24,767
(screaming)

835
00:53:24,767 --> 00:53:25,904
- Richter?

836
00:53:25,904 --> 00:53:29,047
- It's good to see you too, Jackson.

837
00:53:29,047 --> 00:53:31,045
Listen, we gotta continue
this party somewhere else

838
00:53:31,045 --> 00:53:32,532
before the host shows up.

839
00:53:32,532 --> 00:53:33,779
We got major problems.

840
00:53:33,779 --> 00:53:34,612
- Damn right.

841
00:53:34,612 --> 00:53:36,480
You won't believe what
I saw, a friggin' bomb.

842
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,175
- Yeah, and that's the
thing, I do believe you.

843
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,008
- [Jackson] No way.

844
00:53:39,008 --> 00:53:39,841
- Yeah.

845
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:41,456
You guys don't know it, but I
know at least two of the guys

846
00:53:41,456 --> 00:53:43,480
responsible for this mess.

847
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,604
- You run in some damn
strange circles, Richter.

848
00:53:45,604 --> 00:53:47,041
- Yeah, you don't know the half of it.

849
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:49,376
When I first met Murdock, the leader,

850
00:53:49,376 --> 00:53:51,803
he was hijacking a 747.

851
00:53:51,803 --> 00:53:53,701
He would've gotten away with it too.

852
00:53:53,701 --> 00:53:55,014
These guys are professionals.

853
00:53:55,014 --> 00:53:56,099
- So, why didn't they?

854
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:57,803
- I was a professional too.

855
00:53:57,803 --> 00:53:58,636
- What the hell?

856
00:53:58,636 --> 00:53:59,810
Why nuke a federal can?

857
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:01,074
- Murdock's a mercenary.

858
00:54:01,074 --> 00:54:02,132
The guy'll work for anybody.

859
00:54:02,132 --> 00:54:03,812
This guy is so far to the right,

860
00:54:03,812 --> 00:54:06,066
he makes Genghis Khan look
like a bleeding heart.

861
00:54:06,066 --> 00:54:06,902
- Oh great.

862
00:54:06,902 --> 00:54:07,735
In other words,

863
00:54:07,735 --> 00:54:10,132
the wrong guy to have
his finger on the button.

864
00:54:10,132 --> 00:54:11,979
- Yeah, good call.

865
00:54:11,979 --> 00:54:13,099
All right, look, if we're gonna mount

866
00:54:13,099 --> 00:54:14,564
any kind of an offensive,

867
00:54:14,564 --> 00:54:17,637
we need a clear idea of
the layout of this place.

868
00:54:17,637 --> 00:54:18,492
- No way, man.

869
00:54:18,492 --> 00:54:19,850
Count me out, I say.

870
00:54:19,850 --> 00:54:22,167
- Yeah, I'm with Gonzales.

871
00:54:22,167 --> 00:54:23,091
- Do you remember what I said

872
00:54:23,091 --> 00:54:26,110
about you being more valuable
to me alive than dead?

873
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:27,723
You're beginning to change my mind.

874
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:29,134
- What's wrong with you?

875
00:54:29,134 --> 00:54:29,967
You need to wake up

876
00:54:29,967 --> 00:54:32,017
and smell the pot you've
been smoking, man.

877
00:54:32,017 --> 00:54:33,850
If we don't come together
and stop these assholes,

878
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:35,074
we're all gonna die.

879
00:54:35,074 --> 00:54:36,404
- [Croaker] Jackson's right.

880
00:54:36,404 --> 00:54:38,545
We got no other choice, the way I see it.

881
00:54:38,545 --> 00:54:40,648
- All right, look, the only one of us

882
00:54:40,648 --> 00:54:44,065
who knows this place inside and out is...

883
00:54:53,113 --> 00:54:55,687
- Katya, my dear, what's
our time situation?

884
00:54:55,687 --> 00:54:59,199
- The integral fuse is linked
with the digital timer.

885
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:01,656
We can begin whenever you want.

886
00:55:01,656 --> 00:55:03,838
- Armageddon, here we come.

887
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:05,142
- We, darling?

888
00:55:05,142 --> 00:55:05,975
- Figure of speech.

889
00:55:05,975 --> 00:55:08,825
I'm not about to go up in a
10-million-degree dutch oven.

890
00:55:08,825 --> 00:55:10,952
- You had me worried for a minute.

891
00:55:10,952 --> 00:55:12,231
- Forget it.

892
00:55:12,231 --> 00:55:16,398
Once Stefan puts Richter's ass
on ice, we're Barbados-bound.

893
00:55:25,549 --> 00:55:27,799
(laughing)

894
00:55:29,776 --> 00:55:32,295
- And that's all I know, I swear.

895
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:35,052
- Okay, you did just fine, kid.

896
00:55:35,052 --> 00:55:38,186
Jackson, blowing stuff up
is what got you in here.

897
00:55:38,186 --> 00:55:40,275
How'd you like to work on
the side of the angels?

898
00:55:40,275 --> 00:55:44,442
- Hey, man, I don't owe
anybody anything. (laughing)

899
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:51,013
(sighing) But for you,
I'll give it my best shot.

900
00:55:51,013 --> 00:55:52,361
- All right, good.

901
00:55:52,361 --> 00:55:54,213
All right, Gonzales, O'Reilly, and Tracy,

902
00:55:54,213 --> 00:55:56,659
the four of us will make our
way to the command center.

903
00:55:56,659 --> 00:55:57,946
Anybody gets in our way--

904
00:55:57,946 --> 00:55:59,599
- We bust a cap on their.

905
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:00,855
- At least one.

906
00:56:00,855 --> 00:56:01,688
All right.

907
00:56:01,688 --> 00:56:04,220
Jackson and Croaker, you
guys get to play recon.

908
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:06,784
Now, I want you to go over to
the bomb as close as you can,

909
00:56:06,784 --> 00:56:10,180
but don't touch anything, just observe.

910
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:12,537
- Sounds like you've
done this before, chief.

911
00:56:12,537 --> 00:56:14,246
- Maybe once or twice.

912
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:15,590
All right, let's fall out.

913
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:18,090
The clock's ticking, let's go.

914
00:56:23,278 --> 00:56:24,419
- One thing.

915
00:56:24,419 --> 00:56:25,325
- What?

916
00:56:25,325 --> 00:56:27,908
- Don't ever call me kid again.

917
00:56:28,894 --> 00:56:30,561
- Oh Jesus, come on.

918
00:56:40,464 --> 00:56:42,714
(groaning)

919
00:57:18,151 --> 00:57:21,901
All right, come out you
guys; it's all clear.

920
00:57:28,309 --> 00:57:30,921
- All right, Jackson, here, take this.

921
00:57:30,921 --> 00:57:31,828
Switch to channel two,

922
00:57:31,828 --> 00:57:34,794
but check for traffic every
few minutes on channel one.

923
00:57:34,794 --> 00:57:36,701
Remember, these guys are dangerous.

924
00:57:36,701 --> 00:57:38,093
- [Jackson] Yeah, right.

925
00:57:38,093 --> 00:57:38,926
(dramatic piano music)

926
00:57:38,926 --> 00:57:40,539
- Richter!

927
00:57:40,539 --> 00:57:43,988
- Whoa, hey, take it easy, Gonzales.

928
00:57:43,988 --> 00:57:45,680
Don't do anything stupid, man.

929
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:46,708
- I ain't your vato.

930
00:57:46,708 --> 00:57:47,585
I'm outta here, man.

931
00:57:47,585 --> 00:57:48,829
I ain't no fuckin' hero!

932
00:57:48,829 --> 00:57:51,012
- You're not going anywhere, Jesus.

933
00:57:51,012 --> 00:57:53,254
If the terrorists don't kill you, I will.

934
00:57:53,254 --> 00:57:54,563
- You just keep flapping, Holmes.

935
00:57:54,563 --> 00:57:56,125
Me and the bitch are history.

936
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:57,028
If you follow us,

937
00:57:57,028 --> 00:58:01,270
I blow her brains all
over the fucking walls!

938
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:04,770
- Gonzales sure has a way with the ladies.

939
00:58:06,085 --> 00:58:07,355
- All right, we don't have time for this.

940
00:58:07,355 --> 00:58:09,696
Jackson, Croaker, you
two get back to the bomb.

941
00:58:09,696 --> 00:58:12,023
O'Reilly, you come with me.

942
00:58:12,023 --> 00:58:15,619
- Oh, I don't think that's a good idea.

943
00:58:15,619 --> 00:58:16,452
- Come on.

944
00:58:27,768 --> 00:58:29,052
No, no, no.

945
00:58:29,052 --> 00:58:29,885
This.

946
00:58:30,789 --> 00:58:32,564
(sighing)

947
00:58:32,564 --> 00:58:33,892
- I never thought that this was gonna be

948
00:58:33,892 --> 00:58:36,067
part of the prison experience, man.

949
00:58:36,067 --> 00:58:38,494
- I never thought I'd ever be in prison.

950
00:58:38,494 --> 00:58:39,743
- Well, you beat a cop to death,

951
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:42,342
they throw you in the hole
and lose the key real quick.

952
00:58:42,342 --> 00:58:44,181
- It was an accident.

953
00:58:44,181 --> 00:58:45,637
- Yeah, well, cry me a river, pal.

954
00:58:45,637 --> 00:58:48,006
I've sung that song myself.

955
00:58:48,006 --> 00:58:50,312
It didn't mean shit then,
doesn't mean shit now.

956
00:58:50,312 --> 00:58:52,574
- It really was an accident.

957
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:55,565
I didn't mean to kill him.

958
00:58:55,565 --> 00:58:59,383
I was in this bar and
this nasty son of a bitch

959
00:58:59,383 --> 00:59:03,048
is throwing a beating to
this tiny little woman!

960
00:59:03,048 --> 00:59:05,817
She was a cute girl, too.

961
00:59:05,817 --> 00:59:08,149
Man, it wasn't right.

962
00:59:08,149 --> 00:59:09,157
So, I punched him.

963
00:59:09,157 --> 00:59:11,539
- (laughing) Broke his
neck, the way I heard it.

964
00:59:11,539 --> 00:59:13,831
- I hit him harder than I meant to.

965
00:59:13,831 --> 00:59:15,087
- That doesn't make any
difference to me, man.

966
00:59:15,087 --> 00:59:16,819
It's one less cop on the
streets to beat the brothers,

967
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:18,715
you know what I'm saying?

968
00:59:18,715 --> 00:59:19,775
Don't get all excited.

969
00:59:19,775 --> 00:59:21,338
I blew up something, remember?

970
00:59:21,338 --> 00:59:22,171
- Huh?

971
00:59:23,931 --> 00:59:26,181
- It was in all the papers.

972
00:59:27,828 --> 00:59:30,078
- I don't know how to read.

973
00:59:32,555 --> 00:59:33,871
- Well, when we get outta this, man,

974
00:59:33,871 --> 00:59:36,704
I'll take care of that real quick.

975
00:59:40,901 --> 00:59:42,317
- Come on baby, let's go.

976
00:59:42,317 --> 00:59:43,791
Come on.

977
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:45,770
- What'd you try and blow up?

978
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:47,353
- The IR-fucking-S.

979
00:59:49,123 --> 00:59:52,055
Yeah, don't get me wrong, man,
I didn't try to kill nobody.

980
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:53,523
I'm not like that Aryan brown shirt

981
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:55,969
that blew up Oklahoma City.

982
00:59:55,969 --> 00:59:57,371
I tried to warn people to get out

983
00:59:57,371 --> 01:00:00,394
so only the building
would blow up, you know?

984
01:00:00,394 --> 01:00:02,061
That was my mistake.

985
01:00:02,936 --> 01:00:05,534
That's what got me nailed.

986
01:00:05,534 --> 01:00:07,849
- Maybe you shouldn't have called.

987
01:00:07,849 --> 01:00:09,873
- Listen, man, I may not
be gentleman of the year,

988
01:00:09,873 --> 01:00:11,329
but I don't kill innocent people,

989
01:00:11,329 --> 01:00:13,829
especially women and children.

990
01:00:14,794 --> 01:00:17,980
I just wanted my message to
be heard, that's all, okay?

991
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:19,889
- Okay, take it easy.

992
01:00:19,889 --> 01:00:22,447
- I am taking it easy, guy.

993
01:00:22,447 --> 01:00:24,360
My old man lost his job, he lost his home

994
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:27,706
because of these tax
collecting cockroaches.

995
01:00:27,706 --> 01:00:30,456
He woulda shot himself otherwise.

996
01:00:31,774 --> 01:00:33,714
- I'm sorry, man.

997
01:00:33,714 --> 01:00:34,964
- Yeah, me too.

998
01:00:37,802 --> 01:00:41,969
(sighing) All right, let's go find a bomb.

999
01:00:46,118 --> 01:00:47,201
- You dumb-ass!

1000
01:00:47,201 --> 01:00:49,276
I told you the way out was back that way!

1001
01:00:49,276 --> 01:00:50,840
- Shut up, bitch, you don't know nothin'.

1002
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:51,673
- I know enough to know

1003
01:00:51,673 --> 01:00:53,909
we've been going in circles, smart ass.

1004
01:00:53,909 --> 01:00:55,532
(groaning)

1005
01:00:55,532 --> 01:00:58,317
- I'm gonna blow your brains
out if you don't shut up, puta!

1006
01:00:58,317 --> 01:00:59,150
- Do it.

1007
01:00:59,150 --> 01:00:59,983
At least I won't have to listen

1008
01:00:59,983 --> 01:01:03,647
to your stupid macho bullshit anymore.

1009
01:01:03,647 --> 01:01:04,980
- Adios, putita.

1010
01:01:05,884 --> 01:01:08,301
(gun firing)

1011
01:01:13,468 --> 01:01:14,301
- Richter?

1012
01:01:16,555 --> 01:01:17,638
- Not hardly.

1013
01:01:22,656 --> 01:01:25,906
This just isn't your day, is it, honey?

1014
01:01:30,555 --> 01:01:32,972
Come on, I'll buy you a soda.

1015
01:01:57,028 --> 01:01:59,406
Look what followed me home.

1016
01:01:59,406 --> 01:02:00,577
Can't I keep her?

1017
01:02:00,577 --> 01:02:02,827
(spitting)

1018
01:02:03,955 --> 01:02:05,999
- With manners like that,

1019
01:02:05,999 --> 01:02:09,020
how is it you were never
hired by a network?

1020
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:11,899
(laughing)

1021
01:02:11,899 --> 01:02:14,066
(beeping)

1022
01:02:18,646 --> 01:02:20,033
- Everything's set.

1023
01:02:20,033 --> 01:02:21,739
The clock is ticking.

1024
01:02:21,739 --> 01:02:23,907
60 minutes and counting.

1025
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:26,406
- Signal the men, we're
extracting in five.

1026
01:02:26,406 --> 01:02:28,496
- I still haven't found
Richter yet, dammit.

1027
01:02:28,496 --> 01:02:29,825
- If you haven't found him by now,

1028
01:02:29,825 --> 01:02:32,782
you're not going to
until he's ready for you.

1029
01:02:32,782 --> 01:02:34,813
- What if he disarms the device?

1030
01:02:34,813 --> 01:02:35,808
- He won't.

1031
01:02:35,808 --> 01:02:38,184
We've incorporated a nasty little surprise

1032
01:02:38,184 --> 01:02:40,560
for anybody who happens along.

1033
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:43,439
- No response from anyone
except Quincy at the front gate.

1034
01:02:43,439 --> 01:02:44,874
- Look around carefully.

1035
01:02:44,874 --> 01:02:46,837
Be back at the truck in five

1036
01:02:46,837 --> 01:02:50,004
or have your sunblock from hell ready.

1037
01:02:54,951 --> 01:02:56,618
You're a pretty one.

1038
01:02:57,563 --> 01:02:58,396
Bruised.

1039
01:03:01,118 --> 01:03:03,098
- I had no idea this was such a big place.

1040
01:03:03,098 --> 01:03:04,530
- Welcome to the club.

1041
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,196
- I wasn't supposed to
be put here, you know.

1042
01:03:06,196 --> 01:03:07,029
- Sure.

1043
01:03:07,029 --> 01:03:08,475
- No, it's true, there was some mistake.

1044
01:03:08,475 --> 01:03:10,557
I was supposed to go to the
minimum security facility

1045
01:03:10,557 --> 01:03:11,649
near Santa Ynez.

1046
01:03:11,649 --> 01:03:12,486
- So?

1047
01:03:12,486 --> 01:03:14,784
- So, my lawyer thinks there
was some kind of mistake.

1048
01:03:14,784 --> 01:03:17,345
The judge wasn't as
impartial as he let on.

1049
01:03:17,345 --> 01:03:18,788
Or maybe he was bought.

1050
01:03:18,788 --> 01:03:19,621
- By who?

1051
01:03:19,621 --> 01:03:21,285
A relative of one of the little old ladies

1052
01:03:21,285 --> 01:03:23,099
you swindled outta their life savings?

1053
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:24,695
- I didn't swindle anybody.

1054
01:03:24,695 --> 01:03:25,933
I was set up.

1055
01:03:25,933 --> 01:03:28,812
- Oh, yeah, likely story.

1056
01:03:28,812 --> 01:03:31,479
But somehow, it sounds familiar.

1057
01:03:38,294 --> 01:03:41,074
(beeping)

1058
01:03:41,074 --> 01:03:41,907
- See?

1059
01:03:56,859 --> 01:03:59,517
- [Jackson] You a praying man, Croaker?

1060
01:03:59,517 --> 01:04:03,135
- [Croaker] I never found
much use for religion.

1061
01:04:03,135 --> 01:04:05,285
- Now's a good time to start.

1062
01:04:05,285 --> 01:04:08,430
- Ooh, what's that?
- Wait a minute!

1063
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:09,812
Don't touch anything.

1064
01:04:09,812 --> 01:04:11,479
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

1065
01:04:17,405 --> 01:04:18,655
- Jesus Christ.

1066
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:22,564
Murdock.

1067
01:04:22,564 --> 01:04:23,397
Murdock!

1068
01:04:23,397 --> 01:04:24,253
- Go on.

1069
01:04:24,253 --> 01:04:25,415
- John's toast.

1070
01:04:25,415 --> 01:04:26,248
- What?

1071
01:04:26,248 --> 01:04:28,163
- [Chapel] His neck's been broken!

1072
01:04:28,163 --> 01:04:29,094
- Don't get cute or clever.

1073
01:04:29,094 --> 01:04:31,796
Just haul ass to the rendezvous point now.

1074
01:04:31,796 --> 01:04:33,085
Don't be late.

1075
01:04:33,085 --> 01:04:34,565
- Over.

1076
01:04:34,565 --> 01:04:38,732
- You son of a bitch, don't
you even say, "I told you so."

1077
01:04:46,609 --> 01:04:48,776
(beeping)

1078
01:05:09,292 --> 01:05:11,886
(panting)

1079
01:05:11,886 --> 01:05:13,684
- Rest time's over, pal.

1080
01:05:13,684 --> 01:05:15,531
- I'm not going another step.

1081
01:05:15,531 --> 01:05:16,917
We could comb this place 10 times

1082
01:05:16,917 --> 01:05:18,980
and never find Gonzales and the girl.

1083
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:21,933
- Yeah, you're damn right we
could, and we will if need be.

1084
01:05:21,933 --> 01:05:23,844
- Well then, you're gonna
do it by yourself, Rambo,

1085
01:05:23,844 --> 01:05:25,140
I'm sitting this one out.

1086
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:27,200
- Have you forgotten about
a little thing called a bomb

1087
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,959
sitting right underneath our asses?

1088
01:05:28,959 --> 01:05:30,580
- I doubt there's any such thing.

1089
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:31,845
Croaker's the only guy that saw it

1090
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:33,439
and he's a functional illiterate.

1091
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,272
- Shh, shh.

1092
01:05:34,272 --> 01:05:35,105
(footsteps approaching)

1093
01:05:35,105 --> 01:05:38,938
Listen.
(dramatic piano music)

1094
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,780
(guns firing)

1095
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:55,957
Come on, O'Reilly, move your!

1096
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:15,193
- Come on, darling, time's a-wasting.

1097
01:06:38,808 --> 01:06:41,058
(groaning)

1098
01:07:00,463 --> 01:07:02,880
(gun firing)

1099
01:07:18,449 --> 01:07:19,665
- I killed him.

1100
01:07:19,665 --> 01:07:21,120
- Yeah.

1101
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,375
I'd say that sums it up pretty good.

1102
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:24,208
Come on.

1103
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:29,168
- Get moving!

1104
01:07:36,983 --> 01:07:39,483
(guns firing)

1105
01:07:42,756 --> 01:07:45,256
(guns firing)

1106
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:51,982
(guns firing)

1107
01:08:06,889 --> 01:08:09,972
(phone keys beeping)

1108
01:08:11,506 --> 01:08:13,412
- I have an urgent message
for Captain Hightower.

1109
01:08:13,412 --> 01:08:14,850
- [Man On Phone] I'm sorry,
the captain's in a meeting.

1110
01:08:14,850 --> 01:08:16,668
Is there someone else?

1111
01:08:16,668 --> 01:08:19,202
- This is Detective Mace
Richter over at Innsmouth.

1112
01:08:19,202 --> 01:08:21,426
There's a bomb here about ready to go off.

1113
01:08:21,426 --> 01:08:24,012
Now, put me through to
Captain Hightower right now.

1114
01:08:24,012 --> 01:08:27,865
- [Man On Phone] Innsmouth, right away.

1115
01:08:27,865 --> 01:08:29,034
(phone ringing)

1116
01:08:29,034 --> 01:08:29,867
- Mace, that you?

1117
01:08:29,867 --> 01:08:30,700
- Yeah, it's me.

1118
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:31,789
Listen, I don't have a lotta time.

1119
01:08:31,789 --> 01:08:33,809
Get the bomb squad over
to Innsmouth right away.

1120
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:34,696
There's a bomb here

1121
01:08:34,696 --> 01:08:36,757
and I have reason to believe
that it's counting down.

1122
01:08:36,757 --> 01:08:38,374
- Oh, Jesus.

1123
01:08:38,374 --> 01:08:40,258
And how many Jihad members they got?

1124
01:08:40,258 --> 01:08:41,098
- Jihad?

1125
01:08:41,098 --> 01:08:43,376
(laughing) No, no,
you've been had, Captain.

1126
01:08:43,376 --> 01:08:45,324
These guys are as white as sliced bread.

1127
01:08:45,324 --> 01:08:47,947
And my old buddy Murdock is at the wheel.

1128
01:08:47,947 --> 01:08:49,078
- Murdock.

1129
01:08:49,078 --> 01:08:50,418
Well, I hope you bagged him.

1130
01:08:50,418 --> 01:08:53,254
Not yet, but it's still early.

1131
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:54,457
- [Hightower] All right,
well you stall him.

1132
01:08:54,457 --> 01:08:56,113
Do anything you have
to until we get there.

1133
01:08:56,113 --> 01:08:57,113
- Bet on it.

1134
01:08:58,684 --> 01:08:59,895
- Burke!

1135
01:08:59,895 --> 01:09:00,895
Get in here.

1136
01:09:05,393 --> 01:09:06,370
- What is it?

1137
01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:07,641
- Get a bomb squad and SWAT

1138
01:09:07,641 --> 01:09:09,371
over to Innsmouth Prison right now.

1139
01:09:09,371 --> 01:09:10,360
- Innsmouth?!

1140
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:11,532
- Yeah.

1141
01:09:11,532 --> 01:09:13,473
The bomb, Burke, it's there.

1142
01:09:13,473 --> 01:09:15,057
- [Burke] How'd you know?

1143
01:09:15,057 --> 01:09:17,348
- My fairy godmother.

1144
01:09:17,348 --> 01:09:19,348
Burke, will you come on?

1145
01:09:27,063 --> 01:09:28,818
(gun firing)

1146
01:09:28,818 --> 01:09:29,651
- Richter!

1147
01:09:35,605 --> 01:09:38,022
(gun firing)

1148
01:10:35,738 --> 01:10:37,988
(groaning)

1149
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:23,227
(beeping)

1150
01:11:24,868 --> 01:11:26,043
- Man, I thought these guys

1151
01:11:26,043 --> 01:11:27,588
were supposed to be professional.

1152
01:11:27,588 --> 01:11:29,152
This is gonna be a piece
of cake. (laughing)

1153
01:11:29,152 --> 01:11:30,235
- Is that so?

1154
01:11:32,975 --> 01:11:34,642
Hands up, jailbirds.

1155
01:11:36,551 --> 01:11:38,884
Get away from the bomb, now.

1156
01:11:42,641 --> 01:11:44,463
Stefan, you there?

1157
01:11:44,463 --> 01:11:45,310
You there, Stefan?

1158
01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:46,452
Respond.

1159
01:11:46,452 --> 01:11:47,991
Stefan, respond.

1160
01:11:47,991 --> 01:11:49,423
- (laughter) Oh yeah,

1161
01:11:49,423 --> 01:11:52,941
Richter probably fucked him up real good.

1162
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:54,858
- Oh, that's hilarious.

1163
01:11:55,894 --> 01:12:00,233
(gun firing)
(groaning)

1164
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:01,316
- Son of a...

1165
01:12:02,391 --> 01:12:05,323
(gun firing)

1166
01:12:05,323 --> 01:12:07,656
(grimacing)

1167
01:12:14,868 --> 01:12:18,368
- I bet that hurts like a
son of a bitch, doesn't it?

1168
01:12:18,368 --> 01:12:22,097
- Somebody must be paying
you real good money

1169
01:12:22,097 --> 01:12:24,166
to be doing this.

1170
01:12:24,166 --> 01:12:26,043
Who is it, the Iraqis?

1171
01:12:26,043 --> 01:12:28,200
Or is it Syrians?

1172
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:31,674
- Love of money's the
root of all evil, friend.

1173
01:12:31,674 --> 01:12:33,471
This one is on the house.

1174
01:12:33,471 --> 01:12:34,751
- [Jackson] I don't get it.

1175
01:12:34,751 --> 01:12:35,751
- Naturally.

1176
01:12:37,945 --> 01:12:39,944
You're part of the problem.

1177
01:12:39,944 --> 01:12:43,641
Right now, those big wigs
are busting their ass,

1178
01:12:43,641 --> 01:12:47,521
trying to accommodate that
towel-headed son of a bitch

1179
01:12:47,521 --> 01:12:50,619
that they think runs this prison.

1180
01:12:50,619 --> 01:12:52,643
Let me tell you something.

1181
01:12:52,643 --> 01:12:54,446
When the blast goes off,

1182
01:12:54,446 --> 01:12:56,834
those Washington wimps are gonna be forced

1183
01:12:56,834 --> 01:12:58,102
to wage a holy war

1184
01:12:58,102 --> 01:13:01,521
against those ever-loving
motherfuckin' Arabs.

1185
01:13:01,521 --> 01:13:03,564
Those camel jockeys are gonna be

1186
01:13:03,564 --> 01:13:05,897
put on the Concorde to hell.

1187
01:13:07,329 --> 01:13:08,990
- Beautiful, great speech!

1188
01:13:08,990 --> 01:13:11,620
When do you pass out the collection plate?

1189
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,453
- Oh, right about now.

1190
01:13:17,287 --> 01:13:19,537
(groaning)

1191
01:14:35,734 --> 01:14:37,464
(straining)

1192
01:14:37,464 --> 01:14:39,714
(laughing)

1193
01:14:41,015 --> 01:14:43,932
(glass shattering)

1194
01:15:25,491 --> 01:15:27,658
(beeping)

1195
01:15:39,029 --> 01:15:39,862
- Richter?

1196
01:15:44,679 --> 01:15:46,025
- Okay, I got you.

1197
01:15:46,025 --> 01:15:46,858
I got you.

1198
01:15:48,413 --> 01:15:51,663
(beeping accelerating)

1199
01:15:53,812 --> 01:15:54,894
- Richter.

1200
01:15:54,894 --> 01:15:55,918
Richter!

1201
01:15:55,918 --> 01:15:57,048
We got a problem.

1202
01:15:57,048 --> 01:15:58,849
- How bad of a problem?

1203
01:15:58,849 --> 01:16:01,384
- On the bad scale,
we're about to be smoked

1204
01:16:01,384 --> 01:16:04,085
like a five-cent cigar, man.

1205
01:16:04,085 --> 01:16:06,360
- [Richter] Christ.

1206
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,479
- Chinese wiring, man.

1207
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:10,263
Only an idiot would use this.

1208
01:16:10,263 --> 01:16:11,763
- Cut the red one.

1209
01:16:12,762 --> 01:16:14,012
Come on, do it!

1210
01:16:14,012 --> 01:16:15,194
Look, 10 seconds, man.

1211
01:16:15,194 --> 01:16:19,111
Whatever you're gonna
do, you better do it now!

1212
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:24,330
(laughing)

1213
01:16:26,674 --> 01:16:29,380
- How did you know it was the red one?

1214
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:30,630
- Oh, I didn't.

1215
01:16:31,593 --> 01:16:35,760
- (laughing) I better change my shorts.

1216
01:16:38,319 --> 01:16:39,152
- Croaker.

1217
01:16:40,105 --> 01:16:42,923
Croaker, hang on man,
the cavalry's on its way.

1218
01:16:42,923 --> 01:16:45,667
- They ain't gonna get here in time.

1219
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:46,500
Hey, pal.

1220
01:16:48,013 --> 01:16:51,596
That reading stuff,
that would've been fun.

1221
01:17:11,659 --> 01:17:12,992
- Hell of a guy.

1222
01:17:14,271 --> 01:17:15,104
- Yeah.

1223
01:17:16,727 --> 01:17:18,722
Look, let's get outta here.

1224
01:17:18,722 --> 01:17:21,972
- No, I'm gonna hang here for a minute.

1225
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:28,023
- Yeah, sure.

1226
01:17:36,901 --> 01:17:37,741
Come on, I got you.

1227
01:17:37,741 --> 01:17:40,058
Come on, let's go.

1228
01:17:40,058 --> 01:17:40,975
You got it?

1229
01:17:41,897 --> 01:17:46,064
(sirens wailing)
(inaudible shouting)

1230
01:17:57,944 --> 01:17:58,777
- Richter!

1231
01:18:00,331 --> 01:18:01,290
Where the hell you get off

1232
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:06,003
throwing this kind of a
picnic and not inviting me?

1233
01:18:06,003 --> 01:18:08,316
Good to have you back, Mace, good work.

1234
01:18:08,316 --> 01:18:10,445
Hi ma'am, Jesse Hightower, LAPD.

1235
01:18:10,445 --> 01:18:11,792
- Tracy Quinn.

1236
01:18:11,792 --> 01:18:13,042
- The reporter?

1237
01:18:13,942 --> 01:18:15,950
Well, keep a close eye on her, huh Mace?

1238
01:18:15,950 --> 01:18:17,873
I think you remember
Patterson here, don't you?

1239
01:18:17,873 --> 01:18:19,290
State Department?

1240
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:24,917
(struggling)

1241
01:18:26,014 --> 01:18:27,540
- Yeah, unfortunately.

1242
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:29,181
- I understand there was
no foreign involvement

1243
01:18:29,181 --> 01:18:30,088
in this matter.

1244
01:18:30,088 --> 01:18:31,732
- Strictly homespun.

1245
01:18:31,732 --> 01:18:33,817
- I want a full immediate debriefing.

1246
01:18:33,817 --> 01:18:36,964
That is, if a governor's
pardon interests you.

1247
01:18:36,964 --> 01:18:37,900
(laughing)

1248
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:39,019
- He's on the level, Mace.

1249
01:18:39,019 --> 01:18:40,047
After this little set-to,

1250
01:18:40,047 --> 01:18:43,781
I guess we figured you
deserved a clean slate.

1251
01:18:43,781 --> 01:18:46,448
- Well, only if he gets one too.

1252
01:18:47,749 --> 01:18:49,470
- [Patterson] I don't know, that's iffy.

1253
01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:51,051
- Come on, Patterson, you tight ass.

1254
01:18:51,051 --> 01:18:52,908
Cut the guy a break, will you?

1255
01:18:52,908 --> 01:18:55,272
- All right, all right, it's done.

1256
01:18:55,272 --> 01:18:56,720
I expect you at the federal building

1257
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:59,887
as soon as the EMTs are done with you.

1258
01:19:01,287 --> 01:19:05,393
- Oh, by the way, I got a job
waiting for you too, you know.

1259
01:19:05,393 --> 01:19:08,716
- I don't think this one's done yet.

1260
01:19:08,716 --> 01:19:11,216
(guns firing)

1261
01:19:12,801 --> 01:19:15,134
(screaming)

1262
01:19:19,753 --> 01:19:21,420
- See you on Monday.

1263
01:19:25,368 --> 01:19:27,269
- What about you?

1264
01:19:27,269 --> 01:19:29,352
You got a job for me too?

1265
01:19:30,919 --> 01:19:32,919
- You bet your ass, 5-0.

1266
01:19:45,885 --> 01:19:49,135
(dramatic piano music)
