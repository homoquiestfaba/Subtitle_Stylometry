1
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,744
There it is.

2
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:02,812
Pretty much how I remember it.

3
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,184
I was younger than you
last time I was here, Simon.

4
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,516
Well, it's big.

5
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,281
Yeah, so I can get bigger pets here,
right, Mom?

6
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:15,657
Sure! Get a cow. Get a whole flock.

7
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:16,854
Herd.

8
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,625
That, too. What do you think, Jared?

9
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,828
Jared?

10
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,837
Okay. Here we go.

11
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,755
It's okay, Mr. Tibbs. It's okay.

12
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,755
It has that old people smell.

13
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,530
It's just an observation, not a judgment.

14
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,519
You're angry about the move. I get that.

15
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:20,156
Just what are you expecting
your silent protest will get you?

16
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,661
At least acknowledge this isn't
the way to deal with your anger

17
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,233
the way you said you were gonna do.

18
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,003
Say yes with your head.

19
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,469
Two blinks.

20
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,135
Nothing.

21
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:43,147
Mal, you and Simon take your stuff.

22
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:46,082
Wait in the foyer while I go look
for the main circuit breaker.

23
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,550
Okay, Mom.

24
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,749
-Get out of the car right now.
-You're not my mother, Mallory.

25
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,793
No, I'm worse,
because Mom doesn't believe in hitting.

26
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:59,024
-Come here, you little...
-And he's out of the car! Thank you!

27
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,896
Stop it! I'm not gonna let you
keep acting like a jerk!

28
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,935
-I'll do whatever I want.
-No, you won't!

29
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,335
Mom needs this to work, so cut it out!

30
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,839
-Simon, get her!
-I'm a pacifist.

31
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:11,804
You're so annoying.
You think you know everything!

32
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,744
-Well, I know stuff you don't.
-Like what?

33
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,043
Nothing.

34
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:22,786
-Thanks for having my back, bro.
-I don't do conflict.

35
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,788
-What are you doing?
-Unpacking.

36
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,864
Why? I told you it was only temporary.

37
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,331
Dad's coming tomorrow,
and he's gonna take us back with him.

38
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:12,029
-I know. But what about Mom?
-She can have Mallory.

39
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,935
Come on, Simon, we can't stay here.

40
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,235
Look at this place.
It's the house that time forgot.

41
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,242
-And it's got that...
-Old people smell, I know.

42
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,073
And what's this?

43
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:28,413
Salt. There's salt on the window.

44
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,045
I know. It's on all the windows.

45
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,817
Yeah, and that's not weird.

46
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,119
I'm guessing she put it there.

47
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,096
-ls that the nut bag and her husband?
-No.

48
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:41,655
That's Arthur Spiderwick,
you know, our great-great-uncle.

49
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:46,831
The little girl's the nut bag.
I mean, Aunt Lucinda, his daughter.

50
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,576
She's the one who lived here
before they took her away to the...

51
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:52,735
To the...

52
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,437
To the nut house.

53
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,413
Right.

54
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,450
And why'd she get taken there?

55
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,086
Because she said
her father was abducted.

56
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,053
Because she said
her father was abducted.

57
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,280
By?

58
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:05,915
By faeries.

59
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,025
Exactly.

60
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:11,893
Our crazy aunt stayed here
her whole life and never left, ever!

61
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,728
That's not gonna happen to me, or you.

62
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:17,196
End of discussion.

63
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,744
Has anybody seen my keys?
I know I left them right here.

64
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:34,945
Nope.

65
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:41,022
I guess Aunt Lucinda
liked honey with her oatmeal, huh?

66
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,754
And tomato sauce.

67
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,567
Wow.

68
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,599
Where is my fencing medal, Jared?

69
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,763
-Hanging on your bed?
-It's not there anymore.

70
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,602
Well, find the bed
and you'll find your medal.

71
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:56,868
I'm not talking about the bed...

72
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,034
You know what?

73
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,409
I'm not acknowledging your existence
until you bring my medal back.

74
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:02,606
Promise?

75
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,115
Well, actually, you'd have to
acknowledge his existence

76
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,776
in order to receive the medal from him.

77
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,854
Thanks, Spock.
You're the pride of the Federation.

78
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,479
Jared, give it back.

79
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,887
I didn't take the stupid medal!

80
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,253
-You're such a liar!
-Conflict.

81
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,383
-Shut up, Simon!
-Shut up, Simon!

82
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,620
Hey!

83
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:20,032
We're not gonna do this.

84
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,699
New town. New house. New job.

85
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,135
This is our new life.

86
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,540
Let's not fall into old ruts, okay?

87
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:34,204
I know this house isn't perfect,
but we can make it work,

88
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,545
if we want to make it work.

89
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,742
-All right?
-All right, Mom.

90
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:43,816
Shut up!

91
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,033
Hi.

92
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:05,740
-Dad.
-Dad.

93
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:08,973
Yeah, we made it.

94
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:10,948
What's that noise in the background?

95
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,416
You know, scratch that.
I don't want to know.

96
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,386
-Just because I don't.
-I'm gonna go look for my medal.

97
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,047
I'll help you.

98
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,217
What?

99
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,290
It's your dad.

100
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,566
-Hi, Dad.
-Hey, buddy.

101
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:34,833
How's the Addams Family mansion?

102
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,738
Oh, the house? Yeah, it's great,

103
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,003
if you like big creepy houses
in the middle of nowhere.

104
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:42,308
-Now, come on.
-Seriously. There's nothing here.

105
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,645
-You'll see.
-Yeah, well, listen...

106
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,743
-You're still coming tomorrow, right?
-Yeah, maybe. I'm gonna try.

107
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,788
-Why maybe?
-Look, don't worry. I'm coming.

108
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,323
There's something
we need to talk about.

109
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,689
But tomorrow might not work out, okay?

110
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,627
-Y eah, I understand.
-Okay, good.

111
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,288
-You'll try though, right?
-Absolutely.

112
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,798
But I'll see you soon, though. Defiinitely.

113
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,027
Okay.

114
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,963
-See you, Son.
-Bye, Dad.

115
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,812
What did you say to him?

116
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:24,611
Can't you at least pretend
you want him to come and see us?

117
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,495
Jared Grace, put that broom down!

118
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,124
-There's something in the wall!
-Now!

119
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,398
You said you were gonna stop
hitting things when you got angry!

120
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:19,774
I know I said I was gonna stop yelling.
Please, please, don't do this.

121
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:26,809
We'll clean it up, Mom.
You go to bed. You need to sleep.

122
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,056
-Nice move, pinhead.
-Shut up.

123
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,719
Something's in there, moving.

124
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:40,128
Probably a red squirrel.
Very common in this region.

125
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,393
Or it could just be a rat.

126
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,701
We don't need any more holes
in the wall!

127
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,849
Great. I'll get blamed for that.

128
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,687
Check it out.

129
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:07,349
This is one of those things
they use to send food upstairs.

130
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,894
-What are they called?
-Dumbwaiter.

131
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,690
Hey, those are Mom's keys.

132
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:19,997
And my medal!

133
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,471
What? You still think I took it.

134
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,871
Yeah, Mal, you busted me.

135
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,910
I took your medal,
hid it here and re-plastered the wall.

136
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,103
I don't know how you did it.

137
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,080
I just know you did it,
because you always do it.

138
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:33,913
-And now you're gonna clean it up.
-You told Mom we were gonna clean it.

139
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,180
We means you.

140
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:42,323
Simon, don't you want to know
where this thing goes?

141
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,827
Not really.

142
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:12,811
Simon!

143
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,878
Simon, wake up!

144
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:21,046
I went up. It's a room,
a secret room, upstairs.

145
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:24,316
There's a desk and a chest,
and I found this book!

146
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,823
-Something was in there!
-A red squirrel?

147
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,020
No, not a squirrel.
Unless squirrels can spell.

148
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:35,223
It wrote in the dust on the desk,
"Jared Grace, leave this place."

149
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,501
Wow.

150
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,367
That's really...impossible.

151
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,837
It's late.

152
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,936
Just go to sleep.

153
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,261
"Do not dare to read this book,

154
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,762
"for if you take one fateful look,

155
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:10,301
"you barter at your life's expense
and face a deadly consequence."

156
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,030
What the...

157
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,145
How did you guys get out?

158
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,113
Dear reader,

159
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,708
what you now hold in your hands
is the culmination ofi a lifie's work.

160
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,685
And you will soon see, as I have,

161
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,622
that there are fiantastical creatures
living among us,

162
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,353
hidden through mimicry and magic.

163
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,264
This book will give you
the tools and techniques

164
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,859
needed to lifit the veil
and see the unseen.

165
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:04,112
The secrets you are about to learn
have been kept hidden fior ages,

166
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:07,674
secrets that many ofi this realm
would prefier to stay hidden.

167
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,880
The creatures you will meet
are truly a sight to behold,

168
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:13,253
and most ofi them do not
like being observed.

169
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:16,885
But, over time,
I have garnered their trust.

170
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:20,863
Some, I am quite happy to report,
I now call firiend.

171
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:26,329
But a rare fiew are, quite firankly,
to be fieared.

172
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:30,238
The darker fiorces ofi this realm
all live in service ofi one creature,

173
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,173
the ogre, Mulgarath.

174
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:36,441
The secrets herein are powerful,
more powerful than even I was aware.

175
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:39,278
Never befiore has knowledge
ofi the fiantastical realm

176
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,045
been assembled in one tome.

177
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:45,283
And so I implore you, dear reader,
to use this infiormation wisely,

178
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,517
fior the ogre, Mulgarath,
seeks this knowledge

179
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,787
with relentless persistence.

180
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:52,864
Ifi he were to obtain the infiormation
in these pages,

181
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,731
I can assure you his intentions
would be ofi the vilest sort.

182
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,598
He assumes many fiorms,

183
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:01,172
and so you must constantly
be on guard.

184
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,673
I deeply fiear that the more I learn,

185
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:07,211
the more I place everyone around me
in grave danger.

186
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:12,016
So, reader, beware.

187
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:14,085
I beseech you, beware.

188
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,682
Mom!

189
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:24,284
-What's going on?
-Mom! Mom, please, help!

190
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:25,761
What happened to you?

191
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:29,493
-Hold still.
-Please, Mom, just cut it! Cut it!

192
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:32,001
-Okay, calm down.
-Mom, please!

193
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,038
Just cut me out! Cut it out!

194
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:35,697
Please, just get a scissors! I don't care!

195
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,799
-What happened?
-He ruined my hair! Get him out!

196
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,072
Jared, you've gone way too far this time.

197
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,240
-Mom, please! Please!
-What? I didn't do this!

198
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,512
I've been sitting in a footlocker
for the last two hours, reading!

199
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,847
Yeah, right!

200
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,353
Ask Simon.

201
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,189
Well, he was in a footlocker.

202
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,521
-Just cut me out!
-Field guide.

203
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,720
Mom, just cut it!

204
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,438
I'm not enjoying this.

205
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,135
I told you, I'll help you catch
a woodchuck or something.

206
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,678
I need the practice. Now, come on.

207
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:16,807
Simon!

208
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,178
That's not fair. He distracted me.

209
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:23,049
-What does "appease" mean?
-"Appease."

210
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:26,886
You know, placate, pacify, assuage.

211
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,085
-ln English.
-To make nice.

212
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:34,263
Is that what you came out here to do?
Well, apology not accepted.

213
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:38,063
I'm not apologizing 'cause I didn't do it!
This did.

214
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,230
A brownie is living in the house
and wants us to leave.

215
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,308
Wow. That's incredible.

216
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,433
You can read!

217
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,603
I'm telling you,
something is in that house with us,

218
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,044
and Arthur Spiderwick knew about it,

219
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,240
and that's why he wrote this guide!

220
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,251
I'm a little lost.
Who needs to be appeased?

221
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,787
-The brownie?
-No, a boggart.

222
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,685
So there's a brownie and a boggart?

223
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,951
A brownie turns into a boggart
when it's angry,

224
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,262
and it got angry
when Mallory destroyed his nest.

225
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:03,751
and it got angry
when Mallory destroyed his nest.

226
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,420
It likes honey.

227
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,829
-That's why all the honey's there.
-Really?

228
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,663
Don't listen to him, Simon.

229
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,634
Come on, let's go eat.

230
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,532
Hello!

231
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,368
Hello?

232
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:30,079
Sorry I wrecked your home,
but I made you a new one.

233
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,610
And I got you some honey.

234
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,585
I read you liked it.

235
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:40,986
Hope you do.

236
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,527
Hope it, you know, appeases you.

237
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,159
I'll be over here.

238
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:52,395
I'm really hoping you actually exist.

239
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:31,935
Hello?

240
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,558
Oh! My, my, my.

241
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:58,830
That is just tasty, tasty, delicious honey.

242
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,830
So good! So yummy, yummy, yummy!

243
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,653
Wait! No! I won't hurt you!

244
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:18,018
Here, here, have some more honey!

245
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:22,287
I shouldn't, I shouldn't, I really shouldn't.
I mean, if you insist.

246
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:26,187
Oh, my, my, my! That is good!

247
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,301
Where are you? Why can't I see you?

248
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:29,357
Where are you? Why can't I see you?

249
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,926
You don't see us, but now you do.
But only if we want you to.

250
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:33,138
We? You mean
all the magical creatures

251
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,333
We? You mean
all the magical creatures

252
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,465
Arthur Spiderwick wrote about.

253
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,168
The book! Oh, my gosh!

254
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:43,543
I'm sorry, master, I've failed!
Failed, failed, failed!

255
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,845
Your instructions were simple,
"Protect the book."

256
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:49,546
And I did it, I hid it,
I bound it and I wound it.

257
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,986
I did my best, locked it in the chest!

258
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,821
But you looked and looked
and found the book!

259
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:59,226
And from the chest,
the thing was stolen!

260
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,231
You foolish boy!

261
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:01,500
Idiot! Are you blind?
I put a note right on the cover!

262
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,095
Idiot! Are you blind?
I put a note right on the cover!

263
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:06,329
Can't you read?

264
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:08,235
Why do I write notes
when no one's gonna read the notes?

265
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,103
I'm sorry. Here! More honey!

266
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,506
No! I'm not falling for that!

267
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:18,040
Oh, that is so good.

268
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,218
And they say I've got anger issues.

269
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,412
"Protect the book. Don't let it get took!"

270
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:27,014
Right, you had to protect the book.
Who told you to protect it?

271
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:33,325
-Wait! What did I say?
-Protect the book, protect the book.

272
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:36,764
It wasn't complicated.
I just had to protect the book. That's all.

273
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,062
Arthur Spiderwick.

274
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:43,072
So he wrote it
and asked you to protect it.

275
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,039
I said, "Master, we must destroy it!"

276
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:47,373
He said, "We must protect the book.

277
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,470
"Keep it in the circle,
safe from the ogre."

278
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:52,379
Ogre? Do you mean Mulgarath?

279
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:56,147
All the years protecting it
now ruined by a little twit!

280
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,950
Circle, circle, little jerkle.
Little jerkle broke the circle!

281
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,116
Whoa! Stop! What circle?

282
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,386
Okay.

283
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:13,497
Look. Here, here.

284
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,903
So it protects the house
to protect the book.

285
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:24,339
-Safe from who?
-Them!

286
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,849
What? Who's them?
I don't see anything.

287
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:29,147
Tibbsy, come here, boy!

288
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,518
Breakfast time! Mr. Tibbs?

289
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,750
All right, what did you do
with Simon's cat?

290
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:37,055
They're not here for the cat.
They want the book!

291
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,263
What is that? What's out there?

292
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,664
It's goblins! Goblins are here.

293
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,169
And all because
you took the book out there

294
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,740
and practically waved it in their faces,
you little twerp!

295
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:51,172
Simon!

296
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,369
Go ahead!
Now look at the mess you made!

297
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:54,279
Simon! They're taking him away.
What's happening?

298
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,678
Simon! They're taking him away.
What's happening?

299
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,272
The Stone! The Stone!
Look through the Stone!

300
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:05,956
What the hell?

301
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:07,456
No! No!

302
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,853
-The book stays or we all die!
-I need it! Let go!

303
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,328
It must stay in the circle! In the circle!

304
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:14,890
Mom!

305
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,391
Mom!

306
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:20,997
-Mom! Where's Mom?
-She went to work, okay? I'm in charge.

307
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,935
Hey, where are you going?

308
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,408
Psycho.

309
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:32,382
Help me!

310
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,009
What are you doing? Help!

311
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,216
Help!

312
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,846
Give me, give me.

313
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:15,624
Give me a leg! Hey, give me!

314
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:16,887
Give me a leg! A leg!

315
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,656
That's not a leg!

316
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,631
This is a leg! Imbeciles.

317
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:25,534
Oh, my God.

318
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:28,068
Simon.

319
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:35,972
Don't move.

320
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:39,244
Slowly lift your foot.

321
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:01,167
Then we must shake on our alliance.

322
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,802
What? It's good.

323
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,776
-Who are you?
-I am Hogsqueal.

324
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:11,713
And I am here on a mission
to destroy the ogre, Mulgarath,

325
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:13,340
who killed my family!

326
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:16,545
Can you help me save my brother?
Please?

327
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:18,315
Yeah! Sure!

328
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,654
I was gonna suggest that
right after you let me out of this cage.

329
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,853
-So, come on! Free me!
-Okay, okay.

330
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:26,192
Get it open. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good.

331
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:28,891
Now get behind me
and keep your mouth shut.

332
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,558
Okay, here's our plan.

333
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:35,332
I will find a safe position over there
and create a distraction with my stick.

334
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,069
Then you leap out with your knife
and finish the beast yourself.

335
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:41,168
I like that plan.
That's a good plan. I'm smart.

336
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,940
What beast?

337
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:45,413
The ogre, of course! Mulgarath!

338
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:48,077
-I just want to save my brother.
-Again with the brother?

339
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:51,952
Okay, fine. If we kill them,
saving him will be much easier.

340
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:53,751
Trust me. Now drop that stone.

341
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,587
You'll need both hands
to choke a goblin.

342
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:57,786
But how do I see without...

343
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:00,262
Nailed him!

344
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:06,659
I have given you the Sight,
a gift only a hobgoblin can bestow.

345
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:07,965
Oh, gross!

346
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:10,267
You're welcome. Now, let's go.

347
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:22,009
-Simon!
-Jared.

348
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,054
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

349
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:27,687
Jared, what's happening?
Get me out of here.

350
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:29,225
Just hang on.

351
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,054
I'm gonna cut you out.

352
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,790
-Jared!
-Get back.

353
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:35,422
Hide.

354
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:36,659
Jared!

355
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,761
Mulgarath!

356
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:42,066
Mulgarath!

357
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,198
Mulgarath!

358
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,174
Mulgarath!

359
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:47,710
Mulgarath!

360
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:50,838
-What are they doing?
-Summoning Mulgarath. Get ready.

361
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:55,511
Mulgarath! Mulgarath! Mulgarath!

362
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,811
That's Mulgarath?

363
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,609
That's the ogre
you're all freaked out about?

364
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,744
That old man?

365
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:32,482
Don't be fooled
by what you think you see.

366
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,581
That's just what he wants.

367
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,589
I beg your forgiveness.

368
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:46,159
I asked my friends here
to invite you to a nice little meeting.

369
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,997
Then they got a bit overzealous.

370
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,101
That's a goblin for you.

371
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,007
My apologies.

372
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,040
What do you want with me?

373
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:02,244
It's not what I want with you.

374
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:04,651
It's what I want from you.

375
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,384
Arthur Spiderwick's field guide.

376
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,289
I know you found it.

377
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:14,257
That's right, you can simply
walk back the way you came.

378
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,628
Just give me the book.

379
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:19,293
I don't have it.

380
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,135
I don't. Look.

381
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:24,172
Search him!

382
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,208
What? If Mulgarath learns the secrets
in that book,

383
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:30,615
he could kill us all!

384
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,309
he could kill us all!

385
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,816
He's weak in his human form.
It's now or never.

386
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:36,045
Come! Death to the ogre!

387
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:37,246
Bird!

388
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:39,448
Delicious! Come back here!

389
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,960
I'll be back! Kill him if you get a chance!
Remember the plan!

390
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,120
I'll be back! Kill him if you get a chance!
Remember the plan!

391
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:44,421
Move!

392
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,226
Pockets. Search the pockets.

393
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:50,495
The pockets! No, these!

394
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:53,297
These are pockets, idiot!

395
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:55,668
Master, this is all we found.

396
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,780
Do they have the book?

397
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,645
No.

398
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:13,850
But I know where it is.
I'll go get it and give it to you. I swear.

399
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,022
I'm placing my trust in you.

400
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,698
If you give me the book,

401
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:23,961
your life will go on
as if nothing ever happened.

402
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:26,933
However, if you fail,

403
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:32,943
I'm afraid I'll have to find somebody else
to get my book for me.

404
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,745
Go. Go on.

405
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,340
Run along.

406
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:41,475
Go.

407
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:50,424
Mulgarath! Mulgarath! Mulgarath!

408
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:00,597
You failed me, Redcap!

409
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,469
There are two human boys
with the same faces.

410
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:07,340
The Jared and the not Jared.
We took the wrong one.

411
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:11,381
Then find the Jared,
get the book and kill them!

412
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:13,211
Kill them all!

413
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:14,614
Move out!

414
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,995
Stupid!

415
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,466
Stupid!

416
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,663
Those things were gonna kill me
over your stupid, stupid book!

417
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:36,637
-They're right over there.
-I can't take this.

418
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,538
Let's just get to the house
and give it to them.

419
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:41,373
Hey, it's not at the house.
It's right here in my backpack.

420
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:44,846
-What? Then let's just give it to them.
-No, they'll just kill us anyway!

421
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,883
Well, let's just...

422
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:48,679
-Give it!
-Stop!

423
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:49,980
Give it!

424
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:55,419
Book!

425
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:58,893
-Get them! Go! Go! Go!
-Come on!

426
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,028
After them!

427
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,434
Get them! Get them! Rip them apart!

428
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:13,169
But not the book! Don't hurt the book!

429
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:23,381
Jared! Jared! Over here!
Help me! Help me!

430
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,580
Come on!

431
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:28,326
-Calm down!
-Keep them away! Keep them away!

432
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:28,348
-Calm down!
-Keep them away! Keep them away!

433
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,689
It's okay. There's a protective circle
around the house.

434
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,093
-We're safe inside it.
-There you are.

435
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:35,392
You know, Mom left me in charge,

436
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,865
so you can't just run off
without telling me.

437
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,902
-Get her.
-Mallory, this way, now!

438
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:41,062
Now! Now!

439
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:42,764
-What? Don't yell at me.
-Mal, come on! Come on!

440
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,307
Run to the front door, fast!

441
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:46,774
I'm not running anywhere,
and stop throwing rocks at me!

442
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:49,210
Listen to him!
You're surrounded by goblins!

443
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,008
Get inside the protective circle!

444
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:53,709
Oh, God, Simon,
he's got you in on this now?

445
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:57,219
For the last time,
there's no such thing as...

446
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:00,056
What's happening?

447
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:03,719
No, Mallory, they're short.
Aim below your knees. 10 o'clock.

448
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,489
10 o'clock!

449
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,892
Mallory! Mallory! 12 o'clock!

450
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,592
Behind you! Behind you! 6 o'clock!

451
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:11,998
3 o'clock! 3 o'clock!

452
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,751
Come back! You're safe. You're safe.

453
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,224
You're safe.

454
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,968
Now do you believe me?

455
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:49,466
Mom!

456
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,372
It's gonna be bad! It's bad!

457
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,412
-Oh, God.
-No, that's bad.

458
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,210
-Mom!
-Jared!

459
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:01,808
-What were those things?
-I told you, goblins.

460
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:04,410
It's okay, Simon. It's okay.

461
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,387
No, it's not okay! It's not! It's not!

462
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,651
He's right. What am I saying?
Of course it isn't!

463
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,283
How many of those things
are out there?

464
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,158
I don't know! I don't know! Okay?
Sit tight! I'll be right back!

465
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:16,825
Jared! God, he's gonna get us all killed!

466
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:19,698
I'll be right back. Keep pressure on that.

467
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,669
Pressure? What?

468
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:22,761
Jared?

469
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:25,865
Why are they doing this?
What do they want from us?

470
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:27,274
The book.

471
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,814
Oh, God!
They're coming from everywhere!

472
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,581
I know, I can see.

473
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:41,517
This can't be happening.
This can't be happening.

474
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,893
Where did you get that book?

475
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:47,254
So, the book was in here
with a big warning that said,

476
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,299
"Do not read," and you read it?

477
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,063
It's a book. I didn't think reading it
would unleash goblin fury, okay?

478
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,400
But that's the thing,
you never think of anything!

479
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:57,201
-You're always doing this!
-Yeah, right.

480
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:58,900
You don't think, you just do!

481
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,739
Maybe I could think if you'd stop talking.

482
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:02,437
You do stuff and we pay for it.

483
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:05,242
Hey, if you're so smart,
what do you think we should do with it?

484
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:07,249
If freaky goblins want this book,
I say we give it to them!

485
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:08,511
No!

486
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,052
Back off! The book stays here!

487
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:18,559
-Right here! Here, here, here!
-No! Mallory, no! No!

488
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:19,857
What is that hideous thing?

489
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,158
Haven't I made myself that clear?
Touch it and you'll pay!

490
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:23,290
-Stop it! Chill! Chill!
-Touch it and I'll bite your fingers off!

491
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,425
Get me some honey from the kitchen.

492
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:25,593
-What?
-Just do it!

493
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:28,297
Come on, try it! Try it!
I invite you to try it!

494
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:29,896
-Go!
-You'll be fingerless, you...

495
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:31,235
You, get away!

496
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:32,900
-You ruined everything!
-Okay, protect the book.

497
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:33,999
Okay, I promise.

498
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:35,703
-Mallory!
-I'm coming!

499
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,474
-Okay, honey's coming, honey's coming.
-ldiots!

500
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:41,108
-I don't need your stinking honey!
-Here, drink, drink.

501
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,814
-It's okay. It's okay.
-It's okay?

502
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:47,584
There is so much about this
that's not okay.

503
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:50,217
I don't even know where to start.

504
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,387
Why can I see him
without that stone thing?

505
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,986
Because he's letting you see.

506
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:57,534
Thimbletack, what happens
if goblins get the book?

507
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:01,696
You die, I die, we all die. Bye-bye.

508
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:05,333
-What does he mean, we all die?
-I think he means we all die.

509
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:09,140
He can't know the secrets. He can't!
The ogre is not to be trusted.

510
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:11,441
He's right. We can't give it to Mulgarath.

511
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:14,313
He'll just kill us anyway.
I heard him say so.

512
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:16,613
Then let's just burn it.

513
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:19,923
No!

514
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:20,991
No!

515
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:29,623
Give it! Give the book!

516
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:30,928
Give it!

517
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,668
Sorry, master! Forgive us!

518
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,138
Give the book!

519
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:46,616
Okay, okay, okay, wait!

520
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,550
You win. You are strong,
smart human boy.

521
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:53,612
So don't be foolish. Give us the book.
We'll leave you alone.

522
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,055
I don't believe you!

523
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,649
No!

524
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:59,389
Now you've done it! Now you will pay!

525
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,962
Book!

526
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,472
Book, book, book.

527
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:15,944
Book, book, book, book, book.

528
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:20,608
-It's cold.
-You can't stay in the circle forever.

529
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:23,585
And when you leave, here we will be.

530
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,766
Let me guess,
the book's got a charm on it.

531
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:44,738
Lest there fall any more harm on it.

532
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,002
Great.

533
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:49,239
-They're not leaving.
-I know.

534
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:52,372
-They're never leaving!
-I heard you.

535
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:54,747
-Why does he want that book so bad?
-I don't know.

536
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,342
Well, figure it out!

537
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:59,287
All I know is Mulgarath
can't break the circle without this book,

538
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,324
so we're safe as long as
we stay in the house.

539
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:02,892
Until when?

540
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:06,451
We stay here long enough,
we're gonna end up like her!

541
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:08,956
Wait a minute.

542
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,431
-She can help us.
-Aunt Lucinda? Are you kidding?

543
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:15,505
We don't even know her
or where she is!

544
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:16,935
I think I do.

545
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,565
She's at the Woodhaven Sanatorium.

546
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:20,837
But how do you get to her?

547
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:38,789
-There, all safe.
-Good. Now go. Make haste.

548
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:41,364
Okay, I think I have this figured out.

549
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:44,628
Some sort of secret tunnel system,
goes all the way to town.

550
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:46,703
About a mile, that way.

551
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:50,262
The first ladder you find, go up,
and the sanatorium's here.

552
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:51,568
Thanks.

553
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:54,274
You ready?

554
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:56,770
Oh, yeah. Now I'm ready.

555
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:59,714
-All right. Let's go.
-Mallory?

556
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:03,218
I already told you, Simon, you can't go.
Not with that leg, you'll slow us down.

557
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,912
I know, but I found this.
It'll make it easier for you to see.

558
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,634
Okay, Simon?

559
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,038
Go!

560
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:21,697
Go!

561
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:33,311
-Hey, are you there?
-Show yourselves!

562
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,555
Yeah, right here, on the porch!
Come to me on the porch!

563
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:41,750
Yeah, yeah, good.
Right here, over here.

564
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,486
Yeah, are you hungry?

565
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:46,427
-Right here on the porch.
-Come on. Hurry up. Get in.

566
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:50,296
Go! Go! Go!
They're coming! Open the door!

567
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,732
Jared, hurry!

568
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:53,928
-Come on!
-Get in, get in!

569
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:59,573
Let's go! Go, go, go!

570
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,284
Wait, wait, wait.

571
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,651
This way, this way, this way.

572
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,562
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

573
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,461
Dig! Dig!

574
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:29,640
Go!

575
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,334
Go!

576
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:33,501
"Goblin defenses.

577
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,136
"Tomato sauce burns the skin like acid.

578
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:38,305
"Vinegar fumes asphyxiates.

579
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:40,349
"Salt, blinding effect."

580
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:43,281
Are there more?
What does the book say?

581
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:46,686
-Step away from the book!
-Okay, okay, you open it.

582
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,925
Where is it?
Where did he put it? Where?

583
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,361
Oh, there.

584
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:57,230
Oh, no. Jared.

585
00:43:57,334 --> 00:44:00,303
-What did you do with it? Liars! Liars!
-No, it wasn't me.

586
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:03,532
All of you, liars! Where's the book?

587
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:09,511
-You brought the book?
-We need to show it to Lucinda.

588
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:13,576
-Which way goes into town?
-Right.

589
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:23,551
Get the troll.

590
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:28,297
Now left. Go left!

591
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:43,172
-It's a mole troll.
-What?

592
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,406
Run!

593
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:03,931
This way!

594
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,698
Go, go, go!

595
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:12,869
Jared!

596
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:16,473
Jared!

597
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,014
Jared, come on!

598
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:51,838
Are you okay?
Oh, man, did I hit somebody?

599
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:53,541
Yes. Thank you!

600
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,781
Then you hit F1, tab, tab.

601
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:02,415
Then shift-return to get the total.

602
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:14,599
I know, it's a lot to remember,
but let's just go through it again.

603
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,441
Here you go.

604
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:32,283
So tomato sauce really kills goblins?

605
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,094
Jared, come on.

606
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:53,808
-You're really in a hurry.
-We're just really excited to see her.

607
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:57,847
-Those are nice flowers and sword.
-I take fencing.

608
00:46:57,948 --> 00:47:00,075
Lucinda? You have visitors.

609
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,285
More salt.

610
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:15,863
There, there, there, now.
It's okay. It's okay.

611
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:17,490
Aunt Lucinda?

612
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:23,966
I'm Mallory Grace,
and this is my brother, Jared.

613
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:25,735
Our mom's Helen.

614
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,076
We have some questions.

615
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:33,741
-See, we moved into your house.
-What?

616
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,820
Oh, no, no, no.

617
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,979
No, it isn't safe.

618
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:40,818
Why have you done this?

619
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:43,757
Mom said you gave it to her
since she's the only living heir.

620
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,352
-No, you have to get out of there.
-We can't.

621
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:48,590
We don't have anywhere else to go.

622
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:52,100
-lt isn't safe. You don't understand.
-Yes, we do.

623
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:55,268
We know everything. We've seen.

624
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,940
It's okay. They've seen.

625
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:16,783
Mallory, look.

626
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:36,574
No, no, not for you.

627
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,806
She's right.

628
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,281
Eat that and you'll never crave
human food again.

629
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:42,944
-How do you know that?
-I found this.

630
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:45,846
Your father's field guide.

631
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:50,961
Inside, quickly, quickly!

632
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:51,256
Inside, quickly, quickly!

633
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:52,555
Quickly!

634
00:48:57,467 --> 00:49:01,528
Do you know what you've done
by bringing it outside the circle?

635
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:05,800
Don't you know what could happen
if it falls into the wrong hands?

636
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:08,469
No, we don't.
That's why I brought it to you.

637
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:10,546
Then you haven't read it.

638
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:12,609
He did.

639
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:17,347
Then you know more than you should.

640
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,422
And your lives are in danger.

641
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:21,787
Didn't you read the note?

642
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:25,123
Please. We don't know what to do.

643
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:28,129
Can't you tell us something
that'll help us?

644
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:38,463
This book has brought nothing
but heartache and misery to my family.

645
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:44,607
I would say it was his life's work,
but, in truth, it was his life.

646
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:50,310
The last day I saw him
he was so agitated,

647
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,081
almost delirious.

648
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:55,350
I remember him
running through the house,

649
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:57,450
a crazed look in his eyes.

650
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:00,424
That was the day he created the circle.

651
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:11,840
A book Mulgarath would use
to destroy all the other fiaeries.

652
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:14,934
And then nothing could stop him,
even humans,

653
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:18,708
from becoming the most powerful
creature the world had ever known.

654
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:23,252
My fiather immediately did everything
he could to protect us.

655
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,877
Everything except...

656
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:26,580
Master must destroy the book!

657
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,954
No! We need to protect it!

658
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:32,654
Keep it inside the circle,
safe from the ogre!

659
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:35,960
I just need more time, Thimbletack.
I need more time.

660
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:39,126
But I didn't know
about the circle, you see.

661
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:42,603
London Bridge is fialling down

662
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:43,900
Falling down

663
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:45,235
Oh, no!

664
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:46,934
Falling down

665
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:50,502
London Bridge is fialling down

666
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:52,138
Lucy!

667
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:54,580
Come away from the toadstools!

668
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:57,118
-What?
-Stay inside the circle!

669
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,415
-I can't hear you!
-Lucy! No!

670
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:03,084
London Bridge is fialling down

671
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:09,829
Daddy! Please, help me!
Somebody's dragging me, Daddy!

672
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:11,867
-Leave her alone!
-Daddy!

673
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:17,432
Lucy, come! Come! Stay there!

674
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:20,374
-Stay inside the circle!
-Daddy! Daddy, what's going on?

675
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:24,106
-What's happening?
-Don't go over the mushrooms! No!

676
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:28,215
What are those?
Daddy, what are those things?

677
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:29,615
Tell me!

678
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,549
Daddy! Daddy?

679
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,349
Daddy?

680
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:38,792
The sylph protect
the entire fiaerie realm,

681
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:42,991
and the secrets my fiather discovered
put them in danger.

682
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,194
So they rescued him firom the goblins,

683
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,271
but took him away firom me.

684
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:52,000
-Daddy!
-Lucy! I'll be back!

685
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:54,036
Each day,

686
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:57,273
I would stare down that drive,

687
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:01,845
and dream of him
walking up those steps

688
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,715
and holding me in his arms once again.

689
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:10,120
But he never did.

690
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:16,028
One night, I dreamt that I saw him
in the woods.

691
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,533
So I went out to look for him,

692
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:23,169
but something wouldn't let me.

693
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:29,776
When they say suicide
and you say goblins,

694
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,706
here is where they put you.

695
00:52:34,951 --> 00:52:37,579
They thought I'd read the book, you see.

696
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:41,918
Mulgarath will stop at nothing
to get these secrets,

697
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:46,853
which is why you and your family
are in grave danger.

698
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:50,330
And there is only one person
who can help you.

699
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:52,594
-Who?
-My father.

700
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:57,270
Your father? But your father's dead.

701
00:52:57,374 --> 00:52:59,808
No! No, no, he's not dead.

702
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,401
The sprites have told me he's alive,

703
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:06,175
held captive by the sylph
for all that he knows.

704
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:08,751
You must find him,

705
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:12,686
bring him his book
and have him destroy it.

706
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:15,223
It is your only hope.

707
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:18,824
-No!
-Give me that!

708
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:20,760
Where did he come from?

709
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:27,503
-No!
-Horrible, horrible!

710
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:33,501
Mom?

711
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:37,510
Useless!

712
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:40,942
-Worthless! No.
-Wait. Wait.

713
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:44,248
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What's this? What's this? No?

714
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:46,447
You had the book in your possession,

715
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:51,323
and all you bring me is pages
of nixies and phooka habitats!

716
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:52,827
Don't hurt me.

717
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:55,363
It hurts!

718
00:53:57,534 --> 00:54:00,332
"Charm for protective circle."

719
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,167
Forgive me, master.

720
00:54:05,508 --> 00:54:09,171
When the moon rises,
the book will be mine.

721
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:12,611
Redcap, we have a potion to make.

722
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:14,809
Oh, no. This is not good.

723
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,751
Must find human boy. Must warn him.

724
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:19,754
Or maybe I'll just hide. I like that plan.

725
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:23,516
So, you say you found this book,

726
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:28,394
and it tells you how to see faeries
and goblins and magic sprites,

727
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:31,592
and that's what this is all about.

728
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:34,192
I told you you wouldn't believe me.

729
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:37,273
-What do you think about all this, Mal?
-It's true, Mom.

730
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:39,001
No, it's not!

731
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:45,048
Do you really think I am so stupid
that I don't see what this is about?

732
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:46,445
You hate the house

733
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:49,746
and you want to go back to New York
and to our old life!

734
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:53,380
Well, let me just be really clear
when I say

735
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:56,925
that isn't gonna happen.

736
00:54:57,761 --> 00:55:00,855
Because we can't afford New York,
because...

737
00:55:05,268 --> 00:55:07,532
This is why Dad left, you know.

738
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:09,362
Excuse me?

739
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,599
When someone's trying to tell you
something you don't wanna hear,

740
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:12,800
this is what you do.

741
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:15,070
You just stop listening and start yelling.

742
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:16,611
You did it to Dad all the time.

743
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:18,044
-Stop it.
-I saw you.

744
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,775
Yeah, you saw what you wanted to see.

745
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:22,875
You wouldn't listen,
and that's why he left!

746
00:55:25,709 --> 00:55:26,767
Get out.

747
00:55:26,877 --> 00:55:28,845
-What?
-I said get out.

748
00:55:29,446 --> 00:55:30,640
Gladly.

749
00:55:34,484 --> 00:55:37,476
I hate you,
and I don't want to live with you!

750
00:55:47,798 --> 00:55:50,858
Don't you think you should just tell him?

751
00:55:54,538 --> 00:55:57,939
Go inside, Mal.
We'll deal with this when I get home.

752
00:56:17,327 --> 00:56:20,160
Oh, my! We're so organized.
Organized, organized, organized.

753
00:56:20,263 --> 00:56:22,925
Look at that. That's very good.
More bombs for you.

754
00:56:23,033 --> 00:56:25,729
The book! What happened to the book?
What did you do to the book?

755
00:56:25,836 --> 00:56:28,896
-It's okay, it's okay. I'll talk to him.
-Stained!

756
00:56:29,005 --> 00:56:30,870
You said you wouldn't take the book,
and you lied!

757
00:56:30,974 --> 00:56:33,135
-You tricked him!
-I know. I'm sorry.

758
00:56:33,243 --> 00:56:35,939
Jared, I think you should come
and see this.

759
00:56:46,289 --> 00:56:48,280
See? No goblins.

760
00:56:48,391 --> 00:56:50,154
-Do you think they've given up?
-Wrong!

761
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,095
Goblins don't give up.
They're too stupid to know how.

762
00:56:59,202 --> 00:57:00,328
They're relentless,
and they're out there right now, plotting,

763
00:57:00,437 --> 00:57:01,734
which is why I came back for you.

764
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:03,897
Now is the perfect time to...

765
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:06,669
Bird! Bird!

766
00:57:06,777 --> 00:57:10,406
Come here, come here, come here.
Don't go up there! No, come here!

767
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:12,744
-What is that?
-It's Hogsqueal.

768
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:14,917
Wait a minute.

769
00:57:15,018 --> 00:57:17,816
-Do birds live in these little houses?
-Yeah.

770
00:57:17,921 --> 00:57:19,616
Oh, my gosh. That's genius.
Who thought of that?

771
00:57:19,723 --> 00:57:20,883
You can stick your tongue right in.

772
00:57:20,991 --> 00:57:23,789
Hogsqueal! Hogsqueal!

773
00:57:23,894 --> 00:57:25,794
You said the goblins are plotting.
To do what?

774
00:57:25,896 --> 00:57:30,230
They have pages of the book.
That stupid book!

775
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:32,631
You don't understand.
I talked to Spiderwick.

776
00:57:32,736 --> 00:57:34,966
I shared hobgoblin secrets.

777
00:57:35,071 --> 00:57:39,940
But Mulgarath stole just that one page,
then used it to kill my entire family!

778
00:57:40,043 --> 00:57:42,102
If he gets ahold of the whole book,

779
00:57:42,212 --> 00:57:45,579
he will do the same to everyone,
including you!

780
00:57:45,682 --> 00:57:48,674
And now he's coming.
"When the moon rises," he said.

781
00:57:48,785 --> 00:57:51,720
But we'll be waiting. We'll set a trap.

782
00:57:51,822 --> 00:57:56,816
You with your knife and me hiding safely
near these bird homes.

783
00:57:56,927 --> 00:58:00,260
-Who is that? Who's up there?
-More humungous humans!

784
00:58:00,363 --> 00:58:02,422
Recruits for the alliance!

785
00:58:06,036 --> 00:58:09,494
Huh? Huh? Join us on our quest!

786
00:58:09,606 --> 00:58:12,575
Vengeance or death!

787
00:58:12,676 --> 00:58:14,143
Hopefully vengeance.

788
00:58:14,244 --> 00:58:16,337
Okay, here's the plan.

789
00:58:16,446 --> 00:58:20,906
No, no. Wait, wait, wait!
We must unite! We must stay focused!

790
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:27,214
Dad, I've left like four messages.

791
00:58:27,324 --> 00:58:29,189
Why haven't you called back?

792
00:58:29,292 --> 00:58:30,816
Where are you?

793
00:58:31,728 --> 00:58:35,494
You've got to come here right now.
There's all this crazy...

794
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:38,067
All this weird stuff's been happening.

795
00:58:38,168 --> 00:58:39,863
Bad stuff, real bad.

796
00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:42,165
And you, you said
you were gonna come get me.

797
00:58:42,272 --> 00:58:43,864
So where are you?

798
00:58:52,315 --> 00:58:54,180
He's not coming, is he?

799
00:58:58,722 --> 00:59:00,587
He's with someone else.

800
00:59:01,925 --> 00:59:03,790
He's moved in with her.

801
00:59:04,995 --> 00:59:07,259
He's not getting back with Mom.

802
00:59:08,832 --> 00:59:10,060
He's not.

803
00:59:14,671 --> 00:59:17,162
Mom wanted him to tell you himself.

804
00:59:18,108 --> 00:59:20,702
She's been waiting for him to do that.

805
00:59:33,957 --> 00:59:36,118
It's okay, Tibbsy. It's okay.

806
00:59:37,894 --> 00:59:39,828
Oh, God, they're coming.

807
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:41,898
Jared, what do we do now?

808
00:59:48,071 --> 00:59:49,436
Lucinda said our only chance

809
00:59:49,539 --> 00:59:52,337
is to take the book to Arthur Spiderwick
and have him destroy it.

810
00:59:52,442 --> 00:59:53,534
What?

811
00:59:53,643 --> 00:59:57,340
We don't even know if he's alive,
let alone how to find him.

812
01:00:04,988 --> 01:00:07,422
-What? What are you looking for?
-He had a pet.

813
01:00:07,524 --> 01:00:10,925
A pet?
And Fluffy the dog is gonna save us?

814
01:00:11,027 --> 01:00:13,894
It wasn't a dog. It was this, a griffin.

815
01:00:14,731 --> 01:00:17,598
"When I call upon him
in the native tongue of the tree elf

816
01:00:17,701 --> 01:00:21,159
"with whom he dwells,
he comes to my assistance."

817
01:00:21,271 --> 01:00:23,296
See? His pet can find him.

818
01:00:23,974 --> 01:00:28,104
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Summon a griffin in native tree elf

819
01:00:28,211 --> 01:00:31,647
to find a 1 25-year-old man
who may or may not be alive?

820
01:00:31,748 --> 01:00:33,340
That's our plan?

821
01:00:35,151 --> 01:00:38,643
And you know how to summon
a griffin in native tree elf?

822
01:00:42,993 --> 01:00:44,290
Of course.

823
01:00:58,742 --> 01:01:00,107
Is that it?

824
01:01:01,177 --> 01:01:02,644
Did it work?

825
01:01:05,315 --> 01:01:06,680
I guess not.

826
01:01:11,254 --> 01:01:13,848
Whoa! That sounds like a big one.

827
01:01:21,498 --> 01:01:23,329
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

828
01:01:34,544 --> 01:01:37,342
-Jared! Jared!
-Simon, be careful!

829
01:01:37,447 --> 01:01:40,883
Yes, yes, yes! Find Arthur Spiderwick.
Bring him the book.

830
01:01:40,984 --> 01:01:43,384
There's your ride. Off you go.
Go, go, go!

831
01:01:43,486 --> 01:01:45,420
What? You want us to ride that beast?

832
01:01:45,522 --> 01:01:49,014
He's not a beast. He's a bird.

833
01:01:49,125 --> 01:01:50,717
He's a big-boned bird!

834
01:01:50,827 --> 01:01:53,387
There's no way we can possibly...

835
01:01:53,496 --> 01:01:55,794
It's okay. Calm down. It's okay.

836
01:01:56,933 --> 01:01:58,264
Cool pet.

837
01:02:01,204 --> 01:02:03,434
Hurry up! What are you waiting for?
Get on him!

838
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:52,514
My God, it's him.

839
01:03:53,516 --> 01:03:55,177
Arthur Spiderwick.

840
01:03:56,386 --> 01:03:57,876
He's alive.

841
01:03:57,987 --> 01:03:59,181
Whoa.

842
01:04:12,202 --> 01:04:15,228
-How are we gonna get home?
-Arthur Spiderwick?

843
01:04:18,041 --> 01:04:19,599
Thank God we found you.

844
01:04:19,709 --> 01:04:22,303
You don't even know
what we've been through.

845
01:04:22,412 --> 01:04:25,939
-I'm sorry. Do I know you?
-Not really.

846
01:04:26,049 --> 01:04:29,416
Lucinda, your daughter,
our great-aunt, she sent us.

847
01:04:30,486 --> 01:04:32,920
Lucy? She's only 6-and-a-half years old.

848
01:04:33,022 --> 01:04:36,617
No. No, she's 86-and-a-half.

849
01:04:39,295 --> 01:04:42,787
Well, that's nonsense.
I was with her only this morning.

850
01:04:44,667 --> 01:04:46,259
Or was that yesterday?

851
01:04:46,369 --> 01:04:48,701
No, that was 80 years ago!

852
01:04:49,505 --> 01:04:53,168
Listen, you gotta believe me.
You're my great-great-uncle.

853
01:04:54,844 --> 01:04:56,505
Help me out, guys.

854
01:04:57,447 --> 01:04:58,846
Guys?

855
01:04:58,948 --> 01:05:01,542
What's happening?
What's the matter with them?

856
01:05:01,651 --> 01:05:03,050
The sylphs.

857
01:05:03,152 --> 01:05:06,053
Their songs must have altered
my perception of time.

858
01:05:06,155 --> 01:05:07,918
That is what they do.

859
01:05:08,024 --> 01:05:10,652
Lucy's an old woman now, you say?

860
01:05:11,194 --> 01:05:13,560
That must mean that my wife is...

861
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:15,954
Oh, my God, what have I done?

862
01:05:16,065 --> 01:05:18,898
Look, I'm sorry about all that, really.

863
01:05:19,002 --> 01:05:20,663
But you gotta help us. I found your book.

864
01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:24,467
The field guide? No!
No, not here. Not now.

865
01:05:25,742 --> 01:05:27,505
Don't listen to them.

866
01:05:28,177 --> 01:05:29,508
Follow me.

867
01:05:35,318 --> 01:05:38,617
Here! Under here!
Quickly, while they're distracted.

868
01:05:42,225 --> 01:05:43,988
The book, give me the book.

869
01:05:44,093 --> 01:05:45,856
Oh, the field guide.

870
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:49,088
The field guide.

871
01:05:49,999 --> 01:05:51,523
You should never have read this.

872
01:05:51,634 --> 01:05:53,602
You should not have brought this
outside the circle.

873
01:05:53,703 --> 01:05:57,662
I know. I know, but I brought it to you
so you could destroy it.

874
01:05:58,474 --> 01:06:00,237
Destroy it?

875
01:06:00,343 --> 01:06:01,867
No. Are you mad?

876
01:06:01,978 --> 01:06:03,969
I have uncovered all of their secrets.

877
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:07,243
And this book is my validation.
This book is my life.

878
01:06:07,350 --> 01:06:10,979
You're 1 25 years old! Your life is over!

879
01:06:11,087 --> 01:06:13,078
And your daughter
spent her life without a father,

880
01:06:13,189 --> 01:06:15,180
all because of that book.

881
01:06:21,931 --> 01:06:23,899
I never imagined
that the things I'd learned

882
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,332
could possibly have led to this.

883
01:06:26,836 --> 01:06:30,567
Look, I know stuff I wish I didn't, too,

884
01:06:30,673 --> 01:06:33,642
but there's nothing I can do about that.

885
01:06:33,743 --> 01:06:37,543
One thing I know for sure
is that you gotta destroy that book.

886
01:06:43,586 --> 01:06:45,486
-What's this?
-What?

887
01:06:45,588 --> 01:06:47,556
-What's wrong?
-Where's my book?

888
01:06:47,657 --> 01:06:52,219
-What is this?
-Thimbletack, he switched the pages.

889
01:06:52,328 --> 01:06:54,728
But the real book
is still inside the circle. It's safe.

890
01:06:54,831 --> 01:06:57,197
-No, Mulgarath got pages.
-What?

891
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:00,167
-He'll break the circle as soon as...
-As soon as the moon rises, I know.

892
01:07:00,269 --> 01:07:02,931
That's when Mom will be getting home.
I gotta get back.

893
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:05,030
No! They won't let you leave.

894
01:07:05,141 --> 01:07:07,735
They'll keep you here for
the same reason they're keeping me.

895
01:07:07,844 --> 01:07:09,436
We know too much.

896
01:07:12,982 --> 01:07:16,850
Then what are we gonna do?
Please, you've gotta help us!

897
01:07:16,953 --> 01:07:21,049
If I'm as old as you say I am,
I'm useless outside this glade.

898
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:37,833
The last thing I said to my mom was,
"l hate you."

899
01:07:43,479 --> 01:07:45,310
Listen, son.

900
01:07:45,415 --> 01:07:48,043
The boy who had the tenacity
to find me,

901
01:07:48,151 --> 01:07:49,846
doesn't need my help.

902
01:07:49,952 --> 01:07:53,979
Now, Mulgarath wants the power
that comes with knowledge.

903
01:07:54,757 --> 01:07:56,748
You have that knowledge.

904
01:07:56,859 --> 01:07:58,622
You are the book now.

905
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,960
And you have to get out of here. Now.

906
01:08:11,073 --> 01:08:12,097
Yes!

907
01:08:12,809 --> 01:08:14,902
I think I can distract them.

908
01:08:15,745 --> 01:08:18,509
On my signal,
run to your brother and sister.

909
01:08:18,614 --> 01:08:20,707
You'll only have a few moments
to escape.

910
01:08:20,817 --> 01:08:22,944
-But...
-Await my signal.

911
01:08:23,052 --> 01:08:24,314
But...

912
01:08:25,087 --> 01:08:28,887
Here! Here! I have the field guide!

913
01:08:28,991 --> 01:08:31,118
Do you want it? Yes, here!

914
01:08:31,227 --> 01:08:34,458
Come take it!
You can keep it safe right here!

915
01:08:35,998 --> 01:08:37,124
Now!

916
01:08:55,351 --> 01:08:56,909
Yes, Byron! Yes!

917
01:08:57,019 --> 01:08:58,384
Get them home safely!

918
01:09:01,257 --> 01:09:03,555
Come on, snap out of it! Come on!

919
01:10:01,884 --> 01:10:02,685
Oh, shoot!
They started spreading the potion.

920
01:10:02,685 --> 01:10:04,778
Oh, shoot!
They started spreading the potion.

921
01:10:06,923 --> 01:10:08,652
Oh, no. There's Mom.

922
01:10:10,526 --> 01:10:12,619
-Mom! No! Turn around!
-Go away, Mom!

923
01:10:12,728 --> 01:10:14,127
Stop the car!

924
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:15,424
What?

925
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,867
-Mom, move over!
-What are you doing?

926
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:24,303
Mallory, you drive!
Get the car inside the circle!

927
01:10:25,841 --> 01:10:28,469
-Go, go!
-You're not driving this car!

928
01:10:28,578 --> 01:10:30,478
Stop it! Mal, stop!

929
01:10:38,554 --> 01:10:39,885
Thank God.

930
01:10:39,989 --> 01:10:42,184
Will someone please tell me
what's going on?

931
01:10:42,291 --> 01:10:44,759
-Jared, what do we do now?
-Protect the house.

932
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:46,794
-Simon, the sage in the planter boxes.
-I know, I know.

933
01:10:46,896 --> 01:10:48,261
-Hang them in the windows!
-I'm on it.

934
01:10:48,364 --> 01:10:50,491
Mal, go upstairs
and get all of Lucinda's salt.

935
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:51,726
-All of it?
-All of it!

936
01:10:51,834 --> 01:10:53,995
-Okay. Okay.
-Thimbletack!

937
01:10:54,103 --> 01:10:56,298
-Jared!
-Thimbletack!

938
01:10:56,405 --> 01:10:58,805
The circle's about to be broken!
Please come out!

939
01:10:58,908 --> 01:11:00,842
Jared! Jared! What is going on?

940
01:11:00,943 --> 01:11:03,377
-Mom, you've got to believe me. Okay?
-No! No!

941
01:11:03,479 --> 01:11:06,175
One more word about faeries
and goblins and I swear...

942
01:11:06,282 --> 01:11:08,773
Goblins, I know. But I hid the book.
They'll never find it.

943
01:11:08,884 --> 01:11:11,182
Well, I hope they don't. Unless...

944
01:11:11,821 --> 01:11:14,346
Why is she screaming?
I'm the one who should be screaming.

945
01:11:14,457 --> 01:11:16,186
The circle's about to be broken!

946
01:11:16,292 --> 01:11:18,590
Mom, no! He's not the problem.

947
01:11:19,862 --> 01:11:21,159
They are.

948
01:11:24,533 --> 01:11:26,728
Get in there! Get in there!

949
01:11:32,441 --> 01:11:35,205
We have to protect the house.
Understand?

950
01:11:38,914 --> 01:11:41,712
Hurry, hurry! Yeah, get every opening!

951
01:11:42,652 --> 01:11:44,643
Okay, the living room's done!

952
01:11:44,754 --> 01:11:47,917
-Simon, do the music room!
-Okay, okay, I got it!

953
01:11:48,624 --> 01:11:50,649
Steel, it cuts and burns.

954
01:11:51,994 --> 01:11:53,295
Good thing we're New Yorkers.

955
01:11:53,295 --> 01:11:54,193
Good thing we're New Yorkers.

956
01:11:58,067 --> 01:12:01,696
Wait, wait, here it comes.
Here it comes.

957
01:12:14,583 --> 01:12:16,175
The circle is broken.

958
01:12:16,285 --> 01:12:17,843
The circle is broken.

959
01:12:17,953 --> 01:12:21,389
The circle is broken! Attack!

960
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:39,373
The windows and doors are protected.

961
01:12:39,475 --> 01:12:41,443
Get down there. Go low! Go low!

962
01:12:41,544 --> 01:12:44,274
Break it! Break on through! Come on!

963
01:12:45,648 --> 01:12:48,082
The rest of you, up! Up, up, up!

964
01:12:48,184 --> 01:12:51,244
Go, you toads! Go! Find the book!

965
01:12:55,257 --> 01:12:56,918
Where did they go?

966
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:59,025
Did it work?

967
01:13:49,912 --> 01:13:52,472
Come on, Jared! Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

968
01:13:52,581 --> 01:13:54,640
Get back, Jared! Get back!

969
01:13:56,585 --> 01:13:58,712
Go, go, go! Run!

970
01:14:35,691 --> 01:14:38,125
Give it to me! Give it to me!

971
01:14:38,227 --> 01:14:40,161
-Simon, get the back door!
-I'm on it!

972
01:14:40,262 --> 01:14:41,786
Mal, help me!

973
01:14:45,968 --> 01:14:47,936
It won't hold for long.

974
01:14:49,839 --> 01:14:51,431
Give me a hand.

975
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:13,651
Go on! Get in there! Where did they go?

976
01:15:13,762 --> 01:15:16,390
Where are they? Where are they?
Come on, let's find them.

977
01:15:16,498 --> 01:15:18,989
You, over there, to the left.
You, to the right.

978
01:15:19,201 --> 01:15:20,896
Spread out, spread out.

979
01:15:33,682 --> 01:15:34,876
Oh...

980
01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:02,602
Are you okay?

981
01:16:06,215 --> 01:16:08,479
-lt worked.
-Yeah.

982
01:16:10,152 --> 01:16:11,676
Book safe?

983
01:16:11,787 --> 01:16:13,687
Yes. Good job, Thimbletack.

984
01:16:13,789 --> 01:16:15,120
Thank God.

985
01:16:18,827 --> 01:16:20,317
What is it?

986
01:16:20,429 --> 01:16:21,623
Come on.

987
01:16:34,243 --> 01:16:35,301
Dad?

988
01:16:37,413 --> 01:16:38,903
What happened?

989
01:16:39,014 --> 01:16:40,311
Richard?

990
01:16:40,416 --> 01:16:43,249
-What are you doing here?
-What's going on?

991
01:16:44,586 --> 01:16:46,247
Where do we start?

992
01:16:47,890 --> 01:16:49,585
With this, I guess.

993
01:16:50,926 --> 01:16:52,917
What's that? Let me see.

994
01:16:53,696 --> 01:16:54,685
No!

995
01:16:57,499 --> 01:17:00,332
Not until you tell me
what you need to tell me.

996
01:17:00,436 --> 01:17:01,630
What?

997
01:17:01,737 --> 01:17:04,797
The last time we were on the phone,
you said the next time we met,

998
01:17:04,907 --> 01:17:06,475
you had something
you needed to say to me.

999
01:17:06,475 --> 01:17:07,442
you had something
you needed to say to me.

1000
01:17:07,543 --> 01:17:09,443
So what is it?

1001
01:17:12,348 --> 01:17:15,215
Look me in the eyes and tell me.

1002
01:17:19,888 --> 01:17:22,152
I just want to hear you say it.

1003
01:17:24,994 --> 01:17:26,018
I...

1004
01:17:28,831 --> 01:17:31,698
I just wanted to tell you that I love you.

1005
01:17:35,304 --> 01:17:36,532
Let me see.

1006
01:17:39,808 --> 01:17:40,968
Jared.

1007
01:17:41,076 --> 01:17:42,270
Wrong answer.

1008
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:45,306
-Jared!
-Get back! Get back!

1009
01:17:45,414 --> 01:17:46,381
What did you do?

1010
01:17:46,482 --> 01:17:47,744
-It's not Dad!
-What?

1011
01:17:49,852 --> 01:17:51,319
Oh, my God!

1012
01:17:58,727 --> 01:18:02,493
Now give me the book!

1013
01:18:02,598 --> 01:18:04,225
Run, Jared!

1014
01:18:26,688 --> 01:18:28,553
Give me the book. Give me the book.

1015
01:18:43,338 --> 01:18:44,600
Back off!

1016
01:18:52,648 --> 01:18:54,115
Thimbletack!

1017
01:19:35,324 --> 01:19:37,292
Give me the book!

1018
01:19:47,402 --> 01:19:48,596
Jared!

1019
01:19:51,573 --> 01:19:54,064
Give me the book!

1020
01:19:59,515 --> 01:20:00,743
Oh, yeah.

1021
01:20:00,849 --> 01:20:02,874
Give me the book now!

1022
01:20:03,752 --> 01:20:05,652
-You want the book?
-Yeah.

1023
01:20:05,754 --> 01:20:07,221
Go get it!

1024
01:20:36,285 --> 01:20:38,219
Jared! Jared!

1025
01:20:39,721 --> 01:20:43,384
-Jared, are you okay?
-Jared, you did it.

1026
01:20:43,492 --> 01:20:46,427
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Jared, are you okay?

1027
01:20:47,930 --> 01:20:50,558
Yes! Death to the ogre!

1028
01:20:50,666 --> 01:20:54,625
We did it! You sent him right to me,
and I ate him! That's teamwork!

1029
01:20:54,736 --> 01:20:56,670
The taste of vengeance is sweet!

1030
01:20:56,772 --> 01:21:00,264
I can still taste a little! Oh, it's good!

1031
01:21:00,375 --> 01:21:04,471
I did it! I knew I could do it!
They said I couldn't, but I did it!

1032
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:07,777
-It's the field guide.
-Here, we'll help you.

1033
01:21:07,883 --> 01:21:09,111
Jared.

1034
01:21:12,854 --> 01:21:15,618
I'm sorry I didn't believe you. I mean...

1035
01:21:15,724 --> 01:21:17,385
No, I'm sorry.

1036
01:21:17,492 --> 01:21:20,188
-No, listen, l...
-For what I said, I didn't mean...

1037
01:21:20,295 --> 01:21:22,889
Jared, it's not your fault.

1038
01:21:22,998 --> 01:21:24,465
It's mine.

1039
01:21:25,167 --> 01:21:26,532
I was trying to protect you,

1040
01:21:26,635 --> 01:21:29,729
but I guess I should have
just told you the truth.

1041
01:21:30,472 --> 01:21:34,272
Your dad does love you,
and if you want to stay with him, that's...

1042
01:21:34,376 --> 01:21:36,571
I don't want to live with Dad.

1043
01:21:39,147 --> 01:21:42,878
Is it okay if I stay here with you?

1044
01:21:47,089 --> 01:21:48,613
Is it okay?

1045
01:21:52,194 --> 01:21:54,424
Who else is gonna protect us?

1046
01:22:13,148 --> 01:22:15,616
I'll go put this in your old room.

1047
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:27,155
My old friend Thimbletack.

1048
01:22:27,262 --> 01:22:28,923
Book safe, Lucy. Book safe.

1049
01:22:41,410 --> 01:22:43,207
And if my father were here,
he'd say, "Job well done."

1050
01:22:45,514 --> 01:22:46,981
Aunt Lucinda?

1051
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:51,150
I think you should come see this.

1052
01:23:32,861 --> 01:23:34,351
Am I dreaming?

1053
01:23:35,330 --> 01:23:37,696
No, my child. You're not.

1054
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:39,694
Child?

1055
01:23:40,669 --> 01:23:42,660
Do you know how old I am?

1056
01:23:43,338 --> 01:23:44,703
Yes, I do.

1057
01:23:45,173 --> 01:23:46,800
I'm so sorry.

1058
01:23:47,542 --> 01:23:50,636
I was so captivated by all
the magical creatures I found

1059
01:23:50,746 --> 01:23:53,647
that I lost sight of the one I already had.

1060
01:23:54,583 --> 01:23:56,210
But I see now,

1061
01:23:56,918 --> 01:23:59,785
and I may never be able
to forgive myself.

1062
01:24:01,156 --> 01:24:03,386
You came back as you promised,

1063
01:24:04,326 --> 01:24:05,987
so I forgive you.

1064
01:24:06,094 --> 01:24:09,552
My dear, because the book was saved,

1065
01:24:09,664 --> 01:24:12,155
the sylph allowed me to come see you,

1066
01:24:12,267 --> 01:24:15,031
but I cannot stay.

1067
01:24:16,271 --> 01:24:18,000
Because if I do,

1068
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:22,909
all my years will come back to me,
all at once, and I will turn to dust.

1069
01:24:27,716 --> 01:24:31,675
Then this time, take me with you.

1070
01:25:11,927 --> 01:25:13,224
Daddy.

1071
01:25:16,598 --> 01:25:18,031
Oh, Lucy.

1072
01:25:24,806 --> 01:25:26,740
-Come with me.
-Okay.

1073
01:26:31,573 --> 01:26:33,404
Hey, come on.

1074
01:26:42,384 --> 01:26:44,352
Fly while you can, griffin.

1075
01:26:44,452 --> 01:26:47,649
I swallowed an ogre whole.
You could be next.
