1
00:01:48,944 --> 00:01:50,344
TONI (VOICEOVER):
Louisiana's always

2
00:01:50,571 --> 00:01:54,242
been known for its good old
boy background politics.

3
00:01:54,534 --> 00:01:57,537
I just never thought I'd
get tangled up in it.

4
00:01:57,829 --> 00:01:59,581
Those press buzzard's
gotten more attention

5
00:01:59,873 --> 00:02:01,708
than a two-headed dog.

6
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,919
I started out in Shreveport,
Louisiana, living

7
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:07,506
in a row of houses that
all looked the same.

8
00:02:07,798 --> 00:02:09,842
It was across the street
from the rail road,

9
00:02:10,134 --> 00:02:13,220
because Daddy worked for the
Kansas City Southern Railways.

10
00:02:13,512 --> 00:02:16,098
After momma died, daddy
and my new step momma

11
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,060
began to take it out on me.

12
00:02:18,352 --> 00:02:19,227
So I left.

13
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:21,772
I was only 12.

14
00:02:22,064 --> 00:02:24,066
Aunt Emma took me
in for a spell 'til.

15
00:02:24,358 --> 00:02:26,318
Charlotte's became my new home.

16
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,365
I knew the one thing I had
going for me was my looks.

17
00:02:30,656 --> 00:02:33,951
I came in through the back
door as Annie B. McQuiston.

18
00:02:34,243 --> 00:02:37,121
But when I left in '39, it
was through the front door

19
00:02:37,413 --> 00:02:38,956
as Toni Jo Henry.

20
00:02:43,712 --> 00:02:45,964
[lively chatter]

21
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:50,135
Miss Charlotte ran the
place, better known

22
00:02:50,427 --> 00:02:53,807
as Charlotte's, the finest
brothel in Shreveport.

23
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:56,059
Miss Charlotte charmed
lawyers and the police

24
00:02:56,351 --> 00:02:59,145
in her back pocket by offering
her services for free.

25
00:03:04,526 --> 00:03:06,487
I never did learn
to play that piano,

26
00:03:06,779 --> 00:03:09,073
but I sure loved
the sound of it.

27
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:14,787
I dreamt for hours of a
better life, a different life.

28
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:16,640
I heard you lost
another fight cowboy.

29
00:03:16,705 --> 00:03:17,206
Yeah?

30
00:03:17,332 --> 00:03:18,250
Mm.

31
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:19,251
Well, you should
see the other guy.

32
00:03:19,543 --> 00:03:21,211
Mm.

33
00:03:21,503 --> 00:03:24,256
Besides, it's worth it if the
loser's purse gets me here.

34
00:03:24,548 --> 00:03:26,188
TONI (VOICEOVER): Every
little girl dreams

35
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:27,884
of her knight in shining armor.

36
00:03:28,176 --> 00:03:29,178
And I was no different.

37
00:03:32,682 --> 00:03:35,726
I just don't want to mess
up that pretty face of yours.

38
00:03:46,655 --> 00:03:47,615
Ladies, it's criminal.

39
00:03:47,906 --> 00:03:49,186
But I have got to
get some sleep.

40
00:03:49,408 --> 00:03:51,618
Goodnight.

41
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,204
Goodnight cowboy.

42
00:03:53,496 --> 00:03:55,165
Maybe I'll come cheer for
you on Saturday afternoon.

43
00:03:55,457 --> 00:03:57,041
You think Miss Charlotte
will give us the time off?

44
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:57,875
No.

45
00:04:02,547 --> 00:04:04,466
Don't you never
mind him, Toni Jo.

46
00:04:04,757 --> 00:04:07,720
You sure know how to make
a man feel like a man.

47
00:04:08,012 --> 00:04:10,389
Mr. Dupre is waiting for you.

48
00:04:10,681 --> 00:04:11,682
Just keep him happy.

49
00:04:15,603 --> 00:04:18,148
I just need to freshen up.

50
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:18,960
Yeah, sure.

51
00:04:32,914 --> 00:04:34,790
[gasp]

52
00:04:35,917 --> 00:04:36,417
Ah!

53
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,175
Ah!

54
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:45,219
[grunt]

55
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:05,032
Ah!

56
00:05:05,324 --> 00:05:06,033
Oh!

57
00:05:06,325 --> 00:05:07,535
Ah!

58
00:05:07,826 --> 00:05:09,453
Ah!

59
00:05:09,745 --> 00:05:10,245
Oh.

60
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,464
So how long have
you been fighting?

61
00:05:19,756 --> 00:05:21,716
Since I was born.

62
00:05:22,008 --> 00:05:24,594
Six older brothers, you get
plenty of sparring partners.

63
00:05:24,886 --> 00:05:26,930
That's a premium
right hook you got.

64
00:05:27,222 --> 00:05:29,684
One of the many tricks I
learned from the old man.

65
00:05:29,976 --> 00:05:31,269
Great role model.

66
00:05:31,561 --> 00:05:32,228
Yeah.

67
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,813
I had one of those too.

68
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,576
Well, I better get back.

69
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:47,619
Miss Charlotte will
be looking for me.

70
00:05:50,998 --> 00:05:52,165
I'd like to see you again.

71
00:05:52,457 --> 00:05:55,461
Well, you know where
Miss Charlotte's is.

72
00:05:55,753 --> 00:05:57,964
I meant away from there.

73
00:05:58,256 --> 00:06:00,550
Like where?

74
00:06:00,842 --> 00:06:01,523
What do you want?

75
00:06:04,095 --> 00:06:05,347
Just some dinner together.

76
00:06:09,143 --> 00:06:13,063
Seems like you're looking for
someone a little more polished.

77
00:06:13,355 --> 00:06:15,899
Well, who ain't?

78
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:19,154
But this point, I'd settle
or just a good looking cowboy

79
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:19,946
dude.

80
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,412
Lookie here, lookie here.

81
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,543
Hey now, I'm a paying customer.

82
00:06:36,297 --> 00:06:38,215
Put that down Toni Jo!

83
00:06:38,507 --> 00:06:41,386
Put it down.

84
00:06:41,678 --> 00:06:44,097
I'll fix you up Mr. Johnston.

85
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:45,223
Ain't no hog tie.

86
00:06:45,515 --> 00:06:46,235
Well, all right.

87
00:06:49,102 --> 00:06:50,103
[inaudible]?

88
00:06:50,395 --> 00:06:51,104
Come over here.

89
00:06:51,396 --> 00:06:52,189
[giggling]

90
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,290
(WHISPERING) Why don't
we go on upstairs?

91
00:06:58,321 --> 00:07:00,198
[laughing]

92
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:19,010
[music playing]

93
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,266
[cheering]

94
00:08:03,558 --> 00:08:04,559
You did good up there.

95
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:05,978
COWBOY: Tonight at least.

96
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,397
Usually, I end up with a
face full of hamburger.

97
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,357
[laughing]

98
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:13,152
Where's Toni Jo?

99
00:08:13,444 --> 00:08:15,112
Oh, she's upstairs.

100
00:08:15,404 --> 00:08:17,782
And she's alone cowboy.

101
00:08:18,074 --> 00:08:22,662
You sure have been taken up
all Toni Jo's time lately.

102
00:08:22,954 --> 00:08:24,247
And I pay for it, don't I?

103
00:08:36,594 --> 00:08:37,386
What are you doing?

104
00:08:37,678 --> 00:08:38,846
Nothing.

105
00:08:39,138 --> 00:08:39,805
Don't!

106
00:08:40,097 --> 00:08:40,597
Don't!

107
00:08:40,766 --> 00:08:41,683
I need that.

108
00:08:41,975 --> 00:08:43,135
You're a lying drug addict.

109
00:08:43,226 --> 00:08:43,935
Please!

110
00:08:44,227 --> 00:08:44,811
Please!

111
00:08:45,103 --> 00:08:46,063
What's it going to be?

112
00:08:46,313 --> 00:08:47,689
Me or this dope
monkey on your bed?

113
00:08:47,981 --> 00:08:48,857
But I need it.

114
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:49,649
I need it!

115
00:08:49,816 --> 00:08:50,336
You choose.

116
00:08:50,525 --> 00:08:50,901
You don't understand!

117
00:08:51,193 --> 00:08:51,693
I need it!

118
00:08:51,818 --> 00:08:52,318
Ah!

119
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:54,071
I can't!

120
00:08:54,489 --> 00:08:55,072
No!

121
00:08:55,448 --> 00:08:55,948
No!

122
00:08:56,199 --> 00:08:56,760
Give it to me.

123
00:08:56,908 --> 00:08:57,992
Give it.

124
00:08:58,409 --> 00:08:58,970
Give it to me!

125
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,660
Ah!

126
00:08:59,869 --> 00:09:00,453
Last chance.

127
00:09:00,745 --> 00:09:01,788
You choose.

128
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:04,875
[crying]

129
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:14,134
You don't have to
do it on your own.

130
00:09:18,181 --> 00:09:21,017
[crying]

131
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:32,655
Get away from me!

132
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,114
Get away from me!

133
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:35,115
No!

134
00:09:35,407 --> 00:09:36,575
I want momma!

135
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:37,743
Your momma's dead.

136
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,954
She can't help you
now, lazy brat.

137
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,207
Oh, where are you going?

138
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:41,998
Huh?

139
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:42,749
"Sorry!"

140
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,251
(MOCKINGLY) I'm sorry.

141
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:48,922
That's about the first
damn thing you said right.

142
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:50,507
Clean up this Pigs-TY!

143
00:10:11,572 --> 00:10:12,364
No!

144
00:10:12,656 --> 00:10:13,156
No!

145
00:10:13,365 --> 00:10:14,032
Come back here!

146
00:10:14,324 --> 00:10:15,868
Don't let me [inaudible]!

147
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:16,870
Come back!

148
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:18,371
Come back here!

149
00:10:18,663 --> 00:10:19,873
Come back!

150
00:10:20,164 --> 00:10:21,040
<i>No!</i>

151
00:10:21,332 --> 00:10:22,333
I'm not going back
in there again!

152
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,501
Don't go acting all
innocent with me.

153
00:10:23,793 --> 00:10:25,114
You're going to
service these men.

154
00:10:25,128 --> 00:10:26,129
Come on!

155
00:10:26,421 --> 00:10:27,463
Come on!

156
00:10:27,755 --> 00:10:29,466
(CRYING) I don't
have to listen to you!

157
00:10:29,758 --> 00:10:32,803
Do like the good book says,
honor thy father and mother.

158
00:10:33,095 --> 00:10:34,855
And I'm your momma now
little miss big mouth,

159
00:10:34,972 --> 00:10:35,773
so you listen to me.

160
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:36,682
Now get!

161
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,149
You're doing great.

162
00:10:44,441 --> 00:10:45,817
You're through the worst of it.

163
00:10:52,992 --> 00:10:56,037
Oh, I'm just so sorry your
momma went and died on you.

164
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:57,747
<i>I'll</i> be real good.

165
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:00,833
I'll clean the house real good,
and I'll fix my own dinner.

166
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,210
Is Bertha treating
you right darling?

167
00:11:03,502 --> 00:11:05,088
Those men smell
[inaudible] Emma.

168
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,467
Please don't make
me go back home!

169
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:10,886
Oh, it's all right child.

170
00:11:11,178 --> 00:11:14,097
You just say your prayers.

171
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:14,932
You'll see.

172
00:11:15,223 --> 00:11:17,226
It's going to be OK.

173
00:11:17,518 --> 00:11:19,395
Just sleep now.

174
00:11:19,687 --> 00:11:22,315
(WHISPERING) Shh.

175
00:11:22,607 --> 00:11:24,275
Sleep baby.

176
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:25,818
Just sleep.

177
00:11:37,206 --> 00:11:38,207
Slow down honey.

178
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:39,375
You're going to
make yourself sick.

179
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:40,948
Ain't nothing in
the world that's

180
00:11:41,002 --> 00:11:43,004
going to stop me from
eating right now.

181
00:11:43,296 --> 00:11:45,423
[laughing]

182
00:11:45,715 --> 00:11:48,385
Except maybe that.

183
00:11:48,677 --> 00:11:52,180
Let's do something
really crazy.

184
00:11:52,472 --> 00:11:54,600
Like what?

185
00:11:54,892 --> 00:11:55,693
Let's get hitched.

186
00:11:59,105 --> 00:12:00,398
What?

187
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,651
COWBOY: I want to do
right by you, Mrs. Henry.

188
00:12:03,943 --> 00:12:05,070
Toni Jo Henry.

189
00:12:05,362 --> 00:12:07,739
It has a nice ring to it.

190
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:09,071
Wait 'til the girl's here.

191
00:12:09,116 --> 00:12:11,785
They're going to be so jealous.

192
00:12:12,077 --> 00:12:15,330
And you're never going to set
foot in Miss Charlotte's again.

193
00:12:15,622 --> 00:12:17,333
You hear me?

194
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:21,004
Cowboy, don't be so silly.

195
00:12:21,295 --> 00:12:23,047
There could never
be anyone but you.

196
00:12:49,784 --> 00:12:50,577
All right.

197
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:52,287
Bring it in.

198
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,660
I don't have to tell you
boys how important this here

199
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,125
fight is.

200
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:57,752
The winners gets to go to
Beaumont for a whole series

201
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:59,378
of fights with the big boys.

202
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,464
Now, I want a clean, fair fight.

203
00:13:01,756 --> 00:13:02,965
Got it?

204
00:13:03,257 --> 00:13:03,799
All right.

205
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:04,467
Get in your corners.

206
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,343
Let's do it.

207
00:13:11,975 --> 00:13:13,810
[bell]

208
00:13:15,437 --> 00:13:16,229
Oh, sorry.

209
00:13:16,522 --> 00:13:19,233
Sorry.

210
00:13:19,525 --> 00:13:20,985
I can't believe
we're going to Texas!

211
00:13:24,947 --> 00:13:27,909
I'm not so sure
that's a good thing.

212
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:31,205
Well, you don't have a hair
on your ass if you don't go.

213
00:13:31,497 --> 00:13:32,206
[laughs]

214
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:37,211
Eh, thing is I got in a
little trouble in Texas.

215
00:13:37,503 --> 00:13:38,503
What's all the trouble?

216
00:13:38,504 --> 00:13:39,585
COWBOY: No big deal really.

217
00:13:39,797 --> 00:13:41,078
It happened so
long ago, probably

218
00:13:41,132 --> 00:13:42,175
nobody even remembers it.

219
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:43,718
Besides, we need the money.

220
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:48,098
TONI: Let's just hope no
one remembers it, dumb ass.

221
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:49,891
I guess the honeymoon's over.

222
00:13:50,183 --> 00:13:52,937
Well, I don't recall
ever having one.

223
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:54,855
You OK?

224
00:13:55,147 --> 00:13:58,776
Well then, Texas
will be our honeymoon.

225
00:13:59,068 --> 00:14:00,429
I'll make sure it's
worth the Wait.

226
00:14:09,788 --> 00:14:13,959
Well, ain't you a
sight for sore eyes.

227
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:15,291
When'd they let you out?

228
00:14:15,502 --> 00:14:16,022
Which time?

229
00:14:21,592 --> 00:14:23,136
Ain't you going to introduce me?

230
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:25,346
This is my Wife, Toni Jo.

231
00:14:25,638 --> 00:14:28,307
Toni Jo, this is Arkie.

232
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,102
What kind of a name is Arkie?

233
00:14:30,394 --> 00:14:31,854
I never thought
I'd see you ever

234
00:14:32,146 --> 00:14:33,689
settle down with just one gal.

235
00:14:33,981 --> 00:14:37,317
Well, it just goes
to show you, I guess.

236
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:41,156
Now listen, friend, I'll keep
your bride company tomorrow

237
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,949
while you fight,
give her a shoulder

238
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:44,742
to cry on when you lose.

239
00:14:45,034 --> 00:14:48,037
Eh... never could take a joke.

240
00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:49,789
[laughing]

241
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:52,918
It seems to me I got your ass
out of more than a few scrapes.

242
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,504
Sure you did.

243
00:14:55,796 --> 00:14:57,316
Claude ever tell you
about that time...

244
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,230
Shut up Arkie.

245
00:14:58,382 --> 00:14:58,924
Yeah.

246
00:14:59,216 --> 00:15:00,718
Too bad about Buck.

247
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:01,931
Let's go [inaudible].

248
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:03,262
See you around Arkie.

249
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:05,315
All's I'm saying is
Bonnie and Clyde should

250
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,471
have been treated that way.

251
00:15:06,641 --> 00:15:09,561
Got a light?

252
00:15:09,853 --> 00:15:12,522
The Bonnie and Clyde?

253
00:15:12,814 --> 00:15:14,941
Ah... you knew them?

254
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:16,944
The very ones, little lady.

255
00:15:17,236 --> 00:15:19,363
You never told her
about the Barrows?

256
00:15:19,655 --> 00:15:21,496
We've come here to check
out the competition,

257
00:15:21,574 --> 00:15:22,700
not shoot the breeze.

258
00:15:22,992 --> 00:15:24,327
No, I've got something
I've got to do anyway.

259
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:26,996
I'll see you around cowboy.

260
00:15:27,288 --> 00:15:29,583
By the way, no hard feelings
about screwing me over

261
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,418
on that last job, huh?

262
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,003
[laughing]

263
00:15:34,588 --> 00:15:35,964
[bell]

264
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:40,845
Oh, oh.

265
00:15:41,137 --> 00:15:43,848
Oh, oh, oh.

266
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:44,640
Uh.

267
00:15:51,522 --> 00:15:53,776
[grunting]

268
00:15:54,109 --> 00:15:54,610
Oh!

269
00:15:58,948 --> 00:16:06,949
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

270
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,209
That's it!

271
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,253
[cheering]

272
00:16:14,881 --> 00:16:15,674
There's my girl.

273
00:16:15,966 --> 00:16:16,717
Come here baby.

274
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,348
Let's get out of here.

275
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,391
Cowboy Henry?

276
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,062
Hey!

277
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:29,022
Hey!

278
00:16:29,314 --> 00:16:30,732
Get your hands off of him!

279
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:32,943
He won that fight
fair and square!

280
00:16:33,235 --> 00:16:34,736
It's all right baby.

281
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:37,489
We'll work this out, and I'll
be back before you know it.

282
00:16:37,781 --> 00:16:38,365
Sure.

283
00:16:38,657 --> 00:16:41,244
We'll work it all out.

284
00:16:41,536 --> 00:16:43,121
B but, but you can't take him.

285
00:16:43,413 --> 00:16:45,373
It's our honeymoon.

286
00:16:45,665 --> 00:16:47,345
You kill a policeman
in Texas, you either

287
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:48,793
swing or die in prison.

288
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:57,386
Will the defendant please rise.

289
00:16:57,678 --> 00:17:00,055
Since you've been found
guilty of manslaughter,

290
00:17:00,347 --> 00:17:04,018
you're hereby sentenced
to 50 years hard labor

291
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:06,187
at the Hudsville
State Penitentiary.

292
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:07,522
[gasp]

293
00:17:07,814 --> 00:17:10,275
Bailiff, remove the prisoner.

294
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:12,567
Don't worry baby, I'm
going to get you an appeal.

295
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,391
I won't let you
down, I promise.

296
00:17:15,613 --> 00:17:16,894
Just don't do anything stupid.

297
00:17:17,116 --> 00:17:18,117
I love you cowboy!

298
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:20,161
COWBOY: I love you too Toni Jo!

299
00:17:26,751 --> 00:17:28,072
That was a right
fine cheese grit.

300
00:17:28,337 --> 00:17:29,004
Thank you.

301
00:17:29,296 --> 00:17:30,088
Bye bye.

302
00:17:35,385 --> 00:17:36,506
You gonna eat them taters?

303
00:17:41,517 --> 00:17:44,729
Hard to know when
you'll eat next.

304
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:46,356
Can we just talk
about the plan?

305
00:17:46,647 --> 00:17:47,357
Mm.

306
00:17:47,648 --> 00:17:50,026
How much money do you have?

307
00:17:50,318 --> 00:17:54,865
They didn't pay him for
his last fight, bastards.

308
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,278
ARKIE: That don't seem fair.

309
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,370
$50.

310
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,877
That's not bad.

311
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:08,797
TONI: What about you?

312
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,690
I ain't got a pot
to piss in right now,

313
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:15,095
but that's getting
ready to change.

314
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:17,139
Great.

315
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,273
Did you and cowboy really
run with Bonnie and Clyde?

316
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:29,027
Well, now, I was the
one who introduced cowboy

317
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:31,822
to Buck Barrow when We
was all in Huntsville.

318
00:18:32,114 --> 00:18:34,408
When we got out,
pulled a couple bank

319
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:36,060
jobs to get Buck
some money so he'd

320
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:39,246
catch up with his brother Clyde.

321
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:42,083
How many banks?

322
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,167
I don't remember.

323
00:18:46,212 --> 00:18:46,712
Hm.

324
00:18:53,137 --> 00:18:53,637
Come here.

325
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:05,108
You know, me and you
could rob a bank.

326
00:19:07,944 --> 00:19:10,405
There's a bank, this
little town, Harrell,

327
00:19:10,697 --> 00:19:14,367
Arkansas nearabouts
where I grew up.

328
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:16,328
How do we get to
Harrell, Arkansas?

329
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,831
We'll get us a car.

330
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:19,999
Get a car?

331
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,571
Actually, you'll get us a car.

332
00:19:21,584 --> 00:19:23,544
But leave it up to me.

333
00:19:23,836 --> 00:19:25,296
I'll be in charge of the gun.

334
00:19:25,588 --> 00:19:28,028
You can be the getaway driver,
just like Bonnie did for Clyde.

335
00:19:33,263 --> 00:19:38,059
I don't know nothing about guns
and never learned how to drive.

336
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:39,186
<i>I'll</i> learn you.

337
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:40,313
It ain't that hard.

338
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:47,069
I think I know somebody
who can help with the guns.

339
00:19:56,538 --> 00:19:57,619
This'll just take a second.

340
00:20:08,635 --> 00:20:10,011
Oh, we got us plenty of guns.

341
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,394
Damn bastard only gave
us bullets for one gun.

342
00:20:17,686 --> 00:20:18,771
Hey!

343
00:20:19,063 --> 00:20:20,689
Well, it seems to
me we only need one.

344
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:26,487
Yeah.

345
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:29,908
Still need a car.

346
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,121
Let's Walk the highway.

347
00:20:39,876 --> 00:20:42,129
Come on.

348
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:43,631
You be nice to this guy.

349
00:20:43,923 --> 00:20:44,883
I'll hide in the bushes.

350
00:20:44,924 --> 00:20:45,341
I'll be right there.

351
00:20:45,633 --> 00:20:46,133
TONI: OK.

352
00:20:57,354 --> 00:21:00,148
JP: You shouldn't be out
here all alone young lady.

353
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:01,566
Dangerous.

354
00:21:04,195 --> 00:21:05,655
Where you headed?

355
00:21:05,947 --> 00:21:09,367
Actually, my brother and I
are on our way to Arkansas.

356
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:11,911
Where you headed?

357
00:21:12,203 --> 00:21:13,643
Well, I was
delivering this new car

358
00:21:13,913 --> 00:21:16,195
to a friend of mine who lives
over in Jennings, Louisiana.

359
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:19,044
I generally don't like to
travel on the lord's clay, but...

360
00:21:19,336 --> 00:21:22,298
Well, that's part way.

361
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,341
What do you say?

362
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:26,051
[sighs]

363
00:21:26,343 --> 00:21:28,805
Well, I suppose I could take
you all as far as Jennings.

364
00:21:29,097 --> 00:21:29,681
Hop on in.

365
00:21:29,973 --> 00:21:31,141
Thank you!

366
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:33,234
[inaudible] right,
right nice of you mister.

367
00:21:35,353 --> 00:21:36,438
Don't forget your bags sis.

368
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,897
Oh, thank you.

369
00:21:38,189 --> 00:21:40,651
You're welcome.

370
00:21:40,943 --> 00:21:42,111
TONI: You got everything?

371
00:21:42,403 --> 00:21:42,903
Yeah.

372
00:21:43,195 --> 00:21:43,571
ARKIE: All right.

373
00:21:43,863 --> 00:21:44,363
TONI: Yeah?

374
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,030
ARKIE: Yeah.

375
00:21:45,156 --> 00:21:46,073
Let's go.

376
00:21:46,365 --> 00:21:47,408
JP: It's a beautiful
day, isn't it?

377
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,261
TONI: Sure is.

378
00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:49,009
ARKIE: Sure is.

379
00:21:49,035 --> 00:21:49,577
No rain.

380
00:21:52,497 --> 00:21:53,749
So what's your name?

381
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,667
My name's Joseph P. Galloway.

382
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:58,587
Friends call me JP.

383
00:21:58,879 --> 00:22:00,213
Well, it's nice to meet you JP.

384
00:22:00,505 --> 00:22:01,025
My name is...

385
00:22:01,298 --> 00:22:04,135
My name is Clyde.

386
00:22:04,427 --> 00:22:05,637
It's nice to meet you Clyde.

387
00:22:08,765 --> 00:22:09,390
[coughs]

388
00:22:11,768 --> 00:22:13,061
So what's your line JP?

389
00:22:13,353 --> 00:22:17,524
I own a car dealership
back in Houston.

390
00:22:17,816 --> 00:22:19,109
Ain't you the lucky one?

391
00:22:19,401 --> 00:22:20,778
No ma'am.

392
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,311
That lord has shown his smiling
face on me and my family.

393
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:28,953
That's real nice.

394
00:22:29,245 --> 00:22:29,954
Yes ma'am.

395
00:22:30,246 --> 00:22:31,039
We're blessed.

396
00:22:48,974 --> 00:22:50,142
No ma'am.

397
00:22:50,434 --> 00:22:52,155
I don't think you'll
find much way out here.

398
00:22:52,187 --> 00:22:52,687
It's a...

399
00:22:52,813 --> 00:22:53,313
Perfect.

400
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:54,481
Just take it easy.

401
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,900
Pull over to the
side of the road.

402
00:22:57,192 --> 00:22:59,111
Mister, I don't
want any trouble, OK?

403
00:22:59,403 --> 00:23:01,238
Well, maybe too
late for that JP.

404
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:02,656
Just pull on over JP.

405
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,075
JP: Yes sir.

406
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:05,493
ARKIE: Get out.

407
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:08,162
Come on, let's go.

408
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:09,934
Empty out your pockets
right up there.

409
00:23:10,081 --> 00:23:10,665
Come on!

410
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:11,457
Go.

411
00:23:11,582 --> 00:23:12,333
Come on.

412
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:13,626
Let's go.

413
00:23:13,918 --> 00:23:14,919
You can have the money.

414
00:23:15,211 --> 00:23:15,731
Just take it.

415
00:23:15,878 --> 00:23:16,379
OK?

416
00:23:16,505 --> 00:23:17,172
Take it.

417
00:23:24,555 --> 00:23:25,723
This is what you've got?

418
00:23:26,014 --> 00:23:26,765
Yes.

419
00:23:27,057 --> 00:23:27,725
I don't travel with much money.

420
00:23:28,017 --> 00:23:28,601
Shut up.

421
00:23:28,893 --> 00:23:29,310
Take that watch off too.

422
00:23:29,602 --> 00:23:30,186
Hey sis?

423
00:23:30,478 --> 00:23:31,318
Open the turtle back.

424
00:23:31,521 --> 00:23:32,856
Maybe there's money in there.

425
00:23:33,148 --> 00:23:33,648
What?

426
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,501
The the trunk.

427
00:23:34,649 --> 00:23:35,859
Just open it!

428
00:23:36,151 --> 00:23:37,235
Come on.

429
00:23:37,527 --> 00:23:38,445
Well, how am I supposed
to know that Arkie?

430
00:23:38,737 --> 00:23:41,115
I already told
you, I don't drive!

431
00:23:41,407 --> 00:23:43,367
Mmister, I won't say
anything, I promise!

432
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:45,119
I promise, I won't say anything!

433
00:23:45,411 --> 00:23:46,912
Really.

434
00:23:47,204 --> 00:23:49,498
That's swell.

435
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,290
All right.

436
00:23:50,499 --> 00:23:50,999
Come on.

437
00:23:53,587 --> 00:23:54,629
Just please don't kill me.

438
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:55,421
Come on!

439
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,339
Come on POPS!

440
00:23:56,631 --> 00:23:57,090
Please just don't kill me!

441
00:23:57,382 --> 00:23:57,982
Get in there!

442
00:23:58,008 --> 00:23:58,508
Get!

443
00:23:58,633 --> 00:23:59,133
Get!

444
00:23:59,259 --> 00:23:59,759
Double time!

445
00:24:00,761 --> 00:24:01,970
Ah!

446
00:24:02,429 --> 00:24:03,931
Sorry JP.

447
00:24:04,223 --> 00:24:04,974
JP: Ah!

448
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:06,546
What'd you go and do that for?

449
00:24:06,642 --> 00:24:07,685
He didn't step it up
in the first place,

450
00:24:07,977 --> 00:24:08,770
he wouldn't have gotten
his hands smashed.

451
00:24:09,061 --> 00:24:09,854
Come on, let's go!

452
00:24:14,358 --> 00:24:14,859
Come on!

453
00:24:15,151 --> 00:24:15,651
Let's go!

454
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,371
Hey, pipe down back there.

455
00:24:26,663 --> 00:24:27,206
[sighs]

456
00:24:27,498 --> 00:24:28,249
OK.

457
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:29,741
We can't take him to Arkansas.

458
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:30,877
He's making too much
noise back here.

459
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:32,712
Find a spot alongside the road.

460
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,381
I don't remember kidnapping
being part of the plan.

461
00:24:35,673 --> 00:24:36,794
Things change sweetie pie.

462
00:24:36,966 --> 00:24:39,803
You have to learn
to use your noggin.

463
00:24:40,095 --> 00:24:42,348
What's eating you?

464
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,432
Cool off, will you?

465
00:24:43,724 --> 00:24:44,444
JP (IN TRUNK): Oh.

466
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,772
Nice car, huh?

467
00:24:50,064 --> 00:24:52,025
Bet you wish you could drive it.

468
00:24:52,317 --> 00:24:53,037
JP (IN TRUNK): Oh.

469
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:57,531
Listen.

470
00:24:57,823 --> 00:24:58,615
Don't touch me.

471
00:24:58,907 --> 00:25:00,283
Listen.

472
00:25:00,575 --> 00:25:01,496
You through in with me.

473
00:25:01,535 --> 00:25:02,244
We're partners.

474
00:25:02,536 --> 00:25:03,617
At least 'til the bank job.

475
00:25:03,745 --> 00:25:05,146
So you ought to
make the best of it.

476
00:25:05,414 --> 00:25:07,291
You want to free
cowboy, don't you?

477
00:25:11,254 --> 00:25:13,965
JP (IN TRUNK): Oh.

478
00:25:14,257 --> 00:25:15,968
Driving doesn't
look all that hard.

479
00:25:19,513 --> 00:25:22,307
Maybe I could be
the getaway driver.

480
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:23,439
That's your ticket.

481
00:25:35,238 --> 00:25:37,574
JP (IN TRUNK): [moaning]

482
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,995
Ah!

483
00:25:41,287 --> 00:25:41,887
Now, come on.

484
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:42,760
Get out of there.

485
00:25:42,872 --> 00:25:43,539
Come on!

486
00:25:43,831 --> 00:25:44,832
Oh.

487
00:25:45,124 --> 00:25:45,708
[grunting]

488
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,167
How's your hands JP?

489
00:25:50,671 --> 00:25:53,550
Lulu's going to
be worried sick.

490
00:25:53,842 --> 00:25:55,302
Be OK.

491
00:25:55,594 --> 00:25:56,553
All right.

492
00:25:56,845 --> 00:25:57,725
Take your clothes off.

493
00:25:57,762 --> 00:25:58,930
Wha what'd you say?

494
00:25:59,222 --> 00:25:59,783
What'd he say?

495
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:00,531
You heard me.

496
00:26:00,765 --> 00:26:02,309
Now.

497
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:03,101
Come on!

498
00:26:03,351 --> 00:26:03,895
Ah.

499
00:26:04,186 --> 00:26:05,521
It'll slow him down.

500
00:26:05,813 --> 00:26:06,689
I don't want him running for
help soon as we drive off.

501
00:26:06,981 --> 00:26:08,649
[grunting]

502
00:26:10,526 --> 00:26:12,846
You two know you could end
up in a penitentiary for this,

503
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,405
don't you?

504
00:26:14,697 --> 00:26:16,899
Listen mister, you'd better
shut up and do what he says.

505
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,618
Come on!

506
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,660
Let's go!

507
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,871
[inaudible], take the gun.

508
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:22,414
Keep it trained on him.

509
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,250
Son, think about
what you're doing.

510
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,879
Don't kill me.

511
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:29,756
ARKIE: Get up.

512
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:31,090
I, I said get up.

513
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:33,343
Toni Jo, come on.

514
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:34,928
TONI: What are you doing?

515
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:37,764
JP: I'm praying for myself
and for your eternal soul.

516
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:40,100
TONI: I don't need
your stinking prayers.

517
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:42,645
ARKIE: Toni Jo, give me the gun.

518
00:26:42,937 --> 00:26:44,688
[gun shot]

519
00:26:51,153 --> 00:26:52,280
Have you read this?

520
00:26:55,909 --> 00:26:57,202
Where'd they find the body?

521
00:26:57,494 --> 00:26:59,996
Over in [inaudible] rice
farm behind a haystack.

522
00:27:00,288 --> 00:27:03,124
Poor guy's totally nude.

523
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:05,086
Did Clemet file a report?

524
00:27:05,378 --> 00:27:06,299
Not his final report.

525
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:11,570
There's more.

526
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:19,101
There was a leak
to the newspaper

527
00:27:19,393 --> 00:27:21,603
that the guy was brutally
tortured with a pair of pliers

528
00:27:21,895 --> 00:27:24,064
before he was slain,
sexually mutilated.

529
00:27:24,356 --> 00:27:24,856
Jeez.

530
00:27:25,065 --> 00:27:26,108
Did she confess?

531
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,902
She clammed up at the inquest.

532
00:27:28,194 --> 00:27:29,714
One look at the jury
and the spectator,

533
00:27:29,821 --> 00:27:31,906
she refused to answer any
of Clement's questions.

534
00:27:32,198 --> 00:27:35,410
But she was indicted?

535
00:27:35,702 --> 00:27:36,995
She give up her accomplice?

536
00:27:37,286 --> 00:27:40,624
She refers to him as
the little yellow rat.

537
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:42,918
We're arranging for her
to go to Beaumont to visit

538
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:46,463
with her husband, Cowboy Henry.

539
00:27:46,755 --> 00:27:48,275
So she's receiving
special treatment?

540
00:27:48,424 --> 00:27:50,509
In exchange for the name.

541
00:27:50,801 --> 00:27:53,596
Her husband's serving time at
Huntsville for manslaughter,

542
00:27:53,888 --> 00:27:55,682
killing a former policeman.

543
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:58,518
Nice couple.

544
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,104
I don't like this whole business
of them getting together.

545
00:28:01,396 --> 00:28:03,036
That's the only Way
she would cooperate.

546
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:08,779
Let's keep this whole
mess under wraps.

547
00:28:09,071 --> 00:28:11,824
Have you appointed
counsel for her yet?

548
00:28:12,116 --> 00:28:14,035
Yep.

549
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:16,621
Those two young tax attorneys.

550
00:28:16,913 --> 00:28:19,082
[laughing]

551
00:28:21,626 --> 00:28:25,130
I messed up real
good this time.

552
00:28:25,422 --> 00:28:27,800
(WHISPERING) I really messed up.

553
00:28:28,092 --> 00:28:29,552
Give up Arkie.

554
00:28:29,844 --> 00:28:30,724
It's your only chance.

555
00:28:36,225 --> 00:28:37,268
Our only chance.

556
00:29:06,884 --> 00:29:08,324
They want me to
look at some books.

557
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:13,849
Give them what they want sugar.

558
00:29:14,141 --> 00:29:15,222
What's Arkie's real name?

559
00:29:17,771 --> 00:29:19,356
I don't know.

560
00:29:19,648 --> 00:29:23,568
He just went by so many names,
we always called him Arkie.

561
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:30,660
I love you cowboy.

562
00:29:30,952 --> 00:29:32,245
(WHISPERING) I love you too.

563
00:29:38,876 --> 00:29:42,256
[crying]

564
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:49,304
Calloway was a
close friend of mine.

565
00:29:49,596 --> 00:29:50,848
I want the death penalty.

566
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,518
I understand and agree.

567
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:55,730
I've arranged for
Calloway's widow and daughter

568
00:29:55,812 --> 00:29:57,605
to be here for the trial.

569
00:29:57,897 --> 00:29:59,738
Make sure you prep him
well before Wednesday.

570
00:29:59,858 --> 00:30:01,776
I want the jury's sympathy.

571
00:30:02,068 --> 00:30:04,697
Oh, they're as anxious to
see these two swing as we are.

572
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:24,009
Miss Henry?

573
00:30:24,301 --> 00:30:25,677
Your lawyers are
here to see you.

574
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,767
That no good yellow rat.

575
00:30:32,059 --> 00:30:32,810
Figures.

576
00:30:33,102 --> 00:30:34,302
Arkie put all the blame on me.

577
00:30:37,273 --> 00:30:39,442
Miss Henry, [inaudible]
about a court to defend you.

578
00:30:39,735 --> 00:30:41,945
May we have a
moment of your time?

579
00:30:42,237 --> 00:30:43,277
My name is Clement Moss.

580
00:30:43,363 --> 00:30:43,863
This is...

581
00:30:44,072 --> 00:30:44,753
Norman Ander...

582
00:30:44,865 --> 00:30:45,585
Norman Anderson.

583
00:30:45,657 --> 00:30:47,117
Norman Anderson.

584
00:30:47,409 --> 00:30:48,577
May we call you Annie?

585
00:30:48,869 --> 00:30:51,288
I don't go by that sissy
name in your report.

586
00:30:51,581 --> 00:30:52,207
[inaudible].

587
00:30:52,498 --> 00:30:53,499
It's Toni Jo.

588
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:55,919
Let me get y'all
a couple of chairs.

589
00:30:56,211 --> 00:30:57,337
Thank you.

590
00:30:57,629 --> 00:30:58,149
[inaudible].

591
00:31:03,051 --> 00:31:04,929
Well, don't worry.

592
00:31:05,221 --> 00:31:05,741
I don't bite.

593
00:31:10,184 --> 00:31:10,935
I just use pliers.

594
00:31:17,192 --> 00:31:19,444
Let's make something real
clear from the get go.

595
00:31:19,736 --> 00:31:21,363
These newspapers
are full of crap.

596
00:31:21,655 --> 00:31:23,865
There was no torture.

597
00:31:24,157 --> 00:31:26,660
Y'all just holler when uh,
your business is done here.

598
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:27,452
Yes sir.

599
00:31:27,745 --> 00:31:28,245
Will do.

600
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:34,919
So what number am I?

601
00:31:35,211 --> 00:31:36,879
S excuse me?

602
00:31:37,171 --> 00:31:39,012
Well, how many murder
cases have y'all tried?

603
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,968
Well, actually, this
is our very first one.

604
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,344
First one.

605
00:31:42,636 --> 00:31:43,887
CLEMENT: We filed a
motion with the judge

606
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:45,472
to be withdrawn from the case.

607
00:31:45,764 --> 00:31:46,890
We're tax attorneys.

608
00:31:47,182 --> 00:31:50,185
(WHISPERING) Tax attorneys?

609
00:31:50,477 --> 00:31:51,646
He denied our motion.

610
00:31:51,938 --> 00:31:53,739
It couldn't have come
for a worse time for us.

611
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,941
I mean...

612
00:31:55,233 --> 00:31:55,942
He's finishing up this
year's tax returns.

613
00:31:56,234 --> 00:31:57,355
NORMAN:... both our returns.

614
00:31:57,402 --> 00:31:58,278
Well, I wasn't
actually planning

615
00:31:58,569 --> 00:31:59,849
on filing a tax
return this year,

616
00:31:59,988 --> 00:32:01,708
so I guess I won't be
needing your services.

617
00:32:05,035 --> 00:32:07,621
We can understand your concern
and hesitation about us,

618
00:32:07,913 --> 00:32:09,248
but we want to
assure you, we will

619
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,381
do everything possible
to get you a fair trial.

620
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,460
NORMAN: Yes.

621
00:32:13,752 --> 00:32:15,505
Fair trial?

622
00:32:16,298 --> 00:32:16,798
Sure.

623
00:32:25,348 --> 00:32:29,103
Well, so let's have it.

624
00:32:29,395 --> 00:32:32,189
What have y'all come
up with for my defense?

625
00:32:32,481 --> 00:32:33,149
Oh.

626
00:32:33,441 --> 00:32:39,238
Um, sorry, just... uh, OK.

627
00:32:39,531 --> 00:32:41,908
Um, first We have to
pick the right jury.

628
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,040
And then we have to...

629
00:32:43,076 --> 00:32:44,202
Yeah, right.

630
00:32:44,494 --> 00:32:45,746
Read the papers.

631
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:48,248
They have me swinging before
the trial even begins.

632
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:51,001
Norman and I brought that to
the attention of the court.

633
00:32:51,293 --> 00:32:53,212
We asked the judge to
change the location

634
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,384
of the venue of the trial,
because of all the...

635
00:32:55,465 --> 00:32:56,386
Because of the press.

636
00:32:56,466 --> 00:32:57,267
But it was denied.

637
00:32:59,594 --> 00:33:02,430
Well, it looks like I'm
screwed every which way.

638
00:33:02,722 --> 00:33:03,724
[laughs]

639
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,185
Not entirely.

640
00:33:06,477 --> 00:33:08,557
Our motion to have your case
severed from [inaudible]

641
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:11,065
Was granted.

642
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:15,945
S... severed means your
trials will be separated.

643
00:33:16,237 --> 00:33:17,038
That's a good thing.

644
00:33:17,197 --> 00:33:17,957
That's very good.

645
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:18,531
It's good.

646
00:33:22,952 --> 00:33:26,915
We we need uh,
information about your past.

647
00:33:27,207 --> 00:33:29,418
Yes, we want to establish
a, your background.

648
00:33:32,713 --> 00:33:35,174
I don't need people
feeling all sorry for me.

649
00:33:35,466 --> 00:33:37,468
Well, actually, you do.

650
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,178
It's part of your defense.

651
00:33:39,471 --> 00:33:42,057
I ain't airing out my dirty
laundry for them holy rollers.

652
00:33:42,349 --> 00:33:43,892
Some of those
holy rollers might

653
00:33:44,184 --> 00:33:45,944
have sympathy for you
because of your history

654
00:33:46,061 --> 00:33:47,896
and actually be against
the death penalty.

655
00:33:51,943 --> 00:33:53,319
A fat chance.

656
00:34:03,287 --> 00:34:03,808
That's her.

657
00:34:11,171 --> 00:34:12,851
Miss Galloway, would
you make a statement

658
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:15,291
concerning Mrs. Henry's trial
which opens here tomorrow?

659
00:34:15,468 --> 00:34:18,805
Naturally, everyone must know
how I feel about the matter.

660
00:34:19,097 --> 00:34:19,737
REPORTER: Ma'am?

661
00:34:19,764 --> 00:34:22,267
Ma'am?

662
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:24,644
Mr. Copeland, Mr. Copeland.

663
00:34:24,936 --> 00:34:26,980
Can I get a statement
from your Mr. Copeland?

664
00:34:27,272 --> 00:34:30,401
We, referring to Mrs.
Galloway and her daughter,

665
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,069
will insist upon
the death penalty

666
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,238
for both the man and the woman.

667
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,241
And I cannot see or understand
how a jury could assess

668
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,013
anything other than
the death penalty.

669
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,163
You could quote me on that.

670
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:42,873
REPORTER: Give a quote here sir?

671
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:43,706
Ma'am?

672
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:52,008
[whispered chatter]

673
00:34:56,596 --> 00:34:58,890
Understand Pete,
you make a call.

674
00:34:59,182 --> 00:35:01,350
I'm just, what I'm
saying is you have to...

675
00:35:01,642 --> 00:35:04,229
Order in my courtroom.

676
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:06,064
Proceed with jury selection.

677
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:09,151
Ah, Mr. Albert Stokes.

678
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:12,404
Mr Stokes, I'd like to ask
you that if you were satisfied

679
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:15,867
beyond any reasonable doubt
that the defendant is guilty,

680
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:19,245
could you vote for
the death penalty?

681
00:35:19,537 --> 00:35:20,663
Yes sir, I could.

682
00:35:20,955 --> 00:35:22,556
PROSECUTOR: The state
accepts this juror.

683
00:35:26,544 --> 00:35:28,047
Um, Mr. Stokes?

684
00:35:28,339 --> 00:35:29,215
[clears throat]

685
00:35:29,507 --> 00:35:31,091
Uh, Mr. Stokes,
if you're accepted

686
00:35:31,383 --> 00:35:35,471
as a defendant in this case,
uh, uh, as a juror in this case,

687
00:35:35,763 --> 00:35:38,015
and if, if the jury
should determine

688
00:35:38,307 --> 00:35:41,853
that the defendant
was guilty of murder,

689
00:35:42,145 --> 00:35:44,064
would you be able to
give uh, consideration...

690
00:35:44,356 --> 00:35:46,691
Your honor, would you kindly
direct my learned colleague

691
00:35:46,983 --> 00:35:48,026
to speak up?

692
00:35:48,318 --> 00:35:49,402
The people of the great
state of Louisiana

693
00:35:49,694 --> 00:35:51,174
would like to hear
what he has to say.

694
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,907
Mr. Anderson, speak up.

695
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:55,326
Yes sir... (LOUDER)
Yes sir, your honor.

696
00:35:55,618 --> 00:35:58,538
Wo... would you be able to give
consideration to a verdict

697
00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:00,029
other than capital punishment.

698
00:36:00,248 --> 00:36:03,335
That is to say,
life imprisonment?

699
00:36:03,669 --> 00:36:04,169
Yes sir.

700
00:36:06,922 --> 00:36:10,884
Would the opinion that you
have formed uh, accounts

701
00:36:11,176 --> 00:36:14,555
or discussions, you may have had
about the case with, you know,

702
00:36:14,846 --> 00:36:20,812
with you know, the mailman,
the milkman, the vegetable man,

703
00:36:21,104 --> 00:36:24,816
or, or, you know, the boys
at the hardware store,

704
00:36:25,108 --> 00:36:27,611
or church people
say, or you know,

705
00:36:27,903 --> 00:36:30,698
whoever the...
whoever really would

706
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,700
have a conversation
about the case with you

707
00:36:32,992 --> 00:36:35,995
with that case, the
discussions about it,

708
00:36:36,287 --> 00:36:37,663
uh, easily affect your views?

709
00:36:37,955 --> 00:36:40,584
Does the opinion that you
form easily effect your views?

710
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:42,544
It would.

711
00:36:42,836 --> 00:36:43,336
[coughs]

712
00:36:43,503 --> 00:36:45,213
Thank you.

713
00:36:45,505 --> 00:36:46,905
Look, your honor,
the defense asks

714
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:48,383
that this juror be excused.

715
00:36:48,675 --> 00:36:51,011
I see no reason why Mr Stokes
cannot serve as a juror.

716
00:36:51,304 --> 00:36:54,348
He is accepted.

717
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,224
Next?

718
00:36:55,516 --> 00:36:56,437
Your honor, I object.

719
00:36:56,517 --> 00:36:57,017
Overruled.

720
00:37:03,984 --> 00:37:05,736
Pay him no attention.

721
00:37:06,028 --> 00:37:06,820
Oh, never mind.

722
00:37:09,448 --> 00:37:12,618
The state is satisfied
with the jury.

723
00:37:12,909 --> 00:37:13,702
Oh, your honor?

724
00:37:13,994 --> 00:37:15,663
The defense is not satis...

725
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,817
Your honor, I object.

726
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:45,278
On what grounds?

727
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:48,198
[inaudible], I'd like to
introduce the Texas enterprise

728
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:49,770
and late Charles American press.

729
00:37:49,991 --> 00:37:51,672
But your honor, in
these news... thank you.

730
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,746
In these newspapers, Mr.
Copeland and Miss Galloway

731
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:55,539
have made remarks
indicating that they

732
00:37:55,831 --> 00:37:58,918
will settle for nothing
less than a hanging verdict.

733
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,610
(WHISPERING) And
if they are allowed

734
00:38:00,753 --> 00:38:02,193
to sit directly in
front of the jury,

735
00:38:02,296 --> 00:38:03,757
it is with the sole purpose
of arousing sympathy.

736
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:06,385
I therefore request they be
moved to outside the rail.

737
00:38:06,677 --> 00:38:07,386
Overruled.

738
00:38:07,678 --> 00:38:08,345
They're fine where they are.

739
00:38:08,637 --> 00:38:09,637
Take a seat Mr. Anderson.

740
00:38:22,068 --> 00:38:24,404
Mr. Paterson, are
you ready to begin?

741
00:38:24,696 --> 00:38:25,905
I am your honor.

742
00:38:26,197 --> 00:38:28,575
I would like to court
to recognize and admit

743
00:38:28,867 --> 00:38:31,870
before this court assistant
prosecutor, JP Copeland,

744
00:38:32,162 --> 00:38:35,457
a Houston attorney, retained
by the widow and daughter

745
00:38:35,749 --> 00:38:37,084
of the murdered Galloway.

746
00:38:37,376 --> 00:38:40,505
Objection, your honor, on
the grounds that this Texas

747
00:38:40,797 --> 00:38:42,924
lawyer's not qualified
before the Louisiana bar,

748
00:38:43,216 --> 00:38:45,135
nor is he an elector of
the parish and state,

749
00:38:45,427 --> 00:38:47,787
and therefore, cannot serve as
a special prosecutor in state

750
00:38:47,971 --> 00:38:48,847
court in Louisiana.

751
00:38:49,139 --> 00:38:49,820
JUDGE: Overruled.

752
00:38:50,098 --> 00:38:51,180
Your honor, the defense...

753
00:38:51,434 --> 00:38:53,853
[inaudible], I said
I've already ruled

754
00:38:54,145 --> 00:38:56,313
on your objection,
and it's overruled.

755
00:38:56,605 --> 00:38:59,400
File a bill of exception.

756
00:38:59,692 --> 00:39:02,111
Mr. Copeland will be allowed to
serve as a special prosecutor

757
00:39:02,403 --> 00:39:04,573
during this trial.

758
00:39:04,865 --> 00:39:05,532
Bailiff?

759
00:39:05,824 --> 00:39:06,344
Swear him in.

760
00:39:08,785 --> 00:39:13,498
Your boys, they didn't
do such a bad job,

761
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:21,791
considering your case is
moving right along quick.

762
00:39:22,633 --> 00:39:24,761
Quick to the gallows.

763
00:39:25,052 --> 00:39:27,389
Now, you don't know that.

764
00:39:30,893 --> 00:39:32,102
I know plenty.

765
00:39:32,394 --> 00:39:34,235
Is the state ready to
call its first witness?

766
00:39:34,521 --> 00:39:37,816
My name is Fred Arnold, and
I'm a professional photographer.

767
00:39:38,108 --> 00:39:41,613
Did you take this picture and
develop it to the present state

768
00:39:41,905 --> 00:39:42,906
that it's in now?

769
00:39:43,198 --> 00:39:44,115
Yes sir.

770
00:39:44,407 --> 00:39:45,992
This is the photograph
that I took.

771
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:47,869
The state now
offers in evidence

772
00:39:48,161 --> 00:39:51,916
this photograph,
identified as exhibit A.

773
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:55,711
Ob objection to the reception
of the photograph in evidence,

774
00:39:56,003 --> 00:39:58,380
reason that it is unnecessary
to introduce in that its only

775
00:39:58,672 --> 00:40:00,966
effect would be to inflame
and prejudice the minds

776
00:40:01,258 --> 00:40:02,343
of the jurors.

777
00:40:02,635 --> 00:40:04,356
That if the state wishes
to establish death,

778
00:40:04,596 --> 00:40:06,723
the testimony of the
coroner should suffice.

779
00:40:07,015 --> 00:40:07,766
Overruled.

780
00:40:08,058 --> 00:40:09,338
The jury can see the photograph.

781
00:40:16,526 --> 00:40:17,406
No further question.

782
00:40:20,988 --> 00:40:22,615
My name is Dr. E. L. Clement.

783
00:40:22,907 --> 00:40:26,494
I've been the [inaudible] Parish
corner for the past 25 years.

784
00:40:26,786 --> 00:40:30,749
Did you examine the body and
determine the cause of death?

785
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:32,376
Yes.

786
00:40:32,668 --> 00:40:35,587
Mr. Joseph Galloway died
instantly from a gunshot wound

787
00:40:35,879 --> 00:40:38,882
to the head fired by
a <i>32</i> caliber pistol.

788
00:40:39,175 --> 00:40:40,927
Were there any other
wounds or injuries?

789
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:43,847
I object, uh, as to relevance.

790
00:40:44,138 --> 00:40:46,724
Any other wounds to the
body did not cause death.

791
00:40:47,016 --> 00:40:47,600
Overruled.

792
00:40:47,892 --> 00:40:48,852
Dr. Clement's an expert.

793
00:40:48,893 --> 00:40:50,353
I'll allow the question.

794
00:40:50,645 --> 00:40:53,649
There was a severe laceration
of the hand, clean to the bone.

795
00:40:53,941 --> 00:40:55,150
[gasps]

796
00:40:58,195 --> 00:40:59,196
Order in the courtroom.

797
00:41:02,032 --> 00:41:06,037
How did the defendant
appear at the inquest?

798
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:08,665
She was totally unresponsive.

799
00:41:08,957 --> 00:41:12,335
She offered no testimony,
like she didn't even care.

800
00:41:12,627 --> 00:41:13,211
Objection.

801
00:41:13,503 --> 00:41:14,713
Your honor, speculative.

802
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:18,259
I mean, how could he
possibly know how she felt?

803
00:41:18,551 --> 00:41:19,969
Sustained.

804
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:24,599
The jury will disregard the
last statement by this witness.

805
00:41:24,891 --> 00:41:25,433
Thank you.

806
00:41:25,725 --> 00:41:26,851
That's all Dr. Clement.

807
00:41:32,941 --> 00:41:34,526
Does the defense
have any questions?

808
00:41:44,203 --> 00:41:45,914
Dr. Clement?

809
00:41:46,205 --> 00:41:47,874
Other than a cut to
Mr. Calloway's hand,

810
00:41:48,166 --> 00:41:51,170
was there any other
evidence suggesting torture?

811
00:41:55,132 --> 00:41:55,841
No sir.

812
00:41:56,133 --> 00:41:58,052
[gasps]

813
00:41:58,344 --> 00:41:59,428
Quiet.

814
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,974
This is my courtroom,
and I'll have quiet.

815
00:42:03,266 --> 00:42:05,685
Thank you sir.

816
00:42:05,977 --> 00:42:07,062
No further questions.

817
00:42:09,856 --> 00:42:11,177
Dr. Clement, you may step down.

818
00:42:11,441 --> 00:42:13,109
Call your next witness.

819
00:42:13,401 --> 00:42:15,613
Sheriff Reid, When
was the first time

820
00:42:15,905 --> 00:42:19,158
you encountered the defendant?

821
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:20,952
We took custody of
her own Saturday,

822
00:42:21,243 --> 00:42:24,205
February the 17th from
Captain George McQuiston.

823
00:42:24,497 --> 00:42:25,873
And what happened next?

824
00:42:26,165 --> 00:42:28,460
Well, at that point, Trooper
Fremont Lebleiu and myself

825
00:42:28,752 --> 00:42:30,837
escorted her on a
search for the body.

826
00:42:31,129 --> 00:42:34,883
At first, I thought she
was blowing smoke up at us,

827
00:42:35,175 --> 00:42:38,178
but uh, she said she'd
take us to the body.

828
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:39,931
So we went looking.

829
00:42:40,223 --> 00:42:41,641
You sure there's
a body out here?

830
00:42:41,933 --> 00:42:45,687
I told you, we left his body
in one of these here fields.

831
00:42:45,979 --> 00:42:47,699
You think you'd be a
little more interested.

832
00:42:47,814 --> 00:42:50,108
Well, why don't you tell
me why on God's green earth

833
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,722
you'd come out
here to shoot a man

834
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,904
and leave him in here to rot?

835
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,781
We needed his car.

836
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,908
Who's we?

837
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,202
I'm no stool pigeon.

838
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,914
Even if he is a
little yellow rat.

839
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:04,749
That's all fine
and good Miss Henry,

840
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:07,043
but there's been no report
of a missing persons.

841
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:08,461
And you can run a good
dog where there ain't

842
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:09,953
no rabbits who'll run him out.

843
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:11,339
Now, I have about run out.

844
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:14,509
We're going to hitch this
wagon back to the house.

845
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:15,302
[gasp]

846
00:43:15,469 --> 00:43:15,989
This is it!

847
00:43:16,178 --> 00:43:16,678
That's it!

848
00:43:16,846 --> 00:43:17,972
Right there!

849
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:18,681
(MUTTERING) This woman
is nuttier than squirrel

850
00:43:18,973 --> 00:43:19,473
droppings.

851
00:43:27,482 --> 00:43:28,403
(WHISPERING) Told you.

852
00:43:33,864 --> 00:43:36,908
Lebleiu, we're going to need
the coroner out here, pronto.

853
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,787
Turn around, Miss Henry.

854
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,749
You're under the
arrest for murder.

855
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:46,169
Is this the gun you received
from Trooper Lebleiu, allegedly

856
00:43:46,461 --> 00:43:48,004
used by Mrs. Henry?

857
00:43:48,296 --> 00:43:49,589
That is the gun.

858
00:43:49,881 --> 00:43:52,593
And was the bullet retrieved
from the deceased, Mr.

859
00:43:52,885 --> 00:43:56,013
Galloway, fired from this gun?

860
00:43:56,305 --> 00:43:59,058
Ballistics report verified
that that was the gun used

861
00:43:59,349 --> 00:44:01,018
to kill JP Galloway.

862
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:03,897
Your honor, we entered
this as exhibit B,

863
00:44:04,189 --> 00:44:05,469
and we have no
further questions.

864
00:44:08,193 --> 00:44:11,696
JUDGE: The defense may
cross examine this witness.

865
00:44:11,988 --> 00:44:13,740
Sheriff Reid, did
you escort Mrs. Henry

866
00:44:14,032 --> 00:44:15,201
to the Beaumont Penitentiary?

867
00:44:15,493 --> 00:44:16,160
Yes, I did.

868
00:44:16,452 --> 00:44:17,703
CLEMENT: For what purpose?

869
00:44:17,995 --> 00:44:20,075
Well, We wanted to find
out who her accomplice was.

870
00:44:20,331 --> 00:44:22,666
That was the only way she was
going to cooperate with us.

871
00:44:22,958 --> 00:44:25,318
And isn't it true that on the
return trip to Lake Charles,

872
00:44:25,419 --> 00:44:27,547
Miss Henry made a
statement to you regarding

873
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:28,839
the death of JP Galloway?

874
00:44:29,007 --> 00:44:30,801
On the way back
from Beaumont, she

875
00:44:31,093 --> 00:44:33,011
said that she did
not fire the shot.

876
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:35,680
No further questions.

877
00:44:35,972 --> 00:44:37,766
Redirect, your honor.

878
00:44:38,058 --> 00:44:40,645
Sheriff Reid, was
this the first time

879
00:44:40,937 --> 00:44:43,356
that Mrs. Henry had
declared her innocence?

880
00:44:43,648 --> 00:44:45,408
That was the very first
she'd said on that.

881
00:44:50,571 --> 00:44:53,200
No further
questions your honor.

882
00:44:53,492 --> 00:44:56,161
Call your next witness.

883
00:44:56,453 --> 00:44:59,248
The state calls George
McQuiston to the stand.

884
00:45:02,794 --> 00:45:06,631
George McQuiston, will
you please take the stand?

885
00:45:06,923 --> 00:45:07,549
Sheriff Reid?

886
00:45:07,841 --> 00:45:09,259
Yes sir.

887
00:45:09,551 --> 00:45:12,011
Issue a bench warrant for the
arrest of George McQuiston.

888
00:45:12,303 --> 00:45:14,180
SHERIFF REID: Will
do your honor.

889
00:45:14,472 --> 00:45:16,767
JUDGE: Quiet.

890
00:45:17,059 --> 00:45:18,477
Call your next witness.

891
00:45:18,769 --> 00:45:20,980
PROSECUTOR: State your
name please for the court.

892
00:45:21,272 --> 00:45:23,482
Mrs. Emma Holt.

893
00:45:23,774 --> 00:45:26,820
PROSECUTOR: And what is your
relationship to the accused?

894
00:45:27,112 --> 00:45:30,365
I'm Annie B's...
uh, Toni Jo's aunt.

895
00:45:30,657 --> 00:45:32,617
I've always been known to
her as Auntie Beatrice.

896
00:45:32,909 --> 00:45:35,349
PROSECUTOR: Thank you Mrs. Holt,
but just answer the question.

897
00:45:37,914 --> 00:45:40,877
And when was the last
time you saw your niece

898
00:45:41,169 --> 00:45:43,963
before she showed up
unexpectedly at your home?

899
00:45:44,255 --> 00:45:45,840
I hadn't seen my
niece for four years

900
00:45:46,132 --> 00:45:48,176
until the night she
came to my house.

901
00:45:48,467 --> 00:45:50,636
I could see that she
was very nervous.

902
00:45:50,929 --> 00:45:52,639
And I could tell
something was wrong.

903
00:45:52,931 --> 00:45:54,766
I just wished George was there.

904
00:45:55,058 --> 00:45:58,979
PROSECUTOR: Please Mrs. Holt,
tell the court who George is.

905
00:45:59,271 --> 00:46:01,481
George McQuiston is
my brother, and he's

906
00:46:01,773 --> 00:46:03,651
captain of the state police.

907
00:46:03,943 --> 00:46:05,695
We're all very proud of him.

908
00:46:05,987 --> 00:46:07,747
He's nothing like Annie's
pa, the way he'd...

909
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:10,033
PROSECUTOR: Please Mrs. Holt.

910
00:46:10,325 --> 00:46:12,285
Just answer the question.

911
00:46:12,577 --> 00:46:13,870
I'm sorry.

912
00:46:14,162 --> 00:46:16,457
But you have to
understand, Annie B.

913
00:46:16,749 --> 00:46:20,127
Had to leave home when
she was only 1 <i>2</i> years old.

914
00:46:20,419 --> 00:46:22,630
I taught the baby how to sew.

915
00:46:22,922 --> 00:46:24,465
I was like her momma.

916
00:46:24,757 --> 00:46:27,052
PROSECUTOR: Your honor, I'd
like to request a recess

917
00:46:27,344 --> 00:46:28,945
but reserve the right
to further question

918
00:46:29,054 --> 00:46:30,889
this witness at a future time.

919
00:46:31,181 --> 00:46:32,098
Granted.

920
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:34,601
Witness must step down.

921
00:46:34,893 --> 00:46:37,979
Court will recess and resume
tomorrow morning at 9 AM.

922
00:46:38,271 --> 00:46:40,066
Got to get a
better [inaudible].

923
00:46:40,358 --> 00:46:41,984
Files are all over the place.

924
00:46:42,276 --> 00:46:45,571
Did you and do you have
a close relationship...

925
00:46:56,208 --> 00:46:59,086
I'd like to recall Mrs.
Emma Holt to the stand.

926
00:46:59,378 --> 00:47:01,964
You were telling us yesterday
that you had not heard

927
00:47:02,256 --> 00:47:05,635
from Mrs. Henry in four years?

928
00:47:05,927 --> 00:47:08,179
Yes sir.

929
00:47:08,471 --> 00:47:11,557
And what happened when
she did contact you?

930
00:47:11,849 --> 00:47:14,102
Well, it was the
middle of the night.

931
00:47:14,394 --> 00:47:15,646
Tell me dear, what's wrong?

932
00:47:15,938 --> 00:47:18,983
I've gone and done
something terrible Aunt Emma.

933
00:47:19,275 --> 00:47:20,567
Lord have mercy child.

934
00:47:20,859 --> 00:47:22,569
What has that no good husband
of yours gone and done?

935
00:47:22,861 --> 00:47:24,238
Is it cowboy you call him?

936
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:25,451
You don't understand.

937
00:47:29,411 --> 00:47:34,207
I shot a man in the heart.

938
00:47:37,794 --> 00:47:39,046
[gasps]

939
00:47:39,338 --> 00:47:40,381
[sobbing]

940
00:47:40,715 --> 00:47:41,215
Oh.

941
00:47:46,178 --> 00:47:47,305
Oh child, no.

942
00:47:54,396 --> 00:47:56,648
[crying]

943
00:47:57,983 --> 00:48:00,444
I'll give your
Uncle George a call.

944
00:48:00,736 --> 00:48:01,616
He'll know what to do.

945
00:48:06,909 --> 00:48:09,078
Shh.

946
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:13,207
And she told you, I shot a man?

947
00:48:13,499 --> 00:48:14,710
Yes.

948
00:48:15,002 --> 00:48:17,421
But I'm not sure if that's
what she meant to say.

949
00:48:17,713 --> 00:48:19,131
She was in a state of shock.

950
00:48:19,423 --> 00:48:23,886
Mrs. Holt, is this the gun
that Tony Jo Henry showed you?

951
00:48:24,178 --> 00:48:25,346
It could be.

952
00:48:25,637 --> 00:48:27,432
I don't know guns that much.

953
00:48:27,724 --> 00:48:30,643
Is this the gun you gave
to the police officers?

954
00:48:30,935 --> 00:48:31,728
Objection.

955
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,300
The witness said
she wasn't sure.

956
00:48:33,313 --> 00:48:34,522
Overruled.

957
00:48:34,814 --> 00:48:36,107
The weapon's already been
established as the gun

958
00:48:36,399 --> 00:48:39,487
the police confiscated
from the old home.

959
00:48:39,779 --> 00:48:41,781
You then called your
brother, George McQuiston?

960
00:48:42,073 --> 00:48:43,074
Yes.

961
00:48:43,366 --> 00:48:44,408
PROSECUTOR: And what
did you tell him?

962
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:45,826
I told him to come
as soon as he could,

963
00:48:46,118 --> 00:48:47,536
that Annie B. Was in trouble.

964
00:48:47,828 --> 00:48:49,163
PROSECUTOR: And
your brother came?

965
00:48:49,455 --> 00:48:53,502
He came with two
policemen to get Annie B.

966
00:48:53,794 --> 00:49:00,384
Mrs. Holt, do you know
where your brother is?

967
00:49:00,675 --> 00:49:01,426
No sir.

968
00:49:07,225 --> 00:49:09,352
No further questions.

969
00:49:09,644 --> 00:49:11,324
JUDGE: Does the defense
have any questions?

970
00:49:11,437 --> 00:49:12,157
Yes, your honor.

971
00:49:15,859 --> 00:49:17,736
[clears throat]

972
00:49:21,323 --> 00:49:25,327
Mrs. Holt... did you and do
you have a close relationship

973
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:27,497
with your niece?

974
00:49:27,789 --> 00:49:29,040
Yes.

975
00:49:29,332 --> 00:49:31,376
I raised her a spell.

976
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:32,989
And what was her
childhood like?

977
00:49:33,169 --> 00:49:34,629
Objection.

978
00:49:34,921 --> 00:49:36,961
I fail to see the relevance
of this case your honor.

979
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:41,095
Your honor, We will
show you the relevance

980
00:49:41,387 --> 00:49:45,224
by demonstrating the conditions
of Miss Henry's childhood.

981
00:49:45,516 --> 00:49:46,356
Allowed, overruled.

982
00:49:50,564 --> 00:49:56,153
How old was Annie B... also
known as Toni Jo Henry...

983
00:49:56,445 --> 00:49:57,685
when she came to live with you?

984
00:49:57,737 --> 00:49:59,406
AUNT EMMA: She was almost 12.

985
00:49:59,698 --> 00:50:02,409
CLEMENT: And where was this
11-year-old girl's momma?

986
00:50:02,702 --> 00:50:06,456
Her momma passed on to the
good Lord when she was 10.

987
00:50:06,747 --> 00:50:08,749
TB ate her up.

988
00:50:09,041 --> 00:50:11,461
My brother and his
pa, he made her

989
00:50:11,752 --> 00:50:14,798
get a job at the macaroni
factory in Treeport.

990
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:19,052
So she was forced
to leave school.

991
00:50:19,344 --> 00:50:22,806
And how long was she at
the macaroni factory?

992
00:50:23,098 --> 00:50:25,809
'Til right before she
came to stay with me.

993
00:50:26,101 --> 00:50:27,703
The factory fired her
when they found out

994
00:50:27,812 --> 00:50:30,231
about her momma dying
at the TB and all.

995
00:50:30,523 --> 00:50:35,820
Mrs. Holt... was Tony
Jo's father kind to her?

996
00:50:36,112 --> 00:50:37,447
No.

997
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:40,784
He let that no good whiskey
turn him into a mean man.

998
00:50:41,076 --> 00:50:42,912
He didn't used to be so mean.

999
00:50:43,204 --> 00:50:48,751
Mrs. Holt... did Toni
Jo's father, your brother,

1000
00:50:49,043 --> 00:50:50,336
ever hit her?

1001
00:50:53,131 --> 00:50:55,091
Poor little thing.

1002
00:50:55,383 --> 00:50:57,010
She always had
bruises on her body.

1003
00:50:57,302 --> 00:50:58,220
Objection.

1004
00:50:58,512 --> 00:51:00,555
Cause for speculation,
your honor.

1005
00:51:00,847 --> 00:51:04,435
Children do fall down
and they get bruises.

1006
00:51:04,727 --> 00:51:05,853
JUDGE: Sustained.

1007
00:51:06,145 --> 00:51:08,814
Mrs. Holt, you
testified earlier

1008
00:51:09,106 --> 00:51:12,693
that you told Toni Jo
that you would help her

1009
00:51:12,985 --> 00:51:14,404
if she told you what happened.

1010
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:15,948
Is that correct?

1011
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,616
Yes.

1012
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,409
I wanted to help you baby.

1013
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:22,538
Please address your comments
to the court Mrs. Holt.

1014
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:25,874
Did Toni Jo confess to
you after you told her

1015
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:27,669
you'd help her?

1016
00:51:27,961 --> 00:51:29,712
I think so.

1017
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:32,131
She just looked so hopeless.

1018
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:35,552
So lost.

1019
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:41,559
Mrs. Holt, you stated earlier
that your niece, Toni Jo Henry,

1020
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:45,354
told you she shot
a man in the heart.

1021
00:51:45,646 --> 00:51:48,023
Is that correct?

1022
00:51:48,315 --> 00:51:49,858
Yes.

1023
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:53,405
You're sure she
said, in the heart?

1024
00:51:53,697 --> 00:51:55,782
Not the head?

1025
00:51:56,074 --> 00:51:56,658
Yes sir.

1026
00:52:00,161 --> 00:52:01,288
That's all then.

1027
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:04,792
Thank you for your testimony.

1028
00:52:05,084 --> 00:52:07,211
JUDGE: You may step
down Miss Holt.

1029
00:52:07,503 --> 00:52:09,589
Prosecution rests your honor.

1030
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,675
The defense may call
its first witness.

1031
00:52:12,967 --> 00:52:15,209
BAILIFF: Do you swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

1032
00:52:15,345 --> 00:52:17,723
and nothing but the
truth, so help you god?

1033
00:52:18,015 --> 00:52:18,682
I do.

1034
00:52:18,974 --> 00:52:20,014
BAILIFF: Please be seated.

1035
00:52:27,817 --> 00:52:30,028
Who's your husband?

1036
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,321
Claude D. Henry.

1037
00:52:31,613 --> 00:52:34,198
You and your husband devoted?

1038
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:35,658
Yes sir.

1039
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:37,230
CLEMENT: He been in any trouble?

1040
00:52:40,331 --> 00:52:41,957
Yes sir.

1041
00:52:42,249 --> 00:52:45,127
And what was his trouble?

1042
00:52:45,419 --> 00:52:46,587
TONI: Murder.

1043
00:52:46,879 --> 00:52:48,756
Was he charged with
killing someone?

1044
00:52:49,048 --> 00:52:50,007
TONI: Yes sir.

1045
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,092
CLEMENT: Was he
convicted of this crime?

1046
00:52:51,384 --> 00:52:53,094
TONI: Yes sir.

1047
00:52:53,386 --> 00:52:56,598
Where'd you meet Mr. Galloway?

1048
00:52:56,890 --> 00:53:02,103
About one or 1/2 mile
this side of Orange, Texas.

1049
00:53:02,396 --> 00:53:04,440
Did you and Finnon
Burkes both have guns?

1050
00:53:04,732 --> 00:53:05,691
Yes sir.

1051
00:53:05,983 --> 00:53:08,277
Were both the guns loaded?

1052
00:53:08,569 --> 00:53:10,363
No sir, only one.

1053
00:53:10,655 --> 00:53:13,324
Well, who had that gun?

1054
00:53:13,616 --> 00:53:14,951
Finnon Burkes.

1055
00:53:15,243 --> 00:53:19,956
So Burkes had the
only loaded gun?

1056
00:53:20,248 --> 00:53:20,999
Yes sir.

1057
00:53:23,502 --> 00:53:24,294
Come on.

1058
00:53:24,586 --> 00:53:25,707
Tell the jury what happened.

1059
00:53:31,678 --> 00:53:36,516
After We got in the car,
Arkie pulled out his gun

1060
00:53:36,808 --> 00:53:38,686
and told him to stop the car.

1061
00:53:44,233 --> 00:53:47,403
Go on.

1062
00:53:47,695 --> 00:53:51,741
Well, Arkie said that he'd
better get in the turtle back.

1063
00:53:52,033 --> 00:53:54,452
And he slammed that
hood down so hard.

1064
00:53:54,744 --> 00:53:57,956
Well, it cut up that
fellow's hand real bad.

1065
00:53:58,248 --> 00:53:59,457
CLEMENT: Who drove?

1066
00:53:59,749 --> 00:54:01,209
Arkie.

1067
00:54:01,501 --> 00:54:04,338
I never learned how to drive.

1068
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:06,716
So Burkes drove the car?

1069
00:54:07,007 --> 00:54:09,719
TONI: Yes sir.

1070
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:11,679
Go on.

1071
00:54:11,971 --> 00:54:14,975
Well, Arkie drove
for awhile and stopped

1072
00:54:15,267 --> 00:54:17,477
by the side of a dirt road
on account of all the noise

1073
00:54:17,769 --> 00:54:19,521
that Callaway was making.

1074
00:54:19,813 --> 00:54:22,899
He uh, made him get
out of the turtle back

1075
00:54:23,191 --> 00:54:26,362
and take his clothes off.

1076
00:54:26,654 --> 00:54:29,449
There was some conversation.

1077
00:54:29,741 --> 00:54:33,327
I, I don't remember
what it was about.

1078
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:35,538
I picked up the clothes,
and Mr. Galloway

1079
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:39,418
went behind the haystack
and kneeled down.

1080
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:42,254
He said, don't you
know you're going to go

1081
00:54:42,546 --> 00:54:44,923
to the penitentiary for this?

1082
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:47,255
And I told him, he'd better
think where he would go.

1083
00:54:51,931 --> 00:54:53,600
And I started back
towards the car.

1084
00:54:57,729 --> 00:54:58,521
[gun shot]

1085
00:54:58,813 --> 00:55:00,106
[gasp]

1086
00:55:02,234 --> 00:55:03,986
(WHISPERING) What'd you do?

1087
00:55:04,278 --> 00:55:05,318
I shot him in the heart.

1088
00:55:07,782 --> 00:55:08,583
Through the heart?

1089
00:55:08,699 --> 00:55:09,450
Yeah.

1090
00:55:09,742 --> 00:55:10,942
Sounded like a punctured tire.

1091
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,681
What happened after
you left the rice field?

1092
00:55:26,677 --> 00:55:32,934
First, we stopped down the
road and burned his clothes.

1093
00:55:33,226 --> 00:55:35,269
And then Arkie drove us to
a little town in Arkansas

1094
00:55:35,561 --> 00:55:36,841
where we was going
to rob a bank.

1095
00:55:37,104 --> 00:55:37,785
CLEMENT: Did you?

1096
00:55:41,026 --> 00:55:41,860
No.

1097
00:55:42,152 --> 00:55:43,392
CLEMENT: You didn't rob a bank?

1098
00:55:47,783 --> 00:55:50,077
There was no bank.

1099
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:52,539
I thought you said that
there was a bank in this here

1100
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,912
town that we could hold up.

1101
00:55:53,957 --> 00:55:54,958
There used to be.

1102
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:57,043
How was I supposed
to know it dried up?

1103
00:55:57,335 --> 00:55:58,735
Well, now what
are we going to do?

1104
00:55:58,962 --> 00:56:01,548
Find another one.

1105
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,051
Well, it better be soon!

1106
00:56:04,343 --> 00:56:06,011
We hardly have any money left.

1107
00:56:06,303 --> 00:56:07,513
ARKIE: Yeah?

1108
00:56:07,805 --> 00:56:08,514
Well, get me something
to drink with that money.

1109
00:56:08,806 --> 00:56:10,057
Not not Arkie.

1110
00:56:10,349 --> 00:56:11,934
We've got to keep
our wits about us.

1111
00:56:12,226 --> 00:56:13,269
ARKIE: Ha.

1112
00:56:13,561 --> 00:56:15,202
After a day like today,
Toni, [inaudible].

1113
00:56:17,816 --> 00:56:21,611
Well, you got his watch.

1114
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:26,784
Why don't you use that?

1115
00:56:27,076 --> 00:56:28,327
ARKIE: Don't give me no lip.

1116
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:31,789
You'd better not make me
look for it sweetheart.

1117
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:35,292
Oh.

1118
00:56:40,632 --> 00:56:42,392
Well, I used the money
to buy a bus to ticket

1119
00:56:42,593 --> 00:56:43,844
back to Shreveport.

1120
00:56:44,136 --> 00:56:46,221
And I Walked to Aunt
Emma's from there.

1121
00:56:46,513 --> 00:56:48,807
Would your Aunt Emma
testify about your childhood?

1122
00:56:49,099 --> 00:56:51,477
Could you describe what it was
like growing up in your home?

1123
00:56:51,769 --> 00:56:52,769
Objection, irrelevance.

1124
00:56:53,021 --> 00:56:55,023
The facts of Mrs.
Henry's past have

1125
00:56:55,315 --> 00:56:56,524
been presented to this court.

1126
00:56:56,816 --> 00:56:58,985
And nothing new can come
from this testimony other

1127
00:56:59,277 --> 00:57:00,820
than to elicit
sympathy from the jury.

1128
00:57:01,112 --> 00:57:04,074
Your honor, we believe
the firsthand account

1129
00:57:04,366 --> 00:57:06,577
bears listening to,
because the defendant was

1130
00:57:06,869 --> 00:57:10,080
a child of misfortune and
a victim of circumstances.

1131
00:57:10,372 --> 00:57:12,833
I can see no additional
relevant information coming

1132
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:15,045
from this line of questioning.

1133
00:57:15,337 --> 00:57:16,138
Objection sustained.

1134
00:57:16,379 --> 00:57:17,130
Your honor...

1135
00:57:17,422 --> 00:57:19,299
Don't try my patience Mr. Moss.

1136
00:57:19,591 --> 00:57:21,760
The objection is sustained.

1137
00:57:22,052 --> 00:57:23,887
Now, move on.

1138
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:25,100
No further questions.

1139
00:57:36,192 --> 00:57:38,034
You changed your story
about who shot the man

1140
00:57:38,195 --> 00:57:40,322
after you saw your husband.

1141
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:41,990
Yes.

1142
00:57:44,826 --> 00:57:46,912
Mrs. Henry, you say you're
devoted to your husband,

1143
00:57:47,204 --> 00:57:48,644
because he cured
you of a drug habit.

1144
00:57:52,877 --> 00:57:54,087
Yes.

1145
00:57:54,379 --> 00:57:56,297
Then you're no
longer an addict?

1146
00:57:59,425 --> 00:58:02,221
No.

1147
00:58:02,513 --> 00:58:04,640
Well, that's
wonderful Mrs. Henry.

1148
00:58:04,932 --> 00:58:05,572
Congratulations.

1149
00:58:08,811 --> 00:58:09,691
That's all your honor.

1150
00:58:13,065 --> 00:58:14,401
You may step down Mrs. Henry.

1151
00:58:34,588 --> 00:58:36,632
Does the defense have
any more questions?

1152
00:58:36,924 --> 00:58:37,564
No your honor.

1153
00:58:37,758 --> 00:58:38,885
The defense rests.

1154
00:58:39,177 --> 00:58:41,013
The court is recessed
into 9 AM tomorrow

1155
00:58:41,304 --> 00:58:45,976
morning, when We will
begin closing arguments.

1156
00:58:46,268 --> 00:58:53,026
This glass of water represents
the lives of two women.

1157
00:58:53,317 --> 00:58:55,194
Their lives were as
clean as this water.

1158
00:59:06,373 --> 00:59:11,045
This ink is the
slayer's bullet which

1159
00:59:11,336 --> 00:59:15,425
brought gloom and
heartbreak to the very souls

1160
00:59:15,717 --> 00:59:16,968
in this widow and her daughter.

1161
00:59:20,555 --> 00:59:22,849
You have a responsibility
to the state of Louisiana

1162
00:59:23,141 --> 00:59:24,851
to protect it from
people like Mrs. Henry.

1163
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:29,491
Do the right thing.

1164
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:42,154
Death is the only verdict
and just punishment.

1165
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,500
GENTLEMAN: Hang her.

1166
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:47,959
COURTROOM OBSERVER: Yes.

1167
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,127
JUDGE: That's enough.

1168
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,781
I'll have the next
person arrested.

1169
00:59:54,342 --> 00:59:57,095
It is our belief based
on the evidence presented

1170
00:59:57,386 --> 00:59:59,026
that our client should
not be found guilty

1171
00:59:59,222 --> 01:00:02,643
as charged, which in this case,
means sentencing her to death.

1172
01:00:02,935 --> 01:00:07,272
The direct testimony of who
shot Mr. Galloway establishes it

1173
01:00:07,564 --> 01:00:11,276
was not Mrs. Henry who pulled
the trigger, but Finnon Burkes.

1174
01:00:11,568 --> 01:00:13,288
It was Burkes who secured
the murder weapon,

1175
01:00:13,487 --> 01:00:15,532
and it was Burkes who
drove the stolen car.

1176
01:00:15,824 --> 01:00:18,493
There is no proof beyond
a reasonable doubt

1177
01:00:18,785 --> 01:00:22,205
that Mrs. Henry actually
shot JP Calloway... only

1178
01:00:22,497 --> 01:00:25,166
circumstantial evidence.

1179
01:00:25,458 --> 01:00:28,712
Gentlemen at the jury, you
cannot sentence a woman to hang

1180
01:00:29,004 --> 01:00:31,590
by the neck until dead based
on circumstantial evidence.

1181
01:00:40,433 --> 01:00:42,394
Now, in a few minutes,
the judge will issue you

1182
01:00:42,686 --> 01:00:46,148
possible verdicts in this case.

1183
01:00:46,439 --> 01:00:49,192
We respectfully,
respectfully ask

1184
01:00:49,484 --> 01:00:52,947
that you return a verdict
other than guilty as charged

1185
01:00:53,239 --> 01:00:55,449
and spare the life
of Toni Jo Henry.

1186
01:00:59,453 --> 01:01:00,746
Well, that's it.

1187
01:01:11,967 --> 01:01:14,387
Gentlemen of the
jury, we've given you

1188
01:01:14,679 --> 01:01:17,932
the necessary elements to
prove the crime of murder.

1189
01:01:18,224 --> 01:01:21,144
Further, gentlemen, if you find
that from the evidence provided

1190
01:01:21,436 --> 01:01:24,230
in this case that this
defendant conspired with another

1191
01:01:24,522 --> 01:01:28,736
or others to commit a felony,
and that during the course

1192
01:01:29,028 --> 01:01:31,280
of that conspiracy, one
of the conspirators,

1193
01:01:31,572 --> 01:01:35,492
not the defendant,
actually pulled the trigger

1194
01:01:35,784 --> 01:01:40,373
that shot JP Galloway,
then the defendant

1195
01:01:40,665 --> 01:01:42,425
is just as guilty under
the law as though she

1196
01:01:42,667 --> 01:01:44,461
had pulled the trigger herself.

1197
01:01:44,753 --> 01:01:47,881
Court will be in recess
while the jury deliberates.

1198
01:02:08,278 --> 01:02:09,905
JUDGE: Will the
defendant please rise?

1199
01:02:16,955 --> 01:02:18,195
Has the jury reached a verdict?

1200
01:02:20,959 --> 01:02:22,961
We have your honor.

1201
01:02:23,253 --> 01:02:26,966
We find the defendant
guilty as charged.

1202
01:02:27,258 --> 01:02:28,008
[gasps]

1203
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:29,885
JUDGE: Quiet in the courtroom.

1204
01:02:30,177 --> 01:02:34,056
Bailiff, please reman Mrs.
Henry back to her cell.

1205
01:02:34,348 --> 01:02:38,478
TONI: She was the only
witness, some... someone who

1206
01:02:38,770 --> 01:02:41,147
unsuccessfully sought to
have her tell something

1207
01:02:41,439 --> 01:02:46,403
of her past life as
an abused young girl

1208
01:02:46,695 --> 01:02:50,533
and as a prostitute
and a drug addict

1209
01:02:50,825 --> 01:02:55,162
as influencing factors in
the crime of which she stood

1210
01:02:55,454 --> 01:02:58,082
accused.

1211
01:02:58,374 --> 01:03:00,751
Seems real fair, don't it?

1212
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:03,338
But you boys are
asking for an appeal.

1213
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:04,423
And that's good.

1214
01:03:39,377 --> 01:03:41,046
She actually ask for me?

1215
01:03:41,338 --> 01:03:45,008
She asked to speak to a priest?

1216
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:48,762
Well, not in so many words.

1217
01:03:49,054 --> 01:03:50,056
What words did she use?

1218
01:03:54,268 --> 01:03:57,897
I don't force myself
or my face on anyone.

1219
01:03:58,189 --> 01:03:59,857
But that's why you're
the perfect person

1220
01:04:00,149 --> 01:04:01,109
to talk with her father.

1221
01:04:04,029 --> 01:04:05,739
Father Richard.

1222
01:04:06,031 --> 01:04:07,783
I don't know what to say to her.

1223
01:04:13,497 --> 01:04:14,498
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1224
01:04:14,582 --> 01:04:16,042
Listen to this.

1225
01:04:16,334 --> 01:04:19,170
Mr Copland's participation in
the trial cannot be said to be

1226
01:04:19,462 --> 01:04:23,758
favorable to the prosecution
as he stated before the trial

1227
01:04:24,050 --> 01:04:28,222
in the public press that he was
employed by the deceased family

1228
01:04:28,514 --> 01:04:30,849
to demand only a
capital verdict.

1229
01:04:31,141 --> 01:04:32,502
And a high court
senior shouldn't

1230
01:04:32,684 --> 01:04:34,061
have been allowed to testify
about your childhood.

1231
01:04:34,353 --> 01:04:35,813
Yeah.

1232
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:36,980
And they didn't like the fact
that your so-called confessions

1233
01:04:37,272 --> 01:04:39,192
weren't free and voluntary.

1234
01:04:39,484 --> 01:04:41,694
It helped your uncle
wasn't to be found.

1235
01:04:41,986 --> 01:04:43,787
Moss told me that the
authorities are trying

1236
01:04:43,863 --> 01:04:46,032
to get him to turn himself in.

1237
01:04:46,324 --> 01:04:47,200
That can help me.

1238
01:04:47,492 --> 01:04:48,243
Yeah.

1239
01:04:48,535 --> 01:04:49,244
Well, maybe at the next trial.

1240
01:04:49,536 --> 01:04:50,287
But we'll be ready for him.

1241
01:04:50,579 --> 01:04:51,079
Wait.

1242
01:04:56,001 --> 01:04:58,212
(WHISPERING) Thank you so
much for coming [inaudible].

1243
01:05:02,134 --> 01:05:06,179
Toni Jo, this is the priest
I've been telling you about.

1244
01:05:06,471 --> 01:05:08,140
This is Father Richard.

1245
01:05:08,432 --> 01:05:10,934
Well, it's nice to
meet you Father Richard.

1246
01:05:11,226 --> 01:05:14,355
I never really talked
to a priest before.

1247
01:05:14,647 --> 01:05:18,192
Well then, I hope I
don't disappoint you.

1248
01:05:18,484 --> 01:05:21,696
I'd offer you a place to sit,
but uh, we'd kind of full here.

1249
01:05:21,988 --> 01:05:26,243
No, we've got to be on
our way, so take ours.

1250
01:05:26,535 --> 01:05:29,204
Nice to meet you
Father Richard.

1251
01:05:29,496 --> 01:05:30,177
I'm Clement Moss.

1252
01:05:30,456 --> 01:05:31,373
Clement.

1253
01:05:31,665 --> 01:05:33,065
This is my partner,
Norman Anderson.

1254
01:05:33,125 --> 01:05:34,251
Norman.

1255
01:05:34,543 --> 01:05:36,423
Well, I didn't intend
to scare you fellas off.

1256
01:05:36,545 --> 01:05:37,545
Oh, don't worry Father.

1257
01:05:37,546 --> 01:05:38,214
They don't scare that easy.

1258
01:05:38,506 --> 01:05:39,632
I gotta get home.

1259
01:05:39,924 --> 01:05:41,092
Really looking forward
to finally having a home

1260
01:05:41,384 --> 01:05:42,302
cooked meal.

1261
01:05:42,594 --> 01:05:43,395
Have a nice visit.

1262
01:05:43,553 --> 01:05:44,762
Have a nice visit.

1263
01:05:45,054 --> 01:05:46,294
Bring me back some leftovers.

1264
01:05:46,514 --> 01:05:48,516
Food stinks around here.

1265
01:05:48,808 --> 01:05:50,102
[laughs]

1266
01:06:29,853 --> 01:06:31,813
Well, I guess you're waiting
to hear my sob story.

1267
01:06:35,275 --> 01:06:37,361
I never really been
that big on confession.

1268
01:06:40,031 --> 01:06:48,031
Truthfully, neither have I.

1269
01:06:48,873 --> 01:06:51,877
You ain't a typical
priest, are you?

1270
01:06:52,169 --> 01:06:55,798
Typical has never
been a goal of mine.

1271
01:06:56,090 --> 01:06:56,966
Good.

1272
01:06:57,258 --> 01:06:57,967
Because I don't
really go for them

1273
01:06:58,259 --> 01:06:59,340
firing brimstone preachers.

1274
01:07:06,768 --> 01:07:09,187
Thank you.

1275
01:07:09,479 --> 01:07:10,272
To quench the fire?

1276
01:07:19,198 --> 01:07:21,075
I would just like
to be your friend.

1277
01:07:23,744 --> 01:07:26,290
But I'm a criminal.

1278
01:07:26,582 --> 01:07:30,043
Some people thought
Jesus was a criminal too.

1279
01:07:30,961 --> 01:07:31,461
Right.

1280
01:07:35,757 --> 01:07:37,802
Just don't try any of that
converting stuff on me.

1281
01:07:38,094 --> 01:07:43,182
I had enough religion
to last me a lifetime,

1282
01:07:43,474 --> 01:07:45,018
no matter how short it may be.

1283
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,823
How can you befriend
a woman like that?

1284
01:07:58,115 --> 01:08:00,326
She murdered a
man in cold blood.

1285
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:02,954
Well, you must know more
than the courts then.

1286
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:06,082
Because they're in the process
of trying to figure that out.

1287
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:08,335
What I do know is that
cold hearted woman needs

1288
01:08:08,627 --> 01:08:10,086
to pay for what she's done.

1289
01:08:10,378 --> 01:08:11,699
You are not
describing the woman

1290
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:13,924
I have come to know
these past few months.

1291
01:08:14,216 --> 01:08:15,509
You expect me to swallow that?

1292
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:16,510
No.

1293
01:08:22,183 --> 01:08:25,311
If I can arrange it, would
you like the opportunity

1294
01:08:25,604 --> 01:08:30,859
to speak with that cold
hearted woman face to face?

1295
01:08:31,151 --> 01:08:31,651
You bet.

1296
01:08:31,818 --> 01:08:34,112
Wait here.

1297
01:08:34,404 --> 01:08:37,240
I've never met a person
accused of murder.

1298
01:08:37,533 --> 01:08:41,162
So while I've covered the
trial of Annie Beatrice Henry,

1299
01:08:41,454 --> 01:08:45,917
since the beginning, I was
reluctant to actually meet

1300
01:08:46,209 --> 01:08:49,003
her face to face.

1301
01:08:49,295 --> 01:08:50,756
Yellow bellied is more like it.

1302
01:08:51,048 --> 01:08:54,426
You know, I smiled
at that fellow twice.

1303
01:08:54,718 --> 01:08:57,805
I'd say a lot of
talent's gone to waste.

1304
01:08:58,097 --> 01:08:59,857
He couldn't believe
your cell was unlocked.

1305
01:08:59,932 --> 01:09:02,977
He was shaking in his boots.

1306
01:09:03,269 --> 01:09:06,189
Toni Jo, as she
refers to herself,

1307
01:09:06,481 --> 01:09:08,942
has been in jail for six months.

1308
01:09:09,234 --> 01:09:12,070
She's currently awaiting
her second trial.

1309
01:09:12,362 --> 01:09:16,367
I found her to be very pleasant,
unlike her image thus far.

1310
01:09:16,659 --> 01:09:19,912
She maintains her innocence
and firing the bullet,

1311
01:09:20,204 --> 01:09:23,791
but she does take responsibility
for her part in the crime.

1312
01:09:24,083 --> 01:09:27,254
Mrs. Henry claims she's not
unlike any other woman in love

1313
01:09:27,546 --> 01:09:30,215
with her husband,
and that's what drove

1314
01:09:30,507 --> 01:09:32,092
her to make some bad decisions.

1315
01:09:32,384 --> 01:09:35,679
Toni Jo joked about her
need for a sewing machine

1316
01:09:35,971 --> 01:09:39,267
to make some new clothes when
I commented on her appearance

1317
01:09:39,559 --> 01:09:41,853
and how much coverage
it's getting.

1318
01:09:42,145 --> 01:09:44,397
It's difficult for
this reluctant reporter

1319
01:09:44,689 --> 01:09:48,151
to believe that this
woman deserves to die.

1320
01:09:48,443 --> 01:09:50,279
Punishment, yes.

1321
01:09:50,571 --> 01:09:51,947
Death, no.

1322
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:58,412
Coral, I've got an idea.

1323
01:09:58,704 --> 01:10:01,499
Does that old sewing machine
downstairs still work?

1324
01:10:01,791 --> 01:10:02,472
Oh, no, no, no.

1325
01:10:02,667 --> 01:10:05,295
Over there.

1326
01:10:05,587 --> 01:10:06,921
Be careful with that.

1327
01:10:07,213 --> 01:10:08,256
Holy smoke.

1328
01:10:08,548 --> 01:10:09,674
It's a good thing we
had that other cell

1329
01:10:09,966 --> 01:10:12,719
to put all this stuff in, huh?

1330
01:10:13,011 --> 01:10:13,679
[gasps]

1331
01:10:13,971 --> 01:10:16,682
(WHISPERING) [inaudible].

1332
01:10:16,974 --> 01:10:18,100
[laughs]

1333
01:10:18,392 --> 01:10:20,352
It's about time them
press buzzards started

1334
01:10:20,644 --> 01:10:23,105
turning around public opinion.

1335
01:10:23,397 --> 01:10:24,148
One Gibbs.

1336
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:25,859
Let's not get carried away.

1337
01:10:26,151 --> 01:10:28,069
How are they just one?

1338
01:10:28,361 --> 01:10:32,783
She says it's for... she said
it's for you to buy material

1339
01:10:33,074 --> 01:10:34,701
to sew some new clothes.

1340
01:10:34,993 --> 01:10:36,328
I'd like to write you.

1341
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:39,207
And in my next
letter, I will include

1342
01:10:39,499 --> 01:10:43,252
funds for your legal expenses.

1343
01:10:43,544 --> 01:10:45,046
How much does that make?

1344
01:10:45,338 --> 01:10:46,964
Well, all told, I
ain't exactly sure.

1345
01:10:47,256 --> 01:10:48,549
But this Week,
it's at least $40.

1346
01:10:51,553 --> 01:10:52,354
No skimming Gibbs.

1347
01:10:58,894 --> 01:11:01,815
[MUSIC BILLIE HOLIDAY,
"SOLITUDE"]

1348
01:11:53,912 --> 01:11:55,247
[gasp]

1349
01:12:00,335 --> 01:12:01,754
You're not wearing
that in court.

1350
01:12:02,046 --> 01:12:03,047
Oh boy.

1351
01:12:03,339 --> 01:12:05,842
Wait 'til my papa
gets a load of this.

1352
01:12:06,134 --> 01:12:09,721
Or better yet, Wait 'til Mr.
Copeland lays his eyes on me.

1353
01:12:10,013 --> 01:12:13,225
I need a full length
mirror in here.

1354
01:12:13,517 --> 01:12:15,060
Copeland can't try
this case again,

1355
01:12:15,352 --> 01:12:18,647
but the district attorney,
Patterson, remains the same.

1356
01:12:18,939 --> 01:12:20,900
Oh, and no new judge.

1357
01:12:21,191 --> 01:12:22,151
We'll face Hood again.

1358
01:12:22,443 --> 01:12:25,739
You boys are just
full of good news.

1359
01:12:26,031 --> 01:12:27,532
Mm, mm, mm.

1360
01:12:27,824 --> 01:12:29,584
Any which way you shoot
yourself in the foot,

1361
01:12:29,701 --> 01:12:30,502
you wear that thing.

1362
01:12:30,577 --> 01:12:31,661
Yeah.

1363
01:12:31,953 --> 01:12:32,537
And you wear that thing
in court, the press

1364
01:12:32,829 --> 01:12:33,709
will have a field day.

1365
01:12:33,747 --> 01:12:34,581
Oh, let them.

1366
01:12:34,873 --> 01:12:36,708
What's the difference?

1367
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,544
Be smart Toni Jo.

1368
01:12:38,836 --> 01:12:39,957
Because Patterson's smart.

1369
01:12:40,004 --> 01:12:40,880
Yeah.

the right to have.

1371
01:12:42,173 --> 01:12:43,382
Finnon Burkes as a witness.

1372
01:12:43,674 --> 01:12:44,675
And Judge Hood is not
allowed to our objections

1373
01:12:44,967 --> 01:12:46,677
to Burkes's testimony.

1374
01:12:46,969 --> 01:12:49,180
Well, like I said,
what's the difference?

1375
01:12:51,975 --> 01:12:54,811
Get a load of this.

1376
01:12:55,103 --> 01:12:55,784
It's from Burkes.

1377
01:12:58,899 --> 01:13:01,235
Basically, he's offered to
take full blame for the murder

1378
01:13:01,527 --> 01:13:03,613
if Toni Jo will help
him escape from jail.

1379
01:13:03,905 --> 01:13:04,625
Let me see that.

1380
01:13:09,452 --> 01:13:10,203
This is perfect.

1381
01:13:10,495 --> 01:13:11,871
This is just what we need.

1382
01:13:12,163 --> 01:13:13,039
[sighs]

1383
01:13:13,332 --> 01:13:14,653
It's about time
I caught a brake.

1384
01:13:14,667 --> 01:13:16,335
God is good.

1385
01:13:16,627 --> 01:13:18,468

to his admission.

1387
01:13:20,047 --> 01:13:21,674
No sir, not this month.

1388
01:13:29,307 --> 01:13:33,103
Better uh, better get
over to the church.

1389
01:13:33,395 --> 01:13:34,521
Yeah.

1390
01:13:34,813 --> 01:13:36,982

01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:41,237

how this affects our court date.

See you later Toni Jo.

01:13:50,497 --> 01:13:51,873
See you Toni Jo.

love, my lawyers think

1397
01:14:01,008 --> 01:14:03,720
my trial will take place
the first part of next year,

1398
01:14:04,012 --> 01:14:06,305
what with the war and all.

1399
01:14:06,597 --> 01:14:08,850
I just wish you
could come see me.

1400
01:14:09,142 --> 01:14:11,477
My place looks real good.

1401
01:14:11,769 --> 01:14:14,023
Father Richard's
been here a lot.

1402
01:14:14,314 --> 01:14:16,567
He's starting to
make sense to me.

1403
01:14:16,859 --> 01:14:17,943
But don't Worry.

1404
01:14:18,235 --> 01:14:23,198
I'm not ready to become
a nun yet, ha, ha.

1405
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:25,160
Wish me luck on the next trial.

1406
01:14:25,452 --> 01:14:27,996
I love you, Toni Jo.

1407
01:14:33,626 --> 01:14:35,837
Prosecution may call
its next witness.

1408
01:14:36,129 --> 01:14:38,924
State your name and
occupation for the record.

1409
01:14:39,216 --> 01:14:41,427
My name is George
McQuiston, and I'm currently

1410
01:14:41,719 --> 01:14:43,399
on leave from Louisiana
State Police, where

1411
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:45,014
I hold the rank of captain.

1412
01:14:45,306 --> 01:14:49,227
Mr. McQuiston, has anybody told
you not come to this courtroom?

1413
01:14:49,519 --> 01:14:50,562
No sir.

1414
01:14:50,854 --> 01:14:52,175
Has anybody tried
to prevent you

1415
01:14:52,397 --> 01:14:53,690
from coming to this courtroom?

1416
01:14:53,982 --> 01:14:56,568
No sir.

1417
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:59,279
Then I hereby find you
in contempt of court.

1418
01:14:59,571 --> 01:15:02,116
And immediately following your
testimony, you will be arrested

1419
01:15:02,408 --> 01:15:04,577
and remanded to the
custody of Sheriff Reid.

1420
01:15:04,869 --> 01:15:08,039
Is that understood?

1421
01:15:08,331 --> 01:15:09,582
Yes your honor.

1422
01:15:09,874 --> 01:15:12,251
Mr. McQuiston,
you did not testify

1423
01:15:12,543 --> 01:15:14,046
at Mrs. Henry's first trial.

1424
01:15:14,338 --> 01:15:15,422
Is that correct?

1425
01:15:15,714 --> 01:15:18,008
That is correct.

1426
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:21,345
Would you like to tell us why?

1427
01:15:21,637 --> 01:15:25,350
Well, Annie B. Is my
niece, and um, she's

1428
01:15:25,642 --> 01:15:26,893
had a pretty hard life.

1429
01:15:27,185 --> 01:15:28,394
Isn't it your duty as a
representative of the state

1430
01:15:28,686 --> 01:15:30,726
police to testify to the
truth of a criminal matter,

1431
01:15:30,772 --> 01:15:32,052
even if the person
is a relative?

1432
01:15:32,107 --> 01:15:33,316
Yes sir.

1433
01:15:33,608 --> 01:15:34,901
It's Why I turned myself in.

1434
01:15:38,656 --> 01:15:41,534
You heard your sister, Mrs.
Holt, testify in this trial

1435
01:15:41,826 --> 01:15:46,580
that she called you about
the defendant, Mrs. Henry.

1436
01:15:46,872 --> 01:15:48,165
Yes sir.

1437
01:15:48,457 --> 01:15:50,378
PROSECUTOR: Could you tell
the court what happens

1438
01:15:50,502 --> 01:15:53,421
when you arrived at her house?

1439
01:15:53,713 --> 01:15:56,174
Well, Emma was, she was upset.

1440
01:15:56,466 --> 01:16:00,470
And um, I told her to sit tight
and that I'd be there directly.

1441
01:16:00,762 --> 01:16:03,432
Annie B., I want you to tell
me exactly what happened.

1442
01:16:07,019 --> 01:16:12,233
It's like I didn't know what
I was doing, like I was crazed.

1443
01:16:12,525 --> 01:16:14,778
Listen, I want to help you out.

1444
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:17,447
And I'm going to,
but you're going

1445
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:19,199
to have to tell me the truth.

1446
01:16:30,712 --> 01:16:33,339
We needed his car.

1447
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:41,307
We was going to rob
a bank for the money.

1448
01:16:45,269 --> 01:16:48,647
You then handed her
over to Sheriff Reid?

1449
01:16:48,939 --> 01:16:49,861
MR. MCQUISTON: Yes sir.

1450
01:16:50,150 --> 01:16:51,071
No further questions.

1451
01:16:54,446 --> 01:16:57,532
Mr. McQuiston, I'm interested
in exactly what you promised

1452
01:16:57,824 --> 01:16:59,064
your niece in return for her...

1453
01:16:59,075 --> 01:16:59,955
PROSECUTOR: Objection.

1454
01:17:00,243 --> 01:17:01,495
Sustained.

1455
01:17:01,787 --> 01:17:02,914
Your honor, I believe
George McQuiston has already

1456
01:17:03,206 --> 01:17:04,582
testified that he'd help her.

1457
01:17:04,874 --> 01:17:06,876
The objection is
sustained Mr. Moss.

1458
01:17:07,251 --> 01:17:07,751
Sit down.

1459
01:17:12,131 --> 01:17:14,343
O K.

1460
01:17:14,635 --> 01:17:16,970
Why'd Miss Henry tell you
she shot Mr. Galloway?

1461
01:17:17,262 --> 01:17:18,902
MR. MCQUISTON: Because
she wanted his car.

1462
01:17:19,014 --> 01:17:20,349
No, that's not what I mean.

1463
01:17:20,641 --> 01:17:21,767
I mean, Why do you think she
was so willing to discuss

1464
01:17:22,059 --> 01:17:23,477
this with you?

1465
01:17:23,769 --> 01:17:25,230
I couldn't say.

1466
01:17:25,521 --> 01:17:26,648
Wasn't it because you and your
sister promised her you'd help

1467
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:27,440
her?

1468
01:17:27,607 --> 01:17:28,107
Objection.

1469
01:17:28,274 --> 01:17:28,794
Your honor...

1470
01:17:28,942 --> 01:17:30,401
Sustained.

1471
01:17:30,693 --> 01:17:31,653
There'll be no further questions
regarding what may or may not

1472
01:17:31,945 --> 01:17:33,345
have been promised
to the defendant.

1473
01:17:40,496 --> 01:17:42,539
Does that mean you have
no further questions

1474
01:17:42,831 --> 01:17:44,250
for the Witness?

1475
01:17:44,541 --> 01:17:45,459
Well, obviously, if every time
I try to ask a question you

1476
01:17:45,751 --> 01:17:47,211
forbid it...

1477
01:17:47,503 --> 01:17:48,754
Watch it Mr. Anderson, or I'll
hold you in contempt of court,

1478
01:17:49,047 --> 01:17:51,299
and you'll find yourself
spending the night in jail.

1479
01:17:56,221 --> 01:17:57,973
No further
questions your honor.

1480
01:17:58,265 --> 01:17:59,516
Next witness.

1481
01:17:59,808 --> 01:18:02,645
The state calls Horace
Finnon Burkes to the stand.

1482
01:18:02,937 --> 01:18:03,980
[chatter]

1483
01:18:04,272 --> 01:18:05,481
JUDGE: I will have
order in this courtroom,

1484
01:18:05,773 --> 01:18:07,233
or I will clear the courtroom.

1485
01:18:29,132 --> 01:18:31,217
Stand up please.

1486
01:18:31,509 --> 01:18:32,389
Raise your right hand.

1487
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:33,636
Put the other on the bible.

1488
01:18:33,928 --> 01:18:35,096
Do you swear to tell the
whole truth, and nothing

1489
01:18:35,388 --> 01:18:36,628
but the truth, so help you god?

1490
01:18:36,848 --> 01:18:37,474
ARKIE: I do.

1491
01:18:37,766 --> 01:18:40,185
BAILIFF: Have a seat.

1492
01:18:40,477 --> 01:18:43,814
PROSECUTOR: State your
name for the record.

1493
01:18:44,106 --> 01:18:46,400
ARKIE: Horace Finnon Burkes.

1494
01:18:46,692 --> 01:18:49,279
You also go by the name Arkie?

1495
01:18:49,571 --> 01:18:50,238
Yeah.

1496
01:18:50,530 --> 01:18:51,197
My friends call me Arkie.

1497
01:18:51,489 --> 01:18:52,532
I don't mean Yorkie.

1498
01:18:52,824 --> 01:18:54,117
[laughter]

1499
01:18:58,705 --> 01:19:02,585
Mr. Burkes, you've
already been sentenced

1500
01:19:02,877 --> 01:19:05,254
to die for the murder
of Joseph P. Galloway.

1501
01:19:05,546 --> 01:19:06,213
Is that correct?

1502
01:19:06,505 --> 01:19:07,923
Yes sir.

1503
01:19:08,215 --> 01:19:11,260
So you have nothing to gain
by your testimony here today?

1504
01:19:11,552 --> 01:19:12,473
Objection your honor.

1505
01:19:12,678 --> 01:19:13,388
Overruled.

1506
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:15,390
You may answer the question.

1507
01:19:15,682 --> 01:19:17,267
No sir.

1508
01:19:17,559 --> 01:19:19,561
Nothing to gain.

1509
01:19:19,853 --> 01:19:23,482
Tell us what happened when you
got picked up by Mr. Galloway.

1510
01:19:23,774 --> 01:19:25,610
Well, We did hitchhike.

1511
01:19:25,902 --> 01:19:28,946
We were given a ride
by Mr. Galloway.

1512
01:19:29,238 --> 01:19:31,783
Toni Jo had the only
gun with bullets.

1513
01:19:32,075 --> 01:19:34,410
She wanted to put him in the
turtle back to keep him quiet.

1514
01:19:34,702 --> 01:19:36,120
That's... that's a lie!

1515
01:19:36,412 --> 01:19:39,958
Counsel, if you can't keep
your client quiet, I will.

1516
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:44,296
Continue, Mr. Burkes.

1517
01:19:44,588 --> 01:19:46,215
I did slam his hand
in the turtleback,

1518
01:19:46,507 --> 01:19:48,258
but it was an accident.

1519
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:49,803
Go on.

1520
01:19:50,095 --> 01:19:52,430
After we were
driving for a while,

1521
01:19:52,722 --> 01:19:55,683
Toni Jo wanted me to
pull off the road because

1522
01:19:55,975 --> 01:19:58,144
of his hollerin' on
account of his cut hand.

1523
01:19:58,436 --> 01:19:59,836
PROSECUTOR: You
pulled off the road?

1524
01:19:59,938 --> 01:20:01,107
Yep.

1525
01:20:01,399 --> 01:20:02,858
And she wanted him to strip.

1526
01:20:03,150 --> 01:20:04,735
Son of a bitch is lying.

1527
01:20:05,027 --> 01:20:07,947
I will not have any further
antics from the defendant.

1528
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:09,824
Is that clear?

1529
01:20:10,116 --> 01:20:10,797
Yes your honor.

1530
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:14,460
PROSECUTOR: Continue.

1531
01:20:17,624 --> 01:20:21,670
After he undressed, we walked
him behind these rice stacks.

1532
01:20:24,464 --> 01:20:26,843
Toni Jo told me to take his
clothes back to the car.

1533
01:20:30,888 --> 01:20:32,723
[gun shot]

1534
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:40,940
Toni Jo, what'd you do?

1535
01:20:41,024 --> 01:20:41,864
Just shut up Arkie.

1536
01:20:42,067 --> 01:20:43,026
It's none of your damn business.

1537
01:20:43,318 --> 01:20:44,445
Get back to the car.

1538
01:20:44,736 --> 01:20:46,697
Did you kill him Toni Jo?

1539
01:20:46,989 --> 01:20:48,657
Pick up the clothes.

1540
01:20:48,950 --> 01:20:49,450
Come on!

1541
01:20:49,617 --> 01:20:50,076
Pick up the clothes!

1542
01:20:50,410 --> 01:20:50,994
Let's go!

1543
01:20:51,286 --> 01:20:53,204
You killed him Toni Jo!

1544
01:20:53,496 --> 01:20:54,038
Why?

1545
01:20:54,330 --> 01:20:55,874
TONI: Shut up Arkie!

1546
01:20:56,166 --> 01:20:59,961
PROSECUTOR: Where
did you drive to?

1547
01:21:00,253 --> 01:21:03,757
I told her we should go
to Arkansas to rob a bank.

1548
01:21:04,049 --> 01:21:04,717
What happened?

1549
01:21:05,009 --> 01:21:05,649
Bank was gone.

1550
01:21:05,718 --> 01:21:07,011
[laughing]

1551
01:21:07,303 --> 01:21:08,888
She was sore.

1552
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:11,265
[crowd laughing]

1553
01:21:11,557 --> 01:21:12,893
I knew there was no bank there.

1554
01:21:13,185 --> 01:21:16,980
I just wanted to get as
close to my home as I could.

1555
01:21:17,272 --> 01:21:20,025
So what did you do next?

1556
01:21:20,317 --> 01:21:23,528
I told her we'd find a
place to hide out for a bit

1557
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:25,615
and then go on to another town.

1558
01:21:25,907 --> 01:21:27,587
TONI: I thought we said
there was a bank we

1559
01:21:27,867 --> 01:21:28,788
could rob in this town.

1560
01:21:28,868 --> 01:21:30,077
ARKIE: There used to be.

1561
01:21:30,369 --> 01:21:32,330
How was I to know
it was dried up?

1562
01:21:32,622 --> 01:21:34,022
Well, now what
are we going to do?

1563
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,666
We'll find another one.

1564
01:21:35,958 --> 01:21:38,279
Well, thanks to you, we don't
hardly have any money left.

1565
01:21:38,378 --> 01:21:39,171
Yeah.

1566
01:21:39,463 --> 01:21:40,130
L... I'm going to
get me something

1567
01:21:40,422 --> 01:21:40,839
to drink with that money.

1568
01:21:41,131 --> 01:21:41,771
Not now Arkie.

1569
01:21:42,049 --> 01:21:43,550
We've got to think.

1570
01:21:43,842 --> 01:21:45,677
I think we need
bullets for the guns.

1571
01:21:45,969 --> 01:21:47,129
I should go out and get some.

1572
01:21:50,183 --> 01:21:52,560
That's the first good idea
you've had in a long time.

1573
01:21:55,438 --> 01:21:56,731
Where's that fella's money?

1574
01:21:59,776 --> 01:22:01,487
Here.

1575
01:22:01,779 --> 01:22:02,700
Trade that for bullets.

1576
01:22:08,786 --> 01:22:09,286
Arkie.

1577
01:22:12,289 --> 01:22:13,170
Don't double cross me.

1578
01:22:17,796 --> 01:22:20,924
PROSECUTOR: So you were
afraid for your life?

1579
01:22:21,216 --> 01:22:25,096
I was afraid she'd do me like
she did that Mr. Galloway.

1580
01:22:25,388 --> 01:22:28,349
No further
questions your honor.

1581
01:22:28,641 --> 01:22:30,161
The defense may
question the witness.

1582
01:22:32,687 --> 01:22:35,940
Well, I could certainly
see how such a big man

1583
01:22:36,232 --> 01:22:39,069
will be intimidated by such
an imposing accomplice.

1584
01:22:39,361 --> 01:22:39,861
Objection.

1585
01:22:40,153 --> 01:22:41,113
I apologize.

1586
01:22:41,405 --> 01:22:42,885
I apologize, I
apologize, I apologize.

1587
01:22:42,990 --> 01:22:44,449
I withdraw the comment.

1588
01:22:44,741 --> 01:22:46,493
Watch the sarcasm Mr. Anderson.

1589
01:22:46,785 --> 01:22:47,466
Yes your honor.

1590
01:22:50,331 --> 01:22:53,793
Arkie, after you were
convicted and sentenced

1591
01:22:54,085 --> 01:22:55,406
to death for killing
Mr. Galloway,

1592
01:22:55,628 --> 01:22:57,171
weren't you hoping
for another trial?

1593
01:22:57,463 --> 01:22:58,590
Yes.

1594
01:22:58,881 --> 01:23:00,550
But it was denied.

1595
01:23:00,843 --> 01:23:02,886
Arkie, did you recently
send Miss Henry a letter?

1596
01:23:03,178 --> 01:23:04,305
PROSECUTOR: Objection.

1597
01:23:04,597 --> 01:23:05,931
Your honor, this letter
was sent to Miss Henry

1598
01:23:06,223 --> 01:23:08,343
by Mr. Burkes, and I feel
it is relevant to this case.

1599
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:10,102
Let me see the
letter Mr. Anderson.

1600
01:23:18,028 --> 01:23:18,820
I'll allow it.

1601
01:23:19,112 --> 01:23:21,239
Objection overruled.

1602
01:23:21,531 --> 01:23:22,324
Thank you.

1603
01:23:26,245 --> 01:23:27,788
Arkie, did you recently
send Miss Henry

1604
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:30,560
a letter promising her that you
would shoulder the entire blame

1605
01:23:30,583 --> 01:23:32,023
for the killing if
she would help you

1606
01:23:32,126 --> 01:23:33,166
with a possible jailbreak?

1607
01:23:33,419 --> 01:23:35,129
I just wanted to
see what she'd say.

1608
01:23:35,421 --> 01:23:38,717
CLEMENT: Just to be
clear, is that a yes?

1609
01:23:39,009 --> 01:23:40,469
Yes.

1610
01:23:40,761 --> 01:23:43,138
Isn't it true Arkie that you
did in fact fire a fatal shot

1611
01:23:43,430 --> 01:23:45,140
to Mr. Galloway?

1612
01:23:45,432 --> 01:23:46,391
No sir.

1613
01:23:46,683 --> 01:23:48,310
CLEMENT: You know
how to fire a gun?

1614
01:23:48,603 --> 01:23:49,312
Yeah sir.

1615
01:23:49,604 --> 01:23:50,324
I was in the army.

1616
01:23:50,563 --> 01:23:51,644
Oh, you were in the army?

1617
01:23:51,814 --> 01:23:52,732
They teach you how
to fire a weapon?

1618
01:23:53,024 --> 01:23:54,233
Yes sir.

1619
01:23:54,525 --> 01:23:55,818
Wasn't it the business
of the United States army

1620
01:23:56,110 --> 01:23:57,236
to teach all their good
soldiers to fire their weapons

1621
01:23:57,528 --> 01:23:58,029
accurately?

1622
01:23:58,321 --> 01:23:58,821
They Try-

1623
01:23:58,946 --> 01:23:59,586
- Is that a yes?

1624
01:23:59,614 --> 01:24:00,114
Yes.

1625
01:24:04,536 --> 01:24:06,372
So after you were
instructed in how

1626
01:24:06,664 --> 01:24:09,958
to fire your weapon with
deadly accuracy, isn't it true

1627
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:12,503
you deserted the army
of the United States?

1628
01:24:12,796 --> 01:24:13,672
Yes.

1629
01:24:13,963 --> 01:24:16,174
But I was going
to turn myself in.

1630
01:24:16,466 --> 01:24:18,343
Yeah, I'm sure.

1631
01:24:18,635 --> 01:24:20,387
It was a yes, wasn't it?

1632
01:24:20,679 --> 01:24:21,513
Yes.

1633
01:24:21,805 --> 01:24:23,126
Weren't you
convicted and served

1634
01:24:23,306 --> 01:24:25,476
time in Huntsville, Texas
for armed robbery Arkie?

1635
01:24:28,354 --> 01:24:30,481
Yes sir.

1636
01:24:30,773 --> 01:24:32,233
Thank you.

1637
01:24:32,525 --> 01:24:33,859
No further questions your honor.

1638
01:24:34,151 --> 01:24:35,945
Uh, your honor,
I'd like to redirect

1639
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:37,823
a question to the witness.

1640
01:24:38,115 --> 01:24:39,866
Go ahead Mr. Patterson.

1641
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:42,786
What was your purpose
in writing to Mrs. Henry?

1642
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:51,504
I knew she'd lie about
who fired the gun.

1643
01:24:51,796 --> 01:24:53,957
I figured she'd have a better
chance getting off, being

1644
01:24:54,215 --> 01:24:57,468
a good looking woman and all.

1645
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,179
Then she could help me escape.

1646
01:25:00,471 --> 01:25:01,765
Another well thought out plan.

1647
01:25:02,057 --> 01:25:03,434
Thank you Mr. Burkes.

1648
01:25:03,726 --> 01:25:04,601
No more questions.

1649
01:25:04,893 --> 01:25:07,396
Your honor, the
prosecution rests.

1650
01:25:10,107 --> 01:25:11,150
The jury's back.

1651
01:25:11,442 --> 01:25:12,843
We need y'all back
in the courtroom.

1652
01:25:13,111 --> 01:25:13,951
[inaudible] an hour.

1653
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:14,913
Is it good or bad?

1654
01:25:36,469 --> 01:25:38,180
What's with the bag?

1655
01:25:38,472 --> 01:25:41,725
The archdiocese send you with
a poisonous snake for my cell?

1656
01:25:42,017 --> 01:25:44,978
The orders are orders you know.

1657
01:25:45,270 --> 01:25:46,438
It needs to be quicker.

1658
01:25:49,317 --> 01:25:51,027
You ready?

1659
01:25:51,736 --> 01:25:52,236
OK.

1660
01:25:55,615 --> 01:25:56,115
[gasp]

1661
01:25:56,365 --> 01:25:58,826
Oh my god!

1662
01:25:59,118 --> 01:26:01,747
What a sweet little boy you are!

1663
01:26:02,039 --> 01:26:04,333
Well then, you'd
better look again.

1664
01:26:05,083 --> 01:26:05,583
[gasp]

1665
01:26:05,751 --> 01:26:06,877
Oh.

1666
01:26:07,169 --> 01:26:09,379
Well, then I'll, I'll
call you Jezebel in honor

1667
01:26:09,671 --> 01:26:11,840
of you and your religion.

1668
01:26:12,132 --> 01:26:13,426
But I'll go by Bell.

1669
01:26:13,718 --> 01:26:14,719
Mhm.

1670
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:15,970
Aw.

1671
01:26:19,349 --> 01:26:19,849
Oh.

1672
01:26:31,111 --> 01:26:34,365
It's been a long
time since someone's

1673
01:26:34,657 --> 01:26:37,536
done something so nice for me.

1674
01:26:37,828 --> 01:26:41,081
And I'm glad I could.

1675
01:26:41,373 --> 01:26:44,042
You restored my faith.

1676
01:26:44,334 --> 01:26:48,004
Well, I have been waiting
a while to hear those words.

1677
01:26:51,217 --> 01:26:57,431
In mankind Father, not god.

1678
01:26:57,723 --> 01:26:59,267
Don't you know?

1679
01:26:59,559 --> 01:27:04,064
That is how God loves you,
through people like me.

1680
01:27:07,651 --> 01:27:10,153
So that's how he's shown his
love for me for the first 20

1681
01:27:10,445 --> 01:27:11,905
years of my life?

1682
01:27:12,197 --> 01:27:15,034
Through all the wonderful people
who have guided, and nurtured,

1683
01:27:15,326 --> 01:27:16,077
and loved me?

1684
01:27:24,503 --> 01:27:28,841
Nothing goes unnoticed,
and that includes you,

1685
01:27:29,133 --> 01:27:32,845
and the injustices in your life.

1686
01:27:33,137 --> 01:27:35,222
He's just waiting for
you to reach out to him.

1687
01:27:35,514 --> 01:27:36,725
He'll do the rest.

1688
01:27:45,066 --> 01:27:47,360
Remember when I brought
that reporter fellow here,

1689
01:27:47,652 --> 01:27:52,658
and you nearly cussed
out a man of the cloth?

1690
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:54,869
Don't you just hate
"I told you" so's?

1691
01:27:55,161 --> 01:27:55,661
[laughs]

1692
01:27:55,912 --> 01:27:56,996
No.

1693
01:27:57,288 --> 01:28:00,041
You received I don't
know, more than $120.

1694
01:28:00,333 --> 01:28:02,127
So far.

1695
01:28:02,419 --> 01:28:05,213
Well, that's not very
specific for an accountant.

1696
01:28:05,505 --> 01:28:08,967
Besides, not all of them
letters have been sugar.

1697
01:28:09,259 --> 01:28:14,140
Some people know the Lord's
compassion, and some don't.

1698
01:28:14,432 --> 01:28:16,309
What are you
working on Toni Jo?

1699
01:28:16,601 --> 01:28:17,852
My execution dress.

1700
01:28:32,826 --> 01:28:34,620
They're talking about
an electric chair.

1701
01:28:42,170 --> 01:28:44,005
I'm having a hard
time facing her.

1702
01:28:56,978 --> 01:29:00,440
May I read you something?

1703
01:29:00,732 --> 01:29:03,527
No more bad news, please.

1704
01:29:03,819 --> 01:29:07,030
This is a bit of good news.

1705
01:29:11,118 --> 01:29:15,331
The teachers of the law brought
in a woman caught in adultery.

1706
01:29:15,623 --> 01:29:17,250
They made her stand
before the group

1707
01:29:17,542 --> 01:29:21,087
and said to Jesus,
teacher, this woman

1708
01:29:21,379 --> 01:29:23,006
was caught in the
act of adultery.

1709
01:29:23,297 --> 01:29:27,261
In the law, Moses commanded
us to stone such women.

1710
01:29:27,553 --> 01:29:29,722
Jesus bent down and
started to write

1711
01:29:30,014 --> 01:29:31,974
on the ground with his finger.

1712
01:29:32,266 --> 01:29:33,684
When they kept on
questioning him,

1713
01:29:33,976 --> 01:29:38,606
he straightened up and said
to them, if any one of you

1714
01:29:38,898 --> 01:29:43,987
is without sin, let him be the
first to throw a stone at her.

1715
01:29:44,279 --> 01:29:47,490
Again, he stooped down
and wrote on the ground

1716
01:29:47,782 --> 01:29:51,328
that this, those who
heard, began to go away.

1717
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:56,625
Jesus straightened up and asked
her, woman, where are they?

1718
01:29:56,917 --> 01:29:57,917
Has no one condemned you?

1719
01:29:58,169 --> 01:30:01,298
No one sir, she said.

1720
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:07,512
Than neither do I condemn
you, declared Jesus.

1721
01:30:07,804 --> 01:30:10,223
Go now and leave
your life of sin.

1722
01:30:14,062 --> 01:30:17,065
What was he writing
on the ground?

1723
01:30:17,356 --> 01:30:18,608
No one really knows.

1724
01:30:22,570 --> 01:30:24,090
The holy roller's
killed some, right?

1725
01:30:28,577 --> 01:30:32,081
Mercy is hard to come by.

1726
01:30:32,372 --> 01:30:37,670
Jesus was wrongfully charged
and wrongfully put to death.

1727
01:30:37,962 --> 01:30:41,091
And still, he is willing
to die for our offenses.

1728
01:30:49,058 --> 01:30:51,811
Only he can give
you what you need.

1729
01:31:44,784 --> 01:31:46,161
Stop right there cowboy.

1730
01:31:50,791 --> 01:31:53,586
The bastards owe
us a phone call.

1731
01:31:53,878 --> 01:31:56,463
I'm working on
another plan baby.

1732
01:31:56,755 --> 01:31:58,257
So this is the good part.

1733
01:31:58,549 --> 01:32:02,429
It'll be a long time before
you see those pearly gates.

1734
01:32:02,721 --> 01:32:05,348
They can't do this to you.

1735
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:08,435
Anyways, you'll always
be my pearl in the rough.

1736
01:32:08,727 --> 01:32:09,686
[laughs]

1737
01:32:09,978 --> 01:32:11,458
I think he means
diamond in the rough.

1738
01:32:11,730 --> 01:32:15,610
Well, either way, he
got the rough part of it.

1739
01:32:15,902 --> 01:32:17,703
We'll see what I can do
about that phone call.

1740
01:32:17,820 --> 01:32:18,700
(WHISPERS) Thank you.

1741
01:32:21,574 --> 01:32:23,784
O K.

1742
01:32:24,076 --> 01:32:26,997
Well, what questions do
you have for me this week?

1743
01:32:27,289 --> 01:32:28,498
O K.

1744
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:32,211
Well, the last thing I
have is the vast mysteries

1745
01:32:32,502 --> 01:32:34,546
of the universe
should only confirm

1746
01:32:34,838 --> 01:32:38,843
our belief and the
certainty of its creator.

1747
01:32:39,135 --> 01:32:41,387
I thought we'd
moved on from that.

1748
01:32:41,679 --> 01:32:43,723
Don't want to talk
about Darwin, eh father?

1749
01:32:44,015 --> 01:32:45,642
Absolutely.

1750
01:32:45,934 --> 01:32:48,187
God gave you a mind
to question, and that

1751
01:32:48,479 --> 01:32:49,730
is how you obtain true faith.

1752
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:54,008
So you think I
need to get dunked?

1753
01:32:56,904 --> 01:32:59,156
We don't dunk.

1754
01:32:59,448 --> 01:33:01,284
We sprinkle.

1755
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:04,120
And yes.

1756
01:33:04,412 --> 01:33:05,664
O K.

1757
01:33:05,956 --> 01:33:07,082
Well, let's do it quick then
before I change my mind.

1758
01:33:07,374 --> 01:33:09,417
It's not like taking
castor oil Toni Jo.

1759
01:33:09,709 --> 01:33:15,549
It's, it's an opportunity
for a new life.

1760
01:33:15,841 --> 01:33:17,593
I do believe father.

1761
01:33:21,180 --> 01:33:22,515
I need to believe.

1762
01:33:26,103 --> 01:33:26,603
Help me.

1763
01:33:36,447 --> 01:33:38,688
Do you think they'll let you
out here for about an hour

1764
01:33:38,866 --> 01:33:39,366
tomorrow?

1765
01:33:44,789 --> 01:33:48,043
[music playing - hymn]

1766
01:34:14,447 --> 01:34:17,241
No more trial misgate.

1767
01:34:17,533 --> 01:34:22,204
No more robbing banks, and
no more hurting people baby.

1768
01:34:22,496 --> 01:34:25,834
TONI (ON PHONE):
(WHISPERING) Please be good.

1769
01:34:26,126 --> 01:34:27,126
I can't listen to this.

1770
01:34:31,506 --> 01:34:33,675
You know I can't
stand to hear you cry.

1771
01:34:36,679 --> 01:34:39,015
But I sure as hell can't
accept not seeing you again.

1772
01:34:43,061 --> 01:34:44,979
It was my last
request to talk to you,

1773
01:34:45,271 --> 01:34:46,751
so please tell me
what I need to hear.

1774
01:34:50,611 --> 01:34:51,111
O K.

1775
01:34:54,531 --> 01:34:58,202
TONI (ON PHONE): I was selfish.

1776
01:34:58,494 --> 01:35:01,373
I always felt so alone.

1777
01:35:01,664 --> 01:35:05,126
[inaudible] did to you cowboy.

1778
01:35:05,418 --> 01:35:09,047
And I always hoped that there
was a god running the show.

1779
01:35:12,551 --> 01:35:16,722
And I just wished
maybe I could, just

1780
01:35:17,014 --> 01:35:19,892
maybe I could still just
one more act with you.

1781
01:35:23,479 --> 01:35:24,815
Just one little act.

1782
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:32,072
Put your faith in god.

1783
01:35:32,364 --> 01:35:33,324
Live a law-abiding life.

1784
01:35:38,204 --> 01:35:39,539
<i>I'll</i> be good sweetheart.

1785
01:35:45,086 --> 01:35:47,213
And you never, whatever
you do, you never

1786
01:35:47,505 --> 01:35:49,925
walk out that back door again.

1787
01:35:50,217 --> 01:35:55,806
You behave like a man and
make your momma and me proud.

1788
01:35:56,098 --> 01:36:00,061
And you always walk
out that front door.

1789
01:36:04,190 --> 01:36:05,024
You hear me love?

1790
01:36:17,079 --> 01:36:18,914
(WHISPERING) Well,
I've got to go now.

1791
01:36:24,504 --> 01:36:25,881
I love you forever.

1792
01:36:30,469 --> 01:36:32,095
I love you too Toni Jo.

1793
01:36:55,829 --> 01:36:58,665
[sobbing]

1794
01:37:06,216 --> 01:37:06,716
Father?

1795
01:37:10,595 --> 01:37:11,876
Would you step out for a minute?

1796
01:37:15,768 --> 01:37:16,977
Why?

1797
01:37:17,269 --> 01:37:18,521
Why... why's he got to leave?

1798
01:37:18,812 --> 01:37:20,648
It's only for a couple
of minutes Toni Jo.

1799
01:37:20,940 --> 01:37:22,191
He can come back.

1800
01:37:46,008 --> 01:37:48,262
TONI: (SCREAMING) No!

1801
01:37:48,554 --> 01:37:50,264
[inaudible]

1802
01:37:50,556 --> 01:37:53,308
[crying]

1803
01:37:54,268 --> 01:37:56,186
That was not right!

1804
01:37:56,478 --> 01:37:58,647
It was supposed to be hanging!

1805
01:37:58,939 --> 01:38:00,984
Father, I need
you back in there.

1806
01:38:01,276 --> 01:38:03,437
They're going to cut off all
her hair for the cap mask.

1807
01:38:03,695 --> 01:38:04,862
TONI: Get away from me!

1808
01:38:05,154 --> 01:38:07,824
(WHISPERING) on god.

1809
01:38:08,116 --> 01:38:08,956
TONI: Father Richard!

1810
01:38:12,454 --> 01:38:15,749
[crying]

1811
01:38:24,718 --> 01:38:28,430
I want my other father.

1812
01:38:28,722 --> 01:38:30,890
It's all I have left,
and they want to take it.

1813
01:38:34,311 --> 01:38:35,687
It's all I have left.

1814
01:38:35,980 --> 01:38:37,648
Oh god.

1815
01:38:37,940 --> 01:38:39,233
Toni Jo.

1816
01:38:43,821 --> 01:38:47,199
Annie B. Look at me.

1817
01:38:54,291 --> 01:38:57,544
You are more than your hair.

1818
01:39:00,548 --> 01:39:02,300
You are more than your looks.

1819
01:39:04,969 --> 01:39:10,224
And you are braver than
anyone in this room.

1820
01:39:13,646 --> 01:39:20,277
You have been such a bright
and colorful spot in my life.

1821
01:39:20,569 --> 01:39:28,570
And because you're a bright and
colorful person, you're unique,

1822
01:39:29,996 --> 01:39:31,623
and you have worth.

1823
01:39:31,915 --> 01:39:36,796
And no one can
take that from you.

1824
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:40,174
You can do this.

1825
01:39:40,466 --> 01:39:44,720
You can do this, because
I won't leave your side,

1826
01:39:45,012 --> 01:39:50,185
not even for one minute
before you leave this world

1827
01:39:50,477 --> 01:39:52,938
for the glory that awaits you.

1828
01:39:57,526 --> 01:39:59,444
Then can I have my hair back?

1829
01:40:06,828 --> 01:40:09,455
(WHISPERING) Of course.

1830
01:40:09,747 --> 01:40:12,167
What would an angel be
without her glorious hair?

1831
01:40:20,259 --> 01:40:22,636
[sniffling]

1832
01:41:06,601 --> 01:41:09,395
He stays.

1833
01:41:09,687 --> 01:41:10,438
No problem.

1834
01:41:17,821 --> 01:41:20,407
FATHER RICHARD: You just
close your eyes and listen

1835
01:41:20,699 --> 01:41:23,494
to my words, words of truth.

1836
01:41:33,004 --> 01:41:37,384
Humble yourselves therefore,
under God's mighty hand

1837
01:41:37,676 --> 01:41:40,888
so that he may lift
you up in due time.

1838
01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:45,392
Cast all your anxiety on him,
because he cares for you.

1839
01:41:48,230 --> 01:41:50,148
What benefit did you
reap at that time

1840
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:53,068
when you were slaves
to sin for the things

1841
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:55,403
that you are now ashamed of?

1842
01:41:55,695 --> 01:41:59,366
Those things result in death.

1843
01:41:59,659 --> 01:42:03,830
But thanks be to God, you
have been set free from sin,

1844
01:42:04,121 --> 01:42:07,333
and have become slaves to God.

1845
01:42:07,625 --> 01:42:11,087
The benefit you reap
leads to holiness.

1846
01:42:11,379 --> 01:42:13,131
And the result is eternal life.

1847
01:42:56,386 --> 01:42:59,557
Bless the Lord with all my soul.

1848
01:42:59,849 --> 01:43:03,561
Bless his holy [inaudible].

1849
01:43:03,853 --> 01:43:06,564
Bless the lord with all my soul.

1850
01:43:06,856 --> 01:43:10,568
Forget not all he has given.

1851
01:43:10,860 --> 01:43:16,575
Bless [inaudible] and
all that is within.

1852
01:43:16,867 --> 01:43:20,078
Bless the lord,
[inaudible], who redeem

1853
01:43:20,370 --> 01:43:21,663
in thy love and [inaudible].

1854
01:43:43,729 --> 01:43:47,024
And the saying that is
written will come true.

1855
01:43:47,316 --> 01:43:51,196
Death has been
swallowed up in victory.

1856
01:43:51,488 --> 01:43:55,283
Where, o death, is your victory?

1857
01:43:55,575 --> 01:43:59,454
Where, o death, is
your [inaudible]?

1858
01:43:59,747 --> 01:44:04,502
The sting of death is sin, and
the power of sin is the law.

1859
01:44:04,794 --> 01:44:09,131
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not Want.

1860
01:44:09,423 --> 01:44:12,344
He maketh me to lie
down in green pastures,

1861
01:44:12,636 --> 01:44:15,430
he leadeth me beside
the still waters.

1862
01:44:15,722 --> 01:44:18,308
He restoreth my soul.

1863
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:22,479
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for his namesake.

1864
01:44:36,245 --> 01:44:40,374
Yea, though I Walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

1865
01:44:40,666 --> 01:44:45,170
I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

1866
01:44:45,462 --> 01:44:48,383
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

1867
01:44:48,675 --> 01:44:51,553
Thou preparest a table
before me in the presence

1868
01:44:51,845 --> 01:44:52,971
of mine enemies.

1869
01:44:53,263 --> 01:44:55,098
Thou annointest
my head with oil.

1870
01:44:55,390 --> 01:44:58,101
My cup runneth over.

1871
01:44:58,393 --> 01:45:00,771
Surely, goodness and
mercy shall follow

1872
01:45:01,063 --> 01:45:02,857
me all the days of my life.

1873
01:45:50,992 --> 01:45:54,329
And I will dwell in the
house of the Lord forever.

1874
01:45:59,042 --> 01:45:59,543
Father?

1875
01:46:07,968 --> 01:46:09,637
I know what Jesus was
writing in the sand.

1876
01:46:13,934 --> 01:46:20,440
He was writing my name, Annie
Beatrice McQuiston

1877
01:46:20,774 --> 01:46:22,275
or Toni Jo Henry.

1878
01:46:24,987 --> 01:46:26,947
I guess it took him so
long for all the bad things

1879
01:46:27,156 --> 01:46:28,157
I'd done in my life.

1880
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:32,995
And I had too many names.

1881
01:46:35,958 --> 01:46:39,628
(WHISPERING) That's
right Toni Jo.

1882
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:42,131
And it says pardoned
next to all of them.

1883
01:46:50,223 --> 01:46:52,600
You sure Jesus will
take the rap for me?

1884
01:46:56,729 --> 01:46:57,605
Guaranteed.

1885
01:47:48,703 --> 01:47:49,537
Any last words?

1886
01:48:01,967 --> 01:48:05,179
[electrocution sounds]
