In the movies, when you
beat up the neighbourhood bully,

25
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,592
you're supposed to live
happily ever after.

26
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,918
But in my neighbourhood,
that's when all
the drama starts.

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,474
It was a Friday
I'd never forget.

28
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,397
I got high
for the first time,

29
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,829
I got shot at
for the first time,

30
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,316
and I finally
kicked Debo's ass
for the first time.

31
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,592
Debo ended up going to jail
for about four years.

you lose some,

Now, there's rumours
goin'around the hood...

35
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,233
sayin'Debo is supposed to
break out next Friday.

36
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,239
And when he gets out,
he's supposed to
come and see me.

37
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,989
And today is next Friday,
and I still ain't got no job.

38
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,314

Now, as soon as my pops
found out Debo
was gettin'out,

42
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,358
he wanted me to move
with my uncle and little cousin
in Rancho Cucamonga...

43
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,596
till things calm down...

44
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,917
or Debo went back to prison,
whichever comes first.

54
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,797
I whipped Debo's ass.

00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,036

to get yourself together.

I don't believe this.

68
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,718
I told that hard-head boy
to put that hose away
and cut that grass.

69
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,912
Look at that grass.
Stanley's grass look good.

Miss Johnson's grass look good.
But look at my grass... no.

00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,789
Now, Craig, it's gonna be
different living out here.

161
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,990
Don't let your uncle
or your cousin get you
into any kind of shit.

162
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,759
- Now, you hear me?
- Pops, I'm grown now.

163
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,792
- Can't nobody
get me in trouble no more.
- I'm glad you said that, son.

164
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,434
'Cause since you grown,
don't bring your
black ass back home.

165

Hey, Uncle Willie.
Hey, how you doin',
Day-Day?

169
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,628
Where's your
big-head father?
There he is right there.

170
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,399

172
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,076
I heard you runnin'
from an ass whippin'.
It ain't even like that.

173
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,317
Talk to your brother.
If it had been me,
I'd have shot his big ass.

174
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,829
He'd have popped him.
I know he would have
popped him.

175
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,556
Hey, Willie.
How's it goin'?

176
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,955

You're just another nigga

00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,911
- Ain't that right, nephew?
- Yeah.

182
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,473
Hey, Craig?
Huh?

183
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,511
Remember what I
told you.
I'll remember.

184
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,270
Now, Lotto stud,
close my door,
and don't slam it.

185
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,832
Can't even count to ten,
all of a sudden you can
hit the Lotto.

186
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,713

I can't call it.

189
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,274
Give me that bag.
I'm gonna take this stuff
in the house for you.

190
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,949
When you finish with him,
come on in.
All right. Thanks, Unc.

191
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,708
Damn.
Yeah. Man, it's been
what, a year...

192
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,910
since the last time we kicked it
at the family reunion?

193
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,350
Yeah, it was about
a year, huh? Damn.
Yeah, man.

194
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,835
Ever since y'all moved
out here, man, it seems like
we lost touch or somethin'.

195
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,997
I know. This is a long way
from Watts, huh?
Yeah.

196
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,395
But you know what?
The good thing about
being out here,

197
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,114
we don't hear no gunshots,
no helicopters,

198
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,913
no police, no crackheads,
no chickenheads, no nothin'.

199
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,917
[Chuckles]
Yeah.
Just clean, fresh air.

200
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,508
Just smell.
[Sniffs]
Smell good, huh?

201
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,952
Tastes good.
Taste the air. Aw, man!

- Who's that?
- Some joker brothers.

206
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,110
That's Joker.
He just got out the pen.

207
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,959
And then there's Little Joker.
He just got out of Y.A.

208
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,355
And then there's
Baby Joker right there.

209
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,314
He just got out the juvenile
centre. And then they got
a little dog named Cheeco.

210
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,512
You better watch him,
'cause he's sneaky.
He'll bite the shit out of you.

But I got somethin'
better than that Cadillac.
What's that?

- Ha! What?

every now and then, I ain't
end up with a million dollars.

220

and this bad motherfucker
right here.

Yeah, I do.

- Them twenties, I just got them.
- Them ain't twenties,
but it's off the hook.

had a chance to see it.

and died when she found out
we won the lottery.

- Yeah, I know the story.
- If mama had the chance
to see this,

she'd have been
so happy, man.

things work.

Well, I'm about to get ready
to go to work,

never know nothin' about.

think about that,

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,797
You keyed my sh...
Bitch, you...

314
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,354
You keyed my shit.
[Screaming]
I got your bitch right here.

315
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,756
- Yeah, nigga, yeah!
- [Shouting, I ndistinct]
Daddy, she sprayed me!

316
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,110
Shut up,
you little punk!
Don't nobody quit me.

317
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,549
You wait till I tell Baby D'.
She gonna fuck you up!

318
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,114
[Day-Day]
She sprayed the player!
She sprayed the pimp!

319
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,515
- Better watch your back!
- [Craig]
Come on, be still!

320
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,598
Boy, it look like you got
a fatal attraction
on your hands, ain't you?

321
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,188
[Grunting]
I had two or three
of them in my day.

322
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,231
[Grunting]
Craig,

323
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,316
I hope you can handle
your women better
than this fool can.

324
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,635
[Woman] Hey, Elroy!
That's too much water.

325
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,354
Ah, no, it ain't.
Take 20 minutes.
[Grunting]

326
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,472
I've been pepper sprayed
nine times. Take 20 minutes.
[Grunting]

327
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,511
He got 19 to go.
[Shouting]

328
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,471
Come on, Craig, let me
show you the back yard.

329
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,955
You know it's bigger
than y'all's back yard.
[Continues Grunting]

330
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,072
Call the police and tell them
to get me another
restraining order!

331
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,193
Yeah, Craig, you gotta
have a little money
to live out here.

332
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,198
Yeah.
Got to have it. Now, I know
what you're thinkin'.

333
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,276
I was the one back in the day
always talkin' about...

334
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,868
"I love the hood,
I love the ghetto."

335
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,797
I was the one sayin'
I wasn't the kind of nigga...

336
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,275
make a little money
and run to the suburbs.

337
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,871
You right, that's what I said.
But as soon as I got my cheque,
I was gone!

338
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,629
Paid $ 230,000 cash
on this place.

339
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,558
Paid cash
for this, Unc?
Cash money!

340
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,195
Try to stick me with some
thirty-year payment plan.
That's for suckers.

341
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,630
Got my daddy like that
years ago on a Cadillac.
Mmm.

342
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,957
I got the only house
on the block paid for.

343
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,789
That's why I'm the king
around here.

344
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,957
Yeah, you are
the king, huh?
How you like that pool?

345
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,871
Big, ain't it?
Yeah, it's cool.

346
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,434
Where the water at?

347
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,553
Don't need no water!
We ain't got no pools
in the projects.

348
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,240
None of us swim.

349
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,510
So, y'all don't
never use it?
Never.

350
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,108
But the jacuzzi,
that's something else,

351
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,028
'cause me and my Suga
get real nasty in there.

352
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,788
Guess I left that
in there.

353
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,911
You welcome to use it
any time you want. Shit.

354
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,349
You my brother's boy!

355
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,631
That's all right, Unc.
Can't swim neither.

356
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,194
No? Good.

357
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,390
I won't have to clean up
behind your ass.

358
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,476
Come on, let me show you
something else.

359
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,874
[R & B]

360
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,035
- Hey, man, you straight?
- Hell, naw, I ain't straight.

361
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,958
Look at my eyes.
They still red?
Yeah, a little bit.

362
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,958
A little bit?
Man, she
fucked you up.

363
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,594
I can't taste nothin'.
My tongue is numb, man.

364
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,950
Why y'all sit and let her
do this shit?

365
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,913
[Scoffs]
It's your girl.

366
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,190
What's up
with her, man?

367
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,313
She mean as hell.
Man, I met D'wana
about three months ago, right?

368
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,876
She had a little pudge
in her stomach, but I ain't
pay no attention to it.

369
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,549
I thought it came from drinking
forties and shit, 'cause she
had a little beer on her breath.

370
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,752
Come to find out she's
six months pregnant, talkin'
about I'm the baby's dad.

371
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,270
- What?
- Yeah, yeah.

372
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,595
How you gonna be
the baby's daddy?
Hell, man.

373
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,517
You know she lyin'.

374
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,950
Man, I broke up with D'wana
two Fridays ago.

375
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,278
I got a restraining order
on her, and she don't care
about that or none of that shit.

376
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,550
What?
She got me fuckin' up.

377
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,672
Damn, I broke up with her
two months ago,
two Fridays ago,

378
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,510
and she still...
she don't care about no
restraining order or nothin'.

379
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,712
You all right with them
pants, man?
Man, get out of my business.

380
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,991
How you gonna have
a restraining order, man,
on your girl?

381
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,192
What's up with y'all, man?
Where you meet her?

382
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,471
I was on my way
back to the hood
to buy them twenties.

383
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,995
I mean, them tens.
They tens.

384
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,317
But I keep 'em clean. I was on
my way to buy them, and she had
a Carl's Jr. burger in her hand.

385
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,113
I was standin' there.
I wanted a piece of it
and I stopped.

386
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,151
We got to rappin',
and that's how it happened.

387
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,192
- It was the worst day
of my fuckin' life.
- Damn.

388
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,556
Psycho, huh?

389
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,069
She must be worse
than Left Eye from T.L.C.
or somethin'.

390
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,158
This fat bitch ain't burnin'.
That ain't the cold part.

391
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,353
She got a little sister named
Baby D'. I'm tellin' you,
this fat bitch get physical.

392
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,677
She sell dope, do hair
and baby-sit out the same house.

393
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,677
Police don't know
when to kick the door in.

394
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,916
I got a restraining order
on her fat ass too.
Wait, wait.

395
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,349
You got a restraining order
on a little girl
named Baby D'?

396
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,268
You don't know Baby D'.
That's why you lookin' at me,
'cause you don't know Baby D'.

397
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,597
Her fat ass be snorin'

[Breathing Heavily]

399
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,670
Fat little cupcakes and shit.

00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,870
all the new snacks
before they even
hit the street.

401
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,276
All the bootleg snacks,

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,190
Fat bitch.
Let me get ready
to go to work.

408
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,116
'Cause I'm a player, nigga.
I'm a pimp, and I don't
have to deal with this shit.

409
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,915
You got your shirt on
backwards, player.
Players fuck up.

410
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,635
Snatch the shit
off your head, man.
Don't
worry about what I'm doin'.

411
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,558
Why didn't y'all do nothin'
when the fat bitch
jumped on me?

412
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,593
Y'all a trip! I'm movin'.
I'm runnin' away from here.

413
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,638
Yo, we gotta pull over

[Debo]
Keep your mind

417
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,669

Close your mouth,

423
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,798
and say you have
an urgent message
from Mr. William Jones.

424
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,434
What urgent message?
The urgent message is,
"Drop everything.

425
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,357
Craig's in trouble.
Come quick."

426
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,756
I don't think that shit
gonna work.
Man, just do it.

427
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,474
I don't even know the number.
It's on the side
of the building, fool.

428
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,477
Just pick the phone up.

Get the fuck outta here!
What you doin', man?

457
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,192
This is the most ridiculous
thing I've ever seen

458
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,038
Go back in the truck.
What you doin'
outta this truck?

This ain't bad, right?
Yeah, it is.

Hell, yeah,

I'm so sorry about
what my brothers
did to you this morning.

767
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,597
They're... They're just assholes.
Oh, you don't have to
apologize for your brothers.

769
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,750
I wanted
to give you this.

770
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,678
If my brothers weren't
so overprotective, I'd have you
call the house,

771
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,995
but for now, just page me
when you get a chance.

You're not gonna catch me.

942
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,116
[Pinky]
Don't kill me.
Goddamn, don't kill me.

943
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,949
- [Sobbing]
- Craig, what you doin'?

944
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,230
- Nothin'.
- Day-Day.

945
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,193
[Day-Day] Huh?
Is this your cousin?

946
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:26,596
- Yeah, that's my cousin.
- Good. Then you fired.

947
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,790
Who, me?
Yeah, you.

948
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,956
- I'm fired?
- And Roach, you fired too.

949
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,036
You fired.
Why you gonna
fire me for, Pinky?

950
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,799
- [Pinky]
Shut up! Shut up!
- I saw you...

951
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,718
- You better keep
your goddamn mouth shut!
- Bobby Womack.

952
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,751
Oh, I heard that shit!
Say it again!
Say it again!

953
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,036
Shit.

954
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,276
And you lucky, nigga.
I was just fixin'
to get up in your ass.

955
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,755
Give me back
my motherfuckin' pistol.

956
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,269
- Get the fuck up
out of my store.
- That's bullshit!

957
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,870
Shut up!
Punk ass.

958
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,639
Tryin' to rob me.
Nigga, I'm Pinky.

959
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,153
Shit, that nigga had me scared,
but I held my own.
Fuck that.

960
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,234
Fat bitch is bustin'
my windows out
all the time.

961
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,118
I knew you shouldn't...
[Stammering]
When you goin' home?

962
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,037
[Craig's Voice]
D's sayin'.

963
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:18,472
In a strange way,
I feel responsible
for Day-Day gettin'fired.

964
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,319
If I wouldn't have
fought Pinky and gave
Day-Day that joint,

965
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,591
he'd still have
a job by now.

966
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,757
Roach too.
That's true.

967
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,836
Got to think of somethin'.

968
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,918
This fat bitch
bust my windows.
Soon as he shut the fuck up.

969
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:38,034
You ain't even help me.
You sit there and watched her
do the shit, Craig.

970
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,038
And you better quit
hangin' around black people.
You see how we live?

971
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,436
We live wild.
We live rough.
I'm tellin' you.

972
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,475
[Rap]

973
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,956

[Funk]

975
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,679
Damn, Daddy. I didn't know
you had titties.
[Muffled]

976
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,951
We got a...
a certified this

977
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,430
Yeah.

978
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,676
And I got

[Mumbles]

980
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,999
Oh, my head!
Daddy!

981
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,516
Mr. White Man,
tell me what happened.
What's up there?

982
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,791
Mister, I gotta go help my son.
Let me over.
Please, let me over.

983
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:40,515
I gotta help myself too.
I got a burning in my stomach.

984
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,598
Oh, my stomach hurts.
Oh, man!
[Siren Wailing]

985
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,836
Officer, please.
Don't just drive past me.

986
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,635
Officer!
Man, how long we gotta ride
in this stupid-ass van anyway?

987
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,591
Fuck, I don't know.
Shut up, man.
[Shouts]

988
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,915
- Raise your hand
if you wanna talk to me.
- Ow! Ow!

989
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,032
Man, what we gonna do?

990
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,549
I don't know yet.
Tsk.

991
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,036
I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm goin'home
and face the music.

992
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:06,197
My dad finds out
I got fired again, man,
he's gonna kick my ass.

993
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:09,551
- Sorry about today.
- Yeah, me too. Later.

994
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,158
[Grunts, Groans]

995
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,032
My board!

996
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,196
[Joker]
Get the board.
Get the board!

997
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,278
[People In Car Cheering,
Laughing]

998
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,119
My skateboard.

999
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:32,319
Let's play some quarters
and shit. And don't forget
the chips, esa.

1000
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,358
- What the fuck
you lookin' at, ese?
- Nothin'. I...

1001
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,477
Broke my board.

1002
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,556
It shouldn't have
been in the street.

1003
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,760
Take me to Judge Judy,
Puto. Let's go.

1004
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,519
Who the fuck
are those guys?
Let it go, man. Trust me.

1005
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,756
I ain't lettin' shit go, man.
They broke my skateboard!

1006
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,678
Let it go. Trust me.
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait. Look.

1007
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,871
You see that?
[Day-Day]
I ain't see nothin'.

1008
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,195
There must be money or somethin'
in that hydraulic pump.

1009
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,470
Yeah, air.

1010
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,637
It's somethin' better
than air. I could tell
how funny he act.

1011
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,799
Hey, Cheeco, how's it goin',
boy? Come here. Yeah, boy.
Come on. Ooh. Hey.

1012
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,434
- What are you doin'?
Get the fuck off me.
- How do you know for sure?

1013
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,790
- It could be any damn thing
in that pump.
- I don't know.

1014
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,229
It could be anything.
But I say we go over there
and take a look.

1015
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,920
I say you go by your damn self.
I'm not fuckin'
with them eses.

1016
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,190
Y'all go over there together
and tag team and do that shit.

1017
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:25,835
Now, all we need is
a big-ass pack of bologna.

1018
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,757
[Together]
"Bologna"?

1019
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:31,156
- Yeah, bologna.
- Want me to get some cheese
and a hot plate?

Is that a gas station
over there? Oh, here we go.
Yeah, that's a gas station.

Come on, move!
This fool
can't drive for shit!

1026
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:56,713
I guess I'm gonna have to kill
that little dad of his too
when I get through with Craig.

I hope the bathroom
is clean.

Oh. Oh. Oh.

I knew I shouldn't have
eaten all that hot sauce.

Can I get the key
to the bathroom?

1038

I don't wanna
buy no hubcap. Oh.

Hi. How are ya?
What are you doin' here?

I'm actually lookin' for
a new house out here because
I have to move out of the hood.

gettin' bad.
Yeah, Stan, I got to go.

that anybody go in there
for at least 35, 45 minutes.

Ooh, nice booty.

You like that, mi hija?
Oh, you know I do, papi.

Right over here!
You and me.
You and me.

1066
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,350
I'm nervous, man.
I got the B.G.s.

1067
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,358
What's the B.G. s?
The bubble guts.

1068
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,994
I'm nervous, and I'm about
to shit on myself.

Keep a tight ass, Day-Day.
Try to hold it in or somethin'.
Shut up.

I'm about to go home.

Look. Look.
If we don't go do this,

1073
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,030
you ain't gonna have
no home to go to.

1074
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:29,789
Now, all we gotta do is find out
where the little one
put that pump,

1075
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,956
take it and see
what's in it.

1076
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:35,755
Dang, you're in
the Kentucky Derby.
I'll take this off.

00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,635
I thought you were gonna
take me to see Mommy.

1080
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:50,309
Uh, as you can see,
I'm a little preoccupied
right now.

1081
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,237
I'll take you later.

1082
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:54,191
When? After you're
all drunk and loaded?

1083
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,754
I said I'll take
your stupid ass later,
all right?

1084
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,916
Get the fuck outta here.
You're ruining my company.

1086
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,910
What's this silver thing
right here?
What "silver thing"?

1087
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,037
Hey, we forgot
to count that shit.

1088
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,355
Get up.
[Grunts]

1089
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,313
Business first.
Hey, Baby Joker.

1090
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,510
Come on. Forgot about
the business, ese.

1091
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,437
[Sighs]
Oh!

1092
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:23,949
Now, Roach, I need you
to occupy that dog...

1093
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,196
long enough for me
and Day-Day to take a look.

1094
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:29,073
No, man. Me and dogs

to get away from them,
but they just followed us.

1253
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:12,237
Damn. I hate
to hear that.

1254
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:14,157
Can I get out
this window right here?

1255
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,669
I thought you came up here
to see me.

1256
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,995
I did. It's just,
you know...

1257
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,588
Well, what's the hurry?

1258
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:25,918
I got my cousin, Day-Day,
out here waitin' on me.
So what?

1259
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,837
Let's make him wait.

1260
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,675
Knock.
You want me to knock?

1261
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,597
Knock!

1262
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:39,874
You're actin'
like a little bitch
right now, man.

1263
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,991
They ain't gonna hear that.
The music's playin'.

1264
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:45,112
Excuse me, partner.
That was a fuckin'
ghetto knock I just did.

1265
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,754
I'll show you how to knock
on a door.
What you doin'? Stop.

1266
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:50,678
Yeah. Rub that shit.
[Banging On Door]

1267
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:53,917

[Banging Continues]
Fuckin' shit!

01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,113
Gotta do everything

1270
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,760
Ruining my flow.

1271
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:07,475
- Mmm, right there.
- Hey, you lover boys,
you hear that shit?

1272
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,068
Motherfucker,
you better stop.

1273
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,839
They gonna think
we the police in there.
It gets results.

1274
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,837
- What the fuck do you want?
- We came to borrow some sugar.

1275
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,391
Does this look like
a fuckin' 7-11 to you, homes?

1276
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,317
Do you see the red dot
on my forehead, my friend?

1277
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:26,159
Do you see an A. T.M.
in the corner
that doesn't work?

1278
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,874
Do you? No, you don't.
So fuck you, my friend.

1279
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,037
Get the fuck outta here,
Day-Day. You too, Slim Shady.

1280
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:35,789
No problem. We gone.
Hold on a second.

1281
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,832
Hey, man, you ran over
my skateboard.

1282
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,235
I don't appreciate that,
all right?

1283
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,351
Uh, that's that bullshit,
man. It ain't...

1284
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,477
I got your message.
Where's Craig?

1285
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,433
"Message"? I ain't sent you
no damn message.

1286
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:08,394
You didn't call the sandwich
joint with an urgent message?
Hell, no, Willie.

1287
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,317
You startin' to think
like a dog.

1288
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,510
You leave them fleas and ticks
suckin on your old-ass brain.

1289
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:16,633
Somebody sent me a message.
Where's Craig and Day-Day?
I don't know.

1290
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:18,557
Come on in.

1291
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:23,796
You know you got shit

01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:27,196
Hey, don't sit on that couch.
Put some paper down.

01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:30,471
Next time
page me first.
Okay, I'll do that.

1297
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,798
This is some bullshit.

01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,836

Nice to meet you, ladies.

This ain't The Love Connection,
homes. Tryin' to pick up
on our honeys or what, eh?

1308
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,354
You wanna go to the room
or something right now?

1309
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:21,631
I don't know about you two.
I don't know about
this sugar shit.

1310
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:25,116
'Cause I know black people got
a lot of sugar in their house.
So, I don't know, homes.

1311
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,071
You're making me sus...

1312
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,191
uh, sus...
Suspicious, eh?

It's makin' me think a lot,

Give me the weapon.

Are you gonna give me a ride
to see Mommy?

1321
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:02,837
Dang, you bug! Look,

No!
Shut up, stupid.
Just give me your car keys.

I'm not stupid.
You're stupid.
No, you're stupid.

1326
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,071
Don't call me stupid.
I'm sensitive.
Where's the car keys?

1327
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,760
- You're stupid.

Chickenhead. Don't be

If everything's cool,

1332
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:32,077
Aw, that's a deal. That's

Craig, where the hell you been?

1336
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:53,712
- Have y'all seen Day-Day?
- No. Thought he was with you.

I can't handle this, man.
You can't handle them?

Now, look.
Y'all take your asses

01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:16,998
but if you ain't back
in ten minutes, I'm callin' the
police and the insurance man.

1364

Yeah, we can be friends...
as soon as you tell me
where my money is.

1371
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:45,669
Money? Man, we came over here
to borrow some sugar from you
and some rolling papers.

1372
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:49,713
We wanted to get high.

Hey, maybe that other

Oh, thank you.

only thing I had was a stick.
