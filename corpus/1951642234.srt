1
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:48,757
Dawn had many phases
in her short life,

2
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,427
but her love of music
never changed...

3
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,890
...even when she was told
she had no real talent.

4
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:02,563
Last night, rummaging
in her closet, I found this tape,

5
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:07,067
a recording of a piece
for a school talent contest.

6
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,988
She lost in the first round.

7
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:16,243
Personally, I think
the judges made a mistake.

8
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,783
Mum!

9
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:41,620
It's OK. It's OK, honey.

10
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:46,834
Sh! It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

11
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,836
Sh!

12
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,922
I don't want to be like Dawn.

13
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:56,260
I don't want to be like her,
or end up like her.

14
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:59,805
Aviva, no. Sh!

15
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:04,142
Don't worry. You and Dawn
are completely different.

16
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,395
Really?

17
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:11,400
Your cousin was a troubled child -
a middle child.

18
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:16,280
Her parents didn't love her the way
your father and I love you.

19
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,866
Why not?
- I don't know.

20
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:22,202
Maybe if she hadn't grown obese.

21
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,330
If she'd gone to a dermatologist...

22
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,916
Is it true she never washed her hair?

23
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:33,755
Dawn was a very special person,
with very special needs.

24
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,177
Oh, God!

25
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:42,472
There's so much
I'd have done for her, if only...

26
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,933
Missy told me after the funeral

27
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:48,020
that Dawn was pregnant
from a date rape

28
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,607
and that's the real reason
she killed herself.

29
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:56,195
She hated the idea of bringing
another Dawn into the world,

30
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:59,489
and then she said
that I was just like Dawn.

31
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:03,827
Don't listen to what Missy says
just because she's popular.

32
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:08,832
I know, because if I were pregnant,
I would never kill myself.

33
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,210
That would be killing the baby.

34
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,838
You would talk to me first, right?

35
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:20,093
Yes, because I want to have
lots and lots of babies.

36
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:23,514
As many babies as possible,
because...

37
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:28,936
because that way,
I'll always have someone to love.

38
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,189
Oh, honey...

39
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,526
I love you so much.

40
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,531
So I'm really not like her?

41
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,242
No, Aviva.

42
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:48,622
You are the cutest bundle of love
in the whole wide world.

43
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:53,710
No matter what anyone says,
you'll always be you.

44
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:00,509
My baby.

45
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,761
You made it!

46
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,930
Great!
- Hi!

47
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:50,809
Come on in. This is the laundry room.
Bruce!

48
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,812
Great.
- Bruce, the Victors are here.

49
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:57,274
Anyway, this is it.
- How are you? Bruce.

50
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,693
Judah!
- I'm coming!

51
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:04,031
It only took us about three months.
We had to raise the ceiling.

52
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:07,451
You know, Bruce was getting
paint in his hair.

53
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,120
Christ, I was in the bathroom.
- OK.

54
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:12,372
Joyce, Steve-my son, Judah.

55
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,625
Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

56
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,085
And this is Aviva.
- Hey.

57
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,046
Hey.

58
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:23,675
Let's go out to the deck. The lake
is gorgeous. I'd love you to see it.

59
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,136
It's so beautiful.

60
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,520
What are you listening to?

61
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:38,106
A self-esteem lecture,
part of a series.

62
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,277
Judah, show Aviva the lake.

63
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,530
Will you shut the fuck up!

64
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,910
You want to come up?
- Oh, OK.

65
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:58,502
I'm trying to put together a feature,
a mix of genres.

66
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,172
I'm worried people will think
it's like Jackass.

67
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:04,925
It's nothing like it. It's original.

68
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,095
It's hard, though.

69
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:12,224
In the beginning, nobody
believes in you or wants to help.

70
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:16,311
It's hard getting someone
to be in it. No one makes an effort.

71
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:23,318
I asked my mum, she said no.
My dad, he's too busy.

72
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,571
People are unreliable.

73
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,116
They have no faith.

74
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:38,750
I know.

75
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,343
Is that you?
- Yeah.

76
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:52,389
You were so cute.
- Yeah.

77
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,350
Too bad you had to grow up.

78
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,187
Yeah, I know.

79
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,982
I was so happy then,
only I didn't know it.

80
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,528
Maybe you're happy now.
You just don't know it.

81
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:15,245
<i>Oh, yes.! </i></i>

82
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:18,248
<i>Oh, Ron.! Ron.! </i></i>

83
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:23,462
<i>Ron Gerard.! Harder.! Harder.! Harder.! </i></i>

84
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,839
<i>Yes.! Oh, Ron.! </i></i>

85
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:28,467
That guy...
- Yeah?

86
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:32,638
He lives nearby. I'm going to see
if he'll do a cameo in my feature.

87
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,433
I need a professional actor
for marketing purposes.

88
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:38,685
But it'll be family rated.

89
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:44,233
<i>Touch my titties.! It feels</i>
<i>so good.! That's right, touch them.! </i></i>

90
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,621
Please take it off.

91
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,502
Let's get under the covers.
- OK.

92
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,560
Do you think about sex a lot?

93
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:24,314
I don't know. I guess.

94
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:32,322
I never think about it.
I just think about having a baby.

95
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:35,659
Why?

96
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:41,331
I don't know. They're cute.
I want one.

97
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:47,963
OK, then. Are you ready?

98
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,343
Uh-huh.

99
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:56,889
OK. Here goes.

100
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,729
I thought you'd done this before.

101
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,691
I did. You should have
moved your hips more.

102
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,819
Huh?
- Just forget it.

103
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,205
Oh. Is that it, then?

104
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:08,502
What? Do you want a tissue?
Is that what you mean?

105
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:14,341
Could you try it again,
like Ron Gerard?

106
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,593
Right now?
- Yeah.

107
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:18,846
I don't know.

108
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:47,207
Aviva, are you OK?

109
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,811
What?

110
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:30,125
Who did this to you?
Who the fuck did this to you?

111
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:34,379
It was that Wallace boy!
That ugly, fat little bastard!

112
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,800
Aviva, did he rape you?

113
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,664
He's going to pay!

114
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:11,959
That fucking shitface!
He'll pay big time!

115
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,795
What will you do?
Talk to his parents?

116
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:19,299
Fucking sue? She doesn't
need any more humiliation.

117
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:22,386
We'll find a doctor
and that'll be that.

118
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:59,173
Honey, can we talk for a bit now?
- Oh, OK.

119
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:04,094
I'm sorry I was so upset
at you before.

120
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:11,643
It wasn't your fault and I apologise.

121
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:16,690
It's just... It was such a shock.

122
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:22,696
I want you to know that
your father and I stand behind you.

123
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:27,242
We're not going to let anyone
find out about this.

124
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:32,998
We don't want you any more hurt
than you already have been.

125
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,919
And we'll find a doctor

126
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:41,507
who'll be able to take care
of everything for you.

127
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,468
I won't let your life
be ruined by this.

128
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:52,059
I'm keeping it.
- Oh, honey.

129
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,770
It's mine.

130
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,649
I know. I know this is difficult.

131
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:03,737
But really,
you're still just a child.

132
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:10,577
There's so much
you have to live for and experience.

133
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:15,791
You don't want to be
tied down by... by a baby.

134
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:20,921
You have a future,
college, boyfriends...

135
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,173
I won't have any boyfriends!

136
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:27,719
Of course you'll have boyfriends.
- I don't want any boyfriends!

137
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,056
What do you mean?
- I mean I don't want any!

138
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:38,397
Are you trying
to tell me something? Aviva?

139
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:42,109
It's OK. You can talk to me.

140
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,446
Are you a...
- No!

141
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:50,617
Aviva, it's OK. It's OK if you are.

142
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:54,454
There's nothing to feel bad about.

143
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:58,959
You know that I'll always
accept you, no matter what.

144
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:08,427
You know that you're my one and only.

145
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:14,391
My sweetie-pie.

146
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:20,898
You know I'm on your side.

147
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:29,907
But really...

148
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:36,997
Be reasonable.
The baby has to go.

149
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:42,002
What happens
if it turns out deformed?

150
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:47,257
If it's missing a leg or an arm
or a nose or an eye?

151
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:51,386
If it's brain-damaged
or mentally retarded?

152
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:56,600
Children of very young mothers often
turn out that way and then what?

153
00:16:56,808 --> 00:17:00,437
Then you're stuck.
Your life is ruined forever!

154
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:03,941
You end up on food stamps, alone!

155
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:08,779
But it's my baby!
- But it's not a baby! Not yet!

156
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:13,951
Really, it's just...
It's like it's just a tumour!

157
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,174
I'm keeping it.

158
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,517
No, you're not.

159
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,019
Yes, I am.

160
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:48,986
Then you find another home.
- You can't take my baby away!

161
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:52,114
Too late. I already made
the appointment.

162
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:09,923
Honey, I know you're upset.
I spoke with your mum.

163
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:13,635
I understand. She's very upset also.

164
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:19,433
But could you please open the door
so just the two of us can talk?

165
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,685
Honey?

166
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,353
Honey, please.

167
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:29,484
You have to come
out of there sooner or later.

168
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,778
Can't stay in there forever.

169
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:35,574
You have to eat sometime,
go to the bathroom.

170
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:39,244
Honey, you've been
locked in there too long,

171
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:43,916
and I'm afraid if you don't open up,
I'll have to force it open.

172
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:47,836
Please, honey.
Please don't make me force it open.

173
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,968
You're not making
this easy for either of us,

174
00:18:55,177 --> 00:19:00,140
so just open the door and
we can discuss this like adults, OK?

175
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:05,854
Open up! I'm not kidding around!
Open the goddamn door!

176
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:08,148
No!

177
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:15,072
We'll take care
of it tomorrow.

178
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,574
She's not coming out.

179
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:21,662
She's got no choice.
Come on, let's go to bed.

180
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:28,794
Baby, I know how hard
this all has been.

181
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,841
And I'm so sorry, really.

182
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:42,933
But now I'll tell you something
that I've never told you before,

183
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:46,270
but I think
you're old enough now, so...

184
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:55,487
Well, when you were just
a little girl, about three or four...

185
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,074
...I was pregnant.

186
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:03,620
And at first I was all happy
and excited.

187
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:07,749
"A new friend for you," I thought.
"A baby brother."

188
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:11,837
I thought I'd call him Henry
after my grandfather Henrik,

189
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,089
who never cared about money.

190
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:21,263
But, well, then your father and I
had a long talk,

191
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:22,973
and I began to realise

192
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:26,059
there were other things
to think about.

193
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:30,272
Your father was out of work.
My paintings weren't selling.

194
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,276
I was blocked.
I started smoking again.

195
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:37,779
There were bills,
a mortgage, a lawsuit.

196
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,700
If I'd had another child...

197
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:46,580
...I wouldn't have been able
to give you all that I have.

198
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:54,338
All the time we spend together,
just you and me,

199
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:58,217
and the little treats
your father and I pick up for you -

200
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:01,720
the 'N Sync tickets, the Gap account,

201
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:04,640
hand-packed quarts
of Ben and Jerry's.

202
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,727
We couldn't have afforded it.

203
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:13,899
It would have been a real strain
and we all would have been miserable.

204
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:21,782
I admit I was a little nervous
about the whole idea.

205
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:26,411
I was scared, just like you.

206
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:34,545
But it was the right choice,
and it was my choice.

207
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:40,050
So I grit my teeth,
thought of the future,

208
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:43,345
and once I came out
of that doctor's office,

209
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:49,726
well, honey, let me tell you,
I have never felt so relieved,

210
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:55,566
so good in all my life, as I did
after I took care of little Henry.

211
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:59,403
And I have never regretted it since.

212
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:02,573
Honey...

213
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:06,535
...you've got to be brave and do it.

214
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:11,248
Just like Mum.

215
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:16,503
Please.

216
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,174
Do it for me.

217
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:03,509
Shit. Nutcases.

218
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:07,471
Ignore them.

219
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:29,117
Don't do it! Don't do it!

220
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:31,537
Don't do it! Don't do it!

221
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:34,998
Don't do it! Don't do it!
Don't do it!

222
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:38,460
Don't do it! Don't do it!

223
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:46,969
Everything will be alright.

224
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:51,598
Doctor Fleischer's the best.

225
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:55,310
Very gentle.

226
00:23:57,271 --> 00:23:59,565
Just like he was with me.

227
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:07,030
My baby girl.

228
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:39,980
Dr Fleischer, is she OK?

229
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:45,444
I'm sorry.
There was extreme haemorrhaging.

230
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:48,280
I... I don't...

231
00:24:50,491 --> 00:24:53,243
You mean that there's no...

232
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:59,416
In rare cases,
with very young...

233
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:03,086
the uterus...
the wall of the uterus can tear...

234
00:25:03,295 --> 00:25:07,466
Joyce?
Joyce, what's happened?

235
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:11,595
We had to perform a hysterectomy.

236
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:15,849
But I thought...

237
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:18,227
I'm sorry.

238
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:20,604
God! No! No!

239
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:25,192
I'll never have any grandchildren!

240
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,444
Oh, my God!

241
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:36,912
Hey there, sweetie.

242
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:42,584
Is it all over?

243
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:48,382
Yes, and you're all OK.

244
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,634
100% OK.

245
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:53,762
Everything's OK.

246
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:56,723
Dr Fleischer said
good as new.

247
00:25:58,475 --> 00:26:01,144
Really?
- Mm-hmm.

248
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:04,439
That's right, honey.

249
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:08,360
Good...

250
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,446
Mum?

251
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:17,161
Yes, sweetie?

252
00:26:19,163 --> 00:26:21,373
Was it a boy or a girl?

253
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:28,505
It doesn't matter.

254
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:31,300
But I want to know.
- No, you don't.

255
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:35,262
Tell me...

256
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:38,348
...please.

257
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:52,988
It was a girl.

258
00:27:06,168 --> 00:27:08,212
Henrietta.

259
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,864
Do you need a lift?

260
00:28:19,158 --> 00:28:22,035
I'll take you home.
- I'm not going home.

261
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:25,330
Yeah, right.

262
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:29,501
You'd rather be raped
by a serial killer? Go on, get in.

263
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,473
Do you know your name's a palindrome?

264
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:47,060
What's that?

265
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:51,565
A word. Spell it backwards
or forwards and it stays the same.

266
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:55,777
It never changes. Like Anna, or Ulu.

267
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:58,906
Or "Sums are not set
as a test on Erasmus."

268
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:01,992
I've got a file of them on my G4.

269
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:05,913
Please don't take me home.

270
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:22,554
Can you wait for five minutes?
I must pick up some zip disks.

271
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:24,389
OK.

272
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:39,214
Take me please now
Help me please

273
00:30:39,423 --> 00:30:44,928
Get me please
Far, far away

274
00:30:46,972 --> 00:30:52,519
To a place
Any place, any place

275
00:30:52,728 --> 00:30:56,231
I'm far away

276
00:30:58,358 --> 00:31:01,945
Got to find some
Need to find

277
00:31:02,154 --> 00:31:07,576
Better find some other way...

278
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:20,297
Hey, you want to play Geography?

279
00:32:23,694 --> 00:32:28,031
Can you still get pregnant
when it goes in there?

280
00:32:48,969 --> 00:32:51,180
What's your name?

281
00:32:53,932 --> 00:32:55,976
Joe. You?

282
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,564
I'm... I'm Henrietta.

283
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:03,567
Hello, Henrietta.

284
00:33:03,817 --> 00:33:05,444
Hello, Joe.

285
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:09,490
Joe...

286
00:33:10,449 --> 00:33:12,784
I had a good time last night.

287
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:18,248
I mean, I never knew
it was so beautiful.

288
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:22,628
Me, too.

289
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:25,964
Joe...

290
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:27,799
Yeah?

291
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:32,596
Do you think next time
you could try coming inside me?

292
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:35,557
I mean, the regular way?

293
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:40,103
Sure. Yeah, I can do that.

294
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:45,943
I'll meet you in the coffee shop.

295
00:37:11,356 --> 00:37:12,774
Hello?

296
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,116
Hello.

297
00:37:23,118 --> 00:37:25,162
Are you OK?

298
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:33,003
Yeah.

299
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:35,672
What are you doing here?

300
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,344
I got lost.

301
00:37:41,386 --> 00:37:44,097
Huh... What's your name?

302
00:37:48,644 --> 00:37:50,270
Henrietta.

303
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:56,610
Hi, Henrietta. I'm Peter Paul.
Nice to meet you.

304
00:37:58,946 --> 00:38:00,989
Nice to meet you, too.

305
00:38:02,282 --> 00:38:03,909
Want some Nerds?

306
00:38:26,515 --> 00:38:28,141
Thank you.

307
00:38:33,772 --> 00:38:37,734
Would you like to come with me?
I'll take you to my house.

308
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:43,824
OK.
- Here, take my hand.

309
00:38:50,873 --> 00:38:53,750
Come on. We're almost there.

310
00:39:08,307 --> 00:39:10,434
Hi, Trixie. Hi, Barbara.

311
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:13,395
Hi, Peter Paul.
- Who's your new friend?

312
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:16,023
Henrietta. She was by the brook.

313
00:39:16,273 --> 00:39:18,233
Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

314
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:22,905
Hi. Nice to meet you, too.
- Need any help?

315
00:39:23,155 --> 00:39:26,700
We're OK. Take Henrietta inside
to Mama Sunshine.

316
00:39:27,493 --> 00:39:31,330
She looks a little tired.
- OK, we'll see you later.

317
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:36,877
Hey, Shazaam.
- Hey, Double P.

318
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:40,756
How's it going? Catch any fish?
- You bet I did.

319
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:56,480
What's the matter?
Don't you worry about a thing.

320
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:58,732
Everyone loves Mama Sunshine.

321
00:40:02,152 --> 00:40:05,697
Mama Sunshine!
- Peter Paul, is that you?

322
00:40:05,906 --> 00:40:09,868
Look, I have a new friend.
Her name is Henrietta.

323
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:13,288
Hi, Henrietta.
Can I get you something to eat?

324
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:16,375
You look like you need
some home cooking.

325
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:22,130
That would be very nice, but...
- No 'but-but's here, Henrietta.

326
00:40:22,381 --> 00:40:27,219
Jesus tears!
- Can I please have a glass of Evian?

327
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:31,598
We don't drink fancy delancey here.
How about some cola?

328
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:34,101
OK. Thank you.

329
00:40:34,893 --> 00:40:38,897
Here, try one. She makes
the best Jesus tears in the state!

330
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:03,130
Hi, there.

331
00:41:05,966 --> 00:41:07,384
Hi.

332
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:11,305
Feeling better?

333
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:14,850
Where am I?
- At the Sunshine's.

334
00:41:15,058 --> 00:41:17,603
You want to sit up
and have some tea?

335
00:41:24,234 --> 00:41:26,987
Don't worry.
I put your stuff in the wash.

336
00:41:27,237 --> 00:41:30,991
I have fresh clothes for when
you feel better tomorrow

337
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,702
laid out there, all nice and clean.

338
00:41:34,995 --> 00:41:36,413
Thank you.

339
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:39,791
Your parents must be
worried about you.

340
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:50,886
They're not.
- How can you say such a thing?

341
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,057
You know, when you were
all sleepy-bye,

342
00:41:55,265 --> 00:41:58,435
our neighbour Dr Dan
came by and examined you.

343
00:41:58,644 --> 00:42:01,230
He said you've had some adventures.

344
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:03,815
What do you mean? Who's Dr Dan?

345
00:42:04,066 --> 00:42:08,195
Don't worry. He's an old
family friend and a very fine doctor.

346
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:11,323
You'd like Dr Dan. He's the nicest!

347
00:42:11,573 --> 00:42:14,409
Everything will be fine.

348
00:42:14,618 --> 00:42:17,371
He said you're a little dehydrated.

349
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:21,625
That means you must drink
lots of liquids, so drink the tea!

350
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:23,919
Right.

351
00:42:28,674 --> 00:42:30,717
Now...

352
00:42:31,677 --> 00:42:34,388
you want to tell me
about what happened?

353
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:36,682
Did you run away from home?

354
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:42,479
Open your heart.
This is a house of love and faith.

355
00:42:42,688 --> 00:42:45,899
The Lord is merciful.
- The Lord?

356
00:42:47,276 --> 00:42:48,902
Jesus Christ.

357
00:42:50,195 --> 00:42:52,239
Please.

358
00:43:00,581 --> 00:43:02,624
My parents are dead.

359
00:43:04,626 --> 00:43:08,255
They died in
the September 11th attacks.

360
00:43:08,505 --> 00:43:11,842
Vaporised. Burned to ashes.

361
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:18,015
Their bodies never recovered.
I loved them very much.

362
00:43:18,223 --> 00:43:21,351
It's OK. Go on.

363
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,980
So then, my grandmother
took care of me for a while.

364
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:31,028
She was very loving
and she liked giving me presents.

365
00:43:31,236 --> 00:43:35,365
She surprised me with one
every day after school.

366
00:43:36,158 --> 00:43:38,202
But then she died.

367
00:43:41,246 --> 00:43:43,290
Brain cancer.

368
00:43:46,502 --> 00:43:50,923
I miss her so much.
- Here.

369
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:58,597
Thank you.

370
00:44:00,891 --> 00:44:06,271
So then I had no other relatives,
so they put me in a foster home.

371
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:10,025
It was horrible.

372
00:44:10,234 --> 00:44:14,321
The father, he was an alcoholic,
and he tried to...

373
00:44:16,448 --> 00:44:18,992
I can't talk any more!

374
00:44:19,827 --> 00:44:23,539
Hush, don't cry. Oh, honey!

375
00:44:28,836 --> 00:44:33,340
Mama Sunshine, can she stay with us?
Can she, Mama Sunshine?

376
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,634
Can she, please?

377
00:44:36,593 --> 00:44:39,471
Could I? Just for a little while.

378
00:44:41,139 --> 00:44:43,600
I'm so scared of going back.

379
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:45,894
Of course, sweetie, of course.

380
00:44:46,144 --> 00:44:49,565
Mama Sunshine could never
turn away a needy child.

381
00:44:49,815 --> 00:44:52,151
It's true.

382
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:56,738
Still, I have to discuss it
with the man of the house.

383
00:44:56,947 --> 00:44:59,241
But don't you worry.

384
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:05,122
I can hear God in your little heart.
Jesus cares.

385
00:45:07,166 --> 00:45:11,503
Now, you drink up the rest of
this tea and you go back to sleep.

386
00:45:11,712 --> 00:45:13,881
We'll see you bright and early, OK?

387
00:45:14,506 --> 00:45:16,550
Thank you, Mama Sunshine.

388
00:45:26,226 --> 00:45:28,270
Sweet dreams.

389
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:37,613
Rise and shine! Rise and shine!

390
00:45:45,537 --> 00:45:48,499
Good morning, Henrietta.
- Good morning.

391
00:45:48,707 --> 00:45:51,168
Good morning!

392
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:54,713
Oh, well, don't you look nice today?

393
00:45:54,922 --> 00:46:00,427
Come here and sit down. I've got
a nice cosy corner seat for you.

394
00:46:00,636 --> 00:46:02,721
I'll introduce you to everybody,

395
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:06,642
starting with the head
of the household, my husband Bo.

396
00:46:06,892 --> 00:46:11,772
That's right. You just call me Bo.
- And I'm Barbara. Remember me?

397
00:46:12,022 --> 00:46:14,107
She's blind.
- Hush now!

398
00:46:14,358 --> 00:46:16,193
Jiminy here.
- I'm Crystal.

399
00:46:16,401 --> 00:46:18,987
I'm Skippy, like the peanut butter!

400
00:46:21,782 --> 00:46:26,328
And my name's Ali.
- He was a heathen. He's been saved.

401
00:46:26,578 --> 00:46:29,373
Peter Paul!
- You know me, I'm Shazaam.

402
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:31,542
And I'm Trixie, remember?

403
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:34,795
I'm Ellen, but everyone here
calls me 'EII'.

404
00:46:35,045 --> 00:46:37,631
For leukaemia.
- Now, Peter Paul!

405
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:40,634
Ell is in remission, thank the Lord.

406
00:46:40,884 --> 00:46:46,139
And I'm Carlito. I'm epileptic.
- Oh you! You're just fine.

407
00:46:47,057 --> 00:46:49,852
He's under medication, too.

408
00:46:51,353 --> 00:46:52,980
And that's Cuddles!

409
00:46:56,525 --> 00:46:58,652
And you, forgive me, you're...

410
00:46:58,902 --> 00:47:01,947
Henrietta.
- Welcome, Henrietta.

411
00:47:02,197 --> 00:47:05,826
Welcome to the family.
- Welcome, Henrietta!

412
00:47:06,743 --> 00:47:11,456
Thank you.
Thank you for having me. I...

413
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:16,628
Ahh!
- Ahh!

414
00:47:16,837 --> 00:47:20,132
Well, I think it's about time
we all say grace.

415
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:34,688
Bless us, O Lord, and these gifts,
which we receive

416
00:47:34,938 --> 00:47:38,233
from thy bounty,
through Christ our Lord.

417
00:47:38,859 --> 00:47:41,069
Amen.
- Amen.

418
00:47:41,945 --> 00:47:44,615
We believe in
a healthy start to a day.

419
00:47:44,865 --> 00:47:47,075
Pass the freedom toast, please.

420
00:47:47,326 --> 00:47:50,496
The bacon is good today.
- It's fat and greasy!

421
00:47:50,746 --> 00:47:53,332
Barbara helped.
- I watched the flame.

422
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:57,753
You did more than that.
You cut open the package by yourself.

423
00:47:58,003 --> 00:48:00,964
I guess that's true.

424
00:48:01,173 --> 00:48:05,719
Henrietta, tell us about yourself.
You like cooking or sewing?

425
00:48:06,553 --> 00:48:10,015
I've never really cooked before.
- Never cooked?

426
00:48:10,265 --> 00:48:13,227
We take turns with everything.
- Teamwork!

427
00:48:13,477 --> 00:48:16,396
We all learn.
- You never learned to cook?

428
00:48:16,647 --> 00:48:18,607
Not even to microwave?

429
00:48:18,857 --> 00:48:22,528
My mum didn't believe
in microwaves. She was organic.

430
00:48:22,736 --> 00:48:24,780
That's OK, honey.

431
00:48:24,988 --> 00:48:28,033
With Jesus's help,
you'll learn fast here.

432
00:48:28,283 --> 00:48:33,121
I can teach you how to microwave.
- Last time, you almost blew us up!

433
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:40,754
You know, it's all thanks to Jesus
that we could save all these lives.

434
00:48:41,463 --> 00:48:44,007
Each one here has a story,
you know that?

435
00:48:44,258 --> 00:48:49,388
Every little one of us, it's true.
Barbara, why don't you share yours?

436
00:48:49,596 --> 00:48:52,766
Is Henrietta going to
join our singing group?

437
00:48:53,016 --> 00:48:58,272
Not now, Carlito. Let's listen
to Barbara first. Go on, honey.

438
00:48:58,522 --> 00:49:02,651
Well, my mother
was a drug addict, living in sin.

439
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,903
She didn't believe in God.

440
00:49:05,112 --> 00:49:07,990
When she got pregnant,
she took more drugs.

441
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:13,787
I was born blind as a result of
the drugs, but my mother didn't care.

442
00:49:14,037 --> 00:49:16,331
She didn't want me from the start.

443
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:21,753
She even tried to kill me inside her
with a coat hanger, but I survived.

444
00:49:21,962 --> 00:49:26,466
She was so angry, she never spoke
to me for my first three years.

445
00:49:26,717 --> 00:49:31,805
She just hit me and beat me
and cursed me every day.

446
00:49:32,055 --> 00:49:35,809
I don't remember any of this,
but this is what I found out

447
00:49:36,018 --> 00:49:38,812
when she overdosed
choking on her vomit.

448
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:43,942
I was sent to institutions
and had psychological evaluations.

449
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:46,195
But I wouldn't speak,

450
00:49:46,403 --> 00:49:50,657
until one day, Bo and Mama Sunshine
came to help a child in need.

451
00:49:50,908 --> 00:49:54,369
They introduced me
to the Saviour, Jesus Christ.

452
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:57,831
They saved me from perdition.
Jesus saved me.

453
00:49:58,081 --> 00:50:00,125
Amen.

454
00:50:00,334 --> 00:50:03,212
Thanks, Barbara.
- Please pass the syrup.

455
00:50:05,088 --> 00:50:07,591
Oh, Peter Paul, you're so nice.

456
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:13,555
And your family, they're all so nice.
It makes me sad. I mean...

457
00:50:13,764 --> 00:50:17,601
Don't be, Henrietta,
because what's mine is yours.

458
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:20,354
You're a member of this family, too.

459
00:50:20,562 --> 00:50:24,608
Come on, I've still got some time
before music practice.

460
00:50:24,817 --> 00:50:26,860
Let me show you something.

461
00:50:39,373 --> 00:50:42,751
Gee, that place looks kind of scary.

462
00:50:43,418 --> 00:50:45,587
You think anybody lives there?

463
00:50:47,047 --> 00:50:51,051
That's our neighbour Earl's house.
It's not scary at all.

464
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:54,847
Earl lives alone. He moved here
just a few years ago.

465
00:50:55,055 --> 00:50:58,892
He was arrested in Wyoming once
for something terrible,

466
00:50:59,142 --> 00:51:02,896
but he's paid his debt to society
and has been reborn.

467
00:51:03,105 --> 00:51:07,359
Now, he's the nicest guy you can
imagine. You want to go say hi?

468
00:51:08,652 --> 00:51:12,531
Maybe later. Let's keep walking.
- OK.

469
00:51:16,034 --> 00:51:18,912
Peter Paul?
- Yes, Henrietta?

470
00:51:19,121 --> 00:51:22,875
I was wondering,
after meeting your family and all...

471
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:25,878
Well, do you have,
like, a disability?

472
00:51:26,086 --> 00:51:28,130
Oh, me? I'm fine.

473
00:51:28,338 --> 00:51:32,467
I just have to clean the mucus
out of my lungs before I go to bed.

474
00:51:34,678 --> 00:51:37,764
Hey! See this?
- Yeah.

475
00:51:37,973 --> 00:51:42,102
Smells, doesn't it?
- Uh-huh.

476
00:51:42,311 --> 00:51:44,646
It's not just a regular garbage heap.

477
00:51:44,855 --> 00:51:47,816
This is where they throw out
unborn babies.

478
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:53,238
Every so often, a truck from
some baby killers dumps this stuff.

479
00:51:53,489 --> 00:51:58,494
If you look, you might find some
dead babies wrapped up in plastic.

480
00:52:00,454 --> 00:52:04,666
Mama Sunshine comes here
once a week looking for them.

481
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:09,379
She gives them a proper Christian
burial so they don't fry in Hell.

482
00:52:13,008 --> 00:52:15,052
Hey, look. There's one!

483
00:52:20,474 --> 00:52:23,810
I'm sorry, Henrietta!
I didn't mean to upset you.

484
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:26,980
I just thought you wanted to see.

485
00:52:28,524 --> 00:52:30,359
I'm sorry.

486
00:52:30,567 --> 00:52:33,987
It's OK. I should have known better.

487
00:52:34,196 --> 00:52:36,323
Most girls don't really like it here.

488
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:41,495
I just was thinking about
what Jesus said in the Bible.

489
00:52:41,703 --> 00:52:46,500
"Fear not... It is your Father's good
pleasure to give you the Kingdom."

490
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:48,544
Luke 12, verse 32.

491
00:52:49,545 --> 00:52:53,507
Come, let's get down
on our knees and pray.

492
00:53:03,517 --> 00:53:07,479
Now repeat after me - "Lord Jesus".

493
00:53:07,688 --> 00:53:09,314
Lord Jesus.

494
00:53:09,523 --> 00:53:14,278
Take care of the unborn babies.
Make sure they're happy in Heaven.

495
00:53:14,486 --> 00:53:17,364
Even those
that aren't in plastic bags.

496
00:53:17,573 --> 00:53:22,619
Even the ones that were strangled,
suffocated, drowned or incinerated.

497
00:53:22,828 --> 00:53:26,790
Even the ones whose bodies
were pulled apart limb by limb -

498
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:29,501
head cut off, eyes plucked out.

499
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:32,588
Even the ones
who had no fingers or toes,

500
00:53:32,796 --> 00:53:36,175
missing ears and noses,
no brain or heart.

501
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:39,094
Amen.
- Amen.

502
00:53:54,234 --> 00:53:57,946
Nobody else
Could ever love me this way

503
00:53:58,614 --> 00:54:02,826
Nobody, Jesus, but you
Ain't nobody

504
00:54:03,076 --> 00:54:06,997
Nobody else
Could ever get me to feel

505
00:54:07,206 --> 00:54:11,251
The way that you always do
Hey, hey, yeah

506
00:54:11,877 --> 00:54:15,547
We're going to Heaven
And we're so excited

507
00:54:15,797 --> 00:54:20,219
Cos there's a party
And we're all invited

508
00:54:20,427 --> 00:54:23,347
Nobody else
Could ever love me this way

509
00:54:23,597 --> 00:54:25,098
Nobody

510
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:29,186
Nobody, Jesus, but you

511
00:54:29,436 --> 00:54:33,023
Hallelujah

512
00:54:33,232 --> 00:54:35,859
We praise your name

513
00:54:36,109 --> 00:54:39,947
And all of the things that you do
Sweet, sweet Jesus

514
00:54:40,155 --> 00:54:44,618
Hallelujah, we praise your name

515
00:54:44,868 --> 00:54:47,704
Nobody, Jesus, but you!

516
00:54:49,915 --> 00:54:54,711
Wow! You guys are great.
You're all so talented.

517
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,714
You should go on MTV.
- Thanks.

518
00:54:57,923 --> 00:55:01,677
We do gospel tours every spring.
- Want to hear our CD?

519
00:55:01,927 --> 00:55:04,304
We were on The 700 Club.
- Twice.

520
00:55:04,555 --> 00:55:06,223
Almost.

521
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:10,978
Remember we are celebrating Jesus,
not profiting from Him.

522
00:55:11,228 --> 00:55:14,064
Do you want to join the group?
- Could I?

523
00:55:14,314 --> 00:55:15,899
Sure!

524
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:19,653
What would I do?
I don't play any instruments.

525
00:55:19,903 --> 00:55:23,866
You can join in on
the Hallelujah chorus. I'll show you.

526
00:55:24,783 --> 00:55:29,872
Go on, sweetie.
- Gee, thanks, but where should I go?

527
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,749
You just stand here,
right next to me.

528
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,043
Shazaam, give us a beat!

529
00:55:35,252 --> 00:55:37,754
One, two, three!

530
00:55:38,297 --> 00:55:41,216
Nobody else
Could ever love me this way

531
00:55:42,676 --> 00:55:44,803
Nobody, Jesus, but you...

532
00:56:04,948 --> 00:56:07,868
Peter Paul, treatment!
- Sorry.

533
00:56:08,076 --> 00:56:11,121
Henrietta, can you help me
with the folding?

534
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:13,165
Sure, Mama Sunshine.

535
00:56:13,582 --> 00:56:15,626
"Sunshine Sin"?

536
00:56:15,834 --> 00:56:19,671
"Sunshine Singers"!
- Oh, thank goodness!

537
00:56:23,425 --> 00:56:25,260
I hate to bother you, honey.

538
00:56:25,469 --> 00:56:29,598
I've got so much ironing,
and I wanted to talk to you, too.

539
00:56:29,806 --> 00:56:31,850
You've been so busy today.

540
00:56:33,727 --> 00:56:37,022
Are you feeling comfortable here?
- Sure.

541
00:56:37,231 --> 00:56:40,400
I know it's your first day.
- I'm comfortable.

542
00:56:40,609 --> 00:56:45,030
It's important to feel comfortable.
You've been through so much.

543
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:47,950
Is there something...
- No. It's just...

544
00:56:48,158 --> 00:56:51,203
You don't want me
in the Sunshine Singers.

545
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:56,208
Henrietta, of course I'd love you
to be a Sunshine Singer.

546
00:56:57,042 --> 00:57:01,797
But I was just a little concerned,
because, well...

547
00:57:03,841 --> 00:57:06,760
Peter Paul told me
where he took you today.

548
00:57:06,969 --> 00:57:09,555
It was a terrible mistake.

549
00:57:09,805 --> 00:57:13,141
He shouldn't have shown you
without telling me.

550
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:16,311
If it weren't for his... condition,
I'd...

551
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,317
Oh, Henrietta,

552
00:57:22,526 --> 00:57:25,737
there are evil things
out there in the world...

553
00:57:27,156 --> 00:57:29,700
...and you're such an innocent...

554
00:57:31,285 --> 00:57:34,788
...so pure and untarnished,
like a little angel.

555
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:40,961
Well, I hope you can forgive us,
forgive me.

556
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:45,132
I'd just go to pieces
if you had nightmares now,

557
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:48,677
or decided to leave us,
run away so soon.

558
00:57:49,803 --> 00:57:53,515
Last year, our special daughter
Nainika ran away,

559
00:57:53,724 --> 00:57:58,103
and... she didn't even have any legs.

560
00:58:00,689 --> 00:58:04,401
She wanted to return
to her birthplace in India.

561
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:10,032
Poor child. She didn't even make it
as far as India, Tennessee.

562
00:58:13,619 --> 00:58:15,662
I was a child runaway.

563
00:58:15,871 --> 00:58:17,915
That's why children

564
00:58:18,123 --> 00:58:22,211
are just... everything to me.

565
00:58:24,046 --> 00:58:26,089
All God's children.

566
00:58:27,049 --> 00:58:30,844
And so long as I'm here,
I'll do whatever it takes,

567
00:58:31,053 --> 00:58:33,138
come what may, to protect them.

568
00:58:36,058 --> 00:58:39,770
Of course, I'll understand
if you feel you have to leave.

569
00:58:40,479 --> 00:58:43,607
It's all my fault.
- Mama Sunshine, don't cry.

570
00:58:53,492 --> 00:58:55,536
I pledge allegiance

571
00:58:55,744 --> 00:58:58,580
to the flag of
the United States of America

572
00:58:58,789 --> 00:59:03,126
and to the republic for which
it stands, one nation, under God,

573
00:59:03,335 --> 00:59:07,923
indivisible, with liberty and justice
for all... born and unborn.

574
00:59:09,716 --> 00:59:13,554
You've got to fight
For the children

575
00:59:13,762 --> 00:59:17,182
You know they would fight for you

576
00:59:18,141 --> 00:59:22,521
Every baby has a right to be born

577
00:59:22,729 --> 00:59:27,067
Listen people,
There's a role we can play

578
00:59:27,317 --> 00:59:31,488
Every baby has a right to be born

579
00:59:32,281 --> 00:59:35,701
Don't turn your back now
They're crying out today

580
00:59:35,951 --> 00:59:39,913
You got to fight for the children

581
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:44,293
Tell me what would Jesus do?

582
00:59:44,501 --> 00:59:48,589
You got to fight for the children

583
00:59:49,339 --> 00:59:52,593
You know
They would fight for you.

584
00:59:54,303 --> 00:59:56,180
Coming!

585
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:01,059
Hey, it's Dr Dan!
- And Earl too!

586
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:03,353
Hey, let's sing the Dr Dan song!

587
01:00:04,021 --> 01:00:06,440
Go, Dr Dan

588
01:00:06,648 --> 01:00:08,275
Go, Dr Dan
Go! Go!

589
01:00:08,484 --> 01:00:11,528
It's time for you to get down

590
01:00:11,778 --> 01:00:13,113
Go, Dr Dan

591
01:00:13,322 --> 01:00:15,324
Go, Dr Dan
Go! Go!

592
01:00:15,532 --> 01:00:18,368
Shake it down to the ground

593
01:00:18,577 --> 01:00:21,872
When you put your feet in motion
In motion

594
01:00:22,122 --> 01:00:24,917
Everybody knows you're the man
Who's the man

595
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:29,129
Dancing for the love of the Lord
My Dr Dan

596
01:00:29,379 --> 01:00:31,673
Ooh, Dr Dan

597
01:00:31,924 --> 01:00:35,844
Go, go, go, Dr Dan...

598
01:00:36,178 --> 01:00:40,390
You children are wonderful,
like a choir of angels!

599
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:43,644
Creamsicles for everybody!

600
01:00:43,852 --> 01:00:46,688
Earl, Earl. Go, go, go, go, go.

601
01:00:46,897 --> 01:00:50,275
Go, go, go, go, my Dr Dan!

602
01:00:57,199 --> 01:01:01,662
<i>And behold -</i>
<i>Jesus walked on the water</i>.</i>

603
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:05,249
<i>And when they saw Him walking</i>
<i>on top of the sea, </i></i>

604
01:01:05,457 --> 01:01:09,753
<i>they turned white and gasped, </i>
<i>"It is a ghost.!"</i></i>

605
01:01:09,962 --> 01:01:12,840
<i>But Jesus spoke</i>
<i>to them calmly, saying, </i></i>

606
01:01:13,048 --> 01:01:17,219
<i>"Be of good cheer, </i>
<i>and fear not, for it is I. "</i></i>

607
01:01:17,427 --> 01:01:19,638
<i>Peter turned to Him and shouted, </i></i>

608
01:01:19,847 --> 01:01:23,767
<i>"Lord, if it is you, </i>
<i>let me come to you in the water. "</i></i>

609
01:01:23,976 --> 01:01:26,395
<i>"Come, " said Jesus</i>.</i>

610
01:01:26,603 --> 01:01:29,189
<i>So Peter tried walking on the water, </i></i>

611
01:01:29,398 --> 01:01:32,943
<i>but he became afraid</i>
<i>and began to sink</i>.</i>

612
01:01:33,193 --> 01:01:35,696
<i>"Lord, save me.!" Peter cried</i>.</i>

613
01:01:35,904 --> 01:01:39,449
<i>And Jesus bent over the water, </i>
<i>stretched forth His hand</i></i>

614
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,326
<i>and saved him</i>.</i>

615
01:01:41,535 --> 01:01:45,581
<i>"O ye of little faith</i>.
<i>Why did you doubt?"</i></i>

616
01:01:45,789 --> 01:01:47,833
<i>And when they returned to the boat</i>...</i>

617
01:01:57,384 --> 01:01:59,761
Fleischer. Fleischer.

618
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:06,393
You know what 'Fleischer' means?

619
01:02:06,643 --> 01:02:09,146
What?
- 'Butcher'.

620
01:02:09,354 --> 01:02:11,482
Oh, good God!

621
01:02:13,066 --> 01:02:18,489
Now, I've got all the details
on this Fleischer in this envelope -

622
01:02:18,697 --> 01:02:22,075
home and work address,
licence plate number,

623
01:02:22,284 --> 01:02:24,119
golf club, maps etc.

624
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:28,165
It should take
about three days of driving

625
01:02:28,373 --> 01:02:31,627
for you to get out there
and take care of him.

626
01:02:32,628 --> 01:02:35,380
Call me as soon
as the job's done, OK?

627
01:02:35,589 --> 01:02:37,633
OK.

628
01:02:40,427 --> 01:02:44,306
Earl? Earl!

629
01:02:47,184 --> 01:02:50,354
Are you sure you're ready
to go through with this?

630
01:02:50,562 --> 01:02:52,189
Uh-huh.

631
01:02:52,397 --> 01:02:54,858
Because you seem a little...

632
01:02:55,067 --> 01:02:58,403
I don't know...
a little preoccupied tonight.

633
01:02:59,655 --> 01:03:02,074
No, sorry. Just...

634
01:03:03,408 --> 01:03:06,370
I'm tired, that's all. Work.

635
01:03:13,168 --> 01:03:15,420
Bo?
- Yeah?

636
01:03:15,629 --> 01:03:18,924
One more thing
before we say goodnight.

637
01:03:19,132 --> 01:03:20,968
What's on your mind?

638
01:03:21,176 --> 01:03:23,595
That new girl of yours...

639
01:03:23,804 --> 01:03:25,639
What about her?

640
01:03:25,848 --> 01:03:30,352
I don't know how to say this, Bo,
but when I examined her yesterday...

641
01:03:31,436 --> 01:03:34,648
Yeah?
- That girl's a child whore.

642
01:03:35,524 --> 01:03:37,359
You should know that much

643
01:03:37,568 --> 01:03:41,947
before you go any further
with making her part of the family.

644
01:03:42,156 --> 01:03:44,199
You mean you checked her?

645
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,833
Does Mama Sunshine know about this?

646
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:57,629
No, I thought you should know first.
I wasn't sure she could handle this.

647
01:04:01,049 --> 01:04:03,635
I never had a slut
in my house before.

648
01:04:03,844 --> 01:04:06,597
Well, maybe she's not a slut.

649
01:04:08,056 --> 01:04:12,144
It's worse than that, Earl.
I took some pictures.

650
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,356
Just got them developed.
- Let me see those.

651
01:04:21,236 --> 01:04:23,280
Oh, dear Lord!

652
01:04:26,617 --> 01:04:28,660
Oh, sweet Jesus!

653
01:04:28,869 --> 01:04:30,913
Refreshments!

654
01:04:37,252 --> 01:04:39,755
I've got all your favourites!

655
01:04:44,384 --> 01:04:47,804
Here we go!

656
01:05:30,097 --> 01:05:33,350
Goodbye, Peter Paul. I'll miss you.

657
01:05:34,852 --> 01:05:37,938
Harlot! Harlot!

658
01:05:38,188 --> 01:05:41,608
No! No! Get away! Get away from here!

659
01:05:42,693 --> 01:05:44,987
Get away from me! Get away.

660
01:06:31,867 --> 01:06:33,911
Why did you leave me?

661
01:06:35,245 --> 01:06:38,499
How did you get here?
You have to go. Go home.

662
01:06:38,707 --> 01:06:42,586
No, I want to be with you.
I feel comfortable with you.

663
01:06:42,836 --> 01:06:45,964
You're too young.
- No, you know I'm not.

664
01:06:47,299 --> 01:06:49,343
I don't know you.

665
01:06:49,593 --> 01:06:52,012
You know me.
You know you know me.

666
01:06:52,846 --> 01:06:57,017
I can't know you.
- But you do. You do. You do!

667
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:23,710
I know Dr Fleischer.

668
01:07:37,349 --> 01:07:40,936
Time to take now
Time to make

669
01:07:41,145 --> 01:07:45,315
Time to make
Right out of wrong

670
01:07:48,735 --> 01:07:52,281
Got to be, try to be

671
01:07:52,531 --> 01:07:57,995
Have to be, need to be strong

672
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:02,958
Then I'll be, want to be

673
01:08:04,001 --> 01:08:10,174
Going to be up on a cloud

674
01:08:11,216 --> 01:08:15,053
Love is near, love is here

675
01:08:15,262 --> 01:08:20,559
Love is here, up on a cloud.

676
01:08:31,778 --> 01:08:33,822
Have you ever been in love?

677
01:08:38,827 --> 01:08:40,871
What do you mean?

678
01:08:42,748 --> 01:08:44,791
I don't know.

679
01:08:45,501 --> 01:08:47,544
I was just wondering because...

680
01:08:49,171 --> 01:08:53,800
...well... I think we should talk
about our relationship.

681
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:02,351
Women basically don't like me.

682
01:09:04,186 --> 01:09:06,230
Is that why you're not married?

683
01:09:06,438 --> 01:09:08,482
I don't know.

684
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:14,905
I guess maybe
I don't like women, either.

685
01:09:18,992 --> 01:09:22,579
Well... what about me?

686
01:09:22,788 --> 01:09:24,832
You're not a woman.

687
01:09:26,917 --> 01:09:28,544
Not yet.

688
01:09:31,088 --> 01:09:33,090
What am l, then?

689
01:09:33,298 --> 01:09:35,133
You're...

690
01:09:39,263 --> 01:09:41,098
...different.

691
01:09:47,354 --> 01:09:48,981
Earl...

692
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:53,819
...do you think you could
make love to me tonight?

693
01:09:55,612 --> 01:09:58,782
Even if it's not the regular way.

694
01:10:03,245 --> 01:10:05,330
I'm sorry.

695
01:10:05,539 --> 01:10:09,626
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

696
01:10:10,502 --> 01:10:12,546
I was moving too fast.

697
01:10:14,298 --> 01:10:16,341
I'm sorry.

698
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:21,847
It's OK. It's OK, I understand.

699
01:10:22,806 --> 01:10:24,850
Relationships take time.

700
01:10:35,235 --> 01:10:38,405
 We need a story.
- What do you mean?

701
01:10:38,447 --> 01:10:40,741
Just in case.

702
01:10:43,827 --> 01:10:46,872
Oh. Yeah.

703
01:10:47,623 --> 01:10:51,752
You're my daughter.
No, my half-sister.

704
01:10:53,253 --> 01:10:56,173
No... No.

705
01:10:57,424 --> 01:11:00,135
Maybe you could be
one of my teachers.

706
01:11:00,802 --> 01:11:03,847
What subject?
- Math?

707
01:11:04,097 --> 01:11:08,185
No good. I can't fake that.
- History?

708
01:11:10,979 --> 01:11:12,856
PE?

709
01:11:17,402 --> 01:11:23,200
Maybe you're an undercover policeman,
returning me to my parents.

710
01:11:23,408 --> 01:11:28,372
Maybe I just set up an undercover
sting operation for paedophiles.

711
01:11:28,622 --> 01:11:30,749
And I'm the decoy!

712
01:11:37,005 --> 01:11:40,717
I could pass for Mexican.
Maybe I could be your driver.

713
01:11:40,968 --> 01:11:45,180
Do you speak Spanish?
- No.

714
01:11:46,014 --> 01:11:48,058
Maybe...

715
01:11:51,228 --> 01:11:53,856
Why can't we just be friends?

716
01:12:06,785 --> 01:12:09,913
I think you'll have to be
my daughter...

717
01:12:12,291 --> 01:12:14,334
...but adopted.

718
01:12:15,085 --> 01:12:20,174
Can't I be your wife? Please?
I really think I could pass.

719
01:12:20,757 --> 01:12:23,760
No. It wouldn't be legal.

720
01:12:23,969 --> 01:12:28,182
You're my... daughter.

721
01:12:52,623 --> 01:12:54,249
What?

722
01:13:07,763 --> 01:13:09,598
Sickos.

723
01:14:14,121 --> 01:14:16,165
What do we do now?

724
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:20,127
We'll lay low,
then come back after dark.

725
01:15:01,251 --> 01:15:05,297
You stay here.
- No, I want to come.

726
01:15:05,547 --> 01:15:08,675
It's no good if you come.
I need you as a lookout.

727
01:15:08,884 --> 01:15:11,094
Honk once, I come back, we go.

728
01:15:11,303 --> 01:15:14,515
No. I'm coming.
- Don't make me mad.

729
01:15:14,765 --> 01:15:19,520
I'm coming. I have to.
You don't know him. I do.

730
01:16:01,186 --> 01:16:03,230
...you! Baby, It's You!

731
01:16:05,149 --> 01:16:07,860
OK, it's my turn. My turn, right?

732
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:25,169
Do it.

733
01:16:26,503 --> 01:16:28,630
Do it!

734
01:16:36,638 --> 01:16:39,308
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

735
01:16:53,405 --> 01:16:57,201
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!
I'm going straight to Hell!

736
01:16:57,784 --> 01:17:00,704
Calm down! Stop speeding!
- I'll get caught!

737
01:17:00,913 --> 01:17:03,790
They'll fry me!
I don't want to die!

738
01:17:03,999 --> 01:17:08,795
Stop it! Please stop it!
- Oh, God, it's over! I'm dead meat!

739
01:17:09,004 --> 01:17:11,715
Stop it!
Earl, get a hold of yourself!

740
01:17:34,863 --> 01:17:38,951
Is she your daughter?
- Half-daughter.

741
01:18:01,348 --> 01:18:03,392
Feel better?

742
01:18:04,893 --> 01:18:06,937
I did the wrong thing.

743
01:18:07,146 --> 01:18:10,399
No, no. You did the right thing.
He deserved it.

744
01:18:10,607 --> 01:18:14,111
He was a terrible person. Terrible.
- But the girl!

745
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:17,322
It was an accident.
- Oh, the girl, the girl.

746
01:18:17,531 --> 01:18:20,450
Maybe she's OK.
- God hates me.

747
01:18:20,659 --> 01:18:23,954
No, God loves you!
- I'm going to fry.

748
01:18:24,163 --> 01:18:28,834
No! No, you're innocent like a baby.
You did what you had to do.

749
01:18:29,042 --> 01:18:32,045
You did it for me
and the other little babies.

750
01:18:32,254 --> 01:18:35,591
Babies that want to live.
- I want to live, too.

751
01:18:36,258 --> 01:18:38,469
I want to start a new life,

752
01:18:38,677 --> 01:18:42,473
a good life,
with no mistakes this time.

753
01:18:43,348 --> 01:18:48,061
We could have children.
I promise. Lots.

754
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:51,064
I'd be a dad and you'd be a mum

755
01:18:51,273 --> 01:18:56,111
and there'd be so much love and
tenderness for every living creature.

756
01:18:57,404 --> 01:18:59,615
I could change,

757
01:19:00,532 --> 01:19:03,243
but now I'm going to die!

758
01:19:03,452 --> 01:19:08,081
No, no! I'll tell them I did it.
That I pulled the trigger.

759
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:12,753
Would you do that?
- Yes, I'd do anything for you.

760
01:19:12,961 --> 01:19:15,881
But you can't!
You're too young and innocent!

761
01:19:16,089 --> 01:19:20,469
No, but I love you.
- Oh, God, I want to die!

762
01:19:20,677 --> 01:19:22,721
I want to die!

763
01:19:22,930 --> 01:19:26,266
How many more times
can I be born again?

764
01:19:54,169 --> 01:19:55,587
Hello?

765
01:19:57,256 --> 01:19:58,674
Uh-huh.

766
01:20:00,217 --> 01:20:02,052
Uh-huh. OK.

767
01:20:03,512 --> 01:20:07,266
Yeah... OK.

768
01:20:11,645 --> 01:20:15,607
Who was that?
- The cops are here.

769
01:20:22,614 --> 01:20:24,658
We're surrounded.

770
01:20:29,663 --> 01:20:31,707
What are you doing?

771
01:20:34,293 --> 01:20:36,837
I'm going to say goodbye.
- Oh, God.

772
01:20:38,088 --> 01:20:40,132
Oh, God, I hate this world!

773
01:20:40,382 --> 01:20:42,885
Don't say that. God created it.

774
01:20:43,469 --> 01:20:49,099
Oh, Earl, Earl, Earl!
- My real name's Bob.

775
01:20:50,184 --> 01:20:52,227
My real name's Aviva.

776
01:20:57,483 --> 01:20:58,567
Wait!

777
01:21:21,548 --> 01:21:23,592
OK, who else?

778
01:21:23,801 --> 01:21:29,431
We've got the Paskows...
the Santolas, the Weisses, the Wongs.

779
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,475
What about the Wieners?

780
01:21:32,684 --> 01:21:37,731
Well, we have Harv and Marj
and Missy and Vlad and little Di.

781
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:41,026
What about Mark?
- Steve...

782
01:21:42,277 --> 01:21:44,321
She's old enough. Tell her.

783
01:21:48,617 --> 01:21:51,078
Your cousin Mark is a child molester.

784
01:21:51,286 --> 01:21:53,205
An accused child molester.

785
01:21:53,413 --> 01:21:55,457
Missy had him arrested.

786
01:21:55,666 --> 01:21:59,378
She said that her baby Diana...
- Princess Diana.

787
01:21:59,586 --> 01:22:04,967
Little Di was molested, when
Mark was alone with her babysitting.

788
01:22:05,175 --> 01:22:08,178
Nobody's proven it.
It hasn't gone to court.

789
01:22:09,596 --> 01:22:12,933
Poor Marj.
She's been through so much.

790
01:22:13,142 --> 01:22:17,646
And Missy was kidnapped by
a child molester when she was little.

791
01:22:17,855 --> 01:22:21,525
It's been in the papers,
but there's no evidence.

792
01:22:21,733 --> 01:22:26,405
Mark was always a little weird.
- He seemed pretty regular to me.

793
01:22:26,613 --> 01:22:30,492
So you see my situation?
I don't know what I should do.

794
01:22:30,701 --> 01:22:32,744
I think you should invite him.

795
01:22:35,873 --> 01:22:37,916
OK. It's your party.

796
01:22:43,505 --> 01:22:45,549
Jesus Christ!

797
01:22:56,435 --> 01:22:59,771
Mum, are you OK?

798
01:23:05,068 --> 01:23:08,489
Sometimes it's so hard
to be a good mother.

799
01:23:12,367 --> 01:23:14,411
God knows, I tried.

800
01:23:18,999 --> 01:23:22,169
Then I was so scared, Aviva.

801
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:32,304
Am I a terrible mother?

802
01:23:36,141 --> 01:23:39,144
Everybody makes mistakes.

803
01:23:53,951 --> 01:23:56,203
I'm going to change now.

804
01:23:58,413 --> 01:24:01,583
I did some real soul-searching.

805
01:24:03,627 --> 01:24:06,004
And I'm going to be a better mother.

806
01:24:12,386 --> 01:24:14,221
I promise.

807
01:24:35,826 --> 01:24:39,121
So, that's it? No one else?

808
01:24:39,371 --> 01:24:44,168
I think you should invite
Mama Sunshine and her family also.

809
01:24:44,376 --> 01:24:47,921
Honey, they live so far away.

810
01:24:49,339 --> 01:24:51,258
Sweetie...

811
01:24:51,467 --> 01:24:53,594
wasn't the father indicted?

812
01:24:53,802 --> 01:24:56,096
I want them to come.

813
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:03,896
OK.

814
01:25:04,104 --> 01:25:08,150
OK, I could
send them an invitation.

815
01:25:14,323 --> 01:25:18,660
Marj wouldn't come, you know.
She says she's just too upset.

816
01:25:19,536 --> 01:25:21,580
Nobody feels for Marj like I do.

817
01:25:21,788 --> 01:25:25,417
Well, it's out of proportion.
You know Missy.

818
01:25:25,626 --> 01:25:29,129
I don't know what she's saying.
Is she making it up?

819
01:25:29,338 --> 01:25:31,715
Mark's a good kid.
- Hey, sweetie.

820
01:25:31,924 --> 01:25:36,970
Teriyaki soy dog?
They're your favourite... OK.

821
01:25:38,806 --> 01:25:40,849
They'll be here.

822
01:25:49,483 --> 01:25:52,152
Welcome home, Aviva!

823
01:26:02,913 --> 01:26:06,208
Don't look.
Mark Wiener is looking at you.

824
01:26:09,378 --> 01:26:11,421
Let's get out of here.

825
01:26:25,978 --> 01:26:30,399
Hey.
- I'm glad you came.

826
01:26:31,066 --> 01:26:35,195
I had to. Not coming
would be an admission of guilt.

827
01:26:35,404 --> 01:26:38,198
I have to hold onto
some shred of dignity.

828
01:26:40,325 --> 01:26:42,536
So, how's it feel being back home?

829
01:26:44,496 --> 01:26:46,123
OK.

830
01:26:46,331 --> 01:26:49,251
Dawn tried to do the same thing
at your age.

831
01:26:49,459 --> 01:26:52,296
It's always a mistake.
It never works.

832
01:26:53,130 --> 01:26:55,299
Do I remind you of Dawn?

833
01:26:56,383 --> 01:26:59,344
Yeah, a little.
But of course different.

834
01:26:59,553 --> 01:27:03,265
She was she. You're you.
X is not equal to Y.

835
01:27:03,932 --> 01:27:06,560
Do you think I'll end up like her?

836
01:27:06,810 --> 01:27:09,730
People always end up
the way they start out.

837
01:27:09,938 --> 01:27:13,817
No one ever changes.
They think they do, but they don't.

838
01:27:14,026 --> 01:27:17,905
If you're the depressed type,
that's how you'll always be.

839
01:27:18,113 --> 01:27:21,742
If you're the happy type,
that's how you'll always be.

840
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:25,162
You may lose weight,
your face might clear up,

841
01:27:25,370 --> 01:27:31,126
get a body tan, a breast enlargement,
a sex change-makes no difference.

842
01:27:32,419 --> 01:27:36,423
Essentially, from in front,
from behind,

843
01:27:36,632 --> 01:27:40,677
whether you're 13 or 50,
you'll always be the same.

844
01:27:41,386 --> 01:27:43,472
Are you the same?

845
01:27:46,058 --> 01:27:49,937
Yeah.
- Are you glad you're the same?

846
01:27:50,145 --> 01:27:53,732
It doesn't matter if I'm glad.
There's no free will.

847
01:27:53,941 --> 01:27:56,985
I have no choice
but to choose what I choose,

848
01:27:57,194 --> 01:27:59,530
to do what I do, to live as I live.

849
01:27:59,738 --> 01:28:02,032
Ultimately, we're all just robots,

850
01:28:02,241 --> 01:28:05,994
programmed arbitrarily
by nature's genetic code.

851
01:28:06,703 --> 01:28:09,122
But isn't there any hope?

852
01:28:09,373 --> 01:28:11,166
For what?

853
01:28:11,375 --> 01:28:16,004
We hope or despair because of our
programming. Genes and randomness.

854
01:28:16,213 --> 01:28:18,715
That's all, and none of it matters.

855
01:28:19,842 --> 01:28:24,388
Does that mean you're never going
to get married and have children?

856
01:28:26,098 --> 01:28:28,767
I have no desire
to marry or have kids,

857
01:28:28,976 --> 01:28:30,978
but that's beyond my control.

858
01:28:31,186 --> 01:28:35,440
It makes no difference, as the planet
is running out of resources,

859
01:28:35,691 --> 01:28:38,485
and we won't survive
to the next century.

860
01:28:38,694 --> 01:28:43,240
But what if you're wrong?
What if there is a God?

861
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:45,534
If that makes you feel better.

862
01:28:46,910 --> 01:28:48,954
Look, Mummy, look!

863
01:28:51,248 --> 01:28:53,417
Gwyneth, no!

864
01:29:01,091 --> 01:29:05,971
Do you think Dawn was ever
any happier when she was older?

865
01:29:07,848 --> 01:29:10,517
Yeah. There were moments.

866
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:14,813
Moments... here and there...

867
01:29:15,772 --> 01:29:19,443
Maybe when she got in to Rutgers,
I guess. I don't know.

868
01:29:21,361 --> 01:29:26,700
Aviva, come over here.
I want to introduce you to somebody.

869
01:29:29,369 --> 01:29:31,413
I have to go.

870
01:29:34,166 --> 01:29:39,087
Thanks for coming over to talk to me.
I appreciate it.

871
01:29:40,756 --> 01:29:42,382
I'm not a paedophile.

872
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:46,637
I know.

873
01:29:46,845 --> 01:29:51,809
I believe you,
because paedophiles love children.

874
01:30:30,055 --> 01:30:32,182
Hey.
- Hey.

875
01:30:50,450 --> 01:30:53,829
How's it going?
- OK.

876
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:00,919
It only took three and a half hours.
There was no traffic.

877
01:31:05,007 --> 01:31:07,217
How do you like the car?

878
01:31:08,886 --> 01:31:10,929
It's nice.

879
01:31:13,307 --> 01:31:17,769
It's a Corvette C5.
It gets really good miles per gallon.

880
01:31:18,729 --> 01:31:22,774
Did your dad buy it for you?
- Er... yeah.

881
01:31:22,983 --> 01:31:26,445
But... I'm going to pay him back.

882
01:31:30,449 --> 01:31:34,620
The radio doesn't work.
I don't know what happened.

883
01:31:34,828 --> 01:31:39,958
I've got built-in speakers.
But I have to get it fixed.

884
01:31:41,543 --> 01:31:45,130
You know, Judah,
you look a little different.

885
01:31:46,548 --> 01:31:49,134
I changed my name.
- Really? To what?

886
01:31:51,428 --> 01:31:56,934
Otto. It's my middle name.
I think it sounds a lot cooler.

887
01:31:57,142 --> 01:32:00,521
So from now on,
I tell everyone to call me Otto.

888
01:32:50,737 --> 01:32:52,781
I'm really glad you called me.

889
01:32:54,449 --> 01:32:56,493
Me, too.

890
01:32:57,327 --> 01:33:00,455
Your parents hung up
whenever I tried calling.

891
01:33:02,916 --> 01:33:04,960
I know.

892
01:33:07,212 --> 01:33:09,256
I was worried about you.

893
01:33:10,466 --> 01:33:14,011
Your parents must have been
totally freaked out.

894
01:33:15,471 --> 01:33:17,097
Yeah.

895
01:33:20,726 --> 01:33:22,978
The cops asked me some questions.

896
01:33:23,187 --> 01:33:28,108
They thought maybe I was involved.
I didn't tell them anything.

897
01:33:32,905 --> 01:33:35,782
Are you seeing anyone?

898
01:33:35,991 --> 01:33:40,787
A couple of girls are interested
in me, but I don't know...

899
01:33:40,996 --> 01:33:45,292
I like to play it cool, you know.
- Yeah.

900
01:33:45,501 --> 01:33:50,339
I mean, I'm not interested
in just sex. I'm not like that.

901
01:33:51,757 --> 01:33:53,801
I know.

902
01:33:55,636 --> 01:33:57,679
How's your feature coming along?

903
01:34:00,098 --> 01:34:04,853
I stopped working on it.
I decided my whole idea sucked.

904
01:34:05,604 --> 01:34:08,357
I guess it's better
to know it sucks now,

905
01:34:08,565 --> 01:34:12,569
than working on it for two years
and then realising it sucks.

906
01:34:34,049 --> 01:34:37,594
Aviva, I think I've kind of...

907
01:34:39,429 --> 01:34:42,099
...matured a lot
since I last saw you.

908
01:34:43,392 --> 01:34:45,435
Really changed.

909
01:34:52,651 --> 01:34:54,695
One second.

910
01:36:07,851 --> 01:36:13,190
Fuck!
- No, it was good! Much better!

911
01:36:13,899 --> 01:36:18,070
But then it slipped out!
- Part of it got inside.

912
01:36:18,278 --> 01:36:20,614
Yeah, but the timing
was off. Fuck!

913
01:36:20,823 --> 01:36:24,076
God, no! It was really good!

914
01:36:24,284 --> 01:36:27,037
And a lot of it
really did get inside me.

915
01:36:27,246 --> 01:36:31,166
You're just saying that.
- No, I mean it.

916
01:36:33,585 --> 01:36:35,879
Really? You mean, like...

917
01:36:36,130 --> 01:36:41,009
Yes, Otto, and I have a feeling,

918
01:36:41,218 --> 01:36:45,389
though it's just a feeling,
that this time...

919
01:36:46,181 --> 01:36:48,475
I'm going to be a mum.

920
01:36:55,566 --> 01:36:59,528
Everybody's different
In this great big world

921
01:36:59,736 --> 01:37:02,739
That's what life is all about

922
01:37:02,948 --> 01:37:04,575
Oh yeah

923
01:37:04,783 --> 01:37:08,078
There is something special
In every boy and girl

924
01:37:08,287 --> 01:37:09,913
Don't hide it away

925
01:37:10,122 --> 01:37:13,959
Let it out
Let it out

926
01:37:14,168 --> 01:37:18,213
This is the way that Jesus made us

927
01:37:18,422 --> 01:37:22,801
This is the way we're meant to be

928
01:37:23,010 --> 01:37:27,431
This is the way that Jesus made us

929
01:37:27,639 --> 01:37:31,727
So let's celebrate for all to see

This is the way

932
01:37:39,443 --> 01:37:41,069
Come on

933
01:37:42,154 --> 01:37:46,116
Every single person
Has a role to play

934
01:37:46,325 --> 01:37:50,871
Written by the Lord above

935
01:37:51,079 --> 01:37:54,416
Everything we do
And every word we say

936
01:37:54,625 --> 01:37:59,755
Oh, He guides us
From Heaven with love

937
01:37:59,963 --> 01:38:04,968
Yeah, yeah
This is the way that Jesus made us

938

And you think
Your heart's going to break

944

Remember this is the way
That Jesus made you

945
01:38:32,788 --> 01:38:36,500
And he'd never make a mistake

946

We got Shazaam on drums

947
01:38:45,467 --> 01:38:49,721
Go, Crystal
Oh yeah

948
01:38:49,930 --> 01:38:54,184
Carlito
Sweet, sweet, sweet Jesus, yeah
