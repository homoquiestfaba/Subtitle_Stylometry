MAN'S VOICE:
<i>I used to dream about flying.</i>

3
00:00:26,835 --> 00:00:29,207
<i>It went the same way</i>
<i>every night--</i>

4
00:00:29,242 --> 00:00:31,291
<i>I'd realize</i>
<i>that I could fly--</i>

5
00:00:31,326 --> 00:00:33,305
<i>No, that's not</i>
<i>quite right.</i>

6
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,007
<i>I'd realize that there</i>
<i>was no reason I couldn't fly.</i>

7
00:00:36,195 --> 00:00:39,260
<i>And after that,</i>
<i>I'd float off the ground</i>

8
00:00:39,295 --> 00:00:41,585
<i>and soar above the city.</i>

9
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,380
<i>But I haven't had</i>
<i>that dream in a while now.</i>

10
00:00:44,415 --> 00:00:47,105
<i>Lately I dream about</i>
<i>more ordinary things</i>

11
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,020
<i>like doing my laundry</i>
<i>or shopping for groceries</i>

12
00:00:50,055 --> 00:00:52,385
<i>or riding on elevators.</i>

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,580
<i>I wonder</i>
<i>why that is.</i>

14
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,420
MAN: <i>Drug use, prescription</i>
<i>or otherwise?</i>

15
00:01:50,455 --> 00:01:51,985
No.

16
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,940
<i>Do you experience</i>
<i>persistent headaches?</i>

17
00:01:53,975 --> 00:01:55,305
No.

18
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,265
- <i>Trouble sleeping?</i>
- No.

19
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,020
<i>Any feelings</i>
<i>of lethargy?</i>

20
00:01:59,055 --> 00:02:01,265
- No.
- <i>Lack of appetite?</i>

21
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,860
<i>Difficulty becoming</i>
<i>sexually aroused,</i>

22
00:02:03,895 --> 00:02:05,265
<i>maintaining</i>
<i>an erection?</i>

23
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,300
<i>Problems with</i>
<i>premature ejaculation?</i>

24
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,985
No.

25
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,900
<i>What about thoughts of a
suicidal or homicidal nature?</i>

26
00:02:11,935 --> 00:02:13,700
No.

27
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,180
You never fantasize about
hurting anybody--

28
00:02:18,215 --> 00:02:20,580
yourself or others?

29
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,105
Well...

30
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,185
You know, sometimes,
I guess.

31
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,100
But, you know,
I would never act on it.

32
00:02:29,135 --> 00:02:31,300
I understand.

33
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,500
And you're in
good health, so...

34
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,300
There you go.

35
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:44,910
I'm in?

36
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:47,865
Take one pill a day,
preferably with food.

37
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,260
But wait, you don't-- you don't have
to wait for my blood-test results?

38
00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:53,585
No, we're good.

39
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,660
I just need your
John Hancock right there.

40
00:02:56,695 --> 00:02:59,665
And these-- these--
these really work?

41
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,740
Our results have been
remarkably promising.

42
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,900
Okay.

43
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,225
And there.

44
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,020
And also there.

45
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,380
Welcome to
our study...

46
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:21,025
Les.

47
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,105
And thank you.

48
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,020
'Cause you're not just
participating in a clinical trial,

49
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:28,137
you're helping develop
a medication

50
00:03:28,172 --> 00:03:30,076
that will benefit
a great many people.

51
00:03:30,111 --> 00:03:31,980
So you just pop in
here one time a week

52
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:33,780
so we can monitor
your progress.

53
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,220
And here's a free
T-shirt for you.

54
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,100
can I take
the first one now?

55
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:43,140
Mmm.

56
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,060
And how long till
I start feeling...

57
00:03:51,095 --> 00:03:53,060
you know, different?

LES'S VOICE: <i>I've decided to start</i>
<i>this medication journal</i>

60
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:14,820
<i>so I don't forget anything</i>
<i>noteworthy between visits.</i>

61
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:18,357
<i>It's funny because I joined</i>
<i>the study on a whim.</i>

62
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:21,860
<i>You see, I'm really</i>
<i>pretty happy with my life.</i>

63
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:24,260
<i>Well, maybe "happy"</i>
<i>isn't the right word,</i>

64
00:04:24,295 --> 00:04:26,140
<i>but I'm not unhappy.</i>

65
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:27,985
<i>It's more like</i>

66
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,500
<i>I once read about a monster</i>
<i>called the extricator</i>

67
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:32,545
<i>that lived off</i>
<i>people's souls.</i>

68
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,460
<i>Only the thing was, the extricator
ate a person's soul in their sleep</i>

69
00:04:35,495 --> 00:04:37,185
<i>over a 16-year period.</i>

70
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,260
<i>Like it would nibble</i>
<i>off a crumb every night</i>

71
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,265
<i>until there wasn't</i>
<i>anything left,</i>

72
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,420
<i>so a person had no way to</i>
<i>realize what was going on.</i>

73
00:04:44,455 --> 00:04:46,465
<i>They just had this</i>
<i>vague sense</i>

74
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,185
<i>that something was</i>
<i>slowly disappearing.</i>

75
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,820
<i>I don't know, maybe I am</i>
<i>a little depressed lately.</i>

76
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,820
Wait wait wait wait wait!

77
00:05:02,855 --> 00:05:04,697
You have to stop.

78
00:05:04,732 --> 00:05:06,505
I am so broke.

79
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,700
I'm sorry, ma'am, but I already
started writing the citation.

80
00:05:09,735 --> 00:05:13,665
Um, listen, you could
park here all day

81
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,580
and I promise I won't--
I won't write another ticket,

82
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:18,740
But once I start
writing the ticket--

83
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,460
See, I get
reprimanded if--

84
00:05:23,495 --> 00:05:25,580
Please...

85
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,540
<i>Oh, thank you!</i>
<i>Thank you so much!</i>

86
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,225
I'm sorry about that.

87
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,420

90
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,860
We're not gonna take any
comics you find in a dumpster.

91
00:05:50,895 --> 00:05:52,505
<i>End of story.</i>

00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,900
What do you say, chief?
Five bucks?

93
00:05:54,935 --> 00:05:57,260
What if someone
pissed on them?

94
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,420
I swear to God, if you
pay him for those, I'm--

You're a good little man.

96

97
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,500
You're a very bad

98
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,425
Les?

99
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,660
Could you explain to
my retarded sibling here

100
00:06:15,695 --> 00:06:17,825
that I can't keep the store
open if he insists

101
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,900
on throwing our money away
on crackhead piss comics?

102
00:06:20,935 --> 00:06:23,660
I should-- I probably
should go back to work.

103
00:06:23,695 --> 00:06:25,220
Oh, Les, Les?
Come here, man.

104
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,025
Check it out--
I got you the new "Iron Woman,"

105
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,345
The new "Nightmare Killer"
and the new "Time Travel."

106
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:31,613
Cool.

107
00:06:31,614 --> 00:06:34,180
<i>I'm so sick of people
thinking "Time Travel"</i>

108
00:06:34,215 --> 00:06:36,425
is all about some dude who
shows up from nowhere

109
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,660
saying, "I've come from the
future that will no longer exist,"

110
00:06:39,695 --> 00:06:41,937
<i>and then fixes</i>
<i>your problems.</i>

00:06:41,972 --> 00:06:44,180
<i>Don't let him</i>
<i>harsh you, Les.</i>

112
00:06:44,215 --> 00:06:46,477
"Time Travel"
is seriously dope

113
00:06:46,512 --> 00:06:48,740
in an old-school
kind of way.

114
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,865
Yo, if you want
to come by later,

115
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,300
we rented this crazy iranian
knockoff-- "When Animals Attack."

116
00:06:55,335 --> 00:06:56,785
Yeah, man, come by.
Check it out.

117
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,500
Save me from another night
alone with Captain Piss Comic.

118
00:06:59,535 --> 00:07:01,305
Sure.

119
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,700
Yeah, maybe.

LES'S VOICE: <i>I know I'm too old to</i>
<i>like comics as much as I do,</i>

121
00:07:19,755 --> 00:07:23,020
<i>but in comics, a villain can
launch a missile at a superhero</i>

122
00:07:23,055 --> 00:07:25,225
<i>and the hero</i>
<i>just keeps coming.</i>

123
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,580
<i>And then the villain</i>
<i>can throw an atom bomb</i>

124
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:29,900
<i>or an asteroid or an entire</i>
<i>planet at the hero,</i>

125
00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:31,945
<i>but that won't</i>
<i>stop them either.</i>

126
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,665
<i>Because a real superhero</i>
<i>is like a force of nature.</i>

127
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,700
<i>And when I read comics, I get this
faint glimpse of what it would be like</i>

128
00:07:38,735 --> 00:07:41,597
<i>to be not just</i>
<i>stronger, faster,</i>

129
00:07:41,632 --> 00:07:44,486
<i>or smarter than</i>
<i>ordinary people,</i>

130
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:47,340
<i>but what it would</i>
<i>be like to be,</i>

131
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:50,820
<i>well, to be unstoppable.</i>

132
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,260
Les, Les, Les, Les.

133
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,700
You want to explain this
to me, champ?

134
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,865
Yeah, I'm sorry, Steve,
I just--

135
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,425
<i>I like you, kid.</i>
<i>I really do.</i>

136
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,740
But the money that
those parasites con from you,

137
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,020
it goes to schools,
hospitals, soup kitchens.

138
00:08:15,055 --> 00:08:17,225
So really what
you're doing is,

139
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,780
you're helping them steal from
terminally-ill homeless children.

140
00:08:19,815 --> 00:08:22,020
- No, I know--
- <i>I know it's tough out there.</i>

141
00:08:22,055 --> 00:08:24,340
Believe me. Even our
fellow police officers

142
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,225
think we're some
kind of joke.

143
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,305
That's why you have to
remind yourself

144
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,060
that we are the ones that
keep this city running.

145
00:08:31,095 --> 00:08:33,105
I know.

146
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,680
Then say it.

147
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:36,220
Pardon me?

148
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,460
The mantra exercise.

149
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,460
Look, I have seen this job snap
a lot tougher men than you, champ.

150
00:08:45,495 --> 00:08:48,105
So unless you change
your attitude,

151
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,980
I'm afraid you're not gonna
last much longer around here.

152
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,140
I'm important and
I keep this city running.

153
00:08:57,175 --> 00:08:58,705
Good.

154
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,820
Now repeat.

155
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,860
I'm important.

156
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:10,137
I'm important.

157
00:09:10,172 --> 00:09:12,380
I'm important.

00:12:20,175 --> 00:12:22,300
No no, I never felt better.
Why?

175
00:12:22,335 --> 00:12:23,625
Well...

176
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,785
Hey, has this happened
to anyone else?

177
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,540
No, I've never seen anything
quite like it before.

178
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:30,537
What do you think
caused this, Dr. Dobson?

179
00:12:30,572 --> 00:12:32,500
Well, I think we have
to discuss that--

180
00:12:32,535 --> 00:12:35,265
( knocking )

181
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,820
Could-- could you
excuse me for a second?

182
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:39,545
Is something wrong?

183
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,420
Just don't move.
I-- I'll be back in a moment or two.

184
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,140
- <i>What seems to be--</i>
- <i>( door closes )</i>

185
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,020
Sorry about that, Les.

186
00:13:05,055 --> 00:13:07,237
Who are those people?

187
00:13:07,272 --> 00:13:09,420
Please just follow me.

188
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,300
DR. DOBSON'S THOUGHTS:
<i>Can you hear me, Les?</i>

189
00:13:27,335 --> 00:13:28,757
Of course.

190
00:13:28,792 --> 00:13:30,145
Excuse me?

191
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,260
<i>This room</i>
<i>could be bugged.</i>

192
00:13:32,295 --> 00:13:33,860
How'd you do that?

193
00:13:33,895 --> 00:13:35,105
Do what?

194
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,220
<i>I assume you've heard</i>
<i>of telepathy.</i>

195
00:13:37,255 --> 00:13:38,660
You're telepathic?

196
00:13:38,695 --> 00:13:39,905
What?

197
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,180
<i>I'm not telepathic, Les.</i>
<i>You are.</i>

198
00:13:42,215 --> 00:13:43,265
I am?

199
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,620
- You are what?
- Telepathic.

200
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,820
<i>The drug bestowed you</i>
<i>with many powers.</i>

201
00:13:57,855 --> 00:14:00,820
You're having an adverse
psychological reaction, Les.

202
00:14:00,855 --> 00:14:03,220
<i>You're reading</i>
<i>my mind right now.</i>

203
00:14:03,255 --> 00:14:06,220
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

204
00:14:06,255 --> 00:14:10,145
Why is this
happening to me?

205
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,820
The medication was designed
to suppress the chemicals

206
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:15,665
in the brain responsible
for self-doubt.

207
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,220
Unfortunately, brain chemistry
can be as unique

208
00:14:19,255 --> 00:14:22,180
and as unpredictable
as a fingerprint.

209
00:14:22,215 --> 00:14:24,100
Oh.

210
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,060
Okay.

211
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,780
So the medication unleashed
powers that I already had?

212
00:14:33,815 --> 00:14:36,905
What do you mean
by powers?

213
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,820
<i>Never mention</i>
<i>your powers out loud.</i>

214
00:14:39,855 --> 00:14:41,225
Why not?

215
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,865
<i>It isn't safe.</i>

216
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,305
The important thing is that you
cease the medication immediately.

217
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:50,020
<i>Luckily, it has a half-life that's
extremely short in the bloodstream.</i>

218
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,420
So whatever you're
experiencing should disappear

219
00:14:52,455 --> 00:14:54,620
soon after you've ingested
your last dose.

220
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,420
LES'S THOUGHTS:
<i>Can you hear me, Dr. Dobson?</i>

221
00:15:02,455 --> 00:15:05,225
<i>Very good, Les.</i>

222
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,980
<i>You're learning to control</i>
<i>your powers faster</i>

223
00:15:08,015 --> 00:15:09,780
<i>than I would have</i>
<i>dreamed possible.</i>

224
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,780
- Les?
- Just a second.

225
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,505
<i>Should I really stop</i>
<i>taking the medication?</i>

226
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,400
<i>Heavens no. </i> I just said that
<i>because they're listening.</i>

227
00:15:22,435 --> 00:15:25,260
<i>Keep taking one pill a day.</i>
<i>By the end of the cycle,</i>

228
00:15:25,295 --> 00:15:27,460
<i>your powers</i>
<i>will be permanent.</i>

229
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,220
What are you
staring at, Les?

230
00:15:33,255 --> 00:15:34,937
Sorry.

231
00:15:34,972 --> 00:15:36,936
Um...

232
00:15:36,971 --> 00:15:38,865
Okay.

233
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,265
So I'll just, um...

234
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,620
I'll just flush the rest
of the pills as--

235
00:15:45,655 --> 00:15:47,300
as soon as I get home.

236
00:15:47,335 --> 00:15:49,425
Good.

237
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,825
What's best for you
right now

238
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,220
is to go home,
have a good night's sleep,

239
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:57,380
get this all behind you.

240
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,060
Okay, I will.

241
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,785
<i>( lights buzzing )</i>

242
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,380
<i>I'm also obliged</i>
<i>to remind you</i>

243
00:16:09,415 --> 00:16:13,185
how seriously
this company takes the--

244
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,100
the nondisclosure section
of the contract you signed.

245
00:16:16,135 --> 00:16:17,825
I understand, Dr. Dobson.

246
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,300
I won't say anything
I'm not supposed to.

247
00:16:20,335 --> 00:16:22,705
If you have any problems
or concerns,

248
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,820
anything at all, this is
my personal phone number.

249
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:29,660
- Uh-huh.
- I want you to call me, anytime.

250
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,917
Thanks for everything.

251
00:16:31,952 --> 00:16:34,140
I really appreciate it.

252
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,660
<i>Take care, Les.</i>

253
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,865
WOMAN'S THOUGHTS:
<i>He could have simply asked,</i>

254
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,660
<i>but no, everything has to be a
passive-aggressive game with him.</i>

255
00:16:50,695 --> 00:16:54,020
<i>They should really get</i>
<i>better security in this place.</i>

256
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:00,060
<i>I'm fat, that's the problem.</i>
<i>I'm like a dump truck.</i>

257
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,100
WOMAN'S THOUGHTS: <i>It's like there are
two kinds of people in this world--</i>

258
00:17:10,135 --> 00:17:13,340
<i>Ones who feel bad when</i>
<i>rock stars kill themselves,</i>

259
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,540
<i>and the ones</i>
<i>who think it's funny.</i>

260
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,980
<i>( voices overlapping )</i>

261
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,580
<i>Like a sweet, juicy peach.</i>

262
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,340
<i>Peach cobbler--</i>
<i>I could go for some peach cobbler.</i>

263
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,900
<i>I miss Thelma.</i>

264
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,620
<i>( all thinking</i>
<i>in Japanese )</i>

265
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,100
<i>( voices fading )</i>

266
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,985
MAN'S THOUGHTS:
<i>Condoms?</i>

267
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,545
<i>I don't see her for</i>
<i>two months</i>

268
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,660
<i>and when I finally do,</i>
<i>she's buying condoms?</i>

269
00:18:29,695 --> 00:18:31,465
<i>with Chuck.</i>

270
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,580
<i>Oh, I have to sneak out</i>
<i>before they notice me.</i>

271
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:36,625
<i>Oh.</i>

272
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,420
<i>What if she spots me</i>
<i>trying to run away?</i>

273
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,420
<i>Don't be a sucker.</i>

274
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,580
<i>Don't be a little punk.</i>

275
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,340
<i>Just go over there and</i>
<i>shove the barrel in her face.</i>

276
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,540
<i>She'll give over</i>
<i>the cash.</i>

277
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,940
( both grunt )

278
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,260
Can't you read, bitch?

279
00:19:57,295 --> 00:19:58,545
Oh, shit.

280
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,740
Sorry, Les man.
I thought you were a customer.

281
00:20:00,775 --> 00:20:01,905
Hey, can I come in?

282
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,420
Yeah, mi casa es
your casa, bro.

283
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,020
Les man, you won't believe some
of these customers today, dude.

284
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,660
They go totally ballistic
if they can't get their manga

285
00:20:16,695 --> 00:20:18,545
exactly when they
want it, right?

286
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,660
Just knock knock knocking
all day long.

287
00:20:20,695 --> 00:20:21,985
Is Everett here?

288
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,145
'Cause I need to
show you guys something.

289
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,820
Yeah, dude, just go on back
and take a mental-health day.

290
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,900
<i>( beads rattle )</i>

291
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,505
<i>Les, my friend.</i>

292
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,385
Hey, explain to
my retarded sibling here--

293
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,700
Just because something
has a force field, right?

294
00:20:41,735 --> 00:20:43,425
It doesn't mean it
has to be invisible.

295
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,980
Don't even get into it
with him, Les, all right?

296
00:20:46,015 --> 00:20:48,597
He's been in
extra-cranky mode all day.

297
00:20:48,632 --> 00:20:51,180
Listen, I have to
tell you guys something.

298
00:20:51,215 --> 00:20:52,785
What is it, Les?

299
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,940
First you have to promise
you won't tell anyone.

300
00:20:54,975 --> 00:20:56,625
Tell anyone what?

301
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,425
Just promise me you're
not gonna tell anybody.

302
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,580
What are we, the fucking
Boy Scouts all of a sudden?

303
00:21:00,615 --> 00:21:02,197
I'm serious.

304
00:21:02,232 --> 00:21:03,780
I promise, Les.

305
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,940
You satisfied, or do we
need to pinkie swear too?

306
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:11,025
Okay.

307
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,900
The thing is...

308
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,900
I have super-powers.

309
00:21:18,935 --> 00:21:21,065
( both laugh )

310
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,420
You guys,
I'm serious.

311
00:21:23,455 --> 00:21:25,740
Oh, you--
you got me, Les.

312
00:21:25,775 --> 00:21:27,340
That was priceless.

313
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,860
You're thinking
about pizza.

314
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,580
And you're thinking
I'm full of crap.

315
00:21:43,615 --> 00:21:46,460
But now you're thinking
about pizza too--

316
00:21:46,495 --> 00:21:49,265
No cheese, extra olives.

317
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,860
That is some serious
David Blaine trickery, my friend.

318
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,077
I'm telling you,
it's no trick.

319
00:21:56,112 --> 00:21:58,225
And not only
do I have powers,

320
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,305
But they're developing
like gangbusters.

321
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,780
Even on the way over here,
I discovered a new one.

322
00:22:02,815 --> 00:22:06,420
What was this new power,
o puissant one?

323
00:22:06,455 --> 00:22:08,660
You really want
to see it?

324
00:22:08,695 --> 00:22:10,580
Yeah.

325
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,180
( both laugh )

326
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,225
God damn, Les.

327
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,340
That was punk rock,
bro.

328
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,180
And that's just
the tip of the iceberg.

329
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:33,585
The more difficult powers--

330
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:38,180
it seems to exact a slight
physical toll.

331
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,540
So what do you plan on doing
with these awesome powers?

332
00:22:45,575 --> 00:22:49,065
Oh, that's what I wanted to
talk to you guys about, see?

333
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,305
LES ON PHONE: <i>I understand the
need to keep our secret,</i>

334
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:56,500
<i>but stopping that robbery today
was the first time in my whole life</i>

335
00:22:56,535 --> 00:22:58,385
<i>that I've ever felt like...</i>

336
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,945
I could really make
a difference in the world,

337
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,220
like I could do something
that nobody else can do--

338
00:23:03,255 --> 00:23:05,237
something important,

339
00:23:05,272 --> 00:23:07,220
maybe even necessary.

340
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,065
So I talked about it
with my friends

341
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,305
and they agree that if
a person doesn't do good

342
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,740
with the gifts they're given,
well, that's almost worse

343
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:18,860
than doing evil,
isn't it?

344
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,625
I have no idea what
you're talking about, Les.

345
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,380
But if you leave here without
giving me a month's notice,

346
00:23:26,415 --> 00:23:29,540
you can kiss my letter
of recommendation goodbye.

347
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:30,860
I understand.

348
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,180
Did one of those lowlifes
make you feel guilty again?

349
00:23:35,215 --> 00:23:37,385
Is that what this is about?
Because if it is--

350
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:40,420
I'm sorry, Steve, but I've
told you as much as I can.

351
00:23:40,455 --> 00:23:42,460
Excuse me.

352
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,420
LES'S VOICE:
<i>The costume is obviously integral</i>

353
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,865
<i>for any superhero.</i>

354
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,820
<i>It can protect</i>
<i>the hero's true identity,</i>

355
00:24:20,855 --> 00:24:23,097
<i>it can inspire fear,</i>

356
00:24:23,132 --> 00:24:25,340
<i>curiosity or amazement.</i>

357
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:27,505
<i>But in my opinion,</i>

358
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,420
<i>the most important</i>
<i>part of a costume</i>

359
00:24:30,455 --> 00:24:32,065
<i>is what goes</i>
<i>on the back of it.</i>

360
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,980
<i>Because it's not just</i>
<i>the hero's name,</i>

361
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:36,017
<i>it's their message</i>
<i>to the public.</i>

362
00:24:36,052 --> 00:24:37,985
<i>I want my costume</i>
<i>to tell people </i>

363
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,380
<i>that they shouldn't give up no
matter how alone they sometimes feel.</i>

364
00:24:41,415 --> 00:24:43,780
<i>Because anything</i>
<i>is possible.</i>

365
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,300
<i>It turns out that</i>
<i>being a superhero</i>

366
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:55,460
<i>was like many other</i>
<i>things in life:</i>

367
00:25:55,495 --> 00:25:57,585
<i>When you want to avoid it,</i>

368
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,640
<i>crime seems like</i>
<i>it's everywhere,</i>

369
00:25:59,675 --> 00:26:01,727
<i>but when you're</i>
<i>looking for it,</i>

370
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:03,780
<i>crime is nowhere</i>
<i>to be found.</i>

371
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:12,060
<i>That's why you have to learn
to always trust your instincts.</i>

372
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,020
Whoa, Candy,
that had to hurt.

373
00:26:51,055 --> 00:26:52,785
You can say that again,
Chuck.

374
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,220
Now let's take
one more look at it.

375
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,740
If you have any information
about this bizarre local case,

376
00:27:10,775 --> 00:27:14,260
that number again
is 1-800-555-8477.

377
00:27:14,295 --> 00:27:17,665
1-800-555-tips.

378
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,860
Our mad tackler
is caucasian,

379
00:27:19,895 --> 00:27:21,985
approximately
six feet tall,

380
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,300
and is wearing
a white leather suit

381
00:27:24,335 --> 00:27:26,580
with an unexplained symbol
on the back.

382
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,780
I think we have
a problem.

383
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,180
LES'S VOICE:
<i>Before all this happened,</i>

384
00:27:39,215 --> 00:27:41,337
<i>I assumed a superhero</i>
<i>would be free</i>

385
00:27:41,372 --> 00:27:43,425
<i>from everyday fear</i>
<i>and insecurity.</i>

386
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,340
<i>But I'm discovering that</i>
<i>when the costume comes off,</i>

387
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:48,620
<i>some of the most simple</i>
<i>things in life</i>

388
00:27:48,655 --> 00:27:50,580
<i>still feel</i>
<i>the most dangerous.</i>

389
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,260
<i>( footsteps approach )</i>

390
00:27:55,295 --> 00:27:57,340
<i>Hey.</i>

391
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,900
So that was pretty crazy
the other day, huh?

392
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,660
With the guy and
the gun and everything.

393
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,740
But maybe that kind of thing
happens a lot in your line of work.

394
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:25,420
Well, I guess I'll--
I'll see you around.

395
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,065
I'm sorry.

396
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,660
Do you know,
what I wanted to say is--

397
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,540
I wanted to ask you--

398
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,980
I wanted to know if you--

399
00:28:42,015 --> 00:28:45,540
you wanted to have--

400
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,380
you can...
Keep the change.

401
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,020
LES'S VOICE: <i>I suppose the
main point to get across here</i>

402
00:29:20,055 --> 00:29:21,865
<i>is that even with</i>
<i>good instincts,</i>

403
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,300
<i>the life of a crime fighter
takes a small adjustment period.</i>

404
00:29:25,335 --> 00:29:27,300
<i>And even then it's difficult</i>
<i>to understand</i>

405
00:29:27,335 --> 00:29:29,540
<i>exactly what's</i>
<i>going on sometimes.</i>

406
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,500
( tires screech )

407
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,780
<i>That's why I've decided</i>
<i>to pursue</i>

408
00:29:56,815 --> 00:29:58,660
<i>a more conventional</i>
<i>work environment.</i>

409
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:12,385
Excuse me, officer?

410
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,985
I can't tell you
my real name,

411
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,380
- but I used to work here.
- You're a cop?

412
00:30:18,415 --> 00:30:19,625
Pardon me?

413
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,900
No, um, parking enforcement.

414
00:30:22,935 --> 00:30:24,905
<i>But, uh...</i>

415
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,945
that's all in the past.

416
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:30,260
Anyway, there's something
you need to see.

417
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,220
Pretty solid wall, huh?

418
00:30:37,255 --> 00:30:38,380
Yeah.

419
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,660
Or it seems that way
to most people,

420
00:30:40,695 --> 00:30:42,660
but the truth is...

421
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,740
Jesus, Mary, Joseph.

422
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:02,265
I'm not like most people.

423
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,460
- <i>Yeah, I can see that.</i>
- Who can I talk to?

424
00:31:05,495 --> 00:31:06,705
Talk to?

425
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,105
About helping out,

426
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,380
putting this stuff to work.

427
00:31:11,415 --> 00:31:12,985
You know?

428
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,705
Fighting crimes.

429
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,260
<i>I've had some luck</i>
<i>recently,</i>

430
00:31:17,295 --> 00:31:20,417
<i>mostly small stuff--</i>

431
00:31:20,452 --> 00:31:23,540
Shoplifting,
armed robbery.

432
00:31:23,575 --> 00:31:26,025
You're an armed robber?

433
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,640
No, I stop crimes,
officer.

434
00:31:28,675 --> 00:31:31,127
Convenience-store
stuff mostly.

435
00:31:31,162 --> 00:31:33,580
But I think I'm ready
to move up.

436
00:31:33,615 --> 00:31:36,420
You know,
I've heard of you.

437
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,580
<i>I was thinking</i>
<i>we could...</i>

438
00:31:40,615 --> 00:31:43,060
<i>develop some sort</i>
<i>of signal.</i>

439
00:31:43,095 --> 00:31:44,745
You know?

440
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,020
It doesn't have to be as
complicated as the bat signal.

441
00:31:47,055 --> 00:31:49,737
In the meantime,

442
00:31:49,772 --> 00:31:51,936
here's my card.

443
00:31:51,971 --> 00:31:54,100
Take one of those.

444
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,505
<i>Pager number on it.</i>
<i>You--</i>

445
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,620
You give me a call
anytime you need something

446
00:31:59,655 --> 00:32:01,985
and I'll be right there.

447
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,580
Actually, I think I've got
something for you right now.

448
00:32:04,615 --> 00:32:06,705
Really?

449
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:10,340
There's this loon going around
tackling innocent people.

450
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:11,980
Right?

451
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,420
MAN:
<i>Get in, Les.</i>

452
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,340
Crazy metermaids.

453
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:47,780
That was exciting.

454
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,940
You have a genuine flair for
making a scene, don't you, Les?

455
00:32:52,975 --> 00:32:56,020
<i>Maybe you're trying to</i>
<i>get on television again,</i>

456
00:32:56,055 --> 00:32:58,660
maybe something national
this time.

457
00:32:58,695 --> 00:33:00,100
Who are you?

458
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,465
My name is Jonas Exiler.

459
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,580
And this is my brother
Theodore.

460
00:33:07,615 --> 00:33:10,705
Maybe you know us
as the...

461
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,020
people whose dreams you're
trying to flush down the toilet.

462
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,380
We've spent the last
five years of our lives

463
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:20,465
and every penny
we've ever saved

464
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,900
trying to get this company
off the ground, Les.

465
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,780
It's been an uphill battle,

466
00:33:25,815 --> 00:33:28,220
<i>Believe me.</i>

467
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,900
You're telepathic too?

468
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,820
You're a deeply troubled
individual, aren't you, buddy?

469
00:33:38,855 --> 00:33:43,105
We want to help you, Les.
Can you understand that?

470
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,220
You have to realize that
the reaction that you're having

471
00:33:45,255 --> 00:33:46,865
<i>is a complete anomaly.</i>

472
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,780
<i>And really, there's no proof</i>
<i>the special is responsible</i>

473
00:33:49,815 --> 00:33:51,665
<i>for anything</i>
<i>you're feeling right now.</i>

474
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,060
<i>You could just be experiencing</i>
<i>some sort of unrelated...</i>

475
00:33:54,095 --> 00:33:55,700
<i>( voice fades out )</i>

476
00:33:55,735 --> 00:33:57,460
What?

477
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,545
Fucking hell.

478
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,105
I-- I can't do that.

479
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:08,560
Can you understand anything
we're trying to tell you, Les?

480
00:34:08,595 --> 00:34:11,980
- I will never join you.
- The medication is making you sick.

481
00:34:12,015 --> 00:34:13,425
All you have to do

482
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,385
is stop taking
the medication.

483
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,800
And stop running around
in that silly suit.

484
00:34:18,835 --> 00:34:21,145
- That's all we're asking here.
- Never.

485
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,660
We could sue you to hell and
back for running around on TV

486
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:25,665
wearing our logo.
You understand that, right?

487
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,420
But we'd just as soon avoid any
negative publicity right now.

488
00:34:28,455 --> 00:34:31,420
Just stop taking the pills.

489
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,660
We can put all this
behind us.

490
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,380
Well, then we have
a problem...

491
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,825
- Don't we?
- <i>( faint beeping )</i>

492
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,100
- Because the way I see it--
- Who are you?

493
00:34:52,135 --> 00:34:54,237
I come from the future

494
00:34:54,272 --> 00:34:55,966
that will no longer exist.

495
00:34:56,001 --> 00:34:57,625
Who is he talking to now?

496
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,680
These are the men
that convinced the police

497
00:35:00,715 --> 00:35:03,700
- that you did something wrong.
- Of course.

498
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:05,585
Les?

499
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,825
Earth to Les.

500
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:12,020
They designed the drug to build
an army of unstoppable assassins.

501
00:35:12,055 --> 00:35:13,825
And if you won't work
for them,

502
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,780
they'll try to
strip you of your powers.

503
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,785
- Or worse.
- Worse?

504
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,260
- Much worse.
- I told you this was a bad idea.

505
00:35:24,295 --> 00:35:25,905
<i>But don't worry...</i>

506
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,545
Because I won't
let that happen.

507
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,340
- Let's just take him to the E.R.
- The E.R.?

508
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:34,620
- Are you crazy--
- No!

509
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,660
Ow.

510
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,140
( tires screech )

511
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,740
Don't just stare at him.

512
00:35:53,775 --> 00:35:55,140
Get him.

513
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,660
Ahhh!

514
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,740

Not much oxygen inside,
is there?

518
00:37:01,055 --> 00:37:02,865
Ahh!

519
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,940
You should have joined us
when you had the chance.

520
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,105
Your force field is good,

521
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,620
but my teleporting
is better.

522
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,460
<i>( psychedelic rock</i>
<i>playing )</i>

523
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,945
- ( electric buzzing )
- Yes!

524
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,540
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, you love that shit.

525
00:37:56,575 --> 00:37:58,265
Whoo!
Ha ha!

526
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,865
- Oh, shit.
- Fucking game.

527
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,720
This is the best game
ever invent--

528
00:38:01,755 --> 00:38:03,505
Les! Les,
man, what's going on?

529
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,500
Yeah, man, Antoine said he saw
you on the idiot box or something.

530
00:38:06,535 --> 00:38:08,180
- Bad outfit, by the way.
- Oh, yeah.

531
00:38:08,215 --> 00:38:10,025
Do you--
do you know him?

532
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,785
Yeah, he comes in here
sometimes.

533
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,740
- Are you okay?
- I'm good. How are you?

534
00:38:13,775 --> 00:38:15,625
Yeah, I'm good.
Listen, we have to talk.

535
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,420
<i>What's up?</i>

536
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:18,700
After I started using
my powers to help people,

537
00:38:18,735 --> 00:38:20,585
these two brothers
in suits showed up.

538
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,540
And since I wouldn't join them,
they're trying to destroy me.

539
00:38:23,575 --> 00:38:25,145
- What?
- Yeah.

540
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,660
And I think they might have
some control over the news media

541
00:38:27,695 --> 00:38:29,545
and maybe
even the police.

542
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,705
Yeah, because when I
came back from the future,

543
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:35,580
they managed to frame me for
crimes that I didn't commit.

544
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,780
You're serious about this,
aren't you?

545
00:38:39,815 --> 00:38:41,980
Of course.

546
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,865
Uh-- uh, I'm sorry.

547
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,140
<i>Um, I'm sorry, everybody, but
we're closing up early today.</i>

548
00:38:49,175 --> 00:38:51,060
<i>You gotta go.</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

549
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,460
But I want to buy this.

550
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,340
Flamethrower defeats the eye
in a prolonged and bloody battle

551
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,345
wherein we learn that
the woolian's death

552
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,340
was a complex Morovian
subterfuge, okay, buddy?

553
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,740
- Get the fuck out.
- Sorry, man. Come back tomorrow.

554
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,105
- Listen, Les...
- <i>Les?</i>

555
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:09,020
Hey, no no no.
You could shut those, Everett.

556
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,820
Shut that.

557
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,865
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Les? Les, Les,

558
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,180
- The thing is, man--
- You don't have super-powers.

559
00:39:19,215 --> 00:39:21,585
No no.
What do you mean?

560
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,140
We just thought you were
screwing around with us, you know?

561
00:39:24,175 --> 00:39:26,177
But you saw the thing
with the wall-- you saw that.

562
00:39:26,212 --> 00:39:28,180
- You mean you running into it?
- You mean through it.

563
00:39:28,215 --> 00:39:29,980
- I mean into it.
- You mean through it!

564
00:39:30,015 --> 00:39:33,220
Les, we were just
really high.

565
00:39:33,255 --> 00:39:35,025
Jesus, Les,

566
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,060
What happened
to you, man?

567
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,945
Okay, you guys.
Okay, you got me.

568
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,305
But this is no time
for fooling around.

569
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,700
You know, we have to figure
out what to do about the suits.

570
00:39:53,735 --> 00:39:55,477
There are no suits, Les.
There's no suits,

571
00:39:55,512 --> 00:39:57,185
- there's no super-powers--
- And Les,

572
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,265
Les, you know you're our bro
no matter what, man, but--

573
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,980
You're losing your mind, man.
You're losing your fucking mind.

574
00:40:02,015 --> 00:40:04,017
Really?
If I don't have powers,

575
00:40:04,052 --> 00:40:06,020
then how do you
explain this?

576
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,860
Explain what?

577
00:40:08,895 --> 00:40:10,780
This.

578
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,345
You can't see this, Joey?

579
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,380
You're just reaching
your arms out.

580
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:17,900
You honestly
can't see this?

581
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,060
I don't know what
I'm supposed to see--

582
00:40:21,095 --> 00:40:22,465
- Joey!
- Les,

583
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,700
I don't know what
I'm supposed to see.

584
00:40:24,735 --> 00:40:26,905
Everett?

585
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,300
Les, man,
I can do it too.

586
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,380
Okay.

587
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,945
They must have--

588
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,860
They must have
already got to you.

589
00:40:50,895 --> 00:40:53,060
Who got to us, Les?

590
00:40:53,095 --> 00:40:54,385
The suits!

591
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,265
The suits-- they know
that you're my friends,

592
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,500
so they must have put you
in some sort of mind shield

593
00:41:00,535 --> 00:41:03,060
so that you can't
see my powers.

594
00:41:03,095 --> 00:41:06,265
Mmm.
It's genius.

595
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,460
No no no, Les, Les,
it's totally--

596
00:41:08,495 --> 00:41:10,625
Crazy! Crazy, right?

597
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,940
They want me to think
that I'm going crazy.

598
00:41:13,975 --> 00:41:15,505
Les--

599
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,900
That's how they
like it.

600
00:41:16,935 --> 00:41:19,265
Les, Les...

601
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,380
I think we might need to
get you some medical attention.

602
00:41:22,415 --> 00:41:25,500
Is there a doctor or someone
we could take you to?

603
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,140
That's a good idea.

604
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,140
Do you really think
he's taking--

605
00:41:57,175 --> 00:41:59,060
taking us to
a real doctor...

606
00:41:59,095 --> 00:42:01,100
Or just an imaginary one?

607
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,345
Don't worry.

608
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,700
Dr. Dobson will
explain everything.

609
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,020
- Stop the car!
- <i>( slams on brakes )</i>

610
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:19,100
- What the hell?
- Where'd he go?

611
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,980
There he is.

612
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,505
Les!

613
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,940
What are you doing, man?
Get down from there.

614
00:42:27,975 --> 00:42:30,340
Somebody stole my purse!
He stole my purse.

615
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:32,260
- Don't worry, ma'am.
- No!

616
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,040
I've got it.

617
00:42:40,075 --> 00:42:41,740
Thank you.

618
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,865
Ma'am,
in the future,

619
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,100
please be careful walking
around this neighborhood

620
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,800
after dark.

621
00:42:48,835 --> 00:42:50,460
I will.

622
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,700
It's like a move
straight out of "Urban War."

623
00:42:58,735 --> 00:43:00,237
You just-- booyah!

624
00:43:00,272 --> 00:43:01,705
Quit encouraging him.

625
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,105
You could have seriously
messed yourself up, dude.

626
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,860
Why is it so hard for you to
believe that I have special powers?

627
00:43:06,895 --> 00:43:09,740
Special powers?
Are you listening to yourself?

628
00:43:09,775 --> 00:43:11,545
People don't have
special powers.

629
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,545
- I believe you, Les.
- No, you don't.

630
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,820
Yes, I do. How else could
he have done what he did?

631
00:43:15,855 --> 00:43:17,545
- It was awesome.
- It was stupid.

632
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,820
You wouldn't recognize a miracle
if it bit you in your ass.

633
00:43:19,855 --> 00:43:21,997
- A miracle?
- Yes, a miracle.

634
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:24,105
Miracles don't exist,
Joey.

635
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:27,980
You have become such a
downer lately, you know that?

636
00:43:28,015 --> 00:43:29,825
Look, Les,

637
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:33,420
You're part of a very small
group of people on this earth

638
00:43:33,455 --> 00:43:35,437
I actually give
a shit about, okay?

639
00:43:35,472 --> 00:43:37,646
Not because you got
special powers,

640
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:39,785
but because-- well,
because you're you.

641
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:42,700
So I just can't fucking handle you
trying to kill yourself right now, okay?

642
00:43:42,735 --> 00:43:44,537
Can you understand that?

643
00:43:44,572 --> 00:43:46,305
Yes, I can, Everett.

644
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,020
You can doubt my powers
all you want,

645
00:43:49,055 --> 00:43:51,700
but you're about
to discover the truth.

646
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,060
Dr. Dobson?

647
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,385
Can I help you?

648
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:09,240
It's okay.
We can trust them.

649
00:44:09,275 --> 00:44:12,060
Is this man
a friend of yours?

650
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,905
You're not his doctor?

651
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,740
<i>For some</i>
<i>inexplicable reason,</i>

652
00:44:17,775 --> 00:44:19,545
he seems to be
under that impression.

653
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:22,420
<i>He came around the other day</i>
<i>claiming to be part</i>

654
00:44:22,455 --> 00:44:24,065
of a medical study
we're conducting.

655
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,200
No no, we don't have time
for all this secrecy.

656
00:44:26,235 --> 00:44:28,367
Okay? The suits, they already
know about my powers

657
00:44:28,402 --> 00:44:30,500
and they somehow--
they brainwashed my friends.

658
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,505
Okay? You have to
tell them everything.

659
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,420
I'm sorry, young man, but if
you come around here again,

660
00:44:38,455 --> 00:44:40,277
I'll be forced
to call security.

661
00:44:40,312 --> 00:44:42,100
That won't be
necessary, sir.

662
00:44:42,135 --> 00:44:43,737
No, it's okay.

663
00:44:43,772 --> 00:44:45,305
We have to go.

664
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:48,020
No! You have to warn them.
You have to tell them--

665
00:44:48,055 --> 00:44:50,225
you have to tell them
about the suits.

666
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:53,820
Okay? They're after me. They could be
after all of us. These are my friends.

667
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:56,980
I don't have any idea what
you're talking about, young man.

668
00:44:57,015 --> 00:44:58,905
- The suits!
- Don't worry about the suits, Les.

669
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,100
- It's gonna be okay. Let's go.
- You don't understand!

670
00:45:01,135 --> 00:45:03,660
Okay, they're very--
they're very powerful.

671
00:45:03,695 --> 00:45:05,740
They're very--
they're scary people.

672
00:45:05,775 --> 00:45:07,785
That's why he's
packing up.

673
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:10,540
Okay? That's why
he's scared, because--

674
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:12,500
see, he's running away,
you see?

675
00:45:12,535 --> 00:45:14,545
<i>He's running away.</i>

676
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:18,065
I suspect your friend has ingested
some relatively harmless narcotic.

677
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:21,860
Have him drink this. It'll help clean
any residual chemicals in his system

678
00:45:21,895 --> 00:45:23,505
before it's absorbed
in his bloodstream.

679
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,660
Wait about six hours or so.
If he doesn't seem any better,

680
00:45:25,695 --> 00:45:27,620
take him to
the Emergency Room. Okay?

681
00:45:27,655 --> 00:45:29,105
Okay.

682
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:31,060
- Ahh!
- No no no no no.

683
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:33,197
<i>Hee! Huh?</i>

684
00:45:33,232 --> 00:45:35,286
What is this?

685
00:45:35,321 --> 00:45:37,305
The antidote?

686
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:40,065
This is the antidote,
isn't it?

687
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,785
Drinking this will
take away my powers?

688
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,825
No no, it's gonna
strengthen your powers, Les.

689
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:48,420
Les, if you drink that, man,
it's gonna strengthen your powers.

690
00:45:48,455 --> 00:45:51,105
Yeah yeah yeah.
Les Les, please. Please.

691
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,420
- Just take it. It's not a big deal.
- You think I'm stupid?

692
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,460
- No, Les--
- You think I don't know what's going on?

693
00:45:55,495 --> 00:45:57,225
No, I know that
you know what's--

694
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,220
- You don't know what's going on.
- We have to go, Les.

695
00:45:59,255 --> 00:46:00,977
You're the one who doesn't
know what's going on.

696
00:46:01,012 --> 00:46:02,700
- No, I do know--
- You don't know what's going on.

697
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:05,820
Okay? You're the one
who doesn't have a clue.

698
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:08,545
I have a clue.
Not you, me.

699
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,900
Come on, man, let him go.
You're scaring the shit out of him.

700
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:13,140
Sorry, Les.

701
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,180
Haa!

702
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:33,980
<i>( dog barking )</i>

703
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:44,260
<i>( distant</i>
<i>siren wails )</i>

704
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,065
JONAS:
<i>Get this one:</i>

705
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,820
"I saw a piece of shit on
the sidewalk the other day--

706
00:46:50,855 --> 00:46:54,305
not dog-shit,
but from a person

707
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:55,985
<i>and it made me</i>
<i>feel so hopeless,</i>

708
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:59,300
not just for whoever went there,
but for every person on the planet,

709
00:46:59,335 --> 00:47:01,460
if you know what I mean."

710
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,980
I told you he was a basketcase
before he ever came to us.

711
00:47:07,015 --> 00:47:08,865
<i>Put that down,</i>
<i>please.</i>

712
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,660
<i>Help me look</i>
<i>for the pills.</i>

713
00:47:10,695 --> 00:47:12,385
<i>Forget</i>
<i>about the pills.</i>

714
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,580
<i>What do you mean,</i>
<i>forget about the pills?</i>

715
00:47:14,615 --> 00:47:16,580
I say we wait for him
to come home,

716
00:47:16,615 --> 00:47:19,260
we knock the fucker out...

717
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:23,020
tie him up for
a few days

718
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:25,100
<i>and wait for</i>
<i>his powers to go away.</i>

719
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,880
<i>What do you say?</i>

720
00:47:26,915 --> 00:47:28,620
You can't be serious.

721
00:47:28,655 --> 00:47:30,025
Why not?

722
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:33,340
We're not dealing with the
kind of people we're used to.

723
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:36,620
This kind of guy could disappear
off the face of the earth

724
00:47:36,655 --> 00:47:38,637
for a few days,

725
00:47:38,672 --> 00:47:40,620
Nobody would care.

726
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:45,180
<i>Nobody would</i>
<i>even notice.</i>

727
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:51,180
No no no no no,
I am out.

728
00:47:51,215 --> 00:47:53,225
I don't care anymore.

729
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,820
This kid's gonna get hurt
running around in that state.

730
00:47:55,855 --> 00:47:57,825
So what if
we lose everything?

731
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:00,460
At least I can get back to
getting some sleep at night.

732
00:48:00,495 --> 00:48:02,585
Well, excuse me
for not giving a crap,

733
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:05,180
but I can't seem to muster up
any sympathy for you right now.

734
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,180
<i>( car beeps )</i>

735
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:12,340
Ahh!

736
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,460
Remember me now,
Dobson?

737
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,420
- <i>( lights hum )</i>
- Leave 'em off.

738
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,340
I said off!

739
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,900
You didn't really think you could
get away this easily, did you?

740
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:33,905
Huh?

741
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:36,140
Okay, turn on
the lights.

742
00:48:36,175 --> 00:48:38,340
<i>Not the overhead one!</i>

743
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,860
This one.

744
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,705
Don't try anything funny.

745
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:48,465
You understand me?
Don't do it.

746
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,380
You're not gonna find
your file there.

747
00:48:51,415 --> 00:48:52,785
I don't believe you
anymore.

748
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:54,940
I don't believe anything you say.
You're a liar.

749
00:48:54,975 --> 00:48:56,660
They made me shred it.

750
00:48:56,695 --> 00:48:57,905
Yeah, right.

751
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:00,340
Listen, Les, I'm very
sorry for everything--

752
00:49:00,341 --> 00:49:00,660
Ha!

753
00:49:00,695 --> 00:49:03,820
Ha! Ha!
So you admit knowing me?

754
00:49:03,855 --> 00:49:05,145
Of course I know you.

755
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:07,940
You're working for
the suits, aren't you?

756
00:49:07,975 --> 00:49:10,020
Maybe you should
take a seat.

757
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:19,540
No, I'm fine standing.

758
00:49:19,575 --> 00:49:21,277
Can I sit down?

759
00:49:21,312 --> 00:49:23,066
You sit down.

760
00:49:23,101 --> 00:49:24,820
You sit down.

761
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:32,820
You have to understand
how much time and energy

762
00:49:32,855 --> 00:49:35,380
I put into developing
this medication.

763
00:49:35,415 --> 00:49:38,017
It became my whole life.

764
00:49:38,052 --> 00:49:40,620
- When?
- Pardon me?

765
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,785
When did you turn on me?

766
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:47,785
We tested Specioprin
on thousands of subjects,

767
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:51,220
but you were the first and only one
to have an adverse reaction like this.

768
00:49:51,255 --> 00:49:53,665
No, but this is not
an adverse reaction.

769
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,940
You wanted me to feel better.
You told me that.

770
00:49:55,975 --> 00:49:58,065
- You wanted this to happen.
- No.

771
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:02,140
A few weeks ago, we got an offer--
that's what I wanted to happen.

772
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:04,340
What do you mean, offer?

773
00:50:04,375 --> 00:50:06,065
To buy us out--

774
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,305
The drug,
all our research,

775
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,580
the whole operation was
going to be absorbed

776
00:50:10,615 --> 00:50:13,425
by a sizeable corporation.
That's--

777
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:17,600
( laughs )
--that's what we worked all this time for.

778
00:50:17,635 --> 00:50:21,740
We were afraid that your
results would scare them off.

779
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:28,345
So this is--

780
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,785
This is about money?

781
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:33,360
We've done a terrible
injustice to you, Les,

782
00:50:33,395 --> 00:50:35,900
And there's nothing
I can do about it now.

783
00:50:35,935 --> 00:50:38,625
But I've told
my partners I'm out.

784
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,540
And I'll confirm your story
should you decide to

785
00:50:41,575 --> 00:50:44,225
take legal action.
And if you ask me,

786
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:46,580
you'll have a very strong
case against all of us.

787
00:50:46,615 --> 00:50:49,905
But, Les,
it's very important

788
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:52,420
that we get the medication
out of your system.

789
00:50:52,455 --> 00:50:54,145
- No. Never.
- <i>Yes.</i>

790
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,500
I'll never let you
take my powers away.

791
00:50:56,535 --> 00:50:58,985
Give me the pills, Les.
Les!

792
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:02,460
No no! Come on, spit 'em out.
Spit 'em out, Les.

793
00:51:02,495 --> 00:51:04,740
Spit 'em out.
Come on, spit 'em out.

794
00:51:04,775 --> 00:51:06,620
Les!

795
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,425
You can never take
my powers away--

796
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:13,100
You can never-- you can never turn
me back into the person I used to be.

797
00:51:13,135 --> 00:51:15,340
Nobody can!
Nobody can.

798
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:34,180
So, nice to
see you again.

799
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,985
You don't scare me
anymore.

800
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:41,220
Good. Then why don't you get
in and we can have a nice talk?

801
00:51:41,255 --> 00:51:44,265
You can't stop me now.
I'm too powerful.

802
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,860
I'm not the kind of man
who takes kindly to threats--

803
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:49,260
I know exactly
what kind of man you are.

804
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:54,780
I've been dealing with guys
like you my whole life.

805
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,380
You think you're
so much more important

806
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,100
than everyone else,

807
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:07,260
that you can do whatever
you want to whoever you want.

808
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:10,300
Who do you think would care
if you disappeared?

809
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,800
Who would care
about that, huh?

810
00:52:14,835 --> 00:52:17,025
Who would care about
that, huh?

811
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:19,940
Do you think that anyone
would actually care

812
00:52:19,975 --> 00:52:22,020
if you disappeared?

813
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,580
Pardon me?

814
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,740
What the hell
is he doing now?

815
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:46,425
This is no time
for Tai Chi, Les.

816
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:49,860
We're willing to negotiate
a very fair deal with you.

817
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,860
Try to make me disappear?

818
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:09,540
I'll make you disappear.

819
00:53:09,575 --> 00:53:11,540
Huh?

820
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:16,820

<i>He's too powerful!</i>

00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:37,660
<i>about the problems associated</i>
<i>with being a superhero.</i>

876
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:39,865

877

<i>the more glamorous aspects</i>
<i>of our lives.</i>

878

<i>the things we can do</i>
<i>that no one else can.</i>

Oh.

902
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:21,020
What kind of drugs
did you take?

903
00:59:21,055 --> 00:59:22,425
Pills.

904
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:26,260

Yeah.

907
00:59:30,581 --> 00:59:32,665
Okay.

908

g-g-g-get you some help.

911
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:46,900
Tell me one thing,
please.

912
00:59:46,935 --> 00:59:49,545
What is it?

913
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:51,820
Does this place

I got rid of 'em all.

The pills?

917
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:10,185
Just--
no, the suits.

918
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:13,420
The suits, they-- they
wouldn't leave me alone.

919
01:00:13,455 --> 01:00:15,437
They wouldn't,

920
01:00:15,472 --> 01:00:17,420
so I had to do it.

921
01:00:17,455 --> 01:00:19,580
I did.

922
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:26,460

hurt someone?

- What's wrong?

925
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:34,025
Nothing.

926
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:36,940
I think there's--
there's a strong possibility

927
01:00:36,975 --> 01:00:39,237
that I'm losing my mind.

928
01:00:39,272 --> 01:00:41,500

I'm losing my mind.

01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,060
<i>I'm standing right here.</i>

932
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,940
Aren't you gonna
finish me off?

933
01:00:52,975 --> 01:00:56,020
It-- it's okay.

934
01:00:56,055 --> 01:00:58,425
Shh.

935
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:00,905
Everything's gonna
be okay.

936
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:04,180
Does this door lock
from the outside?

937
01:01:04,215 --> 01:01:06,185
Oh, I-- I think so.

938
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:09,265
Can you-- can you
lock me in here?

939
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,820
That doesn't sound like
a very good idea.

940
01:01:11,855 --> 01:01:13,917
Please, I'm not safe
to be around.

941
01:01:13,952 --> 01:01:15,980

Please.

947
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:36,140
You have to lock it
from out there.

948

Uh, hold your horses.

949
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:55,500

through till morning.
