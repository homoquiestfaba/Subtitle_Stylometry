melted the washer.

for fall time
with the <i>AUKXII,</i>

was about 14 seconds.

Go ahead, Homer.

Now, that fire was near Welch,
just under three miles
from our launchpad.

1040
01:15:57,986 --> 01:16:02,616
And at the time of the fire,
the best that we could do
was 1.2 miles...

1041
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:05,319
which is exactly where we found
that rocket, Mr. Turner.

1042
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:09,626
<i>See, Mr. Turner, that rocket</i>
<i>fell for about 14 seconds,</i>
<i>which means...</i>

1043
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:12,360
that it flew to an altitude
of 3,000 feet...

1044
01:16:12,434 --> 01:16:14,994
<i>according to the equation...</i>

1045
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:18,471

"T" squared...

<i>"A"is the gravity constant...</i>
<i>or 32...</i>

1047
01:16:22,177 --> 01:16:24,805
and "T" is the time
it took for that rocket
to come back down.

<i>Velocity equals</i>
<i>acceleration times time.</i>

[Clears Throat]

1283
01:36:10,464 --> 01:36:12,955
Hey, everybody, can we have
your attention, please?

1284
01:36:13,033 --> 01:36:15,024
Come on, Homer,
let her fly!

1285
01:36:15,102 --> 01:36:18,731
We're gonna launch the rocket
in a minute, but we'd like
to say thank you first.

1286
01:36:18,806 --> 01:36:23,209
If it wasn't for y'all,
we'd never have gotten
into any science fair.

1287
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:26,144
We'd probably never have
gotten past blowin' up
my mom's fence.

1288
01:36:26,213 --> 01:36:28,579
[Laughing]
But we did...

1289
01:36:28,649 --> 01:36:32,210
because of your help
and support.

1290
01:36:32,286 --> 01:36:34,720
And this is for Coalwood.

1291
01:36:39,727 --> 01:36:43,493
There are a few people
who believed in us
even before we did.

1292
01:36:43,564 --> 01:36:47,159
We'd like to dedicate
this rocket to them.

1293
01:36:47,234 --> 01:36:49,759
To Ike Bykovsky.

1294
01:36:52,740 --> 01:36:55,732
To Mr. Bolden,
who helped us so much.

1295
01:36:58,345 --> 01:37:01,337
To the person
who first inspired us,

1296
01:37:01,415 --> 01:37:03,849
our teacher, Miss Riley.

1297
01:37:05,953 --> 01:37:11,186
And, finally, I'd like
to dedicate this rocket
to my mom and to...

1298
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:18,264
my dad.

1299
01:37:33,047 --> 01:37:37,108
You know, it, uh, won't fly
unless somebody pushes
the button.

1300
01:37:40,354 --> 01:37:42,481
It's yours,
if you want it.

1301
01:38:05,646 --> 01:38:08,809
Ten, nine...
[Together]
Eight,

1302
01:38:08,883 --> 01:38:11,477
<i>seven, six, five,</i>

1303
01:38:11,552 --> 01:38:15,283
four, three, two, one.

1304
01:38:31,705 --> 01:38:35,835
Look at it go, Homer.
This one's gonna go for miles.

1305
01:44:47,147 --> 01:44:51,413
<i>#Many a tear</i>

1306
01:44:53,153 --> 01:44:56,020
