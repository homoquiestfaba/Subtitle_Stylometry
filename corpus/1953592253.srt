1
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,459
<i>Goat Man took me
on my first trek when I was 11.</i>

2
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,088
<i>Not long after that,
he taught me how to do bong hits.</i>

3
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,049
<i>It doesn't matter
where we go on these treks.</i>

4
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,509
<i>We just wander.</i>

5
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,805
<i>Goat Man says it's
the journey that counts.</i>

6
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,640
<i>Which I know is cliché.</i>

7
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:46,021
<i>In a few days, I leave
for the prep school my father went to.</i>

8
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,359
<i>Goat Man's calling this my "farewell trek."</i>

9
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:53,987
<i>He says I should soak up as much
of the Sonoran sun as I can.</i>

10
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,782
<i>But he's the one doing
most of the soaking.</i>

11
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,875
You won't have all this at Gates Academy.

12
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,088
Naked men shouldn't squat.

13
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,885
Do you ever worry about your parents?

14
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,348
Did you ever?

15
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,599
No.

16
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,018
Not really.

17
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,188
Wendy will be fine.

18
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,190
I'll watch her.

19
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,700
<i>Goat Man once told me
that in certain Native American tribes,</i>

20
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,911
<i>an elder leads a young man out
into the wilderness to fend for himself</i>

21
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,538
<i>until he has a vision.</i>

22
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,374
She never lets me milk her.

23
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,336
<i>In one tribe, if no vision comes
they'll chop off a fingertip</i>

24
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,755
<i>and sacrifice it to the Great Spirit.</i>

25
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,923
Thanks.

26
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,551
<i>Goat Man says I'm not quite ready
for this rite of passage.</i>

27
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,428
Sorry I messed up the trek, Goat Man.

28
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,762
It's not your fault.

29
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,327
I should have never let you
come out here with brand new boots.

30
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,034
I should have oiled them
and let you walk around in them

31
00:03:06,077 --> 00:03:08,453
for a couple days before coming out here.

32
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,441
<i>Goat Man was my parents' friend first.</i>

33
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,531
<i>My mother claims
she can't remember how they met,</i>

34
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,281
<i>but Goat Man told me
he used to sell them peyote.</i>

35
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,950
<i>At one point Goat Man was broke,</i>

36
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:25,287
<i>so in exchange for cleaning the pool
and taking care of the landscaping,</i>

37
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,289
<i>they let him live in our pool house.</i>

38
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,625
<i>When I was a baby, my father left</i>

39
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,460
<i>and Goat Man stayed.</i>

40
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,642
<i>My mom hasn't paid
a bill in her entire life.</i>

41
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,976
<i>Yet somehow she always knows</i>

42
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,646
<i>how much money she has in her trust fund.</i>

43
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:55,817
Ten more minutes.

44
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,656
I'm going away to school, Frieda.

45
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:03,784
I need you to listen
to Goat Man while I'm gone.

46
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,258
<i>This is my neighbor Aubrey.</i>

47
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,342
<i>She's hot, yes,</i>

48
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,011
<i>but at the risk
of sounding like a misogynist...</i>

49
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,346
I see you, Ellis!

50
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,306
What, are you jacking off back there?

51
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,016
<i>...she's sort of a rancid bitch.</i>

52
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,851
No, Frieda just stopped to eat.

53
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,187
- That's a goat.
- You're so dead!

54
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,275
Pervert!

55
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,613
Ignore the pain.

56
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,908
Luckily, her meatheaded boyfriend
was barefoot.

57
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,662
Messed up feet and
a big cut on your forehead.

58
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,414
Not a very good send off.

59
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,167
Thanks, Goat Man.

60
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,045
Are you packed yet?

61
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,214
Yeah, I finished this morning.

62
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,174
I prepared a bag of buds for you.

63
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,720
That shit'll cream your spinach.

64
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,097
Ever heard of security checks?

65
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,058
I'll mail it to you.

66
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,813
My roommate better be cool.

67
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,608
He could have the best weed
on the East Coast.

68
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,029
Probably a Facebook addict with halitosis.

69
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,245
My boy's leaving me tomorrow.

70
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:34,916
Leaving me for the big bad world
of Gates Academy.

71
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,711
Ellis, your feet are all red!

72
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,921
From my new hiking boots.

73
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,966
Figures Fucker Frank would send you
third-rate hiking boots.

74
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:46,595
- Tightwad.
- Those are, like, $300 boots from Italy.

75
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,929
I wish I had a pair.

76
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,890
That's not good parenting.

77
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,572
He should try calling
you once in a while,

78
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,268
at least pretend to care.

79
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,229
I ordered you 14 Oxford shirts.

80
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,981
You'll barely ever have to do laundry.

81
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,066
- Okay?
- Thanks.

82
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,276
Not to mention everything else
that I bought you.

83
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,028
I appreciate it.

84
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,198
You don't have to leave, you know.

85
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,283
You can still change your mind.

86
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,328
You act like I'm going off to war.

87
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,663
You don't get it, do you?
You don't get it.

88
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,500
- I'm sad.
- You still have me.

89
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,001
Jav!

90
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,297
I paid 700 extra to the electric company,

91
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,510
so you won't have to worry about that
for another three months.

92
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:29,638
All the other bills are paid,
and I renewed the insurance on the Volvo.

93
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,265
You don't even know
how much I'm going to miss you.

94
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,644
You don't know. You don't know.
You don't know.

95
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,357
I'm gonna miss you, too.

96
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,776
A lot.

97
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:08,885
Mom.

98
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,222
My flight's in two hours.

99
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,651
<i>The white zone is for</i>

100
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,195
<i>immediate loading
and unloading of passengers...</i>

101
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,363
You don't have to wait.

102
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,157
My flight's not, like, for another hour.

103
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,908
- You sure?
- Yeah.

104
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,804
Go on.
The goats are roasting in there.

105
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,495
I'll be fine.

106
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,789
You take care of Wendy, all right?

107
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,792
- I'll call you once I get there...
- Don't worry.

108
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,551
Many rivers to cross, partner.

109
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,474
Bye, guys.
Be good.

110
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,602
- I think Frieda ate a map.
- Bullshit.

111
00:07:58,686 --> 00:07:59,769
Frieda!

112
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,063
Damn it.

113
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,590
<i>Wendy has referred to my father
as "Fucker Frank"</i>

114
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,592
<i>for as long as I can remember.</i>

115
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,502
<i>So you can imagine her reaction
when I told her</i>

116
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:34,971
<i>I had secretly applied
and was accepted here,</i>

117
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,098
<i>the same prep school he went to.</i>

118
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,603
So I heard this story
about this guy who went to Berkeley,

119
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,338
and every night when
he would go to sleep,

120
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,131
he would wake up
and his ass would be sore.

121
00:08:45,174 --> 00:08:47,416
So after three months of this,
'cause it got really bad,

122
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:50,236
he decided to go to the doctor
and try to find out what's going on.

123
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,005
And the doctor said, "Well, have you
been having any anal sex lately?

124
00:08:53,048 --> 00:08:55,491
"Because that's what it looks like
your ass has been doing."

125
00:08:55,575 --> 00:08:58,410
And the guy's like, "No, no. I'm straight.
Why would I be doing that?"

126
00:08:58,453 --> 00:09:01,533
So the guy calls the cops to see if they
can maybe figure out what's going on,

127
00:09:01,581 --> 00:09:02,957
and it turns out that his roommate

128
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,161
was knocking him out
with colorform every single night

129
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,727
and butt fucking him.
Crazy, right?

130
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,296
Can I hang this on the door?

131
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,346
You must be Barney Cannel.

132
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,098
Yes, sir.

133
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,977
I was hoping Wilt Chamberlain there
was Barney Cannel.

134
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,186
How tall are you, son?

135
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,313
I was 5'10" last time I checked.

136
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,650
- I'm out of shape, though.
- Get in shape. Run for us.

137
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,860
I don't think I'd be any good.

138
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,405
Come on, don't tell me
you're not going to play any sports.

139
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,290
I haven't really thought about it.

140
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,508
Well, think about it.

141
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,536
Dough boy,
we practice every day from 3:00 to 4:00.

142
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,997
You miss two, you're off the team.

143
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,498
Yes, sir.

144
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,745
Where are you going to go to college?

145
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:50,205
My brother Todd, he goes to Yale.

146
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,840
That's where I'm going.
Yale.

147
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,260
- Are you serious?
- Is that guy homeless?

148
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,762
No.
He's a botanist.

149
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,723
And a goat trekker.

150
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,725
Is he your dad?

151
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,061
No.

152
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,484
You're only supposed to be buttoned up
for the convocation, moron.

153
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,111
Welcome to Gates, boys.

154
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,322
Hi, I'm Barney Cannel,
Todd Cannel's younger brother.

155
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,364
Right.

156
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,908
Todd told me to tell you
that he very much enjoys Yale.

157
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,201
Thank you.

158
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,704
- And you're Ellis Whitman?
- Yes, sir.

159
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,665
Dr. Eldridge.
We're happy to have you at Gates.

160
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,710
Your father Frank and I were roommates,
you know,

161
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,879
and I was lucky enough
to run with him senior year.

162
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,631
My father ran for student government?

163
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,758
He was class president,
but I meant cross-country.

164
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,522
We were on
the cross-country team together.

165
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:38,970
How is he?

166
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,514
He's fine, I guess.

167
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,391
You look like him, you know.

168
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,335
Tell him to give me a phone call, will you?

169
00:10:46,387 --> 00:10:47,595
- Yeah, sure.
- See you, boys.

170
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,318
Hey, I didn't know
Eldridge and your dad boned.

171
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,999
<i>It's been 23 days
and four hours since I last got high.</i>

172
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,717
<i>The one kid I thought was a stoner here</i>

173
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,419
<i>turned out to just be a slob.</i>

174
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,339
<i>There's no good Mexican food
in a 200-mile radius.</i>

175
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,508
<i>Goat Man's been incommunicado.</i>

176
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,177
<i>And when my classless,
Teletubby of a roommate</i>

177
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,595
<i>isn't whining about his grades,</i>

178
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,389
<i>he's copying my homework.</i>

179
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,100
Sorry.

180
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,645
I shouldn't even be here.

181
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,107
Our secret.

182
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,281
You know that one girl
who works in the dining hall?

183
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,078
The one who Rosenberg says
is a prostitute?

184
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,830
That trashy townie chick?

185
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,416
She's always sneaking in the library
and using our shit.

186
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,668
Todd told me she is a prostitute.

187
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,379
She'll do juniors and seniors
for, like, 50 bucks.

188
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,549
Your brother's full of shit.

189
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,594
At least he's not a drug addict
who hangs out with goats all day.

190
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,806
Pot's not addictive.

191
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,517
Todd writes me and sends me letters.

192
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,769
Mr. Goat hasn't sent you shit.

193
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,147
His name's Goat Man, asshole.

194
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,605
Whitman.
Come here.

195
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,716
I thought we weren't supposed
to talk to each other out here.

196
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,111
Only if you're going to go jerk off.

197
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,738
Rosenberg's from Maui.

198
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,824
He's one of three Jews on the island.

199
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,743
He can't seem to get better than a C
in any of his classes,

200
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,746
but he's smart enough
to get his weed through airport security.

201
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,915
Man, I knew you were a stoner.

202
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,336
- How?
- I saw your High Times calendar

203
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,089
and Barney said you smoke up
with your gardener.

204
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,716
He's not my gardener.
He's...

205
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,385
Mr. Rosenberg.

206
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,846
Mr. Cannel's roommate.

207
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,726
Enjoying a little cannabis, I see and smell.

208
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,603
Just me, sir.
Rosenberg didn't have any.

209
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,471
He was actually trying to convince me to...

210
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:18,631
I'll deal with you later.

211
00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:21,634
I need a moment alone
to talk to the tall one.

212
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,570
Keep it moving.

213
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:27,991
Well.

214
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,578
Looks like you'll be enjoying
cross-country after all.

215
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,042
We practice at 3:00 tomorrow.

216
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,300
Pick it up, fellas.
Pick it up!

217
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:49,345
I have bowels that run faster than you,
let's move!

218
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,142
Come on, Quadzilla, pick it up.

219
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,810
I can't.

220
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,062
You can't or you won't?

221
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,442
You weren't joking.
You really are out of shape?

222
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,110
I have blisters.

223
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,989
Did those blisters stop you
from hiking into the woods

224
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,241
to smoke weed with Rosenberg?

225
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,955
Move it, move it, move it!

226
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,292
Five more hills, let's go!

227
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,964
Hounds misses Sharky.

228
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,174
Let go.

229
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,468
Her teeth!

230
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,682
Here comes Mrs. Sharky!

231
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,267
Let go!

232
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,188
That one scares me a little bit.

233
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,151
Who are you?

234
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,695
I'm Bennet, Wendy's lover.

235
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,157
Boy, oh, boy.

236
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,826
Oh, yeah.

237
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,664
Must be nice, Javier, living here.

238
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:01,542
Rent-free, just cleaning the pool.

239
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,129
Taking care of the landscaping.
No worries.

240
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,090
It is nice.

241
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,843
That's your name, isn't it?
Javier?

242
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,428
Sure.

243
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,056
That's so funny,
you don't look like a Javier.

244
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:19,727
Right, Wendy told me
about your goat treks.

245
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,770
Where do you go?

246
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,607
- I wander.
- Where?

247
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,067
I can't be specific.

248
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,069
Why not?

249
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,738
It's my job.

250
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,326
What do you do?

251
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,914
I'm an artist.

252
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,499
Do you get high?

253
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,420
I've moved beyond that.

254
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,672
Sadness.

255
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,470
Hey!
Quit it, Lance!

256
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,766
It's about time.

257
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,686
What's up?

258
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,689
I got a package to mail.

259
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,442
Hey, is this enough stamps?

260
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,468
If this is what I think it is,
you might as well

261
00:17:09,511 --> 00:17:11,271
just go check yourself
into prison right now.

262
00:17:11,346 --> 00:17:13,372
Once I handed it to you, I was home free.

263
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,950
Not even close.
How's Ellis out there, anyway?

264
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,719
I haven't heard from him yet,
but I'm sure he's okay.

265
00:17:18,762 --> 00:17:20,054
What about all my stamps?

266
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,456
Peel them off.

267
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,791
Hey, you wanna get high?

268
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,793
I can't today.

269
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,673
Hey, leave it.

270
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:32,925
All right, come on, goats.

271
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:47,940
Shit!

272
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,488
I don't know why you're surprised.

273
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,157
All stoners are unreliable.
He's not going to send you anything.

274
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,241
Shut the hell up.

275
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,615
It just doesn't make any sense.

276
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:07,868
I haven't seen him in years,

277
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,095
and he thinks I'm just gonna
show up on his doorstep?

278
00:18:10,138 --> 00:18:11,872
Well, at least your
dad sends you letters.

279
00:18:11,915 --> 00:18:13,499
Mine's not allowed to.

280
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,011
Look, I'll be down there in DC
for Thanksgiving, too.

281
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,930
We can hang out and party in Georgetown.

282
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,183
What are you going to do?

283
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,812
Sit around here and wait for pot
in the mail that probably won't come?

284
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,024
Don't stay here.

285
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,901
It's not gonna be any fun.

286
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,236
You're gonna do nothing.

287
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,072
And you're just gonna get depressed,
all right?

288
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,990
Come to DC with me.

289
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,409
What about her?

290
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,370
Go ahead and ask her.

291
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,206
We both will.

292
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,961
Excuse me, ma'am?

293
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,047
Please don't call me ma'am.
I'm barely 31.

294
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,049
May we ask you a favor?

295
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,717
Let me guess, you go to Gates,

296
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,554
and you want me to buy you beer
or cigarettes or porno.

297
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,223
Just Budweiser.
A six pack of Budweiser.

298
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,604
Bottles or cans?

299
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,981
- Cans.
- Bottles.

300
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,482
Bottles.

301
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,903
Then she made me and Todd
watch a slide show on her laptop

302
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,157
of my dad kissing another man
on Poodle Beach in Rehoboth.

303
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,826
"There's your father, boys.

304
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,163
"There's your father and his boyfriend,
in love."

305
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,686
Then she came over and made Todd say,

306
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,083
"My dad's a faggot."

307
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,087
I wouldn't say it,
so she tried to move my jaw

308
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,132
and that's when she burnt me
with her cigarette.

309
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,760
By mistake.

310
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,931
- My mailman's gay.
- My dad's not gay.

311
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,893
That was just a phase.
He lives with some woman in Houston now.

312
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,352
I'm not allowed to see him.

313
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,108
I don't know if my dad's
in New York or DC.

314
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,154
- He's always with some new slut...
- I gotta pee.

315
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,460
Shit.

316
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,152
Fucker Frank.

317
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,156
Runners, come on, let's go.
Knees up!

318
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,170
Hello?

319
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,883
Who's this?

320
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,551
Let me talk to Wendy.

321
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,053
Tell me who this is.

322
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:14,647
Hello?

323
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,359
Is this 520-887-4311?

324
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,735
Who is this?

325
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,654
Put Goat Man on.

326
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,739
Tell me who this is.

327
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,550
My mom has a new asshole boyfriend.

328
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,726
She'll have a meltdown
if I go to Frank's.

329
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,064
So you'll stay here and eat
depressing meals with the teachers

330
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,941
and their grubby families?

331
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,901
Come to DC.

332
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,470
That one question where
you're supposed to find out

333
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:05,331
how many grandchildren
does Mrs. Smith have,

334
00:22:05,373 --> 00:22:06,507
I kept getting negative six.

335
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,118
Yeah, Mrs. Smith and her
grandchildren can suck my dick.

336
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,537
Some dick got a 96
and messed up the curve.

337
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,874
Ellis and I studied our asses off all night,
and I only got a 73.

338
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,876
What'd you get, Ellis?

339
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,878
- Ninety-six.
- Douche.

340
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,421
Hey, here's my girl.

341
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,882
I see her here every Tuesday
and Thursday at this time.

342
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,259
Yeah, after she's done servicing
the juniors and seniors.

343
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,182
- You're an asshole, Barney.
- Shut the hell up.

344
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,764
Hi, Ellis.

345
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,015
Hey.

346
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,518
Ellis, how does she know your name?

347
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:46,072
This is the doll.
She's brand new today, ladies.

348
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,429
We've done a version of Sasha before.

349
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,120
But this is a new configuration.

350
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:55,952
So it's the only day that...

351
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,208
Hello?
Who is this?

352
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,928
Tell Wendy that I'm spending
Thanksgiving with Fucker Frank

353
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,429
and his girlfriend in Washington.

354
00:23:02,472 --> 00:23:04,807
If she doesn't want me to,
she knows how to contact me.

355
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:08,302
And remind her that the Volvo
is supposed to be serviced this month.

356
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,721
So, this is Ellis?

357
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,807
Just tell her.

358
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,267
Oh, boy!

359
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,488
Ellis!
Your mom just called.

360
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:31,075
She wants you to go to Tucson
for Thanksgiving, and not to go to DC.

361
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,829
So she calls now?

362
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,914
She sounded really stoned!

363
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,043
Come on.
Let's go.

364
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,521
Oh, shit!

365
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,558
Could you come over here
and clean this, Javier?

366
00:24:04,601 --> 00:24:06,060
I'll switch chairs.

367
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,780
Excuse me?

368
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,992
You just got to pick up the shards

369
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,619
and spray the juice with the hose
before it gets sticky.

370
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:19,707
- You broke the glass, not me.
- Yes?

371
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,501
Get up off your ass and clean it.
I'm busy with this bush.

372
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,212
Well, it's your job, not mine.

373
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,881
Hey, buddy, fuck you.

374
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:34,889
What did you say to me?

375
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,350
You're free-balling, man.

376
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,102
What?

377
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,229
One of your nuts wants out.

378
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,278
There you go.

379
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:52,907
I think that you and me and Wendy
need to have a talk

380
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,450
about your place around here.

381
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,661
You mean the pool house?

382
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:03,542
- Who's awake!
- Me! Me! Yeah, I needed to sleep!

383
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,627
Yeah.

384
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,171
I've been so worried.
You know, Ellis never called.

385
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:11,759
The pool looks really nice, Javier.
It's so blue.

386
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,013
Aren't you the chick
that threw the rock at Ellis?

387
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,515
Yeah.
So what?

388
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,851
- Besides, Ellis was spying.
- Come on.

389
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,561
I need to feel like a mom again.

390
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,772
It's been so long since Ellis left.

391
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,649
I'm going to take Aubrey to the mall.

392
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,660
I'll pick you up some of those
boxer shorts you like.

393
00:25:29,744 --> 00:25:31,245
What about me?

394
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:33,989
We'll get you a new swimsuit.

395
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:35,783
That is so sick!

396
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,702
And Bennet, clean up that juice mess
before the ants come.

397
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,793
What do you mean,
you're leaving right now?

398
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:46,919
It's Thanksgiving!

399
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,255
Stop, right now.
You need to behave.

400
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,798
Why do you have to go?

401
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,280
You know what, because I need to go.

402
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,384
Please!
This isn't fair!

403
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:54,760
It's totally fair.

404
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:58,222
Because you're acting out.
This is totally fair, now I feel justified.

405
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,646
She's such a bitch.

406
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,326
Tastes like ass.

407
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,329
You would know.

408
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:28,961
If your friend's sleeping over,

409
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,964
I don't want him touching anything
in the guest room.

410
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:35,009
I leave in two hours.
Don't touch anything.

411
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,885
The credit card is in the kitchen.

412
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,610
You can have Thanksgiving
at the Beckers'.

413
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,847
Fine.

414
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,717
At least you can do whatever you want
the whole weekend.

415
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:48,689
If she weren't so selfish, she would be
going to Paris on Monday instead.

416
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,235
My mom wrote the book on selfish.

417
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,738
Fuck.

418
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,542
- I'll call you later, okay?
- All right.

419
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,432
It's good to see you.
You look tall.

420
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,810
I grew, I guess.

421
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,189
- You look different, too.
- Yeah?

422
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,231
Yeah.

423
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,269
Judy will be glad to know
that you think I look different.

424
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:40,190
She's been sort of
cultivating my new image.

425
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,326
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

426
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:47,331
I forgot to show you my store
back there on the right.

427
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:53,295
I actually sold all 48 stores
to a furniture conglomerate.

428
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,341
They're changing the name to Adobe,
which I think is dumb, but...

429
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,637
What do you do now?

430
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,849
I still... I keep pretty busy.

431
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,309
Yeah, I read a lot.

432
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,274
Yeah.

433
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:18,779
A senator from Georgia lived
in this house for 30 years in the 1800s.

434
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,240
That's actually a portrait of him there.

435
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,283
Dog lover, I guess.

436
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,955
Listen, about Judy and me,

437
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,290
the reason I wanted you to visit...

438
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:34,653
I thought I smelled it in the car.
Have you been drinking?

439
00:28:34,695 --> 00:28:36,113
Hey, guys.

440
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:40,843
Ellis, it's so nice to finally meet you.

441
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,722
You, too.

442
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,766
You been hitting the bottle today?

443
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,226
That's what I thought.

444
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:54,815
Why don't you bring your bag upstairs?
It's the first bedroom on the left,

445
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,817
and then you can meet us at the table.

446
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,486
You can eat off any lingering inebriation.

447
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,201
He'll be okay.

448
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,837
I don't share Judy's cavalier attitude
about your drinking.

449
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:20,257
I don't have a cavalier attitude.

450
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,281
Ellis, do you want some more stuffing?

451
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:25,846
Yes, ma'am.

452
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:28,056
Ellis, you can call me Judy.

453
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:37,232
You know, you're the one who's cavalier.
You're married again.

454
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,998
I'm gonna have a new brother or sister,
and you didn't even tell me.

455
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:41,904
Brother.

456
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,490
A new brother.

457
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,074
You're only 14 years old.

458
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,618
What were you drinking?

459
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,669
And where the hell
were this kid's parents anyway?

460
00:29:49,712 --> 00:29:50,946
I'm 15 years old.

461
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,540
We were drinking scotch,
and Barney's mother's in Paris.

462
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:55,876
He never sees his father.

463
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,778
Is that supposed to mean something?

464
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,591
He spilled the scotch on me, by the way.

465
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,555
That's why you could smell it.
I barely had any.

466
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,638
Okay.

467
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,264
Excuse me.

468
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:19,149
Hey, Frank knows you're 15.

469
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:23,111
I mean, that's how he refers to you,
as his 15-year-old son.

470
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:26,406
He sent you those hiking boots
for your birthday last June.

471
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,784
I was with him when he bought them.

472
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,544
When he got your midterm grades,

473
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:42,089
he called to tell me about them.
All As.

474
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,758
He said he never once
got all As at Gates.

475
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,803
He's proud of you, Ellis.

476
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,889
No.

477
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,141
Thanks.

478
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:56,186
You've never heard of Gates Academy?
It's very famous.

479
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,437
It's very traditional.

480
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:03,277
No cell phones, no Internet in the dorms,

481
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,528
they force you to take Latin.

482
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:08,115
Tell Ellis not to worry.
I mean, Latin's a dead language.

483
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:10,158
- It's useless.
- I'm taking Spanish.

484
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,120
Say something in Spanish, honey.

485
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,500
That one's smart.

486
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,452
She just said, "I want to eat cheese."

487
00:31:20,495 --> 00:31:21,703
Sorry I'm late.

488
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:25,090
Ellis is with Frank, and he hasn't called.

489
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,884
He'll call.

490
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,219
- You stoned?
- No.

491
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,388
I told you I'm not.

492
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:32,806
I'm not.

493
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:37,060
I love your tie.
It's so tribal.

494
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,812
Okay, everybody,

495
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,650
we are going veggie this year.

496
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,194
This is faux turkey.

497
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:51,325
- It smells wonderful.
- Tofu turkey. Who would've thought?

498
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:55,328
I wonder what kind of shit
they're feeding Ellis in Washington.

499
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,247
You promised.
No Frank talk.

500
00:31:57,498 --> 00:32:00,876
So, Javier, tell me about
the next goat trek you're planning.

501
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,170
It's still in the works.

502
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:06,340
The goats are in training.
They're afraid of the water.

503
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:10,052
I'll be taking them up
to higher elevation soon, to snow.

504
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,804
Black and tan male
with the horns, Lance...

505
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,848
- Yeah, that's him.
- Lance. Yeah.

506
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:19,019
He bothers me when I'm reading
my paper by the pool. Very bad gas.

507
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:22,272
If goats don't fart,
their intestines will explode.

508
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,858
- I highly doubt it.
- No, I've seen it. A major mess.

509
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,947
I saw a baby goat once, born inside out.

510
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,741
- Inside out.
- Gross!

511
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,328
You know, Jav, I think you may be
onto something with these goat treks.

512
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,413
Yeah, a return to the earth.

513
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,958
You know, I bet Johanna would love

514
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,335
to hear about these goat treks,
wouldn't she?

515
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,796
Wouldn't she?
She's our spirit coach.

516
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,298
She's always interested
in new forms of spirit healing.

517
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,717
I'm not sure these treks
have healed my spirit.

518
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,219
I bet they have.

519
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:56,056
You didn't even notice,
'cause you're not in touch with your spirit.

520
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,224
It's a good point, Javier.

521
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,415
What?

522
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,709
- Hello?
- Hey, Mom, it's me.

523
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:27,379
Ellis, I told you
I needed you here this weekend.

524
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,589
Why didn't you at least
call me yesterday?

525
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:32,259
Ellis!
Do you want me to wash your fleece?

526
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,594
Yeah, sure.
Thank you.

527
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,310
What does she look like?

528
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,938
It's not the same Judy.

529
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,356
It's not the same Judy?

530
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,316
This one's really nice and attractive.

531
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,110
Attractive?

532
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,446
Okay.
How young is she?

533
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,748
I don't know.
Maybe a little younger than you.

534
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,533
Figures.

535
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,620
- What about Frank?
- He's fine, I guess.

536
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,832
He has new glasses.
Poetry glasses.

537
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,543
Poetry glasses?

538
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,629
Hey, Ellis, Frank's home.
It's time to go.

539
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,006
Okay, thanks.

540
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,633
Hey, Mom.
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

541
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,302
Why?

542
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,221
Frank has some kind of tour planned.
He just got back.

543
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,894
You're making a big mistake.

544
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,147
Mom, I have to go.

545
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,070
- Bye. Okay?
- Fine.

546
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,413
I've been looking
for this record for years.

547
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,791
I can't even find it on the Internet.

548
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,417
Do you even have a turntable?

549
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:50,378
- Yeah, Goat Man got me one.
- Of course he did.

550
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,259
So, you like Judy?

551
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,096
Yeah, she's really nice.

552
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,432
Look, don't tell her I told you this,

553
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,250
but when you wrote for me
to come down here,

554
00:35:04,293 --> 00:35:06,268
at first I thought you were talking
about the Judy

555
00:35:06,353 --> 00:35:07,962
you brought to Tucson a few years ago.

556
00:35:07,988 --> 00:35:09,768
- The loud obnoxious one...
- That was Trudy.

557
00:35:09,798 --> 00:35:12,217
And she wasn't obnoxious.
She was nervous.

558
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,996
You know it was your mother
that kept me away from Tucson

559
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:18,206
for all that time.

560
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,767
Every time I'd show up,
she'd start some new drama,

561
00:35:20,809 --> 00:35:22,810
even if I didn't bring along a lady friend.

562
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,794
Does she still refer to me as
"Fucker Frank"?

563
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,937
- Hello.
- Can you put Wendy on the phone?

564
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,730
Who's calling?

565
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,817
You know who this is.
Just put her on the phone.

566
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:57,320
I can't. She went to a healing
vortex workshop in Sedona.

567
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,822
She won't be back till tomorrow.

568
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,408
Okay, when she gets back,
tell her I've gone on a trek,

569
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,742
backside of Mt. Lemmon.

570
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,911
Four days.
She likes to know where I go.

571
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:08,540
Why? As far as I can tell,
she wouldn't care if you disappeared.

572
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,792
She's done
with your chemically-induced lifestyle.

573
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:16,256
I didn't ask for your response to that...
Hello?

574
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,343
Dick!

575
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:25,223
He's a dick!

576
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,312
Hey, guys.

577
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,988
You fuckers ate my weed!

578
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,251
That's it, you win!

579
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,837
We're going home.

580
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,465
Idiots.

581
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,225
Yikes.

582
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,906
You ordered the health food?

583
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,035
Dig in.

584
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,328
Pizza.

585
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,455
I already feel like a cow.

586
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:56,041
You're not a cow.
Not even close.

587
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,417
He can come back anytime.

588
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:02,172
Hey, you know, you should really think
about joining us in Telluride this summer.

589
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:05,300
You can mountain bike and camp and swim.

590
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,260
And we'll have the baby by then.

591
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,557
Hello?

592
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,726
Hello.
May I please speak with Ellis Whitman?

593
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:15,810
Just a minute.

594
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,437
It's for you.

595
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,189
Is it my mother?

596
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:22,484
No, it's your roommate.
He's very polite.

597
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,695
- What?
- I got pot!

598
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,035
I meant what I said about Telluride.

599
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,746
I think it'd be great
for you to come out this summer.

600
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,207
I don't think so.

601
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,003
- Frank, come on.
- Are you kidding, honey?

602
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,796
He shows up drunk for Thanksgiving dinner.

603
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,048
You sneak out last night
to do God knows what.

604
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:10,717
How are you going to stay in school?

605
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,219
I'm getting all As
except for an A-in Latin.

606
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,471
Mea culpa.

607
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:21,102
How do you expect me to do this
when you don't give a shit?

608
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,063
You don't give a shit, either.

609
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:26,441
- Are you kidding me?
- Okay. Guys?

610
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:28,401
All right.

611
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:40,705
You know,

612
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,541
if you were getting an inheritance
from your dad,

613
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,376
now you have to split it.

614
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,215
Haven't you had enough of that shit?

615
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,094
Don't tell me what to do.

616
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,979
You're gonna have
to wash those in the sink.

617
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:14,647
I can smell the alcohol from over here.

618
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,644
You can't leave them there,
we'll get busted.

619
00:42:19,686 --> 00:42:22,188
- Go wash them in the sink.
- Fuck you, you're not my boss.

620
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:24,832
What's your problem?

621
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,417
Wash the fucking pants!

622
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,303
My award!
You asshole!

623
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,066
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Get up!

624
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,652
Get up.
Both of you calm down!

625
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:53,820
Are you okay?

626
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:01,369
Let's get to the bottom of this
so we can all get on with our lives.

627
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,288
Tell me what happened tonight.

628
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,957
Barney was being obnoxious,
so I tackled him.

629
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,166
And before that?

630
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,460
Barney was being obnoxious before that.

631
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:11,671
He means,
what did you do before the fight?

632
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,841
Like, were you and Barney
drinking any alcoholic beverages?

633
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:18,177
I'm quite capable of expressing myself,
Mr. Rosenberg.

634
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,512
And why are you here, anyway?

635
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,806
I'm not feeling good.
I think I have the flu.

636
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,491
You can wait in the hall until I'm done
speaking with Whitman here.

637
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:29,397
But I'm suffering from FACT.
Fever, aches, chills, and tiredness.

638
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,857
The hall.

639
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,322
I'll tell you what happened.

640
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:41,034
You and Barney, Mr. Cannel.

641
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,620
You and Mr. Cannel
were drinking on the bus.

642
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,539
You argued, you started to fight,

643
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:50,001
you threw his award against the wall,
and he kicked you in the testicles.

644
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,004
That sounds pretty close, sir.

645
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:58,843
I've looked at your midterm reports,
Mr. Whitman. You're doing well.

646
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:01,012
I study a lot.

647
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:05,975
So tell me about your visit with your father.
How's he doing?

648
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,856
Okay.

649
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,858
Now, business.

650
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,069
No more weekend privileges,

651
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:18,312
and you're going to have
sequestered detention dinners

652
00:44:18,397 --> 00:44:19,605
until next semester.

653
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:21,907
And, of course, you know
I'm going to have to call

654
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,032
your mother in Texas
to inform her of this incident.

655
00:44:24,035 --> 00:44:25,945
- I live in Arizona, sir.
- Of course. Phoenix.

656
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,664
- Tucson.
- You bet.

657
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,396
Hi, Wendy.

658
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,529
Get down here and roll.

659
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:03,616
Listen to your body, Javier.
You know, it's good stress therapy.

660
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:04,909
No, thanks.

661
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,955
I was wondering if...

662
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:10,957
You know where your checks are?

663
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,917
If I could maybe...
I was thinking I could...

664
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,502
I could write myself one,

665
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,504
for, you know, last month.

666
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:19,966
I ordered that Fortunella japonica,

667
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:22,176
the kumquat bush for outside
the den window.

668
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:29,600
The headmaster called
from Gates this morning.

669
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:32,979
Ellis did some drinking
on the way back to school

670
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,273
from his stay with Fucker Frank.

671
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,650
He and his roommate got into a fistfight.

672
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:42,739
And I have to write a check for $700
to patch a wall that Ellis broke.

673
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:46,200
I can't see Ellis in a fight like that.
Is he okay?

674
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:49,162
No, of course he's not all right.
What do you think?

675
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,873
After a weekend with Frank,
I'm sure he's a total wreck.

676
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,669
The headmaster also said that Ellis
has the highest grades in his class.

677
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,338
They're turning him into a Frank clone.

678
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,550
They're already talking to me
about colleges.

679
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:04,051
- He's only 15.
- I know.

680
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,262
He shouldn't have to worry about
things like that.

681
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:09,849
I can't take care of him from here, Javier.
I can't.

682
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,392
I can't do it.

683
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:12,810
I miss him.

684
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:17,356
I miss him so. I miss him
way more than I thought. Way more.

685
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:20,067
- How are the bills and stuff?
- That's not why I miss him.

686
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,529
I'm a mother
and my son is 3,000 miles away.

687
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,406
I am missing a piece of myself.

688
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,825
He'll be home soon.

689
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:33,039
Johanna said that mothers and sons,
even though we share the same blood,

690
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:36,083
can sometimes be as cosmically distant

691
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,419
as two strangers on different continents.

692
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:43,633
I don't see why a mother should be
concerned about relating cosmically.

693
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,134
You should just call him up,

694
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:50,348
and ask him about school, food, girls.

695
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,977
I should really just be mainstream?

696
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,188
Sure.

697
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,616
Sorry, nothing came for you.

698
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:11,410
Thanks.

699
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,120
You can check again tomorrow.

700
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:23,840
Hey.

701
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:31,264
Someone hasn't been at dinner in a while.

702
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:34,642
I got sequestered detention dinners
until next semester.

703
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,479
I never took you for a bad boy.

704
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:45,820
- You're always in here.
- I'm not illiterate.

705
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:53,536
I'm working my way through a list
of the 100 best novels of all time.

706
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,042
This is my third favorite book.

707
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:02,461
The Great Gatsby.

708
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,048
My second's To Kill a Mockingbird.

709
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,599
All right.
What's your favorite?

710
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:20,771
Wouldn't you like to know.

711
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:39,957
You know, you can play your music louder.
I don't mind.

712
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:42,752
Thanks.

713
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,525
I'm gonna fail algebra tomorrow,

714
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:09,195
and I'm gonna fail history on Wednesday,

715
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:11,322
and I'm gonna flunk out of Gates.

716
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:15,159
I guess you're not going to Yale.

717
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,412
I probably deserve it
for kicking you in the nuts.

718
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,373
That was a cheap kick.

719
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,292
I'm sorry.

720
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:25,711
I just...

721
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,880
I can't even do completing the square

722
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,257
and I only know
the first cycle of the Krebs cycle

723
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:33,052
and all the kings in history seem the same.
And I just...

724
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,304
I don't know what to do anymore.

725
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:38,849
I'm gonna flunk out of Gates.
I'm never gonna do anything.

726
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:01,163
Here's a good trick for history
that Goat Man taught me, all right.

727
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,749
See this portrait of Pope Leo X?

728
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:10,297
Look at him.
Remember his name and read what he did,

729
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:13,092
then imagine him doing it.
Okay?

730
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:39,243
You know, I owe you one.
You really saved my ass.

731
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,121
I know.

732
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:45,624
I'm going to study over break,
so I'm not such a loser next semester.

733
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:51,172
I'm gonna float on a raft in the pool
and smoke a bale of pot

734
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,967
and go running a lot.

735
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,678
- Won't the pot cancel out the running?
- Hey, bad boy!

736
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:00,931
Merry Christmas.

737
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,854
You know, Smythe and Van Buren
were in the car with Minnie.

738
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:11,417
She's probably giving them a ride
to the bus station or something.

739
00:51:11,459 --> 00:51:13,627
I bet she's giving them a ride.

740
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:16,405
The water's nice.

741
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:18,991
It's nice and warm.

742
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,035
I love the water.

743
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:23,496
Yes.
Yeah.

744
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:24,830
Okay, boy.

745
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:25,998
Right there.

746
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:27,458
Good boy.

747
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:29,919
There you go.

748
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:36,133
You have pretty nice arms for a stoner.

749
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,012
Hey!

750
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:42,807
What are you doing?

751
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:46,060
The goats hate water,
so I'm training them not to.

752
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,772
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but there's no water in there.

753
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:52,691
Well, you obviously
know nothing about training goats.

754
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:54,568
First they have to get used to the pool.

755
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,196
What are you doing later?

756
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:00,950
You sure are nosy.

757
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:03,953
I just want to know
what makes you tick, Javier.

758
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,372
For example, what are those?

759
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:14,004
Ever hear of art?

760
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:19,885
Bennet and Wendy are in Sedona

761
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:23,097
on that New Age bullshit
spirit workshop, right?

762
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,725
When do they get back?

763
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:54,211
That was quick.
I was just getting comfortable.

764
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,134
What do you do?

765
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,595
What do you do all day?

766
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:06,056
Do?

767
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,691
You know, I do the landscaping.

768
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,485
Work with the goats.

769
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:21,989
Clean the pool.

770
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:25,242
Don't you get bored?

771
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,455
Well, I do other stuff.

772
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,419
Like get high all day?

773
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:42,134
Is it true what they say
about you and your goats?

774
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:45,429
That you know them in the biblical sense?

775
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,224
It's not true.

776
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,517
I hate my goats.

777
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,167
What the hell?

778
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,295
- Sorry. Are you Ellis?
- Give me my bag!

779
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,421
Pervert.

780
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,132
I'm not a pervert, I'm Bennet.

781
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:35,980
Wendy?

782
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:38,274
Mom?

783
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,025
Ellis.

784
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,278
You scared the hell out of me, Ellis.

785
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:44,280
Sorry.

786
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:49,201
I've had these miserable headaches
since September.

787
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:54,081
Starts in my heart, goes around my head,

788
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:56,208
and back down to my heart.

789
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:04,091
Come here, come give your mom a hug
and tell me how was your trip.

790
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,723
- I slept on my flights.
- Yeah.

791
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,977
Did you miss me?

792
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:20,482
- Of course I missed you.
- I couldn't tell.

793
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,706
Yeah, that's it.
Toke the fat pappy, girlie.

794
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:38,083
Hey, Ellis!

795
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:39,918
Aubrey?

796
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:41,295
That's my bong.

797
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,925
I thought your plane
didn't get in till tonight.

798
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:04,651
Lance, leave it!

799
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,446
Lance, quit it!

800
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:16,163
I can't even get him to follow me.

801
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,667
Maybe he's disappointed in you.

802
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:25,798
- I know you think I'm a traitor, but...
- She's not even half your age.

803
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:29,802
She looks older, you have to admit.

804
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:36,975
You could have at least written me
or something.

805
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,143
Yeah.

806
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,565
I'm bad at that.

807
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:46,985
Sorry.

808
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,321
And Bennet.

809
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:52,741
You should have warned me about him.

810
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:53,867
Yeah.

811
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,703
He's a royal dick.

812
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:03,252
Hey, I'm going on this big trek
the day after Christmas.

813
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,587
Down into Mexico.

814
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,257
You want to come, partner?

815
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,718
I don't know.

816
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,638
Frieda, come on.

817
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:22,748
- Ellis!
- Hi, Jonathan.

818
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:24,541
How's the fancy prep school?

819
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:26,919
It's fancy.
I study a lot.

820
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:29,087
I got blackmailed
into running cross-country.

821
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,881
- What about the girls?
- What girls?

822
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:33,300
- It's all boys.
- Exactly!

823
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:38,305
Did the Goat Man have any luck
sending you any provisions?

824
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:41,600
He tried sending something
via US Mail, but I stopped it.

825
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:42,643
Really?

826
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:45,270
It isn't worth the risk these days.

827
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,956
We have to make this fast!

828
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:10,462
Because your Spanish is horrible.

829
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:15,867
It's past 6:00 already.
I should be home wrapping presents.

830
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:16,593
I appreciate it.

831
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,679
You haven't shown me
how much you appreciate it.

832
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:21,682
I appreciate it this much.

833
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:27,479
What have you been
getting up to lately anyway?

834
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:34,361
I've been breeding non-eco intrusive goats
for the biosphere.

835
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:36,738
Plus some rescue goats

836
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:41,118
that are trained to sniff survivors
out of the rubble in a disaster,

837
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,328
should there be a disaster.
Disaster goats.

838
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:46,364
- Sounds important.
- I'm going to make this easy for you.

839
00:59:46,407 --> 00:59:48,766
Just use the clippers.
Just, you know...

840
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:51,044
- You sure?
- Yeah, make me look like Steve McQueen.

841
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:55,716
I'm a scientist.

842
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:57,426
Not a hippie.

843
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,186
- No, olives are a party favor.
- When's the last time

844
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:01,612
you got olives as a party favor?

845
01:00:01,697 --> 01:00:03,489
That's 10 points
because it's a double word.

846
01:00:03,573 --> 01:00:04,516
Mexican casserole!

847
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:07,102
"H". A party favor that begins with "H".

848
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:09,855
- "Hookah."
- That's a foreign word.

849
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:11,106
It doesn't count.

850
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:13,066
Sorry I'm late.

851
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:18,478
I'm cleaning up my act.

852
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:21,033
You look amazing.

853
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,826
Let me touch.
Touchy-feely.

854
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,870
Hi, baby.

855
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,206
Okay, if everybody's done
fawning over Goat Man,

856
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:30,242
hookah is a foreign word,
so that's doesn't count.

857
01:00:30,284 --> 01:00:32,565
I'll look it up in the dictionary,
the English dictionary,

858
01:00:32,578 --> 01:00:34,898
- if you really want to challenge.
- Yeah, challenge. Yeah.

859
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:38,383
Bennet. Bennet, honey,
you're going to lose your turn.

860
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:42,471
- "Hookah, an Oriental tobacco pipe..."
- Oriental.

861
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:45,349
"...with a long flexible tube
that draws the smoke through the water

862
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:47,525
- "in a tin bowl."
- So that's still a foreign word.

863
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:49,186
No, but it's in the English dictionary.

864
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:52,522
- Like "charlatan" is.
- Yeah.

865
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:55,067
Or "gigolo."

866
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:57,903
Or "fellatio."

867
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:01,490
Honey, you lose your turn.

868
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:02,866
All right, okay.

869
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:04,451
Honey!

870
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:05,744
Hey, hey, honey.

871
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:06,870
"Hissy," noun.

872
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,081
- "A fit of anger. Temper tantrum."
- Hey, hey, hey.

873
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:11,249
Hey, you know what,
that's the kind of snarky bullshit

874
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:13,335
that Frank used to pull all the time.

875
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:17,381
My God, you are turning into him.
You're turning into him.

876
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:19,633
Wait, are you talking about Fucker Frank?

877
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:21,876
You know, you never finished
telling me that story...

878
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,000
- Aubrey! Aubrey!
- I know.

879
01:01:23,003 --> 01:01:25,371
Well, you want to know more
about Fucker Frank, ask Ellis.

880
01:01:25,398 --> 01:01:26,515
He's his new best friend.

881
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:29,518
And she should know the hell
that that man put me through.

882
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:33,897
And now he sends you an old sweatshirt
and everything is hunky-dory?

883
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:37,025
I bought you a $2,000 mountain bike,

884
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,653
and you don't have the
decency to try it out.

885
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,082
- I said thank you, like, 100 times.
- I didn't hear it.

886
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:43,531
- Feelings check.
- Did you hear it?

887
01:01:43,549 --> 01:01:46,201
Feelings check.

888
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:49,121
I feel that you might
be reacting negatively.

889
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:51,292
- Feelings check.
- Right, Wendy? Feelings check.

890
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:53,375
Feelings check.
Shut the hell up!

891
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:59,464
You know, marrying that man was
the worst decision I have ever made.

892
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:03,802
Why don't you tell Aubrey about the time
that you and Frank got in a fight

893
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,637
and how you disappeared for six days?

894
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,806
And he had to find you
living in a cheap motel?

895
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:10,142
- So?
- Or why don't you tell everyone

896
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:12,561
why Frank never visits Tucson anymore?

897
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:15,363
How you hid the keys to his rental car
and made him miss his flight.

898
01:02:15,448 --> 01:02:18,892
Okay, I don't need to be attacked
by my own son!

899
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,485
Fucking genetics!

900
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:23,447
You are the biggest, selfish prick
I have ever met!

901
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:25,157
Bigger than your fucking father!

902
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:29,161
Mister, you are coming with me
to Sedona tomorrow,

903
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:31,663
and you are going to do
that workshop with Johanna!

904
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:35,167
Yes, you are!
No more fucking goat treks!

905
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,668
Good job.

906
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:52,684
Listen, this is a special trek.

907
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,853
We're on a mission of philanthropy.

908
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:58,190
- What do you mean?
- We're helping a refugee

909
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,776
from Honduras into the United States.

910
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,445
That's illegal, isn't it?

911
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:06,448
She's a political refugee.

912
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:10,076
- You're joking, right?
- No.

913
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,579
My cousin Jesus set it up.

914
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:18,710
Is Jesus real Mexican or fake Mexican,
like you?

915
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,880
Fake Mexican?
What does that mean, fake Mexican?

916
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:25,383
Yeah, you know how you make
everyone call you Javier

917
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:28,053
even though your real name's Stephen
and you're Irish-Italian.

918
01:03:30,097 --> 01:03:33,225
I don't make everyone call me Javier.

919
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:34,768
They just do.

920
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,314
How are we gonna get the goats
across the border?

921
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:42,067
No one's gonna stop us.

922
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:43,777
Getting them to Mexico is no problem,

923
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:45,862
we'll be crossing the desert
on the way back.

924
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:08,260
After we meet Jesus at the Super Puerco,

925
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:09,928
we can party all night.

926
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:13,098
Don't use "party" as a verb.
It sounds vulgar.

927
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:17,519
Vulgar in the common, pedestrian sense,
not in the obscene sense.

928
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:19,604
I knew what you meant by "vulgar."

929
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:22,607
The bar's either to the
left or to the right.

930
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:24,818
That's helpful.

931
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:35,453
Try to look presentable.

932
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:36,705
Like me.

933
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,140
Jesus!

934
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,268
What the fuck do you want?

935
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:01,855
It's me, Javier.
I cleaned up for the trek.

936
01:05:01,939 --> 01:05:03,356
You look like a cop, man.

937
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:05,817
Who's the kid?

938
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,320
This is Ellis.
He's good with the goats.

939
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:12,991
Go outside and wait with the goats.

940
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:20,874
All right.

941
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,171
Can we do this in English?

942
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:34,179
Those are the ugliest dogs I've ever seen.

943
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:35,889
Thanks.

944
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:38,016
Get out of here, please.

945
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:42,437
Sorry about Jesus.

946
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:45,231
Isn't Jesus married with some kids?

947
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,275
Those prostitutes were, like, my age.

948
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,694
Where's the refugee?

949
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:51,446
The refugee?

950
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:54,032
She had to go back to Tegucigalpa.

951
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,034
Family issues.

952
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,862
So this whole thing was a waste of time?

953
01:05:58,904 --> 01:06:01,322
No, this was a good practice run.

954
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:14,552
You're setting it up in a wash?
That's dumb.

955
01:06:14,845 --> 01:06:16,346
They're rain clouds.

956
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:18,239
If you're so concerned
about being spotted,

957
01:06:18,324 --> 01:06:20,325
why the hell do you have
a bright orange tent?

958
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:24,312
- I'm starving.
- Frieda's right there. She's full of milk.

959
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:27,732
I'm looking for my power bars
and I find your sandwich, cheater.

960
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,694
What about Javier's golden rule
of goat trekking?

961
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:32,779
- Goat milk only.
- Hey! Put that back!

962
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:35,490
Jesus.

963
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:41,663
This wasn't my idea.

964
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,749
Not everyone is as
fortunate as you, Ellis.

965
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:48,086
Wendy and Bennet might kick me out,
and I don't have any money!

966
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:55,135
There never was a refugee, was there?

967
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:58,805
I swear, you don't know what it's like
having to ask Wendy for money.

968
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:00,849
Then get a job like a normal person!

969
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,351
I'm not a normal person.

970
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:06,563
Come on, let's go.
Pack up the tent.

971
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:08,106
We'll camp somewhere else.

972
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:10,483
Let's go.

973
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:12,444
Would you just give me a second?

974
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:14,208
- Come on. Get up.
- Get your hands off me.

975
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:21,036
Damn it!
Lance!

976
01:07:22,788 --> 01:07:23,288
Lance!

977
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:30,962
Goat Man.

978
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:47,979
Goat Man!

979
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:52,817
Goat Man.

980
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:50,291
Goat Man's going to be okay.

981
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,970
- Ellis, sweetie!
- That goat's not riding in my Jeep.

982
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:03,638
Are you okay?

983
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:05,765
Did Goat Man call?

984
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:13,439
The healing workshops were great.
Thanks for asking.

985
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:16,857
Aren't you even the slightest bit
worried about him?

986
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:21,072
The Hopi shaman at the workshop
said that I worry too much.

987
01:09:22,074 --> 01:09:23,408
Yeah, about yourself!

988
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:27,829
Okay, I can't leak my energy right now
worrying about Goat Man.

989
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:31,749
I have been advised to let it pool inward.

990
01:09:32,918 --> 01:09:35,086
Frank and Judy are married
and they're having a baby.

991
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:42,802
He's lying, hon.
He's trying to hurt you.

992
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:51,644
Let's go.

993
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:19,130
Okay, I know you're at Gates.

994
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:20,715
I know you're smart.

995
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:23,635
You make pretty good decisions.

996
01:10:25,137 --> 01:10:27,180
But I do worry about you.

997
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:29,682
All the time.

998
01:10:31,977 --> 01:10:33,311
I'm your mother.

999
01:10:35,522 --> 01:10:38,399
And just so you know,

1000
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:41,986
I was on the phone with
Johanna and the shaman,

1001
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:46,032
and without me telling anything
about what happened,

1002
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:50,828
the shaman mentioned
that Goat Man knows the desert

1003
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:55,250
and knows how to survive.

1004
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:58,378
Okay?

1005
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:01,047
And notice,

1006
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,342
I haven't said anything about Frank

1007
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:06,678
or his child bride.

1008
01:11:44,591 --> 01:11:47,051
- May I please speak to my mother?
- Who is this?

1009
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:49,220
How many children does Wendy have?

1010
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:51,556
- Did he call?
- Who?

1011
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,057
Don't be a prick!

1012
01:11:53,225 --> 01:11:57,228
You never even bother to ask
about me or your mother. That is rude.

1013
01:11:57,938 --> 01:11:59,439
Did Goat Man call or not?

1014
01:11:59,606 --> 01:12:01,816
Well, I have a slight cold,
and your mother...

1015
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:09,574
Maybe you should have Señor Levy
call the police in Mexico and ask

1016
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:11,943
- if they've heard anything...
- I'm sure Goat Man's fine.

1017
01:12:11,985 --> 01:12:13,236
Stop whining about him already.

1018
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:14,912
Line up, girls!

1019
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,667
Eat my shit.

1020
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,098
Quick one.

1021
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:37,852
Not bad, Whitman.

1022
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,864
Did you have PE today?

1023
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:51,991
Did you get sweaty?

1024
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,365
We should get drunk and go see that,
that'd be awesome.

1025
01:12:57,414 --> 01:12:58,998
Yeah, sounds like a plan.

1026
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:06,297
Nice bike.
Is that carbon fiber?

1027
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:07,799
Yeah, I think so.

1028
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:09,967
Give it to me.

1029
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:11,135
What?

1030
01:13:19,311 --> 01:13:20,436
Ellis!

1031
01:13:21,146 --> 01:13:22,146
Ellis.

1032
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:23,981
Oh, no.

1033
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,819
Come on, sit up.

1034
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:28,945
Sit up.

1035
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:01,352
I read To Kill a Mockingbird.

1036
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:06,691
And at first I thought
Atticus was sort of self-righteous.

1037
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:09,861
But by the end...

1038
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:13,489
You think there are people
like Atticus Finch in real life?

1039
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:19,412
I hope so.

1040
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:43,728
Enjoy the Percocets.

1041
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:47,482
Bye.

1042
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:50,401
Once you have made a cut
around the eyeball,

1043
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:52,278
separate the eye into two halves.

1044
01:14:52,529 --> 01:14:54,722
Let the vitreous humor
and any associated structure...

1045
01:14:54,806 --> 01:14:56,199
Barney, we're already on step six.

1046
01:14:56,241 --> 01:14:58,201
Can I finish?
This is step seven.

1047
01:14:58,243 --> 01:15:00,328
- Can I finish reading?
- I'm already done.

1048
01:15:00,412 --> 01:15:02,288
You may need to tease the vitreous humor

1049
01:15:02,372 --> 01:15:04,332
gently away from the lining of the eye.

1050
01:15:04,416 --> 01:15:06,667
I think I'm just gonna cut the retina.
Yeah.

1051
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:08,586
That's definitely not the retina.

1052
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:10,863
It doesn't look like
you're doing anything right.

1053
01:15:10,947 --> 01:15:13,107
- I got it.
- Wait, no, no, that's the cornea.

1054
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,842
No, that's the cornea, you moron.

1055
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:17,678
Careful, you don't want
to blind that cow forever.

1056
01:15:18,555 --> 01:15:19,597
What are you doing here?

1057
01:15:21,558 --> 01:15:23,809
I felt like taking a drive, I guess.

1058
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:24,977
What happened to your head?

1059
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:28,981
He got bike-jacked.
Four stitches.

1060
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:31,442
By a townie.
They hate all Gates students.

1061
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:32,818
What do you mean?

1062
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:34,903
It's fine. It's healing quickly.
Where's the photo?

1063
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:40,618
I'd like to introduce you
to your new brother,

1064
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:42,620
Gabriel.

1065
01:15:44,831 --> 01:15:46,123
He looks like Judy.

1066
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:49,085
Actually, he's a dead ringer for you
when you were a baby.

1067
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:57,218
You know, it's a known fact that all babies
look like old Jewish men.

1068
01:16:01,014 --> 01:16:03,933
Oh, boy, go easy on me.

1069
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,269
Senior year.

1070
01:16:07,604 --> 01:16:09,605
It's not as dorky as I thought.

1071
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:13,901
Wait, Latin club?
Young Historians?

1072
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:16,143
I was only in those for my dad,

1073
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:19,615
who was convinced I was too stupid
to get into college on grades alone.

1074
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:21,492
- Really?
- Yeah.

1075
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:23,578
- Eldridge said you were a brain.
- No.

1076
01:16:24,329 --> 01:16:26,706
When I was admitted to Princeton,
my father said,

1077
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:30,626
"Everyone wins the lottery once.
Don't blow this, Frank."

1078
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:37,258
Ellis, do you like it here?

1079
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:42,513
I mean, you know you can go back
to Tucson, or you could even come to DC.

1080
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:44,807
There are a lot of good day schools there.

1081
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:48,269
- Really?
- Yeah.

1082
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:51,272
I like it here, though.

1083
01:16:51,898 --> 01:16:53,224
We have our first meet next week.

1084
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:57,461
Coach put me on the varsity team.
I'm actually pretty fast.

1085
01:16:57,696 --> 01:16:58,904
Really?

1086
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:03,659
Yeah, that was my room
junior and senior years.

1087
01:17:04,244 --> 01:17:05,870
- You lived in Stillwell?
- Yeah.

1088
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:07,371
It's all nerds now.

1089
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:10,416
It was all nerds then, too.
You saw my yearbook photos.

1090
01:17:12,002 --> 01:17:13,419
You think Goat Man's all right?

1091
01:17:14,838 --> 01:17:18,257
Disappearing for a few months
is a very Goat Man thing to do.

1092
01:17:20,218 --> 01:17:22,219
- What about Wendy?
- Why?

1093
01:17:24,431 --> 01:17:26,015
I don't know.
She seems weird.

1094
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:28,392
She never returns my calls.

1095
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:32,229
She's really into New Age spirituality
and freaks out a lot.

1096
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:35,399
Well, when I first met her,
she was really into The Grateful Dead

1097
01:17:35,442 --> 01:17:37,193
and she freaked out a lot.

1098
01:17:38,945 --> 01:17:40,938
Ellis, I've always had a hard time
with your mom,

1099
01:17:41,022 --> 01:17:42,606
but that's not an excuse.

1100
01:17:43,617 --> 01:17:46,035
I'm sorry I've been absent from your life.

1101
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:50,706
Thanks.

1102
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,862
I'm sure you've had your fill
of the Gates food,

1103
01:17:56,946 --> 01:18:00,115
so we'll go out for dinner tonight.
Barney, too, if he wants.

1104
01:18:02,552 --> 01:18:04,113
Are you sure you want to invite Barney?

1105
01:18:04,304 --> 01:18:06,931
So Yale's application process
is really tough,

1106
01:18:06,973 --> 01:18:09,758
but I've been studying hard,
and Ellis has been helping me out a lot,

1107
01:18:09,801 --> 01:18:11,911
so I think I've got a really good shot
of getting in.

1108
01:18:11,995 --> 01:18:14,647
But if I don't get into Yale,
I'm gonna try for Tufts.

1109
01:18:14,731 --> 01:18:17,942
It's a little early to be
worrying about college, isn't it?

1110
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:21,153
This isn't the right way to the restaurant.

1111
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:24,782
Yeah, we got a little business
to take care of before dinner.

1112
01:18:27,285 --> 01:18:30,029
I'll talk reasonably to his parents
and if I don't make any progress,

1113
01:18:30,113 --> 01:18:31,447
I'll call the police.

1114
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:34,083
- Hello.
- Yes?

1115
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:36,252
I've come to retrieve my son's bicycle.

1116
01:18:36,294 --> 01:18:37,795
I believe you assaulted him and...

1117
01:18:41,341 --> 01:18:45,344
Mr. Whitman,
are you still taking us to dinner?

1118
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:57,314
Thanks for coming.

1119
01:18:58,692 --> 01:19:00,317
Thanks for getting my bike back.

1120
01:19:00,944 --> 01:19:02,778
Think about Telluride this summer.

1121
01:19:03,363 --> 01:19:04,989
Judy would love it if you were there.

1122
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:06,323
I mean, I would, too.

1123
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:11,495
Actually, so would your brother
if he could distinguish shapes.

1124
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:13,873
I will.

1125
01:19:14,499 --> 01:19:15,916
I almost forgot.

1126
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:19,170
It's a prospectus for my new company.

1127
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:21,881
Solar panel technology for vehicles.

1128
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:25,426
I assembled a team of geniuses,
aside from myself.

1129
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:28,762
I didn't want you to think
I wasn't doing anything.

1130
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:31,348
I'll look through it.

1131
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:39,440
Good luck with the race next week.

1132
01:19:41,526 --> 01:19:42,777
I'm really proud of you, Ellis.

1133
01:19:43,487 --> 01:19:44,528
Thanks.

1134
01:19:45,363 --> 01:19:46,989
See you soon.

1135
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:58,209
You got a package.

1136
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:00,377
You're studying history already?

1137
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:01,962
Who's it from?

1138
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:13,057
Goat Man!

1139
01:20:14,726 --> 01:20:16,143
It's from Goat Man!

1140
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:22,566
Close the door.

1141
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:28,906
Well, of course!
Look at what's happening!

1142
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:30,866
Bullshit.
You're a liar.

1143
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:33,402
- You're a liar. You're a big, fat liar.
- It's the only thing.

1144
01:20:33,445 --> 01:20:36,789
I can't help but think that if you could
just corral your energy, just redirect it,

1145
01:20:36,873 --> 01:20:39,808
- then you wouldn't be doing this.
- No matter how I redirect my energy,

1146
01:20:39,851 --> 01:20:40,935
you will always be a pig.

1147
01:20:41,019 --> 01:20:42,336
The jig is up.
Leave.

1148
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:45,313
- It's disgusting to think...
- But I still have to go through with it.

1149
01:20:45,356 --> 01:20:48,166
- ...that you would put...
- 'Cause I've got to put food in my mouth!

1150
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:52,346
...your slimy penis into me after that.
That's disgusting!

1151
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:53,810
- Get out of my face!
- All this...

1152
01:20:53,823 --> 01:20:55,999
- Get out of my face, you slut.
- ...seems so drastic.

1153
01:20:56,083 --> 01:20:57,768
You're a big fat slut.
Get out of my face.

1154
01:20:57,810 --> 01:20:59,044
If that's what you want, I...

1155
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:00,396
I'm done bankrolling you.

1156
01:21:00,438 --> 01:21:01,981
- Leave.
- Yeah, yeah.

1157
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:13,492
Runners, take your mark.

1158
01:22:21,561 --> 01:22:22,561
Hey.

1159
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:25,147
Hi, there.

1160
01:22:25,523 --> 01:22:26,857
What are you doing here so early?

1161
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:29,944
Picking up my pathetic check.

1162
01:22:35,283 --> 01:22:37,159
I got my bike back.

1163
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:38,410
That's good.

1164
01:22:38,745 --> 01:22:39,912
Good.

1165
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,334
I was thinking,

1166
01:22:47,545 --> 01:22:52,591
if you wanted to meet me off campus,
you could.

1167
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:01,934
I don't think so.

1168
01:23:02,185 --> 01:23:03,394
Come on, Ellis.

1169
01:23:03,436 --> 01:23:05,316
Why don't you spend
some of that allowance money

1170
01:23:05,355 --> 01:23:09,566
your parents send you
for being the perfect boy?

1171
01:23:15,865 --> 01:23:18,075
- If you change your mind...
- I won't.

1172
01:23:31,756 --> 01:23:33,507
Grapes of Wrath.

1173
01:23:35,802 --> 01:23:37,803
It's my favorite novel.

1174
01:24:33,526 --> 01:24:35,110
We gotta get you home.

1175
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:37,696
I think Wendy wants to take you out
to dinner for your birthday

1176
01:24:37,781 --> 01:24:41,658
and maybe show you your birthday present,
if you're up for it.

1177
01:24:41,993 --> 01:24:44,036
I almost forgot it was my birthday.

1178
01:24:57,550 --> 01:24:59,009
You know, when I was little,

1179
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:01,470
I used to love to hear Wendy
do a primal screaming.

1180
01:25:01,888 --> 01:25:03,514
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1181
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:06,058
It meant she'd actually be happy
for the few days afterwards

1182
01:25:06,142 --> 01:25:07,351
and play with me.

1183
01:25:08,478 --> 01:25:10,145
Thank God Bennet's gone.

1184
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:13,357
- Yeah, she actually kicked him out.
- No?

1185
01:25:13,441 --> 01:25:14,525
It was awesome.

1186
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:16,568
You know what else?

1187
01:25:17,153 --> 01:25:19,530
She milked Frieda
the whole time I was gone.

1188
01:25:19,572 --> 01:25:21,031
Kept her lactating.

1189
01:25:24,494 --> 01:25:25,661
Yeah, exactly.

1190
01:25:33,211 --> 01:25:34,628
Forty acres.

1191
01:25:35,547 --> 01:25:38,298
There'll never be a 7-Eleven
or a Wal-Mart out here.

1192
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:42,219
I forget how cool Wendy can be, you know.

1193
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:44,388
I helped pick it out.

1194
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:51,603
That house all the way over there is
owned by a surgeon from Canada.

1195
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:55,482
The rest is National Forest land.

1196
01:25:56,776 --> 01:25:58,777
It even smells good out here.

1197
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:01,155
This is the coolest birthday present.

1198
01:26:01,906 --> 01:26:02,906
Hey.

1199
01:26:03,032 --> 01:26:04,658
Welcome home spliff?

1200
01:26:05,743 --> 01:26:06,785
No, thanks.

1201
01:26:07,662 --> 01:26:09,955
I got plenty.
Enough for the whole summer.

1202
01:26:10,498 --> 01:26:12,291
The greenhouse is going strong.

1203
01:26:14,127 --> 01:26:18,088
I was thinking of maybe going
to Telluride with Frank and Judy

1204
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:19,840
and Gabriel for the summer.

1205
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:23,760
Gabriel?

1206
01:26:24,262 --> 01:26:26,221
That's the baby's name, Gabriel?

1207
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:27,431
Yeah.

1208
01:26:29,142 --> 01:26:31,143
I think you should go.

1209
01:26:31,811 --> 01:26:33,812
