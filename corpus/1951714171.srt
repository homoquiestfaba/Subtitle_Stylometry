1
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:36,834
How is that sentence? Today is
the first day of the rest of my life.

2
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:39,064
Good-bye, Cleveland.

3
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:43,007
All told me that I didn't leave,
that it didn't pursue my dream... 

4
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,634
 ... but I should leave of here.

5
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:48,545
Because I think of my mother
and in that I can end up as her... 

6
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:51,379
He/she would prefer to be dead.

7
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:55,979
I have dreamt of this
all my life.

8
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,651
I will toss to all of less,
but I should go... 

9
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,695
 ... because if not, I will always wonder
what it had happened.

10
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:07,665
And although it fails,
at least I will have attempted it.

11
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,897
But I won't fail.

12
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,370
This will be worth something some day.

13
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:16,239
A million dollars.

14
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:18,243
Yes.

15
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,774
<i > Awake!</i>

16
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:29,240
<i > he/she Hears. He/she hears.
Are you awake?</i>

17
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:54,168
Do you have a cigarette for me?

18
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,674
I sit down it. I no longer smoke.

19
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,117
Do you have fire?

20
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,211
Well... 

21
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:42,083
This strategy
you do usually work?

22
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,750
Do you want me to leave?

23
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:48,487
Do you want to leave?

24
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:54,557
No, but I understand how it shines.

25
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,228
Not there is nobody here,
a fellow leaves of he swims her.

26
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:01,205
I suppose that your parents
they noticed you of the strangers.

27
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,939
Are you a stranger?

28
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,110
I don't believe it.

29
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,914
Are you me afraid?

30
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,514
Should he/she fear you?

31
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:17,079
No.

32
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,589
But you should fear him/her
to what I am thinking.

33
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:28,859
I believe that we will be
one in the life of the other one.

34
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,970
Seriously?

35
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,531
Not I joke.

36
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,967
How do you know that I don't have boyfriend?

37
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,409
<i > Because you don't have it.</i>

38
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:44,544
And although you had it... 

39
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,450
 ... he could never love you
as me I will make it.

40
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,950
Go!

41
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,618
You are getting scared.
Should maybe leave.

42
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:56,692
It is well, I sit down it.

43
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,732
You not even know me.
Not you know my name.

44
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,665
How do you call yourself?

45
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,566
Hope.

46
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,404
Will.

47
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,908
Clever, we already know each other.

48
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,639
Not I wanted to get scared.

49
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,249
It is that I had that premonition
when I saw you.

50
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,380
<i > as if... </i>

51
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,685
 ... there was a connection.

52
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:32,124
I suppose that he/she could attempt
to invite you to go out with me... 

53
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,496
 ... to take coffee or something.

54
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,331
<i > AND to wait to the best moment
to tell you that, but... </i>

55
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,963
I believe that he/she is direct better being.

56
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,768
I already said it.

57
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,810
And if I ate up a shark
later or something?

58
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:48,079
Then never he/she had told it to you.

59
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,875
That would be very sad.

60
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:58,049
And if I don't sit down
the same connection that you?

61
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:03,926
I sit down it.
I seem surely a lunatic.

62
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:05,054
Yes, it is certain.

63
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,003
If it continues in foot that of the coffee... 

64
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,667
 ... I will accept the invitation
before he/she eats you the shark.

65
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:02,784
I sit down it.

66
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,516
He/she opens the eyes, girl.

67
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,790
<i > it is made This way, friend. Health.</i>

68
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:15,357
- He/she calms down, he/she calms down.
- Already coarse!

69
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,638
What do they make?

70
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,005
It was already hour.

71
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,977
- What are they putting to the coffee?
- Vodka.

72
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:29,344
Vodka with coffee.

73
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:30,415
Together.

74
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:33,611
It is very Russian.

75
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:36,746
<i > they are some losers.
For that reason always they are alone.</i>

76
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,087
But the night it doesn't still end up.

77
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:40,352
<i > seriously?</i>

78
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,155
Yes. My friend has a contact.

79
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:45,459
We will get product.
At what time do you finish?

80
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,089
<i > AT 6:00 o'clock.</i>

81
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,360
You already know where we will be.

82
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:49,434
<i > it is certain.</i>

83
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:52,994
You continue consuming
or are you in one of your Sabbath ones?

84
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:54,767
He/she hears.

85
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,637
We know that you don't have
anything why to get up.

86
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:01,043
Don't remind it to me.

87
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:04,810
<i > you Believe that some of your friends... </i>

88
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,579
<i >... want to go out with me... </i>

89
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:10,110
 ... or... 

90
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,817
<i >... want to come with you
or to leave?</i>

91
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:18,757
No, I speak seriously.

92
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,860
Very well. Very well.

93
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,700
He/she spoke the subject with the Russian accent.

94
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,363
<i > Excellent.</i>

95
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,102
You are really excellent.

96
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,546
He/she was afraid.

97
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,118
Of what?

98
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,221
Of what he/she will say you if... 

99
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,155
It was bad.

100
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,491
But that was astonishing.

101
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,537
It is a good song.

102
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,539
I like what you/they made him/her.

103
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:44,804
As I said, it is not only the song.

104
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,339
Do you want browner?

105
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,511
It was excellent.

106
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,317
Do you want to order something?

107
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:06,991
<i > Hope.</i>

108
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,661
You are special.

109
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,205
For how they sound, how they shine,
what you/they transmit.

110
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,605
<i > Jessica, your voice is exceptional.</i>

00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,200
<i > AND the songs. The... </i>

112
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:21,007
The third song,
that of the tree.

113
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,342
<i > hanging Tree.</i>

114
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:25,316
<i > hanging Tree?
He/she smells me of success.</i>

115
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,386
It was incredible the reaction
of the public in the club.

116
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,287
Thank You, Malcolm.
Do you speak seriously?

117
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:36,226

We are busy.

121
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,565
Can you return in some minutes?

122
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,127

00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,640
What you want, Jessica.
Boys, I invite.

126
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,738
I cannot eat now.

127
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:59,148
You can bring me a great one
jar of coffee with a sherbet?

128
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:01,346
Yes.

129
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,220
I will send their demonstration tape... 

130
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:09,125
<i >... to the hunt talents
of all the record ones.</i>

131
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,787
- Grandiose!

00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,124
Have they spoken more with somebody?

133
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,600
<i > Yes, there are... </i>

134
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,638
There is a couple of interested producers.

135
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:21,935
We have two meetings
the incoming week.

136
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:25,374
Not do still make anything, is it well?

137
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,446
Do they want him to return later?

138
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,243
No!

139
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:33,217
- Only promise me that not... 
- Is the chicken salad good?

140
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:36,584
Yes.

141
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:39,180
Promise me that they won't sign
with anybody... 

142
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,022
<i >... until we speak.
Because I know how they are these things.</i>

143
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,085
Believe me.
If they go with mistaken people... 

144
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:47,360
 ... and they make a bad decision,
they will ruin everything.

145
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,800
<i > they will End up in an insignificant employment
winning the minimum salary.</i>

146
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:57,064
I believe that I will order
the chicken salad.

147
00:12:57,143 --> 00:13:01,546
Let us say that the hunt talents
it is interested. What does it continue then?

148
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,980
Then they sign with the record one... 

149
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,983
 ... and they win millions of dollars... 

150
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,918
 ... and they don't put an end to an employment
as mine. Certain?

151
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,615
Yes, something like that.

152
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,115
Do you want to order?

153
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,250

Yes, I am well.

155
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:22,158
Well, I want a common salad.

00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,470
Do you have "soya-gur?"

161
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:37,004
"Soya-gur?" I don't believe it.

162
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:40,643
- Can you look for?
- At once.

163
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,146
"Soya-gur?"

164
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,986
As yogurt, but soya.

165
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,787
I never heard it name.

166
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,488
<i > I am allergic to the soya.
It is a cancerigenic one.</i>

167
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,793
Do we have "soya-gur?"

168
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,893
- That depends.
- Of what?

169
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,469
- Do you want him to have "soya-gur?"
- Do we have or not?

170
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,337
No, we have yogurt.

171
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,036
I hate my life.

172
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,812
This doesn't mean that you will become
famous and that you will leave me, certain?

173
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,216
I will become famous for you.

174
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,311
Very well.

175
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,181
I will be your inspiration.

176
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,819
<i > you become This way famous
and you make a lot of money... </i>

177
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:27,559
 ... and we can live with luxury
in the modern world.

178
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,238
You can be my inspiration.

179
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,009
And if I don't become famous?

180
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:45,380
You will achieve it.

181
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,477
I sent 40 tapes
to different record 4 months ago... 

182
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,749
 ... and I didn't receive neither an only call.

183
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,321
It is incredible.

184
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,497
That people are crazy.

185
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,662
Seriously you do believe that I am good?

186
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,775
Gordon, yes, yes.
Not it is grandiose?

187
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,613
<i > it is certain, they are fantastic!</i>

188
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,676
<i > they are seated with me now.</i>

189
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,187
<i > Yes.</i>

190
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:34,055
<i > What you say if we go to your house... </i>

191
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:37,118
<i >... when we finish here? Yes?</i>

192
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,892
<i > Grandiose. Brilliant. Good-bye.</i>

193
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:45,061
The most powerful man
of the business.

194
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,934
<i > it can return them you shatter.</i>

195
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,633
My God!

196
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,800
Yes... 

197
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,538
Do you have "soya-gur?"

198
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,102
Yes, we have.

199
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,375
I will eat the fruit and the "soya-gur."
Can you mix them?

200
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:58,746
Sure.

201
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,012
Thank you. Want to see them tonight!

202
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:04,180
<i > it is made This way!
We are on the way to half!</i>

203
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,315
<i > TO half on the way.</i>

204
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:09,826
A chicken salad,
a salad without seasoning.

205
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,659
And a salad of fruits
with the yogurt by way of "soya-gur."

206
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,392
This fellow yes that affected you.

207
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:15,899
How subject?

208
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:19,131
You know of who I speak.

209
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,002
<i > Well, let us begin another time.
It is the first taking.</i>

210
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,666
<i > it should be very dramatic.</i>

211
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,803
- I gave "hello."
- Hello.

212
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,105
You should pay attention to me... 

213
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,510
 ... because I have everything here.

214
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:11,384
I can pose a little
as they make it in MTV?

215
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:12,515
<i > Very well.</i>

216
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,252
I shine too well
to play.

217
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:16,419
I will stop here
and I will shine like a star.

218
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,292
<i > it is good, but I am the director.</i>

219
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:56,127
I dreamt that this happened.

220
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,833
And in my dream... 

221
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:02,270
 ... it was not as good as this.

222
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:05,969
What does it happen?

223
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,279
Why do you cry?

224
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,785
What does it happen?

225
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,516
I am afraid.

226
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,390
Why are you afraid?

227
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,931
Because I felt never so well.

228
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:34,696
Yes.

229
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,866
Everything will be well, affection.

230
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,210
Because I love you.

231
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,546
I will never allow to leave.

232
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,872
Where is the fellow?

233
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:44,272
He/she will already come.

234
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,935
<i > why don't you call it another time?</i>

235
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,411
Not I will call it other time.
I already called it.

236
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,414
If he/she said that he/she would come, he/she will come.

237
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,416
Have you already tried with him?

238
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,577
The last time we obtained it of him.

239
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:57,019
Yes, certain. It was very good.

240
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,522
Yes, tranquilize you.

241
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:03,221
Have you had sex lately?

242
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:04,694
And you what you believe?

243
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,561
And what there is of... 

244
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:08,861
 ... Jennifer?

245
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,459
- Julie.
- Julie. She is special.

246
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,299
It broke up with me.

247
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:17,971
- Did they leave twice, certain?
- Yes.

248
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:23,241
How it is that they broke
if they left only twice?

249
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,907
I don't know it, don't wonder to me.

250
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:27,577
I not even knew
that we were boyfriends.

251
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,120
You slept with her.

252
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:31,917
- For a girl, that is to be boyfriends.
- As you you say.

253
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:35,955
<i > What you asked him/her,
if you could shave him/her their parts?</i>

254
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,193
Did you ask it to him?

255
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,427
<i > Skies! You have an obsession
with the body hair!</i>

256
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,493
<i > "If I see it, I should come undone of him."</i>

257
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,437
Do you know what you could make? To look for
I use making depilation laser.

258
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,839
- Yes, clear.
- You would kill them with a ray.

259
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,740
Brilliant, perfect.

260
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,210
And well... 

261
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,678
Did it allow you to make it?

262
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,277
To shave it.

263
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,409
No!

264
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:04,421
He/she only gave me curiosity.

265
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,889
How do you begin that conversation?

266
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,518
You tell him/her: "Julie, you want
Merlot or Cabernet?

267
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:11,858
The one that you say.
Can I shave?".

268
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,160
Yes that are fond of joking today.
You are a real clown.

269
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:16,834
It is him.

270
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,233
Not he/she will come, certain?

271
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:20,396
Tell him/her that we will wait for it here.

272
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,766
Very well, yes.

273
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:27,944
Will he/she come?

274
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,106
It is delayed a little.

275
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,845
Don't tell me, delayed?
Yes, he/she has half hour of delay!

276
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,752
- Will he/she come or not?
- Yes.

277
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:37,880
Is it in road?

278
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:39,389
Yes. No.

279
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,983
It is in the process.
He/she is waiting their supplier.

280
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,584
What?!

281
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:45,527
He/she said that he/she is waiting
to their supplier.

282
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:48,065
Does he/she have it not even still?

283
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,691
Skies!

284
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:52,828
Why we don't go to their house
and do we wait with him?

285
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,701
Yes, how good idea.

286
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,638
Let us wait with him. What do you believe?

287
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,006
He/she has to prepare it
before selling us it!

288
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:00,544
He/she is the middleman!

289
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:03,410
This of waiting is garbage.

290
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:08,143
You are right.
You are right! Skies!

291
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,848
That infuriates me.

292
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:13,254
You call it and tell him/her that it cancels it.

293
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,725
No, not! Don't call it.
You would be as a fool!

294
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,762
There is somebody more
to who you can call?

295
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:23,428
It is 2:00 o'clock.
We are lucky that it is awake.

296
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:27,939
Do you know what? It serves a
little of vodka in your coffee and relax you.

297
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:30,440
You are here. You should be here.

298
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:31,840
Do you serve me browner?

299
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,340
Do you believe that boyfriend has?

300
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,612
I believe that he/she had boyfriend
but they broke.

301
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:42,346
He/she should have boyfriend.

302
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,448
At some time you did feel this way?

303
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,820
How?

304
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:24,157
Died inside.

305
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,823
Almost always.

306
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,332
I adored that girl.

307
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:38,900
<i > he/she loved Her more than to the life,
and that I obtained?</i>

308
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,609
What did I achieve?
That it ruined me.

309
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:48,780
<i > I Went mad. I lost the notion of the time.</i>

310
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:53,285
I went to Las Vegas thinking
that there he/she could forget it.

311
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:55,622
Yes that there are distractions in Las Vegas.

312
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,628
Yes, because it didn't work.

313
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:01,594
Do you know where I ended up?

314
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,635
I usually console myself
in the bed of another girl.

315
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,864
In a church, friend.

316
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,635
I regret it for you.

317
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:13,439
Yes, I spoke with a priest.
He/she helped me.

318
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,946
<i > what is that he/she helps you, brother.</i>

319
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,849
Levítico 24:17-18.

320
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,387
That that kills will restore.

321
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,685
<i > A life for another.</i>

322
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:28,892
It is well, friend.

323
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,053
You should leave. I am closing.

324
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:49,338
- To what does it distance The Ángel is?
- At one hour.

325
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:52,910
Is your car parked out?

326
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,815
Yes. It is very valuable for me.

327
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,354
It is beautiful.

328
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,291
Have, it conserves the change.

329
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,726
Thank you, friend.

330
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:11,599
- Not I listened your name.
- Neil.

331
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,503
He/she looks, Neil, lament
to have to make you this... 

332
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,336
 ... but I will have to take myself your car.

333
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,119
Thank you for the drinks.

334
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:43,451
Yes, affection.

335
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:46,156
<i > How are you, Nicky?</i>

336
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:48,961
Grandiose, friend.

337
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:50,467
And you, Sara?

338
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:53,003
I feel very well.

339
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:54,971
<i > it is This way.</i>

340
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:35,246
At some time you have been
with two fellows, Sara?

341
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,304
Already coarse!

342
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,884
- What will we eat?
- We will eat up each other.

343
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,583
Seriously, what will we order?

344
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,319
<i > Anything. Not you will want to eat.</i>

345
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,759
Then what we make here?

346
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,296
Alex likes illumination.

347
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:54,729
Yes, I like it. We will order juice.

348
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,892
<i > Juice?</i>

349
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:59,061
It achieves him to make you effect another time.
He/she gives you... 

350
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:01,901
<i > - A wave.
- Do they have enough I space there?</i>

351
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:03,531
We are very good friends.

352
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:05,508
I already see.

353
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,602
<i > What do they want?</i>

354
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,306
<i > Three orange juices.</i>

355
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,216
And what do they want to eat?

356
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:17,083
No, that is everything.

357
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:20,386
Only three juices
of orange, please.

358
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:23,188
Well, three orange juices.

359
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,029
It excuses. It excuses.

360
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:33,531
Another order!

361
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:36,231
Hello.

362
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:40,677
Can I wonder something?

363
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:43,942
Yes. But I am working.

364
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:46,916
He/she will only take one second.
They come here.

365
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:52,245
What does it happen?

366
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,257
Me only... 

367
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,522
Not I want you to think
that I am strange, but... 

368
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:03,431
I love your hair.

369
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:07,460
And I believe that you are very beautiful.

370
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,473
Are you drugged?

371
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:11,634
Is it evident?

372
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,438
Ecstasy?

373
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:16,810
It is my first time.

374
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,940
- At some time you did prove it?
- Yes.

375
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:24,649
They have more, but it is
in their apartment and... 

376
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:27,350
 ... I don't want to go there.

377
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,159
Unless you want to come.

378
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,989
I work up to 6:00 o'clock.
Who are?

379
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:39,435
They are owners of the club Sanctuary.
Can you take me to house?

380
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,505
I am working.

381
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:42,870
I will wait.

382
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,306
How do you call yourself?

383
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:45,774
Sara.

384
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,539
Where do you live?

385
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:48,612
In the valley.

386
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,840
I will call you a taxi.

387
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:52,041
No, I don't want to be alone.

388
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:55,108
And I no longer want to be with them.

389
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,355
Go!

390
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,791
Look at my eyes!

391
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:07,094
I love to feel this way.

392
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:12,663
I sit down...  tibia inside.

393
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:14,967
Very well.

394
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,734
Support this here.

395
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:22,871
Right here. Well.

396
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:24,437
Will.

397
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,545
Not I know if I want to make this.

398
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:33,651
You will be well.

399
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:57,847
<i > Well... </i>

400
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:03,352
Do you love me?

401
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,252
Yes.

402
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:21,866
<i > it Trusts me.</i>

403
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,306
I won't harm you.

404
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:30,679
Put this
around your right arm.

405
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:35,452
Pull it strong.

406
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,123
You are about to feel very well.

407
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:46,227
Very lukewarm.

408
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:49,261
Very lukewarm.

409
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:56,666
- Do you have boyfriend?
- No.

410
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:00,575
I love my boyfriend.

411
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:06,106
But I believe that I will break up with him.

412
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:10,587
But although he/she doesn't make it,
I still think... 

413
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:15,655
 ... that there is enough place in my
heart to love to more than a person.

414
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,153
I sometimes believe... 

415
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:22,722
 ... that the more I love... 

416
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,499
 ... more suffers.

417
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,300
Do you know?

418
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,170
Yes.

419
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:33,210
- I should return to work.
- Can I play your hair?

420
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:40,009
Sara, you are beautiful.
You are adorable.

421
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:44,753
I should...  I should leave.

422
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,318
Curse.

423
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:53,489
What?

424
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:59,359
I feel very stupid.

425
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:01,735
Not say that of yourself.

426
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:05,166
<i > Not you are stupid.</i>

427
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,491
Curse.

428
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,669
They come here. They come here.

429
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:12,302
Yes.

430
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:17,313
That is my girl.
That is my girl.

431
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:28,619
You believe that he/she shaves
their parts?

432
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:29,751
A little.

433
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:32,452
How that a little?

434
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,225
A little.

435
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,067
How that a little?
How do you know it?

436
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:43,768
Lies. When?

437
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:46,674
I came here one night without you.

438
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:50,145
We became horizontal.
He/she has a Brazilian grandiose style.

439
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,949
Is that to the front or behind?
How is the Brazilian?

440
00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:00,787
Brazilian, some body hair.
A little here up.

441
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:07,120
Yes, I am lying.
I am lying.

442
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:10,292
But it is never known
what could happen today.

443
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:26,382
<i > How can you think of the allotment?</i>

444
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,315
<i > we not even have a script!</i>

445
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:31,219
Don't worry about the script.
We will have it.

446
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:34,452
- To who do you see in those lists?
- I told you that I didn't still think it.

447
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,015
Me yes.

448
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:38,288
It doesn't fit me doubt.

449
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,796
The girl should have quality.

450
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,025
<i > Cliff. Cliff.</i>

451
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,464
It excuses.

452
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:47,666
Do they want to order?

453
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:52,505
Yes, coffee. Two coffees, black.

454
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,070
- Are you an actress?
- Why

455
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,811
We are preparing a movie.

456
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,908
Yes, something has made.

457
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:03,351
He is Allen Flock, the director.

458
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:06,584
I am Cliff McKee, the producer.

459
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:08,181
You are the important ones.

460
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:09,886
What performance class did you make?

461
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:12,589
Some plays.

462
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:14,688
<i > do you Have a sample tape?</i>

463
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:18,325
Even not.

464
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,233
About what is it the movie?

465
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:21,669
We are not still sure.

466
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,604
<i > you don't pay him/her attention.
He/she is the director.</i>

467
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:26,507
It tries on a girl
that he/she knows a boy, he/she falls in love... 

468
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,410
 ... and then he/she realizes that he is not
who she believed that it was.

469
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,678
<i > So it breaks up with him.
But he cannot accept it.</i>

470
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,811
He/she goes mad.

471
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,718
Go.

472
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,257
Do you know my former boyfriend?

473
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,228
Skies... 

474
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,377
You can take off it.

475
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:07,951
Well, tell me what it happened.

476
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,249
You what you believe?

477
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:13,813
Don't I know it, what did it happen?
Did you play?

478
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:16,189
They didn't give me the opportunity.

479
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:20,325
Why not?

480
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,457
They saw my arm.

481
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:26,498
Curse.

482
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,199
I sit down it, affection.

483
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:36,969
I sit down it. But it will leave well.

484
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:40,779
We are you and me against the world.
Did you know it?

485
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:43,947
Affection.

486
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,459
<i > Not it is so simple... </i>

487
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,587
<i >... but that it is the general idea.</i>

488
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,255
But I should say that you shine... 

489
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:58,029
 ... exactly like I imagined
to the girl of the movie.

490
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:59,501
<i > Truth, Allen?</i>

491
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:02,138
Yes, Cliff.

492
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:03,833
<i > do you Have an agent?</i>

493
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:05,170
Not at the moment.

494
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:06,436
Do you have a picture?

495
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,707
I will take them soon.
I will have them in two or three days.

496
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:14,149
Brilliant, soon we will choose to the allotment.
You should give me your number or... 

497
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:16,652
- To what time salts?
- Today?

498
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:18,052
Yes.

499
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,953
<i > I Work up to 6:00 o'clock.</i>

500
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,721
<i > Up to 6 o'clock: 00?
How late. Or how early.</i>

501
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:25,022
Today is not a good day.

502
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:27,564
Well, then give me your number.

503
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:28,962
Do you have a card?

504
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:32,525
Of course.
But not here with me.

505
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:51,484
It could have nudes.
Would you care that?

506
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:55,491
I suppose that not,
but I want to read the script.

507
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,686
- Yes, also me.
- Don't listen to it.

508
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:59,889
I am only the director.

509
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:03,092
If it was necessary, would you make it?
How is the scene?

510
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:06,261
Count him/her the scene.

511
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,008
There is a sequence... 

512
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:17,076
 ... in the one that the girl and their boyfriend
they became very addicted... 

513
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:22,175
 ... but they don't have money,
so her... 

514
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,585
<i >... he/she goes to bed with the trafficker.</i>

515
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:28,091
<i > it is important to show that.</i>

516
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,421
Not it is unnecessary.

517
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:30,858
Yes that is unnecessary.

518
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,260
No, it is not it. It is not it.

519
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,594
Is this the script?
Because I can read it... 

520
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,861
 ... and to tell them if I believe
that it is unnecessary or not.

521
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:40,335
We need reescribirlo a little.

522
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:41,962
We should polish it a little.

523
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:44,098
<i > Then we need
to get the money.</i>

524
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:46,643
I have the money to make
the movie. Don't listen to it.

525
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,678
I have the money.

526
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:50,771
If there were nudes... 

527
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:52,611
 ... would you have problems with that?

528
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,853
You believe that I could
to have problems with that?

529
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:01,255
<i > That is. That is their attitude.</i>

530
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:05,659
I will return at once
to take them the order.

531
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:33,414
Curse.

532
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:44,258
When he/she was boy he/she only bought
the cereal for the gift.

533
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,532
<i > he/she chose This way it.
Which he/she had the best gift.</i>

534
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:48,799
Will?

535
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:52,633
Yes?

536
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,701
What are we making?

537
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:56,541
What? What?
I am having breakfast.

538
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:59,515
I no longer want to make this.

539
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,983
Do you speak seriously? No, please.

540
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:03,542
<i > please, affection.</i>

541
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:06,112
Hope, I don't want to have
this conversation now.

542
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,283
Seriously you do want to make it?
I am spread in the floor... 

543
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,987
<i > I don't feel well. Now?</i>

544
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:12,460
Yes.

545
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,430
Very well, it is well.

546
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:19,498
Do you want more commitment?

547
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,865
Do you fear him to abandon you?

548
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,531
Because I am here, affection.

549
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:27,668
No, it is the conversation of
"I don't want to be a losing" addict.

550
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:29,838
Not I want to be pathetic. And you?

551
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:33,449
Is a tricky question?

552
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:41,349
You are an imbecile!
Not it is for this reason that I came here!

553
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:43,655
Not I know where they leave my days.

554
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,161
I sit down that my life doesn't have purpose.

555
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:51,260
Very well.

556
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:53,269
Curse.

557
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:55,532
Skies... 

558
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:58,407
I sit down as an old man.

559
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:03,043
Sit down. Sit down.

560
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:04,808
- No.
- Affection!

561
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:06,939
- Don't play me!
- Affection!

562
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:09,110
Not I have energy to put under an obligation.

563
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,122
What does it happen?

564
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:23,092
My mother used to say
that every minute of the day... 

565
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:27,263
 ... we were coming closer to God
or taking away from him.

566
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:30,102
I no longer know to what I come closer.

567
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,303
But even so you could
to release you of there, certain?

568
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,219
You don't believe in those things,
certain?

569
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:51,954
My father told me that when I was born... 

570
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:57,159
He was very poor all their life.

571
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:59,600
But he/she told me that when I was born... 

572
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,797
 ... he was very afraid... 

573
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:06,002
 ... of not being able to take care to itself
neither to me... 

574
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,772
 ... and that for that reason Will, "desire" called me.

575
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:13,715
Because he/she knew that if he/she had a desire... 

576
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:18,518
 ... he/she would always have... 

577
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:22,923
- A what an one?
- An exit.

578
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,551
Correct.

579
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,527
Do you want to drug yourself or what?

580
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:33,263
Not we have money.

581
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:37,637
I know it, but we have a desire.

582
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:40,440
If there is a desire... 

583
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:51,448
Yes.

584
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,547
Yes.

585
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:59,024
Do you want the candy?
Do you want it?

586
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:02,888
You look at me. Look at me!

587
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:06,031
Yes.

588
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:09,499
Yes!

589
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:19,471
Yes, curse!

590
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,075
You look at me. Look at me, yes!

591
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:26,589
He/she opens the eyes, curse.
Open them!

592
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:53,210
<i > Richard feels something solitary today.</i>

593
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:55,877
Let us let him to suffer a little.

594
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:58,012
Can I bring them something of drinking?

595
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,555
A cup of coffee.

596
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:01,887
Me, lemonade.

597
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:04,527
How do you call yourself?

598
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,358
Hope.

599
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,125
You are beautiful, Hope.

600
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:10,723
Thank you.

601
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:12,735
What are you making?

602
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:14,065
How do you say?

603
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:17,437
You should work here many hours.

604
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:19,738
<i > I Imagine that what you win... </i>

605
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:23,109
<i >... he/she doesn't help you to improve your situation
social or economic.</i>

606
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,479
Are you an applicant to actress?
Model?

607
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,245
I am cantautora.

608
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:31,287
And do you make money with that?

609
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:34,356
Even not.

610
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:37,951
I suppose that you were born
in the center-west.

611
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,093
In Cleveland.

612
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:42,394
You believed that you would be a great success... 

613
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,435
<i >... but you were
with many obstacles.</i>

614
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:48,130
<i > AND now you are waiting,
thinking in how to continue.</i>

615
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:50,931
I will achieve it.

616
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:21,704
I will make it.

617
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,106
<i > he/she Neglects. It is not always so bad.</i>

618
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:28,303
To me he/she told me the same thing
nine months ago.

619
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:30,107
<i > Not I can avoid it. You look at yourself.</i>

620
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,149
You are young, beautiful.
Not you belong to this place!

621
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:35,276
I told you that I will achieve it.

622
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:38,480
You need money.
It is that simple.

623
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:40,113
You can give me a great tip.

624
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:43,990
And it is clever. He/she looks... 

625
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:48,361
You would like to make a lot of money
in very little time?

626
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:50,866
Of what do you speak?

627
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:53,402
Mine, tell him/her of what I speak.

628
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:58,271
<i > last week
I won $ 13,000 dollars cash... </i>

629
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:00,037
 ... tax-free.

630
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:03,669
<i > I direct a service.</i>

631
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:05,214
What service?

632
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:07,079
People's of first level service.

633
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:10,449
We assist to movie stars,
athletes, managers of studies... 

634
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,648
 ... musical producers.

635
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,989
<i > I have just bought a house
in Hollywood Hills.</i>

636
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,688
I drive a 500 CO.LTD.,
I make purchases in the street Rodeo.

637
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:21,993
I am a damned rock star.

638
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:26,598
Allow me to see if I understand.

639
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,570
You say that I will never be successful... 

640
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,130
 ... so I should open him/her the legs
to the best bidder.

641
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:33,267
And if I am lucky,
one of my clients... 

642
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:35,743
 ... if this way the flames,
it will be a musical producer... 

643
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:38,576
 ... that he/she will give me the opportunity
that I really want.

644
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:40,640
<i > Affection, I don't want to insult you.</i>

645
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:42,378
<i > you should be an excellent music.</i>

646
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:44,716
<i > I reacted equally, Hope.</i>

647
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:48,417
<i > But there is a quantity
of determined time... </i>

648
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:51,950
 ... in the life of a woman
in which the stars favor it.

649
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:56,094
You should consider it.

650
00:48:57,701 --> 00:48:59,566
<i > you Have my card.</i>

651
00:48:59,636 --> 00:49:02,696
<i > If you want that we see each other
to take coffee... </i>

652
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,468
<i >... we could speak... </i>

653
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:07,908
<i >... on an opportunity of businesses
very lucrative.</i>

654
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:12,306
All sell something.

655
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:15,317
<i > Not you wait
until it is too much afternoon.</i>

656
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,966
<i > Not I know what they want.</i>

657
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:36,733
<i > I gave Them everything, my heart,
my mind, everything... </i>

658
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,502
They still reject me.

659
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:41,908
An imbecile said that only
the losers renounce.

660
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:45,471
To the devil with that.
I can no longer make it.

661
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:01,021
<i > Carrie, Carrie.</i>

662
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:03,931
<i > I am Vince.
He/she answers if you are there!</i>

663
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,559
- Give me that.
- Curse!

664
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:09,469
The last time that you made this,
three of your former fiancés called me... 

665
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:12,997
 ... and they told me: You called "me
at 3:00" o'clock. Not be this way.

666
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:14,100
What does it happen?

667
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,201
I went to the bathroom... 

668
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:18,770
<i >... and this imbecile takes my telephone
and he/she begins to make calls... </i>

669
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,646
Can you be quiet for one second?

670
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:22,685
Do they know something of the fellow?

671
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:24,345
No.

672
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:26,480
He/she will call us.

673
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:28,524
Do you have some contact?

674
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:34,989
He/she calls to this number... 

675
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:37,192
 ... and tell him/her that you know me... 

676
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:41,567
 ... and he/she will bring them what you/they want.
Tell him/her that he/she brings me the usual thing.

677
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:45,301
<i > I Believed that you no longer consumed.
Do you consume another time?</i>

678
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,469
No, it is not for me,
it is for a friend.

679
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:15,871
<i > Hello.</i>

680
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:19,671
Skies, you scared me.

681
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,438
I sit down it.

682
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,579
Why do you work at night?

683
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:27,879
It is November 2.

684
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:30,111
And what with that?

685
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:32,951
It is a Mexican festivity.

686
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:39,458
What thing?

687
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:41,019
The day of the deads.

688
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,896
It is perfect.

689
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:46,600
What?

690
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:48,001
Anything.

691
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:54,204
Keith said that you were a good music.

692
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:57,276
<i > How does that go?</i>

693
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:00,146
You what you believe?

694
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:02,910
I believe that anything well.

695
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:05,250
Yes.

696
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:07,415
<i > What does it stop you?</i>

697
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:19,029
Why nobody never
does he/she want to be where it is?

698
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:22,162
It is bad that he/she wants to be
more than a waiter... 

699
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:24,400
 ... in this hell
for the rest of my life?

700
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,409
No.

701
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:31,243
<i > I sit down It, but I went by things
very bad in the past.</i>

702
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,248
And I try to accommodate my life.

703
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,750
Not I need you to bother me.

704
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:39,112
Do you fear to the death?

705
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:42,422
What?

706
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:45,393
If you fear to the death.

707
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:47,089
What devils does it happen tonight?

708
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,758
I sit down as if it was
among crazy.

709
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:53,200
It is well,
it was only a question.

710
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,402
Why do you ask it?

711
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:02,602
For curiosity.

712
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,070
And you?

713
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:12,646
No. No, I don't fear him/her.

714
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:14,189
Perhaps you don't fear him/her... 

715
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:16,384
 ... because you believe that you don't have
anything why to live.

716
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:20,053
Why do you say that?

717
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:24,533
Why you believe that I don't have
why to live?

718
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:26,899
Did I only come to smoke, is it well?

719
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,699
Not I wanted to bother you.

720
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:30,296
<i > it is that a lot of time passed... </i>

721
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:33,274
<i >... trying to be in a place
different from the one that was... </i>

722
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:36,335
 ... trying to be somebody different.

723
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:39,644
<i > AND he/she believed that if he/she had
the life of that fellow... </i>

724
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:43,777
 ... or their money that would be happy.

725
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:49,488
And that pursued me for a lot of time.
It is everything.

726
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:53,055
Which are your dreams?

727
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:58,196
I never dreamt of using
a net for the hair.

728
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:03,836
But here I am.

729
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,966
Perhaps everything happened... 

730
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:09,671
 ... so that I was here
speaking with you.

731
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:20,552
<i > you should know... 
that you are beautiful... </i>

732
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:25,057
<i >... as well as you are.
Here and now.</i>

733
00:54:26,863 --> 00:54:28,797
Not I know from what you escape.

734
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:08,599
Will?

735
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,098
Will?

736
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:14,569
Will!

737
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:17,579
Will! Will!

738
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:18,773
<i > What?</i>

739
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:21,373
We will kill ourselves!

740
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,078
Yes, and what?

741
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,425
<i > he/she Hears!</i>

742
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:36,660
What devils... ?

743
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:42,934
I want you to release yourself!

744
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:50,410
Skies... 

745
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:53,679
Not it is certain.

746
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,377
Yes, it is certain!

747
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:10,326
It is well.

748
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:17,269
Then you give me 30 days
of notice?

749
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,175
Two weeks?

750
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:21,904
I want you to release yourself of here!

751
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:23,468
Veto of here!

752
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,878
Damned bastard! Veto to the hell!

753
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,382
Release you of... 

754
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:16,858
Do you want browner?

755
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:23,136
You want to order
or do you continue waiting?

756
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:27,105
It is well. Everything will come out well.

757
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:30,408
Not it is certain.
It will never leave well.

758
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,708
Why do you say it?

759
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:39,652
John was right.

760
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:41,383
What?

761
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:45,456
John was right.

762
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:47,052
Was John right on what?

763
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,758
God doesn't exist.
Not there is religion.

764
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:54,361
- John that said?
- He/she said it to Paul.

765
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:55,495
Who is Paul?

766
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:59,038
McCartney.

767
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,611
Then, John Lennon?

768
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:06,806
Who was he?

769
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:11,411
- One of Beatles.
- No. Who was?

770
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:14,079
I don't know it, you tell it to me.

771
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:17,888
They killed him! Why did they kill him?

772
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:21,055
I don't know it, it was Mark David something.
He shot him/her.

773
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:23,325
No, not. Not it was him.

774
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:24,627
I am sure that yes.

775
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:27,397
No, it was another person!

776
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,172
It is well.

777
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,540
I am worried by you.

778
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,812
Are you worried by me?

779
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:40,175
<i > Of what do you speak?</i>

780
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,184
Of Will.

781
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:45,720
Do You Know Will? How?

782
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:50,554
Are you still in love of him?

783
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:55,698
Why... ? How do you know it?

784
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:01,531
No longer. I mean... 

785
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:04,129
I am no longer with him.

786
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:09,572
You are getting scared!

787
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:11,546
Not end up as me.

788
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:14,749
What?

789
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:16,114
I am hungry.

790
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:21,782
I will eat cake of nuts
with ice cream.

791
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:27,625
Will will return.

792
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:31,264
Will will always return.

793
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:26,781
Can I enter?

794
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:36,097
Lament that happened. Is it well?

795
01:00:36,165 --> 01:00:39,100
Not I wanted...  You already know... 

796
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:43,000
I should leave.
Not I can speak to you now.

797
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:45,939
Please, don't return.

798
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:49,135
You know... 

799
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:53,472
<i > Yes... </i>

800
01:00:58,621 --> 01:01:01,146
You know, me only...  You know... 

801
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,954
To where is it supposed that he/she goes?

802
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:10,797
What I should make
when I sit down this way?

803
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,035
I cannot tell it to you.

804
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:18,807
I only know... 

805
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:20,172
What do you know?

806
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:23,041
I know that we don't become well.

807
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:26,707
<i > But you said that never
you had felt so well... </i>

808
01:01:26,783 --> 01:01:28,717
 ... with others as you felt with me.

809
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:31,854
I know it.

810
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:33,650
What is there with that?

811
01:01:33,723 --> 01:01:37,250
Not I can tell it to you. I don't know it.

812
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:02,678
Not I want to live without you, Hope.

813
01:02:02,752 --> 01:02:05,220
Not say that. Not you speak seriously.

814
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:07,415
<i > I Speak seriously! Very seriously!</i>

815
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:11,085
Not I can live with you.
Not I want to live without you.

816
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:14,152
Not you can come and to make me this.

817
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,891
Not you can make me this.

818
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:55,317
What do you make here?

819
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,693
I came to see you.

820
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:00,228
I told you that you didn't make it.

821
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:03,288
You already know that I am not good listener.

822
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,497
God willing you had not come.

823
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:11,870
If he/she had been able to avoid it,
he/she would have made it.

824
01:05:14,176 --> 01:05:15,473
I am working.

825
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:17,739
Hope, don't give my back!

826
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:19,007
Not it is a good moment!

827
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:21,845
Are you my waiter, certain?

828
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,853
<i > you are here to serve me.</i>

829
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:29,215
Well. What do you want?

830
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:31,920
To you.

831
01:05:35,464 --> 01:05:36,692
Not we will make this.

832
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,631
Of course.

833
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:40,362
Please don't go mad.

834
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:42,836
I won't make it.

835
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:44,736
Why are you here?
What do you make?

836
01:05:44,807 --> 01:05:46,798
He/she wanted to come to tell you... 

837
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:48,503
 ... that I feel better.

838
01:05:48,577 --> 01:05:50,477
Well.

839
01:05:50,546 --> 01:05:52,946
You are speaking to me
with superiority, don't make it.

840
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:55,074
Not I want to spend for this reason another time.

841
01:05:58,087 --> 01:06:00,749
I am no longer who you believe.

842
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:03,883
Now I have a purpose.

843
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,188
I have a focus.

844
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:08,594
Grandiose. What do you want to eat?

845
01:06:08,664 --> 01:06:10,222
Not you do want to know what it is?

846
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:12,426
No. I am happy for you,
but I am working.

847
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:13,763
Do you want to order or not?

848
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:19,773
Clear. You know what I like,
order me something.

849
01:06:19,842 --> 01:06:21,969
But you can sit down
for one second?

850
01:06:22,044 --> 01:06:23,671
Don't give my back!

851
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:25,611
<i > Friend, do you have some problem?</i>

852
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:29,284
What?

853
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:30,352
Do you have some problem?

854
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,319
Not I am speaking with you.

855
01:06:35,024 --> 01:06:36,491
Because me yes I am speaking with you.

856
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:42,926
Friend, you would not want
to bother me now.

857
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,523
What will you make in this respect?

858
01:06:55,144 --> 01:06:56,702
Be quiet, imbecile.

859
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,375
What?

860
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:04,317
Be quiet, imbecile and date turn.

861
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:07,622
Do you listen the rude fellow?

862
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:10,124
Not make a scene.
Not make a scene.

863
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:11,523
What?

864
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:13,152
Not make a scene!

865
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:15,527
I am not making a scene,
he is making it!

866
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:18,396
Do we already calm down, is it well?

867
01:07:23,572 --> 01:07:27,008
Hello. What do you look?

868
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:28,543
Sit down!

869
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:31,205
Which your problem is!
He/she leaves alone people.

870
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,646
Vince, can you calm down?

871
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:36,651
Vince, I don't want to repeat it,
is it well?

872
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,949
<i > Vince, is well.</i>

873
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:42,381
 ... only... 

874
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:44,153
We go, we go, we go.

875
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:52,323
This will finish in one
in two ways.

876
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:56,736
I believe that you should speak with me.

877
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:58,865
You are crazy!

878
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:01,102
You need me.

879
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:03,538
You know that yes.

880
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:04,806
You suffocate me.

881
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,440
To what do you refer?

882
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:09,780
Why do you make this?
Look at you!

883
01:08:09,852 --> 01:08:11,911
You requested me space, I gave you space!

884
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:14,182
You requested me time,
I gave you time!

885
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:16,850
Affection, I traveled from very far.
Speak to me, please!

886
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:18,723
<i > Which is the problem, colleague?</i>

887
01:08:18,794 --> 01:08:21,558
What?

888
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:25,396
Do you have some problem, colleague?

889
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:28,369
If I have a problem, "colleague?"
No, I don't have none.

890
01:08:36,745 --> 01:08:38,940
Am I here the cretin one?

891
01:08:39,014 --> 01:08:42,609
<i > Not I want to be the cretin one. Me only... </i>

892
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:44,482
I can take borrowed
to their waiter?

893
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:46,282
<i > we Need to speak.</i>

894
01:08:46,355 --> 01:08:47,720
I hope they understand. Me... 

895
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,559
The master a lot.

896
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:55,721
She will be fantastic in the movie.

897
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,288
The fellow is crazy.

898
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:59,334
Are all of agreement?

899
01:09:03,038 --> 01:09:05,302
I can request you... 

900
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:09,504
 ... a minute of time
to speak?

901
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:17,950
Do you see that I make for you?
I put on in ridiculous.

902
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:19,020
I already see.

903
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:20,851
You are crazy!

904
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:26,254
Why? Because I love you?

905
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:30,162
Then yes, if that is madness,
I am very crazy.

906
01:09:30,232 --> 01:09:32,700
I lost the head. Flipé.

907
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:40,304
Skies, you are beautiful.

908
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:46,608
I love you so much.

909
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:53,319
If you loved me, you would not be
making this.

910
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:55,220
- What thing?
- This.

911
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:57,316
I try to recompose my life.

912
01:09:57,393 --> 01:09:59,020
I try to return to the normality.

913
01:09:59,094 --> 01:10:00,561
Do you miss me, certain?

914
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:03,956
We go, you know that yes.

915
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:05,967
Of course.

916
01:10:07,403 --> 01:10:11,806
Please, affection. Let us leave of here.

917
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:13,865
Where would we go?
What would we make?

918
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:17,879
I don't know it.
We can begin of zero... 

919
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:19,981
 ... in another place.

920
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:22,643
Not I want to begin of zero.

921
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:25,444
Why not?

922
01:10:25,521 --> 01:10:28,388
Because I am beginning
of zero here and I need money.

923
01:10:28,457 --> 01:10:30,857
- Don't worry for that reason.
- I worry.

924
01:10:30,926 --> 01:10:32,757
No. I already took charge of that.

925
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:34,318
How did you take charge?

926
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:37,854
Don't worry about the money.
I will take charge.

927
01:10:37,933 --> 01:10:39,025
No.

928
01:10:41,203 --> 01:10:42,795
Yes, Hope.

929
01:10:42,871 --> 01:10:47,604
I can give you what you want,
you know it!

930
01:10:47,676 --> 01:10:49,405
What do you want?
What do you need?

931
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:54,811
I want their career like singer.
Their money... 

932
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:57,647
 ... and a paper in the movie
of that fellow.

933
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:00,052
<i > How they sound, how they shine,
what you/they transmit. Your voice... </i>

934
01:11:00,122 --> 01:11:02,647
<i > Hope, your voice is exceptional.</i>

935
01:11:02,725 --> 01:11:06,024
<i > AND the songs.
The third, that of the tree.</i>

936
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:07,119
<i > hanging Tree?</i>

937
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:08,288
He/she smells me of success.

938
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:10,924
Thank You, Malcolm.
Do you speak seriously?

939
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,059
Of course.
The world will know... 

940
01:11:13,135 --> 01:11:14,261
Do they want to order?

941
01:11:15,371 --> 01:11:16,770
We are busy.

942
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:18,739
<i > can you return in some minutes?</i>

943
01:11:18,807 --> 01:11:20,104
I already see. What do they want?

944
01:11:21,143 --> 01:11:22,770
Three orange juices.

945
01:11:23,879 --> 01:11:25,244
<i > AND to eat?</i>

946
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:28,839
No, that is everything.

947
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:31,317
Very well. Three orange juices.

948
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:32,479
<i > Cliff? Cliff?</i>

949
01:11:32,554 --> 01:11:33,885
It excuses.

950
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:38,554
- Are you an actress?
- Why?

951
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:40,594
We are preparing a movie.

952
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:43,131
No, I am cantautora.

953
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:45,223
I am a damned rock star.

954
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:47,925
Allow me to see if I understand.

955
01:11:48,003 --> 01:11:50,096
<i > you Say that I will never be successful... </i>

956
01:11:50,172 --> 01:11:53,437
<i >... so I should open him/her the legs
to the best bidder.</i>

957
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:55,500
Do you want browner?

958
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,745
Do you want to order?

959
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,854
I am joking.
Not I want you to make anything for me.

960
01:12:06,922 --> 01:12:10,323
Well. He/she listens. We can begin
of zero here if that wants.

961
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:11,654
No.

962
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:13,319
Yes, Hope!

963
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:15,386
<i > Now I am different.</i>

964
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:17,364
Not it is certain.

965
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:18,695
Curse!

966
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:20,667
<i > Hope, don't make me this.
Please!</i>

967
01:12:20,736 --> 01:12:24,069
- Is everything very here?
- Yes, everything is well.

968
01:12:24,139 --> 01:12:26,437
No, it is not certain.
Are you the manager?

969
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:27,975
It is this way.

970
01:12:28,043 --> 01:12:31,501
I will tell it to you. This is their last night.

971
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:32,877
Don't listen to it.

972
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:34,848
You don't need this garbage.

973
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:37,385
They were lucky
that you worked here.

974
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:41,116
Don't play it! Seriously.

975
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,316
Don't play it!

976
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:44,518
I will have to request you
that you leave.

977
01:12:44,593 --> 01:12:47,187
Yes? Because I won't leave.

978
01:12:47,262 --> 01:12:50,390
Then I will call to the Police.

979
01:12:50,466 --> 01:12:54,027
He/she also calls to the forensic surgeon, then.

980
01:12:54,103 --> 01:12:57,664
You go to... ? Do you see what happens?
Curse!

981
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,675
<i > is it well?!</i>

982
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:03,837
<i > it Lowers the damned telephone!
That is.</i>

983
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:10,582
What?

984
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:11,846
Do you see it?

985
01:13:12,988 --> 01:13:14,683
Very well!

986
01:13:14,757 --> 01:13:17,521
<i > All put their damned hands
on the table!</i>

987
01:13:17,593 --> 01:13:19,993
<i > Now! On the table.</i>

988
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:22,860
Put the hands visible!
Is it well?

989
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:24,728
Hands in the table visible!

990
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,760
Hear, affection, be quiet!

991
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:31,931
Be quiet! I will kill them to all!

992
01:13:32,007 --> 01:13:34,532
I swear him! Is it well? What?

993
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:36,510
- I am well.
- Well, you are well.

994
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:38,409
<i > - Well.
- Silence!</i>

995
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,471
I didn't ask them them to speak.

996
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:44,952
Allow me to think for one minute.
Allow me to think.

997
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:50,352
You, the manager. How do you call yourself?

998
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:51,984
Keith.

999
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:56,394
Keith. He/she closes the front door.
With key.

1000
01:13:56,465 --> 01:13:58,262
<i > he/she Takes the keys and he/she closes the door.</i>

1001
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:00,028
Will, please.

1002
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:01,626
Don't make it.

1003
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:04,103
<i > The hands! What do you make?</i>

1004
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:08,975
Please! What... ?
Not make this.

1005
01:14:09,044 --> 01:14:11,137
You go over there. What?

1006
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:12,942
Not make this!
What do you make?

1007
01:14:13,015 --> 01:14:15,745
You didn't give me option.

1008
01:14:15,818 --> 01:14:18,286
I gave you the option
and you didn't give me none.

1009
01:14:18,353 --> 01:14:21,220
Not I can speak now of this.
I am busy.

1010
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:22,552
Where do you go?

1011
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:24,216
To close the door.

1012
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:26,158
Will you close it there out?

1013
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:30,827
Well. We go. Give me the keys.

1014
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:35,061
Very well. We go.

1015
01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:42,505
Very well. Now see to close
the back door.

1016
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:45,775
He/she returns or I will kill
to all, is it well?

1017
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:48,817
Ten, nine, eight... 

1018
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:51,785
 ... seven, six, five... 

1019
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:53,378
Make what says, Hope.

1020
01:14:54,056 --> 01:14:56,718
What?

1021
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:58,282
I gave what you have just said.

1022
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:01,124
Please you speak to him/her
when he/she returns.

1023
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:03,596
Tell him/her something. Keith!

1024
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:07,393
You are not my manager, is it well?

1025
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:11,239
He/she leaves... 

1026
01:15:13,876 --> 01:15:15,503
What do you make?
What is this?

1027
01:15:15,577 --> 01:15:17,169
Anything.

1028
01:15:17,246 --> 01:15:19,714
Yes, colleague?
I find a telephone!

1029
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:24,781
All put the content
of their pockets on the table.

1030
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:30,720
<i > AND put their hands in the head
with the crisscross fingers.</i>

1031
01:15:32,928 --> 01:15:34,156
<i > Hope!</i>

1032
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:35,526
Hope, where are you?

1033
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:40,696
It takes out the inspector's money.
It takes out the money.

1034
01:15:40,769 --> 01:15:44,170
<i > you Give the imbecile a bag
and give another to me.</i>

1035
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:46,104
Give me the keys. No, have them.

1036
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:48,566
Open it.

1037
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:51,807
<i > you Give a bag to me
and another to him.</i>

1038
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:02,151
What do you look?

1039
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:04,215
Why don't you stop me to look?

1040
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:06,420
<i > it is a madness! Do you want to go to prison?</i>

1041
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:10,261
<i > Not we want problems, friend.</i>

1042
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:13,665
Be quiet, cretin!
Are these those subject of the movie?

1043
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:15,362
<i > No, leave them alone!</i>

1044
01:16:15,437 --> 01:16:17,905
<i > they Only want to sleep with you
Hope! Don't you understand it?</i>

1045
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:19,941
Is certain not?
Do you want to go to bed with her?

1046
01:16:20,008 --> 01:16:21,441
No.

1047
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:24,911
You are a liar!
You lie the whole time!

1048
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:29,073
How's it going if I fly you
the brain manipulator... 

1049
01:16:29,151 --> 01:16:30,914
 ... on the table?

1050
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:40,459
There you have your damned script!

1051
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:42,258
<i > it is well, I am well.</i>

1052
01:16:43,165 --> 01:16:44,632
Very well.

1053
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:47,692
Well... 

1054
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:51,865
Well. The hands! The hands!

1055
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:55,376
Behind of the head!
The head! Quickly.

1056
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:58,311
How do you go with the money?

1057
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:01,076
He/she takes their things. Wallets,
clocks and money.

1058
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:03,049
You won't go out yourself with yours.

1059
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:04,118
Do you speak seriously?

1060
01:17:04,186 --> 01:17:05,653
It is a madness!

1061
01:17:05,721 --> 01:17:07,882
Of what do you speak?
I am making it for you!

1062
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:11,551
Be quiet! Make it! Skies!

1063
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:14,425
<i > you Give me the money!
Give me the money!</i>

1064
01:17:14,496 --> 01:17:15,554
Give me the money.

1065
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:20,629
Take it.

1066
01:17:20,702 --> 01:17:22,567
Here you have. Here you have.

1067
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,970
Take it and veto!

1068
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,907
Of what do you speak?
You will come with me.

1069
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:29,568
Not I will go.

1070
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,572
Veto.

1071
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,617
Do you know what?

1072
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:37,447
<i > you can come with me
as my girlfriend... </i>

1073
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:39,612
 ... or I eat my hostage.

1074
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:41,121
<i > Not! No!</i>

1075
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:42,679
What does he/she differ there is?

1076
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:46,319
If there is a difference?
How devils you can... ?

1077
01:17:46,395 --> 01:17:47,862
How can you say that?

1078
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:49,760
After all that we live?

1079
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:51,526
Because you are crazy!

1080
01:17:53,068 --> 01:17:55,696
Not you have neither he/she devises.

1081
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:57,261
I won't fear you.

1082
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:59,830
Kill me if you want.
I won't fear you!

1083
01:17:59,908 --> 01:18:02,001
I won't give you that pleasure!

1084
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:09,783
Which is your problem?

1085
01:18:09,851 --> 01:18:11,546
<i > do you Have some problem?</i>

1086
01:18:14,556 --> 01:18:17,184
Should maybe take it to me to her.

1087
01:18:17,259 --> 01:18:20,524
I will take it to me. Do you want him to make it?
Does he/she make you feel better?

1088
01:18:20,595 --> 01:18:22,995
Affection, do you want to come with me?

1089
01:18:23,065 --> 01:18:25,625
<i > we See. Apparently, it is adorable.</i>

1090
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:28,226
We could have a good time.
We shine very together.

1091
01:18:28,303 --> 01:18:29,964
I will go with you. Leave alone it.

1092
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:31,369
What could make him/her.

1093
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:34,034
Leave alone it! I will go with you.

1094
01:18:34,109 --> 01:18:35,974
Very well.

1095
01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:40,342
Very well... 

1096
01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:44,476
Lament to interrupt their foods.

1097
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:47,215
I suggest them that they don't move... 

1098
01:18:47,289 --> 01:18:50,520
 ... until we have left.

1099
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,526
<i > Curse!</i>

1100
01:18:55,597 --> 01:18:57,963
What devils did you make? Go!

1101
01:18:58,033 --> 01:18:59,364
<i > What devils did you make?</i>

1102
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:01,026
Not I made anything!

1103
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:02,900
<i > Below! Below! Curse!</i>

1104
01:19:02,971 --> 01:19:05,439
How devils will we leave of here?

1105
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:11,245
Curse!

1106
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:13,110
<i > Curse, curse!</i>

1107
01:19:13,181 --> 01:19:14,773
How devils will we leave of here?

1108
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:17,512
The back door!
Do you have the keys?

1109
01:19:19,221 --> 01:19:21,052
You have the keys
of the back door?

1110
01:19:21,123 --> 01:19:22,556
I gave them to you.

1111
01:19:22,624 --> 01:19:26,583
Did you give them to me?
I don't have them!

1112
01:19:26,661 --> 01:19:28,253
<i > Who does have the keys?</i>

1113
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:29,558
Who does have the keys?

1114
01:19:30,632 --> 01:19:32,532
<i > Curse!</i>

1115
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:35,092
<i > you told to somebody that called
to the Police?</i>

1116
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:36,364
No.

1117
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:37,962
Why would you make something like that?

1118
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:39,131
Not I called to anybody.

1119
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:44,207
- You are a damned liar!
- Not I called to anybody.

1120
01:19:58,727 --> 01:20:02,788
The damned telephone responds!
That nobody moves!

1121
01:20:02,864 --> 01:20:04,798
<i > The hands on the head!</i>

1122
01:20:04,866 --> 01:20:06,629
Hello?

1123
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:10,131
<i > Yes.</i>

1124
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:13,270
<i > Yes.</i>

1125
01:20:14,209 --> 01:20:15,870
Yes.

1126
01:20:17,012 --> 01:20:19,003
They want to speak with you.

1127
01:20:20,415 --> 01:20:23,282
Seriously? Don't tell me!

1128
01:20:23,351 --> 01:20:25,478
You should speak with them.

1129
01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:30,687
Why? Why?

1130
01:20:30,759 --> 01:20:33,353
So that they can negotiate
a treatment?

1131
01:20:33,428 --> 01:20:36,329
So that they use their psychology?
Maybe call to my mother... 

1132
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:39,799
 ... and they make it come to speak to me for
last time. What do you believe, Hope?

1133
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:44,328
They will ask me him to leave free
to some people.

1134
01:20:44,406 --> 01:20:47,603
I know the game. They will leave me
to think that I have the control... 

1135
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:50,076
 ... while they drift
how to fly my head!

1136
01:20:53,114 --> 01:20:54,843
No, thank you. No.

1137
01:20:56,885 --> 01:21:01,049
Tell them that they forget it. And tell them that
if the telephone sounds another time... 

1138
01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:02,987
 ... I will kill somebody.

1139
01:21:06,761 --> 01:21:08,524
Not he/she wants to speak to him/her.

1140
01:21:08,597 --> 01:21:10,428
Tell them.

1141
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:14,525
<i > he/she Says that if they call again,
that it will kill somebody.</i>

1142
01:21:14,603 --> 01:21:16,070
It hangs the telephone.

1143
01:21:22,143 --> 01:21:25,135
<i > we Need him to lower their weapon!</i>

1144
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:28,239
<i > it Puts the hands on the head
and abandon the building!</i>

1145
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:32,319
What are you making?

1146
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:33,718
Not it is too much afternoon.

1147
01:21:33,788 --> 01:21:35,847
Seriously?

1148
01:21:38,026 --> 01:21:39,789
Listen to them.

1149
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:45,833
What devils? Get up!

1150
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:49,200
What devils did I tell them?
Behind. Curse!

1151
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:57,704
<i > Curse!</i>

1152
01:22:03,184 --> 01:22:04,651
Veto to the hell!

1153
01:22:26,174 --> 01:22:27,971
I didn't make that.
You forced me.

1154
01:22:28,043 --> 01:22:31,069
Affection, is certain, it is my blame.

1155
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:33,706
Don't made a mistake, Hope,
is it well?

1156
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:36,250
Affection, give me the weapon.

1157
01:22:36,318 --> 01:22:38,513
No, I won't give you the weapon!

1158
01:22:38,586 --> 01:22:40,520
Be quiet! Be quiet for one second!

1159
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:45,391
I know how to leave of here.
Let us go, they already come!

1160
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:48,122
Very well that nobody makes
anything stupid.

1161
01:22:51,366 --> 01:22:53,357
What?

1162
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:54,925
What devils faces?

1163
01:22:55,003 --> 01:22:57,062
We can leave for that window.

1164
01:22:57,138 --> 01:22:59,003
And if they come us?

1165
01:22:59,074 --> 01:23:00,098
They won't see each other.

1166
01:23:00,175 --> 01:23:01,540
Yes? And if they make it?

1167
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:03,076
I will be your hostage.

1168
01:23:04,946 --> 01:23:09,815
Then you are not mad
because I killed the woman?

1169
01:23:09,884 --> 01:23:13,081
Not he/she was a happy woman.
You did him/her a favor.

1170
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:18,451
Will you come with me as my girlfriend?

1171
01:23:18,526 --> 01:23:22,622
How he/she could not love
to somebody willing to die for me?

1172
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:26,929
Affection, I love you. I love you so much.

1173
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:29,163
I love you. I wish you so much.

1174
01:23:29,237 --> 01:23:30,636
I love you, affection.

1175
01:23:30,705 --> 01:23:33,765
I want to make you love.
I will make it to you!

1176
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:34,968
God.

1177
01:23:36,711 --> 01:23:39,111
I wish you so much.

1178
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:41,114
Affection, we should leave of here!

1179
01:23:42,717 --> 01:23:43,809
We should release ourselves!

1180
01:23:43,885 --> 01:23:45,182
You are right.

1181
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:48,322
You are right. Cover the eyes.

1182
01:23:59,968 --> 01:24:01,299
Curse!

1183
01:24:04,739 --> 01:24:05,865
Give me the weapon.

1184
01:24:10,412 --> 01:24:11,970
No.

1185
01:24:16,351 --> 01:24:18,046
I believed that we were together another time.

1186
01:24:22,424 --> 01:24:24,688
What will you make, to shoot me?

1187
01:24:27,796 --> 01:24:30,264
Do you know what? Not you would be capable.

1188
01:24:33,668 --> 01:24:35,499
Not you can kill me.

1189
01:24:37,605 --> 01:24:40,233
Don't tell me what I can make!

1190
01:24:40,308 --> 01:24:43,675
He/she stops to be a damned dog
and give me the weapon, Hope!

1191
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:59,291
Hello, Billy. They are Vince and Rob.

1192
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,588
How's it going, friend?

1193
01:25:00,662 --> 01:25:01,993
Rob.

1194
01:25:02,063 --> 01:25:03,257
What do they need?

1195
01:25:03,331 --> 01:25:04,798
A hundred dollars.

1196
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:13,965
How are you?

1197
01:25:14,042 --> 01:25:15,202
Well. And you?

1198
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:20,813
Have a good time.

1199
01:25:20,882 --> 01:25:21,906
Very well, friend.

1200
01:25:32,494 --> 01:25:34,553
<i > it is made This way, friend. Health.</i>

1201
01:25:36,097 --> 01:25:38,088
- He/she calms down, he/she calms down.
- Already coarse!

1202
01:26:19,741 --> 01:26:22,107
Awake!

1203
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:25,510
He/she hears, he/she hears. Are you awake?

1204
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:33,281
Tell to Keith that I will take out it of here.

1205
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:40,250
Will we stand up, is it well?
Put your arm here.

1206
01:26:54,776 --> 01:26:56,869
Yes, it is well, I am lying.

1207
01:26:56,945 --> 01:27:00,346
But it is never known
what could happen today.

1208
01:27:00,415 --> 01:27:03,043
It is in the bathroom.
He/she has an overdose.

1209
01:27:03,117 --> 01:27:04,880
Thomas will take out it of here.

1210
01:27:04,953 --> 01:27:07,979
Did he/she return with those fellows?
I don't like them.

1211
01:27:10,658 --> 01:27:12,091
Damned Hope.

1212
01:27:14,662 --> 01:27:18,496
Do you have money? Yes, I imagined it.

1213
01:29:07,408 --> 01:29:09,899
Where do you take me?

1214
01:29:09,977 --> 01:29:14,311
He/she neglects, you will be well.
Only relax you.

1215
01:29:30,231 --> 01:29:32,358
I made the same thing, you know.

1216
01:29:36,771 --> 01:29:38,898
He/she ran in circles... 

1217
01:29:38,973 --> 01:29:42,431
 ... looking for something that I was filled.

1218
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:49,746
I realized that
it only escaped from myself.

1219
01:29:54,555 --> 01:29:56,887
Not I want to return to where I was.

1220
01:30:07,568 --> 01:30:09,092
He/she looks.

1221
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:12,628
If you are as me and you want to live... 

1222
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:18,274
 ... the only place
in the one that you can be... 

1223
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:20,679
 ... it is right here.

1224
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:23,883
Right now.

1225
01:30:29,757 --> 01:30:31,247
Why did you help me?

1226
01:30:33,494 --> 01:30:35,860
Somebody once made the same thing for me.

1227
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:55,000
