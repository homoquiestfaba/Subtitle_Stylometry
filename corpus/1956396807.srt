you know me rather well.

Mm.

176

The florists are very pleased, and we
need your approval on a centrepiece.

tomorrow at 9:00, though.

I'm sorry to interrupt you,

186
00:11:37,128 --> 00:11:39,048
but Prince Albert of Norway
is in the library.

187
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,728
In our library? Albert, now?

188
00:11:41,888 --> 00:11:43,208
Yes, Your Majesty.

189
00:11:43,368 --> 00:11:47,608
He came unannounced but says he has
urgent business to discuss with you.

190
00:11:47,768 --> 00:11:49,768
His Royal Highness and Edvard
are on their way there.

191
00:11:49,928 --> 00:11:53,488
Thank you, Soren.
I will join them in the library.

192
00:11:55,088 --> 00:11:56,968
Albert and Haarald
went to school together.

193
00:11:57,128 --> 00:11:58,568
He's a friend of yours?

194
00:11:58,728 --> 00:12:01,928
Hardly. Albert's always been
jealous of our family.

195
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:04,768
Then why is he here now?

196
00:12:04,928 --> 00:12:08,568
'Urgent business' usually means
he's here to borrow money.

197
00:12:12,328 --> 00:12:14,248
Albert.
Your Majesty.

198
00:12:14,408 --> 00:12:16,368
Lovely, as always.

199

Haarald.

You remember Edvard, of course.

201
00:12:20,968 --> 00:12:24,328
Of course. I remember when
you were learning to play chess.

202
00:12:24,488 --> 00:12:27,488
How you hated to lose your queen.
And now you're king.

EDVARD: Um…right.

206
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,688
Enough of the small talk. How much
do you need this time, Albert?

207
00:12:39,848 --> 00:12:43,448

Your law is from the Middle Ages.

Edvard, why don't you
join Paige in my quarters,

00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,808
and your father and I will
speak to Albert alone.

Absolutely not.

Listen, in Norway, the tabloids
affectionately refer to Albert

242
00:14:55,048 --> 00:14:58,488
as 'The Royal Pain', and trust me,
the title's well-deserved.

00:20:02,008 --> 00:20:03,768
Yo.

346
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:09,728
Edvard, look, I just want you to know
that I feel so embarrassed

347
00:20:09,888 --> 00:20:11,208
by my father's behaviour.

348
00:20:11,368 --> 00:20:13,568
Ah, well, he's, um…

349
00:20:14,568 --> 00:20:17,688
I mean, your poor fiancêe must think I'm
some evil witch trying to take her place.

350
00:20:17,848 --> 00:20:21,128
No, not at all. Listen, I told her there's
no way you could've been involved in this.

351
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:22,888
So she doesn't hate me?

352
00:20:23,048 --> 00:20:25,688
No! No. No, um…

353
00:20:25,848 --> 00:20:28,528
Do you know, actually, I think
you two would get on very well.

354
00:20:28,688 --> 00:20:30,688
She seems like a great girl.

355
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:32,728
Yes, she is.

356
00:20:32,888 --> 00:20:35,368
She'd have to be, wouldn't she,
to land a guy like you?

357
00:20:35,528 --> 00:20:39,008
Well, that's very kind of you
to say so.

358
00:20:39,168 --> 00:20:41,328
It's been a long time.

359
00:20:41,488 --> 00:20:43,088
Mm. I know.

360
00:20:43,248 --> 00:20:45,928
I was remembering one of the times
I came to spend the summer here.

361
00:20:46,088 --> 00:20:47,528
I think I was about
eight years old.

362
00:20:47,688 --> 00:20:49,248
Oh, God.
So you must've been, what?

363
00:20:49,408 --> 00:20:50,488
Um, I was about…

364
00:20:50,648 --> 00:20:51,728
- 10?
- 10, yes.

365
00:20:51,888 --> 00:20:53,368
I distinctly remember
going up to your bedroom

366
00:20:53,528 --> 00:20:54,808
and asking if you
wanted to play.

367
00:20:54,968 --> 00:20:55,808
(LAUGHS)

368
00:20:55,968 --> 00:20:58,088
And you turned around very
seriously and said to me,

369
00:20:58,248 --> 00:21:01,088
"Kirsten, we're no longer
children, you know.

370
00:21:01,248 --> 00:21:03,728
"You don't ask someone
if they want to play."

371
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,088
BOTH: "You ask them
to do something."

372
00:21:06,248 --> 00:21:08,088
Yes. Oh, God. (LAUGHS)

373
00:21:08,248 --> 00:21:10,968
- You were such an obnoxious brat.
- Thank you.

374
00:21:11,128 --> 00:21:12,448
Oh, but then again,

375
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:15,248
you were the only boy who didn't
make fun of me for being fat,

376
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:16,848
so for that, I'm very grateful.

377
00:21:17,008 --> 00:21:19,448
Well, kids can be cruel.

378
00:21:21,048 --> 00:21:23,448
I mean, let's face it,
you were a bit of a chubster.

379
00:21:23,608 --> 00:21:24,808

381
00:21:27,568 --> 00:21:30,128
Excuse me, but you were not
such a hottie in those days yourself.

382
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:33,528
Anyway, look, I'm here to help.

383
00:21:33,688 --> 00:21:36,008
I hope you know that.

384
00:21:36,168 --> 00:21:38,608
Yes, I do, and I thank you.

385
00:21:38,768 --> 00:21:42,728
Um…it's nice to
see you again, Kirsten.

386
00:21:42,888 --> 00:21:45,928
- And you. Cheers.
- Cheers.

387
00:21:47,568 --> 00:21:51,368
Hey, Mom. It's me.
I guess you're out starting your day.

388
00:21:51,528 --> 00:21:53,168
I'm just about to go to bed,

389
00:21:53,328 --> 00:21:58,328
but I just wanted to call
and tell you that…um…

390
00:21:59,768 --> 00:22:03,248
…everything's great
and I can't wait for you to get here.

391
00:22:03,408 --> 00:22:05,368
Kiss Dad for me.

392
00:22:14,728 --> 00:22:16,968
KIRSTEN: Paige, I'm so glad
you agreed to talk to me.

393
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:19,528
My father's acting like
a complete fool.

394
00:22:19,688 --> 00:22:23,288
I'm so sorry he's causing such drama
just weeks before your wedding.

395
00:22:23,448 --> 00:22:26,248
- Can I ask you something?
- Anything.

396
00:22:26,408 --> 00:22:29,888
Why is your father even doing this
if it isn't something that you want?

397
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,608
Because it's not
about what I want.

398
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:34,528
It's about him wanting to
live vicariously through me.

399
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:36,928
You know, being married to a
king, a title he'll never have …

400
00:22:37,088 --> 00:22:38,408
that kind of stuff.

401
00:22:38,568 --> 00:22:39,408
Right.

402
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:42,208
Actually, my personal theory is
that he's having a midlife crisis.

403
00:22:42,368 --> 00:22:46,088
My own father had one of those at 40.
He got an earring.

404
00:22:46,248 --> 00:22:49,008
- Tragic.
- Mm.

Oh, nothing.

413
00:23:18,088 --> 00:23:20,648
We were just eating,
and I said something about toast

414
00:23:20,808 --> 00:23:23,448
and she thought I said 'toes',
and I guess you had to be there.

415
00:23:23,608 --> 00:23:24,568
Sounds hilarious.

416
00:23:24,728 --> 00:23:27,328
Eddie, it was funny.

417
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,928
You know what? We should go.

418
00:23:29,088 --> 00:23:30,728
Oh, uh, yeah.

419
00:23:30,888 --> 00:23:34,408
Um…I will be back in a little bit.
Are you two going somewhere?

420
00:23:34,568 --> 00:23:38,528
Kirsten's going to show me some of
her favourite sights in Copenhagen.

421
00:23:38,688 --> 00:23:40,248
Oh, you're going shopping.

422
00:23:40,408 --> 00:23:43,168
See you later.

is Kirsten in town for?

430

to stir things up.

- Cool.

the whole culture clash thing.

really cause problems.

don't have anything to worry about.

Don't give up.

so much more than I can speak.

it's what they're teaching you.

Trust me.
I speak seven languages.

for five years.

I know what this is.

Urushiol resin is what
they find in poison ivy

reaction in the skin.

in this room before me.

You know, I knew that
powder was going to work,

but I didn't realise it was
going to work quite so well.

666
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:34,008
I mean,
the Bernini statue into the cake?

667
00:38:34,168 --> 00:38:36,728
Paige, that was priceless.

668
00:38:39,848 --> 00:38:42,688
I can't believe I
actually envied you.

669
00:38:42,848 --> 00:38:45,248
Oh, don't feel bad.
It's only natural that you would.

670
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:49,328
I mean, you're a sweet girl,
Paige, but let's face it,

671
00:38:49,488 --> 00:38:52,448
you're a little out
of your league here.

672
00:38:53,848 --> 00:38:58,168
It's not your fault. You got swept
up in a fairytale. I understand.

673
00:38:58,328 --> 00:39:00,288
You see, the problem is,

674
00:39:00,448 --> 00:39:03,968
Eddie was never meant to marry
someone who was born to milk cows.

675
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:07,248

married in a week.

676
00:39:07,408 --> 00:39:10,048
Don't you know to give up
when the game is already lost?

677
00:39:10,208 --> 00:39:11,848
There is no game, Paige.

678
00:39:12,008 --> 00:39:14,568
There are only royals and norms.

679
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:17,568
And I'm afraid they just
don't go together…

680
00:39:18,728 --> 00:39:22,088
…no matter how hard they might try.

681
00:39:22,248 --> 00:39:26,208
Does Edvard know you feel this way?
He might find it very interesting.

682
00:39:26,368 --> 00:39:29,208
Oh, go ahead.
Tell Edvard anything you like.

683
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:31,528
Please. I dare you.

make more trouble for yourself,

Ah.

691

So, have you two sorted things out?

692
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:02,328
We're fine. It was just
a little misunderstanding.

that everything was OK.

700

So what? Are you afraid
you're going to disappoint him?

701

Afraid? No. I just… I mean,
what difference is it gonna make?

702

It's not gonna change the law.
It's not gonna help find a loophole.

It's only gonna put

I love the name of the ship.

726

Isn't 'clupea' the scientific name
for 'herring'?

727
00:42:16,088 --> 00:42:20,408
Why, yes, it is, Miss Paige.
Most people don't know that.

728
00:42:20,568 --> 00:42:24,048
I was reading the other day
about how Margrethe I of Denmark

729
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,048
had to battle Norway
for Scandinavian supremacy.

730
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:29,768
She ran naval gauntlets
to keep the city supplied with food.

731
00:42:29,928 --> 00:42:32,088
She wouldn't have had to go
to such extremes, of course,

732
00:42:32,248 --> 00:42:34,048
if she'd had the support
of local fishermen.

733
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:36,568
Actually, Kirsten,
I believe you're mistaken.

734
00:42:36,728 --> 00:42:39,088
Margrethe was revered
by the local fishermen.

735
00:42:39,248 --> 00:42:42,048
They felt she was the only one
who could identify with their needs.

736
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:44,088
Or perhaps it was because
she was a true royal

737
00:42:44,248 --> 00:42:46,128
and the commoners knew
she was qualified to lead them.

738
00:42:46,288 --> 00:42:48,128
PAIGE: In any case,
she issued a royal warrant,

739
00:42:48,288 --> 00:42:50,568
giving the Norwegians
one week to vacate Denmark.

740
00:42:50,728 --> 00:42:52,568
Indeed she did. (LAUGHS)

741
00:42:52,728 --> 00:42:56,008
Miss Paige, I must say, I'm impressed
with your breadth of knowledge.

742
00:42:56,168 --> 00:42:58,888
You have truly embraced Denmark
as your country.

00:43:04,728 --> 00:43:07,128

I know how hard
this must be for you.

1026
01:02:39,408 --> 01:02:42,608
I just somehow feel
it's all my fault.

1027
01:02:43,608 --> 01:02:46,168
Yes, well,
blaming yourself won't help.

1028
01:02:46,328 --> 01:02:49,528
I know, and I'm sorry.
I don't mean to make this about me.

1029
01:02:49,688 --> 01:02:51,888

1031

You know, I was thinking that, um…

1032
01:03:11,168 --> 01:03:14,848
…that maybe this was impossible
from the start.

1033
01:03:15,008 --> 01:03:17,928
Well, our world is so very different
from most people's.

1034
01:03:19,768 --> 01:03:22,648
Yeah. Yeah.

1035
01:03:23,648 --> 01:03:26,008
You know, Edvard,
we've known each other all our lives.

1036
01:03:26,168 --> 01:03:28,168
I never would have predicted
we'd be in this situation.

1037
01:03:28,328 --> 01:03:30,728
I honestly thought
my father was crazy.

1038
01:03:31,728 --> 01:03:37,048
But the truth is, the more I'm here,
the more it makes me wonder.

1039
01:03:38,448 --> 01:03:40,528
Wonder what?

1040
01:03:42,608 --> 01:03:44,288
Eddie…

1041
01:03:46,208 --> 01:03:47,768
…maybe no-one's found a loophole

1042
01:03:47,928 --> 01:03:50,928
because a loophole
isn't meant to be found.

1043
01:03:53,288 --> 01:03:56,008
You have to marry
before your 23rd birthday,

1044
01:03:56,168 --> 01:03:58,968
which is only three days
after your wedding day …

1045
01:03:59,128 --> 01:04:01,128
the day that you're bound
by Danish law

1046
01:04:01,288 --> 01:04:04,848
to take a Scandinavian princess
as your bride.

1047
01:04:07,248 --> 01:04:10,168
Maybe that's no coincidence.

1048
01:04:12,888 --> 01:04:15,048
Maybe that's fate…

1049
01:04:16,048 --> 01:04:17,688
…bringing us together.

1050
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:46,128
Good God.

1051
01:04:50,768 --> 01:04:52,528
Miss Paige, this is silly.

1052
01:04:52,688 --> 01:04:55,728
I think you should
come back to the palace.

1053
01:04:55,888 --> 01:04:58,248
- I can't.
- Why not?

1054
01:04:58,408 --> 01:05:00,128
You know
the answer to that, Soren.

1055
01:05:00,288 --> 01:05:02,248
Besides, I'm only here
until exams are over,

1056
01:05:02,408 --> 01:05:06,888
and then, I guess,
back to the States.

1057
01:05:13,008 --> 01:05:14,888
Miss Paige.

1058
01:05:15,048 --> 01:05:18,608
You know, in my youth,
I was a footballer.

1059
01:05:18,768 --> 01:05:20,848
Excuse me, a soccer player.

1060
01:05:21,008 --> 01:05:23,048
In one of the best
junior leagues in Denmark.

1061
01:05:23,208 --> 01:05:27,008
It may be hard to believe looking
at me now, but I was rather good,

1062
01:05:27,168 --> 01:05:30,408
one of the top players
in the country for my age, actually.

1063
01:05:30,568 --> 01:05:33,168
The year I turned 16,

1064
01:05:33,328 --> 01:05:37,608
I played in a championship game
that drew scouts from all over Europe.

1065
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:43,648
Suddenly, there were expectations
and pressures I never knew existed.

1066
01:05:43,808 --> 01:05:47,848
In any event, I spent the whole game
trying to impress the scouts,

1067
01:05:48,008 --> 01:05:51,568
and in doing so,
I ended up trying too hard.

1068
01:05:51,728 --> 01:05:55,008
As a result, I played
the worst game of my life.

1069
01:05:56,128 --> 01:06:01,528
You see, Miss Paige, I had forgotten
why I was there in the first place.

1070
01:06:01,688 --> 01:06:03,168
Why were you there?

1071
01:06:06,448 --> 01:06:08,888
Because I loved the game.

1072
01:06:11,128 --> 01:06:13,168
Always did.

1073
01:06:23,248 --> 01:06:25,408

But we must

1079
01:06:49,368 --> 01:06:50,688
So, what are you saying?

1080
01:06:50,848 --> 01:06:53,448
Are you saying that
I should marry Kirsten?

1081
01:06:55,968 --> 01:06:58,888
I'm saying that sometimes we have
to do what's best for the people,

1082
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:01,448
not what's best for ourselves.

Soren, I've made a decision.

1092
01:08:22,888 --> 01:08:24,848
I don't suppose
it involves slowing down?

Well, speed helps me think.
You know that.
