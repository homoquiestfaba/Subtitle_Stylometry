[gentle music]

15
00:01:34,301 --> 00:01:36,071
I'll make some coffee.

Live in the present.

32
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:11,833
Life is a great adventure.

[car passing]

34
00:03:15,436 --> 00:03:16,905
- Hm.
- What?

35
00:03:17,005 --> 00:03:17,906
Fortune cookie.

36
00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:20,308
Cute.

[muffled shouting on television]

38
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,982
Why are we staying here?

39
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,683
We're living the adventure.

40
00:03:31,452 --> 00:03:35,924
Can this adventure be
a, a little less stained?

41
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:38,860
This is all that was vacant.

42
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,029
I thought you didn't
want it all mapped out.

43
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,664
Yeah, I know.

44
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,668
But at our next stop could we

45
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,637
at least eat at the restaurant?

46
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,673
Are we gonna stay cooped up in

47
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,876
crappy motels rooms all the way there?

48
00:03:56,577 --> 00:03:58,412
That wasn't the point of all this.

49
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:04,319
It's 10 o'clock at
night on our first night.

And look, Game of Thrones is on.

52
00:04:07,756 --> 00:04:09,057
At least we have HBO.

57
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,678
We'll have our adventure, I promise.

60
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,819
Oh, I saw a pamphlet at the check-in Desk.

61
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,421
The world's largest ball of twine,

62
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,689
it's just off the interstate.

63
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:42,757
We could hit it up before lunchtime.

64
00:04:44,525 --> 00:04:46,027
Why do you have to tease?

65
00:04:46,962 --> 00:04:51,399
Relax love, it's just the beginning.

66
00:04:51,498 --> 00:04:55,804
[muffled shouting on television]

67
00:05:01,642 --> 00:05:03,678

- Yeah.

[inhaling]

71
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:25,666
Tell me again when we're
going to do in Denver.

72
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:29,904
You just can't get away from
planning anything, can you?

75
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:32,807
Butt head.

76
00:05:34,575 --> 00:05:37,178
I assume we'd find
a place and settle in.

77
00:05:38,645 --> 00:05:40,148
There's some awesome condos overlooking

78
00:05:40,248 --> 00:05:43,584
the west side of the city,
the foot of the Rockies.

79
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,521
I've never seen the Rockies before.

80
00:05:50,025 --> 00:05:51,026
Let's go up 'em.

81
00:05:51,126 --> 00:05:52,494
[peaceful music]

82
00:05:52,626 --> 00:05:55,697
- Isn't it cold?
- Yeah, it can be.

83
00:05:58,632 --> 00:06:00,268
Cold won't get you.

84
00:06:00,368 --> 00:06:03,204
[peaceful music]

85
00:06:16,317 --> 00:06:17,919
That sky, though?

86
00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:20,587
[Ali] What about it?

87
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:24,225
[peaceful music]

88
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:34,502
[Trent] It's heaven's porch.

89
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:37,872
The colors, the light.

90
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,277
You'd think nothing so
beautiful could be so real.

91
00:06:43,678 --> 00:06:46,081
[Ali] But it is, isn't it?

92
00:06:46,181 --> 00:06:49,017

Trent.

109
00:09:30,378 --> 00:09:31,446
Hey.

110
00:09:31,546 --> 00:09:32,847
I've got a headache.

111
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,349
I'm just looking for the keys.

112
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,084
Is there any Advil in the car?

113
00:09:37,085 --> 00:09:39,821
Yeah, Center console.

114
00:09:41,823 --> 00:09:44,192
Hurry up, come back to bed.

115
00:09:45,526 --> 00:09:47,228
Yeah, yeah, okay.

123
00:10:12,787 --> 00:10:13,888

[fabric rustling]

144
00:12:00,294 --> 00:12:02,163
- Trent.
- Get your things.

145
00:12:07,135 --> 00:12:09,003
It's after three in the morning.

146
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,338
What's going on?

147
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,574
Please stop asking
questions and grab your stuff.

148
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,977
You're skimming with me.

149
00:12:16,077 --> 00:12:19,380
What is it?

150
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,783
Is that a gun?

151
00:12:20,883 --> 00:12:21,750
- Why do you have a gun?
- Yes,

152
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,518
now get the fuck out of bed.

153
00:12:26,187 --> 00:12:28,156
Please do what I say.

154
00:12:29,223 --> 00:12:30,525
Just grab your things.

155
00:12:31,727 --> 00:12:32,627
We're going.

156
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:37,699
[fabric rustling]

157
00:12:43,037 --> 00:12:44,372
You'd better explain
to me what's going on.

158
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,473
We're not safe.

159
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,108
What did you do?

160
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,075
I didn't do anything.

161
00:12:48,176 --> 00:12:51,212
I mean, do you trust me?

162
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,247
I don't know, you have a fucking gun.

163
00:12:53,347 --> 00:12:54,982
If you get your things,

164
00:12:55,082 --> 00:12:57,652
I will tell you everything in the car.

165
00:12:57,753 --> 00:13:00,955
I'm not going anywhere with
you until I get some answers.

166
00:13:01,757 --> 00:13:02,657
Okay.

167
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,660
Maybe I haven't been completely honest.

168
00:13:05,761 --> 00:13:08,062
My line of work isn't really

169
00:13:09,063 --> 00:13:11,199
- legal.
- Drugs?

170
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:12,200
No.

171
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,806
- Did you kill someone?
- Good God, no.

172
00:13:17,906 --> 00:13:18,874
Then what is it?

173
00:13:18,973 --> 00:13:21,142
- I can't tell you exactly.
- Why?

174
00:13:21,242 --> 00:13:23,077
- Why, Trent?
- Because if you knew,

175
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,813
then they would be after you, too.

176
00:13:24,913 --> 00:13:26,715
The less you know, the better.

177
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,519
Too.

178
00:13:31,619 --> 00:13:32,721
Trent, stop hinting around
it, tell me what is...

179
00:13:32,821 --> 00:13:35,256
No, see, if I tell you anything...

180
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,531
This is why we're going
to Denver, isn't it?

181
00:13:44,565 --> 00:13:45,734
Not exactly.

182
00:13:50,973 --> 00:13:52,373
You've been running.

183
00:13:54,008 --> 00:13:55,109
This trip.

184
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,248
How can you be so selfish?

185
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,754
Masking this dream we have

186
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,423
as an alibi for your problem.

187
00:14:09,524 --> 00:14:12,126
I'm sorry things have
gotten complicated,

188
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,962
but my life is messy, Ali.

189
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:18,065
I know you can't understand
that, but this, this trip, this,

190
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:23,070
this trip, it'll change
everything, it'll fix it.

191
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,172
[heavy breathing]

192
00:14:25,273 --> 00:14:29,678
Denver is still our future
and that hasn't ever changed,

193
00:14:29,778 --> 00:14:31,747
not even with what you know now.

194
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,184
I am scared, Alison.

195
00:14:39,053 --> 00:14:40,454
I don't want to lose you

196
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,258
and I don't want to do this without you.

197
00:14:49,664 --> 00:14:52,300
[tense music]

198
00:14:55,202 --> 00:14:56,637
These people,

199
00:14:58,907 --> 00:15:00,207
do they know who I am?

200
00:15:01,043 --> 00:15:03,679
[tense music]

201
00:15:04,813 --> 00:15:06,547
I don't, I don't think so.

202
00:15:06,647 --> 00:15:08,282
You don't think so?

203
00:15:08,382 --> 00:15:09,718
This is our lives, Trent.

204
00:15:09,818 --> 00:15:12,587
Which, that, which is
why we have to go now.

205
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:15,089
It's the only way.

206
00:15:16,058 --> 00:15:17,826
- I'm going ahead of you.
- What?

207
00:15:17,926 --> 00:15:19,393
- Why would you do...
- Trent,

208
00:15:19,493 --> 00:15:24,532
if we are going to get to
Denver, we need to be safe.

209
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,768
This way, it protects both of us.

210
00:15:26,868 --> 00:15:29,270
- I can protect us.
- Can you?

211
00:15:35,877 --> 00:15:36,845
Here.

212
00:15:36,945 --> 00:15:37,879
[gun cocking]

213
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,313
- Take this.
- No, I don't want this.

214
00:15:39,413 --> 00:15:41,515
I've never touched a gun before.

215
00:15:43,618 --> 00:15:47,121
Just please take this, in case.

216
00:15:47,221 --> 00:15:49,357
It would make me feel better.

217
00:15:51,592 --> 00:15:52,928
How are you going to stay protected?

218
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:54,528
I'll be careful.

219
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:57,766
Here, this, this should be enough.

220
00:15:57,866 --> 00:16:01,003
Rent a car, ditch ours,
they'll be looking for it.

221
00:16:01,103 --> 00:16:04,740
Don't talk to anyone and make
as few stops as possible.

222
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,307
Get food and bathroom breaks in

223
00:16:06,407 --> 00:16:08,542
only when you fill up for gas.

224
00:16:09,577 --> 00:16:11,646
How are you going to get there?

225
00:16:11,747 --> 00:16:13,081
Don't worry about me.

226
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,883
I'm good at thinking on my feet.

227
00:16:15,751 --> 00:16:16,918
I will be there.

228
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:19,955
Oh, no cell phones either.

229
00:16:20,055 --> 00:16:21,723
Another way they'll be able to find us.

230
00:16:21,823 --> 00:16:24,026
[crunching]

231
00:16:24,126 --> 00:16:25,626
How do I get ahold of you?

232
00:16:26,728 --> 00:16:27,628
You won't.

233
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:31,198
Just trust.

234
00:16:32,566 --> 00:16:35,070
There's a diner off of Colfax Avenue.

235
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:38,740
I'll be waiting for you
in the booth in the back

236
00:16:39,573 --> 00:16:43,845
at 11:15 am sharp two days from now, okay?

237
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,451
Hey.

238
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,653
Hey hey, that mountaintop.

239
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:57,893
Love, we gotta climb if
we're gonna see that sky.

240
00:16:58,927 --> 00:17:01,697
[hopeful music]

241
00:17:02,363 --> 00:17:03,531
I love you, girly.

242
00:17:06,101 --> 00:17:08,970
I love you, too.

243
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:11,973
[heavy breathing]

244
00:17:13,842 --> 00:17:15,043

[whimpering]

250
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,879
No.

[thudding]

256
00:18:05,026 --> 00:18:07,996
Just you and me, just you and me.

257
00:18:08,096 --> 00:18:08,997
I'm sorry, oh God...

258
00:18:09,097 --> 00:18:11,532
[thudding]

259
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,002
Color looks beautiful on you.

263
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:20,041
Fuck.

264
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:22,677
[grunting]

265
00:18:22,778 --> 00:18:25,213
Henry, you wanna get in on this?

266
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,183
[groaning]

267
00:18:28,282 --> 00:18:29,718
Excuse him.

268
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:30,584
Who needs you?

269
00:18:30,685 --> 00:18:32,921
[thudding]

270
00:18:36,024 --> 00:18:39,326

[thudding]

273
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,816
Now just let it out, yeah.

274
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:01,983
Oh, give me a shower.

275
00:19:03,317 --> 00:19:05,086
Don't spit on me, piece of shit.

276
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:06,554
[thudding]

277
00:19:06,654 --> 00:19:08,622
That's not looking too
good, I'll make it better.

00:19:08,723 --> 00:19:10,859
[thudding]

279
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:11,860
Oh.

280
00:19:14,095 --> 00:19:17,631
You done good, man, you done good.

281
00:19:17,732 --> 00:19:19,134
Woo!

282
00:19:19,234 --> 00:19:20,334
Ah, yeah.

283
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:23,637
[laughing]

284
00:19:23,738 --> 00:19:24,638
Hey oh.

285
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:26,708
You want a cigarette?

286
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,476
Nah, you don't smoke.

287
00:19:31,313 --> 00:19:33,181
[birds tweeting]

288
00:19:33,281 --> 00:19:34,582
What's your deal, man?

289
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:40,956
Think I got a piece of
bone stuck in my knuckle.

290
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:45,961
Got anything I can clean
this shit off with?

291
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:47,295
[keys rattling]

292
00:19:47,428 --> 00:19:49,030
There's a towel in the back.

[car door closing]

295
00:20:01,508 --> 00:20:02,711
Don't get any of it on the car.

296
00:20:02,811 --> 00:20:05,113
Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

297
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:08,616
Why do you always have to
make such a fucking mess?

298
00:20:08,717 --> 00:20:10,318
Because I like to have fun.

299
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,720
You know, if I'm going to fucking work,

300
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,755
I'm gonna have some fun doing it.

301
00:20:14,455 --> 00:20:16,725
A mess just means more work.

302
00:20:18,293 --> 00:20:19,761
You're just fucking nuts.

303
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,131
Yeah.

304
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:25,700
- Yeah, maybe I am.
- Sloppy.

305
00:20:28,303 --> 00:20:29,470
So, what's next?

306
00:20:30,504 --> 00:20:32,107
What do you mean, "What's next?"

307
00:20:32,207 --> 00:20:33,775
Bury the damn body.

308
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,609
Fuck you.

309
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,879
I cooked dinner, you do the dishes.

310
00:20:38,813 --> 00:20:41,582
Why do you always turn
this into a circus act?

311
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:46,553
If they wanted a beating,
they would have asked for one.

312
00:20:46,654 --> 00:20:48,156
They wanted this one dead.

313
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,557
Taking 20 minutes out of our morning

314
00:20:50,658 --> 00:20:52,761
to turn his face into hamburger

315
00:20:52,861 --> 00:20:56,298
doesn't make him any more
dead, it just makes a mess.

316
00:20:57,332 --> 00:20:59,734
You risked breaking your hand
over one lousy little job.

317
00:20:59,834 --> 00:21:02,804
That's what bullets are
for, you fucking moron.

318
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:06,607
Goddamn bull in a China shop.

319
00:21:07,508 --> 00:21:10,011

[chuckling]
[car door closing]

322
00:21:16,251 --> 00:21:17,686
You know, I'm retiring soon.

323
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,089
[Tim] Yeah, you've been
saying that for a while now.

324
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:25,060
No, it's happening.

325
00:21:26,527 --> 00:21:29,931
I'm done, I'm getting off this ride.

326
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:33,134
[bird tweeting]

327
00:21:33,234 --> 00:21:34,668
You think there's some sort of

328
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:36,603
pension check waiting for you?

329
00:21:37,272 --> 00:21:38,373
Sorry to inform you, man,

330
00:21:38,472 --> 00:21:41,076
but there wasn't a 401k
when you signed up.

331
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:42,344
They already know.

332
00:21:42,444 --> 00:21:44,212
What do you mean they already know?

333
00:21:44,312 --> 00:21:45,546
I told them.

334
00:21:46,613 --> 00:21:47,716
I'm moving on.

335
00:21:49,084 --> 00:21:51,585
And just like that, they
said, "Hey, no problem, Henry.

336
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:54,723
"Let us know if you need a
letter of recommendation."

337
00:21:54,823 --> 00:21:56,024
Stop finger fucking me, man.

338
00:21:56,124 --> 00:21:57,624
Just get the lime and the
shovel outta the trunk,

339
00:21:57,726 --> 00:21:59,928
let's bury the body, and go eat.

340
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,162
I'm tired, Tim.

341
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:05,200
I've been around death way too long.

342
00:22:06,835 --> 00:22:08,870
You're a goddamn angel of death.

343
00:22:09,603 --> 00:22:10,739
You were made for this shit.

344
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:13,408
This is who you are, Henry.

345
00:22:13,507 --> 00:22:15,910
Why do you think they've kept you around?

346
00:22:16,011 --> 00:22:17,345
Why do you think they
make sure your tracks

347
00:22:17,445 --> 00:22:18,545
- are covered up?
- My tracks?

348
00:22:18,645 --> 00:22:21,615
No no, those are your tracks

349
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:24,585
and I'm always covering them up.

350
00:22:24,686 --> 00:22:28,456
I'm constantly wiping your ass

351
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,059
and I'm fucking exhausted.

352
00:22:32,494 --> 00:22:34,095
It's time you cleaned up your own shit.

353
00:22:34,195 --> 00:22:35,596
Fuck you.

354
00:22:35,697 --> 00:22:37,098
All right, I make sure the job gets done.

355
00:22:37,198 --> 00:22:40,769
It's not my fault you've grown
some sort of pussy down there

356
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:44,205
and now you want to complain
about being my cleanup bitch.

357
00:22:44,305 --> 00:22:45,840
You've gone soft, you limp dick.

358
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,909
No pussy exit on this ride.

359
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,312
[gun firing]

360
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,848
[thudding]

361
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:00,021
Now get over there
and clean that shit up.

362
00:23:04,993 --> 00:23:07,762
[phone ringing]

363
00:23:11,332 --> 00:23:12,233
Yeah.

364
00:23:13,234 --> 00:23:13,835
Yeah, we're done.

365
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:15,703
I'm just wrapping things up.

366
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:18,706
Okay.

367
00:23:19,573 --> 00:23:21,675
We're still in agreement, right?

368
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:25,180
One more and I'm gone, a clean break.

369
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,749
Two more?

370
00:23:28,649 --> 00:23:30,718
You promise me after this...

371
00:23:32,687 --> 00:23:34,255
Goddamn, you are heavy.

372
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:36,758
Gotta work out, buddy.

373
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:38,359
All right.

374
00:23:41,096 --> 00:23:41,763
Oh yeah.

00:23:44,399 --> 00:23:45,366
Mm, yummy yummy.

377
00:23:49,237 --> 00:23:50,138
Okay.

378
00:23:51,406 --> 00:23:53,908
You want something to drink?

379
00:23:54,675 --> 00:23:58,480
Yeah, probably dehydrated.

Asshole.

384
00:24:14,762 --> 00:24:18,333
All right, two more and I'm gone.

[dirt crunching]

386
00:24:24,606 --> 00:24:25,473
Yup.

387
00:24:25,573 --> 00:24:28,209
All right, dinner's served, bitch.

Shit.

392
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:44,259
Well, anything I do, it doesn't matter.

393
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,659
To them, anyway.

394
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:51,966
As long as they got big boy
Henry swinging his hammer.

395
00:24:52,834 --> 00:24:56,538

That them?

00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:25,900
Yup.

401
00:25:26,634 --> 00:25:28,570
Told 'em we took care of it, yeah?

402
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,771
Yeah.

403
00:25:30,872 --> 00:25:33,741
I'm kind of hungry, you
wanna get some pancakes?

404
00:25:33,841 --> 00:25:35,276
We've got our next job.

405
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:40,014
Some kid, shit head,
running with their stuff.

406
00:25:40,715 --> 00:25:42,550
- Where?
- Out in the Flint Hills,

407
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,118
they think he's headed for Denver.

408
00:25:44,219 --> 00:25:45,119
Shit.

409
00:25:48,223 --> 00:25:50,458
I was really looking
forward to some pancakes.

00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,761
[car door opening]

411
00:25:53,861 --> 00:25:55,196
We have time.

[car door shutting]

415
00:26:02,303 --> 00:26:06,007
I could go for a coffee
and scrambled eggs.

416
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:07,008
Yeah?

417
00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:10,111
Think I saw an IHOP a few miles back.

418
00:26:10,845 --> 00:26:12,914
Let's grab some grub, get a move on.

419
00:26:13,815 --> 00:26:16,351
You know they don't like us to be late.

420

[car engine starting]

421
00:26:17,318 --> 00:26:18,253
No, they don't.

[tense music]

423
00:26:41,442 --> 00:26:43,578
I say we head west
today across the bluffs.

424
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,014
These byways aren't giving us any luck.

425
00:26:46,114 --> 00:26:48,283
We should hit interstate by nightfall.

426
00:26:53,121 --> 00:26:54,022
Ha.

427
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,291
I spoke too soon.

[car approaching]

429
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:03,431
Hey man, need a ride?

430
00:27:03,531 --> 00:27:04,432
Yeah, that'd be great.

431
00:27:04,532 --> 00:27:06,501
My wife and I have been
walking all morning.

432
00:27:09,705 --> 00:27:10,471
[tense music]

433
00:27:10,571 --> 00:27:11,906
Hey buddy, you okay?

00:27:33,294 --> 00:27:34,195
Hey.

440
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,333
What are you doing?

441
00:27:38,433 --> 00:27:39,534
We just missed a ride.

442
00:27:40,736 --> 00:27:43,905
Come on, see if you can
get one all the way across.

443
00:27:45,173 --> 00:27:46,809
We gotta keep moving, love.

444
00:27:46,908 --> 00:27:49,610

[crunching footsteps]

449
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:56,477
Isn't this nice?

450
00:28:59,414 --> 00:29:00,314
Yeah.

451
00:29:04,051 --> 00:29:06,855
I love spending time alone with you.

452
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:09,023
Too bad we can't get enough of it.

453
00:29:10,692 --> 00:29:11,959
I'm just never home.

454
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:13,394
Ever since I married you,

455
00:29:13,494 --> 00:29:17,231
all I ever wanted was
just to make you happy.

456
00:29:18,901 --> 00:29:21,169
It just seems like it never added up.

457
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:27,275
Remember that shit old apartment
we stayed in on Jefferson?

458
00:29:30,211 --> 00:29:31,979
With the spent oil tank.

459
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:34,148
Didn't get above 10
degrees the whole week.

460
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:36,417
And you got up in the middle of the nigh

461
00:29:36,517 --> 00:29:39,086
to go to the closet and
grab another blanket

462
00:29:39,922 --> 00:29:41,322
because you knew, because you knew

463
00:29:41,422 --> 00:29:42,891
if we'd raise that thermostat even

464
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,493
one degree, we wouldn't make rent.

465
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:50,164
And I just laid there,
pretending to be asleep,

466
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:55,236
knowing there was nothing
I could do about it.

467
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:57,972
Do you know how that
makes me feel, Michelle?

468
00:29:59,908 --> 00:30:01,008
As a man?

469
00:30:05,146 --> 00:30:07,716
We started a family.

470
00:30:07,816 --> 00:30:09,818
Did you have to bring that up?

471
00:30:09,918 --> 00:30:11,018
Benjamin.

472
00:30:11,954 --> 00:30:14,655
[gentle music]

473
00:30:17,124 --> 00:30:20,428
We have to get back to the road.

474
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:23,231

00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:28,436

00:30:35,844 --> 00:30:37,078
I'm tired.

478
00:30:42,784 --> 00:30:43,752
Michelle.

479
00:30:48,489 --> 00:30:49,657
I'm not ready.

00:32:37,465 --> 00:32:38,366
Yeah.

504
00:32:40,134 --> 00:32:41,402
Did you do this?

505
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:43,337
You weren't gonna make it.

506
00:32:43,437 --> 00:32:45,907
Poison had gotten pretty
deep into your system.

507
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:48,777
Gave you some antivenom
and got you all cleaned up.

508
00:32:50,277 --> 00:32:51,379
Thanks.

[insects buzzing]

510
00:32:53,447 --> 00:32:55,383
You carry antivenom on you?

511
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,686
Of course.

512
00:32:57,786 --> 00:33:00,354
These hills are infested
with rattlesnakes.

513
00:33:01,489 --> 00:33:02,958
You gotta be more careful.

514
00:33:03,624 --> 00:33:06,128
They'll come out to the
road this time of year.

515
00:33:06,227 --> 00:33:07,561
Take care of yourself.

516
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:14,335
Wait, what, what, are
you, what are, what,

517
00:33:14,435 --> 00:33:16,303
what are you doing out here?

Playing hero.

519
00:33:21,777 --> 00:33:22,944
See any cars lately?

520
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:27,181
We're probably due for one.

521
00:33:27,281 --> 00:33:28,416
You should rest.

522
00:33:29,951 --> 00:33:31,452
I got somewhere to be.

523
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:33,521
Well then don't let me keep you.

Got any water left in there?

Uh, yeah.

You really do need to
be more prepared out here.

535
00:34:27,408 --> 00:34:29,643
Yeah well, I don't do this that often.

What's "this"?

00:34:36,051 --> 00:34:38,552
Um, hitchhiking.

[throat clearing]

544
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:52,167
What are you doing?

545
00:34:52,266 --> 00:34:53,702
Why are you laying there?

546
00:34:54,401 --> 00:34:55,636
I'm hitchhiking.

547
00:34:57,038 --> 00:34:58,073
What if, what if a car comes?

548
00:34:58,173 --> 00:34:59,741
You're not gonna be able to see it.

549
00:34:59,841 --> 00:35:01,176
I'm not going to try and see someone

550
00:35:01,275 --> 00:35:03,410
- that won't try and see me.
- What?

551
00:35:05,247 --> 00:35:07,481
- I'm filtering.
- Filtering.

552
00:35:07,581 --> 00:35:09,483
Yeah, the bullshit.

553
00:35:10,218 --> 00:35:11,686
Saves me the hassle of broadcasting myself

554
00:35:11,787 --> 00:35:13,487
to an audience that won't listen.

555
00:35:13,587 --> 00:35:15,157
What does that even mean?

556
00:35:15,257 --> 00:35:16,158
You're lying in the dirt in the

557
00:35:16,258 --> 00:35:18,292
- middle of nowhere.
- Yeah.

558
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:20,061
Sound familiar?

559
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,536
What's got you in such a hurry, anyway?

560
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,139
[sighing]

561
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:32,207
I'd say by that right hook,

562
00:35:32,306 --> 00:35:34,308
you're trying to get away from someone.

563
00:35:36,812 --> 00:35:39,948
- You don't know me.
- No, I don't.

564
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:44,686
But I do know when I see
someone who's running.

565
00:35:48,422 --> 00:35:49,523
Name's Ben.

566
00:35:53,394 --> 00:35:55,396
Mine's Travis.

567
00:35:58,499 --> 00:36:00,334
- Running thief, huh?
- What?

568
00:36:01,169 --> 00:36:02,270
Well, let's just hope Trent doesn't

569
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:04,840
- find you out here.
- What?

570
00:36:06,007 --> 00:36:06,908
The bag.

571
00:36:10,812 --> 00:36:12,714
You don't have to worry, Trent.

572
00:36:13,447 --> 00:36:15,150
I wouldn't trust some
guy sitting in the dirt

573
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,118
out in the middle of nowhere either.

574
00:36:21,323 --> 00:36:22,423
Besides,

575
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,928
I'd never lose a fair fight.

576
00:36:34,602 --> 00:36:36,503
So how long you been out here?

577
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:39,741
Oh, I don't know.

578
00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:42,010
Couple days?

579
00:36:45,981 --> 00:36:47,182
Weeks?

580
00:36:47,282 --> 00:36:50,151
[insects buzzing]

581
00:36:51,019 --> 00:36:52,553
Oh shit, years?

582
00:36:54,488 --> 00:36:57,092
- Give or take.
- Years.

583
00:36:58,626 --> 00:37:00,394
Did Obama get that second term?

584
00:37:00,494 --> 00:37:02,030
Fuck this.

585
00:37:03,064 --> 00:37:04,900
[crunching footsteps]

586
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,901
Okay.

587
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,869
That was short-lived.

588
00:37:10,537 --> 00:37:11,940
He's definitely running.

589
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:15,377
[insects buzzing]

590
00:37:15,476 --> 00:37:18,813
[crunching footsteps]

591
00:37:19,513 --> 00:37:20,447
Want some?

592
00:37:20,547 --> 00:37:21,983
Do you know where the interstate is?

593
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:26,121
[wheezing laughter]

594
00:37:26,221 --> 00:37:27,122
What's so funny?

595
00:37:28,056 --> 00:37:29,456
What's so fucking funny?

596
00:37:29,556 --> 00:37:31,993
[laughing]

597
00:37:37,699 --> 00:37:41,002
I've never seen someone
run so fast to nowhere.

598
00:37:42,037 --> 00:37:44,239
[laughing]

599
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:45,273
Okay I'm just a little lost

600
00:37:45,373 --> 00:37:46,841
and I needed a little sense direction.

601
00:37:46,942 --> 00:37:48,542
Do you think you can help me
out or are you just going to

602
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:50,779
sit in the dirt another couple years?

603
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:52,914
You know, I make it a point

604
00:37:53,014 --> 00:37:55,482
in my meager existence to say your truth.

605
00:37:56,818 --> 00:37:59,087
I've been alone out here for a while now.

606
00:38:00,789 --> 00:38:03,557
It allows me just to let things pass by.

607
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:05,626
Gives me a chance to soak it all in.

608
00:38:05,727 --> 00:38:08,629
I know when I see
someone who's on the run.

609
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,098
Look, you don't understand...

610
00:38:10,198 --> 00:38:11,700
- Hey hey.
- You don't get...

611
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,768
You know where you're heading out there?

612
00:38:15,737 --> 00:38:18,907
Being lost is a pretty shitty feeling.

613
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,009
I know a lot about that.

614
00:38:22,077 --> 00:38:23,845
So, I offered you the only thing I had.

615
00:38:23,945 --> 00:38:26,881
A little bit of water
and a shit load of time.

616
00:38:28,116 --> 00:38:29,250
I don't have that.

617
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:31,518
You're gonna have to, out here.

618
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:35,223
I mean, that snake bite
almost took you out.

619
00:38:35,323 --> 00:38:36,825
You're not invincible.

620
00:38:40,494 --> 00:38:42,596
[insects buzzing]

621
00:38:42,697 --> 00:38:44,565
[gravel crunching]

622
00:38:44,665 --> 00:38:46,500
Ever have deer jerky before?

623
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,737
No, not much of a hunter.

624
00:38:49,503 --> 00:38:50,872
No, me neither.

625
00:38:50,972 --> 00:38:52,741
I'm not into killing animals.

626
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:56,643
Do you know I picked this shit up

627
00:38:56,745 --> 00:38:58,213
off the side of the
road a couple days back?

628
00:38:58,313 --> 00:38:59,214
Oh fuck.

629
00:38:59,314 --> 00:39:00,782
[laughing]

630
00:39:00,882 --> 00:39:03,550
Fucking [spits] fuck, God.

631
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:06,988
[chuckles] Relax.

632
00:39:08,223 --> 00:39:09,124
It's just jerky.

633
00:39:15,497 --> 00:39:17,832
[sniffing]

634
00:39:17,932 --> 00:39:18,833
Ugh, God.

635
00:39:21,369 --> 00:39:22,837
Where are you headed?

636
00:39:22,937 --> 00:39:25,273
You know, I don't know yet.

637
00:39:26,441 --> 00:39:28,276
- You don't know?
- Yet.

638
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:31,846
So, when will you know?

639
00:39:32,747 --> 00:39:35,316
- Oh, when I hitch a ride.
- No shit.

640
00:39:36,484 --> 00:39:38,253
No, the right ride for me.

641
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:41,723
What, you're trying to tell me you're

642
00:39:41,823 --> 00:39:44,726
some Forrest Gump trek
of life or something?

643
00:39:45,827 --> 00:39:48,029
I didn't exactly pack my magic shoe.

644
00:39:51,632 --> 00:39:52,834
You running, too?

645
00:39:54,235 --> 00:39:55,136
Too?

646
00:40:00,241 --> 00:40:02,010
I'm not running, I'm,

647
00:40:05,646 --> 00:40:06,748
I'm chasing.

648
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:08,716
Oh yeah?

649
00:40:10,552 --> 00:40:13,388
What's that, other than a run?

650
00:40:14,089 --> 00:40:16,057
Okay, this is going to sound dumb.

651
00:40:17,325 --> 00:40:19,227
I'm looking for ever after.

652
00:40:20,661 --> 00:40:22,964
The proverbial happily ever after?

653
00:40:23,064 --> 00:40:26,101
Yeah, it sounds lame when you
say it like that, nevermind.

654
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:30,371
Why do we always have to put our asses

655
00:40:30,472 --> 00:40:32,606
out there for other people's bullshit?

656
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:38,413
I mean, why is it bad
to chase what I want?

657
00:40:38,513 --> 00:40:39,613
Is that wrong?

658
00:40:41,615 --> 00:40:42,717
Fuck em.

659
00:40:43,518 --> 00:40:44,618
Who?

660
00:40:45,587 --> 00:40:46,721
It doesn't matter now.

661
00:40:46,821 --> 00:40:48,756
Hey give, let me have
some more of that jerky.

662
00:40:49,557 --> 00:40:51,459
I didn't know how hungry I was.

663
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:53,995
[rustling]

664
00:40:56,898 --> 00:40:59,100
Life is an interesting game, isn't it?

665
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:01,668
[insects buzzing]

666
00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:03,637
I've crapped out lots of times.

667
00:41:05,773 --> 00:41:07,375
I used to let things get to me.

668
00:41:08,409 --> 00:41:09,911
Now I just let it roll off.

669
00:41:12,413 --> 00:41:14,215
How are you satisfied with that?

670
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,118
It's not about satisfaction.

671
00:41:19,387 --> 00:41:20,822
It's about understanding.

672
00:41:21,923 --> 00:41:23,324
That's bullshit, then.

673
00:41:24,626 --> 00:41:26,361
You're not a fucking tumbleweed.

674
00:41:27,028 --> 00:41:31,166
Isn't there anything
you want more than this?

675
00:41:34,135 --> 00:41:35,036
I don't know.

676
00:41:38,573 --> 00:41:39,673
So,

677
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,810
where you're from?

678
00:41:43,545 --> 00:41:44,913
Kansas City.

679
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:49,717
- Oh yeah, Kansas or Missouri?
- Missouri.

680
00:41:49,817 --> 00:41:51,786
- KCMO.
- Okay.

681
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,389
There's a difference, trust me.

682
00:41:54,489 --> 00:41:56,724
- What's that?
- A shit ton.

683
00:41:57,926 --> 00:41:59,861
The one thing we share is a name.

684
00:42:01,763 --> 00:42:03,264
Fucking hate Kansas.

685
00:42:04,999 --> 00:42:07,135
What about you, where you from?

686
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:09,971
All over.

687
00:42:10,905 --> 00:42:12,207
What does that mean?

688
00:42:13,141 --> 00:42:16,177
I've been traveling so long,
I really don't have a from.

689
00:42:19,847 --> 00:42:21,316
What do you carry in that bag?

690
00:42:23,785 --> 00:42:24,919
Excuse me?

691
00:42:25,019 --> 00:42:26,621
Being here in the middle of nowhere

692
00:42:26,721 --> 00:42:28,022
with nothing to your name but

693
00:42:28,122 --> 00:42:31,292
that beat up old hat, this
crusty jerky, and that bag,

694
00:42:31,392 --> 00:42:34,495
that bag's gotta be the most
valuable thing in your life.

695
00:42:38,166 --> 00:42:39,067
Um.

696
00:42:40,835 --> 00:42:41,936
All right.

698
00:42:52,681 --> 00:42:55,283

- Hello?
- Hey babe, how's it going?

[truck door closing]

703
00:43:10,164 --> 00:43:11,833
- Hey, love.
- How're my ladies doing?

704
00:43:11,933 --> 00:43:13,768
Oh, we're hanging in there.

705
00:43:14,435 --> 00:43:15,003
You're in the nursery,

706
00:43:15,103 --> 00:43:16,771
- aren't you?
- Mm-hm.

707
00:43:16,871 --> 00:43:18,873
Gotten anything new done in there?

708
00:43:18,973 --> 00:43:21,542
Well, the walls are painted purple

709
00:43:21,643 --> 00:43:23,645
because you know I hate pink,

710
00:43:23,746 --> 00:43:26,481
the crib is up, and the mobile is hung.

711
00:43:26,581 --> 00:43:28,449
What about the bookshelf?

712
00:43:28,549 --> 00:43:29,784
It's up, too.

713
00:43:29,884 --> 00:43:30,918
I've been filling it with some

714
00:43:31,019 --> 00:43:33,154
books I found in my mom's attic.

715
00:43:38,694 --> 00:43:39,527
On one of my runs, I stopped at

716
00:43:39,627 --> 00:43:41,262
a flea market down in Phoenix.

717
00:43:42,363 --> 00:43:45,300
There's this older woman there
who made these worry dolls.

718
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,802
She said you were supposed
to share all your worries

719
00:43:47,902 --> 00:43:50,706
to the doll and it'll
take them away from you.

720
00:43:50,805 --> 00:43:52,540
You are always buying stuff.

721
00:43:53,207 --> 00:43:54,242
I don't think this nursery

722
00:43:54,342 --> 00:43:56,177
can hold everything you bring home.

723
00:43:56,277 --> 00:43:59,580
I made that one, the
woman taught me how.

724
00:43:59,682 --> 00:44:03,251
It's beautiful, I love it.

725
00:44:03,351 --> 00:44:04,787
Well, I gotta run.

726
00:44:04,886 --> 00:44:06,954
I'm gonna grab a hot shower.

727
00:44:07,055 --> 00:44:08,489
I'll see you on Thursday.

728
00:44:09,924 --> 00:44:12,126
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

Why are you carrying rocks in your bag

737
00:44:41,389 --> 00:44:43,358
I don't need to explain
shit to you, all right?

738
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:46,829
- How dare you invade my life?
- Invade your life?

739
00:44:46,928 --> 00:44:48,229
What's wrong with you?

740
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:50,631
Don't expect people to pour
their hearts out to you

741
00:44:50,733 --> 00:44:52,701
so you can guide them through life,

742
00:44:52,801 --> 00:44:54,102
give them a piece of your wisdom,

743
00:44:54,202 --> 00:44:55,903
and then bitch our when they
put it into the spotlight.

744
00:44:56,003 --> 00:44:56,904
Excuse me?

745
00:44:57,538 --> 00:44:59,907
- You don't know shit.
- It's all over your face.

746
00:45:00,007 --> 00:45:01,509
Who saved your sorry ass?

747
00:45:02,176 --> 00:45:03,611
You think you know something?

748
00:45:03,712 --> 00:45:04,747
You think you know somebody?

749
00:45:04,847 --> 00:45:06,981
I've got years on you, you piss ant.

750
00:45:07,081 --> 00:45:09,484
You've got a lot to learn
about life and people.

751
00:45:09,584 --> 00:45:12,821
- Yeah, more like you forgot.
- Stay away from me, Trent.

752
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,555
Forget we ever crossed paths.

753
00:45:16,424 --> 00:45:17,826
- What are you doing?
- It doesn't matter,

754
00:45:17,925 --> 00:45:19,695
you can be somebody else's problem.

755
00:45:19,795 --> 00:45:21,697
No, I didn't mean it that way.

756
00:45:21,797 --> 00:45:23,264
No, you're hurt, Ben.

757
00:45:24,132 --> 00:45:26,534
- It's obvious.
- Hey, stop, all right?

758
00:45:26,634 --> 00:45:27,935
You're right, all right?

759
00:45:28,035 --> 00:45:29,036
I buddied up to you trying to solve

760
00:45:29,137 --> 00:45:31,472
your problems like some roadside Dr. Phil.

761
00:45:31,572 --> 00:45:34,575
You found the bullshit card,
so just move on, Trent.

762
00:45:34,675 --> 00:45:36,911
I'm sorry, all right, I'm sorry.

763
00:45:39,882 --> 00:45:40,982
So that's it.

764
00:45:42,483 --> 00:45:44,152
This is bullshit.

765
00:45:45,353 --> 00:45:47,588
- Who's running now?
- C'mon.

00:45:47,689 --> 00:45:50,324
[backpack thudding]

767
00:45:50,425 --> 00:45:51,926
What the fuck do you want from me,

768
00:45:52,026 --> 00:45:53,027
- huh?
- I don't know.

769
00:45:53,127 --> 00:45:54,462
That I'm some piece of shit truck driver

770
00:45:54,562 --> 00:45:57,365
that was always working,
always on the road?

771
00:45:58,199 --> 00:46:01,269
I drove as fast as I could,
but I honestly thought

772
00:46:01,369 --> 00:46:03,538
everyone was freaking out over nothing.

773
00:46:05,606 --> 00:46:06,474
I,

774
00:46:16,184 --> 00:46:18,352
I didn't see the signs.

776
00:46:23,491 --> 00:46:25,092
I was ignorant

777
00:46:27,228 --> 00:46:28,463
and a fucking idiot.

778
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,970

780
00:46:40,141 --> 00:46:41,642
I took them for granted.

781
00:46:43,244 --> 00:46:45,346
- I didn't realize.
- Ben.

782
00:46:46,915 --> 00:46:48,983
She was the only one

783
00:46:50,651 --> 00:46:51,552
who loved me.

784
00:46:54,322 --> 00:46:59,360
Even when I wasn't there
for her, she still loved me.

785
00:47:02,997 --> 00:47:05,066
I knew what they were all saying.

786
00:47:07,903 --> 00:47:10,471
I knew what they all thought.

787
00:47:11,172 --> 00:47:12,774
But I didn't give a shit.

788

[dramatic music]

789
00:47:16,344 --> 00:47:20,147
But she knew, she knew the truth.

[sniffing]

791
00:47:26,254 --> 00:47:31,325
I was her strength, dammit,
and I fucking lost her.

792
00:47:32,995 --> 00:47:34,763
I lost both of them.

793
00:47:35,663 --> 00:47:37,231
I lost both of em

794
00:47:39,768 --> 00:47:42,537
[sobs] to this.

795
00:47:43,906 --> 00:47:44,806

So I walk.

800
00:48:09,932 --> 00:48:12,366
Lost.

801
00:48:12,466 --> 00:48:15,503
Because I lost everything to this road.

802
00:48:20,174 --> 00:48:21,542
I ain't running, man.

803
00:48:23,946 --> 00:48:27,248

What's your fucking deal, man?

808
00:48:49,071 --> 00:48:50,839
You haven't said shit to me
since breakfast and you just

809
00:48:50,939 --> 00:48:53,909
sat there staring at your
phone the whole fucking time.

810
00:48:54,009 --> 00:48:54,876
What's going on?

811
00:48:58,646 --> 00:49:01,616
We are all formed of frailty and error.

812
00:49:03,184 --> 00:49:05,286
That is the first law of nature.

813
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,589
What the fuck are you talking about?

814
00:49:10,726 --> 00:49:12,526
Voltaire, an asshole.

815
00:49:12,627 --> 00:49:15,396
Is that some sort of
men's cologne or something?

816
00:49:16,397 --> 00:49:17,933
Look, instead of being
all cryptic and shit,

817
00:49:18,033 --> 00:49:19,034
if you've got something to say,

818
00:49:19,133 --> 00:49:20,401
just say it to my fucking face, all right?

819
00:49:20,501 --> 00:49:22,403
You don't have a problem
whizzing bullets past my head.

820
00:49:22,503 --> 00:49:26,708
I want 30 on pump one and
I want some sunflower seeds

821

- Okay.

822
00:49:30,277 --> 00:49:32,346

Oh, you're welcome.

You know, you're lucky I
was headed out this way.

880
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:22,110
I got a bull that got outta
pasture about 10 miles west here

881

So what's going to happen?

920
00:55:30,071 --> 00:55:32,506
Kill me, of course.

921
00:55:36,677 --> 00:55:38,512
Can't let that happen, though.

922
00:55:40,181 --> 00:55:41,249
She's waiting for me.

923
00:55:43,451 --> 00:55:44,551
Who?

924
00:55:47,554 --> 00:55:49,991
[rustling]

925
00:55:53,627 --> 00:55:56,663
[paper rustling]

926
00:55:59,367 --> 00:56:00,268
Whoa.

927
00:56:02,504 --> 00:56:03,872
She's beautiful.

928
00:56:05,974 --> 00:56:06,875
Alison.

929
00:56:10,245 --> 00:56:11,312
How'd you meet her?

930
00:56:12,747 --> 00:56:14,349
[breathy laughing]

931
00:56:14,449 --> 00:56:17,085
You know how they say love finds you?

932
00:56:19,653 --> 00:56:21,555
- Yeah.
- It found me.

933
00:56:23,925 --> 00:56:25,626
You'll never believe where.

934
00:56:27,195 --> 00:56:30,231
[car engine idling]

935
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:35,569
- So you fall?
- No.

936
00:56:35,669 --> 00:56:37,472
Yeah, kind of.

937
00:56:37,571 --> 00:56:39,640
You never heard of indoor skydiving?

938
00:56:40,275 --> 00:56:41,176
Not really.

939
00:56:43,577 --> 00:56:44,779
Whatever.

940
00:56:44,879 --> 00:56:47,949
These jobs keep getting
weirder and weirder.

941
00:56:48,049 --> 00:56:49,217
Come on.

942
00:56:49,317 --> 00:56:52,020
[car doors opening]

943
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:55,622
[car doors closing]

944
00:56:55,723 --> 00:56:58,827
[traffic passing]

945
00:57:07,601 --> 00:57:10,371
[muffled music]

946
00:57:23,384 --> 00:57:24,686
Drop's over there.

947
00:57:31,793 --> 00:57:34,162
C'mon Robbie, you can
be smarter than that.

948
00:57:34,929 --> 00:57:37,899
Let's get our suits and stick to the plan.

949
00:57:42,203 --> 00:57:43,204
- Hello.
- Hi.

950
00:57:43,304 --> 00:57:45,874
Hi guys, okay, so you're
going to need a suit.

951
00:57:45,974 --> 00:57:47,208
- Oh.
- This one's mine?

952
00:57:47,308 --> 00:57:48,076
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

953
00:57:48,176 --> 00:57:50,512
- Okay.
- This is way too much cool.

954
00:57:50,612 --> 00:57:51,880
[laughing]

955
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:54,249
- Thank you.
- Yeah, thank you.

956
00:57:58,853 --> 00:58:01,089
[door opening]

957
00:58:01,189 --> 00:58:04,058
[fabric rustling]

958
00:58:15,937 --> 00:58:18,006
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

959
00:58:18,106 --> 00:58:19,707
Let's just get this shit done.

960
00:58:19,807 --> 00:58:20,975
What's going on?

961
00:58:21,709 --> 00:58:23,077
[sighs] You're not going to like it.

962
00:58:23,178 --> 00:58:25,046
Robbie, half the shit
you say I don't like.

963
00:58:25,146 --> 00:58:28,082
- Just tell me.
- Hear about Darrel and Jason?

964
00:58:28,183 --> 00:58:29,117
What about em?

965
00:58:29,217 --> 00:58:30,218
They were supposed to
be on a high dollar drop

966
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:31,719
- last week.
- So what?

967
00:58:31,819 --> 00:58:34,022
They asked me to go with Jason instead.

968
00:58:35,423 --> 00:58:37,292
- Wait, what?
- Yeah, I know.

969
00:58:38,426 --> 00:58:39,861
But I think Darrel fucked up.

970
00:58:39,961 --> 00:58:41,896
I heard he wanted to know if
the that was inside the bag

971
00:58:41,996 --> 00:58:44,098
was worth more than the
money they were paying him.

972
00:58:44,199 --> 00:58:46,501
So they're switching up co-ops now?

973
00:58:46,601 --> 00:58:48,069
I started asking around.

974
00:58:48,937 --> 00:58:52,006
His crew, his family,
nobody's heard from him.

975
00:58:53,741 --> 00:58:54,976
Trent, that's what they
do with people like us,

976
00:58:55,076 --> 00:58:56,844
you know, if we don't stick to the plan.

977
00:58:56,945 --> 00:58:58,947
Apparently I'm not
part of this new plan.

978
00:58:59,047 --> 00:59:02,984
Trent, I'm worried things are changing.

979
00:59:05,386 --> 00:59:06,454
Get this shit done.

980
00:59:07,488 --> 00:59:09,490
We'll talk more about this later.

981
00:59:09,591 --> 00:59:11,392
[door slamming]

982
00:59:11,492 --> 00:59:14,329
[tense music]

983
00:59:14,429 --> 00:59:16,798
[sighing]

984
00:59:23,671 --> 00:59:26,441
[muffled music]

985
00:59:34,148 --> 00:59:38,119
- You ever do this before?
- No, first time.

986
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,456
You're gonna love it,
there's nothing like it.

987
00:59:42,257 --> 00:59:43,692
It's not every day
you get a chance to fly,

988
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:45,960
- right?
- Exactly.

989
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:49,063
- I'm here once a week.
- Once a week?

990
00:59:49,163 --> 00:59:50,131
Yeah.

991
00:59:50,231 --> 00:59:51,734
If you had the opportunity to fly,

992
00:59:51,866 --> 00:59:54,335
wouldn't you do it as much as you could?

993
00:59:54,435 --> 00:59:55,738
- She's weird.
- Yeah,

994
00:59:55,837 --> 00:59:56,971
we tried to get her to go shopping

995
00:59:57,071 --> 00:59:58,840
or to the movies with us, but she'd rather

996
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:01,009
be here with her head in the clouds.

997
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:04,012
It's a different way to spend your time.

998
01:00:09,017 --> 01:00:12,320
You ever have a flying dream before?

999
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:13,454
Not in a while.

1000
01:00:15,156 --> 01:00:16,824
This is what it feels like.

1001
01:00:26,467 --> 01:00:29,370
[throat clearing]

1002
01:00:30,938 --> 01:00:32,006
Sup guys, y'all ready to fly?

1003
01:00:32,106 --> 01:00:33,941
- Yeah.
- Cool, all right,

1004
01:00:34,042 --> 01:00:36,077
well let's go ahead and
get all of our gear on.

1005
01:00:36,177 --> 01:00:38,813
That way we'll have
everything ready to go.

1006
01:00:38,913 --> 01:00:40,014
Ali, you don't need to hear this again,

1007
01:00:40,114 --> 01:00:42,150
but for everybody else,
just remember relax,

1008
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:43,484
all right, hold nice and still,

1009
01:00:43,584 --> 01:00:45,620
and just try to keep your
chin up the entire time.

1010
01:00:45,721 --> 01:00:47,088
- Okay.
- All right,

1011
01:00:47,188 --> 01:00:48,856
so Ali, I know you probably
wanted to hop in solo this time,

1012
01:00:48,956 --> 01:00:50,793
but we're kind of backed
up and really busy.

1013
01:00:50,892 --> 01:00:51,893
Do you mind pairing up with somebody?

1014
01:00:51,993 --> 01:00:53,961
- Yeah, sure.
- Cool.

1015
01:00:54,062 --> 01:00:56,597
How about you go with your friend here?

1016
01:00:56,699 --> 01:00:58,599
Sound good, friend?

1017
01:00:58,701 --> 01:01:00,868
Who am I supposed to go with?

1018
01:01:00,968 --> 01:01:02,771
Do you mind going with my friend here?

1019
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:04,038
Yeah, that's fine.

1020
01:01:04,138 --> 01:01:05,873
I'll go with you and then
Ali, you can go with...

1021
01:01:05,973 --> 01:01:08,609
- Trent.
- Cool, all right.

1022
01:01:08,711 --> 01:01:09,745
Ali, Trent, are you guys ready to fly?

1023
01:01:09,844 --> 01:01:10,746
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1024
01:01:10,845 --> 01:01:11,646
Sweet, well let's hope in and fly.

1025
01:01:11,747 --> 01:01:13,915
- All right.
- All right.

1026
01:01:14,649 --> 01:01:17,418
Hey, don't get too distracted.

1027
01:01:18,986 --> 01:01:20,555
[door opening]

1028
01:01:20,655 --> 01:01:22,924
[gentle music]

1029
01:01:23,024 --> 01:01:23,792
All right I'll turn up

1030
01:01:23,891 --> 01:01:24,992
- your time.
- Okay.

1031
01:01:28,996 --> 01:01:30,298
- Nervous?
- No.

1032
01:01:31,734 --> 01:01:34,035
- A little?
- Don't be.

1033
01:01:34,969 --> 01:01:36,170
Here, hold my hands.

1034
01:01:37,538 --> 01:01:41,642
When they start it up, don't
fight it, let it take you up.

1035
01:01:43,044 --> 01:01:45,046
- Then what?
- Go with it.

1036
01:01:47,482 --> 01:01:49,283
I'll hold onto you.

1037
01:01:49,384 --> 01:01:52,086
[gentle music]

1038
01:02:01,864 --> 01:02:04,499
[air hissing]

1039
01:02:08,936 --> 01:02:11,639
[gentle music]

1040
01:03:12,433 --> 01:03:13,468
[laughing]

1041
01:03:13,568 --> 01:03:14,535
- So?
- All right.

1042
01:03:14,635 --> 01:03:16,037
- What'd you think?
- All right, all right,

1043
01:03:16,137 --> 01:03:18,239
- it was cool.
- [laughs] Right?

1044
01:03:18,339 --> 01:03:19,340
[chuckles] Thanks for making me

1045
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,676
not look like too much of a fool in there.

1046
01:03:21,777 --> 01:03:24,045
[chuckles] It was fun.

1047
01:03:29,417 --> 01:03:33,421
Looks like your friend
is handling it well.

1048
01:03:36,859 --> 01:03:39,293
[laughing]

1049
01:03:40,729 --> 01:03:41,629
Oh god.

1050
01:03:43,264 --> 01:03:45,500
So you really come here once a week?

1051
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,369
Yeah, I've been coming
for about a month now.

1052
01:03:48,469 --> 01:03:50,438
It's crazy, I know, but it just

1053
01:03:50,538 --> 01:03:52,640
seems to be the best way to get a break.

1054
01:03:53,909 --> 01:03:55,109
You don't need to know about that.

1055
01:03:55,209 --> 01:03:56,712
A break from what?

1056
01:03:59,748 --> 01:04:00,648
People.

1057
01:04:01,884 --> 01:04:04,552
Ah, like a boyfriend.

1058
01:04:04,652 --> 01:04:05,721
No boyfriend.

1059
01:04:06,755 --> 01:04:07,756
My parents.

1060
01:04:07,856 --> 01:04:10,124
They're always poking
their head into something.

1061
01:04:10,224 --> 01:04:11,325
It can be a little much.

1062
01:04:11,425 --> 01:04:13,661
I actually have no
idea what that's like.

1063
01:04:13,762 --> 01:04:14,696
It's exhausting.

1064
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:18,132
They mean well but they have
everything mapped out for me.

1065
01:04:18,232 --> 01:04:19,667
That I know about.

1066
01:04:20,668 --> 01:04:23,839
It sucks when other people
are calling the shots.

1067
01:04:23,939 --> 01:04:25,172
It is exhausting.

1068
01:04:26,808 --> 01:04:29,745
Even more so, you just feel robbed.

1069
01:04:32,948 --> 01:04:33,916
- Hey.
- Hm?

1070
01:04:34,016 --> 01:04:35,516
Did you forget something?

1071
01:04:37,218 --> 01:04:38,553
- Thanks.
- Uh huh.

1072
01:04:40,789 --> 01:04:41,790
What'd you think?

1073
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:42,791
You like it?

1074
01:04:42,891 --> 01:04:46,093
Eh, it's not really my cup of tea.

1075
01:04:46,193 --> 01:04:47,029
Next time.

1076
01:04:47,128 --> 01:04:48,563
It gets better with practice.

1077
01:04:48,663 --> 01:04:50,131
Oh, yeah.

1078
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:53,501
We can't be late.

1079
01:04:56,137 --> 01:04:57,471
Sorry, I,

1080
01:04:58,707 --> 01:05:00,174
I gotta get going.

1081
01:05:00,274 --> 01:05:01,810
It's okay, I better
get back to my friends

1082
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:03,344
- anyway.
- Yeah.

1083
01:05:06,647 --> 01:05:09,183
Can I see you again?

1084
01:05:11,787 --> 01:05:13,154
You know where to find me.

1085
01:05:16,925 --> 01:05:17,826
Yeah.

1086
01:05:19,995 --> 01:05:20,996
[smacking]

1087
01:05:21,095 --> 01:05:22,196
[laughing]

1088
01:05:22,296 --> 01:05:24,432
Was she there next Sunday?

1089
01:05:24,532 --> 01:05:25,466
Yeah.

1090
01:05:25,566 --> 01:05:27,168
Yeah, we met up there every Sunday

1091
01:05:27,268 --> 01:05:28,804
for the rest of the summer.

1092
01:05:31,272 --> 01:05:33,041
Indoor skydiving?

1093
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:35,744
Yeah, indoor skydiving.

1094
01:05:35,844 --> 01:05:37,578
[laughing]

1095
01:05:37,678 --> 01:05:42,483
You know how you look at a
woman that you're attracted to

1096
01:05:43,317 --> 01:05:46,621
and then she gives you a look
back and then looks away,

1097
01:05:47,388 --> 01:05:49,758
you know, waiting for the chase?

1098
01:05:49,858 --> 01:05:50,859
Yeah.

1099
01:05:50,959 --> 01:05:53,127
[insects buzzing]

1100
01:05:53,227 --> 01:05:54,595
She never looked away.

1101
01:05:56,965 --> 01:05:58,399
Her eyes never left mine.

1102
01:06:00,201 --> 01:06:01,770
She didn't want the chase.

1103
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:04,773
[insects buzzing]

1104
01:06:06,074 --> 01:06:07,743
So where is she waiting for you?

1105
01:06:07,843 --> 01:06:08,744
Denver.

1106
01:06:10,478 --> 01:06:12,714
We gotta be there by tomorrow.

1107
01:06:12,814 --> 01:06:13,715
Denver?

1108
01:06:14,816 --> 01:06:16,084
Tomorrow?

1109
01:06:16,183 --> 01:06:17,085
You do know that's more than

1110
01:06:17,184 --> 01:06:18,887
- 500 miles west?
- I know.

1111
01:06:20,154 --> 01:06:21,255
We'll make it.

1112
01:06:22,490 --> 01:06:25,093
There's not a lot of traffic out here.

1113
01:06:25,192 --> 01:06:26,627
The nearest city is 30 plus miles...

1114
01:06:26,728 --> 01:06:29,597
Just because you didn't
make it doesn't mean I won't.

1115
01:06:32,868 --> 01:06:35,236
[sighs] I'm sorry.

1116
01:06:35,336 --> 01:06:37,271
I didn't mean to say it like that.

1117
01:06:37,371 --> 01:06:38,472
No, it's okay.

1118
01:06:39,808 --> 01:06:40,709
You're right.

1119
01:06:42,044 --> 01:06:43,177
I don't, I don't care who's right.

1120
01:06:43,277 --> 01:06:45,279
I just want to get there.

1121
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,050
Don't you think they'll expect you

1122
01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:50,551
- heading west?
- Maybe.

1123
01:06:50,651 --> 01:06:53,554
Which is why I got to stay a step ahead.

1124
01:06:53,654 --> 01:06:54,990
That's what brought me out here.

1125
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:59,627
I thought going through this,
this would keep me hidden.

1126
01:06:59,728 --> 01:07:02,463
You know, if I'm in nowhere,
how can they get me?

1127
01:07:03,264 --> 01:07:06,902
Yeah, but 500 miles in one day on foot?

1128
01:07:08,402 --> 01:07:09,603
I don't know, Trent.

1129
01:07:10,872 --> 01:07:13,842
[insects chirping]

1130
01:07:17,112 --> 01:07:18,212
How about you?

1131
01:07:19,948 --> 01:07:20,849
Ben?

1132
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:23,685
Me?

1133
01:07:23,785 --> 01:07:25,087
Yeah.

1134
01:07:25,187 --> 01:07:26,420
Ben, you.

1135
01:07:27,621 --> 01:07:28,522
Help me.

1136
01:07:29,157 --> 01:07:30,624
Help me get out of this.

1137
01:07:30,726 --> 01:07:31,625
I mean,

1138
01:07:32,259 --> 01:07:34,562
I mean, shit, all this time.

1139
01:07:36,131 --> 01:07:37,431
[laughing]

1140
01:07:37,531 --> 01:07:41,268
You've been here, no, how
long have you been out here?

1141
01:07:41,368 --> 01:07:43,171
Years, right?

1142
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:44,873
Just out here in these hills.

1143
01:07:47,675 --> 01:07:50,511
- I got my own...
- No, no, you'd be perfect.

1144
01:07:50,611 --> 01:07:52,279
No, you know these hills,
you know these hills

1145
01:07:52,379 --> 01:07:54,348
like they were your own home.

1146
01:07:54,448 --> 01:07:56,517
Come with me, Ben.

1147
01:07:56,617 --> 01:07:59,154
You know all the shortcuts and the byways.

1148
01:07:59,253 --> 01:08:00,222
You'd be the perfect person

1149
01:08:00,321 --> 01:08:02,958
to get me out west under the radar.

1150
01:08:03,992 --> 01:08:05,292
Can't you tell her
you're running behind?

1151
01:08:05,392 --> 01:08:08,063
No, no, there's no
contacting each other.

1152
01:08:08,163 --> 01:08:09,698
I don't have a phone.

1153
01:08:09,798 --> 01:08:10,732
Cause then that way
they'd be able to find us.

1154
01:08:10,832 --> 01:08:13,501
All we have is a location and a time.

1155
01:08:14,836 --> 01:08:16,403
Ben, please.

1156
01:08:16,504 --> 01:08:18,372
They won't just kill me.

1157
01:08:21,009 --> 01:08:22,110
I can't be a part of any more...

1158
01:08:22,210 --> 01:08:24,012
- Fuck.
- I just can't.

1159
01:08:26,815 --> 01:08:29,718
[heavy breathing]

1160
01:08:36,691 --> 01:08:37,591
All right.

1161
01:08:40,394 --> 01:08:42,998
I know this back road,
five miles east of here.

1162
01:08:43,865 --> 01:08:45,033
That's the wrong way.

1163
01:08:46,768 --> 01:08:47,601
There'll be a truck stop there

1164
01:08:47,702 --> 01:08:49,503
where a lot of I70 truckers stop.

1165
01:08:50,172 --> 01:08:51,940
There'll be a lot of Colorado plates.

1166
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,943
You're bound to catch a ride there.

1167
01:08:55,043 --> 01:08:58,213
[insects buzzing]

1168
01:08:58,312 --> 01:08:59,413
You sure?

1169
01:09:00,648 --> 01:09:03,084
Yeah, it was my route.

1170
01:09:06,054 --> 01:09:06,955
I guess.

1171
01:09:09,423 --> 01:09:12,060
I've been trying to find
a faster way out of here,

1172
01:09:13,261 --> 01:09:14,361
a better way,

1173
01:09:17,498 --> 01:09:18,666
since I lost them.

[insects chirping]

1175
01:09:22,771 --> 01:09:23,671
Trust me.

1176
01:09:27,242 --> 01:09:29,077
Okay.

1177
01:09:29,177 --> 01:09:31,880

- Thanks.
- No problem.

1187
01:10:19,027 --> 01:10:20,161
Where you headed?

1188
01:10:20,262 --> 01:10:22,898
Oh, there's a truck stop
about five miles east of here.

1189
01:10:23,865 --> 01:10:25,700
Yeah, we know where that is.

1190

1191
01:10:29,470 --> 01:10:31,273
Oh, I don't have a car.

1192
01:10:31,373 --> 01:10:35,143
So what are you doing out
here in the middle of nowhere?

1193
01:10:35,243 --> 01:10:36,677
Uh, just traveling.

1194
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:41,448
Traveling? On foot?

1195
01:10:42,684 --> 01:10:44,819
What, are you on some kind
of crusade or something?

1196

Not really heading anywhere.

1200
01:10:55,462 --> 01:10:56,597
How do you mean?

1201
01:10:57,665 --> 01:11:01,568
It's uh, It's not so much a where.

1202
01:11:02,603 --> 01:11:03,705
But a who.

1203
01:11:07,608 --> 01:11:11,313
- Who are you looking for?
- A friend of ours.

1204
01:11:11,413 --> 01:11:12,747
Got lost out here.

1205
01:11:14,716 --> 01:11:16,550
The Flint Hills, they're like,

1206
01:11:17,584 --> 01:11:20,121
like the Bermuda Triangle of the Midwest

1208
01:11:22,324 --> 01:11:24,726
You know, people, they, they get in he

1209
01:11:24,826 --> 01:11:26,795
and then they just disappear.

1210
01:11:28,296 --> 01:11:29,831
It's kind of freaky, really.

1211
01:11:31,399 --> 01:11:33,868
- What do you think, Henry?
- Shit, yeah.

1212
01:11:35,837 --> 01:11:38,605
It's, it's open, desolate.

1213
01:11:39,874 --> 01:11:42,811
Real easy for somebody to lose their way

01:11:46,948 --> 01:11:49,583

- What's wrong?

I just gotta piss.

1217
01:11:53,054 --> 01:11:53,989
Can you hold it?

1218
01:11:55,790 --> 01:11:56,623
We're almost there.

1219
01:11:56,725 --> 01:11:58,927
Yeah, no, I really gotta go.

1220
01:11:59,961 --> 01:12:02,030
If you could just pull
out right over here.

1221
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:03,031
I'll be quick.

1222
01:12:05,532 --> 01:12:06,533
All right, Henry.

1223
01:12:06,633 --> 01:12:08,737
I guess when you gotta go, you gotta go.

1224
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:11,439
I guess so.

No, don't worry.

1231
01:12:31,159 --> 01:12:33,361
What's the matter, you got a small dick?

1232
01:12:33,461 --> 01:12:34,996
I mean it's okay if you got a tiny pecker,

1233
01:12:35,096 --> 01:12:36,563
we won't laugh too hard.

1234
01:12:37,365 --> 01:12:39,566
Hey, where do you think you're going?

[gun firing]

1236
01:12:41,903 --> 01:12:44,272

No no no no, don't shoot
her, don't, don't shoot her.

1241
01:12:55,984 --> 01:12:56,885
Yeah.

[whimpering]

1243
01:12:58,987 --> 01:13:00,088
Does she think you have a little dick?

1244
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:02,991
Do you?

1245
01:13:03,091 --> 01:13:04,558
[wailing]

1246
01:13:04,658 --> 01:13:06,694
Does he got a little midget dick?

1247
01:13:06,795 --> 01:13:09,596
No no no, don't, don't,
don't, don't hurt her, please.

1248
01:13:10,899 --> 01:13:12,599
That's pretty fucked up.

1249
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:15,703
This midget dick motherfucker
got you into shit.

1250
01:13:15,804 --> 01:13:17,939
Gonna get you killed and couldn't
even probably get you off.

1251
01:13:18,039 --> 01:13:19,307
Please don't, don't hurt her.

1252
01:13:19,407 --> 01:13:21,642
Did you really think he
couldn't be found, Trent?

1253
01:13:21,743 --> 01:13:23,178
Look, I know who you are.

1254
01:13:23,278 --> 01:13:24,611
I know they sent you.

1255
01:13:24,712 --> 01:13:26,047
I'm not trying to hurt anybody.

1256
01:13:26,147 --> 01:13:28,649
I'm just trying to get out of this shit.

Fuck, no, fuck, stop.

Just stop, please stop.

1260
01:13:34,856 --> 01:13:36,991
No, you know what,
you fucking stop, okay?

1261
01:13:37,092 --> 01:13:39,626
- Don't fucking move.
- Okay, no, I'm sorry.

1262
01:13:39,727 --> 01:13:40,829
I'm sorry, just, no, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, no no, tell them I'm sorry.

1265
01:13:45,666 --> 01:13:47,634
Yeah, it's a little
late for sorries, Trent.

1266
01:13:47,735 --> 01:13:49,337
Damn, I know my head wasn't on straight.

1267
01:13:49,437 --> 01:13:50,238
Yeah, no, here.

1268
01:13:50,338 --> 01:13:51,773
Here, here, here's the bag.

1269
01:13:51,873 --> 01:13:54,442
Here's the bag, now just don't hurt her.

She's bleeding, man, come on.

- No, just, she just...

01:24:46,895 --> 01:24:49,296
[map crumpling]

1456
01:24:49,396 --> 01:24:54,268
[bell tinkling]
[door creaking]

1457
01:24:54,368 --> 01:24:57,005
[tense music]

1458
01:25:07,082 --> 01:25:09,985
[paper crinkling]

1459
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:14,089
[insects buzzing]

1460
01:25:14,189 --> 01:25:17,558
[crunching footsteps]

1461
01:25:20,028 --> 01:25:20,929
Okay.

1462
01:25:23,664 --> 01:25:26,001
I need you to do something for me.

1463
01:25:27,635 --> 01:25:28,536
What?

1464
01:25:31,173 --> 01:25:34,408
I need you to swear to me,
swear you'll get this to Ali.

1465
01:25:34,508 --> 01:25:36,077
What do you mean, "Get this to Ali?"

1466
01:25:36,178 --> 01:25:37,645
If I don't make it.

1467
01:25:37,746 --> 01:25:38,612
You'll make it as long as you

1468
01:25:38,713 --> 01:25:40,414
- keep moving...
- Ben, stop.

1469
01:25:40,514 --> 01:25:43,617
I'm running pretty hard
from some pretty heavy shit.

1470
01:25:43,718 --> 01:25:46,955
- If you get there first.
- First?

1471
01:25:47,055 --> 01:25:50,192
- You've gotta help me.
- I am.

1472
01:25:50,292 --> 01:25:51,559
No, stop, please.

1473
01:25:51,659 --> 01:25:53,762
I got to get to her somehow.

1474
01:25:53,862 --> 01:25:54,963
If not in person,

1475
01:25:56,564 --> 01:26:00,068
if not in person, then by this.

1476
01:26:02,704 --> 01:26:05,439
- [sighs] Trent, I can't.
- You can.

1477
01:26:05,539 --> 01:26:07,075
You know these roads better than anyone.

1478
01:26:07,175 --> 01:26:10,245
Hell, you're probably the
best person who could do this.

1479
01:26:10,344 --> 01:26:12,446
[insects buzzing]

1480
01:26:12,546 --> 01:26:13,514
- I got my own problems...
- Ben.

1481
01:26:13,614 --> 01:26:14,716
I don't need to be screwing up yours.

1482
01:26:14,816 --> 01:26:18,586
Ben, people used me, took from me.

1483
01:26:19,486 --> 01:26:22,389
Maybe that's why I'm
running, but why I'm taking,

1484
01:26:23,859 --> 01:26:27,595
she's never asked for anything
from me, and this is me.

1485
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:32,466
Even shit as fucked up as
it is, this is who I am.

1486
01:26:34,435 --> 01:26:37,005
Yes, on the run, but I ran into you.

1487
01:26:37,105 --> 01:26:38,907
Maybe there's a reason for this.

1488
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:42,077
I mean, shit, look, look at us.

1489
01:26:42,978 --> 01:26:45,814
It seems pretty obvious
on this empty road.

1490
01:26:49,184 --> 01:26:50,118
I trust you, Ben.

1491
01:26:51,485 --> 01:26:54,655
[insects chirping]

1492
01:26:59,194 --> 01:27:02,496
[sighs] All right.

1493
01:27:06,334 --> 01:27:07,869
How do I find her?

1494
01:27:07,969 --> 01:27:10,604
There's a diner, it's on Colfax Avenue.

1495
01:27:10,705 --> 01:27:13,474
Be there at 11:15 am sharp.

1496
01:27:14,309 --> 01:27:15,442
Sit in the far back.

1497
01:27:15,542 --> 01:27:17,779
- Then what?
- Just wait.

1498
01:27:17,879 --> 01:27:20,115
She knows the location and the time.

1499
01:27:21,016 --> 01:27:23,084
And will she know that I'm with you?

1500
01:27:23,885 --> 01:27:27,155
When she gets up to the
table, call her girly.

1501
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:29,758
She'll know you're with me.

1502
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:33,161
All right.

1503
01:27:33,929 --> 01:27:36,597
[sighs] Thank you, I
can't thank you enough.

1504
01:27:38,432 --> 01:27:40,101
Head three miles up that road,

1505
01:27:40,201 --> 01:27:41,770
you'll find that truck stop.

1506
01:27:42,603 --> 01:27:43,437
Good luck.

1507
01:27:43,537 --> 01:27:46,841
[receding footsteps]

1508
01:27:49,144 --> 01:27:52,247
[gentle music]

1509
01:27:52,347 --> 01:27:53,647
Hey, do me a favor.

1510
01:27:55,516 --> 01:27:57,218
Like this isn't enough of one?

1511
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,854
Don't come back.

1512
01:28:01,455 --> 01:28:03,524
Here, out here.

1513
01:28:06,361 --> 01:28:08,629
She doesn't want the chase anymore.

1514
01:28:13,802 --> 01:28:15,236
I'll see you in Denver.

1515
01:28:17,504 --> 01:28:21,076
Hey, you owe me a cup of coffee.

1516
01:28:21,176 --> 01:28:22,609
All right.

1517
01:28:22,711 --> 01:28:26,014
[receding footsteps]

1518
01:28:33,955 --> 01:28:36,958

1520
01:28:45,033 --> 01:28:46,600
[sizzling]

1521
01:28:46,701 --> 01:28:49,670

1523
01:29:06,955 --> 01:29:09,724
[bell tinkling]

1524
01:29:29,210 --> 01:29:32,047
[bell tinkling]

1525
01:29:32,147 --> 01:29:35,250
[cutlery clattering]

1526
01:29:39,487 --> 01:29:40,688
Hey, can I get you something?

1527
01:29:40,789 --> 01:29:42,791
- Oh.
- Other than coffee?

1528
01:29:42,891 --> 01:29:44,926
No, coffee will be just fine, thank you.

1529
01:29:45,026 --> 01:29:47,594
Listen, are you, are you
sure I can't get you something?

1530
01:29:47,695 --> 01:29:49,596
Eggs, some bacon, I'm sure I can

1531
01:29:49,697 --> 01:29:51,232
rustle something up for you.

1532
01:29:51,332 --> 01:29:52,834
Thanks, but I'll be fine.

1533
01:29:54,436 --> 01:29:57,739
Wait, is that clock correct?

1534
01:29:58,973 --> 01:30:00,175
Yes, sir.

1535
01:30:00,275 --> 01:30:02,977
[gentle music]

1536
01:30:25,632 --> 01:30:28,669
[paper rustling]

1537
01:30:36,511 --> 01:30:37,745
[Trent] Hey girly.

1538
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:43,885
If you're reading this, it's
because I wasn't fast enough.

1539
01:30:45,587 --> 01:30:47,255
I'm so sorry for all this.

1540
01:30:48,323 --> 01:30:50,125
I saw a life that was perfect.

1541
01:30:51,593 --> 01:30:52,894
I was actually happy.

1542
01:30:54,329 --> 01:30:57,198
I can honestly say I don't
think I had ever been

1543
01:30:57,298 --> 01:31:01,302
truly happy with my life
until you were a part of it.

1544
01:31:02,370 --> 01:31:06,174
Out of all the mess in my
life, all the wrong, you,

1545
01:31:07,041 --> 01:31:09,711
you were the only thing
that made sense in it.

1546
01:31:10,545 --> 01:31:11,980
I just wanted to get away from the mess,

1547
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:15,717
get away from the lie I was living.

1548
01:31:16,918 --> 01:31:20,288
I wanted it so bad for us that
I ignored what it would cost.

1549
01:31:21,789 --> 01:31:23,591
[Trent & Michelle] What was that risk?

1550
01:31:23,691 --> 01:31:25,160
But you were worth it.

1551
01:31:26,327 --> 01:31:27,929
You are worth it.

1552
01:31:29,663 --> 01:31:31,332
[Michelle] And I need you to keep going.

1553
01:31:31,432 --> 01:31:34,769
You can show me that you
love me by moving forward.

1554
01:31:35,703 --> 01:31:36,838
Live for me.

1555
01:31:39,207 --> 01:31:42,310
[shuddering breaths]

1556
01:31:47,148 --> 01:31:48,249
