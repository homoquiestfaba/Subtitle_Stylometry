1
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:09,109
(ominous music)

2
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:09,769
(gasps)

3
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,983
(splashing)

4
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,560
(knocking)

5
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,062
- [Cody] Mom, Dad.

6
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,698
- There's the whelp.

7
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,199
- [Cody] You okay?

8
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,374
(flames crackling)

9
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,376
(gasps)

10
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:28,515
(grunts)

11
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,722
(bangs)

12
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,465
(screams)

13
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,740
(crashes)

14
00:02:58,845 --> 00:02:59,812
- Let it go!

15
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:01,581
It might fly back to the nest.

16
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,785
Might lead us to the others.

17
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:30,643
(dramatic music)

18
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,220
- Alright!

19
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,054
You with us?

20
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:48,888
You awake?

21
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,156
Let's go.

22
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:53,626
And reach, and reach,
 and reach, and reach,

23
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,862
and over, down.

24
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,997
And if you're thinking
 of lighting up,

25
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,066
you just put that
right out of your head.

26
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,702
You get right up here in
 front of like your TV stand

27
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,471
and you join us right
 now and one, and two,

28
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,706
and roll the spine.

29
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,008
And one, and two,
 roll in, and relax.

30
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,944
Roll it, let the
  head go, and jaw.

31
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:16,349
One, two, three, four, get
 ready for the twist and pop.

32
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,384
Twist, twist, and pop it.

33
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,086
One, two, three, and pop.

34
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:22,188
One, two, pull and kick.

35
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:23,022
Two, four.

36
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:23,856
Small.

37
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,359
Bigger.

38
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:30,263
Now eight big kicks and
one, two, three, four,

39
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,798
five, six, seven, eight.

40
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,032
And circle.

41
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:34,867
Cool it down and circle.

42
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:36,235
Cool it down reverse.

43
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,404
Down, cool it down.

44
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:43,710
Take a deep breath and
 hold it and let it go.

45
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:50,116
Now doesn't that
 make you feel alive?

46
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,853
(calm music)

47
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,718
- [Cody] Thanks.

48
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,131
- [Woman] Good morning,
Long Beach Post-Gazette.

49
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,398
May I help you?

50
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,201
- Here it comes.

51
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:44,504
I figured you'd be
 interested in this.

52
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,640
Stakes through the heart,
  mouths filled with dirt.

53
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,910
- Harry, the Butch Vlad
 jury's about to come back in.

54
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,612
Now would you like
  to get over there

55
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,781
or would you like
  them to drop by

56
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,949
and tell you what
  they've decided?

57
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,584
What's that?

58
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,754
- In Texas last night, 17
 year old boy stabs his parents

59
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,289
to death and burns
  the house down.

60
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,524
- Well, it doesn't
 say the kid did it.

61
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:05,892
What makes you think
 the kid did it?

62
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,393
- Because he took off.

63
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:08,995
They went through the house,
 couldn't find any part of him.

64
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,229
- They'll catch him.

65
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,264
He'll turn up at the
 Social Security office

66
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,132
looking for orphan's benefits.

67
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,634
- Ladies and
 gentlemen of the jury,

68
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,369
in the matter of the
 county of Los Angeles

69
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,603
versus Butcherbird Vlad,

70
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,906
have you reached a
 verdict in this case?

71
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,307
- No, your honor.

72
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,308
We the jury find...

73
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,510
(door bangs)

74
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,346
(crowd murmuring)

75
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,184
- Eli.

76
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,454
- [Man] It's Eli Chelarin.

77
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,692
(laughs)

78
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,195
- Your honor,

79
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:46,098
we the jury find ourselves
  hopelessly deadlocked.

80
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,367
(cheering)

81
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:51,437
- [Judge] Order.

82
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,339
I want order in this courtroom.

83
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,742
(gavel banging)

84
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:59,445
- Your honor, the prosecution
 requests an immediate date

85
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:00,646
for a new trial.

86
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,882
(shouting)

87
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:07,653
- Lorne!

88
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:09,922
Wait up.

89
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,090
It wasn't your fault.

90
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:11,891
- No?

91
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:12,825
Whose fault was it?

92
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,095
But I didn't get their
attention, I didn't reach them.

93
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:16,929
- You reached them.

94
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,831
So did somebody else.

95
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,605
Look, I've covered
  a lot of these

96
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:28,207
and you can never predict
  what a jury's gonna do.

97
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,745
- Mr. Martin, is there
 something I should know about?

98
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,682
- Absolutely.

99
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,151
I don't want anyone calling
 me Mr. but my mother.

100
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,956
(cheering)

101
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:48,527
- Hey!

102
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:01,340
- Well, Harry,

103
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,877
since the last thing I'd
  like to be is your mother,

104
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,647
how about you let me let
  you take me out to lunch?

105
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,751
- I would really love to but...

106
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:12,885
- But?

107
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,886
- But...

108
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:14,887
- A, you're married.

109
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,990
B, you're living with someone.

110
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,925
C, you're gay.

111
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,563
Or D, you're
 otherwise encumbered?

112
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,564
- D, I am otherwise encumbered.

113
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:30,403
Look, I gotta go, I gotta
  catch up with a guy.

114
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,072
I'll see you in court.

115
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:33,906
- Sure.

116
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:44,116
- Look, I've gotta go to
 this party on Sunday night.

117
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:45,851
It's kind of a family thing.

118
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,554
Would you like to go with me?

119
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,690
- What happened to D,
 otherwise encumbered?

120
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,326
- I'll call you at your office.

121
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,294
Eli!

122
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,400
- [Eli] Harry, Harry,
 what else could I do?

123
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,902
He's family.

124
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:06,372
How could I face Aunt Rodika
 if I let him go to prison?

125
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,841
- He broke an old lady's arm.

126
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:10,910
He stole her purse.

127
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,212
He urinated on a police officer.

128
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,648
He belongs in jail.

129
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:19,352
And you can't go around
 buying juries to keep him out.

130
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,186
- I can't?

131
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,990
Harry, what's the
  matter with you?

132
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,024
I just did.

133
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:27,893
And you can't prove it either.

134
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:32,865
And you wouldn't if
 you could, would you?

135
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,467
Because we're family too.

136
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:39,638
(phone ringing)

137
00:10:39,638 --> 00:10:40,606
Can't?

138
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:41,707
I don't wanna hear a can't.

139
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,642
Get those people out of there!

140
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:46,312
I want those leases on my
 desk before the end of the day

141
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,147
and I want the
  whole site leveled

142
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,448
before the end of the week.

143
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,986
That is what it is like now.

144
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,921
Shacks, hovels.

145
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,957
This is what it's going to be.

146
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:04,363
600 room international
 hotel, shopping mall,

147
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,965
a whole new city center.

148
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,202
The Long Beach Champs Elysees.

149
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,239
- There are people living
  in those hovels, Eli.

150
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,340
What about them?

151
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,343
- They'll find new
hovels, they always do.

152
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:22,248
Understand, Harry, I am
rebuilding this entire peninsula

153
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,416
from scratch.

154
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,251
I'm flying in
 timber from Oregon,

155
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,552
black sand from Fiji.

156
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,154
- Judges, Eli?

157
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:32,058
Did you buy the judge too?

158
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:35,528
- I'm a free market economist,
 everybody knows that.

159
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,763
But even I can only
 buy what's for sale.

160
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:40,566
- And you think
  that's everything.

161
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,201
- Oh, I know it is.

162
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,371
I went to see your
  bosses, Harry.

163
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,840
I complained about you.

164
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,742
- I know, I heard.

165
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:50,976
- Know what they did,

166
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:53,245
these people you write
 so diligently for,

167
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:56,148
who pay you less money
 than I pay my wine steward?

168
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:59,385
They offered to sell
 me the newspaper.

169
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,587
They offered to
 sell me you, Harry.

170
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:04,924
What would you do

171
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,460
if you suddenly found
yourself working for me?

172
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,128
- The honorable thing.

173
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,362
Quit.

174
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:12,631
Get a job playing a
 piano in a whorehouse.

175
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:13,833
- That's what I figured.

176
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,436
Otherwise I'd have
 bought the scurvy rag.

177
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:19,572
- You make things for sale, Eli.

178
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,674
You invent corruption.

179
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,410
- Don't you ever
 sell it short, Harry.

180
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,881
Corruption is the
 last untapped resource

181
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:31,317
of pure energy on the planet.

182
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,451
It feeds the market.

183
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:34,487
It drives the economy.

184
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,156
Corruption empowers, Harry.

185
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:41,160
And absolute corruption
empowers absolutely.

186
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,164
Save your country,
 screw somebody over.

187
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,235
Live better than everyone
  around you, Harry.

188
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,771
That is the patriotic way.

189
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,509
(growling)

190
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,644
(smashes)

191
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:05,050
(laughs)

192
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,219
- No, Eli, it's guys like you

193
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,522
that are sucking the
  life out of this country.

194
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:14,827
But you and I have
something more important

195
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,862
to talk about, Eli,
 because it looks

196
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:18,864
like it's starting up again.

197
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,032
- What?

198
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:20,866
What's starting?

199
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:26,572
(ominous music)

200
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,943
- Hickory stakes, damp earth.

201
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,044
It's starting again.

202
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,853
(calm music)

203
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,512
- What's the matter,
 country mouse?

204
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,346
You lost?

205
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:14,987
Not anymore.

206
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,457
We've been expecting you.

207
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,233
Welcome to Long Beach.

208
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,969
- What are you talking about?

209
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,737
What do you mean you've
been expecting me?

210
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:34,773
- They usually show up here,
 the strays, the flyaways.

211
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,312
You've been shot then.

212
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,581
Oh, they put one in ya.

213
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:43,682
- It's okay.

214
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:44,717
I heal fast.

215
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,918
- I know, we do, we do.

216
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,288
- Look...

217
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,524
The guy that owns this
 place, Mr. Chelarin,

218
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,361
I'm supposed to look him up.

219
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,862
It's important.

220
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:57,663
Y'all wouldn't happen to
  know where I can find him,

221
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,164
would you?

222
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:01,033
- Well, I guess this is your
 lucky day, country mouse,

223
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,769
because it just so
 happens that we do.

224
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:09,074
(engines rumbling)

225
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:18,951
- Hey, where we going?

226
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,452
- Someplace you're gonna like.

227
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,890
At least you won't be
 sleeping in a barn tonight.

228
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,091
(laughs)

229
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,327
- Yeah, well, who's this
Chelarin guy anyhow?

230
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,161
- He's my uncle.

231
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,231
Maybe your uncle too.

232
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,001
(cheering)

233
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:36,835
Hold on.

234
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,575
(upbeat music)

235
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,400
(laughs)

236
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:13,739
- Slivovitz?

237
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,741
(sighs)

238
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:19,978
- Harry, this is wonderful.

239
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:21,947
I mean, I didn't realize you
 were part of all of this.

240
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,515
- You mean funny I
 don't look Carpathian?

241
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:24,850
- Yeah, that's what I mean.

242
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,587
I mean, Harry Martin, what
  kind of a name is that?

243
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:29,922
- Harlevon Martinescu.

244
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,760
Shortened for bylines and
  book jackets, someday.

245
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:39,098
(laughs)

246
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:44,937
- I have to confess, geography
 was never my strong area.

247
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,939
I'm not even sure
 where Carpathia is.

248
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:50,642
And isn't it somewhere
 near Transylvania?

249
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:51,744
- In the neighborhood.

250
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,447
- I like the neighborhood.

251
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,017
- [Harry] Oh.

252
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:00,185
(gasps)

253
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,489
- Whoa, Councilor, excuse me.

254
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:04,456
- Evening, Judge.

255
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,395
Harry, that was Judge Morgan.

256
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,030
What's he doing here?

257
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,965
- Well, Eli Chelarin is
a friend to politicians

258
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:15,300
of every stripe
  and predilection.

259
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,635
- I guess.

260
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,004
I've already seen three
judges, a congressman,

261
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,105
two city councilmen.

262
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,540
- And a DA in a pear tree.

263
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:24,943
- Not me.

264
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,979
I'm not on that list,
 I'm here with you.

265
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,215
- Well, how would you like
 to get out of here with me?

266
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:34,153
Go someplace quiet,
 get a cup of coffee?

267
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,354
- Well, wouldn't
 that be kind of rude?

268
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,222
I mean, I haven't
 even met our host yet.

269
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:39,291
- Well, I can fix that.

270
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:01,046
There he is.

271
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,714
That's Eli Chelarin.

272
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:07,886
(crowd gasps)

273
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,690
- Is that his wife?

274
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,358
Oh, she's beautiful.

275
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:19,965
- That's his sister.

276
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:22,901
His half sister.

277
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,342
(crowd gasps)

278
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,514
(shouting)

279
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:45,557
(slow music)

280
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,938
(kisses)

281
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:04,877
- What's going on?

282
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:05,711
Who's that kid?

283
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,014
- Wait here for
  me, I'll be back.

284
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,093
- Happy birthday, Uncle Eli.

285
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:26,498
- [Cody] To Mr. Chelarin.

286
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,267
- What did your
 folks tell you, son,

287
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:31,803
about your background,
 about your people?

288
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,239
- Nothing much.

289
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,408
I didn't think there
 was much to tell.

290
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,377
They came from Europe someplace

291
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:39,311
and, well, they
 didn't even know much

292
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,579
about ranching or cattle.

293
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,115
- Your parents were old
friends of ours, Cody.

294
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,785
From before they
 decided to move out.

295
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,987
You did right to come back here.

296
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:50,822
- What about the guys
 who killed 'em, huh?

297
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,558
I want to go back
 there, Mr. Chelarin.

298
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,026
I want to get those guys.

299
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,361
- You won't have
  to go after them.

300
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,430
They're going to show up here.

301
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,033
(upbeat music)

302
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:04,369
- Don't worry, he'll be
back in a little while.

303
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,705
- Thank you.

304
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,273
- Just a little
  emergency meeting

305
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:11,276
of the Carpathian Health
and Welfare Society.

306
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,879
Harry's on the board.

307
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,184
(cheering)

308
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,422
Have you known him long?

309
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,457
- Just a couple of weeks.

310
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,359
We're just friends.

311
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:30,028
- Wow, lucky for you.

312
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:31,897
Harry--

313
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,731
- Celia.

314
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:38,804
- Harry can be a very...

315
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,240
Delightful friend.

316
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:56,488
- They say she had a husband
 once but she ate him.

317
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,125
Dance with me.

318
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,194
Maybe it'll change your luck.

319
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,062
- My luck is fine.

320
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,530
- Didn't look like
  that in court.

321
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,566
I guess I put a dent
 in your career, huh?

322
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:12,404
- All you did, Butch, was put
 a bigger price on your head.

323
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,806
Now every cop in Long Beach
 has your picture pasted

324
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,174
to his shotgun.

325
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:17,809
- My goodness, Miss Lorne.

326
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,347
I didn't realize you
 were so bloodthirsty.

327
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:29,187
Have you ever made love
on a moving motorcycle?

328
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:31,089
It can be done.

329
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,994
- Do you have any idea
where I can find Harry?

330
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,333
- You know, I think
 that the last thing

331
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:45,037
Harlevon needs right now is you.

332
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,044
(cheering)

333
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,488
- They should have told him.

334
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,290
It was their
obligation to tell him.

335
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:10,128
Now, somebody has to do it.

336
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,863
- It will be a shock for him.

337
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,633
Harlevon, you do
  it, you tell him.

338
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:16,835
When he's ready.

339
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,975
- He says he doesn't
think they followed him.

340
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,977
- That boy didn't escape.

341
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:27,813
The hunters let him get away.

342
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,749
They'll show up here soon.

343
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:32,651
Count on it.

344
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,319
- And we'll be ready for them.

345
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,787
- No, we won't.

346
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:38,490
- What do you think we
 ought to do about it, Harry?

347
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,324
Call a cop?

348
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:40,992
(laughs)

349
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,160
- Yeah.

350
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,195
Call a cop.

351
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,331
We live in this country.

352
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:50,235
We have lived in this country
 for three, four generations.

353
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:53,171
We're Americans,
 Carpathian Americans.

354
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:56,141
We work here, we vote
 here, we pay taxes.

355
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:58,477
We're entitled to the
 protection of the law.

356
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,948
I think it's time we came
  out of the damn coffin.

357
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:06,251
- Alright, Harry, claim
your civil rights.

358
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:08,487
You go on out there and explain

359
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:11,790
to good affordable
 American Judge Morgan

360
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,861
how your parents,
 grandparents lived in a cave.

361
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:20,065
How they dropped from trees
 onto the backs of travelers

362
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,601
and gorged on their blood.

363
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:26,705
Explain to your little
 (mumbles) from the DA's office

364
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:30,609
how after the slaughter they
 just lay there on the road

365
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:33,578
like ticks too bloated to move,

366
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:38,083
licking the last
sweet corpuscles

367
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,085
from the tips of their fingers.

368
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,089
- Fine, Eli.

369
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,057
Meanwhile, her ancestors were
 clubbing their brains out

370
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:47,692
on the peat bogs of Ireland.

371
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,262
We're all trying
  to get civilized.

372
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,430
It's just some of us
 have a little trouble

373
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,765
getting the hang of it.

374
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:58,303
- I, for instance, don't
get the hang of it?

375
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:03,575
- We cannot go on doing
 everything in the old ways.

376
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,779
- You mean if you can't like
 them, join them, right, Harry?

377
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,817
That's all you've really
ever wanted, isn't it?

378
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:13,919
To be one of them.

379
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,825
- I am as good a Carpathian
 as any man in this room.

380
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:24,963
- You are a damned
  assimilationist

381
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,966
and I may not be civilized,

382
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,835
but I'm also not the
 one who's slipping it

383
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,236
to the Pillsbury dough girl.

384
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,106
First you sleep with them.

385
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:37,843
Next you're breeding with them.

386
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:41,546
Then you've got to strangle
 some half breed little bastard

387
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:45,050
in its cradle because
 it will grow up

388
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,018
and drive a stake
 through your heart!

389
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:50,789
- That is racist crap,
 Eli, and you know it!

390
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:51,623
- Is it?

391
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:57,495
What are you going to
 do about it, Harry?

392
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:58,330
Bite me?

393
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:01,733
Go for my throat?

394
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:04,736
You've lost the taste for
  such things, haven't you?

395
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:07,405
(growling)

396
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:08,940
- Enough!

397
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,108
Eli, Harlevon.

398
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:14,713
That's enough. Is that what
 you two are going to be doing

399
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,248
when these hunters show up?

400
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,049
Biting and snapping
 at each other?

401
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:20,952
They're lighting up
 their fiery torches

402
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:23,221
and unleashing their hounds!

403
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:27,726
When the pogrom begins,
 we're all in this together.

404
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:31,663
We are to watch, stay alert,
 see where they show themselves

405
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:35,166
or they'll slay us every one.

406
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:44,676
Harry.

407
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:47,412
- I'm sorry, Vasile.

408
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,682
I let get Eli get
  a hook into me.

409
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,852
You have the right
  to expect better.

410
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:55,353
- Yes, I do.

411
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,390
These hunters, they
 have to be found,

412
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,659
they have to be stopped
  before they hurt anybody.

413
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:02,594
- I'm working on it.

414
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:03,528
- Good.

415
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:05,497
I know I can depend on you.

416
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:09,434
About the woman,
  Harry, is it true?

417
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,406
- Whether it is or
  whether it isn't,

418
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,508
it's nobody's business but mine.

419
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:18,810
- And hers.

420
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:23,181
(upbeat music)

421
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:06,691
(kettle whistling)

422
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:07,525
- [Amy] Is decaffeinated okay?

423
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:08,360
It's all I've got.

424
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:10,996
- Perfect.

425
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:14,399
- You people made it seem like
 the return of the prodigal.

426
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:15,834
- We have a taste
 for the melodramatic,

427
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,836
comes from too much inbreeding.

428
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,437
(laughs)

429
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:21,773
- I had fun tonight, Harry.

430
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:23,742
Your family's sweet.

431
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:26,111
Well, most of 'em.

432
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:29,447
What sort of a medallion
was that boy wearing?

433
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:31,049
- Oh...

434
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:34,619
A cameo of Lilith
 cut in blood amber.

435
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,121
It's a good luck charm.

436
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,622
- Oh, I know Lilith.

437
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:42,527
Sort of a goddess or a demon
 from rabbinical mythology.

438
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:44,696
- She was Adam's first wife.

439
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:45,830
- You're kidding me, right?

440
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,066
- It's in the
 Apocrypha, look it up.

441
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,835
Before Eve, Adam was
 married to Lilith.

442
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:53,038
- And?

443
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:55,573
- Well, she got pushy.

444
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:56,941
When they made love,

445
00:27:56,941 --> 00:28:01,513
(laughs) she wanted to be...

446
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:04,783
- On top?

447
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:05,950
- Yeah.

448
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,686
(laughs)

449
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:11,489
And Adam said no and she said
 "Okay, then I have a headache"

450
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:13,591
and so Adam went whining to God

451
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:17,195
and God, who at this point
  didn't have a whole lot

452
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,697
of experience with complaints,

453
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:22,033
said okay, he would
 have one more shot

454
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,701
at making a better
  tempered woman.

455
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:24,969
The rest you know.

456
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:27,672
He put Eve together
 out of spare parts.

457
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:32,610
- Well, I would never do that.

458
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,314
- Do what?

459
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:38,750
- Insist.

460
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:41,853
A lady waits to be asked.

461
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:45,623
- And...

462
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:46,524
You're a lady.

463
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,594
- Mostly.

464
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:52,764
(kissing)

465
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,637
(sighs)

466
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,541
Why have I been waiting
to do that all evening?

467
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,477
- Oh, there's
 something about me,

468
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,378
sense of mystery,
  hint of danger.

469
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:17,755
- Right, you know?

470
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:18,590
There is.

471
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,462
So what happened to Lilith?

472
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:28,333
- Oh, she took off, hooked
 up with a guy named Asmodeus.

473
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,102
And started up her own group.

474
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,570
- I remember.

475
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,038
This is where all of the
 hobgoblins come from, right?

476
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:38,576
All of the fiends and
  hellhounds and succubuses.

477
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,180
You don't believe
 in all that, do you?

478
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:47,252
Female creatures who
 visit men in the night

479
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:52,257
and seduce them in their
  beds and suck their blood.

480
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:56,227
(kissing)

481
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:03,835
- Amy?

482
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:07,805
There's something you
 need to know about me,

483
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:09,974
about my family,

484
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:13,411
before you even thought about
 getting involved with a...

485
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:14,646
(kisses) Guy like me.

486
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,515
- Harry, Harry.

487
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:20,685
Can we talk about
 this in the morning?

488
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:25,990
- If I don't stay,

489
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,426
I'm gonna be sorry, aren't I?

490
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:32,230
(kissing)

491
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:43,608
I'll call you.

492
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,985
(flames crackling)

493
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:05,763
(gasps)

494
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,400
(howling)

495
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:31,189
- Come on, country mouse.

496
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:34,626
We're gonna help you get
 your mind off your troubles.

497
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,930
(cheering)

498
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,838
- How you doing, cousin?

499
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:52,243
- See, I told you we're
a very loving family.

500
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,279
(laughs)

501
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:57,749
Come on!

502
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:02,620
Okay, let's go!

503
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,292
Come on, we need to go.

504
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:23,341
(phone ringing)

505
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:26,444
- [Harry] You were right,
  I'm sorry I didn't stay.

506
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,414
- Oh, me too.

507
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:32,583
I was just lying here, thinking,

508
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,118
well, maybe I frightened you off

509
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,586
because I know
 European men, well,

510
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,855
they don't expect a woman
  to come on like that.

511
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:40,325
They expect them to
 be demure and ladylike

512
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:41,959
and wait to be asked.

513
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:42,894
- Okay, I'm asking.

514
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,264
- [Amy] Harry, what's
 going on with you?

515
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:47,498
I don't understand.

516
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:48,566
I really enjoyed the party,

517
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,702
your family was so neat but...

518
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:53,071
(slow music)

519
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:58,209
I met this guy and
 he was really nice.

520
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,111
He talked me into
  buying this condo.

521
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:05,016
And (mumbles) but it's
  fine, I really like it...

522
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,319
- Amy.

523
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,522
What about we have dinner
  sometime this week?

524
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:12,724
How about Friday night?

525
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:16,861
- Let's see, Friday night.

526
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:19,564
Yeah, yeah, I think I
  can make it Friday night.

527
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:22,333
I've got a court date
 but it won't run long.

528
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,702
It's an armed robbery case
  and the guy has two priors

529
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:27,438
and I think they'll
 bargain a deal.

530
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:28,973
What did you have in mind?

531
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:29,807
Harry?

532
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:31,776
Are you there?

533
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:34,112
How do you feel about Greek?

534
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,181
You know the...

535
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,050
- She's not for you, Harry.

536
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:41,085
She's a Twinkie.

537
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:47,091
All blonde and sticky
 and full of white goo.

538
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:49,560
But you know what I'm full of.

539
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,062
You do, don't you?

540
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,665
- Amy, look, I've got
 something boiling over here.

541
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,234
I'll call you in the morning.

542
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:02,039
(kissing)

543
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:04,275
(cheering)

544
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:20,158
- Oh yeah!

545
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,239
(moaning)

546
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:55,927
(laughs)

547
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,632
(moaning)

548
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:03,801
(howling)

549
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,607
(banging)

550
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,344
(laughs)

551
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:29,727
(kissing)

552
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,752
(slow music)

553
00:36:12,169 --> 00:36:14,572
- Alright, you with
 this, you awake?

554
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:16,073
Let's go.

555
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:20,011
And reach, and reach, and
  reach, and reach, and--

556
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,180
(smashes)

557
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:27,151
- Celia.

558
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:30,321
- Yes, Harry?

559
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:31,422
- Use the door.

560
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:39,530
(slow music)

561
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:44,569
(waves rushing)

562
00:36:58,749 --> 00:36:59,584
- Celia.

563
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,788
Where have you been?

564
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:06,891
- Oh, couldn't sleep.

565
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:10,094
(sighs)

566
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,798
I took a drive along the coast,

567
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,634
watched the sun come up.

568
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,771
So have a nice day.

569
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,812
(sighs) Satisfied?

570
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:35,486
- No, Amy, if you could
just check this out

571
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:37,188
with the Texas
 authorities for me.

572
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:40,258
No, I really do want to
talk about last night.

573
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,627
Look, how about you run down
 this Texas thing for me,

574
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:45,129
I'll come by your office,
  I'll explain everything.

575
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:00,845
(phone ringing)

576
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:03,714
- Okay, here it is.

577
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,184
They've dropped the
  murder warrant on the boy.

578
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:09,053
They don't think he did it.

579
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,855
But they will be wanting him
 back for material witness.

580
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:12,490
- Do they have any suspects?

581
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,091
- Really, Harry, the
 taxpayers don't pay me

582
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:15,226
to be your private detective.

583
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:17,194
Now if you don't mind,

584
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:18,996
my caseload is a
 little backed up here.

585
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:21,032
- Amy, this is important.

586
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,734
- Why?

587
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:25,336
Why is something that happened
 all the way down in Texas

588
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:26,671
so important to you?

589
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:28,906
- Well, I promised Marv
I'd do a feature story

590
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:31,108
on these ritual murders
 that seem to keep escalating

591
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:31,909
around the country.

592
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:32,743
That's all.

593
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:33,644
- Of course.

594
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,847
And reporters have to
cultivate their sources.

595
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:41,352
- Amy, I promise you that isn't
what last night was about.

596
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,554
My motives were far
more sinister than that.

597
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:47,758
- But your family has
  rules about seeing people

598
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:50,227
who aren't ethnically correct.

599
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:52,063
A little reverse discrimination.

600
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:55,332
Well, I guess I'm blonde
enough to deal with it.

601
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,369
- I know, I believe you are.

602
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:00,871
- Okay.

603
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:04,875
The forensic guys in Texas
  say at least two people

604
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:07,211
did the killings,
  probably three.

605
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,913
- Any witnesses, any clues?

606
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:12,616
- Whoever they were,
 they've evaporated.

607
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:14,185
Maybe even left the state.

608
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:18,055
- Amy, thanks for this.

609
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:19,090
I've gotta find Cody.

610
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:22,626
We're still on
  for Friday, right?

611
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,097
- I'm not sure that's
 such a good idea.

612
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,338
- What are you afraid of?

613
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:38,642
- That I want to,
 more than I should.

614
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,312
That's what I'm afraid of.

615
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:46,083
- Me too.

616
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:53,357
Look, I've gotta go cover the
 Alex Smart TV show Friday.

617
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:54,425
It's for this piece I'm writing.

618
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:55,259
Come with me.

619
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,530
I'll pick you up around four.

620
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,364
- Harry?

621
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:07,438
I'm getting some mixed
 signals from you.

622
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,674
Is this a date or
 just an opportunity

623
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:12,510
to see an ace reporter at work?

624
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,477
- A little of each.

625
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:16,413
After the show,
  I'm gonna take you

626
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:20,017
to the finest Carpathian
 restaurant in North America.

627
00:40:26,423 --> 00:40:28,426
(sighs)

628
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,616
(yawns)

629
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:02,393
- It's a little early
 in the day, vamp.

630
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,630
We usually don't get started
 around here till tea time.

631
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,733
- Give it back to me!

632
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:10,568
- What?

633
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:12,503
This?

634
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:16,540
You gave me this,
 don't you remember?

635
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,676
It was a token of
  our friendship.

636
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,146
- Well, let me tell
 you this, city mouse.

637
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,814
That belonged to my grandmother

638
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:27,384
and if you don't give it back,
 I'm gonna rip your face off.

639
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:29,286
- I thought we were
 blood brothers.

640
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:31,889
(grunts)

641
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,958
(shouts)

642
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,060
Whoa!

643
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,997
Does it mean that much
to you, this old brooch?

644
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:44,068
Well, let me tell you
 something about your grandma.

645
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,670
She sucked.

646
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,539
(laughs)

647
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:51,242
- You're a foulmouthed
 son of a bitch.

648
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:54,144
- Oh, yeah, I am that.

649
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:57,448
I'm also a thief and a liar

650
00:41:57,448 --> 00:42:00,384
and a poor sport.

651
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:02,620
(squeals)

652
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:06,690
Because what I say
 is you got the name,

653
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,526
you might as well
  have the game, hm?

654
00:42:09,526 --> 00:42:11,061
(laughs)

655
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:12,263
- What game?

656
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:14,365
- Called Devil
  Take the Hindmost.

657
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:17,368
And there are only two rules.

658
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,537
Grab what you want
 and don't get caught.

659
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:25,643
Now that shouldn't be
so difficult to manage,

660
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:28,078
even for a dumb rodeo vamp.

661
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:29,914
- Why do you keep
  calling me that?

662
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:31,415
- If I don't, they will.

663
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,686
They won't ever let
you forget what you are

664
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:36,887
so why even bother?

665
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:43,560
You really don't know
what I'm talking about?

666
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:46,063
They haven't told you?

667
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:51,235
Well, then I guess it's
time you found out.

668
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,469
You're one of us, vamp.

669
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,408
Spawn of hell.

670
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,811
Creatures from the dark side.

671
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,347
Monsters.

672
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:04,181
Fiends!

673
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:06,550
You might as well get behind it

674
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,520
because it's your birthright.

675
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,921
Because hey, hey, hey, see?

676
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:15,926
Your grandma, your mama,
your daddy, all of 'em,

677
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:16,794
drank.

678
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:20,164
Blood.

679
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:21,765
(laughs)

680
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,100
- Liar!

681
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,369
(cheering)

682
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,506
(grunts)

683
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,879
(growling)

684
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:02,773
- Enough, enough!

685
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:12,516
What did you tell him?

686
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:14,485
- Nothing, Harlevon.

687
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,053
I didn't tell him anything.

688
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:33,570
- That's it, isn't it?

689
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:36,440
My parents, they were vampires.

690
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,142
And you, you're a vampire too.

691
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:41,111
- Don't let me ever again
  hear you use that word.

692
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:42,279
It's an ugly word.

693
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:46,850
You're a Carpathian.

694
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,052
Your parents were.

695
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:49,453
We're all Carpathians.

696
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:54,358
- So this means what, that
  I get to live forever or?

697
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,027
- No, you don't get
 to live forever.

698
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,729
100, 125 maybe.

699
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:01,799
- Well, how old are you?

700
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:03,367
- A little older than I look.

701
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,904
- Oh, so if I like bite
somebody on the neck,

702
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:07,971
does that give me
  power over them

703
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:09,840
and then they become one and...

704
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,241
- For god's sakes, Cody,

705
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:12,910
where did you pick
  up all this crap?

706
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,845
Didn't your parents
 teach you anything?

707
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:17,614
Sorry.

708
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:23,687
Well, maybe it's time we talked
about a couple of things.

709
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:25,622
We're stronger than people.

710
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:28,692
10, 20, it depends,
 30% stronger.

711
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:30,327
And we heal faster.

712
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:32,596
- And it takes a wooden shaft

713
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:34,865
or a silver bullet
  to kill us, right?

714
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:37,367
- Wouldn't stand in front
  of any moving taxi cabs.

715
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,704
- But we are better in
 the sack, am I right?

716
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:43,006
20, 30%?

717
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:46,176
I knew that.

718
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:47,144
I always knew that.

719
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:50,447
And then they do what?

720
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:51,982
- It's a beautiful
  thing that happens

721
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:55,119
between a male and a
  female Carpathian when...

722
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,988
At the propitious moment...

723
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:01,859
Look, it's like when
 two animals become

724
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:03,293
highly sexually aroused

725
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:05,829
at, you know...

726
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:09,533
Come on, Cody, what is
 this, the bats and the bees?

727
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,168
I can't do this.

728
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:12,703
- Okay, okay, I get it.

729
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:16,573
So what you're telling me
  is that when two of us...

730
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:19,009
- [Harry] Make love.

731
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:22,012
- Yeah, that we sometimes...

732
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:25,349
Bite each other?

733
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:27,618
- It's an acquired taste.

734
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,920
But you only do that
 if the woman wants to,

735
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,921
you know what I mean?

736
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:31,855
- Oh, sure.

737
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:33,323
Consenting adults, right, Harry?

738
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:38,495
So you do this to
 like regular women or?

739
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,166
- [Harry] They're
 mostly not into that.

740
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:43,667
- Oh.

741
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:45,335
Well, what about that girl
 you were with at the party?

742
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:46,270
Does she like?

743
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:48,338
- That is none of your business.

744
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:49,973
- What about my folks?

745
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:51,642
Do you suppose they?

746
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,110
(laughs)

747
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,312
I don't even want
 to picture that one.

748
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:56,547
I guess I always did know

749
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:58,882
that my parents were
 a little strange.

750
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:00,884
I mean, most of my
 friends thought so.

751
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,854
You know, they were
 kind of old country.

752
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:08,058
But they were my
 folks and I loved 'em.

753
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:09,459
I mean, I still do love 'em.

754
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:12,362
But how come, Harry?

755
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:15,532
I mean, how come
  they never told me

756
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:17,201
that they were nothing
  but a pair of damn vamp...

757
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:20,571
I'm sorry.

758
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:27,010
Where the hell are these
 guys, these vampire hunters?

759
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,912
I mean, why don't
 they show themselves?

760
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:31,048
Or why don't they
  just do something?

761
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:31,882
- They will.

762
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:37,421
But they'll pick their time
 and they'll pick their target.

763
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:38,789
- Yeah, and we'll
  be there, right?

764
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:39,723
And then we'll get 'em.

765
00:47:39,723 --> 00:47:41,758
- No, I'll be there, Cody.

766
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:44,828
It's my job to handle
 this in a certain way.

767
00:47:44,828 --> 00:47:45,829
- What way?

768
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:47,397
- The right way, the legal way.

769
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:50,000
If I can.

770
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,770
(calm music)

771
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:34,278
- Actually, he prefers
 his whiskey neat

772
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:35,946
and his women naked.

773
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:42,119
But if you want my best
advice, get a tattoo.

774
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:49,426
- Damn her.

775
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,069
(ominous music)

776
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:18,221
(waves rushing)

777
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:23,193
- [Man] Win $1,000 if they...

778
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:24,695
- Is he one of us?

779
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:26,196
- [Woman] I don't know, maybe.

780
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:29,099
- What about her, is she?

781
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:32,235
- Cody, why do you
 keep asking me this?

782
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:33,704
I don't know.

783
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:35,505
- Well, because I want
  to know how you can tell.

784
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:36,973
- Sometimes you can't.

785
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:38,975
Sometimes you just know.

786
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:41,311
- Well, what about this guy?

787
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:42,713
Is he one?

788
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:47,718
- Because these three
 citizens say we have vampires

789
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:50,354
living next door to us.

790
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:51,822
(audience laughs)

791
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,891
Next time you want to go borrow
a cup of coffee... (laughs)

792
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:03,934
- It's them!

793
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:05,035
Mr. Chelarin!

794
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:07,971
(audience laughs)

795
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:09,339
- Don't be silly, Cody.

796
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:12,042
These are just three
of our local crackpots.

797
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:13,977
- Not those three, a
 man in the audience.

798
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:15,278
- I'll be right back!

799
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:18,148
- Oh my god, it's them.

800
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:20,183
(breathing heavily)

801
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,853
(ominous music)

802
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:25,155
Where is that place?

803
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:25,989
I've gotta get over there.

804
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:27,024
Please, Mr. Chelarin.

805
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,692
I can't let them get away.

806
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:30,894
- Butcherbird.

807
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:34,564
Go with him.

808
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:42,205
- Let's hit it.

809
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:51,148
- Okay, we're talking
 with these folks

810
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:55,886
from the Western Regional
  Branch of the SCAV.

811
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,387
That stands for...

812
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,323
- The Southern Coalition
Against Vampirism.

813
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:01,057
(audience laughs)

814
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:02,459
- Okay.

815
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:05,595
So what you people are
 saying, check me out on this,

816
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:09,866
is that we have actual blood
 sucking vampires living

817
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:11,868
all right in amongst us.

818
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:12,803
- Yes.
- That's right.

819
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:14,604
- So anybody could be one.

820
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:18,041
My neighbor could be one,
  my dentist could be one.

821
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:19,476
Even my ex-wife could be one.

822
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:22,746
So what you're saying,
 what you're telling...

823
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:25,549
Don't be afraid, I'm
 not gonna bite you.

824
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:27,451
What you're telling us,

825
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:30,787
we could have, we could
have them right here

826
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:32,823
in this very room.

827
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:37,194
Killer vampires in
 this very audience!

828
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:38,161
(audience laughs)

829
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:39,663
Alright, now quiet, everybody.

830
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:42,966
Okay, now ladies,

831
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:45,535
take a look at the guy
 sitting next to you.

832
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:49,272
Is he starting to whistle
  Fangs for the Mammaries?

833
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,740
(audience laughs)

834
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:51,741
- You know who they are!

835
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:52,576
- Who?

836
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:54,211
- You don't have to ask.

837
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:55,312
You've seen their eyes.

838
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:56,146
- Their eyes?

839
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:57,113
- [Woman] They're dirty.

840
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:58,882
- They have dirty eyes?

841
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:00,450
- They are disgusting!

842
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,752
It's disgusting when you
 have to be in the same room

843
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:06,122
with one or if you have to
 sit down next to one on a bus.

844
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:07,624
- [Host] I think I
  know the gentleman

845
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,226
to whom you're referring. I
 sat next to him on the bus

846
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:12,195
on the way to work this
morning, but frankly...

847
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:13,029
- Harry.

848
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:14,798
Harry, look over there.

849
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:17,534
I've seen that guy before,
 the one in the blond beard?

850
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:19,903
At Fashion Island, I was
in the lingerie shop.

851
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:21,104
Celia was there.

852
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:25,242
It looked like he
  was following her.

853
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:26,643
- [Host] For the
  sake of argument,

854
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,746
let's say we meet one
 of these characters...

855
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:31,882
- You know who they
 are, don't you?

856
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:33,483
You knew they'd be here.

857
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:34,317
- Thought they might.

858
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,852
I wasn't sure.

859
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:38,788
- We bring some things that
 the ordinary citizen can use

860
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:42,259
to protect himself
  against attack.

861
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:44,261
Here's some garlic.

862
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:45,862
They hate this.

863
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:48,698
- [Host] Oh, well, I love
  garlic, so I'm okay there.

864
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:50,934
- [Man] Then you got your cross.

865
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:52,769
- Don't stare at them.

866
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:56,206
- And a small hand mirror.

867
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:57,974
You hold this up
to their face...

868
00:52:57,974 --> 00:52:59,910
(gasps)
  (audience laughs)

869
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,012
Vampire can't see
  his reflection.

870
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,480
See, that drives him crazy.

871
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,614
- Put it down yet?

872
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:05,815
- Yeah.

873
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:06,650
- Good, okay.

874
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:08,051
One last question.

875
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:10,453
If you don't have any
 garlic in the house,

876
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:13,356
can you use a pepperoni?

877
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,825
(audience laughs)

878
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:18,094
I'm kidding,
 alright, I'm kidding!

879
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:21,264
Can we all just lighten up
 there for a second, alright?

880
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:22,899
We're all getting
  a little tense.

881
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:24,834
Let's take a hot tub and get...

882
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:25,835
- You fools.

883
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:28,572
What are you laughing at?

884
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:30,407
Don't you know we
 have come to warn you?

885
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,943
- I know, wait here.

886
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:34,211
- I mean it.

887
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,146
- [Woman] What are
  you waiting for?

888
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:39,783
Till they take your
 parking places, your wives?

889
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:40,717
Your jobs?

890
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:46,456
They want your jobs!

891
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:57,233
(ominous music)

892
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:09,379
- [Man] Back, foul thing.

893
00:54:09,379 --> 00:54:12,115
- Please, get that thing out
 of my face or I'm gonna...

894
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:14,818
On second thought, the cross
 will probably do the job.

895
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:17,821
Guys, look, I'm
  a reporter, okay?

896
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:19,422
I work for the Post-Gazette.

897
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:23,760
- We know who and what
you are, Mr. Martinescu.

898
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:29,032
- Then we might as well
get to the crux of it.

899
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:30,267
You killed some folks.

900
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,035
You're gonna have
  to pay for that.

901
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:33,470
- They were brutes.

902
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,005
They were demons.

903
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:36,172
- Weren't bothering anybody.

904
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:38,341
They had as much
 right to live as you.

905
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:41,278
Now, you can either answer
  up in a Texas courtroom...

906
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,545
- Or?

907
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:44,314
- If any of my people
 saw you on television,

908
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:46,016
they're already
  on their way here.

909
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:50,020
- I guess it does
  pay to advertise.

910
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,657
- Now listen to me, you
  half-witted stump jumper,

911
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:55,392
I want to see an end
 to this bloodletting

912
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:58,395
that's been going on between
our people for 100 generations.

913
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,499
- Harry, what's going on?

914
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:04,000
- Amy, get out of here.

915
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,436
- That's the one that's
  fornicating with this one.

916
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:08,004
- We have not fornicated.

917
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:10,774
Why is this suddenly
 everybody's business?

918
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:12,275
Whoa.

919
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:13,410
- Kill it.

920
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:14,310
Kill 'em both.

921
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:16,446
(yelps)

922
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:18,515
(shouts)

923
00:55:19,382 --> 00:55:21,551
(screams)

924
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,536
(tires squealing)

925
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:46,776
(sighs)

926
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:57,487
(tires squealing)

927
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:58,488
- Where are they?

928
00:55:58,488 --> 00:55:59,322
- Gone.

929
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:00,590
They got away.

930
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:02,192
- You warned 'em,
  didn't you, Harry?

931
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,394
You told 'em we
 were coming, right?

932
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:06,796
- I had to give them a
 chance to turn themselves in.

933
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:09,399
- No, you had to rip their
lungs out is what you had to do.

934
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:15,805
Let's get out of here.

935
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:24,080
(tires squealing)

936
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,683
(upbeat music)

937
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:35,925
- You're beginning to
 sound like one of us, vamp.

938
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:39,596
Maybe it's time you had
a horse of your own.

939
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:44,000
(cheering)

940
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:57,881
- Are you okay?

941
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:00,650
Well, gee, Harry,

942
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:02,452
it looks like you're
  forever trying to save me.

943
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:03,787
One of these days, you're
  gonna have to decide

944
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:05,622
whether to throw
 me back or keep me.

945
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:08,691
Okay, I know you told
 me to stay there.

946
00:57:08,691 --> 00:57:10,760
- That's right, I told
 you to stay there.

947
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:13,563
- So I didn't stay, so what?

948
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:16,466
- You just about got yourself
 skewered in there, me too.

949
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:18,067
- Yeah.

950
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:19,502
I sort of thought I
  talked to you about that.

951
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:21,337
Harry, that guy with a crucifix

952
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:23,139
really thinks you're a vampire.

953
00:57:23,139 --> 00:57:24,441
- Yeah, he really does.

954
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,341
What do you think?

955
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:27,744
- Well, of course
 I don't think that.

956
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:29,579
There's no such
  thing as vampires.

957
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:31,781
- Good, then we can drop it.

958
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,116
- Who are you, Harry?

959
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,417
Who the hell are you?

960
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:36,319
What are you involved in?

961
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:37,821
What is it your family does?

962
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:39,622
What, are they horse thieves,
 are they a crime syndicate?

963
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:40,456
What?

964
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:44,794
What's behind all of those
  dark Carpathian eyes?

965
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:47,530
And what are all
 these damn secrets?

966
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:50,834
- That's exactly what
  they are, damned secrets.

967
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:53,002
Now please can you back off?

968
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:54,637
- Yeah, I can back off.

969
00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:57,907
I can back way off.

970
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,578
I'll see you in court, Harry.

971
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:04,380
Sometime.

972
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:09,853
(slow music)

973
00:58:17,126 --> 00:58:19,729
(upbeat music)

974
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:39,916
- Oh, I don't think so, Butch.

975
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:40,917
- Don't you feel it?

976
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:43,987
It wants to belong to you.

977
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,956
You need this horse, Cody.

978
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:49,092
Your life depends on it.

979
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:51,427
It's gonna take you
 so fast and so far

980
00:58:51,427 --> 00:58:54,430
that none of them,
  no cops of them,

981
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,434
no hunters of them, will
  ever be able to touch you.

982
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:04,874
(engine starts)

983
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,676
(cheering)

984
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:08,278
- [Man] Yeah, Cody!

985
00:59:09,312 --> 00:59:10,647
- Alright, Cody.

986
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:12,415
Out of the chute!

987
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:15,852
- Whoa!

988
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:22,492
(shouting)

989
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:24,661
(smashes)

990
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:40,643
- It's what we've got
 coming to us, Cody.

991
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:42,445
And it's what they're
 out there for.

992
00:59:44,814 --> 00:59:48,451
Working, spinning,
 grazing, fattening.

993
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:54,357
And their only purpose in
  this life is to be there

994
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:56,592
for us to feed off.

995
00:59:56,592 --> 00:59:58,695
(laughs)

996
00:59:59,595 --> 01:00:00,430
You see?

997
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:04,300
(slow music)

998
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:49,946
- Celia?

999
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:52,949
Celia, are you there?

1000
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:08,031
(ominous music)

1001
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:09,298
Oh no.

1002
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:11,968
Celia, turn back.

1003
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:21,444
(screaming)

1004
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:22,278
Celia!

1005
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:26,549
Celia!

1006
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:29,318
Celia!

1007
01:01:31,687 --> 01:01:33,856
(smashes)

1008
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:43,866
Harry.

1009
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:47,804
Harry.

1010
01:01:47,804 --> 01:01:50,106
Get her back, please.

1011
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:51,474
I'll do anything.

1012
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:52,575
I'll give you anything!

1013
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:56,212
Look, I'm sorry I called you
 a damned assimilationist.

1014
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:58,147
- Look, I've got this tape.

1015
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:00,416
It may give us some idea
of what they're up to.

1016
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:04,387
- You know, it's
  your fault, Harry.

1017
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:07,023
It's all your damned
 fault she was taken.

1018
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:08,491
You're the one who
 tells her it's alright

1019
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:09,692
to go off on her own.

1020
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,929
You think I don't know
who she goes out to see?

1021
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:15,331
Think I don't recognize
your mark on her throat?

1022
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:18,101
- Eli, Harry has something
  he wants to show us.

1023
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:20,403
- If anything
 happens to my sister,

1024
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,772
I'm coming after you, Harlevon.

1025
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:24,440
- Nothing is gonna
  happen to Celia.

1026
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,642
She's not who they
  want, she's bait.

1027
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,245
Now come here and watch this.

1028
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,013
I care about her
  as much as you do.

1029
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:35,885
(audience laughs)

1030
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:36,752
- Let me go.

1031
01:02:36,752 --> 01:02:38,754
(gasps)

1032
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:41,924
We know who you are,
 we know where you are.

1033
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:43,392
Don't make us come to you.

1034
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:44,827
We will meet with you.

1035
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:48,731
The hour of the jackal
 at the false Elysium.

1036
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:52,301
We will have something
 that you want.

1037
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:53,970
At the false Elysium.

1038
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:57,740
Hour of the jackal
 at the false Elysium!

1039
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:00,843
- That's it alright.

1040
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:05,448
They've thrown
  down the gauntlet.

1041
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:06,349
- What's going on?

1042
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:10,520
- The hunters have
 put out a challenge.

1043
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,054
They know that we'll
 come after Celia.

1044
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:15,825
It's kind of a traditional
  thing, you know?

1045
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:19,095
Back in the old country,
 they say it used to get ugly.

1046
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:24,634
- Tonight, the
 hour of the jackal.

1047
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:25,935
- 3:00 a.m.

1048
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:27,837
- Question is where.

1049
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:29,972
- Why don't they just say where?

1050
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:30,807
- Elysium.

1051
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:34,443
- Just always been done
like that with ciphers

1052
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:35,278
and cryptograms.

1053
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:37,446
- Paradise.

1054
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:41,184
Nirvana, utopia.

1055
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:42,051
Zion.

1056
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:50,793
Xanadu.

1057
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:55,631
False Elysium.

1058
01:03:58,301 --> 01:04:01,304
- Let's make ourselves ready.

1059
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:03,439
- Come on.

1060
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:06,976
- Cody.

1061
01:04:09,078 --> 01:04:09,912
Come with me.

1062
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,682
I want to show you someplace.

1063
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:29,799
You don't feel the
 pull of this place?

1064
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:32,835
- [Cody] A little spooky maybe.

1065
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:34,704
- Your mom and dad
  were married here,

1066
01:04:35,805 --> 01:04:36,973
under the stars.

1067
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:39,375
- Is that so?

1068
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:41,978
- I stood right about there.

1069
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:43,980
I was 11 years old.

1070
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:49,018
And they weren't much more
 than kids themselves, really.

1071
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:53,289
They were giggling, kneeling
 in front of the priest,

1072
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:56,058
exchanging glances while
the old man prayed.

1073
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,629
- You want to spare me
  the trip down memory lane?

1074
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:00,763
Butch is waiting for me.

1075
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:03,099
- Okay.

1076
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:04,433
Then we'll cut right to it.

1077
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:07,603
Your folks left this place

1078
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:11,007
because they wanted a different
kind of life for you, Cody.

1079
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:12,642
One where everything
  didn't have to be settled

1080
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:14,010
in the old ways.

1081
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:16,178
- And what did they find, Harry?

1082
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:17,780
Humanity?

1083
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:20,283
And what was it that drove
wooden spikes into their hearts,

1084
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:22,018
human kindness?

1085
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:23,653
And am I supposed to
 forgive these people?

1086
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:24,887
- No.

1087
01:05:24,887 --> 01:05:26,222
- Then why shouldn't
 I kill them back?

1088
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:29,558
- I'm not sure, Cody.

1089
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:32,194
I'm not there myself yet.

1090
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:34,964
- Then could we get out of here?

1091
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:39,101
I've got some things
 to take care of

1092
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:41,003
before the hour of the jackal.

1093
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:50,680
(sighs)

1094
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:53,816
- Yeah, so do I.

1095
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,189
(slow music)

1096
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:25,114
(doorbell rings)

1097
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:45,334
I don't care what anybody says.

1098
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:49,071
I just had to see you one
  more time, just in case.

1099
01:06:55,378 --> 01:06:57,546
(kissing)

1100
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:15,030
- Where you been, vamp?

1101
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:16,265
- Been out riding around.

1102
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:18,534
Thinking about stuff.

1103
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:20,503
- Well, get off that.

1104
01:07:21,737 --> 01:07:24,206
We're taking the
 attack bikes tonight.

1105
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:38,421
(growling)

1106
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:19,094
(kissing)

1107
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,895
(pops)

1108
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:08,711
(pops)

1109
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:34,937
(laughs)

1110
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:37,339
(hisses)

1111
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:40,009
(screams)

1112
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,077
(growls)

1113
01:09:57,359 --> 01:09:59,862
(smacks)

1114
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:02,031
(moaning)

1115
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:25,621
(growls)

1116
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:39,401
(slow music)

1117
01:11:05,894 --> 01:11:08,631
(dramatic music)

1118
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:22,578
- Yeah.

1119
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:42,765
(fire crackling)

1120
01:11:57,012 --> 01:11:59,148
(screams)

1121
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:09,224
- Celia!

1122
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:11,293
- [Vasile] Alright, alright.

1123
01:12:11,293 --> 01:12:12,394
- It's an ambush, Eli.

1124
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:14,296
Don't fly into it.

1125
01:12:15,364 --> 01:12:16,999
- Celia!

1126
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:17,933
- Let's go.

1127
01:12:23,072 --> 01:12:25,274
(shouting)

1128
01:12:25,274 --> 01:12:26,542
- Destroy them!

1129
01:12:30,913 --> 01:12:33,015
(grunts)

1130
01:12:46,562 --> 01:12:49,064
- [Man] Kill the bloodsuckers!

1131
01:12:58,974 --> 01:13:01,043
(screams)

1132
01:13:02,978 --> 01:13:03,812
- Celia!

1133
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:10,319
- [Man] Send 'em back to hell!

1134
01:13:14,823 --> 01:13:16,925
(grunts)

1135
01:13:25,968 --> 01:13:28,203
(shouting)

1136
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:48,524
- Yeah, come on, let's go!

1137
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:09,845
(clangs)

1138
01:14:21,924 --> 01:14:22,758
- Celia!

1139
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:26,061
Celia!

1140
01:14:32,568 --> 01:14:34,136
(grunts)

1141
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:34,970
Celia.

1142
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:09,271
- Harlevon, here!

1143
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:31,593
- Here.

1144
01:15:31,593 --> 01:15:32,427
- Harry!

1145
01:15:43,438 --> 01:15:46,275
(engines revving)

1146
01:15:56,485 --> 01:15:58,654
(crashes)

1147
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:10,566
(slow music)

1148
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:29,518
(grunts)

1149
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:37,125
- No, son.

1150
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:38,760
They have to answer
 to all of us.

1151
01:16:47,703 --> 01:16:48,537
Earth.

1152
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:58,347
Carpathian earth?

1153
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:04,553
Harlevon, you have something
 to say before we rule?

1154
01:17:05,721 --> 01:17:07,689
- These people are not
 for us to deal with.

1155
01:17:08,657 --> 01:17:11,159
They belong to the Texas courts.

1156
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:13,962
- Give me a damn break, Harry.

1157
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:15,964
Texas courts will
  turn them loose

1158
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:18,633
before you can say
 kiss my habeas corpus.

1159
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:22,404
They'll be back, by the busload,

1160
01:17:23,672 --> 01:17:27,542
singing hymns,
  sharpening fence pickets.

1161
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:28,377
Right?

1162
01:17:29,411 --> 01:17:30,345
- Count on it.

1163
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:35,350
- They want us to do
this, can't you see it?

1164
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:39,888
They don't care what
price they have to pay.

1165
01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:42,824
It makes us what
they say we are.

1166
01:17:43,959 --> 01:17:47,663
And that justifies
  the slaughter.

1167
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:50,332
- Slaughter justifies slaughter.

1168
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:51,400
They invented it!

1169
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:54,736
They invested in it.

1170
01:17:54,736 --> 01:17:56,405
Now these notes are coming due.

1171
01:17:57,806 --> 01:17:59,241
They owe this boy.

1172
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:01,877
They owe his parents!

1173
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:05,280
- And we owe him reason.

1174
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,155
- It's time.

1175
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:20,629
Harry?

1176
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:25,467
- You know how I feel.

1177
01:18:34,576 --> 01:18:37,312
(dramatic music)

1178
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:03,138
(growling)

1179
01:19:03,138 --> 01:19:05,474
(screaming)

1180
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:28,463
Cody.

1181
01:19:28,463 --> 01:19:30,265
This is not what your
parents wanted for you.

1182
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:32,601
This is why they left.

1183
01:19:57,092 --> 01:19:59,528
(slow music)

1184
01:20:31,026 --> 01:20:33,295
(shouting)

1185
01:20:43,205 --> 01:20:45,774
(gentle music)

1186
01:21:20,075 --> 01:21:22,744
(alarm beeping)

1187
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:43,898
(buttons clicking)

1188
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:51,339
(sighs)

1189
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:52,173
That's me.

1190
01:21:55,176 --> 01:21:56,678
Right, Marv, I'm on it.

1191
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:02,550
(kissing)

1192
01:22:05,854 --> 01:22:09,157
Those guys, the vampire hunters?

1193
01:22:09,157 --> 01:22:09,991
They found them.

1194
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:14,429
Dead, washed up on a beach.

1195
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:15,263
I gotta cover it.

1196
01:22:16,665 --> 01:22:18,833
(kissing)

1197
01:22:30,645 --> 01:22:35,417
- It's a good thing someone
knew where you were last night.

1198
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:36,484
- Good thing.

1199
01:22:39,854 --> 01:22:41,856
(moans)

1200
01:22:51,366 --> 01:22:54,135
(dramatic music)
