1
00:01:53,544 --> 00:01:55,878
Yeah, hello. You're Steve?

2
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,893
Steven. Hi.

3
00:01:57,991 --> 00:02:00,030
- Sit down.
- Roberto?

4
00:02:04,678 --> 00:02:06,565
- I'm all wound up.
- Yeah.

5
00:02:06,758 --> 00:02:09,692
You're wound up? I'm wound up, too.

6
00:02:10,502 --> 00:02:12,160
- Yes.
- All wound up.

7
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,964
- What are you drinking? Coffee?
- Coffee, yes.

8
00:02:16,037 --> 00:02:18,208
- Very good for me. For you?
- I love coffee.

9
00:02:18,277 --> 00:02:19,585
- You love it, too?
- I love it.

10
00:02:19,653 --> 00:02:21,114
- Steve.
- Steven.

11
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:24,761
I love coffee.

12
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:27,130
What do you do?

13
00:02:27,749 --> 00:02:31,294
You know, I just relax, sit around,
maybe have a cigarette.

14
00:02:31,845 --> 00:02:34,397
Cigarettes and coffee
I think go together good.

15
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,834
You think you drink too much of it?

16
00:02:36,899 --> 00:02:39,386
No. Coffee is good for health.

17
00:02:40,068 --> 00:02:41,890
I like to drink before I go to sleep.

18
00:02:41,955 --> 00:02:45,020
I drink a lot of coffee before I go to sleep
so I can dream faster.

19
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:47,643
I can dream like when they put a camera
on the Indy 500...

20
00:02:47,714 --> 00:02:50,975
when they put a camera in the car,
and it's just whipping by like that.

21
00:02:51,043 --> 00:02:53,050
Dream after dream after dream after dream.

22
00:02:53,122 --> 00:02:55,510
People ask me the next day,
"What did you dream about?"

23
00:02:55,587 --> 00:02:59,164
I say, "I don't have time.
I don't have time to tell you this."

24
00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:08,763
- Do you smoke?
- Only when I drink coffee.

25
00:03:09,921 --> 00:03:11,709
Do you know my mother?

26
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:15,414
- Do I know your mother?
- Yeah.

27
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:17,692
I don't know. I don't think so.

28
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:21,629
- Coffee. They should freeze it, you know?
- Yes.

29
00:03:21,696 --> 00:03:25,208
Fill an ice-cube tray with coffee
and put sticks in it, for kids.

30
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,443
So they can start when they're kids,
when they're playing and stuff.

31
00:03:28,512 --> 00:03:31,097
Like a Popsicle. A caffeine Popsicle.

32
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:33,948
Very good. I don't understand nothing. Yes.

33
00:03:49,566 --> 00:03:51,388
- Can you hear me?
- What?

34
00:03:51,454 --> 00:03:53,276
Can you hear me? It's very loud over here.

35
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:56,636
You having trouble hearing me?
Maybe we should switch.

36
00:03:57,405 --> 00:04:00,852
Yes, thank you very much. I'd like to switch.

37
00:04:04,093 --> 00:04:05,369
Good here.

38
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:14,390
- Good?
- I kind of liked it better over there.

39
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,434
- You go...
- Do you mind?

40
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,539
Yes, me, too. I prefer, yes.

41
00:04:25,051 --> 00:04:26,359
Steve, yes.

42
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,530
- When do you leave?
- The United States?

43
00:04:40,634 --> 00:04:41,811
No, here.

44
00:04:41,978 --> 00:04:45,807
I have to leave soon, actually.
I have a dentist appointment.

45
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:51,058
But I don't want to go.
I don't like the dentist.

46
00:04:53,816 --> 00:04:55,506
I gotta go, I guess.

47
00:04:56,153 --> 00:04:58,389
- Yes.
- I haven't gone in a while.

48
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:01,871
Good. You don't go?

49
00:05:03,224 --> 00:05:06,704
- I should go, but I don't feel like going.
- No?

50
00:05:11,095 --> 00:05:13,811
I am free, very free.

51
00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:16,849
You wanna go for me?

52
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,544
Thank you very much.

53
00:05:18,615 --> 00:05:20,916
- You wanna go to the dentist?
- Yes, I can go for you.

54
00:05:20,983 --> 00:05:22,095
Great.

55
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:24,940
- Here's the address.
- Good.

56
00:05:26,135 --> 00:05:27,214
Good. Very good.

57
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,390
- The name of the guy.
- Yeah, 4:30.

58
00:05:30,486 --> 00:05:33,747
- Steven, thank you very much.
- No problem.

59
00:05:33,877 --> 00:05:35,916
- You don't mind?
- No, thank you.

60
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,193
Dentist appointment, very good.

61
00:05:40,213 --> 00:05:42,384
I have to go. I am sorry, Steve.

62
00:05:43,157 --> 00:05:46,190
Steve, I have to go to the dentist. I am late.

63
00:05:46,485 --> 00:05:50,030
- Thank you, excuse me. Sorry.
- Take it easy, don't be late.

64
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,511
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too, in a way.

65
00:06:37,713 --> 00:06:40,134
What are we doing in Memphis, anyway?

66
00:06:40,657 --> 00:06:42,511
- It was your idea to come here.
- Your idea.

67
00:06:42,577 --> 00:06:44,911
It was my idea? It was your idea.

68
00:06:52,591 --> 00:06:53,899
Very funny.

69
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:03,340
Don't smoke those sawdust cigarettes
in here.

70
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:04,932
I hate those things.

71
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,916
- So what?
- What are you, a cowboy?

72
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,437
- These are fresh. This is fresh tobacco.
- No, this is fresh.

73
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:14,982
- This is the stupid dope fresh cigarettes.
- That stuff is stale. What are you, crazy?

74
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:18,315
- I'm not crazy.
- Shut up.

75
00:07:22,637 --> 00:07:24,611
How we doing here? Need a refill?

76
00:07:24,717 --> 00:07:25,993
- Yeah.
- No.

77
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,264
- Sir?
- Yes.

78
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,860
Shit. I'm sorry.

79
00:07:38,508 --> 00:07:42,249
- Come on, what are you doing, man?
- Damn, I'm sorry about that.

80
00:07:42,827 --> 00:07:46,055
Let's not even pay the check.
This place is terrible.

81
00:07:46,891 --> 00:07:49,029
This all you're gonna have?

82
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:51,400
- Give me a light.
- Just coffee and cigarettes?

83
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:53,386
That's not too healthy, is it now?

84
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:56,232
- Can I get you a sandwich or something?
- No.

85
00:07:56,682 --> 00:07:58,820
- Y'all from around here?
- No.

86
00:08:00,042 --> 00:08:01,470
Are you brother and sister?

87
00:08:01,546 --> 00:08:02,756
- Yes.
- No.

88
00:08:05,097 --> 00:08:06,438
Are you two twins?

89
00:08:06,505 --> 00:08:07,715
- Yes.
- No.

90
00:08:07,977 --> 00:08:09,285
Yes, we are.

91
00:08:09,674 --> 00:08:12,641
I thought so.
You know who y'all remind me of?

92
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:14,696
- Who?
- Heckle and Jeckle.

93
00:08:16,104 --> 00:08:17,151
Shit.

94
00:08:17,672 --> 00:08:20,322
You know, the talking magpies?

95
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,145
Anyway, who's the evil twin?
That's the way it works, right?

96
00:08:27,623 --> 00:08:30,110
- This coffee tastes like mud.
- Really.

97
00:08:32,168 --> 00:08:35,396
Which one of us do you think
looks like the evil one?

98
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:38,974
I'd say he's the evil one, right?
He's got the evil eye.

99
00:08:40,903 --> 00:08:43,204
- I'm only kidding.
- You better be.

100
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:47,228
You know, I just thought of something,
with you two being twins and all.

101
00:08:47,302 --> 00:08:49,723
- Did y'all go to Graceland yet?
- No.

102
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,489
You should. It's real cool.

103
00:08:51,558 --> 00:08:53,859
- Mind if I sit down?
- Yes, I do.

104
00:08:54,022 --> 00:08:56,956
Yes, you can sit down.
What are you, on a break?

105
00:08:57,478 --> 00:09:00,826
Not really, but it's kind of slow.
Tell you what, you can help me out.

106
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:04,893
Just stay right there. You got me covered
and my boss can't see me.

107
00:09:06,405 --> 00:09:08,444
It's his evil nature, right?

108
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,231
Anyway, what I just thought of:

109
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:14,235
Do you know that
Elvis Presley's got a twin brother?

110
00:09:14,308 --> 00:09:18,049
Yeah, his name is Jesse Garon.
You know, Elvis' middle name is Aaron.

111
00:09:18,116 --> 00:09:21,977
Aaron, Garon. Anyway,
everybody thinks that he died at birth.

112
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:23,709
But my theory is...

113
00:09:23,811 --> 00:09:27,159
that his mother didn't wanna raise two kids.
She wasn't expecting twins.

114
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,601
She couldn't afford to raise both.
She gave one away.

115
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:34,009
She just sent one off. So Jesse grew up
in Arkansas, or Mississippi, or something.

116
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:37,758
So he didn't know he had a brother, Elvis.
But one day, like, 1968 or '69...

117
00:09:37,826 --> 00:09:41,273
he's looking at himself in the mirror
and says, "Damn, I look like Elvis."

118
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:43,931
So he comes to Memphis, looks up Elvis.

119
00:09:44,002 --> 00:09:47,350
Elvis sees him, he says,
"Yeah, you're my brother. I can't believe it!

120
00:09:47,426 --> 00:09:49,978
"How you doing? What can I do for you?"

121
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:52,699
And his brother says, "Well, I don't know.

122
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:55,583
"Sure would be nice
to be you for one night."

123
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:59,294
So Elvis had this concert
where his brother sang.

124
00:09:59,393 --> 00:10:04,029
They tried to see if they could trick people.
Damn if he didn't sound like his brother!

125
00:10:04,256 --> 00:10:06,011
Then Elvis had an idea.

126
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,949
"I'm tired of the music scene.
I'll send him out on tour."

127
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:12,600
Big mistake, because it was his brother
who started to go to Vegas...

128
00:10:12,671 --> 00:10:16,216
and wear them big collars,
the white jumpsuits, and the capes.

129
00:10:16,288 --> 00:10:19,768
Elvis wouldn't do that.
And it was his brother who got really fat.

130
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,450
You know, eating those
banana-fried butter sandwiches and all.

131
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,096
The Colonel said, "We gotta get rid
of this guy. He can't be Elvis anymore."

132
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:30,678
So they started feeding him pills.
I think they killed him.

133
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,673
So what? What are you saying?
What's the punch line?

134
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:40,628
- Y'all are Elvis fans?
- No.

135
00:10:43,485 --> 00:10:46,833
You wanna hear something about Elvis?
I'll tell you something about him.

136
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:49,778
- You ever heard of Otis Blackwell?
- No, ma'am.

137
00:10:49,885 --> 00:10:52,699
- You ever heard of Junior Parker?
- No, ma'am.

138
00:10:52,957 --> 00:10:56,437
Yeah, I didn't think so.
You know, Elvis robbed their music, man.

139
00:10:56,509 --> 00:11:00,763
He paid them $10 for their music,
and all these other black musicians, too.

140
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:03,697
- That's what I think of Elvis.
- Here's where my theory fits.

141
00:11:03,772 --> 00:11:06,641
I don't think it was Elvis.
I think it was his brother.

142
00:11:06,747 --> 00:11:08,885
So in that case, it's all right?

143
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:14,968
My favorite Elvis quote is, "The only thing
colors can do for me is shine my shoes."

144
00:11:16,378 --> 00:11:20,272
I don't think the King said that.
See, I think it was his evil twin.

145
00:11:21,754 --> 00:11:25,299
Danny, what you doing over there?
You got tables to wait on. Come on.

146
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,119
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah, don't get fired, man.

147
00:11:29,402 --> 00:11:31,092
Slaphappy hillbilly.

148
00:11:31,962 --> 00:11:33,107
Cheers.

149
00:11:36,441 --> 00:11:38,644
Something smells funny in here.

150
00:11:43,897 --> 00:11:45,936
Is that my shirt you got on?

151
00:11:48,536 --> 00:11:49,746
No, I don't think so.

152
00:11:49,816 --> 00:11:52,237
Yeah, I think it is.
This doesn't smell like me.

153
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:53,555
Yeah? What do you smell like?

154
00:11:53,624 --> 00:11:55,728
I smell like me,
and this doesn't smell like me.

155
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,580
- I smell like me, too.
- But this smells like you.

156
00:11:58,648 --> 00:12:00,470
That's because I am me.

157
00:12:01,335 --> 00:12:02,796
Is that my shirt?

158
00:12:02,871 --> 00:12:05,391
- Why you always copying me, anyway?
- I'm not copying you.

159
00:12:05,463 --> 00:12:07,950
- Why don't you get your own style?
- I have my own style.

160
00:12:08,054 --> 00:12:11,534
No, you're always copying me.
Your style is my style because you copy it.

161
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:13,743
- It's my style.
- No, it's not your style.

162
00:12:13,814 --> 00:12:16,497
Service is bad, the coffee is bad,
the music sucks.

163
00:12:16,566 --> 00:12:17,613
Those are my shoes.

164
00:12:17,686 --> 00:12:19,409
- These are my shoes.
- Those are my shoes.

165
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:21,484
- These are my shoes.
- Those are my other shoes.

166
00:12:21,557 --> 00:12:22,505
Bullshit.

167
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:12,074
- Hey.
- Hey, Tom.

168
00:13:12,369 --> 00:13:14,757
- All right.
- I'm glad you could make it.

169
00:13:15,665 --> 00:13:17,093
You are here.

170
00:13:18,321 --> 00:13:20,208
You know, you can call me Jim.

171
00:13:20,273 --> 00:13:24,233
I mean, you know, my friends call me Jim,
or Jimmy, or lggy, or Jiggy.

172
00:13:24,593 --> 00:13:26,054
Call me lggy.

173
00:13:27,569 --> 00:13:31,562
Okay, all right, whichever way you go.
I'll go either way, Jim or lggy...

174
00:13:31,632 --> 00:13:33,639
You call me lggy.

175
00:13:34,095 --> 00:13:38,349
Look, I'm sorry I'm late, Jim.
Boy, four-car pileup.

176
00:13:40,304 --> 00:13:42,475
I delivered a baby this morning
at about 9:00.

177
00:13:42,575 --> 00:13:46,251
I was saving lives,
I was out there on the highway, it was...

178
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,322
You know, there's nothing worse
than roadside surgery.

179
00:13:49,391 --> 00:13:52,968
You don't have your own tools,
and it's just... It's murder.

180
00:13:53,614 --> 00:13:56,909
I performed a tracheotomy
with a ballpoint pen and...

181
00:13:58,926 --> 00:14:00,387
I've been busy.

182
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,582
Wait a minute. You're a doctor?

183
00:14:06,157 --> 00:14:08,328
Yeah, I'm a doctor.

184
00:14:10,413 --> 00:14:13,227
Music and medicine, really.
It's really been my thing.

185
00:14:13,293 --> 00:14:17,667
It's combining the two
and living in that place where they overlap.

186
00:14:19,116 --> 00:14:22,760
A lot of people say it shows up in the music.
I don't know. I mean, it's...

187
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,893
Well, okay. Yeah, I can see that.

188
00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:31,269
Yeah, okay. I think the organization
and the whole thing...

189
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:32,647
- The humanity, I guess.
- Yeah.

190
00:14:32,715 --> 00:14:37,253
- The humanity of the thing. The regard.
- Yeah, the regard.

191
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:42,055
- I guess it's a big day for you, then.
- It is. It was a medical morning.

192
00:14:42,122 --> 00:14:44,707
- Everybody's all right?
- Everybody's fine.

193
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:48,872
You've been here awhile, I see.

194
00:14:48,938 --> 00:14:51,621
I've been here. Drinking a little coffee.

195
00:14:51,753 --> 00:14:54,054
- Yeah, I see.
- I ordered you some.

196
00:14:56,425 --> 00:14:58,083
You ordered for me?

197
00:14:59,145 --> 00:15:01,446
I mean, is it cool? Is that cool?

198
00:15:01,993 --> 00:15:04,513
Yeah, okay. Coffee, yeah.

199
00:15:06,025 --> 00:15:08,261
- I could go for a coffee.
- Okay, man.

200
00:15:08,584 --> 00:15:10,471
Come on, have some coffee.

201
00:15:12,808 --> 00:15:14,466
Okay, coffee it is.

202
00:15:34,694 --> 00:15:36,155
Are those your cigarettes?

203
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,197
No, they were just sitting here
when I got here.

204
00:15:39,942 --> 00:15:42,527
- You don't smoke, do you?
- No. I gave it up.

205
00:15:42,598 --> 00:15:44,386
- Not for me, either.
- Boy, enough of that.

206
00:15:44,453 --> 00:15:46,557
That was enough, 25 big ones.

207
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:50,337
- Finished.
- Got the energy now.

208
00:15:52,324 --> 00:15:55,552
Since I quit, I mean, just everything...

209
00:15:56,549 --> 00:15:57,726
Yeah, you're focused.

210
00:15:57,796 --> 00:16:00,512
- Zeroed in. Bang, you know?
- Me, too.

211
00:16:01,092 --> 00:16:05,346
I feel sorry for suckers still puffing away,
you know?

212
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:08,186
- No willpower.
- No willpower. Pacifier.

213
00:16:09,028 --> 00:16:10,140
Silly.

214
00:16:11,811 --> 00:16:16,317
You know, the beauty of quitting is,
now that I've quit...

215
00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:20,669
I can have one. Because I've quit.

216
00:16:23,587 --> 00:16:25,626
I mean, it's just like jewelry.

217
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,210
You know, it's not really...
I don't even inhale.

218
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,559
You want to join me in one?

219
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:36,633
Yeah, since I quit. Okay.

220
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:39,355
- Now that you've quit, you can have one.
- Sure, yeah.

221
00:16:39,425 --> 00:16:41,366
I can do that. All right.

222
00:16:49,632 --> 00:16:51,322
Boy, thank you.

223
00:16:51,392 --> 00:16:55,188
Yeah, you know what I mean?
Now that we've quit...

224
00:17:00,576 --> 00:17:04,121
Cigarettes and coffee, man.
That's a combination.

225
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,547
Can't beat it.

226
00:17:09,183 --> 00:17:13,492
We're really the coffee-and-cigarettes
generation, when you think about it.

227
00:17:14,815 --> 00:17:18,808
You know what I mean? In the '40s,
it was the pie-and-coffee generation.

228
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:23,511
Like Abbott and Costello on TV, man.
They always wanted pie and coffee.

229
00:17:24,254 --> 00:17:28,115
Yeah, like Abbott and Costello.
They were always ordering pie and coffee.

230
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:30,260
"Have some coffee.
Have some pie and coffee.

231
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:32,469
"What are you waiting for?"

232
00:17:38,365 --> 00:17:40,252
You hang out here a lot?

233
00:17:43,836 --> 00:17:45,526
This is my hangout.

234
00:17:46,459 --> 00:17:50,517
I just wondered, 'cause I didn't see
anything of yours on the jukebox.

235
00:17:56,347 --> 00:18:00,274
If you don't like it here, we could
go down to Taco Bell or something.

236
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,386
Maybe that's more your style.

237
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:08,308
What are you saying, man?
You're saying I'm a Taco Bell kind of guy?

238
00:18:08,762 --> 00:18:11,631
No. I mean, if you don't like it here.

239
00:18:11,962 --> 00:18:15,093
- You said you don't like it here.
- No, I didn't say that.

240
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:17,364
We could go to
the International House of Pancakes.

241
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:19,407
Maybe that's more up your alley.
I don't know.

242
00:18:19,481 --> 00:18:23,310
I didn't say that. I don't wanna go
to the International House of Pancakes.

243
00:18:23,384 --> 00:18:24,910
I'm comfortable.

244
00:18:34,008 --> 00:18:35,949
Coffee is good, though, at IHOP.

245
00:18:36,056 --> 00:18:38,641
You like the coffee down there at IHOP?

246
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:46,613
I drink the coffee at IHOP.
I like the coffee. You don't like it?

247
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:50,061
Yeah, man. I like the IHOP coffee.

248
00:18:50,455 --> 00:18:53,389
- Classy brew.
- Yeah, that's good coffee.

249
00:18:56,086 --> 00:18:58,573
Yeah, that's good coffee at the IHOP.

250
00:19:06,422 --> 00:19:08,309
I almost forgot. Listen.

251
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:11,661
I worked with this drummer
the other day in LA.

252
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,864
And this guy, man, his name is Giant Robo.

253
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:19,665
He was clanging and banging really hard.
Man, I thought of you.

254
00:19:19,732 --> 00:19:20,844
Maybe you want to...

255
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:24,145
This is somebody,
I think you ought to check him out.

256
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,685
You mean,
you think I need a professional drummer?

257
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,670
I'm not good enough?

258
00:19:31,988 --> 00:19:33,394
What are you talking about?

259
00:19:33,491 --> 00:19:36,839
No, but I'm just...
You know, it's a musician.

260
00:19:36,947 --> 00:19:40,907
I thought... I just wanted to tell you
about this guy. It'd be great, man.

261
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:45,517
It's hard and industrial, and he's beating,
and I just thought, "Wow."

262
00:19:49,746 --> 00:19:52,779
What are you trying to tell me?
I need a drummer?

263
00:19:53,586 --> 00:19:55,374
I could use a drummer?

264
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:59,597
The drumming on my records sucks?
What are you saying?

265
00:20:05,744 --> 00:20:07,205
Forget it, man.

266
00:20:37,806 --> 00:20:39,212
You know what?

267
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,629
- I think I really got to get going.
- You got to go?

268
00:20:42,734 --> 00:20:44,872
Maybe another cup?
Maybe another cigarette...

269
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:46,502
Boy, I'd like to.

270
00:20:47,054 --> 00:20:50,763
No. I really gotta go. I mean...

271
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:56,551
My wife, she's alone in a motel.

272
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,099
Maybe we could call her up,
come on down here.

273
00:21:00,172 --> 00:21:03,139
Have a cup of coffee
and a couple of cigarettes.

274
00:21:04,108 --> 00:21:07,490
She doesn't smoke.
You know, it's the willpower.

275
00:21:07,564 --> 00:21:09,418
- I see.
- I don't want to start her.

276
00:21:09,515 --> 00:21:11,783
No, you don't want to get her started.

277
00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:14,889
- This is our little thing here.
- Yeah, right.

278
00:21:15,147 --> 00:21:17,863
But we can just sort of...

279
00:21:18,699 --> 00:21:21,065
We can just keep zipping along, you know.

280
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,017
I'll be thinking of you.

281
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:26,473
- Gotta go.
- I guess so.

282
00:21:28,202 --> 00:21:30,503
- See you soon.
- Yeah, okay.

283
00:21:31,818 --> 00:21:34,338
I wish you could stay a little longer.

284
00:21:36,137 --> 00:21:39,519
- We were just starting to get going here.
- Gotta go.

285
00:21:43,753 --> 00:21:45,029
Okay, Jim.

286
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,327
- Next time.
- Okay, next time.

287
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,991
- You take care.
- You take care, too.

288
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:15,653
He's not on here, either.

289
00:23:13,442 --> 00:23:16,441
- You're a fucking moron, you know that?
- Now what?

290
00:23:17,154 --> 00:23:20,317
I can't believe that
you're still smoking those fucking things.

291
00:23:20,417 --> 00:23:22,391
Vinny, they'll fuck you up.

292
00:23:22,626 --> 00:23:24,764
They'll kill you. Believe me.

293
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,028
Were you put on this fucking earth
to annoy me?

294
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:29,918
You said you were gonna quit.

295
00:23:29,985 --> 00:23:32,373
Instead, you spend a fortune...

296
00:23:32,448 --> 00:23:35,579
so those big tobacco companies
can get fucking rich.

297
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:37,208
And then you get cancer.

298
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,174
And then the fucking doctors
and the hospitals, they can get rich.

299
00:23:41,248 --> 00:23:43,102
And the undertakers, too.

300
00:23:43,168 --> 00:23:45,371
All because you want to smoke
like a fucking moron.

301
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:48,188
I can't help it. I'm fucking addicted, okay?

302
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:50,420
So, coffee and cigarettes?

303
00:23:50,943 --> 00:23:54,074
That's your lunch? That ain't healthy, is it?

304
00:23:54,143 --> 00:23:56,695
You're drinking coffee,
so don't break my fucking balls.

305
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:59,254
Vinny, I had lunch already.

306
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,493
So I'm on a diet, okay? Jesus!

307
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:09,075
Here comes my freaking kid.

308
00:24:17,277 --> 00:24:20,124
Do me a favor.
Don't tell your mother, please.

309
00:24:20,188 --> 00:24:24,115
What the fuck am I talking about?
She smokes like a locomotive, anyway.

310
00:24:24,765 --> 00:24:26,553
How you doing, Junior?

311
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,743
- He don't talk much, does he?
- Not lately.

312
00:24:31,132 --> 00:24:33,433
Lately he's been the silent type.

313
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:37,978
I gave you $10 last night.
So what did you do with it?

314
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,893
I just gave you $5.

315
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,453
Listen, I'll give you $1 more. That's it.

316
00:24:55,674 --> 00:24:59,056
Can I at least get a hug?
For $6, can I get a freaking hug?

317
00:24:59,674 --> 00:25:01,080
$10 for a hug?

318
00:25:01,273 --> 00:25:05,266
You gotta be out of your freaking mind.
All right, come here. I'll give you.

319
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:10,256
You better go get yourself something to eat,
and something good.

320
00:25:10,329 --> 00:25:13,841
Yeah, just like him.
Get some coffee and cigarettes.

321
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,498
Oh, brother!
What the fuck are you talking about?

322
00:25:16,568 --> 00:25:18,258
Look how much coffee you're drinking.

323
00:25:18,328 --> 00:25:20,466
You got the whole fucking pot
over there with you.

324
00:25:20,536 --> 00:25:23,219
So what? They always bring me a whole pot.

325
00:25:23,416 --> 00:25:25,717
I like coffee. Keeps me going.

326
00:25:26,007 --> 00:25:29,934
It keeps you going, all right.
You're a fucking maniac. A caffeine maniac.

327
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:31,926
- You're drinking coffee, ain't you?
- Yeah.

328
00:25:31,991 --> 00:25:34,478
- So?
- So maybe you should try to quit.

329
00:25:37,015 --> 00:25:39,764
- I ain't no fucking quitter.
- I'll drink to that.

330
00:25:48,181 --> 00:25:49,609
Fucking moron.

331
00:25:50,165 --> 00:25:52,303
Shit, here comes my kid again.

332
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:58,003
How much did you spend?

333
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,229
And that's all you got for $4?

334
00:26:02,036 --> 00:26:04,402
Peas and something to drink for $4?

335
00:26:04,693 --> 00:26:08,075
- What the heck is in that bag?
- It's those Chinese peas.

336
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:10,609
They're not?

337
00:26:11,316 --> 00:26:12,876
They're Japanese?

338
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:15,085
Chinese, Japanese. Same thing.

339
00:26:18,515 --> 00:26:19,692
Try one.

340
00:26:29,811 --> 00:26:32,778
Jesus Christ! Tastes like black pepper.

341
00:26:33,042 --> 00:26:34,448
Give me those.

342
00:26:35,473 --> 00:26:39,498
Little bastard. Did you see that?
He tried to fucking poison me.

343
00:26:39,569 --> 00:26:43,398
No, he didn't, Joe. Listen to me.
Those things are very expensive.

344
00:26:43,473 --> 00:26:46,156
They're like a delicacy. A refined taste.

345
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:48,205
Refined taste, my ass.

346
00:26:52,433 --> 00:26:54,320
Jesus Christ, not again.

347
00:26:55,056 --> 00:26:58,536
I can't even light a fucking cigarette
around here without getting busted.

348
00:26:58,608 --> 00:27:01,258
You know something?
You really are a fucking moron.

349
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,334
I'm gonna get to those
big tobacco companies...

350
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,236
and I'm gonna thank them
when they put you in the fucking ground.

351
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:11,465
And did I ever tell that you're like
a fucking wife that I don't need?

352
00:27:13,711 --> 00:27:15,947
Can't fucking enjoy a cigarette.

353
00:28:26,825 --> 00:28:29,759
Excuse me, miss.
Can I get you some more coffee?

354
00:28:32,488 --> 00:28:34,495
I really wish you hadn't done that.

355
00:28:34,568 --> 00:28:38,528
I had it the right color,
the right temperature. It was just right.

356
00:28:42,056 --> 00:28:43,135
Sorry.

357
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:28,632
Hi.

358
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:35,323
Sorry. Sorry about the coffee.

359
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:26,036
- Does your name happen to be Gloria?
- No.

360
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,356
'Cause I thought maybe you...
You're not friends with...

361
00:30:34,846 --> 00:30:35,958
Sorry.

362
00:31:09,756 --> 00:31:11,992
So can I get you something else?

363
00:31:12,348 --> 00:31:15,511
A sandwich? Something to eat
along with your coffee?

364
00:31:16,924 --> 00:31:20,535
It's not a very healthy lunch,
just the coffee and cigarettes.

365
00:31:20,731 --> 00:31:22,618
It's not my lunch, okay?

366
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,442
Sorry.

367
00:33:26,962 --> 00:33:27,976
Alex.

368
00:33:29,137 --> 00:33:30,631
You startled me.

369
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,867
How are you, Isaach?

370
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:35,592
Okay?

371
00:33:39,249 --> 00:33:40,525
Very well.

372
00:33:41,648 --> 00:33:43,371
I'm happy to see you.

373
00:33:43,536 --> 00:33:46,667
I was so sick of being in Paris.
You can't imagine.

374
00:33:49,392 --> 00:33:50,602
Sit down.

375
00:33:57,231 --> 00:33:59,434
So, I was happy to get your call.

376
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,886
So long time we didn't see each other.

377
00:34:05,102 --> 00:34:09,029
- I ordered you some coffee, okay?
- Yeah, sure. Thanks.

378
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:12,844
So, everything is okay?

379
00:34:14,862 --> 00:34:17,676
Everything is okay. Very good.

380
00:34:18,893 --> 00:34:20,103
I am fine.

381
00:35:03,881 --> 00:35:06,979
So, are you sure that
everything is okay with you?

382
00:35:10,249 --> 00:35:11,907
Everything is okay.

383
00:35:13,993 --> 00:35:15,170
And you?

384
00:35:15,465 --> 00:35:17,886
Me? Things are okay.

385
00:35:18,376 --> 00:35:21,310
Not perfect, you know,
but pretty much okay.

386
00:35:22,344 --> 00:35:25,191
Good. I'm very happy to see you.

387
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:28,317
I'm happy to see you, man.

388
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:48,226
It's just that
since I didn't see you for so long...

389
00:35:48,294 --> 00:35:52,352
and you called to say you wanted to see me,
I thought maybe something was wrong.

390
00:35:52,422 --> 00:35:56,382
No. I just wanted to see you, that's all.

391
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:00,350
Me, too, man. I wanted to see you, too.

392
00:36:11,684 --> 00:36:14,717
Are you sure there's nothing
you want to tell me?

393
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,154
- Nothing bothering you?
- But why?

394
00:36:19,363 --> 00:36:22,559
- Do you want something to be wrong?
- Not at all.

395
00:36:23,396 --> 00:36:27,257
When I got your call, I had an intuition
that something was bothering you.

396
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:30,713
Something maybe you need to talk about.
That's all, man.

397
00:36:31,267 --> 00:36:33,950
Isaach, there is nothing wrong.

398
00:36:35,011 --> 00:36:36,156
Really.

399
00:36:38,626 --> 00:36:39,640
Okay?

400
00:36:44,866 --> 00:36:46,272
Are you sure?

401
00:36:47,713 --> 00:36:49,501
Are you crazy, Isaach?

402
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:58,909
Are you sure you have nothing...

403
00:36:59,297 --> 00:37:01,598
you know, to let out?

404
00:37:05,792 --> 00:37:07,930
Should I invent something bad?

405
00:37:08,288 --> 00:37:10,197
I could invent something bad for you.

406
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:14,046
Not at all.
No. I don't want you to invent something.

407
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,565
You know, I'm your best friend.

408
00:37:16,671 --> 00:37:19,452
You should feel completely free
to tell me the truth.

409
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:22,268
To tell me whatever is bothering you.

410
00:37:23,166 --> 00:37:24,726
Cut the shit.

411
00:37:29,631 --> 00:37:33,078
Okay, I understand. That's cool.

412
00:37:35,101 --> 00:37:36,377
Thank you.

413
00:37:38,045 --> 00:37:39,353
No problem.

414
00:37:39,613 --> 00:37:42,067
Isaach, no problem.

415
00:38:06,395 --> 00:38:08,118
I guess I'm gonna go.

416
00:38:08,635 --> 00:38:11,001
Really? So soon?

417
00:38:12,315 --> 00:38:14,070
Yeah, you know, man...

418
00:38:14,202 --> 00:38:18,358
if you don't want to talk to me about it,
I don't want to be a problem.

419
00:38:20,218 --> 00:38:24,243
There is no problem, Isaach.
Don't you understand? No problem.

420
00:38:24,826 --> 00:38:27,793
I understand. But listen...

421
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:32,310
if you don't want to talk now,
call me anytime, okay?

422
00:38:33,721 --> 00:38:37,016
Now maybe it's not the right time for you,
that's all.

423
00:38:55,287 --> 00:38:57,326
So, I was very happy to see you.

424
00:38:58,103 --> 00:38:59,957
Yes. Me, too.

425
00:39:00,983 --> 00:39:05,139
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but there is nothing wrong. Really.

426
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,304
It's okay.

427
00:39:09,878 --> 00:39:11,252
I do understand.

428
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:14,034
No. You don't understand.

429
00:39:16,853 --> 00:39:18,030
Call me.

430
00:39:18,677 --> 00:39:20,171
See you, Isaach.

431
00:39:20,822 --> 00:39:21,934
Soon.

432
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,788
- Hi, so nice to see you.
- You, too.

433
00:40:38,991 --> 00:40:40,485
It's been ages.

434
00:40:43,471 --> 00:40:46,405
Last time, what?
A couple of years ago in Sydney, wasn't it?

435
00:40:46,478 --> 00:40:48,582
Really, was that two years ago?

436
00:40:50,255 --> 00:40:52,077
How are Jeff and Beryl?

437
00:40:52,238 --> 00:40:56,939
You know, same old, same old.
Still stuck in their odd little parental ways.

438
00:40:59,022 --> 00:41:02,317
So you're not with Mr. Cate and the baby
on this trip?

439
00:41:02,957 --> 00:41:06,982
No. Unfortunately, I'm by myself.
I'll see them next week.

440
00:41:10,988 --> 00:41:12,416
Everyone's good?

441
00:41:14,988 --> 00:41:16,875
Yeah, I want a baby.

442
00:41:18,252 --> 00:41:19,680
At some point.

443
00:41:21,196 --> 00:41:24,229
- What can I get for you?
- What are you having, Catie?

444
00:41:26,828 --> 00:41:29,729
Can I have an espresso, please?
In a large cup?

445
00:41:31,051 --> 00:41:33,832
Yeah, I'll have an espresso, too, thanks.
A double.

446
00:41:33,899 --> 00:41:36,768
And can I have some hot milk on the side?
And could you heat it?

447
00:41:36,842 --> 00:41:39,427
- I think we can manage that.
- Thank you.

448
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:47,584
I'm sorry I'm late.
I know you haven't got a lot of time.

449
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:52,168
Don't worry about it.
I just wish I could stay here longer.

450
00:41:52,873 --> 00:41:56,647
Do you stay here overnight,
or do you just do your press stuff here?

451
00:41:56,713 --> 00:41:58,054
Your junket.

452
00:42:00,073 --> 00:42:03,421
No, I stay overnight.
And I do the interviews here, too.

453
00:42:03,528 --> 00:42:05,022
I just think it's easier.

454
00:42:05,129 --> 00:42:07,365
They do the interviews in my suite upstairs.

455
00:42:07,432 --> 00:42:09,766
They're setting up for the next interview...

456
00:42:09,831 --> 00:42:13,987
and I just thought maybe it would be nicer
if we met down here.

457
00:42:16,455 --> 00:42:19,138
No, thanks, Shell. You're not...

458
00:42:21,447 --> 00:42:22,559
Go on.

459
00:42:23,111 --> 00:42:25,631
They're not going to stop you smoking.

460
00:42:30,695 --> 00:42:32,799
- There you go, cous'.
- Thanks.

461
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:40,482
So you mean they give you
this full-on hotel suite...

462
00:42:40,549 --> 00:42:43,166
and they also use it for your publicity?

463
00:42:45,253 --> 00:42:47,227
Seems kind of cheap.

464
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:51,929
Well, it's a suite.
So they just divide up the room.

465
00:42:52,005 --> 00:42:53,946
Yeah, but why couldn't
they get you a suite...

466
00:42:54,021 --> 00:42:56,737
and get another suite to do your press in?

467
00:42:57,124 --> 00:42:59,741
It's pretty low-budget, this thing I did.

468
00:43:00,164 --> 00:43:01,505
Yeah, still.

469
00:43:03,139 --> 00:43:04,699
It's pretty cheap, man.

470
00:43:07,811 --> 00:43:09,371
Can I get you anything else?

471
00:43:09,444 --> 00:43:11,810
- No, thanks. That's great.
- You're welcome.

472
00:43:17,667 --> 00:43:20,666
Kind of weird getting in here.
I almost didn't...

473
00:43:22,658 --> 00:43:25,243
until they found out I was your cousin.

474
00:43:26,754 --> 00:43:30,398
There're some photographer,
paparazzi guys hanging out front.

475
00:43:31,297 --> 00:43:34,166
I guess they kind of
follow you around, right?

476
00:43:34,817 --> 00:43:38,558
You know, whatever so-called celebrities
are around, I suppose.

477
00:43:39,265 --> 00:43:42,941
God, that must be
a real fucking drag sometimes, right?

478
00:43:44,928 --> 00:43:46,618
I mean, not like me.

479
00:43:47,392 --> 00:43:48,602
I'm free.

480
00:43:49,056 --> 00:43:51,160
Practically broke, but I'm completely free.

481
00:43:51,232 --> 00:43:54,101
No one's stalking me,
that's for fucking sure.

482
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,592
Except when they thought I was you.

483
00:43:58,175 --> 00:44:02,135
I got into this club once
because they thought I was you.

484
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:06,584
Then they found out I wasn't
and asked me to leave.

485
00:44:06,687 --> 00:44:08,345
Pretty fucking rude.

486
00:44:10,558 --> 00:44:13,623
Don't get me wrong.
I mean, it must be fabulous. You got it all.

487
00:44:13,694 --> 00:44:15,832
You got a good husband, beautiful baby.

488
00:44:15,902 --> 00:44:18,869
Travel all over the world,
stay in fancy hotels.

489
00:44:20,093 --> 00:44:21,401
Parties...

490
00:44:22,109 --> 00:44:25,404
You know what they say,
"The grass is always greener."

491
00:44:25,853 --> 00:44:27,445
So, how's...

492
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:30,580
Shit.

493
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,114
- Johnny.
- Who?

494
00:44:32,189 --> 00:44:34,163
Jimmy. Tommy. Sorry.

495
00:44:35,485 --> 00:44:36,761
How is he?

496
00:44:39,612 --> 00:44:41,913
We broke up almost two years ago.

497
00:44:43,612 --> 00:44:45,716
Tommy, yeah. What a dickhead.

498
00:44:47,356 --> 00:44:49,941
Got a new boyfriend now. Lee. Remember?

499
00:44:51,067 --> 00:44:53,401
He's in a band. Wrote you about him.

500
00:44:53,723 --> 00:44:56,111
He's a pretty huge part of my life.

501
00:44:56,891 --> 00:44:59,094
Sorry, Shell, I don't think you did.

502
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:01,650
Yeah, I even sent you his fucking CD.

503
00:45:02,618 --> 00:45:05,487
Your assistant
probably didn't give it to you.

504
00:45:06,906 --> 00:45:10,866
It's okay. It's totally cool.
I mean, I know how busy your life is.

505
00:45:11,898 --> 00:45:14,679
- Do you remember where you sent it?
- No.

506
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,967
I mean, one week you're in LA...

507
00:45:18,073 --> 00:45:20,014
then you're in London,
then you're in Sydney.

508
00:45:20,089 --> 00:45:23,918
I mean, you're in a different fucking city
every day of the week.

509
00:45:36,248 --> 00:45:39,892
I'd love to hear the music.
What does it sound like?

510
00:45:41,623 --> 00:45:43,029
It's really...

511
00:45:44,695 --> 00:45:46,123
kind of hard...

512
00:45:46,678 --> 00:45:49,394
and it's industrial, kind of throbbing...

513
00:45:52,758 --> 00:45:54,765
I don't think you'd get it.

514
00:45:58,006 --> 00:46:00,656
- What are they called?
- They're called Sqürl.

515
00:46:01,398 --> 00:46:02,608
Squirrel.

516
00:46:02,774 --> 00:46:05,457
No, Sqürl. You know, like they say it here.

517
00:46:05,525 --> 00:46:08,558
S-Q-U-R-L, with an umlaut
over the "U." Sqürl.

518
00:46:09,941 --> 00:46:13,236
Sqürl. I get it. Right.

519
00:46:13,652 --> 00:46:16,106
So can I buy the CD
until I find the one you sent?

520
00:46:16,213 --> 00:46:20,816
No. Not yet. They recorded it independently,
you know, so...

521
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:24,531
But I think the record company's
gonna put it out finally.

522
00:46:24,596 --> 00:46:25,773
I think.

523
00:46:30,516 --> 00:46:33,744
I'm gonna have to find that CD
so I can listen to it.

524
00:46:34,803 --> 00:46:36,712
You're not gonna find it.

525
00:46:36,819 --> 00:46:39,469
Shell, that isn't fair, actually.

526
00:46:39,986 --> 00:46:42,855
- It's true. You're not gonna find it.
- Really?

527
00:46:44,626 --> 00:46:48,487
I fucking know you're not.
'Cause I just remembered...

528
00:46:48,594 --> 00:46:51,725
I didn't actually send it to you.

529
00:46:51,794 --> 00:46:54,728
I think I just thought
about sending it to you.

530
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,479
Almost forgot. This is for you.

531
00:47:14,576 --> 00:47:16,583
Thanks. What is it?

532
00:47:19,632 --> 00:47:23,014
This is really expensive stuff.
It must have cost hundreds.

533
00:47:27,247 --> 00:47:29,963
Cool, thanks. I could use this stuff.

534
00:47:31,343 --> 00:47:33,863
Make me look like a movie star, right?

535
00:47:37,262 --> 00:47:39,203
- Cheers.
- Cheers, gorgeous.

536
00:47:45,261 --> 00:47:48,326
Seriously, Catie, thanks for seeing me.

537
00:47:50,157 --> 00:47:52,044
No, thanks for seeing me.

538
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,096
And thanks for all the fancy swag.

539
00:47:58,764 --> 00:48:00,170
It's nothing.

540
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:04,135
It is swag, isn't it?

541
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:08,448
They probably give you
all kinds of free stuff:

542
00:48:08,524 --> 00:48:10,182
Jewelry, clothes.

543
00:48:10,827 --> 00:48:12,965
Probably give you cars, right?

544
00:48:13,227 --> 00:48:15,844
No, they don't give me cars.

545
00:48:16,843 --> 00:48:19,526
They sometimes give me makeup,
from time to time.

546
00:48:19,595 --> 00:48:21,634
But I just thought...

547
00:48:21,707 --> 00:48:24,041
I don't know, I just wanted...

548
00:48:24,139 --> 00:48:26,375
Didn't have time to go shopping.

549
00:48:26,666 --> 00:48:29,961
No, really, it's fine.
I mean, it's great. I can use it.

550
00:48:30,154 --> 00:48:32,837
It's just funny, don't you think?

551
00:48:32,905 --> 00:48:37,279
When you can't afford something,
it's really expensive.

552
00:48:37,353 --> 00:48:40,134
And then when you can afford it, it's free.

553
00:48:42,345 --> 00:48:44,613
Kind of backward, don't you think?

554
00:48:46,761 --> 00:48:50,056
The world's a bit like that, I guess,
in a lot of ways.

555
00:48:51,464 --> 00:48:53,351
Speaking of paparazzi...

556
00:48:53,512 --> 00:48:56,326
I saw these photos of you the other day
in the tabloids.

557
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:58,627
Don't tell me that. Yuck.

558
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,345
What was I wearing?

559
00:49:01,863 --> 00:49:02,910
Sorry.

560
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,425
Hello? Hi, Lindsey.

561
00:49:09,991 --> 00:49:13,471
I'm downstairs, in the coffee room
with my cousin Shelly.

562
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,060
It's already...

563
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:21,277
Okay, yeah. I'll be up in a minute. Bye.

564
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:22,941
- Got to get back to work?
- Yeah.

565
00:49:23,013 --> 00:49:24,605
Back to the grind?

566
00:49:27,046 --> 00:49:28,507
Do you want to come up to the room?

567
00:49:28,614 --> 00:49:31,712
It won't be very interesting,
but you're welcome to come up.

568
00:49:31,781 --> 00:49:34,682
What, and watch you do TV interviews
and stuff?

569
00:49:34,949 --> 00:49:36,956
Like Entertainment Tonight?

570
00:49:46,244 --> 00:49:49,953
Maybe you can send me that CD,
or a letter, or something.

571
00:49:50,051 --> 00:49:54,458
- Yeah, but you wouldn't read it.
- Stop it. I would if you actually sent it.

572
00:49:58,051 --> 00:50:00,155
I've really gotta go. Sorry.

573
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:04,253
It was great seeing you.
Have you got my numbers?

574
00:50:09,378 --> 00:50:11,930
Take care. Send my love to everyone.

575
00:50:15,169 --> 00:50:17,885
Yeah, send my love to everyone
on your end.

576
00:50:22,465 --> 00:50:24,374
If they even remember me.

577
00:50:24,481 --> 00:50:26,488
- Bye, Catie.
- See you, Shell.

578
00:50:27,584 --> 00:50:30,551
Put that on my room
and anything else she wants.

579
00:50:30,657 --> 00:50:33,504
- Maybe next time I'll get to meet Lou.
- Yeah.

580
00:50:34,816 --> 00:50:36,026
It's Lee.

581
00:50:43,936 --> 00:50:45,212
Excuse me.

582
00:50:47,327 --> 00:50:50,196
Can I have a tequila?
Thanks, a double, and the menu.

583
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:53,084
I'm sorry, there's no smoking in the lounge.

584
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:42,673
So, Jack, you going to tell me
about your tesla coil?

585
00:52:43,478 --> 00:52:45,779
You said you didn't want to hear about it.

586
00:52:45,846 --> 00:52:48,431
Yeah, but that was a while ago.

587
00:52:49,942 --> 00:52:52,559
I don't know if I want to talk about it.

588
00:52:55,156 --> 00:52:56,497
Come on, Jack.

589
00:52:56,565 --> 00:52:59,499
You dragged it all the way down here
in your little red wagon.

590
00:52:59,573 --> 00:53:01,776
Come on, just tell me about it.

591
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:09,802
I built it based on the inventor
Nikola Tesla's original designs.

592
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:12,787
It's an air transformer...

593
00:53:13,011 --> 00:53:16,588
with primary and secondary coils
that are tuned to resonate.

594
00:53:17,203 --> 00:53:19,952
It's basically a step-up transformer...

595
00:53:20,019 --> 00:53:24,273
which converts relatively low-voltage
high current to high-voltage low current...

596
00:53:24,339 --> 00:53:26,029
at high frequencies.

597
00:53:27,794 --> 00:53:29,222
Do you remember...

598
00:53:29,299 --> 00:53:32,975
when we were kids,
you had a little Barbie makeup mirror?

599
00:53:33,553 --> 00:53:35,341
Yeah, I remember that.

600
00:53:35,729 --> 00:53:38,216
It had a little fluorescent light on it?

601
00:53:39,057 --> 00:53:41,674
Nikola Tesla invented fluorescent light.

602
00:53:42,449 --> 00:53:45,198
Without him,
we wouldn't have alternating current...

603
00:53:45,265 --> 00:53:48,712
radio, television, x-ray technology...

604
00:53:49,713 --> 00:53:53,258
induction motors, particle beams, lasers.

605
00:53:53,456 --> 00:53:56,587
None of that would even exist,
if it weren't for him.

606
00:53:56,656 --> 00:53:58,510
Or the rock band, Tesla.

607
00:54:01,616 --> 00:54:02,728
Funny.

608
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:06,862
Tesla was a true genius.

609
00:54:07,439 --> 00:54:11,945
If we had paid more attention to his ideas,
the world would be a much better place.

610
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:15,113
We'd have free mass communication,
free transportation...

611
00:54:15,215 --> 00:54:16,775
free energy for everyone.

612
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:20,456
That's why they discredited him in the end.
For free energy.

613
00:54:22,446 --> 00:54:26,122
He perceived the Earth
as a conductor of acoustical resonance.

614
00:54:30,157 --> 00:54:31,945
What a beautiful idea.

615
00:54:35,821 --> 00:54:39,049
So, Jack, are you going to show me
how the coil works?

616
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:41,826
Yeah, all right.

617
00:54:44,876 --> 00:54:46,468
You'll need these.

618
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:16,031
- All right, you ready, Meg?
- I'm ready.

619
00:55:45,831 --> 00:55:47,969
Damn it. Something went wrong.

620
00:55:49,319 --> 00:55:51,009
It was cool, though.

621
00:55:51,911 --> 00:55:55,172
Yeah, but it wasn't supposed to stop.
It was supposed to keep working.

622
00:55:55,239 --> 00:55:57,126
I don't know what happened.

623
00:55:57,223 --> 00:55:59,589
I think maybe you blew a capacitor?

624
00:55:59,911 --> 00:56:02,299
No, I didn't blow a capacitor, Meg.

625
00:56:05,158 --> 00:56:07,045
Maybe it tripped your GFI.

626
00:56:07,622 --> 00:56:09,923
Yeah, your Ground Fault Interrupter.

627
00:56:09,989 --> 00:56:13,284
Yeah, I know what a GFI is.
That's not what happened.

628
00:56:14,469 --> 00:56:16,257
You don't have to snap at me.

629
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:35,546
I think maybe the spark gaps
are too far apart on your spark coil vibrator.

630
00:56:44,547 --> 00:56:46,369
Yeah, that could be it.

631
00:56:47,843 --> 00:56:49,020
I guess.

632
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:54,464
Yeah, it is. That's it.

633
00:56:55,489 --> 00:56:58,717
You're right about that.
I didn't check that earlier.

634
00:57:11,264 --> 00:57:13,652
I'm gonna go home and check it out.

635
00:57:15,424 --> 00:57:18,173
- Are you going to go bowling tomorrow?
- Yeah, I'll be there.

636
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,279
All right, I'll see you there.

637
00:58:06,109 --> 00:58:08,923
Earth as a conductor
of acoustical resonance.

638
00:58:30,619 --> 00:58:32,920
Hello, who is this?

639
00:58:33,434 --> 00:58:36,597
Laura. Hi, this is Alfred Molina
for Steve Coogan.

640
00:58:41,081 --> 00:58:43,055
M-O-L-l-N-A.

641
00:58:45,305 --> 00:58:46,766
The actor, yes.

642
00:58:48,569 --> 00:58:51,154
I was just double-checking that Steve...

643
00:58:51,384 --> 00:58:53,620
He is. Great, okay.

644
00:58:53,849 --> 00:58:56,336
Just in case you need it,
my cell phone number...

645
00:58:56,408 --> 00:58:57,520
Hello?

646
00:59:07,448 --> 00:59:09,902
- Hello, Alfred.
- Steve, hello.

647
00:59:10,743 --> 00:59:14,004
Hi. I'm so glad you could make it.
Please sit down.

648
00:59:14,647 --> 00:59:18,737
I was just talking to Laura, your assistant,
seeing if you were on your way here.

649
00:59:18,807 --> 00:59:20,268
- I'm here.
- Fantastic.

650
00:59:20,342 --> 00:59:22,959
I took the liberty of ordering some tea.

651
00:59:23,606 --> 00:59:25,067
Shall I be mother?

652
00:59:25,622 --> 00:59:28,010
That's okay, I'll be my own mother.

653
00:59:28,373 --> 00:59:30,260
Some milk there for you.

654
00:59:31,446 --> 00:59:32,623
Real tea.

655
00:59:34,261 --> 00:59:35,471
It's hard to come by.

656
00:59:35,573 --> 00:59:40,013
I have this fantasy where if I ever won
a Golden Globe or an Academy Award...

657
00:59:40,117 --> 00:59:44,426
I'd use the opportunity to tell the Yanks
how to make a decent cup of tea.

658
00:59:45,812 --> 00:59:48,299
- Here's to a good cup of tea.
- Cheers.

659
00:59:53,012 --> 00:59:55,346
I love your coat.

660
00:59:56,211 --> 00:59:58,098
Yeah, it's Viv Westwood.

661
01:00:00,819 --> 01:00:03,371
I've got a weakness for British designers.

662
01:00:03,443 --> 01:00:05,646
I don't know what it is
about American designers.

663
01:00:05,747 --> 01:00:07,918
They're just too safe.

664
01:00:09,202 --> 01:00:12,976
Aren't you going to be a little bit warm?
It's about 85 outside.

665
01:00:13,938 --> 01:00:16,304
No, I take it off when I go out.

666
01:00:17,073 --> 01:00:19,276
It's just the air conditioning.

667
01:00:26,225 --> 01:00:30,697
- So how long have you been living in LA?
- We've been here about seven years.

668
01:00:31,185 --> 01:00:32,745
We love it here.

669
01:00:34,416 --> 01:00:36,106
I do love visiting LA.

670
01:00:36,176 --> 01:00:40,616
But I always say, it's a great place to visit,
it's an even nicer place to leave.

671
01:00:42,704 --> 01:00:44,045
The palm trees...

672
01:00:44,368 --> 01:00:46,756
Palm trees annoy the fuck out of me.

673
01:00:47,568 --> 01:00:50,415
It's not for everybody. I like it here.

674
01:00:50,479 --> 01:00:53,512
I came out here for the work and stuff.

675
01:00:56,655 --> 01:00:59,207
It's great to finally meet you.

676
01:00:59,439 --> 01:01:02,373
I've got to say I'm a huge fan of your stuff...

677
01:01:02,446 --> 01:01:04,747
all the stuff you've done on TV,
the comedy stuff.

678
01:01:04,814 --> 01:01:09,515
I've got all the tapes.
I get them sent over. It's fantastic.

679
01:01:10,158 --> 01:01:11,335
Thank you.

680
01:01:17,453 --> 01:01:21,282
Likewise, I'm certainly very aware of you.

681
01:01:21,549 --> 01:01:22,759
Great.

682
01:01:25,261 --> 01:01:27,781
I saw that TV series you did.

683
01:01:28,972 --> 01:01:30,466
Yeah, you saw that?

684
01:01:30,764 --> 01:01:32,738
Yeah. Interesting.

685
01:01:34,284 --> 01:01:36,771
- We got canceled.
- Yeah, I heard that.

686
01:01:38,188 --> 01:01:40,424
Comedy's such a difficult thing.

687
01:01:46,123 --> 01:01:50,694
Your career seems to be going terribly well.
You've got a lot of heat at the moment.

688
01:01:53,322 --> 01:01:54,980
Is that why you're here?

689
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:59,272
The merry-go-round of meetings. It's nice.

690
01:01:59,338 --> 01:02:03,745
People are finally starting
to take a bit of notice, which is great.

691
01:02:03,818 --> 01:02:06,435
- Are you meeting on anything interesting?
- Yeah.

692
01:02:15,081 --> 01:02:19,587
I've got to say you were just fantastic...

693
01:02:19,785 --> 01:02:24,388
in 24 Hour. No, seriously,
24 Hour Party People was just a knockout.

694
01:02:24,456 --> 01:02:27,237
- I mean, brilliant. Great work.
- Thank you.

695
01:02:27,975 --> 01:02:29,949
Really brilliant. It was...

696
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,992
And the reviews...

697
01:02:33,415 --> 01:02:35,683
They were pretty fucking great.

698
01:02:35,751 --> 01:02:38,368
I was amazed because it was...

699
01:02:38,438 --> 01:02:41,885
I didn't think many people would get
all the cultural references.

700
01:02:41,959 --> 01:02:44,860
Sort of, Manchester, early '80s,
the whole music scene.

701
01:02:44,934 --> 01:02:46,144
You'd be surprised.

702
01:02:46,246 --> 01:02:50,336
But a lot of people didn't have any kind
of reference to make to it because...

703
01:02:50,758 --> 01:02:52,765
They know about the bands over here...

704
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:57,026
but the whole thing, your character,
and his running the TV show...

705
01:02:57,093 --> 01:02:58,915
Do you want a cigarette?

706
01:02:58,981 --> 01:03:01,795
- Sorry, they're French.
- No, that's okay. Thanks.

707
01:03:08,037 --> 01:03:09,859
I'll save it for later.

708
01:03:11,716 --> 01:03:12,763
Okay.

709
01:03:22,211 --> 01:03:25,407
So, Laura said that...

710
01:03:26,947 --> 01:03:31,256
you were really keen to meeting.
She wouldn't tell me what it was.

711
01:03:31,363 --> 01:03:34,875
I didn't want to say it over the phone
because it would've sounded weird.

712
01:03:34,946 --> 01:03:37,815
I can imagine how she thought.
This was coming out of nowhere.

713
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:40,061
I phone her up,
and she doesn't know me from Adam.

714
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:42,813
I said, "I must talk to Steve Coogan."

715
01:03:43,042 --> 01:03:44,732
But I wanted to see you in person.

716
01:03:44,802 --> 01:03:46,973
When I found out you'd be here
for a few days...

717
01:03:47,041 --> 01:03:49,790
I thought this was the perfect opportunity
to let you know...

718
01:03:49,889 --> 01:03:52,539
Anyway, I'll get right to it.

719
01:03:53,568 --> 01:03:55,575
I'm so excited about this.

720
01:03:56,481 --> 01:03:58,488
Let me try and put it in context.

721
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:03,417
I've always had a big passion for history...

722
01:04:03,488 --> 01:04:05,462
and people's lives...

723
01:04:05,535 --> 01:04:10,106
and all the little events
of how you get from A to B...

724
01:04:10,943 --> 01:04:13,593
and all the small details in people's lives...

725
01:04:13,664 --> 01:04:16,925
that are kind of really full of epic qualities.

726
01:04:17,375 --> 01:04:20,276
So I've been doing all this research and...

727
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:24,787
I've come up with this.

728
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:28,308
And what state is...
Is it greenlit or is it just a treatment?

729
01:04:28,414 --> 01:04:29,908
What stage is it?

730
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:33,557
I'm sorry. God, it's so embarrassing.

731
01:04:33,725 --> 01:04:37,369
It's not some... This isn't work.
It's got nothing to do with work.

732
01:04:37,437 --> 01:04:39,259
It's not a project.

733
01:04:39,326 --> 01:04:43,155
I did some genealogical research,
and I came across...

734
01:04:43,549 --> 01:04:44,857
What I discovered was...

735
01:04:44,925 --> 01:04:46,680
- Mr. Coogan?
- Yes?

736
01:04:46,749 --> 01:04:48,374
- It is you, isn't it?
- It is, yes.

737
01:04:48,444 --> 01:04:51,542
- I'm such a huge fan.
- You're not that huge.

738
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:54,583
Only where it counts.

739
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:58,581
- Could I bother you for an autograph?
- Absolutely.

740
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:00,884
- Great.
- I've been recognized.

741
01:05:01,211 --> 01:05:02,901
Where do you want it?

742
01:05:03,387 --> 01:05:06,703
- Paper is fine.
- Spoilsport.

743
01:05:08,155 --> 01:05:10,129
- No, don't do that.
- Sorry.

744
01:05:10,202 --> 01:05:13,136
- I probably have something in my bag.
- Okay.

745
01:05:13,531 --> 01:05:15,538
Just give me a second here.

746
01:05:16,763 --> 01:05:17,973
Oh, gosh.

747
01:05:18,394 --> 01:05:20,335
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.

748
01:05:21,625 --> 01:05:24,210
- Give me one more minute.
- Take your time.

749
01:05:24,282 --> 01:05:28,143
- Here, please, in there.
- Okay, and what's your name?

750
01:05:28,345 --> 01:05:29,392
Katy.

751
01:05:30,265 --> 01:05:32,239
- With a "Y."
- All right.

752
01:05:32,921 --> 01:05:34,513
What Katy did next.

753
01:05:35,193 --> 01:05:37,778
- Hello.
- Alfred's an actor, too.

754
01:05:40,505 --> 01:05:42,643
- Here.
- Thank you. Great.

755
01:05:44,536 --> 01:05:47,023
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

756
01:05:52,984 --> 01:05:55,318
- Wow.
- Let's get back to this.

757
01:05:55,383 --> 01:05:58,350
I don't want to take up too much
of your time. I know you're busy.

758
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:01,302
As I said, I did this genealogical research...

759
01:06:01,399 --> 01:06:05,108
I was just doing it for my own interest.
I wasn't looking for anything specific.

760
01:06:05,174 --> 01:06:07,061
I just came across this.

761
01:06:07,862 --> 01:06:10,895
I'll cut a long story short.

762
01:06:11,285 --> 01:06:12,462
Steve Coogan.

763
01:06:13,494 --> 01:06:15,020
Drum roll.

764
01:06:17,013 --> 01:06:18,801
The thing is, Steve...

765
01:06:19,701 --> 01:06:22,351
you and I are cousins.

766
01:06:26,133 --> 01:06:28,980
How do you mean? You mean artistically?

767
01:06:29,301 --> 01:06:33,970
No, I mean in the normal way.
We're cousins. We're related.

768
01:06:37,428 --> 01:06:40,209
- It's amazing, isn't it?
- Yeah. Are you sure?

769
01:06:40,276 --> 01:06:42,512
The way it works out is, look:

770
01:06:42,867 --> 01:06:45,288
My great-great grandfather...

771
01:06:46,131 --> 01:06:48,138
is your great-great uncle.

772
01:06:48,211 --> 01:06:53,098
And further back, we shared
the same great-great-great grandfather.

773
01:06:55,506 --> 01:06:58,407
My ancestry is Irish,
but I knew there was an Italian...

774
01:06:58,482 --> 01:07:00,783
That's it. The Italian connection is...

775
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,915
the great-great-great-great grandfather,
Giuseppe.

776
01:07:04,402 --> 01:07:06,889
- Isn't that amazing?
- Yeah, this is...

777
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:08,748
This is a lot of detail.

778
01:07:08,818 --> 01:07:12,014
- It's my thing, I kind of do a little...
- Amazing.

779
01:07:12,081 --> 01:07:16,303
I think it's just great to be able to say
that I'm related to Steve Coogan.

780
01:07:16,369 --> 01:07:20,263
Likewise, I can tell people
I'm related to Albert Molina.

781
01:07:20,337 --> 01:07:21,482
Alfred.

782
01:07:24,784 --> 01:07:27,947
It's my grandmother who's the big one
on the family tree.

783
01:07:28,016 --> 01:07:29,390
She'll be very thrilled.

784
01:07:29,455 --> 01:07:32,771
She's a huge fan of your work.
She loved you in...

785
01:07:35,823 --> 01:07:37,033
Boogie Nights.

786
01:07:37,135 --> 01:07:39,523
Right. With the shorts and the shotgun?

787
01:07:39,631 --> 01:07:41,932
Yeah, she talked about that once.

788
01:07:42,447 --> 01:07:43,755
Great.

789
01:07:43,854 --> 01:07:47,748
I know this is coming right out of the blue,
but just think of the possibilities.

790
01:07:47,823 --> 01:07:50,091
It's fantastic. Let's look at the facts.

791
01:07:50,158 --> 01:07:54,380
We're both actors.
We're cousins, we've established that.

792
01:07:55,342 --> 01:07:58,407
We could maybe work together,
do a play maybe.

793
01:07:58,478 --> 01:08:00,517
We could make a movie.

794
01:08:00,589 --> 01:08:03,174
We could actually do a movie
about this story.

795
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:06,561
About discovering this amazing thing
between us, that we're cousins.

796
01:08:06,669 --> 01:08:08,556
The story could be two actors...

797
01:08:08,621 --> 01:08:12,417
who discover that they're cousins.
We can actually play ourselves.

798
01:08:12,525 --> 01:08:16,136
We'd be in the movie.
I'd be Fred Molina, you'd be Steve...

799
01:08:16,204 --> 01:08:18,625
We'd be cousins in the movie.

800
01:08:19,628 --> 01:08:22,923
It's fantastic. It'd be great, absolutely great.

801
01:08:24,587 --> 01:08:28,710
You know, or not. We could just hang out.

802
01:08:28,843 --> 01:08:31,974
We should definitely go
for a beer sometime. That'd be great.

803
01:08:32,042 --> 01:08:35,816
Maybe go on vacation together,
just the two of us...

804
01:08:36,394 --> 01:08:38,532
sort of get to know each other.

805
01:08:44,617 --> 01:08:46,439
You're not gay are you?

806
01:08:47,049 --> 01:08:48,030
No.

807
01:08:48,585 --> 01:08:50,145
No, I'm married.

808
01:08:50,409 --> 01:08:52,164
So was James I.

809
01:08:53,033 --> 01:08:56,294
Sorry. I don't know,
that just popped into my head.

810
01:08:56,361 --> 01:08:59,230
- Say it, get it out of the way.
- I understand.

811
01:08:59,721 --> 01:09:01,215
I know exactly what you're thinking.

812
01:09:01,289 --> 01:09:03,557
If somebody came up to me going,
"I'm your cousin"...

813
01:09:03,624 --> 01:09:05,728
I'd think they were a nutter as well.

814
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,294
Take it from me, I'm not crazy.

815
01:09:07,368 --> 01:09:11,622
I just think
this is a fantastic, extraordinary...

816
01:09:12,232 --> 01:09:14,620
- delightful thing for me.
- Absolutely.

817
01:09:14,728 --> 01:09:17,345
- And I just wanted you to know about it.
- Ditto.

818
01:09:17,703 --> 01:09:19,939
All I want, if I want anything...

819
01:09:20,007 --> 01:09:24,479
is for you to just acknowledge
this extraordinary thing...

820
01:09:26,982 --> 01:09:29,021
and just love me.

821
01:09:37,029 --> 01:09:39,036
Yeah, I could do that.

822
01:09:50,373 --> 01:09:53,853
I have to go.

823
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:57,977
I didn't tell you. I have this meeting.

824
01:09:58,148 --> 01:10:00,155
- It actually moved forward.
- I see.

825
01:10:00,228 --> 01:10:04,318
It's at Universal.
Number crunchers, financiers...

826
01:10:11,811 --> 01:10:13,337
- This...
- That's for you.

827
01:10:13,442 --> 01:10:15,351
- That's great.
- It's yours.

828
01:10:17,442 --> 01:10:21,053
- I'll make sure that gets filed.
- Sure.

829
01:10:22,082 --> 01:10:24,023
You'll be here a couple of days, right?

830
01:10:24,097 --> 01:10:26,682
So maybe we could see each other
before you go.

831
01:10:27,778 --> 01:10:30,112
Just checking the mental diary...

832
01:10:35,457 --> 01:10:39,253
This is not good, the time I'm here.

833
01:10:39,456 --> 01:10:41,528
- It's just that it's packed.
- I understand.

834
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:42,614
No problem.

835
01:10:42,688 --> 01:10:46,397
Give me your cell phone number,
and I'll call you before you go.

836
01:10:46,464 --> 01:10:48,154
There's a story there.

837
01:10:48,608 --> 01:10:51,258
There's a tri-band system
here in the States...

838
01:10:51,327 --> 01:10:54,174
which is different to the system in the UK...

839
01:10:54,271 --> 01:10:56,059
and it's a kind of...

840
01:10:56,511 --> 01:11:00,405
The cell phones, they don't work here.
So I'm kind of cell phone-less...

841
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:02,551
- in the US.
- I see.

842
01:11:03,614 --> 01:11:06,134
Well, give me your home number.
I'll call you.

843
01:11:06,207 --> 01:11:08,279
- You've got my PA's number, right?
- Yeah.

844
01:11:08,351 --> 01:11:10,423
Great, then we're connected.

845
01:11:10,686 --> 01:11:13,303
Can't you give me your number at home?

846
01:11:15,998 --> 01:11:17,426
Can I say no?

847
01:11:17,886 --> 01:11:22,522
Because nothing,
absolutely nothing personal...

848
01:11:22,589 --> 01:11:27,258
It's just that I never
give my number out, ever.

849
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:29,266
It's just a personal space thing.

850
01:11:29,341 --> 01:11:33,399
It's just a rule and I always think,
"Stick to the rule."

851
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:36,725
It's more of a philosophy than a rule.

852
01:11:39,772 --> 01:11:43,546
I've not given my number out
to many eminent people in the past.

853
01:11:43,612 --> 01:11:45,913
I once didn't give my number
to Sam Mendes.

854
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:47,889
So you're in good company.

855
01:11:50,363 --> 01:11:53,875
If it's good enough for Sam Mendes,
it's good enough for me.

856
01:11:59,194 --> 01:12:02,095
- I think it's me.
- Right, because mine doesn't work.

857
01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:04,787
I'm sorry, I got to take this. I'll get back.

858
01:12:05,594 --> 01:12:06,542
Hello?

859
01:12:07,929 --> 01:12:09,335
Yeah, sure.

860
01:12:11,546 --> 01:12:14,742
Spike, hi. How you doing?

861
01:12:15,129 --> 01:12:16,917
You got the message.

862
01:12:16,985 --> 01:12:21,075
My agent just called you just to make sure
we're all on the same page.

863
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:26,483
No, the producer credit is just so you and I
can sort of keep tabs on everything.

864
01:12:26,552 --> 01:12:28,755
You know, artistic integrity,
that sort of thing.

865
01:12:28,824 --> 01:12:31,671
Otherwise the whole thing
could just run away.

866
01:12:34,488 --> 01:12:36,462
You bastard, no.

867
01:12:37,527 --> 01:12:38,574
All right.

868
01:12:38,647 --> 01:12:41,330
You still okay for Sunday? Good. All right.

869
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:44,246
Will I meet you there?
All right. Nice and early.

870
01:12:44,311 --> 01:12:47,474
Okay, yeah. Lots of love. Bye, Spike.

871
01:12:48,918 --> 01:12:51,372
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's okay, fine.

872
01:12:54,774 --> 01:12:56,813
Was that Spike Lee?

873
01:12:56,918 --> 01:13:00,911
No. I don't even know Spike Lee.
That was Spike Jonze.

874
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:05,394
- I love him.
- Yeah, he's a good man.

875
01:13:05,941 --> 01:13:09,072
We've been friends for a long time now.

876
01:13:09,301 --> 01:13:11,405
We're both keen hikers.

877
01:13:11,829 --> 01:13:14,512
- Well, it's very boring.
- No, go on.

878
01:13:14,964 --> 01:13:18,957
We belong to a club,
and we go hiking at weekends.

879
01:13:19,348 --> 01:13:23,308
He's a very committed environmentalist.

880
01:13:23,572 --> 01:13:27,466
Spike Jonze is a tree-hugger.
Jesus, I never had him down as that.

881
01:13:31,219 --> 01:13:34,252
I think he prefers the term "leaf people"...

882
01:13:35,059 --> 01:13:36,433
as do I.

883
01:13:39,634 --> 01:13:43,528
Right, I mean, that's...
Don't get me wrong. That's great.

884
01:13:44,594 --> 01:13:48,587
I love trees.
I think there should be more of them.

885
01:13:49,777 --> 01:13:52,198
When I use paper, I use both sides.

886
01:13:53,745 --> 01:13:55,403
I would love to...

887
01:14:00,753 --> 01:14:03,370
You know, I'm going to tear up...

888
01:14:03,441 --> 01:14:06,669
that stupid rule about phone numbers.

889
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:09,160
It's such shit.

890
01:14:11,312 --> 01:14:14,443
Would it be shabby of me
to give you my number now?

891
01:14:17,456 --> 01:14:18,404
Yeah.

892
01:14:28,015 --> 01:14:30,502
I've got to go. I'm so sorry.

893
01:14:33,134 --> 01:14:35,370
- I'll get the check.
- Good.

894
01:14:48,621 --> 01:14:49,733
Fuck.

895
01:15:25,642 --> 01:15:28,063
Damn RZA. Where the fuck you at?

896
01:15:40,553 --> 01:15:42,756
- Yo, peace.
- Bobby.

897
01:15:46,473 --> 01:15:48,327
- Pardon me for being late.
- Ain't nothing.

898
01:15:48,393 --> 01:15:52,287
- I was about to hit you on the horn.
- I had a fucking emergency house call, yo.

899
01:15:52,391 --> 01:15:54,562
- A house call?
- Yeah, a house call.

900
01:15:55,112 --> 01:15:58,886
Sophia and Sifu's children got sick
with the flu and the virus.

901
01:15:59,239 --> 01:16:02,140
So I went by,
prescribed some herbal medicines for them.

902
01:16:02,215 --> 01:16:05,443
I told them, lay off the dairy products,
chill on the citric acid...

903
01:16:05,543 --> 01:16:07,647
and they should feel a little better.

904
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:11,644
- So you a doctor now, or something?
- Yeah, I told you.

905
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:14,684
I've been studying alternative medicine
for two years now, son.

906
01:16:14,758 --> 01:16:17,725
I mean, ancient healing techniques,
and all that.

907
01:16:17,798 --> 01:16:18,943
Check this.

908
01:16:19,014 --> 01:16:23,137
I even know a certain surgical procedure
that I can perform using a drill-gun.

909
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:24,739
Electric drill-gun.

910
01:16:25,349 --> 01:16:26,690
I'm dead serious.

911
01:16:26,757 --> 01:16:30,139
But my hands are nice from being a DJ,
you know what I mean?

912
01:16:30,213 --> 01:16:33,027
To me, music and medicine, all go together.

913
01:16:33,093 --> 01:16:35,481
It's like two planets
revolving around the same sun.

914
01:16:35,556 --> 01:16:36,603
So bong-bong.

915
01:16:36,708 --> 01:16:38,366
- Want some tea?
- Yeah, splash me.

916
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:40,639
It's all herbals, man. No caffeine.

917
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:44,601
That's what I'm talking about. No caffeine.
Caffeine is ridiculous right now, man.

918
01:16:44,708 --> 01:16:46,169
Tell me about it.

919
01:16:46,276 --> 01:16:48,959
Caffeine leads to depression...

920
01:16:49,316 --> 01:16:52,479
makes you all irritable,
have your heart beating fast.

921
01:16:52,547 --> 01:16:54,369
Faster heart rate, you know what I mean?

922
01:16:54,435 --> 01:16:57,817
And worse than anything,
you drink that coffee, it gives you the shits.

923
01:16:57,891 --> 01:17:01,087
You know what I mean?
So I try to stay away from that.

924
01:17:01,154 --> 01:17:04,568
- I'm off that shit, anyway.
- Crisp and clean. No caffeine.

925
01:17:05,026 --> 01:17:08,800
- To Liquid Swords, family.
- No, to Bobby Digital.

926
01:17:08,866 --> 01:17:11,232
- Wu-Tang forever.
- Wu-Tang forever.

927
01:17:13,025 --> 01:17:14,879
Anybody need more coffee?

928
01:17:14,945 --> 01:17:17,432
- Kitchen's closing.
- No, we don't mess with caffeine.

929
01:17:17,537 --> 01:17:19,424
- You don't?
- No, I don't.

930
01:17:19,777 --> 01:17:22,198
Don't you know caffeine
can cause serious delirium?

931
01:17:22,272 --> 01:17:24,344
- Delirium?
- Serious delirium.

932
01:17:24,417 --> 01:17:25,977
Now you tell me.

933
01:17:26,913 --> 01:17:29,214
Well, that may be my problem, delirium.

934
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,574
Aren't you Bill Murray, man?

935
01:17:36,192 --> 01:17:39,126
- You're Bill Murray?
- Yeah, I'm Bill Murray...

936
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:42,068
but let's keep that just between us, all right?

937
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:45,053
Just between us.

938
01:17:47,263 --> 01:17:50,012
And you guys are related?

939
01:17:50,751 --> 01:17:52,692
Yeah, we're cousins. We're family.

940
01:17:52,766 --> 01:17:56,082
No, you're messing with me
because you're both troublemakers.

941
01:17:56,702 --> 01:17:59,090
- Troublemakers?
- The Wu-Tang Clan.

942
01:17:59,166 --> 01:18:00,824
Right, Wu-Tang Clan.

943
01:18:01,470 --> 01:18:03,706
- You're GZA, the genius.
- That's right.

944
01:18:03,773 --> 01:18:06,293
- And you're RZA...
- A.k. A...

945
01:18:08,125 --> 01:18:11,441
- Bobby Digital.
- Yeah, he knows hip-hop.

946
01:18:11,517 --> 01:18:13,339
And you're Bill Murray.

947
01:18:13,725 --> 01:18:17,783
Bill "Groundhog Day,
Ghostbusting ass" Murray.

948
01:18:17,885 --> 01:18:20,918
- "Who ya gonna call?"
- I know that. Just don't tell anybody.

949
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:23,224
What you mean, don't tell anybody,
Bill Murray?

950
01:18:23,292 --> 01:18:26,739
People will come here, they'll see you.
You're Bill Murray. It's obvious.

951
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:29,267
Unless you're wearing a disguise
or something.

952
01:18:30,331 --> 01:18:32,272
I am wearing kind of a disguise.

953
01:18:34,171 --> 01:18:36,112
Damn, that's harsh, money.

954
01:18:36,667 --> 01:18:40,212
- You're a real caffeine junkie, aren't you?
- Keep it down. Just between us.

955
01:18:40,282 --> 01:18:41,710
Here, cheers.

956
01:18:49,082 --> 01:18:51,121
You know, before I gave that up...

957
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:54,291
I used to drink it every single night...

958
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:58,191
up until it was time to go to sleep.
Used to make me dream faster.

959
01:18:58,265 --> 01:19:01,777
You know, like when they flash
those cameras on those Indy 500 cars...

960
01:19:01,848 --> 01:19:03,473
and they just...

961
01:19:06,968 --> 01:19:09,585
That's how my dreams were.
Just whizzing by.

962
01:19:09,816 --> 01:19:12,597
- You're stupid, yo.
- He is stupid, isn't he?

963
01:19:12,792 --> 01:19:14,068
Word, yo.

964
01:19:17,975 --> 01:19:20,211
I know a guy who freezes coffee.

965
01:19:21,015 --> 01:19:23,862
Puts sticks in it,
has himself a coffee Popsicle.

966
01:19:23,927 --> 01:19:25,934
A caf pop.

967
01:19:30,614 --> 01:19:33,647
Damn. That don't sound too good,
Bill Murray.

968
01:19:33,719 --> 01:19:37,067
It's not the flu or anything.
It's just a smoker's cough.

969
01:19:39,126 --> 01:19:43,348
That's what I'm saying, nicotine interferes
with your central nervous system...

970
01:19:43,414 --> 01:19:45,236
your respiratorial system.

971
01:19:45,301 --> 01:19:48,683
In very small doses, it causes paralysis.

972
01:19:52,821 --> 01:19:55,155
- Really?
- Yeah, really, man.

973
01:19:55,221 --> 01:19:57,587
I mean, just 50 mg alone...

974
01:19:58,132 --> 01:20:00,498
have been proven to be fatal
in a few minutes.

975
01:20:00,564 --> 01:20:03,084
- How much is in one cigarette?
- 3 mg.

976
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:06,474
And did you know
they also use nicotine for insecticide...

977
01:20:06,548 --> 01:20:09,581
- to kill bugs?
- It's good if it kills bugs, right?

978
01:20:10,996 --> 01:20:13,003
Are you a bug, Bill Murray?

979
01:20:15,027 --> 01:20:18,092
- Jesus, RZA, you sound like my doctor.
- He is a doctor.

980
01:20:18,451 --> 01:20:21,767
Actually, he specializes
in alternative medicine.

981
01:20:22,194 --> 01:20:24,648
That is, alternative to this planet.

982
01:20:28,658 --> 01:20:32,814
Do me a favor and don't tell anybody
you saw me here, okay?

983
01:20:33,490 --> 01:20:35,464
You can trust us, Bill Murray.

984
01:20:38,161 --> 01:20:42,121
- You hiding out or something?
- Yeah, sort of, something like that.

985
01:20:43,856 --> 01:20:45,797
Now I'm thinking it may be delirium.

986
01:20:45,873 --> 01:20:47,880
- Serious delirium.
- Serious.

987
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:52,709
If you're on the low, I got something
that'll help you with your disguise.

988
01:20:53,296 --> 01:20:54,724
Take this.

989
01:20:55,504 --> 01:20:57,227
- Use whatever you want.
- Jeez.

990
01:20:57,328 --> 01:21:01,037
- Rock that, man. Stay on the low.
- You didn't have to do this. This is great.

991
01:21:01,103 --> 01:21:02,564
A bag of items for you, Bill.

992
01:21:02,671 --> 01:21:04,459
- Thank you.
- Don't worry about it.

993
01:21:04,527 --> 01:21:06,217
I really appreciate this.

994
01:21:08,175 --> 01:21:09,385
This is great.

995
01:21:11,438 --> 01:21:13,379
Doc, what could I do for this cough?

996
01:21:13,455 --> 01:21:16,040
I was just thinking about that.
Check this out.

997
01:21:16,142 --> 01:21:19,883
- You get some hydrogen peroxide.
- We got that for cuts and stuff.

998
01:21:19,982 --> 01:21:23,210
Take 50% hydrogen peroxide, 50% water.

999
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:25,928
You gargle with it.
Do not swallow, you spit it out.

1000
01:21:26,030 --> 01:21:27,436
Don't swallow, Bill Murray.

1001
01:21:27,502 --> 01:21:30,371
And if that doesn't work, try oven cleaner.

1002
01:21:31,533 --> 01:21:33,637
I got that in the back, too.

1003
01:21:33,933 --> 01:21:35,656
- Thank you.
- Cool.

1004
01:21:35,725 --> 01:21:38,408
Thank you. I'm going to try it right now.

1005
01:21:40,941 --> 01:21:42,435
- Word.
- Word, man.

1006
01:21:42,509 --> 01:21:45,258
- Bill motherfucking Murray.
- It's crazy, yo.

1007
01:21:47,915 --> 01:21:49,605
- 3:00.
- What's up?

1008
01:21:49,772 --> 01:21:52,259
I told Ghost to be here by 3:00 a.m.

1009
01:21:52,331 --> 01:21:55,527
Don't hold your breath on that.
You know how it is waiting on Ghost.

1010
01:21:55,595 --> 01:21:58,464
- We'll be here all night.
- Think we can smoke a blunt up here?

1011
01:21:58,571 --> 01:22:02,312
- It's hot up in here with the 5-0.
- But we used to always smoke weed in here.

1012
01:22:02,378 --> 01:22:05,061
That was until Dirt Dog done blew it up.

1013
01:22:05,131 --> 01:22:08,065
Told Deflon,
"Never let Dirty inside this spot, man."

1014
01:22:08,138 --> 01:22:09,960
So what's up? What you want to do?

1015
01:22:10,026 --> 01:22:12,392
- Yo, let's slide to the 'udio.
- Hit the 'udio, right.

1016
01:22:12,458 --> 01:22:14,432
Play some chess? All right, then.

1017
01:22:14,505 --> 01:22:18,082
- Is that the bill for Murray?
- He don't need no money, yo.

1018
01:22:18,153 --> 01:22:20,770
- Hit him, anyway.
- Think I should tip him?

1019
01:22:24,489 --> 01:22:28,645
- You think he's using the oven cleaner?
- Don't know, but let's get the fuck out.

1020
01:22:53,254 --> 01:22:55,141
Are you all right, Taylor?

1021
01:22:57,766 --> 01:23:00,580
- No, not really.
- What's up?

1022
01:23:02,789 --> 01:23:06,563
I don't know.
I feel so divorced from the world.

1023
01:23:07,397 --> 01:23:09,600
I've lost touch with the world.

1024
01:23:10,981 --> 01:23:13,730
Do you know that song by Mahler...

1025
01:23:15,109 --> 01:23:18,457
- I've Lost Track of the World?
- No.

1026
01:23:20,036 --> 01:23:22,937
It's one of the most beautiful...

1027
01:23:23,012 --> 01:23:25,433
and saddest songs ever written.

1028
01:23:29,475 --> 01:23:31,384
I can almost hear it now.

1029
01:23:36,867 --> 01:23:38,361
Can you hear it?

1030
01:24:28,703 --> 01:24:30,131
It's gone now.

1031
01:24:30,879 --> 01:24:33,660
- But did you hear it?
- I think so.

1032
01:24:37,342 --> 01:24:40,407
It resonated
right through the whole building.

1033
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:45,210
- Where are we?
- In the armory, Taylor.

1034
01:24:46,973 --> 01:24:48,914
"The armory, Taylor."

1035
01:24:51,389 --> 01:24:54,771
It sounds so heavy and ponderous.

1036
01:24:56,189 --> 01:24:57,749
"The armory."

1037
01:24:59,196 --> 01:25:01,977
Nikola Tesla...

1038
01:25:03,388 --> 01:25:06,704
perceived the Earth as a conductor...

1039
01:25:07,388 --> 01:25:10,519
of acoustical resonance.

1040
01:25:13,947 --> 01:25:16,630
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1041
01:25:18,875 --> 01:25:20,784
Can you explain it to me?

1042
01:25:20,987 --> 01:25:23,539
- No, not really.
- I know.

1043
01:25:24,603 --> 01:25:26,937
Let's pretend this coffee is champagne.

1044
01:25:28,826 --> 01:25:30,581
Why would we do that?

1045
01:25:31,226 --> 01:25:33,298
Well, to celebrate life.

1046
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:37,941
You know, like the rich, elegant people do.

1047
01:25:38,938 --> 01:25:40,661
The classy people.

1048
01:25:42,105 --> 01:25:45,966
I prefer coffee.
Simple, working man's coffee.

1049
01:25:48,601 --> 01:25:52,626
You're so provincial, Bill.
Do you know what your problem is?

1050
01:25:54,136 --> 01:25:55,150
What?

1051
01:25:56,920 --> 01:26:00,564
You have no joie de vivre.

1052
01:26:02,711 --> 01:26:03,888
I don't?

1053
01:26:05,559 --> 01:26:08,973
No. Besides, this coffee is awful.

1054
01:26:11,479 --> 01:26:14,893
- You're right. It really is bad, isn't it?
- Dreadful.

1055
01:26:16,119 --> 01:26:18,093
I propose a toast.

1056
01:26:19,415 --> 01:26:21,302
So what should we toast?

1057
01:26:24,406 --> 01:26:27,537
Paris in the 1920s.

1058
01:26:27,861 --> 01:26:30,577
Josephine Baker, the Moulin Rouge.

1059
01:26:31,221 --> 01:26:33,260
What is it? Okay?

1060
01:26:34,805 --> 01:26:36,113
And also...

1061
01:26:36,852 --> 01:26:39,372
New York in the '70s.

1062
01:26:39,669 --> 01:26:41,578
In the late '70s.

1063
01:26:42,453 --> 01:26:44,275
Really? All right.

1064
01:26:44,885 --> 01:26:46,640
Cheers.

1065
01:26:52,019 --> 01:26:53,677
Delicious, isn't it?

1066
01:26:55,667 --> 01:26:59,015
Champagne: Nectar of the gods.

1067
01:27:00,627 --> 01:27:03,758
Is that all you're having for lunch,
coffee and a cigarette?

1068
01:27:03,827 --> 01:27:05,517
It's not very healthy.

1069
01:27:07,155 --> 01:27:08,878
We had lunch earlier.

1070
01:27:12,178 --> 01:27:13,355
We did?

1071
01:27:14,897 --> 01:27:18,922
We're on a break here, a coffee break.

1072
01:27:20,529 --> 01:27:22,252
How depressing.

1073
01:27:23,569 --> 01:27:25,576
How long is our break, anyway?

1074
01:27:25,681 --> 01:27:28,909
About 10 minutes, and it's nearly over now.

1075
01:27:32,881 --> 01:27:34,571
Say it isn't true.

1076
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:39,109
- Well?
- What?

1077
01:27:40,272 --> 01:27:42,988
I asked you to say it isn't true.

1078
01:27:43,568 --> 01:27:45,226
Say what isn't true?

1079
01:27:47,151 --> 01:27:48,841
Never mind.

1080
01:27:50,671 --> 01:27:52,775
Anyway, I have to have a nap.

1081
01:27:55,183 --> 01:27:58,597
So call me when the break is over.

1082
01:28:01,230 --> 01:28:05,637
Well, you have two minutes or less
for your nap.

1083
01:28:44,939 --> 01:28:46,826
And now, the news.
