1
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:50,509
Wait here.
I don't know how long I'll be.

2
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yes, sir.

3
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Heil Hitler.

4
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,879
He won't last five minutes.

5
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,966
How do you know?

6
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:39,349
Because the others didn't.

7
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:46,064
Doctor Hess, General Mueller is waiting impatiently
for the results of your Deathcore project.

8
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,819
I know! I know!

9
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:56,033
We are generous enough to give you a lab
with the best of equipment...

10
00:01:56,199 --> 00:02:00,078
... and the freedom to proceed as you wish.

11
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,082
We expect something in return.
This just won't do.

12
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:13,633
Well, then perhaps General Mueller
should have given this project to Mengele
or one of the other butchers instead of me.

13
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:32,569
The loss of our troops on the
Russian front is crippling us.

14
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,826
You said you could devise a drug that would give
this dead soldier movement...

15
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:44,539
... so he could be used as a
shield for the living troops, yes?

16
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:50,670
If you lied about your abilities,
then you are a traitor, doctor.

17
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:54,383
I didn't lie!

18
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:59,388
- But I need more time!
- I don't have the authority to extend time...

19
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:05,310
... but I must report your failure.

20
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,660
This world ain't big enough
for the both of us, partner.

21
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:31,289
I will conquer the world, and
there's nothing you can do to stop me.

22
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:37,128
I wouldn't say that, you sidewinder.

23
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:24,009
I never know what they're going
to do or say.

24
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:27,137
Let me hide in your pocket.

25
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,222
You have been stealing.

26
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,308
Father, I didn't steal a...

27
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,393
Peppermints, peppermints everywhere, look.

28
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,478
It's a good job you put plenty of candy
into Peter's pocket...

29
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:39,649
... or we might have been very angry with you.
Mightn't we, Peter?

30
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,611
I will forgive him.

31
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,948
All right, children. Now the puppets are
very tired. They must go to bed now.

32
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,076
Sleep? Puppets need to sleep?

33
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,204
Puppets need sleep just as much
as you do.

34
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,000
Goodbye.

35
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,290
Please come back and see us again soon.

36
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,375
Ok, Mr. Toulon.

37
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:01,504
Come, Peter. Come, children.

38
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Come, Peter.

39
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,571
You have a devoted audience, Mr. Toulon.

40
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,657
I know I'm devoted to them.

41
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,661
They love your puppets.

42
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:36,998
The children enjoy the show, and I'm
rewarded by their laughter,
which is honest.

43
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,126
If not always prudent.

44
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:45,340
I wonder if they laughed so hard
if they truly understood
what they were watching.

45
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:50,387
Oh, I'm sure they would.
Political satire is one of the
marks of a healthy society.

46
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:53,682
I didn't get your name.

47
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,767
Lieutenant Erich Stein.

48
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,852
Fellow puppeteer.

49
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:04,150
I've been carving marionettes since
I was ten years old, and I must say
your craftsmanship is superb.

50
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,194
You are very kind, Lieutenant.

51
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:10,990
How do you manipulate them
without string-works?

52
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,536
Motorization. It is my own method.

53
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,539
Fascinating.

54
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,792
Almost like magic.

55
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,963
One day, I'd like to see you work.

56
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:29,134
I'm sure that could be arranged.

57
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,263
You are an artist, Mr. Toulon.

58
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:37,475
I just hope that you'll be allowed to
continue practicing your art.

59
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,500
Eight shows a week is
enough practice for me.

60
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,500
Quite.

61
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:47,777
For your own sake, you might consider
changing the subject matter of your shows.

62
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:55,034
It is just a puppet show.
The children like it as it is.

63
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,000
Well...

64
00:08:56,411 --> 00:09:00,415
Thank you very much.
Goodnight, Mrs. Toulon...

65
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,500
... and goodnight to you.

66
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,795
Fellow puppeteer.

67
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Good night.

68
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,000
My god.

69
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:28,568
Just a young man, I assure you.

70
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,653
He wanted to frighten me.

71
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,782
He didn't. I think he was impressed with my work.

72
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:38,995
For all the wrong reasons.
Lieutenant Stein could be a real
problem, my darling.

73
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:43,583
Not if we don't show fear.

74
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:57,180
Come on my friends.
Time for dinner.

75
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:08,733
You gave quite a performance tonight.

76
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:24,165
How come you always manage to be
first in line for dinner, eh?

77
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You have such a big appetite.

78
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:36,135
You could easily be the first in line
if you wanted to, because you are
bigger than anybody else.

79
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But you're not a bully-boy, are you?

80
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:56,114
And you, always laughing about everything,
always joking as a friend of mine would say.

81
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:06,000
And for you, well, life is just
one big battle for you, isn't it?

82
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, and
you are happy as a sandboy.

83
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:08,645
You know, Elsa, for years I have been
trying to paint you a portrait.

84
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,188
Oh, Andre, you didn't.

85
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:15,401
No, no, no. Every time I tried, you
finished up looking like my mother.

86
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,530
I'm hopeless with canvass and paint.

87
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Oh, Andre.

88
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,500
It's beautiful.

89
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,000
She is the image of you.

90
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Oh, darling.

91
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,798
What have I done to deserve you?

92
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You didn't do anything.

93
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,469
Experienced men are very sexy.

94
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:46,683
Sometimes, I think my life began
when I met you...

95
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:50,561
... and now I would die without you.

96
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,524
I'm never going to leave you. Never.

97
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:10,957
The show itself is a disgusting
burlesque of the Fuehrer and makes
a mockery of the Reich.

98
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:21,509
Yes. Have the men ready to leave immediately.

99
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,500
Sir, there is something else.

100
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,000
Yes?

101
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,976
Lieutenant, what is this?

102
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:37,650
I may be wrong but it seems as though
these wooden figures are walking about
on their own.

103
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:41,529
You're not mistaken, sir.

104
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Well...

105
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,459
Explain this.

106
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,544
I really can't, sir.

107
00:13:56,711 --> 00:14:01,758
Mr. Toulon has developed a method of animating
his puppets without string.

108
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,886
He claimed they were motorized,
but it's much more than that.

109
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:08,014
I've seen them walk.

110
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:13,227
React to sound as if they could hear.

111
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,500
It's as if they were alive.

112
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,000
Stein...

113
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,740
... have you lost your senses?

114
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:28,868
It's the truth, sir.

115
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,788
In the pictures.

116
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:35,124
Well, Krauss, I must speak to Toulon
before the Gestapo does.

117
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,210
Impossible.

118
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,838
Have the car brought around.

119
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I never take things at face value...

120
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:47,637
... but if Stein is even half-right,
this could be very important to my work.

121
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:51,808
If Toulon has the information,
I will get it for you, doctor.

122
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,936
Oh, yes, yes. And you'll end up killing him,
and we'll learn nothing.

123
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:59,107
You have an obligation
to the Deathcore Project too.

124
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:04,487
I have an obligation to expose
the dissident and to silence him!

125
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
If Toulon can be of use,
I'll take that under consideration.

126
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,217
Get me General Mueller.

127
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,302
It's doctor Hess.

128
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,347
Yes, it's urgent.

129
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,157
Mueller, yes?

130
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:55,163
I'm sorry to bother you, General, but we have a matter
brewing that might delay the progress of
the Deathcore Project indefinitely.

131
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:02,003
We need to talk to a puppeteer named
Andre Toulon who can assist us.

132
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:08,968
No, I understand, you need to speak to Toulon
before Krauss clubbers him up in his torture chamber.

133
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,053
Put him on.

134
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,807
It's General Mueller for you.

135
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yes?

136
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:28,529
Major, I want you to cooperate
with doctor Hess completely,
and that's an order...

137
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,908
... and I don't want
this kind of call again.

138
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm tired of separating you two
like fighting schoolboys.

139
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Yes, sir, General.

140
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:47,000
My only request is that ...
... you let my men do the job.

141
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Do not interfere.

142
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
We wouldn't want to see you injured, Hess.

143
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,445
Just like the real thing, huh?

144
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:13,199
Only more intelligent.

145
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,787
This theatre is closed...

146
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:22,375
... by the authority of the German High Command.

147
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:34,470
Your career as an entertainer is over,
Mr. Toulon.

148
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:38,849
This is one of the puppets
I was telling you about.

149
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,000
Doctor?

150
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,000
Mr. Toulon...

151
00:17:55,491 --> 00:18:00,997
... I would like to talk to you later
about your work.

152
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:08,796
And here's... the miracle, yes?

153
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,000
That's what I saw, yes.

154
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,050
That shouldn't be difficult to analyze.

155
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,178
All we need is the process.

156
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:20,349
- Mr. Toulon, would you work with me when...
- No!

157
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,435
Elsa, Elsa.

158
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,563
Take what you want, you bastards,
and get out of here.

159
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,605
That would be you, puppeteer.

160
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,484
Oh my god, what have they done.

161
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,904
Put him in the second car,
and take him to Gestapo headquarters.

162
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,500
I'm not leaving my wife.

163
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,000
Elsa, my darling.

164
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,161
I'll call for an ambulance.
Get him out of here!

165
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:43,289
You'll be all right, I promise you.
You'll be all right.

166
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,500
Leave me alone, damn you
filthy murdering swine.

167
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,755
And put the toys in with the toy-maker.

168
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Elsa!

169
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:21,827
I believe it's time to
get back to work, doctor.

170
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:47,937
My god, Krauss, that wasn't necessary.

171
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:51,232
You got what you needed.

172
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,328
And this will solve all your problems, doctor?

173
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:50,499
If the pictures are correct,
I know it will be of use.

174
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:55,713
But a great deal depends on Toulon
sharing his secret.

175
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:02,720
I'm under orders as well, and...
the higher authority wants
a demonstration of your results... yesterday.

176
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:09,810
I'll get with Toulon...
as soon as Major Krauss makes it possible.

177
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:02,446
You should have waited to kill the woman.
We need this man's cooperation.

178
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:06,075
It was stupid of you, Krauss.
Unworthy of you.

179
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:14,917
General, I don't see the death of
the Jew woman as a problem.

180
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,000
Yes?

181
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
They're both sitting in front of me now.

182
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,500
I see.

183
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,000
Thank you.

184
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:35,896
You ought to be congratulated, Krauss.
Mr. Toulon has escaped your custody.

185
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,500
Hurry.

186
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
All clear, Major.

187
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:23,444
I want a thorough search
of the living quarters.

188
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,500
- Nothing.
- Get out.

189
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Major, we have looked everywhere
and found nothing.

190
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
All right.

191
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:43,649
- Burn it.
- Yes, sir, Major.

192
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
- Search every building within
a five-block radius.
- Yes, sir.

193
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:06,375
Mr. Toulon, you... are a genius.

194
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
"Pharmacy"

195
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:56,967
Leeches. You suck our life's blood away.

196
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:04,349
Elsa... Oh god.

197
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:15,315
No thing must stop me from seeking you out and making
each one of you to your knees for what you have done.
And you will cry me "mercy," and I will have none.

198
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:32,210
No mercy, my friends. No mercy.

199
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:30,639
What are you doing?!

200
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Guard! Guard!

201
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Report to the morgue! Hurry!

202
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:35,495
Elsa, this is the best I can do for you now.

203
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Elsa.

204
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:38,016
But you can still revenge yourself.

205
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,334
I'll be one hour. Take the car
to be serviced, then return here...

206
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,000
... and, Erich, expect to be out all night.

207
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,500
Yes, sir.

208
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:32,570
Have the car ready.
Have yourself ready.

209
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:38,159
Have your ass-hole ready.

210
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I don't believe it.

211
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:40,930
Good night, fellow puppeteer.

212
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,869
This is excellent, Major.

213
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:04,954
This is nothing. There is no progress here.

214
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,957
Open your eyes, will you?

215
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:12,463
That is true he remained animate
for just a few minutes.

216
00:36:12,463 --> 00:36:15,548
There was no sign of violent rage this time.

217
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:19,552
This subject could be controlled from the field.

218
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:25,809
He was in a suicidal state, so he simply
related back to his before-death behaviour.

219
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:29,979
Give me a soldier who is
killed by the enemy in battle...

220
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:34,234
... and the results will be very different.

221
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,571
Toulon's genius is at work.

222
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,449
I need to speak to that man, Krauss.

223
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,160
And so do I.

224
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,389
You're not my driver.

225
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,474
Where's Lieutenant Stein?

226
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,561
Dead, sir.

227
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Oh my god.

228
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:19,903
- You're saying that no one saw
him leaving, nothing at all?
- No, sir. I found him and contacted headquarters.

229
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:26,453
Have the body removed
and send the report back to me.

230
00:37:37,136 --> 00:37:40,849
Sergeant!

231
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
This is exactly what we found
at the marionette theatre.

232
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:09,037
This is Toulon's,
isn't it, Major?

233
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:25,970
I want every inch of this city searched.

234
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,849
Find him.

235
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:35,104
I don't care how many patrols it takes.

236
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:38,024
Find him!

237
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:17,855
Toulon, give yourself up.
We'll find you.

238
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:21,985
It will be worse for you, believe me.
Give up.

239
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
"Help the blind"

240
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:08,383
I think we will be safe here.

241
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:13,388
Tomorrow we start all over again.
Killing murderers in the middle of a war.

242
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:24,023
This is not enough, doctor.

243
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:27,151
We're almost there. If I can get to Toulon,
I know we can prolong the soldiers' new life...

244
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:32,699
... but I must get to him.

245
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:38,621
Reich's headquarters has informed us that
there's not enough time to wait for Toulon's recapture.

246
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:44,419
General, we are very close to finding him.

247
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:50,091
This toymaker, Major, managed to kill one of your men.
How is that possible?

248
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:53,000
An investigation is underway.
203.

249
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,400
Lieutenant Stein was very careless.

250
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:59,434
That seems to be a problem of yours,
doesn't it Krauss?

251
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:06,107
Now I don't want any more excuses.

252
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
The humiliation to me...

253
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I'd rather have you two shot
than be disgraced in Marshall Goering's eyes once again.

254
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:20,997
Now if you will excuse me,
I have a top-level meeting.

255
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:58,701
Now, be careful.
Mueller will be well-armed.

256
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Of course, so are you.

257
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I wish I could handle Goering
as well as I can handle you.

258
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:18,883
What is this joke?

259
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I am giving you fair warning...

260
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
... your place is in the lab...

261
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
... not with the Gestapo High Command.

262
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
We need Andre Toulon, Major.

263
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Yeah?

264
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Just a moment.

265
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Yes, Krauss here.

266
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
What happened?

267
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Oh my god.

268
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Yes, five minutes.

269
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
What?

270
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Mueller's been killed.

271
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I'm coming with you.

272
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
My friend, we will make
repairs on you very soon.

273
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,160
Mr. Toulon?

274
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:14,373
It's me, Peter Hertz.
Your puppet said I stole the candy, remember?

275
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,459
How did you find me?

276
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:21,881
By accident, Mr. Toulon.
Peter and I have been hiding in this cellar...

277
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
... for two days.

278
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:25,843
The Gestapo or the SS?

279
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,928
Gestapo.

280
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:33,142
I need a place to keep Peter
till I can get him to Switzerland.

281
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:35,227
We didn't know you were here,
Mr. Toulon, I swear it.

282
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:38,981
You won't give us away, will you?

283
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,526
I would be a fool if I did.

284
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,500
Now we're all fugitives together.

285
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,000
Yes, fugitives.

286
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,167
This is where it happened, yes?

287
00:47:58,334 --> 00:48:01,295
Look at the blood stains, Krauss.

288
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:06,509
The General was hit standing in the middle
of the hallway, then he fell.

289
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:11,013
And this... is the first bullet fired.

290
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,021
If the assassin fired and missed...

291
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:22,149
... why didn't Mueller shoot back, yeah?

292
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:26,153
I'm sure he did.

293
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:31,951
So why is there no body?

294
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Mueller could not have missed at such a close range.

295
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,371
I don't know.

296
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Excuse me.

297
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:43,254
I've never seen a bullet this small.

298
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:54,431
What is it, Hess?

299
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
My god...

300
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:04,483
... I should have known.

301
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:11,365
The Gestapo found out my wife
was originally from Warsaw.

302
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:17,413
So they came to our house and arrested her,
claiming she was a spy.

303
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:20,499
How did you escape?

304
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:26,755
We didn't. I came home just as they were taking her away.

305
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I found Peter hiding in the kitchen cupboard.

306
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Ah, here comes supper.
Good boy.

307
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:37,224
It's a picnic.

308
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:41,103
You like this, don't you, boy?

309
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:44,523
Yes, it's been a lot of fun, but...

310
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,609
... I'll be glad to go home.

311
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:50,000
Mother says she will be back soon,
and we'll all go to Switzerland together

312
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Yes, we all go... together.

313
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:59,121
10 000 marks for the information leading to Toulon's capture.

314
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:04,335
I want these posted all over the city within the hour.

315
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:09,548
When you find Toulon, you're going
to execute him, aren't you, Krauss?

316
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:13,719
Did you know that Toulon taught medicine in Paris?

317
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:16,847
Quite a background researching in chemistry.

318
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:20,976
I wonder why he gave it up?
Curious.

319
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:22,061
Answer me!

320
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:28,317
Yes, he will be executed immediately,
and it will be my good pleasure to fire the first bullet.

321
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,402
I won't allow it.

322
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:36,158
Andre Toulon is an enemy
of the Reich and of the New World Order.

323
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:44,291
When the tin gods are destroyed,
the new world will be rebuilt by geniuses like Andre Toulon.

324
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:50,422
Something you and I will never live to see, Krauss.

325
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:57,513
I know you won't, doctor...
... but until I get that order...

326
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:01,892
... you will continue the work. Guard!

327
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:07,940
Until Toulon is captured, I think it best
you work under proper supervision.

328
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:13,279
See that doctor Hess is escorted home.
Stay with him until you heard from me.

329
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,500
Heil Hitler.

330
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:43,392
You should be in bed.

331
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:47,313
I like to stay up late.

332
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,862
The way they move...
... it's magic, isn't it?

333
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:58,699
Yes...
... and they can live forever.

334
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,161
What happened to his arm?

335
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:04,246
He got hurt doing me a favour...

336
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:08,417
... and I can't get the parts
I need to make him a new arm.

337
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:11,545
However, he has five more.

338
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:17,801
I could get it.
Yes, I could go to your workshop,
with everything you need.

339
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:18,844
I'd be your assistant.

340
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:23,015
No, Peter, you stay here until your father
says it's safe for you to leave.

341
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:25,729
You could be my assistant,
and you look after my other puppets for me.

342
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
All right.

343
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
You know...

344
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,000
... that one looks a lot like the man that
came to see my mother the day she went away.

345
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,000
Quiet!

346
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:19,321
Sorry, Peter, now you go to bed and tomorrow
I'll put it on a special puppet show for you.

347
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:23,325
With the six-shooter?
With the six-shooter. Goodnight.
Goodnight.

348
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:44,346
Father, did you hear the soldier?

349
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:48,851
Yes, I did, Peter.
I want you to stay inside, out of sight.

350
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,688
Mr. Toulon kept me safe, and tomorrow
I get to be his assistant in his puppet show.

351
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:56,859
I want you to stay away from Mr. Toulon.

352
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:57,901
It's for your own good.

353
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:01,113
Now go to sleep.

354
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
"WANTED"

355
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:08,305
You wouldn't volunteer for
a medical experiment, would you?

356
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:13,018
No, no. I didn't think you would.

357
00:55:14,229 --> 00:55:18,440
Then... I must go out.

358
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:24,404
Well, come on. Follow me.

359
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:29,826
We don't want you getting
into trouble with Major Krauss.

360
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
It's all right, private.
I'll let you know when I want to escape.

361
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:57,521
Toulon must have kept a record.

362
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:05,237
You could at least help me find it.

363
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Thank you.

364
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:33,223
What do you think you're doing?

365
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
What are you doing here?

366
00:56:38,688 --> 00:56:42,524
Are these things for yourself?

367
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,000
You know...

368
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:58,999
... if you really want to help Mr. Toulon, Peter,
you'll tell me where he is.

369
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:03,962
All I want to do is talk to him...

370
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
... and if I see anything that's not right,
I will leave right away.

371
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:08,000
I am his assistant, you know.

372
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Yes, I know. You are a man of authority.

373
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
But I don't want to harm Mr. Toulon...

374
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
... because...

375
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
... I don't want you mad at me.

376
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I can't tell you exactly.

377
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
There.

378
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:59,267
Wait here. That's an order.

379
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:33,176
Mr. Toulon, I brought a friend.

380
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:36,304
Don't be afraid.
I'm doctor Hess, Mr. Toulon.

381
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:38,390
I remember you.

382
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:44,312
- I didn't come here to have you arrested.
- He promised me he only wanted to talk.

383
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:49,401
Peter, take these tools you bring
and clean them like a good assistant.

384
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:56,116
Sit.

385
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:04,458
Killing you would be no problem for me, doctor.

386
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,543
I know, I just wanted to speak with you.

387
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:12,758
Be careful what you say.
My friends are very sensitive.

388
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:16,970
I thought we could talk
doctor to doctor.

389
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:18,013
You have the wrong man.

390
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:21,141
You taught medicine in Paris.

391
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:24,269
Chemistry and anatomy were specialties.

392
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:27,397
The Gestapo does its homework.
I'm impressed.

393
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
To hell with the Gestapo!

394
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I came here on my own.

395
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:35,739
I've come to learn of your genius firsthand.

396
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:39,910
Your promise was incredible.
Why did you stop teaching?

397
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:44,080
After the war,
I couldn't stand the sight of blood.

398
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:49,503
So my skill in anatomy
took a different direction.

399
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:56,843
They're amazing.
What is their secret, please?

400
00:59:57,803 --> 01:00:03,892
It was given to me during a trip
I took to Egypt with Elsa 15 years ago.

401
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:06,146
It is ancient and very simple.

402
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
It is in the archives of every museum
on the continent, it will be found.

403
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:15,362
Not so. I have been working on a drug
for over a year to re-instil animation...

404
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:21,368
... and all I have is random movement at best.
And even then only for a few minutes.

405
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:31,002
But I look at your wooden creations,
and they are alive as you and I.

406
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:33,088
You had my serum?

407
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:36,216
Yes. Completely organic.

408
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:39,344
But I have used it but cannot duplicate
what you've done.

409
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:41,429
You didn't know your subjects, doctor.

410
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:45,600
When I call these puppets my friend,
it is no mere affectation.

411
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:49,229
I knew them in life.

412
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Hence, sight of them.

413
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:57,279
The book-keeper. Very funny. Full of tricks and practical jokes.

414
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,198
Shot by the Nazis.

415
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:07,497
Herman Strauss, truck driver.
Executed for smuggling food to the Jewish ghetto.

416
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:11,918
And Elsa. You were there when they took her from me.

417
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Yes.

418
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:18,967
But what gives them life?

419
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:20,000
The will to live.

420
01:01:20,262 --> 01:01:22,351
I knew each of them before they
were cut down by the Nazis...

421
01:01:24,518 --> 01:01:28,479
... and they all wanted the same thing:
the chance to go on fighting.

422
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:33,359
That was the difference--they wanted this life after death.

423
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
They volunteered.

424
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:41,907
Yes. The secret of the new life
cannot be duplicated in the laboratory.

425
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:45,118
It is the human spirit.

426
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:56,171
Oh. An Excellent likeness.

427
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:01,718
The reward is 10 000 marks.

428
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:07,599
I don't want your money.
If I show you where Toulon is hiding...

429
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:10,060
... all I want is freedom...

430
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:14,230
... for my wife and my son...

431
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:18,944
... so that we can leave Berlin and never return.

432
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:28,662
First show me where he is.

433
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:37,253
As good as new.

434
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Are you going to send one of
your puppets to visit me, Toulon?

435
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Not just now.

436
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:56,523
At some other time we could have worked together
and done great things.

437
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:15,709
What this means?

438
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:20,964
Doctor Hess went there almost an hour ago.
He wanted me to stand guard.

439
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:25,385
When you see Hess, shoot him.
That's an order.

440
01:03:26,387 --> 01:03:29,433
- Let me get my son.
- Make it fast.

441
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:50,160
Get away from my son.

442
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:54,330
Peter is safe, Hertz.
This is doctor Hess.

443
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,416
A friend.

444
01:03:56,583 --> 01:04:01,963
I don't care who he is.
Stand away from my son.

445
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Now!

446
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:08,928
... Peter, come to me.

447
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:12,057
- But father...
- Peter!

448
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:15,685
Go with your father, Peter.

449
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:27,655
- Who saw you coming here?
- No one.

450
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:51,679
- Father, no.
- Be quiet, Peter.

451
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:56,101
It's the only way we can be a family.

452
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,000
Quick.

453
01:04:58,103 --> 01:04:58,978
What about Toulon?

454
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:01,000
You don't understand.

455
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
We do what we must for mama.

456
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:19,000
Hands up!

457
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Come on!

458
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:41,833
- Come on! I'd rather see Krauss the butcher dead than you.
- I cannot.

459
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Hurry. Hurry.
Hurry. Hurry.

460
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Hurry. Hurry.

461
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:11,236
Come on, before they come
around the back way.

462
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:14,000
- Go. They're coming.
- Stop!

463
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:21,079
Around the block.
He can't be far.

464
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:42,767
What did you say to him?
Nothing, Major. I said nothing.

465
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:46,854
- He was warned, yes?
- No.
- He was warned, yes?
- I said nothing.

466
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:52,527
Father!
Go, Peter. Run! Run!

467
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Oh. He's done with.

468
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:48,500
Keep fighting.

469
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:51,000
Men like you need to survive.

470
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:02,615
Look my friends.
I got us home.

471
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:29,827
I will help you, puppet master.

472
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
My god.

473
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:27,069
Like looking into a mirror, is it not?

474
01:13:27,987 --> 01:13:34,285
Now you can see what a small man
you really are, Major Krauss.

475
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:39,000
Is this what your puppets are for?

476
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
For your temper tantrums?

477
01:13:42,457 --> 01:13:44,544
You think I'm afraid of this?

478
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:55,139
You will be afraid.

479
01:15:42,496 --> 01:15:45,833
No, Toulon.

480
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
No!

481
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
No!

482
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
No!

483
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:20,761
Are you travelling alone, Major Krauss?
No.

484
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
She'll be boarding in a few minutes.

485
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:37,027
- Look, mother, dolls.
- Not dolls. Puppets.

486
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:41,198
I never heard of a boy playing
with dolls before.

487
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:43,284
Where are you and your son travelling?

488
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:46,412
- Switzerland.
- And then maybe to America.

489
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:48,497
Have you enjoyed Berlin?

490
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:53,000
No, I have not. I had very unpleasant experience.
I am recuperating.

491
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
I hope you're well now.

492
01:17:55,963 --> 01:17:59,717
Well, some people lost their heads,
but friends saw me through.

493
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:05,973
All aboard. The express to Geneva is leaving
from track number 7.
