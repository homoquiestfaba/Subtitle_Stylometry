Are you going to tell her daddy?

169
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:31,992
Are you gonna tell her,
that you used to touch me?

170
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:33,452
Don't you say that.

[screaming] Come on! Tell her!

172
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:36,246
That's a lie.

Oh man, what--

00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:16,078
She accused me, in front of
Blanche of molesting her.

185
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:18,455
Let me take a look.

186
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,210
[sighs] Oh man...

187
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,921
[groans in pain]

188
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,091
I don't think you
need stitches, but...

189
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:31,844
We should get you
into a doctor,

190
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:33,053
for some x-rays.

191
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:36,348
I'm not going to
leave my daughter alone.

192
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:40,602
You got anything
we can sedate Isabelle with?

193
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,230
I'm a veterinarian, Eli,
not a doctor.

194
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:44,690
Listen to me...

195
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,525
I don't have time for a doctor.

196
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:51,905
I have some horse tranquilizer.

197
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:53,532
Is it safe for people?

198
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:56,034
Well, it should be.

199
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:00,163
If this ever leaves this room,

200
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:02,332
they'd yank my
license so fast...

201
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,461
You have nothing to be
worried about, Doc. okay?

202
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:09,715
Okay. well...

203
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:13,427
I guess it's time we gave your
daughter, a little prick.

204
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:20,392
Are you ready?

205
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:26,440
-[door unlocks]
-Isabelle honey

206
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:28,400
It's daddy.

207
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,485
And look I brought a friend.

208
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:33,197
It's doctor Mcall,
do you remember him?

209
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:36,116
[eerie music]

210
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:41,413
He took care of your horses,
since you were a little girl.

211
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,710
He's like family,
he came to say Hi.

212
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:49,296
[Eli] You remember doctor Mcall?

213
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:52,132
Hello there, Izzy.

214
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:56,261
Izzidabell, remember? That's
what I called you.

215
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,389
I was out here
looking at your Phillies.

216
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:02,100
They're nice, you
got a favorite?

217
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,062
[tense music]

218
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:08,357
No?

219
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:13,153
Well, uhm...

220
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:14,780
Look we need to...

221
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:17,533
Have you get back on your feet.

222
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,244
Give me your hand.

223
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:23,664
There you go. We'll get you to
get some rest, okay?

224
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:26,667
Let's just count back
from ten, okay?

225
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,126
[doctor groans in pain]

226
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:30,212
Isabelle, don't! Doc!

227
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,298
-[Eli screaming]
-[doctor groaning]

228
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:42,516
[sarcastic laughter]

229
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:02,494
Doc?

230
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:04,746
Blanche.

231
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,875
What happened?

232
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:11,587
[crying] I don't know.

233
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:14,173
That's not my daughter in there.

234
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:17,342
That's not the daughter I know.

235
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:19,636
[crying continues]

236
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:28,854
What are you doing?

237
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,234
I just came by to see
if you needed some help.

238
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:35,694
I do, I need it here.

239
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:41,825
[church music]

240
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:09,686
[suspenseful music]

241
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:33,585
[strange voice]

242
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:56,525
-[soft guitar music]
-[horse neighing]

243
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:20,215
How long she's been
acting like this?

244
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:22,217
I don't know.

245
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:24,761
She's been having
some troubles lately.

246
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:30,809
This thing we saw today,
no one knows what to do.

247
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,811
[tense music]

248
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:02,466
Migel!

249
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:15,604
Hello, Señor Barber.

250
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,731
[sniffles]

251
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:21,193
[Ely] Migel, now is not
a good time for me.

252
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:23,320
I've got a family crisis
going on.

253
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:25,364
Yes, I understand.

254
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:29,868
You'll get your pay on Friday.

255
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:32,412
I must see your daughter.

256
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:33,914
Why?

257
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,084
Please...

258
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:39,670
I must see her.

259
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:44,007
How is it that you think
you can help my daughter.

260
00:23:45,217 --> 00:23:47,094
I have seen this kind
of thing before.

261
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:51,723
[suspenseful music]

262
00:23:58,105 --> 00:24:00,274
You've come to touch
me again daddy?

263
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:04,403
Isabelle... Isabelle,
please don't say that.

264
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:07,781
Daddy, I'm so horny.

265
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:10,534
Come to me the way you like it.

266
00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:13,495
Both of you.

267
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:16,290
-Leave now, Mr Barber.
-No.

268
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:17,624
[Eli] I'm not leaving
you alone with her,

269
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,293
Not when she's acting like this.

270
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:20,377
-Get out!
-No.

271
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:22,171
[screaming] Get out!

272
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:33,140
[tense music]

273
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:55,913
So you know Psalms 65.

274
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:01,168
[deep voice] Psalms 67!

275
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:10,260
[praying in Spanish]

276
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:16,475
[Tense music continues]

277
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:06,692
[Blanche sighs]

278
00:26:07,943 --> 00:26:08,944
[footsteps]

279
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,573
She's sleeping now.

280
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:15,534
She's okay?

281
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:21,123
Does your daughter speak Latin?

282
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:23,876
No, no way.

283
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:25,627
Why are you asking?

284
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:28,505
You don't need a doctor.

285
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:30,174
Just a priest.

286
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:34,928
-[eerie music]
-[birds chirping]

287
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:10,756
Let me take your coat.

288
00:27:11,006 --> 00:27:12,049
Thank you.

289
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:14,635
Can I get you
some coffee or tea?

290
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:17,346
Some tea would be good.
Some milk and sugar.

291
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:19,681
Three, if it's no problem.

292
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:22,309
[Blanche] It's not
a problem at all.

293
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,852
I'll be right back.

294
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:28,815
Don't worry about doctor Mcall.

295
00:27:29,358 --> 00:27:30,817
He's sleeping off a Bender.

296
00:27:32,194 --> 00:27:33,946
Look, I'm not gonna
bother with mall talk

297
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:35,781
What's going on here?

298
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:37,491
Sit down.

299
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:47,042
Isabelle is going crazy.

300
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:53,382
One minute she's winning
the question trophies,

301
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:55,592
and getting ready for her prom.

302
00:27:57,511 --> 00:27:58,846
And the next minute...

303
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,975
She’s gutting wild animals
with her bare hands...

304
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:06,520
And asking me...

305
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:08,605
To touch her.

306
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:13,068
-Have you been to see a doctor?
-[Eli] You wanna see the list?

307
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,779
It's as long as
your arm, father.

308
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:20,492
She keeps getting worse.

309
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:23,620
So you were Blanche's idea?

310
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,206
Personally...

311
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:30,669
You'd be the last guy I would
ever invite to this dance.

312
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,756
You've caused my family
enough grief.

313
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:37,176
Let's keep this about Isabelle.

314
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,553
Alright.

315
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:43,599
Now, are we talking
about possession?

316
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:45,893
Maybe.

317
00:28:46,977 --> 00:28:48,270
I don't know anything

318
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:50,856
until we conduct
a proper evaluation.

319
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:55,611
I don't give two shits
about your diagnosis.

320
00:28:58,197 --> 00:28:59,656
I want my baby back. [cries]

321
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:01,742
Please bring my daughter back.

322
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:25,265
Jacob...Is that you?

323
00:29:27,893 --> 00:29:29,228
Yes.

324
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:33,899
Nice costume.

325
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:37,861
How are you doing Belle?

326
00:29:38,487 --> 00:29:41,031
I don't understand why they're
treating me like this.

327
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:45,077
I haven't done anything wrong.

328
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:47,621
They're saying you're dangerous.

329
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:49,039
[tense music]

330
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:52,584
Dangerous to yourself
and to others.

331
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:04,012
I've missed you Jacob.

332
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,230
I never told anybody.

333
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:19,236
About what?

334
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,656
[Jacob] Whoa.

335
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:24,741
[chuckles]

336
00:30:26,285 --> 00:30:27,369
Sorry Isabelle.

337
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:29,037
It's Ok, Jacob.

338
00:30:30,873 --> 00:30:32,457
I didn't mean to...

339
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:47,472
You like what you see?

340
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:53,270
You're a very beautiful
girl Isabelle.

341
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:55,814
It's lonely in here.

342
00:30:57,608 --> 00:30:58,817
Do you want to join me?

343
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,909
Nobody needs to know
our little secret.

344
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,463
I want you.

345
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:22,007
[moans]

346
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:38,482
Lord, have mercy
on you, Isabelle!

347
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:49,785
[praying] Lord, have mercy
on this innocent child.

348
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:54,790
[laughs]

349
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:19,523
I don't know
how to tell you this.

350
00:32:19,857 --> 00:32:22,526
-Cause' I don't--
-Just spit it out.

351
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:25,279
I think an exorcism might
be in order here.

352
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:27,990
I knew it. She's possessed.

353
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:30,868
Blanche...please.

354
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:34,955
Are you telling me,
the devil's in my daughter?

355
00:32:35,664 --> 00:32:37,124
Not Satan himself.

356
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:39,751
But it is a demon of some kind.

357
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:42,838
She's showing all the signs.

358
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:44,798
So what do we do now?

359
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:46,925
I need to make a call.

360
00:32:47,217 --> 00:32:48,635
[phone ringing]

361
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:56,894
We have an emergency.

362
00:32:58,061 --> 00:32:59,188
Jacob?

363
00:33:00,314 --> 00:33:02,983
The young girl Isabelle,
she is showing all the signs.

364
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:04,735
What are you talking about?

365
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:06,695
I'm talking about possession.

366
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:08,780
She's displaying
supernatural strength.

367
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,115
She's fluent in Latin,

368
00:33:10,282 --> 00:33:12,701
and speaking in a voice...
It's a terrible voice.

369
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:14,453
It's not the voice
of a young woman

370
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:16,496
Alright Jacob look, calm down.

371
00:33:16,872 --> 00:33:19,625
Father, I need help
out here, immediately.

372
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:22,377
[whispering]
I'm not ready for this.

373
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:24,671
Jacob listen to me, If what
you say is true,

374
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:27,841
I need to call Cardinal Bennett
first thing in the morning.

375
00:33:28,217 --> 00:33:29,760
He's the only one
that could possibly--

376
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:30,969
[electric shock]

377
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:44,399
[soft music]

378
00:34:32,114 --> 00:34:33,156
How's Isabelle doing?

379
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:37,369
I don't know.

380
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:40,706
How's Blanche holding up?

381
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:42,666
She's hanging in there.

382
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:44,668
-look...
-[sighs]

383
00:34:44,877 --> 00:34:47,379
If there's anything
I can do to help.

384
00:34:47,796 --> 00:34:48,797
[Eli[ Look?

385
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:51,633
Why are you so interested
in my wife's welfare!?

386
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:55,053
I've seen the way you look at
her, the way you touch her...

387
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:57,514
Don't play me for a fool, Luke.

388
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:58,849
I'll beat your--

389
00:34:59,141 --> 00:35:00,851
Get your hands off me!

390
00:35:00,934 --> 00:35:04,354
-You got it all wrong, Eli.
-Do I?

391
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:07,232
Blanche is a lovely lady,
no question.

392
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,695
But I'm in love with
your daughter.

393
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:17,618
My daughter?

394
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:19,328
Isabelle.

395
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:22,873
I love her Eli.

396
00:35:23,415 --> 00:35:24,750
Have you touched her?

397
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:26,668
Have you been with her?
Is she still a virgin?

398
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:28,462
-That's none of your business!
-The hell it's not,

399
00:35:28,587 --> 00:35:31,048
[yelling] She's barely 18!

400
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:32,174
-[smack]
-[grunts]

401
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:41,016
I know you've been going through
a tough time lately, boss.

402
00:35:45,187 --> 00:35:47,523
But don't you ever
do that again.

403
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,777
I'm sorry, alright?

404
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:53,987
-[tense music]
-I understand.

405
00:35:56,657 --> 00:35:57,783
I forgive you.

406
00:35:59,076 --> 00:36:00,285
She is my baby.

407
00:36:02,162 --> 00:36:05,123
She's the baby of my family.

408
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,378
She'll be alright.

409
00:36:11,046 --> 00:36:12,506
Mark my words.

410
00:36:14,508 --> 00:36:16,301
Yeah, well I hope you're right.

411
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:22,558
As far as Blanche's concern...

412
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:25,769
you're lucky to have her.

413
00:36:26,478 --> 00:36:28,438
Even though you
treat her like dirt.

414
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:31,108
[yelling] Hey, I am true to her!

415
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:34,152
But do you love her?

416
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:47,499
The phone's down.

417
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,169
But I did manage
to reach the bishop.

418
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:52,629
He's gonna consult
with the Vatican

419
00:36:52,713 --> 00:36:54,256
before we can do anything.

420
00:36:55,007 --> 00:36:56,633
Come on Jacob!

421
00:36:56,884 --> 00:36:58,427
You can do better than that.

422
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:01,305
My Belle is dying in there.

423
00:37:01,555 --> 00:37:02,556
Sorry Blanche.

424
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:04,766
Until I get permission
from the bishop,

425
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:06,393
my hands are tied.

426
00:37:07,936 --> 00:37:10,147
With no phone,
I can't receive any calls.

427
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,773
I have to get back
to the church.

428
00:37:12,691 --> 00:37:15,527
I don't have a good
feeling about this.

429
00:37:16,987 --> 00:37:18,906
Please? Stay.

430
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,575
The best thing you can do
is check her

431
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:22,993
into a psychiatric hospital.

432
00:37:23,994 --> 00:37:25,746
I'll call you when I know more.

433
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:31,084
I wish I could do more Blanche.

434
00:37:32,961 --> 00:37:34,296
I'm sorry.

435
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:37,508
Goodnight.

436
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,594
You know I've been disappointed
in you before Jacob.

437
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:43,680
I guess I'm just getting
used to it.

438
00:38:21,343 --> 00:38:22,636
What are you doing?

439
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,389
You're not leaving
until you help Isabelle.

440
00:38:25,514 --> 00:38:26,640
I already told Blanche,

441
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:29,810
I can't do anything until
I talk to the Vatican.

442
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:32,521
[yelling]
The Vatican can go to hell.

443
00:38:33,355 --> 00:38:36,275
Put that white collar to use and
get the devil outta Isabelle.

444
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:38,068
I don't even have what I need.

445
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:41,613
[Luke] Improvise.

446
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:43,490
[horse neighing]

447
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:34,583
[suspenseful music]

448
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:06,657
[Jacob] I can't do anything with
you pointing that gun at me.

449
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:09,660
You want to help
Isabelle or not?

450
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,372
Go back inside and wait.

451
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:16,959
I need to speak to Miguel,
on my own.

452
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:24,675
[Luke] Don't disappoint me,padre.

453
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:29,429
Meantime... I'm gonna
hold on to these.

454
00:40:49,825 --> 00:40:51,034
Migel?

455
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:55,163
[heavy breathing]

456
00:40:57,958 --> 00:40:58,959
I'm Jacop.

457
00:41:00,669 --> 00:41:01,879
I know who you are.

458
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,257
What do you want?

459
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:07,301
Blanche.

460
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:10,304
You told her,
she needed a priest.

461
00:41:12,097 --> 00:41:14,266
[suspenseful music]

462
00:41:33,118 --> 00:41:34,161
-Get back!
-[screams]

463
00:41:35,787 --> 00:41:36,830
Claire.

464
00:41:38,624 --> 00:41:40,042
I didn't mean to scare you.

465
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:42,211
What are you doing
with that gun?

466
00:41:45,672 --> 00:41:46,673
Nothing,

467
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:48,509
Long story.

468
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:50,552
Dad!

469
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:52,763
What's going on?

470
00:41:53,055 --> 00:41:54,056
[sighs]

471
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:57,392
Come inside.

472
00:41:59,728 --> 00:42:01,522
What do you know about exorcism
Migel?

473
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:04,525
-Not much.
-How much?

474
00:42:06,777 --> 00:42:08,237
I saw one.

475
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:11,240
Long time ago.

476
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:13,784
What happened?

477
00:42:14,952 --> 00:42:19,164
He was an old man...
The demon was inside him.

478
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:22,626
Was it successful?

479
00:42:23,544 --> 00:42:25,170
[horse neighing
in the background]

480
00:42:25,963 --> 00:42:27,339
We did what we could.

481
00:42:28,465 --> 00:42:29,508
But it wasn't enough.

482
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,718
The old man died
of a heart attack.

483
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:39,601
Who led the ritual?

484
00:42:41,311 --> 00:42:42,396
I did.

485
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:56,243
Mom?

486
00:42:56,743 --> 00:42:57,911
[soft music]

487
00:43:01,123 --> 00:43:02,124
Sweetheart!

488
00:43:08,964 --> 00:43:10,966
Claire what are you doing here?

489
00:43:12,843 --> 00:43:14,636
I don't know, I couldn't sleep.

490
00:43:14,803 --> 00:43:18,390
I was having terrible dreams,
and nightmares about Isabelle.

491
00:43:18,515 --> 00:43:19,600
I can't explain it.

492
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:26,023
I got worried, and I was
calling over here,

493
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:28,317
and I couldn't get through
so I drove over.

494
00:43:29,067 --> 00:43:30,110
Where is your car?

495
00:43:31,486 --> 00:43:32,821
I had a friend drive me.

496
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:34,323
Where is Isabelle?

497
00:43:35,657 --> 00:43:37,284
What's going on?

498
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:39,328
I think you should tell her.

499
00:43:40,621 --> 00:43:42,456
Your sister is very sick Claire.

500
00:44:03,268 --> 00:44:05,854
It's a part of a life
I left behind a long time ago.

501
00:44:06,897 --> 00:44:09,566
You don't want me in that room,
that I can promise you.

502
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,276
I need you help, Miguel.

503
00:44:11,568 --> 00:44:12,694
I can't do this alone.

504
00:44:12,778 --> 00:44:15,447
You're the only one here that
has done anything like this.

505
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,703
Jacop's here? Now?

506
00:44:22,329 --> 00:44:23,830
The padre is here.

507
00:44:24,498 --> 00:44:26,500
Down at the bunkhouse,
talking to Miguel.

508
00:44:27,584 --> 00:44:30,629
Blanche...
you need to get some rest.

509
00:44:30,879 --> 00:44:32,548
We've got things
under control here.

510
00:44:33,549 --> 00:44:35,467
I guess a few winks
isn't going to hurt.

511
00:44:37,094 --> 00:44:38,720
Wake me if I can do anything.

512
00:44:39,513 --> 00:44:40,514
[Eli] We will.

513
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:47,437
Do you trust me?

514
00:44:49,022 --> 00:44:50,023
Why should I?

515
00:44:51,108 --> 00:44:53,360
If you have any faith in our
lord Jesus Christ,

516
00:44:53,443 --> 00:44:56,029
you have to do everything you
can to help Isabelle.

517
00:44:57,573 --> 00:44:59,366
I’m sorry, but I want
no part of it.

518
00:44:59,741 --> 00:45:01,285
Why? I don't understand.

519
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:02,870
Why?

520
00:45:04,288 --> 00:45:06,665
To perform an exorcism
you have to be strong.

521
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:10,419
You have to be free
of guilt or sin.

522
00:45:11,128 --> 00:45:13,338
The demon will use your
weaknesses against you.

523
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:16,717
Are you prepared Jacop? Are
you ready for that?

524
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,801
I'll make do.

525
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:25,017
I'd like to help you.

526
00:45:26,768 --> 00:45:28,520
But I no longer
believe in the church.

527
00:45:30,189 --> 00:45:31,982
What about our Lord
Jesus Christ?

528
00:45:35,485 --> 00:45:36,570
If there's a god...

529
00:45:38,447 --> 00:45:40,616
Then he’s punishing me
every goddamn day.

530
00:45:44,828 --> 00:45:46,580
[Claire] Are you sure
you're ok mom?

531
00:45:47,998 --> 00:45:48,999
[sighs]

532
00:45:49,124 --> 00:45:50,501
I'm fine honey.

533
00:45:52,794 --> 00:45:54,505
Tell me what's really going on.

534
00:45:56,256 --> 00:45:57,841
You really think she
is possessed?

535
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:01,887
That's not my baby daughter in
there, that's all I know.

536
00:46:02,888 --> 00:46:05,182
We'll figure it out. I promise.

537
00:46:05,974 --> 00:46:07,100
[sighs]

538
00:46:08,852 --> 00:46:10,771
Are you alright
with Jacop being here?

539
00:46:10,938 --> 00:46:12,022
[scoffs]

540
00:46:12,147 --> 00:46:13,148
I don't know.

541
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:18,153
If in any way he can help,
then of course, yeah, but...

542
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:19,738
I have my doubts.

543
00:46:20,614 --> 00:46:22,324
I just didn't know what
else to do.

544
00:46:22,991 --> 00:46:23,992
It's alright.

545
00:46:25,744 --> 00:46:26,954
Mom, get some rest, okay?

546
00:46:29,248 --> 00:46:30,415
Lot of rest.

547
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:36,755
[Miguel shouting] Wait!

548
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:44,513
I'll do it.

549
00:46:45,806 --> 00:46:48,934
But only for her, not for God.

550
00:46:49,685 --> 00:46:50,727
Just what I need.

551
00:46:51,353 --> 00:46:53,313
A priest who doesn't
believe in God.

552
00:46:53,981 --> 00:46:56,108
I have the Roman Ritual.

553
00:47:04,408 --> 00:47:05,409
Honey?

554
00:47:05,534 --> 00:47:06,535
[suspenseful music]

555
00:47:06,952 --> 00:47:08,370
Oh god...Isabelle?

556
00:47:10,163 --> 00:47:11,540

557
00:47:11,874 --> 00:47:13,166

What are you doing?

560
00:47:16,253 --> 00:47:17,546
Please let me help you.

561
00:47:18,463 --> 00:47:20,215
Give me you hand.
Let me help you.

562
00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:22,092
Isabelle please!

563
00:47:28,182 --> 00:47:30,642
"Dear Blanche,
please meet me privately.

564
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:33,520
I need to talk to you.
Please don't mention to Eli."

565
00:47:38,734 --> 00:47:40,110
[deep sigh]

566
00:47:40,903 --> 00:47:42,404
[moaning]

567
00:47:52,664 --> 00:47:53,832
[moaning continues]

568
00:48:22,528 --> 00:48:23,612
Stop it!

569
00:48:23,904 --> 00:48:26,156
[moaning]

570
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,241
Stop it!

571
00:48:27,324 --> 00:48:28,617
Give me those letters.

572
00:48:28,867 --> 00:48:30,285
Give me those letters!

573
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,291
Come on, Blanche.
One isn't enough.

574
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:20,377
[Blanche voiceless]
You had a hard day today.

575
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:23,172
A couple of more pills Isn't
gonna hurt you.

576
00:49:35,267 --> 00:49:37,936
[Blanche with strange voice]
Doesn't that feel better?

577
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,688
Come on, a few more!

578
00:49:57,039 --> 00:49:58,832
Very good!

579
00:50:00,501 --> 00:50:02,336
And now you can rest.

580
00:50:02,544 --> 00:50:04,713
Isabelle, It's daddy sugar.

581
00:50:05,047 --> 00:50:07,341
It's going to be Ok
I promise you.

582
00:50:07,758 --> 00:50:08,884
[hard smack]

583
00:51:07,651 --> 00:51:08,861
[clank]

584
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:11,488
[Isabelle grunting]

585
00:51:13,991 --> 00:51:16,785
Get that priest in here! Asap!

586
00:51:24,293 --> 00:51:27,004
Human teeth
are a chock full of bacteria.

587
00:51:29,923 --> 00:51:31,425
You ok Eli?

588
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:33,051
I'm not feeling that great doc.
.

589
00:51:34,511 --> 00:51:36,180
Yeah, I can't say I blame you.

590
00:51:36,847 --> 00:51:39,641
I'm surprised you haven’t gone
off the deep end yourself.

591
00:51:49,484 --> 00:51:50,944
I didn't know you were here.

592
00:51:51,278 --> 00:51:52,821
She's my sister, Jacob.

593
00:51:56,742 --> 00:51:59,203
We just had a little wrestling
match with Isabelle.

594
00:51:59,536 --> 00:52:01,288
What happened?

595
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:03,040
She bit my father.

596
00:52:03,707 --> 00:52:05,250
What are we going to do next?

597
00:52:05,709 --> 00:52:08,378
I've a got a plan but I'm gonna
need everybody's help.

598
00:52:11,048 --> 00:52:12,341
[Inspirational music]

599
00:52:12,424 --> 00:52:13,967
[Jacob] God's creature, salt,

600
00:52:14,051 --> 00:52:16,803
I cast out the demon
from you by the living, God,

601
00:52:16,929 --> 00:52:19,348
by the true, God,
by the holy, God.

602
00:52:19,556 --> 00:52:22,309
May you be a purified salt.

603
00:52:22,476 --> 00:52:24,520
May all evil fancies
of the foul fiend,

604
00:52:24,603 --> 00:52:25,812
his malice and cunning,

605
00:52:25,896 --> 00:52:28,774
be driven afar from the place
where you are sprinkled.

606
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:31,652
And let every unclean spirit
be repulsed by Him

607
00:52:31,735 --> 00:52:34,655
who is coming to judge both
the living and the dead

608
00:52:34,738 --> 00:52:36,573
and the world by fire.

609
00:52:37,032 --> 00:52:39,701
May this salt and water
be mixed together.

610
00:52:39,785 --> 00:52:41,453
In the name of the Father,

611
00:52:43,163 --> 00:52:44,873
and of the Son,

612
00:52:45,541 --> 00:52:47,000
and of the Holy Spirit.

613
00:52:47,584 --> 00:52:48,710
Amen.

614
00:52:49,169 --> 00:52:50,170
Amen.

615
00:52:59,763 --> 00:53:01,139
We've got to talk.

616
00:53:01,557 --> 00:53:03,267
It's about you and Doc.

617
00:53:03,392 --> 00:53:05,602
So if you could, I need
you to listen to me.

618
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:09,898
Blanche wake up.

619
00:53:10,399 --> 00:53:12,025
Blanche get up.

620
00:53:13,819 --> 00:53:14,862
Blanche?

621
00:53:17,322 --> 00:53:18,574
Blanche?

622
00:53:21,618 --> 00:53:24,121
Oh god Blanche.

623
00:53:24,454 --> 00:53:27,624
[screaming] Doc! Get in here
it's Blanche, hurry please!

624
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:29,835
[Eli] Oh god, Doc! I need you!

625
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:32,421
[Claire] What happened?

626
00:53:32,504 --> 00:53:37,676
[Eli] She swallowed a
bunch of pills! [repeating]

627
00:53:39,553 --> 00:53:40,762
Get her over here!

628
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:44,141
[All yelling]

629
00:53:52,524 --> 00:53:53,525
[vomiting]

630
00:53:57,154 --> 00:53:59,198
Good, that's my girl.

631
00:53:59,573 --> 00:54:00,741
[wolf howling]

632
00:54:05,245 --> 00:54:06,663
We're ready to begin.

633
00:54:06,872 --> 00:54:08,207
What else do you need?

634
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,167
A medical doctor present.

635
00:54:11,335 --> 00:54:13,587
Well I guess, I'm the best
you're gonna get.

636
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:15,214
A member of the family.

637
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:18,050
Blanche isn’t in
any shape to go.

638
00:54:19,635 --> 00:54:20,969
Claire, you do it.

639
00:54:22,012 --> 00:54:23,013
I can stay with mom.

640
00:54:24,431 --> 00:54:26,558
They'll need someone
way stronger than me.

641
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:29,353
I can assure you,
you're stronger than I am.

642
00:54:30,229 --> 00:54:31,271
Go.

643
00:54:31,438 --> 00:54:32,856
A female is preferred.

644
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:35,692
Alright.

645
00:54:36,068 --> 00:54:37,986
Good, now everyone
gather around.

646
00:54:40,572 --> 00:54:41,657
Now remember...

647
00:54:41,865 --> 00:54:43,200
It's very important,

648
00:54:43,283 --> 00:54:46,453
That no one has contact
with Isabelle,

649
00:54:46,537 --> 00:54:47,955
except from me.

650
00:54:48,747 --> 00:54:51,375
[chanting]

651
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:02,886
Now, we proceed
with the prayers of exorcism.

652
00:55:06,098 --> 00:55:07,391
Let's do it.

653
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:17,150
[tense music]

654
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:37,337
[sizzling sounds]
[yells in pain]

655
00:55:58,108 --> 00:56:00,861
I cast thee out, unclean spirit,
in the name of the Father,

656
00:56:00,944 --> 00:56:02,779
and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit.

657
00:56:02,863 --> 00:56:04,406
I command thee to name thyself.

658
00:56:04,489 --> 00:56:06,491
What is your number, demon?

659
00:56:13,582 --> 00:56:15,834
When will you leave
this poor creature of God?

660
00:56:16,502 --> 00:56:17,628
Never!

661
00:56:24,468 --> 00:56:26,595
[speaking with
deep strange voice]

662
00:57:04,424 --> 00:57:08,428
Almighty Lord,
Word of God the Father,

663
00:57:08,512 --> 00:57:10,764
Jesus Christ, God and Lord
of all creation.

664
00:57:11,014 --> 00:57:13,308
I humbly call on your
holy name in fear

665
00:57:13,392 --> 00:57:15,352
and trembling,
asking that you grant me,

666
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,603
your unworthy servant,

667
00:57:16,687 --> 00:57:19,439
the power to confront
with confidence and resolution

668
00:57:19,523 --> 00:57:20,941
this cruel demon.

669
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:23,652
See the cross of the lord.

670
00:57:25,779 --> 00:57:27,239
The stem of David,

671
00:57:27,322 --> 00:57:29,241
the lion of Juda's tribe
has conquered.

672
00:57:29,408 --> 00:57:33,620
-Lord, heed my prayer.
-And let my cry be heard by you.

673
00:57:34,162 --> 00:57:35,330
Let us pray.

674
00:57:35,414 --> 00:57:38,208
God and Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ,

675
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,002
I appeal to your holy name,

676
00:57:40,127 --> 00:57:41,920
humbly begging your kindness,

677
00:57:42,004 --> 00:57:43,547
that you graciously
grant me help

678
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:45,632
against this
and every unclean spirit

679
00:57:45,716 --> 00:57:47,718
now tormenting
this creature of yours.

680
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:49,219
through Christ our Lord.

681
00:57:49,428 --> 00:57:50,637
[both] Amen.

682
00:57:54,016 --> 00:57:55,017
[chuckling]

683
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:58,770
[demon's voice]
What about you, Miguel?

684
00:57:59,605 --> 00:58:01,440
What’s hiding in your closet?

685
00:58:04,026 --> 00:58:06,737
Which of the cardinal sins
do you employ?

686
00:58:08,113 --> 00:58:12,784
[incoherent talking with
a deep voice]

687
00:58:13,285 --> 00:58:16,872
You let your family die!

688
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,041
[shouting in Spanish]

689
00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:31,470
You're hurting Isabelle,
that's what the demon wants.

690
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:36,266
Doc! Doc! Get out!

691
00:59:08,549 --> 00:59:10,175
What happened to them Miguel?

692
00:59:10,259 --> 00:59:11,301
Nothing.

693
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,970
Don't lie to me.

694
00:59:13,887 --> 00:59:15,180
The demon got to you.

695
00:59:16,056 --> 00:59:17,391
[sobbing] No.

696
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:21,019
You said any guilt, shame
or weakness would be exploited.

697
00:59:25,858 --> 00:59:27,526
[crying]

698
00:59:32,698 --> 00:59:33,991
Confess to me.

699
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,743
They killed my family.

700
00:59:38,871 --> 00:59:40,497
[crying]
I came home one night...

701
00:59:41,623 --> 00:59:42,958
my mother...

702
00:59:44,209 --> 00:59:49,006
My father, my sister and her
two children.

703
00:59:49,423 --> 00:59:50,507
All dead.

704
00:59:50,674 --> 00:59:51,884
[crying continues]

705
00:59:54,469 --> 00:59:58,724
Each one...
shot in the back of the head.

706
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:02,019
Who did this?

707
01:00:02,477 --> 01:00:05,355
I’d been protesting
against the government.

708
01:00:08,233 --> 01:00:09,735
demanding better jobs,

709
01:00:10,569 --> 01:00:12,988
and medical care for the poor.

710
01:00:16,533 --> 01:00:17,993
My sister warned me...

711
01:00:18,911 --> 01:00:21,163
That I was stepping
on the wrong toes.

712
01:00:23,749 --> 01:00:25,709
That I was putting the
family in danger,

713
01:00:25,792 --> 01:00:27,252
but I didn't listen.

714
01:00:30,589 --> 01:00:32,216
I felt that my cause was just...

715
01:00:34,593 --> 01:00:35,844
And that God...

716
01:00:36,637 --> 01:00:39,306
would protect me and
my loved ones.

717
01:00:39,681 --> 01:00:41,099
[laughter]

718
01:00:41,683 --> 01:00:42,976
I'm sorry Miguel.

719
01:00:45,562 --> 01:00:47,147
You can't blame yourself
for this,

720
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:48,982
you didn’t perpetrate the crime.

721
01:00:49,066 --> 01:00:51,485
I might as well have pulled
the trigger my self.

722
01:00:51,944 --> 01:00:52,945
This is nonsense!

723
01:00:55,572 --> 01:00:57,991
Your church, did they help?

724
01:00:58,283 --> 01:00:59,284
[laughs]

725
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:01,954
They didn't do a damn thing.

726
01:01:08,126 --> 01:01:13,882
I knew if I stayed, I would die.

727
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:18,512
So I left.

728
01:01:21,932 --> 01:01:23,058
Like a coward.

729
01:01:24,518 --> 01:01:26,562
In the middle of the night.

730
01:01:28,188 --> 01:01:30,065
Any more questions, priest?

731
01:01:45,414 --> 01:01:47,165
Is what Isabelle said true?

732
01:01:49,042 --> 01:01:51,044
You left me because
you were afraid of me?

733
01:01:51,295 --> 01:01:52,296
[Jacob] No.

734
01:01:54,006 --> 01:01:56,300
It wasn't Isabelle talking.

735
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,803
It was the demon,
the demon can't be trusted.

736
01:02:00,596 --> 01:02:02,014
It's not all lies.

737
01:02:02,347 --> 01:02:03,849
Some of it is dead on.

738
01:02:04,474 --> 01:02:05,809
Claire I didn't say it
was all lies,

739
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:07,644
I said the demon
can't be trusted.

740
01:02:08,478 --> 01:02:10,105
Then why did you leave me Jacob?

741
01:02:10,814 --> 01:02:13,442
This isn't the right time
or the place, Claire.

742
01:02:13,692 --> 01:02:15,694
There's never a
right time or place.

743
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:20,824
I gotta get prepared
for the next session

744
01:02:21,158 --> 01:02:24,453
It's a simple question, Jacob!
Why did you leave?

745
01:02:26,246 --> 01:02:28,540
The demon was right
about one thing.

746
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:32,503
-I was afraid.
-Of what?

747
01:02:33,045 --> 01:02:34,463
Afraid of hurting you.

748
01:02:35,964 --> 01:02:38,383
You know
that I forgave you for that.

749
01:02:38,926 --> 01:02:41,678
Claire, I hit you,
I beat you.

750
01:02:44,348 --> 01:02:45,599
[sighs]

751
01:02:57,402 --> 01:03:01,156
I've had my arm
clear up to the shoulder

752
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,867
up an angry horses hooch.

753
01:03:04,201 --> 01:03:05,953
I thought I'd pretty much seen

754
01:03:06,036 --> 01:03:08,080
everything life can
throw at you.

755
01:03:09,248 --> 01:03:10,999
And now this stuff
with Izzy man...

756
01:03:11,458 --> 01:03:12,459
I know.

757
01:03:15,128 --> 01:03:17,589
How long's Betsy gone now?

758
01:03:21,218 --> 01:03:23,178
It's been going on
about two years now.

759
01:03:24,555 --> 01:03:25,931
Do you ever get lonely?

760
01:03:27,558 --> 01:03:28,559
Sure.

761
01:03:29,852 --> 01:03:32,062
That house gets awfully
quiet, you know?

762
01:03:33,105 --> 01:03:35,399
I thought about going
to one of those places,

763
01:03:35,482 --> 01:03:36,692
the Mustang ranch.

764
01:03:37,484 --> 01:03:39,695
Fella's got his needs, know
what I'm saying?

765
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:42,781
Well... That is what they're
there for, right Doc?

766
01:03:44,074 --> 01:03:45,117
Just cause the cow dies,

767
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,870
doesn't mean you gotta
put the bull out to pasture.

768
01:03:49,413 --> 01:03:50,497
I guess.

769
01:03:52,457 --> 01:03:55,043
I couldn't imagine myself
on those places.

770
01:03:55,586 --> 01:03:58,422
I would be
in confession, for years

771
01:03:58,505 --> 01:04:01,425
after trying to talk myself
out of that one.

772
01:04:02,009 --> 01:04:04,011
Well, where else is
a man your age

773
01:04:04,094 --> 01:04:06,346
gonna find himself a nice
woman, right Doc?

774
01:04:07,181 --> 01:04:09,099
There are plenty of fish
in the ocean.

775
01:04:10,184 --> 01:04:11,268
Don't get me wrong.

776
01:04:12,853 --> 01:04:14,605
It just occurred to me?

777
01:04:15,439 --> 01:04:16,857
You've know my Blanche...

778
01:04:17,691 --> 01:04:19,651
Almost as long as
I've known her.

779
01:04:21,528 --> 01:04:24,656
And you have gotten yourself
a mighty fine woman there Eli.

780
01:04:25,532 --> 01:04:26,575
A fine woman.

781
01:04:30,245 --> 01:04:32,789
Just how fine
would you say she is, Joe?

782
01:04:33,957 --> 01:04:35,459
She's very fine.

783
01:04:36,043 --> 01:04:38,545
I am not blind Joe.

784
01:04:39,546 --> 01:04:43,050
How long have you been
cheating with my wife?

785
01:04:45,177 --> 01:04:46,678
I would never.

786
01:04:47,721 --> 01:04:50,724
Confession is going to be
good for your soul.

787
01:04:51,433 --> 01:04:53,560
Now we better get it out
on the table

788
01:04:53,644 --> 01:04:56,063
right here and right now.

789
01:04:56,146 --> 01:04:57,940
Hey you've got it all wrong.

790
01:04:58,398 --> 01:05:00,567
Blanche is a very
attractive woman.

791
01:05:01,276 --> 01:05:05,739
-But I would never--
-That's bullshit.

792
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:07,950
Now you get your ass up,

793
01:05:08,575 --> 01:05:11,078
Don't you say a goddamn word.

794
01:05:11,787 --> 01:05:15,040
You and I are gonna go
for a little drive.

795
01:05:19,211 --> 01:05:20,337
Claire?

796
01:05:24,675 --> 01:05:26,093
Claire, if you can hear me...

797
01:05:29,221 --> 01:05:30,222
I'm sorry.

798
01:05:33,308 --> 01:05:35,727
I'm sorry, I've
always wanted to explain.

799
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:40,190
I couldn't...
It was painful.

800
01:05:43,318 --> 01:05:44,319
When I was a kid,

801
01:05:44,987 --> 01:05:45,988
my dad...

802
01:05:47,573 --> 01:05:49,324
he beat me around pretty good.

803
01:05:56,999 --> 01:05:58,083
I never told a soul.

804
01:05:59,001 --> 01:06:00,544
But I made a pact.

805
01:06:02,838 --> 01:06:04,715
I made a pact with my self.

806
01:06:06,508 --> 01:06:09,344
I swore that I would never
become him...

807
01:06:10,429 --> 01:06:12,806
But after that night
when I got drunk...

808
01:06:15,559 --> 01:06:16,560
I wasn't sure.

809
01:06:19,855 --> 01:06:21,106
So I ran.

810
01:06:23,984 --> 01:06:25,235
I bailed.

811
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,030
I did it for you, Claire.

812
01:06:36,872 --> 01:06:38,582
That's when I found
the priesthood.

813
01:06:55,098 --> 01:06:56,225
Please, forgive me.

814
01:07:09,446 --> 01:07:10,697
Turn it off.

815
01:07:13,951 --> 01:07:15,536
Don't kill me, Eli.

816
01:07:17,246 --> 01:07:18,830
It's very simple, Doc.

817
01:07:20,249 --> 01:07:21,792
You tell me the truth.

818
01:07:22,125 --> 01:07:23,168
What truth?

819
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:25,546
The real truth
or the truth you wanna hear?

820
01:07:25,879 --> 01:07:27,422
Because I didn't do it Eli!

821
01:07:28,882 --> 01:07:30,092
Confess it,

822
01:07:30,592 --> 01:07:33,053
and I will let you live.

823
01:07:55,909 --> 01:07:57,452
Don't fucking kill me.

824
01:08:04,168 --> 01:08:07,337
I slept with her,
is that what you wanna hear?

825
01:08:08,964 --> 01:08:09,965
[laughs]

826
01:08:12,843 --> 01:08:14,553
You don't get it, do you?

827
01:08:34,448 --> 01:08:35,866
I sleep with her.

828
01:08:37,576 --> 01:08:39,620
You had sex with her.

829
01:08:40,412 --> 01:08:41,705
That's what you did,

830
01:08:41,788 --> 01:08:44,833
you had sex with my wife.

831
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:46,335
I didn't.

832
01:08:47,461 --> 01:08:49,087
Man I didn't do it.

833
01:09:12,444 --> 01:09:13,445
[sighs]

834
01:09:13,946 --> 01:09:15,781
Well, old buddy...

835
01:09:15,948 --> 01:09:18,450
I think you're a filthy liar.

836
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:05,372
[gunshot]

837
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:14,798
Stop.

838
01:10:15,549 --> 01:10:17,342
You've got to be kidding me.

839
01:10:20,804 --> 01:10:22,014
I love you.

840
01:10:22,556 --> 01:10:24,308
I love you way too much.

841
01:10:25,517 --> 01:10:27,269
But this is wrong.

842
01:10:28,729 --> 01:10:32,149
I have tried everything
to show you that I love you

843
01:10:32,608 --> 01:10:35,027
But no matter what I do,
it's never enough.

844
01:10:35,485 --> 01:10:37,571
It's not you, it's me.

845
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:51,043
How many more ridiculous clichés

846
01:10:51,126 --> 01:10:52,461
can you spout Jacob?

847
01:10:52,544 --> 01:10:54,671
Let's just be friends,
how about that one?

848
01:10:55,339 --> 01:10:56,965
We're getting distracted.

849
01:10:57,257 --> 01:11:01,345
This demon is making us say
and do things we wouldn't do.

850
01:11:16,443 --> 01:11:17,444
[breathing heavily]

851
01:11:21,365 --> 01:11:23,158
This is so humiliating.

852
01:11:23,909 --> 01:11:26,954
I've risked everything for you.

853
01:11:29,831 --> 01:11:31,792
You hit me Jacob,
and I...

854
01:11:32,459 --> 01:11:33,752
Forgave you.

855
01:11:34,795 --> 01:11:36,421
Don't I deserve
something for that?

856
01:11:36,588 --> 01:11:37,589
Yes, you do.

857
01:11:39,258 --> 01:11:40,717
But not now.

858
01:11:42,177 --> 01:11:43,345
I've got to get back.

859
01:11:43,804 --> 01:11:45,347
We've got to save your sister.

860
01:11:47,432 --> 01:11:49,351
Go save Isabelle from the devil.

861
01:11:49,977 --> 01:11:51,436
We'll talk about this later.

862
01:11:51,979 --> 01:11:52,980
No.

863
01:11:53,313 --> 01:11:55,190
Enough talking,
I'm done talking.

864
01:11:55,399 --> 01:11:57,985
Claire I'm not going anywhere,
I'm not running away.

865
01:11:58,068 --> 01:11:59,236
Get out!

866
01:12:06,326 --> 01:12:07,828
Just get out!

867
01:12:19,298 --> 01:12:20,299
[breathing heavily]

868
01:12:30,934 --> 01:12:32,436
[suspenseful music]

869
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:41,570
Dear Joe,

870
01:12:41,695 --> 01:12:43,197
After Betsy’s passing,

871
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,241
and the tragic death
of your only child,

872
01:12:46,325 --> 01:12:47,367
it’s only normal

873
01:12:47,451 --> 01:12:50,454
that you would turn
to another woman for comfort.

874
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:53,457
Please don’t feel like
you’ve betrayed Eli,

875
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:56,168
by coming to me to talk.

876
01:12:57,336 --> 01:12:58,921
I’m glad I’ve been able
to be here

877
01:12:59,004 --> 01:13:00,255
for you as a friend.

878
01:13:01,006 --> 01:13:03,258
Eli should be proud to have...

879
01:13:03,467 --> 01:13:05,886
A friend who is so
honorable and loyal.

880
01:13:08,639 --> 01:13:10,224
Oh sweet god!

881
01:13:12,559 --> 01:13:14,311
[screaming] God, no!

882
01:13:19,483 --> 01:13:20,776
[gunshot]

883
01:13:33,372 --> 01:13:34,456
There he is.

884
01:13:35,249 --> 01:13:37,167
Back to rally the troops.

885
01:13:37,543 --> 01:13:38,669
Where is Eli?

886
01:13:39,378 --> 01:13:40,671
He took off in his truck.

887
01:13:41,588 --> 01:13:42,673
Hasn't come back.

888
01:13:43,215 --> 01:13:44,591
Maybe he went for help.

889
01:13:45,217 --> 01:13:47,344
More like rats
jumpin’ off a sinkin’ ship,

890
01:13:47,427 --> 01:13:48,470
if you ask me.

891
01:13:49,721 --> 01:13:51,974
Deserters usually
get shot in the back.

892
01:13:52,391 --> 01:13:55,269
Thought I was gonna have
to plug you earlier, Padre.

893
01:13:56,103 --> 01:13:57,688
But I gotta hand it to you.

894
01:13:58,188 --> 01:14:00,023
You hung in there
till the bitter end.

895
01:14:00,732 --> 01:14:01,900
We are not done yet.

896
01:14:04,903 --> 01:14:06,196
Come on we have work to do.

897
01:14:06,864 --> 01:14:08,824
Forget it. I'm done.

898
01:14:09,241 --> 01:14:10,367
He's right.

899
01:14:10,909 --> 01:14:11,910
It's over Jake.

900
01:14:12,828 --> 01:14:14,079
No, it's not over Luke.

901
01:14:14,162 --> 01:14:15,831
We're gonna see
this thing through.

902
01:14:16,415 --> 01:14:17,457
To the end.

903
01:14:17,958 --> 01:14:20,544
Whatever that thing is
that’s got a hold of Isabelle,

904
01:14:20,878 --> 01:14:22,004
it ain’t lettin’ go.

905
01:14:22,462 --> 01:14:25,007
We ain't got
a snowball’s chance fightin’ it.

906
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:26,633
That is not true.

907
01:14:27,885 --> 01:14:28,886
If we have faith--

908
01:14:29,344 --> 01:14:30,345
Faith?

909
01:14:32,389 --> 01:14:33,682
You haven't got shit.

910
01:14:34,641 --> 01:14:35,893
You two cowards

911
01:14:35,976 --> 01:14:37,644
are going to help me
save that girl,

912
01:14:37,769 --> 01:14:38,896
so help me God.

913
01:14:39,438 --> 01:14:41,064
-I'm not a coward.
-Yes, you are.

914
01:14:41,523 --> 01:14:43,609
And until you go back in there

915
01:14:43,692 --> 01:14:46,820
and help me
kick the crap out of that demon,

916
01:14:46,904 --> 01:14:48,530
you always be a coward.

917
01:14:48,655 --> 01:14:50,032
Back off, Padre.

918
01:14:58,373 --> 01:15:00,250
-I thought you loved Isabelle.
-I do.

919
01:15:00,334 --> 01:15:02,002
[shouting] Well, prove it!

920
01:15:29,071 --> 01:15:30,405
You’re going to need relics.

921
01:15:31,573 --> 01:15:33,033
I threw almost everything away.

922
01:15:33,951 --> 01:15:34,952
But I kept these.

923
01:15:37,496 --> 01:15:40,457
My grandfather...
gave them to me.

924
01:15:48,006 --> 01:15:49,132
She's gone.

925
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:02,271
[groans in pain]

926
01:16:18,662 --> 01:16:21,707
[tension music gains momentum]

927
01:16:41,476 --> 01:16:42,811
[yelling] Isabelle!

928
01:16:46,148 --> 01:16:47,399
Isabelle!

929
01:17:19,473 --> 01:17:20,974
Luke!

930
01:18:06,395 --> 01:18:08,689
I adjure you, ancient spirit,

931
01:18:14,611 --> 01:18:16,488
by the judge of the living
and the dead,

932
01:18:21,869 --> 01:18:24,663
by your Creator,
of the whole universe.

933
01:18:28,417 --> 01:18:33,255
By him who has the power to
consign you...

934
01:18:34,381 --> 01:18:35,924
To hell!

935
01:18:37,676 --> 01:18:42,806
Isabelle, who seeks refuge
in the fold of God!

936
01:18:45,267 --> 01:18:46,602
To depart forthwith...

937
01:18:47,394 --> 01:18:48,854
In fear.

938
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:51,565
Reveal yourself, demon!

939
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:56,111
I'm not afraid of you.

940
01:18:59,072 --> 01:19:00,073
[screams]

941
01:19:04,828 --> 01:19:08,415
Yield not to my person
but to the minister of Christ.

942
01:19:08,498 --> 01:19:11,168
For it is the power of Christ
that compels you.

943
01:19:19,468 --> 01:19:21,470
The Holy Ghost
commands you!

944
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:30,938
[demon's voice]
My name is Perloquus.

945
01:20:01,093 --> 01:20:02,511
[Jacob] Stay with her.

946
01:20:02,636 --> 01:20:04,596
Jacob! where are you going?

947
01:20:22,072 --> 01:20:24,199
[chants]

948
01:20:57,774 --> 01:20:59,484
I don't know what you're saying.

949
01:21:01,737 --> 01:21:03,280
When you came to the church...

950
01:21:03,822 --> 01:21:05,532
I didn’t think much of it,

951
01:21:05,908 --> 01:21:08,619
When you suddenly showed up,
in the middle of the night...

952
01:21:08,702 --> 01:21:10,329
you'd been hiding,

953
01:21:11,246 --> 01:21:14,124
waiting for me to be drown in.

954
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,210
You don't understand.

955
01:21:16,293 --> 01:21:18,670
I was desperate
to help Isabelle.

956
01:21:19,004 --> 01:21:20,589
I thought black
magic might help.

957
01:21:20,797 --> 01:21:22,341
You've been here the whole time,

958
01:21:23,008 --> 01:21:27,679
lingering, plotting,
setting up your trap.

959
01:21:30,349 --> 01:21:33,018
I'm not a demon,
you're insane!

960
01:21:37,064 --> 01:21:38,899
Perloquus!

961
01:21:39,942 --> 01:21:42,194
You wanted to control Isabelle
the entire time.

962
01:21:45,322 --> 01:21:47,032
Depart, then, transgressor.

963
01:21:47,115 --> 01:21:49,284
Depart, seducer, full of evil.

964
01:21:49,535 --> 01:21:51,745
and cunning, foe of virtue.

965
01:21:52,037 --> 01:21:54,164
[shouting]
Persecutor of the innocent.

966
01:21:54,331 --> 01:21:55,666
[smack]

967
01:21:56,208 --> 01:21:57,209
[growls]

968
01:21:58,001 --> 01:21:59,002
[hard punch]

969
01:21:59,419 --> 01:22:00,546
Hit me! Do it!

970
01:22:00,629 --> 01:22:01,797
Never!

971
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:03,590
It's who you are,
it's in your blood.

972
01:22:03,757 --> 01:22:05,175
[smack]

973
01:22:07,302 --> 01:22:08,303
It's not who I am.

974
01:22:09,096 --> 01:22:12,641
You spineless coward!
Defend yourself!

975
01:22:54,349 --> 01:22:56,059
[breathing heavily]

976
01:23:09,406 --> 01:23:14,036
And now....
as I adjure you in his name,

977
01:23:14,578 --> 01:23:17,706
begone from this woman who is
his creature.

978
01:23:18,415 --> 01:23:20,667
It is futile to resist his will.

979
01:23:21,084 --> 01:23:22,169
The longer you delay,

980
01:23:22,252 --> 01:23:24,213
the heavier your
punishment shall be

981
01:23:24,296 --> 01:23:26,256
for it is not men
you are condemning,

982
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:27,549
but rather him,

983
01:23:27,674 --> 01:23:29,843
who rules the living
and the dead,

984
01:23:29,927 --> 01:23:32,387
who shall come to judge
the living and the dead,

985
01:23:32,471 --> 01:23:33,722
and the world by fire.

986
01:23:36,183 --> 01:23:37,518
Leave Perloquus.

987
01:23:38,435 --> 01:23:40,687
And may God
bless yourself forever.

988
01:24:36,869 --> 01:24:37,953
Jesus.

989
01:24:47,462 --> 01:24:49,423
[demon's voice in the distance]

990
01:25:03,562 --> 01:25:05,480
What the hell are you doing?

991
01:25:06,231 --> 01:25:07,900
[sarcastic laugh]

992
01:25:49,191 --> 01:25:50,817
Why are you here?

993
01:25:52,486 --> 01:25:53,862
It's a long story.

994
01:26:09,044 --> 01:26:10,546
You're going to be Ok.

995
01:26:31,525 --> 01:26:33,694
[soft music]
