1
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,612
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:23,182
the moment we've
all been waiting for,

3
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:28,420
the one, the only
Linda Lovelace!

4
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,625
<i>- What's your name?</i>
<i>- Linda Lovelace.</i>

5
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,561
<i>I meant</i>
<i>what's your real name?</i>

6
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:37,529
<i>- That's my real name.</i>
- <i>- So, what did you do</i>

7
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,698
<i>before you were the first ever</i>
<i>pornographic film superstar?</i>

8
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,101
<i>How does it feel</i>
<i>to be the poster girl</i>

9
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:43,402
<i>for the sexual revolution?</i>

10
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:45,137
<i>The pornographic film</i>
<i>Deep Throat</i>

11
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:47,139
<i>has become one</i>
<i>of the most popular</i>

12
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:49,241
<i>and profitable</i>
<i>blue movies of all time.</i>

13
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:52,377
<i>Today a Manhattan criminal court</i>
judge <i>ruled the film obscene</i>

14
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,813
<i>and ordered it removed from</i>
<i>theaters in New York City.</i>

15
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:57,683
<i>This is kind of a strange country,</i>
isn't it? Judges can <i>see</i> Deep Throat,

16
00:01:57,685 --> 00:02:00,185
<i>- but they can't listen to those tapes.</i>
- <i>- Deep Throat,</i>

17
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:03,288
<i>a trendsetting film that brought</i>
pornography into <i>popular culture.</i>

18
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,891
<i>How did you become Linda</i>
<i>Lovelace in the first place,</i>

19
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:07,659
<i>if you were born</i>
<i>as Linda Boreman?</i>

20
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,428
<i>I think</i>
<i>you can be a star,</i>

21
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,396
<i>and I don't mean just</i>
<i>an adult-movie star.</i>

22
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,899
<i>I mean a real star.</i>

23
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:15,834
<i>Is your name</i>
<i>Linda Lovelace?</i>

24
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:17,870
<i>So tell me,</i>

25
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:21,640
<i>who's the real Linda Lovelace?</i>

26
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:59,444
- No! Patsy! Come on.
- Jeez! Come on, Miss Holy Holy.

27
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,947
- You want to get tan lines?
- Mm.

28
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,782
You're gonna
thank me later.

29
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:06,618
So have you slept
with that guy yet?

30
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,422
- No. Patsy, come on.
- Don't be such a prude.

31
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:11,924
- You're 21 years old.
- Prude?

32
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:13,792
How am I a prude?
I think I've learned

33
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,494
my lesson that one time,
thank you very much.

34
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:18,463
There are other things
that you can do.

35
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,800
Ugh. I don't even know
how to talk to you anymore.

36
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:24,303
Seriously, that's disgusting.

37
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:27,439
- That's disgusting.

38
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:30,742
- Linda!
- Shit, is that your mom?

39
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,277
I thought you said
she was work.

40
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,478
- Linda.
- Take this, please.

41
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,813
- Yeah.
- Put it out.

42
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:37,816
Linda, are you out back?

43
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:41,420
Honestly, what is this,
a nudist colony?

44
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:44,723
- What are you wearing?
- Ma!

45
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,226
Get in the house.

46
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,972
OK? 'Cause everybody's
going fast.

47
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:01,540
- Ready?
- Ready.

48
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:04,643
- Careful.
- All I can see is your butt.

49
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:08,247
Oh, my God!

50
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:12,551
Cool band. They're
missing something, though,

51
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:14,653
- don't you think?
- Like what?

52
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:18,957
- Go-go dancers.
- You volunteering?

53
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,304
- Come on, babe.
- <i>¶ The way that you do</i>

54
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:34,439

<i>¶ 'Cause here I come</i>

63
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:05,704
- Actually, like...
- Do that again.

64
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,606
- I know.
- You enjoyed it.

65
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:09,408
I need, like, a week off.

66
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,678
- You two move pretty good up there.
- Thanks.

67
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,047
You ever think about
doing that professionally?

68
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:17,849
Yeah, right.

69
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:22,621
Yeah! Dancing girls in Vegas,
they make two or 300 bucks a night.

70
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:26,358
What? Ha. Someone would pay
that much to see me dance?

71
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,862
- I would.

72
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,631
I'm Chuck Traynor, by the way.

73
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:34,700
- I'm Patsy.
- Linda.

74
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:37,636
- You guys smoke grass?
- Yeah, sure.

75
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:39,905
Patsy, I have
to go home now.

76
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:42,074
It's a little bit of grass.
Come on, babe.

77
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:43,442
OK.

78
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,386
I'm good.

79
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:56,555
<i>In accordance with your hopes,</i>

80
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:59,024

<i>- thank you, and good night.</i>
<i>- Thanks, honey.</i>

83
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,400
<i>President Nixon addressing</i>
the nation <i>live from...</i>

84
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:10,369
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.
See you later. I'm going.

85
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,871
Linda!

86
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,074
Where do you
think you're going?

87
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:18,577
The beach.

88
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,112
It's dark.

89
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:23,782
And what on Earth
do you have on?

90
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:27,386
- It's a party.
- And whose party is it?

91
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:30,088
Uh, I'm going with Patsy and her
boyfriend Ray. It's a friend of his.

92
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,593
- And what does this Ray do?
- I don't know, Ma.

93
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:37,729
It's not like I made him
fill out a questionnaire.

94
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,965
Mm-mm.

95
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,704
I think Patsy said he was
a bartender, all right?

96
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:48,907
But I did tell them that I had
to be home by 11:00 on the nose.

97
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:54,513
Any later, and I'll call you,
swear to God.

98
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,685
- See you, sweetheart.

99
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:04,156
<i>¶ How long have we been</i>

100
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:06,925
<i>¶ Traveling, my friend?</i>

101
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,594
<i>The French Connection.</i>

102
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,597
You know that one?

103
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,667
- The one with that guy?
- Exactly.

104
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:18,870
My God, I was so stoned
when I saw that.

105
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,106
I couldn't figure out
what was going on.

106
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,874
I kept expecting there
to be subtitles.

107
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,776
- Yeah, there weren't.
- No, I know.

108
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,111
They were
speaking American.

109
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,579
No, but by the time
I figured that out,

110
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,648
it was, like,
halfway through the movie.

111
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,783
Hey, guys.
Let's go skinny-dipping.

112
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:35,454
No! I gotta go, so...

113
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:36,822
- What?
- Yeah.

114
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:39,991
You're such a drag.

115
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:43,495
We're gonna go. Whoo!

116
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:44,896
Come on.
I'm going in!

117
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,832
- Jump in!

118
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:49,668
- You don't dig the ocean?
- No.

119
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,536
I don't know.

120
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:02,581
- Ow.
- What?

121
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,950
- You bit me.
- I did?

122
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:07,486
- Yeah.
- No, I didn't.

123
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,188
It's cool.

124
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,625
You don't think
I'm a drag?

125
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:15,093
Well, I don't think
you're a drag at all.

126
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:18,497
- No?
- No way.

127
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,110
Thanks for the ride home.

128
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,979
Wait. Wait, wait,
wait, wait! Come on!

129
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:36,715
Come on!

130
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:39,684
You haven't said a word
since we got in the car.

131
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,987
You can tell me.

132
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:44,055
What is it?
What's going on?

133
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,295
OK.

134
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,303
- I got pregnant.
- Mm.

135
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:00,105
And I had a baby last year,

136
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:03,074
and that's why we
moved here from Yonkers.

137
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,877
Where's this...
Where's this baby now?

138
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,113
I don't even know.

139
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:11,182
My mom put him up
for adoption.

140
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:13,885
She told me I was signing
circumcision papers.

141
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:18,890
- Damn.
- Yeah.

142
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,194
I'd like to meet your folks.

143
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,665
- Really?
- I think they'd dig me.

144
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:29,734
No, they don't dig anybody.

145
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,570
They don't
even dig themselves.

146
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,171
Listen,
I'll make you a bet.

147
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,239
You have me over for dinner,

148
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,207
and by the end of the night,

149
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:40,946
if they say,
"What a lovely young man,"

150
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:43,848
- then I win.
- What do you win?

151
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,052
You spend the night
at my house.

152
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:50,088
And if they don't,
what do I win?

153
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,258
You spend the night
at my house.

154
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:01,933
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

155
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,971
OK. Right there.

156
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:26,992
Lord, make us
thankful for these

157
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:29,160
and all our many
blessings. Amen.

158
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,196
- Amen.
- Amen.

159
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:33,798
Chuck, I'd like
to thank you again

160
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,835
- for those lovely flowers.
- My pleasure.

161
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:38,970
Linda tells us that
you were in the service.

162
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,372
Yes, ma'am, Marine Corps.

163
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:42,340
Mr. Boreman was
in World War II.

164
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:45,276
Oh, yeah?
You in the Corps?

165
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,881
- No, Army. Italy, mostly.
- I was stationed in Korea.

166
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:52,283
I won a couple
of marksmanship competitions,

167
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,753
but that's about all
the action I ever saw.

168
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:56,354
I bet you would have
been brave, though.

169
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:58,423
The guys that served
with your father,

170
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:01,960
they're some of the bravest men
that I ever met.

171
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,297
So, what do you do now?

172
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:09,367
- I own a bar and restaurant.
- That's interesting.

173
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,269
What kind of bar
and restaurant?

174
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,738
Just good food
and pretty waitresses.

175
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,074
What do you do for work,
Mr. Boreman?

176
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:19,010
I was a cop in New York
before we moved to Florida.

177
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,979
Now I do security
at the airport.

178
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:23,782
Mr. Boreman has
a million stories, Chuck.

179
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:25,884
Is that right?

<i>kitchen and warm his milk.</i>

181
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,255
<i>Milk. OK.</i>

182
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:33,458
Mugs are above the sink, Linda.

183
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,326
- Jesus.
- Forget about them.

184
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,729
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah.

185
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,837
Where are you?
Where are you right now?

186
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,073
- I'm with you.
- Yeah.

187
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:50,775
Yeah, that's my girl.

188
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:55,113
You're my girl, hmm?
Right?

189
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:57,749
Yeah.

190
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:07,158
<i>They don't eat with</i>
<i>their hands, you dope.</i>

191
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:13,932
- Say it.
- I... I'm...

192
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,768
I'm your girl.

193
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,237
How's it coming
out there, Linda?

194
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:23,074
Uh, almost there, Ma!

195
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:27,212
What time's the movie get out?

196
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:30,248
- I told you, 10:30.
- Be home at 11:00.

197
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,984
I know.

198
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:36,421
Seems
like a nice young man.

Oh, right. Um...

201
00:12:55,775 --> 00:13:00,011
Hey!

202
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,781
Just cut it out.

203
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,315
What are you
so uptight about?

204
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:05,984
- My scar. It's gross.
- Come on. Foxy girl like you

205
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,819
should love
to show off her body.

206
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:10,088
Come on. Come on.
Let me see.

207
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,123
Come on.
Let me see it.

208
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,293
- It's gross.
- Please?

209
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:22,834
This is it?
This little thing?

210
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,471
Ah.

211
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,374
It's ugly. I hate it.

212
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:34,078
Why? 'Cause it's different?
'Cause it's not perfect?

213
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,584
All those uptight idiots
in the suburbs.

214
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,320
All those
cookie-cutter robots

215
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,556
that your mama
goes to church with.

216
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:49,427
Screw 'em.

217
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:53,298
Screw 'em.

218
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,135
'Cause this and you,

219
00:13:57,137 --> 00:14:00,038
mm, are beautiful.

220
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:30,501
You're late.

221
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,427
Come on, baby.

222
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:09,440
Yeah!

223
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:19,183
To... Keep going.
Keep going. Boom.

224
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:20,652
And here we go.

225
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:23,087
You put a lot
of margarita mix in there.

226
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,690
Uh, yeah. OK.

227
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,696
Margarita?

228
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:34,933
- Thanks.
- Hey.

229
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,701
Hey.

230
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,170
- Mmm.

231
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:43,274
- You like porno?
- I like some.

232
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,677
You like 'em.

233
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,045
- No.
- I can tell.

234
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:48,313
- Yeah, you do.
- I don't.

235
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:49,647
- Yeah.
- I don't actually.

236
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,016
Trust me.

237
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:54,252
- I love your XXX.
- What are you doing?

238
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:57,188
- Hey!
- But Linda won't mind. She's cool.

239
00:15:58,424 --> 00:15:59,624
OK?

240
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,264
I wouldn't go in there
if I were you.

241
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:19,110
- Oh, my God.
- Home movie.

242
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:22,046
My parents took one of me once,
but it didn't look like this.

243
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:25,083
I bet.

244
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:27,118
I've never seen
a porno before.

245
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,486
Is it turning you on?

246
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,754
Good girls
don't do that stuff.

247
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:32,123
Oh, 'cause you're
a good girl?

248
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,059
I can tell you're
such a good girl.

249
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:37,562
That's what I love about
you. You're such a good girl.

250
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,381
- Come on.

251
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:59,150
I don't want to.

252
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:03,054
You know, maybe that's 'cause
you're not any good at it.

253
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:06,090
- Come on. You're gonna love it.
- Really?

254
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:09,527
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna like it? Choking myself?

255
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:13,097
I could teach you. Remember
how I got you to quit smoking?

256
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,799
Yeah. You gonna
hypnotize me?

257
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:18,302
It's the same mind-body
control technique.

258
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:21,773
Yeah?

259
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:27,311
Out of sight. Ah!

260
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,817
Hey, your mind has control.

261
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:35,086
Come on. A little more.
There you go.

262
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:37,789
Take it in. That's right.

263
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,592
Don't forget to breathe.
Come here.

264
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,533
Don't forget

You got it. OK? Go.

267
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,511
Oh, yeah.

268
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:13,317
Congratulations,
Mrs. Chuck Traynor.

269
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,754
I've never done it with
a married man before.

270
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:19,190
- Me neither.
- Good.

271
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:48,252
- Hello.
- - <i>Hi. It's me.</i>

272
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:49,921
Where are you? I've been
really worried about you.

00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:51,656
<i>Get some money,</i>
<i>and come get me.</i>

00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:53,791
<i>- I'm in jail.</i>
<i>- Ha-ha. Very funny.</i>

275
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:57,495
Here you go, ma'am.

276
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,866
Oh! OK.

277
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,637
What happened, Chuck?

278
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,540
What did I say?

279
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:15,913
But this is different.

280
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,422
Whoo!

281
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:36,334
You said never ask
about your work.

282
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,536
That's right.

283
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,351
Some girls were
turning tricks out back.

284
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,554
What do you mean by...
Prostitution?

285
00:20:56,556 --> 00:21:00,291
Yeah. Linda,
it's a titty bar.

286
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:04,962
What do you think these
girls live off? Minimum wage?

287
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:07,431
Wait. The cops gonna
come ask me questions?

288
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,867
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no, baby.

289
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:12,970
Wives can't testify
against husbands.

290
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:19,410
Hey. Look,
all I need is money.

291
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:23,314
Look, after paying your
bail, I have, um, $32, $33.

292
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:25,683
Linda, real money.

293
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:28,753
It's the IRS
and the Miami PD,

294
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:31,789
and it's all just
that shakedown.

295
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,792
- Do you have enough?
- "We."

296
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:40,765
Baby, do we
have enough, right?

297
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,733
- No, we don't.
- Mm-mm.

298
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:46,037
- Not yet.
- So, what are we gonna do?

299
00:21:56,548 --> 00:22:02,486
Mary had a little lamb,
whose fleece was white as snow,

300
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:06,457
and everywhere
that Mary went...

301
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:09,694
...the lamb was sure to go.

302
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,600
Yeah, right?

303
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:19,603
- That... That was great.

304
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:24,075
- Did I tell you, or what, right?
- You did. You told us.

305
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:30,414
Sweetheart, there's
a little diner on the corner.

306
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:35,086
Why don't you run down,
grab us four coffees, regular?

307
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,455
- OK.
- All right?

308
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:39,523
- On the corner?
- Yeah.

309
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:43,594
- Thanks a lot, darling.
- Beautiful work.

310
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:45,763
Jesus fucking Christ, Chuck.
What the fuck was that?

311
00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:48,432
Does she even know what
she was auditioning for?

312
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:52,603
I know. I know. She's new at this
professionally. I could show you this thing.

313
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:54,672
Well, Chuck, she's really cute.
She's adorable.

314
00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:57,908
She's like a sexy
Raggedy Ann or something.

315
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:01,145
- Cute freckles.
- Really dug her freckles. It was very...

316
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:04,515
But, you know, for this
industry, I don't... I don't know.

317
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:06,417
You don't know what, Jerry?

318
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,653
Go ahead. Be honest.

319
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:11,122
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

320
00:23:11,124 --> 00:23:13,924
No, look, the point is,
we traffic in fantasy here.

321
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:17,862
Yeah, she's very real, the kind of
girl you sit next to her in class.

322
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:19,897
You see her out on the street,
you want to ball her.

323
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,767
But, you know, you've seen the
girls that come in and do this now.

324
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:24,535
I mean, they've all
been to the surgeon.

325
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:25,936
I mean, you can't light
your cigarette around 'em.

326
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:27,138
You're afraid their tits
are gonna go up

327
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,472
like the Hindenburg
or something.

328
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:29,607
Linda has tits.

329
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:31,142
She does. Nice ones, too.

330
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:33,110
Not the point.

331
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:35,079
It's not like the old days, you
know, where you just point a camera

332
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,847
at two people screwing,
and you call it art.

333
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,682
I mean, the audiences
expect a lot more.

334
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:42,453
She's beautiful, but,
you know, more pizzazz.

335
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:44,555
- We need more pizzazz.
- No offense.

336
00:23:44,557 --> 00:23:46,524
I'm gonna show you
what Jerry's talking about.

337
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:48,492
- No, I...
- Nicky, come here for a sec.

338
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:50,494
I want to show you this... I want
to show you this movie we made.

339
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:55,099
Now, this is
the prototype, right?

340
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:58,769
People want blonde hair,
huge tits,

341
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,771
and a nice,
beautiful round ass.

342
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,907
It's the harsh reality
of our chosen profession.

343
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:05,042
- Dynamite work, Nicky.
- Thanks, Butch.

344
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,577
I'm gonna show you this.

345
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:09,747
Chuck, we are
making a movie here

346
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:13,050
on 35 millimeter.
Jerry even wrote a script.

347
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:16,053
- Forty-two pages. - You hear
that? Forty-two fucking pages.

348
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:17,755
This thing is
gonna be in theaters,

349
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:19,924
and, look, people
want what they want.

350
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:21,225
Chuck, your girl,

351
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:23,194
she's cute, she's skinny.
She's got no hips.

352
00:24:23,196 --> 00:24:26,664
It's like making a war movie
without the fighting.

353
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,165
Tits and ass,
that's the action.

354
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,869
Chuck, I don't want to
bum you out. Can she type?

355
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:34,104
Maybe I could find some work
for her in the office.

356
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:35,873
Look at this! Look at the...

357
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,241
I don't care about this.
Listen to me.

358
00:24:37,243 --> 00:24:39,076
I know she doesn't
have it. Chuck.

359
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:41,045
- Look at that!
- We just saw what she could do.

360
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:42,613
- She acted? Couldn't act.
- Look what she can do.

361
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:44,148
- Look! See?
- Whoa, Butchie.

362
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,883
But... Are you...
Did you see this?

363
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:50,221
Look at this. Look at
this. Are you seeing this?

364
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,892
- Holy shit.
- Oh!

365
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,696
Wait. Is that real?

366
00:24:58,698 --> 00:24:59,930
Is she actually
doing that?

367
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:01,565
Yeah, right.

368
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:03,734
Ho ho!
Oh, my God!

369
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:05,970
Yeah, can she do that
with a big cock?

370
00:25:05,972 --> 00:25:08,539
- No offense.
- She can do that with anything.

371
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:11,275
Ah, that's far out.
That is... You see that?

372
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:14,078
That is art, baby.
That's art.

373
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:41,805
- Anybody want a hit?
- Jerry?

374
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:44,241
- Yeah?
- Not a cloud in the sky.

375
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:45,609
What's with all
the fucking lights?

376
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:47,177
Shadows, Butchie, shadows.

377
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:49,780
Your shadows are costing me
hundreds of dollars.

378
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:51,882
You want to turn the lights off?
You want it to look like shit?

379
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,651
No problem.
I'll turn 'em all off.

380
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:57,688
Fucking artist, huh?

381
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:01,559
- Bad toupee.
- Wants to make a movie without lights.

382
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:05,195
How long have you been
a makeup person?

383
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:07,097
Oh, I'm not
a professional.

384
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,900
I mean, not in makeup,
anyway.

385
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,803
You know, when you get to
be my age in this business,

386
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:15,706
it helps to have
as many skills as you can.

387
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,742
I don't have any skills.

388
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,111
That's not what I heard.

389
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:23,113
There she is.
Here's our star, huh?

390
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:24,815
What'd I tell you?
The girl next door.

391
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:27,618
Linda, this is our financier,
Anthony Romano.

392
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,787
It's very nice to meet you.

393
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:31,989
Sweetheart, let me
tell you something.

394
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:34,124
If what these guys
are saying is true,

395
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:37,061
this is gonna be the best
investment of my life.

396
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:42,032
I can't wait
to see your work.

397
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:44,868
Yeah. Oh, and this is Dolly.

398
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:48,105
- This is Linda's costar and makeup artist.
- A pleasure.

399
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,975
- I have many skills.
- Yeah? Do you?

400
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:53,911
Let's let the stars
get back to work, huh?

401
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:56,680
All right.
We'll see you later.

402
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,753
Easy there, sister.
Don't cover her freckles.

403
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:05,089
OK.

404
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:08,626
Hey. What are you doing?

405
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:09,727
Her freckles are her thing.

406
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:10,894
- All right?
- OK.

407
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:13,230
Be cool.

408
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:18,035
You look good.

409
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:20,237
All right.
Just not too much, OK?

410
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:22,740
- You hear me?
- Yeah, I hear you.

411
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:29,713
Wow, he's pretty intense.

412
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:34,051
I used to have
an old man like that once.

413
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:37,688
You know, I should probably...

414
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:40,057
...do something about those.

415
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,163
Mr. Damiano will be really pissed
if I just leave 'em like that.

416
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:51,235
- I'm so clumsy.
- I know, sweetie.

417
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:54,772
We all are.

418
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:58,342
There's just got to be more
to life than screwing around.

419
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:01,178
Than screwing around.

420
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:05,449
Sex, I don't enjoy it.

421
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:08,852
Sex, I don't enjoy it.

422
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,689
Linda? Harry.

423
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,459
We're getting it on
in the next scene.

424
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:18,362
Oh, hey.
It's nice to meet you.

425
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:20,064
I thought your name was Dick.

426
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:22,099
My stage name used
to be Dick Long,

427
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:24,735
but it sounded kind of
obvious, so you know...

428
00:28:24,737 --> 00:28:27,237
Yeah. I agree.

429
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:30,240
This is a great business,
isn't it?

430
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:32,176
Anyway, I just
thought I'd come by

431
00:28:32,178 --> 00:28:34,378
and introduce myself before
we started going at it.

432
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,081
You OK?

433
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:39,950
I'm a little nervous.

434
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:42,052
I've never had lines
to talk before.

435
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,225
We got the best job
in the world.

436
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,728
We just tune everybody out,
live in the moment,

437
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,197
like we're the only two people
on the planet.

438
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:57,401
Tune everybody out.

439
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:59,803
- Live in the moment.
- Exactly.

440
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:02,172
You're gonna do great.

441
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:06,176
And I cannot wait
to get it on.

442
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:11,348
- Action!

443
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:19,356
- Whoa. Whoa. You all right?
- Yeah.

444
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:22,326
You OK? Yeah?

445
00:29:22,328 --> 00:29:23,827
You're just gonna
drive normally.

446
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:25,295
You know what
we're doing, right?

447
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:27,097
- Mm-hmm. Right.
- OK.

448
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,233
It's just I don't know
how I normally drive.

449
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:31,869
- You...
- I just drive, you know.

450
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:34,004
Yeah, that's exactly right.
Just drive,

451
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:37,407
and pretend we're not here, OK?
Whatever you'd normally do.

452
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:40,277
All right, we rolling?
Let's roll.

453
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:56,126
Doing beautiful,
baby, beautiful!

454
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:05,169
All right, sound, speed.

455
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:10,474
And action.

456
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:13,010
It's not that I'm
turned off to sex.

457
00:30:13,012 --> 00:30:14,978
I enjoy it. In fact,

458
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,247
I could spend the rest
of my life getting laid.

459
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:19,216
Then what seems
to be the problem?

460
00:30:19,218 --> 00:30:22,319
Well, I don't know.
Something's different.

461
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:25,189
I mean, there's just
got to be more to it

462
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:28,425
- than just a lot of little tingles.
- Little tingles?

463
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:31,361
- I want to hear bells ringing.
- Bells?

464
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:34,331
- Dams bursting!
- Dams bursting?

465
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,934
- Bombs going off!
- Bombs going off!

466
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:40,504
- Something.
- Nurse, Mrs. Lovelace is done with her bubbles.

467
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:44,474
- Thank you, Dr. Young.
- Open your mouth for me.

468
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:46,410
Wider. Ah.

469
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:48,178
- Ahh...
- Ah, ah, ah.

470
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,948
- Ah? Ah? Ah?
- Ah.

471
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,917
Well, there it is!

472
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,953
There it is,
you little bugger!

473
00:30:55,955 --> 00:30:57,855
- What?
- Your clitoris.

474
00:30:57,857 --> 00:30:59,423
It's down in the bottom
of your throat.

475
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:05,429
Oh now, now, Mrs. Lovelace.

476
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:07,998
There, there. Listen.
It's better to have a clitoris

477
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,237
deep down in the bottom of your
throat than to have no clitoris at all.

478
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:16,173
That's easy
for you to say.

479
00:31:16,175 --> 00:31:18,408
Suppose your balls
were in your ears.

480
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:22,412
Well, then, I could
hear myself coming.

481
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:25,382
And cut!

482
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:27,284
That was great.
That was great!

483
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:29,887
- That was fantastic, really. We good?
- Yeah.

484
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:31,588
Great work, everybody.
That's a wrap.

485
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:35,225
Two days down.
Five to go. Nice work.

486
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:37,160
You see?

487
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:44,334
You see that?
That's gonna be a problem.

488
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:49,273
- I need you to do me a favor, Chuck.
- - What's that?

489
00:31:49,275 --> 00:31:52,342
I need you to go to Miami,
pick up some film tomorrow.

490
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:55,012
Tomorrow? Tomorrow? Why?

491
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:56,380
- Why?
- Yeah.

492
00:31:56,382 --> 00:31:58,415
Because the stores
are all closed,

493
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:01,184
and if we run out of film
tomorrow, we're screwed.

494
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:04,321
But tomorrow's Linda's
big day. She needs me.

495
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:07,991
- Send somebody else.
- OK.

496
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:09,660
How about I send
Linda for the film,

497
00:32:09,662 --> 00:32:11,328
and you can spend tomorrow
with Harry's cock

498
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:15,132
- down your throat?
- Man.

499
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:20,237
You got no movie
without my girl, right?

500
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:22,406
- You know that, right, Butchie?
- Yeah.

501
00:32:22,408 --> 00:32:26,009
And we ain't got no movie
without no film neither.

502
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,680
Yeah.

503
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:54,738
<i>All right, this is it,</i>
<i>everybody. Here we go. Places!</i>

504
00:32:56,407 --> 00:33:00,677
Camera! And action!

505
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:03,246
You can try it on me.

506
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:06,083
You'll like it.

507
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:11,154
Well, what do I have to lose?

508
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:36,146
Not bad.
We're all gonna win Oscars.

509
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,157
Cut. Cut. Cut.
Whoa! Harry?

510
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:49,359
- Mm!
- What's the matter?

511
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:52,763
What's happening?
What'd you...

512
00:33:52,765 --> 00:33:56,299
- I don't... I'm... I...
- He came.

513
00:33:56,301 --> 00:34:01,605
- Yeah.
- He what? He came? You came? Get outta here.

514
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:03,673
What is this,
your junior prom?

515
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:05,809
I know. I didn't...
I just wasn't...

516
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:08,278
- Just give me three minutes. I can go again.
- I'm really sorry.

517
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,416
- Did I do something wrong?
- - No.

518
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:21,224
- Whoo-hoo!
- No, thanks.

519
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:24,494
Hey! Hey, this is silk!

520
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:28,298
- Oyster?
- Thank you.

521
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,067
- Thanks.
- How you doing?

522
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:32,569
Hey, oyster man! Yeah,
come here. We gotta talk.

523
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:36,640
- Oyster, sir?
- Best oysters in Miami. Come here, baby.

524
00:34:36,642 --> 00:34:40,077
You know, these are natural
aphrodisiacs, honey.

525
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,279
- Yeah?
- Yeah, they make you horny.

526
00:34:42,281 --> 00:34:45,248
- I'm always horny.

527
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,417
Marry me.

528
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,291
No girl for you?
I can fix that.

529
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:57,794
- No, thanks, Charlie.
- Hey, Linda.

530
00:34:57,796 --> 00:35:00,530
Why don't you come
sit on Mr. Romano's lap?

531
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:03,533
I'm having an interesting
conversation, Chuck.

532
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:05,102
Why don't you sit on his lap?

533
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:08,538
All right, come on.

534
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,574
Party's moving up to my room.
Where you going?

535
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:14,644
- Up to my room. Come on.
- We're going upstairs anyway.

536
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:25,889
- Hey, quiet.

537
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:28,291
Quiet. Quiet.

538
00:35:30,696 --> 00:35:35,365
Oh, my God, that...
that's unbelievable.

539
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:38,902
- Who's in the next room?
- That's Linda and Chuck.

540
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:43,573
Girl should be
in the fucking Olympics.

541
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,590
I'm a little nervous.

542
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:07,397
Let's try this. Forget I'm even
here. Forget about all this stuff.

543
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:08,932
Just be yourself.

544
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:17,307
OK, um, I don't think
for the movie poster,

545
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:22,212
we can be so anatomical.

546
00:36:22,214 --> 00:36:28,218
Just don't want to disappoint
anybody... I guess.

547
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,320
Tell me about the role
you're playing.

548
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:35,859
A girl whose clit...

549
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:39,262
- I know all that.
- OK.

550
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:43,600
Um, tell me about
the person you're playing.

551
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:47,737
Well, at first,

552
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:51,808
I'm closed up
like a flower...

553
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,711
- Mm-hmm. Yeah?
...bud.

554
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,947
And, um...

555
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:01,418
And then, gradually,

556
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,422
the petals start to...
to open,

557
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:07,891
and... and then...

558
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:11,895
...I finally
learn about myself,

559
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:16,399
and I learn
how to...

560
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:19,436
...to enjoy sex.
- Beautiful.

561
00:37:19,438 --> 00:37:22,739
Then I feel free.

562
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:48,765
Don't worry.
They're just Polaroid shots.

563
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:52,802
Oh, I know. It's not that.
It's just...

564
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:56,706
You made me beautiful.

565
00:37:56,708 --> 00:38:01,444
All right, all right, all right.
Hey, what's the matter?

566
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,380
Your girl
is gonna be a star.

567
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:06,516
Yeah, great, but who
the hell's Lovelace?

568
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:08,685
It's a dynamite name.
You got to admit that.

569
00:38:08,687 --> 00:38:11,021
What about my name?
Linda and I are a team.

570
00:38:11,023 --> 00:38:14,057
- What's wrong with Traynor?
- Nothing. Chuck Traynor.

571
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:16,993
- Good name for a producer.
- So I'm a producer now? That's funny.

572
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:19,329
I thought I was
a production assistant.

573
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:25,735
A girl like Linda, you want to see her
name in lights. Like "Linda Lovelace."

574
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:28,705
That's gotta go up
on a billboard, right?

575
00:38:28,707 --> 00:38:34,010
"Lovely lace, Lovelace."

576
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:38,381
- You're gonna be filthy rich.
- Me? No. You're gonna make a fortune.

577
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:40,550
- Ah.
- Come on, Charlie. You don't think

578
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:42,886
the investors deserve to make
a little bit of money?

579
00:38:42,888 --> 00:38:44,487
That's not what I'm saying.

580
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,756
And, you know,
my name isn't Charlie.

581
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:48,558
- Chuck.
- You got it.

582
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,660
Your girl's gonna be a star.

583
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:54,664
That's the value, man, and you,
you own the product.

584
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,634
"Keep on Truckin'"]

585
00:38:57,636 --> 00:39:00,370
- Two consenting adults.
- $6.00.

586
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:02,739
- Is it all guys in there?
- What do you care?

587
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:06,876
<i>Will you pass me</i>
<i>a cigarette, hon?</i>

588
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:10,547
<i>Do you mind if I
<i>smoke while you eat?</i>

589
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:14,050
Hey, did you hear
about Goldstein?

590
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:17,020
His magazine gave us 100 percent
on the peter meter.

591
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:19,422
Looks like we got
a full-blown big-titted hit!

592
00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:21,925
What's the peter meter?

593
00:39:21,927 --> 00:39:23,660
Did they say anything about
how the film was shot?

594
00:39:23,662 --> 00:39:25,695
Who gives a fuck, Jerry?
A hit's a hit.

595
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:28,865
<i>Well, then, I could</i>
<i>hear myself coming.</i>

596
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:34,070
<i>This is Chief Rocker</i>
<i>Frankie Crocker,</i>

597
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:37,941
on WNYJ Radio, New York City.
We're back with the star

598
00:39:37,943 --> 00:39:41,511
of the scintillating skin flick, <i>Deep</i>
Throat, <i>Linda Lovelace,</i>

599
00:39:41,513 --> 00:39:43,813
and the film director,
Jerry Damiano.

600
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:45,982
- Hi.
- Hello. Hello, New York.

601
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:48,118
Now, Jerry, you were saying
earlier how you as an artist

602
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,153
were able to transcend
the pornographic medium.

603
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:52,756
Yeah. Well, you know,
it wasn't that difficult to do.

604
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:55,658
I mean, it was... The industry
was getting pretty stale, you know.

605
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,762
Everything was just screwing, screwing,
screwing, and then cut to a money shot.

606
00:39:58,764 --> 00:40:00,764
You know, how many times you
supposed to look at that?

607
00:40:00,766 --> 00:40:02,665
This film is becoming
bigger than that, right?

608
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:05,068
I mean, this is a phenomenon.

609
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:19,015
<i>I went to see</i> Deep Throat <i>'cause</i>
I'm fond <i>of animal pictures.</i>

610
00:40:19,017 --> 00:40:21,017
<i>I thought it</i>
<i>was about giraffes.</i>

611
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,859
Linda, right here.
Big smile, Miss Lovelace.

612
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,070
<i>How does it feel to be</i>

613
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:43,039
<i>the poster girl</i>
<i>for the sexual revolution?</i>

614
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:44,707
<i>It's just a goof.</i>

615
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:46,676
To me, it's... it's a movie,

616
00:40:46,678 --> 00:40:48,545
like any other movie,

617
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:50,180
only it has so many
better things in it.

618
00:40:50,182 --> 00:40:53,082
- Like what?
- Like me.

619
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:05,995
Now, Linda, I mean, what do you want
to do with the future here, baby?

620
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:09,766
I hope to make movies,
real movies,

621
00:41:09,768 --> 00:41:13,470
<i>and maybe do a play.</i>

622
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:16,639
I want to be
an actress, you know.

623
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:20,043
<i>The Mississippi River.</i>

624
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:24,948
<i>What's the only thing that has a
bigger mouth <i>than Linda Lovelace?</i>

625
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:51,007
Right here!

626
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:54,143
- Please, Miss Lovelace!
- Linda!

627
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:58,948
- Linda.
- That's what I call a welcoming committee.

628
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:01,684
- Right on.
- Linda.

629
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:04,654
- Hi, Mr. Hefner.
- Hef, please.

630
00:42:04,656 --> 00:42:07,524
Welcome to your party.
How about I trade you

631
00:42:07,526 --> 00:42:11,027
- two blondes for a brunette?
- Yeah.

632
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:16,566
You come with me.

633
00:42:18,537 --> 00:42:21,871
- Look at this.
- Butchie Peraino.

634
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,206
- Big fan of yours, Mr. Hefner.
- Thanks.

635
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:25,141
Anthony Romano, Mr. Hefner.

636
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:27,877
Love the magazine. Love the
article about the swinger parties.

637
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:31,948
Thank you. You, Harry,
I'm a big fan of your work.

638
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,083
It is truly an honor, sir.

639
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:36,252
Oh, I used to tell people
that I had the best job

640
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:38,555
in the world
until I saw what you do.

641
00:42:38,557 --> 00:42:42,892
We'll see you gentlemen
inside.

642
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:51,868
- Look at these two cool cats.
- Mr. Sammy Davis Jr.

643
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:54,904
- Miss Lovelace.
- Sammy Davis Jr.

644
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:57,574
Better not miss this show.

645
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,690
- They love you.
- <i>Makes me feel sort of tingly all over,</i>

646
00:43:13,692 --> 00:43:17,160
<i>and then nothing.</i>
<i>There's got to be more to sex</i>

647
00:43:17,162 --> 00:43:20,930
<i>than just a lot</i>
<i>of little tingles.</i>

648
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:23,299
<i>There's gotta be bells ringing</i>

649
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:27,737
<i>and dams bursting</i>
<i>and bombs going off, something!</i>

650
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:30,873
<i>You wanna get off,</i>
<i>or you want to wreck a city?</i>

651
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:33,142
I think you can be a star.

652
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:36,846
I don't mean just
an adult-movie star.

653
00:43:36,848 --> 00:43:39,816
I mean a real star.

654
00:43:39,818 --> 00:43:43,786
Oh, I wish
I could believe that.

655
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:47,290
Well, trust me.
I see tons of girls

656
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:49,292
go through
this town every year.

657
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:51,928
- Most of them...

658
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:53,296
...go just like that.

659
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:01,237
<i>I hear bells ringing...</i>

660
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:04,207
<i>... and dams bursting,</i>

661
00:44:04,209 --> 00:44:07,076
<i>and bombs going off!</i>

662
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,227
- Fabulous.
- Very sexy, right? Right?

663
00:44:24,229 --> 00:44:26,329
No question.
We're getting laid tonight.

664
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:29,032
- We got a hit. We got a hit!
- No question.

665
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:37,940
Ladies and gentlemen, the moment
we've all been waiting for,

666
00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:42,745
the one, the only,
Linda Lovelace!

667
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:17,113
Are you ready for this?

668
00:45:17,115 --> 00:45:20,216
I want to set
the record straight.

669
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:28,791
All right, the first few are just to
establish a baseline, so just answer yes or no.

670
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:35,965
Is your name Linda Lovelace?

671
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:41,237
Can we start
with an easier question?

672
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:44,373
All right. Are you
currently working on a book

673
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:48,444
- about your life with Chuck Traynor?
- Yes.

674
00:45:48,446 --> 00:45:52,048
Are you taking this polygraph

I sell medical supplies.
How about you?

710

- Uh, I'm a part-time gynecologist.
- Really? Oh, that's so funny.

711
00:49:18,589 --> 00:49:22,391
We're actually coming out with a new
set of stirrups that make it a lot...

I get it.
That's very funny, yeah.

It is if you

Do you, uh, think
I could get a little?

- Yeah.

Yeah. Um...
Well, how much?

725

How much for what?
The pussy or the blow?

- Seriously?
- Seriously.

It's your lucky day.
I'm gonna go get Linda.

Hey, look at me.

729
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:14,070
- Hi, Ma.
- For the love of Christ, it's 2 a.m.

730
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:16,839
I know. I know.

731
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:23,345
Don't wake your father.

732
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:30,352
You want something to eat?
I got leftovers.

733
00:51:30,354 --> 00:51:34,590
- You're a bag of bones, Linda.
- No, I'm not hungry, Mom.

734
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:37,693
So, what'd you wake me up in
the middle of the night for?

735
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:44,300
I was really hoping
that, uh, I could, um...

736
00:51:44,302 --> 00:51:46,669
...move back in here
for a while.

737
00:51:46,671 --> 00:51:48,671
- Here?
- Yeah.

738
00:51:48,673 --> 00:51:51,340
No. You know
that's not possible.

739
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:55,311
- Why not?
- How would it look for a married woman

740
00:51:55,313 --> 00:51:58,781
to move in with her parents
apart from her husband?

741
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:03,319
He hits me, Ma.

742
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,660
I can't say I'm surprised.

743
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:15,364
What did you do?

744
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:17,233
What do you mean,
what'd I do?

745
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:20,169
What did you do
to make him angry?

746
00:52:20,171 --> 00:52:23,405
He didn't just hit you
out of the blue.

747
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:29,545
I guess I didn't do
what he wanted me to.

748
00:52:29,547 --> 00:52:32,515
You took a vow,

749
00:52:32,517 --> 00:52:34,884
a very serious vow.

750
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:42,224
Can't I just stay, like,
a few days, Ma, please?

751
00:52:42,226 --> 00:52:45,427
And then what?
You gonna get a divorce?

752
00:52:45,429 --> 00:52:47,229
What do you think we are,
Protestant?

753
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:49,298
Ma, you just don't understand.

754
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:55,371
Linda, I was...

755
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:02,378
I was 18 years old
when I had your sister,

756
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:05,514
unmarried...

757
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:08,751
...and all alone,

758
00:53:08,753 --> 00:53:11,287
before I met your father.

759
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:15,958
I'd suffered long and hard.

760
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:22,598
How dare you come here and
tell me I don't understand.

761
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,733
I understand.

762
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:31,207
Now, God gave you a husband,

763
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:33,242
who provides for you.

764
00:53:33,244 --> 00:53:35,578
And you...

765
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,915
Look at me.

766
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:44,320
Go home to Chuck.

767
00:53:44,322 --> 00:53:46,755
Be a good wife.

768
00:53:46,757 --> 00:53:51,660
Listen to him,
and obey him.

769
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:58,234
Can't I just stay for
a little while, Mom, please?

770
00:53:58,236 --> 00:54:00,469
Just please?

771
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:05,307
Mom, I just need,
like, a day, please.

772
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:07,743
- If you knew...
- That's enough.

- Hello?
- <i>Dorothy, it's Chuck.</i>

Hi, Chuck.

775
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:20,856
<i>- I'm sorry. It's late.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

776
00:54:20,858 --> 00:54:23,959
<i>I'm looking for Linda.</i>
<i>You know where she is?</i>

777
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:36,505
Yah!

778
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:40,876
I can't do it.

779
00:54:40,878 --> 00:54:42,745
I can't do it anymore.

780
00:54:42,747 --> 00:54:46,849
Yeah?

781
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,418
You can't do what?

782
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,553
Everything.
I can't do it.

783
00:54:51,555 --> 00:54:53,589
You're doing
the movie, Linda.

784
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:05,668
You know me, right?

785
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:09,371
Huh? You believe me?

786
00:55:09,373 --> 00:55:12,574
Right? You believe me?

787
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:15,644
Do you believe me?

788
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:17,413
OK.

789
00:55:17,415 --> 00:55:20,082
'Cause I worked
too fucking hard

790
00:55:20,084 --> 00:55:23,018
to get you this part.

791

Oh.

Oh, there, there,
Mrs. Lovelace.

796
00:55:45,476 --> 00:55:47,576
It's all right. Listen.
It's better to have a clitoris

797
00:55:47,578 --> 00:55:49,812
deep down in the bottom
of your throat than to have

798
00:55:49,814 --> 00:55:55,551
- no clitoris at all.
That's easy for you say.

799
00:55:55,553 --> 00:55:58,620
What if your balls
were in your ears?

800
00:55:58,622 --> 00:56:02,691
Well, then,
I'd hear myself coming.

801
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:06,762
And cut!

802
00:56:06,764 --> 00:56:09,798
That was great. That was great!
That was fantastic.

803
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,767
- We good?
- - Yeah, we got it.

00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:13,702
Great work, everybody.
That's a wrap.

Man, I don't think
that's them balling.

Oh!

811
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:46,034
If I tell you to sit,

812
00:56:46,036 --> 00:56:48,771
stay, screw, fuck,

- Yeah, of course.
- I'm worried about you.

- No.

I heard it was the best ten seconds
of your career on the first day.

849
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:30,198
- Leave it to the broad to get honest.
- What about me?

850
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,702
You fucked me. If the movie's
such a hit, where's my cut?

851
00:59:33,704 --> 00:59:36,805
I told Linda we're gonna double
her salary on <i>Deep Throat 2.</i>

852
00:59:36,807 --> 00:59:39,141
She's gonna get $2,500.
How about that?

853
00:59:39,143 --> 00:59:41,977
- You told Linda?
- Yeah.

854
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:47,616
Let me see the picture.
It's a full-on irregular pose.

855
00:59:47,618 --> 00:59:49,084
No.

856
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:53,121
No. No!
Chuck. Chuck, no!

857
00:59:53,123 --> 00:59:56,858
Chuck, it's freezing! God!

858
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:59,194
Chuck!

859
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:04,066
It was stupid.
I spoke to Butchie Peraino

860
01:00:04,068 --> 01:00:06,001
about my salary for the sequel.

861
01:00:06,003 --> 01:00:08,103
I never spoke to anybody
about money after that,

862
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:09,638
that's for sure.

863
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:12,708
Did Chuck control
your finances?

864
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:14,843
Yes, he controlled everything.

865
01:00:14,845 --> 01:00:20,215
<i>I never saw a penny, not even</i>
<i>after we moved to Malibu.</i>

866
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:27,356
<i>Yeah, but the</i>
<i>price break doesn't...</i>

867
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:29,791
I get pitched
this shit all the time.

868
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:31,660
It's gotta be something special.

869
01:00:31,662 --> 01:00:33,729
<i>- These are special.</i>
<i>- Could you make it glow?</i>

870
01:00:33,731 --> 01:00:36,298
<i>- Huh?</i>
<i>- Like glow in the dark?</i>

871
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,934
<i>Yeah, that'd be groovy, right?</i>

872
01:00:38,936 --> 01:00:42,070
And it should say
"Lovelace" on the side,

873
01:00:42,072 --> 01:00:44,406
and then Chuck Traynor
on the other side.

874
01:00:44,408 --> 01:00:46,942
<i>- Why would you want your name on</i>
the side? <i>- It's America, man!</i>

875
01:00:46,944 --> 01:00:48,710
Why wouldn't I want my name
on the side of a dildo?

876
01:00:48,712 --> 01:00:51,113
<i>You got it.</i>
<i>I'll send 'em out right away.</i>

877
01:00:51,115 --> 01:00:53,281
- All right. OK.
- <i>Thanks.</i>

878
01:00:53,283 --> 01:00:55,384
Talk to you later.

879
01:00:57,053 --> 01:00:59,054
All right,
where'd we leave off?

880
01:00:59,056 --> 01:01:05,394
Uh, part about the first time
I screwed Linda?

881
01:01:05,396 --> 01:01:07,029
"Chuck pushed me back.

882
01:01:07,031 --> 01:01:10,799
His fat, rock-like
muscle tore into me.

883
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:14,936
- 'Oh, my God,' I said."
- What do you think?

884
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:21,276
- Sounds good.
- But you got a problem with it.

885
01:01:21,278 --> 01:01:24,413
It's just that
your rock-like muscle

886
01:01:24,415 --> 01:01:26,915
seems to play
an inordinately large role

887
01:01:26,917 --> 01:01:30,152
- in Linda's autobiography.
- "Inordinately."

888
01:01:30,154 --> 01:01:33,822
- How'd you get here?
- Mr. Hefner sent me.

889
01:01:33,824 --> 01:01:36,224
Right. And how about the next
time I want your opinion,

890
01:01:36,226 --> 01:01:40,128
I'll ask you what
my cock tastes like.

891
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:43,331
Yes, sir, boss. Reckon
it tastes like a piña colada.

892
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:45,834
Anthony.

893
01:01:45,836 --> 01:01:48,403
- Hey, Chuck.
- How you doing? Look who's here.

894
01:01:48,405 --> 01:01:51,206
- Hi, Anthony.
- Look at you. Look at you.

895
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:53,975
You're like a... You're like a
regular California girl. Come here.

896
01:01:53,977 --> 01:01:57,946
- I thought you were in Vegas.
- Yeah. I just came back from the pa...

897
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:02,384
- What, are you kidding me?
- It's gonna look more like her.

898
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:07,856
Come outside.
I want to show you something.

899
01:02:07,858 --> 01:02:10,058
Great to see you, kid.

900
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,427
- Jesus.
- Gonna put freckles.

901
01:02:12,429 --> 01:02:14,396
Ah, Jesus.

902
01:02:14,398 --> 01:02:17,165
How you been?
Good to see you.

903
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:22,270
I bet you $10 the only thing

904
01:02:22,272 --> 01:02:24,906
rock-like on that man
is his brain.

905
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:27,809
You're gonna
get us into trouble.

906
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:31,146
Baby, look at us. I think
we're already in trouble.

907
01:02:33,784 --> 01:02:37,319
Good afternoon. Lovelace
Enterprises. Marsha speaking.

908
01:02:37,321 --> 01:02:40,856
Nice car, Chuck.
Must have cost you a few dimes.

909
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:43,859
- I know why you're here.
- I should hope so.

910
01:02:46,163 --> 01:02:48,497
I need a couple more weeks.

911
01:02:48,499 --> 01:02:51,433
We got the Linda Lovelace blow-up
dolls. We got all the sex toys.

912
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:54,770
Hey, you're getting, like,
five times your money back.

913
01:02:54,772 --> 01:02:57,773
Man, you want a blow-up doll?
I got a couple in the house.

914
01:02:57,775 --> 01:03:01,409
I don't want a fucking blow-up
doll. I want my 25 grand.

915
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:05,113
You'll get it. You're in on
the ground floor. We got the...

916
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:06,515
We got the <i>Playboy</i>
<i>spread coming out.</i>

917
01:03:06,517 --> 01:03:08,350
- Mm-hmm.
- She's a brand name.

918
01:03:08,352 --> 01:03:10,051
She's like
Betty fucking Crocker.

919
01:03:10,053 --> 01:03:12,020
No, she's Linda
fucking Lovelace.

920
01:03:12,022 --> 01:03:14,990
Listen to me.
You want to pay us back,

921
01:03:14,992 --> 01:03:17,225
you get her doing
what she's good at.

922
01:03:17,227 --> 01:03:21,129
Now, I got <i>Deep Throat 2, 3, 4
<i>lined up, ready to go.</i>

923
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:23,165
- No...
- Now, this is big business we're talking about,

924
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:26,434
not some fucking nickel-and-dime
shit you're talking about.

925
01:03:26,436 --> 01:03:30,906
See, that's where you're
wrong. This isn't small-time.

926
01:03:30,908 --> 01:03:33,809
I'm meeting this guy
at Hef's party, OK?

927
01:03:33,811 --> 01:03:36,111
This guy, he owns half
the adult bookstores

928
01:03:36,113 --> 01:03:39,548
on the West Coast,
millions in merchandise.

929
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:42,417
Linda, like,
sweet talks this guy, right?

930
01:03:42,419 --> 01:03:44,920
Or better yet,
she sweet sucks this guy,

931
01:03:44,922 --> 01:03:47,956
we're made in the shade!

932
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:50,025
Come on.
You worry too much.

933
01:03:50,027 --> 01:03:52,527
We're talking
about money, Chuck.

934
01:03:52,529 --> 01:03:56,064
I always worry about money.

935
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:01,937
<i>Well, what do I have to lose?</i>

936
01:04:01,939 --> 01:04:07,275
You know how sometimes...
life imitates art?

937
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:13,949
I think, um...

938
01:04:13,951 --> 01:04:17,185
I think this is one
of those moments.

939
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:59,995
Chuck seems to have
left with the car.

940
01:04:59,997 --> 01:05:03,231
Yeah. I see
he hasn't changed.

941
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:07,502
- Well, come on. I'll give you a lift.
- Really?

942
01:05:07,504 --> 01:05:10,272
Hey, why don't
we go someplace?

943
01:05:10,274 --> 01:05:15,110
Let's grab
a drink somewhere.

944
01:05:15,112 --> 01:05:18,313
- You don't want to?
- It's probably best just to take you home, Linda.

945
01:05:18,315 --> 01:05:20,282
- I'm sorry.
- OK.

946
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:41,169
Chuck!

947
01:05:58,220 --> 01:05:59,387
Hello?

948
01:05:59,389 --> 01:06:01,189
Hi, Daddy. Did I wake you?

949
01:06:01,191 --> 01:06:04,192
No. No, no, no.
We're just getting up.

950
01:06:04,194 --> 01:06:07,329
It's late out there, huh?
It's Linda.

951
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:09,431
Well, who else would it be
at this time of day?

952
01:06:09,433 --> 01:06:12,167
I just got home
from a party.

953
01:06:12,169 --> 01:06:14,302
Yeah, why am I
not surprised?

954
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:17,238
No, Daddy, it was
a business party.

955
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:20,608
But I met Sammy Davis Jr.

956
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:25,046
- Who's Sammy Davis Jr?
- You know who he is. He's that colored guy,

957
01:06:25,048 --> 01:06:28,483
you know, "Mr. Bojangles."

958
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:32,387
- She's right.
- <i>I know who he is, Dorothy.</i>

959
01:06:32,389 --> 01:06:35,423
I was just joshing.

960
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:42,197
Your mother, she, uh...

961
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:46,301
Every time that Johnny Carson
mentions your name,

962
01:06:46,303 --> 01:06:48,470
she changes the channel.

963
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:54,142
I saw your movie.

964
01:06:58,447 --> 01:07:00,415
I don't even know
who that was up there.

965
01:07:00,417 --> 01:07:03,418
That's certainly
not my little girl.

966
01:07:07,656 --> 01:07:10,058
I had to walk out.

967
01:07:14,263 --> 01:07:16,398
Was it something that we did?

968
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:21,236
<i>I keep thinking</i>
<i>that it has to be.</i>

969
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:33,081
I gotta go, Daddy.

970
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:38,586
I'll tell your mother
you said you're all right.

971
01:07:38,588 --> 01:07:41,122
I love you.

972
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:49,764
I'm sorry, Chuck.
I looked everywhere for you.

973
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:54,335
You lost us
a movie deal tonight,

974
01:07:54,337 --> 01:07:58,440
just sitting up onstage
taking bows like...

975
01:07:58,442 --> 01:08:00,575
...Princess fucking Grace.

976
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:04,312
- I'm sorry, Chuck.
- Fifty, maybe 100,000.

977
01:08:04,314 --> 01:08:07,615
- To do another fuck film?
- No, Linda, it's Shakespeare.

978
01:08:07,617 --> 01:08:10,785
I told them you do
a great English accent,

979
01:08:10,787 --> 01:08:14,089
particularly with
a cock down your throat.

980
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:19,694
Hey. Hey! Hey!

981
01:08:19,696 --> 01:08:22,297
I'm sorry, Chuck. I'm...

982
01:08:22,299 --> 01:08:27,635
I'm not doing
any more porn... ever.

983
01:08:45,154 --> 01:08:48,123
We're going to a party.
Come on.

984
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:52,694
- We just came from a party.
- Yeah.

985
01:09:01,904 --> 01:09:04,806
All right, here it is.

986
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:10,545
- Hey.
- How you doing?

987
01:09:10,547 --> 01:09:12,347
- Welcome to the party.
- Good to see you.

988
01:09:12,349 --> 01:09:14,516
This is Mr. Shapiro. He's a
big-time Hollywood producer.

989
01:09:14,518 --> 01:09:18,253
I'm a huge fan. I've seen
<i>Throat,</i> like, ten times.

990
01:09:18,255 --> 01:09:20,655
You look like... Let's go
inside. It's cool. It's...

991
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:22,891
In fact, I'm shooting
something right now.

992
01:09:22,893 --> 01:09:24,492
- It'd be perfect for you.
- All right.

993
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:26,227
Oh, is that what this...
Is this an audition?

994
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:28,429
Linda Lovelace audition?
No, no.

995
01:09:28,431 --> 01:09:31,399
- Give me a second.
- Absolutely. Sure.

996
01:09:31,401 --> 01:09:34,869
Just give us
some privacy for a minute. OK.

997
01:09:34,871 --> 01:09:37,805
You just sit down right here.
Just have a seat.

998
01:09:37,807 --> 01:09:42,443
You will sit here
and say nothing, OK?

999
01:09:49,219 --> 01:09:51,252
Chuck!

1000
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:53,354
Chuck!

1001
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:55,857
- Ah, man, you know what?
- What?

1002
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:57,425
- No.
- No, no, no. Come on. Come on.

1003
01:09:59,462 --> 01:10:01,863
What are you gonna do?

1004
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:04,499
No, it's gonna be
six times the money. Hey!

1005
01:10:04,501 --> 01:10:06,634
Listen to me!
Come here. Come here.

1006
01:10:06,636 --> 01:10:08,570
- This is crazy.
- Come here.

1007
01:10:08,572 --> 01:10:13,708
Come back in here. Shh!
Shut your mouth, OK?

1008
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:16,477
- You're gonna do this, you understand me?
- What?

1009
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:19,214
You're gonna do...
Just shut it.

1010
01:10:19,216 --> 01:10:22,817
You're gonna do this,
and there's nothing you

1011
01:10:22,819 --> 01:10:27,522
or Hugh fucking Hefner
can do about it, all right?

1012
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:32,293
- We're OK?
- OK.

1013
01:10:34,364 --> 01:10:38,233
OK, OK.
I'll talk to her.

1014
01:10:40,436 --> 01:10:41,903
- Chuck.

1015
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:43,905
You know what? I don't
think this is gonna...

1016
01:10:43,907 --> 01:10:46,007
- Oh, no, no. This'll work fine.
- No.

1017
01:10:46,009 --> 01:10:48,610
Just... Yeah, it's just...
OK, all right. That's...

1018
01:10:51,314 --> 01:10:53,448
- Baby, got a good one.
- Chuck! Chuck!

1019
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:57,385
No...

1020
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:01,623
Aw, man. Hi.

1021
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:29,517
You all right?

1022
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:37,358
Hey! Hey!

1023
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:41,729
Linda! Linda! Hey!

1024
01:11:45,502 --> 01:11:49,304
Oh, honey, honey, honey, honey!
Stay down. stay down.

1025
01:11:49,306 --> 01:11:51,539
Oh, my God.

1026
01:11:56,545 --> 01:11:58,579
Oh, my God.

1027
01:12:03,018 --> 01:12:05,987
Oh, Jesus. Get up.

1028
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:07,588
Get up.

1029
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:13,528
Oh, shit.

1030
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:16,931
Step away from the lady!

1031
01:12:16,933 --> 01:12:19,067
- Sir, step away from the lady!
- She's my wife.

1032
01:12:19,069 --> 01:12:22,537
- Step away from the lady now!
- Look, I'm her husband.

1033
01:12:22,539 --> 01:12:26,107
- Is that true, ma'am?
- Yeah.

1034
01:12:26,109 --> 01:12:27,809
Ma'am, are you OK?

1035
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:34,816
Wait a minute. I know you.
You're that chick, right?

1036
01:12:34,818 --> 01:12:37,985
- That's Linda Lovelace.
- Blow-job girl?

1037
01:12:37,987 --> 01:12:42,123
Sir, take her home,
and get her cleaned up, OK?

1038
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:45,760
- You have a good night.
- Yeah.

1039
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:49,030
Uh, hey, Miss Lovelace?

1040
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:54,702
Uh, think I could
have your autograph?

1041
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:09,610
Hi, operator.

1042
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:12,647
I'd like to make
a collect call.

1043
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:22,190
I wanted to talk to you
about the money Chuck owes.

1044
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:27,662
You mean, uh,
the money you and Chuck owe?

1045
01:14:27,664 --> 01:14:30,698
Chuck always
handled the money,

1046
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,467
so I've never
seen any of it.

1047
01:14:32,469 --> 01:14:35,870
OK, Linda, listen to me.
Just do another movie.

1048
01:14:35,872 --> 01:14:40,208
Call it whatever you want, <i>Really</i>
Deep Throat, <i>I don't care.</i>

1049
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:44,479
One more movie,
and youse both out of debt.

1050
01:14:44,481 --> 01:14:47,114
The world wants
to see you, Linda,

1051
01:14:47,116 --> 01:14:49,650
but they only want
to see you do one thing.

1052
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:52,220
You do another movie,
I'm gonna make sure

1053
01:14:52,222 --> 01:14:55,523
it's a classy production, and you're
gonna have any director you want.

1054
01:14:55,525 --> 01:15:00,027
I'm gonna bring Harry back.
Come on. It'll be like old times.

1055
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:03,631
Jesus.

1056
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:11,739
I just can't do it anymore.

1057
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:25,753
- Here you go. Thanks.
- Thank you.

1058
01:16:15,305 --> 01:16:18,673
Hello? Linda?

1059
01:16:18,675 --> 01:16:20,875
- Shh. Shh.
- - <i>Can I help you?</i>

1060
01:16:20,877 --> 01:16:26,681
Linda, it's Chuck, and I told
you I wanted to say I'm sorry.

1061
01:16:26,683 --> 01:16:30,918
<i>- This is the hotel operator.</i>
<i>- Oh.</i>

1062
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:33,120
Um...

1063
01:16:33,122 --> 01:16:35,623
Traynor. Traynor's room.

1064
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:36,824
<i>Could you spell that, please?</i>

1065
01:16:36,826 --> 01:16:40,661
Traynor, T-r-a-y-n-o-r?

1066
01:16:40,663 --> 01:16:44,332
<i>- T-r-a-y-n-o-r?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1067
01:16:44,334 --> 01:16:46,300
<i>Checking.</i>

1068
01:16:46,302 --> 01:16:48,736
<i>I'm sorry. I don't see</i>
<i>a guest by that name.</i>

1069
01:16:48,738 --> 01:16:52,974
Try Boreman.
B-o-r-e-e-m-a-n?

1070
01:16:52,976 --> 01:16:56,243
<i>- B-o-r-e-m-a-n?</i>
<i>- Um...</i>

1071
01:16:56,245 --> 01:17:00,014
<i>Any other... another name?</i>

1072
01:17:00,016 --> 01:17:03,684
Uh, Lovelace?

1073
01:17:03,686 --> 01:17:08,022
<i>I'm sorry. There isn't</i>
<i>a guest under that name.</i>

1074
01:17:08,024 --> 01:17:10,091
<i>Hello?</i>

1075
01:17:53,802 --> 01:17:56,003
You stupid bitch.

1076
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:03,310
Fuck.

1077
01:18:20,295 --> 01:18:23,097
Linda? Linda?

1078
01:18:23,099 --> 01:18:24,465
Linda?

1079
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:28,703
Hey, Charlie.

1080
01:18:28,705 --> 01:18:32,873
Um... I thought you said
Linda was staying here.

1081
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:37,978
She was.
We switched rooms this morning.

1082
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:41,148
You're gonna have to find
yourself a new porn star, Charlie.

1083
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:43,484
Um...

1084
01:18:43,486 --> 01:18:46,854
Hey. Hey, man. Is?

1085
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:52,760
No. No, no, no, no.

1086
01:18:52,762 --> 01:18:55,096
- Turn around. Turn around.
- No.

1087
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:01,235
Aah!

1088
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:09,310
Fucker.
You're not gonna...

1089
01:19:09,312 --> 01:19:11,045
You're not gonna see her!

1090
01:19:11,047 --> 01:19:13,948
You're not gonna
think about her!

1091
01:19:59,094 --> 01:20:01,529
Hello?

1092
01:20:01,531 --> 01:20:03,497
This is Linda Marchiano.

1093
01:20:09,204 --> 01:20:11,138
Oh, my God.

1094
01:20:12,374 --> 01:20:14,408
OK.

1095
01:20:15,243 --> 01:20:18,579
OK. OK, bye.

1096
01:20:23,318 --> 01:20:25,452
That was my publisher.

1097
01:20:25,454 --> 01:20:27,521
I passed the polygraph.

1098
01:20:29,257 --> 01:20:31,292
They believe me.

1099
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:34,962
You really want this?

1100
01:20:36,932 --> 01:20:40,534
I just really want people to
know what happened, you know.

1101
01:20:45,073 --> 01:20:47,174
Well, we'll explain
in just a moment, uh,

1102
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:49,543
why she is no longer
this person.

1103
01:20:49,545 --> 01:20:52,146
I hope she won't be offended
if I identify her by the name

1104
01:20:52,148 --> 01:20:54,481
<i>that really has</i>
<i>become world-famous,</i>

1105
01:20:54,483 --> 01:20:56,083
<i>a woman who starred</i>
<i>in what has been called</i>

1106
01:20:56,085 --> 01:20:58,052
<i>the</i> Gone With the Wind
<i>of pornography.</i>

1107
01:20:58,054 --> 01:21:00,921
<i>Would you please welcome</i>
<i>Linda Lovelace?</i>

1108
01:21:10,632 --> 01:21:13,400
Linda Lovelace's book
is titled <i>Ordeal,</i>

1109
01:21:13,402 --> 01:21:15,469
and it really was.
This is the...

1110
01:21:15,471 --> 01:21:17,304
This is the grimmest book
I've ever read in my life.

1111
01:21:17,306 --> 01:21:18,939
I mean, you've been
beaten, knocked around,

1112
01:21:18,941 --> 01:21:21,242
I mean, every liberty
in the world.

1113
01:21:21,244 --> 01:21:23,344
<i>How'd you get involved</i>
<i>with all that stuff?</i>

1114
01:21:23,346 --> 01:21:26,981
<i>I mean, how could a nice girl like</i>
you... <i>How do you answer that?</i>

1115
01:21:26,983 --> 01:21:30,517
<i>Well, I had the misfortune</i>
<i>of meeting Chuck Traynor.</i>

1116
01:21:30,519 --> 01:21:33,087
<i>But it didn't start out</i>
<i>like you're describing.</i>

1117
01:21:33,089 --> 01:21:36,891
<i>He was a... a gentleman</i>
<i>when I first met him.</i>

1118
01:21:36,893 --> 01:21:39,960
He was always opening doors for
me and lighting my cigarettes,

1119
01:21:39,962 --> 01:21:43,163
and he was very charming
when he wanted to be.

1120
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:46,133
<i>And I was young, you know.</i>
<i>I was...</i>

1121
01:21:46,135 --> 01:21:51,305
<i>I was 21 when I went</i>
<i>to live with him.</i>

1122
01:21:51,307 --> 01:21:57,111
<i>And it wasn't until after that that</i>
things just <i>started to change.</i>

1123
01:21:57,113 --> 01:22:02,917
<i>Uh, he started talking about</i>
<i>different sexual things,</i>

1124
01:22:02,919 --> 01:22:07,288
<i>things that I had</i>
<i>never heard of before,</i>

1125
01:22:07,290 --> 01:22:10,491
<i>things that I couldn't</i>
<i>imagine, you know.</i>

1126
01:22:10,493 --> 01:22:13,594
<i>I didn't want to.</i>
<i>You know, I was raised...</i>

1127
01:22:13,596 --> 01:22:17,231
<i>I was raised</i>
<i>to obey my husband,</i>

1128
01:22:17,233 --> 01:22:20,534
<i>to please him,</i>
<i>for better or for worse,</i>

1129
01:22:20,536 --> 01:22:24,638
- so that's what I did.
- Dear God.

1130
01:22:26,574 --> 01:22:29,043
Linda, I have read
your book, <i>Ordeal,</i>

1131
01:22:29,045 --> 01:22:31,712
and I still find it very hard
to relate to you

1132
01:22:31,714 --> 01:22:34,548
and to believe that you have
become a changed person.

1133
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:38,185
<i>I expect people</i>
<i>to have great difficulty</i>

1134
01:22:38,187 --> 01:22:40,521
<i>realizing how hard it</i>
<i>was for me to get out,</i>

1135
01:22:40,523 --> 01:22:43,657
<i>but I think people</i>
<i>who have known fear</i>

1136
01:22:43,659 --> 01:22:46,327
<i>will understand it,</i>
<i>though, immediately.</i>

1137
01:22:46,329 --> 01:22:49,396
Linda, do you think this book
will help bring about,

1138
01:22:49,398 --> 01:22:52,967
you know, any change for other
girls that are in this predicament?

1139
01:22:52,969 --> 01:22:56,036
I do have that hope. I... God
forbid there's somebody out there

1140
01:22:56,038 --> 01:22:58,706
that's going through
what I went through.

1141
01:22:58,708 --> 01:23:02,710
<i>And maybe they can get the</i>
<i>courage to get out of it.</i>

1142
01:23:02,712 --> 01:23:06,747
<i>I hope this book helps her</i>
<i>to realize that...</i>

1143
01:23:06,749 --> 01:23:10,517
...that you can come out of this
a complete person again.

1144
01:23:10,519 --> 01:23:14,054
<i>Linda, you really were, and are, but</i>
especially <i>in the early seventies,</i>

1145
01:23:14,056 --> 01:23:16,690
<i>you were quite a celebrity.</i>
<i>Everybody talked about you.</i>

1146
01:23:16,692 --> 01:23:22,496
All conversations about you
include a normal statement

1147
01:23:22,498 --> 01:23:24,498
that comes out dirty
because of the context.

1148
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,100
<i>That's an awful way for you...</i>

1149
01:23:26,102 --> 01:23:27,534
<i>That's gonna</i>
<i>follow you forever.</i>

1150
01:23:27,536 --> 01:23:30,104
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I spent exactly 17 days</i>

1151
01:23:30,106 --> 01:23:35,442
<i>in the pornography industry,</i>
<i>and somehow these 17 days</i>

1152
01:23:35,444 --> 01:23:37,544
are supposed to define who I am
<i>for the rest of my life,</i>

1153
01:23:37,546 --> 01:23:42,216
<i>but I hope that people</i>
<i>can see me</i>

1154
01:23:42,218 --> 01:23:44,118
for who I really am.

1155
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:47,388
<i>I mean, Linda Lovelace</i>
<i>was a fictitious character.</i>

1156
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:49,723
<i>My name is Linda Marchiano.</i>

1157
01:23:49,725 --> 01:23:52,426
I can finally be myself.

1158
01:23:52,428 --> 01:23:55,129
I'm a mother and a wife,

1159
01:23:55,131 --> 01:23:58,232
and that is where
I found my joy.

1160
01:24:11,246 --> 01:24:14,181
Go ahead. We'll give
you a minute, all right?

1161
01:24:14,183 --> 01:24:15,616
OK.

1162
01:24:29,564 --> 01:24:31,832
You made it.

1163
01:25:14,309 --> 01:25:16,810
I love you, Mom.

1164
01:25:20,849 --> 01:25:25,352
Oh, let's not make
a federal case out of this.

1165
01:25:26,821 --> 01:25:29,156
- Hey.
- - Hi.

1166
01:25:29,158 --> 01:25:32,359
- Hey, how are you?
- Good.

1167
01:25:32,361 --> 01:25:35,162
Let's get you
something to eat.

1168
01:25:35,164 --> 01:25:37,331
Good to see you. How you
doing? What have we got here?

1169
01:25:37,333 --> 01:25:41,735
Oh. Good to see you, man.
How you doing?
