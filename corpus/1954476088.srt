1
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:51,517
- Okay. Are we doing...
- Hi.

2
00:00:51,617 --> 00:00:53,252
- How are you?
- I'm not comin' out there.

3
00:00:53,352 --> 00:00:56,456
It's only a day and a half of work,
and you gonna be making $150.

4
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,058
- I look like a damn fool.
- I'm gonna come in.

5
00:00:59,158 --> 00:01:01,829
Okay. One, two, thre...

6
00:01:02,428 --> 00:01:03,896
You better stop it.

7
00:01:03,996 --> 00:01:07,166
Eileen, you come in on three.
You don't say, "One, two," and come in.

8
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:08,801
You say, "Three." Then you come in.

9
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:13,606
Look at you. You are
dressed for success.

10
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:15,708
I look like the whole
damn red-light district.

11
00:01:15,808 --> 00:01:18,044
I ain't had nothing like this
on since I was on that pole.

12
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:22,215
Ooh. Well, just think of this as
another pole. The North Pole.

13
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:24,016
They don't make it
rain at the North Pole.

14
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:25,918
At my age, I can't
get no rain nowhere.

15
00:01:26,018 --> 00:01:28,398
I get a little drizzle,
but them quarters hurt.

16
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,025
No, no, no. Well, this is beautiful.

17
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:36,362
Just think of this as a little
extra money for you and Cora.

18
00:01:36,462 --> 00:01:38,164
Honey, I don't buy Cora
nothing for Christmas.

19
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,066
I ain't bought her nothing
since she was seven years old.

20
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,501
- You're kidding.
- That's right.

21
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,437
Cora asked me for some money
for some dolls named Starz.

22
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,372
I couldn't afford it.
She just wanted them Starz.

23
00:01:46,472 --> 00:01:48,441
So all day Christmas,
she made me feel bad.

24
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,777
That night, Christmas dinner,
she's still sitting at the table crying.

25
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:53,413
I knocked the hell out of her.
You know what happened?

26
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:56,082
She saw stars. And she never
asked me for another gift.

27
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:58,384
- You are dreadful. Yes, you are.
- The truth.

28
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:01,220
- I can't do this, Eileen.
- Yes, you can. Stop.

29
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,789
- Now, just smile.
- Okay. I'm smiling.

30
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:04,857
Now, you should see...
Come over here.

31
00:02:04,957 --> 00:02:06,426
I gotta take you where you working.

32
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:09,829
You should see the lovely gifts
I bought for my daughter.

33
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,265
- How she doing?
- Oh, she is excellent.

34
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:14,434
You know she went to New
York to get a degree...

35
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:18,271
got her master's and up and
moved to Alabama of all places.

36
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:20,973
- What the hell she move to Alabama for?
- Who knows.

37
00:02:21,073 --> 00:02:25,278
Anyway, she took a little job there in
some little, small school, you know.

38
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:28,118
She says she wants to start a farm.

39
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:33,085
- A farm? What she starting a farm for?
- I don't know. I don't know.

40
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:36,622
But anyway, you know she got
tons of offers down here in Atlanta.

41
00:02:36,722 --> 00:02:39,358
But she didn't want to,
so what can you do?

42
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,061
- Maybe she's trying to get away from you.
- You better stop that.

43
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:43,930
- Where we going?
- My daughter loves me.

44
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,135
Round yon Virgin Mother...

45
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:52,849
- Was that you singing?
- No, ma'am.

46
00:02:53,272 --> 00:02:56,476
There's no one else in there,
Bailey McCoy.

47
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,412
Come on. Walk with me.
You're late again.

48
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,780
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,115
- I'm gonna have to talk to your parents.
- No.

50
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:06,719
I just woke up late.
I'll be here on time. I promise.

51
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,287
Budget cuts, budget cuts.

52
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:10,490
All right. Go on in class.

53
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,492
- We'll talk about this later. Okay?
- Okay.

54
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,831
And your singing.

55
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,576
I'm not gonna come in
here and listen to this.

56
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,911
All right, people!

57
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,309
Now, we may have to cancel
the Christmas Jubilee this year.

58
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:32,945
- No way!
- We don't have the budget!

59
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:34,881
Mayor, you hold on right there.

60
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,883
All right? Now, I grew
"poinsetters" for this.

61
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,284
Poinsettias.

62
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,088
- That's what I said.
- No, you didn't.

63
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,855
If this Christmas
Jubilee don't happen...

64
00:03:42,955 --> 00:03:44,757
what am I gonna do with
all them "poinsetters"?

65
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,159
- Poinsettias.
- Stop. Do I look stupid?

66
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:49,161
- Tanner, I understand.
- No, sir...

67
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:51,364
with all due respect,
I don't think you do.

68
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:54,166
Since they built that dam upriver,
we've been barely surviving.

69
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:56,469
Between that and the drought...

70
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,504
managed to put most of
our crops out of business.

71
00:03:58,604 --> 00:04:00,506
We need this Christmas Jubilee
to happen. You hear me?

72
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:03,543
We don't have the money.
I talked to the city council, didn't I?

73
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,811
You did, Your Honor.
He talked to him. I heard him.

74
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:09,248
- Take it out of the school.
- Hold on, Tanner McCoy.

75
00:04:09,348 --> 00:04:11,484
We've already cut
the school's budget...

76
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,053
and as principal,
I have to draw the line.

77
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,889
We have four teachers
teaching several classes.

78
00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:20,092
If we cut back more, we'll not be
able to finish the school year.

79
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:22,962
I don't care.
Somebody has to do something.

80
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,931
We have to have this
Christmas Jubilee.

81
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:28,668
It helps too many people around here
make enough money just to stay open.

82
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,703
We don't have the budget!

83
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:34,544
When we elected you as mayor,
you said you would help us!

84
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,377
I know. I'm sorry.

85
00:04:38,477 --> 00:04:42,381
Folks around here don't take too kindly
to politicians not keeping their word.

86
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:46,358
You keep putting all these good people
against the wall and see what happens.

87
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,589
Come on, fellas. Geez.

88
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,769
- This is ridiculous.
- Absolutely.

89
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,642
- You believe that guy?
- That was unpleasant.

90
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:00,666
Yes, it was.

91
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:02,468
- This is where you'll be working.
- Okay.

92
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,403
Okay? Have you ever
done sales before?

93
00:05:04,503 --> 00:05:08,274
- Yes, I sold trees.
- Christmas trees?

94
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,343
When you smoke 'em, they make
you feel like it's Christmas.

95
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,411
If you don't stop that nasty talk.

96
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:14,580
Stop it. I mean,
where goods were exchanged.

97
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,682
I was exchanging my
goodies back in the day.

98
00:05:16,782 --> 00:05:18,217
Yes, indeed.

99
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:20,397
- I got to bring...
- On the black market.

100
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:25,024
- I got to bring you back to church.
- You ain't bringing me to no church.

101
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,460
I ain't goin' to no church.
The devil is a lie.

102
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,595
- And you still married to him.
- Honey, honey...

103
00:05:29,695 --> 00:05:31,664
- Speak of the devil, listen. Listen.
- What, what, what?

104
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,899
- Y'all want me to work the register?
- No, no.

105
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:35,468
- Other people take...
- You sure?

106
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,370
You have to be bonded for that job.

107
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,372
If I took the register,
I'd be bonded out.

108
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,240
Okay. Yeah. No, no, no, no.

109
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,144
Listen, let's go over a little quick
review of what you're supposed to do.

110
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,047
- You teach me.
- You're supposed to direct the customers...

111
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,983
when they ask you for something,
and you can refer to this.

112
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,252
Okay? Now,
kitchenware is on the fifth floor.

113
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:54,820
- Kitchenware, fifth floor.
- Yes.

114
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,822
- Women's apparel is on the second...
- Y'all sell pears?

115
00:05:56,922 --> 00:05:58,791
Y'all got produce up there?

116
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,394
- Clothing. Women's clothing.
- Say, "Clothing." Don't say, "A pears."

117
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,229
I don't know what
"apparels" is. "A pears."

118
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,531
Okay. Young adults
is on the third floor.

119
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:09,402
- Young adults on the third floor.
- Makeup and perfume is here.

120
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,003
And over there across the hall.

121
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:13,339
- I get it. I'll be fine.
- All right, and listen.

122
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,175
Most important,
everybody gets the same greeting.

123
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,444
When they come in,
you look them in the face...

124
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:22,281
you smile pretty and you say,
"Merry Christmas.

125
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,650
It's a beautiful day at Tifton's.

126
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,154
Joy to you and yours.
Yes, may I help you?"

127
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,056
That what I say?
Fine. I will say that.

128
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,425
- You wanna go over it once?
- All right.

129
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,327
- Here's a customer. Okay.
- Can you help me?

130
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:37,063
- Yes. Merry...
- Yes.

131
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,731
Mary had a little...

132
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,800
- No, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

133
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,969
- It's a beautiful day at Tip...
- Tifton's.

134
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:46,305
- Tap... Tip... Tiptoes.
- Joy to you.

135
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:49,008
Joy to the world and the Lord
is come, and happy Easter.

136
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,577
What can... What can I
do for you at Tifton's?

137
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,757
Thank you. I'm looking
for women's lingerie.

138
00:06:54,446 --> 00:06:56,982
Honey? Who the lingerie for?

139
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:58,820
For me, of course.

140
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,188
I don't know about you
wearing the lingeries.

141
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:05,691
Those days are over, honey.
Somebody should've told you it's passed.

142
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,561
The lingeries is for young
people with tight, firm stuff.

143
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:11,030
What I would suggest you do, hunty...

144
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,899
I would suggest you walk
across the street to Target...

145
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:18,637
and ask them for some of those
really nice big, big-girl drawers...

146
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:20,639
so that you will be comfortable.

147
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:22,675
You don't wanna walk around
with a slingshot up your butt.

148
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,276
- Eileen!
- Come, come, come.

149
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:25,845
Come. Let me help you.

150
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,747
- You are so rude!
- She's something.

151
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:31,884
No, you are the one that's rude
anytime you bring lingerie to a man.

152
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:34,987
Who was the 37th president
of the United States?

153
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,666
I know.

154
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:42,038
Bailey, do you know?

155
00:07:44,663 --> 00:07:46,132
I know the answer.

156
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:49,301
I didn't ask you. I asked Bailey.

157
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:52,671
He don't know. He's always dirty.

158
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:55,207
And he's just a farm boy.

159
00:07:55,307 --> 00:08:00,646
Yes, but he's the only one to get
an A on all three of his last tests.

160
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:03,048
What did you get, Lucy?

161
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:04,650
Or you, Larry?

162
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,160
There will be no
bullying in this class.

163
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,157
I'll see you all tomorrow.
Do your homework.

164
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,759
Look over the list of songs
for the Christmas Jubilee.

165
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:16,762
Christmas is five days away.

166
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:18,908
Hold on a second, Bailey.

167
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:28,174
You gotta start speaking up
and participating in class.

168
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,009
I know you knew the answer.

169
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,411
You're are so smart and talented.

170
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:36,615
You get an A on every test.
You gotta believe in yourself.

171
00:08:36,715 --> 00:08:40,285
Lucy's right.
I'm just an old farm boy.

172
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:44,056
There is no such thing
as "just a farm boy."

173
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:47,465
You are smart. You can
be anything you want.

174
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:52,131
I can only imagine if you could
just stay awake in class.

175
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,867
- Are you up late at night?
- No, ma'am.

176
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:58,605
I want you to sing the lead
solo at the Christmas Jubilee.

177
00:08:59,571 --> 00:09:01,473
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

178
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:03,983
- Yes, you can.
- No.

179
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:08,051
You know what? I really
gotta go, Miss Williams.

180
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,991
My daddy's gonna be
waiting for me at home.

181
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:14,490
Go on.

182
00:09:25,597 --> 00:09:26,732
Hello?

183
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,834
I don't hear from you in six years...

184
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:32,204
and you call me out of the
blue because you need my help.

185
00:09:32,304 --> 00:09:33,873
Don't blame that on me.

186
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,809
You're the one who married Kelly
and stopped returning my calls.

187
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,577
You're not still bitter, are you?

188
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:41,189
Maybe. How is she?

189
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,955
I don't know. We're divorced.

190
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:47,786
Good. She was such a tramp.

191
00:09:47,886 --> 00:09:51,423
I can't believe you married her and
dumped me. That's what you get.

192
00:09:51,523 --> 00:09:53,592
Okay, okay.

193
00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:56,528
Hey, pull up, It was high school.
Am I forgiven?

194
00:09:56,628 --> 00:10:00,165
That depends. Can you help
me with my school situation?

195
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:03,102
- So you need sponsorship?
- Yes.

196
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,170
A call came in just as I
was leaving a meeting..

197
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,007
With a company that's in
the middle of a PR nightmare.

198
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,342
They could use some
goodwill right now.

199
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:14,179
Actually, in a town like yours.
So your timing may be perfect.

200
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,915
Tell me about it.

201
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,851
Can't do that until
we have a contract.

202
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,621
- You don't trust me?
- No, no, no, it's not that.

203
00:10:22,721 --> 00:10:24,926
I have to protect my
interests, that's all.

204
00:10:26,358 --> 00:10:27,660
Tell you what.

205
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,995
I'll come down with a contract,
you get your people to sign...

206
00:10:30,095 --> 00:10:31,764
and I'm sure I can pull in...

207
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,808
at least a hundred grand for
your school and its event.

208
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,304
$100,000. That would be great.

209
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,306
How soon can you get here?

210
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,174
You need the money
right away, don't you?

211
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,977
Yeah. So you're willing
to drive down to Alabama?

212
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:47,513
I will drive over tomorrow.

213
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:50,015
We'll get the contract signed,
then I'll have to leave...

214
00:10:50,115 --> 00:10:52,952
but I'll be back for the event.

215
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,132
That would be fantastic.

216
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,457
Oliver, thank you so much.

217
00:10:58,557 --> 00:10:59,692
See you soon.

218
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:00,893
- You got it.
- Bye.

219
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,266
Child, that Powerball is going up.

220
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:09,568
Hello? Hey, I need y'all to
go get me some scratch-offs.

221
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:11,570
- Yeah, and play the numbers for me.
- Can you help me?

222
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,172
That Powerball has
gotten really high.

223
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:14,573
Play number 22...

224
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:16,642
- Excuse me.
- 17,5 and 6.

225
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:19,545
Go play them numbers, and bring
me a bunch of scratch offs. Yeah.

226
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:22,114
Just two, three of 'em.
Don't spend a lot of money.

227
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,449
I need some help!

228
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,351
Hold on, 'cause somebody's
screaming at me.

229
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,531
I'm getting ready to
choke her. Hold on.

230
00:11:29,888 --> 00:11:32,558
Lady, you gonna need a damn
doctor if you holler at me again.

231
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:35,427
Do you understand?
Now, what can I help you with?

232
00:11:35,527 --> 00:11:37,429
- I need a watch for my husband.
- A men's watch.

233
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:40,666
A men's watch. You know,
I like it with a leather band.

234
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,168
- You know, a nice thin watch.
- Here are some men's...

235
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:45,371
Oh, hell. It's time for my break.

236
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,306
- Time for my break.
- Break?

237
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:48,874
No, wait.

238
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,442
- You're so rude.
- Bye, bye, bye.

239
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:53,278
- You rude as hell. You rude as hell.
- Please. I need a watch.

240
00:11:53,378 --> 00:11:55,748
Get out of my way. I'm trying
to go to the break room.

241
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:56,926
Wait! Come back!

242
00:12:01,286 --> 00:12:02,865
You still here?

243
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:05,424
He called me back.

244
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,604
Yeah? And?

245
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:13,232
He thinks he can get us
$100,000 in sponsorship money.

246
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,167
$100,000?

247
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,503
- Oh, my goodness, that would be so great.
- I know.

248
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,838
That would not only
pay for the Jubilee...

249
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:22,641
that would take us well into
next year's school year.

250
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:25,077
We could get new books,
maybe even a new computer.

251
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:27,980
Wait, calm down. It hasn't
happened yet. It's not done.

252
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,749
Okay, but I have faith that it is.

253
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:35,220
Lacey, thank you so much for
doing this. I really appreciate it.

254
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,724
I know this school is not the best,
but it is all we got.

255
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,260
And I know you could have gone
anywhere in the country...

256
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,429
with the credentials you have.

257
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,905
- I love it here.
- Thank you.

258
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,368
He's coming down tomorrow
with the contract.

259
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:52,337
This is so wonderful!
I gotta call the mayor.

260
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:54,473
- Yes.
- He's gonna be so excited.

261
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,675
This is going to be a wonderful
Christmas after all!

262
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,354
It's gonna be fantastic.

263
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:02,350
All right. I'll see you tomorrow.

264
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,043
- Hello?
- I must be dialing the wrong number.

265
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,113
You said that already,
but you called back five times.

266
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,948
So what number you trying to get?

267
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,383
I'm trying to reach
my daughter, Lacey.

268
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:40,786
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
she just walked in. Hold on.

269
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,966
- Who is that?
- Your mama.

270
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,662
- Hi, Mama.
- Who was that?

271
00:13:50,762 --> 00:13:52,264
That was Conner.

272
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,943
Conner?

273
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,336
That's the guy you hired
to help you with the farm?

274
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,138
Yeah, that's him.

275
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,974
Okay. I don't know if I
like him up there with you.

276
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,542
Suppose he gets fresh...

277
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,944
and you don't have no man
up there to protect you.

278
00:14:06,044 --> 00:14:08,147
Mama, I'm fine. What's going on?

279
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,682
I can't wait until you
taste the dinner...

280
00:14:10,782 --> 00:14:12,985
I have prepared for
you for Christmas.

281
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,587
Yeah, I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

282
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:18,097
I'm not gonna be able
to come home this year.

283
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,058
What?

284
00:14:20,158 --> 00:14:22,161
Uh-uh. It's Christmas.

285
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:25,030
I know, it's just I'm just
getting settled in...

286
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,199
and the farm needs a lot of work.

287
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,701
Uh-uh. You not no
farmer in the dell now.

288
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:31,270
It's not just the farm.

289
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,572
They've also decided to
extended the school year...

290
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,140
to the day before Christmas.

291
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,010
- What kind of school is that?
- We lost a lot of days...

292
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,146
because of the storms this summer,
so we have to make them up,

293
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:43,515
And I'm helping the kids prepare
songs for the Christmas Jubilee.

294
00:14:43,615 --> 00:14:47,486
And we have a budget crisis.
So it's just too busy right now, Mom.

295
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:48,487
I'll come up there.

296
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:49,988
- No.
- Yes.

297
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:52,057
- I haven't seen you in nine months...
- It's not the right time.

298
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,059
And you don't drive.

299
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,662
I can get somebody to
drive up there with me.

300
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:59,031
I can ask your Aunt
Madea to come with me.

301
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,301
Mama, can we just skip it this year?
It's only Christmas.

302
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,869
You bite your tongue,

303
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,238
Christmas is the time of year...

304
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:10,682
when we celebrate the birth of
Jesus with our families and...

305
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:15,013
Lacey, I don't have
to tell you that...

306
00:15:15,113 --> 00:15:17,816
you and I are the
only family we have,

307
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,996
I know. Mom, are you crying?

308
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:23,956
What was that, Conner?

309
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,158
I didn't say anything.

310
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,894
I'm sorry. Conner needs
my help, Mama. I gotta go.

311
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,165
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Love you Bye,

312
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:38,303
Do not look at me like that.
You don't understand.

313
00:15:38,403 --> 00:15:40,278
I didn't say a word.

314
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:47,679
Are you okay?

315
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:51,817
Girl, I don't know why I let you talk
me into comin' and doin' this job.

316
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:54,853
- I didn't take my medicine this morning.
- What medicine?

317
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:57,158
Five milligrams
of "Don't choke that ho."

318
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,092
These customers gettin' right...

319
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,227
I feel I'm getting ready
to maybe catch a case.

320
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:04,873
- I could spit.
- What's wrong with you?

321
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,638
Lacey's not coming for Christmas.

322
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,002
That ain't no problem.
Children grow up.

323
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,970
They don't wanna come home sometimes.

324
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,649
Something's wrong.

325
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,874
- Eileen?
- What?

326
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:19,078
I know that look in your eye.
Don't go jumpin' to no conclusion.

327
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,913
I don't jump to conclusions.

328
00:16:22,013 --> 00:16:24,916
Last time you went to
the doctor, you had a rash.

329
00:16:25,016 --> 00:16:28,220
Walked up in there, told the man
you had cancer and you was dying.

330
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,058
Madea, many people in my
family have died of cancer.

331
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,093
- I know your family.
- Yes.

332
00:16:35,193 --> 00:16:37,562
- My grandmother.
- Got hit by a bus.

333
00:16:37,662 --> 00:16:41,667
But she had cancer. My uncle Bayrod.

334
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,403
- Drowned.
- Because he had cancer.

335
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,204
- Eileen?
- What?

336
00:16:46,304 --> 00:16:48,507
No, no, no, no. Something is wrong.

337
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:51,243
Something is wrong with my child,
and I'm gonna find out what it is.

338
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,179
She's down there in the country,
and I don't know what's going on.

339
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,782
I haven't seen where she works,
where she live.

340
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:59,351
- It's just awful!
- Your daughter is grown.

341
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,354
Leave her alone. If she want to
come home, she will come home.

342
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:04,033
What you planning on doing?

343
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,091
I'm gonna go down there.

344
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,593
I'd like to see that,
'cause you don't drive.

345
00:17:08,693 --> 00:17:11,663
- You do.
- Child, I ain't goin' to no Alabama.

346
00:17:11,763 --> 00:17:15,334
Last time I was in Alabama, I was chained
to Andy Young and Jesse Jackson.

347
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:18,674
- You marched?
- We wasn't upright when we was marching.

348
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:23,408
- We gonna go down there.
- I'm not driving to no Alabama.

349
00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:26,411
All my stuff is illegal. I don't
like driving through Georgia.

350
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:28,714
You think I'm gettin' ready
to drive through Alabama?

351
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,782
- I'll pay you.
- What time you wanna leave?

352
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:32,884
Okay. Good.

353
00:17:32,984 --> 00:17:34,953
No, child. I can't get on
the road with my Cadillac.

354
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:39,191
It's got 4,785,000 miles on it,
and I just changed the oil in it.

355
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,259
Every light on the dashboard say...

356
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,666
"You crazy as hell if
you go anywhere in me."

357
00:17:45,163 --> 00:17:48,400
- Madea...
- I can't do it, hon. I'm sorry.

358
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,581
Have you ever thought maybe she
just don't want to see you, Eileen?

359
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,406
My daughter loves me.

360
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,409
She loves spending time with me.

361
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:00,812
All right, honey. If you find a ride,
I'll go up there with you.

362
00:18:00,912 --> 00:18:03,424
All right. Well, I will work on it.

363
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,405
Conner.

364
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:21,032
- What the hell you think you're doin'?
- What are you talking about?

365
00:18:21,132 --> 00:18:22,934
I was down at the feed store.

366
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:25,070
They tell me you're planning
on planting corn this year.

367
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,705
Yeah, I was.

368
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,940
I plant corn.

369
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,710
Well, actually, what I'm
working on can help all of us.

370
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,879
- What you're working on?
- Yeah.

371
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:37,416
You think you learned something down
in that college that I don't know about?

372
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,256
- That's not what I meant, Tanner.
- No, you don't.

373
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:43,789
And you better find
something else to plant.

374
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:46,558
You been gone from around
here for far too long.

375
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,226
I mean it, Conner.

376
00:18:48,326 --> 00:18:52,067
Otherwise, I'll be here every day,
kick your ass like I did back in school.

377
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,975
Eileen, we've had a lot of
complaints about your friend.

378
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:05,544
Oh, no.

379
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,679
Hey there. I was
getting ready to go...

380
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:10,649
- What's the matter?
- We're going to have to ask you to leave.

381
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:14,553
Good, it's about damn time.
I get out of... Give me my check.

382
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,061
We'll mail it to you.

383
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,424
No, honey. Eileen,
you better tell her.

384
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:22,360
Ain't nobody gonna mail me no check.
I didn't mail my work up in here.

385
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,729
You ain't mailing me no check.
Where's my money?

386
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:27,499
Madea, go home. I'll call you later.

387
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,968
I don't give a damn who calling who.
Somebody gonna give me my money.

388
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:32,170
Would you please leave quietly?

389
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,372
Oh, sure. You want
me to leave quietly?

390
00:19:34,472 --> 00:19:36,208
You want me to leave quietly?

391
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,477
I will show you how
to leave damn quietly.

392
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,445
Y'all gonna give me my damn money.

393
00:19:40,545 --> 00:19:44,449
But before I get my damn purse,
I'm gonna get money out this register.

394
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:46,251
- Excuse me.
- No, no.

395
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,154
No, you can't do that. Put... Madea.

396
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:51,156
Where my purse?
Unlock the damn thing!

397
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:54,092
I got my purse here. This is $150.

398
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:56,895
- This is what you owe me.
- Put that money back.

399
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,964
I'm gonna take something else.
I'm gonna take this dress.

400
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:01,032
- Stop it!
- Take whatever I want out of here.

401
00:20:01,132 --> 00:20:03,134
What's this pulling on me?

402
00:20:03,234 --> 00:20:04,870
You're embarrassing us.

403
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,873
What the hell y'all looking at?
What the hell all y'all looking at?

404
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:11,243
It's Christmas, and I'm takin'
what the hell I want up in here!

405
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:14,779
What y'all gonna do about it?
What y'all gonna do about it?

406
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:17,415
- I'll take this too.
- She didn't take her medication today.

407
00:20:17,515 --> 00:20:20,385
You got me coming up here,
trying to work in this place...

408
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,187
and I don't know
what the hell gonna...

409
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,356
Get out the way!
What the hell goin' on?

410
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:27,759
- I know what the hell I'm doing!
- She has never acted like this before.

411
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,895
I'm fabulous. I'm gone
with the wind fabulous.

412
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,733
I am so sorry.

413
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:54,019
Hi. I'm Lacey Williams,
Bailey's teacher.

414
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,961
- Right. Come on in.
- Thank you.

415
00:21:00,925 --> 00:21:02,727
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

416
00:21:02,827 --> 00:21:05,063
I just stopped by to talk to you.

417
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:08,233
I graded another one of Bailey's
homework assignments...

418
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,634
Listen, I'm sorry.

419
00:21:09,734 --> 00:21:12,971
He has to help his daddy at night,
so he doesn't get much time to study.

420
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:16,241
Then he gets up early in the
morning to work with him...

421
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:19,320
so I'll just have to get
on him to do better.

422
00:21:20,378 --> 00:21:22,219
He can't get any better.

423
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:25,250
- He gets straight A's.
- What?

424
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,920
Yeah. And to know he works after
school and in the morning...

425
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,855
is even more impressive.

426
00:21:30,955 --> 00:21:34,662
He really should go to a gifted
school with a fine arts department.

427
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:37,702
Wow.

428
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:42,801
I always knew he was smart.
I didn't know he was that smart.

429
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:46,371
Me and his daddy never
got much schoolin'.

430
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,908
You really think Bailey could
make it outside of this place?

431
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,781
I know he can.

432
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:55,046
I mean, that's really
all I want for him.

433
00:21:55,146 --> 00:21:57,949
Bailey is always telling me
how good you are to him...

434
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:01,620
and that you defend him in front
of those other kids, so thank you.

435
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,156
- Well, he's a very special boy.
- Yeah, he is.

436
00:22:05,256 --> 00:22:07,058
- Have a seat.
- Sure. Thank you.

437
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:09,670
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Yes.

438
00:22:10,261 --> 00:22:11,840
Thanks.

439
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,279
Thank you.

440
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:22,907
He also told me you want him to
sing at the Christmas Jubilee?

441
00:22:23,007 --> 00:22:25,343
Yes. He has a beautiful voice.

442
00:22:25,443 --> 00:22:28,079
You think the Jubilee is
gonna happen this year?

443
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:29,648
Yes, haven't you heard?

444
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:32,317
I got a friend of mine to
get us a sponsorship for it.

445
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:34,319
So it's definitely gonna happen.

446
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:37,193
- That's great news.
- Yeah, it really is.

447
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,429
Oh, hell. What do you want?

448
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,667
- Hi, I'm Lacey Williams.
- I know who you are.

449
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:51,036
You're Bailey's teacher.
Bailey's gonna be late to school.

450
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:54,308
He's got a lot of work to do here,
that's if he makes it at all.

451
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:57,451
No need come around
here no more. Okay?

452
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,617
I am so sorry.

453
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:04,827
Merry Christmas.

454
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:11,923
Oliver, this is so funny.

455
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:15,360
I hadn't spoken to your mother
in a while, and we got talking...

456
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,563
and she said you were drivin'
to Alabama to see Lacey!

457
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:20,899
Miss Eileen, I'm happy
to have the company.

458
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:24,335
Did I tell you I take blood pressure
medicine that makes me have to pee?

459
00:23:24,435 --> 00:23:27,572
- I'll have to go to the bathroom soon.
- Okay, go in the bush.

460
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:30,844
I'm not putting my tush over no bush.
I don't know what's wrong with you.

461
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:35,449
The leaves fell off
of it, but it work!

462
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,849
- Jesus. Baby...
- It the wintertime.

463
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:40,051
Just keep your eyes ahead.

464
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:43,221
Okay? No, no, no. She's always
like this, since a child.

465
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:44,789
- Yeah, since my childhood.
- Something's wrong.

466
00:23:44,889 --> 00:23:46,357
Something's wrong, but we accept it.

467
00:23:46,457 --> 00:23:48,426
You sure you didn't tell
her we were coming?

468
00:23:48,526 --> 00:23:50,562
I wanted this to be a big surprise!

469
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:52,241
I'm sure.

470
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:56,367
'Cause she's gonna be
so happy to see you!

471
00:23:56,467 --> 00:24:00,572
Madea, I told him how much
Lacey talks about him.

472
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:03,908
Why you hollerin' like I'm in the back
of an airplane and you in first class?

473
00:24:04,008 --> 00:24:06,511
I can hear you. You right here.

474
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,480
All I'm saying is this...

475
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,482
- What's your name, boy? Olive Oil?
- Oliver.

476
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:12,050
All I'm saying is this.

477
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,253
If she wanted to talk to you,
she would have called you all the time.

478
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:16,955
Don't get your hopes
up listening to Eileen.

479
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:20,258
Don't listen to her. You two
are gonna be together again.

480
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:22,660
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
I see it on your face.

481
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,395
I see it on your face. Yeah!

482
00:24:24,495 --> 00:24:26,397
I would like to see us
have another chance.

483
00:24:26,497 --> 00:24:29,100
Y'all was in high school back then.
I got to pee, son.

484
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,603
You been driving around
in circles for way too long.

485
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:34,739
Go on over there. Pull over there,
ask these people directions.

486
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:37,108
I'm gonna go in here
and use the bathroom.

487
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:39,010
No, Madea.
This place don't look right.

488
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,346
Eileen, here. This a...
Child, please.

489
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:44,015
I grew up in the country.
Ain't nobody in here.

490
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,195
He what sittin'
there willy-whilin'. Ask him.

491
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:49,487
Lord, this thing is high.
You gotta get me a step.

492
00:24:49,587 --> 00:24:51,723
'Scuse me, sir.
You look like a nice man.

493
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,992
How you doin'? We are lost.
He trying to find direction.

494
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,127
I need a bathroom. Is there
a bathroom here somewhere?

495
00:24:56,227 --> 00:24:58,429
Yes, ma'am. Right over yonder.

496
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:01,473
Get the directions here.
I got me to pee.

497
00:25:05,436 --> 00:25:07,038
Got to pee. Hell...

498
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,512
What the...

499
00:25:20,251 --> 00:25:22,887
Go! Drive! Drive, Olive Oil, drive!

500
00:25:22,987 --> 00:25:25,356
Put the pedal to the metal.
Get the hell outta here!

501
00:25:25,456 --> 00:25:27,926
- They're tryin' to get me!
- What did you do?

502
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,436
Drive! Hell, they're KKK!

503
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,206
- This ain't the right address, is it?
- That's what she said.

504
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:45,543
This can't be the right address.
These people might not be friendly.

505
00:25:45,643 --> 00:25:50,248
Look, this is 2013,
and it's almost Christmas.

506
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:51,983
Sure it'll be fine.

507
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,519
Boy, did you see what I
just went through in town?

508
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,087
True.

509
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:58,489
This just don't feel right.

510
00:25:58,589 --> 00:26:02,393
Up here in these woods,
ain't nobody around but us and trees.

511
00:26:02,493 --> 00:26:04,573
I don't like this.
Go knock on the door.

512
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:08,867
- Thanks a lot.
- What you worried about, son?

513
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,935
Somebody got to
live to tell the story.

514
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:13,471
Tell 'em what happened to you.
Somebody got be an activist.

515
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,573
Somebody got to call Sharpton.

516
00:26:15,673 --> 00:26:17,081
Never mind.

517
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:25,250
- Uh-oh. Who is that?
- I told you this was the wrong address.

518
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,123
We gotta go. Back up.

519
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,155
There she is! Pull up.

520
00:26:31,255 --> 00:26:32,790
We're at the right place.

521
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,799
- Come on. Hurry up.
- There she is.

522
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:39,536
- Lacey!
- Look at you.

523
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,644
Oh, my word. What are you doing here?

524
00:26:47,271 --> 00:26:50,942
I hitched a ride
with Oliver. Surprise!

525
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:52,510
Surprise!

526
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,879
- We came.
- Surprise.

527
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:56,558
Who are you?

528
00:26:57,982 --> 00:26:59,951
I'm Conner.

529
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:02,392
Girl, what the coroner doing here?
Who done died?

530
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:09,633
You are the farmhand that
she hired. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

531
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:12,297
I am Eileen, her mother.

532
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:16,707
And this is Madea,
her great-aunt on my daddy's side.

533
00:27:18,469 --> 00:27:20,371
She sure don't look happy to see us.

534
00:27:20,471 --> 00:27:22,573
You better bite your tongue.

535
00:27:22,673 --> 00:27:25,686
She is happy to see
me anytime. Tell her.

536
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:32,750
That don't look like happiness, honey.
That look like puredee constipation.

537
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:34,819
Hi, Conner.

538
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,287
How are ya? How ya doing?

539
00:27:36,387 --> 00:27:38,289
This handsome thing...

540
00:27:38,389 --> 00:27:41,059
this is Oliver, her boyfriend.

541
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,894
Her boyfriend?

542
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,131
Ex-boyfriend.

543
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:48,766
It was nice of you to call him.

544
00:27:48,866 --> 00:27:51,469
That was a nice ruse to
get to see him. Fund-raiser.

545
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:53,538
No, it wasn't a ruse.

546
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:55,440
You know you miss him.

547
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,409
Anyway, could you get my bags,
farmhand, please?

548
00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:00,646
- Yeah.
- I'll help.

549
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,415
Lacey, come show us this farm.

550
00:28:04,515 --> 00:28:06,617
A little dusty, dusty.

551
00:28:06,717 --> 00:28:09,821
Come, my dear. I knew that.

552
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:12,523
Baby, you know you got asthma.

553
00:28:12,623 --> 00:28:14,525
Mama, I don't have asthma anymore.

554
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:16,828
Yeah, but you still
gotta be careful...

555
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:19,564
because that could lead to cancer.

556
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:22,133
Everything don't lead to cancer,
Eileen. Lord, help her.

557
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:24,635
I'm gonna open the door.
Y'all need fresh air up in here.

558
00:28:24,735 --> 00:28:27,171
Got all these animals. This is
a nice room. I'll stay in here.

559
00:28:27,271 --> 00:28:28,639
- Good, good, good.
- Sure.

560
00:28:28,739 --> 00:28:31,175
Lacey, you do not
have a Christmas tree?

561
00:28:31,275 --> 00:28:32,744
- No, I don't.
- Oh, my God.

562
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:35,847
- That's why you wanted me to come here.
- Yeah, that's exactly why.

563
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:37,582
- I'm gonna take this room.
- Okay.

564
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,017
- Okay?
- That's nice too.

565
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:40,718
- That's a nice room.
- Thank you.

566
00:28:40,818 --> 00:28:43,721
- Is this one yours, Madea?
- Yeah, put it in the room on the end.

567
00:28:43,821 --> 00:28:45,423
- I'm staying down there.
- All right.

568
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:47,258
- All right.
- Is this your room here?

569
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:49,627
- It's my room.
- It's lovely.

570
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:51,396
Thank you. It's not clean.

571
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,598
- Okay, now where's the kitchen?
- Let's go that way.

572
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:55,333
- It's in there. Go ahead.
- I'm comin'.

573
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:57,301
Don't be pushing on me.

574
00:28:57,401 --> 00:28:59,737
We saw this. This is the
dining room. It's yellow.

575
00:28:59,837 --> 00:29:02,473
It's yellow. It's bright yellow!

576
00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:04,142
It's nice, Mama, huh?

577
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,677
Yeah, it's not my cup
of tea, but you know.

578
00:29:06,777 --> 00:29:09,080
- Back porch and everything.
- Aunt Madea, you like it?

579
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,983
- Yeah, look at all the animals.
- It's very nice. Yes.

580
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,052
Ask the man to bring
the groceries in.

581
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,721
- They're in the trunk of the car.
- His name is Conner.

582
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:20,591
I don't like you being up
here with him by yourself.

583
00:29:20,691 --> 00:29:23,094
What is Oliver supposed to think,
you living with a man?

584
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,263
Why should I care what Oliver thinks?

585
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:27,765
- You should. He still wants you.
- Mama, please.

586
00:29:27,865 --> 00:29:29,534
No, and you still want him.

587
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:31,869
I know it. I got that feeling.

588
00:29:31,969 --> 00:29:34,439
I want some grandbabies.
What you waiting on?

589
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,941
Eileen, stop meddling with that girl.

590
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:40,452
Okay? You is in everybody's business.
Just leave this child alone.

591
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:43,181
You have been talking
since we got in the car.

592
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,517
You talk too much, Eileen. Please,
just shut up for a little while here.

593
00:29:46,617 --> 00:29:48,352
Leave this child alone.
She living her life.

594
00:29:48,452 --> 00:29:51,328
She happy out here in the
farm playing Old MacDonald.

595
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,768
- Any more?
- Just the groceries.

596
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:05,336
All right.

597
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,516
- Hi.
- Wow.

598
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:11,019
- It's great to see you, Lacey.
- Yeah, you too.

599
00:30:11,742 --> 00:30:14,245
Let me put these down,
and I'll be ready to go to school.

600
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:15,753
- Yeah.
- All right?

601
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:23,221
So, you didn't tell me
your boyfriend was coming.

602
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,590
High school. Non-factor, trust me.

603
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,792
My mother... I can't believe
she just showed up.

604
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:29,927
And your parents are on their way.

605
00:30:30,027 --> 00:30:33,498
Yep. Gonna be here right after
you get back from school.

606
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,800
I know. What are we gonna do?

607
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,638
You better think of something.

608
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:41,543
- Baby...
- Boyfriend.

609
00:30:43,307 --> 00:30:45,743
- Are you ready to go?
- Yes, sure.

610
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:49,614
Hold on. Hold on. I heard
somebody say, "Go." Oh, Lord.

611
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,883
Take me anywhere. I got to
get away from your mama.

612
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,285
I'll go to hell and back
to get away from her.

613
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:56,287
She talk too damn much.
Can I go with y'all?

614
00:30:56,387 --> 00:31:00,291
Okay. Maybe you can keep an eye on
my class while I go into the meeting.

615
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,760
I'm sorry. Watch your class?

616
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,062
She wants me to watch
her class. Children?

617
00:31:05,162 --> 00:31:06,797
Child, me and children
don't get along.

618
00:31:06,897 --> 00:31:08,399
Now, let me see.

619
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:09,800
Ankle-biting...

620
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,536
disease-carrying...

621
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:15,616
little children of God,
or your mama...

622
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:19,710
satanic, loud-mouthed,
diarrhea woman from hell.

623
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:22,049
I think I'll go with the children.
Praise God.

624
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:25,650
- All right.
- I'll drop you back off on my way home.

625
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,718
Okay, close your trunk, son.
Close your trunk.

626
00:31:27,818 --> 00:31:29,487
I'm gonna ride with him.

627
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:32,857
No offense to y'all car,
'cause this a nice car.

628
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:35,159
But this bring back memories, child.

629
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:38,196
I got pregnant. Meat Loaf was
playing "Dashboard Light."

630
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:41,365
I was sitting up there, and I kept
hitting my head on that steering wheel.

631
00:31:41,465 --> 00:31:43,801
It was just awful.
It was an awful time.

632
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:46,270
Look. The door even sound the same.

633
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:49,774
Child, this is just what it's...
Yep, that bring back memories.

634
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:51,576
Watch this.

635
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,811
That's what I used to do. Drop it.

636
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:57,548
That car built for comfort and
built for speed, just like me.

637
00:31:57,648 --> 00:31:59,984
This a nice truck, but how
I'm s'posed to get in here?

638
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,453
- Pull the seat back.
- I'll sit in the back. Hold on.

639
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:04,989
No, you don't have to...
Yeah, just pull that back.

640
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,992
You got to get some of them
things to help me get in here.

641
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,761
Is there something to...
Hold on. I got it.

642
00:32:10,861 --> 00:32:12,730
Yeah, that's it. Come on in.

643
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,932
Boy, you got to get a low car here.

644
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:19,503
- You 'bout to make me mad.
- Give me your hand.

645
00:32:19,603 --> 00:32:23,082
- Now, hold on.
- All right, I got you.

646
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:27,345
- Good morning, class.
- Good morning.

647
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:31,115
This is my Aunt Mabel.
But everybody calls her Madea.

648
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:34,018
I have to go to a meeting down
the hall with Ms. Porter...

649
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:37,255
and I asked Miss Madea
to keep an eye on you.

650
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:40,558
Now, you know what to do and
you know how to behave, right?

651
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:42,193
Yes, ma'am.

652
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,662
- I'll be right back. Thanks, Madea.
- Yeah, I love it.

653
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:47,298
I love well-behaved children.
That's wonderful.

654
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:49,136
Y'all look so nice.

655
00:32:55,005 --> 00:32:58,409
Hello. Hello. Now, y'all got to
go back to the Stepford children.

656
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:02,079
Don't act like you... Don't act
like this. Now, calm the hell down.

657
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:05,816
I'm in here. Do yourself a favor.
Do the right thing.

658
00:33:05,916 --> 00:33:08,419
- You belong in this class?
- Yes, ma'am.

659
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,055
- Okay. What's your name?
- Bailey.

660
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,723
Bailey? Okay. Well, go on.

661
00:33:12,823 --> 00:33:15,893
Your teacher went down the hall,
and I'm sitting in for her. Have a seat.

662
00:33:15,993 --> 00:33:17,795
You better hope she comes back.

663
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:20,999
She's the only teacher
that likes you here.

664
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:27,271
Don't sit by me. You are so dirty.

665
00:33:27,371 --> 00:33:29,640
Leave that boy alone. Where else
he gonna sit? Sit down, son.

666
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,275
Sit down. Don't worry about her.

667
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:34,779
Don't you ever pick on somebody just
'cause you can. Do you understand?

668
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,847
They used to do that to me
when I was in kindergarten.

669
00:33:36,947 --> 00:33:39,784
'Cause I was six feet tall,
they all want to talk about me.

670
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:42,286
I had a full figure and
curves and all that stuff.

671
00:33:42,386 --> 00:33:44,755
They wanted to make fun of me.
But I wasn't having it.

672
00:33:44,855 --> 00:33:48,492
You understand? I fought back.
That's why I got tough-skinned.

673
00:33:48,592 --> 00:33:51,362
You may have to fight back sometimes.
Do you understand?

674
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:55,499
Don't worry about these people in
here trying to make you feel bad.

675
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:58,469
You got to be nice to people.
Pass it on, niceness.

676
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,471
- Do you understand?
- Yes, ma'am.

677
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:04,208
All right, I'm going to write
my name on the board...

678
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:06,945
so you all will know what my name is.

679
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:10,250
Ain't no chalk.
Y'all ain't got no chalk?

680
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:13,150
Ain't got no eraser either.
"No cause..."

681
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,053
Okay. I don't know
what all that mean.

682
00:34:16,153 --> 00:34:19,462
All right. Well,
what we gonna do is...

683
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,959
I'm gonna tell y'all a story.

684
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:25,696
This is the story of Christmas.
Christmas.

685
00:34:25,796 --> 00:34:30,201
This is what I learned when I
went to school... Sunday school.

686
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:34,611
This is the story of the nativities.

687
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,377
Little baby Jesus was born.

688
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:42,057
He was born to the Virgin Mary...

689
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,917
J. Blige, and as Mary was on tour...

690
00:34:47,017 --> 00:34:48,819
she met this man named Joe...

691
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:50,888
Manganiello, who played a werewolf.

692
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:53,591
And he was in love with her.
She said, "Joe.

693
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:56,026
I am thou-ist with the child-ist.

694
00:34:56,126 --> 00:34:58,896
And the holiness is come upon me...

695
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:01,406
and I'm going to have a baby-ist."

696
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,203
And Joe said, "Really?"

697
00:35:06,303 --> 00:35:08,372
They ain't know what to do.

698
00:35:08,472 --> 00:35:10,441
So he went on and stayed with her...

699
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:13,911
and they went on 'cause they
was expecting the holy child.

700
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:15,479
That's right.

701
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:19,984
And the Bible say in
second "Deuteronomo"...

702
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:25,089
that when he came to the earth...

703
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:28,926
he came through the Virgin...
piña colada.

704
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:30,995
And as she was there...

705
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:34,031
they were trying to find
somewhere to have the baby...

706
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:37,868
but they kept going to all these hotels,
and wouldn't none of 'em let them in.

707
00:35:37,968 --> 00:35:39,904
Marriott. Shut the door.

708
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:42,139
Hilton. Shut the door.

709
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:44,875
Tried to get to the Ritz-Carlton,
they said, "You don't belong here."

710
00:35:44,975 --> 00:35:47,945
Everybody just got put out.
They went to the Motel 6.

711
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:51,649
They didn't even leave the light
on for her. She was in the dark.

712
00:35:52,716 --> 00:35:55,219
Anyway, there was Mary...

713
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,988
'bout to have that baby,
so she sat down at a bus stop.

714
00:35:58,088 --> 00:36:00,090
MARTA bus passed by,
wouldn't even pick her up...

715
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,960
to take her to the holy
city of Birmingham.

716
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:07,031
And as she sat there,
she went into laborer.

717
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:09,200
And as she started laboring...

718
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,268
a mangy dog walked up beside her.

719
00:36:11,368 --> 00:36:14,839
See, God will send you a dog when
you need it, even if you don't.

720
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,907
And that dog said,
"What's wrong with you?"

721
00:36:17,007 --> 00:36:20,811
And as she sat there,
she had that baby...

722
00:36:20,911 --> 00:36:23,881
and that baby came
next to that mangy dog.

723
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:27,184
That's why they say he
was born in a mangy.

724
00:36:27,284 --> 00:36:29,420
Hallelujah. Let the Lord use ya.

725
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,556
Okay, that's the story of the baby Jesus.
That's the hip-hop version.

726
00:36:32,656 --> 00:36:36,101
I'm glad I went to church
and to Sunday school. Okay.

727
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:39,272
Where my purse?

728
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:43,076
Where my purse?

729
00:36:44,568 --> 00:36:46,470
Y'all ain't seen what
happened to my purse?

730
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,205
I'm gonna tell y'all another story.

731
00:36:48,305 --> 00:36:50,441
This is the story of Easter Sunday.

732
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,344
Jesus was hanging
between two thieves.

733
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:55,946
One was Baranibus and the
other was the Dinosaurus.

734
00:36:56,046 --> 00:36:58,183
Somebody better find
my purse right now.

735
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:03,287
- All we have to do is sign that thing?
- Yes.

736
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,656
Lacey told me you needed
the money right away.

737
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:08,392
So I spoke with my boss and
got the money in advance.

738
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,572
We're both very sure we'll
get the sponsorship.

739
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:13,063
What's in it for you?

740
00:37:13,163 --> 00:37:16,600
Well, my company gets paid a
10% commission by the company.

741
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,669
You get the entire 100 grand.

742
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:21,505
It will help us with the shortfall.

743
00:37:21,605 --> 00:37:24,041
- Is everything okay, Wilbur?
- Yes, Your Honor.

744
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:27,222
It's good. It is good.

745
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,825
All right then. Let's do this.

746
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:38,822
Wonderful. Here you go.

747
00:37:38,922 --> 00:37:42,026
Now, we'll bring the sponsors down
to the Jubilee for a photo op.

748
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:44,763
- That's all we ask.
- Of course.

749
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,164
- Thank you, son.
- You got it.

750
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:48,832
Thank you so much.

751
00:37:48,932 --> 00:37:51,168
You have no idea how
much we needed this.

752
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:53,370
- It's my pleasure.
- Lacey.

753
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:56,551
- Thank you.
- This is my town too.

754
00:37:57,474 --> 00:37:59,053
Glad I can help.

755
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:01,612
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

756
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:03,291
After you.

757
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,250
There you go.

758
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:09,260
You have no clue how much
you've just helped us. I mean...

759
00:38:09,853 --> 00:38:12,934
It was my pleasure.
I'm glad I could help.

760
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:16,860
- Thank you again.
- You got it.

761
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,163
- Here.
- What's this?

762
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:21,932
- It's your Christmas present.
- No. I can't take that.

763
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:24,468
- Sure you can.
- I really can't.

764
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:26,978
You've already done
enough for us. Thank you.

765
00:38:31,141 --> 00:38:32,443
What are you doing?

766
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:34,748
Your mother told me she
thought you missed me.

767
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:40,084
Look, I know we were children,
but I think about you still.

768
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:42,086
Listen, Oliver,
that was a long time ago...

769
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:44,555
- and I actually have to tell you...
- Lacey!

770
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,890
- Get in here. Quick!
- Excuse me.

771
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,569
Hurry!

772
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,794
There's a weird woman in here.

773
00:38:50,894 --> 00:38:52,930
What they did back in the day...

774
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,398
Lacey, who is this?

775
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,834
- My aunt Madea.
- Hi.

776
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:58,268
What are you doing?

777
00:38:58,368 --> 00:39:01,472
I was just teaching these
children a lesson on Jesus...

778
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:04,008
from the time he was born
until the time he died on Earth.

779
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,644
She tried to steal my purse, but I
taught her a lesson. Here you go.

780
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:10,180
Now you have been crowned
the Christmas... Praise. Hallelujah.

781
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,616
- I got her, didn't I? I got her, Bailey.
- Yes, ma'am.

782
00:39:12,716 --> 00:39:15,753
'Scuse me. Oliver, take me to the house.
I'm getting the hell outta here.

783
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,655
We'll talk when I get
back for the Jubilee.

784
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:20,927
Lucy. How do you even...
How did she...

785
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:26,341
That's a nice-lookin' tree.

786
00:39:45,749 --> 00:39:47,217
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

787
00:39:47,317 --> 00:39:49,319
- Are they here yet?
- Nope.

788
00:39:49,419 --> 00:39:51,989
I rushed home. How's my mother?

789
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:54,491
I don't know. She only
said two words to me.

790
00:39:54,591 --> 00:39:56,427
You think of how you're
gonna handle this yet?

791
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,362
No. Were you able to
talk to your parents?

792
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:00,041
Nope, no cell phone.

793
00:40:02,132 --> 00:40:04,872
Guess I'll have to talk to
'em now 'cause they're here.

794
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,939
- Hey, hey!
- Hi, y'all!

795
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,908
Hey, hey! Look at you!

796
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,815
Don't you go nowhere.

797
00:40:14,077 --> 00:40:15,713
I'm gonna get your mama.

798
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:18,549
- I look all right?
- Yeah, you look great.

799
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:20,684
- Son! Son!
- Mama! Daddy!

800
00:40:20,784 --> 00:40:22,488
Look at you!

801
00:40:23,086 --> 00:40:24,824
Daddy, not the bear hug!

802
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:28,092
Your old man still got it, don't he?

803
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:30,561
Look at my Grizzly Adams.

804
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:34,038
Look at you. You look
like a mountain man.

805
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:37,901
Hey, Son, see this? This ain't fat.
This is all foreskin.

806
00:40:38,001 --> 00:40:40,070
Buddy, stop. Don't start so early.

807
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,905
- You must be Lacey.
- Yes.

808
00:40:42,005 --> 00:40:43,574
Look at you!

809
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:45,309
- Oh, my!
- You put her down.

810
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:48,045
You don't gotta break
her and snap her neck.

811
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:50,314
Just give him a little nudge
to the flapjacks there.

812
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:53,383
He'll put you down.
Where are my manners?

813
00:40:53,483 --> 00:40:56,553
I am Conner's mama.
Please call me Mrs. Williams.

814
00:40:56,653 --> 00:40:59,056
- Hi.
- I kiddin'! You...

815
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:02,203
Call me Kim or Mama.
Just don't call me late for dinner.

816
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,194
I'm joshing you.

817
00:41:04,294 --> 00:41:06,597
- Look how pretty. She's very pretty.
- Thank you.

818
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:09,266
She is even more beautiful than
I ever could have imagined.

819
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:11,401
Thank you.

820
00:41:11,501 --> 00:41:14,204
So nice to finally meet you.

821
00:41:14,304 --> 00:41:15,773
You too.

822
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:17,341
Look at this place.

823
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:19,777
It is beautiful.
This place is stupendous.

824
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:23,147
My mama and daddy...
Sorry. I'm sorry.

825
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:25,649
They just would've been
so proud. Thank you.

826
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:27,385
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mama.

827
00:41:28,151 --> 00:41:30,420
I was so upset when I
heard you two eloped.

828
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,923
I thought maybe you'd
come down to Louisiana...

829
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:35,759
and went up the bayou for the
Swamp Manor to get hitched.

830
00:41:35,859 --> 00:41:39,129
We would have thrown you
such a shindig. You know that.

831
00:41:39,229 --> 00:41:41,198
Hey, I'm glad y'all did elope.

832
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:43,600
You done saved me
an assload of money.

833
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,169
So I appreciate it.

834
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:47,404
Well, you've spent enough
money on me already, Daddy.

835
00:41:47,504 --> 00:41:49,807
- I'm glad you recognize that.
- Honey, we love you.

836
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,942
Anything you want, my son. Anything.

837
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:53,277
Well...

838
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:55,013
Have you two eaten?

839
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:58,827
No, but...

840
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:01,685
Good, 'cause I caught
Christmas dinner.

841
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,187
Caught?

842
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:07,460
We are gonna have hot possum potpie.
I'm gonna make it.

843
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,127
It's good. Nice flaky crust.

844
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:11,695
Gonna have possum stew...

845
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:14,331
and your uncle DeWayne done
got me some white lightning.

846
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:16,567
Here, let me take this, Daddy.

847
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:19,169
Actually, Lacey's a vegetarian.

848
00:42:19,269 --> 00:42:22,239
She's a vegetarianist? On a farm.

849
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:24,308
- Honey, that must be hard.
- That don't mean nothing.

850
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:27,845
We's Baptist, and we still like a
nice possum stew every now and then.

851
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:31,048
No, Buddy. It means
she doesn't eat meat.

852
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:34,318
- She doesn't eat meat.
- Oh, you're a tofu farter.

853
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:36,386
- Daddy.
- Ain't nothing wrong with that.

854
00:42:36,486 --> 00:42:38,655
I like tofu farters. God bless you.

855
00:42:38,755 --> 00:42:40,724
All I'm saying, Son,
if she don't eat meat...

856
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:44,371
that might be a bad thing when it
comes to certain parts of the anatomy.

857
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:48,298
Mama, can you please... I'm sorry.

858
00:42:48,398 --> 00:42:50,200
We just met her. Now, stop.

859
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,736
- Start slow, all right?
- I was just kidding.

860
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:54,304
I'm sorry. He's crazy.

861
00:42:54,404 --> 00:42:56,473
What are we doing standing
out here getting all dusty?

862
00:42:56,573 --> 00:42:59,710
Let's go inside and get
our meal on. I'm starvin'.

863
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:02,679
I brought you some spices
from your Aunt Tutu's garden.

864
00:43:02,779 --> 00:43:04,248
- Okay. Mama...
- You're gonna love 'em.

865
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:06,984
- Let me go get that.
- Hang on, y'all.

866
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,562
Lacey's mama is cookin'.

867
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:11,955
Lacey's ma... She's here?

868
00:43:12,055 --> 00:43:13,490
- Your mama's here now?
- Yes.

869
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:15,993
- Her mama is here, Buddy.
- Hey, hey! All right.

870
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,828
Looks like we get
to meet the in-laws.

871
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,197
Actually, we kind of have a problem.

872
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:21,565
What's the problem?

873
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:23,870
Lacey hadn't told her
mama that we're married.

874
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:26,570
- What?
- Why ain't you told her?

875
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:27,838
Well...

876
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,507
my mother had dreams
for my entire life...

877
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:33,688
and Conner was not in that dream.

878
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,547
I'm sorry. I do...

879
00:43:37,647 --> 00:43:40,617
- I don't understand.
- I think I do. Let me ask you something.

880
00:43:40,717 --> 00:43:43,991
When she had them dreams,
was they in color or black-and-white?

881
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:50,529
She doesn't want you
with a white man.

882
00:43:53,196 --> 00:43:55,532
I'm sorry. That's awful.

883
00:43:55,632 --> 00:43:57,601
Honey, we taught
all of our children...

884
00:43:57,701 --> 00:43:59,870
"Never see color. Only see heart."

885
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:03,273
- Isn't that right, Conner?
- That's right.

886
00:44:03,373 --> 00:44:06,977
It's such a shame she does not
know what kind of person you are.

887
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,579
I'll tell you who he is.

888
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:12,149
Always taught him to
look at a woman's heart.

889
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:14,318
'Cause that's where their rack hangs.

890
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:15,585
Daddy.

891
00:44:15,685 --> 00:44:17,821
I'm just kiddin'.
She got a nice rack.

892
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:19,656
Your mama used to have a nice rack.

893
00:44:19,756 --> 00:44:22,859
Now she bends over, just looks
like she's got a 7-10 split.

894
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:25,395
- What the hell does that mean?
- It's a bowling term.

895
00:44:25,495 --> 00:44:27,698
- I don't like that, Daddy.
- I don't either.

896
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:31,134
I'm just kiddin'. I still like to go to
the bowling alley every now and then.

897
00:44:31,234 --> 00:44:33,370
- You're sexy to me.
- Will you hush?

898
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:36,173
I'm gonna start talking about
all your wrinkly, saggy parts.

899
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:39,411
- It's like a turkey giblet in there.
- That was over the line.

900
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:44,083
Well, honey, Conner,
who does she think you are?

901
00:44:44,681 --> 00:44:46,419
She thinks I'm the farm help.

902
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:49,987
- Well, there's a switcheroo.
- The farm help.

903
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:52,656
Do you think we should leave?
I think we should maybe leave.

904
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:55,559
I ain't goin' nowhere.
Hell, I just drove up here.

905
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:58,595
- I am tired. I want a beer.
- I don't want you guys to leave.

906
00:44:58,695 --> 00:45:01,139
Well, what should we do?

907
00:45:02,365 --> 00:45:04,401
Can you give me
some time to tell her?

908
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:08,305
I mean, I have to break it to
her gently. She's been very sick.

909
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:10,607
- Oh, no.
- I'm so sorry.

910
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:13,110
- What's wrong?
- She has a weak heart.

911
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,345
Then by all means, you just...

912
00:45:15,445 --> 00:45:17,681
take your time and tell
her when you're ready.

913
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:19,616
- Thank you.
- Okay.

914
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:22,419
We don't want her ticker
to tock out on you here.

915
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:24,287
- We'll behave ourselves.
- Yeah.

916
00:45:24,387 --> 00:45:26,123
- You know what we'll be?
- What?

917
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,725
- Parents of the help.
- That's right. Parents of the help.

918
00:45:28,825 --> 00:45:31,762
- "Can I get you something?"
- Let's head in.

919
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:34,164
- Come on.
- Daddy, behave.

920
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:37,067
I'll behave. Like a bull in a rodeo.

921
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:39,870
- Did you paint this? This is fabulous.
- I started.

922
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:41,872
- Still needs some work.
- Where you at?

923
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:43,974
I bet this house run them
in the double figures.

924
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,442
- Hey, Madea.
- Hey!

925
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:47,544
- This is my mama, Kim.
- How you doin'?

926
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:49,546
- Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Medium.

927
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:51,481
And this is my daddy, Buddy.

928
00:45:51,581 --> 00:45:53,283
- Nice to meet you.
- How you doin', Buddy?

929
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:55,752
- I'm doing well.
- I see y'all brought a bag.

930
00:45:55,852 --> 00:45:57,431
No, that's just my wife.

931
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:01,558
Forgive my husband. He is
just a horse's ass and a half.

932
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:04,561
- Wait. I smell cookin'.
- Yeah, that's Eileen.

933
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:06,696
- Her mama was up in there cooking.
- Where is she?

934
00:46:06,796 --> 00:46:08,999
She was in the kitchen,
but she went to the backyard.

935
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,934
Come on. Sit down. Take a load off.

936
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:13,670
Take a load off. Y'all sit a spell.

937
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:16,840
- Y'all want something to drink?
- I believe I'll have something.

938
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,842
I like you. You're a nice lady.

939
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,911
Don't be flirting with me
in front of your wife.

940
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:23,785
If I put this thing on,
you won't be able to get rid of it.

941
00:46:24,714 --> 00:46:27,084
I'll have him pay my rent,
car note and everything else.

942
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:28,854
I'm from the old school.

943
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:31,588
Believe me, he can't help it.

944
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:34,191
And if you can stand him,
you're welcome to him, right?

945
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,560
- Hey, Conner, get me a beer.
- Yes, sir.

946
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,128
Well, Miss Madea...

947
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:41,198
looks like we're gonna be spending
Christmas dinner together this year...

948
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,766
but don't you worry.

949
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:45,037
We could care less you're black.

950
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:49,272
"African-American," Buddy.

951
00:46:49,372 --> 00:46:52,275
Right, whatever. African-American.

952
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:54,678
That's all right. I don't care
that y'all are white America...

953
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:57,114
Angro... Angrola-Saxons...
Saxophonists.

954
00:46:57,214 --> 00:47:00,454
I don't care. That don't matter at
all that y'all Anglo-Saxophonists.

955
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:02,719
I like her.

956
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:05,255
She's got a good sense of humor
and those big, sturdy feet.

957
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:08,592
You need a good sense of
humor with this group in here.

958
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:11,161
- Here, Daddy, beer. Drink up.
- Appreciate it.

959
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:14,431
- Please, drink up.
- I'll tell you what, Son.

960
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:16,867
That last girl you with
was so dadgum ugly...

961
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:19,069
my dog humped her leg
and shut his eyeballs.

962
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,909
Oh, stop it. He's awful!

963
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:26,776
"He shut his eyeballs." That's ugly.

964
00:47:26,876 --> 00:47:30,480
Please forgive my husband.
He is a wannabe comedian.

965
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,048
You are no Jeff Foxworthy.

966
00:47:32,148 --> 00:47:34,684
Well, I try to be,
but who can? Who can?

967
00:47:34,784 --> 00:47:37,954
Did you hear the one about the
two rabbis and the black dude?

968
00:47:38,054 --> 00:47:39,789
- Daddy.
- No.

969
00:47:39,889 --> 00:47:42,359
Did you hear the one about the
stray bullet that killed the redneck...

970
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:44,661
for telling the story about the
rabbis and the black dude?

971
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:46,340
It's hilarious!

972
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:50,000
I got him, didn't I? I got him.

973
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,044
- Y'all get your ass shot.
- I like her. I do.

974
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,242
I do too. She likes to hang.

975
00:47:57,841 --> 00:47:59,809
No, ain't gonna be no
hanging around here now.

976
00:47:59,909 --> 00:48:01,945
No, he didn't mean that.
He meant that...

977
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,748
You calm the hell down?
You are so politically correct.

978
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:06,650
They're having fun.
I'm having fun too.

979
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:09,126
I wasn't offended.
Hell, I got a pistol.

980
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,389
I knew she knew that.
Let me ask you this.

981
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:13,957
Do you know Oprah?

982
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,859
Honey, I told you...

983
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:18,361
all black folk don't
necessarily know each other.

984
00:48:18,461 --> 00:48:23,500
- Could've fooled me.
- Do I look like Paul Bunyan or what?

985
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:27,614
Actually, you sure in the hell do.
And the Jolly Green Giant too. Ho-ho-ho.

986
00:48:28,271 --> 00:48:30,941
- Farmhand, please help me.
- His name is Conner.

987
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:32,075
Whew!

988
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:34,211
I think the tree...

989
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:36,279
would look good right here.

990
00:48:36,379 --> 00:48:38,548
If you don't mind me butting in...

991
00:48:38,648 --> 00:48:41,985
I think it would look really
pretty right here by the window...

992
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,754
and that way all the
passersby can enjoy it.

993
00:48:44,854 --> 00:48:47,424
That's where we had it every year.

994
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:49,993
- And who are you?
- That's a pretty tree.

995
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,262
I am... I'm Conner's mom.

996
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:55,841
That's Kim and that's Buddy.
These are Coroner's parents.

997
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:00,103
This is Eileen. I wanna scream.
I mean, Eileen.

998
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:05,175
Trees are for the family,
not for strangers.

999
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,277
What the hell these
people doing here?

1000
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:10,458
Mama, they came to visit
Conner for Christmas.

1001
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:16,553
Really? That is just
like my daughter.

1002
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:18,255
I raised you right.

1003
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:22,792
My daughter has always been
good with helping the help.

1004
00:49:22,892 --> 00:49:24,928
Yes.

1005
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:27,731
- Where you staying?
- We're thinking of staying here.

1006
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:30,467
Yeah. We drove all the
way up from Louisiana...

1007
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:33,204
to spend Christmas
with Conner and Lacey.

1008
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:37,114
It'll be a little cramped...

1009
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:39,612
but we'll make do.

1010
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:44,281
Madea and I will share a room.

1011
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:46,583
You, Buddy and...

1012
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:47,751
Kim.

1013
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:50,120
Kim, take another room...

1014
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,055
- and Carver...
- Conner.

1015
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,456
- That's what I said.
- Conner.

1016
00:49:53,556 --> 00:49:56,068
Yes, Carver, you can take the sofa.

1017
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,529
Let me get some decorations.

1018
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:02,132
Okay. I just...

1019
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:05,602
So many memories just coming
back to me bein' here.

1020
00:50:05,702 --> 00:50:09,673
To tell you, Lacey, my mama,
she loved this place. She did.

1021
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:12,742
I'm so happy you all came
back here to take care of it.

1022
00:50:12,842 --> 00:50:14,250
Welcome.

1023
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,314
Well, my daughter's
paying the mortgage...

1024
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:19,649
so I hope you bring
in a crop this year.

1025
00:50:19,749 --> 00:50:22,152
I told you not to buy this farm.

1026
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:26,189
That dam up north caused a lot of
problems this year for the farmers.

1027
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:29,893
But Conner, he's got him a new
strain of corn that takes less water.

1028
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:31,628
Now, how's that work, Conner?

1029
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:35,198
I studied agriculture
at New York State.

1030
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:36,833
Is that where you two met?

1031
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:38,568
Yeah. He's brilliant.

1032
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:41,471
Gets it from his old man.
Runs in the genes.

1033
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:44,841
At the science of it,
not so much the farming.

1034
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:48,211
So genius, little Einstein,
little Stephen Hawkins.

1035
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:51,314
We used to call him
"Smarty Britches" when he was little.

1036
00:50:51,414 --> 00:50:55,151
If you put some Viagra in that
tree's water, it'll stay up all year.

1037
00:50:55,251 --> 00:50:59,060
You better put some Viagra in your water.
See what happen with your tree.

1038
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:05,729
- All right, let's decorate.
- No, thank you. I can manage.

1039
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:08,631
I brought some decorations
from Atlanta...

1040
00:51:08,731 --> 00:51:11,067
and I work at one of the
finest department stores...

1041
00:51:11,167 --> 00:51:13,403
so I know a thing or two about taste.

1042
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:15,082
Where...

1043
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:17,474
Where did you get this tree?

1044
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,709
I mean, you have a beautiful
Christmas tree...

1045
00:51:19,809 --> 00:51:23,322
right outside the kitchen
window and none in the house.

1046
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:27,094
What's wrong?

1047
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:29,753
Please don't tell me that's
your granddaddy's tree.

1048
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:31,354
Oh, dear God.

1049
00:51:31,454 --> 00:51:34,524
Mama, was there a yellow ribbon
wrapped around that tree?

1050
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:36,465
Yes, and I cut it off.

1051
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:40,330
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1052
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,134
What happened? What?

1053
00:51:43,132 --> 00:51:45,168
My mama planted that tree...

1054
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:47,746
in memory of my granddaddy.

1055
00:51:51,841 --> 00:51:54,043
Well, how was I
supposed to know that?

1056
00:51:54,143 --> 00:51:55,879
This doesn't make any sense. Lacey.

1057
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:59,916
Did these people come
when you bought this land?

1058
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:03,893
This is your land now.
You can do what you want to with it.

1059
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:06,289
Excuse me.

1060
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:07,857
You don't look so good.

1061
00:52:07,957 --> 00:52:10,193
Feeling a little light-headed.

1062
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,195
Well, sit down then. Sit down.

1063
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,703
Okay.

1064
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:18,268
It's all these strange people
in this house, that's what it is.

1065
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:20,470
It ain't them people,
it's you! Hell, you!

1066
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:23,640
You lost your damn mind.
You done lost your damn mind!

1067
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:27,410
Anytime you see somebody with a
yellow ribbon on the tree, Eileen...

1068
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:30,146
a yellow ribbon,
that means a memoriam.

1069
00:52:30,246 --> 00:52:31,448
Don't you know what that means?

1070
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:33,917
Everybody in the USA knows
what a memoriam is...

1071
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:36,019
when you see a yellow
ribbon on a damn tree.

1072
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:37,687
You work on my nerves.

1073
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:41,090
That poor woman is probably crying
'cause you cut down her daddy's tree.

1074
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:43,159
What wrong with you,
cutting down her daddy's tree?

1075
00:52:43,259 --> 00:52:45,328
You know what's gonna happen?
I'm gonna make this plain.

1076
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:47,330
You're gonna go to bed,
slip into a coma...

1077
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,165
and everybody gonna wonder
what happened to you.

1078
00:52:49,265 --> 00:52:51,835
I did it. It's Christmas, damn it!

1079
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:54,871
I don't know, Buddy.
I don't think I can deal with this.

1080
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:57,307
I don't like it. It's wrong.

1081
00:52:57,407 --> 00:53:01,411
I can't pretend to be somebody.
I'm not an actress. I'm not Reba.

1082
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:04,280
Maybe we should just leave.
Let's pack up and leave tomorrow.

1083
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:06,282
No, we're not going back home.
We're staying here.

1084
00:53:06,382 --> 00:53:07,951
- It's Christmas.
- And that woman...

1085
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:11,855
she cuts down my daddy's memory tree
and acts like she doesn't even care!

1086
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:13,923
Honey, I know. It stinks. I get it.

1087
00:53:14,023 --> 00:53:15,992
You know what?
We'll get you another tree.

1088
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:19,128
I want that tree. I want my
daddy's tree. What about our son?

1089
00:53:19,228 --> 00:53:21,798
Conner just stands there and doesn't
say anything back to this woman.

1090
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:24,868
He's just pretending,
just saying nothin' to this woman.

1091
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:28,738
Sweetheart, you know our kid.
He can't tell no to anybody.

1092
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:30,306
Let him figure it out.

1093
00:53:30,406 --> 00:53:32,141
- You want some of this?
- No, not now.

1094
00:53:32,241 --> 00:53:35,378
- You know you want some of this.
- I don't. It's too much for me.

1095
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:37,380
Remember that game we
played when we was kids?

1096
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,449
- Mystery Date?
- No, the Ghost and the Damsel.

1097
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:41,518
- You remember that?
- Buddy Williams...

1098
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:44,654
We are not playing... This is not the
time or the place. Don't you dare.

1099
00:53:44,754 --> 00:53:47,023
Go take a cold shower
and get off of me.

1100
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:48,992
Go throw some milk on that thing.

1101
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:51,672
I think I left my bag in...

1102
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:54,709
one of my bags here.

1103
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:02,138
- You think she noticed me?
- Yes!

1104
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:04,875
- Yes!
- Oh, damn.

1105
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:11,080
How to stop diabetes before it starts.
That's what AARP talking about.

1106
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:13,260
You got to read this,
this is pretty good.

1107
00:54:23,092 --> 00:54:24,561
Eileen, what you doin'?

1108
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:26,162
I knew it.

1109
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:28,431
He's in the Ku Klux Klan.

1110
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:30,110
What?

1111
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,203
He was wearing the sheet
when I went in the room.

1112
00:54:34,303 --> 00:54:36,239
Them people are not
in no Ku Klux Klan.

1113
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:38,107
I saw the Klan today.
That ain't the Klan.

1114
00:54:38,207 --> 00:54:41,711
- They probably trying to make up the bed.
- I know the Klan when I see it.

1115
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:44,180
There you go, overreacting,
like you always do.

1116
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,758
- Yes, he is.
- Always jump to conclusions.

1117
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:48,918
Stop jumping to conclusions.

1118
00:54:49,018 --> 00:54:51,428
No, baby. No.

1119
00:54:52,021 --> 00:54:53,489
I know what I saw.

1120
00:54:53,589 --> 00:54:55,625
Eileen, you gonna
get your pressure up.

1121
00:54:55,725 --> 00:55:00,263
I'm gonna sleep with
one eye open tonight.

1122
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:04,601
Yes. Oh, Lord, my poor daughter,
she's so naive.

1123
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:07,470
She don't know what's going on.
She don't have a clue.

1124
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:10,373
You don't have a clue, talkin'
about sleeping with one eye open.

1125
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:13,142
I hope it's not the lazy one,
'cause that one always look closed.

1126
00:55:13,242 --> 00:55:15,044
Them people are not in the Klan.

1127
00:55:15,144 --> 00:55:17,313
You put all of this stuff
in front of that door.

1128
00:55:17,413 --> 00:55:19,048
All that stuff in
front the damn door.

1129
00:55:19,148 --> 00:55:22,385
I go to the bathroom, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, 10, 12 times a night...

1130
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,387
and if I laugh too hard,
I squirt pee.

1131
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:26,189
You got to move that stuff.

1132
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:29,666
How can I go to the bathroom at
night with all that in front the door?

1133
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:34,197
What this?

1134
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:37,071
- I can't sit on this cup!
- Then stand up.

1135
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:17,473
Conner, I'm sorry.

1136
00:56:17,573 --> 00:56:20,119
- Can I ask you something?
- What's that?

1137
00:56:22,211 --> 00:56:24,781
- Are you ashamed of me?
- No.

1138
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:27,016
Then why won't you tell her?

1139
00:56:27,116 --> 00:56:31,187
I've never let my mother
down my entire life. Okay?

1140
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:35,191
I've done everything
she wanted. Always.

1141
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:38,235
And this is the first time I've
done something that I want.

1142
00:56:39,762 --> 00:56:41,831
Conner, it's gonna break her heart.

1143
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:43,399
You gotta understand that.

1144
00:56:43,499 --> 00:56:46,002
You have to understand
how this makes me feel.

1145
00:56:46,102 --> 00:56:49,581
I love you. I'm proud of us.
I don't care who knows.

1146
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:56,915
- Are you coming to bed?
- You mean the sofa, right?

1147
00:56:57,513 --> 00:56:59,916
You know the walls are thin.

1148
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:02,221
My patience is getting
there with this.

1149
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:14,063
And I told her, "You better
get the hell on out the way."

1150
00:57:14,163 --> 00:57:16,432
Lord, that was funny.
Your mama was something else.

1151
00:57:16,532 --> 00:57:18,270
Here you are, Miss Murphy.

1152
00:57:19,635 --> 00:57:21,838
Three little eggs.

1153
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,745
Mama, it's fine.

1154
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:26,375
Would you like some coffee, Conner?

1155
00:57:26,475 --> 00:57:29,522
No, I gotta tend to the animals.

1156
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:35,551
I can give you a few
pointers if you want to.

1157
00:57:35,651 --> 00:57:37,553
- Yeah, that would be great.
- Okay, great.

1158
00:57:37,653 --> 00:57:39,733
All right. I'll be outside
if y'all need me.

1159
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:42,959
What kind of farmhand
don't know about farmin'?

1160
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:45,862
- He knows the science of it, Mama.
- No, I heard that last night.

1161
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:48,297
Wait. Why are you
always defending him?

1162
00:57:48,397 --> 00:57:50,977
'Cause she like him.

1163
00:57:52,401 --> 00:57:55,138
Over my dead body will she end
up with somebody like that.

1164
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:56,749
Somebody like what?

1165
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:01,110
I don't wanna talk about it. We don't
make those kind of jokes, okay?

1166
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:03,246
Hush up, Dragon Lady.
Hush the hell up.

1167
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:06,716
If she like him, she like him.
That's all that is. Just hush.

1168
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,618
Excuse me. Good morning, y'all.

1169
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:12,121
This room brings back
so many memories.

1170
00:58:12,221 --> 00:58:14,090
Smells like farm.

1171
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:15,658
Good morning, Miss Mandela.

1172
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:17,735
Not Mandela, honey. Madea.

1173
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,963
Madea, honey. Hi, sweetheart.

1174
00:58:21,063 --> 00:58:22,999
Mrs. Williams,
would you like some coffee?

1175
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:26,335
- I'm gonna get it myself.
- Don't you have to go to school?

1176
00:58:26,435 --> 00:58:29,605
Actually, I do. I'm on my way.
I'll talk to you later.

1177
00:58:29,705 --> 00:58:31,307
Bye, Miss Mandela.

1178
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:35,044
I had such a crazy,
crazy-ass dream last night.

1179
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:37,146
- Really?
- Yeah. What are you cooking?

1180
00:58:37,246 --> 00:58:40,183
- Can I help? I'm good in the kitchen.
- No, I don't need your help.

1181
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:41,259
Eileen!

1182
00:58:42,184 --> 00:58:44,355
What? I don't need her help.

1183
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:49,258
I understand. I like to cook
alone myself sometimes too.

1184
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:50,827
- Thank you.
- All right then.

1185
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:52,062
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1186
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:54,130
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.

1187
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:56,199
That ain't being Christian,
being that mean to that woman.

1188
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:58,936
I don't eat food from the KKK.

1189
00:58:59,535 --> 00:59:02,605
That woman ain't in no KKK.
Hush that foolishness. Hell.

1190
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:04,974
- I love you, Son.
- Love you too.

1191
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:06,676
Stay warm, okay?

1192
00:59:13,616 --> 00:59:16,697
- Stop babying him.
- You need to start babying him.

1193
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,288
What's the matter with you?

1194
00:59:19,388 --> 00:59:21,991
You did not need to be so
mean to that woman yesterday.

1195
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:24,293
She don't need to be
coming around here.

1196
00:59:24,393 --> 00:59:27,230
She seems nice. She just
wants the best for Bailey.

1197
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:29,966
I know what's the best for Bailey,
and that's keeping this place running.

1198
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,701
He can learn something in school.

1199
00:59:31,801 --> 00:59:34,237
Maybe become something
more than the two of us.

1200
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:37,213
Yeah? Well, school is
gonna have to wait.

1201
00:59:38,774 --> 00:59:40,576
Gotta get these "poinsetters" sold.

1202
00:59:40,676 --> 00:59:44,013
Think I'm gonna go down to Harrisburg.
Try sell 'em over there.

1203
00:59:44,113 --> 00:59:46,949
If you would have talked to Lacey,
you would've found out...

1204
00:59:47,049 --> 00:59:50,186
that she has got sponsorship for
the Jubilee, so it is happening.

1205
00:59:50,286 --> 00:59:52,655
So you can sell your
poinsettias at the Jubilee.

1206
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,960
- Who's the sponsor?
- I don't know.

1207
00:59:58,327 --> 01:00:00,396
Who does she think she is?

1208
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:02,498
What you mad for, huh?

1209
01:00:02,598 --> 01:00:04,600
The Jubilee is happening.

1210
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:07,737
We don't need her help.
She ain't from around here.

1211
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:11,073
- Well, that's just plain dumb.
- You watch your back talk, Amber.

1212
01:00:11,173 --> 01:00:13,549
And you watch your
front talk, Tanner.

1213
01:00:18,981 --> 01:00:20,583
- Hi.
- Hey.

1214
01:00:21,183 --> 01:00:22,921
Heard about the sponsorship?

1215
01:00:23,686 --> 01:00:25,655
Yeah, just found out about it.

1216
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:28,224
- We got a problem.
- What's that?

1217
01:00:28,324 --> 01:00:30,563
Sponsor is Sheldon Construction.

1218
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:36,766
Same Sheldon Construction that built
the dam that put us all out of business?

1219
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:40,277
- That's the one.
- Hell no. You see?

1220
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:42,949
Unbelievable.

1221
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:49,849
Child, these nipples so tough,
you need a mammogram.

1222
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:52,483
Don't look at me like that.

1223
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:55,184
- But you giving milk.
- Well, hello.

1224
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,564
Hey there.

1225
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:01,290
- How are ya?
- Thems pigs was starving to death.

1226
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:04,093
I slopped them, and I've been
trying to get milk for Eileen.

1227
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:06,629
- She's in there trying to cook something.
- Look, he's trying.

1228
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:09,832
- We sure do appreciate you helpin'.
- No. That's fine.

1229
01:01:09,932 --> 01:01:12,969
I'll show him how to do it when he
come out of that laboratory thing.

1230
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:15,604
Look like he growing marijuana.
He ain't growing marijuana, is he?

1231
01:01:15,704 --> 01:01:18,574
No, he ain't doing that.
Look, he's a smart kid, you know.

1232
01:01:18,674 --> 01:01:20,981
He just, well...

1233
01:01:22,244 --> 01:01:24,146
- What?
- I'm a truck driver.

1234
01:01:24,246 --> 01:01:26,716
I'm out on the road a lot,
you know, and...

1235
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:29,986
he always stayed with his mom
and his grandparents here.

1236
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:33,155
I tell you what, it broke my
heart to be gone so much...

1237
01:01:33,255 --> 01:01:37,360
but I just kind of feel a little
guilty about the way he turned out.

1238
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,929
- How he turn out?
- Kind of passive, I guess.

1239
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:42,231
Kind of lets people
walk all over him.

1240
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:46,435
I mean, he used to get beat
up a lot in school, bullied.

1241
01:01:46,535 --> 01:01:48,204
- Oh, he's soft.
- He's soft.

1242
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:50,840
This kid, Tanner, used to
beat him up all the time.

1243
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,842
And he still lives here, that Tanner.

1244
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:55,544
When a person gets tired of a bully,
they handle it, you understand?

1245
01:01:55,644 --> 01:01:59,081
You shut it down and you realize that
you ain't gonna deal with it no more.

1246
01:01:59,181 --> 01:02:01,784
- Boy, that's the truth.
- Gotta wait for that.

1247
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:04,220
Hey, we were just talking about you.

1248
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,788
- Yeah?
- It was all good stuff.

1249
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:07,857
- All good stuff.
- Good.

1250
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:10,594
That one, she just will
not let you milk her.

1251
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:14,166
- The black-and-white one?
- Yep.

1252
01:02:16,298 --> 01:02:19,902
There's a reason why you couldn't get
milk from the black-and-white one, son.

1253
01:02:21,937 --> 01:02:24,574
If somebody pull on your testicles,
will you give 'em milk?

1254
01:02:25,741 --> 01:02:26,842
Don't answer that.

1255
01:02:26,942 --> 01:02:29,645
That's a bull.
You can't milk no bull.

1256
01:02:29,745 --> 01:02:31,825
You serious, trying to milk a bull?

1257
01:02:32,948 --> 01:02:34,118
Blessed.

1258
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:37,820
Son, you got to slop them
pigs early in the morning.

1259
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,323
Then you gotta milk these cows
'cause they nipples is tough.

1260
01:02:41,423 --> 01:02:44,026
And you can't be gentle.
You got to pull them nipples.

1261
01:02:44,126 --> 01:02:46,195
You got to pull them things.
Pull 'em hard.

1262
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:48,731
Pull 'em. Pull 'em. Pull 'em.

1263
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:53,209
You're used to that. Hell, his mama
breast-fed him until he was in ninth grade.

1264
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:57,750
Shut your mouth! Ninth grade?
Her nipples ought to have corrosion.

1265
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:00,709
Yeah. That's right.
You ought to see them things.

1266
01:03:00,809 --> 01:03:02,978
They look like cake decorator bags.

1267
01:03:03,078 --> 01:03:05,948
Dad, stop it. Come on.

1268
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:09,652
Y'all, sometimes I just think
I'm not cut out for this.

1269
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:13,163
Well, hey, it's just a nipple!

1270
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:15,658
Daddy, I'm talking about farming.

1271
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:17,560
Well, hey, farming's hard, Son.

1272
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:19,569
Yes, farming's hard.
You know what else is hard?

1273
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:21,530
Keeping up a lie...

1274
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:24,266
'cause the longer you let it live,
the harder it is to kill.

1275
01:03:24,366 --> 01:03:26,168
- Ain't that right?
- You got that right.

1276
01:03:26,268 --> 01:03:28,104
You're a smart woman.

1277
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:31,107
- What are you talkin' about?
- What am I talkin' about?

1278
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:33,008
I'm talking about you and Lacey.

1279
01:03:33,108 --> 01:03:35,244
You wanna tell Eileen, or you
want me to tell her y'all together?

1280
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:37,481
- Daddy!
- Hey, I didn't say nothin'.

1281
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,748
- Who told you?
- You just did.

1282
01:03:39,848 --> 01:03:41,884
Whole body language. Tensed up.

1283
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:44,386
When I walked in the house
the other day, I saw them shoes.

1284
01:03:44,486 --> 01:03:46,822
I see the way you look at her,
the way she look at you.

1285
01:03:46,922 --> 01:03:49,458
- Y'all need to say something.
- It's not me. I wanna tell her.

1286
01:03:49,558 --> 01:03:52,461
It's Lacey. She says she doesn't
think she can handle it.

1287
01:03:52,561 --> 01:03:54,797
We just need a defibrillator.
She gonna have a heart attack.

1288
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:56,532
She gonna clutch the pearls and die.

1289
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:58,701
But we'll get a defibrillator.
She'll be all right.

1290
01:03:58,801 --> 01:04:00,881
But it's all right.
Y'all just dating.

1291
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:02,839
Dating?

1292
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:06,052
They're married.

1293
01:04:06,575 --> 01:04:08,086
Oh, she dead.

1294
01:04:08,844 --> 01:04:10,252
Flatline. Just...

1295
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,483
Dead. Lord have mercy,
that's going to kill her.

1296
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:16,919
Lacey said she's gonna
tell her on Christmas.

1297
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:18,921
She fixin' to kill her
mama on Christmas Day?

1298
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:21,624
- What kind of Christmas present is that?
- Oh, damn.

1299
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:24,527
Y'all better have some
nitroglycerin or something.

1300
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:26,595
That's a damn shame.
Gonna kill that woman on...

1301
01:04:26,695 --> 01:04:28,775
Hell, I'm stuck in the mud.

1302
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:32,668
Hell, this ain't mud!

1303
01:04:32,768 --> 01:04:35,314
- You all right?
- I done fell in bull...

1304
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:42,079
Keep going. Help each other out.

1305
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:45,915
- Hi. What's going on?
- It's bad.

1306
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:47,816
Oliver called and told the mayor...

1307
01:04:47,916 --> 01:04:51,921
that we couldn't have any references
to the nativity or Jesus.

1308
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:54,757
- What?
- The sponsors don't want it.

1309
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:57,459
No. No, something
is wrong. I'll call him.

1310
01:04:57,559 --> 01:04:59,639
Well, the mayor wants to see you now.

1311
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:02,672
- Come on.
- Okay.

1312
01:05:03,832 --> 01:05:05,570
Who does he think he is?

1313
01:05:07,269 --> 01:05:09,038
All right! That's enough!

1314
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:11,307
That's enough!

1315
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:13,142
One at a time!

1316
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:14,877
I'm very upset.

1317
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:17,379
She is trying to take
Christ out of Christmas.

1318
01:05:17,479 --> 01:05:20,216
Next thing you know they'll
wanna take prayer out of church!

1319
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:22,284
You see what happened when
they took prayer out of schools.

1320
01:05:22,384 --> 01:05:23,352
We did.

1321
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:25,721
Wilbur, what does it say?

1322
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:29,358
Well, the contract says...
no nativity.

1323
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:31,994
No Jesus reference whatsoever.

1324
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:34,496
Not even a little drummer boy.

1325
01:05:34,596 --> 01:05:36,065
Unbelievable.

1326
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:38,167
Why didn't it say that the
first time you read it?

1327
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:40,436
Well, it was in the small print.

1328
01:05:40,536 --> 01:05:42,504
I didn't have my glasses on.

1329
01:05:42,604 --> 01:05:45,040
I didn't have my glasses on!
I couldn't see!

1330
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:46,875
- This is awful!
- Wait.

1331
01:05:46,975 --> 01:05:49,055
This has got to be a mistake.

1332
01:05:49,678 --> 01:05:51,780
Let me call Oliver. How about that?

1333
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:54,183
All righty. You go right ahead.

1334
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:56,418
I've already talked to him
about this, but have at it.

1335
01:05:56,518 --> 01:05:57,926
Okay.

1336
01:05:58,854 --> 01:06:00,865
- Put it on speaker.
- Yeah.

1337
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:02,936
Okay.

1338
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,202
Hello?

1339
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:16,605
- Hi Oliver.
- Hey. Guess you talked to the mayor.

1340
01:06:16,705 --> 01:06:19,775
Yes, we are all here on speakerphone.

1341
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:22,077
Yeah, I don't see
what the big deal is.

1342
01:06:22,177 --> 01:06:24,980
They want it to be called Holiday
Jubilee instead of Christmas.

1343
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,283
Yeah, and they don't need
references to religious figures.

1344
01:06:27,383 --> 01:06:30,286
How do we talk about Christmas
without talking about Jesus?

1345
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:32,621
- Yeah, how do we?
- It happens all the time,

1346
01:06:32,721 --> 01:06:34,690
Santa Claus is okay.

1347
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:37,461
Make it about Santa Claus and
not about the birth of Christ.

1348
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:42,731
And the songs for the Jubilee should
be about everything but Christ.

1349
01:06:42,831 --> 01:06:46,001
Sing songs like Here Comes
Santa Claus, White Christmas.

1350
01:06:46,101 --> 01:06:47,536
White Christmas.

1351
01:06:47,636 --> 01:06:50,539
There ain't nothing white about
a Bucktussle, Alabama Christmas!

1352
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:52,374
- It don't snow here!
- That's right.

1353
01:06:52,474 --> 01:06:55,544
Okay, Oliver, we did not
sign up for this. Okay?

1354
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:57,112
Yes, you did.

1355
01:06:57,212 --> 01:06:59,417
I am a Christian,
and this is some bull...

1356
01:07:03,018 --> 01:07:05,287
The heads of the company are
coming down on a private jet...

1357
01:07:05,387 --> 01:07:06,522
A private jet.

1358
01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:08,357
To be filmed with the
school at the Jubilee,

1359
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:10,492
I did you a favor here,
and this will ruin me.

1360
01:07:10,592 --> 01:07:12,494
You can't do this to me now.

1361
01:07:12,594 --> 01:07:16,665
I can't just turn them around.
You have to figure this one out.

1362
01:07:16,765 --> 01:07:19,168
- You hold on there, son.
- That's right. You get it straight.

1363
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:22,171
With all due respect, Mr. Mayor,
you got the money and we have a deal.

1364
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:24,239
- Give him his money back.
- Yeah.

1365
01:07:24,339 --> 01:07:25,808
- We spent it.
- Yeah.

1366
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:27,543
- On what?
- The Jubilee!

1367
01:07:27,643 --> 01:07:31,213
And much-needed school supplies.
And catching up on school bills.

1368
01:07:31,313 --> 01:07:34,116
Listen, I'm sorry, but we're coming.

1369
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:36,552
This is my career
you're talking about.

1370
01:07:36,652 --> 01:07:38,231
I'll see you tomorrow.

1371
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:40,956
Move, move. Now, watch out.

1372
01:07:41,056 --> 01:07:45,094
Well, now this is a fine
mess you've gotten us into.

1373
01:07:45,194 --> 01:07:46,662
She should be fired.

1374
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:49,031
- Now hold on a second.
- Mr. Mayor...

1375
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:50,599
have you heard?

1376
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:52,668
We were talking about the
changes they want made.

1377
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:56,475
That's not what I was talking about.
I was talking about the sponsor.

1378
01:07:57,272 --> 01:07:59,174
- Sheldon Construction.
- What?

1379
01:07:59,274 --> 01:08:00,743
That's right.

1380
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:02,311
The same folks...

1381
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:05,647
that built a dam to save Jasper
and left us without a river.

1382
01:08:05,747 --> 01:08:07,750
She brought this mess here
and she should be fired.

1383
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:09,651
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring...

1384
01:08:09,751 --> 01:08:13,422
We don't care what the
hell you meant. Do we?

1385
01:08:13,522 --> 01:08:15,023
- No.
- I didn't think so.

1386
01:08:15,123 --> 01:08:17,159
You brought an awful situation here.

1387
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:19,361
Get out of here and let us handle it.

1388
01:08:19,461 --> 01:08:21,764
- Go back to wherever you come from.
- Now hold on.

1389
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:23,671
You do not have to
talk to her like that.

1390
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:25,912
Mr. Mayor.

1391
01:08:26,835 --> 01:08:29,104
You fire her. Right now.

1392
01:08:29,204 --> 01:08:31,045
Do it.

1393
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:36,146
- Lacey, I'm sorry.
- There we go.

1394
01:08:38,146 --> 01:08:39,725
I understand.

1395
01:08:43,151 --> 01:08:45,521
You believe that? Sheldon.

1396
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:47,530
This is a hell of a mess.

1397
01:08:57,766 --> 01:08:59,903
You all do your homework, okay?

1398
01:09:01,403 --> 01:09:04,677
And... be good for your new teacher.

1399
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:08,321
Where are you going?

1400
01:09:10,746 --> 01:09:12,484
I made a mistake...

1401
01:09:13,615 --> 01:09:15,417
and now I have to leave.

1402
01:09:15,517 --> 01:09:19,394
No. I'll sing. I'll do the solo.

1403
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:23,559
I don't think there's gonna be
a Christmas Jubilee this year.

1404
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:25,661
I don't want you to go.

1405
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:28,063
Bailey, you are so special.

1406
01:09:28,163 --> 01:09:30,641
You always remember that.

1407
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:34,837
- Okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

1408
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:36,516
You all are.

1409
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:40,386
I'll see you.

1410
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:44,547
- I'm so sorry.
- It's fine.

1411
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:50,754
Good job, boys.

1412
01:09:58,594 --> 01:10:00,562
I just got done telling Madea...

1413
01:10:00,662 --> 01:10:03,799
that you was in here all alone
with Eileen, and she said that...

1414
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:06,946
I said you was in here with
the beast of the southern wild.

1415
01:10:08,503 --> 01:10:10,706
I tried. That woman is stubborn.

1416
01:10:10,806 --> 01:10:13,375
I tried. I asked her if
I could help her cook.

1417
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:14,943
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

1418
01:10:15,043 --> 01:10:16,945
Yeah, I know. She's difficult.

1419
01:10:17,045 --> 01:10:19,014
It's all right. She got a problem,
but it's all right.

1420
01:10:19,114 --> 01:10:21,283
- Y'all want some lemonade?
- No, I'm good.

1421
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:23,018
- I'm good. Thank you.
- There you are.

1422
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:25,521
I've been worried about you.

1423
01:10:25,621 --> 01:10:28,590
You were out there
with them for a while.

1424
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:30,659
Yeah. I was conflicted.

1425
01:10:30,759 --> 01:10:35,397
I didn't know if I should look
for you or watch the food.

1426
01:10:35,497 --> 01:10:38,100
I didn't let her near our food.

1427
01:10:39,034 --> 01:10:43,071
You whisper like a damn bullhorn.
That woman ain't gonna hurt us.

1428
01:10:43,171 --> 01:10:45,140
We don't know that, do we?

1429
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,875
What y'all talking about over there?

1430
01:10:46,975 --> 01:10:49,282
She just thinks y'all
are tryin' to kill us.

1431
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:52,281
- Tryin' to kill you?
- Good heavens!

1432
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:54,850
- You're nuts!
- I've never hurt a flea or a fly.

1433
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:56,919
I've seen her shoot
a deer once though.

1434
01:10:57,019 --> 01:11:00,322
I never. I would never shoot little
Bambi sipping water in a pond.

1435
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:03,358
I'm just gonna ask y'all.
I'm gonna put it out on the table.

1436
01:11:03,458 --> 01:11:04,826
- Be honest.
- What is it?

1437
01:11:04,926 --> 01:11:06,664
Y'all in the Ku Klux Klan?

1438
01:11:07,462 --> 01:11:09,431
- That's what she wanna know.
- Get outta here!

1439
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:11,500
Heavens no. Why would she...

1440
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,369
- Buddy, the other night with the sheet.
- Oh, with the sheet!

1441
01:11:14,469 --> 01:11:15,971
Yes! Explain that.

1442
01:11:16,071 --> 01:11:18,040
We used to play this game, all right?

1443
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,042
Buddy and I, when we
were young, he would...

1444
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:22,778
It was called the
Ghost and the Damsel.

1445
01:11:22,878 --> 01:11:24,846
And he would blindfold me.

1446
01:11:24,946 --> 01:11:27,416
Then he'd put a sheet
above himself...

1447
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:29,551
and then I would have
to search about...

1448
01:11:29,651 --> 01:11:31,687
and capture the rapture,
if you know what I mean.

1449
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,355
Mama!

1450
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:34,957
I am sorry, Conner.

1451
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:37,326
- That's just nasty.
- Sorry, Son.

1452
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:39,561
- But I like it.
- I know.

1453
01:11:39,661 --> 01:11:42,030
It can be fun. It can be.

1454
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:44,967
That is so inappropriate.

1455
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:48,637
You two need to learn how to
respect my daughter's house.

1456
01:11:49,504 --> 01:11:52,274
- Eileen, you might wanna let that go.
- No.

1457
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:54,443
They come in here taking
advantage of her...

1458
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:57,946
eating her food, and they're
acting like they own the place.

1459
01:11:58,046 --> 01:12:00,215
- I don't like it.
- You need to let that go.

1460
01:12:00,315 --> 01:12:02,918
Well, I don't like...

1461
01:12:03,018 --> 01:12:05,187
- Mama...
- that you...

1462
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:06,755
Mama, sit down.

1463
01:12:06,855 --> 01:12:09,391
You cut down my family's memory tree.

1464
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:11,460
That's what I don't like.

1465
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,061
Excuse me?

1466
01:12:13,161 --> 01:12:16,164
I can deal with a lot of things.
They know it.

1467
01:12:16,264 --> 01:12:18,700
But this is downright wrong...

1468
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,744
and now I am getting very upset!

1469
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:25,741
Why would you plant his memory
tree on my daughter's land...

1470
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:27,809
and how was I supposed to know that?

1471
01:12:27,909 --> 01:12:29,878
Oh, I don't know.

1472
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:32,981
Maybe because it had a
yellow ribbon around it?

1473
01:12:33,081 --> 01:12:34,683
That doesn't mean anything.

1474
01:12:34,783 --> 01:12:38,220
In most countries, in most places,
to sane-thinking people...

1475
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,989
a yellow ribbon means something.

1476
01:12:41,089 --> 01:12:45,060
Now you just calm down, missy. Okay?

1477
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:49,164
Now, Lacey, are you gonna
let her talk to me like this?

1478
01:12:49,264 --> 01:12:51,166
- Mama, calm down.
- Put your finger down...

1479
01:12:51,266 --> 01:12:53,505
or I will cut it off and deep-fry it!

1480
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:57,339
You need to leave my
daughter's house.

1481
01:12:57,439 --> 01:12:59,307
- Mama, stop it! Stop!
- No!

1482
01:12:59,407 --> 01:13:01,276
Eileen, you need to
stop right now, honey.

1483
01:13:01,376 --> 01:13:04,212
What are they doing here anyway?
Tomorrow is Christmas!

1484
01:13:04,312 --> 01:13:05,847
They are not your family!

1485
01:13:05,947 --> 01:13:08,183
- Let's get out of here.
- No, hold up.

1486
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:10,585
Come on back here.
Ain't nobody going nowhere.

1487
01:13:10,685 --> 01:13:13,321
- Now, Madea...
- Ain't nobody goin' no damn where.

1488
01:13:13,421 --> 01:13:15,390
Madea, whose side are you on?

1489
01:13:15,490 --> 01:13:17,859
- Let 'em leave.
- No, I'm on the side of right.

1490
01:13:17,959 --> 01:13:20,062
- That's the side I'm on. Lacey?
- Yes.

1491
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:23,165
- Tell your mama.
- What? Tell me what?

1492
01:13:23,265 --> 01:13:26,505
Spit it out before I punch you,
put your teeth down your throat!

1493
01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:31,981
Mama... Conner and I are married.

1494
01:13:36,077 --> 01:13:38,487
- Catch her.
- Get the defibrillator.

1495
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:46,231
Lacey. Your father.

1496
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:50,192
I know, Mama. I know he was
murdered by a white man, but...

1497
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:51,793
- What happened?
- What?

1498
01:13:51,893 --> 01:13:55,163
My father was killed by a
white man on Christmas Eve...

1499
01:13:55,263 --> 01:13:57,065
trying to protect my mother's honor.

1500
01:13:57,165 --> 01:13:59,167
- That's awful.
- Good Lord.

1501
01:13:59,267 --> 01:14:02,270
- Who told you that?
- Mama.

1502
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:05,540
Eileen, you oughta be ashamed...
Child, that's some straight-up bull...

1503
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,048
Madea!

1504
01:14:07,642 --> 01:14:10,222
Your daddy wasn't
killed by no white man.

1505
01:14:10,812 --> 01:14:13,181
He left your mama for a white
woman when you was two...

1506
01:14:13,281 --> 01:14:15,617
and your mama has been bitter
with white people ever since.

1507
01:14:15,717 --> 01:14:17,185
- What?
- Yes, years ago.

1508
01:14:17,285 --> 01:14:21,590
Ran off and joined the circus.
And now they on Glee,

1509
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:23,158
Good show.

1510
01:14:23,258 --> 01:14:26,100
Glee? Mama, is this true?

1511
01:14:27,028 --> 01:14:28,697
Mama!

1512
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:34,436
Lacey, I am so disappointed in you.

1513
01:14:34,536 --> 01:14:36,912
Look at her trying to
turn it around on you.

1514
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:39,485
Girl, please.

1515
01:14:44,246 --> 01:14:46,053
You're disappointed in me?

1516
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:49,050
Well, that went well.

1517
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:51,457
At least she didn't have
another heart attack.

1518
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:55,157
- Another one?
- Yeah, Madea.

1519
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:58,160
Didn't you know that my mother
had a heart attack last year?

1520
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:00,395
Your mama lied to you. She had gas.

1521
01:15:00,495 --> 01:15:03,331
Got to the doctor, she was clutching
her heart and the pearls.

1522
01:15:03,431 --> 01:15:05,734
Got there, doctor say it's gas.

1523
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:09,337
- Wait, what?
- They put one of them rods up there.

1524
01:15:09,437 --> 01:15:12,307
Came flowing out like the River Jordan
and that was it. It was all over.

1525
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:13,875
I had that once too.

1526
01:15:13,975 --> 01:15:16,478
Put it in there, come out sounding
like brakes coming out of...

1527
01:15:16,578 --> 01:15:18,988
The air pressure coming
out of one of them big rigs.

1528
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:22,250
There it is. Then they tell
her she had heartburn.

1529
01:15:22,350 --> 01:15:25,086
- She didn't have no heart attack.
- She had heartburn?

1530
01:15:25,186 --> 01:15:27,823
She needs some of that Prilosec OTC.

1531
01:15:29,257 --> 01:15:31,927
She been manipulating you.
She as healthy as an ox.

1532
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:34,129
Well, that woman's a
pretty pissed off ox.

1533
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:36,609
Don't get behind her.

1534
01:15:37,999 --> 01:15:41,002
Don't light a match. Don't get
her next to an open flame.

1535
01:15:41,102 --> 01:15:42,571
We'll all have burnt heads.

1536
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:45,342
Yeah, her farts can spell
her name, they so bad.

1537
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:51,681
- Mama, he got her fired.
- That's all right. I'm upset too.

1538
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:54,951
We should go, boy. We got work to do.

1539
01:15:57,886 --> 01:16:00,088
Why'd you do that to Mrs. Williams?

1540
01:16:00,188 --> 01:16:03,158
You know, she's a nice lady.
Why'd you get her fired?

1541
01:16:03,258 --> 01:16:05,293
You don't know what's
going on here, Bailey.

1542
01:16:05,393 --> 01:16:07,896
I know you don't like people
'cause of the way they look.

1543
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:10,940
That ain't right! That's what
kids do to me at school!

1544
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:15,509
It ain't fair. She's nice to me.

1545
01:16:16,871 --> 01:16:18,707
Don't you ever...

1546
01:16:18,807 --> 01:16:20,775
talk to me like that again.

1547
01:16:20,875 --> 01:16:22,644
You hear me?

1548
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:24,824
Get out on that plow.

1549
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:32,420
He is right, and you know it.

1550
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,422
She made a deal with the devil.

1551
01:16:34,522 --> 01:16:37,359
No, you're actin' more like
the devil than she is.

1552
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:39,539
And this is Christmas, Tanner.

1553
01:16:50,839 --> 01:16:54,242
This child still sitting out there.
That's just crazy as hell.

1554
01:16:54,342 --> 01:16:55,810
Where y'all going?

1555
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:57,679
Well, Miss Media,
we're gonna bring her...

1556
01:16:57,779 --> 01:16:59,247
My name is Madea, honey.

1557
01:16:59,347 --> 01:17:00,815
- Madea.
- Thank you.

1558
01:17:00,915 --> 01:17:03,418
We're gonna bring her hot chocolate
to warm her hard, hard heart.

1559
01:17:03,518 --> 01:17:05,757
Hot chocolate does wonders.
It's delicious.

1560
01:17:06,421 --> 01:17:09,291
That's what got y'all in trouble,
the hot chocolate.

1561
01:17:09,391 --> 01:17:11,493
Your son with the hot chocolate.

1562
01:17:11,593 --> 01:17:13,561
I'm telling you. Let me
explain something to you.

1563
01:17:13,661 --> 01:17:15,463
Let me make this clear to y'all.

1564
01:17:15,563 --> 01:17:17,532
Leave her out there.
She is grown, sitting there.

1565
01:17:17,632 --> 01:17:20,602
If she want to come in the house,
she know how to get in. Leave her alone.

1566
01:17:20,702 --> 01:17:23,438
We're gonna go out and try.
We'll talk to her a bit.

1567
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:25,006
Go on. Go on.

1568
01:17:25,106 --> 01:17:27,042
Okay. You better wear a cup.

1569
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:28,721
That's comforting.

1570
01:17:35,683 --> 01:17:37,786
Boy, this is something else,
isn't it? It's freezing.

1571
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:39,888
Remember, Buddy,
kill her with kindness.

1572
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:41,957
My weenie is an inny right now.

1573
01:17:42,057 --> 01:17:45,593
Try to have as much charm with your
voice as you do with your weenie.

1574
01:17:45,693 --> 01:17:48,396
Well, tell you what.
I ain't used to this cold weather.

1575
01:17:48,496 --> 01:17:50,632
I know. All right?

1576
01:17:50,732 --> 01:17:52,701
I'm gonna have to wipe
with an ice scraper tonight.

1577
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:55,103
Smile's all in patience.
Ask the Lord.

1578
01:17:55,203 --> 01:17:57,305
Lord, help us. The Serenity Prayer.

1579
01:17:57,405 --> 01:18:01,176
There ain't no cabs out here.
You wanna come back in the house?

1580
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:02,811
I'm fine right here.

1581
01:18:02,911 --> 01:18:05,389
I made you some pipin' hot chocolate.

1582
01:18:06,047 --> 01:18:08,917
Thank you. I don't
want any chocolate.

1583
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:10,755
My son likes chocolate.

1584
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:15,256
Go ahead and laugh. This is awful.

1585
01:18:15,356 --> 01:18:18,093
What's so awful about it?

1586
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:21,796
What world are you living in?
They are asking for trouble.

1587
01:18:21,896 --> 01:18:23,331
Eileen, I...

1588
01:18:23,431 --> 01:18:25,600
Mrs. Murphy to you.

1589
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:28,670
Miss Murphy, you can take a knife
and cut all three of us right now.

1590
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:30,739
You know what's gonna happen?
We're gonna bleed red.

1591
01:18:30,839 --> 01:18:33,241
Blood red. We're all the same inside.

1592
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:35,010
That's true.

1593
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:38,384
Mrs. Murphy, if I may...

1594
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:43,451
our children, no matter what we think,
they will live their own lives.

1595
01:18:44,552 --> 01:18:47,155
- The world is changing.
- Not that much.

1596
01:18:47,255 --> 01:18:50,859
It is changing,
and that is a good thing.

1597
01:18:50,959 --> 01:18:54,696
Every generation sees
a little less division...

1598
01:18:54,796 --> 01:18:59,902
and a little more open
minds and open hearts.

1599
01:19:01,035 --> 01:19:04,005
I think we should be
happy and proud...

1600
01:19:04,105 --> 01:19:06,541
that our kids, our children...

1601
01:19:06,641 --> 01:19:10,245
see people as people.

1602
01:19:10,812 --> 01:19:12,147
That was beautiful.

1603
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:14,315
- That was unbelievable.
- Thank you. I mean it.

1604
01:19:14,415 --> 01:19:17,085
Come in the house and get
to know us. We're good folks.

1605
01:19:17,185 --> 01:19:20,021
I know damn well you hear
me calling you. Eileen!

1606
01:19:20,121 --> 01:19:21,856
Traitor!

1607
01:19:21,956 --> 01:19:23,892
- Satan!
- Judas!

1608
01:19:23,992 --> 01:19:25,593
Beelzebub!

1609
01:19:25,693 --> 01:19:27,195
Come in. It is cold.

1610
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:29,898
You got these people out here trying
to tempt you back in the house...

1611
01:19:29,998 --> 01:19:33,068
like a wet cat on a cold Sunday
morning who needs some milk.

1612
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:34,803
Come in the house.
You're out here freezing.

1613
01:19:34,903 --> 01:19:38,306
Your ankles is whiter than snow.
Look like you been kicking flour.

1614
01:19:38,406 --> 01:19:40,747
My gosh, they are white.
Look, we are related.

1615
01:19:41,676 --> 01:19:45,080
I will not step into
that house of lies.

1616
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:47,816
The girl is married. You can't
control every minute of her life.

1617
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:49,651
Do you understand? It is Christmas.

1618
01:19:49,751 --> 01:19:53,221
Give this child the gift of being
able to do whatever she want to do.

1619
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:56,391
You can't run her life for her.
Do you understand that?

1620
01:19:56,491 --> 01:19:59,060
Ain't no cab comin'. You gonna
be sitting out here freezin'.

1621
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:02,030
We gonna come out here tomorrow,
you gonna be a black Statue of Liberty...

1622
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:03,765
just sitting down on your ass.

1623
01:20:03,865 --> 01:20:06,101
Come on in the house!
You know what? That's fine.

1624
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:08,203
You don't want to come in
'cause you mad about something?

1625
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:10,305
You can't get everything your way.

1626
01:20:10,405 --> 01:20:13,575
You ever woke up on Christmas morning
and didn't get the gift you wanted?

1627
01:20:13,675 --> 01:20:16,811
This is it. You didn't get the gift you
wanted. Bring your ass in the house.

1628
01:20:16,911 --> 01:20:19,147
Y'all wastin' your time,
'cause she stubborn as a mule.

1629
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:22,484
I'm going in. You wanna sit out here
and freeze, sit your ass out here...

1630
01:20:22,584 --> 01:20:24,886
sit your ass out here and freeze!

1631
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:27,122
Sit there as long as you want.
I don't give a damn.

1632
01:20:27,222 --> 01:20:29,190
Sit there and turn
into a damn Popsicle!

1633
01:20:29,290 --> 01:20:32,327
Freeze all the hell you want.
You done lost your damn mind!

1634
01:20:32,427 --> 01:20:33,835
Amen.

1635
01:20:37,565 --> 01:20:40,969
Come on inside. You'll freeze
to death. Ain't no cab coming.

1636
01:20:41,069 --> 01:20:43,371
- I can't believe that.
- We tried our best.

1637
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:45,507
Let's go in and play
charades with Madea.

1638
01:20:45,607 --> 01:20:47,687
Then I will walk to town.

1639
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:51,151
And I'll take the Greyhound bus.

1640
01:20:56,584 --> 01:21:00,063
I don't need none of them.
Not one of them.

1641
01:21:05,126 --> 01:21:06,534
Hey.

1642
01:21:08,463 --> 01:21:10,999
Your mama's still out in the cold.
You may want to talk to her.

1643
01:21:11,099 --> 01:21:14,002
- She doesn't want to talk to me.
- You sure about that?

1644
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:15,737
I know my mother.

1645
01:21:15,837 --> 01:21:18,373
Apparently you don't know
her as well as you think.

1646
01:21:18,473 --> 01:21:20,441
And what's that supposed to mean?

1647
01:21:20,541 --> 01:21:24,012
She's been manipulating
you your entire life.

1648
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:28,016
She lied to you about your daddy
and about her heart attacks.

1649
01:21:28,116 --> 01:21:29,584
It's just not right.

1650
01:21:29,684 --> 01:21:31,586
Can you stop talking
about my mother now?

1651
01:21:31,686 --> 01:21:34,889
I'm not talkin' about your mother.
I'm just statin' the obvious.

1652
01:21:34,989 --> 01:21:36,791
I'm not trying to attack you or her.

1653
01:21:36,891 --> 01:21:39,027
Good, because I've been
attacked enough today.

1654
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:43,464
Between my mother and my job and...
It's just all a bit much.

1655
01:21:43,564 --> 01:21:46,167
And everybody's mad at me
because of the sponsor...

1656
01:21:46,267 --> 01:21:49,007
I didn't know it was from
Sheldon Construction Company.

1657
01:21:49,704 --> 01:21:51,784
Tanner McCoy. Yeah, okay.

1658
01:21:52,707 --> 01:21:55,048
- What about Tanner?
- Nothing.

1659
01:21:55,843 --> 01:21:58,219
- Baby.
- I said "nothing."

1660
01:21:59,314 --> 01:22:01,394
What did Tanner do?

1661
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:06,388
He was so nasty.
And then he got me fired.

1662
01:22:09,223 --> 01:22:11,360
- Conner.
- Son of a bitch.

1663
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,562
Conner, where are you going?

1664
01:22:14,662 --> 01:22:17,398
- Hey, what's going on?
- I mentioned Tanner and he lost it.

1665
01:22:17,498 --> 01:22:19,968
- Conner!
- I've been waiting to see this.

1666
01:22:20,068 --> 01:22:22,070
- I'm goin' with you, boy.
- Conner!

1667
01:22:29,270 --> 01:22:30,604
Conner!

1668
01:22:40,188 --> 01:22:44,092
Hot dog, it's cold out here.
It's all right. It's all right then.

1669
01:22:44,192 --> 01:22:45,600
Help!

1670
01:22:48,996 --> 01:22:53,434
What in the...
Oh, Jesus, no, you don't.

1671
01:22:53,534 --> 01:22:57,805
- Hey.
- Someone there? Hello?

1672
01:22:57,905 --> 01:22:59,609
I'm here.

1673
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:03,722
I can't move.

1674
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:08,017
All right now. We gotta
get outta here. Come on.

1675
01:23:09,517 --> 01:23:10,985
- I'm stuck.
- Can you move your...

1676
01:23:11,085 --> 01:23:12,630
My leg's caught.

1677
01:23:13,821 --> 01:23:15,400
I don't wanna die.

1678
01:23:16,023 --> 01:23:18,103
- Nobody's gonna die.
- I have a little boy.

1679
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:21,573
Push.

1680
01:23:23,564 --> 01:23:25,400
I got you.

1681
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,602
Got it.

1682
01:23:29,036 --> 01:23:30,706
Go ahead.

1683
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:35,087
I got you.

1684
01:23:58,299 --> 01:24:01,608
You're good. How are your legs? Okay.

1685
01:24:03,704 --> 01:24:05,173
- How's your head?
- All right.

1686
01:24:05,273 --> 01:24:08,115
All right. Get up. Get up.

1687
01:24:09,944 --> 01:24:12,024
Help. Help.

1688
01:24:13,815 --> 01:24:16,361
Get off my mother-in-law,
you son of a bitch!

1689
01:24:17,618 --> 01:24:20,221
- Hey! Don't hurt him! Stop it!
- Leave him be!

1690
01:24:20,321 --> 01:24:21,856
Come on!

1691
01:24:21,956 --> 01:24:25,393
Don't you ever, ever say a word to
my wife again. You understand me?

1692
01:24:25,493 --> 01:24:28,196
- What did he say about Lacey?
- Get in the truck.

1693
01:24:28,296 --> 01:24:30,198
I will not step foot
back in that house!

1694
01:24:30,298 --> 01:24:32,266
I am not in the mood
for your foolishness.

1695
01:24:32,366 --> 01:24:34,070
Now get your ass in that truck!

1696
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:38,139
Now I'm plantin' corn...

1697
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:41,582
and there ain't a damn
thing you can do about it.

1698
01:24:52,687 --> 01:24:54,266
Get out of here.

1699
01:25:09,103 --> 01:25:11,005
Babe, I wish you
wouldn't have done that.

1700
01:25:11,105 --> 01:25:12,407
It had to be done.

1701
01:25:12,507 --> 01:25:15,410
Nothing stops somebody like him from
bullying people except pushing back.

1702
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:19,147
That's right. That kid's been a terror
to Conner since he was a little boy.

1703
01:25:19,247 --> 01:25:22,016
I'm glad you done what you did, Son.
I'm proud of you.

1704
01:25:22,116 --> 01:25:24,719
Stood up for himself,
and that's a good thing.

1705
01:25:24,819 --> 01:25:26,421
I'm with you, Lacey. I don't like it.

1706
01:25:26,521 --> 01:25:28,489
I just wanna tell you
all how sorry I am.

1707
01:25:28,589 --> 01:25:30,925
I should have told my
mom from the beginning.

1708
01:25:31,025 --> 01:25:33,528
That is the truth.
You should've told her.

1709
01:25:33,628 --> 01:25:36,464
We have met your mama
and we understand.

1710
01:25:36,564 --> 01:25:38,533
She crazy as hell. Didn't I tell you?

1711
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:40,770
- She's cuckoo.
- That's right.

1712
01:25:41,736 --> 01:25:44,038
I don't like you all
talking about me.

1713
01:25:44,138 --> 01:25:45,773
No, Mrs. Murphy, I'm sorry.

1714
01:25:45,873 --> 01:25:48,609
We were just saying that God
makes everyone different...

1715
01:25:48,709 --> 01:25:51,790
and you are a gem in God's ring.

1716
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:57,151
And I don't like the
way you spoke to me.

1717
01:25:57,251 --> 01:25:59,954
Well, I'm sorry. I was angry.

1718
01:26:00,054 --> 01:26:04,225
- What did you say?
- He told her to get her ass in the truck.

1719
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:07,565
- And what did you do?
- She got her ass in the truck.

1720
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:10,765
Go ahead and laugh.

1721
01:26:10,865 --> 01:26:13,000
Hold on, Eileen.
Y'all need to let all this go.

1722
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:16,070
You lied. She done lie. Everybody lied.
Here a lie, there a lie.

1723
01:26:16,170 --> 01:26:19,073
It's Christmas now. You need to
go down there and buy her a tree.

1724
01:26:19,173 --> 01:26:21,642
And plant it in the backyard.
Get her a ribbon.

1725
01:26:21,742 --> 01:26:23,211
- A yellow one.
- I'm sorry.

1726
01:26:23,311 --> 01:26:26,113
I just wanted to give my
daughter a proper wedding.

1727
01:26:26,213 --> 01:26:28,649
Mama, you've always been overbearing.

1728
01:26:28,749 --> 01:26:31,619
I did it for me. Not for you.

1729
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:34,555
I love you, and I'm sorry...

1730
01:26:34,655 --> 01:26:36,824
that I didn't tell you,
but this is my life.

1731
01:26:36,924 --> 01:26:40,528
And he loves me,
and he treats me oh so well.

1732
01:26:40,628 --> 01:26:43,764
I'm sorry. I just didn't
want you to get hurt.

1733
01:26:43,864 --> 01:26:47,502
Mama, he's not gonna hurt me.
He's as gentle as a lamb.

1734
01:26:49,236 --> 01:26:52,249
No, he's not. He beat that
man down to the ground.

1735
01:26:52,707 --> 01:26:55,977
Come on. That guy had it comin',
and everybody knows it.

1736
01:26:56,077 --> 01:26:58,987
Well, he did say he
was protecting you.

1737
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:01,549
I love your daughter, Miss Murphy.

1738
01:27:01,649 --> 01:27:04,785
I'll never let anything
happen to her. I promise.

1739
01:27:04,885 --> 01:27:06,521
That makes two of us.

1740
01:27:06,621 --> 01:27:11,830
Okay. Well, this is all new to me.
I don't know, but... I'll try.

1741
01:27:15,229 --> 01:27:17,665
Nothing beats a failure but a try.

1742
01:27:17,765 --> 01:27:20,601
- Now we're making some progress.
- Yeah.

1743
01:27:20,701 --> 01:27:22,439
A try's a try, right?

1744
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:28,042
Oh, boy. That's Tanner.
That's trouble.

1745
01:27:28,142 --> 01:27:30,244
He's still got it.
I knew you got it in you.

1746
01:27:30,344 --> 01:27:31,787
- Now, don't.
- Baby...

1747
01:27:32,813 --> 01:27:36,651
You get off my property, Tanner McCoy,
before I knock you on your ass again.

1748
01:27:36,751 --> 01:27:39,253
- Give him a chance.
- He's just coming here to start trouble.

1749
01:27:39,353 --> 01:27:43,162
- No, he's not.
- I want to apologize.

1750
01:27:43,891 --> 01:27:46,460
- What?
- I want to...

1751
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,469
say thank you.

1752
01:27:49,463 --> 01:27:51,873
- I'm sorry. I didn't get your name.
- Eileen.

1753
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,502
Miss Eileen.

1754
01:27:54,602 --> 01:27:58,706
He told me what you did
for him. So... thank you.

1755
01:27:58,806 --> 01:28:01,284
Oh, thank you!

1756
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:05,413
He really is a good man.

1757
01:28:05,513 --> 01:28:07,481
He's just been so troubled...

1758
01:28:07,581 --> 01:28:09,820
with all that's been
going on with the dam.

1759
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:14,799
Thank you.

1760
01:28:20,327 --> 01:28:22,563
Tanner, I've been working
on a new strain of corn...

1761
01:28:22,663 --> 01:28:24,465
that doesn't need as much water.

1762
01:28:24,565 --> 01:28:27,077
I could use your help with it.

1763
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:31,775
Yeah. I'd be glad to.

1764
01:28:38,512 --> 01:28:40,881
I'm sorry I wanted to get you fired.

1765
01:28:40,981 --> 01:28:43,718
I'm gonna talk to the
mayor tomorrow. Promise.

1766
01:28:43,818 --> 01:28:45,786
I'm sure he's still very upset.

1767
01:28:45,886 --> 01:28:49,624
Having to choose between going
on with Jubilee or getting sued...

1768
01:28:49,724 --> 01:28:51,459
is pretty crazy.

1769
01:28:51,559 --> 01:28:54,462
The town's going on with it,
but we're not happy...

1770
01:28:54,562 --> 01:28:58,466
about not being able to say
Jesus or celebrate his birth.

1771
01:28:58,566 --> 01:29:00,468
You know, Bailey's been practicing...

1772
01:29:00,568 --> 01:29:03,148
and all the kids are really sad.

1773
01:29:04,138 --> 01:29:07,515
Yeah, I've been thinking about that,
and I have an idea.

1774
01:29:08,776 --> 01:29:11,278
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells

1775
01:29:11,378 --> 01:29:13,347
Jingle all the way

1776
01:29:13,447 --> 01:29:16,084
- We are live...
- Look at all the news vans.

1777
01:29:17,752 --> 01:29:20,521
This old town has never
had this much attention.

1778
01:29:20,621 --> 01:29:23,290
Well, since the whorehouse
closed down in 1970.

1779
01:29:23,390 --> 01:29:26,460
- That was a sad day.
- What do you think about the celebration?

1780
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:29,630
Well, I say Christmas is about Jesus.

1781
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:33,334
I ran down here. I ran for my life!

1782
01:29:33,434 --> 01:29:35,469
'Cause I was gonna start a fire.

1783
01:29:35,569 --> 01:29:37,371
"O Lord Jesus is a fire."

1784
01:29:37,471 --> 01:29:39,106
Ain't nobody got time for that.

1785
01:29:39,206 --> 01:29:41,442
- Hell no.
- Hold on there.

1786
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:44,211
- We need to shut this down.
- Just wait a sec.

1787
01:29:44,311 --> 01:29:46,013
See what she's got to say.

1788
01:29:46,113 --> 01:29:48,449
I told them to hide the kids,
hide they wife...

1789
01:29:48,549 --> 01:29:51,352
and hide they Santa Claus,
'cause it's crazy around here.

1790
01:29:51,452 --> 01:29:53,421
Thank you so much. This is lovely.

1791
01:29:53,521 --> 01:29:56,157
I got a candy apple.
Where y'all went?

1792
01:29:56,257 --> 01:29:58,997
Merry Christmas. How you doing?
Where y'all went?

1793
01:30:00,261 --> 01:30:02,797
There they is, over there.
Hey, Oliver, how ya doin'?

1794
01:30:02,897 --> 01:30:05,534
Good to see you. Good to
see you. All right, all right.

1795
01:30:06,634 --> 01:30:10,477
Listen, listen, we have a contract.
You see those people over there?

1796
01:30:11,138 --> 01:30:12,979
They are very powerful.

1797
01:30:13,741 --> 01:30:16,210
You have to take down the nativity.

1798
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:17,889
Okay, that's it.

1799
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:20,915
May I have everyone's attention?

1800
01:30:21,015 --> 01:30:22,316
What is she doing?

1801
01:30:22,416 --> 01:30:24,051
Hello, Bucktussle.

1802
01:30:24,151 --> 01:30:26,854
I want to thank you all for coming
out to the Christmas Jubilee.

1803
01:30:26,954 --> 01:30:29,990
- Look at your daughter.
- Isn't she beautiful?

1804
01:30:30,090 --> 01:30:32,059
I'd also like to thank Sheldon
Construction Company...

1805
01:30:32,159 --> 01:30:34,671
for sponsoring this
Christmas celebration.

1806
01:30:38,032 --> 01:30:41,769
Christmas is about giving back,
and with all the world watching...

1807
01:30:41,869 --> 01:30:45,873
not only did Sheldon Construction
Company fund this event...

1808
01:30:45,973 --> 01:30:47,942
but they've also agreed to release...

1809
01:30:48,042 --> 01:30:52,648
150,000 gallons of water a day
down the river to the farmers.

1810
01:30:54,148 --> 01:30:55,556
Thank you.

1811
01:31:00,988 --> 01:31:03,568
- What are you doing?
- Giving goodwill towards men.

1812
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:06,594
- Thank you, Mr. Sheldon.
- She's smart.

1813
01:31:06,694 --> 01:31:09,597
- I told you.
- Aren't you glad you didn't do anything?

1814
01:31:09,697 --> 01:31:11,098
- You care about getting back...
- Yeah.

1815
01:31:11,198 --> 01:31:13,367
To the heart of who we are as people.

1816
01:31:13,467 --> 01:31:17,037
You are so proud to
be a part of a town...

1817
01:31:17,137 --> 01:31:19,340
that doesn't mind keeping
the Christ in Christmas...

1818
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:22,109
so much so, that they are
presenting the McCoy School...

1819
01:31:22,209 --> 01:31:26,724
with $100,000 a year
for the next four years.

1820
01:31:34,855 --> 01:31:37,091
- Yeah! Yes!
- Yes, yes!

1821
01:31:37,191 --> 01:31:40,728
Such a fantastic Christmas
gift to the city, sir.

1822
01:31:40,828 --> 01:31:43,731
- Can you give us a comment?
- So without further ado...

1823
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:45,933
let the Christmas Jubilee begin.

1824
01:31:46,033 --> 01:31:47,612
Come on.

1825
01:31:50,905 --> 01:31:54,976
Well, hello, Bucktussle,
and welcome...

1826
01:31:55,743 --> 01:31:58,449
welcome to the Christmas
Jubilee and Fair.

1827
01:31:59,246 --> 01:32:01,148
The children of McCoy School...

1828
01:32:01,248 --> 01:32:04,018
have put together a little
presentation for us all...

1829
01:32:04,118 --> 01:32:06,921
and this has all been under the
direction of their current teacher...

1830
01:32:07,021 --> 01:32:08,989
May be wrong for that.

1831
01:32:09,089 --> 01:32:11,058
I am so proud of the kids.

1832
01:32:11,158 --> 01:32:12,593
Mrs. Lacey Williams.

1833
01:32:12,693 --> 01:32:15,663
- Did she say, "Mrs. Lacey Williams"?
- It was all her idea.

1834
01:32:15,763 --> 01:32:19,333
- Yep, she did.
- So, thank you, Lacey, for everything.

1835
01:32:19,433 --> 01:32:25,146
And now the children of McCoy School,
featuring Bailey McCoy.

1836
01:32:26,874 --> 01:32:28,753
That's my boy!

1837
01:32:31,378 --> 01:32:35,716
<i>Mary, did you know</i>

1838
01:32:35,816 --> 01:32:39,320
<i>That your baby boy</i>

1839
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:43,791
<i>Would give sight to the blind man?</i>

1840
01:32:43,891 --> 01:32:48,162
<i>Mary, did you know</i>

1841
01:32:48,262 --> 01:32:50,998
- <i>That your baby boy</i>
- Hey, baby.

1842
01:32:51,098 --> 01:32:52,566
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1843
01:32:52,666 --> 01:32:57,238
<i>Would calm a storm with his hand?</i>

1844
01:32:57,338 --> 01:33:00,241
<i>Did you know</i>

1845
01:33:00,341 --> 01:33:03,878
<i>That your baby boy</i>

1846
01:33:03,978 --> 01:33:09,350
<i>Has walked where angels trod</i>

1847
01:33:09,450 --> 01:33:15,489
<i>And when you kiss your little baby</i>

1848
01:33:15,589 --> 01:33:21,262
<i>You have kissed the face of God?</i>

1849
01:33:21,362 --> 01:33:25,569
<i>Mary, did you</i>

1850
01:33:26,233 --> 01:33:30,804
<i>Know?</i>

1851
01:33:57,331 --> 01:33:59,400
You don't need to
have no lingerie on.

1852
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:03,437
Eileen, tell him we've been shopping
at Tifton's for over 15 years.

1853
01:34:03,537 --> 01:34:05,706
Yes, okay. I'm gonna help her.

1854
01:34:05,806 --> 01:34:07,541
Okay, go help her. Fifteen years.

1855
01:34:07,641 --> 01:34:10,177
Well, 15 years ago maybe
that lingerie worked.

1856
01:34:10,277 --> 01:34:12,112
But now the lingerie
don't work, honey.

1857
01:34:12,212 --> 01:34:13,681
You are so insulting!

1858
01:34:13,781 --> 01:34:15,749
I am not insulting.
I am telling you the truth.

1859
01:34:15,849 --> 01:34:17,484
You shouldn't have
on no damn lingerie.

1860
01:34:17,584 --> 01:34:19,286
I'm trying to save you
some embarrassment.

1861
01:34:19,386 --> 01:34:22,122
Put on that damn lingerie, look like
you got hair damage on your ass.

1862
01:34:22,222 --> 01:34:26,327
I mean, come on now. Come on, honey.
I'm trying to help y'all.

1863
01:34:26,427 --> 01:34:28,929
- Is this good?
- There you go trying to control everything.

1864
01:34:29,029 --> 01:34:31,231
- I am not trying to...
- Let me get the lines clean.

1865
01:34:31,331 --> 01:34:32,800
Let me get the eye lines clean...

1866
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:35,135
'cause I got a single on
me and a single on you.

1867
01:34:35,235 --> 01:34:37,204
And Maysie's sitting in the
editing room right now cussing...

1868
01:34:37,304 --> 01:34:38,939
'cause we're talking
all over each other.

1869
01:34:39,039 --> 01:34:41,542
Lacey, you do not
have a Christmas tree!

1870
01:34:41,642 --> 01:34:43,610
- Mama.
- What? No, really!

1871
01:34:43,710 --> 01:34:45,179
That's why you wanted me here...

1872
01:34:45,279 --> 01:34:47,815
- Yup, that's exactly why.
- I'll clean up and straighten out.

1873
01:34:47,915 --> 01:34:50,351
I'm gonna take this room.
Let me go straighten up a little.

1874
01:34:50,451 --> 01:34:52,353
- Then we'll go...
- She talks so much.

1875
01:34:52,453 --> 01:34:55,022
- Is this one yours, Madea?
- All right, come on.

1876
01:34:55,122 --> 01:34:57,202
What you talking about?
You just talking all over everybody.

1877
01:35:01,228 --> 01:35:03,831
- Hi.
- Look, they do it in unison.

1878
01:35:03,931 --> 01:35:06,800
They all do it in unison.
That's nice. Unison is nice.

1879
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:09,269
The unison is very nice.

1880
01:35:09,369 --> 01:35:11,405
You tryin' to correct me?
I say it's "u-nis-on."

1881
01:35:11,505 --> 01:35:13,007
No, Aunt Madea.

1882
01:35:13,107 --> 01:35:14,842
So I have a meeting down the hall...

1883
01:35:14,942 --> 01:35:17,511
Any unison when they sang unison.

1884
01:35:17,611 --> 01:35:21,181
No, ma'am, it's not.
But that's fine. That's okay.

1885
01:35:21,281 --> 01:35:22,916
I have a meeting down the hall...

1886
01:35:23,016 --> 01:35:25,152
I thought it was "unison",
and "a cappollo."

1887
01:35:25,252 --> 01:35:27,721
When they sang in no music,
what is that?

1888
01:35:27,821 --> 01:35:28,956
No music?

1889
01:35:29,056 --> 01:35:31,358
Yeah, when you sang and there ain't
no music, ain't that a "cappollo"?

1890
01:35:31,458 --> 01:35:33,193
No, that's a cappella.

1891
01:35:33,293 --> 01:35:35,195
I don't know much about music.

1892
01:35:35,295 --> 01:35:37,807
Me and Ike Turner didn't make it.
He went on with Tina.

1893
01:35:38,732 --> 01:35:40,634
That's okay. That's okay.

1894
01:35:40,734 --> 01:35:42,469
I would beat the hell out of him.

1895
01:35:42,569 --> 01:35:44,705
Ike wasn't gonna put his hands
on me. That's all I'm saying.

1896
01:35:44,805 --> 01:35:46,573
I'm sorry. Say what you're
saying to the children.

1897
01:35:46,673 --> 01:35:48,075
- Are you done? Okay.
- Yes!

1898
01:35:48,175 --> 01:35:50,077
I have a meeting down the hall...

1899
01:35:50,177 --> 01:35:52,346
You ain't getting testy with me, are you?
Talkin' about "Are you done?"

1900
01:35:52,446 --> 01:35:54,715
- No, of course not.
- Okay.

1901
01:35:54,815 --> 01:35:58,252
Let's start over from the top, 'cause
that's gonna make it in the gag reel.

1902
01:35:58,352 --> 01:35:59,319
Speed.

1903
01:35:59,419 --> 01:36:00,888
- White lightning?
- Yeah, moonshine.

1904
01:36:00,988 --> 01:36:02,890
You want to take a snort?

1905
01:36:02,990 --> 01:36:04,291
Nope, I'll pass.

1906
01:36:04,391 --> 01:36:07,194
Boy, it'll put some hair on
your chest, I'll guarantee ya.

1907
01:36:07,294 --> 01:36:10,898
Stop it. Come on.
Talk about hair on your chest.

1908
01:36:10,998 --> 01:36:12,900
I could French-braid his.

1909
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,935
That's right. I could
put a little bow on it.

1910
01:36:15,035 --> 01:36:18,072
She's too pretty to have
hair on her chest. Really.

1911
01:36:18,172 --> 01:36:20,174
I gotta tell you, I got rid of mine.

1912
01:36:20,274 --> 01:36:22,242
Little bat hairs
attached to needles...

1913
01:36:22,342 --> 01:36:24,511
soaked in cucumber juice
and a boatload of Nair.

1914
01:36:24,611 --> 01:36:26,613
Gone, like that, if you
ever have a problem with...

1915
01:36:26,713 --> 01:36:29,183
I've seen a mosquito
so daggone big...

1916
01:36:29,283 --> 01:36:31,919
it was dry-humping a wiener
dog right there on the porch.

1917
01:36:32,019 --> 01:36:35,589
She's way prettier than the
last one. She looked like...

1918
01:36:35,689 --> 01:36:37,097
Tyler Perry.

1919
01:36:40,194 --> 01:36:41,995
Boy, I tell you what, Son,
she's way prettier...

1920
01:36:42,095 --> 01:36:43,997
than that last girl you was with.

1921
01:36:44,097 --> 01:36:46,108
Good night. She looked
like old Tyler Perry.

1922
01:36:49,203 --> 01:36:51,105
All right. Keep going.

1923
01:36:51,205 --> 01:36:52,706
Oh, my God.

1924
01:36:52,806 --> 01:36:54,541
Where are my manners?

1925
01:36:54,641 --> 01:36:56,210
I'll do one it one more time. Ready?

1926
01:36:56,310 --> 01:36:57,811
Where are my manners?

1927
01:36:57,911 --> 01:36:59,880
But this'un,
you done good on this'un.

1928
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:02,316
Shut the...

1929
01:37:02,416 --> 01:37:05,586
I need to introduce myself,
but where are my manners?

1930
01:37:05,686 --> 01:37:07,288
I am...

1931
01:37:09,790 --> 01:37:11,425
- All right.
- It's okay, Mama.

1932
01:37:11,525 --> 01:37:13,901
I know. It's gonna roll at the
end of the movie. All right.

1933
01:37:14,561 --> 01:37:16,697
I'm a truck driver.

1934
01:37:16,797 --> 01:37:20,067
Been out on the road a lot.
Long-haul truck driver.

1935
01:37:20,167 --> 01:37:21,468
You run long hos?

1936
01:37:21,568 --> 01:37:22,836
No, long haul.

1937
01:37:22,936 --> 01:37:24,538
Oh, haw, like haw.

1938
01:37:24,638 --> 01:37:26,106
- Hauling.
- Oh, hauling.

1939
01:37:26,206 --> 01:37:29,409
Like your eucalyptus.
Menthol. "Hall." Haul.

1940
01:37:29,509 --> 01:37:30,811
Not "hole." Haul.

1941
01:37:30,911 --> 01:37:33,280
- A hole, a haul, okay.
- But anyway...

1942
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:35,289
he still lives here, that Tanner.

1943
01:37:36,750 --> 01:37:38,318
Kid's still beating him up?

1944
01:37:38,418 --> 01:37:39,887
Yeah, he's still beating him up.

1945
01:37:39,987 --> 01:37:42,055
The little kid?
He's too big for that.

1946
01:37:42,155 --> 01:37:44,424
No, he's big now.
He's a regular-sized kid.

1947
01:37:44,524 --> 01:37:47,094
I mean, he growed with...
He growed with Conner.

1948
01:37:47,194 --> 01:37:50,230
Tanner, he's regular size.
He ain't like a dwarf or nothin'.

1949
01:37:50,330 --> 01:37:52,366
- He growed?
- Yeah, he growed up that tall.

1950
01:37:52,466 --> 01:37:55,135
He ain't a dwarf. I mean,
shoot, he'd take a dwarf.

1951
01:37:55,235 --> 01:37:56,870
He'd kick ass out of a dwarf.

1952
01:37:56,970 --> 01:37:58,438
Hell, I hope so.

1953
01:37:58,538 --> 01:38:01,074
It's just regular-sized
kids he got trouble with.

1954
01:38:01,174 --> 01:38:04,211
- Okay. Okay.
- But he's good in the dwarf department.

1955
01:38:04,311 --> 01:38:06,980
I need a dictionary to keep
up with you sometime, honey.

1956
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:10,817
If you're gonna do it, then you
need to do it and keep doin' her...

1957
01:38:10,917 --> 01:38:14,054
and then when you're done doin' her,
you keep doin' her again...

1958
01:38:14,154 --> 01:38:16,523
'cause you wanna keep doin'
what it is you need to do...

1959
01:38:16,623 --> 01:38:18,964
in order to do what
you need to be doin'.

1960
01:38:19,893 --> 01:38:21,165
Ain't that right?

1961
01:38:22,062 --> 01:38:23,697
She told you that lie too?

1962
01:38:23,797 --> 01:38:26,166
She didn't have no damn heart attack.

1963
01:38:26,266 --> 01:38:29,536
She had gas. We got her to the hospital,
they said she had gas.

1964
01:38:29,636 --> 01:38:30,604
What?

1965
01:38:30,704 --> 01:38:34,149
They ran one of them pipes in there,
she farted, it was over.

1966
01:38:39,846 --> 01:38:41,782
Yeah, she had gas.

1967
01:38:41,882 --> 01:38:44,384
She had gas. She had gas.

1968
01:38:44,484 --> 01:38:47,454
They hit her in the stomach real
hard and she farted. It was over.

1969
01:38:47,554 --> 01:38:49,056
Then she had heartburn.

1970
01:38:49,156 --> 01:38:52,066
Sounds like she needs
some Prilosec OTC.

1971
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:54,828
Get out my way!

1972
01:38:54,928 --> 01:38:57,231
I don't need to be here
in this stuck-up-ass...

1973
01:38:57,331 --> 01:38:58,799
bougie-ass store nowhere.

1974
01:38:58,899 --> 01:39:01,809
I don't need to be up in
there with y'all! Go to hell!

1975
01:39:05,405 --> 01:39:08,213
Where's my damn car?
Where's my damn car?

1976
01:39:09,676 --> 01:39:11,187
Shut the hell up.

1977
01:39:18,085 --> 01:39:19,220
Cut.
