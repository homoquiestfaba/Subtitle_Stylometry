1
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,308
<i>That's the first performance 
I saw when I came to New York.</i>

2
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,715
<i>It is, two years ago, 
in the fall festival.</i>

3
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,593
<i>Oh my god, I remember your solo.
You were amazing.</i>

4
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,755
<i>Thanks.</i>

5
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,999
<i>- Is it only the three of us?
- I think there's supposed to 
be another dancer.</i>

6
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,192
- Hi! 
- Hi.

7
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,196
- I'm Katie.
- I'm Théo.

8
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,829
Cynthia.

9
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,789
And you are?

10
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,829
Chip.

11
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,431
<i>We're on the opening night 
of the festival.</i>

12
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,591
Which is a big deal.

13
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,113
It's about ten minutes.

14
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,278
It'll... it's going to be the first 
piece of the program.

15
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,798
You'll all be dancing it.
I'm going to be dancing in it too.

16
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,515
Umm, first off, I'm going to need 
you all here everyday,

17
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,151
Fill the spaces later as we need,
so we'll be working some evenings,

18
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,318
but we'll figure out the schedule 
as we go along.

19
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,028
Any questions?

20
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,959
Right, let's get started.

21
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,274
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

22
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,596
<i>I said I have to move out 
at the end of the month.</i>

23
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,233
<i>What am I gonna do?</i>

24
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,878
Can't you just go stay with Grampa?

25
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,393
<i>No, I can't!</i>

26
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,112
<i>You have to come home.</i>

27
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,391
<i>You have to come home 
and help me, Chip.</i>

28
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,311
- I can't, I have a job here.

29
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,433
<i>-I have nowhere to go.</i>

30
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,789
No, I know.

31
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,958
<i> -I'm losing my house, baby, 
all our things...</i>

32
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,115
I know.

33
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,311
<i> - I don't know what to do.</i>

34
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,510
<i>You have to come back here.</i>

35
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,675
- I can't.

36
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,149
<i>I'll just throw all your things
 on the street if you don't come home.</i>

37
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,588
I can't.

38
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,639
<i>- They'll all go in the garbage.</i>

39
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,268
<i>I'm serious, Chip.</i>

40
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,310
- I know.

41
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,395
<i>Into the trash.</i>

42
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,435
- Fine.

43
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,195
<i>I have to go.</i>

44
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,549
- Bye.

45
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,198
<i>...the seconds... 
the hand solo now... </i>

46
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,919
<i>Foots are here...</i>

47
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,476
Then it gets to there and this 
corner the hand just trails out...

48
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,833
Let's try and synch this off.
Let's do two armswings...

49
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,989
one, two...

50
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,318
<i>And can I have Theo for a second?</i>

51
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,156
<i>- Could you just come into the space?
- Yes, boss.</i>

52
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,918
<i>- Can you just... pass, 
just pass on... arm thing.</i>

53
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,789
<i>You've got a nice figure, 
range of motion here.</i>

54
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,309
<i>Yeah... I got it.</i>

55
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,992
<i>And I used to take a plate, 
I put the ragout sauce on it.</i>

56
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,433
<i>I would microwave it...</i>

57
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,039
<i>- Omg, you made it?</i>

58
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,276
<i>-My husband. No big deals.</i>

59
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,873
- Good Morning.
- Hi.

60
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,993
Chip, do you want some frittata?

61
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,753
It's really good!

62
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,548
What's a frittata?

63
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,071
It's like an omelette.

64
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,070
- Is there meat in it?
- Eggs and dairy.

65
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,749
<i>Well?</i>

66
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,672
<i>- Tastes good. Thanks.</i>

67
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,357
- How old are you?
- 18.

68
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,869
Do you have parents?

69
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,509
Of course.

70
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,313
Where do they live?

71
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,633
My mother lives in Kansas and
 my father's in Indiana.

72
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,753
<i>When did you come to New York?</i>

73
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,189
In the summer,

74
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,118
for the Joffrey programme.

75
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,392
- They gave me a scholarship.
- And that's where Anthony saw you dance?

76
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,233
Your parents must be so proud of you.

77
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,319
I should get dressed.

78
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,389
So it's not so much about stepping 
forward for an arabesque...

79
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,678
as much as it's about...

80
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,593
You know, so that's the head is 
headed somewhere.

81
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,114
For our dance history lectures,

82
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,357
someone likes Merce Cunningham or 
Eric Hawkins who had that idea that...

83
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,318
If you actually just go over to the corner...

84
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,199
And just face, face the back door.

85
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,150
Chip!

86
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,390
Thank you.

87
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,229
So, it's just that, going, 
rather than "Chip!" "-Yes?".

88
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,395
You know, so you just have, here, here,
and in yeh, so it's not, er...

89
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,431
- Ok, breathe in.

90
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,835
Nice and deep, and out. 

91
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,996
Is it, um, beach? 

92
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,432
Is it all icecaps?

93
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,593
It's like, it's like South Pole, right?

94
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,998
Not that far under!

95
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,918
It's like the ocean down there.

96
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,273
Are you hungry?

97
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,033
Starving!

98
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,469
Chip!

99
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,678
What's your middle name?

100
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,108
Daniel.

101
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,033
Chip Daniel.

102
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,390
It's time to go home, Chip Daniel.

103
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,233
Get some rest, yeh?

104
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,353
Goodnight, Chip.

105
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,031
<i>ONE</i>

106
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,590
Chip?

107
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,030
- Tea.
- Thanks.

108
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,438
Careful, it's hot.

109
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,556
It's herbal tea. It's good for you.

110
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,434
I like coffee.

111
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,318
I used to like coffee too.

112
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,759
Not anymore?

113
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,916
My ex-boyfriend was a barista.

114
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,072
You spent the night here?

115
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,231
Just last night?

116
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,392
Are you going to tell Anthony?

117
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,948
You should put this away. 
Everyone's gonna be here soon.

118
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,318
I'm not shy. 

119
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,910
Did you go to military school?

120
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,638
Just for two years.

121
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,273
How come?

122
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,511
My mom sent me to live with my dad,
but he didn't want me.

124
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,278
I bet you haven't had breakfast.

125
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,471
I have a yogurt and an apple.

126
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,309
Look...

127
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,392
I have this man in my mouth.

128
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,190
- What?

129
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,269
<i>Thank you Katie, 
that you been so nice to me.<i>

130
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,990
<i>You are very nice person.<i>

131
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,832
I like something to eat,
if you don't mind.

132
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,998
That's so weird!

133
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,154
How do you do that?

134
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,636
- <i>Do what?<i>
- Ok, stop it.

135
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,513
<i>Please! Get me outta here! Please!<i> 

136
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,076
<i>He's gonna swallow me! Help!<i>

137
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,394
Too late.

138
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,437
- Chip.
- Yeh?

139
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,593
- Theo.
- Yes, boss?

140
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,511
Let's see the recital, the solo.

141
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,677
Chip? You try it now.

142
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,859
<i>Nobody wants to join 
for a movie?</i>

143
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,269
No thanks.

144
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,230
Katie?

145
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,318
- Another night. I'm going home 
and have a bath.

146
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,636
Walk me to the subway, 
on Broadway? 

147
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,596
Ok.

148
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,512
- Have fun!
- Goodnight.

149
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,592
- Enjoy your bath.
- I will.

150
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,318
You don't have to stay.

151
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,750
How many nights have you been
 sleeping here?

152
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,112
Since last week.

153
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,438
- I got kicked out of my apartment.
- What happened?

154
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,988
It wasn't really my apartment.
It was this guy's...

155
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,551
I didn't know where else to stay.

156
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,193
I have a sofa, it's pretty comfortable.

158
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,752
Just for a few nights, only 'til 
you can figure something else out.

159
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,474
My boyfriend and I broke up 
a few months ago.

160
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,839
Seven years.

161
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,636
It's longer than my parents 
were together.

162
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,997
- Do you have a cat?
- No.

163
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,509
- I'm allergic.
- I don't have a cat.

164
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,951
<i>I can make you dinner.<i>

165
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,633
You can cook?

166
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,956
<i>I can make spaghetti.<i>

167
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,192
Some other night, ok?

168
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,350
You ready?

169
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,515
<i>Ready!<i>

170
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,633
Talk normally.

171
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,069
- Sorry.

172
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,392
And don't forget your sleeping bag.
I don't want to have to wash extra sheets.

173
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,871
I don't want the others to know.

174
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,559
It's just for a few nights.

175
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,673
I don't have a lot of room.

176
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,276
I don't take up a lot of room.

176
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,276
<i>Hello?<i>

177
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,393
<i>What do you want?</i>

178
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,077
<i>Do you know what time it is here?</i>

179
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,629
<i>You just stop calling me all the time.</i>

180
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,156
<i>I can't talk to you when you're 
like this.</i>

181
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,753
<i>Oh, you're drunk.</i>

182
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,633
<i>No, you're drunk!</i>

183
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,799
<i>Yes, you are!</i>

184
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,999
<i>I'm hanging up.</i>

185
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,271
<i>TWO</i>

186
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,031
Shit! I brought the wrong sweatpants.

187
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,871
These aren't even washed.

188
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,158
Um, do you mind if I have some 
of your coffee?

189
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,990
- You don't have a cold or anything?
- Completely healthy.

190
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,149
- Thanks.

191
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,240
I was so afraid I was going to be late 
I didn't stop to pick one up.

192
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,194
Where do you live?

193
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,553
Battery Park.

194
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,272
I hate it, but, I'm married.  

195
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,158
- How nice.
- Thanks.

196
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,830
<i>So we'll go from the start...</i>

197
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,233
<i>and on your own time.</i>

198
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,594
<i>I'm, I'm having trouble...</i>

199
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,838
because you, you've asked me 
to turn this way...

201
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,036
and I'm supposed to do all 
these arms together...

202
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,598
But by the time I'm getting here, 
everyone's leaving.

203
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,155
So this is just from when you're 
in this corner here.

204
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,792
That it's, as long as I, get from here 

205
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,313
to this left foot.

206
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,194
- And then you'll back up
and I'll come into this channel

207
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,793
and I'll replace you.
- Yeh, yeh... 

208
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,080
My husband finally took the tree 
down last night.

209
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,112
It almost turned to compost!

210
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,151
He wanted to throw these away.

211
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,309
Darn!

212
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,752
Ok, wait: let's just do the chorus.

213
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,188
Oh, my goodness!

214
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,428
Good morning.

215
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,515
Morning.

216
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,672
I had a weird dream last night.

217
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,718
As I at the Oscars and 
Chris Maloney was sitting there.

218
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,115
- Who?
- The guy from "Law & Order".

219
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,756
I was sitting across the aisle
 from him, and he started to choke,

220
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,436
and suddenly he was on the ground,
 and I was giving him CPR, 

221
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,513
and the police were there, 

222
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,393
and everybody watched 
while I saved his life.

223
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,909
Nice. You were a hero.  

224
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,955
I guess.

225
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,629
- Did you have a nice dream last night?
- I don't dream.

226
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,671
- Everybody dreams.
- I know.

227
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,789
- You probably just don't 
remember them.

228
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,828
<i>Duet.</i>

229
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,714
Katie, if you just come over to 
this side and face her.

230
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,711
Gentlemen, you may want to 
learn this too.

231
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,353
- Which rows?
- Both of them.

232
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,711
Maybe a hair for the back.

233
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,669
So you're going to step 
forward on your left

234
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,031
and move your head around and 
launch, wrap in and tuck in and go.

235
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,830
Good.

236
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,148
You're here.

237
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,669
And... it opens, 

238
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,149
- Sorry.

239
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,877
You come around, and you can
there's something about you being there,

240
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,750
like also pre-empting his step.

241
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,438
- Let me try one more time.

242
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,198
Yeah, that works better, thanks.

243
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,798
- I'm sorry.
- That's ok.

244
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,992
That was hard, huh?

245
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,435
You wanna stay later and 
work on it together?

246
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,279
You wanna try that again?

247
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,113
From here?

248
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,119
What are you doing?

249
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,193
Come on, you like it.

250
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,838
No, I don't.

251
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,911
- You like me though, right?
- No!

252
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,673
I don't know.

253
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,156
- Just let me kiss you.
- Stop it!

254
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,838
I really wanna to kiss you.

255
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,159
Why are you doing this?

256
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,314
Sorry.

257
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,038
I was just fooling around.

258
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,589
Can we get back to work?

259
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,034
I have to go.

260
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,468
I'm sorry.

261
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,149
<i>Chip!</i>

262
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,858
<i>THREE</i>

263
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,230
And... lets go back to the counterbalance.

264
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,029
Madam...

265
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,997
And breakaway...

266
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,271
That's all there,

267
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,949
and then this arm...
is going to take my weight.

268
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,149
- Katie?
- Yes.

269
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,038
You turned out, your arms are 
trailing back through your back space

270
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,736
Your arms are going up as well, 
Eve, and the head.

271
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,678
So ideally, these two shapes 
happen at the same time.

272
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,238
Come up, and get the 
support from Cynthia.

273
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,190
So ideally, this hand is together 

274
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,476
this hand together
and then THIS hand is together

275
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,232
Cynthia, let me try with you.

276
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,949
And... we're in.

277
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,153
Up...  over...

278
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,748
- I'm sorry. You alright?
- Anthony?

279
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,835
Yeh, I'm fine.

280
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,359
My achilles, a bit scary. 

281
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,392
Chip, let's have a try with Katie.

282
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,474
Er, what about me?

283
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,909
- What about you?

284
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,676
Anthony, I think Cynthia and I 
can make this work.

285
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,990
Yeh, maybe you can work 
on it with me later.

286
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,913
- Ok.
- Thank you.

287
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,473
Back to being.

288
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,872
<i>I'm gonna call right now and 
make a reservation on the bus.</i>

289
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,713
- No you can't come here.

290
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,195
<i>What else can I do?
I'm all alone.</i>

291
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,469
- I'll come home.

292
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,551
<i>Do you promise me? 
Because if you don't...</i>

293
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,751
Yes, I'll call Greyhound.

294
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,195
<i>- You call right now!</i>

295
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,189
<i>I mean it!</i>

296
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,150
- Fine.

297
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,317
<i>Whatever you're doing there in 
New York, you stop and come home!</i>

298
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,309
<i>I know what you're doing, 
and I don't like it Chip.</i>

299
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,675
<i>Your Dad wouldn't like what 
you're doing, either.</i>

300
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,794
<i>Now call Greyhound.</i>

301
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,913
- OK, bye.

301
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,213
- Chip!

301
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,213
Hey.

302
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,988
They're really good.

303
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,318
They're vegan.

304
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,719
They are not.

305
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,031
Thanks.  They're good.

306
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,988
Oh, my God!

307
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,959
Would you get dressed?

308
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,239
Thanks, it's cold.

309
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,750
Mmm, a glass of red wine 
would be so perfect now.

310
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,958
I don't drink anymore.

311
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,589
Right.  I'm sorry.

312
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,879
I forgot.

313
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,871
When I came in to 
audition for you, 

314
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,753
I never thought...

315
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,917
I'm not a teacher anymore.

316
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,477
And you're not my student.

317
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,470
That was one night a long time ago.

318
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,797
It's only six years.

319
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,036
I have a husband now.

320
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,839
I hired you

321
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,310
because you're a really...
 talented dancer.

322
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,557
This shouldn't have happened. Ok?

323
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:49,879
<i>Hello? Oh, hey mom!</i>

324
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,789
<i>No, Cynthia just got home 
from rehearsal.</i>

325
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,594
<i>We're about to do something 
for dinner.</i>

326
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,273
<i>Thanks, for calling Greyhound.</i>

327
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,153
<i>for buses to Louisiana press 1.</i>

328
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,278
<i>Kentucky press 2.</i>

329
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,992
<i>Kansas press 3.</i>

330
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,033
<i>For buses going to Wichita press 1.</i>

331
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,119
<i>Topeka press 2.</i>

332
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,958
- Sorry, ok?
- Cynthia!

333
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,434
Where's the focus?

334
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,791
I'm sleeping with Anthony.

335
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,358
Slept with, once.

336
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,429
- Twice! In total.

337
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,592
Huh, God... I'm being such a jerk.

338
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,999
I'm sorry.

339
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,628
Come on.

340
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,274
Yes?!

341
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:52,790
<i>FOUR</i>

342
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,954
And there was this turn... 
I don't know what this turn is.

343
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,794
It's like...

344
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,229
- Like that.

345
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,669
I think...

346
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,193
more...

347
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,593
Let me see!

348
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,313
- Better!
- Feels the same to me.

349
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:46,835
Theo?

350
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,393
I think...

351
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:57,636
I think if Chip ends up more like this,
 he can step more easily into this.

352
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,236
- Into the role.
- Like this.

353
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,711
- Chip, can I see that?
- Sure.

354
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,712
Good, good! Right, let's go on, 
we'll go back.

355
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,513
So and up, and out, and down...

356
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:50,955
Thanks!

357
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,471
- Goodnight everybody!
- See you in the morning.

358
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,518
- Goodnight.
- Again.

359
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,109
Sorry.

360
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,395
Don't worry about it so much.  
This is Chip's solo. 

361
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,273
Katie, are you coming?

362
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,471
- Goodnight, guys. 
- Goodnight.

363
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,237
Hey! I can help you with it,
 if you want.

364
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,431
That's ok, I'm not going to get
 to dance it anyway.

365
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,799
That was fun.

366
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:41,954
I have to pee.

367
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,069
Theo?

368
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,276
I've never done this before.

369
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,031
- I'm all sweaty.
- I don't care...

370
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,194
Was it ok?

371
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,394
Was what ok?

372
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,512
Don't be a jerk.

373
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,473
What do you think?

374
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,274
You first.

375
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,673
It was great.

376
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,639
You have an accent.

377
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,638
You just noticed?

378
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,796
No, I mean, England, right?

379
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:48,788
Australia.

380
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:52,677
- So you're Australian?
- And you're a vegetarian.

381
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,078
We should go.

382
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,589
It's late.

383
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,233
You go ahead.

384
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,109
You sure?

384
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:15,109
Yeh.

385
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,349
Ok.

386
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,793
See you tomorrow?

387
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:30,914
Yeh, tomorrow.

388
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,834
<i>Five</i>

389
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,469
Chip, stop worrying about 
what you look like

389
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:13,469
and start thinking about what 
you're doing with your partner.

390
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,232
This section is not just the prequel to your solo,

391
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:20,893
it's a section in itself and it would be 
nice if you gave it a bit of attention.

392
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,109
Alright?

393
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:24,512
Can we take it again?

393
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:34,512
Chip!

394
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:43,919
Relax your neck!

395
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,718
That was better.

396
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,118
I wish you like coffee.

397
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,154
I wish I did too.

398
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,352
I think maybe I'm gonna 
be dating Theo.

399
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,193
I like Theo!

400
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,439
Is that ok?

401
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,831
- You don't need my approval.

402
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,511
Can I still stay here?

403
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,316
Why don't we just wait 
and see what happens?

404
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,429
Okay?

405
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,519
Thanks for staying.

406
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:10,509
Sure!

407
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,718
What did you want to 
talk to me about?

408
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:16,938
I'm sorry for being a jerk the 
other night, for leaving...

409
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,710
It wasn't your fault. 
I was an idiot.

410
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,148
No you weren't!

411
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,117
I just got so scared.

412
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,555
Of what?

413
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:29,235
That you wouldn't 
want to be with me.

414
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,550
I think about you all the time.

415
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:46,919
So do you really have plans?

416
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:50,476
It's my roommate's birthday.
 I'm meeting her for dinner.

417
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:53,759
Do you want to come?

417
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,459
No.

418
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,159
Are you sure?

419
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,629
U-huh, I'm fine.

420
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,791
I'm just so happy right now.

421
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,269
Me too.

422
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,552
I'll see you tomorrow, ok?

423
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,197
...on the Arabesque step...

424
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:39,838
.. this could be changing too...

425
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:42,918
Oh, we should do it!
We should do 'Showgirls'

426
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,748
Oh my god, we should do 'Showgirls'!

427
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,989
We can do it just as we want...

428
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:49,719
How high can you go?

429
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,638
We should pu up, like, a circus tent

430
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,273
and put like a bell here...

431
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,956
Anthony, we've made 
some changes.

432
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,119
Theo! Wait up!

433
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:54,716
What are you doing after rehearsal?

434
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,069
Why?

435
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:57,388
- I've planned something.

436
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:58,835
Yeh, ok.

437
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:21,153
- Where did you get those?
- I bought them.

438
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,436
You're not old enough to buy wine.

439
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,358
Katie bought it for me.

440
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,392
You asked her to?

441
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,399
I paid for it, though.

442
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:50,435
Let me.

443
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:57,389
- cheers.
- cheers.

444
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:13,951
I called my mom last night.

445
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:17,956
And I told her about you.

446
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:22,433
What did you tell her?

447
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,239
What do you think?

448
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,274
I don't know.

449
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:29,951
I told her that you're my boyfriend.

450
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,479
I am?

451
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:40,635
Cool.

452
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,157
You've had two boyfriends?

453
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:53,233
Two serious ones.

454
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:57,952
That's a lot.

455
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,397
They weren't at the same time.

456
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,233
What happened to them?

457
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:12,272
Well, they both have 
new boyfriends now.

458
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,718
Are you jealous?

459
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:23,112
No. I just don't understand.

460
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,038
That's for my father.

461
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,156
He's been sick for a while.

462
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,633
What's wrong with him?

463
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:44,912
I don't know exactly.

464
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:48,189
He had to go live with his 
parents in Indiana,

465
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,311
so they could take care of him.

466
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,751
You guys must be close.

467
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,276
I hardly ever saw him.

468
01:14:58,560 --> 01:14:59,913
Do you call him?

469
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,036
He doesn't like to talk 
on the phone.

470
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:07,393
And your mother?

471
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,079
She's at home.

472
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,428
- With who?

473
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,349
Nobody.

474
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:15,998
She's all alone.

475
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:28,711
I'm going to see my mom 
next week.

476
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,558
Would you come with me?

477
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:31,715
- Of course.

478
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:00,870
Good.

479
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,472
I am a better turner than you are.

480
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:09,999
- No you're not!

481
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,074
One.

482
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:18,629
You're up!

483
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:23,509
Good!

484
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,155
Whoa! Nice!

485
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:52,356
Shit!

486
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,939
You gotta keep turning.

487
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:15,592
