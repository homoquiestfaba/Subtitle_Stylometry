00:00:00,000 --> 00:02:50,000
<i>Subtitled by Subscene (Divxstation)</i>

2
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,500
The Mandarin!

3
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,800
Yeah. Looks like we're gonna need
someone else on the temple.

4
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,900
Mr. Rhodey! Mr. Rhodey.

5
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,700
It 's Mr. Rhodes, or just Rhodey.
Not both. Remember?

6
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,900
The rains are nearly upon us,
and you are very far behind schedule.

7
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,400
Not my fault.

8
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,200
If the underground rivers
continue to swell...

9
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,900
the ruins will collapse!
Mr. Tony promised you would...

10
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,200
You wanna blame someone?
Try the Jade Dragons!

11
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,600
Their little "commando" raids
have cost us weeks!

12
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,400
That is a security issue.
And Mr. Tony promised us...

13
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,100
I know! He promised
a lot of things.

14
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,900
What happened?
You were due yesterday.

15
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,500
Inspections in Shanghai.

16
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,800
One more strip search
and my price goes way up!

17
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,900
Mr. Rhodey!

18
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,700
Mr. Ling, it 's gonna be fine, really.

19
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,200
We now have enough liquid steel to
start pumping it under the excavation.

20
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,000
But will it be enough
to raise it safely above the ground?

21
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:17,200
Look, it 's a sound plan, and I'll do
my best. That 's all I can promise.

22
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,000
Our gratitude, Mr. Rhodey.

23
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,100
I got that one.

24
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,800
Ah, Tony!

25
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,100
Chocolates and lady fingers.
My favorite.

26
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Rhodey, I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

27
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,500
We got hit! Again!

28
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,000
How are the ruins?
Any damage?

29
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,400
The ruins? No. And I'm fine, too.
Thanks for asking.

30
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,800
- Hey. I knew you'd be okay.
- You just don't get it, do you?

31
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,100
These lunatics
mean business, Tony.

32
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,600
Better finish dessert without me.
I'm gonna have to take this.

33
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,400
- Okay. So what happened?
- We can't defend ourselves...

34
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,300
...that 's what happened.
- We've been overthis, Rhodey.

35
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,300
Yeah. And I'm guessing that 's why you
bumped the weapons from the cargo.

36
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,800
What are you talking about?
I didn't authorize any weapons.

37
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,400
- You went behind my back?
- What choice did I have?

38
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,000
The closerwe are to raising
the Mandarin's temple...

39
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,600
the closerwe are to getting our butts
blown off by those crazy zealots!

40
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,800
The Jade Dragons
aren't trying to kill anybody...

41
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,600
but if guns get thrown into the mix,
people will die.

42
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
So, you're telling me
you didn't KO the shipment?

43
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,300
No. Would I have? Yes.

44
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,800
Because I knew
they'd most likely be stolen.

45
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,300
Look, one way or another,
I gotta get some support here.

46
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,700
All right, Rhodey, I'll fly over.

47
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,500
You said that last week,
and the week before that.

48
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,700
This time I promise. I'll clear
my schedule. Just hang in there.

49
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,900
Now it 's time for something
that really needs my attention.

50
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,800
Pepper, darling,
you look concerned. Am I late?

51
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,600
Forty minutes.
And they're not happy.

52
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,900
So what else is new?
I say we keep it casual today.

53
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,500
Smudged lipstick might be
a little too casual.

54
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,900
Mr. Chairman. Gentlemen.

55
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,700
Okay, I take it we're not here
to form a company softball team.

56
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Cavalier as always, Mr. Chairman.

57
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,700
This is just one more example
of how little respect...

58
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,700
Tony Stark has for this company
and its shareholders.

59
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,600
Ah, the shareholders. You know,
I bet they'd love a softball team.

60
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,000
That 's right, Tony, laugh it off.
Just like you do everything else.

61
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,800
Well, let 's see how funny
you think this is.

62
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,900
We're correcting
a grave mistake today.

63
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,600
Remind me, which mistake is this?

64
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,900
Handing you your own
Advanced Technologies Division.

65
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,100
It was a colossal error in judgment
giving you that much freedom.

66
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,200
Need I not remind this, I was against
that decision from the very beginning!

67
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,400
- You need not.
- Then let me get to the point.

68
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
You're being charged
with gross malfeasance.

69
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,900
On what grounds?

70
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,200
Let 's try your little excavation
in China...

71
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,500
with a price tag of $ 226 million,
and climbing.

72
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,700
You not only agreed to do this
without board approval...

73
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,800
you're doing it all for free!

74
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,600
You wanna know about China?
Call it a gesture of goodwill.

75
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,000
But their government is so grateful,
that they've just awarded us...

76
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,300
contracts worth twenty times
what we're spending over there.

77
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,100
Here, look them over.
I think you'll be quite impressed.

78
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,400
Now, is there anything else?

79
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,000
How about the half a billion dollars
you've spent so far...

80
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,600
on some secret project?
Again without board approval!

81
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,700
Believe me, what I've been working on
is the future of this company.

82
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,900
A company that my innovations
have built into an empire...

83
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,300
making every person
at this table indecently rich.

84
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,900
Despite the fact that this board
has done nothing, but get in my way.

85
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,600
It is our job to control
loose cannons!

86
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,000
Just as it 's our job
to cut them loose!

87
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,700
- What are you saying?
- Mr. Chairman...

88
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,700
I motion that Tony Stark
be relieved of his duties...

89
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,900
and that his division
be shut down.

90
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,400
- You can't do that!
- I second.

91
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,300
Dad! Say something.

92
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,000
All in favor say: "Aye".

93
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
Aye!

94
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,600
You want my father to drive
this company on his own?

95
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,500
Because he will,
right into the ground!

96
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,100
It was the right decision, Howard.

97
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,300
Relax and enjoy the show, gentlemen.

98
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,100
Today you get to witness a 3,OOO
year old city rise from the dead.

99
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,200
Okay, let 's do this.

100
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,100
Commencing infusion
of Liquid FiberSteel.

101
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,800
- Looking good.
- Five seconds to maximum dispersion.

102
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,300
Three, two, one.

103
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,300
All stop.

104
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,600
Initiate sonic bombardment.

105
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Gentlemen, what's happening here
is that sonic vibrations...

106
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,100
are causing the liquid
steel to expand.

107
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,400
Kind of like cotton candy
orsteelwool.

108
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,400
When we cease the sonic
bombardment, the steel will harden.

109
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,300
See these foundation balloons?

110
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,100
As they begin reaching
full capacity...

111
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,800
they'll push up against
the base of the excavation...

112
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,200
and raise your ancient city
to ground level.

113
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,300
After that, my friends,
it 's there to stay.

114
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,000
Move!

115
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,100
Li Mei!

116
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,900
I have told you,
I will not take innocent lives.

117
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,300
I decide what lives are innocent!

118
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,700
And anyone involved
in the raising of that city is not.

119
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,600
And now, you will take
as many lives as I command...

120
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,900
or I will take yours.

121
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,800
East and West have joined
in preserving...

122
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,500
an important part of our heritage.

123
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,200
Too bad not everybody agrees
that 's a good thing.

124
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,200
You must understand...

125
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,900
the Mandarin's was the darkest,
most violent of all dynasties.

126
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,000
Hundreds of thousands died
under his brutal reign.

127
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,100
But that's ancient history.

128
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:16,300
Some fear that by raising his temple,
it is inviting history to repeat itself.

129
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,500
What do you think?

130
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,800
Many will pay tribute to this place
and prosperity will follow.

131
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,700
To me, that is a good thing.

132
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,600
Go! Run!

133
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,000
Pepper, you minx.

134
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,700
You just couldn't stand it any longer,
could you?

135
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,600
The ruins in China
were attacked again.

136
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,600
Tell Rhodey I'm dealing with
a crisis here. I'll fly out when I can.

137
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,300
Tony, Rhodey's missing.

138
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,100
- What?
- And the workers, they're all dead.

139
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:27,000
- What do you want from me?
- Not you. Tony Stark.

140
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,800
Sir, we have an
obstruction ahead.

141
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,400
I don't care. Just detour around it,
and get me to the dig site.

142
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,000
Yes, Sir. Go right.
We're taking the side street.

143
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,000
This isn't right.
Streets here are never empty.

144
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,300
Back up! Back up!
Move! Move!

145
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,900
Go, go, go!

146
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,300
Tony!

147
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,700
My God! What have you done?
You butchers!

148
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,300
Will he live?

149
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,200
For the moment.

150
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,400
But his heart has suffered
great damage.

151
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Understand me, old man.
If he dies, you die!

152
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,100
Oh man! We gotta do something
to keep him alive.

153
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
You are a man of medicine?

154
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,700
An army medic.
But that was a long time ago.

155
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,100
It 's just gonna have to do.

156
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,300
You dare show concern
for that man?!

157
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,400
He may have doomed us all!

158
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:07,200
I'll never understand why you do not
show such courage on the battlefield.

159
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,500
There is much about me
you will never understand!

160
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,400
I would advise you not to lose sight
of your responsibility, Li Mei!

161
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,800
My responsibility is the only thing
that keeps me here!

162
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,500
Master Chu! Four Elementals
have awakened!

163
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,100
Where are they now?

164
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,700
They've risen into the sky, and set off
upon their quest for the rings!

165
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,000
I hear something.

166
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,300
Howard, listen.
Tony's disappearance, as...

167
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,400
painful as it 's, may be the best thing
for the company.

168
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,700
You know, you lawyers are all alike.
That 's my son you're talking about!

169
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,200
Even so, you need to hear this.

170
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,700
I've been contacted by the Chinese
government. They've got questions.

171
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,000
Like how our weapons ended up
in the hands of known radicals.

172
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,900
They can't blame Tony for that!

173
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,800
Let them blame whoever they want.

174
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,800
Because if they start
looking at you...

175
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,800
the board's gonna throw you
to the wolves.

176
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,500
I don't believe that!
It 's my company!

177
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,400
It 's a public company.

178
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,300
Don't think for a second they won't do
whatever's necessary to protect it.

179
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,200
Tony. Easy, man.
Just relax.

180
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,600
Ho Yin! That 's right. You're gonna
be okay, buddy. Just breathe.

181
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,500
What happened?

182
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,100
You were attacked.
It got pretty bad, man.

183
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,100
What! Rhodey?

184
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,800
Sorry, Tony, but this hardware's
all that 's keeping you alive.

185
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:37,000
- You saved my life?
- No... he did.

186
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,500
Thank you.

187
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,400
How is he?

188
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,200
Ask him yourself.

189
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,800
Tony, meet Li Mei. The only
decent soul in this den of cutthroats.

190
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:10,000
- Pardon me for not getting up.
- I am happy to see you are alive.

191
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,600
That makes two of us.

192
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,000
Thank you.

193
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,000
Li Mei, can you tell me...
why are we prisoners?

194
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,700
I must go.

195
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,700
Well, that 's a first...
you scared off a woman.

196
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,900
Easy to do when you look
like Frankenstein.

197
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,200
How about we find a way
to streamline this a bit?

198
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,200
Your weakness sickens me!

199
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,000
If only I possessed
your strength.

200
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,100
Then you would be my son,
instead of my disgrace!

201
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,200
- I'm sorry, Father.
- Do not call me that!

202
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:21,200
I am angry, Li Mei! I am angry
that when the Mandarin rises...

203
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,800
it is you who will face him, not me!

204
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,900
- It was my right!
- I do not want this life.

205
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:37,300
Your life means nothing! You are
on this earth to serve another purpose!

206
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,400
Either serve with honor,
or next time do not fail!

207
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,700
...amateurvideo shot by tourists
revealing powerful entities...

208
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,500
The Elementals have the first ring.
We are running out of time!

209
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,300
But Tony Stark
has not yet recovered.

210
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,500
He's well enough.
We must begin... now!

211
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,100
- Hey, Tony.
- Rhodey...

212
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,500
we have to figure out
what they plan to do with us.

213
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,900
Whatever it is,
it ain't gonna be good.

214
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,300
In the end...

215
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,500
Wong Chu will kill you.

216
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,100
No doubt.

217
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,400
Why are the Jade Dragons
so up in arms?

218
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,600
What you have accomplished
in months...

219
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,200
they have spent 3,OOO years
trying to prevent.

220
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,400
You mean, raising the city?

221
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,300
But what could they possibly
be afraid of?

222
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,900
- The Mandarin.
- But he's nothing but dust now.

223
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,300
Many do not see death as
the final step in one's existence.

224
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,800
And a prophecy foretells his return.

225
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So, because I lifted the ruins, people
think the prophecy's coming true?

226
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,700
It is as written:

227
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,700
"The city will rise and
the demon Elementals will awaken.

228
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,200
They will gather the bands
of the underworld...

229
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,500
and with them,
resurrect their master."

230
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,100
- That 's just crazy.
- Lf that is what you believe...

231
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,300
there is no point in saying more.

232
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,200
I'm sorry. It 's just hard for me
to swallow.

233
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,300
Tell me, what are these
"bands of the underworld"?

234
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:33,200
Five were fashioned for the Mandarin
as conduits to the afterlife.

235
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,400
Upon his death...

236
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,100
four were stolen by monks, who
sacrificed their lives to hide them.

237
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,100
They were the first
Jade Dragons.

238
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,700
These are the locations
of those bands.

239
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,400
So, once these things are found...

240
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,400
the Mandarin is supposed
to come back to life?

241
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,200
Yes. His demon Elementals
have already begun to gather them.

242
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,600
Stop the Elementals, and you
prevent the Mandarin from rising.

243
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,700
Me? But I...

244
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,800
Stand up!

245
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,900
Do you want to live?

246
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
If I have a choice, yes.

247
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,700
Then, you will reverse what you
have done to the ancient city!

248
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,400
Look, the Fiber Steel that 's holding
it up is pretty much indestructible.

249
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,300
You'll find a way. We'll provide you
with your own technology.

250
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,300
What if I can't do it?

251
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
You owe your life to this man.

252
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,200
See how your unwillingness
repays him.

253
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,900
Please, just stop!

254
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,600
I'll help you.

255
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,400
You have one week, or he dies.

256
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,700
- What are we gonna do now?
- We get to work.

257
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,500
Hi.

258
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,000
Thank you.

259
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,700
What will that device do?

260
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,000
It 's a macrobiotic nullifier.

261
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,500
If it works, it 'll soften the
Fiber Steel under the ruins.

262
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,900
- Will you finish it in time?
- Hope so.

263
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,600
I will let you get back to work.

264
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,300
Li Mei!

265
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,600
You don't belong with
these murderers.

266
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,900
- Why are you doing this?
- The Mandarin will rise...

267
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,900
and many will die in the East
and in the West.

268
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,600
Their souls will be offered
as payment...

269
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,600
Okay, that 's the company line.
Now, what about you?

270
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,500
I have a responsibility.

271
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:15,000
It has been passed from father to son
ever since the Mandarin Dynasty.

272
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,200
- Father to son... but...
- I had no brothers.

273
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,300
And your father?

274
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,500
He...

275
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,400
...is dead.
- I take it he wanted a son.

276
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,300
No.

277
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,500
He needed a son,
but instead he got me.

278
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,300
- You would not understand.
- Maybe I would.

279
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,700
You're not the only one who's faced
a father's disappointment.

280
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,900
Tony, do you know why
you are on this earth?

281
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,400
- Does anyone?
- Yes... I do.

282
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,400
I have always known.

283
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:57,300
- So, this is the life you wanna live?
- My life does not matter.

284
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,800
This thing's amazing!

285
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,500
- Where did you get this idea?
- Just something I came up with.

286
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,900
- Tony!
- What 's going on?

287
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,800
Wong Chu is coming.
You must escape.

288
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,800
Get back.

289
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:08,400
- Demonstrate your device. Now!
- Hey. No problem. Allow me.

290
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,000
Okay, sample is in place.
Let 's see.

291
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,200
Activating thermal
scan constrictors.

292
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,400
Setting atomic nine iron...

293
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,700
to 35O, and... adjusting
for permanent settings.

294
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,800
And...

295
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,300
Your deception will cost you your life!

296
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,400
This way!

297
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,100
Mr. Chu!

298
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,700
Li Mei, it 's okay.
It 's me, Tony.

299
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,100
- Go. Leave.
- Not without you.

300
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,500
Just get out of here. And promise me...
you'll never come back.

301
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,200
- I won't leave you here.
- Goodbye, Tony.

302
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,700
Come on, man! We gotta go!

303
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,700
Climb on.

304
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,000
Stuffy!

305
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,700
That 's the last time
I ever wanna put this thing on.

306
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,500
What should we do with him?

307
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,600
- Why are you asking me?
- You are now the senior member.

308
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,700
I do not care.

309
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,300
- He is the one.
- No, it is not him.

310
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,900
Li Mei, look at it!
It is undeniable!

311
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,600
The prophecy continues
to unfold.

312
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:13,100
He's the Iron Knight! He's destined
to battle the risen Mandarin!

313
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,000
It cannot be him!

314
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,500
What is the matter?
It is a good thing.

315
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,500
The Mandarin can
now be defeated.

316
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,400
We do not know who will be
victorious, only that one will die.

317
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,300
Stark Air 601,you are cleared for
landing. Proceed to runway three.

318
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,400
Hands in the air!

319
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,700
What 's going on here?

320
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,700
I'm SHIELD Agent Drake,
and I'm placing you under arrest.

321
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,300
- For what?
- Arms dealing!

322
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,200
Chinese government is charging you
with selling weapons to radicals...

323
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,200
...the Jade Dragons.
- You guys got this all wrong.

324
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,900
Listen to me, the Jade Dragons
only have Stark weaponry...

325
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,200
because they stole it
from our cargo jet.

326
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,000
We've received documents
linking you to the sale.

327
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,200
What documents?
There was no sale.

328
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,400
Cease-fire! Cease-fire!

329
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,500
He knows it 's bullet proof,
because he built it for us!

330
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,800
What are you doing?
We must hurry!

331
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,000
What of the fifth Elemental?

332
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,000
If we destroy the temple,
the Dragon will fall.

333
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,300
Fine. I will go in first.

334
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,900
It is safe.
Now move, quickly!

335
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,600
Okay, that is far enough.
Set up here.

336
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,200
Forgive me.

337
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,500
Why is this happening to us?

338
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,300
I don't know. But we're cut off
from our offices.

339
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,100
Damn!

340
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,500
Hey.

341
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,900
Those locations are...

342
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,400
Ho Yin drew them on this map!

343
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,000
You think the old man was right?

344
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,500
Something's going on,
and I want some answers!

345
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,700
- Where you going?
- After the third ring.

346
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,100
I beg your pardon!

347
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:51,200
- Hello. Oh, hi, Mum.
- Mum?

348
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,800
Yes, I'm fine.
Busy, busy, busy.

349
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,500
Lots of company.

350
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,600
What have you gotten
yourself into?

351
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,800
I'll explain later, Pepper.
Right now, I need into my office.

352
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,900
That 's gonna be a bit difficult, since I
have SHIELD agents crawling up my...

353
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,700
Pepper, I know.
Can you arrange it?

354
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,600
You know the east stairwell door
that leads to the outside?

355
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,400
I'll make sure it's unlocked.

356
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:39,500
Hello? Tony!
I can hardly hear you!

357
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,400
How did you two sneak
into the lobby?

358
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,700
You have to get out there
before the agents...

359
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,200
Tony! Tony!

360
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,700
- Oh darn!
- Suspects are in the lobby! I repeat.

361
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,400
Suspects are in the lobby!

362
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,200
Remind me to move my office
to the first floor.

363
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,900
So, I want assets from these three
offshore accounts made available...

364
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,000
and keep it on the down low.

365
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,800
What, we came here
so you can do business?

366
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,200
Not exactly.

367
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,300
Access code: Maria.

368
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,700
Access granted.

369
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,400
What the?

370
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,800
Greetings, Mr. Stark.

371
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,400
Since when do you
have a secret room?

372
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,500
Come on, Rhodey.

373
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,900
Pepper, I owe you one.

374
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,600
And I'm keeping track.

375
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,000
Lights.

376
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,500
Interactive exo-suits.

377
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,600
With these things,
one person can accomplish...

378
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,500
what it normally would take dozens.

379
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,600
Exploration of any hostile
environments...

380
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,800
deep sea, volcanoes,
space, anything.

381
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,600
These armors will change the world.

382
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,100
And since the next place on the map
is on the floor of the Atlantic...

383
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,800
the aquatic model is going
to get me there.

384
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,300
- Something wrong?
- Just something you came up with?

385
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,000
I know. Sorry.

386
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,100
But I just wanted to keep it
top-secret.

387
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,100
Top-secret?

388
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
- Yeah. You're full of it, Tony.
- Rhodey.

389
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,400
This is what you hired me for,
isn't it?

390
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,300
To work with you
in development?

391
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,800
I was going to bring you in
when the time was right.

392
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,600
When the time was...

393
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,800
Why don't you just own up to it,
Tony?

394
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,500
You didn't trust me enough
to be a part of this project!

395
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,500
I mean, I'm your closest friend!
I've always been in your corner!

396
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,500
Come on, Rhodey, you're making
this personal. We're friends.

397
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:08,800
Why are you overreacting?

398
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,200
I'm the only one who
sees it for what it is!

399
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,900
Remember when your father
took your stuff...

400
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,700
and put it into his weapon's program?

401
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,700
How betrayed you felt?
Well, guess what, Tony?

402
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,600
You're just like him!

403
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,900
You know what? You're right.
We've got a lot to talk about.

404
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,900
But right now, I need your help.

405
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,300
This must be the place.

406
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:57,000
Spectrum analysis:
Unknown energy source detected.

407
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,300
Sweet dreams.

408
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:42,900
Warning. Warning.
Suit integrity compromised.

409
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,500
Warning. Armor breach.

410
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,900
Life support failing.

411
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:22,300
- Looks like it didn't go so well.
- It 's real, Rhodey. All of this.

412
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:26,800
What I fought today I can't even
begin to explain, but it is real!

413
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:30,200
- What have I done?
- It 's not your fault.

414
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,700
Release armor!

415
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,500
Rhodey, I raised that ancient city!
I set this in motion! It is my fault!

416
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,600
And true to form, my father
has made everything worse!

417
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,900
You're not gonna do
something stupid, are you?

418
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,300
Absolutely.

419
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,400
- You sold me out!
- I did no such thing!

420
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,500
You needed a guy for
the Chinese government...

421
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,400
so you trumped up
a phony arms deal!

422
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,800
Underhanded ethics
are your domain, not mine.

423
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:10,600
Don't talk to me about ethics.

424
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,200
You loaded weapons onto the jet
for Rhodey knowing I was against it!

425
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,200
They got stolen
and people died.

426
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,000
- Now they're blaming me for those!
- Rhodey needed protection!

427
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,600
You left him out there
with nothing!

428
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,800
They attacked us with
our own guns, Dad!

429
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,900
I wouldn't be on the run
if you'd just stayed out of it!

430
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,400
Why don't you drop
this pacifist bull?!

431
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,300
Military contracts are
what built this company!

432
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:33,500
No, it started the company.
I built it and without a single weapon!

433
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:36,400
Listen to you!
You sound just like...

434
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:39,700
Go on! Like my mother?

435
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:43,000
She hated the work I did, and she
got you believing that weapons...

436
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,000
How dare you blame her
for any of this?!

437
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,700
She stood by you, Dad!
She defended you!

438
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,200
When are you gonna stop blaming me
for her death? I lost her, too.

439
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,000
Yeah, but I lost you both!

440
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,600
- Pepper.
- Hi, Tony. Tony!

441
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,600
Clumsy me.

442
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,800
You're aiding and abetting
a fugitive, Miss Potts!

443
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,400
I don't know how you're helping him,
but you are.

444
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,500
And that 's enough
to take you into custody.

445
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:43,700
Fine. I could use the rest.

446
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,200
I've pulled data on the
fourth ring's location.

447
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,400
It looks like it 's right in the center
of an active volcano.

448
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,800
We've got bigger problems. They're
on to us and Pepper's been arrested.

449
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,700
Slipping past them is definitely
gonna be a problem.

450
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,500
- Then I'll lure them away.
- What?

451
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,700
- No, Rhodey. They'll arrest you!
- Look...

452
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,300
I'm open to other options,
but face it...

453
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,300
we're trapped in here and
you gotta get to Central America.

454
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,500
Rhodey, thanks.

455
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,400
Hey, it 's what friends do.

456
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,800
Hey, Jake and Elwood!

457
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,000
We got him on the roof!

458
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:41,700
I'll take that.

459
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,800
Okay, fellas, take it easy.

460
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,900
Just... stay down!

461
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,900
Lose something, Rockslide?

462
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,000
Tony.

463
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,200
Li Mei!

464
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:13,700
- What are you doing here?
- I did not know where else to go.

465
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:15,100
I tried your building, but...

466
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:18,600
Yeah, it 's complicated. Listen,
I went after the Mandarin's rings.

467
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,700
I know. Why would you do that?

468
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:23,700
- I had to.
- Did you get them?

469
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:26,600
- Just one.
- And what of the Elementals?

470
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,600
Only the Earth-Mover's left.

471
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:32,900
Then you're not safe! He will seek out
that ring wherever it is!

472
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:37,400
Please, give it to me!
It is my responsibility!

473
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,700
There's no way I'm letting
that thing come after you!

474
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:42,400
Tony, it is not your burden.

475
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:46,600
- There must be another way.
- No, there is not.

476
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:50,100
What about the tomb?
What if I destroy it? Will it end?

477
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:53,400
- Li Mei, tell me!
- I don't know.

478
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:57,900
Then it 's worth a try.
But I'm gonna need some armor.

479
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:05,400
- Hello?
- Is this line secure?

480
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:12,000
Tony. Son, yes, of course it is!
Are you okay? I've been so worried.

481
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,600
Dad...

482
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:15,600
...what 's going on?
- Nothing.

483
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,500
Everything's fine, really.
Tell me, what do you need?

484
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:22,000
They've got Pepper and Rhodey.
Can you get me into the building?

485
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,000
Absolutely, Tony.
I'll clear the way.

486
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,600
Just come on up, okay?
I'll take care of everything.

487
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,300
I love you, son.

488
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,600
They were listening.
He was warning me away.

489
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,300
I don't know what else to do.

490
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,800
Unless...

491
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:44,800
Come on!

492
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,600
I have had enough of you!

493
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:26,400
Here, take these.
I'm going after the temple.

494
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:29,700
Maybe the fifth ring is
still in the tomb with him.

495
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,400
It isn't.

496
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,200
It 's here.

497
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:42,900
- Your bracelet?
- You must go. Please.

498
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:45,300
Li Mei, what is going on?

499
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:49,500
I begged you not to come!
I've done everything I could...

500
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:52,000
...to keep you away!
- What?

501
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,800
I gave the government those
documents, so they'd arrest you.

502
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,200
- Why?
- To save your life!

503
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:00,300
I told you, I have a responsibility.

504
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:04,000
- I know, to stop the Mandarin.
- Not to stop him!

505
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,000
To ensure his resurrection.

506
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,300
What are you saying?

507
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:16,500
You mean, joining the Jade Dragons,
the things you said to me...

508
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:20,300
I am the last descendant
of the Mandarin. It falls to me.

509
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:24,100
I must be his vessel,
so he may walk the earth again.

510
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,100
Li Mei, listen,
you don't have to do this.

511
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:32,100
"This"! It 's the only reason
I even exist!

512
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:35,300
The very purpose of my life!

513
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:40,000
Please go. While you still can.

514
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,800
I'm not going anywhere.

515
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,600
Then you will die.

516
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,700
Li Mei!

517
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,200
Li Mei, where are you?

518
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:12,900
Li Mei...

519
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:21,300
Li Mei, are you all right?
What happened?

520
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:25,800
Don't touch me!

521
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,500
She has served her purpose,
Iron Knight.

522
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:45,200
As for you, your blood
must now be shed...

523
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,400
and the prophecy
will be fulfilled.

524
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:13,300
Li Mei! I know you're in there!

525
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:18,400
Please! Don't do this!

526
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:58,100
Listen to me!
Remember who you are!

527
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:00,800
You are Li Mei!

528
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,600
You are Li Mei!

529
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,600
Kill him!

530
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,400
Kill him!

531
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:32,600
Get away from him!

532
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,200
Li Mei.

533
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:51,100
- Tony?
- I'm right here.

534
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:53,200
You...

535
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,900
saved me.

536
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:58,300
You saved me, too.

537
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:52,600
Tony! Thank you for coming in.

538
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:57,300
I apologize for being late.
I'd to finish my interview with SHIELD.

539
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:02,100
We're happy to hear the Chinese
government cleared all charges.

540
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:05,400
Tony, let me get right to the point.

541
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:09,700
We've just learned over that last week,
someone has been buying up stock.

542
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:13,600
So much stock that this board
no longer has controlling interest.

543
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:16,200
And you suspect that
I'm that "someone".

544
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,500
Well... yes.

545
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:23,300
You're correct.
Stark Enterprises is mine.

546
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:31,900
I would just like to remind you that,
as a board of directors...

547
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:36,200
we have always, always, had the
company's best interest at heart.

548
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,700
- Now, sometimes we may have acted...
- I have two orders of business.

549
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,100
One.

550
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:48,400
I'm promoting James Rhodes to Chief
Engineer for Advanced Technologies.

551
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:53,600
- Thanks, man.
- You've earned it.

552
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:58,100
And two, I'm handing control
of the company over to my father.

553
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:02,400
- What?
- It 's yours, Dad.

554
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:07,100
The future of the company
is now yours to decide.

555
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:13,900
You know, I've always seen this
as a father-son enterprise.

556
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:24,700
Wonderful news, Tony, Howard.
We'll support you both 11O percent.

557
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:25,900
Shut up, Boyer!

558
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:29,000
My first order of business.

559
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,400
You're all fired!

560
01:20:32,400 --> 01:25:00,000
