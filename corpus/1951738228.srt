1
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,650
I have sailed the world,
beheld its wonders

2
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:57,194
From the Dardanelles to
the mountains of Peru,

3
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,856
But there's no
place like London

4
00:04:02,336 --> 00:04:05,897
No, there's no
place like London.

5
00:04:06,553 --> 00:04:07,136
Mr. Todd-?

6
00:04:08,966 --> 00:04:10,209
You are young.

7
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:13,460
Life has been kind to you.

8
00:04:16,886 --> 00:04:21,533
You will learn.

9
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:37,706
There's a hole in the
world like a great black pit

10
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,755
And the vermin of
the world Inhabit it

11
00:04:39,994 --> 00:04:42,048
And its morals aren't
worth what a pig could spit

12
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,658
And it goes by the name of London.

13
00:04:46,034 --> 00:04:47,840
At the top of the hole
sit the privileged few

14
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,646
Making mock of the
vermin in the lower zoo,

15
00:04:49,681 --> 00:04:51,896
turning beauty into filth and greed.

16
00:04:51,931 --> 00:04:56,757
I too have sailed the world,
and seen its wonders

17
00:04:57,093 --> 00:05:01,215
For the cruelty of men
is as wondrous as Peru,

18
00:05:01,563 --> 00:05:06,993
but there's no
place like London!

19
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:25,379
Is everything all right, Mr. Todd?

20
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:29,595
I beg your indulgence, Anthony...

21
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:33,085
My mind is far from easy.

22
00:05:35,064 --> 00:05:38,676
In these once familiar
streets I feel shadows

23
00:05:40,371 --> 00:05:41,630
Shadows...?

24
00:05:43,323 --> 00:05:45,442
Ghosts.

25
00:05:52,068 --> 00:05:55,081
There was a barber and his wife,

26
00:05:55,494 --> 00:05:58,630
and she was beautiful.

27
00:05:59,664 --> 00:06:02,482
A foolish barber and his wife,

28
00:06:03,052 --> 00:06:05,677
she was his reason and his life,

29
00:06:06,182 --> 00:06:09,997
and she was beautiful,

30
00:06:10,241 --> 00:06:13,884
and she was virtuous.

31
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,070
And he was... Naive.

32
00:06:32,093 --> 00:06:39,031
There was another man who saw
that she was beautiful,

33
00:06:39,413 --> 00:06:42,800
A pious vulture of the law,

34
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:46,292
who with a gesture of his claw

35
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:49,568
removed the barber from his plate.

36
00:06:49,934 --> 00:06:53,572
Then there was nothing but to wait

37
00:06:54,585 --> 00:06:56,887
and she would fall,

38
00:06:57,109 --> 00:06:57,996
So soft,

39
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,209
So young,

40
00:06:59,244 --> 00:07:00,133
So lost,

41
00:07:00,168 --> 00:07:04,780
and oh, so beautiful!

42
00:07:07,222 --> 00:07:10,404
And the lady, sir... did she succumb?

43
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,775
Oh, that was many years ago...

44
00:07:18,658 --> 00:07:23,411
I doubt if anyone would know.

45
00:07:31,058 --> 00:07:32,743
I'd like to thank you, Anthony.

46
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:37,617
If you hadn't spotted me,
I'd be lost on the ocean still...

47
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,433
Will I see you again?

48
00:07:41,273 --> 00:07:43,178
You might find me, if you like,

49
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:47,311
around Fleet Street.

50
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:53,560
Until then, my friend.

51
00:08:02,472 --> 00:08:04,016
There's a hole in the world
like a great black pit

52
00:08:04,248 --> 00:08:06,201
and it's filled with people
who are filled with shit

53
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:08,251
And the vermin of
the world inhabit it...

54
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:03,812
A customer!

55
00:09:04,158 --> 00:09:05,776
Wait! What's your rush?
What's your hurry?

56
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,358
You gave me such a- Fright.
I thought you was a ghost.

57
00:09:08,655 --> 00:09:09,776
Half a minute, can't you? Sit!

58
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:10,637
Sit ye down!
Sit!

59
00:09:10,672 --> 00:09:13,626
All I meant is that I haven't
seen a customer for weeks.

60
00:09:13,661 --> 00:09:16,144
Did you come here for a pie, sir?

61
00:09:16,374 --> 00:09:18,504
Do forgive me if me head's
a little vague- Ugh!

62
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:21,390
What is that? But you'd think
we had the plague-

63
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:22,710
From the way that people-

64
00:09:22,745 --> 00:09:23,610
Keep avoiding-

65
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:24,695
No, you don't!

66
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,067
These are probably
the worst pies in London.

67
00:09:27,102 --> 00:09:29,235
But there's no one comes in
even to inhale-

68
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:32,298
Right you are, sir.
Would you like a drop of ale?

69
00:09:32,577 --> 00:09:35,234
Mind you, I can't hardly blame them-

70
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:39,379
These are probably
the worst pies in London.

71
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:42,179
I know why nobody cares to take them-

72
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,805
I should know, I make them.

73
00:09:45,161 --> 00:09:48,990
But good? No,
the worst pies in London-

74
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:50,420
Even that's polite.

75
00:09:50,455 --> 00:09:52,773
The worst pies in London-

76
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,934
If you doubt it, take a bite.

77
00:09:57,427 --> 00:09:59,492
Is that just disgusting?

78
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:01,760
You have to concede it.

79
00:10:02,241 --> 00:10:04,163
It's nothing but crusting-

80
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,460
Here, drink this, you'll need it-

81
00:10:06,882 --> 00:10:09,497
The worst pies in London.

82
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,622
And no wonder with the price of meat.
What it is-

83
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,978
When you get it.
Never.

84
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,780
Thought I'd live to see the day
men'd think it was a treat

85
00:10:17,002 --> 00:10:18,587
Finding poor
animals

86
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,461
wot are dying in the street.

87
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:22,092
Mrs. Mooney has a pie shop,

88
00:10:22,604 --> 00:10:24,907
Does a business, but I noticed
something weird-

89
00:10:25,164 --> 00:10:27,449
Lately all her neighbors' cats
have disappeared.

90
00:10:27,749 --> 00:10:30,781
Have to hand it to her-
Wot I calls enterprise,

91
00:10:31,032 --> 00:10:32,419
Popping pussies into pies.

92
00:10:32,905 --> 00:10:34,295
Wouldn't do in my shop-

93
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,349
Just the thought of it's enough
to make you sick.

94
00:10:37,594 --> 00:10:39,813
And I'm telling you
them pussy cats is quick.

95
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:43,784
No denying times is hard, sir -

96
00:10:44,424 --> 00:10:47,694
Even harder than the worst pies in London.

97
00:10:48,426 --> 00:10:50,101
Only lard and nothing more-

98
00:10:50,136 --> 00:10:51,776
Is that just revolting?

99
00:10:52,034 --> 00:10:56,130
All greasy and gritty,
it looks like it's molting,

100
00:10:56,474 --> 00:11:00,216
And tastes like-
Well, pity

101
00:11:00,445 --> 00:11:07,500
a woman alone
with limited wind

102
00:11:07,727 --> 00:11:12,606
and the worst pies in London!

103
00:11:13,277 --> 00:11:15,077
Ah sir, times is hard.
Times is hard.

104
00:11:26,155 --> 00:11:28,366
Trust me, dearie, it's going to take
more than ale

105
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:30,454
to wash that taste out.

106
00:11:31,286 --> 00:11:34,096
Come with me and we'll get
you a nice tumbler of gin.

107
00:11:47,261 --> 00:11:48,016
Isn't this homey now?

108
00:11:49,874 --> 00:11:51,715
Me cheery wallpaper was
a real bargain too,

109
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,483
it being only partly singed when the
chapel burnt down...

110
00:11:55,013 --> 00:11:57,437
There's a good boy, now you sit down
and warm your bones,

111
00:11:59,132 --> 00:12:02,972
Isn't that a room over the shop?
If times are so hard,

112
00:12:03,007 --> 00:12:04,827
why don't you rent it out?

113
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:07,711
Up there?
Oh, no one will go near it...

114
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:11,136
People think it's haunted.

115
00:12:12,755 --> 00:12:14,120
Haunted?

116
00:12:16,022 --> 00:12:18,319
And who's to say they're wrong?...

117
00:12:19,182 --> 00:12:22,119
You see, years ago,
something happened up there.

118
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:24,444
Something not very nice...

119
00:12:28,093 --> 00:12:34,496
There was a barber and his wife,
and he was beautiful,

120
00:12:35,653 --> 00:12:41,748
a proper artist with a knife,
but they transported him for life.

121
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:46,459
And he was beautiful...

122
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:51,650
Barker, his name was - Benjamin Barker.

123
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,314
Transported? What was his crime?

124
00:12:55,003 --> 00:12:57,160
Foolishness.

125
00:12:57,602 --> 00:12:59,665
He had this wife, you see,

126
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,540
pretty little thing,

127
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:02,458
silly little nit.

128
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,711
Had her chance for the moon on a string-

129
00:13:06,771 --> 00:13:07,921
Poor thing. Poor thing.

130
00:13:14,303 --> 00:13:18,023
There was this Judge, you see,
wanted her like mad.

131
00:13:18,058 --> 00:13:19,965
Every day he’d send her a flower,

132
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:23,664
but did she come down from her tower?

133
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:29,452
Sat up there and sobbed by the hour,
Poor fool.

134
00:13:30,448 --> 00:13:33,245
Ah, but there was worse
yet to come, poor thing.

135
00:13:40,704 --> 00:13:43,535
The Beadle calls on her, all polite,

136
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:46,708
poor thing, poor thing.

137
00:13:47,254 --> 00:13:50,128
The Judge, he tells her,
is all controlled,

138
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:53,392
he blames himself for her dreadful plight

139
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,536
She must come straight
to his house tonight!

140
00:13:56,979 --> 00:13:59,662
Poor thing, poor thing.

141
00:14:05,163 --> 00:14:07,554
Of course, when she goes there,
poor thing, poor thing,

142
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:10,577
they're having this ball all in masks.

143
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,777
There's no one she knows there,
poor dear, poor thing.

144
00:14:14,088 --> 00:14:16,953
She wanders tormented, and drinks,
poor thing.

145
00:14:17,263 --> 00:14:19,936
The Judge has repented, she thinks,
poor thing.

146
00:14:20,217 --> 00:14:23,021
Oh, where is Judge Turpin?
She asks.

147
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:25,938
He was there, all right-

148
00:14:26,216 --> 00:14:27,606
Only not so contrite!

149
00:14:30,859 --> 00:14:33,585
She wasn’t no match for such craft,
you see,

150
00:14:33,944 --> 00:14:36,507
And everyone thought it so droll.

151
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,474
They figured she had to be daft,
you see,

152
00:14:39,852 --> 00:14:42,536
So all of ‘em stood there
and laughed, you see,

153
00:14:42,988 --> 00:14:44,038
Poor soul!
Poor thing!

154
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,457
...NOOOOOO!

155
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,633
Would no one have mercy on her?

156
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:06,907
So it is you - Benjamin Barker.

157
00:15:08,563 --> 00:15:13,442
Where's Lucy?!
Where’s my wife?!

158
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:15,618
She poisoned herself.

159
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,237
Arsenic from the
apothecary on the corner.

160
00:15:21,072 --> 00:15:24,828
I tried to stop her but she
wouldn't listen to me.

161
00:15:28,031 --> 00:15:30,240
And he's got your daughter.

162
00:15:32,189 --> 00:15:33,039
He? Judge Turpin?

163
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:41,254
Adopted her like his own.

164
00:15:42,682 --> 00:15:49,115
Fifteen years of sweating in a
living hell on a false charge.

165
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,433
Fifteen years dreaming that
I might come home

166
00:15:53,468 --> 00:15:55,776
to find a loving wife and child...

167
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,580
Well, I can't say the years have been

168
00:15:58,581 --> 00:16:00,889
particularly kind to you,
Mr. Barker, but you still-

169
00:16:01,704 --> 00:16:06,218
No, not Barker. That man is dead.

170
00:16:06,935 --> 00:16:10,314
It's Todd now. Sweeney Todd...

171
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:14,247
And he will have his revenge.

172
00:16:46,908 --> 00:16:50,805
Come in! Nothing to
be afraid of, love.

173
00:17:38,176 --> 00:17:39,980
When they came for the girl, I hid 'em.

174
00:17:41,253 --> 00:17:42,292
I hid just some of 'em.

175
00:17:55,829 --> 00:17:58,655
Those handles is chased
silver, ain't they?

176
00:18:00,352 --> 00:18:03,105
Silver, yes...

177
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:16,802
These are my friends,

178
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:21,839
see how they glisten.

179
00:18:22,544 --> 00:18:25,971
See this one shine,

180
00:18:26,653 --> 00:18:31,080
how he smiles in the light.

181
00:18:31,454 --> 00:18:38,946
My friend, my faithful friend.

182
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:45,692
Speak to me friend,

183
00:18:46,303 --> 00:18:50,261
Whisper, I'll listen.

184
00:18:50,979 --> 00:18:54,115
I know, I know-

185
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,774
You've been locked out of sight

186
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:01,601
all these years-

187
00:19:01,914 --> 00:19:05,313
Like me, my friend.

188
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:09,506
Well, I've come home

189
00:19:10,285 --> 00:19:14,798
To find you waiting.

190
00:19:16,224 --> 00:19:18,284
Home,

191
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:22,034
and we're together,

192
00:19:23,393 --> 00:19:26,816
and we'll do wonders,

193
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,417
won't we?

194
00:19:32,418 --> 00:19:37,262
You there, my friend,
- I'm your friend too, Mr. Todd,

195
00:19:37,632 --> 00:19:40,886
come, let me hold you.
- If you only knew, Mr. Todd.

196
00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:43,641
Now, with a sigh
- Oh, Mr. Todd,

197
00:19:43,903 --> 00:19:46,951
you're warm in my hand,

198
00:19:47,363 --> 00:19:50,555
- My friend,
- You've come home.

199
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:57,449
- My clever friend.
- Always had a fondness for you, i did.

200
00:19:57,714 --> 00:20:02,431
Rest now, my friends.
- Never you fear, Mr. Todd,

201
00:20:02,466 --> 00:20:06,702
Soon I'll unfold you.
- you can move in here, Mr. Todd.

202
00:20:06,922 --> 00:20:13,860
Soon you'll know splendors you
never have dreamed all your days...

203
00:20:14,098 --> 00:20:18,062
will be yours.
- My lucky friends.

204
00:20:18,281 --> 00:20:22,272
I'm your friend too.
- Till now your shine

205
00:20:22,473 --> 00:20:27,340
I think they shine beautiful.
- was merely silver.

206
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:32,208
Silver's good enough for me, Mr. Todd.
- Friends,

207
00:20:32,243 --> 00:20:36,505
you shall drip rubies,

208
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:45,448
You'll soon drip precious rubies...

209
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,888
Leave me...

210
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:13,022
At last my arm is complete again.

211
00:22:13,825 --> 00:22:15,415
Green finch and linnet bird,

212
00:22:15,717 --> 00:22:17,603
nightingale, blackbird,

213
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:21,405
how is it you sing?

214
00:22:22,088 --> 00:22:26,005
How can you jubilate,
sitting in cages,

215
00:22:26,238 --> 00:22:29,727
never taking wing?

216
00:22:30,435 --> 00:22:35,043
Outside the sky waits,
beckoning, beckoning,

217
00:22:35,382 --> 00:22:38,171
just beyond the bars.

218
00:22:39,795 --> 00:22:42,733
How can you remain,
staring at the rain,

219
00:22:42,964 --> 00:22:47,045
maddened by the stars?

220
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:53,063
How is it you sing
anything?

221
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:57,282
How is it you sing?

222
00:23:11,302 --> 00:23:14,677
My cage has many rooms,
damask and dark.

223
00:23:15,347 --> 00:23:20,616
Nothing there sings,
not even my lark.

224
00:23:21,073 --> 00:23:25,131
Larks never will, you know,
when they're captive.

225
00:23:25,383 --> 00:23:30,437
Teach me to be more adaptive.

226
00:23:36,213 --> 00:23:39,765
Green finch and linnet bird,
nightingale, blackbird,

227
00:23:40,325 --> 00:23:44,015
Teach me how to sing.

228
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:46,649
If I cannot fly,
let me sing.

229
00:24:09,564 --> 00:24:12,202
Alms!... Alms!...

230
00:24:12,556 --> 00:24:23,362
For a miserable woman
on a miserable chilly morning...

231
00:24:25,426 --> 00:24:27,352
Thank you, sir, thank you.

232
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:32,074
Ma’am, could tell me whose house this is?

233
00:24:32,356 --> 00:24:34,949
That’s the great Judge Turpin’s house,
that is.

234
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:37,165
And the young lady who resides there?

235
00:24:38,074 --> 00:24:41,448
That’s Johanna, his pretty little ward.

236
00:24:41,952 --> 00:24:44,796
Keeps her snug, he does, all locked up...

237
00:24:45,921 --> 00:24:50,496
So don’t you go trespassing there
or it’s a good whipping for you

238
00:24:50,843 --> 00:24:54,439
or any other young man with
mischief on his mind...

239
00:24:55,239 --> 00:25:02,328
Alms!... Alms!...
For a desperate woman...

240
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:14,800
I feel you, Johanna.

241
00:25:15,334 --> 00:25:17,800
I feel you.

242
00:25:19,804 --> 00:25:23,387
I was half convinced I'd waken,

243
00:25:23,747 --> 00:25:27,613
Satisfied enough to dream you.

244
00:25:27,871 --> 00:25:35,000
Happily I was mistaken, Johanna!

245
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:43,000
I'll steal you, Johanna.

246
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,238
I'll steal you...

247
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:04,271
Come in, lad. Come in...

248
00:26:11,314 --> 00:26:13,627
...you were looking for
Hyde Park, you say?

249
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,041
Yes, it's terribly large on the map
but I keep getting lost...

250
00:26:19,346 --> 00:26:21,176
Sit down, lad, sit down.

251
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:24,584
It's embarrassing for a
sailor to lose his bearings,

252
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,597
but, well, there you are.

253
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,340
A sailor, eh?

254
00:26:34,465 --> 00:26:36,839
Yes, sir. The "Bountiful" out of Plymouth.

255
00:26:37,322 --> 00:26:40,855
A sailor must know the ways of the world, yes?

256
00:26:42,024 --> 00:26:45,526
Must be practiced in the ways of the world...

257
00:26:45,734 --> 00:26:47,853
Would you say you are practiced, boy?

258
00:26:48,151 --> 00:26:49,577
Sir?

259
00:26:52,593 --> 00:26:58,438
Oh, yes... such practices...
the geishas of Japan...

260
00:26:59,324 --> 00:27:05,779
the concubines of Siam, the catamites
of Greece, the harlots of India...

261
00:27:07,738 --> 00:27:11,595
I have them all here...
Drawings of them.

262
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:16,993
All the vile things you've done with your whores.

263
00:27:19,177 --> 00:27:21,192
Would you like to see?

264
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,033
I think there's been some mistake-

265
00:27:24,663 --> 00:27:27,552
Oh, I think not.

266
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:33,316
You gandered at my ward, Johanna.
You gandered at her.

267
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:36,587
Yes, sir, you gandered.

268
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:38,088
I meant no harm-

269
00:27:38,353 --> 00:27:40,354
Your meaning is immaterial.

270
00:27:41,388 --> 00:27:46,281
Mark me: if I see your
face again on this street,

271
00:27:46,522 --> 00:27:51,411
you'll rue the day you were born.

272
00:27:54,034 --> 00:27:56,216
Hyde Park is that way, young sir...

273
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,711
A right and then a left,
then straight on, you see?

274
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:02,255
...Over there.

275
00:28:10,552 --> 00:28:13,866
You heard Judge Turpin, little man.

276
00:28:14,691 --> 00:28:20,571
Next time it'll be your pretty
brains all over the pavement.

277
00:28:44,017 --> 00:28:45,217
I'll steal you, Johanna.

278
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:55,693
I'll steal you!

279
00:28:56,642 --> 00:28:59,885
Do they think that walls can hide you?

280
00:29:00,267 --> 00:29:03,786
Even now I'm at your window.

281
00:29:04,334 --> 00:29:08,102
I am in the dark beside you,

282
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:16,669
buried sweetly in your yellow hair.

283
00:29:20,788 --> 00:29:21,788
I feel you, Johanna,

284
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,908
and one day I'll steal you.

285
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:40,315
Till I'm with you then,
I'm with you there,

286
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:47,377
sweetly buried in your yellow hair...

287
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:11,335
He's here every Thursday.
Italian. All the rage he is.

288
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,816
Ladies and gentlemen!
May I have your attention, please?

289
00:31:25,523 --> 00:31:29,857
Do you wake every morning in shame and despair
to discover your pillow is covered with hair

290
00:31:30,261 --> 00:31:31,989
wot ought not to be there?

291
00:31:32,727 --> 00:31:36,398
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
from now on you can waken at ease.

292
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:38,843
You need never again
have a worry or care,

293
00:31:38,844 --> 00:31:40,942
I will show you a
miracle marvelous rare,

294
00:31:42,482 --> 00:31:45,947
Gentlemen, you are about to see something
rot rose from the dead!

295
00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:50,229
On the top of my head.

296
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:55,560
'Twas Pirelli's Miracle Elixir,

297
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:58,969
That's wot did the trick, sir,
True, sir, true.

298
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,784
Was it quick, sir?
Did it in a tick, sir?

299
00:32:03,063 --> 00:32:06,187
Just like an elixir ought to do!

300
00:32:07,173 --> 00:32:08,564
How about a bottle, mister?

301
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,680
Only costs a penny, guaranteed.

302
00:32:14,108 --> 00:32:17,111
Does Pirelli's stimulate
the growth, sir?

303
00:32:17,395 --> 00:32:20,455
You can have my oath, sir,
'Tis unique.

304
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,238
Rub a minute,
Stimulatin', i'n it?

305
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:27,673
Soon you'll have to thin it once a week!

306
00:32:28,395 --> 00:32:29,909
Pardon me, ma'am, what's that awful stench?

307
00:32:29,944 --> 00:32:33,502
- Are we standing near an open trench?
- Must be standing near an open trench!

308
00:32:34,144 --> 00:32:36,381
Buy Pirelli's Miracle Elixir:

309
00:32:36,382 --> 00:32:40,083
Anything wot's slick,
sir, soon sprouts curls.

310
00:32:40,698 --> 00:32:43,886
Try Pirelli's!
When they see how thick, sir,

311
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:47,306
you can have your
pick, sir, of the girls!

312
00:32:48,221 --> 00:32:49,394
Want to buy a bottle, missus?

313
00:32:49,429 --> 00:32:50,568
What is this?
- What is this?

314
00:32:50,847 --> 00:32:52,266
Smells like piss.
- Smells like - phew!

315
00:32:53,616 --> 00:32:54,282
Looks like piss.

316
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:56,940
This is piss.
Piss with ink.

317
00:32:57,432 --> 00:32:58,693
Let Pirelli's activate your roots, sir-

318
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:00,361
Keep it off your boots, sir-
Eats right through.

319
00:33:00,613 --> 00:33:01,885
Yes, get Pirelli’s! Usable in all ways.

320
00:33:02,573 --> 00:33:03,241
Ladies seem to love it-

321
00:33:03,537 --> 00:33:04,424
Flies do too!

322
00:33:07,228 --> 00:33:09,584
I am Adolfo Pirelli,

323
00:33:10,084 --> 00:33:13,075
Da king of da barbers, da barber of kings,
E buon giorno, good day,

324
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:15,685
I blow you a kiss!

325
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:20,094
And I, da so-famous Pirelli,
I wish-a to know-a

326
00:33:20,405 --> 00:33:25,264
Who has-a da nerve-a to say
My elixir is piss!

327
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:28,671
Who says this?!

328
00:33:31,224 --> 00:33:32,342
I do.

329
00:33:34,895 --> 00:33:37,769
I am Mr. Sweeney Todd of Fleet Street.

330
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:43,166
I have opened a bottle of Pirelli's elixir,
and I say to you that it is

331
00:33:43,201 --> 00:33:48,419
nothing but an arrant fraud, concocted
from piss and ink.

332
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:51,413
And furthermore, "signor" -

333
00:33:52,103 --> 00:33:56,947
I have serviced no kings, yet
I wager I can shave a cheek

334
00:33:56,982 --> 00:34:01,792
with ten times more dexterity
that any street mountebank.

335
00:34:07,021 --> 00:34:08,664
You see these razors?

336
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:15,453
I lay them against five
pounds you are no match, sir.

337
00:34:16,042 --> 00:34:21,234
Either accept my challenge
or reveal yourself as a sham.

338
00:34:22,876 --> 00:34:25,331
You hear zis foolish man?

339
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:30,632
Now, please, you will see
how he will regret his folly!

340
00:34:31,771 --> 00:34:32,908
Toby!

341
00:34:33,622 --> 00:34:35,084
Who's for a free shave?

342
00:34:58,299 --> 00:35:00,434
Will Beadle Bamford be the judge?

343
00:35:00,756 --> 00:35:05,376
Glad, as always, to oblige
my friends and neighbors.

344
00:35:16,535 --> 00:35:17,336
Ready?

345
00:35:18,231 --> 00:35:19,272
Ready!

346
00:35:20,246 --> 00:35:21,522
Ready.

347
00:35:22,074 --> 00:35:26,888
The fastest, smoothest
shave is the winner.

348
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:53,825
Now, signorini, signori,
We mix-a da lather

349
00:35:54,076 --> 00:35:56,714
But first-a you gather around,
signorini, signori,

350
00:35:56,954 --> 00:36:00,062
you looking a man who have had-a
da glory to shave-a da Pope.

351
00:36:00,297 --> 00:36:02,250
Mr.
Sweeney-so-smart-

352
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:05,020
Oh, I beg-a you pardon - 'll call
me a lie, was-a only a cardinal-

353
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,256
Nope!
It was-a da Pope!

354
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:16,036
To shave-a da face,
To cut-a da hair,

355
00:36:16,071 --> 00:36:19,632
Require da grace
Require da flair,

356
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:23,193
For if-a you slip,
You nick da skin,

357
00:36:23,443 --> 00:36:26,821
You clip-a da chin, You rip-a
da lip a bit Beyond-a repair!

358
00:36:29,169 --> 00:36:33,884
To shave-a da face Or even a part

359
00:36:34,413 --> 00:36:39,027
Without it-a smart Require da heart.

360
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:47,419
Not just-a da flash, it take-a panache,
it take-a da passion for da art.

361
00:36:49,483 --> 00:36:53,928
To shave-a da face,
To trim-a da beard,

362
00:36:53,963 --> 00:36:58,374
To make-a da bristle
clean like a whistle,

363
00:36:59,005 --> 00:37:07,824
Dis is from early infancy
da talent give to me by God!

364
00:37:11,675 --> 00:37:15,745
It take-a da skill,
It take-a da brains,

365
00:37:16,206 --> 00:37:21,467
It take-a da will
to take-a da pains,

366
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:30,757
It take-a da pace,
it take-a da graaaaaace...

367
00:37:36,633 --> 00:37:39,913
The winner is Todd.

368
00:37:50,953 --> 00:37:55,300
Sir, I bow to a skill far
greater than my own.

369
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:59,661
The five pounds.

370
00:38:04,398 --> 00:38:06,880
May the good Lord smile on you...

371
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,740
until we meet again.

372
00:38:11,017 --> 00:38:12,161
Come, boy.

373
00:38:22,352 --> 00:38:25,851
Suppose it's just me gentle heart, but
I do hate to see a boy treated like that.

374
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,521
Congratulations, Mr. Todd.

375
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:32,043
May I ask you, sir, do you have
an own establishment?

376
00:38:32,901 --> 00:38:33,898
He certainly does.

377
00:38:34,463 --> 00:38:38,806
Sweeney Todd's Tonsorial Parlor -
above my meat pie emporium in Fleet Street.

378
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,651
I thank you, sir.

379
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:48,294
You are a paragon of integrity.

380
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,074
Well, I try to do my best for
my friends and neighbors...

381
00:38:53,714 --> 00:38:57,034
Your establishment is
in Fleet Street, you say?

382
00:38:57,498 --> 00:38:58,310
Yes, sir.

383
00:38:58,747 --> 00:39:04,035
Then, Mr. Todd, you will surely
see me there before the week is out.

384
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:06,756
You will be welcome, Beadle Bamford,

385
00:39:07,362 --> 00:39:10,521
and I can guarantee to give
you without a penny's charge,

386
00:39:11,427 --> 00:39:13,865
the closest shave you will ever know.

387
00:39:24,438 --> 00:39:25,016
Come on, off...

388
00:39:25,051 --> 00:39:26,952
...Like to give me a coronary right there!

389
00:40:46,095 --> 00:40:48,251
...It's not much of a chair,
but it'll do.

390
00:40:48,661 --> 00:40:50,033
Was me poor Albert's chair.

391
00:40:50,238 --> 00:40:51,831
Sat in it all day long he did,

392
00:40:52,056 --> 00:40:54,553
after his leg give out with the gout.

393
00:40:54,588 --> 00:40:56,258
Why doesn't the Beadle come?

394
00:40:56,293 --> 00:40:59,207
"Before the week is out,"
that's what he said.

395
00:40:59,601 --> 00:41:01,960
And who says the week's out?
It's only Tuesday.

396
00:41:07,172 --> 00:41:09,107
Easy now.

397
00:41:09,423 --> 00:41:11,309
Hush, love, hush.

398
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:15,756
Don’t distress yourself,
What’s your rush?

399
00:41:16,021 --> 00:41:20,095
Keep your thoughts
nice and lush.

400
00:41:20,312 --> 00:41:21,731
Wait.

401
00:41:24,769 --> 00:41:26,760
Hush, love, hush.

402
00:41:26,995 --> 00:41:28,996
Think it through.

403
00:41:29,222 --> 00:41:33,119
Once it bubbles,
then what’s to do?

404
00:41:33,347 --> 00:41:37,568
Watch it close.
Let it brew.

405
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:39,446
Wait.

406
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:43,114
I’ve been thinking, flowers-

407
00:41:43,414 --> 00:41:47,565
Maybe daisies-
To brighten up the room.

408
00:41:48,888 --> 00:41:53,508
Don’t you think some flowers,
pretty daisies,

409
00:41:54,099 --> 00:41:57,054
might relieve the gloom?

410
00:41:57,785 --> 00:42:03,925
Ah, wait, love, wait.

411
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:07,457
And the Judge?
When will we get to him?

412
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,361
Can't you think of nothing else?

413
00:42:09,669 --> 00:42:13,548
Always broodin' away on yer wrongs what
happened heaven knows how many years ago...

414
00:42:14,582 --> 00:42:15,359
Come on.

415
00:42:16,053 --> 00:42:17,959
Slow, love, slow.

416
00:42:18,326 --> 00:42:19,837
Time's so fast.

417
00:42:20,624 --> 00:42:24,623
Now goes quickly, see
Now it's past!

418
00:42:25,028 --> 00:42:28,393
Soon will come,
soon will last.

419
00:42:29,036 --> 00:42:30,357
Wait.

420
00:42:33,341 --> 00:42:37,006
Don’t you know,
silly man,

421
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:41,509
half the fun is to
plan the plan?

422
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:45,942
All good things come to
those who can

423
00:42:46,198 --> 00:42:49,150
wait.

424
00:42:50,462 --> 00:42:54,577
Gillyflowers, maybe,
'stead of daisies...

425
00:42:55,401 --> 00:42:57,338
I don’t know, though...

426
00:42:57,586 --> 00:42:59,964
What do you think?

427
00:43:09,676 --> 00:43:11,008
Oh, I'm sorry, excuse me...

428
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,470
Mrs. Lovett, sir.

429
00:43:12,505 --> 00:43:13,480
A pleasure, ma'am -

430
00:43:15,155 --> 00:43:17,019
Mr. Todd, there's a
girl who needs my help,

431
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,180
such a sad girl and lonely,
and beautiful too and-

432
00:43:19,215 --> 00:43:20,888
Slow down, slow down.

433
00:43:20,923 --> 00:43:22,561
Yes, I'm sorry...

434
00:43:24,207 --> 00:43:26,119
This girl has a guardian
who he keeps her locked away.

435
00:43:26,154 --> 00:43:28,469
But then this morning she dropped this...

436
00:43:28,504 --> 00:43:30,627
It's surely a sign that
Johanna wants me to help her

437
00:43:30,628 --> 00:43:31,708
that's her name, Johanna -

438
00:43:32,553 --> 00:43:35,186
and Turpin that of her guardian.
A judge of some sort...

439
00:43:36,042 --> 00:43:38,179
Once he goes to court, I’m going to
slip into the house and release her

440
00:43:38,214 --> 00:43:40,294
and beg her to come
away with me. Tonight.

441
00:43:40,435 --> 00:43:41,824
Oh, this is very romantic.

442
00:43:42,211 --> 00:43:45,389
Yes, but- I don't know
anyone in London, you see.

443
00:43:45,961 --> 00:43:49,253
And I need somewhere safe to bring her
till I've hired a coach to take us away.

444
00:43:50,139 --> 00:43:53,564
If I could keep her here, just for an hour
or two, I would forever be in your debt.

445
00:43:58,225 --> 00:43:59,755
Bring her here, love.

446
00:44:00,462 --> 00:44:01,322
Thank you, ma'am...

447
00:44:02,888 --> 00:44:04,281
...Mr. Todd?

448
00:44:06,228 --> 00:44:08,687
Thank you, my friend.

449
00:44:13,016 --> 00:44:16,185
Seems like the fates are
favoring you at last, Mr. T.

450
00:44:17,982 --> 00:44:18,856
What is it, love?

451
00:44:18,891 --> 00:44:21,005
You'll have her back
before the day is out.

452
00:44:22,222 --> 00:44:23,505
What about him?

453
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:30,926
Oh, him? Let him bring her here and
then, since you're so hot for a little -

454
00:44:32,665 --> 00:44:34,945
that's the throat to slit, my dear.

455
00:44:37,056 --> 00:44:38,524
Poor little Johanna.

456
00:44:38,898 --> 00:44:42,192
All those years without a
scrap of motherly affection.

457
00:44:42,961 --> 00:44:45,911
Well, we'll soon see to that...

458
00:44:59,308 --> 00:45:00,822
Keep the boy downstairs.

459
00:45:12,896 --> 00:45:15,449
Signora, is Mr. Todd at home?

460
00:45:15,664 --> 00:45:16,992
Plying his trade upstairs...

461
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:19,923
Would you look at it, now!

462
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:23,090
You wouldn't mind if I gave him
a nice juicy meat pie, would yer?

463
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:25,047
Yes, yes, whatever you like.

464
00:45:25,824 --> 00:45:28,910
Come with me now.
Your teeth is strong, I hope?

465
00:45:37,683 --> 00:45:39,298
Sit down,

466
00:45:47,427 --> 00:45:48,917
Come in.

467
00:45:57,774 --> 00:45:59,187
Mr. Todd.

468
00:45:59,479 --> 00:46:01,185
Signor Pirelli.

469
00:46:02,091 --> 00:46:03,218
Call me Danny. Daniel Higgins' the

470
00:46:04,564 --> 00:46:06,987
Daniel Higgins' the name
when it's not professional...

471
00:46:09,293 --> 00:46:11,686
I'd like me five quid
back, if' n ya don't mind.

472
00:46:11,721 --> 00:46:12,520
Why?

473
00:46:12,864 --> 00:46:16,360
Because you entered into our little
wager on false pretenses, me friend...

474
00:46:17,129 --> 00:46:19,986
And so you might remember to be
more forthright in the future,

475
00:46:22,096 --> 00:46:25,096
you'll be handing over half your
profits to me, share and share alike...

476
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:30,684
...Mr. Benjamin Barker.

477
00:46:35,151 --> 00:46:37,525
Here you are, tuck in.

478
00:46:39,524 --> 00:46:41,865
Like to see a man with a healthy appetite.

479
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:47,323
Reminds me of my dear Albert,
like to gorge himself to bloatation, he did.

480
00:46:48,618 --> 00:46:50,445
He didn't have your nice full head though-

481
00:46:50,985 --> 00:46:51,937
To tell the truth -

482
00:46:52,741 --> 00:46:54,279
it gets awful hot.

483
00:46:58,645 --> 00:47:00,056
...yes, this will do very nicely...

484
00:47:04,176 --> 00:47:06,626
You don't remember me.
Well, why should you?

485
00:47:07,612 --> 00:47:09,318
I was just a down and
out Irish pug you hired

486
00:47:09,353 --> 00:47:11,025
for a couple of weeks
- sweeping up hair -

487
00:47:13,103 --> 00:47:14,599
But I remember these -

488
00:47:15,963 --> 00:47:18,700
And how could I ever
forget you, Mr. Barker?

489
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:25,757
I used to sit right there,

490
00:47:26,409 --> 00:47:29,050
and dream of the day I could be
a proper barber meself...

491
00:47:29,445 --> 00:47:33,119
You might say you was an inspiration to me.

492
00:47:45,459 --> 00:47:50,021
So, do we have a deal, or
should I run down the street

493
00:47:50,022 --> 00:47:52,593
for me old pal Beadle Bamford?

494
00:47:56,249 --> 00:48:01,316
What do you say to
that now, Mr. Sweeney T-?

495
00:48:23,145 --> 00:48:26,147
My my my, always work to be done.

496
00:48:26,523 --> 00:48:28,206
Spic-and-span,
that's my motto.

497
00:48:41,249 --> 00:48:44,214
So, ah, how did you end up with
that dreadful italian?

498
00:48:44,857 --> 00:48:48,037
Got me from the workhouse.
Been there since I was born.

499
00:48:49,501 --> 00:48:51,577
Oh God! He's got an
appointment with his tailor-

500
00:48:51,923 --> 00:48:53,516
If he's late, he'll blame me-!

501
00:48:53,858 --> 00:48:54,861
Wait-!

502
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,192
Signor, you got an appointment...

503
00:49:09,521 --> 00:49:13,652
Signor Pirelli has been called away.
You better run after him.

504
00:49:14,346 --> 00:49:18,597
Oh no, sir. I better wait for
him here or it'll be a lashing.

505
00:49:18,598 --> 00:49:20,996
He's a great one for the lashings.

506
00:49:29,752 --> 00:49:32,223
So, hmmm, Mrs. Lovett
gave you a pie, did she?

507
00:49:32,258 --> 00:49:33,635
She's a real lady.

508
00:49:34,494 --> 00:49:36,378
That she is...

509
00:49:40,927 --> 00:49:45,980
But if I know a growing boy, there's
still room for some more pie, eh?

510
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:47,712
Yes, sir.

511
00:49:48,783 --> 00:49:50,913
Then why don't you wait
for your master downstairs?

512
00:49:51,633 --> 00:49:53,761
There'll be another pie
in it for you, I'm sure...

513
00:49:54,037 --> 00:49:55,881
No, I should stay here.

514
00:49:58,533 --> 00:49:59,565
I tell you what...

515
00:50:00,663 --> 00:50:05,634
Why don't you tell Mrs. Lovett I said
to give you a nice big tot of gin?

516
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:08,021
Thank you, sir!

517
00:51:16,029 --> 00:51:21,213
This is the second time, sir, that you
have been brought before this bench.

518
00:51:22,681 --> 00:51:26,685
Though it is my earnest wish to
ever temper justice with mercy,

519
00:51:26,998 --> 00:51:33,203
your persistent dedication to a life of
crime is an abomination before God and man.

520
00:51:33,858 --> 00:51:37,299
I therefore sentence you to hang
by the neck until you are dead

521
00:51:37,513 --> 00:51:40,023
and may the Lord have
mercy on your soul.

522
00:51:41,552 --> 00:51:42,415
This court is adjourned.

523
00:51:52,584 --> 00:51:56,695
Thank you, your Honor.
Just the sentence we wanted.

524
00:51:57,053 --> 00:51:58,364
Was he guilty?

525
00:51:58,685 --> 00:52:01,714
Well, if he didn't do it, he's surely
done something to warrant a hanging.

526
00:52:02,183 --> 00:52:04,135
What man has not?

527
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,741
Sir?

528
00:52:07,777 --> 00:52:08,498
No matter -

529
00:52:09,202 --> 00:52:11,893
Come, walk home with me.

530
00:52:15,859 --> 00:52:17,777
I have news for you, my friend.

531
00:52:18,731 --> 00:52:21,428
In order to shield her from
the evils of this world,

532
00:52:21,463 --> 00:52:24,318
I have decided to marry my dear Johanna.

533
00:52:24,553 --> 00:52:27,455
Ah, sir, happy news indeed.

534
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:35,207
Strange, though, when I offered myself
to her she showed a certain... reluctance.

535
00:52:36,263 --> 00:52:38,583
Excuse me, my lord,
May I request, my lord,

536
00:52:38,825 --> 00:52:41,156
Permission, my lord, to speak?

537
00:52:41,372 --> 00:52:43,457
Forgive me if I suggest, my lord,

538
00:52:43,663 --> 00:52:46,077
You're looking less
than your best, my lord,

539
00:52:46,112 --> 00:52:48,260
There's powder upon your vest, my lord.

540
00:52:48,295 --> 00:52:51,201
And stubble upon your cheek,

541
00:52:54,108 --> 00:52:58,331
And ladies, my lord, are weak.

542
00:52:59,021 --> 00:53:01,162
Stubble, you say?

543
00:53:04,535 --> 00:53:08,587
Perhaps at times I am a little
overhasty with my morning ablutions...

544
00:53:09,154 --> 00:53:11,213
Fret not though, my lord,
I know a place, my lord,

545
00:53:11,248 --> 00:53:13,633
A barber, my lord, of skill.

546
00:53:14,178 --> 00:53:16,376
Thus armed with a shaven face, my lord,

547
00:53:16,411 --> 00:53:18,575
Some eau de cologne to brace my lord

548
00:53:18,796 --> 00:53:21,045
And musk to enhance the chase, my lord,

549
00:53:21,325 --> 00:53:31,068
You'll dazzle the girl until
she bows to your every will.

550
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:35,986
A barber, eh? Take me to him.

551
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:38,277
His name is Todd, my lord.

552
00:53:38,312 --> 00:53:40,791
And he is the very
last word in barberin'.

553
00:53:47,579 --> 00:53:49,120
You ought to slow down a bit, lad.

554
00:53:49,357 --> 00:53:50,846
It'll go to your head.

555
00:53:51,173 --> 00:53:54,277
They used to give it to us at the
workhouse, so's we could sleep.

556
00:53:54,312 --> 00:53:56,976
Not that you'd ever want to
sleep in that place, ma'am.

557
00:53:57,011 --> 00:53:59,326
Not with the things
that happen in the dark.

558
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,626
That's nice, dear...

559
00:54:00,661 --> 00:54:02,807
I think I'll just pop in
on Mr. Todd for a tick.

560
00:54:02,842 --> 00:54:04,063
You'll be all right here?

561
00:54:04,098 --> 00:54:05,931
Leave the bottle.

562
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:14,744
Gawd, the lad is drinking
me out of house and home,

563
00:54:14,745 --> 00:54:17,186
how long until Pirelli gets back?

564
00:54:17,995 --> 00:54:20,426
He won't be back.

565
00:54:21,569 --> 00:54:23,389
Mr. T., you didn't!

566
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:36,270
You're barking mad!

567
00:54:36,305 --> 00:54:37,843
Killing a man wot done you no harm!

568
00:54:39,171 --> 00:54:41,012
He recognized me from the old days.

569
00:54:41,748 --> 00:54:45,603
He tried to blackmail
me - half me earnings.

570
00:54:46,668 --> 00:54:49,776
Oh well, that's a different matter!

571
00:54:50,401 --> 00:54:53,041
For a moment there I thought
you'd lost your marbles!

572
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:58,218
Ooooh! All that blood!

573
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:03,464
Poor bugger. Oh, well.

574
00:55:13,334 --> 00:55:14,695
Well, waste not, want not...

575
00:55:16,257 --> 00:55:16,912
So...

576
00:55:18,057 --> 00:55:19,694
What are we going to
do about the boy then?

577
00:55:20,978 --> 00:55:22,254
Send him up.

578
00:55:23,413 --> 00:55:25,806
Oh, we don't need to worry
about him, he's a simple thing.

579
00:55:26,438 --> 00:55:27,638
Send him up.

580
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,905
Now, Mr. T., surely
one's enough for today.

581
00:55:35,603 --> 00:55:38,451
'Sides, I was thinking about hiring
a lad to help around the shop,

582
00:55:39,151 --> 00:55:41,167
me poor knees not being
what they used to be.

583
00:55:42,579 --> 00:55:44,169
All right.

584
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:48,521
'Course we'll have to
stock up on the gin,

585
00:55:48,522 --> 00:55:50,327
the boy drinks like a Barbary sailor -

586
00:55:55,045 --> 00:55:56,784
The Judge.

587
00:55:59,728 --> 00:56:00,840
Get out.

588
00:56:03,082 --> 00:56:04,755
Get out!

589
00:56:20,867 --> 00:56:22,507
Mr. Todd?

590
00:56:23,416 --> 00:56:25,131
At your service...

591
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:29,450
An honor to receive
your patronage, my lord.

592
00:56:30,528 --> 00:56:32,402
You know me, sir?

593
00:56:32,747 --> 00:56:38,151
Who in this wide world does
not know the great Judge Turpin?

594
00:56:44,595 --> 00:56:48,225
These premises are hardly prepossessing
and yet the Beadle tells me

595
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:52,853
you are the most accomplished
of all the barbers in the city.

596
00:56:53,206 --> 00:56:55,555
That is gracious of him, sir...

597
00:56:56,523 --> 00:56:58,675
And what may I do for you today, sir?

598
00:56:59,659 --> 00:57:03,988
A stylish trimming of the hair?
A soothing skin massage?

599
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,865
Sit, sir. Sit.

600
00:57:07,476 --> 00:57:09,963
You see, sir, a man
infatuate with love,

601
00:57:09,998 --> 00:57:12,256
her ardent and eager slave.

602
00:57:12,291 --> 00:57:14,835
So fetch the pomade and pumice stone

603
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:17,345
and lend me a more seductive tone,

604
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:21,391
a sprinkling perhaps of French cologne,

605
00:57:21,426 --> 00:57:25,402
But first, sir, I think - a shave.

606
00:57:27,638 --> 00:57:31,450
The closest I ever gave.

607
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:37,807
You're in a merry mood today, Mr. Todd.

608
00:57:37,842 --> 00:57:42,468
'Tis your delight, sir, catching fire
from one man to the next.

609
00:57:42,874 --> 00:57:45,441
'Tis true, sir, love can still inspire

610
00:57:45,476 --> 00:57:47,840
the blood to pound,
the heart leap higher.

611
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:50,205
What more, what more can man require-

612
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:51,355
Than love, sir?

613
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:52,829
More than love, sir.

614
00:57:52,864 --> 00:57:53,707
What, sir?

615
00:57:53,742 --> 00:57:54,516
Women.

616
00:57:54,551 --> 00:57:55,422
Ah yes, women.

617
00:57:55,457 --> 00:57:56,293
Pretty women.
