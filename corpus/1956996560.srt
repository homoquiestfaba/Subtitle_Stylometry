00:00:00,308 --> 00:00:04,058
("Overture" by Jerry Herman)

2
00:00:11,772 --> 00:00:15,189
(pedestrians chattering)

3
00:01:48,424 --> 00:01:51,341
(elves chattering)

4
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:56,415
- [Elf] I love exercise.

5
00:01:56,415 --> 00:01:59,959
♫ Teddy's vest has satin lining

6
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:03,941
♫ And the locomotive's brass is shining

7
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:07,941
♫ And the sparkle and the gloss

8
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,655
♫ We attribute to the boss

9
00:02:20,109 --> 00:02:24,010
♫ Miss Muffet's hair is twice as curly

10
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,116
♫ And, we're wrapped and
packed and finished early

11
00:02:28,116 --> 00:02:31,949
♫ So, a big round of applause

12
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:38,436
♫ To our sturdy and smart

13
00:02:38,436 --> 00:02:39,716
♫ Top on the job

14
00:02:39,716 --> 00:02:41,194
♫ Soft in the heart

15
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,511
♫ Positive, practical

16
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:45,928
♫ Mrs. Claus

17
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,314
♫ We still have seven days till Christmas

18
00:02:53,314 --> 00:02:55,261
Oh team, we've done it.

19
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:57,469
1910 is a record year.

20
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,404
You are a magician Arvo.

21
00:02:59,404 --> 00:03:02,813
- No, you're the magician, Mrs. Claus.

22
00:03:02,813 --> 00:03:06,666
- Well, what counts is
we've done it all together.

23
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:10,122
I mean, look at these
wonderful teddy bears.

24
00:03:10,122 --> 00:03:12,893
They stand up to a lot of loving

25
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:13,726
and that is the most important test.

26
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,476
- [Elf] Oh yes it is.

27
00:03:16,756 --> 00:03:19,981
- And, now you can all
go home a week early.

28
00:03:19,981 --> 00:03:20,823
(elves gasping)

29
00:03:20,823 --> 00:03:23,137
And, have the very merriest Christmas.

30
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:24,986
Oh, aren't you tickled, Arvo?

31
00:03:24,986 --> 00:03:27,399
I mean, with all of the toys made,

32
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:31,165
the only thing left is the delivery.

33
00:03:31,165 --> 00:03:33,108
Of course, Santa will take care of that

34
00:03:33,108 --> 00:03:35,725
and you'll be able to
spend a real Christmas Eve

35
00:03:35,725 --> 00:03:37,946
at home with your family.

36
00:03:37,946 --> 00:03:39,914
- What about you, Mrs. Claus?

37
00:03:39,914 --> 00:03:41,175
Another Christmas Eve alone?

38
00:03:41,175 --> 00:03:45,482
- After the first hundred years
or so, you get used to it.

39
00:03:45,482 --> 00:03:46,513
- [Santa] More mail?

40
00:03:46,513 --> 00:03:47,346
- Nicholas--

41
00:03:47,346 --> 00:03:48,179
- [Elf] That's not all.

42
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:49,179
- More mail.

43
00:03:50,213 --> 00:03:53,732
Well, don't worry, darling,
there are plenty of toys

44
00:03:53,732 --> 00:03:56,767
for these children and much more.

45
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:58,930
Here's your cocoa, dear.

46
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,756
Nicholas, if you have a moment,

47
00:04:00,756 --> 00:04:04,641
there's something that I'd
like you to take a look at.

48
00:04:04,641 --> 00:04:05,844
- Is it me, or are there more children

49
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:08,282
in the world every year?

50
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:09,997
- Well, as it happens, there are,

51
00:04:09,997 --> 00:04:13,355
which is why I was looking
over your navigational maps.

52
00:04:13,355 --> 00:04:15,482
- Yes, yes, sounds very interesting.

53
00:04:15,482 --> 00:04:17,917
- You see, if you change
course here and head off

54
00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:20,039
in an easterly direction--

55
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:22,417
- Oh, Easter is lovely.

56
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:24,301
Course it's no Christmas, but--

57
00:04:24,301 --> 00:04:28,679
- Nick, (chuckles) you haven't
heard a word I've said.

58
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:30,301
- Yes, I have.

59
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:32,613
You wanna serve a new course for Easter.

60
00:04:32,613 --> 00:04:34,775
Bread pudding's always
nice, don't you think?

61
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,403
(Mrs. Claus sighs)

62
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:39,997
- Oh, Nick, I wish you'd let me help you

63
00:04:39,997 --> 00:04:42,637
with the mail this year.

64
00:04:42,637 --> 00:04:45,287
- They write to Santa Claus.

65
00:04:45,287 --> 00:04:48,263
They're gonna have their
letters read by Santa Claus.

66
00:04:48,263 --> 00:04:51,037
Now, call me old fashioned,
but I only know one way

67
00:04:51,037 --> 00:04:53,569
to do this job and that's to do it right.

68
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:55,309
- We're getting behind, chief.

69
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:56,893
I've never seen this much mail.

70
00:04:56,893 --> 00:04:59,098
- But, I haven't made a
dent in the last batch.

71
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,132
(letters clattering)

72
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:00,965
Wait!

73
00:05:02,619 --> 00:05:05,643
- Do you suppose there's a letter in there

74
00:05:05,643 --> 00:05:07,643
addressed to both of us?

75
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:14,726
Oh, didn't think so.

76
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:20,475
Well, at least drink some of your cocoa

77
00:05:20,475 --> 00:05:22,308
while it's still warm.

78
00:05:23,716 --> 00:05:25,527
Oh, it's very chilly in here.

79
00:05:25,527 --> 00:05:29,110
I think someone must've
left a window open.

80
00:05:32,116 --> 00:05:34,660
Oh look!
(dramatic music)

81
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,383
You can see it tonight.

82
00:05:37,383 --> 00:05:39,133
- Oh, the North Star.

83
00:05:40,817 --> 00:05:44,308
Nearly as bright as on Christmas Eve.

84
00:05:44,308 --> 00:05:47,558
- When it guides you safely home to me.

85
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:54,448
Don't want to catch a chill, do we.

86
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,041
(Santa chuckles)

87
00:06:01,947 --> 00:06:05,282
Well, if you don't need me for anything...

88
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,279
- And, there's always the naughty ones

89
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,558
with the bad handwriting.

90
00:06:09,558 --> 00:06:12,308
Hmm, did you say something, Anna?

91
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:16,006
- Oh, no, no, nothing at all.

92
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:28,356
♫ I need something challenging to do

93
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:33,921
♫ Somewhere marvelous to go

94
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:38,397
♫ He's seen every little
corner of the world

95
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:42,147
♫ All I've ever seen is snow

96
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:48,512
♫ I'm Mrs. Santa Claus

97
00:06:48,512 --> 00:06:51,672
♫ The invisible wife

98
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:55,499
♫ And Mrs. Santa Claus needs a change

99
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,647
♫ In her life

100
00:06:57,647 --> 00:06:59,002
♫ I've been manning the business

101
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:03,397
♫ And planning each holiday plan

102
00:07:03,397 --> 00:07:07,564
♫ And I'm tired of being the
shadow behind the great man

103
00:07:09,493 --> 00:07:13,660
♫ For each December when
Santa's checking his list

104
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:19,558
♫ 'Tis the season that he forgets I exist

105
00:07:21,032 --> 00:07:24,072
♫ So the moment has
come to beat my own drum

106
00:07:24,072 --> 00:07:26,259
♫ Because

107
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:30,426
♫ I want the world to know
there's a Mrs. Santa Claus

108
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:35,426
Arvo, hitch up the reindeer, please.

109
00:07:35,426 --> 00:07:36,316
- The reindeer?

110
00:07:36,316 --> 00:07:37,311
- Where are you going?

111
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:39,733
- I'm going to try out this map.

112
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:43,716
I just know that this new
route will save gobs of time.

113
00:07:43,716 --> 00:07:45,376
- Yeah, but what about
the chief (mumbles)?

114
00:07:45,376 --> 00:07:46,540
When are you coming back?

115
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,819
- Well, I'll be back before morning, dear.

116
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:51,370
Just tell him that I've
gone out for a little spin

117
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,787
around the world.

118
00:07:54,352 --> 00:07:56,991
- [Arvo] Please guys, look after her.

119
00:07:56,991 --> 00:07:59,750
♫ I'm Mrs. Santa Claus

120
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,918
♫ Yes, I'm married to him

121
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:07,085
♫ And for centuries I've
been proper and prim

122
00:08:08,557 --> 00:08:10,729
♫ But I'm tired of folding the bedding

123
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:13,262
♫ And spreading the jam

124
00:08:13,262 --> 00:08:14,450
- [Arvo] Oh boy!

125
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:18,617
♫ And I feel I'm about to
begin to find out who I am

126
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:30,476
♫ I've planned my strategy
and my flag is unfurled

127
00:08:31,877 --> 00:08:36,044
♫ For I have gifts of my
own to offer the world

128
00:08:37,781 --> 00:08:39,220
♫ So I'm coming your way

129
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,744
♫ Keep an eye on my sleigh

130
00:08:40,744 --> 00:08:43,013
♫ Because

131
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:47,180
♫ I want the world to know
there's a Mrs. Santa Claus

132
00:08:58,385 --> 00:08:59,726
♫ So I'm coming your way

133
00:08:59,726 --> 00:09:01,301
♫ Keep an eye on my sleigh

134
00:09:01,301 --> 00:09:03,640
♫ Because

135
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,348
♫ You'll have a Merry Christmas with

136
00:09:07,348 --> 00:09:09,265
♫ Mrs.

137
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:12,496
♫ Santa

138
00:09:13,517 --> 00:09:15,517
♫ Claus

139
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:25,566
(reindeer moaning)

140
00:09:26,935 --> 00:09:28,437
Just a little heavy weather.

141
00:09:28,437 --> 00:09:29,437
Steady boys.

142
00:09:31,974 --> 00:09:34,236
(thunder cracking)

143
00:09:34,236 --> 00:09:36,768
We'd better get down on the
ground until this passes.

144
00:09:36,768 --> 00:09:37,685
Gently now.

145
00:09:43,427 --> 00:09:47,594
Oh dear, I thought we were
supposed to be near Stockholm.

146
00:09:49,235 --> 00:09:52,985
Uh, get ready for an
emergency landing, boys.

147
00:09:54,143 --> 00:09:54,976
Easy.

148
00:09:54,976 --> 00:09:56,309
Whoa, whoa boys.

149
00:09:57,705 --> 00:09:58,538
Whoa.

150
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,310
(sleigh screeching)

151
00:10:04,849 --> 00:10:06,272
Well, my goodness.

152
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,310
Are you all right, sweethearts?

153
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,143
(reindeer grumbling)

154
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:12,060
It was a bit unexpected, wasn't it?

155
00:10:14,121 --> 00:10:16,788
(bells chiming)

156
00:10:18,036 --> 00:10:21,361
It's all right, everything
is going to be fine.

157
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:23,150
That's a good boy, Prancer.

158
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,699
You're a very good boy.

159
00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:25,532
(reindeer moaning)

160
00:10:25,532 --> 00:10:27,000
What is it, darling?

161
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,395
Oh, Cupid.

162
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:31,883
Well, we're all safe and sound, aren't we?

163
00:10:31,883 --> 00:10:34,383
Oh, you've hurt your poor leg.

164
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,753
(men chattering)

165
00:10:41,623 --> 00:10:44,790
(Marcello vocalizing)

166
00:10:49,195 --> 00:10:50,476
Lovely singing.

167
00:10:50,476 --> 00:10:52,094
(speaking foreign language)

168
00:10:52,094 --> 00:10:53,538
Good morning.

169
00:10:53,538 --> 00:10:55,396
I wonder if you could help me, dear.

170
00:10:55,396 --> 00:10:57,962
You see, I had a little mishap with my--

171
00:10:57,962 --> 00:10:59,053
- Horse?

172
00:10:59,053 --> 00:11:00,220
- Not exactly.

173
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,159
Come along, Cupid dear.

174
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:05,618
(Cupid moaning)

175
00:11:05,618 --> 00:11:06,451
Yes.

176
00:11:06,451 --> 00:11:07,884
- [Marcello] It's a reindeer.

177
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:09,985
- Yes, a reindeer.

178
00:11:09,985 --> 00:11:12,659
- Oh for a Christmas pageant.

179
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:16,264
- Yes, a Christmas pageant (chuckles).

180
00:11:16,264 --> 00:11:17,097
Quite a big one.

181
00:11:17,097 --> 00:11:18,541
We do it every year.

182
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,374
- Oh.

183
00:11:21,275 --> 00:11:23,162
- Is he very badly hurt?

184
00:11:23,162 --> 00:11:23,995
- Hey.

185
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,581
It's not broken, senora,
but he will need a rest.

186
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:30,797
You leave him here with me?

187
00:11:30,797 --> 00:11:32,300
- Oh, I'd be so grateful.

188
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,173
How soon will he be able to fly?

189
00:11:34,173 --> 00:11:38,170
Uh, that is, how long will
it be before the poor darling

190
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,815
is all healed?

191
00:11:39,815 --> 00:11:42,490
- One week he will be as good as new.

192
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,034
- Oh goodness, one week?

193
00:11:45,034 --> 00:11:47,770
But, I absolutely have to
be home by Christmas Eve

194
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,280
at the very latest.

195
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,960
- [Marcello] Nothing to worry, senora.

196
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,408
I give him extra special care.

197
00:11:53,408 --> 00:11:55,703
- Oh, thank you very much.

198
00:11:55,703 --> 00:11:58,398
I am Marcello Damaroco.

199
00:11:58,398 --> 00:12:00,511
- I'm honored Marcello.

200
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,602
- Where you come from Mrs. uh--

201
00:12:02,602 --> 00:12:06,656
- I come from the North,
uh, from the North.

202
00:12:06,656 --> 00:12:09,021
Ah, Senora de North.

203
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:12,188
- Well, actually, yes, I'm Mrs. North.

204
00:12:14,423 --> 00:12:16,605
Marcello, I don't suppose you have room

205
00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:17,709
for a few more?

206
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:19,101
- More?

207
00:12:19,101 --> 00:12:22,090
- Well, it would be a very
sorry Christmas pageant

208
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,007
with only one reindeer.

209
00:12:27,432 --> 00:12:28,528
Come along, dears.

210
00:12:28,528 --> 00:12:30,774
This is the one we call Blitzen.

211
00:12:30,774 --> 00:12:31,975

00:12:31,975 --> 00:12:32,808
Comet.

213
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:36,703
And, Prancer and Vixen, of course.

214
00:12:36,703 --> 00:12:38,980
- No more, please, senora.

215
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,313
- Oh, just Dasher and Donder and Dancer.

216
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,840
I realize that eight is a lot.

217
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,760
But, they won't be any bother.

218
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,447
I mean, they could double up.

219
00:12:50,447 --> 00:12:54,197
- Well we better get
them some breakfast, no?

220
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,992
Where are you staying, Mrs. North?

221
00:12:58,992 --> 00:13:01,150
- Oh, I hadn't given it a thought.

222
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:04,381
Any old place to unbutton
my boots will do you know.

223

00:14:39,595 --> 00:14:41,322
She's beautiful, no?

249
00:14:41,322 --> 00:14:42,677

00:14:42,677 --> 00:14:43,911
Is she a friend of yours?

251

- Ah, no, no, no.

252
00:14:44,744 --> 00:14:48,189
She speeches to me, but
I never speak to her.

253
00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:51,762
Her mama is the lady I tell
you about who rents the rooms.

254
00:14:51,762 --> 00:14:53,323

257
00:14:57,241 --> 00:14:59,778

Ah, Mr. Kilkenny, one

Enough with the women's suffering.

319
00:20:19,698 --> 00:20:21,369

320
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:22,953
One man, one vote.

321
00:20:22,953 --> 00:20:25,065
The law says nothing about women.

322
00:20:25,065 --> 00:20:27,020
- (chuckles) Excuse my daughter.

323
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,569
She's a little excitable.

I come to listen to you every day.

- To my speeches?

331
00:20:45,689 --> 00:20:49,456
- To you is speech,
signorina, to me is a song.

332
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,565
If I could, I would give my vote to you.

You raising the devil out here.

338
00:20:58,538 --> 00:20:59,371
Get inside.

339
00:20:59,371 --> 00:21:01,261
- I'll go, I'll go.

340
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:02,761
Just let go of me.

341
00:21:04,588 --> 00:21:05,421

You wait and see, but I'll be speaking

345
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:09,511

346
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:13,301
- Come, you shouldn't freeze out here.

347
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:17,468
- Oh, where I come from, this
is picnic weather (laughs).

348
00:21:21,762 --> 00:21:23,877
Oh, I'm afraid I can't take

349
00:21:23,877 --> 00:21:25,471
one of your rooms, Mrs. Lowenstein.

350
00:21:25,471 --> 00:21:27,653
You see, I have no money.

351
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,359
- A fine lady like you?

352
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:30,690
You'll get a job.

353
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,239
You'll pay me when you can.

354
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:33,072
Come.

00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,752
♫ So, a lady from a cold and distant place

361
00:21:57,752 --> 00:22:01,164
♫ A lifetime away

362
00:22:01,164 --> 00:22:05,331
♫ Still can become part of the world

363
00:22:06,732 --> 00:22:09,232
♫ Of Avenue A

364
00:22:18,517 --> 00:22:22,069
(lively music)
(pedestrians chattering)

365
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:24,060
- And, this is the parlor.

366
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,116
(Mrs. Claus chuckles)

367
00:22:25,116 --> 00:22:28,453
I take in a little sewing
on the side, as you can see.

368
00:22:28,453 --> 00:22:31,189
You want something mended, you just ask.

369
00:22:31,189 --> 00:22:34,031
- Well, I'm afraid I only
have the clothes on my back.

370
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:35,400
- (gasps) Oh!

371
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,560
Well, I know a ladies emporium.

372
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,597
Gorgeous second-hand
clothes, on credit yet.

373
00:22:40,597 --> 00:22:42,204
(women giggling)

374
00:22:42,204 --> 00:22:45,902
- Well don't tell me that you made this!

375
00:22:45,902 --> 00:22:49,080
- For my fancy customer, from uptown.

376
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,913
Let me.

377
00:22:49,913 --> 00:22:51,711
- Oh thank you.

378
00:22:51,711 --> 00:22:53,878
- Dinner, I serve at 6:00.

379
00:22:55,612 --> 00:22:57,877
Extra five cents a day should you want.

380
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,989
- Oh thank you, I want.

381
00:22:59,989 --> 00:23:01,407
(light knocking)

382
00:23:01,407 --> 00:23:02,407
- Excuse me.

383
00:23:07,022 --> 00:23:09,628
- Where's that little
hellion, Nora Kilkenny?

384
00:23:09,628 --> 00:23:11,029
Is her father at home?

385
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:13,276
- No, no, not here.

386
00:23:13,276 --> 00:23:15,300
On the trolley car he's working.

387
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,488
Day and night.

388
00:23:16,488 --> 00:23:18,636
- Well, you tell him for
me that his little hooligan

389
00:23:18,636 --> 00:23:20,738
has been raising holy hellfire.

390
00:23:20,738 --> 00:23:23,308
Excuse the language, missus and missus.

391
00:23:23,308 --> 00:23:27,141
- I'll tell him sir,
officer, Your Honor, sir.

392
00:23:35,382 --> 00:23:38,225
- Oh, Mrs. Lowenstein, you're shaking.

393
00:23:38,225 --> 00:23:40,687
- I think he's coming to take away Sadie.

394
00:23:40,687 --> 00:23:42,739
She makes such trouble.

395
00:23:42,739 --> 00:23:46,391
- Oh, just for speaking on the sidewalk?

396
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:49,844
- I have seen what comes
from this in the old country.

397
00:23:49,844 --> 00:23:53,011
(somber violin music)

398
00:23:56,508 --> 00:23:58,841
This bag in the closet, this

399
00:24:02,556 --> 00:24:05,139
I always keep packed and ready.

400
00:24:06,058 --> 00:24:08,424
A candlestick from my grandmother,

401
00:24:08,424 --> 00:24:12,383
pictures of my husband,
may he rest in peace.

402
00:24:12,383 --> 00:24:14,543
He didn't live to see America.

403
00:24:14,543 --> 00:24:16,943
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

404
00:24:16,943 --> 00:24:19,055
- And, at the rate my Sadie is going,

405
00:24:19,055 --> 00:24:21,692
they could throw out tomorrow.

406
00:24:21,692 --> 00:24:24,359
So, always the bag stays packed.

407
00:24:29,394 --> 00:24:31,893
- Women of the world, unite!

408
00:24:31,893 --> 00:24:34,184
A revolution is at hand.

409
00:24:34,184 --> 00:24:37,434
And, when we take our rightful place...

410
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:39,649
Well, some day.

411
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,567
You'll see.

412
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,550
Everyone will see.

413
00:24:46,847 --> 00:24:48,728
- Here, beautiful miss.

414
00:24:48,728 --> 00:24:50,914
Please, let me help you down.

415
00:24:50,914 --> 00:24:52,280
- It may surprise you to know that a woman

416
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,239
is perfectly capable of taking a step

417
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:55,989
without a man's help.

418
00:24:57,887 --> 00:24:59,137
But, thank you.

419
00:25:00,993 --> 00:25:03,011
- My pleasure, signorina.

420
00:25:03,011 --> 00:25:07,115
♫ In the middle the slush, the noise

421
00:25:07,115 --> 00:25:11,032
♫ The teeming grind of the day

422
00:25:13,392 --> 00:25:17,559
♫ Look how a lovely rose can bloom

423
00:25:18,937 --> 00:25:21,437
♫ On Avenue A

424
00:25:33,863 --> 00:25:38,150
- Now, tonight latkas
I'm making for Hanukkah.

425
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,221
Oh yes, Hanukkah.

426
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:41,689
- Hanukkah.

427
00:25:41,689 --> 00:25:43,285
While you're having Christmas.

428
00:25:43,285 --> 00:25:45,452
So, we're having Hanukkah.

429
00:25:47,248 --> 00:25:49,443
So, what happened to all my eggs?

430
00:25:49,443 --> 00:25:50,320
Ush!

431
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,488
Now, I have to go out and get.

432
00:25:52,488 --> 00:25:55,011
- So, you don't celebrate Christmas.

433
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:55,844
- No.

434
00:25:56,953 --> 00:26:00,902
But, between you and me, I'm
enjoying it more than I should.

435
00:26:00,902 --> 00:26:02,148
(women giggling)

436
00:26:02,148 --> 00:26:04,815
(Nora coughing)

437
00:26:17,491 --> 00:26:18,824
- Officer Doyle.

438
00:26:20,185 --> 00:26:22,018
- Oh, Mrs. Lowenstein.

439
00:26:23,975 --> 00:26:24,975
Well, hello.

440
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:27,352
- Hello.

441
00:26:28,727 --> 00:26:30,432
- Well, you darling girl.

442
00:26:30,432 --> 00:26:31,969
You found the eggs that Mrs. Lowenstein

443
00:26:31,969 --> 00:26:33,422
was looking for.

444
00:26:33,422 --> 00:26:35,362
- I seen you, you little brat.

445
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:37,279
By God, I have you now.

446
00:26:38,321 --> 00:26:39,904
- Oh cripes, Doyle!

447
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,583
- In here.

448
00:26:48,257 --> 00:26:50,924
(loud knocking)

449
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:56,470
- Uh, where is she?

450
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,478
The girl?

451
00:26:57,478 --> 00:27:00,822
- Oh, did I hear little
footsteps going out the back way?

452
00:27:00,822 --> 00:27:03,072
- Thanks very much, missus.

453
00:27:05,686 --> 00:27:06,682
(light knocking)

454
00:27:06,682 --> 00:27:08,765
- [Mrs. Claus] All clear.

455
00:27:09,603 --> 00:27:12,450
- Hey, why did you do that?

456
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:16,964
- It so happens that I
like children very much.

457
00:27:16,964 --> 00:27:18,981
- You living here?

458
00:27:18,981 --> 00:27:20,324
- For awhile.

459
00:27:20,324 --> 00:27:21,345
- Me too.

460
00:27:21,345 --> 00:27:22,318
I'm Nora.

461
00:27:22,318 --> 00:27:24,058
- Oh, I'm Mrs. North.

462
00:27:24,058 --> 00:27:26,347
Mmm, and where is your mother?

463
00:27:26,347 --> 00:27:27,886
- She's back in Ireland.

464
00:27:27,886 --> 00:27:29,339
My old man's working double shifts

465
00:27:29,339 --> 00:27:31,327
to pay for a steamship ticket to bring her

466
00:27:31,327 --> 00:27:33,477
and my baby brother over.

467
00:27:33,477 --> 00:27:36,622
- So, your mother is in
Ireland and your father

468
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:38,494
is working all the time.

469
00:27:38,494 --> 00:27:40,677
- Hey, I pull my own weight.

470
00:27:40,677 --> 00:27:43,784
I got me a job over at Tavish's.

471
00:27:43,784 --> 00:27:45,581
- You have a job?

472
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,445
- Well, why shouldn't I?

473
00:27:47,445 --> 00:27:49,041
Don't you?

474
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:50,539
- At the moment, no.

475
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:52,853
Uh, but I do need one.

476
00:27:52,853 --> 00:27:56,168
- All right, you did for me
so I'll do for you, kiddo.

477
00:27:56,168 --> 00:27:57,464
- Kiddo?

478
00:27:57,464 --> 00:27:58,760
- That's New York talk.

479
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,649
- Oh.

480
00:27:59,649 --> 00:28:02,948
- I don't suppose you'd know
anything about making toys?

481
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:03,781
- Oh.

482
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,967
(comical music)

483
00:28:18,091 --> 00:28:21,848
♫ The red balloons may stain your ceiling

484
00:28:21,848 --> 00:28:26,155
♫ And the fire engine's paint is peeling

485

♫ So when you're low

495

♫ So the teddy bear
has popped its stitches

501
00:29:22,452 --> 00:29:26,813

00:29:45,861 --> 00:29:47,244
♫ Rather unusual

512
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:49,577
♫ Tavis Toy

Ah, here she is now.

515
00:30:02,348 --> 00:30:03,400
Workers.

516
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,233
(cane tapping)

517
00:30:04,233 --> 00:30:07,109
Allow me to present Mrs. North,

518
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:09,535
your new supervisor.

519
00:30:09,535 --> 00:30:13,702
Welcome, welcome to the
wonderful world of Tavish Toys.

520
00:30:14,828 --> 00:30:16,711
We're so lucky to have found someone

521
00:30:16,711 --> 00:30:20,695
with Mrs. North's experience
and on such short notice.

522
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:21,528
- Uh, yes.

523
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:24,970
Well, it certainly
looks as if I'll have to

524
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:27,155
roll up my sleeves a bit.

525
00:30:27,155 --> 00:30:31,884
- (chuckles) Well, I shall
leave you to your own devices.

526
00:30:31,884 --> 00:30:36,051
Just keep in mind, time is
of the essence, tick, tock.

527
00:30:38,513 --> 00:30:41,626
- Well, I'm certainly used
to the Christmas rush.

528
00:30:41,626 --> 00:30:43,543
- [Tavish] Outstanding.

529
00:30:45,685 --> 00:30:48,671
- Now, my little elves,
I do not want a repeat

530
00:30:48,671 --> 00:30:52,421
of what happened to the
last supervisor, hmm?

531
00:30:54,178 --> 00:30:56,261
(laughs)

532
00:31:01,298 --> 00:31:02,697
- Well, hello.

533
00:31:02,697 --> 00:31:05,893
You're awfully small to
be using such a big broom.

534
00:31:05,893 --> 00:31:06,798
- That's Emilio.

535
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,094
He don't talk.

536
00:31:08,094 --> 00:31:10,062
He's new in America.

537
00:31:10,062 --> 00:31:12,654
- I know just how he feels.

538
00:31:12,654 --> 00:31:16,709
Now, if I might ask, what
happened to the other supervisor?

539
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:18,857
I was told that he was taken ill.

540
00:31:18,857 --> 00:31:20,369
- Yeah, he tripped over something.

541
00:31:20,369 --> 00:31:21,953
- Yeah, your foot.

542
00:31:21,953 --> 00:31:22,865
(children laughing)

543
00:31:22,865 --> 00:31:25,829
- Hey, Mrs. North is all right.

544
00:31:25,829 --> 00:31:27,377
She's my friend.

545
00:31:27,377 --> 00:31:29,790
- If she's your friend, tell
her to get us some heat.

546
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:32,251
- Yes, it is a bit
frosty in here, isn't it?

547
00:31:32,251 --> 00:31:34,673
There must be some kind of
malfunction with the stove.

548
00:31:34,673 --> 00:31:35,912
- [Child] Yeah, it don't function

549
00:31:35,912 --> 00:31:37,937
till Tavish puts some coal in it.

550
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,991
- Well, I'll have to speak to Mr. Tavish

551
00:31:39,991 --> 00:31:42,074
about that, won't I?

552
00:31:42,074 --> 00:31:45,029
I've always felt that a happy workshop

553
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:47,360
is a productive workshop.

554
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,525
Don't you agree?

555
00:31:48,525 --> 00:31:50,637
- Have you ever worked in
a factory before, lady?

556
00:31:50,637 --> 00:31:52,147
- [Girl] Tell her, Fritzie, tell her.

557
00:31:52,147 --> 00:31:53,388
- Well, it so happens that we're

558
00:31:53,388 --> 00:31:55,946
in the toy business ourselves back home.

559
00:31:55,946 --> 00:31:56,779
- Get her.

560
00:31:56,779 --> 00:31:58,141
What's an old lady know about toys?

561
00:31:58,141 --> 00:31:59,114
(children laughing)

562
00:31:59,114 --> 00:32:00,708
- Old lady?

563
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:04,100
Certainly, you're not referring to me.

564
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,267
♫ I'm holding back the hands of time

565
00:32:09,114 --> 00:32:11,549
♫ And though a fool might say

566
00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:13,177
♫ I passed my prime

567
00:32:13,177 --> 00:32:17,575
♫ My heart has always clung

568
00:32:17,575 --> 00:32:21,075
♫ To staying almost young

569
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:26,277
♫ A few gray hairs, a few gold teeth

570
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:30,276
♫ Can never hide the kid that's underneath

571
00:32:30,276 --> 00:32:34,700
♫ A kid whose hopes are hung

572
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,200
♫ On staying almost young

573
00:32:39,464 --> 00:32:43,062
♫ My walk is swift and sporty

574
00:32:43,062 --> 00:32:46,895
♫ My disposition is evergreen

575
00:32:47,837 --> 00:32:51,527
♫ Why say I'm over 40

576
00:32:51,527 --> 00:32:54,027
♫ I'm over 17

577
00:32:55,737 --> 00:32:59,860
♫ I'll still have all the speed it takes

578
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:03,985
♫ When all the others
have applied the brakes

579
00:33:03,985 --> 00:33:08,327
♫ And when my knell has rung

580
00:33:08,327 --> 00:33:09,809
♫ I'll still be struttin' and kickin'

581
00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:10,882
♫ Like some little chicken

582
00:33:10,882 --> 00:33:14,095
♫ I'm almost young

583
00:33:14,095 --> 00:33:15,322
- I hope you're almost finished.

584
00:33:15,322 --> 00:33:17,235
- Not a chance, kiddo.

585
00:33:17,235 --> 00:33:20,785
♫ So if you think this spunky pup

586
00:33:20,785 --> 00:33:25,035
♫ Is either boggin' down or slowin' up

587
00:33:25,035 --> 00:33:29,285
♫ You'd better hold your tongue

588
00:33:29,285 --> 00:33:32,868
♫ I'm feeling almost young

589
00:33:37,089 --> 00:33:40,089
(children laughing)

590
00:33:57,715 --> 00:33:59,132
- See, I told ya.

591
00:34:07,815 --> 00:34:11,242
♫ My bones are often racked up

592
00:34:11,242 --> 00:34:13,376
♫ They always act up

593
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,542
♫ Each time it rains

594
00:34:15,542 --> 00:34:19,601
♫ But my arthritis and my phlebitis

595
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:23,184
♫ Are simply growing pains

596
00:34:24,115 --> 00:34:28,360
♫ So let them say I passed my peak

597
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:32,560
♫ That I'm a million
years from hide-and-seek

598
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,695
♫ But when my dirge is sung

599
00:34:36,695 --> 00:34:39,323
♫ I'll still be tough as a
riddle and fit as a fiddle

600
00:34:39,323 --> 00:34:41,423
♫ And struttin' and kickin'
like some little chicken

601
00:34:41,423 --> 00:34:43,840
♫ And almost

602
00:34:45,723 --> 00:34:48,056
- [Boy] Come on, Mrs. North.

603
00:34:49,013 --> 00:34:49,846
♫ Young

604
00:34:49,846 --> 00:34:52,684
(children cheering)

605
00:34:52,684 --> 00:34:56,048
(children giggling)

606
00:34:56,048 --> 00:34:59,268
- Happy workers, that's what I like.

607
00:34:59,268 --> 00:35:01,268
Grateful, happy workers.

608
00:35:03,923 --> 00:35:06,999
- Yes, but, there are
some problems, Mr. Tavish.

609
00:35:06,999 --> 00:35:09,209
I mean, the heat, for instance.

610
00:35:09,209 --> 00:35:10,042
- Heat?

611
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:11,865
I don't feel any heat, do you?

612
00:35:11,865 --> 00:35:14,790
- Oh, and there's a matter of quality.

613
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:17,748
Mr. Tavish, have you ever seen how a child

614
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,670
plays with a teddy bear?

615
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,073
- What's your point, Mrs. North?

616
00:35:21,073 --> 00:35:23,213
- Well, give this bear a hug
and you'll see what I mean.

617
00:35:23,213 --> 00:35:24,046
- Um, no.

618
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,419
- Oh just a little hug.

619
00:35:27,419 --> 00:35:30,328
- Get that bear away from me.

620
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:33,655
- Well then, I'll show you myself.

621
00:35:33,655 --> 00:35:38,301
This is how a child hugs
a teddy bear, Mr. Tavish.

622
00:35:38,301 --> 00:35:40,313
There, you see what I mean?

623
00:35:40,313 --> 00:35:42,913
I mean, what's needed
here is thicker cloth

624
00:35:42,913 --> 00:35:43,925
for the fur.

625
00:35:43,925 --> 00:35:46,499
And, good, strong thread.

626
00:35:46,499 --> 00:35:48,927
- You worry too much, Mrs. North.

627
00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:51,682
You look at the bear and see the flaws.

628
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:55,435
I look at it and see
the happiness it brings.

629
00:35:55,435 --> 00:35:57,400
- Oh, but I don't think that defective toy

630
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,587
makes any child happy, Mr. Tavish.

631
00:35:59,587 --> 00:36:02,252
- I was referring to the
happiness it brings to me.

632
00:36:02,252 --> 00:36:05,806
The more we make, the more
we sell, the happier I am.

633
00:36:05,806 --> 00:36:08,762
Tick, tock, Mrs. North, tick, tock.

634
00:36:08,762 --> 00:36:12,074
- Mr. Tavish, if you've
ever see a child's face

635
00:36:12,074 --> 00:36:13,651
when a toy breaks.

636
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:16,214
- Workers, what's our motto?

637
00:36:16,214 --> 00:36:19,735
- [Children] It only has
to last till Christmas.

638
00:36:19,735 --> 00:36:21,103
- Oh, but Mr. Tavish.

639
00:36:21,103 --> 00:36:24,013
The children's hands are
shaking with the cold.

640
00:36:24,013 --> 00:36:25,930
Can't anything be done?

641
00:36:26,946 --> 00:36:30,566
- Of course something
can be done, Mrs. North.

642
00:36:30,566 --> 00:36:31,399
Mittens.

643
00:36:35,142 --> 00:36:38,059
- But, Mr. Tavish, Mr. Tavish, sir.

644
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,947
Auggie Tavish.

645
00:36:45,606 --> 00:36:50,509
Children, the conditions
in here are intolerable.

646
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:52,002
- So, what are you gonna do about it?

647
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:55,017
- Well, I haven't decided just yet,

648
00:36:55,017 --> 00:36:57,017
but when I do, I do know

649
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:00,987
that we all have to stick together.

650
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,386
What do you say?

651
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:12,021
(children cheering)

652
00:37:12,909 --> 00:37:16,828
♫ So let them say you passed my peak

653
00:37:16,828 --> 00:37:20,861
♫ That you're a million
years from hide-and-seek

654
00:37:20,861 --> 00:37:25,246
♫ But when my dirge is sung

655
00:37:25,246 --> 00:37:27,881
♫ You'll still be tough as
a riddle and fit as a fiddle

656
00:37:27,881 --> 00:37:29,951
♫ And struttin' and kickin'
like some little chicken

657
00:37:29,951 --> 00:37:32,868
♫ And almost young

658
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:40,080
(children cheering)

659
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,830
(delicate music)

660
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:53,791
- Here we go.

661
00:37:55,176 --> 00:37:56,093
Piping hot.

662
00:37:57,496 --> 00:37:58,996
- Thank you, Arvo.

663
00:38:04,498 --> 00:38:05,331
Rrruck!

664
00:38:06,424 --> 00:38:07,691
My wife made this cocoa?

665
00:38:07,691 --> 00:38:10,036
- Uh (chuckles) looks like
nice is beating naughty

666
00:38:10,036 --> 00:38:12,029
'bout 100 to one this year.

667
00:38:12,029 --> 00:38:13,154
- Arvo, I asked you a question.

668
00:38:13,154 --> 00:38:14,317
Who made the cocoa?

669
00:38:14,317 --> 00:38:16,571
- I made the cocoa.

670
00:38:16,571 --> 00:38:17,616
I'm a supervisor.

671
00:38:17,616 --> 00:38:19,202
I'm not a cocoa elf.

672
00:38:19,202 --> 00:38:21,827
- Why didn't Mrs. Claus make it?

673
00:38:21,827 --> 00:38:26,105
Arvo, I repeat, why
didn't Mrs. Claus make it?

674
00:38:26,105 --> 00:38:29,022
- Uh, Mrs. Claus isn't here, chief.

675
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:31,129
- Isn't here?

676
00:38:31,129 --> 00:38:33,262
That's impossible.

677
00:38:33,262 --> 00:38:34,845
Where would she be?

678
00:38:37,669 --> 00:38:40,974
- Uh, well, she said to uh, tell you, that

679
00:38:40,974 --> 00:38:43,844
she's taking a little trip.

680
00:38:43,844 --> 00:38:46,019
Around the world.

681
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:48,024
- Arvo, why didn't she tell me?

682
00:38:48,024 --> 00:38:48,975
I would've stopped her.

683
00:38:48,975 --> 00:38:50,769
- Maybe that's what she didn't tell you.

684
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:51,836
- Well, why didn't you tell me, Arvo?

685
00:38:51,836 --> 00:38:53,871
- I've been expecting
her back any minute now

686
00:38:53,871 --> 00:38:55,140
and I didn't want you to worry.

687
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,458
Besides, you didn't even
notice she was gone.

688
00:38:58,458 --> 00:38:59,584
- Well I wa...

689
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,167
Well certainly I...

690
00:39:02,126 --> 00:39:03,425
Well she hasn't been gone--

691
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:04,342
- Two days.

692
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,293
- That's not possible.

693
00:39:09,176 --> 00:39:10,820
Surely I would've...

694
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,626
- Look, if you had taken
notice of her now and then,

695
00:39:13,626 --> 00:39:15,405
maybe she wouldn't have left.

696
00:39:15,405 --> 00:39:17,534
- Where on Earth can she be?

697
00:39:17,534 --> 00:39:19,388
In a few days it'll be Christmas.

698
00:39:19,388 --> 00:39:20,376
- Well, if she's not back soon,

699
00:39:20,376 --> 00:39:23,415
we may not even have Christmas.

700
00:39:23,415 --> 00:39:25,248
She took the reindeer.

701
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:32,766
- Can't bear to think of
her out there, somewhere,

702
00:39:33,798 --> 00:39:36,120
helpless and alone.

703
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,579
- [Santa] Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas.

704
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:41,584
Thank you, young man.

705
00:39:41,584 --> 00:39:42,966
- A very worthy cause, dear.

706
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:46,483
But, the boots aren't quite right.

707
00:39:46,483 --> 00:39:47,957
(lively music)

708
00:39:47,957 --> 00:39:51,207
(trolley bell ringing)

709
00:39:53,162 --> 00:39:55,412
Good morning, Mr. Kilkenny.

710
00:40:03,054 --> 00:40:05,023
- It is time for change.

711
00:40:05,023 --> 00:40:08,206
We have the right to demand the vote.

712
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:10,287
Look at Susan B. Anthony.

713
00:40:10,287 --> 00:40:11,877
Look how one woman has taken up--

714
00:40:11,877 --> 00:40:14,177
(speaking foreign language)

715
00:40:14,177 --> 00:40:16,431
Oh, nice and crunchy (giggles).

716
00:40:16,431 --> 00:40:17,983
Just like the boys like them.

717
00:40:17,983 --> 00:40:20,893
I wonder, would you be a dear
and send over eight bunches

718
00:40:20,893 --> 00:40:22,905
of these to the Delancey stables?

719
00:40:22,905 --> 00:40:24,962
And, some of these lovely apples, too.

720
00:40:24,962 --> 00:40:27,480
I think 20 pounds should do it.

721
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,139
And, tell Marcello that
Mrs. North sent them.

722
00:40:30,139 --> 00:40:31,427
He'll know what to do.

723
00:40:31,427 --> 00:40:32,926
- [Man] Marcello, Delancey Stables.

724
00:40:32,926 --> 00:40:33,759
- Mrs. North.

725
00:40:33,759 --> 00:40:35,115
(speaking foreign language)

726
00:40:35,115 --> 00:40:38,752
- The workers were not afraid
to speak up for their rights.

727
00:40:38,752 --> 00:40:41,193
And, when the bosses wouldn't
give him a better wage,

728
00:40:41,193 --> 00:40:43,379
the workers demanded it.

729
00:40:43,379 --> 00:40:45,563
And, the right to vote will not be granted

730
00:40:45,563 --> 00:40:48,163
until women demand it.

731
00:40:48,163 --> 00:40:51,095
- I demand some hot water.

732
00:40:51,095 --> 00:40:54,235
Why don't you holler
on my landlord, Sadie?

733
00:40:54,235 --> 00:40:58,191
- Who will march with me to Union Square?

734
00:40:58,191 --> 00:40:59,363
It's hopeless.

735
00:40:59,363 --> 00:41:02,595
All these women care about is
the price of pushcart onions.

736
00:41:02,595 --> 00:41:04,088
- I know.

737
00:41:04,088 --> 00:41:06,204
You know, Sadie, I'm in
a bit of a predicament

738
00:41:06,204 --> 00:41:07,952
and I think you might be just the person

739
00:41:07,952 --> 00:41:09,170
to help me.

740
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:10,003
- [Sadie] Really?

741
00:41:10,003 --> 00:41:13,761
- Now, try to imagine a group of workers

742
00:41:13,761 --> 00:41:16,223
in a factory, let's say.

743
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:20,475
Now, how might they improve
their working conditions?

744
00:41:20,475 --> 00:41:24,353
Keeping in mind that the boss
is a rather difficult man.

745
00:41:24,353 --> 00:41:28,520
Not inclined to give in to
demands, if you know what I mean.

746
00:41:30,195 --> 00:41:32,311
- And, that's all you have to do.

747
00:41:32,311 --> 00:41:34,163
- It's really that simple?

748
00:41:34,163 --> 00:41:35,749
- Oh, it's been successful in factories

749
00:41:35,749 --> 00:41:37,499
all over the country.

750
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:41,038
I wish the other women
around here would listen

751
00:41:41,038 --> 00:41:43,213
to me the way you do.

752
00:41:43,213 --> 00:41:44,630
I promised I'd...

753
00:41:48,044 --> 00:41:49,871
- You're a good influence, Mrs. North,

754
00:41:49,871 --> 00:41:52,062
keeping my Sadie out of trouble.

755
00:41:52,062 --> 00:41:54,312
(chuckles)

756
00:41:55,609 --> 00:41:57,944
- I promised that I'd
bring a whole contingent

757
00:41:57,944 --> 00:42:00,360
from Avenue A to the rally tomorrow.

758
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,019
Instead, I'm just bringing a soapbox.

759
00:42:03,019 --> 00:42:06,273
- Well, if you wouldn't
mind a little advice

760
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:08,742
from a Johnny-come-lately like me?

761
00:42:08,742 --> 00:42:10,216
- No, please.

762
00:42:10,216 --> 00:42:13,449
I so admire your fervor, Sadie.

763
00:42:13,449 --> 00:42:17,852
But, I don't believe anyone
likes to be shouted at.

764
00:42:17,852 --> 00:42:21,864
- Well, I shout so my
message can be heard.

765
00:42:21,864 --> 00:42:25,531
- Perhaps if you try
talking to these ladies

766
00:42:26,881 --> 00:42:28,631
without your soapbox.

767
00:42:38,175 --> 00:42:39,692
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Shaughnessy.

768
00:42:39,692 --> 00:42:42,661
- Well, if it isn't Soapbox Sadie.

769
00:42:42,661 --> 00:42:44,422
I'll have none of your blarney now.

770
00:42:44,422 --> 00:42:45,673
Good day to you, Mrs. North.

771
00:42:45,673 --> 00:42:47,340
- And, to you, Mrs. Shaughnessy.

772
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,801
You know, Sadie was just telling me

773
00:42:48,801 --> 00:42:51,837
how you came all the way
over here from Ireland

774
00:42:51,837 --> 00:42:54,115
when you were just a girl.

775
00:42:54,115 --> 00:42:57,460
- My own mother brought
10 of us over from Dublin.

776
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:00,614
- Oh, did you say Dublin,
on the River Liffey.

777
00:43:00,614 --> 00:43:02,187
- Bless my soul.

778
00:43:02,187 --> 00:43:03,935
You know Dublin, Mrs. North?

779
00:43:03,935 --> 00:43:06,852
- Well, I'm very keen on geography.

780
00:43:07,775 --> 00:43:10,065
- Now, Mrs. Shaughnessy,
there must've been some

781
00:43:10,065 --> 00:43:12,123
who told your mother to stay put.

782
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:14,331
- Oh well, there were many that tried.

783
00:43:14,331 --> 00:43:16,701
But, you don't know my mother.

784
00:43:16,701 --> 00:43:19,077
- But, are you very many
of the women like her?

785
00:43:19,077 --> 00:43:20,063
You for example.

786
00:43:20,063 --> 00:43:21,167
- That's why we're asking you

787
00:43:21,167 --> 00:43:23,200
to stand strong, Mrs. Shaughnessy.

788
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,445
- Just like your mother.

789
00:43:24,445 --> 00:43:25,656
- And, march with us.

790
00:43:25,656 --> 00:43:28,447
- [Mrs. Claus And Sadie]
For a woman's right to vote.

791
00:43:28,447 --> 00:43:31,253
(stick thudding)

792
00:43:31,253 --> 00:43:33,516
- Mr. Brandenheim makes all the decisions.

793
00:43:33,516 --> 00:43:35,208
What do I need the vote for?

794
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:37,186
- But, Mrs. Brandenheim, you yourself

795
00:43:37,186 --> 00:43:39,532
make 100 decisions every day.

796
00:43:39,532 --> 00:43:42,844
Don't you decide what you make for dinner?

797
00:43:42,844 --> 00:43:44,258
- Yah, I do that.

798
00:43:44,258 --> 00:43:46,647
- And, don't you decide
how much coal to buy?

799
00:43:46,647 --> 00:43:48,180
- Yah, I do that.

800
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:51,169
- And, how many nickels
to put in the cookie jar?

801
00:43:51,169 --> 00:43:53,495
- Yah, I do that too.

802
00:43:53,495 --> 00:43:56,678
- So, shouldn't you
decide who gets elected?

803
00:43:56,678 --> 00:43:57,511
- Yah!

804
00:43:58,438 --> 00:44:00,816
Oh, all this deciding.

805
00:44:00,816 --> 00:44:02,149
It wears me out.

806
00:44:05,108 --> 00:44:06,292
- [Sadie] Oh well, I guess it's only

807
00:44:06,292 --> 00:44:08,019
the two of us after all.

808
00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:11,602
- Still I'm proud to
march with you, Sadie.

809
00:44:14,794 --> 00:44:18,961
♫ I'm Mrs. Shaughnessy
and I'm marching with you

810
00:44:20,036 --> 00:44:24,203
♫ I'm Mrs. Brandenheim
and I'm joining you too.

811
00:44:25,118 --> 00:44:27,638
♫ It's time to stand up,
step out, and be counted

812
00:44:27,638 --> 00:44:30,318
♫ And then

813
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:34,485
♫ How about tying an
apron on all of the men

814
00:44:35,836 --> 00:44:37,612
- Vote for women!

815
00:44:37,612 --> 00:44:42,604
♫ Now, Mr. Brandenheim
thinks how clever he is

816
00:44:42,604 --> 00:44:46,771
♫ But, this old girl has a
brain that's equal to his

817
00:44:47,659 --> 00:44:48,827
♫ So, remember our call

818
00:44:48,827 --> 00:44:52,092
♫ A line that you all can quote

819
00:44:52,092 --> 00:44:56,813
♫ It's time for every miss
and missus to have a vote

820
00:44:56,813 --> 00:44:57,720
- But, beyond the vote.

821
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,894
I mean, men must acknowledge what we do

822
00:45:00,894 --> 00:45:03,327
in little ways every day.

823
00:45:03,327 --> 00:45:05,043
- Mrs. North, wait for me.

824
00:45:05,043 --> 00:45:07,317
- Oh yes, come along, Nora.

825
00:45:07,317 --> 00:45:08,704
Isn't it marvelous what happens

826
00:45:08,704 --> 00:45:11,113
when people speak up for themselves.

827
00:45:11,113 --> 00:45:12,458
And, you know what, Nora?

828
00:45:12,458 --> 00:45:13,291
- [Nora] What?

829
00:45:13,291 --> 00:45:15,707
- That's what's going to
happen at Tavish Toys.

830
00:45:15,707 --> 00:45:17,555
Now Sadie was telling me
about something called

831
00:45:17,555 --> 00:45:18,888
a work slowdown.

832
00:45:20,102 --> 00:45:21,628
I think it just might do the trick.

833
00:45:21,628 --> 00:45:22,751
- [Nora] We'll get heat?

834
00:45:22,751 --> 00:45:24,724
- Only if we stick together, Sadie set.

835
00:45:24,724 --> 00:45:26,478
- I'm with you, Mrs. North.

836
00:45:26,478 --> 00:45:27,975
- Oh Marcello, thank goodness.

837
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,159
I'm on pins and needles
about getting home.

838
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:32,015
Tell me, how is Cupid?

839
00:45:32,015 --> 00:45:33,421
- What are you doing here, Marcello?

840
00:45:33,421 --> 00:45:35,072
- I want for you having a vote, signorina

841
00:45:35,072 --> 00:45:36,121
and all that your heart desires.

842
00:45:36,121 --> 00:45:36,954
- [Santa] Ho, ho, ho.

843
00:45:36,954 --> 00:45:38,287
Merry Christmas.

844
00:45:39,613 --> 00:45:40,886
Ho, ho, ho.

845
00:45:40,886 --> 00:45:43,396
- We mustn't catch cold, must we dear.

846
00:45:43,396 --> 00:45:44,914
- Thank you.

847
00:45:44,914 --> 00:45:46,890
- Wait for me.

848
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:48,308
I'm coming.

849
00:45:48,308 --> 00:45:51,058
(women shouting)

850
00:45:53,338 --> 00:45:58,254
♫ We planned our strategy
and our flag is unfurled

851
00:45:58,254 --> 00:46:02,421
♫ For we have gifts of
our own to offer the world

852
00:46:03,284 --> 00:46:04,453
♫ So, remember our call

853
00:46:04,453 --> 00:46:07,741
♫ A line you all can quote

854
00:46:07,741 --> 00:46:11,750
♫ It's time for every miss and missus

855
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:14,500
♫ To have a vote

856
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:27,170
(gentle music)

857
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:28,806
- How are we doing, sweetheart?

858
00:46:28,806 --> 00:46:30,262
(reindeer grunting)

859
00:46:30,262 --> 00:46:32,422
Oh, I know, I know.

860
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:35,355
Oh, I imagine that Santa
is terribly worried

861
00:46:35,355 --> 00:46:36,970
about us by now.

862
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:39,573
And, that's why you've got to
stay off that leg, darling.

863
00:46:39,573 --> 00:46:41,138
Give it a chance to heal.

864
00:46:41,138 --> 00:46:42,530
There's a sweetheart.

865
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:43,613
(reindeer grunting)

866
00:46:43,613 --> 00:46:48,018
I know, I know, Christmas
Eve is fast approaching.

867
00:46:48,018 --> 00:46:49,851
Only three days until.

868
00:46:55,123 --> 00:46:56,454
- There she is.

869
00:46:56,454 --> 00:46:57,537
Brava, Sadie.

870
00:46:58,775 --> 00:47:00,834
- Mazel tov, Sadie, mazel tov.

871
00:47:00,834 --> 00:47:01,802
- Thank you.

872
00:47:01,802 --> 00:47:05,048
- No, you're gonna run for president now?

873
00:47:05,048 --> 00:47:06,521
- Or even mayor of New York?

874
00:47:06,521 --> 00:47:07,354
- Signorina.

875
00:47:07,354 --> 00:47:08,187
Scusa.

876
00:47:08,187 --> 00:47:09,447
Sadie, one moment, please.

877
00:47:09,447 --> 00:47:10,702
- I'm very busy now, Marcello.

878
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:12,428
I've got to shop for
my mother and get home.

879
00:47:12,428 --> 00:47:14,982
- Yes, Christmas Eve, the
policemen they make a big party

880
00:47:14,982 --> 00:47:16,622
for the neighborhood, everybody come.

881
00:47:16,622 --> 00:47:20,837
I was wondering dearest
Sadie, if you would,

882
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:22,716
if you would be there too?

883
00:47:22,716 --> 00:47:25,340
- I have more on my mind than parties.

884
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:28,532
- Yes, but you dance as well as you march.

885
00:47:28,532 --> 00:47:30,016
- Look Marcello...

886
00:47:30,016 --> 00:47:34,189
♫ A girl with a drive
and a fellow with a dream

887
00:47:34,189 --> 00:47:38,467
♫ Are like pickled herring
with vanilla ice cream

888
00:47:38,467 --> 00:47:43,467
♫ So, as unromantic as my words may seem

889
00:47:43,467 --> 00:47:47,167
♫ We don't go together at all

890
00:47:47,167 --> 00:47:50,799
♫ My big loud mouth and your quiet ways

891
00:47:50,799 --> 00:47:55,372
♫ Are like August evenings
with December days

892
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:59,736
♫ Are like corned beef and
cabbage topped with mayonnaise

893
00:47:59,736 --> 00:48:03,156
♫ We don't go together at all

894
00:48:03,156 --> 00:48:06,656
♫ We're like chicken soup

895
00:48:08,459 --> 00:48:12,223
♫ And a slice of ham

896
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:15,261
♫ We're the big bad wolf

897
00:48:15,261 --> 00:48:18,428
♫ And the little lamb

898
00:48:19,413 --> 00:48:22,489
♫ Like a picnic lunch

899
00:48:22,489 --> 00:48:27,063
♫ That's ruined by a sudden squall

900
00:48:27,063 --> 00:48:28,613
♫ We don't, no we don't

901
00:48:28,613 --> 00:48:32,696
♫ No we don't go together at all

902
00:48:33,902 --> 00:48:36,819
♫ Like an overcoat

903
00:48:38,713 --> 00:48:41,463
♫ And a hot July

904
00:48:42,652 --> 00:48:45,692
♫ Like a bowl of borscht

905
00:48:45,692 --> 00:48:48,525
♫ And a pizza pie

906
00:48:49,819 --> 00:48:52,669
♫ Like if I asked you

907
00:48:52,669 --> 00:48:57,306
♫ To come to the policemen's ball

908
00:48:57,306 --> 00:48:58,919
♫ We don't, no we don't

909
00:48:58,919 --> 00:49:03,002
♫ No we don't go together at all

910
00:49:04,743 --> 00:49:08,917
♫ An onion roll at a Mayfair tea

911
00:49:08,917 --> 00:49:13,247
♫ Like a march by Sousa in a minor key

912
00:49:13,247 --> 00:49:18,090
♫ So forget all the magic
that was meant to be

913
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:21,826
♫ We don't go together at all

914
00:49:21,826 --> 00:49:25,563
♫ A stable boy and a suffragette

915
00:49:25,563 --> 00:49:28,840
♫ Are about as peculiar as a pair can get

916
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,240
♫ So it's, oh, such a pity

917
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,157
♫ That we even met

918
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:41,226
♫ We don't go together at all

919
00:49:41,226 --> 00:49:44,643
♫ But, I like your spunk

920
00:49:45,865 --> 00:49:50,006
♫ And I like your pride

921
00:49:50,006 --> 00:49:53,069
♫ So I'll still be there

922
00:49:53,069 --> 00:49:56,402
♫ Marching at your side

923
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:00,233
♫ So, I guess, my friend

924
00:50:00,233 --> 00:50:04,233
♫ We must admit the simple fact

925
00:50:05,256 --> 00:50:08,756
♫ That opposites

926
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:11,673
♫ Oh yes opposites

927
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,345
♫ Attract

928
00:50:29,968 --> 00:50:31,791
- But Da, I haven't even
told you about the rally

929
00:50:31,791 --> 00:50:34,231
after Sadie's speech or nothing.

930
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:36,512
- I'll hear about it some other time.

931
00:50:36,512 --> 00:50:37,345
Bye child.

932
00:50:41,253 --> 00:50:42,472
(sighs)

933
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:44,864
You know I'd like to
stay with you, Princess.

934
00:50:44,864 --> 00:50:47,682
But, if I'm late, I'll be docked for sure.

935
00:50:47,682 --> 00:50:49,184
(mouth clicking)

936
00:50:49,184 --> 00:50:50,874
Mrs. North, evening.

937
00:50:50,874 --> 00:50:52,124
- Good evening.

938
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:04,496
Looks like it's just
the two of us tonight.

939
00:51:04,496 --> 00:51:07,485
All that walking, all of us
gathered there in the square.

940
00:51:07,485 --> 00:51:09,586
It was exhilarating, wasn't it?

941
00:51:09,586 --> 00:51:11,538
- I've never seen so
many people in one place

942
00:51:11,538 --> 00:51:12,965
in all of my life.

943
00:51:12,965 --> 00:51:14,826
- I was just thinking how much my husband

944
00:51:14,826 --> 00:51:16,808
would've enjoyed it.

945
00:51:16,808 --> 00:51:18,891
He so loves high spirits.

946
00:51:20,186 --> 00:51:21,734
- My mother too.

947
00:51:21,734 --> 00:51:24,266
- Well, there will certainly
be many more good times

948
00:51:24,266 --> 00:51:27,938
after your mother comes over from Ireland.

949
00:51:27,938 --> 00:51:28,771
- Yeah.

950
00:51:30,818 --> 00:51:32,477
Ah, who am I kidding?

951
00:51:32,477 --> 00:51:34,101
I'll never see her again.

952
00:51:34,101 --> 00:51:36,684
- Oh, of course you will, Nora.

953
00:51:37,717 --> 00:51:39,185
- It's been over a year.

954
00:51:39,185 --> 00:51:43,088
She probably won't even recognize me.

955
00:51:43,088 --> 00:51:46,317
- You remember what she
looks like, don't you?

956
00:51:46,317 --> 00:51:47,317
- Of course.

957
00:51:48,277 --> 00:51:52,317
She has red hair, sorta
brown red, like a penny.

958
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:53,218
Like mine.

959
00:51:53,218 --> 00:51:54,816
(somber music)

960
00:51:54,816 --> 00:51:59,125
And, she has freckles on
her arms and on her cheeks.

961
00:51:59,125 --> 00:52:01,792
And, two right up under her eye.

962
00:52:03,178 --> 00:52:05,746
She probably looks different now anyway.

963
00:52:05,746 --> 00:52:09,018
- She misses you just
as much as you miss her.

964
00:52:09,018 --> 00:52:11,557
She thinks about you just as often,

965
00:52:11,557 --> 00:52:13,355
maybe even more.

966
00:52:13,355 --> 00:52:14,487
- Yeah?

967
00:52:14,487 --> 00:52:17,785
- Can you keep a secret, Nora?

968
00:52:17,785 --> 00:52:20,490
I'm missing someone too.

969
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:23,958
Someone who's also very far away.

970
00:52:23,958 --> 00:52:27,346
And, when I'm missing
someone as I am right now,

971
00:52:27,346 --> 00:52:28,929
you know what I do?

972
00:52:30,128 --> 00:52:30,961
Well...

973
00:52:32,528 --> 00:52:37,478
I look up at the night sky
and find our special star.

974
00:52:37,478 --> 00:52:41,837
And, with every twinkle,
I know that the one I love

975
00:52:41,837 --> 00:52:43,337
is thinking of me.

976
00:52:44,176 --> 00:52:47,967
- You think my mother's
thinking of me right now too?

977
00:52:47,967 --> 00:52:49,884
- I know she is, kiddo.

978
00:52:53,208 --> 00:52:55,208
- Oh, Mrs. North, look.

979
00:52:55,208 --> 00:52:56,987
Ever seen the Vaudeville show?

980
00:52:56,987 --> 00:53:00,416
- No, but shall we buy a ticket?

981
00:53:00,416 --> 00:53:01,249
- Are you kidding?

982
00:53:01,249 --> 00:53:02,528
It costs two bits.

983
00:53:02,528 --> 00:53:03,361
- Oh.

984
00:53:04,446 --> 00:53:05,279
- Come on.

985
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:10,886
(lively music)
(crowd chattering)

986
00:53:17,913 --> 00:53:19,902
Oh, aren't they something?

987
00:53:19,902 --> 00:53:23,235
- Oh, I must say, they're a rare talent.

988
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:27,471
(audience applauding)

989
00:53:27,471 --> 00:53:30,471
(audience cheering)

990
00:53:34,993 --> 00:53:35,826
- Oh, Maud and Claude.

991
00:53:35,826 --> 00:53:38,525
I'm seen 'em a million times!

992
00:53:38,525 --> 00:53:40,274
(Claude whistling)

993
00:53:40,274 --> 00:53:41,823
- Come on, Nora.

994
00:53:41,823 --> 00:53:43,253
Out you go.

995
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:44,773
Before I gotta start charging you.

996
00:53:44,773 --> 00:53:46,075
- Oh, just another minute, Sean.

997
00:53:46,075 --> 00:53:47,946
My friend ain't seen it before.

998
00:53:47,946 --> 00:53:51,642
(Claude whistling)

999
00:53:51,642 --> 00:53:54,558
- Aye, you've got moxie,
Nora, I'll give you that.

1000
00:53:54,558 --> 00:53:56,459
But, I don't wanna lose my job.

1001
00:53:56,459 --> 00:53:57,703
- All right, we're going.

1002
00:53:57,703 --> 00:53:59,430
Don't bust your suspenders.

1003
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:00,739
- Thank you very much, Sean.

1004
00:54:00,739 --> 00:54:04,303

00:54:07,624 --> 00:54:09,099
Good night!

1008
00:54:09,099 --> 00:54:11,991

1009
00:54:11,991 --> 00:54:13,728
- Hey, look it.

1010
00:54:13,728 --> 00:54:16,395
Will you look at all this stuff.

00:57:49,323 --> 00:57:50,471
Well, we'll have to see about that.

1072
00:57:50,471 --> 00:57:53,555
And, in the meantime, I'll
be taking it, thank you.

1073
00:57:53,555 --> 00:57:55,558
- I beg your pardon, officer,

1074
00:57:55,558 --> 00:57:58,097
but these are very hard-working children.

1075
00:57:58,097 --> 00:58:00,881
And, if they say that they
have not stolen that tree,

1076
00:58:00,881 --> 00:58:02,123
then I believe them.

1077
00:58:02,123 --> 00:58:03,227
- Oh, I see.

1078
00:58:03,227 --> 00:58:05,801
So, they have you fooled
now as well, have they?

1079
00:58:05,801 --> 00:58:06,882
- Listen here, Doyle--

1080
00:58:06,882 --> 00:58:07,799
- Uh, Nora.

1081
00:58:09,364 --> 00:58:11,219
- Officer Doyle.

1082
00:58:11,219 --> 00:58:15,415
Look, I promise I ain't
gonna kick you no more, okay?

1083
00:58:15,415 --> 00:58:18,456
Okay, I ain't gonna throw
no more eggs at you either.

1084
00:58:18,456 --> 00:58:21,039
So, can we have the lousy tree?

1085
00:58:23,398 --> 00:58:26,194
- Well, it is a bit of a
scrawny old thing, isn't it?

1086
00:58:26,194 --> 00:58:27,264
Take it.

1087
00:58:27,264 --> 00:58:28,990
- Thank you, officer.

1088
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:31,392
- Mrs. North, I was wondering, ma'am,

1089
00:58:31,392 --> 00:58:33,268
seeing as you take to the children so,

1090
00:58:33,268 --> 00:58:34,923
maybe you'd be interested
in buying a ticket

1091
00:58:34,923 --> 00:58:36,384
for the policemen's benefit.

1092
00:58:36,384 --> 00:58:38,365
It'll be on over in Foley's Saloon.

1093
00:58:38,365 --> 00:58:40,861
And besides, we can't have
you spending Christmas Eve

1094
00:58:40,861 --> 00:58:42,413
by yourself, can we?

1095
00:58:42,413 --> 00:58:45,463
- Well, it wouldn't be the fist time.

1096
00:58:45,463 --> 00:58:46,836
But, it sounds lovely.

1097
00:58:46,836 --> 00:58:48,011
And, I'll take two tickets.

1098
00:58:48,011 --> 00:58:48,844
- Okay.

1099
00:58:48,844 --> 00:58:51,753
That'll be 50 cents, ma'am.

1100
00:58:51,753 --> 00:58:54,069
- And, there's something that
you could do for me, officer.

1101
00:58:54,069 --> 00:58:55,036
- Ma'am?

1102
00:58:55,036 --> 00:58:57,316
- You see the second
ticket is for my landlady,

1103
00:58:57,316 --> 00:58:59,984
Mrs. Lowenstein, and
I'd very much like you

1104
00:58:59,984 --> 00:59:03,466
to deliver her ticket to her personally.

1105
00:59:03,466 --> 00:59:04,492
- Me?

1106
00:59:04,492 --> 00:59:08,159
Oh, I don't think herself wants
much to do with me, ma'am.

1107
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:12,137
- I wonder if she might not
be a little bit afraid of you.

1108
00:59:12,137 --> 00:59:13,809
- Afraid of me?

1109
00:59:13,809 --> 00:59:14,642
Oh.

1110
00:59:15,942 --> 00:59:19,055
Well, I wish to God some
of it'd rub of on that one.

1111
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,943
- I told you, Doyle, I reformed.

1112
00:59:20,943 --> 00:59:21,839
- Oh yes.

1113
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:23,440
I'll believe that when I see it.

1114
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,682
Well, I'll do that for you, ma'am.

1115
00:59:24,682 --> 00:59:26,384
Good night to you now.

1116
00:59:26,384 --> 00:59:27,579
- Mrs. North, come on.

1117
00:59:27,579 --> 00:59:30,165
I was just telling the kids
about your idea for tomorrow.

1118
00:59:30,165 --> 00:59:32,962
- Yes, well Sadie gave me the notion.

1119
00:59:32,962 --> 00:59:36,327
Tomorrow, we all work as slowly

1120
00:59:36,327 --> 00:59:37,910
as we possibly can.

1121
00:59:38,803 --> 00:59:40,607
- It'll drive Tavish crazy.

1122
00:59:40,607 --> 00:59:42,077
So, that's the plan okay?

1123
00:59:42,077 --> 00:59:44,146
Tomorrow, slow as molasses.

1124
00:59:44,146 --> 00:59:45,248
Everybody got it?

1125
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:46,081
- [Children] Got it.

1126
00:59:46,081 --> 00:59:48,944
- But, what if Tavish gets mad?

1127
00:59:48,944 --> 00:59:50,771
- What if we get scared?

1128
00:59:50,771 --> 00:59:53,948
♫ Then all you have to do is whistle

1129
00:59:53,948 --> 00:59:58,260
♫ And you'll find me holding your hand

1130
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,231
♫ When life

1131
01:00:00,231 --> 01:00:04,398
♫ Doesn't go the way that you planned

1132
01:00:05,585 --> 01:00:07,556
♫ Whistle

1133
01:00:07,556 --> 01:00:10,401
♫ When you feel that no one is near

1134
01:00:10,401 --> 01:00:12,252
(children whistling)

1135
01:00:12,252 --> 01:00:14,835
(somber music)

1136
01:00:34,595 --> 01:00:37,095
(Santa sighs)

1137
01:00:40,447 --> 01:00:42,085
(loud knocking)
- Chief?

1138
01:00:42,085 --> 01:00:42,997
- Come in.

1139
01:00:42,997 --> 01:00:43,914
- Surprise!

1140
01:00:45,445 --> 01:00:48,028
(lively music)

1141
01:01:11,325 --> 01:01:13,325
- Okay fellas, bad idea.

1142
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,569
Well, we'll be leaving now.

1143
01:01:22,733 --> 01:01:24,109
I said we'll be leaving now.

1144
01:01:24,109 --> 01:01:24,942
Goodbye.

1145
01:01:24,942 --> 01:01:25,775
Merry Christmas.

1146
01:01:25,775 --> 01:01:26,694
- [Girl] We're going, we're going.

1147
01:01:26,694 --> 01:01:28,345
(speaking foreign language)

1148
01:01:28,345 --> 01:01:29,178
Okay!

1149
01:01:30,707 --> 01:01:31,540
Gee whiz.

1150
01:01:35,934 --> 01:01:39,398
- Not even one little ho, ho, ho?

1151
01:01:39,398 --> 01:01:40,231
- Ho.

1152
01:01:42,194 --> 01:01:43,701
(bells jingling)

1153
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:46,534
- Look chief, she's gonna be back.

1154
01:01:47,386 --> 01:01:49,980
- We've been together
from the very beginning.

1155
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:52,017
Without her I feel like, I feel like

1156
01:01:52,017 --> 01:01:55,130
there's no such thing as Santa Claus.

1157
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:56,233
If only I'd taken the time to tell her

1158
01:01:56,233 --> 01:01:57,738
what she means to me.

1159
01:01:57,738 --> 01:01:59,752
- Why don't you tell her now?

1160
01:01:59,752 --> 01:02:00,585
- Now?

1161
01:02:01,722 --> 01:02:05,889
- Millions of children write
letters to you every year.

1162
01:02:06,935 --> 01:02:09,727
Maybe it's time for Santa to write one.

1163
01:02:09,727 --> 01:02:12,560
- We don't even know where she is.

1164
01:02:13,598 --> 01:02:17,765
- Maybe just getting the
words on paper would help.

1165
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:23,177
It's just a thought.

1166
01:02:24,193 --> 01:02:27,276
(somber flute music)

1167
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:44,183
♫ Dear Mrs. Santa Claus

1168
01:02:45,951 --> 01:02:48,868
♫ Wherever you are

1169
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:54,340
♫ I'm without you as lost

1170
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:58,672
♫ As some little star

1171
01:02:59,775 --> 01:03:02,234
♫ You're not there when I call

1172
01:03:02,234 --> 01:03:06,317
♫ And, so everything's all askew

1173
01:03:08,768 --> 01:03:11,694
♫ So I guess little wife

1174
01:03:11,694 --> 01:03:15,777
♫ That the joy in my life is you

1175
01:03:20,972 --> 01:03:24,305
♫ Dear Mrs. Santa Claus

1176
01:03:25,346 --> 01:03:28,763
♫ How I hope you can see

1177
01:03:30,152 --> 01:03:32,652
♫ From now on

1178
01:03:33,647 --> 01:03:37,814
♫ What a drastic change there will be

1179
01:03:39,070 --> 01:03:41,869
♫ So, I wish on the moon

1180
01:03:41,869 --> 01:03:44,580
♫ You'll come home to me soon

1181
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:46,747
♫ Because

1182
01:03:49,239 --> 01:03:53,072
♫ You'll never know how Santa

1183
01:03:55,997 --> 01:03:58,997
♫ Misses Mrs. Claus

1184
01:04:11,629 --> 01:04:14,296
(bells chiming)

1185
01:04:16,564 --> 01:04:19,897
(horse hooves clomping)

1186
01:04:24,212 --> 01:04:26,775
- My fancy customer from uptown.

1187
01:04:26,775 --> 01:04:30,456
So, now she decides she
don't want red after all.

1188
01:04:30,456 --> 01:04:31,618
Hmm!

1189
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:34,285
(loud knocking)

1190
01:04:38,982 --> 01:04:39,982
- Oh, Sadie.

1191
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:43,629
I was wondering is your mother in?

1192
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:44,641
Oh, Mrs. Lowenstein.

1193
01:04:44,641 --> 01:04:45,690
- Officer, Your Honor.

1194
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:46,620
She's a good girl.

1195
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:48,220
She didn't mean to start nothing.

1196
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:49,747
- Well, from what I've been told,

1197
01:04:49,747 --> 01:04:51,198
she started plenty.

1198
01:04:51,198 --> 01:04:52,624
- Oh no!

1199
01:04:52,624 --> 01:04:54,715
- Sure did my own mother
go up there to Union Square

1200
01:04:54,715 --> 01:04:56,960
to hear them all cheering for your Sadie.

1201
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,490
(chuckles) She's a regular
Susan MacAnthony, that one.

1202
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:01,323
- See Mama.

1203
01:05:01,323 --> 01:05:04,149
- Oh, and by the way, Mrs. L,
somebody bought you a ticket

1204
01:05:04,149 --> 01:05:07,046
for our precinct Christmas party.

1205
01:05:07,046 --> 01:05:10,898
It'll be on over in
Foley's Saloon, so it will.

1206
01:05:10,898 --> 01:05:13,416
- Who is this does such a thing?

1207
01:05:13,416 --> 01:05:17,271
- Well, let's just say
it's your own Secret Santa.

1208
01:05:17,271 --> 01:05:19,794
And, it'd be giving myself and to the lads

1209
01:05:19,794 --> 01:05:21,802
at the precinct much pleasure

1210
01:05:21,802 --> 01:05:25,136
if our favorite hostess could attend.

1211
01:05:25,136 --> 01:05:26,632
- Me, you're talking about?

1212
01:05:26,632 --> 01:05:28,049
- Sure, who else?

1213
01:05:30,494 --> 01:05:34,818
So, we'll be seeing
you Christmas Eve then?

1214
01:05:34,818 --> 01:05:36,568
Good day to you both.

1215
01:05:49,618 --> 01:05:50,907
(slow music)

1216
01:05:50,907 --> 01:05:53,990
- No, my dumplings, I
think a proper slowdown

1217
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:55,740
would be even slower.

1218
01:05:59,818 --> 01:06:00,651
Slowly.

1219
01:06:03,907 --> 01:06:05,939
Oh that's perfect, Emilio.

1220
01:06:05,939 --> 01:06:06,772
Fine.

1221
01:06:09,066 --> 01:06:10,783
- You think this is really gonna work?

1222
01:06:10,783 --> 01:06:13,395
- It's better than do
nothing and freezing.

1223
01:06:13,395 --> 01:06:17,041
- But, we've got to stick
together like glue, Fritzie.

1224
01:06:17,041 --> 01:06:19,214
It's only when the wheels turn together

1225
01:06:19,214 --> 01:06:20,872
that the train can move.

1226
01:06:20,872 --> 01:06:21,930
(train clattering)

1227
01:06:21,930 --> 01:06:22,763
Oh.

1228
01:06:25,067 --> 01:06:28,150
- And, how are my little elves today?

1229
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:33,320
What, may I ask, is happening here?

1230
01:06:35,233 --> 01:06:37,680
Busiest week of the
busiest season and I see

1231
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,597
four, five, six trains.

1232
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:43,477
Three teddy bears.

1233
01:06:43,477 --> 01:06:45,999
Mrs. North, I demand
an explanation at once.

1234
01:06:45,999 --> 01:06:46,999
(cane clacking)

1235
01:06:46,999 --> 01:06:48,863
- I believe that it's the cold air

1236
01:06:48,863 --> 01:06:50,840
that is slowing up down, Mr. Tavish.

1237
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:54,095
Perhaps some coal on the
fire would pick up the pace.

1238
01:06:54,095 --> 01:06:56,315
- I'm on to you, Mrs. North.

1239
01:06:56,315 --> 01:06:59,615
This little slowdown is
your handiwork, isn't it?

1240
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:02,675
- Oh, not just mine,
it's all of us together.

1241
01:07:02,675 --> 01:07:07,204
- [Children] Yeah, that's
right, together, yeah.

1242
01:07:07,204 --> 01:07:11,371
- Well then, it's my pleasure
to inform all of you together

1243
01:07:12,207 --> 01:07:15,326
that you'll be spending
Christmas Day right here!

1244
01:07:15,326 --> 01:07:17,488
- [Children] No!

1245
01:07:17,488 --> 01:07:19,059
- Oh now just a moment, Mr. Tavish.

1246
01:07:19,059 --> 01:07:20,938
What possible use could
all the children be

1247
01:07:20,938 --> 01:07:22,212
to you on Christmas?

1248
01:07:22,212 --> 01:07:25,283
I mean, all of the toys
will have been delivered.

1249
01:07:25,283 --> 01:07:26,559
- Clean up, Mrs. North.

1250
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:30,184
A good scrubbing down of
all the walls and floors.

1251
01:07:30,184 --> 01:07:31,769
- [Children] No!

1252
01:07:31,769 --> 01:07:34,057
- Now children, remember,
stick together like the wheels

1253
01:07:34,057 --> 01:07:35,520
on a train.

1254
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,160
(children chattering)

1255
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:39,944
- I will let you off an
hour early for Christmas

1256
01:07:39,944 --> 01:07:44,670
if you tell me did Mrs.
North put you up to this?

1257
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:46,521
- Yeah, she's the brains
behind the whole thing.

1258
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:47,936
- She made us do it.

1259
01:07:47,936 --> 01:07:49,303
- [Boy] It was her.

1260
01:07:49,303 --> 01:07:51,662
- Then she took Christmas
away from you, didn't she?

1261
01:07:51,662 --> 01:07:52,890
Shall I let her go?

1262
01:07:52,890 --> 01:07:53,742
- [Children] Yes!

1263
01:07:53,742 --> 01:07:54,940
- Find you a new supervisor?

1264
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:56,480
- [Children] Yes!

1265
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:00,424
- There you have it, Mrs.
North, democracy in action.

1266
01:08:00,424 --> 01:08:01,507
Now, get out!

1267
01:08:05,682 --> 01:08:06,655
- [Man] Careful with those.

1268
01:08:06,655 --> 01:08:08,488
- [Man] Okay watch it.

1269
01:08:14,886 --> 01:08:16,719
- Nora, I am so sorry.

1270
01:08:17,973 --> 01:08:19,847
- It's not your fault.

1271
01:08:19,847 --> 01:08:21,355
To tell you the truth,
I wouldn't have minded

1272
01:08:21,355 --> 01:08:23,264
working on Christmas.

1273
01:08:23,264 --> 01:08:24,922
I hate Christmas anyway.

1274
01:08:24,922 --> 01:08:27,498
- Oh Nora, you can't mean that.

1275
01:08:27,498 --> 01:08:29,252
- I'm afraid I do.
(dog barking)

1276
01:08:29,252 --> 01:08:32,098
Without my mother here, it's
just another day of the week.

1277
01:08:32,098 --> 01:08:34,501
- Well, I know just what you mean,

1278
01:08:34,501 --> 01:08:38,141
but Christmas or not, people
shouldn't have to work

1279
01:08:38,141 --> 01:08:40,638
under those conditions.

1280
01:08:40,638 --> 01:08:42,340
- Well, we tried.

1281
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:45,192
- Well, thank you for standing
up for me with Mr. Tavish.

1282
01:08:45,192 --> 01:08:46,525
That took moxie.

1283
01:08:50,615 --> 01:08:53,732
- Well, I guess I better
start looking for another job

1284
01:08:53,732 --> 01:08:55,013
or we'll never have
enough to bring my mother

1285
01:08:55,013 --> 01:08:57,474
and my brother over.

1286
01:08:57,474 --> 01:09:00,994
- When I think of those poor
children working so hard,

1287
01:09:00,994 --> 01:09:04,384
their little fingers turning to icicles.

1288
01:09:04,384 --> 01:09:08,134
Nora, there must be
something that we can do.

1289
01:09:09,441 --> 01:09:13,582
♫ Whatever rut you get stuck in

1290
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:18,559
♫ You'll feel me pulling you through

1291
01:09:18,559 --> 01:09:21,745
♫ And then and forevermore more

1292
01:09:21,745 --> 01:09:25,793
♫ You'll hear me whistling for you

1293
01:09:25,793 --> 01:09:27,645
(whistling)

1294
01:09:27,645 --> 01:09:30,010
(laughing)

1295
01:09:30,010 --> 01:09:32,677
(dynamic music)

1296
01:09:35,879 --> 01:09:38,462
(lively music)

1297
01:09:40,682 --> 01:09:42,932
- Always wanted to do that.

1298
01:09:50,587 --> 01:09:52,170
Mmm, Auggie Tavish.

1299
01:10:00,143 --> 01:10:02,372
Right, sweetheart, the coast is clear.

1300
01:10:02,372 --> 01:10:03,592
- Hey, how'd you do that?

1301
01:10:03,592 --> 01:10:05,408
- Oh, little trick my husband taught me.

1302
01:10:05,408 --> 01:10:06,249
- Anybody see ya?

1303
01:10:06,249 --> 01:10:07,082
- Not yet.

1304
01:10:11,572 --> 01:10:13,609
- We should've stuck with Mrs. North.

1305
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:15,219
- Then we'd be out of our jobs.

1306
01:10:15,219 --> 01:10:17,129
- Yeah, but at least we
wouldn't be freezing.

1307
01:10:17,129 --> 01:10:18,714
- Ah, quit your bellyaching.

1308
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:19,668
The slowdown didn't work.

1309
01:10:19,668 --> 01:10:21,361
And it didn't work because--
It didn't work because

1310
01:10:21,361 --> 01:10:24,187
we didn't believe in ourselves enough.

1311
01:10:24,187 --> 01:10:25,547
- [Boy] Mrs. North.

1312
01:10:25,547 --> 01:10:26,521
- [Girl] What are you doing here?

1313
01:10:26,521 --> 01:10:28,500
- You better not let Tavish find you.

1314
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:31,043
- Tavis don't scare us,
does he, Mrs. North?

1315
01:10:31,043 --> 01:10:33,652
- The only way we'll succeed with Tavish,

1316
01:10:33,652 --> 01:10:36,023
is if you children stick together.

1317
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:37,205
- Not that again.

1318
01:10:37,205 --> 01:10:39,427
- Well, not just the children in here,

1319
01:10:39,427 --> 01:10:43,073
but all of the children
in the entire city.

1320
01:10:43,073 --> 01:10:46,946
What if you told every
boy and girl in New York

1321
01:10:46,946 --> 01:10:50,513
that Tavish Toys fall apart
the day after Christmas?

1322
01:10:50,513 --> 01:10:54,527
What if everyone knew that
little children suffered

1323
01:10:54,527 --> 01:10:55,665
to make them.

1324
01:10:55,665 --> 01:10:59,665
I'm talking about a strike,
a boycott, citywide.

1325
01:11:00,667 --> 01:11:02,731
And I want to know who's with me.

1326
01:11:02,731 --> 01:11:04,383
- Mr. Tavish ain't gonna like that.

1327
01:11:04,383 --> 01:11:06,233
- He'll just fire us and hire other kids.

1328
01:11:06,233 --> 01:11:08,419
- Oh, not when they find out how shabbily

1329
01:11:08,419 --> 01:11:10,409
you children have been treated.

1330
01:11:10,409 --> 01:11:12,593
- Nobody cares about kids from Avenue A.

1331
01:11:12,593 --> 01:11:15,476
- Well, I care, Henry,
and I care very much.

1332
01:11:15,476 --> 01:11:18,091
And, I know that others will too.

1333
01:11:18,091 --> 01:11:19,757
But, we've got to tell them.

1334
01:11:19,757 --> 01:11:21,091
Now, who will join me?

1335
01:11:21,091 --> 01:11:21,965
- I will!

1336
01:11:21,965 --> 01:11:23,252
- Big surprise.

1337
01:11:23,252 --> 01:11:24,633
- And, what about the rest of you?

1338
01:11:24,633 --> 01:11:26,335
Will one more join in?

1339
01:11:26,335 --> 01:11:28,752
Will someone else say strike?

1340
01:11:31,431 --> 01:11:35,264
Who will help get Tavish
Toys off the shelves?

1341
01:11:37,617 --> 01:11:39,113
- Strike!

1342
01:11:39,113 --> 01:11:40,738
- He talks!

1343
01:11:40,738 --> 01:11:42,516
- If Emilio's in, I'm in too.

1344
01:11:42,516 --> 01:11:43,795
And I say strike.

1345
01:11:43,795 --> 01:11:45,000
- Me too.

1346
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,095
- Hey, move over, you aren't in before me.

1347
01:11:47,095 --> 01:11:47,928
Strike.

1348
01:11:47,928 --> 01:11:48,772
- [Children] Strike!

1349
01:11:48,772 --> 01:11:52,084
Strike, strike, strike, strike,

1350
01:11:52,084 --> 01:11:54,363
strike, strike, strike.

1351
01:11:54,363 --> 01:11:56,341
- [Nora] Take Tavish Toys off the shelves.

1352
01:11:56,341 --> 01:11:58,778
Don't buy Tavish Toys.

1353
01:11:58,778 --> 01:12:00,536
- [Children] Strike, strike, strike.

1354
01:12:00,536 --> 01:12:01,403
(lively music)

1355
01:12:01,403 --> 01:12:02,393
(neighbors shouting)

1356
01:12:02,393 --> 01:12:04,279
- Thank you very much.

1357
01:12:04,279 --> 01:12:06,224
- Sorry, lady!

1358
01:12:06,224 --> 01:12:08,674
- Here are some Tavish Toys for you.

1359
01:12:08,674 --> 01:12:10,167
- [Child] Oh, thank you.

1360
01:12:10,167 --> 01:12:11,387
(lively music)

1361
01:12:11,387 --> 01:12:13,465
- [Nora] Take Tavish Toys off the shelves.

1362
01:12:13,465 --> 01:12:16,273
Tavish Toys aren't built to last.

1363
01:12:16,273 --> 01:12:18,031
- You know, darling, I
may have underestimated

1364
01:12:18,031 --> 01:12:19,983
the difficulty of your job.

1365
01:12:19,983 --> 01:12:22,143
- [Nora] Tavish toys are defective.

1366
01:12:22,143 --> 01:12:24,719
- [Mayor] As mayor, I pledge
that no child will ever again

1367
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:26,630
work under deplorable
conditions like those

1368
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:28,546
of the Tavish Toy Company.

1369
01:12:28,546 --> 01:12:29,575
- [Photographer] Over here, Mr. Mayor.

1370
01:12:29,575 --> 01:12:30,675
(crowd applauding)

1371
01:12:30,675 --> 01:12:31,779
Right here, please.

1372
01:12:31,779 --> 01:12:35,196
(flash powder exploding)

1373
01:12:36,825 --> 01:12:38,126
- [Paperboy] Extra, extra.

1374
01:12:38,126 --> 01:12:41,565
Children's crusade
closes down Tavish Toys.

1375
01:12:41,565 --> 01:12:43,390
Read all about it.

1376
01:12:43,390 --> 01:12:44,938
Extra, extra.

1377
01:12:44,938 --> 01:12:47,688
(dramatic music)

1378
01:12:48,685 --> 01:12:49,768
- Mrs. North!

1379
01:12:52,135 --> 01:12:55,736
(shouting)
(toys clattering)

1380
01:12:55,736 --> 01:12:57,587
- There's an outcry for child labor laws

1381
01:12:57,587 --> 01:12:59,103
all over New York.

1382
01:12:59,103 --> 01:13:00,658
Thanks to you, Mrs. North.

1383
01:13:00,658 --> 01:13:03,825
- Oh, you were the inspiration, Sadie.

1384
01:13:04,684 --> 01:13:08,851
- Another picture of your
father, may he rest in peace.

1385
01:13:10,212 --> 01:13:13,145
And, my grandmother's candlesticks.

1386
01:13:13,145 --> 01:13:14,332
Look, Sadie.

1387
01:13:14,332 --> 01:13:16,285
Only one candlestick now.

1388
01:13:16,285 --> 01:13:17,868
The other was lost.

1389
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:20,747
- It's beautiful.

1390
01:13:20,747 --> 01:13:23,875
- So, Mama, tell me,
you're unpacking your bag.

1391
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:27,049
Does this mean we'll
be staying here awhile?

1392
01:13:27,049 --> 01:13:27,882
- What?

1393
01:13:27,882 --> 01:13:29,142
You don't like America?

1394
01:13:29,142 --> 01:13:32,950
(chuckles) You got someplace better to go?

1395
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:34,867
Oh, my mother's broach.

1396
01:13:37,325 --> 01:13:40,901
I think I'll wear it to the
policemen's party tonight.

1397
01:13:40,901 --> 01:13:42,882
- You're going to the
Christmas party, Mama?

1398
01:13:42,882 --> 01:13:45,976
- I got a ticket, so why shouldn't I go?

1399
01:13:45,976 --> 01:13:47,518
You're coming, Mrs. North?

1400
01:13:47,518 --> 01:13:50,656
- Oh, I wouldn't miss it (chuckles).

1401
01:13:50,656 --> 01:13:52,370
- And, this is what you're wearing?

1402
01:13:52,370 --> 01:13:53,203
- Hmm?

1403
01:13:55,825 --> 01:13:57,258
(sighs)

1404
01:13:57,258 --> 01:14:01,425
(crowd chattering)
(upbeat music)

1405
01:14:07,691 --> 01:14:09,163
- Ah, Mrs. North, I have good news.

1406
01:14:09,163 --> 01:14:11,323
Eh, Cupid, his leg is all fixed.

1407
01:14:11,323 --> 01:14:12,705
- (sighs) Oh, thank you, Marcello.

1408
01:14:12,705 --> 01:14:13,680
Thank you.

1409
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:16,597
(crowd applauding)

1410
01:14:22,181 --> 01:14:24,481
- Everyone, may I have
your attention, please?

1411
01:14:24,481 --> 01:14:25,450
May I, please?

1412
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:26,529
Thank you.

1413
01:14:26,529 --> 01:14:29,460
I know it may seem unusual, a Jewish girl

1414
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:31,125
making a Christmas toast.

1415
01:14:31,125 --> 01:14:31,958
(crowd chattering)

1416
01:14:31,958 --> 01:14:34,324
But, as most of you know,
I have the biggest mouth

1417
01:14:34,324 --> 01:14:35,311
on Avenue A.

1418
01:14:35,311 --> 01:14:38,160
(crowd lauding)

1419
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:38,993
- Oh no.

1420
01:14:40,569 --> 01:14:42,501
- I'd like to thank
someone we've only known

1421
01:14:42,501 --> 01:14:46,825
a very short while, but who
has already given so much

1422
01:14:46,825 --> 01:14:50,309
to me and especially to the children.

1423
01:14:50,309 --> 01:14:52,977
Mrs. North, you've been
our good luck charm.

1424
01:14:52,977 --> 01:14:54,736
Come to think of it,
what you've really been

1425
01:14:54,736 --> 01:14:56,080
is our Santa Claus.

1426
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:57,945
- Mrs. Santa Claus.

1427
01:14:57,945 --> 01:14:59,161
- Right (chuckles).

1428
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:02,557
Here's to the Mrs.
Santa Claus of Avenue A.

1429
01:15:02,557 --> 01:15:03,640
(crowd applauding)

1430
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:04,890
- Brava, brava.

1431
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:08,933
Brava.

1432
01:15:12,056 --> 01:15:14,973
(slow dance music)

1433
01:15:16,577 --> 01:15:19,077
- [Boy] May I have this dance?

1434
01:16:06,303 --> 01:16:09,636
(horse hooves clomping)

1435
01:16:26,843 --> 01:16:27,676
- Nicky?

1436
01:16:28,843 --> 01:16:30,339
- It's only me.

1437
01:16:30,339 --> 01:16:32,280
Officer Doyle, Mrs. North.

1438
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:34,927
What are you doing up there
in the cold all by yourself?

1439
01:16:34,927 --> 01:16:38,392
- Oh, I was just looking for a star.

1440
01:16:38,392 --> 01:16:40,391
- Good night to you now.

1441
01:16:40,391 --> 01:16:42,654
And, Merry Christmas.

1442
01:16:42,654 --> 01:16:45,404
(tinkling music)

1443
01:16:51,431 --> 01:16:54,981
♫ Every time a star is falling

1444
01:16:54,981 --> 01:16:59,148
♫ Someone that you love is calling

1445
01:17:04,003 --> 01:17:06,503
♫ He needs me

1446
01:17:08,242 --> 01:17:11,159
♫ Yes, he needs me

1447
01:17:12,259 --> 01:17:16,176
♫ Don't even ask me how I know

1448
01:17:19,018 --> 01:17:20,016
♫ I know

1449
01:17:20,016 --> 01:17:22,933
♫ When he calls me

1450
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:27,761
♫ My heart hears him

1451
01:17:27,761 --> 01:17:30,370
♫ And tells me that it's time

1452
01:17:30,370 --> 01:17:32,953
♫ For me to go

1453
01:17:35,574 --> 01:17:38,241
♫ He's my world

1454
01:17:39,156 --> 01:17:41,739
♫ And I am his

1455
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,507
♫ He's my world

1456
01:17:46,464 --> 01:17:48,808
♫ And journey's end

1457
01:17:48,808 --> 01:17:51,558
♫ Is where he is

1458
01:17:53,033 --> 01:17:55,950
♫ And his laughter

1459
01:17:57,111 --> 01:18:00,684
♫ Is my laughter

1460
01:18:00,684 --> 01:18:04,851
♫ And tells me what I'm living for

1461
01:18:07,173 --> 01:18:10,590
♫ And so, if he needs me

1462
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:14,127
♫ I'll go

1463
01:18:16,136 --> 01:18:19,136
♫ 'Cause I need him

1464
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:23,233
♫ Much more

1465
01:18:41,559 --> 01:18:43,859
I have to leave now, sweetheart.

1466
01:18:43,859 --> 01:18:45,191
- All right, I'll see you tomorrow.

1467
01:18:45,191 --> 01:18:46,356
- Well, I'm afraid not.

1468
01:18:46,356 --> 01:18:48,611
You see, I'm needed back home.

1469
01:18:48,611 --> 01:18:51,155
- But you can't go, not yet.

1470
01:18:51,155 --> 01:18:52,516
- I'm afraid I have to.

1471
01:18:52,516 --> 01:18:54,839
But, I haven't forgotten
about the Christmas presents

1472
01:18:54,839 --> 01:18:57,227
for you and for the others.

1473
01:18:57,227 --> 01:18:59,107
- Am I ever going to see you again?

1474
01:18:59,107 --> 01:19:01,230
- Oh, I hope so.

1475
01:19:01,230 --> 01:19:04,480
But, until then, remember, just look up

1476
01:19:05,422 --> 01:19:07,951
at the night sky and you'll know

1477
01:19:07,951 --> 01:19:10,284
when I'm thinking about you.

1478
01:19:18,918 --> 01:19:21,905
♫ He's my world

1479
01:19:21,905 --> 01:19:24,488
♫ And I am his

1480
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:28,782
♫ He's my world

1481
01:19:28,782 --> 01:19:32,949
♫ And journey's end is where he is

1482
01:19:34,302 --> 01:19:37,914
♫ And his laughter

1483
01:19:37,914 --> 01:19:41,262
♫ Is my laughter

1484
01:19:41,262 --> 01:19:45,429
♫ And tells me what I'm living for

1485
01:19:47,164 --> 01:19:50,581
♫ And so, if he needs me

1486
01:19:52,311 --> 01:19:54,478
♫ I'll go

1487
01:19:57,534 --> 01:20:00,534
♫ 'Cause I need him

1488
01:20:02,943 --> 01:20:05,276
♫ Much more

1489
01:20:24,921 --> 01:20:25,754
Cupid?

1490
01:20:29,966 --> 01:20:31,066
(horse whinnying)

1491
01:20:31,066 --> 01:20:32,528
Comet?

1492
01:20:32,528 --> 01:20:34,034
Donder?

1493
01:20:34,034 --> 01:20:35,617
Where are you boys?

1494
01:20:42,394 --> 01:20:43,227
(horse whinnying)

1495
01:20:43,227 --> 01:20:44,060
Oh.

1496
01:20:47,346 --> 01:20:48,179
(ominous music)

1497
01:20:48,179 --> 01:20:51,270
- Missing something, Mrs. North?

1498
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:53,603
Or should I say, Mrs. Claus?

1499
01:20:57,439 --> 01:20:59,356
- Oh, how did you know?

1500
01:21:00,266 --> 01:21:03,186
- Oh, I've had my suspicions all along.

1501
01:21:03,186 --> 01:21:06,090
First, there was your
knowledge of toy-making.

1502
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:08,862
And, then the name, Mrs. North,

1503
01:21:08,862 --> 01:21:10,279
as in North Pole.

1504
01:21:11,962 --> 01:21:12,879
Nice touch.

1505
01:21:13,966 --> 01:21:18,146
And, when I realized you'd
come down the chimney,

1506
01:21:18,146 --> 01:21:20,896
(chuckles) well!

1507
01:21:22,184 --> 01:21:26,351
- (sighs) Mr. Tavish, without the reindeer

1508
01:21:27,681 --> 01:21:31,325
the children won't be able
to receive their toys.

1509
01:21:31,325 --> 01:21:32,158
(horse whinnying)

1510
01:21:32,158 --> 01:21:32,991
- Pity.

1511
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:37,383
- But, you'll be ruining Christmas.

1512
01:21:37,383 --> 01:21:38,383
- Precisely.

1513
01:21:40,301 --> 01:21:43,308
By morning, all of New York
will come crawling back

1514
01:21:43,308 --> 01:21:45,141
to Augustus P. Tavish.

1515
01:21:46,473 --> 01:21:47,990
- Of course.

1516
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:50,157
Poor little Auggie Tavish.

1517
01:21:51,765 --> 01:21:55,228
You wrote to Santa
asking for a stuffed bear

1518
01:21:55,228 --> 01:21:56,978
back in 1872, was it?

1519
01:21:58,517 --> 01:22:01,049
And, Santa brought you
the most beautiful bear.

1520
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:03,882
It had a vest with a satin lining.

1521
01:22:05,009 --> 01:22:07,329
But, then you never wrote to him again.

1522
01:22:07,329 --> 01:22:09,987
- You mean, Santa noticed that?

1523
01:22:09,987 --> 01:22:13,806
- Oh, he mentioned it several times.

1524
01:22:13,806 --> 01:22:18,165
- Well, you see, my step
brother, he stole my bear

1525
01:22:18,165 --> 01:22:20,110
on Christmas Day.

1526
01:22:20,110 --> 01:22:22,354
- And, you loved it so.

1527
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:24,985
And, you thought you'd never
have another one like it.

1528
01:22:24,985 --> 01:22:26,809
- Yes, that's right.

1529
01:22:26,809 --> 01:22:29,141
- So, you wanted to ruin
every child's Christmas

1530
01:22:29,141 --> 01:22:31,209
just the way yours had been ruined.

1531
01:22:31,209 --> 01:22:32,374
- Yes, it's true.

1532
01:22:32,374 --> 01:22:34,225
I can't deny.

1533
01:22:34,225 --> 01:22:36,457
- Well, Auggie, you don't have to destroy

1534
01:22:36,457 --> 01:22:38,957
anyone's Christmas ever again.

1535
01:22:40,085 --> 01:22:41,002
Here, dear.

1536
01:22:42,385 --> 01:22:46,521
Just like the one you lost,
right down to the satin vest.

1537
01:22:46,521 --> 01:22:51,383
And, remember, it's not the
gift itself that matters.

1538
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:53,383
It's the love behind it.

1539
01:22:54,958 --> 01:22:55,958
- Thank you.

1540
01:22:58,677 --> 01:23:01,927
- Would you take me to my reindeer now?

1541
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:04,200
- Of course.

1542
01:23:08,472 --> 01:23:10,889
And, tell Santa I said hello.

1543
01:23:12,004 --> 01:23:15,337
- Of course (chuckles).

1544
01:23:22,584 --> 01:23:23,417
- Oh!

1545
01:23:28,816 --> 01:23:32,566
Christmas Eve and the
worst night of my life.

1546
01:23:33,806 --> 01:23:36,064
- Ah, there's still time.

1547
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:38,208
You have to believe.

1548
01:23:38,208 --> 01:23:39,736
- Hello.

1549
01:23:39,736 --> 01:23:40,855
Whoa, boys.

1550
01:23:40,855 --> 01:23:43,438
(upbeat music)

1551
01:23:46,323 --> 01:23:48,507
So sorry I'm late.

1552
01:23:48,507 --> 01:23:50,429
- If only you'd known
how worried I've been.

1553
01:23:50,429 --> 01:23:53,290
- Oh, did you miss me, Nick?

1554
01:23:53,290 --> 01:23:54,841
- More than you could ever know.

1555
01:23:54,841 --> 01:23:56,570
Where in the world have you been?

1556
01:23:56,570 --> 01:23:58,920
- Oh, you better hurry, kiddo.

1557
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:00,398
- Kiddo?

1558
01:24:00,398 --> 01:24:01,859
- Oh, that's New York talk.

1559
01:24:01,859 --> 01:24:03,311
I'll tell you about it tomorrow.

1560
01:24:03,311 --> 01:24:06,976
Tonight, the children are waiting for you.

1561
01:24:06,976 --> 01:24:07,893
Here, here.

1562
01:24:08,997 --> 01:24:11,308
Mustn't catch cold, must we.

1563
01:24:11,308 --> 01:24:13,256
Now, off you go.

1564
01:24:13,256 --> 01:24:16,916
I'll be here tomorrow morning
just like I always am.

1565
01:24:16,916 --> 01:24:18,916
- Anna, close your eyes.

1566
01:24:20,041 --> 01:24:21,816
And keep them closed.

1567
01:24:21,816 --> 01:24:23,183
- [Elf] Excuse me, Mrs. Claus.

1568
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:24,919
- Who is that?

1569
01:24:24,919 --> 01:24:27,575
What are you doing with my...

1570
01:24:27,575 --> 01:24:29,924
Arvo, what are you doing?

1571
01:24:29,924 --> 01:24:30,757
- Earrings.

1572
01:24:30,757 --> 01:24:31,840
- [Mrs. Claus] What is all this?

1573
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,688
- I have a surprise for you.

1574
01:24:33,688 --> 01:24:37,041
But first, you're going to
have to put on something warm.

1575
01:24:37,041 --> 01:24:38,624
Open your eyes now.

1576
01:24:41,983 --> 01:24:43,400
- Oh, Nick, Nick,

1577
01:24:46,231 --> 01:24:48,058
it's beautiful.
(dramatic music)

1578
01:24:48,058 --> 01:24:51,126
- This year, Anna, come with me.

1579
01:24:51,126 --> 01:24:52,596
- Oh, don't be silly.

1580
01:24:52,596 --> 01:24:56,054
- And, this year, I want
to use your new map.

1581
01:24:56,054 --> 01:24:57,220
- You are?

1582
01:24:57,220 --> 01:24:59,717
- Step lively, Mrs. Claus,
children are waiting.

1583
01:24:59,717 --> 01:25:02,156
- Well, when you put it that way.

1584
01:25:02,156 --> 01:25:04,239
(laughs)

1585
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:06,954
(reindeer groaning)

1586
01:25:06,954 --> 01:25:09,812
(elves chattering)

1587
01:25:09,812 --> 01:25:12,698
- [Santa] Oh, so sorry, Anna.

1588
01:25:12,698 --> 01:25:16,865
- Oh, this is so exciting (giggles).

1589
01:25:23,385 --> 01:25:24,218
(laughing)

1590
01:25:24,218 --> 01:25:25,110
- All right, then.

1591
01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:25,943
On Dasher.

1592
01:25:27,132 --> 01:25:29,332
Come on, Anna, you must know this by now.

1593
01:25:29,332 --> 01:25:30,332
- On Dancer.

1594
01:25:30,332 --> 01:25:31,165
- On Prancer.

1595
01:25:31,165 --> 01:25:31,998
- On Vixen.

1596
01:25:31,998 --> 01:25:33,382
- On Comet.

1597
01:25:33,382 --> 01:25:36,065
- Oh, how awful, I forget who's next.

1598
01:25:36,065 --> 01:25:36,898
- Cupid.

1599
01:25:36,898 --> 01:25:37,731
- Oh how silly.

1600
01:25:37,731 --> 01:25:40,726
How could I have forgotten
Cupid (chuckles).

1601
01:25:40,726 --> 01:25:42,022
- On Cupid.

1602
01:25:42,022 --> 01:25:44,070
- [Both] On Donder and Blitzen.

1603
01:25:44,070 --> 01:25:45,502
(both laughing)

1604
01:25:45,502 --> 01:25:46,766
(bells jingling)

1605
01:25:46,766 --> 01:25:48,306
- [Santa] Merry Christmas, Anna.

1606
01:25:48,306 --> 01:25:50,858
- [Mrs. Claus] Merry Christmas, Nicky.

1607
01:25:50,858 --> 01:25:53,973
♫ Through a navy blue night

1608
01:25:53,973 --> 01:25:57,614
♫ Crowned with shimmering stars

1609
01:25:57,614 --> 01:26:01,781
♫ To the kids of the world
I'll be paying my annual call

1610
01:26:03,968 --> 01:26:07,369
♫ But, now that you're sitting

1611
01:26:07,369 --> 01:26:09,955
♫ Beside me

1612
01:26:09,955 --> 01:26:14,122
♫ We'll have the best Christmas of all

1613
01:26:17,391 --> 01:26:20,549
♫ Flying over the clouds

1614
01:26:20,549 --> 01:26:23,853
♫ Floating under the moon

1615
01:26:23,853 --> 01:26:25,604
♫ As we watch and we wait

1616
01:26:25,604 --> 01:26:30,584
♫ For the first chimney top to appear

1617
01:26:30,584 --> 01:26:34,135
♫ But, now that you're sitting

1618
01:26:34,135 --> 01:26:36,527
♫ Beside me

1619
01:26:36,527 --> 01:26:40,694
♫ We'll have the best, Happy New Year

1620
01:26:43,331 --> 01:26:45,915
♫ Though the wind may be strong

1621
01:26:45,915 --> 01:26:49,957
♫ I will never complain dear

1622
01:26:49,957 --> 01:26:52,196
♫ I'm happy as long

1623
01:26:52,196 --> 01:26:56,279
♫ As there's you and my reindeer

1624
01:26:57,538 --> 01:27:00,516
♫ Through a navy blue night

1625
01:27:00,516 --> 01:27:03,817
♫ Crowned with shimmering stars

1626
01:27:03,817 --> 01:27:05,568
♫ In a moment I know

1627
01:27:05,568 --> 01:27:09,735
♫ That the first little
snowflake will fall

1628
01:27:10,681 --> 01:27:14,034
♫ But, now that you're sitting

1629
01:27:14,034 --> 01:27:16,480
♫ Beside me

1630
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:20,647
♫ We'll have the best Christmas of all

1631
01:27:23,147 --> 01:27:25,501
♫ Though the frost in the air

1632
01:27:25,501 --> 01:27:29,778
♫ Means a change in the weather

1633
01:27:29,778 --> 01:27:32,184
♫ But, what do we care

1634
01:27:32,184 --> 01:27:35,934
♫ When we're flying together

1635
01:27:42,751 --> 01:27:45,468
(both laughing)

1636
01:27:45,468 --> 01:27:48,446
- Oh look, we're coming
up on New York City.

1637
01:27:48,446 --> 01:27:50,863
- [Mrs. Claus] I know, Nicky.

1638
01:27:55,829 --> 01:27:56,912
- Nora, come.

1639
01:28:07,453 --> 01:28:10,870
(Mrs. Lowenstein crying)

1640
01:28:22,119 --> 01:28:24,786
(loud knocking)

1641
01:28:30,624 --> 01:28:31,475
- [Nora] Mama!

1642
01:28:31,475 --> 01:28:32,308
- Nora!

1643
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:34,266
Oh.

1644
01:28:40,161 --> 01:28:44,328
♫ When you're no longer kids
and have kids of your own

1645
01:28:46,729 --> 01:28:49,766
♫ You'll remember what
somebody said to you

1646
01:28:49,766 --> 01:28:53,546
♫ When you were small

1647
01:28:53,546 --> 01:28:57,713
♫ As long as you love one another

1648
01:28:59,467 --> 01:29:03,634
♫ You'll have the best Christmas of all

1649
01:29:06,804 --> 01:29:10,971
♫ As long as you love one another

1650
01:29:12,623 --> 01:29:16,854
♫ You'll have the best Christmas

1651
01:29:16,854 --> 01:29:23,892
♫ The best Christmas of all

1652
01:29:37,422 --> 01:29:41,589
("The Best Christmas of
All" by Jerry Herman)

1653
01:30:21,488 --> 01:30:24,155
(man whistling)
