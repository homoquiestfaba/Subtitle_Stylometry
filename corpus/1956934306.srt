00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:51,355
Let's do it.

700
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,236
Now that's a banger.

701
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:07,438
You mean a hammer?

702
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,306
No, I mean a banger.

703
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,075
Now, if that's B.S.
down 16 stairs

704

by a flooty, little turd
rockin' young-ass jeans

705
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,145
is a hammer.

706
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,446
A boner-inducing trick,

707
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,815
one of which
your pea-sized brain

708
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:20,218
can't possibly comprehend,
is a banger.

709
00:30:20,253 --> 00:30:21,818
Now please, stop looking at me

710
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:24,788
before I reconsider
our friendship.

711
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,693

Hey, you got it, boy.

You got this, man.

715
00:30:32,365 --> 00:30:33,263
Yeah, man.

Hold up, hold up.

00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,814
- Okay, let's get it, man.
- See that?

721
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,771
Hey, check it out real quick.

722

Yeah, man.

742
00:31:18,811 --> 00:31:20,010

a high school diploma...

858
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,590

01:02:02,953 --> 01:02:05,186
Anyway, did Troy settle down?

1602
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:06,155
He puked all over himself.

1603
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:07,456
He seriously tore down.

1604
01:02:07,491 --> 01:02:08,858
Fuck him.

1605
01:02:08,893 --> 01:02:10,926

Hey, break a leg.

1609
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:16,009
As a matter of fact, break both

1610
01:02:16,033 --> 01:02:16,965
so you can be in a wheelchair,

1611
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,077
and we can get
to the front of the line

1612
