Marina del Rey.

00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:32,351
Hell.

5
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:33,552
I was stuck.

6
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,957
It didn't matter where I
was, I was stuck but good.

7
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,195
The cinema is a brutal mistress.

8
00:01:45,597 --> 00:01:48,933
She seduces and tantalizes
your imagination

9
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:51,936
with great movements of
spectacle and human fury.

10
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,142
And then when you embrace
her, she abandons you

11
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:03,247
to the gossamer embers
of the seduction

12
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:05,183
and the possibilities to come.

13
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:08,953
But they never do come.

14
00:02:10,154 --> 00:02:13,392
Oh, I chased her with
all I could ever muster,

15
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,194
always climbing to
the promised land

16
00:02:16,227 --> 00:02:18,530
where your shit doesn't stink.

17
00:02:18,564 --> 00:02:20,097
You get your money for nothing.

18
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,368
Then I figured it out.

19
00:02:23,402 --> 00:02:25,970
Even if I got there,
it wouldn't fulfill me.

20
00:02:27,506 --> 00:02:31,075
An ethereal illusion with
certain disappointment.

21
00:02:31,108 --> 00:02:35,414
In the end, it just
left me with dread.

22
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:38,550
Unspecific, smoldering,

23
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,188
ever-present and unknown.

24
00:02:45,757 --> 00:02:46,492
Dread.

[soft music]

26
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,191
There are rumors,
they are true.

27
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:59,063
Board members and
minority shareholders

28
00:03:59,096 --> 00:04:01,533
see it in their best
interest to sell to us,

29
00:04:03,402 --> 00:04:05,269
but only if he is
not in the way.

30
00:04:06,237 --> 00:04:08,306
It's a lot of fuss over water.

31
00:04:15,246 --> 00:04:19,083
[Mikhail] Control the
water, control the economy.

32
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,053
You understand?

33
00:04:21,085 --> 00:04:22,186
Control everything.

34
00:04:25,757 --> 00:04:28,060
[Mikhail] But we
need your expertise.

35
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,462
For a price.

36
00:04:30,495 --> 00:04:32,129
[Mikhail] That
goes without saying.

37
00:04:32,163 --> 00:04:34,098
He's not an easy man to find.

38
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:40,171
No, but it must be soon.

39
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,775
Things are in motion that
would frustrate our plans.

40
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,579
I am sure you will find a way.

41
00:04:53,652 --> 00:04:55,988
There will be many rewards.

[wind whistling]

43
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:06,158
Perhaps maybe their
decision-making process

44
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,225
was not the best
choice at the time,

45
00:06:09,193 --> 00:06:11,329
but I have nothing to add

46
00:06:11,363 --> 00:06:13,031
other than what's in the film.

47
00:06:16,068 --> 00:06:17,201
It was perverse.

48
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,106
There I was being celebrated,

49
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:22,641
when with a few hiccups,

50
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,377
I could be penniless
and homeless.

51
00:06:28,914 --> 00:06:30,716
What will happen to me?

52
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,891
The march of time has
exacted a perverse

53
00:06:39,925 --> 00:06:42,060
and stiff ransom.

54
00:06:42,094 --> 00:06:45,530
And now, I am passed
over and ignored.

55
00:06:45,564 --> 00:06:47,899
Tossed aside like
an empty beer can

56
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:49,501

[somber music]

59
00:07:34,446 --> 00:07:37,415
Look for the signs and wonders.

60
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:40,252
That's the best I
could come up with.

61
00:07:40,284 --> 00:07:41,653
Look for the signs.

62
00:07:43,822 --> 00:07:46,658
I try man, I try.

63
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,463
The more gray hairs I get,
the less the phone rings.

64
00:07:51,496 --> 00:07:53,832
I have to fight to keep my edge,

65
00:07:53,865 --> 00:07:58,136
try new things, challenge
myself to learn new skills.

66
00:07:59,337 --> 00:08:02,974
The smallest act brings
the greatest treasure.

67
00:08:03,008 --> 00:08:04,409
The readiness is all.

68
00:08:05,477 --> 00:08:07,379
Dare the dread.

00:08:07,412 --> 00:08:09,481
Fight for justice.

Great, I like them too.

Where's your favorite
place to get them?

74
00:08:31,002 --> 00:08:31,870
why there?

75
00:08:43,014 --> 00:08:46,218
When was the last
time you were there?

76
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,392
Are you afraid to go out now?

77
00:08:56,194 --> 00:08:57,162
Why?

78
00:09:00,131 --> 00:09:02,701
Why don't you feel safe anymore?

79
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,841
Who attacked you?

80
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:31,596
Who else?

81
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:43,041

so I can get a level?

You're not gonna tell
me till I get there.

- I'm good.

Good, that's
actually terrific.

Would you like a water?

116
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,621
If that water is so wise,

117
00:13:16,654 --> 00:13:18,289
what's it doing
inside the bottle?

118
00:13:29,502 --> 00:13:30,436
You look kinda familiar.

seen any of my films.

Oh, okay, so Russia.

00:13:43,815 --> 00:13:45,083
They're cool.

They're actually
our best allies, so.

129
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:49,921
Oh yeah, who told you that?

130
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,656
[Driver] Well, the
president said so.

131
00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:55,126
What about their support
of the dictator Assad,

132
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,929
their expansion
into the Ukraine?

133
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,764
[Driver] Where did
you hear that from?

134
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,566
History.

135
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:01,966
It's all over the news.

136
00:14:03,234 --> 00:14:04,802
Must be fake news.

137
00:14:04,836 --> 00:14:06,838

that's what it must be.

And California farmers

139
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:18,384
may get some drought relief
from an unexpected source.

140
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:19,684
There are rumors that
reclusive billionaire,

141
00:14:19,717 --> 00:14:21,819
John T. Conover,
who built his empire

142
00:14:21,853 --> 00:14:23,688
on the Wise Water
brand, may allow farmers

143
00:14:23,721 --> 00:14:25,790
across the state to use
his newly discovered

144
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,859
vast underground reservoir
in the central valley

145
00:14:27,892 --> 00:14:29,461
to water their crops.

146
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:30,663
This comes as a surprise

147
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:32,531
since many observers
expected the shrewd dealmaker

148
00:14:32,565 --> 00:14:34,999
to sell his water rights to
the Aquavelt Corporation,

149
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:37,068

shareholders are not known

150
00:14:37,101 --> 00:14:39,971
to the public, at
very high premium.

00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:43,041
[Charlie Voiceover] I was
going to meet Boris Levashov.

152
00:14:43,074 --> 00:14:45,544
Not much was known
about his background.

153
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:48,614
He appeared on the
Hollywood scene

154
00:14:48,647 --> 00:14:51,383
out of the blue
with a lot of juice.

155
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:53,851
He was Russian, maybe Ukrainian.

156
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:57,155
He could've been
from Long Island.

157
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:01,926
Some called him a fixer,
most just called him.

cars, politics.

159
00:15:05,897 --> 00:15:08,900
They said if he entered a
revolving door behind you,

160
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:10,636
he would come out
in front of you.

161
00:15:11,903 --> 00:15:14,540
Why he was calling
me I didn't know,

162
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:15,940
but he was calling me.

163
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,478
It couldn't hurt to meet
and see what he was cooking.

164
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:23,314
All right, okay,
well, we're here.

182
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,287
"I Accuse."

183
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:38,524
It's very powerful stuff.

184
00:16:38,557 --> 00:16:41,092
You have a wonderful
touch for humanity.

185
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,994
It's in all of your films.

186
00:16:43,027 --> 00:16:44,730
These are troubling times,

187
00:16:44,763 --> 00:16:46,230
and I thought I had
to do something.

188
00:16:46,264 --> 00:16:48,900
Yes, yes, these
are very bad times.

189
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:51,069
But it give me an idea.

190
00:16:51,102 --> 00:16:53,104
[Charlie] What do
you have in mind?

191
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,808
What do you know
about John T. Conover?

192
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,010
- The reclusive billionaire?
- Yes, him.

193
00:16:59,043 --> 00:17:01,647
Hasn't been seen for a
decade, not even privately.

194
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,981
He's a ghost, a myth.

195
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:05,718
Yes, exactly.

196
00:17:05,751 --> 00:17:07,419
Would you like to interview him?

197
00:17:07,453 --> 00:17:08,520
[Charlie] How much?

198
00:17:08,554 --> 00:17:10,988
[Boris] Oh, a man of commerce.

199
00:17:11,022 --> 00:17:12,256
Just like you, Boris.

200
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,460
If you don't pay me,
you'll never respect me.

201
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:15,828
Very true statement.

202
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,864
Let's say that my associates,
they're very interested

203
00:17:19,897 --> 00:17:22,368
in bringing his
story to the screen.

204
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:24,737
And you would have to go
find him all by yourself.

205
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,505
A documentary?

206
00:17:26,538 --> 00:17:29,207
Would 50,000 be acceptable?

207
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,075
[Charlie] What are
my time constraints?

208
00:17:31,109 --> 00:17:33,010
Immediacy is very important.

209
00:17:34,312 --> 00:17:37,649
So you want me to find a guy
that doesn't wanna be found,

210
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:40,519
get him to agree to be
filmed for an interview

211
00:17:40,552 --> 00:17:43,888
when he hasn't let anyone
take his picture in a decade,

212
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:45,391
just like that?

213
00:17:45,424 --> 00:17:46,991
I see your point.

214
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:50,228
The money will be pay
or play, guaranteed.

215
00:17:52,598 --> 00:17:53,766
A 100 grand

216
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,503
in escrow and I have final cut.

217
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:59,103
I'll do you one better.

218
00:17:59,137 --> 00:18:02,408
I'll give you half
within 24 hours,

219
00:18:02,441 --> 00:18:04,041
the other half to be released

220
00:18:04,075 --> 00:18:06,612
when you deliver the interview.

221
00:18:06,645 --> 00:18:08,514
[Charlie] Just the interview
and not the whole film?

222
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:09,715
Exactly.

223
00:18:09,748 --> 00:18:10,915
That's odd, Boris.

224
00:18:10,948 --> 00:18:13,719
[Boris] Well I'm
a bit of an odd guy.

225
00:18:13,752 --> 00:18:14,620
Do we have a deal?

226
00:18:16,954 --> 00:18:19,658
If the money's there
tomorrow in certified funds

227
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:21,560
with a signed escrow agreement?

228
00:18:23,094 --> 00:18:24,596
Yeah, I'll play.

229
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,930
Excellent.

230
00:18:25,963 --> 00:18:28,099
I will have Natalie
bring your car around.

231
00:18:29,635 --> 00:18:32,103
Very nice doing business
with you, Charlie Nabis.

232
00:18:32,136 --> 00:18:33,539
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

233
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,283
It's pretty.

234
00:18:45,316 --> 00:18:46,785
It sure is.

235
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:49,788
Some advice?

236
00:18:49,822 --> 00:18:50,622
What?

237
00:18:51,457 --> 00:18:53,024
If you write a powerful letter

238
00:18:53,057 --> 00:18:54,927
about why you want
to interview him,

239
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,829
we can get it to someone.

240
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:58,730
Who knows?

241
00:18:59,832 --> 00:19:01,733
Sounds like a scheme.

242
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:05,069
[phone chimes]

243
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,103
Your car is here.

244
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:19,952
You look familiar.

245
00:19:19,984 --> 00:19:21,118
You make movies?

246
00:19:21,152 --> 00:19:23,054
Sometimes.

247
00:19:23,087 --> 00:19:24,356
[Driver] You direct?

248
00:19:24,389 --> 00:19:27,493
I have been known to direct
traffic from time to time.

249
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:29,795
Wise Water?

250
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:30,963
[Charlie] No thanks.

251
00:19:32,764 --> 00:19:34,967
Are you a Trump fan?

252
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:37,603
He's fantastic.

253
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:40,873
The guy's basically running
the country, you know?

254
00:19:40,906 --> 00:19:43,475
Sometimes in D.C.,
sometimes he's in Florida.

255
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:46,310
[Charlie Voiceover] What the
hell did I just say yes to?

256
00:19:47,546 --> 00:19:48,614
What can I say?

257
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:49,848
Money talks.

258
00:19:49,882 --> 00:19:52,149
I could live off
of that for a year.

259
00:19:52,183 --> 00:19:53,685
Another fucking year.

260
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:55,754
Trump's notifications
ready to go,

261
00:19:55,787 --> 00:19:57,021
so that way any time he tweets,

262
00:19:57,054 --> 00:19:59,090
I can always just
see what he's up to.

263
00:19:59,123 --> 00:19:59,992
You know, I love his tweets...

264
00:20:00,024 --> 00:20:02,260
From The Three Penny Opera,

265
00:20:02,293 --> 00:20:06,097
first feed the face, then
choose right or wrong.

266
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,333
Brecht, you are my absolver!

267
00:20:11,703 --> 00:20:14,873
How do you find a man who
doesn't want to be found?

268
00:20:16,742 --> 00:20:18,175
You don't.

269
00:20:18,209 --> 00:20:20,345
You find a way to
be found by him.

270
00:20:21,312 --> 00:20:24,081
[inspiring music]

271
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:34,660
Hey, it's Charlie Nabis,
how you doing, man?

272
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:36,895
I'm doing this really
interesting project

273
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:38,597
about John Conover.

274
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,532
I was thinking maybe you
could give me some ideas

275
00:20:40,566 --> 00:20:41,800
on where I might look.

276
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:44,836
Hi, my name is Charlie Nabis.

277
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:48,840
I'd like to speak to Efraim,

278
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:51,710
but I'm making a movie
about John Conover,

279
00:20:51,743 --> 00:20:53,545
Who used to work for him.

280
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:56,147
I was wondering if maybe
he could give me some ideas

281
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,583
on where I might find him.

282
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,019
[dial tone beeps]

283
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:01,820
Oh.

284
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:12,229
But you used to represent him.

285
00:21:12,263 --> 00:21:13,130
Any ideas?

286
00:21:18,704 --> 00:21:20,606
Tell me about that.

287
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:22,239
All right, well that helps.

288
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,752
Someone told me he
used to go to that club

289
00:21:33,785 --> 00:21:35,286
and hide out in the back.

290
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,257
Okay.

291
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,125
So it's true.

292
00:22:02,848 --> 00:22:05,216
You're in the
spotlight now, baby!

293
00:22:05,249 --> 00:22:06,585
Be great immediately.

294
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,293
[audience applauds]

295
00:22:16,328 --> 00:22:17,329
Thank you.

296
00:22:17,362 --> 00:22:20,432
Hi, I'm Charlie Nabis,
the sit down comic.

297
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:22,299
How you all doing tonight?

298
00:22:22,334 --> 00:22:26,138
You know, sometimes
I practice law.

299
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,273
A lot of people ask me do I
practice entertainment law.

300
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:33,244
I tell them, some folks
actually find me entertaining.

301
00:22:33,277 --> 00:22:36,348
[woman laughs]

302
00:22:36,381 --> 00:22:38,282
people see me dressed like this,

303
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,951
and when I tell
'em I'm a lawyer,

304
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:42,286
they say, "Are you
still practicing?"

305
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,188
And I say, "You know, one day

306
00:22:44,221 --> 00:22:46,458
"I'm get it perfect and retire."

307
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:49,761
You know, this is how
you get to Carnegie Hall.

308
00:22:49,795 --> 00:22:53,398
Practice, practice, practice.

309
00:22:53,432 --> 00:22:55,266
So I was at a party
the other night,

310
00:22:55,299 --> 00:22:59,004
and the woman who was
the host says to me,

311
00:22:59,037 --> 00:23:01,940
"You know, we really enjoyed
your company the other night."

312
00:23:01,973 --> 00:23:03,675
And I said, "Well,
how could you do that?

313
00:23:03,709 --> 00:23:05,177
"I haven't formed it yet."

314
00:23:07,913 --> 00:23:10,314
There's a reason they call
me the sit down comic.

315
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:12,384
Because every time I
try and tell a joke,

316
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:16,154
people say, "Sit
down, sit down."

317
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:21,292
You know, in addition
to entertainment law,

318
00:23:21,325 --> 00:23:24,196
there's an area of law
called intellectual property,

319
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:28,232
copyrights, trademarks,
patents, trade secrets.

320
00:23:28,265 --> 00:23:29,835
We call it IP.

321
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:33,038
And I'm at a party the
other night, a reception,

322
00:23:33,071 --> 00:23:35,272
and I'm talking to
this woman lawyer,

323
00:23:35,306 --> 00:23:38,376
and I say to her, "Well, what
kind of law do you practice?"

324
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,512
And she said, "Soft IP."

325
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:44,483
I said, "Oh, oh, soft
IP, that's great.

326
00:23:44,516 --> 00:23:48,252
"If you get hit in the head
with soft IP, you're okay."

327
00:23:48,285 --> 00:23:50,321
Everyone stays away
from the hard IP.

328
00:23:50,355 --> 00:23:51,389
Let me tell ya.

329
00:23:51,423 --> 00:23:53,759
You get hit in the
head with hard IP,

330
00:23:53,792 --> 00:23:56,695
the concussion
protocol is killer.

331
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:58,262
They take you out of
the game right away.

332
00:23:58,295 --> 00:24:01,066
They sit you down in front
of judges and doctors,

333
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:03,702
and they make you answer
these funny questions.

334
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:05,904
And you're out of the game.

335
00:24:05,937 --> 00:24:06,738
Sit down.

336
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,408
Bingo, we got a winner,
ladies and gentlemen.

337
00:24:10,442 --> 00:24:13,945
Sir, can I interest you
in a run for Congress?

338
00:24:14,946 --> 00:24:18,416
No, no, you're not interested?

339
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,317
Keeping your options
open, are you?

340
00:24:21,486 --> 00:24:23,755
Well, speaking of politics,

341
00:24:23,789 --> 00:24:26,458
there've been a lot
of protests lately.

342
00:24:26,491 --> 00:24:30,061
And a lot of people say
protesting doesn't work,

343
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:32,464
but you know, I
remember the days

344
00:24:32,497 --> 00:24:34,065
when George Bush was president.

345
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:35,333
You all remember that, right?

346
00:24:35,367 --> 00:24:36,935
[crowd boos]

347
00:24:36,968 --> 00:24:38,837
Right, so there were a
lot of protests then too,

348
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,939
and I remember the chants.

349
00:24:40,972 --> 00:24:42,607
No more Bush!

350
00:24:42,641 --> 00:24:44,442
No more Bush!

351
00:24:44,476 --> 00:24:46,310
No more Bush!

352
00:24:46,344 --> 00:24:49,381
No more Bush!

353
00:24:49,414 --> 00:24:52,083
And I gotta tell you,
I think it worked.

354
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:54,419
Have you seen the
internet lately?

355
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:56,721
I can't find bush anywhere.

356
00:24:56,755 --> 00:24:59,291
[women laughing]

357
00:24:59,323 --> 00:25:02,260
[crowd cheering]

358
00:25:05,363 --> 00:25:06,865
All right, folks.

359
00:25:06,898 --> 00:25:07,732
Thank you.

360
00:25:07,766 --> 00:25:09,434
I see my time's up.

361
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:11,503
You've been great.

362
00:25:11,536 --> 00:25:12,971
[soft music]

363
00:25:13,004 --> 00:25:16,007
[singer vocalizing]

364
00:25:19,778 --> 00:25:20,946
I must know your name.

365
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,381
Why?

366
00:25:23,415 --> 00:25:24,916
Because you're the
prettiest woman I've seen

367
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,251
in a really long time.

368
00:25:27,385 --> 00:25:28,653
Bull.

369
00:25:28,687 --> 00:25:30,355
But the the march
of time begs the voice

370
00:25:30,388 --> 00:25:32,457
and utterance of my tongue.

371
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,359
In this fleeting
grasp of a moment,

372
00:25:34,392 --> 00:25:38,363
let me not forever ask, "What
if I had just asked her name?"

373
00:25:41,967 --> 00:25:42,734
I'm America.

374
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:45,570
Really?

375
00:25:45,604 --> 00:25:46,404
Charlie.

376
00:25:47,873 --> 00:25:50,343
What were your parents
smoking when they named you?

377
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:54,880
They were very proud and
happy to be here in America.

378
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:58,483
Can I entice you
for a beverage?

379
00:26:00,118 --> 00:26:03,421
It's true, I will die, but
for the lack of thy love

380
00:26:03,455 --> 00:26:05,358
by the heavens, no.

381
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,325
Shakespeare, really?

382
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,593
You're quoting Shakespeare?

383
00:26:08,627 --> 00:26:10,363
Come, you're a muse of fire.

384
00:26:10,395 --> 00:26:12,964
Let us ascend to the heavens.

385
00:26:12,998 --> 00:26:14,733
Does this ever work?

386
00:26:14,766 --> 00:26:16,735
I don't know, that was the
first time I've tried it.

387
00:26:16,768 --> 00:26:17,802
How am I doing?

388
00:26:17,836 --> 00:26:18,803
Sit down.

389
00:26:18,837 --> 00:26:21,006
[laughs] Touche.

390
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,407
Well played, well played.

391
00:26:24,409 --> 00:26:25,944
Coffee.

392
00:26:25,977 --> 00:26:28,546
[Charlie] So let it be
written, so let it be done.

395
00:27:56,835 --> 00:27:59,237
America, she was a surprise.

396
00:28:04,377 --> 00:28:05,677
I made my move.

397
00:28:07,712 --> 00:28:09,448
The game had begun.

398
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:17,522
Now the dharma wheels turn.

399
00:28:17,555 --> 00:28:19,124
Planets align.

400
00:28:23,396 --> 00:28:26,798
Be patient, the dawn is coming.

Hey, it's Charlie,
the sit down comic.

406
00:30:03,828 --> 00:30:04,963
How are you?

407
00:30:04,996 --> 00:30:09,568
[laughs] I'm better now.

408
00:30:09,602 --> 00:30:11,669
Your film made me cry.

409
00:30:11,703 --> 00:30:13,339
Well then, I
guess I did my job.

410
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,446
Hello?

411
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:21,679
I'm here, Charlie.

412
00:30:21,713 --> 00:30:23,248
Oh, I thought I lost you.

413
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,085
No, you haven't lost me.

414
00:30:33,459 --> 00:30:37,662
Charlie, I need you right now.

415
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,798
Do you want me to come over?

416
00:30:42,834 --> 00:30:44,836
- Yes.
- Half an hour?

417
00:30:45,837 --> 00:30:46,738
Perfect.

418
00:30:46,771 --> 00:30:49,073
I'll text you the address.

419
00:30:49,107 --> 00:30:50,643
See you soon.

422
00:31:42,595 --> 00:31:43,362
I need to sit.

423
00:31:48,567 --> 00:31:49,335
Are you okay?

424
00:31:50,703 --> 00:31:52,003
Uh-huh.

425
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:54,373
I bet I can make
your face tingle

426
00:31:54,406 --> 00:31:56,074
without ever touching you.

427
00:31:56,107 --> 00:31:58,243
[laughs] Bull.

428
00:31:59,077 --> 00:32:00,613
No, I'm serious.

429
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:06,585
Just relax.

430
00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:07,986
Close your eyes.

431
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:10,723
Okay, but no
funny stuff, okay.

432
00:32:10,755 --> 00:32:12,725
- I'm serious.
- Okay, okay.

433
00:32:12,757 --> 00:32:14,993
And no matter what
you hear, just relax.

How did you do that?

437
00:32:35,648 --> 00:32:36,448
It's magic.

438
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:54,932
The moment my helmet
light hit you,

439
00:32:54,966 --> 00:32:56,335
you slayed me with your smile.

440
00:32:57,603 --> 00:32:59,405
You just wanted to get laid.

441
00:33:00,472 --> 00:33:01,272
Come on.

442
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:03,509
Sorry.

443
00:33:05,744 --> 00:33:09,047
I just wanted to be loved

444
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,916
and touched and desired.

445
00:33:16,355 --> 00:33:18,956
And you're charming when the
light hits you just right.

446
00:33:21,926 --> 00:33:23,928
And then there's
your magical fingers.

to be a great time

will win, win, win!

We will unite and we
will win, win, win!

to be a great time

We will unite and we
will win, win, win!

[camera shutter clicking]

462
00:34:44,108 --> 00:34:45,910
Dear Mr. Conover.

463
00:34:45,943 --> 00:34:48,980
My name is Charlie
Nabis, I am a filmmaker.

464
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:53,017
As a means of introduction you
might be interested to know

465
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,986
that I have been shot at twice,

466
00:34:55,019 --> 00:34:57,021
have traveled to
Mt. Fuji in Japan

467
00:34:57,054 --> 00:35:01,560
on a Buddhist pilgrimage,
and when I was 14,

468
00:35:01,593 --> 00:35:03,127
I was very sick.

469
00:35:03,161 --> 00:35:05,597
I stood almost six feet tall

470
00:35:05,631 --> 00:35:08,500
but weighed only 69 pounds.

471
00:35:08,534 --> 00:35:10,436
I was given a few hours to live.

472
00:35:12,538 --> 00:35:15,707
While this has some bearing
on the reason for this letter,

473
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:18,242
it also gives you a
window to my soul.

474
00:35:18,276 --> 00:35:20,446
It's why I make movies.

475
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:23,782
I believe you have an
interesting story to tell.

476
00:35:23,816 --> 00:35:26,050
I'd like to be the
one to tell it.

477
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:26,852
Can we meet?

478
00:35:27,653 --> 00:35:29,488
Sincerely, Charlie.

479
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:04,356
Holy crap.

480
00:36:04,389 --> 00:36:05,624
How'd I miss that?

481
00:36:10,829 --> 00:36:12,364
Holy shit.

482
00:36:13,632 --> 00:36:15,199
Holy shit.

483
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:42,394
Mr. Conover?

484
00:36:59,243 --> 00:37:03,348
Whoa, thanks for
agreeing to meet with me.

485
00:37:03,382 --> 00:37:06,018
You are an interesting
man, Mr. Nabis.

486
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:08,119
I like to meet
interesting people.

487
00:37:08,152 --> 00:37:11,957
Once upon a time, I
used to collect them.

488
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,025
No more?

489
00:37:13,057 --> 00:37:15,192
Firing away from
the get-go I see.

490
00:37:15,226 --> 00:37:16,762
Just curious.

491
00:37:16,795 --> 00:37:21,065
Ah, that crazy little
thing that kills cats, huh?

492
00:37:22,266 --> 00:37:24,036
Why'd you have me
come in the back way?

493
00:37:24,068 --> 00:37:26,237
Privacy, security.

494
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,040
And of course, as a test.

495
00:37:28,072 --> 00:37:29,508
Did I pass the test?

496
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:31,108
We're still
talking, aren't we?

497
00:37:32,276 --> 00:37:34,546
Any more tests headed my way?

498
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,815
Will they be open
book, multiple guess?

499
00:37:38,249 --> 00:37:39,751
[Mr. Conover] Possibly.

500
00:37:39,785 --> 00:37:41,853
I mean, we're all
tested, aren't we?

501
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:42,754
How so?

502
00:37:42,788 --> 00:37:44,088
Oh, come on now, Charlie.

503
00:37:44,121 --> 00:37:45,490
I mean, I can call
you Charlie, yes?

504
00:37:45,524 --> 00:37:47,359
[Charlie] Sure,
can I call you John?

505
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,894
Sure.

506
00:37:48,927 --> 00:37:50,629
Jack if you wind up liking me.

507
00:37:52,397 --> 00:37:55,567
You know the test that
every living being faces,

508
00:37:55,601 --> 00:37:57,201
the struggle to survive,

509
00:37:57,234 --> 00:38:01,272
to thrive, advance,

510
00:38:01,305 --> 00:38:04,876
overcome, manage, pacify,

511
00:38:06,044 --> 00:38:06,812
motivate.

512
00:38:08,947 --> 00:38:11,282
The stuff of your
movies and books.

513
00:38:11,315 --> 00:38:13,085
You've seen my films?

514
00:38:13,117 --> 00:38:14,886
You think it was
that cute little letter

515
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,556
from Boris that put
you in front of me?

516
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:18,590
That was part of it,

517
00:38:20,224 --> 00:38:25,196
but the reason I wanted
to meet you was America.

518
00:38:26,297 --> 00:38:27,599
I'm not sure I understand.

519
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,234
You don't understand?

520
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:31,503
No.

521
00:38:31,536 --> 00:38:34,373
No, what's my personal
life got to do with you?

522
00:38:34,406 --> 00:38:36,908
America's wellbeing
is of concern to me.

523
00:38:38,242 --> 00:38:42,981
I've taken it upon myself to
keep a watchful eye on her.

524
00:38:43,015 --> 00:38:44,082
She's a grown woman.

525
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:45,384
Do you really think

526
00:38:45,417 --> 00:38:47,119
the sugar daddy routine's
gonna work with her?

527
00:38:47,151 --> 00:38:50,822
[laughs] Now you're
being insolent.

528
00:38:50,856 --> 00:38:52,223
I am no one's fool, Mr. Nabis.

529
00:38:54,593 --> 00:38:56,628
The proximity of your
tryst with America

530
00:38:56,662 --> 00:38:59,296
and that sycophantic
joke of a letter you sent

531
00:38:59,331 --> 00:39:00,532
is not lost on me.

532
00:39:02,334 --> 00:39:03,468
You're just using her.

533
00:39:05,037 --> 00:39:07,304
Well, my plan
worked, didn't it?

534
00:39:07,339 --> 00:39:10,642
I mean, here I am talking
to the ghost, the myth

535
00:39:10,676 --> 00:39:13,277
that is John T. Conover,

536
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:16,715
the man gone 10 years without
a confirmed public sighting,

537
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:19,216
aren't I?

538
00:39:26,892 --> 00:39:28,894
I didn't expect to
be thunderstruck.

539
00:39:31,797 --> 00:39:33,532
She swept me off my feet.

540
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:36,401
I wouldn't hurt her.

541
00:39:37,569 --> 00:39:38,603
Does she know this?

542
00:39:42,607 --> 00:39:44,241
Look, she means
something to me.

543
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,079
I don't know how it's gonna go.

544
00:39:48,346 --> 00:39:50,148
But right now, she's
more important to me

545
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:51,083
than this gig.

546
00:39:52,249 --> 00:39:53,351
So I tell you what.

547
00:39:54,653 --> 00:39:57,889
Why don't we just pretend
this meeting never happened?

548
00:39:57,923 --> 00:39:59,591
I'll tell Boris
it was all a ruse,

549
00:40:00,726 --> 00:40:02,027
and that will be that.

550
00:40:03,428 --> 00:40:05,731
[soft music]

551
00:40:06,865 --> 00:40:07,599
You hear that?

552
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:12,236
[machinery creaking]

553
00:40:28,386 --> 00:40:30,422
That is the sound of money.

554
00:40:33,391 --> 00:40:34,559
Relentless, unrepentant,

555
00:40:36,728 --> 00:40:38,262
unfeeling, constant.

556
00:40:42,934 --> 00:40:47,439
Oh, the march of time has
you thinking, doesn't it?

557
00:40:52,811 --> 00:40:55,413
I have begun to question
the capitalist system

558
00:40:55,447 --> 00:40:58,483
on some of the choices
that I've made.

559
00:40:59,451 --> 00:41:00,519
The chimes at midnight.

560
00:41:05,322 --> 00:41:06,124
Possibly.

561
00:41:08,126 --> 00:41:10,595
You know, my film
would allow you

562
00:41:10,629 --> 00:41:13,932
to protect the way the world
sees you and your legacy.

563
00:41:13,965 --> 00:41:15,567
It would be in your own words.

564
00:41:17,903 --> 00:41:20,605
Life is a dream, but
movies are forever.

565
00:41:26,378 --> 00:41:28,680
I have nothing more
to say to you today.

566
00:41:34,853 --> 00:41:36,021
Are we square, Jack?

567
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,329
Great, I'll see myself out.

568
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:04,015
It's closed.

569
00:42:04,049 --> 00:42:05,450
Yeah, apparently.

570
00:42:07,385 --> 00:42:08,820
Oh.

571
00:42:08,854 --> 00:42:09,855
It's not a big deal.

572
00:42:09,888 --> 00:42:11,389
We can eat somewhere else.

573
00:42:13,525 --> 00:42:15,026
It was a favorite of mine.

574
00:42:16,695 --> 00:42:17,662
Their crab cakes.

575
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,032
[Charlie] America?

576
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,703
It's okay, I'm not
really that hungry.

577
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:26,371
I could eat.

578
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,475
Let's just go
for a walk, okay?

579
00:42:30,508 --> 00:42:31,309
Sure.

580
00:43:18,089 --> 00:43:18,890
- Hi.
- Hi.

581
00:43:28,967 --> 00:43:30,302
You met with Conover?

582
00:43:31,503 --> 00:43:33,271
Sorry, I should have told you.

583
00:43:35,206 --> 00:43:36,541
It's no skin off my ass.

584
00:43:38,076 --> 00:43:40,578
That man keeps trying to
insert himself in my life.

585
00:43:41,813 --> 00:43:44,816
Still I should have told you.

586
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:50,322
Things happened pretty
quick for us, didn't they?

587
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:54,559
His guilt runs deep.

588
00:43:58,029 --> 00:44:02,901
I used it for a while.

589
00:44:05,603 --> 00:44:06,571
Then it got sticky.

590
00:44:07,472 --> 00:44:08,573
So I moved on.

591
00:44:09,774 --> 00:44:10,575
He has not.

592
00:44:12,644 --> 00:44:14,413
Your uncle?

593
00:44:14,447 --> 00:44:15,246
Mm-hmm.

594
00:44:17,148 --> 00:44:18,516
Quite the character you are.

595
00:44:34,632 --> 00:44:36,267
Maybe it was too easy.

596
00:44:38,169 --> 00:44:41,172
They say when you're in
harmony with the universe,

597
00:44:42,107 --> 00:44:43,541
your fortune chases you.

598
00:44:46,311 --> 00:44:48,046
It was all going my way.

599
00:44:57,856 --> 00:44:58,990
[America laughs]

600
00:44:59,024 --> 00:45:00,359
Come on, I
gotcha, don't worry.

601
00:45:00,393 --> 00:45:01,192
Charlie?

602
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:05,331
Surprise, tango anyone?

603
00:45:05,364 --> 00:45:06,965
Are you kidding me?

604
00:45:06,998 --> 00:45:07,866
Let's dance.

605
00:45:07,899 --> 00:45:09,734
Whoa, America?

606
00:45:10,668 --> 00:45:11,437
America.

607
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:16,074
America?

608
00:45:16,107 --> 00:45:19,277
Come on baby, wake up, wake up.

609
00:45:20,712 --> 00:45:23,681
[intense music]

610
00:45:23,715 --> 00:45:25,016
Yeah, I have an emergency.

611
00:45:25,884 --> 00:45:27,185
My girlfriend just fainted.

612
00:45:27,218 --> 00:45:30,021
I'm at Washington and
Boise in Culver City.

613
00:45:31,256 --> 00:45:32,323
I don't know, she just fainted.

614
00:45:32,358 --> 00:45:33,359
I need an ambulance.

615
00:45:33,392 --> 00:45:34,592
Come on, baby.

616
00:45:34,626 --> 00:45:35,760
Come on, wake up.

617
00:45:36,995 --> 00:45:37,762
Wake up.

[ambulance siren blares]

00:45:46,571 --> 00:45:49,274
Come on, wake up baby, wake up.

620
00:45:54,579 --> 00:45:55,580
Come on, the
ambulance is coming.

621
00:45:55,613 --> 00:45:57,048
You can hear it now.

622
00:45:57,082 --> 00:45:58,716
Ambulance is here.

623
00:46:04,557 --> 00:46:08,226
[Man On Radio] Yeah, Dr.
Cole gets out at 11:00 a.m.

624
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,115
Mr. Nabis?

625
00:46:30,148 --> 00:46:33,284
Hi, I'm Dr. Amira.

626
00:46:33,318 --> 00:46:34,085
You brought her in?

627
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:35,253
Is she okay?

628
00:46:35,286 --> 00:46:36,621
She's awake.

629
00:46:36,654 --> 00:46:39,124
Her cognitive functions
don't seem to be impaired.

630
00:46:39,958 --> 00:46:41,159
Well, what happened?

631
00:46:41,192 --> 00:46:43,828
She was dehydrated
and had low blood sugar.

632
00:46:43,862 --> 00:46:45,598
That's not uncommon for a person

633
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:47,866
with aggressive
non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

634
00:46:47,899 --> 00:46:49,134
Lymphoma?

635
00:46:49,167 --> 00:46:50,268
You didn't know, oh.

636
00:46:51,403 --> 00:46:52,637
I shouldn't have spoken.

637
00:46:54,005 --> 00:46:55,173
Off the record?

638
00:46:56,609 --> 00:46:59,944
Where she is now, the
chemo is not working.

639
00:46:59,978 --> 00:47:01,679
She needs a bone
marrow transplant.

640

Well, I don't know

641
00:47:06,651 --> 00:47:07,986
who her family is
or where they are.

642

We just started on our journey.

643
00:47:10,422 --> 00:47:11,756
It doesn't matter.

644
00:47:11,789 --> 00:47:14,560
As long as it's a match, it
could be anyone, even you.

645
00:47:14,593 --> 00:47:16,794
You wanna get me tested?

646
00:47:16,828 --> 00:47:19,664
She doesn't have much longer.

647
00:47:20,865 --> 00:47:23,268
If you're a match,
that's greater love.

648
00:47:23,301 --> 00:47:25,170
Well, can I see her?

649
00:47:25,203 --> 00:47:26,137
Visiting hours are over.

650
00:47:26,171 --> 00:47:28,340
So you won't have long with her.

651

you get in, okay?

652

I'm sorry.

Oh, come on now.

657
00:47:55,367 --> 00:47:57,902
Love means never having
to say you're sorry.

658
00:47:57,936 --> 00:47:59,572
You're horrible.

00:48:01,005 --> 00:48:03,041
I know, but I couldn't resist.

That restaurant, that was
special for you, wasn't it?

661
00:48:16,821 --> 00:48:18,323
I should have told you.

662
00:48:20,626 --> 00:48:22,961
You just scared
me, that's all.

663
00:48:22,994 --> 00:48:24,862
I'm actually gonna
see if I'm a match.

665

For I too have been
covered with thorns.

[America Voiceover]
You are away from me.

673

There's a window open
from my heart to yours.

674

From this window, like the moon

675

There is one kiss we want

and say no more.

Because of love,

sweet to meet me for drinks.

Are you excited about
interviewing Conover?

It hasn't happened yet.

It will.

Anyway, I like talking to you.

690

I get to meet a
lot of famous people

and interesting people like you.

695
00:50:56,582 --> 00:50:57,915
I'm guessing you
know where a lot

of bodies are buried then, huh?

whatever do you mean?

really need taste

704

John, you haven't
been seen in public

721
00:52:26,438 --> 00:52:28,039
for almost 15 years.

722
00:52:28,072 --> 00:52:29,073
Where have you been?

723
00:52:30,975 --> 00:52:32,778
Out there.

724
00:52:32,811 --> 00:52:34,011
Why all the mystery?

725
00:52:34,045 --> 00:52:35,313
There's no mystery.

726
00:52:35,347 --> 00:52:38,983
I just didn't wanna be
in public life anymore.

727
00:52:39,016 --> 00:52:41,319
Was there a specific
event or incident

728
00:52:41,353 --> 00:52:42,421
that caused that to happen?

729
00:52:42,454 --> 00:52:43,388
Let me put it this way.

730
00:52:43,422 --> 00:52:45,089
Every time I went anywhere,

731
00:52:45,122 --> 00:52:46,859
people always had
their hand out.

732
00:52:46,892 --> 00:52:49,160
Politicians,
foundations, charities,

733
00:52:49,193 --> 00:52:50,995
meals, events.

734
00:52:51,028 --> 00:52:53,130
They all wanted a piece of me.

735
00:52:53,164 --> 00:52:55,434
And that just
wasn't fun anymore.

736
00:52:55,467 --> 00:52:57,336
You were able
to just walk away.

737
00:52:57,369 --> 00:52:58,269
Absolutely.

738
00:53:00,339 --> 00:53:04,610
I succeeded beyond my wildest
dreams with Wise Water.

739
00:53:05,944 --> 00:53:09,481
Did your time at sea
change your mind at all?

740
00:53:10,649 --> 00:53:13,117
Let me try to
paint you a picture.

741
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,087
Imagine it's midnight.

742
00:53:21,092 --> 00:53:23,729
There's a full moon with
only a few clouds in the sky.

743
00:53:25,196 --> 00:53:26,532
And you're at the helm.

744
00:53:26,565 --> 00:53:28,165
Your watch.

745
00:53:30,234 --> 00:53:31,770
And you look out
into that darkness

746
00:53:31,803 --> 00:53:33,037
that goes on forever.

747
00:53:35,072 --> 00:53:37,709
On a night like this, you
can see the silver surface

748
00:53:37,743 --> 00:53:42,179
of the ocean, the rock and roll
of the sea dances with you.

749
00:53:43,348 --> 00:53:44,248
You look up at the sky

750
00:53:44,282 --> 00:53:46,150
at the stars,

751
00:53:48,353 --> 00:53:50,722
and they're brilliant
and pristine.

752
00:53:55,226 --> 00:53:58,129
You feel like you're
one with the universe.

753
00:53:58,162 --> 00:53:59,898
It's like a satori experience.

754
00:54:01,265 --> 00:54:02,901
You are the world.

755
00:54:08,272 --> 00:54:10,141
And then you realize
you're alone.

756
00:54:12,143 --> 00:54:16,848
That if you got sick or hurt,

757
00:54:16,882 --> 00:54:18,182
there was no one to call.

758
00:54:19,418 --> 00:54:22,721
And you are humbled,

759
00:54:24,288 --> 00:54:28,360
fearful, and exalted,

760
00:54:28,393 --> 00:54:29,628
because you're in the presence

761
00:54:29,661 --> 00:54:31,863
of guess what, Charlie?

762
00:54:31,897 --> 00:54:32,764
What?

763
00:54:32,798 --> 00:54:35,132
Thou nature art my goddess.

764
00:54:36,267 --> 00:54:39,303
Brother, that's a force
to be reckoned with.

765
00:54:40,572 --> 00:54:43,174
Kind and gentle, and
then in an instant,

766
00:54:44,076 --> 00:54:45,444
furious and vengeful.

767
00:54:47,278 --> 00:54:49,246
Why would I wanna
be anywhere else?

768
00:54:50,082 --> 00:54:51,083
Why indeed?

769
00:54:51,148 --> 00:54:52,249
You know, there are some folks

770
00:54:52,283 --> 00:54:54,720
that wanna be rich and famous.

771
00:54:54,753 --> 00:54:56,955
I just want there to
be rich and anonymous.

772
00:54:59,057 --> 00:55:00,525
[Charlie] Do
you miss the game?

773
00:55:01,426 --> 00:55:02,928
There are characters that,

774
00:55:05,397 --> 00:55:07,899
there are characters around

775
00:55:07,933 --> 00:55:10,301
that have more money
than they can ever spend,

776
00:55:11,235 --> 00:55:12,537
and they wanna keep playing.

777
00:55:12,571 --> 00:55:14,873
You know, raping and pillaging
is a way of life to them.

778
00:55:14,906 --> 00:55:17,476
The thrill of winning big.

779
00:55:19,111 --> 00:55:20,779
It's addictive to some.

780
00:55:20,812 --> 00:55:21,613
Not to me.

781
00:55:25,984 --> 00:55:28,319
They add nothing to humanity.

782
00:55:28,353 --> 00:55:30,122
Is that important to you?

783
00:55:30,154 --> 00:55:31,790
It wasn't when I was young.

784
00:55:31,823 --> 00:55:36,628
See, to some extent, I just
wanted my piece of the pie.

785
00:55:37,629 --> 00:55:39,531
Well, I look at the world now,

786
00:55:41,165 --> 00:55:43,300
and there are problems
that can be solved.

787
00:55:45,537 --> 00:55:49,141
And we have the
money to solve them.

788
00:55:49,173 --> 00:55:53,979
And we can even get
wealthy solving them, see.

789
00:55:55,246 --> 00:55:58,215
This thing called greed, this
driving force of capitalism

790
00:55:58,249 --> 00:56:01,887
that sucks people in,
you see, they forget.

791
00:56:04,056 --> 00:56:05,724
It kills any chance.

792
00:56:10,227 --> 00:56:11,496
It's ugly out there.

793
00:56:13,732 --> 00:56:17,002
And if we don't solve it,
it's gonna get even uglier.

794
00:56:17,035 --> 00:56:18,336
Revolution?

795
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:19,471
[Mr. Conover] Perhaps.

796
00:56:20,372 --> 00:56:22,239
What would that solve?

797
00:56:22,273 --> 00:56:23,909
Everything, nothing.

798
00:56:27,211 --> 00:56:29,815
[ominous music]

799
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:41,193
Is that why you're
doing this interview?

800
00:56:41,225 --> 00:56:42,494
In part.

801
00:56:42,527 --> 00:56:44,029
[Charlie] What's
the other part?

802
00:56:47,365 --> 00:56:48,667
You tell me. [laughs]

803
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:49,401
Come on, Jack.

804
00:56:49,434 --> 00:56:50,669
You wasting my time?

805
00:56:50,702 --> 00:56:52,437
That's not my
intent, believe me.

806
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:00,412
Tell me about Adam Afrides.

807
00:57:02,848 --> 00:57:04,149
What would you like to know?

808
00:57:04,182 --> 00:57:05,383
[Charlie] How did he die?

809
00:57:07,284 --> 00:57:10,422
I see we're going into
all corners of my life.

810
00:57:10,455 --> 00:57:13,191
[Charlie] Yes, you knew
that when we started.

811
00:57:13,225 --> 00:57:14,626
Did you set him up?

812
00:57:14,659 --> 00:57:15,927
Excuse me?

813
00:57:15,961 --> 00:57:17,863
The Wall Street
Journal reported

814
00:57:17,896 --> 00:57:20,832
that you tried to buy him
out, you were partners.

815
00:57:20,866 --> 00:57:23,568
We just started going in
different directions, that's all.

816
00:57:23,602 --> 00:57:25,302
He fought you,
you wouldn't sell.

817
00:57:26,838 --> 00:57:29,174
When that happened,
what did you do?

818
00:57:29,207 --> 00:57:31,443
[Mr. Conover] I'm not
understanding your question.

819
00:57:31,476 --> 00:57:34,713
All of a sudden,
he's found unconscious,

820
00:57:34,746 --> 00:57:37,382
naked, with an underage girl

821
00:57:37,415 --> 00:57:39,584
in a cheap motel
room in Calabasas.

822
00:57:40,652 --> 00:57:43,287
He's arrested on
statutory rape charges.

823
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,690
That was a very
sad turn of events.

824
00:57:46,925 --> 00:57:48,493
You had nothing
to do with that?

825
00:57:49,728 --> 00:57:51,163
What should you say?

826
00:57:53,064 --> 00:57:54,399
He was gay.

827
00:57:54,432 --> 00:57:56,968
[Mr. Conover] I was as
shocked as anyone, okay.

828
00:57:57,002 --> 00:57:59,303
He sold you his
shares then, didn't he?

829
00:57:59,337 --> 00:58:00,772
We reached an agreement, yes.

830
00:58:03,175 --> 00:58:06,111
[mysterious music]

831
00:58:09,347 --> 00:58:12,517
[Charlie] Tell
me about your son.

832
00:58:18,089 --> 00:58:18,957
He was troubled.

833
00:58:20,091 --> 00:58:21,560
[Charlie] He agreed
to wear a wire.

834
00:58:21,593 --> 00:58:23,228
The Kern County
District Attorney

835
00:58:23,261 --> 00:58:26,498
was investigating the Planning
Commissioners for corruption.

836
00:58:26,531 --> 00:58:28,600
You worked very closely
with Rex Hernandez,

837
00:58:28,633 --> 00:58:29,768
the head commissioner.

838
00:58:31,703 --> 00:58:32,838
I did.

839
00:58:32,871 --> 00:58:36,508
In fact, you
donated over $250,000

840
00:58:36,541 --> 00:58:39,511
in campaign contributions
to his and his associates.

841
00:58:39,544 --> 00:58:40,712
You...

842
00:58:43,048 --> 00:58:44,749
Look, I don't know
the exact number,

843
00:58:44,783 --> 00:58:46,451
but you have to protect
your interests, don't you?

844
00:58:46,484 --> 00:58:48,420
Oh, I understand.

845
00:58:48,453 --> 00:58:50,422
Rex Hernandez is in jail now.

846
00:58:50,455 --> 00:58:53,825
And the district attorney,
he wanted you there as well.

847
00:58:53,859 --> 00:58:55,360
Possibly.

848
00:58:55,393 --> 00:58:58,096
But as you can see,
I am not in jail.

849
00:58:58,129 --> 00:58:59,464
Your son was ratting on you.

850
00:58:59,497 --> 00:59:02,500
Drugs put him in the
position of vulnerability.

851
00:59:02,534 --> 00:59:04,169
Okay no, there was
no ratting out.

852
00:59:05,237 --> 00:59:06,605
My son was sick.

853
00:59:06,638 --> 00:59:08,106
He was troubled, as I said.

854
00:59:09,374 --> 00:59:13,078
[Charlie] On November
6th, 2004, he took a shotgun

855
00:59:14,347 --> 00:59:17,350
and committed suicide
at his Las Vegas home.

856
00:59:17,382 --> 00:59:22,087
His funeral was the last
time you were seen in public.

857
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:27,926
Do you know why I'm having
the success that I am, Charlie?

858
00:59:29,561 --> 00:59:31,897
Because even though I
wanted my piece of the pie,

859
00:59:33,765 --> 00:59:35,233
I also knew that whatever I did

860
00:59:35,267 --> 00:59:37,102
I had to be of
service to humanity.

861
00:59:38,337 --> 00:59:40,605
My time in the peace
corps showed me that.

862
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:44,175
Politicians had us all believing

863
00:59:44,209 --> 00:59:48,580
that we were the great
white American hope come

864
00:59:48,613 --> 00:59:51,384
to teach the world's poor.

865
00:59:55,887 --> 00:59:56,655
No.

866
01:00:01,593 --> 01:00:02,661
The truth was I learned more

867
01:00:02,694 --> 01:00:05,563
from the people I
was trying to help

868
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,403
than they ever learned from me.

869
01:00:11,503 --> 01:00:13,471
What about your
company's water rights,

870
01:00:13,505 --> 01:00:16,274
the new find in
the central valley?

871
01:00:16,308 --> 01:00:17,542
Bingo!

872
01:00:17,575 --> 01:00:19,077
Now you're talking, Charlie.

873
01:00:20,445 --> 01:00:22,280
[Charlie] Are you
selling to the Russians?

874
01:00:22,314 --> 01:00:23,581
Hell no.

875
01:00:23,615 --> 01:00:25,050
Come on, that's a
lot of bullshit.

876
01:00:25,083 --> 01:00:27,118
Then what will
happen to the water?

877
01:00:27,152 --> 01:00:29,120
Okay, well you see,
there you go, Charlie.

878
01:00:29,154 --> 01:00:30,588
It's the reason why I'm here.

879
01:00:31,623 --> 01:00:32,590
And not out there.

880
01:00:33,658 --> 01:00:34,659
Because I want,

881
01:00:37,295 --> 01:00:38,863
what I'm trying to
do is I'm trying

882
01:00:38,897 --> 01:00:40,433
to set up a trust to
hold the water rights,

883
01:00:40,465 --> 01:00:43,134
so that the farmers can
use them when they need it.

884
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:46,938
The rights can never
be used privately

885
01:00:46,972 --> 01:00:49,774
or for profit.

886
01:00:49,808 --> 01:00:50,575
Wow.

887
01:00:52,777 --> 01:00:54,646
Isn't that where you
bottle your product?

888
01:00:54,679 --> 01:00:56,449
We purchase water
rights over the years

889
01:00:56,481 --> 01:00:58,249
and have plants
all over the world.

890
01:00:58,283 --> 01:00:59,452
So not so much anymore.

891
01:00:59,484 --> 01:01:01,953
What about your board,
your shareholders?

892
01:01:06,691 --> 01:01:08,326
Since I'm the
majority shareholder,

893
01:01:08,361 --> 01:01:10,261
I don't think it's
gonna be a problem.

894
01:01:10,295 --> 01:01:11,930
That's very noble of you.

895
01:01:11,963 --> 01:01:13,965
It looks that way, doesn't it?

896
01:01:13,999 --> 01:01:15,266
I'm just here to give back.

897
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,135
That's what being
out there taught me.

898
01:01:20,572 --> 01:01:23,641
You do understand this
is all very confidential?

899
01:01:23,675 --> 01:01:24,809
But what about my film?

900
01:01:26,044 --> 01:01:27,278
It'll all be worked out

901
01:01:27,312 --> 01:01:29,781
and announced before
you're finished editing.

902
01:01:29,814 --> 01:01:31,716
I don't really
have a choice, do I?

903
01:01:33,251 --> 01:01:34,453
No, you don't.

904
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,788
What do you say we
adjourn for today?

905
01:01:38,023 --> 01:01:39,691
I knew you were the
right man for the job.

906
01:01:42,727 --> 01:01:44,529
Hey Boris, it's Charlie.

907
01:01:44,562 --> 01:01:47,466
I just shot John T. Conover,

908
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,968
my first interview with him.

909
01:01:50,001 --> 01:01:51,169
Wow.

910
01:01:51,202 --> 01:01:52,570
All right, we're
gonna do another one.

911
01:01:52,604 --> 01:01:54,539
I'll let you know when.

912
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:14,859
No! [man grunting]

918
01:02:47,759 --> 01:02:51,629
Yes, yes, I understand.

919
01:02:53,131 --> 01:02:55,233
I thought you told me it
wouldn't be a big deal

920
01:02:55,266 --> 01:02:56,201
to find a donor.

921
01:03:00,772 --> 01:03:02,541
Okay.

922
01:03:02,575 --> 01:03:03,375
Okay.

923
01:03:14,686 --> 01:03:17,622

924
01:03:17,655 --> 01:03:18,591
America.

925
01:03:18,623 --> 01:03:19,624
Charlie?

926
01:03:22,528 --> 01:03:24,062
They can't find a donor for me.

927
01:03:25,663 --> 01:03:27,765
Okay, okay.

928
01:03:27,799 --> 01:03:28,633
Don't panic.

929
01:03:29,901 --> 01:03:31,337
I'm gonna go get tested today,

930
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:32,471
see if I'm a match.

931
01:03:32,505 --> 01:03:34,072
We'll find a way, Amber Waves.

932
01:03:34,105 --> 01:03:35,773
Okay.

933
01:03:35,807 --> 01:03:38,477
[Charlie] Can I
get you anything?

934
01:03:38,511 --> 01:03:40,346
Get me a donor match.

935
01:03:46,684 --> 01:03:48,786
I don't know what to say.

936
01:03:50,822 --> 01:03:51,856
I don't know.

937
01:03:56,261 --> 01:03:57,996
I'm afraid.

938
01:03:58,029 --> 01:03:58,830
Me too.

939
01:04:00,499 --> 01:04:02,300
Let me get tested.

940
01:04:02,334 --> 01:04:03,668
Stay positive, yes?

941
01:04:06,037 --> 01:04:06,838
Yes.

942
01:04:16,415 --> 01:04:19,851
[phone ringing]

943
01:04:19,884 --> 01:04:21,319
Go for Charlie.

944
01:04:21,353 --> 01:04:23,855
[Natalie] Mr. Nabis, I
have Mr. Levashov for you.

945
01:04:23,888 --> 01:04:24,789
Please hold.

946
01:04:24,822 --> 01:04:26,425
Charlie, you motherfucker.

947
01:04:26,458 --> 01:04:28,627
You said you would call
as soon as you were done.

948
01:04:28,661 --> 01:04:30,563
[Charlie] What the fuck
are you talking about?

949
01:04:30,596 --> 01:04:32,531
I left you a voicemail message.

950
01:04:32,565 --> 01:04:33,332
Didn't you get it?

951
01:04:33,365 --> 01:04:34,799
Do not curse at me.

952
01:04:34,832 --> 01:04:36,100
Don't you call
me a motherfucker,

953
01:04:36,134 --> 01:04:37,670
the first words
out of your mouth.

954
01:04:37,702 --> 01:04:39,672
You work for me!

955
01:04:39,704 --> 01:04:41,072
Listen Boris, I
don't have the time

956
01:04:41,105 --> 01:04:41,973
for your shit right now.

957
01:04:42,006 --> 01:04:43,509
My girlfriend's dying.

958
01:04:43,542 --> 01:04:45,377
No joke, she's dying.

959
01:04:45,411 --> 01:04:47,812
I have to get tested to
see if I'm a donor match.

960
01:04:47,845 --> 01:04:50,683
I need to see the
footage that you shot.

961
01:04:50,715 --> 01:04:53,051
Did you not hear
what I just said?

962
01:04:53,084 --> 01:04:56,287
My girlfriend is
dying, you fuck.

Boris?

966
01:05:05,664 --> 01:05:06,898
[Natalie] Mr. Nabis, I
have Mr. Levashov for you.

967
01:05:06,931 --> 01:05:08,534
- Please hold.
- Hello.

968
01:05:08,567 --> 01:05:11,269
Look, I'm on my way to the
oncologist's office right now.

969
01:05:11,302 --> 01:05:12,870
Are you gonna be civil?

970
01:05:12,904 --> 01:05:15,273
Look, I am sorry to hear
about your girlfriend.

971
01:05:15,306 --> 01:05:17,775
When you get time, I
need to see the footage

972
01:05:17,809 --> 01:05:18,810
that you shot.

973
01:05:18,843 --> 01:05:20,211
It's very important.

974
01:05:20,245 --> 01:05:22,046
Okay, okay, I promise.

975
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,249
I'll get it to you
as soon as I can.

976
01:05:24,282 --> 01:05:25,083
Stay tuned.

977
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:38,896

01:06:11,095 --> 01:06:11,863
What the?

980
01:06:13,998 --> 01:06:15,266
- Doc?
- It's important.

981
01:06:19,037 --> 01:06:20,706
You're a match.

982
01:06:20,739 --> 01:06:22,775
That is good news, but you
coulda just sent me an email

983
01:06:22,807 --> 01:06:24,075
or called me.

984
01:06:24,108 --> 01:06:26,478
Also, I want you to
know the risks involved

985
01:06:26,512 --> 01:06:27,278
in being a donor.

986
01:06:27,312 --> 01:06:28,913
There are risks?

987
01:06:28,946 --> 01:06:30,549
What are they?

988
01:06:30,582 --> 01:06:32,484
We'd start with a
series of injections

989
01:06:32,518 --> 01:06:34,586
to boost your stem cell count.

990
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:37,489
There is a wrinkle and
a caution in your case.

991
01:06:37,523 --> 01:06:38,424
What's that?

992
01:06:38,457 --> 01:06:40,124
We'd have to use anesthesia.

993
01:06:40,158 --> 01:06:41,926
With your elevated
blood pressure,

994
01:06:41,959 --> 01:06:44,463
there's a possibility of
heart attack or stroke.

995
01:06:45,531 --> 01:06:48,966
Oh, that's not so good.

996
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,769
I gotta think about this.

997
01:06:50,803 --> 01:06:52,805
If your answer is yes,

998
01:06:52,837 --> 01:06:55,106
it would be better to
start the prep right away.

999
01:06:56,642 --> 01:07:01,012
Well, can I do the prep and
then cancel on the donation?

1000
01:07:02,113 --> 01:07:03,749
Yes, we're
running out of time.

1001
01:07:06,552 --> 01:07:08,853
Okay, okay, let's do it.

1002
01:07:08,886 --> 01:07:11,824
But I gotta warn you, doc,
I really hate needles,

1003
01:07:11,856 --> 01:07:15,026

get a bit clammy.

1004
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:15,860

I'm gonna sit down.

1008
01:07:37,248 --> 01:07:38,883
You'll be fine.

1009
01:07:40,084 --> 01:07:42,320
You want me to sit
with you for awhile?

1010
01:07:42,354 --> 01:07:43,988
I'll live, doc.

1011
01:07:44,021 --> 01:07:45,022

Charlie, are you okay?

1016
01:08:18,055 --> 01:08:19,924
Dr. Amira said you had
a reaction to the prep.

1017
01:08:19,957 --> 01:08:21,693
Yeah, yeah, I'm all right.

1018
01:08:21,727 --> 01:08:23,961
I'm gonna be fine, don't worry.

I'll live.

1020

It's kinda funny that
I'm your only match.

1021
01:08:31,336 --> 01:08:32,136
I know.

1022
01:08:33,405 --> 01:08:34,773

are you holding up?

Are you eating?

1026
01:08:40,178 --> 01:08:42,113
I could cook for you.

1027
01:08:42,146 --> 01:08:43,715
You can cook too.

Come, cook for me.

What's the surprise?

1036
01:09:53,785 --> 01:09:56,220
You know that restaurant
that was closed?

1037
01:09:56,254 --> 01:09:57,389
Well, I found the chef

1038
01:09:58,557 --> 01:10:00,626
and I had him make your
favorite crab cakes

1039

[phone ringing]

1080
01:14:07,572 --> 01:14:09,273
Yes, hello?

1081
01:14:09,306 --> 01:14:11,343
Yeah doc, I know I was
supposed to come in today

1082
01:14:11,376 --> 01:14:13,245
for another shot.

1083
01:14:13,277 --> 01:14:15,247
How late can I get there?

1084
01:14:15,279 --> 01:14:17,382
All right, I'll be
there, I promise.

1085
01:14:17,415 --> 01:14:18,617
Okay, bye-bye.

1086

[phone ringing]

1087
01:14:49,514 --> 01:14:50,482
Hey doc.

1088
01:14:50,515 --> 01:14:51,449
[Dr. Amira] Charlie?

1089
01:14:51,483 --> 01:14:52,984
America's in the
emergency room again.

1090
01:14:53,018 --> 01:14:54,386
So I just got here.

1091
01:14:54,419 --> 01:14:56,555
I need you to get here now.

1092
01:14:56,588 --> 01:14:59,291
[somber music]

1093
01:15:10,836 --> 01:15:11,636
Hey.

1094
01:15:13,071 --> 01:15:14,840
Horses eat that, you know.

1095
01:15:14,873 --> 01:15:17,509
You've been hanging
around me too much.

1096
01:15:17,542 --> 01:15:20,212
[America laughs]

1097
01:15:36,528 --> 01:15:37,829
Good, you're here.

1098
01:15:37,863 --> 01:15:39,364
We're gonna have to
move the procedure up

1099
01:15:39,397 --> 01:15:42,067
if we want the donation
to have any chance at all.

1100
01:15:43,134 --> 01:15:44,436
Are my numbers up?

1101
01:15:44,469 --> 01:15:46,938
Whatever they are, we
have to go with them.

1102
01:15:46,972 --> 01:15:48,173
[Charlie] Oh.

1103
01:15:48,206 --> 01:15:50,343
I'm trying to
book the procedure,

1104
01:15:50,375 --> 01:15:54,379
but the fucking insurance
company is not approving it.

1105
01:15:54,412 --> 01:15:56,481
America's life is at risk.

1106
01:15:56,514 --> 01:15:58,783
[Dr. Amira] Yeah,
I'm working on it.

1107
01:15:58,817 --> 01:16:00,185
Do they understand that?

1108
01:16:01,553 --> 01:16:04,022
I'm gonna have
to twist some arms.

1109
01:16:04,055 --> 01:16:05,490
Are you telling me
the insurance company

1110
01:16:05,523 --> 01:16:07,092
is gonna kill America?

1111
01:16:07,125 --> 01:16:09,194
I'll have to let you
know when I can book an OR.

1112
01:16:09,227 --> 01:16:12,197
Don't worry, we'll
get it sorted out.

1113
01:16:24,643 --> 01:16:25,443
Okay.

1114
01:16:32,450 --> 01:16:33,785
Visiting hours are over.

1115
01:16:34,986 --> 01:16:38,023
They're gonna kick
me out of here.

1116
01:16:38,056 --> 01:16:40,458
I'll be back in the morning.

1117
01:16:49,301 --> 01:16:51,870
[phone buzzing]

1118
01:17:02,447 --> 01:17:07,420
Google, what is
34.071 - 118.0451?

1119
01:17:19,731 --> 01:17:20,498
Oh.

1120
01:17:22,834 --> 01:17:27,406
Google, where is
35.071 - 118.064?

1121
01:17:35,814 --> 01:17:36,614
A-ha.

[intense music]

1123
01:18:22,827 --> 01:18:23,995
What's with all the spycraft?

1124
01:18:24,029 --> 01:18:24,829
Shh.

1125
01:18:26,231 --> 01:18:28,633
All right, the longitude
and latitude bit,

1126
01:18:28,666 --> 01:18:29,968
that was really clever.

1127
01:18:30,001 --> 01:18:31,903
It took me awhile
to figure it out.

1128
01:18:33,671 --> 01:18:36,074
[Natalie] Your second
installment for your services.

1129
01:18:37,642 --> 01:18:39,177
You could've mailed it to me.

1130
01:18:39,210 --> 01:18:41,347
There may not be
enough time for that.

1131
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:42,415
Conover's dead.

1132
01:18:43,715 --> 01:18:44,883
What the hell is going on?

1133
01:18:44,916 --> 01:18:46,017
[Natalie] Would you hush?

1134
01:18:46,051 --> 01:18:47,619
I know about Conover.

1135
01:18:47,652 --> 01:18:49,320
I mean, I've been
putting calls into Boris.

1136
01:18:49,355 --> 01:18:50,722
I thought he'd be furious.

1137
01:18:50,755 --> 01:18:52,757
So did I, but he's not.

1138
01:18:52,791 --> 01:18:55,528
He told me to give you
that and say thank you.

1139
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:56,961
I'm done?

1140
01:18:56,995 --> 01:18:59,297
The job is complete.

1141
01:18:59,331 --> 01:19:01,866
That doesn't make any sense.

1142
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:04,437
When the news broke,
Boris had a bunch of calls

1143
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:07,238
on an encrypted sat phone,

1144
01:19:07,272 --> 01:19:09,240
all speaking in Russian.

1145
01:19:11,576 --> 01:19:13,546
What's with the spycraft?

1146
01:19:13,578 --> 01:19:15,747
It's what Boris told me to do.

1147
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:16,614
Well, where the hell is he?

1148
01:19:16,648 --> 01:19:18,716
I need to speak to him.

1149
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:19,818
I don't know.

1150
01:19:19,851 --> 01:19:21,554
He's been partying
like an oligarch,

1151
01:19:21,586 --> 01:19:24,423
just drugs, girls, clubs.

1152
01:19:24,457 --> 01:19:27,560
Vegas, Cyprus, I don't
know where he is.

1153
01:19:27,592 --> 01:19:30,496
[glass shattering]

1154
01:19:36,335 --> 01:19:37,635
Son of a bitch.

1155
01:19:39,871 --> 01:19:43,241
He used me to get to Conover.

1156
01:19:43,274 --> 01:19:46,211
He also asked me
to give you this.

1157
01:19:48,713 --> 01:19:50,583
A photo of America's house.

1158
01:19:51,783 --> 01:19:53,017
That message is clear.

1159
01:19:56,054 --> 01:19:57,456
Fuck.

1160
01:19:57,490 --> 01:19:59,624
You should know,
he was very specific

1161
01:19:59,657 --> 01:20:02,727
about when and how I was
to give you that check

1162
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:05,063
and that envelope.

1163
01:20:05,096 --> 01:20:06,030
Be careful.

1164
01:20:07,999 --> 01:20:09,801
When you're driving
home tonight,

1165
01:20:10,835 --> 01:20:12,737
if you think you're
being followed,

1166
01:20:12,770 --> 01:20:15,240
you make three left
turns in a row.

1167
01:20:15,273 --> 01:20:19,310
If the car follows you, you go
right to the police station.

1168
01:20:19,345 --> 01:20:20,712
Understand?

1169
01:20:20,745 --> 01:20:21,779
Yeah.

1170
01:20:23,715 --> 01:20:24,816
I understand.

1171
01:21:05,723 --> 01:21:07,560
When I woke, you were gone.

1172
01:21:08,527 --> 01:21:09,761
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1173
01:21:09,794 --> 01:21:12,331
I had to meet someone
about our mutual friend.

1174
01:21:13,865 --> 01:21:14,866
How are you feeling?

1175
01:21:16,635 --> 01:21:17,403
Okay.

1176
01:21:18,571 --> 01:21:20,838
When you weren't
there I was worried.

1177
01:21:20,872 --> 01:21:22,707
I'm coming over
in a little bit.

1178
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:24,443
Do you want me to
bring you anything?

1179
01:21:25,877 --> 01:21:27,712
Just your sense of humor.

1180
01:21:29,415 --> 01:21:30,416
Roger that.

1181
01:21:31,483 --> 01:21:32,250
Ciao.

1182
01:21:43,795 --> 01:21:45,598
Well, they didn't waste
any time, did they?

1183
01:21:46,532 --> 01:21:48,800
Yeah, can I speak to Natalie?

1184
01:21:48,833 --> 01:21:50,735
[somber music]

1185
01:21:50,768 --> 01:21:52,371
Do you know when she'll be in?

1186
01:21:56,675 --> 01:21:58,743
What?

1187
01:21:58,776 --> 01:22:00,346
When did this happen?

1188
01:22:05,883 --> 01:22:08,253
I said it more than once.

1189
01:22:08,286 --> 01:22:09,921
There's only three
types of critters

1190
01:22:09,954 --> 01:22:13,958
in this world, sharks,
vampires, and victims.

1191
01:22:16,027 --> 01:22:19,732
You always try to be the
shark, just eat what you need,

1192
01:22:19,764 --> 01:22:24,902
but sometimes, sometimes
you end up being all three

1193
01:22:24,936 --> 01:22:26,405
at the same time.

1194
01:22:27,373 --> 01:22:30,342
Even still, there's karma.

1195
01:22:30,376 --> 01:22:32,076
In time the wheels will turn.

1196
01:22:33,612 --> 01:22:34,946
I wanted them to pay.

1197
01:22:36,715 --> 01:22:40,318
I wanted justice for
Conover and Natalie,

1198
01:22:42,554 --> 01:22:45,557
but there was a sword
over my head, America.

1199
01:22:48,326 --> 01:22:50,828
[phone buzzes]

1200
01:22:50,862 --> 01:22:52,797
Oh, thank God.

1201
01:22:52,830 --> 01:22:53,798
Hi, Charlie.

1202
01:22:53,831 --> 01:22:55,033
It's Dr. Amira.

1203
01:22:55,066 --> 01:22:56,801
The insurance approval
finally came in.

1204
01:22:56,834 --> 01:22:59,103
I booked an OR for
tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.

1205
01:22:59,137 --> 01:23:01,973
I need you to call
and confirm asap.

1206
01:23:02,006 --> 01:23:04,809
No food or drink for
the next 12 hours.

1207

That's very important.

1208
01:23:06,311 --> 01:23:07,912
Okay, let me know
that you got this.

1209
01:23:07,945 --> 01:23:11,617
And it's okay to take your
BP meds with a sip of water.

1210

1211
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:22,960
Yep.

1212
01:23:24,797 --> 01:23:25,930
You okay?

1213
01:23:25,963 --> 01:23:28,066
Yeah, I just don't like needles.

1214
01:23:28,099 --> 01:23:28,866
That's all.

1215
01:23:30,336 --> 01:23:31,102

Where the hell are you?

1227
01:26:00,084 --> 01:26:01,954
Listen to me, I have a
narrow window of time here.

1228
01:26:02,019 --> 01:26:04,055
You get your ass here now!

1229
01:26:04,088 --> 01:26:06,157

chasing Russians in the
middle of Los Angeles

1233

when my love was
waiting for my aid?

1234
01:27:19,431 --> 01:27:20,933
I know what you're thinking.

1235
01:27:22,199 --> 01:27:25,102
You need to hear some kind
of plea for absolution

1236
01:27:26,103 --> 01:27:28,740
or an explanation
for my complicity.

that I'm scared.

I'm gonna wake up.

I did what I could
is what I would say.

1245
01:27:54,265 --> 01:27:56,068
Maybe I made a difference.

I can save you.
