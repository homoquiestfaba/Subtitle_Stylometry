Why couldn't they
just leave her alone?

Because she robbed
a bank, dummy?

00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:36,180
[Maggie] Something bold...

188
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:38,316
I know...

189
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:40,218
Something brilliant.

190
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,019
I know!

191
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:43,421
[Maggie and Janie] What?

192
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:46,290
"Possum."

193
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,926
[Maggie] Play dead?

194
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,231
[Janie] It's perfect.

195
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:08,246
[car door slams]

196
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,218
Daddy.

197
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,787
Hello, sweetheart.

198
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,658
[Martin] How was your day?

199
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,526
[Janie] Fine, how was
yours?

200
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,629
[Martin] Well, well not bad.

201
00:19:58,631 --> 00:19:59,830
Hello, Donna.

202
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:02,300
Hello, Martin. How are you?

203
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:03,834
How are you?

204
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,703
Fine.

205
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,605
Mommy went to the doctor.

206
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:09,674
[Donna] Well,
I wasn't feeling well.

207
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,509
[Martin] Oh, I'm sorry.

208
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:17,982
[Donna] It's not your fault.

209
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:19,817
Can I fix you another drink?

210
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,419
That'd be nice.

211
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,487
Janie, would you
like a drink?

212
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:24,889
That would be nice.

213
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,073
[Janie] I lost my joke book.

214
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,108
[Martin] Well, try to
remember where you were

215
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,810
the last time you had it.

216
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:48,179
But, I can't remember.

217
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,415
That's how you find it.

218
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,655
[Martin] There
you go, Princess.

219
00:20:57,657 --> 00:20:59,590
One soda pop on the rocks.

220
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,392
[Janie] Thanks, Daddy.

221
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:20,411
There's a dent in your car.

222
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:25,583
Did you hit something,
or did something hit you?

223
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,187
Will the insurance pay for it?

224
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:34,392
Well it helps if you tell them
what happened.

225
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,929
Maybe someone hit the car
while it was parked.

226
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:41,265
That sounds right.

227
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:52,677
Hi, son.

228
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,045
Hey, Dad.

229
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:56,681
It's time to wash
your hands for dinner.

230
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:57,948
They're not dirty.

231
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:01,085
Ah. It's a good policy to
wash them anyway.

232
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:03,154
OK.

233
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:20,504
[Martin] Dinner is ready.

234
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:21,806
Hello, Christian.

235
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:23,774
[Christian] Hi, Dad.

236
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:24,975
You been reading?

237
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:26,577
Uh huh.

238
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:31,449
Sam go tell your sister
to come to supper.

239
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:33,818
[Sam shouting]
Maggie, dinner.

240
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,087
Bacon and eggs.

241
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:39,323
I always liked having bacon
and eggs for dinner.

242
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:41,192
Feels kind of special.

243
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:43,794
Like we're getting up early
and going somewhere.

244
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:45,396
Yes, we could be
eating breakfast

245
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:47,998
in the middle of the night
before starting out on a trip.

246
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,233
To Tahiti.

247
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:51,135
No, the South Pole.

248
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:53,637
Outerspace.

249
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:00,277
Maggie, where would
you choose to go?

250
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:03,914
Anywhere.

251
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:09,720
Well, I saw they
caught Patty Hearst.

252
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,823
She said she wouldn't let
herself be taken alive.

253
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,792
She knew if she was dead,
everyone would just say

254
00:23:14,794 --> 00:23:17,495
she was crazy instead of
having to face the truth.

255
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:19,663
The truth is, she's a terrorist.

256
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,599
She's a resistance fighter.

257
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:23,901
You have to be occupied
to put up a resistance.

258
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:27,138
She is occupied...
by the system.

259
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,506
The system.

260
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:30,775
Well, there is a
system of sorts.

261
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:32,910
A social and political system

262
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,612
that exerts a
measure of control...

263
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:37,615
You're brainwashed, Dad.

264
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:41,986
- over our our actions...
- Dad, you're brainwashed.

265
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:43,888
... and our thoughts.

266
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,624
Sam, you shouldn't say
that to someone's face.

267
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:49,026
You say it behind
their backs.

268
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:54,365
I need another drink.

269
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:55,433
Let's have a spelling bee.

270
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:57,635
Spelling bee?

271
00:23:57,637 --> 00:23:58,969
With all my good spellers?

272
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:00,738
[Sam and Janie] Yeah.

273
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:05,476
Well, OK. Let's see.

274
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:13,083
Janie, can you spell familiar?

275
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:15,286
Familiar.

276
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:18,522
F-A-M-I...

277
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:21,058
- L-I-A-R
- Good.

278
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:26,630
Now, Christian. Can you
spell sanctuary?

279
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,032
What's a sanctuary?

280
00:24:28,034 --> 00:24:30,968
It's a special place,
a protected place.

281
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:36,941
Like a hiding place...

282
00:24:36,943 --> 00:24:39,610
Sanctuary.

283
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:42,780
S-A-N-C-T-U-A-R-Y

284
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:44,482
Right.

285
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,717
You see, spelling is a skill.

286
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:48,452
You don't have to know
what a word means

287
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:50,921
to be able to spell it.

288
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:54,692
OK, Maggie. How about ...

289
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:56,961
... Habeas Corpus.

290
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:58,462
That's Latin.

291
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:01,966
Well, it's a legal term.

292
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:07,371
H-A-B-E-U-S

293
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:11,509
C-O-R-P-U-S.

294
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:16,347
Not quite. It's H-A-B-E-A-S.

295
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:17,781
I said it was Latin.

296
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,886
It's fair. It's in the
English language.

297
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:23,821
Sam, it's your turn.

298
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,826
Can you spell soap?

299
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:30,628
Why don't you give
Mom a word?

300
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,197
[Sam] Soap. S-O-A-P.

301
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,798
[Martin] Good, Son.

302
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,367
[Sam] I got an A in spelling.

303
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:40,137
Why don't you give
Mom a word to spell?

304
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:45,743
Did you get a report
card today, Sam?

305
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,513
Sam.

306
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:50,848
[Sam] Yeah.

307
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:51,882
Where is it.

308
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,284
[Maggie] Let's see
if she can spell.

309
00:25:53,286 --> 00:25:55,452
Your mother isn't in
the spelling bee.

310
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:56,854
- [Maggie] Why not?
- For God's sake, Martin.

311
00:25:56,856 --> 00:25:59,023
Do something.

312
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:02,259
[clears throat]

313
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:11,201
Donna, can you spell...

314
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:15,606
Matrimonial?

315
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:24,348
As in "matrimonial law?"
I did marry a lawyer, didn't I?

316
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,050
[Martin] Yes.

317
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:33,023
M-A-T-R-I-M-O-N-I-A-L

318
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:42,533
Good.

319
00:26:42,535 --> 00:26:45,436
Sammie, give me
your report card.

320
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:50,074
He made all A's

321
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:53,611
[Sam] And one C.

322
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,215
I want to see it.

323
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,705
All A's.

324
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:22,506
And one C.

325
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:24,241
That's excellent, Sam.

326
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,012
It is. Don't you
worry about the C.

327
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:31,148
You can probably still
get into college.

328
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:40,357
[doorbell rings]

329
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:50,300
That must be the Knotts.

330
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:54,405
I'll get it.

331
00:27:54,407 --> 00:27:57,508
Janie, can you
spell damnation?

332
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,842
Is that two words?

333
00:27:58,844 --> 00:27:59,777
[Donna] Maggie.

334
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:00,878
[Clark] Hello.

335
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,280
[Martin] Hey. Come on in.

336
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:05,082
Can I fix you a drink, Clark?

337
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:07,418
[Clark] Yes, please. I'll have
what you're having.

338
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,520
[Martin] Scotch.

339
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:10,821
Nadia, the usual?

340
00:28:10,823 --> 00:28:13,057
What else?

341
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:15,159
We were just having a
spelling bee.

342
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:17,628
Hello, Cantwell children.

343
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,863
[Janie] Hello, Mrs. Knotts.

344
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:26,103
- A report card?
- That's Sam's.

345
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:27,905
Can I look?

346
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,841
- [Sam barks like a dog]
- Don't.

347
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,146
He made all A's.

348
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:38,382
Well, you are smart children.
I know that.

349
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:39,917
[Maggie] Go upstairs.

350
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,251
And don't forget
your report card.

351
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:42,186
[Sam barks]

352
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:47,591
Sam, stand up.

353
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:48,592
No, act right.

354
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:51,395
Come on. I want
you to take these.

355
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:56,767
Go on. Be a good boy.

356
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:58,836
- Well it's nice...
- What are we waiting for?

357
00:28:58,838 --> 00:29:01,238
... to be here.
I don't know.

358
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,303
[dog barks outside]

359
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:43,080
[Maggie] OK. They
all played "possum."

360
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:45,349
[bells ring]

361
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,521
[Maggie] The cop
walked around,

362
00:29:50,523 --> 00:29:57,060
and looked at each one of
them very, very closely.

363
00:29:57,062 --> 00:30:01,832
[Sam] But they didn't move,
and didn't make a sound.

364
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,939
They didn't even breathe.

365
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:13,944
[Maggie] They all laid so
quiet and still,

366
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:18,982
that he couldn't detect

there's cheerleading

- But I wish there was...

370
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:55,719
[Clark] I wish there was...
I would watch the Olympics.

[Nadia] Fantastic.

372

[Martin] Not too strong?
[Nadia] Not too strong.

373
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:00,290
[Nadia] Last night was a little
strong.

374

[Sam] Playing
"possum" worked?

375

[Maggie] Yeah.

376

When the cop finally
believed they were dead,

377
00:31:12,238 --> 00:31:14,137
he went off to get help.

378
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:15,672
So, they went to the beach.

379
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:17,374
And jumped in a boat.

A sailboat...

381
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:26,383
[Maggie] ... and sailed away.

Janie, you're just
making more work for me

383
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:31,188

How am I making more work
for you?

385
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:35,959

have to take care of you.

386

You're not taking care
of me right now.

387
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:39,463
Yes, I am.

388
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:40,564
[Nadia] So, how are
the children?

389
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:44,501
[Martin] Oh,
the children are fine.

390
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,536

[Martin] Hey have got
a joke for us, Janie?

392

[Janie] I can't remember any.

393
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:51,074
Oh, come on.

394
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:54,711
You can remember
at least one, can't you?

395
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:57,180
I need the book. I can
only remember a little bit.

396

Oh, just tell us the part
you remember.

- I bet it will still be funny.
- Yeah.

398
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:07,257
OK. So, a man said...

399
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,259
No wait. He liked two girls.

400
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:12,162
One named Kate and the
other named Edith.

401
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:14,331
One Spade.

402
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:16,099
I can't remember the rest.

403
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:19,002
But at the end, he said, "I
want to have my Kate

404
00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:20,437

[Nadia] They're so easy to
love.

414

They don't ask for anything

415

They just accept what you
give them.

416
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:41,925
Why do we we ever grow
up?

417
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:43,293
Why can't we stay
children forever?

418
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:46,363
Janie, you have
homework to do.

419
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:50,167
Children can be selfish,
demanding, and cruel.

How would you know?

421
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,274
I was a child.

me the dummy.

corpus mean?

Ah. Produce the body.

447
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,805
A writ of habeas corpus

brought before the court

449

Shut up. I can't concentrate
while you're talking.

544
00:43:19,731 --> 00:43:20,697
Dad could beat Mr. Knotts

545
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:22,865
in an arm wrestling
match any day.

546
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,168
Mom could beat
Mrs. Knotts, too.

547
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:26,669
Shut up.

548
00:43:26,671 --> 00:43:29,272
Grown ups don't
arm wrestle.

549
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:41,117
You win.

550
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,285
[door closes]

551
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:46,222
[bell rings]

552
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:55,231
They sailed far away from
land. Far fro everything.

553
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:59,068
And then, one day when the
younger girl was fishing...

554
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:01,371
something jerked the line.

555
00:44:01,373 --> 00:44:04,674
So hard it pulled her
overboard.

556
00:44:04,676 --> 00:44:08,077
She held onto the line as the
fish dragged her away.

557
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:12,482
And then, the line broke.

558
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:14,851
And the fish swam away.

559
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:20,857
She floated, waiting for the
boat to find her.

560
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:23,326
But it didn't come.

561
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:29,465
At night, God pulls the
covers up over the earth,

562
00:44:29,467 --> 00:44:31,267
and puts it to bed.

563
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:33,036
The world never
goes to bed.

564
00:44:33,038 --> 00:44:35,738
While one half is asleep, the
other half is always awake.

565
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:39,642
But it keeps the light on.
That's why you see stars.

566
00:44:39,644 --> 00:44:42,378
They're little tiny
holes in the blanket...

567
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,312
for the light to come through.

568
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:45,848
That's not what
the stars are.

569
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,384
Space is empty,
and the stars are on fire.

570
00:44:48,386 --> 00:44:51,921
Nuh uh. Mommy told me
when I was a little girl.

571
00:44:51,923 --> 00:44:53,423
Mom is a well known liar.

572
00:44:53,425 --> 00:44:55,525
She was just telling you a
story.

573
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:56,826
No.

574
00:44:56,828 --> 00:44:59,562
Another stupid, drunk story.

575
00:44:59,564 --> 00:45:00,863
Don't say that.

576
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,202
Take it back.

577
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:15,645
You have to take it back.

578
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:22,552
OK. OK.

579
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:27,957
I take it back.

580
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:34,163
I want my Mommy.

581
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:46,175
And just as she was about to
drown...

582
00:45:46,177 --> 00:45:49,278
she turned around, and
there was an island.

583
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,915
She lay down on
the sand half dead.

584
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:55,418
The next day, she heard
voices and saw some

585
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:58,321
natives making a fire on the
beach.

586
00:45:58,323 --> 00:46:00,289
"She's already half
cooked by the sun,

587
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:03,392
so it won't take long,"
one of them said.

588
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:06,462
And then the Chief's son,
who was handsome,

589
00:46:06,464 --> 00:46:11,868
said, "She is beautiful.
I'd rather not eat her."

590
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:15,371
And then another said, "We
have to kill her.

591
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:19,342
She will feed us for a week."

592
00:46:19,344 --> 00:46:23,146
Then Takuna said to her,
"My tribe is hungry.

593
00:46:23,148 --> 00:46:25,548
Help us and I
will spare you."

594
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,584
Then she reached
into her pocket,

595
00:46:28,586 --> 00:46:31,053
and pulled out
some seeds and said,

596
00:46:31,055 --> 00:46:34,223
"I have beans and corn,

597
00:46:34,225 --> 00:46:36,826
and tomatoes and apples.

598
00:46:36,828 --> 00:46:39,629
We will plant them,
and you'll have a garden.

599
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:42,698
and never be hungry again."

600
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,835
[party chatter]

601
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:53,342
[Donna shouts]

602
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:10,226
Hello sweetheart, what are
you doing down here?

603
00:47:10,228 --> 00:47:12,228
Maggie said I was stupid.

604
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:15,498
Oh. You are not stupid
sweetheart.

605
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,933
And you can tell Maggie

606
00:47:16,935 --> 00:47:20,102
that I said you are
smarter than she is.

607
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,041
Can I stay here
with you, Mommy?

608
00:47:25,043 --> 00:47:29,278
Aw, now the little
con artist comes out.

609
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,280
For five minutes.
I won't say anything.

610
00:47:31,282 --> 00:47:33,950
No. You have to
go back upstairs.

611
00:47:33,952 --> 00:47:37,386
We're having a
grown up evening.

612
00:47:37,388 --> 00:47:38,955
Oh.

613
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:44,427
I found my joke book.
I'll tell you a joke.

614
00:47:44,429 --> 00:47:47,230
Janie.

615
00:47:47,232 --> 00:47:49,031
- There was once a little ...
- Janie.

616
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:52,702
... who was very, very poor.

617
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:55,004
I think you'd better go
upstairs now, Janie,

618
00:47:55,006 --> 00:47:57,306
like your mother says.

619
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:00,743
Maggie said the stars
are on fire.

620
00:48:00,745 --> 00:48:03,980
She said God doesn't pull
the covers over us at night.

621
00:48:03,982 --> 00:48:07,016
The stars are on fire.
And God is very busy.

622
00:48:07,018 --> 00:48:09,385
She's just very tired.

623
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:14,156
Hey, you tell Maggie that
I said to put you to bed.

624
00:48:14,158 --> 00:48:16,726
- Now?
- Now.

625
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:21,264
- Goodnight, Janie.
- [Nadia] Goodnight, Janie.

626
00:48:21,266 --> 00:48:25,635
- Goodnight, Janie.
- Goodnight, Janie.

627
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:34,610
She's exhausted.

628
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:44,020
[Christian and Sam play]

629
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:49,358
[Maggie] Janie.

630
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:54,964
[Janie] And then,
Takuna, kissed her,

631
00:48:54,966 --> 00:48:57,466
and the natives
danced around her.

632
00:48:57,468 --> 00:48:59,969
<i>And Takuna asked her to</i>
<i>marry him.</i>

633
00:48:59,971 --> 00:49:01,971
<i>And she said, yes.</i>

634
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:08,244
And they went to go
live in his tree house.

635
00:49:08,246 --> 00:49:10,212
[Sam] What about the boat?

636
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:14,517
Well, one day a year later,
the boat came to the island.

637
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:16,152
A year?

638
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:20,189
What could they be
doing for a year?

639
00:49:20,191 --> 00:49:22,391
Never mind.

640
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:24,860
[music starts]

641
00:49:24,862 --> 00:49:26,963
[Martin] There you go.
Dance it up.

642
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:28,064
I'm gonna dance
with your wife.

643
00:49:28,066 --> 00:49:29,999
[Martin]
Don't step on her toes.

644
00:49:30,001 --> 00:49:34,971
- [Clark] I'm not. - [Martin]
She doesn't like that.

645
00:49:34,973 --> 00:49:38,040
[Clark] You guys have
whipped cream?

646
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:39,208
[Martin] Oh gosh,
we could whip some up.

647
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:45,548
[Maggie] Janie.

648
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:47,316
Come back inside, Janie.

649
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:04,734
[Maggie] Oh, Sam.
No you can't come out here.

650
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:06,969
[Christian] Wow.

651
00:50:06,971 --> 00:50:09,338
Oh, great.

652
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,507
Wow.

653
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:13,376
It looks different
from up here.

654
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:17,680
We're on a spaceship.

655
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:20,383
We've been traveling
the universe.

656
00:50:20,385 --> 00:50:24,420
But now, we're going home
to our own planet, Megatron.

657
00:50:24,422 --> 00:50:26,022
Navigator, where are we?

658
00:50:26,024 --> 00:50:27,590
Lost in space, Captain.

659
00:50:27,592 --> 00:50:29,125
But I can find our
way out of here.

660
00:50:29,127 --> 00:50:31,894
We must be tangled
up in the blanket.

661
00:50:31,896 --> 00:50:33,462
Tie up the prisoner.

662
00:50:33,464 --> 00:50:35,431
[Sam] Don't try to escape.

663
00:50:35,433 --> 00:50:38,267
I'll set a course
for Megatron.

664
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:41,837
[Christian] They sailed
South by Southeast.

665
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,773
Navigating by the stars.

666
00:50:43,775 --> 00:50:47,009
Warp factor five. Full speed.

667
00:50:47,011 --> 00:50:48,911
[Christian] Past the
Bermuda Triangle.

668
00:50:48,913 --> 00:50:51,113
between Africa and South
America.

669
00:50:51,115 --> 00:50:53,115
It's gonna get rough.

670
00:50:53,117 --> 00:50:55,951
[Christian] One day the sky
went dark,

671
00:50:55,953 --> 00:50:57,853
and the wind started to blow

672
00:50:57,855 --> 00:50:59,822
and the ocean threw the
boat around like a ball.

673
00:50:59,824 --> 00:51:02,992
- God help us.
- Christian, be careful.

674
00:51:02,994 --> 00:51:04,226
[Christian] And right in front
of them was a ship,

675
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:06,962
with a hundred sails on it.

676
00:51:06,964 --> 00:51:08,330
As the boat drifted closer,

677
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:10,866
they saw pirates,
smelly pirates

678
00:51:10,868 --> 00:51:12,668
with tattoos and
missing teeth.

679
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:14,270
Aliens, aliens. Take 'em
out. Take 'em out.

680
00:51:14,272 --> 00:51:15,871
[Christian] The pirates threw
a big net down on them

681
00:51:15,873 --> 00:51:18,240
and hoisted them
up over the deck.

682
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,976
Then Red Beard, the
captain, said,

683
00:51:20,978 --> 00:51:23,412
"Ah. I spy a young man.

684
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,181
A fancy pants.

685
00:51:25,183 --> 00:51:27,483
We'll have to get rid of him."

686
00:51:27,485 --> 00:51:28,951
So they put him
on the plank,

687
00:51:28,953 --> 00:51:30,719
and all the pirates
were yelling,

688
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:33,889
"Walk the plank,
walk the plank."

689
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:36,592
[Christian] So he
walks out onto the edge,

690
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:38,561
and looks down
onto the ocean.

691
00:51:38,563 --> 00:51:39,962
Captain, it's a meteor.

692
00:51:39,964 --> 00:51:43,232
The steering mechanism...
It's jammed.

693
00:51:43,234 --> 00:51:45,201
And does a triple back flip
with a half twist.

694
00:51:45,203 --> 00:51:46,235
- Christian
- ...into the ocean.

695
00:51:46,237 --> 00:51:47,336
- Ah.
- Christian.

696
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:49,672
- [Janie screams]
- [Maggie] Christian.

697
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:54,810
[Christian]
Not even a splash.

698
00:51:54,812 --> 00:51:57,746
[Maggie] Hold on
Christian, I'm coming.

699
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:07,323
Is someone hurt?

700
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:13,596
Oh, the kids just wanted to
play , um emergency room,

701
00:52:13,598 --> 00:52:15,998
so I was just
getting some stuff.

702
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,200
Well, don't let
anyone get hurt.

703
00:52:18,202 --> 00:52:20,069
I won't.

704
00:52:20,071 --> 00:52:23,639
Maggie, remember
when you

705
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:27,610
won the sixth grade
spelling bee?

706
00:52:27,612 --> 00:52:31,113
We worked on it every night,
learning all those words.

707
00:52:31,115 --> 00:52:35,518
What was that word?
The winning word.

708
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,752
[Maggie] I don't remember.

709
00:52:36,754 --> 00:52:39,355
Uh, it's... uh...

710
00:52:39,357 --> 00:52:40,789
"Icthyophagous"

711
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:47,196
I-C-H-T-H-Y-O

712
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:51,066
P-H-A-G-O-U-S

713
00:52:51,068 --> 00:52:53,269
Fish-eating.

714
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:58,340
Goodnight, Dad.

715
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:00,709
Maggie.

716
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:05,147
Is there...

717
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:08,050
Do you need
help with anything?

718
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:12,888
Any problems...
I could help you with?

719
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:19,895
I can handle it.

720
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,516
I was just trying
to scare you.

721
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:44,153
You scared me.

722
00:53:44,155 --> 00:53:48,657
Me too. I thought
I was falling off, too.

723
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:51,794
It's OK Sammie. Don't cry.

724
00:53:51,796 --> 00:53:55,731
Yeah, I'm fine, see.

725
00:53:55,733 --> 00:54:00,269
I thought I was falling
off the roof with you.

726
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:08,811
[sobbing]

727
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,151
[Maggie]
Who wants ice cream?

728
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:23,192
[Clark] OK. I got a joke.
So this guy, this oil tycoon,

729
00:54:23,194 --> 00:54:26,028
California on a big
old plane, and he

730
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:28,664
gets there and he checks
into this big old hotel.

731
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:30,666
He wants a drink, so he
goes to the bar

732
00:54:30,668 --> 00:54:33,769
and there's this pretty little
lady at the other end.

733
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:38,307
So, he goes and chats

734
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:39,341
with her and they
start putting down

735
00:54:39,343 --> 00:54:40,509
double drinks,
rounds and rounds.

736
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:42,311
- And they get hungry, right?
- Yeah

737
00:54:42,313 --> 00:54:46,081
So, they go to the
restaurant of the hotel,

738
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:48,450
and they order the
biggest steaks on the menu

739
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:51,887
and this big huge flaming
fancy French dessert.

740
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:54,456
"Ma'am would you like
to go up to my room?

741
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:57,426
It is the biggest suite
in the whole hotel.

742
00:54:57,428 --> 00:55:00,095
She says, "Yeah."
And so they go up there,

743
00:55:00,097 --> 00:55:02,598
and start fooling around.

744
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,200
And he takes off this
big old cowboy hat.

745
00:55:05,202 --> 00:55:07,536
He takes off his big old
cowboy boots.

746
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:11,240
And he unbuckles his
big old cowboy belt buckle.

747
00:55:11,242 --> 00:55:13,108
And he drops his pants.

748
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:16,345
And he says, "Ma'am, I'm
just gonna have to warn you,

749
00:55:16,347 --> 00:55:19,848
I'm from Fort Worth Texas
and I am big.

750
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,116
And he takes off his
underwear

751
00:55:21,118 --> 00:55:22,918
and he shows her what he's
talking about.

752
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,220
[Donna laughs]

753
00:55:25,222 --> 00:55:27,222
Then he spreads
her legs open,

754
00:55:27,224 --> 00:55:29,825
and he thrusts
himself inside her.

755
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:31,927
And he stops.

756
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:34,163
And he looks down.

757
00:55:34,165 --> 00:55:37,566
He looks back up
at her in amazement.

758
00:55:37,568 --> 00:55:40,436
He says, "Golly ma'am.

759
00:55:40,438 --> 00:55:42,471
What part of Texas
are you from?"

760
00:55:42,473 --> 00:55:44,540
[Donna and Clark laugh]

761
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,781
[Donna] That is so funny.

762
00:55:52,783 --> 00:55:58,354
[Clark] Get it? What part of
Texas are you from?

763
00:55:58,356 --> 00:56:01,490
What part of Texas are you
from, ma'am?

764
00:56:01,492 --> 00:56:03,459
[Donna shouting] Big man.

765
00:56:03,461 --> 00:56:05,294
[Martin] Jesus, Donna.

766
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:09,031
[Clark] Come on,
it's not that big.

767
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:11,567
It's more like the
Rio Grande.

768
00:56:11,569 --> 00:56:17,072
- [Donna] Stop. Stop.

769
00:56:17,074 --> 00:56:19,742
- You know what I'm
saying...

770
00:56:19,744 --> 00:56:22,411
[Clark laughs]

771
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:27,616
[Donna] Oh, Martin.
Don't look at me like that.

772
00:56:27,618 --> 00:56:29,084
God.

773
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:34,156
[Donna] We're all
grown ups here, right?

774
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:40,996
Oh, Nadia, what?
You didn't know?

775
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,635
Did you know?

776
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:55,177
You didn't bother
to hide it. Did you?

777
00:56:57,881 --> 00:57:00,249
Now we all know.

778
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:01,350
You could have
had the decency...

779
00:57:01,352 --> 00:57:03,252
- [Donna] The decency to
lie? - The decency...

780
00:57:03,254 --> 00:57:04,486
[Donna] The decency
to pretend

781
00:57:04,488 --> 00:57:06,121
[Martin] The decency not to
bring it into this house.

782
00:57:06,123 --> 00:57:08,690
[Donna] This is my home.

783
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,362
I will bring my life,
all of it, into my home.

784
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:20,869
[Donna] I am going
to get another drink.

785
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:04,112
[Donna] Maggie?

786
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:30,405
[Sam] They sailed to the
bottom of the world.

787
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:37,946
It was cold. It was freezing.

788
00:58:37,948 --> 00:58:43,619
And the boat ran into an
iceberg and got stuck.

789
00:58:43,621 --> 00:58:47,589
So, they got out to push it.

790
00:58:47,591 --> 00:58:51,593
And all the other kids
jumped back on the boat.

791
00:58:51,595 --> 00:58:54,830
But a little boy was
standing on the iceberg,

792
00:58:54,832 --> 00:58:58,233
and it was floating away
from the boat.

793
00:58:58,235 --> 00:59:00,569
And then he couldn't even
see the boat anymore,

794
00:59:00,571 --> 00:59:02,271
because there was
a blizzard

795
00:59:02,273 --> 00:59:04,773
and giant snowmen all
around him.

796
00:59:04,775 --> 00:59:10,779
20 feet tall, staring
at him with white eyes.

797
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:24,526
[vomiting]

798
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:31,433
Shit.

799
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:57,993
- [Donna sobs] Goddamn it.
- Mom.

800
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:03,165
[Maggie] What's wrong?

801
01:00:06,636 --> 01:00:08,303
[toilet flushes]

802
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:10,505
I'm sick.

803
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:17,212
You're sick to your stomach?

804
01:00:17,214 --> 01:00:23,819
I'm just sick.
Sick of everything.

805
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,729
Hand me my drink.

806
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:39,801
You should take it
easy on that stuff.

807
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:43,171
I'll take that under
advisement.

808
01:00:43,173 --> 01:00:44,740
I just. I think...

809
01:00:44,742 --> 01:00:49,878
I don't care what
you think about it.

810
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:54,916
You don't care what
I think about anything.

811
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:00,789
You hate me.

812
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,926
I don't hate you, Maggie.

813
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:11,600
You can't hate
your own child.

814
01:01:11,602 --> 01:01:14,503
It's too much a part of you.

815
01:01:14,505 --> 01:01:17,305
It's too much like you.

816
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:21,376
I don't want to be like you.

817
01:01:23,546 --> 01:01:26,014
Am I really that bad?

818
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:29,518
No, I just want to be
different.

819
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,487
Who I want to be.

820
01:01:35,658 --> 01:01:38,460
Don't get your hopes up.

821
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:48,103
Is that why you're fooling
around with Mr. Knotts?

822
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:54,242
I saw you.

823
01:01:55,978 --> 01:01:57,512
Whatever you
think you saw...

824
01:01:57,514 --> 01:01:59,448
Are you fucking him, too?

825
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:07,389
Feel better now?

826
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:11,526
No, now I need
another drink.

827
01:02:13,629 --> 01:02:14,996
Sorry, that's not funny.

828
01:02:14,998 --> 01:02:19,367
No, you're a riot, Mom.

829
01:02:19,369 --> 01:02:21,870
We all think so.

830
01:02:21,872 --> 01:02:25,273
Me and Christian,
and Janie, and Sam.

831
01:02:25,275 --> 01:02:26,641
This isn't about you.

832
01:02:26,643 --> 01:02:30,011
You try to make
everything about you.

833
01:02:30,013 --> 01:02:33,648
But, this is my life.
This is about me.

834
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:46,428
[Janie] Truth or
consequences?

835
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:49,030
[Sam] What's
consequences?

836
01:02:49,032 --> 01:02:51,133
[Christian] Just say truth.

837
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:53,735
No one wants
consequences.

838
01:02:53,737 --> 01:02:55,504
[Sam] Truth.

839
01:02:55,506 --> 01:03:00,675
[Janie] OK. What's the worst
thing you've ever done?

840
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:06,481
[Sam] I wet the bed when I
stayed at Aunt Jean's house.

841
01:03:06,483 --> 01:03:09,951
[Maggie] That's not a bad
thing, that's an accident.

842
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:11,553
[Janie] Maggie.

843
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:14,556
We're sleeping
up here tonight.

844
01:03:14,558 --> 01:03:15,757
Why?

845
01:03:15,759 --> 01:03:18,660
Because I said so.

846
01:03:18,662 --> 01:03:20,128
OK, Bossy.

847
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:21,797
I brought Ted.

848
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:07,442
[dogs barking]

849
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:40,976
[Christian] I can't sleep.

850
01:04:40,978 --> 01:04:43,278
Me neither.

851
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:47,515
[Sam] Me neither.

852
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:52,187
[Maggie] I guess no
one can sleep tonight.

853
01:04:52,189 --> 01:04:54,356
[Sam] Tell us a story.

854
01:04:54,358 --> 01:04:57,058
[Maggie] You tell me a story.

855
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,895
[Janie] You start.

856
01:05:07,703 --> 01:05:10,005
[bell rings]

857
01:05:15,044 --> 01:05:22,117
[Maggie] Once upon
a time in a country far away,

858
01:05:23,286 --> 01:05:28,890
there were four children
who ran away from home.

859
01:05:28,892 --> 01:05:30,926
Without their parents?

860
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:34,996
They didn't have
any parents.

861
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:44,339
[Maggie] They
sailed far out to sea,

862
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:48,009
past the last known country,

863
01:05:48,011 --> 01:05:52,681
into uncharted waters, where
no adult had ever been.

864
01:05:53,683 --> 01:05:58,887
Until they reached their
destination: Child Land

865
01:05:58,889 --> 01:06:01,456
This would make
a good novel.

866
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:07,996
One I'd like to read.

867
01:06:07,998 --> 01:06:12,233
Everywhere there were
pizza shops, and bakeries,

868
01:06:12,235 --> 01:06:15,737
and bowling alleys, and
swimming pools.

869
01:06:15,739 --> 01:06:17,372
You seem to be enjoying
yourself.

870
01:06:17,374 --> 01:06:18,873
What's wrong with that?

871
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:20,041
Then she started noticing

872
01:06:20,043 --> 01:06:23,745
there were lots of 16 year
olds, but no 17 year olds.

873
01:06:23,747 --> 01:06:26,314
Finally, a kid told her, "They
get too old for Child Land,

874
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:28,116
so we put them to sleep."

875
01:06:28,118 --> 01:06:30,352
Otherwise they would
become grown ups

876
01:06:30,354 --> 01:06:31,653
and take over the country.

877
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:34,589
You cannot just do
whatever you please.

878
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:37,993
Watch me.

879
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:57,078
Well, I guess we're in
this together, aren't we?

880
01:07:13,095 --> 01:07:14,596
So she went underground,

881
01:07:14,598 --> 01:07:16,131
and joined the
resistance movement

882
01:07:16,133 --> 01:07:17,098
that was trying to save

883
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:19,968
the lives of teenagers
in captivity.

884
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:22,837
But the other kids
wanted to find her

885
01:07:22,839 --> 01:07:25,173
She sent them a message...

886
01:07:25,175 --> 01:07:26,908
...in code.

887
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:30,178
Every number stood
for a different letter.

888
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:31,546
The message said...

889
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:33,148
[loud knocking]

890
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:47,796
[Martin] Maggie. I want
you to come downstairs.

891
01:07:47,798 --> 01:07:50,532
I'll be back soon.

892
01:07:52,368 --> 01:07:54,402
- Go to sleep.
- [knocking]

893
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:56,471
[Martin] Maggie.

894
01:08:19,628 --> 01:08:21,062
Don't do this.

895
01:08:21,064 --> 01:08:24,732
Maggie, your mother is
trying to destroy this family.

896
01:08:24,734 --> 01:08:27,202
Please, Martin.
Leave her out of it.

897
01:08:27,204 --> 01:08:30,605
[Martin] I want her to see
how much she's hurting you.

898
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:33,508
You want to be
a family, don't you?

899
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:35,076
You want a mother?

900
01:08:35,078 --> 01:08:37,045
Martin, it's too late
for all of this.

901
01:08:37,047 --> 01:08:41,516
It's not too late.
We are still a family.

902
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:45,086
Tell her, Maggie.

903
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:52,460
Tell her.

904
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:04,072
Tell him.

905
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:11,646
You tell him. It's your baby.

906
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:18,953
[Clark] I'm gonna be father.

907
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:27,762
[Maggie] Dad. No.

908
01:09:27,764 --> 01:09:29,230
[Martin] You son of a bitch.

909
01:09:29,232 --> 01:09:30,298
[Nadia] Please stop.

910
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:32,233
[Nadia] Stop it.

911
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:47,041
[bells ring]

912
01:10:50,713 --> 01:10:53,181
[Janie] We have
to finish the story.

913
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:55,450
[Christian] They had to
escape, all of them.

914
01:10:55,452 --> 01:10:57,485
[Sam] And get to the boat.

915
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:03,391
[Maggie] OK.

916
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:12,400
[Maggie] She sent them
a message in code.

917
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:23,411
The message said she
would come and visit them

918
01:11:23,413 --> 01:11:26,047
in the middle of the night.

919
01:11:27,082 --> 01:11:29,450
But she couldn't stay.

920
01:12:33,315 --> 01:12:37,852
But, as she slipped
off into the night,

921
01:12:37,854 --> 01:12:40,521
she dropped scraps of cloth

922
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:43,391
Bits and pieces she tore
from her clothes.

923
01:12:43,393 --> 01:12:47,962
and left a trail for
the kids to follow.

924
01:13:12,855 --> 01:13:16,023
It led them to the
edge of a deep hole

925
01:13:16,025 --> 01:13:19,827
so deep they couldn't
see the bottom.

926
01:13:19,829 --> 01:13:23,364
They fell and fell, and

927
01:13:23,366 --> 01:13:28,202
just when they thought they
would never stop falling...

928
01:13:28,204 --> 01:13:30,471
... they landed...

929
01:13:30,473 --> 01:13:34,542
... at the entrance
to a secret tunnel.

930
01:13:34,544 --> 01:13:37,845
And they could hear the
sound of the ocean.

931
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:50,691
[alarm clock sounds]

932
01:15:11,607 --> 01:15:14,809
[Christian] So, they ran
though the tunnel...

933
01:15:14,811 --> 01:15:17,712
[Sam] ... and got
to the boat.

934
01:15:18,547 --> 01:15:21,549
[Janie] ... and pushed
off from the dock.

935
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:26,220
[Maggie] And sailed away...

936
01:15:26,222 --> 01:15:31,225
And they lived
happily ever after.
