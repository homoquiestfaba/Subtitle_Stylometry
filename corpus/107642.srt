1
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,391
- Molly.
- Hey.

2
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:26,369
Sure I can't give you
a ride home?

3
00:08:26,438 --> 00:08:30,135
Oh, thanks, Boone.
Alex is picking me up.

4
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,200
But it's nice of you to ask.

5
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:34,907
Well, it's late.

6
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,572
It's cold.

7
00:08:36,648 --> 00:08:38,775
You think it's a good idea
for you to wait out here alone?

8
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:43,150
- I could wait with you.
- I'll be fine.

9
00:08:44,823 --> 00:08:46,120
Good night, Molly.

10
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:48,216
Good night, Boone.

11
00:08:57,636 --> 00:09:01,094
- Hey, Alex. Thanks.
- No problem.

12
00:09:14,152 --> 00:09:16,518
Alex, take it slow tonight?

13
00:09:16,588 --> 00:09:17,577
Why?

14
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:22,424
I don't know. It's late.
I'm not as alert as I'd like to be.

15
00:09:22,494 --> 00:09:25,224
You're a passenger, Mol.
How alert do you have to be?

16
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:43,541
What's he doing?

17
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:46,406
Winking.

18
00:09:54,326 --> 00:09:55,953
He's getting over.

19
00:10:43,742 --> 00:10:45,039
Alex!

20
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,549
Are you all right?

21
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:38,184
Shit.

22
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,225
Molly.

23
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,135
Molly.

24
00:11:49,207 --> 00:11:51,903
- Are you all right?
- Yeah?

25
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:11,928
Stay here.

26
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,294
I'll go get help.

27
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:52,361
Hey!

28
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,134
Hey! Hey!

29
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:59,002
Hey, damn it, we need help!

30
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,226
No! No!

31
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:26,600
No, please!

32
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:34,667
Alex!

33
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,721
Come back here!

34
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:42,912
...<i>possible hit and run</i>,

35
00:14:42,981 --> 00:14:46,246
<i>Multiple-T.I. Accident</i>
<i>with kill injuries</i>.

36
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:47,945
<i>Officer on scene not involved</i>.

37
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:03,732
Hold it.
Hold it right there.

38
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:10,203
Tunnel's closed.
This is an emergency lane.

39
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:13,039
Will Macklin,
traffic investigator.

40
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:17,737
Okay.

41
00:15:25,523 --> 00:15:26,922
T.I. Coming through.

42
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:29,483
Clear a path, guys.

43
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,431
Come on, get jumping.

44
00:15:33,498 --> 00:15:34,760
You're good. Go ahead.

45
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:51,512
Hey, Jimmy.

46
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:53,740
Bill.

47
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:55,809
- What happened?
- We got a mess.

48
00:15:57,522 --> 00:15:59,456
Come on,
you remember how it was...

49
00:15:59,524 --> 00:16:02,152
it's great to be young and stupid
on a Saturday night.

50
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,195
We've got three vehicles, four bodies,

51
00:16:04,262 --> 00:16:06,059
nothing ticking but their watches.

52
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,828
White female, early 20s.

53
00:16:09,901 --> 00:16:11,801
Talk about a hard-on.

54
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,861
You have a filthy mind, Jimmy.

55
00:16:13,938 --> 00:16:16,133
You ought to transfer to vice.

56
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:22,639
Okay, move it back.

57
00:16:24,482 --> 00:16:26,575
There's a concrete post!

58
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:27,811
We'll have to go low.

59
00:16:31,756 --> 00:16:33,849
Horse trailer must have
gone down first.

60
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:36,689
That's how the animal's walking.
Then this baby comes along. Splat!

61
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:40,424
First on the scene was that guy
over there with the dogs,

62
00:16:40,498 --> 00:16:42,090
but he didn't call it in.

63
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,259
Who did?

64
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,566
Wouldn't leave his name.
Came in on channel nine.

65
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,936
- Nine? C.B.?
- Yeah.

66
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:52,738
- People still use 'em?
- Ten-four.

67
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,469
Hey!

68
00:17:30,548 --> 00:17:32,607
This look like a souvenir shop?

69
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:51,259
Hey... hey!

70
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:54,100
Hey, we got
a survivor here! Hey!

71
00:17:54,172 --> 00:17:56,231
Hey, up here!

72
00:17:56,307 --> 00:17:57,934
Let's go!

73
00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:00,068
Somebody...
get somebody over here!

74
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:57,790
Come in.

75
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:02,128
Molly?

76
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,371
Will Macklin,
state traffic investigator.

77
00:19:06,444 --> 00:19:09,038
She's already said
everything she has to say.

78
00:19:09,113 --> 00:19:11,240
Not to me.

79
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,306
It's okay.

80
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:17,110
- I'll be right outside.
- Okay.

81
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,286
Please, sit.

82
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:29,698
You must feel that we
don't do our job very well

83
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:31,792
for something like this
to happen to you...

84
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,203
...twice.

85
00:19:35,273 --> 00:19:37,207
This isn't the same.

86
00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:38,674
No, of course not.

87
00:19:38,743 --> 00:19:42,736
The other was worse, I'd guess,
losing your family like that.

88
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,543
I've seen it
take down grown men.

89
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,915
You must have been
a tough little girl.

90
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,320
I was just wondering...

91
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,959
What?

92
00:19:57,028 --> 00:19:59,360
...if it wouldn't skew
what you saw,

93
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,057
shade your thinking a little.

94
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:05,628
It shades my life.

95
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:08,228
So it's conceivable
that you got things wrong?

96
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,372
He saw her.

97
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,135
He toyed with her.

98
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:15,438
He killed her,

99
00:20:15,513 --> 00:20:17,640
and then he came after me.

100
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:23,952
Don't suppose you know
anything about skid marks?

101
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:26,615
No.

102
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:29,785
Well, rubber on asphalt
is like ink on paper.

103
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,261
Tires may not
know how to spell,

104
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:36,266
but the marks they leave
are a language, just the same.

105
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:38,268
And what do they say?

106
00:20:38,336 --> 00:20:42,295
There were a lot of people in that tunnel
trying to avoid one another.

107
00:20:42,373 --> 00:20:45,103
One guy
doing just the opposite.

108
00:20:46,177 --> 00:20:48,304
It almost sounds like
you believe me.

109
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:50,279
What are you gonna do about it?

110
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:54,342
Molly,
I'm not a homicide detective.

111
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,785
I don't even carry a gun,
just a measuring tape

112
00:20:56,854 --> 00:20:58,879
and a pencil.

113
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:02,791
I never made an arrest in my life.
Never shot anyone.

114
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,929
You said the vehicle was big.

115
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:11,161
American, maybe.

116
00:21:11,235 --> 00:21:13,669
Old. Possibly green.

117
00:21:14,672 --> 00:21:16,867
What else can you tell me
about it?

118
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:20,333
Filthy.

119
00:21:41,699 --> 00:21:44,964
Okay, let me start by confessing

120
00:21:45,036 --> 00:21:48,904
that I've never actually
been in an accident,

121
00:21:48,973 --> 00:21:50,702
but I know what you're thinking...

122
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:52,698
...feeling.

123
00:21:53,711 --> 00:21:56,202
You're saying to yourself,
"Why me?"

124
00:21:57,281 --> 00:22:00,409
Yes, well,
it didn't just happen to you.

125
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,612
In America,

126
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:06,919
300 of us are seriously injured
in a motor vehicle accident

127
00:22:06,991 --> 00:22:08,288
every hour.

128
00:22:09,293 --> 00:22:12,387
That's over 8,000 of us a day,

129
00:22:12,463 --> 00:22:14,761
250,000 a month.

130
00:22:14,832 --> 00:22:17,858
That's over three million a year.

131
00:22:17,935 --> 00:22:21,735
50,000 of us die.

132
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:26,640
The person next to you,
take their hand.

133
00:22:28,446 --> 00:22:29,538
Take it.

134
00:22:30,114 --> 00:22:32,241
Come on, take it.

135
00:22:32,316 --> 00:22:34,147
That's it.

136
00:22:34,218 --> 00:22:35,981
I want you to do something
for me.

137
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:42,551
I want you to say,
"I am not alone."

138
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:47,030
Say it with me.
"I am not alone."

139
00:22:47,098 --> 00:22:48,087
Good. Again.

140
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:52,000
I am not alone.

141
00:22:52,503 --> 00:22:54,403
What happened to me
happened once.

142
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,735
Pardon?

143
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,416
Not 8,000 times a day.
One time.

144
00:23:08,152 --> 00:23:10,985
I understand what you're feeling.

145
00:23:16,761 --> 00:23:18,023
Excuse me.

146
00:23:19,897 --> 00:23:24,129
Okay, see? That's what happens
when we put up the barricades.

147
00:23:34,545 --> 00:23:36,445
Sorry.

148
00:23:41,352 --> 00:23:42,512
About what?

149
00:23:43,087 --> 00:23:45,282
About whatever brought you here.

150
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,622
How did yours happen?

151
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,788
Hit and run.

152
00:23:54,932 --> 00:23:56,729
Me too.

153
00:23:59,637 --> 00:24:01,366
Did they catch the person?

154
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,100
No, they didn't.

155
00:24:07,645 --> 00:24:09,112
I have to be somewhere.

156
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:13,406
Can I give you a ride?

157
00:24:13,484 --> 00:24:15,179
Somebody's meeting me.

158
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:16,550
What about later?

159
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:19,989
It's kind of a bad time.

160
00:24:20,057 --> 00:24:22,685
I didn't say
we'd enjoy ourselves.

161
00:24:23,761 --> 00:24:25,160
You promise?

162
00:24:25,229 --> 00:24:27,254
We'll be pitiful.

163
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:32,291
I'll be back next week,
and if you're here, then we'll see.

164
00:24:37,341 --> 00:24:38,899
Wasn't an accident, Molly.

165
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:42,511
He knew what he was doing.

166
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,172
What are you talking about?

167
00:24:44,248 --> 00:24:48,014
He drives a 1972
Cadillac El Dorado, pepper green.

168
00:24:48,085 --> 00:24:49,950
I believe you know the car.

169
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,613
If you know something
about what happened to me,

170
00:24:51,689 --> 00:24:53,384
take it to the police.

171
00:24:53,457 --> 00:24:54,515
They can't help us.

172
00:24:54,592 --> 00:24:57,254
You don't think
I've tried that before?

173
00:24:57,328 --> 00:24:58,625
No police.

174
00:24:58,696 --> 00:25:00,721
Did he take
something of yours?

175
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:02,060
What do you mean?

176
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:04,761
Are you missing something,
something to remember you by?

177
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,100
He always takes a souvenir.

178
00:25:09,473 --> 00:25:10,906
He took my picture.

179
00:25:12,276 --> 00:25:14,608
If I can find you, so can he.

180
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,738
He's coming back, Molly.

181
00:25:16,814 --> 00:25:18,975
You're his only mistake.

182
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:30,020
11:00, Orchestra Hall.

183
00:26:31,455 --> 00:26:33,787
I think you and I
had better talk.

184
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:39,227
Hey! Son of a bitch! Damn!

185
00:27:00,117 --> 00:27:02,483
This is traffic unit 48.

186
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,847
I've got a pursuit,
could use some backup.

187
00:27:05,923 --> 00:27:07,686
<i>- Identify yourself</i>.
- Macklin.

188
00:27:07,758 --> 00:27:08,918
<i>Who?</i>

189
00:27:08,993 --> 00:27:11,052
Will Macklin,
Traffic Investigations.

190
00:27:11,128 --> 00:27:12,527
<i>Stand by</i>.

191
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:15,621
Shit!

192
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:21,462
Never mind.

193
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:40,988
The tunnel's coming up.
Maybe we should go around.

194
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,154
Let's go around.

195
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:47,987
Thanks, Boone.

196
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:25,060
Boone!

197
00:29:44,281 --> 00:29:45,270
Boone.

198
00:29:46,383 --> 00:29:48,851
Boone, can you move?

199
00:30:17,815 --> 00:30:20,340
Boone! Boone!

200
00:30:47,945 --> 00:30:49,276
No!

201
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:56,339
No! Hold it!

202
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,121
Come on!

203
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,460
Grab my hand!

204
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,064
Look at me! Look at me!

205
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,834
- Now!
- No!

206
00:32:45,062 --> 00:32:46,586
<i>Cray</i>.

207
00:32:47,831 --> 00:32:49,162
<i>You want another shot at me?</i>

208
00:32:50,934 --> 00:32:52,595
<i>Have the girl out here</i>
<i>tomorrow night</i>.

209
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:59,641
<i>It's simple</i>.
<i>I want her. You want me</i>.

210
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:01,244
<i>Use her</i>.

211
00:33:07,651 --> 00:33:10,176
- We'll be here.
<i>- Very good</i>.

212
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:12,950
<i>Another 100.000 miles of this</i>,
<i>and you'll be</i>

213
00:33:13,023 --> 00:33:14,854
just like me.

214
00:33:27,504 --> 00:33:31,668
Let me out.
I have to help my friend.

215
00:33:32,676 --> 00:33:34,610
Molly, your friend's dead,

216
00:33:34,678 --> 00:33:38,307
and like I said before, no police.

217
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:55,293
Any sign of the girl?

218
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,356
<i>Nada</i>.

219
00:33:57,434 --> 00:33:58,958
The guy in the Barracuda?

220
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:03,905
Well, his plates were stolen
three weeks ago in Indiana, and...

221
00:34:03,974 --> 00:34:05,066
What?

222
00:34:06,143 --> 00:34:07,405
He's missing a door.

223
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:57,716
Please.

224
00:35:14,077 --> 00:35:15,601
What do you want with me?

225
00:35:20,217 --> 00:35:22,617
You're not seriously considering
going back out there.

226
00:35:22,686 --> 00:35:24,779
I'm not considering.
We'll be there.

227
00:35:24,855 --> 00:35:26,447
No, we won't.

228
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:31,225
I am not getting back in that car.

229
00:35:35,232 --> 00:35:36,665
What happened to you?

230
00:35:39,503 --> 00:35:41,562
He killed someone
close to you, didn't he?

231
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,565
Who did he run down?

232
00:35:58,388 --> 00:35:59,719
Stop!

233
00:36:02,092 --> 00:36:03,616
Am I gonna die?

234
00:36:19,476 --> 00:36:20,465
My wife.

235
00:36:26,149 --> 00:36:27,844
He ran over my wife.

236
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:26,476
He always takes a souvenir?

237
00:37:30,247 --> 00:37:32,909
He convinced them
it was an accident.

238
00:37:33,984 --> 00:37:36,817
That she was standing
in the road.

239
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:41,017
That he ran
because I went after him.

240
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,029
I did three years...

241
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:25,029
...and he spent
the next 18 months in the hospital.

242
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:27,366
They rebuilt him
from the ground up.

243
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:30,067
Then one day
his bed was empty.

244
00:38:31,074 --> 00:38:34,202
Month later, I got the first
of I don't know how many letters.

245
00:38:35,812 --> 00:38:38,975
Press clippings of his accidents.

246
00:38:39,049 --> 00:38:42,177
From all over the map.
Totally random.

247
00:38:43,186 --> 00:38:44,585
Just like yours.

248
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:45,986
Most of them recent.

249
00:38:47,824 --> 00:38:48,813
Most?

250
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:52,187
He'd been doing this
for a while.

251
00:38:53,263 --> 00:38:56,892
Nine women.
Three before Olivia.

252
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:59,265
Why didn't you tell the police?

253
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:00,394
I did.

254
00:39:01,738 --> 00:39:03,899
But they're just
hit-and-runs to the police,

255
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:06,602
and usually
a thousand miles apart.

256
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:11,114
They don't have the imagination
to link them to one man.

257
00:39:13,183 --> 00:39:15,014
Did you mean to hit him?

258
00:39:15,085 --> 00:39:18,020
I didn't know much
about driving back then.

259
00:39:19,122 --> 00:39:22,216
You know,
it's basic obstacle avoidance.

260
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:24,886
You're not supposed to look
at the thing that you're trying to avoid

261
00:39:24,961 --> 00:39:27,293
or you'll drive right into it.

262
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:31,424
All I know is...

263
00:39:33,603 --> 00:39:35,400
...I was looking at him.

264
00:39:57,961 --> 00:39:59,861
That door
get over here yet?

265
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:00,919
Door?

266
00:40:02,165 --> 00:40:05,498
Oh, yeah.
You mean the '68. Sure.

267
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,733
Check this out.

268
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,680
"For use in supervised
acceleration trials.

269
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,012
Not intended for highway use."

270
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:24,076
Barracuda, Super Stock 426,
heavy package.

271
00:40:24,154 --> 00:40:26,554
Only about 50, 60 ever shipped.

272
00:40:26,623 --> 00:40:29,421
The body's been acid-dipped,
for weight.

273
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:31,850
Check this out.

274
00:40:36,266 --> 00:40:37,858
There's no sound deadener.

275
00:40:40,103 --> 00:40:41,661
It's not what you'd call
street legal.

276
00:40:41,738 --> 00:40:45,367
Put her on a drag strip,
she'll lay down some serious rubber.

277
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:48,504
Man, I'd love to get my hands
on the rest of her.

278
00:40:49,579 --> 00:40:50,773
Yeah, so would I.

279
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:53,774
Hmph, something else.

280
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:56,609
Look at the tiny magnet
on that thing.

281
00:40:56,686 --> 00:40:58,620
It's not for voice only...

282
00:40:58,688 --> 00:41:01,748
scanner, two-way radio,
C.B., stuff like that.

283
00:41:03,193 --> 00:41:04,956
That mean something to you?

284
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:06,928
Maybe.

285
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:09,591
Someone I'm looking for
uses a C.B.

286
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:12,032
Well, congratulations.

287
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:13,626
You've arrested his door.

288
00:41:15,705 --> 00:41:18,003
Wally, can you
hook me up with a C.B.?

289
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:21,167
Yeah, I got a nice little
40-channel number,

290
00:41:21,244 --> 00:41:23,542
single side band,
voice lock, dynamic squelch.

291
00:41:23,613 --> 00:41:25,638
How's that grab you?

292
00:41:25,715 --> 00:41:28,183
If that's a C.B., I'll take it.

293
00:41:43,433 --> 00:41:45,731
You've done this before.

294
00:41:45,802 --> 00:41:48,134
A long time ago.

295
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:50,195
You're a doctor?

296
00:41:52,709 --> 00:41:54,040
It's just what I was.

297
00:41:59,716 --> 00:42:02,810
Here's a... shirt.

298
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,612
And, uh...

299
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:10,050
...some other things,
if you need 'em.

300
00:42:11,828 --> 00:42:13,056
Thank you.

301
00:42:25,842 --> 00:42:27,571
Could you turn around?

302
00:42:36,753 --> 00:42:38,687
So, what was he
before all of this?

303
00:42:39,923 --> 00:42:41,117
Insurance.

304
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:44,092
He worked out of
a little bungalow in Oakland.

305
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:47,689
Mostly automobile coverage.

306
00:42:47,764 --> 00:42:50,164
Dealing with smashups all day

307
00:42:50,233 --> 00:42:52,701
could be where he
picked up a taste for it.

308
00:42:54,537 --> 00:42:56,801
Definitely where he learned
how to get away with it.

309
00:42:59,709 --> 00:43:01,040
It happened to you, too.

310
00:43:03,246 --> 00:43:04,577
A car did that.

311
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:07,814
When you were a kid.

312
00:43:13,323 --> 00:43:15,314
Who was driving,
your mom or your dad?

313
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:21,524
Dad.

314
00:43:21,598 --> 00:43:22,997
Did he make it?

315
00:43:26,703 --> 00:43:28,637
What about your mom?

316
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:36,704
I can't drive because of it.

317
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:41,645
Can't get over the fear
that I'll screw up

318
00:43:41,718 --> 00:43:44,312
and make another little girl
an orphan.

319
00:43:44,387 --> 00:43:47,652
We have a lot in common,
you and me.

320
00:43:47,724 --> 00:43:50,716
I can't go out there again.

321
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,661
He disappears for three,
four months at a time.

322
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:55,960
I'd have to start over again.

323
00:43:56,032 --> 00:43:57,693
I can't do it.

324
00:43:58,768 --> 00:44:01,931
He'd be halfway across the country
right now if it weren't for you.

325
00:44:02,005 --> 00:44:04,439
Molly, he killed two of your friends

326
00:44:04,507 --> 00:44:06,202
without so much
as getting a speeding ticket.

327
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:08,767
- I know what he did.
- Then help me.

328
00:44:10,313 --> 00:44:11,712
I can't.

329
00:44:15,151 --> 00:44:17,517
There's something
I can't do, either.

330
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:20,412
I can't let you go.

331
00:44:58,461 --> 00:45:00,452
<i>- Will</i>.
- I'm here.

332
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:03,931
<i>Okay. There are only 25</i>
<i>heavy Barracudas still registered</i>.

333
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,797
<i>One model matching description</i>.

334
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,394
<i>Owner of record</i>.
<i>Cray. Renford James</i>.

335
00:45:08,471 --> 00:45:10,564
<i>Did three years</i>
<i>for aggravated assault</i>.

336
00:45:12,442 --> 00:45:14,740
<i>Guess what he used</i>
<i>for a weapon</i>.

337
00:45:14,811 --> 00:45:16,472
His car.

338
00:45:36,132 --> 00:45:37,292
<i>Cray</i>.

339
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,331
<i>Are you there?</i>

340
00:45:42,405 --> 00:45:46,000
<i>I was thinking of</i>
<i>heading out west after this one</i>.

341
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,271
<i>Try our luck</i>
<i>on one of the super slabs</i>,

342
00:45:48,344 --> 00:45:52,110
<i>The I-10. maybe the 70</i>,
<i>past all those Pizza Huts</i>.

343
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:56,346
<i>7-11s. K-Marts</i>,
<i>all those chain cities</i>.

344
00:45:57,821 --> 00:45:59,948
<i>And all those girls</i>.

345
00:46:01,591 --> 00:46:07,655
<i>You know, she takes</i>
<i>a pretty good picture, our Molly</i>.

346
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:13,134
<i>I wonedr if she's thinking of me</i>
<i>as much as I'm thinking of her</i>.

347
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:16,195
<i>You should let me</i>
<i>finish her, Cray</i>.

348
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:18,936
<i>You know I'm going to</i>.

349
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:23,177
<i>Sooner, later</i>...

350
00:46:24,247 --> 00:46:27,910
...<i>with you, without you</i>.

351
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,994
You know what
the head shrinkers call this?

352
00:46:48,671 --> 00:46:50,400
Exposure therapy.

353
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:54,435
I know.

354
00:46:59,849 --> 00:47:02,875
When the body's doing something
it doesn't want to do...

355
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,587
...it tightens up.

356
00:47:05,655 --> 00:47:09,682
You lose feeling
in your hands, your legs.

357
00:47:09,759 --> 00:47:11,056
You can't steer.

358
00:47:12,128 --> 00:47:13,322
You can't shift.

359
00:47:16,332 --> 00:47:18,197
Turn the key.

360
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,238
Is that him?

361
00:48:31,307 --> 00:48:34,640
No. His headlights
are like his eyes.

362
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:36,611
Only one works.

363
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:42,246
His body is his car.

364
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:46,654
Stop his car, stop him.

365
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:52,684
All we have to do is husk
the slug right out of his shell.

366
00:49:07,076 --> 00:49:08,065
What?

367
00:49:09,779 --> 00:49:11,110
I'm not sure.

368
00:49:23,459 --> 00:49:24,448
Listen.

369
00:49:41,744 --> 00:49:45,874
<i>Cray, do you have her?</i>
<i>Is she with you?</i>

370
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:49,347
<i>Yeah, She's here</i>.

371
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:00,490
He's coming.

372
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:48,970
Shit!

373
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:51,605
God damn!

374
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:31,106
Rennie!

375
00:52:38,354 --> 00:52:39,912
Rennie!

376
00:53:32,174 --> 00:53:33,903
Renford James Cray!

377
00:53:37,046 --> 00:53:38,343
Kill the engine.

378
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:42,980
Listen to me carefully, 'cause
I only have time to say this once.

379
00:53:43,052 --> 00:53:46,180
The fellow you're after
drives a '72 Cadillac El Dorado.

380
00:53:46,255 --> 00:53:47,950
He's got a two-minute head start.

381
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:51,187
Step out of my way,
I make that time up no problem.

382
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:53,785
- Turn it off.
- Three-minute head start.

383
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:55,694
I said turn it off!

384
00:53:55,765 --> 00:53:57,960
The only way I'm gonna find out
what's going on is to keep...

385
00:53:58,034 --> 00:53:59,797
...one of you off the road...
- Move!

386
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:01,336
...long enough to fill me in!

387
00:54:20,756 --> 00:54:22,553
<i>Cray, pick up</i>.

388
00:54:23,626 --> 00:54:25,059
<i>Pick up, Cray</i>.

389
00:54:26,128 --> 00:54:27,322
<i>I know you're there</i>.

390
00:54:31,667 --> 00:54:33,100
Is she still alive?

391
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:35,262
<i>I'm not sure</i>.

392
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:36,600
Just tell me!

393
00:54:36,672 --> 00:54:37,764
<i>Let me check</i>.

394
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,866
<i>No! Rennie! No!</i>

395
00:54:40,943 --> 00:54:41,967
Fargo!

396
00:54:47,516 --> 00:54:48,505
Fargo.

397
00:54:48,584 --> 00:54:52,714
Would someone please tell me
what the fuck is going on?

398
00:54:53,789 --> 00:54:56,280
Yeah. First help me
find a radiator.

399
00:56:27,216 --> 00:56:29,912
Do you have any idea
where we're going,

400
00:56:29,985 --> 00:56:31,816
or you just driving?

401
00:56:31,887 --> 00:56:34,219
Been tracking him
for two years.

402
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:37,487
Yeah, I have some idea.

403
00:56:40,496 --> 00:56:42,259
You're just driving.

404
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:50,104
He prefers major highways.

405
00:56:50,172 --> 00:56:51,764
See, he likes to speed.

406
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:54,275
With fall coming,
he'll stick pretty much

407
00:56:54,343 --> 00:56:56,607
to the western/southwestern
states.

408
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:59,614
He has a sixth sense
for hick towns with speed traps

409
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:01,650
and manages to avoid them.

410
00:57:01,717 --> 00:57:04,208
He loves tunnels,
drive-thru restaurants.

411
00:57:04,286 --> 00:57:05,719
He hates drawbridges,

412
00:57:05,788 --> 00:57:08,586
will go miles out of his way
to avoid one.

413
00:57:08,657 --> 00:57:10,090
Used to stop for repairs, too,

414
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:13,060
but he's gotten pretty good
at taking care of that himself.

415
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:16,064
You can patch a punctured lung
just as easily as a flat tire.

416
00:57:18,634 --> 00:57:20,158
Why does he do it?

417
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:23,171
He just does it.
Isn't that enough?

418
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:26,572
No, man. If I'm supposed
to help, I need to know more.

419
00:57:26,642 --> 00:57:29,611
His father had
a little auto insurance business.

420
00:57:30,813 --> 00:57:32,906
He used to show his kid
wreck photos.

421
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:38,079
Bodies, smashed faces,
decapitations.

422
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:41,590
Kid collected them, and he went
to work for his father.

423
00:57:41,657 --> 00:57:43,420
Soon that wasn't enough.

424
00:57:43,492 --> 00:57:47,553
He started creating his own pictures
with the accidents he caused.

425
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:50,531
Why Molly? I mean,
how does he choose these women?

426
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:52,260
It's completely random.

427
00:57:53,669 --> 00:57:56,638
He drives for hours, playing out
different scenarios in his head

428
00:57:56,705 --> 00:58:00,163
until he has to act, then he just
looks for an opportunity.

429
00:58:00,242 --> 00:58:02,073
You know, an empty highway or...

430
00:58:03,779 --> 00:58:05,269
...a woman by herself.

431
00:58:07,449 --> 00:58:10,213
So, a killer
who leaves no fingerprints,

432
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:11,719
no DNA,

433
00:58:11,787 --> 00:58:14,221
and he drives off
in the murder weapon.

434
00:58:16,458 --> 00:58:18,392
And only you know about it.

435
00:58:19,962 --> 00:58:20,951
And you.

436
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:30,064
Have you ever seen him?
Up close, I mean.

437
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:33,130
Twice.

438
00:58:35,477 --> 00:58:36,774
Last night.

439
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:38,643
Five years ago.

440
00:58:41,483 --> 00:58:42,916
The day he killed my wife.

441
00:58:45,821 --> 00:58:48,085
He looked exactly
like what he was...

442
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:50,421
a middle-aged insurance salesman

443
00:58:50,492 --> 00:58:53,757
that no one
would pay attention to.

444
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:56,395
Ordinary face.

445
00:58:57,399 --> 00:58:58,764
Forgettable.

446
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:03,866
Except you can't forget it.

447
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:06,532
Let me tell you something.

448
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:09,601
Outside that Caddie,
he is nothing.

449
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:12,444
You separate the mind
from the machine...

450
00:59:13,782 --> 00:59:14,771
And what?

451
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:18,780
You can go home.

452
00:59:35,804 --> 00:59:37,066
What?

453
00:59:37,139 --> 00:59:40,040
Not sure. Something.

454
01:00:12,174 --> 01:00:13,607
It's morphine sulfate.

455
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:33,694
She's alive.

456
01:00:33,762 --> 01:00:35,753
I don't understand.
How can you tell?

457
01:00:35,831 --> 01:00:38,095
That's what he's telling us.

458
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:47,904
He's also telling us
where he's taken her.

459
01:00:48,477 --> 01:00:49,466
Where?

460
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:52,140
About four hundred miles
or so...

461
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:55,980
...across a couple of states.

462
01:00:57,553 --> 01:00:59,783
It's where
he's gonna kill her.

463
01:01:18,974 --> 01:01:20,771
You know where we are?

464
01:01:23,245 --> 01:01:26,180
I got it for a good price.

465
01:01:26,248 --> 01:01:28,614
Insurance money.

466
01:01:38,827 --> 01:01:40,590
You know what that is?

467
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:45,193
There's a lot of me
still in that car.

468
01:01:47,369 --> 01:01:50,702
If you look close,
you can see bone.

469
01:02:03,318 --> 01:02:04,649
Check the glove box.

470
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,325
Pictures.

471
01:02:25,874 --> 01:02:27,307
This your wife?

472
01:02:29,678 --> 01:02:30,872
Keep looking.

473
01:02:34,616 --> 01:02:36,481
There. That one.

474
01:02:39,521 --> 01:02:41,853
It was taken
the day he killed her.

475
01:02:43,592 --> 01:02:45,958
For revenge,
he's gonna do it again.

476
01:04:07,409 --> 01:04:10,469
There's one thing about me
Fargo's always depended on.

477
01:04:10,546 --> 01:04:11,740
What's that?

478
01:04:13,315 --> 01:04:14,475
I'd come alone.

479
01:04:16,151 --> 01:04:17,709
He'll be expecting me.

480
01:04:17,786 --> 01:04:20,118
Won't be expecting you.

481
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:30,427
Is there a REACT unit
monitoring this channel?

482
01:04:33,068 --> 01:04:35,332
This is a police emergency.

483
01:04:36,738 --> 01:04:40,174
I'm at a motel
somewhere near the state line.

484
01:04:43,011 --> 01:04:44,069
Towers Motel.

485
01:04:46,081 --> 01:04:48,345
Anyone. Anyo...

486
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:10,768
I need to be sure of something.

487
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,402
You've been on this highway
a long time,

488
01:05:14,476 --> 01:05:16,307
and that can change a man.

489
01:05:18,213 --> 01:05:21,512
I need to be sure that when the
time comes, you can change back.

490
01:05:23,585 --> 01:05:25,416
What are you asking?

491
01:05:30,993 --> 01:05:33,985
We're here to save a life,
not commit homicide.

492
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:36,695
Right?

493
01:07:17,866 --> 01:07:20,164
Right there is good, Cray!

494
01:07:20,235 --> 01:07:22,669
- Rennie!
- I said there!

495
01:08:08,183 --> 01:08:10,014
Go. Go.

496
01:15:54,015 --> 01:15:57,576
Who are you supposed to be?

497
01:15:58,653 --> 01:16:00,314
Will Macklin.

498
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:04,123
State traffic investigator.
