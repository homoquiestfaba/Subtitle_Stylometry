00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,699

Just slow down, man.

301
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:43,034

      from the beginning.

302

      for the hunter's--

303
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:46,370
Yeah, yeah,
and we came across

304
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:48,973
the remains
of a shark attack

305
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:51,275
and saw the marks
on the ice

306
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:53,444
where he was dragged
into the water.

307
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:58,649
And, um, his fingernail
stuck in the ice.

308
00:21:58,718 --> 00:22:00,384
       And that's when
       the shark attacked us.

309
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:04,522
       And we left a snowmobile
                    on the ice.

310
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,690
           Well, forget about
           that snowmobile.

311
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,124
                 What--What did
           the shark look like?

312
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:09,527
   It--It looked
   like a Greenland.

313
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:12,763
          A Greenie?
      That's impossible.

314
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,199
       They're hundreds
       of miles south of here.

315
00:22:15,268 --> 00:22:16,767
               I know,

316
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,536
           but it sure
           smelled like one.

317
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:20,604

            Yeah.

       the, uh--their flesh
       is rich in uric acid.

319
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,777
     It makes them stink
          like piss.

TRACY: Exactly.

321
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:30,481
And the teeth I found
were similar,

322
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,749
just a lot sharper.

323
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:33,084
     Doesn't make sense.
        I mean, the--

324
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:34,919
       the Greenies, they
       don't move like that.

325
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:37,855
       They're clumsy animals.
       They almost lumber
       through the ocean.

326
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:40,491
  Feel free to take that up
  with the shark, all right?

327
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,860
I mean, clearly these
are a fast, aggressive

328

that have evolved
from the Greenlands.

       have got trapped here

332
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:56,874

       after the last ice age.

333
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:58,976
           With so little food,
                  they probably

334
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,878
                  had to become
           the dominant species

335
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:03,614
   and stalk prey
   like polar bears
   and other things

336
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:05,583

  to the edge of the water.

      there haven't been
     any recorded events?

           that's been melting,

       this far south,

Whatever it is,

345
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:41,051

we give the moon pool
a wide berth.

           I'm just going
           to stay out of

347
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:47,591
       We also need to get
       on the radio and warn
       Sammy about the sharks

348
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,860
         so he knows
       what to look for
       on the way back.

       I'll also radio Aput and
   let them know what we found.

We're okay,
but we have a theory

356

about what's happening
to the hunters.

it's shark attacks.

at that for now,

that people,

to the water's edge
is their prey.
