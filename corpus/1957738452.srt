1
00:00:02,236 --> 00:00:05,540
(soft chiming music)

2
00:00:15,783 --> 00:00:18,185
(fly buzzing)

3
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:21,388
(fly splattering)

4
00:00:24,659 --> 00:00:27,494
(water dripping)

5
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:43,377
(music box clicking)

6
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:51,418
(cheerful music box music)

7
00:01:11,706 --> 00:01:14,742
(suspenseful music)

8
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:27,220
(water splashing softly)

9
00:01:28,056 --> 00:01:31,291
(suspenseful music)

10
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,495
(water splashing softly)

11
00:01:35,597 --> 00:01:38,566
(door creaking)

12
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:41,769
(dramatic crescendo)

13
00:01:42,804 --> 00:01:45,673
(thrilling music)

14
00:01:55,817 --> 00:01:58,853
(crickets chirping)

15
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:04,458
- Let me call myself
for the moment, William.

16
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:09,329
I'm a storyteller by nature
and a liar in my freer times.

17
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:11,699
No part of what I convey is true,

18
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,935
but every part is truthful.

19
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:17,304
You will come to despise
me and your revulsion

20
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,907
will be rightly warranted, I swear it.

21
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:22,342
Now, however,

22
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:26,114
by way of staying execution and
mitigating these accusations

23
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:30,150
against me, I offer this sad history.

24
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,921
(tense music)

25
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:43,965
Most abhor my commitment to
pretension and inconsistency,

26
00:02:44,065 --> 00:02:46,067
but I implore you, listen.

27
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,869
Only then might you understand completel

28
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:51,238
I hated the old man.

29
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,776
It's not that he had
wronged me or given insult.

30
00:02:54,876 --> 00:02:58,245
Those things I'd come to
accept as a matter of course.

31
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,614
I think it was his

32
00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:03,918
breath.

33
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:08,690
(man breathing heavily)

34
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,693
That shallow rasp of a man
on the edge of a maelstrom.

35
00:03:11,793 --> 00:03:14,662
Too weak-spirited to indulge
his nobler instincts.

36
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:17,699
Desperately grasping within
the darkness for deliverance

37
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:21,268
from the inescapable and
ever-present specter of death.

38
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:30,778
I became terrified he'd
find miraculous salvation,

39
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,314
shake the noose once more,
become somewhat his former self.

40
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,853
And the whole miserable
ordeal would begin again.

41
00:03:39,554 --> 00:03:41,321
(distant clock ticking)

42
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,659
(crickets chirping)

43
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:52,499
(loud banging)

44
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:02,977
(water splashing)

45
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:08,516
It is impossible to say how the
idea first entered my brain,

46
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:13,286
but once conceived, it possessed me.

47
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:21,028
(man breathing heavily)
(door creaking)

48
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,506
(suspenseful music)

49
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,375
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

50
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:36,878
Before I continue,

51
00:04:36,978 --> 00:04:39,914
I must first impart my
breathless impression

52
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:42,784
of that singular element to the
story that quickens my heart

53
00:04:42,884 --> 00:04:45,753
and awakens my better
nature, assuming I have one.

54
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:52,359
Let me lift your gaze to her.

55
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:56,496
(solemn music)

56
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:01,836
- Hi.

57
00:05:03,004 --> 00:05:04,505
I'm here to see Mr. Usher.

58
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:11,779
(sphygmomanometer inflating)

59
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,551
(solemn instrumental music)

60
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:22,590
(pen scratching)

61
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,126
He won't be needing the blood thinners

62
00:05:25,226 --> 00:05:27,795
or the chemo medication anymore.

63
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:30,497
We'll be replacing those
with the morphine drip.

64
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:33,968
Now, keep this away from
all the other injections.

65
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:35,703
It's pretty strong stuff.

66
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:37,505
And everything else just give to him

67
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:39,574
as you normally would, okay?

68
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:43,644
All right, now I need you to sign this.

69
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:45,445
This just states that
we went over everything

70
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:47,548
and that you understand.

71
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,382
Do you have any other questions?

72
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,986
- When will he be going
back to the oncologist?

73
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:57,658
- He won't be going back to the doctor.

74
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,929
I need you to understand that I'm not he

75
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:02,997
to make him better.

76
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:05,099
I'm here to make him comfortable.

77
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:08,836
Did the two of you talk about
this before you decided to--

78
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:09,837
- Yes.

79
00:06:10,905 --> 00:06:11,806
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,075
It's just a lot to take in.

81
00:06:14,175 --> 00:06:15,176
- No, I understand.

82
00:06:15,276 --> 00:06:16,376
Take your time.

83
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:20,548
- How long does he have?

84
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:23,251
- A few months?

85
00:06:23,351 --> 00:06:24,585
- Will he get worse?

86
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:28,990
- Yes.

87
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,391
We'll give him some strong
medicine to help with the pain,

88
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,762
but I'm afraid it'll make him less lucid

89
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:40,400
Of course, if you're having
second thoughts about this,

90
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,203
then the two of you
should really talk about--

91
00:06:42,303 --> 00:06:44,906
- No, thank you.

92
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:47,708
I understand.

93
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:54,081
The idea that my love for her
in as much as I am capable

94
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:57,852
of feeling such emotion would
begin at our first moment

95
00:06:57,952 --> 00:07:01,589
of somber introduction is
the substance of delusion.

96
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:06,426
Still, I cannot with
quiet conscience deny it.

97
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:10,031
We set about the comfort of the old man

98
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:12,867
and that alone we
pursued with pious vigor.

99
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:15,503
Never would our eyes meet
or our pulses quicken

100
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:17,605
at the sight of the other.

101
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:20,741
Never would we smile or swoon or sigh.

102
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:23,945
We would instead passionately
declare the depths

103
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:26,847
of the love which we
both felt most assuredly,

104
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:30,251
and as a matter of absolute
certitude for the old man,

105
00:07:30,351 --> 00:07:33,287
and yet the sympathies of a
scarcely-intelligible nature

106
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:35,056
existed between us.

107
00:07:37,425 --> 00:07:38,993
We would find ourselves stealing away,

108
00:07:39,093 --> 00:07:41,429
always in the interest of
respect for the old man,

109
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:43,496
for no dutiful son or
physician's assistant

110
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:45,433
would discuss the tragedy of a man's

111
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:47,735
absolute and incontrovertible death

112
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:51,272
within 100 yards earshot
of the hero himself.

113
00:07:51,372 --> 00:07:52,773
(man breathing heavily)

114
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:56,811
(somber instrumental music)

115
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:59,347
(music box clicking)

116
00:07:59,447 --> 00:08:02,850
(soft music box music)

117
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,267
(lips smacking)

118
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,904
Thanks for coming by.

119
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:36,183
(shoes clacking)

120
00:08:40,421 --> 00:08:42,256
Then it was finished.

121
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,928
- Hi, I'm here to see Mr. Usher.

122
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,400
(dogs barking)

123
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,701
- Where's Anna?

124
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:55,536
- Oh, Anna cut back on some of her cases

125
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:58,072
and I'm taking a few of
her patients for her.

126
00:09:00,441 --> 00:09:01,642
Can I come in?

127
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:08,783
(crickets chirping)

128
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,589
(rotary phone clicking)

129
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:26,867
(phone ringing)

130
00:09:29,437 --> 00:09:30,805
- [Anna] Hello?

131
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:32,473
- Hey.

132
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:33,941
I missed you today.

133
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,144
Where were you?

134
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,414
- [Anna] William, I'm sorry.

135
00:09:40,515 --> 00:09:43,651
I can't care for Mr. Usher at this time.

136
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:45,653
- But he loved you, I mean--

137
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:46,887
- [Anna] I'm so sorry.

138
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,690
I just don't think it
would be appropriate.

139
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,625
I hope you understand.

140
00:09:52,527 --> 00:09:53,627
- I don't.

141
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:55,930
- [Anna] I'm sorry, William.

142
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,398
I have to go.

143
00:09:57,498 --> 00:09:58,866
Give him my love, okay?

144
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:01,302
I'm sorry.

145
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:08,342
(phone receiver bangs)

146
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:12,113
(William sighs)

147
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:17,651
- And thus joy suddenly faded into horro

148
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:21,188
and the most beautiful
became the most hideous.

149
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:26,327
(water splashing)

150
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:29,763
I continued my endeavors
of faithfulness, tending,

151
00:10:29,864 --> 00:10:31,799
with the help of the
nameless nurse who scurried

152
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,701
and busied herself as a soulless beast

153
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:35,336
in preparation of his demise

154
00:10:35,436 --> 00:10:37,606
to the old man's every want and need

155
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:40,774
and principle of
arrogant, entitled desire.

156
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:44,044
It was now that my hatred
for him blossomed and bloomed

157
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:46,413
as a cancer of thought and obsession.

158
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:48,583
(vibrant violin music)

159
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:51,986
He who through unholy
fate brought us together

160
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:53,787
and with some gleeful aspiration,

161
00:10:53,888 --> 00:10:56,190
I know not the particulars
of how nor do I care,

162
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,393
drove her from that accursed
house of false modesty.

163
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,564
I longed with the most
earnest and consuming desire

164
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:04,398
for the old man's decease.

165
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:05,833
I refuse to deny it.

166
00:11:06,568 --> 00:11:08,169
(water splashing)

167
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:11,205
But the obstinate spirit
clung to its tenement

168
00:11:11,305 --> 00:11:12,740
of clay for many days,

169
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,643
through many weeks and irksome months

170
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:18,279
until my hatred obtained
a mastery over my mind.

171
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:20,414
And I grew furious through delay

172
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:21,849
and with the heart of a fiend

173
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:24,285
to curse the days and the
hours and the bitter moments,

174
00:11:24,385 --> 00:11:28,222
which seemed to lengthen and
lengthen as his despicable life

175
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:31,325
declined like shadows
in the dying of the day.

176
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:33,628
(glass shattering)

177
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:37,097
(clock ticking rapidly)

178
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:40,034
(blood dripping)

179
00:11:40,935 --> 00:11:46,173
(soft music box music)
(man snoring softly)

180
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:53,480
(switch clicking)

181
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:55,482
- [Mr. Usher] William.

182
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,419
- I'm here.

183
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:05,459
(door creaking)

184
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,894
(tense violin music)

185
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:10,130
(water splashing)

186
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:13,500
There was not a singular moment
when the task was decided.

187
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:15,604
Instead, the fate of the old man unwound

188
00:12:15,704 --> 00:12:17,304
as a fable whose gruesome conclusion

189
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:21,809
is both hideously unnecessary
and fully predetermined.

190
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:24,912
Once the plan had thus matured,

191
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:27,881
over the course of weeks or
months absolutely unknown

192
00:12:27,982 --> 00:12:31,218
to myself throughout the
entirety of that period,

193
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:33,854
it sprung fully-formed from my psyche.

194
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:37,258
(tense violin music)

195
00:12:46,568 --> 00:12:49,803
(Mr. Usher snoring)

196
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:54,808
I endeavored to do the deed.

197
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:58,445
And so I did, that very same night.

198
00:12:59,547 --> 00:13:02,316
(door creaking)

199
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:07,988
(Mr. Usher breathing heavily)

200
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:19,900
(Mr. Usher breathing heavily)

201
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:49,129
(loud breathing)

202
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,879
(door creaking)

203
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:11,018
(tense music)

204
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:13,788
I prepared myself for
the finality of the task.

205
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:17,525
It was not my intention
to allow the old man

206
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,426
to pass all together peaceably.

207
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:21,663
A wrong is unredressed
when the avenger fails

208
00:14:21,763 --> 00:14:25,567
to make himself felt as such
to him who has done the wrong.

209
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:28,936
(tense violin music)

210
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:37,144
For more than an hour I waited,

211
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:40,347
listening the whole time
to that raspy breath.

212
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:41,482
(loud breathing)

213
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,984
That terrible inhalation
and exhalation stole my will

214
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:46,887
and replaced it with a
malice few have glimpsed

215
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:49,223
and fewer can comprehend.

216
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:55,929
(loud, raspy breathing)

217
00:14:57,866 --> 00:15:01,368
(distant clock ticking)

218
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:21,488
(suspenseful music)

219
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:35,402
And so I killed the old man.

220
00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:37,471
(dramatic music)

221
00:15:37,572 --> 00:15:40,040
(Mr. Usher choking)

222
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,443
The slightest pressure to the
throat allows the futility

223
00:15:42,544 --> 00:15:46,413
of hope to slip through with
each hideous passing breath,

224
00:15:46,514 --> 00:15:49,884
while the morphine seals
the inevitability of demise.

225
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:50,951
I held him at the edge of the abyss

226
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:54,622
for hours, days, or mere minutes.

227
00:15:54,722 --> 00:15:56,825
Time was a matter for other men.

228
00:15:56,925 --> 00:15:58,292
I could feel the torturous breath

229
00:15:58,392 --> 00:16:01,663
ebbing mercilessly from
him and taste the panic

230
00:16:01,763 --> 00:16:02,931
seeping from his pores.

231
00:16:03,798 --> 00:16:07,267
Decades of wasted thoughts
and fears, hopes and regrets

232
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,737
descended violently on the man's soul,

233
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:11,472
subduing his spirit.

234
00:16:11,573 --> 00:16:15,844
And in that moment, I
forgave him completely.

235
00:16:15,944 --> 00:16:17,779
My own spirit lifted
through the perverseness

236
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:19,179
of the endeavor.

237
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:27,421
Then all was silent

238
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,425
and I was alone.

239
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:35,195
(William cries)

240
00:16:42,937 --> 00:16:46,440
(rotary phone clicking)

241
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,578
(phone ringing)

242
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:51,579
- [Anna] Hello?

243
00:16:52,614 --> 00:16:53,515
- He's dead.

244
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,620
- [Anna] I'm so sorry.

245
00:16:59,854 --> 00:17:00,788
- Will you come?

246
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:04,626
Please?

247
00:17:04,726 --> 00:17:05,627
- Yes.

248
00:17:08,997 --> 00:17:12,567
(phone receiver rattles)

249
00:17:18,272 --> 00:17:21,776
(distant clock ticking)

250
00:17:34,956 --> 00:17:37,592
Have you contacted any of
the other family members?

251
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:38,593
- No.

252
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:41,328
- That's okay, take your time.

253
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:43,665
There's no rush with any of this.

254
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:48,302
- Will there be an
autopsy or an examination

255
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:50,672
to find out what happened?

256
00:17:50,772 --> 00:17:52,941
- We know what happened.

257
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,241
He was a very sick man.

258
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:55,175
I don't see a reason to do an aut--

259
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:56,744
- I mean, there's no way to know

260
00:17:56,844 --> 00:17:58,178
for sure what happened, right?

261
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:01,583
And no one else was here, and I, he was.

262
00:18:01,683 --> 00:18:04,619
He was banging on the
wall and it was so loud,

263
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:05,954
and I was angry.

264
00:18:06,054 --> 00:18:06,988
And he could...

265
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:08,288
He could barely breathe.
- William.

266
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:10,024
- And it was just so awful.
- William, William.

267
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:11,224
Look at me.

268
00:18:11,893 --> 00:18:14,428
This isn't your fault, okay?

269
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:16,998
You both knew this was going to happen.

270
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:22,503
He died peacefully at home, in
his bed, just like he wanted.

271
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:27,140
(William cries)

272
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,583
(somber music)

273
00:18:42,824 --> 00:18:45,459
(eerie music)

274
00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:41,949
(dramatic music)

275
00:19:46,087 --> 00:19:48,790
(somber music)

276
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,262
- Beneficiaries of the
estate will receive and share

277
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,230
all of the property
and assets not required

278
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,266
for the payment of any debts owed.

279
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,468
All property given under
this will is subject

280
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:04,672
to any encumbrances or liens
attached to the property.

281
00:20:04,772 --> 00:20:06,974
I direct my executor to
distribute the residue

282
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:08,475
of my estate as follows.

283
00:20:09,143 --> 00:20:12,647
(distant clock ticking)

284
00:20:27,862 --> 00:20:30,230
(music box banging)

285
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,568
(suspenseful music)

286
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:39,674
(distant clock ticking)

287
00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:45,412
(suspenseful music)

288
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:51,552
(clock ticking rapidly)

289
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:55,623
- What do you want me to say?

290
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,293
He made some mistakes.

291
00:21:04,198 --> 00:21:05,566
He was a piece of shit.

292
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,568
- Don't say that.

293
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,437
- He gave you nothing.

294
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:12,372
You wiped his ass.

295
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,242
You gave him food.

296
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:16,644
He gave you nothing.

297
00:21:16,744 --> 00:21:17,912
- He...

298
00:21:18,012 --> 00:21:19,446
He had his reasons.

299
00:21:21,249 --> 00:21:23,684
- Yeah, he did.

300
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:27,088
But he could have shown
one little shred of--

301
00:21:27,188 --> 00:21:28,288
- Pity?

302
00:21:30,258 --> 00:21:31,826
- Mercy.

303
00:21:31,926 --> 00:21:33,561
Fucking pride.

304
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:38,800
You're a lot like him.

305
00:21:41,936 --> 00:21:43,403
Take it as a compliment.

306
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,509
Listen, as far as I'm
concerned, house is yours.

307
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:50,711
- I don't want this fucking house.

308
00:21:50,812 --> 00:21:52,180
- He wouldn't want you to be homeless.

309
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,681
- You think he'd care?

310
00:21:56,117 --> 00:21:58,351
- Just stay here as long as you want.

311
00:21:58,451 --> 00:21:59,720
I don't wanna see my little brother

312
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:01,589
get kicked out on the street.

313
00:22:04,058 --> 00:22:05,693
(door slams)

314
00:22:05,793 --> 00:22:08,428
(tense music)

315
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:15,169
(crickets chirping)

316
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:16,671
- I never fully expected the old man

317
00:22:16,771 --> 00:22:18,673
to acknowledge my devotion.

318
00:22:18,773 --> 00:22:21,275
He was able somehow to see
beneath my facade of concern

319
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:23,443
and illuminate the
insincerity of my emotion,

320
00:22:23,544 --> 00:22:26,514
even when I was myself
incapable of doing so.

321
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:28,583
The ever-present gaze of his consciousne

322
00:22:28,683 --> 00:22:31,519
stretched seemingly across eons and back

323
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:34,755
to the moment of my absolute
unapologetic betrayal.

324
00:22:34,856 --> 00:22:37,558
I can see now how such knowledge
in defiance of all laws

325
00:22:37,658 --> 00:22:40,460
of causation informed
his behavior towards me

326
00:22:40,561 --> 00:22:41,929
from the very moment of my birth.

327
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:46,567
Such postulation and only
that may explain his peculiar

328
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:48,269
disdain for my existence,

329
00:22:49,136 --> 00:22:54,242
An antipathy my myopic mind
could never quite grasp.

330
00:22:55,142 --> 00:22:58,279
Suffice it to say the old
man never laid a hand on me,

331
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,781
never abused me, barely scolded me.

332
00:23:00,882 --> 00:23:03,383
He'd expressed his
displeasure not with words,

333
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:05,753
which the old man rarely
spoke in my direction,

334
00:23:05,853 --> 00:23:07,989
but by emanating a palpable
air of frustration,

335
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:11,559
which actively impressed upon
me my general unwelcomeness,

336
00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:14,228
as well as my inability
to ever generate a modicum

337
00:23:14,328 --> 00:23:16,631
of joy in his, or perhaps anyone's, life

338
00:23:20,534 --> 00:23:22,469
I have carried this with me,

339
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:25,072
although I can understand its falseness

340
00:23:25,172 --> 00:23:26,974
upon recollection and analysis.

341
00:23:27,642 --> 00:23:29,543
The aura of this energy
has seeped into the marrow

342
00:23:29,644 --> 00:23:30,845
of my bones, where it will lead me

343
00:23:30,945 --> 00:23:33,681
towards his same lonely
and disinterested end.

344
00:23:36,183 --> 00:23:39,754
I would've borne the entirety
of this insult with grit

345
00:23:39,854 --> 00:23:41,689
and grace, excepting the
fact that he pointed it

346
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:45,593
not just at myself, but at another.

347
00:23:45,693 --> 00:23:47,962
Just that singular breathing entity

348
00:23:48,062 --> 00:23:51,065
to whom I owe the entirety
of my miserable existence.

349
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:54,869
(somber music)

350
00:23:58,072 --> 00:24:01,409
Hers was a disposition
of deepest melancholy,

351
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:03,511
the sadness of a thinking woman.

352
00:24:03,611 --> 00:24:05,780
Nothing could have infuriated
the old man more than

353
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,382
such a creature whose depth,
both intellect and emotion

354
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:13,154
he could scarcely understand,
even on his most affable days.

355
00:24:14,221 --> 00:24:16,924
His disdain for her queries,
which were often rightly

356
00:24:17,024 --> 00:24:20,361
pointed squarely at the idiocy
and futility of his scheming,

357
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,796
coupled with a callous demeanor

358
00:24:21,896 --> 00:24:23,698
with which he met her most earnest pleas

359
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:26,133
for patience and understanding drove me,

360
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:30,504
I swear it, toward my intense
and inevitable hatred.

361
00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:34,008
Drove him, I say, to his
very own demise by my hand,

362
00:24:34,775 --> 00:24:36,978
for it was his being, his core state

363
00:24:37,078 --> 00:24:40,748
of unrelenting coldness,
which ushered forward

364
00:24:40,848 --> 00:24:44,118
that hideous moment that
would forever consume my life.

365
00:24:45,086 --> 00:24:47,788
(somber music)

366
00:25:20,054 --> 00:25:22,823
(door creaking)

367
00:25:31,065 --> 00:25:33,834
(ominous music)

368
00:25:39,407 --> 00:25:41,175
I did not return to that house.

369
00:25:44,145 --> 00:25:46,147
Nor did I allow myself to see the old ma

370
00:25:46,247 --> 00:25:48,082
for a number of years.

371
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,787
But I confess, I took his money.

372
00:25:53,621 --> 00:25:55,222
I continued my studies at university

373
00:25:55,322 --> 00:25:59,226
and subsisted on the fruits of
his tedious business dealings

374
00:25:59,326 --> 00:26:02,329
while simultaneously and
openly mocking the content

375
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:05,833
of his character for engaging
in those very same endeavors.

376
00:26:06,934 --> 00:26:12,073
This hypocrisy became one of
my few and deepest regrets.

377
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:17,244
The vortex of thoughtless folly
into which I so recklessly

378
00:26:17,344 --> 00:26:20,614
plunged washed away all but
the froth of my past hours,

379
00:26:20,714 --> 00:26:23,050
engulfed at once every
solid or serious impression

380
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,520
and left memory only the various levitie

381
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:27,455
of a former existence.

382
00:26:27,556 --> 00:26:30,257
(somber music)

383
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,761
Two years passed.

384
00:26:33,861 --> 00:26:37,665
The wine flowed freely, and
there were not wanting other

385
00:26:37,765 --> 00:26:40,334
and perhaps more dangerous seductions.

386
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,307
(suspenseful music)

387
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:14,368
(eerie rattling)

388
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:21,275
(distant laughing)

389
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:24,211
(light clicking)

390
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,716
(eerie rattling)

391
00:27:31,218 --> 00:27:34,221
(suspenseful music)

392
00:27:36,857 --> 00:27:37,892
(eerie rattling)

393
00:27:37,992 --> 00:27:42,229
(man laughing melodramatically)

394
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:46,700
(eerie rattling)

395
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:51,071
(soft buzzing)

396
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:57,978
(clock ticking rapidly)

397
00:28:03,484 --> 00:28:06,921
(soft music box music)

398
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:21,302
(cheerful music box music)

399
00:28:44,758 --> 00:28:47,494
(door creaking)

400
00:28:52,701 --> 00:28:54,802
(cheerful music box music)

401
00:28:54,902 --> 00:28:56,571
(light switch clicking)

402
00:28:56,671 --> 00:28:59,907
(suspenseful music)

403
00:29:36,544 --> 00:29:40,047
(clock ticking rapidly)

404
00:29:44,385 --> 00:29:47,421
(suspenseful music)

405
00:29:51,091 --> 00:29:54,529
(door creaking softly)

406
00:29:58,332 --> 00:30:01,035
(door banging)

407
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:05,507
In the weeks following the
deed, I found little solace.

408
00:30:07,107 --> 00:30:09,877
My hideous act had served
only to palsy the joy of fury

409
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:12,012
and righteous indignation,
but an action I concluded

410
00:30:12,112 --> 00:30:15,249
would've allowed these same
phantoms to consume me entirely,

411
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:17,786
a paradox too utterly monstrous
for solution, I assure you.

412
00:30:17,885 --> 00:30:21,322
(phone ringing loudly)

413
00:30:26,728 --> 00:30:27,796
Hello?

414
00:30:27,895 --> 00:30:29,363
- [Anna] Hi, William.

415
00:30:31,298 --> 00:30:35,836
Can I see you?

416
00:30:35,936 --> 00:30:38,839
(bright music)

417
00:30:48,717 --> 00:30:52,086
(door chiming softly)

418
00:30:55,889 --> 00:30:56,990
William?

419
00:30:58,492 --> 00:30:59,393
- Hi.

420
00:31:00,294 --> 00:31:01,195
- How are you?

421
00:31:01,862 --> 00:31:04,231
- Good, you know, all thing's considered

422
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:08,168
- May I?

423
00:31:08,268 --> 00:31:09,169
- Please.

424
00:31:17,378 --> 00:31:18,513
- So I...

425
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:22,916
I wanted to meet so I
could apologize in person.

426
00:31:23,016 --> 00:31:27,154
I did a really bad job of handling thing

427
00:31:27,254 --> 00:31:29,957
and I understand if you hate me.

428
00:31:31,191 --> 00:31:32,426
- I don't hate you.

429
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,464
- I mean, I know I abandoned
you in a really terrible time,

430
00:31:37,565 --> 00:31:40,934
and I swear, that's not how
I wanted things to happen.

431
00:31:41,034 --> 00:31:45,439
It's just things between us, they were..

432
00:31:51,345 --> 00:31:54,214
I just thought it would be
best if I excluded myself

433
00:31:54,314 --> 00:31:56,917
from the equation for a little while.

434
00:31:57,017 --> 00:31:58,753
I mean, you already had enough going on,

435
00:31:58,853 --> 00:32:02,356
and I could tell that you were
conflicted and vulnerable.

436
00:32:02,456 --> 00:32:05,660
And I didn't want you to feel
like I was taking advantage.

437
00:32:09,196 --> 00:32:12,099
It was just really bad timing.

438
00:32:15,603 --> 00:32:17,004
Terrible timing.

439
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:20,307
- I don't understand.

440
00:32:20,974 --> 00:32:24,244
- I mean, I thought that we...

441
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:27,549
And then we kissed.

442
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:31,118
- You thought there was
something between us?

443
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,020
- Well, yeah.

444
00:32:35,456 --> 00:32:36,356
- Oh.

445
00:32:39,393 --> 00:32:40,427
- Wasn't there?

446
00:32:41,395 --> 00:32:43,230
- I thought you were seeing someone.

447
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:46,500
- Not that I know of.

448
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:53,608
Well, I just wanted to
meet so I could apologize.

449
00:32:55,042 --> 00:32:56,243
- Apology accepted.

450
00:33:00,314 --> 00:33:01,215
So

451
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:04,719
I can call you now?

452
00:33:06,688 --> 00:33:10,390
(Anna chuckles softly)

453
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:11,793
- Yes.

454
00:33:11,893 --> 00:33:13,327
Yes, you can call me now.

455
00:33:14,929 --> 00:33:16,129
- Never would I have dared

456
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:18,365
entertain the remotest
possibility of a resolution

457
00:33:18,465 --> 00:33:21,468
beyond the realm of macabre solitude.

458
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:23,805
By what miracle I escaped destruction,

459
00:33:23,905 --> 00:33:25,740
it is impossible to say.

460
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,008
At that moment, the truth,

461
00:33:28,108 --> 00:33:30,678
the tragedy of the drama was no more.

462
00:33:30,778 --> 00:33:35,148
In an instant and in every
instant thereafter for a time,

463
00:33:35,249 --> 00:33:37,351
my sublime downfall was secured.

464
00:33:37,451 --> 00:33:38,953
For I loved her with a love more fervent

465
00:33:39,052 --> 00:33:40,922
than I believed it possible to feel

466
00:33:41,054 --> 00:33:42,557
for any denizen of the Earth.

467
00:33:42,657 --> 00:33:46,126
But here is where my incessant
commentary must cease,

468
00:33:46,226 --> 00:33:49,898
for I have no words, alas,
to tell the loveliness

469
00:33:49,998 --> 00:33:51,533
of loving well.

470
00:33:52,332 --> 00:33:56,169
(somber orchestral music)

471
00:34:10,585 --> 00:34:11,753
But I digress.

472
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:14,288
Where were we?

473
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:18,292
(playful orchestral music)

474
00:34:21,796 --> 00:34:25,332
The illness had shaken the
old man to his foundation.

475
00:34:25,432 --> 00:34:27,835
He indulged as do we
all the primitive belief

476
00:34:27,936 --> 00:34:29,604
that one's demise must be forever a vagu

477
00:34:29,704 --> 00:34:31,539
and distant prospect,

478
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:34,341
a telegraphed end to a fully-lived life.

479
00:34:35,309 --> 00:34:38,111
But the avenues to death
are numerous and strange,

480
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:40,848
traversed at a dizzying
and invisible velocity.

481
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:43,851
And when he summon companionship
in his hour of need,

482
00:34:43,952 --> 00:34:47,454
the same companionship he
would deny even his own bride,

483
00:34:48,121 --> 00:34:49,657
I wanted nothing more than to abandon hi

484
00:34:49,757 --> 00:34:53,895
fully and without remorse, but
I felt the air grow redolent

485
00:34:53,995 --> 00:34:56,496
with death's unquenchable thirst.

486
00:34:56,598 --> 00:34:59,266
It's oppressive weight took
entire possession of my soul.

487
00:34:59,366 --> 00:35:02,169
So I chose without will or premeditation

488
00:35:02,804 --> 00:35:04,672
to conspire against it.

489
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:10,678
Yeah.

490
00:35:10,778 --> 00:35:11,679
Okay.

491
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,116
(soft music box music)

492
00:35:16,818 --> 00:35:19,787
(monitors beeping)

493
00:35:23,858 --> 00:35:25,627
- Are you ready, Mr. Usher?

494
00:35:26,928 --> 00:35:28,228
- Okay, Dad.

495
00:35:28,328 --> 00:35:29,429
See you soon.

496
00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:33,635
- I'm scared.

497
00:35:43,878 --> 00:35:44,812
- To the old man.

498
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:51,919
May he rest in an overpriced
box in the ground.

499
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,454
(glasses clinking)

500
00:35:54,555 --> 00:35:56,456
- Don't speak ill of the dead.

501
00:35:56,557 --> 00:35:57,125
- Why not?

502
00:35:57,224 --> 00:35:58,626
They speak ill of us.

503
00:35:58,726 --> 00:36:00,360
- You're drunk.
- And you love it.

504
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,863
I'm finally opening up.

505
00:36:01,963 --> 00:36:04,732
(Anne chuckles)

506
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,536
I'm not drunk, I'm pretending.

507
00:36:09,236 --> 00:36:11,606
The truth is I'm gonna miss the old man.

508
00:36:12,305 --> 00:36:14,709
I don't know why I'm gonna miss him.

509
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:16,110
- But you loved him.

510
00:36:16,209 --> 00:36:18,146
I know you did.

511
00:36:18,245 --> 00:36:19,312
I could tell.

512
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,416
- You wanna see my father terrified?

513
00:36:22,517 --> 00:36:25,586
Tell him you love him.

514
00:36:25,687 --> 00:36:28,388
Jesus fucking Christ, I
can't even listen to myself.

515
00:36:28,488 --> 00:36:29,757
You wanna know the most profound thing

516
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:31,893
that he ever said to me?

517
00:36:31,993 --> 00:36:33,528
I was about six or seven.

518
00:36:33,628 --> 00:36:36,564
He said, "I see so much of myself in you

519
00:36:36,664 --> 00:36:40,101
"that sometimes I can't
even bear to look at you."

520
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,303
And it made me feel so fucking good,

521
00:36:43,403 --> 00:36:44,939
proud that I was like him

522
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:46,107
and proud that he couldn't stand me,

523
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:47,675
all at the same same time.

524
00:36:51,813 --> 00:36:54,549
Look, this is all just
grief, confusionable shit.

525
00:36:54,649 --> 00:36:57,417
So I would appreciate it if
you just forgot said anything.

526
00:36:57,518 --> 00:37:00,922
I don't think it's very fair
to hold this against me.

527
00:37:02,355 --> 00:37:03,858
But, secretly, I hope
it endears you to me.

528
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:05,392
Like, you know, I'm trying
to use the death of my father

529
00:37:05,492 --> 00:37:06,828
to get in your pants,

530
00:37:06,928 --> 00:37:08,996
which is the exact same kind
of thing that he would do.

531
00:37:09,097 --> 00:37:10,363
So maybe he was right all along.

532
00:37:10,464 --> 00:37:12,232
Except now I'm the one who
can't bear to look myself

533
00:37:12,332 --> 00:37:13,868
in the face, and halfway
through the speech,

534
00:37:13,968 --> 00:37:15,636
I lost track whether I was
trying to open up to you

535
00:37:15,737 --> 00:37:18,206
or manipulate you to try
to win your affection.

536
00:37:18,305 --> 00:37:21,374
I am either the most
self-aware mother fucker

537
00:37:21,475 --> 00:37:22,677
in the world or the least.

538
00:37:22,777 --> 00:37:25,378
And sometimes it feels
like there's no difference.

539
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,749
You know that one thing I said,

540
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:32,352
about how my father said I was like him,

541
00:37:33,521 --> 00:37:35,823
I don't even know if he actually said it

542
00:37:36,624 --> 00:37:40,494
or if I just saw it on some TV
show and imagined he said it,

543
00:37:41,328 --> 00:37:42,997
but I thought it would win
me some fucking points.

544
00:37:43,097 --> 00:37:44,364
So voila, it's part of my story now.

545
00:37:44,464 --> 00:37:47,602
And I have no fucking clue
how real any any of it is.

546
00:37:52,673 --> 00:37:54,709
- You think you killed your father.

547
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:58,179
(suspenseful music)

548
00:37:58,278 --> 00:37:59,379
- No.

549
00:38:00,848 --> 00:38:01,883
- [Anna] You didn't.

550
00:38:02,817 --> 00:38:03,718
- I know.

551
00:38:06,154 --> 00:38:09,090
(suspenseful music)

552
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,858
A lie which follows a wild truth

553
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:13,961
obscures itself entirely
and without effort.

554
00:38:16,564 --> 00:38:18,498
I would've told her, but
there are some secrets

555
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,868
that do not let themselves be told.

556
00:38:21,669 --> 00:38:23,470
Men die nightly in their beds,

557
00:38:23,571 --> 00:38:25,472
ringing the hands of ghostly confessors

558
00:38:25,573 --> 00:38:28,375
and looking them piteously in the eyes.

559
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:31,712
Die with despair of heart
and convulsion of throat

560
00:38:31,813 --> 00:38:34,816
on account of the hideous mysteries,

561
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:37,885
which will not suffer
themselves to be revealed.

562
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:43,558
(loud banging)

563
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,102
(water splashing)

564
00:38:57,437 --> 00:38:59,372
(door creaking)

565
00:38:59,472 --> 00:39:02,977
(light switch clicking)

566
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:11,152
(light switch clicking)
(dramatic music)

567
00:39:11,252 --> 00:39:14,155
(William gasping)

568
00:39:14,255 --> 00:39:15,323
- William?

569
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:19,359
William, William, it's okay.

570
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:20,862
You're awake, it's okay.

571
00:39:22,964 --> 00:39:23,865
It's okay.

572
00:39:25,266 --> 00:39:26,634
It was only a dream.

573
00:39:29,136 --> 00:39:30,972
- [William] Only a dream.

574
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,973
And if not?

575
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,109
Ah, what world of mystery and meaning,

576
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:37,011
doubt and uncertainty is there involved

577
00:39:37,111 --> 00:39:39,213
in those two letters?

578
00:39:39,313 --> 00:39:40,882
That mono-syllable.

579
00:39:41,782 --> 00:39:42,683
If.

580
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:46,954
(light switch clicking)

581
00:39:49,056 --> 00:39:51,826
(door creaking)

582
00:40:01,501 --> 00:40:02,770
- [Doctor] Mr. Usher.

583
00:40:11,812 --> 00:40:14,115
- Successful surgery brought
a bare modicum of hope

584
00:40:14,215 --> 00:40:17,585
immediately quashed by the
test results that followed.

585
00:40:17,685 --> 00:40:20,321
No sooner had the old man
heard of his impending doom

586
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,324
than he adjusted his focus as always

587
00:40:23,423 --> 00:40:25,458
solely toward the business at hand.

588
00:40:26,861 --> 00:40:28,963
He immediately sold all earthly property

589
00:40:29,063 --> 00:40:33,401
most notably the home of my
miserably-contented childhood,

590
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,603
and consolidated his
moderate wealth to a fund

591
00:40:35,703 --> 00:40:37,638
whose singular purpose
became providing death

592
00:40:37,738 --> 00:40:40,107
in the most socially-accepted fashion.

593
00:40:41,042 --> 00:40:43,577
Modest furniture and all
manner of medical necessity

594
00:40:43,678 --> 00:40:44,879
was delivered directly to a home

595
00:40:44,979 --> 00:40:47,515
particularly suited to
the macabre occasion.

596
00:40:48,182 --> 00:40:50,518
The old man resigned,
whether as repentance

597
00:40:50,618 --> 00:40:54,622
or misanthropic protestation to die alon

598
00:40:56,424 --> 00:40:59,527
He desired this, he assured me,

599
00:40:59,627 --> 00:41:01,896
as his one and only dying wish.

600
00:41:07,234 --> 00:41:09,937
No more than two brief
days after relocation,

601
00:41:10,037 --> 00:41:11,305
he was taken ill,

602
00:41:11,405 --> 00:41:14,575
and seeing him feeble and
frightened and pitying himself

603
00:41:14,675 --> 00:41:16,143
in that absurd pauper's bed,

604
00:41:16,243 --> 00:41:19,146
surrounded by nurses who
flattered and fawned about,

605
00:41:20,581 --> 00:41:22,817
I determined to deny his request.

606
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:25,753
(loud breathing)

607
00:41:35,029 --> 00:41:35,930
I'll stay.

608
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:39,667
(loud breathing)

609
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:55,816
(muffled chattering)

610
00:41:57,284 --> 00:41:58,052
- [Anna] William!

611
00:41:58,152 --> 00:41:59,353
- I'm, I'm sorry.

612
00:41:59,453 --> 00:42:00,688
What were you saying?

613
00:42:00,788 --> 00:42:02,723
- That I'm worried about you.

614
00:42:04,592 --> 00:42:05,926
- I can't imagine why.

615
00:42:07,628 --> 00:42:08,729
- What can I do?

616
00:42:10,398 --> 00:42:11,532
- You're doing it.

617
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,834
- Good.

618
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:15,504
Because I have to use
the little girls' room,

619
00:42:15,603 --> 00:42:18,773
and I can't hold it any longer. (laughs)

620
00:42:24,445 --> 00:42:27,214
(door creaking)

621
00:42:29,116 --> 00:42:31,819
(gentle music)

622
00:42:32,686 --> 00:42:35,656
(door creaking)

623
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:40,094
(light switch clicking)

624
00:42:43,297 --> 00:42:46,067
(William sighs)

625
00:43:04,218 --> 00:43:05,119
(dramatic music)

626
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:08,122
(William gasping)

627
00:43:10,391 --> 00:43:11,258
William!

628
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:14,195
William, William, what's going on?

629
00:43:16,964 --> 00:43:17,566
Hey.

630
00:43:17,665 --> 00:43:18,766
Are you okay?

631
00:43:20,668 --> 00:43:21,769
Yeah?

632
00:43:22,504 --> 00:43:23,604
Okay.

633
00:43:26,207 --> 00:43:29,610
- It was, I told her, a
momentary lapse of faculties.

634
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:32,313
The weight of that room,
the influence of wine,

635
00:43:32,413 --> 00:43:34,516
the physical toll of my grief.

636
00:43:34,615 --> 00:43:36,150
I would be fine.

637
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,586
I required sleep.

638
00:43:37,685 --> 00:43:40,855
I needed, I told her, to
be alone with my thoughts.

639
00:43:43,257 --> 00:43:45,893
(tense music)

640
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:52,066
(door creaking)

641
00:43:56,137 --> 00:43:58,906
(clock ticking)

642
00:44:00,441 --> 00:44:01,709
(sponge brushing)

643
00:44:01,809 --> 00:44:04,011
Distraction and distraction alone can ke

644
00:44:04,111 --> 00:44:08,315
at bay the senseless manifestations
of nerves and anxiety.

645
00:44:08,415 --> 00:44:11,385
And so I threw myself fully
towards such distraction,

646
00:44:11,485 --> 00:44:14,488
but my mind never strayed
far from that accursed room.

647
00:44:14,589 --> 00:44:15,590
(door creaking)

648
00:44:15,723 --> 00:44:16,558
The desperate pounding.

649
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:17,858
(loud banging)

650
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:18,826
His hideous breath.

651
00:44:18,926 --> 00:44:19,994
(heavy breathing)

652
00:44:20,094 --> 00:44:22,564
The last waltz of fawn weather.

653
00:44:22,663 --> 00:44:25,366
(loud banging)

654
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,969
- How's my favorite fuck
up little brother today?

655
00:44:30,804 --> 00:44:33,107
How's work, social life?

656
00:44:33,207 --> 00:44:35,442
Met anyone special since we last talked?

657
00:44:36,443 --> 00:44:37,978
- What do you want?

658
00:44:38,078 --> 00:44:41,348
- Why are you always so hostile?

659
00:44:42,283 --> 00:44:43,117
We're brothers.

660
00:44:43,217 --> 00:44:44,885
Is it really so hard to believe that I

661
00:44:44,985 --> 00:44:48,055
actually love and care about you?

662
00:44:49,658 --> 00:44:51,225
Come on, sit down.

663
00:44:56,197 --> 00:44:58,966
I think we should get
better at this, don't you?

664
00:45:02,504 --> 00:45:06,106
So I've been thinking, we've
never really been close.

665
00:45:06,207 --> 00:45:09,443
I feel like I come from a whole
other world than you really.

666
00:45:09,544 --> 00:45:10,744
And to be honest,

667
00:45:10,844 --> 00:45:13,480
it was never easy growing
up as Dad's favorite.

668
00:45:13,582 --> 00:45:16,383
All the expectations and comparisons.

669
00:45:17,051 --> 00:45:19,654
I could never be the
out there, fuck society,

670
00:45:19,753 --> 00:45:21,523
punk rock rebel.

671
00:45:21,623 --> 00:45:25,059
I had to do all of my
counter-cultural growing up in secret.

672
00:45:25,826 --> 00:45:28,530
Honestly, I kinda hated you for it,

673
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:31,065
but I figure, let bygones be bygones.

674
00:45:31,165 --> 00:45:33,100
Dad's six feet under, God rest him.

675
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,068
Probably not.

676
00:45:34,168 --> 00:45:37,004
All we have left is each other, right?

677
00:45:38,839 --> 00:45:41,509
So how about this?

678
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:43,744
Instead of going on some cheesy retreat

679
00:45:43,844 --> 00:45:47,014
or talking about our feelings,

680
00:45:47,114 --> 00:45:49,016
let's just fuck the same girl,

681
00:45:49,116 --> 00:45:52,286
preferably at the same time,
and then compare notes.

682
00:45:53,387 --> 00:45:54,888
- Look.
- Sit down!

683
00:45:55,856 --> 00:45:57,958
(tense music)

684
00:45:58,058 --> 00:46:00,060
Seriously, sit the fuck back down.

685
00:46:04,098 --> 00:46:06,900
I don't know what the fuck
you think you're doing,

686
00:46:07,001 --> 00:46:09,303
playing up this whole
grief-stricken little boy thing

687
00:46:09,403 --> 00:46:12,773
to get some pussy, but it's fucking sick

688
00:46:12,873 --> 00:46:15,776
You are fucking sick.

689
00:46:17,144 --> 00:46:19,013
You don't even know who she is.

690
00:46:20,014 --> 00:46:21,750
She has her own story.

691
00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:23,484
She's not here to serve yours.

692
00:46:25,352 --> 00:46:30,291
I understand you wanna be me so badly,

693
00:46:30,391 --> 00:46:32,694
you can even fool yourself
into believing it's true,

694
00:46:32,793 --> 00:46:34,094
but it's not.

695
00:46:35,697 --> 00:46:38,499
This can't last.

696
00:46:39,933 --> 00:46:42,036
And whatever is going on between you two

697
00:46:42,136 --> 00:46:46,140
as some kind of fucked up
revenge thing, it'll pass.

698
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,043
And you'll end up alone,
holding your dick in your hands,

699
00:46:49,143 --> 00:46:52,212
whining about how unlovable you are.

700
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,448
Sound about right?

701
00:46:56,718 --> 00:46:58,185
So let's cut to the end.

702
00:46:59,086 --> 00:47:01,088
I want her out of your life.

703
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:04,491
You end this now.

704
00:47:05,694 --> 00:47:08,062
If you don't, I will.

705
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:12,166
It's your choice, brother.

706
00:47:14,401 --> 00:47:17,438
(suspenseful music)

707
00:47:18,972 --> 00:47:21,275
- His plain words presented
without the frills

708
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:25,479
and misdeeds of the poet
unmasked a naked truth,

709
00:47:26,815 --> 00:47:28,650
one which would disarm and drive me

710
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:33,320
perfectly and deeply into
the maelstrom of my own mind.

711
00:47:34,955 --> 00:47:38,727
This can't last.

712
00:47:38,827 --> 00:47:42,062
(suspenseful music)

713
00:47:51,872 --> 00:47:54,642
(ominous music)

714
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,915
That an earnest, mutual
love burned within us,

715
00:48:02,015 --> 00:48:03,283
I cannot deny.

716
00:48:04,753 --> 00:48:07,054
How vainly had we flattered ourselves,

717
00:48:07,154 --> 00:48:09,223
feeling happy in its first up-springing,

718
00:48:09,323 --> 00:48:12,393
that our happiness would
strengthen with its strength.

719
00:48:12,493 --> 00:48:16,296
As it grew, so grew in my heart
the dread of that evil hour,

720
00:48:16,397 --> 00:48:20,467
which was hurrying I now
knew to separate us forever.

721
00:48:22,837 --> 00:48:25,472
Every look, every gesture became an omen

722
00:48:25,573 --> 00:48:27,341
of inescapable doom.

723
00:48:28,075 --> 00:48:31,145
Thus in time it became painful to love.

724
00:48:31,245 --> 00:48:33,313
Hate would've been a mercy then.

725
00:48:35,048 --> 00:48:36,718
Each blissful moment we were together,

726
00:48:36,818 --> 00:48:39,521
I longed for wretched solitude.

727
00:48:41,155 --> 00:48:44,158
And so I gently curbed our association,

728
00:48:44,258 --> 00:48:46,761
desperate to postpone with
absence the inevitable

729
00:48:46,861 --> 00:48:49,029
and fatal estrangement.

730
00:48:51,265 --> 00:48:53,267
It's here the threads of
the narrative tapestry

731
00:48:53,367 --> 00:48:56,538
of my recollections
begin to fray and unwind.

732
00:48:56,638 --> 00:48:59,173
Whether this can be blamed
on the self-inflating nature

733
00:48:59,273 --> 00:49:02,911
of memory or the
reality-bending will of ego,

734
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:04,278
I cannot say,

735
00:49:05,479 --> 00:49:08,783
but the systems by which
I lived my entire life

736
00:49:08,883 --> 00:49:10,518
revealed themselves as farce.

737
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:16,858
It seemed now that motive followed actio

738
00:49:17,124 --> 00:49:19,661
just as cause precedes effect.

739
00:49:21,896 --> 00:49:25,332
(clock ticking loudly)

740
00:49:34,809 --> 00:49:38,245
(soft music box music)

741
00:49:54,061 --> 00:49:57,030
(door creaking)

742
00:50:00,367 --> 00:50:04,271
(cheerful music box music)

743
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:10,043
(floor creaking softly)

744
00:50:33,701 --> 00:50:36,604
(bureau creaking)

745
00:50:38,272 --> 00:50:41,509
(suspenseful music)

746
00:50:54,388 --> 00:50:58,258
(cheerful music box music)

747
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:07,367
(dramatic crescendo)

748
00:51:18,278 --> 00:51:21,816
(basement door creaking)

749
00:51:25,185 --> 00:51:28,288
(ladder clanking)

750
00:51:30,959 --> 00:51:33,728
(boot thumping)

751
00:51:34,896 --> 00:51:38,198
(footsteps thudding)

752
00:51:49,611 --> 00:51:52,446
(water dripping)

753
00:51:53,815 --> 00:51:56,884
(footsteps thudding)

754
00:52:02,189 --> 00:52:05,225
(light clicking)

755
00:52:06,293 --> 00:52:09,129
(ax scraping)

756
00:52:16,269 --> 00:52:20,173
(cheerful music box music)

757
00:52:49,269 --> 00:52:52,305
(dramatic music)

758
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:56,911
(body thuds)

759
00:52:59,312 --> 00:53:01,314
(thrilling music)

760
00:53:01,415 --> 00:53:04,519
(William panting)

761
00:53:05,185 --> 00:53:08,288
(thrilling music)

762
00:53:17,131 --> 00:53:20,635
(distant clock ticking)

763
00:53:31,846 --> 00:53:34,214
(light switch clicking)

764
00:53:34,314 --> 00:53:37,284
(door creaking)

765
00:53:40,722 --> 00:53:43,290
(head banging)

766
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:46,259
(loud banging)

767
00:53:46,894 --> 00:53:49,664
(door creaking)

768
00:53:52,567 --> 00:53:56,269
(light switch clicking)

769
00:54:03,044 --> 00:54:08,281
(loud banging)
(music box music)

770
00:54:11,185 --> 00:54:13,955
(drill buzzing)

771
00:54:18,425 --> 00:54:20,360
(lock clicking)

772
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:23,798
(footsteps pattering)

773
00:54:24,866 --> 00:54:26,834
In the weeks following,
I endured three separate

774
00:54:26,934 --> 00:54:31,105
but equally recurring
visions, often in tandem

775
00:54:31,205 --> 00:54:33,306
and always at the edge of waking thought

776
00:54:34,008 --> 00:54:36,844
They deprived all rest
and withered my mind.

777
00:54:36,944 --> 00:54:39,346
I hold them without doubt
directly responsible

778
00:54:39,446 --> 00:54:41,414
for the depraved events which followed.

779
00:54:41,516 --> 00:54:46,286
And I present them undefiled, thus.

780
00:54:47,054 --> 00:54:52,292
(somber music)
(loud banging)

781
00:54:56,496 --> 00:55:01,702
(loud banging)
(water splashing)

782
00:55:04,505 --> 00:55:07,407
(loud banging)

783
00:55:09,442 --> 00:55:11,879
(door creaking)

784
00:55:11,979 --> 00:55:14,882
(Mother coughing)

785
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:24,859
(somber music)
(loud banging)

786
00:55:37,437 --> 00:55:40,473
(Mother choking)

787
00:55:48,448 --> 00:55:50,952
(Mother choking)

788
00:55:51,052 --> 00:55:51,986
(eerie rattling)

789
00:55:52,086 --> 00:55:53,486
- Don't kill her again.

790
00:55:53,588 --> 00:55:55,289
(William gasping)

791
00:55:55,388 --> 00:55:58,491
(William panting)

792
00:56:01,394 --> 00:56:04,364
(William sighs)

793
00:56:06,567 --> 00:56:10,004
(soft music box music)

794
00:56:16,677 --> 00:56:20,581
(cheerful music box music)

795
00:56:29,223 --> 00:56:32,727
(distant clock ticking)

796
00:56:37,397 --> 00:56:41,102
(cheerful music box music)

797
00:56:59,987 --> 00:57:03,090
(dramatic crescendo)

798
00:57:07,762 --> 00:57:11,464
(distant clock ticking)

799
00:57:15,036 --> 00:57:16,370
(loud banging)

800
00:57:16,469 --> 00:57:19,573
(thrilling music)

801
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:23,144
(loud banging)

802
00:57:30,618 --> 00:57:33,521
(loud banging)

803
00:57:41,662 --> 00:57:44,565
(loud banging)

804

(loud banging)

805
00:58:00,581 --> 00:58:03,483
(loud banging)

806
00:58:12,259 --> 00:58:14,962
(loud banging)

807
00:58:21,936 --> 00:58:24,705
(jarring music)

808
00:58:30,177 --> 00:58:32,813
(lock clicks)

809
00:58:43,791 --> 00:58:47,028
(suspenseful music)

810
00:58:53,734 --> 00:58:57,204
(mysterious whispering)

811
00:59:17,425 --> 00:59:20,661
(suspenseful music)

812
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:25,699
(thrilling music)

813
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:31,038
(dramatic music)
(mysterious buzzing)

814
00:59:34,809 --> 00:59:38,712
(thrilling, jarring music)

815
00:59:58,699 --> 01:00:02,269
(dramatic, shrill music)

816
01:00:03,404 --> 01:00:06,373
(water dripping)

817
01:00:06,474 --> 01:00:09,777
(handcuffs jangling)

818
01:00:20,555 --> 01:00:24,325
(William whimpering softly)

819
01:00:25,326 --> 01:00:28,629
(handcuffs jangling)

820
01:00:31,398 --> 01:00:33,434
(William screams)

821
01:00:33,535 --> 01:00:36,303
(William cries)

822
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:42,209
(thrilling, jarring music)

823
01:00:45,346 --> 01:00:49,116
(William breathing heavily)

824
01:00:50,284 --> 01:00:53,787
(clock ticking rapidly)

825
01:00:59,528 --> 01:01:02,763
(suspenseful music)

826
01:01:27,888 --> 01:01:30,991
(water splashing)

827
01:01:34,461 --> 01:01:37,464

829
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,223
(light switch clicking)

830
01:02:02,323 --> 01:02:05,092
(phone ringing)

831
01:02:14,735 --> 01:02:15,836
Hello?

832
01:02:16,605 --> 01:02:17,871
- [Anna] Hi, William.

833
01:02:19,541 --> 01:02:20,941
Can I see you?

834
01:02:24,411 --> 01:02:29,850
- Alas, we have fallen on
our most evil of evil days.

835
01:02:36,524 --> 01:02:39,293
(glass sliding)

836
01:02:50,838 --> 01:02:52,039
- How are you?

837
01:02:53,941 --> 01:02:55,042
- I'm fine.

838
01:02:58,647 --> 01:03:00,314
- William, what's going on?

839
01:03:04,118 --> 01:03:06,153
You're really not gonna talk to me?

840
01:03:09,624 --> 01:03:10,958
William, we have to talk.

841
01:03:11,058 --> 01:03:13,394
I've seen you, what?

842
01:03:13,494 --> 01:03:16,430
Once in the past three weeks?

843
01:03:17,865 --> 01:03:20,100
I know you're going through some stuff,

844
01:03:21,135 --> 01:03:26,006
but it's time to move on.

845
01:03:27,676 --> 01:03:30,311
(tense music)

846
01:03:32,179 --> 01:03:33,180
I'm sorry.

847
01:03:34,982 --> 01:03:38,152
I just can't be with you.

848
01:03:45,292 --> 01:03:46,795
Do you hear what I'm saying?

849
01:03:46,894 --> 01:03:48,596
I can't live like this.

850
01:03:55,704 --> 01:03:58,372
I just don't know what else to do.

851
01:04:10,951 --> 01:04:13,987
(dramatic music)

852
01:04:14,656 --> 01:04:16,457
(mysterious whispering)

853
01:04:16,558 --> 01:04:19,393
(eerie creaking)

854
01:04:30,505 --> 01:04:35,744
I think it's best for both of
us if I never see you again.

855
01:04:36,043 --> 01:04:39,146
(thrilling music)

856
01:04:41,014 --> 01:04:43,585
William, it's time to let go.

857
01:04:45,787 --> 01:04:48,922
(hammer squelches)

858
01:04:49,022 --> 01:04:50,457
(Anna gasping softly)

859
01:04:50,558 --> 01:04:53,127
(body thuds)

860
01:04:56,363 --> 01:04:59,066
(somber music)

861
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:08,208
- I did not want her dead.

862
01:05:08,308 --> 01:05:11,646
That in the end is why she died.

863
01:05:21,155 --> 01:05:26,226
I reached out and touched her warm cheek

864
01:05:27,194 --> 01:05:28,962
her bloodied hair.

865
01:05:30,431 --> 01:05:31,999
And I pressed down her pallid eyelids

866
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:34,268
with passionate fingers of love.

867
01:05:37,806 --> 01:05:40,307
What knowledge I found in that moment.

868
01:05:40,407 --> 01:05:42,376
What accurate regret and longing.

869
01:05:44,311 --> 01:05:49,517
What truth, beautiful and
saccharine and fleeting.

870
01:05:56,591 --> 01:05:57,926
(tense music)

871
01:05:58,058 --> 01:06:01,729
(cheerful music box music)

872
01:06:17,745 --> 01:06:21,281
(basement door creaking)

873
01:06:26,487 --> 01:06:29,256
(body dragging)

874
01:06:33,193 --> 01:06:36,497
(footsteps thudding)

875
01:06:40,802 --> 01:06:43,505
(somber music)

876
01:06:47,007 --> 01:06:50,010
(sheet rustling)

877
01:06:58,887 --> 01:07:02,055
(sponge scrubbing)

878
01:07:04,324 --> 01:07:08,028
(toothbrush scratching)

879
01:07:09,229 --> 01:07:12,266
(mouth spitting)

880
01:07:13,635 --> 01:07:15,970
(dramatic crescendo)

881
01:07:16,069 --> 01:07:19,306
(crickets chirping)

882
01:07:21,743 --> 01:07:25,445
(William breathing deeply)

883
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:30,217
(water dripping)

884
01:07:31,953 --> 01:07:35,523
(basement door creaking)

885
01:08:22,570 --> 01:08:25,339
I knew then that I'd
never really loved her.

886
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:27,441
In the strange anomaly of my existence,

887
01:08:27,542 --> 01:08:31,445
feelings with me had
never been of the heart.

888
01:08:31,546 --> 01:08:34,481
And my passions always were of the mind.

889
01:08:34,582 --> 01:08:35,984
(bell tolling)

890
01:08:36,084 --> 01:08:38,218
A mind whose ringing
obsession grew amplified

891
01:08:38,318 --> 01:08:41,355
by the harsh daylight of waking hours,

892
01:08:41,455 --> 01:08:44,092
which illuminates with
indifference the severity of deeds

893
01:08:44,191 --> 01:08:45,927
and the inescapable conclusion

894
01:08:46,027 --> 01:08:47,762
that must invariably be drawn.

895
01:08:49,731 --> 01:08:50,932
All is madness.

896
01:08:51,032 --> 01:08:54,535
(clock ticking rapidly)

897
01:08:57,337 --> 01:09:00,340
But day must submit to the
cool irrationality of night.

898
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:03,845
As my tumultuous mind must
submit to the softness of earth.

899
01:09:05,345 --> 01:09:07,649
And the embrace of my Anna.

900
01:09:07,749 --> 01:09:11,318
(thrilling violin music)

901
01:09:13,153 --> 01:09:16,490
Then by daylight return
of the blinding pall

902
01:09:16,591 --> 01:09:21,129
of self-examination, self-pity,
and the sickness of regret.

903
01:09:21,228 --> 01:09:23,230
(clock ticking rapidly)

904
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:26,366
And of the desire to simply not be.

905
01:09:26,466 --> 01:09:30,237
(thrilling violin music)

906
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:33,574
It was macabre routine.
(William whimpers)

907
01:09:33,675 --> 01:09:37,078
A pestilential cycle
of doubt and assurance,

908
01:09:37,177 --> 01:09:40,280
hatred and love, perdition and paradise.

909
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:43,250
(William whimpers)

910
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:44,484
(lock clicks)

911
01:09:44,585 --> 01:09:49,824
(William whimpering)
(lock clicking)

912
01:09:50,357 --> 01:09:51,793
I became insane.

913
01:09:52,727 --> 01:09:55,663
With long intervals of horrible sanity.

914
01:09:56,798 --> 01:09:59,567
(ominous music)

915
01:10:07,608 --> 01:10:10,343
The specters that had elicited
in me feelings more intense

916
01:10:10,444 --> 01:10:12,747
than terror for which there
is no name upon the earth

917
01:10:12,847 --> 01:10:17,585
became a constant, and I,
in shroud of false apathy,

918
01:10:17,685 --> 01:10:21,288
became the haunting force
of endless empty rooms.

919
01:10:21,388 --> 01:10:24,125
They belonged now only to the dead.

920
01:10:24,224 --> 01:10:26,994
(eerie wailing)

921
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:32,600
All around were horror and thick gloom,

922
01:10:33,333 --> 01:10:35,770
and a black sweltering desert of ebony.

923
01:10:37,872 --> 01:10:38,940
(basement door creaking)

924
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,042
Her sepulcher, our tomb,

925
01:10:41,142 --> 01:10:42,409
became a place to set off the mind

926
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:45,479
and liberate it from the
weight of the waking world.

927
01:10:47,148 --> 01:10:49,083
It is happiness to wonder.

928
01:10:49,183 --> 01:10:50,952
It is happiness to dream.

929
01:10:51,853 --> 01:10:54,488
Such a dream became the
business of my life.

930
01:10:56,591 --> 01:10:58,760
I existed solely to wade
into placid memories

931
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:01,294
of our unending partnership
full and complete,

932
01:11:01,394 --> 01:11:03,931
and without the hindrances
of social expectation,

933
01:11:04,031 --> 01:11:07,135
impending loss or reality.

934
01:11:07,235 --> 01:11:10,470
(suspenseful music)

935
01:11:16,744 --> 01:11:20,014
Anna and I loved with a love
that was more than love.

936
01:11:20,114 --> 01:11:25,285
A love of which my waking self
was most assuredly incapable.

937
01:11:25,385 --> 01:11:27,054
(mysterious whispering)

938
01:11:27,155 --> 01:11:29,857
We shared the life that should have been

939
01:11:32,927 --> 01:11:35,530
Until the sun in the East
and the doubt in my mind

940
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:38,431
rose up and whispered in a cruel wrath,

941
01:11:41,169 --> 01:11:44,005
"All you love, you love alone."

942
01:11:47,008 --> 01:11:49,811
(loud banging)

943
01:11:49,911 --> 01:11:51,045
- Where is she?

944
01:11:51,145 --> 01:11:52,046
- [William] I don't understand.

945
01:11:52,146 --> 01:11:53,346
- Don't fucking play games with me.

946
01:11:53,446 --> 01:11:54,849
Where the hell is Anna?

947
01:11:56,050 --> 01:11:57,251
I know you know, you little shit,

948
01:11:57,350 --> 01:11:58,786
so tell me where she is.

949
01:11:59,486 --> 01:12:01,022
- She doesn't wanna see you.

950
01:12:02,056 --> 01:12:02,924
- She's here?

951
01:12:07,327 --> 01:12:10,832
(clock ticking rapidly)

952
01:12:13,534 --> 01:12:16,369
(tense music)

953
01:12:32,385 --> 01:12:33,486
Anna?

954
01:12:37,158 --> 01:12:38,292
Anna, are you in here?

955
01:12:38,391 --> 01:12:41,062
- She hasn't been acting
like herself, okay?

956
01:12:43,363 --> 01:12:44,464
- [Wilson] How do you mean?

957
01:12:44,565 --> 01:12:48,435
- She's been hearing
things, seeing things.

958
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:50,638
Paranoia, I just...

959
01:12:52,073 --> 01:12:54,909
Just wondered if you wanted
to help her, you know?

960
01:13:00,615 --> 01:13:02,750
- So where is she?

961
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:05,052
- She really doesn't wanna talk to you.

962
01:13:07,221 --> 01:13:10,124
Let me talk with her, alone.

963
01:13:14,762 --> 01:13:17,131
Look, I'm in over my head.

964
01:13:17,231 --> 01:13:18,733
I know that I'm in over my head,

965
01:13:18,833 --> 01:13:20,201
but just let me talk to her.

966
01:13:20,301 --> 01:13:21,769
Let me convince her.

967
01:13:23,971 --> 01:13:24,639
Come back tonight at 10.

968
01:13:24,739 --> 01:13:26,607
I'll make sure she's here.

969
01:13:28,376 --> 01:13:30,544
Let me do this, okay?

970
01:13:34,315 --> 01:13:37,551
(suspenseful music)

971
01:13:45,259 --> 01:13:47,361
(water dripping)

972
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:50,031
I would not let him have her.

973
01:13:52,934 --> 01:13:55,636
(lips smacking)

974
01:13:55,736 --> 01:13:58,973
(suspenseful music)

975
01:14:02,543 --> 01:14:05,579
(sheet rustling)

976
01:14:14,555 --> 01:14:17,457
(vibrant violin music)
(drill buzzing)

977
01:14:17,558 --> 01:14:20,328
The usefulness of indignation
is a curious thing.

978
01:14:20,428 --> 01:14:23,030
A single dismissive act can
turn the most self-loathing

979
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:26,434
towards righteousness, and
replace the most fervent malaise

980
01:14:26,534 --> 01:14:29,136
with absolute motivation.

981
01:14:29,236 --> 01:14:31,105
I despised and pitied myself, true,

982
01:14:31,205 --> 01:14:34,442
but he too despised and pitied me.

983
01:14:34,542 --> 01:14:36,410
And for that, I would be avenged.

984
01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:37,778
I turned once again to those tenets

985
01:14:37,878 --> 01:14:40,281
that had driven me to this madness.

986
01:14:40,381 --> 01:14:44,018
System, logic, method.

987
01:14:44,118 --> 01:14:46,854
Yes, method is the thing.

988
01:14:46,954 --> 01:14:48,756
There is a brilliance in method,

989
01:14:48,856 --> 01:14:52,059
in routine and reliability,
that borders on genius.

990
01:14:53,027 --> 01:14:54,095
And yet, it is not.

991
01:14:54,996 --> 01:14:56,998
Genius is always going off at some tange

992
01:14:57,098 --> 01:14:59,300
of ridiculous speculation,
but I found it necessary

993
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:03,437
to keep my eyes downcast and
focus on the business at hand.

994
01:15:04,271 --> 01:15:08,342
It was my intention now to
put my scheme into operation.

995
01:15:09,176 --> 01:15:11,579
And I resolved to make
him feel the whole extent

996
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:14,715
of the malice with which I was imbued.

997
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:18,219
(vibrant violin music)

998
01:15:21,088 --> 01:15:23,891
I knew then that I was
not long for this world,

999
01:15:24,692 --> 01:15:27,361
but also that the modicum
of time left to me

1000
01:15:27,461 --> 01:15:29,764
would be overflowing with that panacea,

1001
01:15:29,864 --> 01:15:32,967
which invigorates even the
most wretched of souls.

1002
01:15:33,067 --> 01:15:33,868
Purpose.

1003
01:15:33,968 --> 01:15:36,604
(hand banging)

1004
01:15:36,704 --> 01:15:39,373
Come in, dear brother.

1005
01:15:39,473 --> 01:15:40,775
Can I get your drink?

1006
01:15:40,875 --> 01:15:43,512
I have a very fine bottle
of dry sherry open.

1007
01:15:43,611 --> 01:15:44,979
- Where is she?

1008
01:15:45,079 --> 01:15:47,214
- All in due time.

1009
01:15:47,314 --> 01:15:49,817
Sit, relax.

1010
01:15:56,223 --> 01:15:57,625
- Are you drunk?

1011
01:15:58,527 --> 01:15:59,960
- Absolutely not.

1012
01:16:00,661 --> 01:16:02,696
Why, I'm barely this side of tipsy.

1013
01:16:03,964 --> 01:16:04,865
Here we are.

1014
01:16:06,367 --> 01:16:07,635
Let's have a toast.

1015
01:16:08,369 --> 01:16:09,303
- I'm not in the mood.

1016
01:16:09,403 --> 01:16:11,405
- Oh, but you will be, dear brother.

1017
01:16:11,506 --> 01:16:12,606
I swear it.

1018
01:16:14,875 --> 01:16:17,144
Come on, have a drink with me.

1019
01:16:18,245 --> 01:16:19,146
Just one.

1020
01:16:21,482 --> 01:16:24,318
(glass shatters)

1021
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:27,321
Whiskey, then?

1022
01:16:27,421 --> 01:16:28,756
- Stop fucking around.

1023
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:37,698
- You knock a 22-year-old
glass of Amontillado

1024
01:16:37,798 --> 01:16:40,801
out of my hands in a fit of jealous rage

1025
01:16:40,901 --> 01:16:44,772
and ask me to stop
fucking around? (laughs)

1026
01:16:46,607 --> 01:16:51,245
Now, I'm going to fetch you another glas

1027
01:16:51,345 --> 01:16:54,014
and you are going to summon
the courage to apologize.

1028
01:16:54,115 --> 01:16:56,650
And then we'll toast to your good fortun

1029
01:16:57,519 --> 01:16:59,286
- What good fortune?

1030
01:16:59,386 --> 01:17:01,122
- It seems, dear brother,

1031
01:17:01,222 --> 01:17:05,626
that you have won the
heart of our maiden fair.

1032
01:17:06,794 --> 01:17:09,130
I've talked with her
and she most definitely

1033
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:11,499
and without hesitation, wants you back.

1034
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,833
- She said that?

1035
01:17:12,933 --> 01:17:14,569
- I'd like to take credit
for this turn of events,

1036
01:17:14,668 --> 01:17:17,838
but I must admit I had
little to do with it.

1037
01:17:17,938 --> 01:17:19,306
Scarcely had I mentioned your visit,

1038
01:17:19,406 --> 01:17:21,610
and the poor girl fell to her
knees with tears in her eyes

1039
01:17:21,709 --> 01:17:24,812
and professed her undying love for you.

1040
01:17:24,912 --> 01:17:25,980
"I knew he loved me.

1041
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:29,416
"I knew he cared," and so forth and so o

1042
01:17:30,317 --> 01:17:35,122
So congratulations is in
order, for you at least.

1043
01:17:36,657 --> 01:17:37,592
- William, I'm sorry.

1044
01:17:37,691 --> 01:17:38,659
- Yes, but not sorry enough,

1045
01:17:38,759 --> 01:17:42,062
I'm sure, to refuse the lady's advances.

1046
01:17:42,163 --> 01:17:45,132
A congratulations and a toast is in orde

1047
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:46,901
Under the circumstances,

1048
01:17:47,001 --> 01:17:49,303
I'm sure you can understand my insistenc

1049
01:17:50,938 --> 01:17:52,873
I refuse to drink alone.

1050
01:17:58,212 --> 01:17:59,413
Bottoms up.

1051
01:17:59,514 --> 01:18:02,683
(glasses clinking)

1052
01:18:19,166 --> 01:18:20,100
- Where is she?

1053
01:18:20,201 --> 01:18:21,835
- You haven't said
anything about the house.

1054
01:18:21,936 --> 01:18:24,171
- What?
- How it looks.

1055
01:18:26,207 --> 01:18:27,341
- It looks fine.

1056
01:18:27,441 --> 01:18:30,545
- Well, I couldn't have
you think badly of me.

1057
01:18:30,645 --> 01:18:32,446
I couldn't live with myself if you

1058
01:18:32,547 --> 01:18:34,348
thought badly of me, dear brother.

1059
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:37,952
- William, where is she?

1060
01:18:38,052 --> 01:18:41,188
- She's in the cellar,
if you believe that.

1061
01:18:45,527 --> 01:18:46,827
I said she wanted you back.

1062
01:18:46,927 --> 01:18:50,331
I did not say that she
had all of her faculties.

1063
01:18:50,431 --> 01:18:54,435
She calls it her hideout,
says it makes her feel safe.

1064
01:18:54,536 --> 01:18:55,903
She sleeps down there.

1065
01:18:56,003 --> 01:18:58,005
Sometimes I sleep with her.

1066
01:18:58,105 --> 01:19:01,676
Just sleep, mind you, not
that I want much more.

1067
01:19:01,775 --> 01:19:03,277
Hygiene issues. (chuckles)

1068
01:19:03,377 --> 01:19:06,013
You really know how to
pick 'em, big brother.

1069
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:09,950
- Let's go see her then.

1070
01:19:11,118 --> 01:19:13,521
- Finish your drink,
you'll be glad you did.

1071
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:23,565
(basement door creaking)

1072
01:19:23,665 --> 01:19:26,500
(steps clanging)

1073
01:19:34,141 --> 01:19:37,444
- [Wilson] What the hell is down here?

1074
01:19:37,545 --> 01:19:40,414
- [William] The love of
our lives, dear brother.

1075
01:19:40,515 --> 01:19:41,415
Dear brother.

1076
01:19:42,783 --> 01:19:44,552
Whew.

1077
01:19:44,653 --> 01:19:45,953
- You all right, little brother?

1078
01:19:46,053 --> 01:19:48,289
- Oh, that you should be so lucky, sir,

1079
01:19:48,389 --> 01:19:51,492
to be rid of me in such
a neat and tidy fashion.

1080
01:19:52,226 --> 01:19:53,994
- Don't say things like that.

1081
01:19:54,094 --> 01:19:55,896
- Oh, I think I will.

1082
01:19:55,996 --> 01:19:57,398
I think I'll say exactly what I mean

1083
01:19:57,498 --> 01:20:00,467
to say to you, right now.

1084
01:20:03,772 --> 01:20:04,972
- So where is she?

1085
01:20:05,072 --> 01:20:07,408
- Oh, I'm sure she's
around here somewhere.

1086
01:20:08,442 --> 01:20:09,443
Anna?

1087
01:20:10,411 --> 01:20:14,582
My darling, Anna, dearest
friend and confidante.

1088
01:20:17,752 --> 01:20:18,986
- She's not down here?

1089
01:20:19,086 --> 01:20:22,022
- Oh, I'm sure she is.

1090
01:20:22,724 --> 01:20:23,758
Why don't you have a look?

1091
01:20:23,857 --> 01:20:26,561
(hand patting)

1092
01:20:28,295 --> 01:20:29,263
Anna?

1093
01:20:32,866 --> 01:20:33,967
- [Wilson] Anna?

1094
01:20:35,102 --> 01:20:36,837
- [William] Anna.

1095
01:20:39,239 --> 01:20:40,709
- [Wilson] What the fuck is that?

1096
01:20:40,809 --> 01:20:41,743
- Oh.

1097
01:20:41,842 --> 01:20:42,943
(hands clap)

1098
01:20:43,043 --> 01:20:45,647
Good job, brother.

1099
01:20:45,747 --> 01:20:49,283
I think you found her.
(light clicks)

1100
01:20:52,186 --> 01:20:52,754
- What?

1101
01:20:52,853 --> 01:20:56,056
- Say hello, dear brother.

1102
01:20:58,892 --> 01:21:01,495
Say hello to the love of your life.

1103
01:21:04,064 --> 01:21:07,301
I said say hello!

1104
01:21:07,401 --> 01:21:10,237
(dramatic music)

1105
01:21:15,242 --> 01:21:17,612
Tell her you love her, dear brother.

1106
01:21:17,712 --> 01:21:19,046
She's here for you.

1107
01:21:19,146 --> 01:21:21,048
She only wants you.

1108
01:21:21,148 --> 01:21:22,883
Doesn't that make you happy?

1109
01:21:23,951 --> 01:21:25,185
She's coming for you.

1110
01:21:25,285 --> 01:21:28,523
She's coming to make
you her groom. (laughs)

1111
01:21:29,990 --> 01:21:30,825
(ladder rattles)

1112
01:21:30,924 --> 01:21:34,863
(Wilson groans)
(head bangs)

1113
01:21:34,962 --> 01:21:37,931
There the traveler meets, aghast,

1114
01:21:38,031 --> 01:21:40,300
sheeted memories of the past.

1115
01:21:42,469 --> 01:21:45,372
(trowel scraping)

1116
01:21:51,945 --> 01:21:55,382
(Wilson groans softly)

1117
01:22:02,791 --> 01:22:04,057
(handcuffs jangling)

1118
01:22:04,158 --> 01:22:07,327
(muffled shouting)

1119
01:22:11,265 --> 01:22:13,066
Welcome back to the living.

1120
01:22:13,167 --> 01:22:16,604
Though I must admit, you find
yourself in a predicament.

1121
01:22:18,472 --> 01:22:19,339
(muffled shouting)

1122
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,975
I'll spare you the tedium of explanation

1123
01:22:22,075 --> 01:22:23,944
but I will say this.

1124
01:22:24,044 --> 01:22:25,312
Everything you see around you,

1125
01:22:25,412 --> 01:22:29,216
every inference your
sluggish mind will make,

1126
01:22:29,316 --> 01:22:31,519
is exactly as you perceive it.

1127
01:22:33,822 --> 01:22:35,289
I'll give you a moment.

1128
01:22:36,089 --> 01:22:41,328
(muffled shouting)
(handcuffs jangling)

1129
01:22:43,096 --> 01:22:45,098
(trowel scraping)
(muffled groaning)

1130
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:48,502
(handcuffs rattling)

1131
01:22:51,706 --> 01:22:53,575
(muffled shouting)

1132
01:22:53,675 --> 01:22:55,409
You seem to take matters easily.

1133
01:22:56,744 --> 01:23:00,047
I really wonder at your patience
under the circumstances.

1134
01:23:01,749 --> 01:23:02,750
(muffled shouting)

1135
01:23:02,851 --> 01:23:07,020
But in truth, I am in no degree to blame

1136
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:08,857
Instead, I would hope,
though I know it seems an

1137
01:23:08,957 --> 01:23:11,024
unreasonable request, for your gratitude

1138
01:23:11,826 --> 01:23:14,995
Horror and fatality have been
stalking abroad in all ages.

1139
01:23:15,095 --> 01:23:18,065
And yet, for the next few moments,

1140
01:23:18,165 --> 01:23:20,234
should you choose to accept a noble end,

1141
01:23:20,334 --> 01:23:24,037
I have freed you from all manner of fear

1142
01:23:25,607 --> 01:23:26,508
Do you follow?

1143
01:23:27,976 --> 01:23:29,076
I hope you do.

1144
01:23:29,944 --> 01:23:31,679
I mean to say, how can you fear that

1145
01:23:31,779 --> 01:23:35,048
which is already upon you?

1146
01:23:40,688 --> 01:23:43,591
(trowel scraping)

1147
01:23:49,196 --> 01:23:50,430
You need no longer be concerned

1148
01:23:50,532 --> 01:23:55,603
with the proprieties of
space or of time. (chuckles)

1149
01:24:00,008 --> 01:24:01,910
You're free, brother.

1150
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:06,246
Free to contemplate, to
analyze, to understand,

1151
01:24:06,346 --> 01:24:11,184
to see with a fullness of
vision your own ending.

1152
01:24:11,285 --> 01:24:14,154
Now I dare not deign to
tell you your business

1153
01:24:14,254 --> 01:24:15,489
or your meaning, but I will leave you

1154
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:19,259
with this one suggestion to ponder.

1155
01:24:20,795 --> 01:24:24,197
Nothing you have ever done,
nothing you've ever said

1156
01:24:24,298 --> 01:24:29,102
or thought or written means anything.

1157
01:24:36,711 --> 01:24:39,479
(Wilson laughs)

1158
01:24:40,748 --> 01:24:43,585
(William laughs)

1159
01:24:44,484 --> 01:24:47,187
Have you gone mad so
quickly, dear brother?

1160
01:24:48,255 --> 01:24:51,325
Or do you just choose to die laughing?

1161
01:24:52,426 --> 01:24:56,496
Which must be the most glorious
of all glorious deaths.

1162
01:24:58,666 --> 01:25:01,435
(Wilson laughs)

1163
01:25:02,169 --> 01:25:05,205
(eerie laughing)

1164
01:25:14,983 --> 01:25:17,752
(Wilson laughs)

1165
01:25:21,789 --> 01:25:24,626
(dramatic music)

1166
01:25:28,997 --> 01:25:32,499
(floor creaking softly)

1167
01:25:38,806 --> 01:25:41,576
(door creaking)

1168
01:25:48,315 --> 01:25:51,552
(distant screaming)

1169
01:25:55,155 --> 01:25:58,258
(suspenseful music)

1170
01:25:58,358 --> 01:26:01,328
(blood pouring)

1171
01:26:09,369 --> 01:26:12,272
(loud banging)

1172
01:26:14,075 --> 01:26:17,310
(suspenseful music)

1173
01:26:23,017 --> 01:26:25,720
(loud banging)

1174
01:26:29,724 --> 01:26:34,962
(distant laughing)
(suspenseful music)

1175
01:26:43,638 --> 01:26:46,339
(loud banging)

1176
01:26:49,177 --> 01:26:52,279
(thrilling music)

1177
01:27:42,830 --> 01:27:47,267
Let me call myself for
the moment, William.

1178
01:27:47,367 --> 01:27:49,203
(suspenseful violin music)

1179
01:27:49,302 --> 01:27:51,371
I'm a storyteller by nature.

1180
01:27:52,206 --> 01:27:54,274
I'm a liar in my freer times.

1181
01:27:55,243 --> 01:27:56,443
(suspenseful violin music)

1182
01:27:56,544 --> 01:28:00,648
(Mr. Usher breathing heavily)

1183
01:28:06,154 --> 01:28:08,923
(William cries)

1184
01:28:09,023 --> 01:28:11,192
- I direct my executor
to distribute the residue

1185
01:28:11,291 --> 01:28:13,127
of my estate as follows.

1186
01:28:13,227 --> 01:28:15,730
All assets, possessions and property

1187
01:28:15,830 --> 01:28:19,066
to my only son, William Wilson Usher.

1188
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,636
(suspenseful violin music)

1189
01:28:21,736 --> 01:28:23,604
- William, we have to talk.

1190
01:28:23,704 --> 01:28:25,305
I love you and I'm here for you,

1191
01:28:25,405 --> 01:28:28,976
but this is too much for me.

1192
01:28:29,076 --> 01:28:31,344
It's time to get some help.

1193
01:28:32,213 --> 01:28:33,614
I'm sorry.

1194
01:28:33,714 --> 01:28:37,985
I just can't be the
support you need right now.

1195
01:28:38,085 --> 01:28:42,190
If you want me to be with you,
you have to talk to somebody.

1196
01:28:42,857 --> 01:28:45,425
William, you're seeing
things that aren't there,

1197
01:28:45,526 --> 01:28:48,563
talking to people who aren't real.

1198
01:28:49,462 --> 01:28:52,767
I can't live like this.

1199
01:28:52,867 --> 01:28:54,769
I want to help.

1200
01:28:54,869 --> 01:28:55,837
Can you hear me?

1201
01:28:57,238 --> 01:28:59,807
I just don't know what else to do.

1202
01:29:00,741 --> 01:29:03,744
I think it's best for both
of us if you get help now,

1203
01:29:03,845 --> 01:29:05,580
before you get worse and cut me off,

1204
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:07,615
and I never see you again.

1205
01:29:09,517 --> 01:29:12,820
William, it's time to
let go of that guilt.

1206
01:29:14,454 --> 01:29:15,488
(hammer squelching)

1207
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:17,291
- No part of what I convey is true,

1208
01:29:17,390 --> 01:29:19,093
but every part is truthful.

1209
01:29:19,861 --> 01:29:24,532
I offer now this sad and amended history

1210
01:29:25,233 --> 01:29:27,935
(gentle music)

1211
01:30:12,046 --> 01:30:15,683
(somber orchestral music)

1212
01:30:55,690 --> 01:30:58,559
It was not my hand that stayed her breat

1213
01:31:00,795 --> 01:31:03,564
That is what I would have
you believe, if you will,

1214
01:31:03,664 --> 01:31:07,201
the melancholy tale in which
I choose to reside my truth,

1215
01:31:07,301 --> 01:31:09,370
inasmuch as truth has any bearing

1216
01:31:09,469 --> 01:31:11,471
on the present circumstance.

1217
01:31:12,206 --> 01:31:15,643
Though it does make the tale
nice and neat and pretty,

1218
01:31:15,743 --> 01:31:18,045
as do most lies of narrative.

1219
01:31:18,813 --> 01:31:23,050
But for you, my lowly audience,

1220
01:31:24,251 --> 01:31:27,154
I fear a resolution will be abrupt.

1221
01:31:28,488 --> 01:31:29,724
And inconclusive.

1222
01:31:30,992 --> 01:31:34,362
For the value of a good tale
lies not in its denouement,

1223
01:31:34,462 --> 01:31:37,665
but in its serpentine unwieldy unfolding

1224
01:31:39,967 --> 01:31:41,202
More than that,

1225
01:31:43,004 --> 01:31:48,209
I've grown tired and feeble and cold.

1226
01:31:49,577 --> 01:31:51,746
There's a tickle in my throat,

1227
01:31:51,846 --> 01:31:53,814
and my breath has become my fear.

1228
01:31:54,582 --> 01:31:58,586
A short rasp of its former self.

1229
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:03,024
(crickets chirping)

1230
01:32:07,028 --> 01:32:10,131
(match striking)
(flame hissing)

1231
01:32:10,231 --> 01:32:13,868
(mysterious whispering)

1232
01:32:13,968 --> 01:32:15,369
(match clanks)

1233
01:32:15,469 --> 01:32:18,572
(thrilling music)

1234
01:32:28,616 --> 01:32:32,319
(suspenseful violin music)
