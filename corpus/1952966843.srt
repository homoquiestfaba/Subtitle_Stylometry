NARRATOR: <i>'Twas three</i>
<i>nights before Christmas</i>
<i>at the magical North Pole,</i>

2
00:00:33,847 --> 00:00:39,001
<i>and all the new elves</i>
<i>had gathered round Santa</i>
<i>to be given their roles.</i>

3
00:00:39,087 --> 00:00:42,875
<i>''Toy-making elf!''</i>
<i>Santa decreed</i>
<i>to the first one in line,</i>

4
00:00:43,007 --> 00:00:47,637
<i>and to the next,</i>
<i>and the next,</i>
<i>and the next 209.</i>

5
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:50,925
<i>But when Santa came</i>
<i>to the last elf</i>
<i>standing there,</i>

6
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:55,000
<i>something very different</i>
<i>he was to declare!</i>

7
00:00:55,327 --> 00:00:58,842
<i>''Stable elf!''</i>
<i>he proclaimed,</i>
<i>expecting a cheer.</i>

8
00:00:58,967 --> 00:01:02,357
<i>''You'll be the one in charge</i>
<i>of all things reindeer.</i>

9
00:01:02,727 --> 00:01:04,922
<i>''You'll talk to them</i>
<i>and make them all fly.</i>

<i>of the magic berries</i>

11
00:01:07,807 --> 00:01:10,719
<i>''that carry them</i>
<i>into the sky. ''</i>

12
00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:13,003
<i>But a cheer</i>
<i>he did not receive.</i>

13
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:15,123
<i>Nor a smile,</i>
<i>nor a chuckle.</i>

14
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:18,559
<i>Instead, poor Henry's</i>
<i>knees started to buckle.</i>

15
00:01:18,647 --> 00:01:22,765
<i>''I don't like reindeer, ''</i>
<i>he protested,</i>
<i>''Or any animal, I mean,</i>

16
00:01:22,847 --> 00:01:26,999
<i>''they slobber and shed</i>
<i>and are so very unclean. ''</i>

17
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:30,765
<i>But Santa's mind</i>
<i>was made up,</i>
<i>that much was clear.</i>

18
00:01:30,847 --> 00:01:33,964
<i>So that night,</i>
<i>Henry came up</i>
<i>with a plan,</i>

19
00:01:34,047 --> 00:01:35,639
<i>to change his career.</i>

20
00:01:36,127 --> 00:01:40,006
<i>He would make</i>
<i>a toy of his own</i>
<i>as a secret surprise.</i>

21
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:44,599
<i>One that will force</i>
<i>the big man to see</i>
<i>him with new eyes!</i>

22
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:49,165
<i>But Henry's toy-making skills</i>
<i>were a long way from strong</i>

23
00:01:49,247 --> 00:01:52,956
<i>and before he knew it,</i>
<i>things went wronger</i>
<i>than wrong!</i>

24
00:01:53,887 --> 00:01:56,355
<i>Now, reindeer</i>
<i>are well-trained.</i>

25

<i>They can sit,</i>
<i>stay and heel.</i>

26

<i>they'll pass up a free meal.</i>

you think of it,

1500
01:17:55,727 --> 01:17:58,480
that probably wouldn<i>'</i>t
be the worst thing for
our company either.

1501
01:17:58,607 --> 01:17:59,596
(REXFORD LAUGHS)

1502
01:17:59,687 --> 01:18:02,076
l tell you what,
you tell me what schedule
you want to work on,

1503
01:18:02,167 --> 01:18:04,601
and l promise you,
we<i>'</i>ll arrange it.

1504
01:18:06,447 --> 01:18:08,165
Thank you, Mr. Rexford.

1505
01:18:08,447 --> 01:18:09,926
Thank you.

1506
01:18:14,287 --> 01:18:16,926
Thank you so much
for your help on this.

1507
01:18:17,927 --> 01:18:19,042
Tell you what,

1508
01:18:19,167 --> 01:18:21,806
tomorrow why don<i>'</i>t we go
down and pick you up one
of those MegaStations?

1509
01:18:22,767 --> 01:18:23,961
Huh. (CHUCKLES)

1510
01:18:24,047 --> 01:18:25,082
Actually, Mom,

1511
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:28,204
l<i>'</i>ve decided that there
are more constructive
uses of my time.

1512
01:18:28,487 --> 01:18:30,478
Like maybe taking
care of a dog.

1513
01:18:35,887 --> 01:18:37,286
What do you say?
Keep him?

1514
01:18:37,487 --> 01:18:38,840
Thought you didn<i>'</i>t
like dogs.

1515
01:18:39,647 --> 01:18:42,764
(LAUGHS)
l didn<i>'</i>t think so either,
but he chose me.

1516
01:18:44,407 --> 01:18:45,760
Welcome to the family,
little guy.

1517
01:18:47,407 --> 01:18:48,476
Thanks, Mom.

1518
01:18:49,007 --> 01:18:50,235
Merry Christmas.

1519
01:18:51,567 --> 01:18:52,761
Merry Christmas, baby.

1520
01:18:53,327 --> 01:18:57,036
Hey, guys, do you think
that we can get me back
to the North Pole?

1521
01:18:57,127 --> 01:18:58,606
My bells are still
on the line here.

1522
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:00,439
Oh!
Yeah. Um...

1523
01:19:00,527 --> 01:19:01,516
Yeah.

1524
01:19:13,847 --> 01:19:14,836
(GRUNTS)

1525
01:19:16,407 --> 01:19:17,886
You think you can
make it back in this?

1526
01:19:18,407 --> 01:19:21,956
Yeah, l mean
it looks fine,
but one problem.

1527
01:19:22,847 --> 01:19:24,803
Who<i>'</i>s supposed
to fly it?
(BEETHOVEN BARKS)

1528
01:19:27,047 --> 01:19:28,116
BEETHOVEN: Come on, elf.

1529
01:19:28,567 --> 01:19:29,682
HENRY: The magic berries.

1530
01:19:29,847 --> 01:19:31,360
lf they can make
a reindeer fly,

1531
01:19:31,447 --> 01:19:33,563
then they can
make a dog fly.
(BEETHOVEN BARKS)

1532
01:19:41,487 --> 01:19:44,047
Well, so long, Mason.

1533
01:19:45,527 --> 01:19:46,880
l just want to
thank you so much

1534
01:19:46,967 --> 01:19:48,241
for helping me find
Santa<i>'</i>s toy bag.

1535
01:19:49,167 --> 01:19:50,725
Couldn<i>'</i>t have done
it without you, man.

1536
01:19:51,567 --> 01:19:53,762
And l wanna thank you
for something else, too.

1537
01:19:54,047 --> 01:19:55,036
What<i>'</i>s that?

1538
01:19:55,487 --> 01:19:56,556
(SlGHS)

1539
01:19:59,167 --> 01:20:02,477
For helping me see that
Santa was right about me.

1540
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:05,966
You know,
l am a stable elf.

1541
01:20:06,367 --> 01:20:09,962
And different or not,

1542
01:20:12,247 --> 01:20:13,919
l wouldn<i>'</i>t wanna
be anything else.

1543
01:20:15,487 --> 01:20:17,239
No problem, Henry.

1544
01:20:17,847 --> 01:20:19,838
And l guess
l should thank you
for something, too.

1545
01:20:21,167 --> 01:20:22,486
Thanks for
making me realize

1546
01:20:23,607 --> 01:20:24,642
that believing
in Santa Claus

1547
01:20:24,727 --> 01:20:26,046
is definitely not
a little kid thing.

1548
01:20:29,367 --> 01:20:31,642
l am gonna need some
time for the tooth fairy
and Easter Bunny, though.

1549
01:20:34,167 --> 01:20:36,237
Yeah, all right.

1550
01:20:40,407 --> 01:20:41,635
Merry Christmas.

1551
01:20:42,287 --> 01:20:44,323
All right.
Merry Christmas.
(STRAY LAUGHS)

1552
01:20:44,487 --> 01:20:45,681
You ready, Beethoven?

1553
01:20:46,887 --> 01:20:47,922
Onward.

1554
01:20:49,687 --> 01:20:50,961
(LAUGHlNG)
STRAY: Goodbye, big fella.

1555
01:20:51,167 --> 01:20:52,600
Goodbye!

CHRlSTlNE:
Bye, Beethoven.

1559
01:20:57,207 --> 01:20:58,322
BEETHOVEN: Hold on.

1560
01:21:01,327 --> 01:21:02,396
Coming home,
here we go.

1561
01:21:02,487 --> 01:21:03,476
MASON: See you
later, Beethoven.

1562
01:21:03,607 --> 01:21:05,040
Merry Christmas, guys.

1563
01:21:05,127 --> 01:21:06,526
BEETHOVEN: Merry Christmas.

1564
01:21:09,527 --> 01:21:11,324
So what are you
gonna name him?

1565
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:14,158
l think l<i>'</i>m gonna
name him after someone

1566
01:21:14,247 --> 01:21:16,203
who really helped us
out this Christmas.

1567
01:21:16,407 --> 01:21:20,241
Hey, what do you think
of the name Henry
or Hank for short?

1568
01:21:24,927 --> 01:21:25,962
BEETHOVEN: So long.

1569
01:21:26,847 --> 01:21:29,725
HENRY: (LAUGHlNG)
Merry Christmas!

NARRATOR: <i>In the end,</i>
<i>Santa made all</i>
<i>his deliveries,</i>

1571
01:21:39,727 --> 01:21:42,480
<i>and the holiday</i>
<i>hit no further snag.</i>

1572
01:21:42,847 --> 01:21:45,077
<i>Though it's important</i>
<i>to point out</i>

1573
01:21:45,287 --> 01:21:47,755
<i>that the best gifts</i>
<i>received that year</i>

1574
01:21:48,047 --> 01:21:50,436
<i>came not from his bag.</i>

1575
01:21:50,647 --> 01:21:53,115
<i>For little Hank,</i>
<i>it was a home,</i>

1576
01:21:53,207 --> 01:21:54,879
<i>and a happy one at that.</i>

1577
01:21:55,287 --> 01:21:59,439
<i>For Henry, it was</i>
<i>a calling he would</i>
<i>never give back.</i>

1578
01:22:00,087 --> 01:22:04,239
<i>For Christine and Mason,</i>
<i>it was something</i>
<i>enduring and true,</i>

1579
01:22:04,647 --> 01:22:08,799
<i>the gift of a healing</i>
<i>that was long overdue.</i>

1580
01:22:09,167 --> 01:22:11,681
<i>And as for our old</i>
<i>friend Beethoven,</i>

1581
01:22:12,567 --> 01:22:16,606
<i>it was the thanks of</i>
<i>one very grateful elf.</i>

1582
01:22:17,287 --> 01:22:19,801
<i>As well as</i>
<i>a special</i>
<i>ride home</i>

1583

<i>from the big man himself.</i>

1584

People are crooks!
