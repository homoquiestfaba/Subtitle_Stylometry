00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,000
Jack Reacher Never Go Back (2016)

2
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,200
Pardon me. excuse me, step aside please.

3
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,350
Jesus Christ!

4
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,040
Lee's Diner.

5
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:07,030
There are four down. I'll need two MS vehicles.

6
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,030
What the hell happened here?

7
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,020
Somebody run 'em over?

8
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,020
Nah, man.

9
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,030
It was a fight.

10
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,030
One guy took them all out in like seconds.

11
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,050
He's still in there.

12
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,030
That's him.

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,020
Turn around, mister.

14
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,040
Let me see your hands.

15
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,040
Slowly.

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,040
Military ID. Expired.

17
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:47,020
$38 bucks.

18
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,020
And a toothbrush.

19
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,050
And no home address.

20
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,030
In other words, homeless.

21
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:00,040
Aggravated assault is a second-degree felony in
this state, Mr ...


22
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,050
Reacher. First name Jack. No middle name.

23
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:10,030
You're looking at 10 to 20 years, once thse boys
you beat out there are fit to testify.


24
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,020
Process him. Get him to County.

25
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,020
Two things are going to happen in the next 90
seconds.


26
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,020
Excuse me?

27
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,040
First,

28
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,040
that phone over there's going to ring.

29
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,040
Second,

30
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,050
you're going to be wearing these cuffs on your
way to prison.


31
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,040
Hahahehe, that is one magnificent prophecy, Mr.
Reacher.


32
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,040
That'll be a Major Turner of the 110th CID Police
in Alexandria, Virginia.


33
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,030
You and those boys out there wade a mistake,

34
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,020
operating on land owned by the US Army.

35
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,030
What are you talking about?

36
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,030
Kidnapping illegals.

37
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,040
Selling ​​them.

38
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,020
MP's are on the way now.

39
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,040
If it were up to me, I'd just kill you.

40
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,030
Just going to keep on ringing.

41
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,040
Sherif Raymond Wood.

42
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,020
Who the hell are you?

43
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,040
The guy you didn't count on.

44
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,030
Thank you.

45
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:32,020
United States Army 110, Sergeant Leach.

46
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,030
Major Turner, please.

47
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,030
One moment please.

48
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,030
This is Turner.

49
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,030
Major S. Turner?

50
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,050
This is she. Who am I speaking to?

51
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,040
Jack Reacher.

52
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,030
No kidding?

53
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,030
Well it's nice to finally speak.

54
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,030
Thanks for tipping us off to that sheriff.

55
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,020
You know, I ...

56
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,030
I wanted to thank you for helping me.

57
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,020
Out of a tight spot, huh?

58
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,030
Isn't that what army folks do for each other,
Major?


59
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,040
ex Major.

60
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,040
Oh, once a Major always a Major.

61
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,040
Where are you calling from?

62
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,020
Uh, outside Independence I think.

63
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,030
You're not sure?

64
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,050
It doesn't really matter, I move around a lot.

65
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,030
So I've heard.

66
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,030
What else have you heard?

67
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,040
Oh, come on, you're a legend around here.

68
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,030
Some folks still wonder why you left.

69
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,030
Let's say I ...

70
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,020
woke up one morning and the uniform didn't fit.

71
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,030
US Army, 110, Sergeant Leach.

72
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,020
Jack Reacher for Major Turner.

73
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,020
Hold on, Major.

74
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,040
Reacher.

75
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,050
How's my office?

76
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,040
I'm sitting here now.

77
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:49,020
You know, there is this big dent in the desk.

78
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,020
And people say you made with someone's head.

79
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,030
Is that true?

80
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,040
It was not my finest hour.

81
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,020
You're not in trouble again, are you?

82
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,050
I'm afraid you have a way of finding it.

83
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,030
Or...

84
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,030
looking for it.

85
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:09,040
You know, I was thinking maybe I owe you dinner
for what you did.


86
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,040
Oh, dinner well it took you a while to come to
that conclusion.


87
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,050
When are you coming to DC?

88
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,030
I'll get there eventually.

89
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:21,020
Well then I won't hold my breath.

90
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,040
You're not saying anything.

91
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,050
I'm deciding whether I'd like you in person.

92
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,030
Which way are you leaning.

93
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,020
On the fence.

94
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,030
I'm not sure you can handle me.

95
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,040
I'm not worried.

96
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,020
oh, worry ...

97
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,020
just a little.

98
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,020
Take care of yourself, Reacher.

99
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,030
Jack Reacher, for Major Turner.

100
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
Major Reacher.

101
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,040
Sergeant Leach, we've spoken on the phone.

102
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,020
Welcome back.

103
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,040
Just Reacher.

104
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,030
I'm a civilian now.

105
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,040
Yes Sir.

106
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,030
I'll take you up.

107
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,050
I'm sorry, I was looking...

108
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,040
Come in, Major.

109
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,040
Sam Morgan.

110
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,030
Please come in. Come in.

111
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,030
Have a seat.

112
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,040
I've heard a lot about you.

113
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,020
Stopping by to see Major Turner.

114
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,050
Oh, well, that's a problem.

115
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,040
Major Turner has been relieved of her command.

116
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,040
I spoke with her a few days ago.

117
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,040
She's been arrested.

118
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,020
Court martial's pending.

119
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,030
On what charge?

120
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,020
Espionage.

121
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:57,020
I'm assuming her duties until a replacement is
assigned.


122
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,040
Is there something I can help you with?

123
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,030
No. Just a personal visit.

124
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,030
You know each other from back when you we're C.O.
here?


125
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,040
Nope. Never met her.

126
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,030
I'm sorry to give you the bad news, Major.

127
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,030
ex Major.

128
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,030
Sir, I wanted to warn you.

129
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,030
But?

130
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,030
Ordered not to.

131
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,030
Colonel Morgan, directly.

132
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,040
Maybe you should warn me now.

133
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,040
Speak freely Sergeant.

134
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,040
Major Turner is an excellent officer, sir.

135
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,020
Has she been assigned an attorney yet?

136
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,040
Ordered not to give out any information about
that, sir.


137
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,030
Understood.

138
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,030
Always follow orders, Sergeant.

139
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,030
Yes, Sir.

140
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:47,020
Just curious, who was your DI in boot camp?

141
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,020
Sergeant Green, sir.

142
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,020
Well, let's say, if Sergeant Green were having
legal troubles.


143
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,040
Would you be able to recommend an attorney for
him?


144
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,030
Oh.

145
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,030
Yes.

146
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:06,020
Definitely I'd recommend Colonel Moorcroft over
at Fort Dyer, for the highest security person you
can find, sir.


147
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,040
Colonel.

148
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,050
You're the assigned counsel for Major Susan
Turner.


149
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,040
I'm Jack Reacher.

150
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,030
Former Commander of the 110th.

151
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,030
I was wondering when you were going to show up.

152
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:31,030
Major Turner requested under no circumstances are
you to be granted visitation privileges.


153
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,030
Why would she say that?

154
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,030
Maybe she read your file.

155
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:39,030
Anti-authority, anti-social, anti lawyer,
deadbeat dad?


156
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,040
Excuse me?

157
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,050
Says here you never paid child support.

158
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,020
I'm not a father.

159
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:48,040
Well, a woman named Candice Dutton begs to differ.

160
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,040
She contacted the army seeking compensation for
her daughter.


161
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,040
Samantha Dutton, she's 15 now.

162
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,020
This is a mistake.

163
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,040
They usually are.

164
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,030
Mother's got two priors, prostitution, possession.

165
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:07,030
The kid's been in and out of foster care her
whole life.


166
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,040
Any feelings anything about that?

167
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,020
About foster care?

168
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,020
Life sucks.

169
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,020
I meant the kid.

170
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,050
I don't have a kid. I've never heard of Candice
Dutton.


171
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,030
I'm here about Major Turner.

172
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,020
What evidence do they have?

173
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,030
A hard drive.

174
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:27,020
Containing classified information that was found
at Major Turner's residence.


175
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,030
The inference being she's selling secrets.

176
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,050
And that's it?

177
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:36,040
What do you want? A picture of her wearing a
burka and having drinks with the Taliban?


178
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,030
What did she tell you?

179
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,040
Can't talk to her until tomorrow.

180
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,030
Public safety exception.

181
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,030
And you accepted that?

182
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,040
Where did you get your law degree?

183
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,040
Oh...

184
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:55,020
It's possible you were once a good lawyer,

2 weeks ago, Major Turner dispatches them to
Afghanistan on an investigation.

And they file reports daily.

00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,020
- Move! - Move in!

361
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,030
Secure!

362
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:10,030
They're in the food truck! Stop that truck! Go!
Go! Go!


363
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,040
- Go! Go! - Move!

364
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,050
- Out of the truck! - Hands up now! - Get them
out of that truck.


365
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,040
Open!

366
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:39,030
Clear!

367
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,030
So now I'm a fugitive from justice.

368
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,040
And a traitor to your country, don't forget that.

369
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:50,040
Why do I feel like you're enjoying this?

370
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,040
You have a very interesting way of saying thank
you.


371
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,040
Were those men really going to kill me?

372
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,030
Thank you.

373
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,040
nice job.

374
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:11,020
oh his ass is mine. XO, one of our vehicles has
been hijacked, L67.


375
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:15,020
All units suspects travelling MP vehicle L67.

376
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,040
Primary is Jack Reacher, white male who is
considered armed and dangerous.


377
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:25,020
Secondary is Major Susan Turner, female wearing
military fatigues, white, age 34.


378
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,040
- Really? - Shut up.

379
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,020
We need to ditch this car and get into my email.

380
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,020
Alright people, lets go lets go. Where the hell
are they?


381
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,020
Specialist have the state troopers called back
yet?.


382
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,040
- On it Sir. - Alright has anybody heard from the
capitol police?


383
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:41,030
Anybody? Anything, A location something?

384
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,020
Is there still an internet cafe around here?

385
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:00,040
-  Pennsylvania and North Street. - Take us there
please.


386
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,030
Should have gone to Afghanistan myself.

387
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,040
Merkovich and Cibelli were my responsibility.

388
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:21,020
The job is about giving orders.

389
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:24,030
Did you ever lose anyone on your watch Reacher?

390
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,030
My men were't killed by the Taliban.

391
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:35,020
They were shot in the back of his head, with
slugs from an army issue 9mm.


392
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,030
By one of our own.

393
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,030
I'm going to find out who did it.

394
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,030
What are your guy's doing over there? What are
they looking for?


395
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,020
Weapons.

396
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:48,030
Dozens of weapons decommissioned during the draw
down.


397
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,040
Whole plane loads gone missing.

398
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,040
Hey, I like your hat.

399
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,030
- You Nat's fan - Yeah, from the beginning.

400
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,030
They arrested me the day after my investigators
were killed.


401
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:10,040
The time difference, they might have filed
another report.


402
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,030
They locked me up so I wouldn't see it.

403
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:18,040
Sir, she is trying to access the system.

404
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,040
- Get me that location. - Yes, Sir.

405
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,020
Pensylvania and North Street.

406
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:30,040
It's Morgan, ready to go to work soldier?

407
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,040
We've located them..

408
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:35,030
They're at an internet cafe at Pennsylvania and
North Street.


409
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:37,020
Get it done.

410
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:42,030
Whatever Merkovich and Cibelli found out got them
killed.


411
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,050
But by who?

412
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:47,040
[ACCESS DENIED] Shit, they locked me out.

413
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:09,020
- They can find you like this. - Yes I know, just
give me a second, ok?


414
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:14,020
- They will know this location. - I need a
minute. - They will know this location. Shit,
lets get.


415
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,040
There is a bus stop on the other side of the park.

416
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,050
We're being followed, it's not a cop.

417
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:43,040
He's a pro.

418
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,050
Where?

419
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,040
50 yards.

420
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,030
Black coat, brown hair.

421
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,040
There.

422
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,030
- They made us? - Maybe.

423
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,030
Restaurant.

424
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,040
- Hello. - Meeting someone in the back.

425
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,030
- Everybody out! - Lets go!

426
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:40,020
- Out! Move!

427
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,030
Come on, lets go, get out!

428
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,040
I got this door.

429
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,020
Stay back, Stay back!

430
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,030
Police! Freeze!

431
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:19,030
Drop your weapon!

432
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:23,030
- Sir, I said drop your weapon! - I'm military
police!


433
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:26,040
He's not a cop.

434
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,040
Sir, drop your weapon.

435
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,030
- I'm military police. - Sir, I need you to drop
your weapon.


436
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:35,020
Listen, I know I know what this looks like, I
know - turn around and let me see your hands on
your head!


437
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:37,020
I know, I'm putting that weapon down.

438
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:41,020
Listen to me, I'm military police, these two are
fugitives of the United States Army.


439
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:44,040
- Sir, Sir get your hands behind your head. - I
understand, all right I'm turning around, I'm
turning around.


440
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,020
Place your hands behind your head.

441
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:50,050
- Now. - My identification's in my right front
pocket.


442
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:52,030
Will you just check it. Just check it.

443
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,040
Need you to back up, come on! Out of the streets
please! Go, go, go!


444
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,030
We got our signals crossed.

445
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:40,040
He's good.

446
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:43,030
We'll get him next time.

447
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,050
Now I admit being a little jealous when we talk.

448
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:56,040
Go wherer you want, eat when you want.

449
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:00,030
Nobody telling you what to do or how to do it.

450
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:03,040
Definitely not the army way.

451
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:05,030
Exactly.

452
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,030
Take a look at that registration.

453
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,040
Parasource. You think that guy in the kitchen was
one of theirs?


454
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,020
Free lance, is my guess.

455
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,030
Go.

456
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,040
You made a mess I hear.

457
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,020
This Reacher guy, is interesting.

458
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:03,030
You have no idea, we ran out of medals, so don't
make this a competition.


459
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:07,020
- Too late. - Sure you can handle him by yourself?

460
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,020
I can handle him just fine.

461
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,030
Prove it.

462
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,040
- Coffee? - Cream?

463
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,040
No.

464
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,020
Right sizes.

465
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,040
Good eye.

466
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,040
Spent the rest of our cash.

467
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,020
It's time we stopped running and start hunting.

468
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:57,020
- Morgan. - Catch you at a bad time?

469
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,020
I hope you're calling to turn yourselves in.

470
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:04,040
I don't know your role in this yet but I'm
guessing money, I promise you I will find out.


471
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:06,040
Nobody's going to find anything.

472
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,030
Not even in Major Turner's e-mail?

473
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,030
- Find it yet? - Nothing to find.

474
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,040
Check out looking hard enough looking.

475
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,030
Why don't we check my field reports?

476
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:30,050
Snap the tendon before it breaks the bone, takes
longer to heal.


477
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:32,050
Locked,  need the code. - 12.1.9.#

478
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,040
Merkovich and Cibelli's field reports.

479
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,040
What else we got on here, huh?

480
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,030
You think you're invulnerable?

481
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,040
Almost done uploading.

482
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,030
There are ways to get at you Reacher.

483
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,020
Got it.

484
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,050
Thanks for all your help.

485
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,040
Okay, Merkovich and Cibelli did file a final
report.


486
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:25,030
Orlars .. okay, here we go.

487
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:29,030
Last one they spoke to was a contractor named
Daniel Prudhomme.


488
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:35,020
He oversaw weapons transports, said he was
evasive and he disappeared.


489
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,040
This is Leach.

490
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,040
This is Sergeant Green, your old DI, do you
remember me?


491
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,040
Sergeant Green, so good to hear from you.

492
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,020
I'm here with a friend of yours, we need a favor.

493
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:53,040
There's a military contractor called ParaSource,
think you could ask around find out what role
they played in Bagram?


494
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,030
I might be able to do that.

495
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:59,030
Also there's a ParaSource employee named
Prudhomme, we need his whereabouts.


496
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,030
Prudhomme, copy that.

497
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:06,030
- And sergeant, carefully. - Sir, Yes Sir.

498
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,040
Reacher.

499
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,020
Clear.

500
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:03,020
Reacher.

501
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,040
Let go of me!

502
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:25,030
Let go of me!

503
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:28,020
Hey, hey hey!

504
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,020
Okay, it's okay.

505
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,020
???

506
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,040
ok, you said you're not a cop?

507
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,030
I'm not.

508
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,040
- what's Military police? - That's different.

509
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:53,020
But you stole this car.

510
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:58,040
- It's complicated. - Where are you taking me?

511
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,020
We don't know yet.

512
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,040
- Do you have a phone? - Why?

513
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,030
- Give it to me. - I left it in the apartment
wher you kidnapped me.


514
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,050
We didn't kidnap you.

515
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:10,030
Kidnapping is a federal offense.

516
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,020
Look at me kid.

517
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:18,040
There are people out there who want to hurt you.

518
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,050
I feel sick.

519
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,040
Put your head out the window

520
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,030
It doesn't open.

521
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:33,040
- When was te last time you had something to eat?
- I don't know.


522
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,040
We need to get her some food.

523
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:52,040
- How long have you been drawing? - I don't know
why?


524
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:55,040
Just asking.

525
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:57,040
They suck.

526
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,030
Whatever you say.

527
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:06,030
How can they hurt those two nice old hippies,
who'd want to kill them.


528
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:07,040
You've had a shock.

529
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:11,040
Your body's pumping adrenaline cortisol, they
call it fight or flight.


530
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:16,020
It's going to take a while to calm down.

531
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:26,030
I can't eat. I'm pumping adrenaline.

532
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,040
I know a place you'll be safe.

533
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:32,020
What does that mean?

534
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:33,040
I'm not going to a stupid school.

535
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,020
They have a dress code, this is what they wear
there.


536
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,040
I know the head mistress, you'll be safe there.

537
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:40,050
Head mistress, what is it, a convent?

538
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:48,020
Do you want to live? Do you?

539
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,030
Yes.

540
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:56,030
Then you will go where we say and stay until we
say it's safe. Do you understand?


541
00:43:56,050 --> 00:44:02,030
You're very intense you know that. Yeh, I
understand.


542
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:15,050
- What are you doing here? - Reacher has the girl.

543
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,030
You were supposed to take care of that.

544
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:22,040
You people, you take off the uniform and lose all
discipline.


545
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:24,040
How did he find her?

546
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,020
Exactly.

547
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,040
- How did he? - How would I know?

548
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,050
When he here earlier today?

549
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,050
You're watching me now? Who the hell do you think
you are?


550
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:45,030
- What did you give them? - What are you talking
about?


551
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:51,020
What did you give them?

552
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:54,030
I don't have to be interrogated by the likes of
you.


553
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,030
He came in here with that bitch and threatened
me, I give him nothing.


554
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,040
What's so funny. We hired you to clean up this
mess.


555
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:08,020
You're right.

556
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,020
- He touched this phone didn't he? - So?

557
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,050
That means his prints are on it.

558
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:34,040
I mean really, if I, if I had any other choice,
should only be for a few days.


559
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:37,030
You know how we feel about you here, look Susan.

560
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:39,040
- Thank you. - So nice to see you.

561
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:42,020
Good to see you too ..

562
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:03,020
- Welcome to Pembrooke - Hi, I'm Olivia. - and
I'm May.


563
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:06,020
- Carla. - Come sit with us.

564
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,040
- Where'd you go before this? - Different places.

565
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:13,020
ooh that looks really good for college
applications.


566
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,020
- Have you taken the PSAT's yet? - You can sign
up right away.


567
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:19,020
May, oh my god they're earrings, where'd you get
them?


568
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:21,050
Oh thank you, actually my dad brought them back
from New York.


569
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:26,020
my parents promised me some intense retail
therapy when we're in Paris for christmas.


570
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:28,040
- wow, Paris. - (its really..) - It's beautiful ..
could he ?? christmas. - he's cool, - I could tell him.

571
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:00,030
- What are you doing? - You said you didn't have
a phone.


572
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:03,040
- How many times you use this? - In my life?

573
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,040
Let's go, get your things.

574
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:11,030
What, just one person?

575
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:14,030
Excuse me, we have to go.

576
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:17,020
- Thank you. - Excuse me a moment.

577
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,030
Hey, what the hell is going on?

578
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,030
- She was texting. Shit. - What's wrong with that?

579
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:24,030
They can trace us.

580
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,040
Come on, lets go.

581
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,040
Get in.

582
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:46,020
God that place was ridiculous.

583
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:49,030
That place changed my life.

584
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,030
Sorry about the phone.

585
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:58,020
Go. - I did some digging about ParaSource.

586
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:00,040
Some of their boys got into trouble in
Afghanistan.


587
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:04,040
And lost some big government contracts word is
their in financial trouble.


588
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,020
Why does he get to have a phone?

589
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:08,040
- Daniel Prudhomme. - You need to be quiet.

590
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:11,040
Okay, sorry. Daniel Prudhomme. Keep going.

591
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,040
The contractor her guys talked to.

592
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:15,040
He lives in New Orleans.

593
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:20,040
He disappeared right after he was interrogated. Hitched a ride back home to his wife and kids
594
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:24,490
New Orleans is Parasource's home base. They know he's back and their looking for him.

594
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:28,020
- We're going to New Orleans. - Sir, something
else. - Yes?


595
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:30,040
Colonel Morgan was killed.

596
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:33,040
Your prints were found on the murder weapon.

597
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:37,040
I appreciate your help, sergeant.

598
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,020
We need to find Prudhomme before Parasource gets
a hold of him.


599
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,030
There's an airport at Norfolk.

600
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:45,040
- We need credit cards. - And ID's.

601
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:54,040
American Express?
Visa? Discovery?

602
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:58,040
Daddy is so happy with my SAT's and
extracurricular activity.


603
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,030
He's taking us all to New Orleans.

604
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,050
Unless you want me to shut up!

605
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:10,030
You little shit.

606
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:32,030
Sure about this?

607
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:35,040
- No. - Want me to do?

608
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:38,040
No.

609
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:43,020
Tan jacket.

610
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,030
Yeah.

611
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:01,040
- Sorry excuse me. - No problem.

612
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:28,030
Enjoy the flight.

613
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,020
Your seat is in an emergency exit row.

614
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:43,030
[intercom] Please review the responsibilities for
the emergency exit seating ...


615
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:46,040
..on the back of the safety information card
located in the pocket in front of you.


616
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:04,040
Haven't flown before?

617
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:08,030
uh.

618
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:11,020
Here.

619
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,040
- You're kidding. - Don't want you puking on me.

620
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,030
I'm not going to puke.

621
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,040
Good.

622
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:39,040
So, how long have you been in the army for?

623
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:43,030
- oh, 10 years. - Oh wow.

624
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:46,030
- What's your rank? - Major.

625
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:50,020
So, if you give a guy orders?

626
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:53,050
He has to obey? Like fast?

627
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:56,020
Yeah.

628
00:51:56,030 --> 00:52:00,030
And if he tries messing with you, you know like,
all kinds of moves, right?


629
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:03,030
- a few. - that's badass.

630
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:07,020
could I learn some?

631
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:10,020
Sure.

632
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:13,050
- You're not married, right? - No.

633
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:18,020
Are you gay? I'ts totally cool, I know tons of
lesbians.


634
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:19,020
No. I'm not gay.

635
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:21,020
I thought all lady soldiers are gay.

636
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:25,020
Well, some are. Some aren't. Like out in the real
world.


637
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,020
So, is Reacher your boyfriend?

638
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:35,090
No. - Friends with benefits.

639
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,090
- And no. - You mean no, you don't want to.

640
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Or, no he doesn't want to, or no not yet, you
guys haven't really.


641
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Alright, I see how it is.

642
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:53,020
My dad was military.

643
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,020
Really?

644
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:57,010
Never met him.

645
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:00,010
He left before I was born.

646
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Where was he stationed?

647
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:05,020
Around DC, I guess.

648
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:09,000
What was his name?

649
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:16,000
- Candy won't talk about him. - Candy? - My mom.
- Oh.


650
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Just says he was a big hero, and a total asshole.

651
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,010
[intercom] We're beginning our descent so if you
need to use the lavatory you should do it now.


652
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:38,000
I'll be right back.

653
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,020
It's the haircut.

654
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:01,010
All you contractors go to the same barber?

655
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,090
Check it?

656
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:52,090
Oh, he's not feeling well. You might want to use
this one.


657
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:08,000
Go.

658
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,090
Took 2 more of your pieces off the board.

659
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,090
They were the B team.

660
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Who are you, JSOC? SEAL team?

661
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,080
Something like that.

662
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,090
When'd you get back?

663
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:24,080
I'm not sure I ever did.

664
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,080
Don't you miss it?

665
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,010
- Not a bit. - I think you do, drifter.

666
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:33,080
People like us.

667
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
We can never go back to the world.

668
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:38,090
We hurt people.

669
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:41,010
And the people around us get hurt.

670
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:46,090
Leave Turner to me. Walk away now, and I won't
hurt the little girl.


671
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,080
You coming to New Orleans?

672
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:52,080
I'm thinking about it.

673
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:56,080
- Look me up. - I will.

674
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Go! Go!

675
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,080
- Here. - Go, go, go!

676
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Wait! Wait! Wait, wait!

No!

679
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:20,010
Now, you're going to tell me what's going on.

680
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:22,080
Or the first chance I get, I'm going to scream ...

681
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:24,090
or grab a policeman!

682
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:29,000
- Okay, look. - We're protecting you.

683
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:31,090
- I found out that .. - Look you don't ..

684
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:33,090
- Can you stop? - Just ..

685
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:36,090
- Some people were stealing from the government.
- Stealing what?


686
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:40,090
- At this point, the less you know, the better. -
Bullshit!


687
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,090
I got us the credit card, okay? You wouldn't have
even gotten on that plane without it.


688
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:47,010
They're after me too.

689
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,080
Why?

690
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:55,090
You need to tell her.

691
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:09,000
They think you're my daughter.

692
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:10,840
Haha ha

693
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
That's funny.

694
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:20,080
- You're not my father. - How do you know?

695
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:25,090
Well, why would you think you are?

696
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:29,090
Because your mother filed a paternity suit with
the Army claiming I was.


697
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:51,080
All we have available is a lovely 2 bedroom
suite. 350 dollars a night, will that do.


698
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Yes, can I pay with cash?

699
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So are you going to take a DNA test?

700
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Little busy right now.

701
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I got to tell you something.

702
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,080
You're going to get angry.

703
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,090
This whole thing is my fault.

704
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:20,090
How is that?

705
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:25,010
I was the one who made her file the paternity
thing.


706
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:28,000
Thought maybe she could get something out of it.

707
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,090
Money, child support. Help her get her life
together.


708
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:38,090
She's doing better since she got out.

709
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:41,000
Got a job.

710
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Wish she could get a little house.

711
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:54,090
You mad.

712
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,090
You can see it in your face.

713
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:01,000
- I am not mad. - Yes you are.

714
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:04,080
You think I'm your kid so you have to worry about
protecting me.


715
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:08,010
Yeah.

716
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:10,000
- So? - So, I don't want to be here.

717
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,080
So you don't want me here. So I should just leave.

718
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:19,000
Okay. Where are you going to go?

719
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:32,090
Oh my God.

720
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:42,000
Yes, understood. You're messing with me.

721
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,090
- And I just .. food. it's just .. - I'm sorry.

722
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:50,090
- Oh, God. - Thank you.

723
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,090
- Im starving. thanks. - Yes.

724
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:03,000
She's out.

725
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:18,080
Our dinner date.

726
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:22,080
The champagne is still chilling.

727
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:26,080
I knew you we're the romantic type.

728
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:33,080
... sure after those phone calls. What exactly
did you think would happen?


729
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:38,000
I thought, a nice dinner. Maybe some wine.

730
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:47,090
And, ... after dinner?

731
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,090
Back to your place. Right?

732
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:54,090
As opposed to your seedy motel.

733
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:59,000
Never underestimate the charm of a seedy motel.

734
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,010
I could see the appeal.

735
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:08,010
What do you say we look for a seedy motels after
I find Prudhomme?


736
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:10,080
I'll go with you.

737
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:13,090
Only one of us should go.

738
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:16,000
So I'll go.

739
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,090
No, somebody needs to stay here with her.

740
01:02:20,090 --> 01:02:25,000
What? Because I'm a woman? I should be the
babysitter?


741
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:27,080
I don't know how to be the babysitter.

742
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:29,090
- You think that I do? - Yes.

743
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:34,000
You know I have had to put up with this crap my
entire career ..


744
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:37,010
forget the dickheads who think that they can paw
me, it's every male officer.. - hey excuse me, -
who thinks that he's smarter...


745
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:41,080
- hey you've been relieved of command.. - tougher
and more capable than I am. - Hey I was the
commanding.. -And the last I've heard..


746
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,080
- officer here. - you are a fugitive from
military justice. - So are you.


747
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:45,090
So we're both criminals.

748
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I'm going.

749
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:51,090
Its a bad idea Major.

750
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:13,000
thank you.

751
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:15,010
Mrs. Prudhomme.

752
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:21,000
Look. I told you people I don't know where he is.
Okay?


753
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:25,090
- Miss Prudhomme. I'm an MP. - He's done with all
of that.


754
01:03:25,090 --> 01:03:28,000
It's for his own protection.

755
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:31,010
He needs my help.

756
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Yeah, well. He needs all the help he can get...

757
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
- for damn sure. - Does he have any friends?

758
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:42,080
Places? Places he hangs out.

759
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:47,000
Any place there's dope is where?

760
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:50,090
Do you have a photo?

761
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Yeah.

762
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,080
Can burn it for all I care. - [good evening.]

763
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:29,000
You followed me in here.

764
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:31,090
That was a mistake.

765
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:34,090
And you didn't think we were watching the wife.

766
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:37,090
That was a mistake.

767
01:05:37,090 --> 01:05:39,010
Maybe...

768
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:41,090
So how do you want to do this?

769
01:05:41,090 --> 01:05:46,000
How about one at a time? I get a baseball bat.

770
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:50,080
Where's Turner?

771
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:56,010
Really?

772
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:59,010
If you were going to kill me, you would have done
it by now.


773
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:03,090
No we're not going to kill you. Not until you beg
for it.


774
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
And you're going to beg.

775
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:09,080
Left or right?

776
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:12,090
Turner's going to call me in 2 minutes.

777
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
If I don't answer, if I don't pick up.

778
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,080
If I sound distressed, she's in the wind.

779
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:21,090
You're bluffing.

780
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Go for it.

781
01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:31,000
Now tou're wondering how tou're going to make me
talk without tipping her off.


782
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:35,090
You can't torture me. You can't kill me.

783
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
And you're definitely going to have to kill me.

784
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:42,080
Give me the phone... Wait!

785
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:45,000
Toss it over.

786
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:54,080
Fella's...

787
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:34,080
I told you people I don't like being followed.

788
01:07:47,090 --> 01:07:49,090
You're good, Jack!

789
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:51,090
Killing you isn't going to be enough though.

790
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:55,000
So I'm going to take back my promise about not
hurting the little girl.


791
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,090
Never going to happen.

792
01:07:56,090 --> 01:07:58,090
Sure it is.

793
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:03,080
One day, she'll be walking home from school.

794
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:09,090
Or she'll be out on a date, or hanging out with
her friends.


795
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:14,090
And you won't be there to protect her.

796
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:35,080
Okay, let's try it again. This time I want you to
take the gun and hold it lower.


797
01:08:35,090 --> 01:08:39,000
in your chest. Okay you're holding it way too
high. Okay, so grab it, yep bring it low, that's
right now step out and rotate. Right, good.


798
01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:43,000
Hi Reacher.

799
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:46,000
check this out.

800
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:49,000
- Ready? - Yes.

801
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
grab ...

802
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:54,010
- Good. - yeah?

803
01:08:54,010 --> 01:08:56,080
What do you think?

804
01:08:56,080 --> 01:09:01,090
Trust me, If all you have left is that move. Just
assume you're dead already.


805
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,090
That's good. Let's try again...

806
01:09:06,090 --> 01:09:08,090
we're going to add a kick to the balls into it,
okay?


807
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:10,090
Welcome to New Orleans Captain. I'm Lieutenant
Kudrow.


808
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,080
We're here to help any way we can.

809
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,090
What do you have for me?

810
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:17,010
Guys on the plane were ex-military. Hit pretty
bad.


811
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:20,080
- Do we know who they were working for? - They
claim to be unemployed.


812
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,090
Yeah, right.

813
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:26,090
I want their bank records, service records,
foreign travel, gun registrations, car
registration.


814
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,090
how they like their eggs, their favorite flavor
of ice cream. And I want it yesterday.


815
01:09:30,090 --> 01:09:32,090
Sir, Yes Sir!

816
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:42,090
Is she asleep?

817
01:09:49,090 --> 01:09:52,090
I spoke to Prudhomme's wife.

818
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,080
Turns out he's a junkie.

819
01:09:56,090 --> 01:10:00,090
She didn't know where he was.

820
01:10:00,090 --> 01:10:03,000
But she gave me a photo.

821
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:11,080
Are you more upset that I treated you like a
woman?


822
01:10:11,090 --> 01:10:14,010
Or that I treated you like a man?

823
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:17,090
I am upset because I didn't deck you.

824
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I should have been the one to go talk to him. I
can handle myself.


825
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,080
- I would have done better. - Maybe.

826
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,090
I appreciate the apology.

827
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Is it really so important that you make every
decision? - Oh god you're such a dick.


828
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:41,000
Okay, I ...

829
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
I'm used to working alone, okay?

830
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:50,080
I'm used to being alone.

831
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:54,080
- Obviously. - I'm trying to apologize.

832
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:57,090
Well, go on.

833
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:59,080
What do you think we should do?

834
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:04,090
- Don't patronize me, okay? - I'm asking your
opinion.


835
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,000
- Well we could go to the VA. - Which is the
first place ParaSource will look.


836
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,080
- How about the local MP's? - They'll arrest us
in a heartbeat.


837
01:11:10,090 --> 01:11:13,080
Okay, what is your plan then, Reacher?

838
01:11:13,090 --> 01:11:16,010
See you don't know what to do?

839
01:11:16,010 --> 01:11:20,090
You're like something feral, you've got their
scent in your nose and all you want is blood!


840
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:24,010
You still don't get it, do you?

841
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:29,000
They killed my men, took away my job, my life.

842
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,000
I don't want them as bad as you. I want them more.

843
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:13,080
Would you go see if she's up. Should get some
breakfast and figure out the next move.


844
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,010
- What'll we do with the kid? - The kid has a
name.


845
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:21,000
I know that.

846
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,090
- Why are you so tough on her? - It's a hard
world.


847
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:27,090
Sooner she knows it the better.

848
01:12:27,090 --> 01:12:30,080
You don't think she knows that already?

849
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:33,090
Reacher, what if she is yours?

850
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,090
Then I should have been there 15 years ago.

851
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:55,080
Sam? Oh, god

852
01:12:55,090 --> 01:12:58,090
- No, she's not here. - I'll get dressed. - And
go where?


853
01:12:58,090 --> 01:13:00,090
Did she say anything to you?

854
01:13:00,090 --> 01:13:03,090
She said she should leave.

855
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,090
- Whats up? - Where were you?

856
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:14,000
- Out. - Are you crazy?

857
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:16,090
- I was just trying to help. - How were you going
to help, huh?


858
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:19,000
- You guys said Prudhomme's a junkie. - We never
told you.


859
01:13:19,010 --> 01:13:20,080
I heard you guys talking.

860
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:24,090
Some dude on the street said there's a place on
the 9th ward where homeless guys hang out.


861
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:28,090
Some old warehouse. People talk to me. It's a
thing.


862
01:13:28,090 --> 01:13:32,000
- Do you know have any idea how dangerous that
was? - I told you I can take care of myself!


863
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
15 years old. People are looking for you, okay?
They are looking for us.


864
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,080
I just pick out the alpha guy.

865
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:40,000
- And he's supposed to protect you? - No, I give
him shit.


866
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Strong guys don't hurt you. The weak guys do that.

867
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,090
Strong guys always have little sisters or they
want one.


868
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I don't know why, that's just a how it is.

869
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:54,090
I'm really tired.

870
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,090
I can't do this.

871
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,010
That was really stupid.

872
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:18,000
I know.

873
01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:21,080
Please don't ever do that again.

874
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:26,090
Your welcome.

875
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,010
Hey.

876
01:14:52,010 --> 01:14:54,090
Let's go find Prudhomme.

877
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:04,010
[Rehabilitation Centre Opium] - Excuse me sir can
you look at this picture please?


878
01:15:06,090 --> 01:15:09,000
Well folks call it the 9th circle of hell.

879
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,010
- If he's a vet. That's where he's going to be. -
Thank you.


880
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:46,090
I have money for Daniel Prudhomme.

881
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,090
- How much? - More than he needs.

882
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
- well how much? - You know Prudhomme?

883
01:15:57,010 --> 01:16:00,090
- that depends. - It's a simple question.

884
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
What do you want with him?

885
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,090
I told you, I want to give him money.

886
01:16:08,090 --> 01:16:11,010
You are Danny Prudhomme, right?

887
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:18,010
Specialist Daniel Prudhomme.

888
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:24,000
- Yes, I am. - Do you work for ParaSource?

889
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:33,000
The day you spoke to two Seargants, Merkovich and
Cibelli.


890
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
They interviewed you in Bagram.

891
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:41,090
No, I never heard of them.

892
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:48,000
Seargants Merkovich and Cibelli. Merkovich had a
6 year old daughter.


893
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:53,090
Cibelli's wife is pregnant with their first. Now
tell me what happened?


894
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
They'll kill me.

895
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,090
She'll kill you.

896
01:16:58,090 --> 01:17:02,000
No we'll protect you. You have to tell us all of
it.


897
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,000
ParaSource is running truck convoys out of Bagram.

898
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,090
We just ran security for the base. All I had to
do was just lie and say all the weapons were
accounted for.


899
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:20,000
They gave me a shitload of money to keep my mouth
shut.


900
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,000
We're leaving enough shit over there to start
another war.


901
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:29,000
ParaSource was selling off the weapons instead of
bringing them back to the States.


902
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,090
- What went wrong? - Warlords want to renegotiate.

903
01:17:33,090 --> 01:17:37,000
ParaSource says no.

904
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:42,080
The next day, we're driving through those poppy
fields.


905
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,080
- The whole convoy just gets lit up!

906
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:52,000
I was scared shitless.

907
01:17:52,010 --> 01:17:54,090
Army had to send in a search and rescue.

908
01:17:54,090 --> 01:17:58,090
3 search and rescue dudes get wasted on the way.

909
01:18:00,090 --> 01:18:03,090
2 of the dudes I knew.

910
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:09,000
What happened after you gave your statement?

911
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Nothing, I told them everything.

912
01:18:15,010 --> 01:18:20,090
There was this guy he worked for ParaSource, he
told me not to worry.


913
01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:22,090
That he'll take care of everything.

914
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Next thing I know, I hear they'd been killed.

915
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:32,090
I went AWOL ...

916
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,090
hitched a ride back to the States.

917
01:18:37,090 --> 01:18:40,090
I was a dead man if I stayed.

918
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,010
I uh..

919
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:47,090
I started shooting up over there.

920
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:51,090
yjought if I could just get myself home, you know
...


921
01:18:51,090 --> 01:18:55,090
I'd get myself right.

922
01:18:55,090 --> 01:18:57,090
But you didn't.

923
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,090
No.

924
01:19:00,090 --> 01:19:06,010
There's more shit in the streets of New Orleans
than they're making in Afghanistan.


925
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:09,000
Something's wrong.

926
01:19:09,090 --> 01:19:11,090
- Numbers don't add up. - What do you mean?

927
01:19:11,090 --> 01:19:17,010
Why put huge government contracts at risk selling
US Army weapons on the black market?


928
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,080
- ParaSource is smarter than that. - Yeah their
smart alright.


929
01:19:22,010 --> 01:19:26,000
What about our end didn't anybody check to see
the crates are empty?


930
01:19:26,010 --> 01:19:30,000
Probably just some dumb guy like me.

931
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:33,080
We need to get inside one of those transports.

932
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:39,000
A plane leaves Bagram every Friday at 0600 hours.

933
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,080
6 hours to Frankfurt, rest, refuel, 11 more to
get home.


934
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:46,090
Jesus that's 10 o'clock tonight.

935
01:19:56,090 --> 01:19:58,090
[ Back by 9pm ]

936
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:07,000
And that was without the hot sauce.

937
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,090
- haha, now you got to tell me that was worth it,
sir. - oh Hey, hey where you at chief?


938
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:16,000
- ooh You know you're one fine mofellata - No,
no. thank you maam. 


939
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,090
- wait a minute now don't go depriving a poor
girl a taste now. - I don't have no money, I have
no money.


940
01:20:20,090 --> 01:20:22,080
Not today darling. - Okay. - Not today. -  Well
it's his loss now.


941
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:25,000
- Go on now. - Alright.

942
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:28,090
- I have my wallet. - Yeah, I think you're good.

943
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:31,080
Alright, I got my wallet.

944
01:20:33,010 --> 01:20:36,090
- You do it? - Just like we negotiated.

945
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,080
- Well. - It's done.

946
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,080
Make the call.

947
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:53,010
Is that you?

948
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:55,080
No sir, it's not me.

949
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:04,090
Who is this?

950
01:21:04,090 --> 01:21:07,000
I have a witness who can exonerate me.

951
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,090
But he has to live first.

952
01:21:08,090 --> 01:21:11,090
Why don't you, why don't you come in, we'll talk
about it.


953
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,090
Will you guarantee his safety.

954
01:21:13,090 --> 01:21:15,090
You're not in charge anymore, Major.

955
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:19,080
Neither are you apparently, operatives have been
ahead of you this whole time.


956
01:21:19,090 --> 01:21:21,080
Who are those guys on the plane, hm?

957
01:21:21,090 --> 01:21:23,080
They tried to kill me in my cell.

958
01:21:23,090 --> 01:21:26,090
Here's a name for you, Parasource.

959
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,090
Here's a couple more names to think about.

960
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:33,080
Baghdad, Bazra, this isn't our first rodeo is it
Captain.


961
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:35,090
You think I want to be in this position, maam?

962
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:38,000
I have a job to do, and I'm going to do it.

963
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
I'm going to take a leap of faith that you don't
have anything to do with this.


964
01:21:41,010 --> 01:21:44,090
Look on the back of the phone, come alone and
make sure you're not tailed.


965
01:21:54,090 --> 01:21:56,080
Kudrow to Espin.

966
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:59,080
- Kudrow to Espin. - This Espin, go.

967
01:21:59,090 --> 01:22:04,000
We ID'd those boys on the plane. Paid by a shell
company out of the Cayman Islands.


968
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:09,000
- Traced the accounts back to a big military
contractor by the name of.. - Parasource.


969
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,090
Yeah. How'd you know that?

970
01:22:11,090 --> 01:22:16,010
uh uh nevermind, get me everything you can on
Parasource, and I mean everything.


971
01:22:16,010 --> 01:22:18,090
Look I'm enroute to pick up a witnesses.

972
01:22:18,090 --> 01:22:20,000
We'll send backup.

973
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,000
No stand ready 2 minutes out and wait for my
signal.


974
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
That's not procedure, sir.

975
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:30,090
No, that's called an order. Reacher knows the
game, if he smells heat he'll bolt.


976
01:22:30,090 --> 01:22:33,090
Alright we'll stay 2 minutes out. What's the
address?


977
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:36,090
Nicholls Street Wharf. Espin out.

978
01:22:36,090 --> 01:22:40,000
Nicholls Street Wharf.

979
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,010
No witnesses.

980
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:33,090
Freeze!

981
01:23:33,090 --> 01:23:35,090
Don't shoot. Don't shoot man, don't kill me.

982
01:23:35,090 --> 01:23:37,080
Don't kill me. I, I'm, I'm here to help.

983
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:41,010
- You're the witnesses? - Yeah, yes, yeah I'm the
witness.


984
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Where the hell are you?

985
01:23:46,010 --> 01:23:47,000
Youe got what you need?

986
01:23:47,010 --> 01:23:51,000
- Not good enough. - I suggest you listen to what
he has to say.


987
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,090
- I can help. - Okay. Let's go.

988
01:23:56,090 --> 01:23:59,090
I like stories, tell me a story.

989
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,090
We'll return to our Halloween marathon.

990
01:24:05,090 --> 01:24:10,000
Is your costume ready for tonights parade tonight?

991
01:24:57,090 --> 01:25:01,000
- I'm going to call this in. - I'll cover.

992
01:25:03,010 --> 01:25:06,000
Officer down. Nicholls Wharf.

993
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,090
I'm out.

994
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:18,010
- You're still wanted for murder. - That's right,
I'm a stoned killer.


995
01:26:18,010 --> 01:26:20,090
So I saved you.

996
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Did Prudhomme give you a statement?

997
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Most of it.

998
01:26:25,010 --> 01:26:27,090
Cibelli and Mirkovich were your friends.

999
01:26:27,090 --> 01:26:29,000
Thats right.

1000
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,080
Parasource ordered their murders.

1001
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:33,000
They also just tried to kill you.

1002
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
They've been providing insurgents with weapons.

1003
01:26:36,010 --> 01:26:38,090
Well you're going to need more proof than the
word of a dead junkie.


1004
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,080
And you're going to help us get it.

1005
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,090
Here. Put the cuffs on and take us into custody.

1006
01:26:45,090 --> 01:26:49,090
Just get us on yhe TARMAC at Parasource in 1 hour.

1007
01:26:57,080 --> 01:27:01,000
I need you to jump to a conclusion here, soldier.

1008
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,080
Yes. thanks.

1009
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,000
Okay, here's what we got.

1010
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,000
6 months ago, Parasource loses government
contracts worth over a billion dollars.


1011
01:27:12,010 --> 01:27:14,080
They're bleeding cash, and the banks want blood.

1012
01:27:14,090 --> 01:27:18,000
And now, all of a sudden they start paying back
their creditors.


1013
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,010
How much money can they really be making selling
weapons on the black market?


1014
01:27:21,010 --> 01:27:25,090
an M4 is what? 5 grand, a rocket launcher's half
that.


1015
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
That's nothing compared to government contracts.

1016
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:30,090
So where are they getting the money?

1017
01:27:33,090 --> 01:27:36,000
The receptionist, what can we help.

1018
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Hey, do you have room service?

1019
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:43,000
We're sorry we did not serve with cash, we need a
credit card.


1020
01:27:43,010 --> 01:27:46,000
Uh, yes. Wait a minute.

1021
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Do you understand that there will be a parade and
it will take a lot of time.


1022
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,090
Em, it's okay.

1023
01:27:51,090 --> 01:27:54,000
Eh, if a visa is not any?

1024
01:27:59,010 --> 01:28:02,080
Pak we have accurate directions with one stolen
credit card.


1025
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:06,000
Hotel Daphine, 10-18 Royal Road.

1026
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
It was his girl.

1027
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,080
I've warned her.

1028
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
ID's.

1029
01:28:45,010 --> 01:28:48,000
Captain Anthony Espin 110th military police.

1030
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,080
I'm going to have to call this in.

1031
01:28:57,010 --> 01:29:00,080
They're unloading the crates. I got to get in
there.


1032
01:29:12,010 --> 01:29:14,000
Let's drill, Major.

1033
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,090
Drill is to enforce the law.

1034
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,080
Seat belts, please.

1035
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,090
- Turner. - Major.

1036
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:53,090
Hey, this is your last warning.

1037
01:29:53,090 --> 01:29:55,090
Get down!

[PEOPLE SCREAMING]

1039
01:29:56,090 --> 01:29:59,000
Calm down.

1040
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,090
Get down!

1041
01:30:01,090 --> 01:30:04,000
Put 'em down.

1042
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:08,090
Put 'em down, boys.

1043
01:30:08,090 --> 01:30:12,000
Tak 'em down.

1044
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:19,080
What is going on here.

1045
01:30:20,010 --> 01:30:22,000
You in charge of this operation.

1046
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,080
I'm General James Harkness, I run this company.

1047
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:29,090
We have probable cause to believe a crime has
been committed.


1048
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:30,090
And you are.

1049
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,090
Major Susan Turner 110th Military Police.

1050
01:30:34,090 --> 01:30:39,090
The, Major Turner who's wanted by the MP's for
espionage?


1051
01:30:39,090 --> 01:30:42,000
Do you mean these MP's?

1052
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:47,080
This crates are supposed to contain weapons
belonging to the United States Army.


1053
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:50,090
In fact you sold them to insurgents.

1054
01:30:50,090 --> 01:30:53,000
And these are now empty.

1055
01:30:54,090 --> 01:30:58,000
Do you know who I am, Major?

1056
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Yes. General. I do.

1057
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:08,000
You're the man responsible for the deaths of two
of my men.


1058
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,090
Now open up those crates.

1059
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:18,000
Before I grab you by your hairplugs and bitch
slap that smug look off of your face.


1060
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,090
What does the manifest say is in there?

1061
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:28,080
AT-4 rocket launchers, sir.

1062
01:31:29,010 --> 01:31:31,000
Open it.

1063
01:31:33,010 --> 01:31:35,000
Open it.

1064
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,090
Open that one.

1065
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Open it!

1066
01:32:00,090 --> 01:32:02,090
Open it.

1067
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,090
Opening that one.

1068
01:32:11,090 --> 01:32:14,010
I said open up that crate!

1069
01:32:16,010 --> 01:32:18,010
Open it.

1070
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:32,080
Lieutenant, do your goddamn job, and place this
goddamn woman under arrest.


1071
01:32:55,010 --> 01:32:57,000
Sorry Major.

1072
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
You're going to need to come with me.

1073
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,080
You're right.

1074
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:11,000
The numbers don't add up.

1075
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:18,090
Sir, sir.

1076
01:33:18,090 --> 01:33:19,090
Stop that man.

1077
01:33:19,090 --> 01:33:21,090
- Reacher. - Stop that man.

1078
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:25,000
Stop him!

1079
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Take him down, now!

1080
01:33:28,090 --> 01:33:30,090
Breathe deep, son.

1081
01:33:48,090 --> 01:33:50,090
Pure opium.

1082
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Now the numbers add up.

1083
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:08,080
Get him out of here.

1084
01:34:21,010 --> 01:34:22,080
Hello.

1085
01:34:23,010 --> 01:34:28,010
Good evening, I'm looking for a man a woman, and
a little  blond teenager.


1086
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:31,000
Sorry, I can not help you with that kind of thing.

1087
01:34:31,010 --> 01:34:35,000
I'm looking for two adults and a little blonde
girl.


1088
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Find the key.

1089
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,090
Search heroin into custody. It weighs nearly 500
kilos.


1090
01:34:49,010 --> 01:34:50,010
Sam.

1091
01:34:50,010 --> 01:34:53,000
- Reacher, its them, he's here here. - What?

1092
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,080
at the hotel, hurry.

1093
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Sam, listen to me?

1094
01:34:59,010 --> 01:35:00,090
Sam.

1095
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,090
What? Wait! Excuse me!

1096
01:35:39,090 --> 01:35:42,000
Hey, what are you doing?

1097
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,090
Where are you going, come back here!

1098
01:35:56,090 --> 01:35:58,000
She's not answering.

1099
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Try again.

1100
01:36:04,090 --> 01:36:07,010
Car! Car .. Car!

1101
01:36:39,090 --> 01:36:41,090
Sam!

1102
01:36:47,090 --> 01:36:50,010
She's not in the hotel. She's in the street.

1103
01:36:50,010 --> 01:36:52,010
How do you know?

1104
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Because that's what I would do.

1105
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:09,090
I'll go this way.

1106
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:25,090
- Did you see anything? We searched 3 more hote;s
and didn't find a trace of her, nothing. - Then
she's got to be hiding somewhere.


1107
01:37:36,090 --> 01:37:37,090
Reacher.

1108
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,090
Lets finish this. Just you and me.

1109
01:37:40,090 --> 01:37:43,090
I'm going to have some fun with a pretty little
girl.


1110
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,080
She's not my little girl.

1111
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:47,080
Is that fear I hear in your voice, Jack?

1112
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:52,000
I'm going to break your arms, I'm going to break
your legs, I'm going to break your neck.


1113
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,080
What you hear is excitement.

1114
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:58,000
Hey, you! Get out of there! Come on, right now.

1115
01:37:58,090 --> 01:38:03,090
Nice try, Jack. I found a way to hurt you like
you've never hurt before.


1116
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:31,090
Samantha!

1117
01:38:41,090 --> 01:38:42,090
Do you have her?

1118
01:38:42,090 --> 01:38:45,090
Sutter Street, La Fitt hotel.

1119
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:20,080
Sam, run! run!

1120
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,090
Shoot me and I let go.

1121
01:41:51,090 --> 01:41:54,090
Shoot me. Shoot me, Jack!

1122
01:41:54,090 --> 01:41:58,000
Well, shoot me!

1123
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,010
ParaSource is done.

1124
01:42:00,010 --> 01:42:02,000
Harkness is in custody.

1125
01:42:02,010 --> 01:42:04,010
Congratulations, Jack.

1126
01:42:04,010 --> 01:42:07,080
I really, I don't give a shit.

1127
01:42:07,090 --> 01:42:09,000
Shut up!

1128
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,010
Shut up!

1129
01:42:11,090 --> 01:42:14,010
I told you, this would happen.

1130
01:42:14,090 --> 01:42:17,080
You said this about you and me?

1131
01:42:17,090 --> 01:42:21,000
Put the gun down.

1132
01:42:23,090 --> 01:42:27,010
Okay, okay.

1133
01:42:27,090 --> 01:42:29,010
Okay.

1134
01:42:29,010 --> 01:42:33,000
If I put down the gun, you let her go.

1135
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
My life for hers.

1136
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
No!

1137
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
I like it.

1138
01:42:44,010 --> 01:42:46,000
Deal Jack.

1139
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,090
It's okay Sam, look at me.

1140
01:42:48,090 --> 01:42:50,000
It's okay.

1141
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,080
It's the only way.

1142
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:55,090
It's okay.

1143
01:42:55,090 --> 01:42:57,080
Now I'm going to put the gun down now.

1144
01:42:57,090 --> 01:42:59,090
Okay.

1145
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:09,000
You know what this means?

1146
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,080
It means we're dead already.

1147
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Over here.

1148
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,080
Kick it over here.

1149
01:45:21,010 --> 01:45:23,090
Look at me.

1150
01:45:24,090 --> 01:45:27,000
You look at me!

1151
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,080
Hey!

1152
01:45:51,090 --> 01:45:53,010
- Is he okay? - Yes, I think so.

1153
01:45:53,010 --> 01:45:55,010
I want you to look here.

1154
01:45:57,090 --> 01:45:59,080
I'm right here.

1155
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,010
Can you walk?

1156
01:46:10,090 --> 01:46:13,000
Sure.

1157
01:46:15,090 --> 01:46:18,000
Take it easy.

1158
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,090
Okay.

1159
01:46:22,010 --> 01:46:25,090
- Dude, you jumped off a building. - Yes I know.

1160
01:46:25,090 --> 01:46:28,000
- Does that hurts? - Yes.

1161
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:33,090
- Did you see how high it was? - Can we possibly
have this conversation some other time?


1162
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:16,090
Thank you.

1163
01:47:18,090 --> 01:47:25,090
You know, it's funny. You came looking for one
girl and you ended up with another.


1164
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:30,090
Let me know how that goes.

1165
01:47:33,090 --> 01:47:36,090
I still got your number.

1166
01:47:41,090 --> 01:47:43,000
Bye, Reacher.

1167
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Major.

1168
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:08,000
Good to see you back, Major.

1169
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:11,080
Thank you, Captain.

1170
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,010
Sorry. Bus got stuck in traffic.

1171
01:48:41,010 --> 01:48:43,000
New T-shirt.

1172
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Shut up.

1173
01:48:45,010 --> 01:48:47,080
Thanks for coming.

1174
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:53,000
So, Reacher ..

1175
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Are you my father or not?

1176
01:48:57,010 --> 01:49:00,010
I guess we'll see when your mother gets here.

1177
01:49:00,010 --> 01:49:03,000
Sure you'd recognize her.

1178
01:49:03,090 --> 01:49:07,010
I tend to remember the women that I sleep with.

1179
01:49:07,010 --> 01:49:11,000
- who says she'll remember you. - Thanks a lot.

1180
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,090
You're not my father.

1181
01:49:19,090 --> 01:49:22,000
Why do you say that?

1182
01:49:24,090 --> 01:49:27,080
See that woman over there?

1183
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:32,000
The waitress who's refilled your coffee three
times.


1184
01:49:34,010 --> 01:49:36,090
That's her.

1185
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:41,000
You never had any idea who ??? was.

1186
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,090
I knew it all along.

1187
01:49:48,090 --> 01:49:50,000
No, you didn't.

1188
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,090
I'm sure you're relieved.

1189
01:49:54,090 --> 01:49:57,010
Not really.

1190
01:50:07,010 --> 01:50:10,000
Just going to go.

1191
01:50:10,090 --> 01:50:12,090
Thats right.

1192
01:50:14,090 --> 01:50:17,090
Don't you ever get lonely?

1193
01:50:20,090 --> 01:50:23,000
Sometimes.

1194
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,080
Sometimes.

1195
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:35,080
You can call me when you do.

1196
01:50:49,010 --> 01:50:51,090
So..

1197
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Shouldn't you be?

1198
01:50:59,090 --> 01:51:02,080
I'd better go.

1199
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,010
I have got class.

1200
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:09,090
Drawing.

1201
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:18,090
You keep that up because, you're really good at
it.


1202
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
You're really good.

1203
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:36,000
You're gona be okay kid.

1204
01:51:42,090 --> 01:51:44,090
Well ..

1205
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:31,080
See you around, Reacher.
