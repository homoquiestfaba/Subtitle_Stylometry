1
00:00:02,999 --> 00:00:05,998
<i>Oh, shh, baby.
You're okay.</i>

2
00:00:05,999 --> 00:00:09,998
<i>This is Mitchell,
and this is Summer.</i>

3
00:00:09,999 --> 00:00:11,998
<i>Welcome to the world, guys.</i>

4
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:12,999
<i>Oh, big yawn.</i>

5
00:00:17,999 --> 00:00:19,998
<i>What's it like
being a mom?</i>

6
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:20,999
<i>It's exhausting!</i>

7
00:00:27,876 --> 00:00:30,333
<i>That's it! You can do it.
Come on over.</i>

8
00:00:30,334 --> 00:00:32,999
<i>You're doing it!
Come on, come to Mama.</i>

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,876
<i>That's one small step
for man.</i>

10
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,167
<i>Shh!</i>

11
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:49,999
<i>Where's Mitchell?
Like a little goat.</i>

12
00:00:55,999 --> 00:00:58,999
<i>Can't stay mad at me.
I'm adorable.</i>

13
00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:02,333
<i>You're grounded.</i>

14
00:01:02,334 --> 00:01:03,998
<i>It's going to get
caught up in it</i>

15
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:06,167
<i>and fly away.</i>

16
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:30,999
<i>Mitchell, don't go too far.</i>

17
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:11,998
<i>Mitchell!
Where is he?</i>

18
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:13,875
<i>Mitchell!</i>

19
00:02:13,876 --> 00:02:14,998
<i>Excuse me,
have you seen a little boy?</i>

20
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:15,998
<i>He's wearing
blue swim trunks.</i>

21
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:16,998
<i>He was just here.</i>

22
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:18,998
<i>Scaredy cat.</i>

23
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:20,167
<i>Mitchell!</i>

24
00:02:28,334 --> 00:02:29,999
<i>Mitchell!</i>

25
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:33,999
<i>Mitchell!</i>

26
00:02:56,999 --> 00:02:59,998
<i>I should never have let her
walk to the park by herself.</i>

27
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:02,875
<i>She's only 9.
I should have been with her.</i>

28
00:03:02,876 --> 00:03:04,998
I'm very confident
that we're going to find her.

29
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:07,708
You've done
everything right.

30
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:08,998
- I should've been...
- Dan...

31
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:10,998
I know what
you're going through,

32
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:14,998
and I know you're scared.

33
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:17,333
I can't even remember
what she was wearing.

34
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:19,998
This wasn't your fault.

35
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,998
Olivia needs you
to be strong for her,

36
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:23,998
no matter where she is.

37
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:26,998
<i>You need to have hope.</i>

38
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,333
How do you have hope?

39
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:31,999
After all this time...
with your son?

40
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:38,998
Every day I don't get bad news
is a day I can still find him.

41
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:40,999
Hope is all we have.

42
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:46,166
Caffeine, caffeine,
caffeine.

43
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:47,999
I don't know
how you do it.

44
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:51,998
They found her--
That's how.

45
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:54,998
Ex-wife's sister-in-law,
happily ever after,

46
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:58,998
and you get to leave
on a high note.

47
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:00,998
Not fair!

48
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:03,998
Come on.
You're my last volunteer.

49
00:04:03,999 --> 00:04:05,999
I can't do it.
I just can't do it anymore.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,998
It's too...

51
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:09,999
What about today?
Today was great!

52
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:15,875
Look, you do so much
for these families, okay?

53
00:04:15,876 --> 00:04:19,998
You-- the handholding, the
interviews, the legislation.

54
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:24,166
Nobody is going to think twice
if you said you needed a break.

55
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:25,998
- I don't need a break.
- Go out with me.

56
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:29,166
What? Wha--

57
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:32,998
Yeah, now that we're not
working together, you know,

58
00:04:32,999 --> 00:04:34,998
there's no
conflict of interest.

59
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:37,998
I don't have time.

60
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:42,875
Enjoying yourself for five minutes?
You deserve that.

61
00:04:42,876 --> 00:04:45,998
You tell other parents of missing
children the same thing,

62
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:50,166
so I'm just asking you
to listen to your own advice.

63
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:51,999
I can't hear me.

64
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,998
I should take this.

65
00:04:57,999 --> 00:05:00,999
I didn't hear a "No."
I did not hear a "No."

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,998
I'm going to call you.

67
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:05,709
We're going to do this.

68
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:10,998
This is Laura Harris.

69
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:12,708
<i>Hello, Mrs. Harris?</i>

70
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:14,999
<i>This is Dr. Paul
from the coroner's office.</i>

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,998
<i>We found a body.</i>

72
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:19,998
She played a pumpkin
in this very play.

73
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,998
And mom didn't show up
to that one either.

74
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:23,500
Well, I liked the play.

75
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:24,998
Aw, of course
you did, Amanda.

76
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:28,998
Greg.
Your cell was off.

77
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:30,998
Yeah, they don't like it
ringing during the play, so...

78
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:33,500
Mom, so good of you
to show up.

79
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:35,998
- Something happened.
- What happened?

80
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:37,998
- Hi, Laura.
- I'm sorry. Hi, Amanda.

81
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:38,998
Wasn't it nice of Amanda

82
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:40,998
to leave work early and come
because she cares?

83
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:42,998
It's something
that people do when they...

84
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:43,998
Okay, okay,
okay, okay.

85
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:45,500
Look, Jonathan
hasn't come out yet.

86
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:47,501
Let's just pretend
you were here.

87
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:50,999
- Dad, Amanda!
- Johnny!

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,166
Hey, hey!

89
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:54,998
- You were great!
- Fantastic!

90
00:05:54,999 --> 00:05:57,998
You did not suck actually.

91
00:05:57,999 --> 00:06:00,999
- Hi, honey.
- You didn't even see it.

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,998
<i>Oh, come on now.</i>

93
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:04,333
We're going out
for ice cream, right?

94
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:05,998
Something came up.
It was about Mitchell.

95
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,998
- Oh, shocker.
- You know what?

96
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:09,759
Why don't we go say good-bye
to your teacher.

97
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:14,500
I actually came
to get you, Greg.

98
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:15,998
- They found a body.
<i>- Another one?</i>

99
00:06:15,999 --> 00:06:17,998
Can it wait
until after ice cream?

100
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:19,500
Yeah, it can wait.

101
00:06:19,501 --> 00:06:20,998
I mean, he's not going to get
any deader, right?

102
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:22,998
Summer, don't push it.

103
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:25,875
You know, I really hope it's him this time.
I actually do.

104
00:06:25,876 --> 00:06:26,998
You don't mean that.

105
00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:28,166
Mom, you have no idea
what I mean

106
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:29,998
because all you care about
is him.

107
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:30,998
Cut it out, Summer.

108
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:31,999
People are staring.

109
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:37,166
I'll go alone.

110
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:38,999
Laura, just wait.

111
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:41,998
I'll see you back at home.

112
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:42,998
<i>Okay.</i>

113
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:44,998
But you promised ice cream.

114
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:46,998
We'll still get ice cream.
We'll see you later.

115
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:48,876
We're still going
to get ice cream.

116
00:06:54,876 --> 00:06:55,998
The body
was found in a shed

117
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,999
behind a house a couple got
in a foreclosure deal.

118
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:02,998
It's tough
when they're young like that.

119
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:04,500
State of decomposition
indicates

120
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:06,000
he's been dead
about 10 days.

121
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:11,875
Mr. Harris, maybe you'd prefer
if your wife waited out here.

122
00:07:11,876 --> 00:07:12,998
Ex-wife.

123
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,999
Not officially.
I'd like to see him.

124
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:28,875
It's not him.

125
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:29,998
You sure?

126
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:30,998
Yes.

127
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:33,998
Our son had a birthmark
under his left shoulder.

128
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:35,319
Can you show us
the left shoulder?

129
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,998
I knew it.

130
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:45,999
Oh, thank God!
Thank you.

131
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:52,000
Sorry to put you through this.
I'm glad for you.

132
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:54,999
Let's go.

133
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:02,999
Just give me a minute.

134
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:30,998
What?

135
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:33,500
You know,
if that had been Mitchell,

136
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:34,998
we'd have closure.

137
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:36,998
Don't say that.

138
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:40,500
Eleven years, Laura. I loved
Mitchell as much as you did.

139
00:08:40,501 --> 00:08:42,999
I think about him every day,
but 11 years.

140
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,998
So that's the deadline?
We just give up?

141
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:48,998
The likelihood that we're going to
find him is what, one in a million?

142
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:53,998
But that's something! That's a chance.
We have to believe...

143
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:55,999
Laura, please don't give me this
speech anymore. It's not hope.

144
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,998
<i>It's delusion and living
in this impossibility.</i>

145
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:01,998
<i>It's like we're being
held hostage by it.</i>

146
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,999
I can still
hear his laugh, Greg.

147
00:09:06,999 --> 00:09:08,998
Feel the way his little hand
used to squeeze mine

148
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:10,501
when he was going to sleep.

149
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:13,999
I don't remember
any of that anymore.

150
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:19,998
I understand
if you need to move on,

151
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:22,998
but if there's a chance
that he's still alive,

152
00:09:22,999 --> 00:09:25,998
I can't.

153
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:26,999
I'm his mom.

154
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:34,998
Miranda's pregnant...

155
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:38,998
and I'd like to finalize
our divorce and get married.

156
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:40,500
I think
we should sell the house.

157
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:41,998
No, that's impossible.

158
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,998
- Laura, it's time.
- If he comes home...

159
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:45,709
It's time.

160
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:53,998
Oh, my God!

161
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:56,079
My brother is the most grotesque
person on the planet.

162
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:01,998
Oh, help, save me!
Save my ice cream!

163
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:02,998
Jonathan.

164
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:07,998
Oh, back from the dead.
Do you want to identify him?

165
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,998
- Summer, off the phone, now.
- I gotta go.

166
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:11,998
Oh, God!
It was him?

167
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:14,998
No, let me guess--
Wrong hair, wrong color.

168
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:16,998
We even had
the wrong sex once.

169
00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:18,998
- It wasn't him.
- I told you!

170
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:20,709
Okay, fine.
I'm going to my room.

171
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:25,998
All right, Jonathan.
Come here.

172
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:27,998
Listen.

173
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:30,998
I'm really, really sorry
about missing your play, okay,

174
00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:33,998
and I promise
I'm going to make it up to you.

175
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:36,998
It's okay, Mommy.
I know.

176
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:37,999
Sorry you lost Mitchell.

177
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:47,998
Okay. Come on.
Oh, you're so big.

178
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:50,998
<i>Do not pass
without your ice cream.</i>

179
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:53,998
Here you go.

180
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:56,500
There's uh, there's
more ice cream if you want.

181
00:10:56,501 --> 00:10:58,999
- I should go talk to her.
- No, I will.

182
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:04,998
So, he told me.

183
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:07,998
Ah! Great.

184
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:10,998
They don't make
e-cards for this.

185
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:12,998
I congratulate you
for your impending wedding

186
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:15,998
to my impending ex-husband.

187
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:17,500
I know. Divorce
in the new millennium

188
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:18,999
is so civilized.

189
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,998
And then
I congratulate you

190
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:21,998
on whether
it's a boy or a girl,

191
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:23,998
and oooh and ahhh
at your ring.

192
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:27,998
- It's a girl. No ring yet.
- Girls are good.

193
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:29,998
<i>It's not fair.
You can't ground me!</i>

194
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:31,998
<i>- I already did.
- It's not my fault.</i>

195
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:33,708
<i>My mother
is completely insane!</i>

196
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:35,998
Girls are good
some of the time.

197
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:36,999
Here you go.

198
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,999
<i>Hey, kid.</i>

199
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:57,999
<i>Working?</i>

200
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:00,999
<i>Come on in.</i>

201
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:25,999
<i>Hi, Laura's voicemail.</i>

202
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,999
<i>My name is Kyle.
I'm handsome and single,</i>

203
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,998
<i>and a really great
conversationalist,</i>

204
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:34,998
<i>and if I don't sound like
too much of a jerk,</i>

205
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:37,998
<i>and you want to try maybe
going out with me</i>

206
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:41,999
<i>on a date sometime,
I'd really like that.</i>

207
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:05,999
Hi. I'm Laura Harris
from the Mitchell Harris Center.

208
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:09,998
It's almost impossible
to imagine

209
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:11,998
that every 40 seconds
in the United States,

210
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:12,999
a child goes missing.

211
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:19,501
Hard to imagine unless
it's happened to you.

212
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:24,998
I want to thank everyone
who works so hard

213
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:28,999
to give our kids
a safe place to play.

214
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,998
So on behalf
of Mitchell Harris Center

215
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:36,500
and our son,

216
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,999
I hereby dedicate
Mitchell Park.

217
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:44,998
I always just give out
my number to anyone...

218
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:46,998
No, you don't.
This is not a common thing.

219
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:50,998
No, this is rare.
So you should be really...

220
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:53,998
Hey. Sorry to steal her,
but we're going to be off

221
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:55,998
to have some
mother and daughter time.

222
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,999
You'll call.

223
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:00,999
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

224
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:04,998
He's a little old for you,
isn't he?

225
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:07,708
I have no idea
how old he is, Mom.

226
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:09,998
It doesn't look like
he goes to your school.

227
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:11,998
- He doesn't go to my school.
- Then how did you meet him?

228
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:13,998
I just met him here,
at your event.

229
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:16,500
You just met him and
you gave him your phone number?

230
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:18,708
You gave... Honey, I--

231
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,708
It's not-- it's not
like he's a predator.

232
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:23,998
How do you know...
You don't know that!

233
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:25,998
- He's a nice guy.
- I mean...

234
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:27,999
<i>Unbelievable...</i>

235
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:37,998
So, uh, where do you
want to go for lunch?

236
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:42,998
- I have a total of 68 cents.
- Luckily.

237
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:45,998
Man, I love your mother.

238
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:49,999
<i>She'd never make you go to
an absurd playground dedication</i>

239
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,166
and nobody cares about it
except for toddlers

240
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:54,998
and helicopter parents.

241
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:58,999
I'm absolutely set on Saturday
except for Stuart.

242
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,998
Hello?

243
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:03,875
Oh, okay.
Who's Stuart?

244
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:05,999
Just an incredibly sexy
new way to annoy my mother.

245
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:09,998
You know what,
I'll meet you out front.

246
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:11,998
I've gotta grab my car keys.

247
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:12,998
Okay.

248
00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:13,999
Okay.

249
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,999
She looks familiar.

250
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,998
You don't.

251
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:25,999
I'm new.

252
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,998
I'm Beth.

253
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:29,500
She's...?

254
00:16:29,501 --> 00:16:30,998
I thought
you were looking at me.

255
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:33,998
- I was.
- Hmmm.

256
00:16:33,999 --> 00:16:38,708
Tell me her name, and then I'll
focus my attention on you.

257
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:40,998
Summer.

258
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:41,999
Summer.

259
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:46,334
Hi, Beth.

260
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:56,998
I don't know. I thought
it would be more casual

261
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:59,998
to have you over here
instead of going out.

262
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:02,998
But now I don't know.

263
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:05,999
No, it's fine.
I'm sorry.

264
00:17:08,999 --> 00:17:10,998
I don't know why
this is so awkward.

265
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:11,999
I don't either.

266
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,998
I mean,
we've hung out a lot.

267
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:19,166
I guess before, it was
always about Mitchell...

268
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:22,998
and now it's about you.

269
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:23,999
And you.

270
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,999
Get to work!

271
00:19:00,999 --> 00:19:03,999
You startled me.
Can I help you?

272
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:13,999
Are you okay?

273
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:26,999
Wait! Wait.

274
00:19:33,876 --> 00:19:34,876
Mom?

275
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:56,999
Oh!
Oh!

276
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:08,709
Oh, my God, you're here!
You're here!

277
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:11,999
Oh!

278
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:16,999
I saw the poster.

279
00:20:18,334 --> 00:20:20,998
You did!

280
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:22,998
Oh!

281
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:24,998
Oh, God!

282
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:26,999
Oh, God!

283
00:20:43,334 --> 00:20:44,999
Am I doing something wrong?

284
00:20:46,334 --> 00:20:49,998
No.

285
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,998
It's just...

286
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:54,999
You still really like
those crackers.

287
00:20:57,334 --> 00:21:00,998
Is that why
you're staring at me?

288
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:03,999
Where were you?

289
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:14,998
- I can't tell you.
- Of course you can.

290
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:18,334
It's over.
You're safe now.

291
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:29,998
You don't know
what you'll think of me.

292
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:32,501
I'll think whatever happened
to you wasn't your fault.

293
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,334
You can tell me.

294
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:40,333
Mitchell,
where are you going?

295
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:41,998
I need to leave.

296
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:45,998
No, no, no, no.
Please, I'm sorry, okay?

297
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:47,998
I won't push you.

298
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:49,998
You don't have to
tell me anything.

299
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:51,999
Just stay.

300
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:57,999
- You sure?
- Yeah.

301
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:02,333
Okay.

302
00:22:02,334 --> 00:22:04,501
Maybe we should
call your dad.

303
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:08,999
Yeah.

304
00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:12,998
Even in these clothes?

305
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,998
Yeah.

306
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:17,999
This is how
I always pictured it.

307
00:22:22,334 --> 00:22:24,501
You still live
in our home, right?

308
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:27,999
Yeah.

309
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:32,709
Take me home.

310
00:22:51,999 --> 00:22:53,999
I remember this.

311
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,999
I remember this!

312
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:20,333
Look at this.

313
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:22,500
Do you remember?

314
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,999
Grandma gave us this mirror
when you and Summer were born.

315
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:29,333
Yeah. The reflection.

316
00:23:29,334 --> 00:23:31,334
We look right, don't we?

317
00:23:32,999 --> 00:23:34,999
We do.

318
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:41,998
I can't wait to see the rest
of the family-- dad, Summer.

319
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:44,166
I bet she's beautiful now,
isn't she?

320
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:47,500
- Yes, she is.
- Is she home?

321
00:23:47,501 --> 00:23:49,998
We don't live together
anymore.

322
00:23:49,999 --> 00:23:51,999
Summer lives with your dad.

323
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,999
And you have
a little brother.

324
00:23:57,999 --> 00:24:00,998
Is his name Mitchell, too?

325
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:03,998
Oh, no!
His name is Jonathan.

326
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:05,998
Okay.

327
00:24:05,999 --> 00:24:09,998
He's 8 years old,
and he loves old movies,

328
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:14,998
and he won't eat fruit
and he hates swimming,

329
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:18,998
and he always wanted to know
his big brother.

330
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:23,998
Listen, there's going to
be a lot of changes,

331
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:26,998
but there's one constant,

332
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:29,998
and that constant is me.

333
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:34,999
- Okay?
- Okay, yeah.

334
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:44,000
Mitchell?

335
00:25:06,999 --> 00:25:07,999
Dad.

336
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:13,999
<i>Jonathan, maybe not now.</i>

337
00:25:14,999 --> 00:25:16,999
It's okay.

338
00:25:18,999 --> 00:25:20,998
This is Amanda.

339
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:21,999
Hi.

340
00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:24,999
Hi.

341
00:25:28,876 --> 00:25:29,999
Summer...

342
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:44,000
<i>This is Jonathan.</i>

343
00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:50,998
Jonathan, this is
your big brother Mitchell.

344
00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:52,999
Mom told me a lot about you.

345
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:58,333
Did she tell you about me?

346
00:25:58,334 --> 00:25:59,709
Every day.

347
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:07,998
That's a really cool camera.

348
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,999
Yeah.
Shoots real film.

349
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,999
It's like old school.
Can I see it?

350
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:55,875
It's like a time capsule.

351
00:26:55,876 --> 00:26:56,998
People always wanted me
to pack up everything

352
00:26:56,999 --> 00:27:00,998
and give it away
and I couldn't.

353
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:02,998
We can redecorate of course.

354
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:04,999
It's okay.

355
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:10,999
You really wanted me
to come back.

356
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,875
No.

357
00:27:13,876 --> 00:27:15,501
I knew you were
going to come home.

358
00:27:39,999 --> 00:27:41,998
What about this?

359
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:44,999
Do you uh,
do you remember this?

360
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,998
It's my kite.

361
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:51,999
That's the one you were flying
the day you were taken.

362
00:27:53,999 --> 00:27:56,998
I made this.

363
00:27:56,999 --> 00:27:59,998
Where have you been?
Who took you?

364
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:02,333
Right now it doesn't matter
where he's been.

365
00:28:02,334 --> 00:28:05,998
I can't see how
it doesn't matter right now.

366
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:07,999
Who, who did this?
Tell me who it was.

367
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:10,998
<i>Greg. Greg.</i>

368
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:13,998
Tell me who it was.
I'll find him.

369
00:28:13,999 --> 00:28:14,998
I'll find them...

370
00:28:14,999 --> 00:28:16,999
Greg!

371
00:28:17,999 --> 00:28:19,998
I'm sorry.

372
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:24,500
No, you have nothing
to be sorry about.

373
00:28:24,501 --> 00:28:26,000
He's not ready
to talk right now.

374
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,998
I don't want any.

375
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:38,999
You need to eat
some vegetables.

376
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,998
You can't survive on
bread and cheese alone.

377
00:28:40,999 --> 00:28:41,998
I'm not hungry.

378
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:44,999
Just eat it!
Give me the damn camera.

379
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:53,998
Okay, Jonathan, buddy.
I'm sorry, okay?

380
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,998
You know what,
Jonathan's right.

381
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:57,998
This is worth
commemorating.

382
00:28:57,999 --> 00:28:59,998
I mean,
it's a special occasion.

383
00:28:59,999 --> 00:29:00,998
We should take a picture.

384
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:02,998
- All right.
- Here.

385
00:29:02,999 --> 00:29:04,998
Oh, yeah sure.
I'll take it.

386
00:29:04,999 --> 00:29:05,999
Come on, Summer.

387
00:29:08,876 --> 00:29:12,998
All right. Okay.
Say "cheese" everyone.

388
00:29:12,999 --> 00:29:15,998
Cheese!

389
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:17,999
- That's for you.
- Thanks.

390
00:29:19,999 --> 00:29:22,998
I'm going to have to get
more food in the house

391
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:24,159
now that you're staying here.

392
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:28,998
You really
want me to stay?

393
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:30,998
Of course!

394
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:32,998
I think we can just take
a little bit of time.

395
00:29:32,999 --> 00:29:34,998
There's already been
enough time.

396
00:29:34,999 --> 00:29:35,998
We can ease into it,

397
00:29:35,999 --> 00:29:37,998
get to know each other
a little bit more.

398
00:29:37,999 --> 00:29:39,998
That may not be
the worst idea.

399
00:29:39,999 --> 00:29:42,998
Isn't there a protocol
we have to follow?

400
00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:44,998
A therapist to talk to?

401
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:46,999
You don't even know
if he's really...

402
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:50,998
You don't know
if he's really interested

403
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:53,998
in having a parent-child
home situation.

404
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:54,998
Do you know what I mean?

405
00:29:54,999 --> 00:29:56,875
Yeah, I know
what you mean, Amanda.

406
00:29:56,876 --> 00:29:58,998
Look, Laura, I'm sorry,

407
00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:01,166
but there are ways to prove...

408
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:03,875
I'll take the test.

409
00:30:03,876 --> 00:30:06,998
I don't need a test!
God, you're a piece of work.

410
00:30:06,999 --> 00:30:08,559
Okay. We're getting
a little tense here.

411
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,275
I didn't mean
anything by it, okay.

412
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:12,949
It's just a way to be sure.

413
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:15,826
Mitchell, for you, too--
Just to know that they're...

414
00:30:15,827 --> 00:30:17,826
You don't need to be sure,
Amanda.

415
00:30:17,827 --> 00:30:20,949
We're sure.
You didn't know him before.

416
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:24,949
We know he's our son.
We know.

417
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:25,950
Greg?

418
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,950
<i>Does he have the
birthmark on his shoulder?</i>

419
00:30:31,827 --> 00:30:32,951
Did you even check?

420
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:38,949
You, of all people,
I'd thought you know me.

421
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:39,950
Sorry.

422
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:44,949
You don't have to do this.

423
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,950
No, it's okay.

424
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:55,951
I did.
I covered it up.

425
00:30:58,951 --> 00:31:01,949
You don't have
anything to prove.

426
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:06,451
It's fine.
I'll take the DNA test...

427
00:31:06,452 --> 00:31:07,950
if that's what
you want me to do.

428
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:30,949
<i>Mom!</i>

429
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,950
<i>Mom!</i>

430
00:31:32,951 --> 00:31:35,951
<i>Mom! Mom!</i>

431
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:42,949
Mitchell! Mitchell!

432
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,949
You're having a nightmare.

433
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:49,950
You're okay.
You're okay now.

434
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:36,951
Hello.
Wait, who is this?

435
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,950
What picture?

436
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:45,949
What's on your mind
right now?

437
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:48,451
I'm just happy to be home.

438
00:32:48,452 --> 00:32:51,284
What do you want to say to the
people who stole your childhood?

439
00:32:51,285 --> 00:32:53,949
Did you post that picture
online?

440
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,826
Mrs. Harris, do you think

441
00:32:55,827 --> 00:32:57,949
your son will ever
be the same again?

442
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,826
What's happening here?

443
00:33:00,827 --> 00:33:03,949
What does it feel like
to be back home?

444
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,950
You'll have to excuse us.
Come on in.

445
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:12,118
Can I just get one question?

446
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,950
How did they get
that photo?

447
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:27,949
I'm sorry. I don't want
to cause any trouble.

448
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:30,660
I want people to know
I'm back.

449
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,949
Of course.

450
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,659
I want people
to know about you.

451
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,949
But everyone's
going to have questions.

452
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,949
It's just I--

453
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,949
I just thought
that it would make it real.

454
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:47,659
It's real because
I know it's real,

455
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,949
but there's a process to this,

456
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,950
and we're going to have
to see a family therapist.

457
00:33:51,951 --> 00:33:55,826
This is going to be
a whole journey.

458
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:56,951
There's no reason
to rush it.

459
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,949
<i>There's really
nothing more to say.</i>

460
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,949
This has been a long nightmare,
it's finally come to an end,

461
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:10,949
and our family really needs time
to rebuild and to heal.

462
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:14,284
So I'm asking you all
for your privacy at this time.

463
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:16,949
That's all.

464
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:18,660
Just one interview?

465
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:30,949
God, when are they
going to leave?

466
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:33,949
Eventually.

467
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:35,949
Hey, you look great.

468
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:38,284
Listen, if you don't like anything,
we can always return it.

469
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:40,117
No, they're perfect.
Thank you.

470
00:34:40,118 --> 00:34:42,949
It was Mitchell's idea
to bring Jonathan along--

471
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,826
Make a boys' day out of it.

472
00:34:44,827 --> 00:34:46,659
Special occasion.

473
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,949
Yeah, it's not every day
you get a father-son blood test.

474
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,949
It's just a formality.

475
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:52,949
You guys have fun
or have fun after the test.

476
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:55,949
Bye, honey.

477
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:58,451
So what do you think, guys,
a movie, batting cages?

478
00:34:58,452 --> 00:35:00,949
- Why don't we go to the lake?
- No, batting cages.

479
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:01,950
He's not
the strongest swimmer.

480
00:35:01,951 --> 00:35:03,949
- Dad.
- Well, you could be.

481
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:06,949
- I don't like the water.
- I get it.

482
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:11,284
It's deep, big, dark.

483
00:35:11,285 --> 00:35:13,949
You never know what's lurking
beneath the water, right?

484
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,949
It could just grab you.

485
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,949
I'm kidding.
I'm sorry.

486
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,950
The lake stopped being
a happy place a long time ago.

487
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:26,659
If you think water's scary,

488
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,949
there's plenty of things
in the world

489
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:28,950
that are much scarier.

490
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,949
<i>Mitchell and Greg Harris?</i>

491
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:36,950
Right here.
Got our paperwork.

492
00:35:59,118 --> 00:36:00,949
- Don't tell me!
- What?

493
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,950
Can't find my phone.

494
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:07,949
I think I saw it
in the car.

495
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,659
All right.
I'm going to take a look.

496
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,660
I'll be right back.

497
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:16,950
What are you doing?

498
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,950
Give me your arm.

499
00:36:29,827 --> 00:36:30,949
- Ouch!
- Shh!

500
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:33,949
Okay, for us--
Blood brothers.

501
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,949
It makes it official.

502
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:38,950
No one can ever
tear us apart.

503
00:36:38,951 --> 00:36:42,949
- Ow!
- Stop, okay?

504
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,117
Mom is finally happy.

505
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:47,949
You wouldn't want to
ruin that, would you?

506
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:50,827
Okay. Don't move.

507
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,950
<i>- Mitchell Harris?
</i>- Yes.

508
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,949
- Open.
- What's that?

509
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,452
Open.

510
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,949
This is so weird.
I just had it.

511
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:12,949
Must have left it at home.

512
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:15,949
- You're the father?
- Yes. Hi.

513
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:18,950
Hi. Open wide.

514
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:23,660
That was easy.

515
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,660
Here you go, sweetie.

516
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,950
Can I get one?

517
00:37:34,951 --> 00:37:37,451
So are we all good?

518
00:37:37,452 --> 00:37:39,659
Results will be mailed in
three to five business days.

519
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,949
Great.
Could you send the results

520
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,950
to my ex-wife's
mailing address?

521
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,949
Come here!
Open your mouth.

522
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,950
- What?
- Open!

523
00:37:53,118 --> 00:37:54,949
What are you doing?

524
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:58,949
If you tell, I'm going to
go missing again...

525
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,949
and it's going to
break their hearts

526
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:03,117
and it's going to be
all your fault.

527
00:38:03,118 --> 00:38:04,950
- All your fault.
<i>- Let's go, boys.</i>

528
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,950
<i>Mitchell!</i>

529
00:39:37,118 --> 00:39:40,950
Mitchell!
I got the test results.

530
00:39:40,951 --> 00:39:42,949
What does it say?

531
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,950
It's nothing
I didn't already know.

532
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,949
Sorry, gang.
Traffic was a nightmare.

533
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,826
- Summer.
- Hi, Dad.

534
00:39:57,827 --> 00:39:59,950
Hey. Come here.

535
00:39:59,951 --> 00:40:02,949
Listen,
I never really doubted it,

536
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,949
but it's good to know,
to really know, all right?

537
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:05,950
Yeah.

538
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:10,949
What's up, guy?
We good?

539
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:11,950
- Yeah. We're good.
- All right.

540
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,451
I need a ride into town.

541
00:40:14,452 --> 00:40:16,659
Honey,
this is family time.

542
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,949
Well, you should have
told me that

543
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,950
before I promised Beth
I would be there last week.

544
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:21,949
Come on.
This is the first time

545
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:22,949
we're all having dinner
as a family.

546
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,950
Okay, well, I said
I was going to be there.

547
00:40:24,951 --> 00:40:26,950
I can take her...

548
00:40:26,951 --> 00:40:29,949
if one of you guys
will let me borrow your car.

549
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:30,949
Well, I don't think
that'd be a good idea.

550
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,949
You can take mine.

551
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:33,949
You really okay
with him driving?

552
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:35,949
Yeah, I'm okay with him
driving my car.

553
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:36,950
I think it's fine.
Mitchell drops her off.

554
00:40:36,951 --> 00:40:38,949
We'll pick you up
at 11:00.

555
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:39,949
- Midnight.
- 10:30.

556
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:42,949
That,
or I can just hang out

557
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,949
and you don't have to
pick her up.

558
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:45,949
If that's cool with you,
I'd like to meet your friends.

559
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,659
What about family time?

560
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,949
Summer is my family.

561
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,949
Unless you guys think
it's a bad idea.

562
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,659
- No. No, no.
- I didn't say that.

563
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,949
I mean, I'm okay with it
if you are.

564
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:58,950
Yeah, I'm fine with it.

565
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:08,950
What?

566
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,826
You drive.

567
00:41:14,827 --> 00:41:16,949
<i>I don't even
have my permit.</i>

568
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:19,117
<i>Dad's making me wait 'cause of
something that I did.</i>

569
00:41:19,118 --> 00:41:22,949
I knew we had
something in common.

570
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,949
I don't either.

571
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:25,950
Oh, my God!

572
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,660
Nobody asked.

573
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,285
You drive or you walk.
It's your choice.

574
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,451
I don't know.

575
00:41:40,452 --> 00:41:43,949
I know it's scary...

576
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:46,950
but there's something exciting
about it, don't you think?

577
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:00,950
Okay.

578
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,949
Guess what.

579
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,451
What?

580
00:42:16,452 --> 00:42:17,949
Let's go into...

581
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:20,949
No!
This is not happening.

582
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:21,950
Stop!

583
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:28,949
He's kind of old for her,
don't you think?

584
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,950
I wouldn't get all brotherly
and protective about it.

585
00:42:30,951 --> 00:42:32,950
She's fine.

586
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:34,949
You're mad at me.

587
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:35,950
You could have told me.

588
00:42:38,452 --> 00:42:39,950
No, I couldn't have.

589
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:44,950
Everyone is
talking about you.

590
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:51,950
Like my mom thinks
you're a total delinquent.

591
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:54,950
Like dangerous.

592
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:57,950
Show me your room.

593
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:03,949
Well, I'm glad you called

594
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:07,949
even if it is to just
help you sort paperwork.

595
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:11,659
It wasn't
just for paperwork.

596
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,950
I'm glad.

597
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,659
Ahem!

598
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,827
Oh!

599
00:43:19,827 --> 00:43:22,949
This is for you.
This is mine.

600
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:24,949
Cheers!

601
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:25,950
Cheers!

602
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:43,949
I'm not used to...
to your hand.

603
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:45,950
Yeah,
it's different, isn't it?

604
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:58,950
I never really, you know...

605
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:03,949
I'm not going to do anything
you don't want to do.

606
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:06,950
Trust me. You're going to
want me to do everything.

607
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:20,950
This is so cool.

608
00:44:20,951 --> 00:44:24,949
Yeah. Summer said
she wants to get one.

609
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:26,949
Really?

610
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:28,949
But she's scared to death
of needles.

611
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:30,950
You scared
to death of anything?

612
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:54,949
Thank you.

613
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:56,950
I would love to
see you again.

614
00:44:56,951 --> 00:44:59,950
I'd love to
meet your son.

615
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:26,949
Hi. Did you have
a good time?

616
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:29,660
- You did.
- Excuse me?

617
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:35,451
Maybe me living here
isn't such a good idea.

618
00:45:35,452 --> 00:45:36,949
Interrupting your life...

619
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:37,949
Wait a minute.
Where is this coming from?

620
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:41,949
Where is my family?

621
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:43,949
What did you let happen
to my family?

622
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:47,949
We are your family.
We're it. This is your family.

623
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:51,949
It's not the same!
It's wrong, all wrong!

624
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:54,949
Mitchell!
No, no!

625
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:58,949
I want my family back!
I want my life back!

626
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:00,949
<i>In a abduction like this</i>

627
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:03,949
<i>where a young boy has been
missing for over a decade,</i>

628
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:05,949
<i>in all likelihood
Mitchell Harris</i>

629
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,949
<i>not only experienced
emotional abuse</i>

630
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:11,949
<i>but also physical
and sexual abuse.</i>

631
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:14,951
<i>Outside the Harris house,
KCDY-6.</i>

632
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:25,949
<i>So you think it's okay to get
a tattoo without even asking?</i>

633
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,117
<i>This is so ridiculous!
I'm almost 18.</i>

634
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,949
<i>It's not a big deal, Dad.</i>

635
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:31,949
<i>What he's trying to say.</i>

636
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:34,949
<i>Don't tell me
what he's trying to say.</i>

637
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:37,950
<i>Summer, don't talk to...
She's not my mother!</i>

638
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:42,949
Hey...

639
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:43,949
It's my fault.

640
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:44,949
I'll take care of it,
all right?

641
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:46,117
- Really?
- Yeah.

642
00:46:46,118 --> 00:46:47,950
Where have you been
all my life?

643
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:52,950
<i>You're up next...</i>

644
00:46:52,951 --> 00:46:55,949
Hey!

645
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:58,950
I wanted to apologize
for the tattoo.

646
00:46:58,951 --> 00:47:01,949
Oh, it's Summer's fault.
Don't worry about that.

647
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:04,949
No, it was
my brilliant idea.

648
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:06,949
She's my twin.

649
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:09,117
I thought that it would
bring us closer together,

650
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:12,950
but I've gotten her in trouble.

651
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:17,950
I'm sorry.
I'm, I'm a mess.

652
00:47:17,951 --> 00:47:20,949
I don't know
how to belong in a family,

653
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:23,659
and I've already
changed your lives.

654
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:24,950
Changing for the better.

655
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:28,950
Okay. Let's see it.

656
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:33,949
Wow, that's
a stunning design.

657
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:36,659
You like it?

658
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:37,949
Well, you should have asked your
dad and my permission first,

659
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:39,949
but knowing how you feel
about needles,

660
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:41,950
it's kind of amazing you
had the courage to do it.

661
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,949
Okay. You were right.

662
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:53,949
That was the perfect way
to play it.

663
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:55,950
Hopefully it makes up
for the other night.

664
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:00,950
I'm sorry.

665
00:48:01,801 --> 00:48:05,800
I know, but you're
a member of this family,

666
00:48:05,801 --> 00:48:08,800
and you should have
asked our permission,

667
00:48:08,801 --> 00:48:10,800
but I haven't seen Summer
look at me like that

668
00:48:10,801 --> 00:48:13,510
in the longest time.

669
00:48:13,511 --> 00:48:14,801
Thank you.

670
00:48:21,724 --> 00:48:23,723
<i>Wait. All right.
On three. Ready?</i>

671
00:48:23,724 --> 00:48:25,723
<i>On three.</i>

672
00:48:25,724 --> 00:48:27,723
One, two, three.

673
00:48:27,724 --> 00:48:30,724
I got it!
I did it!

674
00:48:32,724 --> 00:48:35,891
All right. I want to hear one thing
from each of you that I missed,

675
00:48:35,892 --> 00:48:37,724
starting with Jonathan.

676
00:48:37,725 --> 00:48:40,600
I was the bluebird
of happiness in a school play.

677
00:48:40,601 --> 00:48:41,723
You were the bluebird
of happiness?

678
00:48:41,724 --> 00:48:43,723
Yeah, it's about
this pumpkin patch

679
00:48:43,724 --> 00:48:45,433
and all the pumpkins talk.

680
00:48:45,434 --> 00:48:48,723
<i>And they want to get
picked on Halloween,</i>

681
00:48:48,724 --> 00:48:52,723
but they don't
want to get carved up.

682
00:48:52,724 --> 00:48:55,723
You never got to play
that part because...

683
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:58,723
you were taken
a couple of weeks before,

684
00:48:58,724 --> 00:49:01,433
and then they had
Sam Lerner play the part.

685
00:49:01,434 --> 00:49:04,724
They gave it to Sam Lerner?
I literally hated that kid.

686
00:49:06,724 --> 00:49:09,723
I know.
I didn't like him either.

687
00:49:09,724 --> 00:49:11,723
And I really wanted to see you

688
00:49:11,724 --> 00:49:14,723
in the show, Summer.

689
00:49:14,724 --> 00:49:18,723
I stood out in front of
the school for so long

690
00:49:18,724 --> 00:49:20,723
and I just...

691
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:23,723
I couldn't stand the thought
of seeing another kid

692
00:49:23,724 --> 00:49:25,433
and listening to them
say all those words

693
00:49:25,434 --> 00:49:26,724
that I'd rehearsed with you.

694
00:49:32,434 --> 00:49:35,723
Fly to the farm, right?

695
00:49:35,724 --> 00:49:37,723
I will fly to the farm!

696
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:39,433
I will fly to the store!

697
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:41,724
I will fly
to the people in town!

698
00:49:42,193 --> 00:49:45,148
Pumpkins,
they would say, pumpkins!

699
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:47,149
More, more!

700
00:49:47,238 --> 00:49:48,237
Queen Pumpkin here,

701
00:49:48,238 --> 00:49:51,237
and I decree
that none of my subjects

702
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:55,238
shall become jack-o-lanterns,
especially not me.

703
00:50:01,238 --> 00:50:02,238
Sorry.

704
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:19,740
Mitchell?

705
00:50:22,406 --> 00:50:23,740
Mitchell?

706
00:50:25,429 --> 00:50:27,428
We're not supposed to be
out here at night.

707
00:50:27,429 --> 00:50:28,429
Mitchell?

708
00:50:31,429 --> 00:50:32,429
Mitchell?

709
00:50:35,931 --> 00:50:36,931
Careful!

710
00:50:38,429 --> 00:50:39,429
Come on, bud.

711
00:50:41,429 --> 00:50:42,597
Careful.

712
00:50:47,429 --> 00:50:49,429
What are you doing?

713
00:50:51,429 --> 00:50:53,428
You hear that?

714
00:50:53,429 --> 00:50:56,428
That's gas.

715
00:50:56,429 --> 00:51:00,428
I'm going to teach you
survival skills.

716
00:51:00,429 --> 00:51:01,629
For when he comes
to get you...

717
00:51:05,597 --> 00:51:07,429
What are you doing?

718
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:11,428
You're scared.
It's okay.

719
00:51:11,429 --> 00:51:13,428
In all fear,
there is excitement.

720
00:51:13,429 --> 00:51:16,305
That's what
he's going to tell you.

721
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:17,429
Who?

722
00:51:21,429 --> 00:51:24,428
Wrong question.

723
00:51:24,429 --> 00:51:27,429
The question is,
how close does a flame

724
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:31,428
have to get to the gas

725
00:51:31,429 --> 00:51:36,596
before it ignites?

726
00:51:40,429 --> 00:51:41,429
We're down here, Mom.

727
00:51:48,429 --> 00:51:49,429
Hey!

728
00:51:51,429 --> 00:51:52,429
Can I sleep with you
tonight?

729
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:54,138
Of course you can!

730
00:51:54,139 --> 00:51:55,428
What's going on?

731
00:51:55,429 --> 00:51:58,428
I found him out here
playing with this lighter.

732
00:51:58,429 --> 00:52:01,428
Jonathan...
You know better than this.

733
00:52:01,429 --> 00:52:03,428
Seriously, bud,
it's not safe.

734
00:52:03,429 --> 00:52:05,428
You've got to be
more careful.

735
00:52:05,429 --> 00:52:06,429
Thanks, Mitchell.

736
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:14,429
- Sorry we got such a late start.
- No, it's okay.

737
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:16,428
Do you want
some eggs or something?

738
00:52:16,429 --> 00:52:18,428
No, thank you. I don't think
I can stomach it.

739
00:52:18,429 --> 00:52:20,428
Hey, Jonathan.
Your evil stepmother is here.

740
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:22,428
Mitchell!

741
00:52:22,429 --> 00:52:24,428
<i>That's okay.
That's all right.</i>

742
00:52:24,429 --> 00:52:26,428
Look, Summer, you're just
going to have to gulp it down.

743
00:52:26,429 --> 00:52:27,428
We've got to meet your Dad
for the amnio this morning.

744
00:52:27,429 --> 00:52:28,596
Are you worried?

745
00:52:28,597 --> 00:52:30,428
Crazy trying-not-to-
think-about-it worried.

746
00:52:30,429 --> 00:52:32,428
Oh, here comes
the sleepy man.

747
00:52:32,429 --> 00:52:34,139
Johnny,
you're still not dressed.

748
00:52:36,597 --> 00:52:37,596
<i>Well how about you take Summer</i>

749
00:52:37,597 --> 00:52:38,596
<i>and I'll take him.</i>

750
00:52:38,597 --> 00:52:40,428
Is that all right?
Yeah?

751
00:52:40,429 --> 00:52:41,428
Okay. Great.
Summer, let's go.

752
00:52:41,429 --> 00:52:44,428
Hey, Amanda.
Good luck today.

753
00:52:44,429 --> 00:52:46,596
I'm excited to see the
ultrasound of our new sister.

754
00:52:46,597 --> 00:52:49,305
Thank you.

755
00:52:49,306 --> 00:52:51,429
Yeah, we're, we're, uh,
really excited about it.

756
00:53:06,429 --> 00:53:10,305
Mitchell,
what are you doing here?

757
00:53:10,306 --> 00:53:13,428
You know, I just, I just
keep trying to keep it down

758
00:53:13,429 --> 00:53:18,429
and it just keeps
poisoning me.

759
00:53:22,429 --> 00:53:23,597
Okay.
Let's get out of here.

760
00:53:33,429 --> 00:53:34,763
<i>Hi. You've reached
Greg Harris.</i>

761
00:53:34,764 --> 00:53:36,428
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

762
00:53:36,429 --> 00:53:39,428
I'm sure he's on his way.
Lawyers, you know.

763
00:53:39,429 --> 00:53:41,428
<i>Greg Harris's office.</i>

764
00:53:41,429 --> 00:53:44,428
Rita, it's Amanda. Hi.

765
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:48,428
What time did Greg leave for the doctor's?
I'm here waiting, and I thought...

766
00:53:48,429 --> 00:53:51,428
<i>I'm so sorry. He just left
with Mitchell actually.</i>

767
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:52,596
Oh, they did?

768
00:53:52,597 --> 00:53:55,428
<i>Yeah, they just left.</i>

769
00:53:55,429 --> 00:53:56,429
Yeah.

770
00:53:59,429 --> 00:54:01,428
Jonathan, we're so late
at this point,

771
00:54:01,429 --> 00:54:03,306
I don't know
if it's worth take...

772
00:54:07,764 --> 00:54:10,429
Tell me that's one of
your movie magic tricks.

773
00:54:15,429 --> 00:54:17,429
What happened, honey?

774
00:54:23,429 --> 00:54:25,763
<i>I don't know
why I went with him.</i>

775
00:54:25,764 --> 00:54:28,429
I thought
that they were nice.

776
00:54:31,139 --> 00:54:32,429
<i>I was so stupid.</i>

777
00:54:36,429 --> 00:54:41,305
They put me
in the trunk of the car.

778
00:54:41,306 --> 00:54:44,139
All I wanted to do was
to get out of that trunk.

779
00:54:47,429 --> 00:54:50,429
Yeah but...
But when they took me out...

780
00:54:53,429 --> 00:54:55,429
<i>The things that they did--</i>

781
00:54:57,429 --> 00:55:01,429
I wanted to go back in,
into the trunk.

782
00:55:05,429 --> 00:55:07,428
<i>He would film videos of me</i>

783
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:11,429
<i>with her... and him.</i>

784
00:55:13,429 --> 00:55:15,306
They moved around a lot.

785
00:55:17,597 --> 00:55:20,428
When I was 13,
I started thinking

786
00:55:20,429 --> 00:55:22,429
that he was going
to kill me.

787
00:55:27,597 --> 00:55:30,931
So I did what I had to do
to get out of there. I...

788
00:55:40,429 --> 00:55:41,429
I can't--

789
00:55:43,597 --> 00:55:46,428
I'm messed up.

790
00:55:46,429 --> 00:55:48,428
- No.
- I'm messed up.

791
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:52,428
No, you're not.
No, you're not.

792
00:55:52,429 --> 00:55:56,428
We love you.
I love you.

793
00:55:56,429 --> 00:55:58,428
I should go to jail
for what I did.

794
00:55:58,429 --> 00:56:00,305
- You shouldn't...
- No, no, no.

795
00:56:00,306 --> 00:56:03,138
Hey, you did
what you had to do.

796
00:56:03,139 --> 00:56:05,428
There's nothing
to be ashamed of.

797
00:56:05,429 --> 00:56:08,596
We don't have to tell
anybody about this, okay?

798
00:56:08,597 --> 00:56:11,428
But if I'm not
a good person?

799
00:56:11,429 --> 00:56:14,138
Hey...

800
00:56:14,139 --> 00:56:15,429
Hey, look at me.

801
00:56:17,429 --> 00:56:19,428
You're good.

802
00:56:19,429 --> 00:56:21,429
You're my son.

803
00:56:22,429 --> 00:56:23,597
You're good.

804
00:56:53,429 --> 00:56:55,138
Hey.

805
00:56:55,139 --> 00:56:56,597
How could you do it?

806
00:56:58,429 --> 00:57:00,428
What are you talking about?

807
00:57:00,429 --> 00:57:03,428
He's a little boy...
and you hurt him.

808
00:57:03,429 --> 00:57:05,428
You're scaring me.

809
00:57:05,429 --> 00:57:09,428
You used Jonathan, then you
made him keep it a secret.

810
00:57:09,429 --> 00:57:10,428
I trusted you.

811
00:57:10,429 --> 00:57:12,305
Mom...

812
00:57:12,306 --> 00:57:15,428
You can't think that I
would let you hurt him.

813
00:57:15,429 --> 00:57:18,428
We were just
messing around.

814
00:57:18,429 --> 00:57:20,428
I, I think Jonathan
might have explained it...

815
00:57:20,429 --> 00:57:22,429
Don't lie to me!

816
00:57:24,429 --> 00:57:27,428
I was so sure.

817
00:57:27,429 --> 00:57:28,429
If you're not...

818
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:29,596
I was scared.

819
00:57:29,597 --> 00:57:31,429
We're all scared!

820
00:57:33,429 --> 00:57:37,429
I have... these memories.

821
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:42,428
What if they aren't
the right memories?

822
00:57:42,429 --> 00:57:45,428
I remember this house.

823
00:57:45,429 --> 00:57:49,428
But what if it's
not quite like this house--

824
00:57:49,429 --> 00:57:52,429
It's just a house
similar to this house?

825
00:57:53,429 --> 00:57:56,764
And my mom has light hair
and a great laugh.

826
00:57:59,139 --> 00:58:01,597
What if it's not
exactly your laugh?

827
00:58:05,429 --> 00:58:08,139
Does that mean
that you're not my mom?

828
00:58:11,429 --> 00:58:15,428
I couldn't bear you
thinking that, okay?

829
00:58:15,429 --> 00:58:19,429
I, I wanted there to be
no question.

830
00:58:22,429 --> 00:58:26,429
You and I are going back
to the lab... tomorrow.

831
00:58:46,306 --> 00:58:49,428
I'm sorry I missed the amnio.

832
00:58:49,429 --> 00:58:52,138
Mitchell needed me, and I...

833
00:58:52,139 --> 00:58:56,429
You know, Greg, I will not
have my baby be neglected

834
00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:59,429
just because
Mitchell has come home.

835
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:02,428
That's not what happened.
I mean if you knew...

836
00:59:02,429 --> 00:59:04,428
Then tell me.

837
00:59:04,429 --> 00:59:07,428
I, I promised him
that I wouldn't.

838
00:59:07,429 --> 00:59:08,428
Of course you did.

839
00:59:08,429 --> 00:59:10,428
Well, he's my son!

840
00:59:10,429 --> 00:59:12,429
And this baby
is going to be your daughter,

841
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:16,430
and I thought
I was going to be your wife.

842
00:59:17,597 --> 00:59:18,764
You are.

843
00:59:21,429 --> 00:59:24,428
Eventually, right?

844
00:59:24,429 --> 00:59:26,428
Look, Mitchell came home
and then everything just...

845
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:30,138
Yes, yes, Greg.
Mitchell came home...

846
00:59:30,139 --> 00:59:34,428
and this family that you've
been wanting back all this time

847
00:59:34,429 --> 00:59:35,429
is complete again.

848
00:59:38,429 --> 00:59:40,429
Where does that leave me?

849
00:59:41,429 --> 00:59:42,429
With me.

850
00:59:43,429 --> 00:59:45,429
It leaves you with me.

851
00:59:47,429 --> 00:59:48,429
Prove it.

852
00:59:54,597 --> 00:59:56,429
<i>Mom! Mom!</i>

853
01:00:00,306 --> 01:00:01,429
<i>Don't let them take me!</i>

854
01:00:08,597 --> 01:00:09,764
Wake up!
Wake up!

855
01:00:12,429 --> 01:00:14,139
You're okay.
You're okay.

856
01:00:16,764 --> 01:00:18,306
It's all right now.

857
01:00:19,931 --> 01:00:24,764
I'm sorry.
You sent me away.

858
01:00:26,429 --> 01:00:28,429
Don't make me
leave you again.

859
01:00:30,429 --> 01:00:33,428
I'd kill myself, I swear to God,
if I have to go back there.

860
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:35,428
It's all right.
You're not going anywhere.

861
01:00:35,429 --> 01:00:37,428
Do you understand?

862
01:00:37,429 --> 01:00:38,469
You're not going anywhere.

863
01:00:39,429 --> 01:00:40,429
It's all right.

864
01:00:43,429 --> 01:00:45,428
Just rest, all right?

865
01:00:45,429 --> 01:00:46,429
Just rest.

866
01:01:48,139 --> 01:01:50,305
Lobster, huh?

867
01:01:50,306 --> 01:01:52,428
Yeah.

868
01:01:52,429 --> 01:01:54,306
Lucky for you
Mitchell overbought.

869
01:01:57,429 --> 01:01:58,429
Very lucky.

870
01:02:02,429 --> 01:02:04,428
You remember
when for Halloween,

871
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:05,429
she decided that
she wanted to be a boy

872
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:08,428
- because he got all the cool stuff?
- No.

873
01:02:08,429 --> 01:02:09,428
She wanted to be a boy
for the rest of her life.

874
01:02:09,429 --> 01:02:11,138
Oh, she did.
That's right.

875
01:02:11,139 --> 01:02:12,596
- She wanted to shave.
- I wanted to shave?

876
01:02:12,597 --> 01:02:14,763
Yes. And she
wanted to cut her hair.

877
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:16,429
And she said,
Dad, it's a man's world.

878
01:02:17,429 --> 01:02:18,596
I did not say that!

879
01:02:18,597 --> 01:02:20,428
Now you're making things up.

880
01:02:20,429 --> 01:02:21,428
I remember her
wanting to be a boy.

881
01:02:21,429 --> 01:02:22,428
I remember that.

882
01:02:22,429 --> 01:02:23,930
I don't even remember that.

883
01:02:23,931 --> 01:02:25,596
- I do.
- No, you don't.

884
01:02:25,597 --> 01:02:29,305
Oh, crap!
I am so incredibly late.

885
01:02:29,306 --> 01:02:31,428
- Amanda.
- Oh.

886
01:02:31,429 --> 01:02:33,428
I could stay here
all night, you guys,

887
01:02:33,429 --> 01:02:34,428
but I've really got to go.

888
01:02:34,429 --> 01:02:36,428
Well, I'll walk you
to the trail.

889
01:02:36,429 --> 01:02:38,138
- Bye, Dad.
- Good night, you guys.

890
01:02:38,139 --> 01:02:39,429
- Bye.
- Good night.

891
01:02:41,429 --> 01:02:44,428
Let's talk about all of
the things that you've done

892
01:02:44,429 --> 01:02:46,428
since I've just been
embarrassed.

893
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,429
Like when you...

894
01:02:50,429 --> 01:02:52,428
I can make it from here.

895
01:02:52,429 --> 01:02:53,429
Okay.

896
01:02:55,139 --> 01:02:56,428
It feels right,
doesn't it?

897
01:02:56,429 --> 01:02:58,428
Yeah.

898
01:02:58,429 --> 01:02:59,869
I mean, even though
it's not perfect.

899
01:03:01,429 --> 01:03:02,429
We're happy.

900
01:03:06,429 --> 01:03:08,429
Good night.

901
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:09,931
Good night.

902
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:21,429
No.

903
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:23,428
Hey, hey, hey.

904
01:03:23,429 --> 01:03:25,428
Don't worry.

905
01:03:25,429 --> 01:03:27,428
I wasn't expecting you
to cook.

906
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:31,428
- She microwaves. And she boils stuff.
- Hey.

907
01:03:31,429 --> 01:03:33,429
- Hey again.
- So is this him?

908
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:35,138
Him?

909
01:03:35,139 --> 01:03:36,429
<i>Not bad.</i>

910
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:38,138
Thanks.

911
01:03:38,139 --> 01:03:40,429
Mitchell,
come and meet Kyle.

912
01:03:42,429 --> 01:03:44,930
No. We've got to go.
Beth has to get home.

913
01:03:44,931 --> 01:03:46,305
She has curfew.

914
01:03:46,306 --> 01:03:47,428
It's 7:30.

915
01:03:47,429 --> 01:03:49,428
I know.
It's because of Mitchell.

916
01:03:49,429 --> 01:03:51,428
My mom needs to put down
the "People" magazine

917
01:03:51,429 --> 01:03:52,596
and get a life.

918
01:03:52,597 --> 01:03:54,428
Do you want me
to call her?

919
01:03:54,429 --> 01:03:55,930
It won't help.

920
01:03:55,931 --> 01:03:57,451
She thinks you're blinded
by his charm.

921
01:03:59,429 --> 01:04:01,305
Aren't we all?

922
01:04:01,306 --> 01:04:03,429
Gross! Let's split.
Let's go.

923
01:04:05,429 --> 01:04:07,428
Hey.

924
01:04:07,429 --> 01:04:09,306
Guess I should say
welcome home.

925
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:13,428
Who knows.
It might only be temporary.

926
01:04:13,429 --> 01:04:15,931
Don't talk like that.
You're not going anywhere.

927
01:04:23,429 --> 01:04:24,429
See you around.

928
01:04:28,429 --> 01:04:29,429
Hey.

929
01:04:32,429 --> 01:04:34,428
So I finally met him.

930
01:04:34,429 --> 01:04:35,429
Yeah.

931
01:04:42,429 --> 01:04:46,428
Wow, you take me
to the nicest places.

932
01:04:46,429 --> 01:04:47,429
Trust me.

933
01:04:57,429 --> 01:04:59,428
Watch your step.

934
01:04:59,429 --> 01:05:00,428
You lived here?

935
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:02,428
When there was enough room.

936
01:05:02,429 --> 01:05:05,138
Witness the
presidential suite.

937
01:05:05,139 --> 01:05:06,429
- It's beautiful.
- It's amazing.

938
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:08,764
I'm going to go
find us some drinks.

939
01:05:11,429 --> 01:05:12,930
It's gorgeous.

940
01:05:12,931 --> 01:05:14,428
You're gorgeous.

941
01:05:14,429 --> 01:05:15,596
Stop!

942
01:05:15,597 --> 01:05:17,429
Hey!

943
01:05:24,931 --> 01:05:26,429
What?

944
01:05:28,429 --> 01:05:31,428
It's just hard for me
to be happy.

945
01:05:31,429 --> 01:05:36,428
Well, that's what
time is for, right?

946
01:05:36,429 --> 01:05:37,430
To make things easier?

947
01:06:28,931 --> 01:06:32,138
- What are you doing?
- What the hell, man!

948
01:06:32,139 --> 01:06:33,429
I just...
I just thought that...

949
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:36,305
You thought what? Huh?

950
01:06:36,306 --> 01:06:38,428
I, just,
just was trying to...

951
01:06:38,429 --> 01:06:39,428
Trying to what, man?

952
01:06:39,429 --> 01:06:41,139
I was just
trying to get close to...

953
01:06:42,429 --> 01:06:44,428
That's not how
you get close to me.

954
01:06:44,429 --> 01:06:45,429
This is sick!

955
01:06:47,139 --> 01:06:49,428
Screw me, right?

956
01:06:49,429 --> 01:06:52,429
I, I mean, not that you would.
It's like...

957
01:06:53,429 --> 01:06:54,429
Stuart!

958
01:06:57,429 --> 01:07:00,138
Mitchell!
Mitchell!

959
01:07:00,139 --> 01:07:01,429
Stop it! Mitchell!

960
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:03,138
Stop it!

961
01:07:03,139 --> 01:07:04,764
Get off! Stop it!

962
01:07:45,429 --> 01:07:46,428
Best man?

963
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:48,428
For our small, very small,

964
01:07:48,429 --> 01:07:49,429
barely pulled together wedding
a week from Sunday.

965
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:51,428
Yeah!

966
01:07:51,429 --> 01:07:52,596
Congratulations.
I'm happy for you.

967
01:07:52,597 --> 01:07:54,763
A toast...

968
01:07:54,764 --> 01:07:59,428
To this family's future with
happiness, health and Mitchell.

969
01:07:59,429 --> 01:08:01,305
Oooh, Jonathan!

970
01:08:01,306 --> 01:08:03,428
Whoa, whoa!
Uh-oh! I'll get this.

971
01:08:03,429 --> 01:08:05,428
It's okay. Come on, come off
the floor, come with me.

972
01:08:05,429 --> 01:08:06,429
All right.

973
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:07,764
<i>Be careful.</i>

974
01:08:10,429 --> 01:08:12,428
You didn't have to
say that to them.

975
01:08:12,429 --> 01:08:14,428
I meant it.

976
01:08:14,429 --> 01:08:15,469
You don't have to be nice.

977
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:21,428
I hate him.

978
01:08:21,429 --> 01:08:22,428
Summer!

979
01:08:22,429 --> 01:08:24,429
No. Just side with him.

980
01:08:24,430 --> 01:08:26,429
Don't even ask me
what's wrong, Mom.

981
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:29,428
It's not like you gave me
a second to ask.

982
01:08:29,429 --> 01:08:31,428
It's just you don't
want to hear it, Mom.

983
01:08:31,429 --> 01:08:33,428
You're just happy that your
precious little boy is back.

984
01:08:33,429 --> 01:08:34,764
That's all you care about.

985
01:08:41,429 --> 01:08:42,429
Kyle.

986
01:08:46,429 --> 01:08:47,429
Oh, my God!

987
01:08:52,931 --> 01:08:56,428
Leave me alone.

988
01:08:56,429 --> 01:08:58,428
You think you know me...

989
01:08:58,429 --> 01:09:00,428
You tell Mom anything,

990
01:09:00,429 --> 01:09:04,429
I'm going to cut your mouth
out of your face.

991
01:09:11,429 --> 01:09:13,428
You should have called me.

992
01:09:13,429 --> 01:09:15,429
I did once I woke up.

993
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:19,428
Did you file a police report?

994
01:09:19,429 --> 01:09:21,428
Oh, my God!

995
01:09:21,429 --> 01:09:25,596
Well, I was trying to
figure out what to say.

996
01:09:25,597 --> 01:09:27,429
What do you mean?

997
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:31,428
Have you had him evaluated--

998
01:09:31,429 --> 01:09:32,428
Mitchell, do you know

999
01:09:32,429 --> 01:09:34,428
what you're dealing with?

1000
01:09:34,429 --> 01:09:37,429
What does that
have to do with anything?

1001
01:09:39,429 --> 01:09:41,429
I think maybe he's the one
that attacked me.

1002
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:44,138
Why would you say that?

1003
01:09:44,139 --> 01:09:45,428
Look, I didn't see his face.

1004
01:09:45,429 --> 01:09:46,428
He was wearing a hoodie,

1005
01:09:46,429 --> 01:09:49,428
but the same height,
same build.

1006
01:09:49,429 --> 01:09:51,428
So you automatically
assume it's my kid?

1007
01:09:51,429 --> 01:09:53,138
- No.
- That's a big jump.

1008
01:09:53,139 --> 01:09:54,428
Especially since
you didn't see his face.

1009
01:09:54,429 --> 01:09:56,428
I know he's your son.
I know this,

1010
01:09:56,429 --> 01:10:00,428
but you have to admit
he's not the same boy...

1011
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:01,930
you lost at the beach.

1012
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:05,428
Stop it.
Stop it.

1013
01:10:05,429 --> 01:10:07,428
You don't think
I know what I'm doing?

1014
01:10:07,429 --> 01:10:09,428
No. I care about you

1015
01:10:09,429 --> 01:10:10,709
and I don't want you
to get hurt.

1016
01:10:12,931 --> 01:10:14,429
I care about you, too.

1017
01:10:18,429 --> 01:10:20,429
But Mitchell
has to come first.

1018
01:10:22,429 --> 01:10:25,931
I can't do this.

1019
01:11:08,429 --> 01:11:10,429
Where were you last night?

1020
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:12,931
Hey.

1021
01:11:16,429 --> 01:11:17,931
Where were you last night?

1022
01:11:20,429 --> 01:11:21,429
What do you mean?

1023
01:11:24,429 --> 01:11:25,429
I need to know.

1024
01:11:28,429 --> 01:11:31,428
Okay, umm...

1025
01:11:31,429 --> 01:11:33,428
if, if you need to know,

1026
01:11:33,429 --> 01:11:34,429
I um...

1027
01:11:41,429 --> 01:11:42,764
I was getting you this.

1028
01:11:46,139 --> 01:11:47,429
Oh.

1029
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:51,428
I figured since
you're not going to be

1030
01:11:51,429 --> 01:11:53,428
looking for me anymore,

1031
01:11:53,429 --> 01:11:55,469
you know, maybe you can start
taking pictures again.

1032
01:12:04,429 --> 01:12:06,428
Happy early birthday.

1033
01:12:06,429 --> 01:12:07,429
Thank you.

1034
01:12:17,931 --> 01:12:19,429
Kyle and I broke up.

1035
01:12:23,429 --> 01:12:24,429
I'm sorry.

1036
01:12:27,429 --> 01:12:30,138
I thought you'd be happy
about that.

1037
01:12:30,139 --> 01:12:33,429
No. I, I just--
I want you to be happy.

1038
01:13:05,429 --> 01:13:08,428
Here you go, buddy.

1039
01:13:08,429 --> 01:13:11,429
Aw, come on.
No smile for chocolate milk?

1040
01:13:13,429 --> 01:13:17,428
Oh, shoot!
Oh, shoot! Okay. All right.

1041
01:13:17,429 --> 01:13:18,429
It's okay.
It's okay.

1042
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:22,428
- Let's take this off.
- No! Don't.

1043
01:13:22,429 --> 01:13:24,428
I'm just going to wash it.
It's going to stink.

1044
01:13:24,429 --> 01:13:25,430
Come on.
Hands up.

1045
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:28,428
Boy.

1046
01:13:28,429 --> 01:13:30,429
Oh, where's your head?
Here we go.

1047
01:13:31,597 --> 01:13:34,428
What are you doing?

1048
01:13:34,429 --> 01:13:36,930
Jonathan.
Jonathan.

1049
01:13:36,931 --> 01:13:38,596
It's just me.
What are you doing?

1050
01:13:38,597 --> 01:13:40,429
Come here.
Come here.

1051
01:13:42,429 --> 01:13:43,429
Oh, my God!

1052
01:13:45,429 --> 01:13:47,305
Jonathan,

1053
01:13:47,306 --> 01:13:48,764
you have to tell me
the truth, okay?

1054
01:13:59,429 --> 01:14:01,429
Greg!

1055
01:14:03,429 --> 01:14:04,429
Laura, are you here?

1056
01:14:06,429 --> 01:14:08,429
Come on, Greg.
Pick up.

1057
01:14:12,429 --> 01:14:14,428
Trying to call my dad?

1058
01:14:14,429 --> 01:14:16,428
My parents actually
just went for a walk.

1059
01:14:16,429 --> 01:14:18,429
Your parents.
That's... that's a good one.

1060
01:14:20,429 --> 01:14:21,763
What are you talking about?

1061
01:14:21,764 --> 01:14:23,428
What you did to Jonathan.

1062
01:14:23,429 --> 01:14:24,429
Don't touch me!

1063
01:14:26,429 --> 01:14:28,428
Are you okay?

1064
01:14:28,429 --> 01:14:30,428
You sound really unbalanced.

1065
01:14:30,429 --> 01:14:33,428
I think your pregnancy
hormones are kicking in.

1066
01:14:33,429 --> 01:14:35,428
You know, I think you have
more doubts than I do.

1067
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:37,429
You know you don't
belong in this family.

1068
01:14:38,429 --> 01:14:40,428
Greg!

1069
01:14:40,429 --> 01:14:43,596
I belong in this family
just as much as you do.

1070
01:14:43,597 --> 01:14:48,428
You see, what does it
matter what you think?

1071
01:14:48,429 --> 01:14:50,930
It matters what my mom thinks,
and she thinks I'm hers.

1072
01:14:50,931 --> 01:14:52,428
Not when I tell her
what you did.

1073
01:14:52,429 --> 01:14:56,428
She already knows what
I did because I told her.

1074
01:14:56,429 --> 01:14:58,428
What?

1075
01:14:58,429 --> 01:15:00,763
She doesn't care.

1076
01:15:00,764 --> 01:15:02,930
Wow, another lie.

1077
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:04,429
Greg!

1078
01:15:06,429 --> 01:15:08,429
See, you know nothing.

1079
01:15:09,931 --> 01:15:12,428
You don't know
what it's like to...

1080
01:15:12,429 --> 01:15:16,428
be ripped away from everything
you've ever loved.

1081
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:19,428
So if my mom loves me
and I love her,

1082
01:15:19,429 --> 01:15:21,428
isn't that enough?

1083
01:15:21,429 --> 01:15:24,596
Just because
you want it to be true,

1084
01:15:24,597 --> 01:15:27,428
it doesn't mean that it is.

1085
01:15:27,429 --> 01:15:28,428
Mitchell, listen to me.

1086
01:15:28,429 --> 01:15:30,428
We have no idea
who you really are.

1087
01:15:30,429 --> 01:15:33,429
You do not know
what it took to get me here!

1088
01:15:36,597 --> 01:15:41,428
I'm not going to let you take
away my family from me, okay?

1089
01:15:41,429 --> 01:15:43,429
And I'm not going to
let you destroy them!

1090
01:15:46,931 --> 01:15:48,306
All right?

1091
01:15:50,429 --> 01:15:53,428
I don't want to be lost again.
So why does your baby--

1092
01:15:53,429 --> 01:15:56,428
Why does your baby get that
guarantee, but I never will?

1093
01:15:56,429 --> 01:15:59,763
Okay, okay.
Mitchell, look, look.

1094
01:15:59,764 --> 01:16:03,428
You're right.
It's not fair,

1095
01:16:03,429 --> 01:16:06,428
but we can work this out,
all right?

1096
01:16:06,429 --> 01:16:07,428
No.

1097
01:16:07,429 --> 01:16:10,428
We can't work this out

1098
01:16:10,429 --> 01:16:12,139
because you're in the way...

1099
01:16:15,429 --> 01:16:16,469
of working everything out.

1100
01:16:19,429 --> 01:16:21,429
Jonathan, stay right there,
sweetie.

1101
01:16:22,429 --> 01:16:24,597
You get out of my way.

1102
01:16:26,429 --> 01:16:27,429
Amanda!

1103
01:16:33,429 --> 01:16:34,429
Did you hear that?

1104
01:16:36,429 --> 01:16:38,429
She pushed me first.
You saw it!

1105
01:16:42,429 --> 01:16:43,429
Mom!

1106
01:16:47,429 --> 01:16:48,429
Amanda!

1107
01:16:49,429 --> 01:16:50,428
Amanda!

1108
01:16:50,429 --> 01:16:52,305
Oh, my God!

1109
01:16:52,306 --> 01:16:54,428
Don't move, don't move!
Don't move.

1110
01:16:54,429 --> 01:16:56,428
The baby!
Oh, God!

1111
01:16:56,429 --> 01:16:58,763
The baby's
going to be fine.

1112
01:16:58,764 --> 01:17:02,428
- Get Jonathan. Get Jonathan.
<i>- Mommy!</i>

1113
01:17:02,429 --> 01:17:05,428
Mitchell!

1114
01:17:05,429 --> 01:17:07,428
Shh. Just breathe.

1115
01:17:07,429 --> 01:17:09,349
We're going to get help.
We're going to get help.

1116
01:17:11,597 --> 01:17:13,429
Mitchell!

1117
01:17:18,429 --> 01:17:20,428
Mom? Did you see Jonathan?

1118
01:17:20,429 --> 01:17:24,428
Where would he go? Summer, if you
have any idea, you have to tell me.

1119
01:17:24,429 --> 01:17:27,428
Um, I don't know. There's this
place in the city that he took...

1120
01:17:27,429 --> 01:17:29,429
- Where?
- I don't know the address.

1121
01:17:33,429 --> 01:17:35,429
There's got to be something.

1122
01:17:36,429 --> 01:17:38,429
An address, something.

1123
01:17:41,429 --> 01:17:42,429
Where's the kite?

1124
01:17:44,764 --> 01:17:46,428
Why would he take the kite?

1125
01:17:46,429 --> 01:17:48,428
Oh, my God!

1126
01:17:48,429 --> 01:17:50,428
He's going to the lake.

1127
01:17:50,429 --> 01:17:53,428
Mom, I'm coming with you.

1128
01:17:53,429 --> 01:17:55,428
No, stay here and help
your dad and Amanda

1129
01:17:55,429 --> 01:17:57,428
and get an Amber Alert
for your brother, for Jonathan.

1130
01:17:57,429 --> 01:17:58,428
Why can't I come with you?

1131
01:17:58,429 --> 01:18:00,428
Because if anything
happened to you...

1132
01:18:00,429 --> 01:18:02,428
I wouldn't be able
to survive that.

1133
01:18:02,429 --> 01:18:04,306
But what if he hurts you?

1134
01:18:11,429 --> 01:18:15,930
You told them about
our little game, Jonathan,

1135
01:18:15,931 --> 01:18:17,428
and now you ruined everything.

1136
01:18:17,429 --> 01:18:18,429
I didn't mean to.

1137
01:18:26,764 --> 01:18:30,428
Do you think...

1138
01:18:30,429 --> 01:18:33,306
I don't want to know
if I'm really him?

1139
01:18:34,429 --> 01:18:36,428
I wish... I wish I could
remember that day...

1140
01:18:36,429 --> 01:18:40,139
The kite... The beach.

1141
01:18:43,429 --> 01:18:45,139
It was this beach, right?

1142
01:18:46,429 --> 01:18:48,305
This beach.

1143
01:18:48,306 --> 01:18:52,428
You know, may--
Maybe they weren't my parents.

1144
01:18:52,429 --> 01:18:54,428
May-maybe they were lying

1145
01:18:54,429 --> 01:18:56,931
or maybe somebody gave me
to them because I was bad.

1146
01:18:59,306 --> 01:19:01,428
You know, it's not fair

1147
01:19:01,429 --> 01:19:04,429
that I get that and you...

1148
01:19:06,429 --> 01:19:08,429
It's not fair, okay?

1149
01:19:11,429 --> 01:19:14,428
Now they-- they
weren't my parents

1150
01:19:14,429 --> 01:19:18,428
because they were bad,
you know?

1151
01:19:18,429 --> 01:19:20,428
But people are not evil,

1152
01:19:20,429 --> 01:19:23,428
you know, they just--
They do evil things

1153
01:19:23,429 --> 01:19:27,429
because someone did something
bad to them once, okay?

1154
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:31,428
Come on, don't cry, okay?
Don't cry.

1155
01:19:31,429 --> 01:19:32,429
Okay?

1156
01:19:34,597 --> 01:19:37,429
You shouldn't be afraid
of the water, Johnny.

1157
01:19:39,429 --> 01:19:40,429
You be afraid of me.

1158
01:19:42,429 --> 01:19:45,429
Let's go!

1159
01:19:57,764 --> 01:19:59,429
You're going to be me.

1160
01:20:00,429 --> 01:20:02,429
I'm going to be him.

1161
01:20:05,429 --> 01:20:09,428
We should have you
make your own,

1162
01:20:09,429 --> 01:20:12,428
but there's not enough time.

1163
01:20:12,429 --> 01:20:13,428
There's not enough time.

1164
01:20:13,429 --> 01:20:14,428
We could do that now.

1165
01:20:14,429 --> 01:20:15,428
Oh, no.
You're going to run,

1166
01:20:15,429 --> 01:20:17,428
and you do not
let this take a dive

1167
01:20:17,429 --> 01:20:19,428
because then,
then he's going to get you

1168
01:20:19,429 --> 01:20:23,596
and you'll just be gone,
and I was, I was gone,

1169
01:20:23,597 --> 01:20:28,429
and then suddenly
I was just going to be gone.

1170
01:20:32,429 --> 01:20:34,428
No!

1171
01:20:34,429 --> 01:20:36,429
That is the second time,
Jonathan!

1172
01:20:43,429 --> 01:20:44,428
Look at me!
Look at me!

1173
01:20:44,429 --> 01:20:46,763
If you fight it...
If you fight it,

1174
01:20:46,764 --> 01:20:49,428
it's only going to
make it worse, okay?

1175
01:20:49,429 --> 01:20:53,305
Because you know what,
if you're lucky,

1176
01:20:53,306 --> 01:20:55,428
you'll forget about it all.

1177
01:20:55,429 --> 01:20:57,429
You'll forget about
it all, okay?

1178
01:20:59,429 --> 01:21:04,305
You won't be able to tell
between your dreams

1179
01:21:04,306 --> 01:21:05,428
and what really happened.

1180
01:21:05,429 --> 01:21:08,428
<i>Jonathan?
Oh, baby!</i>

1181
01:21:08,429 --> 01:21:12,428
Mitchell, stop.
Mitchell, let him go.

1182
01:21:12,429 --> 01:21:14,139
- Stop!
- <i> Don't hurt him!</i>

1183
01:21:15,429 --> 01:21:17,428
Give him to me.

1184
01:21:17,429 --> 01:21:18,428
Why, so you could
have him back

1185
01:21:18,429 --> 01:21:20,428
and forget about me?

1186
01:21:20,429 --> 01:21:21,428
- No.
- <i> And leave me behind again?</i>

1187
01:21:21,429 --> 01:21:22,428
No, Mitchell.

1188
01:21:22,429 --> 01:21:25,428
Stop! Stop right there.

1189
01:21:25,429 --> 01:21:26,429
Okay.

1190
01:21:28,429 --> 01:21:30,305
Mom!

1191
01:21:30,306 --> 01:21:33,428
He can't swim.
Give him to me!

1192
01:21:33,429 --> 01:21:34,930
No!

1193
01:21:34,931 --> 01:21:37,428
Mitchell, you don't
have to do this.

1194
01:21:37,429 --> 01:21:39,930
Just give him to me,
and you and I can talk.

1195
01:21:39,931 --> 01:21:42,428
No, you can talk right now.

1196
01:21:42,429 --> 01:21:44,428
Just give him to me,
Mitchell.

1197
01:21:44,429 --> 01:21:46,428
No!

1198
01:21:46,429 --> 01:21:47,429
Please!

1199
01:21:48,429 --> 01:21:52,429
Him or me.

1200
01:22:00,597 --> 01:22:02,306
Mom!

1201
01:22:04,429 --> 01:22:06,429
Give me my son!

1202
01:22:09,429 --> 01:22:11,429
No!

1203
01:22:26,139 --> 01:22:27,429
Jonathan!

1204
01:22:52,429 --> 01:22:53,597
<i>Mitchell!</i>

1205
01:23:08,429 --> 01:23:12,428
Okay.

1206
01:23:12,429 --> 01:23:13,429
Mom!

1207
01:23:16,764 --> 01:23:18,429
Mom!

1208
01:23:20,429 --> 01:23:24,429
Are you okay? Okay?
Oh, God, baby.

1209
01:23:28,429 --> 01:23:30,429
Oh, honey. It's okay.

1210
01:24:25,429 --> 01:24:27,428
How's Amanda?

1211
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:28,428
Oh, she's good.
She's good.

1212
01:24:28,429 --> 01:24:30,428
Much better.

1213
01:24:30,429 --> 01:24:32,306
She and the baby
are going to be fine.

1214
01:24:42,429 --> 01:24:46,429
You know, we could
drag the lake again...

1215
01:24:46,430 --> 01:24:48,429
if you want to.

1216
01:25:14,306 --> 01:25:15,429
What do you want to do?

1217
01:25:18,429 --> 01:25:19,429
I want to let him go.
