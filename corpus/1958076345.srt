00:09:43,104 --> 00:09:44,758
Kenny?

184
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:46,977
Yeah?

185
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:49,545
Uh, I had this set
at 75 during the day.

186
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:50,938
I didn't change it.

187
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:53,114
It's now at 50.

188
00:09:53,201 --> 00:09:55,333
Right, let me look at it.

189
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,161
[sighs]

190
00:09:57,292 --> 00:09:58,859
System seems to be okay.

191
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:00,401
You know, one of the workers
probably messed with it.

192
00:10:00,425 --> 00:10:02,950
- I'll ask them, okay?
- Okay. Thanks.

193
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,692
Oh, your back deck's
almost done.

194
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:07,670
It's gonna be beautiful.
You open up those doors,

195
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:10,305
it's gonna feel like your
entire living room is outside.

196
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:12,046
You gettin' me
through this, Kenny.

197
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:13,787
You gettin' me through!

198
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:16,006
- Thank you!
- [Kenny]: You bet.

199
00:10:16,137 --> 00:10:21,969
[tense music]

200
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:28,584
[Jules]: And when I saw
the thermostat set low,

201
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:30,455
I froze.

202
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:32,477
Even years from now, something
could happen to trigger you.

203
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:35,112
Your first thought
will be Billy.

204
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:36,350
That's what long-term
trauma does.

205
00:10:36,374 --> 00:10:40,117
It actually changes the brain.

206
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:42,337
He liked it cold.

207
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:45,079
I mean, really cold.

208
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:49,344
We used to fight about it,
control over the thermostat.

209
00:10:50,998 --> 00:10:55,045
Dana used to say, "Cold hands,
cold heart, close to death."

210
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:56,481
Hm.

211
00:10:56,568 --> 00:10:59,441
You know, b-before
he actually died.

212
00:10:59,528 --> 00:11:01,225
You won't always be so scared.

213
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:04,359
The brain is wired
for survival, though.

214
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:06,709
Takes time to learn
new responses.

215
00:11:06,796 --> 00:11:09,103
Give it time.

216
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,193
When we can calm
our fear response,

217
00:11:12,323 --> 00:11:14,630
we can see things clearly.

218
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:17,981
Make a rational decision instead
of one based off of fear.

219
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:19,200
Yeah, exactly.

220
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:21,550
How long did it take
you to calm down?

221
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,552
Well, it felt like
it was forever,

222
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:26,337
but I guess about
a minute or two.

223
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:27,575
And how long would
it have taken you

224
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:29,645
just a couple of months ago?

225
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:33,388
Uh-huh, Dana would've
had to come over

226
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:36,217
and check under every bed,

227
00:11:36,304 --> 00:11:39,176
then have some wine with me,
probably spend the night.

228
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:42,353
You're not the woman you were.

229
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,356
That's true.
Thanks to you.

230
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:46,967
Oh, you get all
the credit for that,

231
00:11:47,054 --> 00:11:49,796
and your classes.
You have a gift for this.

232
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:53,843
Helping people,
it comes naturally to you.

233
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:58,195
You know, in the
short time I taught,

234
00:11:58,282 --> 00:12:03,244
I've seen the emotion
that I can pull from people.

235
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:05,594
I'm putting a show together.

236
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:07,465
Of your work?
That's wonderful.

237
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:09,076
Not just of mine.

238
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:13,428
Um, some of my students
from my self-portrait class.

239
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:16,910
I could see them staring
at themselves on canvas,

240
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,000
finding healing and direction.

241
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,524
Jules the art therapist.

242
00:12:22,654 --> 00:12:24,744
Jules the art teacher, now.

243
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:29,009
Hey, you're an artist
no matter what.

244
00:12:29,096 --> 00:12:33,361
Nuh-oh, I know that look.

245
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:36,494
You wanna cut our session
short so you can go paint.

246
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,410
No, that's not...

247
00:12:39,497 --> 00:12:41,935
I mean...

248
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:44,938
I wanna capture this feeling,

249
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:48,419
but I don't even
know what to call it.

250
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:50,944
It's called fulfillment, Jules.
Nobody deserves it more.

251
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:58,778
[smooth, bright music]

252
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:12,095
Jules Moss?

253
00:13:12,226 --> 00:13:14,315
Jules Baker.
Moss was my married name.

254
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:16,202
I'm Detective Walker.
This is Detective Young.

255
00:13:16,273 --> 00:13:18,101
We're sorry to bother you.

256
00:13:18,188 --> 00:13:20,103
We just have a few questions.

257
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:22,236
- Can we come inside?
- Now?

258
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:25,195
My house is being renovated.
It's not a good time.

259
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:26,651
We don't mind.
It'll only be a few moments.

260
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:28,329
Yeah.

261
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:31,506
Okay, I guess you gonna
do what you wanna do.

262
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,946
I... I don't understand.
Why are you here, Detective?

263
00:13:37,077 --> 00:13:38,992
We need to talk about June 5th.

264
00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:41,472
- The night of the fire.
- Yeah, I remember that night.

265
00:13:41,603 --> 00:13:44,432
It's kind of burned in my head.

266
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,738
Well, we just need to go over
the details one more time.

267
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:49,002
Oh, from when my husband
tried to murder me?

268
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:50,568
No, no, no, no.

269
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:52,701
See, I've worked very hard
to move past that night.

270
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,790
I don't see why you
can't do the same.

271
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:56,270
We have new evidence suggesting

272
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:58,489
that your house fire
wasn't an accident.

273
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,969
The gas line was tampered with.

274
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,754
And given your relationship
with the deceased,

275
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:07,890
- you are a person of interest.
- I'm sorry.

276
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:11,198
You... you think
I torched my own home?

277
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:12,677
Now, why would I do that?

278
00:14:12,764 --> 00:14:14,418
Well, why don't you tell us?

279
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:17,291
You left your husband
in that house.

280
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:19,597
He died in that fire, Ms. Baker.

281
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:22,644
He tried to kill me in
that fire, Detective Walker!

282
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:24,907
But the fire is now suspicious,

283
00:14:25,038 --> 00:14:26,438
and given your
complicated history...

284
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:29,564
It's not complicated.

285
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:31,522
He made my life hell.
I reported it.

286
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:33,089
I couldn't get a
restraining order

287
00:14:33,176 --> 00:14:38,181
because they told me you
can't press charges for words.

288
00:14:38,268 --> 00:14:40,749
Hm.

289
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,145
You stand to gain a lot
of money from his death.

290
00:14:45,232 --> 00:14:46,842
Yeah?

291
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,975
It seems like enough reason to...

292
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:51,325
Off my husband?

293
00:14:51,412 --> 00:14:53,893
You want motive?
How about alimony?

294
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,112
Billy Moss made a lot of money.

295
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:58,636
I had every reason to keep him
alive for a long, long time...

296
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:01,422
Away from me, but alive.

297
00:15:01,552 --> 00:15:04,686
Well, you've been
spending a lot of money,

298
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:06,079
rebuilding the house.

299
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:11,040
And after such
a short grieving process,

300
00:15:11,171 --> 00:15:13,390
you started a new relationship.

301
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:17,046
Oh, I'm sorry.
It is new, isn't it?

302
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:19,440
Are you following me?

303
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:21,877
We have been keeping an
eye on you here at the house

304
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:23,792
and at the gallery.

305
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:26,229
I knew I saw
someone at the gallery.

306
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,623
Jesus Christ, you people!

307
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,190
Here's how it's
gonna go, Ms. Baker.

308
00:15:30,277 --> 00:15:32,453
Jules?

309
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,585
Oh my god, don't shoot.
I'm just the neighbor.

310
00:15:34,716 --> 00:15:36,370
Naomi, what are you doing here?

311
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,763
- [Naomi]: Uh...
- I'm sorry.

312
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:40,983
I saw the squad car out front,

313
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,680
so I wanted to make
sure you were okay.

314
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:44,944
I'm fine.

315
00:15:45,031 --> 00:15:48,599
But when an officer
pulls a gun in my house,

316
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,951
it's time for you to leave.

317
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:54,518
You are done here...
Right, Officers?

318
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:56,694
Detectives.

319
00:15:56,781 --> 00:16:00,524
And yes, thank you.

320
00:16:00,611 --> 00:16:04,354
Oh, one more thing.

321
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:08,097
Given the circumstances,
the insurance companies

322
00:16:08,228 --> 00:16:10,447
are more than happy to wait

323
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:13,798
until we've finished our
investigation before paying out.

324
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:15,496
Good luck on your renovation.

325
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,741
And if you think of
anything that might help

326
00:16:20,849 --> 00:16:26,115
with our investigation,
please feel free to call.

327
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:28,639
And I'm sorry.

328
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:40,042
I can't believe this!

329
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:41,391
That was crazy!
Are you okay?

330
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:42,827
Yeah... no...

331
00:16:42,914 --> 00:16:44,046
God, god, I don't know.

332
00:16:44,177 --> 00:16:46,570
I thought I had put
all this behind me.

333
00:16:46,657 --> 00:16:48,398
And now they think
I killed Billy?

334
00:16:48,485 --> 00:16:50,618
That's crazy!

335
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:52,620
It's not surprising,
the way that people talk.

336
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,796
And they've been watching
me at the gallery.

337
00:16:54,926 --> 00:16:57,320
They think I've started up
a new relationship.

338
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:58,713
You started a new relationship?

339
00:16:58,843 --> 00:17:00,193
[Jules]: No.

340
00:17:00,323 --> 00:17:01,890
But I can if I want to.
It's my life.

341
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,848
Billy doesn't
control it anymore.

342
00:17:03,935 --> 00:17:07,156
- Right.
- God.

343
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:08,896
Think I can get one of those?

344
00:17:08,983 --> 00:17:10,594
Yeah, I'm sorry.

345
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:11,900
[Naomi]: Thank you.

346
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,424
I'm sorry about
that bottle, too.

347
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:16,644
Ah, don't worry about it.
We can clean it up later.

348
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:18,559
[Naomi]: Okay.

349
00:17:18,646 --> 00:17:19,951
Thanks for coming over.

350
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,127
You know me.

351
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:23,215
Butting in is kind of my jam.

352
00:17:23,346 --> 00:17:26,393
Man, I am so grateful
I have Ron.

353
00:17:26,522 --> 00:17:28,612
- Is that the new guy?
- What? No.

354
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:31,485
There... there's no guy.
Ron is my therapist.

355
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:34,488
He's been keeping me
sane ever since Billy.

356
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:37,360
I don't know how I'd
survive without him.

357
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:41,190
Promise me you'll call me
if you need anything, okay?

358
00:17:41,277 --> 00:17:42,583
Okay.

359
00:17:42,713 --> 00:17:44,237
I'm serious,
like, anything at all.

360
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:47,066
You know I'm all about us being
friends, not just neighbors.

361
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:49,285
Well, thank you,
I appreciate it.

362
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:54,943
[music]

363
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,220
Cheers!

364
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:23,624
[tense music]

365
00:18:25,278 --> 00:18:27,280
[pants]

366
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,412
Shhhhhh...

367
00:18:34,678 --> 00:18:38,117
[music grows intense]

368
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:43,296
[screams]

369
00:18:43,383 --> 00:18:45,646
[pants]

370
00:18:52,957 --> 00:18:54,655
[laughs]

371
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:56,091
You look beautiful.

372
00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:58,267
Thank you.
So do you.

373
00:18:58,398 --> 00:19:00,008
- You ready?
- Yeah.

374
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,232
I'm looking forward
to this date.

375
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,842
[laughs]

376
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:14,065
The police came to your house?
Why?

377
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,719
They think that I...

378
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,547
Oh, forget it.

379
00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:19,549
No, don't do that.

380
00:19:19,636 --> 00:19:21,725
For real, tell me.

381
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:24,206
Well, didn't you hear?
I'm a killer date.

382
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:25,990
Oh.

383
00:19:26,077 --> 00:19:29,385
And bringing a killer on
the first date to a taco truck,

384
00:19:29,516 --> 00:19:31,692
that's a bit risky.

385
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:33,659
But it's a slam dunk for
me, so you get to live.

386
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:35,783
[Both]: [laughing]

387
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,698
Oh, I see, you like Mexican.

388
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:39,874
I love Mexican.
Billy hated it

389
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:42,181
and I was never
allowed to eat tacos,

390
00:19:42,268 --> 00:19:44,574
and now all I wanna do
is eat tacos.

391
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:46,576
Never allowed?

392
00:19:46,663 --> 00:19:48,752
Jeez.

393
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:50,667
I guess some people
are like that.

394
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:52,167
They can't stand to
see anyone happy.

395
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,845
They always gotta
find a way to ruin it.

396
00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:56,934
Nah, he wasn't always like that.

397
00:19:57,021 --> 00:19:59,807
But man, towards the end?

398
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:01,678
That must've been hard
for you to live with.

399
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:05,334
You're the exact opposite.

400
00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:06,857
What do you mean?

401
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:12,385
Uh, I studied you
a bit in class.

402
00:20:12,472 --> 00:20:13,734
Mm-hmm!

403
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:15,431
[Both]: [laughing]

404
00:20:15,518 --> 00:20:18,260
Oh!

405
00:20:18,347 --> 00:20:21,307
Last week,
you seemed a bit down.

406
00:20:21,394 --> 00:20:24,701
But when Louisa was so excited
to paint light and shadows,

407
00:20:24,788 --> 00:20:26,573
you glowed.

408
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,704
You had this inner joy.

409
00:20:27,835 --> 00:20:31,752
You... you magnified it.

410
00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:33,275
Well, she killed it.

411
00:20:33,406 --> 00:20:34,537
Yeah.

412
00:20:34,624 --> 00:20:37,540
I mean, painting
light is very hard.

413
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:38,715
Will you tell it?

414
00:20:38,802 --> 00:20:41,022
[Both]: [laughing]

415
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:45,679
Should we order some more?

416
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:51,032
I mean, it being my first date,
I'm supposed to eat like a lady.

417
00:20:51,162 --> 00:20:54,775
But can we get four more
carne asadas, extra jalapeños?

418
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:56,342
[laughs]

419
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:57,560
Wanna feel the burn!

420
00:20:57,691 --> 00:21:01,564
Okay!
I think they got you.

421
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:04,654
- I have a question.
- Mm-hmm?

422
00:21:04,785 --> 00:21:06,917
Have you ever taken
martial arts classes?

423
00:21:07,004 --> 00:21:09,224
Really!

424
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:12,445
Oh, I can teach you a few moves.

425
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,968
Oh?

426
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:17,319
Wait, wait, no, wait.

427
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,842
[laughs]

428
00:21:18,973 --> 00:21:20,279
Defensive moves.

429
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:22,498
Uh-huh.

430
00:21:22,585 --> 00:21:25,153
I've been training
since I was nine years old.

431
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,025
I was... I was like the
little Black karate kid.

432
00:21:28,112 --> 00:21:29,592
- Wah!
- Watch out.

433
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,377
Oh, yup, oh, oh!

434
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:33,659
If I had some
chopsticks, I would...

435
00:21:33,683 --> 00:21:36,860
I would catch a fly right now.

436
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:39,341
No, and you know,
I still... I still train.

437
00:21:39,428 --> 00:21:42,866
I help out at the
dojo on 7th and Main.

438
00:21:42,953 --> 00:21:44,564
- Karate engineer.
- [Paul]: Mm-hmm.

439
00:21:44,694 --> 00:21:46,000
I'd love to see that.

440
00:21:47,828 --> 00:21:51,266
Really? Anytime.

441
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:54,182
They do a... they do
a class Saturday mornings.

442
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:55,575
They teach self-defense.

443
00:21:55,662 --> 00:21:59,405
And then after that, the...
You know what?

444
00:21:59,535 --> 00:22:01,711
You should come to see the kids.

445
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:02,973
Have to see the kids.

446
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,106
They're so inspiring to watch.

447
00:22:05,236 --> 00:22:06,847
You can actually
see their growth

448
00:22:06,934 --> 00:22:08,718
from one class to the next.

449
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:10,198
[gasps] Billy!

450
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:12,505
[sinister music]

451
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,379
What?

452
00:22:17,466 --> 00:22:21,296
Uh, I thought I saw my
husband, dead husband.

453
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:23,167
Where?

454
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:26,997
Over there by those trees?

455
00:22:27,128 --> 00:22:30,784
But I... I know I didn't see him
'cause he's not alive.

456
00:22:30,871 --> 00:22:33,395
My god, what is wrong with me?

457
00:22:33,482 --> 00:22:36,355
Jules, look at me.

458
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:39,227
Nothing is wrong with you.

459
00:22:39,314 --> 00:22:41,664
I wouldn't be so sure.

460
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:45,233
Every day I'm glad
that bastard's dead.

461
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,235
I know that's a
terrible thing to say.

462
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:51,370
You wanna talk about it?

463
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:57,071
I do, but... another night.

464
00:23:00,553 --> 00:23:05,732
Well, here's to another night.

465
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:20,399
[sinister music]

466
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:28,058
- [Paul]: So you're okay?
- [Jules]: I am, I am.

467
00:23:29,538 --> 00:23:33,237
Hey, I... thought I
left that light on.

468
00:23:33,324 --> 00:23:35,588
You sure?

469
00:23:35,675 --> 00:23:37,285
Y-yeah.

470
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,852
Never mind.

471
00:23:38,939 --> 00:23:40,723
I can go in there and
check it out for you.

472
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:44,031
No, it's... it's probably nothing.

473
00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:47,251
Okay, well, I had fun tonight.

474
00:23:47,338 --> 00:23:48,601
Me too.

475
00:23:48,688 --> 00:23:50,690
[whistle]

476
00:23:50,777 --> 00:23:51,995
Wait, what was that?

477
00:23:52,126 --> 00:23:53,562
What was that?

478
00:23:53,649 --> 00:23:55,651
[Naomi]: Abby?

479
00:23:55,738 --> 00:23:56,738
[whistles]

480
00:23:56,783 --> 00:23:58,437
Abby?

481
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:02,266
Oh, hi, I'm sorry, I didn't...

482
00:24:02,353 --> 00:24:04,138
I didn't mean to
interrupt anything.

483
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:06,270
No, no, it's okay.

484
00:24:06,357 --> 00:24:09,839
I'm, um, looking for Abby?

485
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:12,494
- Abby?
- My cat.

486
00:24:12,581 --> 00:24:14,670
Well, we just got home.
I haven't seen her.

487
00:24:14,801 --> 00:24:16,280
Okay.

488
00:24:19,588 --> 00:24:20,894
Who's this?

489
00:24:20,981 --> 00:24:25,942
- [chuckles] This is Paul.
- Paul, Naomi.

490
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:30,207
- It's nice to meet you, Paul.
- Nice to meet you as well.

491
00:24:30,294 --> 00:24:32,427
You know, I'll just... I'll
just get out of your way.

492
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:35,169
- Didn't mean... sorry.
- No, no, it's okay.

493
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:38,215
Um, good night, Paul.

494
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:40,653
- I'll call you tomorrow?
- Please.

495
00:24:43,307 --> 00:24:44,700
[Both]: [chuckling]

496
00:24:44,787 --> 00:24:46,667
- It's nice meeting you.
- Nice to meet you too.

497
00:24:51,707 --> 00:24:53,492
[laughs]

498
00:24:55,058 --> 00:24:57,887
Did I just interrupt some
pre-smashing of some sort?

499
00:24:58,018 --> 00:25:00,629
No, no, no, no, no.

500
00:25:00,716 --> 00:25:02,936
Okay, well, that's
the guy, right?

501
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:05,765
Yeah, that's the guy.

502
00:25:05,852 --> 00:25:08,332
I'll let you know if
I see Abby in the backyard.

503
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:09,899
Thank you. I appreciate it.

504
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,248
Welcome.

505
00:25:11,379 --> 00:25:12,598
Night.

506
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:15,601
[sighs]

507
00:25:15,731 --> 00:25:18,255
[tense music]

508
00:25:18,386 --> 00:25:19,692
What the hell?

509
00:25:23,696 --> 00:25:26,263
How is it set to 75?

510
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:32,226
[tense music]

511
00:25:43,063 --> 00:25:46,153
[music intensifies]

512
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:58,731
- [Kenny]: Jules?
- [screams]

513
00:25:58,818 --> 00:26:00,218
It's just me,
it's just me, just me.

514
00:26:00,254 --> 00:26:01,821
What are you doing here?

515
00:26:01,908 --> 00:26:04,068
I got a notification on my
phone about your thermostat.

516
00:26:04,127 --> 00:26:05,476
I came to fix it.

517
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,106
I just... I thought it
might override the system.

518
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,654
Seriously, you just
let yourself in?

519
00:26:08,741 --> 00:26:10,133
No, no, I... I
knocked on the door.

520
00:26:10,264 --> 00:26:11,570
I rang the bell.

521
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:13,057
I thought I was
gonna be in and out.

522
00:26:13,093 --> 00:26:14,834
I forgot my toolbox.

523
00:26:14,964 --> 00:26:16,705
[tools clanking]

524
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:19,578
- See?
- Yeah.

525
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:21,536
Well, I guess
I'll see you tomorrow.

526
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:24,147
- We're good?
- Yeah, we're good.

527
00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:25,453
Okay.

528
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:39,032
[Ron]: When was the
last time you slept?

529
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,687
I didn't last night.

530
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:45,473
The thermostat, the seeing
something in the park, I get.

531
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,042
But that picture?
Who put that there?

532
00:26:49,172 --> 00:26:51,305
Maybe one of the
construction guys found it.

533
00:26:51,392 --> 00:26:53,072
Didn't know whether
to throw it out or not.

534
00:26:55,483 --> 00:26:57,267
Consider sitting down, Jules.

535
00:26:59,835 --> 00:27:01,141

I think I saw my dead husband,
who the cops think I murdered,

There's a lot going on.

to calm yourself.

Yeah.

544
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:27,297
Close my eyes,
take three breaths in,

545

take three breaths out,
open my eyes.

546
00:27:30,387 --> 00:27:32,999
It's like a mini reset.
So go ahead.

Man, that really works.

548

a few more of them breaths

a way to run the numbers.

then you're gonna hold my wrist.

00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:48,771
No, it was... do it hard!
I got this gear on, you're good.

716
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:51,252
- All right, okay.
- Let's go.

717
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:52,775
Don't grab my wrist...

718
00:36:52,862 --> 00:36:54,168
[grunts]

719
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,519
Oh my god, I am so sorry.

720
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:02,220
No, um... that
was... that was better.

721
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,699
Oh my god.

722
00:37:06,441 --> 00:37:10,184
[birds chirping]

723
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:15,233
[sinister music]

724
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:31,074
[music intensifies]

725
00:37:37,603 --> 00:37:39,169
Billy.

726
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,606
[Paul]: Are you okay?

727
00:37:43,957 --> 00:37:46,351
Stick with me.

728
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:48,135
No...

729
00:37:48,222 --> 00:37:50,703
I want you to see with
your mind and your eyes,

730
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,052
and then your body.

731
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,672
[sinister music]

732
00:38:03,803 --> 00:38:06,414
[Paul]: Take your left
arm, swing it across!

733
00:38:06,545 --> 00:38:09,156
Break the grip.

734
00:38:09,243 --> 00:38:11,593
Get free, run away.

735
00:38:14,596 --> 00:38:17,251
[birds chirping]

736
00:38:20,994 --> 00:38:25,041
Okay, I usually have to
do deep breaths for this,

737
00:38:25,128 --> 00:38:27,043
but this works too.

738
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:30,656
[laughs]

739
00:38:30,786 --> 00:38:33,876
You know...

740
00:38:33,963 --> 00:38:39,621
I never met anyone like
Billy before in my life.

741
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:41,231
I mean, he could
make standing in line

742
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,973
feel like the best date ever.

743
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,758
We married three
months after we met.

744
00:38:45,845 --> 00:38:48,456
- [Paul]: Really?
- Yeah.

745
00:38:48,587 --> 00:38:50,850
In the beginning,
we were so in love.

746
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,112
Unstoppable.

747
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:55,594
You couldn't tell us nothin'.

748
00:38:55,681 --> 00:38:58,205
And then, about a month in,

749
00:38:58,292 --> 00:39:02,688
he had his first
bout with depression.

750
00:39:02,775 --> 00:39:04,603
He was unhappy, and
because he was unhappy,

751
00:39:04,733 --> 00:39:07,170
I had to be unhappy too.

752
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:08,824
I'm sorry.

753
00:39:08,911 --> 00:39:13,176
He knew he had
this control over me.

754
00:39:13,263 --> 00:39:16,528
It was, like,
protective at first.

755
00:39:16,615 --> 00:39:18,660
And then...

756
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:21,271
demeaning.

757
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,319
He was never happy with me.
My hair, my clothes.

758
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:28,714
I wasn't perfect in his eyes.

759
00:39:28,801 --> 00:39:34,633
He let me know it,
and I believed him, too.

760
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,939
You think I'm crazy, huh?

761
00:39:37,026 --> 00:39:39,942
No, I don't think you're crazy.
You loved him.

762
00:39:40,029 --> 00:39:41,553
You wanted to see
the best in him.

763
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,251
Yeah, but then it got worse.

764
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:48,908
You don't have to tell me.

765
00:39:51,606 --> 00:39:54,000
It was all about my art.

766
00:39:54,087 --> 00:39:56,568
He knew how it made me feel.

767
00:39:56,655 --> 00:40:00,006
He even tried to get me
to stop going to art class.

768
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:02,008
But I was determined.

769
00:40:02,095 --> 00:40:03,575
Good.

770
00:40:03,705 --> 00:40:06,882
One night, he was
in the backyard.

771
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:09,929
I came out.

772
00:40:10,016 --> 00:40:13,498
All of my paintings,
he destroyed them.

773
00:40:13,585 --> 00:40:15,238
- What?
- Yeah.

774
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:18,677
Um, when I tried to
regain my balance,

775
00:40:18,764 --> 00:40:21,375
he just knocked me
right back down,

776
00:40:21,506 --> 00:40:26,467
telling me I wasn't
talented, I was a waste.

777
00:40:26,554 --> 00:40:27,729
But I fought back.

778
00:40:27,816 --> 00:40:32,125
I fought toe to toe,
you know, like...

779
00:40:32,212 --> 00:40:34,606
- sticking up for myself.
- As you should.

780
00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:42,701
But then I realized
I couldn't stop him.

781
00:40:44,746 --> 00:40:48,315
And I remember, man.
I remember his face every time.

782
00:40:48,402 --> 00:40:50,709
It was like...

783
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:55,061
Like he was satisfied

784
00:40:55,191 --> 00:40:58,543
with destroying me every time.

785
00:40:59,935 --> 00:41:01,633
And... and then
that's when I knew,

786
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:06,376
if I did not get out,
he would win.

787
00:41:06,507 --> 00:41:10,293
But... I didn't leave.

788
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,905
I stayed.

789
00:41:13,035 --> 00:41:17,823
I stopped... stopped
fighting, just took it...

790
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:21,479
his words.

791
00:41:21,609 --> 00:41:24,090
And then I would
be like, you know,

792
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:27,876
go into, like, a comatose state.

793
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:30,096
Try to disassociate.

794
00:41:30,226 --> 00:41:35,318
I... I know it was a survival
technique at that point,

795
00:41:35,405 --> 00:41:37,059
you know, like playing dead?

796
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,496
Yeah.

797
00:41:40,759 --> 00:41:44,240
To get to that point, to...

798
00:41:44,371 --> 00:41:47,374
to go there...

799
00:41:47,461 --> 00:41:49,768
it killed my spirit.

800
00:41:49,855 --> 00:41:51,596
Did he ever hit you?

801
00:41:51,683 --> 00:41:53,946
No, not until that night.

802
00:41:56,514 --> 00:42:00,430
And now every image of
him is violent, you know?

803
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:04,260
Him grabbing me,
grabbing my wrist,

804
00:42:04,347 --> 00:42:07,176
his hands around my throat.

805
00:42:07,263 --> 00:42:09,396
It's all I see
when I think of him.

806
00:42:12,181 --> 00:42:13,705
But today...

807
00:42:13,835 --> 00:42:17,839
Let me tell you
what I realized today.

808
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,886
On that mat, I realized

809
00:42:20,973 --> 00:42:26,674
that my spirit, this spirit,

810
00:42:26,761 --> 00:42:29,068
has so much more life to live.

811
00:42:30,896 --> 00:42:33,376
And I'm ready to fight back.

812
00:42:33,463 --> 00:42:34,769
Let's do it.

813
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,554
Let's do it!

814
00:42:36,641 --> 00:42:37,729
I'm ready to use this one.

815
00:42:37,816 --> 00:42:38,991
- No!
- Yes!

816
00:42:39,078 --> 00:42:40,253
- Not that one!
- Mm-hmm.

817
00:42:40,383 --> 00:42:41,863
I've had enough of
that one for today.

818
00:42:49,131 --> 00:42:50,524
I feel so good.

819
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:53,919
I feel... strong.

820
00:42:54,049 --> 00:42:56,922
I feel like my energy's up.

821
00:42:57,052 --> 00:42:59,620
Of course, you know, sure I was
a bit awkward in the beginning,

822
00:42:59,707 --> 00:43:02,841
but I know some moves now,

823
00:43:02,971 --> 00:43:06,192
and I'm ready for him
if he's coming for me.

824
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:09,456
- Billy?
- Whoever's coming for me.

825
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:13,025
Okay, warrior queen.

826
00:43:13,155 --> 00:43:15,897
But there's something.

827
00:43:15,984 --> 00:43:17,420
[sighs]

828
00:43:17,507 --> 00:43:19,161
Maybe Billy's coming
at ya from the grave.

829
00:43:19,248 --> 00:43:21,860
What's the matter?
What is it?

830
00:43:21,947 --> 00:43:25,733
I did a deep dive into
your home finances, and...

831
00:43:25,864 --> 00:43:28,170
Billy spent a lot
of money each month.

832
00:43:28,301 --> 00:43:30,999
A lot more than he made.

833
00:43:31,086 --> 00:43:32,871
How is that even possible?

834
00:43:32,958 --> 00:43:34,176
The shade of it all.

835
00:43:34,307 --> 00:43:36,831
He was careful to
cover his tracks.

836
00:43:36,962 --> 00:43:42,402
But obviously, he had
another income stream.

837
00:43:42,489 --> 00:43:44,970
Am I involved in
something illegal?

838
00:43:45,057 --> 00:43:48,843
I'll go through it.
But the good news is...

839
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:52,499
no matter how hard you try to
hide it, money leaves a trail.

840
00:43:52,586 --> 00:43:55,328
The dark always
comes into the light.

841
00:43:58,592 --> 00:44:00,725
[chuckles]

842
00:44:05,991 --> 00:44:08,820
What the hell?
Who covered the paintings?

843
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:10,996
It was him.
I know it was him.

844
00:44:11,126 --> 00:44:12,126
Who?

845
00:44:12,171 --> 00:44:13,781
Billy.

846
00:44:13,868 --> 00:44:15,348
Can you see him?

847
00:44:15,435 --> 00:44:17,089
No, of course not.

848
00:44:18,264 --> 00:44:20,353
Oh my god, the art pieces.

849
00:44:23,356 --> 00:44:25,619
Oh, come on, no.

850
00:44:25,706 --> 00:44:27,752
Please, please, please,
please, please, please...

851
00:44:27,882 --> 00:44:29,754
Okay.

852
00:44:30,711 --> 00:44:31,930
All right, all right.

853
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,714
Please no, please no, please no.

854
00:44:33,801 --> 00:44:35,455
Thank god.

855
00:44:35,542 --> 00:44:37,936
I'm surprised he didn't
destroy this one.

856
00:44:38,066 --> 00:44:39,372
You know what?

857
00:44:39,459 --> 00:44:40,958
We gotta get these
projects outta here.

858
00:44:40,982 --> 00:44:42,525
They're way too important
and they mean so much.

859
00:44:42,549 --> 00:44:44,812
Why are you so
convinced it's him?

860
00:44:44,943 --> 00:44:47,467
Because he always found a
way to diminish what I do.

861
00:44:47,597 --> 00:44:50,035
But he can't do that now.

862
00:44:50,165 --> 00:44:52,428
- Not anymore.
- I know, but...

863
00:44:52,515 --> 00:44:53,647
[Paul]: But he's dead.

864
00:44:55,518 --> 00:44:57,738
He's dead.
Billy is dead.

865
00:44:57,869 --> 00:45:00,436
Don't you think it's
time to accept that?

866
00:45:00,523 --> 00:45:02,830
See, I knew I couldn't
be this person for you.

867
00:45:02,961 --> 00:45:06,921
You... you just have this
idea of me, this picture...

868
00:45:07,052 --> 00:45:08,880
I can't be all bright
and shiny for you.

869
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:10,422
I don't need you to be
bright and shiny, Jules...

870
00:45:10,446 --> 00:45:11,621
[Jules]: You know what?

871
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,536
What are you doing?

872
00:45:16,626 --> 00:45:18,706
- That's what you want?
- No, that's not what I want.

873
00:45:21,022 --> 00:45:22,521
You know what?
Come on, I'm taking you...

874
00:45:22,545 --> 00:45:23,982
[Jules]: I can find
my own way home.

875
00:45:26,462 --> 00:45:28,421
This is who I am, Paul.

876
00:45:30,292 --> 00:45:31,729
And you can't handle it.

877
00:45:35,297 --> 00:45:36,864
You need to go.

878
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:42,130
Leave. Go.

879
00:45:42,261 --> 00:45:46,874
[tense music]

880
00:45:49,398 --> 00:45:51,009
[door shuts]

881
00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:56,797
[birds chirping]

882
00:45:56,928 --> 00:46:02,542
[whirring, dinging]

883
00:46:10,637 --> 00:46:12,247
What is that?

884
00:46:14,162 --> 00:46:16,469
Oh man, come on.

885
00:46:21,735 --> 00:46:23,606
Damn boys.

886
00:46:25,434 --> 00:46:28,742
[whirring, dinging]

887
00:46:30,178 --> 00:46:34,792
[tense music]

888
00:46:36,706 --> 00:46:41,494
[whirring, dinging louder]

889
00:46:45,019 --> 00:46:50,503
[tense music]

890
00:46:56,552 --> 00:46:59,512
[whirring louder]

891
00:47:15,876 --> 00:47:17,835
[whirring stops]

892
00:47:17,965 --> 00:47:19,358
[Billy]: [whispers] Jules.

893
00:47:21,012 --> 00:47:25,625
[dinging continues]

894
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:29,368
Billy?

895
00:47:31,674 --> 00:47:37,028
[music intensifies]

896
00:47:37,115 --> 00:47:39,508
[loud thumping]

897
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:41,554
Billy!

898
00:47:41,684 --> 00:47:43,338
[screams]

899
00:47:43,469 --> 00:47:44,992
Don't stab me, I just... I just...

900
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:47,168
Naomi!

901
00:47:47,255 --> 00:47:48,561
Sorry, I thought that,

902
00:47:48,691 --> 00:47:49,605
just with everything that
you're going through,

903
00:47:49,692 --> 00:47:50,868
it might be a nice gesture.

904
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,522
What is...

905
00:47:53,653 --> 00:47:56,786
[Jules]: Did you see anyone?

906
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,136
Did you see anybody?

907
00:47:58,223 --> 00:47:59,528
What?

908
00:47:59,659 --> 00:48:01,071
Did you see anyone
outside my window?

909
00:48:01,095 --> 00:48:02,618
No, no, there's no one out here.

910
00:48:02,749 --> 00:48:04,011
What...

911
00:48:04,142 --> 00:48:05,883
What is going on?

912
00:48:07,275 --> 00:48:11,062
[up-tempo music]

913
00:48:11,192 --> 00:48:14,892
I'm sorry, Naomi, I gotta
get the hell outta here.

914
00:48:14,979 --> 00:48:17,895
Kenny, change the locks.
I'll explain later.

915
00:48:22,421 --> 00:48:26,164
[up-tempo music]

916
00:48:30,168 --> 00:48:32,735
[phone ringing]

917
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:37,392
[beep]

918
00:48:37,523 --> 00:48:39,394
Dana, it's... it's Jules.

919
00:48:39,481 --> 00:48:41,222
I need you to meet
me at our spot.

920
00:48:41,309 --> 00:48:43,181
I'm really freaking
out right now.

921
00:48:45,618 --> 00:48:48,360
[birds chirping]

922
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:53,060
[tense music]

923
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,936
[ghostly whisperings]

924
00:49:03,157 --> 00:49:04,898
- Jules!
- [screams]

925
00:49:04,985 --> 00:49:09,163
It's me, are you okay?

926
00:49:09,294 --> 00:49:11,687
I saw Billy.

927
00:49:11,818 --> 00:49:14,081
You're scaring me.

928
00:49:14,168 --> 00:49:15,604
He was there.

929
00:49:15,691 --> 00:49:18,042
There was this...

930
00:49:18,129 --> 00:49:21,262
This one time, he got
really angry about dinner

931
00:49:21,393 --> 00:49:26,137
and he... he put all the food
in the garbage disposal

932
00:49:26,224 --> 00:49:29,531
and let it run all night long,
and it just made this sound.

933
00:49:29,618 --> 00:49:32,099
Clunk, clunk,
clunk, clunk all night.

934
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:33,230
And I heard it.

935
00:49:33,274 --> 00:49:34,493
You're not making any sense.

936
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:36,930
Why don't you believe me?

937
00:49:37,061 --> 00:49:38,366
You have to sleep.

938
00:49:38,453 --> 00:49:39,453
No.

939
00:49:39,541 --> 00:49:41,935
You have to stop.
He's dead.

940
00:49:42,022 --> 00:49:45,678
No, he is coming for me.

941
00:49:45,808 --> 00:49:47,593
They found his body.

942
00:49:47,723 --> 00:49:51,031
We went to his funeral.

943
00:49:51,162 --> 00:49:53,816
- He's gone.
- He's coming for me.

944
00:50:02,434 --> 00:50:04,610
[Jules]: Look, I know this
is gonna sound crazy, but...

945
00:50:04,697 --> 00:50:05,872
[Lawyer]: I'm a lawyer!

946
00:50:05,959 --> 00:50:08,570
I'm used to crazy.

947
00:50:08,701 --> 00:50:11,269
I need you to file for
a new restraining order.

948
00:50:11,399 --> 00:50:13,053
Against your ex-husband?

949
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,359
He's harassing me!

950
00:50:14,446 --> 00:50:16,796
He's dead! Jules!

951
00:50:16,883 --> 00:50:20,234
I told you, he tampered with
my home, with my appliances.

952
00:50:20,365 --> 00:50:21,714
And I...

953
00:50:21,801 --> 00:50:23,455
I think that he
killed my therapist.

954
00:50:23,585 --> 00:50:25,196
Do you have any proof?

955
00:50:25,283 --> 00:50:26,458
[Dana]: I'm here.

956
00:50:26,545 --> 00:50:28,677
Oh, fantastic.

957
00:50:28,764 --> 00:50:33,117
Um, Jules was just filling
me in on how her ex-husband,

958
00:50:33,204 --> 00:50:36,337
her dead husband, is,
uh, harassing her.

959
00:50:36,424 --> 00:50:37,599
What have you got?

960
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,471
She's not far off.

961
00:50:39,601 --> 00:50:42,126
You're not gonna believe this.

962
00:50:42,213 --> 00:50:46,173
Jules, do you have any idea how
much money you and Billy had?

963
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,436
Not to the penny, but...

964
00:50:48,567 --> 00:50:50,308
I mean, we had
joint checking account

965
00:50:50,395 --> 00:50:51,961
and a little bit of savings.

966
00:50:52,092 --> 00:50:54,660
Well, I found a
bit more than that.

967
00:50:54,747 --> 00:50:56,618
How much more?

968
00:50:56,749 --> 00:51:00,187
$10 million in hidden,
undisclosed accounts.

969
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:04,670
$10 mil... no, that's impossible.

970
00:51:04,757 --> 00:51:07,064
Billy's firm did a lot
of business involving

971
00:51:07,194 --> 00:51:09,631
local city zoning
and real estate loans.

972
00:51:09,762 --> 00:51:11,602
It's entirely plausible
he was embezzling money

973
00:51:11,677 --> 00:51:13,809
and had been for years.

974
00:51:13,896 --> 00:51:15,507
But these accounts,

975
00:51:15,637 --> 00:51:18,727
they've shown activity
over the last two months.

976
00:51:18,814 --> 00:51:20,816
Well, that proves he's alive.

977
00:51:20,903 --> 00:51:22,079
No.

978
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:24,211
All the transactions
were done by you.

979
00:51:24,298 --> 00:51:25,517
Me? I don't even...

980
00:51:25,604 --> 00:51:27,345
No, not you you.

981
00:51:27,432 --> 00:51:29,390
But a login with your name.

982
00:51:29,477 --> 00:51:31,523
He wanted you to have access.

983
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:34,003
He wanted it to
look like motive.

984
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,484
He must have a partner.

985
00:51:36,571 --> 00:51:39,487
How is this even possible?

986
00:51:39,574 --> 00:51:43,796
The divorce proceedings,
all assets split 50-50.

987
00:51:43,883 --> 00:51:46,103
It would've uncovered this.

988
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:47,887
[Dana]: He didn't want that.

989
00:51:47,974 --> 00:51:50,324
But now that he's dead,
you own all the business.

990
00:51:50,455 --> 00:51:52,805
Therefore, you have a
right to these accounts.

991
00:51:52,935 --> 00:51:56,852
You've assumed them all
for better or for worse.

992
00:51:56,939 --> 00:52:00,813
Everything points to you.

993
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:03,076
Still has his hands on me.

994
00:52:03,163 --> 00:52:04,773
Even in death.

995
00:52:08,995 --> 00:52:14,435
[gentle, bright music]

996
00:52:38,807 --> 00:52:41,245
It's not very good.

997
00:52:41,375 --> 00:52:44,726
Art is subjective.

998
00:52:44,857 --> 00:52:47,903
Or it could just be bad.

999
00:52:48,034 --> 00:52:51,907
It's all about taking
that pain that's in here

1000
00:52:51,994 --> 00:52:55,911
and getting it all
out on that canvas.

1001
00:52:56,042 --> 00:52:59,045
Yeah, I'm gonna need
a few more canvasses.

1002
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,699
Me too.

1003
00:53:02,788 --> 00:53:04,703
Maybe try some shading in here.

1004
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:15,279
Hey.

1005
00:53:15,409 --> 00:53:17,368
[Dana]: You okay?

1006
00:53:17,498 --> 00:53:19,152
Surviving.

1007
00:53:19,283 --> 00:53:21,067
Your house is almost done.

1008
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,547
You need to put
it on the market.

1009
00:53:22,634 --> 00:53:24,331
It's messing with your head.

1010
00:53:24,462 --> 00:53:25,898
It's not gonna help.

1011
00:53:25,985 --> 00:53:28,335
He's just gonna follow me.

1012
00:53:28,466 --> 00:53:29,660
You know, when Billy was alive,

1013
00:53:29,684 --> 00:53:31,512
he would do little
things like this.

1014
00:53:31,643 --> 00:53:34,211
Let me know that
he was watching.

1015
00:53:34,298 --> 00:53:36,648
That he was in control.

1016
00:53:36,778 --> 00:53:40,695
I mean, how else do you
explain the disposal?

1017
00:53:40,782 --> 00:53:43,132
My refrigerator door?

1018
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:46,179
Everything that you
told me earlier,

1019
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:48,355
he's back terrorizing me again.

1020
00:53:48,486 --> 00:53:50,575
But Billy is not
terrorizing you.

1021
00:53:50,662 --> 00:53:53,360
Not physically.

1022
00:53:53,447 --> 00:53:54,883
You need to get
out of that house.

1023
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:57,016
The sooner, the better.

1024
00:53:57,103 --> 00:54:00,411
[tense music]

1025
00:54:07,113 --> 00:54:11,335
[music grows sinister]

1026
00:54:13,424 --> 00:54:14,338
[screams]

1027
00:54:14,425 --> 00:54:15,904
Oh!

1028
00:54:16,035 --> 00:54:17,689
It's Paul.

1029
00:54:17,776 --> 00:54:19,691
Jules's Paul?

1030
00:54:19,821 --> 00:54:21,519
Uh, well, no, no.

1031
00:54:21,649 --> 00:54:22,998
I tried to be.

1032
00:54:23,129 --> 00:54:24,435
I know you did.

1033
00:54:24,522 --> 00:54:26,350
I wanna be there for her.

1034
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,787
Our girl's not doing so well.

1035
00:54:28,917 --> 00:54:32,356
This... what's happening
may all be in her head,

1036
00:54:32,443 --> 00:54:34,140
but she believes it.

1037
00:54:34,227 --> 00:54:35,968
You've seen her.

1038
00:54:36,098 --> 00:54:38,449
Maybe...

1039
00:54:38,536 --> 00:54:40,407
Maybe I can keep an eye on her.

1040
00:54:40,494 --> 00:54:44,411
Paul, she already thinks
a man is watching her.

1041
00:54:44,498 --> 00:54:46,108
Maybe she's not ready.

1042
00:54:46,195 --> 00:54:47,762
Let's give her some time?

1043
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:53,377
Apparently, being patient is
my most annoying quality, so...

1044
00:54:53,464 --> 00:54:56,641
Yeah, she can take as
much time as she wants.

1045
00:54:56,728 --> 00:54:58,860
I'll be here.
Hey, have a good day.

1046
00:54:58,991 --> 00:55:01,167
- It was nice meeting you.
- You too.

1047
00:55:10,176 --> 00:55:13,962
[tense music]

1048
00:55:15,616 --> 00:55:18,489
[birds chirping]

1049
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:20,708
What are you saying, dear?

1050
00:55:20,795 --> 00:55:23,885
I do miss you.

1051
00:55:23,972 --> 00:55:27,324
When you left him,
you left me as well.

1052
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:30,979
Now that Billy's
gone, I'm alone.

1053
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:33,460
That's what I wanted
to ask you about.

1054
00:55:33,591 --> 00:55:35,854
Do you see anyone else?

1055
00:55:35,941 --> 00:55:39,031
I guess I see the
people at the club.

1056
00:55:39,161 --> 00:55:41,001
And I do have my standing
Arts Council meetings

1057
00:55:41,033 --> 00:55:42,774
every Wednesday.

1058
00:55:42,904 --> 00:55:44,384
That sounds nice.

1059
00:55:44,471 --> 00:55:46,517
Yes, my life is very full.

1060
00:55:47,605 --> 00:55:49,215
Listen, I know it's hard.

1061
00:55:49,302 --> 00:55:52,174
You will never understand.

1062
00:55:52,261 --> 00:55:53,480
A mother's love is as...

1063
00:55:53,567 --> 00:55:58,572
I loved Billy too, once.

1064
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:00,357
No matter what my boy did,

1065
00:56:00,487 --> 00:56:02,794
I could never take
him from this world.

1066
00:56:02,924 --> 00:56:04,796
He tried to take me out.

1067
00:56:04,926 --> 00:56:06,493
I left before he could...

1068
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:09,583
Look, I didn't come here
to conflict with you.

1069
00:56:09,714 --> 00:56:12,499
It's just...

1070
00:56:12,586 --> 00:56:14,632
I keep seeing him.

1071
00:56:14,762 --> 00:56:17,243
I know what you mean.

1072
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,463
You do?

1073
00:56:19,593 --> 00:56:21,813
Grief is tricky.

1074
00:56:21,943 --> 00:56:23,815
Makes you see things.

1075
00:56:23,902 --> 00:56:25,251
The people you love.

1076
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,383
You saw him?

1077
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:28,123
Just the other day, I was...

1078
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:31,823
I was leaving the
post office, you know,

1079
00:56:31,953 --> 00:56:33,607
the one downtown near
Billy's old office.

1080
00:56:33,738 --> 00:56:36,523
And when I look
towards the building...

1081
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:38,873
You saw him outside
of his office?

1082
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,503
But what was he doing?
Where was he going?

1083
00:56:40,527 --> 00:56:42,094
He wasn't really there, dear.

1084
00:56:42,224 --> 00:56:45,793
I did a double take,
and he was gone.

1085
00:56:45,924 --> 00:56:48,187
It's just grief.

1086
00:56:48,274 --> 00:56:50,102
And wishful thinking.

1087
00:56:52,844 --> 00:56:54,715
You didn't set that fire.

1088
00:56:54,846 --> 00:56:56,325
You didn't kill my Billy.

1089
00:56:56,456 --> 00:56:58,980
Of course not.

1090
00:56:59,111 --> 00:57:01,983
The police came here.

1091
00:57:02,114 --> 00:57:04,725
And they asked me.

1092
00:57:04,812 --> 00:57:08,120
But frankly, I told them

1093
00:57:08,207 --> 00:57:11,123
you didn't have it in you.

1094
00:57:11,253 --> 00:57:13,342
You're not a strong
woman, Jules.

1095
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:16,781
You couldn't handle
him the way I did.

1096
00:57:16,911 --> 00:57:19,479
Every day, I've got
to live with this.

1097
00:57:19,566 --> 00:57:21,916
Billy's dead.

1098
00:57:22,003 --> 00:57:24,876
I'm not so sure he is.

1099
00:57:24,963 --> 00:57:26,878
What are you talking about?

1100
00:57:26,965 --> 00:57:29,837
It's just I...

1101
00:57:29,924 --> 00:57:31,752
I keep seeing him.

1102
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:34,712
No, you don't.

1103
00:57:34,842 --> 00:57:39,238
Do you think that Billy
would ever fake his death?

1104
00:57:39,368 --> 00:57:41,022
For what? For what purpose?

1105
00:57:41,153 --> 00:57:44,983
I don't know, maybe
to get... get back at me.

1106
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:47,464
Selfish girl!

1107
00:57:47,551 --> 00:57:50,075
What a horrible suggestion!

1108
00:57:50,205 --> 00:57:52,643
You two had issues.

1109
00:57:52,773 --> 00:57:57,909
But my boy would never shadow
my very existence on purpose.

1110
00:57:58,039 --> 00:57:59,999
He would never put his
mother through all of this.

1111
00:58:00,128 --> 00:58:01,826
This is not what I...

1112
00:58:01,913 --> 00:58:03,697
You know what?
I think you need to leave.

1113
00:58:03,784 --> 00:58:06,265
Come back here,
you making up stories?

1114
00:58:06,352 --> 00:58:10,008
So my heart could just
break all over again?

1115
00:58:10,138 --> 00:58:12,750
Get back at me for
what he did to you.

1116
00:58:12,837 --> 00:58:13,968
Maybe I was wrong about you.

1117
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:18,190
You are... you are cruel.

1118
00:58:18,277 --> 00:58:19,931
You need to leave, please.

1119
00:58:20,018 --> 00:58:21,367
Please, just leave.

1120
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:22,498
That's not what I...

1121
00:58:22,542 --> 00:58:24,196
Leave!

1122
00:58:28,243 --> 00:58:29,593
[Dana]: You know she's innocent.

1123
00:58:29,723 --> 00:58:31,484
[Walker]: I am following
the facts of the case.

1124
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:32,788
The info the lawyer
sent, though,

1125
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,902
will show she has access
to certain accounts,

1126
00:58:34,989 --> 00:58:36,227
and that does not
help her case at all.

1127
00:58:36,251 --> 00:58:37,426
It speaks to motive.

1128
00:58:37,557 --> 00:58:40,908
Billy must have had a partner.

1129
00:58:40,995 --> 00:58:43,041
You wanna be a good friend.
I understand that.

1130
00:58:43,171 --> 00:58:45,565
But this does not
look good for Ms. Baker.

1131
00:58:45,652 --> 00:58:48,481
I'm worried about her, what this
is doing to her mental state.

1132
00:58:48,568 --> 00:58:49,787
She should see somebody.

1133
00:58:49,917 --> 00:58:51,615
She can't. He's dead.

1134
00:58:52,877 --> 00:58:55,140
Listen, I love her.

1135
00:58:55,227 --> 00:58:57,316
But she is losing her grip.

1136
00:58:57,446 --> 00:58:59,274
I know you have to do your job.

1137
00:58:59,405 --> 00:59:01,320
But sister to sister?

1138
00:59:01,407 --> 00:59:04,541
Can you just keep an eye on her?

1139
00:59:04,628 --> 00:59:05,977
Please.

1140
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:11,983
[sighs]

1141
00:59:13,985 --> 00:59:18,555
[maudlin music]

1142
00:59:32,177 --> 00:59:33,744
All right.

1143
00:59:43,536 --> 00:59:46,495
That's it.

1144
00:59:46,626 --> 00:59:49,586
Okay.

1145
00:59:49,673 --> 00:59:50,978
Enough is enough.

1146
00:59:51,109 --> 00:59:53,720
Let's put some light
back into this.

1147
00:59:53,807 --> 00:59:55,940
Let's see if I can get this off.

1148
00:59:57,376 --> 01:00:03,077
[clinging]

1149
01:00:06,298 --> 01:00:07,865
- Boo!
- [gasps]

1150
01:00:10,824 --> 01:00:11,824
Billy?

1151
01:00:18,136 --> 01:00:20,138
Billy?

1152
01:00:20,268 --> 01:00:23,794
Hello, love.

1153
01:00:23,924 --> 01:00:25,317
- Can...
- [Billy]: I am.

1154
01:00:27,928 --> 01:00:29,297
- I'm calling the police.
- [Billy]: Good idea.

1155
01:00:29,321 --> 01:00:33,325
Too bad they think
you already killed me.

1156
01:00:33,412 --> 01:00:36,937
We had such a good
thing going on, baby.

1157
01:00:37,068 --> 01:00:40,114
Until you ruined it.

1158
01:00:40,245 --> 01:00:41,899
Two years, that's all I needed.

1159
01:00:41,986 --> 01:00:45,206
Then we could've retired to the
Caribbean on a little island.

1160
01:00:45,337 --> 01:00:48,601
Rum punch and
sunshine every day.

1161
01:00:48,688 --> 01:00:54,389
Just the two of us,
happily ever after.

1162
01:00:54,476 --> 01:00:56,653
Till death do us part.

1163
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,267
But you broke that vow.

1164
01:01:06,097 --> 01:01:07,751
Ended when I saw you
with that lawyer.

1165
01:01:09,448 --> 01:01:11,319
But you couldn't figure out
what I was up to.

1166
01:01:11,406 --> 01:01:14,671
And I begged you not to go
through with that divorce,

1167
01:01:14,758 --> 01:01:15,846
but did you listen to me?

1168
01:01:15,933 --> 01:01:17,586
No.

1169
01:01:17,717 --> 01:01:20,154
You never do.

1170
01:01:20,241 --> 01:01:23,201
People go to prison
for what I did,

1171
01:01:23,288 --> 01:01:25,682
and I wasn't going
to let that happen.

1172
01:01:27,596 --> 01:01:29,598
Go ahead.

1173
01:01:29,729 --> 01:01:32,384
Say it.

1174
01:01:32,471 --> 01:01:35,213
Fake your own death.

1175
01:01:36,736 --> 01:01:38,216
[gasps]

1176
01:01:38,346 --> 01:01:39,870
[laughs]

1177
01:01:39,957 --> 01:01:42,611
Look at us, look at us,
Billy and Jules.

1178
01:01:42,742 --> 01:01:45,876
Together again,
just like old times.

1179
01:01:48,443 --> 01:01:51,838
[phone ringing]

1180
01:01:51,925 --> 01:01:53,927
[Billy]: Maybe that's
your new Romeo.

1181
01:01:54,014 --> 01:01:55,513
- Why don't you get it?
- You leave him alone.

1182
01:01:55,537 --> 01:01:57,278
This is between me and you.

1183
01:01:57,409 --> 01:01:59,585
[phone ringing]

1184
01:02:01,456 --> 01:02:04,459
Jules, uh, it... it's Paul.

1185
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:06,505
Look, I hate the
way we ended things.

1186
01:02:06,592 --> 01:02:09,900
I'm gonna stop by the studio
and see if you're painting late.

1187
01:02:09,987 --> 01:02:11,249
I'll see you soon, bye.

1188
01:02:14,034 --> 01:02:16,689
Who died in that fire, Billy?
'Cause we know it wasn't you.

1189
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:20,214
John Franklin ring a bell?

1190
01:02:20,301 --> 01:02:22,695
The homeless guy
from your office?

1191
01:02:22,826 --> 01:02:26,133
Yeah, I know, a collision
of wants and needs.

1192
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:28,440
He wanted a place to stay,

1193
01:02:28,527 --> 01:02:32,270
and I needed a body
no one would miss.

1194
01:02:32,357 --> 01:02:33,401
You're a blood...

1195
01:02:33,532 --> 01:02:35,490
No, you made me like this!

1196
01:02:35,621 --> 01:02:39,233
I didn't want to
hurt anyone, Jules,

1197
01:02:39,364 --> 01:02:43,629
but you kept pushing me
and pushing me and pushing me.

1198
01:02:45,805 --> 01:02:47,981
What happened to Ron?

1199
01:02:48,068 --> 01:02:49,853
Ron ran into a car.

1200
01:02:52,725 --> 01:02:55,684
You're a very
dangerous person, too.

1201
01:02:55,815 --> 01:02:57,730
You killed him.

1202
01:02:57,861 --> 01:03:01,647
And you will for always
and forever be mine.

1203
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:02,691
Mm, no.

1204
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,955
Yes.

1205
01:03:10,177 --> 01:03:11,657
No!

1206
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,181
Help!

1207
01:03:14,268 --> 01:03:16,357
Help me!

1208
01:03:16,444 --> 01:03:18,490
Jules, what's wrong?

1209
01:03:18,577 --> 01:03:20,884
Aah, someone help me!

1210
01:03:20,971 --> 01:03:22,842
Hey, hey, what's wrong?

1211
01:03:22,929 --> 01:03:24,801
It was him. He was here!

1212
01:03:24,931 --> 01:03:26,672
No, who, who, what happened?

1213
01:03:26,759 --> 01:03:28,152
Billy, he was here.

1214
01:03:28,282 --> 01:03:31,068
[sobs]

1215
01:03:31,155 --> 01:03:32,765
We gotta go to
the police because

1216
01:03:32,852 --> 01:03:34,264
they think that I killed
him and he's alive.

1217
01:03:34,288 --> 01:03:36,987
I swear to god he's alive.

1218
01:03:37,117 --> 01:03:41,730
Shh, it's okay, it's okay.

1219
01:03:41,861 --> 01:03:45,169
[sobs]

1220
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,781
[door opens]

1221
01:03:49,913 --> 01:03:51,523
Detective Walker.

1222
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:53,351
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's going on here?

1223
01:03:53,438 --> 01:03:54,961
- He was here.
- Who?

1224
01:03:55,092 --> 01:03:57,132
My ex-husband, he... he was
here and he threatened me.

1225
01:03:57,181 --> 01:03:59,618
He's alive
and he's still out there.

1226
01:03:59,705 --> 01:04:00,967
Did you see him?

1227
01:04:01,054 --> 01:04:02,379
No, I heard her scream
and I ran inside.

1228
01:04:02,403 --> 01:04:04,014
Did you see Mr. Moss?

1229
01:04:05,015 --> 01:04:06,668
No.

1230
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:08,148
Let's just calm down, okay?

1231
01:04:08,235 --> 01:04:09,865
So we can really figure out
what's going on here?

1232
01:04:09,889 --> 01:04:11,891
Why are you here?

1233
01:04:11,978 --> 01:04:14,372
Oh, your friend, Dana.

1234
01:04:14,459 --> 01:04:16,069
There's new evidence
that your husband

1235
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,637
may have been involved
in illegal activity.

1236
01:04:18,724 --> 01:04:20,769
Well, good, then you
can arrest him then.

1237
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,859
Yeah, not in the habit
of arresting dead people,

1238
01:04:22,989 --> 01:04:25,774
but this might help your case.

1239
01:04:25,905 --> 01:04:28,038
And what if he shows up
again and I'm not here?

1240
01:04:28,125 --> 01:04:30,388
Well, you... you know what?

1241
01:04:30,475 --> 01:04:32,869
If it's her husband,
call the media.

1242
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,399
I got something to tell you.

1243
01:04:42,574 --> 01:04:44,576
Billy came to my studio.

1244
01:04:46,534 --> 01:04:48,058
- Jules.
- I'm not imagining this.

1245
01:04:48,145 --> 01:04:50,625
I just need you to
please believe me.

1246
01:04:50,756 --> 01:04:52,671
Okay.

1247
01:04:52,758 --> 01:04:54,891
But real talk?

1248
01:04:54,978 --> 01:04:57,110
The only way you're
gonna get rid of Billy

1249
01:04:57,197 --> 01:05:00,157
is to get everything
having to do with him out.

1250
01:05:00,244 --> 01:05:03,203
This house, the finances...

1251
01:05:03,290 --> 01:05:05,771
You haven't touched his office.

1252
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:07,425
We're gonna get
you through this.

1253
01:05:09,166 --> 01:05:12,865
And then you can say
goodbye to Billy forever.

1254
01:05:12,952 --> 01:05:14,649
Yeah, but I...

1255
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:16,086
I just need proof.

1256
01:05:16,173 --> 01:05:17,739
I need something to
convince the police

1257
01:05:17,826 --> 01:05:20,003
that Billy's behind this.

1258
01:05:20,133 --> 01:05:22,135
Well, let me help you.

1259
01:05:22,266 --> 01:05:25,008
Let me go close up his office,
see if there's something there.

1260
01:05:25,095 --> 01:05:28,185
No, no, I cannot
let you do that.

1261
01:05:28,272 --> 01:05:31,797
He's only gonna use you to
hurt me like he did with Ron.

1262
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,799
Promise me you
won't get involved.

1263
01:05:35,583 --> 01:05:36,715
Promise.

1264
01:05:37,977 --> 01:05:39,587
Promise.

1265
01:05:40,893 --> 01:05:43,113
This coffee is not gonna do it.
I'll be right back.

1266
01:05:44,636 --> 01:05:50,903
[tense music]

1267
01:06:01,479 --> 01:06:06,658
[tense music]

1268
01:06:11,271 --> 01:06:14,579
All right, Dana, you're gonna
go into the dead man's office,

1269
01:06:14,709 --> 01:06:17,277
get the dead man's records,
then get the hell out.

1270
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:30,334
Whoo!

1271
01:06:31,726 --> 01:06:33,946
There's nothing to be scared of.

1272
01:06:34,033 --> 01:06:35,730
You're alive.

1273
01:06:35,817 --> 01:06:39,647
No, I'm not.

1274
01:06:39,778 --> 01:06:45,392
My wife killed me and now I see
you're doing her dirty work.

1275
01:06:45,479 --> 01:06:47,786
Damn, Billy.

1276
01:06:47,873 --> 01:06:49,875
You had us all snowed.

1277
01:06:49,962 --> 01:06:52,008
Me included.

1278
01:06:52,095 --> 01:06:54,097
We thought you were her savior.

1279
01:06:54,184 --> 01:06:56,403
But you are nothing but a crook.

1280
01:06:56,534 --> 01:06:59,450
And I can prove it.

1281
01:06:59,537 --> 01:07:01,060
I want her back.

1282
01:07:01,147 --> 01:07:03,236
You have a funny
way of showing it.

1283
01:07:03,367 --> 01:07:05,151
And she wants to
come back to me too.

1284
01:07:05,238 --> 01:07:07,501
Wait, now that's the funny part.

1285
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:12,593
Jules trusted you.

1286
01:07:12,724 --> 01:07:14,441
She believed you.
She called you her best friend.

1287
01:07:14,465 --> 01:07:15,814
You... you must...

1288
01:07:15,901 --> 01:07:17,903
I never told her to divorce you.

1289
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:24,344
You know, I actually
believe you.

1290
01:07:24,431 --> 01:07:26,042
I don't care.

1291
01:07:28,566 --> 01:07:30,916
I love Jules.

1292
01:07:31,003 --> 01:07:34,615
I really don't give
a damn about you.

1293
01:07:34,746 --> 01:07:36,922
If you leave, and I
mean leave for good,

1294
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:38,967
I'll tell Jules to hold
off for a few months.

1295
01:07:39,098 --> 01:07:42,667
After that, all bets are off.

1296
01:07:42,754 --> 01:07:44,756
You better be gone gone.

1297
01:07:45,626 --> 01:07:47,367
It sounds better.

1298
01:07:50,936 --> 01:07:55,071
Alive or dead, you're a dick.

1299
01:08:07,822 --> 01:08:11,174
[screams, groans]

1300
01:08:13,132 --> 01:08:18,094
[sinister music]

1301
01:08:30,367 --> 01:08:32,108
No, no!

1302
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:36,242
No, no, no.

1303
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:38,549
Dana!

1304
01:08:38,636 --> 01:08:40,333
[sobs]

1305
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:43,902
Oh my god, oh my god,
oh my god, oh my god...

1306
01:08:48,819 --> 01:08:51,127
Uh, Detective Walker?

1307
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:53,999
Oh, Ms. Baker, now
who's following who?

1308
01:08:54,085 --> 01:08:55,696
Can I talk to you?

1309
01:08:55,827 --> 01:08:59,091
Please.

1310
01:08:59,178 --> 01:09:01,137
I just came from my
best friend's funeral.

1311
01:09:02,616 --> 01:09:04,051
[sighs]

1312
01:09:04,139 --> 01:09:05,663
All right, come on.

1313
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:13,627
You told me to come to you
if I had anything to...

1314
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:19,764
My best friend,
Dana, she saw Billy.

1315
01:09:19,851 --> 01:09:22,419
She texted me.

1316
01:09:22,505 --> 01:09:24,160
And now she's dead.

1317
01:09:27,728 --> 01:09:29,556
And you think this
was a homicide.

1318
01:09:29,687 --> 01:09:30,905
I know!

1319
01:09:31,036 --> 01:09:32,231
Yeah, well,
I'm not quite following.

1320
01:09:32,255 --> 01:09:34,779
Billy killed her.

1321
01:09:34,908 --> 01:09:37,129
Okay, wait, whoa, okay.

1322
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:39,305
Let me get this straight.

1323
01:09:39,392 --> 01:09:41,916
So you're saying
that Billy Moss,

1324
01:09:42,047 --> 01:09:44,615
the man that we believe is dead,

1325
01:09:44,745 --> 01:09:46,269
is not only alive,

1326
01:09:46,398 --> 01:09:49,576
but he also murdered Dana Marks.

1327
01:09:49,663 --> 01:09:52,274
- Yes.
- Why would he do that?

1328
01:09:52,405 --> 01:09:53,885
What would be his motivation?

1329
01:09:54,014 --> 01:09:55,495
To hurt me.

1330
01:09:55,582 --> 01:09:57,671
To control me.

1331
01:09:57,802 --> 01:09:59,195
Throughout our entire marriage,

1332
01:09:59,282 --> 01:10:02,154
he was not okay
unless I was scared.

1333
01:10:02,285 --> 01:10:05,157
And through most of our
marriage, I was terrified.

1334
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:08,856
I saw your reports.

1335
01:10:08,943 --> 01:10:10,747
It's hard to prove the
kind of abuse you suffered,

1336
01:10:10,771 --> 01:10:12,077
but I can tell.

1337
01:10:13,557 --> 01:10:16,037
Your husband was an asshole.

1338
01:10:16,168 --> 01:10:17,648
You believe me, the reports?

1339
01:10:17,735 --> 01:10:20,737
Because the other detectives,
they... they didn't.

1340
01:10:20,825 --> 01:10:22,087
According to the reports,

1341
01:10:22,174 --> 01:10:23,871
you were unwilling
to leave Mr. Moss.

1342
01:10:24,002 --> 01:10:27,223
I was scared to leave him.

1343
01:10:27,309 --> 01:10:30,356
Wish I had the guts
to kill him then.

1344
01:10:30,443 --> 01:10:33,316
You're asking me to swallow
a lot of conjecture.

1345
01:10:33,403 --> 01:10:34,752
They found his body.

1346
01:10:34,839 --> 01:10:37,145
They found a body.

1347
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,583
Yes, I saw the text.

1348
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:42,063
But do you have any more?

1349
01:10:43,761 --> 01:10:46,677
Right now, the evidence
fits opposing stories...

1350
01:10:46,764 --> 01:10:49,853
The theory of the
ex-wife seeking revenge

1351
01:10:49,941 --> 01:10:52,857
and yours, the
abusive ex-husband

1352
01:10:52,943 --> 01:10:55,860
who fakes his own death.

1353
01:10:55,947 --> 01:10:58,166
- What does that mean?
- It means

1354
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:01,169
there's not enough
evidence for either.

1355
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,868
You have to
understand something.

1356
01:11:03,998 --> 01:11:07,567
My superiors will never
authorize an investigation

1357
01:11:07,698 --> 01:11:09,960
to look for a man
they think is dead.

1358
01:11:12,093 --> 01:11:14,400
Oh.

1359
01:11:14,531 --> 01:11:17,055
I appreciate you taking the
time to at least hear me out.

1360
01:11:17,142 --> 01:11:22,234
Look, I've been doing this
job too damn long not to know

1361
01:11:22,365 --> 01:11:24,802
that anybody can do anything
under the right circumstances.

1362
01:11:24,889 --> 01:11:29,459
But I think you are the least
likely murderer I have ever met.

1363
01:11:34,246 --> 01:11:36,422
Thank you.

1364
01:11:36,509 --> 01:11:39,207
Be careful, Ms. Baker.

1365
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:40,861
Yes.

1366
01:11:40,948 --> 01:11:45,823
[suspenseful music]

1367
01:11:52,351 --> 01:11:53,787
I need to exhume a body.

1368
01:11:58,401 --> 01:12:00,664
No, I'm not kidding.
When have you ever heard me kid?

1369
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:07,932
[birds chirping]

1370
01:12:11,762 --> 01:12:13,894
You should eat.

1371
01:12:14,025 --> 01:12:17,245
She's dead 'cause of me.

1372
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:20,510
Jules, don't blame yourself.

1373
01:12:20,597 --> 01:12:23,904
And she was trying to help
me, trying to find Billy.

1374
01:12:24,035 --> 01:12:27,081
Billy did this, not you.

1375
01:12:27,168 --> 01:12:29,300
You're not responsible.

1376
01:12:29,388 --> 01:12:31,216
Did you just say
"Billy did this"?

1377
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:32,696
Yes.

1378
01:12:34,785 --> 01:12:37,614
You believe me?

1379
01:12:37,744 --> 01:12:41,661
Of course I believe you.

1380
01:12:41,748 --> 01:12:43,315
Thanks.

1381
01:12:45,621 --> 01:12:48,625
Dana, she asked me if
she could help look for him,

1382
01:12:48,755 --> 01:12:51,148
and I told her not to,
but she just didn't listen.

1383
01:12:51,236 --> 01:12:55,371
[gentle music]

1384
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,202
Well, you can't let Billy win.

1385
01:13:04,335 --> 01:13:07,077
[music turns tense]

1386
01:13:07,165 --> 01:13:09,036
[Naomi]: Abby,
sweetheart, where are you?

1387
01:13:09,123 --> 01:13:10,864
Abby?

1388
01:13:12,562 --> 01:13:14,433
My dad used to take me
and my brother fishing.

1389
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,130
He said the best
way to catch a fish

1390
01:13:16,217 --> 01:13:19,003
is to use the bait
that it likes.

1391
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:21,179
I don't follow.

1392
01:13:21,309 --> 01:13:24,050
A saucer of milk or a can of
tuna would help find Naomi's cat

1393
01:13:24,138 --> 01:13:28,099
faster than her yelling
in the backyard.

1394
01:13:28,228 --> 01:13:29,579
One moment.

1395
01:13:32,538 --> 01:13:34,410
I think...

1396
01:13:35,759 --> 01:13:37,369
You got the can of tuna.

1397
01:13:46,943 --> 01:13:49,903
[birds chirping]

1398
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:53,341
Predators can't resist the bait.

1399
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:56,300
Same thing applies
to psychopaths.

1400
01:13:56,388 --> 01:13:58,999
Apparently, I'm
Billy's can of tuna.

1401
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:02,960
Yeah, he... he definitely
wants you, but...

1402
01:14:03,047 --> 01:14:05,179
He seems to go after
people around you.

1403
01:14:05,266 --> 01:14:07,181
I think we can use
that against him,

1404
01:14:07,268 --> 01:14:11,184
dangle the different
kind of bait.

1405
01:14:11,316 --> 01:14:14,232
- Yeah, me.
- No.

1406
01:14:14,318 --> 01:14:16,495
He does seem to go after
people that love you.

1407
01:14:16,626 --> 01:14:17,931
Love?

1408
01:14:18,018 --> 01:14:19,538
Okay, let's do
a full stop on that one.

1409
01:14:19,585 --> 01:14:22,327
We can come back to that
at a... at a later time.

1410
01:14:22,414 --> 01:14:25,764
But why don't you let me
help you try to find him?

1411
01:14:25,896 --> 01:14:28,028
He's coming either way.

1412
01:14:28,115 --> 01:14:30,553
I just want it to
be on my terms.

1413
01:14:30,683 --> 01:14:32,772
Now, we need something
to make him so angry

1414
01:14:32,903 --> 01:14:36,950
that he comes now, you know,
when I'm prepared for it,

1415
01:14:37,037 --> 01:14:40,171
like... forced
perspective in art.

1416
01:14:40,258 --> 01:14:42,913
We make him see what
we want him to see.

1417
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,480
We create an illusion for him

1418
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:48,222
that makes coming
after me irresistible.

1419
01:14:48,309 --> 01:14:50,616
What kind of illusion?

1420
01:14:50,702 --> 01:14:52,791
Control.

1421
01:14:52,879 --> 01:14:56,013
[sinister music]

1422
01:14:56,143 --> 01:14:57,928
Wow.

1423
01:14:58,014 --> 01:15:00,407
Yeah, the fire door
has saved all of this.

1424
01:15:00,539 --> 01:15:02,193
- Can you grab that box for me?
- Yeah.

1425
01:15:03,889 --> 01:15:07,023
I used to think he was spying
on me when he was at work.

1426
01:15:07,111 --> 01:15:08,871
Ripped all the cameras
out and put 'em in here.

1427
01:15:08,895 --> 01:15:10,723
But we could put 'em back up.

1428
01:15:10,809 --> 01:15:12,682
Sign me up.

1429
01:15:24,128 --> 01:15:27,000
Okay, he'll get an alert
once the app is live,

1430
01:15:27,087 --> 01:15:29,002
after we get done
setting them all up.

1431
01:15:29,133 --> 01:15:30,438
That'll get him watching.

1432
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:33,659
Great, one down, seven to go.

1433
01:15:33,746 --> 01:15:35,052
[Jules]: And I called the banks.

1434
01:15:35,139 --> 01:15:37,707
I changed the passwords
and I closed him out

1435
01:15:37,794 --> 01:15:40,231
on all of his accounts.
I mean, it was easy.

1436
01:15:40,318 --> 01:15:43,930
My name is on all of them.

1437
01:15:44,061 --> 01:15:46,106
What, I just thought we
needed some extra bait.

1438
01:15:46,237 --> 01:15:47,630
[Abby meowing]

1439
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,154
Who's that? Hm.

1440
01:15:50,284 --> 01:15:52,330
[Jules]: Well, now
it's time for our tuna.

1441
01:15:58,249 --> 01:16:01,165
Wow, you look beautiful.

1442
01:16:01,252 --> 01:16:03,254
Well, thank you.

1443
01:16:06,344 --> 01:16:08,172
Wanna play some music?

1444
01:16:08,259 --> 01:16:10,000
Whatever you like.

1445
01:16:10,087 --> 01:16:11,687
I couldn't have asked
for a better night,

1446
01:16:11,741 --> 01:16:14,918
so thank you, Paul.

1447
01:16:15,005 --> 01:16:17,094
You're welcome.

1448
01:16:19,096 --> 01:16:21,098
You continuously impress me.

1449
01:16:23,404 --> 01:16:27,234
Well, I hope the
night isn't over.

1450
01:16:27,321 --> 01:16:29,062
You sure?

1451
01:16:29,193 --> 01:16:31,761
I don't wanna rush you.

1452
01:16:31,848 --> 01:16:34,285
I'm sure.

1453
01:16:34,371 --> 01:16:37,027
Kiss me, Paul.

1454
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:46,776
[sinister music]

1455
01:16:47,951 --> 01:16:50,344
I need to lure him upstairs.

1456
01:16:50,475 --> 01:16:53,434
Okay, yeah, I could
hide behind the tarp.

1457
01:16:53,521 --> 01:16:55,480
And I'll be downstairs
in the living room.

1458
01:16:55,567 --> 01:16:57,612
And the first sign of him,
I'm up the stairs.

1459
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:59,780
No, no, I don't want you
risking your life like this.

1460
01:16:59,832 --> 01:17:02,182
We're both risking our lives.

1461
01:17:02,269 --> 01:17:04,750
You just need to call the
police as soon as he arrives.

1462
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,273
Then I run up the
stairs towards you.

1463
01:17:07,361 --> 01:17:08,710
And then?

1464
01:17:08,798 --> 01:17:10,407
And just like you taught me,

1465
01:17:10,538 --> 01:17:13,803
get free, run away, down the
back stairs and out the door.

1466
01:17:13,889 --> 01:17:15,369
Look, I just need
to prove he's alive.

1467
01:17:15,413 --> 01:17:18,590
I don't ever need to
see that face again.

1468
01:17:18,677 --> 01:17:19,939
Okay.

1469
01:17:23,421 --> 01:17:25,461
Jules, be careful, all right?
Once he comes inside...

1470
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:28,034
I know, get free and run away.

1471
01:17:28,165 --> 01:17:31,429
[suspenseful music]

1472
01:17:36,041 --> 01:17:38,654

01:17:59,065 --> 01:18:02,547
[music turns sinister]

1475
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:08,074
[suspenseful music]

1476
01:18:08,205 --> 01:18:09,641
There you are!

1477
01:18:09,728 --> 01:18:11,948
You bad girl!

1478
01:18:12,077 --> 01:18:15,212
Abby, sweetheart.

1479
01:18:15,299 --> 01:18:18,215
Oh my god.

1480
01:18:19,999 --> 01:18:21,871
You found her!

1481
01:18:22,001 --> 01:18:25,612
Naomi, what are you doing here?
You can't be here right now.

1482
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:28,660
I just... I wanted to thank
you for helping find Abby.

1483
01:18:30,487 --> 01:18:33,491
You really hate him, don't you?

1484
01:18:33,577 --> 01:18:35,754
- Billy?
- Yeah.

1485
01:18:35,885 --> 01:18:38,496
No, I don't hate him.
I hate what he did to me.

1486
01:18:38,583 --> 01:18:40,716
Oh, Jules, he...

1487
01:18:40,803 --> 01:18:42,805
He was always a good man.

1488
01:18:42,892 --> 01:18:44,850
Kind and compassionate and...

1489
01:18:44,937 --> 01:18:46,634
No, no, no, no, that was an act.

1490
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:48,985
Billy terrorized me.
He lied to me.

1491
01:18:49,072 --> 01:18:51,074
He made me feel diminished.

1492
01:18:51,161 --> 01:18:53,424
- No, he didn't.
- I don't care what you believe.

1493
01:18:53,511 --> 01:18:55,643
I'm telling you, Billy
is not a good man.

1494
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:57,080
Now, you have to go now!

1495
01:18:57,210 --> 01:19:00,431
No, I don't.

1496
01:19:00,518 --> 01:19:02,607
Excuse me?

1497
01:19:02,693 --> 01:19:07,916
[music turns sinister]

1498
01:19:12,486 --> 01:19:13,618
Surprise.

1499
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:24,977
You should thank Naomi,
she's been very helpful.

1500
01:19:25,108 --> 01:19:29,329
Driving you crazy has
been a bonding experience.

1501
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:34,900
Now, I need you to
unlock those accounts.

1502
01:19:34,987 --> 01:19:37,468
- No.
- Now!

1503
01:19:37,598 --> 01:19:40,036
- Maybe...
- Just give me a minute.

1504
01:19:40,123 --> 01:19:43,169
[grunts]

1505
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:45,128
Now, Naomi thinks
I came here to talk,

1506
01:19:45,215 --> 01:19:46,782
but we both know how this ends.

1507
01:19:46,869 --> 01:19:48,305
[gasps]

1508
01:19:48,392 --> 01:19:50,263
Bill, you said you'd be
done with this tonight.

1509
01:19:50,350 --> 01:19:53,963
- Baby, I love you...
- Plans change.

1510
01:19:54,093 --> 01:19:57,531
Billy, I just want her gone.

1511
01:19:57,662 --> 01:19:59,446
I sent the gas valve
to the police

1512
01:19:59,532 --> 01:20:00,772
'cause I knew that
they would suspect her.

1513
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,232
I just want this
to be over so that

1514
01:20:02,362 --> 01:20:04,123
you and I can finally be
together like we talked about!

1515
01:20:04,147 --> 01:20:06,452
[laughs]

1516
01:20:06,584 --> 01:20:07,824
You know I have the hammer with

1517
01:20:07,889 --> 01:20:10,501
your fingerprints
all over it, right?

1518
01:20:10,588 --> 01:20:12,087
Now, I don't wanna have
to do anything with it,

1519
01:20:12,111 --> 01:20:14,984
but I will if I have to.

1520
01:20:15,071 --> 01:20:18,814
This is not the way to start
a healthy relationship, Naomi.

1521
01:20:18,901 --> 01:20:21,425
I did all of this
for you, for... for us!

1522
01:20:21,512 --> 01:20:22,513
There is no us!

1523
01:20:22,643 --> 01:20:23,923
How could you possibly say that?

1524
01:20:23,949 --> 01:20:25,057
You know that we
had talked about...

1525
01:20:25,081 --> 01:20:26,952
[gunshot]

1526
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:29,480

Oh my god, what did you do!?

1527
01:20:32,305 --> 01:20:33,089

[Billy]: Here I come!

1532
01:20:41,487 --> 01:20:43,012
Let's fight!

1533
01:20:49,366 --> 01:20:53,849
People kill their next-door
neighbors every day!

1534
01:20:53,936 --> 01:20:56,547
Especially people
with mental problems

1535
01:20:56,677 --> 01:21:00,377
and dangerous hallucinations.

1536
01:21:00,507 --> 01:21:03,206
Now, this is full of your DNA.

1537
01:21:05,643 --> 01:21:08,646
[Female operator]: 911,
what is your emergency?

1538
01:21:08,733 --> 01:21:11,170
Jules!

1539
01:21:11,257 --> 01:21:13,781
[Operator]: Don't hang up,
we're tracking your location.

1540
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:16,784
If I can't have you,
no one else can!

1545
01:21:52,864 --> 01:21:54,450
[Jules]: We used to love
each other, remember?

1546
01:21:54,474 --> 01:21:56,041
[Billy]: Shut up!

1547
01:21:56,172 --> 01:21:58,391
You know this is not the
way you wanted it to end.

1548
01:21:58,522 --> 01:21:59,697
You just need help.

1549
01:21:59,784 --> 01:22:02,439
I don't need help!

1550
01:22:02,526 --> 01:22:06,398
I needed time.

1551
01:22:06,530 --> 01:22:09,750
And when I died, that stopped
your stupid divorce stuff.

1552
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:13,014
I started transferring money,
tried to build a life for us.

[pants]

1554
01:22:16,975 --> 01:22:18,169
But you thought
you could move on.

1555
01:22:18,193 --> 01:22:21,197
That cannot happen!

1556
01:22:21,327 --> 01:22:23,851
The insurance...

1557
01:22:23,982 --> 01:22:26,942
I really wanted
that to work for us.

1558
01:22:27,029 --> 01:22:32,469
Jules, I really, I really...

1559
01:22:32,599 --> 01:22:34,862
We would've been
fugitives and on the run,

1560
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,864
but we would have
been rich and in love,

1561
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:38,779
and that's all
I ever wanted from you!

1562

That's happening.

1565
01:22:47,397 --> 01:22:48,659
You first!

Yeah, I'm only
worried about you.

01:23:18,645 --> 01:23:21,257
Okay, sit up, sit up.

1574
01:23:21,387 --> 01:23:22,910

Jules! Ms. Baker!

1578

Yeah, we're up here!
We need help!

1579
01:23:41,712 --> 01:23:43,018
I got you.

1580
01:23:43,888 --> 01:23:45,541
We're up here.

[indistinct chatter]

1582
01:24:01,558 --> 01:24:04,822
So I... I added shading here
to give me more depth.

1583
01:24:04,952 --> 01:24:06,954
Jules suggested it, so...

1584
01:24:07,085 --> 01:24:08,434
I love it.

1585
01:24:08,565 --> 01:24:10,132
Oh, gosh.

1586
01:24:10,262 --> 01:24:12,568
All right, here you are.

1587
01:24:12,699 --> 01:24:17,052
Jules, you have
outdone yourself.

1588
01:24:17,182 --> 01:24:20,184
I can't believe that many
people came to see our artwork.

1589
01:24:20,272 --> 01:24:22,753

Courage and Strength?

Who doesn't wanna see that?

- You hear that, babe?
- Yes.

1592
01:24:26,148 --> 01:24:28,976
I got strength and courage
coming on all up in here.

1593
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:30,674
I'm so proud of you.

1599
01:24:41,032 --> 01:24:42,990
It's good to see you.

1600
01:24:43,121 --> 01:24:44,533
Didn't mean to
intrude on your event.

1601
01:24:44,557 --> 01:24:46,690
Oh no, it's not a problem.

1602
01:24:46,777 --> 01:24:49,103
I wanted you to know the body we
uncovered has been identified as

1603
01:24:49,127 --> 01:24:50,911
John Franklin.

1604
01:24:50,998 --> 01:24:53,653
Transient.

1605
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:56,352
Thank you, Detective,
for everything,

1606
01:24:56,482 --> 01:24:57,614
for believing me.

1607
01:24:57,701 --> 01:24:59,616
I didn't until it
was almost too late,

1608
01:24:59,702 --> 01:25:02,880
but that was just bad
detective work on my part.

1609
01:25:02,967 --> 01:25:04,447
Well, that's not how I see it.

1610
01:25:06,144 --> 01:25:08,364
One more thing.

1611
01:25:08,451 --> 01:25:13,847
The insurance payout for
your house is officially yours.

1612
01:25:13,934 --> 01:25:15,327
Case closed.

1613
01:25:15,414 --> 01:25:17,460
Thank you again.

1614
01:25:17,547 --> 01:25:19,723
Enjoy your party.

1615
01:25:19,809 --> 01:25:23,466
Ah, everything looks great!

1616
01:25:23,553 --> 01:25:25,424
- Cheers!
- [All]: Cheers!

1617
01:25:25,555 --> 01:25:28,210
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1618
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:32,562
So now that your
show is a success,

1619
01:25:32,692 --> 01:25:34,669
have you thought about what
your next art show should be?

1620
01:25:34,693 --> 01:25:37,915
Well, I was thinking
nude figure, but

1621
01:25:38,002 --> 01:25:39,656
I would need a model for that.

1622
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:43,355
Mm-hmm.

1623
01:25:43,442 --> 01:25:44,922
[Both]: [laughing]

1624
01:25:45,052 --> 01:25:46,489
But before all that, do...

1625
01:25:46,576 --> 01:25:48,230
Do you remember
what you said to me

1626
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:50,536
in the backyard?

1627
01:25:50,623 --> 01:25:53,713
Mm... it slipped my mind.

1628
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:56,368
Come on, stop playing.

1629
01:25:56,499 --> 01:25:58,588
Yeah.

1630
01:25:58,675 --> 01:26:00,633
I said that I love you.

1631
01:26:03,984 --> 01:26:05,986
- Guess what?
- Hm?

1632
01:26:06,073 --> 01:26:08,337
I love you too.
