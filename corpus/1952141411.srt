00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,801
 YOU WANT 1 OF THESE
 DEEP-DISH GREASY-ASS DONUTS ?

00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,234
I'M YOUR PARTNER

AND YOU FORGET
I'M A DIABETIC ?

7

 THAT'S RIGHT,
 YOU'RE MY PARTNER, MAN.

8
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:54,634
 WHAT EVER HAPPENED

10
00:02:55,868 --> 00:02:56,667
WHAT'S UP WITH HER ?

11
00:02:56,734 --> 00:02:58,000
SHE'S GOOD.

12
00:02:58,067 --> 00:03:00,000
I DON'T WANT HER LIFE STORY,
I JUST ASKED YOU A QUESTION.

13
00:03:00,067 --> 00:03:01,367
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

14
00:03:01,434 --> 00:03:02,334
 YOU'RE BULLSHITTING ME.

15
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,100
 NO.

16
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:04,234
YOU'RE BULLSHITTING ME !

17
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,634
NO, OVER THE WEEKEND,
I POPPED THE BIG Q.

18
00:03:05,701 --> 00:03:09,534
SHE CAME BACK WITH THE BIG A:

20
00:03:10,334 --> 00:03:11,033

25
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,767
YOU KNOW, I'M GETTING
TIRED OF THIS SHIT,

26
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:24,667
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

27
00:03:24,734 --> 00:03:28,200
I'M GONNA GET A REAL JOB,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

28
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:30,100
 WHAT ?

29
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:32,100
 I'LL MISS YOU, MAN.

 PFFFF !

31
00:03:33,534 --> 00:03:35,300
 I'M NOT GOING TO MISS YOU
 THAT DAMN MUCH, THOUGH.

32
00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:37,067
 YOU'RE THE ONE LEAVING
 THE BROTHER STILL IN THE 'HOOD.

33
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,367
HEY, ME AND HELEN,

00:03:47,334 --> 00:03:52,667
"BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT YOU,
I WANT TO BE WITH YOU."

40
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:53,534
 THAT'S IT ?

THAT'S ALL ?

43
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:58,434
WE WANTED A SHORT CEREMONY
SO WE COULD GET GOING.

44
00:03:58,501 --> 00:03:59,767

 ( EKG beeping )

119
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:07,200
 IT'S NOT FAIR, MAX.

120
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:12,667
( Max )
IT'S NEVER FAIR.

121
00:11:12,734 --> 00:11:15,334
I'M GONNA GET ON
HOME TO ANNA.

122
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,133

( Helen sobbing )

124
00:11:20,934 --> 00:11:25,634

126
00:11:51,434 --> 00:11:53,200
 IT'S, UM...

127
00:11:53,267 --> 00:11:55,501
IT'S JUST THAT HE'S CHANGED
SINCE WE GOT MARRIED.

128
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:56,968
 WELL, PEOPLE--

129
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:59,501
PEOPLE CHANGE, EVERYTHING
CHANGES, SEASONS CHANGE.

130
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:01,234
IN FACT, CHANGE IS THE ONLY
PERMANENT THING AROUND.

131
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,534
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, DOCTOR ?

132
00:12:02,601 --> 00:12:04,601
DIDN'T, DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT ?
IT'S IN ALL THE PAPERS.

133
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:05,901
 YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT ?

134
00:12:05,968 --> 00:12:07,801
HE'S ANGRY ALL
THE TIME, TOO.

135
00:12:07,868 --> 00:12:09,234
WHAT MAKES YOU
 ANGRY, MAX ?

136
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,300
WHAT MAKES MAX ANGRY ?

137
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,734
WELL, AH, BAD GUYS.

138
00:12:12,801 --> 00:12:15,000
THE "BAD GUYS" ? MAX,
WE'RE TRYING TO TALK HERE.

139
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,267
CAN'T YOU EVER STOP
ACTING LIKE A COP ?

140
00:12:17,334 --> 00:12:19,534
 THAT'S WHAT I DO, BABY.
I'M A COP, OKAY ?

141
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:21,367
I CAN'T JUST DROP
 MY LIFE OFF ON,

142
00:12:21,434 --> 00:12:23,200
 ON THE WAY HOME TO
 GET DRY-CLEANED.

143
00:12:23,267 --> 00:12:24,033
 YOU CAN GET
ANOTHER JOB.

144
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,968
 YEAH, LIKE WHAT ?

145
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:26,167
 I DON'T KNOW.
 SOMETHING.

146
00:12:26,234 --> 00:12:28,634
SOMETHING THAT I DON'T
ALWAYS HAVE TO LISTEN TO.

147
00:12:28,701 --> 00:12:29,767
 YOU DON'T WANT
 TO HEAR IT,

148
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:31,434
 NO ONE WANTS TO
HEAR IT. WHY AM I HERE ?

149
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,467
WHY AM I HERE ?

150
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:33,467
( Anna )
THERE'S A REASON
FOR THAT.

151
00:12:33,534 --> 00:12:35,701
 TRY US, MAX.

152
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:37,901
REASONS NOT
TO BE CHEERFUL, WELL...

153
00:12:37,968 --> 00:12:39,100
 AH...

154
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:41,901
 HOW ABOUT
FOR STARTERS MY...

155
00:12:41,968 --> 00:12:44,868
 MY FRIEND AND
PARTNER'S DYING.

156
00:12:44,934 --> 00:12:47,968
 AH, WOULD, UH, SOME OTHER
 EXAMPLES BE HELPFUL, DOCTOR ?

157
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,367
 WE ALL LOSE
PEOPLE, MAX.

158
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:53,667
YEAH, WELL,
I THINK COPS LOSE

159
00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:57,200
 JUST ABOUT
 EVERYBODY.

160
00:12:57,267 --> 00:12:59,667
I LOVE YOU,
MAX.

161
00:12:59,734 --> 00:13:04,000
BUT I DIDN'T SIGN
ON FOR WAR DUTY.

162
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:07,834
THIS IS ONLY OUR, OUR
THIRD YEAR TOGETHER.

163
00:13:07,901 --> 00:13:10,467
THINGS ARE GETTING
WORSE AND WORSE.

164
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,200
 I KNOW.

165
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:38,968
I GUESS THE THINGS I SEE
 IN THE STREET SOMETIME...

166
00:13:39,033 --> 00:13:41,601
 THEY KINDA MAKE...

167
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:47,601
DON'T MAKE
 ME FEEL LIKE...

168
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:52,367
 BABY, IT'S ME.

169
00:13:52,434 --> 00:13:57,434
NOT YOU.

170
00:13:57,501 --> 00:13:58,868
OH, HI, OFFICER.

171
00:14:13,567 --> 00:14:15,567
 ( EKG beeping )

172
00:14:37,734 --> 00:14:40,567
 ( accelerating EKG beeping )

173
00:14:54,167 --> 00:15:00,067
 HEY, MAXI-PAD !

 WHAT THE HELL ARE
 YOU DOING HERE ?

178
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:09,968
HEY, MODERN MEDICINE,
WHAT CAN I TELL YOU ?

179
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:17,501
AT LEAST I'M NOT PISSING
OUT OF MY ARMPITS, YOU KNOW ?

180
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:21,167
LOOK, I GOT HIT, I WOKE
UP IN THE HOSPITAL.

181
00:15:21,234 --> 00:15:22,834
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE FUCK THEY DID.

182
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:24,601
BUT WHATEVER THEY
DID, IT WORKED.

183
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:25,834
WHATEVER IT WAS,

184
00:15:25,901 --> 00:15:27,667
 IT WAS PRETTY FUCKING
WEIRD, MAN. LOOK AT YOU.

185
00:15:27,734 --> 00:15:29,100
ARE YOU SURE
 YOU'RE ALL RIGHT ?

186
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:30,667
I'VE STILL GOT A COUPLE
OF BANDAGES ON,

187
00:15:30,734 --> 00:15:33,067
BUT THEY'LL BE
OFF AFTER AWHILE.

188
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,434
HOW ABOUT YOU AND I GOING
OUT AND GETTING SOME BAD GUYS ?

189
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:43,467
WHAT DO YOU SAY ?

190
00:15:51,234 --> 00:15:53,834
 WHAT ?

191
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:55,834
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH
SUGAR IN THIS DONUT.

192
00:15:55,901 --> 00:15:57,868
 IT'S 1 OF OUR
 DIET DONUTS.

193
00:15:57,934 --> 00:15:59,667
DIET ? I ASKED FOR A
DONUT WITH SUGAR !

194
00:15:59,734 --> 00:16:01,501

 AHHH !

212
00:19:17,767 --> 00:19:18,934
 AHHH !

213
00:19:25,934 --> 00:19:27,767
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

214
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,934
IF YOU REVOKE THAT RIGHT,
ANYTHING YOU SAY...

215
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,567

 AND YOU
KICK IT, RIGHT ?

286
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,367
 NOW, HOW'S THAT ANY
 DIFFERENT FROM WHAT

00:25:50,934 --> 00:25:54,434
WELL, I'LL TELL
YOU WHAT.

293
00:25:54,501 --> 00:26:00,167
WHY DON'T YOU LET
ME THINK ABOUT IT ?

294
00:26:00,234 --> 00:26:01,701
 I'LL BE HERE.

295
00:26:24,267 --> 00:26:26,334
( rhythmic beeping )

296
00:26:36,334 --> 00:26:38,501
 SO THE FUCKING PERP
 SHAKES THE BANK,

297
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:40,567
STICKS THE MONEY
DOWN HIS PANTS AND RUNS.

298
00:26:40,634 --> 00:26:45,334
HE GETS MAYBE 50 FEET BEFORE
 THE DYE CARTRIDGE GOES, "POW !"

299
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,367
( Stratton )
WORST PAIR OF
 BLUE BALLS EVER.

300
00:26:47,434 --> 00:26:49,901
OH, MAN ! THAT SHIT'S
 GOT TO HURT, MAN.

301
00:26:49,968 --> 00:26:51,701
I HATE WHEN THAT HAPPENS.

302
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:53,367

GODDAMN HIP-HOP
WITH A LAUNCHER

305
00:26:56,534 --> 00:27:00,067
 IN HIS TRUNK.
THE KID IS 14.

306
00:27:00,133 --> 00:27:02,434
 WHEN I WAS 14 YEARS
 OLD, I WAS WATCHING

307
00:27:02,501 --> 00:27:05,667
 SOME  <i>HAPPY DAYS</i> ,
 FONZIE-TYPE SHIT.

308
00:27:05,734 --> 00:27:08,467
THAT SHOW'S A LITTLE TOO
COMPLICATED FOR STRATTON, HERE.

309
00:27:08,534 --> 00:27:11,234
 HEY, GO FUCK A CAT.

 MAN, HE WAS READY
 TO PACK IT IN,

313
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,334
GET MARRIED, EVERYTHING.

314
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,267
 GOES INTO THE HOSPITAL,
 COMES BACK OUT ACTING LIKE

00:27:23,334 --> 00:27:25,501
 DIRTY HARRY

00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:28,801
 IT HAPPENS, MAN.
 TOMBSTONE COURAGE.

317
00:27:28,868 --> 00:27:31,133
 NO, THIS IS WEIRD.
 IT'S LIKE HE'S BACK,

318
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,801
BUT HE'S BIGGER
THAN LIFE.

319
00:27:32,868 --> 00:27:34,901

PEREZ, HE'S A
HELL OF A COP, MAN.

323
00:27:38,634 --> 00:27:39,901
SAME THING HAPPENED--

324
00:27:39,968 --> 00:27:41,300
GOT GUNNED DOWN IN LINCOLN
HEIGHTS ABOUT A MONTH AGO.

325
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:43,634
 ( Max )
 NO, MAN, I HEARD IT
 WASN'T THAT BAD.

326
00:27:43,701 --> 00:27:47,367
IT WAS BAD. HE'S BACK
IN UNIFORM IN, LIKE, 4 DAYS.

327
00:27:47,434 --> 00:27:49,067
I MEAN, THAT
 CAN'T HAPPEN, MAN.

328
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:53,634

335
00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:08,267
 I WANTED TO THANK YOU
 FOR BEING A GOOD PARTNER.

336
00:28:08,334 --> 00:28:09,834

I KNOW JIM WOULD
WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.

351
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,868
 I...

352
00:29:22,934 --> 00:29:28,868
I HAVEN'T BEEN
IN HERE SINCE...

353
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,167
 ( Helen vomiting )

354
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,601
( doorbell ringing )

355
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:32,934
 MAX...

356
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,200
 GLAD YOU
 COULD MAKE IT.

357
00:30:38,267 --> 00:30:39,901
 HEY, MAN, THIS IS
 NOT A BAD PLACE

358
00:30:39,968 --> 00:30:43,200
ON A DETECTIVE'S SALARY.

359
00:30:43,267 --> 00:30:46,534
 A FEW INVESTMENTS,
 MONEY COMES IN.

360
00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:50,734
I'VE BEEN SAVING
FOR A WHILE.

361
00:30:50,801 --> 00:30:53,534
 I'M SORRY
 ABOUT JIM.

362
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,000
 YOU MAY NOT KNOW
EVERYONE HERE.

363
00:30:55,067 --> 00:30:57,501
 THEY'RE NOT ALL
 FROM YOUR DIVISION.

364
00:30:57,567 --> 00:31:00,767
 EVERYBODY,
MAX DIRE.

365
00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:05,667
 HI, MAX. WELCOME
TO THE CAUSE.

366
00:31:05,734 --> 00:31:07,567
 CASEY SPENCER.

367
00:31:07,634 --> 00:31:10,634
HEY, NO, NO. YOU, YOU I KNOW.
YOU'RE, AH, RAMON PEREZ.

368
00:31:10,701 --> 00:31:16,167
 HEY, MAXWELL HOUSE.
  <i>QUE PASA ? QUE BIEN.</i>

369
00:31:16,234 --> 00:31:18,567
 DOUG CRANE.
UH, NICE TO MEET YOU.

370
00:31:18,634 --> 00:31:20,901
THIS GUY CAN
 CHANGE YOUR LIFE.

371
00:31:20,968 --> 00:31:22,334
IT'S KILLER STUFF.

372
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,100
YOU ALL HAVE 1
THING IN COMMON.

373
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:36,667
EACH OF YOU HAS
AN OUTSTANDING RECORD.

374
00:31:36,734 --> 00:31:39,434
YOU'RE WARRIORS.

375
00:31:39,501 --> 00:31:43,267
THAT'S WHAT YOU ALL WANTED TO
BE WHEN YOU JOINED THE FORCE.

376
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:47,534
 BUT IT GOES DEEPER.

377
00:31:47,601 --> 00:31:51,634
YOU ALSO WANTED TO STRIKE BACK
AT THE EVIL DECAY OUT THERE.

378
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:55,701
 WE'VE ALL SUFFERED IN THE LINE
 OF DUTY, MAX. YOU AREN'T ALONE.

379
00:31:55,767 --> 00:31:59,467
MY SISTER,
 <i>MI HERMANITA</i> .

380
00:31:59,534 --> 00:32:02,300
WRONG PLACE,
 WRONG TIME.

381
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:04,734
 DRUG WAR CROSSFIRE.

382
00:32:04,801 --> 00:32:09,901
 AND I'VE BEEN SHOT. NO
FUCKING FUN, BOYS AND GIRLS.

383
00:32:09,968 --> 00:32:13,300
LOOK AT THIS SHIT.
BEAUTIFUL LA !

384
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:18,267
I TRIED TO STOP A PIMP FROM
WHIPPING UP ON HIS WHORE.

385
00:32:18,334 --> 00:32:21,701
THE BITCH STUCK A
BLADE IN MY BACK.

386
00:32:21,767 --> 00:32:24,801
I WAS A DESK JOCKEY
TILL I MET ADAM.

387
00:32:24,868 --> 00:32:27,801
NOW I HAVE MY
 LEGS BACK.

388
00:32:27,868 --> 00:32:30,501
 ( Garou )
 DOUG LOST
SOMETHING, TOO.

389
00:32:30,567 --> 00:32:33,667
 LET'S NOT GET INTO
 IT TONIGHT, OKAY ?

390
00:32:33,734 --> 00:32:35,868
 SAVINGS.

391
00:32:35,934 --> 00:32:38,767
 HOUSE.

392
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:39,801
GAMBLING.

393
00:32:47,567 --> 00:32:50,601
YEAH, WELL, MY PARTNER
 SHOT HIMSELF IN THE HEAD.

394
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:52,033
 IT'S BEEN A GOOD WEEK.

395
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,767
 YOUR WIFE
LEFT YOU ?

396
00:32:54,834 --> 00:32:57,133
YEAH, THAT TOO.

397
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,467
 SO WHAT, I GET IN
 THE CLUB NOW,

398
00:32:58,534 --> 00:33:00,968
 OR I GOT TO FUCK
 A CADAVER OR SOMETHING ?

399
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:02,501
 ( laughing )

400
00:33:02,567 --> 00:33:06,133
DEEP DOWN, ALL OF
YOU BLAME YOURSELVES.

401
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,234
 DON'T.

402
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:13,400
SOCIETY WANTS THE STREETS
CLEAN, QUIET NIGHTS...

403
00:33:13,467 --> 00:33:16,534
 BUT BY ITS RULES.

404
00:33:16,601 --> 00:33:20,801
ARE CRIMINALS
RESTRICTED ? FUCK NO.

405
00:33:20,868 --> 00:33:24,868
SO WHAT SHOULD WE DO ?
CIRCULATE A PETITION ?

406
00:33:24,934 --> 00:33:28,100
 THEY SAY WE'RE THE LAW.

407
00:33:28,167 --> 00:33:31,167
I SAY, IF WE'RE THE LAW,
 LET'S FUCKING BE THE LAW.

408
00:33:31,234 --> 00:33:32,734
WHOA, WHOA,
 WHOA, WHOA !

409
00:33:32,801 --> 00:33:34,868
 WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT ?

410
00:33:34,934 --> 00:33:37,667
 THEY MEAN MORAL
CRIME VS. TECHNICAL.

411
00:33:37,734 --> 00:33:43,067
 MAX, IS IT MORAL TO LET
 ANIMALS RULE THE STREETS ?

412
00:33:43,133 --> 00:33:45,267
 MORAL TO LET A
 KILLER WALK BECAUSE

413
00:33:45,334 --> 00:33:47,567
 YOU FORGOT TO
 READ HIM HIS RIGHTS ?

414
00:33:47,634 --> 00:33:50,334
NO FUCKING WAY, MAN,
HOSE IT OFF THE STREETS.

415
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,033
 CLEAN THE FUCKING
 <i>PENDEJO</i>  SCUM.

416
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,601
 UH, NOW, HOLD UP, ARE WE
 TALKING LIKE SOME SORT OF

417
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:58,601
PSEUDO-CHARLIE BRONSON
 VIGILANTE SHIT HERE ?

418
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:00,801
 WE CALL IT JUSTICE.

419
00:34:00,868 --> 00:34:03,000
 LAW AND ORDER.

420
00:34:03,067 --> 00:34:05,467
 ADAM, I GOT TO
TALK TO YOU.

421
00:34:05,534 --> 00:34:06,434
 LATER.

422
00:34:06,501 --> 00:34:11,834
 NOW.

423
00:34:11,901 --> 00:34:17,067
CASEY, TAKE GOOD
 CARE OF MAX.

424
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:19,901
 SURE.

425
00:34:19,968 --> 00:34:21,300
 SURE.

426
00:34:21,367 --> 00:34:22,334
MAX ?

427
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,167
 YOU DON'T WANT TO
 GO OUT TONIGHT.

428
00:34:39,234 --> 00:34:42,701
 WHY ?

429
00:34:42,767 --> 00:34:47,200
 'CAUSE, UM, MY MOTHER'S
SICK, UH, DOWN IN SAN DIEGO.

430
00:34:47,267 --> 00:34:49,801
 I GOT A-- I GOT A
 FLIGHT IN AN HOUR.

431
00:35:08,334 --> 00:35:10,968
 YOU'RE LYING.

432
00:35:11,033 --> 00:35:14,968
I DON'T LIKE THIS, ADAM.

433
00:35:15,033 --> 00:35:22,434
 I GET THE SHAKES,
 NIGHTMARES.

434
00:35:22,501 --> 00:35:24,300
I WANTED TO KNOW

435
00:35:24,367 --> 00:35:30,534
 WHAT IT'LL BE LIKE,
 YOU KNOW, IN 5 YEARS.

436
00:35:30,601 --> 00:35:35,934
 YOU KNOW THAT COP,
 MAX'S PARTNER ?

437
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,901
 I WENT TO THE
HOSPITAL.

438
00:35:40,968 --> 00:35:45,400
 HE'S GONNA DIE
 ANYWAY, RIGHT ?

439
00:35:45,467 --> 00:35:49,100
SO I DOSED HIM WITH IT.

440
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:54,267
JUST, JUST, JUST TO SEE
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.

441
00:35:54,334 --> 00:35:56,067
I DON'T WANT TO BURN
OUT LIKE THAT, MAN.

442
00:35:56,133 --> 00:35:58,400
 IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN.

443
00:35:58,467 --> 00:36:00,501
 HE WAS PUMPED
 FULL OF JUNK:

444
00:36:00,567 --> 00:36:03,267
 DEMEROL, MORPHINE,
 CODEINE.

445
00:36:03,334 --> 00:36:06,834
 DRUG INTERACTION,
 IT TIPPED HIM OVER.

446
00:36:06,901 --> 00:36:09,834
THIS OPERATION WILL
BE OVER IN A WEEK.

447
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:14,234
YOU'RE YOUNG,
 YOU CAN HANDLE IT.

448
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,934
 DON'T BACK OUT
 ON US NOW, DOUG.

449
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,400
WE NEED YOU.

450
00:36:23,634 --> 00:36:25,934
 HEY !

451
00:36:26,033 --> 00:36:28,701
 I CAN'T STAND
 BEING IGNORED.

452
00:36:28,767 --> 00:36:29,868
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
GONNA BE ABOUT

453
00:36:29,934 --> 00:36:31,901
A LOT OF COPS TALKING
ABOUT THEIR PROBLEMS,

454
00:36:31,968 --> 00:36:33,400
BUT OTHER THAN
THE ROMANTIC COUPLE

455
00:36:33,467 --> 00:36:35,467
 OUT THERE, NO
ONE'S TALKING.

456
00:36:35,534 --> 00:36:36,834
 YEAH, WELL...

457
00:36:36,901 --> 00:36:39,834
 WE TALK
 SOMETIMES.

458
00:36:39,901 --> 00:36:43,400
BUT... SOMETIMES WE
 DO MORE THAN TALK.

459
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:47,367
 LIKE WHAT ?

460
00:36:47,434 --> 00:36:49,434
 ( Perez )
ANOTHER ONE OF TEAGUE'S
 GUN-SELLING PARTIES.

461
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:51,634
 ( Liza )
 YEAH, BULLETS
 AND BUTTHEADS.

462
00:36:51,701 --> 00:36:54,000
 HEH-HEH, HEH-HEH.

463
00:36:54,067 --> 00:36:56,267
 RINGSIDE SEATS, MAN.

464
00:36:56,334 --> 00:36:58,000
 ODDS MAY BE A
 LITTLE 1-SIDED,

465
00:36:58,067 --> 00:37:00,300
 MAYBE WE SHOULD CUT
 HIM SOME SLACK, HUH ?

466
00:37:00,367 --> 00:37:02,200
CAN I ASK YOU
GUYS A QUESTION ?

467
00:37:02,267 --> 00:37:04,100
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU GUYS DOING ?

468
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:05,334
 ( Garou )
 PROTECT AND SERVE.

469
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,234
HEY, MAN, I'M GONNA PROTECT
MY ASS ON OUT OF HERE.

470
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,367
I DON'T NEED TO BE A PART
OF THIS HALLOWEEN SHIT.

471
00:37:10,434 --> 00:37:13,834
JUST WATCH...

472
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:16,467
 THEN DECIDE.

473
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,167
( Doug )
 YOU BETTER BE
 CAREFUL, PEREZ.

474
00:37:18,234 --> 00:37:19,400
 YOU'RE GETTING
 HITCHED TOMORROW.

475
00:37:19,467 --> 00:37:21,868
 YOU DON'T WANT TO
 GET YOUR DICK SHOT OFF.

476
00:37:38,601 --> 00:37:40,067
 HEY. HEY, HEY !

477
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:43,434
WHAT IS THAT SHIT ?

478
00:37:43,501 --> 00:37:45,334
VACCINATION.

479
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,801
 FLU SEASON.

480
00:37:46,868 --> 00:37:49,701
NO, IT'S NOT ILLEGAL
 RIGHT ?

481
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,234
 THAT SOME VITAMIN B12 ?
WHAT IS THAT SHIT, MAN ?

482
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,834
 NOT EVEN CLOSE.

483
00:37:59,367 --> 00:38:00,634
 SHALL WE ?

484
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:54,367
 ( grenade exploding )

485
00:38:54,434 --> 00:38:56,167
 ( machine guns firing )

486
00:39:09,367 --> 00:39:10,534
 RAMON.

487
00:39:48,968 --> 00:39:49,868
 THIS BETTER BE GOOD.

488
00:39:49,934 --> 00:39:50,868
 OH, IT'S GOOD.

489
00:39:50,934 --> 00:39:52,067
I HATE THE HEAT.

490
00:39:52,133 --> 00:39:53,868
WE GOT US A PROBLEM.

491
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:55,200
WHAT ?

492
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,767
 I SAW GAROU AND HIS
 LITTLE TEAM OF SUPER-COPS

493
00:39:57,834 --> 00:40:00,267
 TAKE OUT AT
LEAST 50 PEOPLE.

494
00:40:00,334 --> 00:40:01,601
 AND THIS IS GONNA
 SOUND CRAZY,

495
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:03,467
 BUT THEY WERE ON
SOME WILD DRUG.

496
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:04,767
 AND IT HAD THEM
 SO PUMPED UP,

497
00:40:04,834 --> 00:40:06,234
 THEY LOOKED
 LIKE MONSTERS.

498
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,000
REALLY ?

499
00:40:07,067 --> 00:40:08,367
 YEAH.

500
00:40:08,434 --> 00:40:09,968
WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD
PUT STAKES THROUGH

501
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:12,000
 THEIR HEARTS, OFFICER
DIRE, HOW ABOUT THAT ?

502
00:40:12,067 --> 00:40:14,601
 I'M SERIOUS, MAN,
 I SAW WHAT I SAW.

503
00:40:14,667 --> 00:40:17,534
 I THINK I SHOULD
 WRITE OUT A REPORT.

504
00:40:17,601 --> 00:40:19,300
 DETECTIVE GAROU
 HAS REQUESTED

505
00:40:19,367 --> 00:40:22,067
 YOU BE PUT ON
SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT.

506
00:40:22,133 --> 00:40:25,267
 UNDER HIM.
 IT'S QUITE AN HONOR.

507
00:40:25,334 --> 00:40:29,367
A CAREER MOVE.

508
00:40:29,434 --> 00:40:36,300
I'D THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT WHAT
I'D SAY OF HIM IF I WERE YOU.

509
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:37,567
AND, UH...

510
00:40:37,634 --> 00:40:41,501
I WOULDN'T BE WRITING UP
ANY REPORTS ABOUT MONSTERS.

511
00:40:51,434 --> 00:40:54,400
 ( speaking Spanish )

512
00:40:54,467 --> 00:40:57,100
 SINCE IT IS YOUR INTENTION
 TO ENTER INTO MARRIAGE...

513
00:40:57,167 --> 00:40:59,067
 ( speaking Spanish )

514
00:40:59,133 --> 00:41:01,467
 JOIN YOUR RIGHT HANDS

515
00:41:01,534 --> 00:41:04,801
AND DECLARE YOUR CONSENT
 BEFORE GOD AND HIS CHURCH.

516
00:41:04,868 --> 00:41:09,734
 ( speaking Spanish )

517
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,400
 DO YOU, RAMON PEREZ,
 TAKE FOR YOUR

518
00:41:12,467 --> 00:41:15,133
 LAWFUL WIFE ESTRELLA
 MALDONALDO,

519
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,767
 TO HAVE AND TO HOLD
 FROM THIS DAY FORWARD ?

520
00:41:17,834 --> 00:41:20,000
 ( speaking Spanish )

521
00:41:20,067 --> 00:41:22,133
FOR BETTER,
 FOR WORSE...

522
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,901
 ( speaking Spanish )

523
00:41:24,968 --> 00:41:28,133
 ( speaking Spanish )

524
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,167
 IN SICKNESS
AND IN HEALTH...

525
00:41:30,234 --> 00:41:34,467
 ( speaking Spanish )

526
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,501
 UNTIL DEATH
 DO YOU PART ?

527
00:41:45,434 --> 00:41:47,601
NO.

528
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:49,100
I CAN'T !

529
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:53,634
( speaking Spanish )

530
00:41:53,701 --> 00:41:56,701
 ( shouting in Spanish )

531
00:41:56,767 --> 00:42:00,868
 I DON'T WANT TO
 GET MARRIED, OKAY !

532
00:42:00,934 --> 00:42:02,467
YOU'RE JUST NOT
MY LIFE ANYMORE !

533
00:42:02,534 --> 00:42:04,300
MAX.

534
00:42:04,367 --> 00:42:07,000
 HE'S DONE THE
 RIGHT THING.

535
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:09,534
 REALLY.

536
00:42:09,601 --> 00:42:10,934
 DON'T WORRY.

537
00:42:32,601 --> 00:42:34,767
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL,
 AREN'T THEY ?

538
00:42:34,834 --> 00:42:36,367
 MM-HMM.

539
00:42:36,434 --> 00:42:40,701
 BEAUTIFUL ANIMALS
 LOCKED AWAY IN A CAGE.

540
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,334
YOU GONNA ANSWER
MY QUESTIONS ?

541
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,100
SEE, A WOMAN LIKE YOU
MAKES ME CURIOUS.

542
00:42:45,167 --> 00:42:46,801
MAX GETS CURIOUS,
HE DOES A LITTLE INVESTIGATING

543
00:42:46,868 --> 00:42:48,067
LOOKS INTO THE OLD FILES.

544
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:50,567
 AND GUESS WHAT I FIND ?
NOTHING IN THE COMPUTER.

545
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:54,267
NOTHING FROM THE TIME
WHEN YOU MET GAROU.

546
00:42:54,334 --> 00:42:57,267
YOU GONNA TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

547
00:42:57,334 --> 00:43:01,067
JUSTICE, REAL KIND.

548
00:43:01,133 --> 00:43:02,601
 JUSTICE.

549
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:06,534
I GOT A FEELING THERE'S A LOT
MORE THAN THAT GOING ON.

550
00:43:06,601 --> 00:43:10,567
 AND A LOT MORE
 THAN THAT WITH YOU.

551
00:43:10,634 --> 00:43:13,267
 I WAS LIVING OUT
IN CHATSWORTH,

552
00:43:13,334 --> 00:43:16,334
 IT WAS A HOME
 INVASION.

553
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:21,000
 THEY... KILLED MY
 HUSBAND, FRANK.

554
00:43:21,067 --> 00:43:24,934
 TOOK $200 AND
 SOME JEWELRY.

555
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,400
 SOME TRADE, HUH ?

556
00:43:27,467 --> 00:43:30,667
YOU KNOW, I HATED BEING
 A WOMAN THEN.

557
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:34,601
 SMALLER
 AND WEAKER.

558
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:40,367
 I WAS A COP, BUT I
 COULDN'T DO ANYTHING.

559
00:43:40,434 --> 00:43:44,567
 6 MONTHS AGO,
 I MET ADAM.

560
00:43:44,634 --> 00:43:48,133
 HE MADE ME PART
OF THE PACK.

561
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,901
 THE PACK ?

562
00:43:49,968 --> 00:43:52,067
 YEAH.

563
00:43:52,133 --> 00:43:54,367
 YOU CAN BE
 PART OF IT, TOO...

564
00:43:54,434 --> 00:43:57,167
IF YOU WANT.

565
00:43:57,234 --> 00:44:01,834
I LIKE YOU, MAX.

566
00:44:01,901 --> 00:44:03,634
JOIN US.

567
00:44:03,701 --> 00:44:06,534

568
00:44:06,601 --> 00:44:12,033
JOIN ME.

569
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,734
( snarling )

570
00:44:38,734 --> 00:44:40,167
 MAX !

571
00:44:40,234 --> 00:44:42,834
 YOU GOT A HALL PASS ?

572
00:44:42,901 --> 00:44:44,501
LISTEN, BOB-MEISTER...

573
00:44:44,567 --> 00:44:48,234
NOW, YOU KNOW THAT
WORKUP ON JIM, RIGHT ?

574
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,868
I'M GONNA NEED--
 I'M GONNA NEED TO SEE THAT.

575
00:44:50,934 --> 00:44:52,234
TAKE A NUMBER,
 DRAGNET.

576
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:56,067
 BOB-MEISTER, LISTEN TO ME,
NOW, I NEED TO SEE HIS BODY.

577
00:44:56,133 --> 00:44:59,000
JESUS, HAVEN'T YOU EVER
TRIED ANY HERB TEA, MAN ?

578
00:44:59,067 --> 00:45:02,701
 COME ON, SHOW
 ME THE BODY, MAN.

579
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:06,067
 COME ON.

580
00:45:06,133 --> 00:45:07,901
 SO MANY DEAD.

581
00:45:26,033 --> 00:45:28,400
 TAKE OUT THE SLUG.

582
00:45:28,467 --> 00:45:31,000
SCREW UP THE EVIDENCE CHAIN ?
YOU'LL GET ME A DETENTION.

583
00:45:31,067 --> 00:45:32,434
 IT'S A SUICIDE,
 EVERYBODY SAW IT,

584
00:45:32,501 --> 00:45:35,534
 HE SHOT HIMSELF
 IN THE HEAD.

585
00:45:35,601 --> 00:45:37,367
 TAKE THE SLUG OUT.

586
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,734
 OKAY.

587
00:45:39,801 --> 00:45:41,934
 BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO PULL HERE, MAN.

588
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,400
 GAROU TOLD ME
 NOT TO LET ANYONE

589
00:45:43,467 --> 00:45:44,901
DOWN HERE TO
 TOUCH THE BODY

590
00:45:44,968 --> 00:45:47,801
 UNTIL HE LOOKED
 AT IT HIMSELF, YOU KNOW ?

591
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:12,834
HIS SILVER DOLLAR.

592
00:46:12,901 --> 00:46:17,033
IT'S HIS GOOD LUCK PIECE.
SAVED HIS LIFE ONCE.

593
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,667
IT WASN'T IN HIS POCKET WHEN
HOMICIDE CHECKED THE BODY.

594
00:46:19,734 --> 00:46:23,334
 YOU LOST ME, MAN.

595
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,200
PUT HIM BACK.
QUICK.

596
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:43,801
 ( banging )

597
00:46:51,567 --> 00:46:52,734
 MAX !

598
00:46:52,801 --> 00:46:54,467
WHERE'S GAROU ?

599
00:46:54,534 --> 00:47:00,767
 HE'S NOT HERE.

600
00:47:00,834 --> 00:47:03,968
 WHAT DID GAROU
 DO TO JIM CASEY ?

601
00:47:04,033 --> 00:47:05,434
MAX, UM...

602
00:47:05,501 --> 00:47:08,367
ADAM WOULD HAVE TOLD
 YOU SOONER OR LATER, HE'S--

603
00:47:08,434 --> 00:47:10,667
TOLD ME WHAT
SOONER OR LATER ?

604
00:47:10,734 --> 00:47:12,400
 WELL...

605
00:47:12,467 --> 00:47:14,934
 ADAM ISN'T
 JUST A DETECTIVE.

606
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,567
 YOU KNOW, HE'S
 ALSO A SCIENTIST.

607
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:19,868
 A BIOCHEMIST.

608
00:47:19,934 --> 00:47:23,167
 AND THAT STUFF YOU
 SAW US TAKE, THAT SERUM.

609
00:47:23,234 --> 00:47:25,200
ADAM CREATED IT.

610
00:47:25,267 --> 00:47:28,801
WHEN WE TAKE IT, MAX, WE
CAN DO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING.

611
00:47:28,868 --> 00:47:34,000
YOU KNOW, WE'RE
FASTER, STRONGER...

612
00:47:34,067 --> 00:47:35,267
 BETTER.

613
00:47:35,334 --> 00:47:37,067
 WHAT THE FUCK
DOES THAT MEAN ?

614
00:47:37,133 --> 00:47:41,567
THOSE ASSHOLES ON THE STREET,
THEY'RE REVVED ALL THE TIME.

615
00:47:41,634 --> 00:47:43,567
WE CAN'T COMPETE
WITH THEM.

616
00:47:43,634 --> 00:47:45,501
 NOT WITHOUT
AN EDGE.

617
00:47:45,567 --> 00:47:49,067
YOU KNOW, YOU SAW RAMON
GET SHOT AND HE LIVED.

618
00:47:49,133 --> 00:47:50,868
WITH IT, WE HEAL
IMMEDIATELY.

619
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:53,167
NO, NO, YOU DON'T
 UNDERSTAND.

620
00:47:53,234 --> 00:47:55,033
THIS STUFF IS POTENT.

621
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:11,133
 FIRST ONE'S FREE.

622
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,067
 NO, I DON'T PUSH SHIT
 LIKE THAT IN MY BODY.

623
00:48:14,133 --> 00:48:17,667
 JESUS, MAX, WE'RE NOT
 TALKING COCAINE HERE.

624
00:48:17,734 --> 00:48:21,100
YOU TAKE FLU SHOTS ?
VITAMINS ?

625
00:48:21,167 --> 00:48:23,501
 THAT'S ALL THIS IS.

626
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,501
 A SUPER VACCINE.

627
00:48:26,567 --> 00:48:32,033
 LOOK.

628
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,567
 THE ANSWER IS "NO."

629
00:48:33,634 --> 00:48:35,734
YES.

630
00:48:35,801 --> 00:48:36,767
YOU HAVE TO.

631
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:37,968
 NO, I DON'T.

632
00:48:38,033 --> 00:48:41,067
ONLY 2 THINGS I HAVE
 TO DO: GET OLD AND DIE.

633
00:49:26,334 --> 00:49:27,667
 ( moaning )

634
00:49:44,367 --> 00:49:45,667
 ( snarling )

635
00:50:01,334 --> 00:50:03,067
 ( snarling )

636
00:50:13,467 --> 00:50:15,167
 MMM.

637
00:50:15,234 --> 00:50:18,033
MMMM. MAX.

638
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,067
 MAX.

639
00:50:20,133 --> 00:50:21,400
 WOULDN'T YOU
 LIKE TO TEAR INTO

640
00:50:21,467 --> 00:50:23,868
 EACH OTHER LIKE
 THAT EVERY NIGHT ?

641
00:50:23,934 --> 00:50:27,968
 YOU KNOW WE JUST BROKE
 ABOUT 30 PENAL CODES ?

642
00:50:28,033 --> 00:50:30,234
 I HAVE THIS ANIMAL
 MAGNETISM.

643
00:50:41,667 --> 00:50:44,667
 BE PART OF
 THE PACK, MAX.

644
00:50:44,734 --> 00:50:46,601
LOOK, IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
YOU'RE STRAIGHT

645
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:48,834
BACK ON REGULAR
ASSIGNMENT.

646
00:50:48,901 --> 00:50:52,067
BE A CHRISTIAN SCIENTIST
IF IT MAKES YOU HAPPY, BUT...

647
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:54,067
AT LEAST TRY IT.

648
00:50:54,133 --> 00:50:55,901
 YOU KNOW WHAT ?

649
00:50:55,968 --> 00:50:58,200
 I THINK I'M GONNA
 HAVE TO "JUST SAY NO."

650
00:50:58,267 --> 00:51:00,300
 PLEASE, MAX,
 JUST ONCE. PLEASE !

651
00:51:00,367 --> 00:51:06,701
 I DON'T MIND YOU ASKING,
BUT THE ANSWER IS "NO."

652
00:51:06,767 --> 00:51:08,300
 I GOTTA GO.

653
00:51:26,801 --> 00:51:30,133
 MAX ?

654
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:34,834
 I'M SORRY.

655
00:51:34,901 --> 00:51:35,901
( vase shattering )

656
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:36,968
 UNHH !

657
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:04,801
 AHHHH !

658
00:52:04,868 --> 00:52:07,601
IT'S DESTROYING WHAT
 IT DOESN'T NEED.

659
00:52:21,367 --> 00:52:24,467
 ( growling )

660
00:52:30,767 --> 00:52:32,167
NOW DO YOU
UNDERSTAND ?

661
00:52:38,234 --> 00:52:40,400
 SHIT !

662
00:52:40,467 --> 00:52:41,734
 LET'S GO FOR A RIDE.

663
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,667
 HERE'S HOW
 IT WORKS:

664
00:52:48,734 --> 00:52:51,634
 THE FIRST TIME YOU
TAKE IT, IT CHANGES YOU.

665
00:52:51,701 --> 00:52:57,767
NO SHIT.

666
00:52:57,834 --> 00:53:00,167
 YOU NEVER GO BACK
 TO HOW YOU WERE BEFORE.

667
00:53:00,234 --> 00:53:04,300
 IT REVS YOU UP.
IT'S A MIRACLE CURE.

668
00:53:04,367 --> 00:53:06,367
HEALS THE SICK.

669
00:53:06,434 --> 00:53:09,300
 YEAH, AND RAISES
 THE DEAD.

670
00:53:09,367 --> 00:53:11,400
TAKING MORE JUST
MAKES IT BETTER.

671
00:53:11,467 --> 00:53:14,067
 WE USUALLY DOSE UP
 JUST BEFORE WE GO OUT.

672
00:53:14,133 --> 00:53:17,300
 IT REALLY HELPS YOU WIN
 FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE.

673
00:53:17,367 --> 00:53:20,100
YEAH, ESPECIALLY
WHEN I.A. FINDS OUT, HUH ?

674
00:53:20,167 --> 00:53:22,067
 YOU WORRY TOO MUCH.

675
00:53:22,133 --> 00:53:25,000
 NOW REMEMBER, WHEN YOUR
 ADRENALIN RISES, YOU'LL CHANGE.

676
00:53:25,067 --> 00:53:27,901
 LOOK LIKE SOMETHING
OUT OF A THEME PARK.

677
00:53:27,968 --> 00:53:30,334
IT'S KIND OF
 COOL, ACTUALLY.

678
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,801
 IT SCARES THE SHIT
OUT OF THE BAD GUYS.

679
00:53:41,901 --> 00:53:44,601
ONE OF TEAGUE'S
ICEHOUSES, HUH ?

680
00:53:44,667 --> 00:53:46,067
LET'S DO IT.

681
00:54:00,601 --> 00:54:01,667
 HEY !

682
00:54:07,901 --> 00:54:10,634
YOU ARE GONNA
BUST THEM ?

683
00:54:10,701 --> 00:54:12,334
 THAT WAS HER IDEA.

684
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,300
HMMPH, YOU WANT TO
LEND ME YOUR KEYS ?

685
00:54:16,367 --> 00:54:19,100
 YOU NEED TO TAKE YOUR
 NARROW ASS ON HOME.

686
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,400
 WHAT THE HELL ARE
 WE GONNA DO NOW ?

687
00:54:35,467 --> 00:54:38,033
IT'S A GOOD THING WE TOOK
THAT DYNAMIC TENSION COURSE.

688
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:43,400
OH, YEAH.

689
00:54:43,467 --> 00:54:45,133
( wolf howling )

690
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,868
 FUN, HUH ?

691
00:54:59,934 --> 00:55:02,067
( Casey grunting )

692
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:20,400
 ( growling )

693
00:55:20,467 --> 00:55:21,467
 FUCK !

694
00:56:09,234 --> 00:56:12,467
 OKAY, STRIKE 3.

695
00:56:12,534 --> 00:56:16,834
 THAT ASSHOLE'S FUCKED WITH
 MY DEALS FOR THE LAST TIME.

696
00:56:16,901 --> 00:56:18,801
 MY PEOPLE INSIDE TELL
 ME HIS NAME'S GAROU.

697
00:56:18,868 --> 00:56:21,133
 HE'S HEAD OF SOME
SPECIAL TEAM.

698
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:25,400
 SPECIAL TEAM ? THEY
 WERE FUCKING ANIMALS.

699
00:56:25,467 --> 00:56:27,234
 YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
 IF I LEFT HIM ALONE,

700
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,267
 MAYBE HE'D
 JUST GO AWAY.

701
00:56:29,334 --> 00:56:30,567
 LIKE THE FLU.

702
00:56:30,634 --> 00:56:31,767
 YEAH, MR. TEAGUE,

703
00:56:31,834 --> 00:56:32,868
 BUT WHAT IF THESE GUYS
 DECIDE TO SCREW UP

704
00:56:32,934 --> 00:56:34,734
 THE CONVENTION AT
THE DOCK NEXT WEEK ?

705
00:56:34,801 --> 00:56:37,234
 EXCUSE ME ?
I DIDN'T GET IT.

706
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,467
 HANDLE IT.

707
00:56:38,534 --> 00:56:39,701
HANDLE IT ?
 HANDLE IT.

708
00:56:39,767 --> 00:56:42,067
 YOU MEAN LIKE I CAN
PLAN IT, HANDLE IT ?

709
00:56:42,133 --> 00:56:45,400
THINK SNEAKERS:
"JUST FUCKING DO IT."

710
00:56:45,467 --> 00:56:46,434
 OH !

711
00:56:46,501 --> 00:56:50,300
 BEAUTIFUL.
 NO PROBLEM.

712
00:56:50,367 --> 00:56:51,968
 HEY, DON'T WORRY,
 MR. TEAGUE.

713
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:53,634
 STEPHAN'LL TAKE
 CARE OF EVERYTHING.

714
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:55,434
 IT'S UNDER CONTROL.

715
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:16,100
I'VE BEEN HEARING LOTS OF TALK
 ABOUT SAFE STREETS, GAROU.

716
00:57:16,167 --> 00:57:18,234
 BUT I HAVEN'T
 SEEN RESULTS.

717
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:19,801
 APART FROM
THAT TAKEDOWN

718
00:57:19,868 --> 00:57:22,100
 AT THE BEACH PARTY
THE OTHER NIGHT.

719
00:57:22,167 --> 00:57:26,767
 CHANGE TAKES TIME.

720
00:57:26,834 --> 00:57:28,801
I'VE GOT NERVOUS
PEOPLE IN CITY HALL.

721
00:57:28,868 --> 00:57:30,901
 WITH ANOTHER ONE OF
 TEAGUE'S ARMS DEALS

722
00:57:30,968 --> 00:57:33,767
GOING DOWN IN A FEW DAYS,
 THEY WANT RESULTS.

723
00:57:33,834 --> 00:57:37,567
I GET RESULTS... MY WAY.

724
00:57:37,634 --> 00:57:40,334
 YOU KNEW THAT GOING IN.

725
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,868
TALK TO P.D. IN DALLAS,
 MIAMI, DETROIT.

726
00:57:43,934 --> 00:57:48,200
ASK THEM IF THEIR CITIES
WEREN'T SAFER WHEN I WAS DONE.

727
00:57:48,267 --> 00:57:51,968
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM,
 I CARE ABOUT LA.

728
00:57:52,033 --> 00:57:56,767
 IT'S NICE TO SEE
 YOU CARING, CHIEF.

729
00:57:56,834 --> 00:57:59,367
 YOU'RE A REAL PRICK,
AREN'T YOU, DETECTIVE ?

730
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,834
IS THAT A DESPERATE
 CRY FOR LOVE ?

731
00:58:32,334 --> 00:58:33,534
 ( growling )

732
00:58:41,667 --> 00:58:42,901
( door opening )

733
00:58:57,634 --> 00:59:00,467
 SOMEONE'S BEEN BAD.

734
00:59:16,601 --> 00:59:21,133
YOU TOLD ME TO DO
 WHAT I HAD TO.

735
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,667
 I'M SORRY
 I SHOT HIM.

736
00:59:23,734 --> 00:59:25,567
 I DIDN'T KNOW HOW
 ELSE TO GET HIM ON IT.

737
00:59:25,634 --> 00:59:29,167
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT
THAT YOU SHOT HIM.

738
00:59:29,234 --> 00:59:33,868
 I DIDN'T TELL YOU
 TO FUCK HIM.

739
00:59:33,934 --> 00:59:37,567
 DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME ?

740
00:59:37,634 --> 00:59:38,667
 YEAH.

741
00:59:38,734 --> 00:59:41,167
THEN YOU MUST
HAVE FORGOT.

742
00:59:41,234 --> 00:59:45,567
'CAUSE YOU'RE ONLY
SUPPOSED TO FUCK ME.

743
00:59:45,634 --> 00:59:52,834
 I'M TOP DOG.
 REMEMBER ?

744
00:59:52,901 --> 00:59:54,234
DO YOU LIKE HIM ?

745
00:59:59,968 --> 01:00:01,033
 YES.

746
01:00:09,634 --> 01:00:13,734
 ( snarling )

747
01:00:13,801 --> 01:00:15,701
 ( growling )

748
01:00:24,467 --> 01:00:29,267
DO YOU LIKE HIM ?

749
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:32,534
 NO.

750
01:00:32,601 --> 01:00:34,334
 NO, I...

751
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,734
 I DON'T LIKE HIM.

752
01:00:59,534 --> 01:01:01,167
 ( snarling )

753
01:01:31,701 --> 01:01:34,300
 ( growling )

754
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,601
 ( all )
 SURPRISE !

755
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:32,434
 ( applauding and chattering )

756
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,067
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

757
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,200
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MAX !
 THE BIG 3-0.

758
01:02:49,267 --> 01:02:51,634
 ( applauding and cheering )

759
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:53,834
 NOW LISTEN,
 I HEAR YOU GUYS

760
01:02:53,901 --> 01:02:56,100

 GREAT STUFF DOWN THERE.

761
01:02:56,167 --> 01:02:57,734
 SO...

762
01:02:57,801 --> 01:03:01,100
 I THINK IT'S TIME YOU TAKE
 YOUR SILVER MEDAL BACK.

763
01:03:01,167 --> 01:03:02,634
 ( applauding )

764
01:03:02,701 --> 01:03:03,834
 AH !

765
01:03:20,734 --> 01:03:22,300
 ( rapid heart beating )

766
01:03:38,734 --> 01:03:40,567
HOW WAS HOUSTON ?

767
01:03:40,634 --> 01:03:44,334
UM, A LOT OF GUYS
IN BIG HATS.

768
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,167
FLEMING CALLED AND THOUGHT
THAT I SHOULD BE HERE.

769
01:03:48,234 --> 01:03:53,000
I MISSED YOU.

770
01:03:53,067 --> 01:03:55,234
 BABE, YOU LOOK
 TERRIBLE.

771
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:58,367
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU ?
LOOK AT YOUR FACE.

772
01:03:58,434 --> 01:03:59,200
I'M OKAY.

773
01:03:59,267 --> 01:04:00,067
NO, YOU'RE NOT OKAY.

774
01:04:00,133 --> 01:04:00,901
COME ON, TELL ME
WHAT'S...

775
01:04:00,968 --> 01:04:01,634
 I'M COOL.

776
01:04:01,701 --> 01:04:04,133
 IT'S ME !

777
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,334
 MAX, TELL ME.

778
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,267
 BABY,
 I LOVE YOU.

779

WHATEVER IT IS, WE'LL
GET THROUGH IT TOGETHER.

780
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,367
DON'T,
IT HURTS !

781
01:04:29,467 --> 01:04:30,667
 DAMMIT !

782
01:04:42,701 --> 01:04:44,834
 ( rock music playing )

783
01:04:44,901 --> 01:04:46,267
MAX, YOU KNOW
 THAT THING

784
01:04:46,334 --> 01:04:48,334
 I DIDN'T DO TO
 YOUR DEAD PARTNER ?

785
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:52,000
WELL, I RAN A CBC ON HIS BLOOD,
 MAN. HIS CRIT WAS HIGH.

786
01:04:52,067 --> 01:04:57,033
 THE EOSINOPHIL COUNT
WAS WAY UP THERE.

787
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:59,367
 WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS,
 THERE'S SOMETHING IN HIS BLOOD.

788
01:04:59,434 --> 01:05:01,167
WHAT'S UP, MAN ?
HOW YOU DOING ?

789
01:05:01,234 --> 01:05:02,567
HAVE A BEER, MAN !
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM ?

790
01:05:02,634 --> 01:05:05,534
IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY,
LET'S GO ! LET'S GO ! HEY !

791
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:07,567
 WHAT ?

792
01:05:07,634 --> 01:05:13,601
 HEY, LOOK, MAN. HERE COMES
 YOUR NEW BUSINESS PARTNER.

793
01:05:13,667 --> 01:05:15,767
 ( eerie music playing )

794
01:05:26,868 --> 01:05:29,200
 HEY, IT'S
 PRESENT TIME, MAX.

01:05:44,501 --> 01:05:46,067
HEY, HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
MAXIE !

796
01:05:46,133 --> 01:05:48,434
JUST WHAT YOU ALWAYS
NEEDED THERE, BUDDY.

797
01:05:48,501 --> 01:05:51,968
 COME ON, OPEN IT UP.
HEY, DON'T BE SHY.

798
01:05:52,033 --> 01:05:55,534
CAREFUL, YOU'RE GONNA BUST IT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

799
01:06:02,133 --> 01:06:04,167
HA-HA-HA !

800
01:06:17,601 --> 01:06:20,334
 WE HAVE TO GO, MAX.

801
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,167
I HAVE A VERY SPECIAL
PRESENT FOR YOU.

802
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,100
 NICE PARTY, POOPER.

803
01:06:34,167 --> 01:06:36,033
I NEVER SHOULD'VE
COME BACK.

804
01:06:46,868 --> 01:06:49,634
 ANYTHING THAT FEELS
 THIS GOOD, MAN,

805
01:06:49,701 --> 01:06:51,167
 CAN'T BE GOOD FOR YOU.

806
01:06:51,234 --> 01:06:52,667
IT HASN'T HURT ME

807
01:06:52,734 --> 01:06:54,367
AND I'VE BEEN
TAKING IT A LONG TIME.

808
01:06:54,434 --> 01:06:55,767
YEAH, HOW LONG ?

809
01:06:55,834 --> 01:06:57,601
 LONG ENOUGH.

810
01:06:57,667 --> 01:06:59,534
 SINCE FRANCE.

811
01:06:59,601 --> 01:07:00,968
 FRANCE ?

812
01:07:01,067 --> 01:07:03,968
 I GREW UP THERE.

813
01:07:04,033 --> 01:07:07,067
WHEN I WAS A KID, MAX, IT WAS
 SAFE TO WALK THE STREETS.

814
01:07:07,133 --> 01:07:10,334
 YOU COULD LEAVE YOUR HOME
 AND NOT FEEL LIKE PREY.

815
01:07:34,267 --> 01:07:39,567
 YEAH.

816
01:07:39,634 --> 01:07:42,300
LOOKS GOOD.

817
01:07:42,367 --> 01:07:44,100
IT'S GOING TO BE
A CLOSED CASKET.

818
01:08:00,567 --> 01:08:02,234
 ( snarling )

819
01:08:07,968 --> 01:08:13,734
 WE NEED GUNS.

820
01:08:13,801 --> 01:08:18,267
 TOUGH GUYS, HUH ?

821
01:08:18,334 --> 01:08:20,834
 FUCK.
 WE NEED GUNS.

822
01:08:45,901 --> 01:08:47,567
 ( helicopter hovering )

823
01:08:57,801 --> 01:08:58,968
 ( glass shattering )

824
01:10:27,434 --> 01:10:29,200
 WE NEED A
NEW VEHICLE.

825
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:31,067
 CHIEF WANTS TO
 SEE YOU. NOW.

826
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:39,834
 OH, YEAH, MAX,

827
01:10:39,901 --> 01:10:41,667
THERE'S SOME PIECE OF SHIT
DOWN IN HOLDING.

828
01:10:41,734 --> 01:10:43,133
HE'S RANTING
ABOUT GAROU.

829
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:48,968
 YOU MIGHT WANT
 TO CHECK IT OUT.

830
01:10:49,033 --> 01:10:50,133
( door slamming )

831
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:57,501
I HOPE TO HELL YOU KNOW
 WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

832
01:10:57,567 --> 01:10:59,067
 SOMETHING WEIRD
 ABOUT HIM, MAX.

833
01:10:59,133 --> 01:11:00,968
 YOU WANT ME
 TO STAY ?

834
01:11:01,033 --> 01:11:02,300
 I GOT IT.

835
01:11:10,067 --> 01:11:16,167
 I'M FROM GAROU.

836
01:11:16,234 --> 01:11:18,801
WHO ARE YOU ?

837
01:11:18,868 --> 01:11:20,300
 PART OF HIS TEAM.

838
01:11:20,367 --> 01:11:23,200
( laughing )

839
01:11:23,267 --> 01:11:29,200
I DON'T WANT UNDERLINGS.
I WANT HIM.

840
01:11:29,267 --> 01:11:35,167
 ( growling )

841
01:11:35,234 --> 01:11:39,801
 ( sniffing )

842
01:11:39,868 --> 01:11:43,100
 YOU'RE ON IT.

843
01:11:43,167 --> 01:11:46,367
 GET OUT WHILE
 YOU CAN, BRO.

844
01:11:46,434 --> 01:11:49,701
 WHO THE FUCK
ARE YOU, MAN ?

845
01:11:49,767 --> 01:11:54,400
DETECTIVE TOM DAVIES.

846
01:11:54,467 --> 01:12:00,200
 MIAMI P.D.

847
01:12:00,267 --> 01:12:05,801
WHO DID THIS
 TO YOU, MAN ?

848
01:12:05,868 --> 01:12:09,901
IT'S YOUR BOSS.

849
01:12:09,968 --> 01:12:12,000
 HE'S A FUCKING
 MONSTER.

850
01:12:12,067 --> 01:12:13,634
WHEN ?

851
01:12:13,701 --> 01:12:18,200
 2 YEARS AGO.

852
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:21,133
 ( sniffing )

853
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:24,133
 YOU'RE HOLDING. GIVE ME !
HEY !

854
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,701
 WHAT DID HE
 DO TO YOU ?

855
01:12:25,767 --> 01:12:29,267
 WHAT DID HE
 DO TO YOU !?!

856
01:12:29,334 --> 01:12:32,934
I DID THE JOB FOR HIM,
CLEANED UP CITY.

857
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,267
 AND THE REST OF
 YOUR PACK ?

858
01:12:34,334 --> 01:12:35,734
DEAD.

859
01:12:35,801 --> 01:12:39,968
I'M THE ONLY ONE LEFT.
HE KILLED THEM. I GOT AWAY.

860
01:12:40,033 --> 01:12:41,400
HEH-HEH.

861
01:12:41,467 --> 01:12:43,133
 YOU FOLLOWED HIM HERE
 TO GET SOME MORE OF THAT STUFF.

862
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:47,467
FUCK NO!
I CAME TO KILL HIM !

863
01:12:47,534 --> 01:12:51,534
IT'S A GODDAMN CAVE !!!

864
01:12:51,601 --> 01:12:55,434
 ( snarling )

865
01:12:55,501 --> 01:12:59,934
 RELAX !

866
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,300
 I TOOK IT
 TOO MANY TIMES.

867
01:13:04,367 --> 01:13:08,434
 I CAN'T GO BACK.

868
01:13:08,501 --> 01:13:12,534
IT STRIPS YOUR GLANDS.

869
01:13:12,601 --> 01:13:18,701
 IT LEAVES YOU
 UNEMPLOYABLE.

870
01:13:18,767 --> 01:13:20,567
( snarling )

871
01:13:20,634 --> 01:13:22,367
MOTHERFUCKER !!

872
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,667
 WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO.

873
01:13:40,667 --> 01:13:48,200
I'M TIRED, MAN. I'M GONNA
TAKE A LITTLE BREAK.

874
01:13:48,267 --> 01:13:50,000
 JESUS, WHAT
 THE FUCK HAPPENED ?

875
01:13:50,067 --> 01:13:53,133
 NOBODY'S ALLOWED
A GUN IN HERE.

876
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:57,300
HE ATTACKED OFFICER DIRE.
 I HAD TO SHOOT.

877
01:14:04,534 --> 01:14:06,501
 YEAH, LIKE
 THE MAN SAID.

878
01:14:19,567 --> 01:14:21,067
 MAX !

879
01:14:21,133 --> 01:14:23,434
 MAXIE !

880
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:25,634
 WHAT THE HELL
 HAPPENED, MAN ?

881
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,033
 THIS IS MY BRAIN.

882
01:18:07,834 --> 01:18:10,200
 THIS IS YOU
ON MY BRAIN.

883
01:18:10,267 --> 01:18:11,767
 ANY QUESTIONS ?

884
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,901
YOU GOT US ALL HOOKED
ON YOUR OWN BODY, MAN.

885
01:18:28,968 --> 01:18:33,400
 LOW OVERHEAD.

886
01:18:33,467 --> 01:18:35,067
YOU'RE A MOTHERFUCKING
WEREWOLF.

887
01:18:35,133 --> 01:18:40,334
 WAS. THERE'S NO WORD
FOR WHAT I AM NOW.

888
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:43,901
 MY FAMILY WAS
 HUNTED DOWN LIKE ANIMALS.

889
01:18:43,968 --> 01:18:45,868
 PREYED ON.

890
01:18:45,934 --> 01:18:49,734
I HATED BEING AT THE MERCY
 OF THE LUNAR CYCLE.

891
01:18:49,801 --> 01:18:53,901
 IT'S SO PRIMITIVE.
IT'S PATHETIC.

892
01:18:53,968 --> 01:18:57,400
 I LEARNED TO
DIRECT IT.

893
01:18:57,467 --> 01:19:01,234
 BIOFEEDBACK.
DRUGS.

894
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:03,367
 I REFINED IT.

895
01:19:03,434 --> 01:19:08,801
MADE IT MINE
 TO CONTROL AND TO GIVE.

896
01:19:08,868 --> 01:19:11,133
 NO, NO. UH-UH.

897
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,634
HE'S ONLY SUPPOSED TO
CHANGE ON THE FULL MOON.

898
01:19:13,701 --> 01:19:15,367
 FULL MOON ?

899
01:19:15,434 --> 01:19:17,567
 YOU'RE A ROMANTIC, MAX.

900
01:19:17,634 --> 01:19:21,400
 SO WAS I IN THE BEGINNING.

901
01:19:21,467 --> 01:19:23,133
 WHEN I CAME TO AMERICA,

902
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:25,501
 THIS WAS THE GREATEST
 COUNTRY ON EARTH.

903
01:19:25,567 --> 01:19:33,067
I WANTED TO GIVE SOMETHING
 BACK, SO I BECAME A COP.

904
01:19:33,133 --> 01:19:37,667
 PUT TOGETHER SPECIAL TEAMS
 TO START CLEANING THE CITIES.

905
01:19:37,734 --> 01:19:40,400
AND IT WORKS.

906
01:19:40,467 --> 01:19:42,267
HE'S INFECTING
 ALL OF YOU, HUH ?

907
01:19:42,334 --> 01:19:44,834
THIS NEO-NAZI,
SUPER-COP BULLSHIT ?

908
01:19:44,901 --> 01:19:46,734
 LOOK, YOU'RE SWALLOWING
 HIS INSANITY RIGHT NOW.

909
01:19:46,801 --> 01:19:47,734
GO AHEAD,
 SHOOT UP, MAN.

910
01:19:47,801 --> 01:19:51,300
GO AHEAD,
 SHOOT UP !

911
01:19:51,367 --> 01:19:53,701
 WAIT.

912
01:19:53,767 --> 01:19:55,267
 TAKE IT.

913
01:19:55,334 --> 01:19:57,634
 WAIT.

914
01:19:57,701 --> 01:19:58,801
 ( snarling )

915
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:07,567
 MAX, NO !

916
01:20:07,634 --> 01:20:08,868
 YOU SICK MOTHERFUCKER.

917
01:20:08,934 --> 01:20:12,167
 TONIGHT, WE TAKE BACK
 THE STREETS.

918
01:20:12,234 --> 01:20:14,734
 YEAH, YEAH. TAKE BACK
 THE STREETS, HUH ?

919
01:20:14,801 --> 01:20:16,934
I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH
 ON YOU, GAROU.

920
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,501
FULL ECLIPSE
EACH TIME, HUH ?

921
01:20:18,567 --> 01:20:21,400
 EVERY CITY YOU WENT TO:
 DETROIT, DALLAS, MIAMI.

922
01:20:21,467 --> 01:20:22,801
 EXCEPT FOR
ONE LITTLE THING

923
01:20:22,868 --> 01:20:24,133
 I BET YOU DIDN'T TELL
 THE REST OF THE TEAM, HUH ?

924
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:27,801
 EACH TIME, YOU'RE
 THE ONLY ONE LEFT ALIVE, MAN.

925
01:20:27,868 --> 01:20:31,067
 EVERYBODY ELSE IS DEAD...

926
01:20:31,133 --> 01:20:34,767
EXCEPT FOR YOU.

927
01:20:34,834 --> 01:20:38,567
 YOU'RE SMART, MAX.

928
01:20:38,634 --> 01:20:41,400
WHY DO YOU THINK
I CHOSE YOU ?

929
01:20:41,467 --> 01:20:45,267
THE PROCESS DOESN'T
END WITH ME.

930
01:20:45,334 --> 01:20:49,734
I NEED SOMEONE TO CARRY ON
AFTER I'M GONE.

931
01:20:49,801 --> 01:20:53,100
IT'S A HELL OF A GIG.

932
01:20:53,167 --> 01:20:55,634
YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT SOME ?

933
01:20:55,701 --> 01:20:58,934
OR DO I EXECUTE
ANOTHER TRACHEOTOMY ?

934
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,868
 NOT TODAY,
MOTHERFUCKER.

935
01:21:00,934 --> 01:21:01,934
 CASEY !

936
01:21:20,133 --> 01:21:23,167
 OHHHH !

937
01:21:23,234 --> 01:21:25,934
 COME ON. WE GOT TO
 GET SOMEWHERE SAFE.

938
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,334
 TO THE BEACH.
 HE CAN'T PICK UP OUR SCENT.

939
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:45,200
IT HASN'T BEEN THAT LONG
SINCE WE SHOT UP.

940
01:21:45,267 --> 01:21:47,334
WE'RE GONNA HEAL.

941
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:51,334
 ( coughing )

942
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:52,868
WHAT'S WRONG ?

943
01:22:00,534 --> 01:22:04,534
I HAVEN'T BEEN TAKING IT.
 I TRIED TO DRY OUT.

944
01:22:04,601 --> 01:22:06,767
 THAT FALL HURT ME BAD.

945
01:22:06,834 --> 01:22:10,133
YOU GOT SOME. GO AHEAD,
DOSE UP OR YOU'RE GONNA DIE.

946
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:14,701
YOU TAKE IT. HEAL YOURSELF.
 DESTROY GAROU.

947
01:22:36,634 --> 01:22:41,334
 AHHHH !

948
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:43,367
 ( growling )

949
01:22:58,234 --> 01:22:59,267
( Perez )
WHERE WE GOING ?

950
01:22:59,334 --> 01:23:00,501
SAN PEDRO.

951
01:23:00,567 --> 01:23:02,000
THE CONSORTIUM'S MEETING.

952
01:23:02,067 --> 01:23:03,801
I THOUGHT WE WERE
JUST TAKING OUT TEAGUE.

953
01:23:03,868 --> 01:23:05,133
WE ARE.

954
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:06,934
HE'S JUST
 THE SYMPTOM.

955
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,234
 TONIGHT WE BEGIN TO
 PURGE THE DISEASE.

956
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:11,834
IT'S OVER, GAROU.

957
01:23:11,901 --> 01:23:15,033
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU
 AND YOUR COMMANDO TACTICS.

958
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:18,000
 YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE
 ARE OFF ASSIGNMENT.

959
01:23:18,067 --> 01:23:24,601
WHAT THE HELL'S
 HAPPENED ?

960
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:26,300
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU
 ON THAT.

961
01:23:34,367 --> 01:23:36,267
HEY, LISTEN, WHERE'S
 GAROU ? DO YOU KNOW ?

962
01:23:36,334 --> 01:23:37,400
HE'S UP ON THE ROOF.

963
01:23:37,467 --> 01:23:40,000
SOME HUSH-HUSH OPERATION
ON THE DOCKS.

964
01:23:40,067 --> 01:23:41,534
 ARE YOU OKAY ?

965
01:23:55,901 --> 01:23:59,667
 <i>Air 54, you are not</i>
  <i>cleared for takeoff.</i>

966
01:23:59,734 --> 01:24:02,467
  <i>Repeat. Air 54, you are</i>
  <i>not cleared for takeoff.</i>

967
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:10,000
 CHIEF !

968
01:24:10,067 --> 01:24:15,300
CHIEF !

969
01:24:15,367 --> 01:24:19,100
 NO !

970
01:24:19,167 --> 01:24:20,634
 ( gun firing )

971
01:24:33,634 --> 01:24:35,968
 <i>Hey, Bob-meister, listen,</i>
 <i>I need a favor.</i>

972
01:24:36,033 --> 01:24:39,234
 FAVOR ?
 WHAT KIND OF FAVOR ?

973
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:40,567
 <i>Silver nitrate, you know,</i>

974
01:24:40,634 --> 01:24:42,100
 <i>the liquid kind,</i>
  <i>I need a mixture, man.</i>

975
01:24:42,167 --> 01:24:43,300
 OKAY.

976
01:24:43,367 --> 01:24:44,434
  <i>And I need it with</i>
  <i>some other drugs.</i>

977
01:24:44,501 --> 01:24:45,601
 ALL RIGHT.

978
01:24:45,667 --> 01:24:48,033
  <i>Yeah, morphine,</i>
  <i>Demerol, anything.</i>

979
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:49,501
 IF I CAN.

980
01:24:49,567 --> 01:24:50,567
  <i>Just make it strong.</i>

981
01:24:50,634 --> 01:24:51,868
 ALL RIGHT.

982
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:44,133
 ( Teague gasping )

983
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:47,133
 YOU WANT TEAGUE ?

984
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,601
 ( Teague )
 TELL THIS ANIMAL
TO LET ME GO.

985
01:25:49,667 --> 01:25:54,067
 LET THAT
 MOTHERFUCKER GO.

986
01:25:54,133 --> 01:25:55,400
 TAKE HIM.

987
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:07,767
 YOU FUCKING
 BASTARD.

988
01:26:07,834 --> 01:26:13,200
 A SILVER BULLET.

989
01:26:13,267 --> 01:26:14,767
 SO CLEVER.

990
01:26:21,767 --> 01:26:25,801
 GO AHEAD,
 MAKE YOUR DAY.

991
01:26:51,901 --> 01:26:53,434
 ( Perez )
 YOU KILLED HIM.

992
01:27:20,634 --> 01:27:21,667
 OUCH.

993
01:27:33,834 --> 01:27:36,200
 DIDN'T YOU
GET MY MEMO ?

994
01:27:36,267 --> 01:27:41,167
A FULL ECLIPSE PROTECTS
ME FROM EVERYTHING.

995
01:27:41,234 --> 01:27:42,868
 INCLUDING SILVER.

996
01:27:48,734 --> 01:27:52,300
NOW, YOU WANT TO SEE
SOMETHING REALLY SCARY ?

997
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,334
 NO !

998
01:28:40,234 --> 01:28:41,400
 ( crane engine starting )

999
01:29:07,601 --> 01:29:08,767
( growling )

1000
01:29:16,033 --> 01:29:17,534
( crane engine chugging )

1001
01:29:47,434 --> 01:29:48,934
( wind howling )

1002
01:29:55,801 --> 01:29:58,100
SUPER-COP SILVER
 COCKTAIL ! CHEERS !

1003
01:30:30,534 --> 01:30:31,901
 HEY, MAX.

1004
01:30:41,567 --> 01:30:45,634
 MAX...

1005
01:30:45,701 --> 01:30:50,467
DON'T LET IT ALL...
END HERE.

1006
01:30:50,534 --> 01:30:54,934
 LIE DOWN...
 IN MY BLOOD.

1007
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,834
TAKE MY POWER.

1008
01:30:57,901 --> 01:30:59,801
PROTECT THE INNOCENT.

1009
01:31:56,801 --> 01:31:58,133
 HEY, PRETTY LADY,
 YOU KNOW WHAT ?

1010
01:31:58,200 --> 01:31:59,601
HI. WHAT ?

1011
01:31:59,667 --> 01:32:03,400
ALL THIS GOOD AIR'S
 BAD FOR MY HEALTH.

1012
01:32:03,467 --> 01:32:05,167
BUT I THINK I'M STARTING
TO LIKE IT HERE.

1013
01:32:05,234 --> 01:32:06,367
 GREAT.

1014
01:32:06,434 --> 01:32:08,734
UNTIL WE HAVE
TO MOVE AGAIN.

1015
01:32:08,801 --> 01:32:13,067
HEY, I GOT ANOTHER
CONVICTION TODAY.

1016
01:32:13,133 --> 01:32:16,334
 YOU'RE SUCH
 A GOOD COP.

1017
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:17,400
 OUCH !

1018
01:32:26,367 --> 01:32:27,367
 MMMM.

1019
01:32:35,734 --> 01:32:36,334
I GOT WORK TO DO.
