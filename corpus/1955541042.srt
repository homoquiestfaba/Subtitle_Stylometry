2
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:55,464
Shakespeare said,
"Life was full of sound and fury,

3
00:01:55,464 --> 00:01:57,883
"and in the end, signified nothing."

4
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:02,763
Okay, let's begin with Helena.

5
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:09,895
-Cristal Delgiorno?
-Come in, my darling.

6
00:02:10,103 --> 00:02:11,730
I'm Helena Shepridge.

7
00:02:11,813 --> 00:02:13,899
-Ain't you beautiful?
-Thank you.

8
00:02:13,941 --> 00:02:15,901
Gabriella told me you wanted a reading.

9
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:18,570
She said you know the future.

10
00:02:19,154 --> 00:02:22,074
I adore Gabriella.
She's such a gifted masseuse.

11
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:24,785
I must say, I've become addicted
to those massages.

12
00:02:24,826 --> 00:02:27,829
They're the only thing that
relieves the throbbing in my neck.

13
00:02:27,955 --> 00:02:30,624
Will it be cash or check, darling?
Gabriella told you the fee?

14
00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:34,419
Believe me, it's far less expensive.
These fancy psychiatrists I've been seeing...

15
00:02:34,586 --> 00:02:36,797
-Have a little seat, then. Make yourself comfy.
-Thank you.

16
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,092
They sit there all stony-faced
when you need help.

17
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:44,096
These horrible, horrible medications,
they make me feel even more fidgety.

18
00:02:45,848 --> 00:02:48,141
Is there something I could sip on?

19
00:02:49,184 --> 00:02:50,602
Do you want a cup of tea?

20
00:02:51,186 --> 00:02:52,896
Have you any sherry?

21
00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:55,357
A little drinky. Scotch?

22
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:57,192
Even better.

23
00:02:58,485 --> 00:03:01,363
I want to tell you something, darling.

24
00:03:01,864 --> 00:03:04,074
My first impression of you

25
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:09,788
is a woman
who is constantly blaming herself.

26
00:03:09,788 --> 00:03:10,956
Am I right?

27
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,669
You're being too hard on yourself,
my darling.

28
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:18,922
Thank you.

29
00:03:21,508 --> 00:03:24,303
Well, you're very perceptive.

30
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,683
When my husband walked out on me,
I tried ending my life.

31
00:03:29,808 --> 00:03:32,186
Well, I imagine Gabriella told you
that little tale.

32
00:03:32,811 --> 00:03:34,646
She's such a gossip.

33
00:03:35,147 --> 00:03:37,399
I now realize that was foolish.

34
00:03:37,774 --> 00:03:39,902
I have everything to live for. I do, don't I?

35
00:03:39,985 --> 00:03:42,654
I mean, is that what you see?

36
00:03:42,779 --> 00:03:44,781
I mean, do you see...

37
00:03:44,781 --> 00:03:46,825
Is my future hopeful?

38
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,202
Shall I tell you something?

39
00:03:48,827 --> 00:03:52,748
I wish you were sitting here with me
because all I am seeing

40
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:57,920
is huge, cosmic waves
moving towards you, of positive energy.

41
00:03:58,003 --> 00:04:01,757
You're bathed in a rose light, my darling.

42
00:04:02,257 --> 00:04:05,719
You've got nothing but good coming to you,
I promise you.

43
00:04:07,054 --> 00:04:11,850
Well, 40 years of marriage is a long time.
One becomes terribly dependent.

44
00:04:12,017 --> 00:04:15,312
My husband walked out on me
for one simple reason,

45
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:17,356
I was too honest with him.

46
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:20,150
I refused to allow him to delude himself.

47
00:04:21,235 --> 00:04:24,488
Meet Helena's ex-husband, Alfie Shepridge.

48
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:29,451
He woke in the middle of the night,
pictured eternity, lay there in a cold sweat,

49
00:04:29,618 --> 00:04:32,579
and has not been able
to get back to sleep since.

50
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:35,499
Suddenly, it became
all jogging and health foods.

51
00:04:35,582 --> 00:04:37,793
And give me one more set of 1 2.

52
00:04:39,336 --> 00:04:41,672
-I can't, I've had enough.
-One, two...

53
00:04:41,713 --> 00:04:43,507
-Alfie, you're doing too much.
-...three, four...

54
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:44,716
-You'll kill your back again.
-...five...

55
00:04:44,716 --> 00:04:46,510
-He thinks he's 21 !
-...six.

56
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,512
Those days are over.
You're not a young man anymore.

57
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:49,513
Jesus.

58
00:04:49,513 --> 00:04:51,056
You do push-ups,

59
00:04:51,098 --> 00:04:53,100
but the clock still ticks. You can't fight time.

60
00:04:53,183 --> 00:04:55,394
You see?
She already has me dead and buried.

61
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,646
But there's longevity in my genes,
and that's what counts.

62
00:04:57,813 --> 00:04:59,106
Genes, right?

63
00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:01,567
Poor Helena.

64
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,152
She didn't understand
that truth is not beauty,

65
00:05:04,236 --> 00:05:06,989
as the poet said, but quite the opposite.

66
00:05:07,114 --> 00:05:08,031
Alfie dumped her.

67
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,785
He bought a sports car.
He took a flashy bachelor pad.

68
00:05:11,827 --> 00:05:14,621
Had his teeth whitened
and his skin darkened.

69
00:05:19,293 --> 00:05:21,753
And Helena? She took it like a trouper.

70
00:05:21,753 --> 00:05:25,340
She had a nervous breakdown
and popped 40 sleeping pills.

71
00:05:25,465 --> 00:05:29,511
She has become the official burden
of her only child, Sally.

72
00:05:29,553 --> 00:05:32,181
Sally, who married Roy.

73
00:05:32,514 --> 00:05:34,516
My daughter married badly.

74
00:05:34,516 --> 00:05:36,977
Waste of education.

75
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:39,980
He graduated from medical school
to give it all up to become a writer.

76
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:44,985
He's had one successful novel
and since then, he's failed over and over!

77
00:05:45,027 --> 00:05:48,572
He's a one-book phenomenon.
He can't accept that! Am I right?

78
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:52,242
I mean, do you see a future for him,
or was he just lucky the first time around?

79
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:55,329
I want you to bring me something of his,
something that he's had close to him,

80
00:05:55,412 --> 00:05:59,917
like a scarf or a glove
or a T-shirt, all right, darling?

81
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:01,752
I pay their bills!

82
00:06:01,877 --> 00:06:03,962
Sally can't survive on what she earns.

83
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:06,298
He doesn't work
so he can stay at home and write.

84
00:06:06,507 --> 00:06:09,092
He's been working on
the same bloody novel for years.

85
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,596
It's not entirely true,
what Helena tells her swami.

86
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:15,098
Roy tried a while ago to earn money.

87
00:06:15,182 --> 00:06:17,184
It's not that he didn't try.

88
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:19,811
He just wasn't much of a chauffeur.

89
00:06:22,481 --> 00:06:24,274
I've had it with that goddamned job.

90
00:06:24,274 --> 00:06:26,235
-What?
-That's it, I quit!

91
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,987
Please, Roy, not this conversation again!

92
00:06:29,112 --> 00:06:31,281
What are you doing home, anyway?

93
00:06:31,406 --> 00:06:32,824
What happened?

94
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:34,868
I had an accident today.
I smashed up the car.

95
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:35,953
What?

96
00:06:36,078 --> 00:06:39,414
I can't write all night
and then drive in the daytime!

97
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,291
-I fell asleep at the wheel.
-Oh, God.

98
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,710
Well, are you okay? Did anyone get hurt?

99
00:06:43,752 --> 00:06:46,672
Look, I need time to work on my book.

100
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:50,592
When are you gonna
finish that book, anyway?

101
00:06:50,717 --> 00:06:55,597
I mean, how many times can you write
and tear up and rewrite these chapters?

102
00:06:55,764 --> 00:06:58,183
-It's like you're scared to finish.
-Okay, you know what? You're right.

103
00:06:58,225 --> 00:06:59,518
I'm gun-shy.

104
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,478
I can't handle it if it's confirmed, yet again,

105
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:03,647
that all those nice things predicted about me
were wrong.

106
00:07:03,772 --> 00:07:05,315
That I was a flash in the pan.

107
00:07:05,357 --> 00:07:07,734
-Stalling is not the answer.
-Yeah.

108
00:07:07,776 --> 00:07:09,778
Jesus Christ.

109
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,030
You know, all my friends have families.

110
00:07:12,155 --> 00:07:14,199
And what are we doing here?

111
00:07:15,117 --> 00:07:18,412
One way or the other,
I want to move on with our lives.

112
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:38,015
Roy's attention was caught
by a lovely apparition

113
00:07:38,015 --> 00:07:40,767
moving into the flat across the way.

114
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,478
He and Sally fought so much now,

115
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:47,816
it was hard to imagine that
they fell so much in love when they first met.

116
00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:49,234
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine,

117
00:07:49,318 --> 00:07:50,986
but he came straight out in front of me.

118
00:07:51,028 --> 00:07:53,238
-It looks so painful.
-It's killing me.

119
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,407
-It's swollen all there.
-Yeah.

120
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:58,327
If you can move it, it's not broken.

121
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:03,916
My guess is that you strained the metatarsal.

122
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,628
-Are you a doctor?
-Unlicensed.

123
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:09,379
May I?

124
00:08:15,385 --> 00:08:18,597
-Her foot's okay?
-Oh, yeah, it's better than okay.

125
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:22,976
It's very pretty.

126
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,898
"So much depends

127
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:29,983
"upon a red wheelbarrow

128
00:08:32,402 --> 00:08:35,447
"glazed with rain water

129
00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:37,908
"beside the white chickens."

130
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:42,287
And Sally's ass.

131
00:08:46,124 --> 00:08:48,210
I'm paraphrasing, of course.

132
00:08:52,464 --> 00:08:56,051
You know, the day I graduated
from medical school was the day

133
00:08:56,176 --> 00:09:00,097
that I knew that
I would never practice medicine.

134
00:09:00,764 --> 00:09:02,182
There was no question in my mind

135
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:04,434
that I was gonna write,
and that I was gonna make it as a writer.

136
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,562
I mean, you know how you feel those things?

137
00:09:06,603 --> 00:09:08,647
And Roy's first book did make it.

138
00:09:08,689 --> 00:09:10,983
At least it showed real promise.

139
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:11,984
But that was then.

140
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:15,988
And as the years passed,
Sally put her dreams on hold

141
00:09:16,071 --> 00:09:17,322
and went to work.

142
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:20,909
Now, the hours are 24/7.

143
00:09:22,286 --> 00:09:25,289
The work involves everything from,
I don't know,

144
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:29,126
filing papers to keeping clients happy
and painters pampered,

145
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:31,753
to getting my lunches.

146
00:09:31,795 --> 00:09:34,256
So, what are your ambitions?

147
00:09:34,798 --> 00:09:39,887
Well, I've got a degree in art
and a background in art history,

148
00:09:40,304 --> 00:09:43,682
and I've worked for the museum
and some photographers.

149
00:09:44,057 --> 00:09:45,851
How did you hear about this job?

150
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,853
My friend, Jane Brooks,
who works at The Geller Gallery,

151
00:09:47,978 --> 00:09:49,396
she told me you were looking for someone.

152
00:09:49,438 --> 00:09:52,441
And when she said
it was The Clemente Gallery...

153
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,531
Well, you're going to school with the best.

154
00:09:59,615 --> 00:10:03,076
I've been working at The Geller Gallery
for four years now,

155
00:10:03,285 --> 00:10:08,874
and I've really had an education,
even though I can't stand Lois Geller.

156
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:11,502
Well, Greg's a dynamo.

157
00:10:11,543 --> 00:10:14,588
And I must say, extremely attractive.

158
00:10:14,713 --> 00:10:17,841
Sally, don't get a crush on your boss.

159
00:10:17,966 --> 00:10:20,302
That way lies total madness.

160
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:26,725
Roy was asked by Henry Strangler
to read his first novel and give an opinion.

161
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:30,103
And Strangler's first novel seemed
so much better than Roy's fourth,

162
00:10:30,187 --> 00:10:31,813
he grew discouraged.

163
00:10:32,814 --> 00:10:36,485
All that cheered him up was
the beautiful creature in red across the way,

164
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:40,280
whose life grew increasingly tantalizing
behind her windowpane.

165
00:11:07,891 --> 00:11:10,978
-I'm sorry. Am I disturbing you?
-No, not at all.

166
00:11:11,228 --> 00:11:13,021
I love the guitar.

167
00:11:13,397 --> 00:11:16,942
-Recently moved in?
-Just for the summer.

168
00:11:16,984 --> 00:11:19,486
-Should I close this window?
-No, I'm not working.

169
00:11:19,611 --> 00:11:22,114
I'm just reading a friend's new book.

170
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,494
It reads beautiful to Boccherini.

171
00:11:27,494 --> 00:11:29,663
Do you know his music?

172
00:11:30,247 --> 00:11:32,082
Quite impressed.

173
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:36,712
Well, anyway, if it gets too annoying,
just let me know and I'll stop, okay?

174
00:11:40,382 --> 00:11:42,009
-Anyone want a top-up?
-I would.

175
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,646
Hey.

176
00:11:54,688 --> 00:11:56,815
-I read your new book.
-What?

177
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,735
-I was overwhelmed.
-No.

178
00:11:59,818 --> 00:12:02,905
-No, you're kidding.
-Yes. My confidence is gone now.

179
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:06,033
-What? Don't be ridiculous.
-Yeah.

180
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:07,618
I'm speechless.

181
00:12:08,744 --> 00:12:10,412
You liked it?

182
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,747
Damn!

183
00:12:11,747 --> 00:12:14,208
Obviously, you know,
I haven't shown it to anybody before.

184
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,210
But I need to tweak a few things,
still, of course...

185
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,796
Of course it didn't hurt that I read it
to some very beautiful Boccherini,

186
00:12:19,796 --> 00:12:23,050
played on the guitar by that knockout,
whose name I still don't know.

187
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:26,178
-The woman in the window?
-Yes, the woman in the window.

188
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,097
Well, no wonder you're having trouble
finishing your bloody book.

189
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:32,226
-I finished it.
-No.

190
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:33,519
-I handed it in yesterday.
-Well done.

191
00:12:33,602 --> 00:12:35,103
No, I'm a nervous wreck.

192
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,064
I don't know what I'll do if it doesn't make it.

193
00:12:37,147 --> 00:12:39,066
-Come on.
-No, I don't know what I'll do.

194
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,485
I'll be chauffeuring
the goddamned limos again...

195
00:12:41,485 --> 00:12:42,945
-Rubbish!
-All my confidence is gone.

196
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,114
Because of you, partially,
my confidence is gone.

197
00:13:07,803 --> 00:13:09,221
Hello?

198
00:13:09,304 --> 00:13:11,223
Hi, Mum. Come in.

199
00:13:11,306 --> 00:13:13,433
Why does she have to
come over here so often?

200
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,103
I mean, it's once, twice. It's endless!

201
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:19,314
I'm trying to relax here.
My nerves are shot from waiting.

202
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,775
I know. She can't stand to be alone.

203
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,528
And, you know, I worry about her, Roy.

204
00:13:25,153 --> 00:13:27,531
She's taken to talking to herself a bit, lately.

205
00:13:27,698 --> 00:13:29,533
And you encourage her
with that phony mind-reader.

206
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,909
Well, okay, yes!

207
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,912
Cristal is a fake. We know that, but...

208
00:13:34,163 --> 00:13:37,374
Thank God she buys into it,
and it gives her peace of mind,

209
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,710
and don't you try and spoil it for her, please.

210
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:41,044
Okay, look, I'm not gonna say anything.

211
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:44,965
I just don't think you help her by going
into that garbage about foretelling her future.

212
00:13:45,007 --> 00:13:46,550
She needs medicine, not illusions.

213
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,761
No, not if the illusions
work better than the medicine.

214
00:13:52,014 --> 00:13:54,266
-Here I am, darling.
-Hi, Mum!

215
00:13:54,683 --> 00:13:58,687
I've just come from a session with Cristal.
That woman is uncanny.

216
00:13:59,313 --> 00:14:02,357
I know you have
a cold, scientific background, Roy.

217
00:14:02,524 --> 00:14:05,652
-Yes, I have a tough time with mumbo-jumbo.
-Roy, please!

218
00:14:05,652 --> 00:14:07,279
Look, if you feel better, then it's just...
I don't know.

219
00:14:07,321 --> 00:14:08,989
We discussed you.

220
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,657
She was very positive about your future.

221
00:14:10,741 --> 00:14:13,410
Though, to be perfectly candid,
she didn't see it in literature.

222
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,453
Well, that's too bad.

223
00:14:14,536 --> 00:14:16,288
Let's hope she's channeling
the wrong spirits.

224
00:14:16,413 --> 00:14:17,414
She's rarely wrong.

225
00:14:17,414 --> 00:14:19,708
Mum, Roy just handed in
his new novel this week.

226
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:22,169
He's on tenterhooks while they read it.

227
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:24,421
Well, I'm only saying
not to build your hopes up.

228
00:14:24,421 --> 00:14:26,715
-Cristal said...
-No, I don't care what Cristal said. Okay?

229
00:14:26,757 --> 00:14:29,426
Mum, nobody's infallible! Please! Let it...

230
00:14:29,551 --> 00:14:32,513
I know she's always right with your future,
but it doesn't mean she knows Roy's.

231
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:34,431
She's never even met him!

232
00:14:34,431 --> 00:14:37,309
She was very complimentary
in her readings about Roy,

233
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:40,604
just not necessarily as a writer.
Not at this point in time.

234
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:43,899
She did say one day,
perhaps, with maturity...

235
00:14:44,024 --> 00:14:47,152
Oh, by the way,
could I have another glove of yours?

236
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,696
I'm sorry, but she lost the first one.

237
00:14:49,863 --> 00:14:51,114
What glove?

238
00:14:52,115 --> 00:14:54,618
Did you give her my missing glove? Jesus!

239
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:00,874
Did he take the book home with him?

240
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,171
But no clue whether he could
get to it this weekend?

241
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:08,966
Okay. No, I'll call back.

242
00:15:37,494 --> 00:15:41,415
Okay, now let's go back
and take a look at Alfie Shepridge.

243
00:15:41,582 --> 00:15:42,624
Since his divorce,

244
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:45,419
Alfie Shepridge did not exactly find himself

245
00:15:45,586 --> 00:15:49,047
leading the thirtysomething life
he envisioned in his new digs.

246
00:15:56,847 --> 00:16:01,143
Friends fixed him up with one or two women
they thought might be appropriate.

247
00:16:01,185 --> 00:16:02,769
Always that word...

248
00:16:02,936 --> 00:16:04,271
But it was not what he had in mind.

249
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,275
I'm sorry about the stick,
but I've just had my hip replaced.

250
00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:11,486
At first, I thought I fell down and broke it.

251
00:16:11,528 --> 00:16:13,197
But what actually happened was,

252
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,782
it broke, and then I fell down.

253
00:16:15,991 --> 00:16:17,951
Do you see the difference?

254
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:21,371
He tried spending time
with younger colleagues from his firm,

255
00:16:21,371 --> 00:16:24,458
but he felt even more out of place
and ridiculous.

256
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:32,799
And then, one day, after months
of loneliness and awkward experiences,

257
00:16:32,841 --> 00:16:36,220
he took his daughter for a walk
and made a startling announcement.

258
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,473
I've met a woman, I'm very much in love,
I'm going to get married.

259
00:16:39,473 --> 00:16:41,975
-Isn't that fabulous?
-You're kidding.

260
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:43,852
No. You seem shocked.

261
00:16:44,728 --> 00:16:47,064
Is that what this walk's about?

262
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:48,857
So private and mysterious.

263
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,401
Well, I told your mother
and, you know, she was surprised,

264
00:16:51,485 --> 00:16:53,320
but she took it well.

265
00:16:53,487 --> 00:16:57,616
Apparently, this woman she's been seeing,
who gives her guidance about her future,

266
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,952
has given her a lot of strength emotionally.

267
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:03,413
Anyway, I would like you to
help choose some perfume with me.

268
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:04,748
Would you do that?

269
00:17:04,998 --> 00:17:07,793
So, who is this woman
you're going to marry?

270
00:17:09,002 --> 00:17:11,380
Her name is Charmaine.

271
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,049
She's an actress! Half his age!

272
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:16,051
This is all for the good.

273
00:17:16,051 --> 00:17:20,973
I've got a strong feeling that
this is a positive turning point in your life.

274
00:17:21,056 --> 00:17:25,477
But where is my life heading?
I need direction.

275
00:17:26,854 --> 00:17:31,316
-Is my future as empty as I feel it is?
-Listen. This is a pivotal moment.

276
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:34,236
Now, you've got several paths
to choose from.

277
00:17:34,361 --> 00:17:36,363
You've got to make sure
you choose the right one.

278
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:39,783
My darling! I'm seeing you triumphing.

279
00:17:41,034 --> 00:17:43,036
I'm seeing you with a new love.

280
00:17:43,036 --> 00:17:46,957
-What, a new love for me?
-I can see it! I can see it!

281
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,420
This development in your husband's life
can only be favorable to you.

282
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,839
You're saying I shall meet a new love?

283
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,716
And I'll tell you something else.

284
00:17:55,883 --> 00:17:59,887
Your husband will never love
this woman he's marrying

285
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,889
as much as he loved you.

286
00:18:01,972 --> 00:18:05,684
I've kept all his letters. They were so adoring.

287
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:09,188
Christ, no one wants to get old!
I don't want to get old!

288
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,648
And you're saying I won't be alone?

289
00:18:11,732 --> 00:18:14,568
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life alone.

290
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,195
Oh, my sweetheart.

291
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,948
You are entering a period of great fulfillment.

292
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,829
I'm seeing a handsome stranger
coming into your life.

293
00:18:27,623 --> 00:18:29,583
Powerful attraction.

294
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,085
You're like two magnets.

295
00:18:38,091 --> 00:18:43,680
Sally, can you call Lucien Moss
and get me out of my lunch tomorrow?

296
00:18:43,847 --> 00:18:45,474
-Reschedule?
-Well, yes.

297
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:47,893
-Tell him I'll call to reschedule, yeah.
-Okay.

298
00:18:48,018 --> 00:18:52,397
And arrange a flight to Venice
for my wife and myself for the 25th.

299
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:56,109
Which reminds me,
I need you to come with me this afternoon.

300
00:19:05,327 --> 00:19:08,080
Yes, they're lovely.
I particularly like that one.

301
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:11,792
Sally, could you please come?
Take a look at this.

302
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:14,545
-Which ones are you thinking of?
-These diamonds.

303
00:19:15,796 --> 00:19:17,798
Or the pearls.

304
00:19:18,674 --> 00:19:21,969
-Well, they're both beautiful.
-They are.

305
00:19:22,052 --> 00:19:25,681
Now, what's the best price
you'll give me on these?

306
00:19:25,848 --> 00:19:29,893
Well, these are Victorian diamonds.
Brilliant cut.

307
00:19:30,352 --> 00:19:32,855
These are $50,000.

308
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:35,899
These are what we call natural pearls.

309
00:19:35,983 --> 00:19:38,694
These are slightly later,
Edwardian, turn-of-the-century,

310
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,320
and these are $1 5,000.

311
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,825
Which would my wife prefer?

312
00:19:45,576 --> 00:19:47,286
What's she like?

313
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,998
-Remote.
-Remote?

314
00:19:52,374 --> 00:19:56,920
She loves diamonds, but, you know,
these pearls are so sexy.

315
00:19:57,671 --> 00:19:59,673
And so much less expensive.

316
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:04,261
-Would you like to try them on?
-They're not for me.

317
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:09,099
I understand, but perhaps it might help,
if the gentleman could see how they looked.

318
00:20:09,183 --> 00:20:11,476
-Shall I?
-If you don't mind.

319
00:20:11,602 --> 00:20:13,103
All right.

320
00:20:14,188 --> 00:20:16,565
-Let's see.
-Let's see.

321
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,156
-Very nice.
-Yeah.

322
00:20:25,782 --> 00:20:27,451
Yep, yep, yep.

323
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:30,204
Wow. Wow!

324
00:20:30,621 --> 00:20:32,164
Let me see.

325
00:20:33,415 --> 00:20:36,543
-They really frame your face beautifully.
-They do, sir.

326
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:40,005
Well, I do have a good shape
for long earrings.

327
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,507
You do.

328
00:20:41,882 --> 00:20:45,886
Well, you love these more than the pearls,
don't you?

329
00:20:46,053 --> 00:20:48,347
-I do. I'm afraid so.
-Okay, God.

330
00:20:48,472 --> 00:20:52,351
I hope, for this kind of money,
she looks as good in them as you do.

331
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,352
Yep.

332
00:20:55,395 --> 00:20:58,982
-Do I have to take them off?
-That's life, I'm afraid.

333
00:20:59,107 --> 00:21:00,859
-Sorry.
-Oh, well.

334
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,029
They were good for a minute.

335
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:07,616
Oh, I'm dying to see just what
my father thinks is so perfect for him.

336
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,786
-Can you tell I'm a little skeptical?
-Yeah. Why?

337
00:21:10,828 --> 00:21:13,413
I mean, who is she?
How long has he known her to marry her?

338
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,000
And why is some young actress
rushing off to marry him?

339
00:21:18,418 --> 00:21:20,587
An actress. Actress in what?

340
00:21:20,671 --> 00:21:23,715
-What's her name?
-Charmaine.

341
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,717
I keep wanting to say "chow mein."

342
00:21:25,843 --> 00:21:27,886
Why do you keep looking out the window?

343
00:21:28,011 --> 00:21:29,346
I don't.

344
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:32,057
You're so nervous. You seem edgy.
What's up?

345
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,643
Well, if I can hear something
about my book...

346
00:21:35,602 --> 00:21:38,772
-Oh, Christ, who's that?
-One guess!

347
00:21:49,825 --> 00:21:51,451
You look very lovely, darling.

348
00:21:51,618 --> 00:21:54,204
Forgive me for barging in.
I've just come from Cristal's.

349
00:21:54,204 --> 00:21:57,749
She had some things to say
about your father's upcoming wedding.

350
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:01,712
-Is there something I could sip on?
-Helena, you've sipped us dry.

351
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:05,716
Unless you're willing to try cooking sherry.
I'm just joking.

352
00:22:05,883 --> 00:22:09,011
By the way, she said you would hear
about your book any day now,

353
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:11,805
but not to be upset
if the verdict was negative.

354
00:22:11,889 --> 00:22:15,809
I hope Cristal put your mind at ease
about Dad's remarrying.

355
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:16,852
Cristal said...

356
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:21,148
She said he would never be as enchanted
with this other woman as he was with me.

357
00:22:21,231 --> 00:22:23,609
Well, I'm sure she's right.

358
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:27,821
-Have you met her?
-Actually, we're going to meet her tonight.

359
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:31,283
Dad's taking us to the park
for drinks and a concert.

360
00:22:32,993 --> 00:22:37,289
Cristal and I were talking about
a new love that I will soon be meeting.

361
00:22:37,414 --> 00:22:39,917
Wow. That's exciting news. Isn't it, Roy?

362
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:43,462
Yeah, you will meet a tall, dark stranger.

363
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:46,673
I will not be alone. I will find love.
I can rest assured.

364
00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:49,718
What does she charge you
for this message of hope?

365
00:22:49,885 --> 00:22:53,055
It's not hope, it's a certainty.
Cristal predicts it.

366
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,183
-He doesn't believe, Sally.
-No, I believe, unfortunately,

367
00:22:56,183 --> 00:23:00,270
that you will meet the same tall, dark stranger
that we all eventually meet.

368
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,981
And look where that cynicism has got you
over the years.

369
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,816
Cristal knows things
she couldn't possibly know

370
00:23:04,942 --> 00:23:05,817
if she wasn't blessed with a gift.

371
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,361
Look, did it ever occur to you

372
00:23:07,402 --> 00:23:09,821
that she might be getting her information
from your masseuse?

373
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,032
I mean, not to mention
what you give away without realizing it...

374
00:23:12,115 --> 00:23:13,367
-Roy!
-What?

375
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:16,203
She tells her what she wants to hear
and takes her money.

376
00:23:16,203 --> 00:23:17,746
Well, you take my money

377
00:23:17,913 --> 00:23:19,456
and certainly don't tell me
what I want to hear.

378
00:23:19,581 --> 00:23:22,668
Why can you two not be together
without tension?

379
00:23:22,751 --> 00:23:25,254
I'm just trying to prepare
your husband for a blow

380
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,713
should his work be rejected.

381
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:29,007
Well, my work will not be rejected.

382
00:23:29,091 --> 00:23:33,220
And if it is, this hustler you see
made a 50-50 guess.

383
00:23:33,262 --> 00:23:35,097
You see how that works?

384
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,682
Mum?

385
00:23:36,765 --> 00:23:40,185
Please, just give him a break.
He's vulnerable right now.

386
00:23:40,227 --> 00:23:43,230
Hasn't a spiritual bone in his body.
How can he write books?

387
00:23:43,272 --> 00:23:46,316
So, Cristal said you're gonna meet someone.

388
00:23:46,316 --> 00:23:48,777
Isn't that good news?

389
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:52,155
She also said that
you're perfectly able to conceive.

390
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,908
Well, of course I am, and you know that, too.

391
00:23:54,992 --> 00:23:58,620
Well, I couldn't after your brother died.

392
00:23:58,745 --> 00:24:01,707
I mean, the doctor said
it was psychological, but...

393
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:04,418
I couldn't give Alfie another child,
and he longed for a son.

394
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:07,337
Please, let's not relive everything constantly.

395
00:24:07,337 --> 00:24:09,339
Anyway, look, we must go.

396
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,405
There they are.

397
00:24:33,822 --> 00:24:35,073
Hello.

398
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:37,117
-This is Sally and this is Roy.
-Hello. All right?

399
00:24:37,201 --> 00:24:38,869
-Hey, how are you?
-Charmaine Foxx.

400
00:24:38,952 --> 00:24:39,870
-From America.
-Yeah.

401
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:41,872
You didn't tell me. Never tells me nothing.

402
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,123
Hello.

403
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:47,669
Don't want to flash everyone now. No.

404
00:24:49,004 --> 00:24:50,589
-Well.
-So...

405
00:25:01,975 --> 00:25:04,019
Dad said you were an actress.

406
00:25:04,353 --> 00:25:05,979
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

407
00:25:05,979 --> 00:25:10,901
I tried it in Hollywood for a while,
but if you don't know people, it...

408
00:25:11,985 --> 00:25:14,196
It's like a vicious circle, you know?

409
00:25:14,988 --> 00:25:16,114
Yeah.

410
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:19,284
So, what are your plans?

411
00:25:19,409 --> 00:25:20,494
I think...

412
00:25:20,536 --> 00:25:23,872
Well, her plans are, you know,
to be my wife, Mrs. Alfie Shepridge.

413
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:26,333
She's going to be the mother of my son.
The boy...

414
00:25:26,416 --> 00:25:29,753
One day I'll teach him football,
or something like that. Isn't that right?

415
00:25:31,922 --> 00:25:33,382
Anyway, she... You were in...

416
00:25:33,423 --> 00:25:36,969
-She was in a few movies, films, on TV.
-Stop it.

417
00:25:37,052 --> 00:25:39,179
-But you were.
-Just small parts.

418
00:25:39,388 --> 00:25:41,765
-What were the films?
-Science fiction.

419
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:47,020
I was the leader's daughter,
but from another galaxy.

420
00:25:47,187 --> 00:25:49,982
That's right up your street, Roy.
Roy is a doctor.

421
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:53,527
Well, actually, he wrote a novel
about a physicist,

422
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,988
-based on Werner Heisenberg, isn't it?
-Yeah.

423
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:57,614
Who?

424
00:25:58,282 --> 00:26:01,451
So, how long have you known each other?

425
00:26:01,451 --> 00:26:02,661
-Three months. No...
-No.

426
00:26:02,786 --> 00:26:05,038
-Two months.
-Two months. Yeah.

427
00:26:06,456 --> 00:26:09,084
So, you've actually just met.

428
00:26:09,918 --> 00:26:11,920
Well, we've spent every day together
since we did meet.

429
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,338
-And can you blame me?
-We have. Yeah.

430
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:17,634
I mean, I was besotted with
charming Charmaine from the very first day

431
00:26:17,801 --> 00:26:20,387
and it just, you know...

432
00:26:20,387 --> 00:26:21,388
So that's...

433
00:26:21,471 --> 00:26:22,681
So, how did you meet?

434
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:26,018
A mutual acquaintance introduced us.
That's how we met.

435
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:27,186
Yeah.

436
00:26:27,644 --> 00:26:29,980
Here, Alfie was not being truthful.

437
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,192
Technically, maybe,
but that wasn't the whole story.

438
00:26:35,152 --> 00:26:36,612
-Hello.
-Come in.

439
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:41,950
So, you're Charmiane.

440
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,119
-Charmaine.
-Charmiane.

441
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:47,998
Sorry. Come in.
Yeah, he said you were very pretty.

442
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,127
-My body's how I make my living, isn't it?
-Yes.

443
00:26:52,252 --> 00:26:54,838
-I'm always working out.
-Good. Well, me, too.

444
00:26:54,963 --> 00:26:56,798
Look, feel this.

445
00:26:59,593 --> 00:27:01,845
-Not bad.
-You're buff, ain't you?

446
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:03,639
Yeah.

447
00:27:03,764 --> 00:27:06,183
-Would you like a drink?
-Yeah. All right.

448
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:07,851
Good. Okay.

449
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:11,980
Geoffrey Sweeney gave me your number.

450
00:27:12,147 --> 00:27:13,815
-Geoffrey?
-Yeah.

451
00:27:13,815 --> 00:27:15,943
-Geoffrey...
-Yes.

452
00:27:15,984 --> 00:27:19,988
-God, I know millions of Geoffreys.
-Oh, yeah? Well, doesn't matter.

453
00:27:20,948 --> 00:27:22,783
You have to forgive me
if I seem a little awkward,

454
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,911
-but I don't usually do this sort of thing.
-Right.

455
00:27:26,703 --> 00:27:30,123
I assume it's hygienic and all,
you know what I mean?

456
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:32,125
-Hygienic?
-Yeah.

457
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:36,380
-Are you having a laugh?
-No, I'm just checking.

458
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:38,715
I won't give you AIDS,
if that's what you mean.

459
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,593
No, I wasn't thinking about AIDS. God, no.

460
00:27:41,635 --> 00:27:43,387
There's a man in my firm who's got herpes.

461
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:46,431
-No, relax, don't have to worry.
-All right. Yeah.

462
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:50,644
Basically, I'm an actress.
I'm just doing this part-time.

463
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:54,606
Good. You look pretty. Okay.

464
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:58,902
-Shall we settle the business?
-Oh, yeah. Okay.

465
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:01,738
-They told you it was 350, yeah?
-Yeah, okay.

466
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,741
Here's 500, and you can keep the change.
All right?

467
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,952
Oh, thank you.

468
00:28:06,994 --> 00:28:09,997
I mean, you know,
I wasn't thinking about AIDS.

469
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,253
Oi.

470
00:28:16,378 --> 00:28:18,547
-Shall we get on with it?
-What?

471
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,425
-Do you want to get on with it?
-Yeah.

472
00:28:22,176 --> 00:28:23,051
Okay.

473
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:32,644
-Forty years is a long time to be married.
-Yeah, it's almost half a century.

474
00:28:32,686 --> 00:28:36,523
What happened is that my wife, Helena,
she allowed herself to become old,

475
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:37,941
and I wasn't prepared
to accept that nonsense.

476
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:39,401
-No.
-Because you're as old as,

477
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:41,486
-or as young as you feel.
-Oh, definitely.

478
00:28:41,528 --> 00:28:43,655
And I'm not prepared for the graveyard
or the scrap yard yet.

479
00:28:43,739 --> 00:28:46,283
-Do you need any help?
-No.

480
00:28:46,283 --> 00:28:48,202
I find older guys very sexy.

481
00:28:48,285 --> 00:28:50,996
Well, we're experienced, and...

482
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:53,248
You know, we're not scrambling around
to make careers for ourselves

483
00:28:53,373 --> 00:28:55,250
-and all that nonsense, and...
-Oh, yeah.

484
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:58,837
You know, we like to make a woman
feel appreciated and all the rest of it and...

485
00:28:58,962 --> 00:29:02,216
You had a good time just now, didn't you,
when we were, you know, in bed?

486
00:29:02,257 --> 00:29:04,801
-You heard me screaming.
-Yes.

487
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:07,554
Could I see you again, do you think,
charming Charmaine?

488
00:29:07,638 --> 00:29:10,599
Yeah. I'll give you...

489
00:29:10,641 --> 00:29:12,351
I'll give you a number.
You can get me directly.

490
00:29:12,434 --> 00:29:13,727
-Okay.
-Oh, what is it?

491
00:29:14,102 --> 00:29:17,105
So one tumble with this pro,
and the poor guy's in love.

492
00:29:17,314 --> 00:29:19,399
He starts buying all her time.

493
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:23,487
And every time she screws him, he falls
deeper and deeper for the little mechanic.

494
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:27,199
Tell me, would you ever consider
letting me change your life?

495
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,701
What's wrong with my life?

496
00:29:29,743 --> 00:29:34,623
Well, I'm talking about marriage.
I don't mean the sort of marriage you had...

497
00:29:34,748 --> 00:29:39,294
Because at 1 6, what would you know
about love or living, or anything?

498
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:41,755
What do you think?

499
00:29:41,755 --> 00:29:44,800
-Marriage?
-Yeah. Well, why not?

500
00:29:44,967 --> 00:29:47,511
You know, you told me yourself,
every time you go out on a call

501
00:29:47,761 --> 00:29:51,515
you're taking your life in your own hands,
and I'm gonna be around a long time.

502
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,476
You know, there's longevity in my genes.

503
00:29:54,601 --> 00:29:56,603
Go on, hit me there. Go on.

504
00:29:57,688 --> 00:30:00,274
That cheap tart is what he left my mother for.

505
00:30:00,357 --> 00:30:01,942
Actress, my foot.

506
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,319
The only acting she's ever done
is faking an orgasm.

507
00:30:04,486 --> 00:30:05,904
Leave him alone.

508
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:08,198
You know, I never saw the guy so happy,
and who can blame him?

509
00:30:08,282 --> 00:30:10,659
-She's a hot little number.
-Yeah.

510
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:13,954
I bet you'd like to make love to Chow Mein.

511
00:30:14,037 --> 00:30:16,415
All I'm saying is live and let live.

512
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,960
He couldn't keep his hands off her.

513
00:30:20,043 --> 00:30:23,005
I found that whole public display
completely disgusting.

514
00:30:23,046 --> 00:30:25,340
-And did you see the ring he got her?
-Yeah.

515
00:30:25,382 --> 00:30:27,384
I'm telling you,
she'll take him for everything he's worth,

516
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:31,013
and then leave him pouring his heart out
to some barman.

517
00:30:31,305 --> 00:30:34,057
No, he's a big boy.
She'll put a charge in his battery.

518
00:30:34,057 --> 00:30:37,019
Maybe she'll give him
that son he always wanted.

519
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:41,690
How infuriating will it be if he has
his second family before I have my first.

520
00:30:41,732 --> 00:30:43,692
Okay, okay.

521
00:30:44,651 --> 00:30:47,321
You know, you looked really pretty tonight?

522
00:30:47,863 --> 00:30:49,698
Are those earrings new?

523
00:30:49,698 --> 00:30:50,782
-These?
-Yeah.

524
00:30:50,908 --> 00:30:52,659
I wear them every day.

525
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,954
They're just cheap junk.

526
00:31:01,752 --> 00:31:05,380
You always know how to hit on me
when I'm upset, don't you?

527
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:11,386
I really don't want to keep doing this
if we have to use contraception.

528
00:31:22,523 --> 00:31:25,651
To occupy her time and keep Helena active,

529
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:29,947
Alfie persuaded Peter and Enid Wicklow,
longtime friends of the family,

530
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:33,617
to hire her as a personal shopper
to supervise their wardrobe.

531
00:31:33,784 --> 00:31:34,785
Enid.

532
00:31:35,118 --> 00:31:36,620
I need your help.

533
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,248
I thought this for
when you go to your weekend house.

534
00:31:39,373 --> 00:31:40,874
Yes. Enid, I need your input.

535
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:44,586
I admit, it's quite pretty, but... Bold.

536
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:48,507
The question is, do I have
the courage of your convictions?

537
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:52,052
-Enid, is this okay?
-Yes, I love it. It's great.

538
00:31:53,303 --> 00:31:56,515
Helena, this is Peter's uncle, Jonathan.

539
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:58,684
-Hello, nice to meet you.
-Hello.

540
00:31:58,725 --> 00:32:01,311
Peter, it looks really smart.
You should heed this woman.

541
00:32:01,311 --> 00:32:04,273
She'll have you looking
like a country squire in no time.

542
00:32:05,315 --> 00:32:07,818
My flair has always been fashion.

543
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:13,949
I had a promising career as
a costume designer in the theater.

544
00:32:13,991 --> 00:32:15,200
But when I met my husband,

545
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:18,912
he didn't like me going away on tour
and leaving him alone.

546
00:32:19,121 --> 00:32:22,166
I can understand feeling possessive
towards a loved one.

547
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:24,543
I never wanted Claire to work.

548
00:32:24,585 --> 00:32:27,379
-Thank you for coming by, Jonathan.
-Oh, thank you for lunch.

549
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:28,297
I'm sorry I've got to go,

550
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,423
-but I'll see you on Sunday.
-Yes.

551
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,884
And you keep on after him.

552
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,928
He's looking more dapper
than I've seen him look in years.

553
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:37,681
You have a flair for the dramatic.

554
00:32:37,723 --> 00:32:39,057
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

555
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:42,269
-What a charming man.
-Yes.

556
00:32:42,477 --> 00:32:44,271
Poor Jonathan, his wife died recently

557
00:32:44,271 --> 00:32:46,690
and he's been trying so desperately
to contact her.

558
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:49,276
-Contact her?
-He owns an occult book shop.

559
00:32:49,318 --> 00:32:51,737
He's very devout, in a New Age way.

560
00:32:52,321 --> 00:32:54,698
Yes, this is Roy Channing.

561
00:32:54,781 --> 00:32:58,577
I wanted to find out the status of the book
I left with Malcolm Dodds.

562
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:03,081
Really? How long?

563
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:07,085
When will he be back in the country?

564
00:33:09,546 --> 00:33:11,840
If he calls in, can you let him know I phoned?

565
00:33:11,965 --> 00:33:14,134
I mean, not to push him, just to see?

566
00:33:15,052 --> 00:33:16,678
All right.

567
00:33:28,649 --> 00:33:33,529
Hello!

568
00:33:40,577 --> 00:33:44,122
-Was I too loud again?
-No. You want to have lunch?

569
00:33:44,164 --> 00:33:45,833
-Lunch?
-Yeah.

570
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:50,170
I don't know.
The weather's really bad, don't you think?

571
00:33:50,254 --> 00:33:54,550
Look, I'm going downstairs for lunch.
I'll bring an umbrella.

572
00:33:57,469 --> 00:34:00,973
I just have some more work.
I need half an hour more.

573
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,684
There's a great little place
right around the corner.

574
00:34:03,851 --> 00:34:06,895
Okay. Hey, why not?
Can you give me half an hour, though?

575
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:10,482
I'll walk around the block
and meet you in front of your house at 1 2:30.

576
00:34:10,524 --> 00:34:12,860
-All right?
-Perfect. See you then. Bye.

577
00:34:31,378 --> 00:34:33,589
-I'm Roy Channing.
-Hi, I'm Dia.

578
00:34:33,714 --> 00:34:35,048
-Dia?
-Dia.

579
00:34:35,132 --> 00:34:36,383
How exotic. I got it, I got it.

580
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:38,510
-Sure?
-Yeah. I got it.

581
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,554
Come on, it's right around the corner.

582
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:53,442
-So you're a professional musician?
-Oh, no. No.

583
00:34:53,567 --> 00:34:57,154
I'm just getting my PhD in musicology.

584
00:34:57,196 --> 00:34:59,114
I play a few instruments, though.

585
00:34:59,281 --> 00:35:01,450
Not too well.

586
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,785
Are you sure it doesn't bother you
when you're writing?

587
00:35:05,037 --> 00:35:06,580
You know I write.

588
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:09,082
You know, I can see you, too.

589
00:35:09,416 --> 00:35:13,045
No, you don't bother me. You inspire me.

590
00:35:13,086 --> 00:35:16,048
Perfect. I've always wanted to be
someone's muse.

591
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:20,385
I'll dedicate my next book
to the woman who's always in red.

592
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:22,763
Thank you.

593
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:26,683
You know, my father's a writer.
He does a lot of translations.

594
00:35:27,142 --> 00:35:29,811
Yeah, mostly Eastern European authors.

595
00:35:30,312 --> 00:35:31,313
Wow.

596
00:35:32,356 --> 00:35:35,442
Can I make a terrible confession,
even though I hardly know you?

597
00:35:35,984 --> 00:35:37,444
Yeah, sure.

598
00:35:38,821 --> 00:35:41,406
Before I heard you play the guitar,

599
00:35:41,448 --> 00:35:44,368
I noticed you, one night,
just before I went to bed,

600
00:35:44,451 --> 00:35:48,789
and you were slipping out of a red dress,

601
00:35:48,831 --> 00:35:53,418
and I thought it was the most erotic
1 5 seconds I'd ever seen.

602
00:35:55,295 --> 00:35:57,047
-Okay.
-I'm sorry.

603
00:35:58,882 --> 00:36:01,927
Okay, that's flattering, I guess.

604
00:36:03,637 --> 00:36:06,306
A nice-looking man came in

605
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,810
and he put his arms around you,
and he turned you to him, and he kissed you.

606
00:36:09,893 --> 00:36:12,020
And with his free hand,
he snapped out the lights,

607
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:16,483
and I thought, whoever this guy is,
he's very, very lucky.

608
00:36:18,485 --> 00:36:21,280
That's Alan, my fiance.

609
00:36:24,116 --> 00:36:25,325
Thank you.

610
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:30,956
He doesn't seem to live there?

611
00:36:31,498 --> 00:36:34,668
You've been watching me for a while,
haven't you?

612
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:37,337
Yeah, no, you're right, though.
He doesn't live there.

613
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:40,674
He works in Brussels, for the Foreign Office,

614
00:36:40,757 --> 00:36:42,718
so he's over only when he's in town.

615
00:36:45,053 --> 00:36:48,182
-Bon appetit.
-Bon appetit to you, too. Thank you.

616
00:36:49,683 --> 00:36:52,686
So I began the novel, it took, like, two years.

617
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:55,147
Some days I love it,
and some days I just panic.

618
00:36:55,147 --> 00:36:56,773
-You should show it to my father.
-Yeah?

619
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:57,816
You should, yeah.

620
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,360
Dad's really sensitive and insightful
when it comes to literature,

621
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,987
and you two would have
so much to talk about.

622
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:05,157
I'd love to.
Hey, promise me one thing, would you?

623
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:08,785
Two things, actually.
We can have lunch again,

624
00:37:08,827 --> 00:37:10,829
and that you won't suddenly start
pulling your window shades down

625
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:12,998
when you undress.

626
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:17,920
-You're very flirtatious, aren't you?
-Am I?

627
00:37:18,086 --> 00:37:20,714
-Anyway, thanks for the lunch, Roy.
-Yeah.

628
00:37:22,174 --> 00:37:24,051
And I'll tell you what.

629
00:37:24,134 --> 00:37:27,721
Why don't you look out your window
around midnight?

630
00:37:29,097 --> 00:37:33,018
And you stuck at it all these years.
I'm so impressed.

631
00:37:33,101 --> 00:37:36,355
-Don't you just love them?
-I agree. You're right.

632
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,398
They're very interesting.
Congratulations, very good job.

633
00:37:38,482 --> 00:37:40,651
Yeah? Well, thank you. Thanks.
I'm really excited if you like that.

634
00:37:40,818 --> 00:37:41,819
That's great.

635
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,986
We went to school together,

636
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:45,614
and I always knew
she just showed so much promise.

637
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:48,242
And Sally was my very first supporter,
when no one else knew what I was on about

638
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:50,452
with my big, red flowers.
She was the only one that got it.

639
00:37:50,577 --> 00:37:53,580
You know, I really love that one.

640
00:37:53,664 --> 00:37:56,250
-Hello?
-Oh, well, see, your problem was

641
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,710
you never believed in yourself
as much as everyone believed in you.

642
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,170
Yeah, well, I'm clean now.

643
00:38:00,254 --> 00:38:03,882
I haven't had a drink or taken drugs in,
like, two years.

644
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:07,511
Well, Greg will market you brilliantly,
and you are gonna make so much money.

645
00:38:07,678 --> 00:38:08,804
Trust me.

646
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:12,015
I'm so happy for you.
I mean, you work at a top art gallery...

647
00:38:12,057 --> 00:38:15,185
-Oh, please, I get his lunches.
-You're married to a top author.

648
00:38:15,185 --> 00:38:17,980
I mean, we all knew at school
you'd end up being special. We said it.

649
00:38:18,021 --> 00:38:19,606
How is Roy? What's he up to?

650
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:24,653
Well, he's just finished his new novel
and we're having a baby.

651
00:38:24,778 --> 00:38:26,613
-You are?
-I mean, we're planning to have a baby.

652
00:38:26,613 --> 00:38:29,825
-I shouldn't be smoking, should I?
-Oh, no. Not yet.

653
00:38:31,618 --> 00:38:32,953
Interesting painter, you know.

654
00:38:32,995 --> 00:38:38,500
I mean, we could do a show with her
and Homer Novello and maybe Will Harmon.

655
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:42,337
My long-standing faith in her
has finally been vindicated.

656
00:38:42,504 --> 00:38:44,673
Hey, listen, I don't know if you are interested,

657
00:38:44,715 --> 00:38:48,385
but can I offer you two tickets
for Lucia di Lammermoortonight?

658
00:38:48,468 --> 00:38:50,804
I mean, my wife just called
and she cannot go,

659
00:38:50,888 --> 00:38:54,558
so I thought maybe you can take the tickets
and go with your husband.

660
00:38:54,641 --> 00:38:57,186
Well, isn't there somebody else
you want to ask before...

661
00:38:57,352 --> 00:38:59,980
Not in such a short notice, actually.

662
00:39:00,063 --> 00:39:03,734
Oh, jeez. Well, tonight's Roy's poker night.

663
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:06,195
Anyway, he's far too antsy
to sit through anything.

664
00:39:06,236 --> 00:39:09,364
Maybe you can find some friends to go with?

665
00:39:09,406 --> 00:39:11,617
You mentioned
how much you liked Donizetti.

666
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:15,120
I love it. I just never get to go to the opera.
Tickets are way too expensive.

667
00:39:15,204 --> 00:39:17,080
Listen, look.

668
00:39:17,206 --> 00:39:18,540
Take this and...

669
00:39:18,707 --> 00:39:22,711
Or, if you don't mind, we could go together.

670
00:39:24,087 --> 00:39:27,257
-Yeah...
-Unless you have other plans this evening.

671
00:39:27,382 --> 00:39:29,593
-No, I'm dying to see it...
-Really?

672
00:39:29,676 --> 00:39:32,221
-I'd love to go.
-Good. Great.

673
00:39:32,304 --> 00:39:33,514
Okay.

674
00:39:34,389 --> 00:39:37,184
-All right. There you go.
-Thank you.

675
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:18,559
Okay.

676
00:40:25,148 --> 00:40:30,404
Thank you for a wonderful opera
and wonderful Irish coffee.

677
00:40:31,405 --> 00:40:34,616
I'm afraid I had too many of them.

678
00:40:34,616 --> 00:40:39,454
I hope I didn't get morose
and bore you with my matrimonial agonies.

679
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:43,250
I'll be embarrassed tomorrow
when the whiskey wears off.

680
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:45,419
No, not at all.

681
00:40:45,502 --> 00:40:50,382
In fact, I kind of suspected
from the things you've said.

682
00:40:53,969 --> 00:40:59,224
Are you gonna be able to
drive all the way to Maida Vale?

683
00:41:00,267 --> 00:41:02,603
Are you insinuating that
I can't drive while drunk,

684
00:41:02,728 --> 00:41:05,147
just because
I left my contact lenses at home?

685
00:41:05,147 --> 00:41:06,982
Oh, God...

686
00:41:08,192 --> 00:41:10,110
I'll be fine.

687
00:41:15,782 --> 00:41:19,286
Thanks for coming with me tonight.

688
00:41:19,328 --> 00:41:24,333
And thanks for keeping your eyes open

689
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:27,794
for new talent for the gallery.

690
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,633
And thanks for all the

691
00:41:35,219 --> 00:41:37,429
chocolate truffles.

692
00:41:54,071 --> 00:41:55,614
Well...

693
00:41:58,408 --> 00:42:01,745
-I'll see you tomorrow?
-Yeah.

694
00:42:23,934 --> 00:42:26,603
As the days passed
with no word on his book,

695
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,480
Roy grew more anxious.

696
00:42:28,564 --> 00:42:33,485
He looked forward to his afternoons with Dia,
which became longer and more frequent.

697
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,196
-Enough about me.
-Okay, okay...

698
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,283
-I have one, but only one.
-All right.

699
00:42:40,492 --> 00:42:43,537
So I'm all set to get married
at the end of the summer,

700
00:42:43,745 --> 00:42:47,583
and sometimes I have these moments
when I feel intense panic

701
00:42:47,749 --> 00:42:50,252
and, I don't know, I just want to call it off.

702
00:42:50,335 --> 00:42:52,629
-Do you love the guy?
-Yes, I do.

703
00:42:52,796 --> 00:42:56,216
I love the guy, but...
I don't know, I just waver.

704
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,759
"Waver"? Why?

705
00:42:59,386 --> 00:43:02,723
Now that you and I have been having lunch
and taking these long walks

706
00:43:02,806 --> 00:43:05,434
and you shamelessly flirt with me,

707
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,812
and I actually find myself
enjoying the flirtation.

708
00:43:09,438 --> 00:43:11,690
I mean, should I be doing this?

709
00:43:12,983 --> 00:43:16,987
I'm so confused. If I'm getting married,
then why am I flirting back?

710
00:43:17,988 --> 00:43:19,156
Are you?

711
00:43:23,327 --> 00:43:26,288
I told you I'd take care of you, didn't I?

712
00:43:26,455 --> 00:43:28,540
It's like proper...

713
00:43:32,085 --> 00:43:34,421
-I'm loving this, Alfie. It's so me.
-Good.

714
00:43:34,588 --> 00:43:35,964
-That's the Albert Bridge, there.
-Yeah.

715
00:43:36,048 --> 00:43:38,091
And that's the Tower there.
Harrods is up there.

716
00:43:38,217 --> 00:43:40,552
-And you got me all that silk underwear.
-Yeah.

717
00:43:40,594 --> 00:43:42,262
There you are.

718
00:43:42,387 --> 00:43:44,014
-I told you I'd take care of...
-It cost you so much.

719
00:43:44,181 --> 00:43:46,683
Well, what's money? It doesn't matter.

720
00:44:08,664 --> 00:44:10,082
-Alfie?
-Yeah.

721
00:44:10,666 --> 00:44:13,043
-What do you think?
-Wow. That looks amazing.

722
00:44:13,168 --> 00:44:15,170
-You like it?
-Yeah, it's beautiful.

723
00:44:16,004 --> 00:44:18,715
The silk feels so good on my skin.

724
00:44:18,841 --> 00:44:22,177
It's a shame they haven't brought the bed,
isn't it? Sorry about that.

725
00:44:22,219 --> 00:44:23,846
-We don't need a bed.
-No?

726
00:44:23,846 --> 00:44:26,557
We could just do it here.

727
00:44:26,598 --> 00:44:28,851
-I've done it on a hardwood floor.
-You have?

728
00:44:28,976 --> 00:44:31,895
-Marble, even.
-It's a bit uncomfortable, isn't it?

729
00:44:32,646 --> 00:44:33,981
Wait, look.

730
00:44:35,983 --> 00:44:37,609
Just lay out the fox.

731
00:44:37,693 --> 00:44:39,069
-Be nice.
-Okay, well...

732
00:44:39,153 --> 00:44:41,155
-Cozy, like that.
-Yeah.

733
00:44:42,698 --> 00:44:45,993
-Come on.
-I just need a few more minutes, that's all.

734
00:44:47,786 --> 00:44:48,871
Why?

735
00:44:49,746 --> 00:44:55,502
Just to savor the moment
of looking at you, that's all.

736
00:45:02,801 --> 00:45:06,430
Was you serious when you said
you liked how that bracelet looked on me?

737
00:45:07,181 --> 00:45:08,348
Just now, at Cartier?

738
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:15,647
'Cause you said if I really felt like
I couldn't live without it...

739
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:18,942
And you've decided you can't live without it.

740
00:45:26,408 --> 00:45:27,993
Three more minutes.

741
00:45:30,204 --> 00:45:32,998
I've got such a crush on my boss.

742
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,583
I know he's married. I'm married.

743
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:37,294
But honestly, if he asked me
to run off with him tomorrow,

744
00:45:37,377 --> 00:45:40,214
I'd have to take a long, hard look at my life.

745
00:45:40,255 --> 00:45:42,799
Not that he necessarily shares
the same feelings.

746
00:45:42,966 --> 00:45:46,303
-Does he know your feelings?
-He knows I'm fond of him.

747
00:45:47,429 --> 00:45:49,640
He did take me to the opera one night.

748
00:45:49,806 --> 00:45:52,226
God, listen to me.
I sound like a crazy person.

749
00:45:53,477 --> 00:45:56,271
-You're the wrong person to ask.
-Ask what?

750
00:45:57,397 --> 00:46:02,152
I was going to take you out for a drink
and ask you to start a new gallery with me.

751
00:46:03,445 --> 00:46:06,949
Are you joking? Our own business?
That's my dream.

752
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:10,202
Listen, a number of clients and artists
would dump Lois Geller in a heartbeat

753
00:46:10,285 --> 00:46:11,328
and come with me.

754
00:46:11,453 --> 00:46:13,747
And you have such a good eye
for the new painters.

755
00:46:13,914 --> 00:46:17,918
I mean, yes, it's expensive,
but if we each raise half the money...

756
00:46:19,253 --> 00:46:20,838
I just can't believe this.

757
00:46:20,963 --> 00:46:22,548
The timing's right.

758
00:46:33,308 --> 00:46:36,061
Can you believe he wound up
with that hot little wet dream?

759
00:46:36,103 --> 00:46:39,648
She's unbelievable. Look. Look.
Whatever it costs him, it's worth it.

760
00:46:39,731 --> 00:46:42,568
That body. I bet she's an acrobat.

761
00:46:43,652 --> 00:46:47,698
I'll bet she knows a few tricks.
I wonder if she plays around?

762
00:46:47,698 --> 00:46:49,324
I got to find out.

763
00:46:49,867 --> 00:46:51,702
-No.
-Life's a risk, boys.

764
00:46:51,743 --> 00:46:53,829
You going to pump iron, then?

765
00:46:53,954 --> 00:46:56,248
No. She's out of your league, man.
Don't you...

766
00:46:56,373 --> 00:46:58,250
-You gonna?
-Yeah.

767
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,877
If you don't, I will.

768
00:47:01,461 --> 00:47:05,841
I think I prefer this one, just slightly.
The brightness.

769
00:47:05,841 --> 00:47:08,844
Yeah. Didn't he say that he wanted me
to include this one, too?

770
00:47:09,011 --> 00:47:12,014
Yeah, definitely. Let's not forget this.
This is brilliant.

771
00:47:12,139 --> 00:47:14,266
I mean, the blue, it's just...

772
00:47:15,058 --> 00:47:18,312
And side by side, I think.
They'll be really good side by side.

773
00:47:18,395 --> 00:47:20,522
Do you want a drink? Tea or water?

774
00:47:20,564 --> 00:47:22,649
Tea is lovely, thank you.

775
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:26,320
I told you he'd do a great job
of promoting you.

776
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,488
He's a dynamo.

777
00:47:27,488 --> 00:47:29,406
He thinks the world of you.

778
00:47:29,406 --> 00:47:32,826
Really? Why? Did he say something?

779
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:36,747
Well, he obviously has enormous respect
for yourjudgment,

780
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:38,832
and supposedly a total dependency

781
00:47:38,957 --> 00:47:41,084
on the chocolate truffles
you turned him on to.

782
00:47:43,003 --> 00:47:46,840
Yeah, it's funny. I have a confession.

783
00:47:48,509 --> 00:47:51,053
I've come to the conclusion that...

784
00:47:54,848 --> 00:47:56,099
Have you...

785
00:47:56,934 --> 00:47:58,602
Have you always had those earrings?

786
00:47:58,685 --> 00:48:02,898
These pearls? No, they're new.

787
00:48:05,317 --> 00:48:06,527
Where did you get them?

788
00:48:06,902 --> 00:48:08,153
They were a gift.

789
00:48:09,321 --> 00:48:10,322
A gift.

790
00:48:10,948 --> 00:48:14,952
All right, you have to promise
that you won't tell anybody, okay?

791
00:48:14,952 --> 00:48:18,163
They're from Greg.

792
00:48:20,582 --> 00:48:21,667
What?

793
00:48:22,334 --> 00:48:24,336
Yeah, they're from Greg.

794
00:48:25,337 --> 00:48:27,297
I shouldn't even be blabbing about this,

795
00:48:29,633 --> 00:48:33,470
but we've kind of been having
a little something together.

796
00:48:34,012 --> 00:48:35,055
A what?

797
00:48:37,057 --> 00:48:38,267
An affair.

798
00:48:39,351 --> 00:48:42,479
It sounds so dramatic, doesn't it?
But that's what it is.

799
00:48:42,521 --> 00:48:45,065
We've been having an affair.

800
00:48:45,858 --> 00:48:48,485
Please, don't look so shell-shocked. Don't.

801
00:48:48,527 --> 00:48:49,820
He's married.

802
00:48:49,862 --> 00:48:52,030
Yeah, but we all know
what a shambles that is,

803
00:48:52,156 --> 00:48:53,824
and it's not because of me.

804
00:48:53,949 --> 00:48:57,494
I don't know, it just all got very serious,
very quickly.

805
00:48:57,578 --> 00:48:58,620
Since when?

806
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:02,541
For a while now. At first, we just met
and we talked about my work.

807
00:49:03,917 --> 00:49:06,295
He is so perceptive. And then he told me...

808
00:49:07,004 --> 00:49:09,548
He told me I wandered into his dream,

809
00:49:10,215 --> 00:49:11,550
and he put his hand on mine

810
00:49:11,633 --> 00:49:13,927
and told me how miserable he was at home

811
00:49:14,052 --> 00:49:17,472
and, well, things just went from there.

812
00:49:18,515 --> 00:49:20,267
He's a fabulous lover, and...

813
00:49:22,019 --> 00:49:23,896
I just don't know.
I don't want him to leave his wife for me,

814
00:49:23,937 --> 00:49:25,856
and he was going to do that already.

815
00:49:28,525 --> 00:49:32,571
I don't know, it feels like I'm in a soap opera,
but it's so lovely.

816
00:49:32,905 --> 00:49:34,948
But I don't know if it's just a reaction,

817
00:49:34,948 --> 00:49:38,869
you know, after spending six years
with a wife that's bipolar.

818
00:49:39,453 --> 00:49:40,954
I don't know.

819
00:49:42,539 --> 00:49:43,749
Are you okay?

820
00:49:45,834 --> 00:49:48,795
Will you please not leave
your bicycle in the hallway?

821
00:49:48,837 --> 00:49:50,631
I nearly broke my neck.

822
00:49:51,048 --> 00:49:54,218
-What's the matter?
-Nothing. Did you hear anything?

823
00:49:54,218 --> 00:49:55,219
About?

824
00:49:55,219 --> 00:49:58,138
What the hell do you think about?
Your book!

825
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:01,475
Hey, back off! What is eating you?

826
00:50:01,558 --> 00:50:05,270
I've been by the goddamned phone all day!
What's the problem?

827
00:50:05,521 --> 00:50:09,525
I can't stand working for Greg Clemente!
He treats me like a fucking secretary!

828
00:50:09,525 --> 00:50:13,570
Book his tables, get his lunches,
arrange his theater tickets!

829
00:50:13,654 --> 00:50:15,948
I need my own gallery!

830
00:50:17,491 --> 00:50:19,660
I've got a headache. My head is splitting!

831
00:50:19,785 --> 00:50:21,161
Take your pills.

832
00:50:21,245 --> 00:50:24,331
What the hell do you think
I'm trying to do here?

833
00:50:25,123 --> 00:50:26,917
Where are they? Excuse me.

834
00:50:27,042 --> 00:50:29,419
I thought you liked working for him.

835
00:50:30,254 --> 00:50:32,381
I need to start a family!

836
00:50:33,674 --> 00:50:37,594
You know, I wouldn't have to be doing this
if you could just support us.

837
00:50:37,719 --> 00:50:40,138
You know what? You've had trouble
on your last three jobs.

838
00:50:40,138 --> 00:50:41,765
Maybe it's not always your employers.

839
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:44,685
Yeah? What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

840
00:50:44,852 --> 00:50:46,937
Look, start your own art gallery!

841
00:50:47,729 --> 00:50:49,314
And with what?

842
00:50:49,314 --> 00:50:51,316
We can't afford to
pay the food and rent around here

843
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:52,401
without my mother helping!

844
00:50:52,484 --> 00:50:55,571
Hey, you have a migraine!
Don't take it out on me!

845
00:51:01,201 --> 00:51:02,244
Hello.

846
00:51:02,578 --> 00:51:04,580
Roy? Malcolm Dodds.

847
00:51:05,789 --> 00:51:06,957
Hello.

848
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:11,044
Hi. Look, we are so sorry that
we've held you up for so long on this book.

849
00:51:11,044 --> 00:51:13,589
But there's been a lot of talk about it up here,

850
00:51:13,589 --> 00:51:18,051
and we've decided
it's not going to work for us.

851
00:51:20,137 --> 00:51:21,096
And?

852
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:23,432
I mean, obviously, we liked it.

853
00:51:23,515 --> 00:51:26,476
But it's not that different
to something else we're going to publish,

854
00:51:26,476 --> 00:51:29,062
and we didn't want two books
with the same idea.

855
00:51:29,521 --> 00:51:30,689
I see.

856
00:51:34,693 --> 00:51:36,820
But in the end, you preferred the other one.

857
00:51:36,987 --> 00:51:40,782
To be perfectly frank, Roy,
there are nice moments in it.

858
00:51:40,782 --> 00:51:44,453
But a lot of people here
didn't think it was your best work.

859
00:51:44,578 --> 00:51:46,622
Anyway, I hope you're going to try us again.

860
00:51:47,289 --> 00:51:49,249
What if I can rewrite it?

861
00:51:51,293 --> 00:51:52,461
Am I disturbing you?

862
00:51:52,503 --> 00:51:54,880
Mum, can't you call sometimes
before you come over?

863
00:51:55,047 --> 00:51:56,507
I've got a horrible headache.

864
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:59,343
-Migraines are tension, darling.
-Yes, I know what migraines are!

865
00:51:59,343 --> 00:52:02,137
And I need to change my life.

866
00:52:02,262 --> 00:52:05,098
You shouldn't be working.
You should be raising a family.

867
00:52:05,182 --> 00:52:07,392
I really don't want
to discuss this right now, Mum.

868
00:52:07,476 --> 00:52:09,728
Well, I've come to share
an incredible insight.

869
00:52:09,812 --> 00:52:12,981
I've spent two hours with Cristal Delgiorno,
two riveting hours.

870
00:52:12,981 --> 00:52:14,149
I'm not in the mood.

871
00:52:14,191 --> 00:52:16,777
I'm just not in the mood
to get into any of that right now.

872
00:52:16,985 --> 00:52:17,820
Can I help myself to a drink?

873
00:52:17,903 --> 00:52:19,613
For some reason,
I love your brand of whiskey.

874
00:52:19,655 --> 00:52:21,031
I'm not normally a whiskey drinker.

875
00:52:21,198 --> 00:52:23,617
Well, that's it. They rejected my novel.

876
00:52:23,784 --> 00:52:25,828
-Roy.
-They don't think it comes off.

877
00:52:25,994 --> 00:52:28,163
Not my best work, try harder.

878
00:52:28,622 --> 00:52:31,208
After all this time,
leaving you dangling like that.

879
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:33,794
I can't try harder. That's all I have in me.

880
00:52:33,877 --> 00:52:36,547
You gave them sections to read.
They seemed okay with it.

881
00:52:36,672 --> 00:52:39,258
They seemed to like sections,
but the whole book...

882
00:52:39,341 --> 00:52:41,510
-Can I tell you an insight?
-What? What is it?

883
00:52:41,635 --> 00:52:44,346
Well, I know
you're going to pooh-pooh this, Roy,

884
00:52:44,346 --> 00:52:45,681
being so scientific minded,

885
00:52:45,806 --> 00:52:49,059
but it turns out that I've lived before.

886
00:52:49,142 --> 00:52:50,686
No. No, Mother!

887
00:52:50,686 --> 00:52:53,981
No, I've existed before in other incarnations!
Cristal is certain of it.

888
00:52:54,022 --> 00:52:56,692
Look, Helena, I'm not in the mood
for that crap right now, okay?

889
00:52:56,775 --> 00:52:57,901
-No, no, no. I'm not.
-But...

890
00:52:57,985 --> 00:53:01,321
But you will be in the mood
when you realize the importance of that fact.

891
00:53:01,405 --> 00:53:03,574
If it's so for me, it's so for everyone.
You, as well.

892
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,200
Make her shut up, Sally. I'm going to kill her.

893
00:53:05,284 --> 00:53:09,163
Please, let's not get ugly here.
Mum, he just got some really bad news.

894
00:53:09,246 --> 00:53:13,000
If you mean the rejection of that silly book,
I tried to prepare you for it.

895
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,001
Cristal predicted it.

896
00:53:14,084 --> 00:53:15,711
I was sure the book came off fine.

897
00:53:15,794 --> 00:53:17,296
Am I that blind about my own work?

898
00:53:17,421 --> 00:53:20,257
Cristal says your future is not in the arts.

899
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:22,134
I'm telling you, Sally,
get her out of here! Out!

900
00:53:22,301 --> 00:53:25,888
Well, what's wrong with medicine?
You have the education.

901
00:53:26,013 --> 00:53:29,349
If writing is not in your future,
medicine is a noble way to earn a living.

902
00:53:29,349 --> 00:53:31,185
Okay, all right... Are you thick?

903
00:53:31,351 --> 00:53:34,563
I am never going to be a doctor, okay?
That boat sailed years ago, okay?

904
00:53:34,646 --> 00:53:38,650
You got it? Maybe I'll be
a chauffeur or a messenger.

905
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:41,403
So, your daughter married badly.
Now can you get the hell out?

906
00:53:41,403 --> 00:53:45,449
How can you ask her to get out
when she is the one paying the rent?

907
00:53:45,449 --> 00:53:47,993
I'm sick of hearing that. She'll get it back,
she'll get all the money back!

908
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,786
How will she get it back?

909
00:53:49,828 --> 00:53:51,413
What are you gonna do, rob a bank?

910
00:53:51,497 --> 00:53:55,250
I am sick and tired of sitting around,
watching my life evaporate,

911
00:53:55,334 --> 00:53:56,919
while you keep trying to prove a point!

912
00:53:57,085 --> 00:53:59,880
It's all futile. Cristal said it's not his moment.

913
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,633
Arcadia was the only one interested,
but they're knowledgeable men,

914
00:54:02,716 --> 00:54:04,051
so I guess it doesn't come off!

915
00:54:04,218 --> 00:54:07,387
Cristal was right! I have to face it!
I was a one-book fluke!

916
00:54:07,513 --> 00:54:09,890
Cristal said at some point,
in the distant future.

917
00:54:10,015 --> 00:54:11,350
Maybe she was talking about another life.

918
00:54:11,391 --> 00:54:16,146
Mother! Will you be still?
You drink and chatter incessantly!

919
00:54:16,605 --> 00:54:18,148
Christ, my head is killing me.

920
00:54:18,232 --> 00:54:22,027
I drank a little, yes,
to celebrate the miraculous!

921
00:54:22,027 --> 00:54:23,195
Is that so terrible?

922
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,614
That I come here with great news,

923
00:54:25,697 --> 00:54:29,952
news that renders all this futile
in the grand scheme of things.

924
00:54:29,993 --> 00:54:33,205
I mean, I'm saying we don't only live once.

925
00:54:33,288 --> 00:54:35,415
We live over and over again.

926
00:54:36,208 --> 00:54:39,169
Cristal says I existed in Elizabethan England.

927
00:54:39,753 --> 00:54:43,507
All I'm saying is there's hope,
hope that maybe Roy will write another book,

928
00:54:43,549 --> 00:54:45,717
but in some future incarnation.

929
00:54:50,806 --> 00:54:52,975
I've got to get out of here!

930
00:54:55,602 --> 00:55:00,858
Oh, God. I can't do it anymore.
I can't be in this marriage.

931
00:55:00,983 --> 00:55:03,360
Let him go. Let him go. Let him go.

932
00:55:03,402 --> 00:55:05,404
You can do so much better.

933
00:55:05,696 --> 00:55:07,614
You know, Cristal says that
that man you work for,

934
00:55:07,614 --> 00:55:11,952
the one you're always so high on.
She says don't rule him out.

935
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,503
At that moment,
with his life going down the drain,

936
00:55:21,503 --> 00:55:23,881
Roy only wanted to see Dia.

937
00:55:26,717 --> 00:55:28,886
And, suddenly, there she was.

938
00:55:42,941 --> 00:55:46,236
But even if she wasn't getting married,
what the hell chance did he have?

939
00:55:46,612 --> 00:55:49,114
What could he offer her? What was he?

940
00:55:49,198 --> 00:55:53,660
A washed-up writer at 38?
A member of the "formerly promising" club?

941
00:55:54,203 --> 00:55:58,373
"Royal Channing." A hell of a name
for a limo driver or a bike messenger.

942
00:55:58,749 --> 00:56:01,835
The thought of beginning a new book
paralyzed him.

943
00:56:01,877 --> 00:56:03,712
He'd lost all his nerve.

944
00:56:04,129 --> 00:56:07,591
And what was he supposed to do,
work days and write nights?

945
00:56:07,716 --> 00:56:10,385
Not that he had an idea for another book.

946
00:56:10,552 --> 00:56:14,640
And just when you think
things can't possibly get any worse,

947
00:56:14,765 --> 00:56:18,185
fate lets you know
there's bigger trouble out there.

948
00:56:23,732 --> 00:56:24,817
Hello.

949
00:56:25,317 --> 00:56:26,985
I just thought you should know.

950
00:56:27,027 --> 00:56:30,197
Jeez, I'm in a state of shock here.
I can hardly speak.

951
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:33,408
There was a car accident,
a terrible car accident.

952
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:36,870
Mike Prince, Henry,
driving to the poker game.

953
00:56:36,954 --> 00:56:39,665
Head-on collision with another car.
Two girls dead. Henry's dead.

954
00:56:39,748 --> 00:56:41,083
Mike's in a coma.

955
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:43,502
Even a pedestrian on the pavement
is on the critical list.

956
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:45,003
It's just unbelievable.

957
00:56:45,087 --> 00:56:48,674
Two teenage drunks nicked the car...
Bam! Unbelievable.

958
00:56:52,761 --> 00:56:55,180
He couldn't get his mind around it.

959
00:56:55,514 --> 00:56:58,976
Mike Prince in a coma? A vegetable?

960
00:56:59,017 --> 00:57:01,061
Henry Strangler gone.

961
00:57:01,854 --> 00:57:03,230
He wasn't even that close with them,

962
00:57:03,313 --> 00:57:07,359
but it made him feel
how quick and fragile is existence.

963
00:57:10,487 --> 00:57:13,198
And that's when he had his crazy thought.

964
00:57:23,083 --> 00:57:25,002
Strangler lived alone.

965
00:57:25,085 --> 00:57:28,130
He had no family,
no time for a woman in his life,

966
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:31,383
and was obsessively private
about his first novel.

967
00:57:31,383 --> 00:57:35,846
Roy was the only one he'd trusted to read it,
this Roy knew for sure.

968
00:57:36,972 --> 00:57:41,018
Strangler had just finished tweaking it
and had not shown it to Malcolm Dodds yet

969
00:57:41,143 --> 00:57:43,437
because Roy was to arrange that.

970
00:57:43,437 --> 00:57:45,022
Strangler had no agent

971
00:57:45,314 --> 00:57:47,024
and none of the other poker players
were writers,

972
00:57:47,191 --> 00:57:51,028
and so had no particular interest in
or knowledge of his progress.

973
00:57:52,196 --> 00:57:56,116
The man was a drone,
a perfectionist, a workaholic.

974
00:57:56,950 --> 00:58:00,662
Possibly a genius
who'd written a terrific first book,

975
00:58:01,163 --> 00:58:03,916
but tragically and most conveniently,

976
00:58:05,083 --> 00:58:06,418
he was dead.

977
00:58:32,903 --> 00:58:34,196
I'm not familiar with your shop,

978
00:58:34,279 --> 00:58:36,782
but I'll make it my business
to tell Cristal all about it.

979
00:58:36,907 --> 00:58:41,370
Well, it's only small, but I think we carry
most of the important occult books.

980
00:58:41,537 --> 00:58:44,665
-Do you have any literature on reincarnation?
-Yes.

981
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:48,335
You know, sometimes I get a clear flash
that I've visited a place before.

982
00:58:48,418 --> 00:58:49,878
Perhaps ancient Egypt.

983
00:58:50,128 --> 00:58:51,922
My son-in-law pooh-poohs it,

984
00:58:52,172 --> 00:58:54,967
but if I didn't think there was more to life,
I couldn't go on.

985
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:58,595
You'd have got on well
with my dear, departed Claire.

986
00:58:59,847 --> 00:59:03,934
I've tried unsuccessfully to contact her
so far, but I won't give up.

987
00:59:04,351 --> 00:59:06,979
You obviously cared for her very deeply.

988
00:59:07,604 --> 00:59:10,232
Yes, it's been very lonely without her.

989
00:59:11,817 --> 00:59:14,987
It's got quite a bit of a kick to it.
It's got some chili oil in it.

990
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:18,782
Hey, come on, get dressed.
We're meeting the Hoveys in 45 minutes.

991
00:59:20,284 --> 00:59:21,827
What are you doing?

992
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:23,912
Come on. Get dressed.
We're meeting the Hoveys.

993
00:59:24,538 --> 00:59:27,082
I don't feel like seeing
one of them boring plays again.

994
00:59:27,082 --> 00:59:28,876
Well, this'll be great. Come on.

995
00:59:29,001 --> 00:59:32,713
That's what you said about the one Friday
and it was so boring.

996
00:59:33,172 --> 00:59:36,049
It was! Weren't even scary.

997
00:59:36,175 --> 00:59:38,427
Well, the ghosts were meant to be symbolic.

998
00:59:38,552 --> 00:59:41,346
It wasn't intended to be a scary play,
you know?

999
00:59:43,223 --> 00:59:47,686
Come on, look, it's not that I don't like
being at home with you, believe me.

1000
00:59:47,978 --> 00:59:51,315
It's too quiet in this house.
It's like a freaking echo.

1001
00:59:51,815 --> 00:59:54,526
You never like watching any of the telly I like.

1002
00:59:54,610 --> 00:59:57,488
Okay, well, I don't know.
What the hell are we talking about here?

1003
00:59:58,906 --> 01:00:04,036
What?

1004
01:00:05,078 --> 01:00:07,998
I'd like to do more things I like
once in a while.

1005
01:00:08,081 --> 01:00:10,542
Okay, all right. The rest of the week,
we'll do what you want.

1006
01:00:10,542 --> 01:00:12,252
Is that okay? Okay?

1007
01:00:12,961 --> 01:00:16,882
Come to the show tonight, and we'll do...
You call the shots the rest of the week.

1008
01:00:16,965 --> 01:00:18,550
How about that?

1009
01:00:23,138 --> 01:00:25,015
This is banging, isn't it?

1010
01:00:25,516 --> 01:00:27,017
I love this tune.

1011
01:00:37,069 --> 01:00:39,321
-Alfie, can I have a dance with him?
-What?

1012
01:00:39,488 --> 01:00:41,907
Can I dance with him? It's boring just sitting.

1013
01:00:42,032 --> 01:00:43,033
Yes?

1014
01:00:43,116 --> 01:00:46,286
-Okay. Don't stay out there too long.
-I won't.

1015
01:01:13,147 --> 01:01:16,191
Sally announced to Roy
she was starting her own gallery

1016
01:01:16,191 --> 01:01:18,318
and the time had come for a divorce.

1017
01:01:18,485 --> 01:01:23,323
By now, Dia had strong romantic ideas
about sharing her life with a writer.

1018
01:01:23,866 --> 01:01:26,952
-Your book is really riveting.
-Thank you.

1019
01:01:27,077 --> 01:01:31,206
You obviously must have spent
a lot of time in Ireland and Scotland.

1020
01:01:32,583 --> 01:01:36,086
Some. I did a lot of research.
A lot of research.

1021
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:39,256
I thought you told me
you've never been to Ireland.

1022
01:01:39,882 --> 01:01:43,051
Northern Ireland.
But I've been to other places.

1023
01:01:43,135 --> 01:01:45,846
I've been to Connemara.
That's one of the places I've been.

1024
01:01:46,096 --> 01:01:49,433
I loved so much the style of your writing,
you know?

1025
01:01:49,433 --> 01:01:51,894
Each word clicks along the page,

1026
01:01:52,019 --> 01:01:57,858
and your characters are so rich
and almost startling.

1027
01:01:57,983 --> 01:02:00,736
Wow. Thank you.
That's a huge compliment, coming from you.

1028
01:02:00,777 --> 01:02:01,904
-Thank you so much.
-No, no. It's all right.

1029
01:02:01,904 --> 01:02:04,072
It is. He hardly likes anything, believe me.

1030
01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:05,741
How's Alan, sweetheart?

1031
01:02:05,908 --> 01:02:08,285
-He's good, Mom.
-Is he coming this weekend?

1032
01:02:08,952 --> 01:02:10,704
Your father is very encouraging.

1033
01:02:10,746 --> 01:02:12,581
And he's a lovely guy.

1034
01:02:12,581 --> 01:02:14,750
Well, he's not that lovely
when he doesn't like something.

1035
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:16,001
No?

1036
01:02:16,043 --> 01:02:19,046
He's written a lot of criticism
for small literary magazines

1037
01:02:19,171 --> 01:02:21,256
and nothing much impresses him.

1038
01:02:22,549 --> 01:02:25,636
Well, what can I say? You're my muse.

1039
01:02:25,636 --> 01:02:28,430
You popped into my life
just when I needed divine inspiration.

1040
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:29,848
It's amazing.

1041
01:02:29,973 --> 01:02:33,060
-Well, that's what a muse does, right?
-I guess so.

1042
01:02:35,354 --> 01:02:37,648
-I love it here.
-It's lovely weather.

1043
01:02:47,074 --> 01:02:48,951
I don't even want to think what I'm thinking.

1044
01:02:49,076 --> 01:02:51,078
I can think of nothing else.

1045
01:02:52,621 --> 01:02:54,498
What am I going to do?

1046
01:02:55,707 --> 01:02:57,376
What I want you to do?

1047
01:02:58,252 --> 01:03:01,839
I want you as my forever muse.

1048
01:03:02,381 --> 01:03:06,552
Here, or in Paris. I write,
we open wine bottles, we make love.

1049
01:03:07,052 --> 01:03:11,849
They're all en route for the wedding.
Alan's family, his relatives and our friends.

1050
01:03:13,058 --> 01:03:15,352
Alan's going to be devastated.

1051
01:03:22,234 --> 01:03:23,485
That's okay.

1052
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:25,737
It's so wrong.

1053
01:03:28,615 --> 01:03:31,118
Look, I've told you before
not to make any large purchase

1054
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:32,828
without consulting me first.

1055
01:03:33,412 --> 01:03:34,746
But you said I could have them both.

1056
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:37,624
That was a while ago.
The picture's changed now.

1057
01:03:37,708 --> 01:03:39,084
Did you go bust or something?

1058
01:03:39,209 --> 01:03:43,630
God, I've tried to explain to you,
at this point in time, cash is tight.

1059
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:47,551
I lost a lot in the stock market
and Helena won't budge on the alimony.

1060
01:03:47,634 --> 01:03:51,013
We have to be more budget conscious,
that's all I'm saying.

1061
01:03:52,806 --> 01:03:54,183
Hey, come here.

1062
01:03:55,517 --> 01:03:58,353
You know how much I like to pamper you
and get you nice things.

1063
01:03:58,353 --> 01:04:02,274
But just ask me
before you spend this kind of money,

1064
01:04:02,316 --> 01:04:05,152
until I catch up on some expenditure, okay?

1065
01:04:06,111 --> 01:04:08,739
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah, I am, too, if I yelled.

1066
01:04:10,657 --> 01:04:15,412
Your face is all red.
You've got to watch your blood pressure.

1067
01:04:15,579 --> 01:04:16,914
Remember what the doctor said.

1068
01:04:16,955 --> 01:04:20,667
He says I've got
the arteries of a man half my age.

1069
01:04:20,792 --> 01:04:24,213
You know, I just have to get
to the gym more often to exercise.

1070
01:04:24,213 --> 01:04:29,885
I'm just working so hard. Yeah.
Hey, coat looks beautiful.

1071
01:04:30,052 --> 01:04:31,345
Fantastic.

1072
01:04:32,846 --> 01:04:36,141
The truth was that business reverses
and Alfie's extravagance

1073
01:04:36,183 --> 01:04:38,685
had led him into serious financial trouble.

1074
01:04:38,769 --> 01:04:43,315
And while he tried to keep up appearances,
he had become over his head in debt.

1075
01:04:58,413 --> 01:05:00,165
Your back any better?

1076
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:01,917
What?

1077
01:05:02,376 --> 01:05:03,961
I said, your back any better?

1078
01:05:04,044 --> 01:05:06,213
Yeah. I've done my leg in now.

1079
01:05:07,631 --> 01:05:10,050
I think I overdid the pedaling
when you weren't around.

1080
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:13,053
Well, I should come around more often.
Let me have a look.

1081
01:05:13,136 --> 01:05:15,264
You probably sprained it or something.

1082
01:05:15,305 --> 01:05:16,515
Come on.

1083
01:05:23,313 --> 01:05:25,065
You do have the touch.

1084
01:05:25,399 --> 01:05:27,734
I should be paying you,
not the other way around.

1085
01:05:28,902 --> 01:05:30,612
I'm very expensive.

1086
01:05:33,365 --> 01:05:37,119
You know, there's a rumor
that before you married Alfie Shepridge

1087
01:05:37,369 --> 01:05:39,204
that you worked in Las Vegas.

1088
01:05:39,371 --> 01:05:40,873
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

1089
01:05:41,123 --> 01:05:43,041
Were you in a show there?

1090
01:05:43,125 --> 01:05:45,419
Someone said a cocktail waitress.

1091
01:05:46,044 --> 01:05:48,380
But I reckon you were a model.

1092
01:05:50,465 --> 01:05:55,888
Whatever it was I did,
you can bet I was pretty good.

1093
01:05:57,181 --> 01:05:59,349
You must have enjoyed your work.

1094
01:05:59,516 --> 01:06:01,101
Well, why wouldn't I?

1095
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:04,480
On the other hand, if you liked it so much,

1096
01:06:05,731 --> 01:06:09,651
maybe you wouldn't have retired
and married Alfie Shepridge.

1097
01:06:10,944 --> 01:06:14,031
Well, if I said with some,
it wasn't always great.

1098
01:06:15,616 --> 01:06:19,244
But with most of the men I met,
it was very stimulating.

1099
01:06:21,163 --> 01:06:24,041
In what way was it stimulating?

1100
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,919
I learned a lot of things.

1101
01:06:28,837 --> 01:06:32,132
I met some very handsome actors
who liked to party.

1102
01:06:32,216 --> 01:06:35,469
Some footballers who were pretty athletic.

1103
01:06:35,802 --> 01:06:37,471
What'd they teach you?

1104
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:40,516
Let's say we taught each other.

1105
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:44,812
You want to teach me?

1106
01:06:50,818 --> 01:06:51,985
Not here.

1107
01:06:54,905 --> 01:06:56,156
I'm not yelling!

1108
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,575
Christ, can you blame me for being upset?

1109
01:06:58,575 --> 01:07:01,078
Of course he's upset.
Do you know what you're doing?

1110
01:07:01,286 --> 01:07:03,413
Can you all control yourselves, please?

1111
01:07:03,539 --> 01:07:07,042
We've got 1 23 people to notify.
Some of them have already flown in.

1112
01:07:07,084 --> 01:07:10,170
They're coming from Europe,
from Spain and Lugano.

1113
01:07:10,254 --> 01:07:13,048
Yes, I know that. I know that.

1114
01:07:13,048 --> 01:07:15,217
-Have you met someone else?
-What about the caterers, the band?

1115
01:07:15,259 --> 01:07:17,094
-This is not the time to discuss...
-Have you met someone else?

1116
01:07:17,219 --> 01:07:19,096
The band is getting on a plane
right now from India!

1117
01:07:19,096 --> 01:07:21,265
-Do you know how much this is gonna cost?
-Yes.

1118
01:07:21,431 --> 01:07:22,474
-She's met somebody else?
-Yes, I did.

1119
01:07:22,641 --> 01:07:25,519
-What?
-Who is he? Where did you meet him?

1120
01:07:25,686 --> 01:07:26,687
I don't want to talk about it!

1121
01:07:26,687 --> 01:07:29,148
Tarak, please! She's met someone else!

1122
01:07:29,189 --> 01:07:31,024
-She's met someone else?
-She's met someone else.

1123
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:33,569
-When?
-I can't believe this is happening.

1124
01:07:33,569 --> 01:07:35,571
-Stupid. She's stupid.
-I cannot believe it.

1125
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:38,365
Well, I guess if you can
fall in love so quickly,

1126
01:07:38,448 --> 01:07:40,868
-it's probably good we found out now.
-It's not that I don't care about you.

1127
01:07:41,034 --> 01:07:42,452
-Don't give me that!
-I'm really sorry. I feel awful.

1128
01:07:42,578 --> 01:07:44,371
-I didn't plan this.
-We had so many plans.

1129
01:07:44,413 --> 01:07:47,708
-I hate you. I hate you!
-Becky, that's enough.

1130
01:07:47,791 --> 01:07:50,419
Excuse me, don't you shout at my daughter.
That's my job.

1131
01:07:50,419 --> 01:07:51,712
Excuse me?

1132
01:07:51,879 --> 01:07:54,256
-How could she do this to my brother?
-Becky, Becky, calm down.

1133
01:07:54,339 --> 01:07:56,675
Can we all just calm down?

1134
01:07:56,717 --> 01:07:58,552
It's so disrespectful!

1135
01:07:58,677 --> 01:07:59,720
Calm down!

1136
01:08:06,018 --> 01:08:07,811
There you are, darling.

1137
01:08:08,604 --> 01:08:11,982
Do you recognize this?
We've passed here a million times.

1138
01:08:12,483 --> 01:08:14,776
I haven't seen you so perky in ages, Mum.

1139
01:08:14,902 --> 01:08:17,779
He's a very spiritual man.
We have a lot to talk about.

1140
01:08:17,779 --> 01:08:21,241
Cristal says it has positive future potential.
Come on.

1141
01:08:23,827 --> 01:08:26,705
There's a nice old pub on the corner.
Let me go and close up.

1142
01:08:26,788 --> 01:08:27,789
Good.

1143
01:08:27,831 --> 01:08:31,460
Has your mother told you
I've grown very fond of her?

1144
01:08:38,342 --> 01:08:40,719
Isn't he the most interesting man?

1145
01:08:41,512 --> 01:08:43,889
I'm just so glad you found somebody.

1146
01:08:43,889 --> 01:08:48,143
Well, he may not be a tall, dark stranger,
but he's become my stranger.

1147
01:08:48,393 --> 01:08:51,980
Mum, you always said that if I needed
a loan to start my own business,

1148
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:53,148
I could count on you.

1149
01:08:53,982 --> 01:08:56,693
And, well, there's nowhere else I can go.

1150
01:08:56,819 --> 01:08:58,654
To open your own gallery? Of course.

1151
01:08:58,779 --> 01:09:00,447
Cristal said you've got
a new future ahead of you,

1152
01:09:00,781 --> 01:09:02,449
now you're rid of that albatross.

1153
01:09:02,533 --> 01:09:05,452
Yes. I want to start over.

1154
01:09:06,787 --> 01:09:09,248
What about that exciting man you work for?

1155
01:09:09,289 --> 01:09:11,792
I know, you said he was married,

1156
01:09:11,917 --> 01:09:14,545
but I seem to recall
you did say there were problems.

1157
01:09:14,586 --> 01:09:18,757
Well, I wish I could say that
I left Roy for Greg, but no such luck.

1158
01:09:18,882 --> 01:09:21,718
Don't be defeatist.
I knew you were wild about him.

1159
01:09:21,718 --> 01:09:23,720
I asked Cristal about it.

1160
01:09:24,346 --> 01:09:26,682
She said she got the distinct impression

1161
01:09:26,807 --> 01:09:28,934
that you ought to make
your feelings known to him.

1162
01:09:29,017 --> 01:09:32,187
Well, I think he knew. I think.

1163
01:09:35,357 --> 01:09:39,862
You know, Sally, I'm very sorry
to hear you'll be leaving.

1164
01:09:39,987 --> 01:09:42,614
But at the same time,

1165
01:09:44,491 --> 01:09:46,785
you know, I wish you only the best.

1166
01:09:47,494 --> 01:09:50,581
Because you actually deserve it.

1167
01:09:51,790 --> 01:09:55,252
I really appreciate all the experience here.

1168
01:09:56,128 --> 01:09:59,548
You know, of all of my assistants,

1169
01:10:00,174 --> 01:10:03,260
I enjoyed working with you
the most, actually.

1170
01:10:05,512 --> 01:10:06,722
In truth,

1171
01:10:08,015 --> 01:10:11,643
I think I was beginning to grow

1172
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:14,980
maybe a little too fond
of the time we spent together.

1173
01:10:16,356 --> 01:10:20,068
Well, we had very much
the same artistic tastes.

1174
01:10:20,402 --> 01:10:23,614
And I'm sure that had become very obvious.

1175
01:10:23,947 --> 01:10:25,157
What had?

1176
01:10:26,617 --> 01:10:30,913
That I was starting to feel
a little too close to you.

1177
01:10:31,121 --> 01:10:32,789
Not at all.

1178
01:10:32,998 --> 01:10:35,709
You certainly did a great job. You did.

1179
01:10:37,753 --> 01:10:39,129
Actually...

1180
01:10:41,048 --> 01:10:44,551
How can I say this? It's not just the gallery.

1181
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:48,347
My life is kind of in flux right now.

1182
01:10:49,598 --> 01:10:51,809
Roy and I are getting a divorce.

1183
01:10:52,351 --> 01:10:54,186
I'm sorry to hear that.

1184
01:10:55,354 --> 01:11:00,150
I remember you saying
that you were having problems at home, too.

1185
01:11:01,026 --> 01:11:06,156
Well, I shouldn't say anything about this,
but Carol and I are splitting up,

1186
01:11:07,366 --> 01:11:12,538
and I've started seeing your protege.

1187
01:11:13,455 --> 01:11:14,706
Iris.

1188
01:11:20,712 --> 01:11:25,801
Maybe I should have told you things
weren't going so well with my husband

1189
01:11:25,884 --> 01:11:29,513
and I was ripe for an affair.

1190
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:31,306
Maybe, who knows?

1191
01:11:31,348 --> 01:11:35,811
Maybe we could have wound up dating
before you met Iris.

1192
01:11:35,853 --> 01:11:37,229
What can I say?

1193
01:11:37,354 --> 01:11:40,357
You know I only wish you the best
on your new project.

1194
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:45,445
But I suppose you could never
have seen yourself returning my feelings.

1195
01:11:45,821 --> 01:11:48,991
You often said your fondest dream
was to open your own gallery,

1196
01:11:49,158 --> 01:11:50,409
so now you have it.

1197
01:11:50,409 --> 01:11:51,702
Could you?

1198
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:52,953
What?

1199
01:11:55,247 --> 01:11:56,748
See yourself?

1200
01:11:58,333 --> 01:11:59,376
What?

1201
01:12:01,253 --> 01:12:03,046
Have seen us together?

1202
01:12:04,715 --> 01:12:11,180
We were coworkers, friends, certainly.
Colleagues.

1203
01:12:13,015 --> 01:12:15,017
And now we are competitors.

1204
01:12:15,184 --> 01:12:19,021
You see how ironic and beautiful life is?

1205
01:12:40,751 --> 01:12:42,294
Driver, pull over.

1206
01:13:00,562 --> 01:13:03,732
Ray? What are you doing here?
You're out of your way, aren't you?

1207
01:13:03,816 --> 01:13:05,692
-Yeah...
-Did you see my wife?

1208
01:13:05,818 --> 01:13:07,236
She came out of the hotel just now.

1209
01:13:07,361 --> 01:13:09,780
Mrs. Shepridge? No, I didn't, to be honest.

1210
01:13:09,822 --> 01:13:12,991
I just passed in the taxi
and I just saw her coming out of the hotel.

1211
01:13:12,991 --> 01:13:14,326
Honestly, I didn't see her. No.

1212
01:13:14,493 --> 01:13:17,371
-What are you doing over here anyway?
-I live just down there.

1213
01:13:17,538 --> 01:13:20,082
But, I'll see you soon.

1214
01:13:20,082 --> 01:13:21,750
Yeah. You didn't?

1215
01:13:27,297 --> 01:13:32,177
So, what were you doing
at the Hotel Lucerne today?

1216
01:13:33,512 --> 01:13:36,765
I said, what were you doing
at the Hotel Lucerne today?

1217
01:13:37,474 --> 01:13:39,268
I wasn't at the Hotel Lucerne.

1218
01:13:39,768 --> 01:13:41,520
I thought I saw you.

1219
01:13:42,312 --> 01:13:45,315
Well, you must have been mistaken.

1220
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:56,076
So, where were you at noon today?

1221
01:13:57,452 --> 01:13:58,871
I was in the gym.

1222
01:14:01,081 --> 01:14:04,001
And if you don't believe me,
you can ask Ray Richards.

1223
01:14:04,084 --> 01:14:06,587
He was showing me
one of those new machines they got.

1224
01:14:11,592 --> 01:14:14,219
The day came when Roy moved out.

1225
01:14:14,219 --> 01:14:16,847
And for the time being,
where else could he move,

1226
01:14:16,972 --> 01:14:18,474
but in with Dia?

1227
01:14:48,128 --> 01:14:52,591
I mean, we don't just want it.
We are absolutely ecstatic.

1228
01:14:52,591 --> 01:14:56,178
Everybody, literally everybody who's read it
has been knocked out.

1229
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:59,056
Bill Cousin said to me,
"I can't believe the same man

1230
01:14:59,264 --> 01:15:00,974
"who wrote his last two books
wrote this one."

1231
01:15:01,016 --> 01:15:03,393
Nothing you've done could prepare us for it.

1232
01:15:03,519 --> 01:15:06,688
Anyway, my theory is this.
This is the real you,

1233
01:15:06,772 --> 01:15:07,981
and what you were doing before

1234
01:15:08,148 --> 01:15:10,609
was you were forcing your books
to accommodate your intellectual ideas.

1235
01:15:10,609 --> 01:15:11,819
No, thank you.

1236
01:15:11,819 --> 01:15:16,114
Anyway, we all believe that
this makes you emerge as a major talent.

1237
01:15:18,283 --> 01:15:19,159
Do you remember this place?

1238
01:15:19,284 --> 01:15:22,746
We ate our dinner here
the first night we went out.

1239
01:15:22,746 --> 01:15:24,414
Do you remember? We sat over there.

1240
01:15:24,456 --> 01:15:25,666
-Remember that?
-I do, indeed.

1241
01:15:25,791 --> 01:15:26,750
They knocked that wall down.

1242
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:28,794
You were so insecure.
Do you remember that?

1243
01:15:28,877 --> 01:15:29,962
Yeah, I wanted to impress you.

1244
01:15:30,087 --> 01:15:32,840
I remember the date,
it was 9th of January, 1 970.

1245
01:15:32,965 --> 01:15:34,842
It was a Friday. I forget nothing.

1246
01:15:34,967 --> 01:15:37,678
No, you don't. Of course, you loved me then.

1247
01:15:38,262 --> 01:15:41,140
Oh, don't say "then" just like that. "Then."

1248
01:15:41,348 --> 01:15:44,434
You make it sound like another lifetime.
Thank you.

1249
01:15:46,603 --> 01:15:48,689
I mean, we've been through
so much together.

1250
01:15:48,814 --> 01:15:52,818
Sally's various growing pains,
and the loss of Paul.

1251
01:15:52,901 --> 01:15:54,903
Let's not talk about it.

1252
01:15:54,903 --> 01:15:57,781
Well, we got each other through it,
didn't we?

1253
01:15:59,283 --> 01:16:00,659
Not quite.

1254
01:16:05,998 --> 01:16:10,961
Helena, is there any chance
that we could begin again?

1255
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:13,839
What?

1256
01:16:15,424 --> 01:16:17,885
I made a terrible mistake.

1257
01:16:20,179 --> 01:16:23,765
My life is so messed up.
I can't tell you how messed up it is.

1258
01:16:23,849 --> 01:16:26,602
But, Alfie, you're recently married.

1259
01:16:27,102 --> 01:16:30,606
I know. I blundered. I made a stupid mistake.
I screwed up.

1260
01:16:32,399 --> 01:16:35,527
I'm so fucking scared of being alone.
Excuse me, but...

1261
01:16:36,153 --> 01:16:40,532
And then I saw my life slipping away,
and I panicked.

1262
01:16:41,283 --> 01:16:44,453
Alfie, you'll live again.

1263
01:16:46,079 --> 01:16:48,290
We don't just live one life.

1264
01:16:49,541 --> 01:16:53,170
The world is far more mysterious
than it appears to our eyes.

1265
01:16:53,504 --> 01:16:54,796
What are you talking about?

1266
01:16:55,214 --> 01:16:56,882
I've lived before.

1267
01:16:57,049 --> 01:17:00,552
Cristal pointed it out and it's clear to me,
and to Jonathan.

1268
01:17:01,178 --> 01:17:02,763
Who's Jonathan?

1269
01:17:05,432 --> 01:17:08,852
Jonathan is a gentleman
I've been keeping company with.

1270
01:17:10,187 --> 01:17:12,189
So you've met someone else, have you?

1271
01:17:13,148 --> 01:17:15,943
Yes. Someone who shares
my spiritual ideals.

1272
01:17:15,943 --> 01:17:17,694
For God's sake, come on.

1273
01:17:18,487 --> 01:17:20,322
All I'm saying is that...

1274
01:17:23,742 --> 01:17:26,787
I want you back. I need you.

1275
01:17:28,789 --> 01:17:31,166
I have a new life. I've moved on.

1276
01:17:32,167 --> 01:17:35,003
You have a new wife. You're married.

1277
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:39,800
And I'm sure she'll give you
the son you've always wanted.

1278
01:17:55,065 --> 01:17:56,692
What the hell is going on here?

1279
01:17:56,817 --> 01:17:59,486
-Nothing.
-Where are you going? Fuck off.

1280
01:17:59,486 --> 01:18:00,863
Alfie, Alfie!

1281
01:18:00,946 --> 01:18:03,115
Don't touch me! You want some?

1282
01:18:03,115 --> 01:18:05,200
He was just trying to... No!

1283
01:18:05,909 --> 01:18:07,494
Ray? Help!

1284
01:18:08,453 --> 01:18:09,538
Fuck!

1285
01:18:09,746 --> 01:18:20,591
If you can hear me, Claire Wunch,
make yourself known.

1286
01:18:24,761 --> 01:18:26,346
Is that you, Claire?

1287
01:18:27,848 --> 01:18:30,476
If the spirit is Claire, please signal,

1288
01:18:31,602 --> 01:18:34,605
one for yes, two for no.

1289
01:18:37,524 --> 01:18:40,652
Are you all right, Claire? Are you happy?

1290
01:18:45,407 --> 01:18:49,536
I still love you very much, Claire.
Do you care for me?

1291
01:18:51,747 --> 01:18:52,789
Ask her.

1292
01:18:53,582 --> 01:18:56,793
I will always care for you, my darling Claire.

1293
01:19:00,214 --> 01:19:02,382
-Ask her, Jonathan.
-Just wait.

1294
01:19:04,551 --> 01:19:08,222
Claire, I've always been faithful.

1295
01:19:09,014 --> 01:19:10,307
I love you.

1296
01:19:11,517 --> 01:19:12,935
Ask her about us.

1297
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:15,395
Yes. I don't want to upset her.

1298
01:19:16,271 --> 01:19:19,066
You said you needed her permission.
Ask her.

1299
01:19:21,026 --> 01:19:24,446
Claire, you know you've always been the one.

1300
01:19:27,449 --> 01:19:30,327
-I can't.
-Ask her, for Christ's sake!

1301
01:19:30,452 --> 01:19:33,205
Please. Please, this is difficult for me.

1302
01:19:34,414 --> 01:19:36,250
I still love the woman.

1303
01:19:37,459 --> 01:19:39,586
Helena! Please, Helena!

1304
01:19:41,171 --> 01:19:42,548
Boys, here she is.

1305
01:19:42,589 --> 01:19:45,759
Guys, meet Dia, my muse and future wife.

1306
01:19:45,843 --> 01:19:48,387
Hello, Dia. Where's he been hiding you?

1307
01:19:48,428 --> 01:19:50,597
Have you been
in the Witness Protection Program?

1308
01:19:50,681 --> 01:19:52,474
It's like you dropped off the world
or something.

1309
01:19:52,474 --> 01:19:53,684
Give me a break. Give me a break.

1310
01:19:53,725 --> 01:19:56,270
Look, my marriage broke up,
I've had to move out,

1311
01:19:56,353 --> 01:19:58,564
-my novel's being rushed into print.
-That's right.

1312
01:19:58,564 --> 01:20:02,901
And I've been exploring the erogenous zones
of this incredible creature.

1313
01:20:03,152 --> 01:20:05,696
I hear wonderful things about your book.
When do we read it?

1314
01:20:05,696 --> 01:20:07,072
There'll be freebies for everybody.

1315
01:20:07,114 --> 01:20:10,117
Who can blame me if I've been a little
overwhelmed by events of the last month?

1316
01:20:11,410 --> 01:20:12,786
I wanted to get to the funeral. I just couldn't.

1317
01:20:12,911 --> 01:20:17,416
That whole thing was so tragic.
I mean, it was just so awful.

1318
01:20:17,416 --> 01:20:18,667
How is Mike coming?

1319
01:20:18,792 --> 01:20:21,044
You know, people come out
of comas sometimes and they're okay.

1320
01:20:21,044 --> 01:20:22,421
It happens.

1321
01:20:22,546 --> 01:20:24,381
No, Mike's not in a coma.

1322
01:20:24,965 --> 01:20:26,550
-Don't tell me he died.
-Yeah, he did.

1323
01:20:26,633 --> 01:20:28,635
Oh, God.

1324
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:31,263
Or was it for the best
if he was going to be a vegetable?

1325
01:20:31,346 --> 01:20:34,683
No, Mike was never in a coma.
He died straightaway.

1326
01:20:34,725 --> 01:20:36,518
Strangler's in the coma.

1327
01:20:38,353 --> 01:20:40,147
What are you talking about?

1328
01:20:40,314 --> 01:20:41,815
Mike died instantly.

1329
01:20:41,857 --> 01:20:44,401
Strangler's the one who's in the coma.

1330
01:20:44,485 --> 01:20:48,405
No. I thought you told me that Strangler died.

1331
01:20:48,614 --> 01:20:50,449
No, no, no. No!

1332
01:20:50,574 --> 01:20:54,161
Either you misunderstood,
or, you know, I was so hysterical.

1333
01:20:54,828 --> 01:20:57,873
Well, you know they pulled the bodies out.
Maybe I said Strangler.

1334
01:20:57,956 --> 01:20:59,082
Maybe I did.

1335
01:20:59,208 --> 01:21:05,214
But, no, first... I mean, in fact
they thought at first that it was Strangler.

1336
01:21:05,214 --> 01:21:06,757
But that's the confusion.

1337
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:11,136
That's the confusion
because we thought, yes, but no.

1338
01:21:11,261 --> 01:21:14,097
Strangler is in a coma,

1339
01:21:14,264 --> 01:21:16,517
but they think that there's a good chance
that he could come out of it.

1340
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,769
Yes. He had an awful trauma,

1341
01:21:18,894 --> 01:21:21,146
and the truth is at first
they thought it was hopeless,

1342
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:23,524
but now, touch wood, it's 50-50.

1343
01:21:23,607 --> 01:21:28,278
Yeah. I mean, of course, how he turns out
if he does come out of it is anybody's guess.

1344
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,446
I mean, he could be a cabbage.

1345
01:21:29,613 --> 01:21:32,157
No, they say there's a good chance
he could be okay.

1346
01:21:32,241 --> 01:21:35,911
It depends. It's a mysterious area.
They can't really predict.

1347
01:21:36,245 --> 01:21:40,749
Hey! They just had on television
three people in comas after long periods.

1348
01:21:40,791 --> 01:21:45,379
They all came out of it. They were all fine.
One of them went back to being a teacher.

1349
01:21:47,089 --> 01:21:51,677
Strangler's trauma wasn't as terrible
as everyone thought to begin with.

1350
01:21:51,718 --> 01:21:54,721
In fact, it could go either way. Are you okay?

1351
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:57,766
What's happening, Roy?
You've just suddenly turned white.

1352
01:21:57,891 --> 01:21:59,852
-Are you okay?
-I need something to drink.

1353
01:21:59,893 --> 01:22:04,148
Listen, Roy, the doctors encourage people
to visit him and talk to him.

1354
01:22:04,314 --> 01:22:05,816
They think that maybe he can hear.

1355
01:22:05,858 --> 01:22:07,401
So, we're going to go down later this week.

1356
01:22:07,484 --> 01:22:09,486
Why don't you come along?
Because he was very fond of you. Yeah?

1357
01:22:09,528 --> 01:22:11,613
-Okay, yeah.
-Okay. We'll go.

1358
01:22:12,364 --> 01:22:14,199
I've got to see a doctor!
I think I've put my back out!

1359
01:22:14,283 --> 01:22:15,826
I've broken a rib. Jesus!

1360
01:22:17,077 --> 01:22:18,662
I've broken a rib.

1361
01:22:19,288 --> 01:22:21,582
Alfie, can we just leave it now?

1362
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,959
-Let's move on. Yeah?
-No.

1363
01:22:24,168 --> 01:22:26,628
Nothing happened! I mean...

1364
01:22:27,629 --> 01:22:30,466
I mean, I know it looked bad,

1365
01:22:30,507 --> 01:22:34,344
and your face hurts and all,
but can you just stop being angry?

1366
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:37,139
I am angry! Jesus Christ.

1367
01:22:37,681 --> 01:22:38,724
Don't be angry,

1368
01:22:38,932 --> 01:22:42,269
'cause I've got something to tell you
that's gonna make you so happy.

1369
01:22:44,104 --> 01:22:45,272
Alfie?

1370
01:22:45,272 --> 01:22:51,153
-What?
-I'm pregnant.

1371
01:22:52,154 --> 01:22:53,697
-A child?
-Yeah.

1372
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:55,824
-You're going to have a child?
-Yes.

1373
01:22:55,991 --> 01:22:57,367
A baby.

1374
01:22:59,077 --> 01:23:06,835
How can I be sure it's mine?

1375
01:23:08,837 --> 01:23:12,716
'Cause I've been telling you!

1376
01:23:12,883 --> 01:23:16,136
Alfie, I've been telling you!
He forced himself on me!

1377
01:23:16,887 --> 01:23:18,263
I couldn't get away!

1378
01:23:18,347 --> 01:23:21,433
He said he was gonna teach me
some stretching exercises.

1379
01:23:21,475 --> 01:23:25,729
I can't move 'cause I'm so scared,
I'm in shock.

1380
01:23:25,896 --> 01:23:29,733
I can't move my body,
and he's kissing me so much, I can't scream.

1381
01:23:34,947 --> 01:23:36,990
You should be over the moon.

1382
01:23:39,576 --> 01:23:41,245
It's what you wanted.

1383
01:23:42,913 --> 01:23:47,251
How long have you been sleeping with him?
And who else? How many others?

1384
01:23:49,044 --> 01:23:50,879
What do you think I am?

1385
01:23:51,296 --> 01:23:55,134
There are tests. There are DNA tests.
I'll have the baby tested.

1386
01:23:55,717 --> 01:23:57,970
I am not having my baby tested.

1387
01:23:58,512 --> 01:24:00,139
It's yours!

1388
01:24:00,681 --> 01:24:02,432
I'll believe that when I have it tested.

1389
01:24:02,474 --> 01:24:05,602
Please, don't make me angrier
than I am at you.

1390
01:24:06,478 --> 01:24:08,814
Those tests aren't even 1 00% right, so.

1391
01:24:08,897 --> 01:24:10,149
Yes, it is.

1392
01:24:10,983 --> 01:24:16,488
And for all our sakes,
I'd better be the father. Believe me.

1393
01:24:18,615 --> 01:24:20,576
What's the difference?

1394
01:24:22,244 --> 01:24:24,163
You always wanted a kid.

1395
01:24:24,913 --> 01:24:27,082
I want a son. I lost a son.

1396
01:24:27,833 --> 01:24:31,086
I lost a little boy. I want it to be my son.

1397
01:24:31,461 --> 01:24:32,880
You understand?

1398
01:24:37,092 --> 01:24:38,760
Who's going to know?

1399
01:24:39,344 --> 01:24:40,888
I'll know,

1400
01:24:40,888 --> 01:24:42,306
if it's a boy

1401
01:24:43,807 --> 01:24:46,310
and if I decide to have it tested.

1402
01:24:50,814 --> 01:24:51,982
Mum!

1403
01:24:54,985 --> 01:24:56,111
Hello?

1404
01:25:00,782 --> 01:25:03,785
What are you doing?
Didn't you hear me ringing?

1405
01:25:04,203 --> 01:25:09,166
I do believe that I existed in a prior life,
a happier life, Sally.

1406
01:25:09,249 --> 01:25:11,793
I get intimations of it all the time.

1407
01:25:11,793 --> 01:25:15,130
I was about to embark
on an adventure with a stranger.

1408
01:25:15,881 --> 01:25:20,135
I don't like it when you talk to yourself.
You spend too much time alone.

1409
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:22,137
What happened to Jonathan?

1410
01:25:22,846 --> 01:25:27,017
I've been all over it with Cristal.
He left me for another woman.

1411
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:28,519
No.

1412
01:25:28,602 --> 01:25:30,187
A deceased one.

1413
01:25:30,896 --> 01:25:34,566
They're often the stiffest competition.
No pun intended.

1414
01:25:36,151 --> 01:25:39,029
But Cristal says my future's looking good.

1415
01:25:40,155 --> 01:25:42,574
I had hoped things would work out.

1416
01:25:42,616 --> 01:25:45,828
I'm sorry. Is there anything I can do?

1417
01:25:46,578 --> 01:25:47,412
No.

1418
01:25:49,248 --> 01:25:53,252
Well, Mum, Cristal always seems to know
what's best for you.

1419
01:25:53,335 --> 01:25:56,213
And if she says the future looks good,
you can bet on it.

1420
01:25:56,296 --> 01:26:00,259
Another life.
I just have to shed the old one and try again.

1421
01:26:03,303 --> 01:26:08,392
Mum, I know I told you
about a substantial loan I'd need

1422
01:26:08,392 --> 01:26:10,018
to get the art gallery started up,

1423
01:26:10,018 --> 01:26:14,148
but, well, it turns out
it's a bit more than I anticipated.

1424
01:26:15,149 --> 01:26:16,358
Not a lot.

1425
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,652
And it'll all come back to you,

1426
01:26:18,986 --> 01:26:21,155
but maybe not for a year or two.

1427
01:26:22,614 --> 01:26:26,201
About the loan, darling,
the timing right now is wrong.

1428
01:26:26,243 --> 01:26:28,787
With interest, of course. What?

1429
01:26:29,621 --> 01:26:30,998
The aspects are not right.

1430
01:26:31,915 --> 01:26:33,709
What are you talking about? What aspects?

1431
01:26:33,709 --> 01:26:37,462
I spoke to Cristal, and she said I can't do it

1432
01:26:37,546 --> 01:26:40,299
because the stars
are not in the right alignment.

1433
01:26:41,049 --> 01:26:42,426
What?

1434
01:26:42,676 --> 01:26:45,345
Cristal said the planets tell her

1435
01:26:47,014 --> 01:26:51,810
I must not enter into any financial
transactions for the indefinite future.

1436
01:26:52,186 --> 01:26:54,563
And certainly the loan
comes under that heading.

1437
01:26:54,646 --> 01:26:57,024
Mother, she doesn't know
what she's talking about.

1438
01:26:57,232 --> 01:27:00,152
-Sally.
-Mother, I was counting on that money!

1439
01:27:00,194 --> 01:27:04,198
Someday, perhaps, but not with
the planets in their present conjunction.

1440
01:27:04,239 --> 01:27:06,992
Cristal doesn't know
what she's talking about!

1441
01:27:07,034 --> 01:27:09,953
-Please.
-She's a charlatan!

1442
01:27:10,287 --> 01:27:12,456
We're talking about Cristal Delgiorno.

1443
01:27:12,539 --> 01:27:14,666
I need that loan!

1444
01:27:14,666 --> 01:27:18,253
-Cristal said...
-I don't care what Cristal said!

1445
01:27:18,462 --> 01:27:19,880
I can't!

1446
01:27:20,047 --> 01:27:21,673
She's a fraud!

1447
01:27:23,383 --> 01:27:24,885
Do you hear what you're saying?

1448
01:27:25,010 --> 01:27:27,346
She's a fake fortune teller!

1449
01:27:27,513 --> 01:27:30,808
There's no such thing
as predicting the future!

1450
01:27:30,808 --> 01:27:32,309
Are you mad?

1451
01:27:32,351 --> 01:27:35,187
You've always been her greatest supporter.

1452
01:27:35,687 --> 01:27:38,482
I was only saying those things
just to keep you happy,

1453
01:27:38,649 --> 01:27:40,025
to keep you from harming yourself!

1454
01:27:40,150 --> 01:27:42,611
She's a blatant, conniving little fraud!

1455
01:27:42,653 --> 01:27:44,363
You sound like your ex.

1456
01:27:44,613 --> 01:27:49,409
Darling, I know you've been through
the most horrible breakup.

1457
01:27:49,993 --> 01:27:52,120
I have to have that money.

1458
01:27:52,204 --> 01:27:53,121
Not now.

1459
01:27:53,747 --> 01:27:55,290
Cristal says no.

1460
01:27:56,333 --> 01:27:59,586
You idiot! You poor, pathetic,
gullible imbecile!

1461
01:27:59,711 --> 01:28:02,548
Don't you see? She just tells you
what you want to hear,

1462
01:28:02,631 --> 01:28:04,508
and then robs you of your money!

1463
01:28:04,925 --> 01:28:07,344
Darling, if I give you the money now,

1464
01:28:07,386 --> 01:28:10,389
it would be bad luck, she said,
for you as well as me.

1465
01:28:10,556 --> 01:28:12,349
You crazy imbecile!

1466
01:28:12,558 --> 01:28:14,977
I need that loan, you lunatic!

1467
01:28:15,018 --> 01:28:17,271
I'm doing this for your own good.

1468
01:28:18,188 --> 01:28:20,607
Cristal has the power of prophecy.

1469
01:28:23,402 --> 01:28:25,821
Come on, Henry, wake up, mate.
We know you're faking it.

1470
01:28:25,904 --> 01:28:28,615
We really miss you at the poker game, Henry.

1471
01:28:29,408 --> 01:28:32,286
We found a really nice girl for you,
didn't we, lads?

1472
01:28:32,411 --> 01:28:35,873
She's right up your street,
she's got the overbite and everything.

1473
01:28:36,248 --> 01:28:38,250
Are you hearing us, Henry?

1474
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:40,711
I know you can hear us.

1475
01:28:41,253 --> 01:28:45,090
If you can understand us, wiggle your fingers

1476
01:28:46,258 --> 01:28:48,719
or make a fist.

1477
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:51,388
Blink. We'll take anything, right, Roy?

1478
01:28:52,014 --> 01:28:53,891
Listen, Roy's written a book.

1479
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:55,893
It's about a child pornographer in Belfast.

1480
01:28:56,018 --> 01:28:58,812
You want to get yourself well to read it.
It's got bestseller written all over it.

1481
01:28:58,854 --> 01:29:00,355
He's blinking.

1482
01:29:00,397 --> 01:29:02,524
Is he blinking? I can't tell.

1483
01:29:03,317 --> 01:29:05,819
Blink twice if you understand me, Henry.

1484
01:29:05,819 --> 01:29:08,822
The doctor said he was optimistic.
Talk to him, Roy.

1485
01:29:08,906 --> 01:29:11,992
Blink if you can hear us, Henry.
Can you hear us?

1486
01:29:14,119 --> 01:29:18,165
He's blinking. It's very faint.
Do it again! See?

1487
01:29:18,332 --> 01:29:20,751
-He understands. He definitely understands.
-There.

1488
01:29:20,834 --> 01:29:24,129
That head neurologist said it all had to do
with the portion of the brain affected.

1489
01:29:24,129 --> 01:29:26,256
He's convinced
Henry's going to come out of it.

1490
01:29:26,381 --> 01:29:27,591
That'd be marvelous.

1491
01:29:27,591 --> 01:29:29,009
Hey, if you've got the time,

1492
01:29:29,009 --> 01:29:30,552
you should come in
and read him your new book.

1493
01:29:30,552 --> 01:29:32,554
-Henry.
-I know he can understand.

1494
01:29:32,554 --> 01:29:35,224
-Henry!
-Do it again, Henry. Blink again!

1495
01:29:50,531 --> 01:29:53,867
I contacted Claire, put the question to her,

1496
01:29:53,909 --> 01:29:55,911
and she said there'd be no problem

1497
01:29:55,911 --> 01:29:58,372
if you were to become
the second Mrs. Wunch.

1498
01:29:58,539 --> 01:29:59,456
She said that?

1499
01:29:59,581 --> 01:30:03,710
She rapped twice for no when I asked
if she'd mind if I married you.

1500
01:30:03,752 --> 01:30:05,712
You always said
she was an understanding woman.

1501
01:30:05,796 --> 01:30:08,465
I'm not sure she didn't exist once as royalty.

1502
01:30:08,882 --> 01:30:11,760
It's so comforting to know
we live over and over again.

1503
01:30:11,802 --> 01:30:14,388
If only I could convince Alfie,
he'd be so much happier.

1504
01:30:14,513 --> 01:30:15,430
Yes.

1505
01:30:15,514 --> 01:30:19,768
It's time to close the book on our little tale
of sound and fury, signifying nothing.

1506
01:30:20,978 --> 01:30:25,983
And one has to wonder,
given all of life's uncertainty and pain,

1507
01:30:26,024 --> 01:30:27,985
how do we get through it?

1508
01:30:28,026 --> 01:30:30,612
Well, as Sally told Roy,

1509
01:30:30,737 --> 01:30:33,699
sometimes the illusions
work better than the medicine.

1510
01:30:33,866 --> 01:30:36,910
I was a peasant, just a simple peasant,

1511
01:30:36,952 --> 01:30:41,039
but you, you were something very special.

1512
01:30:41,748 --> 01:30:46,545
Sometimes my intuition makes me think
that you might have lived before

1513
01:30:46,587 --> 01:30:48,964
as Cleopatra or Joan of Arc.

1514
01:30:50,382 --> 01:30:53,385
Cristal Delgiorno's confirmed
that I lived before,

1515
01:30:53,385 --> 01:30:56,555
and I've always had a particular fondness
for everything French.

1516
01:30:56,555 --> 01:31:00,225
So, I'm inclined to think
you may be right about Joan of Arc.

1517
01:31:00,559 --> 01:31:02,644
Sometimes I have memories of my past lives.

1518
01:31:02,728 --> 01:31:04,104
Do you?

1519
01:31:04,188 --> 01:31:06,607
I do. Yes.

1520
01:31:06,648 --> 01:31:08,025
In France.

1521
01:31:09,305 --> 01:31:15,150
