You Wouldn't happen to have
a spare pole, Would you?

00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,251
We've got some poles in
the storage shed out back.

<i>(Laney)
You know, she's at the top of

00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,536
Well, if she can Write
half as good as she can cook,

What is it?

Have you ever

Actually, yes.

I Was in the press corps.

Have you ever been married?

<i>You know, look, this

but I lost my mother
When I Was your age.

283
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:27,710
It Was one of the hardest

No, but I'm here
to support Mia.

309
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:04,465
She has plenty of support.

310
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:08,233
I can see that.

311
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,338
Maxine, What
Was that all about?

312
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,881
I thought she
made all that up.

313
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:19,439
You thought
Who made What up?

314
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:23,454
Mia, noW's
not the time.

319
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,906
I got tangled up
With a deer.

320
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:45,306
Not that it's any
of your business.

321
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,867
You knoW, you're
a real piece of Work.

322
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:49,038
HoW could you leave her
in a lurch like that?

323
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:49,978
Excuse me?

324
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,481
You don't look like a guy
that couldn't afford a Wife.

325
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,574
What are you talking about?

326
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:55,012
You knoW What I'm talking about
and don't play innocent With me.

327
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:56,314
Sarah Was my best friend.

328
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,515
I never met Sarah!

329
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,922
What the heck's Wrong
With you people?

330
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:28,045

You don't Want to knoW.

333
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:32,250

He's the guy that left
Sarah pregnant and broke.

336
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:37,183
You're kidding.

337
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,024
No.

338
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,324

NoW look at Mia.

341

Lots of people look alike.

342
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:46,929
It could be, I guess.

343
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,235

Very good, Mia.

361
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,280
But What does it say
about plagiarism?

362
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,380
Don't do it.

363
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,584
All right, tWo for tWo.

364
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:16,451
<i>(male teacher)
Don't sweat it.</i>

365
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,964
Just get the extra credit done,
bring it back to me next Week,

366
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,589
and We'll get it going.

367
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,396
You'll be fine.

368
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:27,729
Hey, What's up Mia?

369
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:29,473
I got something
I Want to ask you.

370
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,202
I am listening.

371
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,141
HoW Would I go about
finding information on someone

372
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,610
in another state?

373
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:38,240
I'd start With
publicdata.com probably.

374
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:39,510
And What can I find there?

375
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:41,575
You could find out
Whether the person's got

376
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,712
a criminal record,
Whether they've been sued,

377
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:45,585
Whether they drive too fast.

378
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,217
Can I find out Whether
they've been married?

379
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,284
Not there, no.

380
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:52,625
But each state keeps
marriage license records,

381
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:56,133
so the county clerk's office
is Where you Want to check.

382
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,429
Thanks.

383
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:58,434
You bet.

384
00:28:58,503 --> 00:28:59,595
See you next Week.

385
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,468
Take care.

386
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:05,375
<i>(Mia)
Hi, my name
is Mia Williams</i>

387
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:07,468
<i>and I'm looking for
a marriage license between</i>

388
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:09,206
<i>a Daniel Williams
and a Sarah Hart.</i>

389
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,611
Do I have the right office?

390
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:11,376
<i>(female)
You do.</i>

391
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:12,677
<i>What did you say
their names were?</i>

392
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,616
Daniel Williams
and Sarah Hart.

393
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,517
<i>What day was the wedding.</i>

394
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,021
I'm not sure, but it
Would have been someWhere

395
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,057
in September of 1990.

396
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,593
Okay, that'll take
a little time to research.

397
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,560
Can you call me back
in about a Week?

398
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:26,563
Sure.

399
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:44,809
Hi.

400
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,278
Hi, I'm trying to find some
information on my father.

401
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,616
When Was he born?

402
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:51,348
I don't knoW.

403
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:53,617
But he married my
mother in 1990.

404
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:55,352
That's a good
place to start.

405
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:56,825
Let's take a look at
the Austin neWspapers,

406
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,154
see if there's
a Wedding announcement.

407
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,164
Okay.

408
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,730
You knoW hoW to
use one of these?

409
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:11,571
Yeah.

410
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,305
I'm majoring in journalism.

411
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:16,244
Well, if you need me,
I'll be at my desk.

412
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,248
Thanks.

413
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:11,199
Are there any
other files here?

414
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,702
We have birth and
death certificates

415
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:15,364
from the health department
on computer noW.

416
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,771
<i>Think that might help?</i>

417
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:17,808
No.

418
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,400
Thanks for trying.

419
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,411
<i>Any time.</i>

420
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:45,267
Linder, NeW York.

421
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:46,735
I need the number for
the registrar's office

422
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:50,604
at Evergreen College.

423
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,781
Hi, yes, I'm checking to
see if a Daniel Williams

424
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:03,548
attended Evergreen in 1989.

425
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:06,181
Yes, I'll hold.

426
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,748
I've called every county
200 miles outside of NeW York

427
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:11,226
and Austin and no one has any
record of their marriage.

428
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:13,355
HoW can that be?

429
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:17,424
Maybe they eloped to some
exotic place like Niagara Falls.

430
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,834
Of course.

431
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:21,838
That's it.

432
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:48,596
So there's nothing in any of
the papers about a Wedding

433
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:51,226
betWeen a Daniel Williams
and Sarah Hart.

434
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,269
<i>(female)
We've checked
thoroughly, ma'am,</i>

435
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:54,532
but there are no Weddings
under that name.

436
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,596
<i>We are checking to see if
there's a change of name</i>

437
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,005
<i>petition on file.</i>

438
00:32:58,276 --> 00:32:59,573
Do you think that'll help?

439
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,475
No thanks, but
thanks for trying.

440
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:02,911
Okay, good luck.

441
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,278
<i>(male)
I found a Williams.</i>

442
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:09,013
Great, but I don't
need this anymore.

443
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:26,403
Hey.

444
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:29,770
Hey.

445
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,469
HoW's the neWspaper
business today?

446
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:34,738
You knoW, the stats on
"The Observer" look pretty good.

447
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:38,873
You going to make them
an offer they can't refuse?

448
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,783
Something like that.

449
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,844
You knoW, I haven't been fishing
since I Was a little boy

450
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:45,718
With my father.

451
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:50,352
Forgot hoW much I missed it.

452
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:54,330
HoW you doing?

453
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,060
Okay.

454
00:33:56,334 --> 00:34:01,704
It gets a little
easier every day.

455
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:06,073
What are you
going to do noW?

456
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:10,405
I don't knoW.

457
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:14,383
I think my mom Would have Wanted
me to do What makes me happy.

458
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:16,352
What makes you happy?

459
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:19,515
Writing stories, but
it doesn't pay the bills.

460
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:22,354
Well, sometimes you can make
a little money selling a story.

461
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:23,860
There's not much of
a market for short stories

462
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:25,657
and that's all I've got.

463
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,359
All these stories you've
Written all on one topic?

464
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:30,833
Sort of.

465
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,427
They're all about me.

466
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:36,837
Maybe you can put 'em
together, make a book out of it.

467
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:40,503
Yeah, maybe, but that
Would take a lot of time.

468
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,637
There's one thing you've
got on your hands, girl.

469
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:44,681
It's time.

470
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,775
Yeah, I guess you're right.

471
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:51,083
<i>But how do I eat if I
shut this place down?</i>

472
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:56,388
You're gonna have to figure
out some Way hoW to do both.

473
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:00,460
Did you go to
Evergreen College?

474
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:03,022
HoW did you knoW that?

475
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,126
I googled you.

476
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:07,530
I like to knoW a little
something about my guests.

477
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,469
Oh, really?

478
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:10,131
You just google
all your guests?

479
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:13,002
Did you find something
out important?

480
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:16,012
You like to ski
and climb mountains.

481
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,844
And you Won an aWard for
neWspaper man of the year.

482
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:22,408
That's pretty good.

483
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,921
You like to ski?

484
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:26,547
Never tried it.

485
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:27,750
What about climbing?

486
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:30,020
You like to climb mountains?

487
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:31,891
But I love neWspapers.

488
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,521
You love neWspapers?

489
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:36,692
Well, We've got something
in common, then.

490
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,166
<i>Whoa!</i>

491
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,495
Oh, yeah!

492
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:41,731
Get the net!
Get the net!

493
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:42,966
Look at that guy!

494
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,632
Look at that baby.

495
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:45,505
Look at him.

496
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:46,508
Look at him!

497
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:50,479
Whoo-hoo hoo!

498
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:52,641
Whoo-hoo hoo hoo!

499
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:54,912
Look at that thing.

500
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,783
SWeet!

501
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:10,129
HoW do We make
them go faster?

502
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:13,136
Ho, Whoa!

503
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:21,811
You really
Want to try that?

504
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:22,937
Please?

505
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,949
That Way.

506
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:30,080
Whoa!

507
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,649
Oh, sure,
let's go riding.

508
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:39,560
Of course, you'll
never Walk again.

509
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,758
That Was fun.

510
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:46,462
Does the pain
stop eventually?

511
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,697
Huh?

512
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:48,636
Maybe.

513
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,968
Go ahead
and laugh at me.

514
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,975
I'm getting
too old for this.

515
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,010
<i>(Mia)
I think he's my dad.</i>

516
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,843
<i>(Maxine)
What makes you think that?</i>

517
00:36:57,915 --> 00:36:59,780
<i>He was in the Gulf War.</i>

518
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,842
<i>He looks like me and he
was in the press corps.</i>

519
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,979
<i>Lots of people
were in the Gulf War,</i>

520
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,580
<i>even in the press corps.</i>

521
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:07,783
But they all didn't go to
Evergreen College

522
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:09,120
Where Mom Went.

523
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:10,251
Even if he Was your dad,

524
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,120
Why Would you Want
anything to do With him?

525
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:13,720
He left your mother and you

526
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:16,130
to fend for yourselves
all these years.

527
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,259
Maybe he got amnesia When
he Was missing in action.

528
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:19,628
It happens.

529
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:20,830
Maybe.

530
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:24,636
Maybe not.

531
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:27,507
He seems just like the guy
Mom used to tell me about

532
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,943
When I Was little.

533
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:30,878
You better
go sloW, Mia baby.

534
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:32,916
Men don't like being
accused of fathering

535
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:34,975
a child they
never kneW about.

536
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,519
I Will.

537
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:39,021
I Won't say anything
unless I've got some proof.

538
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,718
But really, I mean, Why Would
a guy like that be staying at

539
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,283
a B&B unless he Was my dad?

540
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:47,759
He'd be staying at the Four
Seasons in Austin, Wouldn't he?

541
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:50,858
Maybe he just likes
being in the country.

542
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:51,902
<i>(male)
Hey girls.</i>

543
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:53,527
Hey Travis.

544
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:57,199
What'll it be?

545
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,641
I feel like
a chocolate malt today.

546
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,678
Boy, you sure
don't look like one.

547
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:05,045
Be right back.

548
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:10,213
So hoW's the prettiest
girl in Arroyo Grande today?

549
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,119
Not bad.

550
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:14,657
Still got that neWspaper
guy at your place?

551
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:15,919
Yeah.

552
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:17,187
Don't like him.

553
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:19,229
He's nice.

554
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,288
Don't trust him.

555
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:24,163
You're sittin' on a gold
mine With that land

556
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,998
your mother left you.

557
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,300
NoW, there are going to be
people Who are gonna try

558
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:30,169
and take that from you.

559
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,641
He's nice once
you get to knoW him.

560
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,769
Don't trust him.

561
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:37,814
Well, you don't knoW
anything about him.

562
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:40,646
Well, I knoW he looks like
a man that left your mother.

563
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:42,652
Did you meet my father?

564
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,783
No, but this guy is either
him or it's his tWin brother.

565
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:50,691
Sarah shoWed me his
picture one time.

566
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:52,786
That's Weird.

567
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:54,228
I looked all over for
any picture of my dad

568
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:55,925
and I never found one.

569
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,127
NoW, don't go filling
her head With things

570
00:38:58,202 --> 00:38:59,226
you can't prove.

571
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:00,998
What can't he prove?

572
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:03,973
<i>(Maxine)
The guy staying at
Arrow Lake is Mia's father.</i>

573
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,373
<i>(female)
You know, there is one
way to find out for sure.</i>

574
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:09,272
Get him to take
a paternity test.

575
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,282
That's the only Way
to knoW for sure.

576
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,908
You think he Would?

577
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:16,384
You see the car
this guy drives?

578
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:19,282
He's got some big
bucks and not likely

579
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,382
he's gonna Want to share
any of it With Mia.

580
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,286
All I knoW is he lost
the best thing that he ever

581
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,226
had When he left Sarah.

582
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:26,763
<i>(Travis)
You're right about that.</i>

583
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:31,063
Mia, you Want me to knock
some sense into his head,

584
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,865
you just let me knoW.

585
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,399
As you can see, I made
the changes you requested.

586
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,645
Rob, thanks for coming.

587
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,304
This is my assistant,
Rob Jackson.

588
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,370
Rob.

589
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:46,939
He's gonna be my eyes and ears
around the place While I'm aWay.

590
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:49,008
So you're going to
keep everyone on staff?

591
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:50,314
That's my intention.

592
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:54,188
We look forward to
expanding, not cutting back.

593
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:57,386
That's not exactly
What We expected to hear.

594
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:59,827
<i>Well, I guess we have
some paperwork to sign.</i>

595
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,865
Excellent.

596
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:04,765
So What do you plan to do noW
that you've sold your business?

597
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:07,303
<i>I'm going on vacation.</i>

598
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:11,398
<i>I'm gonna visit some of those
places I've been writing about.</i>

599
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:14,774
I haven't been on
vacation in 20 years.

600
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:17,439
Well, it's high
time you go, then.

601
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,048
Afternoon, Travis.

602
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,058
I understand you
Want to see me.

603
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:30,058
Yep.

604
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:31,458
So What's up?

605
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,697
You knoW that neW
guy from NeW York?

606
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:34,992
NeWspaper guy?

607
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:38,000
Yeah, that's the one.

608
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:43,472
Well, I think he's
the one that killed Sarah.

609
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,470
That's a mighty big
accusation, Travis.

610
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:48,473
You got anything
to back it up?

611
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:52,910
I hear he's got some
front end damage to his car.

612
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:56,976
You don't say.

613
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:58,351
Thanks.

614
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:01,323
Anytime.

615
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:06,386
ToWn is just not
the same Without Sarah.

616
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,432
Nope.

617
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:15,969
<i>(Daniel)
Hey.</i>

618
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,337
Hey.

619
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:18,932
It's almost tea
time, isn't it?

620
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:20,203
Yeah.

621
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:23,440
Everything's ready;
let me just get it for you.

622
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,513
Some homemade
scones and cream.

623
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,516
My favorite.

624
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:42,123
WoW.

625
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,928
Mom's recipe.

626
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:47,994
Mm, she must have
been a great cook.

627
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:53,009
I've had scones at the Ritz
that didn't taste this good.

628
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:55,011
Where is everybody?

629
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,047
Well, the honeymooners
Went home and

630
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:59,412
Ed's off to see his
customers in Oklahoma.

631
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:01,451
But We'll have a full
house again this Weekend.

632
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,952
Excellent.

633
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,954
I'm going to do some
Work out on the patio.

634
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:09,254
God knoWs I have plenty to do
noW that I bought the paper.

635
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,263
Does that mean you'll be
staying around for aWhile?

636
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,558
I'm not sure yet.

637
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:16,561
We'll have to see.

638
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:08,846
Hey Bobby.

639
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,888
What are you doing?

640
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:14,481
I'm Workin' on this car.

641
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:16,287
What's Wrong With it?

642
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,022
Needs a neW starter.

643
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:24,090
Had any cars come in
With some front end damage?

644
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,294
No sir.

645
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,496
HoW about any vehicles
shoWin' red paint skin off

646
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:29,300
another car?

647
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:31,307
No sir.

648
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:37,274
No sir.

649
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:40,374
You'd tell me if
you did, Wouldn't you?

650
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,943
Yes, sir.

651
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:48,117
Well, you give me a call
if you see anything like that,

652
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:49,523
okay?

653
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:51,527
Yes, sir.

654
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,990
We'll go over that When
We get back to the office.

655
00:43:57,067 --> 00:44:00,127
Mia, I'd like you to meet
my neW assistant, Rob.

656
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:02,297
Rob's from out of toWn.

657
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:03,670
He's lookin' for
a place to stay,

658
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:05,966
so listen to What
I've Worked out.

659
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:08,011
Remember you've been telling
me it's hard to, you knoW,

660
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:09,568
go to school full-time
and run this place?

661
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:10,443
Yeah.

662
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:12,038
Well, Rob's your man.

663
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:13,606
He's going to be your
help around here, okay?

664
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:15,174
He's going to move in.

665
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:17,015
I'll pay his rent, so
don't Worry about that.

666
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:20,022
In exchange, he's going to do
Whatever you Want around here.

667
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,114
HoW's that sound?

668
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:22,556
Sounds great.

669
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:23,650
When does he start?

670
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:25,285
HoW about right noW?

671
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:27,296
Rob, haul this
to the kitchen.

672
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:28,558
Good man.

673
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:30,623
You see that?

674
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,168
Not much business
for a Saturday.

675
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:36,706
Everybody's
at the rodeo.

676
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:38,601
Yee-haW.

677
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,167
I knoW you think he left
mom high and dry,

678
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:44,703
but What if he lost his memory
When he Was missing in action?

679
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:46,973
Maybe that's Why
he never called.

680
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:48,279
I don't knoW.

681
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,411
<i>Look, he's the best thing
that's happened to me,</i>

682
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:52,682
<i>except for you and Mom.</i>

683
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:20,741
Where'd you get that?

684
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:24,215
I found it after Mom died.

685
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:27,121
It Was in an old cedar
box up in her closet.

686
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:29,989
What Was she doing
With this clipping?

687
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,324
You tell me.

688
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:36,560
My mother told me that my father
Was named Daniel Williams,

689
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:40,694
that he Was in the Gulf War,
that he Was declared

690
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:44,263
missing in action in 1990 and
she never heard from him again.

691
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:48,038
Is that clipping
talking about you?

692
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:49,272
Yes.

693
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:51,541
I Was MIA for three
and a half months,

694
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:53,776
but I never met your mother.

695
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:55,712
She Went to Evergreen College

696
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:58,118
and that's Where
she met Daniel Williams.

697
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:04,388
Look, is there any Way you
could have been injured,

698
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:07,487
forgot about her?

699
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:13,230
Listen, I knoW it must
have been hard not having

700
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:15,533
a father When you
Were groWing up.

701
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:18,632
<i>You just lost your mother.</i>

702
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:21,610
<i>But I was never injured.</i>

703
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:23,077
I never had amnesia.

704
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:28,312
I remember everything before,
during, and after my capture.

705
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:35,348
<i>As much as I wish it was
true, I'm not your father.</i>

706
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:37,325
From What I gather, your
mother's not the type of person

707
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:42,297
that a man Would forget.

708
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:45,199
NeW York City's a big place.

709
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:49,228
There's probably dozens
of Daniel Williams' there.

710
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:53,242
She probably
married one of them.

711
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:13,721
<i>(Mia)
And then he said Mom

712
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:17,392
some other Daniel Williams.

713
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,492
Did you find any
records at city hall?

714
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:22,232
No.

715
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:24,141
Maybe We got
it all Wrong.

716
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:24,869
Maybe We got
it all Wrong.

717
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:26,803
But it all fits.

718
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,847
Hey, Where's the fire?

719
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:39,320
NoWhere.

720
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:41,186
I just got a lot on
my plate right noW.

721
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:43,123
Oh yeah, I heard
about your mom.

722
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,354
I'm sorry to hear
about the accident.

723
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:47,590
Thanks.

724
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:49,393
Seems to me like you could
use a little bit of fun

725
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:51,627
in your life right noW.

726
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:55,194
HoW about I pick
you up at 8:00?

727
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:59,868
Oh, I appreciate
the offer, but I can't.

728
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:08,912
Okay, Mom.

729
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:11,654
You Win.

730
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:16,250
Hey, Chuck, is that
offer still open?

731
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:17,384
Yeah, sure.

732
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:19,486
What time should
I be ready?

733
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:20,587
I live at the...

734
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:22,256
The ArroW Lake B&B,
I knoW.

735
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:24,857
I'll be there at 8:00.

736
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:26,266
Okay.

737
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:28,270
Bye.
Bye.

738
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,810
<i>(Chuck)
And then my little
brother walks in the room</i>

739
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:36,675
and I Was just done.

740
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,545
Will there be
anything else, sir?

741
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:40,810
Oh no, that's good.

742
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:44,183
Thank you, sir.

743
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:47,417
Oh, I did not
realize hoW late it Was.

744
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:49,288
We missed the start
of the last movie.

745
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:52,658
It's okay.

746
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:56,961
I have never met someone
Who's just so easy to talk to.

747
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,794
You Want to go
listen to some music?

748
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,303
I don't knoW.

749
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:03,532
I have a lot of people
coming in tomorroW,

750
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,575
so We should
probably get going.

751
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:11,274
Well, We can just
go for one dance, please.

752
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:16,218
Okay.

753
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,220
All right.

754
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:48,908
Here We are,
tWo gin and tonics.

755
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,454
Thanks.

756
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:52,954
You must come here a lot.

757
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:54,684
Mostly With my roommate.

758
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:56,885
Uh huh, your roommate
likes gin and tonics.

759
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,292
Yeah, Who doesn't?

760
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:00,887
I've never had one.

761
00:50:00,964 --> 00:50:03,262
Really?

762
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:08,270
Then you are in
for a real treat.

763
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:31,823
You knoW, I read
those pages you gave me.

764
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:33,795
You got some talent.

765
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,058
HoW much have you Written?

766
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:36,560
About 100.

767
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:38,828
That's good.

768
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:43,703
I haven't had much time to
Write on it since Mom's died.

769
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:47,403
Well, you try to
Write a page a day

770
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:50,674
and it'll be done
before you knoW it.

771
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:54,444
I guess I could
do that much.

772
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:57,078
Well, I better
get to bed.

773
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:59,948
Thank you for the tea.

774
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:08,092
<i>Hey, are you sure
you never met my mom?</i>

775
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:10,663
Yeah.

776
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:14,465
I'm sure.

777
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:17,701
<i>You sleep well.</i>

778
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:20,038
Good night.

779
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:26,379
(Whispers)
Night, Dad.

780
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:41,724
<i>(Bobby)
Just came in
this morning.</i>

781
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:43,129
Excellent.

782
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,867
HoW long Will it
take to fix it?

783
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,130
About an hour.

784
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:48,871
An hour.

785
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:52,067
Tell you What, Why don't
you make it 30 minutes?

786
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:54,133
Yes, sir.

787
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:56,971
Mr. Williams?

788
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:59,015
You already paid
for the part.

789
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:02,142
That's right,
that's for you.

790
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:05,855
I get right
on that, sir.

791
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:10,426
<i>(Maxine)
Think it's a good idea for
you to be staying at the B&B?</i>

792
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:12,394
I think it's a great idea.

793
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:15,124
It's close to the paper
and I like it there.

794
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:17,564
That's not
What I meant.

795
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,761
Haven't you
hurt her enough?

796
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:21,633
What are you
talking about?

797
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:24,037
Don't play dumb With me.

798
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:26,905
You knoW Who
I'm talking about.

799
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,035
Mia.

800
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:29,908
I Would never hurt Mia.

801
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,642
You left her mother to fend
for herself for all those years.

802
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:35,776
Not so much as a postcard to
let her knoW you Were okay.

803
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:37,649
Look, I'm going to
tell you one more time, okay.

804
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:39,689
I Want you to listen to this;

805
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:41,451
I'm not Mia's father.

806
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:42,685
Okay, I never met her mother.

807
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:44,659
You're looking at the
Wrong Daniel Williams.

808
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:46,195
That's What I thought
at first, but I've seen

809
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,760
the neWspaper clippings.

810
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,128
I couldn't have left her.

811
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:51,133
I never met Sarah.

812
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:53,669
I've been a bachelor
for the past 20 years.

813
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:55,932
You don't strike me
as the bachelor type.

814
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,530
Thank you.

815
00:52:57,607 --> 00:53:02,635
I'll try that special.

816
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:05,078
Bring me an official
taster While you're at it.

817
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:09,548
Seems like everybody
in toWn hates me.

818
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:10,745
So?

819
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:11,946
Get a paternity test.

820
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,990
Where am I gonna
do that out here?

821
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:15,718
You can do it
on the Internet.

822
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:17,885
Just send in some of
your DNA, some of Mia's,

823
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:19,189
see if it's a match.

824
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:20,889
Well, it Won't be.

825
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:21,953
Then you'll have proof.

826
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:25,968
And all these meat-heads from
Mayberry Will leave you alone.

827
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,867
Sounds like
a pretty good idea.

828
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:29,872
I'll think about it.

829
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,970
<i>I hope Mia lets us
cook up these fish.</i>

830
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,103
Hope so too.

831
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:03,605
[doorbell ringing]

832
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:07,904
Can I help you, sheriff?

833
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:09,536
Need to speak
With you in private.

834
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:11,137
Do you mind?

835
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:12,647
Yes, sir.

836
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:14,581
Had a report that you
had some front end damage

837
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:15,675
to your car.

838
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:16,684
Is that true?

839
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,550
Yes, sir.
Is that a crime?

840
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:19,850
Depends.

841
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,891
I see it's been fixed.

842
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:23,687
Had Bobby take
care of it in toWn.

843
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,091
Kid does good Work.

844
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:27,152
I kneW that boy
Was lying.

845
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,288
Sorry, sir?

846
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:30,032
Never mind.

847
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,160
Where Were you When
Sarah Williams Was murdered?

848
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:35,704
Murdered?

849
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:38,036
I thought her death
Was an accident.

850
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:41,043
It Was, but Whoever
hit her left the scene of

851
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:44,911
the accident and is
responsible for her death.

852
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:46,642
Well, that Wasn't me, sir.

853
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:47,910
Can you prove it?

854
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:49,952
NoW sheriff, I
didn't kill anybody.

855
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,545
HoW'd you get that
front end damage?

856
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,682
I hit a deer just
outside of Arroyo Grande

857
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:57,192
the night I got in toWn.

858
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:01,321
Mind if I take
a closer look at your car?

859
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:05,328
That Was great.

860
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:07,035
Here, I'll get those.

861
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:10,231
Thank you.

862
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,632
So hoW's

863

Were going to help me.

Just be a moment.

869
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,300
Hide this.

870
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,939

San Marcos?

Thirty miles
south of Austin.

878

Oh yeah.

879
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,116

<i>I'm going to ask you
a couple of questions.</i>

1071
01:05:51,647 --> 01:05:52,705
<i>This guy, Chuck.</i>

1072
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:55,273
Tell me What he did.

1073
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:58,548
I'm not even sure if he
tried to rape me or not.

1074
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:01,215
Let me be
the judge of that.

1075
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:03,758
Okay.

1076
01:06:03,826 --> 01:06:04,986
Where do I start?

1077
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:06,262
Start from the beginning.

1078
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:08,727
HoW long have
you knoWn Chuck?

1079
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:13,297
What you doing?

1080
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:14,961
Oh, just some
bookkeeping.

1081
01:06:15,037 --> 01:06:16,436
Brought you some tea.

1082
01:06:16,505 --> 01:06:17,437
I am so sorry.

1083
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:18,803
I completely forgot
What time it Was.

1084
01:06:18,874 --> 01:06:23,470
Don't be silly,
I knoW hoW to make tea.

1085
01:06:23,546 --> 01:06:26,481
I might sit out here
and keep you company.

1086
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:28,779
Read my paper.

1087
01:07:28,644 --> 01:07:30,544
Got a minute?

1088
01:07:30,613 --> 01:07:32,547
I've got a class
in 10 minutes.

1089
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:34,708
This Won't take long.

1090
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:36,809
Okay.

1091
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:40,822
I'm going to
need you to testify.

1092
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,586
The other girl dropped out

1093
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:45,354
and if you don't testify,

1094
01:07:45,428 --> 01:07:48,955
Chuck's going to get aWay With
this, just like his father did.

1095
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:50,589
His father?

1096
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:54,397
Yeah, it runs
in the family.

1097
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:57,667
TWenty-some years ago, Chuck's
father raped me and I don't knoW

1098
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:01,699
hoW many other girls in this
county, so this is personal.

1099
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:03,904
Whatever happened
to his father?

1100
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:05,537
Nothing.

1101
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:06,979
Things Were
different back then.

1102
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:08,710
No one Would
have believed us.

1103
01:08:08,784 --> 01:08:10,547
What Was his name?

1104
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:12,780
Lonnie,
Lonnie Rogers.

1105
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:14,652
I'll never forget it.

1106
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:17,954
Good looking With
a rattler tattoo.

1107
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:19,790
The big football hero.

1108
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:21,693
Yep, that's the one.

1109
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,994
Thought he Was God's
gift to the World.

1110
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:27,695
Hell, I'm surprised there aren't
20 little Chucks running around.

1111
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,431
I don't knoW.

1112
01:08:29,505 --> 01:08:31,871
I'm just noW starting to
get my life back to normal.

1113
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:34,432
Can you live With the idea that
you might have done

1114
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:36,068
something to prevent
this from happening

1115
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:39,546
to another girl
and didn't?

1116
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:41,606
Here's my card.

1117
01:08:41,684 --> 01:08:43,015
Call me.

1118
01:08:48,824 --> 01:08:49,916
Hey, Mia.

1119
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:51,584
Hey.

1120
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:52,649
What's this?

1121
01:08:52,728 --> 01:08:53,660
Your mail.

1122
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:55,424
Thought I'd deliver it
since I Was coming by.

1123
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:56,965
Thanks.

1124
01:08:57,032 --> 01:08:58,021
You gonna open that?

1125
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,089
I'll Wait.

1126
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:00,157
Hey ladies,
What's going on.

1127
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:01,164
Hey, We're
going to a movie.

1128
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:02,131
Want to come?

1129
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:03,171
Oh, I'm going
to pass on that,

1130
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,566
but you guys have
a good time.

1131
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:24,581
Yes, is Rosemary Landry in?

1132
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:27,178
This is Mia Williams.

1133
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:32,216
<i>Would you please let her know
that I've decided to testify?</i>

1134
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:34,888
<i>Yeah, she has my number.</i>

1135
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:37,899
Okay, thanks.

1136
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,266
<i>You heard?</i>

1137
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:48,067
Yeah.

1138
01:10:48,143 --> 01:10:54,673
I Want you to knoW I'll be there
every step of the Way With you.

1139
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:56,684
Thanks, Daniel.

1140
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:07,921
You ain't got
nothin' on me.

1141
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:09,897
Every one of those
girls Wanted it.

1142
01:11:09,965 --> 01:11:11,762
Like tWo peas in a pod.

1143
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:13,165
What's that
supposed to mean?

1144
01:11:13,235 --> 01:11:16,295
It means you're the spitting
image of your slack-jaW father.

1145
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:19,905
<i>But unlike your father, we've
got someone who will testify</i>

1146
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:21,636
and she has a Witness.

1147
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:26,044
<i>Hey sheriff, what
brings you here?</i>

1148
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:32,748
Mr. Jones told me that he saW
a black blur hit Sarah's car,

1149
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:35,221
<i>but I didn't find any evidence
on her car that she hit</i>

1150
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:38,089
<i>anything but concrete barrier.</i>

1151
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:43,792
<i>So I got to thinking,
what if he was right?</i>

1152
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:47,199
That Would mean that
there'd be a car

1153
01:11:47,269 --> 01:11:50,102
With some red paint
on it someWhere.

1154
01:11:50,172 --> 01:11:51,264
Mm-hmm.

1155
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:53,808
<i>I asked Bobby to give me
a call if he saw any car</i>

1156
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:56,743
With any red paint on it.

1157
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:58,302
<i>And he did.</i>

1158
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:04,683
<i>Told me that Chuck's car
had some red paint on it.</i>

1159
01:12:04,753 --> 01:12:07,813
So I took a little
drive over to Chuck's.

1160
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:11,917
He Weren't home,
but his pickup Was.

1161
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:15,623
<i>Had it checked out.</i>

1162
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:17,825
It Was a match.

1163
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:21,165
<i>(Rosemary)
We got him
on manslaughter.</i>

1164
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:24,103
<i>That's better than
attempted rape any day.</i>

1165
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:27,734
You're going doWn for
a long time, Chuckie.

1166
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:31,177
And you're gonna be real popular
'cause I hear the boys

1167
01:12:31,246 --> 01:12:34,181
love it When
the rapists arrive.

1168
01:12:37,986 --> 01:12:39,647
<i>Get him out of here.</i>

1169
01:12:39,722 --> 01:12:41,656
C'mon.

1170
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:47,153
Hey.

1171
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:48,856
Hey.

1172
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:50,922
<i>I got here as soon as I
could... is everything okay?</i>

1173
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:52,660
Everything is excellent.

1174
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,293
I just Wanted to let you knoW
that I spoke to a good friend

1175
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:57,362
of mine in NeW York City today
that happens to be a big agent.

1176
01:12:57,439 --> 01:13:00,306
And he Wants to read the
first 50 pages of your book.

1177
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:01,934
Are you serious?

1178
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:03,409
I'm very serious.

1179
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:04,976
Come on, I Want to
take you to lunch.

1180
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,014
Where do you Want to go?

1181
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:07,742
Are you sure We're not
celebrating a little early?

1182
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:09,283
Do you knoW hoW hard it
is to get an agent like this

1183
01:13:09,351 --> 01:13:10,875
to read your material?

1184
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:11,851
Pretty hard, huh?

1185
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,285
Where are We goin'?

1186
01:13:13,355 --> 01:13:16,188
I've got
the perfect place.

1187
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:24,822
<i>(Daniel)
This place
smells unbelievable.</i>

1188
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:25,992
Wait until you taste it.

1189
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:27,399
You gonna have
some potato salad?

1190
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:29,266
Yes, please.

1191
01:13:29,338 --> 01:13:30,703
Oh, look at that.

1192
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:32,240
My Lord, What is that?

1193
01:13:32,307 --> 01:13:33,968
That is family style.

1194
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:35,100
Trust me.

1195
01:13:35,177 --> 01:13:36,906
Family style is huge.

1196
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:38,276
What do We got in here?

1197
01:13:38,347 --> 01:13:40,338
Meat, ribs.

1198
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,179
I'm gonna get this
stuff all over me.

1199
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,014
It'll look good on you.

1200
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,144
So you have
any plans later?

1201
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:46,915
Not really.

1202
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:49,753
Hey, there's a really
good band playing over

1203
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:51,122
at the Road House tonight.

1204
01:13:51,193 --> 01:13:52,057
Oh, yeah, the Road House.

1205
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,389
That's one of my

What'll it be?

1213
01:14:24,326 --> 01:14:25,953
TWo long necks, please.

1214
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:28,292
Coming right up.

1215
01:14:28,363 --> 01:14:30,763
You didn't Want some?

TWo Long Necks.

1217
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:38,930
<i>(Travis)
I done told you, I

1218
01:14:39,007 --> 01:14:40,998
Travis, have
you lost your mind?

1219
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:42,976
Mia, this is
betWeen him and me.

1220
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:46,071
I don't Want
his kind in here.

1221
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,917
And What kind
might that be?

1222
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:52,886
<i>The kind that would leave
a woman who is pregnant</i>

1223
01:14:52,955 --> 01:14:56,482
Without a dime When it's his
baby and never look back.

1224
01:14:56,558 --> 01:15:00,517
And then come prancing in here,
trying to make everything okay.

1225
01:15:00,796 --> 01:15:02,127
<i>Well, it ain't okay.</i>

1226
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:04,392
<i>(Maxine)
Travis, you got
it all wrong.</i>

1227
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:06,127
Oh, What's this?

1228
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:08,135
He's got you under
his spell noW too?

1229
01:15:08,203 --> 01:15:10,262
No, not under any spell.

1230
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,000
You better calm
yourself doWn.

1231
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:14,770
Don't tell me to
calm doWn in my oWn bar.

1232
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:17,778
<i>Are you gonna leave or am I
gonna drag you out of here?</i>

1233
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:19,404
<i>'Cause you're not gonna pull
the wool over her eyes</i>

1234
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:21,073
like you did her mother's.

1235
01:15:21,149 --> 01:15:23,276
<i>Now get out of here!</i>

1236
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:26,219
Fine.

1237
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:30,156
Get your purse
and let's go.

1238
01:15:30,225 --> 01:15:31,886
With her you're not.

1239
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:35,088
Get your hands
off of my daughter.

1240
01:15:35,163 --> 01:15:36,255
What'd you say?

1241
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:42,895
I said, "get your hands
off of my daughter."

1242
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:45,568
I'm sorry.

1243
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:48,332
I Was just afraid
to admit it.

1244
01:15:57,519 --> 01:16:01,250
Mr. Williams, guess
I oWe you an apology.

1245
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:03,382
Apology accepted.

1246
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:07,918
NoW ladies, let's go.

1247
01:16:15,137 --> 01:16:17,901
Travis, you okay?

1248
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:19,406
Yeah, I guess so.

1249
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:21,374
I'll alWays
miss her though.

1250
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:23,206
Sarah?

1251
01:16:23,278 --> 01:16:24,540
Yeah.

1252
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:27,207
I asked her to
marry me once.

1253
01:16:27,282 --> 01:16:29,614
She laughed and said
she Was already married.

1254
01:16:29,885 --> 01:16:33,150
Did not knoW that.

1255
01:16:33,221 --> 01:16:34,415
One hell of a Woman.

1256
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:37,893
Some day,
she's gonna miss you

1257
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:39,019
Some day,
she's gonna miss you

1258
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:51,038
Is there a Miss Williams
in the house?

1259
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:52,334
Hey Daniel.

1260
01:16:52,407 --> 01:16:54,637
I got something for you.

1261
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:57,378
Better take a look.

1262
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:58,640
Hurry up.

1263
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:01,109
Open it!

1264
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:10,080
They've accepted
my book proposal!

1265
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:11,523
Thank you so much.

1266
01:17:11,593 --> 01:17:13,390
I can't believe it.

1267
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:14,326
Well, you better
believe it.

1268
01:17:14,396 --> 01:17:17,126
You only have 200 more
pages to come up With.

1269
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:19,360
I Wish Mom could
have seen this.

1270
01:17:19,434 --> 01:17:20,526
She can.

1271
01:17:20,602 --> 01:17:23,594
Sounds like a cause for
a celebration if you ask me.

1272
01:17:23,672 --> 01:17:25,264
We've got tWo
things to celebrate.

1273
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:26,398
What's that?

1274
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:29,273
Maxine and I have decided
to go into business together.

1275
01:17:29,344 --> 01:17:31,505
She's buying half of the B&B,
so I'll be able to go back

1276
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:33,445
to university in the spring.

1277
01:17:33,515 --> 01:17:34,982
You don't have
to go back to Work.

1278
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:36,540
I can put my only
daughter through college.

1279
01:17:36,618 --> 01:17:39,553
We've got a lot of
catching up to do.

1280
01:17:39,621 --> 01:17:45,025
I appreciate the offer,
but it meant a lot to Mom.

1281
01:17:45,093 --> 01:17:46,924
I Want to keep it open.

1282
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:49,293
<i>(Daniel)
Then you should.</i>

1283
01:17:49,364 --> 01:17:51,967
Well heck, Welcome
to the B&B business.

1284
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:53,025
Well heck, Welcome
to the B&B business.

1285
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:26,493
What'll it be?

1286
01:18:26,568 --> 01:18:28,001
One Stars all around.

1287
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:31,665
You got it.

1288
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:33,173
I'm not going to
go to there.

1289
01:18:33,241 --> 01:18:34,139
It's not gonna happen.

1290
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:35,005
Travis.

1291
01:18:35,077 --> 01:18:35,975
Thank you.

1292
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:37,477
Welcome to Arroyo Grande.

1293
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:38,376
Thank you very much.

1294
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:39,243
You're Welcome.

1295
01:18:39,314 --> 01:18:40,611
Get on that floor.

1296
01:18:40,682 --> 01:18:44,413
Girl, you're not
getting me out there.

1297
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:24,758
There's still something
I don't understand.

1298
01:19:24,826 --> 01:19:27,556
What's that?

1299
01:19:27,629 --> 01:19:31,690
I knoW you're
not Mia's father.

1300
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:33,496
HoW do you knoW that?

1301
01:19:33,568 --> 01:19:35,536
I opened the lab report.

1302
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:36,798
I knoW I shouldn't
have done it,

1303
01:19:37,072 --> 01:19:38,801
but I Was so afraid you
Were gonna hurt her.

1304
01:19:39,074 --> 01:19:41,668
I'll never tell.

1305
01:19:41,743 --> 01:19:45,679
HoW come you tWo have
the same last name?

1306
01:19:45,747 --> 01:19:48,375
I did a little
homeWork on that.

1307
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,179
I guess Sarah Went to
a NeW York City district court

1308
01:19:50,252 --> 01:19:52,220
and had her name changed.

1309
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:54,152
She must have loved Mia an
awful lot to go through

1310
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:58,420
all that trouble.

1311
01:19:58,493 --> 01:20:00,518
We better keep it secret.

1312
01:20:12,707 --> 01:20:14,732
When are you going
back to NeW York?

1313
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:16,243
I don't knoW.

1314
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:18,836
I kind of like it here,
I may never go back.

1315
01:20:26,721 --> 01:20:29,087
Well, you keep that up,
I'm going to leave tonight.

1316
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:30,522
Did you see that?

1317
01:20:30,592 --> 01:20:32,457
What the heck Was that?

1318
01:20:32,527 --> 01:20:34,392
Hit my ball doWn in the pool.

1319
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:36,692
My gosh.

1320
01:20:36,765 --> 01:20:39,199
<i>I'm comin' after
that yellow ball, girl.</i>

1321
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,940
