1
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,061
(Latin-flavored introduction
to "Dixie")

2
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:30,563
Yo, man. Miky, Miky...

3
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:34,067
?Yo... te estoy llamando...?

4
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:36,069
Hey, what's happening,
what's happening?

5
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,072
We'll just start from the top.

6
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:41,074
Well, I guess I started stealin'
when I was eight

7
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,576
milk and bread
for my baby sister and brother.

8
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:45,578
And other times,
just walking at the supermarket

9
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,580
just eating food right off
the aisles and not even paying.

10
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,082
We walk right outside, you know.

11
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:51,084
Now, when you think
of Latin writers,
you probably think

12
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,585
of Garcia Marquez

13
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:55,088
Neruda, Cortazar
and Magic Realism.

14
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:56,589
Not here... not this.

15
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:58,091
There are no
floating butterflies

16
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,593
around my head when I walk down
Avenue "B", you know?

17
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:02,095
This is street reality.

18
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,596
This is where we shout it out.

19
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:06,599
풲u sabes?

20
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,601
?Tierra va temblar, Santiago?

21
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:12,105
?Tierra va temblar,
Camaguay?

22
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,606
?Que no me llore,
que no me llore?

23
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:15,608
?Mira, Monina?

24
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:18,611
?Negrona linda...?

25
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:21,114
?Get out of my way?

26
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,615
? Ugly woman ?

27
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:23,616
?Get out of my way?

28
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:25,618
? You're not here to stay ?

29
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:27,120
?Get out of my way?

30
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,621
? Yes, I know you, baby ?

31
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:29,622
?Get out of my way?

32
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:32,625
? You got to get out
of my way ?

33
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,127
?Get out of my way?

34
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:36,129
? Ugly woman ?

35
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,630
?Get out of my way?

36
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,632
? Get out of my way,
pretty babe ?

37
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:40,633
?Get out of my way?

38
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,135
? Yeah, baby, you make it ?

39
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,636
?Get out of my way?

40
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:46,639
? You got to get out
of my way. ?

41
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:54,147
PINERO:
All right, check it out,
check it out, check it out.

42
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,649
Black woman with
a blonde wig on:

43
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:59,652
can you imagine yourself
onTo Tell the Truth

44
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:01,654
with three blondes
on blonde.

45
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:05,158
Free... slave...
black... 21.

46
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,659
If I have one life
to live

47
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,161
let me live it
as a blonde.

48
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,663
Black woman with
a blonde wig on.

49
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:13,166
(laughing)

50
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:18,171
You wrote that shit?

51
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:25,178
Well, yeah.

52
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,682
That's some pretty good shit,
man.

53
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,684
You know, if I was you

54
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:33,686
I would get with that dude,
uh, Marvin

55
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:35,188
with the writing program, man.

56
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:37,190
Yeah, yeah, I mean,
if I had your talent

57
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,191
I definitely
would.

58
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,193
Yeah?

59
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,698
Get you out of here.

60
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,209
At least, I won't
have to sleep

61
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,711
with my hand covering
my ass tonight.

62
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,713
Not tonight.

63
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:08,721
Man, I got to get
the hell out of here.

64
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,723
Just keep writing, bro.

65
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:13,226
Motherfuckers don't fuck
with entertainment.

66
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:24,737
Miguel Pinero... 150614.

67
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,739
Yeah, can I say something

68
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,741
before I get started?

69
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,243
I'd just like to thank
the parole board

70
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,744
for letting me express myself

71
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:34,247
here today, and I leave it

72
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,748
to your good conscience

73
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:38,751
to consider my release,
and hopefully soon.

74
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:43,756
Jesus Christ! I'm trying to
do you a favor... it's a steal.

75
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,759
No, I ain't saying
you steal it.

76
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,761
I stole it to sell it
to you at a steal.

77
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:49,762
Go ahead, check it out.

78
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:50,763
Go ahead,mira.

79
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,765
I'm not going to bite you.

80
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,267
Go ahead.

81
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,768
A Bulova for $20.

82
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:56,769
(coughing)

83
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,774
Fuck... if I wasn't sick...

84
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:04,277
See, I'm Malo the Merchant.

85
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,778
Nowmaloin Spanish
means "bad."

86
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:07,780
Not "bad" as in "bad,"
but "bad" as in "good."

87
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,282
And I'm so good,
it's terrible.

88
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:10,783
I'm bad. Can you dig it?

89
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:13,286
Five years for stealing?

90
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,787
Why would you want
to steal

91
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,789
when you got it all, Miky?

92
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,292
You have no idea how many times
I've asked myself

93
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:20,793
"What are we doing here?

94
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,295
Why did we leave Puerto Rico?"

95
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,798
To become doormen and waiters
and junkies and supers

96
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,800
dope dealers, pimps,
welfare parasites.

97
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:30,803
The fact is...

98
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,805
I am the cause
for the state's great concern

99
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,307
with drugs nowadays.

100
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:37,310
When they came to me,
I got it for them.

101
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,812
Now, they say that dope

102
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:43,816
is destroying the youth
of our nation.

103
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,318
Well, not my nation,
their nation

104
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,320
'cause for years it
had been destroying our nation

105
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,822
and no one gave a good fuck
about it.

106
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,824
Speak with your eyes,
look with your mouth

107
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,826
and you'll be okay.

108
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,328
When are we going
to yell out

109
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,330
"No more fucking dope, man!"

110
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,836
You are surprised that I,

111
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:06,339
a dope fiend, would make
such a distinction

112
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,340
between me and my peers?

113
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,842
But you see...
the time before this

114
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:12,345
there was the time
before that

115
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:15,848
and that's where I live,
in the time before this.

116
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,850
The day we left Puerto Rico

117
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,352
I remember
my grandmother crying

118
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:20,853
trying to pull me back.

119
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,856
It was like she knew
something bad

120
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,858
was gonna happen.

121
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,860
Can you dig that?

122
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:54,887
(trumpet playing piercing
jazz riff)

123
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:01,894
(siren blaring
in distance)

124
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:19,912
WOMAN:
Who is it?

125
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,414
It's me. Miky.

126
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,416
You alone?

127
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,419
No, I'm with myself.

128
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,920
Just call me Monty Hall

129
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,422
and let's make a deal.

130
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,424
All right, check it out.
Check it out.

131
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,425
It's an expensive watch.

132
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,926
Cheap.

133
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:34,927
Cheaper than cheap.

134
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:35,928
In fact, it's so cheap

135
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,430
that if I sell it you
any cheaper

136
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,931
you'll be stealing it from me,
퓍u sabes?

137
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,436
The poetry man.

138
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,438
You got some shit
with you, bro.

139
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:48,941
Mira, Pani.Al Pacino wore
this watch inSerpico.

140
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:49,942
Yeah, right.

141
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,444
For real, bro.
I swear to God.

142
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,446
Now, listen, man,
let me see it there.

143
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,448
Man, that watch
don't work, man.

144
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,449
It's all right, bro.

145
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,451
You don't need to know
the time all the time.

146
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,953
In fact, you'll live longer
with a watch that don't work,
퓍u sabes?

147
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:01,954
Check it out.

148
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:02,955
You got some
pair ofbolas.

149
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,457
You know that shit, man?

150
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,958
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

151
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,461
Mira, Pablito,you
 don't look so good.

152
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:11,464
You got a little money for me?

153
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,466
I'm shy about three
dollars-- here.
Oh, man!

154
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:14,967
I'll pay you next
Tuesday, all right?

155
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:15,968
Man, you something else.

156
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:17,470
Always doing
the same thing, man.

157
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,471
I ain't doing it
next time.

158
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,972
I'll pay you next
week, all right?

159
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,974
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Same story.

160
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,993
You know, Doctor, I spent
my whole life living like

161
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:43,996
there's no sickness,
no dying, no nothing.

162
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:46,999
So, now the clock is ticking.

163
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:52,004
I don't know, all of a sudden
I feel kind of corny.

164
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,507
You know?

165
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:57,009
It's your liver
saying "enough."

166
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,511
I'm really sorry.

167
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,515
So, what? Six months?

168
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,518
Ah... I don't know.

169
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:10,022
The way you live, who knows?

170
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:13,025
You know, my best friend Tito,
he died two days ago.

171
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,527
Got crushed by an icebox.

172
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,532
He never saw it coming,
you know?

173
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:22,535
I guess I'm not that bad off,
you know?

174
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,545
(siren blaring in distance)

175
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,551
MIKY:
Hello, Professor!

176
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,052
I got Cabernet 1967

177
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,555
Duck mousse a la port,
garlic crisps

178
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,557
theNational Book Review

179
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,559
and the latest copy
ofScrew-- What else?

180
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,561
Cuchifritos.
Let's celebrate.

181
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,563
What are we celebrating?

182
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,064
Life, baby. Life.

183
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,570
Shit, I don't care
what the doctors say, man.

184
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,573
Worst case scenario,
not a bad life.

185
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,577
Don Johnson, that's
a pretty motherfucker.

186
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,578
Mm-hmm.

187
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,580
Check this out.

188
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,082
Remember that night
at Burroughs bunker?

189
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,084
I asked him
where the bathroom was.

190
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:14,086
He said, "It's right over there.

191
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,088
Come on, I'll
pee with you."

192
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:17,089
(both chuckle)

193
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:19,592
Rich fucker.

194
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:23,095
Me, 40 years old,
maybe $40 in the bank

195
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,097
homeless, no kids.

196
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,600
Thank God for that.

197
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,605
Me, 20 years teaching
Shakespeare at Rutgers.

198
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,106
A lifer.

199
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:38,611
You think that Shakespeare
ever met a Puerto Rican?

200
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:39,612
Well, if he did

201
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,113
I could have been
in one of his plays.

202
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:44,116
Check this out.

203
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:47,119
Friends, Puerto Ricenos,
countrymen

204
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:50,623
lend me your ears
and hand me a beer.

205
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:54,627
I come to bury Miky,
not to praise him.

206
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:57,630
The evil that men do
lives after them.

207
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,131
The good is oft interred

208
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,633
with their bones.

209
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,135
So, let it be with Miky.

210
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,137
(laughing)

211
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,639
Check that out.

212
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:14,647
(coughs)

213
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:19,151
Damn.

214
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:20,152
You know, lately

215
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:23,656
I forget every wonderful thing
I want to remember.

216
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,157
(clears throat)

217
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:29,161
Things like... things
that happen when you're...

218
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:33,165
you're in a cab or...
at the doctor, or...

219
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:36,168
just walking
and watching.

220
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,671
Because that's all you
could afford emotionally.

221
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,173
And you say, "I'm going
to remember this

222
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,676
and place it where it fits."

223
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:49,181
But I don't know about you,
but I always forget them

224
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:50,182
you know?

225
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,184
(quiet laugh)

226
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,186
Man, look at this.

227
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:57,189
Look at Tito.

228
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,692
Nuyorican Poets!

229
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,195
Man, I will never forget
that night.

230
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:04,697
Of course not.

231
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,700
Because I told you
what happened.

232
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,202
I'm your memory.

233
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:16,208
I got a full house
and a baby waiting to be born.

234
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,710
(chuckling)

235
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,712
You told him how
important this was?

236
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:20,713
Of course I did

237
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,715
but that doesn't jive with him.

238
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,717
Put my neck on
the chopping block

239
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,719
to make this happen.

240
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,721
Joe, would you just
calm yourself down?

241
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,222
He's going to be here.

242
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:33,726
He-he's probably
just nervous, you know?

243
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:37,229
He's standing somewhere
watching us right now.

244
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,732
(smooth Latin music playing)

245
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,233
Hello.

246
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,235
My name is Joe Papp.

247
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,737
Good evening, ladies.

248
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:45,738
May we have your attention?

249
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,239
We're your tour guide.
We're with the city.

250
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,741
Check this out,
check this out!

251
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:49,742
Five, six,
seven, eight!

252
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:53,746
I met Miguel Pinero

253
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:56,248
shortly after his release
from Sing Sing...

254
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:57,249
Take off your shit!

255
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,751
What are you doing?

256
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:02,254
...where, for the past year,
he found the courage

257
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:05,257
to write and develop
a play calledShort Eyes

258
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:07,760
about the very place
where he was living.

259
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,762
Let go, let go, let go!

260
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,764
Go, go, go!Vaya!

261
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:16,268
All dramatists of real value

262
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:21,273
must sooner or later confront
what, for themselves, is...

263
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,275
truly dangerous.

264
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,779
Taxi.

265
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:34,787
Now we are proud to present
to you,Short Eyes.

266
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,293
Go. You do that
very well.

267
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:59,311
You know, this is
the best thing

268
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:00,813
that could happen to us.

269
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,815
I think so.

270
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:03,816
Really.

271
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,818
I mean, we are less now.

272
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:08,320
We'll eat more.

273
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,321
Hey...

274
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,323
we'll go to dancing

275
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:14,326
we will swim in
the Hudson River

276
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:18,330
we will read poetry,
we will go to movies...

277
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,833
(voice fades out,
haunting music fades in)

278
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:34,346
(no audio)

279
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,352
OFFICER:
Name?

280
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:41,353
Miguel Pinero.

281
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,357
What do you do
for a living?

282
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,860
I'm a writer, poet, reporter.

283
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,862
Really?

284
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,363
And a thief, a junkie

285
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,365
or whatever else one has to be
sometimes.

286
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:54,867
You know how it is.

287
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,869
OFFICER:
And you?

288
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,871
Tito. Tito Goya.

289
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,372
And you?

290
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,374
(laughs)

291
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:05,377
Hey, that's Goya
for the beans,
not the painter.

292
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,379
If it's Goya it's got
to be good,퓍u sabes?

293
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,384
Charley!

294
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:16,889
You owe me three packs, man!

295
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,891
Off the fucking noise!

296
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:22,394
Now, if I have to call
your name more than once, pray

297
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,396
'cause your soul
may belong to God

298
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,398
but your ass is mine.

299
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:29,401
Yeah, and your brain may belong
to the state

300
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:32,905
but your sanity belongs to me.

301
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:37,910
(no audio)

302
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,912
(can clanking)

303
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,919
Fuck.

304
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:54,426
Profe?

305
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:57,429
Professor? You around?

306
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:07,940
PINERO:
Hey,mira,brother man.

307
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,441
You want to buy a brand-new TV?

308
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:10,943
I just liberated it.

309
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:11,944
$35, all right?

310
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:12,945
I got medical bills.

311
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,446
I got to buy me
a new liver.

312
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,448
Tutu, you want
to buy a TV?

313
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,449
It's brand-new.

314
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,952
Shit, that thing
has a broken antenna.

315
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,954
Oh, no, look, Tutu--
it ain't broken.

316
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,956
It's just a short one,
so it don't get in the way

317
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:24,957
and shit like that, you dig?

318
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,461
We need one
for the bathroom anyway.

319
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:30,963
Hey, man,
that's cool.

320
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,464
That way you don't
miss out on the soap opera

321
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:33,966
when you're taking
a shit,퓍u sabes?

322
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,467
That's funny, man--
why don't you talk

323
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:36,969
that foul fucking
language somewhere else?

324
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,971
Yeah, like, be cool,
motherfucker.

325
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,487
(quietly):
The trouble with our love
is here.

326
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,990
Our love is around.

327
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,992
It's around...

328
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,994
Maybe the next time
you break in

329
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,996
I should
call the police.

330
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:07,499
Maybe.

331
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:12,504
Hi, I'm Sugar.

332
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,506
I'm Miky's woman.

333
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,508
I'm out here
hustling for Miky

334
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:21,013
trying to make a livin',
doing the best that I can

335
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,514
for my man.

336
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,018
Daddy hit me again.

337
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:30,022
Ma, can you hear me?

338
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:33,525
It's me, your baby.

339
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,028
He was drunk.

340
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,029
I know, I know--

341
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:39,031
he ain't my real dad.

342
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,033
But every time

343
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:45,037
you go to sleep,
he comes into my room

344
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,538
and he sits on my bed

345
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:50,042
and he starts touching my leg.

346
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:53,045
He scares me when
he's like that.

347
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:57,549
I know, I know--
the food, the landlord.

348
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:02,554
Where are you?

349
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:06,058
You said you'd be
around if I needed you

350
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:09,061
and I need you, Ma.

351
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:17,069
Ma, they call me Tricky now

352
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,072
'cause I've turned more tricks
in one night

353
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:23,075
than you turned in a lifetime.

354
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:32,584
Ma, please help me.

355
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:35,587
I'm tired of turning tricks.

356
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:38,090
I want a kick.

357
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,093
I want a fix.

358
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:46,098
I want you to need me.

359
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:49,101
I want you to need.

360
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:55,107
I want you to need me.

361
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:02,114
Cirrhosis.

362
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:06,118
Sounds like a fucking
flower, doesn't it?

363
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,124
I got to draw up a will.

364
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:15,127
So I figured, you know,
if we were married

365
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:18,630
you'd be the sole beneficiary
of my estate.

366
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,633
State of what?

367
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,635
State of mind?

368
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:28,140
You want to reward me
by making me a widow?

369
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,142
Believe it or not

370
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,143
there are some benefits

371
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:32,644
that come to you
by being married to me

372
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:33,645
that I want you to have

373
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:36,648
you know what I mean?

374
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:46,658
(siren wails in distance)

375
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:53,165
Do you think I like what I do?

376
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,667
It's acting.

377
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,669
You always said
I couldn't act.

378
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:59,171
Impossible.

379
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,173
You're impossible.

380
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:03,675
What am I going to do
with you, huh?

381
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,680
What are you talking about?

382
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:15,687
You know what I'm talking about.

383
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:19,691
What if something
happens to you?

384
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:22,694
I get scared too, Miky.

385
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:26,698
Look, I understand
if you don't want to marry me.

386
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,201
I mean, I wouldn't either.

387
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,736
"April 6, 1988.

388
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:07,239
You are hereby required
to blah, blah, blah..."

389
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,241
Shit.

390
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,244
Battery's dead, man.
What?

391
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:15,247
You left the fucking
radio on all night! Shit!

392
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,748
Dead battery?

393
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:17,749
What is this, an omen?

394
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,751
Miky, this ain't no omen.

395
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,253
This is my van, man.

396
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,755
Look, if you're going
to room with me, Miky

397
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,757
you got to respect
my space, man. Shit!

398
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,260
This motherfucker
ain't subsidized.

399
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,263
Probably won't even
pass inspection now

400
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,265
the way we going.

401
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:36,268
And neither will we.

402
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:37,769
PINERO:
How are you
going to have

403
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,271
Robert De Niro,
Ralph Macchio and Burt Young

404
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,772
playing Puerto Ricans
in a new play?

405
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:41,773
I don't want
to see that.

406
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:42,774
I don't want to see that.

407
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,276
I don't want you
around here.

408
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:45,777
Another Latino boom
is on the way

409
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,280
this time with Italians
playing us, bro.

410
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,281
Out! Get over here.

411
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,783
Come here.

412
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,285
This is a public
theater, right?

413
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,786
Yes, it is.

414
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:55,787
I thought this was
the Public Theater!

415
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:56,788
Itisthe Public Theater.

416
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,290
I'm part of the
public, you see.

417
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,291
I don't need
this shit, bro.

418
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,792
Don't be treating me
like that, man.

419
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:01,793
I see how it is.

420
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,295
If you got to see Ray,
you call him

421
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:04,796
but you do not come by,
you understand?

422
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,798
You let me down. You let me down
for the last time.

423
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:08,300
Oh, so what, now
you lost faith in me?

424
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,302
Of course not. I lost money.

425
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,805
Look, Joe, I'm sorry,
but I wrote this shit.

426
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:15,807
If you didn't like it,
that's not my problem.

427
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:16,808
You wrote the shit? No.

428
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,310
You wrote shit nothing.
Not a word.

429
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,812
You made me look bad.

430
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:23,815
I'm your last friend,
remember?

431
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,817
You said that.

432
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:29,821
Well, it be's that way
sometimes, bro.

433
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,323
Fuck you.

434
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:33,325
Fuck you, man.

435
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:36,828
Fuck you, fuck you, man!
Fuck you!

436
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,830
So what, now you got
Ray up in there

437
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,831
fulfilling your quota

438
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,333
for whore of the month
Latino life, huh?

439
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,835
I don't owe you shit.

440
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:45,837
I work for my commission,
motherfucker. Yeah.

441
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,343
What happened to you, Miguel?

442
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,345
Do you know?

443
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,846
Do you know?

444
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:59,851
Ray.

445
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,353
What's going on?

446
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,855
I love this man.

447
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:04,856
I know that.

448
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,360
(siren wails in distance)

449
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:16,368
It's okay, bro.

450
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:17,369
Don't worry about it.

451
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,870
Shit, nobody ever plays fair

452
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,873
when it comes
to the heart or the pocketbook.

453
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:22,874
I've been there.

454
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:26,378
No. No. No.
Yes. Yes. Yes.

455
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,880
RAY:
I love you, Miky...

456
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,383
but I got to agree with Papp,
you know?

457
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,385
De Niro's a box office draw.

458
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:36,388
I told Papp that I wanted you
to play my father

459
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:37,889
but you know how it is.

460
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:43,395
My man Bobby, he has clout.

461
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,896
He fell in love with the part.

462
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:46,898
Bobby?

463
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,900
Oh, yeah, Bobby.

464
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,902
You know I love you, Ray,
and all that shit, man

465
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:52,904
but sometimes you come across
like bad medicine

466
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,906
like a fucking laxative,
you know what I mean?

467
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:55,907
Hold me up.

468
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:57,909
Come on, hold me up.
Shit.

469
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:59,411
You are
very talented, Ray--

470
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:01,413
of course,
with my talent.

471
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:02,914
What the fuck's
this story about?

472
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:03,915
Whale-hunting,
offshore Korea.

473
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,917
Man, how you come up
with this foreign nonsense?

474
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,919
You've never seen
a fucking whale in your life

475
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,421
and you ain't no Korean.

476
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:10,422
You didn't have
to do that!

477
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,424
Well, you wanted me
to teach you, right?

478
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:14,426
Yeah, but not like this.

479
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:15,927
I'm not one
of your little boys

480
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:16,928
you just throw
in the water

481
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:17,929
and make me
learn how to swim.

482
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,931
Well, it be's that way
sometimes, bro.

483
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,433
You trying to fuck with me?

484
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:22,434
Fuck you, man.

485
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,436
Oh, so what,
now you're going

486
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,438
to hit me with
the chair? Come on.

487
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:27,439
You better hit me hard

488
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:28,940
because if you lay me out
and I get back up

489
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,442
I'm going to throw your ass
off this fucking roof.

490
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:31,943
Write about that.

491
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:33,445
You know, write
about what you
know, all right?

492
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:34,446
Write about that.

493
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:35,947
Write about your mother,
your father.

494
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,949
You got 20 stories
floating around

495
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:38,950
inside your stomach--
spit 'em out.

496
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,952
And how am I just supposed
to just "spit 'em out"

497
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:41,953
right?

498
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,455
Well, sweetie, I'm not going

499
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:46,458
to stick my finger down
your throat so you can puke.

500
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,460
And, by the way...

501
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,462
go buy yourself a
Smith Corona electric

502
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,464
'cause I can't
read your writing.

503
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,466
Take it.

504
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:57,969
Now, sit down,
smoke a joint.

505
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:00,972
So I gave you my ass.

506
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:03,975
What else you want,Papi?

507
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:06,978
Hmm? You want to grade
my fucking work?

508
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,481
Okay.

509
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:13,485
You're God.

510
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,487
Right...

511
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,489
Oh, man, what's going
on, because one day

512
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:20,992
you're happy, you know,
you're proud of me.

513
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:24,996
Now you're, uh, you know,
you're in a rage...

514
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:26,998
'causeI'mdoing good.

515
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:31,503
Excuse me.

516
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,004
I'm not me.

517
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,005
Excuse me.

518
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:35,507
Deadlines, man.
Come on.

519
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:38,009
Sentence passed, if
you catch my drift.

520
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,010
You look familiar.

521
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,512
Which one of you
are you today?

522
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,013
Actually, that's
why I came.

523
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,015
Come on. I got a
residual check
fromKojak.

524
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,517
They're running
the show in Africa.

525
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,018
I'm sorry, all right?

526
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:48,520
It was just a case of
nerves,Profe.Here.

527
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,022
Come on, it's not like I'm
going to be around forever.

528
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:52,023
You fucking
button-pushing

529
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:54,526
manipulating ingrate,
whose latest heartfelt con

530
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:57,028
is your death, because,
after all, you're the only

531
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:58,530
fucking person dying
in this world

532
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,031
because death
was designed

533
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,032
just for you, right?

534
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:02,534
(men yelling)

535
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,035
I don't want to die, Daddy!

536
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:06,538
Shit! I should take
that bouncing check

537
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:08,039
and welcome you back

538
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,041
to my home so that
in the eventuality

539
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,544
that I accidentally
shove a finger up your ass

540
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,546
you might squeeze
my mother's wedding band--

541
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,047
which I am wearing--
out of it, right?

542
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,550
Look, bandito, this
shit has to stop.

543
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,552
Anybody can be a poet
the way you live.

544
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,053
Fuck it!
I could write like you

545
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:23,555
if I didn't have to worry
about working

546
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:25,557
and sleeping or paying the rent.

547
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:26,558
I know, I know,Profe.

548
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:28,059
I know, and I'm sorry.

549
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:31,062
I do abuse you of your kindness
and humanity and shit.

550
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:32,564
Humanity.
That's the word, Miguel.
That's it.

551
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:34,065
Put that shit away.
Put that shit away.

552
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:36,067
PINERO:
I can't help it, you know.
You're a nice guy.

553
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:37,068
Look, I want to read to you...

554
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:38,570
Tito.

555
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,071
All right, let me read you
how I figured out

556
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:42,073
that last act forThe Sun
Always Shines for the Cool.

557
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:43,575
I heard it.
The whole building heard it.

558
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,076
The fucking neighborhood
heard it.

559
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:53,084
All right then.
I'll leave, you know.

560
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:54,085
I'll just leave.

561
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:57,088
Leave? Where the fuck
are you going to go

562
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,090
at 4:00 in the morning

563
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,592
where you won't
get arrested

564
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,594
for carrying around a
stolen-from-me Smith Corona?

565
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:16,608
I got an idea.

566
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:20,111
Now, I will rent this place

567
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:24,115
not for your benefit,
but for mine

568
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:27,118
so I can sleep,
so I can keep my job

569
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:31,623
so I can preserve my sanity
and write like you.

570
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,125
Welcome to our house!

571
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:37,128
The Nuyorican Poets Cafe.

572
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:38,630
Ha-ha!

573
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,131
What do you think, baby?

574
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:41,132
What do you think?

575
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:47,639
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

576
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:58,149
Miguel Algarin and Tito Goya
welcome Miguel Pinero

577
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:02,153
back from the filming of another
movie in Hollywood.

578
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:03,655
Vaya!

579
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,156
(combo playing Latin jazz)

580
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:16,167
(melancholy melody
fades in)

581
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:25,677
(melody continues)

582
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,683
(lively jazz playing)

583
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:38,189
Uh...

584
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:39,691
appreciate all the nice things

585
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,693
my friends can still say
about me, you dig?

586
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:44,195
But no speeches from me tonight,
uh...

587
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:46,698
I wrote this poem on the plane.

588
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:47,699
It goes, uh...

589
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:55,206
Dreamt I was a poet and writing
silver sailing songs.

590
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:56,708
Words strong and powerful

591
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:59,210
crashing through walls
of steel and concrete

592
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,713
erected in minds weak
and those asleep

593
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:05,216
replacing a hobby of paper
candy wrapping collecting potent

594
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:09,721
to pregnant sterile
young thoughts.

595
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:13,224
I dreamt I was thispoeta

596
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,226
words glittering bright and bold

597
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,228
striking a new rush
for gold inlas bodegas

598
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:20,732
where our poets' words
and songs are sung

599
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:23,234
but sunlight stealing
through venetian blinds

600
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:25,737
eyes hating, working of time

601
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:28,740
clock sweating and swearing
and slaving for the final dime

602
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,742
running a maze, a token ride.

603
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:33,244
Perspiration
insulting poets' pride

604
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:36,748
words stopping on red,
going on green...

605
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:39,250
poets dreams ending
in afactoria

606
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:43,755
as one-in-a-million unseen,
buying bodega sold dreams.

607
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:48,259
(applause and cheers)

608
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:56,267
WOMAN:
Miky! All right!

609
00:28:58,269 --> 00:28:59,270
Hey.

610
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,773
Remember me?

611
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:03,775
Maybe.

612
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,295
Excuse me.

613
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:25,797
Gee, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

614
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:32,804
What the fuck you give me--
elephant tranquilizer?

615
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,305
What day is it?

616
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:35,807
And do you have any more?

617
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:38,810
(laughing)

618
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,811
Shit.

619
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:42,313
Relax,Papi.

620
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:45,316
We've been
in this bed for hours.

621
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:46,818
What's the matter, huh?

622
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:48,820
Is it too hot
to get it up?

623
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,322
'Cause I can dig
a little tongue

624
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:53,825
but too much of
it makes me horny.

625
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:56,828
You can't be out here
giving up all this tongue

626
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,830
if you can't give
up anything else.

627
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,332
So... relax.

628
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:06,838
Shit, if I relax any more,
I'm going to faint.

629
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:10,842
So, what...
you rehearse that speech?

630
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,343
I did.

631
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:13,845
But you wrote it.

632
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:16,848
(mellow Latin jazz playing)

633
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:19,851
(laughing)

634
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:21,352
Yeah.

635
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:24,355
The Sun Always Shines
for the Cool.

636
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:26,357
Great play.

637
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:27,358
That's right.

638
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,360
So you want to be

639
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,361
an actress, huh?

640
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:33,364
Yeah. I've read
everything
you've written.

641
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:36,367
Twice.

642
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,869
I'm flattered.

643
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:39,370
So am I.

644
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:43,374
Twice, huh?

645
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:44,876
Yeah.

646
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:55,386
I guess it's true
what they say about jail.

647
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:57,388
What's with you?

648
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,891
Little boys?

649
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:06,898
Shit, I'd
like to watch.

650
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,906
Hey,Papi,
what's the matter?

651
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,908
Huh?

652
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:18,409
Oh, man, I was just kidding.

653
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,411
Look, why the fuck
you come here for, huh?

654
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:21,412
Between insulting me

655
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:23,915
and getting yourself
worked up to be near me

656
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:24,916
you lost me.

657
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,919
I thought that...

658
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:28,920
Oh, forget it.
Just get out of here.

659
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,921
Oh, come on, Miky.

660
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:31,422
Just get the fuck
out of here!

661
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:33,424
I'm sorry, okay?
Get out of here!

662
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:34,425
I'm just nervous.

663
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:38,930
I'm sorry, Miky.

664
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:43,935
I didn't mean it.

665
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:46,938
You know how long
I've been waiting for this?

666
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:52,944
You like me so much
it makes me nervous.

667
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:55,446
Since the first time
I saw you

668
00:31:55,446 --> 00:32:00,451
in the projects... and the rest
of how that shit goes

669
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:04,455
I knew you, Miky.

670
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,960
You had no father.

671
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,462
I had too much of one.

672
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,464
I said to myself...

673
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:15,466
"Between me and him...

674
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:16,968
we make one happy child."

675
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:17,969
Come on.

676
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:21,472
Everyone's a fucking
poet tonight, huh?

677
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,474
Maybe. And I'll
suck your cock

678
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:28,479
like a fucking poem,
whatever that makes me.

679
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,483
Whatever you want,
Miky, I'll do it.

680
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:33,985
I'm your whore.

681
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:37,488
(mellow jazz playing)

682
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:03,514
He comes into my room...

683
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:07,018
and he sits on my bed.

684
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,520
He scares me
when he's like that...

685
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,024
his hands touching me.

686
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:15,026
(groans)

687
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:20,031
All hard and
fast and hot

688
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:23,034
his spit falling
all over me...

689
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,035
MOTHER:
Miky!

690
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,036
Get out of here!

691
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:26,037
Get...! You get out...!

692
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:27,538
Get the fuck
out of here!

693
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:29,540
(door slam echoing)

694
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:33,544
The last time
you had a job

695
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:35,046
you were hired at
9:00 in the morning

696
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,547
by 11:00 you were fired.

697
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:38,549
That was two years ago.

698
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:41,052
So what,
are you a detective now?

699
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:42,553
Worse.

700
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:44,555
I'm your mother.

701
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:47,558
You just got out of jail,
now you're back inside.

702
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:49,060
Miky...

703
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,062
didn't you learn
anything good

704
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,064
the first time?

705
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:56,067
You mean besides acquiring
my first drug habit?

706
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,569
Don't talk to me
like that.

707
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,071
It's just that...

708
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:02,073
(sighs)

709
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:07,578
I am tired of visiting
my son behind bars.

710
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:11,582
It's the only time
we get to talk.

711
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:15,586
I mean, what happened
to that son I used to have?

712
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:18,589
The little boy who would
bring me flowers

713
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:22,093
who would write poems for me?

714
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:23,594
I think, in your mind

715
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:27,098
our life had been like
Leave it to Beaver.

716
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:31,602
But in my mind,
it was different.

717
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:34,105
I'm sorry.

718
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:37,108
You know, I'm sorry
for my anti-social behavior.

719
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:39,110
It's not a choice.

720
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,614
(exhaling)

721
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:49,620
What do you want me to do?

722
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:56,127
Make me proud before I go.

723
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:59,130
What, are you
in a hurry today?

724
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,133
No.

725
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:18,649
You're talking with your eyes.

726
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:23,654
(quietly):
Okay...

727
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:26,657
Okay, Mama.

728
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:28,159
I'll make you proud.

729
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,661
I'll make you proud of me,
you'll see.

730
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:32,663
You'll see.

731
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:34,665
I'll make you proud of me.

732
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:58,189
I got this picture
of Jane Fonda...

733
00:35:58,189 --> 00:35:59,690
so I would

734
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,193
really stretch out...

735
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:05,196
doing up my wood.

736
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:06,697
No, no, man,
say it natural.

737
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:08,699
Not like a minister.

738
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,701
Say it like you,
like here

739
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,703
like Edgar.

740
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,705
Don't try to sound
all like Corinthian

741
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:16,207
Ricardo Montalban Cordova dude.

742
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:17,708
Give me you, the life, Harlem.

743
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:20,211
Talk like you talk,
you know?

744
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:22,213
Be all the nigger that you are.

745
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,217
Did you say "nigger"?

746
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:32,223
Nigger.

747
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,236
Wesson oil

748
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:49,740
never had it so good.

749
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,242
You see, I got this picture

750
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:53,244
of Jane Fonda.

751
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:58,749
She got this black
silk satin bikini.

752
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:00,251
Yeah, you dig?

753
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:03,254
So I strips naked, right.

754
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:06,757
And I starts to roll and roll?

755
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:11,762
I mean, I am whipping my Johnson
Ronson to the bone, boy!

756
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:14,265
Ooh, yeah.

757
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:15,766
Soon...

758
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:20,771
everybody on the tier
knew that I was working out...

759
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,273
(laughing)

760
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:25,776
'cause soon,
everybody's voice was with me.

761
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:28,779
I starts... I starts
calling out her name

762
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,283
real soft, you know?

763
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,785
? Janey ?

764
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:37,788
(laughing)

765
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:42,293
? Janey, baby... ?

766
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,795
Oh, get it, Janey, oh!

767
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:49,300
Just a little louder, baby.
Ooh, faster.

768
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:53,804
I scream. Oh!
My knees buckle. Oh!

769
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:56,807
Oh, Janey, baby.
Get it, baby.

770
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:58,309
Get it.

771
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,811
Get it, get it, get
it, get it, get it.

772
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,313
Oh, Janey!

773
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:05,816
(sighing):
Oh... ooh...

774
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:08,819
(sighing):
Ah...

775
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,321
(chuckles)

776
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:13,824
Now that's black power.

777
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:14,825
That's it!

778
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:16,327
That's how we do it!

779
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:17,828
Now you're an actor.

780
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:21,832
You ain't Bowser anymore--
44-756 armed robbery rap.

781
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:23,334
No, man, not
while you're acting.

782
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:27,838
You Ice, leading man
inShort Eyes.

783
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:31,842
(Latin-flavored rhythms
playing, vocalist improvising)

784
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:50,861
PINERO:
Well, when you're in prison,
you're nowhere being nobody.

785
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:52,363
You're a number, you know?

786
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,865
So when I started writing
my poetry and acting

787
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:56,867
I felt like somebody
in the land of nothing.

788
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:59,870
I never felt so alive.
I never had so much energy.

789
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,872
I go back to my cell,
I'd create something.

790
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:06,877
(Latin rhythms continue)

791
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:08,879
I spoke to this movie
director this afternoon

792
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:11,882
who's very much interested in
making a film ofShort Eyes.

793
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:15,386
I mean, there's Lumet,
there's Pacino...

794
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:17,388
and, I mean, basically
everybody in this town

795
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:18,389
they love you.

796
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:21,892
And I can get you
the best possible deal.

797
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:23,394
Uh, Rob?

798
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,395
Yes?

799
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:25,896
Rob, is it?
Yeah.

800
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:28,399
So you want to be my pimp?

801
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,401
Is that it, you want
to pimp me out?

802
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,403
Yes.

803
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:33,904
Yes, very much so.

804
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:35,906
I would love that.

805
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:38,909
REPORTER:
Well, you must be feeling

806
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:41,412
really good tonight,
Mr. Pinero.

807
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,914
Your play,Short Eyes,
created a lot of controversy

808
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:44,915
a lot of opposition

809
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:47,418
and still you won
six nominations.

810
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,420
It's the first time
a Puerto Rican playwright

811
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,421
cleans up at the Tonys.

812
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:51,422
Cleans up?

813
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:52,923
At the Tonys, yes,
but, you know

814
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:54,925
we have been cleaning up
and down in this town

815
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:57,428
since theMarine Tigerdocked,
you know, in your offices

816
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:59,930
your restaurants,
the fine hotels.

817
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,433
Later on, we were cleaned up
in Korea, then Vietnam.

818
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:03,934
But when it came to the writing

819
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:07,438
we'd go chisel the motherfucker
straight out of beer cans--

820
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,440
the tar, the concrete of the
city-- the roots of the city.

821
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,942
You know, the metaphors
will flow from there.

822
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:14,445
But-- check it out--
no windows tonight.

823
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:16,447
This is our time.

824
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:19,950
(music and vocals continue)

825
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:23,954
It's not like we go into
the homes of the rich

826
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:25,956
and we walk out with
the silver ashtray, no.

827
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:27,958
We got in and we walk out
with something better--

828
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:29,960
their attention.

829
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,962
We take them to a world
they used to fear.

830
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:33,964
And we tell them,
hey, it's cool.

831
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:36,467
We used to fear you, too, man.

832
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:40,971
(trumpet playing
melancholy jazz solo)

833
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:04,995
(laughing)

834
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:06,997
This is our time.

835
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,503
(quietly):
Yeah.

836
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:15,506
Hey, check this out.

837
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:18,509
I know this is going
to be kind of sappy
and out of character

838
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:21,011
but with you,
I can be sappy and
out of character.

839
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,012
Yeah, right.

840
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:24,014
You must think of me
like some kind of

841
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:27,017
senile grandmother
or something.

842
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:31,021
But you got a promise
me one thing,Profe...

843
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:33,524
that, by tomorrow night

844
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:36,527
you'll come back to me with
a poem that lays out in detail

845
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:41,031
what's to be done
in case you or I die.

846
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:44,535
Excuse me?

847
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,036
Nothing's wrong.

848
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:48,539
You know, it's just a pact
here-- you know, a promise--

849
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:50,541
in case we caught
with our pants down.

850
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:53,043
Just humor me.

851
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:55,045
You want me to write a poem

852
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:59,550
about the details
of our funerals?

853
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:03,053
Yeah.

854
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:06,557
Yeah, so you write what you
want, I'll write what I want--

855
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:09,059
you know, like a testament--

856
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:15,065
and, uh, whoever goes first--
God forbid, it's you or me--

857
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:17,067
got to do what the poem says.

858
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:19,570
You're not planning
anything funny?

859
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:22,072
Algarin... what?

860
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:24,074
Now that we got the city
by the balls?

861
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:25,075
Watch out.

862
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:30,581
? Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey ?

863
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:33,083
?Mete la mano
en el bolsillo?

864
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:35,085
?Saca ya tu cuchillo
y ten cuidado?

865
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:36,086
? Oh, yeah,ten cuidado?

866
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:40,591
?Pongame o?do en
este barrio loco lo mataron?

867
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:42,092
?Y que mucho lo han matado?

868
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:43,594
?Calle luna, calle sol?

869
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:44,595
?A donde?

870
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:46,597
?Calle luna, calle sol...?

871
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:49,099
I'm here.

872
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,100
BODEGA MAN:
Miky.

873
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,603
You needed $5,000,
I got you $5,000.

874
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:54,605
Ain't nobody going
to shut you down.

875
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:58,108
Look, it's only money.

876
00:42:58,108 --> 00:43:00,110
As legit as Hollywood
money can be

877
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,612
but... you pay
me back, cool.

878
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,614
If you can't pay
me back, no problem.

879
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:05,115
Okay?Vaya.

880
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,621
I look at it this way.

881
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:11,622
You know, I come in tomorrow

882
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,123
if I'm broke, you
give me a six-pack

883
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:14,625
we call it even, okay?

884
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:17,628
He was dead.

885
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:19,129
He never lived. He died.

886
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:20,631
Died.

887
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:22,633
He died seekin' the cause.

888
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:24,635
Because he said
he never saw the cause

889
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:25,636
but he heard the cause.

890
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:28,138
Heard the crying
of hungry ghetto children.

891
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:30,140
Heard the warning from Malcolm.

892
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,643
Heard the tractors
pave new routes to new prisons.

893
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:35,646
He died seekin' a cause,
seekin'acause.

894
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,648
He was already dead.

895
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:39,650
He never really lived.

896
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:42,152
Uptown, downtown, crosstown

897
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:45,656
his body was found
all over town seekin' the cause.

898
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:48,659
Thinking the cause
was $75 and gator shoes.

899
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:50,661
Thinking the cause
was selling the white lady

900
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:52,162
to black children.

901
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:55,666
Thinking the cause was to
be found in Gypsy Rose or J.B.

902
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:59,169
or singing doo-wops in the park
after some chiba-chiba.

903
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:01,672
(humming doo-wop)

904
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:06,677
He died.

905
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:08,679
He died seekin' the cause.

906
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:10,180
And the cause
was dying seekin' him.

907
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:12,182
And the cause was dying
seekin' him.

908
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:14,184
And the cause was dying
seekin' him.

909
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:15,686
He wanted a color TV.

910
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:17,688
He wanted a silk-on-silk suit.

911
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:19,690
He wanted the cause
to come up like the Mets

912
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:20,691
and take the World Series.

913
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:23,694
He wanted, he wanted,
he wanted, he wanted.

914
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:24,695
He wanted to want more wants

915
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:26,196
but he never gave,
he never gave.

916
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:27,197
He never gave.

917
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:29,700
He never gave his love
to his children.

918
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,202
He never gave
his heart to his people

919
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:36,707
and never did he ever
give his soul to his people.

920
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:38,709
He never gave his soul
to his people

921
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,711
because he was busy
seekin' a cause.

922
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:43,213
Busy...
busy perfecting his voice

923
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:45,215
to harmonize the national anthem

924
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:46,216
with Spiro T. Agnew.

925
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:48,218
Busy perfecting his jive talk

926
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:50,220
so that his flunkiness
wouldn't show.

927
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:54,725
Busy perfecting his
viva la policiaspeech.

928
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:59,229
Downtown, uptown, midtown,
crosstown.

929
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:02,232
His body was found
all over town.

930
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:05,235
Found in the part of fields
of an O.D.

931
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:07,237
Find in the bowery
with the DDTs.

932
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:09,740
His legs were left in Vietnam.

933
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,742
His arms
were found in Sing Sing.

934
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:13,243
His scalp was on Nixon's belt.

935
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:15,746
His blood painted the streets
of the ghetto.

936
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:18,248
His eyes were still looking
for Jesus

937
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:21,752
to come down on some cloud
and make everything okay.

938
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:24,755
When Jesus died in Attica

939
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:28,258
his brains plastered all around
the frames of the Pentagon

940
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:31,762
his voice still yelling
"Stars and stripes forever"

941
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:34,264
riddled with the police bullets
his taxes bought.

942
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:35,766
He died seekin' a cause.

943
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:39,269
Died seekin'acause.

944
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:40,270
He died yesterday.

945
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:43,273
He's dying today.
He's dead tomorrow.

946
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:44,274
He died seekin' a cause

947
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:46,276
and the cause
was in front of him.

948
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:47,778
And the cause was in his speech.

949
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:48,779
And the cause was in his skin.

950
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:50,280
And the cause was in his blood.

951
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:51,782
But he died.

952
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:53,283
He died seekin' a cause.

953
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:55,285
Seekin'acause.

954
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:56,787
He died deaf, dumb and blind.

955
00:45:56,787 --> 00:46:00,791
He died and never found
his cause, because, you see

956
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:04,294
he never, never knew
that he was the cause.

957
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:08,799
(hums doo-wop phrase
in falsetto voice)

958
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:11,802
(Brazilian samba music
continues playing)

959
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:34,324
(samba music continues)

960
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:09,860
What's happening?

961
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:12,863
What's the matter with you, man?

962
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:13,864
Oh, just a little
oppression

963
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:16,366
on the right side
of the rib cage.

964
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:17,868
It's called an
exploding liver.

965
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:20,370
Kind of like a
standing ovation

966
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:23,373
organs give to
graduating chemicals.

967
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:24,374
What you want, man?

968
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:26,877
A liver. I need a liver.

969
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:27,878
A lover?

970
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:28,879
A liver.

971
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:31,882
I need a fucking
liver, bro.

972
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:35,886
Look, man, I can get
you crack, smack, weed...

973
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,387
but no liver, bro.

974
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:39,890
You fucking with me, or what?

975
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:41,391
I'm sick.

976
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:42,392
I need a liver.

977
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:44,394
I got to find someone
who's got a liver

978
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:45,395
compatible with mines.

979
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:46,396
You mean that fits?

980
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:47,898
Look, bro, I need
cash or a liver

981
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:49,399
or something
for real, brother.

982
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:53,904
I heard of some dude
who got this kidney for Jackie

983
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:55,405
this singer uptown.

984
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:57,908
He used to be with the O'Jays.

985
00:47:57,908 --> 00:47:59,409
But a liver?

986
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:03,413
Look, just don't talk
that liver shit

987
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:05,415
around this chick.

988
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:07,417
(knock on window)

989
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:08,919
I sold you as someone creative.

990
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:11,922
Remember...

991
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:14,925
ten percent for me,
whatever you write.

992
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:16,426
This the chick?

993
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:17,928
That's the one.

994
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:20,430
I'd like to introduce you all

995
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:24,935
to a personality we have
in the house tonight with us.

996
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:26,436
Noel Pinero.

997
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:28,438
Where are you, baby?

998
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:29,439
Aye. There you go.

999
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,942
Look at that famous,
fabulous face.

1000
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:33,443
Show time, baby.

1001
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:34,945
(lively electronic
music plays)

1002
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:39,449
? I am the first girl
on the moon ?

1003
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:42,452
? Look... at me float ?

1004
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:44,955
? I am a fire girl ?

1005
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:48,458
? Give it to me, baby ?

1006
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:50,961
? Oh... oh... oh... ?

1007
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:52,963
? Look at me now. ?

1008
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:55,966
I do fashion, you know.

1009
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:59,469
With your connections
and my looks

1010
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:01,471
God knows.

1011
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:06,977
Jake says you're famous.

1012
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:09,980
What are you
famous for, honey?

1013
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,982
Tell Cuqui.

1014
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:14,985
Tell Cuqui.

1015
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:15,986
Wait a minute.

1016
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:19,489
You... you want me
to write you a play?

1017
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:23,493
Yes. You like to,Papi?

1018
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:30,500
I think I'd like something...

1019
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,003
fun...

1020
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:35,005
with humanity...

1021
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:36,506
and sexy.

1022
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:39,509
Yeah. I like that.

1023
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:41,511
I like that.

1024
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:46,516
Mira,Mommy, writing
is like half inspiration

1025
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:47,517
half inhalation.

1026
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:49,019
What?!

1027
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:50,020
풲u sabes?

1028
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,022
(sniffing)

1029
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:58,028
Now, for a writer
like my stature

1030
00:49:58,028 --> 00:50:00,530
to collaborate with an actress
of your caliber

1031
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:03,533
there has to be
a bond,퓍u sabes?

1032
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:09,539
What blood type are you?

1033
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:13,543
Blood type?

1034
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:16,546
Are you a vampire,Papi?

1035
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:19,049
Yeah.

1036
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:22,052
(snorting)

1037
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:27,557
That's money.

1038
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:29,059
You're throwing away
money, baby.

1039
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:31,561
I want some, too.

1040
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:35,565
Look, I think you
better go, Noel.

1041
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:37,067
Just go
before something...

1042
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:40,070
Before, before, before what?
Before what?

1043
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,571
You asked me up here.

1044
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:43,073
Shit, you ain't even
got my name right

1045
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:44,574
and you at the end
of the chapter.

1046
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:47,077
You know what I should do?
You know what I should do?

1047
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:49,579
Yeah. Go on.

1048
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:52,082
Hit me.

1049
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:53,583
Hit me.

1050
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:54,584
Go for it, baby.

1051
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:56,586
I know that's
what you want.

1052
00:50:56,586 --> 00:50:59,589
'Cause you have been
this and that.

1053
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:02,592
Well, let's face the facts,
honey.

1054
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:04,094
You are a loser.

1055
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:05,595
And the only thing

1056
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:07,597
that you're leaving with
here tonight

1057
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:11,101
is the satisfaction of having
physically beat a woman.

1058
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:12,102
Listen to me, woman.

1059
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:13,603
You know what I'm going to do?

1060
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:15,605
You know what you can do for me?
Do you?

1061
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:17,107
Do you?

1062
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:19,109
Do you know?

1063
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:21,111
I'm going to take your liver.

1064
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:23,113
Yeah.

1065
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:24,614
That's right.

1066
00:51:24,614 --> 00:51:26,616
I'm going to come to you
at night

1067
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:27,617
when you're sleeping.

1068
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:29,619
I'm going to cut your
fucking liver out.

1069
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:31,621
That's what I'm going
to write about.

1070
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:33,623
That's what
I'm going to write about.

1071
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:37,127
I'm going to take
your fucking liver, yeah.

1072
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:39,129
Get the fuck
out of here!

1073
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:42,132
Get out before I call
the police, you fucking freak.

1074
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:44,634
They'll get here so fast
you won't even make it

1075
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:46,636
to the lobby, eh?

1076
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:54,144
Let's see who's the man.

1077
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:57,147
Come on, you son of a bitch!
I'll slice you, motherfucker.

1078
00:51:57,147 --> 00:51:59,149
(chuckling)

1079
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:05,155
Beautiful.

1080
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,293
Okay, fine, I've
burned every bridge

1081
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,795
and I can't fucking
walk my way back

1082
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,797
to the Writer's Guild
Pension and fuckfare

1083
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,298
but it don't mean
I got to go

1084
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,300
like I was never around.

1085
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,802
It's not going
to happen, Miky.

1086
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,303
I live, you live.

1087
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:24,307
I don't even know
who owns what, right?

1088
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:27,811
I mean, I try to call my agent
and he's, like

1089
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,313
he fucking died before me.

1090
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,816
I thought you were
leaving it all to Sugar.

1091
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:34,818
Or the IRS--
motherfuckers.

1092
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,821
They come and get you
between the fucking flames

1093
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,823
with an asbestos suit
and a hose.

1094
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,326
MAN:
This country has never made me
so blue

1095
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,828
that I want to be red

1096
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:47,330
so don't call me a Puerto Rican.

1097
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,331
I'm an American.

1098
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:49,833
Oh, God, no.
What is it?

1099
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,835
What is that? What is this?

1100
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,838
Excuse me?

1101
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,841
The fight...
I don't think you've developed

1102
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,343
any real conflict
or anything, you know?

1103
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:04,848
I'm sorry.

1104
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:08,852
Uh, who the fuck are you?

1105
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:14,357
I just came to the workshop
because I like your work.

1106
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,359
I'm your fan, man.
That's who the fuck I am.

1107
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,360
My fan?

1108
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,862
(actor snickering)

1109
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,864
And I want
to be a writer

1110
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:21,865
and I'm right.

1111
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:22,866
That's right.

1112
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:25,368
If you could only
give yourself a second

1113
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:26,369
to maybe think you're wrong

1114
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:29,372
and even if you don't,
I'm still right.

1115
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:32,876
My name is Reinaldo Povad.

1116
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:36,880
Kind of odd, sounds like... God.

1117
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,884
(dance music playing)

1118
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,888
PINERO:
That's why I gave up
the mugging business, right?

1119
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:46,890
All these dumb movies
about men and women

1120
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:48,892
taking the law
into their own hands.

1121
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,394
I mean, it gets to be
you pull a knife on someone

1122
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,396
everyone, you know, they've been
taking up karate-this

1123
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,398
and kung-fu-that lessons.

1124
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:58,401
Dude starts to think he's like
Bruce Lee's second cousin.

1125
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,904
You got to stab him
in self-defense, right?

1126
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:05,408
Povad-- what kind
of Puerto Rican name is that?

1127
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,910
Russian.

1128
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,412
My grandmother.

1129
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,416
What do you think
of the girl?

1130
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:15,418
She turning you on?

1131
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,420
Not my type.

1132
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:27,931
She's my mother.

1133
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,935
No joke, man.

1134
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,938
? We got to get over the hump ?

1135
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:37,440
? We got get over the hump,
right now... ?

1136
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,945
Nice tits, huh?

1137
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:47,951
Beautiful tits.

1138
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,455
? Turn me loose... ?

1139
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,958
(fusion music playing)

1140
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:07,470
So I busted the key
in the door

1141
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,473
and I stepped
into Blackie's dog shit

1142
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:13,977
and I wiped it off
with Junior's baby diaper

1143
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,980
and that was full of baby shit.

1144
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,481
So while relaxing,
I told Gloria

1145
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,483
of all the shit
I had been through

1146
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:23,987
and she said that
I was full of shit.

1147
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,990
I said I wasn't bullshitting.

1148
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,992
She said I wasn't shit.

1149
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:32,996
I said that I don't want
to hear no shit.

1150
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:35,498
She said I still wasn't shit.

1151
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:38,001
So I grabbed her
by the fucking neck

1152
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:41,004
and I pulled her ass
across the kitchen table

1153
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:44,007
and she went flying
across the living room table

1154
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:49,012
and over the underpaid,
overpriced furniture

1155
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:52,515
and landed on
the overworked bed.

1156
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,017
And I jumped into the air

1157
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,518
and with the scream

1158
00:55:55,518 --> 00:56:00,523
of an Apache warrior's cry
of battle, I kill, kill, killed

1159
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,525
all my troubles away.

1160
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,043
(fusion music continues)

1161
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:39,562
?  ?

1162
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:54,077
(laughs)

1163
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,079
How was that?
Was that good?

1164
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,581
That felt real.
That felt real.

1165
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,083
Hey, what are you
doing tonight, anyway?

1166
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,084
Why don't you come on up?

1167
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:04,087
Maybe you'll get lucky
and I'll fall in love with you.

1168
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,594
Hey, here's
your call sheet.

1169
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,598
Sure you don't want
to come up?

1170
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:18,101
I'm positive.
Good night, Miky.

1171
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,603
And don't forget
your wardrobe.

1172
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,607
Miguel.

1173
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:25,608
Papi?

1174
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,610
Man, so good
to see you.

1175
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,613
But what took you
so fucking long

1176
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,115
to come back here?

1177
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:35,618
I wanted...
I wanted to tell you...

1178
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:37,620
What's it been,
like, 16 years?

1179
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,629
You got a nice place here.

1180
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:55,138
I'm glad you've done
so well for yourself.

1181
00:57:55,138 --> 00:58:01,644
When... your mother
and I split up...

1182
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,646
You mean when you left
my mother

1183
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:06,149
to take care of five kids
all by herself?

1184
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,654
Huh?

1185
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,161
Yeah.

1186
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:22,165
You know, I had this dream
that someday

1187
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:25,168
you and she would take five
off your daily fights

1188
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:30,173
and offer me a sign of peace.

1189
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:34,677
Yeah, I had that wonderful dream
so many times it...

1190
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,179
it became like a fucking rerun.

1191
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:43,686
It isn't easy...

1192
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:44,687
Drop it already.

1193
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,190
Just stop the
concerned father
role, all right?

1194
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,691
It doesn't fit you well.

1195
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:51,194
It makes me want to throw up
all over this place.

1196
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,695
Just cut it loose,
will you?

1197
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,201
I like being on my own.

1198
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:27,730
(door opens and shuts)

1199
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,732
Yeah.

1200
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:40,243
Hey, Dad,
thanks for coming by, okay?

1201
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:42,245
I love you, Dad.

1202
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:43,746
Give me a kiss,Papi.

1203
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:47,250
I miss you.

1204
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,253
Hey, don't be a stranger, man.

1205
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,255
I'll see you again.

1206
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,262
What can I get you?

1207
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,264
Some questions answered.

1208
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,765
Like what?

1209
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:05,268
Like this man says he's
your father. Is that true?

1210
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,270
Well, he's the man
that fucked my mother

1211
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,772
and created a child he named...

1212
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:11,274
Forget it.

1213
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:15,278
Yeah, if that's being a father,
I guess he's my father.

1214
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,780
And it means nothing
to me at all.

1215
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:25,288
We're here, so let's make
the best of it, okay?

1216
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:26,789
Don't worry about it.

1217
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,791
We'll find
a better place.

1218
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,793
It's going to be fun,
I promise you.

1219
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,797
(music playing in distance)

1220
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:51,314
?Desde el cielo he recibido
la noticia?

1221
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:54,817
?Que un angel se ha escapado
sin querer?

1222
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:59,822
?Esta andando preferido
por la tierra?

1223
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:02,825
?Lo que tiene
es que se viste de mujer?

1224
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:06,829
?Yo sospecho una criatura
que yo he visto?

1225
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,831
?Porque cada vez...?

1226
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,834
What's happening, John?

1227
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,341
What?

1228
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:20,343
It's about your mother, man.

1229
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:23,846
Your sister called.

1230
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:24,847
I'm sorry, man.

1231
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:57,380
(melancholy music playing)

1232
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:08,391
MOTHER:
This poem was written

1233
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:13,896
by a great Puerto Rican,
greatpoeta.

1234
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:26,909
(laughs)

1235
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:31,414
That's good, huh?

1236
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:34,417
See? We don't have to be waiters
or doormen.

1237
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:36,919
And Miguelito,
you are the oldest

1238
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:38,921
and you should know that

1239
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:40,423
just because we are here

1240
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:43,926
doesn't mean we don't have to
forget what we left there.

1241
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:48,931
PINERO:
I've never seen
a palm tree in my life!

1242
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:50,933
I told you guys
we'd get back home one day.

1243
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:57,940
?...es la tierra pura
y de gracia...?

1244
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,442
Puerto Rico!

1245
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:00,943
(all laughing)

1246
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:03,446
?...y pueblos hechiceros?

1247
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,448
? Puerto Rico. ?

1248
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,460
And the island is left
unattended

1249
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,963
because the middle-class
bureaucratic Cuban has arrived

1250
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:24,967
spitting blue-eyed justice
at brown-skinned boy

1251
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:28,971
in military khaki.

1252
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:31,474
Compromise to survive.

1253
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:32,975
His hairline-length,
mustached-trimmed face

1254
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:34,477
looking grim
like a soldier on furlough

1255
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:41,484
further cannot exhibit contempt
for what is not cacique-born.

1256
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,986
Man, I've been waiting for
this day all my life!

1257
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:45,988
(clapping rhythm)

1258
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:48,491
This poem

1259
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:51,994
will receive a burning,
stomach-turning scorn.

1260
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:54,497
Nullified...

1261
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,499
classified...

1262
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:58,000
racist...

1263
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,504
from this Pan Am Eastern

1264
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:03,506
First National

1265
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:06,509
Chase Manhattan Puerto Rico.

1266
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,011
(sparse laughter and applause)

1267
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:20,523
It's kind of quiet in here.

1268
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:22,024
Reminds me of the time

1269
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:24,026
I auditioned for
the parole board at Sing Sing.

1270
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:26,028
(microphone feedback squeals)

1271
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:27,530
Well, excuse me

1272
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:31,534
but I'm not sure that
you know about

1273
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:34,537
our internal problems here.

1274
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:37,540
I mean, what is it that you feel
for Puerto Rico

1275
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:42,545
besides an
obvious affection

1276
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:45,548
and some kind of nostalgic
notion of what we really are

1277
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:48,551
besides rum,
and music

1278
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,553
and dominoes
on the sidewalk

1279
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:53,055
and God knows
what else you need

1280
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:57,059
to feed this anger.

1281
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,562
You don't know?

1282
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:02,565
Listen...

1283
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,066
even if well-intentioned

1284
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:07,069
it is still out of place
when it comes from a character

1285
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:09,071
that corrupts
the language

1286
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:11,073
when you are
calling yourselves

1287
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:13,075
"Nuyoricans"

1288
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:14,577
as if it was a race?

1289
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,579
Check this out.

1290
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:19,081
I was born here in the
town of Gurabo, in 1948.

1291
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:21,083
Lived on this island
till the age of seven.

1292
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,586
My family decided to move
to New York--

1293
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:25,588
not a trip that I planned
nor wanted.

1294
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:27,089
I am Puerto Rican.

1295
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:28,591
Now, I subnamed myself with

1296
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:31,093
a reality-given motherfucking
slang of a title--

1297
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:32,595
in this case "Nuyorican"--

1298
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:36,098
and wherever I go,
I am Puerto Rican

1299
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:39,101
and Rican, and Nuyorican
24 hours a day.

1300
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:40,102
Now, if you are embarrassed

1301
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:42,104
or afraid of what you are,
don't blame me.

1302
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:43,606
It's not my fault.

1303
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:46,108
Blame that fucking Oxford shirt
you're wearing from

1304
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:48,110
whatever prison you live in
that forces you to wear it

1305
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:49,612
to fake something that
you are not

1306
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:53,616
to be something that
you are not.

1307
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:56,118
See, 'cause even if I am
half-and-half

1308
01:05:56,118 --> 01:06:00,122
any of those halves
is more whole than all of you.

1309
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:02,625
I know what I am

1310
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:05,628
and I know when it hurts
and I'm still the same man.

1311
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:10,633
The same Puerto Rican,
24 hours a day.

1312
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,134
But thank you.

1313
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:14,136
Thank you for your comments.

1314
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:15,137
Does anyone else have

1315
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:19,141
any comments, questions,
literary criticism?

1316
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:21,143
Don't be afraid. Speak up.

1317
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:23,145
This is a free country,
I think.

1318
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:26,148
(scattered applause)

1319
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:40,162
Hey, man, you came here
looking for a piece of ass

1320
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:44,166
and you find your own daughter
selling her pussy.

1321
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:48,170
Maybe you should, you know,
keep it in the family.

1322
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:53,175
An invited trick
and a ho staring
at each other

1323
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:56,679
and they turn out
to be family.

1324
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:59,181
Daddy's going to pay to fuck
his little girl.

1325
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:01,684
Man!

1326
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:03,185
I must have woke up

1327
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:05,187
on the wrong side of the bed
this morning

1328
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:07,189
'cause nothing's
gone right at all.

1329
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:08,691
Everybody gone.

1330
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:15,698
All the smokes smoked,
the liquor gone.

1331
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:18,701
Nothing left but some warm beer.

1332
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,703
That's what I got

1333
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,204
to leave behind in my will.

1334
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:23,706
My great estate.

1335
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:27,710
Can you hear me?

1336
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:31,213
You know what?

1337
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:33,215
I guess today

1338
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,717
just ain't my day.

1339
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:35,718
Guess not.

1340
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:37,219
Police! Freeze! Nobody move!

1341
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:40,723
(loud, frantic Latin music
playing)

1342
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:42,725
(all yelling)

1343
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,742
Come on, let's go!

1344
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:01,243
She doesn't have
to come with us.

1345
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:03,746
Of course she does, man!

1346
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:08,250
(frantic screaming)

1347
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:09,752
WOMAN:
No, no, no!

1348
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:14,256
No... no!

1349
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:15,758
Tito, now what the
fuck are you doing?

1350
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:16,759
Stay the fuck away!

1351
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,761
Don't fuck with me, Miky!

1352
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:20,262
Stay the fuck away!

1353
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:21,764
(baby crying)

1354
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:22,765
This is fucked.

1355
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:25,267
This is fucked!

1356
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:38,280
(woman sobbing)

1357
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,282
So, thanks for
the ride, you know?

1358
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,785
It's been fun.

1359
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:44,787
Miky, I...

1360
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:49,291
No, no.

1361
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,794
Save it for your wedding.

1362
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:55,798
Miky...

1363
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:06,308
(coughing)

1364
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:24,326
What you writing now?

1365
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:28,831
The final chapter of my life.

1366
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:31,333
It seems I'm writing it
myself alone.

1367
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:40,342
"Even if nothing
was happening in my world

1368
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:44,346
"life was there--

1369
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:47,850
"perhaps poorly
represented

1370
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:51,854
but it was there."

1371
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:01,363
Do me one favor.

1372
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:06,869
Don't take me
to the hospital, please.

1373
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:11,874
No, brother man, no.

1374
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:14,877
Doctor's in the house.

1375
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:16,378
Stand up.

1376
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:19,381
Let's get you
settled inside, okay?

1377
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:21,383
There you go.

1378
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:22,885
Go ahead and lie back.

1379
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:24,386
Put your feet up.

1380
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:25,888
(coughing)

1381
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,890
Oh, yeah.

1382
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,892
All right.

1383
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:37,900
It's nice in here,
isn't it?

1384
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,902
Yeah, it's pretty good.

1385
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:42,404
Except for
the bunk beds
and the sink

1386
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:44,907
it's kind of like
right back where
we started.

1387
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,408
Yeah.

1388
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:47,910
(laughter)

1389
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:50,412
(coughing)

1390
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:53,415
Doctor's orders: got
some medicine for you.

1391
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:55,918
(sniffing)

1392
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:56,919
Ah...

1393
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:58,420
That's good.

1394
01:10:58,420 --> 01:10:59,922
(groans)

1395
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:03,425
One more, just
to be safe, huh?

1396
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:04,927
(sniffing)

1397
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:06,929
There you go.

1398
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:09,932
In fact, you know what?

1399
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,935
I'm going to take one
for myself, too.

1400
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,937
(chuckling)

1401
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:17,439
Can't party alone.

1402
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:26,949
MAN:
Next on line, please.

1403
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:28,951
Yeah, what a night, huh?

1404
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:31,453
Two for Miguel Pinero.

1405
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:32,955
Who?

1406
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:35,958
Miguel Pinero.
Two free.

1407
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,961
Pinero?

1408
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,963
Can I see some I.D., please?

1409
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:43,465
Identification.

1410
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:44,967
Uh, yeah, sure,
but you know what?

1411
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:47,970
I think this counter's a little
too high for my dick to reach.

1412
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,972
You might have to look down,
you fucking faggot.

1413
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:52,474
Security.

1414
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:55,477
Security, please.

1415
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:57,479
Unruly.

1416
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:58,981
What's happening, John?

1417
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,988
Thank you very much.
Enjoy the show.

1418
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:07,489
Fuck you very much.

1419
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:08,991
Next, please.

1420
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:10,993
I'm talking about
the deal of the century.

1421
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:12,494
Deal of the century.

1422
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:14,496
$100 for the pair.

1423
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:16,999
Big, big opening night tonight,
ladies and gentlemen.

1424
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:19,501
Cuba and his Teddy Bear.

1425
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:21,003
I swear, it's
Cuba and his Teddy Bear.

1426
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,504
How about you, brother?

1427
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:23,505
No, thanks.

1428
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:24,506
You got your tickets?

1429
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:26,008
All right, be cool, be cool.

1430
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,511
Good evening.

1431
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:33,015
My name is Joseph Papp.

1432
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,516
(applause)

1433
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:42,524
Our playwright tonight
belongs to a tradition

1434
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:46,028
a tradition of artists,
whose devious

1435
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:47,529
and renegade lives

1436
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:52,534
paradoxically result...

1437
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:55,037
in the most painstaking

1438
01:12:55,037 --> 01:13:00,042
devotion to the truth
and to the rigor of their craft.

1439
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:03,545
Cuba and his Teddy Bear?

1440
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:05,547
This is getting better.

1441
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:06,548
You never know, man.

1442
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:08,550
One day you might be
as good as me.

1443
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:11,553
That day is today, baby.

1444
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:16,058
PAPP:
If the life of our author
seems elusive and troubling

1445
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:18,560
one can only applaud

1446
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,564
what is so candidly engaged here
by his art

1447
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:27,569
where nothing is stolen
or borrowed...

1448
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:29,071
and a great deal is revealed.

1449
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:32,574
PINERO:
Hi.

1450
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:35,077
I really want to thank you
for your welcome

1451
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:37,579
and say thank you
to you, Joe.

1452
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:39,081
How you doing this evening?

1453
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:42,584
Look, it's like
everything he said is true

1454
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:44,586
you know, and, uh...

1455
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:47,589
In this sense, our playwright

1456
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:50,592
is as blessed
and as straight a writer

1457
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:52,594
as they come.

1458
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:56,098
Please welcome...

1459
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:59,101
Mr. Miguel Pinero.

1460
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:00,102
(applause)

1461
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:08,610
PINERO:
Dig it...

1462
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:16,618
(laughing)

1463
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:17,619
It's a great opportunity.

1464
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:19,621
Did you see it when
I did it with Marty?

1465
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:20,622
Hey, where you been?

1466
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:23,625
I've been taking in
the scenery, you know.

1467
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:26,628
Look, look,
please, please,
don't make a scene.

1468
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:28,130
This is his night.

1469
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:29,631
Come on,
it's his night.

1470
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:35,137
(laughter)

1471
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:38,140
(camera shutters clicking)

1472
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:04,166
(trumpet playing jazz)

1473
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:12,674
MAN:
Mr. Povod?

1474
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:16,678
Yeah, that's my name.

1475
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:20,182
Ask me again
and I'll tell
you the same.

1476
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:21,183
Here you go.

1477
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,684
How you
doing, brother?

1478
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:24,186
Good, good.
How are you?

1479
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:25,687
All right,
all right,
all right.

1480
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:27,189
Where to?

1481
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:31,693
PINERO:
Baby, you remember
the first time we came here

1482
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:32,694
I sang you a song?

1483
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:33,695
Remember that?

1484
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:36,198
I remember you
fell in the river.

1485
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:38,200
Oh, that reminds me...

1486
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:42,704
I wrote something
for you last night.

1487
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:44,206
You did?

1488
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:46,208
Yeah. First time
I write in months.

1489
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,209
You want
to hear it?

1490
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,211
Do I have a choice?

1491
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:50,712
Of course not.

1492
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:53,715
All right, check this out.

1493
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:56,218
(clearing throat)

1494
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:57,719
(sniffling)

1495
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:04,226
There are things
that never change

1496
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:06,728
and we are not one of them,
I fear.

1497
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:09,731
The trouble with
our love is here.

1498
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:12,734
The trouble with our love
is around

1499
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:14,736
when you cannot look me
in the eye

1500
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:16,238
and lie.

1501
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:19,241
When you run so far away

1502
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:22,244
that you forget
where to go back to.

1503
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:23,245
Now you are what

1504
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:25,747
you never
wanted to be.

1505
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:27,749
Go ahead, blame me.

1506
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:29,251
There are things
that'll never change.

1507
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:31,253
Now we're two strangers
with a past...

1508
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:35,757
and a future
that ain't gonna last.

1509
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:39,261
And that is the trouble
with our love.

1510
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:41,763
Last night,
we saw things

1511
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:43,765
like we never did.

1512
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:47,769
We both went our way...
and hid.

1513
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:53,775
You like it?

1514
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:56,278
Are you finished?

1515
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:59,781
Yeah. What do you think?

1516
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:03,785
You want to know
what I think?

1517
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:06,288
Do you want to know
what I really think?

1518
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:08,790
I've been hanging
in there all this time

1519
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:11,793
for this... a poem?

1520
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:18,300
What do you see
when you look at me, hmm?

1521
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:21,303
What do you see?

1522
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:26,308
I'm a real person.

1523
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:28,810
I'm a real person
that loves you.

1524
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:36,818
You know, Miguel...

1525
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:42,324
I really wish you would
have married me...

1526
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:44,826
made me happy...

1527
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:51,333
had a real life
instead of all this jive shit.

1528
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:53,835
I could've had your baby.

1529
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:57,339
Be just a little normal.

1530
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:02,344
I ain't dead yet,
you know?

1531
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:25,867
Where's-where's my van?

1532
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:26,868
Where's my van?

1533
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:28,370
What happened?

1534
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:29,371
Where's my van?

1535
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:35,377
They tow it away.

1536
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:38,880
I'm sorry, Miky.

1537
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:40,382
I saw it through
the window.

1538
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:43,385
(car alarm wails in distance)

1539
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:45,887
Let me explain it to you.

1540
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:47,889
I don't have the papers
because it's not my car.

1541
01:18:47,889 --> 01:18:48,890
It's my friend's.

1542
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:50,892
Does your friend
have the registration?

1543
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:52,394
Wait, you see,
it's not that simple, sir.

1544
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:56,398
OFFICER:
Jesus!

1545
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:58,900
Did he OD
or something?

1546
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:01,403
No, no, he was sick.

1547
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:03,405
We got to get
the coroner.

1548
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:13,915
Miky, come on.

1549
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:17,919
PINERO:
The doctor
says my body

1550
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:20,422
doesn't want
to cooperate,
you know?

1551
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,424
Doctors are
always wrong.

1552
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:25,427
I mean, who knows when
it's really your time to go?

1553
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:27,929
Look at me
with this HIV shit.

1554
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:28,930
Fuck 'em.

1555
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:30,432
You go when you're ready.

1556
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:32,434
So you better
sit your ass down

1557
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:35,437
and eat somecochi frito,
'cause this shit is ready.

1558
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:36,938
(coughing)

1559
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:40,442
And if this doesn't kill you
tonight, nothing will.

1560
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:43,445
Hey,Profe,you
got a clean shirt
I could borrow?

1561
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:45,447
Course I do.

1562
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:50,952
What?

1563
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:52,954
What?

1564
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:54,456
I love you,Profe.

1565
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:56,958
You know, no matter
what, I love you.

1566
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:00,462
We're the only
ones left, baby.

1567
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:03,965
Miky, come on.

1568
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:06,468
You're making me wet.

1569
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:08,970
It smells good,
you know?

1570
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,972
It smells good.

1571
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:14,476
Reality wasn't giving me
no play at the time

1572
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:16,978
when my ashtray became
the cemetery

1573
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:19,481
of all my lost memories.

1574
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:20,982
I wonder who wrote that tune

1575
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:23,485
about being back on top
in June?

1576
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:26,488
Nigger forgot about
September and December.

1577
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:28,990
Now that is a month to remember.

1578
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:31,993
Well, I'm going nowhere.

1579
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:34,496
Got nowhere to go.

1580
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:37,499
Going nowhere fast.

1581
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,502
But Sunday morning
in New York City

1582
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:43,505
for the junkie,
there ain't no pity.

1583
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:47,008
When walking down the street
with loaded dice

1584
01:20:47,008 --> 01:20:48,510
you hear the people say

1585
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:53,014
"Hey, there goes Miky...

1586
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:56,017
"Mike Pinero...

1587
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:59,521
the junkie Christ."

1588
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:04,025
(no audio)

1589
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:12,534
Buy me another drink, baby.

1590
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:15,537
But Tito...

1591
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:20,542
And they came from
out of nowhere, man.

1592
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:22,043
Boom, boom, boom!

1593
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:24,045
Blasting them .38s our way.

1594
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:27,048
I was in the car outside the
cash-your-checks joint, right?

1595
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:28,550
And he came out shooting...

1596
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,051
He? Who's he?

1597
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:40,562
Anyways, they ran, right?

1598
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:43,064
They ran their motherfucking
asses off.

1599
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:44,566
And those that didn't

1600
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:46,568
just laid down and played dead.

1601
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:47,569
(chuckling)

1602
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:50,572
He was badder
than all of them, man.

1603
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:52,073
I mean, it, like...

1604
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:55,577
it was, like... he was Satan
in Heaven, right?

1605
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:59,080
Fighting God for a piece
of the action, man.

1606
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:01,583
That was Tito Goya.

1607
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:07,088
A long way from Ponce, man.

1608
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:10,592
Fucking kid's in jail
somewhere in fucking Texas.

1609
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:13,094
I thought you said

1610
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:16,598
he was crushed by an icebox
or something.

1611
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:23,605
(no audio)

1612
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:37,118
I got to sit down.

1613
01:22:40,121 --> 01:22:41,623
(coughs)

1614
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:43,124
Hey!

1615
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:50,632
Julio, you call 911.

1616
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:52,133
I'll take care of him.

1617
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:01,643
He's okay.

1618
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:08,650
?  ?

1619
01:23:24,165 --> 01:23:26,668
PINERO:
Well, I never wanted
to be anybody

1620
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:28,169
but a guy once said to me,
"You can write

1621
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:30,171
and writing will get you
out of jail."

1622
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:33,675
And it did and it didn't,
'cause I had to keep doing bad

1623
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:35,677
to keep the writing good,
'cause I sell trouble.

1624
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:38,179
I'd go down, bring up a sponge

1625
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:40,682
another fish,
another pearl, maybe

1626
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:42,684
but after you make that dive
one too many times

1627
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:44,686
your ears get shot,
your eyes go blurry

1628
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:49,190
and one day you finally come
to the surface and you say

1629
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:52,694
"You know what?
I like it better down there."

1630
01:24:01,202 --> 01:24:04,205
Relax, Miky.
I'm right here.

1631
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:11,212
Okay.

1632
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:15,216
You know what to do
if I should go.

1633
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:18,219
You remember the poem?

1634
01:24:18,219 --> 01:24:21,723
Yeah, I remember.

1635
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:23,725
Don't worry.

1636
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:35,737
I want music and wine
and poets prepared to read

1637
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:38,239
to testify, okay?

1638
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:42,243
(vocally improvising)

1639
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:48,249
Relax.

1640
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:49,751
We got a lot of work to do.

1641
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:51,753
(chuckles)

1642
01:25:08,269 --> 01:25:11,773

1643
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:15,777

I don't want to be buried
in Puerto Rico.

I don't want to rest
in some north island cemetery.

I want to be near

the stabbing, shooting,
gambling, fighting

1691

unnatural dying
and new birth crying.

don't take me far away

Every player is a poet,
an actor, a statesmen, a priest

but most of all, he's a player.

1698
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:07,448
You go out there on the street

1699
01:28:07,448 --> 01:28:08,449
and you meet the world
of suckers

1700
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:10,952
the world of greed
and whatever other names

1701
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:13,955
have been defined for those
that seek something outside

1702
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:15,456
the acceptance of their society

1703
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:18,960
and you stand with your balls
exposed in the jungle of fear

1704
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,963
and you battle, and you fight
the hardest fight of your life

1705
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:22,964
each day out there

1706
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:25,466
in them streets that demand
blood to nourish

1707
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:26,968
its own energies.

1708
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:28,970
Today and all the todays

inside your soul, you know?

1710
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:31,973
And when it's over

1711
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:33,975
and the streets are soaking up
in the blood

1712
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:36,978
you smile and you know

1713
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:39,480
that you just won another day
with yourself, you know?
