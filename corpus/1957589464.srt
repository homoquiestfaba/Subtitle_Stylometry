177

180
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,403

while we watch The Real Lesbians of Northampton,

185
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:03,049
maybe you'll see how much fun we can have.

186
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,650
- [Woman On TV] I know what you're capable of doing,

187
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,118
I know it.

188
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:07,753
Admit it, you're cheating on me, I know.

189
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:08,754
- [Woman On TV] Well what do you want me to do?

190
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,623
Have boring vanilla sex with you

191
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,592
when there's women out there who would kill

192
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:13,993
to have a piece of this?

193
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,061
- [Woman On TV] Oh yeah?

194
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,530
Well, what about a piece of this?

195
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,865
Or this?

196
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,099
(Jill laughing)

197
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,367
Am I not good enough for you any more,

198
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:22,635
is that what it is?

199
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:23,903
- Isn't this fun?

200
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,171
- [Woman On TV] Too little too late!

201
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,539
Too little too late!

202
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,374
- So, can we go to a club?

203
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:31,644
I want to see what it's like.

204
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:32,511
- Sure.

205
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,581
(gentle jazzy music)

206
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:50,696
- Sebastian?

207
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,531
- David!

208
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,434
Lola's told me so much about you.

209
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:56,335
- Oh yeah?

210
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,137
All good, I hope?

211
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:59,472
- Of course.

212
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,207
I hope you don't mind I picked a vegan place.

213
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,475
- Not at all.

214
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,976
I love veganisms.

215
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,481
- The crab cakes here are amazing.

216
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,182
- Yeah but if you're a vegan,

217
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,652
why do you want to eat something that tastes like crab?

218
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,154
- Well I'm not vegan because I don't like the taste of crab.

219
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:19,125
It's more of an ethical, social, political,

220
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,661
environmental, and spiritual decision.

221
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:22,495
- Uh huh.

222
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:27,199
I guess there are some things I'll never understand.

223
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,201
- I like that about you.

224
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,204
- You like me?

225
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:33,706
- [Sebastian] I like how real you are.

226
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,441
- Oh, thanks.

227
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:38,244
I try, I mean, I don't try.

228
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,745
I just am.

229
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,013
- I don't know how many people I've gone out with

230
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:42,448
that just pretend to agree with me,

231
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,916
even if they didn't.

232
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,152
But you see, I have this ability

233
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,554
to see right through people.

234
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,760
- So, how do you know Lola?

235
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,395
- I thought she told you.

236
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,297
Lola's my girlfriend.

237
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,432
- Oh.

238
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,266
Oh.

239
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,568
Oh!

240
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,403
- [Sebastina] I'm looking for a man to date.

241
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:05,571
- In addition to--

242
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,907
- Yes, in addition to Lola.

243
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,277
- So you're looking for a third?

244
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,746
- No, no, no, a separate relationship.

245
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,082
One that Lola is aware of and accepts

246
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,551
and understands and one that my boyfriend is aware of

247
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,319
and accepts and understands.

248
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,054
I know it's not for everyone.

249
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,356
- Yeah, I could see that.

250
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,391
I'll be right back.

251
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:28,060
(phone ringing)

252
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:31,931
- [Lola] Hello?

253
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,532
- Are you fucking kidding me?

254
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,034
- David, calm down.

255
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,435
- [David] Why didn't you tell me?

256
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:37,703
- I thought after you met him,

257
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,138
you'd be more open minded about it.

258
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,306
I guess not.

259
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,974
- You guess not?

260
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,542
First of all, I don't want to date a man

261
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:44,944
who has sex with other people.

262
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,445
Second of all, I don't want to date a man

263
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,014
who has sex with women.

264
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,181
Third of all, I don't want to date a man who has sex

265
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:50,950
with my best friend's ex-girlfriend,

266
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,818
and fourth of all, I do not want to date a man

267
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,587
who has sex with you!

268
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,155
- Listen, he's a really cool guy,

269
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,290
and I thought you were a really cool guy.

270
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,694
- Having sex with him would be like having sex with you!

271
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:02,795
- You're right, David.

272
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,697
Polyamory isn't for everyone.

273
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,833
It requires maturity and thoughtfulness.

274
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,903
(smooth jazzy music)

275
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:19,645
- Bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadomasochism.

276
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:21,380
- That's too many words.

277
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,816
- [Jill] The D and the S double for two different words.

278
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,518
- You can't have a four-letter acronym

279
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,186
that stands for six words.

280
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,222
- You can stare, but not talk or touch.

281
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,924
- I hate it when people stare at me.

282
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:33,659
- [Jill] Nobody's going to be staring at you.

283
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,127
They're going to be staring at something interesting.

284
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,629
- I'm interesting.

285
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:37,863
- Unless you're tied to the ceiling in saran wrap,

286
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,065
you're not interesting.

287
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:39,899
- You've done that?

288
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,133
- [Jill] It's awesome.

289
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,101
- And that's sexy?

290
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,236
- Give it time, you'll see.

291
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,738
Some people use pseudonyms.

292
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:46,739
- Sally.

293
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:47,706
- [Jill] Huh?

294
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:48,841
- I've already thought about it.

295
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,810
My pseudonym is Sally.

296
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,112
- Oh, I was thinking something more like Spike or Wicked.

297
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,647
- Like the musical?

298
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:58,951
No, see Sally is perfect because it makes me anonymous,

299
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,219
but at the same time,

300
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,620
people will think my name is really Sally,

301
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,189
because why the hell would I choose that?

302
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,191
- Right because the name Sally is a boner killer.

303
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:08,060
- And if people think my name is really Sally,

304
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,030
it shows that I'm not afraid of exposing my real identity,

305
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,099
and that makes me cool.

306
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:16,836
(playful instrumental music)

307
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,391
So, this is it?

308
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:41,594
- [Jill] You ready?

309
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,596
- I mean, this is it?

310
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,031
- These places all look pretty low key from the outside.

311
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,534
- Okay, so this is it.

312
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,035
Yeah I mean, there's nothing wrong

313
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:52,872
with abandoned warehouses.

314
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,940
Spacious, affordable.

315
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,209
Kind of sexy in the right fantasy.

316
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,712
Plus I heard the BDSM keeps serial killers away.

317
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,380
So, yeah, I'm ready.

318
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,216
- We don't have to go.

319
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,685
- [Jamie] But I want to.

320
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,220
- They're not abandoned.

321
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,856
- No, I'm sure there's some meth heads around.

322
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:13,459
- [Jill] They're warehouses, they manufacture things.

323
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,761
- Yeah, like meth.

324
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,830
I mean, I'm not judging.

325
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,833
- We don't have to do this.

326
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,669
- [Jamie] But you want to, right?

327
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,237
- Well, since we're here.

328
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:28,007
- Of course, since we're here.

329
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,175
It'll be fun.

330
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,146
- Well, hi guys, are you members?

331
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,381
- Oh no, it's our first time.

332
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,850
- Oh well welcome, my name's Princess.

333
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,819
I have some paperwork for you guys.

334
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,620
- She's not very scary.

335
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,122
- She's not supposed to be.

336
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,757
- So anti-climatic.

337
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,325
- Alright, that's for you.

338
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,493
There you go.

339
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,498
- Waiver of liability,

340
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:56,635
binding arbitration, assumption of risk?

341
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:57,836
- It's just a formality.

342
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,338
- Well then it's a formality that my lawyer

343
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,773
should look over, and I can't give this to my lawyer

344
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,242
because she probably would prosecute for this.

345
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,044
And bill me for it.

346
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,278
Is this illegal?

347
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:10,082
- Well, technically BDSM is considered assault.

348
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,685
And unfortunately the law does not recognize

349
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,654
the consensual aspect of these particular activities.

350
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:17,356
- So that's a yes?

351
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,893
- Some people say that LGBT rights are the last wave

352
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,162
of civil rights to be legalized,

353
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,331
but we here beg to differ.

354
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:28,067
And sometimes we just like to beg.

355
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,268
- Do cops raid this place?

356
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,636
- Only the kinky kind.

357
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,872
We have a uniform night every month.

358
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:34,707
It is hot!

359
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,978
There's everyone, there's military, cops,

360
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,146
pilgrims, it's Indians,

361
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:44,516
it's absolutely completely not culturally cool,

362
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:45,784
but it's still hot.

363
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,219
- I'm never going to be able to run for office.

364
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,054
- [Princess] We have flight attendants, priests--

365
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,257
- I'm never going to be able to be a priest!

366
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,592
- All our files are strictly confidential.

367
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,261
- Let's just go.

368
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,195
- Why?

369
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,997
- Isn't it obvious?

370
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,766
- Well I mean, I don't really want to run for President.

371
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:03,235
And priesthood is overrated.

372
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,171
- Yeah, that's right, Jamie.

373
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:07,706
Or else you might actually have a point.

374
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:08,874
- Sally.

375
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,776
- [Jill] You're not Sally yet.

376
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,111
- Sounds like a challenge.

377
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,046
- It's not a challenge and I'm not in the mood.

378
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:16,382
- Well, what gets you in the mood?

379
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,616
BDSM?

380
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,585
'Cause you know, I know a club nearby,

381
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,587
within walking distance.

382
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,558
We might end up being investigated under the Patriot Act,

383
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,160
but you know just think,

384
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,331
the stories that we can tell our children someday.

385
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,668
- I always thought we'd keep this a secret

386
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:36,769
from our children.

387
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,738
- Yeah, I was just saying that.

388
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:42,074
- Right, if we even have kids.

389
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,208
- Exactly.

390
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,343
- No pressure.

391
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,178
- We've got time.

392
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:49,248
- Initial there, initial there.

393
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,617
Turn it over and initial.

394
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:55,120
(upbeat electronic music)

395
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,863
- Let's go get some snacks.

396
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,767
(whimsical instrumental music)

397
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,106
- Stop staring.

398
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,408
- You said I could stare.

399
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,243
- Yeah, out there, not in the kitchen.

400
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,111
- I don't see the difference.

401
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,913
- You guys must be new here.

402
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:28,747
- No.

403
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:29,648
- [Jill] Yes.

404
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,216
- I'm Mistress Chyenne.

405
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,718
- [Jill] Nice to meet you, I'm Jill and this is--

406
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,119
- Mistress Sally.

407
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,157
Uh, you can call me Sally.

408
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:42,828
- Welcome, and if you need anything, just let me know.

409
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,364
- This friendliness is creeping me out.

410
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:48,667
- And if there's anyone you want to play with--

411
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,402
- No, we just came to watch.

412
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,505
Or, not watch, um, we came for the snacks.

413
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:57,009
- Well if you change your mind, I know everyone in here,

414
00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:00,979
so just let me know and maybe I can fix you up.

415
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,449
- [Bob] Ooh, cupcakes!

416
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,283
Yes!

417
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,186
- How was your guys' scene?

418
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,320
- It was awesome.

419
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,822
You know I'm perfecting my aim,

420
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,590
so right now what I do is I just make cracking noises

421
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,392
with the whip without touching him.

422
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,294
Oh, it drives him crazy.

423
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,829
- Well you know what I said Bob,

424
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,130
if you need to practice on someone

425
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,364
you can have my slave.

426
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,567
She has a very high pain tolerance.

427
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,535
Nothing phases her.

428
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,370
- I'm going to take you up on that.

429
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,006
- Or you can have this one here.

430
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,308
- She's kidding, right?

431
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,909
- Yeah, she's kidding.

432
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,511
- Maybe we should go.

433
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:35,047
After I finish these chips.

434
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,114
- Let's sit.

435
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:41,787
- Well you'd think for 20 bucks the snacks

436
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,388
would be a little better.

437
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:46,558
- So, what do you think so far?

438
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,093
- It's intriguing.

439
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:49,128
- [Jill] Does that mean we don't have to stay

440
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,162
in here all night?

441
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,530
- What's wrong with in here?

442
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,332
- Because if you're satisfied with your $20 chips,

443
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:54,633
I'm going to go hang out in the main room

444
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,101
and I'll be back in an hour.

445
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:56,935
- You're not leaving me!

446
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,170
- Oh yeah?

447
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,272
What if I order you to stay?

448
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,074
- You can't order me.

449
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,644
- Order you to stay in here or drag you around

450
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,379
on a leash out there.

451
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:08,881
- No one's wearing leashes here!

452
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,983
- [Jill] All the more reason to make you.

453
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,186
- If we bring a leash next time, I'm putting it on you.

454
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,121
- We'll see about that.

455
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:21,960
(gentle instrumental music)

456
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,564
- [Instructor] Take a deep breath in your nose,

457
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:28,133
and exhale through your mouth.

458
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,537
- That woman will stop at nothing!

459
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,238
It's bad enough we have to compete for your affection,

460
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:35,240
we have to have the same boyfriend too?

461
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,142
- Oh, I don't have much affection for Lola.

462
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:38,610
- What is wrong with that woman?

463
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,112
Then to say that I don't have the maturity

464
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,613
to go through with it!

465
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:45,083
I'll show her, she can't intimidate me out of this!

466
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,318
- [Class] Ohm.

467
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,026
- [Instructor] Good, take this moment

468
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,028
to reflect on yourself.

469
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:58,797
- See, isn't this nice?

470
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,132
- Yeah, lovely.

471
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:05,971
- Sebastian says yoga helps align himself with the universe.

472
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:09,207
- I'm so glad he's inspired you to be a better man.

473
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:11,376
- I bet Lola doesn't take you to yoga on your friend dates.

474
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,477
- No.

475
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:15,347
But Jill takes me to BDSM clubs.

476
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:16,782
- What?

477
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,050
You guys go to sex clubs?

478
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,385
- No, there's no sex.

479
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,621
- How can it be a sex club if there's no sex?

480
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,590
- It's not a sex club!

481
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,424
- Shh!

482
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:29,728
- Creepy.

483
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,798
(gentle jazzy music)

484
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,868
(knocking)

485
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,340
Hey.

486
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,374
- Hey!

487
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,009
It's from my garden.

488
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,511
- Oh, it's ah, lovely.

489
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:47,746
Thank you.

490
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,281
- [Sebastian] It's cilantro.

491
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,049
- I know what it is.

492
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,523
- [Sebastian] I'm glad you wanted to see me again.

493
00:20:58,523 --> 00:20:59,791
- Of course.

494
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,727
You're a cool guy, I'm a cool guy,

495
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,128
this is fun.

496
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:04,396
- Most guys run screaming

497
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,365
when I tell them I have a girlfriend.

498
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,133
- That's understandable.

499
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,435
Polygamy isn't ah, you know, for--

500
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,271
- Polyamory.

501
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,839
- Polyamory.

502
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,741
That's what I said, isn't it?

503
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,476
- Sounds like you've been watching too many specials

504
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:18,810
on Mormons.

505
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,646
(both laughing)

506
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,148
- Yeah, ah, this is different.

507
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,017
Right?

508
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,387
- Anything is what we make of it.

509
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:32,557
We get to choose, Mr. David Cho, what we make of it.

510
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,762
- Exactly my point.

511
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:40,599
As I was saying, polyamory isn't for everyone.

512
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,569
It requires maturity and thoughtfulness,

513
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,606
both of which I have massive amounts of.

514
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:48,874
- It means love.

515
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:49,708
- Huh?

516
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,710
- Amory, it means love.

517
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,578
Poly means many.

518
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:54,579
Many loves.

519
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,049
- That's beautiful.

520
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,885
Do you love Lola?

521
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:02,988
- Love is the ultimate goal in every human interaction.

522
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,156
For me anyway.

523
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:18,603
- You want some wine?

524
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,939
- I'd love some, thank you.

525
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:29,581
- So, do you two have any rules I should know about?

526
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:32,617
- Honesty and respect are our only rules.

527
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:35,153
- So, what would be your honest response

528
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:37,923
if I were to respectfully ask if you preferred penis

529
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,424
or vagina?

530
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:41,793
- My honest response would be that I think the question

531
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,795
is inherently flawed.

532
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:45,297
- [David] Just testing.

533
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,899
- Because as you know, men and women cannot be reduced

534
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:50,068
to their mere genitalia.

535
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,837
And furthermore, human beings can't be reduced

536
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,271
to their gender.

537
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,541
- You took the words right out of my mouth.

538
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,010
- Of course, there are many differences between men

539
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,646
and women, and I love and cherish those differences,

540
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,248
which is why I like to have a nice balance

541
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:05,016
of yin and yang in my life.

542
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,319
- Yes, yoga helps me get in touch

543
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,221
with my inner yin and yang.

544
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,022
- [Sebastian] Oh, you do yoga?

545
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:12,390
- I didn't tell you?

546
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,227
Yes, my friend Jamie and I do yoga together.

547
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,562
She's not that good, but we all need to start somewhere.

548
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,064
- Like Lola.

549
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,933
She just started recently, she said I inspired her.

550
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,335
- Oh really, hmm.

551
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:28,640
(whimsical instrumental music)

552
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,551
- Those are paddles.

553
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,538
That's just a neck massager.

554
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:09,381
I have a few different floggers.

555
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,049
Did you want to see what they feel like?

556
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,350
- Maybe later.

557
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,486
- I could give you a neck massage first.

558
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:15,320
- No.

559
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:22,394
- It's different for everyone, but for me,

560
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,029
it's not just about the sensation.

561
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,330
It's about the dynamic,

562
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,565
the power exchange.

563
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:28,366
One person having all the power,

564
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:31,269
and the other person giving it up.

565
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,440
- Like I say, maybe later.

566
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:40,111
And you say, no, you suck it up, bitch!

567
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:41,313
- Kinda.

568
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,347
- Except I want to be the one that says,

569
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:44,249
you suck it up, bitch!

570
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:48,887
- Okay.

571
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:06,204
Take off your shirt so you can see what these feel like.

572
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:07,539
- I don't need to take my shirt off to say,

573
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,107
suck it up, bitch.

574
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,711
- You'll learn through experience.

575
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,379
Take off your shirt.

576
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,492
(Jamie sighing)

577
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,261
We're going to do a simple scene, okay?

578
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:30,462
So if you have anything to say,

579
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,230
speak now or forever hold your peace.

580
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,498
- What's my safe word.

581
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:34,733
- [Jill] You don't need a safe word,

582
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:35,967
I'm going to take it easy on you.

583
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:38,603
- Well what happens if I go into subspace?

584
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:40,572
I know how to do internet research.

585
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,107
- This is a light test run.

586
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,575
You're not going to have enough endorphins going

587
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,277
to go into subspace.

588
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:46,711
Now turn around.

589
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,316
- Wait, I can still be the butch one if we do this, right?

590
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:52,751
- Yeah.

591
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:53,919
- Okay, cool.

592
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:00,792
- Can you feel this?

593
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,193
- Barely.

594
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:03,328
- That's because you didn't take your shirt off!

595
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,796
- I'm keeping it on!

596
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:05,764
- That doesn't mean I can't give you shit about it,

597
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:07,565
now be quiet!

598
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,034
I can talk.

599
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:12,571
You can only scream unless I ask you a question.

600
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:17,008
This is a bunny flogger.

601
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:19,311
It's a sensual flogger, good for a warm-up.

602
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:20,145
- Meh.

603
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:24,950
- No talking unless I ask you a question.

604
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,359
This one is suede.

605
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,262
You always aim for the fleshy part at the top of the back,

606
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,531
avoiding the spine and the kidneys.

607
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:42,667
Now on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the most pain,

608
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,302
how much pain are you in?

609
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:45,136
- Two?

610
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,046
Ah!

611
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:56,181
Ah!

612
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:57,115
Ah!

613
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,950
- This one is leather.

614
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,686
There are two kinds of pain, good pain and bad pain.

615
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:03,788
Good pain is like when you get a good massage.

616
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,957
Bad pain is like when you're hurt.

617
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,860
It's all about exploring and exploiting the good pain.

618
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,762
Now where are we on the scale?

619
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:11,863
- Um, three?

620
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,966
- Yeah? How about now?

621
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,102
- Safe word!

622
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:19,137
Uh, sorry, that was fine.

623
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,672
Um, I think it was a four.

624
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:22,073
You can continue.

625
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:30,415
- Rule number one, always leave them wanting more.

626
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:40,191
(smooth, jazzy music)

627
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,300
(knocking)

628
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,535
- That must be Lola.

629
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:51,369
She's early.

630
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:52,303
- Huh?

631
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,539
- I invited her for dinner.

632
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,374
- You shouldn't have.

633
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:00,779
- Hi David.

634
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,013
- Hi.

635
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,281
- [Sebastian] Can I get you guys a drink?

636
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,115
- Please.

637
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:06,217
- [Lola] Yes, thank you.

638
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,320
- What are you doing here?

639
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,423
- Sebastian invited me for dinner.

640
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:12,690
- And you knew I was going to be here?

641
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,060
- Yeah, he said he had a new recipe to try.

642
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,662
- Did you tell him I hate new recipes?

643
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:18,897
- You're tense.

644
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,867
He's got a really nice place.

645
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:25,603
- You haven't been here before.

646
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:27,205
- My place is closer.

647
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,807
- Closer to what.

648
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,775
- Closer to me.

649
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:31,976
Have you been here?

650
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:35,246
- No, because my place is closer to me!

651
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:36,748
- Okay then.

652
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:39,284
Sounds like someone could use a drink.

653
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:40,351
Or a handjob.

654
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:44,155
- Okay, that's really none of your business,

655
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:46,024
but just in case it might be,

656
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:48,359
I don't need the latter because my sex life with Sebastian

657
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,261
is very satisfying.

658
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:51,529
Do you know what that means?

659
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:54,365
That means one, two, three times an hour!

660
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,367
What about you?

661
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:57,836
- Well, it's not a competition but--

662
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:59,604
- [Davod] Or is it?

663
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:01,773
- Our sex life is very satisfying.

664
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:02,974
- [David] Are we talking one, two, three times

665
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:04,609
an hour satisfying?

666
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,544
- It's quality, not quantity.

667
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:10,615
- Well does it bother you that ours is quality and quantity?

668
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,517
- David, it's not a competition.

669
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:13,952
Sex with a man and sex with a woman

670
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,820
are completely different things.

671
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,255
- [David] Yeah, you would know.

672
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,257
- Yes, I would know.

673
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:22,894
- So it's not a competition because sex with a man is better

674
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:25,597
and that's why you're banging Sebastian and not some girl?

675
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,899
And that's why Sebastian is banging me, or rather,

676
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:31,169
I'm banging him more times than he's banging you.

677
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:32,971
- No, it's not a competition

678
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,839
because they're both different experiences.

679
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:37,208
One isn't better than the other.

680
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,743
That's what it means to be bisexual,

681
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:41,546
or did Sebastian not properly explain that?

682
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,581
- I know what it means to have sex with two different people

683
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:45,550
with one person being better, okay.

684
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,519
And Sebastian told me, he's not bisexual,

685
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,753
he's sexually fluid,

686
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,455
- You don't even know what the difference is.

687
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,623
- Nobody does!

688
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:56,361
- Here you go.

689
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,729
I'd like to make a toast.

690
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:59,531
To two beautiful people in my life.

691
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,399
It means so much to me to have both of you here together

692
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,067
this evening.

693
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:05,303
Despite that our relationships are separate

694
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,804
from one another,

695
00:30:06,804 --> 00:30:09,140
the fact that you guys are friends,

696
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,177
that inspired me to bring us here together,

697
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:14,546
and I couldn't be happier.

698
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:17,482
(glasses clinking)

699
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,720
- This is interesting beer.

700
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,355
- [Sebastian] It's homemade Kombucha.

701
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:26,991
- I love it, lots of healthy probiotics.

702
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,027
- Is there alcohol in this?

703
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,562
- Just a slight trace.

704
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,163
If you drink it quick enough, you might be able to feel it.

705
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,332
You guys ready for dinner?

706
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:43,808
Everything is raw, this is my raw lasagna.

707
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,645
Here you go.

708
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:50,048
It's made out of thinly sliced zucchini for the noodles,

709
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:52,517
and then pureed cashews for the cheese.

710
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,286
- [Lola] Oh, I've had this before, it's rich but delicious.

711
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,922
- So, this is just vegetables with nuts?

712
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:00,258
- Yeah, I call it raw-sagna.

713
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,364
- Mmm, this is fantastic.

714
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,732
- Thank you.

715
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:09,200
It's kind of labor intensive but it's worth it.

716
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,436
- I bet if you just made a salad with nuts, it'd be quicker.

717
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,504
- This is better, try it.

718
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,578
- Mmm, this is good.

719
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:21,946
- [Sebastian] I'm glad you like it.

720
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:23,214
More Kombucha?

721
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,048
- No thanks.

722
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,950
- [Lola] Please.

723
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,519
- Actually, I'd love some more.

724
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:40,498
- So, while Lola and I have dated a few weeks longer

725
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:41,733
than David and I,

726
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,268
we're all on the same page

727
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:45,270
in terms of sexual encounters.

728
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,172
And, since I haven't had sex with either one of you yet,

729
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:52,877
I thought, why don't we do something truly memorable?

730
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:57,048
Wouldn't it be incredible if we all had sex together?

731
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:03,888
- I'm in.

732
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:05,390
- Me too.

733
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,424
- Wonderful.

734
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,692
To us!

735
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:08,526
- No you're not.

736
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:09,727
- Sure I am.

737
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:10,795
- You've never even been with a woman before.

738
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:12,063
- Can't be that hard.

739
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,097
- We don't climax if we don't feel mentally

740
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,565
and emotionally connected.

741
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:15,967
- What do I care.

742
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:20,905
- To us.

743
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:22,840
- To us!

744
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:12,023
- [Jill] What are you doing?

745
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:13,358
- Just cuddling.

746
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,379
- Stop moving.

747
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:35,780
- I gotta get up.

748
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:39,684
- Are you gonna make breakfast for us?

749
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,120
- No, I'm gonna mow the lawn.

750
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,056
- Before breakfast?

751
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:47,692
- Yeah, it's happened.

752
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,193
- [Jill] What's wrong?

753
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,027
- Nothing.

754
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,564
- Cuddle with me.

755
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:07,311
You sure went to bed early last night.

756
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:08,212
- Oh, yeah.

757
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:14,552
- I was hoping we could continue the fun when we got home.

758
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,889
- Yeah, next time we'll have to do that.

759
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:22,393
- So there's going to be a next time?

760
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,595
- Yeah, I mean, you want to go back?

761
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:26,230
- [Jill] Yeah, I want to go back.

762
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,266
And then take you home

763
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:32,336
to fuck you like you've never been fucked before.

764
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:46,717
- She was trying to cuddle me from behind this morning!

765
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:48,886
She's starting to become the butch one, David!

766
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,721
- [David] Jill's always been the butch one.

767
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:51,856
- How can she be the butch one?

768
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,691
I'm the one who straps it on!

769
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:54,792
- [David] Not for long.

770
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:57,962
- God, what am I going to do?

771
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:59,797
- What's the big fuckin' deal anyway?

772
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,232
So Jill's the butch one.

773
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:03,634
Surprise, you're the last fuckin' one to know!

774
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:05,503
Don't take yourself so seriously.

775
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:08,573
- Oh, that's really funny coming from you.

776
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:09,841
- You should try meditating.

777
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:12,109
- Meditating to make me more butch?

778
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:15,113
- I don't think that would work,

779
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,850
but it will help ground you and put things into perspective.

780
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,918
Sebastian does it every morning, afternoon, and night.

781
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:24,088
He says it helps him get through long bouts of chastity.

782
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:27,024
But that's a whole other story.

783
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:28,726
- So you guys haven't had sex yet?

784
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:30,495
- The date is approaching.

785
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:32,663
- Did you put it on your calendar?

786
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:33,764
- Yes, I did.

787
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:37,568
She can not win.

788
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:42,607
She can not win.

789
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,145
She can not win.

790
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:52,517
- [Jamie And David] She can not win.

791
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,520
She can not win.

792
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,657
She can not win!

793
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,027
She can not win!

794
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:06,764
(upbeat electronic music)

795
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:10,535
- Okay, so, I'm gonna take this real easy on you,

796
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:13,871
because I don't think you can handle it.

797
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:16,207
Put this on!

798
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,513
Hurry it up!

799
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:29,487
These too!

800
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,932
Okay, nevermind, forget about it!

801
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,767
Now, uh, lick my boot!

802
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:49,740
- Jamie--

803
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,708
- [Jamie] Sally!

804
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,376
That's Master Sally!

805
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:54,679
- Master Sally--

806
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,114
- [Jamie] Thigh Master Sally!

807
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:01,085
- Thigh Master Sally, I can't see your boot.

808
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:02,320
- Then find it!

809
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,241
I didn't tell you that you could get up,

810
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:25,409
now get back down there!

811
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,677
- Jamie--

812
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:28,512
- That's Master Sally!

813
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:32,116
- Master Sally, you know every relationship

814
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:33,451
is based on trust.

815
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:36,153
- [Jamie] Thigh Master Sally!

816
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:38,856
- And trust is based on communication.

817
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,691
- Now get back down there and give me ten leg lifts,

818
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:45,162
because they don't call me the Thigh Master for nothing!

819
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:48,432
- You're not a Dom, you can't fool me.

820
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:51,202
- Jill, you're ruining the scene.

821
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:55,973
- That's Mistress Jill to you,

822
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:58,976
now get down there and kiss my feet!

823
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:01,846
What do you say?

824
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:04,515
- Um, I love your sanitary feet?

825
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,184
- Thank you, Mistress.

826
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:08,119
- Oh, thank you, Mistress.

827
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,320
- [Jill] I can't hear you.

828
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,155
- Thank you, Mistress!

829
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:14,792
- Come here.

(Jamie sighing)

846
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:43,581
- Hello?

847
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:51,956
- [Jamie] Do you have any idea what time it is?

848
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,491
- [Lola] We have our yoga date, remember?

849
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:55,259
- Ugh, do we have to?

850
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:56,293
- Rough night, huh?

851
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:57,561
- I don't get the appeal.

852
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,230
You just do yoga to impress Sebastian,

853
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,932
as if he's going to fuck you extra hard because of it.

854
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,734
- So, rough night.

855
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,336
- I had a great night.

856
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,004
- Sometimes rough is great.

857
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:09,006
- [Jamie] You don't need to know any details.

858
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:10,841
- I'm not asking details.

859
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,243
- Good.

860
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,178
So why did you set David up with Sebastian

861
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:15,980
when you guys hate each other?

862
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,548
- We don't hate each other.

863
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:18,549
Is that what he said?

864
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:20,985
- No, I just know both of you.

865
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:22,887
- We don't hate each other.

866
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:24,321
And if Sebastian's going to date a guy,

867
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:26,090
I want to have control over the situation.

868
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,892
And I can control David.

869
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:30,728
- Wow, how very insecure of you.

870
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:31,896
- It's smart.

871
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:34,965
Especially now with the threesome.

872
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:35,800
- I don't,

873
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,302
I don't understand.

874
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:39,470
- He didn't tell you.

875
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,071
- You had sex with David?

876
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:42,339
- No!

877
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:44,742
We have a pending date for a threesome

878
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:47,311
that he's going to back out of.

879
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:48,546
Why didn't he tell you?

880
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:50,247
- Because I would yell at him!

881
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:51,916
- No, it's because he's bluffing

882
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,918
and he didn't want you to tell me.

883
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:56,387
- I don't think that he's bluffing, Lola.

884
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:58,722
He said he put some sex date on his calender

885
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:00,257
and then he started meditating.

886
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:01,459
- That poser!

887
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,060
I started meditating!

888
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,728
- What, you guys both can't meditate?

889
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:06,263
- That's not the point!

890
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:08,199
He's only doing it because he found out I'm doing it,

891
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,267
and he doesn't want to lag behind.

892
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,269
- Well it doesn't sound like you meditated this morning

893
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:16,006
and no offense, but you probably should have.

894
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:20,678
Here, let me get it.

895
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:21,612
- I got it.

896
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:24,682
- Here.

897
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:28,352
- Just sit down and relax.

898
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:41,165
(slow jazzy music)

899
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,593
- Here, let me get it.

900
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:12,296
- Do you have to do everything all the time?

901
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:14,465
- That's not what I meant.

902
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:19,069
- It's my romantic dinner I cooked.

903
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,639
I want to treat you,

904
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:24,575
like a lady.

905
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:34,685
More wine?

906
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:36,353
- Please, thank you.

907
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:45,262
- Here is to our first month living together!

908
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:47,164
- Yeah, it's been an adventure.

909
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:51,335
Uh, very interesting, but great, fantastic adventure.

910
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:00,277
These are for the food, right?

911
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:04,148
Suck it up, bitch!

912
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:08,719
I said suck it up, you little pansy ass!

913
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,988
You little cry baby!

914
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:13,290
This is just a wimpy bunny flogger!

915
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,359
A bunny died to make this!

916
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,027
Have some respect!!

917
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:18,262
- [Jill] Cute pig.

918
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,363
- Hey!

919
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:20,397
- [Jill] Is that yours?

920
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:22,299
- Uh, we weren't close.

921
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:25,903
- You can practice on me, you know.

922
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:27,504
- [Jamie] I just, I want to get better first.

923
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:28,772
- Yeah?

924
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,007
Is he giving you good feedback?

925
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:31,041
- Well, he lets me be the butch one

926
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:32,910
without giving me shit about it.

927
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,845
- [Jill] Topping has nothing to do with being butch.

928
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:35,846
- Yeah, says you.

929
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:38,882
- Yeah, says me, your girlfriend.

930
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:42,720
Besides, maybe I like things the way they are.

931
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,556
- Which way is that?

932
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:46,924
- I think you know what I mean.

Hey Lola, ready for our threesome?

971
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:19,136
I never have sex without my micro claws.

972
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,575
- [Jamie] I can't believe you didn't tell me.

973
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:25,843
- Are you kidding?

974
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,344
I never thought it would get this far.

975
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,478
- [Jamie] Yeah but you're not going to go through with it,

976
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:29,479
are you?

977
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:30,948
- Yeah, with the micro claws.

978
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:32,416
That's why I'm bringing them.

979
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:34,885
- [Jamie] You know what I mean, if it didn't scare her off.

980
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:38,288
- Listen I may be competitive, but I'm not stupid.

981
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:40,958
- So that's a no, right?

982
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:41,792
- Yes.

983
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:45,028
Yes, that's a no!

984
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,630
What does it matter to you?

985
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,932
- It's just weird.

986
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:50,133
- So is this.

987
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:51,835
- [Jamie] It's just a neck massager.

988
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:53,570
- Oh no my friend.

989
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:54,805
No, this, this,

990
00:47:57,074 --> 00:47:59,743
this is a ball crusher!

991
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,679
And I am going to crush Lola's tiny little man balls in it

992
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:06,183
so hard, she'll wish she was born a women!

993
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:09,987
- [Jamie] Then what's Jill doing with it?

994
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:12,623
- What's Jill doing with any of this stuff?

995
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:15,459
I mean, a corset 10 sizes too big.

996
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:24,101
- Yeah, that's pretty weird.

997
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:28,205
- Come on, you know you want to.

998
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:29,373
- What?

999
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:30,474
- Put it on.

1000
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:31,708
Come on, I won't tell.

1001
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:33,110
- I'm not fucking putting that on.

1002
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,912
- Your titties will look friggin' huge.

1003
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,180
- Don't talk to me that way!

1004
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,849
- If you're not secure enough in your masculinity,

1005
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:39,850
that's fine.

1006
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,785
But I think you should.

1007
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,622
- I got nothin' to prove.

1008
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:47,958
- Fine.

1009
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:49,059
Whatever, you're boring.

1010
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:50,394
- You're boring.

1011
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:53,997
- Well, this should be plenty.

1012
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:58,201
Wish me luck, I'm gonna need it.

1013
00:48:58,201 --> 00:48:59,937
- [Jamie] Good luck.

1014
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,505
- And hey, good luck to you too.

1015
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:03,607
- [Jamie] For what?

1016
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:04,508
- You know.

1017
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:08,545
You've got some interesting nights ahead of you.

1018
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:11,381
(whimsical music)

1019
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:19,022
- Oh my god,

1020
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:22,359
my titties look friggin' huge.

1021
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:32,102
(giggling)

1022
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:34,338
Oh, hey!

1023
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:35,272
You ready?

1024
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:36,206
I'm just going to change and--

1025
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:37,207
- I think you should wear that.

1026
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:38,442
- This?

1027
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,010
I'm just, I'm just fuckin' around.

1028
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,446
- [Jill] I bought it for you.

1029
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,282
- What?

1030
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:46,450
No you didn't.

1031
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:56,560
Why would you think I'd want to wear this?

1032
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,729
- Uh, you are, aren't you?

1033
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:01,231
- Yeah but I mean, just to prove to myself

1034
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:03,166
I've got nothing to prove.

1035
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:06,570
And to see how big my boobs would look.

1036
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:09,673
You don't think this is sexy, do you?

1037
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:14,044
- I think it's a little taboo for you to wear it,

1038
00:50:14,044 --> 00:50:15,445
and that's sexy.

1039
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:16,713
- [Jamie] Yeah?

1040
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,317
- And your discomfort's sexy too.

1041
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:21,785
- Yeah?

1042
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:23,920
Oh, you're right, I mean, this is really uncomfortable.

1043
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,757
(upbeat electronic music)

1044
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:29,926
Okay, so this is really uncomfortable.

1045
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,365
Hey look, it's that hot girl we used to know.

1046
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,334
- She has a name Jamie, and it's Melina.

1047
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:39,269
- Let's go talk to her.

1048
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:47,377
Hey Melina!

1049
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:49,212
Hey Jamie!

1050
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:51,481
- Oh, I go by Sally here.

1051
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:53,383
- S&M Sally, I love it!

1052
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:56,920
Ooh, and I love that corset.

1053
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,922
- Oh it's, thank you.

1054
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:01,725
- It's so daring and unexpected for you.

1055
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,559
It's hot.

1056
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:06,062
Here I go by Firecracker.

1057
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:08,098
- Firecracker, that's hot!

1058
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:09,132
- [Melina] Literally.

1059
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:10,133
- Literally.

1060
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:13,170
(giggling)

1061
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:14,438
- Hi!

1062
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:15,272
- Jill?

1063
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:16,173
What are you doing here?

1064
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:18,542
Are you guys a couple?

1065
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:20,143
- Yeah, we're a couple.

1066
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:22,446
- A couple of kinky perverts that love meeting new women

1067
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:23,513
to play with.

1068
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,483
So are you a Dom or a sub?

1069
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:27,684
- I switch.

1070
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:29,019
- [Jamie] What's your drug of choice?

1071
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:30,420
- Sharp things.

1072
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,657
- Ohh, that sounds very dangerous.

1073
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:36,693
- Oh it is, if you do it with me.

1074
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:39,229
And tonight I brought needles.

1075
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:40,464
- Oh yeah?

1076
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:41,598
Is that an invitation?

1077
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,834
- [Melina] Is that an RSVP?

1078
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:48,905
- Jill and I, we're going to do a scene tonight, so.

1079
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:50,607
- No, go ahead.

1080
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:53,510
We're branching out, so go for it.

1081
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,011
- Are you sure?

1082
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:58,715
- Yeah, I think Mistress Chyenne is getting out the vac bed,

1083
00:51:58,715 --> 00:51:59,716
and I want to try it.

1084
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:00,817
- Oh, what's that?

1085
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:02,018
- It's like shrink wrap.

1086
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:04,020
- Oh cool, I'll meet you there next!

1087
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,022
Okay cool, let's do it!

1088
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:08,959
(slow jazzy music)

1089
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:23,106
- [Melina] Take off your corset.

1090
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:26,543
- I never thought I'd say this, but I'd like to leave it on.

1091
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:28,645
- [Melina] Oh, so you're modest.

1092
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,714
- [Jamie] No, just out of shape.

1093
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:32,315
- [Melina] You're lucky you're not mine,

1094
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,550
or I'd make you do it.

1095
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:34,584
- You'd make me?

1096
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:35,719
- [Melina] Yeah, you know,

1097
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:36,853
it'd be good for you.

1098
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:38,188
Transcend your ego.

1099
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:39,689
- Oh, my ego?

1100
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:41,625
- Why do you think it's so awesome to crawl around

1101
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:43,927
on the floor like a dog?

1102
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:45,428
- I, I don't know.

1103
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:48,698
- Because for a moment,

1104
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:52,869
you get to know what it feels like to no longer care.

1105
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:58,275
Besides, have you seen the other women here?

1106
00:52:58,275 --> 00:52:59,543
And you?

1107
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:01,511
You're a total five.

1108
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,180
- [Jamie] Thank you?

1109
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:06,950
- Like a kid in a candy store.

1110
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:07,784
- Yeah.

1111
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:12,956
- Oh don't worry, the shiny will wear off soon enough.

1112
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:14,624
- I know.

1113
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:18,428
- Mmm, needle play.

1114
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:20,830
It's such a rush.

1115
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:24,968
People pay thousands of dollars for drugs

1116
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:28,972
when all they really need is the fuckin' needle!

1117
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:33,877
- It was intense!

1118
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,245
It's not like going to a doctor's office.

1119
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:37,113
It was like really fuckin' cool.

1120
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:37,948
- Yeah?

1121
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:39,149
I'm glad you liked it.

1122
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:40,817
- Jill, what are you doing?

1123
00:53:40,817 --> 00:53:43,086
Jill, what are you doing to me?

1124
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:44,287
Jill, I don't,

1125
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:45,589
I don't know if I'm ready for this.

1126
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:46,823
- [Jill] And what is this?

1127
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:48,625
- [Jamie] I don't know, you're not telling me.

1128
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:49,893
- Well you must have some idea

1129
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,795
since you told me you're not ready.

1130
00:53:51,795 --> 00:53:54,397
I bet you'd let Melina do this.

1131
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:56,466
- No, I wouldn't.

1132
00:53:56,466 --> 00:54:00,003
And that's a really fucked up thing to say.

1133
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:06,476
You can't be jealous about something

1134
00:54:06,476 --> 00:54:09,379
you gave me permission to do.

1135
00:54:09,379 --> 00:54:10,880
I thought we were trying new things.

1136
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,550
- No, you're trying new things.

1137
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:14,818
You are.

1138
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:16,620
- [Jamie] Is that so bad?

1139
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,021
- No, it's not bad.

1140
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:21,291
I'm just correcting you on the we.

1141
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:22,993
I've done the club scene.

1142
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:24,661
I don't need to go out every night.

1143
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:26,096
I want to settle down with you.

1144
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,197
- [Jamie] You're subletting your place.

1145
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:28,431
- So?

1146
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,666
- So you can go back anytime you want.

1147
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:31,101
And you know just as well as I do,

1148
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,602
that once you give up your apartment and we stop going out,

1149
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,437
it's over for us.

1150
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:36,272
We just stay home and become like every other lesbian couple

1151
00:54:36,272 --> 00:54:38,441
I know that never has sex.

1152
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:40,977
- We don't have sex now anyway.

1153
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:42,912
- [Jamie] We had sex a few weeks ago.

1154
00:54:42,912 --> 00:54:45,048
- A few weeks ago.

1155
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:49,919
We haven't had sex since we started going to the clubs.

1156
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:51,388
- It's just, it's a lot to take in, Jill.

1157
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:52,622
It's like one thing at a time, okay?

1158
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:54,557
Like, how does sex even work now?

1159
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:55,892
Are you the top?

1160
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:57,394
Do you strap it on for me?

1161
00:54:57,394 --> 00:54:58,528
I just--

1162
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:00,363
- You're overthinking it.

1163
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:03,166
And yeah, I want to top you in bed.

1164
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:05,235
Is that such a bad thing?

1165
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:12,375
- Look, I want that too.

1166
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:14,811
I do.

1167
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:17,213
I just, I'm not there yet.

1168
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:20,150
(slow jazzy music)

1169
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:35,632
- [Lola] Hello?

1170
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:36,466
- Oh, hi.

1171
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,537
I told Jamie to lock the door.

1172
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:42,872
- Oh, Jamie doesn't lock doors.

1173
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:45,175
- And you don't knock on them.

1174
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,176
- Is she coming back?

1175
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,144
We're supposed to go to yoga.

1176
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:49,779
- She's at yoga with David.

1177
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:51,114
- [Lola] They're at yoga?

1178
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:54,651
But today's my day to do yoga with Jamie.

1179
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:56,386
- Yeah, I don't know.

1180
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:01,491
- [Lola] Why do I feel like everything I do,

1181
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:03,760
he has to try to do better?

1182
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:06,963
- Yeah, I don't know.

1183
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:08,465
- He's just like Jamie.

1184
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:10,400
They're always trying to one-up the other person,

1185
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,601
like, see?

1186
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:13,970
Whatever you do, I can do better.

1187
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:16,039
- Jamie's not like that.

1188
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:21,611
- When I told Jamie I wanted to have a threesome--

1189
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:23,046
- Yeah, I don't need to hear about that.

1190
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,715
- [Lola] She was scared out of her mind.

1191
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:29,119
But then she goes out and rounds up five hot straight girls

1192
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,354
to have some kind of orgy that God knows

1193
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:35,191
she'd never have the balls to go through with.

1194
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:42,165
- What happened?

1195
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:43,266
- Nothing.

1196
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:44,634
That's the point.

1197
00:56:44,634 --> 00:56:46,136
It's all bravado.

1198
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:49,139
And I find bravado to be the most unattractive quality

1199
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:50,039
in someone.

1200
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:53,376
- Yeah well Jamie's not like that.

1201
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:55,145
- We were together four years.

1202
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:57,680
- That's not that long.

1203
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,416
- I think I know her pretty well.

1204
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:03,787
If you ever do decide to move in,

1205
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:07,123
you should get rid of these mini-blinds.

1206
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:11,060
So you know today's my day with Jamie, right?

1207
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,896
- You were with Jamie last Sunday.

1208
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:14,397
This week's my week.

1209
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:17,467
- No, you have the first and third Sunday of the month,

1210
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:19,068
I have the second and fourth,

1211
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:22,672
and we alter the fifth Sunday, if there is one.

1212
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:24,841
- Who knows what Sunday it is?

1213
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:26,476
We should do every other week.

1214
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:29,512
- Sebastian and I spend the first and third Sunday together,

1215
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:30,947
if we alter every other week,

1216
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,483
the fifth Sunday throws the whole schedule off!

1217
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:35,385
- See, this is why I'm gay.

1218
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:36,886
Too much drama with women.

1219
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:38,188
Rotating every fifth Sunday?

1220
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:40,290
Only a woman would come up with that!

1221
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:44,928
- [Jill] Why don't you spend the fifth Sunday with me?

1222
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:47,597
- You guys are gonna need to go.

1223
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:57,607
- So this guy shows up to go golfing with his buddies.

1224
00:57:57,607 --> 00:58:00,410
And they say, "Bob, what happened?

1225
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:05,481
"I thought you were going to stay home with your wife?"

1226
00:58:05,481 --> 00:58:09,319
And he says, "Yeah, she asked me to tie her up

1227
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,490
"and do what I wanted.

1228
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:16,359
"So I came golfing."

1229
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:18,628
(laughing)

1230
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:20,563
Get it?

1231
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:27,303
Okay, okay, keep that elbow up.

1232
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:32,942
- [Jill] Hey Firecracker.

1233
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:34,277
- Hey.

1234
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:35,378
Where's Sally?

1235
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:36,479
- She's busy.

1236
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:40,216
I heard you like sharp things.

1237
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:43,953
- If you come near me with that, I'll scream.

1238
00:58:53,162 --> 00:58:54,631
- Sharp edges.

1239
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:57,467
- You gotta be fuckin' kidding me.

1240
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:00,403
- Oh yeah?

1241
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:04,707
What do you think of this?

1242
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,376
- I think we haven't negotiated

1243
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:09,045
this weird cafeteria fantasy.

1244
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:11,781
And besides, I only go for butch tops.

1245
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:13,850
- Oh really, is that so?

1246
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,585
You don't think I'm butch enough?

1247
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:19,589
I happen to be the biggest fuckin' dyke in here.

1248
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:26,296
- Just because you have a spork, doesn't make you butch.

1249
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:27,397
- [Jill] Oh yeah?

1250
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,532
What about this?

1251
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:30,366
- Closer.

1252
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:35,405
- Or this?

1253
00:59:45,581 --> 00:59:47,216
- What time is it?

1254
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:48,217
- Uh, 11:35.

1255
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:51,621
- Sorry, gotta jet.

1256
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:53,356
I have to get up early.

1257
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:54,190
Next time.

1258
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:03,466
- You're getting better at this.

1259
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:13,609
- What the fuck are you doing with this thing?

1260
01:00:13,609 --> 01:00:15,645
- I think we should have a threesome with Melina.

1261
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:17,146
- [Jamie] What?

1262
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:19,082
- Be hot, wouldn't it?

1263
01:00:19,082 --> 01:00:20,616
- Is this a test?

1264
01:00:20,616 --> 01:00:23,086
Am I supposed to say no?

1265
01:00:23,086 --> 01:00:24,787
- No, I think we should go all the way.

1266
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:27,056
Confront out fears and come out the other side.

1267
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:28,324
- What fears?

1268
01:00:28,324 --> 01:00:29,659
- [Jill] My fear of her boobs in your face

1269
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:31,527
and your fear of me fucking you.

1270
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:32,762
- She has to be there for that?

1271
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:34,964
- [Jill] Not necessarily.

1272
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,966
- Well, do you think she'd want to?

1273
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:39,302
Like, you think she'd totally be into that?

1274
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,803
- Sure, why not?

1275
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:41,971
- [Jamie] But you think she'd totally be into that?

1276
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,406
Like, what do you think?

1277
01:00:43,406 --> 01:00:45,174
- Let me ask her.

1278
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:48,244
(smooth jazzy music)

1279
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:51,814
- [Sebastian] Good to see you!

1280
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:52,648
- You too.

1281
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:01,924
- Moving in?

1282
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:04,594
- I brought a few things for our night together.

1283
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:05,628
Should we get started?

1284
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:06,729
- Sit down, relax.

1285
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:07,930
Let me get you guys some drinks.

1286
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:10,833
Oh ah, I thought I'd bring some wine.

1287
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:13,703
- Ooh, thank you, how thoughtful.

1288
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:14,771
Red or white?

1289
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:15,805
- [Lola] I'm easy.

1290
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:16,973
- Yeah she is.

1291
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:19,475
I'll have what she's having.

1292
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:21,778
Actually, I'll have the opposite of what she's having,

1293
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:22,612
thanks.

1294
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:32,255
- For such a seemingly smart guy, he's ridiculously naive,

1295
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:33,089
isn't he?

1296
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:35,792
- If you're trying to distract me from my goal of having sex

1297
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:37,460
with the hottest man in Los Angeles,

1298
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,228
it's not gonna work.

1299
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:40,630
- That's exactly what I think.

1300
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:42,899
He is the hottest guy in Los Angeles.

1301
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:46,302
- So what, you trademarked that expression?

1302
01:01:46,302 --> 01:01:50,373
- No, I'm just saying we have something in common.

1303
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,175
- I see what you're trying to do.

1304
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:54,077
It's not going to work.

1305
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:55,545
- [Lola] What?

1306
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,513
- I don't know.

1307
01:01:57,513 --> 01:01:58,448
But I know.

1308
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:02,785
- I'm starting to doubt how smart he is though.

1309
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:04,287
- Yeah, I see what you're trying to do.

1310
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,955
And what difference does it make?

1311
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:08,391
You don't like it, door's that way.

1312
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:09,692
- Oh I'm not leaving.

1313
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:11,194
- Well me neither.

1314
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:15,031
So we have something else in common, look at that.

1315
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:29,312
Do you have to do that now?

1316
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:31,047
- You're just jealous because you don't look good

1317
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:32,515
in lipstick.

1318
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:33,516
- Yes, I do.

1319
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:51,534
I wouldn't want to get your herpes.

1320
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:01,644
- [Sebastian] Here you go.

1321
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:19,395
- It's uh, hot in here, huh?

1322
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:28,704
- You're right, it is hot.

1323
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:35,511
- I'm just glad you're both getting comfortable.

1324
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:48,324
- Why don't you two kiss?

1325
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:49,792
- Maybe because I don't like to eat red slime

1326
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:51,727
sloppy seconds.

1327
01:03:51,727 --> 01:03:53,362
- [Sebastian] Huh?

1328
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:55,031
- You have a little.

1329
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:59,802
- If you're not ready for this, I understand.

1330
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:01,337
- Oh I'm ready.

1331
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:02,805
I'm as hard as a rock.

1332
01:04:02,805 --> 01:04:04,006
- Great.

1333
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:06,576
I'm as slippery as a sea slug.

1334
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:07,843
- Yum.

1335
01:04:07,843 --> 01:04:09,245
Let's do this.

1336
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:11,080
- Yeah, let's do this.

1337
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:13,282
Can't wait.

1338
01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:16,319
- The anticipation is killing me.

1339
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:17,253
- Let's go!

1340
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:24,694
- It's so cool for you to invite me over, Jill.

1341
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,495
- Yeah, I thought that we would all benefit

1342
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:28,831
from getting to know each other better.

1343
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:32,168
- Yeah, know each other a little better.

1344
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:36,405
Know each other biblically!

1345
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:38,641
(laughing)

1346
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:42,478
- You're so cute when you're nervous.

1347
01:04:42,478 --> 01:04:43,846
- Oh I'm not nervous.

1348
01:04:43,846 --> 01:04:46,349
I'm just, you know, need some more drink.

1349
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:48,384
You want more drink?

1350
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:50,086
- No thanks, I'm fine.

1351
01:04:50,086 --> 01:04:54,257
- Jill, will you help me open some wine with your strength?

1352
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:56,859
- We don't have to do this.

1353
01:04:56,859 --> 01:04:58,394
- No, I want to.

1354
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:02,465
I just, maybe could using some coaching or tips or,

1355
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,868
just more to drink would probably be good.

1356
01:05:05,868 --> 01:05:07,870
- If you drink too much, you'll be sloppy in bed.

1357
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:09,505
- When have I ever been sloppy in bed?

1358
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:12,341
- If I've offended you and you want to cancel, that's okay.

1359
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:14,910
- No, I'll just, I'll meditate.

1360
01:05:20,816 --> 01:05:22,151
We should do this out there.

1361
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:24,553
Women think meditating is sexy.

1362
01:05:24,553 --> 01:05:26,122
- Who told you that?

1363
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:27,857
- Just seems sexy, I don't know.

1364
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:30,693
- Mmm, meditating is so damn sexy!

1365
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:34,030
- Yeah.

1366
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:36,966
- It's like having control and surrendering

1367
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:39,201
at the same time.

1368
01:05:39,201 --> 01:05:40,202
- Mmm, yeah!

1369
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:46,108
It's like bliss and discomfort at the same time.

1370
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:47,677
- Ooh yeah!

1371
01:05:47,677 --> 01:05:49,245
Mmm, ooh yeah, yes!

1372
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:51,647
Mmm yes!

1373
01:05:51,647 --> 01:05:52,648
Yes!

1374
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:53,916
Ooh yes!

1375
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:57,253
- I don't think you're supposed to talk.

1376
01:05:59,388 --> 01:06:02,191
- So, I brought some toys for our little evening.

1377
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:03,025
Let's see.

1378
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,294
Whip, crop,

1379
01:06:07,229 --> 01:06:08,064
oh, taser.

1380
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:12,268
(screaming)

1381
01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:15,504
Uh, oh, a vaginal clamp

1382
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:25,047
that I'm really looking forward to using.

1383
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:28,351
Ginger.

1384
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:32,521
To uh, cleanse the palate between courses, if you will.

1385
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:36,192
- It's for figging.

1386
01:06:36,192 --> 01:06:37,360
- [David] Huh?

1387
01:06:41,197 --> 01:06:43,532
- You peel it and insert it.

1388
01:06:45,034 --> 01:06:46,435
It feels amazing.

1389
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:48,504
- Oh, wow.

1390
01:06:50,706 --> 01:06:53,075
Cleanses your hidden palates.

1391
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:55,144
Must be tried to be believed.

1392
01:06:55,144 --> 01:06:57,646
- [Lola] I'm up for trying it.

1393
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:51,267
- Fine, you win!

1394
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:52,802
You win!

1395
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:54,036
- Huh?

1396
01:07:54,036 --> 01:07:55,271
- I'm not going to have a threesome with you,

1397
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:57,039
are you f-ing crazy?

1398
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,275
- Honey, you're just overwhelmed.

1399
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:01,343
Let's put the toys away and we'll just start

1400
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:02,611
with the basics.

1401
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:04,346
- I'm sorry but I'm just not as cool as you guys,

1402
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:05,815
apparently.

1403
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:07,850
I can't get an erection with that woman in the room!

1404
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:09,785
- You don't need an erection to bottom.

1405
01:08:09,785 --> 01:08:11,554
- I'm not a bottom.

1406
01:08:11,554 --> 01:08:13,122
- Okay if we're all going to have sex,

1407
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:14,857
we need to be honest with each other.

1408
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:16,392
- Well apparently I'm not ready

1409
01:08:16,392 --> 01:08:18,527
for this whole honesty sex stuff.

1410
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:20,129
I'm an immature liar who is afraid

1411
01:08:20,129 --> 01:08:22,531
of finding mushrooms growing inside of a vagina!

1412
01:08:22,531 --> 01:08:24,433
(Sebastian and Lola laughing)

1413
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:28,370
Some things in life are not worth knowing about!

1414
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:29,705
I'm not kidding!

1415
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:33,742
- Look, it's okay, not all of us

1416
01:08:33,742 --> 01:08:36,645
are going to be in the same place on their spiritual path.

1417
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:38,614
Your path might not intersect with our path,

1418
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:41,450
there's nothing wrong or bad about that.

1419
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:44,954
- So does that mean I leave and you have sex without me?

1420
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,056
- Well if you decide to go and Lola stays

1421
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:49,959
and has sex with me, yes.

1422
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:54,129
- Well, same path or different path, we're all on a path.

1423
01:08:56,932 --> 01:08:59,268
Growing, changing, evolving,

1424
01:09:00,769 --> 01:09:03,772
like a caterpillar into a butterfly.

1425
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:08,010
Like an acorn into an oak tree.

1426
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:11,647
- So you're going to take this step with us?

1427
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,115
- Well I was just kidding about that stuff.

1428
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:17,152
I mean, everyone knows vaginas don't grow things.

1429
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:23,025
And even if they did, it wouldn't be,

1430
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:25,194
it wouldn't really matter.

1431
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:29,899
But I think we need to set some ground rules.

1432
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:31,800
Do we have to touch each other?

1433
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,035
- [Sebastian] Not if you don't want to.

1434
01:09:33,035 --> 01:09:34,537
- I don't want to.

1435
01:09:34,537 --> 01:09:37,673
I mean, I don't want to make it awkward for Lola.

1436
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,441
- How thoughtful of you.

1437
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:40,709
- But I'm cool.

1438
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:43,145
I'm cool with this.

1439
01:09:43,145 --> 01:09:44,647
- Good.

1440
01:09:44,647 --> 01:09:46,215
I'm glad you're cool.

1441
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:49,318
(smooth jazzy music)

1442
01:10:10,272 --> 01:10:11,774
- You ready?

1443
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:13,375
- I'm ready.

1444
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:14,543
Are you ready?

1445
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:17,213
So, what do we do now?

1446
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,981
- Well you know what really gets me warmed up

1447
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:20,249
to just dive right in?

1448
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:21,483
- Huh?

1449
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:23,419
- When women lick my feet.

1450
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:24,687
- Yeah?

1451
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:26,021
- Yeah.

1452
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:26,855
- Alright.

1453
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:41,503
Are you sure this is okay?

1454
01:10:41,503 --> 01:10:42,338
- Yeah.

1455
01:10:46,809 --> 01:10:50,279
- Mmm, now let me hear you moan.

1456
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:52,948
(Jamie moaning)

1457
01:10:59,254 --> 01:11:00,522
- You like that?

1458
01:11:00,522 --> 01:11:02,658
- Mmm, yes, Sally.

1459
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:06,228
- Oh, hey, you don't need to call me Sally.

1460
01:11:06,228 --> 01:11:07,396
You know, the name's kind of a boner killer.

1461
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:08,931
- Get back down there!

1462
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,466
And if she wants to kill your boner, that's her prerogative.

1463
01:11:10,466 --> 01:11:11,467
- Yes ma'am!

1464
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:17,773
- Mmm, yeah, that's it Jamie.

1465
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:20,776
- Sally, come here and lick my feet.

1466
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:33,022
- Baby, come here, come lick Mama's feet.

1467
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:38,761
- Come here, baby, this Mama's feet need lickin'.

1468
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:40,396
- Baby, come here.

1469
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:41,563
- [Jill] Baby's not going anyway.

1470
01:11:41,563 --> 01:11:42,998
- [Melina] She will if I tell her.

1471
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:45,567
- She won't if I tell her!

1472
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:47,469
- Hey, you know, this is going really well,

1473
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:48,704
I guess and all but,

1474
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:50,239
you think you could loosen up a little bit?

1475
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:52,207
- I think this one needs to learn a little bit more

1476
01:11:52,207 --> 01:11:53,709
about sharing.

1477
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:57,746
- I think this one needs to learn a lot more about sharing!

1478
01:12:04,019 --> 01:12:05,220
- Babe--

1479
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:07,156
- You are not allowed to call her that.

1480
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:10,292
- If this domineering bitch doesn't work out for you,

1481
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:12,461
you know where to find me.

1482
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:22,338
- That was harsh.

1483
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:25,574
- And I'm tired of you fucking me over!

1484
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:33,115
- I'm gonna go lock the door.

1485
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:41,924
- You've been a very bad girl.

1486
01:12:46,295 --> 01:12:47,362
Get in there!

1487
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:51,133
Are you going to let her ruin our night,

1488
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:52,501
or are you going to do what I say?

1489
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:53,502
- Yes ma'am!

1490
01:13:25,701 --> 01:13:28,437
- [Sebastian] I'll be right back.

1491
01:13:37,346 --> 01:13:38,347
- Hey.

1492
01:13:38,347 --> 01:13:39,181
- Hey.

1493
01:13:41,316 --> 01:13:43,552
- Did you sleep well?

1494
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:44,720
- Not really.

1495
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:48,223
- Yeah me neither, this bed is too small.

1496
01:13:48,223 --> 01:13:49,224
- You think?

1497
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:54,963
- How are you?

1498
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:57,366
- I'm good.

1499
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:02,471
- That wasn't so bad, right?

1500
01:14:02,471 --> 01:14:06,475
- You were over there and I just saw penis so yeah,

1501
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:07,810
wasn't that bad.

1502
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:12,381
- I'm glad you put away the speculum.

1503
01:14:12,381 --> 01:14:13,515
- Hmm?

1504
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:15,317
- The vag clamp.

1505
01:14:15,317 --> 01:14:17,152
- Oh yeah, good times.

1506
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:20,722
Good times.

1507
01:14:21,857 --> 01:14:23,792
I thought it would scare you off.

1508
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:25,527
- It almost worked.

1509
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:26,728
- [David] Really?

1510
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:29,331
- No, I'm pretty fuckin' tough.

1511
01:14:30,265 --> 01:14:32,100
- Tough's kind of hot.

1512
01:14:33,402 --> 01:14:36,171
- We could try it next time.

1513
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:37,906
- I'm fucking with you.

1514
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:39,508
- I'm just fucking with you!

1515
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:42,177
(both laughing)

1516
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:49,151
- Don't tell Jamie, okay?

1517
01:14:50,252 --> 01:14:52,087
- It'll be our secret.

1518
01:15:00,128 --> 01:15:04,233
- I was supposed to back out of the threesome, wasn't I?

1519
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:08,270
- No, I wasn't being fair.

1520
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:10,105
I mean yeah, I wanted you to back out

1521
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:12,174
but for the wrong reasons.

1522
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:14,176
I should have let you do it.

1523
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:16,178
- So we'll have to invite her back then.

1524
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,679
- Or someone else.

1525
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,715
- Yeah, just kidding.

1526
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:22,184
I mean, I only went along with it because I like to think

1527
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:24,820
I'm up for trying most things at least once.

1528
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:27,055
- I like the sound of that.

1529
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:33,161
- Do you really want to invite somebody else?

1530
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:34,263
- No, do you?

1531
01:15:35,397 --> 01:15:36,231
- No.

1532
01:15:38,901 --> 01:15:41,203
Last night was the best sex that I ever had, you know.

1533
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:43,372
- Yeah, damn right it was!

1534
01:15:44,973 --> 01:15:48,076
And to think it only took us over a year to get this far.

1535
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:52,414
- Well, I like to think it was worth the wait.

1536
01:15:52,414 --> 01:15:53,649
- Yeah, it was.

1537
01:15:55,984 --> 01:15:59,721
Do you want to pick out curtains tomorrow?

1538
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:02,925
Or I could mow the lawn while you cook me breakfast?

1539
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:04,459
- No, don't get carried away.

1540
01:16:04,459 --> 01:16:09,197
I am still learning how to whip your ass, literally.

1541
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:11,066
- We'll see about that.

1542
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:13,001
- What the fuck are you doing with that?

1543
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:15,337
- Wouldn't you like to know.

1544
01:16:17,539 --> 01:16:19,541
- [Jamie] Yeah, I would.

1545
01:16:20,642 --> 01:16:22,811
- [Jill] Suck it up, bitch!
