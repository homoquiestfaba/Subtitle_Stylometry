[Panting]

2
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,982
- [Woman] Want toast?
- [Girl] Yes.

3
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:10,750
Ellie, where's your cereal bowl?

4
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,757
- I'm not hungry.
- You need to eat.

5
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:15,692
- I'm not hungry, Mom.
- You need to eat before school.

6
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,730
- One more bite.
- [Mom] You want jelly?

7
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,424
[Girl] Yes, please.

8
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,627
Watch it, Brenda.
Don't mess my clothes up.

9
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,670
Billy Baker's in my class this year.

10
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,705
- Oh, did he flunk too?
- Shut up!

11
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:29,333
- Hey!
- [Ellie] You're one to talk.

12
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:32,344
- [Mom] Are you excited about school?
- [Girl] Yeah.

13
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,346
- Isn't your sister cute?
- You stink.

14
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:35,506
[Girl] Very cute.

15
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:38,551
[Brenda] He stinks. He's gotta shower
before he eats with us.

16
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,813
[Mom] Stop picking
on your brother and eat.

17
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,653
[Faucet running, turns off]

18
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,850
May Belle?

19
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:48,052
- Honey, here's your juice.
- Thanks.

20
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,630
OK, who hid my sneakers?

21
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:55,190
Jess, you could hardly call them
sneakers anymore. I threw them out.

22
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,929
What? Mom!

23
00:03:57,003 --> 00:04:00,905
Sorry, but I will not send any child of
mine to school looking like some hobo.

24
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:04,375
There's a perfectly good old pair
of Brenda's I put out for you.

25
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,412
These are girls' ones.

26
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,176
It's the fan belt this time,
but I got another.

27
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,844
- Bye-bye.
- Ellie? Honey, here you go.

28
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,479
- What's the matter?
- There's a big race today.

29
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,614
- And?
- My sneakers.

30
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,887
- I got a perfectly good pair for him.
- These are girls' ones.

31
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,054
- I can't race in these.
- You couldn't race in your old ones.

32
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,121
He needs some new sneakers, Mary.

33
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,894
- [Brenda] Catch Billy's eye in that.
- We don't have anything for extras.

34
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,962
- [Ellie] Excuse me?
- [Brenda] You're excused.

35
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,770
They make them the same.
You got your chores done?

36
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,644
Just about to.

37
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:02,565
[Gasps, panting]

[Horn honking]

39
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:21,381
I try to keep my pit stops
under ten seconds, ace.

40
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,251
[Girl] Give it to me.

41
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,690
- Give it...
- Hey, that's my lunch!

42
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,192
I found it!

43
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,655
- You're kidding me.
- [All laugh]

44
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,928
[Driver] OK, that's enough.

45
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,861
Consider it a free lunch program,
farmer boy!

46
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,667
[Driver] All right, settle down.

47
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,772
[Girl] Good one, Janice.

48
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,606
What do you call your teacher?
I wanna tell Alexandra.

49
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,306
- "Monster Mouth." Now scoot.
- Alexandra,

50
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:53,341
- they call her "Monster Mouth" Myers.
- I said scoot!

51
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,355
A few ground rules for this classroom.

[Skipped item nr. 52]

53
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:59,648
No talking. No chewing gum.
No electronic devices. Be forewarned.

54
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,887
If you download essays
off the Internet,

55
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,896
you'll be downloaded into detention.

56
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:08,661
Let's start the year off on
the right foot and all do our own work.

57

Jesse Aarons!

61
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:23,639
I got it from your sisters.
I do not need it from you.

62
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,048
- Oh, man.
- That goes for you as well.

63
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,609
- He hit me.
- [Scoffs]

64
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,984
- You're dead meat.
- Scott Hoager and Gary Fulcher,

65
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,082
be quiet!

66
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:37,527
Now, back to what we were discussing
before we were so rudely interrupted.

67
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,690
Sweet sneaks, Aarons.

68
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,997
You wear your sisters'
hand-me-down underwear too?

I hope you had a great summer.

Mrs. Myers, this is Leslie Burke,
who will be joining your class.

73

- Leslie, welcome to Lark Creek.
- Thanks.

00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:05,016
- Thank you, Principal Turner.
- [Class whispering]

75
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,219
[Myers] Well, Leslie, um,
you'll sit at my desk this morning,

76
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:11,457
until we can figure out
where to squeeze you in.

[Exhales] I like to start the year
with a little fun.

79

I want you all to write a one-page
essay about your favorite hobby.

80

- [Class groans]
- [Myers] Yes?

81
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:27,436
Mrs. Myers, when you say one page,
did you mean both sides of the paper?

82
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,812
- [Myers] You can do one side, Madison.
- [Madison] I'll do two.

83
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:34,148
- [Janice] Yeah, that's cool.
- [Girl 1] No way!

84
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,087
- [Girl 2] It was so amazing.
- [Girl 3] Can I have this?

85
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:40,489
You could have two bucks out of it all.
I'm getting most of it, OK?

86
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,259
- Excuse me.
- Got a dollar?

87
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,560
- No.
- You're gonna have to use your pants.

88
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,291
- What's your problem?
- You got that backwards.

89

- You got the problem.
- [Girl] That's right, new girl.

90

- Nice feet.
- You say something?

91
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,778
What I said was,

92
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:03,304
have you ever heard the story
about the trolls under the bridges

93
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,816
who collect tolls
from unlucky travelers?

94
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,944

What is she talking about?

Hey, Jess, right?

- See you tomorrow.
- Ten seconds, ace.

120
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,384
Thank you.

121
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:33,262
Are you following me?

122
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,197
No. I live over there.

123
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:38,168
[May Belle] We're neighbors?
You got little sisters?

124
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:41,138
- No. Just me.
- Oh.

125
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,072
You got any Barbies?

126
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,607
Yeah. I think I have a few.
You got any?

127
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,775
- Yeah, I have one... and a half.
- And a half?

128
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,081
One got cut in half
playing Super Extreme Barbies.

129
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,586
Never heard of that before.

130
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,623
You flush the toilet
with them in it,

131
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,386
drop them from the upstairs window,
stuff like that.

132
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,622
- It's really fun.
- Sounds like fun.

133
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:07,257
- Well, I'll see you around.
- Yeah. See ya.

134
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,630
- See ya.
- Hey, guys.

135

See ya.

138

[Mom] There we go.
This'll make it feel better.

139
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,675
- [Brenda] How come it's my fault?
- When I ask you to watch the baby,

140
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,342
- I mean watch the baby, Brenda.
- It's Ellie's turn.

141
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,353
- I'm doing my algebra.
- [Mom] Put more cream on there.

142
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,855
You girls have to start
helping out more here.

143
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,584
You're not little kids anymore.

144
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,364
May Belle! How many times have
I told you, stay out of my stuff.

145
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,497
- It wasn't me.
- It was too you.

146
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,269
- You can't prove it!
- [Dad] There a problem here?

147
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,640
- Daddy!
- Hey, sweetie.

148
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,907
Is he picking on you?

149
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,774
- She was in my stuff.
- What stuff?

150
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,889
How'd that race go?

151
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:12,522
[May Belle] There's this new girl
moved in next door.

152
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:15,863
She beat all of the boys.
Even Jess.

153
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:22,202
Make sure you take out
the garbage before supper.

154
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:25,535
One drop.

155
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:29,047
And that's the magic.
Here comes May Belle's flowers.

156
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,673
Are these ever gonna grow?

157
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:36,188
[Dad] This greenhouse is gonna be filled
with your purple flowers.

158
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,247
May Belle's flowers.

159
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:43,559
[May Belle] I always wanted the one
that had, like, purple all over it.

160
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,388
They are so cool.

161
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,934
- These things are gonna grow fast.
- Me too.

162
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,869
- [Dad] Tomorrow, it's gonna be filled.
- [May Belle] Yeah.

163
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,135
- [Bell rings]
- [Girl] The bell's gonna ring!

164
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,666
- Good morning, everybody!
- Good morning, Ms. Edmunds!

165
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,804
Aren't you glad
that summer's over?

166
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:05,339
- [All] No!
- No? I am.

167

00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,551
- Can I play the woodblock?
- Yes.

169
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,085
[Girl] Ms. Edmunds?
May I please play the castanets?

170
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,391
Yes, you may.
Everybody ready for music?

171
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,625

[Myers] I wanna share
this composition for two reasons.

192
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,844
One, it uses adjectives well.
And two,

193
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:28,690
it's clear the author paid attention
to what she saw and what she felt,

194
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,253
which is important for any writing.

196
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,333
Leslie, why don't you read it for us.

197
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,735
Oh, man. Can you believe this?

198
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,149
"I'm moving gently forward,

199
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,789
over the wild and beautiful,
unexplored world below me.

00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,355
I'm floating in silence,

201
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,458
and breaking it up
with the sound of my breath.

202
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:08,466
Above me, there's nothing
but shimmery light,

203
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,525
the place where I've come from,

204
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:13,070
and will go back to
when I am done here.

205
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,572
I'm diving.

206
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,303
I'm a scuba diver.

207
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:21,938
I'm going deeper past
the wrinkled rocks and dark seaweed

208
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:26,075
toward a deep blueness
where a school of silver fish wait.

209
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:30,082
As I swim through the water,

210
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,783
bubbles burst from me,

211
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:35,759
wobbling like little jellyfish
as they rise.

212
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,796
I check my air.

213
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:40,832
I don't have as much time
as I need to see everything,

214
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,697

00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,644
What if you can't watch this program?

220
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:04,314
Inform your parents it's an assignment,
I'm sure they won't object.

221
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,450
But... what if you don't have a TV?

[All laugh]

223
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,693
My dad says the TV
kills your brain cells.

224
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:21,069
Your dad doesn't know anything.
We watch TV, like, every day.

225
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,370
- I rest my case.
- [Myers] Well, then, Leslie,

226
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:27,378
you don't have to write this essay.
Pick something else to write about.

227
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:30,040
- Yeah, like, how to live in a cave.
- [Class laughs]

228
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,276
[Myers] That's enough, Mr. Hoager.

229

Hey, Leslie, come here.

230
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,356
What are you gonna write your essay on?
Bats in caves?

231

- [Girl] Here comes Janice!
- [Boy] New kid's in Janice's seat.

- Jess! The big kids will kill her!

That's right, beanpole. Move it.
Out of my way, farm boy.

235
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,511
You're really asking for it.

236
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,708
Seems to me she gives it out
whether you ask for it or not.

237
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,944
So might as well have some fun.

238
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:43,749
Getting Janice all wound up
is a weird way of having fun.

239
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:48,257
Well, what's your idea of having fun?

240
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,188
- I don't know.
- Well, you wanna do something?

241
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,424
- I don't know.
- Let's do something. Definitely.

242
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,797
- What?
- You can't do it.

243
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,666
- Do what?
- What we're doing.

244
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:07,110
Hey, May Belle!
I don't use my Barbies anymore.

245
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:10,444
- If you want, you can have them.
- To keep for permanent?

246
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,484
- Sure.
- Thanks.

247
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:16,915
You're lucky to have a sister.

248
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,856
I've got four, and I'd
trade them all for a good dog.

249
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,291
I'd love to have a dog.

250
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,659

she changes her mind.

260
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,844
I've never gone scuba diving
in my whole life.

00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:23,744

- No. I made it up.

It's different from lying.

263

you seen those things yourself?

No, but...

Yeah, but when we go back to school,
there they are waiting.

just not being at school.

Hey, don't you think
we should give her a hand?

340
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,368
Uh... She's... She's fine.

341
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,369

343
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:12,513
OK.

344
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,443
[Girl 1] Remember to bring your bag.

345
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,989
[Girl 2] Why would anyone
want to wear that?

- You OK?
- What's the problem?

349
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:30,596
- Jess Aarons tripped me.
- Uh...

350
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:32,727
[Janice] On purpose.

351
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:35,398
OK, Aarons. Hit the road.

352
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,839
- But he didn't do anything.
- [Driver] Go.

353
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:42,641
- It was definitely him.
- I know.

354
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:02,193
- What happened to you?
- Janice is a very talented person.

355
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:05,100
She can shoot ketchup packets
over four rows of seats.

356
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,933
[Chuckles] Jeez.

357
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:10,432
Can I wash up at your house?
My mom sees this, she'll be all over

Why would Dad do this?

00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,753
Mom, this is Leslie.

362
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,687
- [Mom] Hi, Leslie.
- [Leslie] Hi.

363
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:28,453
- It's nice to meet you.
- Thank you. You too.

364
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:32,188
So are you and your family
getting settled in OK?

365
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:35,664
- Yes, ma'am.
- That's nice.

368
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:47,940
- [Jess] Where's your dad work?
- [Leslie] At home. Same as my mom.

369

- They're writers.
- [Jess] Writers?

370
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:53,275
- What do they write about?
- Fiction.

371
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,978
That explains you.

372
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:59,890
- What do you mean?
- Well, you like to make things up.

373
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:02,449
And that's what your parents
do for a living.

374
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:06,456
You know a lot about hardware?

375
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,465
No. Why?

376
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:12,094
Well, your dad works
at a hardware store.

377
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,831
OK.

378
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:17,035
All I'm saying is that
you are who you are...

379
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:18,769
...not your parents.

380
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,840
If they work at your house, you must
get to hang out with them a lot.

381
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,382
Not really.

What's that?

384
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:36,558
- Grenade.

- Squogre.
- Squogre!

390
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:54,201
The sneaky foot soldiers
of the Dark Master.

391
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,576
- They're attacking!
- We need ammo!

392
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:07,348
This is not good.

393
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,752

the whole kingdom from up here.

Isn't this cool?
We can do anything here.

403

Look at it.

404

It's all ours.

- What am I looking for exactly?
- You'll see.

407
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:13,657
Just close your eyes...

408
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,488
...but keep your mind wide open.

- No, it isn't.

00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,158
- I love it.
- How? It doesn't even work.

424
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,993
I don't think we have
the hang of it yet, Dad.

425
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:31,126
You know what? Keep the box.
We'll see if we can take it back.

426
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,629
Daddy, there's something
in the greenhouse.

427
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:44,879
That's the last thing I need,
some animal chewing it's way in here.

428
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:48,249
What are you going to do
if you catch it?

429
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:50,617
These vegetables are our livelihood.

430
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:53,885
Can't afford to share them
with animals that get in here.

431
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,760
- So, you're gonna kill it?
- Have to.

432
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:03,595
Well, he's not gonna
get in here now, right, Dad?

433
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:07,365
Hope not. But if he does,
you just let me deal with it.

434
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:11,070
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

435
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:14,873
No, why don't you go on and do
your homework, I'll clean this mess up.

I heard it was
your birthday yesterday.

- Like it?
- Wow.

439
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,299
It must've cost a fortune.

440
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:49,039
What's it matter what it costs?

441
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,243
I don't know.

442
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,751
Well, I can take it back
and get a cheaper one, if you want.

443
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:59,513

Hey, here he comes.

448
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:21,936
And a guy who can stand up to a squogre
is scared of a Hoager?

- Can I help you with those?

You sure can.
And you just made my day.

How come you're so good at that?

- Good at what?
- Building stuff.

457
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:02,509
You're good at it for a girl.

458
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:05,488
Same way I'm fast... for a girl.

459

You know what I mean.

460

You're pretty good at art... for a boy.

OK, OK, truce.

this stuff's missing?

It's a giant troll!

No, it's a giant tree
that almost killed us!

469
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:48,187
You think that tree
just fell all by itself?

470
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,525
Come on.

471
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:54,037
When the Dark Master saw
the squogres weren't scaring us away,

472
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:57,597
- he sent a giant troll.
- How big?

473

[Leslie] That's how big its feet are.

- You really think so?
- What else could it be?

What should we do?

476
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:23,498
If we had a troll hunter, we could
track its scent and sneak up on it.

What do you think you're doing?

485
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:30,156
- I took care of it for you.
- Did you, now? Now, how'd you do that?

486
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:33,135
I took him into the forest.
He's not coming back, promise.

Did he tell you he's gonna
stay the hell out of the greenhouse?

488
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,131
No, he went out there
and he's not coming...

489
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,474
Jess, you need to understand
something, OK?

490
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:45,413
This is not one of your cartoons. This
is just a pest that eats up our food,

money we earn and time we don't have.

492

- OK.
- Get your head out of the clouds

493

00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,953

Are we slaying the giant troll
after school today?

You've got your head
in the clouds, Leslie.

- Huh?
- There is no giant troll, all right?

00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,071
Neither one squished, 'cause I
didn't put them next to my drink.

509
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,974
I'd shut up about those Twinkies.

510
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:23,809
You're just mad 'cause I
got some and you didn't.

511
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:26,145
Whatever. Don't cry to me
when you lose them.

512
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:27,775

- She's there. What are you gonna do?

516
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:46,630
And she makes you pay to pee!

517
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:49,733
It's a dollar, shorty.

518
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:53,504
But I don't have a dollar.

519
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:57,138
That's not fair, is it?
Peeing's definitely supposed to be free.

520
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:58,579
Free to pee!

521
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:01,846

What Twinkies, Twinkie?

527

You're supposed to beat her up.
You're my brother!

528

Do you know what would happen
if I were to pick a fight with her?

529

- You'll get your butt kicked.
- [Girls laugh]

530

No, I'd get kicked out of school for
fighting a girl. What's that prove?

ride Janice home today.

- [Boy] What are you talking about?
- Willard and Janice.

Well, you better tell Willard that.

we can watch it catch fire.

That's an artist's hand. Am I right?

[Leslie] Her dad gets really mad at her.

677
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:41,247
[Jess] So? My dad gets mad at me...
pretty much all the time.

678
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:43,582
- [Leslie] He hits her.
- [Jess] Oh.

679
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:47,646
[Leslie] Some neighbor heard them
yelling so loud, they called the police.

680
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:51,854
And it got out. And all the seventh
and the eighth graders know about it.

681
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:57,093
- Whoa.
- Which explains, like, a lot.

682
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:02,400
Well, what did you say to her?

683
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:05,999
Well, I told her about not having a TV

684
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,976
and everyone laughing at me.

685
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:11,036
I know what it's like
to have everyone think I was weird.

686
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:13,105
Then what'd she say?

687
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:15,344
She asked me for advice.

688
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:18,420
Janice Avery asked you for advice?

689
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:20,888
- Yeah.
- And?

690
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:23,357
Well, I told her just to pretend

691
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:26,554
that she had no idea
what anyone was talking about,

692
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:31,431
and in a few weeks' time,
everybody would just forget about it.

- Man...

694
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,097
Then I gave her a piece of gum.

695
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:38,532
- We should go.
- Yeah.

696
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:42,672
- [Leslie] Wanna come back tomorrow?
- [Jess] Can't. I got chores.

697
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:45,613
- How about the next day?
- Sunday we go to church.

698
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:47,741
- Can I come?
- You'd hate it.

699
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:51,344
- No, I think it'd be cool.
- Uh, girls can't wear pants.

700
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:55,790
- I've got dresses, Jess.
- You in a dress? That'd be a sight!

It's not interesting.
It's scary!

709

It's nailing holes through your hands.

710

It's 'cause we're all vile sinners.
God made Jesus die.

That's right, huh, Jess?

00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:36,219
God damns you to hell

- [Leslie] Well, I don't think so.

goes around damning people to hell.

- I put the drill down here.

[Jess] It's amazing how much
detail's put into it.

847
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:20,125
You've been to a museum before, right?

848
01:08:20,196 --> 01:08:23,632
- No, it's my first time.
- Really?

849
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:26,429
- Yup.
- Well, then I'm honored.

850
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:07,839
[Edmunds] It's such a nice day out.

851
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:12,210
It's been raining so much, I began
to think it was like that Japanese myth

852
01:09:12,281 --> 01:09:16,274
where the sun goes into the cave
and vows never to come out.

853
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:19,583
- You know about everything.
- Not by a long shot.

854
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:21,680
But I do try to keep an open mind,

855
01:09:21,757 --> 01:09:24,351
and you'd be surprised
what finds its way in there.

856
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:28,089
That's what Leslie Burke says.
She told me to keep my mind wide open.

857
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:29,825
[Edmunds] Leslie Burke is right.

858
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:33,562
Mind like yours wide open,
you could create a whole new world.

859
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:45,311
- Thank you very much.
- You're very welcome.

860
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:49,010
- Maybe we could do this again sometime.
- Absolutely.

861
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:56,290
- Hey, guys.
- [May Belle] See? I told you.

862
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:58,417
[Sobbing] Oh, my God, Jess!

863
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:03,360
- Where in God's name have you been?
- Where have you been?

864
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:06,865
Mom...

865
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:09,427
I asked you. It wasn't like I...

866
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:12,201
- They thought you were dead.
- Brenda, hush.

867
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:14,071
Dead?

868
01:10:15,277 --> 01:10:17,040
What's going on?

869
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:26,219
Your friend Leslie's dead.

870
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:29,888
She drowned in a creek this morning.

871
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:33,588
Apparently she tried to swing
across on a rope and it broke.

872
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:35,892
They think she hit her head.

873
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:41,191
No... No, it's not that kind of rope.

874
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:44,899
It couldn't break.
It... wouldn't have.

875
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:46,999
But it did.

876
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:53,908
- I'm sorry, son.
- No, you're lying.

877
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:58,844
- She's not even dead. You're lying!
- Jess! [sobbing]

878
01:10:58,921 --> 01:10:59,910
[Screen door slams]

879
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:07,853
- [Panting]
- [Indistinct radio chatter]

880
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:31,371
[Girls chattering indistinctly]

881
01:12:33,148 --> 01:12:36,413
Hi, honey. You want some breakfast?

882
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:39,249
I... I gotta do my chores first.

883
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:42,085
Your dad's doing everything today.
You just sit down.

884
01:12:58,107 --> 01:12:59,870
Jess, your father and I thought

885
01:12:59,942 --> 01:13:02,604
we'd go to the Burkes today
and pay our respects.

886
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:05,010
Just the three of us.

887
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:07,481
Paying what?

888
01:13:28,937 --> 01:13:30,700
Prince Terrien. Shh.

889
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:33,541
You must be Jess.

890
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:47,484
I'm Mr. Aarons. This is my wife, Mary.
Very sorry about your loss.

891
01:13:47,556 --> 01:13:50,081
- I'm so sorry.
- Hi, Jess.

892
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,091
She loved you, you know.

893
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:02,593
You know, Leslie,

894
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:06,630
she never had much luck
making friends at her old school.

895
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:10,041
We were hoping that when
we moved out here she would...

896
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:16,717
[whispering] She said
if it wasn't for you...

897
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:21,385
You're the best friend she's ever had.

898
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,425
I wanna thank you for that.

899
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:26,986
You're welcome.

900
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:33,090
[Dad] My wife and I were wondering
about the service.

901
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:40,233
We've decided to bring Leslie
back home until the service.

902
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:49,974
- [Edmunds] Jess.
- Next time,

903
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:53,044
we should invite Leslie to go.

904
01:14:54,923 --> 01:14:57,118
She'd like that.

905
01:15:06,602 --> 01:15:08,126
Hey, kid.

906
01:15:09,571 --> 01:15:11,732
Sorry about your friend.

907
01:15:14,209 --> 01:15:18,737
[Myers] The purpose
of object pronouns...

908
01:15:18,814 --> 01:15:21,942
So looks like you're
the fastest kid in the class now, huh?

909
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:26,412
It's a joke, dude.

910
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:29,481
[Grunts, screams]

911
01:15:30,993 --> 01:15:33,018
- Are you nuts?
- Jess Aarons.

912
01:15:33,629 --> 01:15:35,722
Go wait for me out in the hall.

913
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:39,599
Silent reading until I get back.

914
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:42,660
[All chattering]

915
01:15:48,977 --> 01:15:50,706
Jess...

916
01:15:57,386 --> 01:16:00,287
When my husband died...

917
01:16:00,355 --> 01:16:03,347
...people kept telling me not to cry.

918
01:16:04,459 --> 01:16:06,859
People kept trying to help me to forget.

919
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:12,497
But I didn't wanna forget. [sniffles]

920
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:14,900
Excuse me.

921
01:16:17,673 --> 01:16:20,267
The things that girl came up with.

922
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:24,905
I don't get students like her too often.

923
01:16:29,484 --> 01:16:31,952
So I realize...

924
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:34,750
...that if it's hard for me...

925
01:16:34,823 --> 01:16:37,348
...how much harder it must be for you.

926
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:50,695
[# Someday]

927
01:17:17,232 --> 01:17:19,666
[Grunts]

928
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:27,134
[Boy] Hurry up.
We're gonna miss the bus!

929
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:38,281
Hey.

930
01:17:59,074 --> 01:18:01,406
[Panting]

931
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:27,526
Leslie?!

932
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:35,100
[Chimes rattling]

933
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:54,387
[Girl] Jess!

934
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,987
Leslie!

935
01:18:56,064 --> 01:18:59,500
- Jess!
- Leslie!

936
01:19:05,974 --> 01:19:07,601
Lesl...

937
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:10,668
Help me, I can't get across! Hurry!

938
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,848
May Belle?

939
01:19:16,284 --> 01:19:18,479
- Hold on! Don't move!
- [Gasping]

940
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:22,613
Here, grab my arm.
I got you, don't worry.

941
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:30,523
- What were you thinking?
- I was worried about you!

942
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:33,397
Well, don't be. I don't want you here!

943
01:19:34,002 --> 01:19:36,800
- But I wanna come with you.
- This is our place. Go home.

944
01:19:36,872 --> 01:19:38,737
This is our place!

945
01:19:42,878 --> 01:19:44,243
I said go home!

946
01:19:59,361 --> 01:20:01,226
Honey, what's the matter?

947
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:04,165
What's the matter?

948
01:20:04,232 --> 01:20:06,166
- What's the matter, baby?
- [Sniffing]

949
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:43,061
- [Chimes jingling]
- [Grunting]

950
01:21:10,832 --> 01:21:12,561
No!

951
01:21:14,135 --> 01:21:15,864
Jess!

952
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:19,636
It's OK, Jess.
It's OK, son, it's OK.

953
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:21,505
It's all gone.

954
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:27,448
Is it like the Bible says?

955
01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:29,415
Is she going to hell?

956
01:21:30,118 --> 01:21:31,915
I don't know everything about God,

957
01:21:31,987 --> 01:21:34,854
but I do know He's not
gonna send that little girl to hell.

958
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:38,290
Then I'm going to hell
because it's all my fault.

959
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:42,057
Don't you think that even for a minute.

960
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:44,758
But it is.

961
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:49,065
I didn't invite her
to go to the museum with me.

962
01:21:49,137 --> 01:21:52,470
I didn't wanna invite her.

963
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:55,839
I wasn't there to go with her.

964
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:59,039
- It's my fault.
- No, no, no, no.

965
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:01,275
It's not your fault.

966
01:22:01,349 --> 01:22:03,977
None of that makes it so.

967
01:22:04,052 --> 01:22:06,247
It's a terrible thing.

968
01:22:06,321 --> 01:22:10,951
It doesn't make any sense,
but it's not your fault, Jess.

969
01:22:15,997 --> 01:22:19,660
She brought you something special
when she came here, didn't she?

970
01:22:22,837 --> 01:22:25,237
That's what you hold on to.

971
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:30,801
That's how you keep her alive.

972
01:22:51,066 --> 01:22:52,397
May Belle?

973
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:02,507
Look.

974
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:06,177
I'm sorry I pushed you.

975
01:23:08,383 --> 01:23:11,648
That was stupid and wrong...

976
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:15,848
...and I really miss you talking to me.

977
01:23:56,264 --> 01:23:58,698
She's in your hands now.

978
01:24:21,956 --> 01:24:23,082
Hey!

979
01:24:24,926 --> 01:24:26,188
Wait!

980
01:24:28,263 --> 01:24:29,287
Wait!

981
01:24:31,599 --> 01:24:32,998
Hey!

982
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:42,000
Jess? I'm sorry.
I didn't... I didn't see you.

983
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:45,843
Can I use the lumber by your house?

984
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:47,609
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

985
01:24:47,682 --> 01:24:50,412
Anything you see, you just...

986
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:54,653
You know, I meant to...
I meant to give you Prince Terrien,

987
01:24:54,722 --> 01:24:57,953
but I... can't seem to give him up.

988
01:24:59,794 --> 01:25:01,853
Leslie would've wanted you to have him.

989
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:03,488
Yeah.

990
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:30,252
[Grunts]

991
01:26:26,981 --> 01:26:30,348
We're playing. By ourselves.

992
01:26:31,886 --> 01:26:35,845
OK, but I know the most
incredible place to play.

993
01:26:35,924 --> 01:26:38,984
You gotta promise you're
not gonna tell anybody about it.

994
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:43,190
Not Brenda, not Ellie, not even Joycie.

995
01:26:43,264 --> 01:26:46,859
Tell Joycie a secret between you and me?

996
01:26:46,935 --> 01:26:48,459
She's nothing but a baby.

997
01:26:48,536 --> 01:26:51,801
You're right, and she's not ready
to be a princess yet.

998
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:53,738
You have to train her and stuff.

999
01:26:53,808 --> 01:26:56,834
Princess? Who gets to be the princess?

1000
01:27:06,621 --> 01:27:08,350
Step down.

1001
01:27:11,826 --> 01:27:13,225
Watch your step.

1002
01:27:20,768 --> 01:27:22,565
You're not peeking, are you?

1003
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:27,470
Step up. There you go.

1004
01:27:34,882 --> 01:27:36,679
All right.

1005
01:27:43,124 --> 01:27:45,092
OK. Open them.

1006
01:27:50,865 --> 01:27:54,926
Wow. Did you make this?

1007
01:27:56,371 --> 01:27:58,066
Yep.

1008
01:28:00,908 --> 01:28:02,705
Hold on a second.

1009
01:28:11,386 --> 01:28:14,753
Look! They must've heard the rumor,

1010
01:28:14,822 --> 01:28:19,589
that the beautiful girl arriving today
is the new future ruler of Terabithia.

1011
01:28:19,661 --> 01:28:22,994
- Who heard?
- The Terabithians.

1012
01:28:23,064 --> 01:28:25,328
They've been waiting.

1013
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:27,391
Where?

1014
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:30,926
- I don't see them.
- It's an ancient forest, May Belle,

1015
01:28:31,005 --> 01:28:33,405
full of magical creatures
and friendly giants,

1016
01:28:33,474 --> 01:28:35,772
anything you can imagine.

1017
01:28:35,843 --> 01:28:37,811
But you gotta look really hard.

1018
01:28:37,879 --> 01:28:40,780
But keep your mind wide open.

1019
01:28:49,424 --> 01:28:51,255
So, what do you think?

1020
01:28:55,663 --> 01:28:58,097
Can there be purple flowers?

1021
01:29:00,201 --> 01:29:02,635
[Jess] Anything you want.

1022
01:29:03,604 --> 01:29:05,595
[May Belle] Wow.

1023
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:08,305
And a castle.

1024
01:29:08,376 --> 01:29:11,174
A big one, with towers and flags.

1025
01:29:11,245 --> 01:29:13,577
[Jess] Of course.

1026
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:19,217
[May Belle] Look, Jess. It's beautiful.

1027
01:29:23,124 --> 01:29:24,819
Is there a king?

1028
01:29:24,892 --> 01:29:26,325
Are you the king, Jess?

1029
01:29:26,394 --> 01:29:28,988
Only if you're princess.

1030
01:29:44,612 --> 01:29:47,706
[All clapping]

1031
01:30:14,575 --> 01:30:16,941
Terabithia.
