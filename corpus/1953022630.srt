1
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,589
Should have stayed in Missouri.

2
00:01:06,683 --> 00:01:10,495
You shut up with that.
You Wanted to come.

3
00:01:13,256 --> 00:01:15,566
I say we do it now.

4
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:16,762
I don't like it, neither.

5
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,239
But We about run out.

6
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,436
She didn't want her boy to starve.

7
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:25,206
It ain't your place.

8
00:01:25,301 --> 00:01:28,612
It's already decided.
We can always go back.

9
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,210
Fine.

10
00:01:36,546 --> 00:01:40,084
Then I'm doing
what I goddamn got to do.

11
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,538
Be strong.

12
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,803
She's in heaven.

13
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,817
Pop, I'm hungry.

14
00:02:17,253 --> 00:02:19,324
Not too deep.

15
00:02:29,432 --> 00:02:31,105
Come on.

16
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,426
How is he?

17
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:55,765
What you'd imagine.

18
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:04,673
How long are We supposed to Wait?

19
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,373
He'll be back. Maybe with food.

20
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,744
We Wait.

21
00:03:08,838 --> 00:03:10,215
How long?

22
00:03:10,306 --> 00:03:12,286
As long as it takes.

23
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,615
I ain't talking to you!

24
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,748
Hey! We got to stick together
and think smart,

25
00:03:16,846 --> 00:03:18,757
or we'll everyone of us be dead.

26
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,796
Shut up, old man.

27
00:03:31,394 --> 00:03:33,897
Donner?

28
00:03:33,997 --> 00:03:36,637
George, is that you?

29
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:43,613
You're still here.

30
00:03:43,706 --> 00:03:45,481
- You made it.
- Lucky me.

31
00:03:45,575 --> 00:03:46,986
I knew you Would!

32
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:50,318
Jed.

33
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:57,792
Got overrun by Indians.

34
00:03:59,722 --> 00:04:01,463
It was a massacre.

35
00:04:01,557 --> 00:04:04,595
Dead, all of them.

36
00:04:04,694 --> 00:04:08,506
I barely made it out.

37
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,508
The four of us are it now.

38
00:04:16,372 --> 00:04:19,251
Find a way out of the valley yet?

39
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,514
Donner, you son of a bitch,

40
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:24,819
you said stay with the damn Wagon.

41
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:32,296
Easy, boy.

42
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,834
Maybe this will put you in a better humor.

43
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,734
Got me a raccoon

44
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:45,908
Can you believe it?

45
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:57,985
George. George!

46
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,464
I'm going to make you last a While.

47
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:32,109
He killed them all.

48
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,442
Ate them alive.

49
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,848
Dormer party--the whole thing--
it wasn't an accident.

50
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,853
George Donner brought them up
there on purpose.

51
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,355
There's an ancient curse
in those mountains.

52
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:49,794
If you eat human flesh--
living, human flesh--

53
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:53,732
something comes into you, you turn.

54
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:56,030
You absorb their life-force.

55
00:07:57,527 --> 00:07:59,097
Then you need more.

56
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:01,801
You crave it.

57
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,434
Donner had already been turned.

58
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:05,206
He had the hunger.

59
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:08,111
They say he's still up here.

60
00:08:08,204 --> 00:08:10,878
Still hunting.

61
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:17,389
Okay So if I out my finger
and you sucked my blood--

62
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,857
No, I might have to take a nibble.

63
00:08:18,948 --> 00:08:21,690
Okay. So you ate my finger,

64
00:08:21,784 --> 00:08:25,926
then you would turn
and absorb my life-force?

65
00:08:26,022 --> 00:08:27,592
We're not in Donner country yet.

66
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,500
So I guess you'll have
to Wait for me to eat you.

67
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,741
Gross! Thanks for the visual.

68
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:34,967
You do know in reality,

69
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:36,509
George Dormer died that winter, right?

70
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,510
I mean, most of them actually survived.

71
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,911
But they didn't kill anyone on purpose.

72
00:08:41,003 --> 00:08:42,812
And definitely nobody got eaten alive.

73
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:44,407
How do you know? Were you there?

74
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:45,952
I did a report about it in the 8th grade.

75
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:49,114
You know, a lot of people
up here believe that legend.

76
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:51,818
They think Donner's real.

77
00:08:51,914 --> 00:08:54,087
Sure. And half the people
in Iceland still believe gnomes

78
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:55,719
Okay. Now, we're talking about gnomes?

79
00:08:55,818 --> 00:08:58,025
This conversation
is officially really stupid.

80
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,760
Music. Music's a good call.
Where are the CDs?

81
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:03,063
Under the seat.

82
00:09:04,227 --> 00:09:05,706
Bear repellant?

83
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,741
My dad makes me carry that.

84
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,571
I guess you might run into
a bear out on the slopes.

85
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:13,636
Well, it Works just as Well
on carjackers and assholes.

86
00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:15,147
I guess I'll have to behave myself.

87
00:09:15,238 --> 00:09:16,148
I guess so.

88
00:11:35,411 --> 00:11:37,652
Why are We stopping?

89
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:39,351
Deer and Ale.

90
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,189
Oh, God! I hate that place.

91
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,921
Since when?

92
00:11:43,018 --> 00:11:44,929
Your parents always stop here.
It's tradition.

93
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,000
Exactly.

94
00:11:55,364 --> 00:11:57,776
I've been Wanting to do that for two hours.

95
00:11:57,867 --> 00:11:59,847
We're finally getting our Weekend.

96
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:02,211
Didn't I tell you
I would make this happen.

97
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:05,217
Well, you have to give Thomas
a little credit for inviting us up.

98
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:08,754
I do. You're right.

99
00:12:25,795 --> 00:12:28,332
My God, best ribs ever!

100
00:12:28,431 --> 00:12:31,878
Jesus, get a room.

101
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:34,345
I don't think they make enough
napkins to deal with this,

102
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:37,418
so I'll be right back.

103
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,746
How's everything here?

104
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:39,911
Couldn't be better.

105
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,215
Great.

106
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,347
Where do I know you from?

107
00:12:43,446 --> 00:12:45,187
Maydo High, right? You Went to Ma;Maydo.

108
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:46,783
No.

109
00:12:46,882 --> 00:12:48,793
Sorry.

110
00:12:48,884 --> 00:12:51,091
Just holler if you need anything.

111
00:12:53,823 --> 00:12:56,394
Bored?

112
00:12:58,227 --> 00:12:59,934
No.

113
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,942
Do you snowboard?

114
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:06,337
Ski. Cross country, actually.

115
00:13:06,435 --> 00:13:09,177
Really? I love cross country.

116
00:13:09,271 --> 00:13:11,751
Yeah, all those people
on the slopes, it's just--

117
00:13:11,841 --> 00:13:15,755
Sometimes when I'm on a lift
and I'm looking down,

118
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:17,449
and they look like ants,

119
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,686
I think, what it would be like
if they actually had to hike up

120
00:13:20,783 --> 00:13:22,262
before they could ski down.

121
00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:25,161
There would be, like, four people,
which I'd like a lot better.

122
00:13:25,254 --> 00:13:27,325
Yeah. Me, too actually.

123
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,465
Should We sing "Kumbayah" now'?

124
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,004
Oh, Wait. Better--

125
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:35,735
you guys sing,
and I'll go to the bathroom.

126
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:37,811
I'll go with you.

127
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,191
Thomas.

128
00:14:01,557 --> 00:14:04,037
What's Wrong?

129
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:06,572
Nothing.

130
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,071
Nicole's a bitch, okay?

131
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:14,238
Everyone knows it.

132
00:14:14,336 --> 00:14:18,751
I don't know how Kayley deals with her,
even if they are cousins.

133
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:21,287
Look, you just got to put her
on the payroll.

134
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:23,983
What?

135
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,320
Put her on the payroll.

136
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:32,331
See, after this Weekend
at your cabin, she'll owe you.

137
00:14:32,421 --> 00:14:34,867
At Woodside,
it's all about who you Know.

138
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,437
Knowing her is a good thing.

139
00:14:37,526 --> 00:14:39,233
You don't even have to be friends.

140
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:42,400
Just let the situation Work for you,

141
00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:45,240
and then she's on the payroll.
You know what I mean?

142
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:49,772
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

143
00:14:49,872 --> 00:14:53,945
Trust me, I transferred in here
two years ago myself.

144
00:14:54,043 --> 00:14:55,852
I know what it's like.

145
00:14:55,945 --> 00:14:58,653
Watch and learn, grasshopper

146
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,787
You have to be nice to him.

147
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:04,228
I'm being nice.

148
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,891
Look. I'm only here so your
parents would let you come.

149
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,366
Come on! Be fair.

150
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:10,994
I Went to fucking Cabo
with you for a Week,

151
00:15:11,093 --> 00:15:13,835
and I didn't tell your parents
or my parents anything.

152
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:15,374
You had fun.

153
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:20,172
No, you had fun.

154
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:22,875
I got to hold your hair back
from the toilet.

155
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:25,475
You owe me, and you Know it.

156
00:15:25,574 --> 00:15:26,814
Fine.

157
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:28,183
Fine.

158
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:34,527
He's a loser.

159
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:37,154
Just treat him like a human being.

160
00:15:37,252 --> 00:15:40,256
That's not too much to ask.

161
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:49,172
Man, what's up with this traffic?

162
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,605
Hey, Thomas, can you see
anything out your side?

163
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,149
Close the window! it's freezing!

164
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,922
There's a chain control stop up ahead.

165
00:16:12,488 --> 00:16:14,024
Ever put on chains before?

166
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,463
I have. I can help.

167
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,232
Sweet. I got to Wiz.

168
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:27,978
So how long have you known Mike?

169
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,346
Gosh. Known him?

170
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:31,941
A year and a half, I guess.

171
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,544
We've been dating for, like, three months.

172
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,647
Cool.

173
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:39,225
What?

174
00:16:39,314 --> 00:16:42,261
Nothing. I just didn't know
you guys were together.

175
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:43,523
He didn't mention it?

176
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:46,395
Nah, he just said he had
a friend with a oar.

177
00:16:46,488 --> 00:16:48,024
Are these them?

178
00:16:48,123 --> 00:16:49,966
Yeah.

179
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:51,436
Thanks.

180
00:16:56,031 --> 00:16:57,977
Whoa. Let me put them chains
on for you.

181
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:00,172
60 bucks will get you going
right quick.

182
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,216
60? it's usually 40 tops.

183
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:07,082
It's a bad night tonight. I'll go 50.

184
00:17:07,176 --> 00:17:10,248
Thanks, but I'm good.

185
00:17:16,218 --> 00:17:17,595
You know, most people,

186
00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:19,393
they'd rather stay
in their cars, heater on--

187
00:17:19,488 --> 00:17:22,367
especially with the recent trouble.

188
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,028
Yep.

189
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,539
A gal showed up dead here
a Week back. No shit.

190
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,700
Saw her picture in the news and all.

191
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,369
Cops is looking for a guy.

192
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,311
They say it's for questioning.

193
00:17:34,403 --> 00:17:36,440
Do you want to Know what I think?

194
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:39,109
I think he...

195
00:17:41,744 --> 00:17:45,089
Hey. How's it going?

196
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,423
I was just telling your friends
here to watch out.

197
00:17:48,517 --> 00:17:50,258
A gal got offed here last Week.

198
00:17:50,352 --> 00:17:53,458
Oh, yeah? Maybe Donner got her.

199
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:55,034
Was she eaten?

200
00:17:56,391 --> 00:17:58,200
Where'd you hear that?

201
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,303
That's kind of what I heard too.

202
00:18:03,398 --> 00:18:07,005
I got a buddy who Knows the coroner.

203
00:18:07,102 --> 00:18:09,582
Said it was like some Kind
of animal attack.

204
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:13,585
Insides gone, body all chewed up.

205
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:17,418
She was probably alive for most of it.

206
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,492
But you can't believe
everything you hear.

207
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,566
Y'all have a safe night now.

208
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,033
Asshole!

209
00:18:33,128 --> 00:18:36,268
Locals love to freak out
the Weekend crowd.

210
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,470
Holy shit!

211
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:40,342
James Michael Epstein.

212
00:18:40,435 --> 00:18:42,005
"Mr. Epstein is Wanted
for questioning

213
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:44,175
"by the Truckee county sheriff's
department in regard

214
00:18:44,273 --> 00:18:47,811
to the disappearance of
Ms. Rita Hill, 42, San Mateo."

215
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,355
Let me see that.

216
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,220
This is right near our place.

217
00:18:56,685 --> 00:18:59,359
Hey, buddy I got those for you.

218
00:18:59,454 --> 00:19:01,491
80 bucks ought to get you
on the road right quick.

219
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:05,265
Come on, let's get this done.

220
00:19:07,362 --> 00:19:09,342
Let's do it.

221
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:18,777
Okay. Which way up here?

222
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,552
I'm not sure.

223
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:25,488
You don't Know how to get
to your own cabin?

224
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,616
My dad always drives.

225
00:19:26,715 --> 00:19:29,662
Don't touch me!

226
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,560
Sorry. I didn't mean to.

227
00:19:31,653 --> 00:19:35,226
Whatever.
Just don't fucking touch me, okay?

228
00:19:35,324 --> 00:19:36,394
Nic--

229
00:19:36,491 --> 00:19:37,435
What? He was leaning on me.

230
00:19:37,526 --> 00:19:39,528
I'm sorry.

231
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:51,077
Okay, so it looks like
it's a left on Evergreen Gap

232
00:19:51,173 --> 00:19:54,552
and then your third left onto Toland

233
00:19:54,643 --> 00:19:56,782
And then we're 1683.

234
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:59,359
It's the second driveway
on your right past the gate.

235
00:20:04,219 --> 00:20:06,256
What are you doing, Nicole?

236
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:07,834
Sexting with Derek?

237
00:20:07,923 --> 00:20:11,393
Shut up, dickwad!

238
00:20:35,884 --> 00:20:39,058
Wow! This is your cabin?

239
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,758
Holy shit!

240
00:20:40,856 --> 00:20:42,267
Where's the butler?

241
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:51,965
I'm sorry.

242
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,006
Could you not do that? We just--

243
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:55,871
WE need to not get into everything.

244
00:21:55,964 --> 00:21:57,443
My parents don't Know we're here.

245
00:21:57,532 --> 00:21:59,842
Okay. Fine.

246
00:22:16,718 --> 00:22:17,753
Yeah, I like this one.

247
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:18,957
You think?

248
00:22:25,327 --> 00:22:27,034
Chicago?

249
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:30,110
New York. it's New York.

250
00:22:42,711 --> 00:22:46,454
Okay, guys. History for a pie piece.

251
00:22:46,548 --> 00:22:49,688
"Name the California oil scandal
that resulted

252
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:53,733
in the indictment
of the Secretary of the Interior."

253
00:22:56,925 --> 00:22:58,529
Teapot Dome.

254
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,076
How did you know that?

255
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:05,270
That's why he's my partner.

256
00:23:05,367 --> 00:23:07,643
The boy's got a memory like firetrap

257
00:23:07,736 --> 00:23:08,976
ls this the only thing there is to drink?

258
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:11,017
I'm not going to make it
through this game sober.

259
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,280
My parents keep some liquor
downstairs.

260
00:23:15,377 --> 00:23:16,822
They don't really drink much.

261
00:23:16,912 --> 00:23:20,086
So...maybe We could
just have a little.

262
00:23:20,182 --> 00:23:22,856
They probably wouldn't notice.

263
00:23:25,587 --> 00:23:28,227
No complaints here.

264
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,064
What do you want?

265
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,466
Can I see what there is?

266
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,164
Yeah.

267
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,636
So what do you drink?

268
00:23:37,732 --> 00:23:40,611
I love vodka.
Do you have any mixers?

269
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:56,828
Oh, my God!
What if it's his parents?

270
00:23:56,918 --> 00:23:58,591
He'll be grounded for life.

271
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,166
He said they're in Europe.

272
00:24:00,255 --> 00:24:03,361
Thomas!

273
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,140
What's going on?

274
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,608
Your neighbors?

275
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:14,146
We don't have neighbors.

276
00:24:14,236 --> 00:24:16,409
We should lock the door.

277
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:18,075
Babe!

278
00:24:22,277 --> 00:24:24,348
Oh, Shit.

279
00:24:24,446 --> 00:24:25,982
Can't believe you made it.

280
00:24:27,582 --> 00:24:29,027
Come on, ass-hat!

281
00:24:29,117 --> 00:24:32,587
Jesus Christ! Would you guys stop?

282
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,558
Motherfuckerl

283
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:41,698
Tap out!

284
00:24:43,098 --> 00:24:45,135
Au right.

285
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,213
Fuck!

286
00:24:47,302 --> 00:24:49,839
Tap out means stop, meathead

287
00:24:52,674 --> 00:24:53,880
Why did you bring them?

288
00:24:53,975 --> 00:24:55,921
You said you were bored.
So I brought the party.

289
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:59,049
All right, I got to take a piss.
And it's fucking dire.

290
00:24:59,147 --> 00:25:01,627
And that's the only reason
I let you win, you bitch.

291
00:25:01,716 --> 00:25:03,491
Blow me.

292
00:25:04,653 --> 00:25:07,133
- This okay?
- Hey, so--

293
00:25:07,222 --> 00:25:08,860
Mighty Mike, how's it hanging, bro?

294
00:25:08,957 --> 00:25:12,097
Hey, Kayley.

295
00:25:12,194 --> 00:25:13,434
Mike.

296
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:14,939
Hey, Derek.

297
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,738
Brody, grab the beer.

298
00:25:17,832 --> 00:25:20,005
What the hell?

299
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,707
Look, I didn't
invite those guys. Just Derek.

300
00:25:22,804 --> 00:25:23,908
Thomas said no one else.

301
00:25:24,005 --> 00:25:25,814
He's my boyfriend.

302
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:29,180
This is not what We talked about.

303
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,416
I told you even four people was too much.

304
00:25:31,513 --> 00:25:34,517
It's okay, Thomas. I'll handle it.

305
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,935
Hey, everybody.

306
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:54,639
Look, I know you had a long
drive, but... I'm sorry.

307
00:25:54,736 --> 00:25:56,613
You can't stay here.

308
00:25:56,705 --> 00:26:00,619
Thomas said WE could only have
the four of us up here.

309
00:26:00,709 --> 00:26:03,155
I guess Nicole forgot that or something.

310
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,453
I'm sorry.

311
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:09,028
Too late. The road's closed.

312
00:26:09,117 --> 00:26:12,462
Dude! I got piss all over me!

313
00:26:12,554 --> 00:26:14,693
AJ, I swear to God!

314
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:17,998
It's just Water, baby.

315
00:26:18,093 --> 00:26:19,003
Never know with you.

316
00:26:19,094 --> 00:26:20,300
Brody.

317
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,011
What's up?

318
00:26:28,103 --> 00:26:32,347
Kayley wants us to fuck off.

319
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,078
What?

320
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:39,217
Thomas can only have
the four of us up here.

321
00:26:39,314 --> 00:26:43,558
I'm really sorry.
But you guys have to leave.

322
00:26:44,986 --> 00:26:49,696
Mike, buddy,

323
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:51,668
what's up with this?

324
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,068
Thought We were bros.

325
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:55,198
Well, if the road's closed...

326
00:26:55,297 --> 00:26:56,833
You want us to die out there
in the cold, Kayley?

327
00:26:56,931 --> 00:26:59,502
It's not that. I like you guys.
You know that.

328
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:01,638
It's just We made a promise.

329
00:27:01,736 --> 00:27:03,545
- To who?
- Thomas.

330
00:27:03,638 --> 00:27:05,675
Who the fuck is Thomas?

331
00:27:05,774 --> 00:27:07,515
This- This is Thomas.

332
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:13,821
Thomas--
AJ, Valerie, Brody, Derek.

333
00:27:13,915 --> 00:27:15,553
This is Thomas' place.

334
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,186
I mean, it's his parents' place.

335
00:27:17,285 --> 00:27:19,765
Sweet place, dude.

336
00:27:19,854 --> 00:27:23,358
You, uh, mind if We crash.

337
00:27:27,829 --> 00:27:29,206
What about you, Mike?

338
00:27:33,034 --> 00:27:35,207
You telling us to fuck off too?

339
00:27:35,303 --> 00:27:37,840
That'd hurt my feelings.

340
00:27:41,376 --> 00:27:43,356
I mean, Where else are they going to go?

341
00:27:55,657 --> 00:27:56,863
Well, all right.

342
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:59,837
Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Tom.

343
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,568
Val, you get your fat ass downstairs.

344
00:28:02,664 --> 00:28:04,871
- Fuck you!
- Exactly.

345
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:08,941
So what's the deal tonight?

346
00:28:09,037 --> 00:28:11,540
Dude, the payroll.

347
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:13,585
Just like I said about Nicole.

348
00:28:13,675 --> 00:28:15,120
After this,
these guys will be your friends.

349
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,951
And you want that.
Just roll with it.

350
00:28:17,045 --> 00:28:19,116
This could be the best thing
that ever happened to us.

351
00:28:19,214 --> 00:28:20,784
I mean, to you.

352
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:23,658
Okay? Just take it easy.

353
00:28:23,752 --> 00:28:26,596
Anything goes Wrong,
I'll take care of it.

354
00:28:39,334 --> 00:28:42,474
What's up, man? Nice sweater.

355
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,243
What, did you steal that
from my grandpa?

356
00:28:45,373 --> 00:28:46,943
This is my room.

357
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:50,716
Dude, chill. One dude doesn't
need a bed this big, okay?

358
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,952
The two of us though...

359
00:28:54,048 --> 00:28:55,925
we'll use it.

360
00:28:56,017 --> 00:28:58,088
You know what I mean?

361
00:28:59,788 --> 00:29:01,199
Be careful with the drinks, all right.

362
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:03,530
My parents don't Know we're here.

363
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:05,798
Oh, shit! Watch the beer, bitch!

364
00:29:05,894 --> 00:29:07,066
Didn't you hear the man?

365
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,470
You ducked, pussy. Drink.

366
00:29:41,563 --> 00:29:42,837
No way. That was interference.
She came out.

367
00:29:42,931 --> 00:29:44,877
- Drink, bitch!
- Let's ask the judge.

368
00:29:44,966 --> 00:29:46,877
Mike, your call.

369
00:29:46,968 --> 00:29:48,709
You're the judge?

370
00:29:48,803 --> 00:29:52,114
Snowball was unobstructed.
Throw counts.

371
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:55,950
Fuck you. I can out drink
all you bitches anyway.

372
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,853
Derek, you're up man.
Let's see how you do.

373
00:29:59,247 --> 00:30:02,524
What was I saying? Yeah.

374
00:30:02,617 --> 00:30:04,893
The dude that killed that chick,
fucking rail on him.

375
00:30:04,986 --> 00:30:06,693
Even kill him.
Who's going to say shit?

376
00:30:06,788 --> 00:30:09,132
Fuck yeah. Beat his ass.
Then turn him over to the cops.

377
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,396
Who are they talking about?

378
00:30:10,492 --> 00:30:12,472
The Wanted guy from the flyer.

379
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,369
Epstein. Whatever his name was.

380
00:30:14,462 --> 00:30:17,409
Fuck yeah. Cave his teeth in.

381
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,104
Use this.

382
00:30:21,202 --> 00:30:22,203
Throw it.

383
00:30:22,303 --> 00:30:24,146
Sure, hold on.

384
00:30:25,874 --> 00:30:27,478
Ready?

385
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,885
Fucking serious.

386
00:30:29,978 --> 00:30:32,891
Throw it, hard as you can.

387
00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:34,187
Dude, do it. Nail him.

388
00:30:34,282 --> 00:30:35,818
AJ, shut up!

389
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:40,196
What if I hit you?

390
00:30:40,288 --> 00:30:44,964
Then I'm going to Walk over there
and beat the living shit out of you.

391
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:48,063
Come on, you pussy. You scared?

392
00:30:48,162 --> 00:30:49,368
Guys...

393
00:30:49,464 --> 00:30:51,740
Dude, do it. Knock him out cold.

394
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:53,005
You better hope it does.

395
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,739
Brody, you could fucking take him.

396
00:30:54,836 --> 00:30:58,010
No. Brody's big,
but he's a fucking coward.

397
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,312
Aren't you?

398
00:31:03,878 --> 00:31:06,449
Guys, seriously.

399
00:31:07,982 --> 00:31:09,586
DO it!

400
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,940
That wasn't even fucking close, man!

401
00:31:25,033 --> 00:31:27,070
The master plan.

402
00:31:27,168 --> 00:31:28,943
Easy tiger. Drink up.

403
00:31:29,037 --> 00:31:32,348
Who's next? Mikey. You're up.

404
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,386
My God! Mike, don't.

405
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,614
Fuck it, why not?

406
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,184
AJ, this guy's a rookie.

407
00:31:42,283 --> 00:31:43,785
Fuck yeah. lt'd be my pleasure.

408
00:31:43,885 --> 00:31:46,263
All I have to do is not duck.

409
00:31:46,354 --> 00:31:48,800
No movement of any kind.

410
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,494
Mike, AJ's a pitcher. He's going--

411
00:31:50,592 --> 00:31:53,300
He's drunk.
Nothing to Worry about there.

412
00:31:53,394 --> 00:31:55,567
Bottom of the 9th.

413
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,506
Bases loaded, full count.

414
00:31:59,934 --> 00:32:01,379
Pitcher looks.

415
00:32:03,538 --> 00:32:06,610
Likes the sign.

416
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:08,312
Wind up.

417
00:32:08,409 --> 00:32:09,752
Pitch.

418
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,855
That is the fucking game!

419
00:32:12,947 --> 00:32:14,187
Fuck! That hurt.

420
00:32:14,282 --> 00:32:15,317
- AJ..
- Did you see that?

421
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:16,451
That shit was fucking epic.

422
00:32:16,551 --> 00:32:18,224
AJ, drink.

423
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:20,390
What? No, fuck you. He flinched.

424
00:32:20,488 --> 00:32:22,263
No, he did not flinch.

425
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,634
Drink. Nice, dude. That's balls.

426
00:32:25,727 --> 00:32:27,104
No, no, no. Wait. No, no, no.
Fuck that.

427
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,004
I hit him right between
his fucking eyes.

428
00:32:29,097 --> 00:32:32,840
I know. But he's not
a pussy like you. So drink.

429
00:32:32,934 --> 00:32:34,641
Fuck you!

430
00:32:44,312 --> 00:32:45,290
Did you see that?

431
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,382
Hit the fucking tree
from 40 yards, bitch.

432
00:32:47,482 --> 00:32:50,053
What was that?

433
00:32:53,621 --> 00:32:56,727
Excuse me.
Would you mind not doing that?

434
00:32:56,824 --> 00:32:59,498
When the snow melts, tnere's going to be
broken glass everywhere.

435
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,274
Maybe you guys should come inside.

436
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:12,078
Thomas. Thomas, all right,

437
00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:14,517
you got to understand
something, man.

438
00:33:14,609 --> 00:33:16,885
There's two things I really like...

439
00:33:16,978 --> 00:33:18,582
drinking...

440
00:33:20,381 --> 00:33:21,985
and fucking people up.

441
00:33:23,651 --> 00:33:27,155
And we're almost out of beer.

442
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,098
No, shit.

443
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:31,568
Brody, do you think you can make
a run to that 7-Eleven for a refill?

444
00:33:34,062 --> 00:33:35,564
Dude.

445
00:33:35,663 --> 00:33:37,370
- Not a problem.
- Thanks.

446
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:43,546
Guys, Thomas is right.
Maybe We should call it a night.

447
00:33:43,638 --> 00:33:47,176
Look, we'll clean up the bottles. Cool?

448
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:50,552
Go inside. Relax.

449
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:58,292
You guys are being assholes.
I'm going to bed.

450
00:33:58,386 --> 00:34:00,992
Are you coming?

451
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:05,466
Brother's chilling.

452
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,506
Just opened a fresh beer.

453
00:34:07,595 --> 00:34:10,371
Yeah. I'll be up in a little bit.

454
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:14,311
Right. I'll see you in the morning.

455
00:34:20,408 --> 00:34:21,409
Thomas?

456
00:34:22,744 --> 00:34:25,486
Can I come in?

457
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,491
Hey.

458
00:34:27,582 --> 00:34:34,625
So I just Wanted to say sorry
about downstairs.

459
00:34:34,722 --> 00:34:38,499
And I know this wasn't the way
that the Weekend was supposed to go.

460
00:34:38,593 --> 00:34:40,470
So I'm sorry.

461
00:34:40,561 --> 00:34:42,472
That's okay.

462
00:34:44,232 --> 00:34:46,644
It's just...

463
00:34:46,734 --> 00:34:49,305
your friends.

464
00:34:49,403 --> 00:34:51,246
Listen, Thomas,

465
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,410
Woodside messes with you.

466
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,284
I don't Know if it's all
high schools or what.

467
00:34:56,377 --> 00:34:59,620
But it's like everyone has an agenda.

468
00:34:59,714 --> 00:35:02,092
And it's okay if you don't have one.

469
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:05,653
But if you can't deal with the fact

470
00:35:05,753 --> 00:35:10,099
that everyone else does,
then...it...

471
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:13,604
It gets really lonely.

472
00:35:16,798 --> 00:35:18,402
Yeah.

473
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,807
Well, anyways,

474
00:35:24,906 --> 00:35:27,512
maybe We can still get
to the mountain tomorrow,

475
00:35:27,608 --> 00:35:30,179
let some people burn off
some steam on the slopes.

476
00:35:30,278 --> 00:35:32,087
Yeah. Maybe.

477
00:35:35,616 --> 00:35:37,118
Get in the Brody-mobile, bitch.
Go get the fucking beer!

478
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,356
Fuck you!

479
00:35:38,452 --> 00:35:39,430
Go get the fucking beer, already.

480
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,521
Fine!

481
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:42,032
Pussy!

482
00:36:24,866 --> 00:36:27,346
Kayley, you asleep?

483
00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:33,450
Kayley?

484
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,832
What are you doing in there?

485
00:36:56,931 --> 00:36:58,274
I got my own room.

486
00:36:58,366 --> 00:37:00,403
Why?

487
00:37:00,501 --> 00:37:04,711
Obviously there's other things
you'd rather do than hang out with me.

488
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:07,547
Oh, no. Come on.
I was just being friendly.

489
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,680
Yeah. Well, tell that to Thomas.

490
00:37:10,778 --> 00:37:12,849
You should really go talk to him.

491
00:37:12,947 --> 00:37:14,290
He'll be fine.

492
00:37:14,382 --> 00:37:16,794
Mike, he invited us up here.

493
00:37:16,884 --> 00:37:17,726
He's your friend.

494
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:20,230
I hardly know the guy.

495
00:37:22,423 --> 00:37:25,427
What is Wrong with you?

496
00:37:25,526 --> 00:37:27,563
Kayley, Wait. What are you doing?

497
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,165
I thought WE came up here
to be together.

498
00:37:30,264 --> 00:37:32,471
Yeah. That's what I thought too.

499
00:37:39,907 --> 00:37:41,511
Fuck me.

500
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,548
That adds up to nearly
25 inches in the mountains.

501
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,210
You'll want to check with the slopes
before you show up.

502
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:49,686
Some may have closed for the day.

503
00:38:49,777 --> 00:38:51,484
The Weather report--

504
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,923
I can't believe you let him go.

505
00:38:54,015 --> 00:38:56,894
Well, I'd like to see you
try and stop him.

506
00:38:56,984 --> 00:38:58,258
You try calling?

507
00:38:58,352 --> 00:39:02,129
That's a great idea.
That never occurred to me.

508
00:39:02,223 --> 00:39:05,466
Except for the fact that
his cell phone has no bars

509
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:08,597
and, apparently, Thomas' parents
can't afford phones.

510
00:39:08,696 --> 00:39:10,642
What's going on?

511
00:39:10,731 --> 00:39:13,644
Brody's missing.

512
00:39:13,734 --> 00:39:14,906
Christ, he's not missing.

513
00:39:15,002 --> 00:39:17,243
Party people here ran
out of beer last night.

514
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:18,612
And he drove out to get some.

515
00:39:18,706 --> 00:39:19,980
He's not back.

516
00:39:20,074 --> 00:39:21,712
He's probably stuck in town.

517
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:25,518
20 bucks says he's
banging some local chick.

518
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,889
Or stuck on the side
of the road somewhere, freezing.

519
00:39:27,982 --> 00:39:29,757
Where's Nicole?

520
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:32,057
What the hell do you care?

521
00:39:32,153 --> 00:39:33,757
Still downstairs.

522
00:39:33,854 --> 00:39:36,494
How far away are the neighbors?
We could use their phone.

523
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,762
It's a few miles.

524
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:39,166
You'd have to go back to the main road.

525
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,605
Well, I think We should
go look for him.

526
00:39:42,696 --> 00:39:45,643
Anyone care to join me?

527
00:39:45,733 --> 00:39:47,974
I Will.

528
00:39:49,904 --> 00:39:52,043
Mike?

529
00:39:53,741 --> 00:39:56,415
Sure. Okay.

530
00:40:08,889 --> 00:40:10,596
Brody?

531
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,411
This will take hours to dig out.

532
00:40:59,507 --> 00:41:00,815
Yeah.

533
00:41:03,611 --> 00:41:06,751
Let's at least make sure
he made it to the end of the driveway.

534
00:41:12,486 --> 00:41:15,126
Nice place the little prick's got.

535
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:17,896
Did I tell you I found a liquor cabinet?

536
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,940
Give me another hour.
Then we'll hit it.

537
00:41:22,029 --> 00:41:25,476
I'm going to go get dressed.

538
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,809
I can't believe she can still
Walk after last night.

539
00:41:30,037 --> 00:41:32,916
What about you, Derek?

540
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:35,749
You get some action last night?

541
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,557
No.

542
00:41:41,982 --> 00:41:44,929
I haven't been able to start
shit for the last two Weeks.

543
00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:48,000
I mean, wasn't great before.

544
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:51,900
But...fuck!

545
00:41:51,992 --> 00:41:53,767
Derek?

546
00:41:54,828 --> 00:41:56,637
Can We have a talk?

547
00:41:57,665 --> 00:41:59,167
Yeah.

548
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,080
Did you sleep okay last night?

549
00:42:09,176 --> 00:42:12,157
Pretty well. A little cold.

550
00:42:12,246 --> 00:42:14,157
I would have Kept you warm.

551
00:42:14,248 --> 00:42:16,125
I bet.

552
00:42:18,919 --> 00:42:20,990
I'm not a bad guy, Kayley_

553
00:42:22,256 --> 00:42:24,634
Yeah, well, not being a bad guy

554
00:42:24,725 --> 00:42:26,636
is not the same as being a good guy.

555
00:42:26,727 --> 00:42:28,297
Guys...

556
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,777
Shit!

557
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:40,550
What the hell was your problem?

558
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,178
You remember AJ's party
two Weeks ago?

559
00:42:43,277 --> 00:42:44,881
The one you couldn't make.

560
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,356
Yeah. So what?

561
00:43:20,714 --> 00:43:22,284
Oh, my God.

562
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:26,687
Brody!

563
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:44,509
Has he said anything about it?

564
00:43:44,605 --> 00:43:46,676
Like it never happened.

565
00:43:46,774 --> 00:43:49,015
Who else knows? Cops?

566
00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:52,750
No. No one else knows.

567
00:43:54,281 --> 00:43:56,022
Derek! Easy!

568
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,124
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

569
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:06,136
I Wanted to forget about it.

570
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,705
I'm going to fucking kill him.

571
00:44:07,795 --> 00:44:09,274
I know.

572
00:44:20,808 --> 00:44:23,755
Oh, no, no. Jesus...

573
00:44:23,844 --> 00:44:25,585
Oh, my God!

574
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:28,751
What the fuck happened to him?
A bear?

575
00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:31,557
Bears are hibernating right now.

576
00:44:36,824 --> 00:44:38,326
We got to call 911.

577
00:44:40,961 --> 00:44:46,240
Shit! Maybe WE can hike
up there. Get reception.

578
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:49,143
It's a longer hike than it looks.

579
00:44:49,236 --> 00:44:51,011
We need to get back and tell everyone.

580
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,607
I'll go.

581
00:44:52,706 --> 00:44:53,582
I don't think that's a good idea.

582
00:44:53,674 --> 00:44:56,712
We stick together. Come on.

583
00:44:56,810 --> 00:45:01,810
We can't just leave him here.

584
00:45:04,084 --> 00:45:07,031
Hey! Where you two been?

585
00:45:10,657 --> 00:45:13,137
D, try this. it's good shit.

586
00:45:18,198 --> 00:45:19,871
So guess what We found.

587
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,140
I can't believe WE didn't see it last night.

588
00:45:22,236 --> 00:45:23,010
What?

589
00:45:23,103 --> 00:45:24,776
A fucking hot tub.

590
00:45:24,872 --> 00:45:26,317
You guys in?

591
00:45:27,441 --> 00:45:28,886
I didn't bring my bathing suit.

592
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,512
Bingo!

593
00:45:38,786 --> 00:45:40,265
Geez, it's okay. Fine.

594
00:45:40,354 --> 00:45:42,129
You don't have to go skinny dipping.

595
00:45:49,263 --> 00:45:51,174
Okay. On 3.

596
00:45:51,265 --> 00:45:54,803
1, 2, 3.

597
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,475
Feel nice?

598
00:46:28,569 --> 00:46:29,946
Yeah.

599
00:46:31,572 --> 00:46:34,212
You want to know something
that's gonna feel even better?

600
00:46:37,444 --> 00:46:38,855
Come here.

601
00:47:15,048 --> 00:47:18,325
Actually, baby, just--
just give me one second. Okay?

602
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,455
I had a lot to drink.
I got to go empty out, okay?

603
00:47:20,554 --> 00:47:22,261
Wow. That's so hot.

604
00:47:22,356 --> 00:47:24,302
Way to kill the moment.

605
00:47:24,391 --> 00:47:25,836
Get comfortable.

606
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,303
I'll be right back.

607
00:47:34,501 --> 00:47:36,947
Don't you go nowhere.

608
00:47:39,373 --> 00:47:42,843
I'll piss our initials in the snow.

609
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,583
God...gross

610
00:48:18,612 --> 00:48:20,387
I told that guy.

611
00:48:21,715 --> 00:48:22,955
Seriously.

612
00:49:03,256 --> 00:49:06,897
V. Capital A.

613
00:49:12,065 --> 00:49:14,477
You ready for some action?

614
00:49:24,311 --> 00:49:26,450
Valerie?

615
00:49:41,294 --> 00:49:43,968
Jesus Christ, someone help!
She's dead!

616
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,008
Somebody help!

617
00:49:45,098 --> 00:49:46,099
Shit!

618
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:50,738
Somebody fucking help me!

619
00:50:00,981 --> 00:50:04,087
Holy shit! Jesus Christ!

620
00:50:04,184 --> 00:50:06,027
Jesus Christ! Holy shit!

621
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:07,063
What happened?

622
00:50:07,154 --> 00:50:08,599
I don't know. I don't know.

623
00:50:10,057 --> 00:50:12,264
I said, what the fuck happened, AJ!

624
00:50:12,359 --> 00:50:13,565
Oh, my God. Valerie...

625
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:14,570
Everybody--

626
00:50:14,661 --> 00:50:15,901
Don't touch me.

627
00:50:15,996 --> 00:50:19,239
Listen! Brody's dead too.

628
00:50:19,332 --> 00:50:21,539
The same way, but worse.

629
00:50:21,635 --> 00:50:25,412
I don't know.
Maybe there's an animal, a bear.

630
00:50:25,505 --> 00:50:27,781
I--I don't--fuck!

631
00:50:34,247 --> 00:50:36,659
Okay. Okay.

632
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,093
We got to get everyone inside.

633
00:50:38,185 --> 00:50:40,131
Get this place locked up, all right.

634
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:42,200
Oh, no. Please, don't. No.
I'm not fucking leaving.

635
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,962
Come on! Come on!

636
00:50:44,057 --> 00:50:45,400
I don't want to leave.

637
00:51:17,557 --> 00:51:20,265
Nice place you got here.

638
00:51:31,238 --> 00:51:32,774
Tell them what you told me.

639
00:51:34,741 --> 00:51:39,986
I was taking a piss, and she was alive.

640
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:45,393
Then I turned around,
and I swear I saw--

641
00:51:45,485 --> 00:51:48,261
I thought it was my imagination at first.

642
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,663
- But then I saw What--
- Bullshit!

643
00:51:49,756 --> 00:51:51,633
- Derek.
- You son of a bitch--

644
00:51:51,725 --> 00:51:52,760
I what? I what, Derek?

645
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,839
Things like that don't just happen.

646
00:51:54,928 --> 00:51:56,236
Exactly.

647
00:51:56,329 --> 00:52:01,210
You must have seen something
or heard something.

648
00:52:01,301 --> 00:52:04,145
I didn't hear anything.

649
00:52:05,772 --> 00:52:10,152
But I think I saw--
I think I saw someone.

650
00:52:10,243 --> 00:52:12,223
A person?

651
00:52:12,312 --> 00:52:15,691
Oh, my God. What if it's
that guy they’re after?

652
00:52:15,782 --> 00:52:17,284
The guy on the flyer.

653
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,795
What did he look like?

654
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,489
I don't know.

655
00:52:20,587 --> 00:52:23,431
He was...

656
00:52:31,765 --> 00:52:33,301
Oh, shit! We got to get
the fuck out of here!

657
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,107
Get the fuck away!

658
00:52:35,202 --> 00:52:36,738
Everyone, stay calm.

659
00:52:36,837 --> 00:52:39,408
It's him.

660
00:52:39,506 --> 00:52:41,417
It's him. I know it.

661
00:52:41,508 --> 00:52:42,714
What? Who?

662
00:52:42,809 --> 00:52:44,811
Donner.

663
00:52:46,313 --> 00:52:47,553
Jesus Christ.

664
00:52:47,647 --> 00:52:48,625
This is what happens.

665
00:52:48,715 --> 00:52:51,093
Locals, they talk about it.

666
00:52:51,184 --> 00:52:55,155
The half-eaten bodies
like an animal attack, but Worse.

667
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:57,565
Thomas, that's a campfire story.

668
00:52:57,657 --> 00:53:00,137
No. it's not.

669
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:04,731
Then who is it'? The guy Epstein?

670
00:53:04,831 --> 00:53:07,175
You think he could do that to Valerie?

671
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:09,076
You think he could take down Brody?

672
00:53:09,169 --> 00:53:12,116
It doesn't matter who it is.
We can handle this.

673
00:53:12,205 --> 00:53:13,309
We just need to dig the car out.

674
00:53:13,406 --> 00:53:14,476
Right. Good.

675
00:53:14,574 --> 00:53:16,178
We're all in this together.

676
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,381
Right, Derek?

677
00:53:20,313 --> 00:53:21,815
We have a few more hours until dark.

678
00:53:21,915 --> 00:53:23,758
Do you have snow shovels?

679
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:25,261
In the garage.

680
00:53:25,352 --> 00:53:27,923
We need Weapons. Do you have a gun?

681
00:53:30,223 --> 00:53:32,203
Knives, axes, baseball bats.

682
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:35,466
Anything that would hurt,
that would slow him down.

683
00:53:36,897 --> 00:53:39,707
Great. We're dead.

684
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:42,279
How's this?

685
00:53:42,369 --> 00:53:45,748
That's good.

686
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:47,614
Now, we're talking.

687
00:53:47,707 --> 00:53:50,278
I want to be the one to kill him.

688
00:54:10,797 --> 00:54:12,435
Oh, Shit.

689
00:54:28,315 --> 00:54:31,353
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

690
00:54:31,451 --> 00:54:34,193
What?

691
00:54:35,722 --> 00:54:37,724
The tires are slashed.

692
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:53,474
Okay. I've triple checked the doors.
The;they’re all locked.

693
00:54:53,573 --> 00:54:56,110
- We should sweep the house.
- Lock the Windows.

694
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:57,620
Pull the blinds down.

695
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,487
We'll take the bedrooms.
You stay upstairs.

696
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:02,355
Where are the phones, Thomas?

697
00:55:02,449 --> 00:55:03,792
Why don't your parents have phones?

698
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:05,590
My dad--he says he comes here
to get away.

699
00:55:05,685 --> 00:55:07,358
He doesn't want to be reached.

700
00:55:07,454 --> 00:55:09,525
They don't have one handset
somewhere for emergencies?

701
00:55:09,622 --> 00:55:11,465
I can look.

702
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,003
Okay. AJ, you and I will take the back.

703
00:55:13,093 --> 00:55:14,731
Derek, you stay here.

704
00:55:14,828 --> 00:55:16,671
What'?! NO!

705
00:55:16,763 --> 00:55:18,037
We need someone to Watch our backs.

706
00:55:19,332 --> 00:55:20,640
He's bait.

707
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:29,314
Okay, baby?

708
00:55:30,677 --> 00:55:31,883
Fine.

709
00:55:34,981 --> 00:55:36,460
After you.

710
00:55:47,494 --> 00:55:49,940
Who's this, Thomas?

711
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:51,373
Your mom?

712
00:55:51,464 --> 00:55:52,772
That's a family friend.

713
00:55:52,866 --> 00:55:55,312
All right, next Window.

714
00:56:03,009 --> 00:56:05,455
There's something I want from you.

715
00:56:05,545 --> 00:56:07,957
What?

716
00:56:09,015 --> 00:56:12,519
I want you to ask for my forgiveness.

717
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,758
For what?

718
00:56:14,854 --> 00:56:18,267
For what you did to me.

719
00:56:18,358 --> 00:56:21,271
At your party.

720
00:56:21,361 --> 00:56:23,739
I'll be right back.

721
00:56:25,331 --> 00:56:27,072
I don't know what you're talking about.

722
00:56:27,167 --> 00:56:29,704
I think you do.

723
00:56:31,504 --> 00:56:34,542
Look. I don't remember
anything from that night, okay?

724
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:35,881
- SO..
- You do.

725
00:56:57,864 --> 00:57:01,607
I was super drunk, and so were you.

726
00:57:01,701 --> 00:57:03,612
You know.

727
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:51,423
I don't remember it.

728
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:57,232
Look. Put that down. Just talk to me.

729
00:57:57,323 --> 00:57:59,360
It's just the two of us.

730
00:57:59,459 --> 00:58:02,906
We've been friends
for a really long time.

731
00:58:11,938 --> 00:58:15,181
If you ask, I'll forgive you.

732
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,848
But if you don't...

733
00:58:21,781 --> 00:58:23,658
Look.

734
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,559
Whatever happened--

735
00:58:25,652 --> 00:58:27,757
Tell me why.

736
00:58:28,788 --> 00:58:31,826
Tell me why you did it.

737
00:58:35,061 --> 00:58:37,473
I just...

738
00:58:39,799 --> 00:58:44,339
couldn't help myself. Okay?

739
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:47,748
Look. I'm sorry.

740
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:50,582
Okay.

741
00:58:50,677 --> 00:58:52,918
Okay.

742
00:58:55,548 --> 00:58:57,994
Don't move.

743
00:58:58,084 --> 00:59:00,086
Why?

744
00:59:00,186 --> 00:59:02,894
I don't want to get blood on me.

745
00:59:24,043 --> 00:59:26,216
This is far enough.

746
00:59:30,883 --> 00:59:33,454
Whoever's out there
is going to come after AJ.

747
00:59:33,553 --> 00:59:36,500
And the rest of us can go.

748
00:59:36,589 --> 00:59:39,729
The;they’re going
to ask what happened.

749
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:42,102
So?

750
00:59:45,365 --> 00:59:47,971
Sorry, buddy.

751
00:59:48,067 --> 00:59:50,013
You brought this on yourself.

752
00:59:58,945 --> 01:00:00,947
Poor baby.

753
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:13,163
No, please. Please!

754
01:00:14,961 --> 01:00:17,100
No, Wait! No!

755
01:00:19,098 --> 01:00:22,238
He's taking him.

756
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,089
You ready?

757
01:00:35,748 --> 01:00:38,695
AJ, no!

758
01:00:41,854 --> 01:00:45,301
Oh, my God!
AJ, what are you doing?

759
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:47,701
Come back!

760
01:00:56,969 --> 01:00:58,846
What's happening?

761
01:00:58,938 --> 01:01:00,281
AJ, he Went out there.
He saw the guy,

762
01:01:00,373 --> 01:01:01,716
and he took off after him.

763
01:01:01,808 --> 01:01:03,378
- And you let him go!
- Are you crazy?

764
01:01:03,476 --> 01:01:04,716
Derek tried to stop him.

765
01:01:04,811 --> 01:01:07,189
He said he was going
to kill the guy.

766
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,454
He said help him
or get out of the way.

767
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:12,791
So you got out of the way?

768
01:01:12,885 --> 01:01:14,990
Fuck you, Mike.
You would have done differently?

769
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:18,331
Yeah. I would've.

770
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:21,166
I'm not like you. I'm not an asshole.

771
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,206
What was that? I didn't catch that.

772
01:01:23,296 --> 01:01:24,741
Get in my face and say that.

773
01:01:24,831 --> 01:01:26,674
Guys.

774
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:28,939
We need to go after him.

775
01:01:29,035 --> 01:01:30,241
Fuck that.

776
01:01:30,336 --> 01:01:32,316
No. We need to get out
While we still can.

777
01:01:32,405 --> 01:01:34,851
In the dark? And leave AJ?

778
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:37,012
AJ could be dead or close to it.

779
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,589
If the killer has him,
that gives us time.

780
01:01:38,678 --> 01:01:40,624
No! We get him back.

781
01:01:40,713 --> 01:01:42,750
No!

782
01:01:42,849 --> 01:01:44,192
Fuck AJ.

783
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:46,126
He made his choice.

784
01:01:46,219 --> 01:01:48,927
Not our problem.

785
01:01:49,021 --> 01:01:51,023
- I'm with you.
- Me too.

786
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:08,412
AJ, are you out here?!

787
01:02:11,744 --> 01:02:13,280
Wait

788
01:02:16,215 --> 01:02:18,889
He was bleeding
when he left the house.

789
01:02:23,089 --> 01:02:26,002
There's two sets of footprints.

790
01:02:26,092 --> 01:02:30,837
It's like somethings been dragged.

791
01:02:30,930 --> 01:02:34,742
Look. Changes direction here.

792
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:36,677
That--

793
01:02:36,769 --> 01:02:38,976
That must be Where--

794
01:02:39,071 --> 01:02:42,211
There's an old shed about
100 yards through those Woods.

795
01:02:46,145 --> 01:02:49,786
Thomas, you okay?

796
01:02:49,882 --> 01:02:51,919
I don't trust them.

797
01:02:55,655 --> 01:02:57,225
We need to get AJ.

798
01:02:58,891 --> 01:03:02,338
You go back.
Keep an eye on Derek and Nicole.

799
01:03:02,428 --> 01:03:03,668
Can you handle them?

800
01:03:03,763 --> 01:03:04,935
Yeah.

801
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:08,035
Good. Lock the door.

802
01:03:17,343 --> 01:03:20,449
Hey, Derek, Nicole.

803
01:03:39,265 --> 01:03:43,077
What do We do if he's there?

804
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:48,748
Hey, We do what We have to, okay '?

805
01:04:26,812 --> 01:04:29,315
I didn't want to say anything
with everyone else here.

806
01:04:29,415 --> 01:04:33,864
But my parents keep
a snowmobile out back.

807
01:05:07,086 --> 01:05:08,622
Ready?

808
01:05:39,151 --> 01:05:41,893
Is he dead?

809
01:06:04,076 --> 01:06:06,522
Yeah, he's dead.

810
01:06:11,951 --> 01:06:13,123
Watch out!

811
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:16,624
Mike!

812
01:06:31,103 --> 01:06:33,049
You're okay. You're okay.

813
01:06:35,441 --> 01:06:36,681
You did it.

814
01:06:39,478 --> 01:06:42,357
Shit! What do We do now'?

815
01:06:42,448 --> 01:06:46,089
I'll take care of it.

816
01:06:46,185 --> 01:06:49,394
Go back and tell the others it's over.

817
01:07:53,853 --> 01:07:56,561
"Made in China."

818
01:08:14,774 --> 01:08:16,447
Epstein.

819
01:08:29,455 --> 01:08:32,436
Thomas, Derek, Nicole, let me in!

820
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:36,063
We got him. We got Donner.

821
01:08:54,446 --> 01:08:56,323
Hello?

822
01:09:03,422 --> 01:09:06,096
Hey, why is the door unlocked?

823
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:15,442
1683 Toland

824
01:09:22,675 --> 01:09:23,983
Shit!

825
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:31,489
Kayleyl Kayleyl Derek!

826
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,586
Anybody!

827
01:10:56,802 --> 01:10:58,679
Nicole?

828
01:11:29,935 --> 01:11:32,415
Thomas?

829
01:11:33,772 --> 01:11:37,845
Thomas, what's going on?

830
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:41,547
What are you doing?

831
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:47,430
What are you doing?

832
01:11:56,862 --> 01:11:59,342
What are you doing?

833
01:12:17,316 --> 01:12:20,490
The flesh has to be living
for it to do me any good.

834
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:22,793
So I have to keep you alive.

835
01:12:22,888 --> 01:12:25,960
I'm sorry.

836
01:12:26,058 --> 01:12:30,939
This way, more blood stays
in your heart and brain.

837
01:12:36,902 --> 01:12:38,882
Jesus...

838
01:12:38,971 --> 01:12:40,951
Thomas, no.

839
01:12:45,144 --> 01:12:47,818
Thomas, let me go.

840
01:12:47,913 --> 01:12:49,950
I'm your friend.

841
01:12:51,917 --> 01:12:54,056
Talk to me.

842
01:12:54,153 --> 01:12:57,566
We'll get help for you.
I'll get help for you.

843
01:12:57,656 --> 01:13:00,034
Nobody can help me.

844
01:13:05,831 --> 01:13:09,540
Mike! Help!

845
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:11,546
Help me! No!

846
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:14,550
I think he has his hands full.

847
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:17,783
Nicole!

848
01:14:47,366 --> 01:14:49,539
Mike, help me!

849
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:02,591
No!

850
01:15:06,151 --> 01:15:10,566
Mike. Mike, it was him.
Thomas did all of this

851
01:15:11,657 --> 01:15:14,729
Mike, help me.

852
01:15:17,563 --> 01:15:22,774
Cut her down.

853
01:15:22,868 --> 01:15:25,109
Mighty Mike.

854
01:15:25,204 --> 01:15:27,514
I don't understand.

855
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:29,882
Kayley was right.

856
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:36,523
Donner died a long, long time ago.

857
01:15:44,256 --> 01:15:48,227
But legends are funny things.

858
01:15:48,327 --> 01:15:51,865
Just lying there,

859
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:54,501
Waiting for something,

860
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:57,012
someone to make them believe.

861
01:15:57,102 --> 01:16:00,948
I created a new Donner.

862
01:16:01,039 --> 01:16:03,212
I always do.

863
01:16:07,879 --> 01:16:08,789
Can I help you?

864
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,120
I'm sorry to bother you, sir.

865
01:16:10,215 --> 01:16:11,455
I'm just out cross country skiing,

866
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:12,620
and I've run out of Water.

867
01:16:12,718 --> 01:16:13,890
Do you mind if I fill up my canteen?

868
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:15,260
No. Sure. Come on in.

869
01:16:15,354 --> 01:16:17,163
I gave Epstein the hunger.

870
01:16:17,256 --> 01:16:21,602
His girlfriend--
fought it as long as he could.

871
01:16:21,693 --> 01:16:24,674
But the hunger... it always wins.

872
01:16:27,633 --> 01:16:29,010
So...

873
01:16:29,101 --> 01:16:30,136
Brody?

874
01:16:30,235 --> 01:16:31,714
First one's always mine.

875
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:36,720
Then I let Epstein out of the shed.

876
01:16:36,808 --> 01:16:38,754
Just like a magic trick,

877
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:42,121
the key part is distracting the audience.

878
01:16:42,214 --> 01:16:46,629
We kill Epstein and then
I finish the rest of you.

879
01:16:46,718 --> 01:16:49,130
That was supposed to be it.

880
01:16:49,221 --> 01:16:52,498
But what Derek and Nicole
did to AJ--

881
01:16:52,591 --> 01:16:55,629
there needs to be some justice.

882
01:16:57,629 --> 01:16:59,700
Nicole, she didn't fight it.

883
01:16:59,798 --> 01:17:02,711
Didn't even try.

884
01:17:05,137 --> 01:17:07,743
When you first get the hunger,

885
01:17:07,839 --> 01:17:11,150
you're like a wild animal.

886
01:17:11,243 --> 01:17:15,658
And all of the civilization
gets stripped away.

887
01:17:15,747 --> 01:17:17,988
So it was all you.

888
01:17:19,818 --> 01:17:21,320
Me?

889
01:17:22,654 --> 01:17:24,327
It was your idea.

890
01:17:24,423 --> 01:17:26,767
I barely mentioned the cabin,

891
01:17:26,858 --> 01:17:31,000
and you were talking about
your friend with a car.

892
01:17:32,698 --> 01:17:35,235
I just followed your advice, Mike.

893
01:17:37,402 --> 01:17:40,849
Put you on the payroll.

894
01:17:43,308 --> 01:17:48,587
So I guess I owe you. Leave now.

895
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:50,717
Head south over the mountain.

896
01:17:50,816 --> 01:17:54,025
Eventually you'll hit Highway 80.

897
01:17:54,119 --> 01:17:57,362
What you do then won’t matter.

898
01:17:57,456 --> 01:18:03,873
Or you can stay and die.

899
01:18:03,962 --> 01:18:08,069
Mike, please help me.

900
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:28,259
Mike! NO!

901
01:18:44,302 --> 01:18:46,407
Let's start.

902
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:55,955
The first few Winters were hard.

903
01:18:59,284 --> 01:19:03,255
I lived like an animal.

904
01:19:03,355 --> 01:19:08,100
With each passing year,
this place grew less wild.

905
01:19:08,193 --> 01:19:11,140
And so did I.

906
01:19:11,229 --> 01:19:14,039
Found an orphanage.

907
01:19:14,132 --> 01:19:16,339
And then foster parents.

908
01:19:16,435 --> 01:19:18,881
I Went to school.

909
01:19:18,970 --> 01:19:23,976
And as long as I came back to feed,
I hardly aged.

910
01:19:26,411 --> 01:19:28,652
Practically couldn't be hurt.

911
01:19:28,747 --> 01:19:30,658
It's easy--

912
01:19:30,749 --> 01:19:34,925
new school, let's go camping.

913
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:40,299
Let's get a houseboat Let's go skiing.

914
01:19:43,929 --> 01:19:46,876
There's plenty of great getaways
in Donner country.

915
01:19:46,965 --> 01:19:51,141
Don't Worry about Mike.

916
01:19:51,236 --> 01:19:52,476
He won’t make it.

917
01:19:52,571 --> 01:19:55,347
I always save one to hunt.

918
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:58,444
You don’t have to do this, Thomas.

919
01:19:58,543 --> 01:20:02,423
I know there's a good part of you.

920
01:20:02,514 --> 01:20:04,858
Don't you get it, Kayley?

921
01:20:04,950 --> 01:20:07,863
We all become the thing We hate.

01:20:10,021 --> 01:20:11,159
No.

923
01:20:17,095 --> 01:20:18,802
You can choose.

924
01:20:20,265 --> 01:20:23,872
You can't choose not to be hungry.

925
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:37,389
This will sting.

926
01:20:37,482 --> 01:20:40,224
So will this.

927
01:20:43,421 --> 01:20:45,662
Go!

928
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:04,521
Mike! Mike, Watch out!

929
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:54,126
Please, don't do...

930
01:21:55,527 --> 01:21:57,302
Fuck you!

931

Okay.

The;they’re going to take you into town
now for an examination, okay'?

One thing, though,

938
01:23:15,106 --> 01:23:17,586

in the cellar?

939
01:23:17,676 --> 01:23:19,713
Yeah.

940
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:22,019
