1
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:46,880
Maya,

2
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:48,282
hey Girl...

3
00:00:48,316 --> 00:00:49,283
alright.

4
00:00:49,317 --> 00:00:50,284
I'm going away
for a couple days.

5
00:00:50,318 --> 00:00:51,885
You behave.

6
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:53,354
No peeing on the floor.

7
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,556
Behave, alright.

8
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:01,995
I'm coming.

9
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:05,866
So you're gonna be
filming like the whole time?

10
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,536
Definitely, I just
go this, yesterday.

11
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,003
Yeah, how much was it?

12
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:10,704
Get what?

13
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:11,739
The City.

14
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,074
Oh, the view,
it's really nice.

15
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:16,210
Leo, what are you doing?

16
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:17,978
Get back in the car!

17
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:18,679
I'm fine.

18
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:22,015
Leo, you're
gonna fall out.

19
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,584
I would slow down,
but there are cars behind

20
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:24,885
us, and I can't
slow down that much.

21
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,220
I'll be fine, I
wanna get this.

22
00:01:29,223 --> 00:01:30,491
That's the first
thing we're buying

23
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:33,394
at the store... coffee.

24
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:38,566
Hey, birthday girl.

25
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,934
Hey, how ya doing?

26
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,069
Good, how are you?

27
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,773
Good, I am just going
through Grand Central,

28
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,975
and we are on our
way to get you

29
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:51,044
so where are you
gonna be at?

30
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,215
- No.
- Are you feeling better?

31
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:55,183
Um, yeah, yeah.

32
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:58,085
I think the
straight road is helping.

33
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:58,952
Do you need anything or...

34
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:00,421
We have water up here.

35
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,323
Um, I'm ok.

36
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:05,326
We have water or
coffee cake or something.

37
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,494
No, um, I'm good.

38
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:08,596
Coffee cake for
car sickness?

39
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,530
I don't...

40
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:11,199
It's getting
pretty snowy out guys.

41
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:13,100
Yeah, it is.

42
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,735
My days on the farm.

43
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:18,306
I used to walk 20 miles
barefoot in the snow.

44
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:20,107
Listen, she has
the window down,

45
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,209
just take deep breaths.

46
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:23,043
As soon as we can pull
over, let's just pull over.

47
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,745
Alright, as soon as I
can pull over, sweetie,

48
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,079
I promise I'm going
to pull over.

49
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:27,715
This road is fucking crazy.

50
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,149
Oh, my God yeah.

51
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:30,418
Look at
that over there.

52
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:31,719
It's like... Look
at those icicles.

53
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:32,420
Oh my god
that's awesome.

54
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:33,387
Well can we...

55
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:35,223
we can look at
the beautiful scenery later,

56
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:36,156
if we could just...

57
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,358
Well I'm going as
fast as I can Mark, ok?

58
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:38,792
No, we don't have to go
fast, but let's just.

59
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,794
But you know I
mean, I'm trying.

60
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:41,362
Yeah, just do it.

61
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:42,095
She's sick.

62
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:42,996
I think it's ok,
I think it's ok.

63
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,332
Please do, it's ok,
she'll be alright.

64
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:44,965
Just put the hazards on.

65
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:45,766
Just go all the way over.

66
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:48,536
Alright, I'll go
all the way over.

67
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:50,003
Ooh...

68
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:51,104
Jeez, Oooh.

69
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:51,939
Ok, we're ok.

70
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:54,608
This is good.

71
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:55,476
She's getting out.

72
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,411
Alright, I'm putting
the hazards on.

73
00:02:58,446 --> 00:03:01,682
Is she, is she ok?

74
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,183
- Leo!
- What?

75
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:05,018
You really. It's not cool
to film her right now.

76
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:05,886
Not right now.

77
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,088
She's really
not feeling well.

78
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,122
Tanya, do you
want some water?

79
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:12,560
We've got lots of
bottles of water right here.

80
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:16,163
I think we should go get her
to like a bathroom maybe.

81
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,765
Like some
medicine or something?

82
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:19,533
You guys, I'll be,
I'm fine, it's just...

83
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:20,734
Well, no you're not fine.

84
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:22,236
No, it's, the air's good.

85
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,904
The air's really good.

86
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,274
I think that there's probably
a gas station or something.

87
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:28,008
We can probably go
to a gas station.

88
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,109
I'm gonna
get back on the road.

89
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:29,977
Yeah, but where?

90
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,945
Where are we?

91
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:33,447
She doesn't look good.

92
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:34,782
Well alright,
there has

93
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:35,949
to be a gas station
or restaurant.

94
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:37,050
I think I saw a
couple miles ago,

95
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:39,820
that there's a
town coming up.

96
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:40,988
Good.

97
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,122
Sweetie we're getting you
there as soon as we can ok?

98
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:42,956
No, it's fine.

99
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:43,524
I'm fine.

100
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:46,059
No, we're almost there.

101
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:48,829
If you're not feeling
well, then you know...

102
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:51,299
Don't worry... the
house will be there...

103
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:52,132
Who's this asshole?

104
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,067
No matter what time
we get there.

105
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:54,635
I don't know.

106
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:58,005
Just someone passing us.

107
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,874
Wow, nice move buddy.

108
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,976
It's not dangerous outside
right now or anything.

109
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,513
It's fine, okay.

110
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,180
Oh, he's slowing down now.

111
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:08,982
Smart move bud.

112
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:10,618
Why'd you pass us buddy?

113
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:11,952
You got really far.

114
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:12,520
I know.

115
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:15,188
Yeah, what is he doing?

116
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,692
WHAT is he DOING?

117
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:19,293
I don't know.

118
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,760
Can you guys.

119
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:20,561
Is it clear?

120
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,929
Can you see
around him?

121
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,063
Yeah, if you go now,
you're gonna have

122
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,732
to go kind
of quickly.

123
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:25,299
Ohhh.

124
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,368
Oh my God!

125
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:28,035
Alright, it's ok.

126
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:28,969
Oh, be careful honey.

127
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,871
I will, I will.

128
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:31,372
Yeah, thanks.

129
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:31,972
You jerk!

130
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,475
Leo, don't film him.

131
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:35,343
What's he doing?

132
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:38,646
Leo, that's not
helping, I don't know.

133
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:39,580
The roads are horrible.

134
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,948
How dare he.

135
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:43,050
Someone's got a teeny dick.

136
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,452
What?

137
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,086
That's why men do that.

138
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:46,787
Why men do what?

139
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,655
It's the teeny
dick thing.

140
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:48,489
They have to make
up for it somehow

141
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:51,359
so they be dicks
on the road.

142
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:54,762
Well, we are classy ladies and
we got through it classily.

143
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,063
God!

144
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,331
Alright, that
was kinda weird.

145
00:04:57,365 --> 00:04:58,231
That was weird.

146
00:04:58,265 --> 00:04:59,700
Some people
have issues right.

147
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,569
Whatever.

148
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:02,470
We're fine.

149
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:04,137
But, like really,
road rage right now?

150
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,205
Look at it outside.

151
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:08,909
It's really awful, and I
don't know why people feel

152
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:09,910
the need to do that.

153
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,612
Yeah, that was
pretty bad, we skidded.

154
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,581
I know, but
let's just

155
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:14,882
be thankful nothing
worse happened.

156
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,917
Where is this
town, there's nothing.

157
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,018
There's is something.

158
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:21,221
I, there, I remember there
was something up ahead,

159
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:25,258
I think we're
gonna be fine.

160
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,861
I hope not...

161
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,233
It's alright.

162
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,502
Here comes this
guy again.

163
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:35,002
What?

164
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:35,569
He's coming back?

165
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:36,904
Is that the same guy?

166
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:37,805
Here's this guy again.

167
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,807
Oh, no.

168
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,908
Ree-dic-u-lous!

169
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,410
Miriam, just drive
really slowly please.

170
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:44,545
I'm trying, but he's
getting really close guys.

171
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:48,816
He's
beeping at us.

172
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:49,517
What the hell
is your problem?

173
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,084
What do you want me to do?

174
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:53,654
What are you
trying to prove buddy?

175
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,255
Guys, should I pull
over, what should I do?

176
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,790
Just keep going,
just keep going!

177
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:58,225
Just, yeah, just
pull over because...

178
00:05:58,258 --> 00:05:59,827
No, we can't pull over,
there's no where to pull over.

179
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,429
No Mark, there's,
there's no where to go.

180
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:03,431
Just don't pull over,
we'll just keep going.

181
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:04,965
Oh my God!

182
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:05,866
Leo, I don't think he
likes you filming him.

183
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,367
You guys, I'm
feeling really sick.

184
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:08,168
Oh my God!

185
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,302
You guys, she
doesn't feel good.

186
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:10,237
Well, what are we supposed
to, well we can't stop...

187
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,338
I'm doing my best...

188
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,973
No way, he's passing us,
hey he's passing us again...

189
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:15,308
Just pass us already.

190
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:16,176
Fine, go already.

191
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:16,744
Who is this guy?

192
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,245
NO way!

193
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:20,948
Just go!

194
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:21,615
You kidding me.

195
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:25,185
Wow.

196
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,420
Jerk off.

197
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:28,021
We have to find
somewhere really soon.

198
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,089
She doesn't feel good.

199
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:29,623
This is not ok.

200
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:30,458
There's nothing.

201
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:31,459
Look ahead,
there's nothing ahead.

202
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:32,993
I'm trying, then just
keep going and as soon

203
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,127
as you see something
just pull over.

204
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:35,062
I'm going.

205
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:36,497
You guys, just get there.

206
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,631
I'm trying.

207
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:39,032
Just get as far away from
this asshole as possible.

208
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:39,733
He's gone.

209
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:40,568
Where did, he's guh...

210
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:41,535
He just sped up and went...

211
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,937
Trying to mess up
someone else's day.

212
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:44,938
Leo, maybe we should put
the camera away right now.

213
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:46,440
Yeah, enough with the
camera Leo, seriously.

214
00:06:46,474 --> 00:06:48,041
I think, a break would be...

215
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:48,942
No, it'll be good.

216
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:50,444
You guys'll like it
and then, It'll...

217
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:51,411
I don't think we're gonna
like a car chase..

218
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:54,214
You keep saying that
Leo, but it's not funny.

219
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,683
Let's just turn the
camera off, please?

220
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:58,586
Leo, please turn it off.

221
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:01,522
Alright, I'll just
keep it pointed forward.

222
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:03,624
Are you feeling
better in the front?

223
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:08,529
Uh, yeah Leo... I'm great.

224
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:09,930
Yeah, I really
feel like we must

225
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,832
be coming up to
something soon.

226
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:15,603
There's gotta be a
gas station somewhere.

227
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,273
Oh wait, here she comes.

228
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,510
Hey Tanya.

229
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,812
Hey, you want some chips?

230
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:27,047
I'm alright, thank you.

231
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,615
You want some chips?

232
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:29,517
Are you feeling better?

233
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,921
Yeah, thanks...
how are you?

234
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,188
Kinda cold.

235
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:35,956
Kinda.

236
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:37,257
Alright, so...

237
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,527
You guys, how bout
some real food, anybody?

238
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:39,927
Yeah!

239
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,794
Yeah!

240
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:42,062
Like a diner or something?

241
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,197
Pringles are great but...

242
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:45,465
Yeah, grilled
cheese sandwich!

243
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:46,767
Grilled Cheese!

244
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,268
You and that camera,
all vacation, really.

245
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,670
It's gonna be worth it.

246
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:50,904
Do you want some chips?

247
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:52,105
Nah, I'm good.

248
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,241
I got, who do I got?

249
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:57,244
I got the crackers.

250
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,747
Crackers.

251
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,116
Guys?

252
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,218
What?

253
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:05,986
Who is that?

254
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:06,520
That's the van.

255
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:08,055
Is that?

256
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:08,488
No it's not?

257
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:11,592
No way!

258
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,360
Let's just get in the car
and get something to eat ok?

259
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:14,361
Are you
kidding me?

260
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:15,663
We should go guys...

261
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:18,065
Let's just go,
let's... c'mon.

262
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,771
Lock the car.

263
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:29,677
Alright, this is weird.

264
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,477
This is really messed up.

265
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,378
Is that the same guy?

266
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,947
Maybe it's just like
a hick, like a guy

267
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,282
who lives around
here maybe?

268
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,951
Like, married his sister or
something and skins animals.

269
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,753
Yeah, but then what about
doing it before with driving

270
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:41,622
in front and then
stopping and...

271
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:42,389
Alright I think
we're ready to go.

272
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:43,290
Maybe it's not
the same guy.

273
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:44,357
Alright let's just go.

274
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,859
OK, go.

275
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:48,095
Alright, I'm
trying to go right now.

276
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,030
AAAAHHHH!!!

277
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:50,764
Oh my God!!!

278
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:52,499
Jesus!

279
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,868
You guys forgot
this in the bathroom.

280
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:55,569
Thank you.

281
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:56,604
Oh my God!

282
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:57,671
Yeah, no problem.

283
00:08:57,705 --> 00:08:58,739
Alright, be safe.

284
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,240
Sorry, thank you.

285
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,541
Alright, OK, so
let's go, let's go.

286
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:02,142
This is your phone Cassy?

287
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:02,810
Sorry.

288
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:05,378
Just, yeah, please.

289
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:07,715
Is anyone coming
from that side guys?

290
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:08,682
You're ok.

291
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:09,817
I just want to get the
hell out of here ok?

292
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,251
If he goes the other way,
if he goes the other way,

293
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,485
we're fine, careful.

294
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,287
He's not going
the other way.

295
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:15,589
No, he was just coming
from the same direction.

296
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:16,256
Is he following us?

297
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,991
That we were before and...

298
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:19,927
He's gonna uh... just
make a right up ahead.

299
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,294
Yeah he's
friggin following us.

300
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,496
Oh my God.

301
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,464
Alright, I think
there's a turn up here...

302
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,332
Does anybody have any
cell phone service,

303
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:29,970
can you guys check?

304
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:30,470
Nothing.

305
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,905
No.

306
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:32,640
Everyone's out?

307
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:34,507
Are you kidding
me right now?

308
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,177
No, just calm down ok, cuz
you're stressing me out.

309
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,245
He's right behind us.

310
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:39,847
I know he's right
behind us Leo,

311
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,914
that's why you should
not stress out.

312
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:42,816
He's kind of close too.

313
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,818
You guys just relax, it's ok,
he's not gonna do anything.

314
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:45,853
His headlights scare
the crap out of me.

315
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:46,787
If he was gonna do
anything, he would have

316
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,755
done
something by now.

317
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:48,822
Alright...

318
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:52,693
- This guy is just a spook.
- I'm taking this right.

319
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:53,861
He's taking a right.

320
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:55,595
He can see my blinker, of
course he's taking a right,

321
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:58,198
cuz he sees that
I'm taking a right.

322
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:01,702
Alright, guys,
chill out, chill out.

323
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,971
It's ok, just breathe,
just make a right up here.

324
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,740
Yeah, I'm breathing, ok.

325
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:11,611
Is he turning?

326
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:18,551
- He's passing...
- He passed us.

327
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:19,820
See, you guys, come on...

328
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:20,520
Did you see that?

329
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,122
It wasn't the same guy.

330
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,290
How do you know it
wasn't the same guy?

331
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:26,293
It was just someone in a van
who has a van very similar

332
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:27,294
to the one we
saw previously.

333
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,062
And he wanted to turn
right, but just didn't?

334
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:30,330
Alright, alright, so
let's just get to the diner.

335
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,666
Yeah.

336
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,234
He's gone.

337
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,075
Alright, so how far is
it to er... the house?

338
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:45,212
It's like
another 15 minutes.

339
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,080
I just want to get there
and I want to lock the door

340
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:51,551
and I want to
get in bed.

341
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,420
Sounds good.

342
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:54,688
Can we hit up a
diner first still?

343
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:55,989
Yeah.

344
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:57,024
I'm hungry.

345
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:58,058
How bout a drink?

346
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,360
Yeah, a drink would be
really great actually.

347
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,261
I'll take a double.

348
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:02,495
I think I will share that
with you...

349
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:03,330
Oh will you?

350
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:04,464
Monsieur Mark.

351
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,000
And I believe that
someone here is turning 21.

352
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:07,367
Hmmm.

353
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,836
Yeah.

354
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,270
Uh oh.

355
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:11,204
First drink's on me.

356
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:12,539
Oh man.

357
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:13,506
Thank you.

358
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,109
My heart is like pounding.

359
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:16,643
Is your heart pounding?

360
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,377
My heart's pounding.

361
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,612
Are you feeling better?

362
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:20,580
That just
knocked it out of me.

363
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,315
Yeah right.

364
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,852
God!

365
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:27,354
We're almost there.

366
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:29,522
Wait, so what's in a Panini?

367
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:32,292
Melted Cheese...

368
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:32,726
Hi.

369
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,261
Hi.

370
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,163
Sorry about my friend
with the camera,

371
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,230
shoving it in
everyone's face.

372
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:38,899
C'mon.

373
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:39,532
Everyone ready?

374
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,501
Who's going first?

375
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,035
I'll go.

376
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,669
I pick you.

377
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,037
Uh, ok.

378
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:45,105
Can I get a
veggie burger...

379
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,073
Sure.

380
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:48,141
Deluxe?

381
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,547
What?

382
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,384
It's a
perfectly delicious meal,

383
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,519
and I don't understand
why you ridicule it.

384
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,721
Broiled Cod?

385
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:05,058
The cod ladies
and gentlemen.

386
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:08,528
Can we not give a Mr.
Close up to my fish?

387
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,164
At a diner, broiled cod?

388
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:12,866
You want to try some?

389
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,867
That doesn't
sound good...

390
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:14,935
She doesn't feel good,
why would you say that?

391
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:18,405
Banana split for
the birthday girl?

392
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:20,307
With nuts.

393
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,143
And the sauce.

394
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,612
And cherries.

395
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:27,881
Just trying to help.

396
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,483
Just trying to
be a good boy.

397
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,285
And provide for my friends,
being the hunter gatherer

398
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:34,955
that I am.

399
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,223
We're the berry pickers.

400
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,858
Are you gonna shoot
a deer this weekend?

401
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:39,026
Yeah I am.

402
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:39,726
OK, no no.

403
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,828
Some nice Venison.

404
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:42,162
I'm sorry we got
some vegetarians.

405
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,664
Yeah, we can cook
it in the fireplace.

406
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,633
We're gonna shoot
him right in the face.

407
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,635
That would be a great idea.

408
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:50,170
Guys, guys.

409
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:51,939
Look out the window.

410
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:53,373
That's not funny Miriam.

411
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:54,842
I'm not trying to be funny.

412
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:55,475
Look at the van.

413
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,377
It's the same van.

414
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:57,911
It's the same color.

415
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:00,180
It's the same size.

416
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:03,750
He's watching us.

417
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,619
He's driving off.

418
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:07,888
But this isn't
coincidence anymore.

419
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,891
What is his problem?

420
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,092
I mean like what...

421
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,362
Even if we were, what would
we say if we called someone?

422
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:15,462
This guy's following us,
but he doesn't talk to us?

423
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:17,230
We can't call the police.

424
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:19,967
We have nothing to say.

425
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,202
This is ridiculous.

426
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,737
We'll just pay
on our way out.

427
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:31,211
Shit, guys... I
think he's right here.

428
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:31,811
Shit!

429
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:32,479
No he is not...

430
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:35,849
Calm down.

431
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:37,184
Just don't look at him.

432
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:38,418
Hold on.

433
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:39,819
Leo, DO NOT film him!

434
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:40,520
Oh my god!

435
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,821
Stop filming him.

436
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:46,126
No, I wanna see
if I can see him.

437
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,160
Mark, what are you doing?

438
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:48,361
Wait, what are you doing?

439
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:48,996
MARK!

440
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:50,563
Mark, where are you going?

441
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:51,564
Jesus, come back.

442
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:52,632
Don't go outside.

443
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,233
What is he doing?

444
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,201
Is he out of his mind?

445
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:55,335
Oh my god, Oh my god!

446
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:56,203
What is he trying to prove?

447
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:57,370
What is he... Is
he gonna go...?

448
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:58,838
Mark, get away from there.

449
00:13:58,872 --> 00:13:59,940
What are you doing?

450
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,474
Mark!

451
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:02,475
I'm gonna kill him!

452
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,112
No Cassy,
don't go outside.

453
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:08,081
Cassy!

454
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:09,182
Alright, let's go.

455
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:14,521
We need to go.

456
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:17,757
We need to go... NOW!

457
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:26,433
I can't believe
you did that.

458
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:29,302
Don't do that.

459
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:34,541
Did he say anything to you?

460
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:38,478
Mark, did... did he
say anything to you?

461
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,583
Enough with the
camera, Leo!

462
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,018
I'm sorry.

463
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:47,620
Yeah, it's really not cool.

464
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:57,130
You guys, I really
don't know where we are.

465
00:14:57,164 --> 00:14:58,331
You what?

466
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:03,336
I don't know where we are, I
don't recognize any of this.

467
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:06,506
Pull over.

468
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:07,340
Right here?

469
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:08,075
Yes, pull over
and give me the map.

470
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:10,510
Ok, OK!

471
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:11,511
There's just nothing.

472
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:15,615
There's
nothing...

473
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:18,218
Everywhere.

474
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:27,560
Alright,

475
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:38,338
we were on 209, and
then you turned onto... 213.

476
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:43,476
Alright, OK, go up the
road a little bit more.

477
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:48,181
You're going to come
to an intersection,

478
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:49,082
and then take a right.

479
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:52,419
Then go up that
road a little bit.

480
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,154
And then at the next
intersection take a left

481
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,455
and we should be
almost there.

482
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:55,989
Are you sure?

483
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:57,557
Yeah.

484
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,958
Alright.

485
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:03,530
How far away is it
once we do that?

486
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:05,065
Was I right?

487
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:06,199
Are we almost there?

488
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:08,968
Yeah, I think this is
the driveway right here.

489
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:11,071
Are you sure?

490
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:14,241
I'm sure this
is the driveway.

491
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:15,375
- Oh...
- Sweet!

492
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:16,709
I have to piss.

493
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:22,215
I have to pee too.

494
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:24,251
It's time to
drink some beer.

495
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:27,254
[Cheering and laughter]

496
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:30,190
Yes, we are, we deserve it.

497
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:31,391
Especially after today.

498
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:36,229
My bladder is thinking about
bursting in about 5 seconds.

499
00:16:36,263 --> 00:16:37,030
Yeah, do you
have to pee?

500
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:38,131
You guys I think
we're almost here.

501
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:39,732
Yeah, I do.

502
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:40,467
Roll down the windows.

503
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,034
I want to see.

504
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:43,203
What if I tickle you?

505
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:44,304
Why would you do that?

506
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,272
You guys, shine
your flashlights,

507
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,274
I want to see
the house.

508
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,182
This is pretty in the
middle of nowhere.

509
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:55,615
Oooh!!!

510
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:56,416
Oh my god, wow!

511
00:16:56,449 --> 00:17:00,587
Cool.

512
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:01,788
Are we stuck?

513
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:04,791
Are you stuck?

514
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:08,361
We get this far and
then you get stuck?

515
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,263
Alright, Alright.

516
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:11,731
We're parking the car here.

517
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,566
Alright, no just put it
in reverse and then...

518
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:18,838
We made it.
We made it.

519
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,308
We're stuck!

520
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:22,942
Let's just go home.

521
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:23,810
Alright, we're going in.

522
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:24,677
Let's just go.

523
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:28,548
I just pee'd all
over Cassy.

524
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:30,883
It's your fault.

525
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:32,185
We're gone...

526
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:39,159
Oh my god.

527
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:41,128
How does your Aunt Gail
get up this driveway?

528
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:41,994
I don't know.

529
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,896
But check out
that house though.

530
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,699
We get to spend the
whole weekend there.

531
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:47,700
This is going to be
an awesome weekend.

532
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:48,535
It's pretty big.

533
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,636
Yeah.

534
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:50,403
Let's get in there.

535
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:51,171
It's kinda dark.

536
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:52,105
Go, go, go go go.

537
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:55,742
I have to urinate.

538
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,677
Urinate?

539
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:04,117
I have to make urine,
out of my special parts.

540
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:06,753
Go, go, go, go.

541
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:09,322
Alright let's do it.

542
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:18,465
I'm calling the
flashlights.

543
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:21,801
Miriam, I
really have to pee.

544
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,403
Can we just go in?

545
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,004
I'm getting my bag.

546
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,073
Someone get my bag.

547
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,408
Miriam, I swear to God...

548
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,976
Tanya, I'm coming...

549
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,244
I'll dribble all the
way to the door.

550
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:33,946
Nasty!

551
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:45,758
Miriam, got stuck.

552
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,728
That's pretty funny right?

553
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,969
Where is it, where is it?

554
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:59,138
Oh my God, Oh my God!

555
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:01,174
Alright, can you give me the
flashlight so I can see what

556
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,142
I'm doing?

557
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:04,477
Tanya's gonna
piss her pants.

558
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:06,246
I'm glad you find
this amusing you know.

559
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:09,249
Keys are under
the drainpipe.

560
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:10,550
What's a drainpipe?

561
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,319
You don't oh, you don't...

562
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:13,586
I don't know.

563
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,554
I live in Manhattan.

564
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:15,855
Where are the drainpipes?

565
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,357
This is fine, this is fine.

566
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,858
Where are the keys,
where are the keys?

567
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:22,362
Can you guys try to
find a drainpipe?

568
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:23,630
It's right here.

569
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:24,331
Oh hey...

570
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:24,964
Did you find it?

571
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,066
Yeah I see the key.

572
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,308
Put it in.

573
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:35,975
Put it in.

574
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:36,909
I'm trying I'm trying.

575
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:43,550
Open the door
and let me go by.

576
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:54,126
Nice.

577
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,928
It's kind of cold in here.

578
00:19:55,962 --> 00:20:02,168
Does this foyer light work?

579
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,736
Mark, turn the light on.

580
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,972
This is a big house.

581
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:09,208
Are the lights not working?

582
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:11,311
Are you kidding?

583
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:12,111
Try another one.

584
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,381
Maybe that one's broken.

585
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:15,482
The light didn't
work in the bathroom?

586
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:18,885
No it didn't.

587
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:20,953
Just go, just
go, I have to pee.

588
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:24,223
Here, I'll hold
your flashlight.

589
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:24,891
Are you gonna go?

590
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,092
I just went.

591
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:26,659
Well, can you go in there with
me, so I'm not by myself?

592
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,595
Well that was quick.

593
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:30,763
Wait, so none of
these lights work?

594
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:36,336
I guess not.

595
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:39,406
We should be able to
find a fuse or something.

596
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:40,373
Oh my God!

597
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,041
There's no electricity.

598
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,143
At all?

599
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:46,078
No.

600
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:48,581
I don't know.

601
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:53,152
Like maybe if we try
upstairs or something?

602
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:56,389
I mean she knows
we're coming so.

603
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:59,091
You're kidding me,
they're not working.

604
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,460
Like none of them.

605
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:03,663
So now what?

606
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:05,097
Maybe like if we
go around the house

607
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:06,799
there's an outside
one or something,

608
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:10,169
because
it has to be somewhere.

609
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,071
Do you guys see that?

610
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,005
No.

611
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,041
It looks like a
light in the distance.

612
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:15,675
Do you see that?

613
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,745
A flashlight.

614
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,212
It's a car.

615
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:21,013
No Way.

616
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:21,848
That's not a car.

617
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:22,715
That is not.

618
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:23,950
You guys, you
think it might be...

619
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:25,017
Uh, I don't see anything.

620
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:25,852
No, it's not.

621
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:26,986
Guys, everyone get
back inside.

622
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:31,891
You guys, It might be that
guy, it might be that guy.

623
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:34,093
Was that a van?

624
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,261
I don't know.

625
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,597
You guys, we don't
even know if it's him.

626
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,532
Who else would it be?

627
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:40,767
Could it be a
neighbor or somebody?

628
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,669
Guys, could you shut
up, I'm trying to listen.

629
00:21:42,702 --> 00:21:43,503
Did we lock the door?

630
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:45,638
Yes, the door's locked.

631
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:48,007
Alright, hold on the
light's right there.

632
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,809
I see somebody.

633
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:50,309
Ahh!

634
00:21:50,343 --> 00:21:54,614
Shh, Shh, Shut up.

635
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,215
Is he coming?

636
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:57,750
Oh my god.

637
00:21:57,784 --> 00:21:59,151
Mark!

638
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:03,255
Hit him with
your flashlight.

639
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:14,367
[Knocking on door]

640
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:16,202
Miriam?

641
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:16,569
Wait!

642
00:22:16,603 --> 00:22:17,169
What?

643
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:17,770
Miriam?

644
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:19,171
Aunt Gail?

645
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:19,906
Yeah!

646
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:24,911
Oh my God, are
you kidding me?

647
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:27,614
Hi!

648
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:28,848
You scared us.

649
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:29,849
Good to see you.

650
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:31,918
I'm sorry, and I'm so
sorry about the lights.

651
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,085
OK.

652
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,387
We were half way to Maine,
and we realized they forgot

653
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:36,723
to put the power back on
after they did work.

654
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:37,457
Oh.

655
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,827
So that's what
the problem is.

656
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,328
I can't believe you're all
standing here in the dark,

657
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,663
I feel so bad.

658
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,632
We thought we were screwed.

659
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:47,900
Oh no no, I would never
leave you here like this.

660
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:53,139
You would have no hot water,
no kitchen, no nothing.

661
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:54,340
You would really
be in trouble.

662
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,242
No heat... And I think
it's gonna be like

663
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:57,309
40 below this weekend.

664
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:58,177
Oh Oh great.

665
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,680
That would have
been fun right.

666
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,014
You must be Leo.

667
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,650
That's me.

668
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:04,917
I could tell by the camera.

669
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:06,819
And this is
Tanya, Cassy and Mark.

670
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:07,820
Hi you guys.

671
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:08,821
My friends from school.

672
00:23:08,855 --> 00:23:09,922
Hi, nice to meet you,
thank you for having us.

673
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:11,691
Well thanks for spending
her birthday with her.

674
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,926
Happy Birthday!

675
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,628
So glad you
could all come.

676
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:17,630
Thanks for having us.

677
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:18,698
You're gonna
have a lot of fun.

678
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:19,265
Hopefully.

679
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:21,668
But not too much fun.

680
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:23,402
But anyway... Let me
turn the lights on.

681
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:26,673
Let me get everything
settled, and show you how

682
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:27,707
everything works and
where everything is.

683
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,142
Thanks Aunt Gail.

684
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:32,178
How dumb do you feel?

685
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:33,179
Really dumb!

686
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:37,216
This is too
much for one day.

687
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,453
But guys, if we could not
say anything about the guy

688
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:42,489
in the van or the
diner or anything.

689
00:23:42,522 --> 00:23:44,156
I mean, she is
super over-protective.

690
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,959
We're lucky she's even
letting us have this cabin.

691
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:50,429
And if we could just not say
anything that would be great.

692
00:23:50,463 --> 00:23:51,498
That's fine.

693
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:53,800
Yay!

694
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:57,604
Thank you!

695
00:23:57,637 --> 00:23:58,304
Much better right?

696
00:23:58,337 --> 00:23:59,539
Yeah, much better.

697
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:01,307
Thank you so much.

698
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,742
I'm so sorry
about that you guys.

699
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,677
I mean, luckily
we remembered.

700
00:24:04,711 --> 00:24:07,647
We were like eeeek!

701
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,448
I know, I was like
running around outside,

702
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:11,217
and we didn't
know what to do.

703
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,284
So how was your trip?

704
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:13,786
Everything was good?

705
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,988
Cold and snowy.

706
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:18,357
Oh that's right you
drove up in the snow storm.

707
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,292
Oh no.

708
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:21,293
Can't wait to
use the fireplace.

709
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:23,896
Well it's all gonna
get better from here.

710
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:24,664
Yes.

711
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,132
You're gonna
have a great time.

712
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:29,669
You're gonna
relax... the country.

713
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:30,570
So nice.

714
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:31,571
Let me show you how
everything works.

715
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:32,238
Yeah.

716
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:33,806
Thank you so much Aunt Gail.

717
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,341
Alright.

718
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:36,709
I heard every word.

719
00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:38,310
You better not have
heard every word.

720
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:38,845
Leo!

721
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:40,312
Jeez!

722
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:41,914
Gimme the camera.

723
00:24:41,948 --> 00:24:45,151
Nope!

724
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:48,855
OK, everybody, come say
good bye, I gotta go.

725
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:50,189
Happy Birthday!

726
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:52,892
Thank you so much
for everything.

727
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:53,926
Seriously.

728
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,327
Oh, have a really
really really great weekend.

729
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:56,563
It was nice to
meet all of you guys.

00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:42,494
You just farted
right in the fire.

790
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:44,430
You're gonna burn
the house down.

791
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:46,032
Is the fire dying?

792
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:47,734
No, it exploded
when he farted.

793
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:49,401

00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:52,471

O.K.

813
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:38,751
So whoever loses

814
00:28:38,785 --> 00:28:39,551

815
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:40,887
Alright, who wants

816
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,154

00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:49,996
Oh my God, burp.

822
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,902

Stop it guys!

831
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:12,578
Are you really
taking a bubble bath?

832
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:15,381
Get outta here!

833
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:18,484
Look at him, he's
taking a bubble bath.

834
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:21,087
No c'mon, get out!

835
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,390
What's wrong Leo, you don't
like the camera on you?

836
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:27,659
You don't like
it in your face?

837
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:34,666
Nice!

838
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,068
Get out!!!

839
00:30:36,102 --> 00:30:38,137
We're leaving,
we're leaving, OK.

840
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,638
Enjoy your bath.

841
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,374
I will!

842
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:43,242
Good morning.

843
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:45,844
Welcome to cooking with Leo.

844
00:30:45,878 --> 00:30:46,778
Do we have any
Tabasco sauce?

845
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:48,114
Look at the smoke
coming from the pan.

846
00:30:48,147 --> 00:30:50,149
That's really not ok.

847
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,984
We're going, we're going.

848
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:56,522
Bam!

849
00:30:56,555 --> 00:31:02,228

850
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:02,728
Ooh!

851
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:04,763
Ooh, look at that.

852
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:07,299
Perfection.

853
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,101
Cuz it's freakin' freezing!

854
00:31:09,135 --> 00:31:11,737
Leo, looks at
this for a second.

855
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,673
Come here.

856
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,042
Oh my God!

857
00:31:16,075 --> 00:31:18,744
What?

858
00:31:18,777 --> 00:31:19,511
Are you guys
filming my boobs again?

859
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:21,948
What are you filming?

860
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:22,514
Nothing.

861
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,683
You're such an asshole!

862
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,652
It's for Leo, for later.

863
00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:29,521
Oh really...

864
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:30,689
Anyway!

865
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,691
Well, you're shoving it in
our face the whole weekend.

866
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,893
What do you want us to do?

867
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:35,527
Just go with it.

868
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:36,828
Just go with it.

869
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:38,464
Just go with it
man, just go.

870
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:40,632
Just go with the flow.

871
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:42,434
Maybe I'll make a...

872
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:44,170
Put some stuff
together after the weekend.

873
00:31:44,203 --> 00:31:45,104
Yeah, I want a copy.

874
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:46,438
You have to make me a copy.

875
00:31:46,472 --> 00:31:49,942
OK, action.

876
00:31:49,976 --> 00:31:51,343
Watch it!

877
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:52,211
Alright, we're good.

878
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:52,744
OK.

879
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:55,847
So, Take 2.

880
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:56,983
Alright.

881
00:31:57,016 --> 00:32:00,286
So what do you think
about the weekend so far?

882
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:05,924
Um, pretty
hectic, getting here.

883
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:07,626
Pretty crazy, pretty scary.

884
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:08,860
That snow storm was...

885
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:11,163
That was horrible.

886
00:32:11,197 --> 00:32:12,898
And then the windy
road with Tanya.

887
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,034
Oh God, I thought she was
gonna vomit all over me.

888
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:17,803
I know, I felt so bad.

889
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:20,973
Well, we're here now, and
we're gonna have a good time.

890
00:32:21,007 --> 00:32:21,773
Yeah!

891
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:25,077
We're gonna go Sprelunking.

892
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:29,515
Yes, Sprelunking,
we're going sprelunking.

893
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:31,984
With these incredible
flashlights that I got.

894
00:32:32,018 --> 00:32:33,652
Yeah, he's crazy.

895
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:40,592
What do you guys think about
the guy last night, in the van?

896
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:43,662
So tell me some deep dark
secrets about yourself.

897
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:44,796
Some deep dark secrets?

898
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,265
Some really
embarrassing stuff.

899
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,201
I want the
exclusive scoop on you.

900
00:32:49,235 --> 00:32:50,569
I don't know.

901
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:52,971
You gonna make a big
high-budget Hollywood film

902
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:53,505
out of this?

903
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:54,306
Yeah.

904
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,108
I definitely
like documentaries.

905
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:58,444
Like this kinda?

906
00:32:58,477 --> 00:32:59,278
Um...

907
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:00,812
Um...

908
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:02,514
Like civil rights and stuff?

909
00:33:02,548 --> 00:33:04,883
Yeah, like civil
rights, anything on war,

910
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:12,224
race... things that are
taboo in this country?

911
00:33:12,258 --> 00:33:14,560
I love doing
stuff about that.

912
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:20,232
My job, blah, you really want
to talk about my shitty job.

913
00:33:20,266 --> 00:33:21,967
I hate my job.

914
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,370
I really hate my job.

915
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:25,737
I don't like waiting tables.

916
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:28,907
I never have, I never will.

917
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:34,413
And it's the only thing that
seems to be able to keep me

918
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:36,915
in New York,
keep me in school.

919
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:40,486
Allow me to afford
everything, you know.

920
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:43,989
And it sucks.

921
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,725
So what do you think
about the weekend so far?

922
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:49,195
Uh, it'll get better.

923
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:51,397
Oh, yeah you were
sick yesterday.

924
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,765
I felt so bad.

925
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:55,267
The roads were pretty bad.

926
00:33:55,301 --> 00:33:58,237
And then the winding roads?

927
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,571
That probably
didn't help at all.

928
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:01,140
It was terrible.

929
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:02,874
It was so bad.

930
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:07,679
That constant flash before
you have to throw up is...

931
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:12,151
Yeah, I felt pretty
bad, and then uh, the van.

932
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:15,621
That was kinda weird.

933
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:18,790
No, I don't want to get wet,
I don't want to get dirty, I

934
00:34:18,824 --> 00:34:19,825
don't want to get cold...

935
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:20,859
No, it should be fun though.

936
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:24,263
We have snowsuits
and stuff, whatever.

937
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:25,831
I can't move in
those things.

938
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:27,199
Ha, Ha.

939
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:29,768
Get the one piece suit
like in A Christmas Story.

940
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,575
Well alright, thanks
for the interview.

941
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:39,044
I'm gonna go see what
Mark and Cassy are doing.

942
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:39,578
Hmm.

943
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:40,312
O.K.

944
00:34:40,346 --> 00:34:44,350
Wakey, wakey,
eggs and bakey!

945
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:49,388
Time to go.

946
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:56,094
Hey pretty lady,
wanna go cave exploring?

947
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,230
C'mon baby, I'm so sorry
about before and I promise

948
00:34:58,264 --> 00:35:01,133
you, we're gonna
have such a good time.

949
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:03,169
And you know I love you.

950
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:07,406
Please, please please.

951
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,208
And what about Miriam?

952
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:09,841
What about me?

953
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:12,511
It's her birthday.

954
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:16,215
You know you wanna have
a good time for Miriam.

955
00:35:16,248 --> 00:35:21,787
Please, I'm so sorry.

956
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,888
Don't read your
book all day.

957
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:24,890
OK, let's go get Tanya.

958
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:26,425
Tanya!!!

959
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,959
You coming?

960
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:29,595
Please?

961
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,630
She's pretty convincing.

962
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:39,070
Hello, hello?

963
00:35:39,104 --> 00:35:41,740
You ever play
steam-roller Tanya?

964
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:42,941
Steam-roller...

965
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,443
No!

966
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:47,313
Steam-roller!

967
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:48,013
C'mon, time to go.

968
00:35:48,046 --> 00:35:49,114
NO!

969
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,818
C'mon, I heard that there's
these Indian murals and

970
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:53,919
paintings in the caves.

971
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:56,655
I really don't care.

972
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:58,757
You're gonna
want to see them.

973
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,427
They're for your artwork.

974
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,128
And everything that
you love to do, please?

975
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,897
I don't care Mark.

976
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:06,832
Pretty please.

977
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:07,899
I don't care.

978
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:09,368
Do it for the
Indians, please?

979
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:11,337
No.

980
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,271
Do it for Miriam?

981
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:13,205
No.

982
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:13,772
It's her birthday.

983
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:15,507
I love you, but no.

984
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:16,575
I love you.

985
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:18,143
I don't want you to be
here by yourself all day.

986
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:18,710
Because it's cold out Mark.

987
00:36:18,744 --> 00:36:19,678
It's not that cold out.

988
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:21,380
It's about 50
degrees outside.

989
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:23,249
It looks cold out
there, but it's not.

990
00:36:23,282 --> 00:36:24,416
We're gonna have fun.

991
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,484
No we're not.

992
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:26,852
What are you
gonna do out here?

993
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:28,354
I'm gonna be comfy.

994
00:36:28,387 --> 00:36:30,589
Look at this bed.

995
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:32,123
This bed is so nice.

996
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:33,292
You know what's gonna
be even more comfy?

997
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:35,261
After you're out in the cold
for a little bit, having a

998
00:36:35,294 --> 00:36:35,827
good time, then you can
come and crash inside.

999
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:36,395
I don't want to be cold.

1000
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:38,430
I never want to be cold.

1001
00:36:38,464 --> 00:36:40,131
Please?

1002
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:41,132
We're going.

1003
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,468
I'm making you go.

1004
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:43,435
I'm not going.

1005
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:45,003
That's it, you're going.

1006
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:45,837
Mark...

1007
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:49,475
I swear to God...

1008
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:54,780
She's going, I'll
drag her the whole way.

1009
00:36:54,813 --> 00:36:57,549
Aw, don't you feel
bad for them Leo?

1010
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:59,518
No!

1011
00:37:19,638 --> 00:37:22,240
This is what comes when you
try to push your girlfriend

1012
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:24,710
in the snow, and
she's stronger than you.

1013
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,345
How do you feel
about that Mark?

1014
00:37:26,378 --> 00:37:29,848
That almost makes
this worth it, actually.

1015
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:33,452
Do that a couple more times
Mark, and we might be even.

1016
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:41,893
Come here love of my life.

1017
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:59,077
What?

1018
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,512
What is that?

1019
00:38:00,546 --> 00:38:01,680
Well there's a
shot for you Leo.

1020
00:38:03,549 --> 00:38:06,752
Oh, that's
pretty disgusting.

1021
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:11,790
Why would we go that way if
we came from the other way?

1022
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:13,459
That's the way we came.

1023
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:14,259
That's not the way we came.

1024
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:18,664
That's the way we came.

1025
00:38:18,697 --> 00:38:21,066
I promise you that we
basically went in a

1026
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,634
generally
straight direction.

1027
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:24,470
So if we go back
the way we came.

1028
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:25,604
I don't remember a
straight direction.

1029
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:30,108
We basically went in a
generally straight direction?

1030
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,978
Can you please knock the
pride act off, and just

1031
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:35,647
admit that we're lost.

1032
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:37,015
I'm not being
proud right now.

1033
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,918
I'm just saying
that we...

1034
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:41,219
Why would I
want us to

1035
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,355
be more in the
woods than we are?

1036
00:38:43,389 --> 00:38:48,960
OK, now this is the way
we went, so let's just go.

1037
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:52,230
Well we went the way you
guys suggested, not the way

1038
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,965
I wanted to go.

1039
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,401
I said we should go the
other way, you guys wanted

1040
00:38:55,434 --> 00:38:58,236
to go back along the path
of the waterfall right?

1041
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:03,008
Well, oh, let's take this
unknown unmarked way that.

1042
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:05,043
Mark suggests, or take
the path that we've already

1043
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:07,379
taken and know that leads
to a certain direction.

1044
00:39:07,413 --> 00:39:10,048
That's not what we did.

1045
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:13,018
He's YOUR boyfriend.

1046
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:14,586
So it's MY fault now?

1047
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,021
No, I'm just
saying talk to him.

1048
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:19,124
Did you try your
cell phone?

1049
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:22,561
Well if there's no service
in the house, why would

1050
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:24,029
there be
service in the woods?

1051
00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:24,830
I don't know.

1052
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:29,968
Maybe... it's
worth a shot, right?

1053
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:32,438
What about your
walkie-talkie?

1054
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:37,275
There's no one to
talk to on the channel.

1055
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:40,378
We can try
some channels?

1056
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:52,157
Does anybody see
anything around that...

1057
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,324
I don't see a
God-Damned thing!

1058
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:56,462
OK, calm down for one second
and let me ask a question.

1059
00:39:56,495 --> 00:39:59,598
Do you see anything that you
might have noticed earlier,

1060
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:00,298
anybody?

1061
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,400
Trees?

1062
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:07,038
Would you knock off the
act Tanya, I'm over it.

1063
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:08,474
I'm over this too.

1064
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:11,543
Yeah, so is everybody,
join the fucking club!

1065
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:15,747
Look around, maybe you
saw something weird,

1066
00:40:15,781 --> 00:40:17,816
just look around.

1067
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:22,053
There was that deer thing.

1068
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:22,888
Wait, where's Miriam?

1069
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,222
Well, we can't just keep...

1070
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,358
Cassy, are you OK?

1071
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:30,696
Careful guys, OK?

1072
00:40:30,729 --> 00:40:32,564
Did you just
say careful guys?

1073
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:34,199
Did you honestly
just say careful guys?

1074
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:35,366
What is your problem?

1075
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,636
Look, I didn't even
want to get out here.

1076
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:38,403
No one forced you to come.

1077
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,105
No, you convinced me.

1078
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:41,172
All you've done all weekend
is bitch and moan and...

1079
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:42,240
You convinced me that
everything would be ok and

1080
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,174
we are now lost.

1081
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:45,076
Criticize me for nothing.

1082
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:45,577
For nothing?

1083
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:46,912
Look where we are?

1084
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:47,713
You're leading us.

1085
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:49,648
You can't put
all of this on me.

1086
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:51,650
The entire trip
you've blamed this on me.

1087
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:53,752
For your own
little insecurities.

1088
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,053
Now let's just keep going!

1089
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:56,087
But going where?

1090
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:57,656
What insecurities
Mark, please enlighten me.

1091
00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:59,157
Guys, guys, guys,
please knock it off.

1092
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,526
Time out.

1093
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:03,695
Shh, Shh!

1094
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:07,032
What was that?

1095
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:09,300
Shine your light over there.

1096
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:17,275
Did you hear that?

1097
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:22,681
Yeah, did you?

1098
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:25,150
Let's just keep
going this way.

1099
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:30,155
It's probably just a
bird or something.

1100
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:33,859
Wait, Wait!

1101
00:41:33,892 --> 00:41:34,560
It was just an animal.

1102
00:41:34,593 --> 00:41:36,728
It was just a bird.

1103
00:41:36,762 --> 00:41:37,563
Did you hear something?

1104
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:40,732
That's a pretty big bird.

1105
00:41:40,766 --> 00:41:41,900
Let's go.

1106
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:43,334
Aren't there supposed to be
bears out in these woods?

1107
00:41:43,368 --> 00:41:44,002
God, don't do that.

1108
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:44,703
Don't do that!

1109
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:46,137
Please don't say that OK?

1110
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,039
I'm just saying we should
think about the reality of

1111
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:49,608
the situation if
there's bears out here.

1112
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:51,643
I'd prefer not to.

1113
00:41:51,677 --> 00:41:54,512
Shh, Shh!!!

1114
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:55,881
Oh shit, you guys!

1115
00:41:55,914 --> 00:41:57,282
Shh!

1116
00:41:57,315 --> 00:42:01,052
What the fuck kind of
animal makes that noise?

1117
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:05,557
What the fuck is that?

1118
00:42:05,591 --> 00:42:08,694
You guys, c'mon.

1119
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:11,029
I don't see anything.

1120
00:42:16,434 --> 00:42:18,136
There's animal
tracks everywhere.

1121
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:22,240
They're all
fucking animal tracks.

1122
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:29,180
Fuck, fuck, fuck me!

1123
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,922
Do you see anything?

1124
00:42:36,955 --> 00:42:38,489
Oh god.

1125
00:42:38,523 --> 00:42:42,493
That scared the shit out
of me Tanya, knock it off.

1126
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:49,134
Yeah, but it's far away.

1127
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:50,636
It's some
animal in the woods.

1128
00:42:50,669 --> 00:42:51,837
It's not a big deal.

1129
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:52,370
What kind of animal do
you know that makes

1130
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:52,938
that kind of sound?

1131
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:53,705
A bird, I don't know.

1132
00:42:53,739 --> 00:42:57,508
It's still there.

1133
00:42:57,542 --> 00:42:58,309
That's a bird.

1134
00:42:58,343 --> 00:43:00,211
That's not a
fucking bird Tanya!

1135
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:04,850
NO shit, it's not a bird!

1136
00:43:04,883 --> 00:43:07,152
Mark, is your
walkie-talkie on?

1137
00:43:07,185 --> 00:43:09,788
No, you won't get
any channels out here.

1138
00:43:09,821 --> 00:43:11,289
Well, what is that then?

1139
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:11,723
I don't know.

1140
00:43:11,757 --> 00:43:13,291
Just static.

1141
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:14,525
Anybody?

1142
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,061
Did you hear that?

1143
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:16,527
What was that?

1144
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:18,029
What WAS that?

1145
00:43:18,063 --> 00:43:20,031
What was that?

1146
00:43:20,065 --> 00:43:20,732
Holy shit!

1147
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:22,100
Run!

1148
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:23,268
Guys, stop!!!

1149
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:25,470
Guys stop!!!

1150
00:43:25,503 --> 00:43:27,305
Stop, don't run.

1151
00:43:29,507 --> 00:43:31,409
God dammit, stop!

1152
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,612
Oh shut up Mark, let's go!

1153
00:43:34,646 --> 00:43:36,447
Shit, we lost
them, we lost them.

1154
00:43:36,481 --> 00:43:39,851
Guys C'mon!

1155
00:43:39,885 --> 00:43:43,121
What WAS that?

1156
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:44,522
What are you guys doing?

1157
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:45,523
Stop running.

1158
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:48,559
Let's go, let's
go, let's go.

1159
00:43:56,267 --> 00:44:02,941
Stop running, God Dammit, it
was just a fucking branch.

1160
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:03,742
You hear that?

1161
00:44:03,775 --> 00:44:05,210
What?

1162
00:44:05,243 --> 00:44:07,412
Is that water?

1163
00:44:07,445 --> 00:44:10,481
Why are you laughing?

1164
00:44:10,515 --> 00:44:12,083
You son-of-a-bitch,
are you laughing?

1165
00:44:12,117 --> 00:44:13,885
It's the waterfall.

1166
00:44:18,023 --> 00:44:20,892
Wait, the waterfall is
near the house, isn't it?

1167
00:44:20,926 --> 00:44:22,427
Yeah, we can't be far.

1168
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:25,196
We just keep going
this way and around.

1169
00:44:26,798 --> 00:44:30,201
Oh, thank God.

1170
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:35,573
It's getting louder.

1171
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:38,009
Oh, I never heard anything
that good in my life.

1172
00:44:38,043 --> 00:44:39,978
Wait, what's that light.

1173
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:43,581
Oh my God, Oh my God!

1174
00:44:51,957 --> 00:44:55,927
I think we just take
these footsteps this way.

1175
00:44:57,996 --> 00:44:59,998
Miriam, it's your birthday.

1176
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,598
Happy Birthday.

1177
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:05,603
Happy Birthday!

1178
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:07,338
Thank God.

1179
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:10,041
We made it.

1180
00:45:10,075 --> 00:45:12,477
Yes!

1181
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:21,486
Oh, you're such a jackass.

1182
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:23,789
I can't believe you
recorded us the whole time...

1183
00:45:23,822 --> 00:45:25,590
You're crazy.

1184
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:36,734
Oh, my God, my
hands are freezing.

1185
00:45:36,768 --> 00:45:39,570
Let me just take a
moment to adore this.

1186
00:45:39,604 --> 00:45:45,676
This is a
beautiful wonderful...

1187
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:47,879
Where did Aunt
Gail get this?

1188
00:45:47,913 --> 00:45:50,415
She really likes
Halloween, I don't know.

1189
00:45:50,448 --> 00:45:53,451
Don't ask me.

1190
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:55,821
What are we
having for dinner?

1191
00:45:55,854 --> 00:45:58,156
I believe pasta
if that's cool.

1192
00:45:58,189 --> 00:46:00,725
And who's cooking it.

1193
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:01,626
I'm not cooking.

1194
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:02,427
I can't cook.

1195
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,428
C'mon!

1196
00:46:03,461 --> 00:46:04,595
And you don't
want me to cook.

1197
00:46:04,629 --> 00:46:07,398
I'm hungry!

1198
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:09,400
Oh, no.

1199
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:11,136
You look like my mom.

1200
00:46:11,169 --> 00:46:16,107
You're mom, I
look like Shirley?

1201
00:46:16,141 --> 00:46:22,147
Leo, Leo let's talk about
this trip you're going on

1202
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:23,614
with your friends?

1203
00:46:23,648 --> 00:46:24,916
OK?

1204
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:29,654
Sit down, sit down, alright.

1205
00:46:29,687 --> 00:46:36,394
Leo, are there
gonna be girls on this trip?

1206
00:46:36,427 --> 00:46:36,895
Yeah mom.

1207
00:46:36,928 --> 00:46:37,896
Answer me!

1208
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:40,832
Mom, they're gonna be
in separate bedrooms.

1209
00:46:40,866 --> 00:46:45,403
Leo, did you pack
some condoms honey?

1210
00:46:45,436 --> 00:46:47,538
Did ya?

1211
00:46:47,572 --> 00:46:52,577
I'm serious right now!

1212
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:54,579
Did ya?

1213
00:46:54,612 --> 00:47:01,286
I don't trust
those WHOO-ERS.

1214
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:06,624
I don't trust those
sluts, but I trust my baby!

1215
00:47:10,896 --> 00:47:13,598
Does anyone else
want to try it on?

1216
00:47:13,631 --> 00:47:15,733
I think you should go for it
Tanya, I don't think my hair

1217
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:17,702
can fit in that thing.

1218
00:47:17,735 --> 00:47:19,905
You don't want to try it on?

1219
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:26,077
How'd you finish
your food that fast?

1220
00:47:26,111 --> 00:47:28,446
I was freakin' hungry.

[Phone ringing]

1222
00:47:56,541 --> 00:48:00,745
I'm not gonna
answer my Aunt's phone.

1223
00:48:00,778 --> 00:48:02,547
You think I should?

1224
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:07,318
I don't know.

1225
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:16,361
Hello?

1226
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:22,433
They hung up.

1227
00:48:22,467 --> 00:48:25,103
Mark, did you forget to call
your mother this weekend?

1228
00:48:25,136 --> 00:48:31,276
I did, she's very
overprotective.

1229
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:36,647
You love my
mother, don't make fun.

1230
00:48:36,681 --> 00:48:38,049
I love your mother!

1231
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:39,084
Oh!

1232
00:48:39,117 --> 00:48:39,951
I love YOUR mother too Leo.

1234
00:48:42,954 --> 00:48:46,724
I LOVE your mother.

Hello?

1236
00:48:49,227 --> 00:48:55,266
Hello?

1237
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,736
Again, no one.

1238
00:49:04,742 --> 00:49:14,852
So, I'd like to make a toast
if I may, to forgiveness, to

1239
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:21,326
birthdays and
friendship and a great time.

1240

That's weird.

1243
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:52,823
There's no car here.

1244
00:49:52,857 --> 00:49:53,758
Who's there?

1245
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:55,693
Is that any
neighbors or anything?

1246
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:57,062
You'd have to have
a car to get here.

1247
00:49:57,095 --> 00:49:59,297
It's miles from anyone.

1248
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:04,835
Who's there?

1249
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:06,904
Who's there?

1250
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,486
You see anybody?

1251
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:22,687
There's no one there.

1252
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,789
What?

1253
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:32,697
Don't open the door!

1254
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:04,462
What is that?

1255
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:15,005
What is it?

1256
00:51:23,681 --> 00:51:26,050
What the hell.

1257
00:51:30,121 --> 00:51:32,923
You wanna play it?

1258
00:51:32,957 --> 00:51:35,960
Let's just play it.

1259
00:51:46,637 --> 00:51:47,772
You guys didn't
see anything?

1260
00:51:47,805 --> 00:51:49,039
Not one car?

1261
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:28,913
Wait a second.

1262
00:52:28,946 --> 00:52:30,181
That's my car.

1263
00:52:30,215 --> 00:52:33,184
That's us.

1264
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:37,322
That's the guy in
that fucking van.

1265
00:52:37,355 --> 00:52:38,723
Remember the van?

1266
00:52:38,756 --> 00:52:39,924
No!

1267
00:52:39,957 --> 00:52:43,294
It has to be.

1268
00:52:53,571 --> 00:52:54,272
That means he
followed us up here.

1269
00:52:54,305 --> 00:52:58,042
He followed us up here.

1270
00:53:46,424 --> 00:53:48,058

That's the house.

00:54:18,689 --> 00:54:21,426
He's been here the

1276
00:54:51,322 --> 00:54:53,324
I don't want to
watch this anymore.

1277
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:56,026
Turn it off.

1278
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,962

00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:06,397
The phone's ringing.

1293
00:56:06,431 --> 00:56:08,633
I'm not
answering the phone.

1294
00:56:11,636 --> 00:56:14,304
Answer the phone.

1295
00:56:14,338 --> 00:56:16,641

1296
00:56:16,674 --> 00:56:17,775
I don't care about
the phone right now.

1297
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:18,776

What?

1308
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,736
It was just ringing.

1309
00:56:50,775 --> 00:56:51,942
He cut the phone line.

1310
00:56:51,976 --> 00:56:55,145
What do you mean he
cut the phone line?

1311

If he comes back just try

1400
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:47,958
Why do we need the
camera, I'm not recording.
