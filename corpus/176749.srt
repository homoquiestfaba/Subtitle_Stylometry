1
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:38,035
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

2
00:02:47,887 --> 00:02:49,081
Barbara?

3
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:59,525
Did you hear that? I could have sworn
I heard whispering.

4
00:03:01,207 --> 00:03:03,323
You're reading my mind, thaùs all.

5
00:03:03,807 --> 00:03:05,798
My thoughts sound like whispers.

6
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:07,476
Yeah?

7
00:03:07,967 --> 00:03:09,605
What were you thinking?

8
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:11,760
I love you, Doc.

9
00:03:12,287 --> 00:03:15,757
You sure make it fun to wake up
before dawn, I'll tell you that.

10
00:04:32,047 --> 00:04:33,036
Frank?

11
00:04:50,407 --> 00:04:52,967
- Did you finish last night?
- No.

12
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:56,562
Honey, iùs a quarter to 6:00.

13
00:04:57,247 --> 00:04:58,475
Iùs important.

14
00:04:59,447 --> 00:05:00,436
Okay.

15
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:04,956
Thanks.

16
00:05:17,207 --> 00:05:18,196
Okay.

17
00:05:19,047 --> 00:05:20,446
Thaùs everything.

18
00:05:22,527 --> 00:05:24,119
Helium for the balloons!

19
00:05:24,207 --> 00:05:27,643
I'm picking up a tank at HarolÔs
right after I drop you off...

20
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,399
...per your instructions.

21
00:05:29,487 --> 00:05:31,842
Did I think of that? Cool.

22
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,404
I must be starting to get
this delegating authority stuff.

23
00:05:35,687 --> 00:05:39,566
Well, Mrs. Magoo,
I guess thaùs why they made you principal.

24
00:05:40,487 --> 00:05:41,602
I guess so.

25
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:47,276
- Honey, don't smoke.
- Come on! You're going to make me crash.

26
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:51,283
I'll quit smoking when you decide
to get pregnant, all right?

27
00:06:01,887 --> 00:06:02,956
Guys!

28
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:10,758
- Hi!
- Hi.

29
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:18,959
- Be careful.
- Here I come.

30
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,406
Watch your step.

31
00:06:26,247 --> 00:06:27,441
You all right?

32
00:06:29,687 --> 00:06:30,676
Jill!

33
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:37,198
- Who's the chef?
- Oliver.

34
00:06:37,287 --> 00:06:39,403
Great, I love burnt hot dogs.

35
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:42,324
Thanks. So when's Ben coming home?

36
00:06:42,407 --> 00:06:45,843
Six weeks, four days and nine hours.

37
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:51,200
- Okay, watch the edges. Don't spill it.
- I got it.

38
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:53,039
Leùs take it over here.

39
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:56,006
- Callie, how are you?
- Frank. Good. Good to see you.

40
00:06:56,087 --> 00:06:57,486
Where's my helium?

41
00:06:57,887 --> 00:07:01,197
- Say you love me, baby.
- Not until you get me my helium.

42
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,762
Righty-o. I'll get right on it, dear.

43
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:08,523
- You go here.
- Okay.

44
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:11,167
There's Jill. I've got those receipts here.

45
00:07:12,087 --> 00:07:14,317
- How you doing?
- How the hell are you?

46
00:07:15,607 --> 00:07:17,837
- All right, bye.
- Bye. See you later.

47
00:07:29,247 --> 00:07:30,999
- Barbara!
- Frank!

48
00:07:33,527 --> 00:07:34,846
Good morning, Sam.

49
00:07:34,927 --> 00:07:37,964
And you must be Cindy.
Iùs nice to finally meet you.

50
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:42,317
Do you want to take a look around?

51
00:07:43,807 --> 00:07:45,445
You'll really love this place.

52
00:08:01,527 --> 00:08:03,199
- Harold.
- Morning, Doc.

53
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,397
- Frank.
- Doc, how the hell are you?

54
00:08:05,927 --> 00:08:07,918
Heading over to the school fair?

55
00:08:08,007 --> 00:08:11,079
I have to go to Butler County and
make my rounds at the hospital.

56
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:13,362
You've got to try
this muscle machine I made.

57
00:08:13,447 --> 00:08:15,324
Show everybody how strong you are.

58
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:16,317
I don't know.

59
00:08:16,407 --> 00:08:20,195
I should probably sit in the shade
and watch you young guys do it.

60
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:24,679
- See you, tough guy.
- Right.

61
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:33,196
Okay. Thanks, Jill.

62
00:08:33,287 --> 00:08:34,879
We need finger paints.

63
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,799
Okay. I'll get them.

64
00:08:38,527 --> 00:08:40,040
Just put it on the table.

65
00:08:53,647 --> 00:08:55,524
Finger paints. Okay.

66
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:05,156
Yikes.

67
00:10:43,687 --> 00:10:45,996
<i>Well, a civilian pilot spots the smoke.</i>

68
00:10:46,407 --> 00:10:50,116
<i>Then I get here and find two</i>
<i>of my officers passed out like babies.</i>

69
00:10:50,327 --> 00:10:53,285
<i>Everything on that side</i>
<i>of the white line is out cold.</i>

70
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:56,719
<i>So somebody starts talking</i>
<i>about chemical weapons...</i>

71
00:10:56,807 --> 00:11:00,561
<i>... and somebody hits a panic button,</i>
<i>and then you people are calling.</i>

72
00:11:01,647 --> 00:11:04,241
- There you go.
- <i>Look, there is no research lab.</i>

73
00:11:04,327 --> 00:11:06,238
<i>There is no chemical plant.</i>

74
00:11:06,447 --> 00:11:10,076
<i>There is no toxic waste dump.</i>
<i>There is no nuclear plant!</i>

75
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:12,602
- There's no nothing around here.
- Okay.

76
00:11:14,767 --> 00:11:18,316
Nothing on the news channels
or news services. Nobody's got it yet.

77
00:11:18,407 --> 00:11:19,396
Good.

78
00:11:21,487 --> 00:11:24,524
I'm just going to take myself in there
and get a look-see.

79
00:11:34,087 --> 00:11:35,076
Ed.

80
00:11:35,447 --> 00:11:38,325
- Thaùs Frank McGowan's truck, right?
- Whaùs left of it.

81
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:41,683
- Lucky you weren't in town today, Doc.
- Whaùs going on here?

82
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,804
Nobody knows anything,
not even that fed doctor down there.

83
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:48,482
She brought this whole circus with her,
and they don't have a clue.

84
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:05,397
Go on out there and see
what the hell's going on. Be careful.

85
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:07,717
- Stay here?
- Yeah, we're just waiting.

86
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:09,326
All right, good.

87
00:12:29,727 --> 00:12:32,321
Pull him back!
Get him out of there! Leùs go!

88
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:36,481
Get him down!

89
00:12:36,727 --> 00:12:38,365
- Stay back!
- Excuse me.

90
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:41,157
Hits him like a hammer.
Thaùs all we know.

91
00:12:41,247 --> 00:12:43,886
- Some kind of chemical gas?
- No, it can't be.

92
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:46,766
The edges of the affected area
are well-defined.

93
00:12:47,607 --> 00:12:48,642
Stationary.

94
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,560
- Doc, this is Dr. Susan...
- Vurner.

95
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:53,799
Like Turner, with a "V."

96
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:56,641
Epidemiologist,
National Science Foundation.

97
00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:58,558
- Alan Chaffee.
- MD?

98
00:12:58,847 --> 00:13:02,123
He's breathing. Good pulse.
I think he just fainted.

99
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:04,319
Is Midwich affected by this?

100
00:13:04,407 --> 00:13:06,762
- My hunch would be, yes.
- My wife's in Midwich.

101
00:13:06,847 --> 00:13:10,476
We tried calling for the last six hours.
Nobody picks up or calls out.

102
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:13,764
Could somebody please get me
some blood and urine samples?

103
00:13:16,247 --> 00:13:18,124
- Whaùs the call?
- 98.

104
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:21,758
You going? Okay, all right.

105
00:13:22,607 --> 00:13:25,201
Just take it easy.
Somebody get him a blanket.

106
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:21,366
What happened?

107
00:15:23,527 --> 00:15:24,516
Barbara?

108
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:28,078
Thank God. Are you all right?

109
00:15:30,447 --> 00:15:32,085
Sweetheart, are you okay?

110
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,997
- I'm cold.
- All right, come on. Leùs go home.

111
00:16:20,607 --> 00:16:21,596
No.

112
00:16:25,327 --> 00:16:26,726
<i>Heavenly Father...</i>

113
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:30,046
...we mourn these lives cut short...

114
00:16:30,807 --> 00:16:33,526
...without warning or apparent purpose.

115
00:16:34,287 --> 00:16:37,404
We search for a reason and find none.

116
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,079
We have become accustomed
to the power of science...

117
00:16:42,527 --> 00:16:46,486
...so when we were struck down,
we turned to science and asked, "Why?"

118
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:49,245
But it could not answer.

119
00:16:50,047 --> 00:16:52,436
So now we turn our eyes toward Heaven...

120
00:16:52,807 --> 00:16:56,356
...and seek our comfort
in GoÔs infinite mercy.

121
00:16:57,967 --> 00:16:59,116
Let us pray.

122
00:17:00,327 --> 00:17:02,887
"Our Father, who art in Heaven...

123
00:17:03,327 --> 00:17:04,885
<i>"...hallowed be Thy name...</i>

124
00:17:04,967 --> 00:17:07,686
<i>"...Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done...</i>

125
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:09,758
<i>"...on Earth as it is in Heaven.</i>

126
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:12,840
<i>"Give us this day our daily bread...</i>

127
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:15,283
<i>"...and forgive us our trespasses...</i>

128
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,245
<i>"...as we forgive those</i>
<i>who trespass against us...</i>

129
00:17:18,607 --> 00:17:20,837
<i>"...and lead us not into temptation...</i>

130
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,759
<i>"...but deliver us from evil.</i>

131
00:17:22,847 --> 00:17:25,600
<i>"For Thine is the kingdom, and the power...</i>

132
00:17:25,687 --> 00:17:28,281
<i>"...and the glory, forever and ever.</i>

133
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:29,556
<i>"Amen."</i>

134
00:18:09,927 --> 00:18:12,077
Did you ever hear of Charles Fort?

135
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:16,646
He wrote <i>The Book of the Damned</i>,
about unexplainable things.

136
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:20,558
Like frogs falling from the sky,
blue snow, red rain...

137
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:22,604
Are you suggesting I read him?

138
00:18:22,687 --> 00:18:24,325
No. Iùs just that...

139
00:18:25,047 --> 00:18:27,481
Sometimes mysteries don't get solved.

140
00:18:28,127 --> 00:18:30,925
I mean, what if something
like this happens again?

141
00:18:31,047 --> 00:18:33,607
I don't know. What do I do?
Can I call you?

142
00:18:33,687 --> 00:18:35,757
Well, of course, you can call me.

143
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:40,326
By the way,
I suggest you read Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

144
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:42,405
Sherlock Holmes once said:

145
00:18:42,607 --> 00:18:46,805
"When you've eliminated the impossible,
whatever remains, however improbable...

146
00:18:46,927 --> 00:18:48,440
"...must be the truth."

147
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:12,559
Iùs not possible.

148
00:19:13,727 --> 00:19:16,605
You made a mistake. Do it again.

149
00:19:18,007 --> 00:19:20,726
Well, I don't have a problem
running the tests again...

150
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:24,959
I have felt like this before in the morning.
It is just some kind of bug.

151
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:42,556
Melanie?

152
00:19:57,887 --> 00:19:59,286
Whaùs the matter?

153
00:20:04,047 --> 00:20:06,083
- Maybe I can help.
- No.

154
00:20:06,687 --> 00:20:07,756
You can't.

155
00:20:13,607 --> 00:20:15,040
- There they are!
- Hey, guys!

156
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:17,357
We're empty! We need some more here!

157
00:20:17,727 --> 00:20:19,319
Hi, how are you?

158
00:20:20,007 --> 00:20:21,360
Iùs good to see you.

159
00:20:21,447 --> 00:20:22,436
Hi.

160
00:20:29,647 --> 00:20:31,319
Ben, this is fantastic.

161
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:43,358
Callie, look up and smile.

162
00:20:50,807 --> 00:20:52,877
Ben, after a year in Japan...

163
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:56,277
...did you ever think you'd have
to get used to being a dad?

164
00:21:14,487 --> 00:21:15,602
Hello, Doc.

165
00:21:18,447 --> 00:21:19,766
I said, "Hello."

166
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:24,884
- How long have you been standing there?
- Ages.

167
00:21:25,207 --> 00:21:26,196
Liar.

168
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:30,606
Big boy.

169
00:21:36,687 --> 00:21:38,678
Why are you kissing me like that?

170
00:21:40,087 --> 00:21:43,159
I wanted to know first,
so I used a home pregnancy kit.

171
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:46,680
Honey, you know those are unreliable.

172
00:21:47,127 --> 00:21:50,199
And thaùs why I went to see
Dr. Cornright just to make sure.

173
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:51,960
Are you going to open it?

174
00:22:00,647 --> 00:22:01,762
Alan?

175
00:22:11,327 --> 00:22:13,045
Hi. You got a minute?

176
00:22:13,247 --> 00:22:14,236
Sure.

177
00:22:27,007 --> 00:22:28,679
Everything's positive.

178
00:22:29,607 --> 00:22:31,006
You are pregnant.

179
00:22:36,927 --> 00:22:39,122
We'd been trying, you know.

180
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:41,241
Look.

181
00:22:42,207 --> 00:22:45,677
I wanted to tell you something
before you hear it from somebody else.

182
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:48,285
There are a lot of pregnancies.

183
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,005
I mean, a lot.

184
00:22:51,007 --> 00:22:54,317
Much more than would
normally be expected.

185
00:22:55,687 --> 00:22:57,245
What do you mean?

186
00:23:01,687 --> 00:23:03,598
Is something wrong with my baby?

187
00:23:04,087 --> 00:23:08,319
No, iùs nothing to indicate that.
You're a normal, healthy young woman...

188
00:23:08,407 --> 00:23:11,240
Alan, don't talk to me like a doctor.

189
00:23:12,367 --> 00:23:13,436
Okay.

190
00:23:15,167 --> 00:23:18,955
All the pregnancies seem to date
from the day of the blackout.

191
00:23:19,127 --> 00:23:20,526
No!

192
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:34,119
<i>Dr. Susan Vurner has flown in</i>...

193
00:23:34,207 --> 00:23:37,005
This is all because of that blackout, isn't it?

194
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:41,403
- Just come out and say something!
- They don't know for sure!

195
00:23:41,647 --> 00:23:43,683
They are all going to be deformed!

196
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:48,838
Wait a minute. Thaùs not true!

197
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,317
Excuse me! Thaùs not true.
There's no reason to believe that.

198
00:23:52,407 --> 00:23:55,205
Barbara and I are pregnant.
We know how you feel.

199
00:23:55,287 --> 00:23:58,040
We know what you are thinking,
so let me say right now...

200
00:23:58,127 --> 00:24:00,766
...the same thing
I've told a lot of you individually.

201
00:24:00,847 --> 00:24:03,645
The standard tests have not revealed
one abnormality.

202
00:24:03,727 --> 00:24:06,400
Anywhere. Not one. All right?

203
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:09,524
Leùs listen to Dr. Vurner, please.

204
00:24:09,607 --> 00:24:13,122
She's come to talk to us.
Dr. Susan Vurner, ladies and gentlemen.

205
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:19,885
I want to start off by saying we are all
very concerned about your well-being.

206
00:24:22,047 --> 00:24:25,244
But ultimately it will come down
to individual decisions.

207
00:24:25,887 --> 00:24:29,846
And I understand that these decisions
will be probably the most intimate...

208
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:34,125
...personal, difficult decisions
that you ever make in your life.

209
00:24:34,647 --> 00:24:39,163
However, because your pregnancies
have attracted intense scientific interest...

210
00:24:39,247 --> 00:24:43,081
...including the National Institutes of
Health and National Science Foundation...

211
00:24:43,207 --> 00:24:46,165
...those of you who decide
to have your child...

212
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,916
...will have all prenatal expenses paid.

213
00:24:49,047 --> 00:24:52,722
You'll also receive $3,000 monthly
as an allowance.

214
00:24:55,087 --> 00:25:00,241
If you allow your child to be examined
and tested on some sort of regular basis.

215
00:25:00,487 --> 00:25:03,047
Is that $3,000 a family?

216
00:25:03,247 --> 00:25:06,045
What if your wife and your daughter
both have kids?

217
00:25:06,287 --> 00:25:08,642
Then you would receive $6,000.

218
00:25:09,327 --> 00:25:11,158
$6,000?

219
00:25:14,687 --> 00:25:19,397
I don't want you to interpret this allowance
as some sort of a pressure.

220
00:25:19,927 --> 00:25:21,565
It isn't. Iùs your decision.

221
00:25:21,647 --> 00:25:26,562
If you decide to terminate then, of course,
you have the right to do that.

222
00:25:27,447 --> 00:25:29,085
You can do it privately.

223
00:25:29,207 --> 00:25:32,995
Or if financially unable, a medical team
will be brought in next week.

224
00:25:33,607 --> 00:25:36,167
- The choice is yours.
- Thaùs killing babies.

225
00:25:42,727 --> 00:25:44,604
Are you okay?

226
00:25:46,047 --> 00:25:47,878
Ben's moving out.

227
00:25:50,127 --> 00:25:51,845
He won't believe me.

228
00:25:54,367 --> 00:25:55,925
What are you going to do?

229
00:25:57,607 --> 00:25:59,086
I can't keep it.

230
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:02,203
I mean, it can't be Ben's.

231
00:26:03,607 --> 00:26:05,404
I just don't...

232
00:26:05,807 --> 00:26:07,843
I just don't understand.

233
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:13,118
Something very strange is happening
to all of us, Callie.

234
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,284
You know, they say...

235
00:26:18,127 --> 00:26:20,322
...the Roberts' girl is a virgin.

236
00:26:23,327 --> 00:26:24,965
What are you going to do?

237
00:26:26,327 --> 00:26:27,680
I don't know.

238
00:26:30,687 --> 00:26:32,006
I don't know.

239
00:27:25,607 --> 00:27:27,643
- You all right?
- Yeah.

240
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,484
It was just a dream.

241
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:35,476
Okay.

242
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:40,444
Leùs go back to sleep.

243
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:52,645
Whaùs going on, doctor?

244
00:27:53,447 --> 00:27:54,766
Nothing.

245
00:27:56,527 --> 00:27:59,325
They have apparently decided
to keep their babies.

246
00:27:59,687 --> 00:28:00,881
All of them?

247
00:28:01,407 --> 00:28:02,601
Why?

248
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,638
Thaùs a very good question.

249
00:29:18,807 --> 00:29:20,798
Keep pushing! Push!

250
00:29:21,767 --> 00:29:23,962
Okay, here we go. Here we go. Almost.

251
00:29:24,047 --> 00:29:26,641
Almost done! Good, Mom. Thaùs good.

252
00:29:26,847 --> 00:29:28,917
Push, push, push.

253
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:36,080
Thaùs it. Thaùs it.

254
00:29:38,327 --> 00:29:40,716
You're doing great! Take a deep breath.

255
00:29:40,807 --> 00:29:42,559
Deep breath and push!

256
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:44,319
Push, push, push!

257
00:29:44,727 --> 00:29:47,161
Come with that. Push a little more.

258
00:29:47,927 --> 00:29:51,078
- Push, Barbara, push.
- A little more. A little more.

259
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:53,084
Push. Push.

260
00:29:58,247 --> 00:29:59,885
Help me!

261
00:30:00,887 --> 00:30:02,366
We've got a problem!

262
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:05,723
ICU, now!

263
00:30:16,727 --> 00:30:18,558
- Push, push, push!
- Come on!

264
00:30:18,967 --> 00:30:21,003
- There we go!
- Good, Barbara!

265
00:30:21,127 --> 00:30:22,606
And there we go.

266
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,518
Beauty! Looking great, sweetie.

267
00:30:24,607 --> 00:30:25,960
Good job.

268
00:30:26,127 --> 00:30:27,606
Iùs a girl, honey.

269
00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:30,082
She's fine.

270
00:30:32,807 --> 00:30:37,278
- There we are. Clamp this.
- Look, here's your baby.

271
00:30:44,887 --> 00:30:46,115
He's beautiful.

272
00:30:59,407 --> 00:31:00,726
Ben.

273
00:31:06,007 --> 00:31:08,760
Come on, just breathe once. Oxygen.

274
00:31:08,847 --> 00:31:11,839
- Watch the BP.
- Just relax. You're hyperventilating.

275
00:31:13,007 --> 00:31:16,238
Push. Doctor, get your ass over here
and help me!

276
00:31:17,727 --> 00:31:19,558
Bear down on her! Push!

277
00:31:20,327 --> 00:31:24,036
All right, here we go!
Come on, push! Give me one big push!

278
00:31:24,647 --> 00:31:27,161
Come on, here we go! Come on!

279
00:31:30,087 --> 00:31:32,078
I'm sorry. Iùs stillborn.

280
00:31:37,567 --> 00:31:39,125
Get some fluid in her.

281
00:32:14,487 --> 00:32:16,682
How we doing? Everything all right?

282
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:18,485
We lost the Roberts' baby.

283
00:32:19,727 --> 00:32:22,878
- God. How?
- Respiratory failure.

284
00:32:23,607 --> 00:32:25,359
Umbilical asphyxia.

285
00:32:50,647 --> 00:32:54,560
Where did you take the baby?
I saw you take Melanie's baby outside.

286
00:32:54,767 --> 00:32:58,680
I took the baby for an autopsy.
I didn't want the other mothers to see.

287
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:31,399
I baptize thee...

288
00:33:31,847 --> 00:33:33,883
...in the name of the Father...

289
00:33:34,087 --> 00:33:38,478
...and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

290
00:33:41,807 --> 00:33:43,160
I got you.

291
00:33:45,047 --> 00:33:46,241
Yes.

292
00:33:50,407 --> 00:33:51,601
Let us pray.

293
00:33:52,567 --> 00:33:57,516
Heavenly Father, we thank you
that by the water of the Holy Spirit...

294
00:33:57,607 --> 00:34:00,917
...you have bestowed upon
your servants, the forgiveness of sin...

295
00:34:01,007 --> 00:34:03,521
...and have raised them
to the new life of grace.

296
00:34:03,607 --> 00:34:06,360
"Sustain them, O Lord, in your Holy Spirit.

297
00:34:06,487 --> 00:34:09,081
"Give them an inquiring
and discerning heart...

298
00:34:09,367 --> 00:34:11,961
"...the courage to will and to persevere...

299
00:34:12,127 --> 00:34:14,595
"...the spirit to know and to love you...

300
00:34:14,687 --> 00:34:18,202
"...and the gift of wonder and joy
in all your work. Amen."

301
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:19,682
Amen.

302
00:34:36,287 --> 00:34:37,561
Good girl.

303
00:34:38,287 --> 00:34:39,800
Thaùs a good girl.

304
00:34:41,487 --> 00:34:45,275
Note how the section of hair is flat
on one side then arced on the other...

305
00:34:45,367 --> 00:34:47,323
...like a capital "D."
- Right.

306
00:34:48,607 --> 00:34:51,804
The texture is...
I don't know. Iùs unusually soft.

307
00:34:54,367 --> 00:34:56,881
What did you think
when you looked at her nails?

308
00:34:56,967 --> 00:34:58,878
Narrower than normal.

309
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:02,037
Any results yet from the DNA testing?

310
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:04,278
Common genetic characteristics.

311
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:07,359
Almost as if they are siblings
from the same parent.

312
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:12,085
Iùs way too early
to have anything conclusive.

313
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,641
Baby.

314
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:18,999
What are you doing?

315
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:35,123
You can spell your name.

316
00:35:38,647 --> 00:35:40,478
How can you spell your name?

317
00:35:43,647 --> 00:35:45,478
How can Mommy's...

318
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:48,601
...smart little boy spell his name?

319
00:35:59,927 --> 00:36:01,918
Sweetie, was the soup too hot?

320
00:36:14,727 --> 00:36:16,285
Okay, baby.

321
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:19,205
We're going to go see our friend Mara.

322
00:37:08,047 --> 00:37:09,799
Barbara?

323
00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:26,800
Are you crazy?

324
00:37:38,087 --> 00:37:40,476
Honey, can't you tell me what happened?

325
00:39:30,807 --> 00:39:32,035
Don't!

326
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:34,556
No! God, no!

327
00:39:44,207 --> 00:39:46,846
<i>I understand there are</i>
<i>recent developments at Midwich.</i>

328
00:39:48,047 --> 00:39:49,366
Yes.

329
00:39:49,807 --> 00:39:53,163
The children are beginning to interact
more with the general community.

330
00:39:53,407 --> 00:39:54,999
There have been casualties...

331
00:39:55,087 --> 00:39:57,157
I should say accidents, suicides...

332
00:39:57,247 --> 00:39:59,841
...that might be related to
contact with the children.

333
00:39:59,927 --> 00:40:02,236
But no direct physical
violence was involved.

334
00:40:02,847 --> 00:40:06,726
I have also been trying unsuccessfully
to get Dr. Chaffee back on the program.

335
00:40:07,207 --> 00:40:09,198
His daughter's the leader, isn't she?

336
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:11,198
He's probably got his hands full.

337
00:40:11,407 --> 00:40:13,875
Personal considerations aren't important,
are they?

338
00:40:15,007 --> 00:40:18,716
I think that the opportunity to study
these children should take precedent...

339
00:40:18,807 --> 00:40:20,638
...over any considerations.

340
00:40:22,367 --> 00:40:24,198
Leùs cut to the chase here.

341
00:40:24,287 --> 00:40:27,199
Iùs now of interest
to national security that we continue...

342
00:40:27,287 --> 00:40:30,040
...to carefully monitor
their developing powers.

343
00:40:33,087 --> 00:40:35,043
I ask for another year's grant.

344
00:41:46,327 --> 00:41:48,204
Good afternoon, children.

345
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,280
Why do you smile?

346
00:41:54,607 --> 00:41:57,405
You're trying to hide
your thoughts from us.

347
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:01,078
Just how deeply do you see?

348
00:42:01,167 --> 00:42:03,806
Everything active in your mind.

349
00:42:04,087 --> 00:42:07,966
But the process that leads
to the spoken words eludes us.

350
00:42:08,407 --> 00:42:12,320
Why do you speak some thoughts
and not others?

351
00:42:13,687 --> 00:42:16,724
Wouldn't it be a noisy world
if we said everything we thought?

352
00:42:28,207 --> 00:42:29,879
Okay, I'm going to put a drop of this
in your eyes; it won't hurt.

353
00:43:07,047 --> 00:43:08,765
I'm sorry. Calm down!

354
00:43:08,847 --> 00:43:10,883
I'm going to wash your eye out!

355
00:43:11,607 --> 00:43:14,644
Okay, open your eyes! Iùs all right!

356
00:43:16,247 --> 00:43:17,999
Iùs okay!

357
00:44:26,527 --> 00:44:28,358
How's the doctor?

358
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,125
Corneal scarring.

359
00:44:31,487 --> 00:44:33,318
Most likely permanent blindness.

360
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,125
How did it happen?

361
00:44:35,247 --> 00:44:37,078
Doesn't remember much.

362
00:44:37,367 --> 00:44:39,676
It will be listed as an accident.

363
00:44:41,687 --> 00:44:43,359
It was the children.

364
00:44:43,967 --> 00:44:45,446
There's no proof of that.

365
00:44:47,007 --> 00:44:48,679
What I want to know is...

366
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:51,076
...are the people in this town safe?

367
00:44:52,767 --> 00:44:55,406
- What are they going to do to us?
- <i>Alan.</i>

368
00:44:56,207 --> 00:44:58,277
- Hi.
- This has got to stop.

369
00:44:58,367 --> 00:45:00,756
They don't belong in regular classes.

370
00:45:00,967 --> 00:45:03,800
Iùs getting dangerous,
the other children can't learn.

371
00:45:04,567 --> 00:45:06,683
I was thinking
maybe you could teach them.

372
00:45:06,967 --> 00:45:09,083
They seem to respect you.

373
00:45:09,367 --> 00:45:10,322
Respect?

374
00:45:10,727 --> 00:45:13,366
No. They don't even know
the meaning of that word.

375
00:45:13,447 --> 00:45:16,519
Why bother? It doesn't make
any difference what we do.

376
00:45:19,047 --> 00:45:20,924
We need you.

377
00:45:21,847 --> 00:45:23,405
What am I going to teach them?

378
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:26,285
What am I possibly going to teach them?

379
00:45:27,407 --> 00:45:28,806
Humanity.

380
00:45:34,247 --> 00:45:36,124
Humanity.

381
00:45:45,247 --> 00:45:47,636
Hello, sweetheart.

382
00:45:58,647 --> 00:46:00,478
Come on.

383
00:46:27,967 --> 00:46:31,039
There's no need for you
to become emotional.

384
00:46:31,687 --> 00:46:34,724
I'm old enough to do things by myself.

385
00:46:51,247 --> 00:46:54,205
Do you want to talk about what
happened at the clinic today?

386
00:46:54,527 --> 00:46:58,486
Why should I be experiencing emotion
at this moment?

387
00:47:00,967 --> 00:47:03,162
What is that word you're thinking?

388
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:06,201
What is "empathy"?

389
00:47:10,487 --> 00:47:13,797
So if I have felt pain...

390
00:47:13,967 --> 00:47:18,279
...I should be able to identify with others
who feel pain.

391
00:47:21,167 --> 00:47:22,646
Yes.

392
00:47:33,647 --> 00:47:35,285
Good night.

393
00:48:42,767 --> 00:48:44,166
Whaùs the matter?

394
00:48:48,007 --> 00:48:49,520
You want some?

395
00:48:52,087 --> 00:48:53,918
I'm sorry.

396
00:48:55,887 --> 00:48:57,798
I just can't hack it.

397
00:49:38,807 --> 00:49:39,762
<i>"God said...</i>

398
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:43,724
<i>"...Let us make man in our image...</i>

399
00:49:44,687 --> 00:49:46,678
<i>"...after our likeness."</i>

400
00:49:47,847 --> 00:49:50,805
<i>But "image" does not mean outer image...</i>

401
00:49:50,967 --> 00:49:55,245
<i>... or every statue</i>
<i>or photograph would be man.</i>

402
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:59,080
<i>It means the inner image.</i>

403
00:50:00,007 --> 00:50:02,885
<i>The spirit, the soul.</i>

404
00:50:05,687 --> 00:50:07,564
So we gather here today...

405
00:50:08,087 --> 00:50:10,237
...to remember the inner beauty...

406
00:50:11,047 --> 00:50:13,242
...of one who lost her hold.

407
00:50:13,327 --> 00:50:14,885
Melanie Roberts...

408
00:50:15,367 --> 00:50:19,076
...somehow lost that image of herself
as a creature...

409
00:50:19,567 --> 00:50:22,877
...made in GoÔs bountiful spirit.

410
00:50:24,207 --> 00:50:26,437
But what of those in our midst...

411
00:50:27,487 --> 00:50:30,399
...who do not have individual souls...

412
00:50:31,327 --> 00:50:33,204
...or spirits?

413
00:50:33,647 --> 00:50:36,002
They have one mind...

414
00:50:36,287 --> 00:50:38,676
...that they share between them.

415
00:50:38,887 --> 00:50:40,923
One spirit.

416
00:50:42,367 --> 00:50:44,597
And they have the look of man.

417
00:50:46,007 --> 00:50:48,441
But not the nature of mankind.

418
00:50:54,207 --> 00:50:56,084
What are you doing here?

419
00:50:57,047 --> 00:50:58,799
Looking for the baby.

420
00:51:02,687 --> 00:51:05,076
The one who was born with us.

421
00:51:05,327 --> 00:51:07,477
The one who died.

422
00:51:09,287 --> 00:51:11,198
How do you know about that?

423
00:51:13,647 --> 00:51:15,285
The baby's not here.

424
00:51:15,607 --> 00:51:17,245
She was taken away.

425
00:51:17,327 --> 00:51:18,680
Where?

426
00:51:19,247 --> 00:51:20,680
I don't know.

427
00:51:25,327 --> 00:51:28,046
Do you have a memory of the baby?

428
00:51:31,287 --> 00:51:33,198
But it bothers you.

429
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:38,003
It hurts to lose a loved one.

430
00:51:39,327 --> 00:51:41,602
She was to be with me.

431
00:51:43,727 --> 00:51:45,524
We were to be together.

432
00:51:48,047 --> 00:51:50,356
How do you know that?

433
00:52:06,487 --> 00:52:08,557
You've lost someone too.

434
00:52:52,967 --> 00:52:54,685
<i>I think I can teach them.</i>

435
00:52:55,607 --> 00:52:57,359
<i>Anyway, I'll try.</i>

436
00:52:58,447 --> 00:53:01,086
I never told David about the Roberts' baby.

437
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:05,036
Right.

438
00:53:05,527 --> 00:53:08,599
And then he said,
"she was to be with me"?

439
00:53:09,047 --> 00:53:10,765
What did that mean?

440
00:53:11,487 --> 00:53:12,840
I don't know.

441
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,318
Are they paired up...

442
00:53:21,607 --> 00:53:23,245
...like a mate?

443
00:53:46,087 --> 00:53:49,443
What can I teach
such bright young students?

444
00:53:51,287 --> 00:53:52,766
What about human physiology?

445
00:53:52,847 --> 00:53:55,884
Thaùs at least something
I know a little bit about.

446
00:53:56,167 --> 00:53:58,840
For example, does anybody here know
how the eye works?

447
00:53:58,927 --> 00:54:01,487
Do you mean how do we see, or...

448
00:54:01,567 --> 00:54:03,205
Well, what else can the eye do?

449
00:54:03,687 --> 00:54:07,362
- The eyes are...
- The eyes are the windows of the soul.

450
00:54:07,887 --> 00:54:08,922
Yes.

451
00:54:09,167 --> 00:54:12,159
Thaùs right.
I see that you've been reading proverbs.

452
00:54:12,247 --> 00:54:13,726
I was speaking to Robert.

453
00:54:15,327 --> 00:54:18,842
The eyes are the windows of the soul.

454
00:54:27,087 --> 00:54:30,841
All right, if you'd rather
talk about philosophy instead of...

455
00:54:31,247 --> 00:54:34,637
...physiology, leùs talk about the soul.
- <i>Alan.</i>

456
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:35,962
<i>Sorry.</i>

457
00:54:36,047 --> 00:54:38,720
<i>Can you come to my office</i>
<i>for a minute, please?</i>

458
00:54:39,527 --> 00:54:41,722
Yes. I'll be right there.

459
00:54:42,447 --> 00:54:46,360
While I'm away, why don't you each take
out a volume of the encyclopedia...

460
00:54:55,447 --> 00:54:58,439
...and try to learn a little
something about our culture.

461
00:55:17,767 --> 00:55:19,405
I know your game.

462
00:55:20,327 --> 00:55:22,443
I know what you're up to.

463
00:55:22,567 --> 00:55:24,956
Ever since you got here,
I've been watching.

464
00:55:25,727 --> 00:55:28,525
Watching people leave this town.

465
00:55:28,727 --> 00:55:31,195
Watching things die.

466
00:55:31,447 --> 00:55:34,245
You aren't right. None of you.

467
00:55:34,367 --> 00:55:37,882
And one of these days, somebody's
going to do something about it.

468
00:55:40,607 --> 00:55:43,360
I don't like the way
you're looking at me, boy.

469
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:51,004
I got a gun, too, and I'm not the only one.

470
00:55:51,327 --> 00:55:55,286
One day somebody's going to get up
on a rooftop...

471
00:55:55,407 --> 00:55:58,604
...and start picking you little bastards off.

472
00:55:58,847 --> 00:56:02,157
One by one by one.

473
00:56:15,367 --> 00:56:17,085
Aren't you going to do something?

474
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:20,443
Aren't you going to bawl
like all the other little pissants?

475
00:56:21,367 --> 00:56:23,801
Well, do something, damn it!

476
00:58:19,447 --> 00:58:21,677
There are going to be changes.

477
00:58:34,487 --> 00:58:36,125
God help us.

478
00:58:36,607 --> 00:58:37,960
The children did it.

479
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:39,844
I know they did it.

480
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:41,964
And my daughter was involved.

481
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:44,604
Now, who are they?

482
00:58:45,127 --> 00:58:47,482
I first thought they were
a form of mutation.

483
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:49,762
Some abrupt evolutionary jump.

484
00:58:50,767 --> 00:58:52,723
It was their communal consciousness...

485
00:58:53,047 --> 00:58:55,117
...but I couldn't explain the blackout.

486
00:58:55,847 --> 00:58:57,838
Or the mass pregnancies.

487
00:58:58,847 --> 00:59:01,520
Midwich isn't the only colony
of such children.

488
00:59:03,927 --> 00:59:07,556
In a township in northern Australia,
30 infants were born in a single day.

489
00:59:08,807 --> 00:59:10,798
They all died within ten hours of birth.

490
00:59:11,167 --> 00:59:14,682
In an Inuit community near Anchorage,
a group of 10 children were born.

491
00:59:15,367 --> 00:59:19,360
There were 20 births in a small village
near the Turkish-Iranian border.

492
00:59:20,167 --> 00:59:22,283
Each location was remote...

493
00:59:22,567 --> 00:59:25,877
...isolated, and each had a blackout
the same as Midwich.

494
00:59:26,047 --> 00:59:28,163
And how long have you known about this?

495
00:59:28,247 --> 00:59:30,602
The way I see it,
there are three possibilities.

496
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:32,803
Number one: Parthenogenesis.

497
00:59:32,967 --> 00:59:35,720
The development of a fetus
without fertilization.

498
00:59:36,047 --> 00:59:37,765
I know. I don't buy that, either.

499
00:59:37,847 --> 00:59:42,557
Two: We do know the CIA slipped doses
of LSD to men without them knowing it...

500
00:59:42,847 --> 00:59:46,078
...in order to study the effects
of psychotropes on gene structure.

501
00:59:46,167 --> 00:59:48,442
Maybe the government
engineered the blackout...

502
00:59:48,527 --> 00:59:51,439
...then artificially inseminated
your women with super sperm.

503
00:59:51,527 --> 00:59:54,246
First they knocked them out,
then they knocked them up.

504
00:59:56,767 --> 00:59:59,122
And whaùs the third possibility?

505
00:59:59,447 --> 01:00:02,200
Xenogenesis. Implantation.

506
01:00:02,527 --> 01:00:05,246
The production of an offspring
unlike that of the parent.

507
01:00:06,567 --> 01:00:08,444
Or should I say host?

508
01:00:46,127 --> 01:00:48,322
Come back to the project.

509
01:00:49,647 --> 01:00:53,117
Not just a matter of protecting
your daughter. As you can see, it goes...

510
01:00:53,207 --> 01:00:54,879
...far, far beyond that.

511
01:00:58,687 --> 01:01:00,882
You have to put this
in the back of your mind.

512
01:01:00,967 --> 01:01:02,719
Don't think about it when near them.

513
01:01:02,807 --> 01:01:05,924
- Don't ever let them know that you know.
- Why didn't you tell us?

514
01:01:06,007 --> 01:01:08,885
- I mean, why didn't you warn us?
- Because I couldn't.

515
01:01:09,647 --> 01:01:11,126
Well, I couldn't.

516
01:01:11,407 --> 01:01:13,841
If anybody else knew,
the children would know.

517
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:17,363
Look, I have spent years of my life
building a wall around this.

518
01:01:17,447 --> 01:01:20,405
Hiding it, so they couldn't read
what was in my mind.

519
01:01:20,687 --> 01:01:24,157
But as their powers grow stronger,
they keep looking deeper and deeper.

520
01:01:24,527 --> 01:01:27,121
I need your help. Would you please just...

521
01:01:27,887 --> 01:01:29,878
...come back to the project.

522
01:02:19,367 --> 01:02:21,198
We've made our decision.

523
01:02:21,407 --> 01:02:24,240
Discussion will not change our plans.

524
01:02:27,487 --> 01:02:30,524
We will live in the abandoned barn
outside of town.

525
01:02:31,327 --> 01:02:33,318
You will bring us supplies.

526
01:02:34,207 --> 01:02:36,277
You can't stop us, you know.

527
01:02:36,807 --> 01:02:38,365
Don't try.

528
01:02:44,847 --> 01:02:47,759
You've been discussing us with Dr. Vurner.

529
01:02:48,727 --> 01:02:50,763
What did she tell you?

530
01:02:55,087 --> 01:02:56,839
You are hiding something.

531
01:03:52,447 --> 01:03:54,039
I'm not letting you go.

532
01:03:57,407 --> 01:04:00,240
- You haven't been given an option.
- Have you?

533
01:04:05,047 --> 01:04:08,164
You know, you don't always have to do
everything they tell you.

534
01:04:09,767 --> 01:04:11,439
We are the same.

535
01:04:12,527 --> 01:04:14,006
You're not.

536
01:04:14,087 --> 01:04:16,282
You're David. You're different.

537
01:04:48,047 --> 01:04:50,515
I've come to get Julie. Have you seen her?

538
01:04:54,127 --> 01:04:55,845
Is she at the barn?

539
01:04:58,167 --> 01:04:59,316
Fine.

540
01:05:22,287 --> 01:05:23,959
Are you all right?

541
01:05:24,527 --> 01:05:25,596
I'm sorry.

542
01:05:26,087 --> 01:05:27,725
You're okay, aren't you?

543
01:05:28,047 --> 01:05:30,515
Julie doesn't want to come with you.

544
01:05:30,887 --> 01:05:33,799
Damn it, I don't care what Julie wants.
Her mother's frantic.

545
01:05:34,127 --> 01:05:35,924
I'm bringing her home.

546
01:06:37,607 --> 01:06:40,724
Some kind of big accident, Doc,
out by the barn.

547
01:06:42,367 --> 01:06:44,164
Alan, wait!

548
01:06:45,047 --> 01:06:48,596
I was just told that the other towns
with blackout children were destroyed.

549
01:06:48,687 --> 01:06:52,362
- What? All of them?
- Everyone in them, the adults and children.

550
01:06:52,447 --> 01:06:55,120
They couldn't evacuate
without the children knowing.

551
01:06:55,207 --> 01:06:58,279
- The governments gave no warning.
- God. What about Midwich?

552
01:06:58,367 --> 01:07:00,517
I've been told to pack and get out.

553
01:07:00,607 --> 01:07:04,122
I'm leaving tonight. Do the same.
Get out while you can.

554
01:07:14,807 --> 01:07:16,798
Another man is dead.

555
01:07:21,487 --> 01:07:23,876
Why do you hate us so much, Mara?

556
01:07:24,087 --> 01:07:28,080
It isn't a matter of hate.
It is a biological obligation.

557
01:07:29,607 --> 01:07:32,075
You are thinking
of what happened to the others.

558
01:07:32,327 --> 01:07:34,636
Then our actions shouldn't surprise you.

559
01:07:34,727 --> 01:07:37,525
We have to survive
no matter what the cost.

560
01:07:37,607 --> 01:07:39,279
We are the only ones left now.

561
01:07:39,367 --> 01:07:41,676
I don't see why
we can't reach an understanding.

562
01:07:41,767 --> 01:07:43,439
Why can't we just live together?

563
01:07:43,567 --> 01:07:46,081
If we coexist, we shall dominate you.

564
01:07:46,207 --> 01:07:47,879
That is inevitable.

565
01:07:47,967 --> 01:07:50,276
Eventually you will try to eliminate us.

566
01:07:50,367 --> 01:07:52,722
We are all creatures of the life-force.

567
01:07:52,807 --> 01:07:56,117
Now it has set us at one another
to see who will survive.

568
01:07:57,207 --> 01:08:00,279
- Thaùs a cruel sport.
- Life is cruelty.

569
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:04,679
We all feed on each other,
exploit each other in some way to survive.

570
01:08:06,447 --> 01:08:07,880
I don't agree with you.

571
01:08:08,047 --> 01:08:10,800
I think that adaptation
is the key to survival.

572
01:08:11,047 --> 01:08:14,164
Cooperation and symbiosis...

573
01:08:14,327 --> 01:08:15,919
...and compassion.

574
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:20,562
Why do you think your own survival
depends upon emotion from us?

575
01:08:20,887 --> 01:08:22,366
Should we pity you?

576
01:08:22,567 --> 01:08:25,957
- Empathize with your plight?
- You should feel!

577
01:08:26,247 --> 01:08:28,203
You should feel something!

578
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:31,762
Without feelings, you're nothing.

579
01:08:32,047 --> 01:08:34,766
You're just second-rate mimics
of a higher organism.

580
01:08:35,447 --> 01:08:39,486
Thaùs right, a higher organism. We're
your superiors in our capacity to love.

581
01:08:39,647 --> 01:08:42,320
Without compassion,
you're a doomed species.

582
01:08:42,567 --> 01:08:45,923
Emotion is irrelevant. It is not our nature.

583
01:08:52,447 --> 01:08:54,597
I'm not so sure you're right about that.

584
01:08:54,687 --> 01:08:57,201
Still, you are aware of the other colonies.

585
01:08:57,327 --> 01:09:00,399
So you must be, in some basic sense...

586
01:09:00,567 --> 01:09:02,046
...aware of who...

587
01:09:02,407 --> 01:09:04,284
...what we are.

588
01:09:06,167 --> 01:09:07,361
Yes.

589
01:09:07,807 --> 01:09:09,957
So the question becomes...

590
01:09:10,047 --> 01:09:12,242
...should you be allowed to live?

591
01:09:19,007 --> 01:09:20,918
You're suddenly thinking of an ocean.

592
01:09:25,807 --> 01:09:29,083
You're blocking your thoughts
rather effectively with this image.

593
01:09:32,087 --> 01:09:35,284
We must leave here, spread out, disperse.

594
01:09:35,367 --> 01:09:39,326
Soon we will have reached
a stage where we can form new colonies.

595
01:09:39,447 --> 01:09:42,280
You will arrange a method
of getting us away from here.

596
01:09:43,367 --> 01:09:45,164
What if I refuse you?

597
01:09:45,487 --> 01:09:47,603
You are a prisoner of your values...

598
01:09:47,687 --> 01:09:50,485
...and you won't be able to deceive us.

599
01:09:51,647 --> 01:09:53,000
You know that.

600
01:09:53,447 --> 01:09:54,960
Don't you?

601
01:09:56,447 --> 01:09:57,880
Father?

602
01:10:00,967 --> 01:10:01,956
Yes.

603
01:10:02,687 --> 01:10:04,245
Yes, I know that.

604
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:05,925
Make your arrangements.

605
01:10:06,087 --> 01:10:08,442
We must leave tonight.

606
01:10:34,007 --> 01:10:36,396
You're thinking of the one who died.

607
01:10:37,367 --> 01:10:39,358
She was to be my partner.

608
01:10:41,447 --> 01:10:43,438
Yes, iùs true.

609
01:10:44,167 --> 01:10:46,965
Without a mate,
you are of less importance to us.

610
01:10:47,527 --> 01:10:50,758
And your development
of emotions is disturbing.

611
01:10:53,727 --> 01:10:56,366
We can't leave you behind.

612
01:10:57,207 --> 01:10:59,596
It is time we resolved this.

613
01:11:38,567 --> 01:11:40,205
Hurry up!

614
01:11:40,607 --> 01:11:44,395
"Begone, everyone who is proud,
and bring him low...

615
01:11:44,567 --> 01:11:47,161
"...and tread down the wicked
where they stand!"

616
01:11:47,327 --> 01:11:49,887
- This is the last of it.
- All right, get going.

617
01:11:50,167 --> 01:11:52,920
"Bind their faces in the world below.

618
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:55,396
"Then will I also acknowledge to you...

619
01:11:55,487 --> 01:11:59,480
"...that your own right hand
can give you victory!"

620
01:12:12,687 --> 01:12:14,518
I'm glad you're here.

621
01:12:15,087 --> 01:12:18,079
I wanted to talk to you.
I really think that I can help you.

622
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:44,167
You've got to stop! Please stop!

623
01:12:44,247 --> 01:12:46,442
You got to stop! Sarah, please!

624
01:13:17,367 --> 01:13:19,562
"Hast thou eyes of flesh?

625
01:13:20,527 --> 01:13:23,325
"Dost thou see as man sees?"

626
01:15:52,207 --> 01:15:54,801
<i>A state of emergency has been declared.</i>

627
01:15:54,887 --> 01:15:56,843
<i>Please return to your homes...</i>

628
01:15:56,927 --> 01:16:00,078
<i>... and remain there until further notice.</i>

629
01:16:05,207 --> 01:16:08,279
- Come here! Grab my hand, quick!
- Come on!

630
01:16:10,327 --> 01:16:13,285
<i>People will be arrested.</i>

631
01:16:15,967 --> 01:16:18,356
<i>This is a state of emergency.</i>

632
01:16:53,207 --> 01:16:54,162
Please be home.

633
01:16:59,527 --> 01:17:01,324
The children murdered Sarah.

634
01:17:01,447 --> 01:17:04,803
Susan too. I just found her at the clinic.

635
01:17:04,887 --> 01:17:06,878
The police are on their way to the barn.

636
01:17:07,007 --> 01:17:09,885
They're going after the children.
We've got to stop them.

637
01:17:10,247 --> 01:17:12,841
- You can't go. You'll get hurt.
- We've got to try!

638
01:17:12,927 --> 01:17:16,886
No. The state police can't do anything
to stop the children. Iùll be a bloodbath.

639
01:17:17,727 --> 01:17:19,922
Now, listen to me. Listen to me.

640
01:17:20,167 --> 01:17:21,759
There's another way.

641
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:23,878
Now, look, something happened today.

642
01:17:23,967 --> 01:17:26,686
I was able to block Mara
from reading my thoughts.

643
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:29,804
- How?
- I suddenly thought of the ocean.

644
01:17:30,247 --> 01:17:32,841
I suddenly saw the view
in front of our house.

645
01:17:32,927 --> 01:17:36,078
You know how Barbara and I
used to dream our dreams there?

646
01:17:36,167 --> 01:17:38,078
We used to stand on the cliff and...

647
01:17:38,167 --> 01:17:41,955
...right in front of us was something
so much more powerful than we'll ever be.

648
01:17:42,047 --> 01:17:46,006
That image came to me. That image came
to me, and they couldn't see past it.

649
01:17:46,087 --> 01:17:48,885
I know I can do that again.
I can build a wall.

650
01:17:49,407 --> 01:17:51,875
I can build a wall and deceive them.

651
01:17:58,407 --> 01:18:00,238
What are you going to do?

652
01:18:02,287 --> 01:18:04,562
The only thing that we can do.

653
01:18:11,927 --> 01:18:13,042
No.

654
01:18:13,767 --> 01:18:15,246
Not David!

655
01:18:15,607 --> 01:18:18,758
He's not one of them! No!

656
01:18:55,767 --> 01:18:57,758
<i>Multiple suspects. Possible 417.</i>

657
01:18:57,847 --> 01:19:00,680
<i>All units respond and echo your 10-4.</i>

658
01:19:01,287 --> 01:19:02,640
<i>41-A.</i>

659
01:19:04,127 --> 01:19:05,958
<i>41-A, do you copy?</i>

660
01:19:07,607 --> 01:19:09,438
<i>Echo, 41-A. Do you copy?</i>

661
01:19:09,807 --> 01:19:11,718
We're in position. Send them in.

662
01:19:11,967 --> 01:19:15,039
<i>Roger, this is 2-A. I copy.</i>
<i>241 in progress. Stand by.</i>

663
01:19:32,847 --> 01:19:34,485
What are you waiting for?

664
01:19:34,607 --> 01:19:36,359
You got your orders.

665
01:20:09,207 --> 01:20:10,037
Get out!

666
01:22:58,127 --> 01:23:00,846
- More death.
- Survival.

667
01:23:09,007 --> 01:23:11,760
Tell us what arrangements
you have made for us.

668
01:23:12,447 --> 01:23:14,358
Well, I haven't had much time.

669
01:23:16,927 --> 01:23:18,963
It is 11:22.

670
01:23:19,527 --> 01:23:21,802
What are you anxious about?

671
01:23:23,527 --> 01:23:25,358
The arrangements.

672
01:23:26,207 --> 01:23:28,163
Yes. Actually, I...

673
01:23:28,527 --> 01:23:30,358
I left my notebook out in the car.

674
01:23:30,647 --> 01:23:32,638
I wonder if somebody could go out and...

675
01:23:32,727 --> 01:23:35,799
...get my notebook
from the front seat of my car.

676
01:23:39,327 --> 01:23:40,362
No.

677
01:23:51,127 --> 01:23:53,322
I am unable to see what you're thinking.

678
01:23:54,207 --> 01:23:55,765
Well, I'm...

679
01:23:55,887 --> 01:23:59,323
...just wondering who's going to go out
and get the notebook from my car.

680
01:23:59,567 --> 01:24:01,080
- David.
- No.

681
01:24:21,567 --> 01:24:24,081
You are successfully
blocking your thoughts.

682
01:24:51,647 --> 01:24:52,875
You are thinking...

683
01:24:53,927 --> 01:24:55,485
...of a brick wall.

684
01:25:03,287 --> 01:25:05,278
Why do you keep looking at the clock?

685
01:25:18,087 --> 01:25:19,281
Come on.

686
01:25:19,927 --> 01:25:22,122
- We're going now.
- Mother, no.

687
01:25:35,247 --> 01:25:36,839
Take your place.

688
01:26:20,527 --> 01:26:22,677
Stop it! Leave her alone!

689
01:26:23,367 --> 01:26:24,595
Take him!

690
01:26:24,807 --> 01:26:26,479
Go now! Go!

691
01:28:16,767 --> 01:28:18,120
Don't worry.

692
01:28:19,687 --> 01:28:22,759
We'll go someplace where
nobody knows who we are.

693
