2
00:02:09,532 --> 00:02:11,615
- You two looks amazing!
- Like a perfect couple.

3
00:02:12,761 --> 00:02:15,380
C'mon you guys! This is
the wedding day. Smile!

4
00:02:17,945 --> 00:02:19,438
This is not working.

5
00:02:21,654 --> 00:02:25,813
Mr. Pig! Mr. Piggy! C'mon!
Everyone likes Mr. Piggy.

6
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,735
Up here!

7
00:02:27,862 --> 00:02:33,941
What are you doing, Tony?
They have to kiss passionately.

8
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:37,317
Out of the picture, Tony.

9
00:02:37,446 --> 00:02:39,566
And start.

10
00:02:39,696 --> 00:02:44,981
How long have they been dating?
After all, it must be informed by seven.

11
00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:49,521
I'm trying to figure out how long
should mingle before the wedding.

12
00:02:49,654 --> 00:02:51,858
Right.

13
00:02:51,987 --> 00:02:54,025
Give it here.

14
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:59,692
Please help a little bit, guys.
Sit down properly.

15
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:05,561
Tonya.

16
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:09,692
What are you doing? Sorry.

17
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:11,693
Stop Dancing.

18
00:03:11,821 --> 00:03:16,194
♫ Singing... ♫

19
00:03:27,404 --> 00:03:30,438
I like the espresso very much.

20
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:35,776
It is a strong and enjoyable hair.

21
00:03:36,863 --> 00:03:41,603
I see that you, Agent Ross
you consider the usual coffee...

22
00:03:41,738 --> 00:03:47,153
keep but Meyers
latte and a lot more of the sweet.

23
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:50,526
For this reason, I became a
citizen of the United States.

24
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:54,399
America is an alternative country.

25
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,362
The Croatian coffee tastes like
dog..

26
00:03:57,488 --> 00:04:01,233
Why exactly did you want to
meet with us, Mr. Nikitin?

27
00:04:01,363 --> 00:04:03,304
You and your wife already
have foreign citizenship.

28
00:04:03,465 --> 00:04:05,782
I don't know anything we can help you with

29
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,568
I want my daughter Masha to receive
the same without downtime.

30
00:04:10,696 --> 00:04:16,314
What do you suggest?
Liver like that.

31
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:23,234
I understand that this service
usually costs $ 10,000.

32
00:04:26,113 --> 00:04:31,351
Whatever your opinion
it is to overtake the immigration laws...

33
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:35,612
we usually do not have to speed up the
any civil applications.

34
00:04:35,738 --> 00:04:41,319
We could even arrest you.
We keep an eye on your daughter.

35
00:04:46,113 --> 00:04:52,193
You said that they could buy. Rumor has it that.
I'm looking for someone else.

36
00:04:52,322 --> 00:04:57,442
My daughter is now regarded as an eye.
We have to find another way.

37
00:05:08,447 --> 00:05:14,314
The sooner this is done, the sooner you
looting.

38
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:18,441
It will only pick on you.
Give me a kiss.

39
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:23,902
PLEASE.
Rapsuta between the hind legs, and poses...

40
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,154
Between the rear legs?
Tickle is normal.

41
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,356
I'm not a tickler type..
You have your dog, you can tickle.

42
00:05:32,489 --> 00:05:36,317
Advertisement promised satisfaction.
By the way I do not pay.

43
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,396
Right.

44
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,192
I can I tickle your dog.
Generally make the first dinner.

45
00:05:46,322 --> 00:05:48,858
That's it.

46
00:05:50,697 --> 00:05:52,688
I'm sorry I'm late.

47
00:05:54,156 --> 00:05:59,690
Hierotko dog's bundle of joy?
By the way, it does not cooperate.

48
00:05:59,822 --> 00:06:04,775
That's the next customer.
Show costumes, but do not bring in here.

49
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,987
Understood.

50
00:06:09,864 --> 00:06:11,522
Hjei.

51
00:06:11,656 --> 00:06:17,155
Tjoin kjissan kjuvattavaksi.

52
00:06:17,281 --> 00:06:21,061
I like the accents.
It seems to be a Venezuelan?

53
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:26,652
All right! It should be rerub.

54
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:30,691
It growled all the time.
Like a pirate. Meilaan images.

55
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:35,563
Ballerina or an angel?
I said that the cat may be imported!

56
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,189
Kjissi!

57
00:06:42,573 --> 00:06:44,149
Brutus.

58
00:06:44,281 --> 00:06:47,196
Here, Brutus.

59
00:06:57,614 --> 00:07:01,987
- Stop, kjissimirri!
- Brutus!

60
00:07:09,114 --> 00:07:11,271
Staff only

61
00:07:22,656 --> 00:07:27,065
I have to go,
I am late model or part thereof.

62
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:32,318
I'm sorry the whole hassle.
It's okay, accidents do happen.

63
00:07:37,781 --> 00:07:43,979
Why are not you already asked me out?
I have been assistant month.

64
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:49,314
Oh, and you've been...

65
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:53,821
Very creative relationship squeaky toys.
You are talented.

66
00:07:53,948 --> 00:07:56,615
I not feel attractive?

67
00:07:57,698 --> 00:08:02,071
You are, but not a good idea...
I feel

68
00:08:03,157 --> 00:08:06,937
that is a strong connection between us.

69
00:08:08,032 --> 00:08:13,945
If I moved to you,
I never miss his work.

70
00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:18,149
However, the alarm clock function.

71
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:25,447
Think about it.

72
00:08:27,698 --> 00:08:28,978
Right.

73
00:08:40,532 --> 00:08:42,274
<i>Display language.</i>

74
00:08:43,907 --> 00:08:46,940
You suffer from stress.
You have no idea.

75
00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:50,818
Chi is not in balance. All it takes is
.

76
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:55,438
This is my first time.
Does it hurt?

77
00:08:55,574 --> 00:09:00,196
No pain. Close your eyes. Relax.

78
00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:10,779
Do not seem too bad.

79
00:09:19,532 --> 00:09:22,862
You look stressed out.
Do you need help?

80
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:32,697
Do you like borscht?
Family Recipe.

81
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:41,400
I am Vlatko Nikitin.
Brick Land and Oleg are alaisiani.

82
00:09:41,532 --> 00:09:43,404
Call me Brickiksi.

83
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:46,863
What do you want? This is an interception.

84
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:51,399
After all. You came here
voluntarily to indemnify.

85
00:09:51,532 --> 00:09:56,486
Compensate? I did not do anything.
Tell me it is my wife's cat.

86
00:09:56,616 --> 00:09:59,649
I'm sorry. The new assistant...

87
00:09:59,782 --> 00:10:06,941
Cat is worthless. Dubrovnik
at a cost of 3 kuna. So, 54 cents.

88
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:11,613
Auricular veterinary fees.
It's just a cat.

89
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:17,026
I prefer the goats. But my wife
Boris The stage is sad.

90
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:22,988
You should be aware, Mr. Nik... Nicotine.
How can I compensate for this?

91
00:10:23,116 --> 00:10:29,480
The easiest way is to let boys treat
cement shoes and a swimming trip.

92
00:10:33,908 --> 00:10:35,945
Aha! Oh...

93
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:41,820
What is the second easiest?
Marry my daughter, Masha.

94
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:49,149
I'm sorry?
Mashalla a visa problem.

95
00:10:49,283 --> 00:10:52,400
Should we get married,
in order to receive a residence permit?

96
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:57,320
Year after the federal repeal of
, and our accounts are clear.

97
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:02,687
I have not even met him.
It's just a sham marriage.

98
00:11:02,825 --> 00:11:07,316
Masha women after Bricklandin.
Brick Land is like my own son...

99
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,448
but very jealous.

100
00:11:10,575 --> 00:11:14,615
I would not recommend
any sexual activity...

101
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:18,687
Or he will kill you
very unpleasant way.

102
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:24,692
I'm sorry, but the debate is over.
I am sorry for the cat, but...

103
00:11:25,617 --> 00:11:28,105
You do not know who I am.

104
00:11:28,242 --> 00:11:31,856
Many influential men have
been trying to deceive me.

105
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:34,943
And where are they now?
Who knows?

106
00:11:35,075 --> 00:11:38,108
You're not a man of consequence.

107
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:43,572
You're smart.
Yes You make the right decision.

108
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,404
Let us live forever.

109
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,525
Who the hell is this?

110
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:32,859
I, the mother.
You better be in trouble,

111
00:12:32,992 --> 00:12:37,614
when you call at this time.
I have a mask on the face!

112
00:12:37,742 --> 00:12:41,072
I have to marry a Croatian girl, or I die.

113
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,531
<i>Then go get married.
Did not you hear?</i>

114
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:51,485
This is good news.
Her father would kill me.

115
00:12:51,617 --> 00:12:55,397
Do you love him?
I've never met him.

116
00:12:55,534 --> 00:12:59,859
The story is complex.
The same old hymn every time.

117
00:12:59,992 --> 00:13:04,945
Is he old enough to become a mother?
Eastern Europeans are fertile.

118
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:09,069
This is not helping matters.
How did he look like?

119
00:13:09,201 --> 00:13:12,566
<i>I do not know, but
his mother does not bode well.</i>

120
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:17,109
Of all the ugly, it's just a matter of time
. Is he rich?

121
00:13:17,242 --> 00:13:21,283
His father is a crime boss.
So the money is enough.

122
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:25,865
Are you even listening?
Do you have other women?

123
00:13:25,993 --> 00:13:29,193
I do not have time to wait for
grandchildren!

124
00:13:29,326 --> 00:13:34,659
Forget it, I do not touch him.
Your father is kind of listened to.

125
00:13:34,784 --> 00:13:37,782
You will be conceived for
honeymooners in the elevator.

126
00:13:37,909 --> 00:13:41,903
I had the elevator button after-
on my forehead for two days.

127
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:48,114
That would not have needed to hear.
The men are afraid of commitment.

128
00:13:48,243 --> 00:13:50,233
Marry him, else I will not say.

129
00:13:52,368 --> 00:13:56,029
Do you like the machine?
I got it for half the price.

130
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,319
You made the sleek shops.
Yes, something at least flowed.

131
00:14:01,784 --> 00:14:06,323
The wedding is two weeks from now.
Brick Land wants to be the best man.

132
00:14:07,743 --> 00:14:10,066
Touching.

133
00:14:10,201 --> 00:14:14,740
Give this Mashalle.
It will convince the authorities.

134
00:14:14,868 --> 00:14:18,731
Do you want to call witnesses?
I do not.

135
00:14:18,868 --> 00:14:23,360
I am an only child.
Father is gone and the mother is...

136
00:14:23,493 --> 00:14:25,199
Busy.

137
00:14:25,326 --> 00:14:29,616
Okay, meeting's over. Check-out.

138
00:14:41,701 --> 00:14:45,233
What do you mean you're
going to get married?

139
00:14:45,368 --> 00:14:47,939
I will get married.

140
00:14:48,076 --> 00:14:53,658
How long have you married him?
How long? How long?

141
00:14:55,077 --> 00:14:58,110
We have not yet had sex.

142
00:14:58,243 --> 00:15:01,360
Why? Is he or virgin?

143
00:15:01,493 --> 00:15:06,281
- Is he sexy?
- He is a Croat.

144
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,776
Does she speak English?
Let's hope.

145
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,192
Tilasitko him to Ebay?
I do not.

146
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:18,316
Why then did not identify him?
The situation is complex.

147
00:15:25,202 --> 00:15:28,484
I'm not stupid, Bryan.

148
00:15:28,618 --> 00:15:32,826
If you want to leave, you do not need
to come up with kruusialaista virgins.

149
00:15:32,952 --> 00:15:36,780
Croatian Constitution.
I do not invent him.

150
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:40,323
<i>I have never been.
I  am the deceased!</i>

151
00:15:40,452 --> 00:15:43,023
But we are not even seeing anybody.

152
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,201
You can leave me, if you want.
Why would I do it?

153
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,441
- I love you.
- Look here, Tony.

154
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,658
You think I understand
the relationship abuse.

155
00:15:55,785 --> 00:16:02,398
I do not know many at all this,
but I know the men. You want me to.

156
00:16:02,535 --> 00:16:07,442
, Unfortunately, I do not want to.
I will get married.

157
00:16:08,827 --> 00:16:11,067
After all, it is seen.

158
00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:15,820
What's over there talking about?

159
00:16:15,952 --> 00:16:18,820
Let's go through it one more time.

160
00:16:18,952 --> 00:16:22,199
We met ballet presentation.

161
00:16:22,327 --> 00:16:26,368
It was "Gazelle".
"Giselle" Joffrey Ballet!

162
00:16:26,494 --> 00:16:28,899
Is it to be the ballet?

163
00:16:29,994 --> 00:16:32,613
Masha loves to dance!

164
00:16:32,744 --> 00:16:36,441
Exactly the same. We went to the ballet,
we started to pick out...

165
00:16:36,577 --> 00:16:40,618
Where Kosit him?
Ukraine a comparable bistro.

166
00:16:40,744 --> 00:16:44,192
Ukraine a comparable tavern.
Favorite drink?

167
00:16:44,327 --> 00:16:47,444
I know this . Stav... Do not say that.

168
00:16:47,577 --> 00:16:49,983
<i>Stavlenniy myod.</i>

169
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:53,567
- Favorite color?
- Blue.

170
00:16:53,703 --> 00:16:56,654
Red! It is the final answer.

171
00:16:56,786 --> 00:16:59,570
What he hates the most?

172
00:16:59,703 --> 00:17:02,108
Big British villains.

173
00:17:02,244 --> 00:17:08,075
Game Men! He hates them. Play with
the calculator, it was a bad joke.

174
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:12,825
Listen to me.
You will meet Masha's nightclub.

175
00:17:12,953 --> 00:17:19,316
Present knew well.
Lost but if too far, the crusher you!

176
00:17:19,453 --> 00:17:22,949
Right. Thank you for
your encouragement, sir.

177
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:29,650
Would help the issue, if I
knew what he looks like.

178
00:17:31,911 --> 00:17:35,822
In my eyes he is
the world's most beautiful woman.

179
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:55,444
Hi, I'm Bryan.
Brick told me about you a lot.

180
00:17:56,245 --> 00:18:01,068
Zoya.
Zoya? Do not you not Masha?

181
00:18:01,203 --> 00:18:04,236
- Zoya.
- Awesome!

182
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,490
Masha...

183
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,026
Bryan?

184
00:18:24,953 --> 00:18:27,157
Masha?

185
00:18:29,078 --> 00:18:33,487
Ohjaatko us to the table, Anya?
Okay.

186
00:18:34,453 --> 00:18:36,243
Come on.

187
00:18:46,745 --> 00:18:48,652
Thank you.

188
00:18:52,453 --> 00:18:55,985
That's the embarrassment.
Exactly.

189
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,651
I did not know what you look like.

190
00:18:59,787 --> 00:19:04,279
You seem disappointed.
I'm not. English is perfect.

191
00:19:04,412 --> 00:19:06,900
Nanny was an American.

192
00:19:07,037 --> 00:19:10,485
You look just like I thought.

193
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,199
I went to see your Facebook profile.

194
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:20,657
It was hen. Cowboy Boots
had a friend, and we are not together.

195
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:25,484
You're only here because of the cat.
I am sorry.

196
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:30,858
It's all right. No offense, but
I do not want to get married.

197
00:19:30,995 --> 00:19:34,824
I know that you are a photographer
and your eyes are hazel...

198
00:19:34,954 --> 00:19:37,822
But it's not a good enough reason.

199
00:19:39,829 --> 00:19:43,988
I think it would become a citizen
legally in less than years from now...

200
00:19:44,121 --> 00:19:47,901
but that was before the father tried to
bribe the immigration authorities to.

201
00:19:48,037 --> 00:19:51,699
I told him to stay away
from the matter, but...

202
00:19:54,371 --> 00:19:59,656
There are two men, who
are watching us.

203
00:20:01,871 --> 00:20:05,071
Behave normally.

204
00:20:11,496 --> 00:20:13,403
What do we do now?

205
00:20:13,537 --> 00:20:16,903
Allow them to watch.

206
00:20:28,371 --> 00:20:31,653
I do not, then nothing Barysnikov.

207
00:20:31,788 --> 00:20:35,200
- Just relax.
- Okay.

208
00:20:39,413 --> 00:20:42,909
Oh, all right.

209
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:46,486
No, no.
Is not it good business?

210
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:50,780
- Follow me.
- Okay.

211
00:20:50,913 --> 00:20:54,658
Follow a slow rhythm.

212
00:21:01,663 --> 00:21:05,111
They noticed us? Just be sure.

213
00:21:13,246 --> 00:21:16,493
They are skilled to leave. Who?

214
00:21:16,621 --> 00:21:19,323
The immigration officers.

215
00:21:19,455 --> 00:21:23,780
So, all right.
Better, however, to be sure.

216
00:21:33,246 --> 00:21:36,328
The route is clear, is seen at a wedding.

217
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:52,739
Mr. Lighthouse, we have
Ross Meyers and immigration.

218
00:21:52,872 --> 00:21:56,817
Do you plan to get married
Masha Nikitin with?

219
00:21:56,955 --> 00:21:59,704
Yes I will.

220
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:05,032
We are seeing anybody couple of months.
She hates men in the game.

221
00:22:07,247 --> 00:22:11,406
Where did you meet?
Joffrey Ballet.

222
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:15,402
"The Nutcracker" was in the software.
There when "Gazelle" ie "Giselle".

223
00:22:15,538 --> 00:22:19,995
Three ballet one.
You too So do ballet.

224
00:22:20,122 --> 00:22:27,078
I do not. I got a free ticket and I
thought that maybe I would meet Croatian.

225
00:22:27,205 --> 00:22:29,409
And this was the case.

226
00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:32,702
What is this about?

227
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:38,032
You know, yes. Masha's visa will expire on
and the wedding of the authorization.

228
00:22:38,164 --> 00:22:41,660
Was his father
money to a girl married to?

229
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:47,572
Give us a break... Nikitin is a
crime against the world's bosses.

230
00:22:47,705 --> 00:22:52,612
Alleged extortion and murder.
Do you want her vävykseen?

231
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:58,495
How much did he have to shell out?
No, I swear.

232
00:22:58,622 --> 00:23:04,240
But he will pay an expensive
honeymoon in the South Sea.

233
00:23:05,914 --> 00:23:12,526
Do not you know his honeymoon?
My Nikon? Of course, I know.

234
00:23:12,664 --> 00:23:15,781
I just do not know
that he will pay for everything.

235
00:23:15,914 --> 00:23:19,161
Pila Then to his surprise.

236
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:22,619
End up in prison, while if you are lying.

237
00:23:22,747 --> 00:23:26,279
Or you will die.
He ​​does not let you find out alive.

238
00:23:26,414 --> 00:23:33,288
If you have been forced into, you will get a
immunity from prosecution. So help against.

239
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:38,571
What you long for assistance?
Explain the Nikitin transactions.

240
00:23:38,706 --> 00:23:41,076
Bank accounts, money laundering, all.

241
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:50,193
I'm sorry, but I am not under pressure to
. I love Mashaa.

242
00:23:52,373 --> 00:23:58,487
Right. But think about it.

00:24:01,123 --> 00:24:04,986
Okay,

244
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:13,195

00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:19,445
I'm looking for catnip. Is there?
I do not have catnip.

00:24:19,581 --> 00:24:24,285
You look great... In a way.
But you have to leave.

247

Put me positions and shoot me if you want.

00:24:32,748 --> 00:24:35,995
You have got to go, Tony.

249
00:24:40,081 --> 00:24:45,415
If you care about me, forget me.
I do not give it up easily.

<i>Welcome! I want to raise the cup's

339
00:33:59,503 --> 00:34:03,448
See, it works already.
Enter now.

340
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,084
Right.

341
00:34:11,419 --> 00:34:16,657
<i>Gracias.  A nice honeymoon.
Pedal once for me.</i>

342
00:34:24,461 --> 00:34:27,909
<i>Con su Permiso.</i>

343
00:34:55,795 --> 00:34:58,709
Do not even think about it.

344
00:35:31,962 --> 00:35:34,960
- Hi.
- Hello.

345
00:35:35,087 --> 00:35:39,661
Brick that it is a favorite.
Because it arouses passion?

346
00:35:39,795 --> 00:35:45,164
I like the taste of it. Are you up to?
I'd love to.

347
00:35:45,962 --> 00:35:50,121
I have never had such a beautiful place
.

348
00:35:50,253 --> 00:35:56,286
Honeymoon of your dreams would be a village,
and dance barefoot in the moonlight.

349
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:01,410
I do not see Brick agreeing to.
I will not marry with the Brick.

350
00:36:02,545 --> 00:36:06,325
I'm going to marry the man she loves with.

351
00:36:09,045 --> 00:36:13,749
I like your idea, in fact
honeymooners in the jungle.

352
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:17,410
Do you like?
I like, I wanted a photographer.

353
00:36:17,545 --> 00:36:21,242
National Geographic, and I was going to see the world.
Contrary to what happened.

354
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:24,377
I take pictures of pets
tyhmissä clothes.

355
00:36:24,504 --> 00:36:29,042
After getting citizenship, I open
a dance school. I was lucky.

356
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:34,041
My parents paid tuntini.
I want to give other children the same.

357
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:37,915
It's great, really cutting edge.

358
00:36:38,045 --> 00:36:42,868
A toast for finding happiness.
Happiness.

359
00:36:44,587 --> 00:36:50,168
Good, my passion wakes up.
Not robe because I did not feel.

360
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:57,042
I can not believe was married.
I'm not.

361
00:37:00,212 --> 00:37:04,253
Okay, you get a bed.
I sleep in an armchair.

362
00:37:04,379 --> 00:37:08,586
- Are you sure?
- All yours.

363
00:37:10,504 --> 00:37:14,545
Where you going?
A breath of fresh air.

364
00:37:14,671 --> 00:37:18,083
Day has been a long,
I almost died.

365
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:25,249
Right.
Do not monitor, waiting for the gold.

366
00:37:56,171 --> 00:38:00,959
- Do you take more?
- Absolutely.

367
00:38:01,088 --> 00:38:04,121
Thank you, Al.

368
00:38:04,254 --> 00:38:08,912
Laitetaanko room spike?
Place, 12 bungalow.

369
00:38:09,046 --> 00:38:12,246
Bridal Suite.
Where is your wife?

370
00:38:13,338 --> 00:38:16,336
My wife... He sleeps.

371
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:20,124
It was a long
and he is at the very end.

372
00:38:21,046 --> 00:38:24,791
In fact, I päästäisi man out,
if it is my honeymoon.

373
00:38:24,921 --> 00:38:29,164
Time naughty.
You long to more romance.

374
00:38:29,296 --> 00:38:31,915
You have no idea.

375
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:36,746
Where can he be?

376
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:43,208
Dancing. She is a dancer.
And it sucks, I can not dance.

377
00:38:43,338 --> 00:38:46,834
It is easily reversible.
Where are we headed?

378
00:38:46,963 --> 00:38:50,625
For dance lesson.
It does not seem to be a good idea.

379
00:38:50,755 --> 00:38:55,293
You need to relax.
Show me your best.

380
00:38:55,422 --> 00:38:58,752
The best me your motion?
Exactly.

381
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:05,748
Stop. You gotta be kidding.
I do not, of course.

382
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,921
It's what I thought.
Focus on the music.

383
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:15,711
And move those hips.
These hips are moving.

384
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,085
And the move.

385
00:39:19,213 --> 00:39:23,752
Close your eyes . And imagine that you are
with your wife.

386
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,999
You can smell her perfume.

387
00:39:30,089 --> 00:39:32,755
You will feel the heat of his skin.

388
00:39:34,297 --> 00:39:37,081
I can feel it.

389
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,328
I can feel it. I dance.

390
00:39:43,922 --> 00:39:46,126
It took barley bread.

391
00:39:51,755 --> 00:39:55,666
Masha, come dance with me.
You've got a couple already had.

392
00:39:55,797 --> 00:39:59,494
He just taught me,
so I could surprise you.

393
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:03,790
I'm not a naistennaurattaja.

394
00:40:03,922 --> 00:40:08,461
I know that men hate the game.
Bryan...

395
00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:11,273
You do not know anything.
Do what you want, as

396
00:40:11,274 --> 00:40:13,958
long as you do not
compromise the citizenship.

397
00:40:14,089 --> 00:40:18,545
Hinkkaus honeymoon
waiter at the beginning is a stupid.

398
00:40:18,672 --> 00:40:21,125
You're right.

399
00:40:22,214 --> 00:40:25,414
You're right. Sorry.

400
00:40:27,047 --> 00:40:31,705
You look great in that dress.

401
00:40:33,506 --> 00:40:36,918
This is a case of
that I can get citizenship.

402
00:40:37,047 --> 00:40:42,167
And my father, that you pay your debts.
Not about anything else.

403
00:40:48,214 --> 00:40:51,876
Brick Land!
Stews is not enough and goats.

404
00:40:52,006 --> 00:40:54,541
Mary not to talk to the cook.

405
00:40:55,631 --> 00:41:01,130
Have you heard of the liaison officer?
Because of the storm, all is mute.

406
00:41:01,256 --> 00:41:07,288
I do not trust the photographer.
I'm going to keep an eye on him to himself.

407
00:41:19,798 --> 00:41:22,369
Hi.

408
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,672
- Hi.
- Hello.

409
00:41:35,798 --> 00:41:40,870
I organized you to the broth.
It was my fault.

410
00:41:41,006 --> 00:41:44,253
I know how you can make it up.

411
00:41:44,381 --> 00:41:49,169
Close is a sheltered cove.
It is incredibly romantic.

412
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:53,872
You can swim in the nude, if you wish.
I think we stay in the pool.

413
00:41:54,006 --> 00:41:57,952
He does not seem to want to see...
Here, I drew the map.

414
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:01,953
I swear that it will solve
all your problems.

415
00:42:07,131 --> 00:42:11,705
Hi, Mom.
I am lonely. Being here

416
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:16,378
<i>is just as much fun as hemorrhoids.
Was it worth  to hit the police.</i>

417
00:42:16,507 --> 00:42:20,963
I did not drive too fast,
he deserved it. Please be patient.

418
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:26,790
Dingle plumber. I'm not Walt.
The kitchen sink, the smell of death.

419
00:42:26,923 --> 00:42:30,455
It would not be the first time.

420
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:35,129
Why else would you answer the phone?
You should trample on your wife.

421
00:42:35,965 --> 00:42:40,504
It's just a transaction.
He ​​did not even like me.

422
00:42:40,632 --> 00:42:45,372
I'm not prevented it, I do not have
dad. But the slow lane.

423
00:42:45,507 --> 00:42:48,837
All I say.

424
00:42:48,965 --> 00:42:52,165
And you had nothing more to say.

425
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:06,586
- Hi.
- Hello.

426
00:43:08,674 --> 00:43:13,296
Can you grease my back?
Of course.

427
00:43:18,757 --> 00:43:22,916
Excuse me yesterday.
I ylireagoin.

428
00:43:23,049 --> 00:43:28,832
The day was stressful for both.
Let's forget the whole thing.

429
00:43:28,965 --> 00:43:31,632
Right.

430
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:37,672
I heard a very nice lagoon.

431
00:43:39,341 --> 00:43:43,879
It's beautiful.
We can go for a swim down the...

432
00:43:44,007 --> 00:43:48,215
We can go for a swim.
Or whatever you want.

433
00:43:51,257 --> 00:43:53,746
How did you hear about this?

434
00:43:53,882 --> 00:43:58,504
To be honest it is the waiter drew the map.

435
00:43:58,632 --> 00:44:04,581
He felt guilty about yesterday and told
that should appear here.

436
00:44:04,716 --> 00:44:08,756
Here is a splendid thing.
I have. Wait, hold that position.

437
00:44:09,632 --> 00:44:13,080
Beautiful. Okay...

438
00:44:13,216 --> 00:44:16,581
Yes, Mrs. Lighthouse. Well done...

439
00:44:16,716 --> 00:44:19,500
It looks good.

440
00:44:19,633 --> 00:44:24,171
Smile as I was considering, why are you
sailor outfit. Since you are a cat.

441
00:44:24,299 --> 00:44:29,917
Laughing only, it is a job.
And the owners are the only crazy.

442
00:44:30,049 --> 00:44:33,913
Apart from your mother. He is not stupid.
He ​​is the top.

443
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:38,872
And your father. Do you remember?
"Gorko..." They're not great people.

444
00:44:39,008 --> 00:44:43,167
They are criminals.
But they are my parents.

445
00:44:44,174 --> 00:44:48,168
You are not the only one
which is a family problem.

446
00:44:49,383 --> 00:44:52,416
All they think my dad gone.

447
00:44:53,508 --> 00:44:57,371
But my mother killed her.
Oh, my God.

448
00:44:57,508 --> 00:45:03,042
The mother buried him in the back yard.
The client's two dogs...

449
00:45:04,133 --> 00:45:08,541
digging up his father. They smell the
water from his beard or something.

450
00:45:08,675 --> 00:45:15,205
They ran to the father's bones in his mouth.
It consisted of dog fighting.

451
00:45:15,341 --> 00:45:19,086
You are a terrible liar.
I had to go in therapy.

452
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:22,913
<i>Ran to the father's bones in his mouth...</i>

453
00:45:34,133 --> 00:45:37,581
Here is a really beautiful.
This is the case.

454
00:45:37,716 --> 00:45:41,497
Stay still.
I'll take two, three... it rains.

455
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:47,083
Do you know what.

456
00:45:47,217 --> 00:45:52,288
Now, let's do it. Come in water, Rouvas
. Come on!

457
00:45:57,842 --> 00:46:00,626
That only.

458
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,840
It became clear to the whole thing.

459
00:46:03,967 --> 00:46:06,834
What are you doing?
For more of your earnings.

460
00:46:06,967 --> 00:46:09,834
What are? Now I get it.

461
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,166
Here you go!

462
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:18,590
Yes! A perfect fit!
Flicker. What about now?

463
00:46:18,717 --> 00:46:21,040
Come!

464
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:26,754
Wait. Did you hear that?
I guess it's Brick. What kind of water?

465
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:32,501
Throw shorts here! I'm serious.
If anyone sees me so, I'm...

466
00:46:32,634 --> 00:46:35,881
Take care too much.
It's just an animal.

467
00:46:36,009 --> 00:46:39,339
Throw shorts here. Masha!

468
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:46,254
Masha.

469
00:46:47,842 --> 00:46:51,006
<i>A really fun, Masha.
Where are you?</i>

470
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,049
Masha?

471
00:47:13,051 --> 00:47:17,957
It's fine.
Lahjapuodista. It is Guccia.

472
00:47:19,051 --> 00:47:23,258
You seem to enjoy the honeymoon.
Exactly.

473
00:47:23,384 --> 00:47:27,923
Have you seen my wife?
Pikkolo just let him inside.

474
00:47:32,509 --> 00:47:36,503
A really fun,
that you left me there.

475
00:47:39,301 --> 00:47:43,709
You Tarzan, me Tonya.
How did you get here?

476
00:47:43,843 --> 00:47:47,504
Bonus Points. Do not say now, that
tossing them in vain.

477
00:47:47,634 --> 00:47:52,256
You have to go.
As soon as the clean puskasi.

478
00:47:52,384 --> 00:47:55,169
<i>- Yes?
-  Your mother is here.</i>

479
00:47:55,301 --> 00:47:57,754
Stop. Hi, Mom.

480
00:47:57,884 --> 00:48:00,882
Thank God.
At last you have got started.

481
00:48:01,009 --> 00:48:06,165
I can not talk right now.
Take it easy foreplay.

482
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:10,591
Hungry everything looks good.
Whether it stuck.

483
00:48:12,718 --> 00:48:17,375
All I say.
Can you pass patukkani?

484
00:48:19,009 --> 00:48:22,920
Stop it! I am married.
Tao, it is already on your head.

485
00:48:25,968 --> 00:48:29,499
It is Masha! Masha?
Where are you, Masha?

486
00:48:29,635 --> 00:48:34,339
<i>We want 10 million
six dollars tomorrow.</i>

487
00:48:34,468 --> 00:48:39,007
<i>Kill him, if you contact
police. Tilinumerotekstarilla.</i>

488
00:48:39,135 --> 00:48:44,918
<i>I plot, I do not have the money.
Find someone, else he will die.</i>

489
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,463
Now you should be aware of the waters.

490
00:48:52,593 --> 00:48:55,295
Who are you?

491
00:48:55,426 --> 00:48:59,503
Where do you take me? Shut up.

492
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:11,213
Masha have been kidnapped.
Do not look at me.

493
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:16,456
After all, it seemed to have gone well.
Someone grabbed my wife.

494
00:49:16,593 --> 00:49:21,416
There lagoon. What do you know about it?
I do nothing. And who is he?

495
00:49:21,552 --> 00:49:25,759
His girlfriend. What about you?
You're not my girlfriend!

496
00:49:25,885 --> 00:49:29,049
Calm down and tell me what happened.

497
00:49:32,885 --> 00:49:35,456
What's up?

498
00:49:37,427 --> 00:49:42,001
Your friend was here yesterday and
hinkkasi with the waiter.

499
00:49:42,135 --> 00:49:45,169
Even worse.
He ​​took naisesi jungle.

500
00:49:45,302 --> 00:49:49,342
He returned to his bottom bare
joking, and leaves a blanket.

501
00:49:49,469 --> 00:49:52,751
He's quite a dog.

502
00:49:55,885 --> 00:50:00,875
That's it.
I knew that the union was not authentic.

503
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:06,130
No one mind would not leave me.
He will die, if I call someone.

504
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:10,585
The same they always they repeat, the only.
What is the worst thing that can happen?

505
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:14,547
He can not die!
Do not cry, I'm just trying to help!

506
00:50:14,677 --> 00:50:19,963
How do you get your hands on 10 million?
I do not know. Perhaps apeltani.

507
00:50:20,094 --> 00:50:25,628
Case solved, now room service.
Shut up, Tony!

508
00:50:26,677 --> 00:50:32,176
Masha's father learns that the girl
was abducted in a remote lagoon...

509
00:50:32,302 --> 00:50:36,794
I am being tortured and cut up!
I can not ask money from him.

510
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:41,501
Then there is only one.
You have to save him.

511
00:50:42,802 --> 00:50:47,507
Do I look like from Batman? I take
pictures of dogs dressed as a pirate.

I know the island inside out,
my cousin as well. We will help you.

You have helped me enough already.

514
00:50:54,052 --> 00:50:56,671
Are you accusing me of everything?
Perhaps it should be.

515
00:50:56,802 --> 00:51:00,843
I just want to improve your association.
After all, you love her.

538
00:53:12,179 --> 00:53:14,418
My cousin is here.

539
00:53:14,554 --> 00:53:19,258
He and the waitress trying to rescue the girl.

00:53:20,804 --> 00:53:23,755
There is a cousin.

541
00:53:34,762 --> 00:53:38,886

607
01:02:40,475 --> 01:02:43,177
Is he one of Rambo?

608
01:02:48,808 --> 01:02:52,008
You are a wonderfully primitive.

609
01:02:58,683 --> 01:03:01,432
We still have time tomorrow.

610
01:03:01,558 --> 01:03:07,591
Cape behind a fishing village.

01:03:43,309 --> 01:03:45,595
Shut up!

618
01:03:45,725 --> 01:03:48,296
I told you to leave him alone.

619
01:03:50,934 --> 01:03:53,304
Stay still!

620
01:04:00,309 --> 01:04:02,595
On your feet on!

621
01:04:19,809 --> 01:04:23,554
There were two Americans
nelivedollaan two days ago.

622
01:04:23,684 --> 01:04:26,599
They bought supplies and
sustainable fishing line.

623
01:04:26,726 --> 01:04:31,015
They went fishing.
They headed to the mountains beings.

624
01:04:31,142 --> 01:04:33,678
They sound like really stupid.

625
01:04:35,434 --> 01:04:39,973
Inland, is a place where surfers
lautojaan worked.

626
01:04:40,101 --> 01:04:44,639
We somehow found it.
We can fly back.

627
01:04:44,767 --> 01:04:48,975
The best surprise them on foot.
How long is the way it is there?

628
01:04:49,101 --> 01:04:52,301
At least a couple of hours.
A couple of hours! Creator!

629
01:04:52,434 --> 01:04:56,345
Shut up!
Are they even the kidnappers?

630
01:04:56,476 --> 01:05:00,221
And whether they are certainly out there?
Do you have a better idea?

631
01:05:00,351 --> 01:05:05,553
I do not mean that the read
"10tapaa to satisfy a man."

632
01:05:05,684 --> 01:05:09,465
At least I do not tickle the dog bags.
I do not kutittanut...

633
01:05:09,601 --> 01:05:13,760
Will you come with us or not?

634
01:05:17,309 --> 01:05:19,300
All right.

635
01:05:19,434 --> 01:05:21,923
But first I need to cool off.

636
01:05:22,059 --> 01:05:24,762
Do you have to cool off?

637
01:05:38,435 --> 01:05:41,635
His words make sense.

638
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:53,715
I beg your pardon.

639
01:06:01,851 --> 01:06:04,885
What are the chances?

640
01:06:05,018 --> 01:06:08,514
It's not options,
if you want to survive.

641
01:06:10,018 --> 01:06:12,969
It is no longer I.

642
01:06:27,518 --> 01:06:32,341
Did you call the police?
I do not, he was killed.

643
01:06:32,477 --> 01:06:36,387
I should have to call
you in the past, but...

644
01:06:36,518 --> 01:06:40,464
The truth is,
that I think I love your daughter.

645
01:06:42,435 --> 01:06:45,054
I'm trying to find him, but...

646
01:06:46,893 --> 01:06:52,096
The possibilities are great.
If I is not before six...

647
01:06:52,227 --> 01:06:58,638
move the money.
Account number is: 46564...

648
01:07:07,727 --> 01:07:12,847
Did you find him? The helicopter is
on the other side of the island.

649
01:07:12,977 --> 01:07:16,508
Lighthouse is behind everything, such as
oletimmekin.

650
01:07:16,644 --> 01:07:20,933
He gets paid the ultimate price!
Masha is the only child.

651
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:24,011
If you can not find Mashaa before six...

652
01:07:25,102 --> 01:07:28,717
I move the money.
Do what you must do.

653
01:07:35,686 --> 01:07:41,931
The helicopter did not return.
He's fine. Is there a problem?

654
01:07:42,061 --> 01:07:44,596
None, which I found out.

655
01:07:50,644 --> 01:07:55,301
I do not want to interrupt your
journey teen, but we have to leave.

656
01:07:55,436 --> 01:07:57,924
Could we try to save his life?

657
01:08:01,144 --> 01:08:05,090
I think I twisted my ankle.
Come on!

658
01:08:05,227 --> 01:08:09,008
We gotta go!
You are really insensitive.

659
01:08:09,144 --> 01:08:14,762
Do not leave me? I will follow.

660
01:08:14,894 --> 01:08:19,101
This is characterized by you!
Even a selfish...

661
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:21,302
sexist jerk!

662
01:08:21,436 --> 01:08:27,799
Look, I'm not decided, that the men
will improve as they get older.

663
01:08:27,936 --> 01:08:33,056
For women do not experience the same.
I understand.

664
01:09:56,853 --> 01:09:59,223
I need to get to the bathroom!

665
01:10:02,395 --> 01:10:05,559
Treat thing.
And käpäläsi keep away from him.

666
01:10:06,645 --> 01:10:08,719
Treat, treat.

667
01:10:21,812 --> 01:10:24,265
Where is he?

668
01:10:41,312 --> 01:10:45,519
How else could ankles?
Well, you hurt ankles.

669
01:10:45,645 --> 01:10:50,516
I'm trying to find it. I walk towards it.
I can see the feet.

670
01:10:50,645 --> 01:10:53,134
What a beauty.

671
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,968

01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:47,312
They are in the valley.

01:17:50,691 --> 01:17:53,854
- See!

700
01:17:53,982 --> 01:17:56,056

Masha herein.
Are you all right?

708

All is well. I was able to get away.
He got away.

709
01:18:37,983 --> 01:18:40,352
Who is behind the kidnapping?

710
01:18:40,566 --> 01:18:42,059
It was...

711
01:18:44,358 --> 01:18:46,976
Hurry up! I dropped the phone!

712
01:18:47,108 --> 01:18:48,849

No more mistakes!

714
01:19:06,691 --> 01:19:10,732
Meloin time with their father.
When a shot is not so much.

715
01:19:14,316 --> 01:19:17,018
What really happened to your father?

716
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:22,933
He was the South Pole...

717
01:19:23,066 --> 01:19:25,555
and he was attacked by...

718
01:19:27,233 --> 01:19:31,097
flock of penguins. They are not
as cute as you might think.

719
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:36,732
It was really difficult to put
on our wedding evening dress.

720
01:19:36,858 --> 01:19:41,681
When I looked in the mirror, I just
thought, how he tried to escape from them.

721
01:19:50,108 --> 01:19:52,513
- You and your...
- He's alive!

722
01:19:52,650 --> 01:19:55,767
He went away for a long time ago.
I do not know him.

723
01:19:55,900 --> 01:20:00,806
<i>But my mother is  crazy.
He is under house arrest.</i>

724
01:20:02,150 --> 01:20:05,065
- What is it?
- Do you hear that?

725
01:20:06,983 --> 01:20:09,732
What do they say?

726
01:20:09,858 --> 01:20:13,022
Melovan They want us there.

727
01:20:13,150 --> 01:20:16,681
I can not believe that,
this place is still there.

728
01:20:26,358 --> 01:20:31,063
Do you understand what he says?
I do not. But he is friendly.

729
01:20:35,817 --> 01:20:38,980
Villains. We need help.
Do you have a phone?

730
01:20:39,109 --> 01:20:45,058
Right! Do you have a phone, such as
iPhone or Blackberry?

731
01:21:56,401 --> 01:21:58,475
Shall We Dance?

732
01:22:14,526 --> 01:22:19,728
You look great.
You do not have a bad self.

733
01:22:22,026 --> 01:22:27,774
We danced in the moonlight in the village.
Is this a dream honeymoon?

734
01:22:29,443 --> 01:22:32,524
Is it yours?

735
01:22:32,651 --> 01:22:35,436
Will you marry me?

736
01:22:36,943 --> 01:22:40,688
Unfortunately, I,
I'm already married.

737
01:23:31,027 --> 01:23:35,684
I was most proud of the third.
I did not cry it all at once.

738
01:23:44,693 --> 01:23:46,684
Let's go.

739
01:23:53,568 --> 01:23:56,235
- Is not it wonderful?
- It is.

740
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:59,975
If you still would have a cappuccino.

741
01:24:04,902 --> 01:24:10,934
Calculator, just kidding.
We do not need no...

742
01:24:21,319 --> 01:24:23,226
High-Good!

743
01:24:29,110 --> 01:24:31,681
You have to get out of here!

744
01:24:31,819 --> 01:24:35,149
Do you speak English?
I used to work on Wall Street.

745
01:24:54,277 --> 01:24:56,019
Grab the magazine and sit on it!

746
01:25:11,361 --> 01:25:12,937
Move!

747
01:25:52,403 --> 01:25:55,899
Go away from him!
Do not go, he will kill you!

748
01:25:56,028 --> 01:25:59,524
Go to farther,
if you want her to live!

749
01:26:09,153 --> 01:26:13,894
Are you all right, Masha?
You are not the savior, he was hired.

750
01:26:14,028 --> 01:26:16,599
What are? I never would do that.

751
01:26:16,736 --> 01:26:19,225
I thought you loved me. I love.

752
01:26:19,361 --> 01:26:22,857
Be honest with me then.

753
01:26:25,861 --> 01:26:28,563
They treated you well?

754
01:26:28,695 --> 01:26:32,143
Why are you doing this?
Because I am ambitious.

755
01:26:32,278 --> 01:26:36,770
As your father. Is not that satisfied with the women?
So you're planning to steal from him?

756
01:26:36,903 --> 01:26:40,600
I did it for you.
We are getting married.

757
01:26:40,736 --> 01:26:43,439
I never would go to marry you!

758
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:47,978
You are a sick, violent and crazy.
I have never loved you.

759
01:26:48,112 --> 01:26:51,358
Honesty I do not think
right now inherit land.

760
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:57,944
What do you say about this?

761
01:26:57,945 --> 01:26:58,940
What do you say about this?

762
01:26:59,070 --> 01:27:03,313
The new husband was kidnapped by you
and I shot him.

763
01:27:03,445 --> 01:27:08,102
But he could push you down the cliff
. A tragic end!

764
01:27:15,112 --> 01:27:17,351
There they are!

765
01:27:51,279 --> 01:27:53,981
The honeymoon is officially over!

766
01:28:03,404 --> 01:28:04,861
Not!

767
01:28:04,987 --> 01:28:07,143

My wife says that you will make
our blessing to stay married.

777

In this! It is a wedding present!

778
01:29:58,738 --> 01:30:01,487
Take it! 9 mm semi-automatic.

Low recoil, double-acting.

Masha, I love you so much.

783
01:30:24,947 --> 01:30:28,063
But I can not be married
of this family.

784
01:30:47,613 --> 01:30:50,979
No, let him go.

01:31:16,780 --> 01:31:20,904
Saparo up. "Saparo". Get it?

786
01:31:27,905 --> 01:31:31,946

All I say.

How about already again?

01:32:04,614 --> 01:32:07,980
Is there a problem? It is a...

793
01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:13,237
It's not.

794
01:33:46,907 --> 01:33:51,481
Need still the residence permit?
What about my family?

795
01:33:51,615 --> 01:33:54,648
