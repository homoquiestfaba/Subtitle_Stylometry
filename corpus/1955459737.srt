Let go.
Take it off.

189
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:02,666
Let go... I got it.
It's acting like a tourniquet.

190

Oh!

191
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,002
Take my watch.

192

Point the hour
hand toward the sun.

193
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:32,747
It'll bisect it with
a 180 degree line.

194
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:33,976
It creates two right angles.

195
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,575
That line is north and south.

196
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,917
Do it.

00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:43,016

that, isn't it?

00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,937
You should lift it up.

It's all right.

00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:48,878
How do I know?

373
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,011
Was your mother into astrology?

374
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:52,713
I have no idea.

375
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:54,552
My wife knew this woman.

376
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:57,491
She was expecting, so she had
the doctor do a caesarian

377
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,186
so the kid
would be a Sagittarius

378
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,627
instead of a Scorpio.

379
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:02,365
So what does that have
to do with anything?

380
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,524
You're a Pisces.

381
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,199
But maybe only because
your mom didn't want you

382
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,397
to be an Aries or a Taurus
or a Leo or some shit.

383
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,564
You saying she messed with
my fate on purpose?

384
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:12,369
Maybe.

385
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,841
No.

386
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,707
No... no!

387
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:16,886
The bag was open, all right?

388
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:17,810
The bottle was in my hand.

389
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:18,870
The decision was made.

390
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,381
Ow!

391
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,483
Are you trying to tell me that
this isn't my destiny?

392
00:37:22,507 --> 00:37:23,717
Is that what you're
trying to say?

393
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,584
It doesn't have to be.

394
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,726
Put that shit down.

395
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:38,157
♪

396
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,700
Hey!

397
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:18,900
Help. help!
Help!

398
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,739
Hey, help!

We're over here!

403

404

We're here!

405

Oh, shit!

406

Hey, help!

407
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:47,995
Mitch, Mitch, Mitch...
Ow, god!

408
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,333
Mitch!

409
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:53,669
Mitch!

410
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:11,790
Man.

411
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,125
Sorry.

412
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,687
You're not a well man.

413
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:17,892
You need attention.

414
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:19,032
It was an accident...
I didn't mean to.

415
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:20,399
What are we gonna do now?

416
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:22,131
No kidding.

417
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:25,936
If I don't make my connection,
you'll be dead too.

418
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:27,271
What?

419
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:29,174
I don't know who I'm
supposed to meet.

420
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:31,144
If I don't make my drop,
they'll send guys after me.

421
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:35,446
And who are you but here
and dead?

422
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:36,507
What drop?

423
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:40,249
There's a sealed GPS tracker
in this bag.

424
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,688
They know my flight
plan, they know exactly

425
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,783
where I'm going to be.

426
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,885
If I'm more than
30 minutes late.

427
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,985
What?

428
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,531
They send guys after you.

429
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:50,864
Are you like some kind
of messenger?

430
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,494
A courier.

431
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,595
This lake has shipping
lanes across it.

432
00:39:56,661 --> 00:39:57,799
Up in the sky there's some

433
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,170
transportation highway
connecting

434
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,834
the bordering states.

435
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,344
Michigan, Indiana,
Illinois, Wisconsin.

436
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,711
They criss-cross it a couple
times a day.

437
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,977
It's faster than driving.

438
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:11,213
And there are no cops.

439
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:14,347
Fact is, I was looking for
their boat or their plane

440
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,723
since you
pulled me out of the water.

441
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:20,661
What would they need you for if
they have access to a plane?

442
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:22,994
Minimize their risk.

443
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:27,696
I get popped,
I'm just a courier.

444
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,465
If I could have got those
skiers attention,

445
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:32,167
could have dumped me off
with them and been on your way

446
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:36,371
and when you were alone,
done the deed.

447
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,380
Now you're in
the middle of my shit.

448
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,279
(coughing)

449
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:49,756
you all right?

450
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:52,124
Fine.

451
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:54,129
I'll take
some of that vodka now.

452
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:06,336
Thanks.

453
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:25,788
What are you doing?

454
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:29,024
I am going fishing.

455
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:30,656
Like that?

456
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:32,132
Yeah.

457
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:34,189
Something my dad and I used
to do when I was a kid.

458
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:42,174
Are you kidding me?

459
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:45,009
They got 100-pound salmon
in this lake.

460
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:47,049
It'll take your toe right off.

461
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:04,656
Oh!
No.

462
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:05,860
Yeah.
No.

463
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:07,231
Yeah.
Did you get a bite?

464
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,929
Watch this.
You got a fish?

465
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:11,234
I do...
Look at this.

466
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,940
It's a walleye.
You got yourself a fish.

467
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:24,111
There's no place to cook it.

468
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:29,523
Too small anyway...
Toss it back.

469
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,957
Throw it back.

470
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:44,731
You all right?

471
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:47,173
Yeah, I'm all right.

472
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:03,516
Here.

473
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:21,402
Where is everybody...
I'm seasick.

474
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:23,672
Put a little pressure
on your wrist.

475
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:25,213
What?

476
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,273
Like this, it'll
help with the seasickness.

477
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:30,512
H ow?

478
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:33,350
Three fingers below
the crease of your wrist.

479
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,481
Put... like that... between
the tendons.

480
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:37,150
Just hold it.

481
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:38,955
I got a broken arm.

482
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:40,586
I'll do it for you.

483
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,371
Like that.

484
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:57,045
Feels weird.

485
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:03,950
You ever try to
kill yourself before?

486
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:05,487
I've thought about it.

487
00:44:05,543 --> 00:44:08,251
Who hasn't?

488
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,451
Actually, I have tried
a couple times.

489
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:11,549
Yeah?

490
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:12,650
Last week, in fact.

491
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:14,787
I was on the bridge
on the south side of town.

492
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:16,796
I just pulled on the wheel of
the car to try to get it

493
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,731
to jump over the guard rail.

494
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,234
I would have fallen 200 feet

495
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:22,897
into the industrial floor below.

496
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,995
What the hell?

497
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:25,768
The curb was too high.

498
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,035
My wheel base was too low.

499
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:28,341
So the car just
kind of banged off the wall

500
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:31,244
and the tire just skidded along.

501
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:34,840
Ever try to do something like
that when you're sober?

502
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:36,111
No.

503
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,813
You were drunk.

504
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:41,220
A little drunk.
A little.

505
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:43,417
Which means it was a botched
attempt, I think.

506
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,323
You think it's easy,
you try it some time.

507
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:47,623
This attempt on the boat
botched too, I think.

508
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,629
I didn't botch this attempt.

509
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,686
You botched it for me.

510
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,064
And I'm not drunk.
Yet.

511
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:53,133
What, you never messed up
this bad?

512
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:54,329
No.
You crashed.

513
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:55,495
Yeah.

514
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:57,270
You crashed your plane
and almost killed yourself.

515
00:44:57,294 --> 00:44:59,069
Yeah, but I wasn't trying
to kill myself.

516
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:00,540
Those skiers
might have rescued you,

517
00:45:00,598 --> 00:45:02,942
which means I'm not responsible
for you if you die.

518
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,308
Me on the other hand...
What?

519
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,779
It's because of me that my
father had a job.

520
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:07,077
Okay.

521
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:09,174
Someone died because of a
decision that I made.

522
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:10,240
Almost like you just did.

523
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:11,377
No way...
I had a choice.

524
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:12,786
With our help...
People have choices.

525
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,585
With our influence...

526
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:16,690
Even if you don't make a choice,
it's a choice. we are who we are.

527
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,625
Your dad... we're
talking about your dad here!

528
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:20,787
Are you a man or a mouse?
We are who we are.

529
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:22,353
You're a mouse.

530
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,300
When I was a child, my mother
used to say to me,

531
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:30,771
"if you had another
brain, it would be lonesome."

532
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:34,037
Talking to you, I finally
understand what she meant.

533
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:41,112
Regret?

534
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:42,946
The worst thing about it

535
00:45:43,007 --> 00:45:49,583
is it's like
a debt you can never repay.

536
00:45:49,647 --> 00:45:51,285
We'll see.

537
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,259
Are you like this with women?

538
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:57,493
Like what?
A pain in the ass.

539
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:59,966
I don't go out much.

540
00:46:00,024 --> 00:46:03,528
You should get a hobby
or exercise more.

541
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,403
You like to
swim, you should swim.

542
00:46:24,048 --> 00:46:28,019
You married?

543
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:32,124
Yeah.

544
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:34,692
Got a picture in my wallet.

545
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:35,828
A fold-out thing.

546
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:37,304
Here.

547
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:54,852
That's my family.

548
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:58,086
Beautiful.

549
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:02,563
We were living
in a really nice house.

550
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:05,099
Way beyond our means, actually

551
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:11,965
Then the economy
tanked and they cut my hours.

552
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:14,566
My wife got laid off.

553
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:16,941
Love you, dad... have a good day.
Mm-hmm.

554
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,538
Love you too.

555
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:22,982
Started looking into anything
including franchises.

556
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,453
There were some
good ones out there.

557
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:33,450
For some reason, the good ones
didn't interest me.

558
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:37,659
There was one in
particular that seemed easy.

559
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:41,692
Wasn't really my thing, but I
had to have something

560
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:45,798
and we were running out of time.

561
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,810
It was that stupid stop sign

562
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,812
at the corner of grey fox
and fourth.

563
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,078
And you're
coming down the big hill

564
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:53,706
and you can see a million
miles each way

565
00:47:53,771 --> 00:47:54,943
that no cars are coming.

566
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:56,325
You have to make that
sharp right.

567
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,017
So what's the point
of coming to a full stop?

568
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,520
Because it's against the law.

569
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:02,557
I've seen you do it...
Why... why do you do this?

570
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:04,524
I don't want to use my
brakes for that.

571
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:05,582
What?

572
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:07,560
I don't want
to use my brakes that much.

573
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:08,926
Why?

574
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:10,130
To save them...
To save money.

575
00:48:10,154 --> 00:48:11,690
Okay, I'll tell you what.

576
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:14,429
Next few times we want
to go out to dinner, we won't.

577
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:17,062
That'll cover the cost
of the brakes.

578
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:19,107
Use your brakes.

579
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:24,942
Got so bad
we almost moved into this

580
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:27,812
really crappy trailer park.

581
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:30,784
So what was the easy franchise?

582
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:33,014
Selling electronic cigarettes.

583
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,384
Can you believe it?

584
00:48:34,444 --> 00:48:38,722
Electronic cigarettes...
Me, a health nut.

585
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:42,025
They don't make real smoke.

586
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,531
I mean.

587
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,329
So I took on more courier hours

588
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:50,497
'cause I wanted to spend
more time with my family.

589
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:52,905
You get the picture.

590
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:54,007
After you've been you've been
in jail a while,

591
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:57,501
would it seem worth it?

592
00:48:57,568 --> 00:49:00,708
At least I'm trying, which is
more than I can say for you.

593
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,546
Really?

594
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:05,018
Look, I've forgotten more about
living than you've ever known.

595
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:08,546
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

596
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,683
You get to be a pilot.

597
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:13,751
How many people in
this world get to be a pilot?

598
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:15,057
You'd be surprised.

599
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,359
Some money and a bunch of hours,

600
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:19,901
you can pilot a plane.

601
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:23,461
Remember, I carry
parcels, not people.

602
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:25,666
It's a whole different
licensing process,

603
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:27,340
if you want to be
rated to fly anything bigger

604
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,742
than a twin engine
six passenger.

605
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,939
Still.

606
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:34,141
I mean, one in nine
people in Alaska

607
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:36,184
have their pilot's license.

608
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,914
Probably out of necessity.

609
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:42,185
(coughing)

610
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:48,262
Oh!

611
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,130
Here.

612
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:03,572
Thanks.

613
00:50:03,634 --> 00:50:05,636
Tastes good.

614
00:50:07,905 --> 00:50:10,317
How's it look?

615
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:11,546
It's okay.

616
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,360
What's your wife's name?
Kim.

617
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:25,889
Kim?

618
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:29,130
You ever think we're kinda
supposed to be like,

619
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,899
what our names are?

620
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:34,067
You know,
like, Robert Brickhouse

621
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:36,771
or Karen light or me,

622
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:39,814
Mitch, Mitch Lowe.

623
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:46,810
Am I supposed to be low 'cause
that's what my name is?

624
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,356
You don't like it, change it.

625
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:50,449
If it doesn't matter,
don't do it.

626
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:51,584
Yeah?

627
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:55,687
What would Kim Enwright have
to say about it?

628
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:59,063
Mrs. Enwright would say...

629
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:00,658
"don't be stupid."

630
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:10,371
They have a new male raptor
at the nature center.

631
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:12,414
Red-tailed hawk.

632
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:18,715
And I just figured out yesterday
that he only has two eyelids.

633
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:23,554
Now all raptors are
supposed to have three eyelids.

634
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:28,119
They have an upper lid
and a lower lid

635
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:30,187
and they have this
third, transparent eyelid

636
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:35,362
that closes laterally
across the eyes.

637
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:38,668
And this one
keeps the eyes moist

638
00:51:38,729 --> 00:51:42,506
and it protects their eyes
when they're flying

639
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:46,309
and it protects their eyes when
they're eating.

640
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:51,149
But this little guy
just doesn't have that.

641
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:57,591
Doesn't have that extra bit
of protection.

642
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:59,820
That's me, Kel.

643
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:03,262
I'm that extra
bit of protection.

644
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,994
You have to let me in.

645
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:08,536
You don't, you
don't have to shoulder

646
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:10,367
everything by yourself, baby,

647
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:13,636
but I can't help
if you don't let me in.

648
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:36,058
(Mitch urinating)

649
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,331
holy cow.

650
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:43,337
Didn't realize we were that
close to Niagara falls.

651
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:44,633
Jeez.

652
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:45,900
Now I gotta take a leak.

653
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:47,964
Got a pail or anything?

654
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:53,307
God... oh god.

655
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:55,475
Put it down there.
Just put it down there.

656
00:52:59,443 --> 00:53:01,650
(urinating)

657
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:12,828
I miss my family.

658
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:15,961
Probably just
getting out of tae kwon do.

659
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,596
Tae kwon do?

660
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:19,402
Yeah, they're probably
going rollerblading

661
00:53:19,463 --> 00:53:20,737
or maybe to a movie.

662
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:22,003
Shit.

663
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:29,011
I think I'm off by an hour or so

664
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:30,750
seeing as how we're
in the middle of a lake.

665
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:32,685
What does the middle of the lake
have to do with anything?

666
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:37,590
Well, we're smack dab
on top of the time zone line.

667
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:39,126
Really?

668
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:42,561
Time's almost right down
the middle of the lake, huh?

669
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:43,563
I didn't know that.

670
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:44,655
Yeah.

671
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,598
(radio signal coming
through intermittently

672
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:48,363
brewers are pretty good
this year.

673
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:49,563
Yeah?

674
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:55,639
(grunting)

675
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:01,412
yeah.
(radio station playing football game)

676
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,951
there you go.

677
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:05,350
That's good.

678
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:12,392
You know what the laws are
in Michigan concerning suicide?

679
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:13,723
Oh, come on.

680
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:16,889
'Cause if we're closer
to Michigan than Wisconsin,

681
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:20,366
there could be stiffer fees
and penalties.

682
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,301
Are you telling me that someone
came up with a law

683
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:24,327
against killing yourself?

684
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:25,930
Of course there's suicide laws.

685
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:29,239
And they differ from
state to state.

686
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:32,371
What do I care...
I'm dead anyway.

687
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:36,110
Somebody's going
to have to dispose of you.

688
00:54:36,173 --> 00:54:38,881
I don't know about Wisconsin,
but Michigan's conservative.

689
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,262
They could come after
your estate.

690
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,017
I don't have much of an estate.

691
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:43,614
Doesn't matter...
You'll still owe it.

692
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,160
Somebody's going to be on
the hook for it.

693
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:47,354
Yeah, how much?

694
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:52,332
Could be as much
as 10 grand, maybe more.

695
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:53,493
Wow.

696
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,705
Oh... god.

697
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:05,736
Oh, come on!

698
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,304
Goodbye, brewers.

699
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:28,127
Any damage?

700
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:38,876
Ow!

701
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:40,972
Ah!

702
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:42,607
That's gotta hurt.

703
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:48,020
Man.

704
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:54,451
They wear helmets?

705
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,087
Who?

706
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:57,460
The kids, when they rollerblade.

707
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,329
They wear helmets?

708
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:00,666
I don't know...
They probably do.

709
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,601
They wear those wrist
guard things.

710
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:04,670
That's good, but you gotta
make sure they wear helmets,

711
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,071
every single time.

712
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:07,773
I mean, they're
gonna fall... it's guaranteed.

713
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:08,837
What are you so hot about?

714
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,344
If somebody told you that soon,

715
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,970
you were gonna fall on
the concrete

716
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,646
at 10 to 15 miles an hour,
you'd protect yourself.

717
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,081
Right? yeah, probably
I would, yeah.

718
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:17,641
Yeah, of course you would.

719
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:24,090
♪

720
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:29,527
Have you ever split up with
someone and both of you decide

721
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:31,862
not to talk to each other
for a few weeks,

722
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:34,094
you know, to kind of see
what it feels like,

723
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:37,764
if you miss each other and all?

724
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:40,205
Yeah.

725
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:42,504
Yeah?

726
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:46,172
Yeah, but not for two weeks.

727
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:52,850
But I mean, you think
it's common?

728
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,446
That people do that?

729
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:57,185
I don't know.

730
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:07,800
Laurie suggested that we
do that.

731
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:08,892
That's not good.

732
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:10,403
Yeah.

733
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:13,134
Wasn't my idea.

734
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:17,167
During that time, she went out
with her girlfriend.

735
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:23,582
She said she met somebody
and that he was her soul mate.

736
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:29,113
Then she went on a trip with
him to new york.

737
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:32,956
They went
rollerblading in central park.

738
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:36,725
She fell down and cracked
her head open.

739
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:41,394
She died.

740
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:45,099
Jeez.

741
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:50,634
How long were you two together?

742
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:54,944
Not long, but. I think she
might have said yes

743
00:57:55,004 --> 00:57:58,781
if I would have
asked her to marry me.

744
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:00,480
Maybe she would have.

745
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:03,922
Nobody

746
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:07,427
Nobody ever
made me feel like that before.

747
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,157
What are the chances of
that happening,

748
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:10,391
meeting somebody so fast?

749
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:12,433
Why didn't she just talk to me?

750
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,490
You know?

751
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:15,101
I mean, if she was feeling
something before,

752
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:19,631
why wouldn't she have just...

753
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:22,734
Maybe there's something that
I could have done different.

754
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,043
Should I have done something,
should I have done more,

755
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:25,205
should I have tried harder?

756
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:28,044
Don't do that to yourself.

757
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:29,981
Not worth it.

758
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:51,435
I don't even have a picture
of her.

759
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,354
We're sinking.
What?

760
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,219
Look at the back of the boat.

761
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:10,121
Shit.

762
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,750
Whatever knocked off
the propeller

763
00:59:11,815 --> 00:59:15,092
when I ran over your plane
must have punctured the hull.

764
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:18,257
Great... now we're the
Edmund-fucking-Fitzgerald.

765
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:19,465
We're going to have
to shift our weight

766
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:21,196
to the front of the boat.

767
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:40,076
Not them?
No.

768
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:43,215
What's in the bag, Kelly?

769
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:45,190
Cash.

770
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:46,559
I was supposed
to pick up a container

771
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,894
at a pre-determined time
and location.

772
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:52,331
What's in the container?
I don't know.

773
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:54,334
You don't know...
What do you think?

774
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:55,830
I know it could be one
of two things,

775
00:59:55,859 --> 00:59:58,237
considering it's
black market and all.

776
00:59:58,294 --> 01:00:02,902
Drugs, maybe...
Probably.

777
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:04,138
Maybe body parts.

778
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,770
Black market body parts?

779
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:07,280
There's a shortage.

780
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:09,874
Kidneys, hearts, eyeballs.

781
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,250
People stop
filling out the donor box

782
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,311
on their driver's license.

783
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:15,788
How much do you
charge for an eyeball?

784
01:00:15,845 --> 01:00:19,315
I decided what my stock answer
would be if I got caught.

785
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:21,885
That I was going
to an air show in Osh Kosh,

786
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:23,225
but I wasn't going to Osh Kosh.

787
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:25,698
I was going to an
airport outside of Milwaukee.

788
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:28,099
How did they get you mixed up
in all this?

789
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:31,502
No other pilots available.

790
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:34,440
I hear about this shit...
I know what's going on.

791
01:00:34,497 --> 01:00:38,001
Probably $125,000
in this backpack.

792
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:42,812
$125,000 in that backpack
right there?

793
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:45,375
Poor choice on their part.

794
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:46,385
I want to see.

795
01:00:46,442 --> 01:00:47,978
The backpack's lined with
Kevlar.

796
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:49,522
You can't open it.
We'll see about that.

797
01:00:49,546 --> 01:00:53,995
No, I don't get
paid if the seal is broken.

798
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,587
So we'll reseal it.
No, no.

799
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,862
It's sealed electronically with
UPC or something like that.

800
01:00:59,923 --> 01:01:01,402
It's not possible.

801
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:02,902
You ever try
to put the plastic seal

802
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:05,735
back on a bottle of
a salad dressing?

803
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:07,502
No way to.

804
01:01:07,564 --> 01:01:09,373
You can't open it.

805
01:01:09,432 --> 01:01:11,912
Why not?

806
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:13,470
I want to get paid.

807
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:23,082
(sea gull cawing)

808
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:32,498
is it true what they say, Kelly,

809
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:33,967
that up in the sky,
a ship's wake

810
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:38,665
is visible for up to 10 hours?

811
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:40,674
A ship?

812
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,835
Is that what you see?

813
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:44,173
Haven't you ever been to

814
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:45,744
the museum of science
and industry in Chicago?

815
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:46,769
Of course.

816
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:48,281
Who hasn't in the Midwest?

817
01:01:48,338 --> 01:01:50,340
Remember learning that?

818
01:01:50,406 --> 01:01:52,249
What?

819
01:01:58,314 --> 01:02:00,123
My mom, dad and I went on
a family trip once

820
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:02,026
up in door county.

821
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:04,497
I was a teenager.

822
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:05,965
We were at the beach
and we all went to the water

823
01:02:05,989 --> 01:02:07,491
at the same time.

824
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:10,231
My mom and I, we went
swimming immediately.

825
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:12,933
My dad didn't follow us in.

826
01:02:12,996 --> 01:02:14,436
She said he
was probably hanging back

827
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:18,606
because he was so spooked
from the year before.

828
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:20,443
And not knowing, I said,

829
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:23,416
"what happened
the year before?"

830
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:29,253
She said that between the cold
water and a hearty wave,

831
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:31,883
he got overpowered
and for a moment,

832
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:34,485
in the lake that he loved,

833
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:37,156
he was drowning.

834
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:38,824
Huh.

835
01:02:38,888 --> 01:02:41,494
And that afternoon, I went
swimming with him, alone.

836
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:42,968
Just me and my dad.

837
01:02:43,026 --> 01:02:45,199
I helped him through his fear.

838
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:48,140
And all he
had to say about it was,

839
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:51,838
"if I ever die before
your mother,

840
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:55,815
when she passes,
make sure she's cremated

841
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:57,510
so she doesn't
get cold."

842
01:02:57,573 --> 01:02:58,984
Hmm.

843
01:03:11,554 --> 01:03:14,330
Jerky.

844
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:18,634
Forgot.

845
01:03:18,695 --> 01:03:20,265
That's all I got.

846
01:03:23,499 --> 01:03:25,445
Really?

847
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:28,812
Asshole holdout.

848
01:03:28,871 --> 01:03:30,111
Yeah.

849
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:46,692
Joseph Lowe?

850
01:03:46,756 --> 01:03:48,235
My dad.

851
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:52,569
What?

852
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:56,201
Come on, Mitch, give me
the long and short of it.

853
01:03:56,265 --> 01:04:00,304
On second thought, just
give me the short.

854
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:03,907
My dad typically bounced
around from job to job.

855
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:06,977
The beginning of the year,

856
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:10,047
he found himself
running low on opportunities.

857
01:04:10,113 --> 01:04:13,754
With my mom basically
brain-dead,

858
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:18,094
he was getting lonely.

859
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:20,100
So he was hired to do some
general work

860
01:04:20,156 --> 01:04:25,538
around the warehouse.

861
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:27,734
I got him the job.

862
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:30,107
I taught him what to do.

863
01:04:37,673 --> 01:04:38,981
He was killed.

864
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:53,431
His head was crushed.

865
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:55,491
Man.

866
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,299
Your dad?

867
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:02,332
I was the one who told him to
go help out with the semi.

868
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:03,675
I should have
been the one to help.

869
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:06,976
He was not experienced enough
to do that job.

870
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:09,642
Here...
You take this.

871
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:12,083
Fucking do it.

872
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:15,452
I'd kill myself if I saw
something like that.

873
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:18,117
I can't get
the image out of my head.

874
01:05:18,181 --> 01:05:20,957
It just plays over and over
and over again.

875
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:23,497
I just keep seeing it.

876
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:31,531
The insurance company voided his
policy on a technicality

877
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:35,098
They said that, um.

878
01:05:35,164 --> 01:05:38,668
Due to his
advanced age and condition,

879
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:41,874
he wasn't suitable for the kind
of work I had him doing.

880
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,315
Jeez, Mitch.

881
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:45,477
Nobody's gonna...
The insurance company basically

882
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:47,101
confirmed the fact that
it was my fault.

883
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:48,588
Nobody's gonna want to be
near you.

884
01:05:48,644 --> 01:05:52,217
You gotta talk
to someone about that.

885
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:55,421
But you can just kill yourself.

886
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:58,954
We gotta get
the water out of this boat.

887
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:01,262
We gotta get the water out
of this boat.

888
01:06:01,324 --> 01:06:03,531
Gotta get the water out.

889
01:06:03,593 --> 01:06:05,834
Come on.

890
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:07,568
We got to get you in the bow...
Come on.

891
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,268
Get away from the water.

892
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:11,573
Come on.

893
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:15,776
Be careful.

894
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:17,511
The water.

895
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:24,523
You need a dog.

896
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:25,752
Why-you got a dog?

897
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:27,795
Yeah.

898
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:29,022
What's it's name?

899
01:06:29,085 --> 01:06:31,793
Joey.

900
01:06:31,854 --> 01:06:33,299
What kind is he?

901
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:39,864
Dachshund, rescue dog...
Greatest dog in the world.

902
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:42,739
We were in the woods
a couple years ago

903
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:44,744
and he got shot.

904
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,108
No.

905
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:50,412
Yeah... hunter
mistook him for a raccoon.

906
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:55,047
His hips and his legs
are useless.

907
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:59,787
One evening, I was reading
the paper in the living room

908
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:01,624
and I farted really loud.

909
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:04,858
(chuckling)

910
01:07:04,921 --> 01:07:09,301
Joey just looked at me and
wheeled himself out of the room.

911
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:13,465
(laughing)

912
01:07:17,233 --> 01:07:21,443
that's a good story.

913
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:24,974
You gave him that opportunity.

914
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:30,354
You couldn't prevent
what happened.

915
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:34,225
Same thing
with your ex-girlfriend.

916
01:07:34,283 --> 01:07:36,593
Couldn't prevent what happened.

917
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:43,594
Thanks, Kelly.

918
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:51,036
(electronic beeping)

919
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,670
what, it's a bomb now?

920
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:54,214
GPS tracker.

921
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:56,216
They must be getting close.

922
01:07:57,506 --> 01:08:00,248
(grunting)

923
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:02,653
here, hold on...
Hold on.

924
01:08:02,712 --> 01:08:03,850
This cramp in my arm.

925
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,620
Just breathe...
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

926
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:06,785
Oh, god.
Breathe.

927
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:08,226
Breathe...
Take a deep breathe.

928
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:10,662
Take a deep breath, come on.

929
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:14,668
I want my wife.

930
01:08:14,724 --> 01:08:17,398
I want my wife.

931
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:20,566
(groaning)

932
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:27,745
here.

933
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:34,516
How do you figure out
the shit that women do?

934
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:40,858
Or men for that matter?

935
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:42,293
You all right?

936
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:43,489
Kelly?

937
01:08:43,552 --> 01:08:46,795
Hey!

938
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:48,529
And that name thing.

939
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:50,901
You know,
where we are our names.

940
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,907
Reflections of things.

941
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:57,342
Okay, what about it?

942
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,880
High to low.

943
01:08:59,935 --> 01:09:03,144
High to low?
High to low.

944
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:07,153
High to low, top to bottom.

945
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:09,086
I don't understand.

946
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:14,493
Top to bottom.

947
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:16,757
Yeah... you okay... don't
close your eyes... hey, Kelly!

948
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:17,996
Don't close your eyes,
all right?

949
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:19,380
Can you keep
your eyes open for me?

950
01:09:19,422 --> 01:09:21,182
It's not time to sleep
right now... you okay?

951
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:23,464
Balancing.
What?

952
01:09:23,526 --> 01:09:24,698
Balance?

953
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,603
Time.

954
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:27,834
The time.

955
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:29,274
The time?
The time.

956
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:34,508
The time...
You want to know the time?

957
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:35,570
I got your watch.

958
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:38,813
The time, the time
in Michigan is 6:17.

959
01:09:38,874 --> 01:09:41,650
It's 6:17!

960
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:43,815
It's 6:17 at home,
okay?

961
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:45,859
Kelly, open your eyes...
Open your eyes.

962
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:47,553
Come on... come on!

963
01:09:47,616 --> 01:09:48,754
Just stop it.

964
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:50,661
All right... well, just
stay with me.

965
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,995
Just breathe, okay?

966
01:09:55,558 --> 01:09:59,734
Anxiety will kill you.

967
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:04,504
Often times I think of that
guy who got arrested

968
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:11,348
trying to bulldoze down
this free-standing ATM machine.

969
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:15,082
Yeah?

970
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:20,218
You okay...
I don't understand.

971
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:22,421
Think of the anxiety

972
01:10:22,485 --> 01:10:24,192
The stress that guy was feeling.

973
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:40,170
I realize...
What was I talking about?

974
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:42,238
You were talking about somebody
with an ATM machine

975
01:10:42,304 --> 01:10:44,841
and stress
or anxiety or something.

976
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,545
Oh!

977
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:48,350
You all right?
My head!

978
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:49,320
It's okay.

979
01:10:49,378 --> 01:10:50,422
Hey, it's all right, just
breath.

980
01:10:50,446 --> 01:10:53,393
Where am I?
Just breathe.

981
01:10:53,449 --> 01:10:54,393
Hey!

982
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:55,190
Hold on now.

983
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,458
Come on, breathe...
Breathe.

984
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,931
You gotta breathe.

985
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:01,468
Breathe, come on!

986
01:11:01,524 --> 01:11:03,526
Kelly!

987
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:05,765
Kelly, you gotta breathe!

988
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:07,432
Breathe!

989
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:09,635
Breathe, take
a deep breath, come on!

990
01:11:09,698 --> 01:11:10,698
Shit!

991
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:12,269
Come on, man.

992
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:13,472
Come here.

993
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,110
All right, come on.

994
01:11:19,175 --> 01:11:20,950
Come on, you ready...
Here we go.

995
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:22,990
One, two, three.

996
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:27,460
Come on, come on.

997
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:29,757
One, two, three.

998
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:32,264
Come on, man.

999
01:11:32,321 --> 01:11:33,459
Good.

1000
01:11:33,522 --> 01:11:35,229
You okay?

1001
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,794
Good.

1002
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:38,861
That's right.

1003
01:11:38,928 --> 01:11:43,070
(phone ringing)

1004
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:50,509
hello?

1005
01:11:50,573 --> 01:11:51,517
(man)
Kelly.

1006
01:11:51,574 --> 01:11:53,520
Uh, who's this?

1007
01:11:53,576 --> 01:11:55,419
Is this Kelly?

1008
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:56,922
I need to speak with Kelly.

1009
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:58,356
Can you tell me who you are?

1010
01:11:58,414 --> 01:12:00,025
I have been trying to reach
Kelly all day.

1011
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:02,222
I understand, but I need
to know who you are.

1012
01:12:02,284 --> 01:12:04,059
Is he the one the boat with you?

1013
01:12:10,593 --> 01:12:13,802
Give us the backpack.

1014
01:12:13,862 --> 01:12:15,603
Do you have it?

1015
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:17,234
You want the backpack?

1016
01:12:17,299 --> 01:12:19,745
Fine.

1017
01:12:19,802 --> 01:12:21,338
You want the backpack?

1018
01:12:21,403 --> 01:12:22,403
Take it.

1019
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:31,017
(dialing)

1020
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,582

9-1-1, can I help you?

1021
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:34,958
Yes, hello,
is this 9-1-1?

1022
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:36,428
Hello?
9-1-1, may I help you?

1023
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:39,091
Hi, we're... we need emergency
assistance right away.

1024
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:40,098
What is
the nature of the emergency?

1025
01:12:40,155 --> 01:12:41,532
I have a plane crash victim.

1026
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:44,503
He's in his mid-50s and he's
in convulsions.

1027
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:45,560
Where are you located?

1028
01:12:45,594 --> 01:12:47,130
We're on lake Michigan.

1029
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,732
In a little boat that's sinking.

1030
01:12:48,797 --> 01:12:50,442
You need to be more specific
about your location.

1031
01:12:50,466 --> 01:12:51,910
I don't know... we're in
a small sinking boat.

1032
01:12:51,934 --> 01:12:53,072
We're on the lake.

1033
01:12:53,135 --> 01:12:54,446
I hope that's Milwaukee
over there.

1034
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:55,744
Okay, can you be more specific?

1035
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:57,015
No, I can't be any
more specific!

1036
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:58,347
We're in the middle of a lake!

1037
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:00,944
Please try to remain calm.
Please come.

1038
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:02,387
Hello?

1039
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:14,833
All right, here's what
we're going to do.

1040
01:13:14,857 --> 01:13:15,934
Here's what we're going to do.

01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:17,301
You all right, buddy?

1042
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:18,360
We're going to call Kim.

1043
01:13:18,427 --> 01:13:20,668
How about that...
Is she in here?

1044
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:22,504
I'm going to call Kim right now.

1045
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:23,508
There it is.

1046
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:24,565
Kim.

1047
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:25,601
Calling Kim right now.

1048
01:13:25,668 --> 01:13:26,612
You want to talk to her?

1049
01:13:26,669 --> 01:13:27,613
(Kim)
Kelly?

1050
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:28,614
Is this Kim?

1051
01:13:28,671 --> 01:13:29,671
Kelly, where are you?

1052
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:30,649
No, no, this isn't Kelly.

1053
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:31,741
This isn't Kelly.

1054
01:13:31,807 --> 01:13:33,013
I have Kelly here, he's hurt.

1055

My god, it's been hours.

1056
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:36,515
He's hurt, but he wants
to say hi to you.

1057
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:37,578
He can hear you.

1058
01:13:37,613 --> 01:13:39,991
Okay, so say hi.

1059
01:13:40,049 --> 01:13:40,993
Okay, say hi.

1060
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:42,188
He can hear you.

1061
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,559
Kelly, did something happen?

1062
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:44,563
Can you say hi?
(grunts)

1063
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:45,724
Kelly, are you okay?

1064
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:47,096

hear her?

Hello?

Hello, Kim?

1069

It's all right, she heard you.

She heard you,
she knows you're okay.

1071

All right, it's going
to be okay.
