1
00:01:39,256 --> 00:01:42,692
Late last night and the night before

2
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:46,217
Tommyknockers, Tommyknockers
knocking at the door

3
00:01:46,296 --> 00:01:49,697
I want to go out
but I don't know if I can

4
00:01:49,766 --> 00:01:52,530
because I am so afraid
of the Tommyknocker man.

5
00:01:52,602 --> 00:01:55,366
Bobbi.

6
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,134
Late last and the night before

7
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:01,644
Tommyknockers, Tommyknockers
knocking at the door.

8
00:02:01,711 --> 00:02:05,647
I want to go out but
I don't know if I can

9
00:02:05,715 --> 00:02:09,446
because I am so afraid
of the Tommyknocker man.

10
00:02:12,656 --> 00:02:14,146
Hilly, stop it!

11
00:02:14,224 --> 00:02:15,919
I want to go out but I don't know if I can

12
00:02:15,992 --> 00:02:18,790
because I am so afraid
of the Tommyknocker man.

13
00:02:18,862 --> 00:02:21,092
- Mom make him stop!.
- You are afraid.

14
00:02:21,164 --> 00:02:23,132
No.

15
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,724
All right, Hilly, stop torturing your brother.
and get ready for school. - But Mom!

16
00:02:25,802 --> 00:02:28,669
Hey Hilly, don't argue with your mom.

17
00:02:28,738 --> 00:02:31,400
I want you to come straight home after
school today. OK? You've got chores.

18
00:02:31,474 --> 00:02:33,942
Yeah, says you're only a kid once.

19
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,375
Yeah, gramps doesn't pay the bills around here.

20
00:02:35,445 --> 00:02:38,380
I do, and as long as I do, you're gonna
do what I tell you, right?

21
00:02:38,448 --> 00:02:40,313
Yes, sir... oopss

22
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:43,000
- Damn it, Hilly!
- Sorry....

23
00:02:44,254 --> 00:02:45,313
Wait up Hilly!.

24
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:48,300
...and don't slam the... door...

25
00:02:55,498 --> 00:02:58,956
Hilly without accidents is as
McDonalds without hamburgers.
-Yeahh...

26
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:01,000
You were a little hard on him.

27
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,566
Well, somebody's got be tough on him.

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,300
Your dad spoils him rotten.

29
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,000
Well, those boys are his whole life.

30
00:03:13,983 --> 00:03:16,178
Thirty new tricks.

31
00:03:16,252 --> 00:03:19,688
Hours of fun for the young presti...

32
00:03:19,756 --> 00:03:22,224
prestit-gita-tor?

33
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:24,500
Ha, ha... that's magician in plain english.

34
00:03:25,562 --> 00:03:26,393
You're ok?

35
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:32,000
It's cool!

36
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:34,027
Except...

37
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:37,000
Except for what?

38
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,168
Well, Dad says there's no such
thing as magic.

39
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:42,000
Dads forget things being dads.

40
00:03:43,346 --> 00:03:45,110
That's what happens to grown-ups.

41
00:03:46,182 --> 00:03:49,000
- But your're a grown-up...
- Nooo, I'm an old man.

42
00:03:49,853 --> 00:03:52,000
Kids and old people, we know that magic's real,

43
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,454
no matter what anybody says.

44
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,600
There's even a place... that's magic.

45
00:04:00,029 --> 00:04:01,758
A place?

46
00:04:01,831 --> 00:04:04,232
Yes, old Bobbi Anderson farm.

47
00:04:05,301 --> 00:04:08,000
In my day, we called it "Big Injun Woods".

48
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,799
But it's called "Burning Woods" now.

49
00:04:10,874 --> 00:04:13,640
But no matter what it's called,
there's magic there.

50
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:17,000
The Injuns believed it and so do I.

51
00:04:18,248 --> 00:04:22,000
- You mean, they're haunted?
- Yup... magic spirits.

52
00:04:22,585 --> 00:04:25,520
You have to your witts when you go there...

53
00:04:25,588 --> 00:04:29,888
And Hilly... never, never go there alone.

54
00:04:31,628 --> 00:04:34,791
Ok, David, let's use your thumb, shall we?
There you go...

55
00:04:34,864 --> 00:04:36,991
All right, there.

56
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:40,597
Good... Perfect!

57
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:43,696
You see? That's how we fingerprint our suspects.

58
00:04:43,773 --> 00:04:48,142
See that? Everybody?
Over here... come on, over here...

59
00:04:48,211 --> 00:04:51,112
This.... this is where we have our cells.

60
00:04:51,181 --> 00:04:54,810
And we put all the people who break
the law in here.

61
00:04:54,884 --> 00:04:58,251
Ok, and then down here, this is the
dispatcher's station...

62
00:04:58,321 --> 00:05:01,722
where Mrs. Paulson answers all the
important police calls.

63
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,089
Don't you Mrs. Paulson?

64
00:05:06,095 --> 00:05:08,427
Yes I do!

65
00:05:08,498 --> 00:05:11,990
Ok, come on in here, let's go see the school room.

66
00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:14,696
This is the best part. Come on.

67
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:19,834
You see, when I was a little girl,
my parents used to travel a lot.

68
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:23,000
Every time they went to a new country
they would bring me another doll.

69
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:29,000
So, I have dolls from Africa, and East Asia,
and from all over the world.

70
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,880
Dolls were your hobby?

71
00:05:30,954 --> 00:05:32,500
Oh, yes! They are my hobby.

72
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,182
My friends know that I like them so
every time they travel they bring me one.

73
00:05:39,295 --> 00:05:40,785
Oh, no, Donna! We do not break anything, do we?.

74
00:05:40,864 --> 00:05:43,100
Oh, that's all right, well, Jojo's never
been broken.

75
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,000
Go ahead, pull up.

76
00:05:45,635 --> 00:05:47,627
My name is Jojo what's yours?

77
00:05:57,013 --> 00:06:00,139
- They are bad! I'm scared!
- David, it's ok, sweetheart.

78
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:03,842
Come on children.

79
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,556
Tell you what... why don't you come back


80
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:17,793
some other time and we'll see them together?
ok? All alone, just you and me? all right?

81
00:06:18,902 --> 00:06:20,029
- Bye, Davey.
- Bye

82
00:06:41,124 --> 00:06:44,025
Now, one of you scared that little boy...

83
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,322
Come on... Which one of you scared
that little boy?

84
00:07:16,492 --> 00:07:18,517
Haven Post office. Joe Paulson.

85
00:07:18,595 --> 00:07:22,224
- Mmm, hi Joe, it's me.
- Hi, hon.

86
00:07:22,298 --> 00:07:24,000
I'll be right home at 6 o'clock.

87
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,959
because I'm making that chicken
Kiev that those ruskies eat...

88
00:07:27,036 --> 00:07:29,504
it scorch raw butter when you stick
your fork in it.

89
00:07:29,572 --> 00:07:32,564
Oh, honey, I'm sorry... I think
I'm gonna have to work late tonight.

90
00:07:32,642 --> 00:07:35,076
Oh, Joe, come on... not again!

91
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,103
You know that new post mistress
it's a real tirant.

92
00:07:39,182 --> 00:07:40,774
Oh, yeah, honey... she's much harder

93
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,000
on me than old Charlie Ester, but for sure.

94
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,800
Yeah, would you tell her for me that Becka Paulson

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,700
likes her husband home for dinner.

96
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,518
Yeah, honey I will... I gotta go now...
- Bye..

97
00:07:55,832 --> 00:07:58,164
That woman's gonna be the death to him.

98
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:02,402
- Are you ready?
- Am I ready? Is that your question?

99
00:08:02,472 --> 00:08:08,411
Am I ready? It's like the sign says,
neither the snow nor the rain...

100
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:11,675

101
00:08:11,748 --> 00:08:16,048
- can stop these courier.
- From swift completion...

102
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,424
... of their appointed route.

103
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:32,429
To be buried in buffalo skins...

104
00:08:34,203 --> 00:08:37,798
rather than in coffins...

105
00:08:51,554 --> 00:08:53,000
What are you looking at?

106
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,652


107
00:08:56,726 --> 00:08:58,694
ok, let's go!... come on!

108
00:09:13,276 --> 00:09:15,700
All right, one more time... ready?
Ready?

109
00:09:18,347 --> 00:09:19,939
Go get it!

110
00:09:22,685 --> 00:09:25,950
What's the matter?
Don't you see where it went?

111
00:09:43,072 --> 00:09:44,937
I'm ok, l'm ok.

112
00:09:49,378 --> 00:09:51,710
What, what, what?
What's the matter with you?

113
00:09:51,781 --> 00:09:53,182
What? It's just a can.

114
00:10:12,502 --> 00:10:13,500
Weird.

115
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,500
What's the matter with you?

116
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:48,000
ok! ok! we go home.

117
00:10:50,573 --> 00:10:51,767
Come on!

118
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:15,000
I'd like you to meet a new friend
of ours from Maine...

119
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,000
James Gardener.

120
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,000
Hi, I'm Jim, and I am an alcoholic.

121
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,269
Hi Jim.

122
00:11:22,338 --> 00:11:24,700
I haven't had a drink in about a year now...

123
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,000
not that I don't want one all the time.

124
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,300
Hell I don't...

125
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,700
The thing with me and booze is that
basically, I have a bad containment system.

126
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,000
You know, it's like there's this
technician in here... somewhere

127
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,500
that should've been fired like a long time ago.

128
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,500
And when I drink I turn into this stranger...

129
00:11:42,258 --> 00:11:47,000
who does the stupidest crazy things.

130
00:11:49,765 --> 00:11:51,000
A monster.

131
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,300
And you know, my friend, Bobbi, she always says:

132
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,970
Knowing is one thing, but doing something
about it is... another... well,

133
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,409
Anyway, the problem is, I've got this poem
that I have to read in public.

134
00:12:05,481 --> 00:12:10,612
It's probably the last chance to see if I can
hack it on the circuit as a poet.

135
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:12,620


136
00:12:20,496 --> 00:12:24,125
Well, I'm scare to death I'm gonna
need to drink to do it.

137
00:12:28,104 --> 00:12:29,901
 I'm scare to death.

138
00:12:43,185 --> 00:12:45,300
I appreciate you bringing this to me, Butch, but...

139
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,500
you could have called it in or fax it to me...

140
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,100
All part of the service, Ruthie.

141
00:12:54,297 --> 00:12:55,000
Thank you.

142
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:02,700
Um... any plans on coming up
to Derry sometime.

143
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,000
No, not in a near future.
Why?

144
00:13:05,641 --> 00:13:07,500
No reason... just wondering.

145
00:13:13,115 --> 00:13:14,000
Ladies...

146
00:13:17,787 --> 00:13:19,448
Bye, Butch.
- Bye...

147
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:30,588
What?

148
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,759
I think he's sweet on you.

149
00:13:32,835 --> 00:13:34,800
Don't be ridiculous.

150
00:13:50,987 --> 00:13:52,800
I'll be back in about an hour, boys.
Anything new?

151
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:57,253
All quiet on this front, captain.
When're you gonna ask that Merril woman
out on a date?.

152
00:13:57,326 --> 00:14:01,000
Don't you guys have something better to do than
worry about my private life jingles?

153
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:04,260
Like checking all the diners in northern Maine

154
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,699
for health violations or something?

155
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:09,703
You can bark all you want to,
but just because she was your partner's wife

156
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,831
and a damned fine constable, besides,

157
00:14:11,907 --> 00:14:13,700
there's no reason not to speak your heart.

158
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,176
Let it be, fellas, let it be...

159
00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:18,270
Ben's right, time's going by...

160
00:14:18,347 --> 00:14:20,500
and neither of you is getting any younger...

161
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:21,543
Becka...

162
00:14:22,618 --> 00:14:25,000
You get away from that window,
and go back to work, please?

163
00:14:51,147 --> 00:14:52,774
Hilly?

164
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,000
- Go to sleep kiddo.
- What abou you?

165
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,947
I'm reading about Harry Houdini.

166
00:15:00,022 --> 00:15:02,000
- Who's that?
- Greatest magician in history.

167
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm gonna be just like him some day.
Go to sleep, kid.

168
00:15:15,938 --> 00:15:17,838
The hot water here is really shut.

169
00:15:17,907 --> 00:15:19,568
I thought I get us a new one while you're gone.

170
00:15:19,642 --> 00:15:22,440
No, let's just see if we keep the old one going
for a few weeks...

171
00:15:22,511 --> 00:15:25,173
- I'll buy us a new one when I get back.
- Okay...

172 
00:15:25,247 --> 00:15:28,011
Oh, Pete and I found a great cash of 
firewood today.

173
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,000
Mm-mm ... Haven't started the novel, uh?

174
00:15:32,321 --> 00:15:35,586


175
00:15:35,658 --> 00:15:37,922
there's no reason to rub it in.

176
00:15:37,993 --> 00:15:40,223
So, that sexy young school merm

177
00:15:40,296 --> 00:15:43,026
and the buffalo hunter haven't got together yet?

178
00:15:43,099 --> 00:15:44,500
I hate you.

179
00:15:47,236 --> 00:15:48,300
You ok?

180
00:15:50,773 --> 00:15:52,000
Hey, never better, Bobbi.

181
00:15:54,543 --> 00:15:56,000
Never better.

182
00:16:32,915 --> 00:16:37,215
It's just a storm, buddy.
It's just a storm, go back to sleep.

183
00:16:53,903 --> 00:16:56,929
Mmm... here's some nice mashed
for those old teeth.

184
00:17:08,417 --> 00:17:10,715
Todd, it's not my imagination, right?

185
00:17:10,786 --> 00:17:13,448
The vision in his right eye does seem to be returning. 

186
00:17:13,522 --> 00:17:15,956
Let's take a closer look, shall we?

187
00:17:20,563 --> 00:17:22,053
Sorry, he's never like this.

188
00:17:22,131 --> 00:17:25,430
- Peter!.
- Dr. Etheridge, come quick!

189
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:27,731
I'm afraid you will have to excuse me.

190
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,632
Hey, hey... what's...? Pete!

191
00:18:08,944 --> 00:18:11,435
Hey lady... why don't you get your dog out of here?

192
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:22,000
Our last poet is no stranger to

193
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,000
those of you who remember "Raging Angel".

194
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,500
The book that some critics claimed...

195
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,423
gave authority to voice to the angst
of the last decade.

196
00:18:30,499 --> 00:18:35,527
I trust he will provide us with a
memorable finish reading us his latest work.

197
00:18:35,604 --> 00:18:40,800
Friends of new poetry,
I give you James Eric Gardener.

198
00:18:45,981 --> 00:18:47,000
Gardener.

199
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,790
Good evening.

200
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:11,768
I was going to try to leave up to my reputation...

201
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,277
and read something new and angry tonight.

202
00:19:16,345 --> 00:19:18,336
But instead I think I'll be a little umpredictable

203
00:19:18,414 --> 00:19:20,644
and read something from my first book.

204
00:19:20,716 --> 00:19:24,652
<i > It's a love poem called: One more mile </i>.

205
00:19:26,088 --> 00:19:28,000
It's for Bobbi Anderson.

206
00:19:29,391 --> 00:19:31,000
Only for you.

207
00:19:32,961 --> 00:19:36,021
I was raised to believe God was love...

208
00:19:36,098 --> 00:19:37,332
But how loving can God be

209
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,500
when he makes man and woman
smart enough...

210
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,500
to land on the moon...

211
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,306
but stupid enough to have to learn
that there's no such thing as forever?

212
00:19:45,374 --> 00:19:48,138
Only have to learn it over and over again.

213
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:52,207
One more mile. Just one more mile.

214
00:19:52,281 --> 00:19:56,149
Then one day I dreamed I found you...

215
00:19:56,218 --> 00:20:02,248
Illusion made substance,
in a dream realer than any....

216
00:20:02,324 --> 00:20:05,782
...Your eyes looked up at me
and saw the me...

217
00:20:05,861 --> 00:20:08,421
... After all these doubts and all these fears...

218
00:20:08,497 --> 00:20:10,200
after all these questions without answers.

219
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,300
And dreams without substance.

220
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,401
I journeyed home
One more mile...

221
00:20:17,473 --> 00:20:19,000
Just one last mile.

222
00:20:22,177 --> 00:20:24,475
...and there you were.

223
00:20:42,731 --> 00:20:46,724
Thank you, thank you... thank you very much.

224
00:20:46,802 --> 00:20:48,293
Well, are you sure you're ringing the right room?

225
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,000
He is with the New England poetry caravan...

226
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,665
I have been ringing Ma'am.
Would you like to leave a message?

227
00:20:54,743 --> 00:20:57,500
Uh, yeah... just tell him...
No, never mind. Just, no, thanks...

228
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,338
I'll just uh... try later.

229
00:21:06,588 --> 00:21:08,385
Well, he'd see it alright.

230
00:21:08,457 --> 00:21:12,052
He said: Bobbi... Cadillacs don't receed...

231
00:21:12,127 --> 00:21:15,995
we gotta find out where he's been and
what he's gotten into.

232
00:21:16,064 --> 00:21:20,899
Oh, buddy, I know where you've been.
I'll take a better look.

233
00:21:52,802 --> 00:21:54,000
Peter, come here.

234
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:59,329
Ok, listen. I don't want you going
with me...

235
00:21:59,408 --> 00:22:00,700
... cause I don't want you freaking out, alright?

236
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,100
So just go on back to the house. Go on!
Good boy!

237
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:35,237
What the hell are you?

238
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:05,230
My folks will kill me if they found out we were here.

239
00:23:05,307 --> 00:23:07,172
Who's gonna tell'em?

240
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:12,110
Gramps says this is where the Indians
used to pray to the gods.

241
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,800
- Give me a break!
- Really!

242
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,500
They believed this was a place of magic,

243
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,000
in between the spirit world and the real.

244
00:23:23,025 --> 00:23:24,822
Agghh... grose!

245
00:23:24,893 --> 00:23:27,487
Whaaa... what do you think killed it?

246
00:23:27,563 --> 00:23:30,498
probably ate some poisoned bait.

247
00:23:30,566 --> 00:23:34,000
Yeah, maybe it was sacrificed to the gods.

248
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,000
What?

249
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,000
Don't you hear it?

250
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:02,000
Gramp's was right.

251
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,193
- Hilly....
- Run, Barney!

252
00:24:11,173 --> 00:24:12,232
What are you kids doing here?

253
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You shouldn't be alone in the woods.

254
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,000
Let's go call your dad.
He can pick you up.

255
00:24:19,948 --> 00:24:21,000
A drink, sir?

256
00:24:21,351 --> 00:24:23,300
Uhh.. tonic water, please.

257
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I... think your poem was wonderful
tonight, Mr Gardener.

258
00:24:29,725 --> 00:24:31,000
Thank you very much, son.

259
00:24:32,127 --> 00:24:33,700
Hey, my friends call me Jim.

260
00:24:36,064 --> 00:24:38,000
- Thanks.
- Everything alright, Gardener?

261
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,500
Ah, Patricia, I didn't know you cared.

262
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:46,000
- Tonic water.
- I'm doubious.

263
00:24:46,441 --> 00:24:49,000
Yes, you always have, but what you
really are, though, Patty is a...

264 
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,076
little ticked off, aren't you?
I mean, I got the biggest hand of the day.

265
00:24:53,148 --> 00:24:54,500
I pay you to read new poetry.

266
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Not old stuff.

267
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,513
When's the last poem you wrote
that got published?

268
00:24:59,588 --> 00:25:02,113
When's the last poem you wrote that
was any good?

269
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,000
You may fool them... you don't fool me.

270
00:25:05,527 --> 00:25:07,000
You are nothing but a drunk, Gardener.

271
00:25:07,896 --> 00:25:09,200
Always were... always will be.

272
00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:22,000
Why don't we add some vodka to that?

273
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,700
Whatever you say, Mr. Gardener

274
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:30,943
I say... uh, second thoughts... hold the tonic.

275
00:25:43,498 --> 00:25:45,000
Hi, Pearl how are you?

276
00:25:45,434 --> 00:25:47,130
Hi sheriff! What can I do for you?

277
00:25:48,203 --> 00:25:50,500
Oh, well, just my usual wash and fluff.

278
00:25:51,306 --> 00:25:53,000
Don't listen to a word she says, Pearl.

279
00:25:53,806 --> 00:25:55,000
You gotta doll her all up.

280
00:25:55,977 --> 00:25:58,300
- She's got a big date and I do mean...
- Do you mind...please?

281
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,941
- Big!!
- Becka stop it!

282
00:26:01,016 --> 00:26:02,745
She's going to the movies with Butch.

283
00:26:02,818 --> 00:26:04,752
Tell the world why don't you?

284
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:09,689
You have to wear one of those kind of
outfits like Michelle Pfeiffer wears.

285
00:26:09,758 --> 00:26:11,420
Just the regular, Pearl, please?

286
00:26:12,494 --> 00:26:16,828
Oh.. Pearl, and you know what? Can you show her
some of that new polish and lipstick that you got?

287
00:26:16,898 --> 00:26:19,059
Yes, yes!

288
00:26:19,868 --> 00:26:21,000
Final Passion...

289
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,967
No... no..., thank you very much.
That's where I draw the line, girls.

290
00:26:29,878 --> 00:26:30,500
Ruth's right.

291
00:26:31,313 --> 00:26:34,000
We don't want our sheriff downtown
looking like a floozy.

292
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,500
Besides, I've just sold the last
set to the post mistress.

293
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Good! I'm glad to hear that!

294
00:26:41,423 --> 00:26:44,000
- Ladies...
- Hi, Nancy.

295
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
- Well, then... bye bye everyone.
- Bye, Nancy.

296
00:26:51,066 --> 00:26:53,091
- That was close....
- Yeah, yeah...

297
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,000
- Where have you been?
- Bobbi Anderson's woods, that's where.

298
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
- Not "Burning Wood"?
- Yeah.

299
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,500
After all that we told you about
not going in there?

300
00:27:03,445 --> 00:27:05,500
You were right, gramps, the woods are magic.

301
00:27:06,615 --> 00:27:08,106
Upstairs young man.

302
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:11,000
- Bad magic.
- Not another word!

303
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,300
Well... Ev Hillman, this looks like your fault.

304
00:27:19,961 --> 00:27:22,658
Boys are always jumping around
I was like them when I was his age!

305
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,293
If you're gonna live under my roof,
would you please live by my rules?

306
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:35,606
Ev...

307
00:27:40,00 --> 00:27:41,946
I'm sorry....

308
00:27:49,457 --> 00:27:50,947
Are you ok?

309
00:27:51,026 --> 00:27:53,961
I got a hell of a headache...

310
00:27:54,029 --> 00:27:56,497
I think something bit me up there...

311
00:27:56,565 --> 00:27:58,294
you know, when I was picking up Hilly...

312
00:27:58,366 --> 00:28:01,597
Well, there's a lot of flu,
Do you want me to call Doc Ward?

313
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:04,000
No... he'll just tell me to drink a lot of water...

314
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,330
and get plenty of rest. I'll be okay.

315
00:28:17,619 --> 00:28:21,783
What's his name again?
No, no... don't tell me, don't tell me

316
00:28:21,857 --> 00:28:24,985
It's that sound you make when you gargle.

317
00:28:27,896 --> 00:28:29,295
That's it, isn't it? Arglebargle?

318
00:28:29,364 --> 00:28:32,959
- Well... Arberg, actually.
- No, Arglebargle.

319
00:28:33,034 --> 00:28:35,764
It sounds so much better, don't you think?

320
00:28:35,837 --> 00:28:38,533
Mr. Arglebargle... hello.

321
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:45,504
- Maybe you'd better call it a night..
- Yess, sir, maybe... 

322
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,816
maybe you're right. Maybe I should
just go home...

323
00:28:48,884 --> 00:28:51,978
get a good night sleep and live
to write another day.
 
324
00:28:52,053 --> 00:28:54,214
To fight...

325
00:28:54,289 --> 00:28:56,120
...another day.

326
00:28:56,958 --> 00:29:00,257
God, the american people had finally got this true
noble business into perspective...

327
00:29:00,328 --> 00:29:02,762
so, we can go ahead with the new plant.

328
00:29:02,831 --> 00:29:05,129
26 deads... it's horrible...

329
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,100
but then, last month a plain crash killed a 195...

330
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,300
and you don't see the government shutting
down all the air lines, do you?

331
00:29:12,073 --> 00:29:16,700
At Chernobyl they killed kids, did you know that?

332
00:29:17,112 --> 00:29:21,139
uh... 9 year-olds... the ones "in utero".

333
00:29:21,216 --> 00:29:24,083
Isn't that right, Mr. Kilowatt?

334
00:29:28,256 --> 00:29:31,589
- I will fix you...
- Oh, Patricia!

335
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:36,427
Really? Oh, I've been waiting to be
fixed by you for years!

336
00:29:36,498 --> 00:29:40,491
Shall we maybe go upstairs, or just give
everybody a treat and do it right here on the rock, uh?

337
00:29:40,568 --> 00:29:44,334
I'm going to see to it that you
never work again, you...

338
00:29:44,406 --> 00:29:47,034
Drunkard, contemptious, worthless...

339
00:29:49,678 --> 00:29:51,270
Hey, you!

340
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,500
Caramba!! You... stupid ass!
Andale, andale, andale!!

341
00:30:11,566 --> 00:30:14,831
Stop! Somebody help me!

342
00:30:14,903 --> 00:30:20,364
Help you... help you... Is that all you can say,
Mr. Power Man?... Mr. Kilowatt?

343
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:24,176
You nuking SOB...

344
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,000
Hey... you gotta bag out of here,
ladies called the cops.

345
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,275
Yeah... oh God, I shouldn't have done that.

346
00:30:30,352 --> 00:30:31,286
- What? Hit him?

347
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,949
Nooo... Open the umbrella in the house
bad luck!

348
00:30:36,024 --> 00:30:37,958
- Good-bye, my friend.
- Good-bye, Sir.

349
00:30:40,762 --> 00:30:43,026
If... If you remember nothing else in this world...

350
00:30:43,098 --> 00:30:45,362
remember this...

351
00:30:45,433 --> 00:30:47,799
...God hates a coward.

352
00:31:39,721 --> 00:31:41,746
Oh... What have I...?

353
00:31:48,196 --> 00:31:51,222
What did I do this time?

354
00:31:55,036 --> 00:31:57,266
Bobbi!

355
00:32:12,887 --> 00:32:14,752
<i> Hey, thanks for the ride </i>

356
00:32:14,823 --> 00:32:17,121
Jack Kimball, my name. 

357
00:32:17,192 --> 00:32:19,160
Hi, Jack.

358
00:32:19,227 --> 00:32:21,161
I'm a salesman. Mr. Suck-it-up.

359
00:32:23,198 --> 00:32:25,000
Spare vacuum cleaner parts?

360
00:32:26,201 --> 00:32:28,500
Selling people the American dream, right?

361
00:32:29,871 --> 00:32:32,000
So, what's your name, what's your game, friend?

362
00:32:32,508 --> 00:32:38,172
Jim Gardener's the name, poetry's the game. 

363
00:32:40,582 --> 00:32:42,000
I've never met a poet before.

364
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,983
So, where if I might ask are you
headed, Mr. Poet?

365
00:32:47,055 --> 00:32:50,000
The place for when you have to go there they

366
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,500
have to take you in... home.

367
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:59,694
Oh... that's nice, that's very nice.

368
00:33:00,802 --> 00:33:04,500
There's a thermus and sack of
drunken doughnuts

369
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,000
in the back if you're hungry.

370
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,706
Thanks.

371
00:33:10,111 --> 00:33:13,569
Let's see if I can get some driving music.

372
00:33:13,915 --> 00:33:16,440
ahhh... damn!

373
00:33:18,219 --> 00:33:21,000
- What the hell was that?
- That was me...

374
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Do you see this?

375
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,500
Yeah, you were in a fight?

376
00:33:26,761 --> 00:33:30,595
Yeah... with a giant pine.

377
00:33:30,665 --> 00:33:32,000
Well, how did that happen?

378
00:33:32,901 --> 00:33:34,500
It was trying to impress this pretty

379
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,596
young thing on the slopes when I was 17.

380
00:33:38,673 --> 00:33:39,500
When I woke up,

381
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,039
they had filled my head with a steel plate.

382
00:33:43,111 --> 00:33:45,500
They told me I'd get headaches from time to time.

383
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,100
Headaches? My God! You are lucky to be alive.

384
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,048
Yeah, that's what they said.
What they didn't say...

385
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,000
...was that every now and then

386
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:56,723
I was gonna pick up a microwave issue
or a radio transmission.

387
00:33:56,791 --> 00:34:00,090
Oh, man! That is really something.

388
00:34:00,161 --> 00:34:02,129
Your are the first guy I've met
that can make a trick like that.

389
00:34:03,998 --> 00:34:05,932
Some trick.

390
00:34:30,525 --> 00:34:34,962
Hilly, wake up!.
There is a monster in my closet!

391
00:35:07,795 --> 00:35:10,320
Some monster...

392
00:35:18,206 --> 00:35:22,000
- Can I sleep in your bed tonight?
- Sure.

393
00:35:22,877 --> 00:35:25,200
Back we go, all warm and safe and toasty.

394
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:31,000
I saw it... the Tommyknocker...

395
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,000
It's only a nursery rhyme, Davey.

396
00:35:35,556 --> 00:35:39,117
Back when I was little, my friends
used to tease about them too.

397
00:35:39,193 --> 00:35:40,100
Good night.

398
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:55,373
No nuts?

399
00:35:57,445 --> 00:35:58,000
You look real nice.

400
00:35:58,747 --> 00:36:02,000
- Thanks. So do you.
- Thanks

401
00:36:03,017 --> 00:36:05,600
- I liked the movie.
- Yeah, me too.

402
00:36:08,122 --> 00:36:10,022
Can I ask you something, Ruthie?

403
00:36:10,091 --> 00:36:11,000
I will answer if I can.

404
00:36:12,193 --> 00:36:16,152
After Ralph died, why did you stay in Haven?

405
00:36:20,402 --> 00:36:24,133
Well... to start with... I don't like cities so much...

406
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:33,477
and then... after a while the land cast a spell,
kinda gets to you.

407
00:36:37,251 --> 00:36:39,185
So, let me ask you a question.

408
00:36:39,253 --> 00:36:40,100
Name it.

409
00:36:41,622 --> 00:36:43,556
How come you never got married?

410
00:36:43,624 --> 00:36:49,221
Me? What woman would marry
a big log like me?

411
00:36:50,732 --> 00:36:52,893
Lot of women.

412
00:36:53,868 --> 00:36:56,632
Yeah, as a matter of fact...

413
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,000
What?

414
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:09,581
Uh... nothing... I was thinking I have
to get up early. Let's go, ok?

415
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:10,481
Sure.

416
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:36,639
Joe!!!
Joseph Paulson you come back here this instant!

417
00:37:36,711 --> 00:37:38,700
You oughtta be ashamed, don't you forget something?

418
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
No, what...? I'm sorry honey.

419
00:37:41,516 --> 00:37:43,575
You better be!

420
00:37:47,889 --> 00:37:49,000
Your sandwiches...

421
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,700
...for you and the boys... for your fishing trip.

422
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,821
Oh...really... this is great. Thanks a lot, honey.

423
00:37:55,897 --> 00:37:58,297
Bye, I'll see you tonight ok?

424
00:38:23,825 --> 00:38:25,192
She bought the fishing story?

425
00:38:27,261 --> 00:38:28,700
Hook, line and sinker.

426
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,000
Good, then hop on in and let's see
what we can catch.

427
00:38:37,205 --> 00:38:40,174
Hop on in and let's see what we can catch
hahahahaha...

428
00:38:45,746 --> 00:38:50,410
The magic guillotine, behold its sharpness.

429
00:38:52,386 --> 00:38:53,876
Observe.

430
00:38:57,058 --> 00:38:59,000
I need a volunteer from the audience.

431
00:39:00,995 --> 00:39:03,964
- You, Barney Applegate.
- Me?

432
00:39:06,767 --> 00:39:08,700
I hope you know what you're doing...

433
00:39:09,905 --> 00:39:12,169
Now, just put your finger in here.

434
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:23,577
Thank you... thanks.

435
00:39:26,254 --> 00:39:29,000
Ok, now I need a volunteer for my next trick.

436
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,000
Mr. Allison.

437
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,225
Me? I don't think so.

438
00:39:36,297 --> 00:39:38,458
Come on Mr. A, be a sport.

439
00:39:38,533 --> 00:39:42,264
Okay, I'll do it.... Just make it fast, Hilly.

440
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,668
And now... the white and black rabbit trick!

441
00:39:44,739 --> 00:39:47,173
First, it's white...

442
00:39:53,581 --> 00:39:55,811
Now...please take off the top, sir.

443
00:40:10,798 --> 00:40:14,029
I'm sorry, Mr. Allison.
Just give me another chance...

444
00:40:14,101 --> 00:40:17,093
I can do the multiplying queen trick.

445
00:40:30,751 --> 00:40:32,878
Thanks for the ride.

446
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,708
Pete... Petey!

447
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,000
How you doing? How are you?
Come here!

448
00:41:04,418 --> 00:41:06,613
You're good.

449
00:41:06,687 --> 00:41:08,348
Where's Bobbi? okay, okay!
Where is she?

450
00:41:13,564 --> 00:41:18,896
Bob! Bobbi?

451
00:41:21,602 --> 00:41:24,036
God... I'm so glad you're back!

452
00:41:26,474 --> 00:41:28,305
Wait to see it...

453
00:41:29,977 --> 00:41:33,208
It should've been you, Gard... It should've been you
who found it.

454
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,000
Found what?

455
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:36,700
I think that it was for you.

456
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,000
What? What was?

457
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:42,681
Well... you will understand it when you see it.

458
00:41:42,757 --> 00:41:44,500
- And you feel it...
- Hey...hey...

459
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,727
What do you want?

460
00:41:49,263 --> 00:41:51,527
Euphoria.

461
00:41:53,034 --> 00:41:55,400
A miracle.

462
00:41:55,469 --> 00:41:57,000
At first I just thought it was a car, you know...

463
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,100
I mean, like that time we found that Hudson...

464
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:05,539
I mean, I could have walked past this thing three times 
a day for 40 years and never stumble over it!!

465
00:42:05,613 --> 00:42:06,807
- Are you alright?
- Yeah... but...

466
00:42:06,881 --> 00:42:10,408
Please slow... down a little bit.

467
00:42:10,484 --> 00:42:12,384
I... yeah...okay, yes, I'm rambling, I know.

468
00:42:12,453 --> 00:42:15,388
I haven't slept and I guess I need
some food too, but I'm telling you, Gard,

469
00:42:15,456 --> 00:42:20,000
I just... it makes me feel different and
I... have all this energy... and...

470
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,361
and...I've got ideas and... well...

471
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:26,958
and you're telling me you think this thing
in the ground is making you feel this way.

472
00:42:27,034 --> 00:42:29,798
It has affected Pete, too... I mean, yeah, yeah

473
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:33,102
His eye is better, the catarat is... is... 
disappearing...

474
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,000
Please, honey.

475
00:42:36,644 --> 00:42:39,078
Tell me what's going on here?

476
00:42:40,948 --> 00:42:43,041
Well... no, I have to show you.

477
00:42:45,053 --> 00:42:49,318
Just wait till you see it, Gard! 
you are not going to believe it!

478
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,000
Oh!... You okay?

479
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,000
Here it is...

480
00:43:03,738 --> 00:43:05,600
It's the most incredible thing I've ever seen!

481
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,200
It's really something, isn't it?

482
00:43:12,714 --> 00:43:15,000
What the hell is this?

483
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I don't know... hahaha...

484
00:43:18,953 --> 00:43:21,013
Oh... I wanna show you something else...

485
00:43:25,826 --> 00:43:27,157
Watch this!

486
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,700
Touch it.

487
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,400
What?

488
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,000
Touch it.

489
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,200
Oh, come on, it's not gonna bite you!

490
00:44:08,703 --> 00:44:11,671
- Bobbi...
- What's the matter?

491
00:44:13,841 --> 00:44:15,000
Gard... Gard...!

492
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,000
Oh, God!
Oh... Gard!

493
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,163
I'm bleeding. It stopped, I think ...

494
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,068
Oh... Gard... you scared me to death...

495
00:44:47,141 --> 00:44:48,000
I'm okay...

496
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,000
What happened? What was it?

497
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:55,371
I don't know, you saw it... I touched that thing
and I felt like my head was gonna explode...

498
00:44:55,449 --> 00:44:58,043
It's like the DTs.

499
00:44:59,019 --> 00:45:02,079
I just can't believe that that thing
could do this to you.

500
00:45:02,156 --> 00:45:05,216
Yeah...well... maybe it didn't.

501
00:45:07,895 --> 00:45:10,700
I haven't been too good for the last
couple of days, you know...

502
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,000
No... I... I don't know.

503
00:45:13,501 --> 00:45:18,800
Well, you know, I was... I was away over there
and I got... I got this really bad feeling

504
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,000
that you were in trouble and I...

505
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,000
Is that why you came back early?

506
00:45:27,248 --> 00:45:28,700
My hero.

507
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,000
Some hero!

508
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:34,749
I fell off the wagon, Bobbi.

509
00:45:36,023 --> 00:45:37,200
What?

510
00:45:38,158 --> 00:45:40,422
Yeah... sorry...

511
00:45:40,494 --> 00:45:42,300
Sorry? just... like that?

512
00:45:43,862 --> 00:45:47,000
Well...after everything we've been through
and everything we worked for...

513
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,500
You're sorry?

514
00:45:49,737 --> 00:45:52,000
I don't know what happened...
I had this success thing and...

515
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,737
you weren't there to share it with me...

516
00:45:53,807 --> 00:45:55,741
and I just haven't...

517
00:45:59,013 --> 00:46:01,000
Come on, say something.

518
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,000
You go to hell!

519
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,708
Hey, Tweetie... Here you are...

520
00:46:57,805 --> 00:46:59,830
Okay if I come in?

521
00:47:10,584 --> 00:47:13,100
Didn't go so good at school today, uh?

522
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,700
- They all laughed...
- So?

523
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,000
They laughed at Columbus, too.

524
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,427
- Who cares what they think?
- I do!

525
00:47:21,495 --> 00:47:24,500
I practiced so hard!
I wanted it to be perfect!

526
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,667
Of course, you do, kiddo!

527
00:47:27,735 --> 00:47:30,533
You've just got... cat whiskers for nerves...

528
00:47:30,604 --> 00:47:33,000
But all artists and smart guys do.

529
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,508
but the trick is... to get back up on the horse

530
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,600
and show'em who's boss!

531
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,573
You mean, like... you know, like...
starting again?

532
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:46,141
Yeah... That's what makes the difference
between winners and losers.

533
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:52,424
Try again!

534
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:13,104
Bobbi, could you just listen to me
for a minute?

535
00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:17,840
I couldn't help it.

536
00:48:25,726 --> 00:48:27,092
That's a lie...

537
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,959
...I didn't even try!

538
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,368
I just drank.

539
00:48:37,271 --> 00:48:41,207
I got all this applause at this... old, old poem!

540
00:48:41,275 --> 00:48:43,334
I mean, let's be real here!

541
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:47,369
I haven't written anything worth
crap in years!

542
00:48:48,449 --> 00:48:49,939
Years!

543
00:48:57,091 --> 00:48:59,000
I am a fraud, Bobbi...

544
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,000
maybe I always have been...

545
00:49:02,429 --> 00:49:06,456
I know I don't deserve your
forgiveness, but I'm sorry...

546
00:49:11,138 --> 00:49:14,000
You are the only one whose love
still matters to me, you know...

547
00:49:18,545 --> 00:49:21,844
I don't know what I'd do if
you stopped loving me, Bobbi.

548
00:49:27,454 --> 00:49:30,548
Don't you know by now that I will
always love ya.

549
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:06,000
Yeah... I get it.

550
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:13,128
- Hilly...? Hilly?
Who are you talking to?

551
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,431
So I take those things and it'll work?

552
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,447
<i > Hi, I'm Chaz Steward, and welcome
again to He-Devil...

553
00:50:30,517 --> 00:50:32,712
where our three lovely ladies in just
a moment are gonna fight

554
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,619
for a night of breath taking romance...

555
00:50:35,689 --> 00:50:38,852
...with our one hunk of a stud
over here, Larry.

556
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:51,962
Here, here... Hey! Look!
Carefully... Watch out!

557
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:55,000
- You almost you made me hit my car!
- What?

558
00:50:56,978 --> 00:50:59,240
No no no, I gotta go, I gotta go!

559
00:50:59,313 --> 00:51:01,247
Becka is expecting me, I gotta go...

560
00:51:01,281 --> 00:51:03,181
- Oh, c'mon, Joey, it's our tender hour...

561
00:51:07,255 --> 00:51:10,849
- I gotta go, I gotta go...
- Go on then... Run home to wifey...

562
00:51:14,761 --> 00:51:16,285
Come on!.

563
00:51:43,857 --> 00:51:46,121
There is something, in the woods.

564
00:51:46,193 --> 00:51:48,184
Maybe it's the big wolf!

565
00:51:48,262 --> 00:51:50,287
No, really, there is something!

566
00:51:50,364 --> 00:51:53,561
It's just an "aminal", Joe!
It's an "aminal"!

567
00:51:53,634 --> 00:51:55,568
It's just an "aminal"!

568
00:52:03,644 --> 00:52:05,271
Let us out of here!

569
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:07,974
Go!

570
00:52:28,769 --> 00:52:30,669
I want you to go home now, Joe.

571
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Becka... honey... um, do I have any
clean shirts that's ironed?

572
00:52:54,628 --> 00:52:57,000
Why didn't you wake me up
when you came home last night?

573
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,697
Well... thought it was very late and..

574
00:53:00,767 --> 00:53:03,500
And it was very late
and you were sleeping...

575
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,400
- ...and I didn't wanna wake you up.
- Yeah, but you know... 

576
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,500
you should have called me or something,
I was awfully worried!

577
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,100
Honey, I'm in the middle of the woods,
how am I gonna phone you?

578
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:15,908
Well..., you know, I cooked your
favorite meal last night
- Oh... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

579
00:53:15,982 --> 00:53:19,440
And I got on that nightgown that 
you really like a lot and I...

580
00:53:21,188 --> 00:53:22,100
Oh, I'm sorry.

581
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,200
- Where is the fish?
- What fish?

582
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,700
- You know, the fish.
- The fish... honey, I'm a lousy fisherman,
and the fishing was lousy.

583
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:32,100
And do I have ironed shirts?
You were supposed to do'em yesterday.

584
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:36,057
- Yeah... I put them right in the drawer.
- Honey, they are not in the drawer.

585
00:53:36,136 --> 00:53:39,970
Come on, all I'm asking is that you
give me one shirt that's ironed.

586
00:53:51,151 --> 00:53:52,142
Gramps.

587
00:53:55,088 --> 00:53:57,056
What is it kiddo? what's wrong?

588
00:53:57,124 --> 00:54:00,184
I need your help, I need some batteries.

589
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:02,700
- Batteries?
- Yeah, and other stuff too.

590
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:05,562
- I've got a list.
- What's this all about?

591
00:54:05,632 --> 00:54:09,227
I've come up with a new trick, I can
do it on my birthday party on Saturday.

592
00:54:09,302 --> 00:54:11,800
A new one, uh? Is it a good trick?

593
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,000
Not good...great!

594
00:54:14,207 --> 00:54:16,400
The best trick anyone's ever seen.

595
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,000
It'll make'em gasp and scream and yell.

596
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,000
A trick that'll be remembered forever!

597
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,500
- Heyyy Petey!.
- About time!

598
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,000
You've been up long?

599
00:54:28,989 --> 00:54:30,000
- Hours!
- Really?

600
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,587
Breakfast is almost ready.

601
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,700
You need to shave.

602
00:54:38,131 --> 00:54:42,329
Yeah, well... I would trade my soul
in for a long hot shower and the plus'

603
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,500
- You would?
- Mm-mm

604
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
- Well... hand it over then...
- Wait a minute... 

605
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,707
you didn't call a plumber, did you?
We talked about this.

606
00:54:51,778 --> 00:54:55,000
I didn't call a plumber, I did it myself
while you were gone.

607
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,109
Hey, Pete... Miss Home Improvement, uh?

608
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,945
Oh, ye of little faith!

609
00:55:32,686 --> 00:55:34,017
What?

610
00:56:26,106 --> 00:56:28,097
What the hell...?

611
00:56:43,256 --> 00:56:45,224
What's the trick, Bobbi?

612
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Uh.. It... It... there is no trick...

613
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:53,000
It all just... uh, kinda came to me.

614
00:56:54,302 --> 00:56:56,000
I heard a voice telling me...

615
00:56:56,337 --> 00:56:59,931
that I could do something about
the hot water here.

616
00:57:00,006 --> 00:57:02,200
And next thing I knew it was done.

617
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,500
Wait a minute... Let me get this straight...

618
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:09,675
- You're telling me that... that thing
out there is talking to you?
- Mm-mm

619
00:57:10,985 --> 00:57:16,800
yeah... as I uncover it, it's sending out
some kind of transmission.

620
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,288
And turned you into an Einstein, uh?

621
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:21,500
Well, no, not Einstein exactly...

622
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:25,000
'cause Einstein knew things
and I don't know anything.

623
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,763
I just...

624
00:57:26,833 --> 00:57:30,064
I mean, I had no idea how I got
the hot water heater to work.

625
00:57:30,136 --> 00:57:33,000
I just knew as I was doing it

626
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:35,200
and everything seemed clear as a bell.

627
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,100
Look, I don't know what that thing is...

628
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:42,144
I just know that we have to dig it up.

629
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:47,010
Gard, there's something miraculous about it.

630
00:57:51,091 --> 00:57:53,559
Let's experience it together.

631
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,000
It really oughtta patent it!

632
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:05,000
Heeey.. What...what is this?

633
00:58:05,805 --> 00:58:07,000
My invention.

634
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,000
Wooww... What does it do?

635
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:14,200
Sorts the first class mail... Watch this!
- Come on! Are you...?

636
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,482
Look at this little flag! I love it!

637
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:20,018
Woooww... you gotta be kidding me!

638
00:58:20,086 --> 00:58:22,000
RFD1, Dairy road!

639
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,100
This is too much, how did you think of this?

640
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,200
Just came to me. Smart, uh?

641
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:29,500
Well, not bad, not for a woman,
is not bad at all!

642
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:32,723
Oh, you were complaining last night,
now, were you?

643
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,200
Woaa... last night we were going at each
other like bunnies.

644
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,162
And the sky was lighting up
like New Year's Eve.

645
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,898
No, I wasn't complaining at all.

646
00:58:38,972 --> 00:58:40,000
What was that thing?

647
00:58:40,608 --> 00:58:43,400
Oh... who the hell knows?
We were both crapped.

648
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,505
Mm-mm, we sure were, weren't we?

649
00:58:46,579 --> 00:58:47,568
You wanna do it again?

650
00:58:47,647 --> 00:58:49,581
- Do I?
- Do you?

651
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,142
Oh, boy!! Howdy do I!!

652
00:59:01,394 --> 00:59:02,884
Here, this too.

653
00:59:05,999 --> 00:59:09,230
What are you digging up
on that farm o'yours?

654
00:59:09,302 --> 00:59:12,430
There're are some stumps in the
back that need clearing...

655
00:59:12,505 --> 00:59:16,200
Well, if you dig up any buried treasure
save some for me.

656
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:19,100
I wouldn't mind being a lady of leisure,
I can tell you that.

657
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:23,976
Hey, there you two.
Hilly needs more batteries.

658
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:26,518
Then you try the mall over Augusta.

659
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:30,783
I'm cleaned out! They are really 
run on'em lately.

660
00:59:30,857 --> 00:59:32,791
Seems like everybody wants'em.

661
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,100
...alright now, before we hear from
our He-Devil

662
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:43,400
 who is patiently standing by,
I want you to tell our viewers

663
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:47,200
each one of you, exactly what it is
that you like in a men.

664
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,000
And we're starting right here with Wendy,
What do you like in a man?

665
00:59:50,577 --> 00:59:54,035
When they made a man like you,
Chaz Steward, they broke the mold...

666
00:59:54,114 --> 00:59:57,500
what are you doing tonight?
- Well, Gosh, I'm kind of busy, otherwise...

667
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:01,787
Girls, how would our He-Devil 
answer this question?

668
01:00:01,855 --> 01:00:05,018
<i > Sex is good, but (... ) is better.

669
01:00:06,392 --> 01:00:08,189
Joe?

670
01:00:08,261 --> 01:00:10,491
Fishing... fishing is better.

671
01:00:10,563 --> 01:00:12,500
Do you still love me, Joe?

672
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:15,200
What is this?
I mean... what? Do I still what...?

673
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,135
What kind of a dim bold question
is that, anyway?

674
01:00:21,908 --> 01:00:25,469
It's just lately you don't seem to show it.

675
01:00:26,546 --> 01:00:28,946
I don't believe you, I really don't... 

676
01:00:32,152 --> 01:00:34,450
Tell me the truth, Joe.

677
01:00:36,756 --> 01:00:37,600
No! you're crazy!

678
01:00:39,926 --> 01:00:42,417
I'm sorry, honey... I'm not... Geez!

679
01:00:45,098 --> 01:00:48,400
Why are you so mean to me?
What changed you like this?

680
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,800
I have nothing, I'm just the same
as I always was!

681
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,000
Where are my keys?

682
01:00:53,339 --> 01:00:54,800
Where are you going?

683
01:00:55,175 --> 01:00:57,000
How dare you ask me that question?

684
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:00,371
I'm going out now and I'll be back when
I want to, you got it?

685
01:01:00,446 --> 01:01:02,000
- But, Joe...
- You got it?
 
686
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,000
- But Joe...!
- Do you got it?

687
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,543
- But Joe!!!
- But, but, but, but...!

688
01:01:06,619 --> 01:01:08,800
See, I never wanna hear that word again,
I never wanna hear "but" again because

689
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:11,500
"but" is what a goat has for brains.

690
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:15,154
and "but" is for the small minded people,
in this small minded town.

691
01:01:15,228 --> 01:01:16,820
Bye!

692
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:23,800
And "but" is what you say

693
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:26,696
when you want to get away
from your stupid wife!

694
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:35,772
<i> Oh, he must think you were born yesterday,
born yesterday to believe such bull! </i>

695
01:01:35,849 --> 01:01:39,700
Listen, Becka!... Joe... he's been cheating on you!

696
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:43,680
It must be heat stoke, I'd better
call the infirmary.

697
01:01:43,756 --> 01:01:48,284
Naaa.. Calm down, Becka, chill out... 
let's not have a heart attack over this.

698
01:01:48,361 --> 01:01:50,454
Okay, Chaz...

699
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:54,000
Listen, one thing you gotta get straight:
you are not going crazy.

700
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,600
TV's don't talk...

701
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,800
Well, Becka, it appears that this one does.

702
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,000
And besides, we got a lot to talk about.

703
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:04,933
About Joe, for one thing, and his infidelities...
- He's having an affair...

704
01:02:05,011 --> 01:02:09,100
You got it! I mean, he's been pumping to
that hussy down at the post office just about

705
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,500
every lunch hour and around quitting time too.

706
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,300
Oh... what am I gonna do?

707
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:17,000
What are you gonna do?
Hey, why don't we ask our contestants? 

708
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,000
Okay, ladies, I want you put
yourselves in Becka's shoes.

709
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,300
What would you do?

710
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:26,054
- Kill him.
- Kill him.
- Kill him.

711
01:02:28,301 --> 01:02:31,566
Well, there you have it, Becka...
It's unanimous.

712
01:02:32,705 --> 01:02:34,036
Kill him?

713
01:02:42,715 --> 01:02:44,842
Isn't this... something?

714
01:02:47,086 --> 01:02:48,500
What-a-big it is!

715
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,300
What-a-what it is?

716
01:02:52,859 --> 01:02:56,351
Maybe it's an ancient temple from
another civilization.

717
01:02:56,429 --> 01:02:59,796
Or a... you know, piece of the Mayan trea--.
Hey!

718
01:02:59,866 --> 01:03:02,130
Maybe it's the Atlantis.

719
01:03:02,201 --> 01:03:06,069
Hell! Pete is an indication that could
be the fountain of youth.

720
01:03:07,874 --> 01:03:10,200
Bobbi, you think maybe we should
tell somebody about this?

721
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:12,267
Somebody? Who?

722
01:03:12,345 --> 01:03:15,678
I don't know! Maybe we should just uh... tell--

723
01:03:19,319 --> 01:03:21,514
...maybe we should tell the authorities, ok?

724
01:03:21,587 --> 01:03:23,919
Oh, no.. no!

725
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,388
All right, Ruth Merrill, then.

726
01:03:26,459 --> 01:03:28,100
Why? Because she's my friend?

727
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,987
She is a cop, Gard, she'd go to the Feds.

728
01:03:31,064 --> 01:03:33,123
Well, would that be so bad?

729
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:36,300
Gard what are you talking about?
I mean, how can you say that?

730
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:39,000
You think our government will be
completely satisfied...

731
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:42,169
until we have a glow in the dark?

732
01:03:42,241 --> 01:03:45,972
I mean, I found this amazing thing
and you want me to through it over to them?

733
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,581
Gard, they will come here with trucks...

734
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:53,551
filled with wire and men with guns.

735
01:03:53,619 --> 01:03:55,700
They'll gag us, Gard!

736
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,955
And you know that they would do it.

737
01:03:58,024 --> 01:04:01,084
You really do hold for it, you know
that, don't you?

738
01:04:02,195 --> 01:04:05,221
I learned from the master.

739
01:04:08,201 --> 01:04:10,965
Okay... okay!

740
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:17,742
Okay? So, until we know what this is
we'll just keep it between us, alright?

741
01:04:18,811 --> 01:04:20,711
Not a word to anybody.

742
01:05:01,354 --> 01:05:03,000
Good afternoon, Bobbi.
What can I do for you?

743
01:05:03,723 --> 01:05:06,658
Yeah, I've got a piece of registered mail.

744
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,700
Joe, you got that package
for Anderson back there?

745
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,800
<i> Oh, God! He's so hot, I can't stand it </i>.

746
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,104
Excuse me?

747
01:05:19,672 --> 01:05:21,100
I didn't say anything.

748
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,200
- Here you go, Bobbi.
- Hi, Joe. Thanks.

749
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:31,200
<i> Ah, Geez, look at his hair.</i>

750
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:34,700
<i> I haven't been this horny
since I was 16.</i>

751
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:39,500
<i> Last thing I need is his wife knowing
what we're up to. </i>

752
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:41,700
Is there anything else?

753
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,229
Give my regards to Becka.

754
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,100
Gard, I'm telling you, I could read
their minds!

755
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,800
Sense that they're having an affair maybe...

756
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
but, come on, read their minds?

757
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,087
- Yeah!
- Well, you're very intuitive, you always
know what the hell I'm gonna say next...

758
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,600
Yeah... you are probably right.

759
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:16,100
I know I'm right.

760
01:06:18,831 --> 01:06:22,460
I know I'm tired, and that we
should go to bed.

761
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:29,139
Naaa... I'm not really tired, I just..
wanna write a little bit.

762
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:37,000
I hope you have better luck tonight.

763
01:06:38,184 --> 01:06:40,277
Don't stay up too late.

764
01:06:57,537 --> 01:06:59,198
What you doing, Hill?

765
01:06:59,272 --> 01:07:02,500
- Out! I gotta get ready for the show!
- But... Hilly!

766
01:07:03,543 --> 01:07:05,800
The Medici Princes used to have
people executed...

767
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:08,438
...if they were caught looking at
the tricks ahead of time.

768
01:07:08,514 --> 01:07:09,000
Now... out!

769
01:07:10,716 --> 01:07:12,547

770
01:07:17,089 --> 01:07:18,852
Ladies and gentlemen...

771
01:07:18,925 --> 01:07:21,951
my grandson has a surprise for all of you.

772
01:07:22,028 --> 01:07:27,125
A magical treat of his own,
I repeat, of his own devicing!

773
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,135
I give you... Hillman, the magnificent!

774
01:07:35,141 --> 01:07:36,500
Ladies and gentlemen...

775
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:39,200
for my first trick, I want you
to watch closely...

776
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:42,138
... as the mysteries of the Orient take ahold.

777
01:07:48,521 --> 01:07:51,149
Prest-o change-o, the disappearing tomato!

778
01:08:01,234 --> 01:08:04,101
Prest-o change-o, return!

779
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,500
That's my radio...

780
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:17,000
Now... for the disappearing radio...

781
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:32,000
Prest-o change-o, return!

782
01:08:39,405 --> 01:08:41,930
It's time for the grand finale!

783
01:08:42,509 --> 01:08:44,943
The disappearing... human.

784
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:48,600
Now, I need an assistant...
Barney Applegate?

785
01:08:50,016 --> 01:08:51,700
No way man... Forget it!

786
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:56,000
- Come here, Davey.
- Don't want to!

787
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,100
Do what I say...

788
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,724
It's okay, Davey, go ahead.

789
01:09:04,263 --> 01:09:07,699
- But Hilly, I am scared.
- Do it and I'll give you anything!

790
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:09,700
All your GI Joe's?

791
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:12,000
Every one! Just get up here now.

792
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:30,000
- Hilly...!
- Off you go, know that you can...

793
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:33,118
'cause I learned this trick
from the Tommyknocker man.

794
01:09:40,866 --> 01:09:43,801
Prest-o... Majest-o... disappear!

795
01:09:55,681 --> 01:09:57,000
No... wait, wait, wait. I'm not done!

796
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,814
Enough, Hilly, get your brother
and come on in to open the presents.

797
01:10:00,886 --> 01:10:02,100
His not under here.. damn it!

798
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:05,546
Hilly, don't swear... get your brother
out of there and come on in

799
01:10:05,624 --> 01:10:07,300
we'll open your presents.

800
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Prest-o change-o, return...
Prest-o change-o, return!

801
01:10:18,704 --> 01:10:21,832
Please God... I'm sorry...

802
01:10:21,907 --> 01:10:23,100
He can have all my GI Joe's....

803
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:26,537
Anything! I swear it!
Just let him come back!

804
01:10:26,612 --> 01:10:28,000
What's wrong, son?

805
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:31,044
I'll do anything... just bring him back!
Bring him back now!

806
01:10:31,117 --> 01:10:33,100
What does he mean?
Who is he talking to?

807
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:34,186
I don't know.

808
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:38,900
Hilly! You stop fooling around
and get Davey back! Now!

809
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I'm trying but I can't!
I try, okay!?

810
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:43,100
Okay, where is he, honey?
Where did Davey go?

811
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:47,856
I don't know!  I don't know where things go
when they stop being here...!

812
01:10:55,741 --> 01:10:58,107
Come back, Davey, come back!

813
01:11:16,629 --> 01:11:18,563
I'm sure there's a logical explanation, Ev.

814
01:11:21,467 --> 01:11:23,492
Probably, he sleeps somewhere in the grass.

815
01:11:24,703 --> 01:11:28,901
- Without any of us seeing it?
- He would never have gone
all by himself... never....

816
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,700
Honey, you know little boys, okay?
I mean...

817
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,800
He's been gone one hour, I'm
sure he's gonna turn up.

818
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,100
You've got to find him before dark.

819
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,000
You've got to!

820
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:47,000
Hilly... How did you think up this trick?

821
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:51,100
The voices... they told me what to do
and how to do it.

822
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,300
What voices?

823
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,793
I don't know... I don't know!

824
01:11:55,868 --> 01:11:58,837
- Take it easy, son.
- This is all your fault!

825
01:11:58,904 --> 01:12:02,200
I wish you'd never given me that
stupid magic set in the first place!

826
01:12:03,008 --> 01:12:06,000
- No Hilly, you don't mean that.
- Yes I do!

827
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:09,112
I hate magic and I hate him!

828
01:12:12,318 --> 01:12:15,014
All right everybody, listen up!

829
01:12:15,087 --> 01:12:18,215
We're gonna search this town
from top to bottom.

830
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:20,200
First I want you to divide into groups.

831
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:22,500
One group go up and down Main Street...

832
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:25,000
I want you to check every building,
store and house...

833
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,657
...and don't forget to knock on every door.

834
01:12:27,733 --> 01:12:30,099
Now, Ev, Gard, Bobbi... you 
come with Butch and me.

835
01:12:30,169 --> 01:12:33,200
We'll search "Burning Woods".
I've got a little boy lost here today...

836
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:36,000
and I wanna find him before nightfall.

837
01:12:39,245 --> 01:12:42,214
Well... what you're all looking at?
Come on! Let's go find him!

838
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:46,000
I'm sure we'll find him, Ev.

839
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Oh, yeah? How do you know he's lost?

840
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I guess I know how you must feel but...

841
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:57,025
No, no... You don't know I feel.

842
01:13:39,838 --> 01:13:42,800
It's you, Petey. It's just me!

843
01:13:43,842 --> 01:13:45,275
Peter, no! Down!!

844
01:13:48,681 --> 01:13:50,000
Oh, Ruth, I'm sorry.

845
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:53,143
What the hell is the matter with him, Bobbi?

846
01:13:53,218 --> 01:13:55,000
I don't know, he's been acting
really weird lately...

847
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:58,000
Well, he's acting like a regular Cujo!

848
01:13:58,992 --> 01:14:02,000
- What? What? What do you hear?
- I heard something over there.

849
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:03,190
All right.

850
01:14:06,665 --> 01:14:08,000
That was close!

851
01:14:20,346 --> 01:14:21,500
Missing Child Hotline.

852
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,100
No, father, no sign of the poor little lamb.

853
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:30,200
He's... he's abducted, right?

854
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,855
I'm afraid so. There's no rational explanation.

855
01:14:34,927 --> 01:14:38,600
He could not have gotten past the search
area without being taken by somebody.

856
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:41,000
We've got an APB out, somebody'll spot him.

857
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,198
But... your men will keep
looking for him, won't they?

858
01:14:44,269 --> 01:14:45,500
Sure, Ev.

859
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:48,000
Well, we'll start again at first light.

860
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,000
You just can't leave him out there
all by himself all night!

861
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:54,678
- Yeah, what do you mean "at first light"?
- Brian, what are we gonna do?

862
01:14:54,747 --> 01:14:57,375
Oh, honey, let's just let'em do their job.

863
01:14:57,449 --> 01:14:59,110
We'll find him, Marie.

864
01:14:59,184 --> 01:15:01,243
- Everything will be fine, just let'em do their job.
- I know we will.

865
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,800
Becka, you look exhausted.

866
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,700
Why don't you go on home
and take care of Joe?

867
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:19,500
What?

868
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:22,200
Oh, Joe left the search early,
said he was coming out with the flu.

869
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:23,800
I'll mend the phones.

870
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
I'll go see how he is.

871
01:15:28,881 --> 01:15:30,700
- I'll be back first thing in the morning.
- Okay.

872
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:32,714
Thanks, Becka.

873
01:15:39,625 --> 01:15:41,000
Missing Child Hotline.

874
01:15:47,299 --> 01:15:50,500
I tell you, that kid Davey, could be the
best thing that ever happened to us.

875
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:53,366
If we are lucky he could be missing for a week.

876
01:15:56,809 --> 01:15:57,700
What about Becka?

877
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:04,343
No, no, forget it. Forget it, Becka's gonna be manning
those phones day and night until they find him.

878
01:16:05,384 --> 01:16:08,012
Day and night.

879
01:16:08,087 --> 01:16:10,317
Night and day.

880
01:16:12,157 --> 01:16:14,955
Joe, are you alright? Joe?

881
01:16:32,711 --> 01:16:34,736
Final Passion.

882
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:39,311
<i> Ah, very good Becka, now, 
easy down there.

883
01:16:39,384 --> 01:16:43,582
<i> Yeah, that's right, now, that red wire.

884
01:16:43,655 --> 01:16:46,455
<i> No, no, not there... Yeah, there...

885
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:49,460
I'm just no good at this, I'm too clumpsy.

886
01:16:49,528 --> 01:16:53,897
Not a lot of welding, don't you feel sorry,
he's been a devil to you, Becka.

887
01:16:53,966 --> 01:16:56,594
What if there's some other explanation
for the lipstick?

888
01:16:56,668 --> 01:17:02,038


889
01:17:02,107 --> 01:17:03,267
What then?

890
01:17:03,342 --> 01:17:05,000
Then, I have to do something about it.

891
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,279
Yeah... and you are! You are.

892
01:17:29,067 --> 01:17:31,000
Any luck finding the boy?

893
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:36,163
Uh... man, we looked high and low
but there was just no sign of that kid.

894
01:17:38,410 --> 01:17:40,708
- Thou shall not suffer a liar.
- Uh?

895
01:17:45,050 --> 01:17:46,745
I said: that's too bad.

896
01:17:46,819 --> 01:17:50,653
Sorry, champ, I guess the odds
didn't pick you as their perfect date.

897
01:17:50,722 --> 01:17:55,000
Ah... would you turn this junk off?
I mean, I hate this show.

898
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:57,100
Turn it off yourself.

899
01:17:57,896 --> 01:17:58,900
What did you say to me?

900
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:04,100
I said you could damn well turn it
off yourself, if you so want it.

901
01:18:04,169 --> 01:18:07,138
What the hell is the matter with you
talking to me like that?

902
01:18:16,381 --> 01:18:19,111
That's it! Good night and good date.

903
01:20:51,236 --> 01:20:55,104
<i > "The Buffalo Soldiers"
A New Novel by Roberta Anderson.

904
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,911
<i> For Gard, my partner in the quest.

905
01:21:12,858 --> 01:21:15,258
Please come back...

906
01:21:15,327 --> 01:21:18,990
If you just come back, I'll give you
all my GI Joe's...

907
01:21:19,064 --> 01:21:22,693
Snake Eyes, Crystal Ball.

908
01:21:24,302 --> 01:21:25,929
Even the Terror Drome.

909
01:21:26,004 --> 01:21:28,438
Hilly! Help me!

910
01:21:28,507 --> 01:21:30,134
Davey?

911
01:21:30,208 --> 01:21:34,500
It's cold and dark and I wanna
come home, Hilly.

912
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:37,007
Where are you, Davey? Where are you?

913
01:21:37,082 --> 01:21:40,000
I'm with the Tommyknockers. Help me!

914
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,253
How? I don't know how.
Please, Davey...

915
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:57,891
Who are you talking to?

916
01:22:00,872 --> 01:22:03,033
Where is Davey?

917
01:22:03,108 --> 01:22:05,508
I don't know!

918
01:22:05,577 --> 01:22:09,343
I don't know where things go
when they stop being here.

919
01:22:09,414 --> 01:22:13,009
I never disappeared anything that was
alive before...

920
01:22:19,124 --> 01:22:21,115
Help me someone!

921
01:22:22,095 --> 01:22:25,000
- GI Joe's... GI Joe's...
- He's delirious... He was talking to Davey.

922
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:27,000
He said the Tommyknockers got him.

923
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:28,800
I'll take him into the hospital in Derry

924
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:31,702
No, no, no... You two stay here.
I'll take Hilly to the hospital,

925
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:35,206
I'll call you as soon as I spoke with
a doctor. And pray for us.

926
01:22:35,273 --> 01:22:38,208
You'll be okay... I'll get the door.

927
01:22:38,276 --> 01:22:40,210
Everything'll be okay, Hilly.

928
01:22:42,247 --> 01:22:45,410

929
01:22:45,484 --> 01:22:47,418
You'll be okay, honey...

930
01:23:14,079 --> 01:23:15,876
Well?

931
01:23:20,752 --> 01:23:23,152
Best thing you've ever written.

932
01:23:23,221 --> 01:23:26,520
Thanks. I think it is too.

933
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
So, when was this... uh.. done?

934
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:37,629
Last night... in my sleep.

935
01:23:38,770 --> 01:23:41,000
It's impossible...

936
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:44,265
Well, not with my word recorder, it ain't.

937
01:23:47,746 --> 01:23:52,237
Telepathic typewriter, uh?
God Bobbi!

938
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:59,000
What's it like this... feeling?

939
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:03,886
It's a high, it's an incredible high.

940
01:24:06,998 --> 01:24:09,100
What about you? You don't fell anything?

941
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:15,272
Nothing, not a jot, not an ounce
of poetic inspiration...

942
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:17,035
Nothing.

943
01:24:20,512 --> 01:24:24,100
You will, it just doesn't happen all at once.

944
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:26,500
I suppose you're right.

945
01:24:27,285 --> 01:24:31,381
Maybe it's the old plate in my head, uh?

946
01:24:34,359 --> 01:24:35,826
Let us take the day off.

947
01:24:35,894 --> 01:24:38,488
I thought you said you want to go
out there and dig today.

948
01:24:38,563 --> 01:24:41,691
Well... I... we've been working too hard.

949
01:24:42,801 --> 01:24:46,032
Did you know that it's the 4th of July?

950
01:24:46,104 --> 01:24:48,834
What we'll do? Go into town and wave a flag?

951
01:24:48,907 --> 01:24:51,239
Yeah... maybe...

952
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:55,140
Um... well l just know that we have to be there.

953
01:24:57,849 --> 01:25:03,651
I just wanna welcome all of you
to our 4th of July celebration.

954
01:25:03,722 --> 01:25:09,217
As you know, our community has
suffered greatly during these past few days.

955
01:25:09,294 --> 01:25:13,458
We've lost our beloved postman, Joe Paulson.

956
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:19,232
And we pray for a speedy recovery
for his wife Becky.

957
01:25:19,304 --> 01:25:24,435
Our hearts and our prayers go out to
the Brown family in their hour of need

958
01:25:24,509 --> 01:25:27,876
as we continue our search for their son, Davey.

959
01:25:27,946 --> 01:25:31,541
And yet, in the face of all these tragedies

960
01:25:31,616 --> 01:25:34,779
our community has really joined together.

961
01:25:35,887 --> 01:25:38,947
I'm very proud of you.

962
01:25:39,024 --> 01:25:44,326
Would you please rise now and join
me in singing National?

963
01:25:45,830 --> 01:25:50,096

964
01:25:50,168 --> 01:25:54,798

965
01:25:54,873 --> 01:26:00,038

966
01:26:00,111 --> 01:26:03,046

967
01:26:14,959 --> 01:26:17,052
What's happening? Bobbi!

968
01:26:44,756 --> 01:26:48,692
Late last night and the night before,

969
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:52,719
Tommyknockers, Tommyknockers
knocking at the door...

970
01:26:53,698 --> 01:26:58,397
I wanna go out, I... I don't know if I can.

971
01:26:58,470 --> 01:27:02,770
It's alright, I'm here...
Gramps is here.

972
01:27:02,841 --> 01:27:06,937
'cause I... I learned this trick
from... the Tommyknocker men.

973
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,937
Tommyknockers, Tommyknockers
knocking at the door...

974
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Tommyknockers...

975
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,000
Tommyknockers...

976
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:36,500
Tommyknockers...

977
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:39,500
knocking at the door!
