1
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:22,083
Cuban.
- What's the word, Sawyer?

2
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,012
Looks like a match.

3
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,560
Yeah, ilk Joe.
We've got a series.

4
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,598
Same M. O.,
same signature, no DNA.

5
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,899
Not one goddamn shred.

6
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:43,232
You said that already.
I'm doing everything I can.

7
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,441
Goddamn fucking asshole.

8
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,946
Fuck.

9
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,423
I need to go see him.

10
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,376
Joe.

11
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,220
I think it's a mistake.

12
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,557
You're entitled to your own opinion.

13
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,563
Well, let me rephrase that.

14
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:20,641
I think it's a big mistake.

15
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,903
Apart from time and resources,
it's bringing an unknown into a...

16
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:27,861
into a really bad situation,
- Not unknown at all.

17
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:31,277
I've worked with him before,
and he's actually my friend.

18
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:34,117
You said he's unstable.
- I did not, Katherine.

19
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,657
I said he's had a hard time.

20
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,711
It's too early
for a Hail Mary, Joe.

21
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:48,336
You will learn it's never too early
for one of those.

22
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,390
Goddamn, are you seeing this?

23
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:05,026
I mean, look at all this."
pretty green shit.

24
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,900
How long has
he lived out here?

25
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,410
Two years.
Ever since his daughter Emma died.

26
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,995
Leukemia. In his arms.

27
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:30,132
Gave up his medical practice.
Hell, he gave up everything.

28
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,343
What happened to his wife?

29
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:44,149
Well, therein lies
the truth about tragedies.

30
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,186
They bring some people
closer together...

31
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,318
...drives others apart.

32
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,960
There it is.

33
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,967
Do you mind staying here?
Let me talk to him alone?

34
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,727
You could have left me in the city.
- I could've...

35
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:24,015
But you would have missed
the pretty green shit.

36
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,941
Sentiment.

37
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,509
Yeah?

38
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,094
John? It's Joe.
- Yeah, I know.

39
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,346
Are you gonna open the door?
I'd like to talk to you,

40
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,060
Nat interested.

41
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,852
John, I just drove three hours
to come and see you.

42
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:14,364
Come on. You know me well enough
to know that I'm not leaving,

43
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:17,151
And I'll kick down this door
if I have to.

44
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,418
A real pain in the ass.

45
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,290
Yeah. I've heard that before.

46
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:46,397
You know, I sent you a letter
like a year ago. Did you get it?

47
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,728
Yep.

48
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,019
What did it say, John?

49
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,025
"No parent should
outlive a child."

50
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,800
So you've been holed up here.
- Uh-huh.

51
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,390
I see you've settled in.

52
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:30,812
It's a beautiful day out there.
- That's what they tell me.

53
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,940
So you don't get out much?

54
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,969
Do you want a soda?
- No, thank you.

55
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,678
I don't have cigarettes.

56
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,718
I gave them up a few months ago.

57
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,724
Meet my new addiction.

58
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,808
Laura and the kid okay?

59
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,147
Yeah, they're good.
Thank you.

60
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,483
Heard from Elizabeth yet?

61
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,023
No.

62
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,525
You will.

63
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,242
So, besides wanting
to see you...

64
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:31,584
I've got a situation that
I'd like you to take a look at.

65
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:36,002
I could just tell you about the victims,
- I'm not interested.

66
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,462
By the way,
who's your girlfriend?

67
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,598
That is my loyal partner,
Agent Cowles,

68
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:49,011
who apparently doesn't listen
to a fucking word I say.

69
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,850
S.A.C., Joe.

70
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,858
I thought you might
want to take the call.

71
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,563
Excuse me, John.

72
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,412
Hi.
- Hi.

73
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,454
I brought the case tiles.
- It wasn't necessary.

74
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,666
The Agency has
changed the guidelines

75
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,252
for the way we break down
the cases.

76
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,338
It makes them more readable.

77
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,343
Oh. Well, that's a relief.

78
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,926
We gotta go.

79
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,059
Three murders,
Identical M, O.

80
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,186
Agent Cowles.

81
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,996
I'll leave the case files here.

82
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,583
John.

83
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,836
You okay?

84
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,053
If you change your mind
about this...

85
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,511
...you know where to ind me.

86
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,489
Hey, Joe.
- John.

87
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,195
I make no promises.

88
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:36,283
I'll stay maybe one day.
Maybe one week.

89
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,706
Deal. No promises.

90
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:43,127
You knew I'd come back?
- I had high hopes.

91
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:47,420
You remember Agent Cowles?
I should say "Dr." Cowles,

92
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:50,631
with a doctorate in...?
- Psychopathology,

93
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,757
She was to become a professor
before the bureau snagged her.

94
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:59,019
You gave up academia for this madhouse?
- They let me carry a gun.

95
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,396
Wow! So sexy.

96
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,608
You two will
make a good team.

97
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:10,273
John, you know when and Katherine, you
know why someone's about to do something.

98
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,736
Run this through until we come out.

99
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:16,745
Dr. Clancy, before we go upstairs,
with all due respect,

100
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:20,749
I don't hold an ounce of confidence
in the paranormal as a Held.

101
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,410
I think it's a sham.
I hope (hat's okay.

102
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,546
No problem at all.
I feel the same about shrinks.

103
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,048
After only one thing,
your money.

104
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,050
They'll take your whole hand.

105
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:34,383
Whoever said that has obviously
never met a good one,

106
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,092
It was Sigmund Freud.

107
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,145
Like I said, a hell of a team.

108
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,774
method.

109
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:50,733
Each victim was killed by
a puncture wound at the skull.

110
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,274
Inflicted by
a Eve-inch instrument.

111
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,284
It went straight into
the medulla oblongata.

112
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,822
Immediate, according to the coroner,
Painless execution.

113
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:06,291
These photos are all post-mortem.
- A couple of them almost look alive.

114
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,955
No mistakes.

115
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:15,220
Crime scenes so far have yielded
no evidence of DNA, hair-fibers,

116
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:18,131
shoe-prints, nothing.
- No witnesses, either.

117
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,928
Ward lived in a secured building.
No signs of forced entry.

118
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:28,021
On the psych front, it's unheard of.
There's no geographical, chronological

119
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,901
or astrological pattern
to the murder.

120
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,277
No robbery.

121
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,904
Other than thah
we got a good handle on this case.

122
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,531
John?

123
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,332
John.

124
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,251
Yeah.

125
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,923
Robert Ellis,
the kid in Mount Pleasant.

126
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,172
He was eating ice cream.
- He was.

127
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,257
Where do you want to start,
John?

128
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,554
Well...

129
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,769
..at the beginning?

130
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:16,030
The residence of
Mrs. Ethel Jackson, age 69.

131
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:20,360
She lived alone with three cats.
Was a regular at church.

132
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:25,032
Landlady grew suspicious when she
hadn't seen or talked to her in two days.

133
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,917
She was found killed
in that rocking chair.

134
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,037
On the TV,
the Cooking Channel played.

135
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,170
And the note we were looking at earlier?

136
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,926
Was here,
On this table.

137
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,136
My wife.
I need to take this.

138
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,346
Sweetheart, I...

139
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,315
What do you make of the note?
- As a shrink?

140
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,102
Yeah,
- it's a classic riddle.

141
00:14:55,478 --> 00:15:00,325
"l will tell you in two words who I am,
what I do and how I live. May I?"

142
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,662
Taunting questions
designed to mislead.

143
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:09,542
Asking our permission to reveal himself,
yet never intending to,

144
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:16,671
it's playful, but only one person
is playing here. it's solitaire,

145
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,720
Or is it something more?

146
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,885
Is it a cry for help?

147
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,972
An indication of
split personality disorder,

148
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:30,264
where the fiddler is
asking themselves, and us,

149
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,731
who they actually are? But no.
That's not consistent with the crime.

150
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,987
This is too controlled,
too sharp.

151
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,569
There's something else
going on here.

152
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,612
It's like he's looking for
someone.

153
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,753
So?
- She likes hats.

154
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,220
Hey. How are we doing?

155
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,634
Fantastic.

156
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,737
Katherine works up a full
profile based on the note.

157
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:23,617
Which she's finishing at home.
- Okay.

158
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,027
I'll see you in the morning,
- Yes.

159
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,033
John.

160
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:32,413
How about I buy you dinner?
Special treat. Best place in town.

161
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:33,792
Do I need a jacket?

162
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:38,206
Hell, no, you don't, I got connections,
I know the maitre d'.

163
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,882
Goddamn it,
This is so good!

164
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,047
John?
- No, I'm fine, thanks.

165
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:49,093
For John, one more please. Yeah?
- Coming up.

166
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,555
My boy has a rough time in school.
Came home in tears again today.

167
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,348
Being bullied?
- Yeah.

168
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,062
I don't know what to do.

169
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,654
Don't know. Give him a hug.
Tell him a joke.

170
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,195
A joke?
- Yeah. A joke.

171
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,029
I don't know any jokes.
I'm serious, John. Come on.

172
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,865
In the name of friendship,
tell me a joke.

173
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,409
Me?
I don't know any jokes.

174
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,369
Okay, just one, Um...

175
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,206
This woman, Mrs. Jones, uh,

176
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,293
was suffering from
a rare heart condition.

177
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:28,590
The doctor prescribes male hormones
to up her testosterone, 2 pills a day.

178
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,851
A month later
she goes back to the doctor and says...

179
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,979
"That medicine
is doing wonders for my heart.

180
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,812
But I'm growing hair
where it has never grown before."

181
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:44,232
"Don't worry, excessive hair is to be
expected. Where does ii grow exactly?"

182
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,570
She says, "On my balls, Doctor."

183
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,908
it's funny, isn't it?

184
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,158
I can't tell that
to my little boy.

185
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,832
Say "testicles"
- That cleans it right up.

186
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,089
Yeah. Biology.

187
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,791
It's a good joke,
- Yeah.

188
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,052
I thought you'd like that.

189
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,680
Elizabeth told me
that's why she fell in love with you.

190
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,468
Why was that?
- That smile.

191
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,808
Oh, the smile.
- Not your joke telling.

192
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,986
John, do I have another
sandwich coming here or what?

193
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,967
Tonight, as we were
leaving Ethel Jackson's,

194
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,306
you were onto something.
- Hmm.

195
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,439
Come on, John. Talk to me.
What do you know?

196
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:09,027
I want this over as quickly
and as badly as you do,

197
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,784
but you gotta tell me
what you're seeing.

198
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,489
I don't know yet.

199
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,192
John...

200
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,964
John.

201
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:30,108
Received an anonymous call

202
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:35,823
an hour ago offering way too specific
information about the Peter Ward murder.

203
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:41,207
Then listed a midtown address. Perimeter
is secured. They wait for us to go in.

204
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,625
Clear!

205
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,545
Clear!

206
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,009
Joe.
Take a look at this.

207
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,070
What do you think?

208
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,323
Four-sixteen. Bible verse?

209
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,530
No, it's the time.

210
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,861
Four minutes ago.

211
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,285
Four-sixteen precisely.

212
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,416
Your watch is fast.

213
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,794
Fuck. He's here.

214
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:52,483
Are you good?
- I'm good. Go.

215
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,742
Mrs. Raymond? FBI.

216
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,631
Would someone please
tum that shit off?

217
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:26,433
Bingo.
- Wound on the back of the neck.

218
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:30,020
Familiar,
- She's been dead for 5 or 6 hours.

219
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,026
Perp must have hung around.
- He left hours ago.

220
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:40,447
Would you two mind
clearing the room for us please?

221
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,657
Thank you.

222
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,537
John.

223
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,506
Same type font as 4:16
and the note at Ethel Jackson's.

224
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,211
Mm-hmm.

225
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,005
You okay?
- Shit,

226
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,012
Go ahead. Take a look.
- Can I touch her?

227
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,721
Yeah.

228
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,903
David.

229
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:33,379
David?

230
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,726
There you are. Come in.

231
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,937
Wash my back.

232
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:47,115
John?

233
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:50,744
You all right?
- Yeah.

234
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,705
What do you see?
- I'm not sure.

235
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,838
Okay.
- What?

236
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,346
Don't touch the bathwater.
- Why?

237
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,182
I'm not sure why.

238
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,722
Joe? Holy shit,
we may have a suspect.

239
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,435
Who?
- David Raymond.

240
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,525
The husband.

241
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,909
He says
he was at the bar all night.

242
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:35,576
His bartender and his breath
corroborate his story.

243
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,210
Agent Cowles are you ready?
- Yes, sir.

244
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,124
I want you to take the lead.

245
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:58,232
Mr. Raymond, a cup of coffee.

246
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:02,190
Been along night for all of us.
- Thank you.

247
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:04,814
If you don't mind...

248
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,738
...I'm just gonna jump
right into this. Okay?

249
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,699
Mr. Raymond,
- Yeah?

250
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:14,740
We regret to inform you that
your wife Victoria

251
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:16,746
died last night.

252
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,291
Jesus.

253
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:22,752
Jesus Christ.

254
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:29,551
Oh, God. Oh, God".

255
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,098
Mr. Raymond...

256
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:35,727
...you were seen leaving your building

257
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:39,311
last night in an agitated state.
Can you tell us why?

258
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:43,436
Did she leave a note?

259
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,984
Mr. Raymond,
your wife was murdered.

260
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:50,367
What?
- Your wife was murdered.

261
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,119
She didn't leave a note.

262
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:55,456
No! No! Oh, Jesus, God!

263
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:59,745
What do you think happened?
- She didn't commit suicide?

264
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,457
Why do you think that?

265
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:06,296
The letter, I wrote... I...
I wrote a letter.

266
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,802
This letter?
- No. What is that?

267
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,554
You didn't write this?

268
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,928
I left a letter.

269
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:19,438
What did it say?

270
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,401
David?

271
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:39,329
"l never meant to hurt
or betray..."

272
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,421
David?
What did the letter say?

273
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,508
He left her.

274
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:57,760
I was leaving her.

275
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,767
Okay.

276
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,315
You were leaving her, Why?

277
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,734
He left her for someone else.

278
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:08,191
I was leaving her
for someone else.

279
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,905
For another woman?

280
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:25,329
Yes.

281
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,793
He's lying.

282
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,586
Oh, V, I'm so sorry.

283
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:43,056
Uh, could I have a word with
Mr, Raymond?

284
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,690
Dr. Clancy...
- Joe?

285
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,937
All right.
- Thanks.

286
00:28:57,486 --> 00:29:00,660
You're telling the truth,
or at least some of it.

287
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,918
You didn't kill your wife
did you, Mr. Raymond?

288
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:06,874
No.

289
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:12,460
But you believe the note you left
could've driven her to take her own life.

290
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:17,556
Your wife had a history of
emotional instability.

291
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:23,513
And the note was telling her that you
were leaving her for someone else.

292
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:30,527
But your note failed to mention
you were leaving her for a man.

293
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,830
How the fuck do you know that?

294
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:46,961
That, in fact,
you had contracted HIV.

295
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:50,960
Is that right?

296
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:07,310
Her blood was contaminated.

297
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,442
"Careful with the bathwater."

298
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,523
I want to see the Tiles again.

299
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,569
It's 7:30. My family's up.
Breakfast?

300
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,279
Yeah.
- Let's go.

301
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:29,082
Thank you.
- Thanks, Laura.

302
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:32,206
You need to eat.
- I'm good, baby. Thank you.

303
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:35,421
Family is looking good, Joe.
- They are.

304
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:38,758
I try to spend as much time
as I can with them.

305
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,342
We've seen Elizabeth.

306
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,221
Oh, yeah?
- We've kept in touch.

307
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:47,479
Good.
- She still loves you, John.

308
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:55,150
All right. So, uh...
What do you think?

309
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:58,316
They were all
incurably sick, terminally ill.

310
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:02,328
That is the consistency.
- We explored that. It doesn't hold up.

311
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:05,205
Ethel Jackson.
The wigs, the hats...

312
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:08,208
She had chemotherapy.
- Three years ago,

313
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,916
She was in the clear, John.

314
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:12,830
No one's ever in the clear.

315
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:18,553
80% of cancers return. Whenever they do,
they're quite difficult to eliminate.

316
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,095
So?

317
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:27,386
Peter Ward, it tums out,
had Lou Gehrig's Disease.

318
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,226
That can be a very slow,
painful death.

319
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:33,689
Victoria Raymond suffered
chronic suicidal depression,

320
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:38,196
self-destructive behavior,
cutting, overdose, and so on.

321
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,733
Finished breakfast?
- Yes!

322
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,526
Hey. Backpack!

323
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,823
Yes.

324
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,619
Come here, say goodbye to John.

325
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,625
Bye-bye, John,
- Goodbye, monkey.

326
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,331
Give your dad a hug.

327
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:57,466
Bye, Dad. See you after school.
- Yeah. Have a good day.

328
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,796
Okay.

329
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:02,380
Have a good day at work.
- Bye, honey.

330
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,551
Let's say I give you Ethel Jackson
and Peter Ward,

331
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,812
Two words that destroy
this whole theory:

332
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,440
The boy Robert Ellis was healthy,

333
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:17,478
and as Christian Scientists,
his parents don't believe in medicine.

334
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,317
He had no medical file.

335
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,231
Well, It's go talk to them.
- Okay.

336
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:23,492
Remember your appointment?

337
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:28,531
Right. I have a phone call with the
director at 9:00 am,

338
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:33,373
which I am immensely looking forward to.
So Katherine will take you.

339
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:35,082
Okay.

340
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:37,998
Dr. Clancy...

341
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,088
How do you refer to it?

342
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,587
To what?

343
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:47,257
To, uh, what you have?

344
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:51,929
Is it prescience,
clairvoyance, precognition?

345
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,769
Oh, it's a hoot.
A laugh a minute.

346
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:58,148
Never mind. I'm serious.

347
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,943
What is it you see exactly?

348
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:05,029
Do you see people's futures?

349
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,195
Bits of their futures
and of their pasts.

350
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,409
It's all the same in the end.

351
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:13,621
Is it mystical? Or religious?
- No. I'm a scientist.

352
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,582
I believe in
theoretical physics and...

353
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:18,960
Biochemistry and that's it.

354
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:23,844
Whatever it is, I happen to get
the deluxe edition of what people now call

355
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,845
intuition or gut reaction.

356
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:30,889
Do you see anything now?

357
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,062
What do you mean? About you?

358
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,140
I guess so.

359
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:40,022
No. Nothing.

360
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,821
At all?
- Alall.

361
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,944
Just nothing.

362
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,071
Nothing at all.

363
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,751
So how's the investigation going?

364
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,295
It's improving.

365
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:04,676
We believe we know why
your son was killed, Why he was chosen.

366
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:09,723
Mr. Ellis, I need to ask you a few
questions but I don't want to upset you.

367
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:13,135
It's all right. Ask.
If I can, I'd like to help.

368
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:19,066
Do you remember in the weeks
or months leading up to Roberfs death,

369
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:22,103
was he at his best?
Was he healthy?

370
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:26,023
Perfectly.
- He never complained of any pain?

371
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:30,490
Did he ever have trouble keeping up
with other boys at school?

372
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,950
Was he ever short of breath?

373
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:36,625
Uh... No. No.

374
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,629
Be careful.
- I will.

375
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,260
Robert was a sculptor?

376
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,970
Yeah. He enjoys it.

377
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,978
He enjoyed it.
He had very good hands.

378
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,396
I'm so sorry, Mr. Ellis.

379
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:16,077
They're beautiful.
- Thank you.

380
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,617
What happened to this one?

381
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,747
He knocked it over
maybe a day or two before...

382
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,671
How did he knock it over?

383
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,928
I don't remember.
Kids are clumsy.

384
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,588
Robert especially?

385
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,844
Well...

386
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:37,974
Sometimes,
He'd upset his glass at dinner...

387
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,982
You're talking to them?
- They just got here.

388
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,813
Did you catch him?

389
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,732
No.

390
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:51,404
Then what are you doing here?
- Mrs. Ellis...

391
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,069
There was another murder
last night,

392
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:57,239
We believe it's the same man
that killed your son.

393
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:03,083
All of the other victims have suffered
from an illness or a condition...

394
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:07,715
Robert was 12. He wasn't sick.
- We'd like to verify that

395
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,342
How are you going to do that?

396
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,879
We conduct an autopsy.

397
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:16,141
You dig his body up, pry him open
and search around inside him?

398
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,721
Yes, we do.

399
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,512
Who are you?
- I'm a doctor.

400
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,348
He wasn't sick.

401
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:27,561
And even if he was,
he did not need a man like you.

402
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,819
It's fate.

403
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,827
It's just that some people
do not have the courage

404
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:38,113
to accept the wisdom of the Lord.

405
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,954
I agree with you, Mrs. Ellis, absolutely.

406
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,370
I know the limitations of medicine,

407
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:49,838
I've diagnosed many patients
with death growing inside them.

408
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,718
Like my own daughter,
She had Leukemia.

409
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:56,177
For 2 years,
I went to the hospital every day

410
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,886
and watched her suffer.

411
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,929
Every procedure, every test,
all totally useless, of course.

412
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:04,765
And one day she died.

413
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,021
And that was that.

414
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,483
In the end,
it was a blessing.

415
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,900
I do understand something about fate,
Mrs. Ellis.

416
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:20,281
And, uh, I certainly wouldn't use
medicine to alter God's plan.

417
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:24,327
I... just want to know
why your son was killed.

418
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,333
And medicine can help me
discover that.

419
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,381
And then, perhaps, it can
help me catch the man...

420
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,006
...who killed your little boy.

421
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:09,079
Dr. Clancy. Fax for you.
it's marked urgent.

422
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,795
What is it?

423
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,057
Check the cerebellar lobe.

424
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,857
Whoa!
What is this?

425
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,027
Well, there's your answer,
- What?

426
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,736
Brain tumor. Size of a pea.

427
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,197
Hidden in the cerebellar lobe.

428
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:48,452
John?
- What's up, Doc?

429
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,208
Christ!

430
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:03,976
John?
- I'm out. Finished.

431
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,984
The fax?
What the hell did it say?

432
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:16,313
I don't know.
It was urgent and confidential.

433
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,607
Somebody trained you too well.

434
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,823
John!

435
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:26,452
Goddamn it!
You gotta let somebody in on this!

436
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:33,296
We're walking right into a trap.
- What? You gotta talk to me.

437
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:38,301
He's way ahead of us.
And we do exactly what he wants us to do.

438
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,006
Don't you get it?

439
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:43,135
I'm out.

440
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,032
Doctor Clancy?

441
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,713
Hi.
- Hi.

442
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,726
Do you mind?
- Go ahead. You're paying for it.

443
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,690
So, we ind a tumor...

444
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,368
That no one could've
known about.

445
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,908
We've established connections

446
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:52,042
between victims that, I freely admit,
I could never have seen.

447
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,662
And instead of stepping up
and leading from the front,

448
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:59,173
you run out of an autopsy,
which you asked for,

449
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:02,673
coincidentally,
without any explanation,

450
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:07,136
and now you're packing your bags
and you're going home.

451
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,759
Forgive me, Clancy,

452
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,182
but what the fuck?

453
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,226
Hmm.

454
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:17,896
"Who am I?

455
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:22,898
I will tell you in two words
who I am, what I do, and how I live."

456
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:25,032
What about that riddle?

457
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,159
it's not a riddle,
- What is it?

458
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,948
"Le diro con due parole,
chi san, e che faccia, come vivo."

459
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:35,290
It's from La Bohéme by Puccini.
- So the killer is an opera nut.

460
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,920
That really helps with the profile.

461
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,626
Thank you, Clancy.
- No.

462
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,921
I'm the nut.
I'm the opera nut.

463
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:50,638
I happened to be listening to those lines,
the very moment I read your case files,

464
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:55,225
I I don't get it.
- He knew I'd be listening to that music.

465
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:57,811
He knew that you would ask me to help.

466
00:41:57,974 --> 00:42:03,481
He knew we would arrive at the
apartment at exactly 4:16 am.

467
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:08,368
Because he knows everything.

468
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:13,828
You see." He's just like me.
He sees things,

469
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:16,376
Only he's better at it.

470
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,912
A whole lot better.
Come, read that.

471
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,917
Come on, read it!

472
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,808
"Dr, Clancy,

473
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,401
Check the cerebellar lobe."

474
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,863
Okay.

475
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:49,159
So that's why you're quitting.

476
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,119
You've met your match.

477
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,242
Oh, no.

478
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,704
No. This guy, he's way beyond me.

479
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:01,587
I can't stop him,
which begs a more important question.

480
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:06,923
Is he really worth stopping?
These victims, they were dying anyway.

481
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:11,090
He's not killing them out of
compulsion, or anger, or any...

482
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,641
Deviant psychosis or so.

483
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:19,227
No, he's the cigar, the ice cream,
the cocktails, the flowers in the bathtub

484
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:23,063
and all that whacko stuff.
This guy is brilliant.

485
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:26,526
And he's killing them
with kindness.

486
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:30,946
Get it?
it's mercy killing.

487
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,111
Bullshit!
- Is it?

488
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,325
l!'s murder.
- Mm-hmm.

489
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,783
That may spare
a lot of suffering.

490
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:43,581
If this was your daughter, would you
be saying the same thing, Clancy?

491
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:51,004
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

492
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,305
it's just...

493
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:04,188
I know your...
I know your daughter died.

494
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:10,365
But we all die someday,
don't we?

495
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,988
So what is it...

496
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:19,916
...that's so terrible
that you can't talk about?

497
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:23,453
Okay!

498
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:26,923
Here's what I'm not telling you.

499
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,676
You Jost your virginity
to a drunk stud caff ed Bruce

500
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:33,338
in the back of his green
Ford Bronco at 17

501
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,723
You didn't like it very much because

502
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,350
he puked all over you.

503
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,682
5 years ago,
you had a boyfriend called Kevin.

504
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:42,392
No, sorry. Gavin.

505
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:45,650
A year into that
relationship you discovered

506
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:48,687
he thought
you were pregnant with his baby.

507
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:52,198
Gavin didn't want it
but you did, so he left you.

508
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,030
And 21:'2 months later,
the baby was bom.

509
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,866
A little girl, Amanda.

510
00:44:57,028 --> 00:45:00,498
But one day you decided
to give her up for adoption.

511
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,408
Iris breaking your heart,

512
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:07,832
tearing your guts out and that's why you
pretend to be so foul-mouthed and cool.

513
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:12,928
Exactly twice a year on each of your
parents' birthdays, Doreen and Frank,

514
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:15,713
On their birthdays, 11.
- '16 and 10.~'23,

515
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,723
you call them in Cincinnati

516
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:22,262
and tell them you love them,
they reply "We love you too, honey bunny."

517
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:26,979
And then you will cry your heart
out on that red goose down pillow.

518
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:30,020
And you'll hate my guts
for telling you all this.

519
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:33,907
But you know what, Agent Cowles?
Nobody gives a shit.

520
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:42,160
You want me to go on?

521
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:44,454
Go ahead.

522
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,374
What else do you see for me?

523
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:52,334
Just go home, Kathy.

524
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,429
Just go home.

525
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,392
I've gotta search.

526
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,582
Holy Mother of God.

527
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:24,597
Unsub is male, between
the ages of 18 and 35.

528
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:26,432
Mental illness likely.

529
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,769
Look for a man with
little personal hygiene,

530
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:35,195
someone conspicuously short
on social skills. A...

531
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:40,200
...mercurial or
an artistic temperament.

532
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:45,989
And for Christ's sakes ind
the bottom half of that dress.

533
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:52,582
Sexually motivated,
excessively violent.

534
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,132
This isn't even close
to our guy,

535
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,191
Hey, cop!

536
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:04,693
Joe.
- KATHERINE'S VOICEI John.

537
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:09,701
John!

538
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,452
Maybe you're right, John.

539
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:18,664
Maybe we can't catch this guy.
Maybe."

540
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:22,506
Maybe that's exactly what he wants.
We found a clue, John.

541
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:26,218
And I think it's a good one.
I want you to see it.

542
00:49:27,548 --> 00:49:30,051
Call ii a personal favor.

543
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,974
You know, something really bad
is going to happen.

544
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:42,693
Your mystery fax was sent over
the Internet by high anonymity proxy,

545
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:44,528
We had trouble tracking it.

546
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:48,786
We also did a chemical analysis
of Victoria Raymond's bathwater.

547
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:52,699
HIV positive which we knew
from the autopsy and from you.

548
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:56,665
But we found trace elements
of an anti-invertebrate toxin.

549
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,704
Snail poison. On the flowers.

550
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,968
John, I gotta ask.
Do you just know this weird crap

551
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,800
or are you seeing into
my brain right now?

552
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:11,100
We're here.

553
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:14,186
This is where
the flowers came from.

554
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,727
Hey.

555
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:22,478
I owe you an apology.
I'll explain later.

556
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:25,735
You okay?
- John.

557
00:50:25,898 --> 00:50:27,150
Yeah.

558
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,530
Yeah.

559
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,241
Wow.

560
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:38,001
We shouldn't be doing this.

561
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,128
Over here!

562
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:43,795
Too late now.

563
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:56,096
They look clipped,
Not tom off.

564
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,477
I'll call forensics.

565
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,358
John?
- Uh-huh?

566
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:03,519
You up for this?
- Yeah, sure.

567
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:43,480
it's over there.

568
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,614
The bottom half of the dress.

569
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,025
Shit!

570
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,198
Get Otis in from the 14th now!

571
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,200
I'm on it.

572
00:51:57,573 --> 00:52:02,079
We found the top half of
the dress pasted to a wall in a tenement.

573
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:07,425
At least half the victim's blood supply.
I was sure it wasn't our guy.

574
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,627
Still doesn't feel right.

575
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,965
Otis is here.
- And Otis is who?

576
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,054
Besides you,

577
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,428
he's the best there is.

578
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:23,816
Otis! Come on, boy. Let's go.

579
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,862
Where's the item?
- Right here.

580
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:34,735
Let's go, boy.
Find it,

581
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:36,904
Let's go! Move it up!
Let's go!

582
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:42,335
I want a 3-block perimeter.
We're on our way to Riverside.

583
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:45,372
How far do we follow him?
- As far as he goes,

584
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:49,292
I don't trust it.
Either this is useless or...

585
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:52,674
He's leading us somewhere,
maybe into a trap.

586
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:56,010
John, should I not follow the lead?
- No.

587
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:59,177
We have to follow him.
Christ, no! It's weird.

588
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:04,272
Let's go!

589
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:07,901
Possible subject location.
Give me all units, now!

590
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:12,318
You wearing a vest?
- Of course. We all are, John.

591
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:14,404
Let's go! Move it up!

592
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:22,662
2 men on each exit, 6 going in.
Sawyer runs the perimeter.

593
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:24,247
Let's go.

594
00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:27,208
Go!

595
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:32,835
Stairway up.

596
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:36,839
Landing. Clear.

597
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:38,925
Stairway up.

598
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:41,931
Landing, Clear.

599
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:46,644
Open door!
Closed door left

600
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:48,730
Hallway.
Closed door right.

601
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,522
Closed door left.

602
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:57,447
Closed door right.

603
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,656
FBI! Open up!

604
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,371
Go.

605
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,296
FBI! FBI!

606
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,628
Stay to your left!

607
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:16,470
Left side clear.
- Right side clear.

608
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:21,721
Room clear!

609
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:26,521
Whoa!
- Do you live here, sir?

610
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,149
Do you live here?
- This is my studio.

611
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:30,855
What's your name?

612
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,145
Linus Harp.

613
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:36,486
Do you know
who occupies the opposite studio?

614
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,571
No... No one does.

615
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:41,863
Turpentine?
- I'm a painter.

616
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:47,702
That's great, Can you
please step outside with us?

617
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:49,620
Can I lock up hrst?

618
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:52,586
No. Your studio is safe.
Step outside.

619
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,212
Frogs.

620
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:23,238
Freeze!

621
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:28,664
Man down!
- Move! Ambulance!

622
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,207
Agent down!

623
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,260
Suspect on foot!

624
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:41,673
He jumped out the window!
I'm coming down!

625
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,341
We gotta get him to county!

626
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:45,555
What?
- How's it look?

627
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:49,021
It's not great.
Get an ambulance! Now!

628
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:51,641
Go with Katherine.

629
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,434
Come on and get him!

630
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:58,481
Got anything?
- No sign!

631
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:00,615
We got anything? Anything?

632
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,383
What am I locking for?
- No idea!

633
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:24,264
White male...
- Left!

634
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:26,016
Left here?
- Left here.

635
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:28,222
Car heading west...

636
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:31,389
In pursuit.
- DISPATCHERZ Give us a description.

637
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:33,523
Right!
- We will when we can.

638
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:42,191
Yellow cab,
He's stolen a yellow cab.

639
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:50,658
I need a number.

640
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:58,090
Five. M. Four. Three.
- There!

641
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,691
Hey!

642
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,027
Look out!

643
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,115
We're gonna lose him!

644
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,536
Hey!

645
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:35,084
Take a left.
- He went straight!

646
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:36,790
Take a left!

647
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,302
Okay, stop!
- Sit back!

648
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,178
Stop the car!
- I got this!

649
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:49,183
Stop the fucking car!
What's the matter with you?

650
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:52,769
He's gonna get away.
- Just stop the car.

651
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,564
You want me to let him go?
- Shut up!

652
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,227
Come on! Come on!

653
00:58:05,107 --> 00:58:06,654
Right. Go!

654
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:54,658
You okay?
- Yeah. Are you?

655
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:56,662
Yeah.

656
00:58:58,035 --> 00:58:59,582
Where is he?

657
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,548
Where is he?

658
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:20,728
Hey, cop!

659
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:14,411
You're not him.

660
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:30,009
You want a moment alone with him?
- Yeah.

661
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:56,782
Did you get the guy?
- No, Katherine did.

662
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:58,827
Good for her.

663
01:01:01,283 --> 01:01:03,160
It wasn't the guy, was it?

664
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,165
Nope.

665
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:07,960
So you were right.

666
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,963
He was just leading us
down a path.

667
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:12,469
Mm-hmm.

668
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:16,257
Handing us that psychopath.

669
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:20,014
And now...

670
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:24,056
Now he's got another
terminal case to show for it.

671
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,979
Stage four cancer.

672
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,690
You'd picked up on that,
hadn't you?

673
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:31,734
I igured.

674
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:37,069
I appreciate you
not making me talk about it.

675
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:40,993
I got the diagnosis...

676
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:45,665
...a few months ago.
And...

677
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:48,877
It's too advanced
to do anything about it.

678
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:52,004
You will...

679
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:56,179
You'll check on Laura
and my little man now and then?

680
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:58,261
Yes, of course, I will.

681
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:03,432
Hell, John!

682
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:06,727
I'm not ready to die.

683
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,104
I guess, uh...

684
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:15,741
You know, I'd been planning on it.
I've been expecting it for a little bit.

685
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:19,574
But not for a few more months.
You know, I...

686
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,822
I have so much stuff to do.

687
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:26,501
I want to move Laura
to the country.

688
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:29,963
I want to teach my little boy
to drive.

689
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:33,466
You were always
a lousy driver.

690
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:35,510
I know.

691
01:02:37,504 --> 01:02:39,973
I wanted him to
take after his dad.

692
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:47,059
You know, we, uh...

693
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:51,105
We want for so much in life,
you know?

694
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,779
And then we get it.

695
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:58,025
I have it.

696
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:01,536
But I've run out of time.
There's just no time left.

697
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:06,499
Well, you did a hell of a lot
with your life and time.

698
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:08,622
My friend.

699
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:11,667
Not enough, John,
- You did.

700
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:13,961
No.

701
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:20,923
It's good having you back,
you know?

702
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:23,804
Hey.

703
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:26,387
Tell me one of your
crappy jokes.

704
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:32,650
Crappy joke? How about I disconnect you?
Would that make you laugh?

705
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:36,112
It's true.
You really fucking can't.

706
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:44,075
That smile right there.

707
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:48,204
You do me a favor. You take that
to Elizabeth, Okay?

708
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,455
You make it up with her.

709
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:13,437
I'm sorry I said to you
what I said last night.

710
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:20,107
You wanted to tell me
something at the park.

711
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:21,820
What was that?

712
01:04:23,151 --> 01:04:24,698
Oh, yeah, I remember.

713
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,243
Yes, it was a...

714
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:33,871
...beautiful Sunday afternoon.
June 24th 1990.

715
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:37,666
I watched my daughter
playing in the garden.

716
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:40,130
Everyone singing
"Happy Birthday."

717
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:42,045
It was her sixth birthday.

718
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:44,965
All the other kids had a great time.

719
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:47,429
Suddenly, there it was.
I saw it...

720
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:50,929
Standing just behind her,
behind Emma.

721
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:54,274
It was a shadow.

722
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:56,685
It was moving like a curtain.

723
01:04:57,936 --> 01:04:59,529
Moving in the breeze.

724
01:05:00,772 --> 01:05:05,152
I knew it was no trick of the light.
I could feel it all around me,

725
01:05:05,777 --> 01:05:07,871
Inside me.
Oh, God.

726
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:11,370
It was weird.

727
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:15,500
And then it just sort of faded away.
And, uh...

728
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:20,835
I didn't tell anyone,
not even my wife Elizabeth, no one.

729
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:23,511
But I had no doubt,
no doubt at all.

730
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:29,719
And 20 years later,
to the exact day, she called us.

731
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:32,850
Thursday morning, 9:23.

732
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:36,566
I thought, "Okay,
This is it. Here we go."

733
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:38,397
Then came the diagnosis,

734
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:40,482
Leukemia,

735
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:45,154
followed by two years of
agonizing treatment.

736
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:48,578
Then came the worst day
of my life when she...

737
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:50,993
...died.

738
01:05:51,823 --> 01:05:53,370
And she was gone.

739
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:56,293
Emma.

740
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:10,138
And on the third day,
He arose from the dead,

741
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:12,845
In accordance
with the scriptures.

742
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:15,146
He ascended into heaven

743
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:18,266
and sits at the right hand
of the Father.

744
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:21,524
He will come again in glory,

745
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:24,322
to judge the living and
the dead,

746
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:28,531
And his kingdom
will have no end.

747
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:31,405
Amen.

748
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:56,016
Kevin, come here.

749
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:00,062
I know, okay.

750
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:57,157
Hey.

751
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:05,173
I Your time is near

752
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:10,087
Anything else?
- I'll have the same again.

753
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:19,850
I wanted to meet you for so long.

754
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:22,061
We're finally face-to-face.

755
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:25,856
Here you go.

756
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:28,818
Could I have another one of these?
- Sure.

757
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:34,660
John, each life I take,

758
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:38,081
it's a life that's saved
from enormous pain.

759
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:42,748
I see what lies ahead for them.
The suffering and the sickness.

760
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:44,753
I see them writhing in agony.

761
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:47,756
I hear them screaming,
begging for release.

762
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:50,634
They beg for it, John.

763
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:54,176
And I grant them their wish.

764
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:56,178
Only better.

765
01:08:56,758 --> 01:08:59,386
I get there before
the wish is even made.

766
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:02,347
I get there before
the pain even starts.

767
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:06,234
As for their loved ones,
there's always an autopsy

768
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:08,815
when the existing
condition is found.

769
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:12,733
That's when I see them
go from shock to relief.

770
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:15,864
I hear them say things like,

771
01:09:16,027 --> 01:09:18,029
"Thank God it was so sudden."

772
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:20,039
"At least she felt no pain."

773
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:24,039
In the end, they're grateful
for what I've done.

774
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:31,714
That's why I helped
your friend Joe.

775
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:37,804
He had 73 days
of horrific pain ahead.

776
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:42,353
Do you know what beneits
his family would've gotten?

777
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:47,063
Dying of natural causes,
14 years into his career? None.

778
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:51,526
Now his wife gets a pension,
putting their son through college.

779
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:53,907
Stanford, actually.

780
01:09:54,065 --> 01:09:57,035
You think Joe wouldn't have
taken that deal?

781
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:02,327
Please don't call to them.

782
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:04,709
Come on.
You know I have a gun on me.

783
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:11,583
He's got a gun!
- Gun! Get down!

784
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:17,630
Drop the gun!

785
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:25,058
I've seen all possible
outcomes of this meeting.

786
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,895
I walk away healthy
from each one.

787
01:10:28,516 --> 01:10:31,235
One version's gruesome for our waitress

788
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:35,365
who'd be unlucky as her shift ends
in a couple of minutes.

789
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:39,615
I don't enjoy the work I do.
John, it's not a fetish.

790
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:44,116
It's about allowing those who are
already dying

791
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:46,205
...to die with some dignity.

792
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:57,133
Sometimes the greatest acts of love
are the hardest acts to commit.

793
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:09,308
Why are you giving me
the silent treatment?

794
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:14,813
I got it.
It's a lot to process.

795
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:25,324
That wasn't supposed to happen.

796
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:29,793
To be continued.
He's got a gun!

797
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:31,625
He's got a gun!
He's go ( a gun!

798
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:36,089
It's him for Christ's sake!
Leave me alone! Get him!

799
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:42,845
Oh, he was drinking beer.
But it was non-alcoholic.

800
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:45,385
He had a scar on his forehead.

801
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:48,430
It was kind of jagged, like, scar.

802
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:53,943
Here are all unsolved
murders over the last 10 years

803
01:11:54,101 --> 01:11:55,899
with terminally ill victims.

804
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:58,941
How many?
- 7. No punctures to the medulla,

805
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:00,699
but all painless.

806
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:03,327
Poisons, gas.
- These are all local?

807
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:05,614
You want the national data, too?

808
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:16,920
Is this how you saw if?
What is Atticus?

809
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:20,303
John?
- We're connected.

810
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:23,465
We We the same animal.
Does this /oak familial?

811
01:12:23,631 --> 01:12:25,383
I'm scared.

812
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:27,393
Did she leave a note?

813
01:12:35,518 --> 01:12:37,520
Concentrate, John.

814
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:39,734
Focus, John.

815
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:43,613
John!

816
01:12:50,575 --> 01:12:53,169
Hey, cop!
- Pm scared.

817
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:02,178
Just... focus.

818
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,717
Concentrate, John.

819
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:13,139
Focus.

820
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:26,365
62 in the last 10 years,
ranging from Juneau to Miami Beach.

821
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,074
Shit!

822
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:33,580
Do one more search.
Remove the terminal constraint.

823
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:36,917
Look for other unsolveds
in the same time period.

824
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:41,376
The killer may have known
they were sick when no one else did.

825
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:45,009
Run everything
against this description:

826
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:49,927
Male, 30s, front-left cranial scar,
almost certainly post-surgical.

827
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:51,844
Bring me everything...

828
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:54,726
Anything you come across, Okay?

829
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:06,109
Hmm.

830
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:24,260
That's what it means,
"Congratulations, partner."

831
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:25,965
I'm getting upped!

832
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:31,051
That's what 20 minutes
with a rich geriatric will get you.

833
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:38,603
Well, I'm the youngest partner
in the Hrm's history.

834
01:14:38,766 --> 01:14:40,860
You can tell your friends that.

835
01:14:45,773 --> 01:14:49,744
I don't know, I mean."
Bring me them on Monday?

836
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:52,496
Whatever they think is right.

837
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:55,124
How to keep. Is there any,

838
01:14:55,282 --> 01:14:56,829
is there none such

839
01:14:56,993 --> 01:15:00,998
bow or brooch or braid or brace,
latch or catch or key to keep,

840
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:04,713
keep it, beauty, beauty,
beauty from vanishing away.

841
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:09,680
'O is there no frowning
of these ranked wrinkles deep down?

842
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:12,433
No waving off of these messengers...

843
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:15,811
Stiff messengers sad and
stealing messengers of grey.

844
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:17,563
No, there's none.

845
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:20,521
Nor can you lang be what
you now are, called fail.

846
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:23,106
Do what you may do,
do what you may.

847
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:25,863
Wisdom is early to despair.

848
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:29,279
So, be beginningm"

849
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:32,031
Hello, John.
- Hello, Charles.

850
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:36,870
"Nothing can be done to keep at bay
age and age's evils, hoar hair,

851
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:39,877
fuck and wrinkle,
deathk winding sheets,

852
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:43,631
tombs and worms
and tumbling to decay."

853
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:50,046
Anyway, you were right about me.

854
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:53,011
I was... What's the word?
- Conflicted.

855
01:15:53,174 --> 01:15:58,055
I was conflicted about you.
Yeah. But not anymore. Oh, no.

856
01:15:58,596 --> 01:16:01,440
You had no right to take
one hour, one minute,

857
01:16:01,599 --> 01:16:07,106
not even one second of time
away from my friend, Joe Merriweather.

858
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:12,694
I don't know if you've ever really known
anyone who was dying, Charles.

859
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:16,990
Watched them struggling
on the edge of terror and horror

860
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:20,163
as they try to hold onto life.
I don't know,

861
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:25,708
but if you had, perhaps you would
have appreciated how time at the end is...

862
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:27,875
...kind of precious, I guess.

863
01:16:30,211 --> 01:16:32,839
Ax that point,
even the pain of life itself

864
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:37,181
may be quite beautiful.
You know what I mean?

865
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,471
Is that how
your daughter felt?

866
01:16:41,222 --> 01:16:42,769
That her...

867
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:48,150
...her pain was "beautiful?"
- Well, my friend,

868
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:50,565
I'm afraid you won't ind out.

869
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:59,161
Who the fuck are you guys?
- Sit down and shut up.

870
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:08,624
I don't see you pulling
that trigger.

871
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:10,338
Ditto.

872
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:13,345
This is not your style, it's not mercy,
- No?

873
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:18,138
A bullet to the head is better
than what he's got coming.

874
01:17:18,592 --> 01:17:21,186
You see, Jeffrey here...

875
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:25,475
Has a Tight ahead of him
with neuroiibromatosis.

876
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:30,651
And that's gonna tum him into
a writhing, crooked beast,

877
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:36,782
Tomorrow night, after some cocktails,
Jeffrey gets his girlfriend pregnant.

878
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:40,244
And the real charm about NFB
is that it's hereditary.

879
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:44,707
There's a 50 percent chance
the kid gets it, but l can tell you now:

880
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:48,213
the kid... gets it.

881
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:53,878
What's NFB?
- And you want to gift him that suffering?

882
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:56,179
Destroy three lives in one,

883
01:17:56,839 --> 01:18:00,309
all because of
some moral judgment?

884
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:03,388
We can't play God.

885
01:18:03,554 --> 01:18:06,273
No. I have no interest
in playing God.

886
01:18:06,724 --> 01:18:11,150
As far as His work is concerned,
I'm not impressed.

887
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:22,577
it's okay.

888
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:26,293
Look at you.
You're so confused.

889
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:30,123
You don't even know
which one of us to shoot.

890
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,592
You'll figure it out
soon enough.

891
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:37,805
Call an ambulance.
You've been poisoned.

892
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:42,434
You need to get to hospital.
Throw up, vomit, whatever. Drink milk.

893
01:18:42,593 --> 01:18:44,140
Good luck.

894
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:49,188
I think we got him.
Your search came back.

895
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:53,776
I crossed him with the gun records.
Gun was bought by a Charles Ambrose.

896
01:18:53,938 --> 01:18:56,908
Oh, man.
Let's go.

897
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:39,533
Concentrate, John.

898
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,737
Someone dies tonight.

899
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,329
Don't lose me now.

900
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:03,925
FBI! Open door right!
Open door left!

901
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:08,020
Move in!
Room, clear!

902
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:23,240
What is this place?
No furniture? Nothing?

903
01:20:23,902 --> 01:20:25,449
Not a bad view.

904
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:29,078
Listen!

905
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:31,581
Katherine!

906
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:36,836
Who is Charles Ambrose?

907
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:39,964
Who is he, F95/W?

908
01:20:40,127 --> 01:20:44,257
How the fuck's he doing this?
- I know what the;/7/ look for:

909
01:20:44,423 --> 01:20:48,428
Dysfunctional childhood
that involved abuse and neglect.

910
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:50,975
Later on...

911
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:55,314
Couldn'f hold a job,
couldn't keep a relationshm.

912
01:20:56,226 --> 01:20:58,604
Wrong on all counts,
- What the...

913
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:09,577
Concentrate.

914
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:17,256
Mom never Iefl me.
Dad never beat me.

915
01:21:17,414 --> 01:21:21,965
You won't rind any trace of violence
or antisocial behavior in my past.

916
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:24,346
I'm not a radical

917
01:21:24,505 --> 01:21:27,429
I have no interest
in fame or power.

918
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:33,390
I Tn simply a man
who could no longer look away.

919
01:21:36,058 --> 01:21:37,731
Don't stop.

920
01:21:45,275 --> 01:21:49,405
God knows I would prefer
to five the quiet life."

921
01:21:51,365 --> 01:21:54,118
...away from all that
I have became.

922
01:21:56,203 --> 01:21:59,047
But we don't always get
to choose what we are.

923
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:03,593
There you go.

924
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:27,568
It hurts so bad.

925
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,070
I'm so scared.

926
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:48,047
OfHcer Pearce,
My name is Charles Ambrose.

927
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:53,640
Tell your supervisor you just met me.
It will do wonders for your career.

928
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:56,771
OfHcer Pearce here.

929
01:22:57,389 --> 01:23:01,394
And now the savior"
needs ta be saved.

930
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:12,655
Clancy doesn't want you
to respond, Agent Cowles.

931
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,949
Sloman.

932
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:19,663
He doesn't want you
there when it happens. But you will.

933
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:22,047
You7/ respond.
Yau7l be there.

934
01:23:23,165 --> 01:23:24,838
You can? heh) yourself

935
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:27,590
Hey.

936
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:29,505
Hey, a beat cop

937
01:23:30,297 --> 01:23:33,551
just reported a Charles Ambrose
at Ashland Station.

938
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:38,438
Where are you going?
Hey! Get back here.

939
01:23:39,139 --> 01:23:40,686
See you soon.

940
01:25:01,388 --> 01:25:03,106
And here you are.

941
01:25:04,891 --> 01:25:07,986
Welcome.
- Thank you.

942
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:12,241
Just as I've seen it all those years.
You, me, this train,

943
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:16,199
You've seen it, too, right?
You've heard it? Day after day?

944
01:25:22,534 --> 01:25:24,628
Except something's not right.

945
01:25:40,218 --> 01:25:44,598
This is Agent Cowles. Our suspect
is headed into Ashland Station.

946
01:25:44,765 --> 01:25:50,522
We'll have the engineer stop the train
in a station up ahead where we'll set up.

947
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:52,860
Then what?
- We take him out.

948
01:25:53,023 --> 01:25:56,277
I advise you to stay clear.
- I'm not staying clear,

949
01:25:56,443 --> 01:25:59,322
We have control. Stay clear.

950
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:02,620
Shit!

951
01:26:06,745 --> 01:26:08,292
We're connected.

952
01:26:09,206 --> 01:26:13,211
The same animal,
- No, no. I'm not a killer.

953
01:26:13,377 --> 01:26:17,348
We can talk about that in seven minutes,
- Seven minutes?

954
01:26:18,882 --> 01:26:20,884
That's when you kill someone.

955
01:26:21,051 --> 01:26:23,850
Who might that be?
- Me.

956
01:26:24,346 --> 01:26:26,690
Move, Move!
Move in!

957
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:29,059
Let's go!
- Move!

958
01:26:29,226 --> 01:26:30,728
Go!
Move!

959
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:35,023
Go!
Move! Move! Move!

960
01:26:37,317 --> 01:26:39,069
Train is five minutes out!

961
01:26:39,945 --> 01:26:42,118
Let's go! Move!

962
01:26:43,115 --> 01:26:44,708
I'm dying, John.

963
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:47,289
I can'! continue this work anymore.

964
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:50,331
That's why I need someone
to carry on for me.

965
01:26:50,789 --> 01:26:53,542
Someone who can see the pain.

966
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:56,337
The suffering. Sickness.

967
01:26:56,837 --> 01:27:00,842
There's another reason you have
to shoot me that you don't see.

968
01:27:01,007 --> 01:27:02,634
Concentrate!

969
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:08,106
John.

970
01:27:08,265 --> 01:27:09,266
John.

971
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:11,768
There it is. Thank you.

972
01:27:12,436 --> 01:27:14,029
Agent Cowles.

973
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:16,531
You've grown so fond of her.

974
01:27:17,441 --> 01:27:19,694
It's like having
your daughter back.

975
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:22,204
I'm sorry.
You've lost me, Charles.

976
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:26,162
She doesn't tit your profile.
Why would you kill her?

977
01:27:26,324 --> 01:27:30,670
You're right.
I won't kill her. She's perfectly healthy.

978
01:27:30,829 --> 01:27:34,379
That's the beauty of it.
You're going to stop me first.

979
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:37,511
Yes,
With one bullet, right here.

980
01:27:39,004 --> 01:27:42,975
And after that, there's no turning back.
- Sorry, my friend.

981
01:27:43,133 --> 01:27:45,352
The game stops here and now.

982
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:49,981
I want 4 shooters, 3 low, 1 high!
Train is 60 seconds out.

983
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:51,983
Let's go, Move!

984
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:55,817
FBI!

985
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:59,028
Ma'am...
- FBI! Let me through!

986
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:03,077
Look at me, John.

987
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:05,702
Does this look familiar?

988
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:21,554
See now?

989
01:28:24,424 --> 01:28:26,472
All your visions
become real,

990
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:34,189
50 seconds to target.

991
01:28:34,351 --> 01:28:37,195
Do you have a visual?
- Captain.

992
01:28:37,354 --> 01:28:39,152
Do you have a shot?
- Afhrmative.

993
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:42,443
She's going to make it
just in time.

994
01:28:45,362 --> 01:28:48,457
Take the shot!
- Take the shot!

995
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:50,750
Fuck! I lost him!

996
01:28:52,536 --> 01:28:54,664
Take the shot!

997
01:28:55,539 --> 01:28:59,589
Target is locked,

998
01:28:59,751 --> 01:29:01,344
Let's go!

999
01:29:04,214 --> 01:29:06,342
Say hello to your destiny,
John,

1000
01:29:15,559 --> 01:29:16,936
Fire!

1001
01:29:19,646 --> 01:29:21,489
Hold! Hold!

1002
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:36,705
I told you you'd kill me.

1003
01:29:36,872 --> 01:29:39,295
Clear to ire!

1004
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:09,537
John,
- You're okay.

1005
01:30:11,781 --> 01:30:13,328
You're okay.

1006
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,107
Oh, hi,

1007
01:30:42,729 --> 01:30:43,776
Hey.

1008
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:48,368
How are you doing?
- I spoke to the chief surgeon.

1009
01:30:48,526 --> 01:30:50,870
He said the surgery was a success.

1010
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:55,079
Good.
- He said the bullet went clean through.

1011
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:01,089
I was hoping you would
consider a reinstatement.

1012
01:31:01,247 --> 01:31:04,046
As Joe said,
we'd make a hell of a team.

1013
01:31:04,209 --> 01:31:05,882
Oh no, I want a quiet life.

1014
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:07,841
Yeah.

1015
01:31:11,049 --> 01:31:13,143
Joe would be proud of you.

1016
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:28,491
Don't cry,
You're a good kid.

1017
01:31:32,779 --> 01:31:35,373
It was good
working with you, John.

1018
01:31:37,075 --> 01:31:39,703
I'll see you around.
- See you around.

1019
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:43,048
Take care of yourself.
- I will.

1020
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:48,006
Oh, yeah, um...

1021
01:31:49,004 --> 01:31:52,554
Nearly forgot. Could you
help me with this?

1022
01:31:52,716 --> 01:31:54,389
See it gets to delivered.

1023
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:01,270
I got it.

1024
01:32:05,854 --> 01:32:07,151
Joe.

1025
01:32:30,170 --> 01:32:31,797
Hello, Elizabeth.

1026
01:32:32,464 --> 01:32:34,057
Hello, John.

1027
01:32:34,841 --> 01:32:36,388
You look so beautiful.

1028
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:42,645
I read your letter,
Several times.

1029
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:45,818
It's different
than the others.

1030
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:47,524
Which way?

1031
01:32:49,355 --> 01:32:50,948
It's all about the past.

1032
01:32:51,858 --> 01:32:53,405
Oh, yeah?

1033
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:58,160
Yeah, I think of Emma.
Every single day,

1034
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:05,838
Come here.

1035
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:10,752
it's okay.

1036
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:29,150
It hurts.

1037
01:33:31,648 --> 01:33:33,446
I'm scared.

1038
01:33:36,402 --> 01:33:38,621
I'm so scared.

1039
01:33:45,829 --> 01:33:48,378
Oh, my...
It hurts.

1040
01:34:32,792 --> 01:34:35,966
Sometimes
the greatest acts of love...

1041
01:34:36,129 --> 01:34:38,427
, Hare the hardest acts
ta commit.

1042
01:34:46,347 --> 01:34:48,395
