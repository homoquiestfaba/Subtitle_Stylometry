00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:07,508
Claire, if you could say
one thing

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:08,842
to all the viewers at home
watching...

4
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,511
what would you want
to say to them?

5
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:16,216
Make sure to spread a lot
of love and happiness and joy

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,085
in whatever way you can

7
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:21,388
because there's always someone
who needs that.

8
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,390
There's...

9
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,880
What the fuck is that?

10
00:00:24,951 --> 00:00:26,276
Construction.

11
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:27,595
Can they stop?

12
00:00:27,665 --> 00:00:29,279
We can't hear you, I mean,
we can't hear it. Don't worry.

13
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:31,064
Yes, you can.

14
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:33,635
Go silent fully.

15
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,412
Even if we can hear it,
doesn't matter.

16
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:39,439
It's all good.

17
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:43,110
I'm a Scorpio
and we are perfectionists.

18
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:44,546
(clapping hands)

19
00:00:44,613 --> 00:00:45,796
Do you believe in Astrology?

20
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,816
I love astrology.

21
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:52,452
(door opening)

22
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:53,688
- Earl?
- Oh.

23
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:56,791
Hey! Wait, does it make sense
for me to just be standing here,

24
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:58,284
like, ready to open
the door for you?

25
00:00:58,362 --> 00:00:59,282
Yeah, dude. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:00,099
Okay, um...

27
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:01,245
Don't worry, don't overthink it.

28
00:01:01,307 --> 00:01:02,739
All right, let's do it...
let's do it one more time.

29
00:01:02,786 --> 00:01:04,397
Just be natural.
Just be natural, okay?

30
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,467
Yeah, yeah, I'm natural.

31
00:01:07,502 --> 00:01:08,736
(door closes)

32
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:09,737
(door opens)

33
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:11,338
Hey!

34
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:12,640
- Hey!
- Come on in!

35
00:01:12,674 --> 00:01:14,107
What you doin' out there?

36
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,611
Recording.

37
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:19,112
All right,
so we are about to enter

38
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:21,883
the un-enterable land...

39
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,184
I'm just kidding.
Okay, let's start over.

40
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:25,185
(exhales)

41
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:27,487
I'm nervous. Um...

42
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:31,826
All right, so we are going
to enter my bedroom.

43
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,828
Really... oops.

44
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:35,971
You want me to stop recording?

45
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,332
Hold on.

46
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:39,166
Hey!

47
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,635
I don't know
why I'm saying hey

48
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:42,336
as if I didn't
already greet you.

49
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:44,271
All right, so, are you ready

50
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,908
to enter the one, the only,

51
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:48,810
Claire's Corner?

52
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:51,244
- Oops.
- Whoa.

53
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,413
Didn't clean up this penny.

54
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,683
I'll just put that right there.

55
00:01:55,717 --> 00:01:57,317
This is your bedroom?

56
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:59,554
Yeah, in all of its glory.

57
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:02,924
I love my bed.

58
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:04,391
It's so comfy.

59
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:07,762
I read somewhere that...

60
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:10,765
the more personalized decor...

61
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,199
Ahh!

62
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,935
There was a bug, sorry.

63
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:15,937
(laughing)

64
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,538
Um, I read somewhere

65
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:20,307
that the more personalized decor
you have,

66
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,409
the further away you are
from God

67
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:25,312
because God...

68
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,682
I don't know, it had something
to do with Heaven

69
00:02:27,715 --> 00:02:29,784
being a light, white space.

70
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:34,589
So, I believe that light,
clear, airy, white spaces

71
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:37,959
are resembling Heaven.

72
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:41,428
I did... I think I read that
one time.

73
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,397
I don't remember where.

74
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,298
(sighs)

75
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,368
I had just gotten done
with my 1:30 vinyasa flow

76
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:51,338
and something about getting
the blood pumping

77
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,708
through my body and, um,

78
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:58,245
fres... fresh oxygen throwing...
flowing through my veins, um...

79
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,179
Does it look good?

80
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,516
So I kind of got out
and was like, "Whoa,

81
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:02,850
I need to make a documentary."

82
00:03:02,884 --> 00:03:04,986
I need to do this,
and I called up my dad

83
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:06,988
and I was like,
"This is something

84
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:09,557
that's really, really,
really important to me,"

85
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,592
and, um, I was able to work

86
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:13,628
a little bit
of my Claire magic on him,

87
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:16,163
and eventually I got him
to come around.

88
00:03:16,218 --> 00:03:19,116
Um, does your family...
so, does he support you a lot?

89
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:23,504
He supports me in no way
except... financial support.

90
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,381
So your dad only supports you
financially?

91
00:03:26,427 --> 00:03:27,147
Mm-hmm.

92
00:03:27,186 --> 00:03:28,750
And you don't consider that
to be support?

93
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:31,512
Hmm...

94
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:32,980
No.

95
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:35,482
Money is just money.

96
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:37,618
It's nothing, it goes away,

97
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:41,388
and it literally grows on trees.

98
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,758
So...

99
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:48,029
I mean, I would rather be poor
and have...

100
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,565
you know...

101
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,524
But you don't want to try?

102
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,636
Well, I can't.

103
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,305
I'm not poor.

104
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,372
Unfortunately.

105
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,408
My first kind of rendezvous

106
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,544
with spirituality was...

107
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:05,813
Well, I was at the book store.

108
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:09,282
And I saw something

109
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:13,554
from someone
who is now my favorite

110
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:16,356
or one of my favorite
spiritual gurus,

111
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:20,027
and, um, I opened up his book,
Tony Robbins,

112
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:21,596
and it said just,

113
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:24,364
"Get off your lazy ass
and go do it!"

114
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:27,969
And that was like, whoa.

115
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:31,005
I just had to take a step back
and take that in.

116
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,564
You know, it's funny,
'cause Tony Robbins

117
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,817
isn't really seen as
a spiritual teacher.

118
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:38,846
Maybe not for you.

119
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:44,919
I always felt like
I had a grand purpose,

120
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,655
like, there was something
in Claire

121
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:50,525
that was more than just
the average person.

122
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:56,329
I wanna be this thing
that is one with the cosmos.

123
00:04:56,363 --> 00:05:02,003
I wanna be Claire Cosmos,
Extraordinaire.

124
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:05,807
And that means shedding
all of my egoic tendencies.

125
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,744
That means realizing
that I am one with everything.

126
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:13,714
That means becoming
my most authentic self.

127
00:05:13,748 --> 00:05:16,383
That means letting go
of past traumas

128
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,352
and hurts and pains,
of which I have so many.

129
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:21,488
(sighs)

130
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:22,890
I'm letting go.

131
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:25,358
Yeah.

132
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:31,566
I'm ready to be
a perfect human form...

133
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:32,733
more-than-human form.

134
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:35,435
I'm ready to transcend humanity

135
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:39,574
and be a beam of light

136
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:42,543
in a human form.

137
00:05:42,577 --> 00:05:44,812
And I'm just really,
really, really excited

138
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:46,379
to figure it all out.

139
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:49,449
Let our journey begin.

140
00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:54,989
Um, so, viewers, I figured
that I might as well start

141
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,658
where I had the idea,
which is the yoga studio,

142
00:05:57,692 --> 00:05:59,627
and talk to the masters
over there.

143
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,062
So, are you ready?

144
00:06:01,095 --> 00:06:02,697
- I'm ready.
- Let's go!

145
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,998
I'm asking them, but they're...

146
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,867
they can't answer,
so they're ready.

147
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,501
I say you're ready.

148
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:09,103
(keys jingling)

149
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,371
I think you have to lock up.

150
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:15,776
Ah, no one ever comes up here.
It's fine.

151
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,512
I leave it unlocked. Shh.

152
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:19,780
Don't break in, please.

153
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:20,948
(chuckles)

154
00:06:23,618 --> 00:06:25,019
(tapping microphone)

155
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,055
This elevator's really slow.

156
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:28,936
(sighs)

157
00:06:28,975 --> 00:06:30,516
It's pretty cool you have
your own elevator.

158
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:33,828
I know, right?

159
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:35,997
Yeah, it kinda smells bad
sometimes, though.

160
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,165
It's the only downside.

161
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,134
(elevator doors closing)

162
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:47,324
Are you excited that you're
making your documentary?

163
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:50,177
If it turns out good.

164
00:06:50,216 --> 00:06:51,912
I think it will.

165
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:53,214
Well, I guess...
that's actually

166
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:54,515
really reassuring
to hear you say it,

167
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:57,218
because you're the one holding
the camera, so if you think...

168
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,220
Oh, I shouldn't show
my double chin!

169
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:00,453
(laughs)

170
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,455
Um, thank you.

171
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:05,693
Yeah, that's reassuring
to hear you say.

172
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:07,762
(clicking tongue)

173
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,201
(clears throat)

174
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:16,837
(sighs)

175
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:19,974
Okay, thank you
for, um, coming here

176
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:22,510
and, um... or, well,
I'm coming here, but...

177
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,979
thank you for sharing
your spiritual insights with me.

178
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:27,848
I've actually had
one particular burning question

179
00:07:27,882 --> 00:07:30,818
that's just... just been
on my mind for a while.

180
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,720
- Okay, go for it.
- Oh, thanks.

181
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:36,123
What does "vinyasa flow" mean?

182
00:07:36,157 --> 00:07:37,391
Oh.

183
00:07:37,425 --> 00:07:41,595
Well, that's the term for one
of our classes that we do here.

184
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,531
Oh. That's cool.

185
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:44,565
I didn't know that.

186
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:47,268
Um, okay, so there's
actually another one.

187
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:51,072
It's this, uh,
this phrase that you say

188
00:07:51,105 --> 00:07:54,141
when we're in the downward dog
in class,

189
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:55,977
and it sounds really like...
it's kind...

190
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,178
it sounds like it's hard
to pronounce.

191
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:59,747
It's like "ado-mukah-savasna"?

192
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,948
Um, what does that mean?

193
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:01,949
(Heidi chuckles)

194
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:03,184
That's a great question.

195
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:08,823
Actually it means
"downward-facing dog position."

196
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:10,157
That's the words for it.

197
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:11,926
Oh, it just means
"downward dog."

198
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,828
I thought maybe it meant
something more like,

199
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:15,830
spiritual or...

200
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:18,966
No.

201
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,702
It... it's... it actually represents

202
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:23,838
the flow of energy

203
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:25,306
when you do downward-facing dog,

204
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:28,909
and you can only access that
and it's only conveyed

205
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:32,213
through the words
"Adho Mukha Svanasana."

206
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:33,781
Oh.

207
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:35,583
Okay.

208
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:37,785
Um, what are the...

209
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:38,953
Um... is it...

210
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:40,554
It's not English, is it?

211
00:08:40,588 --> 00:08:42,289
Is it an English word?

212
00:08:42,323 --> 00:08:43,657
No.

213
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:45,026
No. No, I don't think so.

214
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:46,627
What are the origins?

215
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,629
- Yoga.
- Yoga.

216
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:49,930
(laughs)

217
00:08:49,964 --> 00:08:51,999
Okay. Oh, sorry.
I meant, what...

218
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:53,100
Sorry, I meant, um,

219
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:54,802
the language,
what language is it?

220
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:56,103
Indian.

221
00:08:57,905 --> 00:08:59,206
Oh.

222
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:01,675
I love India!

223
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:02,676
Yeah, me too.

224
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,677
(laughs)

225
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:05,813
Claire, actually,
you owe some money today.

226
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:06,981
- Oh, I do?
- Mm-hmm.

227
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:10,117
Your membership is due,
and we need to keep it afloat.

228
00:09:10,151 --> 00:09:12,853
Yes, we do. How else
are we gonna run this place?

229
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:15,923
- It's so beautiful.
- I know. It's very beautiful.

230
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:17,124
- I'll pay.
- Before we leave.

231
00:09:17,158 --> 00:09:18,325
- Yeah, we'll do it.
- Okay.

232
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:21,762
We can get back to this now.
I'm sorry. I just forgot.

233
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:22,997
(laughs)

234
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:25,232
So, just in case

235
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:28,269
Heidi didn't give me
the whole truth,

236
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:31,105
I decided to get it
straight from the horse's mouth

237
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:34,708
and go to the Indians!

238
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:37,645
Let's see what we can learn.

239
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,280
Um, yeah, I actually, uh,

240
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:42,249
when I was in college,
I took a...

241
00:09:42,283 --> 00:09:45,186
a little Zen, uh,
not a retreat...

242
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:47,955
I went to a, uh, a temple

243
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:51,258
with, uh, a Zen, um, master

244
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:53,794
or like... not a...

245
00:09:53,828 --> 00:09:55,396
- You know what I mean?
- Mm-hmm.

246
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,297
So it was good.

247
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,265
I... I learned a few things
about that.

248
00:09:58,299 --> 00:10:01,202
So, um, so it sounds
like you're my guy.

249
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:02,736
(laughs)

250
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,904
Namaste. Right?

251
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:06,640
Like, something like that
would probably put you at home.

252
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:08,742
Right?

253
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:10,711
- No.
- No?

254
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:11,812
I don't know much about it.

255
00:10:11,846 --> 00:10:14,949
I did have a moment when I, uh,
I felt like I was one

256
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,750
with the universe,
if that means anything?

257
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:19,753
- I don't know what that means.
- Oh, that's incredible.

258
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:21,722
But um, uh, I...

259
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:23,257
I also think you mean, uh...

260
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,759
I'm a... I'm like,
Native American.

261
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:27,128
You know?

262
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:31,065
I have... I'm 75 percent,
uh, Indigenous.

263
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,401
Like, from, uh, the... the...

264
00:10:34,435 --> 00:10:37,171
Indi... American Ind...
you know...

265
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:39,974
I think you're referring
to the...

266
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:42,877
Southeastern Asian...
Southeast Asians?

267
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:47,114
- No, not Asians. Indians.
- Okay.

268
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:50,017
I... I think you're
a little confused

269
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,019
on... on who you're looking for.

270
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,387
- What do you mean?
- Uh...

271
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,758
I am the one who's
from North America, I suppose.

272
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,026
Yes.

273
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,502
- You're 75% from North America?
- But not...

274
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:03,330
Yes. Yup, yup.

275
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:04,031
Okay.

276
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:08,096
About 70, 70 to 75, maybe 80.

277
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:08,949
I'm so confused.

278
00:11:08,988 --> 00:11:11,380
So there's Southeast Asians,
there's Indians...

279
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,508
And then this is the culture
of North America?

280
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:16,777
Yes.

281
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,889
I really think
I'm missing something.

282
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:23,350
- I think so, too.
- Yeah.

283
00:11:23,384 --> 00:11:25,031
(laughs)

284
00:11:25,088 --> 00:11:26,332
You're not a Buddhist, are you?

285
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,855
Uh, no.

286
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:29,323
I... I've tried

287
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:32,226
to, uh, learn about Buddhism,
of course.

288
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,827
But I... I'm not an expert yet.

289
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:36,797
Okay, but you do have
an area of expertise?

290
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:40,100
- Yeah.
- And it is?

291
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:42,002
Sure. Native American culture.

292
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:43,817
Oh, okay. Oh, okay, I see.

293
00:11:43,864 --> 00:11:46,453
So you're 72% Native American
is what you're saying?

294
00:11:46,508 --> 00:11:47,608
Uh, right. Yes.

295
00:11:47,647 --> 00:11:49,040
Okay, cool.

296
00:11:49,118 --> 00:11:51,011
Uh, some... some people do refer
to it as, uh...

297
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:54,014
I think it's an offensive term
nowadays, "Indians."

298
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:57,117
But, uh, I... I... I think...
I don't...

299
00:11:57,151 --> 00:11:59,220
I'm Indigenous Mexican,
you know?

300
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:00,221
So I'm like...

301
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:02,389
- You're Mexican?
- Yeah.

302
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:04,792
I thought you were
a Native American Indian.

303
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,227
Well, they're the same.

304
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,328
They're very close.

305
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:09,496
- It's all the same, you know?
- What is the same?

306
00:12:09,531 --> 00:12:11,865
I mean, where's it's different,
I suppose like, you know,

307
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,067
Europeans are different,
you know?

308
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,302
- I don't know where that is.
- They're all "white,"

309
00:12:15,336 --> 00:12:16,837
but they're not really,
you know?

310
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,405
Is that offensive,
to say that I'm white,

311
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:20,407
like, to white people,
is that offensive, or?

312
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:22,943
Caucasian? I would say
I'm like a bunch of stuff.

313
00:12:22,977 --> 00:12:24,011
Like, maybe, um...

314
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:26,146
I think I am, like,
one percent Native American.

315
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,381
I didn't realize that this was

316
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,416
a Native American Arts Center,
'cause it said "Indian."

317
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,819
But I do think I'm, like,
one percent Native American.

318
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:33,153
Right.

319
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:35,422
So how much percentage Mexican
are you, then?

320
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:36,290
Uh, a hundred.

321
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:38,359
But you're 75 percent...

322
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:41,929
Oh, I'm 75, uh, yeah,
I'm 72 percent, uh, Native.

323
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:43,297
- Mm-hmm.
- And then I...

324
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,032
oh, from the Americas.

325
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:46,267
And I am...

326
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,304
the rest, I'm mostly,
uh, Spanish, yeah.

327
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:52,940
How are you 75 percent
Native American

328
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:55,142
and 100 percent Mexican?

329
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:56,877
'Cause that's 175 percent.

330
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:00,180
I am 100 percent Mexican, yes.

331
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:02,182
But also 72 percent...

332
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:03,350
My heritage, yes.

333
00:13:03,384 --> 00:13:06,287
And you're not Buddhist.

334
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:08,489
No.

335
00:13:08,523 --> 00:13:11,859
Do I have
any embarrassing moments?

336
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:12,761
No.

337
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,461
No, I actually can't think
of any.

338
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:15,664
I just personally
don't find shame

339
00:13:15,697 --> 00:13:19,400
to be a very useful emotion,
so I kind of block that one out.

340
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:22,537
I don't really...
I'm not gonna lie.

341
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:27,041
I'm feeling like I don't really
wanna keep doing this.

342
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:33,180
But I have to keep going
for the sake of spirituality

343
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,416
and for the sake
of teaching you guys,

344
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:38,586
so that you don't make
the same mistake as me.

345
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:42,389
Point the camera to me.
Get that guy.

346
00:13:43,658 --> 00:13:45,359
- All right, can you hear me?
- Yes.

347
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:47,027
Can you see me?
Are you recording?

348
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:48,596
- Yes.
- You're recording?

349
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,430
- Yes.
- Okay.

350
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:52,499
There's a guy meditating
right there.

351
00:13:52,534 --> 00:13:53,184
Do you see him?

352
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:54,375
I think he's just sitting there.

353
00:13:54,414 --> 00:13:56,003
No, he's meditating.

354
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:58,865
He's probably communing
with God.

355
00:13:58,922 --> 00:13:59,499
Okay.

356
00:13:59,546 --> 00:14:01,509
I don't wanna talk to him.
I'm too nervous.

357
00:14:01,552 --> 00:14:03,132
I'm gonna get across the street,
okay?

358
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:04,411
Okay.

359
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:06,614
- Hi.
- Hi.

360
00:14:06,648 --> 00:14:07,448
Oh, sorry to bother you.

361
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:09,416
Um, someone at
the front desk said

362
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,485
that I could come talk to you?

363
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,088
I, um...

364
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:16,390
Sorry, um,
I'm doing a documentary,

365
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:17,925
um, and I hope this is okay.

366
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,627
I hope you're who
I should talk to about this.

367
00:14:19,661 --> 00:14:22,262
But I wanted to ask
about like, um...

368
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:24,231
Well, you're Indian, right?

369
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:26,233
Well, yes. Yes.

370
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:27,434
Okay. Woo! Thank God.

371
00:14:27,468 --> 00:14:29,637
- Um...
- Thank God, indeed.

372
00:14:29,671 --> 00:14:30,672
Uh, yeah.

373
00:14:30,705 --> 00:14:31,773
Um, so, uh,

374
00:14:31,806 --> 00:14:35,075
I wanted to know if you knew
anything about, like,

375
00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:38,112
mindfulness and, um,

376
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:41,482
uh, like being Zen,
'cause I know in your culture

377
00:14:41,516 --> 00:14:43,417
you're very spiritually
heightened, right?

378
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,919
So I wanted to know
about, like, maybe Buddhism

379
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:49,089
and whatever you know
about spirituality, pretty much.

380
00:14:49,123 --> 00:14:50,324
Uh...

381
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,530
Um, Buddhism...

382
00:14:57,398 --> 00:15:00,367
You wanna know about Indian
or Buddhism?

383
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:04,238
'Cause not all Indians
are Buddhists.

384
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:10,645
(laughs)

385
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:12,514
Um...

386
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:17,151
But I thought Buddha was Indian.

387
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:19,219
Yeah.

388
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:28,462
So the problem is that Anousha
is not Buddhist.

389
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:30,030
- Okay.
- So...

390
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:31,965
So who is?

391
00:15:33,768 --> 00:15:37,204
Could you get
this recycling bin for me?

392
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:38,573
I wanna just get a...
just one shot

393
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:40,474
of this authentic
Chinese writing,

394
00:15:40,508 --> 00:15:42,309
'cause it looks nice.

395
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:46,246
Oh, there's actually
some here, too.

396
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,650
It's like I'm really in China.

397
00:15:52,654 --> 00:15:53,721
This is so fun.

398
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:04,398
So, hey, guys,
it's Claire again.

399
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:07,367
Um, after Earl
so kindly explained to me

400
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:11,472
that Korean people
are not Chinese people, um, ow...

401
00:16:11,506 --> 00:16:14,676
I found
this lovely Chinese temple

402
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:17,645
so I could learn about
Zen Buddhism and mindfulness.

403
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:22,214
So, I'm gonna go see
what that's all about.

404
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:23,912
- Claire?
- What?

405
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:25,299
Come here, sorry.

406
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:26,678
- What's wrong?
- Um...

407
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,514
- Is the camera dead?
- No, no, uh...

408
00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:29,374
What's wrong?

409
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,908
Zen Buddhism isn't really
Chinese, like...

410
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:32,910
You said that you were looking
for a Chinese Buddhist Temple.

411
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,579
But, like,
if you're looking for...

412
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:36,997
Like, Zen is Japanese.

413
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:38,728
Why didn't you say that before?

414
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:39,791
I mean, I'm just
supposed to observe.

415
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,711
But I didn't want you to
be embarrassed again.

416
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:44,755
I don't get embarrassed.

417
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:49,811
Oh, no photo.

418
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:51,813
Sorry, they're closed.

419
00:16:51,846 --> 00:16:53,413
(indistinct)

420
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:54,782
They're closed.

421
00:16:54,816 --> 00:16:55,482
(indistinct)

422
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:58,185
Why the fuck are they closed?

423
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:00,822
Why the fuck are they closed?
Like, it should be open.

424
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:03,725
I'm sorry, I just don't
really feel good right now.

425
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,494
Nothing is going
my way right now,

426
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:09,631
and I'm not even being
selfish about this.

427
00:17:09,664 --> 00:17:14,101
I thought that God was supposed
to help those who help others.

428
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:15,570
It's closed.

429
00:17:15,603 --> 00:17:18,506
- Oh?
- Yeah, just so you know.

430
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,215
Hi, can you... can you please
stop following me?

431
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:29,817
I'm sorry.
Just please stop following me

432
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:31,553
just for like,
one second, please.

433
00:17:31,586 --> 00:17:33,186
I really... I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

434
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,188
I'm really sorry to be mean,
but I just really need

435
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:36,658
alone time for like
five seconds, please.

436
00:17:36,691 --> 00:17:39,459
The goal of spirituality
is enlightenment.

437
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:43,196
And the goal of enlightenment
is to be, like, a super being.

438
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,499
And, that sounds stupid.

439
00:17:47,702 --> 00:17:50,805
It's... the goal of enlightenment
is to be enlightened.

440
00:17:50,838 --> 00:17:53,575
Duh! Could I come up with
a better definition than that?

441
00:17:53,608 --> 00:17:57,612
It's to be beyond your thoughts,
beyond your feelings,

442
00:17:57,645 --> 00:18:00,715
beyond your emotions,
to just be like,

443
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:06,420
a little beam of light
in flesh and bones.

444
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:07,755
That's what I wanna do,
at least.

445
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:10,254
I don't know about everyone else
but that's me.

446
00:18:10,308 --> 00:18:13,010
So let's say
you attain enlightenment.

447
00:18:13,528 --> 00:18:16,858
- Which I'm very close to.
- You're very close to it?

448
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:18,776
- Yeah.
- Okay, so, you...

449
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:20,356
I think so.

450
00:18:20,418 --> 00:18:22,813
- Can you feel...
- I can feel it.

451
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:25,492
- You're close to it?
- I can feel it encroaching upon me.

452
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,737
The enlightenment?

453
00:18:26,808 --> 00:18:27,809
Yeah.

454
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,845
- Okay.
- Yeah, I can see it.

455
00:18:31,923 --> 00:18:33,211
What does it look like?

456
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,381
Hmm...

457
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:36,618
It looks like...

458
00:18:36,651 --> 00:18:40,521
You know when your eyes are shut
and you see your eyelids?

459
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:42,389
Yeah.

460
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:44,892
It looks a little like that.

461
00:18:44,926 --> 00:18:46,226
(bird whistling)

462
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:47,695
Oh, shoot.

463
00:18:50,698 --> 00:18:52,399
Hello?

464
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,869
Guru Bodhidarma?

465
00:18:54,902 --> 00:18:57,672
- How can I help you?
- Oh my God, this is so exciting!

466
00:18:57,705 --> 00:18:59,540
Thank you so much
for calling me back.

467
00:18:59,574 --> 00:19:02,644
Um, so, I am making
a documentary,

468
00:19:02,677 --> 00:19:03,845
as I mentioned to you before,

469
00:19:03,878 --> 00:19:10,283
and I just wanna know everything
you know about spirituality.

470
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:12,720
(clicking)

471
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:16,691
Do it again.

472
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,761
Do not destroy life.

473
00:19:21,596 --> 00:19:23,731
Do not take
what is not given to you.

474
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,467
Do not commit adultery.

475
00:19:27,502 --> 00:19:29,871
Tell no lies, and...

476
00:19:29,904 --> 00:19:33,340
As Guru Bodhidarma gave me
an in-depth explanation

477
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:34,976
of the Ten Commandments
of Buddhism,

478
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:36,110
he also gave me an idea.

479
00:19:36,144 --> 00:19:39,479
While I so appreciated him
giving me a discount rate

480
00:19:39,514 --> 00:19:40,882
for our valuable time together,

481
00:19:40,915 --> 00:19:42,917
I couldn't help but feel
like a Facetime call

482
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,520
wouldn't give me the necessary
hands-on experience

483
00:19:45,553 --> 00:19:46,754
that I was looking for.

484
00:19:46,788 --> 00:19:49,590
So, Bodhi referred me
to a colleague of his

485
00:19:49,624 --> 00:19:51,224
in Los Angeles.

486
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:53,861
Guru Bodhidarma said,
"No adornments."

487
00:19:53,895 --> 00:19:57,999
Um, and his definition of that
was "a thing that adorns,"

488
00:19:58,032 --> 00:19:59,734
which could pretty much mean
anything.

489
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:02,469
Like, that could be a rug
or that could be like...

490
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:04,572
a car buffer
or something like that.

491
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:06,808
So, um, 'cause that's
technically an adornment.

492
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:08,576
So I googled
what "adornment" means,

493
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:13,548
and it's like, accessories,
like earrings, necklaces.

494
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:14,749
Need I go on?

495
00:20:14,782 --> 00:20:16,651
I have like,
a ton of that stuff.

496
00:20:16,684 --> 00:20:19,620
So, I am going to remove it, um,

497
00:20:19,654 --> 00:20:22,523
to follow along
with Guru Bodhidarma,

498
00:20:22,557 --> 00:20:25,258
who came highly esteemed
from Google.

499
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:27,595
So, I should trust him.

500
00:20:27,628 --> 00:20:28,996
Um, yeah.

501
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:35,002
So, um, my grandma taught me
to always make my bed.

502
00:20:35,036 --> 00:20:36,738
And, I do.

503
00:20:36,771 --> 00:20:39,674
But I luckily have a maid
who actually takes care of that

504
00:20:39,707 --> 00:20:41,743
so I don't have to all the time,
thankfully,

505
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:43,511
because that would be
ridiculous,

506
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:46,547
'cause it takes me like,
20 minutes to do it every day.

507
00:20:46,581 --> 00:20:50,484
So, um, yeah, obviously it's
a big bed and I'm all by myself.

508
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:52,486
So, uh... wait a second.

509
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,056
Did Bodhidarma say to...

510
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:57,892
he said no luxurious beds?

511
00:20:57,925 --> 00:21:00,661
Does this count as that,
do you think?

512
00:21:00,695 --> 00:21:02,764
Probably doesn't, though.

513
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:05,465
(sighs)

514
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:06,366
Well, is a luxurious...

515
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:10,571
is a bed luxurious
because of its size, or?

516
00:21:10,605 --> 00:21:12,540
'Cause I guess mine
does accommodate

517
00:21:12,573 --> 00:21:14,407
more than I necessarily need.

518
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:15,543
Um, sorry, no.

519
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:16,811
I shouldn't try to justify it.

520
00:21:16,844 --> 00:21:18,679
I'm trying to do this
the right way.

521
00:21:18,713 --> 00:21:20,982
So I'll just sleep on the floor.

522
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:23,651
Here, I'll take one of these.

523
00:21:23,684 --> 00:21:26,954
Oh, um, no, I'll just do it
without, to be safe,

524
00:21:26,988 --> 00:21:29,090
just in case that counts
as being luxurious.

525
00:21:29,123 --> 00:21:31,092
Okay. Good night.

526
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,861
(groaning)

527
00:21:42,703 --> 00:21:44,437
Oh, sorry.
You're still here.

528
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,073
- You're stepping on my feet.
- Sorry. Sorry.

529
00:21:46,107 --> 00:21:48,341
No, that's okay.
What's up?

530
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:52,604
I think you still have
my mic pack.

531
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,525
But I thought you were staying
on the couch.

532
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:57,993
No, yeah,
but we need the mic pack.

533
00:21:58,052 --> 00:22:00,126
- You want it back?
- Yeah.

534
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,945
But what if we need
to film something?

535
00:22:01,991 --> 00:22:04,069
Not when we're asleep,
I have to charge the battery.

536
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,593
Oh, okay.

537
00:22:05,626 --> 00:22:06,994
I'll give it to you.

538
00:22:08,863 --> 00:22:10,631
I didn't even notice it,
honestly.

539
00:22:10,665 --> 00:22:12,399
It was pretty comfortable.

540
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:14,434
Here you go. Good night.

541
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,633
I think that consciousness
is coming to a point

542
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:49,036
where we're waking up, um...

543
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,004
Sorry.

544
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:52,640
Uh, what was the word
I was looking for? Um...

545
00:22:52,673 --> 00:22:55,009
Oh, a... awareness
is coming to a p...

546
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:58,779
we're in a period of time where
consciousness is waking up.

547
00:22:58,813 --> 00:23:01,515
And where everyone... con...
Fu...

548
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:03,784
Uh, what's the word
for "all together"?

549
00:23:03,818 --> 00:23:04,852
- Where every...
- Collectively.

550
00:23:04,886 --> 00:23:07,021
Collectively. That is the word
I was looking for.

551
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:10,658
I think we're coming
to a period of time...

552
00:23:10,691 --> 00:23:14,461
in, um, this planet's lifespan

553
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:17,932
where collectively we are coming
to an awareness.

554
00:23:17,965 --> 00:23:20,902
I think that most people go
through life completely asleep.

555
00:23:20,935 --> 00:23:23,804
and it's time for us to wake up.

556
00:23:23,838 --> 00:23:25,873
I'm very happy you came here.

557
00:23:26,974 --> 00:23:30,211
Not everyone is willing
to wake up.

558
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:33,413
Yet, everyone is searching
for bliss.

559
00:23:34,548 --> 00:23:35,783
I found you.

560
00:23:36,651 --> 00:23:37,718
What?

561
00:23:37,752 --> 00:23:39,954
I said I found you,
'cause you're right here.

562
00:23:39,987 --> 00:23:41,789
- You know what I mean?
- Impossible.

563
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:45,559
I don't exist.

564
00:23:45,593 --> 00:23:47,460
I am not really here.

565
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:50,631
Neither are you.

566
00:23:50,665 --> 00:23:53,668
Neither is anything.

567
00:23:53,701 --> 00:23:56,604
Everything is a mirage.

568
00:23:56,637 --> 00:23:58,773
Do you understand?

569
00:23:58,806 --> 00:24:01,075
- Yes.
- No, you don't.

570
00:24:02,576 --> 00:24:03,978
How did you know that?

571
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:04,612

572
00:24:04,645 --> 00:24:05,713

00:24:10,017 --> 00:24:11,484
Whoa.

576
00:24:13,754 --> 00:24:15,089
Yeah.

577
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:19,560
Very good.

578
00:24:19,593 --> 00:24:20,594
Yeah.

Let's do it.
How do I do it? Woo!

588
00:24:38,245 --> 00:24:40,147
- Anything. Anything.
- Well, we have...

00:30:10,177 --> 00:30:12,346
All right, guys,
so I found the creek.

710
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:14,415
No, no, no,
you get a shot of the creek.

711
00:30:14,448 --> 00:30:17,318
Get a shot of the creek for them
to see that I found it,

712
00:30:17,351 --> 00:30:19,088
so that they know
that I'm not making it up.

713
00:30:19,143 --> 00:30:20,479
I don't know if I really see it
that well.

714
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:22,356
Okay, all right, then we'll need
to sh... come here.

715
00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:23,658
Do you need me
to hold the camera?

716
00:30:23,692 --> 00:30:27,629
'Cause I really wanna make sure
that they get to see the creek,

717
00:30:27,662 --> 00:30:30,297
'cause I want them to know
that I wasn't lying,

718
00:30:30,331 --> 00:30:34,602
'cause I really did find it,
which I'm very, very proud of.

719
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:37,104
Okay, here.

720
00:30:37,137 --> 00:30:39,940
- Give me... give me the camera.
- No, no, it's okay.

721
00:30:39,973 --> 00:30:43,611
Oh, sorry, yeah, you're right,
it's your camera.

722
00:30:43,645 --> 00:30:46,113
Okay, guys, guys,
do you see this?

723
00:30:46,146 --> 00:30:47,515
Show them the creek.

724
00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:48,750
I literally...

725
00:30:48,783 --> 00:30:52,186
I... I literally found the creek
that she was talking about.

726
00:30:52,219 --> 00:30:53,354
And I thought I wasn't going to.

727
00:30:53,387 --> 00:30:55,657
Like, for a second there
I was on the side of the road

728
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:58,258
and I was like, "I don't know
if I came to the right place."

729
00:30:58,292 --> 00:31:01,261
But, um, this is an incredible...

730
00:31:01,295 --> 00:31:04,398
And she said to follow it
to its source.

731
00:31:04,431 --> 00:31:07,167
So, this probably...

732
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:10,337
I'm sensing to go this way.

733
00:31:10,371 --> 00:31:12,940
(water gently lapping)

734
00:31:12,973 --> 00:31:16,611
Sensing to go this way.

735
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:24,420
- Claire?
- Yeah?

736
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:28,138
So, source, right? Does she mean
where it comes from?

737
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:30,924
Yeah, probably where
it originates.

738
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:34,436
- So you see that waterfall over there?
- Yeah.

739
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:37,856
That's probably...
where it comes from.

740
00:31:37,898 --> 00:31:40,300
- Up this way.
- Why wo... d...

741
00:31:40,334 --> 00:31:42,302
What does the waterfall
have to do

742
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,649
with where it originates?

743
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:45,447
Uh, 'cause it comes from
a high place.

744
00:31:45,489 --> 00:31:48,033
'Cause, you know,
gravity and shit.

745
00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:49,943
Oh, okay. If you...

746
00:31:49,977 --> 00:31:51,211
(screams)

747
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:53,046
If you know the science
behind that,

748
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,448
I'll trust what you have to say.

749
00:31:54,481 --> 00:31:56,383
I personally
have never heard that.

750
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:58,385
But, um, but hey,
this is every much...

751
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:00,722
every bit as much your journey
as it is mine, so.

752
00:32:00,755 --> 00:32:03,011
- And I... I've never said anything like that before,
- Thank you!

753
00:32:03,056 --> 00:32:06,126
so I can already feel
how much this process is...

754
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,729
helping me become...

755
00:32:07,762 --> 00:32:10,130
I almost got, like,
in my head for a second there,

756
00:32:10,164 --> 00:32:13,333
but this... overall this is
helping me become a more...

757
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:14,736
What are you looking at?
What are you looking at?

758
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:16,336
You're distracting me.
Sorry.

759
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,740
I'm becoming
a much more empathetic,

760
00:32:18,773 --> 00:32:21,609
calm, open-minded,
intellectual person.

761
00:32:21,643 --> 00:32:24,646
So I'll trust you.
This is your journey, too.

762
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:26,046
She's amazing.

763
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:27,314
I thought she was like,

764
00:32:27,347 --> 00:32:29,584
really way too cool for me
when I met her.

765
00:32:29,617 --> 00:32:33,521
And I see why now,
'cause she literally is.

766
00:32:37,424 --> 00:32:38,726
(clears throat)

767
00:32:41,195 --> 00:32:43,430
(water rushing)

768
00:32:43,464 --> 00:32:46,066
- Do you hear that fountain?
- It's just... yeah.

769
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:48,168
That means we're close
to the source.

770
00:32:48,202 --> 00:32:49,069
Yeah.

771
00:32:49,102 --> 00:32:51,773
Claire, I don't think
(indistinct).

772
00:32:51,806 --> 00:32:54,057
- What?
- It's been a while now.

773
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:57,110
This is a dead end.

774
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:59,313
Okay, I'm gonna cross.

775
00:33:00,414 --> 00:33:01,081
(screams)

776
00:33:01,114 --> 00:33:04,109
- Dude, did you just see my butt?
- No, sorry.

777
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:06,386
- I mean, yeah, uh, no, good.
- Sorry.

778
00:33:06,445 --> 00:33:08,462
- Wait... wait... wait for me!
- Careful.

779
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:12,059
- Okay, Claire, maybe...
- Yeah?

780
00:33:12,092 --> 00:33:14,228
I see the origin of the creek.

781
00:33:14,261 --> 00:33:15,431
It's right there.

782
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,412
Yeah, but...

783
00:33:16,483 --> 00:33:17,944
- I see the origin.
- It doesn't matt...

784
00:33:18,006 --> 00:33:20,267
- [inaudible falling sounds]
- Okay.

785
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,504
- Let's talk.
- Yeah. I...

786
00:33:22,537 --> 00:33:25,640
We've been at this for a while.

787
00:33:25,673 --> 00:33:27,207
What if...

788
00:33:27,241 --> 00:33:31,445
I don't mean to talk shit
about Bliss, but...

789
00:33:31,478 --> 00:33:32,379
Wait, what the fu...

790
00:33:32,412 --> 00:33:34,649
Sto... I'm gonna have you
stop right there.

791
00:33:34,682 --> 00:33:37,184
Zip. I see the origin
of the creek.

792
00:33:37,217 --> 00:33:39,219
It's right there.

793
00:33:39,253 --> 00:33:41,121
So, here we go.

794
00:33:42,189 --> 00:33:43,591
Whoa.

795
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:46,528
I don't know, man.

796
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:49,613
Is it safe? Are you good?

797
00:33:49,631 --> 00:33:51,983
I think there's basil.

798
00:33:52,068 --> 00:33:54,868
Yeah, I smell it too.

799
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,110
Looks pretty nice over there.

800
00:33:56,169 --> 00:33:58,372
This is beautiful.

801
00:33:58,405 --> 00:33:59,273
(screams)

802
00:33:59,306 --> 00:34:01,341
Bugs! Bugs!

803
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:10,585
Don't follow me.

804
00:34:10,618 --> 00:34:13,353
This is too dangerous for you.

805
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,431
Alright, Claire, hear me out.

806
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:18,458
Yes?

807
00:34:18,492 --> 00:34:20,294
I'm open to suggestions.

808
00:34:20,327 --> 00:34:22,855
- I'm a bit stuck.
- I don't think this is real.

809
00:34:23,196 --> 00:34:24,464
Wait, what?

810
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,817
I don't mean to talk shit
about Bliss yet again.

811
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:28,652
But just let me say this.

812
00:34:28,694 --> 00:34:30,946
What if...

813
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:32,489
She's not here.

814
00:34:32,574 --> 00:34:34,742
No, she's not. She's at
the source of the creek.

815
00:34:34,776 --> 00:34:36,343
What if the source
of the creek's

816
00:34:36,376 --> 00:34:39,112
at the top of a mountain
and it's like way far away,

817
00:34:39,146 --> 00:34:40,247
and she's not here,

818
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,182
and you're not gonna find
the source of the creek,

819
00:34:42,215 --> 00:34:44,351
and she's not gonna respond
to your email.

820
00:34:44,384 --> 00:34:45,753
And...

821
00:34:45,787 --> 00:34:46,654
(sighs)

822
00:34:46,688 --> 00:34:47,655
You know?
Like, what if?

823
00:34:47,689 --> 00:34:50,357
Like, what if she rented out
where she like...

824
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,125
- You know?
- I don't know...

825
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,261
I think there's a bug on me.
I don't know, man.

826
00:34:54,294 --> 00:34:56,229
I don't see the point
of what you're saying...

827
00:34:56,263 --> 00:34:58,666
I'm saying, what if, like,
you're not gonna find her.

828
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,234
I get what you're saying
but I don't know why.

829
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:05,707
She gave me very clear
directions to follow the s...

830
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,241
I don't know why I have
to defend myself to you.

831
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:10,878
You're not defending yourself.
You're... you can... you can...

832
00:35:10,912 --> 00:35:11,813
What is that?

833
00:35:11,846 --> 00:35:13,848
There's so many
weird creatures here.

834
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:15,583
Hold on, hold on.
Listen, listen, listen.

835
00:35:15,617 --> 00:35:17,384
You don't have to...

836
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:19,119
Is that a tadpole?

837
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:22,929
Being honest with yourself
is not defending yourself.

838
00:35:22,953 --> 00:35:24,844
- You're... you're putting me in a position...
- You're not being attacked.

839
00:35:24,907 --> 00:35:25,960
No, you're... listen to me.

840
00:35:25,994 --> 00:35:28,663
You're putting me in a position
where I feel like I have like...

841
00:35:28,696 --> 00:35:30,531
I'm having
a million thoughts a minute

842
00:35:30,565 --> 00:35:32,399
and I need to defend
myself to you.

843
00:35:32,432 --> 00:35:34,936
You're saying just, like,

844
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:37,905
thing after thing after thing
that is incorrect.

845
00:35:37,939 --> 00:35:39,807
But I... and I want
to defend myself

846
00:35:39,841 --> 00:35:41,943
and I want to say,
Bliss is here.

847
00:35:41,976 --> 00:35:43,343
This is legitimate.

848
00:35:43,377 --> 00:35:45,947
She gave me this... advice

849
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,816
to follow the creek
for a reason, but...

850
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,518
but I don't even want to-

851
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:52,887
I don't want to have
to defend myself to you.

852
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,959
This is about me becoming
a bigger and better person

853
00:35:57,992 --> 00:35:59,459
than I was before.

854
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:01,529
This is about me, like...

855
00:36:01,562 --> 00:36:02,697
this is about...

856
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:05,432
this is about me, like, um...

857
00:36:05,465 --> 00:36:09,302
this is about me, like... um...

858
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:10,337
(sniffling)

859
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,839
Sorry.

860
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,242
If you make me
defend myself to you,

861
00:36:15,275 --> 00:36:16,878
that's part of, like,
the old Claire.

862
00:36:16,911 --> 00:36:19,847
That's something that I would've
done, like, four hours ago.

863
00:36:19,881 --> 00:36:22,984
But that's not something
that I would do now.

864
00:36:23,017 --> 00:36:25,620
This has already changed me
and I don't like

865
00:36:25,653 --> 00:36:29,624
that you're pulling me
into that place.

866
00:36:30,649 --> 00:36:32,442
I'm not pulling you
away from change,

867
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:34,030
like, the change
can stay and be real.

868
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,364
Yeah, you're trying...
you're trying to knock me down,

869
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:38,599
- No, I'm not.
- and all my life, people have done this to me.

870
00:36:38,633 --> 00:36:40,735
All my life, all my life,

871
00:36:40,768 --> 00:36:43,336
all my life, people have...

872
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,539
(sniffling)

873
00:36:44,572 --> 00:36:45,707
(water gently lapping)

874
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,576
...they've taken me and they've
tried to make me small

875
00:36:48,609 --> 00:36:50,310
and they've, like,
made fun of me,

876
00:36:50,343 --> 00:36:54,949
and they've torn me down
nine ways from Sunday.

877
00:36:54,982 --> 00:36:58,418
And I just don't...
I don't want that to be you.

878
00:36:58,452 --> 00:37:00,755
We were supposed to have
a special working relationship,

879
00:37:00,788 --> 00:37:04,759
and I wanna find
the origin of this creek.

880
00:37:04,792 --> 00:37:06,761
How 'bout it, everybody?

881
00:37:07,528 --> 00:37:09,362
(rustling)

882
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:10,497
(gasping)

883
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:11,498
Something's rustling.

884
00:37:11,532 --> 00:37:13,034
Hey, guys! Hey, guys! Hey, guys!

885
00:37:13,067 --> 00:37:14,969
Just an ann...
Just an announcement.

886
00:37:15,002 --> 00:37:17,404
- How would you even know that?
- I have my phone.

887
00:37:17,437 --> 00:37:18,506
I could check the steps.

888
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:20,675
I'm sure that we've been walking
for a long time.

889
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:23,544
Oh, well,
aren't you so advanced?

890
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,007
Claire, c'mon.

891
00:37:25,062 --> 00:37:27,548
What?
What... what do you want me to do?

892
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:29,625
It's... she...

893
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:32,154
I don't think this is... maybe...

894
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:33,955
You know what?
I'm h... I'm... I'm feeling...

895
00:37:33,988 --> 00:37:36,423
- What? What were you gonna say?
- Yeah, what were you gonna say?

896
00:37:36,456 --> 00:37:38,325
I'm feeling...

897
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:40,494
like I need to get
something from my car.

898
00:37:40,528 --> 00:37:41,729
I'm feeling like I need a fri...

899
00:37:41,763 --> 00:37:43,731
I need to get something
from my car.

900
00:37:43,765 --> 00:37:47,068
So I'm gonna get something
from my car.

901
00:37:47,101 --> 00:37:49,003
Okay.

902
00:37:49,036 --> 00:37:50,505
Yeah.

903
00:37:50,538 --> 00:37:52,640
(metal jingling)

904
00:38:01,048 --> 00:38:03,684
(traffic rushing)

905
00:38:10,725 --> 00:38:12,359
(gravel crunches)

906
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:23,722
I'm sorry, Claire.

907
00:38:23,771 --> 00:38:24,672
Why are you sorry?

908
00:38:24,705 --> 00:38:27,374
I just have to get something
from my car.

909
00:38:28,609 --> 00:38:30,711
I should probably take off this.

910
00:38:32,613 --> 00:38:33,981
(sniffles)

911
00:38:34,015 --> 00:38:35,616
(groans)

912
00:38:36,651 --> 00:38:38,052
I thought about it
and I realized

913
00:38:38,085 --> 00:38:40,755
that you don't need to go
into a forest

914
00:38:40,788 --> 00:38:42,455
to find enlightenment.

915
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:44,025
No more Buddhas,

916
00:38:44,058 --> 00:38:46,861
no more cultures,
no more retreats.

917
00:38:46,894 --> 00:38:50,865
Just some good,
old-fashioned spirituality.

918
00:38:50,898 --> 00:38:54,434
What could be more spiritual
than spirits?

919
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:56,704
This is friggin' crazy.

920
00:38:56,737 --> 00:38:59,372
I feel so many ghosts here.

921
00:39:01,509 --> 00:39:02,877
I feel like a lot of ghosts.

922
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:03,845
- Do you feel that?
- Yeah.

923
00:39:03,878 --> 00:39:06,147
- You do?
- I don't know. It's creepy.

924
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,480
It feels cold.

925
00:39:07,515 --> 00:39:08,583
(indistinct)

926
00:39:08,616 --> 00:39:11,886
So what's the main concern
for your visit today?

927
00:39:11,919 --> 00:39:14,622
Um, I was hoping
that we could get in touch

928
00:39:14,655 --> 00:39:17,825
with spirits or The Spirit.

929
00:39:18,626 --> 00:39:19,827
Is there someone

930
00:39:19,861 --> 00:39:21,929
that you want to commune with?

931
00:39:22,763 --> 00:39:24,031
Um...

932
00:39:24,065 --> 00:39:26,433
Hmm, no, not in particular.

933
00:39:26,466 --> 00:39:29,402
Do you have any dead relatives?

934
00:39:29,436 --> 00:39:30,805
No.

935
00:39:31,939 --> 00:39:35,442
Well, I... I can't help you there.

936
00:39:35,475 --> 00:39:36,811
Hmm...

937
00:39:36,844 --> 00:39:38,913
Shoot. Well, is there any...
is there any other way

938
00:39:38,946 --> 00:39:40,181
to get in touch with spirit?

939
00:39:40,214 --> 00:39:43,084
Would you like to do
a pendulum reading?

940
00:39:43,117 --> 00:39:45,653
That sounds fun.

941
00:39:45,686 --> 00:39:46,687
Okay.

942
00:39:46,721 --> 00:39:49,891
So you're gonna hold it
with your primary hand.

943
00:39:49,924 --> 00:39:51,959
- Uh-huh.
- Place your hand underneath it.

944
00:39:51,993 --> 00:39:56,831
Okay? You have to relax
your arm entirely.

945
00:39:56,864 --> 00:39:57,999
- Okay?
- Okay.

946
00:39:58,032 --> 00:39:59,734
- Cool.
- Oh, fun.

947
00:39:59,767 --> 00:40:01,102
(laughs)

948
00:40:03,537 --> 00:40:08,542
Good. Um, so we're gonna start
by you just asking a question

949
00:40:08,576 --> 00:40:11,979
to establish the direction
that it's going to be moving.

950
00:40:12,013 --> 00:40:16,083
So, you can start
by asking your name.

951
00:40:16,117 --> 00:40:18,719
Okay.

952
00:40:18,753 --> 00:40:19,820
(sighs)

953
00:40:19,854 --> 00:40:22,390
Is my name Claire?

954
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,062
Oh, whoa.

955
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:31,032
Cool. So front and back is yes.

956
00:40:31,065 --> 00:40:32,033
Wow.

957
00:40:32,066 --> 00:40:33,567
(laughs)

958
00:40:33,601 --> 00:40:35,703
Whoa. It actually works.

959
00:40:35,736 --> 00:40:37,838
Now ask it a "no" question.

960
00:40:37,872 --> 00:40:40,808
Am I fat?

961
00:40:42,276 --> 00:40:43,476
Whoa.

962
00:40:43,511 --> 00:40:44,477
Ooh!

963
00:40:44,512 --> 00:40:46,580
Thank goodness.

964
00:40:46,614 --> 00:40:49,150
- You're definitely not fat.
- That was a close one.

965
00:40:49,183 --> 00:40:50,518
(laughs)

966
00:40:50,551 --> 00:40:51,519
Good. Okay.

967
00:40:51,552 --> 00:40:52,720
Let's just relax that.

968
00:40:52,753 --> 00:40:54,221
- Okay.
- Ask it a question,

969
00:40:54,255 --> 00:40:56,691
something that you would like
to have insight on.

970
00:40:56,724 --> 00:40:58,659
Okay.

971
00:40:58,693 --> 00:41:01,028
Am I gonna be famous?

972
00:41:02,229 --> 00:41:03,888
- Whoa.
- Don't move it yourself.

973
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:04,813
(laughs)

974
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:05,866
I didn't.

975
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,234
- Relax your arm.
- Okay.

976
00:41:07,268 --> 00:41:09,570
Do it again.

977
00:41:09,603 --> 00:41:11,105
Am I gonna be famous?

978
00:41:14,542 --> 00:41:16,744
It's confused.

979
00:41:16,777 --> 00:41:18,980
Why do you wanna be famous?

980
00:41:20,681 --> 00:41:21,983
I don't know why.

981
00:41:23,084 --> 00:41:25,286
Hmm, good, a genuine answer.

982
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:28,055
- I didn't ask it a question.
- It doesn't need a question.

983
00:41:28,089 --> 00:41:31,959
The pendulum responds mostly
on your subconscious thoughts.

984
00:41:31,993 --> 00:41:34,295
I thought I was talking
to ghosts.

985
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:36,764
Spirits come in as they see fit,
but for the most part,

986
00:41:36,797 --> 00:41:38,899
you're just talking to your
inner thoughts and feelings.

987
00:41:38,933 --> 00:41:40,134
Oh, shit.
Can we summon one?

988
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:41,769
You don't have a reason to.

989
00:41:41,802 --> 00:41:43,037
I just wanna talk to one.

990
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,839
Why do you wanna do that?

991
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,509
I don't know,
'cause it'd be fun?

992
00:41:51,846 --> 00:41:54,548
Isn't talking
to yourself enough?

993
00:41:54,582 --> 00:41:55,549
Yeah?

994
00:41:59,353 --> 00:42:01,789
Oh.

995
00:42:01,822 --> 00:42:03,157
That's weird.

996
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,259
I don't know why
it's doing that.

997
00:42:05,292 --> 00:42:07,561
Hmm.

998
00:42:10,931 --> 00:42:12,700
Anything else?

999
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:13,734
Um...

1000
00:42:13,768 --> 00:42:15,336
I'm afraid we're at time.

1001
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:16,637
Oh.

1002
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,039
Hmm.

1003
00:42:19,707 --> 00:42:20,808
Well.

1004
00:42:20,841 --> 00:42:21,976
(brushing teeth)

1005
00:42:22,009 --> 00:42:24,678
And it's really frustrating
to have to waste my time

1006
00:42:24,712 --> 00:42:26,347
talking to someone like that.

1007
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,848
(brushing teeth)

1008
00:42:27,882 --> 00:42:28,983
Anyway.

1009
00:42:29,016 --> 00:42:31,218
Well, good riddance, right?

1010
00:42:31,252 --> 00:42:32,586
So...

1011
00:42:37,124 --> 00:42:40,061
You know what I should do?

1012
00:42:40,094 --> 00:42:42,363
I should go to someone
who really knows something

1013
00:42:42,396 --> 00:42:43,297
about spirituality,

1014
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:46,233
like a spirituality expert
or something.

1015
00:42:46,267 --> 00:42:49,103
- That probably exists.
- Yeah.

1016
00:42:49,136 --> 00:42:52,039
Wow. Well, first of all,
can I just say, I mean,

1017
00:42:52,073 --> 00:42:54,742
for your age and everything
else, that is just...

1018
00:42:54,775 --> 00:42:56,644
that's an amazing sense
of commitment.

1019
00:42:56,677 --> 00:42:58,245
I mean, if I... if...

1020
00:42:58,279 --> 00:43:00,681
if half the young people
in my church

1021
00:43:00,714 --> 00:43:03,684
could even be as committed
to doing this as you are for...

1022
00:43:03,717 --> 00:43:06,287
just for a documentary,
that would be fantastic.

1023
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:10,257
So, um,
what that tells me about...

1024
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:12,059
you asked about spirituality...

1025
00:43:12,093 --> 00:43:15,996
is that some people
are spiritual by nature,

1026
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:17,865
they have
a spiritual connection.

1027
00:43:17,898 --> 00:43:20,301
And the spirit moves them...

1028
00:43:20,334 --> 00:43:23,137
they don't even know it...
um, to do certain things.

1029
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:25,139
So in this case,
you might say

1030
00:43:25,172 --> 00:43:27,274
that the spirit
actually has moved you

1031
00:43:27,308 --> 00:43:30,377
to make a documentary
about spirituality.

1032
00:43:30,411 --> 00:43:32,913
- Isn't that funny?
- Yeah, well, it definitely did.

1033
00:43:32,947 --> 00:43:35,182
I got out
of my 1:30 vinyasa flow

1034
00:43:35,216 --> 00:43:38,018
and I just... it struck me
that I needed to go do this.

1035
00:43:38,052 --> 00:43:39,787
- Wow, that's really amazing.
- Yeah.

1036
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:42,056
Yeah, it wasn't like
a gradual thought process.

1037
00:43:42,089 --> 00:43:43,257
It just hit me
like a ton of bricks

1038
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:44,291
- that I have to go do this.
- Wow.

1039
00:43:44,325 --> 00:43:46,293
So, I think that was the spirit,
according to you.

1040
00:43:46,327 --> 00:43:48,229
That makes sense.
Yeah, absolutely.

1041
00:43:48,262 --> 00:43:51,098
And it comes in all different
forms, all different places.

1042
00:43:51,132 --> 00:43:54,001
Um, so what other kind
of questions do you have?

1043
00:43:54,034 --> 00:43:56,170
Do you think that enlightenment
is possible?

1044
00:43:56,203 --> 00:43:57,838
And what does enlightenment mean
to you?

1045
00:43:57,872 --> 00:43:59,173
Sure. Okay. Enlightenment.

1046
00:43:59,206 --> 00:44:00,374
So, um,

1047
00:44:00,407 --> 00:44:03,043
there's a lot of common
definitions for enlightenment.

1048
00:44:03,077 --> 00:44:05,012
Uh...

1049
00:44:05,045 --> 00:44:08,149
We don't usually use the word
"enlightenment," traditionally,

1050
00:44:08,182 --> 00:44:11,118
but it's just one word
versus another word.

1051
00:44:11,152 --> 00:44:14,054
We might use words like

1052
00:44:14,088 --> 00:44:18,125
"salvation," or,
you know, "Heaven."

1053
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:19,193
Those are the kind of words
that we use

1054
00:44:19,226 --> 00:44:21,462
but basically means
the same thing as enlightenment.

1055
00:44:21,495 --> 00:44:25,032
Obviously, you know a lot about
Eastern religion and culture,

1056
00:44:25,065 --> 00:44:28,235
and that's kind of where
that word comes from.

1057
00:44:28,269 --> 00:44:32,139
But basically,
it's a sense of

1058
00:44:32,173 --> 00:44:37,111
peace and well-being
and belonging.

1059
00:44:37,144 --> 00:44:39,213
That is kind of what
I'm looking for, actually.

1060
00:44:39,246 --> 00:44:40,281
I wanna be happy all the time,

1061
00:44:40,314 --> 00:44:41,882
- pretty much.
- Okay, okay,

1062
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:43,083
so happy all the time.

1063
00:44:43,117 --> 00:44:46,220
That is definitely a big part

1064
00:44:46,253 --> 00:44:48,789
of living in the spirit.

1065
00:44:48,822 --> 00:44:51,225
Nothing feels better than just

1066
00:44:51,258 --> 00:44:53,761
always being surrendered to God.

1067
00:44:53,794 --> 00:44:56,830
Okay, so, if I wanted
to start being happy

1068
00:44:56,864 --> 00:44:57,798
all the time right now,

1069
00:44:57,831 --> 00:45:00,100
I could just surrender
myself to God right now?

1070
00:45:00,134 --> 00:45:02,136
Just by saying I do that,

1071
00:45:02,169 --> 00:45:04,238
and then I'll be happy
all the time?

1072
00:45:04,271 --> 00:45:05,806
Well, it's a process,

1073
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:09,109
but I think once you...

1074
00:45:09,143 --> 00:45:10,778
once you kind of
dip your toe in,

1075
00:45:10,811 --> 00:45:14,114
you realize that
it's much more of a fun,

1076
00:45:14,148 --> 00:45:15,082
enjoyable process.

1077
00:45:15,115 --> 00:45:19,954
It's not something heavy
or that's hard.

1078
00:45:19,987 --> 00:45:21,121
It's supposed to be fun.

1079
00:45:21,155 --> 00:45:23,457
Why would someone want
to be spiritual

1080
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:25,492
if it didn't give them
joy and pleasure?

1081
00:45:26,927 --> 00:45:28,229
I don't see any downside
to this.

1082
00:45:28,262 --> 00:45:30,164
Why doesn't everyone do this?

1083
00:45:30,197 --> 00:45:32,233
I don't know.

1084
00:45:32,266 --> 00:45:34,134
I mean, am I crazy?

1085
00:45:34,168 --> 00:45:36,770
This sounds like
there's nothing...

1086
00:45:36,804 --> 00:45:38,272
Am I missing any questions?

1087
00:45:38,305 --> 00:45:41,108
I mean, so you're saying
enlightenment is possible.

1088
00:45:41,141 --> 00:45:43,010
Yeah, an enlightened
state of being

1089
00:45:43,043 --> 00:45:45,846
is definitely possible.

1090
00:45:45,879 --> 00:45:50,017
I can be in paradise right now

1091
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:52,820
all the time,
right now, pretty much?

1092
00:45:52,853 --> 00:45:55,256
Well, yes, I mean,

1093
00:45:55,289 --> 00:45:58,158
because paradise is... well,

1094
00:45:58,192 --> 00:45:59,893
not right now, right now.

1095
00:45:59,927 --> 00:46:03,430
We don't want you to pass on
tonight, or anything like that.

1096
00:46:03,464 --> 00:46:04,465
(laughing)

1097
00:46:04,498 --> 00:46:07,034
I mean, paradise is...
it's a long journey,

1098
00:46:07,067 --> 00:46:09,136
and it's a good journey, so...

1099
00:46:09,169 --> 00:46:10,838
Wait, I have to die
to get to paradise?

1100
00:46:10,871 --> 00:46:12,973
It's kind of like
the ultimate goal, right?

1101
00:46:13,007 --> 00:46:15,442
Okay, how do we know that
that exists, though, if...

1102
00:46:15,476 --> 00:46:18,912
I mean, 'cause who could
report on it if no one's ever

1103
00:46:18,946 --> 00:46:20,582
come back from the dead, right?

1104
00:46:20,615 --> 00:46:22,316
Some people have died

1105
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:24,418
and have things to say about it
after the fact.

1106
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:27,522
There's all kinds of things
that you could study and learn.

1107
00:46:27,555 --> 00:46:29,156
People have died
and come back from the dead

1108
00:46:29,189 --> 00:46:31,925
- and talked about it?
- Yes, mm-hmm.

1109
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:34,928
How do they... how do we know
if they're lying?

1110
00:46:34,962 --> 00:46:38,198
It's, um, it's okay
to have doubt.

1111
00:46:38,232 --> 00:46:40,034
We all have doubts all the time.

1112
00:46:40,067 --> 00:46:41,536
- Uh-huh.
- And, um,

1113
00:46:41,569 --> 00:46:44,471
actually,
if we didn't have doubt,

1114
00:46:44,506 --> 00:46:47,074
we would never have certainty.

1115
00:46:47,107 --> 00:46:49,476
It's like there's two sides
to every coin.

1116
00:46:49,511 --> 00:46:53,013
So, when you have doubt,
you study, you learn,

1117
00:46:53,047 --> 00:46:55,949
you grow in your relationship
with the spirit

1118
00:46:55,983 --> 00:46:58,285
until you have certainty
and peace,

1119
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:02,990
and you know
that someday... not now...

1120
00:47:03,023 --> 00:47:05,593
after you die,
then you'll be in paradise.

1121
00:47:06,393 --> 00:47:08,262
Hm.

1122
00:47:08,295 --> 00:47:10,964
This sounds like a long shot.

1123
00:47:10,998 --> 00:47:15,869
Well, we don't like
to think of it as a long shot.

1124
00:47:15,903 --> 00:47:18,138
As long as you don't rush there
on purpose or anything,

1125
00:47:18,172 --> 00:47:19,541
you'll be good.

1126
00:47:19,574 --> 00:47:21,208
Yeah, you don't wanna do that.

1127
00:47:22,176 --> 00:47:25,112
Have you... do you know
someone who's done that?

1128
00:47:25,145 --> 00:47:26,447
Oh, well, um,

1129
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,016
I shouldn't joke about
anything like that.

1130
00:47:29,049 --> 00:47:31,919
- Life is very precious.
- Right.

1131
00:47:31,952 --> 00:47:36,558
If anyone is tempted
to end their life

1132
00:47:36,591 --> 00:47:41,195
before the spirit's timing,

1133
00:47:41,228 --> 00:47:43,565
it kinda cancels out...

1134
00:47:43,598 --> 00:47:45,633
it kinda cancels out
all the good stuff.

1135
00:47:45,667 --> 00:47:49,069
- Wait, what?
- Yeah, yeah, paradise...

1136
00:47:49,103 --> 00:47:52,272
paradise is only for those
who are willing to wait.

1137
00:47:54,074 --> 00:47:56,143
Seems like a lot of clauses,

1138
00:47:56,176 --> 00:47:59,380
and a lot of rules
and regulations in this.

1139
00:47:59,413 --> 00:48:00,447
I mean, I don't know how we

1140
00:48:00,481 --> 00:48:02,182
- know all this.
- No, now you're taking it too

1141
00:48:02,216 --> 00:48:04,686
out of... too far.

1142
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:07,221
Well, this has been really,
really, really, really,

1143
00:48:07,254 --> 00:48:09,022
really good.

1144
00:48:09,056 --> 00:48:10,658
Well, I'm really glad you came.

1145
00:48:10,692 --> 00:48:13,994
Actually, we have programs
every night at 7:00.

1146
00:48:14,027 --> 00:48:18,098
And then one the weekends,
we have things at

1147
00:48:18,132 --> 00:48:19,266
2:00, at 4:00, and at 6:00

1148
00:48:19,299 --> 00:48:22,002
- on Saturday and Sunday.
- Okay, I'll remember that.

1149
00:48:22,035 --> 00:48:23,971
All right, yeah.

1150
00:48:24,004 --> 00:48:25,540
(traffic passing)

1151
00:48:25,573 --> 00:48:28,475
I don't know how I didn't
see that one coming.

1152
00:48:30,177 --> 00:48:31,912
I got a free Bible.

1153
00:48:34,114 --> 00:48:35,650
I suffer.

1154
00:48:38,018 --> 00:48:39,554
I do.

1155
00:48:39,587 --> 00:48:42,657
Do I suffer
more than the average person?

1156
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:45,225
Yeah, probably.

1157
00:48:45,259 --> 00:48:49,196
Talking about it is kind of
bringing me to that place.

1158
00:48:49,229 --> 00:48:51,231
Of suffering?

1159
00:48:55,302 --> 00:48:57,404
That's why I like to

1160
00:48:57,438 --> 00:48:59,106
make jokes and laugh,

1161
00:48:59,139 --> 00:49:02,309
and put on this mask,

1162
00:49:02,342 --> 00:49:03,977
be someone that I'm not,

1163
00:49:04,011 --> 00:49:06,079
'cause I think if I was
actually my true self,

1164
00:49:06,113 --> 00:49:09,751
I would probably be smiling
like 50 percent less.

1165
00:49:09,784 --> 00:49:11,519
And no one really
knows what's going on

1166
00:49:11,553 --> 00:49:13,353
underneath the surface of me.

1167
00:49:13,387 --> 00:49:14,388
They see Claire,
and they're like,

1168
00:49:14,421 --> 00:49:16,223
"Oh, that's such...

1169
00:49:16,256 --> 00:49:18,125
that's such a happy girl.

1170
00:49:18,158 --> 00:49:21,629
She posts these pictures
on Instagram,

1171
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:25,232
and she eats these, like,
fancy lunches,

1172
00:49:25,265 --> 00:49:28,703
and her family
takes care of her."

1173
00:49:28,736 --> 00:49:32,372
But no one really thinks
about who Claire is,

1174
00:49:32,406 --> 00:49:33,608
you know, like, as a person.

1175
00:49:33,641 --> 00:49:38,011
No one really thinks about
what I'm actually going through,

1176
00:49:38,045 --> 00:49:41,448
and how anxiety is

1177
00:49:41,482 --> 00:49:44,117
on the inside.

1178
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:47,054
And it doesn't always
show, necessarily.

1179
00:49:47,654 --> 00:49:49,448
Why are you anxious?

1180
00:49:50,525 --> 00:49:54,261
Because of the human condition.

1181
00:49:54,294 --> 00:49:57,130
You know who I actually
can't stop thinking about,

1182
00:49:57,164 --> 00:49:58,666
is that, like, psychic girl...

1183
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,635
if she was psychic,
I don't actually know...

1184
00:50:00,668 --> 00:50:03,538
but the one who did
the pendulum reading with me,

1185
00:50:03,571 --> 00:50:07,575
because I feel like
she was just so,

1186
00:50:07,609 --> 00:50:10,678
so intense, and I haven't been
able to stop thinking about it.

1187
00:50:10,712 --> 00:50:13,046
But I realize
that maybe the reason

1188
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,749
that I don't like her...

1189
00:50:14,782 --> 00:50:17,752
although I love everyone,
I love girls, you know,

1190
00:50:17,785 --> 00:50:20,354
no women shame,
or anything like that...

1191
00:50:20,387 --> 00:50:23,323
but the reason
that I don't like her...

1192
00:50:23,357 --> 00:50:25,292
I mean, sorry, sorry.

1193
00:50:25,325 --> 00:50:26,226
It's not that I don't like her,

1194
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:28,295
it's that I actually...

1195
00:50:28,328 --> 00:50:32,299
I didn't like my subconscious,
which is what she brought up.

1196
00:50:32,332 --> 00:50:35,302
So, I'm gonna get rid of it.

1197
00:50:35,335 --> 00:50:38,238
Well, here's the thing,
from my perspective,

1198
00:50:38,272 --> 00:50:40,307
there is no subconscious,

1199
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:44,411
because we are all made
of the same material.

1200
00:50:44,444 --> 00:50:46,413
Think of the stars, Claire.

1201
00:50:46,446 --> 00:50:49,349
You are made of the stars,

1202
00:50:49,383 --> 00:50:51,318
because stars are essentially

1203
00:50:51,351 --> 00:50:55,455
giant energy cells,
giant nuclei,

1204
00:50:55,489 --> 00:50:57,491
and we're all
made of little cells

1205
00:50:57,525 --> 00:50:59,393
with stars inside of them.

1206
00:50:59,426 --> 00:51:02,597
You see, we are made of
electrons and neutrons,

1207
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:03,798
and that's the same as stars,

1208
00:51:03,831 --> 00:51:07,869
except they're multiplied
by a billion.

1209
00:51:07,902 --> 00:51:11,873
We are... Stars are
an amalgamation

1210
00:51:11,906 --> 00:51:14,207
of all of the same
materials as us.

1211
00:51:14,241 --> 00:51:15,877
Okay, so, would you say that

1212
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:18,111
some people are stardust,

1213
00:51:18,145 --> 00:51:21,883
but other people are just stars,
in and of themselves?

1214
00:51:21,916 --> 00:51:24,484
Well...

1215
00:51:24,519 --> 00:51:27,855
if one is, all are.

1216
00:51:27,889 --> 00:51:29,891
Hm.

1217
00:51:29,924 --> 00:51:32,627
So, my subconscious
doesn't exist

1218
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:35,495
because it's stardust?

1219
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:38,633
Essentially, yes.

1220
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:42,704
You can't get rid of something
that doesn't exist.

1221
00:51:42,737 --> 00:51:45,573
Okay, what about my thoughts?

1222
00:51:45,607 --> 00:51:49,376
Mm-hmm, well, good question.

1223
00:51:49,409 --> 00:51:50,645
Here's the thing.

1224
00:51:50,678 --> 00:51:52,680
Have you ever seen one?

1225
00:51:52,714 --> 00:51:54,649
Have you ever tasted one?

1226
00:51:54,682 --> 00:51:56,584
So they don't exist?

1227
00:51:56,618 --> 00:52:00,387
It doesn't mean
that they don't feel real.

1228
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,757
So, how...

1229
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:03,958
so, how do you
let go of suffering?

1230
00:52:03,992 --> 00:52:07,260
You just don't feel it
because it doesn't exist?

1231
00:52:07,294 --> 00:52:10,163
It's... yes, it's actually

1232
00:52:10,197 --> 00:52:13,801
fairly simple
to not feel suffering.

1233
00:52:13,835 --> 00:52:16,303
So, how do you do it,
just through like yoga,

1234
00:52:16,336 --> 00:52:18,171
or meditating or being vegan?

1235
00:52:18,205 --> 00:52:19,107
How do you do it?

1236
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:21,576
I actually don't have
to do anything,

1237
00:52:21,609 --> 00:52:24,679
because I'm not separate
from the whole.

1238
00:52:24,712 --> 00:52:28,248
Well, so I shouldn't
just do yoga?

1239
00:52:28,281 --> 00:52:29,817
You can, if you enjoy it.

1240
00:52:29,851 --> 00:52:34,221
But, never forget,
it's not you doing it,

1241
00:52:34,254 --> 00:52:36,456
it's the stars.

1242
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:37,759
Okay!

1243
00:52:39,393 --> 00:52:40,695
- Wow.
- Mm.

1244
00:52:40,728 --> 00:52:43,263
Wow, this is insightful stuff.

1245
00:52:43,296 --> 00:52:46,567
Good, I'm glad I can be
of some assistance.

1246
00:52:46,601 --> 00:52:48,936
I loved Zilmar,

1247
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:52,205
so I wanted to go deeper
into what he was talking about,

1248
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:53,975
so I found this guy,
and he's in the same

1249
00:52:54,008 --> 00:52:57,945
field of study as Zilmar,
and, ahh!

1250
00:52:57,979 --> 00:53:00,982
I'm so excited,
I'm so excited to talk to him.

1251
00:53:01,015 --> 00:53:03,751
Him and Zilmar,
they never studied together,

1252
00:53:03,785 --> 00:53:06,587
but they do
the same sort of thing.

1253
00:53:06,621 --> 00:53:07,588
So, I'm just so stoked.

1254
00:53:07,622 --> 00:53:11,291
I wanna learn everything
about Zilmar's field

1255
00:53:11,324 --> 00:53:12,827
of spirituality.

1256
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,262
Have you ever
looked at the stars?

1257
00:53:15,295 --> 00:53:17,799
Yeah, actually, I have!

1258
00:53:17,832 --> 00:53:19,600
Those flickering lights
in the sky

1259
00:53:19,634 --> 00:53:20,768
that really don't exist,

1260
00:53:20,802 --> 00:53:22,737
but I'm just gonna
use this concept

1261
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:24,839
just so you can understand.

1262
00:53:24,872 --> 00:53:27,008
When you look at the stars,
you're not looking at something

1263
00:53:27,041 --> 00:53:29,811
that is happening
in the moment right now.

1264
00:53:29,844 --> 00:53:31,813
You're looking at
the explosions of stars

1265
00:53:31,846 --> 00:53:34,615
millions and billions
of years ago.

1266
00:53:34,649 --> 00:53:36,617
And when we see
the death of stars,

1267
00:53:36,651 --> 00:53:39,453
they could be turning
into black holes.

1268
00:53:39,486 --> 00:53:43,825
And black holes, they have
such a strong gravitational pull

1269
00:53:43,858 --> 00:53:47,028
that they suck in everything
that's around them.

1270
00:53:47,061 --> 00:53:49,997
It could be
asteroids, planets,

1271
00:53:50,031 --> 00:53:52,265
maybe even planets
similar to our own

1272
00:53:52,299 --> 00:53:53,668
that have life,

1273
00:53:53,701 --> 00:53:56,604
even civilization
similar to ours.

1274
00:53:56,637 --> 00:54:00,340
And they're just gone,
like that.

1275
00:54:00,373 --> 00:54:02,610
Do you have Audible?

1276
00:54:04,377 --> 00:54:07,648
(vocalizing)

1277
00:54:07,682 --> 00:54:09,282
(strumming)

1278
00:54:09,316 --> 00:54:10,551
Hey, Earl,

1279
00:54:10,585 --> 00:54:13,054
I'm not down.

1280
00:54:13,087 --> 00:54:18,960
I'm just being

1281
00:54:18,993 --> 00:54:21,062
what I am,

1282
00:54:21,095 --> 00:54:24,031
or what I'm

1283
00:54:24,065 --> 00:54:25,365
not.

1284
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:32,673
(sighing)

1285
00:54:32,707 --> 00:54:35,342
(strumming ukulele)

1286
00:54:38,513 --> 00:54:39,847
You know what?

1287
00:54:39,881 --> 00:54:43,584
This is pointless,
so I'm just gonna put this here.

1288
00:54:43,618 --> 00:54:46,587
Just gonna take a little nap.

1289
00:54:46,621 --> 00:54:49,791
Just gonna take
a little nap right here.

1290
00:54:51,124 --> 00:54:54,503
Did what Guru Ben tell you
kinda mess you up?

1291
00:54:55,495 --> 00:54:57,011
- Who?
- Guru Ben.

1292
00:54:57,066 --> 00:54:59,867
No, no, I wasn't even
thinking about him.

1293
00:55:01,602 --> 00:55:03,871
I am

1294
00:55:03,905 --> 00:55:07,374
more spiritual than ever.

1295
00:55:07,407 --> 00:55:08,810
(sighs)

1296
00:55:12,847 --> 00:55:15,616
- And letting go.
- Heidi did up my

1297
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:17,585
yoga membership after that day.

1298
00:55:17,618 --> 00:55:19,020
It does kind of
irk me a little bit

1299
00:55:19,053 --> 00:55:22,690
that I might be paying
a different membership fee

1300
00:55:22,723 --> 00:55:25,458
than other people are paying,

1301
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:26,794
especially Stream,

1302
00:55:26,828 --> 00:55:29,396
but I don't mind.

1303
00:55:31,566 --> 00:55:33,768
On this next leg of my journey,

1304
00:55:33,801 --> 00:55:36,637
I'm going to meet
with my old friend Stream

1305
00:55:36,671 --> 00:55:37,839
from yoga class.

1306
00:55:37,872 --> 00:55:40,107
Yeah, I would say Stream's
really, really spiritual,

1307
00:55:40,141 --> 00:55:42,076
and I'm gonna learn
a lot from her.

1308
00:55:42,109 --> 00:55:43,744
She always, um...

1309
00:55:43,778 --> 00:55:45,913
she always runs after me
after yoga class,

1310
00:55:45,947 --> 00:55:47,215
and she's like, "Claire, hey!"

1311
00:55:47,248 --> 00:55:51,384
And she usually tells me about
whatever thing she's been doing,

1312
00:55:51,418 --> 00:55:54,155
that whatever phase
she's going through.

1313
00:55:54,188 --> 00:55:57,424
Usually,
she talks to me about it.

1314
00:55:57,457 --> 00:55:58,893
You know what?
She's really weird.

1315
00:55:58,926 --> 00:56:01,996
She's like really, really,
really weird, honestly.

1316
00:56:02,029 --> 00:56:02,997
She smells bad,

1317
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:07,400
and she, um, has a moustache,
which is fine!

1318
00:56:07,434 --> 00:56:09,003
It's fine if you
have a moustache,

1319
00:56:09,036 --> 00:56:10,403
but hers doesn't look good.

1320
00:56:11,572 --> 00:56:12,707
Come in.

1321
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,809
Don't be shy, I don't bite.

1322
00:56:16,878 --> 00:56:19,046
Today, we're takin'
a trip to Topanga Canyon

1323
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,749
to go see my friend Stream.

1324
00:56:21,782 --> 00:56:24,552
Stream is...

1325
00:56:24,585 --> 00:56:27,188
a little off-putting,
so don't be scared.

1326
00:56:27,221 --> 00:56:29,657
I'm gonna take
good care of y'all.

1327
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:33,127
I'm gonna... y'all, Southern,
my Southern roots comin' out.

1328
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:36,898
I don't have Southern roots,
but everyone does a little bit.

1329
00:56:36,931 --> 00:56:40,034
But, um, yep,
goin' to Topanga Canyon,

1330
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:41,501
talkin' to our friend Stream.

1331
00:56:41,535 --> 00:56:43,004
I'm still doin'
this Southern accent.

1332
00:56:43,037 --> 00:56:44,839
I don't know why
I'm still doin' this.

1333
00:56:44,872 --> 00:56:46,473
Sometimes it just
gets the best of me,

1334
00:56:46,507 --> 00:56:49,110
you know how it is.

1335
00:56:49,143 --> 00:56:49,777
I'm so excited.

1336
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:50,711
I'm really excited to just

1337
00:56:50,745 --> 00:56:53,781
go talk to someone
that I actually know.

1338
00:56:53,814 --> 00:56:54,882
Oh, my God,
I thought the elevator

1339
00:56:54,916 --> 00:56:56,651
just broke for a second.

1340
00:56:56,684 --> 00:56:58,219
Going to see Stream.

1341
00:56:58,252 --> 00:56:59,820
Going to see Stream!

1342
00:56:59,854 --> 00:57:01,555
Going to see Stream.

1343
00:57:01,589 --> 00:57:02,957
Going to see Stream!

1344
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:05,192
Going to... oh, what's that?

1345
00:57:05,226 --> 00:57:07,194
I just got a message.

1346
00:57:12,867 --> 00:57:14,135
Never mind.

1347
00:57:17,271 --> 00:57:20,007
Um, I forgot I have
something else to do.

1348
00:57:20,041 --> 00:57:21,242
I mean, she just cancelled,

1349
00:57:21,275 --> 00:57:23,978
but I have something
else to do, so.

1350
00:57:26,147 --> 00:57:27,447
Yeah.

1351
00:57:29,684 --> 00:57:32,687
(elevator opening)

1352
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,487
You ready?

1353
00:57:34,522 --> 00:57:36,791
Going back up this way.

1354
00:57:41,295 --> 00:57:43,130
So, change of plans.

1355
00:57:43,164 --> 00:57:46,901
Stream just sent... I...
I didn't read the message yet.

1356
00:57:46,934 --> 00:57:48,736
Sorry, this didn't go.

1357
00:57:48,769 --> 00:57:50,938
I haven't read the message,
but I'm sure she has

1358
00:57:50,972 --> 00:57:53,774
a very valid reason
for cancelling.

1359
00:57:55,676 --> 00:57:58,813
"Hey, hon, got caught up
working on a passion project.

1360
00:57:58,846 --> 00:57:59,880
Can't make the shoot.

1361
00:57:59,914 --> 00:58:02,917
Maybe this WordPress entry
will be of use to you.

1362
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:05,753
08/24 was a great insight.

1363
00:58:05,786 --> 00:58:09,190
Good luck, XX."

1364
00:58:09,223 --> 00:58:10,157
Mm, of course,

1365
00:58:10,191 --> 00:58:13,160
she has lots of
experiences to draw from.

1366
00:58:13,194 --> 00:58:15,129
"08/24:

1367
00:58:15,162 --> 00:58:17,765
Guru Siddhartha was so powerful

1368
00:58:17,798 --> 00:58:19,900
that he could just
knock a person out

1369
00:58:19,934 --> 00:58:22,303
just by looking at them
with eye contact.

1370
00:58:22,336 --> 00:58:24,772
That's how connected
to the source he is.

1371
00:58:24,805 --> 00:58:26,307
He's too much for people.

1372
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,441
He's so powerful

1373
00:58:27,475 --> 00:58:30,878
that he uses his power
to sexually manipulate people

1374
00:58:30,911 --> 00:58:32,113
because they would do anything

1375
00:58:32,146 --> 00:58:34,048
to feel that moment
of bliss again.

1376
00:58:34,081 --> 00:58:36,584
It's so incredible to witness.

1377
00:58:36,617 --> 00:58:39,153
He's a true..."

1378
00:58:39,186 --> 00:58:40,888
...boddisita-va?

1379
00:58:40,921 --> 00:58:42,323
Body-sitivah?

1380
00:58:42,356 --> 00:58:44,892
B... boddisitiva.

1381
00:58:46,327 --> 00:58:49,630
"He's someone who foregoes
ascending to nirvana,

1382
00:58:49,663 --> 00:58:51,866
and instead, is reborn endlessly

1383
00:58:51,899 --> 00:58:55,336
until they have saved
all suffering beings

1384
00:58:55,369 --> 00:58:56,904
from non-enlightenment.

1385
00:58:56,937 --> 00:59:01,008
Their quest is to help
everyone reach nirvana."

1386
00:59:03,778 --> 00:59:05,780
That sounds like me

1387
00:59:05,813 --> 00:59:07,982
with my documentary.

1388
00:59:08,015 --> 00:59:11,252
I don't sexually manipulate
people, but...

1389
00:59:13,988 --> 00:59:16,590
...I kind of sound
like a bodhi-sativa.

1390
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:24,865
My childhood.

1391
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,835
I wanna say it was idealistic.

1392
00:59:27,868 --> 00:59:29,970
I remember it
as being idealistic,

1393
00:59:30,004 --> 00:59:33,374
but I know that it wasn't.

1394
00:59:33,407 --> 00:59:34,575
I can just kind of tell.

1395
00:59:34,608 --> 00:59:37,978
And when I start to scratch
the surface of my memories,

1396
00:59:38,012 --> 00:59:41,916
I know there was a lot going on

1397
00:59:41,949 --> 00:59:46,887
that did deeply traumatize me,
um...

1398
00:59:48,923 --> 00:59:52,927
I don't remember any of it,
but I know it was there...

1399
00:59:54,929 --> 00:59:58,399
...and that sticks
with a person.

1400
00:59:58,432 --> 01:00:00,768
You know, for example...

1401
01:00:00,801 --> 01:00:03,637
well, I don't have a lot
of examples, because I know

1402
01:00:03,671 --> 01:00:05,139
it's repressed memories.

1403
01:00:05,172 --> 01:00:07,041
I don't recall them,

1404
01:00:07,074 --> 01:00:11,078
but they're so deeply rooted
in my psyche.

1405
01:00:11,112 --> 01:00:16,684
So, I can't speak
on this subject much.

1406
01:00:16,717 --> 01:00:19,720
Oh! Coming!

1407
01:00:19,753 --> 01:00:22,056
- Hello.
- Oh!

1408
01:00:22,089 --> 01:00:24,425
- Hi!
- Hi, I'm Earl.

1409
01:00:24,458 --> 01:00:25,359
Hi, Earl.

1410
01:00:25,392 --> 01:00:28,028
- How are you?
- Very good.

1411
01:00:28,062 --> 01:00:30,064
- Am I in the way, or?
- No, no, you're good.

1412
01:00:30,097 --> 01:00:31,664
The place is, you know...

1413
01:00:31,715 --> 01:00:33,842
You're doing a great job.

1414
01:00:34,135 --> 01:00:37,104
It's usually
not quite this, uh...

1415
01:00:37,138 --> 01:00:39,073
Hope it's not, um...

1416
01:00:39,106 --> 01:00:41,045
Can I get you
something to drink?

1417
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:42,473
Uh, yeah, sure.

1418
01:00:42,567 --> 01:00:44,445
Okay.

1419
01:00:44,478 --> 01:00:46,680
So, you're gonna be
filming us...

1420
01:00:46,869 --> 01:00:48,173
- Talking.
- ...talking?

1421
01:00:48,218 --> 01:00:50,595
Yeah. Claire told me to tell you
she'll be here soon.

1422
01:00:50,918 --> 01:00:51,986
Okay.

1423
01:00:52,019 --> 01:00:53,954
Where is this...
is this gonna be shown?

1424
01:00:53,988 --> 01:00:55,156
Is this, um...

1425
01:00:55,189 --> 01:00:59,793
So, did you meet Claire
in college, or, how, what's...

1426
01:00:59,827 --> 01:01:01,162
(inaudible)

1427
01:01:01,195 --> 01:01:02,363
How do you guys know each other?

1428
01:01:02,396 --> 01:01:03,297
- Ooh, that's a sound.
- You don't have to try to be

1429
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:05,199
friendly with him,
he doesn't really care.

1430
01:01:05,232 --> 01:01:07,401
Oh, you're tinkling!

1431
01:01:07,434 --> 01:01:08,936
(laughter)

1432
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:10,237
I'm tinkling?

1433
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:12,072
- Am I peeing?
- That's beautiful!

1434
01:01:12,106 --> 01:01:13,474
That is... that is very...

1435
01:01:13,508 --> 01:01:17,077
- that is very impressive.
- Oh, thanks.

1436
01:01:17,111 --> 01:01:19,413
- I like it.
- Yeah.

1437
01:01:19,446 --> 01:01:20,948
It's very nice.

1438
01:01:20,981 --> 01:01:22,783
Belly-dancing,
belly-dancing, is that?

1439
01:01:22,816 --> 01:01:24,919
Well, I'm not actually
belly-dancing, it's just

1440
01:01:24,952 --> 01:01:27,821
- for me to feel spiritual.
- Okay.

1441
01:01:27,855 --> 01:01:30,357
Okay, well,
she doesn't understand, so.

1442
01:01:30,391 --> 01:01:32,226
- I don't know why I'm here.
- No, I think I do.

1443
01:01:32,259 --> 01:01:33,460
I think spiritual is good.

1444
01:01:33,494 --> 01:01:37,231
I think... I think... you know,
I think that I'm ready to...

1445
01:01:37,264 --> 01:01:38,933
I'm ready to listen,

1446
01:01:38,966 --> 01:01:40,501
whatever you have to say.

1447
01:01:40,535 --> 01:01:42,970
Yeah, we need to talk about
some of the advisors

1448
01:01:43,003 --> 01:01:46,407
you've been talking to
that are helping with your

1449
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,242
spiritual journey.

1450
01:01:48,275 --> 01:01:50,844
That guy in Van Nuys.

1451
01:01:50,878 --> 01:01:52,746
Okay, well, I just wanted to

1452
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:55,115
let you guys know
that I don't need you anymore,

1453
01:01:55,149 --> 01:01:58,385
because your
Western teachings are a...

1454
01:01:58,419 --> 01:02:00,421
a tempting illusion
to distract me

1455
01:02:00,454 --> 01:02:04,425
from my path
as a bodhisativa, so.

1456
01:02:05,492 --> 01:02:08,028
Okay, honey, um...

1457
01:02:08,062 --> 01:02:10,097
We never taught you anything.

1458
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:13,000
We've always
encouraged you to go

1459
01:02:13,033 --> 01:02:18,005
study and explore different...

1460
01:02:18,038 --> 01:02:22,209
Are you being aggressive
because the cameras are here?

1461
01:02:22,243 --> 01:02:25,846
- I'm not being aggressive.
- Okay, okay, right.

1462
01:02:26,914 --> 01:02:29,149
Did you sanitize the...

1463
01:02:29,183 --> 01:02:31,018
you know, it's looking a little

1464
01:02:31,051 --> 01:02:32,286
- infected.
- You're making me wanna

1465
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:33,287
- take it out.
- Okay.

1466
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,155
It's embarrassing,
'cause I just got this,

1467
01:02:35,189 --> 01:02:36,890
and it was a special
thing to do, but...

1468
01:02:36,924 --> 01:02:39,393
Am I saying something
to upset... ooh, sorry.

1469
01:02:39,426 --> 01:02:43,531
Am I saying something
to upset you, or, you know, or...

1470
01:02:43,565 --> 01:02:46,467
It just doesn't seem like you
see the value of what I'm doing.

1471
01:02:48,002 --> 01:02:49,236
I'm going on a really big
spiritual journey,

1472
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:52,172
and it doesn't seem like you
understand spirituality, so.

1473
01:02:52,206 --> 01:02:55,075
Well, is it helping you?

1474
01:02:56,343 --> 01:02:57,579
Yeah.

1475
01:02:57,612 --> 01:02:58,312
That's good.

1476
01:02:58,345 --> 01:03:00,247
That's... that's really good!

1477
01:03:00,281 --> 01:03:02,816
Why are you lying?
Why are you lying to me?

1478
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:07,221
- You don't really think that.
- I just... I said that's good.

1479
01:03:07,254 --> 01:03:09,890
I just don't think
you're ever gonna be...

1480
01:03:09,923 --> 01:03:12,192
Look, you know what?

1481
01:03:12,226 --> 01:03:13,093
When I was in college,

1482
01:03:13,127 --> 01:03:15,829
I studied a lot
of Eastern philosophy,

1483
01:03:15,863 --> 01:03:20,067
and I think it's really
fascinating stuff, I do!

1484
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:23,003
And Buddhism is... it's a...

1485
01:03:23,037 --> 01:03:26,473
it's a very...
it's a very expansive,

1486
01:03:26,508 --> 01:03:30,344
all-encompassing... I mean,
there are many paths, of course,

1487
01:03:30,377 --> 01:03:32,279
with Buddhism, so.

1488
01:03:32,313 --> 01:03:35,215
Which of the philosophies
or paths did you follow?

1489
01:03:35,249 --> 01:03:37,484
Or are you currently following?

1490
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:40,854
Um...

1491
01:03:40,888 --> 01:03:43,057
vinyasa?

1492
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:45,593
What? Honey, that's yoga.

1493
01:03:46,528 --> 01:03:48,095
Oh, honey.

1494
01:03:48,128 --> 01:03:50,197
Oh, sweetheart.

1495
01:03:52,032 --> 01:03:53,033
(sighs)

1496
01:03:53,067 --> 01:03:54,401
Okay.

1497
01:03:54,435 --> 01:03:55,603
What is your end game here?

1498
01:03:55,637 --> 01:03:58,972
I mean, what are you hoping
that this is gonna lead you to?

1499
01:03:59,006 --> 01:04:01,041
I wanna... I wanna

1500
01:04:01,075 --> 01:04:05,513
- enlighten the world.
- And how much does that pay?

1501
01:04:05,547 --> 01:04:07,881
Well, I think it would
probably pay, like, millions

1502
01:04:07,915 --> 01:04:10,451
once I get it out there
and everyone sees it.

1503
01:04:10,484 --> 01:04:13,655
They would become happy,
and then everybody would pay...

1504
01:04:13,688 --> 01:04:17,291
would pay you some money
to learn the answers to...

1505
01:04:17,324 --> 01:04:18,992
to life,
the meaning of life, and...

1506
01:04:19,026 --> 01:04:20,194
Well, they wouldn't
just pay me money.

1507
01:04:20,227 --> 01:04:23,631
They wouldn't just like
donate to some random website,

1508
01:04:23,665 --> 01:04:25,667
but they would pay
to watch my documentary.

1509
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:27,067
- Right.
- Like on Amazon Prime,

1510
01:04:27,101 --> 01:04:28,469
- or something like that.
- Right, right.

1511
01:04:28,502 --> 01:04:30,204
- Amazon.
- Or on Netflix,

1512
01:04:30,237 --> 01:04:33,541
- and I would sell it to Netflix.
- Yeah.

1513
01:04:33,575 --> 01:04:34,743
Okay.

1514
01:04:34,776 --> 01:04:36,977
But you were doing... you were
doing pretty well, finally.

1515
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:37,978
You were gettin' those...

1516
01:04:38,011 --> 01:04:39,681
- those Cs up, and...
- I'm doing well now!

1517
01:04:39,714 --> 01:04:40,582
I'm doing well now.

1518
01:04:40,615 --> 01:04:41,850
I'm doing better now
than I was then.

1519
01:04:41,882 --> 01:04:45,687
You are, yes, I just wanted you
to finish and get your diploma.

1520
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:48,523
- I don't want my diploma!
- That looks so good on a res...

1521
01:04:48,556 --> 01:04:49,858
- I don't want my diploma!
- Okay.

1522
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:53,193
I don't want my diploma, it's
not gonna do anything for me.

1523
01:04:53,227 --> 01:04:54,696
Getting a diploma
has nothing to do...

1524
01:04:54,729 --> 01:04:58,031
Earl didn't ask for my diploma
when he came to work for me.

1525
01:04:58,065 --> 01:05:00,334
Like, it just... I'm not
gonna need the diploma

1526
01:05:00,367 --> 01:05:02,169
when I sell this on Netflix.

1527
01:05:02,202 --> 01:05:04,071
No one cares.

1528
01:05:04,104 --> 01:05:06,473
Right, did you...

1529
01:05:06,508 --> 01:05:09,309
Do you work for Netflix, Earl?

1530
01:05:09,343 --> 01:05:11,445
No? Okay. Um...

1531
01:05:11,478 --> 01:05:13,046
Well, you had talked
about grad school,

1532
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:16,183
and I thought that
that was a really good idea.

1533
01:05:16,216 --> 01:05:18,318
Well, I changed my mind,
I changed my mind, so.

1534
01:05:18,352 --> 01:05:19,987
- Okay.
- Yeah, I don't want grad school

1535
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:21,321
anymore,
'cause I'm doing this now,

1536
01:05:21,355 --> 01:05:23,591
and this is way better
than grad school.

1537
01:05:23,625 --> 01:05:26,059
- Yeah, I don't know, whatever.
- You know what, honey?

1538
01:05:26,093 --> 01:05:29,963
I understand, I know your 20s
is full of so many questions

1539
01:05:29,997 --> 01:05:31,599
- and so much...
- I don't have questions!

1540
01:05:31,633 --> 01:05:33,535
I feel like I have
a lot of answers!

1541
01:05:33,568 --> 01:05:36,203
I have a lot of answers,
and I'm getting all the answers.

1542
01:05:36,236 --> 01:05:38,038
You're getting... and...

1543
01:05:38,071 --> 01:05:41,676
and you're really trying
to find even more answers,

1544
01:05:41,709 --> 01:05:43,477
and you're trying
to change the world.

1545
01:05:43,511 --> 01:05:45,479
When I was in college,
I wanted to go to Africa,

1546
01:05:45,513 --> 01:05:47,347
- and I wanted to stop apartheid.
- Why would you wanna

1547
01:05:47,381 --> 01:05:49,551
- go to Africa?
- Me and five other people.

1548
01:05:49,584 --> 01:05:50,785
There's nothing in Africa,

1549
01:05:50,819 --> 01:05:53,320
- Africa isn't even spiritual.
- And we had zero influence

1550
01:05:53,353 --> 01:05:55,088
on the entire situation.

1551
01:05:55,122 --> 01:05:58,058
It's sort of like,
by the time we got there,

1552
01:05:58,091 --> 01:05:59,993
it had already happened.

1553
01:06:00,027 --> 01:06:01,529
I didn't even hear what
you said you wanted to stop.

1554
01:06:01,563 --> 01:06:04,465
- Why was you... what were you?
- Apartheid in South Africa?

1555
01:06:04,498 --> 01:06:06,668
- It's a...
- I don't know what that is.

1556
01:06:06,701 --> 01:06:10,070
Okay, maybe if you
finish college, then.

1557
01:06:10,103 --> 01:06:12,306
Those are the kind of things
you could find out about.

1558
01:06:12,339 --> 01:06:13,340
So I came here just to get

1559
01:06:13,373 --> 01:06:14,709
- insulted.
- History is very...

1560
01:06:14,742 --> 01:06:15,643
no, sweetheart!

1561
01:06:15,677 --> 01:06:17,411
- No, no.
- No, I did, I did.

1562
01:06:17,444 --> 01:06:20,447
Look, you look beautiful.

1563
01:06:20,481 --> 01:06:22,449
- I don't believe you.
- I'm a little...

1564
01:06:22,483 --> 01:06:25,620
No, I am... I know...

1565
01:06:25,653 --> 01:06:27,387
I know you don't
believe me at this point,

1566
01:06:27,421 --> 01:06:28,523
but I'm just gonna say it.

1567
01:06:28,556 --> 01:06:30,658
You look gorgeous.

1568
01:06:30,692 --> 01:06:32,392
Finally, you...

1569
01:06:32,426 --> 01:06:35,229
you have something that's

1570
01:06:35,262 --> 01:06:37,364
covering most
of your body... I'm not...

1571
01:06:37,397 --> 01:06:41,134
I mean, at least you didn't come
to the front door in a burqa.

1572
01:06:41,168 --> 01:06:42,737
I was very pleased about that.

1573
01:06:42,770 --> 01:06:44,806
Oh, my God, you're acting
like I'm a prostitute!

1574
01:06:44,839 --> 01:06:46,541
And if I was...
I mean, first of all,

1575
01:06:46,574 --> 01:06:48,075
that would be my choice,
so it wouldn't...

1576
01:06:48,108 --> 01:06:50,444
Well, a burqa, you know...

1577
01:06:51,713 --> 01:06:53,347
Never mind.

1578
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:56,718
I think that, uh...

1579
01:06:56,751 --> 01:06:57,819
(sighs)

1580
01:06:57,852 --> 01:07:01,623
I think that we need
to have more...

1581
01:07:01,656 --> 01:07:05,392
I love this communication, I do.

1582
01:07:05,425 --> 01:07:08,161
And I will do my part,
and I will listen more.

1583
01:07:08,195 --> 01:07:10,832
Okay? I will, I will!

1584
01:07:10,865 --> 01:07:13,367
And you know what?
If Dad's not here, we will...

1585
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,702
we will do
the FaceTime with him.

1586
01:07:14,736 --> 01:07:17,437
I don't wanna FaceTime Dad.

1587
01:07:17,471 --> 01:07:18,573
Honestly, I don't even
wanna be here.

1588
01:07:18,606 --> 01:07:20,808
Can we... can we wrap this, Earl?

1589
01:07:20,842 --> 01:07:22,577
I don't wanna talk...
I don't...

1590
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:24,456
I feel like
I'm getting insulted, so.

1591
01:07:24,503 --> 01:07:27,214
I'll get some, uh...

1592
01:07:27,256 --> 01:07:29,967
Some B shots, I'll get some...
some, yeah.

1593
01:07:30,518 --> 01:07:31,853
I didn't come here...

1594
01:07:31,886 --> 01:07:35,489

1595
01:07:35,523 --> 01:07:37,391
That might help you, you know.

1596
01:07:37,424 --> 01:07:40,728
I do sometimes worry about

1597
01:07:40,762 --> 01:07:41,663
your depression.

1598
01:07:41,696 --> 01:07:45,198
Sweetheart, I love you so much.

1599
01:07:45,232 --> 01:07:47,367
I do, I do.

1600
01:07:47,401 --> 01:07:51,506
We wouldn't have this
conversation if I didn't.

1601
01:07:51,539 --> 01:07:53,675
It's just that I...

1602
01:07:53,708 --> 01:07:56,343
I don't want you to be
taken advantage of.

1603
01:07:56,376 --> 01:07:58,513
I want you to find
those answers, I do.

1604
01:07:58,546 --> 01:08:00,715
I want you to find
those answers.

1605
01:08:00,748 --> 01:08:03,851
I'm just wondering if you're
asking the right questions.

1606
01:08:05,319 --> 01:08:06,688
I would say so.

1607
01:08:07,387 --> 01:08:09,791
(soft whirring)

1608
01:08:12,359 --> 01:08:16,330
I don't know why she acts like

1609
01:08:16,363 --> 01:08:17,765
she's being so nice, you know?

1610
01:08:17,799 --> 01:08:19,499
That's the thing
that makes me the most mad.

1611
01:08:19,534 --> 01:08:23,203
If she was just upfront
about what she thought,

1612
01:08:23,236 --> 01:08:26,273
I wouldn't even be mad at her,
because

1613
01:08:26,306 --> 01:08:27,909
at least she would be saying
what's on her mind.

1614
01:08:27,942 --> 01:08:30,477
But instead, it's like
she's really passive aggressive

1615
01:08:30,511 --> 01:08:31,779
and she lies to me,

1616
01:08:31,813 --> 01:08:34,649
and she acts like
she's so friendly for you,

1617
01:08:34,682 --> 01:08:37,451
and she offers you cookies,
and she's so nice.

1618
01:08:37,484 --> 01:08:38,753
But...

1619
01:08:40,688 --> 01:08:42,389
That's the thing that bothers me

1620
01:08:42,422 --> 01:08:47,260
is that if she was just honest,
I wouldn't even care, you know?

1621
01:08:47,294 --> 01:08:49,429
(sniffling)

1622
01:08:49,463 --> 01:08:50,397
But she just pretends,

1623
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:52,199
and she pretends
like she's on my side,

1624
01:08:52,232 --> 01:08:53,067
but I know she's not.

1625
01:08:53,101 --> 01:08:55,435
I look at her,
and I'm like, "Why?"

1626
01:08:55,469 --> 01:08:57,204
I said, you heard me,
I was like,

1627
01:08:57,237 --> 01:08:58,171
"Why are you lying to me?"

1628
01:08:58,205 --> 01:08:59,741
And that's actually
what it feels like.

1629
01:08:59,774 --> 01:09:01,809
It's like,
"Why are you lying to me?

1630
01:09:01,843 --> 01:09:03,310
You don't believe
in what I'm doing,

1631
01:09:03,343 --> 01:09:06,681
You never have,
that's fine, just tell me,

1632
01:09:06,714 --> 01:09:08,950
instead of patronizing me
and making me feel like

1633
01:09:08,983 --> 01:09:11,886
a stupid little kid."

1634
01:09:11,919 --> 01:09:14,555
(water beating)

1635
01:09:19,259 --> 01:09:22,563
She didn't even like all this,
and I knew she wouldn't,

1636
01:09:22,597 --> 01:09:24,464
but she pretended to.

1637
01:09:24,498 --> 01:09:25,800
She pretended to be nice

1638
01:09:25,833 --> 01:09:29,469
'cause the cameras were there,
obviously, so.

1639
01:09:29,503 --> 01:09:31,939
(dryer whooshing)

1640
01:09:33,808 --> 01:09:36,678
I think that feeling the need
to express your spirituality

1641
01:09:36,711 --> 01:09:38,946
comes from a place of, um,

1642
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:41,916
deep-rooted longing and feeling
like you need validation,

1643
01:09:41,949 --> 01:09:43,685
and needing to be
loved by others,

1644
01:09:43,718 --> 01:09:48,455
and need to show
instead of do

1645
01:09:48,488 --> 01:09:50,457
with quiet confidence,

1646
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:51,959
like me.

1647
01:09:51,993 --> 01:09:54,762
Well, no, I was
calling because I'm...

1648
01:10:00,034 --> 01:10:00,668
This sounds stupid,

1649
01:10:00,702 --> 01:10:02,770
but I'm doing really well,

1650
01:10:02,804 --> 01:10:06,007
and I'm feeling really,
really, really spiritual,

1651
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:10,578
and... no, it's not!

1652
01:10:10,611 --> 01:10:13,648
No, it's not like that.

1653
01:10:13,681 --> 01:10:14,882
No, it's...

1654
01:10:14,916 --> 01:10:18,519
The other times, the things
weren't as important to me,

1655
01:10:18,553 --> 01:10:20,021
but this time it actually is,

1656
01:10:20,054 --> 01:10:25,026
and I'm actually doing it
all the way, like I have...

1657
01:10:25,059 --> 01:10:30,031
I have a full camera crew,
and...

1658
01:10:30,064 --> 01:10:31,999
Well, you never...

1659
01:10:32,033 --> 01:10:35,268
you never believed
in what I was doing, so...

1660
01:10:38,405 --> 01:10:41,042
I'm not calling you
to be an asshole!

1661
01:10:41,075 --> 01:10:42,543
Why are you acting like

1662
01:10:42,577 --> 01:10:44,377
I'm about to attack you,
or something?

1663
01:10:44,411 --> 01:10:48,516
I just wanted to... obviously,
I see now that it was stupid

1664
01:10:48,549 --> 01:10:49,650
that I even did this,

1665
01:10:49,684 --> 01:10:51,384

Why would I lie
about my intentions?

1668
01:10:55,056 --> 01:10:58,559
That seems like the most
pointless thing to do.

1669
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:06,299
You don't have to be
talkin' to me right now.

1670

Well, if you actually
wanted to talk to me,

1671

1673
01:11:13,841 --> 01:11:16,577

1674

need you anymore,

about you anymore,

01:15:00,042 --> 01:15:02,169
He's, uh...

1739
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:04,872
He helps people,
he could help me?

1740
01:15:04,905 --> 01:15:07,337
What does he... what do you mean,
like a doctor?

1741
01:15:07,399 --> 01:15:10,677
Yeah, yeah, kinda like a doctor,
he, um...

1742
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,164
He gets drugs, but, like,
good ones, like, um...

1743
01:15:13,214 --> 01:15:15,349
- Like marijuana?
- Like [censored]

1744
01:15:15,390 --> 01:15:16,391
And [censored]

1745
01:15:16,433 --> 01:15:19,014
- And like [censored]
- I've never tried... before.

1746
01:15:19,084 --> 01:15:20,084
Do you wanna?

1747
01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:22,256
Yeah, do you think
it would help?

1748
01:15:23,774 --> 01:15:26,818
I mean, you said ego death,
so it made me think about it.

1749
01:15:28,229 --> 01:15:33,300
Does... have something to do...
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

1750
01:15:33,334 --> 01:15:36,070
Yeah, no, I've I've always
kind of been afraid to try...

1751
01:15:36,103 --> 01:15:38,339
because I've heard that
it could bring out

1752
01:15:38,372 --> 01:15:40,574
any dormant mental illnesses
you have,

1753
01:15:40,608 --> 01:15:43,944
and mine are already
barely dormant as it is,

1754
01:15:43,978 --> 01:15:47,848
so I haven't really wanted
to test that.

1755
01:15:47,882 --> 01:15:51,986
But if it could kill my ego,
then I would definitely do it.

1756
01:15:53,846 --> 01:15:55,389
Let's do it.

1757
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:58,192
Is he alive?

1758
01:15:58,225 --> 01:15:59,737
I don't know why that
was my first thought.

1759
01:15:59,807 --> 01:16:01,052
- Alright, let's do it.
- Is he available?

1760
01:16:01,114 --> 01:16:02,183
Yeah, I'm sure.

1761
01:16:02,263 --> 01:16:04,314
- Really?
- Yeah.

1762
01:16:06,333 --> 01:16:08,202
All right.

1763
01:16:08,235 --> 01:16:11,124
Well, I guess I should put
my bodhisativa outfit on.

1764
01:16:11,210 --> 01:16:13,115
If you, yeah, well, I don't know
if he's available right now.

1765
01:16:13,156 --> 01:16:14,741
But, yeah, we'll...
I'll text him.

1766
01:16:15,276 --> 01:16:17,978
I'm gonna put
my bodhisativa outfit on.

1767
01:16:19,313 --> 01:16:21,982
Bliss does exist.

1768
01:16:22,016 --> 01:16:25,252
Nirvana exists.

1769
01:16:25,286 --> 01:16:29,256
But our brains are
too unevolved to feel it.

1770
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:32,726
Our minds are stuck
in the fourth dimension,

1771
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:36,130
but there's a way
to open up your mind

1772
01:16:36,163 --> 01:16:38,799
and reach nirvana.

1773
01:16:38,833 --> 01:16:43,771
Now, I'm not sayin'
it's gonna last forever,

1774
01:16:43,804 --> 01:16:46,107
but it will change you forever.

1775
01:16:49,777 --> 01:16:52,113
You have to do a lot of...

1776
01:16:55,282 --> 01:16:56,951
It doesn't mean happiness.

1777
01:16:56,984 --> 01:16:59,753
It's closer to

1778
01:16:59,787 --> 01:17:03,090
allowance, acceptance.

1779
01:17:12,299 --> 01:17:15,035
Wow.

1780
01:17:15,069 --> 01:17:18,439
How do I do it?

1781
01:17:18,472 --> 01:17:22,042
We're gonna dissolve it all
into a glass of water,

1782
01:17:22,076 --> 01:17:23,444
and you'll just drink it down.

1783
01:17:23,477 --> 01:17:26,147
Okay, so we put this in water,
and I drink all of it?

1784
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:27,448
- Yup.
- We just put it in wa...

1785
01:17:27,481 --> 01:17:29,783
- Like, we just...
- Yeah.

1786
01:17:29,817 --> 01:17:30,684
Okay.

1787
01:17:30,718 --> 01:17:32,052
And, it's all...
it's all on here,

1788
01:17:32,086 --> 01:17:33,320
this isn't just paper, right?

1789
01:17:33,354 --> 01:17:35,189
- No, no.
- Okay.

1790
01:17:35,222 --> 01:17:36,857
You will see soon enough.

1791
01:17:36,891 --> 01:17:38,926
What does this say on this?

1792
01:17:38,959 --> 01:17:41,328
Om.

1793
01:17:41,362 --> 01:17:45,166
It's the original sound
of the universe.

1794
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:51,338
If you can go prior
to that sound,

1795
01:17:51,372 --> 01:17:53,440
that is where
enlightenment will find you.

1796
01:17:55,042 --> 01:17:57,011
I drink this whole thing?

1797
01:18:07,522 --> 01:18:10,257
Mm.

1798
01:18:10,291 --> 01:18:12,726
Mm!

1799
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:14,762
Good.

1800
01:18:14,795 --> 01:18:16,764
Good.

1801
01:18:16,797 --> 01:18:19,233

1802
01:18:21,802 --> 01:18:23,370
Ah!

1803
01:18:23,404 --> 01:18:25,906
Ah.

1804
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:29,843
And now...

1805
01:18:29,877 --> 01:18:32,012
we await annihilation.

1806
01:18:34,315 --> 01:18:36,016

are like,

"This is an illusion,
this is real,

1809
01:18:42,389 --> 01:18:44,425

this does exist,

1810

1811
01:18:48,829 --> 01:18:49,964
You know?

1812
01:18:49,997 --> 01:18:52,333
Pick a side!

1813
01:18:52,366 --> 01:18:53,867
Correct.

1814
01:18:53,901 --> 01:18:55,336
No.

1815
01:18:55,369 --> 01:18:56,870
Incorrect.

1816
01:18:56,904 --> 01:18:58,439
There is no I.

1817
01:18:58,472 --> 01:19:00,441
There is no you.

1818
01:19:00,474 --> 01:19:02,009
What about me?

1819
01:19:02,042 --> 01:19:03,877
There's no me.

1820
01:19:03,911 --> 01:19:05,479
Well, there might not be a you,

1821
01:19:05,513 --> 01:19:07,982
- but there's definitely a me.
- That's what I'm saying,

1822
01:19:08,015 --> 01:19:10,384
is there's no me.

1823
01:19:10,417 --> 01:19:12,786
- There's no you.
- You!

1824
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:14,021
- You?
- Correct.

1825
01:19:14,054 --> 01:19:16,524
How did this end up
pointing this direction?

1826
01:19:16,558 --> 01:19:18,192
Did you do this?

1827
01:19:20,094 --> 01:19:22,229
When will it kick in?

1828
01:19:22,263 --> 01:19:24,999
About 30 minutes.

1829
01:19:25,032 --> 01:19:26,867
How could you understand
something that

1830
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:29,903
cannot be understood?

1831
01:19:29,937 --> 01:19:32,373
(echoing, maniacal laughter)

1832
01:19:34,609 --> 01:19:36,944
- I don't wanna die.
- You must fall.

1833
01:19:36,977 --> 01:19:38,879
- I don't wanna die.
- Die!

1834
01:19:38,912 --> 01:19:40,180
It's creepy... no!

1835
01:19:40,214 --> 01:19:42,049

I don't exist.

1841
01:19:51,158 --> 01:19:53,961
- Exactly.
- Are you Bob Ross?

1842
01:19:53,994 --> 01:19:56,430
We are all Bob Ross.

1843
01:19:56,463 --> 01:19:59,066
He can never drop it,
or else everything will fall.

1844
01:19:59,099 --> 01:20:00,602
What if you let it fall?

1845
01:20:00,635 --> 01:20:01,935
What if you let it fall?

1846
01:20:01,969 --> 01:20:05,939
Soon, you'll begin to fall

1847
01:20:05,973 --> 01:20:07,875
into an endless void.

1848
01:20:09,511 --> 01:20:12,212

- Now emerge from you chrysalis

- Come to me.

1850

- This is why nobody's happy!

1851

Are you in the void?

1852

I've done so many things
that I never would have done

1915
01:24:56,831 --> 01:24:58,900
if there wasn't a camera here.

1916
01:24:58,933 --> 01:25:00,902
Like, I wouldn't have done
any of that stuff.

1917
01:25:00,935 --> 01:25:04,237
So, I've learned
a lot about myself

1918
01:25:04,271 --> 01:25:05,472
in a ton of different ways.

1919
01:25:05,506 --> 01:25:10,277
I didn't become enlightened,
and I don't have, like,

1920
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:11,746
anything incredible to give you

1921
01:25:11,779 --> 01:25:14,214
other than
what you've already seen,

1922
01:25:14,247 --> 01:25:16,584
and I hope that you can get
something out of that.

1923
01:25:16,618 --> 01:25:18,485
But, man, it's been
a really cool experience,

1924
01:25:18,519 --> 01:25:19,887
and I'm really happy
that I did this.

1925
01:25:19,921 --> 01:25:22,289
And now, I encourage you

1926
01:25:22,322 --> 01:25:24,692
to find your own answers
about life,

1927
01:25:24,726 --> 01:25:26,594
because at the end of the day,

1928
01:25:26,628 --> 01:25:28,529
no matter what
someone has to tell you,

1929
01:25:28,563 --> 01:25:30,163
it's not gonna mean as much...

1930
01:25:30,197 --> 01:25:32,800
as much as it would if it was
just coming from yourself,

1931
01:25:32,834 --> 01:25:34,836
and you got those answers
on your own.

1932
01:25:34,869 --> 01:25:36,037
And everyone can have
different answers,

1933
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:38,940
and that's what I think
the cool thing about life is.

1934
01:25:38,973 --> 01:25:42,409
Your answer might look
completely different than mine,

1935
01:25:42,442 --> 01:25:43,945
but we all have the same goal,

1936
01:25:43,978 --> 01:25:47,247
which is, I don't know,
a beautiful thing, I guess.

1937
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:48,850
Not to be cheesy,
but that's really cool.

1938
01:25:48,883 --> 01:25:51,786
So go out there,
get your answers,

1939
01:25:51,819 --> 01:25:53,353
make a documentary
if you want to.

1940
01:25:53,387 --> 01:25:56,356
If not, you totally don't have
to do that either.

1941
01:25:56,390 --> 01:25:57,692
But thanks
for watching mine,

1942
01:25:57,725 --> 01:26:00,895
'cause if I didn't make this
with the idea

1943
01:26:00,928 --> 01:26:03,230
that people would be watching it
in mind,

1944
01:26:03,263 --> 01:26:04,264
I wouldn't have made it.

1945
01:26:04,297 --> 01:26:06,333
And thank you to Earl

1946
01:26:06,366 --> 01:26:07,702
for being here to film it.

1947
01:26:07,735 --> 01:26:10,571
And thank you to my mom,

1948
01:26:10,605 --> 01:26:13,574
who I realize that I

1949
01:26:13,608 --> 01:26:15,710
could be treating better.

1950
01:26:15,743 --> 01:26:16,744
And just, I mean,

1951
01:26:16,778 --> 01:26:18,680
thank you to all those people
who scammed me,

1952
01:26:18,713 --> 01:26:20,748
because you taught me
a lesson too.

1953
01:26:20,782 --> 01:26:23,417
And thank you, Claire,
for havin' the guts

1954
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:26,754
to go do somethin' that will
make you look really stupid,

1955
01:26:26,788 --> 01:26:27,955
and you did it anyway.

1956
01:26:27,989 --> 01:26:30,591
And, you know, I'm allowed
to be proud of myself too.

1957
01:26:30,625 --> 01:26:32,560
There's nothin'
wrong with that, right?

1958
01:26:32,593 --> 01:26:33,728
Hopefully, okay.

1959
01:26:33,761 --> 01:26:35,997
Well, thanks for watching!
