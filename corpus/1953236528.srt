1
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,745
Oh! Where did the ball go?

2
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,540
Keep your eye on the ball.

3
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,085
Come on, Nik. lt's easy!

4
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,630
You don't know how to play.

5
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,757
- Like you do?
- Look what you did.

6
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,221
So are we going
to the beach this weekend?

7
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,598
?he water's still cold.

8
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,391
l don't care.
Even if it's freezing, l'm going in.

9
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,809
No matter what, huh?

10
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,061
We're going in no matter what.

11
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,354
Oh, you two are tough, huh?

12
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,939
You afraid of the water?

13
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,650
- Yeah, it's happening.
- We're going.

14
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,003
Hey, turn around.

15
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,727
- Nik.
- May l?

16
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,648
- Where have you been?
- With friends.

17
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,441
Have a sip.

18
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,692
l can't drink that.

19
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,486
- Come on.
- l can't.

20
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,113
?he kitten
doesn't drink vinegar, huh?

21
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,120
- Cheers!
- Hello, Shpend!

22
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,997
- Hey there.
- Still celebrating?

23
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:09,998
Help yourself.

24
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:13,001
- How are the bride and groom?
- Young and in love!

25
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,338
Hey, Mark.
Are you collecting cigarettes?

26
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,675
?ake it. ?ake Nik's too.

27
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,011
Wait, l'll give you another.

28
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,931
Very generous of you, Sokol,

29
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:29,559
but l don't want to get in trouble.
?hey might be stolen.

30
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,437
At least we earn ours.

31
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,690
Relax, Mark.

32
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:38,151
You must be tired from moving
the stones on my land.

33
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,529
Maybe they move by themselves.

34
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,322
Better be careful, Nik.

35
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,533
You never know
where those stones might fly.

36
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,329
Sokol, may you never get fat,

37
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,165
or you won't be able
to work our land.

38
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,333
?o your health!

39
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:56,461
Here's to the health
of your horse Klinsmann,

40
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,880
and those shortcuts he takes.

41
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,382
Klinsmann thanks you

42
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,884
and leaves his respects
wherever he goes.

43
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,761
Even without Klinsmann,

44
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,222
we'd pull our cart
across our grandfather's land.

45
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,725
Cheers!

46
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,893
Why don't you go around, Mark?

47
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,895
You never know.

48
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,315
Sometimes
the long way is shorter...

49
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,566
and safer.

50
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,067
Stop it.

51
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,362
Enough.

52
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,405
Cheers!

53
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,324
Cheers, old man!

54
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,451
Who you calling an old man?

55
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,603
Here you go.

56
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,730
Milk.

57
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,235
l'll get that.
Go get ready.

58
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,802
Get the tomatoes from Uncle Zef's
and take them inside.

59
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,685
How'd you sleep?

60
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,021
Good. You? You're all up?

61
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,147
Yeah.

62
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,024
Has Mark left?

63
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,984
He's getting ready.

64
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,592
ln front of the mirror again?

65
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,886
- What's your problem?
- You're like a girl.

66
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,179
Watch it.

67
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,639
Staring at himself...

68
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,015
ls that what you're wearing?

69
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,684
What's wrong with it?

70
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,893
Look.

71
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,311
Roll down your sleeves.

72
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,355
- Leave them alone. ?hey're fine.
- Roll them down.

73
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,481
Just leave them.
?hey're fine.

74
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,816
Unzip it.

75
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,651
Just leave me alone.
l know how to dress. You crazy?

76
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:25,735
Do whatever you want.

77
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:26,695
Leave me alone.

78
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,655
l'm just saying it looks ridiculous.

79
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,699
Breakfast is on the table.

80
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,826
- Roll your sleeves down.
- Go away.

81
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,705
Wake up the little ones.
l need to get ready for work.

82
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,417
Dren, wake up.

83
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,378
Bora, time for school.

84
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,379
Come on, get up.

85
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,883
Dad, can l have 200 lek?
l need a new notebook.

86
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,968
You go right through them.

87
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,887
But it's for school.

88
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,055
Rudina, here you go.

89
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,141
?hank you.

90
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,352
Dren, finish your milk.

91
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,355
- l don't want any more.
- Finish it.

92
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,815
We need to move
the cement up to the roof.

93
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,233
For the back wall?

94
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,276
We'll do it tomorrow.

95
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,861
l'm off to work.

96
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,196
Bye.

97
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,574
- Bora, where's your backpack?
- By the TV.

98
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,743
Go get it.
And get Dren's too.

99
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,329
Hurry up, Dren.

100
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,177
What are you doing?

101
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,723
No electricity?

102
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,974
Nope.

103
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,870
Director!

104
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,456
- ?he keys.
- ?hanks.

105
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,309
Did you see her smiling?

106
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,813
Yeah, she was smiling.

107
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,982
She was, right?

108
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:28,900
Hang on.

109
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,569
Again?

110
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,964
Let's go.

111
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,841
You're crazy.

112
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,135
Four or five computers
and l'm set.

113
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,013
lt'll be awesome.

114
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,265
Yeah, right.
Where you gonna get the money?

115
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,518
Clear out, guys.

116
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,186
We've got work to do.

117
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,771
Move it.

118
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,690
But we were here first.

119
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,152
Come on. Let's go.

120
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,404
Clear out.

121
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,405
Move.

122
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,407
l swear,
it happened so many times.

123
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,701
He came and grabbed
my paper from behind.

124
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,703
He wouldn't let go.

125
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,247
Rudina, come on.
l'll give you a ride.

126
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,874
l'm going.

127
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,963
How was school?

128
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,214
Giddyap!

129
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,383
Good.

130
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,510
?he teacher gave us a quiz.

131
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,055
l had to talk about sponges.

132
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,766
?he thing is,
people thought they were plants.

133
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,726
But they have, like, fins --

134
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:45,727
Fins?

135
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,063
Yeah, like, fins
they use to beat the water,

136
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,148
and they take all the water
and all the bacteria,

137
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,400
and it goes in this, like, cavity,

138
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:53,902
and they feed off it,

139
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,573
but sometimes stuff gets stuck
inside and can't get out.

140
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,451
l mean, it gets out eventually.

141
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:04,245
l'm not sure how,
but it's really neat.

142
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,581
- What did your teacher give you?
- A ten.

143
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:08,708
Dad...

144
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:12,879
Mira and lrena are going to Shkodra
Saturday to buy shoes.

145
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,214
And?

146
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:17,133
Please, l need new shoes.

147
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,885
l'll go with you.

148
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,846
What do you know
about girls' shoes?

149
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,598
l know plenty.

150
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,614
Pass me two corn breads.

151
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,254
- How are you, Mark?
- l'm fine.

152
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,463
?hank you.

153
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,298
Hi, Rudina. How are you?

154
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,926
- Your new passport?
- Yes, l got it.

155
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,094
But the photo is terrible.

156
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:01,970
Let me see.

157
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,012
No, Mark.

158
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:03,972
Let me see.

159
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,308
l was afraid l'd close my eyes.

160
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,894
Just like in our class photo.

161
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,189
Did you and Sokol
get into it again?

162
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,316
With all due respect,

163
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,111
your cousin is an idiot.

164
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,988
?he two of you are ridiculous.

165
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,239
He's ridiculous.

166
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,491
Of course, you're the sane one.

167
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,827
Forget about it.
lt's not worth it.

168
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,662
See you. Bye, Rudina.

169
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:28,997
Bye.

170
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,667
- What's this?
- lt's good, right?

171
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:33,877
For Facebook?

172
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,672
l gotta upload it.
Let me sign in.

173
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,632
Come on, even this one?

174
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,843
- Why not?
- You're crazy.

175
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,345
You can't post that.

176
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,184
lt wasn't easy, believe me.

177
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:50,643
?he girls will go nuts.

178
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,061
Here you go.

179
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:53,855
?ake my bag for me.

180
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,690
- Where are you going?
- l'll see you later.

181
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,633
Tying your shoes here again?

182
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,760
Can l help it
if they come untied here?

183
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,553
Sure, of course not.

184
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,889
Where are you going?

185
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,060
You going to Suadi's party?

186
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,729
lt's his last.
He's off to London.

187
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,273
What's up with Suadi
going to London?

188
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,275
Like you wouldn't
want to go to London?

189
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,319
What for?
?o lug bricks around?

190
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,154
Maybe you'd get some muscles.

191
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,156
So you wanna go to
London too now?

192
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,075
No, l'm going to university.

193
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,744
Your parents won't even
let you go to a party,

194
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,079
never mind university.

195
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,414
What's a party
got to do with university?

196
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,918
Anyway, they know what l'm like.

197
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,169
And what are you like?

198
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,421
What does that mean?

199
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,714
Nothing. l'm kidding.

200
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,258
You're always kidding.

201
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:11,891
Who was that?

202
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:12,934
None of your business.

203
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,269
Who was it?

204
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,937
- My sister.
- Let me see your phone.

205
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,438
You don't believe me?

206
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,942
- Can l have your number?
- What do you need it for?

207
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,736
- You know my number?
- l don't want it.

208
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,905
Come on.
Give me your phone a sec.

209
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,116
Why should l give you my phone?

210
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,159
Just let me see it a second.

211
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,295
- ?hat your number?
- Yeah.

212
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,797
You have money on your phone?
- Why?

213
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,134
What are you doing?

214
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,220
- Come on, relax.
- You're terrible.

215
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,222
You suck.

216
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,473
Bardha...

217
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,530
Son of a...

218
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,412
What the hell?

219
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,915
What the hell, what?

220
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,626
What are you doing?

221
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,336
l had to close the road.

222
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,837
What for?

223
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,631
l have to keep my chickens in.

224
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,508
You expect me to go
all the way around?

225
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,968
?he other way?

226
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,845
Do whatever you want.

227
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,639
lt's not my problem.

228
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,849
l have to get through this road.

229
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,811
Enough is enough.

230
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,189
?he state gave us this land
because we worked it.

231
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,524
When my grandfather
had this land,

232
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,235
our family always let
the town use this road.

233
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:49,197
Your family had
a tradition of bending over.

234
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,201
Don't talk about my family
with your dirty mouth.

235
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:57,205
?hen don't go around
calling us thieves.

236
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,500
You can't close this road.

237
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,085
Who's gonna stop me?

238
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,378
You?

239
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,380
Go ahead and try.

240
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,299
Let's see what you can do.

241
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,552
You don't have the balls.

242
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,224
Get back in the cart.

243
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:17,892
Now!

244
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,068
?his is the last time
you speak like that

245
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,362
in front of my daughter,
understand?

246
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,448
?ake that ugly cart
and get out of here.

247
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,701
You feel tough holding that thing?

248
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,370
lf it wasn't for my daughter,
l'd put you in your place.

249
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,622
So come back without her.

250
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,650
Feed Klinsmann.

251
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,111
l have to talk to your uncle.

252
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,364
Zef!

253
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,119
Stay.

254
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,788
- What did she say?
- lt's not what she said.

255
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,707
Just tell me what she said.

256
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,836
She didn't have to say anything.
lt was what she was thinking.

257
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,130
So what was she thinking?

258
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,675
Well, she didn't reject me, so --

259
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,677
She didn't reject you.
Not bad.

260
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,514
Pass me that wrench.

261
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,974
?his one?

262
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,350
?he other one.

263
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,522
Pass me the shock.

264
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,569
?hese things are completely shot.

265
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:52,862
l already talked to Fredi.

266
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,822
l'm getting the Kawasaki ones.

267
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,491
For this thing?

268
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,284
You should just buy a new bike.

269
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,702
Lift it up.

270
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,996
Lift it.

271
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,624
A little more.

272
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,963
- Nik, where have you been?
- What's up?

273
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,840
We've been looking for you.

274
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,801
- What's going on?
- Come with us.

275
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,886
- Wait, l'm just --
- Come on. ?his can't wait.

276
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,054
Where are you going?

277
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,514
Quick. Move.

278
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,350
- What's going on?
- Just get in and we'll tell you.

279
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,353
Get your head down.

280
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,398
What's going on?

281
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,577
Get inside, quick.

282
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,579
?hank you.

283
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,543
- Did they tell you?
- Yeah. How did it happen?

284
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,504
Sokol blocked the road
and got into a fight with Dad.

285
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,007
Dad told Uncle Zef,
and they went back.

286
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,425
And stabbed him?

287
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,095
?hey arrested Uncle Zef.

288
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,263
Hey, boy!

289
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,890
Come here.

290
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,104
Do you know
where your father is?

291
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,482
No.

292
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,484
When was the last time
you saw him?

293
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,780
?his morning.

294
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,618
?ell me about the fight
he got into with Sokol at the pub.

295
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,786
He doesn't know anything.

296
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,455
Who started the fight?

297
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,044
Listen...

298
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,004
he'd be safer in custody

299
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,672
than he is in hiding.

300
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,716
We don't know where he is.

301
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:24,764
Let's go.

302
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,314
As if we didn't know

303
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,524
Sokol's cousin is a police officer.

304
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,151
Have you heard from Dad?

305
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:40,696
Adrian Pragami saw him running
across his field afterwards.

306
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,657
He's probably headed for Rragam.

307
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,159
We've tried calling.

308
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,495
His phone is off.

309
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,843
For the moment,

310
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,806
you might not owe
his family any blood at all.

311
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,475
But you know
that's not the way they see it.

312
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:13,020
By the Kanun, your family
must stay in isolation.

313
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,106
But Sokol did you wrong

314
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,983
with your road and your land.

315
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,360
So we have to know
what happened:

316
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,779
who attacked whom,
what started it.

317
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:24,198
Maybe he stabbed himself

318
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,200
as he tumbled to the ground.

319
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,787
Even if my sons are partly to blame,
Sokol blocked the road.

320
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,540
He cut off my son's livelihood.

321
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,209
So there should be no blood debt.

322
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,752
Ded, the Kanun says
to protect your land.

323
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,505
Remember what happened
to Kujtim Sula?

324
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,923
What happened?

325
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,717
Somebody broke into his house.

326
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,593
He tried to defend it with a gun

327
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,847
and ended up shooting the boy.

328
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,516
Even then, Kujtim spent
five years in isolation

329
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,311
just for trying to protect his home.

330
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,229
But here they don't know
what they're defending.

331
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,899
They believe
it's their land to protect.

332
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,573
l wish Dad would send
a message already.

333
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,491
lt could be dangerous.

334
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,245
So how many people
are we sending?

335
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,247
?hree people to ask for a besa.

336
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,583
We need to send the right people.

337
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,793
lf they grant the besa,
how many go to the funeral?

338
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:18,794
Twenty.

339
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,755
l want to go too
if they give us a besa.

340
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,049
You're too young.

341
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,510
l'm old enough to be targeted.
l should represent my father.

342
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,262
Out of the question.

343
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,489
Get back inside!

344
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,911
What do you think you're doing?

345
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,662
Nothing.
l just wanted to see.

346
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,623
What the hell are you thinking?

347
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,584
You don't set foot outside,
understand?

348
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,337
From now on,
we all stay inside.

349
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,964
Out of respect for their loss.

350
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,258
Dren as well.

351
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:14,011
- Dren's just a child.
- lt doesn't matter!

352
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,679
lt's too risky.

353
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,885
You're gonna use up
all the minutes.

354
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,928
Hello, Shpend. How are you?

355
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:38,929
Everything okay?

356
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,055
Fine.

357
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,936
- What's this?
- My wife prepared these for you.

358
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,105
?hat's very kind of her.
Thank you.

359
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,236
How are you?

360
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,030
Mark sent a text message

361
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,365
to let you know he's safe.

362
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,910
lt was from an anonymous number.

363
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,604
Rudina.

364
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,107
Your grandfather and l
have decided

365
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,735
that starting tomorrow,
you'll do the bread route.

366
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,072
- Me?
- Yes, you.

367
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:39,698
Why?

368
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,742
We need to do something.

369
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,911
We can't survive like this.

370
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:48,916
As it is, my foreman will fire me
if l don't get back.

371
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,460
Just 'cause she's a girl?

372
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:54,004
Nik, you need to help her.

373
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,257
What about school?

374
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,594
And your brothers?
How would they feel

375
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,097
if you went while they couldn't?

376
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,309
For how long?

377
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,687
Until your father comes back.

378
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,314
When is that going to be?

379
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,708
Always put the chain on this side
so you don't hurt him.

380
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:32,918
?ry it.

381
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,381
No, the way l told you.
Like this.

382
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,758
And always on the fourth link.
Understand?

383
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,051
Yes.

384
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,055
You have to tie this here.
Twice.

385
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,278
Tight. Understand?
Show me.

386
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,325
Don't be so nervous.
He's not going to do anything.

387
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,497
Good.

388
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:12,624
Tight.

389
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,334
Again, tight. Good.

390
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,920
Shh! Klinsmann.

391
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,133
Rudina.

392
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,031
Nik.

393
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,659
What?

394
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,746
- l'm hungry.
- Ask Bora.

395
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:36,166
- l don't know what to make.
- Whatever Rudina makes.

396
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,460
- l'm hungry!
- Enough!

397
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:51,723
Rudina...

398
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,433
l already got my bread.

399
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,019
From who?

400
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,438
Kristjan Lukaj.
He's been bringing it from Shkodra.

401
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,941
But you always get it from us.

402
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,777
What can l tell you?

403
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,946
l can't buy bread l don't need.

404
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:11,785
Can't you just buy
your usual order?

405
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,788
What would l do with it?

406
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,209
What about tomorrow?

407
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:22,170
Tomorrow...

408
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,423
get here before Kristjan
and l'll take your bread.

409
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,757
Okay?

410
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,473
Rudina.

411
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:35,976
Wait a moment.

412
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,482
l have to get going.

413
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:00,834
Take this.

414
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,002
Thank you.

415
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,071
No, Klinsmann. Not here.

416
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,864
Let's go.

417
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,214
How am l supposed to kill him?

418
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:49,716
You have to be faster.

419
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,593
l'm trying, but he's too fast.

420
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,470
You shouldn't play
if you don't know how.

421
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,973
You think you're
the only one who can play?

422
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,976
l know how to play.

423
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,065
Go, Bora.

424
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:22,916
Hey.

425
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,836
What's up?

426
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,129
What's this?

427
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,714
What have you done here?

428
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,508
Some modifications.
Check it out.

429
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:32,968
This is new?

430
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,053
What did you do?
lt's crooked!

431
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,097
You got the shocks.

432
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,223
What do you think?

433
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,474
Where'd you get the money?

434
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,201
Enough, enough.

435
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,044
Over here.
l can't go out there.

436
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,549
What's happening?

437
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:15,010
There was a party at Klodi's.

438
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,513
- How was it?
- Good. We had fun.

439
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,349
- What was it for?
- His 1 8th birthday.

440
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:24,144
The whole class went.
- Everyone?

441
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,353
The whole senior class.

442
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,438
Everyone?

443
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,023
Yeah.

444
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,566
Did you get drunk?

445
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,318
Yeah, what do you think?

446
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,945
- Was Bardha there?
- She was there.

447
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,989
But Klodi, l don't know --

448
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,407
Why? What happened?

449
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:40,160
We were all dancing,
and he kept making her laugh.

450
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,704
Klodi? Are you kidding?

451
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,915
l'm just saying.
You better do something.

452
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:48,418
Write some love poems
or something.

453
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,587
What do you do all day?

454
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:51,755
Think.

455
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,298
lf you keep sitting on your ass,

456
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,509
you'll end up
looking like my uncle.

457
00:34:58,471 --> 00:34:59,554
You all right?

458
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,099
l'm fine.

459
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,810
At first l couldn't believe
it was true, but now --

460
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,437
They'll figure
something out eventually.

461
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,482
Yeah,
but how long is eventually?

462
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,235
You remember that kid
in fourth grade

463
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,654
who had to stay in isolation?

464
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,532
Jetmir Malaj.

465
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,534
He was stuck in his house
for, like, six years.

466
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,036
Yeah, but they got some mediator,
and they settled it.

467
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,538
Eventually they always mediate.

468
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:29,709
All they do is sit
and talk about the Kanun.

469
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,888
Ndue Binaku's cousin asked me

470
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,266
to deliver lime to his new house.

471
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,101
- And you did it?
- Yeah.

472
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,727
- How much did he pay you?
- Three thousand.

473
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,647
You shouldn't do something
like that for less than 5,000.

474
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,858
l was already going
in that direction.

475
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,401
lt doesn't matter.

476
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:55,652
What was l supposed to do?

477
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,821
Rudina, where's the cell phone?
l bought more minutes.

478
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,703
l'll do it.

479
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,997
Where'd you put the phone?
- Over there.

480
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:57,505
Did you find someplace safe?

481
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:00,175
lt's best you don't know
where l am.

482
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,677
What about the police?

483
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,138
They've been by twice.

484
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:07,849
Are you okay?

485
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,476
Well enough.

486
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,144
My eyes are acting up.

487
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,188
l need my drops.

488
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,733
Has Sokol's family tried anything?

489
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,152
They refuse to listen to us.

490
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,321
They didn't give us
a besa for the funeral.

491
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,323
They say
they were doubly insulted

492
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,533
because you and Uncle Zef
came onto their land.

493
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,410
We went to talk to him.

494
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,664
We didn't do anything.
We were unarmed.

495
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,624
He welcomed us with his knife.

496
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,626
He attacked you?

497
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,544
He jumped on us like a crazy dog.

498
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,088
Mark...

499
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,257
your soup is getting cold.

500
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,385
Do we have any cigarettes?

501
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,847
Did Dritan bring the gun?

502
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,433
l sent word for him to bring it.

503
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,856
You need to keep it loaded...

504
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,526
or there's no point having it.

505
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,547
Did Sokol do that to you?

506
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,512
Now load it.

507
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,420
Have you come across any of them?

508
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:02,047
No.

509
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,507
Make sure
you don't provoke them.

510
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,719
lf you see them on the street,
avoid them.

511
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,768
Kristjan Lukaj has been
bringing in bread from Shkodra.

512
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,270
But...

513
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,272
l start earlier now.

514
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:35,955
The time.

515
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:46,966
The light.

516
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:50,845
Good-bye.

517
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,316
Bread.

518
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,734
Thanks.

519
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:06,861
How are you?

520
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,363
Fine. And you?

521
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,531
Good.

522
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:11,825
Here's your money.

523
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,285
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

524
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,495
Good morning.

525
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,998
Four packs of cigarettes.
The same kind as always.

526
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,298
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

527
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,306
You sell a lot of cigarettes?

528
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,933
Depends on the people.

529
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,560
But...

530
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,270
how much does a carton cost?

531
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:43,022
Fifteen thousand, twenty thousand,

532
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:44,941
depending on the brand.

533
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,861
And how much do you make?

534
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,155
Why do you want to know?

535
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,701
lf l buy three cartons,
can l pay you at the end of the week?

536
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:58,204
l work with money, Rudina.

537
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,707
l give credit all the time.

538
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:04,043
You're going to sell cigarettes?

539
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,881
A girl like you shouldn't even
be selling bread.

540
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,886
l'll give you the money
in a few days.

541
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,597
Thursday you'll pay me.

542
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:18,808
But...

543
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,602
since l'm getting three cartons,

544
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,229
l need a discount.

545
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,815
That's how it works.

546
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,894
- Hey.
- You're here?

547
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,856
Of course l'm here.
You thought l'd chicken out?

548
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:32,191
You're crazy.
What are you doing here?

549
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,693
What are you doing here?

550
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,528
l can't believe l made it.

551
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,865
Did you have trouble
getting out?

552
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:41,868
No, it was easy.
lt was weird how easy it was.

553
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,580
What do you do all day?

554
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:46,914
l don't know.

555
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,500
Watch TV... think of you.

556
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:50,877
Shut up.

557
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,590
l heard there was a party
for Klodi's birthday.

558
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:56,924
Yeah. lt was boring.

559
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,635
l heard you were laughing
at his jokes.

560
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,887
- l was not.
- That's not what l heard.

561
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:02,388
You heard wrong.

562
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:04,307
- Really?
- Yes.

563
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,229
Did you miss me?

564
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,549
Do you really think
they would try something?

565
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:41,135
My grandfather says
they'd be happy

566
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,429
if they shot me or Dren.

567
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,139
He's just a little boy.

568
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:46,474
They know

569
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,851
it would hurt my family
more than anything.

570
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,145
My uncle has only daughters.

571
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,774
Anyway, they're happy
to see us suffer.

572
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,859
They won't let it end.

573
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:58,778
lt's so stupid.

574
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:00,822
l hate Sokol Bala.

575
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,490
l shouldn't talk badly
about the dead,

576
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,033
but if it wasn't for him --

577
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:06,744
Sokol Bala, your father...

578
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,454
your uncle --

579
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,873
My father was just defending himself.
Sokol insulted him.

580
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:14,377
The slightest insult
and they go crazy.

581
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,963
They all act like children.

582
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,639
l told Fatjana
l was going to meet you.

583
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,266
What? Why?

584
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:30,268
Don't worry.

585
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:32,812
- What if she tells someone?
- She won't tell anyone.

586
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:34,397
Why did you tell her?

587
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:35,648
l don't know.

588
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:37,608
l just had to tell someone.

589
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:42,029
She said l was stupid
for seeing you.

590
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:45,283
Who knows how long
you'll be in the feud.

591
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,332
You agree with her?

592
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:31,782
Wash your hands.

593
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,166
Put it in and pack it down.

594
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:52,637
Hold it.

595
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,684
Hold it straight.

596
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:13,676
What's this?

597
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,594
We made weights!

598
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:18,931
Nik.

599
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:24,562
- Why did you do this here?
- What?

600
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,105
Why did you do this here?

601
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,607
What's the big deal?

602
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:30,526
You expect me
to clean up after you?

603
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:31,777
l'm not cleaning it up.

604
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,070
Who asked you to?

605
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,613
What do you do all day?

606
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:36,991
Stop yelling.

607
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,659
lt's not a big deal.

608
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,541
Nik!

609
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:47,626
Get down!

610
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,086
Dren!

611
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:05,311
Why should they shoot at you?

612
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:07,938
You've stayed inside.
You've been respectful.

613
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,983
Zef got 1 8 years.
They should be satisfied.

614
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,986
Now's the time to send
someone to talk to them.

615
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,989
What about Samet Leka?

616
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,283
Why should they listen to Samet?

617
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:21,827
He does business
with their family.

618
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:25,039
That was years ago.

619
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,041
lt's not the right time
to send someone.

620
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,168
Clearly their blood is still hot.

621
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,671
What about the person who mediated
for Enver Malaj's family?

622
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:35,925
l used to go to school
with his son, Jetmir.

623
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,762
Who mediated for Enver Malaj?

624
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:42,181
lt was their flagsman.

625
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:45,351
No, they used Hasan Pema.

626
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,519
Who is Hasan Pema?

627
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,521
He's from Shkodra.

628
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,314
He's done a lot of mediations.

629
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,359
We'll deal with it ourselves.

630
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,694
But we need
someone with experience.

631
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:58,656
We have plenty of experience.

632
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,574
But we've never done this before.

633
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,660
You can't just send
some stranger to their door.

634
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,120
You have to send
the right person

635
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:06,205
with a group of elders

636
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:09,375
whom they know and respect.

637
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:12,128
You wait
for the right moment to go.

638
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:14,547
They say no.

639
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:18,134
Then you wait and go again.

640
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,678
That's just how it works.

641
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,429
An outsider would be neutral.

642
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:25,057
They might respect
someone who's mediated before.

643
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:35,401
No.

644
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,070
We'll solve our own problems.

645
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:30,349
How many still owe on credit?

646
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,020
Only six.

647
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,441
Good.

648
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,027
That's good.

649
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:20,774
Thank you.

650
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,402
Here you go.

651
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:27,489
Thank you.

652
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:29,908
You always give me
ones that are still warm.

653
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,661
l pull them
from the bottom of the pile.

654
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:34,246
Just like your father.

655
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:37,082
How is he?

656
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,377
l haven't seen him.

657
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:43,922
On top of everything else,
you're without your father.

658
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,759
You should know

659
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,304
not all my family
is of the same mind.

660
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,265
My uncle understands

661
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:55,601
there's enough blame
to go around.

662
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:58,520
lt's my cousins
who keep on about your father.

663
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:01,190
They insist he should be in jail

664
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:02,441
before they'll consider mediation.

665
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:03,776
But --

666
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:06,111
l know, l know.
lt's so stupid.

667
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:34,241
Come on.
We did this last week.

668
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:37,035
Dren...

669
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:40,539
start working and show me
what we learned last week.

670
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:44,877
Come on.

671
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,463
Dren, answer me.

672
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:48,714
What are you doing?

673
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,009
Sit up properly.

674
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,802
Pick up the pencil.

675
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:57,389
Are you listening? Start.
- l don't want to.

676
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,391
Listen to your teacher.

677
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:01,977
Where are you going?
Come back here!

678
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:03,937
What are you doing?

679
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:05,355
Get back over there.

680
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:07,149
Give me that.

681
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:09,568
Give me the controller.

682
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:12,154
- lt's mine. lt's my game.
- Give it to me.

683
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:15,657
Dren!

684
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,244
Come here!

685
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:21,079
Dren, come out!

686
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:26,752
Dren.

687
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,421
You hear me?

688
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:32,424
Don't be a baby.
Mr. Skendaj's waiting.

689
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:34,760
Dren!

690
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:36,762
Fine. Don't come out.

691
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:38,096
See if l care.

692
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,172
Dren...

693
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:15,509
you remember the story
Dad used to tell us

694
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:17,886
about the little boy
and the giant?

695
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,181
Remember
what the little boy did?

696
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:23,976
Remember how he was?

697
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,647
That's how you have to be.

698
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:33,569
Understand?

699
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,035
You have to be strong.

700
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:31,710
Turn back.

701
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:36,214
Don't cross my path
with that cart.

702
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:39,551
Turn back!

703
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:41,595
Stay in your village
with that thing.

704
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:42,721
Got it?

705
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:43,972
Go!

706
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:48,977
Go, Klinsmann.

707
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,166
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome.

708
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:13,710
- Hasan Pema.
- Thank you for coming.

709
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:17,839
- Hello.
- How are you? Nik Lindani.

710
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:19,341
- Hasan Pema.
- Thank you for coming.

711
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:20,884
Good to be here.

712
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,761
You're Nik?
- Yes.

713
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:24,513
How are you?

714
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:25,764
Ded Lindani.

715
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:27,766
Nice to meet you.

716
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,309
Nice to meet you too.

717
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,356
By the Kanun, they should not

718
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,942
threaten a girl
or kill her for revenge.

719
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:40,654
Either they don't know the Kanun
or they're twisting it.

720
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:44,950
The Kanun respects him who forgives
more than him who kills.

721
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:47,452
When Nik's friend told me

722
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:51,039
about the situation you're in
and his sister being threatened,

723
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:53,959
my organization felt obliged
to do something.

724
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:58,630
My heart hurts
to hear of your troubles.

725
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:02,134
You need someone
with experience.

726
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:04,678
Over the past 1 5 years

727
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:07,013
l've mediated 47 feuds.

728
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,599
lf you entrust this case to me,

729
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,143
l promise to work hard

730
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:13,812
until blood is forgiven.

731
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:16,982
How long will it take?

732
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,860
Peace must have strong roots

733
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:21,987
so that it cannot be
easily destroyed.

734
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:23,822
Of course...

735
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:25,073
all of this work

736
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:28,160
comes with certain expenses.

737
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:30,912
The telephone...

738
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:33,415
gas...

739
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:34,916
certain gifts.

740
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:38,587
Their wound is still bleeding.

741
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:41,757
The Kanun calls for the payment

742
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:44,634
of six sacks of gold
at the closure of a feud.

743
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:45,761
We already know

744
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:47,512
what the Kanun says.

745
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:48,722
Reading the Kanun

746
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:51,683
and applying it
are two different things.

747
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:53,643
But my uncle's in jail.

748
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,312
He's already paying
for the crime.

749
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,105
But your father is still free.

750
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:58,648
He didn't do anything.

751
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,358
Didn't do anything?

752
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:02,402
Holding Sokol
while Zef stabbed him?

753
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,404
You saw what happened?

754
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,281
l've done my homework.

755
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:09,075
You mean you've been gossiping.

756
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,369
They don't care what's right.

757
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:12,996
All they want is blood.

758
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:14,080
That's why l'm here.

759
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:16,666
You need someone with experience

760
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,418
to represent you.

761
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:22,214
We know what happened,
and we're very sorry.

762
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:24,674
lt's Sokol's actions
that bring us here.

763
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,677
He came out with a knife
to stab them in their backs.

764
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,346
They did nothing
but defend themselves.

765
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:33,350
You can't condemn a murder
and defend it at the same time.

766
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:37,771
You're calling us
murderers and hypocrites?

767
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:40,065
As l said,

768
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:42,734
we appreciate
your coming to visit.

769
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:45,445
Of course, our door
is always open to you.

770
01:03:57,416 --> 01:03:58,750
Give me some of the white ones.

771
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:03,463
Hurry up.

772
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:10,846
Use the blue ones.

773
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:25,026
Who is it?

774
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:30,782
NO MEDlATOR CAN SAVE YOU.

775
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:05,483
You made it.

776
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,040
What's this?

777
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:24,920
Barbie!

778
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:32,260
Dren, what's wrong?

779
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:35,639
Dren.

780
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:37,807
Come here.

781
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:47,025
He's tired.

782
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,027
Are you tired?

783
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:52,656
You forget how to talk?

784
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:54,950
He hasn't been feeling well.

785
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:56,868
What happened?

786
01:05:57,495 --> 01:05:59,371
He wants to go to school.

787
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:01,915
ls the school still
sending his teacher?

788
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:06,169
ls Mr. Skendaj coming
to give you lessons?

789
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:12,050
Dren and Bora
should be in school.

790
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:13,927
You think l don't know that?

791
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:17,305
l thought we could get a besa

792
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:19,891
for them to go back to school.

793
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:21,184
A besa?

794
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:24,479
They don't need a besa.
They're children.

795
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:28,400
By the Kanun
they shouldn't even be targeted.

796
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,819
Then why are they staying home?

797
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:35,031
lf we accept a besa,

798
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:38,576
they can take it away
whenever they want.

799
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:41,746
We'd be at their mercy.
Have you thought about that?

800
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:45,375
What makes you even think
they'd give us a besa?

801
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:48,920
We don't know if we don't try.

802
01:06:49,046 --> 01:06:52,382
So you bring in someone
from outside?

803
01:06:52,883 --> 01:06:55,343
Do you know what
he's telling their family?

804
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:57,637
How do you know
he's not making things worse?

805
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:06,980
You think his kind
cares about resolving this?

806
01:07:07,606 --> 01:07:09,941
What's he going to live on
if feuds are resolved?

807
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:11,526
Use your head.

808
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:17,699
Then let's ask Mr. Skendaj.

809
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:19,534
To do what?

810
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:22,120
- To ask for a besa.
- He's right.

811
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:23,913
He teaches Sokol's children too.

812
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,874
They might listen to him.

813
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:47,562
She should have had
a proper birthday.

814
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:50,398
Then you shouldn't have
picked a fight with Dad.

815
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:52,817
He shouldn't have
picked a fight with me.

816
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:55,153
Why does he even bother
to come visit?

817
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:57,530
How can you say that?

818
01:07:57,656 --> 01:07:59,449
lt just makes everything worse.

819
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:01,910
- lt's not his fault!
- Whose fault is it, then?

820
01:08:17,843 --> 01:08:19,636
Not here. Over there.

821
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:33,233
More on this side.

822
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:43,868
Wait.

823
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:53,294
Bora!

824
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,797
Let Tom in.

825
01:08:58,217 --> 01:08:59,384
Hey, Nik.

826
01:09:00,052 --> 01:09:01,553
What's with all the bricks?

827
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:04,264
l got something.

828
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:05,682
What?

829
01:09:07,726 --> 01:09:08,685
What's that?

830
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:10,770
- Check it out.
- What's this?

831
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:13,189
My uncle in Toronto
sent me money for it.

832
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:15,108
Look at the video.

833
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:18,027
The class.

834
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:19,362
Hey, Nik! lt's me.

835
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:20,446
How are you?

836
01:09:20,781 --> 01:09:22,532
ls this recording?

837
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,659
Tom got a new phone.

838
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:31,958
Come back. We miss you.

839
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:34,169
Go to the next clip. Ready?

840
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:36,045
- For what?
- Look.

841
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:38,131
Hey, Nik. How are you?

842
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:40,842
Everything's still the same.
Nothing new.

843
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:42,969
We had literature class.

844
01:09:43,095 --> 01:09:45,013
l have to do the homework.

845
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:46,848
lt's easy.

846
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:51,603
Did Tom tell you
Arben and Lindita broke up?

847
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:54,397
You know what Arben's like.

848
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:56,649
What else?

849
01:09:57,234 --> 01:09:59,152
l'm sorry l haven't written,

850
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:01,112
but you know how it is.

851
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,699
We miss you.

852
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:06,993
Everybody asks about you.

853
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:09,829
Even teachers ask about you.

854
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:13,458
I'm sorry
you have to stay home.

855
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:15,877
l hope things get better.

856
01:10:17,838 --> 01:10:19,714
That's all for now.

857
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:21,424
Bye.

858
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:30,350
How do l play it again?

859
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,310
- Oh, God --
- Once more!

860
01:10:34,271 --> 01:10:36,814
- How do l look?
- Fine. Just start.

861
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,150
Hi, Bardha.
How are you?

862
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:40,693
ls everything okay?

863
01:10:40,819 --> 01:10:42,570
Where are you now,
in school or --

864
01:10:42,696 --> 01:10:44,739
Why are you asking questions?

865
01:10:47,701 --> 01:10:50,536
Bardha, this is my gym.

866
01:10:51,121 --> 01:10:52,664
My bars.

867
01:11:01,048 --> 01:11:02,590
l put boards up.

868
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:04,133
Here too.

869
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,261
l'm going to close this up.

870
01:11:09,181 --> 01:11:11,808
Thanks for sending the video.

871
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:14,852
l was happy to see you.

872
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:17,939
l miss all of you too.

873
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:24,362
Seems like you're having
a good time.

874
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,918
l can't wait to see you again.

875
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:41,546
Bye.

876
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:46,509
Enough.

877
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:51,532
Walk straight to school.

878
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:54,535
Keep a close eye on Dren.
Don't let him out of your sight.

879
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:56,954
When you're done,
come straight home.

880
01:12:57,539 --> 01:12:59,582
Don't forget
to thank Mr. Skendaj.

881
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:05,338
Bye.

882
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:05,059
And then my machine jammed,

883
01:16:05,185 --> 01:16:07,228
and the foreman
took it out on me.

884
01:16:08,146 --> 01:16:09,814
He was yelling at you in ltalian?

885
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:11,482
No, that's the owner.

886
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:13,526
The foreman is from Postribe.

887
01:16:14,444 --> 01:16:15,861
- How are you?
- Hi.

888
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:17,405
How's it going?

889
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:19,865
Can l have a pack of Marlboros?

890
01:16:23,996 --> 01:16:26,664
You have any without the tax stamp?
- The tax stamp?

891
01:16:27,207 --> 01:16:28,833
How are you? Good?

892
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:29,834
Fine.

893
01:16:30,502 --> 01:16:35,214
l heard the police were
questioning Shpend about Mark.

894
01:16:35,507 --> 01:16:36,674
Shpend?

895
01:16:37,092 --> 01:16:38,551
Why were they questioning
Shpend?

896
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:42,179
Don't worry.
l'm sure it's nothing.

897
01:16:42,889 --> 01:16:44,432
Don't worry about it.

898
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:45,641
Have a good day.

899
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:47,018
Bye.

900
01:16:57,195 --> 01:16:58,195
Nik!

901
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:12,543
Put your head down.

902
01:17:33,357 --> 01:17:34,982
What did you do to the wall?
Are you crazy?

903
01:17:35,108 --> 01:17:37,026
- lt's a wall. What's your problem?
- What are you talking about?

904
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:38,569
Go complain to Dad!

905
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:39,904
What did you do to the wall?

906
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:40,946
Leave me alone.

907
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:42,907
l can do what l want.
- Get down!

908
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:43,908
l don't want to!

909
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:45,618
Come down!

910
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:46,786
l don't want to!

911
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:48,204
- l told you to get down!
- What's your problem?

912
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:49,538
What are you doing?
Put down that knife!

913
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,082
Get out of here!

914
01:17:51,249 --> 01:17:52,750
Stop it!

915
01:17:52,959 --> 01:17:55,878
What's going on here?
Give me the knife.

916
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:57,004
Give me the knife, Nik!

917
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:58,047
He's messed up everything!

918
01:17:58,173 --> 01:17:59,548
Out! Out!

919
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:00,591
Clean up.

920
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:01,926
Go!

921
01:18:02,052 --> 01:18:03,636
Take the kids and get out.

922
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:05,221
Out! Out!

923
01:19:39,191 --> 01:19:40,441
Go, Klinsmann.

924
01:19:40,567 --> 01:19:41,859
Move.

925
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:12,890
Do you have Marlboros
without the tax stamp?

926
01:20:13,016 --> 01:20:14,725
The ones from Montenegro?

927
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:16,185
No, l don't.

928
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:20,731
You know where l can find them?

929
01:20:23,735 --> 01:20:25,402
Try over there.

930
01:20:36,748 --> 01:20:37,706
Excuse me.

931
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:39,959
Do you have Marlboros
without the tax stamp?

932
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:43,587
No, l don't have any.

933
01:20:55,183 --> 01:20:56,517
l need five cartons.

934
01:20:58,895 --> 01:21:00,354
l don't have that many.

935
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:03,774
You know where l can get them?

936
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:06,610
Try the man over there.

937
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:08,737
He doesn't have them.

938
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,115
Leave me alone.
l've got things to do.

939
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:12,950
Can l buy the ones you have?

940
01:21:13,076 --> 01:21:14,326
No. Now go on.

941
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:26,964
ls Dren asleep?

942
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:28,173
Yeah.

943
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:35,890
Did you hear that?

944
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:55,910
Get water! Rudina, quick!

945
01:21:56,536 --> 01:21:58,871
Rudina, quick! Water!

946
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:01,832
Quick!

947
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:03,834
Nik, don't get close!

948
01:22:04,002 --> 01:22:05,210
Don't get so close!

949
01:22:06,338 --> 01:22:07,338
Water! Quickly!

950
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:47,211
Go inside, go inside.

951
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:14,405
You shouldn't have come.

952
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:17,032
Someone could be watching...

953
01:23:18,201 --> 01:23:20,577
just waiting for you to show up.

954
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:25,416
We have to think
about how to respond.

955
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:29,253
We can't even begin to negotiate
as long as you're still free.

956
01:23:29,462 --> 01:23:31,380
Mara said as much to Rudina.

957
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:34,591
You're talking to Mara about me?

958
01:23:34,759 --> 01:23:36,552
She brought it up.

959
01:23:37,595 --> 01:23:39,054
Go to the police.

960
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:40,431
lf you're innocent,
they'll set you free,

961
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:42,975
and Sokol's family will see it.

962
01:23:43,309 --> 01:23:45,185
lf l'm innocent?

963
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:50,441
Sokol's cousin is a cop.

964
01:23:50,775 --> 01:23:54,069
You think they'll treat me fairly?

965
01:23:56,322 --> 01:23:57,614
At least in prison

966
01:23:58,116 --> 01:23:59,491
you'd be safe.

967
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:02,286
And we could begin
to talk to them.

968
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:07,458
You want to trade
your father away?

969
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:09,793
ls that what you want?

970
01:24:09,961 --> 01:24:12,129
We can't live like this
just because you and Zef --

971
01:24:12,255 --> 01:24:14,339
You can't live like this?

972
01:24:14,549 --> 01:24:16,425
How do you think it is for me?

973
01:24:16,926 --> 01:24:19,053
You think l like living in hiding?

974
01:24:19,179 --> 01:24:20,679
Away from my family?

975
01:24:20,805 --> 01:24:22,139
So turn yourself in.

976
01:24:22,265 --> 01:24:23,599
For yourself, for us.

977
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:26,268
You want to be free,
whatever the cost.

978
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:29,938
You've forgotten

979
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:33,358
that this whole thing started
because l was defending this family.

980
01:24:33,485 --> 01:24:35,152
By holding Sokol down
while Uncle Zef --

981
01:24:35,278 --> 01:24:38,113
l was trying
to save my brother's life!

982
01:24:41,451 --> 01:24:43,452
You're ready to sell me out...

983
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:45,496
just like that.

984
01:24:46,998 --> 01:24:48,415
ls it that easy?

985
01:25:47,433 --> 01:25:50,227
Don't move! Don't move!
Hands up!

986
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:52,229
Police! Police!

987
01:25:52,939 --> 01:25:54,314
Get down!

988
01:25:57,485 --> 01:26:00,237
On the ground! Get down!

989
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:04,032
Hold him!

990
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:06,034
Hands behind your back!

991
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:07,578
Stay down!

992
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:13,500
Get him up! Up!

993
01:26:14,252 --> 01:26:17,087
Let's go! Move!

994
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:12,184
Nik.

995
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:22,236
l wasn't sure which one.

996
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:23,820
Those will do.

997
01:27:30,161 --> 01:27:32,621
What are you waiting for?
Go get ready.

998
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:36,625
Nik...

999
01:27:36,751 --> 01:27:39,670
you finally get a besa, and now
you want to stay in the house?

1000
01:27:39,837 --> 01:27:41,296
What will l tell your father

1001
01:27:41,422 --> 01:27:43,215
when he asks
why you didn't come visit?

1002
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,425
We have to do
something for him --

1003
01:27:45,551 --> 01:27:46,885
l can't go there.

1004
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:51,682
l expect you to work
on the stable.

1005
01:27:53,351 --> 01:27:55,435
See if Dren and Bora are ready.

1006
01:28:23,881 --> 01:28:25,716
How's your father?
Have you seen him?

1007
01:28:25,842 --> 01:28:27,092
No.

1008
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:29,720
We need money for a lawyer.

1009
01:28:29,887 --> 01:28:32,264
You have to take
advantage of your besa.

1010
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:34,558
That's why l'm here, Mara.

1011
01:28:34,684 --> 01:28:36,601
We can't rely on just a besa.

1012
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:38,812
lf you could go
and talk to them --

1013
01:28:40,106 --> 01:28:42,232
lt's too early.
You just got the besa.

1014
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,318
We need to do something.

1015
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:48,030
lt's not a woman's business.

1016
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:50,324
lt's a man's job.
Women's opinions don't count.

1017
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:52,034
My father's in prison.

1018
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:54,244
What more do they expect --
for me to shoot him?

1019
01:28:54,412 --> 01:28:55,454
lt's not that, but --

1020
01:28:55,663 --> 01:28:57,039
What about Valmir
threatening my sister?

1021
01:28:57,165 --> 01:28:59,916
He's a bad influence in our family.
He's caused a lot of problems.

1022
01:29:02,128 --> 01:29:03,962
That's why l'm saying...

1023
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:07,424
if you could go...

1024
01:29:07,884 --> 01:29:09,718
to talk with your uncle --

1025
01:29:11,429 --> 01:29:13,055
Maybe by Christmas

1026
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:15,432
he might be willing
to receive someone.

1027
01:29:15,558 --> 01:29:17,601
Maybe we can do something then.

1028
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:20,103
- This Christmas?
- Yes.

1029
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:32,616
Stay, Klinsmann.

1030
01:29:38,456 --> 01:29:39,623
Does he kick?

1031
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:41,416
No, he doesn't kick.

1032
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:45,045
He just doesn't know you,
and there are other horses,

1033
01:29:45,171 --> 01:29:47,005
so he's nervous.

1034
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:51,968
His legs are crooked.

1035
01:29:55,473 --> 01:29:57,099
He has two bumps over his eyes.

1036
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:59,643
Means he scares easy.

1037
01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:01,478
But he's a strong horse.

1038
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:04,606
And he's a hard worker.

1039
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:11,154
l'll give you 200,000.

1040
01:30:11,656 --> 01:30:13,323
No, 400.

1041
01:30:13,491 --> 01:30:15,325
Four hundred?
lt's not a female.

1042
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:17,327
Only a female's worth 400,000.

1043
01:30:17,537 --> 01:30:19,329
Two fifty.

1044
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:23,500
Three hundred and -- three fifty.

1045
01:30:25,378 --> 01:30:27,170
We'll leave it at 300,000.

1046
01:30:27,296 --> 01:30:28,797
Three hundred thousand.

1047
01:30:28,923 --> 01:30:30,674
Three twenty.

1048
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:36,346
He's a very good horse.
l'm not lowering my price.

1049
01:31:25,438 --> 01:31:26,897
- Hey, turn left.
- Why?

1050
01:31:27,064 --> 01:31:28,565
Just do it. You'll see.

1051
01:31:37,992 --> 01:31:38,992
What do you think?

1052
01:31:39,535 --> 01:31:40,952
l don't know.

1053
01:31:41,537 --> 01:31:42,746
l'll be right back.

1054
01:31:51,881 --> 01:31:53,256
- Hey.
- Nik.

1055
01:31:54,467 --> 01:31:55,592
Did you hear?

1056
01:31:55,968 --> 01:31:58,595
- Yeah, they gave you a besa.
- Yeah, two weeks.

1057
01:31:59,013 --> 01:32:00,263
That's it?

1058
01:32:00,431 --> 01:32:03,016
We asked for a month,
but that's all they gave us.

1059
01:32:03,142 --> 01:32:05,519
Anyway, l'm happy for you.

1060
01:32:09,607 --> 01:32:12,484
l wanted to see you,

1061
01:32:13,069 --> 01:32:14,903
but l wasn't sure if --

1062
01:32:15,029 --> 01:32:16,821
Nik.

1063
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:26,831
Anyway, l just wanted to say hi.

1064
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:30,502
Well, enjoy your freedom.

1065
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:33,964
- See you.
- Bye.

1066
01:32:46,435 --> 01:32:47,519
What did she say?

1067
01:32:47,645 --> 01:32:49,104
Nothing.

1068
01:32:53,943 --> 01:32:55,819
Let's do something.

1069
01:34:19,570 --> 01:34:20,904
Come inside.

1070
01:34:21,906 --> 01:34:23,907
You're out of jail?

1071
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:29,579
ls this how you welcome me?

1072
01:34:42,927 --> 01:34:44,886
Why didn't you visit me?

1073
01:34:45,971 --> 01:34:47,347
You got a besa.

1074
01:34:48,099 --> 01:34:50,058
How have you used it?

1075
01:34:51,352 --> 01:34:53,103
Do they know you got out?

1076
01:34:54,605 --> 01:34:56,606
Nik, they took away the besa.

1077
01:34:57,817 --> 01:34:58,650
What?

1078
01:34:58,943 --> 01:35:00,318
The besa isn't important.

1079
01:35:00,778 --> 01:35:02,028
What are you saying?

1080
01:35:02,154 --> 01:35:03,988
There will be others.

1081
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:07,117
The only way to mediate
was if you were in jail.

1082
01:35:07,243 --> 01:35:08,576
You want me to stay in jail?

1083
01:35:08,703 --> 01:35:10,161
- What are we gonna --
- Stop!

1084
01:35:11,956 --> 01:35:13,665
We're both inside now?

1085
01:35:14,333 --> 01:35:16,126
When you were in jail,

1086
01:35:16,293 --> 01:35:17,419
we had a chance, but now --

1087
01:37:16,664 --> 01:37:19,290
l've done everything
l can to respect your loss.

1088
01:37:20,042 --> 01:37:21,334
My life is in your hands.

1089
01:37:22,378 --> 01:37:24,754
lf you want to kill me,
l'm right here.

1090
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:29,217
So kill me now,
or let us go free.

1091
01:37:29,343 --> 01:37:31,135
What are you doing here?

1092
01:37:31,929 --> 01:37:35,056
Are you trying to provoke
my grandfather?

1093
01:37:35,182 --> 01:37:37,767
l've come to end this feud.

1094
01:37:37,893 --> 01:37:40,562
You bribed
your father's way out of jail.

1095
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:43,147
How much will you pay
to end this feud?

1096
01:37:44,775 --> 01:37:46,734
Your father's freedom is an insult.

1097
01:37:46,861 --> 01:37:48,778
Being trapped inside isn't freedom.

1098
01:37:48,904 --> 01:37:51,656
Good, because you'll be inside
your entire life.

1099
01:37:51,782 --> 01:37:53,449
Now go home.

1100
01:37:53,617 --> 01:37:55,660
Go home where you belong.

1101
01:37:55,786 --> 01:37:57,078
Hear me?

1102
01:38:10,342 --> 01:38:11,426
Not here!

1103
01:38:11,552 --> 01:38:14,304
Not on our land!
lt would be shameful on our land!

1104
01:38:17,474 --> 01:38:18,725
Get up.

1105
01:38:22,146 --> 01:38:23,396
l've listened to you.

1106
01:38:23,522 --> 01:38:25,231
Now you listen to me.

1107
01:38:27,192 --> 01:38:30,862
l wake up every morning
with tears in my eyes for my son.

1108
01:38:32,489 --> 01:38:36,326
This feud pains us
as much as it does you.

1109
01:38:37,536 --> 01:38:39,829
Your father is out of jail,

1110
01:38:40,748 --> 01:38:44,042
and if he ever steps
out of his house, he's dead.

1111
01:38:45,544 --> 01:38:47,295
You say you respect me,

1112
01:38:47,421 --> 01:38:50,173
but you come here
with ultimatums.

1113
01:38:50,424 --> 01:38:52,216
You come here with great courage,

1114
01:38:52,343 --> 01:38:55,178
but you're still young,
just a kid.

1115
01:38:56,013 --> 01:38:58,014
You want to be free.

1116
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:00,350
Okay.

1117
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:03,353
But you, and only you.

1118
01:39:04,772 --> 01:39:07,899
You have 24 hours
to say good-bye to your family.

1119
01:39:08,025 --> 01:39:10,401
After that,
don't ever come back.

1120
01:39:10,527 --> 01:39:13,529
lf you go,
we won't come after you.

1121
01:39:13,781 --> 01:39:15,365
But if you return,

1122
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:18,451
we'll bury you next to my son.

1123
01:39:25,125 --> 01:39:26,542
Now go.

1124
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:30,213
Take him.

1125
01:40:19,138 --> 01:40:21,931
Where will he go?
Where's he going to stay?

1126
01:40:22,057 --> 01:40:23,599
lf he leaves,
he'll never come back.

1127
01:40:23,726 --> 01:40:26,310
Eventually we'll reconcile,
and then he'll return.

1128
01:40:26,437 --> 01:40:27,395
lf he leaves,

1129
01:40:27,521 --> 01:40:29,731
it's the same
as giving them blood.

1130
01:40:29,857 --> 01:40:31,482
l'm going to lose my son.

1131
01:40:31,608 --> 01:40:32,900
You want to give them that?

1132
01:40:33,027 --> 01:40:36,446
lt's better than him
being stuck here.

1133
01:40:36,572 --> 01:40:37,488
Nik...

1134
01:40:37,614 --> 01:40:39,115
you have to go.

1135
01:40:39,241 --> 01:40:40,783
Speak.
Why aren't you saying anything?

1136
01:40:41,452 --> 01:40:42,744
What do you want me to say?

1137
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:44,495
You always say
you're protecting this family,

1138
01:40:44,621 --> 01:40:47,290
and now
you're not saying a word.

1139
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:53,004
He should go.

1140
01:40:56,216 --> 01:40:58,968
My heart doesn't want it.

1141
01:41:01,221 --> 01:41:02,805
But it's his choice.

1142
01:41:04,224 --> 01:41:05,683
Not mine.

1143
01:41:21,283 --> 01:41:22,825
What about you?

1144
01:41:25,079 --> 01:41:26,496
What about me?

1145
01:41:26,997 --> 01:41:28,873
What are you going to do?

1146
01:41:29,666 --> 01:41:30,875
l don't know.

1147
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:33,669
l'll figure something out.

1148
01:41:34,296 --> 01:41:36,172
l'll be fine.
