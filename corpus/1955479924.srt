1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One last round gentlemen

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everybody!

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BURR:
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?

4
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:10,420
AARON BURR:
How does a bastard, orphan,
son of a whore and a Scotsman

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,980
Dropped in the middle of a
forgotten spot in the Caribbean

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:21,020
By providence, impoverished, in squalor
grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,620
JOHN LAURENS:
The ten-dollar Founding Father
without a father

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,000
Got a lot farther
by workin' a lot harder

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,240
By bein' a lot smarter
by bein' a self-starter

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,020
By fourteen, they placed him
in charge of a trading charter

11
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,200
THOMAS JEFFERSON:
And every day while slaves were
being slaughtered and carted away

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,460
Across the waves, he struggled
and kept his guard up

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,960
Inside, he was longing for
something to be a part of

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,940
The brother was ready to
beg, steal, borrow, or barter

15
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,780
JAMES MADISON:
Then a hurricane came
and devastation reigned

16
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,720
Our man saw his future drip,
drippin' down the drain

17
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,840
Put a pencil to his temple,
connected it to his brain

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,140
And he wrote his first refrain
a testament to his pain

19
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,420
BURR:
Well the word got around,
they said, "This kid is insane, man!"

20
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,400
Took up a collection just to
send him to the mainland

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,300
"Get your education, don't forget
from whence you came,

22
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,460
and the world's gonna know your name!
What's your name, man?"

23
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,540
ALEXANDER HAMILTON:
Alexander Hamilton

24
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,560
My name is Alexander Hamilton

25
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,540
And there's a million
things I haven't done
My name is Alexander Hamilton

26
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,940
And there's a million
things I haven't done

27
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:42,060
But just you wait,
just you wait

28
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,500
ELIZA SCHUYLAR:
When he was ten, his father split,
full of it, debt-ridden

29
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,400
Two years later, see Alex
and his mother, bed-ridden

30
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,800
Half-dead, sittin' in their own sick
The scent thick

31
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,580
And Alex got better
but his mother went quick

32
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,640
GEORGE WASHINGTON:
Moved in with a cousin,
the cousin committed suicide

33
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,160
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride,
somethin' new inside

34
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,240
A voice saying
"Alex you gotta fend for yourself"

35
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,300
He started retreatin' and readin'
every treatise on the shelf

36
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,360
BURR:
There would've been nothin' left to do
For someone less astute

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,040
He would've been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution

38
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,800
Started workin', clerkin'
for his late mother's landlord

39
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,340
Tradin' sugar cane and rum
and other things he can't afford

40
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,840
(Scammin') for every book
he can get his hands on

41
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,640
(Plannin') for the future, see him now
as he stands on (oooh)

42
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,860
The bow of a ship headed
for a new land

43
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,140
In New York you can be a new man

44
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:48,480
In New York you can be a new man
HAMILTON: Just you wait

45
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,920
In New York you can be a new man

46
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,180
In New York!
New York!

47
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,960
HAMILTON:
Just you wait!

48
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,340
Alexander Hamilton
(Alexander Hamilton)

49
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,880
We are waiting in the wings for you
(waiting in the wings for you)

50
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:09,080
You could never back down
You never learned to take your time!

51
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,520
Oh, Alexander Hamilton
(Alexander Hamilton)

52
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,520
When America sings for you

53
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:23,240
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?

54
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:31,100
The world will never be the same, oh

55
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,720
BURR:
The ship is in the harbor now,
see if you can spot him

56
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,000
Another immigrant
comin' up from the bottom

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,600
His enemies destroyed his rep,
America forgot him

58
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,580
MULLIGAN/MADISON & LAFAYETTE/JEFFERSON:
We fought with him!

59
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,260
LAURENS:
Me? I died for him!

60
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,020
WASHINGTON:
Me? I trusted him!

61
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,380
SCHUYLAR SISTERS:
Me? I loved him

62
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:53,300
BURR:
And me?
I'm the damn fool that shot him!

63
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:59,460
There's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait

64
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,180
BURR:
What's your name, man?

65
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,180
Alexander Hamilton!

66
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,080

67
67
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,960
New York City

68
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,780
HAMILTON:
Pardon me, are you Aaron Burr, sir?

69
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,400
BURR:
That depends, who's asking?

70
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,680
HAMILTON:
Oh well sure, sir

71
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,680
I'm Alexander Hamilton
I'm at your service, sir

72
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,180
I have been looking for you

73
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,220
BURR:
I'm getting nervous

74
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,100
HAMILTON:
Sir, I heard your name at Princeton

75
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,660
I was seeking an accelerated course of study

76
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,340
When I got sort out of sorts
with a buddy of yours

77
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,640
I may have punched him
It's a blur, sir

78
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,360
He handles the financials--

79
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,600
BURR:
You punched the bursar?

80
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,440
HAMILTON:
Yes, I wanted to do what you did

81
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,620
Graduate in two,
then join the revolution

82
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,440
He looked at me like I was stupid
I'm not stupid

83
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,440
So how'd you do it?
How'd you graduate so fast?

84
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,140
BURR:
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

85
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,600
HAMILTON:
You're an orphan! Of course!

86
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,580
I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!

87
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,580
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for

88
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,020
BURR:
Can I buy you a drink?

89
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,620
HAMILTON:
That would be nice

90
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,620
BURR:
While we're talking,
let me offer you some free advice

91
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,840
Talk less

92
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,400
HAMILTON:
What?

93
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,760
BURR:
Smile more

94
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,400
HAMILTON:
Ha

95
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,240
BURR:
Don't let them know what you're against
or what you're for

96
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,840
HAMILTON:
You can't be serious

97
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,200
BURR:
You want to get ahead?

98
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,040
HAMILTON:
Yes

99
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,260
BURR:
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

100
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,260
LAURENS:
Yo yo yo yo yo! What time is it?

101
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,400
LAURENS, MULLIGAN:
Showtime!

102
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,320
BURR:
...like I said...

103
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,320
LAURENS:
Showtime! Showtime! Yo!

104
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,900
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!

105
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,360
Uh, two pints o' Sam Adams,
but I'm working on three, uh!

106
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,760
Those redcoats don't want it with me

107
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,760
Cause I will pop chick-a-pop
these cops 'til I'm free!

108
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,760
LAFAYETTE:
Ah oui oui, mon ami,
je m'appelle Lafayette!

109
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,760
The Lancelot
of the revolutionary set!

110
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,760
I came from afar
just to say "Bonsoir!"

111
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,760
Tell the king, "Casse-toi!"
Who's the best? C'est moi!

112
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,160
MULLIGAN:
Brrrah, brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan

113
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,460
Up in it, lovin' it
Yes I heard your mother say "come again?"

114
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,360
Lock up your daughters and horses

115
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,320
Of course it's hard to have intercourse
over four sets of corsets

116
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,600
LAURENS:
No more sex

117
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more

118
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,540
LAURENS, LAFAYETTE, MULLIGAN:
To the revolution!

119
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,280
LAURENS:
Well if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton College

120
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,260
MULLIGAN:
Aaron Burr

121
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,260
LAURENS:
Give us a verse, drop some knowledge

122
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,960
BURR:
Good luck with that
You're takin' a stand

123
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,120
You spit, I'mma sit
We'll see where we land

124
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,120
LAURENS:
Burr, the revolution's imminent
What do you stall for?

125
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,120
HAMILTON:
If you stand for nothing, Burr,
what'll you fall for?

126
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,840
LAURENS, MULLIGAN, LAFAYETTE:
Oooh

127
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,360
LAURENS:
Who are you?

128
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:37,960
MULLIGAN:
Who are you?

129
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,740
LAFAYETTE:
Who are you?

130
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,300
Who, who is this kid?
What's he gonna do?

131
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,860
HAMILTON:
I am not throwing away my shot

132
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,300
I am not throwing away my shot

133
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,300
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry

134
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,460
And I'm not throwing away my shot!

135
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,760
I'mma get scholarship to King's College

136
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,440
I probably shouldn't brag,
but dag, I amaze and astonish

137
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,160
The problem is I got a lot of brains,
but no polish

138
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,500
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word I drop knowledge

139
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,280
I'm a diamond in the rough,
a shiny piece of coal

140
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,280
Tryin' to reach my goal,
my power of speech: unimpeachable

141
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,660
Only nineteen,
but my mind is older

142
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,040
These New York City streets
getting colder, I shoulder

143
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,720
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage

144
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,720
I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished

145
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,720
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame

146
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,480
But damn, it's getting dark,
so let me spell out my name

147
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,480
I am the--
A-L, E-X, A-N, D

148
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,800
E-R--we are--meant to be

149
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,580
HAMILTON:
A colony that runs independently

150
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,200
Meanwhile, Britain keeps
shitting on us endlessly

151
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,020
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly

152
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,600
Then King George turns around,
runs a spending spree

153
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,040
He ain't never gonna set
his descendants free

154
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,820
So there will be a revolution
in this century

155
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,680
Enter Me!

156
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,440
LAURENS, LAFAYETTE, MULLIGAN:
(He says in parentheses)

157
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,020
HAMILTON:
Don't be shocked when your
history book mentions me

158
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,700
I will lay down my life
if it sets us free

159
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,400
Eventually you'll see my ascendancy

160
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,140
And I am not throwing away my shot

161
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,500
I am not throwing away my shot

162
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,300
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry

163
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,820
HAMILTON & LAURENS:
And I'm not throwing away my shot

164
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,540
HAMILTON, MULLIGAN, LAURENS, LAFAYETTE:
I am not throwing away my shot

165
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,880
I am not throwing away my shot

166
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,980
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry

167
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,660
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

168
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,640
LAFAYETTE:
I dream of life without the monarchy

169
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,080
The unrest in France will lead to "onarchy"

170
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,080
"Onarchy?" How you say,
how you s--Oh, anarchy!

171
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,180
When I fight I make the other side panicky

172
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,020
With my
Shot!

173
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,760
MULLIGAN:
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice

174
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,540
And I got y'all knuckleheads
in loco parentis

175
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,760
I'm joining the rebellion
cuz I know it's my chance

176
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,440
To socially advance,
instead of sewin' some pants

177
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,740
I'm gonna take a
Shot!

178
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,400
LAURENS:
Eh, but we'll never be truly free

179
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,060
Until those in bondage
have the same rights as you and me

180
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,400
You and I, do or die,
wait till I sally in on a stallion

181
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,100
With the first black battalion

182
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,240
Have another
Shot!

183
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,040
BURR:
Geniuses, lower your voices

184
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,740
You keep out of trouble,
and you double your choices

185
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,060
I'm with you,
but the situation is fraught

186
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,100
You've got to be carefully taught:
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

187
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,420
HAMILTON:
Burr, check what we got

188
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,000
Mr. Lafayette hard rock like Lancelot

189
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,780
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot

190
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:06,820
Let's hatch a plot blacker
than the kettle callin' the pot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot

191
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,300
Let's hatch a plot blacker
than the kettle callin' the pot

192
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,100
What are the odds the gods
would put us all in one spot

193
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,820
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom,
like it or not

194
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,820
A bunch of revolutionary
manumission abolitionists

195
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,100
Give me a position,
show me where the ammunition is

196
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,600
Oh, am I talkin' too loud?

197
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,280
Sometimes I get over excited,
shoot off at the mouth

198
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,800
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

199
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,740
LAURENS:
Let's get this guy in front of a crowd!

200
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,920
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot

201
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,680
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry

202
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,280
And I'm not throwing away my shot

203
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,240
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot

204
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,460
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry

205
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,240
And I'm not throwing away my shot

206
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,160
LAURENS and (HAMILTON, LAFAYETTE, MULLIGAN):
Everybody sing

207
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,160
Woah-woah, wo-oh-oh
(Woah-woah, wo-oh-oh)

208
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,160
Hey
Wo-oh-oh (Wo-oh-oh)

209
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,240
Wooh!!
Wo-oh-oh (Wo-oh-oh)

210
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,080
Sing let 'em hear ya (Yeah)

211
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,080
Let's go!
(Woah-woah, wo-oh-oh)

212
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,080
I said, shout it to the rooftops
(Wo-oh-oh)

213
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,080
Said to the rooftops
(Wo-oh-oh)

214
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,420
Now come on
(Yeah)

215
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,320
Now come on, let's go

216
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,100
Rise up

217
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,860
When you're living on your knees,
you rise up

218
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,460
Tell your brother that
he's got to rise up

219
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,160
Tell your sister that
she's got to rise up

220
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:30,460
When are these colonies gonna rise up

221
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,460
When are these colonies gonna rise up
Rise up!

222
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,260
HAMILTON:
I imagine death so much
it feels more like a memory

223
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,560
When's it's gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?

224
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,340
If I see it coming,
do I run or do I let it be?

225
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,300
Is it like a beat without a melody?

226
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,660
See, I never thought I'd live
past twenty

227
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,320
Where I come from
some get half as many

228
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,160
Ask anybody why we livin'
fast and we laugh, reach for a flask

229
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,540
We have to make this moment last,
that's plenty

230
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,540
Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement

231
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,360
Where all the hungriest brothers
with something to prove went

232
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,760
Foes oppose us,
we take an honest stand

233
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,760
We roll like Moses,
claimin' our Promised Land

234
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,020
And? If we win our independence?

235
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,020
Is that a guarantee of
freedom for our descendants?

236
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,240
Or will the blood we shed
begin an endless

237
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,240
Cycle of vengeance and death
with no defendants?

238
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,140
I know the action in the street is excitin'

239
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,380
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' 'n fightin'
I've been readin' 'n writin'

240
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,160
We need to handle our financial situation

241
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,920
Are we a nation of states?
What's the state of our nation?

242
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,420
I'm past patiently waitin'!
I'm passionately smashin' every expectation

243
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,120
Every action's an act of creation

244
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,660
I'm laughin' in the face of
casualties and sorrow

245
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,860
For the first time,
I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

246
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:43,120
And I am not throwin' away my shot
I am not throwin' away my shot

247
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,120
Hey, yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry

248
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,680
And I'm not throwin' away my shot

249
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,280
We gonna rise up
time to take a shot
(Not thrown' away my shot)

250
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,860
We gonna rise up;
time to take a shot
(Not throwin' away my shot)

251
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,980
We gonna (rise up, rise up)
It's time to take a shot

252
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,640
(Rise up, rise up)
It's time to take a shot

253
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,500
(Rise up, rise up)
(Wo-oah) Time to take a shot (rise up)

254
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,500
Take a shot, a shot, a shot,
(Oh-Oh, oh)

255
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,940
A-yo, it's time to take a shot
(Woah, oh-oh oh)

256
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,960
Time to take a shot
(Woah-oh)

257
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,860
And I am (And I am)
Not throwing away my

258
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,360
Not throwing away my shot!

259
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,280
HAMILTON:
I may not live to see our glory

260
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,320
LAURENS, MULLIGAN, & LAFAYETTE:
I may not live to see our glory

261
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,380
HAMILTON:
But I will gladly join the fight

262
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,640
LAURENS, MULLIGAN, & LAFAYETTE:
But I will gladly join the fight

263
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,200
HAMILTON:
And when our children tell our story

264
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,260
LAURENS, MULLIGAN, & LAFAYETTE:
And when our children tell our story

265
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,880
HAMILTON:
They'll tell the story of tonight

266
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,120
MULLIGAN:
Let's have another round tonight

267
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,140
LAFAYETTE:
Let's have another round tonight

Let's have another round tonight

00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,720
LAURENS:
Raise a glass to freedom

270
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:49,840
Something they can never take away
No matter what they tell you

271
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,840
Raise a glass to the four of us

272
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,840
LAURENS and MULLIGAN:
Tomorrow there'll be more of us

273
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,080
LAURENS, MULLIGAN, & LAFAYETTE:
Telling the story of tonight

274
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,680
HAMILTON:

276
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,680

HAMILTON:
No matter what they tell you

278
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,900
MULLIGAN & LAFAYETTE:

279
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,800
LAURENS:
Raise a glass to the four of us

280
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,800
MULLIGAN, LAURENS, & LAFAYETTE:
Tomorrow there'll be more of us

281
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,800

Tonight

290

BURR:
There's nothing rich folks love more

291
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,780
Than going downtown
and slumming it with the poor

292
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,180
They pull up in their carriages and gawk

293
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,800
At the students in the common
Just to watch 'em talk

294
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,420
Take Philip Schuyler, the man is loaded
Uh oh, but little does he know

295
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,020
That his daughters,
Peggy, Angelica, Eliza

296
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,400
Sneak into the city
just to watch all the guys at

297
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,580

PEGGY:
Daddy said to be home by sundown

305
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,420
ANGELICA:
Daddy doesn't need to know

306
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,240
PEGGY:
Daddy said not to go downtown

307
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,960
ELIZA:
Like I said, you're free to go

308
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,200
ANGELICA:
But--look around, look around

309
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,120
The revolution's happening in New York

310
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,840
ELIZA & PEGGY:
New York

311
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,780
Angelica
Work!

312
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,500
PEGGY:
It's bad enough daddy wants to go to war

313
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,560
ELIZA:
People shouting in the square

314
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,040
PEGGY:
It's bad enough there'll be violence on our shore

315

New ideas in the air

316

Angelica, remind me what we're looking for

318
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,520
ALL MEN:
She's looking for me!

319
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,520
ANGELICA:
Eliza, I'm looking for a mind at work
(work, work)

320
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:58,240
I'm looking for a mind at work
(work, work)

321
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,460
Woa-oah, woa-oah
Work!

322
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,060
BURR:
Ooh, there's nothing like summer in the city

323
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,480
Someone in a rush
next to someone looking pretty

324
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,740
Excuse me, miss,
I know it's not funny

325
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,080
But your perfume smells
like your daddy's got money

326
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,400
Why you slummin' in the city
in your fancy heels?

327
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,860
You searchin' for an urchin
who can give you ideals?

328
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,340
ANGELICA:
Burr, you disgust me

329
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,900
BURR:
Ahh, so you've discussed me

330
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,780
I'm a trust fund, baby,
you can trust me

331
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,220
ANGELICA:
I've been reading Common Sense by Thomas Paine

332
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,580
So men say that I'm intense or I'm insane

333
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,400
You want a revolution?
I want a revelation!

334
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,120
So listen to my declaration:

335
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,640
"We hold these truths to be self-evident
That all men are created equal"

336
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,060
And when I meet Thomas Jefferson
I'mma compel him to include women in the sequel

337
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:39,980
Work!

00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,420

00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,420
ANGELICA, ELIZA & PEGGY:
History is happening in Manhattan and we

343
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,900
Just happen to be in the
greatest city in the world

344
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,420
In the greatest city in the world!

345
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,040
Cause I've been reading
Common Sense by Thomas Paine

346
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,740
So men say that
I'm intense or I'm insane

You want a revolution?
I want a revelation!

348
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,780
So listen to my declaration

349
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:12,600
We hold these truths to be self evident
That all men are created equal

350
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,660
Look around, look around
At how lucky we are to be alive right now

351
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,080
History is happening in Manhattan
And we just happen to be

352
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,080
In the greatest city in the world
(in the greatest city)

353
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,020
In the greatest city in the world!

We're looking for a mind at work

Hey (work, work)
Woah-ah! (work, work)

SEABURY:
Hear ye, hear ye!

365
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,200
My name is Samuel Seabury,
and I present

366
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,480
"Free thoughts on the proceedings
of the Continental Congress!"

367
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:10,600
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interest at heart

368
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,460
MULLIGAN:
Oh my god. Tear this dude apart

369
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:16,540
SEABURY:
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution

370
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:20,840
Don't let them lead you astray

371
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,840
This congress does not speak for me

372
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,820
BURR:
Let him be

373
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:30,480
SEABURY:
They're playing a dangerous game

374
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:39,860
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame!

375
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,180
HAMILTON:
Yo!

376
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,660
(Heed not the rabble who)
He'd have you all unravel

377
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,020
(Scream--)
At the sound of screams

378
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,640
(Revolution--)
But the revolution is comin'

379
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,840
(They have not your interests)
The have-nots are gonna win this

380
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,140
(At heart--)
It's hard to listen to you

381
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,400
with a straight face

382
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,180
(Chaos and bloodshed--)
Chaos and bloodshed

383
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,460
(Are not--)
Already haunt us

384
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,280
(A solution--)
Honestly, you shouldn't even talk--

385
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,780
(Don't let them lead you astray--)
And what about Boston?

386
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,320
Look at the cost of all that we've lost
And you talk about Congress?

387
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,920
SEABURY:
This Congress does not speak for me

388
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,140
HAMILTON:
My dog speaks more eloquently than thee

389
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,660
SEABURY:
You're playing a dangerous game

390
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,920
HAMILTON:
But strangely, your mange is the same!

391
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,760
SEABURY:
I pray the king shows you his mercy

392
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,080
HAMILTON:
Is he in Jersey?

393
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,860
SEABURY:
For shame--

394
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,380
HAMILTON:
For the Revolution!

395
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,380
SEABURY:
For shame!

396
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,120
For the Revolution!

397
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,620
SEABURY:
Heed--

398
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,660
If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna
(Scream--)

399
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,580
Honestly, look at me, please don't read!
(Not your interest--)

400
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,300
Don't modulate the key
then not debate with me

401
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:30,520
Why should a tiny island across the sea
Regulate the price of tea?

402
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,740
BURR:
Alexander, please!

403
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,420
HAMILTON:
Burr, I'd rather be divisive than indecisive
Drop the niceties

404
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:40,820
Silence! A message from the King!
A message from the King!

405
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:45,040
A message from the King!

406
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:59,980
You say the price of my love's
not a price that you're willing to pay

407
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:07,880
You cry in your tea which you hurl
in the sea when you see me go by

408
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:15,740
Why so sad? Remember we made
an arrangement when you went away

409
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,000
Now you're making me mad

410
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,560
Remember despite our estrangement,
I'm your man

411
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,660
You'll be back
Soon you'll see

412
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,140
You'll remember you belong to me

413
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:38,540
You'll be back
Time will tell

414
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,420
You'll remember that I served you well

415
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:50,020
Oceans rise, empires fall
We have seen each other through it all

416
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:54,040
And when push comes to shove,

417
00:19:54,040 --> 00:20:00,980
I will send a fully armed battalion
to remind you of my love

418
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:21,960
You say our love is draining
and you can't go on

419
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:30,580
You'll be the one complaining
when I am gone

420
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:38,100
And, no! don't change the subject
'Cause you're my favorite subject

421
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:45,600
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject

422
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:56,260
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever

423
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:00,340
You'll be back
Like before

424
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:04,020
I will fight the fight and win the war

425
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:08,100
For your love
For your praise

426
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,060
And I'll love you till my dying days

427
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:19,780
When you're gone, I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had

428
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:24,180
'Cause when push comes to shove

429
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:32,220
I will kill your friends and family
to remind you of my love

430
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:19,880
British Admiral Howe's
got troops on the water

431
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:32,180
Thirty-two thousand troops in
New York harbor

432
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:37,220
When they surround our troops!
They surround our troops!

433
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,080
They surround our troops!

434
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,120
HAMILTON:
As a kid in the Caribbean I wished for a war

435
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,440
I knew that I was poor
I knew it was the only way to--

436
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,620
Rise up!

437
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,140
HAMILTON:
If they tell my story

438
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,820
I am either gonna die on the
battlefield in glory or--

439
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,040
Rise up!

440
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,580
HAMILTON:
We will fight for this land

441
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,020
But there's only one man
Who can give us a command so we can--

442
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,160
Rise up!

443
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,140
HAMILTON:
Understand? It's the only way to--

444
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,300
Rise up! Rise up!

445
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,160
HAMILTON:
Here he comes!

446
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,700
Here comes the General!

447
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,220
BURR:
Ladies and gentlemen!

448
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,260
(Here comes the General!)
The moment you've been waiting for!

449
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,260
(Here comes the General!)
The pride of Mount Vernon!

450
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,580
(Here comes the General!)
George Washington!

451
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,540
WASHINGTON:
We are outgunned! (What?)

452
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,240
Outmanned!
(What?)

453
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,660
Outnumbered, outplanned!

454
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,660
We gotta make an all out stand

455
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,660
Ayo, I'm gonna need a
right-hand man.

456
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,220
Check it--
Can I be real a second?

457
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,900
For just a millisecond?

458
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,900
Let down my guard and tell the people
how I feel a second?

459
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,600
Now I'm the model of a
modern major general

460
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,140
The venerated Virginian veteran
whose men are all lining up

461
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,420
To put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives

462
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:49,520
Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room

463
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,020
The truth is in ya face
when ya hear the British cannons go--

464
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:53,880
Boom!

465
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,820
Any hope of success is fleeting

466
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:59,720
How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?

467
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,500
We put a stop to the bleeding
as the British take Brooklyn

468
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,220
Knight takes rook, but look
We are outgunned! (What?)

469
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,980
Outmanned!
(What?)

470
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,980
Outnumbered, outplanned!

471
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,540
We gotta make an all out stand

472
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,540
Ayo, I'm gonna need a
right-hand man

473
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,080
Incoming!

474
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,080
HAMILTON:
They're battering down the Battery check the damages

475
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,080
We gotta stop 'em and rob 'em
of their advantages

476
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,080
Let's take a stand with the stamina
God has granted us

477
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,080
Hamilton won't abandon ship
Yo, let's steal their cannons--

478
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,800
Shh-boom!
(Boom!)

479
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,520
WASHINGTON:
Goes the cannon

480
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,840
Watch the blood and the shit spray and--
(Boom!)

481
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,880
Goes the cannon, we're abandonin' Kips Bay and--
(Boom!)

482
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,320
There's another ship and--
(Boom!)

483
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,840
We just lost the southern tip and--
(Boom!)

484
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,520
We gotta run to Harlem quick,
we can't afford another slip

485
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,120
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up my forces

486
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,560
They're skittish as the
British cut the city up

487
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,560
This close to giving up,
facing mad scrutiny

488
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,220
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny:

489
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:00,220
Are these the men
with which I am to defend America?

490
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,220
We ride at midnight,
Manhattan in the distance

491
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:08,920
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I'm in dire need of assistance

492
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,280
BURR:
Your excellency, sir!

493
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:10,980
WASHINGTON:
Who are you?

494
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,300
BURR:
Aaron Burr, Sir?

495
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,900
Permission to state my case?

496
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,680
WASHINGTON
As you were

497
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,940
BURR:
Sir, I was a captain
under General Montgomery

498
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,620
Until he caught a bullet
in the neck in Quebec

499
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,840
And well, in summary

500
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,180
I think that I could be of some assistance

501
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:27,660
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

502
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,020
WASHINGTON:
Huh

503
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,820
BURR:
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions

504
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,880
On how to fight instead of fleeing west

505
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,780
WASHINGTON: Yes?
BURR: Well--

506
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,100
HAMILTON:
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

507
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,000
WASHINGTON:
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

508
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,420
HAMILTON:
Yes, sir

509
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,500
HAMILTON & BURR:
We keep meeting

510
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,380
BURR:
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to
seeing your strategy play out

511
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,180
WASHINGTON: Burr?
BURR: Sir?

512
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,940
WASHINGTON:
Close the door on your way out

513
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,460
HAMILTON:
Have I done something wrong, sir?

514
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,620
WASHINGTON:
On the contrary

515
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,620
I called you here because
our odds are beyond scary

516
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,480
Your reputation precedes you,
but I have to laugh

517
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,840
HAMILTON:
Sir?

518
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,540
WASHINGTON:
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

519
00:25:59,540 --> 00:25:59,900
HAMILTON:
Sir!

520
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,900
WASHINGTON:
Don't get me wrong, you're a young man, of great renown

521
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,900
I know you stole British cannons
when we were still downtown

522
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,380
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox
wanted to hire you...

523
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,500
HAMILTON:
To be their Secretary? I don't think so

524
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,100
WASHINGTON:
Why're you upset?

525
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:12,720
HAMILTON:
I'm not--

526
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,380
WASHINGTON:
It's alright, you want to fight, you've got a hunger

527
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,360
I was just like you when I was younger

528
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,360
Head full of fantasies of dyin' like a martyr?

529
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:20,820
HAMILTON:
Yes

530
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,820
WASHINGTON:
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder.

531
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,300
HAMILTON:
Why are you telling me this?

532
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,260
WASHINGTON:
I'm being honest

533
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,660
I'm working with a third of what
our Congress has promised

534
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:35,340
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

535
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:40,600
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!

536
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,440
Ayo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry!

537
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,320
HAMILTON:
I am not throwing away my shot!

538
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,660
WASHINGTON:
Son, we are outgunned, outmanned!

539
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,140
HAMILTON:
You need all the help you can get

540
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,800
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

541
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,600
WASHINGTON:
Outnumbered, outplanned!

542
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,160
HAMILTON:
We'll need some spies on the inside

543
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,660
Some King's men who might
let some things slide

544
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,420
(Boom!) I'll write to Congress
and tell 'em we need supplies

545
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,420
You rally the guys,
master the element of surprise

546
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:08,660
(Chicka-boom!) I'll rise above my station,
organize your information

547
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,700
'til we rise to the occasion
of our new nation. Sir!

548
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,200
Here comes the General!

549
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,620
HAMILTON:
Rise up! (What?)

550
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,140
Here comes the General!

551
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,660
HAMILTON:
Rise up! (What?)

552
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,140
Here comes the General!

553
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,620
HAMILTON:
Rise up! (What?)

554
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,820
Here comes the General!

555
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,820
WASHINGTON:
And his right hand man!

556
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,460
Boom!

557
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,180
BURR:
How does the bastard, orphan,

558
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:42,560
Son of a whore go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?

559
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:46,900
Watch this obnoxious,
arrogant, loudmouth bother

560
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,720
Be seated at the right hand of the father

561
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:56,660
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write

562
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:02,680
Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common?

563
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,520
We're reliable with the
Ladies!

564
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,040
BURR:
There are so many to deflower!

565
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,140
Ladies!

566
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,640
BURR:
Looks! Proximity to power

567
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,880
Ladies!

568
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,060
BURR:
They delighted and distracted him

569
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,820
Martha Washington named her
feral tomcat after him!

570
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,720
HAMILTON:
That's true

571
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,180

572
572
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,060
BURR:
A winter's ball

573
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:31,660
And the Schuyler sisters are the envy of all
Yo, if you can marry a sister, you're rich, son

574
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,300
HAMILTON:
Is it a question of if, Burr, or which one?

575
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:47,140
ELIZA:
Ohh, I do I do I do I dooo

576
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:52,420
Hey!
Ohh, I do I do I do I dooo!

577
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:56,880
Boy you got me helpless!

578
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:02,280
Look into your eyes,
and the sky's the limit I'm helpless!

579
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,340
Down for the count,
and I'm drownin' in 'em

580
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,420
ELIZA:
I have never been the type
to try and grab the spotlight

581
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:12,580
We were at a revel
with some rebels on a hot night

582
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,580
Laughin' at my sister
as she's dazzling the room

583
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,580
Then you walked in
and my heart went "Boom!"

584
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:21,580
Tryin' to catch your eye
from the side of the ballroom

585
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,580
Everybody's dancin' and
the band's top volume

586
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,580
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine

587
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:30,980
Grab my sister, and whisper,
"Yo, this one's mine."

588
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,580
My sister made her way
across the room to you

589
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,820
And I got nervous, thinking
"What's she gonna do?"

590
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,820
She grabbed you by the arm,
I'm thinkin' "I'm through"

591
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,640
Then you look back at me
and suddenly I'm helpless!

592
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,640
Oh, look at those eyes
(Look into your eyes)

593
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,920
(And the sky's the limit)
I'm helpless

594
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:55,000
I know
(Down for the count and I'm drownin in 'em)

595
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
(I'm helpless!)
I'm so into you

596
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
(Look into your eyes and the sky's the limit)
I am so into you

597
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I'm helpless!
I know I'm

598
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in 'em.

599
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,960
HAMILTON:
Where are you taking me?

600
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,700
ANGELICA:
I'm about to change your life

601
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,360
HAMILTON:
Then by all means, lead the way

602
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,360
ELIZA:
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

603
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,080
HAMILTON:
Schuyler?

604
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,060
ANGELICA:
My sister

605
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,040
ELIZA:
Thank you for all your service

606
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,040
HAMILTON:
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet,
it will have been worth it

607
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,980
ANGELICA:
I'll leave you to it

608
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,460
ELIZA:
One week later I'm writing a letter nightly

609
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,460
Now my life gets better,
every letter that you write me

610
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,460
Laughin' at my sister,
cuz she wants to form a harem

611
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,140
ANGELICA:
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me,
you would share him

612
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:37,600
ELIZA:
Ha!

613
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,600
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin'

614
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,600
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'

615
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,600
I'm dying inside, as you wine and dine

616
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,480
And I'm tryin' not to cry 'cause
there's nothing that your mind can't do

617
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,600
My father makes his way
across the room to you

618
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,000
I panic for a second, thinking
"we're through"

619
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
But then he shakes your hand
and says "be true"

620
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,200
And you turn back to me,
smiling, and I'm (Helpless)

621
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,200
(Look into your eyes
and the sky's the limit I'm)

622
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,200
Helpless!
(Helpless)

623
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,200
(Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in 'em)

624
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,200
(Helpless)
That boy

625
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,740
is mine (Look into your eyes
and the sky's the limit)

626
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,680
(I'm helpless!)
Helpless

627
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,020
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in 'em

628
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:29,020
HAMILTON:
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name

629
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,020
An acre of land, a troop to command,
a dollop of fame

630
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:35,300
All I have's my honor,
a tolerance for pain

631
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,300
A couple of college credits
and my top-notch brain

632
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,300
Insane, your family brings out
a different side of me

633
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,300
Peggy confides in me,
Angelica tried to take a bite of me

634
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,020
No stress, my love for you
is never in doubt

635
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:50,020
We'll get a little place in Harlem
and we'll figure it out

636
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,020
I've been livin' without a family
since I was a child

637
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,020
My father left, my mother died,
I grew up buckwild

638
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:59,020
But I'll never forget my mother's face,
that was real

639
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:02,280
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so--

640
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,280
(Helpless!)
ELIZA: I do I do I do I do!

641
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,000
HAMILTON: Eliza...
(Helpless!)

642
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
ELIZA: I do I do I do I do!
HAMILTON: I've never felt so--

643
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
(Helpless)
ELIZA: Hey, yeah, yeah!

644
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,240
(Down for the count)

645
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,860
I'm down for the count I'm--
(And I'm drownin' in 'em)

646
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,860
(Helpless)
HAMILTON: My life is gon' be fine cuz Eliza's in it

647
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:24,360
I look into your eyes,
and the sky's the limit I'm--

648
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,720
(Helpless!
Down for the count and I'm)

649
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,340
drownin' in 'em

650
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:45,500
In New York, you can be a new man...

651
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,500
ELIZA:
Helpless

652
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:57,860
LAURENS:
Alright, alright. That's what I'm talkin' about!

653
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:07,200
Now everyone give it up for
the maid of honor, Angelica Schuyler!

654
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,500
ANGELICA:
A toast to the groom! (To the groom!)

655
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,460
To the bride!
(To the bride!)

656
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,320
From your sister,
(Angelica)

657
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,040
Who is always by your side.
(By your side!)

658
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:27,080
To your union,
(To the union! To the revolution!)

659
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,080
and the hope that you provide.
(You provide!)

660
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,700
May you always...
(Always–)

661
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:39,100
be satisfied.
(Rewind–)

662
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:04,460
I remember that night, I just might
regret that night for the rest of my days.

663
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:08,300
I remember those soldier boys
tripping over themselves to win our praise.

664
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,080
I remember that dreamlike candlelight
like a dream that you can't quite place,

665
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:16,620
but Alexander, I'll never forget
the first time I saw your face.

666
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:23,240
I have never been the same,
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame,

667
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:29,740
And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name,
set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame,

668
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,700
This is not a game...

669
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,360
HAMILTON:
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied.

670
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:39,180
ANGELICA:
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You forget yourself.

671
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:43,360
HAMILTON:
You're like me. I'm never satisfied.

672
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,000
ANGELICA:
Is that right?

673
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
HAMILTON:
I have never been satisfied.

674
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,000
ANGELICA:
My name is Angelica Schuyler.

675
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,060
HAMILTON:
Alexander Hamilton.

676
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,260
ANGELICA:
Where's your fam'ly from?

677
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:01,880
HAMILTON:
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't
done but just you wait, just you wait...

678
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,820
ANGELICA:
So so so--

679
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,460
So this is what it feels like to match
wits with someone at your level!

680
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,680
What the hell is the catch?
It's the feeling of freedom,

681
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,920
of seein' the light,
it's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite!

682
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,980
You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes,

683
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,460
maybe three minutes,
ev'rything we said in total agreement,

684
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,020
it's a dream and it's a bit of a dance,
a bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance.

685
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,080
He's a bit of a flirt,
but I'm 'a give it a chance.

686
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,040
I asked about his fam'ly,
did you see his answer?

687
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,840
His hands started fidgeting,
he looked askance?

688
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,880
He's penniless, he's flying
by the seat of his pants.

689
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:30,040
Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!

690
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,680
I wanna take him far away from this place,
then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...

691
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,300
ELIZA:
Helpless...

692
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,620
ANGELICA:
And I know she is...

693
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,060
ELIZA:
Helpless...

694
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,400
ANGELICA:
And her eyes are just...

695
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,160
ELIZA:
Helpless...

696
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,980
ANGELICA:
And I realize

697
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:49,560
Three fundamental truths
at the exact same time...

698
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,120
HAMILTON
Where are you taking me?

699
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,520
ANGELICA
I'm about to change your life.

700
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,000
HAMILTON
Then by all means, lead the way.

701
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,140
(Number one!)
ANGELICA: I'm a girl in a world in which
my only job is to marry rich.

702
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:02,680
My father has no sons so I'm
the one who has to social climb for one,

703
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,200
so I'm the oldest and the wittiest
and the gossip in New York City is insidious,

704
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,840
And Alexander is penniless, Ha!
That doesn't mean I want him any less.

705
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,840
ELIZA:
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you.

706
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,360
HAMILTON: Schuyler?
ANGELICA: My sister!

707
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:16,380
(Number two!)
ANGELICA:
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister.
HAMILTON: Schuyler?
ANGELICA: My sister!

708
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:19,000
(Number two!)
ANGELICA:
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister.

709
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,060
That elevates his status,
I'd have to be naïve to set that aside,

710
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:28,400
maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza,
now that's his bride.

711
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,280
Nice going, Angelica, he was right,
You will never be satisfied.

712
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,180
ELIZA:
Thank you for all your service.

713
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:37,180
HAMILTON:
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet,
it will have been worth it.

714
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,160
ANGELICA
I'll leave you to it.

715
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,500
(Number three!)
ANGELICA:
I know my sister like I know my own mind

716
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,600
you will never find anyone
as trusting or as kind.

717
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:52,660
If I tell her that I love him she'd
be silently resigned, he'd be mine.

718
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,660
She would say, "I'm fine"
She'd be lying.

719
00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:00,080
But when I fantasize at night
it's Alexander's eyes,

720
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:07,400
as I romanticize what might have been
if I hadn't sized him up so quickly.

721
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:17,960
At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
at least I keep his eyes in my life...

722
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,300
To the groom!
(To the groom!)

723
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,380
To the bride!
(To the bride!)

724
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,380
From your sister,
(Angelica)

725
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:37,380
Who is always by your side.
(By your side)

726
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,540
To your union,
(To the union! To the revolution!)

727
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:45,500
and the hope that you provide.
(You provide!)

728
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,060
May you always
(Always–)

729
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,060
be satisfied.
(be satisfied)

730
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:56,260
And I know
(be satisfied)

731
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:00,500
She'll be happy as his bride

732
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,500
And I know

733
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:13,940
He will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied

734
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,780
LAURENS:
I may not live to see our glory!

735
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,780
MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE:
I may not live to see our glory!

736
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,780
LAURENS
But I've seen wonders great and small.

737
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,780
MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE:
I've seen wonders great and small.

738
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,780
LAURENS:
Cuz if the tomcat can get married,

739
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,780
MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE:
If Alexander can get married-

740
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,040
LAURENS:
There's hope for our ass, after all!

741
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,240
LAFAYETTE:
Raise a glass to freedom.

742
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,860
LAURENS/MULLIGAN:
Hey! Something you will never see again!

743
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,860
MULLIGAN:
No matter what she tells you.

744
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:54,860
LAFAYETTE:
Let's have another round tonight!

745
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,940
LAURENS
Raise a glass to the four of us!

746
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,660
LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON:
Ho!

747
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,000
MULLIGAN:
To the newly not poor of us!

748
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,940
LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON:
Woo!

749
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,940
LAFAYETTE:
We'll tell the story of tonight.

750
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,040
LAURENS:
Let's have another round-

751
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,920
HAMILTON:
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr.

752
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,500
BURR:
Sir!

753
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,100
HAMILTON:
I didn't think that you would make it.

754
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,000
BURR:
To be sure.

755
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,480
MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE:
Burr!

756
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,940
BURR:
I came to say congratulations.

757
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,380
MULLIGAN:
Spit a verse, Burr!

758
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,800
BURR:
I see the whole gang is here.

759
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,520
LAFAYETTE:
You are the worst, Burr!

760
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,520
HAMILTON:
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel.

761
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,240
I wish I had your command
instead of manning George's journal.

762
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,000
BURR:
No, you don't.

763
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,720
HAMILTON:
Yes, I do.

764
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,960
BURR:
Now, be sensible.

765
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,680
From what I hear,
you've made yourself indispensable.

766
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,840
LAURENS:
Well, well, I heard

767
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,840
You've got a special someone
on the side, Burr.

768
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,580
HAMILTON:
Is that so?

769
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,460
LAURENS:
What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

770
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,220
BURR:
I should go.

771
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,720
HAMILTON:
No, these guys should go.

772
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,320
LAFAYETTE: What?
LAURENS: No!

773
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,180
HAMILTON:
Leave us alone.

774
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,000
MULLIGAN:
Man...

775
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,580
HAMILTON:
It's alright, Burr.

776
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,280
I wish you'd brought this girl
with you tonight, Burr.

777
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,060
BURR:
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir.

778
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:48,800
HAMILTON:
What do you mean?

779
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,760
BURR:
She's married.

780
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,240
HAMILTON:
I see.

781
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,420
BURR:
She's married to a British officer.

782
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,280
HAMILTON:
Oh shit...

783
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,720
BURR:
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more.

784
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,180
I'll see you on the other side of the war.

785
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:05,180
HAMILTON:
I will never understand you.

786
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:10,640
If you love this woman, go get here!
What are you waiting for?

787
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,920
BURR:
I'll see you on the other side of the war.

788
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,920
HAMILTON:
I'll see you on the other side of the war.

789
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:32,040
BURR
Theodosia writes me a letter ev'ry day.

790
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,020
I'm keeping her bed warm
while her husband is away.

791
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:43,000
He's on the British side of Georgia.
He's tryin' to keep the colonies in line.

792
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:48,000
Well he can keep all of Georgia.
Theodosia, she's mine.

793
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:51,760
Love doesn't discriminate
between the sinners and the saints,

794
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,760
it takes and it takes and it takes
and we keep loving anyway.

795
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,340
We laugh and we cry and we break
and we make our mistakes.

796
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:02,900
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
when so many have tried

797
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:08,100
then I'm willing to wait for it.
I'm willing to wait for it.

798
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:13,060
My grandfather was a fire
of brimstone preacher,

799
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:18,120
But there are things that the
homilies and hymns won't teach ya.

800
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,680
My mother was a genius

801
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,980
My father commanded respect.

802
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:29,300
When they died they left no instructions.
Just a legacy to protect.

803
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,300
Death doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints,

804
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,840
it takes and it takes and it takes
and we keep living anyway.

805
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,600
We rise and we fall and we break
and we make our mistakes.

806
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,880
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
when everyone who loves me has died

807
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,160
I'm willing to wait for it.
I'm willing to wait for it.

808
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,540
Wait for it!
(Wait for it)

809
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:57,100
I am the one thing in life I can control
(Wait for it!)

810
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:01,100
I am inimitable, I am an original
(Wait for it)

811
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:07,100
I'm not falling behind or running late
(Wait for it)

812
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:11,660
I'm not standing still,
I am lying in wait (Wait)

813
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,100
Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb
(Climb)

814
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,180
He has something to prove
He has nothing to lose (Lose)

815
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:27,160
Hamilton's pace is relentless
he wastes no time (Time)

816
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:36,160
What's it like in his shoes?
Hamilton doesn't hesitate.

817
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,700
He exhibits no restraint.
He takes and he takes and he takes

818
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,740
And he keeps winning anyway.
He changes the game.

819
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,640
He plays and he raises the stakes.

820
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,360
And if there's a reason he seems to thrive
when so few survive,

821
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,360
then Goddamnit I'm willing to wait for it.
(Wait for it)

822
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,360
I'm willing to wait for it...

823
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,880
Life doesn't discriminate
between the sinners and the saints

824
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,880
it takes and it takes and it takes

825
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,120
We rise.
We fall.

826
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,840
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many others have died,

827
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,180
then I'm willin' to-

828
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:20,200
Wait for it
(Wait for it)

829
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:42,700
ELIZA:
Stay alive...

830
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:48,380
ELIZA/ANGELICA:
Stay alive...

831
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,480
HAMILTON:
I have never seen the General so despondent

832
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,480
I have taken over writing
all his correspondence

833
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,480
Congress writes,
"George, attack the British forces."

834
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,480
I shoot back, we have resorted
to eating our horses

835
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,920
Local merchants deny us
equipment, assistance

836
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,440
They only take British money,
so sing a song of sixpence

837
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,580
WASHINGTON:
The cavalry's not coming

838
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,100
HAMILTON:
But, sir!

839
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,680
WASHINGTON:
Alex, listen. There's only one way for us to win this

840
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,400
Provoke outrage, outright

841
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,000
HAMILTON:
That's right

842
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
WASHINGTON:
Don't engage, strike by night

843
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,480
Remain relentless 'til
their troops take flight

844
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,920
HAMILTON:
Make it impossible to justify
the cost of the fight

845
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,740
WASHINGTON: Outrun
HAMILTON: Outrun

846
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,300
WASHINGTON: Outlast
HAMILTON: Outlast

847
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,020
WASHINGTON:
Hit 'em quick, get out fast

848
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:31,920
HAMILTON:
Chick-a-plao!

849
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,920
WASHINGTON:
Stay alive 'til this horror show is past

850
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,300
We're gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast

851
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,020
HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE:
Raise a glass!

852
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:41,020
MULLIGAN:
I go back to New York and my apprenticeship

853
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:44,020
LAFAYETTE:
I ask for French aid,
I pray that France has sent a ship

854
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:47,140
LAURENS:
I stay at work with Hamilton
We write essays against slavery

855
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:50,140
And every day's a test of our
camaraderie and bravery

856
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:53,140
HAMILTON:
We cut supply lines, we steal contraband

857
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:56,140
We pick and choose our battles
and places to take a stand

858
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:59,140
And ev'ry day
"Sir, entrust me with a command,"

859
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,520
And ev'ry day
WASHINGTON: No

860
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,140
HAMILTON:
He dismisses me out of hand

861
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:05,140
HAMILTON:
Instead of me he promotes Charles Lee

862
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:08,580
Makes him second-in-command.
LEE: I'm a General. Whee!!!!

863
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:11,280
HAMILTON:
Yeah. He's not the choice I would have gone with

864
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,680
HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE:
He shits the bed at the Battle of Monmouth

865
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,840
WASHINGTON: Ev'ryone attack!
LEE: Retreat!

866
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:15,860
WASHINGTON: Attack!
LEE: Retreat!
WASHINGTON: Ev'ryone attack!
LEE: Retreat!

867
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,460
WASHINGTON: Attack!
LEE: Retreat!

868
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:20,120
WASHINGTON:
What are you doing, Lee?
Get back on your feet!

869
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,120
LEE:
But there's so many of them!

870
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,360
WASHINGTON:
I'm sorry, is this not your speed?!

871
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,580
Hamilton!
HAMILTON: Ready, sir!

872
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,140
WASHINGTON:
Have Lafayette take the lead!

873
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:26,740
HAMILTON:
Yes, sir!

874
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:29,080
LAURENS:
A thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree heat

875
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:32,080
LAFAYETTE:
As we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat

876
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,340
HAMILTON:
Charles Lee was left behind without a pot to piss in

877
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:38,340
He started sayin' this to
anybody who would listen:

878
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:41,940
LEE:
Washington cannot be left alone to his devices

879
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,400
Indecisive, from crisis to crisis

880
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,700
The best thing he can do for the revolution

881
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:49,700
Is turn n' go back to plantin'
tobacco in Mount Vernon

882
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:53,260
WASHINGTON:
Don't do a thing. History will prove him wrong

883
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:53,960
HAMILTON:
But, sir!

884
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,440
WASHINGTON:
We have a war to fight, let's move along

885
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:59,180
LAURENS:
Strong words from Lee, someone oughta hold him to it

886
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:01,820
HAMILTON:
I can't disobey direct orders

887
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,520
LAURENS:
Then I'll do it

888
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,660
Alexander,
you're the closest friend I've got

889
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:11,380
HAMILTON:
Laurens, do not throw away your shot

890
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:18,480
One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

891
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,480
BURR/HAMILTON/LAURENS/LEE:
It's the Ten Duel Commandments

892
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,480
It's the Ten Duel Commandments

893
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,980
(Number one!)
LAURENS:
The challenge: demand satisfaction

894
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:32,600
If they apologize,
no need for further action

895
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,800
(Number two!)
If they don't, grab a friend, that's your second

896
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,800
HAMILTON:
Your lieutenant when there's reckoning to be reckoned

897
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,800
(Number three!)
LEE:
Have your seconds meet face to face

898
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,240
BURR:
Negotiate a peace...

899
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,460
HAMILTON:
Or negotiate a time and place

900
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:48,140
BURR:
This is commonplace, 'specially 'tween recruits

901
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:52,020
Most disputes die, and no one shoots
Number four!

902
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,220
LAURENS:
If they don't reach a peace, that's alright

903
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:57,220
Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site.

904
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:00,580
HAMILTON:
You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility

905
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:03,580
BURR:
You have him turn around so he can have deniability

906
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:06,580
(Five!)
LEE:
Duel before the sun is in the sky

907
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:10,460
Pick a place to die where it's high and dry
Number six!

908
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,460
HAMILTON:
Leave a note for your next of kin

909
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:16,000
Tell 'em where you been.
Pray that hell or heaven lets you in.

910
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,700
(Seven!)
LEE:
Confess your sins.

911
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:21,840
Ready for the moment of adrenaline
when you finally face your opponent

912
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,840
(Number eight!)
LAURENS/LEE/HAMILTON/BURR:
Your last chance to negotiate

913
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:28,380
Send in your seconds,
see if they can set the record straight.

914
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,060
BURR: Alexander
HAMILTON: Aaron Burr, sir

915
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:33,420
BURR:
Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?

916
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:37,220
HAMILTON:
Sure, but your man has to answer for his words, Burr

917
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:40,220
BURR:
With his life? We both know that's absurd, sir

918
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:44,500
HAMILTON:
Hang on, how many men died because
Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?

919
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,060
BURR:
Okay, so we're doin' this

920
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:49,740
(Number nine!)
HAMILTON:
Look 'em in the eye, aim no higher

921
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:53,180
Summon all the courage you require
Then count

922
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:56,520
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine

923
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,640
Number ten paces!

924
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,180
HAMILTON/BURR:
Fire!

925
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,260
HAMILTON:
Lee, do you yield?

926
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,500
BURR:
You shot him in the side! Yes, he yields!

927
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,740
LAURENS:
I'm satisfied

928
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:07,060
BURR:
Yo, we gotta clear the field!

929
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,060
HAMILTON:
Go! We won.

930
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:09,380
Here comes the General!

931
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,540
BURR:
This should be fun

932
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:14,280
WASHINGTON:
What is the meaning of this?
Mr. Burr, get a medic for the General

933
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,100
BURR:
Yes, sir

934
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,100
WASHINGTON:
Lee, you will never agree with me

935
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,760
But believe me,
these young men don't speak for me

936
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,480
Thank you for your service

937
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,120
BURR:
Let's ride!

938
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,480
WASHINGTON: Hamilton!
HAMILTON: Sir!

939
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,840
WASHINGTON:
Meet me inside

940
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:28,720
Meet him inside! Meet him inside!
Meet him inside, meet him, meet him inside!

941
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,700
WASHINGTON: Son--
HAMILTON: Don't call me son

942
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,500
WASHINGTON:
This war is hard enough without infighting

943
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,500
HAMILTON:
Lee called you out. We called his bluff.

944
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,200
WASHINGTON:
You solve nothing, you aggravate our allies to the south

945
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,780
HAMILTON:
You're absolutely right,
John should have shot him in the mouth

946
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:41,680
That would've shut him up

947
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,820
WASHINGTON: Son
HAMILTON: I'm notcha son

948
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:43,580
WASHINGTON:
Watch your tone

949
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:47,280
I am not a maiden in need of defending, I am grown
HAMILTON: Charles Lee, Thomas Conway

950
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,600
These men take your name
and they rake it through the mud

951
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,680
WASHINGTON:
My name's been through a lot, I can take it

952
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,720
HAMILTON:
Well, I don't have your name.

953
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,720
I don't have your titles
I don't have your land

954
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,860
But, if you
WASHINGTON: No.

955
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:58,180
HAMILTON:
If you gave me command of a battalion,

956
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:01,800
a group of men to lead,
I could fly above my station after the war

957
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,060
WASHINGTON:
Or you could die and we need you alive

958
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:05,420
HAMILTON:
I'm more than willing to die

959
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:07,840
WASHINGTON:
Your wife needs you alive, son, I need you alive

960
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,400
HAMILTON:
Call me son one more time!

961
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,980
WASHINGTON:
Go home, Alexander

962
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,160
That's an order from your commander

963
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,580
HAMILTON: Sir
WASHINGTON: Go home!

964
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,900
ELIZA:
Look around, look around

965
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:34,220
At how lucky we are
to be alive right now

966
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:38,520
Look around, look around...

967
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,020
HAMILTON:
How long have you known?

968
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:42,840
ELIZA:
A month or so

969
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,380
HAMILTON:
Eliza, you should have told me

970
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:48,620
ELIZA: I wrote to the General a month ago
HAMILTON: No

971
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:50,720
ELIZA:
I begged him to send you home

972
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,340
HAMILTON:
You should have told me

973
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:55,340
ELIZA:
I'm not sorry

974
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,300
I knew you'd fight until the war was won
HAMILTON: The war's not Done.

975
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:02,660
ELIZA:
But you deserve a chance to meet your son

976
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:09,600
Look around, look around at how lucky
we are to be alive right now.

977
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,600
HAMILTON:
Will you relish being a poor man's wife

978
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,300
Unable to provide for your life?

979
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:18,300
ELIZA:
I relish being your wife

980
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:24,540
Look around, look around...

981
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:30,600
Look at where you are
Look at where you started

982
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:37,320
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough

983
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:45,200
And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile

984
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:51,460
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough

985
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:59,420
I don't pretend to know
The challenges you're facing

986
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:06,040
The worlds you keep erasing
and creating in your mind

987
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:12,360
But I'm not afraid
I know who I married

988
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:16,700
So long as you come home
at the end of the day

989
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,700
That would be enough

990
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:25,780
We don't need a legacy
We don't need money

991
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:33,700
If I could grant you peace of mind
If you could let me inside your heart...

992
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:40,680
Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday

993
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:49,020
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay

994
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:57,520
And I could be enough
And we could be enough

995
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:03,060
That would be enough

996
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,400
BURR:
How does a ragtag volunteer army

997
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,680
In need of a shower
somehow defeat a global superpower?

998
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:32,440
How do we emerge victorious
from the quagmire?

999
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,020
Leave the battlefield waving
Betsy Ross' flag higher?

1000
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:39,020
Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!

1001
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:42,360
An immigrant you know and love
who's unafraid to step in!

1002
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:46,180
He's constantly confusin',
confoundin' the British henchmen

1003
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:49,880
Ev'ryone give it up for America's
favorite fighting Frenchman!

1004
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:50,680
Lafayette!

1005
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,500
LAFAYETTE:
I'm takin this horse by the reins makin'
Redcoats redder with bloodstains

1006
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,640
(Lafayette!) And I'm never gonna stop until I make 'em
Drop and burn 'em up and scatter their remains, I'm

1007
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,140
(Lafayette!) Watch me engagin' em!
Escapin' em! Enragin' em! I'm--

1008
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:02,160
(Lafayette!)
I go to France for more funds

1009
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,240
(Lafayette!)
I come back with more guns

1010
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,220
And ships
And so the balance shifts

1011
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:07,240
WASHINGTON:
We rendezvous with Rochambeau,
consolidate their gifts
And ships
And so the balance shifts

1012
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:10,360
WASHINGTON:
We rendezvous with Rochambeau,
consolidate their gifts

1013
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:14,040
LAFAYETTE:
We can end this war at Yorktown,
cut them off at sea, but

1014
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:17,620
For this to succeed, there is someone else we need
WASHINGOTN: I know

1015
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,340
Hamilton!

1016
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:21,340
LAFAYETTE:
Sir, he knows what to do in a trench
Ingenuitive and fluent in French, I mean--

1017
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:24,580
(Hamilton!) Sir, you're gonna have to use him eventually
What's he gonna do on the bench? I mean--

1018
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:28,060
(Hamilton!) No one has more resilience
Or matches my practical tactical brilliance--

1019
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:29,840
(Hamilton!)
You wanna fight for your land back?

1020
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,620
(Hamilton!)
WASHINGTON:
I need my right hand man back!

1021
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,580
LAFAYETTE:
Ah! Uh, get ya right hand man back

1022
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,020
You know you gotta get
ya right hand man back

1023
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:38,640
I mean you gotta put some thought into the letter but
the sooner the better to get your right hand man back!

1024
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,080
WASHINGTON:
Alexander Hamilton

1025
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:44,580
Troops are waiting in the field for you

1026
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:52,200
If you join us right now,
together we can turn the tide

1027
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:58,600
Oh, Alexander Hamilton
I have soldiers that will yield for you

1028
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:06,260
If we manage to get this right
They'll surrender by early light

1029
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:17,760
The world will never be the same,
Alexander...

1030
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:35,860
I was younger than you are now
When I was given my first command

1031
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:43,180
I led my men straight into a massacre
I witnessed their deaths firsthand

1032
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:49,560
I made every mistake
I felt the shame rise in me

1033
00:54:49,560 --> 00:55:00,940
And even now I lie awake
Knowing history has its eyes on me

1034
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:11,820
History has its eyes on me.

1035
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:27,320
Let me tell you what I wish I'd known
When I was young and dreamed of glory:

1036
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:33,440
You have no control
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story

1037
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:39,500
I know that we can win
I know that greatness lies in you

1038
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:46,960
But remember from here on in
History has its eyes on you.

1039
00:55:55,520 --> 00:56:01,780
History has its eyes on you

1040
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,300
The battle of Yorktown

1041
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:16,260

1042
1042
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,140
LAFAYETTE: Monsieur Hamilton
HAMILTON: Monsieur Lafayette

1043
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:22,140
LAFAYETTE: In command where you belong
HAMILTON: How you say, no sweat

1044
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,460
We're finally on the field,
We've had quite a run.

1045
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:27,460
LAFAYETTE: Immigrants
HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE: We get the job done

1046
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:30,460
HAMILTON: So what happens if we win?
LAFAYETTE: I go back to France

1047
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,700
I bring freedom to my people
if I'm given the chance

1048
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:33,980
HAMILTON:
We'll be with you when you do

1049
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,180
LAFAYETTE:
Go lead your men

1050
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:36,360
HAMILTON:
See you on the other side

1051
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,940
LAFAYETTE:
'Til we meet again, let's go!

1052
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:42,380
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!

1053
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:45,100
Hey yo, I'm just like my country,
I'm young scrappy and hungry

1054
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:49,780
And I'm not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!

1055
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:52,780
HAMILTON:
'Til the world turns upside down...

1056
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:56,960
'Til the world turns upside down!

1057
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,240
I imagine death so much
it feels more like a memory

1058
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:02,240
This is where it gets me: on my feet
The enemy ahead of me

1059
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,020
If this is the end of me,
at least I have a friend with me

1060
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:07,520
Weapon in my hand, a command,
and my men with me

1061
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:12,200
Then I remember my Eliza's expecting me...
Not only that, my Eliza's expecting

1062
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,300
We gotta go, gotta get the job done

1063
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,760
Gotta start a new nation,
gotta meet my son!

1064
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,420
Take the bullets out your gun!
(What?)

1065
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:18,440
The bullets out your gun!
(What?)
Take the bullets out your gun!
(What?)

1066
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,720
The bullets out your gun!
(What?)

1067
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,640
We move under cover and we move as one

1068
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,180
Through the night, we have
one shot to live another day

1069
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,440
We cannot let a stray
gunshot give us away

1070
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:29,440
We will fight up close,
seize the moment and stay in it

1071
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,880
It's either that or meet the
business end of a bayonet

1072
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:34,880
The code word is 'Rochambeau,' dig me?
(Rochambeau!)

1073
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,540
You have your orders now, go, man, go!

1074
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:40,780
And so the American experiment begins
With my friends all scattered to the winds

1075
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:44,040
Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining brav'ry

1076
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:47,040
HAMILTON/LAURENS:
We'll never be free until we end slavery!

1077
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,460
HAMILTON:
When we finally drive the British away

1078
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:50,100
Lafayette is there waiting--

1079
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,480
HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE:
In Chesapeake Bay!

1080
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,340
HAMILTON:
How did we know that this plan would work?

1081
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:56,940
We had a spy on the inside. That's right,
Hercules Mulligan!

1082
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,740
MULLIGAN:
A tailor spyin' on the British government!

1083
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:01,740
I take their measurements,
information and then I smuggle it (Up!)

1084
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:06,360
To my brother's revolutionary covenant I'm
runnin' with the Sons of Liberty and I am lovin' it!

1085
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,840
See, that's what happens when
you up against the ruffians

1086
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:11,000
We in the shit now,
somebody gotta shovel it!

1087
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,260
Hercules Mulligan,
I need no introduction

1088
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:16,260
When you knock me down
I get the fuck back up again!

1089
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:49,880
HAMILTON:
After a week of fighting, a young man
in a red coat stands on a parapet.

1090
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:54,580
LAFAYETTE:
We lower our guns as he frantically
waves a white handkerchief.

1091
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:59,480
MULLIGAN:
And just like that, it's over.
We tend to our wounded, we count our dead.

1092
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:03,600
LAURENS:
Black and white soldiers wonder alike
if this really means freedom

1093
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,880
WASHINGTON:
Not. Yet.

1094
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:07,880
HAMILTON:
We negotiate the terms of surrender

1095
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:10,100
I see George Washington smile

1096
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:15,040
We escort their men out of Yorktown
They stagger home single file

1097
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:19,880
Tens of thousands of people flood the streets
There are screams and church bells ringing

1098
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:24,860
And as our fallen foes retreat
I hear the drinking song they're singing...

1099
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:28,800
The world turned upside down

1100
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:33,720
The world turned upside down

1101
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:37,960
The world turned upside down

1102
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:46,780
The world turned upside down
Down down, down, down

1103
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:47,520
LAFAYETTE:
Freedom for America, freedom for France!
The world turned upside down
Down down, down, down

1104
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,780
LAFAYETTE:
Freedom for America, freedom for France!

1105
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:51,660
Down, down, down

1106
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:52,780
HAMILTON:
Gotta start a new nation! Gotta meet my son!
Down, down, down

1107
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:54,180
HAMILTON:
Gotta start a new nation! Gotta meet my son!

1108
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:54,240
Down, down, down
HAMILTON:
Gotta start a new nation! Gotta meet my son!

1109
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,280
Down, down, down

1110
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,020
MULLIGAN: We won!
LAFAYETTE: We won!
Down, down, down

1111
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:57,400
MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS:
We won!
MULLIGAN: We won!
LAFAYETTE: We won!
Down, down, down

1112
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:57,680
Down, down, down
MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS:
We won!

1113
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:57,860
MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS:
We won!

1114
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:58,100
MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS/HAMILTON/WASHINGTON:
We won!
MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS:
We won!

1115
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:59,080
MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS/HAMILTON/WASHINGTON:
We won!

1116
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:05,840
The world turned upside down!

1117
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:10,420
KING GEORGE:
They say,

1118
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:16,220
The price of my war is not a price
that they are willing to pay

1119
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:21,140
Insane
You cheat with the French

1120
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:24,580
Now I am fighting with France and with Spain

1121
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:27,060
I am so blue

1122
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:32,640
I thought that we'd made an arrangement
when you went away

1123
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:39,620
You were mine to subdue
Well even despite our estrangement

1124
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:46,060
I got a small query for you

1125
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:50,980
What comes next?
You've been freed

1126
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:54,780
Do you know how hard it is to lead?

1127
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:59,200
You're on your own
Awesome. Wow.

1128
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:03,060
Do you have a clue what happens now?

1129
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:11,260
Oceans rise, empires fall
It's much harder when it's all your call

1130
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:15,620
All alone, across the sea

1131
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:24,600
When your people say they hate you,
don't come crawling back to me.

1132
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:43,300
You're on your own...

1133
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:00,680
BURR:
Dear Theodosia what to say to you

1134
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:04,860
You have my eyes
You have your mother's name

1135
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:10,960
When you came into the world
you cried and it broke my heart

1136
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:23,280
I'm dedicating everyday to you
Domestic life was never quite my style

1137
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:31,880
When you smile, you knock me out
I fall apart and I thought I was so smart

1138
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:35,420
You will come of age with our young nation

1139
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:40,640
We'll bleed and fight for you
We'll make it right for you

1140
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:44,820
If we lay a strong enough foundation

1141
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:48,840
We'll pass it on to you
We'll give the world to you

1142
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:55,360
And you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

1143
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:04,880
Yeah you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

1144
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:15,780
HAMILTON:
Oh, Phillip when you smile I am undone, my son

1145
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:21,900
Look at my son
Pride is not the word I'm looking for

1146
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:26,420
There is so much more inside me now

1147
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:34,400
Oh, Phillip you outshine the
morning sun, my son

1148
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:43,360
When you smile, I fall apart
and I thought I was so smart

1149
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:47,440
My father wasn't around

1150
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,120
BURR:
My father wasn't around

1151
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:49,980
HAMILTON:
I swear that

1152
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:53,440
HAMILTON/BURR:
I'll be around for you

1153
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,440
HAMILTON:
I'll do whatever it takes

1154
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,420
BURR:
I'll make a million mistakes

1155
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:02,400
HAMILTON/BURR:
I'll make the world safe and sound for you

1156
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:07,480
You'll come of age with our young nation

1157
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:12,480
We'll bleed and fight for you
We'll make it right for you

1158
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,460
If we lay a strong enough foundation

1159
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:16,480
We'll pass it on to you
We'll give the world to you
If we lay a strong enough foundation

1160
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:21,060
We'll pass it on to you
We'll give the world to you

1161
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:27,420
And you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

1162
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:37,440
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

1163
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:45,860
LAURENS:
I may not live to see our glory.

1164
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:48,600
ELIZA:
Alexander? There's a letter for you.

1165
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:50,540
HAMILTON:
It's from John Laurens. I'll read it later.

1166
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:53,540
LAURENS:
But I will gladly join the fight.

1167
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:55,500
ELIZA:
No. It's from his father.

1168
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,880
HAMILTON:
His father?

1169
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,460
LAURENS:
And when our children tell our story.

1170
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:02,460
HAMILTON:
Will you read it for me?

1171
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:08,060
LAURENS:
They'll tell the story of tonight.

1172
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:11,060
ELIZA:
"On Tuesday the 27th,

1173
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:17,460
"my son was killed in a gunfight against
British troops retreating from South Carolina.

1174
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:25,140
"The war was already over. As you know,
John dreamed of emancipating and recruiting

1175
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:34,560
"3000 men for the first all-black military regiment.
His dream of freedom for these men dies with him."

1176
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:40,700
LAURENS:
Tomorrow there'll be more of us...

1177
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:45,460
ELIZA:
Alexander. Are you alright?

1178
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:48,500
HAMILTON:
I have so much work to do.

1179
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:51,480
BURR:
After the war I went back to New York

1180
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,280
HAMILTON:
A-After the war I went back to New York

1181
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:57,020
BURR:
I finished up my studies and I practiced law

1182
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:59,320
HAMILTON:
I practiced law, Burr worked next door

1183
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:02,320
BURR:
Even though we started at the very same time

1184
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,700
Alexander Hamilton began to climb

1185
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:10,580
How to account for his rise to the top?
Maaaaan, the man is non-stop!

1186
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:13,220
HAMILTON:
Gentlemen of the jury, I'm curious, bear with me

1187
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:15,260
Are you aware that we're making hist'ry?

1188
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:18,260
This is the first murder trial
of our brand-new nation

1189
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:20,720
The liberty behind deliberation--
(Non-stop!)

1190
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,660
I intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
With my assistant counsel

1191
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:25,340
BURR:
Co-counsel. Hamilton, sit down,

1192
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:28,240
Our client Levi Weeks is innocent.
Call your first witness

1193
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,240
That's all you had to say!

1194
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,880
HAMILTON:
Okay! One more thing--

1195
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,380
BURR:
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?

1196
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:38,580
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?

1197
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:41,580
Soon that attitude may be your doom!

1198
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:43,940
Why do you write like you're
running out of time?

1199
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:46,560
Write day and night like you're
running out of time?

1200
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:49,080
Ev'ry day you fight, like you're
running out of time

1201
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:52,060
Keep on fighting. In the meantime--
(Non-stop!)

1202
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:55,000
HAMILTON:
Corruption's such an old song that
we can sing along in harmony

1203
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,520
And nowhere is it stronger than in Albany
This colony's economy's increasingly stalling

1204
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,600
And honestly, that's why public service (He's just)
Seems to be calling me. (Non-stop!)

1205
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,980
I practiced the law,
I practic'ly perfected it

1206
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:07,460
I've seen injustice in the world
and I've corrected it

1207
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:10,600
Now for a strong central democracy
If not, then I'll be Socrates

1208
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,660
Throwing verbal rocks
At these mediocrities.

1209
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:15,300
BURR:
Hamilton, at the Constitutional Convention:

1210
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:17,900
HAMILTON:
I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention

1211
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:20,500
BURR:
There as a New York junior delegate:

1212
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:23,180
HAMILTON:
Now what I'm going to say may sound indelicate...

1213
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:25,720
BURR:
Goes and proposes his own form of government!

1214
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:28,080
(What?)
His own plan for a new form of government!

1215
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:30,920
(What?)
Talks for six hours! The convention is listless!

1216
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,640
Bright young man...
Yo, who the f is this?

1217
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:38,460
Why do you always say what you believe?
Why do you always say what you believe?

1218
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:43,980
Ev'ry proclamation guarantees
free ammunition for your enemies!

1219
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:46,600
Why do you write like it's
going out of style?

1220
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,880
Write day and night like it's
going out of style?

1221
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,880
Ev'ry day you fight like it's
Going out of style

1222
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,140
Do what you do

1223
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,460
BURR: Alexander?
HAMILTON: Aaron Burr, sir

1224
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:57,820
BURR:
It's the middle of the night

1225
01:07:57,820 --> 01:07:59,020
HAMILTON:
Can we confer, sir?

1226
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:00,200
BURR:
Is this a legal matter?

1227
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,780
HAMILTON:
Yes, and it's important to me

1228
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:02,580
BURR:
What do you need?

1229
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:04,360
HAMILTON:
Burr, you're a better lawyer than me

1230
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:05,080
BURR:
Okay

1231
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:07,080
HAMILTON:
I know I talk too much, I'm abrasive

1232
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,820
You're incredible in court,
You're succinct, persuasive.

1233
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:12,420
My client needs a strong defense.
You're the solution.

1234
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:13,200
BURR:
Who's your client?

1235
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,200
HAMILTON:
The new U.S. Constitution

1236
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:15,620
BURR:
No

1237
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:16,140
HAMILTON:
Hear me out

1238
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:17,020
BURR:
No way!

1239
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:19,680
HAMILTON:
A series of essays, anonymously published

1240
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:21,660
Defending the document to the public

1241
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:23,280
BURR: No one will read it
HAMILTON: I disagree

1242
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:25,220
BURR:And if it fails?
HAMILTON: Burr, that's why we need it

1243
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:28,000
BURR: The constitution's a mess
HAMILTON: So it needs amendments

1244
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,640
BURR: It's full of contradictions
HAMILTON: So is independence

1245
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,080
We have to start somewhere

1246
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,480
BURR: No. No way
HAMILTON: You're making a mistake

1247
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:35,820
BURR: Good night
HAMILTON: Hey

1248
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:38,720
What are you waiting for?
What do you stall for?

1249
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:39,980
BURR: What?
HAMILTON: We won the war

1250
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:43,020
What was it all for?
Do you support this constitution?

1251
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:44,400
BURR: Of course
HAMILTON: Then defend it

1252
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,340
BURR:
And what if you're backing the wrong horse?

1253
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:49,000
HAMILTON:
Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed

1254
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,640
For the notion of a nation
we now get to build

1255
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:54,280
For once in your life,
take a stand with pride

1256
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:56,600
I don't understand how
you stand to the side

1257
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:00,560
BURR:
I'll keep all my plans close to my chest

1258
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:04,080
(Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it)
I'll wait here and see

1259
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,820
Which way the wind will blow

1260
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:14,240
I'm taking my time watching the afterbirth
of a nation watching the tension grow.

1261
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:19,860
ANGELICA:
I am sailing off to London.

1262
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:23,440
I'm accompanied by someone who always pays

1263
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:28,640
I have found a wealthy husband who will
keep me in comfort for all my days

1264
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:34,080
He is not a lot of fun, but there's no one
who can match you for turn of phrase

1265
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,340
My Alexander

1266
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:37,460
HAMILTON:
Angelica

1267
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:40,160
ANGELICA:
Don't forget to write

1268
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,600
ELIZA:
Look at where you are

1269
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:47,500
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle

1270
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:50,500
Just stay alive, that would be enough

1271
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:55,760
And if your wife could share
a fraction of your time

1272
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:00,140
If I could grant you peace of mind
Would that be enough?

1273
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:05,280
BURR:
Alexander joins forces with James Madison
and John Jay to write a series of essays

1274
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:09,700
Defending the new United States Constitution,
entitled The Federalist Papers.

1275
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:15,180
The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays,
the work divided evenly among the three men.

1276
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:20,700
In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays,
in the span of six months.

1277
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:26,560
John Jay got sick after writing five.
James Madison wrote twenty-nine.

1278
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:30,240
Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one!

1279
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:34,200
How do you write like you're
Running out of time?

1280
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:37,200
Write day and night like you're
Running out of time?

1281
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,540
Ev'ry day you fight like you're
Running out of time

1282
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:42,540
Like you're running out of time
Are you running out of time?

1283
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:47,560
How do you write like tomorrow won't arrive?
How do you write like you need it to survive?

1284
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:52,900
How do you write ev'ry second you're alive?
Ev'ry second you're alive? Ev'ry second you're alive?

1285
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:56,160
WASHINGTON:
They are asking me to lead

1286
01:10:56,160 --> 01:11:01,180
I am doing the best I can
To get the people that I need

1287
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:04,600
I'm asking you to be my right hand man
HAMILTON: Treasury or State?

1288
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:07,120
WASHINGTON: I know it's a lot to ask
HAMILTON: Treasury or State?

1289
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,800
WASHINGTON:
To leave behind the world you know...

1290
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:11,800
HAMILTON:
Sir, do you want me to run the
Treasury or State department?

1291
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:13,860
WASHINGTON:
Treasury

1292
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:15,420
HAMILTON:
Let's go

1293
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:18,420
ELIZA:
Alexander...

1294
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:19,780
HAMILTON:
I have to leave

1295
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:21,020
ELIZA:
Alexander--

1296
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:26,300
HAMILTON:
Look around, look around at how
lucky we are to be alive right now

1297
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:27,260
ELIZA:
Helpless...

1298
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:27,560
HAMILTON:
They are asking me to lead
ELIZA:
Helpless...

1299
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,280
HAMILTON:
They are asking me to lead

1300
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,620
ELIZA:
Look around, isn't this enough?

1301
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:34,380
ANGELICA: He will never be satisfied
ELIZA: What would be enough

1302
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:36,580
ANGELICA:
He will never be satisfied

1303
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:43,060
Satisfied, satisfied
WASHINGTON: History has its eyes on you!

1304
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:58,040
History has its eyes on you!

1305
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:00,040
HAMILTON:
I am not throwin' away my shot!
(Just you wait!)

1306
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:02,640
I am not throwin' away my shot!
(Just you wait!)

1307
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,060
I am Alexander Hamilton!
(Alexander Hamilton! Hamilton!)

1308
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:09,840
(Just you wait!)
I am not throwin' away my shot!

1309
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,940
ACT II

1310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, I’ve got to be in
The room where it happens…

1311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I’ve got to be, I’ve gotta be,
I’ve gotta be…

1312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In the room!

1313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

1314
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,640
AARON BURR:
1789!

1315
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:27,640
How does the bastard orphan
Immigrant decorated war vet

1316
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:31,640
Unite the colonies through more debt?
Fight the other founding fathers til he has to forfeit?

1317
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:34,640
Have it all, lose it all
You ready for more yet?

1318
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:39,640
Treasury Secretary. Washington’s the President
Ev’ry American experiment sets a precedent

1319
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:45,640
Not so fast. Someone came along to resist him
Pissed him off until we had a two-party system

1320
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:51,640
You haven’t met him yet, you haven’t had the chance
‘cause he’s been kickin’ ass as the ambassador to France

1321
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:56,640
But someone’s gotta keep the American promise
You simply must meet Thomas. Thomas!

1322
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:28,640
JEFFERSON:
France is following us to revolution

1323
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:34,640
There is no more status quo
But the sun comes up and the world still spins

1324
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:40,640
I helped Lafayette draft a declaration
Then I said, ‘I gotta go

1325
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:46,640
I gotta be in Monticello.’ Now the work at
Home begins…

1326
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:56,640
So what’d I miss?
What’d I miss?

1327
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,640
Virginia, my home sweet home,
I wanna give you a kiss

1328
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:06,640
I’ve been in Paris meeting lots of different ladies...
I guess I basic’lly missed the late eighties...

1329
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:10,640
I traveled the wide, wide world and came back to this…

1330
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:17,640
There’s a letter on my desk from the President
Haven’t even put my bags down yet

1331
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:22,640
Sally be a lamb, darlin’, won’tcha open it?
It says the President’s assembling a cabinet

1332
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:27,640
And that I am to be the Secretary of State, great!
And that I’m already Senate-approved...

1333
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:31,640
I just got home and now I’m headed up to New York

1334
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:39,640
Lookin’ at the rolling fields
I can’t believe that we are free

1335
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:45,640
Ready to face
Whatever’s awaiting me in NYC

1336
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:50,640
But who’s waitin’ for me when I step in the place?
My friend James Madison, red in the face

1337
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:57,640
He grabs my arm and
I respond “What’s goin’ on?”

1338
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,640
MADISON:
Thomas, we are engaged in a battle

1339
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:06,640
For our nation’s very soul
Can you get us out of the mess we’re in?

1340
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:12,640
Hamilton’s new financial plan is nothing less
Than government control

1341
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:16,640
I’ve been fighting for the South alone
Where have you been?

1342
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:19,640
JEFFERSON:
Uh...France.

1343
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,640
MADISON:
We have to win

1344
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:26,640
JEFFERSON:
What’d I miss?

1345
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:30,640
Headfirst into a political abyss!

1346
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:38,640
I have my first cabinet meeting today
I guess I better think of something to say

1347
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:41,640
I’m already on my way
Let’s get to the bottom of this…

1348
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:48,640
WASHINGTON:
Mr. Jefferson, welcome home

1349
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,640
HAMILTON:
Mr. Jefferson? Alexander Hamilton

1350
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:56,640
WASHINGTON AND ENSEMBLE:
Mr. Jefferson, welcome home

1351
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:06,640
Mr. Jefferson, welcome home
Sir, you’ve been off in Paris for so long!

1352
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:07,750
JEFFERSON:
So what did I miss?

1353
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:08,640
WASHINGTON:
Ladies and gentlemen
JEFFERSON:
So what did I miss?

1354
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:09,750
WASHINGTON:
Ladies and gentlemen

1355
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:14,750
You coulda been anywhere in the world tonight,
but you’re here with us in New York City.

1356
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:18,750
Are you ready for a cabinet meeting?

1357
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:27,750
The issue on the table:
Secretary Hamilton’s plan to assume state debt and establish a national bank.

1358
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:30,750
Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir

1359
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:33,750
JEFFERSON:
‘Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.’

1360
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:38,750
We fought for these ideals; we shouldn’t settle for less
These are wise words, enterprising men quote ‘em

1361
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:42,750
Don’t act surprised, you guys, cuz I wrote ‘em

1362
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:47,750
But Hamilton forgets
His plan would have the government assume state’s debts

1363
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:52,750
Now, place your bets as to who that benefits:
The very seat of government where Hamilton sits

1364
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:53,750
HAMILTON:
Not true!

1365
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:55,750
JEFFERSON:
Ooh, if the shoe fits, wear it

1366
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:58,750
If New York’s in debt—
Why should Virginia bear it? Uh!

1367
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:03,750
Our debts are paid, I’m afraid
Don’t tax the South cuz we got it made in the shade

1368
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:08,750
In Virginia, we plant seeds in the ground
We create. You just wanna move our money around

1369
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:15,750
This financial plan is an outrageous demand
And it’s too many damn pages for any man to understand

1370
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:20,750
Stand with me in the land of the free
And pray to God we never see Hamilton’s candidacy

1371
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:26,750
Look, when Britain taxed our tea, we got frisky
Imagine what gon’ happen when you try to tax our whisky

1372
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:29,750
WASHINGTON:
Thank you, Secretary Jefferson.

1373
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:32,740
Secretary Hamilton, your response

1374
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:33,750
HAMILTON:
Thomas. That was a real nice declaration
Secretary Hamilton, your response

1375
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:35,740
HAMILTON:
Thomas. That was a real nice declaration

1376
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:40,740
Welcome to the present, we’re running a real nation
Would you like to join us, or stay mellow

1377
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:45,740
Doin’ whatever the hell it is you do in Monticello?
If we assume the debts, the union gets

1378
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:51,740
A new line of credit, a financial diuretic
How do you not get it? If we’re aggressive and competitive

1379
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:57,740
The union gets a boost. You’d rather give it a sedative?
A civics lesson from a slaver. Hey neighbor

1380
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:02,740
Your debts are paid cuz you don’t pay for labor
“We plant seeds in the South. We create.”

1381
01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:05,740
Yeah, keep ranting
We know who’s really doing the planting

1382
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:10,740
And another thing, Mr. Age of Enlightenment
Don’t lecture me about the war, you didn’t fight in it

1383
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:13,740
You think I’m frightened of you, man?
We almost died in a trench

1384
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:18,740
While you were off getting high with the French
Thomas Jefferson, always hesitant with the President

1385
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:24,740
Reticent—there isn’t a plan he doesn’t jettison
Madison, you’re mad as a hatter, son, take your medicine

1386
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:29,740
Damn, you’re in worse shape than the national debt is in
Sittin’ there useless as two shits

1387
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:33,740
Hey, turn around, bend over, I’ll show you
Where my shoe fits

1388
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:36,740
WASHINGTON:
Excuse me? Jefferson, Madison, take a walk!

1389
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:41,740
Hamilton, take a walk!
We’ll reconvene after a brief recess. Hamilton!

1390
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:42,740
HAMILTON:
Sir!

1391
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:44,740
WASHINGTON:
A word

1392
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:46,740
MADISON:
You don’t have the votes

1393
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:48,740
JEFFERSON/MADISON:
You don’t have the votes

1394
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:55,740
You’re gonna need congressional approval
and you don’t have the votes

1395
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:59,740
JEFFERSON:
Such a blunder sometimes it makes me wonder why I even bring the thunder

1396
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:05,340
WASHINGTON:
You wanna pull yourself together?

1397
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:07,880
HAMILTON:
I’m sorry, these Virginians are birds of a feather

1398
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:10,660
WASHINGTON:
Young man, I’m from Virginia, so watch your mouth

1399
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:13,660
HAMILTON:
So we let Congress get held hostage by the South?

1400
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:14,720
WASHINGTON:
You need the votes

1401
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:17,040
HAMILTON:
No, we need bold strokes. We need this plan

1402
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:18,840
WASHINGTON:
No, you need to convince more folks

1403
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:21,580
HAMILTON:
James Madison won’t talk to me, that’s a nonstarter

1404
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:24,300
WASHINGTON:
Winning was easy, young man. Governing’s harder

1405
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:25,380
HAMILTON:
They’re being intransigent

1406
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:27,100
WASHINGTON:
You have to find a compromise

1407
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:28,820
HAMILTON:
But they don’t have a plan, they just hate mine!

1408
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:30,020
WASHINGTON:
Convince them otherwise

1409
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:32,420
HAMILTON:
What happens if I don’t get congressional approval?

1410
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:34,780
WASHINGTON:
I imagine they’ll call for your removal

1411
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:35,520
HAMILTON:
Sir—

1412
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:40,400
That’s an order from your commander
WASHINGTON:
Figure it out, Alexander.

My dearest, Angelica

1426
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:12,140
“Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day”

1427
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:18,060
I trust you’ll understand the reference to
Another Scottish tragedy without my having to name the play

1428
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:23,900
They think me Macbeth, and ambition is my folly
I’m a polymath, a pain in the ass, a massive pain

1429
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:30,500
Madison is Banquo, Jefferson’s Macduff
And Birnam Wood is Congress on its way to Dunsinane

1430
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:33,340
HAMILTON & ANGELICA:
And there you are, an ocean away

1431
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:37,980
Do you have to live an ocean away?
Thoughts of you subside

1432
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:42,200
Then I get another letter
I cannot put the notion away…

There’s a little surprise before supper

1436
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:48,920
And it cannot wait

1437
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:50,900
HAMILTON:
I’ll be there in just a minute, save my plate

1438
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:51,980
ELIZA:
Alexander

1439
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:52,180
HAMILTON:
Okay, okay
ELIZA:
Alexander

1440
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:52,840
HAMILTON:
Okay, okay

1441
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:55,840
ELIZA:
Your son is nine years old today

1442
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:01,020
Has something he’d like to say
He’s been practicing all day

1443
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:04,020
Philip, take it away

1444
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:05,480
PHILIP:
Daddy, daddy, look

1445
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:08,480
My name is Philip
I am a poet

1446
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:11,480
I wrote this poem just
To show it

1447
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:13,920
And I just turned nine

1448
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,620
You can write rhymes
But you can’t write mine

1449
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:19,620
I practice French
And play piano with my mother

1450
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:22,620
I have a sister, but I want a little brother

1451
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:27,320
My daddy’s trying to start America’s bank
Un deux trois quatre cinq!

1452
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:27,700
HAMILTON:
Bravo!
My daddy’s trying to start America’s bank
Un deux trois quatre cinq!

1453
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:28,100
HAMILTON:
Bravo!

1454
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:29,200
ELIZA:
Take a break

1455
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:30,900
HAMILTON:
Hey, our kid is pretty great

1456
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:34,760
ELIZA:
Run away with us for the summer
Let’s go upstate

1457
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:36,600
HAMILTON:
Eliza, I’ve got so much on my plate

1458
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,360
ELIZA:
We can all go stay with my father

1459
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,240
There’s a lake I know…

1460
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:41,580
HAMILTON:
I know
There’s a lake I know…

1461
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:42,280
HAMILTON:
I know

1462
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:43,820
ELIZA:
In a nearby park

1463
01:21:43,820 --> 01:21:45,240
HAMILTON:
I’d love to go

1464
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:50,220
ELIZA:
You and I can go when the night gets dark…

1465
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:51,400
HAMILTON:
I will try to get away

1466
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:53,360
ANGELICA:
My dearest Alexander

1467
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:56,540
You must get through to Jefferson
Sit down with him and compromise

1468
01:21:56,540 --> 01:21:59,540
Don’t stop ‘til you agree
Your fav’rite older sister

1469
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:04,060
Angelica, reminds you
There’s someone in your corner all the way across the sea

1470
01:22:04,060 --> 01:22:09,680
In a letter I received from you two weeks ago
I noticed a comma in the middle of a phrase

1471
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:15,280
It changed the meaning. Did you intend this?
One stroke and you’ve consumed my waking days

1472
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:15,820
It says:

1473
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:18,820
HAMILTON & ANGELICA:
“My dearest Angelica”

1474
01:22:18,820 --> 01:22:21,960
ANGELICA:
With a comma after “dearest.” You’ve written

1475
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:26,760
HAMILTON AND ANGELICA:
“My dearest, Angelica.”

1476
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:29,020
ANGELICA:
Anyway, all this to say

1477
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:31,840
I’m coming home this summer
At my sister’s invitation

1478
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,840
I’ll be there with your fam’ly
If you make your way upstate

1479
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,840
I know you’re very busy
I know your work’s important

1480
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:40,840
But I’m crossing the ocean and I just can’t wait

1481
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:43,280
HAMILTON AND ANGELICA:
You won’t be an ocean away

1482
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:46,280
You will only be a moment away…

1483
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:49,280
ELIZA:
Alexander, come downstairs.

1484
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:52,280
Angelica’s arriving today!

1485
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:56,340
Angelica!

1486
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:58,300
ANGELICA:
Eliza!

1487
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:01,580
HAMILTON:
The Schuyler sisters!

1488
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:04,320
ANGELICA:
Alexander

1489
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:04,840
HAMILTON:
Hi

1490
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:07,460
ANGELICA:
It’s good to see your face

1491
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:09,480
ELIZA:
Angelica, tell this man ...

1492
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:13,420
John Adams spends the summer with his family

1493
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:15,340
HAMILTON:
Angelica, tell my wife ...

1494
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:19,360
John Adams doesn’t have a real job anyway

1495
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:22,000
ANGELICA:
…you’re not joining us? Wait

1496
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
HAMILTON:
I’m afraid I cannot join you upstate

1497
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,320
ANGELICA:
Alexander, I came all this way

1498
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:29,340
ELIZA:
She came all this way

1499
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:30,240
ANGELICA:
All this way

1500
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:31,140
ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
Take a break

1501
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:33,200
HAMILTON:
You know I have to get my plan through Congress

1502
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:35,160
ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
Run away with us for the summer

1503
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:36,500
Let’s go upstate

1504
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:38,860
HAMILTON:
I lose my job if I don’t get my plan through Congress

1505
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:41,300
ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
We can all go stay with our father

1506
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:42,720
ELIZA:
There’s a lake I know

1507
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,560
ANGELICA:
I know I’ll miss your face
ELIZA:
There’s a lake I know

1508
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:44,620
ANGELICA:
I know I’ll miss your face

1509
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:45,340
ELIZA:
In a nearby park

1510
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:46,520
ANGELICA:
Screw your courage to the sticking place
ELIZA:
In a nearby park

1511
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:47,140
ANGELICA:
Screw your courage to the sticking place

1512
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:47,920
ELIZA:
You and I can go
ANGELICA:
Screw your courage to the sticking place

1513
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:48,700
ELIZA:
You and I can go

1514
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:49,340
ANGELICA:
Eliza’s right
ELIZA:
You and I can go

1515
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:49,860
ANGELICA:
Eliza’s right

1516
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:52,840
ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
Take a break and get away

1517
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:52,860
ANGELICA:
Run away with us for the summer
ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
Take a break and get away

1518

Run away with us for the summer

1519

ELIZA:
Let’s go upstate
Where we can stay

1520
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:03,580
ANGELICA:
We can all go stay with our father
If you take your time

1521
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:04,340
ELIZA:
Look around, look around
At how lucky we are to be alive right now

1522
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:07,340
ANGELICA:
You will make your mark
Close your eyes and dream
ELIZA:
Look around, look around
At how lucky we are to be alive right now

1523
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:08,600
ANGELICA:
You will make your mark
Close your eyes and dream

1524
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:09,380

We can go
ANGELICA:
You will make your mark
Close your eyes and dream

1525
01:24:09,380 --> 01:24:09,460
ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
When the night gets dark
Take a break.
ANGELICA:
You will make your mark
Close your eyes and dream

1526
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:13,460
ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
When the night gets dark
Take a break.

1527
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:15,640
HAMILTON:
I have to get my plan through Congress

1528
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:18,780
I can’t stop until I get this plan through Congress

1529
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:37,060
BURR:
There’s nothing like summer in the city

1530
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:42,980
Someone under stress meets someone looking pretty

1531
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:53,120
There’s trouble in the air, you can smell it
And Alexander’s by himself. I’ll let him tell it

1532
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,920
HAMILTON:
I hadn’t slept in a week

1533
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:59,040
I was weak, I was awake
You never seen a bastard orphan

1534
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:02,040
More in need of a break
Longing for Angelica

1535
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:06,880
Missing my wife
That’s when Miss Maria Reynolds walked into my life, she said:

1536
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:09,880
MARIA:
I know you are a man of honor

1537
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:18,120
I’m so sorry to bother you at home
But I don’t know where to go, and I came here all alone…

1538
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:18,720
HAMILTON:
She said:

1539
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:21,300
MARIA:
My husband’s doin’ me wrong

1540
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:27,880
Beatin’ me, cheatin’ me, mistreatin’ me...
Suddenly he’s up and gone

1541
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:30,240
I don’t have the means to go on

1542
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:33,500
HAMILTON:
So I offered her a loan, I offered to walk her home, she said

1543
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:35,960
MARIA:
You’re too kind, sir

1544
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:38,120
HAMILTON:
I gave her thirty bucks that I had socked away

1545
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:39,900
She lived a block away, she said:

1546
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:41,980
MARIA:
This one’s mine, sir

1547
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:43,760
HAMILTON:
Then I said, “well, I should head back home,”

1548
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:48,080
She turned red, she led me to her bed
Let her legs spread and said:

1549
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,440
MARIA:
Stay?

1550
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,760
HAMILTON:
Hey…

1551
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:52,220
MARIA:
Hey…

1552
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:53,920
HAMILTON:
That’s when I began to pray:

1553
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:56,920
Lord, show me how to
Say no to this

1554
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:59,920
I don’t know how to
Say no to this

1555
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:05,380
But my God, she looks so helpless
And her body’s saying, “hell, yes”

1556
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:05,700
MARIA:
Whoa...

1557
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:07,060
HAMILTON:
Nooo, show me how to
MARIA:
Whoa...

1558
01:26:07,060 --> 01:26:07,080
MARIA:
Whoa...

1559
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,580
Say no to this
I don’t know how to
MARIA:
Whoa...

1560
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:09,980
Say no to this
I don’t know how to

1561
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:13,440
Say no to this
In my mind, I’m tryin’ to go

1562
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:17,340
Then her mouth is on mine, and I don’t say…

1563
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:23,560
No! No!
Say no to this!

1564
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:35,780
I wish I could say that was the last time
I said that last time. It became a pastime

1565
01:26:35,780 --> 01:26:41,400
A month into this endeavor I received a letter
From a Mr. James Reynolds, even better, it said:

1566
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:44,400
JAMES:
Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health

1567
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:50,140
And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
In the pockets of people like me: down on their luck

1568
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:52,700
You see, that was my wife who you decided to

1569
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:53,500
HAMILTON:
Fuuuu

1570
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:54,660
JAMES:
Uh-oh! You made the wrong sucker a cuckold
HAMILTON:
Fuuuu

1571
01:26:54,660 --> 01:26:56,200
JAMES:
Uh-oh! You made the wrong sucker a cuckold

1572
01:26:56,200 --> 01:27:01,640
So time to pay the piper for the pants you unbuckled
And hey, you can keep seein’ my whore wife

1573
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:04,640
If the price is right: if not I’m telling your wife

1574
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:07,160
HAMILTON:
I hid the letter and I raced to her place

1575
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:09,500
Screamed “How could you?!” in her face
She said:

1576
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:10,840
MARIA:
No, sir!

1577
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:11,180
HAMILTON:
Half dressed, apologetic.
MARIA:
No, sir!

1578
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:12,400
HAMILTON:
Half dressed, apologetic.

1579
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,560
A mess, she looked
Pathetic, she cried:

1580
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,800
MARIA:
Please don’t go, sir!

1581
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,160
HAMILTON:
So was your whole story a setup?

1582
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:19,900
MARIA:
I don’t know about any letter!

1583
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:21,460
HAMILTON:
Stop crying Goddamnit, get up!

1584
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:22,760
MARIA:
I didn’t know any better

1585
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:23,620
HAMILTON:
I am ruined...

1586
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:24,060
MARIA:
Please don’t leave me with him helpless

1587
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:26,020
HAMILTON:
I am helpless—how could I do this?
MARIA:
Please don’t leave me with him helpless

1588
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:26,760
HAMILTON:
I am helpless—how could I do this?

1589
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:28,780
MARIA:
Just give him what he wants and you can have me

1590
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:29,560
HAMILTON:
I don’t want you
MARIA:
Just give him what he wants and you can have me

1591
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:29,620
HAMILTON:
I don’t want you

1592
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:30,760
MARIA:
Whatever you want

1593
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:35,220
MARIA:
If you pay
You can stay

1594
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,600
HAMILTON
Lord, show me how to say no to this

1595
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:40,600
I don’t know how to
Say no to this

1596
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:46,080
Cuz the situation’s helpless
And her body’s screaming, “Hell, yes”

1597
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:49,080
No, show me how to
Say no to this

1598
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:52,080
How can I
Say no to this?

1599
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:55,080
There is nowhere I can go

1600
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:58,080
When her body’s on mine
I do not say…

1601
01:27:58,300 --> 01:27:59,100
ENSEMBLE:
No!

1602
01:27:59,120 --> 01:27:59,760
HAMILTON
Yes!

1603
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:02,160
ENSEMBLE:
No!

1604
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:02,660
HAMILTON
Yes!

1605
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:05,020
ENSEMBLE:
No!

1606
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:05,820
HAMILTON
Yes!

1607
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:08,020
ENSEMBLE:
No!

1608
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:08,820
HAMILTON
Yes!

1609
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:13,060
HAMILTON:
Say no to this…

1610
01:28:13,060 --> 01:28:18,280
I don’t say no to this
There is nowhere I can go.

1611
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:20,160
JAMES:
So?

1612
01:28:22,780 --> 01:28:25,540
HAMILTON:
Nobody needs to know

1613
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:37,060
BURR:
Ah, Mister Secretary

1614
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:38,260
HAMILTON:
Mister Burr, sir

1615
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:41,260
BURR:
Didja hear the news about good old General Mercer?

1616
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:41,740
HAMILTON:
No

1617
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:43,100
BURR:
You know Clermont Street?

1618
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:43,500
HAMILTON:
Yeah

1619
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:46,500
BURR:
They renamed it after him. The Mercer legacy is secure

1620
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:47,200
HAMILTON:
Sure

1621
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:49,360
BURR:
And all he had to do was die

1622
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:50,660
HAMILTON:
That’s a lot less work

1623
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:51,940
BURR:
We oughta give it a try

1624
01:28:51,940 --> 01:28:54,940
Now how’re you gonna get your debt plan through?

1625
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:57,560
HAMILTON:
I guess I’m gonna fin’ly have to listen to you

1626
01:28:57,560 --> 01:28:58,120
BURR:
Really?

1627
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:03,400
HAMILTON:
“Talk less. Smile more.”

1628
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:09,020
Do whatever it takes to get my plan on the Congress floor

1629
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:12,020
BURR:
Now, Madison and Jefferson are merciless.

1630
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:14,520
HAMILTON:
Well, hate the sin, love the sinner

1631
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:15,060
MADISON:
Hamilton!

1632
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:17,020
HAMILTON:
I’m sorry Burr, I’ve gotta go

1633
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:17,720
BURR:
But—

1634
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:20,100
HAMILTON:
Decisions are happening over dinner

1635
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:25,940
BURR:
Two Virginians and an immigrant walk into a room

1636
01:29:25,940 --> 01:29:30,420
Diametric’ly opposed, foes
They emerge with a compromise

1637
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:33,660
Having opened doors that were
Previously closed (Bros!)

1638
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:39,620
The immigrant emerges with unprecedented financial power
A system he can shape however he wants

1639
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:44,740
The Virginians emerge with the nation’s capital
And here’s the pièce de résistance:

1640
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:47,660
No one else was in
The room where it happened

1641
01:29:47,660 --> 01:29:50,660
The room where it happened
The room where it happened

1642
01:29:50,660 --> 01:29:53,080
No one else was in
The room where it happened

1643
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:56,080
The room where it happened
The room where it happened

1644
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:59,640
No one really knows how the game is played
The art of the trade

1645
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:03,780
How the sausage gets made
We just assume that it happens

1646
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:07,120
But no one else is in
The room where it happens.

1647
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:10,840
Thomas claims

1648
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:13,760
JEFFERSON:
Alexander was on Washington’s doorstep one day

1649
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:15,560
In distress ‘n disarray

1650
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:16,380
BURR AND COMPANY:
Thomas claims

1651
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:17,380
JEFFERSON:
Alexander said

1652
01:30:17,380 --> 01:30:18,320
HAMILTON:
I’ve nowhere else to turn!

1653
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,820
JEFFERSON:
And basic’ly begged me to join the fray

1654
01:30:20,820 --> 01:30:21,880
BURR AND COMPANY:
Thomas claims

1655
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:23,620
JEFFERSON:
I approached Madison and said

1656
01:30:23,620 --> 01:30:26,300
“I know you hate ‘im, but let’s hear what he has to say.”

1657
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:27,480
BURR AND COMPANY:
Thomas claims

1658
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:28,920
JEFFERSON:
Well, I arranged the meeting

1659
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:31,640
I arranged the menu, the venue, the seating

1660
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:34,640
BURR:
But! No one else was in
The room where it happened

1661
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:37,640
The room where it happened
The room where it happened

1662
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:40,120
No one else was in
The room where it happened

1663
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:42,760
The room where it happened
The room where it happened

1664
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:45,760
No one really knows how the
Parties get to yesssss

1665
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:48,760
The pieces that are sacrificed in
Ev’ry game of chesssss

1666
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:51,760
We just assume that it happens

1667
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:54,760
But no one else is in
The room where it happens.

1668
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:59,060
Meanwhile
Madison is grappling with the fact

1669
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:02,060
that not ev’ry issue can be settled by committee

1670
01:31:02,060 --> 01:31:05,600
Meanwhile
Congress is fighting over where to put the capital—

1671
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:10,280
It isn’t pretty
Then Jefferson approaches with a dinner and invite

1672
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:13,280
And Madison responds with Virginian insight:

1673
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,760
MADISON:
Maybe we can solve one problem with another

1674
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:18,420
and win a victory for the Southerners, in other words

1675
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:19,440
JEFFERSON:
Oh-ho!

1676
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:20,400
MADISON:
A quid pro quo

1677
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,300
JEFFERSON:
I suppose

1678
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:23,780
MADISON:
Wouldn’t you like to work a little closer to home?

1679
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:25,140
JEFFERSON:
Actually, I would

1680
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:26,520
MADISON:
Well, I propose the Potomac

1681
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:28,140
JEFFERSON:
And you’ll provide him his votes?

1682
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:29,220
MADISON:
Well, we’ll see how it goes

1683
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:29,720
JEFFERSON:
Let’s go

1684
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:30,340
BURR:
No!

1685
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:32,580
-one else was in
The room where it happened

1686
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:35,580
The room where it happened
The room where it happened

1687
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:37,900
No one else was in
The room where it happened

1688
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:40,900
The room where it happened
The room where it happened

1689
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:43,100
My God!
In God we trust

1690
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:48,680
But we’ll never really know what got discussed
Click-boom then it happened

1691
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:51,800
And no one else was in the room where it happened

1692
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:53,220
Alexander Hamilton!

1693
01:31:53,220 --> 01:31:57,380
What did they say to you to get you
to sell New York City down the river?

1694
01:31:57,380 --> 01:31:58,600
Alexander Hamilton!

1695
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:02,880
Did Washington know about the dinner?
Was there Presidential pressure to deliver?

1696
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,420
Alexander Hamilton!

1697
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:08,140
Or did you know, even then, it doesn’t matter
Where you put the U.S. Capital?

1698
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:11,140
HAMILTON:
Cuz we’ll have the banks, we’re in the same spot

1699
01:32:11,140 --> 01:32:12,320
BURR:
You got more than you gave

1700
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:13,680
HAMILTON:
And I wanted what I got

1701
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:19,240
When you got skin in the game, you stay in the game
But you don’t get a win unless you play in the game

1702
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:23,500
Oh, you get love for it. You get hate for it
You get nothing if you…

1703
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:25,160
Wait for it, wait for it, wait!

1704
01:32:26,180 --> 01:32:28,480
God help and forgive me
I wanna build

1705
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:30,560
Something that’s gonna
Outlive me

1706
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:33,340
What do you want, Burr?
What do you want, Burr?

1707
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:36,340
If you stand for nothing
Burr, then what do you fall for?

1708
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:39,040
I - I wanna be in

1709
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:42,040
The room where it happens
The room where it happens

1710
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:46,380
I wanna be in
The room where it happens

1711
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:48,960
The room where it happens

1712
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:51,960
I - I wanna be in

1713
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:54,060
The room where it happens

1714
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:56,280
I - I wanna be in

1715
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:59,280
The room - oh!

1716
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:07,100
I wanna be, I wanna be,
I've gotta be, I've gotta be

1717
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:10,560
In that room
That big ol' room

1718
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:13,060
The art of the compromise—

1719
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:16,060
Hold your nose and close your eyes

1720
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:18,700
We want our leaders to save the day—

1721
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:21,700
But we don’t get a say in what they trade away

1722
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:24,700
We dream of a brand new start—

1723
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:27,700
But we dream in the dark for the most part

1724
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:29,600
Dark as a tomb where it happens

1725
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:32,600
I’ve got to be in
The room…

1726
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:37,380
I’ve got to be...
I’ve got to be...

1727
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:49,380
Click-boom!

1728
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:54,460
PHILLIP:
Look!

1729
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:55,960
Grandpa’s in the paper!

1730
01:33:56,120 --> 01:34:01,400
“War hero Philip Schuyler loses senate seat
to young upstart Aaron Burr”

1731
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Grandpa just lost his seat in the senate

1732
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,260
ELIZA:
Sometimes that’s how it goes

1733
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:10,040
PHILLIP:
Daddy’s gonna find out any minute

1734
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:12,320
ELIZA:
I’m sure he already knows

1735
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:13,400
PHILLIP:
Further down

1736
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:14,240
PHILLIP & ELIZA:
Further down

1737
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:17,660
PHILLIP:
Let’s meet the newest senator from New York

1738
01:34:17,660 --> 01:34:18,940
ELIZA:
New York

1739
01:34:18,940 --> 01:34:20,900
PHILLIP & ELIZA:
Our senator

1740
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:21,600
HAMILTON:
Burr?

1741
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:23,960
Since when are you a Democratic-Republican?

1742
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:26,380
BURR:
Since being one put me on the up and up again

1743
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:28,380
HAMILTON:
No one knows who you are or what you do

1744
01:34:28,380 --> 01:34:29,720
BURR:
They don’t need to know me

1745
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:30,760
They don’t like you

1746
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:31,520
HAMILTON:
Excuse me?

1747
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:33,140
BURR:
Oh, Wall Street thinks you’re great

1748
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:36,140
You’ll always be adored by the things you create
But upstate—

1749
01:34:36,140 --> 01:34:36,720
HAMILTON:
Wait

1750
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:40,260
BURR:
—people think you’re crooked
Schuyler’s seat was up for grabs so I took it

1751
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:42,680
HAMILTON:
I’ve always considered you a friend

1752
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:44,740
BURR:
I don’t see why that has to end

1753
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:47,100
HAMILTON:
You changed parties to run against my father-in-law

1754
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:49,420
BURR:
I changed parties to seize the opportunity I saw

1755
01:34:49,420 --> 01:34:54,180
I swear your pride will be the death of us all
Beware, it goeth before the fall

1756
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:56,680
WASHINGTON:
The issue on the table:

1757
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:59,420
France is on the verge of war with England,

1758
01:34:59,420 --> 01:35:04,000
and do we provide aid and our troops to our French allies
or do we stay out of it?

1759
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:08,440
Remember, my decision on this matter is not subject
to congressional approval.

1760
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:13,540
The only person you have to convince is me.
Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir.

1761
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:15,300
JEFFERSON:
When we were on death’s door

1762
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:17,440
When we were needy
We made a promise

1763
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:20,920
We signed a treaty
We need money and guns and half a chance

1764
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:22,860
Uh, who provided those funds?

1765
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:23,480
MADISON:
France.

1766
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:25,820
JEFFERSON:
In return, they didn’t ask for land,

1767
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:28,820
Only a promise that we’d lend a hand
And stand with them

1768
01:35:28,820 --> 01:35:31,560
If they fought against oppressors
And revolution is messy

1769
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:34,060
But now is the time to stand!
Stand with our brothers

1770
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:37,760
As they fight against tyranny.
I know that Alexander Hamilton is here and he

1771
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:42,640
Would rather not have this debate;
I’ll remind you that he is not Secretary of State!

1772
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:47,680
He knows nothing of loyalty
Smells like new money, dresses like fake royalty

1773
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:52,540
Desperate to rise above his station,
Everything he does betrays the ideals of our nation.

1774
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:56,920
Hey, and if you don’t know, now you know, Mr. President.

1775
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:59,360
WASHINGTON
Thank you, Secretary Jefferson.

1776
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:02,480
Secretary Hamilton, your response?

1777
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:08,060
HAMILTON:
You must be out of your goddamn mind

1778
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:11,120
If you think
The President is going to bring the nation to the brink

1779
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:14,480
Of meddling in the middle of a military mess,
A game of chess,

1780
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:19,180
Where France is Queen and King-less.
We signed a treaty with a King whose head is now in a basket,

1781
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:23,300
Would you like to take it out and ask it?
Should we honor our treaty, King Louis’s head?

1782
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:25,840
“Uh, do whatever you want I’m super dead!”

1783
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,920
WASHINGTON:
Enough enough, Hamilton is right.

1784
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:28,780
JEFFERSON:
Mr. President!

1785
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:30,540
WASHINGTON:
We’re too fragile to start another fight.

1786
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:32,980
JEFFERSON:
But sir, do we not fight for freedom?

1787
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,240
WASHINGTON:
Sure, when the French figure out who’s gonna lead ‘em.

1788
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:36,580
JEFFERSON:
The people are leading!

1789
01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:38,740
WASHINGTON:
The people are rioting! There’s a difference!

1790
01:36:38,740 --> 01:36:42,560
Frankly it’s a little disquieting
You would let your ideals blind you to reality!

1791
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:43,200
Hamilton?

1792
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:43,460
HAMILTON:
Sir!

1793
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:45,000
WASHINGTON:
Draft the statement of neutrality.

1794
01:36:45,660 --> 01:36:47,300
JEFFERSON:
Did you forget Lafayette?

1795
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:48,240
HAMILTON:
What?

1796
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:49,720
JEFFERSON:
Have you an ounce of regret?

1797
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:54,480
You accumulate debt, you accumulate power.
Yet in their hour of need, you forget.

1798
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:56,900
HAMILTON:
Lafayette’s a smart man, he’ll be fine.

1799
01:36:56,900 --> 01:37:02,240
And before he was your friend, he was mine.
If we try to fight in every revolution in the world,

1800
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:04,140
We never stop. Where do we draw the line?

1801
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:05,260
JEFFERSON:
So quick witted.

1802
01:37:05,260 --> 01:37:06,380
HAMILTON:
Alas, I admit it.

1803
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:07,540
JEFFERSON:
I bet you were quite a lawyer.

1804
01:37:07,540 --> 01:37:08,900
HAMILTON:
My defendants got acquitted

1805
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:11,360
JEFFERSON:
Yeah, well someone ought to remind you

1806
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:11,860
HAMILTON:
What?

1807
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:14,140
JEFFERSON:
You’re nothing without Washington behind you.

1808
01:37:14,140 --> 01:37:14,600
WASHINGTON:
Hamilton!

1809
01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:16,340
JEFFERSON:
Daddy’s calling!

1810
01:37:26,860 --> 01:37:30,800
BURR:
It must be nice, it must be nice

1811
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:37,860
To have Washington on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice

1812
01:37:37,860 --> 01:37:41,220
To have Washington on your side

1813
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:44,700
JEFFERSON:
Ev'ry action has its equal, opposite reactions.

1814
01:37:44,700 --> 01:37:48,080
Thanks to Hamilton, our cabinet’s fractured into factions.

1815
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:51,700
Try not to crack under the stress,
we’re breaking down like fractions.

1816
01:37:51,700 --> 01:37:55,380
We smack each other in the press,
and we don’t print retractions.

1817
01:37:55,380 --> 01:38:02,480
I get no satisfaction witnessing his fits of passion
The way he primps and preens
and dresses like the pits of fashion

1818
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:09,760
Our poorest citizens, our farmers, live ration to ration
As Wall Street robs ‘em blind in search of chips to cash in

1819
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:12,980
This prick is asking for someone to bring him to task

1820
01:38:12,980 --> 01:38:16,740
Somebody give me some dirt on this vacuous mass
so we can at last unmask him

1821
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:20,340
I’ll pull the trigger on him,
someone load the gun and cock it

1822
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:24,000
While we were all watching,
he got Washington in his pocket

1823
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:31,360
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side

1824
01:38:38,540 --> 01:38:41,000
Look back at the Bill of Rights

1825
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,220
MADISON:
Which I wrote!

1826
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:43,960
BURR & JEFFERSON:
The ink hasn't dried

1827
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:52,500
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side

1828
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:54,260
MADISON:
So he’s doubled the size of the government

1829
01:38:54,260 --> 01:38:56,960
Wasn't the trouble with much of our previous government size?

1830
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:57,700
BURR:
Look in his eyes

1831
01:38:57,700 --> 01:38:58,600
JEFFERSON:
See how he lies

1832
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:00,540
MADISON:
Follow the scent of his enterprise

1833
01:39:00,540 --> 01:39:04,240
JEFFERSON:
Centralizing national credit and making
American credit competitive

1834
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:05,580
MADISON:
If we don’t stop it, we aid and abet it.

1835
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:06,720
JEFFERSON:
I have to resign!

1836
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:08,460
MADISON:
Somebody has to stand up for the South!

1837
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:10,160
BURR:
Well, somebody has to stand up to his mouth!

1838
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:11,940
JEFFERSON:
If there’s a fire you’re trying to douse

1839
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:14,000
You can’t put it out from inside the house!

1840
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:17,360
I’m in the cabinet, I am complicit
In watching him grabbin' at power and kiss it.

1841
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:21,400
If Washington isn’t gon’ listen to disciplined dissidents,
This is the difference, this kid is OUT!

1842
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:25,320
ALL:
OH! This immigrant isn’t somebody we chose!

1843
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:28,940
OH! This immigrant’s keeping us all on our toes!

1844
01:39:28,940 --> 01:39:32,580
OH! Let’s show these Federalists what they’re up against!

1845
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:36,180
OH! Southern motherfucking Democratic-Republicans!

1846
01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:39,740
OH! Let’s follow the money and see where it goes!

1847
01:39:39,740 --> 01:39:43,280
OH! Because every second, the treasury grows!

1848
01:39:43,420 --> 01:39:46,580
OH! If we follow the money and see where it leads

1849
01:39:46,580 --> 01:39:50,100
Get in the weeds, look for the seeds of Hamilton’s misdeeds!

1850
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:53,800
It must be nice, it must be nice…

1851
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:57,280
MADISON:
Follow the money and see where it goes!

1852
01:39:57,280 --> 01:40:00,920
ALL:
It must be nice, it must be nice…

1853
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:04,520
JEFFERSON:
The emperor has no clothes

1854
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:07,520
ALL:
We won’t be invisible

1855
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:10,520
We won’t be denied!

1856
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:11,720
Still…

1857
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:19,300
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side

1858
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:24,820
HAMILTON:
Mr. President, you asked to see me?

1859
01:40:24,820 --> 01:40:26,700
WASHINGTON:
I know you’re busy

1860
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:28,120
HAMILTON:
What do you need, sir?

1861
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:30,340
Sir?

1862
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:32,960
WASHINGTON:
I wanna give you a word of warning

1863
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:34,880
HAMILTON:
Sir, I don’t know what you heard

1864
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:37,880
But whatever it is, Jefferson started it

1865
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:41,700
WASHINGTON:
Thomas Jefferson resigned this morning

1866
01:40:41,940 --> 01:40:43,020
HAMILTON:
You’re kidding

1867
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,220
WASHINGTON:
I need a favor

1868
01:40:45,220 --> 01:40:48,540
HAMILTON:
Whatever you say, sir, Jefferson will pay for his behavior!

1869
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:50,220
WASHINGTON:
Shh. Talk less

1870
01:40:50,220 --> 01:40:51,160
HAMILTON:
I’ll use the press

1871
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:54,160
I’ll write under a pseudonym,
you’ll see what I can do to him

1872
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:56,460
WASHINGTON:
I need you to draft an address

1873
01:40:56,460 --> 01:40:57,740
HAMILTON:
Yes! He resigned.

1874
01:40:57,740 --> 01:40:59,100
You can finally speak your mind

1875
01:40:59,100 --> 01:40:59,620
WASHINGTON:
No ...

1876
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:02,880
He’s stepping down so he can run for President

1877
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,700
HAMILTON:
Ha! Good luck defeating you, sir.

1878
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:06,560
WASHINGTON:
I’m stepping down.

1879
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:08,640
I’m not running for President

1880
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:09,860
HAMILTON:
I’m sorry, what?

1881
01:41:09,860 --> 01:41:12,860
WASHINGTON:
One last time

1882
01:41:13,820 --> 01:41:18,140
Relax, have a drink with me
One last time

1883
01:41:18,660 --> 01:41:23,240
Let’s take a break tonight
And then we’ll teach them how to say goodbye

1884
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:28,220
To say goodbye
You and I

1885
01:41:29,660 --> 01:41:31,340
HAMILTON:
No, sir, why?

1886
01:41:31,340 --> 01:41:33,020
WASHINGTON:
I wanna talk about neutrality

1887
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:33,320
HAMILTON:
Sir

1888
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:37,100
With Britain and France on the verge of war,
is this the best time ...

1889
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:39,480
WASHINGTON:
I want to warn against partisan fighting

1890
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:39,840
HAMILTON:
But—

1891
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:42,100
WASHINGTON:
Pick up a pen, start writing

1892
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:47,140
I wanna talk about what I have learned
The hard-won wisdom I have earned

1893
01:41:47,140 --> 01:41:49,500
HAMILTON:
As far as the people are concerned

1894
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:52,420
You have to serve, you could continue to serve

1895
01:41:52,420 --> 01:41:52,700
WASHINGTON:
No!
You have to serve, you could continue to serve

1896
01:41:52,700 --> 01:41:53,360
WASHINGTON:
No!

1897
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:58,520
One last time
The people will hear from me

1898
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:03,740
One last time
And if we get this right

1899
01:42:03,740 --> 01:42:07,740
We’re gonna teach ‘em how to say
Goodbye

1900
01:42:07,740 --> 01:42:12,480
You and I

1901
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:18,140
HAMILTON:
Mr. President, they will say you’re weak

1902
01:42:18,140 --> 01:42:21,140
WASHINGTON:
No, they will see we’re strong

1903
01:42:21,140 --> 01:42:23,480
HAMILTON:
Your position is so unique

1904
01:42:23,480 --> 01:42:26,480
WASHINGTON:
So I’ll use it to move them along

1905
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,740
HAMILTON:
Why do you have to say goodbye?

1906
01:42:28,740 --> 01:42:32,620
WASHINGTON:
If I say goodbye, the nation learns to move on

1907
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:36,620
It outlives me when I’m gone

1908
01:42:37,340 --> 01:42:38,940
Like the scripture says:

1909
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:46,760
“Everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree
And no one shall make them afraid.”

1910
01:42:47,460 --> 01:42:50,800
They’ll be safe in the nation we’ve made

1911
01:42:52,660 --> 01:43:00,100
I wanna sit under my own vine and fig tree
A moment alone in the shade

1912
01:43:00,100 --> 01:43:08,100
At home in this nation we’ve made
One last time

1913
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:11,100
HAMILTON:
One last time

1914
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:22,780
Though, in reviewing the incidents of my administration,
I am unconscious of intentional error

1915
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:28,840
I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects
Not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors.

1916
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:32,540
I shall also carry with me
The hope

1917
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:35,540
That my country will
View them with indulgence

1918
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:42,420
And that after forty-five years of my life
Dedicated to its service with an upright zeal

1919
01:43:42,420 --> 01:43:52,340
The faults of incompetent abilities will be
Consigned to oblivion, as I myself must soon be to the mansions of rest

1920
01:43:53,260 --> 01:44:02,440
I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat in which
I promise myself to realize the sweet enjoyment of partaking

1921
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:13,260
In the midst of my fellow-citizens,
The benign influence of good laws under a free government
The ever-favorite object of my heart

1922
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:25,680
And the happy reward, as I trust
Of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers.

1923
01:44:26,140 --> 01:44:29,020
One last time

1924
01:44:29,020 --> 01:44:32,020
COMPANY:
George Washington’s going home!

1925
01:44:32,020 --> 01:44:35,020
HAMILTON:
Teach ‘em how to say goodbye

1926
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:36,800
COMPANY:
George Washington’s going home

1927
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:39,800
WASHINGTON:
You and I

1928
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:43,840
COMPANY:
George Washington’s going home

1929
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:46,840
WASHINGTON:
Going home

1930
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:49,160
COMPANY:
George Washington’s going home

1931
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:49,840
WASHINGTON:
History has its eyes on you
COMPANY:
George Washington’s going home

1932
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:51,880
WASHINGTON:
History has its eyes on you

1933
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:53,160
COMPANY:
George Washington’s going home
WASHINGTON:
History has its eyes on you

1934
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:55,380
COMPANY:
George Washington’s going home

1935
01:44:55,380 --> 01:44:57,600
WASHINGTON:
We’re gonna teach ‘em how to
Say goodbye!

1936
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,520
Teach ‘em how to
Say goodbye!

1937
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:02,520
To say goodbye!
Say goodbye!

1938
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:07,540
One last time!

1939
01:45:28,980 --> 01:45:31,180
KING GEORGE III:
They say

1940
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:36,720
George Washington's yielding his power and stepping away

1941
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:44,920
Is that true?
I wasn't aware that was something a person could do

1942
01:45:45,340 --> 01:45:52,400
I'm perplexed.
Are they going to keep on replacing whoever's in charge?

1943
01:45:52,400 --> 01:46:01,640
If so who's next?
There's nobody else in their country who looms quite as large

1944
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:05,780
John Adams?

1945
01:46:08,920 --> 01:46:12,500
I know him
That can't be

1946
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:18,460
That's that little guy who spoke to me
All those years ago

1947
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:24,760
What was it, '85?
That poor man they're going to eat him alive!

1948
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:32,320
Ocean's rise, empires fall
Next to Washington they all look small

1949
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:36,440
All alone, watch them run

1950
01:46:36,440 --> 01:46:41,700
They will tear each other in to pieces
Jesus Christ this will be fun!

1951
01:46:54,220 --> 01:46:56,880
President John Adams

1952
01:46:57,320 --> 01:46:58,540
Good luck!

1953
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:08,060
BURR:
How does Hamilton

1954
01:47:08,060 --> 01:47:11,840
the short-tempered, protean creator
of the coast guard,

1955
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:16,260
founder of the New York Post
ardently abuse his cabinet post

1956
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:21,960
destroy his reputation?
Welcome folks, to the Adam’s Administration.

1957
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:25,780
Jefferson’s the runner-up
which makes him the vice-president

1958
01:47:25,780 --> 01:47:27,420
JEFFERSON:
Washington can’t help you now

1959
01:47:27,420 --> 01:47:29,180
No more Mr. Nice President

1960
01:47:29,180 --> 01:47:30,480
BURR:
Adams fires Hamilton

1961
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:33,840
Privately calls him creole bastard in his toss

1962
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:35,990
Hamilton publishes his response.

1963
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,540
HAMILTON:
An open letter to the fat, arrogant

1964
01:47:37,550 --> 01:47:42,000
anti-charismatic national embarrassment
known as President John Adams

1965
01:47:42,100 --> 01:47:47,990
(Shit!)
The man's irrational, he claims that I'm in league
With Britain in some vast, international intrigue

1966
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,990
Bitch, please!
You wouldn't know what I'm doin'

1967
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,490
You're always goin' berserk
but you never show up to work

1968
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:59,700
Give my regards to Abigail
next time you write about my lack of moral compass

1969
01:47:59,710 --> 01:48:02,000
At least I'm doin' my job up in this rumpus

1970
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:05,000
(Oh!)
Oh and the line’s behind me,
I’ve crossed it again while the president lost it again

1971
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:07,500
Aww, such a rough life
Better run to ya' wife

1972
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:10,000
Yo, the boss is in Boston again
Lemme ask you a question: Who sits

1973
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:13,000
at your desk when you're in Massachusetts?
They were calling you a dick back in '76

1974
01:48:13,100 --> 01:48:16,300
And you haven't done anything new since!
You nuisance with no sense!

1975
01:48:16,310 --> 01:48:17,500
You will die of irrelevance!

1976
01:48:17,510 --> 01:48:20,600
Go ahead: You can call me the Devil
You aspire to my level
You aspire to malevolence!

1977
01:48:20,610 --> 01:48:22,400
Say hi to the Jeffersons!

1978
01:48:22,410 --> 01:48:24,500
And the spies all around me
Maybe they can confirm

1979
01:48:24,510 --> 01:48:28,000
I don't care if I kill my career with this letter
I'm confining you to one term

1980
01:48:28,580 --> 01:48:29,800
HAMILTON:
Sit down John

1981
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:32,800
You fat motherf-!

1982
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:34,560
JEFFERSON:
Hamilton’s out of control,

1983
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:35,280
MADISON:
This is great:

1984
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:38,000
He’s out of power,
he holds no office

1985
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:42,840
and he just destroyed president John Adams
the only other significant member of his party

1986
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:44,980
JEFFERSON:
Hamilton is a host unto himself

1987
01:48:44,980 --> 01:48:47,320
As long as he can hold a pen,
he’s a threat.

1988
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:49,260
Let’s let him know what we know.

1989
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:52,720
HAMILTON:
Mr. Vice President

1990
01:48:54,580 --> 01:48:55,560
Mr. Madison

1991
01:48:56,740 --> 01:48:57,980
Senator Burr

1992
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:00,540
What is this?

1993
01:49:01,260 --> 01:49:03,760
JEFFERSON:
We have the check stubs. From separate accounts…

1994
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:06,560
MADISON:
Almost a thousand dollars, paid in different amounts…

1995
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:08,080
BURR:
To a Mr. James Reynolds

1996
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:09,940
Way back in
Seventeen ninety-one

1997
01:49:09,940 --> 01:49:12,040
HAMILTON:
Is that what you have? Are you done?

1998
01:49:12,040 --> 01:49:14,860
MADISON:
You are uniquely situated by virtue of your position

1999
01:49:14,860 --> 01:49:18,020
JEFFERSON:
Though ‘virtue’ is not a word I’d apply to this situation

2000
01:49:18,020 --> 01:49:20,500
MADISON:
To seek financial gain, to stray from your sacred mission

2001
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:23,500
JEFFERSON:
And the evidence suggests you’ve engaged in speculation

2002
01:49:23,500 --> 01:49:26,040
BURR:
An immigrant embezzling our government funds

2003
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:29,040
JEFFERSON/MADISON:
I can almost see the headline, your career is done

2004
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:32,040
BURR:
I hope you saved some money for your daughter and sons

2005
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:35,040
BURR/JEFFERSON/MADISON:
Ya best g'wan run back where ya come from!

2006
01:49:35,300 --> 01:49:35,880
HAMILTON:
Ha!

2007
01:49:36,260 --> 01:49:39,220
You don’t even know what you’re asking me to confess

2008
01:49:39,220 --> 01:49:40,600
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR:
Confess

2009
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:41,360
HAMILTON:
You have nothing.

2010
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:45,160
I don’t have to tell you anything at all
Unless

2011
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:46,100
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR:
Unless

2012
01:49:46,100 --> 01:49:48,460
HAMILTON:
If I can prove that I never broke the law

2013
01:49:48,460 --> 01:49:51,460
Do you promise not to tell another soul what you saw?

2014
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:54,460
BURR:
No one else was in the room where it happened

2015
01:49:54,460 --> 01:49:55,860
HAMILTON:
Is that a yes?

2016
01:49:55,860 --> 01:49:57,420
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR:
Um, yes

2017
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:00,440
BURR:
“Dear Sir,

2018
01:50:00,440 --> 01:50:05,300
I hope this letter finds you in good health
And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth

2019
01:50:05,300 --> 01:50:10,380
In the pockets of people like me: down on their luck
You see, it was my wife who you decided to”

2020
01:50:10,380 --> 01:50:11,160
JEFFERSON:
Whaaaat—

2021
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:12,140
HAMILTON:
She courted me

2022
01:50:12,140 --> 01:50:16,740
Escorted me to bed and when she had me in a corner
That’s when Reynolds extorted me

2023
01:50:16,740 --> 01:50:18,660
For a sordid fee
I paid him quarterly

2024
01:50:18,660 --> 01:50:22,180
I may have mortally wounded my prospects
But my papers are orderly!

2025
01:50:22,180 --> 01:50:25,940
As you can see I kept a record
Of every check in my checkered history

2026
01:50:25,940 --> 01:50:30,860
Check it again against your list n’ see consistency
I never spent a cent that wasn’t mine

2027
01:50:30,860 --> 01:50:35,800
You sent the dogs after my scent, that’s fine
Yes, I have reasons for shame

2028
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:42,340
But I have not committed treason and sullied my good name
As you can see I have done nothing to provoke legal action

2029
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:45,340
Are my answers to your satisfaction?

2030
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:47,140
JEFFERSON:
My God

2031
01:50:48,540 --> 01:50:49,760
MADISON:
Gentlemen, let’s go

2032
01:50:51,020 --> 01:50:51,580
HAMILTON:
So?

2033
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:55,020
JEFFERSON AND MADISON:
The people won't know what we know

2034
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:56,060
HAMILTON:
Burr!

2035
01:50:56,060 --> 01:51:00,820
How do I know you won’t use this against me
The next time we go toe to toe?

2036
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:03,820
BURR:
Alexander, rumors only grow.

2037
01:51:03,820 --> 01:51:06,820
And we both
Know what we know

2038
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:27,120
HAMILTON:
In the eye of a hurricane
There is quiet

2039
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:34,080
For just a moment
A yellow sky

2040
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:39,960
When I was seventeen a hurricane
Destroyed my town

2041
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:45,180
I didn’t drown
I couldn’t seem to die

2042
01:51:45,820 --> 01:51:53,540
I wrote my way out
Wrote everything down far as I could see

2043
01:51:54,600 --> 01:52:01,840
I wrote my way out
I looked up and the town had its eyes on me

2044
01:52:03,240 --> 01:52:08,920
They passed a plate around
Total strangers

2045
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:14,140
Moved to kindness by my story

2046
01:52:15,700 --> 01:52:21,140
Raised enough for me to book passage on a
Ship that was New York bound…

2047
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:25,360
I wrote my way out of hell
I wrote my way to revolution

2048
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:29,900
I was louder than the crack in the bell
I wrote Eliza love letters until she fell

2049
01:52:29,900 --> 01:52:32,900
I wrote about The Constitution and defended it well

2050
01:52:32,900 --> 01:52:38,720
And in the face of ignorance and resistance
I wrote financial systems into existence

2051
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:44,580
And when my prayers to God were met with indifference
I picked up a pen, I wrote my own deliverance

2052
01:52:44,580 --> 01:52:48,200
In the eye of a hurricane
There is quiet

2053
01:52:49,180 --> 01:52:55,120
For just a moment
A yellow sky

2054
01:52:56,120 --> 01:53:00,740
I was twelve when my mother died
She was holding me

2055
01:53:00,740 --> 01:53:07,120
We were sick and she was holding me
I couldn’t seem to die

2056
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:09,700
BURR:
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it…

2057
01:53:09,700 --> 01:53:11,180
HAMILTON:
I’ll write my way out…

2058
01:53:11,180 --> 01:53:12,700
BURR AND ENSEMBLE:
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it…

2059
01:53:12,700 --> 01:53:17,160
HAMILTON:
Write ev’rything down, far as I can see…

2060
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:18,780
BURR AND ENSEMBLE:
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait…

2061
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:24,320
HAMILTON:
I’ll write my way out…
Overwhelm them with honesty.

2062
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:30,100
This is the eye of the hurricane, this is the only
Way I can protect my legacy…

2063
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:33,100
COMPANY:
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait…

2064
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:34,880
HAMILTON:
The Reynolds Pamphlet

2065
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:39,160
COMPANY:
The Reynolds Pamphlet

2066
01:53:40,860 --> 01:53:42,080
JEFFERSON/MADISON/ANGELICA:
Have you read this?

2067
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:45,860
BURR/JEFFERSON/MADISON:
Alexander Hamilton had a torrid affair

2068
01:53:45,860 --> 01:53:48,040
And he wrote it down right there

2069
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:49,180
MADISON:
Highlights!

2070
01:53:49,180 --> 01:53:50,240
HAMILTON/JEFFERSON:
“The charge against me

2071
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:52,220
Is a connection with one
James Reynolds!

2072
01:53:52,220 --> 01:53:55,220
For purposes of
Improper speculation

2073
01:53:55,220 --> 01:53:58,640
My real crime is an
Amorous connection with his wife

2074
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:01,940
For a considerable time
With his knowing consent

2075
01:54:01,940 --> 01:54:03,000
MADISON/BURR/JEFFERSON:
Damn!

2076
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:06,540
HAMILTON/JEFFERSON/MADISON:
“I had frequent meetings with her
Most of them at my own house.”

2077
01:54:06,540 --> 01:54:07,160
BURR:
At his own house!

2078
01:54:07,160 --> 01:54:08,100
MADISON:
At his own house!

2079
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:08,880
DEEP VOICE:
Damn!

2080
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:13,140
HAMILTON/JEFFERSON:
“Mrs. Hamilton with our children being absent
On a visit to her father.”

2081
01:54:13,140 --> 01:54:13,920
MADISON/BURR:
No…

2082
01:54:14,160 --> 01:54:15,000
COMPANY:
Boooo!

2083
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:15,740
MADISON/BURR:
Have you read this?

2084
01:54:15,740 --> 01:54:17,780
JEFFERSON:
Well, he’s never gon’ be President now

2085
01:54:17,780 --> 01:54:19,460
MADISON/BURR:
Never gon’ be President now

2086
01:54:19,460 --> 01:54:21,260
JEFFERSON:
Well, he’s never gon’ be President now

2087
01:54:21,260 --> 01:54:22,940

JEFFERSON:
He’s never gon’ be President now

2089
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:26,360
MADISON/BURR:
Never gon’ be President now

2090
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:27,520
JEFFERSON:
That’s one less thing to worry about

2091
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:29,880
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR:
That’s one less thing to worry about!

2092
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:32,160
ANGELICA:
I came as soon as I heard

2093
01:54:32,160 --> 01:54:32,820
JEFFERSON:
What?!

2094
01:54:32,820 --> 01:54:33,700
HAMILTON:
Angelica

2095
01:54:33,700 --> 01:54:35,120
COMPANY:
All the way from London?!

2096
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:36,140
Damn

2097
01:54:36,140 --> 01:54:37,400
HAMILTON:
Angelica, thank God

2098
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:40,400
Someone who understands what I’m
Struggling here to do

2099
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:42,200
ANGELICA:
I’m not here for you

2100
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:43,080
COMPANY:
Oooooh!

2101
01:54:43,080 --> 01:54:46,080
ANGELICA:
I know my sister like I know my own mind

2102
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:52,700
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
I love my sister more than anything in this life

2103
01:54:52,700 --> 01:54:56,480
I will choose her happiness over mine every time

2104
01:54:56,480 --> 01:55:00,000
Put what we had aside
I’m standing at her side

2105
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,940
You could never be satisfied
God, I hope you’re satisfied

2106
01:55:03,940 --> 01:55:06,640
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR:
Well, he’s never gon’ be President now

2107
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:08,540
Well, he’s never gon’ be President now

2108
01:55:13,220 --> 01:55:15,800
That’s one less thing to worry about.

2109
01:55:17,260 --> 01:55:18,240
JEFFERSON/MADISON/HAMILTON:
Hey!

2110
01:55:18,240 --> 01:55:21,240
At least he was
honest with our money!

2111
01:55:21,240 --> 01:55:23,480
Well he’s never gon’
be President now

2112
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:24,880
Hey!

2113
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:27,880
At least he was honest
with our money!

2114
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:30,880
That’s one less thing
to worry about.

2115
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:33,880
The Reynolds Pamphlet

2116
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:36,880
Have you read this?

2117
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:40,700
You ever see somebody ruin their own life?

2118
01:55:42,980 --> 01:55:43,940
His poor wife

2119
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:02,780
ELIZA HAMILTON
I saved every letter you wrote me

2120
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:07,380
From the moment I read them
I knew you were mine

2121
01:56:07,380 --> 01:56:11,860
You said you were mine
I thought you were mine

2122
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:20,800
Do you know what Angelica said
When we saw your first letter arrive?

2123
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:27,880
She said: "Be careful with that one, love
he will do what it takes to survive."

2124
01:56:27,880 --> 01:56:35,160
You and your words flooded my senses
Your sentences left me defenseless

2125
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:42,400
You built me palaces out of paragraphs
You built cathedrals

2126
01:56:43,300 --> 01:56:49,880
I'm re-reading the letters you wrote me
I'm searching and scanning for answers

2127
01:56:49,880 --> 01:56:53,180
In every line
For some kind of sign

2128
01:56:53,180 --> 01:57:01,860
And when you were mine
The world seemed to burn

2129
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:11,260
Burn

2130
01:57:12,660 --> 01:57:19,440
You published the letters she wrote you
You told the whole world how you brought this girl

2131
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:20,880
Into our bed

2132
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:27,160
In clearing your name
You have ruined our lives

2133
01:57:28,300 --> 01:57:33,820
Do you know what Angelica said
When she read what you'd done?

2134
01:57:33,820 --> 01:57:41,020
She said: "You have married an Icarus.
He has flown too close to the sun."

2135
01:57:41,020 --> 01:57:48,640
You and your words obsessed with your legacy
Your sentences border on senseless

2136
01:57:48,640 --> 01:57:56,000
And you are paranoid in every paragraph
How they perceive you-

2137
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,000
You, you, you

2138
01:58:03,680 --> 01:58:11,480
I'm erasing myself from the narrative
Let future historians wonder

2139
01:58:11,480 --> 01:58:16,380
How Eliza reacted
When you broke her heart

2140
01:58:16,380 --> 01:58:26,000
You have torn it all apart
I'm watching it burn

2141
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:31,860
Watching it burn

2142
01:58:32,300 --> 01:58:37,560
The world has no right to my heart
The world has no place in our bed

2143
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:42,460
They don't get to know what I said
I'm burning the memories

2144
01:58:42,460 --> 01:58:46,500
Burning the letters
that might have redeemed you

2145
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:51,880
You forfeit all rights to my heart
You forfeit the place in our bed

2146
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:54,880
You'll sleep in your office instead

2147
01:58:54,880 --> 01:59:01,080
With only the memories
of when you were mine

2148
01:59:09,320 --> 01:59:21,020
I hope that you burn

2149
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:33,800
PHILIP:
Meet the latest graduate of King’s College!

2150
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:39,900
I prob’ly shouldn’t brag, but, dag, I amaze and astonish!
The scholars say
I got the same virtuosity and brains as my pops!

2151
01:59:39,900 --> 01:59:45,280
The ladies say my brain’s not where the resemblance stops!
I’m only nineteen but my mind is older

2152
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:50,160
Gotta be my own man, like my father, but bolder
I shoulder his legacy with pride

2153
01:59:50,160 --> 01:59:52,420
I used to hear him say
That someday I would—

2154
01:59:52,420 --> 01:59:53,920
ENSEMBLE:
Blow us all away!

2155
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:56,200
PHILIP:
Ladies, I’m lookin for a Mr. George Eacker

2156
01:59:56,200 --> 02:00:02,060
Made a speech last week, our Fourth of July speaker
He disparaged my father’s legacy in front of a crowd

2157
02:00:02,060 --> 02:00:04,240
I can’t have that, I’m making my father proud

2158
02:00:04,240 --> 02:00:06,820
MARTHA:
I saw him just up Broadway a couple of blocks

2159
02:00:06,820 --> 02:00:08,300
He was goin’ to see a play

2160
02:00:08,300 --> 02:00:09,620
PHILIP:
Well, I’ll go visit his box

2161
02:00:09,620 --> 02:00:10,740
DOLLY:
God, you’re a fox

2162
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:12,160
PHILIP:
And y’all look pretty good in ya’ frocks

2163
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:15,160
How ‘bout when I get back,
we all strip down to our socks?

2164
02:00:15,160 --> 02:00:16,700
BOTH:
Ok!

2165
02:00:16,700 --> 02:00:18,320
COMPANY:
Blow us all away!

2166
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:26,640
PHILIP:
George!

2167
02:00:26,740 --> 02:00:27,300
GEORGE:
Shh

2168
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:27,820
PHILIP:
George!

2169
02:00:27,820 --> 02:00:28,900
GEORGE:
Shh! I’m tryin’ to watch the show!

2170
02:00:28,900 --> 02:00:31,620
PHILIP:
Ya’ shoulda watched your mouth before you
Talked about my father though!

2171
02:00:31,620 --> 02:00:34,040
GEORGE:
I didn’t say anything that wasn’t true

2172
02:00:34,040 --> 02:00:36,760
You father’s a scoundrel, and so, it seems, are you

2173
02:00:36,760 --> 02:00:37,480
ENSEMBLE:
Ooooooooooh!

2174
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:38,400
PHILIP:
It’s like that?

2175
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:41,480
GEORGE:
Yeah, I don’t fool around
I’m not your little schoolboy friends

2176
02:00:41,480 --> 02:00:42,580
PHILIP:
See you on the dueling ground

2177
02:00:42,580 --> 02:00:45,040
That is, unless you wanna step outside and go now

2178
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:48,040
GEORGE:
I know where to find you, piss off
I’m watchin’ this show now

2179
02:00:53,080 --> 02:00:54,380
PHILIP:
Pops, if you had only heard

2180
02:00:54,380 --> 02:00:58,140
The shit he said about you
I doubt you would have let it slide and I was not about to—

2181
02:00:58,140 --> 02:00:58,280
HAMILTON:
Slow down
The shit he said about you
I doubt you would have let it slide and I was not about to—

2182
02:00:58,280 --> 02:00:59,040
HAMILTON:
Slow down

2183
02:00:59,040 --> 02:00:59,200
PHILIP:
I came to ask you for advice.
HAMILTON:
Slow down

2184
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:00,180
PHILIP:
I came to ask you for advice.

2185
02:01:00,180 --> 02:01:03,840
This is my very first duel
They don’t exactly cover this subject in boarding school

2186
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:06,260
HAMILTON:
Did your friends attempt to negotiate a peace?

2187
02:01:06,260 --> 02:01:09,460
PHILIP:
He refused to apologize, we had to let the peace talks cease

2188
02:01:09,460 --> 02:01:10,660
HAMILTON:
Where is this happening?

2189
02:01:10,660 --> 02:01:12,600
PHILIP:
Across the river, in Jersey

2190
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:14,580
HAMILTON/PHILIP:
Everything is legal in New Jersey…

2191
02:01:14,580 --> 02:01:15,620
HAMILTON
Alright.

2192
02:01:15,620 --> 02:01:20,020
So this is what you’re gonna do:
Stand there like a man until Eacker is in front of you

2193
02:01:20,020 --> 02:01:25,320
When the time comes, fire your weapon in the air
This will put an end to the whole affair

2194
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:27,940
PHILIP:
But what if he decides to shoot? Then I’m a goner

2195
02:01:27,940 --> 02:01:30,720
HAMILTON:
No. He’ll follow suit if he’s truly a man of honor

2196
02:01:30,720 --> 02:01:36,340
To take someone’s life, that is something you can’t shake
Philip, your mother can’t take another heartbreak

2197
02:01:36,340 --> 02:01:36,980
PHILIP:
Father—

2198
02:01:36,980 --> 02:01:41,200
HAMILTON:
Promise me. You don’t want this
Young man’s blood on your conscience

2199
02:01:41,200 --> 02:01:42,340
PHILIP:
Okay, I promise

2200
02:01:42,340 --> 02:01:43,940
HAMILTON:
Come back home when you’re done

2201
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:46,940
Take my guns. Be smart. Make me proud, son

2202
02:01:46,940 --> 02:01:48,480
PHILIP:
My name is Philip

2203
02:01:48,480 --> 02:01:52,740
I am a poet
I’m a little nervous, but I can’t show it

2204
02:01:52,740 --> 02:01:57,680
I’m sorry, I’m a Hamilton with pride
You talk about my father, I cannot let it slide

2205
02:01:57,980 --> 02:02:00,900
Mister Eacker! How was the rest of your show?

2206
02:02:00,900 --> 02:02:02,340
GEORGE:
I’d rather skip the pleasantries

2207
02:02:02,340 --> 02:02:04,520
Let’s go
Grab your pistol

2208
02:02:04,520 --> 02:02:05,660
PHILIP:
Confer with your men

2209
02:02:05,660 --> 02:02:08,360
The duel will commence after we count to ten

2210
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:09,180
ENSEMBLE:
Count to ten!

2211
02:02:09,180 --> 02:02:11,260
PHILIP:
Look ‘em in the eye, aim no higher

2212
02:02:11,260 --> 02:02:16,980
Summon all the courage you require
Then slowly and clearly aim your gun towards the sky—

2213
02:02:16,980 --> 02:02:18,180
MALE ENSEMBLE:
One two three four

2214
02:02:18,180 --> 02:02:19,120
FULL ENSEMBLE:
Five six seven

2215
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:30,560
ENSEMBLE WOMEN:
Stay alive…

2216
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:32,240
Stay alive…

2217
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:33,220
HAMILTON:
Where’s my son?

2218
02:02:33,220 --> 02:02:34,700
DOCTOR:
Mr. Hamilton, come in.

2219
02:02:34,700 --> 02:02:37,720
They brought him in a half an hour ago.
He lost a lot of blood on the way over.

2220
02:02:37,720 --> 02:02:38,420
HAMILTON:
Is he alive?
They brought him in a half an hour ago.
He lost a lot of blood on the way over.

2221
02:02:38,420 --> 02:02:38,800
HAMILTON:
Is he alive?

2222
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:40,700
DOCTOR:
Yes. But you have to understand

2223
02:02:40,700 --> 02:02:42,900
The bullet entered just above his hip and
Lodged in his right arm

2224
02:02:42,900 --> 02:02:43,900
HAMILTON:
Can I see him please?
The bullet entered just above his hip and
Lodged in his right arm

2225
02:02:43,900 --> 02:02:44,420
HAMILTON:
Can I see him please?

2226
02:02:44,420 --> 02:02:46,200
DOCTOR:
I’m doing ev’rything I can

2227
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:49,200
But the wound was
Already infected when he arrived—

2228
02:02:51,340 --> 02:02:52,580
HAMILTON:
Philip

2229
02:02:54,360 --> 02:02:55,300
PHILIP:
Pa

2230
02:02:56,520 --> 02:03:02,540
I did exactly as you said, Pa
I held my head up high

2231
02:03:02,540 --> 02:03:05,540
HAMILTON:
I know, I know.
Shh, I know, I know

2232
02:03:05,540 --> 02:03:08,540
Shh. I know you did
Ev’rything just right

2233
02:03:08,540 --> 02:03:11,540
PHILIP:
Even before we got to ten

2234
02:03:11,540 --> 02:03:14,540

Shh, I know, I know

Stay alive…

Who did this, Alexander, did you know?

Mom, I’m so sorry for forgetting what you taught me

You changed the melody every time

ANGELICA:
There are moments that the words don’t reach

2264
02:04:38,780 --> 02:04:42,220
There is suffering too terrible to name

2265
02:04:42,220 --> 02:04:50,020
You hold your child as tight as you can
And push away the unimaginable

2266
02:04:50,020 --> 02:04:57,380
The moments when you’re in so deep
It feels easier to just swim down

2267
02:04:57,380 --> 02:05:04,860
The Hamiltons move uptown
And learn to live with the unimaginable

2268

HAMILTON:
I spend hours in the garden

2269
02:05:08,700 --> 02:05:14,260
I walk alone to the store
And it’s quiet uptown

2270
02:05:16,120 --> 02:05:19,020
I never liked the quiet before

2271
02:05:19,300 --> 02:05:26,040
I take the children to church on Sunday
A sign of the cross at the door

2272
02:05:26,600 --> 02:05:28,640
And I pray

2273
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:34,100
That never used to happen before

If you see him in the street

Walking by himself, talking to himself
Have pity

Philip, you would like it uptown

2277
02:05:43,680 --> 02:05:45,540
It’s quiet uptown

He is working through the unimaginable

His hair has gone grey.

2280
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:55,920
He passes every day
They say he walks the length of the city

You knock me out, I fall apart

Look at where we are

2284
02:06:15,460 --> 02:06:17,120
Look at where we started

2285
02:06:18,100 --> 02:06:22,760
I know I don’t deserve you, Eliza
But hear me out

2286
02:06:23,060 --> 02:06:24,620
That would be enough

2287
02:06:26,040 --> 02:06:32,760
If I could spare his life
If I could trade his life for mine

2288
02:06:33,480 --> 02:06:37,560
He’d be standing here right now
And you would smile

2289
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:39,260
And that would be enough

2290
02:06:41,320 --> 02:06:47,820
I don’t pretend to know
The challenges we’re facing

2291
02:06:48,600 --> 02:06:54,380
I know there’s no replacing what we’ve lost
And you need time

02:06:56,140 --> 02:06:58,060
But I’m not afraid

2293
02:06:59,020 --> 02:07:01,340
I know who I married

2294
02:07:02,760 --> 02:07:06,020
Just let me stay here by your side

Taking in the sights of the city

Look around, look around, Eliza

There are moments that the words don’t reach

There is a grace too powerful to name
We push away what we can never understand

We push away the unimaginable

2306

They are standing in the garden
Alexander by Eliza’s side

2307
02:08:01,960 --> 02:08:04,960

Forgiveness. Can you imagine?

Side, talking by her side, have pity

The Election of 1800!

Can we get back to politics?

MADISON:
Please?

2316
02:09:02,740 --> 02:09:07,020
JEFFERSON:
Yo, every action has its equal opposite reaction

2317
02:09:07,020 --> 02:09:10,700
John Adams shat the bed
I love the guy, but he’s in traction

2318
02:09:10,700 --> 02:09:17,700
Poor Alexander Hamilton, he is missing in action
So now I’m facing Aaron Burr with his own faction

2319
02:09:17,700 --> 02:09:21,180
MADISON:
He’s very attractive in the North
New Yorkers like his chances

2320
02:09:21,180 --> 02:09:25,040
JEFFERSON:
He’s not very forthcoming on any particular stances

2321
02:09:25,040 --> 02:09:28,280
MADISON:
Ask him a question, it glances off
He obfuscates, he dances

2322
02:09:28,280 --> 02:09:31,760
JEFFERSON:
And they say I’m a Francophile
At least they know I know where France is

2323
02:09:31,760 --> 02:09:35,320
MADISON:
Thomas, that’s the problem
See, they see Burr as a less extreme you

2324
02:09:35,320 --> 02:09:39,040
You need to change course
A key endorsement might redeem you

2325
02:09:39,040 --> 02:09:41,080
JEFFERSON:
Who did you have in mind?

2326
02:09:41,500 --> 02:09:42,080

Don’t laugh

02:09:42,760 --> 02:09:43,580
JEFFERSON:
Who is it?

2328
02:09:43,640 --> 02:09:45,980

You used to work on the same staff.

2329
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:46,260
JEFFERSON:
Whaaaat?

2330
02:09:46,260 --> 02:09:47,200

It might be nice, it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side
JEFFERSON:
Whaaaat?

02:09:47,200 --> 02:09:53,580

It might be nice, it might be nice

It might be nice, it might be nice

AARON BURR:
Talk less!

2334
02:10:02,260 --> 02:10:03,520
Smile more!

2335
02:10:03,980 --> 02:10:07,140
Don't let them know what you're against
Or what you're for!

Shake hands with him!

Charm her!

I don’t like Adams!

Well, he’s gonna lose, that’s just defeatist.

2341
02:10:18,040 --> 02:10:20,400
And Jefferson? In love with France!

2342
02:10:20,440 --> 02:10:21,760
Yeah, he’s so elitist!

2343
02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:25,280
I like that Aaron Burr!
I can’t believe we’re here with him!

2344
02:10:25,280 --> 02:10:28,580
He seems approachable?
Like you could grab a beer with him

Dear Mr. Hamilton

But if you had to choose…

Dear Mr. Hamilton

02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:55,480
John Adams doesn’t stand a chance
So who you are you promoting?

But if you had to choose!

Well, if isn’t Aaron Burr, sir.

2357
02:10:59,780 --> 02:11:00,920
BURR:
Alexander!

2358

You’ve created quite a stir, sir.

2359
02:11:02,840 --> 02:11:04,100
BURR:
I’m going door to door!

2360
02:11:04,100 --> 02:11:05,640
HAMILTON:
You’re openly campaigning?

2361
02:11:05,640 --> 02:11:06,140
BURR:
Sure!

2362
02:11:06,140 --> 02:11:07,000
HAMILTON:
That’s new.

2363
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:08,720
BURR:
Honestly, it’s kind of draining

2364
02:11:08,720 --> 02:11:09,160
HAMILTON:
Burr?

2365
02:11:09,160 --> 02:11:09,560
BURR:
Sir?

2366
02:11:09,560 --> 02:11:11,580
HAMILTON:
Is there anything you wouldn’t do?

2367
02:11:11,580 --> 02:11:13,980
BURR:
No, I’m chasing what I want, and you know what?

2368
02:11:14,120 --> 02:11:14,720
HAMILTON:
What?

2369
02:11:15,060 --> 02:11:16,780
BURR:
I learned that from you

2370
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:20,800
ENSEMBLE:
If you had to choose, if you had to choose…

Yo

2381
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:38,260
The people are asking to hear my voice

2382
02:11:38,260 --> 02:11:41,260
But the country is facing a difficult choice

2383
02:11:41,260 --> 02:11:44,800
And you were to ask me who I’d promote…

2384
02:11:46,680 --> 02:11:48,140
…Jefferson has my vote

2385
02:11:49,720 --> 02:11:51,960
I have never agreed with Jefferson once…

2386
02:11:53,500 --> 02:11:55,660
We have fought on like 75 different fronts

2387
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,140
But when all said and all is done…

2388
02:11:59,140 --> 02:12:02,520
Jefferson has beliefs; Burr has none

2389
02:12:02,560 --> 02:12:02,980

Ooooh!

2390
02:12:02,980 --> 02:12:06,540

And… you won in a landslide

2394
02:12:17,500 --> 02:12:20,020
BURR:
Congrats on a race well won

2395
02:12:20,500 --> 02:12:22,460
I did give you a fight.

2396
02:12:23,140 --> 02:12:24,100
JEFFERSON:
Uh-huh…

2397
02:12:24,100 --> 02:12:26,320
BURR:
I look forward to our partnership.

2398
02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:27,280
JEFFERSON:
Our partnership?

2399
02:12:27,280 --> 02:12:28,880
BURR:
As your vice president!

2400
02:12:28,880 --> 02:12:31,880
JEFFERSON:
Yeah, right!

2401
02:12:31,880 --> 02:12:33,160
You hear this guy?

2402
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:37,720
Man openly campaigns against me
Talking ‘bout “I look forward to our partnership!”

2403
02:12:37,720 --> 02:12:41,280
MADISON:
It is crazy that the guy who comes in second
gets to be vice president

2404
02:12:41,280 --> 02:12:43,920
JEFFERSON:
Ooh! Y’know what, we can change that!
Y’know why?

2405
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:44,180
MADISON:
Why?

2406
02:12:44,180 --> 02:12:46,000
JEFFERSON:
‘Cause I’m the president!

2407
02:12:47,360 --> 02:12:48,400
Burr, uh…

2408
02:12:48,740 --> 02:12:52,340
When you see Hamilton, thank him for the endorsement.

2409
02:12:59,120 --> 02:13:00,320
BURR:
How does Hamilton

2410
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:03,020
An arrogant
Immigrant, orphan

2411
02:13:03,020 --> 02:13:04,740
Bastard, whoreson

2412
02:13:04,740 --> 02:13:08,100
Somehow endorse
Thomas Jefferson, his enemy

2413
02:13:08,100 --> 02:13:13,460
A man he’s despised since the beginning
Just to keep me from winning?

2414
02:13:13,460 --> 02:13:16,700
I wanna be in the room where it happens

2415
02:13:16,700 --> 02:13:20,360
The room where it happens
The room where it happens

2416
02:13:20,360 --> 02:13:24,060
You’ve kept me from
The room where it happens

2417
02:13:24,060 --> 02:13:27,060
For the last time

2418
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:36,400
Dear Alexander:

2419
02:13:36,860 --> 02:13:41,160
I am slow to anger
But I toe the line

2420
02:13:41,160 --> 02:13:45,240
As I reckon with the effects
Of your life on mine

2421
02:13:45,240 --> 02:13:49,800
I look back on where I failed
And in every place I checked

2422
02:13:49,800 --> 02:13:53,760
The only common thread has been your disrespect

2423
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:58,440
Now you call me “amoral,”
A “dangerous disgrace,”

2424
02:13:58,440 --> 02:14:00,280
If you’ve got something to say

2425
02:14:00,280 --> 02:14:03,280
Name a time and place
Face to face

2426
02:14:03,280 --> 02:14:08,560
I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant

2427
02:14:08,560 --> 02:14:10,240
A dot Burr

2428
02:14:10,580 --> 02:14:11,900
HAMILTON:
Mr. Vice President:

2429
02:14:11,900 --> 02:14:15,580
I am not the reason no one trusts you
No one knows what you believe

2430
02:14:15,580 --> 02:14:19,980
I will not equivocate on my opinion
I have always worn it on my sleeve

2431
02:14:19,980 --> 02:14:24,600
Even if I said what you think I said
You would need to cite a more specific grievance

2432
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:28,020
Here’s an itemized list of thirty years of disagreements

2433
02:14:28,020 --> 02:14:28,960
BURR:
Sweet Jesus

2434
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:30,480
HAMILTON:
Hey, I have not been shy

2435
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:34,320
I am just a guy in the public eye
Tryin’ to do my best for our republic

2436
02:14:34,320 --> 02:14:38,040
I don’t wanna fight
But I won’t apologize for doing what’s right

2437
02:14:38,040 --> 02:14:43,040
I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant

2438
02:14:43,100 --> 02:14:44,840
A dot Ham

2439
02:14:46,760 --> 02:14:51,040
BURR:
Careful how you proceed, good man
Intemperate indeed, good man

2440
02:14:51,040 --> 02:14:55,560
Answer for the accusations I lay at your feet or
Prepare to bleed, good man

2441
02:14:55,560 --> 02:14:57,040
HAMILTON:
Burr, your grievance is legitimate

2442
02:14:57,040 --> 02:15:01,080
I stand by what I said, every bit of it
You stand only for yourself

2443
02:15:01,080 --> 02:15:03,960
It’s what you do
I can’t apologize because it’s true

2444
02:15:03,960 --> 02:15:05,700
BURR:
Then stand, Alexander

2445
02:15:06,180 --> 02:15:10,280
Weehawken. Dawn
Guns. Drawn

2446
02:15:10,540 --> 02:15:11,320
HAMILTON:
You’re on

2447
02:15:12,740 --> 02:15:17,740
BURR AND HAMILTON:
I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant

2448
02:15:18,540 --> 02:15:19,760
HAMILTON:
A dot Ham

2449
02:15:20,660 --> 02:15:21,820
BURR:
A dot Burr

2450
02:15:36,260 --> 02:15:39,180
ELIZA:
Alexander, come back to sleep

2451
02:15:39,180 --> 02:15:42,180
HAMILTON:
I have an early meeting out of town

2452
02:15:42,180 --> 02:15:44,860
ELIZA:
It's still dark outside

2453
02:15:44,860 --> 02:15:48,540
HAMILTON:
I know, I just need to write something down

2454
02:15:48,540 --> 02:15:51,560
ELIZA:
Why do you write like you're running out of time?

2455
02:15:51,560 --> 02:15:52,460
HAMILTON:
Shh

2456
02:15:52,460 --> 02:15:55,460
ELIZA:
Come back to bed, that would be enough

2457
02:15:56,400 --> 02:15:58,920
HAMILTON:
I'll be back before you know I'm gone

2458
02:15:58,920 --> 02:16:00,980
ELIZA:
Come back to sleep

2459
02:16:00,980 --> 02:16:02,320
HAMILTON:
This meeting's at dawn

2460
02:16:03,180 --> 02:16:05,860
ELIZA:
Well I'm going back to sleep

2461
02:16:07,480 --> 02:16:07,960
HAMILTON:
Hey

2462
02:16:09,540 --> 02:16:12,900
Best of wives and best of women

2463
02:16:19,360 --> 02:16:20,760
MALE COMPANY:
One two three four

2464
02:16:20,760 --> 02:16:23,160
FULL COMPANY:
Five six seven eight nine—

2465
02:16:23,160 --> 02:16:25,120
BURR:
There are ten things you need to know

2466
02:16:25,120 --> 02:16:25,720
COMPANY:
Number one!
BURR:
There are ten things you need to know

2467
02:16:25,720 --> 02:16:26,180
COMPANY:
Number one!

2468
02:16:26,180 --> 02:16:28,180
BURR:
We rowed across the Hudson at dawn

2469
02:16:28,180 --> 02:16:31,280
My friend, William P. Van Ness signed on as my—

2470
02:16:31,280 --> 02:16:31,500
BURR AND COMPANY:
Number two!
My friend, William P. Van Ness signed on as my—

2471
02:16:31,500 --> 02:16:32,160
BURR AND COMPANY:
Number two!

2472
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:34,440
BURR:
Hamilton arrived with his crew:

2473
02:16:34,440 --> 02:16:37,440
Nathaniel Pendleton and a doctor that he knew

2474
02:16:37,440 --> 02:16:38,200
COMPANY:
Number three!

2475
02:16:38,200 --> 02:16:40,460
BURR:
I watched Hamilton examine the terrain

2476
02:16:40,460 --> 02:16:46,840
I wish I could tell you what was happ’ning in his brain
This man has poisoned my political pursuits!

2477
02:16:46,840 --> 02:16:49,680
COMPANY:
Most disputes die and no one shoots!

2478
02:16:49,680 --> 02:16:50,700
Number four!

2479
02:16:50,780 --> 02:16:53,020
BURR:
Hamilton drew first position

2480
02:16:53,020 --> 02:16:59,100
Looking, to the world, like a man on a mission
This is a soldier with a marksman’s ability

2481
02:16:59,100 --> 02:17:02,100
The doctor turned around so he could have deniability

2482
02:17:02,420 --> 02:17:03,080
COMPANY:
Five!

2483
02:17:03,080 --> 02:17:05,460
BURR:
Now I didn’t know this at the time
But we were—

2484
02:17:05,460 --> 02:17:08,540
BURR, PHILIP AND HAMILTON:
Near the same spot
Your/My son died, is that why -

2485
02:17:08,540 --> 02:17:08,560
COMPANY:
Six!
BURR, PHILIP AND HAMILTON:
Near the same spot
Your/My son died, is that why -

2486
02:17:08,560 --> 02:17:09,060
COMPANY:
Six!

2487
02:17:09,060 --> 02:17:11,600
BURR:
He examined his gun with such rigor?

2488
02:17:11,600 --> 02:17:14,440
I watched as he methodically fiddled with the trigger

2489
02:17:14,440 --> 02:17:15,380
COMPANY:
Seven!

2490
02:17:15,380 --> 02:17:17,340
BURR:
Confession time? Here’s what I got:

2491
02:17:17,340 --> 02:17:20,340
My fellow soldiers’ll tell you I’m a terrible shot

2492
02:17:20,340 --> 02:17:21,500
COMPANY:
Number eight!

2493
02:17:21,500 --> 02:17:23,660
MEN:
Your last chance to negotiate

2494
02:17:23,660 --> 02:17:27,200
Send in your seconds
See if they can set the record straight

2495
02:17:27,200 --> 02:17:29,880
BURR:
They won’t teach you this in your classes

2496
02:17:29,880 --> 02:17:33,120
But look it up, Hamilton was wearing his glasses

2497
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:39,120
Why? If not to take deadly aim?
It’s him or me, the world will never be the same

2498
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:45,120
I had only one thought before the slaughter:
This man will not make an orphan of my daughter

2499
02:17:45,140 --> 02:17:46,140
COMPANY:
Number nine!

2500
02:17:46,140 --> 02:17:48,440
BURR:
Look him in the eye, aim no higher

2501
02:17:48,440 --> 02:17:51,680
Summon all the courage you require
Then count:

2502
02:17:51,680 --> 02:17:55,120
COMPANY:
One two three four five six seven eight nine

2503
02:17:55,120 --> 02:17:56,660
Number ten paces! Fire!—

2504
02:17:59,200 --> 02:18:01,780
HAMILTON:
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory

2505
02:18:02,260 --> 02:18:06,680
Is this where it gets me
On my feet, sev’ral feet ahead of me?

2506
02:18:06,680 --> 02:18:10,840
I see it coming
Do I run or fire my gun or let it be?

2507
02:18:11,800 --> 02:18:13,880
There is no beat, no melody

2508
02:18:14,640 --> 02:18:20,300
Burr, my first friend, my enemy
Maybe the last face I ever see

2509
02:18:20,720 --> 02:18:25,180
If I throw away my shot
Is this how you’ll remember me?

2510
02:18:26,340 --> 02:18:28,020
What if this bullet is my legacy?

2511
02:18:28,020 --> 02:18:28,920
Legacy.

2512
02:18:29,840 --> 02:18:31,260
What is a legacy?

2513
02:18:31,800 --> 02:18:34,880
It’s planting seeds in a garden you never get to see

2514
02:18:35,300 --> 02:18:38,680
I wrote some notes
At the beginning of a song someone will sing for me

2515
02:18:38,680 --> 02:18:44,420
America, you great unfinished symphony
You sent for me, you let me make a difference

2516
02:18:44,420 --> 02:18:48,160
A place where even orphan immigrants
Can leave their fingerprints and rise up

2517
02:18:48,160 --> 02:18:50,680
I’m running out of time.
I’m running, and my time’s up

2518
02:18:50,680 --> 02:18:52,840
Wise up! Eyes up!

2519
02:18:53,720 --> 02:18:58,780
I catch a glimpse of the other side
Laurens leads a soldiers’ chorus on the other side

2520
02:18:58,780 --> 02:19:02,580
My son is on the other side
He’s with my mother on the other side

2521
02:19:02,580 --> 02:19:07,260
Washington is watching from the other side
Teach me how to say goodbye

2522
02:19:07,260 --> 02:19:10,200
Rise up, rise up, rise up!

2523
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:11,740
Eliza

2524
02:19:13,900 --> 02:19:15,680
My love, take your time

2525
02:19:16,800 --> 02:19:18,820
I’ll see you on the other side

2526
02:19:21,420 --> 02:19:24,380
Raise a glass to freedom...

2527
02:19:24,380 --> 02:19:26,120
BURR AND COMPANY:
He aims his pistol at the sky—

2528
02:19:26,120 --> 02:19:26,820
BURR:
Wait!

2529
02:19:31,340 --> 02:19:33,120
I strike him right between his ribs

2530
02:19:36,600 --> 02:19:39,460
I walk towards him, but I am ushered away

2531
02:19:43,220 --> 02:19:45,520
They row him back across the Hudson

2532
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:50,400
I get a drink

2533
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:59,120
I hear wailing in the streets

2534
02:20:01,100 --> 02:20:04,860
Somebody tells me, “You’d better hide.”

2535
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:07,780
They say

2536
02:20:07,780 --> 02:20:10,780
BURR AND ANGELICA:
Angelica and Eliza—

2537
02:20:12,380 --> 02:20:14,980
BURR:
Were both at his side when he died

2538
02:20:15,540 --> 02:20:19,620
Death doesn’t discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints

2539
02:20:19,620 --> 02:20:22,060
It takes and it takes and it takes

2540
02:20:22,060 --> 02:20:25,880
History obliterates
In every picture it paints

2541
02:20:25,880 --> 02:20:28,620
It paints me and all my mistakes

2542
02:20:28,620 --> 02:20:34,480
When Alexander aimed at the sky
He may have been the first one to die

2543
02:20:34,480 --> 02:20:36,920
But I’m the one who paid for it

2544
02:20:38,140 --> 02:20:41,060
I survived, but I paid for it

2545
02:20:43,660 --> 02:20:47,700
Now I’m the villain in your history

2546
02:20:49,720 --> 02:20:54,580
I was too young and blind to see...

2547
02:20:55,660 --> 02:20:59,540
I should’ve known
I should’ve known

2548
02:20:59,540 --> 02:21:05,980
The world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me

2549
02:21:07,320 --> 02:21:16,040
The world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me

2550
02:21:24,080 --> 02:21:27,020
WASHINGTON:
Let me tell you what I wish I’d known

2551
02:21:27,020 --> 02:21:32,580
When I was young and dreamed of glory
You have no control

2552
02:21:32,580 --> 02:21:36,320
Who lives, who dies
Who tells your story?

2553
02:21:36,320 --> 02:21:37,360
BURR:
President Jefferson:

2554
02:21:37,360 --> 02:21:38,620
JEFFERSON:
I’ll give him this

2555
02:21:38,620 --> 02:21:43,100
His financial system is a work of genius.
I couldn’t undo it if I tried

2556
02:21:44,040 --> 02:21:45,180
And I tried

2557
02:21:46,220 --> 02:21:49,340
COMPANY:
Who lives, who dies
Who tells your story?

2558
02:21:49,400 --> 02:21:50,460
BURR:
President Madison:

2559
02:21:50,460 --> 02:21:53,460
MADISON:
He took our country from bankruptcy to prosperity

2560
02:21:53,900 --> 02:21:58,340
I hate to admit it, but he doesn’t get enough credit
For all the credit he gave us

2561
02:21:58,340 --> 02:22:02,360
