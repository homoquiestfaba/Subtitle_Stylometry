1
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:19,534
Good mornin'.

2
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:24,271
What you got? Let me see this.

3
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:26,840
Oh. Whoosh.

4
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:30,944
Yeah. What's that? Boop boop.

5
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,152
What do you think?

6
00:03:38,687 --> 00:03:40,522
Wah!

7
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,067
What's that necklace for?

8
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,724
-Hello!
-Good morning, Meme.

9
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,391
Morning, Jamie.

10
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:21,228
Ah!

11
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:24,131
You hand over that baby to me
right this minute.

12
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:26,300
-Who's that?
-Who's my heart?

13
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:27,635
Who's that?

14
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:29,002
-Aww.
-Oh.

15
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:32,106
That's it, come to Meme.

16
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,248
Thank you for doing this, Meme.

17
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:46,487
Aww aww.

18
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:49,758
That's a grumpy baby.

19
00:04:49,824 --> 00:04:52,393
Oh! One more goodbye, yeah?

20
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,262
You gonna stay
with Meme today, yeah?

21
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:56,831
Yeah.

22
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:59,199
Be good. Be a good girl.

23
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,469
You all right
staying the night?

24
00:05:02,537 --> 00:05:05,406
Aww... oh! 'Course, darlin'.

25
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:08,643
Nothing would make me happier.

26
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,344
Oh, my!

27
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:13,347
-Papas leavin'.
-I'll be back today.

28
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:15,949
Daddy will be back.
He'll be back.

29
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,085
-Thank you, Meme.
-He'll be back.

30
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:03,725
All right, so there I was.

31
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,293
Day two, in the sandbox.

32
00:07:06,728 --> 00:07:08,763
In a convoy, on the 81st.

33
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,765
I'm sittin' up top,
at the gunner seat.

34
00:07:10,832 --> 00:07:13,200
Fucking hearts beating
through my chest 'cause I...

35
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:16,036
I heard it's the most dangerous
stretch of road in the country.

36
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,672
Fuck yeah, it is.

37
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:19,239
What could go wrong?

38
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,375
So we're cruising along.

39
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,311
All of a sudden,
I see this fucking Hajji
on the side of the road.

40
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:26,280
And he's going to town

41
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,348
-on a fuckin donkey--
-He's got--

42
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:31,218
Hang on a minute!
A fucking donkey?

43
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,186
Bro, he's got
his little Hajji dress

44
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:35,890
hiked up over his shoulders
bangin' away.

45
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:39,393
-How do you even do that?
-Super fucking weird, right?

46
00:07:41,663 --> 00:07:44,966
I even said somethin' to Gunny
about it but he shrugs it off.

47
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:47,835
So we don't get another
six klicks down the road,

48
00:07:47,902 --> 00:07:51,371
I see another fucking Alibaba
off in the distance

49
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:54,542
ridin' one of his own
behind this broken down Humvee.

50
00:07:54,609 --> 00:07:57,579
What, like another donkey
in the butthole?

51
00:07:57,645 --> 00:08:00,180
So what happened next?

52
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:01,583
More of the same.
I must've seen like

53
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:03,250
fuckin' four more pairs of 'em.

54
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:06,554
Gettin' after it on the way back
to the farm. right?

55
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:08,088
What?

56
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,457
So... uh...

57
00:08:10,525 --> 00:08:12,527
It gets worse.
All right, so we get back

58
00:08:12,594 --> 00:08:15,597
to the motor pool
and I see this old dirty bastard

59
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:17,665
about yay high,
with a wooden leg

60
00:08:17,732 --> 00:08:22,269
sittin' on the hood
of the major's Humvee,
jerkin' off.

61
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,605
-You're kidding.
-What?

62
00:08:23,972 --> 00:08:26,040
-Yeah--
-How the fuck do you
even get in there?

63
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:29,677
So Gunny looks up to me,
can see how fuckin' rattled
I am, right?

64
00:08:29,744 --> 00:08:32,947
Then he asks me what
my malfunction is.
I mean, my malfunction,

65
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:34,716
I'm telling you, the whole
fucking way here I'm seeing

66
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:37,484
dudes bangin' donkeys
on the side of the road.

67
00:08:37,552 --> 00:08:39,386
There's this guy
with a wooden leg

68
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:41,856
beatin' off in the motor pool
in broad daylight

69
00:08:41,923 --> 00:08:43,357
and you know what he says to me?

70
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,892
What'd he say?

71
00:08:46,728 --> 00:08:50,430
"Marine, you can't expect a guy
with a wooden leg

72
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:52,132
to catch a fucking donkey."

73
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,434
Crazy motherfucker.

74
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,537
Jesus Christ.

75
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:57,772
We here.

76
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:02,342
What's your problem?
Why you poutin'?

77
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,344
Bitch, I ain't fuckin' poutin'.

78
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:07,749
-Yeah, you are.
-Fuck you.

79
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,184
Let's rock and roll.

80
00:09:21,596 --> 00:09:23,898
I know the transfer took
a little bit longer
than we wanted,

81
00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:25,533
but we appreciate your business

82
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,568
<i>and</i> we appreciate your trust.

83
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:30,370
Everybody freeze!
Don't you fuckin' move!

84
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,674
- Hands away from
the weapons, all.

85
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,274
-Nah nah nah nah nah.
-Think it through.

86
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:35,710
Everybody fuckin' relax.

87
00:09:35,777 --> 00:09:37,845
You heard him.
Don't fuckin' move.

88
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:41,348
-Stop!
-Shut up!

89
00:09:43,685 --> 00:09:46,521
All right, you heard the man.

90
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,656
Let's start with
you three ladies right there.

91
00:09:48,723 --> 00:09:51,458
Hands laced on top of your head.
Back away from the counter.

92
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,630
Let's go.
Get against the fucking wall.
Everyone else, on the floor!

93
00:09:55,697 --> 00:09:58,265
Eyes on the fucking floor, pal.

94
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,835
Get on the floor, bitch!

95
00:10:00,902 --> 00:10:03,705
-Whoa!
-Guys, just relax! All right?

96
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:07,775
Heads down. Eyes down.
This ain't worth dying for.

97
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,546
Give me the fucking key.

98
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:15,983
Give me the fucking key!

99
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,618
Smart!

100
00:10:30,865 --> 00:10:33,101
No no no no no!

101
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:34,702
-Ah ah!
-Oh, God! Oh, my--!

102
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:37,839
-Ah!
-Shut the fuck up,
or your fucking thumb's next.

103
00:10:42,677 --> 00:10:44,377
Let's go. I need the code.

104
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:47,414
Ah! Three, 17, 77.

105
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:03,865
Look at my fucking eyes,
if that's a panic code...

106
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:07,869
he's gonna cut off a lot more
than your fucking thumb.

107
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:09,704
You understand me?

108
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:15,743
One, 23, seven, nine.

109
00:11:16,077 --> 00:11:18,646
You, motha--

110
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,883
Shut the fuck up!

111
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:24,451
We're in!

112
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:27,955
- Uh-uh-uh.
- Whoa!

113
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:54,314
Bro, we're out of clock.

114
00:12:31,285 --> 00:12:33,353

115
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:35,355

116
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:49,337

117
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:50,938

Motherfuck!

128
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:36,043
Move back! Move--

129
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,545
Moving.

00:20:43,043 --> 00:20:45,012
<i>with fully automatic weapons.</i>

181
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,381
<i>Notified J.P., Saint Bernard,</i>

182
00:20:47,448 --> 00:20:49,283
<i>Saint Tammany,</i>
<i>and State Police.</i>

183
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:52,152
<i>Requesting shutdown</i>
<i>of all routes out of the city.</i>

184
00:20:52,219 --> 00:20:54,488
<i>including the Crescent City</i>
<i>Connection,</i>

185
00:20:54,556 --> 00:20:57,925
<i>Causeway, the Twin Span,</i>
<i>and all routes headed</i>
<i>westbound.</i>

186
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:13,173
-Gonna say nothing?
-What you want me to say?

187
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,175
What the fuck was that?

188
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,545
FBI robbery task force.

189
00:21:17,612 --> 00:21:18,946
No shit.

190
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,650
-How'd they know?
-Someone ratted us.

191
00:21:24,385 --> 00:21:25,687
Who?

192
00:21:26,855 --> 00:21:29,890
We gotta wash this money.
Make sure our exit's
not burning,

193
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:31,693
and get the fuck out.
Fast.

194
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,628
Where we gonna run?

195
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:36,330
This is gonna
make national news, Mick.

196
00:21:36,397 --> 00:21:37,965
We're fucking cop killers now.

197
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:40,000
The choice is what?
You hear anybody yell,

198
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:42,102
"Don't move, you're under
arrest"? No, you didn't.

199
00:21:43,203 --> 00:21:44,873
They were there
to fucking murder us,

200
00:21:44,938 --> 00:21:46,641
and I ain't got no regrets.

201
00:21:48,142 --> 00:21:50,512
We left, fucking,
three of our brothers

202
00:21:50,578 --> 00:21:52,246
in the fucking street!

203
00:21:56,183 --> 00:21:58,085
They made their choices.

204
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:31,853
Two, I've already given
my statement to your paid men.

205
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,788
-Gentlemen!
-You're probably not--

206
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:35,523
Pace.

207
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:39,861
So you're the one in charge
of this shit show.

208
00:22:39,928 --> 00:22:41,395
That's Special Agent
Frank Ross.

209
00:22:41,462 --> 00:22:43,531
Where the fuck were you,
Special Agent?

210
00:22:43,598 --> 00:22:45,934
I just got off a plane from
D.C. ten minutes ago.

211
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:48,536
I've got six dead officers
and another one in critical

212
00:22:48,603 --> 00:22:51,238
because of your team's
cowboy shit.

213
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:55,008
I understand, Lieutenant.
I do.

214
00:22:55,075 --> 00:22:56,711
It went bad
and we're here.

215
00:22:56,778 --> 00:22:58,111
We've gotta move past that now,

216
00:22:58,178 --> 00:23:00,214
so we can focus
on catching these guys.

217
00:23:00,481 --> 00:23:04,051
"Catch 'em."
It's New Orleans, Special Agent.

218
00:23:04,117 --> 00:23:06,621
We're gonna bury
these motherfuckers.

219
00:23:07,354 --> 00:23:10,859
Do your thing,
but don't go fucking shit
on my crime scene.

220
00:23:11,358 --> 00:23:13,962
Remember,
this is homicide first,
robbery second.

221
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:18,065
I understand you're upset.
Emotional.

222
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:21,468
You have every reason to be...

223
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:25,707
But if you ever sling
foul language at me again,

224
00:23:25,773 --> 00:23:27,742
it will be your last.

225
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,277
Understand?

226
00:23:36,784 --> 00:23:39,253
So, where we at on lockdown?

227
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:42,222
In motion, boss.
Mayor's given us the keys.

228
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:43,825
There are checkpoints
everywhere.

229
00:23:43,892 --> 00:23:45,927
, the causeway,
all the ports,

230
00:23:45,994 --> 00:23:47,461
highways, bridges, roads

231
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:49,096
-heading out the city.
-Marinas?

232
00:23:49,162 --> 00:23:50,632
Yes, sir. Everything.

233
00:23:50,698 --> 00:23:52,232
All right, all right.

234
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:56,103
I want C.R.T. teams
and every precinct standing by.

235
00:23:57,037 --> 00:24:00,675
-So, what exactly happened?
-I got a call from my buddy
in Vice.

236
00:24:00,742 --> 00:24:03,778
Said he hooked a guy yesterday,
on some sort of statutory shit.

237
00:24:03,845 --> 00:24:05,780
Some nobody, Edwin Smalls.

238
00:24:05,847 --> 00:24:09,216
That cyber security geek is
looking at five to seven years
in Angola.

239
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:10,885
Folded like a lawn-chair.

240
00:24:11,218 --> 00:24:12,854
They literally called us
ten minutes

241
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:14,354
before the crew hit the place.

242
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:15,890
I tried to phone you,
but I couldn't reach you.

243
00:24:15,957 --> 00:24:17,692
So... I made the call.

244
00:24:18,593 --> 00:24:21,428
So, tell me why we couldn't
take 'em at the van.

245
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,932
Well, the block car
was in motion,

246
00:24:23,998 --> 00:24:25,299
and we were pushin' up.

247
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,802
Crew came out heavy
like before, five and a driver.

248
00:24:27,902 --> 00:24:31,271
Body armor, ballistics, masks,
all automatic stuff...

249
00:24:31,338 --> 00:24:32,907
And then, fender bender

250
00:24:32,974 --> 00:24:35,009
right in front of us,
as we were moving in.

251
00:24:35,075 --> 00:24:37,311
Boris Karloff over there,
at the front door,

252
00:24:37,377 --> 00:24:39,413
came up on his sights.

253
00:24:39,981 --> 00:24:42,316
I beat him to the punch.
It was on.

254
00:24:42,717 --> 00:24:44,919
Nico took out the driver
of the van.

255
00:24:44,986 --> 00:24:47,822
Swat got the mummy over there
at the dumpster.

256
00:24:47,989 --> 00:24:51,191
So, I hear you winged a fourth.
You sure you hit him?

257
00:24:51,258 --> 00:24:53,561
Oh, I hit meat.
I heard the man howl.

258
00:24:53,628 --> 00:24:55,462
And, I tell ya,
there ain't no way he makes it

259
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:58,198
through the night without
some serious medical attention.

260
00:24:58,265 --> 00:25:00,635
These guys are smart,
they're way too ruthless.

261
00:25:00,702 --> 00:25:04,438
Find out if there are any
doctors who've come up missing.

262
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:08,308
Look into... vet offices,
plastic surgeons,

263
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:09,911
anyone who can handle trauma.

264
00:25:09,978 --> 00:25:11,411
On it.

265
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:14,616
You know how you've been saying
you thought these guys
were ex-military.

266
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:17,284
-Yeah
-Yeah, well, you're right.

267
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:19,119
We had them pinned down.

268
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:21,055
and guess what those assholes
go and do?

269
00:25:21,121 --> 00:25:23,256
-Attack the ambush.
-Exactly.

270
00:25:23,323 --> 00:25:25,459
Wasn't till they realized
they were boxed in

271
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:27,061
that they started to fall back.

272
00:25:27,361 --> 00:25:29,363
And the ranger peeled
all the way down the fence
and out.

273
00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:31,899
-Ranger peel?
-Yeah.

274
00:25:31,966 --> 00:25:35,670
Move, moving, covering,
all at high speed shit.

275
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:40,074
I gotta tell you,
I haven't seen that live
since Somalia.

276
00:25:40,908 --> 00:25:45,847
-Go on.
-They jacked some kid
for his station wagon.

277
00:25:45,913 --> 00:25:47,381
Mark unit ran him down,

278
00:25:47,447 --> 00:25:48,883
but that just turned
into an ambush.

279
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:52,219
at the switch car,
'bout, uh, six blocks over.

280
00:25:52,587 --> 00:25:57,157
All right. Get eyes out.
We're looking for something big.

281
00:25:57,224 --> 00:25:59,326
You know, something that
can carry all of them,

282
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:00,795
something with power.

283
00:26:00,962 --> 00:26:03,263
We're talkin' a large SUV,
three-by-three, one ton.

284
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,932
-Copy that.
-Yeah.

285
00:26:08,435 --> 00:26:10,437
Tell me about this van.

286
00:26:11,371 --> 00:26:14,274
Stole it. Three days,
out of Chalmette.

287
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,582
-Nico
-Yes, sir.

288
00:26:23,017 --> 00:26:24,619
Who do we have over here?

289
00:26:24,686 --> 00:26:28,556
Bank tellers, managers
en route to University Medical.

290
00:26:28,623 --> 00:26:31,458
Heard he put up a fight,
and they tuned him up
pretty good.

291
00:26:31,526 --> 00:26:34,227
-Pssh... Not smart.
-No, sir.

292
00:26:37,098 --> 00:26:39,067
Hi. Now,
just one moment.

293
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:42,570
Detective, do you mind
if I ask your witnesses
a couple questions?

294
00:26:42,637 --> 00:26:46,574
Seriously? I got a kid I was
supposed to pick up hours ago.

295
00:26:46,974 --> 00:26:50,410
-Go for it. I'm done.
-Thank you. Ladies...

296
00:26:50,477 --> 00:26:52,613
My name is Special Agent
Frank Ross.

297
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:57,185
-Look... we just wanna go home.
-I understand. I do.

298
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,154
I just need
a moment of your time.

299
00:27:00,588 --> 00:27:02,824
Do you remember anything...

300
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:07,360
Anything specific about
the gunman who did this?

301
00:27:09,864 --> 00:27:12,900
-Two of 'em were Y'at.
-Y'at?

302
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:14,769
I'm sorry, I'm sorry -I don't
know what a Y'at is--

303
00:27:14,836 --> 00:27:16,971
Metro locals. That Brooklyn
accent that you think

304
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:18,639
you've been hearing around town?

305
00:27:18,706 --> 00:27:21,308
It ain't. That's a thing
we call Y'at.

306
00:27:21,374 --> 00:27:25,113
Okay. All right. Uh...
Which ones were Y'ats?

307
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:26,948
The vampire and wolf.

308
00:27:27,014 --> 00:27:29,917
Okay. Thank you, thank you.
That's very, very helpful.

309
00:27:29,984 --> 00:27:31,052
Thank you very much.

310
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:33,621
Ma'am, what about you?

311
00:27:33,688 --> 00:27:37,357
Did you see anything?
Do you remember anything?

312
00:27:38,226 --> 00:27:39,727
Ma'am?

313
00:27:40,293 --> 00:27:44,565
Guns. All I saw was guns.

314
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:49,336
I mainly just kept my head down.
I didn't wanna...

315
00:27:49,402 --> 00:27:51,072
make eye contact.

316
00:27:52,006 --> 00:27:55,910
That was smart.
That was very smart.

317
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:58,713
Okay, just breathe...
It's okay.

318
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,281
You're gonna be okay.

319
00:28:05,219 --> 00:28:07,354
Ex... excuse me, one moment.

320
00:28:13,326 --> 00:28:17,064
<i>Dad, where are you?</i>
<i>I've been waiting forever.</i>

321
00:28:17,131 --> 00:28:18,633
<i>You're not coming, are you?</i>

322
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:21,202
<i>Tomorrow morning</i>
<i>Works always first, right?</i>

323
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:23,905
<i>-I should've known--</i>
-Frank, I just got word...

324
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:26,073
car fire on Chapitoulas.

325
00:28:38,351 --> 00:28:40,555
Ladies...
Thank you, thank you.

326
00:28:40,621 --> 00:28:43,858
Please don't hesitate to call
Detective here,

327
00:28:43,925 --> 00:28:47,028
if you remember
anything at all. Okay?

328
00:28:47,762 --> 00:28:50,865
All right?
Thank you all again.

329
00:28:51,766 --> 00:28:54,367
-Thanks, Agent Ross.
-Yeah.

330
00:28:56,403 --> 00:29:00,440
Get their details.
Run 'em all through local,
state, NCIC...

331
00:29:00,508 --> 00:29:02,710
-Will do.
-You drive.

332
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:20,862
-Who the f--
-Yo, Bill, open the door man.

333
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:23,197
-Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
Bro...
-Yo, open the door, Bill.

334
00:29:23,264 --> 00:29:26,234
Whoa whoa whoa!
You can't bring him in here!

335
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:28,870
Jeremy, this ain't how it works!

336
00:29:30,104 --> 00:29:31,639
Tell me, motherfucker,
how's it work?

337
00:29:31,706 --> 00:29:33,274
How's it fucking work?

338
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,375
- Thought you'd rat us out,
didn't you?

339
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:37,912
-Open your eyes,
I want you to see this.
-Hey, no no no.

340
00:29:37,979 --> 00:29:40,815
Come on,
he's as fucked as we are.
No no no, he fucking knew.

341
00:29:40,882 --> 00:29:43,251
He fucking knew.
You're the only one
who fuckin' knew.

342
00:29:43,317 --> 00:29:46,419
No, wrong.
Smalls knew.

343
00:29:46,486 --> 00:29:49,156
What?

344
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:52,994
When it hit the news,
I knew-- I made a call.

345
00:29:54,494 --> 00:29:56,898
-NOPD picked him up
yesterday.

346
00:29:56,964 --> 00:29:59,333
Fuck.

347
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:03,237
-We need another way out.
-Smalls didn't know
nothing about it.

348
00:30:03,304 --> 00:30:05,206
We don't know what the fuck he
knew, what he told him...

349
00:30:05,273 --> 00:30:08,776
-Hey, we need to wash
that shit ASAP.
-No can do.

350
00:30:08,843 --> 00:30:11,579
My guy's out.
Too much blood on it.

351
00:30:11,646 --> 00:30:13,881
-Blue blood.
-Oh, fuck that, fuck that.

352
00:30:13,948 --> 00:30:15,415
Tell him we'll give him
another bu--

353
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:16,651
Tell him we'll give him
ten percent.

354
00:30:16,717 --> 00:30:17,985
He's out!

355
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:20,755
I don't care if you give him
100 percent!

356
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:22,189
Jamie...

357
00:30:22,256 --> 00:30:23,758
It's too much heat.

358
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:25,492
There's fucking
cash in a bag, right?

359
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:27,995
Nobody's gonna fucking
clean that for us?

360
00:30:28,062 --> 00:30:29,797
Yeah...

361
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:33,901
The one guy I can dig up
that might be able to

362
00:30:33,968 --> 00:30:38,105
move that much weight...

363
00:30:38,272 --> 00:30:39,340
That's Nussy.

364
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:44,211
And, boys,
the hit won't be light,

365
00:30:44,879 --> 00:30:49,984
Cause he's gonna take,
forty, fifty percent...
minimum.

366
00:30:51,652 --> 00:30:53,621
I mean, it is what it is, right?

367
00:30:57,558 --> 00:30:59,961
Fuck it. Make the fucking call.

368
00:31:00,027 --> 00:31:01,595
Yes, sir.

369
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:06,400
Put your fucking guns down.
What the fuck!

370
00:31:06,466 --> 00:31:07,969
-Here we go-
Pearl, right?

371
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:10,371
-What the fuck are you doin'?
-Fuck... you!

372
00:31:11,138 --> 00:31:13,007
You piece of shit.
You fucking coward.

373
00:31:13,074 --> 00:31:15,009
-Handle your business,
little bro--
-You fucking scum!

374
00:31:15,076 --> 00:31:16,744
I ain't got fucking time
for this--

375
00:31:16,911 --> 00:31:18,512
Fuck, you promised me, Jamie,
shit. You promised me--

376
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:20,047
Get the fuck out of here.

377
00:31:20,114 --> 00:31:23,317
I'm gonna fucking kill you.
I'm gonna kill you.

378
00:31:23,384 --> 00:31:25,319
What are you doin'?!

379
00:31:25,786 --> 00:31:29,056
That psycho motherfucker
just killed us.

380
00:31:29,123 --> 00:31:30,992
Fuck! What was I thinking,
Jamie?

381
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:33,027
We should've known better!
We should've known better.

382
00:31:33,094 --> 00:31:34,562
- Fuck, Jamie!
- Hey.

383
00:31:34,628 --> 00:31:37,398
Joan! Joan!
The surgery was paid for.

384
00:31:37,465 --> 00:31:40,468
-Jamie, we had everything.
Jamie, everything is gone now.
-Shh... shh.

385
00:31:40,534 --> 00:31:43,503
-Stop.
-What... what?

386
00:31:43,637 --> 00:31:47,274
- What?
- Come here.

387
00:31:53,447 --> 00:31:58,019
Listen. Hey... We're gonna
get through this, okay?

388
00:31:58,085 --> 00:32:00,121
All right?

389
00:32:01,055 --> 00:32:01,856
How?

390
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:03,758
How? How do we get through this?

391
00:32:03,824 --> 00:32:04,992
I'm workin' on it.

392
00:32:05,126 --> 00:32:07,895
All right?
But you can't be here!

393
00:32:07,962 --> 00:32:10,664
We had a plan. You go home.

394
00:32:10,731 --> 00:32:12,299
You act like
everything is normal.

395
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:16,003
You can't be around these guys,
all right?

396
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:22,543
You need to listen to me.
The FBI's on you.

397
00:32:26,547 --> 00:32:27,782
They talk to you?

398
00:32:28,115 --> 00:32:31,419
Yeah, yeah. They were at
the bank for, like, hours.

399
00:32:31,485 --> 00:32:32,787
They talked to everybody.

400
00:32:32,853 --> 00:32:36,123
They're looking for guys
from the neighborhood.

401
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,861
They're gonna find you, Jamie.
And... and...

402
00:32:40,928 --> 00:32:42,730
Listen... what if we just left.

403
00:32:43,097 --> 00:32:45,866
-What if we left right now...
and you came with me right now?
-Hey... Shh--

404
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:47,334
-And we go get Joannie--
-Stop! Stop!

405
00:32:47,401 --> 00:32:49,303
And we get the fuck out of here.
You come with me...

406
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,405
There's one thing
that's important. You go home.

407
00:32:51,472 --> 00:32:53,574
That's it.
Let me work!

408
00:32:53,874 --> 00:32:55,876
All right?
You trust me?

409
00:32:55,943 --> 00:32:57,645
You know I do.

410
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,449
I can't have this.
You gotta get him out of here.

411
00:33:01,516 --> 00:33:03,150
Shut the door! Shut the door!

412
00:33:03,217 --> 00:33:04,351
Jamie, he's gotta go!

413
00:33:04,418 --> 00:33:05,953
Where the fuck
am I gonna take him, Bill?

414
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,289
Let's take him to Clarence.

415
00:33:08,355 --> 00:33:10,191
We ain't takin' him
to fucking Clarence's.

416
00:33:10,257 --> 00:33:12,226
Dump him at the E.R.
and hope for the best.

417
00:33:12,293 --> 00:33:14,728
-Take him to--
-Take him to fucking Clarence.

418
00:33:14,795 --> 00:33:16,197
I'm coming with.

419
00:33:16,263 --> 00:33:17,731
-What?
-Yeah.

420
00:33:17,932 --> 00:33:20,101
No you're fucking going home.
We just talked about this.

421
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:23,704
I ain't leavin' you here
with this fucking psychopath.

422
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:28,742
-Ava.
-No way! I'm not going home!

423
00:33:30,044 --> 00:33:31,812
You know what?
That's a great idea.

424
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:34,583
Cops ain't looking
for no pretty brunette
from the Channel.

425
00:33:34,648 --> 00:33:36,784
Here! You drive!

426
00:33:43,891 --> 00:33:46,894
I'm not leaving your side
till this is over with.

427
00:33:47,995 --> 00:33:51,999
You fuck us...and I will be back
to murder you where you stand.

428
00:33:52,066 --> 00:33:53,067
We clear?

429
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:56,637
We're clear.

430
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,543
<i>The surviving assailants</i>

431
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:02,977

454
00:34:55,963 --> 00:34:58,332
Got some fool on the line

455
00:34:58,899 --> 00:35:01,202
Told me to tell ya,
he's willing to chat.

456
00:35:09,009 --> 00:35:11,580
The Jet,
what you want?

457
00:35:11,646 --> 00:35:14,481
<i>Some</i> <i>arriving, still unaware.
</i> <i>of whether their loved ones</i>

458
00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:16,217
Yeah, I'm lookin' at that shit
right now.

459
00:35:16,551 --> 00:35:19,720
These some straight up
mad motherfuckers,
right here.

460
00:35:21,055 --> 00:35:24,258
Oh, yeah? Enlighten me.

461
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:46,146
It's a good location
to dump a car.

462
00:35:46,213 --> 00:35:48,249
You got 90 only seconds away,

463
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:51,051
and the Irish Channel
to get lost in, right there.

464
00:35:52,286 --> 00:35:54,088
So, what's next?

465
00:35:55,356 --> 00:35:57,958
We flex this. Okay?

466
00:35:58,025 --> 00:35:59,093
So what do we know?

467
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:00,928
Three shooters. One's hurtin'.

468
00:36:00,995 --> 00:36:03,197
Two of 'em are
probably local boys.

469
00:36:03,264 --> 00:36:04,465
All ex-military.

470
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:07,702
Not just military...
these guys are gunfighters.

471
00:36:07,768 --> 00:36:11,071
We're lookin' for vets
with trigger time
in the sandbox.

472
00:36:11,138 --> 00:36:12,674
I'll get Jean
to reach out to DOD.

473
00:36:12,741 --> 00:36:15,543
-And I'll pull Jefferson
and Orleans' barrage.
-Good.

474
00:36:16,944 --> 00:36:18,546
So what exactly was the take?

475
00:36:18,613 --> 00:36:21,583
Walked out with three mil,
got away with one point five.

476
00:36:22,883 --> 00:36:25,687
What was a bank in East Calhoun
doing with that much cash?

477
00:36:25,754 --> 00:36:27,555
They just took over
the temp headquarters branch,

478
00:36:27,622 --> 00:36:30,558
because the CBD location
was going through a remodel.

479
00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:33,294
And today's Thursday.

480
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:36,797
So, they were carrying
heavy prepping' for distribution

481
00:36:36,864 --> 00:36:38,165
to all the other branches.

482
00:36:38,232 --> 00:36:40,467
Cover all those
Friday payroll checks.

483
00:36:40,735 --> 00:36:42,403
And, how do they know all this?

484
00:36:42,469 --> 00:36:44,171
That's our job.

485
00:36:45,939 --> 00:36:48,576
You mentioned earlier,
an Edwin Smalls...

486
00:36:48,643 --> 00:36:50,477
That's right. The rat.

487
00:36:50,545 --> 00:36:52,913
Smalls gave them intel
and boards.

488
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,214
What kind of boards?

489
00:36:54,281 --> 00:36:55,816
Some high-end, custom stuff,

490
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:57,686
designed to trigger
the alarm system

491
00:36:57,851 --> 00:37:00,588
-to shut itself off 15 minutes
before the crew hit the place.
-Okay.

492
00:37:00,655 --> 00:37:03,424
I followed up on that
with the bank's security firm.

493
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:06,695
They told me that they found
two odd, custom boards

494
00:37:06,761 --> 00:37:08,563
installed in the master CPU.

495
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:12,066
They're polygraphing
the entire staff as we speak.

496
00:37:13,367 --> 00:37:16,303
So if Smalls hadn't talked,
they'd have gotten away clean?

497
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,871
Hundred percent.

498
00:37:18,707 --> 00:37:19,907
Hmm...

499
00:37:20,374 --> 00:37:22,644
I wanna speak to this nobody.

500
00:37:22,711 --> 00:37:25,179
This Mr. Edwin Smalls.

501
00:37:50,237 --> 00:37:53,675
Holy shit.
Get the fuck out of here.

502
00:37:54,074 --> 00:37:56,443
We need you.

503
00:37:56,511 --> 00:37:57,746
I got you. Come on!

504
00:37:57,812 --> 00:38:00,548
Get the hell in here! Quick!
Put him over here.

505
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,719
Put him over here.
Put him over here.

506
00:38:04,786 --> 00:38:05,953
Sorry 'bout the mess, man.

507
00:38:06,086 --> 00:38:07,287
I was about to
clean this shit up.

508
00:38:07,354 --> 00:38:09,323
Put him right here.

509
00:38:18,132 --> 00:38:21,335
- Bullet hit him
under his armpit.

510
00:38:21,402 --> 00:38:25,272
-His right armpit.
-His other right armpit,
Clarence!

511
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:27,742
-Where the fucking blood is!
-Would you just chill out, man?!

512
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:30,177
You got me so fucking rattled,
I can't even think straight!

513
00:38:30,244 --> 00:38:32,781
I got this.
Just let me do my thing!

514
00:38:32,847 --> 00:38:34,682
Clarence! Who's that?

515
00:38:34,749 --> 00:38:37,719
- Who the fuck is that?
- Who you got in there?

516
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:42,122
Ma! It's the pie guy.
He's just droppin' off a
pepperoni.

517
00:38:42,189 --> 00:38:43,725
But I hate pepperoni!

518
00:38:43,792 --> 00:38:47,060
Yeah, I know!
It's not for you! It's for me.

519
00:38:47,127 --> 00:38:49,463
You said you didn't want any.

520
00:38:49,531 --> 00:38:53,300
-That ain't no pie guy!
-Mom, just relax, okay?

521
00:38:53,367 --> 00:38:55,335
I'll be there in a bit
to rub your feet.

522
00:38:55,402 --> 00:38:57,739
- Really?
- I promise, Ma!

523
00:38:57,806 --> 00:39:01,810
Just watch your program,
and I'll be in there
before it's over.

524
00:39:06,046 --> 00:39:10,017
-Yo, what the fuck
are you doin'?
-I--I--I need my bag.

525
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:12,720
-What bag?
-It's a medical bag.

526
00:39:12,787 --> 00:39:14,421
It's green. It's about this big.

527
00:39:21,328 --> 00:39:23,932
-This it?
-That's it. Toss it here.

528
00:39:23,997 --> 00:39:26,233
Now, everybody
just give me my space,

529
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,135
and let me do my thing.

530
00:39:34,676 --> 00:39:36,477
-It's Bill.
-Take it. I got it.

531
00:39:36,544 --> 00:39:39,079
-You got this?
-Yeah, I got it. Go go go go go.

532
00:39:39,146 --> 00:39:41,448
Hey, what's up?

533
00:39:42,917 --> 00:39:44,451
What you got?

534
00:39:44,985 --> 00:39:49,423
He's down, but it's a shit deal.

535
00:39:49,924 --> 00:39:51,258
<i>Thirty cents on the dollar.</i>

536
00:39:51,325 --> 00:39:52,927
Fuck, that's seventy percent.

537
00:39:52,993 --> 00:39:59,032
<i>I know, but it's one of those</i>
<i>take-it-or-leave-it situations.</i>

538
00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:02,570
<i>Your call.</i>

539
00:40:08,041 --> 00:40:11,111
-All right.
<i>-How's the bleeding?</i>

540
00:40:11,178 --> 00:40:14,448
Not good.
So how we gonna do this?

541
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:21,021
This dude has lost
a shit ton of blood.

542
00:40:21,856 --> 00:40:23,390
My guess is the bullet
bounced off his shoulders,

543
00:40:23,457 --> 00:40:25,158
start gettin' down
to his stomach.

544
00:40:26,026 --> 00:40:28,428
His abdomen is distended,
and he's got a G.I. bleed.

545
00:40:28,495 --> 00:40:30,030
I ain't got time for this, Bro.

546
00:40:30,097 --> 00:40:31,633
Well, I don't know
what to tell you, bro!

547
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:33,635
I'm a corpsman, man,
not a surgeon.

548
00:40:33,701 --> 00:40:37,137
Without real trauma care,
and even then-- I don't know!

549
00:40:37,204 --> 00:40:39,774
Ain't gonna happen,
can't happen.

550
00:40:50,518 --> 00:40:53,186
You make it go easy for him.

551
00:40:57,725 --> 00:40:58,826
Take it!

552
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:08,536
What's goin' on?

553
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:11,438
Yeah, it's all good.
I--I did my thing.

554
00:41:11,505 --> 00:41:14,107
And, uh, he's in rough shape,
but the bleeding stopped.

555
00:41:14,174 --> 00:41:16,410
He just needs some time to rest.

556
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:18,111
Well, we ain't got time
for no rest.

557
00:41:18,178 --> 00:41:19,847
You gotta get him fixed up,
ASAP.

558
00:41:19,914 --> 00:41:21,649
Get him over to Bill's house.
He can rest when we get there.

559
00:41:21,716 --> 00:41:24,484
-What's Bill have to say?
-Got a deal.

560
00:41:24,552 --> 00:41:27,321
-Twenty minutes
and we will know. You hear me?
-Yeah.

561
00:41:27,387 --> 00:41:29,591
-Let's move. Let's go.
-Yeah.

562
00:41:32,092 --> 00:41:33,460
Hey...

563
00:41:35,128 --> 00:41:36,430
Thank you.

564
00:41:37,632 --> 00:41:40,535
-Yeah, man.
-Take care of him.

565
00:42:11,866 --> 00:42:14,602
Look... as soon as
we're done with this,

566
00:42:14,669 --> 00:42:16,604
I'm gonna drop you off
at St. Charles.

567
00:42:16,671 --> 00:42:18,740
You're gonna
take the street car home.

568
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:21,174
When are you comin' home?

569
00:42:25,013 --> 00:42:26,581
I don't know.

570
00:42:29,316 --> 00:42:32,520
-So this is it?
-No, it's not it.

571
00:42:32,587 --> 00:42:34,956
All right? As soon as
the heat dies down,

572
00:42:35,023 --> 00:42:37,157
I'mma send for you and Joan.

573
00:42:41,495 --> 00:42:43,296
Jamie...

574
00:42:45,332 --> 00:42:48,301
You ain't never gonna
send for us.

575
00:42:50,104 --> 00:42:53,541
If you make it out of this,
and that's--that's a big if...

576
00:42:54,642 --> 00:42:56,343
You're gonna be running
for the rest of your life.

577
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,478
I got a plan.

578
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,883
-What plan?
-Bolivia--

579
00:43:03,117 --> 00:43:04,519
-Let me explain--
-Bolivia?

580
00:43:04,786 --> 00:43:06,821
-Listen to me. Listen to me.
-Jamie, I don't even know--

581
00:43:06,888 --> 00:43:09,524
-I don't even know,
where the fuck that is, Jamie--
-Listen--

582
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:13,761
It's in South America,
and there's this big lake
down there,

583
00:43:13,828 --> 00:43:18,566
Massive.
Right on the Bolivian,
Peruvian line.

584
00:43:18,633 --> 00:43:20,233
Right there on the border,

585
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,302
surrounded
by the Andes Mountains.

586
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:24,906
And, in the middle of
this big lake,

587
00:43:24,972 --> 00:43:28,943
there's this little island
called Isla de Sol.

588
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:31,411
There's no cars,
no roads,

589
00:43:31,478 --> 00:43:34,347
Just fishermen and farmers.

590
00:43:35,917 --> 00:43:39,386
All right? You, me, and Joan
could start a life there.

591
00:43:43,157 --> 00:43:45,693
Just the three of us together?

592
00:43:48,596 --> 00:43:50,397
Jamie...

593
00:43:53,601 --> 00:43:55,937
-I love you.
-I love you.

594
00:43:56,871 --> 00:43:59,707
-And I'd go anywhere with you.
-Yeah.

595
00:44:13,521 --> 00:44:15,255
You gonna leave him behind?

596
00:44:25,166 --> 00:44:26,500
Sup?

597
00:44:35,275 --> 00:44:36,611
Fuck it.

598
00:44:36,677 --> 00:44:38,679
Let's go get our fucking money,
come on.

599
00:44:59,834 --> 00:45:02,637
-You Brill?
-Who the fuck are you?

600
00:45:04,539 --> 00:45:06,207
I'm nobody.

601
00:45:06,274 --> 00:45:07,942
Funny,
I was just thinking that.

602
00:45:08,009 --> 00:45:10,778
Yo, let's just fucking do
this, 'aight?

603
00:45:11,311 --> 00:45:13,014
Check this shit out.

604
00:45:23,423 --> 00:45:25,726
-Good, brother?
-Yeah, we good.

605
00:45:25,993 --> 00:45:27,929
Yo, homie. You, uh...

606
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:31,098
you're a little light,
don't you think?

607
00:45:31,498 --> 00:45:33,835
How do you figure?
That's five hundred K.

608
00:45:35,536 --> 00:45:38,405
- I'm sure it is.
- That's thirty percent.

609
00:45:38,471 --> 00:45:41,609
-Yes, it is.
-Yo, that's what we agreed to.

610
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:44,745
What the fuck did you just say?

611
00:45:44,812 --> 00:45:46,647
It's the only fucking deal
on the table.

612
00:45:46,714 --> 00:45:47,949
We didn't have no choice.

613
00:45:48,381 --> 00:45:50,251
What, you didn't think you need
to run that by me first?

614
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:51,652
Do we have a problem?

615
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:53,554
Yeah, we got a fucking
problem, hold on.

616
00:45:53,754 --> 00:45:56,724
If you about that action,
just say the word.

617
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:58,726
Yo, we're good!

618
00:45:58,793 --> 00:46:01,028
Aight?
Everybody, just calm down.

619
00:46:06,968 --> 00:46:08,703
You the smart White boy,

620
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:11,105
best get your bitch in line--

621
00:46:11,172 --> 00:46:13,140
What the fuck did
you just say?

622
00:46:13,207 --> 00:46:15,643
You heard what the fuck I said!

623
00:46:16,611 --> 00:46:20,047
Yeah, fuck 'em.
Come on.

624
00:46:23,184 --> 00:46:25,887
All right, okay, All right.

625
00:46:26,754 --> 00:46:29,190
No, you're right,
it is what it is,

626
00:46:29,257 --> 00:46:31,391
I apologize.

627
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,375
Hey... you...

628
00:46:52,747 --> 00:46:55,583
Come on, you're gonna
miss the best part.

629
00:46:59,153 --> 00:47:01,589
Yup. There you go.

630
00:47:01,923 --> 00:47:04,091
What the fuck!

631
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,576
Go, go, go, go!

632
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:34,221
Oh, God.

633
00:47:34,288 --> 00:47:37,058
I knew it. I fucking knew it.

634
00:47:39,727 --> 00:47:42,964
Oh, shit!
All right. Get down.

635
00:47:49,337 --> 00:47:52,173
All right.
Don't do anything stupid.

636
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,176
Yo, be cool. Mick.

637
00:48:11,892 --> 00:48:14,494
Six, thirty six, C.
Drop it to me.

638
00:48:49,163 --> 00:48:54,835
Yo, Nussy. Boss.
I don't know how
to tell you this.

639
00:48:54,902 --> 00:48:58,039
-Tell me what?
-The meet went ugly.

640
00:48:58,105 --> 00:48:59,740
<i>Brill's gone.</i>

641
00:49:00,241 --> 00:49:01,409
What you mean "gone"?

642
00:49:01,475 --> 00:49:04,278
Gone. White boys executed him.

643
00:49:04,345 --> 00:49:06,213
<i>Knocked off everyone.</i>

644
00:49:08,215 --> 00:49:10,718
Nah. Not everyone.

645
00:49:11,786 --> 00:49:15,589
Nussy. Yo! Wait!
Let me explain.

646
00:49:16,357 --> 00:49:17,792
Nah, I can't hear nothin'.

647
00:49:17,858 --> 00:49:21,262
What?! 'How bout now?

648
00:49:21,328 --> 00:49:22,897
Nah, still nothin'.

649
00:49:22,963 --> 00:49:25,534
Wait, what? I don't get it.

650
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,003
'Cause if I could hear you,
you'd be an apparition.

651
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:30,571
A what?

652
00:49:31,338 --> 00:49:33,474
A fucking ghost, nigga.

653
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:36,911
If I could hear you,
you'd be a motherfucking ghost.

654
00:49:36,977 --> 00:49:38,513
At least that's what
you're gonna be

655
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:39,880
when Stitches
delivers you to me.

656
00:49:40,047 --> 00:49:42,950
So I can feed you
to the fucking alligators.

657
00:49:43,384 --> 00:49:45,052
<i>Bitch ass nigger.</i>

658
00:49:48,255 --> 00:49:49,558
You heard that?

659
00:49:49,623 --> 00:49:51,125
Yes, sir.

660
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:19,353
Look man, I'm tellin' you,
I ain't wanna help him.

661
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:21,989
Not one damn bit.
But I had no choice.

662
00:50:22,056 --> 00:50:25,259
-He put a fucking Glock
to my head.
-A glock?

663
00:50:25,926 --> 00:50:28,229
Yes, sir. Saw it written
right on the side.

664
00:50:28,295 --> 00:50:31,165
Had a shiny pearl handle grip.
It--

665
00:50:31,232 --> 00:50:34,635
Oh, yeah?
Did it have any engraving in it?

666
00:50:34,702 --> 00:50:37,004
You know on that...
shiny pearl handle.

667
00:50:37,071 --> 00:50:38,906
Yes, sir. Yeah, it did.

668
00:50:38,973 --> 00:50:41,375
Had a grim reaper
carved in on it.

669
00:50:41,442 --> 00:50:42,710
Really?

670
00:50:42,776 --> 00:50:45,279
That sound like something
you lie about?

671
00:50:45,346 --> 00:50:46,647
Then, they put the gun

672
00:50:46,747 --> 00:50:48,249
in my mouth,
and pulled back the handle.

673
00:50:48,315 --> 00:50:49,917
Wait, they put it in your mouth?

674
00:50:49,984 --> 00:50:51,520
I thought you said
they put in to your head.

675
00:50:51,586 --> 00:50:54,488
Look, he put it to my head,
then in my mouth.

676
00:50:54,556 --> 00:50:57,258
All right? Then the crazy
son of a bitches start arguing

677
00:50:57,324 --> 00:50:59,026
about which one's
gonna get to pull the trigger.

678
00:50:59,093 --> 00:51:00,661
-Holy shit!
-Mmm!

679
00:51:00,794 --> 00:51:02,263
Put it in your mouth,
and pulled it out...

680
00:51:02,329 --> 00:51:04,599
Man, I swear for God,
can you believe that shit?

681
00:51:04,665 --> 00:51:06,066
No.

682
00:51:07,902 --> 00:51:09,403
No, I don't.

683
00:51:12,139 --> 00:51:13,340
Who are you?

684
00:51:17,811 --> 00:51:19,947
You ever heard
of the Pinocchio effect?

685
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:24,118
The pokey no fect?

686
00:51:24,685 --> 00:51:27,154
No, no.

687
00:51:27,855 --> 00:51:29,323
Pinocchio.

688
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:33,528
You know, the cute wooden puppet
that wished he was a real boy?

689
00:51:33,928 --> 00:51:36,430
Every time he told a lie,
his nose would grow.

690
00:51:36,497 --> 00:51:38,065
Man, I told you.
I swear for God.

691
00:51:38,132 --> 00:51:40,167
What do I have to gain
from lying to you?

692
00:51:40,234 --> 00:51:42,571
You see, Edwin...
Mind I call you Edwin?

693
00:51:42,637 --> 00:51:43,771
You see...

694
00:51:44,138 --> 00:51:47,908
The Pinocchio effect is
when someone's lying,

695
00:51:47,975 --> 00:51:49,210
they know they're lying

696
00:51:49,343 --> 00:51:51,212
So they're working
as hard as they can

697
00:51:51,278 --> 00:51:53,447
to convince you,
that they ain't.

698
00:51:53,781 --> 00:51:56,050
They start babbling,
and going on...

699
00:51:56,116 --> 00:51:59,521
Start spitting out more details,
more words, than necessary.

700
00:51:59,588 --> 00:52:01,088
You know, shit like,

701
00:52:01,155 --> 00:52:03,592
'Do you think I'd lie
about something like that?'

702
00:52:04,091 --> 00:52:06,327
Or, 'What do I have to gain,
lying to you all?'

703
00:52:06,393 --> 00:52:07,696
Whoa.

704
00:52:08,095 --> 00:52:10,532
Wait... what do you think
I'm lying about?

705
00:52:11,031 --> 00:52:12,601
Everything.

706
00:52:13,367 --> 00:52:17,905
For one, a Glock's
a polymer pistol. It's plastic.

707
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,007
You can't add grips to it.

708
00:52:20,074 --> 00:52:22,343
Especially no pearl handle ones.

709
00:52:23,043 --> 00:52:26,780
And, second, it's a striker
fire, hammerless--

710
00:52:26,847 --> 00:52:30,017
Which means there's no hammer
to pull pack on, dumbass.

711
00:52:32,286 --> 00:52:33,821
What the fuck is wrong with you,

712
00:52:33,988 --> 00:52:35,523
you about to have a stroke
or something?

713
00:52:37,424 --> 00:52:39,827
I have neither the time
nor the crayons

714
00:52:39,893 --> 00:52:41,596
to explain all this to you.

715
00:52:42,062 --> 00:52:44,298
But, I'm gonna give it a go,
anyway.

716
00:52:45,634 --> 00:52:47,034
What you're unaware of is,

717
00:52:47,101 --> 00:52:49,436
earlier this afternoon,

718
00:52:49,503 --> 00:52:50,938
those crazy sons of bitches,

719
00:52:51,005 --> 00:52:53,841
that you supplied the intel
and the boards to,

720
00:52:53,907 --> 00:52:56,243
pulled a North Hollywood
shootout.

721
00:52:56,910 --> 00:53:01,448
They murdered six officers
and put another
in critical condition.

722
00:53:01,882 --> 00:53:05,019
Which makes you an accessory to,
at minimum...

723
00:53:05,085 --> 00:53:07,888
Six counts of capital murder.

724
00:53:10,592 --> 00:53:14,061
Now, you're realizing
the gravity of your situation.

725
00:53:14,128 --> 00:53:18,265
All right, look. I had no
fucking idea, all right?

726
00:53:18,332 --> 00:53:20,134
They were supposed to go in
on the prowl.

727
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,670
Break in the night before.

728
00:53:21,736 --> 00:53:23,437
Look, I had no idea
they were gonna kill no one,

729
00:53:23,504 --> 00:53:25,973
-all right?
-I'm sure the state of Louisiana

730
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,475
would really appreciate
that explanation.

731
00:53:31,845 --> 00:53:33,648
Oh, fuck me.

732
00:53:33,715 --> 00:53:36,317
Yeah, yeah, that's about right.

733
00:53:38,852 --> 00:53:40,789
All right, look, look...

734
00:53:40,854 --> 00:53:42,089
What can I do, all right?

735
00:53:42,156 --> 00:53:43,824
Tell me, tell me...
What can I do?

736
00:53:43,891 --> 00:53:45,926
Tell me 'bout your customers.

737
00:53:45,993 --> 00:53:48,630
These guys that put you
in this hole.

738
00:53:48,697 --> 00:53:52,299
Okay, it was, uh,
two White dudes.

739
00:53:52,366 --> 00:53:53,967
I think they might've
been brothers.

740
00:53:54,034 --> 00:53:55,637
How'd you come
to that conclusion?

741
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:57,772
They kept calling each other
bro and shit.

742
00:53:57,871 --> 00:53:59,506
What are you, fucking Redman?
Who do you know in this city

743
00:53:59,574 --> 00:54:00,775
who doesn't call each other bro?

744
00:54:00,941 --> 00:54:02,376
It was different than that,
all right?

745
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:04,144
Look I just-- I feel like
they were brothers. All right?

746
00:54:04,211 --> 00:54:06,246
-They kind of looked alike.
-Okay, okay.

747
00:54:06,313 --> 00:54:09,617
This is good. Tell me more
about these brothers.

748
00:54:09,684 --> 00:54:14,288
All right, uh, they, uh...
The younger one
was the smart one.

749
00:54:14,789 --> 00:54:19,059
Okay? And--and...
The older one was the mean one.

750
00:54:19,126 --> 00:54:21,095
What made the smarter one
smart?

751
00:54:21,161 --> 00:54:23,230
He was just--
all about business.

752
00:54:23,297 --> 00:54:24,932
He wanted
to know the details.

753
00:54:24,998 --> 00:54:26,668
Very specific about the details.

754
00:54:26,735 --> 00:54:28,168
And the mean one?

755
00:54:29,571 --> 00:54:31,138
Oh, oh, he was bad news.

756
00:54:33,907 --> 00:54:36,176
You know, some wild eyes.

757
00:54:36,243 --> 00:54:38,912
He's the type of guy
that's lookin' for any excuse

758
00:54:38,979 --> 00:54:41,949
to hurt someone.
All right? He told me,

759
00:54:42,015 --> 00:54:44,084
if I ratted on him,
he'd find me,

760
00:54:44,151 --> 00:54:46,420
and leave me twitchin'
in my own pile of shit.

761
00:54:46,487 --> 00:54:49,123
And... he was...
very, very specific

762
00:54:49,189 --> 00:54:50,891
about the pile of shit.

763
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:53,961
Okay. I believe you.
Keep going.

764
00:54:54,027 --> 00:54:56,029
Okay... uh...

765
00:54:58,198 --> 00:55:02,336
The smart one
had a Saint Jude pendant
around his neck.

766
00:55:02,704 --> 00:55:04,004
And, uh...

767
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:09,276
the mean one had a...
Marine corps tattoo.

768
00:55:09,343 --> 00:55:13,414
It said Semper Fi,
it had writin' on it.

769
00:55:13,947 --> 00:55:15,583
What did the tattoo say?

770
00:55:18,118 --> 00:55:20,688
It said Semper Fi somethin'
on the bottom,

771
00:55:20,755 --> 00:55:23,023
-And, then, Sheridan somethin',
on top.
-Say what?

772
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:26,326
-It said Semper Fi
on the bottom.
-No no no... the name

773
00:55:26,393 --> 00:55:29,096
Oh, uh, Sheridan Raid,
or something.

774
00:55:29,163 --> 00:55:31,298
I remember 'cause of the tank.
Okay?

775
00:55:31,666 --> 00:55:34,001
-That mean somethin' to you?
-One second--

776
00:55:34,067 --> 00:55:37,104
So, should I have lawyer here,
or something?

777
00:55:37,605 --> 00:55:39,674
Norma, look,
I need you to drop everything,

778
00:55:39,741 --> 00:55:41,275
and run two names for me.

779
00:55:43,944 --> 00:55:46,346
Listen. I understand how
and why you built the boards.

780
00:55:46,413 --> 00:55:49,483
But, how did you know about
the Thursday deposits?

781
00:55:50,284 --> 00:55:52,119
How did you know that branch
was temping

782
00:55:52,186 --> 00:55:53,755
as a headquarter branch?

783
00:55:53,822 --> 00:55:56,056
Look, I don't know nothing
about no headquarter branch

784
00:55:56,123 --> 00:55:58,192
and no Thursday deposit either.

785
00:55:58,258 --> 00:56:00,662
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, send me that, right now.

786
00:56:04,632 --> 00:56:07,468
-This them?
-Yeah yeah yeah.
Fuck yeah, that's them.

787
00:56:07,535 --> 00:56:10,471
Look, that's the mean one,
and that's the smart one.

788
00:56:17,244 --> 00:56:19,848
Hey, what's that mean,
what about... what about me?

789
00:56:20,214 --> 00:56:22,015
Man, what the fuck, man,
we good?

790
00:56:22,851 --> 00:56:25,452
Michael "Mick" Sheridan
and Jamie "James" Sheridan.

791
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,120
Irish White trash
from the Channel.

792
00:56:27,187 --> 00:56:28,623
I popped Mick and his
younger brother years ago

793
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:30,491
in an agg assault,
they damn near killed a guy.

794
00:56:30,558 --> 00:56:32,527
The brother walked,
but Mick got sent off to Angola

795
00:56:32,594 --> 00:56:33,695
for seven years.

796
00:56:33,761 --> 00:56:35,362
Both are ex-Marines
from the sandbox.

797
00:56:35,429 --> 00:56:37,565
All right, get a bulletin
to all of our agencies.

798
00:56:37,632 --> 00:56:40,400
-And get these photos
to the media ASAP.
-Copy.

799
00:56:40,467 --> 00:56:42,302
-Any word on the bank employees?
-Not yet.

800
00:56:42,369 --> 00:56:43,872
I'll rattle
Jean's cage again, though.

801
00:56:43,938 --> 00:56:45,506
Follow up now.

802
00:56:53,581 --> 00:56:55,817
-What happened?
-Mick happened.

803
00:56:55,884 --> 00:56:57,652
That's what the fuck happened.

804
00:57:00,722 --> 00:57:02,524
What is she talkin' about?

805
00:57:04,224 --> 00:57:06,961
And, Jamie...
Why do you have all the money?

806
00:57:07,027 --> 00:57:09,764
We had to move.
We had to dump it.

807
00:57:10,999 --> 00:57:13,233
Do you have any idea
who that was?

808
00:57:14,201 --> 00:57:18,171
That was Brill Waynes,
Nussy's brother.

809
00:57:18,238 --> 00:57:20,008
- Nussy...
- We are so dead.

810
00:57:20,073 --> 00:57:21,843
It's okay. We're fine.

811
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:23,410
Yo, we're better than fine.

812
00:57:23,477 --> 00:57:26,079
Everybody's share
just got a serious fucking bump.

813
00:57:26,146 --> 00:57:27,849
Where we at with the island?

814
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:31,118
Hey, the passports,
where we at?

815
00:57:31,184 --> 00:57:32,386
What's the matter?

816
00:57:32,452 --> 00:57:33,721
You're not gonna be happy

817
00:57:33,788 --> 00:57:35,657
till we're all dead,
anyway, right?

818
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:38,760
- What?
- Look, I get it.

819
00:57:38,826 --> 00:57:42,630
Mick, you've always wanted
a warrior's death.

820
00:57:44,566 --> 00:57:46,601
I ain't afraid of dying, bro.

821
00:57:46,668 --> 00:57:49,537
Yeah, no, no,
we all know.

822
00:57:51,371 --> 00:57:56,143
If we do get out of this,
we go our separate ways.

823
00:57:57,579 --> 00:58:00,080
We're never
gonna see each other again.

824
00:58:02,249 --> 00:58:04,686
- Bro.
- Don't bro me.

825
00:58:04,953 --> 00:58:07,354
You ain't thinkin' straight.

826
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:11,693
I've never been more clear
in my whole life.

827
00:58:12,359 --> 00:58:14,127
Every pile of shit
I've ever stepped in

828
00:58:14,194 --> 00:58:15,495
is because of you, Mick.

829
00:58:24,906 --> 00:58:26,708
Who got you the money for Joan?

830
00:58:30,612 --> 00:58:33,313
Who got you outta
hell in Providence?

831
00:58:41,388 --> 00:58:44,525
How many beatings
I took for you from our old man?

832
00:58:47,895 --> 00:58:49,296
You owe me.

833
00:58:53,067 --> 00:58:54,301
No.

834
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:59,574
After tonight, the debt's paid.

835
00:59:00,474 --> 00:59:03,745
Hey... Hey!
I'm your fucking brother!

836
00:59:04,712 --> 00:59:06,814
What, that don't mean
nothin' to you?

837
00:59:11,919 --> 00:59:13,721
This is about her, right?

838
00:59:15,623 --> 00:59:18,593
You gonna let that fucking bitch
come between us?

839
00:59:28,402 --> 00:59:29,871
Say that again.

840
00:59:31,304 --> 00:59:33,708
What? Bitch?

841
00:59:46,186 --> 00:59:48,623
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Bro!

842
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:51,893
Stitches, baby!
I was just about to call you!

843
00:59:58,465 --> 01:00:01,035
<i>Two local men have been</i>
<i>identified as shooters</i>

844
01:00:01,102 --> 01:00:03,037
<i>in today's brutal bank robbery.</i>

<i>Both own extensive rap sheets.</i>

01:00:11,746 --> 01:00:14,314
<i>Both men are former</i>

All right, so I just
got off the line with Jean.

854
01:00:32,466 --> 01:00:33,935
Something did pop.

855
01:00:34,001 --> 01:00:36,403
One of those bank tellers,
that pretty brunette?

856
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:40,340
Ava Rishoto,
she grew up in Irish Channel

857
01:00:41,142 --> 01:00:42,977
Now, she only had
a couple of dings

858
01:00:43,044 --> 01:00:44,311
in her sealed juvie record.

859
01:00:44,377 --> 01:00:46,714
-Such as?
-Petty theft at 13,

860
01:00:46,781 --> 01:00:48,082
and a P.I. at 15.

861
01:00:49,117 --> 01:00:51,686
Eh, there's more.
I told you Jean was digging.

862
01:00:51,753 --> 01:00:53,955
So he pulls the bank accounts
on all of 'em.

863
01:00:54,021 --> 01:00:56,791
And she's got over
75 grand in deposits.

864
01:00:56,858 --> 01:00:58,893
Three weeks after they
pulled that job in Metairie.

865
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,662
-So, you followed the money?
-All digital.

866
01:01:01,729 --> 01:01:04,699
Something called, uh,
Secret Angels.

867
01:01:04,766 --> 01:01:06,500
It's one of those
anonymous sites

868
01:01:06,567 --> 01:01:08,236
where you
crowdfund sad stories.

869
01:01:08,301 --> 01:01:11,371
Now, all the money did go
to pay the hospital bills.

870
01:01:11,438 --> 01:01:13,641
And nothing else
looks suspicious.

871
01:01:13,708 --> 01:01:16,077
She's still carrying her house
and her car note.
But...

872
01:01:16,144 --> 01:01:18,880
those dates matchin' up
like that, that just...

873
01:01:18,946 --> 01:01:21,549
-makes for one hell
of a coincidence.
-Hey, Givens!

874
01:01:21,616 --> 01:01:23,383
-What you workin'?
-You ain't heard?

875
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:25,186
- Heard what?
- Narcotics on the scene.

876
01:01:25,253 --> 01:01:27,688
They've got six baggers
on the ground in Central City.

877
01:01:27,755 --> 01:01:29,690
-Look's like it's Nussy's group.
-How do you figure?

878
01:01:29,757 --> 01:01:31,159
Your boy Brill is one of 'em.

879
01:01:31,225 --> 01:01:32,660
When'd this happen?

880
01:01:32,727 --> 01:01:35,029
Shit, the bodies
ain't even cold yet.

881
01:01:35,096 --> 01:01:36,564
I gotta roll.

882
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:40,333
What's a Brill?

883
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,669
Only the little brother

884
01:01:41,736 --> 01:01:43,403
to the biggest gangsta
in the wards.

885
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:45,072
- Really?
- Yeah.

886
01:01:45,173 --> 01:01:47,775
Big enough gangsta
to wash one point five mil?

887
01:01:47,842 --> 01:01:49,677
He'll definitely
be on the list.

888
01:01:49,744 --> 01:01:51,078
Where can we find this Nussy?

889
01:01:51,145 --> 01:01:53,114
Well, he's got a club
over on Magazine.

890
01:01:53,181 --> 01:01:54,549
Show me.

891
01:02:08,262 --> 01:02:09,530
Jamie.

892
01:02:16,904 --> 01:02:20,274
Jamie...
Jamie!

893
01:02:20,541 --> 01:02:24,846
- Jamie!
- Yo, yo! Okay.

894
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:28,249
-Hey...
-Jamie!

895
01:02:28,316 --> 01:02:30,651
- You okay?
- Jamie.

896
01:02:31,719 --> 01:02:35,990
Bro?
Hey, yo, yo, you good?

897
01:02:37,124 --> 01:02:38,659
You okay?

898
01:02:40,161 --> 01:02:42,697
Jamie, fucking,
I'm so fucking sorry, bro.

899
01:02:46,433 --> 01:02:49,537
Bro.
I'm so fucking sorry.

900
01:02:51,272 --> 01:02:52,673
I got this, bro. I do.

901
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:54,342
I'm--I'm gonna tell 'em
it was me.

902
01:02:54,407 --> 01:02:57,511
You just ain't gettin' it, man.
No matter what you say,

903
01:02:57,578 --> 01:03:00,848
they're just gonna kill us,
anyway.

904
01:03:05,887 --> 01:03:07,088
Ava!

905
01:03:08,356 --> 01:03:09,991
Hey...

906
01:03:11,726 --> 01:03:15,830
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

907
01:03:34,916 --> 01:03:38,920
Hey, bro.
It wasn't them.
It was me.

908
01:03:39,486 --> 01:03:41,622
It was all me.

909
01:03:43,157 --> 01:03:44,525
Is that right?

910
01:03:47,094 --> 01:03:49,964
Hey,
there's more money than this,

911
01:03:50,031 --> 01:03:51,732
A lot more money.

912
01:03:51,799 --> 01:03:53,301
Oh, yeah?

913
01:03:53,701 --> 01:03:56,037
Yeah. Just let her go.

914
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:05,680
-Yeah, this one?
-Yeah, even trade.

915
01:04:05,746 --> 01:04:08,816
-Hey, hey--
-Come on, man--

916
01:04:08,883 --> 01:04:09,884
Hey!

917
01:04:09,951 --> 01:04:12,353
Even fuckin' trade, man.
A million cash,

918
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:15,856
I stashed it.

919
01:04:17,591 --> 01:04:19,527
No, it ain't gonna happen.

920
01:04:19,593 --> 01:04:20,761
Come on, what the fuck's
wrong with you?

921
01:04:20,828 --> 01:04:22,430
-It's a million dollars.
-No, it ain't.

922
01:04:23,097 --> 01:04:25,498
Brill already
told me what you left him.

923
01:04:26,634 --> 01:04:29,036
That's all you got right there.

924
01:04:29,537 --> 01:04:31,672
Plus, my boy Stitches
over there...

925
01:04:31,739 --> 01:04:34,108
that motherfucker

926
01:04:34,175 --> 01:04:36,310
got somethin' wicked
for her ass.

927
01:04:38,412 --> 01:04:40,514
Hold on, princess.

928
01:04:44,819 --> 01:04:46,787
Hey, yo, motherfucker,

929
01:04:49,023 --> 01:04:54,195
it was me that dumped
your little bitch ass brother.

930
01:04:56,964 --> 01:04:59,600
Oh, yeah.
You should've heard him.

931
01:05:00,601 --> 01:05:02,803
Begged me. Whimpered.

932
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:06,007
Cried like
a little fucking bitch.

933
01:05:07,274 --> 01:05:10,277
Until I jammed
that .45 in his mouth.

934
01:05:13,647 --> 01:05:15,016
Hey, yo, homie.

935
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:18,586
You know anything
about the terminal effects

936
01:05:18,652 --> 01:05:20,521
of contact shots?

937
01:05:22,957 --> 01:05:26,660
No?
That's a big word.

938
01:05:27,228 --> 01:05:28,596
You see,

939
01:05:28,662 --> 01:05:31,699
with the terminal
effects of contact shots,

940
01:05:31,766 --> 01:05:36,170
the body body absorbs
all the discharge
from the round.

941
01:05:36,904 --> 01:05:38,839
Not just the fucking bullet.

942
01:05:40,574 --> 01:05:42,209
All those gasses...

943
01:05:42,276 --> 01:05:44,278
expanding that fucking fast?

944
01:05:44,345 --> 01:05:45,813
Whoo!

945
01:05:46,213 --> 01:05:49,617
That's some savage,
ugly shit, bro.

946
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:54,422
You gotta trust me on this one.

947
01:05:54,488 --> 01:05:56,690
Your little brother Brill...

948
01:05:58,392 --> 01:06:00,828
That's gonna be a closed casket.

949
01:06:17,912 --> 01:06:21,015
Well, I smell
the vapors of hell on you, boy.

950
01:06:22,349 --> 01:06:27,788
You good,
but you're not gonna play me.

951
01:06:28,589 --> 01:06:32,626
No. I'm--I'mma savor the moment.

952
01:06:33,627 --> 01:06:36,697
Got plans for you.
Take my time.

953
01:06:37,364 --> 01:06:41,936
Make it a few nights, even.

954
01:06:43,572 --> 01:06:45,940
See that container over there?

955
01:06:47,542 --> 01:06:50,111
Know y'all been wondering
what that is, all night, huh?

956
01:06:51,011 --> 01:06:54,648
That's a hundred gallons
of sulfuric acid.

957
01:06:58,986 --> 01:07:04,024
Turn a man into soup in minutes.
Real wicked shit.

958
01:07:04,758 --> 01:07:07,261
Yeah, I got that
from my Mexican friends.

959
01:07:07,995 --> 01:07:10,664
They got it goin' on.

960
01:07:16,504 --> 01:07:17,905
Hey, yo, Stitches.

961
01:07:17,972 --> 01:07:20,708
Let's show these fools
a little demo real quick.

962
01:07:20,941 --> 01:07:23,010
Get their fucking mind right.

963
01:07:26,881 --> 01:07:29,618
I just want you to know
it's about to get real noisy
in here.

964
01:07:29,683 --> 01:07:31,819
Real noisy.

965
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:40,194
No no no no no no.
God, god, no, please.

966
01:07:40,261 --> 01:07:42,696
Wait, wait.
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

967
01:07:42,763 --> 01:07:44,599
-Jamie, stop him--
-Hey, hey, come on, man.

968
01:07:44,665 --> 01:07:46,734
Hey! Hey! There's more money--

969
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,002
-Jamie, stop him!
-Hey, look at me, man.

970
01:07:48,068 --> 01:07:49,403
There's more
fuckin' money, man.

971
01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:51,972
Jamie, stop him!
Jamie! Jamie!

972
01:07:52,039 --> 01:07:54,041
You don't have to do this!

973
01:07:54,509 --> 01:07:57,411
Ah! Ah! Ah!

974
01:07:58,179 --> 01:08:00,014
No! No, no!

975
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:03,050
No! Fuckin' no!

976
01:08:04,885 --> 01:08:07,589
-Ahh!
-Take that, motherfucker.

977
01:08:07,656 --> 01:08:09,490
Take it. Take it like a champ!

978
01:08:13,127 --> 01:08:15,462
You motherfucker!
I'm gonna fucking murder you!

979
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:18,499
That's what I'm talkin' bout!
Ooh-whee!

980
01:08:19,233 --> 01:08:20,935
- This how you get
a party started!

981
01:08:21,001 --> 01:08:23,837
You're gonna wish
you murdered me first.

982
01:08:28,008 --> 01:08:32,479
So the Jet tells me,
that ya'll are brothers.

983
01:08:34,114 --> 01:08:37,218
You the younger brother?
Am I wrong?

984
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,002
Hey, Stitches!

985
01:08:57,404 --> 01:08:58,806
Let me have a go at it.

986
01:09:08,516 --> 01:09:11,852
No, Mick, do something, Mick.
Do something.

987
01:09:11,919 --> 01:09:14,321
Hey, hey! No, no, no, no.

988
01:09:15,222 --> 01:09:20,160
No, don't do that!
No, no, no!

989
01:09:22,129 --> 01:09:24,633
This is what you wanted, huh?

990
01:09:24,699 --> 01:09:26,500
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

991
01:09:27,268 --> 01:09:28,737
Shut the fuck up!

992
01:09:28,802 --> 01:09:31,071
It's okay. It's okay.

993
01:09:46,521 --> 01:09:49,290
Ah! Ah!

994
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:18,952
Okay, okay, you--

995
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:36,470
Talk about deja fucking vu.

996
01:10:38,138 --> 01:10:39,708
Didn't I tell you,
you were gonna wish

997
01:10:39,774 --> 01:10:41,408
you killed me first?

998
01:10:42,777 --> 01:10:44,512
Don't you?

999
01:10:48,248 --> 01:10:50,484
-Oh, you're all right.
-Come on!

1000
01:11:23,884 --> 01:11:25,919
We're gonna celebrate.

1001
01:11:26,521 --> 01:11:27,888
What?

1002
01:11:28,322 --> 01:11:30,157
Take her, take her and go.

1003
01:11:31,058 --> 01:11:34,194
Go! Go! Go!

1004
01:11:41,335 --> 01:11:43,805
<i>All units,</i>
<i>we're receiving multiple calls</i>

1005
01:11:43,872 --> 01:11:46,006
<i>of 94s at 961 St. Mary Street.</i>

1006
01:11:46,073 --> 01:11:48,976
<i>Callers say,</i>
<i>it sounds like</i>
<i>automatic gunfire.</i>

1007
01:11:49,042 --> 01:11:51,713
-That's Nussy's place.
Ten minutes away.
-Let's go!

1008
01:12:14,168 --> 01:12:16,336
-Freeze!
-Do what he says.

1009
01:12:16,403 --> 01:12:19,072
Put the gun down. Put it down!

1010
01:12:19,139 --> 01:12:20,474
-Not even for me, not for me.
-Put the gun down.

1011
01:12:20,542 --> 01:12:21,975
Come on, man,
you don't want to do this!

1012
01:12:22,042 --> 01:12:24,478
-Think about Joan--
-Put it down.

1013
01:12:24,546 --> 01:12:26,380
-Think about Joan, Jamie.
-Don't be stupid!

1014
01:12:28,516 --> 01:12:29,584
Now!

1015
01:12:36,290 --> 01:12:38,593
That's it! Slowly!

1016
01:12:43,565 --> 01:12:45,834
Good. Now step back.

1017
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:49,036
Let me see your waistband.
Pull up your shirt.

1018
01:12:55,944 --> 01:12:57,478
Put 'em on the ground.

1019
01:13:15,597 --> 01:13:17,164
Kick 'em to me.

1020
01:13:22,469 --> 01:13:25,072
Ma'am, you back up,
till I say stop.

1021
01:13:25,138 --> 01:13:26,674
-Okay.
-Do what he says.

1022
01:13:26,741 --> 01:13:28,743
Back! Back!

1023
01:13:30,812 --> 01:13:31,980
-Stop!
-Uh, yes, sir.

1024
01:13:32,045 --> 01:13:33,715
You, to your knees!

1025
01:13:35,148 --> 01:13:36,784
To your knees!

1026
01:13:44,424 --> 01:13:48,028
- Six, 36, headquarters.
<i>- Six, 36, go ahead.</i>

1027
01:13:48,095 --> 01:13:51,265
I've got a White male.
I'm at the corner
of Laurel and Second Street.

1028
01:13:51,331 --> 01:13:53,233
<i>The subject matches</i>
<i>the description</i>
<i>of one of the shooters</i>

1029
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:54,936
<i>from the BOLO from the bank.</i>

1030
01:13:55,003 --> 01:13:57,539
-That's blocks away.
-Come on Nico,
just get us there.

1031
01:13:57,605 --> 01:13:59,506
Go, just go.

1032
01:14:03,611 --> 01:14:05,212
You're gonna fry
for what you did today,

1033
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:07,815
and I'm gonna
reserve a front row sea-

1034
01:14:08,181 --> 01:14:09,584
Wait!

1035
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:25,600
What the hell?
Why'd you do that, bro?

1036
01:14:26,935 --> 01:14:28,435
Cause I love you, bro.

1037
01:14:29,003 --> 01:14:32,707
Look at me, look at me, Jamie,
look at me! Hey, hey!

1038
01:14:33,407 --> 01:14:37,244
Take cover!

1039
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,985
Babe, we gotta go.
Come on, Jamie!

1040
01:14:44,052 --> 01:14:45,385
Come on!

1041
01:14:45,452 --> 01:14:47,220
Go. Let's go!

1042
01:14:50,424 --> 01:14:52,026
Runaways, shots fired,
suspect fleeing on foot.

1043
01:14:52,092 --> 01:14:53,360
1200 block.

1044
01:14:53,427 --> 01:14:55,495
Be advised, plainclothes
officers in pursuit.

1045
01:14:55,563 --> 01:14:57,031
Let's go!

1046
01:14:57,331 --> 01:15:00,068
FBI, six, 25.
Add us to the search.

1047
01:15:20,054 --> 01:15:23,156
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my--

1048
01:15:33,968 --> 01:15:36,169
Jamie...

1049
01:15:47,849 --> 01:15:49,751
Yeah. Come on.

1050
01:16:45,173 --> 01:16:47,407
Gonna make the block.

1051
01:17:14,267 --> 01:17:15,803
Back door!

1052
01:17:23,711 --> 01:17:25,546
Move! Move!

1053
01:17:56,778 --> 01:17:59,113
<i>I'm on Maura,</i>
<i>headed to Josephine,</i>

1054
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:01,015
<i>I'm almost on you guys.</i>

1055
01:18:01,082 --> 01:18:03,584
-Clear!
-Clear. Go go go!

1056
01:18:07,287 --> 01:18:09,056
To the gate!

1057
01:18:26,674 --> 01:18:30,410
What the fuck!
Get the fuck out of my house!

1058
01:18:34,582 --> 01:18:36,984
-FBI!
-Move, move! Stay down!

1059
01:19:08,381 --> 01:19:10,017
He's hit.

1060
01:19:10,084 --> 01:19:11,152
You got eyes on him?

1061
01:19:11,219 --> 01:19:13,821
-No, you?
-Negative.

1062
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:35,743
I got eyes on him!
Nico, ya'll go right!

1063
01:21:12,873 --> 01:21:14,375
He's gotta be here somewhere.

1064
01:21:14,442 --> 01:21:16,010
Gunshot can't be far.

1065
01:21:17,178 --> 01:21:19,580
-Take left.
-All right. Head on a swivel.

1066
01:21:45,272 --> 01:21:47,008
I've got blood.

1067
01:21:50,378 --> 01:21:52,113
Fuck. Drop it.

1068
01:22:03,691 --> 01:22:05,593
Bad move, pal.

1069
01:22:06,827 --> 01:22:09,797
Back up, back the fuck up!

1070
01:22:15,669 --> 01:22:17,471
-Drop it, punk!
-Drop the gun!

1071
01:22:17,538 --> 01:22:21,375
-No!
-Take the shot, Mike!

1072
01:22:21,442 --> 01:22:22,977
Take it. Take the shot.

1073
01:22:23,044 --> 01:22:26,213
Yeah, Mikey, If you got a shot,
you should take it.

1074
01:22:28,949 --> 01:22:30,251
Take it!

1075
01:22:52,506 --> 01:22:54,875
Oh, fu--

1076
01:22:55,476 --> 01:22:59,947
Suspect down, suspect down.

1077
01:23:00,714 --> 01:23:04,752
Fuck, fuck.

1078
01:23:12,693 --> 01:23:14,662
Where's your brother?

1079
01:23:28,676 --> 01:23:31,712
He's dead. I...

1080
01:23:31,946 --> 01:23:34,849
He's fucking dead.

1081
01:23:39,653 --> 01:23:42,189
Dead.

1082
01:23:46,994 --> 01:23:51,699
Officers need an ambulance.

1083
01:25:15,617 --> 01:25:20,622
Tell Joan how much I love her,
okay? Every day.

1084
01:25:20,689 --> 01:25:21,989
-Every day.
-Every day.

1085
01:25:22,056 --> 01:25:24,491
I'm gonna take care of her.

1086
01:25:26,727 --> 01:25:31,799
I love you so much.
So fucking much.

1087
01:25:32,366 --> 01:25:37,504
I love you, too, Jamie.
I love you.

1088
01:26:42,403 --> 01:26:46,440
-What you lookin' for?
-Somebody went in here,
tryin' to find

1089
01:26:46,507 --> 01:26:49,611
ya'll teeth or something
I can ID him by

1090
01:26:49,678 --> 01:26:51,478
before he completely dissolves.

1091
01:26:52,313 --> 01:26:54,481
I recognize this glob of shit.

1092
01:26:54,549 --> 01:26:56,950
It's the one I tattooed
at the bank.

1093
01:26:57,719 --> 01:27:00,354
-You sure?
-Absolutely.

1094
01:27:03,490 --> 01:27:06,561
-So that only
leaves the brother.
-Sir...

1095
01:27:08,095 --> 01:27:09,997
You guys wanna
take a look at this?

1096
01:27:11,865 --> 01:27:14,034
Mean anything to you?

1097
01:27:16,437 --> 01:27:18,972
I guess that means
he wasn't lying.

1098
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:22,242
-How'd that survive?
-Silver.

1099
01:27:22,309 --> 01:27:24,945
Noble metals
don't react to sulfuric acid.

1100
01:27:55,876 --> 01:27:59,313
Good afternoon, Mrs. Rishoto.
Do you remember me?

1101
01:27:59,947 --> 01:28:04,918
-Uh, Special Agent Ross.
-Yes! Are you all right?

1102
01:28:05,754 --> 01:28:08,956
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-Yeah.

1103
01:28:09,022 --> 01:28:11,225
Oh! I just...
I slipped on some water,

1104
01:28:11,291 --> 01:28:13,060
gettin' out the shower.

1105
01:28:13,127 --> 01:28:15,630
- Ouch!
- Yeah, yeah.

1106
01:28:15,697 --> 01:28:17,064
Do you mind if I come in?

1107
01:28:17,197 --> 01:28:19,933
I just have a few
follow-up questions for you.

1108
01:28:21,034 --> 01:28:24,639
-Yeah, Yeah. Sure.
-Yeah. Thank you.

1109
01:28:41,989 --> 01:28:43,957
What a beautiful baby!

1110
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:47,562
Hey, hey!

1111
01:28:48,797 --> 01:28:50,330
So, how is she doing?

1112
01:28:50,397 --> 01:28:53,200
I heard that she
had a surgery recently.

1113
01:28:54,168 --> 01:28:58,272
Last spring.
She's doin' good.

1114
01:28:58,338 --> 01:29:00,974
Doctors say she's
probably gonna be fine.

1115
01:29:01,041 --> 01:29:03,277
Oh, that's good to hear.

1116
01:29:06,046 --> 01:29:08,550
A congenital heart disorder...

1117
01:29:09,517 --> 01:29:11,251
I heard that surgery
is very expensive

1118
01:29:11,318 --> 01:29:13,420
to cover all those costs...

1119
01:29:13,888 --> 01:29:16,156
We were blessed.
We crowdfunded,

1120
01:29:16,223 --> 01:29:19,594
and a lot of generous people
came to our rescue.

1121
01:29:20,728 --> 01:29:23,765
But you already knew that,
didn't you, Special Agent.

1122
01:29:23,832 --> 01:29:25,600
You just said "we".

1123
01:29:25,667 --> 01:29:27,367
<i>We</i> were blessed?

1124
01:29:29,102 --> 01:29:32,139
Yeah, that's right.
Me and my baby.

1125
01:29:32,206 --> 01:29:34,441
That was incredibly
generous.

1126
01:29:34,508 --> 01:29:37,377
And the donors?
They're all anonymous?

1127
01:29:37,444 --> 01:29:40,147
Yeah, that's how it works.

1128
01:29:41,381 --> 01:29:44,519
-People can really surprise you.
-And the father?

1129
01:29:44,586 --> 01:29:47,956
He's not around anymore.
He's gone.

1130
01:29:48,088 --> 01:29:49,624
Oh, I'm sorry.

1131
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:55,095
Don't be. Some things
just aren't meant to be.

1132
01:29:57,397 --> 01:30:02,302
You know...
I... I have...

1133
01:30:02,369 --> 01:30:04,572
a little girl, too.

1134
01:30:05,239 --> 01:30:08,275
Well... not too little anymore.

1135
01:30:10,110 --> 01:30:14,014
-She's beautiful.
-Yeah, I think so, too.

1136
01:30:14,348 --> 01:30:19,152
But... she has
a sadness in her eyes.

1137
01:30:22,557 --> 01:30:24,224
You see it, too.

1138
01:30:27,194 --> 01:30:29,597
Yeah, that's on me.

1139
01:30:30,163 --> 01:30:32,734
You know, her mother and I...

1140
01:30:33,233 --> 01:30:35,302
were just a really bad match.

1141
01:30:35,369 --> 01:30:38,706
A bad match that caused
my daughter a lot of pain.

1142
01:30:40,775 --> 01:30:44,679
All I can do now is hope
that doesn't scar her too badly.

1143
01:30:44,746 --> 01:30:49,049
- Can I give you
a piece of advice?

1144
01:30:50,685 --> 01:30:54,589
You seem like a smart man,
a good man even.

1145
01:30:54,656 --> 01:30:57,559
But, there's somethin'
you ain't figured out yet.

1146
01:30:59,027 --> 01:31:02,429
- Really?
- Yeah...

1147
01:31:02,496 --> 01:31:06,300
My daddy, he spent a lifetime
lettin' me down.

1148
01:31:08,468 --> 01:31:13,240
But it don't matter,
'cause he still my daddy.

1149
01:31:15,677 --> 01:31:19,914
Every little girl needs one.
It's just how it is.

1150
01:31:20,347 --> 01:31:23,518
Yeah, it might take us
a while to figure that out,

1151
01:31:23,585 --> 01:31:26,186
but we always do.

1152
01:31:27,021 --> 01:31:29,857
And, really, your job...
is simple.

1153
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:32,292
Do what you can
to own your shit.

1154
01:31:32,359 --> 01:31:36,631
Try to make up for it.
And just wait for her.

1155
01:31:37,899 --> 01:31:39,534
"Wait"?

1156
01:31:40,233 --> 01:31:42,804
Yeah. Wait. That's it.

1157
01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:44,772
Don't ever give up.

1158
01:31:46,406 --> 01:31:50,444
Is that what your father did?
Wait?

1159
01:31:52,245 --> 01:31:55,315
No. He didn't.

1160
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:03,256
You said that the only option
you have was to

1161
01:32:03,323 --> 01:32:06,159
just hope your little girl
will be okay.

1162
01:32:06,594 --> 01:32:08,663
That ain't the way I see it.

1163
01:32:09,262 --> 01:32:11,198
You could just choose
to leave your ex

1164
01:32:11,264 --> 01:32:13,266
where she should
be, in the past.

1165
01:32:13,333 --> 01:32:16,470
And focus on starting over
with your daughter.

1166
01:32:20,808 --> 01:32:22,677
Hmm. You know...

1167
01:32:25,412 --> 01:32:27,715
that's really excellent advice.

1168
01:32:35,957 --> 01:32:39,493
It's been lovely chatting
with you, Special Agent Ross.

1169
01:32:40,928 --> 01:32:43,397
I hope you have a better day.

1170
01:32:46,901 --> 01:32:48,936
Good luck, Mrs. Rishoto.

1171
01:32:50,004 --> 01:32:51,505
Hey...

1172
01:32:52,974 --> 01:32:54,408
Thank you.

1173
01:33:09,090 --> 01:33:11,859
-How'd that go?
-It went.

1174
01:33:11,926 --> 01:33:13,828
And what about her?

1175
01:33:16,931 --> 01:33:19,834
Bad guys are dead.
All the money's recovered.

1176
01:33:19,901 --> 01:33:21,368
It's over.

1177
01:33:21,435 --> 01:33:24,906
Yeah, we could charge her,
absolutely ruin her.

1178
01:33:25,173 --> 01:33:27,675
And her daughter would probably
get put in the system.

1179
01:33:35,449 --> 01:33:39,187
I'll be in the car.

1180
01:35:00,802 --> 01:35:01,869
Hi.

1181
01:35:04,504 --> 01:35:06,073
It's a beautiful day.

1182
01:35:33,366 --> 01:35:35,670
I've got somebody
I want you to meet.

1183
01:35:35,736 --> 01:35:38,338
Somebody real special.

1184
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:40,842
Come on.
