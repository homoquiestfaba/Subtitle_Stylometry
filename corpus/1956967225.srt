Yeah, well, that's

married this weekend,

for you, Mancini.

362

We're two of a kind.

363
00:17:58,701 --> 00:18:00,718
God grant me the serenity

364
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:04,497
to accept the things
I cannot change,

365
00:18:04,498 --> 00:18:08,054
courage to change
the things I can,

366
00:18:08,055 --> 00:18:10,712
and the wisdom to
know the difference.

367
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:18,528
Excuse me.

368
00:18:18,528 --> 00:18:20,321
I related to everything
you shared.

369
00:18:20,323 --> 00:18:21,796

to get used to living

370
00:18:21,797 --> 00:18:23,781
this far away from home.

371
00:18:23,782 --> 00:18:25,352

You're in Armstrong's
sales division.

375

Don't tell anyone in the

376
00:18:33,263 --> 00:18:34,833
My lips are sealed.

377
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:35,953
Making friends helps.

378
00:18:35,954 --> 00:18:37,042
And having a sponsor.

379

380

Well, you do now,

382

speak pretty good English.

How could they foreclose on you?

390
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:10,711
Sydney invested
$100,000 of my money

391
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:12,663
in Mancini Designs
just last month!

392
00:19:12,664 --> 00:19:14,650
I used the money to
pay off our creditors,

393
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:16,348
but it still wasn't enough!

394
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:18,046
Maybe if you hadn't been so busy

395
00:19:18,047 --> 00:19:19,423
every time I tried to tell you
the business was in trouble,

396
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,217
Michael, it wouldn't
come as such a shock.

boy for your failure.

This is on your head, Jane!

399
00:19:30,827 --> 00:19:32,588
Half of LA is
already hard at work,

400
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,256
and you're still in
your bathrobe?

401
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:35,856
You know, Jane, if you
worked a little harder,

402
00:19:35,857 --> 00:19:38,676
you'd be able to pay DD the fees
you owe from your last campaign.

403
00:19:40,118 --> 00:19:41,527

404
00:19:41,528 --> 00:19:43,096
Oh, he is out on bail,

405

a great lawyer.

410

I don't believe this.

411
00:19:54,085 --> 00:19:55,621

you out of jail?

Oh, ask me to do something hard.

You're flattering yourself

417

a jail term for you.

418
00:20:08,756 --> 00:20:10,421
I'm an innocent man,

I'm gonna slap you with a
defamation of character suit

I'm in foreclosure.

427
00:20:28,457 --> 00:20:31,019

gonna have to get in line

Didn't she try to kill
you last year?

553
00:26:40,441 --> 00:26:43,131
Spent time in the psych ward.

554
00:26:43,132 --> 00:26:44,220
And you're out on bail

555

and assault and battery.

556

No, no, that was a

which will be cleared up.

558
00:26:48,993 --> 00:26:51,653
Yeah. Playtime's over,
I got work to do.

559
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:53,798
These pictures are
practically proof positive.

560
00:26:53,798 --> 00:26:55,592
The only thing those
pictures are proof of

561
00:26:55,593 --> 00:26:57,323
is you breaking and entering,

562
00:26:57,323 --> 00:27:01,295
so out, before I
reconsider and arrest you.

563
00:27:08,386 --> 00:27:09,604
I want you to tell

Okay! Okay.

You're good with kids.

567
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:21,680
Too bad you're
lousy with adults.

568
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,275
Well, it's great to see
you, too, Kimberly.

569
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:26,133
Amanda told me that you
bailed Michael out of jail.

570
00:27:26,134 --> 00:27:27,670
Don't you know how
dangerous he is?

571
00:27:27,671 --> 00:27:29,496
Well, Mancini may
be a lot of things,

572
00:27:29,497 --> 00:27:31,450
but I don't think he's a
one-man reign of terror.

573
00:27:31,451 --> 00:27:34,557
Right, and we know what a great
judge of character you are.

574
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:36,223
Well, you're right.

575
00:27:36,224 --> 00:27:39,459
I might have been off the
mark with Caitlin and Amanda.

Would you like to talk about

577

in choosing Mancini, hmm?

578
00:27:47,627 --> 00:27:48,972
Point well taken.

579
00:27:48,973 --> 00:27:51,663
And although you say that
I'm no judge of character,

580
00:27:51,663 --> 00:27:54,066
I've always had
great respect for you.

As well as great fascination.

583
00:28:00,314 --> 00:28:01,561
It might interest you to know

584
00:28:01,563 --> 00:28:03,451
that you've guest-starred in

585
00:28:03,451 --> 00:28:05,855
several of my sexual fantasies.

586
00:28:08,705 --> 00:28:10,146
Careful, doctor.

587
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,740
With all your trouble,
the last thing you need

588
00:28:12,741 --> 00:28:14,598
is a sexual harassment suit.

589
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:15,977
How about a date then?

590
00:28:15,978 --> 00:28:17,002
Hmm?

591
00:28:22,384 --> 00:28:25,458
I don't know.

592

What if the reality
doesn't measure up?

593
00:28:28,246 --> 00:28:30,071
What if it does?

594
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:38,912
The failure of Mancini designs

595
00:28:38,913 --> 00:28:40,451
had nothing to do

596
00:28:40,451 --> 00:28:42,019
with my ability as a designer.

597
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,430
How's that?

598
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,807
I had more orders
than I could fill.

599
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:46,856
I was fielding offers
to expand worldwide.

600
00:28:46,857 --> 00:28:49,324
I just didn't have the
capital to make it happen,

601
00:28:49,325 --> 00:28:52,207
thanks to an unfortunate
choice of business partners.

602
00:28:52,207 --> 00:28:54,480
Well, we've all made
bad choices.

603
00:28:54,481 --> 00:28:57,813
But your work is solid,

604
00:28:57,814 --> 00:29:00,695
uh, more importantly,
innovative.

605
00:29:00,696 --> 00:29:03,961
So you'll pass my portfolio

Ready for some garlic chicken?

1071
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:35,686
Pile it on.

1072
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:42,123
Uh, do you have a minute?

1073
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:43,887
Uh, yeah. Of course. Come on in.

1074
00:50:47,217 --> 00:50:49,396
Something wrong? Uh, no.

1075
00:50:49,396 --> 00:50:53,304
Just saw you and Mackenzie
earlier looking pretty cozy.

1076
00:50:53,304 --> 00:50:55,065
Kissing, actually.

1077
00:50:55,067 --> 00:50:57,980
Jane, we built
the company together.

1078
00:50:57,981 --> 00:50:59,454
What you saw was nothing more

1079
00:50:59,454 --> 00:51:00,766
than affection between friends.

1080
00:51:00,768 --> 00:51:01,824
Really?

1081
00:51:01,824 --> 00:51:03,554
And, did you mention
to your friend

1082
00:51:03,554 --> 00:51:04,782
that you spent
the night with me?

1083
00:51:11,916 --> 00:51:13,740
You're gonna have to understand

1084
00:51:13,742 --> 00:51:17,072
that these are
unusual circumstances.

1085
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:20,148
I may be the CEO, but
she's the name,

1086
00:51:20,148 --> 00:51:22,068
and whether we're
divorced or not,

1087
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:25,081
my reputation
is married to hers.

1088
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:27,708
In other words,

1089
00:51:27,708 --> 00:51:29,469
you kiss her to keep your job.

1090
00:51:29,469 --> 00:51:31,423
On some level, yes.

1091
00:51:31,425 --> 00:51:33,666
So what else do you do
to keep her happy?

1092
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,670
Not throw my love
life in her face.

1093
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:42,507
All right.

1094
00:51:42,509 --> 00:51:43,597
But know this...

1095
00:51:46,833 --> 00:51:50,963
I have no intention
of playing the other woman.

1096
00:51:50,965 --> 00:51:52,887
Especially when you're
not married.

1097
00:51:59,485 --> 00:52:00,574
I thought we'd be
in the air by now.

1098
00:52:00,574 --> 00:52:03,458
I wonder what the problem is.

1099
00:52:04,963 --> 00:52:08,132
It's a 13-hour flight,

1100
00:52:08,134 --> 00:52:10,056
and I have a wedding to get to.

1101
00:52:10,056 --> 00:52:11,882
As it is, I'm pushing it.

1102
00:52:11,882 --> 00:52:13,900
Well, I hope you're not
in the wedding party.

1103
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,110
Ladies and gentlemen, this
is your captain speaking.

1104
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:19,570
We are currently experiencing
some minor mechanical problems...

1105
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:20,786
Oh, crap.

1106
00:52:20,788 --> 00:52:22,869
Probably have to
change planes now.

1107
00:52:22,871 --> 00:52:24,791
While the aircraft
is being serviced,

1108
00:52:24,793 --> 00:52:28,282
please feel free to enjoy
our first class lounge.

1109
00:52:28,282 --> 00:52:32,193
We estimate the delay to
be approximately four hours.

1110
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,235
I'm not gonna make it.

1111
00:52:42,443 --> 00:52:43,659
You know, for years
I've been trying

1112
00:52:43,659 --> 00:52:44,907
to get invited to this event,

1113
00:52:44,909 --> 00:52:47,503
But now,

1114
00:52:47,503 --> 00:52:49,650
all I want to do is go
home and jump your bones.

1115
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:52,563
Easy, Tiger, business
before pleasure, right?

1116
00:52:52,565 --> 00:52:54,134
Thank you.

1117
00:52:54,135 --> 00:52:55,288
Thank you.

1118
00:53:00,092 --> 00:53:01,726
I want you, Peter,

1119
00:53:01,726 --> 00:53:03,967
like I've never wanted
any other man.

1120
00:53:03,967 --> 00:53:06,083
The feeling is mutual,

1121
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:08,612
and I promise I'll
prove it to you...

1122
00:53:08,614 --> 00:53:09,990
later.

1123
00:53:11,849 --> 00:53:13,449
Have I told you

1124
00:53:13,451 --> 00:53:14,699
how beautiful you look tonight?

1125
00:53:14,699 --> 00:53:16,653
Hmm?

1126

You make me feel beautiful.

1127
00:53:19,056 --> 00:53:21,139
You make me feel
a lot of things.

1128
00:53:22,996 --> 00:53:25,686
I've had a lot
of demons in my life,

1129
00:53:25,688 --> 00:53:28,570
but now that you're part of it,

1130
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:29,818
they're gone.

What, um, what are
you two doing here?

1134
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,126
Well, Michael was
invited... of course...

1135
00:53:41,128 --> 00:53:42,889
By your date, and he brought me.

1136
00:53:42,889 --> 00:53:44,554
Well, as your doctor,
my advice is

1137
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,829
dating Michael can be
hazardous to your health.

1138
00:53:46,829 --> 00:53:48,398
So glad you both could join us.

1139
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,903
A pleasure, Pete.

1140
00:53:49,905 --> 00:53:51,025
I wish I could say the same,

1141
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:52,755
but I hate cheap
sentiments, don't you?

1142
00:53:52,755 --> 00:53:54,965
You know, Michael, I never
realized how little class you had

1143
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:57,367
until I started dating someone
who actually had some.

1144
00:53:57,369 --> 00:54:00,219
Yeah, well, don't count on
it rubbing off, Kimberly.

Now, who here might
benefit my career?

Ah, let's start with cardiology

I've since come to learn

00:56:50,733 --> 00:56:55,088
that in light of the patient's
now-documented symptoms,

1192
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:57,972
Dr. Burns had every
reason to believe

1193
00:56:57,972 --> 00:57:00,085
that surgery was necessary.

and any testimony
you may hear to the contrary

1196
00:57:05,597 --> 00:57:08,768
will only be coming from a
money-hungry former patient

1197
00:57:08,768 --> 00:57:10,690
looking for a lawsuit.

As far as I'm concerned, all
the doctors who treated me

1203
00:57:19,306 --> 00:57:20,972
should have their
license taken away,

1204
00:57:20,972 --> 00:57:23,246

Dr. Burns' license,
