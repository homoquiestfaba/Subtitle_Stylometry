No, no. Not that one.
That's mama's heart chakra.

She doesn't know you.
How much did you pay her?

667
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:36,459
Everything I had, plus an IOU.

668
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:40,212
You know, I tried to call you,
but you weren't there.

669
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,451
- I've been thinking about you.
- Really?

670
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:46,613
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>
- No, you haven't. I miss you, Stella.

671
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:48,577
No, you don't.

672
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:52,778
- Could you hold for a minute?
- Yeah.

673
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,696
Hi. I'm back.

674
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:08,936
So, where we just left off, you were just
getting into how much you miss me.

675
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:10,733
I, uh....

676
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:15,492
I wrote you a letter,
but I was a little afraid to send it.

677
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,175
Fax it to me.

678
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:19,695
I want to see you, Stella.

679
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:22,375
<i>Why don't you come to the point?</i>

680
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:25,818
Look, Winston, I really don't see
how that's possible.

681
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,859
Well, in three months,
I can take a sick leave.

682
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:35,377
Well.... Maybe I could arrange something.

683
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:37,929
I did promise Quincy
I'd bring him to Jamaica.

684
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,376
Yes, Mom! How soon? How soon?

685
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:42,178
<i>- How soon?</i>
QUINCY: Can Chantel come too?

686
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:44,775
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

687
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:48,729
Let me think about it
and I'll call you back with the details.

688
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:53,253
Oh, Stella, when you come,
could you bring me some junk food?

689
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:55,457
<i>- Junk food?</i>
- Yeah.

690
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:59,329
I need Snickers, uh, HoHos...

691
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,538
...Oreos and Cocoa Puffs.

692
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:04,214
What will you do for me?

693
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,532
Oh, I'll think of something.

694
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:07,929
<i>You do that.</i>

695
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,178
All right. I'll call you back tonight.

696
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:11,928
I can't wait.

697
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:13,729
Bye.

698
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:16,053
Bye-bye.

699
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:57,139
Stella.

700
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,971
Hey!

701
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:07,091
CHANTEL:
Who's that guy with Auntie Stell?

702
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:10,059
QUINCY: That's her new boyfriend
she came all this way to find...

703
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,337
...because she couldn't find one
in America.

704
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,219
But he's also very young.

705
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:16,371
How young is he?

706
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,059
Not quite 30.

707
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:22,418
That's not young.
He sure is cute.

708
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:26,449
Well, as you can see, he's already taken.
Marco!

709
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:28,049
Polo.

710
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:32,296
Hey, you guys.
I want you to meet someone.

711
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:34,489
What do you say, Quincy?

712
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:37,128
- Hi.
WINSTON: How are you doing?

713
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:40,130
And you must be Chanel.

714
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,212
It's "Chantel."
Hi.

715
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:46,691
Excuse me. Chantel.
It's very nice to meet you.

716
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,417
Well, Ms. Stella Payne.

717
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:59,652
Welcome back to Jamaica.

718
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,973
Marco!

719
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,374
QUINCY AND CHANTEL:
Polo!

720
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:08,294
CHANTEL: Polo!
QUINCY: Polo! Polo! Polo!

721
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:11,294
WINSTON: Marco!
QUINCY: Polo!

722
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:15,459
STELLA: Be careful, you guys.
WINSTON: Yeah, look sharp!

723
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:30,739
What can I get you?

724
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,414
A Ting, please.

725
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:37,937
- And for you?
WINSTON: The same. Ting.

726
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:41,530
Your son sure favors you a lot.

727
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:46,694
Mm-mm. He really takes after his dad.

728
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:50,854
He's just grown so much
since the last time I saw him.

729
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:52,534
How long's that been?

730
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:53,975
Say about....

731
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:55,334
Yeah, about a year.

732
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,934
His dad and I divorced four years ago.

733
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,490
That's sad,
but lots of that's going around.

734
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:02,974
STELLA:
Mm-hmm.

735
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:04,938
Well....

736
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:08,094
You sure look happy to see your mom.

737
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:12,211
Yeah, man.

738
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:16,930
Let me show you how happy I am.

739
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:28,251
- What's her problem?
- I don't know.

740
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:30,775
- Come on. Let's dance.
- Cool.

741
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,613
Come on.

742
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,577
I quit my job.

743
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:43,091
You look like you're apologizing for it.

744
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:47,299
Well, I don't want you to think
that I'm frivolous.

745
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:52,455
I tell you what. I quit mine too.

746
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:56,010
- Yeah, right after they fired me.
- What?

747
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:59,419
- Are you okay?
- Yes and no.

748
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:02,572
I'm getting good legal advice,
so I may even come out ahead.

749
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:05,209
I'm not talking about the money.

750
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:06,859
No?

751
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:11,979
I mean, if my father
couldn't practice medicine anymore...

752
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:16,299
...boy, the man would not know
what to do with himself.

753
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:23,052
It would be as if someone
just took away his identity.

754
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:27,693
So don't try and pretend
like it's not a big deal...

755
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,294
...because I know that it is.

756
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:32,779
Well, I....

757
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:36,699
I feel betrayed,
if you want to know the truth.

758
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:42,094
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't afford
to just go crazy about it, could I?

759
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:45,217
Yes, you can.

760
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:58,697
I will do your worrying for you tonight.

761
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:02,659
So hush.

762
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:10,010
[PHONE RINGS]

763
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:13,575
Yeah?

764
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:17,375
Stella, have you let that boy up
for some air yet?

765
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:20,295
<i>Let me talk to him.
I know he's buried under there.</i>

766
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:22,452
Winnie, can you hear me, baby?

767
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:26,130
Shut up.
He's on a banana boat with the kids.

768
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:28,337
What took you so long
to return my call?

769
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:32,095
I could be down here losing my mind
and you wouldn't know it.

770
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:35,090
- How are you doing?
<i>- I've had better days.</i>

771
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:39,173
I won't waste this expensive phone call
talking about me, Miss Thing.

772
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:42,060
For a girl who lost her job,
you sound awfully chipper.

773
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:43,495
I must say, I love it, though.

774
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:45,970
Yeah, I should be ashamed of myself...

775
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:48,575
...down here acting
like a lovesick college girl.

776
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:52,290
- What are we, PMS-ing now?
<i>- No, we are not.</i>

777
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:56,294
Haven't you ever done something so crazy
you had to keep it to yourself?

778
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:59,019
Yeah, but I can't remember
none of their names.

779
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:00,694
<i>I didn't used to be this crazy.</i>

780
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,931
I beg to differ, darling.

781
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:08,016
Yeah, I just had to open my big mouth.
"You want to be intimate with me?"

782
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:10,933
You opened it so wide,
I saw you on <i>Hard Copy.</i>

783
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,453
You looked good, though.

784
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:15,010
Hush up, girl.
I'm trying to be serious.

785
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:18,696
Life is too short
for us to be bullshitting ourselves, girl.

786
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:21,533
We've had this conversation
four or five times now.

787
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:25,740
For the last time I'm going to ask, what
is wrong with you liking this young man?

788
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:30,093
D, he doesn't get it.

789
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:33,058
He's just a kid, you know?

790
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:36,531
He hasn't been anywhere,
done anything.

791
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,259
He can't even buy me a drink.

792
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:40,092
He don't know the first thing--

793
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:41,899
Oh, hell, D.

794
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:44,449
He hasn't even had his heart broken.

795
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:47,930
And this morning,
I found Cocoa Puffs in the bed.

796
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:52,936
Cocoa Puffs? Ooh, girl!
Young and innovative.

797
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,814
I don't know whether I'm coming or going.

798
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,777
<i>Look, that's a good thing.</i>

799
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:02,534
It means you ain't gonna get bored.
You know?

800
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,771
You ain't gonna get bored, girl.

801
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:06,659
<i>Now, if you are done...</i>

802
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:10,529
<i>... with this week's episode
of</i> The Young, Restless and the Colored...

803
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:13,737
...I gotta go.
I got folks waiting on me.

804
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:18,299
Give my godson a big old kiss for me,
and take one for you too.

805
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:19,929
I love you, Stell.

806
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:21,893
Yeah, you too.

807
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,089
Bye.

808
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,935
WINSTON: Okay.
STELLA: All right.

809
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:59,736
- Yeah.
QUINCY: Yeah.

810
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:02,617
- You see those horses?
CHANTEL: Yeah!

811
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:06,894
Wow. This is beautiful.

812
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,179
It doesn't look like a restaurant.

813
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:13,332
That's because it's my folks' place.

814
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:17,499
STELLA: You didn't tell me.
WINSTON: I wanted it to be a surprise.

815
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:21,494
- I don't like surprises like this. Look at me.
- You look beautiful.

816
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:25,335
- Your mom will think I look like a hooker.
- Relax, please.

817
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:38,215
Mommy, Daddy,
I would like you to meet Stella.

818
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:41,737
STELLA: Hi.
- Stella, very nice to meet you.

819
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:43,334
Thank you.

820
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:46,218
Hungry?

821
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:48,294
A little.

822
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,419
Are those your teenagers?

823
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:55,619
No. Yes.
My son's 11 and so is my niece.

824
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:58,692
I'll go get them. Excuse me.

825
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:02,698
Well, Stella....

826
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,655
Allow me to show you our home, hm?

827
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:07,814
Okay.

828
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:16,773
WINSTON: No one would ride the horse
because she was so wild.

829
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:18,896
But me a real rider,
so I'm gonna ride her.

830
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:22,098
QUINCY: And then what happened?
WINSTON: She threw me, of course.

831
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:27,015
MAID:
I'll get it for you, ma'am.

832
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,539
STELLA:
Can I help?

833
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:32,295
No, the workers can handle it.

834
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:37,100

What? Did I miss something?

1333
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:44,160
Last week I asked you to marry me...

1334
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:47,719
...to spend the rest of your life with me,
and I don't have an answer.

1335
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:51,006
- Do we have to talk now?
- How long do I wait for an answer?

1336
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:53,080
Should I pretend that I didn't ask?

1337
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:57,637
- So you can be so selfish--
- Look! Don't talk to my mama like that!

1338
01:43:57,800 --> 01:43:59,640
QUINCY: I'm talking to you--
- Jump back, boy--

1339
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:02,277
Wait. Don't speak to my son
in that tone of voice.

1340
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:05,725
- Yeah, because I don't appreciate it.
- Shut up, Quincy.

1341
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:14,086
Quincy, I'm sorry, man.

1342

Winston, we need to talk.

1347
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:34,165
I know. Climb in.

1348
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:37,044
Come on. I won't let you fall.

1349
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:43,522
All right, put your head back.

1350
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:47,442
- Okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1351
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:50,248
Um....

1352
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,840
You know, I need to talk to you too.

1353
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,567
Yeah, about what?

1354
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:58,608
- No, please. You can go first.
- No, you go.

1355
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:03,603
I've been thinking a lot about some
of the things that you've been saying.

1356

STELLA:
Really? What things?

1357
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:11,797
You have a lot of worries in your life now
without figuring me into the picture.

1358
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:17,158
And a real man, the kind you deserve...

1359
01:48:17,320 --> 01:48:19,320
...would be making things easier for you.

1360
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:23,528
STELLA: You're not adding to my
troubles, if that's what you're thinking.

1361
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:29,480
Besides, money's a sad reason
for folk to be together.

Or apart.

WINSTON:
Yes, but without it, life can be hard.

1364
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:41,926
- Then there is the age difference.
- That's never gonna change.

1365
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:44,444
It doesn't bother me at all.

1366
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:46,839
But I can see it bothers you.

1367
01:48:47,120 --> 01:48:50,917
And I can't imagine
what I'd have to do or tell you...

1368
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:56,004
...to convince you that no matter
how many young girls I may notice...

1369
01:48:57,800 --> 01:49:00,721
...you are the woman that I want.

1370
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:07,999
I was hoping to one day
be your husband...

1371
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:10,364
...have some children.

1372
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:13,646
But I can see now that
that could never happen.

1373
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:15,965
Probably not.

1374
01:49:16,120 --> 01:49:20,247
You have a child, and a mortgage,
and a career...

1375
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:25,244
...and I have nothing,
and I'm not satisfied with that.

1376
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:26,808
Not satisfied.

1377
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:29,642
Winston, don't worry.

1378
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:32,437
It's coming. You'll find your way.

1379
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:39,082
Well, I realize that I'm ready
to go to medical school.

1380
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:44,841
So I'm heading home on a 10:00 flight.

1381

Home?

1382
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:51,725
Why so soon?

1383
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:54,881
Because I think it's easier this way.
