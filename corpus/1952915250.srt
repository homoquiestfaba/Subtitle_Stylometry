You can't hang out

But yeah , man ,

58
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,573
'cause some people
can handle alcohol .

59
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,041
You know who you are.

60
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,876
Some people can't.

61
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,077
And you have no clue.

62
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,581
Guys especially.
You know how it goes.

or the "mere" guy.

67
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:44,690
You know that guy, right?

68
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,992

Oh my God ,
l can't handle alcohol .

72
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,008
People, when they get drunk
they say things they
don't mean .

73
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,643
You know when l'm drunk

Woo! l'm going running .

75
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,815
[laughter]

76
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,551
You better

Aw, hell , yeah man .

And when l drink,
l only drink like
regular alcohol .

l don't do beer.
Beer just doesn't--no.

80
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,826
Beer makes me
talk to my body.

81
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,094
l don't like that.

82
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:23,562
When l get drunk

[audience woos
and cheers]

94
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,465
That's what l say.
You just gotta be
careful , you know.

95
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,769
And if you're gonna drink

about driving ,

You know

98
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,342
You're doing laps
in the parking lot

99
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,411
and you can't
find the exit. Hello?

100
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,379
Some of you make

No, no, no, don't do that.

00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:29,988
'Cause you're not
gonna get very far.

[laughter]

134
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:56,681
You have no idea
how bad you're gonna
throw his ass off, you guys.

135
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:59,918
He's gonna come over

136
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,095
And you're
sitting there. . .

They're not, man .

171
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,753
They care about safety,

00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,822
and that sucks, 'cause
l could handle one bar.

173
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,090
One bar, l'm cool .

174
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:49,761
But now they got
the whole--[clacking]

175
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:53,131
lf you're fluffy,
one of those is
not gonna lock.

176
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,767
You're trying--

177
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,570
People are in line,
You can do it!

178
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,343
One time l took a trip
with my buddy Mondo.

179
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,012
A big guy,
another big guy.

180
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,581
And l went with him
because his family,
they decided to go

181
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,517
and he didn't want to be
the only one hanging out
by the strollers.

182
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:13,885
[laughter]

183
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,420
So we're hanging out
at the end of the day,

184
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,956
my buddy Mondo goes,
Dude, we should
get on a ride!

185
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,226
l go, Which one? We can't
get on none of them , dude,
we're too big .

186
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,463
He goes, there's a ride here
at Disneyland that's called
Splash Mountain .

187
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,265
l go, What is that?

188
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,568
He goes, lt's a log
and you get inside
the log

189
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:33,505
and it goes uphill ,
it goes down , and
makes a splash .

190
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,540
No seatbelt,
no pull-bar.

191
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,776
You just get in and go.

192
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,846
l go, No seatbelt?
No pull-bar?
[high-pitched laugh]

193
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,381
[laughter]

194
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,483
So we get in line
for our ride, we're
all pumped up,

195
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,752
and l see people
getting off the ride
with these little note cards.

196
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,421
l go, What are those?

197
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,089
He goes, oh , they take
a photo of you when
you go downhill .

198
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,391
Oh , okay, cool .
So we get to the
front of the line,

199
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,994
and then we have to deal
with the lady with
the headset,

200
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,929
the lady who
takes her job
way too serious.

201
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,298
[high-pitched female]
Okay, how many people?
Four? Okay. Two here, two here.

202
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,601
How many, five?
Okay, three there,
two there.

203
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,936
We get to the front,
How many peo--?

204
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,605
[laughter]

205
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,807
Who cares? We
get our own boat.
We take off.

206
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,843
[beeping]
[hissing]
[chugging]

207
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,745
[splashing]

208
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,014
We're splishing and
splashing like
little kids--

209
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:18,316
[high-pitched laughter]

210
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,686
Three minutes go by,
the moment of truth ,
we get to the hill .

211
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:27,292
[splash]
[chugging]

212
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:31,896
[chugging stops]
[hissing]

213
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:38,637
[laughter]

214
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,639
My buddy Mondo
turns around ,
he says,

215
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:43,274
Dude, let's
flash the camera.

216
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,610
[loud laughter]

217
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,113
l said , You're stupid .

218
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,347
l'm down .

219
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,149
[loud laughter]

220
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,550
So as soon as
they let us go, right?

221
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:53,618
[hissing]

222
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,321
[long howl]

223
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,490
[loud laughter]

224
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,925
[howl]
[splash]

225
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,261
We get off the ride,
we are soaking wet,

226
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,329
[screeching laughter]

227
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:08,333
[squish , squish]

228
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,102
We're all rosado
right here.

229
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,638
We got a mean
old baby rash .

230
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:18,076
[squish squish]

231
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,278
We go to buy
the picture,

232
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,247
and there's a lady
behind the counter

233
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:23,848
with her hand
on the screen .

234
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,450
[chuckles]

235
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:28,119
And l ask my buddy Mondo,
l said , Bro, what boat
are we?

236
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:32,257
He says, 22 .
l go, She's
covering 22 !

237
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,892
He goes, Oh , we better
sneak out of here.

238
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,627
Ho, yeah , we're
gonna sneak out.

239
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,930
[squish squish]

240
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:43,068
We get past the picture girl
but then we get stopped
by Disney Security.

241
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,603
And you have not lived
until you been stopped

242
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:50,909
by a freaking man
wearing a badge in
the shape of a mouse.

243
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,179
This guy was like,
[Southern male accent]
HoId on! HoId on a second!

244
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,481
Ma'am , move away
your hand from
the screen .

245
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,717
You guys see
what l see here?

246
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,485
That's a disgrace
to this park!

247
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:03,455
We can't believe anyone
could take such a photo.

248
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,291
My question to you guys--

249
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:09,060
Do you recognize
the two big women
in this picture?

250
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,762
[laughter]

251
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,273
And it wasn't until
we walked over to
this photo

252
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,610
that my buddy
Armando and l realized
something about ourselves.

253
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,680
And that is that when two
full-grown fluffy men

254
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:32,283
are going downhill
at a 45-degree angle,

255
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,019
with no shirts on ,
going like this,

256
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,088
[laughter]

257
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,891
we both look
like sexy bitches.

258
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,693
[laughter]

259
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,202
But again , if
you're gonna drink,
just be careful, you guys.

260
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,304
Some of you can handle,
and some can't--

261
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:57,776
l got kicked
out of a bar on
Saint Patrick's Day.

262
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,279
l was performing
at the bar.

263
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:02,914
How do l get
thrown out, right?

264
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,983
l'm having fun ,
people are giving
me free drinks.

265
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,085
[high-pitched female]
Here, have
another drink.

266
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:08,386
l'm , like, woo!

267
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,321
l started pissing off
the management

268
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,757
and the owners
of this l rish
place that l was at.

269
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,794
The bartender's like,
Hey, buddy, relax!

270
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,997
Are you okay?
Are you having
a good time?

271
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,999
l was so drunk
l did this:

272
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,635
[imitates l rish accent]
l'm having a great time.

273
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:31,643
People around me,
Oh my God , are
you l rish?

274
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:35,680
l was, like,
[imitates l rish accent]
Aye!

275
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,216
They're, like, What
part of l reland
are you from?

276
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,318
Uh , downtown .

277
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:41,853
Are you here by yourself?

278
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:45,156
Oh , no, l'm not
here by myself.

279
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,357
Donkey!

280
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,559
[laughter]

281
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,403
Now if you're not laughing ,
you need to get out more often
because that's a funny joke.

282
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,205
That's hysterical .
Ask a 1 0-year old ,
they'll tell you ,

283
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,373
[childish voice]
That's funny!

284
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,843
l did that joke
one night at
Memphis, Tennessee.

285
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,078
And some guy thought
he knew why it was funny.

286
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,280
And he was way off
but he confronted
me outside,

287
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:13,585
all drunk,
[Southern accent]
Hey, you ! Fluffy!

288
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,986
l'm , like, What?

289
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,821
Mere.

290
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,023
No, you mere.

291
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:22,794
And he walks over and he says,
l have to tell you your
show was hysterical .

292
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:26,898
l done near wet myself
when you said 'Donkey!'

293
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,034
My friend Rod didn't laugh
so l had to explain it
to him

294
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,270
and he thinks l'm wrong
but l know l'm right.

295
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,038
Could yah set
the record straight?

296
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,907
Sure, what'd you
tell your friend?

297
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,409
Okay, look here,
l told him the reason
why it was funnier than hell

298
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,112
when you said 'Donkey!'--

299
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,947
it's 'cause you're Mexican .

300
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:46,951
[laughter]

301
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:50,421
And you people ride Donkeys!

302
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,858
[laughter]

303
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:56,461
Normally, l woulda been
all over this guy

304
00:14:56,595 --> 00:15:00,231
but two things,
one, l was in
Memphis, Tennessee,

305
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,566
no support.

306
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,067
[laughter]

307
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,535
And , two,
the guy was drunk.

308
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,804
l just don't deal
with drunk people,
man , uh-uh .

309
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,406
When it comes to
drinking and women ,

310
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,707
ladies, when you go out,

311
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,910
make sure you take
one guy with you .

312
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,278
You need to take one guy,

313
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,046
even if he's--
[high-pitched]
Oh , my God !

314
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,147
You need one.

315
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,348
[laughter]

316
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,150
'Cause a group of you
get together,

317
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,719
there's always one
who will elect herself
the team captain , right?

318
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,822
Try to rally the troops?
Get everybody together--

319
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,457
[high-pitched]
Okay, look,
[laughs]

320
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,860
check it out,
this is a--shut up!
[laughs]

321
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,628
Okay, look, this
is what's gonna happen .

322
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,363
We're gonna take my car,
so leave your car,

323
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:35,667
my car, leave your car,
ready, ready, let's go.

324
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:42,273
They get in the car--
[motor noises] .

325
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:46,744
They get to the club--
[motor noises] .

326
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:51,015
[clicking heels]

327
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,717
[high-pitched]
Oh no, my purse!

328
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,620
[clicking]

329
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,156
They go inside the club,
they start jamming ,
having fun ,

330
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,290
[club music beat]

331
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,097
(male voice)
Oo-lah !

332
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:09,767
[club music beat]

333
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:13,338
End of the night,
that same girl who's
been the leader,

334
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,975
the captain , she gets
more hammered than everybody.

335
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,010
She's the biggest
hypocrite walking ,

336
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:22,213
now missing a shoe,
purse, keys, friends, car.

337
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,716
Look, some of
you are pointing ,

[laughter]

343
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:40,431

00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,237
Even when you're drunk,
you could be drunk and blind ,

00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,039
you know where you're at,
as long as you hear--

by one of the dancers.

366
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,483
You gotta

367
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,152
or they get mad at you .
They'll get mad .

anybody freaking out

455
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:39,797
or reporting me to
the management with
concerns or issues, you know.

456
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:42,700
[male Southern accent]
What the hell is

What kind of

l didn't know why
the guy thought l

463
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:09,193
And l've had this happen
a couple times where people
go, Are you Hawaiian?

464
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,962
Why, no.
lt's not
just the shirt.

465
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:14,832
l thought it was just the
shirt but no, how can
it just be a shirt?

466
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:18,836
Just because you wear
a freakin' sombrero, that
doesn't make you Mexican .

467
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,738
l see white people
wearing a sarape,

468
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:22,540
walking a donkey
with a sombrero,

469
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,709
you don't look at 'em
and go, Hola, amigo.

470
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:28,746
No, you're like,
Hey, Ted . Hi .

You know, and he's
walking around
Hola. Come on .

Come on .

473
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:40,524
l don't get it, man .
But it's funny though .

474
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,960
l didn't know why
the guy thought
l was Hawaiian

475
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:45,196
until l actually
went to Hawaii ,

476
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:49,834
l found out that Hawaiian
people actually look like
swollen Mexicans.

477
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,502

l loved Hawaii .
Hawaii was great, man .

483
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,258
They have a lot of
different cultures there.

484
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,260
They have a lot
of Asian people.

485
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,795
A lot. A lot of Koreans.

486
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:20,498
l know this because l got
a couple of shirts tailored

487
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,066
at some places,

488
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,368

Korean lady.

489
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:28,072
An older Korean lady.
Who was mean .

l'm there for a week

492
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,311
and every day she
had a different comment.

493
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,781
l walk in one day and ,
l couldn't say
anything either

494
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,249
'cause she was
75 years old .

495
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,084
l can't say
nothing back.

496
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:41,419
But there l am ,
walking in .

497
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:42,520

00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:05,509
Whatever.
[chuckles]

507
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,545
Don't make
fun of me.

508
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,380
But l can handle it,
you know.

509
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:10,948
l can handle it.
People say,

510
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:13,317
Gabriel , you
go up there and
you make fun of yourself.

511
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,085
No, l don't.

512
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,722
l come up here and l
tell you the things
that l heard people say.

513
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:20,357
There's a difference.

514
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:24,094
Sometimes l set myself up
for jokes and l don't
realize it.

515
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,397
Three years ago,
l bought a Beetle.

516
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:27,765
Not even thinking .

517
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,066
[light laughter]

518
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,935
That's not the joke,
shut up.

519
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,370
[loud laughter]

520
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:35,105
See, l can't even
tell you guys a story.

521
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,974
[high-pitched laughter]
Hmm .

522
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:38,609
l wasn't thinking ,
l bought the car

523
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:41,512
'cause it was affordable,
economical , brand new

524
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,347
freakin' Beetle for,
like, 1 7 grand .

525
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,583
l was, like,
[high-pitched screech]
first new car.

526
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:48,052
l go to show it off
at my friend Martin's house.

527
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:53,023
l thought it was nice,
l pull up, you know,
[rrr, screech]

528
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,026
Martiiin !

529
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,363
He lives in the Hood ,
l don't get out of
the car.

530
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,999
Across the street
there are these gang members,

531
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:05,436
they don't really get into
shooting people and stuff
like that,

532
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,738
they just hang out
on the porch and
talk a lot of smack.

533
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:10,441
So l'm there in the Beetle
and across the street
l hear this,

534
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:11,809
l'm , like, Martiiin !

535
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:13,110
And over here, l hear--

536
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,745
Orale.

537
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,149
[laughter]

538
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,619
Hey, what's up, guys?
How's it going?

539
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:24,622
(more distant voice)
How'd you get in there ese.

540
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:25,756
[laughter]

541
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,563
Hurry up, Martin !

542
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,898
[laughter]

543
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,734
Two months later,
l go back to pick him up.

544
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,903
Now l've had some time
to work on the car,

545
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,205
l put some rims on it,
some stickers,

546
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,474
l put a chip in the motor
so it goes faster.

547
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,409
l thought l was bad , right?
l pull up,

548
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,778
[rrr, tires screech]

549
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,147
[rrr, rrr]

550
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,950
Martiiin !

551
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:54,752
Orale!

552
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:55,953
[laughter]

553
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,289
Uh-uh , l'm not
turning around .

554
00:25:58,423 --> 00:25:59,523
Hey.

555
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:00,824
Uh-uh .

556
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:01,892
Hey.

557
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:03,527
l don't see you .

558
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,629
Yoo-hoo!

559
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:06,697
[grrr]

560
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:07,765
Hey!

561
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,266
[grrr]
What! !

562
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,436
Check it out, hey,
it's the fat and
the furious.

563
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,804
[laughter]

564
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:25,516
l didn't even
wait, man .
[rrrrrr]

565
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,785
l got rid of
that car, man .

566
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,589
l traded it in and got
myself a big old SUV.

567
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,390
lt was nice for a while.

568
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:37,595
This car freakin' sucked
on mileage. l got 1 1 miles
to the gallon .

569
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,396
Oh , you cannot
be bad-ass in a car

570
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,732
that kills gas
like l kill tacos,
you can't.

571
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:43,500
[laughter]

572
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,869
You can't be at the
stoplight trying to
intimidate other cars,

573
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,137
What? What, what, what?

574
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,573
[rrrrrrrrr]

575
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,141
Twenty bucks right there.

576
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,079
Hell , no.
But it was
kind of cool .

577
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:57,715
lt had a G PS
navigational system in it.

578
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:59,683
An OnStar which
is really cool .

579
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:02,653
l'm driving , and all
of a sudden this girl's
talking to me,

580
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,855
[ping]
(pleasant female voice)
Right turn , up ahead .

581
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,991
Whoa.

582
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,361
[ping]
At three quarter tenth
of a mile, left turn .

583
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:12,496
And l'm , like,
Whatever you say, baby.

584
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:17,534
Being a big guy,
l've noticed that
people feel compelled

585
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:19,637
to tell me certain
things after shows.

586
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:23,440
l get people that'll pull
me aside and go, Gabriel ,
you're a very funny guy,

587
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:26,110
you're very talented ,
don't you think, perhaps,

588
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,912
you're living a
little excess in life?

589
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,315
And l'm like,
Well , l love to eat.

590
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:33,117
Well , don't you want
to live to be a hundred?

591
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:36,286
Well , not if
l can't eat tacos.

592
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:38,555
Or as many
as l want.

593
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:42,059
A lot of people think
that just because you
work out and lift weights,

594
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:44,795
and you eat right
and you do what people
tell you to do,

595
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:47,264
that you'll
live a long life.
Maybe you will ,

596
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:50,167
but, you know,
why do people measure
life by the years

597
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:52,069
instead of how good
the years were?

598
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:54,571
l'll measure by freakin'--
you know what l mean?

599
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:58,776
[cheering , whistling]

600
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,377
What good is it
to live to be a hundred

601
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,745
but you didn't
do anything?

602
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,980
You didn't go out
and kick it
with friends,

603
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:04,314
go out and get drunk
at some club

604
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:05,783
and wake
up in an alley
at one time?

605
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:07,451
You know?

606
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:10,354
What good is it?
You stayed in the house
and you were safe.

607
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:12,089
And l lived
to be a hundred .

608
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:13,657
You know,
l don't know.

609
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:16,627
That's why, l , um ,
l have a very big
amount of respect

610
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:18,996
for the crocodile hunter,
rest in peace, but,

611
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:24,334
come on , you guys,
yeah , he died at
44 years old , but,

612
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:27,237
he died doing
what he loves to do.

613
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,940
Not a lot of people
can say that.

614
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:32,342
lf l die tomorrow
from overeating ,
hoo-hoo,

615
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,312
God bless me,
that's exactly how
it was supposed to be.

616
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,781
[cheering]

617
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,683
You know how much
adrenaline he had?

618
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,552
Every single day,
risking his life,

619
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:44,088
you know how you
feel when you're about
to cross the street

620
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,889
and a car--
[rrrrrr]

621
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,491
and your ass
almost gets hit,

622
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:51,662
and you're like--
[screech]
Oh ! Oh ! Oh !

623
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:55,199
Oh ! and then
you're hysterical .
[high-pitched laughter]

624
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,668
Oh , my God !
l almost died .
[laughs]

625
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:00,771
Touch me.
Touch me right here.
Oh , my--

626
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,140
And the rest of the day,
you appreciate life,

627
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:05,676
looking at the birds
or the sky,

628
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,078
[sings]
You're loving life.

629
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,114
He did that
every day.

630
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,815
That's why every day
l try to live

631
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,885
just a little bit of my
life like l might not
be here tomorrow.

632
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:17,454
'Cause you never know.
l don't wanna die tomorrow

633
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,890
knowing l
coulda had a piece
of cake tonight.

634
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:26,830
Sure. That's why
people tell me

635
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,066
Why don't you work out?
Why don't you lift weights?

636
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,467
What if l'm
gonna die tomorrow?

637
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,570
l don't want
to die sore.

638
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,272
l wanna die full .

639
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:36,774
When the coroner cuts me up,

640
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:39,543
l want the whole room to
smell like potato wedges.

641
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:41,245
[laughter]

642
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:44,448
And he's gonna go,
This guy knew how
to live, right here, man .

643
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:46,750
Good times.
But again , the
crocodile hunter,

644
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:49,419
l give him a lot of
love, a lot of credit
but people go,

645
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:52,689
[high-pitched]
lt's such a loss to
the nature community,

646
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:56,527
you know, he taught
us so much about nature.

647
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:58,529
And l got
mad when l heard
this lady on TV

648
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:00,397
saying that
he taught us a
lot about nature

649
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:03,267
and it was, like,
No, he didn't really
teach a lot about nature,

650
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:07,304
if you want
to learn about nature,
you watch Discovery channel

651
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:10,307
or one of these nature
programs where they have
a guy on safari

652
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:11,675
and he's studying from afar.

653
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,911
Crocodile hunter, no.
Come on , every episode,

654
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:16,146
[imitates Steve l rwin]
Hey, how you doin'?

655
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,549
Look over there,
right there.

656
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:20,818
lt's a "toiger."

657
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:25,255
That toiger weighs 800 pounds
and it could kill a man
in 1 0 seconds.

658
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,323
l'm gonna touch it.

659
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:27,491
[laughter]

660
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:35,499
Hi , tiger.

661
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:36,567
[grrr]

662
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:40,037
Ow, he's angry!
He's angry.

663
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,506
Next episode,
There's a king cobra,

664
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,775
the most venomous
snake in all the planet.

665
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:47,578
One "boite"
and l'm dead .

666
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:48,745
l'm gonna pick it up.

667
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,880
[laughter]

668
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:50,948
[hissing]

669
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,617
He's angry!

670
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:56,520
lf he really wanted
people to think he
was out there, man ,

671
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:59,156
America, we should've
borrowed him ,

672
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,625
and sent him to l raq .

673
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:04,494
With no gun ,
just a camera crew.

674
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:07,431
Do you imagine
how bad that woulda
freaked out the enemy?

675
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:10,300
You're a freakin' soldier
working for Al-Qaeda and
you're out there, you know,

676
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:16,073
[imitates l raq
accent, unintelligible]

677
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,709
And he's
walking toward him
wearing shorts,

678
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:19,977
[laughter]

679
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:21,078
[imitates l raqi
accent, unintelligible]

680
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,679
Crikey!

681
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,982
[l raqi accent]
What is crikey?
What the hell is crikey?

682
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:28,719
And he's walking
up to him , Hey!
Look over there,

683
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:31,421
lt's an Al-Qaeda member.

684
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,990
An l raqi soldier,

685
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:35,792
one of the most
dangerous creatures
in all the planet.

686
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:39,296
One push of a button
and l'm gone!

687
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,565
l'm gonna poke
him with a stick.

688
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:53,176
[scream]

689
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:54,811
He's angry!

690
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:56,246
[laughter]

691
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,882
l think he's
still angry.

692
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:03,687
Yeah , man , this country,
l love living here in
the United States.

693
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:05,989
l can't think of anywhere
else l'd want to live.

694
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:08,058
Some people say,
Well , you're Mexican .

695
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,193
Wouldn't you rather
live in Mexico?

696
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:11,528
[whistles, shouts]

697
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,230
Uh--[laughs] .

698
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:18,101
l love Mexico,
just visiting ,
just visiting .

699
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:19,870
l like it
right here.

700
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:21,905
That's why it
kind of bothers me
whenever people go,

701
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,074
(female voice)
What is it like
being a Latino comedian?

702
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:28,178
l go, l don't know, l'm
a comedian who happens
to be Latino.

703
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:30,280
(female voice)
What's the difference?

704
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:34,985
The difference is
my special will air on
Comedy Central , not Telemundo.

705
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,253
[cheering]

706
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:44,695
lt's hard , you
guys, you know.

707
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:47,064
Lo español .

708
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:48,999
You speak a little Spanish ,
it freaks people out.

709
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,301
(female)
Oh my God ,
he's speaking Spanish .

710
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:54,638
Don't get me wrong ,
l like watching Spanish
programming myself.

711
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:56,139
Some of the stuff
is really cool .

712
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:58,141
My favorite thing
are the commercials

713
00:32:58,276 --> 00:32:59,943
because they're
always about sex.

714
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:01,745
You don't even know
what the product is

715
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:03,280
until like the
last two seconds.

716
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,649
lt's always some model
walking out all sexy,

717
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:07,651
[rhythmic music beat]

718
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,489
[sexy female voice]
Hola.

719
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:15,592
[rhythmic music beat]

720
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:18,562
[sucks in air]
Ay, què rico.

721
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:19,696
[laughter]

722
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,665
And on the 28th second ,

723
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,034
[shout and short gasp]

724
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,702
Pepsi .

725
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:34,945
And you're sitting there,
going , l gotta go
get a Pepsi .

726
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:39,182
Oh ho yeah !
[laughs]
Oh my God !

727
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,985
l have a thing for soda,
l love it, man .

728
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,353
l know they gave
me water but--

729
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,555
(female voice)
Oh , a soda!

730
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,524
l didn't even see
that right there.

731
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,559
Excuse me,
un momento.

732
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,560
[laughter]

733
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,628
Pepsi .

734
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:54,264
[laughter]

735
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,968
No, that's
actually diet,
which is cool .

736
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:00,037
l'm not on a diet,
and it's funny
because people go,

737
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:01,772
Why then do you
drink diet soda?

738
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:06,643
So l can eat
regular cake.

739
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,146
l love cake, man ,
are you kidding?

740
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,050
By the way, l wanna thank
the three people who brought
me a cake personally.

741
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,818
l have them in the back.
l really appreciate it.

742
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:16,520
That was very nice of you .

743
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:18,622
The management
and the promoters are
freaking out there, like,

744
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:21,658
Gabriel , why do they
all bring you cake?

745
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:25,362
l go, Because on TV
l talked about one time
how much l love cake.

746
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:26,830
And so people bring it.

747
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:28,432
My friend
Mondo got mad ,
He's, like,

748
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:33,336
[Mexican male accent]
Why don't you talk
about hookers?

749
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,572
Somebody asked
me earlier too,
they said , Gabriel ,

750
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:38,375
when you get to do your
special , are you gonna do
anything about the country,

751
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:40,143
are you gonna talk
about politics?

752
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,179
Well , l'm gonna talk
first of all about how
l love this country,

753
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:44,147
and l wouldn't want
to live anywhere else.

754
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:47,050
l know that half the
world right now thinks
that our leader is the devil

755
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:48,552
and most of us would agree.

756
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:49,619
[laughter]

757
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,389
He's not--yeah .

758
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:54,724
l don't have to make
fun of the president.

759
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,193
He does it by himself.

760
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:57,394
Okay?

761
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:58,662
[whistling , clapping]

762
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:01,832
He does it by himself.

763
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:05,569
Every time he comes
on TV, l can't wait
to hear what he has to say.

764
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:07,671
Especially during
press conferences,

765
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:10,340
(high-pitched female voice)
M r. President. Question .

766
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:14,878
lt's been over a year.
What is your plan
for Katrina?

767
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,514
[imitates Bush's voice]
Ha! We're gonna find her.

768
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:18,849
[laughter]

769
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:20,150
That's right.

770
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,586
And we're gonna bring
Katrina to justice.

771
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,557
We have every reason
to believe Katrina
is connected to Al-Qaeda.

772
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:31,528
Qaeda, Katrina,
they both start
with a "k."

773
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:34,698
Our president got elected .
I didn'.t vote for him ,

774
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:37,134
but then again ,
l didn't vote for
the other guy either.

775
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:38,668
l was just, like--.

776
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,337
How Bush won
is beyond me.

777
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,607
Americans, we love to
vote but we don't vote
for Presidents.

778
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:47,911
We vote for things like
American IdoI.

779
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:50,747
Because that's fun.
Voting for presidents
is not fun.

780
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:55,051
Voting for American--
Shebang ! Shebang !

781
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,420
That's what
they should do
for presidents.

782
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:59,489
Just put both guys
on TV for one hour,

783
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:04,027
call it something catchy
like "Who's Gonna Run
This Bitch?"

784
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,164
You put 'em on TV for an hour,
let 'em argue 30 minutes
into the special ,

785
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:10,534
you put an 800 number
on the screen , and
say "Cast Your Vote."

786
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:14,671
[phone rings, click]
You've reached the
presidential hotline.

787
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:16,573
For George Bush ,
press three.

788
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:18,275
John Kerry,
press four.

789
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:20,010
Other options,
press five.

790
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:22,012
You don't like
either one?
Press five.

791
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:23,680
[beep]
Please hold .

792
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:26,416
[high-pitched voice
hums U .S . national anthem]

793
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:33,890
[rings and clicks]

794
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,860
[imitates Clinton]
[chuckles] l knew
you'd be back.

795
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:47,070
That's right. You know
you miss your daddy.

796
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,546
Oh , yeah .
l'm such a dork.
l don't care.

797
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:57,914
But l have fun though .

798
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,050
One thing you
guys definitely
made possible

799
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:02,986
is l have the ability
now to travel and l
never did that.

800
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,155
l never used to travel
until l became a comedian .

801
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:07,691
l'm , like, Oh my God , there's
a whole other world out there.

802
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:09,626
When l was hanging
out in Florida,

803
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,963
l got a chance to experience
an amusement park that was
a little different.

804
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:17,100
lt was an alternative park
called Gatorland .

805
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,169
lt's a real park,
and l've met
the owners

806
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,504
and they're really
cool people but l
gotta tell you :

807
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,240
best part about
this amusement park

808
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:26,309
is they have a recording
the funniest thing l've
ever heard .

809
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:28,011
You call this park,
this is what you hear.

810
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:31,414
[phone rings and clicks]
(male voice, Southern accent)
Yeehaw!

811
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:34,918
You've reached Gatorland ,
America's premier
gator extravaganza.

812
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:38,154
You've seen 'em on TV, now
come and see 'em live.
Gatorland .

813
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:40,423
You're gonna love this park.

814
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:41,858
Then he says this:

815
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,893
Fer Spanish ,
press two.

816
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:44,961
[laughter]

817
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,531
Oh . l gotta hear this.

818
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:52,469
[beep]
l don't speak Spanish but
you're gonna love this park.

819
00:37:57,642 --> 00:38:00,844
l was dyin'!
l called him
like ten times.

820
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:02,879
Aw, it's the best.

821
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:06,016
l'm starting to sweat
a little bit, huh .
Too sexy, arrr.

822
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,318
l don't care though ,
l have a lot of
fun , you guys.

823
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,353
You guys have made
a lot of things possible.

824
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:12,489
At the beginning ,
when l first started ,

825
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,325
coming here to Bakersfield ,
to the Fox Theater,

826
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,128
l used to go to
this taco place,

827
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:19,596
up the way
called Taco Loco--

828
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:23,066
[cheering and whistling]

829
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,169
And it's still there.

830
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,139
l love food on wheels,
you know.

831
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:31,174
But this taco place
has taken it to the
next level .

832
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,842
They're really
really good there,

833
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,078
they're not paying
me nothing , l'm just
talking about 'em ,

834
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:37,681
but l go to order
and these guys were
kinda, you know--

835
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,616
the girls were cool
but the guys were mean .

836
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,451
l try to order
some food ,
l'm like--

837
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:42,986
[thuds]
Hello?

838
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,522
And the guy is like,
Què pasò, gordo
wha' you want?

839
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,123
Wha' you want??

840
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,092
Oh , hey, dude,
can l get two tacos,
chicken and a Coke?

841
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:50,994
Okay. What else?

842
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:53,363
[laughter]

843
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,431
That's it.

844
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:55,565
Tsk, awww.

845
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:05,408
Whatever, dude.

846
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:06,976
But we had
a lot of fun .

847
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:08,611
We got to
promote on a lot of
different radio stations

848
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:10,980
here in town to get the word
out to you guys about the show.

849
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:14,184
They try to get me set up
on the Spanish radio stations

850
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:16,953
and l've done
that in the past

851
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:18,288
and it was okay.

852
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:20,156
But the last few times
l had to say no

853
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:24,060
because they put me on the
radio with a guy who's
like "from" Mexico.

854
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,729
And l can speak Spanish

855
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:29,332
but you put me up against
somebody from the
Motherland , hoo!

856
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:32,502
l walk in the studio,
l'm dealing with this
one guy, right?

857
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:33,970
We go on the air
and he's like

858
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:36,072
[speaks rapid-fire Spanish]

859
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,844
Que paso!
que paso!
que paso!

860
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:44,547
l meet that same guy
in the hallway,

861
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,883
he sounded just like that.

862
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:47,951
Oh , hey,
how's it goin'?

863
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:49,252
Que paso? !

864
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:52,188
Are we on the air?

865
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:54,924
No! !

866
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,226
Why are you
talking like that?

867
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,994
Porque si ! !

868
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,029
And l freaked out
'cause you imagine
this guy

869
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,332
goes home talking like that
to his wife and his kids?

870
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,100
Come two, three o'clock
in the morning ,

871
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,269
his wife maybe wants
to do a little "something"

872
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,138
and she tells her man ,
[female Mexican accent]
Honey, tonight,

873
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:10,206
when the kids are sleeping ,
what are you going to
do to me?

874
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:11,674
Que me vas a hacer?

875
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:15,779
[speaks rapid-fire Spanish]

876
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:20,016
Quitarte los calzones
para ver ese cuuulote!

877
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:26,356
Si . [whoosh]
Si . [whoosh]
Si . [whoosh] Si .

878
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:29,959
[unintelligible] està

S ì [whoosh] .

879
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:38,101
l know somebody who doesn't
speak Spanish is gonna go
home and try it tonight.

880
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:39,636
S ì. [whoosh]

881
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,572
(high-pitched female]
You better stop that.

882
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:46,709
S ì. [whoosh] .

883
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:50,480
Just have a little fun .

884
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,550
Like l said , you guys,
l wasn't sure what was
gonna happen .

885
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:56,152
A lot of things
have been happening
over the years.

886
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,087
This past year l had
the opportunity

887
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:01,724
to be on a reality show and
things kind of worked
out a little weird .

888
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:05,195
Well , but hey, all l can say
is the winner is the winner,

889
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,464
and he did what he did ,
and he got what he got.

890
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:11,901
But hey, this ain't bad
for sixth place,
is it? Huh?

891
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:15,772
[cheers
and whistling]

892
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:19,876
Yeah , l'm
not the last
comic standing ,

893
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:23,413
but l'm the only one with
a Comedy Central Special .
[laughs] .

894
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,390
l know my mom is
here tonight.

895
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:38,828
She's like--
[speaks Spanish] .

896
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:41,498
l love my mom . She's
over here, you guys.
Just say hi to her.

897
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,599
Mom .

898
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:46,302
[cheering and clapping]

899
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:49,839
Right there.

900
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:53,276
That little
woman made me.

901
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:57,080
And she tells everybody,
(high-pitched female)
No, he came out of here.

902
00:41:57,214 --> 00:42:03,486
Ay, hombre, this is
the road to success.

903
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:05,822
She is not shy.
She cracks me up
though , man .

904
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:08,157
She likes what l do
because it's working ,

905
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,026
but she still doesn't
get the jokes.

906
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,661
lt's not that she
doesn't speak English ,

907
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:13,129
'cause she speaks
perfect English .

908
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:15,131
She just doesn't
see me as a comedian .

909
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,100
She sees me as her son .

910
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:20,370
l can't tell her a joke
'cause then she questions
it and kills it.

911
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:23,573
l could tell her something ,
like, Mom , why did the chicken
cross the road?

912
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,776
And l'll get,
(high-pitched female)
Who let out the chicken?

913
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:32,782
lt's a joke.

914
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:35,518
lt's no joke, baboso,
you know how much l pay
for those chickens?

915
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:41,457
Never mind .

916
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:43,293
No, you never mind .

917
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:45,828
lt's cool , though , man .

918
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:47,730
She's seen me do
a lot of things.

919
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:50,934
A lot of people say, well ,
you gave your mom a shot,
what about your dad?

920
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,468
Well , he's not
in the picture.

921
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:55,138
My father, um , ha,

922
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:58,775
let's put
some beans out there,
my father was a mariachi .

923
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:02,011
Way--l swear to God--he was
one of those straight-up
you know,

924
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:04,147
[ra-ta-ta-ta]

925
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:08,051
And my mom hooked up
with him about 30-plus
years ago one night,

926
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:11,087
and nine months later,
tan-tan , and l came out--

927
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:13,957
[laughter]

928
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,858
So l have a vague memory
of my father.

929
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:18,328
l knew him until
l was about maybe
four years old .

930
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:20,763
And then apparently
they got the band
back together

931
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:21,831
and he took off.

932
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:24,434
[laughter]

933
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:26,769
l don't remember exactly
what he looks like,

934
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:28,738
and sometimes
l'll take my mom
out to dinner

935
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:33,743
and l'll go, Mom , l don't mean
to bug you about this, what
does he look like?

936
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:36,312
Do you have
any photos l can get
and idea and stuff?

937
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,548
And my mom , she's funny,
she grabs a hot sauce.

938
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:40,617
[high-pitched female]
He looks like that.

939
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:50,693
That's funny, verdad?
Eso està funny, verdad?
[laughs and screeches]

940
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:53,329
He look just like that.

941
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,164
For those of you
that don't know,

942
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:59,569
there's a picture
of a mariachi on the
bottle of hot sauce.

943
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:02,305
So, yeah ,
we're doing okay.

944
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:04,741
Somebody asked me,
they say, Well , on
your first special

945
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,976
that you got to do, you kept
talking about this guy,

946
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:08,845
this friend of yours
named Felipe.

947
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,780
ls he a real person?

948
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:12,749
He is a real person .

949
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:16,619
And he's an old friend .
Known him forever.

950
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:20,356
But he's one of these comedians
who doesn't know when to stop
being funny.

951
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,159
And that's
why it's hard sometimes
to hang out with the guy,

952
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:25,161
'cause you know,
l know when to quit.

953
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:30,700
Especially around cops,
when l hear [gun cocks]
the joke is over.

954
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,903
lf l hear [siren]
you get an apology.

955
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:36,072
My friend didn't know
when to draw the line

956
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:39,008
and we were hanging out
one day and sure enough
a freakin' cop got mad ,

957
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:41,244
(deep male voice)
Oh , you think it's
real funny, huh?

958
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:44,180
You think it's easy to
be a police officer?
You see that scar?

959
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:46,049
l got stabbed in '92 .

960
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,950
See that?
Bullet wound , '96 .

961
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:49,452
What do you got
to say about that?

962
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:51,187
And l was, like,
l have nothin' to
say about that.

963
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:53,122
And my friend , Felipe,
is, like, Oh , yeah?

964
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:54,357
What are you doin'?

965
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:55,625
Fool , watch this.

966
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:57,660
[screech]
What are you doin'?

967
00:44:57,795 --> 00:45:00,196
He grabs my shirt,
pulls it up, tells
the cop,

968
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,466
Fool , you see those
stretch marks?

969
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,702
Doughnuts, 1 996 .

970
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,541
l said , Dude,
he's gonna kill us.

971
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:15,144
l know, fool ,
but it was funny, huh?

972
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:17,780
And speaking of that,
l get pulled over by
a cop one night,

973
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:21,918
two minutes after coming
out of a Krispy Kreme
drive-thru . Alright?

974
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,754
Don't get ahead of me,
watch , l made a left turn
instead of making a right

975
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:25,988
but l wasn't
paying attention

976
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:27,623
'cause l had a box,
l was, like,

977
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:30,593
[gasp]
Oh , you're gonna get
it when you get home!

978
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,962
Oh , you've
been so bad .

979
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:36,232
So--[female screech]
you're gonna get it.

980
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:39,102
l'm not paying attention ,
l go the wrong way, right?

981
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,170
[rrr]

982
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:42,872
Sure enough--
[siren]

983
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:44,040
[shout]
Ohhh !

984
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,209
l pull over.
[rrr and screech]

985
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:48,845
M m .

986
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:51,414
Later.

987
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:53,716
[ba-ba-ba]

988
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:57,153
l'm sitting there
patiently waiting and
the cop is taking forever.

989
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:59,689
l said ,
The hell with this,
he's taking too long .

990
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:01,657
l grab my box,
l put it on my lap,

991
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:04,527
l flipped it open ,
right? And--[mmmm]

992
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:07,130
[lascivious chuckle]

993
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:11,134
[mmm]
[high-pitched screeches]

994
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,970
Oh , l was gonna get nasty.

995
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:15,805
And just as l was
about to tear it up,

996
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,174
the cop gets to the window
and says the same thing

997
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:19,609
that they all say, right?

998
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:21,577
[deep male voice]
You know why
l stopped you?

999
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:23,012
lt was too easy.

1000
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:24,447
l looked at him
and l said ,

1001
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:26,149
'Cause you can smell it.

1002
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:39,128
Oh , he was dying ,
[deep male]
Son of a bitch !

1003
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:42,732
Whatever, he let me go, man .

1004
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:44,133
So you just gotta be careful .

1005
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:47,336
lf you can make a cop laugh ,
you got a chance.

1006
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,206
This past year,
l got to experience
something else.

1007
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,975
l experienced
my first Raider game.

1008
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:58,381
[loud cheering ,
clapping , booing]

1009
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:02,018
Now, uh--

1010
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,120
hey, listen you guys,

1011
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:07,023
it takes a lot of nerve
for me to say

1012
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:11,093
that after the season
that happened last year

1013
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:14,463
that l'm a fan .
And l became a
fan last year.

1014
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:18,067
[cheering
and whistling]

1015
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:20,002
You can hate it
if you want, but
you know what?

1016
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:21,938
Not only did
l become a fan ,

1017
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:24,207
l did a show
in Oakland .

1018
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:28,110
And l made a couple of
jokes and references
about the team .

1019
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:31,547
And apparently there
were two players
in the audience.

1020
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,150
l didn't know that.

1021
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:39,522
Maybe that's why they
lost. They shoulda been
at home, practicing .

1022
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:41,624
But there were two there.

1023
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:43,426
And they
confronted me outside.

1024
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,562
They were big guys like so,
You got a problem with
the Raiders, son?

1025
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,398
l'm , like,
[screech]

1026
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,701
They grabbed me,
picked me up,

1027
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:53,903
and pinned me
against the wall .

1028
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,005
Oh , my God .

1029
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:58,174
Luckily, they fumbled
me and l got away.

1030
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:14,323
And people go,
How do you come up with
your material , Gabriel?

1031
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,559
How do you come
up with the things
you're gonna say?

1032
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:20,763
Things happen to me and
then instead of just
going to a shrink,

1033
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,365
l suck it up
and l come up here

1034
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:25,234
like when l
did the joke about
the freakin' Volkswagen ,

1035
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:28,537
l really used to
own a Volkswagen .

1036
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:30,907
l didn't just go,
Let me see if
this is funny.

1037
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:33,709
l had a Volkswagen .

1038
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:35,111
No, l lived it.

1039
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,312
People go, Why
do you wear
Hawaiian shirts?

1040
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:37,880
l've always worn
Hawaiian shirts.

1041
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:39,215
Bottom line is simple.

1042
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:40,283
Why do l wear 'em?

1043
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:43,219
'Cause they fit.

1044
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:44,954
They're colorful ,
and l'm sorry--

1045
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,990
When you wear a Hawaiian
shirt and you're living
in the ghetto,

1046
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:50,293
people don't think
you're up to no good .

1047
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,495
You're not a gang member
wearing a Hawaiian shirt.

1048
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:54,964
Nobody's gonna take
you serious, you know?

1049
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,732
[deep black male]
Where you from?

1050
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:59,135
[male Hawaiian accent]
Oh , Honolulu , eh .

1051
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,570
[laughter]

1052
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:06,575
You can't be hard
and colorful .
[laughs] Uh-uh .

1053
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,413
No way, man .

1054
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:12,248
And believe me,
l've had my encounters.

1055
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:13,983
l had a little encounter
one time on a plane.

1056
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,718
Some guy was getting
a little weird ,

1057
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:17,553
and l'm like,
Uh-uh , no more for me.

1058
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:20,790
Every time l get
on a plane, there's
always drama. Always.

1059
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:26,696
One time l'm flying to Florida
and our plane got hit
by lightning . Uh-huh .

1060
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:30,299
The plane drops 600
feet [whoosh]
straight down .

1061
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:33,669
That was better than
any ride you've ever
been on .

1062
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,638
l don't care
who you are,

1063
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:38,240
you could've been freakin'
doin' 20 years in prison ,

1064
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,309
you killed a hundred people,

1065
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:42,578
you can be the baddest
toughest dude ever.

1066
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:45,815
When you're in a plane
and it just drops
out of the sky,

1067
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:51,988
[gasps] Woo!
l was gay for
five seconds.

1068
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:56,926
l'm not gonna lie!
[screeches]

1069
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,161
[weeping]

1070
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:01,197
[screech]

1071
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,970
Oh , l was a brokeback
Mexican , yes, l was.

1072
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:15,811
l was in touch
with myself.

1073
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:19,215
lt was funny, man .

1074
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:22,451
Before l go,
l got one more good
story to tell you .

1075
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:24,387
l took a road trip
about a year ago

1076
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,422
after l got rid
of the Beetle

1077
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:29,792
in the SUV. Took a
road trip from LA
to Phoenix

1078
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:31,460
to go perform
at this club.

1079
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:33,229
Let me tell you
who was in the car.

1080
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:36,032
l'm driving ,
l got my buddy
Armando riding shotgun .

1081
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:39,068
He's another Fluffy guy,
we call him Sexy Bitch .

1082
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,437
Well , l don't call
him that, his wife
calls him that.

1083
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:43,773
[high-pitched
Mexican female]
He's a sexy bitch !

1084
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:46,242
Anyway, in the back seat
l got my friend , Martin .

1085
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,344
Next to him is
my friend , Felipe.

1086
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:51,180
So we take off--
[rrr]

1087
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:54,583
we're on the 1 0 freeway,
we're passing all these
l ndian casinos--

1088
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:57,386
[rrr]
[whoops l ndian style] .

1089
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:59,155
Sorry, we're
stupid like that.

1090
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:02,358
Anyway, all of a sudden
all these cars start
passing me.

1091
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:04,627
[rrr rrr rrr]

1092
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:07,797
l'm getting annoyed
'cause l'm driving
a [loud truck horn] .

1093
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:10,566
l said , Next car
that tries to pass me,
l'm not gonna let 'em .

1094
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,769
So l'm looking in the
rear view mirror, waiting ,
looking , waiting , waiting ,

1095
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,038
and l see a silver dot.
The silver dot turned out
to be

1096
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:19,408
a little car
with two hoochies in it.

1097
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:21,877
Some of you guys
are going , How do
you know they're hoochies?

1098
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:24,547
'Cause my friend
Martin was in the
back seat going ,

1099
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:28,551
l feel a disturbance
in the force.

1100
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:31,520
They try to go around
and l cut 'em off.
[rrr]

1101
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:33,789
[high-pitched laughter]

1102
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,492
l'm having fun ,
they're back there--
[light honk] .

1103
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,394
Whatever!
[truck honk]

1104
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:40,996
My friend Felipe is
in the back seat
yelling at me,

1105
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:42,698
[male Mexican accent]
Fool , what
are you doing?

1106
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:44,300
Dude, don't worry,
l'm having fun .

1107
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:45,634
Gabriel , you're
gonna get pulled over.

1108
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:46,969
Dude, l'm okay,
it's cool .

1109
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,637
We're arguing ,
going back and forth ,

1110
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,439
l'm not paying attention .

1111
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:54,076
l don't see a California
highway patrol officer
creeping up on us.

1112
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:56,378
All of a sudden
l hear--[siren] .

1113
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:59,315
l look at the
speedometer: one oh two.

1114
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:00,483
[audience ohhhs]

1115
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:01,750
Oh , l freaked out.
[screeches] .

1116
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:04,520
l pulled over.
[rrrrrrr]

1117
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:07,523
[braking sound]
[psssssst]

1118
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:10,392
The little car
that was behind me
with the two hoochies,

1119
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:13,062
they got pulled over
because they were
going just as fast,

1120
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:14,130
[rrr and squeak]

1121
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:15,664
[laughter]

1122
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,399
l'm in the front seat
of my car, freakin' out.

1123
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:19,368
Oh my God ,
l'm gonna go
to jail .

1124
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:21,070
l'm on the verge of tears.

1125
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:23,539
From the back seat,
l hear my friend Felipe--

1126
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:26,041
Fool , what
are you cryin' for?

1127
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:27,676
What are you
cryin' for, fool?

1128
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,346
You're not the one
with weed in his
pocket, are you?

1129
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:38,921
You have drugs
in the car?

1130
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:42,191
l told you to slow
down , didn't l?

1131
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:47,363
But no! Picachu
knows everything .

1132
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:50,232
Shoot! Everybody
roll down your windows.
[frrr frrr]

1133
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:52,835
Air out the car.
Mondo, fart.
Do something , man .

1134
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,270
The cop walks
over to the window,

1135
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:57,840
looks in , sees my face,
recognizes me from TV,

1136
00:52:57,974 --> 00:53:05,014
he's, like, Hey,
l know you , you're
a comedian .

1137
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:07,249
Yeah , you're that guy
from Comedy Central .

1138
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:09,552
You're the guy that does that
joke about his friend at
a hotel

1139
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,987
and you crank-call him
and you call him a
dirty Mexican ,

1140
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:14,023
and then you go
"But it was funny, huh?"

1141
00:53:14,157 --> 00:53:16,325
Oh , l love that joke.
That one and when you go,

1142
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:18,460
[high-pitched female]
Chocolate cake!

1143
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:20,029
Ohh , l love that joke!

1144
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:21,964
l hate to do this
to you but we got
two cars involved .

1145
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:23,866
l need your license
and registration .

1146
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,668
Okay, here you go.
Here you go.

1147
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:28,904
So he takes my info,
goes back to the car
with the two girls in it,

1148
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,440
the whole time he's back
there, l tell everybody
in the car,

1149
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:33,842
Check it out! He
just recognized
me from TV!

1150
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:36,512
Maybe if we have some
fun with him , crack
some jokes,

1151
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:38,380
maybe he won't
take the car.

1152
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:40,382
l don't care if l get
a ticket, but as long as
he doesn't take the car.

1153
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:42,084
Mondo, be silly,
crack a joke.
Martin , be funny.

1154
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,752
Felipe.
[deep voice]
What, fool?

1155
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,854
Shut the hell up!

1156
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:49,325
So the cop comes back
to the car, What the hell
were you doing out there?

1157
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:51,493
Before l could think
of something funny
to say,

1158
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:52,928
from the back
seat l hear,

1159
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:58,067
Fool , he was testing
the suspension .

1160
00:53:58,201 --> 00:54:01,470
Oh , my God . This
pothead's gonna get
me arrested .

1161
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:03,372
Officer, l'm sorry,
that's my friend , Felipe,

1162
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:04,907
that's the guy from
the special ,

1163
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,742
the guy who
says "But it
was funny, huh?"

1164
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:08,911
He's just trying
to get me in trouble.
l'm really sorry.

1165
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:10,546
Whatever.

1166
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,481
So he goes back to his
squad car with my
driver's license,

1167
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:14,516
and he's swiping it
in a computer.

1168
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:20,122
The whole time he's doing
that, he's being yelled at
from the back seat of my car.

1169
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:23,692
Hey, officer, thank
God you have a computer!

1170
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:29,198
Last week we got stopped
in Mexico, that fool had
a Rolodex.

1171
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:32,434
The cop starts dying .
[laughs with screech]

1172
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:34,236
l go, Oh , we
got him going ,
we got him going .

1173
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:36,171
l told my buddy
Mondo, Give me my CDs.

1174
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:38,540
l take out my
Bad Boys II soundtrack,

1175
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:42,111
and l pop it in , track three
is the theme song to Cops.

1176
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:45,281
l tell my friend , Felipe,
Tell me when the cop
starts walking .

1177
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:47,016
Okay, fool ,
here he comes.

1178
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:51,387
l crank that song
as loud as l could .
[static and beep]

1179
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:58,627
Ha! Bad boys,
what you , what you ,
what you gonna do.

1180
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:04,500
[imitates beat music]

1181
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:07,536
Best part, now the cop
is walking to the beat.

1182
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:14,109
[beat music]

1183
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:16,712
Even better than that,
the two hoochies in
the car

1184
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:19,081
can hear the music
and they're freakin' out.

1185
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:24,453
They're, like, [high-pitched]
Oh my God , we're gonna
be on TV!

1186
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:27,523
The cop goes to the girls,
gives them a ticket,
lets them go.

1187
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,558
[rrrrr]

1188
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:33,429
Looks at our car
and at this point, we're
halfway through the song ,

1189
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:36,398
we're, like,
[sings reggae]

1190
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:38,400
♫ Police no give
Me no break ♫

1191
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:39,935
[unintelligible]

1192
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:49,278
Got our arms
out the window
like a bunch of idiots.

1193
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:51,714
The cop is in the middle
of the freeway, dying .

1194
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,082
[screech and laugh]

1195
00:55:53,216 --> 00:55:54,883
He walks over
to the window
and he's like,

1196
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:55,951
Shut it off!

1197
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:57,252
[screech]
[click]

1198
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,858
Yes, sir.

1199
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:05,961
Hands me my license
and the registration ,
and he tells me,

1200
00:56:06,096 --> 00:56:09,198
Gabriel , l want you
to do me a big favor,

1201
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:11,934
l want you to keep this
tank under a hundred .

1202
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:14,036
You think you can do that?

1203
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:16,038
Uh-huh .

1204
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:17,339
Do that for me,

1205
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:18,941
keep on doing
what you do,

1206
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:20,843
and you have
yourself a nice day.

1207
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:23,312
But, but, that's it?

1208
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:24,747
No ticket?

1209
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,382
No ticket.

1210
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:28,851
l don't know what
possessed me to look
at this man

1211
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:30,452
and go, Why?

1212
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:33,522
[laughter]

1213
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:36,125
How come the girls
got a ticket?

1214
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:37,893
And he tells me
the coolest thing ,

1215
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:40,829
he says,
'Cause they couldn't
make me laugh .

1216
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:50,806
[laughter]
[cheering]

1217
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,574
Woo-whee!

1218
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:54,343
You don't
understand , Gabriel ,

1219
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:57,079
l've been on the force
now for 26 years.

1220
00:56:57,213 --> 00:57:01,850
This is hands-down the funniest
damn traffic stop l've ever
been a part of.

1221
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:04,953
Do you have any idea
how hard it is to
give two sluts

1222
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:08,490
a ticket while
listening to Cops?

1223
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:11,927
l damn near
pissed myself l
was laughing so hard .

1224
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:14,696
This is going in the books
as one of the funniest things

1225
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:17,466
that ever happened
to a police officer,
l swear to God .

1226
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,834
The only story better
than this one

1227
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:20,969
is a buddy of mine
pulled over some fat guy

1228
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,404
that gave him doughnuts.

1229
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:39,021
So he starts walking away,
and just as l'm about
to start the car,

1230
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:45,327
So does that mean
l can keep my weed?

1231
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:49,064
[laughter]

1232
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:50,599
l turn around to yell
at my friend ,

1233
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:52,734
Too late, the cop
is at the window,

1234
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:55,103
You wanna run that
by me again , son?

1235
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:57,906
You heard what
l said , fool .

1236
00:57:58,041 --> 00:57:59,975
Oh , you think
this a big joke,
don't you?

1237
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:02,344
You think that just
because l gave your
buddy here a break,

1238
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,879
l know who he is,
l like what he does,

1239
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:05,747
l don't know you ,
l don't like you .

1240
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:08,083
Step out of the car.

1241
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:10,319
l turn around and
my friend Felipe
is, like,

1242
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:14,189
Whooo. l
am so scared .

1243
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:17,693
And the cop pulls
out his gun ,
[cocks gun]

1244
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:19,595
l'm freakin' out,
Oh my God !

1245
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:21,530
Back seat, my
friend , Felipe:

1246
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:26,335
Whooo. Whooo.
l am so scared .

1247
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:28,904
Fool , he is good .
He is good .

1248
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:31,173
Then he points
it at him .

1249
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:34,243
The look on my
friend Felipe's face,

1250
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:40,215
[gasp]
[whispers]
Priceless!

1251
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:44,820
Are you serious?
Are you serious?

1252
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:48,423
l'm a-go to jail?

1253
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:49,992
The cop was like
[cocks gun]--

1254
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:53,462
Nah , but that
was funny, huh?

1255
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:59,101
l love you , Bakersfield !
Thank you !

1256
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:01,537
[curtain music]

1257
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:02,391
(Martin)
We're gonna bring

1258
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:04,026
Gabriel back out to
answer some questions
for you .

1259
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,061
You guys wanna
bring Gabriel
back out?

1260
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:10,432
[wild cheering]

1261
01:01:10,566 --> 01:01:15,037
Ladies and gentlemen ,
coming back to the stage,
Gabriel lglesias.

1262
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:23,345
Thank you , Martin .

1263
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:25,747
You pulled it off
bro, congratulations.

1264
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:29,317
l needed that
the first time l--
well , never mind .

1265
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:33,121
They want to
ask you some
questions, uh ,

1266
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:34,690
Who we got first?

1267
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:36,358
This is a little
different something
we decided to do

1268
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:40,362
because there's gonna
be a DVD release with
special features

1269
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:42,864
we figured why not,
sometimes people do things

1270
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:45,467
and sometimes people
wanna know information

1271
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:48,503
and rather than
go on the l nternet,
you can ask the source.

1272
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:50,439
So, here's you
guys' opportunity,

1273
01:01:50,573 --> 01:01:52,841
anything you
guys wanna ask
me, go for it.

1274
01:01:52,975 --> 01:01:53,909
What's your
name, homey?

1275
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,243
My name is Danny.

1276
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:56,545
Where you from?

1277
01:01:56,679 --> 01:01:58,313
Visalia, California.

1278
01:01:58,448 --> 01:01:59,815
Visalia in
the house!

1279
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:01,183
Go ahead , Danny.

1280
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:03,385
This past summer l
got on a rollercoaster,

1281
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,287
when l sat down ,
it went click,
click, click.

1282
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:07,022
How many'd you get?

1283
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:10,726
Dude, l'm beyond clicks
now. l don't even get on .

1284
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:13,295
Like six years ago, bro,
l could still go
to Disneyland ,

1285
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:17,999
and lean on--[grrr] .
Now, l'm older, l hang
out by the strollers.

1286
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,404
What's your
question , Patricia?

1287
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:25,273
How does your family
feel about your success?

1288
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:28,643
Um , some of the family
thinks that l'm doing
pretty good .

1289
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:31,446
My mom is happy
'cause she's got a
car and it's paid for.

1290
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:33,281
[laughter]

1291
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,250
There are some members
of the family that think
l've gone Hollywood ,

1292
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:37,385
and l'm like, Okay.

1293
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,187
Some of the family
members are really
cool about it,

1294
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:41,790
and some are just
kinda you know, hmmm .

1295
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:44,226
l love them all ,
but, you know,
hey, whatever.

1296
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,894
Not everybody
can get a check.

1297
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:47,395
[laughter]

1298
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:49,297
Hey, how you doin'?

1299
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:50,432
What's your name?

1300
01:02:50,566 --> 01:02:51,733
(Gabriel)
JuIia!

1301
01:02:51,868 --> 01:02:52,968
I know JuIia.

1302
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:54,436
You guys go back, eh?

1303
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:56,605
Way back.

1304
01:02:56,739 --> 01:02:57,706
Like that?

1305
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:58,907
Like that.

1306
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:00,742
My question
is to you ,

1307
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:03,311
l know you're making
fun of me for having the
runs and going to pee,

1308
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:06,148
and l know you have
a girlfriend , l saw
her, very pretty,

1309
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,517
but will you
please marry me,
my fluffy bunny?

1310
01:03:08,651 --> 01:03:10,352
[audience goes oh !]

1311
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:13,255
"Fluffy bunny?"

1312
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:14,956
Wow.

1313
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:17,893
Girl , my girlfriend's
gonna jump you and
my mom's gonna help.

1314
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:25,667
Take one for the team.

1315
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,035
Thank you , though .

1316
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:28,236
Bye, now.

1317

01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:33,875
Yeah .
Què pasò.

01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:35,443
How you

1321
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:37,646
Who's your favorite
stand-up and have
you ever met him?

1322
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:39,581
My favorite stand-up
comic, Robin WiIIiams,

1323
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:41,283
and l met him
last year.

1324
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:42,317
[audience cheers]

1325
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:44,486
Yeah .
Thank you , man .

1326
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:47,622
What l was curious about
is how you come up
with your material .

1327
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:49,491
How do l come
up with material?

1328
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:51,092
Uh , some people
have writers,

1329
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:52,861


some comics
are writers,

1330
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,496
l don't know how
to sit down and
come up with funny stuff

1331
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:56,398
and then come out
here and try
to perform it.

1332
01:03:56,532 --> 01:03:57,999
l usually react
to things that
are happening ,

1333
01:03:58,134 --> 01:04:01,937
like people getting
up, walking to the
bathroom , baboso.

1334
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:04,639
And it's still
the same guy, too.

1335
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:06,575
Things happen to me
on a daily basis,
and l find a way

1336
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:08,743
to make
them funny, like,
for example,

1337
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:11,847
sometimes at night,
when l go to a drive-thru
and they mess me up,

1338
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:15,217
l like to go back in line
again , and mess with them .

1339
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:16,685
Like when they come
on the speaker,

1340
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:18,486
WeIcome to McDonaId'.s,
how can l help you?

1341
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:20,255
l'll just start messing
with them . l'll do like
a girl voice and go,

1342
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:23,225
Oh my God , hi !
[laughs]

1343
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:24,693
You don't just
write that,

1344
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:26,061
it's kind of
a spur of the
moment type of thing .

1345
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:27,896
Then l come up here
and tell the story.

1346
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:30,866
Everything you hear me talk
about on the shows is usually
a real story.

1347
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,801
How are you
handling success?

1348
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:34,002
How am l handling it?

1349
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:37,205
l'll let you know
when this airs.

1350
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:39,307
l'll let you know
when the DVDs come out

1351
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:41,843
to see if I
hang [unintelligible].

1352
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:44,012
Honestly, bro,

1353
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:46,281
l don't know how
you would say how
you're handling it,

1354
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:47,849
l don't forget
where l'm from ,

1355
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:50,385
that's exactly why
l wanted to do the
special here

1356
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:54,823
because it was a--
1 0 years later type
of thing .

1357
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:56,758
l still have
my original
best friend

1358
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:59,327
from way back
in the day when l
didn't have comedy.

1359
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:01,796
When l would go spend
Christmas at his house.

1360
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:04,165
And l have
people that love
me and care about me

1361
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,301
whether this happens
or doesn't happen .

1362
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:09,104
My brother will still
let me sleep on
his porch .

1363
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:10,238
So, it's going
good , man .

1364
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:11,206
Stay true to
your roots.

1365
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:13,141
Thank you , bro.

1366
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:16,745
Ladies and gentlemen ,
this is a guy by the
name of Fast Freddy.

1367
01:05:16,879 --> 01:05:21,116
Fast Freddy has
been coming out
to see my shows

1368
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,351
for what, a good
three, four years?

1369
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:26,354
2000 you opened up
for Weird Al Yankovic
in San Diego.

1370
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:28,924
What year was that?

1371
01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:30,425
Two thousand .

1372
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:33,962
So for six years,
you have successfully
stalked me.

1373
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:35,697
[laughter]

1374
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:38,300
[high-pitched cries]

1375
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:39,768
And made it
to the special .

1376
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:41,503
This guy right here,
is one of the
greatest fans

1377
01:05:41,637 --> 01:05:43,371
any entertainer
could ever ask for.

1378
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:44,973
And he's just been
a really really nice guy.

1379
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,942
We did a show
in Denver, Colorado,

1380
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:50,478
and he had his
entire family reunion
come to the show.

1381
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:53,348
And any time l said his
name, they're like,

1382
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:58,119
But no, honestly dude,

01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:02,857
and you can burn it, make
copies and give it
to your friends

1385
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:04,926
and sell it
at the Swap-Meet.

1386
01:06:05,061 --> 01:06:07,062
But l really appreciate you
and your wife always coming
out to the shows.

1387
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:08,530
Man , you've shown

Where have been
some of your favorite
places to perform?

but mmm , one of them .

1394
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:25,146

01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:42,030
One of the most interesting

l performed
for Canadians. Eh .

1403
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:48,269
They say "eh" more
than gang members.

1404
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:49,471
How you doin', eh?

1405
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:51,639

l love performing everywhere.

1407
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:55,310
There are some places
that l'd rather
not go back,

1408
01:06:55,444 --> 01:06:57,979
l won't mention them
in case they sell the
CD and DVD there.

1409
01:06:58,114 --> 01:06:59,047
What's your name?

1410
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:00,582
Salvador.

1411
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:03,218
SaIvador! It's Iike
a soap opera name.

1412
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:05,286
(girl voice)
¿ Donde vas?

1413
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:07,789
(male voice)

1414
01:07:07,923 --> 01:07:09,357
Just messin'
with you , bro.

1415
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:12,027
My question is, what's
your mom's favorite dish

1416
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:14,796
that she taught
you how to make
or not?

1417
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:16,664

1418
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:17,966
Yeah.

1419
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,402
Uh , Jack

See, my mom ,
yeah , she's Mexican ,
but she ole school Mexican ,

1422
01:07:24,573 --> 01:07:25,940
she didn't even
wanna cook.

1423
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:27,375
When l was
a little kid ,

1424
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:29,644
my mom would go
play bingo, she
still plays it

1425
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:31,880
and she'd come home
at like one o'clock
at night,

1426
01:07:32,014 --> 01:07:33,048
and l'm like
Mom , l'm hungry.

1427
01:07:33,182 --> 01:07:34,616
(female Mexican accent)
Let's go.

1428
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,284
We'd go hit a
Jack in the Box and
it became a routine.

1429
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:38,620
When l was a little kid ,
l used to be like this,

1430
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:41,890
then , years later,
Jack in the Box.

1431
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:44,826
Mom , what's your
favorite dish?

1432
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,227

Oh , she's getting mad ,

1434
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:51,232
[laughter]

1435
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:52,901
Yeah , 'cause she'd
make 'em once a year
for Christmas

1436
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:54,502
and make me
cook 'em with her,

1437
01:07:54,637 --> 01:07:56,004

1438
01:07:56,138 --> 01:07:58,473
[high-pitched]
Amàrralos!

1439
01:07:58,607 --> 01:08:01,776
l couldn't take a bath
because there's a bunch
of freakin' corn husks

1440
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:04,079
in the tub
because she's
letting them soak.

1441
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:06,114
I smeII Iike cuIo
but she don't care.

1442
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:08,550
[high-pitched]
I have to

1443
01:08:08,684 --> 01:08:10,151

a joke

1449
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:28,903
but it makes me
laugh every time
l say it.

1450
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:35,677
Hey! l actually told

a clean joke,

1451
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:37,479
my very first joke

1452
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:38,847
when l was 1 0 years old ,

1453
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:41,316

1456
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:49,290
l said , Why did the
chicken cross the road?

1457
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:50,592
And the whole crowd
said , Why?

1458
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:53,761
And l said ,
To check out the chicks.

1459
01:08:53,896 --> 01:08:55,363
My name is Philip.

1460
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:57,699

be in one place and
you were at another.

1492

01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:56,317
Maybe they'll cut off
a pound or two.

1513
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:58,019

we need to keep
the white people

1539
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:13,020
distracted from the
Latinos in the house.

1540
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:15,356
l love black folks.
Black guys have
got to be

1541
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:17,458
the coolest
men on the planet.

1542
01:13:17,593 --> 01:13:18,893
You know that?
That's right.

1543
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:21,796
l'll tell you right now.
A black guy could punk

1544
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:23,631
a white guy
into some fashion .

1545
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:26,134
[laughter]

1546
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:30,605
A black guy could show up
wearing a clown suit
talking shit,

1547
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:33,541
it's a clown suit, bitches!

1548
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:35,543

1550
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:42,984
There'd be a white guy behind
him , Holy shit, we gotta get
a clown suit.

1551
01:13:43,118 --> 01:13:45,953
They are cool .
Latinos, we got
it all twisted .

1552
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:49,023
We thought hard work
was gonna do the trick.

1553
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:50,625
lt's hard work
being Latino, right?

1554
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:54,729
You gotta sneak
in through the desert,

1555
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:58,499
get a job without an l D,

1556
01:13:58,634 --> 01:14:01,035
learn how to speak English .

1557
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:03,571
Black folks tried
hard work for
200 years,

1558
01:14:03,705 --> 01:14:06,941
you see where
that shit got them .

1559
01:14:07,075 --> 01:14:09,210
A boat showed
up to Africa,

1560
01:14:09,344 --> 01:14:12,747
it was a messed-up trip
but a boat showed up.

1561
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:18,786
Can you imagine if
a boat showed up
in Mexico?

1562
01:14:18,921 --> 01:14:22,356
Latinos would be
running each other
over, trying to get on .

1563
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:24,492
Vamonos, cabron ,
call your tio,

1564
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:28,696
it's free, let's go!

1565
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:34,368
Shit, you think
we fit a lot of
people in a car?

1566
01:14:34,503 --> 01:14:36,037
Mess around and
give us a boat?

1567
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:41,209
We'll have people hanging
from that anchor,
Take me too!

1568
01:14:41,343 --> 01:14:42,877
Oh , man , l talk
a lot of shit.

1569
01:14:43,011 --> 01:14:44,312
lt looks like we got
a lot of couples
in the house.

1570
01:14:44,446 --> 01:14:46,347
Couples, where you at?
Make some noise, couples.

1571
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:47,782
[much shouting]

1572
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:49,684
Wow.

1573
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:52,587
Better you than me.

1574
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:56,624
l was married one
time, had a traditional
Latino Catholic wedding .

1575
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:59,627
Very traditional .
My girlfriend
was pregnant.

1576
01:14:59,761 --> 01:15:01,629
[laughter]

1577
01:15:01,763 --> 01:15:04,065
My son was
the best man .

1578
01:15:06,068 --> 01:15:08,603
lt was traditional .
l'm not doing it
again though .

1579
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:10,605
And l
knew marriage
wasn't for me,

1580
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:14,041
because at the wedding
they were throwing
minute rice.

1581
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:16,210
l knew it wasn't
gonna last, right?

1582
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:21,415
And my favorite part
out of the whole wedding
thing was the bachelor party.

1583
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:22,817
Are you kidding?

1584
01:15:22,951 --> 01:15:25,486
Free beers,
free lapdances,

1585
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:27,588
that's a good time, right?

1586
01:15:27,723 --> 01:15:30,758
Because strip clubs
are expensive when
you gotta pay, right?

1587
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:33,461
You got a big
ol' cover charge,
you get all mad ,

1588
01:15:33,595 --> 01:15:36,697
l shoulda brought
the Vl P tickets l
got last week.

1589
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:40,201
You walk in ,
beers are eight bucks,

1590
01:15:40,335 --> 01:15:42,637
lapdances are 25 bucks,

1591
01:15:42,771 --> 01:15:45,139
and then they trick you ,
two for one, two for one,

1592
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:47,241
but then
the song's over
in one minute.

1593
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:49,010
What the hell is that?

1594
01:15:49,144 --> 01:15:51,212
Who's doing
the music here?
DJ ComeQuick?

1595
01:15:51,346 --> 01:15:53,047
This is bullshit.
lt's horrible.

1596
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:57,084
That is why l like
strip clubs in Mexico.

1597
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:59,186
That is the
shit right there.

1598
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:00,655
[cheering]

1599
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:02,990
And if you haven't gone,
you owe it to yourselves

1600
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:05,059
to take a vacation ,
just to check it out.

1601
01:16:05,193 --> 01:16:06,494

First of aII, there'.s
no cover charge.

1606
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:18,205
There's a midget
about that big ,

1607
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:21,008
just recruiting people.
He's got horns, whistles,

1608
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:23,644

You walk in ,

Two-dollar beers.
One-dollar shooters.

1611
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:34,822
Lapdances, 25 bucks, but
every lapdance has
a happy ending .

1612
01:16:34,957 --> 01:16:38,159
That is good times.

1613
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:42,730
You have got
to be carefuI at
the Mexican strip clubs.

1614
01:16:42,864 --> 01:16:44,231
The girls look young .

1615
01:16:44,366 --> 01:16:46,167
They're legal ,
but they're barely legal .

1616
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:49,670
lt's like it's gonna
be midnight and they're
like seventeen and a half.

1617

lt's like, alright.

1619
01:16:57,646 --> 01:17:00,615
l'm telling you , one
of these girls didn't

1620
01:17:00,749 --> 01:17:02,750
She had tennis shoes.

1621

She was dancing ,

1622
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:08,456

Alright. There's advantages
to being short, right?

1636
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:53,334
Hell , yeah , l could
get drunk quick.

1637
01:17:53,468 --> 01:17:54,602
Two Bud Lites,
l'm gone.

1638

[laughter]

1639
01:17:56,438 --> 01:17:58,806
There's advantages.
l could stand under
a table

1640
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:02,376
when there's
an earthquake.

1641
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:04,011
l could just stand there.

1642
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:11,085
You guys good over there?
Yeah , l'm good over here.

1643
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:12,720
The bathroom
of the airplane,

1644
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:14,455
l fit in there.
Tall people, you don't
fit in there, huh?

1645
01:18:14,589 --> 01:18:16,323
Your knees are
hittin' the door
like that.

1646
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:19,393
Not me, that's like
my living room , man .
l'm like woo!

1647
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:21,829
This flight
is takin' forever.

1648
01:18:21,963 --> 01:18:23,764
Let me wash my
hands real quick.

1649
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:32,606
One thing that sucks
is that people
always know

1650
01:18:32,741 --> 01:18:35,042
what l am for Halloween .

1651
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:37,778
Tall people,
you can fool
your friends.

1652
01:18:37,913 --> 01:18:40,548
You show up to the
party, everybody's like,
Who's Batman over there?

1653
01:18:40,682 --> 01:18:46,187
l don't know,
but there's Noe
right there.

1654
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:50,758
Last year l dressed
up as King Kong .

1655
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:53,728
My friends came up
to me, Hey, you're
Curious George,

1656
01:18:53,862 --> 01:18:54,962
huh , bro? Come here!

1657
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:04,872
So l was just
watching the movie of
exorcism of Emily Rose.

1658
01:19:05,006 --> 01:19:06,907
Have you seen
that movie?

1659
01:19:07,042 --> 01:19:09,777
That's a scary movie, man ,
because the devil could just
pop into you at any time.

1660
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:11,479
l didn't know
he could do that.

1661
01:19:11,613 --> 01:19:13,681
You know, she was
just walking down
the street,

1662
01:19:13,815 --> 01:19:16,717
How you doin'?
[groans]

1663
01:19:16,852 --> 01:19:18,219
That guy
stayed with her,

1664
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:20,121
(deep male voice)
Honey, l love you ,
l don't care!

1665
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:22,356
[groan]

1666
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:24,024
And then his friends
would get mad ,

1667
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,860
he would take her
to parties, Hey dude,

1668
01:19:25,994 --> 01:19:27,795
your chick is triping
by the punchbowl , look.

1669
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:29,230
[laughter]

1670
01:19:29,364 --> 01:19:32,833
Nobody wants to drink
punch , bro, take her home.

1671
01:19:32,968 --> 01:19:35,803
(deep male voice)
Come on , honey,
let's get out of here.

1672
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:45,379
Only white people get
possessed by the devil .

1673
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:48,783
l've seen the first
two Exorcists movies, guys.

1674
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:51,118
Latinos, we don't get
possessed by the devil

1675
01:19:51,253 --> 01:19:56,690
because our moms
would beat the shit
out of the devil .

1676
01:19:56,825 --> 01:20:00,494
Our mom with el diablo,
[speaks Spanish angrily] .

1677
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:04,832
Traeme el tapatio,
con el tapatìo se
sale el diablo.

1678
01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:06,100
Con el tapatio--

1679
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:09,203
Hijo de la chingada!
[unintelligible] .

1680
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:19,980
Speaking of the devil , l
just broke up with
my girlfriend .

1681
01:20:20,115 --> 01:20:23,417
Sorry about that.

1682
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,619
lt was hard , man ,
because she had cable.

1683
01:20:25,754 --> 01:20:28,956
[laughter]

1684
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:32,827
Man , she has N FL Preview,
maybe l should wait
till February.

1685
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:35,396
We're always fighting .
We got in a fight at
six flags.

1686
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:37,731
We were right there in line
for Superman , the ride.

1687
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:40,568
And there was these cholos
in front of us, playing
around with water guns,

1688
01:20:40,702 --> 01:20:42,503
just shooting each other.
They're [psh psh]

1689
01:20:42,637 --> 01:20:45,206
Go Raiders, hey!
[psh psh]

1690
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:48,776
[laughter]

1691
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:51,378
And some water
started splashing
backward , right?

1692
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:53,714
She says,
l'm getting wet,
do something !

1693
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:55,950
And l saw
they were cholos,
you know what l mean?

1694
01:20:56,084 --> 01:20:57,651
So l was, like,
Take it, bitch !

1695
01:20:57,786 --> 01:21:01,589
[laughter]

1696
01:21:01,723 --> 01:21:07,595
We just got us splashed ,
you got drenched , you
didn't say nothing !

1697
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:10,097
Now you want me to
go do something?

1698
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:13,667
She says, Fine, if l
get wet again , l'm
gonna go do something .

1699
01:21:13,802 --> 01:21:15,336
l go, Oh , shit.

1700
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:17,905
So an hour goes by,
and the cholos they
start playing around

1701
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:19,406
with the water guns--
[psh psh]

1702
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:23,010
and she got wet again ,
(female voice)
That's it!

1703
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:25,713
She ran over there,
she had a full Coke.

1704
01:21:25,847 --> 01:21:29,950
And she threw it on the cholos,
You like getting wet, huh?
You like getting wet?

1705
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:32,086
You like getting wet?

1706
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:35,389
l'm running behind
her going , No! !

1707
01:21:35,523 --> 01:21:37,858
[laughter]

1708
01:21:37,993 --> 01:21:45,032
The cholos were standing there,
all full of Coke, stunned ,
all sticky,

1709
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:47,568
Then they looked at me,
Hey, bro, control
your bitch !

1710
01:21:47,702 --> 01:21:53,073
l was, like, Whoa.
See? l told you
you were a bitch .

1711
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:57,044
Didn't l tell you--?
Hey, bro, l'm not
even with her, dog .

1712
01:21:57,178 --> 01:22:02,750
l don't even know
what l'm doing here,
l can't even get on the rides.

1713
01:22:02,884 --> 01:22:08,856
Go, Raiders.

1714
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:11,358
So l just turned 30
like 4 years ago.

1715
01:22:11,493 --> 01:22:14,628
All my friends pitched
in , they gave me a Harley
Davidson for my birthday.

1716
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:17,698
lt sucked because
l couldn't reach it.

1717
01:22:17,832 --> 01:22:22,236
l took it back, tried
to get it custom-sized ,
they gave me a Moped .

1718
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:24,438
Moped sucks, they
have like no power.

1719
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:27,441
l couldn't go over
a speed bump--
[imitates small motor]

1720
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:44,925
So l just got a little dog .
l haven't named it yet.

1721
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:46,660
l like the way white
people name their pets.

1722
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:50,230
You name them
after real people, like,
this is my dog , Benjamin .

1723
01:22:50,365 --> 01:22:52,266
Hi , Benji .

1724
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:55,135
Latinos we don't really care
what we name our pet, we'll
name it after any object.

1725
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:57,438
l went over my cousin's house,
he says l brought a neat dog .

1726
01:22:57,572 --> 01:22:59,139
He's right over there.

[laughter]

1728
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:05,446
Black people, they always
get big old tough dogs.

1729
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:06,780
A pit bull , [barks] .

1730
01:23:06,915 --> 01:23:08,549

[laughter]

1732

You know l can't jog

01:24:42,444 --> 01:24:43,877
He parks in front

[laughter]

1760
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:46,547
