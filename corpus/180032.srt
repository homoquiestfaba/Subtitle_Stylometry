1
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,424
We will begin in ten seconds.

2
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,766
Please ad just your universal translator
to the language of your understanding.

3
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:40,533
We will begin in five seconds.

4
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:45,643
We will begin in zero seconds.

5
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,082
Of all the creatures
in the universe....

6
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:56,486
none possess the mating ritual
as complex, as perverse...

7
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:01,084
as tragically beautiful
as the earthbound human.

8
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:04,927
More passionate than the Orktamus
of Centali Five...

9
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:08,092
more neurotic than
the Sleekanda of Sleewa...

10
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,159
it is a wonder that
these furry creatures...

11
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:13,137
have not gone extinct
millennia ago.

12
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:15,606
But in spite of their
self-inflicted paradox...

13
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:17,836
their numbers grow
at a rapid pace...

14
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,175
over-consuming
their tiny planet.

15
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:23,647
It is from these creatures that we have
acquired the universal expression...

16
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:26,082
"fuck like people. "

17
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,794
The young male begins his sojourn
along with others of his pack.

18
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,530
Their bellies are full from a hearty
meal of plant and roasted animal flesh.

19
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:54,372
The male hides his nervousness
from the rest of the pack.

20
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:58,144
He has tried this a great many times
before with limited success.

21
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,880
His cerebral cortex
pounds with anxiety...

22
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,289
his loins,
with hyperactive semen.

23
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:13,426
The male gives the Great Warrior
sheaths of thin, green tree bark...

24
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,695
hoping that the color
will satisfy the Great Warrior...

25
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:17,793
and he will
allow the male to enter.

26
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:21,466
The Great Warrior is pleased.

27
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,510
He places a symbol of ink
upon the male's hand--

28
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:28,741
proof to the world
that the male is ready to mate.

29
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:36,084
His new surroundings
are pleasing to him, familiar.

30
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,020
He has been to sacred meeting grounds
such as this before.

31
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,862
He makes his way
to the long, elevated surface...

32
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,906
where he will consume
small amounts of fermented grain...

33
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:57,602
in the hopes that it will make him
more appealing to a potential mate.

34
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:01,202
In fact,
it has the opposite effect.

35
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:05,479
The fermented grain makes all females
more appealing to him.

36
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,254
Well, almost all.

37
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:16,454
This one, he feels, lacks the correct
genetic stock for motherhood.

38
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:20,728
This one would make
a better father than mother.

39
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,734
The male would be redundant.

40
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,952
This one is clearly reserved
for wealthy tribal chieftains.

41
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:47,393
To prepare for mating, she sways
her hips and flails her behind...

42
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,918
in an attempt to dislodge
her egg from her uterus.

43
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:58,897
The male exhales sadly.
He knows his place in the pack.

44
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:08,139
The female feels
the male's gaze upon her...

45
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:12,082
and marks him as a potential
father of her future cubs.

46
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,859
Her ovulation complete...

47
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,090
the female ceases her gyrations
and returns to her pack.

48
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:26,859
It is the male's opportunity.

49
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,163
Like all creatures
of the universe...

50
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,931
the male and female begin
by examining each other.

51
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,703
Tentatively...

52
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,340
carefully...

53
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:50,712
not willing to reveal
too much...

54
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,459
or commit too far.

55
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:01,063
The female bares her teeth
to show she wants to mate with him.

56
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,863
The male mimics this gesture...

57
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:07,133
to show that he, too,
would like to mate right now.

58
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:11,134
Encouraged, the male
attempts the next step.

59
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,236
It is a long walk for him.

60
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:18,011
He must make the perfect greeting
if he wishes to be fruitful.

61
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:25,487
If you're not a professional dancer,
you should be.

62
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,025
What?

63
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:32,594
If you're not a professional dancer,
you should be!

64
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:34,863
What?


65
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:39,496
- I think you're a great dancer!
- What?

66
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,254
But his introduction was flawed.

67
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:03,261
There will be no fruit
for the male this evening.

68
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,122
The female, for her part...

69
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,225
uses her time
in the sacred meeting ground...

70
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:14,035
fending off the advances
of all but the right males.

71
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:17,270
- This one lacks intellect.
- Bye.

72
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:25,082
This one lacks
a warrior's spirit.

73
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,381
He would be devoured
on the first hunt, she feels...

74
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,421
Leaving her to raise her cubs
by herself.

75
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,286
Nice meeting you. Bye.

76
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,494
- You're very sweet. Thanks. Bye.
- This one just smells funny.

77
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:46,596
But like the childhood story
of Goldilocks and the three--

78
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:50,938
- Hey. Remember me?
- this one is just right.

79
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,571
Look, I'm sorry. I just wanted to
say you're a good dancer.

80
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:58,515
I wasn't being crude.
I'm just a bad mime.

81
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,747
A guy apologizing.

82
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,016
Now that's the way
to start a relationship.

83
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,116
Jenny Smith.

84
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,251
The male and female
rub their paws together.

85
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,655
The female studies the male...

86
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,268
as he, in turn, studies her.

87
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,761
- Channel.
- Shampoo.

88
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,974
Well, it's nice.
It suits you.

89
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,308
- Brut.
- Channel.

90
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,716
Do you often wear
women's perfume?

91
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,617
Yeah. It's my way of showing
how I understand women.

92
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,621
I'm going for that sensitive,
'80s-guy kind of thing.

93
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,180
- Does it work?
- No. Not since the '80s.

94
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:42,193
But, oh, man,
in kindergarten I was hot stuff.

95
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,286
The female exhales rapidly...

96
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:47,958
to show that her lungs are strong
and she can bear many children.

97
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,468
The male exhales rapidly
as well...

98
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:54,700
to show that he has endurance
and can impregnate her many times over.

99
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,609
She lets him know
that she is pleased...

100
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,009
for that is what she
is looking for in a mate.

101
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,309
He is pleased because all his blood
has rushed to his loins...

102
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:05,373
- and he doesn't know any better.
- Look, I want to keep talking to you...

103
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:10,479
but I, you know, I was on my way
to use the facilities.

104
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,925
All right.
Have a nice life.

105
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,120
Wait. I'm just going
to the bathroom.

106
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,663
Yeah, right. Like I haven't used
that one a gazillion times.

107
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:21,894
Come on. You think that I'm
blowing you off? Are you nuts?

108
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,697
That's a really nice way
of putting it, but still--

109
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,033
Okay, I'll tell you what.
I'll hold it in.

110
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,073
- Really?
-Yeah.

111
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,131
That's so sweet.

112
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,787
- You're screwing with me, right?
- Yeah.

113
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,288
Okay.

114
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,020
The female is pleased.

115
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,689
The young male has great potential
for fatherhood, she feels.

116
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,755
He'll provide well
for her cubs...

117
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,893
and stick around long after
she is fat and bloated.

118
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:02,107
She consumes fermented grain
to celebrate her good fortune.

119
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:07,742
- See? I came back.
- Groovy. Let's dance.

120
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,873
Oh. I don't know if
that's such a good idea.

121
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,886
- You don't dance?
- No, I do, but like a white guy.

122
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,980
I don't know if you're
impressed enough with me yet.

123
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,581
Risk it.

124
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,656
Okay. Just remember
I would've held it in for you.

125
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,608
And so the male and female see their way
through the intricate dance...

126
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,007
of the mating ritual.

127
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,443
Both sides must play
their roles perfectly...

128
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,640

confronting an infinite barrage
of obstacles...

129
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,484
necessitating the involvement
of countless other humans...

130
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:49,020
in order for the species
to reproduce.

131
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,488
We don't know
if they will succeed.

132
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:55,516
And if they don't, we will film
another couple who does.

133
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,598
- Hey, you want to get some coffee?
- I have to get up early tomorrow.

134
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,659
- Sorry.
-Jenny! There you are.

135
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,467
- We've been looking for you.
- Guys, this is Billy.

136
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,031
Billy, these are my two best friends,
Lydia and Lana.

137
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,306
- Hi.
- Lydia? Hi. Lana, right?

138
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,473
- It's the other way around.
- I meant it the other way around.

139
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,040
The female shows the male
to her pack...

140

00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,643
but the male is not interested
in the female's pack.

141
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:25,020
He wants to be
with the female alone.

142
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:28,492
There is still something
he must get from her--

143
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,995
something without which the mating
ritual will come to an end.

144
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,224
Panic sets in.

145
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,132
It is difficult to achieve
with the female's pack present...


146
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,762
but he must ask for it in order
for the species to go on.

147
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,136
Can I get your number?

148
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,368
I was wondering when
you were gonna ask.

149
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,740
- He's cute.
- Yeah, he is cute.

150
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:49,212
Shut up.
Turn around.

151
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:53,377
The female scratches numerical symbols
onto a white sheath of tree bark..

152
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:56,148
hoping the design
will please the male.

153
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:01,022
- Great.
- The male is pleased by the design.

154
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:04,028
To him, it is the prettiest
of all pictures.

155
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,223
I'll call you in--

156
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,323
- I n a while?
- Yeah. I'll call you in a while.

157
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,392
Great. Yeah,
I'll call you in a while.

158
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,801
In a while.

159
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,499
Sorry.

160
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:16,234
Tell you what. Hmm?

161
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,435
- Bye.
- Bye.

162
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,537
- Bye. Nice meeting you.
- Yeah. You too. So long.

163
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,583
The male is happy
with his new mate.

164
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,711
It has been a goodnight
at the sacred meeting ground.

165
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,583
The humans of this hemisphere
of the planet...

166
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:38,528
spend most of their time at play,
in tall, steel huts of their own making.

167
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,862
The male busies himself
with numerical symbols...

168
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,064
and electronically enhanced intelligence
to create a picture...

169
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:50,131
pleasing to those superior
to him in the pack.

170
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,201
This game
he calls "accounting. "

171
00:11:56,282 --> 00:12:00,150
He plays with a toy named after one
of the small rodents of his planet.

172
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,154
He presses his fingers
against the rodent's buttocks...

173
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,658
and gently taps
upon its cheeks.

174
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,593
Still, he prefers the female
of his own species.

175
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,962
The male is not pleased
with his picture.

176
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,636
He finds the female's picture
much prettier.

177
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,938
He wants to know how she can
make such a pretty picture.

178
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,182
Hi. This is Bill Waterson.

179
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,948
Oh, yes, Mr. Greenwood.

180
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:38,489
Well, we'd love
to help you, but...

181
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:41,287
gosh, I tell you,
we're really booked solid.

182
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,523
Let me see if there's
any openings here.

183
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:48,158
Boy, we're just--
we're just swamped here.

184
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:53,165
Oh! Here's a cancellation at--

185
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:56,606
How's Thursday at 3:00?

186
00:12:56,675 --> 00:13:00,202
Or now.
Yeah. We could do now.

187
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,976
Now is fine. Yeah, great.
We'll see you.

188
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,449
- We got a client?
- Looks that way.

189
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,714
- Torrance referred us.
- Torrance is a deadbeat.

190
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,279
Yeah, but he's our deadbeat.
We got three clients.

191
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,985
- I think we ought to embrace him.
- All right.

192
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,696
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

193
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,691
- You're going to call her, aren't you?

- No.

194
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:26,499
- Tell the truth.
- Okay. You're developing...

195
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:29,234
a serious body odor problem,
but I don't think that's relevant.

196
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:34,041
You just met her last night. If you
call her now, you'll scare her off.

197
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:37,879
- Come on. I don't play those games.
- Don't do it, man.

198
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,350
- She'll think you want her.
- I do want her.

199
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:44,048
I know, but if she thinks that,
she'll find somebody else.

200
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,591
Someone who doesn't want her?

201
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,923
- Someone cool.
- Oh, but I'm not cool.

202
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,827
Exactly. That's why you got to wait
a few days before you call her.

203
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:55,526
And when you do ask her out, act like
you're doing her a favor, you know?

204
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,694
Like you don't give a damn
if she says yes or no...

205
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,068
'cause you got all these other
chickadees waiting for you.

206
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:04,838
- And that'll impress her?
- Right into the sack.

207
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,504
Please do not adjust
your universal translator.

208
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,844
We are not experiencing
technical difficulties.

209
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:13,681
This is a human thing.
It makes no sense to us either.

210
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:18,116
Heed my words, Grasshopper.

211
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,590
Be patient.
Be a champion.

212
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,684
You know, Jimmy,
it occurs to me...

213
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:26,390
that I haven't seen you with a woman
in about three years.

214
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:30,458
Right. That's because I always
phone them the very next morning.

215
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:47,813
The great hunting
and gathering ground.

216
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,414
Check this out.

217
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:55,324
The female finds an animal skin
To shelter her from the cold.

218
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,419
- Way too obvious.
- Yeah.

219
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:01,159
The pack feels it will not keep her
warm enough in the harsh winters.

220
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:06,396
The female's task in this initial part
Of the mating dance...

221
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,168
is to wait for the male
to contact her.

222
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:13,769
This causes some anxiety, but she is
confident in the wisdom of nature.

223
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,440
- What do you see in him, anyway?
- He seems like a nice guy.

224
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,506
He's an accountant,
for God's sake.

225
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:23,851
Yeah, he's cute, but what are you
gonna do with an accountant?

226
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,188
I think you should call Mike
and beg him to take you back.

227
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,955
Yeah, Mike was gorgeous.

228
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,192
- And I'm not telling you again.
- There's sure no denying that.

229
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,928
And before him, remember Ed?
No one was cooler than Ed.

230
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:40,872
I don't need cool.

231
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,000
And Robert was like
the smartest guy I'd ever met.

232
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:48,172
But he'd humiliate me every chance
he got. There's got to be better.

233
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,943
I think it's time
for a nice guy.

234
00:15:57,056 --> 00:16:00,025
The male's sleeping hut.

235
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,287
Fuck! Fuck!

236
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,226
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

237
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,321
The male is now ready to mate.

238
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:10,459
Fuck. How could I lose
her number?

239
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,527
Billy, look
on the bright side, man.

240
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:16,301
If she was that fine, she probably
Gave you a bogus number anyway.

241
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:22,011
- I'll help you find it.
- The need for the female is harsh.

242
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,515
The male's body
tenses with anxiety.

243
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:28,576
A bodily liquid called "sweat"
is transferred through his pores.

244
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:32,818
A foam called "saliva"
dribbles out of his mouth.

245
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:36,383
This condition will not pass
until he has mated with his female.

246
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,896
The best-looking girl that ever
talked to me, and I lose her number.

247
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:40,989
- I blew it. I'm an asshole.
- All right, wait.

248
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,933
Let's just retrace your steps.
Where was the last place you saw it?

249
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,495
- Work.
- Right.

250
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,041
I was gonna call her, and you talked
me out of it. I put it in my pocket.

251
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,703
- Did you check your suit?
- It couldn't be in my suit.

252
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,712
My suit's been at the dry cleaners
this whole time.

253
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,714
I just picked it up this morn--
Oh, shit.

254
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,779
The male searches
through his animal skins.

255
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,289
Perhaps the female is inside.

256
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:12,293
Blinded by his need
to procreate...

257
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:16,630
the male shows some lint
to the other member of the pack.

258
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:20,399
"Is this the female I seek?"
he asks.

259
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:23,873
Yep. You're an asshole.

260
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:27,469
"No, it is not, "
responds the other.

261
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,275
The male finds solace
in a bound collection...

262
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,375
of sheaths of white tree bark.

263
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:37,746
Perhaps he will find
the female inside.

264
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:41,156
You're gonna call, like, every J. Smith 

in the entire phone book?

265
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,319
It's only, like,
four or five pages.

266
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,420
Face it, Billy.
You lost her.

267
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:49,834
The male will not forego
the mating ritual.


268
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,927
The species must prevail.

269
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:55,565
It will be very difficult for him,
but he will not give up.

270
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:59,941
For the human male is among the horniest
Of creatures in the known universe.

271
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:03,743
- Hi. May I speak with Jenny Smith?
- There's no Jenny Smith here.

272
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,785
- Is this "J. Smith"?
- This is John Smith.

273
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,843
Oh, never mind.

274
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,788
Yeah, this might take a while.

275
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,657
The male uses a rudimentary
communication device...

276
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,753
to seek his mate.

277
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,197
"Have you seen my female?"
he asks everyone.

278
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,360
"She is mine.
You cannot have her."

279
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:28,372
- Hi. May I speak to a Jenny Smith?
- Yes, this is Jenny.

280
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,702
Oh, Jenny, great.

281
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,835
Did you meet a guy named Billy
at Cachet the other night?

282
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:37,007
About five-ten, brown hair,
nice smile?

283
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:40,518
Mmm. Do you like leather
Or chains?

284
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:43,111
- What?
- I'd love to meet you.

285
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:46,055
- Come on by.
- Maybe another time.

286
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,324
Maybe another time.

287
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:54,195
- Hello. Is this Jenny Smith?
- Yes, this is Jenny Smith.

288
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:58,396
Hi. Are you about five-five,
110 pounds...

289
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,304
brown hair,
really nice boobs?

290
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:03,568
Hello?

291
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,736
Hello. Is Jenny Smith
home, please?

292
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,178
I didn't think so.

293
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,510
Ring.

294
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:20,350
Ring now.
Okay, in five seconds.

295
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:23,326
Four, three, two, one.

296
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:26,387
Ring.
Okay, that was zero.

297
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,366
Ring now!

298
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,425
Ring!

299
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,776
- The female in heat.
- This is ridiculous. Ridiculous!

300
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:43,110
Why would you even take my number
If you're not gonna call me?

301
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,586
It's because I didn't
put out, isn't it?

302
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:52,749
You saw me dance,
and I was looking kind of hot...

303
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:55,884
and you just figured me
for a quick, easy lay.

304
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,191
Well, I've got news
For you, mister.

305
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,254
If you just want
some cheap slut...

306
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:04,029
you've come
to the wrong gal!

307
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:05,729
Ring!

308
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,366
I'm such a loser.

309
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:15,402
If he was gonna call, he would've
called by now. Come with us.

310
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,880
I just want to give him
a little bit longer.

311
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,316
Jen, it's been like
five days already.

312
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,785
- He's just playing it cool.
- Cool?

313
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:24,879
The man is
a fucking accountant.

314
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,619
Could you show a little sensitivity?
She liked the guy.

315
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:31,254
I just called him a fucking accountant.
I didn't say he wasn't cute.

316
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:37,166
- He is cute, isn't he?
- Yeah, he was. I'm sorry, Jen.

317
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:42,165
The female wonders
How the others in the pack...

318
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,971
have so forgotten
the mating ritual.

319
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:47,773
Perhaps they have never felt
the thrill of mating...

320
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:51,976
and have not awoken these
maternal instincts within themselves.

321
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,484
I 'm just gonna give him
a little bit more time.

322
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:57,021
Okay, but if you change your mind,
we'll be at the Dresden.

323
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,616
- Okay? So meet us there.
- Okay.

324
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:03,456
- Good luck.
- Bye.

325
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:14,100
The female grows anxious.

326
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,163
The male has not shown himself...

327
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,266
nor does it appear he will.

328
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,845
The female is ready to find
a new candidate for mating.

329
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,939
Hey, guys, wait up!

330
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:42,023
Hi. This is Lana.

331
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,125
Jenny and I aren't here,
so leave a message at the beep...

332
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:46,193
and we'll get back to you.

333
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:51,334
If this is a guy,
Jenny maybe cuter, but I put out.

334
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,806
Hi. I'm calling for Jenny Smith.
This is Billy.

335
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,546
We met at Cachet a few nights ago.
You threw your drink at me...

336
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,350
- then gave me your number.
- The male calls out for the female...

337
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,857
searching the ether
for his true mate...

338
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:09,860
but she doesn't answer
his cry.

339
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:13,193
All seems lost
for the species.


340
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:16,063
... took my jacket to the cleaners,
and you got shredded.

341
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:18,295
Anyway...

342
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,066
I've gone through the whole
LA phone book trying to find you and--

343
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:24,700
Well, okay, not all of LA,
just 21 3 and most of31 0.

344
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:27,074
God, I hope you don't
live in the Valley.

345
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:29,238
I mean, okay,
nothing against the Valley.

346
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,339
I just don't think I have
the strength for 81 8.

347
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:35,853
So if this is you,
give me a call at 555-7754.

348
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:38,253
I'd love to have dinner
With you or something.


349
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:40,382
If it's not you...

350
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:44,462
Leave me alone.

351
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,259
- Is Jenny Smith there?
- Hi. Is this Jenny Smith?

352
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:50,859
-I met a girl at a club the other night.
-Thank you.

353
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,938
It was a dreary day
For the male.

354
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,718
He listens to water beating
against a ceramic wall.

355
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,157
It is a soothing sound for him,
with a calming effect.

356
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:19,323
Hi. This is Jenny. I got your message.
I knew you'd call.

357
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,491
- I told every one you'd call.
- Yes!

358
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:25,400
I can't believe you went through
two area codes just to find me.

359
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,769
I'm really, really flattered,
or very, very afraid.

360
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:35,070
Anyway, I'd love to have dinner
with you. Now that you have my number...

361

00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,978
- you better use it.
- Wait. That was a random shot.

362
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,676
- I'll be waiting by the phone.
- No, leave it! Leave it!

363
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:49,125
The male weeps as the female's
mating cry comes to an end.

364
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,718
Billy, this is your mother.

365
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,730
I haven't heard from you
in almost a week.

366
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,767
I'm wondering If you're living or dead.
Call me either way.

367
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,894
Hi. It's Jenny again,
on the off chance...

368
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,904
you didn't keep track
of which number was mine.

369
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:02,906
I know no one
can be that dumb.


370
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:07,206
But just in case,
it's 3 1 0-555-01 81.

371
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,304
- Now use it.
- Yes!

372
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,372
But it is the second
Of the female's mating cries...

373
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,475
that causes the male
to go rabid.

374
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,679
Mating is imminent,
and he knows it.

375
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:22,224
The female prepares carefully
for her next encounter with the male.

376
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,457
She paints her face with berries
and chemically processed colors...

377
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,691
hiding from the male
her natural state--

378
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:30,530
which she hopes to show him
at a later time.

379
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:35,161
She uses chemically altered forms of
vegetation to cover parts of her body.

380
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,865
Then other forms of vegetation
over those.

381
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,708
She leaves much of her body
uncovered...

382
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,079
but is careful to cover
the first layer of vegetation.

383
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,981
She puts the excretions of
small, sea-dwelling creatures...

384
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,421
through holes in the lobes
of her hearing organs...

385
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,550
which she had mutilated
long ago...

386
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:57,493
as a symbol of her entry
into womanhood.

387
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,224
She pulls a bone

out of her skull.

388
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:06,494
She is ready.

389
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,776
The male has a much more
arduous task.

390
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,073
He must appear strong
to the female--

391
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:16,943
so strong that he doesn't care
how he appears.

392
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,745
It is this appearance
he must strive for.

393
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,748
He uses a hydrogen and oxygen
mixture with some animal fat...

394
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:27,690
to remove the planet's
nourishment from his body.

395
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,390
He debates over removing
the fur from his face...

396
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:34,762
with an artificial
tooth of steel.

397
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,858
He ponders this
for a long time...

398
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:40,871
before deciding to keep the fur
as a display of his masculinity...

399
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,737
then changes his mind again.

400
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:46,868
Meticulously,
he combs his hair...

401
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:50,403
making certain
that it appears uncombed.

402
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:57,249
He covers his body with
the same vegetation as the female...

403
00:25:57,322 --> 00:26:00,553
then his upper torso
with the hair of one creature...

404
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,889
and that with the hide
of another.

405
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,121
Now he is ready.

406
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:08,222
I shouldn't have shaved.

407
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:18,966
The male and the female
feed on a meal...

408
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,535
of dead Earth creature
and vegetation.

409
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,316
Both herbivore and carnivore...

410
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,317
the human is one of few animals
in the universe...

411
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:29,751
that will eat
just about anything.

412
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:41,495
I mean, come on now.
"I n computers" could mean anything.

413
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:43,625
It doesn't matter.

414
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,693
All right, if you won't
tell me what you do...

415
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,534
will you at least tell me
why you won't tell me?

416
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,440
Because guys find it
a turn off when girls...

417
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:55,104
babble on about themselves
on the first date.

418
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,614
- Tell me about your accounting firm.
- Oh, I can't.

419
00:26:57,682 --> 00:27:00,446
Government work
kind of stuff?

420
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,178
Girls find it a turnoff
when guys babble on...

421
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,689
about themselves
on a first date.

422
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:09,625
- We definitely have a problem.
- Well, rules are rules.

423
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:12,322
When you think about it, it's amazing
when people actually get together.

424
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,558
Is that really
one of the guys' rules?

425
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,124
Well, not so much a rule
as a guideline.

426
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:20,467
Good. 'Cause you're the first guy
I ever met who follows it.

427
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:23,642
I like coming up here.

428
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,405
I like coming up here.

429
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:30,244
Even on a drab,
smoggy night it's nice.

430
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,545
It's real quiet,
you know?

431
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:37,554
- It's peaceful.
- Yeah. It's a beautiful night tonight.

432
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:39,556
Guess we got lucky.

433
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:43,651
I guess we did.

434
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:45,662
Yeah, I guess we did.

435
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,062
The male and the female
open their souls to each other...

436
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,767
sharing their pain
and sadnesses...

437
00:27:56,841 --> 00:28:00,277
each lessening the burden
on their partner.

438
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,712
Many experts cite this
as the most beautiful part...

439
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:06,182
of the human mating ritual--

440
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:09,118
other than the copulation.

441
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,587
My little brother
was born blind...

442
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:15,057
so when I first
got into computers...

443
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:19,290
he'd come hang out with me
and ask me questions about it.

444
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,161
He was so into it.

445
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,726
It made me want to cry.

446
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:29,067
So, where I work now...

447
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:33,236
we're trying to create
this special monitor for blind people.

448
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:37,873
But, I mean, we're years away
from getting it--

449
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:40,247
if it's even possible.

450
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:45,255
You'll get it.

451
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:59,937
I worked my butt off
to get through school.

452
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:02,234
I held every shitty job
There was.

453
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:06,801
But I knew that if you're not
a professional, then you're nothing.

454
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:11,975
So there I was,
making a decent living at a big firm...

455
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,518
but...

456
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:18,647
I was still getting
pushed around by assholes.

457
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:23,126
So one day, about seven,
eight months ago...

458
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:26,322
my friend Jimmy and I
decided to start our own firm.

459
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:30,925
We pooled everything we had.
We moved in together to save on rent.

460
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:33,835
We got a "fancy-schmancy"
office in Century City...

461
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:37,306
and Waterson-Connors
was born.

462
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,809
That took a lot of guts.

463
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,005
It's horrible.

464
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,572
If we don't get any more clients soon,
we're gonna have to go crawling back.

465
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,379
That'll take
a lot of guts too.

466
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,817
Whoa.

467
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,730
So, what are
your parents like?

468
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,359
My parents?
Oh, they're great.

469
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,425
That's one place
where I got real lucky.

470
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:08,370
You know, typical Leave It to Beaver
kind of deal.

471
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,771
Just thinking about them
makes me happy.

472
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:17,343
What the hell you doin' inside?
It's a beautiful day!

473
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:19,508
My father was
A soft-spoken man.

474
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:23,020
And look at this room!
It's spotless!

475
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:25,647
What kind of kid
Are you, anyway?

476
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:28,692
- But he always had a kind word for me.
- Be a kid, goddamn it!

477
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,821
- Have some fun!
- Always urging me to enjoy life.

478
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:36,890
Like that!

479
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:40,563
And he taught me the things
he knew most about--real man stuff.

480
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:42,902
But still, he was never afraid
to get a little mushy.

481
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:47,237
And I love you.

482
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:53,012
It was a magical time for me.

483
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:58,417
And my mother? Mom was
the queen of style and fashion.

484
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:01,083
Was your father in here?

485
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,457
Well, don't worry about him.

486
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:08,295
But she always had
that mother smell, you know?

487
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,858
Chicken soup and floor wax.

488
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:16,134
You're Mama's
good little boy.

489
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,368
Mama loves you.

490
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,536
Yes, she does.

491
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:24,776
Mommy loves you...

492
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:27,409
loves you, loves you.

493
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:30,386
She loves you.

494
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,446
Dad!

495
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:35,253
Yeah, I was real lucky.

496
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,452
The male's task...

497

00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:41,464
is to determine
if the female is ready.

498
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:45,559
Moving too soon or too late
May result in disaster.

499
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:49,403
But the human female
emits no odor to let him know.

00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:54,138
- What?
- Oh--

501
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,272
What were your parents like?

502
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,415
They're great.

503
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:03,818
The female is ready.

504
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:07,085
But she must wait for the male
to figure this out on his own.

505
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:09,149
She can emit no odor
to help him.

506
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:13,288
In fact, to do so
would be disastrous.

507
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:20,996
They move toward each other--

508
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:24,303
slowly, cautiously.

509
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:31,508
The future of their species
dependent on the next few seconds.

510
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:41,181
- The male wonders how he can...
- Are you okay?

511
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,625
- make her think he did this on purpose.
- Yeah.

512
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:47,187
Is it too late to point out
how romantic the stars look at night?

513
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,932
- But he fails.
- I'll race you to the water fountain.

514
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:52,992
Man.

515
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:59,543
Like so many creatures
on so many planets...

516
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,908
nothing gives more pleasure
than a simple run...

517
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,175
through the darkened vegetation
of one's habitat...

518
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:07,149
toward a pure, crystal spring.

519
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:09,584
- Beat you.
- Oh, would you?

520
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:23,993
They move toward each other
and they brush lips.

521
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,328
Ready for procreation...

522
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:31,705
the male slips his tongue
into the female's mouth.

523
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:37,713
But her egg is not
in her mouth, he discovers...

524
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:41,616
and even if it were,
his semen is not in his tongue.

525
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:46,123
The human reproductive organs
are in the pelvic region.

526
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:50,126
Just like a human male not to stop
and ask for directions.

527
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:55,693
Over many encounters
spanning an entire lunar revolution...

528
00:33:55,767 --> 00:34:00,602
the male and female feed on more
dead animals and vegetation together.

529
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:11,437
They return to the sacred
meeting ground...

530
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:15,816
and experience together the metallic
vibrations oftheir first meeting.

531
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,617
Let's go all the way

532
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,714
Every day

533
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:23,420
To a distant world

534
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:29,998
They ride mechanical beasts
that invoke nausea and fear.

535
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,507
They watch their sun
disappear in the horizon...

536
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,442
hopeful that it will return
and not go supernova...

537
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:43,446
causing an instant suffocation
and death.

538
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:51,319
They watch moving shadows
in dark caves together.

539
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:19,111
Human females enjoy stories
about one person dying slowly.

540
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:23,812
The males prefer stories
Of many people dying quickly.

541
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:39,366
But they stay through
the other's shadows...

542
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:41,667
for it is not the shadows
they desire...

543
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:44,401
but the companionship.

544
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:50,804
And at the end
Of each night...

545
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:54,215
they brush their lips against
the other's once more...

546
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:56,310
and taste the other's tongue...

547
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:59,379
growing closer to true mating.

548
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:04,019
This time, the female allows the male
to touch her bulbous chest...

549
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:06,791
which contains
the infant's milk.

550
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,029
But no more.

551
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:21,609
This time she allows him
to taste of the infant's milk...

552
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:25,410
checking for poisons or impurities
on behalf of the child.

553
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,410
But no more.

554
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:37,728
The female must take things
in stages.

555
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:42,463
It is her task
to test the male...

556
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,093
to find the level of frustration

 he can endure.

557
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:48,263
Male frustration
being an integral part...

558
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:52,298
of the life together
she calls "marriage."

559
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:57,704
The female is ready.

560
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:24,638
The female removes all vegetation
from the male's body.

561
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:29,636
He from hers.

562
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,983
They lay upon one another...

563
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,427
their bodies tense
and moistened.

564
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,922
Unable to stand it any longer...

565
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:53,767
the male reaches for a thin,
red square of tree bark.

566
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,766
He bites into it
and produces its true fruit...

567
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:01,676
a tubular form
of vulcanized vegetation.

568
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:06,843
The male places the tubular vegetation
upon his seed shooter.

569
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,146
Okay.

570
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:15,124
He mounts the female.

571
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,007
He uses friction
to release his seed.

572
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:42,753
The mating ritual of the humans
Of Nocturis Five would end here.

573
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,845
But the earthbound human--

574
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:47,413
Like only six other creatures
in the known universe--

575
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:51,188
uses artificial means
to delay procreation.

576
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:54,823
For the vulcanized vegetation that
the male placed on his seed shooter...

577
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:59,268
will prevent his seed from ever
reaching the female's egg.

578
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,033
Like so--

579
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,720
Wow.
Oh, I guess it's true.

580
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,916
Nice guys really do
finish last.

581
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:27,463
The male arrives
at his playground, contented.

582
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:31,360
A sense of well-being
surrounds him.

583
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:43,245
The female is contented as well.

584
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,147
Jennifer, would you terribly mind
doing a little work today?

585
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:52,155
I'm sorry.
It's just such a beautiful day.

586
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:01,160
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

587
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:08,772
- A gift from the male.
- Oh! He didn't!

588
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,138
Raw vegetation
For the female to eat...

589
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:15,508
so she may keep up
her strength for motherhood.

590
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:19,640
He is so sweet.
I just can't believe how sweet he is.

591
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:25,645
The female plans to eat
the vegetation at a later time.

592
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,483
You slut.

593
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,550
You've only been seeing
this man for a month...

594
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:32,289
and you give it up
just like that?

595
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,331
Stay out of this.
You're embarrassing her.

596
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:36,992
I just don't want her
to develop a bad reputation.

597
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:39,262
Who are you, her mother?
It's none of your business.

598
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:41,804
The females of the pack
discuss the mating dance.

599
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:45,308
They are happy for her,
For the propagation of their species.

600
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:49,644
Males of the pack sense the progression
of the mating dance as well.

601
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:51,271
- Fucked her?
- Fucked her.

602
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:54,511
- Cool.
- The pack rejoices.

603
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:58,346
- Yes!
- Over time, the male and female...

604
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:01,152
continue to practice
the physicality of mating.

605
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:02,920
- Oh!
- Yes!

606
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,634
It is difficult for them,
causing them pain and anguish.

607
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:14,728
God!

608
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:20,566
But for the good of their
species, they endure.

609
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,514
And endure...

610
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:37,922
and endure.

611
00:41:56,647 --> 00:42:01,050
But still they feel they have
not perfected their craft.

612
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:07,216
You get a better price
If you buy them in bulk.

613
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,456
Like my cousin, she had this
big, old-fashioned wedding...

614
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,965
with hundreds of people--
lots of brides maids...

615
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,297
a band, ushers, flowers.

616
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:22,465
I was only about ten, but I always
dreamed of a wedding like that.

617
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,599
Sounds great.
Hope I'm invited.

618
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:30,908
- Oh, God.
- Hey, Jenny, wait up!

619
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:34,576
Other males see the female
and want to mate with her as well.

620
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:36,643
-Just walk away.
- Who are these guys?

621
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:42,549
- Hey, I've been meaning to call you.
- Hi, Mike.

622
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:44,617
Mike, Tony,
this is Billy.

623
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:46,720
- How ya doin'?
- Shut up.

624
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:48,788
You dumped me for this fag?

625
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:51,130
No, I dumped you
Because you're an asshole.

626
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:53,396
I found this fag on my own.

627
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,995
Don't you just love her?

628
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,906
Look, a lot of time
has passed.

629
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:01,308
I know I made some mistakes,
but can't we just talk about it?

630
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:03,744
No. I found
somebody else now.

631
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:07,443
- Come on, Jen. Just give me a chance.
- Let go.

632
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:10,316
- Hey, look, we don't want any trouble.
- Fag.

633
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:13,322
-Just come with me, please. Calm down!
- Let go of me!

634
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:16,985
The male must protect his mate
And defend his territory.

635
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:21,122
The male is overwhelmed with an urge
to attack, but he is frightened.

636
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:24,361
There are more of them,
and they are bigger.

637
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,767
- Relax, will you?
- Let go!

638
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:31,638
The male attacks,
but he is no match for them.

639
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:36,510
The mating ritual may come
to an end for him after all.

640
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,070
Hey, Tony-- catch!

641
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:47,122
The female makes her choice.

642
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:04,466
He taught me a few things
when we dated.

643
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,410
They retreat to the tranquility
Of the male's sleeping hut.

644
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,512
Thank you.

645
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,657
I don't get it.
You're beautiful.

646
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:27,424
You're smart.
You can beat the crap out of people.

647
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:31,161
You're the perfect woman.
What do you see in me?

648
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:34,398
That you think
I'm the perfect woman.

649
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:38,100
You knew you were gonna lose,
and you defended me anyway.

650
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,769
You're incredible.

651
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:51,345
I don't think I can.
It kind of hurts.

652
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:54,789
You don't have to.
I will.

653
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,953
The female attempts
To swallow the male's seed...

654
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:05,365
for only through the sense of taste can
she know that his seed is healthy...

655
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:08,234
and will produce
a strong child.

656
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:14,269
Oh! God!
Oh, God!

657
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:19,145
The male prays to his deity
to make his seed strong and healthy.

658
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,545
- Where's the egg?
- It's a blow job again.

659
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:29,319
- Oh, man!
- What do they expect us to do?

660
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,623
- Where are we supposed to go?
- Aw, come on!

661
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:34,493
- Where's the egg?
- This is bullshit.

662
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,591
- Let's go back.
- What a waste.

663
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:46,074
His seed is strong.
He passes her test.

664
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,807
Thanks.
You're the best.

665
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,440
Keep telling me that
and one day I might believe it.

666
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:54,746
Oh, you should
believe it now.

667
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:01,118
Are you ready to take
this relationship to the next step?

668
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:04,092
We just got to this step.

669
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,629
I think you'll like it.

670
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:12,368
Okay, sure.
If you think so.

671
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:12,603
Yikes! An AIDS test?
You said I'd like this.

672
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:16,198
Yikes! An AIDS test?
You said I'd like this.

673
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,298
You're the one who's always
complaining that using a condom...

674
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:20,366
is like taking a shower
in a raincoat.

675
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,469
This way
I'll have my diaphragm...

676
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:24,537
and we won't have
to worry about anything.

677
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:28,949
- I wasn't worried until we got here.
- It's just a precaution.

678
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:31,647
Besides, you said you haven't
been with that many women.

679
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:34,316
Yeah, but they were all
sluts and drug addicts.

680
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:36,382
Don't look at me
like that.

681
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,485
Waterson, William?

682
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:40,553
I don't want to be dying.

683
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,656
They say you start dying
the moment you're born.

684
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:46,499
Well, I want to stay dying
for another70 or 80 years.

685
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,870
As true mating
grows ever nearer...

686
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:56,902
the male seeks medical advice
from the large female.

687
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:01,644
Instead, she sticks him
with needles and sucks out his blood.

688
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:05,085
"What a bitch, "
thinks the male.

689
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,646
Not to be outdone
by her partner...

690
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:11,251
the female puts herself
through the same ordeal.

691
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:15,230
But she, too, thinks that
the large female is a big, fat bitch.

692
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,560
The male worries.
If his blood is tainted...

693
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:22,332
he will not be able
to propagate his species.

694
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:25,398
He takes it upon himself
to contact the large female...

695
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:29,343
making sure to keep
his concerns well hidden.

696
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:37,776
The female shares
these concerns as well.

697
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:41,052
She, too, decides
to contact the large female.

698
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:51,566
Hi. This is Jenny Smith.

699
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:55,298
I'm calling for the results
of my HIV test.

700
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,141
Thank you!
Thank you very much.

701
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:04,578
You're so nice. Bye.
Whoo!

702
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:06,639
Oh. I see.

703
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:10,310
Are you sure?

704
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:14,649
All right. Thank you.

705
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:23,458
The male tells the pack
the horrific news.

706
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:25,592
His blood is unclean,
he has learned.

707
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:27,660
He can mate no longer.

708
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,901
No human cub will ever
Carry his genes.

709
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:34,137
- What exactly did they say?
- What's there to say?

710
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:36,236
They got the results.
It's negative.

711
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:38,474
Negative?

712
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:41,779
Negative. My whole life
is one big, fat negative.

713
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,154
Jimmy, come on!
That's not funny!

714
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:48,248
You yutz.

715
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:52,625
Billy, negative means
you don't have it.

716
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:56,097
No. Negative means--

717
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:58,999
- Are you sure?
- I'm pretty sure.

718
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:04,770
Hallelujah

719
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:09,775
The dance moves onward.

720
00:49:09,846 --> 00:49:12,280
The male sheds
the vulcanized vegetation...

721
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:16,649
as nature deems it
no longer necessary for mating.

722
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:23,126
The female prepares her self a circular
form of vulcanized vegetation...

723
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:25,787
proportionally fitted
to her cervix.

724
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:30,358
She spreads cream on it
for added taste.

725
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:38,506
This is still not mating.

726
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:42,909
The cream in question contains an active
ingredient known as spermicide...

727
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,505
which preys on the chemical
makeup of semen...

728
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:50,349
destroying it before
it can reach the female's womb.

729
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:54,857
A microscopic view of the inner workings
Of spermicide may look like this--

730
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:18,444
"Sperminator"--
enemy to all semen.

731
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:30,115
Mmm. I love you.

732
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:33,754
I know what you mean.
The hits just keep on coming.

733
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:37,923

How come you can't say it?

734
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:40,629
- Say what?
- I love you.

735
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,729
Oh, come on.
I say it all the time.

736
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:44,797
No, we've been together
for almost a year...

737
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,900
and you haven't
said it once.

738
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:50,378
Why not?
I know you do.

739
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:53,712
And that's
the important thing.

740
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:56,582
I love you.

741
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:58,712
You're the best.

742
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:01,053
You'll say it.

743
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:11,392
- You gonna be long?
-Just another minute or so.

744
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:13,902
That can mean anything.
You know what,Jen?

745
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:17,599
I feel pretty comfortable
with you. I think--

746
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:21,235
Are you ready to take
this relationship to the next step?

747
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:23,939
That's funny.

I was just thinking the same thing.

748
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:26,175
I've been wanting to--

749
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:32,921
The male takes the mating dance
to a higher, richer level.

750
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:36,754
Got 'em.
Third row.

751
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:40,285
On the floor. Lakers-Bulls.
You, me, tonight.

752
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:44,595
Sorry, man, I can't.
Me and Jenny got a thing.

753
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:48,160
No. No, no, no.
You have the thing.

754
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:50,263
Don't go getting whipped
on me, buddy.

755
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,331
I'm not whipped,
all right?

756
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:55,139
It's just, I'm supposed
to meet her parents tonight.

757
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:56,611
Whipped.

758
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:00,013
The pack prepares themselves
For the male's departure.

759
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:03,143
He will soon leave them
to start his new life with his mate.

760
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,154
Hey, I'm not whipped,
all right?

761
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:07,690
I've been stalling for three
weeks on this thing already...

762
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:09,486
and it's important to her,
so I gotta do it.

763
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:11,789


You're whipped.
Good as married. God help you.

764
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:15,730
I'm not whipped.
I'm considerate.

765
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:19,200
I've seen it a million times.
Pussy, pussy, whipped, whipped.

766
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:21,965
I'm warning you, Jimmy.
I don't want to hear that word again.

767
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:25,565
Okay, but which?
"Pussy," or "whipped"? 'Cause I--

768
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:28,668
Oh. Oh, we're pushing now?

769
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:32,909
They embrace, sadly,
perhaps for the last time.

770
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:45,827
The male meets the female's parents.
He is nervous.

771
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:50,595
Without parental approval,
the female may choose another mate.

772
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,692
I still think it's a little early
in our relationship for this.

773
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:56,603
I told you not to worry.
Come on. What are you so worried about?

774
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,698
- It's no big deal.
- I just don't do parents well.

775
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:00,766
Relax.
They're good people.

776
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,869
I'm sure they'll feel
the same about you as I do.

777
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:05,608
Come on.

778
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:08,276
Hi! We made it.

779
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:12,046
- Mom, Dad, this is Billy.
- Hi. Nice--

780
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:15,114
Eddie!
Your sister's here.

781
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:19,026
Wanting everything to go perfectly,
the female assures the male...

782
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:22,258
that her family is loving
and happy and normal.

783
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:24,926
Humans call this
a white lie.

784
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:30,472
Why do I smell gunpowder?

785

00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,873
Oh. You must be
Jenny's boyfriend.

786
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,940
I got this in 'Nam.

787
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:41,040
Killed myself
so many gooks with it...

788
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:43,312
the captain said
I could keep it.

789
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:46,321
I bought this at an auction
in London, England.

790
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,619
It's an antique.

791
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:50,717
I never fired it,
not once.

792
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:54,923
I guess I'm kind of waiting
for a special occasion.

793
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:58,092
You know why
I keep this around?

794
00:53:58,168 --> 00:54:01,001
- It can't be traced.
- Oh.

795
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:09,375
The breaking of bread.

796
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:13,780
The female's family nourish themselves
in silence, and stare at the male...

797
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:18,810
- because it scares him.
- Well, to be honest...

798
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:21,880

these days it's, you know,
it's really tough.

799
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:25,450
I think we're lucky. It's really tough
to find somebody you can make it with.

800
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:31,331
I mean, someone you can have
a relationship with...

801
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:33,426
and have
the relationship make it.

802
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:39,835
Mom, he has his own
accounting firm.

803
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:41,934
Isn't that great?
Tell her about it.

804
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:46,312
It's nothing, really.
It's nothing. It's small.

805
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,312
Isn't he cute, Mom?

806
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:56,052
- Look at those little cheeks. Oh, I--
- Stop.

807
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,390
- Stop.
- Okay.

808
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:04,825
Another obstacle is overcome,
and the mating dance goes on.

809
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:08,632
I... love... you!

810
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:13,074
I... love... this!

811
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,668
Bas... tard!

812
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:19,181
Because it's manipulative.

813
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:22,377
Nobody says "I love you"
unless they want something from you.

814
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:25,512
My parents used to pull that crap
on me all the time.

815
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:27,579
"I love you.
I didn't mean to yell at you.

816
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,682
I love you.
Clean up the kitchen.

817
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:32,193
I love you. Don't rat us out
to Child Services."

818
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:34,924
- They never said that.
- But my point still stands.

819
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,023
- When do I get to meet them, anyway?
- My parents?

820
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,091
I don't think that's
such a good idea, Jen.

821
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,194
We've been together
for over a year.

822
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:43,262
- Are you embarrassed of me?
- No, of them.

823
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:43,506
Mom, Dad, this is Jenny.

824
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:46,498
Mom, Dad, this is Jenny.

825
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:48,840
It is so nice
to meet you, Jenny.

826
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:51,540
We've heard nothing
But wonderful things about you.

827
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:55,414
- Thank you. The pleasure's mine.
- Can I offer you a drink?

828
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:57,680
We just opened a chardonnay
that'll knock your bra off.

829
00:55:57,754 --> 00:55:59,278
- Mom!
- It's okay.

830
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,290
Chardonnay sounds wonderful,
Mrs. Waterson.

831
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:04,725
Please-- Margot.
And this is Tom.

832
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:06,853
Go! Help yourself.

833
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:10,690
We'd serve it ourselves,
but the pouring...

834
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:13,258
is just a little bit
too much temptation for us.

835
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:16,237
- We're in a program.
- Oh, God.

836
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:18,206
Step 11.

837
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:20,708
- I'll get the wine.
- No, no, no. It's okay.

838
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:22,768
I'll get it.

839
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:27,709
What's wrong with you?
They're charming people.

840
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:32,978
She's so nice!

841
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,320
Yeah. Yeah, she is nice.

842
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,225
- She has beautiful eyes.
- Thank you.

843
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:40,888
- So, did you fuck her?
- What the hell's the matter with you?

844
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:42,431
What did I say?

845
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:44,865
- I asked if he fucked her.
- Of course he's fucked her.

846
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:46,902
Wouldn't you fuck her? I'd fuck her
and I'm not even into that.

847
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,198
- Mom!
- What?

848
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:50,796
I'm defending you.
Your father's the one causing trouble.

849
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:52,808
I just wanted to know if
Those were real hooters or not.

850
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:55,140
Of course they're real.
You can't buy hooters like that.

851
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:57,236
Okay, if you two continue
to embarrass me, we're leaving.

852
00:56:57,313 --> 00:57:00,942
There's just no pleasing you.
Come on.

853
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:11,257
It's an honor to have you
in our home, Jennifer.

854
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:15,195
The male's parents take an immediate
liking to their cub's mate...

855
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,699
and welcome her
into the pack.

856
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:20,292
For the female, it is like
gaining a new father and mother...

857
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:22,304
in addition to her own.

858
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:26,103
How happy she is.

859
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:28,838
Her new father examines
her milky chest.

860
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:33,382
He is pleased that his grandchildren
will be well fed.

861
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:36,442
Another hurdle overcome.

862
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:42,523
- God, you are so pretty.
- You're so pretty too.

863
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:45,220
That's a horrible thing
to say to a guy.

864
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:48,196
I'm handsome.
I'm maybe cute.

865
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:51,290
- And very, very pretty.
- Oh, yeah?

866
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:53,801
What if I do this?

867
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,172
Yuck!

868
00:57:58,241 --> 00:58:00,675
I think we know who the pretty one is
in this relationship.

869
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:02,836
Oh, yeah?
What if I do this?

870

00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:07,406
Okay, then I would have
to do this.

871
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,184
Yeah? Well, I'll have
to do this.

872
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:16,157
Oh, yeah?
Then I would do this.

873
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:22,858
That one's pretty good.

874
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:25,093
- It better be because it's real.
- Oh, God.

875
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:28,069
Oh, boy. Ohh!

876
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:34,072
"Sperminator"--
protector of the uterus.

877
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,805
- Bye, Jen. Have a nice weekend.
- You too.

878
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,355
- Here you go.
- Thanks. It's Mr. Hatfield...

879
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:52,758
- from Entertel.
- Damn. Can you just tell him I left...

880
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:55,559
and the reports were faxed to him
about five minutes ago?

881
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:58,123
-Jenny, that is dishonest.
- Please?

882
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,567
Me and Billy are going to Montelido
in a half an hour...

883
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:04,596
- and I haven't even packed yet.
- What's Montelido?

884
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,539
It's in central California.
An old hippie town.

885
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:09,100
Billy's friend has
a house in the woods...

886
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:10,736
and he lent it to us
for the weekend.

887
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:13,176
Please?

888
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:17,111
Mr. Hatfield?
I'm sorry. She just left.

889
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:20,053
But she wanted me to tell you
that she faxed your reports.

890
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,926
Yeah, everybody's left.

891
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,095
Is your wife still there?

892
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:32,124
The male and female
go to the woods...

893
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:35,568
planning to mate
in their natural habitat.

894
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:37,435
The female is anxious.

895
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:39,407
She knows the burden
motherhood will bear.

896
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:43,104
Relax. It's not like we have to
be there at a specific time.

897
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:46,945
We said we'd leave by 8:00.
It's 8:30. I hate being late.

898
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:49,541
- You're always late.
- Doesn't mean I like it.

899
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:51,416
Come on, Jen. Relax.

900
00:59:51,487 --> 00:59:54,479
- We're going there to have a good time.
- I know that.

901
00:59:54,557 --> 00:59:58,823
So don't put any pressure on yourself.
If we're late, we're late. So what?

902
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:03,093
I suppose you're right.

903
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:09,632
- Well, that's it. I'm ready.
- Great.

904
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:11,970
I feel like
I forgot something.

905
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:15,306
Oh, don't worry. Everyone feels
like that when they travel.

906
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:17,846
Yeah, but I really feel
like I forgot something.

907
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:20,109
Then we'll rough it.
That's what the woods are for.

908
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:22,117
- Don't worry. It'll be fine.
- If you say so.

909
01:00:22,185 --> 01:00:23,812
Trust me.

910
01:00:24,854 --> 01:00:27,948
How could you forget
Your diaphragm?

911
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:30,492
I told you I forgot something.
You said it didn't matter.

912
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,790
- You said we could rough it.
- You can't rough that.

913
01:00:32,862 --> 01:00:36,958
Ready to mate, male and female
discuss the virtues of parenthood.

914

01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:39,763
- You can always pull out.
- That's a little too rough for me.

915
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:43,272
So this is all my fault?
You're not willing to sacrifice?

916
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:45,899
I'd love to promise to,
but I wouldn't be able to.

917
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:49,968
You're the most beautiful thing in the
world and I'm a stupid, horny schmuck.

918
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:52,207
Be realistic.

919
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:55,648
Well, I guess that's that.

920
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:57,208
Want to play cards?

921
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:02,821
You know, there are
Other ways to rough it.

922
01:01:02,892 --> 01:01:04,416
How?

923
01:01:09,432 --> 01:01:11,366
Bracey ourself.

924
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:31,510
As mating grows ever nearer...

925
01:01:31,587 --> 01:01:35,921
the male uses his tongue
to explore the female's womb...

926
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:39,257
clearing the passageway of any debris
so that the infant will have...

927
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:41,319
an easy voyage into their world.

928
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,590
Oh, God!

929
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:47,397
It is painful for her...

930
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:50,064
but for the good of their child,
she makes the sacrifice.

931
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:52,607
So this is nature?

932
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:54,609
Ooh, nature's good.

933
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:28,836
Young humans often have difficulty
discussing the mating dance...

934
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,674
with those more elderly.

935
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:33,011
- Can I help you?
- Here, an embarrassed male...

936
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,744
tries to secure
from the old, wise woman...

937
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:40,482
a slice of vulcanized vegetation
to place on his seed shooter.

938
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:42,581
Do you have any--

939
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:49,421
You know, condoms?

940
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:52,832
Oh, sure.
We got ketchup, mustard.

941
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:55,462
My man Thor makes
a mean homemade marmalade.

942
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:59,030
No, not condiments,
but condoms.

943
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:02,103
Prophylactics.

944
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:05,244
Male birth control?

945
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:10,284
Rubbers.
Why didn't you say so?

946
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:13,948
Of course we sell rubbers.
What do you think we are, backwards?

947
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:16,491
Great. Let's see.
That's three in a pack.

948
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:20,723
We're here for another day.
We'll take two packs.

949
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:23,595
- We'll take five packs.
- I don't have that many left.

950
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:26,829
- We'll take whatever you got.
- That'd be none.

951
01:03:26,903 --> 01:03:29,497
Those rubbers sell
like hotcakes up here.

952
01:03:29,572 --> 01:03:31,904
Do you have anything?

953
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:34,374
Diaphragm, sponge?

954
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:36,911
- The pill?
- They don't have that here.

955
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:38,970
Funny thing
about that expression.

956
01:03:39,048 --> 01:03:41,983
Hotcakes never sold
near as good as rubbers.

957
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:46,215
The expression should be,
"Sells like rubbers."

958
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:48,416
Who needs hotcakes?

959
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,959
- Is there a store nearby?
- Nope.

960
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:56,226
Ever since the government unleashed AIDS
on our unwitting society...

961
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:58,529
those rubbers have
sold like rubbers.

962
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:04,367
Well, thanks a lot for your help,
and I guess we'll see you soon.

963
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,431
Yeah, real soon.

964
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,205
Unbeknownst to the male and female,
the old, wise woman...

965
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:11,872
is really a citizen
of the planet Pierkov.

966
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:17,514
Who would have thought there's
not a store in the entire area...

967
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:19,521
where you can buy a condom?

968
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:24,686
- Well, this is nice anyway.
- Yeah, it is.

969
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,785
Kind of reminds me
Of when we were first dating...

970
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:30,026
just holding each other,
not being able to do anything.

971
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:33,865
Yeah, only then we didn't
Know whatwe were missing.

972
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:35,927
-What are you saying?
- I can't stand it.

973
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:37,404
Good answer.

974
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:39,134
- We should be okay.
- Yeah, I'll pull out.

975
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:42,109
- It's a safe time in my cycle.
- I'll pull out.

976
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:44,646
Some people never use anything at all,
and nothing ever happens.

977
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:47,239
- I'll pull out.
- You said you couldn't do that.

978
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:49,716
- I thought you said I'm too beautiful.
- But look at you.

979
01:04:49,785 --> 01:04:52,720
You're not wearing makeup.
Your hair's a mess. You're a skank.

980
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:54,415
You sweet talker, you.

981
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,935
Now, this is mating.

982
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:12,705
More than a year
After they have met...

983
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:15,403
a year of practice
and preparation...

984
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:19,312
countless other humans guiding them

and keeping them on track...

985
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:22,476
reproduction
is ready to take place.

986
01:06:24,747 --> 01:06:26,544
Conception!

987
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:37,255
- I think we're all right.
- Absolutely.

988
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:44,661
But believe it or not,
the mating dance is still not complete.

989
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:47,828
Conception is only
an important stage for humans.

990
01:06:47,903 --> 01:06:50,394
Much can still go wrong.

991
01:06:51,807 --> 01:06:53,570
I think that's the one.

992
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:56,909
It's nothing.
All that clean air in the woods...

993
01:06:56,979 --> 01:06:59,470
just threw off my cycle,
that's all.

994
01:06:59,548 --> 01:07:02,039
Then the test will show negative.
At least this way you'll know.

995
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:05,451
- I already know.
- Then what are you worried about?

996
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:08,183
You just shouldn't
have bought me the test.

997
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:11,749
Billy should have bought you the test,
But you don't have the guts to tell him.

998
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:13,761
There's nothing to tell him.

999
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,996
There's something to tell him.

1000
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:26,498
I'm pregnant.

1001
01:07:26,575 --> 01:07:28,600
I'm gonna be a mother.

1002
01:07:30,946 --> 01:07:33,642
I'm gonna be a mother!

1003
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:45,317
The itsy-bitsy spider
went up the waterspout

1004
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:49,421
Down came the rain
And was hed the spider out

1005
01:07:49,498 --> 01:07:52,626
Good morning, Mom.
Hey! What smells so good?

1006
01:07:52,701 --> 01:07:56,137
Your lunch, son.
Tuna fish on whole wheat and fruit...

1007
01:07:56,205 --> 01:08:00,039
so you'll grow up
healthy and strong.

1008
01:08:00,109 --> 01:08:02,509
My favorite!
I love you, Mom.

1009
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:05,308
I love you, Billy Junior.

1010
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:12,414
Hi, honey. 

I'm off to work.

1011
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:14,718
- Have a nice day, sweetheart.
- Bye, Daddy!

1012
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:17,725
- Who do we have here?
- I'm your child.

1013
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:20,819
- No, I don't have a child.
- Yes, you do.

1014
01:08:20,896 --> 01:08:24,798
No, I pulled out, remember?
Sorry, little boy, but I pulled out.

1015
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:26,164
- No, you didn't.
- Did.

1016
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:27,167
- Didn't.
- Did.

1017
01:08:27,236 --> 01:08:28,669
- Didn't.
- Did.

1018
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:30,500
- Didn't.
- Did.

1019
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:32,268
- What are you saying?
- Did.

1020
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:34,468
Billy!

1021
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:36,704
Look, I refuse to accept this.

1022
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:40,442
You're gonna have to accept it,
because it's true.

1023
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:43,542
No! I will never accept it!

1024
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,143
Never!

1025
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:57,291
I'm gonna be a mother.

1026
01:08:57,366 --> 01:09:00,494
The female is thrilled by
The prospect of her motherhood.

1027
01:09:00,569 --> 01:09:02,503
You'll be okay.

1028
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:08,568
What am I gonna do?

1029
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:10,771
How am I gonna tell Billy?

1030
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:14,679
Billy, we're pregnant.

1031
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:17,909
I'm pregnant.

1032
01:09:19,588 --> 01:09:22,182
Remember when you said
you'd pull out?

1033
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:24,249
You bastard!

1034
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:28,187
Listen, you're not alone.

1035
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:31,529
We're totally gonna be here for you.
It's gonna be fine.

1036
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,534
Nervous about
the male's reaction...

1037
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:35,763
the female tries to mate
with her own pack...

1038
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:37,829
but that's a whole other movie.

1039
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,871
The female conveys the good news.

1040
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:44,378
Their efforts
have proven fruitful.

1041
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:46,380
I 'm pregnant.

1042
01:09:51,053 --> 01:09:52,611
Whoa.

1043
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:58,285
Whoa.

1044

01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,794
The human male now
does a peculiar thing...

1045
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:03,559
indigenous to
those of his species.

1046
01:10:03,632 --> 01:10:05,566
After months of mating...

1047
01:10:05,634 --> 01:10:08,933
he determines he is not interested
in the dance he has danced.

1048
01:10:09,004 --> 01:10:12,735
He has not mated. He never met her.
What's her name?

1049
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:15,307
Say something.

1050
01:10:19,515 --> 01:10:22,109
It is mine, isn't it?

1051
01:10:22,184 --> 01:10:24,584
Say something better.

1052
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:26,985
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
That was wrong.

1053
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:28,990
Of course it's mine.

1054
01:10:30,793 --> 01:10:31,725
Whoa.

1055
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:38,025
Okay, okay.
I got to stay strong here.

1056
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:41,126
I gotta do the honorable thing.

1057
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:47,165
I'm gonna do the honorable thing.

1058
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:49,837
"I'm gonna do the honorable thing"?

1059
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:52,073
What is that?
Some kind of pity proposal?

1060
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:55,776
I've waited my whole life
for a man to ask me to marry him.

1061
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:58,149
But I sure as hell
don't need your pity proposal.

1062
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,746
By honorable thing, I meant
I was going to pay for the abortion.

1063
01:11:01,824 --> 01:11:02,916
What?

1064
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:05,256
If you don't want my pity proposal,
I understand.

1065
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:07,921
I don't believe you.

1066
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:10,625
- What do you want me to do?
- I don't know!

1067
01:11:10,699 --> 01:11:12,929
I just wanted you to be
happy about this.

1068
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:15,527
I wanted you to p--

1069
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:17,639
Forget it.

1070
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:22,041
So you do want me to propose.

1071
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:26,445
Pussy, pussy, whipped, whipped.
Pussy, pussy, whipped, whipped.

1072
01:11:26,515 --> 01:11:28,642
The male is trapped.

1073
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:32,551
You planned this thing real well, Jen.
Real well.

1074
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:35,215
What? I didn't plan anything.

1075
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,191
You've been calling the shots
from the beginning.

1076
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:39,193
"Let's get an AIDS test.
Let's go meet my family."

1077
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:41,525
They embark upon the uniquely
human characteristic...

1078
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:44,191
of saying things
they will later regret...

1079
01:11:44,266 --> 01:11:47,133
one of the more dangerous steps
of the mating dance.

1080
01:11:47,202 --> 01:11:50,797
You asshole.
God, I thought you were a nice guy.

1081
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:52,864
Come on. Deny it.
Look me in the eye...

1082
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:56,377
and tell me this wasn't some part
of a grand scheme to trap me.

1083
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:58,504
- In the eye?
- In the eye.

1084
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:02,175
- Get out of my home.
- Yeah. That's what I thought.

1085
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:12,588
The male retreats to
the comfort of the pack.

1086
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:14,492
Only with his own kind,
he knows...

1087
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:17,430
can he be safe
and healthy and strong.

1088
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:20,434
It's, like, I don't even
have a choice anymore.

1089
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:24,336
It's gotta be her way
or the highway.

1090
01:12:24,406 --> 01:12:26,772
Well, I don't take to ultimatums.

1091
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:29,709
No man does.

1092
01:12:29,778 --> 01:12:31,973
And I'm sure as hell
not ready to get married.

1093
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:33,844
- No man is.
- No man.

1094
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:37,044
They force him to consume
large amounts of fermented grain...

1095
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:38,609
in an attempt to kill him.

1096
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:41,986
Unwilling to mate, he is no longer
Of any use to their species.

1097
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:46,118
Since it ended, I got this feeling
in my stomach...

1098
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,129
Like an empty pit...

1099
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:51,223
Like, I don't even know--

1100
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:54,531
I don't even know
how to live anymore.

1101
01:12:54,603 --> 01:12:57,401
I know. I know.
Now, drink up.

1102
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:04,742
The male tries to
validate his existence...

1103
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:07,941
and prove he doesn't
need a female to mate.

1104
01:13:08,016 --> 01:13:10,450
He attempts to devolve
into a hermaphrodite...

1105
01:13:10,519 --> 01:13:13,682
and give birth
to offspring on his own.

1106
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:16,657
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1107
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:20,320
For the male, this will prove
ultimately unfulfilling.

1108
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:23,263
Although genetically equipped
to deliver the placenta...

1109
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:27,132
he is unable to produce
the infant itself.

1110
01:13:27,202 --> 01:13:30,933
The female retreats to the comfort
Of her pack as well.

1111
01:13:31,006 --> 01:13:33,031
Now expectant mother...

1112

01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:36,441
it is within her power alone
to erase the past year...

1113
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:40,243
or allow the mating dance
to come to fruition.

1114
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:45,776
I mean, there is no way I'll bring
that asshole's baby into this world.

1115
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:48,755
Listen, if you want to do this,
we'll back you up.

1116
01:13:48,824 --> 01:13:52,316
We'll take you there,
but don't do this because of him.

1117
01:13:52,394 --> 01:13:56,524
- Do it because it's what you want.
- I don't know what I want.

1118
01:13:56,598 --> 01:14:00,193
I definitely don't want
another one of him running around.

1119
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,100
So what time?

1120
01:14:03,338 --> 01:14:06,205
No, I've got to do this myself.

1121
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:08,300
Oh, honey.

1122
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:10,504
The dance ends.

1123
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:14,140
It is as if the male andt he female
Never crossed tracks.

1124
01:14:15,317 --> 01:14:19,378
Appreciating the male's futile attempt
to devolve into a hermaphrodite...

1125
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:24,051
the pack welcomes him back in
with support and sympathy over his loss.

1126
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:27,323
You did the right thing.
I mean, she--

1127
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:29,626
She was playing you
for a sucker the whole time.

1128
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:31,598
- I don't know.
- Come on, man.

1129
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:34,659
You saw the guys she went out with.
What would she want with you...

1130
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:37,296
other than the fact that you're
the only one who would stick around...

1131
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:40,136
after her biological
alarm clock buzzed?

1132
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:42,700
Now the joke's on her.

1133
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:46,077
I suppose. I mean...

1134
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:49,675
I knew she was out of my league
from the moment I first saw her.

1135
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:52,345
- She's beautiful.
- Exactly.

1136
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:55,254
- And smart.
- Right.

1137
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:59,124
Kind, caring...

1138
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:02,686
supportive, successful.

1139
01:15:02,764 --> 01:15:05,028
My point is made.

1140
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,159
And I love her.

1141
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:08,897
Maybe you didn't
get my point after all.

1142
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:12,065
What am I, crazy? She's the greatest
Thing that ever happened to me.

1143
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:14,734
She's the greatest thing that ever will
happen to me. I've got to talk to her.

1144
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:17,904
I gotta beg her into taking me back,
whatever it takes.

1145
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:20,175
Don't let her talk you
into getting married.

1146
01:15:20,249 --> 01:15:22,012
I'm not going to let her
talk me into getting married.

1147
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:26,714
-I'm going to talk her into marrying me.
-You're falling for it!

1148
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:30,747
I fell a long time ago.
I was just too stupid to realize it.

1149
01:15:30,826 --> 01:15:34,660
- I'm outta here.
-Just hear me out first, all right?

1150
01:15:38,934 --> 01:15:41,300
Congratulations, man.

1151
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:44,100
The two of you make
a wonderful couple.

1152
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:46,470
- I thought you were against it.
- I'm your friend.

1153
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:50,069
- Whatever you want, I want.
-Thanks, man.

1154
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:52,170
You'll make a great daddy.

1155
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:54,374
Now, go.

1156
01:16:08,597 --> 01:16:11,088
- What do you want, asshole?
- Where's Jenny?

1157
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:14,101
- That's none of your business, prick.
- I gotta talk to her.

1158
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:16,967
Well, she's not
talking to you, dick wad.

1159
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:20,008
Fine. Then I'll wait here
until she gets back.

1160
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:22,009
Fine.
She'll be back in a week.

1161
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:24,170
Lock up at the end
Of the night, scumbag.

1162
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:33,119
What is your problem?

1163
01:16:33,188 --> 01:16:35,986
I checked home; she's not home.
I checked here; she's not here.

1164
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:37,650
I screwed up.
I want to fix things.

1165
01:16:37,726 --> 01:16:40,957
I suppose you want to marry her
now, huh? Ya freakazoid!

1166
01:16:41,029 --> 01:16:45,591
Yes, and I want you to be the maid of
honor because of your warmth and charm.

1167
01:16:46,802 --> 01:16:49,600
- You really wanna marry her?
- Go away.

1168
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:53,507
- Really, really?
- Leave me alone.

1169
01:16:54,843 --> 01:16:57,243
Oh, God.

1170

01:16:57,312 --> 01:16:59,940
Oh, God. This is one
Of those crisis moments.

1171
01:17:00,015 --> 01:17:02,176
What would Jenny
want me to do?

1172
01:17:07,322 --> 01:17:10,291
Okay, I'm gonna tell you where she is.
But if you go and she gets upset...

1173
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:13,055
you have to tell her you just guessed.

1174
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:16,291
But if you go there and she's happy
to see you, you can tell her it was me.

1175
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:18,799
I'll tell her I like you
If you tell me where she is.

1176
01:17:18,867 --> 01:17:22,394
Okay. She really hated your guts
Because you were a prick.

1177
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,837
Like so many others before her...

1178
01:17:24,906 --> 01:17:26,897
this female joins
the mating dance...

1179
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:29,500
and helps the male
arrive at its completion.

1180
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:31,569
Oh, my God!

1181
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:47,420
Move it! Come on!

1182
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,225
Let's go, lady!
Let's go!

1183
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:50,559
God!

1184
01:17:53,902 --> 01:17:55,733
What?

1185
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:40,413
Hello! Hello? Hell--

1186
01:18:40,482 --> 01:18:42,575
Oh, hi. I need to see
Jenny Smith right away.

1187
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:45,051
- I'm sorry, sir. You can't go in--
- It doesn't matter.

1188
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:48,055
The large female tells
the male he is too late.

1189
01:18:48,123 --> 01:18:52,719
The past has been erased.
The mating dance did not take place.

1190
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:56,329
Fuck.

1191
01:19:13,215 --> 01:19:17,015
There are no human sounds
to express the sadness felt...

1192
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:20,213
by the entire species

on the verge of extinction.

1193
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:27,626
- Thank you.
-Jenny?

1194
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:30,164
What are you doing here?

1195
01:19:30,232 --> 01:19:32,291
Never mind that.

1196
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:42,040
Look, I'm sorry
I forced you here.

1197
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:46,240
I'm sorry I wasn't with you.
I'm sorry about everything I said.

1198
01:19:46,314 --> 01:19:48,839
But I want you in my life.

1199
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:51,249
With or without a child,
I want you in my life...

1200
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:53,287
for the rest of my life.

1201
01:19:53,355 --> 01:19:57,348
I--you know--

1202
01:19:58,527 --> 01:20:01,860
I need you.

1203
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:05,889
I love you.

I love you.

1204
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:09,334
I love you more than anything.

1205
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:11,929
We'll make another kid
If you want.

1206
01:20:12,007 --> 01:20:15,807
Not that that'll make up for it, and
If you don't want to, you don't have to.

1207
01:20:15,877 --> 01:20:17,902
It's up to you.
Whatever you want.

1208
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:21,073
We can start planning that big wedding
you always wanted.

1209
01:20:21,149 --> 01:20:23,413
Just say that you'll marry me.

1210
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:28,483
I couldn't go through with it.

1211
01:20:28,557 --> 01:20:30,548
But the nurse said
That you were already--

1212
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:33,924
At the last minute I figured that
you've been great for this whole year.

1213
01:20:33,995 --> 01:20:36,589
You only messed up once.

1214
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:39,828
I do want another
one of you in this world...

1215
01:20:39,901 --> 01:20:42,995
especially if it's got
a little bit of me mixed in it.

1216
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:48,108
Still want to get married?

1217
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:53,271
Okay. You?

1218
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:56,278
Okay.

1219
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:14,426
As a final symbol,
the male and female cement...

1220
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:16,902
the completion of the mating ritual.

1221
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:19,236
Gathering together
the entire pack...

1222
01:21:19,307 --> 01:21:21,468
the male and female
must first bore...

1223
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:25,377
then feed all who participated
in the great dance.

1224
01:22:21,169 --> 01:22:26,436
A human male speaks of the couple's
undying love for one another.

1225
01:22:26,508 --> 01:22:29,966
No one knows this person,
but they pay him well for his thoughts.

1226
01:22:31,713 --> 01:22:35,046
The pack rejoices at the male
and female's good fortune...

1227
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:37,482
and at their own good fortune...

1228
01:22:37,552 --> 01:22:40,715
for the species has been propagated--
humanity will live on.

1229
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:45,491
And as a testimony of
their affection for one another...

1230
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:49,052
the male and female make promises
they don't know if they can keep.

1231
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:51,997
- I do.
- I do.

1232
01:22:52,067 --> 01:22:55,901
They make speeches that sound
like sweet roses in bloom...

1233
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:58,531
before they die and
get all crinkly and yucky.

1234
01:22:58,606 --> 01:23:01,666
I don't know why
you've chosen me.

1235
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:04,177
I only know that I will spend
the remainder of my days...

1236
01:23:04,245 --> 01:23:06,679
trying to prove
my worthiness...

1237
01:23:06,748 --> 01:23:09,546
even though no one could
ever be truly worthy of you.

1238
01:23:10,552 --> 01:23:15,251
I will love you,
cherish you and nurture you.

1239
01:23:15,323 --> 01:23:20,317
For without you, my life
is empty and my soul is barren.

1240
01:23:20,395 --> 01:23:25,833
I will stay with you
and keep you with me for all eternity.

1241
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:31,202
Forever and ever and--
Uh-oh.

1242
01:23:31,272 --> 01:23:34,764
Get away from me, you bastard!

1243
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:40,008
"I'll pull out," my ass!
Fuck you! Fuckin' prick!

1244
01:23:40,081 --> 01:23:42,549
And at long last...

1245
01:23:42,617 --> 01:23:46,951
the female experiences
the joy and pleasure of birth.

1246
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:50,185
It is a euphoric
experience for her.

1247
01:23:50,258 --> 01:23:52,726
Having had to suffer
the pain of orgasm...

1248
01:23:52,794 --> 01:23:55,592
she is now entitled
to reap nature's reward.

1249
01:23:55,663 --> 01:23:57,392
Fuckin' piece of shit!

1250
01:23:57,465 --> 01:24:01,526
It is a state of ecstasy
the male will never enjoy.

1251
01:24:01,603 --> 01:24:02,934
Breathe, honey.
Just breathe.

1252
01:24:03,004 --> 01:24:06,201
The female attempts to describe
her euphoria to her true love.

1253
01:24:06,274 --> 01:24:09,072
- Breathe.
- You breathe, motherfucker!

1254
01:24:09,144 --> 01:24:13,103
- Breathe. Just keep breathing.
- Fuck you! Oh, fuck you!

1255
01:24:13,181 --> 01:24:14,580
Fuck!

1256
01:24:14,649 --> 01:24:18,449
The mating habits
Of the earthbound human.

1257
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:21,580
From meeting in a bar
to conceiving on a floor...

1258
01:24:21,656 --> 01:24:23,453
to proposing
in an abortion clinic...

1259
01:24:23,525 --> 01:24:27,586
so it goes with
all earthbound humans.

1260
01:24:27,662 --> 01:24:30,460
With a mating ritual
so complex and intricate...

1261
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:33,228
that their mere survival
defies all logic...

1262
01:24:33,301 --> 01:24:38,136
one can only feel for them
a sense of respect and admiration.

1263
01:24:38,206 --> 01:24:40,572
So let's not blow up
Their planet after all.

1264
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:45,112
They don't like the looks
ofthe child, so they beat it.

1265
01:24:46,548 --> 01:24:47,845
Thank you.

1266
01:24:50,151 --> 01:24:52,381
Please turn off your
universal translator...

1267
01:24:52,454 --> 01:24:54,581
and mate according to your own custom.
