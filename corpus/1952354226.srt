00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,179
<i>I met him at sunday
and my heart stood still.</i>

2
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:21,179
<i>Hello.</i>

3
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,273
<i>I'm Dean.</i>

4
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:25,373
<i>I'm Pablo.</i>

5
00:00:27,017 --> 00:00:29,017
<i>Hi, Pablo.</i>

6
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,676
<i>And to where will you follow me?</i>

7
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,867
<i>It was lust at first sight.</i>

8
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:21,832
<i>You were fantastic.</i>

9
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,419
<i>No, you were fantastic.</i>

10
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,257
<i>You're right,
I was fantastic.</i>

11
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,467
<i>Us.</i>

12
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:53,697
<i>Pablo: the one-night stand
no longer left.</i>

13
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:14,927
<i>The next ten months were
a real chamois sweet romantic movie.</i>

14
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,700
<i>And I was damn America's sweetheart.</i>

15
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,882
<i>Pablo said first 'I love you.</i>

16
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,177
<i>On his own special way.</i>

17
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,351
<i>And it burned so good.</i>

18
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,324
<i>Deans would not cure sunburn?</i>

19
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,327
<i>Pablo will ever stop snoring?</i>

20
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,107
<i>Will love conquer all?</i>

21
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,251
<i>(Hint: yes.)</i>

22
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,044
<i>Not wegzappen.</i>

23
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,557
Pablo, okay?

24
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,642
I hate this song.

25
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,316
Sign me why you always?

26
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,733
For the evidence.

27
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,943
What?

28
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,740
Because I know you still do not bite me.

29
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,158
Yes.

30
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:05,619
Here I am.

31
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,755
I'm going nowhere.

32
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:40,030
<i>TWO WEEKS LATER</i>

33
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,506
Dean, friend, where is your better half?

34
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,925
He could not come.

35
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,478
Dean.

36
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:16,857
How are you?

37
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,445
You were still quit smoking?
- Was I.

38
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:22,696
This is Marshall, the artist.

39
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,365
Marshall.
- Hi, Louise.

40
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,912
I can not just my eyes
off your work...

41
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,079
not fast enough.

42
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:36,628
The critics tear him alive.
Ah, what? That's great.

43
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,698
I want you to meet his dealer.

44
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:43,010
Hey, Dean. Pablo is here?
- No.

45
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,578
Nice haircut.

46
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,330
Which dealer?

47
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,557
His art dealer
- I write comics.

48
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,227
You create graphic novels, Dean.

49
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,688
And these are ten times better than this.

50
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,772
I want to stay small.

51
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,594
Too late.

52
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:04,656
<i>The Speed Freak has your name
published. There is no turning back.</i>

53
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,584
My God.

54
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,920
Stay calm...

55
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,839
What? Who is that?

56
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,451
That is his mother.

57
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,720
Whose mother?
- From Pablo.

58
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:30,265
That subtle?
I thought she lived in Argentina.

59
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,266
Pablo to be here.

60
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:39,091
Ask me to it. I want to know where
she has her shoes away.

61
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:41,818
Louise.
I think Pablo nowhere.

62
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,319
Mr. Otten House.

63
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:48,989
I would like to introduce you...
- I can easily just 'hello' to say.

64
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,248
Mrs. Alesandro?

65
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,727
Mrs. Alesandro. It's me, Dean...

66
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,070
How long have you been in Los Angeles?

67
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:30,058
I think not her mother-Friendly
language, but Bitch. And they also talk Cunt.

68
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,810
She also speaks fluent German.

69
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,081
Dean. This is Marshall's dealer,
Mr. Otten House.

70
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,584
Did I not tell you that he is dangerous?

71
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,629
He just says "Cunt" in public.
That is borderline.

72
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,716
Pleasant introduction. Excuse me.

73
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:50,554
The last time she was in LA,
she even ate at my house.

74
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:52,806
I really like your work would like to see.

75
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,394
My heart is bursting.

76
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:01,815
It's okay.
Join now to return the old Dean.

77
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,734
Good?

78
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,638
Stop this nonsense.

79
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:11,158
I have my best to you
get together here.

80
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:12,935
Fucked it.

81
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:14,895
He's gone.

82
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,581
What are you talking about?
- Pablo. He is gone.

83
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,526
One night he went out cigarettes
and he has not returned.

84
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:23,587
I would love to talk with him
but I can not find it.

85
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:36,432
Mrs. Alesandro, find a nice
performance? - Leave me alone.

86
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,919
Excuse me.

87
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,019
Maybe you could help me.

88
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,631
I have him with me things that Pablo
has left,...

89
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,401
shoes, what post
my heart.

90
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:47,761
Keep everything but.

91
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,721
I think he does terugwil.

92
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,821
I think not.

93
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:58,330
Please.
- He's back where he belongs.

94
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:02,317
I saw him just another restaurant
see a doggy bag to go outside.

95
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:05,337
You do not ask doggy bag
if you're going to leave the country?

96
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,713
I hope you have fun.

97
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,094
Where is he?
- Damn.

98
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:17,307
If I pull that language from you and insert
them in your ass.

99
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,935
Let me go.

100
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,435
Damn.

101
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,149
Sorry.

102
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:37,578
You're such an idiot.

103
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,314
He is finished with you.

104
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:43,458
Tomorrow we return to Buenos Aires...

105
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,879
and you will never look back.

106
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,045
What? Speak English.

107
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,576
What did she say?

108
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,926
Does anyone understand it?
Something happens tomorrow?

109
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,348
She said that tomorrow the sun comes up again, Dean.

110
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,834
And she had a blouse where her
big tits hanging out.

111
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,934
What have I told you about her?

112
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,105
Logical that Pablo is so fucked up.

113
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:32,216
<i>Dean, it's Louise. I hate you.</i>

114
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,159
<i>I spent two hours...</i>

115
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:39,014
<i>to me by Mr. Otten to House
excuse because you've screwed up.</i>

116
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:43,268
<i>You have 'Hot-How-She-It-Again'
almost raped in the middle of his gallery.</i>

117
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:48,065
<i>So I told him that you
're retarded. And he believed me.</i>

118
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:51,401
<i>Please let me in between.
Thank you.</i>

119
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:53,944
<i>Dean, this is my proposal.</i>

120
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:56,532
<i>The pages you yesterday
have returned...</i>

121
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:59,535
<i>are a big step backwards.</i>

122
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,745
<i>I do not know what happened.</i>

123
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,912
<i>Pablo who has sucked out your heart?</i>

124
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:07,793
<i>Anyway, get over it
are, and do not come back sooner.</i>

125
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:37,781
Are you the one who always stays calls?

126
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,725
I just want to know...
- I understand completely.

127
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,825
Pablo was superb.

128
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,420
I was completely off the map when they
told me that he is no longer working.

129
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,277
I've seen him once.

130
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,570
Pablo?

131
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,965
He staapte in his Volkswagen,
his stupid red bug.

132
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:58,462
Do you know how hard it is to
someone to suck in a beetle? - No.

133
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,683
I have writer's block.
- Writers Block?

134
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:09,186
Here's your writer's block.

135
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,261
Taxi?

136
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,728
That's a good idea.

137
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,569
Hopefully...

138
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:06,553
Hi.

139
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,890
Mrs. Alesandro, you know me?

140
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:13,170
I had the last time you want
say that I would come here...

141
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,864
but you did not really make much sense to have
to chat.

142
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:18,072
Pablo is here?

143
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,416
Shit...

144
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:43,550
Not speak Spanish... I just go away.

145
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:47,302
Drive.

146
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,904
Where is there a hotel?
You know, a Hilton or...

147
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:06,573
Or take me to a Ritz Carlton,
please.

148
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,990
Ritz?
- Yes, Ritz.

149
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:11,785
That will be correct.

150
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:24,798
Do you speak any English?

151
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,469
English? No.

152
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,679
I am sorry

153
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:53,535
Very nice.

154
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,047
Very nice.

155
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:12,395
Do you know where I can find one this Forum?
- Yes.

156
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:16,977
No, that's very kind of you,
but...

157
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:19,605
I am two weeks ago stopped smoking.

158
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:23,400
A joint, weed, shit ,...?

159
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:40,165
Later.
- I agree later.

160
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:45,921
Hey, wait.

161
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:56,208
Thank you.

162
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:58,308
You're welcome.

163
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:19,022
What?

164
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:21,122
Hello?

165
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:28,525
Sorry, I thought you were somebody else.

166
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:15,237
Do you speak English?

167
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:19,284
Two words only: "We're closed."

168
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:26,299
That's three... words.

169
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:33,964
Can I help you?

170
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:38,802
I've been in the scouts.

171
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:42,641
You must know more than three words.
You said...

172
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:44,808
"I only know two words',...

173
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:46,935
what al ..

174
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:49,648
That is a whole sentence.

175
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:52,524
We're closed.

176
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:56,446
You know more than two words,
but this is it your favorite.

177
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:03,912
Okay, I already do can you tell me...

178
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:07,831
Have you seen this guy?

179
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:14,588
He seems bored.

180
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,034
He was tired.

181
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:19,249
We had all night
celebrated my birthday.

182
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:24,683
Well, you had to see him...

183
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:27,853
I stay at the Ritz Hotel.

184
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:30,604
On the Avenida de Mayo?

185
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:32,816
You should have seen him already.

186
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:35,819
His family lives in that house, so there.

187
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:37,846
I do not see much.

188
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:40,282
That is a political family.

189
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:43,911
Very rich, very powerful and very...

190
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,372
anonymous.

191
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:53,723
You know many words
I can not count them.

192
00:20:57,633 --> 00:20:59,633
We're closed.

193
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:40,192
You are the...

194
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:47,784
Guillermo, will you help me?

195
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,080
Come here.

196
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:02,382
Listen. I do not understand what she says.

197
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,916
What?

198
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:13,016
Not good.

199
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:16,144
Not good.

200
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:37,646
Where is that little of yesterday?

201
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:39,746
Coming with me.

202
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:44,795
Mrs. Alesandro, how are you?
I'm Sergeant Montego.

203
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:47,506
Keep this bastard away from my house.

204
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:51,301
If you would like scolding me so...

205
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:53,628
I therefore order that the nerve
in English to do.

206
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:55,971
Take him.

207
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:02,894
Hands off.

208
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:06,233
If you do not immediately leave the country,...

209
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:09,546
I make you regret that you
my son have ever met.

210
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:11,945
July 25?
I do al

211
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:15,574
Stop, please.

212
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,160
You know him?

213
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:20,807
I am sure that we
can solve, right?

214
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:25,919
It must be better that people are not
know who he is looking for.

215
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:28,755
You rule this problem then.

216
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:32,966
Go away.

217
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:33,652
Not to.

218
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,290
What?

219
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,143
Are you English or American?
- American.

220
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,520
I said I thought that a good book.

221
00:28:49,855 --> 00:28:53,025
It is sometimes difficult to read
if you do not speak Spanish.

222
00:29:43,784 --> 00:29:45,911
Relax, I'm not scene.

223
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:53,583
Thanks for earlier.

224
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:58,423
That is mine.
I mean, I got it written.

225
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:01,927
So I look like I slept.

226
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:09,226
I'm not an asshole. I have
heartbreak and I need help.

227
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:18,191
I 'm signatures for you.

228
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:24,074
What's your name?
- Sofia.

229
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,410
So...

230
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:33,167
... fia.

231
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:36,334
Okay.

232
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:48,599
Ever done something that you hoped
that would change your life?

233
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:52,266
Nothing changes your life,
you change your life.

234
00:30:55,981 --> 00:30:58,906
When this came out I thought I
it would be easier...

235
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:01,721
I finally had to show them what I could.

236
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:05,322
But the truth is that...

237
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:07,949
once I had them show...

238
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:10,996
I no longer knew myself.

239
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:13,413
I was lost.

240
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:17,336
And then I came to Pablo.

241
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:20,297
That boy who is bored in that picture.

242
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:25,536
He changed everything.

243
00:31:25,636 --> 00:31:28,430
I will tell you one thing:
He does not live in that house.

244
00:31:28,597 --> 00:31:30,249
I'm here every day.

245
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:32,392
He's probably in their country house.

246
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,502
Where are these people going
to get away from it all?

247
00:31:34,602 --> 00:31:36,613
They have no home in Malibu or something?

248
00:31:36,897 --> 00:31:38,424
Forget him, Dean.

249
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:43,111
Go to the Casa Rosada, the tango
dancers look and go back home, okay?

250
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,097
I do not know where that is.

251
00:31:45,197 --> 00:31:47,197
There is not a Malibu or something.

252
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:58,502
You know each other?

253
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:03,588
Sorry, I can not help you, Dean.

254
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:08,345
You forgot this in the shop.

255
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:15,060
Want to know a secret?

256
00:32:17,688 --> 00:32:19,688
I have written this.

257
00:32:20,524 --> 00:32:23,610
Want to know my secret?
I've read it.

258
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:26,361
You're kidding.
- No.

259
00:32:26,572 --> 00:32:31,149
<i>I also read your other book,
Bottleneck.</i>

260
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,660
That was good.

261
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:45,174
I read it late at night,...

262
00:32:46,383 --> 00:32:48,383
all alone,...

263
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:50,385
in my bed.

264
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:54,349
I even colored pages.

265
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:04,232
Hi.

266
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:26,590
If I am good, I then
in your next book?

267
00:33:27,216 --> 00:33:29,216
Well, damn...

268
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:31,678
I can use a new muse.

269
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:53,392
Damn.

270
00:33:53,492 --> 00:33:56,245
I think I have a recurring
personnage your going to make.

271
00:34:07,422 --> 00:34:09,925
Sorry...
- Is there drool on my face?

272
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:13,178
Sorry...
I'm just...

273
00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:17,055
I'm nervous.

274
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:20,836
I thought...

275
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:22,936
You thought...

276
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:27,401
you never have such a good sex
would like Pablo Alesandro.

277
00:34:32,781 --> 00:34:36,118
How did you know?
- It is written on your face.

278
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:40,205
Do you know Pablo? Do you know where he is?

279
00:34:41,165 --> 00:34:43,370
He must have been mad,
he left you behind.

280
00:34:55,012 --> 00:34:56,413
Maybe I left him behind.

281
00:34:56,513 --> 00:35:01,059
Therefore the streets of your foam
Buenos Aires as a small dog...

282
00:35:03,145 --> 00:35:05,145
Get out.

283
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,856
This is an evil laugh.

284
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,780
Have you ever noticed that Pablo never laughs?

285
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:18,327
I've long thought that my
silly jokes lay.

286
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:23,790
And then I realized that Pablo
can not laugh...

287
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:27,169
just as dumb can not speak.

288
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:32,299
Yes. As he was when we were children.

289
00:35:34,426 --> 00:35:36,426
I can imagine.

290
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:38,929
Two angelic altar boys,...

291
00:35:39,681 --> 00:35:41,850
two Catholic schoolboys...

292
00:35:45,229 --> 00:35:47,229
walking around in the church...

293
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:50,317
and secretly under the habits of
The nuns crept...

294
00:35:50,651 --> 00:35:52,651
and a murder were committed with impunity...

295
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:56,698
And who played together in the
bell after mass.

296
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:01,159
Have you fucked him?

297
00:36:01,578 --> 00:36:04,581
Two and half years.

298
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:14,005
I think now it should go.

299
00:36:15,676 --> 00:36:19,179
How to tell the Americans that
again? 'Chill Out'?

300
00:36:19,805 --> 00:36:21,805
Have some fun with me anyway.

301
00:36:21,974 --> 00:36:25,435
It's just sex, man. Relax.

302
00:36:25,686 --> 00:36:28,162
Not anymore.
- Okay.

303
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:41,324
Pablo and I were faithful to each other.

304
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:45,829
Pablo Alesandro?

305
00:36:45,914 --> 00:36:49,175
He loves the bath.
Bath-house...

306
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:51,293
He was different with me.

307
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,670
Oh, yeah?

308
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:05,559
You know what? Pablo came back to
Argentina for me.

309
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:08,770
You were just a pleasure,
a little pleasure.

310
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:14,482
Fuck you, asshole.

311
00:38:20,676 --> 00:38:22,676
Did you enjoy it, Dean?

312
00:38:59,548 --> 00:39:01,548
Can I treat you in a glass?

313
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:03,285
I'm going home.

314
00:39:03,385 --> 00:39:07,723
Home? Is a nice girl like you
on a Saturday night home alone?

315
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:09,917
Come on, let's go have fun.

316
00:39:10,017 --> 00:39:12,019
I know a dirty gay tent...

317
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:15,812
A gay-tent?

318
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:18,481
Come on.

319
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:30,746
Why did you not fucking me
Marcos said that the former is Pablo?

320
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:41,089
I've learned to me interfering
between a boy and his...

321
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:46,301
Understand what I mean?

322
00:39:46,345 --> 00:39:50,682
I understand above all that much that you know
and you tell me.

323
00:39:52,935 --> 00:39:55,145
And I understand you better.

324
00:39:57,105 --> 00:39:59,105
What do you mean?

325
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:03,735
You do you want to cool.

326
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:10,077
As with that gun, today.

327
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:12,754
Then you felt a real man.

328
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,290
I thought that was nice.

329
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:24,466
And I thought your attack on that
Brazilian mamaracha fun.

330
00:40:26,635 --> 00:40:28,887
How do you rid yourself back...

331
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,558
like the characters in your comics.

332
00:40:34,852 --> 00:40:36,852
Graphic novels.

333
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:47,739
I want to go to the country house of Pablo.

334
00:40:48,866 --> 00:40:50,866
Take me to it.

335
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:02,794
I'll take you.

336
00:41:12,306 --> 00:41:14,306
I'll pay for gasoline.

337
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:21,688
I think this is fun.

338
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:26,303
I could easily live here
From here and work.

339
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:28,055
There is much that you do not understand.

340
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:30,282
I learn quickly, like a sponge.

341
00:41:30,449 --> 00:41:32,449
When I was little,...

342
00:41:32,534 --> 00:41:36,413
my nanny took me a bath every night.

343
00:41:36,955 --> 00:41:41,627
And on my 12th birthday I took for
the first time only one bath.

344
00:41:42,794 --> 00:41:44,794
And my mother...

345
00:41:45,547 --> 00:41:48,967
had invited her friends
a tea party in the bathroom...

346
00:41:50,594 --> 00:41:52,888
like a real show could be seen.

347
00:41:54,223 --> 00:41:58,936
And how shy I was
When I stepped out of the bath,...

348
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:01,855
they began to clap...

349
00:42:02,022 --> 00:42:04,650
and they feleciteerden me with my first bath.

350
00:42:04,817 --> 00:42:07,361
The whole country or if you just
a crazy mother?

351
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:14,785
It is the country.
We love tradition.

352
00:42:14,952 --> 00:42:18,747
We cling to the past
because the present is too difficult.

353
00:42:19,456 --> 00:42:21,456
And the future?

354
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:26,839
I refuse to continue my life coffees
Serve as a girl.

355
00:42:38,267 --> 00:42:40,461
I must warn you,
this can sometimes get out of hand.

356
00:42:40,561 --> 00:42:42,855
Pablo and I never do anything without fireworks.

357
00:42:43,021 --> 00:42:45,440
Pablo is not here;
This is my house.

358
00:42:47,651 --> 00:42:49,261
What?

359
00:42:49,361 --> 00:42:52,573
It is too far for tonight.
We are going tomorrow.

360
00:43:09,756 --> 00:43:10,949
Welcome to La Elsa.

361
00:43:11,049 --> 00:43:13,051
So you're in cahoots.

362
00:43:14,595 --> 00:43:16,595
What does "in cahoots"?

363
00:43:17,222 --> 00:43:19,472
It means that you offer
to have my balls.

364
00:43:19,558 --> 00:43:22,663
And it is also the name of the bar
where I first kissed a guy.

365
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:24,769
And look how far it has brought me.

366
00:43:25,063 --> 00:43:27,383
I knew you would not count
if I told you.

367
00:43:27,483 --> 00:43:29,483
Fuck you with him?

368
00:43:29,526 --> 00:43:32,321
Sorry to disappoint,
but she is my sister.

369
00:43:33,071 --> 00:43:35,071
As if that something belongs to you.

370
00:43:35,657 --> 00:43:37,059
Dean...

371
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:39,536
You must enjoy the outdoors in style.

372
00:43:39,703 --> 00:43:42,956
And this is one of the most traditional
country houses.

373
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:45,651
We were born here.

374
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:47,751
On the bench.

375
00:43:48,462 --> 00:43:50,114
Just kidding.

376
00:43:50,214 --> 00:43:52,214
Something to drink?

377
00:43:53,717 --> 00:43:55,717
Because I do.

378
00:44:00,891 --> 00:44:04,446
Hey, Marcos. Sofia wants to know if you
have enjoyed the cock of the piccolo.

379
00:44:06,563 --> 00:44:08,649
Sofia ball that can not care.

380
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:10,718
Sofia goes to sleep.

381
00:44:10,818 --> 00:44:12,818
I want a whiskey.

382
00:44:13,278 --> 00:44:15,278
Are you sure you want to drink anything?

383
00:44:21,954 --> 00:44:24,871
American whiskey?
- American whiskey.

384
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,691
You see, this is exactly what I mean.

385
00:44:50,899 --> 00:44:52,909
This is completely ridiculous.

386
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:56,479
I want to go back to my hotel,
to Guillermo and his lips...

387
00:44:56,646 --> 00:44:58,907
and my view of the Rio de la Plata.

388
00:45:00,075 --> 00:45:02,075
Have you no ejector seat or something?

389
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:04,119
What is that, "an ejection seat?

390
00:45:04,954 --> 00:45:06,954
Dean...

391
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,419
You know why Pablo has returned
to this country?

392
00:45:10,586 --> 00:45:13,130
He missed the heat down,...

393
00:45:13,297 --> 00:45:15,799
the kindness and honesty
of the Argentines.

394
00:45:15,966 --> 00:45:17,966
You're very arrogant, you know?

395
00:45:24,892 --> 00:45:26,892
Maybe he's right.

396
00:45:33,484 --> 00:45:35,484
Do it.

397
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:44,203
Does anyone have a toothbrush
I can borrow?

398
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,840
Thanks for the toothbrush.

399
00:46:01,678 --> 00:46:03,678
Anything else is needed?

400
00:46:04,932 --> 00:46:06,932
I can use a cigarette.

401
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:26,451
It was Pablo's 15th birthday.

402
00:46:29,331 --> 00:46:31,959
It seems like you fight
to his attention.

403
00:46:35,045 --> 00:46:37,045
That was a game between us.

404
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:41,802
But I was tired and so
Marcos, I win.

405
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:45,679
I know that game.

406
00:46:47,307 --> 00:46:49,518
Games for children.

407
00:47:06,368 --> 00:47:08,368
I thought this was my room?

408
00:47:10,581 --> 00:47:12,581
Yes, that's right.

409
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,295
But there's a ghost in the mine.

410
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:23,927
My mother always bought her sheets...

411
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:26,344
by nuns in Belgium.

412
00:47:27,264 --> 00:47:29,264
Blind nuns.

413
00:47:30,726 --> 00:47:32,853
She sewed everything by hand.

414
00:47:33,312 --> 00:47:35,312
Even though they were blind?

415
00:47:36,231 --> 00:47:38,609
They feel good against your skin...

416
00:47:41,945 --> 00:47:43,945
On our friendship.

417
00:47:58,629 --> 00:48:02,299
Your mother sounds... unique.

418
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:04,549
I'd like to meet her.

419
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:06,801
She's dead.

420
00:48:08,055 --> 00:48:10,265
She wanted me to become a priest.

421
00:48:11,016 --> 00:48:13,644
I thought about it, but...

422
00:48:14,228 --> 00:48:16,438
I think I love sex too much.

423
00:48:18,482 --> 00:48:20,482
Anyway, I...

424
00:48:21,068 --> 00:48:25,280
I feel guilty every time
when I cum on these sheets.

425
00:48:25,823 --> 00:48:29,409
I think the nuns in Belgium,...

426
00:48:29,785 --> 00:48:32,037
there are so...

427
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:40,587
all night long,
while the bells...

428
00:48:47,787 --> 00:48:49,787
Dean...

429
00:48:51,431 --> 00:48:53,431
Can I sleep tonight?

430
00:48:55,811 --> 00:48:59,022
I have a long days stalking
in prospect.

431
00:49:00,732 --> 00:49:02,732
Just to sleep.

432
00:49:02,901 --> 00:49:05,404
I do not want to be alone with the mind.

433
00:49:07,656 --> 00:49:09,656
You get used to it.

434
00:49:27,509 --> 00:49:29,509
Here I am.

435
00:49:29,928 --> 00:49:31,928
And I'm going nowhere.

436
00:49:35,058 --> 00:49:36,126
He seems bored.

437
00:49:36,226 --> 00:49:38,003
He is finished with you.

438
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:41,523
You were just a pleasure,
a little pleasure.

439
00:49:45,486 --> 00:49:47,486
Let me sleep, Jesus.

440
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,280
Happy birthday.

441
00:49:53,869 --> 00:49:55,869
Did you just move your eyes?

442
00:50:22,439 --> 00:50:27,690
Good morning.
- Good morning.

443
00:50:28,987 --> 00:50:30,987
Breakfast?

444
00:50:31,657 --> 00:50:33,657
I'd love to.

445
00:50:49,258 --> 00:50:51,844
Take me now to Pablo's house?

446
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:54,010
Marcos brings you after breakfast.

447
00:50:54,221 --> 00:50:56,221
I want to leave now.

448
00:50:56,223 --> 00:51:00,394
Quietly,
It is perhaps ten miles from here.

449
00:51:02,646 --> 00:51:07,233
So close?
Why did not you tell me yesterday?

450
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,654
Marcos did murder you tonight.

451
00:51:10,821 --> 00:51:13,341
He could not because he is a bit
love you.

452
00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:25,542
Okay, I bring you now.

453
00:51:32,342 --> 00:51:34,342
Thanks for breakfast.

454
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:36,761
You're welcome.

455
00:51:49,176 --> 00:51:51,176
Marcos, do you?

456
00:51:56,325 --> 00:51:58,325
It is so beautiful.

457
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:04,041
My great-grandfather, Felipe de Crespi,
bought this house.

458
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:06,708
We call it 'La Elsa.

459
00:52:07,169 --> 00:52:10,589
If things do not improve,
Sofia might be selling.

460
00:52:11,298 --> 00:52:13,298
Why 'La Elsa?

461
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,637
The official story is
that my great-grandfather...

462
00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:19,429
a granddaughter named Elsa.

463
00:52:19,765 --> 00:52:21,765
And the unofficial story?

464
00:52:21,934 --> 00:52:23,934
His wife,...

465
00:52:24,102 --> 00:52:26,688
My great-grandmother,
was very clean...

466
00:52:26,855 --> 00:52:28,855
and apparently, very cold.

467
00:52:29,274 --> 00:52:33,153
And Felipe found passion with another
woman named Elsa.

468
00:52:33,862 --> 00:52:37,616
Elsa was the love of his life.

469
00:52:37,908 --> 00:52:41,203
Unfortunately it was Elsa, which the kitchen.

470
00:52:42,371 --> 00:52:45,040
They had a relationship where none
something could learn from.

471
00:52:45,415 --> 00:52:47,415
Are we?
- Yes.

472
00:52:50,295 --> 00:52:51,947
Elsa became pregnant.

473
00:52:52,047 --> 00:52:55,509
Felipe and said she would give anything...

474
00:52:55,676 --> 00:52:59,137
unless he would take care of her and her baby.

475
00:52:59,721 --> 00:53:01,457
I thought it was close.

476
00:53:01,557 --> 00:53:03,557
I lied.

477
00:53:03,892 --> 00:53:05,892
How far yet?

478
00:53:06,478 --> 00:53:08,478
An hour maybe.

479
00:53:11,441 --> 00:53:13,918
Can you just stop?
Because I really need to pee urgently.

480
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:22,035
One night a loyal servant...

481
00:53:22,202 --> 00:53:24,632
Felipe and told him to
that the baby was coming.

482
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:28,000
Elsa Felipe hoped would melt...

483
00:53:29,084 --> 00:53:32,921
that he would protect her
and would remain with her forever.

484
00:53:34,423 --> 00:53:37,509
Felipe saw it differently, however.

485
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:40,846
He saw her as a snake...

486
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,974
that invaded his garden.

487
00:53:47,394 --> 00:53:49,730
While her baby was born,...

488
00:53:50,189 --> 00:53:52,816
Felipe came into her room...

489
00:53:54,234 --> 00:53:56,234
and...

490
00:54:01,617 --> 00:54:03,310
How exciting.

491
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:05,525
I would propose to you
to my publisher.

492
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,080
How does it end?

493
00:54:09,374 --> 00:54:11,151
Once the baby was born...

494
00:54:11,251 --> 00:54:13,962
Felipe grabbed his machete...

495
00:54:14,129 --> 00:54:16,590
Elsas and cut head.

496
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:21,094
And, do you like my country?

497
00:54:31,104 --> 00:54:33,982
Why he sent her
to a monastery or something?

498
00:54:34,149 --> 00:54:36,860
She had poor nuns help
those sheets.

499
00:54:37,027 --> 00:54:39,738
Because her silence would last forever.

500
00:54:41,198 --> 00:54:44,034
Poison would not have been easier?

501
00:54:49,456 --> 00:54:52,751
A snake is only dead if you chops off her head.

502
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,800
Here it is.

503
00:55:09,142 --> 00:55:10,627
But now when he is here.

504
00:55:10,727 --> 00:55:12,171
Or what?

505
00:55:12,271 --> 00:55:14,271
Come on.

506
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:17,190
When we were still in school...

507
00:55:17,192 --> 00:55:20,696
Pablo and I came here many times
may go...

508
00:55:21,405 --> 00:55:23,405
to be here to stay.

509
00:55:24,366 --> 00:55:27,035
This was our only chance in the same
bed to sleep.

510
00:55:27,202 --> 00:55:29,202
I want to show you something.

511
00:55:36,753 --> 00:55:39,840
That drives me crazy bastard.

512
00:55:47,139 --> 00:55:49,683
Yes, here it is.

513
00:55:50,809 --> 00:55:52,809
I knew it.

514
00:55:53,228 --> 00:55:56,690
Come look closer.
See that?

515
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,900
Semen stains.

516
00:56:02,821 --> 00:56:04,098
Not only me...

517
00:56:04,198 --> 00:56:06,198
and not just him.

518
00:56:06,533 --> 00:56:09,328
It was the combination that made us so strong.

519
00:56:09,745 --> 00:56:11,745
Not strong enough.

520
00:56:21,548 --> 00:56:23,659
You're afraid you never no man more
will find...

521
00:56:23,759 --> 00:56:27,134
that takes you to those places
you just do not dare to go.

522
00:56:27,221 --> 00:56:29,221
Right?

523
00:56:44,571 --> 00:56:47,032
Anyone can ejaculation from a tree.

524
00:56:47,783 --> 00:56:50,577
Pablo and I did it
in the house of P. Diddy.

525
00:56:50,744 --> 00:56:53,372
On a bed full of coats of famous stars.

526
00:56:53,956 --> 00:56:57,292
Madonna asks, still down from
where that smell comes from.

527
00:56:58,752 --> 00:57:00,752
Marcos?

528
00:57:03,507 --> 00:57:05,551
Pablo, honey?

529
00:57:06,885 --> 00:57:08,885
Honey, I'm home.

530
00:57:42,212 --> 00:57:44,212
Ritalin.

531
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:56,330
Dean...

532
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:59,938
You and I...
Pablo should we forget...

533
00:58:00,522 --> 00:58:02,522
we erase from his past...

534
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:06,361
if he wants to continue his life here.

535
00:58:12,993 --> 00:58:15,245
This is his bedroom.

536
00:58:18,415 --> 00:58:20,415
Here I was always happy.

537
00:58:26,131 --> 00:58:28,133
You knew that would not Pablo.

538
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:34,515
Closer than this will not help.

539
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,720
Damn.

540
01:01:10,754 --> 01:01:12,754
Marcos?

541
01:01:19,346 --> 01:01:21,390
Damn, man.

542
01:01:46,456 --> 01:01:50,669
You should absolutely see Pablo's house, huh?
You just would not give up.

543
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:10,020
Shall we call the police?

544
01:02:12,149 --> 01:02:13,801
They will arrest you.

545
01:02:13,901 --> 01:02:15,901
I did nothing.
- I believe you.

546
01:02:16,945 --> 01:02:19,656
You're not strong enough to do that.

547
01:02:21,492 --> 01:02:23,702
But the police will have a different view.

548
01:02:23,911 --> 01:02:25,437
You tell them the truth just yet.

549
01:02:25,537 --> 01:02:29,291
There is someone responsible for,
and we both know who that is.

550
01:02:32,377 --> 01:02:35,756
Then add something or go home.

551
01:04:29,203 --> 01:04:32,789
With a gun...
I will not really help you.

552
01:04:35,209 --> 01:04:37,234
I am not afraid to use it.

553
01:04:44,134 --> 01:04:46,428
Look at me, you, witch.

554
01:04:50,808 --> 01:04:52,976
You're scared.

555
01:04:53,477 --> 01:04:55,479
I can smell the stench.

556
01:04:56,355 --> 01:04:58,355
A dog can.

557
01:05:07,783 --> 01:05:11,203
My son does not make good choices.

558
01:05:27,386 --> 01:05:30,138
You can not touch this.

559
01:05:31,807 --> 01:05:33,807
Go home.

560
01:05:41,984 --> 01:05:43,984
Good luck.

561
01:06:59,812 --> 01:07:01,812
No movement.

562
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:43,270
Good dog...

563
01:07:56,952 --> 01:07:59,538
You do know this for a
night, huh?

564
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,960
You know what?

565
01:08:08,463 --> 01:08:10,841
I can still use you as a pillow.

566
01:08:16,221 --> 01:08:18,265
I have a stressful day behind.

567
01:09:24,456 --> 01:09:25,941
Who's here?

568
01:09:26,041 --> 01:09:27,526
What are you doing here?

569
01:09:27,626 --> 01:09:30,587
I live here.
What are you doing here?

570
01:09:32,422 --> 01:09:36,552
Do not worry about the title.
I take care of it.

571
01:09:58,532 --> 01:10:02,161
Stop now come with me to follow.
- I follow you not.

572
01:10:02,452 --> 01:10:05,164
You hung out accidental tourist
in the graveyard, huh?

573
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:07,330
No, I've slept.

574
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:10,752
Seriously. Pablo's mother...

575
01:10:10,919 --> 01:10:12,963
has driven a lot of men behind me.

576
01:10:16,925 --> 01:10:19,011
And yet you did not give up, huh?

577
01:10:19,386 --> 01:10:22,206
Because I have not received yet
which I have come here.

578
01:10:22,306 --> 01:10:26,143
I have 15 hours in a fucking stupid
plane sat.

579
01:10:26,393 --> 01:10:28,812
I'm not going home without a souvenir.

580
01:10:41,158 --> 01:10:43,202
What do you do?

581
01:10:43,785 --> 01:10:47,456
How could I miss?
Marcos told me the secret.

582
01:10:48,415 --> 01:10:49,483
What secret?

583
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:51,402
Felipe and kitchen helper.

584
01:10:51,502 --> 01:10:53,362
Who?

585
01:10:53,462 --> 01:10:55,114
I have to wake up.

586
01:10:55,214 --> 01:10:58,175
I have all the pieces in my head.

587
01:10:58,342 --> 01:11:00,928
I can not shake my head,
if I were drowning.

588
01:11:01,136 --> 01:11:04,056
Dean, dear, you should really go home.

589
01:11:04,223 --> 01:11:06,223
I have no house.

590
01:11:06,308 --> 01:11:09,019
You know what? I'm with that crap
Pablo over Sat

591
01:11:09,186 --> 01:11:11,647
As of today, Dean Seagrave...

592
01:11:11,814 --> 01:11:14,858
no crap pick Pablo Alesandro.

593
01:11:15,025 --> 01:11:17,275
I'm tired after that serpent
to sit.

594
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:21,907
But this is strange, Sofia.
Not that I have not thought of....

595
01:11:22,074 --> 01:11:24,576
It is a very satisfactory picture...

596
01:11:24,743 --> 01:11:27,704
yet also terrifying.

597
01:11:30,624 --> 01:11:34,294
A symbolic exorcism.
Handle that well?

598
01:11:34,503 --> 01:11:37,256
You do not even know where he is.
- Do you see?

599
01:11:37,422 --> 01:11:38,866
Sofia, all the pieces fall together.

600
01:11:38,966 --> 01:11:43,220
All my fantasies fucking result
in the act itself.

601
01:11:43,387 --> 01:11:47,766
Okay, maybe I had to
beach can go and do yoga.

602
01:11:47,933 --> 01:11:50,102
But damn.
I can not save Pablo.

603
01:11:50,269 --> 01:11:52,771
I'm not Jesus
or not a magician.

604
01:11:53,397 --> 01:11:56,727
I'm just a fag with a
pistol, a chainsaw needs.

605
01:11:59,903 --> 01:12:02,656
And there you have an Argentine
hardware store.

606
01:12:06,243 --> 01:12:08,243
What is a chainsaw?

607
01:12:10,038 --> 01:12:12,038
I'm looking for a chainsaw.

608
01:12:30,392 --> 01:12:32,211
What makes that noise.

609
01:12:32,311 --> 01:12:35,439
That's not useful. How can you
Now it surprise anyone?

610
01:12:37,774 --> 01:12:40,110
There are no silencers for
chainsaws?

611
01:12:41,236 --> 01:12:42,346
What are you looking for?

612
01:12:42,446 --> 01:12:46,783
What do you have anything of that size
by cutting?

613
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:49,853
And not electric, because I might
no socket is at hand.

614
01:12:49,953 --> 01:12:51,271
Dean, let's talk outside.

615
01:12:51,371 --> 01:12:53,371
Can you mach chanterelles?

616
01:13:04,676 --> 01:13:07,221
Felipe de Crespi used a machete.

617
01:13:07,554 --> 01:13:10,974
Felipe de Crespi?
My grandfather?

618
01:13:13,268 --> 01:13:15,268
She looks very sharp.

619
01:13:15,395 --> 01:13:17,395
These are quiet, huh?

620
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:22,860
Much more satisfactory,
much better for the bowels.

621
01:13:24,112 --> 01:13:26,406
A chainsaw, that's cheating, huh?

622
01:13:26,949 --> 01:13:28,949
Exactly.

623
01:13:29,076 --> 01:13:31,119
It should not be too easy.

624
01:13:31,328 --> 01:13:33,328
I would get a kick out of...

625
01:13:33,413 --> 01:13:35,413
vent my anger...

626
01:13:36,041 --> 01:13:38,041
expressing.

627
01:13:39,711 --> 01:13:42,047
This is a much better choice.

628
01:13:43,215 --> 01:13:45,215
I'll take this.

629
01:13:45,551 --> 01:13:47,551
You also have handcuffs?

630
01:13:49,388 --> 01:13:51,388
What about this?

631
01:13:52,558 --> 01:13:54,558
Perfect.

632
01:14:21,336 --> 01:14:23,072
I think my new machete great.

633
01:14:23,172 --> 01:14:25,841
I do not think I've long
can live without.

634
01:14:26,425 --> 01:14:28,425
I will bring you to your hotel?

635
01:14:28,552 --> 01:14:31,263
No, I just bought all that stuff.
I must find him.

636
01:14:33,073 --> 01:14:35,184
I have something else to do tonight.

637
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:38,061
Sorry, I thought we wanted the same.

638
01:14:40,230 --> 01:14:42,774
This place is all Pablo.

639
01:14:42,941 --> 01:14:45,861
I use my thumb though.
You keep the machete but with you.

640
01:14:46,028 --> 01:14:48,028
Please note well.

641
01:14:49,239 --> 01:14:51,239
Dean, wait.

642
01:15:05,923 --> 01:15:09,051
It's okay, he was not here.
Ride.

643
01:15:14,306 --> 01:15:16,306
Is it?

644
01:15:20,437 --> 01:15:22,689
Marcos got going here once followed.

645
01:15:28,111 --> 01:15:30,111
Who you talking to?

646
01:15:47,297 --> 01:15:48,949
What is that?

647
01:15:49,049 --> 01:15:52,136
A gift for all you
have done for me.

648
01:15:55,305 --> 01:15:57,683
I am tired of stupid, small
boys to apply...

649
01:15:57,783 --> 01:16:01,061
their courses if they have not
immediately get what they want.

650
01:16:01,895 --> 01:16:03,939
Pablo has started.

651
01:16:04,773 --> 01:16:08,067
It is very easy for you, huh?
I mean...

652
01:16:08,652 --> 01:16:11,029
You grab the plane and booked a hotel...

653
01:16:11,196 --> 01:16:13,223
and you use your credit card
a machete to buy...

654
01:16:13,323 --> 01:16:16,285
to cut off the head of
the boy who does not love you.

655
01:16:16,451 --> 01:16:18,579
But you know what?
Other people, like us,...

656
01:16:18,829 --> 01:16:22,166
living in the real world
with real problems. Okay?

657
01:16:29,464 --> 01:16:31,925
I can not do.
- Of course not.

658
01:16:34,052 --> 01:16:36,052
Queers can not kill.

659
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:38,430
Look at Marcos.

660
01:16:39,475 --> 01:16:43,479
It was easier for him to
bullet in his head to shoot...

661
01:16:43,645 --> 01:16:45,645
than yours.

662
01:16:46,023 --> 01:16:48,023
Even for Pablo.

663
01:16:55,782 --> 01:16:57,868
Pablo knows everything from here.

664
01:17:02,623 --> 01:17:04,623
That was him on the phone.

665
01:17:05,626 --> 01:17:07,836
I've told him about the machete.

666
01:17:08,837 --> 01:17:10,952
He is probably still
to laugh.

667
01:17:22,810 --> 01:17:24,810
Sit down.

668
01:17:37,157 --> 01:17:39,157
<i>Sofia?</i>

669
01:17:40,702 --> 01:17:43,622
Pablo, I agree.

670
01:17:47,376 --> 01:17:49,376
Where...

671
01:17:53,006 --> 01:17:55,133
Tell me where the hell he is...

672
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:58,804
if I use it again and now intentional.

673
01:18:03,684 --> 01:18:05,684
I'll take you with him.

674
01:18:07,271 --> 01:18:09,271
Tonight.

675
01:18:09,481 --> 01:18:11,481
Are you happy now?

676
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:21,852
With Louise.

677
01:18:21,952 --> 01:18:24,663
Louise?
It's Dean, Dean Seagrave.

678
01:18:25,164 --> 01:18:27,958
You're in the mountains?
I hear you bad.

679
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:31,295
I am in Argentina.

680
01:18:31,461 --> 01:18:33,155
<i>Jesus, Dean.</i>

681
01:18:33,255 --> 01:18:35,591
And what are your plans today?

682
01:18:36,717 --> 01:18:38,717
Do you ride your bike ride past his house?

683
01:18:39,386 --> 01:18:41,386
I wanted you just call me.

684
01:18:42,598 --> 01:18:44,598
Is there anyone at Jamba Juice?

685
01:18:44,725 --> 01:18:48,187
I would like a berry cocktail
with many proteins. Fast.

686
01:18:49,438 --> 01:18:50,714
<i>I'm here, Dean.</i>

687
01:18:50,814 --> 01:18:54,026
Louise, I have something for you.

688
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:56,303
Something I want to show.

689
01:18:56,403 --> 01:18:58,180
<i>Your custom script?</i>

690
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:01,492
No, no. Something new.

691
01:19:02,868 --> 01:19:05,662
I am been very creative.

692
01:19:10,292 --> 01:19:12,292
<i>Dean?</i>

693
01:19:14,505 --> 01:19:16,198
<i>It does not sound like yourself.</i>

694
01:19:16,298 --> 01:19:18,298
I come home, Louise.

695
01:19:18,592 --> 01:19:22,387
It starts tonight at 22h flight.
Tomorrow afternoon I'm in LA

696
01:19:22,805 --> 01:19:24,039
<i>Great.</i>

697
01:19:24,139 --> 01:19:26,391
I will shave my pussy.

698
01:19:27,491 --> 01:19:29,491
Day.

699
01:19:47,454 --> 01:19:49,454
Hi, do you speak English?

700
01:19:50,999 --> 01:19:53,085
There is soon a man down.

701
01:19:53,293 --> 01:19:55,462
His name is Pablo Alesandro.

702
01:19:55,629 --> 01:19:59,633
Pablo Alesandro?
That is around the corner, in the church.

703
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,844
He does so here.
- In the church? - Yes.

704
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:06,216
Sir, everyone is up.
- Thanks.

705
01:25:51,068 --> 01:25:53,068
Damn.

706
01:25:53,570 --> 01:25:55,570
You are deceiving me.

707
01:25:56,657 --> 01:25:58,657
You used that anyway.

708
01:26:07,751 --> 01:26:10,379
Tell him to wait on you next.

709
01:26:10,671 --> 01:26:12,671
Tell him if you will.

710
01:26:31,733 --> 01:26:34,403
Welcome to Argentina.

711
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:02,723
Do not be silly.
I've already called the police.

712
01:27:02,890 --> 01:27:05,626
You look fantastic, Sofia.
Good that you have chosen to ecru.

713
01:27:05,726 --> 01:27:08,103
And that cuts my breath away anorak.

714
01:27:08,437 --> 01:27:09,797
Well shame of your hand.

715
01:27:09,897 --> 01:27:12,483
Where are you going? Stop.

716
01:27:56,995 --> 01:27:59,947
Sofia. Come here.

717
01:28:02,157 --> 01:28:04,535
Have you seen those stupid Americans?

718
01:28:05,410 --> 01:28:07,410
No.

719
01:28:07,663 --> 01:28:09,706
And where is Pablo?

720
01:28:11,041 --> 01:28:13,252
He fucks one of the waiters.

721
01:28:31,728 --> 01:28:33,728
Your hands...

722
01:28:36,692 --> 01:28:38,692
Fuck her?

723
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:40,596
Who?

724
01:28:40,696 --> 01:28:42,473
Your wife.

725
01:28:42,573 --> 01:28:44,573
This marriage makes sense for us.

726
01:28:44,616 --> 01:28:47,411
Sofia has my money
and I want her surname.

727
01:28:47,578 --> 01:28:49,578
I want to be respected.

728
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:51,580
It is important to me.

729
01:28:56,044 --> 01:28:58,044
"Fuck your hair?" I asked you.

730
01:28:59,298 --> 01:29:01,633
It is a coventioneel marriage.

731
01:29:05,304 --> 01:29:08,307
It's so cute when you wrong
words.

732
01:29:10,017 --> 01:29:12,686
Move that stuff aside,
as in the road.

733
01:29:32,873 --> 01:29:34,873
What's in that cooler?

734
01:29:37,419 --> 01:29:39,419
Space.

735
01:29:39,797 --> 01:29:41,797
Dean...

736
01:29:43,467 --> 01:29:45,467
I wrote you a goodbye note.

737
01:29:46,804 --> 01:29:49,139
Dean, my hands are tied.

738
01:29:49,473 --> 01:29:51,473
Really...

739
01:29:53,936 --> 01:29:57,021
Tell me about Marcos.
- Marcos?

740
01:29:58,232 --> 01:30:00,526
How did it feel when you killed him?

741
01:30:00,776 --> 01:30:02,776
I did not murder him.

742
01:30:03,403 --> 01:30:08,325
Okay, how did it feel when you discovered that
He was dead by your fault?

743
01:30:10,077 --> 01:30:12,412
I was always honest with Marcos.

744
01:30:12,996 --> 01:30:14,440
But he was crazy.

745
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:18,043
He came to the gym and fell
tears to my feet...

746
01:30:18,377 --> 01:30:20,712
and he begged me to come back to him.

747
01:30:21,088 --> 01:30:24,133
It was grotesque,
I was ashamed of him.

748
01:30:28,011 --> 01:30:30,011
You loved it.

749
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:34,309
I'm not perfect,
but I am not a murderer.

750
01:30:38,355 --> 01:30:40,355
Did you miss me at all?

751
01:30:41,108 --> 01:30:42,801
I understand that you are angry.

752
01:30:42,901 --> 01:30:44,901
Angry?

753
01:30:44,945 --> 01:30:47,823
I came to South America and
You did not even talk to me.

754
01:30:48,907 --> 01:30:50,907
I am not a good person, Dean.

755
01:30:50,993 --> 01:30:54,371
I have many problems.
I'm addicted to sex.

756
01:30:55,497 --> 01:30:58,625
Really, I go to a support group.

757
01:30:58,792 --> 01:31:00,792
And since you got back down in one sentence.

758
01:31:00,794 --> 01:31:02,794
It's not your fault, Dean.

759
01:31:02,838 --> 01:31:06,049
It did not.
I was scared.

760
01:31:06,216 --> 01:31:08,385
I have intimacy problems.

761
01:31:08,635 --> 01:31:10,721
Pablo, shut up.

762
01:31:12,306 --> 01:31:14,516
What do you want more, huh?

763
01:31:20,105 --> 01:31:22,105
Dean, I know where you're going.

764
01:31:23,692 --> 01:31:25,692
Yeah, so?

765
01:31:26,445 --> 01:31:28,445
You forgot to save.

766
01:31:34,536 --> 01:31:37,539
Dean, Jesus, what are you doing?

767
01:31:39,166 --> 01:31:41,402
Pablo, we were not in this car
presided as you...

768
01:31:41,502 --> 01:31:43,712
What? Loved you?

769
01:31:57,893 --> 01:31:59,895
I know again what I wanted to ask you.

770
01:32:01,730 --> 01:32:03,730
Marcos had to murder me?

771
01:32:04,566 --> 01:32:06,566
Does that matter?

772
01:32:09,321 --> 01:32:11,321
Yes, that's what out.

773
01:32:11,698 --> 01:32:13,698
I do not like you, Dean.

774
01:32:13,784 --> 01:32:16,161
And I want your boyfriend are not.

775
01:32:16,787 --> 01:32:19,665
I am married, damn.

776
01:32:25,879 --> 01:32:27,879
I gotta pee.

777
01:33:20,142 --> 01:33:22,142
Flat on your stomach.

778
01:33:25,898 --> 01:33:28,609
Shall we just do?

779
01:33:30,319 --> 01:33:32,319
It's your party.

780
01:33:37,701 --> 01:33:40,078
You said you would love me,
what might happen.

781
01:33:40,954 --> 01:33:42,954
I lied.

782
01:33:43,957 --> 01:33:46,418
I'm ready to go, Dean. Come on.

783
01:33:47,586 --> 01:33:49,797
I wish we could go inside and...

784
01:33:51,089 --> 01:33:55,385
could take off all our clothes
and crawl into bed and...

785
01:33:56,637 --> 01:33:58,722
together in your bed too.

786
01:34:01,725 --> 01:34:04,353
I would rather wish than anything.

787
01:34:06,730 --> 01:34:09,774
I knew you were a coward.
A coward.

788
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:43,058
This is good touch, Dean.

789
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:52,510
<i>By comparison it seems that the Speed Freak...</i>

790
01:34:52,609 --> 01:34:55,237
<i>on a Christmas card for the Osmond family.</i>

791
01:34:55,863 --> 01:34:59,074
Something I have not three years
your received.

792
01:34:59,741 --> 01:35:01,741
What took you so long?

793
01:35:02,661 --> 01:35:05,164
Let's say I have found my voice.

794
01:35:06,206 --> 01:35:08,206
You should not smoke.

795
01:35:09,501 --> 01:35:11,501
Sorry.

796
01:35:12,254 --> 01:35:15,924
I love those red spots
you've used everywhere.

797
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:20,760
It is rude and loud and...

798
01:35:21,138 --> 01:35:23,265
I get a sense of to take a good puke.

799
01:35:25,684 --> 01:35:27,684
Great.

800
01:35:28,187 --> 01:35:30,189
Did I tell you that I have a dog?

801
01:35:31,482 --> 01:35:33,482
And your friend?

802
01:35:33,859 --> 01:35:35,859
Oh, that...

803
01:35:36,278 --> 01:35:40,115
We are currently separated, but...

804
01:35:41,408 --> 01:35:43,702
Who knows what happens there in the future?

805
01:35:46,455 --> 01:35:49,124
Well... gefeleciteerd.

806
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:54,071
Thanks, sweetie.

807
01:35:54,171 --> 01:35:57,049
Incidentally, there is a large parcel
before you arrived.

808
01:35:57,633 --> 01:36:02,003
It stands in front. Grab it with me
if you go outside, okay? - Thanks.

809
01:36:02,596 --> 01:36:06,506
I'll keep you posted.
- Okay, do that.

810
01:36:19,321 --> 01:36:21,365
<i>King, did you miss me?</i>

811
01:36:26,995 --> 01:36:29,164
No, this is not for you.

812
01:36:36,046 --> 01:36:38,046
Hello, sunshine.

813
01:36:40,592 --> 01:36:42,592
<i>She liked it, King.</i>

814
01:36:43,387 --> 01:36:45,931
She was my best work ever.

815
01:36:47,724 --> 01:36:50,352
I think that everything is now.

816
01:37:10,353 --> 01:37:12,353
