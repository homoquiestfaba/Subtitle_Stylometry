ENCOURAGED BLAKE

00:08:45,618 --> 00:08:48,988
THE MORE
 HE TEES YOU UP, LOVER.

178
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:51,211
HE KNOWS THAT.

179
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:53,991
HE KNOWS WHAT?

180
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,493
KIM...

181
00:08:56,527 --> 00:08:59,308
KNOWS
HE'S BUILDING ME UP.

182
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:03,164
OR SETTING ME UP...

183
00:09:04,588 --> 00:09:07,784
FOR GOD
ONLY KNOWS WHAT.

184
00:09:12,613 --> 00:09:16,713
Mennaker: BEAUTIFUL

185
00:09:16,749 --> 00:09:18,937
BEAUTIFUL...

186
00:09:18,971 --> 00:09:23,107
FATHERLESS
AMERICAN BOY.

187
00:09:34,398 --> 00:09:38,220
OH, I'M SO STONED

188
00:09:38,775 --> 00:09:39,713
AMY...

189
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:43,986
LEAVE OFF DEVOURING
THAT SPLENDID HEIRLOOM.

190
00:09:44,022 --> 00:09:48,538
LUCIUS, TAKE HER PLACE.

191
00:09:53,437 --> 00:09:54,965
NO! OH!

192
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,503
YOU'RE PUNISHING ME.

193
00:10:04,832 --> 00:10:07,335
Lucius:
MY BROTHER...

194
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:11,052
MUCH BETTER.

195
00:10:29,048 --> 00:10:31,967
Blake: TEACHERS NEED
TO BE BETTER PAID.

196
00:10:32,002 --> 00:10:32,905
WE NEED...

197
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,469
BETTER FACILITIES...

198
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:35,615
EDUCATION IS LIFE!

199
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:37,422
COUNT ON ME
TO BE THERE FOR YOU.

200
00:10:37,456 --> 00:10:38,603
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME.

201
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,680
COUNT ON IT!

202
00:10:39,714 --> 00:10:43,120
Mennaker: RISE AND SHINE,
MY BEAUTEOUS BILLY BOY.

203
00:10:43,155 --> 00:10:46,872
DON'T WATCH YOUR BROTHER
ON THAT BOX.

204
00:10:46,906 --> 00:10:49,720
HIGH TIME WE SAW HIM
IN PERSON.

205
00:10:49,755 --> 00:10:52,674
AND WON'T HE BE SURPRISED?

206
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,141
YOUR BROTHER SO NEEDS
TO BE SURPRISED.

207
00:10:55,175 --> 00:10:59,136
THIS IS CELA BRANDINI
REPORTING FOR ETC--

208
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:07,475
DEAR HEART...

209
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:09,767
ARE YOU READY TO GO?

210
00:11:11,365 --> 00:11:12,859
HMM?

211
00:11:18,037 --> 00:11:21,720
THAT'S MY BILLY BOY.

212
00:11:21,754 --> 00:11:23,005
[LAUGHTER]

213
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,464
Man: YOU KNOW, BLAKE,
THE WORD "DESPAIR"

214
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:27,139
CROPPED UP TWICE
IN YOUR SPEECH
TO THE TEACHERS.

215
00:11:27,174 --> 00:11:29,814
HOW MANY TIMES DID
THE WORD "THE" CROP UP?

216
00:11:29,848 --> 00:11:30,613
[LAUGHTER]

217
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:31,829
I BLAME MY SPEECHWRITER
FOR THAT.

218
00:11:31,864 --> 00:11:35,338
HE LOOKED VERY DEPRESSED
YESTERDAY.

219
00:11:35,547 --> 00:11:39,612
BUT SERIOUSLY,
PEOPLE DO DESPAIR
ABOUT GOVERNMENT

220
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,696
BECAUSE THERE'S
A WIDESPREAD BELIEF

221
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:43,156
THAT POWER CAN
ONLY BE BOUGHT NOW.

222
00:11:43,191 --> 00:11:46,039
BUT ISN'T THAT WHAT
YOU'RE DOING, BLAKE?
AREN'T YOU RICH?

223
00:11:46,075 --> 00:11:48,331
OH, YEAH,
BUT THAT'S LUCK,
YOU KNOW.

224
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:50,070
I MEAN, I MARRIED
MY COLLEGE SWEETHEART.

225
00:11:50,104 --> 00:11:52,501
SHE JUST HAPPENED
TO BE RICHER THAN GOD.

226
00:11:52,536 --> 00:11:53,370
[LAUGHTER]

227
00:11:53,405 --> 00:11:56,809
BUT I'M NOT--I'M NOT
HERE TO PROMOTE...

228
00:11:56,844 --> 00:11:57,852
DESPAIR.

229
00:11:57,886 --> 00:12:00,771
I'M NOT HERE TO PROTECT
GOVERNMENT BY THE RICH.

230
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:02,681
HOMER DIX
HAS BEEN HINTING

231
00:12:02,715 --> 00:12:05,008
THAT HE'S GOT
THE GOODS ON YOU.

232
00:12:05,044 --> 00:12:05,947
OH, IS THAT RIGHT?

233
00:12:05,982 --> 00:12:07,927
WELL, I'M GLAD
SOMEBODY DOES.

234
00:12:07,963 --> 00:12:09,387
[LAUGHTER]

235
00:12:09,421 --> 00:12:11,123
I CHOOSE NOT TO
BELIEVE IN HINTS.

236
00:12:11,158 --> 00:12:14,285
I PREFER
A RED-BLOODED RUMOR
ANYTIME.

237
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,378
THANK YOU.
OH, I'M AFRAID
I HAVE TO GO.

238
00:12:17,412 --> 00:12:18,524
YEAH. I'M LATE AS IT IS.

239
00:12:18,558 --> 00:12:20,538
Woman:
THANKS, BLAKE.

240
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:24,604
I'LL BUY YOU
AN ICE CREAM CONE LATER.

241
00:12:24,951 --> 00:12:29,086
WHO IS, UH,
"RAYMOND ROMERO?

242
00:12:29,121 --> 00:12:29,989
"RAY...

243
00:12:30,024 --> 00:12:32,178
RAYMOND ROMERO?"

244
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:34,888
YOU DO KNOW THE NAME.

245
00:12:35,513 --> 00:12:38,154
I KNOW LOTS OF NAMES.

246
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,038
EVEN YOURS, MS...

247
00:12:41,073 --> 00:12:43,053
I'M CELA BRANDINI.

248
00:12:43,087 --> 00:12:45,658
OH, YEAH. YOU'RE
THE CNN CORRESPONDENT

249
00:12:45,693 --> 00:12:48,925
THEY CALL
THE DESERT FOX.

250
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,807
I REMEMBER THAT
INTERVIEW YOU DID
WITH HUSSEIN

251
00:12:51,843 --> 00:12:52,954
DURING THE GULF WAR.

252
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,448
I'M NOW
REINVENTING MYSELF

253
00:12:54,484 --> 00:12:55,699
AS AN AMERICAN

254
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,333
FOR ENTERTAINMENT

255
00:12:57,367 --> 00:13:00,007
CNN TO ETC.
THAT'S TRADING DOWN.

256
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:01,050
DEPENDS ON
YOUR POINT OF VIEW.

257
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:04,525
I AM NOW FREE TO CREATE
AN ENTIRE NEWS DIVISION.

258
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,748
YOU CREATE THE NEWS,
WHILE I...

259
00:13:06,782 --> 00:13:09,388
PROVIDE
THE ENTERTAINMENT.
IS THAT THE DEAL?

260
00:13:09,423 --> 00:13:10,638
I'VE CONVINCED MY VIEWERS

261
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:11,924
THAT YOU'RE
THE NEXT PRESIDENT

262
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,800
OF THE UNITED STATES.

263
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:15,954
TELL THEM TO ELECT ME
GOVERNOR FIRST.

264
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,656
PERHAPS THEY WILL...

265
00:13:17,692 --> 00:13:19,220
IF YOU CAN TELL ME...

266
00:13:19,255 --> 00:13:21,722
WHO IS RAYMOND ROMERO?

267
00:13:22,104 --> 00:13:25,335
TELL THEM I'M
WONDERING MYSELF.

268
00:13:33,256 --> 00:13:36,418
WE MUST ALL BE CRAZY
GETTING UP THIS EARLY!

269
00:13:36,453 --> 00:13:39,823
GOOD MORNING.
HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

270
00:13:41,108 --> 00:13:43,020
[INDISTINCT]
WHAT?

271
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:44,131
OK.

272
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,806

MAKE SURE TO VOTE FOR ME.

275
00:13:59,244 --> 00:14:00,773
BILLY?

276
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,375
BILLY?

277
00:14:13,072 --> 00:14:17,103
Brandini:
WHO IS RAYMOND ROMERO?

278
00:14:17,137 --> 00:14:19,673
DON'T GO...
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

279
00:14:19,707 --> 00:14:20,368
DON'T LEAVE.

280
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:23,079
THE OLD MAN
WON'T LIKE THAT.

281
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:24,919
FUCK THE OLD MAN!

282
00:14:24,954 --> 00:14:27,282
[RATTLING]

283
00:14:45,245 --> 00:14:48,231
LOOK, YOU AND KINZEL
ARE NEVER TO LET BLAKE
OUT OF YOUR SIGHT.

284
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:50,178
REMEMBER THE RUCKUS
WITH THAT WOMAN
IN CAPE GIRARDEAU?

285
00:14:50,213 --> 00:14:52,749
BLAKE ASKED ME
TO GET HIM A DOUBLE
SHOT OF ESPRESSO.

286
00:14:52,783 --> 00:14:53,617
OH, WONDERFUL.

287
00:14:53,652 --> 00:14:55,702
I GOT HIM
A DOUBLE SHOT
OF ESPRESSO.

288
00:14:57,925 --> 00:14:59,176
SIR, YOUR ESPRESSO.

289
00:14:59,211 --> 00:15:00,288
IT'S COLD, SIR. I--

290
00:15:00,323 --> 00:15:01,816
BLAKE, WHERE
THE HELL DID YOU GO?

291
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:04,388
GARNE,
YOU SEE THIS
HOMELESS MAN?

292
00:15:04,423 --> 00:15:06,124
GIVE HIM
A COUPLE
OF BUCKS.

293
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,322
ISN'T IT A BIT
EARLY IN THE DAY
FOR LIBERAL GUILT?

294
00:15:09,356 --> 00:15:10,746
I'VE ONLY GOT 20s.

295
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,413
GIVE HIM ONE. OR 2.

296
00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:14,324
GUILT IS BEAUTIFUL,
BABY.

297
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:16,582
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

298
00:15:18,598 --> 00:15:21,620
I AM SOMEBODY ELSE.

299
00:15:22,976 --> 00:15:24,260
HELLO, BLAKE.

300
00:15:24,296 --> 00:15:26,206

IN FRONT OF 300 PEOPLE,

301
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,083
AND WHAT DID YOU DO?
YOU PLAYED HAMLET.

302
00:15:28,117 --> 00:15:31,001
GIVE ME A BREAK.
I DIDN'T EVEN
QUOTE HAMLET.

303
00:15:31,036 --> 00:15:32,425
YOU GOT UP THERE
LOOKING AND TALKING

304
00:15:32,461 --> 00:15:34,718
LIKE A MAN
WHO'D SEEN A GHOST!

305
00:15:34,753 --> 00:15:37,636
WHO
 IS RAYMOND ROMERO?

306
00:15:38,262 --> 00:15:39,790
HE'S A TRICK,

307
00:15:39,826 --> 00:15:41,077

KIM MENNAKER.

308
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,959
OH, GREAT! WELL, THEN,
HERE'S THE $60 BILLION
BONUS QUESTION--

309
00:15:43,995 --> 00:15:45,871
BLAKE, ARE YOU GAY?

310
00:15:46,218 --> 00:15:47,052
NOT THAT I CARE.

311
00:15:47,087 --> 00:15:48,859
BUT WHEN YOU GET UP
IN FRONT OF PEOPLE

312
00:15:48,894 --> 00:15:51,221
AND USE PHRASES LIKE
"WIDESPREAD DESPAIR"

313
00:15:51,256 --> 00:15:52,610
AND--AND "GOVERNMENT
OF THE RICH"

314
00:15:52,646 --> 00:15:55,321
AND BASICALLY SOW DOUBTS
ABOUT THE NATURE OF POWER
IN THIS COUNTRY,

315
00:15:55,356 --> 00:15:58,482
YOU SOUND LIKE
DR. KIM'S BUTT BUDDY!

316
00:15:58,517 --> 00:16:01,122
STOP.

317
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,250

YOU'RE FIRED, GARNE.

318
00:16:04,285 --> 00:16:05,431
WHAT, AGAIN?

319
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,488
WELL, THIS TIME,
FOR KEEPS.

320
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:09,670
YOU SPOKE
ABOUT THINGS

321
00:16:09,704 --> 00:16:11,823
THAT SHOULD
NEVER HAVE BEEN
TALKED ABOUT

322
00:16:11,859 --> 00:16:13,630
AND IN FRONT
OF KINZEL,
FOR GOD'S SAKE!

323
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,299
NO, KINZEL'S
YOUR SECURITY, DARLING.

328
00:16:26,242 --> 00:16:28,744
YEAH, BOUGHT AND
PAID FOR, I'M SURE.

329
00:16:35,622 --> 00:16:36,874
HERE'S YOUR...

330
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:39,237
YOUR SEVERANCE CHECK.

331
00:16:41,356 --> 00:16:43,960
OH, DI...

332
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:47,019

336
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,935

IS SHE GOOD-LOOKING?

340
00:17:27,564 --> 00:17:29,301
CALL IT AN ATTACK
OF MALE PRIDE.

341
00:17:29,336 --> 00:17:31,177
I JUST THINK IT IS
RIDICULOUS FOR ME

342
00:17:31,211 --> 00:17:33,470
TO BE WALKING AROUND
PENNILESS.

343
00:17:33,505 --> 00:17:35,589

KEEP TELLING THE WORLD

344

876
00:47:28,855 --> 00:47:29,654
AND SWITCH CLOTHES?

877
00:47:29,688 --> 00:47:31,286
I'M SUGGESTING
WE TURN OURSELVES IN.

878
00:47:31,321 --> 00:47:33,301
THE OLD MAN
WON'T LIKE THAT.

879
00:47:33,336 --> 00:47:37,019
FUCK THE OLD MAN!

880
00:47:40,876 --> 00:47:43,272
I HAD NO IDEA
UNTIL LAST WEEK

881
00:47:43,307 --> 00:47:46,678
THAT YOU AND DR. MENNAKER
ARE SO CLOSE.

882
00:47:46,712 --> 00:47:48,414
WHAT YOU'VE SEEN TONIGHT
IS JUST ME,

883
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:54,322
VACATIONING IN THE DARK HEART
OF A NOSTALGIC IMPULSE.

884
00:47:54,356 --> 00:47:55,989
I LIKE THAT.

885
00:47:56,024 --> 00:47:57,969
DARK HEART.

886
00:47:58,004 --> 00:48:00,435
IT SUITS YOU.

887
00:48:04,084 --> 00:48:05,057
YOU STILL SUFFER

888
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:08,740
OVER YOUR BROTHER KILLED
IN VIETNAM, DON'T YOU?

889
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,492
YOU DON'T JUST MOURN.

890
00:48:12,527 --> 00:48:18,190
YOU...SUFFER...DEEPLY.

891
00:48:21,525 --> 00:48:25,208
THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU
SO ATTRACTIVE TO ME.

892
00:48:25,973 --> 00:48:28,682
POLITICALLY, I MEAN.

893
00:48:32,817 --> 00:48:39,070
5 YEARS AGO,
I HELD IN MY ARMS
IN SARAJEVO...

894
00:48:39,313 --> 00:48:42,093
A DYING MAN.

895
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:48,485
THE ONLY--THE ONLY MAN
I EVER TRULY LOVED.

896
00:48:52,064 --> 00:48:56,267
I KNOW ABOUT SUFFERING,
DARK HEART.

897
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:08,741
YOU ARE
SEEKING ABSOLUTION
FOR SOME GREAT SIN.

898
00:49:08,775 --> 00:49:10,477
I ONLY WISH
I KNEW WHAT IT WAS.

899
00:49:10,513 --> 00:49:12,562
THAT'S BETWEEN
ME AND MY PRIEST.

900
00:49:12,597 --> 00:49:15,377
STAY AWAY FROM PRIESTS,
DARK HEART.

901
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:17,496
GO GET YOURSELF
A GOOD PSYCHIATRIST.

902
00:49:17,532 --> 00:49:21,561
I CAN'T AFFORD
A PSYCHIATRIST.

903
00:49:22,638 --> 00:49:24,445
POLITICALLY, I MEAN.

904
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,626
ANYWAY, HONEY,

905
00:49:25,661 --> 00:49:29,795
SHRINKS DON'T
BELIEVE IN SIN.

906
00:49:31,428 --> 00:49:33,860
THANKS FOR THE RIDE.

907
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:51,649
TOP OF THE MORNIN'
TO YOU, SIR.

908
00:49:51,683 --> 00:49:52,587
YOUR NECKLACE, SIR.

909
00:49:52,621 --> 00:49:56,061
KINZEL, TAKE THIS ANIMAL
TO A VETERINARIAN

910
00:49:56,096 --> 00:49:58,875
AND MAKE SURE
THAT IT'S SAFE.

911
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:00,265
STOP STARING AND DO IT.

912
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:03,913
AYE, AYE, SIR.

913
00:50:04,712 --> 00:50:08,568
I'M HERE AS A FRIEND.

914
00:50:08,603 --> 00:50:11,348
OK...

915
00:50:11,765 --> 00:50:12,391
HOW IS SHE?

916
00:50:12,425 --> 00:50:15,378
DO YOU
REALLY HAVE TO ASK?

917
00:50:15,413 --> 00:50:17,498
FINE.

918
00:50:17,533 --> 00:50:20,729
LISTEN, I WANT YOU
 TO REPLACE KINZEL.

919
00:50:20,763 --> 00:50:24,412
LOOKS LIKE
THE MAN IS DEVELOPING
TOO MUCH OF AN OPINION.

920
00:50:24,446 --> 00:50:26,601
GO TO YOUR WIFE.

921
00:50:26,635 --> 00:50:29,345
I WANT YOU
TO SEE A DOCTOR.

922
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,596
DON'T BE AN ASS.

923
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:33,063
GET UP.

924
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:37,058
OH!

925
00:50:37,092 --> 00:50:39,768
OH!

926
00:50:40,185 --> 00:50:43,728
I'M SORRY THAT
I STOLE YOUR DIAMONDS.

927
00:50:43,764 --> 00:50:46,647
MY DIAMONDS?!

928
00:50:46,682 --> 00:50:50,191
YOU TOOK MY DIAMONDS?

929
00:50:50,226 --> 00:50:54,429
YOU TOOK MY YOUTH,
BLAKE.

930
00:50:55,299 --> 00:50:56,098
[CRYING]

931
00:50:56,131 --> 00:50:59,710
YOU TOOK MY YOUTH.

932
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:09,335
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU
AND THAT COCKSUCKER?!

933
00:51:09,369 --> 00:51:11,802
AFTER 25 YEARS
OF MARRIAGE,

934
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:15,553
AFTER ALL
THE FUCKING CONCUBINES
AND THOSE WHORES,

935
00:51:15,588 --> 00:51:20,521
HE'S GONNA BE THE ONE
TO RIDE ALL OVER US,

936
00:51:20,556 --> 00:51:23,717
JUST LIKE HE DID YOUR
MOTHER AND YOUR FATHER.

937
00:51:23,753 --> 00:51:27,574
THERE'S MORE BAD NEWS.

938
00:51:28,373 --> 00:51:30,006
YOU BETTER BRACE YOURSELF.

939
00:51:30,041 --> 00:51:31,361
OH, WHAT IS IT?

940
00:51:31,395 --> 00:51:35,322
I'M BEGINNING TO THINK
THAT'S MY FUCKING NAME,
"BRACE YOURSELF."

941
00:51:35,357 --> 00:51:37,373
WELL, BRACE
YOURSELF!

942
00:51:37,407 --> 00:51:40,846
YOU KNOW THAT MAN LIVES
TO DESTROY YOU, BLAKE,

943
00:51:40,881 --> 00:51:43,939
AND HE ALWAYS HAS.

944
00:51:48,698 --> 00:51:52,693
HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN FREE OF HIM?

945
00:51:52,728 --> 00:51:55,960
EVER, HMM?
 EVERY BAD THING,

946
00:51:55,994 --> 00:51:59,746
EVERY SHAMEFUL THING
IN YOUR LIFE,

947
00:51:59,781 --> 00:52:03,394
HE'S BEEN
THE ARCHITECT.

948
00:52:03,881 --> 00:52:07,667
YOU ARE NOT
THE GUILTY ONE.

949
00:52:14,895 --> 00:52:16,458
NO.

950
00:52:17,708 --> 00:52:19,446
NO.

951
00:52:20,905 --> 00:52:22,851
NO.

952
00:52:23,371 --> 00:52:26,846
WE EITHER ARE...

953
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:27,923
OR WE ARE NOT.

954
00:52:27,957 --> 00:52:31,258
FOR A WOMAN WITH AN UNTOLD
PORTION OF VODKA IN HER,

955
00:52:31,293 --> 00:52:33,691
YOU ARE PRETTY DAMN LUCID.

956
00:52:33,725 --> 00:52:38,902
WINNING THIS ELECTION'S
ALL I GOT.

957
00:52:40,014 --> 00:52:43,906
IT'S THE ONLY THING...

958
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:49,811
THE ONLY THING
I CAN FEEL.

959
00:52:50,436 --> 00:52:53,877
THE ONLY THING
I CAN FEEL.

960
00:52:53,911 --> 00:52:54,884
YOU SHOULD
HAVE LISTENED

961
00:52:54,918 --> 00:52:56,691
TO YOUR FATHER
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO.

962
00:52:56,725 --> 00:52:58,497
HE SAW THROUGH ME.

963
00:52:59,436 --> 00:53:01,242
HE SAW GREATNESS IN YOU.

964
00:53:01,276 --> 00:53:03,709
HE SAW CASH IN ME.

965
00:53:03,743 --> 00:53:06,558
THAT I'D BE A GOOD KING
ON THE CHESSBOARD

966
00:53:06,592 --> 00:53:08,816
FOR HIS LITTLE QUEEN.

967
00:53:09,684 --> 00:53:11,143
HE WAS YOUR KIM.

968
00:53:11,178 --> 00:53:13,090
DON'T...

969
00:53:13,124 --> 00:53:16,807
DON'T COMPARE THEM.

970
00:53:17,883 --> 00:53:22,157
DADDY UNDERSTOOD LOVE
AS MUCH AS ANY MAN.

971
00:53:22,192 --> 00:53:25,111
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I TOLD HIM
I DIDN'T THINK

972
00:53:25,145 --> 00:53:29,558
I COULD EVER
COUNT ON YOU
WANTING CHILDREN,

973
00:53:29,593 --> 00:53:31,954
YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID?

974
00:53:31,989 --> 00:53:35,880
"YOU'LL BE OK, PUMPKIN.

975
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:38,312
BLAKE LOVES YOU."

976
00:53:42,448 --> 00:53:45,643
"HE LOVES YOU."

977
00:53:48,353 --> 00:53:51,654
HE SAW THAT IN YOU.

978
00:54:03,987 --> 00:54:08,053
I DON'T THINK THAT REMORSE
IS SOMETHING THAT, UH...

979
00:54:08,087 --> 00:54:13,716
THAT IS EXPRESSED
IN FRONT OF MILLIONS
OF PEOPLE SPONTANEOUSLY.

980
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:14,793
Kinzel:
REPLACE KINZEL.

981
00:54:14,827 --> 00:54:18,440
HE LOOKS LIKE A MAN
WHO'S DEVELOPING
AN OPINION.

982
00:54:18,476 --> 00:54:20,838
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT,
YOU SMOOTH BASTARD.

983
00:54:20,873 --> 00:54:24,034
BIG FRIEND
OF THE WORKING MAN,
THAT'S YOU.

984
00:54:24,069 --> 00:54:28,099
SHAKE THEIR HAND
AND HAND 'EM
A PINK SLIP.

985
00:54:28,135 --> 00:54:32,928
SLIP IT TO 'EM LIKE
A GODDAMN KNIFE.

986
00:54:34,353 --> 00:54:36,751
YEAH, LET'S HEAR IT
FOR REDEMPTION,
BLAKE.

987
00:54:36,786 --> 00:54:39,669
LET SOMEONE ELSE
GO OFF AND FIGHT
YOUR GODDAMN WARS,

988
00:54:39,703 --> 00:54:42,795
THEN MAYBE THE
CORPSE WILL SIT UP
AND FORGIVE YOU.

989
00:54:42,831 --> 00:54:45,019
THAT THE IDEA?

990
00:54:47,243 --> 00:54:49,953
YOU WANT
FORGIVENESS?

991
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:54,712
I'LL GIVE YOU
FORGIVENESS,
NUMBNUTS.

992
00:55:25,773 --> 00:55:30,290
A HIDDEN BROTHER IS
CASTING A PECULIAR SHADOW
OVER THE GOVERNOR'S RACE.

993
00:55:30,325 --> 00:55:31,610
CORPORAL RAYMOND ROMERO,

994
00:55:31,645 --> 00:55:33,695
MISSING IN VIETNAM
SINCE 1973,

995
00:55:33,729 --> 00:55:37,968
IS APPARENTLY BLAKE PELLARIN'S
LONG-LOST BIOLOGICAL BROTHER.

996
00:55:38,003 --> 00:55:39,461
TODAY RIVAL CANDIDATE
HOMER DIX

997
00:55:39,497 --> 00:55:43,318
IS ACCUSING PELLARIN
OF TREATING THIS FORGOTTEN
HERO LIKE A DIRTY SECRET.

998
00:55:43,353 --> 00:55:45,820
I'M GONNA HOLD
A PRESS CONFERENCE
TONIGHT AT 6:00

999
00:55:45,855 --> 00:55:48,634
AT WHICH TIME
I WILL REVEAL
TO THE VOTING PUBLIC

1000
00:55:48,669 --> 00:55:49,954
SOME NEW LIGHT
TO BE SHED

1001
00:55:49,989 --> 00:55:52,108
ON THE CHARACTER
OF BLAKE PELLARIN,

1002
00:55:52,143 --> 00:55:54,331
A MAN SO FAR
WHO HAS SHOWN
LITTLE RESPECT

1003
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:58,500
FOR THAT UNKNOWN
SOLDIER AND HIS
GREAT SACRIFICE.

1004
00:55:58,536 --> 00:56:00,863
REACTION FROM
THE PELLARIN CAMP WAS SWIFT.

1005
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,009
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO EXPECT
FROM MR. DIX.

1006
00:56:02,045 --> 00:56:04,025
I, TOO, WOULD
LIKE TO KNOW WHAT
HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

1007
00:56:04,059 --> 00:56:05,311
AND AS REGARDS
MY BROTHER,

1008
00:56:05,346 --> 00:56:06,978
I GAVE A LENGTHY
INTERVIEW

1009
00:56:07,012 --> 00:56:08,889
JUST RECENTLY
TO CELA BRANDINI...

1010
00:56:08,924 --> 00:56:10,001
Thad: THERE'S
A NEWS FLASH.

1011
00:56:10,035 --> 00:56:10,835
I WANTED
TO TELL YOU,

1012
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:11,704
BUT YOU'D ALREADY
LEFT FOR NEW YORK.

1013
00:56:11,738 --> 00:56:14,553
YOU THINK DIX HAS
CAUGHT HIM IN A LIE?

1014
00:56:14,587 --> 00:56:15,559
NO.

1015
00:56:15,594 --> 00:56:16,672
PELLARIN'S TOO CLEVER
TO BE TRAPPED THAT WAY.

1016
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:18,896
HE ONLY TELLS
PRECISELY THAT
FRACTION OF THE TRUTH

1017
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:22,855
WHICH WILL ALLOW THE
LISTENER'S IMAGINATION
TO LIE FOR HIM. NO.

1018
00:56:22,891 --> 00:56:25,010
THERE'S A MUCH
DEEPER ANGLE HERE.

1019
00:56:25,045 --> 00:56:27,894
A SEXY ANGLE?

1020
00:56:28,241 --> 00:56:30,117
SEXY IN THE SENSE
OF SEX,

1021
00:56:30,152 --> 00:56:33,452
OR SEXY IN THE SENSE
OF NEWS THAT SELLS?

1022
00:56:33,487 --> 00:56:34,216
I'LL BITE
AT EITHER END.

1023
00:56:34,252 --> 00:56:35,086
PELLARIN'S ONCE
COMMANDING LEAD

1024
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,483
HAS NOW DROPPED
TO LESS THAN 5 POINTS.

1025
00:56:37,518 --> 00:56:39,498
FUCK. WE'RE DEAD.
I'M FUCKING DEAD.

1026
00:56:39,532 --> 00:56:41,304
NOT JUST YET.

1027
00:56:41,339 --> 00:56:43,458
DO YOU REMEMBER
A COMPROMISING PHOTO

1028
00:56:43,493 --> 00:56:46,586
OF HOMER DIX WITH
HIS GOOD OL' BOYS?

1029
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:49,746
WE KEPT IT IN
A BLACK FILE FOLDER

1030
00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:51,485
LABELED
"HOMER'S ODYSSEY."

1031
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:52,527
I KNOW, I KNOW.

1032
00:56:52,561 --> 00:56:55,376
A THING
OF CROOKED BEAUTY,
BUT IT'S NOT HOMER.

1033
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:57,911
I FOUND THE REAL GUY
DOWN ON THE BOOT HEEL.

1034
00:56:57,947 --> 00:56:58,745
I TALKED TO HIM.

1035
00:56:58,781 --> 00:57:00,621
LOOKS JUST LIKE HOMER.
IS NOT HOMER.

1036
00:57:00,656 --> 00:57:01,664
THAT'S WHERE
YOU COME IN.

1037
00:57:01,699 --> 00:57:03,540
I WANT YOU
TO DOCTOR IT.

1038
00:57:03,574 --> 00:57:04,409
JUST A LITTLE.

1039
00:57:04,443 --> 00:57:07,153
ALL THAT
FANCY SOFTWARE
WE BOUGHT YOU.

1040
00:57:07,188 --> 00:57:11,288
YOU KNOW HOW HOMER
HAS THESE ODD
LITTLE SCARS

1041
00:57:11,322 --> 00:57:13,928
ACROSS 3 FINGERS
ON HIS HANDS?

1042
00:57:13,964 --> 00:57:15,596
I'VE NEVER LOOKED
AT HIS HANDS, BLAKE.

1043
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:17,229
NORMAL GUYS LOOK
AT EACH OTHER'S CARS.

1044
00:57:17,264 --> 00:57:19,105
ARE YOU ON THE BUS
OR OFF THE BUS?

1045
00:57:19,139 --> 00:57:23,170
"FURTHER" IS MY
DESTINATION, BABY.

1046
00:57:25,532 --> 00:57:28,208
I KNEW BOTH BROTHERS
IN SCHOOL.

1047
00:57:28,243 --> 00:57:31,438
RAY PUT HIMSELF UNDER
A LOT OF PRESSURE.

1048
00:57:31,474 --> 00:57:34,253
HE HAD A HUGE RAGE
TO SUCCEED.

1049
00:57:34,287 --> 00:57:36,581
HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND.

1050
00:57:36,616 --> 00:57:38,110
WE WERE ALWAYS
IN A CONTEST

1051
00:57:38,144 --> 00:57:41,653
TO SEE WHO COULD
HEAD UP THE MOST
AFTER-SCHOOL CLUBS.

1052
00:57:41,688 --> 00:57:43,285
HEH HEH.

1053
00:57:43,912 --> 00:57:46,691
BUT BILLY
I HARDLY KNEW.

1054
00:57:46,726 --> 00:57:48,811
NOBODY KNEW HIM.

1055
00:57:49,471 --> 00:57:50,547
IT'S AMAZING
HOW HE TURNED OUT

1056
00:57:50,582 --> 00:57:52,006
CONSIDERING HE WAS
ALWAYS IN TROUBLE.

1057
00:57:52,041 --> 00:57:53,292
AND DON'T USE THAT
IN YOUR PIECE.

1058
00:57:53,326 --> 00:57:56,419
DON'T WORRY.
THIS IS FOR
BACKGROUND.

1059
00:57:56,453 --> 00:57:58,434
BUT THE CANDIDATE
HIMSELF
IS VERY FRANK

1060
00:57:58,469 --> 00:58:00,622
ABOUT HIS SO-CALLED
TROUBLED PAST.

1061
00:58:00,658 --> 00:58:04,445
RAY GREW TO
HATE HIS GUTS.

1062
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,460
HOW SO?

1063
00:58:07,259 --> 00:58:08,266
WELL, BILLY--

1064
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:11,323
I COULD NEVER
GET USED TO
CALLING HIM BLAKE--

1065
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:14,381
BILLY WAS A HUGE SOURCE
OF EMBARRASSMENT TO RAY.

1066
00:58:14,416 --> 00:58:17,439
YOU'D FIND HIM
SLEEPING OUTDOORS...

1067
00:58:17,474 --> 00:58:19,558
CURLED UP
IN THE AUDITORIUM.

1068
00:58:19,593 --> 00:58:21,920
HIS FEET
WERE ALWAYS FILTHY.

1069
00:58:21,954 --> 00:58:23,867
HE HARDLY EVER WORE SHOES.

1070
00:58:23,901 --> 00:58:26,785
HE'D DISAPPEAR
FOR MONTHS AT A TIME

1071
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:30,815
AND THEN SHOW UP
OUT OF THE BLUE.

1072
00:58:32,829 --> 00:58:33,664
AND?

1073
00:58:33,698 --> 00:58:37,763
AND...SOMETHING
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SEEN.

1074
00:58:37,798 --> 00:58:39,361
TELL ME WHAT YOU SAW.

1075
00:58:39,396 --> 00:58:40,820
RAY WAS A GREAT GUY.

1076
00:58:40,856 --> 00:58:44,608
I WOULD HATE IF THIS WERE
THE ONLY IMPRESSION
THAT PEOPLE HAD OF HIM.

1077
00:58:44,643 --> 00:58:46,831
TELL ME WHAT YOU SAW.

1078
00:58:49,854 --> 00:58:53,120
IT WAS LIKE SOMETHING
OUT OF A NIGHTMARE.

1079
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:54,961
I'VE SEEN FIGHTS.

1080
00:58:54,996 --> 00:58:56,803
I'VE BEEN IN FIGHTS.

1081
00:58:56,837 --> 00:58:58,644
BUT THIS IS THE CLOSEST
I'VE EVER COME

1082
00:58:58,679 --> 00:59:02,258
TO WITNESSING
AN ATTEMPTED MURDER.

1083
00:59:06,113 --> 00:59:11,220
BUT I CAN TELL YOU,
BILLY DIDN'T DESERVE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

1084
00:59:15,529 --> 00:59:16,988
OK.

1085
00:59:17,023 --> 00:59:18,552
THANK YOU.

1086
00:59:18,586 --> 00:59:20,567
WHEN WAS
THE LAST TIME
YOU TALKED TO BLAKE?

1087
00:59:20,601 --> 00:59:24,075
OH, GOD...
YEARS AND YEARS.

1088
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:27,828
I THINK THE LAST TIME
THAT I SPOKE TO RAY

1089
00:59:27,863 --> 00:59:29,913
WAS WHEN HIS NUMBER
CAME UP.

1090
00:59:29,947 --> 00:59:31,163
NUMBER?

1091

1095
00:59:42,803 --> 00:59:44,922
IS THAT STANDARD
PRACTICE IN AMERICA?

1096
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:46,207
Rusty: BACK IN
THE FIFTIES IT WAS.

1097
00:59:46,242 --> 00:59:50,759
RUSTY, HOW DID
THE DRAFT LOTTERY WORK
DURING THE VIETNAM WAR?

1098
00:59:50,793 --> 00:59:53,921
WELL, THE NUMBERS WERE
BASED ON BIRTHDAYS.

1099
00:59:53,955 --> 00:59:56,387
SEE, THESE 2 GUYS
WERE BORN IN THE FIFTIES.

1100
00:59:56,421 --> 01:00:00,486
ROMERO, RAYMOND,
BORN 31 OCTOBER, 1953.

1101

THEY PICKED
THIS POOR BASTARD'S
BIRTHDAY AT NUMBER 10.

1102

PRESTO--6 MONTHS LATER
HE'S CARRYING AN M-16
WITH HIS ASS IN THE GRASS.

1103
01:00:07,608 --> 01:00:08,929
BUT HE WAS
STILL A STUDENT.

1104
01:00:08,965 --> 01:00:09,937
NO STUDENT DEFERMENTS.

1105
01:00:09,971 --> 01:00:13,307
THAT WAS NIXON'S REVENGE
ON STUDENT PROTESTERS.

1106
01:00:13,341 --> 01:00:15,739
NOW, PELLARIN, WILLIAM B...

1107
01:00:15,774 --> 01:00:18,519
HIS NUMBER WAS 305.

1108
01:00:18,553 --> 01:00:19,422
MADE IN THE SHADE.

1109
01:00:19,456 --> 01:00:22,445
BUT IF IT HADN'T BEEN,
WHAT COULD HE DO?

1110
01:00:22,479 --> 01:00:25,605
SHORT OF
WEARING LIPSTICK
AND HIGH HEELS,

1111
01:00:25,641 --> 01:00:27,518
HE COULD
GO TO CANADA...

1112
01:00:27,551 --> 01:00:28,524
HE COULD GO TO JAIL,

1113
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,887
OR HE COULD
TRY TO CONVINCE
THE DRAFT BOARD

1114
01:00:30,921 --> 01:00:31,617
HIS
BIRTH CERTIFICATE

1115
01:00:31,651 --> 01:00:33,979
IS A BASE AND
SLANDEROUS LIE.

1116
01:00:34,013 --> 01:00:36,064
WHAT DID
YOU
 DO?

1117
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:38,009
MY NUMBER WAS 219.

1118
01:00:38,044 --> 01:00:39,885
THE LUCKIEST
NUMBER OF MY LIFE.

ONTO SOMETHING.

WON'T LIKE THAT.

1133

1134
01:01:14,906 --> 01:01:16,851
OK.

1135
01:01:17,374 --> 01:01:19,388
IT'S BEEN TRIED.

1137
01:01:23,106 --> 01:01:25,086
YOU KNOW HOW HE IS.
YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S LIKE.

1138
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:26,789
DOESN'T MEAN
I'M A HOMOSEXUAL.

1139
01:01:26,823 --> 01:01:31,409
JUST MEANS I'M INTO
EXPERIMENTING, THAT'S ALL.

1140
01:01:34,188 --> 01:01:36,169
YOU WERE WRONG
TO SAY YES TO THIS.

1141
01:01:36,203 --> 01:01:37,524
I MADE A PROMISE.
SEMPER FI.

THE ARMY, NOT THE
GODDAMN MARINES.

1145

BUT EVEN SO,
I PROMISED YOU--
I PROMISED YOU,

1146
01:01:49,718 --> 01:01:50,970
AND I PROMISED
THE OLD MAN.

1147
01:01:51,005 --> 01:01:53,124
IT'S A CRAZY PROMISE.

01:06:01,572 --> 01:06:03,066
YES!

1212
01:06:10,535 --> 01:06:12,447
HELLO, KIM.

1213
01:06:12,481 --> 01:06:15,365
I'M HERE
AS A FRIEND.

1214
01:06:19,186 --> 01:06:22,765
HEY, Y'ALL NEED
TO BE ANNOUNCED.

1215
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:23,808
MR. DIX!

1216
01:06:23,842 --> 01:06:27,491
YOU BARGE IN HERE
WHILE I'M TAKING
MY EXERCISE?

1217
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:31,520
YOU'RE ON THE
9 A.M. NEWS SAYING
IT'S ALL OVER.

1218
01:06:31,555 --> 01:06:32,770
SOUNDS LIKE
A BAIT TO ME.

1219
01:06:32,806 --> 01:06:35,377
HEH. WELL, YOU MIGHT
AS WELL CONCEDE, SON.

1220
01:06:35,411 --> 01:06:38,678
THE FABLED FAT LADY
IS GETTING READY TO SING.

1221
01:06:38,712 --> 01:06:41,631
WE'VE GOT
THE GOODS ON YOU.

1222
01:06:41,665 --> 01:06:42,742
YEAH.

1223
01:06:42,777 --> 01:06:43,924
WELL, WELL, WELL.

1224
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:50,212
NOW, WOULD THESE BE
THE TRUE GOODS
OR THE FALSE GOODS?

1225
01:06:51,567 --> 01:06:52,506
HEH.

1226
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:53,721
WHAT WOULD, UH,

1227
01:06:53,756 --> 01:06:56,327
WHAT WOULD CONSTITUTE
THE FALSE GOODS
IN THIS SITUATION?

1228
01:06:56,361 --> 01:06:57,821
UH-UH-UH.
THAT WOULDN'T
BE CRICKET.

1229
01:06:57,855 --> 01:06:59,801
FOOTBALL, BLAKE.
FOOTBALL.

1230
01:06:59,836 --> 01:07:00,913
THAT'D BE OUT
OF BOUNDS, HOMER.

1231
01:07:00,948 --> 01:07:05,082
WHAT IN THE HELL'S HE,
YOUR DAMN
SPORTS CONSULTANT?

1232
01:07:05,117 --> 01:07:06,193
GOD DAMN IT.

1233
01:07:06,228 --> 01:07:09,182
CHIGGER,
GRAB THE DAMN SCOOP
AND RESCUE THAT THING.

1234
01:07:09,216 --> 01:07:10,989
IT ISN'T ME, HOMER.

1235
01:07:11,023 --> 01:07:12,934
THE PICTURE IN THERE,
IT ISN'T ME.

1236
01:07:12,969 --> 01:07:15,783
WELL, IT SURE AS HELL
LOOKS LIKE YOU.

1237
01:07:15,818 --> 01:07:19,117
SOMETIME TODAY,
YOU KNOW,
BEFORE CHRISTMAS.

1238
01:07:19,153 --> 01:07:20,300
I'VE SEEN IT ALREADY.

1239
01:07:20,334 --> 01:07:21,307
WHEN DID THAT GET HERE?

1240
01:07:21,342 --> 01:07:23,913
WAS THAT BROUGHT HERE
BY A PRETTY CREOLE MAID?

1241
01:07:23,948 --> 01:07:28,464
WHAT KINDA GAME
YOU PLAYIN' WITH ME?

1242
01:07:28,498 --> 01:07:30,618
WHAT GAME
ARE YOU PLAYING?

1243
01:07:30,653 --> 01:07:32,667
SAME AS YOU.
A GAME OF WORDS.

1244
01:07:32,703 --> 01:07:35,690
YES,
BUT I'VE FINISHED
MY BOOK, SENATOR.

1245
01:07:35,726 --> 01:07:37,254
WHY DON'T YOU
FINISH YOURS?

1246
01:07:37,289 --> 01:07:39,859
BECAUSE THE TRUTH
I AM SEEKING

1247
01:07:39,895 --> 01:07:42,918
WOULD DEFEAT
THE COMPLETION
OF ANY BOOK.

1248
01:07:42,952 --> 01:07:44,307
PERHAPS
WHAT YOU'RE SEEKING

1249
01:07:44,342 --> 01:07:46,635
IS A TOTAL EXCUSE
FOR HOW YOU THREW
YOUR LIFE AWAY.

1250
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:50,214
OHO. CONDEMNED BY
MY OWN BIOGRAPHER.

1251
01:07:50,248 --> 01:07:51,707
I HAVE LED A FULL LIFE.

1252
01:07:51,743 --> 01:07:54,591
YOU SWITCHED THEIR
BIRTH RECORDS,
DIDN'T YOU?

1253
01:07:54,626 --> 01:07:57,752
SEDUCING THE
WEAKER BROTHER...

1254
01:07:57,788 --> 01:08:01,644
TO SACRIFICE HIMSELF
FOR THE STRONGER.

1255
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:06,194
WHO'S TO SAY
WHICH WAS THE
STRONGER BROTHER?

1256
01:08:11,824 --> 01:08:14,707
HE'S STILL ALIVE,
ISN'T HE?

1257
01:08:17,452 --> 01:08:19,676
DEFINE "ALIVE."

1258
01:08:22,663 --> 01:08:24,261
DOES BLAKE KNOW?

1259
01:08:24,296 --> 01:08:27,180
WHEN YOU GET A BIT
OLDER, MY DEAR,

1260
01:08:27,215 --> 01:08:28,743
YOU'LL KNOW THAT
LIVING PEOPLE

1261
01:08:28,779 --> 01:08:31,106
ARE MUCH MORE FUN
TO READ THAN BOOKS,

1262
01:08:31,141 --> 01:08:37,637
AND MORE
STIMULATING TO PLAY
THAN TIDDLYWINKS.

1263
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:42,883
WHAT'S THIS?

1264
01:08:42,919 --> 01:08:45,768
IT'S NOT YOU.

1265
01:08:45,802 --> 01:08:48,061
IF I WAS YOU,
I WOULDN'T EVEN
LOOK AT IT.

1266
01:08:48,095 --> 01:08:53,724
I WOULD JUST CHUCK
THAT THING INTO THE POOL.

1267
01:09:04,425 --> 01:09:08,072
OH, GOD DAMN IT,
THAT IS NOT ME!

1268
01:09:08,108 --> 01:09:09,637
HOMER,
THAT IS NOT YOU.

1269
01:09:09,671 --> 01:09:11,721
I AM SERIOUS.
THAT IS NOT ME.

1270
01:09:11,756 --> 01:09:14,674
GOD DAMN, IT DOESN'T
LOOK ANYTHING LIKE HIM.

1271
01:09:14,708 --> 01:09:15,890
I KNOW
THAT IS NOT YOU.

1272
01:09:15,925 --> 01:09:18,426
I WILL TESTIFY IN COURT
 THAT IS NOT YOU.

1273
01:09:18,461 --> 01:09:19,433
YOUR HONOR,

1274
01:09:19,469 --> 01:09:22,318
THAT IS NOT THIS MAN.

1275
01:09:22,352 --> 01:09:24,748
THOSE KKK TATTOOS
ON HIS FINGERS

1276
01:09:24,784 --> 01:09:29,404
I HAVE ON GOOD
AUTHORITY FROM MY
SPORTS CONSULTANT,

1277
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:30,482
THEY ARE
NOT EVEN REAL.

1278
01:09:30,516 --> 01:09:33,713
THEY ARE COOKED UP
ON SOME SCOUNDREL'S
COMPUTER,

1279
01:09:33,748 --> 01:09:42,399
ALL TO TAKE THE MEANEST
POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR
MYSTERIOUS AFFLICTION.

1280
01:09:44,066 --> 01:09:46,117
WHAT PRECISELY
IS YOUR POINT?

1281
01:09:46,150 --> 01:09:48,618
ONLY THAT IN
THE GREAT SUPER BOWL

1282
01:09:48,653 --> 01:09:51,119
BETWEEN PERCEPTION
AND REALITY,

1283
01:09:51,154 --> 01:09:53,412
PERCEPTION HAS JUST
MARCHED THE BALL

1284
01:09:53,447 --> 01:09:57,720
60 YARDS DOWNFIELD
INTO REALITY'S END ZONE.

1285
01:09:57,755 --> 01:09:58,902
THAT'S THE GOAL,
RIGHT?

1286
01:09:58,937 --> 01:10:00,743
YES, BLAKE.
THE END ZONE
IS THE GOAL.

1287
01:10:00,778 --> 01:10:02,967
SEE, I COULD SWEAR
UP AND DOWN

1288
01:10:03,002 --> 01:10:04,842
THAT THIS PICTURE
IS A FAKE,

1289
01:10:04,877 --> 01:10:08,421
BUT THE QUESTIONS
ABOUT YOUR PAST

1290
01:10:08,456 --> 01:10:12,452
WILL BECOME AS REAL
AS THESE LITTLE SCARS.

1291
01:10:12,487 --> 01:10:19,330
YOU WILL SUDDENLY
BECOME A MAN ABOUT WHOM
THERE IS SOME QUESTION.

1292
01:10:19,366 --> 01:10:22,353
COULD YOU...

1293
01:10:22,389 --> 01:10:24,542
BORROW
A GODDAMN SWIMSUIT?

1294
01:10:24,577 --> 01:10:26,558
WHEN PEOPLE SEE
WHAT'S IN THAT ENVELOPE,

1295
01:10:26,592 --> 01:10:29,753
THEY'RE GONNA THINK
THEY'VE SEEN YOU BUMPING
DICK HEADS WITH A N--

1296
01:10:29,788 --> 01:10:32,567
GENTLEMAN
OF THE AFRICAN PERSUASION.

1297
01:10:32,602 --> 01:10:33,540
HA HA HA.

1298
01:10:33,576 --> 01:10:35,590
IT ISN'T ME, HOMER.

1299
01:10:35,625 --> 01:10:37,119
YOU PUSH ME
TO IT TONIGHT,

1300
01:10:37,153 --> 01:10:38,127
I'LL PROVE
IT ISN'T ME

1301
01:10:38,162 --> 01:10:40,628
IF I HAVE TO TAKE
A PISS IN PUBLIC
TO DO IT.

1302
01:10:40,662 --> 01:10:43,859
IF FOLKS WANT TO
THINK I'M A FAGGOT,
LET 'EM.

1303
01:10:43,895 --> 01:10:45,874
AS LONG AS IT
DOESN'T COST ME ANY
VOTES, I DON'T CARE.

1304
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:49,974
YEAH, WELL, PEOPLE
WILL ALWAYS CHOOSE
A BIGOT OVER A FAGGOT.

1305
01:10:50,009 --> 01:10:51,086
STUDY YOUR HISTORY.

1306
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:54,908
PEOPLE WILL VOTE
FOR THE PERSON
WHO IS LEAST AFRAID.

1307
01:10:54,942 --> 01:10:58,174
I'M NOT AFRAID
OF WHAT'S IN
THAT PHOTO, HOMER.

1308
01:10:58,209 --> 01:11:03,384
AS A PRACTICAL MAN,
PLAIN AS
A TREE STUMP,

1309
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:06,720
THAT SHOULD
CONCERN YOU.

1310
01:11:08,006 --> 01:11:10,750
DO YOU PLAN
TO DESTROY BLAKE?

1311
01:11:10,785 --> 01:11:12,626
YES...

1312
01:11:12,661 --> 01:11:13,565
IF I MUST...

1313
01:11:13,599 --> 01:11:15,858
IF HE'LL NOT
BE UNDERSTOOD
ANY OTHER WAY.

1314
01:11:15,892 --> 01:11:21,070
IF YOU CAN FIND
ANYTHING NICE TO
SAY ABOUT BLAKE,

1315
01:11:21,104 --> 01:11:25,377
DO PLEASE
GET IN TOUCH.

1316
01:11:25,412 --> 01:11:26,629
"STRATFORD
MOTOR HOTEL."

1317
01:11:26,663 --> 01:11:30,692
WHAT HAPPENED TO
 THE
LOUIS QUATORZE?

1318
01:11:30,728 --> 01:11:31,978
OH, NO, NO.
FORGET THE STRATFORD.

1319
01:11:32,013 --> 01:11:34,480
THAT'S JUST
WHERE I BUY MY CIGARS.

1320
01:11:34,515 --> 01:11:36,911
NO. YOU'LL FIND
MY HOME NUMBER INSIDE.

1321
01:11:36,946 --> 01:11:42,332
HOW IS IT YOU MOST WISH
TO BE REGARDED IN
POSTERITY, SENATOR?

1322
01:11:42,367 --> 01:11:45,806
IT'S WHAT WE DO HERE
AND NOW THAT MATTERS.

1323
01:11:45,841 --> 01:11:51,574
YOU DON'T
THINK POSTERITY
IS JUDGMENT, DO YOU?

1324
01:11:51,608 --> 01:11:54,493
POSTERITY IS A WHIM...

1325
01:11:54,527 --> 01:11:57,758
A SHAPELESS LITTER
OF OLD BONES...

1326
01:11:57,792 --> 01:11:59,600
THE MIDDEN
OF A VULGAR BEAST...

1327
01:11:59,634 --> 01:12:06,165
THE MOST CAPRICIOUS
AND IMMENSE MASS PUBLIC
OF THEM ALL--

1328
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,320
THE DEAD.

1329
01:12:08,354 --> 01:12:11,273
ADIOS, BRANDINI.

1330
01:12:20,237 --> 01:12:24,337
[THINKING]
SO THIS IS HOW
MY DEATH BEGINS--

1331
01:12:24,371 --> 01:12:26,804
AS A RUMOR.

1332
01:12:26,837 --> 01:12:30,763
SOME TRUE BELIEVER
WISHES ME DEAD.

1333
01:12:30,799 --> 01:12:32,258
WHAT NEXT...

1334
01:12:32,293 --> 01:12:33,335
POSTERITY?

1335
01:12:33,369 --> 01:12:38,477
BUT I'VE SPIT ON POSTERITY
FOR NEARLY HALF MY LIFE.

1336
01:12:38,511 --> 01:12:40,214
AND WHY?

1337
01:12:40,249 --> 01:12:43,897
BECAUSE I REGARD MYSELF
AS A FAILURE,

1338
01:12:43,931 --> 01:12:48,830
AND I DON'T WANT TO STUDY
WHAT THAT IS.

1339
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:53,555
COUNT ON ME
TO BE THERE FOR YOU.

1340
01:12:53,590 --> 01:12:54,564
COUNT ON IT!

1341
01:12:54,598 --> 01:12:57,168
[APPLAUSE]

1342
01:13:23,365 --> 01:13:26,596
Newscaster: THE LAST
FEW DAYS IN MISSOURI'S
INDEPENDENT GOVERNOR'S RACE

1343
01:13:26,631 --> 01:13:29,167
HAVE BEEN MORE DIFFICULT
TO PREDICT THAN USUAL.

1344
01:13:29,201 --> 01:13:31,773
POLLSTERS WHO GIVE THEMSELVES
A 5-POINT MARGIN FOR ERROR

1345
01:13:31,808 --> 01:13:36,219
NOW SAY THE RACE
IS TOO CLOSE TO CALL.

1346
01:13:57,655 --> 01:13:58,594
SORRY I'M LATE.

1347
01:13:58,629 --> 01:14:00,714
I WAS DODGING
REPORTERS.

1348
01:14:00,748 --> 01:14:01,999
SO WHAT
HAVE YOU GOT HERE?

1349
01:14:02,034 --> 01:14:04,743
GOT SOME MORE
BAGGAGE FOR US,
BLAKE?

1350
01:14:04,779 --> 01:14:05,612
IT'S $2 MILLION.

1351
01:14:05,647 --> 01:14:08,288
ENOUGH TO MAKE KIM
GO AWAY. DISAPPEAR.

1352
01:14:08,322 --> 01:14:11,033
YEAH. WELL,
HE NEEDS TO
DISAPPEAR VERY FAST.

1353
01:14:11,068 --> 01:14:15,897
WE ARE UP TO
OUR EYEBALLS
IN SUCH SHIT, BLAKE.

1354
01:14:15,931 --> 01:14:17,633
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

1355
01:14:17,668 --> 01:14:18,328
2 MORE DAYS.

1356
01:14:18,363 --> 01:14:22,636
AND THEN WHAT?
AND WHAT FOR?

1357
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:25,208
REALLY. WHAT FOR?

1358
01:14:25,243 --> 01:14:27,014
WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS
WANTED, NATURALLY.

1359
01:14:27,049 --> 01:14:29,134
THE BIG BRASS RING.

1360
01:14:29,168 --> 01:14:30,662
DO I DISTURB?

1361
01:14:30,697 --> 01:14:32,504
THIS IS A PRIVATE CLUB.

1362
01:14:32,539 --> 01:14:34,761
I FORGOT TO
TELL YOU, PUMPKIN--

1363
01:14:34,796 --> 01:14:37,784
SHE WANTED
AN INTERVIEW.

1364
01:14:37,819 --> 01:14:39,973
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

1365
01:14:41,642 --> 01:14:44,003
I TALKED TO YOUR
OLD SCHOOL FRIEND--

1366
01:14:44,038 --> 01:14:45,497
MAXIE--PACXY.

1367
01:14:45,532 --> 01:14:47,617
YOU TALKED TO PACXY.

1368
01:14:47,651 --> 01:14:48,868
PACXY BARRAGAN.

1369
01:14:48,902 --> 01:14:49,805
IT'S BEEN YEARS.

1370
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,682
HE SAYS HE SAW
ONE BROTHER
BEAT THE OTHER

1371
01:14:51,717 --> 01:14:55,990
NEARLY TO DEATH
VERY EARLY
ONE MORNING.

1372
01:15:01,514 --> 01:15:03,808
WELL, I MEAN, UH...

1373
01:15:05,371 --> 01:15:08,358
I MEAN, I REMEMBER
THE INCIDENT.

1374
01:15:08,393 --> 01:15:11,902
I'M JUST AMAZED
THAT ANYBODY SAW IT.

1375
01:15:11,936 --> 01:15:14,195
