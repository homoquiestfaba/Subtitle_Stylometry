to do with the Holocaust.

You elect your leaders.

146
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,679
You put them in power.

147
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,029
ELI: What does that
have to do with anything?

148
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,509
AHMAD: You sent tank shells
into my neighborhood.

149
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,635
DAPHNA:
That was not us.

150
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:58,460
AHMAD: My two daughters
were at home, studying for school.

151
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,480
Amira was six.

152
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,831
AHMAD:
Kayla was seven.

153
00:09:14,427 --> 00:09:15,443
AHMAD: I had to pick...

154
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,650
pieces of their bodies

155
00:09:18,674 --> 00:09:20,822
and put them in garbage bags.

156
00:09:26,124 --> 00:09:27,434
AHMAD: Two days later,

157
00:09:27,435 --> 00:09:31,563
I found my wife in a bathtub
soaking in her own blood.

158
00:09:37,352 --> 00:09:39,554
AHMAD: So you tell me exactly

159
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:42,880
what did I do to deserve this?

160
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,361
ELI: You and your terrorists
have been murdering people for decades.

161
00:09:51,385 --> 00:09:52,709
AHMAD: So has your government.

162
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,249
Speaker 3:
We are not our government.

163
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,459
But now I see
our government was right.

164
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,959
AHMAD: Oh you see?
You think Palestinians deserve this?

165
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,986
ELI: Israelis don't
strap bombs to their bodies

166
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,279
and go blow up innocent people.

167
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,929
AHMAD: You do it from
a distance just like cowards.

168
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,830
ELI: You are a barbarian.
We had nothing to do--

169
00:10:06,831 --> 00:10:08,181
AHMAD: You are just
as guilty as your leaders.

170
00:10:10,482 --> 00:10:13,166

If there is a hell,
