1
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,600
It's getting cold.

2
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,300
That is one fine frame.

3
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,500
One fine frame that is.

4
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,600
- How much...

5
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,200
does a fine frame like that
cost, do you think?

6
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I never told you, but you sound a little
like Dr. Seuss when you're drunk.

7
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,600
I know.
I'm serious.

8
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,500
Serious, I am.

9
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,400
I'd say it cost at least
a couple hundred.

10
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,000
- I'm gonna read it for you.
- Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?

11
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,200
"In recognition of his
outstanding achievement...

12
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,900
- " in the field of child psychology,
- Mm-hmm.

13
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,900
his dedication to his work
and his continuing efforts to
improve the quality of life-- "

14
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,500
- Will you concentrate?

15
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,800
"...his continuing efforts to
improve the quality of life...

16
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,800
"for countless children
and their families,

17
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,800
"the city of Philadelphia
proudly bestows upon its son...

18
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,700
Dr. Malcolm Crowe--"
That's you--

19
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,600
"...the Mayor's Citation
for professional excellence."

20
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,500
They called you their son.

21
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,300
Wow.

22
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,800
We should hang it
in the bathroom.

23
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,500
This is an important
night for us.

24
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,300
Finally, someone is recognizing
the sacrifices you've made--

25
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,900
that you have put everything
second, including me,

26
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,100
for those families that
they're talking about.

27
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,900
They're also saying that
my husband has a gift.

28
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
You have a gift
that teaches children...

29
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,100
- how to be strong in situations...

30
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,000
where most adults
would piss on themselves.

31
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,700
I believe
what they wrote is real.

32
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Thank you.

33
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,300
- I would like some wine in a glass.
- Mm- hmm.

34
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,400
I would not like it
in a mug.

35
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,000
- I would not like it in a jug.

36
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Look.

37
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,700
Anna, don't move.
Don't make a sound.

38
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,300
This is 47 Locus Street.

39
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,100
You've broken a window
and entered a private residence.

40
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,900
You don't know so many things.

41
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:00,700
There are no needles or prescription
drugs of any kind in this house.

42
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,700
Do you know why you're afraid
when you're alone?

43
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,800
I do.
I do.

44
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,200
What do you want?

45
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,000
What he promised me!
I want what he promised me.

46
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,500
- Oh, my God.
- Do I know you?

47
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,200
Don't you know me, hero?

48
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,300
Don't you even remember
your own patients?

49
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,600
Downtown clinic.

50
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,100
Single- parent family.

51
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,400
Possible mood disorder.

52
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,000
I was afraid!

53
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,700
You told me I was having trouble
coping with my parents' divorce.

54
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,500
You were wrong.
You were wrong.

55
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,700
Now look at me!

56
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,300
- I don't want to be afraid no more.
- Just give me a minute to think.

57
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,500
I waited
ten years for you!

58
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
I'm not giving you nothing!

59
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,300
Ben Friedkin?

60
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,700
Some people,
they call me "freak."

61
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,000
Ryan Summer?

62
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,100
I am. I am a freak.
Look at--

63
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,300
Vincent.

64
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,300
Vincent Gray.

65
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,300
No, you don't.

66
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,800
I do remember you.

67
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,500
Quiet, very smart.

68
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,400
Compassionate.

69
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,600
Unusually compassionate.

70
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,900
You forgot cursed.

71
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,900
You failed me.

72
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,800
You failed me!

73
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,300
Vincent, I'm sorry if I wasn't--
if I didn't help you.

74
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,200
But if you just let me try,

75
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,400
if you just
give me a chance--

76
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,200
Oh, God! Oh, God!

77
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,200
- Did Vincent--
- Don't talk. Shh.

78
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,900
It's okay, Cole.

79
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,700
My name is Dr. Malcolm Crowe.

80
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,300
We were supposed to meet today,
but I missed our appointment.

81
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,200
I'm sorry.

82
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:23,100
You know, in the olden days in Europe,
people used to hide out in churches.

83
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,400
They would claim sanctuary.

84
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,400
What were they hiding from?

85
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,400
Bad people, mostly.

86
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,900
People that wanted to
put them in jail, hurt them.

87
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,300
I noticed your eyeglasses.
They don't have any lenses in them.

88
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,600
They're my dad's.

89
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,000
The lenses hurt my eyes.

90
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,100
What were you talking about with your
soldiers when I came in? Day--

91
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,000
Deprofundus clamo
adite domine.

92
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,000
It's called " Latin."

93
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,100
- All your soldiers speak Latin?
- No.

94
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,000
Just one.

95
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,400
Are you a good doctor?

96
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,100
Well,

97
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,000
I used to be.

98
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,300
I won an award once
from the mayor.

99
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,800
It had an expensive frame.

100
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm gonna see you again,
right?

101
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,700
If that's okay with you.

102
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,500
It's me.

103
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,500
The turnpike westbound
slows at Valley Forge 24.

104
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,800
On the Blue Ridge,
both directions generally slow
between number three and two--

105
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
Hey, good morning.

106
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,200
Cole.

107
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,600
Cole!

108
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,200
Hey, your Cocoa Puffs
are gettin' soggy.

109
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,600
Let me see you.
Oh, honey, you got a spot.

110
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,500
Head up.

111
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,400
- Okay, here we go.

112
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,700
Something you were
looking for, baby?

113
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,500
Pop Tarts?

114
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,500
They're right here.

115
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,900
Oh.

116
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,300
Well, what are you
thinking, Mama?

117
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,500
Lots of things.

118
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,700
Anything bad about me?

119
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,800
Hey, look at my face.

120
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,500
I was not thinking
something bad about you.

121
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,600
Got it?

122
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,800
Got it.

123
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,300
- Here, head up.

124
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,600
- That's Tommy.
- That's okay. You tuck it in.

125
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,100
Cole, you want this?

126
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,900
Hey, freak, how'd you like that
"arm around the shoulder" bit?

127
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,600
I just made that up.
I went with it.

128
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,200
It's what great actors do.
It's called "improv."

129
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,400
Hey, baby.

130
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
How was your day?

131
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,700
Hmm?

132
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,200
You know, you can tell me things
If you need to.

133
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,800
Well, you know
what I did today?

134
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:54,000
I, uh, I won the Pennsylvania Lottery
in the morning,

135
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I quit my jobs,

136
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,100
and I ate a big picnic in the park
with lots of chocolate mousse pie.

137
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,500
And then I swam
in the fountain all afternoon.

138
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,400
What'd you do?

139
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,400
I was picked first for
kick ball teams at recess.

140
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,400
I hit a grand slam
to win the game.

141
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,400
Everybody lifted me up
on their shoulders
and carried me around, cheering.

142
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,400
Well, in that case, I am gonna
make you some triangle pancakes.

143
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,400
You got an hour.

144
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
Hi.

145
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,800
Wanna sit?

146
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,600
Don't feel like
talking today?

147
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,400
Wanna play a game?

148
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,400
It's a mind- reading game.

149
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,500
Here's how it works.

150
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,000
I read your mind.

151
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,400
If what I say is right, you take
one step towards the chair.

152
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,400
If what I say is wrong,
you take one step back...

153
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500
towards the doorway.

154
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,100
If you reach the chair,
you sit down.

155
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:25,000
If you reach the door,
you can go.

156
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,500
Wanna play?

157
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,700
Okay.

158
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,800
When your mother and father
were first divorced,

159
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,200
your mom went to see a doctor
like me, and he didn't help her.

160
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,300
So you think I'm not going
to be able to help you.

161
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,100
You're worried that she said
she told him things--

162
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,400
things she couldn't tell
anyone else.

163
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,700
Secrets.

164
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,200
You have a secret,
but you don't want to tell me.

165
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,500
Your dad gave you that watch
as a present just before he went away.

166
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,900
He forgot it in a drawer.

167
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,900
Doesn't work.

168
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,400
You keep pretty quiet
in school, but...

169
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,200
you're a good student, you've never
really been in any serious trouble.

170
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,600
We were supposed
to draw a picture.

171
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,700
Anything we wanted.

172
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,700
I drew a man.

173
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,700
He got hurt in the neck by
another man with a screwdriver.

174
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,100
You saw that on TV, Cole?

175
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,000
Everyone got upset.

176
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,000
They had a meeting.

177
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Mom started crying.

178
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,500
I don't draw
like that anymore.

179
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,700
How do you draw now?

180
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,400
I draw... people smiling,

181
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,400
dogs running,

182
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,800
rainbows.

183
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,100
They don't have meetings
about rainbows.

184
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,500
No. I guess they don't.

185
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,000
What am I thinking now?

186
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,600
I don't know
what you're thinking now.

187
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,800
I was thinking...

188
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,800
you're nice,

189
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,300
but you can't help me.

190
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,500
I thought you meant the other Italian
restaurant I asked you to marry me in.

191
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,600
I'm so sorry, Anna.

192
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,600
I just can't seem
to keep track of time.

193
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,300
And I didn't have
a very good session today.

194
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,700
They're both so similar.

195
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,000
The same mannerisms, same expressions,
same things hanging over their head.

196
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,000
I think it might be
some kind of abuse.

197
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,500
Cole has...
scratches on his arm.

198
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,200
I think they might be
fingernail cuts.

199
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,600
Defensive cuts, maybe.
I don't know.

200
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,600
Maybe a teacher or a neighbor.

201
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,400
I don't think it's the mother.
I've seen her with him,
and it doesn't seem to fit.

202
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,800
Or I could just be wrong.

203
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,900
Maybe he's just a kid
who likes to climb trees a lot.

204
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,500
Anna.

205
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,900
I know that I've been
a little distant, all right?

206
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,200
I know that it makes you mad.
I just...

207
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,200
feel like I'm being given
a second chance, and
I don't want it to slip away.

208
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,600
- Anna.

209
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,500
Happy anniversary.

210
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
Stop looking at me.

211
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,200
I don't like when people
look at me like that.

212
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,900
- Okay.

213
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,900
I walk this way to school
with Tommy Tammisimo.

214
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,900
Is he your best buddy?

215
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,900
He hates me.

216
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,400
Do you hate him?

217
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,500
No.

218
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,300
Did your mom
set that up?

219
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,200
Yes.

220
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,600
Did you ever talk to your mom
about how things are with Tommy?

221
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,900
- I don't tell her things.
- Why not?

222
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,600
'Cause she doesn't look at me like
everybody else, and I don't want her to.

223
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,400
- I don't want her to know.
- Know what?

224
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,900
That I'm a freak.

225
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,100
Hey.

226
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,100
You are not a freak.
Okay?

227
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:05,000
Don't you believe anybody that tries to
convince you of that. That's bullshit.

228
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,400
You don't have to go through
your life believing that.

229
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,000
Okay?

230
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,400
Come on.

231
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,700
- You said the "S" word.
- Yeah, I know.

232
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,800
Sorry.

233
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,300
So your dad lives
in Pittsburgh with a lady...

234
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,700
that works in a tollbooth?

235
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,200
I wonder if she has to pee
when she's working.

236
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,300
Think she just holds it?

237
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,600
I don't know. I was just
thinking about that myself.

238
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,500
You asked a lot of questions
about Dad today.

239
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,800
How come?

240
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,700
Well, sometimes we do things
to draw attention,

241
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:02,900
to express our feelings
about certain issues--

242
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,300
divorce, whatever.

243
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:10,000
For example, a person might
leave something on the desk
for someone else to find.

244
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,100
Do you know what free
association writing is, Cole?

245
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,500
No.

246
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,900
Free association writing
is when you take a pencil in your hand,

247
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:30,300
and you put the pencil to apiece
of paper and you start writing.

248
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,100
And you don't look
at what you're writing or
think about what you're writing.

249
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,600
You just keep
Your hand moving.

250
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,600
And after a while, if you keep
Your hand moving long enough,

251
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,200
words and thoughts start coming out that
you didn't even know you had in you.

252
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,600
It could be something
you heard somewhere else,

253
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,900
or feelings you had
deep inside of you.

254
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,200
Have you ever done any
free association writing, Cole?

255
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Yes.

256
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,100
What did you write?

257
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,500
Upset words.

258
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,700
Did you ever write any upset words
before your father left?

259
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,100
I don't remember.

260
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,200
Can you do something for me?

261
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,500
I want you to think about what you
wanna get out of our time together--

262
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,400
what our goal should be.

263
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,600
Something I want?

264
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,100
If you could change something
in your life, anything at all,

265
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,100
what would it be?

266
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,400
Instead of something I want,
can it be something I don't want?

267
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,100
Okay.

268
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,600
I don't want to be
scared anymore.

269
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
You gonna get that?

270
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,000
Are you gonna get that?

271
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,900
- Hi.
- Hi.

272
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,600
- Don't you see enough of me
at the store?
- Yeah, I'm on my way out...

273
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,600
to the flea market
in the Amish country.

274
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,600
I thought maybe you'd
wanna come along...

275
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,400
and show me how to buy
at one of these things.

276
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,300
I don't know if I can deal
with the Amish today.

277
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,900
You can't curse or spit
or anything around them.

278
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,900
I just figured maybe you'd just want to
get out and get some air,

279
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,200
because you've seemed
kind of down lately.

280
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,200
Um, I'm okay.

281
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,100
Do you think that maybe I should stop by
on the way back, show you what I got?

282
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,500
Because that
wouldn't be a problem.

283
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,000
No, I- You know,
I can see on Monday.

284
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Sure, yeah, that's fine.
I'm just--

285
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,800
Okay, so I guess I'm gonna get going
then. I'll speak to you later.

286
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,600
- Don't step in the horse manure.
- Thank you very much.

287
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,100
Keep moving, cheese dick.

288
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:48,800
Can anybody guess what city was capital
of the United States of America...

289
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,100
from 1 790 to 1 800?

290
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,700
I'll give you a hint:
It's the city you live in.

291
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,700
- Philadelphia!
- Right, right.

292
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,300
Philadelphia's one of the oldest cities
in this country.

293
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,700
A lot of generations
have lived here and died here.

294
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:12,400
Almost any place you go in this city
has a history and a story behind it.

295
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,500
Even this school
and the grounds it sits on.

296
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:20,200
Can anyone guess what this building
was used for a hundred years ago...

297
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,100
before you went to school here,
before I went to this school even?

298
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,500
Yes, Cole.

299
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,900
They used to hang people here.

300
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,400
No, uh, that--Mm- mm. That's
not correct. Where'd you hear that?

301
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,600
They pulled the people in, crying
and kissing their families bye.

302
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,400
People watching...
spit at them.

303
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,700
Uh, Cole, this building
was a legal courthouse.

304
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,200
Laws were passed here--some of
the very first laws of this country.

305
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,400
This whole building
was full of, uh, lawyers,

306
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,700
- lawmakers.
- They were the ones
that hanged everybody.

307
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,900
Uh--

308
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,700
I don't know which one
of these guys told you that,

309
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,800
but, uh, they were
Just trying to scare you.

310
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,700
I don't like people
looking at me like that.

311
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Like what?

312
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,200
Stop it!

313
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,700
I, uh, I- I- I don't know
how else to look.

314
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,000
You're Stuttering Stanley!

315
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,800
- Excuse me?
- You talked funny when
you went to school here.

316
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,700
You talked funny
all the way to high school.

317
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:58,700
- What?
- You shouldn't look at people.
It makes them feel bad.

318
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,800
- How did you--
- Stop looking at me!

319
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,000
Who have you--[Stammering]
been speaking to?

320
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,600
Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley!

321
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,900
- Stop it. St- St- St--
- Stuttering Stanley!

322
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,700
- Stop that!
- Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley!

323
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,700
Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley!

324
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,200
Shut up, you f- f- freak!

325
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,200
Hey, big guy.

326
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,000
How's it goin'?

327
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,300
I don't wanna talk about
anything right now.

328
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,200
Okay.

329
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,700
You like magic?

330
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,600
Hmm?

331
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,800
Observe:
The magic penny.

332
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,100
Looks like
an ordinary penny.

333
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,600
But I do my little
magic shake, and...

334
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,300
now it's in my right hand.

335
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,200
But that's not the end
of the magic trick.

336
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,400
I do another
little shake, and...

337
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,700
right there
in the vest pocket.

338
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,700
But that's not the end
of the magic trick.

339
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,300
I do another little shake...

340
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,300
and...

341
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,800
right back in the left hand
where it started.

342
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,500
That isn't magic.

343
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,400
What are you talking about?
Of course it's magic.

344
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,000
You just kept the penny
in that hand the whole time.

345
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,700
Think so?

346
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,400
I didn't know you were funny.

347
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:27,200
Malcolm, sit your cute
butt down and listen up.

348
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,200
No doubt about it.
Anna is like my sister.

349
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,200
And you better make her happy.
I'm not talkin' about no...

350
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,900
"Mmm, this taste like
real butter" kind of happy.

351
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:42,000
I'm talkin' about--
What's up, girl?

352
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,600
"Julie Andrews
twirling around like...

353
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,100
a mental patient on a mountaintop"
kind of happy.

354
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,400
That's the kind of happy
I'm talkin' about.

355
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,400
Shh. Come here.

356
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,000
Don't tell her I told you,

357
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,500
but she said
she knew she love you...

358
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,400
from the first time
she met you on the street.

359
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:07,000
She´d do anything for you.

360
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I love you guys.

361
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,900
My nose is running.
Turn it--

362
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,400
And then you do
the magic shake.

363
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,000
The penny has moved
from my pocket...

364
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,200
all the way back
to the hand it started in.

365
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,900
That's stupid.

366
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,600
It's supposed
to be funny.

367
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,000
It's stupid.
I want my penny back.

368
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,100
He doesn't get
invited places, so it's our pleasure.

369
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,600
Last time was a Chuck E. Cheese
party a year ago.

370
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:07,900
He hid in one of those purple plastic
tunnels and didn't come out.

371
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,000
- Chucky who?
- Cheese. It's a kids place.

372
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,900
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

373
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,700
Is someone out there?

374
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,200
Open this door, please.
Come on.

375
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:59,100
I can't breathe.
If you can hear me, open this door.

376
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:03,400
I swear on my life I didn't
take the master's horse.

377
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,100
Open this door, or I'll
break through it and grab you!

378
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:11,700
- The star of the commercial
always gets his own trailer.
- For what?

379
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,900
He needs a place to think
about his character, alone.

380
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,200
- You only had one line.

381
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,000
Derrick, check it out.

382
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,400
Oh, yeah.

383
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,600
My dad
made me invite him.

384
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,600
Happy birthday, Derrick.

385
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,900
Is there somethin'
you want to see in there?

386
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,300
No.

387
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,500
We're gonna put on
a pretend play.

388
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:00,500
- Wanna be in it?
- Okay.

389
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:04,300
It's called
" Locked in the Dungeon."

390
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,600
Yes, Cole, and, uh, you get to be
the one locked in the dungeon.

391
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,700
Don't! Don't!
Don't! Don't!

392
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:17,500
Don´t!

393
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,300
Let me out! No! No!

394
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,600
No! No!

395
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,000
- Cole?

396
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,800
- Cole!

397
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,700
Is there a key
for this door?

398
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:58,600
Cole? Honey?
Honey, can you hear me?

399
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,000
Oh, my God! Cole!

400
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,500
Help me! Help!
Help! Help!

401
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,100
The tests would indicate
he did not have a seizure.

402
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,600
He's doing fine.

403
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,100
After some rest,
he can go home tonight.

404
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,900
There's some cuts and
bruises on your son...

405
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,900
- that are concerning me.
- Oh, man.

406
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,900
Yeah, those are from sports.

407
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,900
You think I hurt my child?

408
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,800
You think I'm a bad mother?

409
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,900
Mrs. Sloan over there,

410
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,600
she's a social worker
with the hospital.

411
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,400
She's gonna ask you a couple
procedural questions.

412
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,100
What happened
to my child today?

413
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:18,400
Something was happening to him,
physically happening.
Something was very wrong!

414
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,700
Hey.

415
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,500
Did your father used to
tell you bedtime stories?

416
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,200
Once upon a time
there was this young prince,

417
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:57,000
and he decided that
he wanted to go for a drive.

418
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,100
He go this driver,
and they started driving.

419
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:05,300
Driving, driving.

420
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,800
Driving a lot.

421
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,500
And, uh,

422
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:14,200
they drove so much
that he fell asleep.

423
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,100
And--

424
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:23,300
Then he woke up, and he realized
they were still driving.

425
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,700
- This was a very long trip.
- Dr. Crowe?

426
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,300
You haven't told
bedtime stories before.

427
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,600
Uh, not too many, no.

428
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,000
You have to add
some twists and stuff.

429
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,900
Okay. Some twists.

430
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,900
Like what kind of twists?
Give me an example.

431
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:49,300
- Maybe they run out of gas.
- They run out of gas?

432
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:52,500
That's good, 'cause they're driving,
right? Okay, so--

433
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,800
Tell me the story
about why you're sad.

434
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,800
You think I'm sad?

435
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,700
What makes you think that?

436
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,800
Your eyes told me.

437
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,200
Not supposed to talk
about stuff like that.

438
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,800
Once upon a time, there was
this person named Malcolm.

439
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,300
He worked with children.

440
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,500
He loved it.

441
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,500
He loved it
more than anything else.

442
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
And then one night,
he found out that...

443
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,300
he made a mistake
with one of them.

444
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,900
He couldn't help that one.

445
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,100
And he can't stop
thinking about it.

446
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,400
He can't forget.

447
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,900
Ever since then,
things have been different.

448
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:04,700
He's not the same person
that he used to be.

449
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,800
And his wife...

450
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,600
doesn't like the person
that he's become.

451
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,200
They barely speak anymore.
They're like strangers.

452
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:22,400
And then one day, Malcolm meets
this wonderful little boy.

453
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,200
A really cool little boy.

454
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,700
Reminds him a lot
of the other one.

455
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,500
And Malcolm decides
to try and help this new boy...

456
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:41,200
'cause he feels that
if he can help this new boy,

457
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:46,000
it will be like...
helping that other one too.

458
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,200
How does the story end?

459
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,900
I don't know.

460
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:15,300
I wanna tell you
my secret now.

461
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,000
Okay.

462
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,600
I see dead people.

463
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,100
In your dreams?

464
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,300
While you're awake?

465
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,800
Dead people, like,
in graves, in coffins?

466
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,100
Walking around
like regular people.

467
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,800
They don't see each other.

468
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,500
They only see
what they wanna see.

469
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,800
They don't know they're dead.

470
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,600
How often do you see them?

471
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,500
All the time.

472
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,100
They're everywhere.

473
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:24,000
You won't tell anyone
my secret, right?

474
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,500
No. I promise.

475
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,400
Will you stay here
until I fall asleep?

476
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,000
Of course.

477
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:51,600
Cole has pathologies
more severe than initially assessed.

478
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,700
He's suffering from
visual hallucinations,

479
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:58,500
- paranoia,

480
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:02,500
some kind of...
school- age schizophrenia.

481
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:08,000
Medication, hospitalization
may be required.

482
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,700
And I'm not helping him.

483
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,800
Hi, this is Lynn Sear,
Cole's mom.

484
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,200
Yeah, uh, I--
I'd like to talk to you...

485
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:56,000
about your boy and his friends keeping
their goddamn hands off my son.

486
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,000
Mama?

487
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:39,700
No, dinner
is not ready!

488
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:42,400
What are you
gonna do?

489
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,000
You can't hurt me
anymore!

490
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,300
Neddy! You're a terrible
husband, Neddy!

491
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:52,300
Look what you made me do!
Neddy!

492
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,100
Once there was a boy,

493
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,700
very different
from all the other boys.

494
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:20,700
He lived in the jungle,

495
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:24,300
and he could speak
to the animals.

496
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,900
Did you think the play
sucked big time?

497
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:44,200
What?

498
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,700
Tommy Tammisimo acted
in a cough syrup commercial.

499
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:50,500
He said everyone was self- conscious
and unrealistic.

500
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,700
He said the play
sucked big time.

501
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,400
This Tommy kid sounds
like a real punk.

502
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:01,300
I thought the play was excellent.
Better than "Cats. "

503
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,800
- "Cats"?
- Never mind.

504
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:09,700
Cole, I was really interested
in what you told me at the hospital.

505
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:12,300
I'd like to hear
more about it.

506
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,900
Cole?

507
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,700
What?

508
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:45,300
Is something
up there?

509
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,800
Cole,

510
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,900
I don't
see anything.

511
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:03,900
Be real still.

512
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,700
Sometimes you
feel it inside,

513
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:12,600
like you're falling down
real fast,

514
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,600
but you're really
Just standing still.

515
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:24,500
You ever feel the prickly things
on the back of your neck?

516
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,500
Yes.

517
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:31,400
And the tiny hairs on your arm,
you know, when they stand up?

518
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:34,000
Yes.

519
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:38,400
That's them.

520
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,400
When they get mad,

521
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,800
it gets cold.

522
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,100
I don't see anything.
Are you sure they're there?

523
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,300
Cole?

524
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,900
Please make them leave.

525
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:21,400
I'm workin' on it.

526
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:25,700
Come on.

527
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:55,300
Aah!

528
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,600
Mommy, Daddy?

529
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,200
My throat hurts.
