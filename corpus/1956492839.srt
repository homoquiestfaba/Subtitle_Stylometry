1
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,141
Stop. Please stop.

2
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:25,359
It looks like you have just stamped out.

3
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,946
Major Vaunt.

4
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,449
Tack, Major Vaunt.

5
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,911
Do not thank me, thank energy drink ENRG.

6
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,793
Energy drink ENRG not recommend ...

7
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,461
I agree with.

8
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,589
It's amazing how much sweat contained in the panty liners.

9
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,968
Major vaunt is the new spokesman for energy drink ENRG.

10
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,887
What a traitor.

11
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,139
- Do you know what it tastes like? - My own sweat?

12
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:59,852
It's not something I talk about in public, but ...

13
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,396
I mean the energy drink.

14
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,984
It's disgusting. It tastes like burnt hair.

15
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,903
Hey, your zeros.

16
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,197
Let us, Bernice.

17
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:15,200
It smells of crushed dreams here.

18
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:18,161
And now smell the tears and Tumblr.

19
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:22,082
Should not you pretend to be superheroes somewhere?

20
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:26,044
Should not you be somewhere and tempt someone with an apple?

21
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,841
It's been a slow day. What happens?

22
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,927
Year ten must make a karriäruppsats-

23
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:36,096
-for business economy course.

24
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,932
And because my parents do not live longer-

25
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:42,811
- and my foster parents would enter their current yrken-

26
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:44,813
-As government spenabarn-

27
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:48,775
- I've come to interview you two zeros for my essay.

28
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:54,656
That includes peanut butter, so it's best you let it be.

29
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,159
Now that I think demand

30
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,995
Eat them all.

31
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,207
Do you have Snapchat? For you are a real shit.

32
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,751
I do not understand, but I should probably be angry.

33
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,628
Because you're old.

34
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,047
- What mumbling about? - They are talking...

35
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,591
- if Starletta on Megaline.com. - What?

36
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,301
And.

37
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:20,432
"The beloved super hero Starletta get the city's key"

38
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:26,563
- a few hours after signing the contract with the superhero Agency CMM

39
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,566
"-Creative Masked Management."

40
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,236
I know, it's no big deal.

41
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,280
- Stop. - I understand that it makes you upset.

42
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:39,535
- I just want to finish reading. - You do not need to read this.

43
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:42,663
They sign a contract with anyone these days.

44
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:46,416
You're probably tired of hearing this, where home

45
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,001
But why are you here?

46
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:54,091
Do you realize that you are the saddest superheroes in the world?

47
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,802
You do not even have any super powers.

48
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:01,348
What kind of superhero has no super powers?

49
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,977
I wish your father had dried up with a napkin.

50
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,272
Okay, hear, young, susceptible Bernice.

51
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,483
You do not need super powers superhero.

52
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:14,361
- No. - A superhero without super powers ...

53
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,739
- is superpatetisk. - I appreciate the pun ...

54
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:20,450
but some of the shadow of war heroes ...

55
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,578
- had no forces. - Exactly.

56
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:25,289
- Shadow War? - At Buseys mother.

57
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:29,168
How do you feel not to the shadow war? What they teach you in school?

58
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,714
- Sorry, they learn important things. - Oh my God.

59
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:37,968
Shadow War was the ultimate battle between heroes and villains.

60
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,721
Legendary heroes lost life-

61
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,140
- to protect innocent citizens like you.

62
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,310
- Like you. - And after several years of warfare ...

63
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,936
won hjältarna-

64
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,398
-and freed the world from super villains.

65
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,816
And.

66
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,820
- It is quite important. - It is very important, Bernice.

67
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,530
It's very important.

68
00:03:58,614 --> 00:03:59,865
I get it.

69
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:04,411
So when the super villains disappeared degraded superhjältarna-

70
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,580
-to usual security guards.

71
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,668
- Cool. - Listen very carefully, Bernice.

72
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:15,047
I would never hit a child.

73
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,383
But I would beat this tasteful kudden-

74
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,802
-and pretend it was your face.

75
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,387
"Tasteful"? Not directly.

76
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,515
- Oh my God! - Okay, come on.

77
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,475
- Go home now. - My thesis, then?

78
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,144
Maybe you should write about the shadow war.

79
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:32,564
Those unable history are doomed to repeat it.

80
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:35,192
You know what they say about repeating their clothes.

81
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,860
Okay thanks. Bye.

82
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,490
We should invest in a lock.

83
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,761
Tits.

84
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:05,389
- What? - I just...

85
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:10,394
I'm thinking of Starletta always shows her tits.

86
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,729
I'm also thinking sometimes.

87
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:16,942
I'm frustrated for all the attention she gets, as we should have.

88
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:20,529
Is it tuttarnas sake? So it can not be.

89
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:25,284
She is certainly very nice. Tits does not save lives. We save lives.

90
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,244
We have saved lives.

91
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,581
We have saved lives for years. We have protected the oskyldiga-

92
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,624
And no one notices us.

93
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,794
People lay certainly notice us. We wear colorful costumes.

94
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:38,589
Okay.

95
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,301
It seems that someone is suffering from a dangerous combination-

96
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:46,388
- low self-esteem and low blood sugar. We buy a slushy.

97
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:52,603
I'll keep my Fritos.

98
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,272
And I will get nausea in silence.

99
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,358
- Thanks. - No problems.

100
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:03,614
But I must admit that Starletta is stylish.

101
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,781
She sucks.

102
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,575
- Yes, she sucks ... - What?

103
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,160
- I did not say anything. - Okay.

104
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:11,955
Megaline.com should do a story on us. We do a good job.

105
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,416
- It does not matter. - We are not treated as heroes.

106
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,419
Do you really what Bernice said seriously?

107
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:20,339
- She's just a child. - Electra Woman and Dyna Girl.

108
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:23,592
- Hey, Lenny. - How are my favorite heroes?

109
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:27,262
- My life today, Lenny. - Something of an exaggeration.

110
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:30,015
She has a point. We have no super powers.

111
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,683
What makes us heroes?

112
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:34,937
Some of our greatest heroes had no super powers.

113
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,730
- A million years ago. - Oh my God.

114
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:40,859
It takes more than super powers to be a superhero.

115
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:43,695
Moreover, we have done a good job

116
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:46,573
- to keep the city safe. You should be proud.

117
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:49,826
Give me all the money in the cashier. Put them in the bag. Now!

118
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,120
And give us some Slim Jim, too.

119
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:54,373
- I'm a little hungry. - Yes.

120
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:59,461
Hello, gentlemen. I see you've met our friend Lenny.

121
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:02,798
Stop recording, otherwise I drive up mobiles

122
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,592
- so deep that you must Kegelträna to answer.

123
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:08,679
- I've heard things about Kegel. - Strange things.

124
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,934
Do you want to get shot? Stick.

125
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,269
And.

126
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,896
Cool butterfly knife, pal.

127
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,715
- Is it bad? - Yes, it's bad.

128
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:59,021
- You said you fixed the Electra-hungry. - Dyna-craving, called it.

129
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,440
I won it there Gamble party.

130
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,610
- I had to rename it. - It does not count as a win ...

131
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,195
to spy on the board.

132
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:07,738
I was food poisoning.

133
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,072
Oh my God.

134
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,783
I disarmed him, at least.

135
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:15,454
- You are holding a human arm. - I'm holding a human arm.

136
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:21,001
You looks great. And now I'll download it here videon-

137
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,754
- so that your friends can see what you've been up to.

138
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:27,799
Just a couple of blockheads who got whipped by two damer-

139
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:29,968
-iförda spandex suits.

140
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:34,097
- Something to add? - Yes, film is not vertically.

141
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,183
So there.

142
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,060
- It looks worse. - I get it.

143
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,520
And.

144
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:43,023
Do your thing. One of them might need a patch.

145
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,108
- Download a mop too. - Goodbye, Lenny.

146
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,446
Lori.

147
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,574
- Lori. - What is it?

148
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:54,743
Tell your phone to be silent.

149
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,120
But I do not want to cook äppelpaj-

150
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,789
-president Taft.

151
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,834
- Lori. - What is it?

152
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,502
Okay.

153
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,090
Sure, it was fun today?

154
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:11,301
It was fine, but we need to tighten us.

155
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,428
We can not work with poor equipment.

156
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:17,558
I'm doing the best I can with what we have. We can barely afford ...

157
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,518
- Holy shit. - What is it?

158
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,187
- Do you see a spider? How many? - Holy shit.

159
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,940
CMM want to have a meeting with us in Hollywood.

160
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:27,317
So it's not spiders.

161
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:30,737
An agent saw the video where we take care of the guys from Lenny.

162
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:33,407
- What? - Apparently, some others ...

163
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,200
Also seen video.

164
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:38,412
A million views? How is this possible?

165
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,832
Because the Internet is both terrible and wonderful.

166
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,333
Jude, CMM.

167
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,258
What? No. No murmurs.

168
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,218
Well, I mumble.

169
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:54,928
I do not know.

170
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:57,556
I do not want to be a traitor.

171
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,394
We are not traitors. We always wanted to be more successful.

172
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:06,231
We do not do this for money. We want to make a difference.

173
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:10,777
Yes, but unfortunately we barely afford the rent, so we need the money.

174
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:14,740
Out there, we can make a difference and earn loot.

175
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:19,369
Picture this, Jude.

176
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,413
We need to fight.

177
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,290
We can take a real chance.

178
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:27,544
An opportunity to make a greater difference than we can in Ohio.

179
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,796
It is the moment we've been waiting for.

180
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,092
And we've been waiting a long time.

181
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:38,931
Promise you that we will not change in any way?

182
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:43,602
I promise we will not develop in different directions ...

183
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,897
- if that's what you're afraid of. - Thanks.

184
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,532
Electra Woman and Dyna Girl goes to Hollywood.

185
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:02,579
- Electra Woman and Dyna Girl ... - Why did you send that?

186
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:05,040
I thought it was Snapchat. Damn it.

187
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:28,981
Okay, so we do not agree on anything today, right?

188
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:33,068
We listen to him, shaking hands and think about it.

189
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:36,655
No hasty decision. If they want to change us so let's go.

190
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,323
Dyna, we are classic.

191
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:40,784
- There is no need for changes. - Okay.

192
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:48,709
- Holy shit, it was Mister Fabulous. - Be cool.

193
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:53,922
- Hello. - Hello.

194
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:56,216
We are Electra Woman and Dyna Girl.

195
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,635
We will meet Dan Dixon.

196
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:04,057
Electra Woman and Dyna Girl is here to see you.

197
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:06,643
Turn is ner, he comes strax.

198
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:20,115
I do not know if I was nervous of how handsome he is-

199
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:22,326
-or if the burrito was poor.

200
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,161
You can not stand so much cheese.

201
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:28,040
It's more than that. Tell me if this is weird.

202
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:31,960
Last week I ate a Beigel, and 20 minutes later ...

203
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,760
- I used so much paper. - I feel sorry for the cat.

204
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,182
- Nice trick. - Thanks. Do you have any powers?

205
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,600
I have superhuman hearing.

206
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,021
And.

207
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,441
- I'm so sorry. - You should go to the doctor.

208
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:57,277
Electra Woman and Dyna Girl, Dan is waiting for you.

209
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:59,196
Thank God.

210
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,782
You should wear a sign.

211
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:07,079
There they are. Electric Girl and Dynamic Woman.

212
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,039
You confused us.

213
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:12,376
Sit down. I heard you ran here.

214
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,294
We could have flown you here.

215
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:18,382
We did not want to leave the Electra-car. It is part of our thing.

216
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:22,177
Electra-car, yes. I saw a picture on the scrap heap.

217
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:26,014
But that's part of its charm. It needs a little upgrade.

218
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:27,182
We drive on it.

219
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,603
Dried meat?

220
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,069
Are you a fan?

221
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,492
When I discovered the Major vaunt he worked part-time at Hot Topic.

222
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:48,704
Two months later, he had three campaigns.

223
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:52,457
Four months later, he had five best-sellers.

224
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:56,503
He is one of the world's biggest personalities.

225
00:13:56,587 --> 00:14:01,175
So he is the greatest super hero because of you?

226
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:04,344
And I'll do the same for you.

227
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:10,893
I love everything about you, girls.

228
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:15,647
I do not want to change anything. Not a single thing.

229
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:17,858
But I want to improve a couple of things.

230
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,987
So I'll mention a couple of ideas and see what works.

231
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,490
Most of it will work. Let's talk about your logos.

232
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:27,159
I designed them.

233
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:29,328
Obvious. You are an initiator.

234
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:32,122
I love it more than my mother, may she rest in peace.

235
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:35,125
- I'm sorry. - She's alive, but she's dead to me.

236
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:39,129
Never delete things from my TiVo.

237
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:42,883
Everything is there for a reason.

238
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,760
Everything.

239
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:48,972
So the logos must be removed. Let's talk about your background history.

240
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,726
Liver your parents?

241
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,019
- And. - And.

242
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,229
Thats a pity.

243
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:58,815
I mean, it's great, but it's a shame.

244
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:01,235
People love a tragic backstory.

245
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:05,364
As someone you loved was killed and Electra Woman swore revenge.

246
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,616
Yes, but failed to do so.

247
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:11,703
We say that your parents were ihjälskjutna-

248
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:14,414
-i Little Tokyo, during a gang war.

249
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:17,084
Wait, we are not considering a fake backstory.

250
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,211
It is not false.

251
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,755
- It's just not true. - Like Santa.

252
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,842
Remind me, Kevin.

253
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,844
You rock.

254
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:31,807
But people can check facts online.

255
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:36,311
The network, huh? Buffoon. I love it.

256
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:39,898
I love your passion.

257
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:42,609
Not? Okay.

258
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:46,780
It's getting hot in here.

259
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:49,032
I feel the heat. I love the heat.

260
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:52,160
I am passionate about. Do you feel the heat?

261
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:53,871
We take a walk.

262
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,206
- Okay. - And your widgets.

263
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,459
- I love the sucker. - Thanks. Dyna-hungry.

264
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:01,920
Disturbed Funny. When the guy arm flew of-

265
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:04,548
- I laughed spat out teeth whitening agent.

266
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,551
And people loved it. This time.

267
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,846
Next time it could get worse. Take it easy with dismemberment.

268
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:15,392
- We are your new outfits. - Wait, I do our costumes.

269
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,312
- Cute. - Dan, I love your enthusiasm ...

270
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:23,400
but this does not work for us. We like to run our own race.

271
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,903
- Right, Electra Woman? - Captain Rhinestone?

272
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,821
Listen, girls.

273
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:31,909
The last thing I want to do is undermine your integrity.

274
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,077
No no.

275
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:38,665
But superheroes who do not have the right marketing

276
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:40,125
-försvinner.

277
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:43,712
Will you be like Galacto Commando or Mirth Man?

278
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:45,672
Where are they now? Nobody knows.

279
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:50,010
I read that Mirth Man involved in charity in Sudan.

280
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:53,514
I admit that I do not know where Sudan ligger-

281
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:56,934
But I know no one else does either.

282
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:58,560
It is true, I have no idea.

283
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,313
Ready to see your new toys?

284
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:10,948
This is where the magic happens.

285
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,533
Electra Woman, Dyna Girl-

286
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:16,078
- this is our research director, Frank Heflin.

287
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,287
Hello, my name is Frank.

288
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:19,831
Hey, Frank. Nice to meet you. Electra Woman.

289
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:21,792
Hi, my name Dyna Girl. Nicely lab.

290
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,253
What's that? World's Largest Google search?

291
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:27,798
It is the world's only brottoskop. It is kraftfullaste-

292
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:30,551
- analysis tool for law enforcement available.

293
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:33,053
Suffice geek talk. Come on.

294
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:36,390
- View their new costumes. - New costumes?

295
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,854
The suits are made of indestructible flexible nätmaska-

296
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:44,439
-and a reinforced lightweight armor.

297
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:46,859
I must admit that they look good.

298
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:50,988
But it would be nice to keep more of the original look.

299
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:54,366
The only thing we need from the original is your huvuden-

300
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:57,536
- in which the neck holes. Frank shot the rest here.

301
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:00,998
You will love what comes next. Dixon.

302
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:09,173
What do you mean that Major vaunt not intend to accept the offer?

303
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,425
He wants more money.

304
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,719
I have some news for him.

305
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:17,806
He will not get a better deal.

306
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:21,143
There he used to be.

307
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:22,394
Listen.

308
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:26,356
Tell that viktigpettern he's a pain.

309
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,360
If he wants to pay for his implant, he must accept the offer.

310
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:39,578
May I introduce ElectraCom.

311
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:43,415
With these devices, you can communicate with varandra-

312
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:48,212
- anywhere in the world via video, audio or text messages.

313
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:50,214
It sounds like a mobile.

314
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:54,843
It also projects an electrical discharge through a System

315
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:58,514
- responding to your muscle movements and brain signals ...

316
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:02,518
- the nerves in your wrists. - It does not sound like a mobile.

317
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:06,438
What they build there?

318
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:07,731
It is not finished yet.

319
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,025
Okay, that's enough for today.

320
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:12,152
Let's move on.

321
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:15,197
You are either younger or superigare.

322
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,991
You came here to play the game.

323
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:19,535
We have to think about it.

324
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:22,412
Great, let me leave you with some final words.

325
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:27,626
A great man once said that you never get a second chance.

326
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,628
- No second chance. - Who said that?

327
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,798
Nick Matteo i klassikern "Kazaam". Fin film.

328
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,508
- You should get a copy. - We're with.

329
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:35,759
You?

330
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:38,178
- Because of "Kazaam"? - Good news.

331
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:40,973
We will do great things.

332
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:42,516
Remind me, Kevin.

333
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,601
You rock.

334
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:56,446
Want to go and see the Hollywood sign?

335
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,699
Perhaps drive to the beach?

336
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:03,412
Maybe stop pretending that I do not know how angry you are?

337
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:04,621
I'm not mad.

338
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:06,999
And I'm not trying to keep farts inside.

339
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:08,834
Are you angry because the contract with the CMM?

340
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,252
Perhaps.

341
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:14,006
I went along with it because you think too much.

342
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:17,509
It had taken several months for you to make a decision.

343
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:18,844
- It's not true. - Okay.

344
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:22,472
How long did it take for you to join the softball team?

345
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:24,141
Was it the whole middle school?

346
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:27,519
And then you jumped off after your first match.

347
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:31,231
- The shoes were uncomfortable. - I'm just trying to save time.

348
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:35,027
You were interested in as soon as you saw those uniforms.

349
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,487
This is good for us. We become true heroes.

350
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:39,656
First of all, we are already true heroes.

351
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,076
- And yes, the costumes were fine. - Yes, they were.

352
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,580
It's that positive attitude that I need.

353
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:52,711
Where the hell they parked our car?

354
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:08,393
- What are you doing? - Good morning.

355
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:10,562
What is this?

356
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:13,023
I'll get rid of our old equipment.

357
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:16,068
We could well have put it in a box and kept it?

358
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:20,572
Why? We will not use it now that we have these.

359
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:22,449
I guess not.

360
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:24,409
And ringer.

361
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,412
How's my favorite super babes?

362
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:30,582
- You've got your first job. - That went quick.

363
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:31,750
No time to rest.

364
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:35,587
You will participate in "Good Day USA" with Connie Westerthine-

365
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:37,840
-and eight million viewers stupid.

366
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:41,009
We give them an exclusive first look at your ElectraComs-

367
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:44,930
- and they pay a nice sum for it, so get ready.

368
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,515
You have two hours.

369
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:49,560
- So exciting. - I guess so.

370
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:53,313
You must admit that there is at least a little excited.

371
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:55,607
It's not the worst thing in the universe.

372
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:56,900
It's good enough.

373
00:21:58,026 --> 00:21:59,027
Superfine.

374
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:24,845
Fear not, Los Angeles. Your city just got even safer.

375
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:28,765
Electra Woman and Dyna Girl has arrived.

376
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:33,145
- That felt good. - Really good.

377
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:35,147
- Good heating. - In front of the people now?

378
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,273
- In front of people. - Okay.

379
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:37,399
- Okay. - Let's go.

380
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:42,029
Welcome back. I'm Connie Westerthine-

381
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:45,240
- and in the studio, we have with us a special surprise.

382
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:48,619
They took the super stage by storm and has quickly blivit-

383
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:50,454
- America's latest craze.

384
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:54,041
Electra Woman and her helpers, Dyna Girl.

385
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:56,668
Welcome, thanks for being here.

386
00:22:56,752 --> 00:22:59,338
- Thank you for letting us come. - Thanks.

387
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:02,966
Let's go straight to the point. I understand that we have-

388
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,052
s exclusive premiere today?

389
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:07,888
Yes, today we show our ElectraComs for the first time.

390
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:11,391
It is them we will use to keep you safe.

391
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:15,354
And what does your ElectraComs, exactly?

392
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:22,778
We have an emergency now outside our studio.

393
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:32,829
Tubes is.

394
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:35,457
Come on.

395
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:41,755
Hold on, guys. Let me take care of them here before we go.

396
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:44,883
- Oh no, what should we do? - I do not know.

397
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:54,560
Holy shit!

398
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:57,312
Okay, take them!

399
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,112
There were many weapons. Is this really fair?

400
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:24,631
Good job, little bracelet.

401
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:30,387
Now we make something cool out of it.

402
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:13,680
- What are you two? - Electra Woman and Dyna Girl.

403
00:25:13,764 --> 00:25:14,848
Just that!

404
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:18,810
- Oh my God. - No time for a victory dance.

405
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:21,855
Oh my God. We beat them.

406
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:31,532
Look at you. What clever you are.

407
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:33,617
I saw it on TV.

408
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,285
- You dance well. - Yes.

409
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:44,294
Dan, you saw us on TV?

410
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:47,214
I saw you on my TV, my computer and my cell phone.

411
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:49,633
You're everywhere, you coats.

412
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:52,386
But do me a favor.

413
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:55,097
Never do that victory dance again.

414
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,682
It was painful.

415
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:59,226
But everyone loves you.

416
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:03,105
Dyna Diva says: "You girls are an inspiration."

417
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:06,316
"Electra forever" says Squad Goals.

418
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,903
"I hate EW and DG" says a few zeros.

419
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:11,905
But you can not win all the time.

420
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:15,701
CMM will organize a party tonight to celebrate the two of you.

421
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:17,911
You should meet with clients and mingla-

422
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:19,705
But avoid the dance floor.

423
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:22,040
I took out a loan for the equipment.

424
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:23,417
I'm broke.

425
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,504
I know it seems far away, but you have to think about the future.

426
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:29,006
How does your retirement look like?

427
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:34,469
- Jack? - That's why I never get an Oscar.

428
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:36,180
Mr. Jones, you excuse us?

429
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:38,015
You're still one of the best.

430
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:39,474
- I love him. - Hello.

431
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:43,145
May I present the wonderful Electra Woman.

432
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:44,313
- Hello. - Hello.

433
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:48,025
Jack manages ENRG campaign that suktas demand

434
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:49,276
-of all heroes.

435
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:52,905
You are not before Jackie do any of you.

436
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:54,865
- Nice to meet you. - I know.

437
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:58,785
Hi, I'm Dyna Girl. Okay fun.

438
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:00,662
- Here. - Okay.

439
00:27:00,746 --> 00:27:04,499
Okay, Attention!

440
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:08,712
I want to thank you all for coming, but as you know-

441
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:12,424
- you are here to get free booze, your pigs.

442
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:15,886
But really, we are here tonight to FIRA

443
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:20,182
- the new girls and their first major rescue mission.

444
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:22,017
So let's show our the estimates

445
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:26,605
- Electra Woman and her helpers, Dyna Girl.

446
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:35,948
Make way for the Major.

447
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,909
You always have a grand entrance.

448
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:40,577
Just that.

449
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,998
- So what is this? - We celebrate everything related to vaunt to do.

450
00:27:45,082 --> 00:27:46,166
As it should be.

451
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:49,169
No, you have not done anything to deserve a celebration.

452
00:27:49,253 --> 00:27:51,964
We celebrate the new girl and her helpers.

453
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:53,340
Electra Woman.

454
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:57,219
I do not have a pen on me, so ...

455
00:27:57,302 --> 00:27:59,972
I do not want your autograph.

456
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:05,519
I usually do not do like this at parties, but I guess we can take a card.

457
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:07,396
Car?

458
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:09,273
I'll go and sit down.

459
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:11,984
It is okay.

460
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:16,530
It was me and cushion that stopped the robbery today.

461
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:20,701
Oh really? I think I heard something about that.

462
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:23,495
- You were lucky. - We had?

463
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:27,207
Yes, lucky that they were a bunch of amateurs.

464
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:31,503
If you had met the same scum like me, you would have whipped.

465
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:35,132
You tolerate certainly more whipped than I am.

466
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:37,676
I can tolerate more whipped than you can imagine.

467
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:41,930
Okay, nice to meet you.

468
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:53,275
- How's it going? - Hello.

469
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:55,569
Are you Electra Woman's aide?

470
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:57,905
I'm her partner, yes.

471
00:28:57,988 --> 00:28:59,865
I'm Winged Wingman.

472
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:01,950
It suggests not only what I can do.

473
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:04,995
I am also Major vaunts wingman in real life.

474
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:08,081
We are good friends.

475
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:12,711
But he prefers to do his own thing in this kind of celebrations.

476
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,421
It's okay with me.

477
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:16,715
It gives me a chance to do my own thing.

478
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:18,842
Spreading his wings, so to speak.

479
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:25,974
- I can talk to other aides. - I'm her assistant.

480
00:29:26,058 --> 00:29:27,935
I'm her partner.

481
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:32,940
We've been doing this since middle school.

482
00:29:33,023 --> 00:29:36,276
I used to often be retad-

483
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,987
And one day she defended me.

484
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:41,990
We were not friends at tillfället-

485
00:29:42,074 --> 00:29:45,869
- but she decided it was the right thing.

486
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:50,082
And since then, we have tried to do it.

487
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:52,000
The correct.

488
00:29:52,084 --> 00:29:55,796
So we are partners. As a team.

489
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:57,381
It was a nice story.

490
00:29:57,464 --> 00:30:00,092
It reminds me of how I and vaunt began.

491
00:30:00,175 --> 00:30:01,426
Too bad that everything changes.

492
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:04,721
Have a nice evening.

493
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:06,014
What's up?

494
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:29,913
Electra NEW BUDDY?

495
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:34,209
WHAT IS IN SUMMER

496
00:30:34,293 --> 00:30:37,504
LIFE IS SUPER

497
00:30:37,588 --> 00:30:41,592
ELECTRA WOMAN OCH DYNA GIRL

498
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:47,598
Donate a penny?

499
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:49,558
Donate a penny?

500
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:04,156
Electra Woman och Dyna Girl.

501
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:07,159
Donate a penny?

502
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:09,161
Donate a penny?

503
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:11,538
Do you hear! What the hell are you doing?

504
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:14,708
That's mine.

505
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:18,128
No!

506
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,559
Fatta you card, Frank.

507
00:31:32,643 --> 00:31:35,312
The new super suit you wanted is ready.

508
00:31:35,395 --> 00:31:38,315
Fine, thanks. Pack it for me, okay?

509
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:41,818
- Who is it for? - You ask too many questions.

510
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:43,070
It was just a question.

511
00:31:48,951 --> 00:31:50,827
Want to meet your favorite heroes?

512
00:31:50,911 --> 00:31:54,164
Then the 17th annual Super Party at the Los Angeles Convention Center-

513
00:31:54,248 --> 00:31:55,290
-right place for you.

514
00:31:55,374 --> 00:31:59,086
All your favorite heroes are available for photos, autographs and questions-

515
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:02,214
- during the day. Presented by ENRG.

516
00:32:02,297 --> 00:32:04,174
No personal photos!

517
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:08,971
You just got your mobile disintegrated by the disintegrator.

518
00:32:10,138 --> 00:32:11,265
How cool.

519
00:32:15,978 --> 00:32:17,646
It was a good question.

520
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:21,233
As most of you know, turns out to be krafter-

521
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:23,443
- mostly in high school. It was the same for me.

522
00:32:23,527 --> 00:32:26,238
One day I was sitting in class, and it happened.

523
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:29,449
It was like someone pressed a button, and there was I-

524
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:32,828
-and could talk to plants.

525
00:32:33,996 --> 00:32:38,000
It was amazing. I could not hold such a gift to myself.

526
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:40,294
Think how long we have levt-

527
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:43,505
- without knowing if a plant needs water or not.

528
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:46,049
Or if it needs to be replanted.

529
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:48,093
SUPER PARTY PRESENTS Perennial MAN

530
00:32:49,303 --> 00:32:54,474
I'm trying to do something here. No, excuse me.

531
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:56,977
I try to answer questions.

532
00:32:58,228 --> 00:33:03,066
Fuck you, then. Your shitty little trees.

533
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,610
I already have three autographs.

534
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,292
It's hard to sign a tiny image.

535
00:33:21,543 --> 00:33:26,298
I have thick index fingers. I have for my mother.

536
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:31,178
It might be easier if we had a photo of both of us.

537
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:34,306
It will never happen.

538
00:33:37,226 --> 00:33:38,602
Next.

539
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,315
Why is it so dead here?

540
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:45,692
- Where the hell is everybody? - Over there, apparently.

541
00:33:50,155 --> 00:33:52,574
Oh my God. I'll take a picture.

542
00:33:52,658 --> 00:33:54,159
- Out of the way. - I do not see anything.

543
00:33:56,912 --> 00:34:00,832
She always late should huh '. It does not feel good.

544
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:04,127
- Do you write a hat-haiku? - No, that was years ago last.

545
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:07,172
Late night with Starletta?

546
00:34:07,256 --> 00:34:10,425
My God, she threw her high-heeled Louboutin ...

547
00:34:10,509 --> 00:34:12,761
How do you pronounce it? It does not matter.

548
00:34:12,845 --> 00:34:14,972
She threw it on a brottsling-

549
00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:18,308
- in front of the Château Manu ... Mar ... How do you pronounce it?

550
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:21,144
It does not matter. It was amazing.

551
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:22,479
Sounds great.

552
00:34:22,563 --> 00:34:25,148
Too bad she can not travel in time.

553
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:28,443
Otherwise, she had been able to drop you off here 20 minutes ago.

554
00:34:34,825 --> 00:34:39,413
Have you passive-aggressive to you? It is my favorite perfume.

555
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:40,747
It was networking.

556
00:34:40,831 --> 00:34:44,209
She has many fans, so our profile improved if we meet with her.

557
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:46,336
We are ready.

558
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:51,133
Hi. Cool, I like it.

559
00:34:51,216 --> 00:34:53,844
"Lev lite."

560
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:57,598
Never be boring.

561
00:34:57,681 --> 00:34:59,558
"Från Electra Woman."

562
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:05,772
"Always on time.

563
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,150
Dyna Girl."

564
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:13,989
"PS, remember that you are a youth"

565
00:35:14,072 --> 00:35:18,869
-and should have fun while you can.

566
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:23,373
Which means you might come sent-

567
00:35:23,457 --> 00:35:29,087
"-A few minutes to the event."

568
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:37,554
"PPS, well, have fun while you can-"

569
00:35:37,638 --> 00:35:44,811
- but remember to invite your old friends as well.

570
00:35:44,895 --> 00:35:52,528
Some of them had loved to go out yesterday kväll-

571
00:35:52,611 --> 00:35:57,449
- instead of keeping track of brottsstatistik-

572
00:35:57,533 --> 00:35:59,952
-As nobody will ever see.

573
00:36:02,913 --> 00:36:07,501
"And listen to your heart."

574
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,003
Have a nice day.

575
00:36:10,087 --> 00:36:11,505
Next.

576
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:13,257
Tack.

577
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,176
"Ät skit."

578
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:23,392
"Ake mushrooms, for your health's sake."

579
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:30,190
Have a nice day.

580
00:36:30,274 --> 00:36:31,567
What's up?

581
00:36:43,662 --> 00:36:45,914
- What is it? - I'm ashamed of you.

582
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:48,333
- Why? - Seriously?

583
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:51,378
Out of the way, zeros.

584
00:36:52,713 --> 00:36:56,800
Would you look at that. Is not Electra Woman and Dung Girl.

585
00:36:56,884 --> 00:36:58,093
You?

586
00:36:58,177 --> 00:36:59,887
Dynga Girl.

587
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,763
You know, like dung.

588
00:37:01,847 --> 00:37:04,266
You try to be a hero, but you're dung.

589
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:07,102
It was good.

590
00:37:07,186 --> 00:37:08,812
I have no name for you yet.

591
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:12,274
It is obvious that you spent all your kreativitet-

592
00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:14,318
-and brilliance takes time.

593
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:18,197
I look forward to taking my breath. You better defenders.

594
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,490
This suit has seen better days.

595
00:37:22,326 --> 00:37:25,495
- What do you think of your first Super Fest? - It's okay. You?

596
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:27,998
Yes, sweaty.

597
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:31,168
It's different for veterans like us.

598
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:34,505
If you are kind to the big boys, you might survive.

599
00:37:34,588 --> 00:37:36,798
Most girls give up early.

600
00:37:36,882 --> 00:37:38,634
Why?

601
00:37:38,717 --> 00:37:41,929
Romantic feelings, klimakteriet-

602
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:44,181
-matprogram. Lots of stuff.

603
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:47,601
Then it must be relaxing for the big pojkarna-

604
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:53,607
- to not have to write so many autographs, because nobody cares about you.

605
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,735
Watch it, little girl.

606
00:37:56,818 --> 00:37:59,071
Otherwise I'll fit you.

607
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,573
Okay.

608
00:38:03,617 --> 00:38:07,120
Which people. I know the taste of their body sweat.

609
00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:10,457
- I have great stuff to talk about. - A new sponsor?

610
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:12,209
Not with you, vaunt. Them.

611
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:13,752
Come on. Big news.

612
00:38:13,836 --> 00:38:14,962
You?

613
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:19,424
I've fixed something substantial to my favorite girls.

614
00:38:19,508 --> 00:38:21,552
This was not easy.

615
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:24,847
I had to do some affärer-

616
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:28,350
- with some really bad guys, but it was worth it.

617
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:29,977
I've caught the elections.

618
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:35,232
A sponsor of the world's heroes will envy you for.

619
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:39,444
Guess who the two new spokespeople for ENRG is.

620
00:38:39,528 --> 00:38:40,946
Oh my God, we did it.

621
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:44,616
It was me who did it, but congratulate yourself anyway.

622
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,994
- Oh my God. - Look at this.

623
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:50,247
It's a war zone here in West Hollywood.

624
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:54,001
A mysterious woman appears to have fallen from himlen-

625
00:38:54,084 --> 00:38:56,461
-and caused destruction around.

626
00:38:56,545 --> 00:38:59,923
She seems unmoved by the police and their weapons.

627
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:02,759
We do not have all the facts, but it can move the signal

628
00:39:02,843 --> 00:39:06,430
- if the first super villain, then the shadow war.

629
00:39:06,513 --> 00:39:08,682
And superskurk?

630
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:10,601
We must do something.

631
00:39:11,977 --> 00:39:14,897
I would have helped, but I can not.

632
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,065
I have more to write autographs.

633
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:19,526
The public would respect a hero ...

634
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:24,615
- who do not keep their promises? - A year ago, I had helped.

635
00:39:24,698 --> 00:39:28,452
But I have a bad knee now.

636
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:32,748
We should let the police handle this. That's what they are for.

637
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:35,542
There are some plants that can take advantage ...

638
00:39:35,626 --> 00:39:36,668
You are excused.

639
00:39:36,752 --> 00:39:38,045
We can do this.

640
00:39:38,128 --> 00:39:42,925
- You're right. - Think of all the publicity.

641
00:39:43,008 --> 00:39:45,886
Thanks, but you should leave this to anyone-

642
00:39:45,969 --> 00:39:49,598
- with real super powers. I do not want you to go bad.

643
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:52,309
Come on, Wingman. Now we fly.

644
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:54,603
Seriously? I just got off my wings.

645
00:39:54,686 --> 00:39:56,772
You're talking shit.

646
00:39:58,023 --> 00:40:00,901
- I fit better ... - health problems ...

647
00:40:00,984 --> 00:40:01,985
Everybody.

648
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:07,407
This is the first super-villain we've seen in years.

649
00:40:07,491 --> 00:40:11,411
None of us has had to withstand such threats before.

650
00:40:11,495 --> 00:40:16,500
This reminds us of the previous heroes' time.

651
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:20,128
It is our turn to show the world what we're made of.

652
00:40:21,797 --> 00:40:24,633
If we unite, we can defeat this villain ...

653
00:40:24,716 --> 00:40:27,094
Boring.

654
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:31,098
Together.

655
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:34,101
We have just heard that the super villain called the signal

656
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:35,853
- Evil Empress.

657
00:40:37,187 --> 00:40:39,523
Okay, Empress. You are surrounded.

658
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:41,441
Give up now, so we can ...

659
00:40:43,902 --> 00:40:46,989
What now? It seems that the famous hero Major Vaunt-

660
00:40:47,072 --> 00:40:50,117
-have appeared to save us.

661
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,994
The Empress.

662
00:40:52,077 --> 00:40:53,912
Evil Empress.

663
00:40:53,996 --> 00:40:56,415
Certainly, evil empress.

664
00:40:56,498 --> 00:40:57,583
MAJOR vaunt save us

665
00:40:57,666 --> 00:40:59,251
Time to put this down.

666
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:00,836
SUPER HEAVY "evil EMPRESS"

667
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:02,963
I am here in the name of justice.

668
00:41:03,046 --> 00:41:06,717
Let's make this easier for both of us.

669
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,928
Okay, I'm ready.

670
00:41:10,012 --> 00:41:11,305
Where is vaunt?

671
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:14,725
- It's over. - You are right.

672
00:41:32,117 --> 00:41:33,785
Eld.

673
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:36,079
MAJOR vaunt murdered by evil EMPRESS

674
00:41:46,632 --> 00:41:49,801
He will surely be all right?

675
00:41:56,433 --> 00:41:58,894
NEWS

676
00:41:58,977 --> 00:42:00,604
SPECIALINSLAG

677
00:42:00,687 --> 00:42:02,397
Good morning, my name is Wallace Reed.

678
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:04,942
We continue to broadcast on tragedin-

679
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:07,361
- that shook Los Angeles last night.

680
00:42:07,444 --> 00:42:09,696
Around 20:00 ...

681
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,948
MAJOR vaunt IS DEAD

682
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:14,660
declared the right doctor to superhero Major vaunt is dead.

683
00:42:14,743 --> 00:42:18,580
The cause of death is said to be the huge hole through his body.

684
00:42:18,664 --> 00:42:21,458
He was murdered by someone who calls the signal

685
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:24,920
- Evil Empress. She is the first superskurken-

686
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:27,506
- which has been shown since the shadow war.

687
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:30,217
We have with us two people with different views.

688
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,803
First, from Los Angeles, Electra Woman.

689
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:34,596
Thank you, Wallace.

690
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,432
And Dyna Girl. I am also here, Wallace.

691
00:42:37,516 --> 00:42:39,351
Is my microphone even on?

692
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:42,563
And from New York, the sensationelle ...

693
00:42:42,646 --> 00:42:45,023
- Holy Cannoli. - Thanks, Wally.

694
00:42:45,107 --> 00:42:47,025
Let me ask you båda-

695
00:42:47,109 --> 00:42:49,862
What does yesterday's events?

696
00:42:49,945 --> 00:42:51,738
A proper supervillain?

697
00:42:51,822 --> 00:42:53,115
Should we worry?

698
00:42:53,198 --> 00:42:54,533
Good question, Wallace.

699
00:42:54,616 --> 00:42:56,410
The answer is no.

700
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:58,912
Major vaunt, may he rest in frid-

701
00:42:58,996 --> 00:43:02,416
- fought bravely, but failed to finish.

702
00:43:02,499 --> 00:43:04,084
I do not allow it.

703
00:43:04,168 --> 00:43:09,548
Justice will prevail. I'll force the Empress to her knees.

704
00:43:09,631 --> 00:43:13,051
We. We should force the Empress to her knees, Wallace. We.

705
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:16,096
Holy Cannoli, what do you say about this in your neighborhood?

706
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:20,142
This is of course a great tragedy, and a super villain?

707
00:43:20,225 --> 00:43:22,644
You have to be kidding. Stop it.

708
00:43:22,728 --> 00:43:27,441
But as far as we see it, even though we love Los Angeles

709
00:43:27,524 --> 00:43:31,445
- so we can not be involved. We have our own things to do.

710
00:43:31,528 --> 00:43:35,073
And without being disrespectful, she seems to be angry at Los Angeles.

711
00:43:35,157 --> 00:43:38,619
- So it has does not affect us. - We can do this.

712
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:41,121
There you have it. That's all.

713
00:43:41,205 --> 00:43:43,498
Hi mom. Cheer, Yankees.

714
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:48,921
We should ask Frank to see what he can see with brottoskopet.

715
00:43:49,004 --> 00:43:51,173
We know nothing about the Empress.

716
00:43:51,256 --> 00:43:54,968
Right. Frank, brottoskopet. Let him do it while we were filming.

717
00:43:55,052 --> 00:43:57,095
Wait, are we still filming commercials?

718
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:58,722
Why would not we?

719
00:43:58,805 --> 00:44:02,893
Because it is a crazy super villain loose and kill superheroes.

720
00:44:02,976 --> 00:44:05,521
You said yourself that we do not know anything about her.

721
00:44:05,604 --> 00:44:08,190
So while brottoskopet do whatever it do-

722
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:11,318
- we do what we should do and filming commercials.

723
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:14,947
Additionally, you will look so nice out.

724
00:44:19,076 --> 00:44:22,120
Get in on the other side. We must change.

725
00:44:24,957 --> 00:44:26,917
I have to go, Todd.

726
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,588
I hate you, Todd. No, shut up, Todd.

727
00:44:31,672 --> 00:44:34,925
Electra Woman and Dyna Girl. Lori and Judy, right?

728
00:44:35,008 --> 00:44:36,051
Just that.

729
00:44:36,134 --> 00:44:39,304
I just have a job today. Do you know what it is?

730
00:44:39,388 --> 00:44:43,141
You are the director, so I would guess that directing.

731
00:44:43,225 --> 00:44:47,938
Making super heroes to superstars.

732
00:44:48,021 --> 00:44:51,108
- Are you familiar with the concept? - No.

733
00:44:53,068 --> 00:44:55,237
We begin with a wide angle of the desert.

734
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,073
Your Silhouettes glitters in the distance through hettans waves.

735
00:44:58,156 --> 00:45:00,450
Sweat covers your skin as molasses.

736
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:10,252
A cool helicopter hovers in the distance, no reason.

737
00:45:10,335 --> 00:45:14,923
Then, when you approach a mysterious oasis, shows a group of sexy assassin.

738
00:45:15,007 --> 00:45:17,467
And you kick them down in vattnet-

739
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:20,804
- and jump in after them to finish them off.

740
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:23,223
But now you're wet, so what will you do?

741
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:27,102
So you take of you those gowns

742
00:45:27,186 --> 00:45:29,980
- and show your sexy, cruel bikinis.

743
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:33,233
But right next to you is two cans ENRG.

744
00:45:33,317 --> 00:45:37,196
We go in to a close-up when you turn on your solglasögonen-

745
00:45:37,279 --> 00:45:40,574
- and says, "annual leave is the only thing we can not take off."

746
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:44,328
But thanks to the energy drink ENRG we do not need it. "

747
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:47,664
Transition to black.

748
00:45:48,832 --> 00:45:50,375
And?

749
00:45:53,629 --> 00:45:55,172
Do you hear?

750
00:45:56,507 --> 00:46:00,135
It's the sound of all the world's tonårspojkar-

751
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:05,432
-As is male images of you both.

752
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,062
Can you give us a minute?

753
00:46:10,145 --> 00:46:12,397
And.

754
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:22,824
I do not know if excited mellanstadiepojkar-

755
00:46:22,908 --> 00:46:25,744
- is something we should strive for. Ever.

756
00:46:25,827 --> 00:46:27,746
- We're better than this. - The fact is...

757
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:30,457
that we have never been better, according jar.

758
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:32,042
YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN BETTER

759
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:33,335
So..

760
00:46:35,087 --> 00:46:37,339
Okay, calm down.

761
00:46:37,422 --> 00:46:40,384
Who cares if he would like to see some tits?

762
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:41,885
He has a vision.

763
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:45,639
Then you have to learn to choose what to fight for.

764
00:46:45,722 --> 00:46:48,308
- You know what? You are right. - Good. Let us...

765
00:46:48,392 --> 00:46:52,271
I choose not to do this. This is not us, Lori.

766
00:46:52,354 --> 00:46:56,149
I want us to be the best we can be.

767
00:46:56,233 --> 00:47:00,445
I'm with, and I do not want to sell myself to succeed.

768
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:04,199
You are so focused on a way to succeed ...

769
00:47:04,283 --> 00:47:08,161
- that you do not think about what is important. - It reminds me of someone.

770
00:47:08,245 --> 00:47:10,080
What do you mean?

771
00:47:10,163 --> 00:47:11,999
Me?

772
00:47:12,082 --> 00:47:14,626
Do you think I'm the problem?

773
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:17,212
You've had problems since we got here.

774
00:47:17,296 --> 00:47:21,633
Look around. It's stuff like this superheroes would kill for.

775
00:47:21,717 --> 00:47:24,386
And look at you. You're still not satisfied.

776
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:26,680
See it from my perspective.

777
00:47:26,763 --> 00:47:29,808
Everything we do is interview and advertising

778
00:47:29,892 --> 00:47:32,603
- and half the time vidkänns not even me.

779
00:47:32,686 --> 00:47:35,230
Great, so it's my fault because I'm more popular?

780
00:47:35,314 --> 00:47:37,733
I do not care if people like me.

781
00:47:37,816 --> 00:47:40,277
You do not care about anything.

782
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:45,324
I do not know what you're doing, but I make use of my opportunities.

783
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:47,993
I do not miss the Ohio or being broke.

784
00:47:48,076 --> 00:47:50,412
I do not miss not getting any respect.

785
00:47:50,495 --> 00:47:52,956
I have worked hard for this.

786
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,750
No, we've worked hard for this.

787
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:56,335
We're a team, remember?

788
00:47:59,254 --> 00:48:02,508
- I can not stand this anymore. - Yes.

789
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:06,053
I can not either.

790
00:48:06,136 --> 00:48:09,306
We calm down and talk about this later.

791
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:12,351
No, I can not anymore.

792
00:48:12,434 --> 00:48:16,772
If you do not want to do that I will be able to fend for yourself.

793
00:48:16,855 --> 00:48:19,191
Get a new costume, a new name, everything.

794
00:48:19,274 --> 00:48:21,068
See how it goes for you.

795
00:48:21,151 --> 00:48:24,196
- How can you ask me to go? - You better believe it.

796
00:48:24,279 --> 00:48:27,991
Electra-train going full speed ahead and it does not stop for anyone.

797
00:48:28,075 --> 00:48:31,870
- You sound like Dan. - Good. Dan is a winner.

798
00:48:31,954 --> 00:48:36,166
Your ass must be jealous of all the crap that comes out of your mouth.

799
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,335
- Great, go your way. - I will.

800
00:48:38,418 --> 00:48:41,213
- Move your feet. - That's how you go.

801
00:48:41,296 --> 00:48:43,924
Look who finally figured out how something works.

802
00:48:44,007 --> 00:48:46,552
- Stop, Lori. - Stop yourself, Judy.

803
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:55,769
I intend to do this yourself.

804
00:48:55,853 --> 00:49:00,858
And we can up the ante? It's not my grandmother advertising.

805
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:03,902
All right, you heard her. Here we go.

806
00:49:06,071 --> 00:49:09,408
- Home, please. - Okay, where is it?

807
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:14,162
I do not even know anymore.

808
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:26,216
Can you ask someone? I can not take all the streets ...

809
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:29,261
No, I know where I live, physically.

810
00:49:29,344 --> 00:49:32,181
I was just dramatic. Oh my God.

811
00:49:34,141 --> 00:49:36,143
You know what? Take me to the CMM.

812
00:49:46,737 --> 00:49:48,530
Here's your coffee.

813
00:49:51,158 --> 00:49:53,035
What is this?

814
00:49:53,118 --> 00:49:56,121
It's full of debris.

815
00:49:56,205 --> 00:49:59,541
I asked for a coffee without debris.

816
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:02,252
Pumpkin Spice. It burned.

817
00:50:02,336 --> 00:50:03,629
- Jack? - Yes?

818
00:50:03,712 --> 00:50:05,839
Your team is a bunch of amateurs.

819
00:50:05,923 --> 00:50:09,384
I have seen dogs crapping more professional than this.

820
00:50:09,468 --> 00:50:10,594
I will fix it.

821
00:50:10,677 --> 00:50:14,264
You are fired. Go home.

822
00:50:14,348 --> 00:50:15,641
Are we okay?

823
00:50:17,726 --> 00:50:20,354
And why do you have so many brushes?

824
00:50:20,437 --> 00:50:22,481
I'm just one person.

825
00:50:22,564 --> 00:50:24,107
With a face.

826
00:50:33,367 --> 00:50:36,954
- Hey, Frank. - Hey, Dyna Girl.

827
00:50:39,414 --> 00:50:41,333
What you build there?

828
00:50:41,416 --> 00:50:43,669
It is not finished yet.

829
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,310
Do you have something wrong with andningen-

830
00:51:00,394 --> 00:51:04,940
- or are you trying to imply something that I do not understand?

831
00:51:05,023 --> 00:51:08,318
You might ask Electra Woman explain it to me.

832
00:51:08,402 --> 00:51:11,446
Unfortunately, Frank. We grälade-

833
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:14,074
and she runs her own race now.

834
00:51:14,157 --> 00:51:16,201
Interesting.

835
00:51:25,252 --> 00:51:29,047
Okay, either there is something wrong with your lungs, or hope you-

836
00:51:29,131 --> 00:51:33,010
- I can solve your emotional problems with sound advice.

837
00:51:33,093 --> 00:51:35,971
I guess you will visit your doctor,

838
00:51:36,054 --> 00:51:41,435
- but just in case you really want my advice, then you should get it.

839
00:51:41,518 --> 00:51:43,478
Sometimes you have to lose something-

840
00:51:43,562 --> 00:51:46,398
-Before you realize how valuable it is.

841
00:51:48,525 --> 00:51:50,527
Electra Woman comes back.

842
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:52,946
Thanks, Frank.

843
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:55,532
You are like Dr. Oz.

844
00:51:55,616 --> 00:51:58,577
The guy who gives away the hearts and minds?

845
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,579
It's the Wizard of Oz, but almost.

846
00:52:00,662 --> 00:52:02,372
- Just so. - Yes.

847
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:06,502
I will go myself to the crime scene.

848
00:52:06,585 --> 00:52:09,505
- I've also lost things. - Look clues.

849
00:52:09,588 --> 00:52:12,341
I threw out my Frisbee in the forest.

850
00:52:12,424 --> 00:52:15,677
Okay. See what brottoskopet can find about the evil empress.

851
00:52:15,761 --> 00:52:18,013
- I miss him. - Tell me what you find.

852
00:52:18,096 --> 00:52:19,973
- His name was Jonathan. - Thanks, Frank.

853
00:52:20,057 --> 00:52:22,226
Jonathan Frisbee.

854
00:52:33,028 --> 00:52:34,112
Sympathy.

855
00:52:34,196 --> 00:52:35,489
We miss you!

856
00:52:52,381 --> 00:52:55,092
- What's up, Dyna Girl? - Hello.

857
00:52:55,175 --> 00:52:58,679
It's me, Wingman.

858
00:53:02,057 --> 00:53:03,475
I came to say goodbye.

859
00:53:05,686 --> 00:53:09,815
This is from that night he let me look at the three from the closet.

860
00:53:09,898 --> 00:53:12,150
He was a good friend.

861
00:53:17,739 --> 00:53:21,118
Major vaunt and I had a hard time sometimes.

862
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:24,538
Sometimes he took me for granted, or laughed at my idéer-

863
00:53:24,621 --> 00:53:27,207
-or torched my head.

864
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:31,670
Sometimes he did not listen to me when I talked, or ...

865
00:53:31,753 --> 00:53:35,632
I guess I felt that he did not appreciate me.

866
00:53:37,301 --> 00:53:41,263
This is why it is important that we stick together aide ...

867
00:53:41,346 --> 00:53:43,974
- Hey! - Nicely said, Wingman.

868
00:53:44,057 --> 00:53:46,852
Good luck with that.

869
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,479
Nobody likes me.

870
00:54:02,201 --> 00:54:03,243
Dyna Girl?

871
00:54:04,786 --> 00:54:06,205
Can I take a picture?

872
00:54:06,288 --> 00:54:08,916
Sure, absolutely.

873
00:54:08,999 --> 00:54:10,542
Okay.

874
00:54:14,421 --> 00:54:15,797
Me too.

875
00:54:15,881 --> 00:54:19,259
I want to take a picture of me and Dyna Girl.

876
00:54:19,343 --> 00:54:21,470
- Damn it. - What the ...

877
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:23,805
Of course.

878
00:54:29,645 --> 00:54:31,104
Me too.

879
00:54:31,188 --> 00:54:34,608
I want to take a picture of me and Dyna Girl.

880
00:54:34,691 --> 00:54:35,692
Damn it.

881
00:54:39,196 --> 00:54:41,365
My God, Judy.

882
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:43,534
I should have been there.

883
00:54:44,576 --> 00:54:45,619
What am I doing?

884
00:54:45,702 --> 00:54:48,705
You threw a snowball in hell.

885
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:51,083
Now you get to see if it has any chance.

886
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:52,459
Excuse?

887
00:54:52,543 --> 00:54:55,671
Your ego write checks your body can not bail out.

888
00:54:55,754 --> 00:54:58,048
- What? - You're acting like a shit head.

889
00:55:02,427 --> 00:55:04,221
My kids look up to you.

890
00:55:04,304 --> 00:55:07,850
You're a superhero. It's time to act like one.

891
00:55:09,935 --> 00:55:12,396
- Yes. - This is not you.

892
00:55:12,479 --> 00:55:13,772
This is not me.

893
00:55:13,856 --> 00:55:15,649
So go and be yourself.

894
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:19,736
I must go and be myself.

895
00:55:22,322 --> 00:55:24,616
I must go and be myself.

896
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,660
I must go and be myself.

897
00:55:26,743 --> 00:55:27,911
What the hell?

898
00:55:27,995 --> 00:55:29,997
Who looked her in the eye?

899
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:33,500
She's like a wild animal. It's a sign of aggression.

900
00:55:33,584 --> 00:55:36,128
I can not do this, Jack.

901
00:55:36,211 --> 00:55:37,671
I'm a superhero.

902
00:55:37,754 --> 00:55:41,049
It is about time that I behave like one.

903
00:55:42,342 --> 00:55:45,971
I ate kale salad for lunch. Feed me with this kind of crap.

904
00:55:46,054 --> 00:55:48,265
I will, Judy.

905
00:55:48,348 --> 00:55:51,518
If you leave the studio is your reputation destroyed.

906
00:55:51,602 --> 00:55:53,020
Do you understand?

907
00:55:53,103 --> 00:55:54,688
You're finished in this town.

908
00:55:54,771 --> 00:55:57,191
You are finished, Electra. Finished.

909
00:55:57,274 --> 00:56:02,613
No abandons Jack Hurley.

910
00:56:11,914 --> 00:56:14,958
Oh my God. Can not you close the door?

911
00:56:15,042 --> 00:56:17,961
- Go to hell. - Skit Boot.

912
00:56:19,338 --> 00:56:21,423
Talk to me, baby.

913
00:56:21,507 --> 00:56:23,091
I know.

914
00:56:23,175 --> 00:56:25,427
Did you think I did this?

915
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:29,223
What did I say? She will work.

916
00:56:29,306 --> 00:56:33,352
Otherwise, we will force her to cooperate.

917
00:56:33,435 --> 00:56:35,354
So do not worry.

918
00:56:35,437 --> 00:56:36,855
It is her. I have to stop.

919
00:56:36,939 --> 00:56:39,149
Please.

920
00:56:39,233 --> 00:56:40,817
There she is.

921
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:42,653
Dan, she's Judy.

922
00:56:42,736 --> 00:56:47,115
They said it on the news. It is tragic, but I have the solution.

923
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:49,409
You start with MSNBC.

924
00:56:49,493 --> 00:56:52,871
They have a one-hour memorial service for Dyna Girl.

925
00:56:52,955 --> 00:56:56,959
Assuming she dies, as seems likely. I'm sorry for your loss.

926
00:56:57,042 --> 00:56:58,710
Are you kidding?

927
00:56:58,794 --> 00:57:01,964
Judy is gone, and the only thing you think of is the TV?

928
00:57:02,047 --> 00:57:06,718
I think of social media as well. Hashtag "Dyna languishing". Do you understand?

929
00:57:06,802 --> 00:57:08,428
Listen to me, Dan.

930
00:57:08,512 --> 00:57:11,515
I'm done with your media campaign.

931
00:57:11,598 --> 00:57:15,686
They pay well. You should do this interview.

932
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:18,814
You can do the interview itself. I need to find Judy.

933
00:57:19,773 --> 00:57:23,861
Do you know how many heroes who would kill to be in your position?

934
00:57:25,821 --> 00:57:28,073
Hello?

935
00:57:54,099 --> 00:57:55,934
Hello, you loser.

936
00:58:02,858 --> 00:58:05,027
- Frank. - Hej, Electra Woman.

937
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:07,196
Luckily, you do not have a home.

938
00:58:07,279 --> 00:58:10,490
The Empress has kidnapped Judy. I have to save her.

939
00:58:10,574 --> 00:58:13,619
I'll ask brottoskopet track her,

940
00:58:13,702 --> 00:58:16,538
- based on the tracking device in her ElectraCom.

941
00:58:16,622 --> 00:58:18,874
- Can you do it? - Strange.

942
00:58:18,957 --> 00:58:20,792
Yes, it's strange.

943
00:58:20,876 --> 00:58:23,545
You never mentioned this important fact.

944
00:58:23,629 --> 00:58:24,838
- She is here. - What?

945
00:58:24,922 --> 00:58:26,924
According brottoskopet is Dyna Girl here.

946
00:58:27,007 --> 00:58:30,469
It does not add up. You must have read wrong.

947
00:58:30,552 --> 00:58:33,347
Sorry, Frank, I'm just a little upset.

948
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:35,557
I'm not mad at you, but at myself.

949
00:58:35,641 --> 00:58:39,645
I've been a lousy friend to Judy. I asked her to leave.

950
00:58:39,728 --> 00:58:42,814
- Jesus. - I know, I feel awful.

951
00:58:42,898 --> 00:58:46,276
I see Jesus in my orange again. He has a sombrero wearing.

952
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,446
Concentrate, Frank. Where is Dyna Girl?

953
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:52,783
Her current coordinates is here at the agency.

954
00:58:52,866 --> 00:58:56,245
- Are you sure it is not broken? - I do not think so.

955
00:58:56,328 --> 00:58:59,540
How do I get to you? Have the taxi in The Valley?

956
00:58:59,623 --> 00:59:00,958
Use Uber.

957
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:05,254
You have them on your ElectraCom. 20 dollars discount with the code "Frank".

958
00:59:06,171 --> 00:59:08,298
I can not say I'm surprised.

959
00:59:08,382 --> 00:59:10,717
Should I save a divide for you?

960
00:59:10,801 --> 00:59:13,929
- No thanks, Frank. - Okay, more Jesus-orange for me.

961
00:59:16,557 --> 00:59:18,433
Why are you doing this, Bernice?

962
00:59:20,644 --> 00:59:22,521
Supply and demand, you stupid.

963
00:59:23,564 --> 00:59:28,902
All idiots, including you, want to be the hero.

964
00:59:28,986 --> 00:59:32,656
It is so boring.

965
00:59:32,739 --> 00:59:35,826
Why would I want to be one of many hjältar-

966
00:59:35,909 --> 00:59:40,455
- when I can become the only super-villain in the world?

967
00:59:40,539 --> 00:59:42,499
I'm taking over the market.

968
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:46,003
It's basic business economics.

969
00:59:47,379 --> 00:59:50,174
- That paper went well. - Sure did it?

970
00:59:50,257 --> 00:59:52,885
There is no point in discussing it.

971
00:59:52,968 --> 00:59:55,179
The fact is-

972
00:59:55,262 --> 01:00:00,642
- that, against all odds, you have two zeros without krafter-

973
01:00:00,726 --> 01:00:03,896
- has become the most popular super heroes overnight.

974
01:00:03,979 --> 01:00:07,191
It was not overnight. We worked for years ...

975
01:00:07,274 --> 01:00:09,693
Anyway.

976
01:00:09,776 --> 01:00:11,695
I wanted a piece of the pie.

977
01:00:11,778 --> 01:00:13,572
And honestly talat-

978
01:00:13,655 --> 01:00:16,909
-so I deserve it more than you.

979
01:00:17,951 --> 01:00:21,914
Here's a fun fact: "Bernice" rhymes with "fair".

980
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:25,876
Okay, no more fun facts.

981
01:00:34,635 --> 01:00:36,595
It is okay. She's okay.

982
01:00:36,678 --> 01:00:38,263
You guys are friends.

983
01:00:38,347 --> 01:00:40,891
You should go and see her.

984
01:00:40,974 --> 01:00:44,228
The empress will be there. You have to save her.

985
01:00:44,311 --> 01:00:47,898
She will say: "Sorry, what was I thinking of?"

986
01:00:50,317 --> 01:00:52,945
And we are going to hug. Just as in "Full House".

987
01:00:53,028 --> 01:00:58,242
We used to watch the series together. What was I ...

988
01:00:58,325 --> 01:01:00,244
Crikey.

989
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:09,586
I have to CMM, as soon as possible.

990
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:12,214
- Emily, va? - Va? You, Lori.

991
01:01:12,297 --> 01:01:15,342
Sorry, wrong car. I'll get Emily.

992
01:01:15,425 --> 01:01:17,636
For the hell!

993
01:01:19,221 --> 01:01:20,389
You suck, Emily.

994
01:01:20,472 --> 01:01:22,891
I'm just joking. You are certainly nice.

995
01:01:28,313 --> 01:01:31,775
- Hello? - It says that you are here. Where are you?

996
01:01:31,859 --> 01:01:34,111
I'm at the Van Nuys and 7th.

997
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:37,447
I'm not on the 7th. I'm at the Van Nuys and Fenton.

998
01:01:37,531 --> 01:01:40,951
It says that you are on the 7th.

999
01:01:41,034 --> 01:01:43,704
Damn. Okay, stay there.

1000
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:50,711
When did you get your powers, by the way?

1001
01:01:50,794 --> 01:01:53,172
A few months after you have left the city.

1002
01:01:53,255 --> 01:01:55,257
Are you jealous?

1003
01:01:56,842 --> 01:02:01,346
It's a pity you were not there when I found them.

1004
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:05,517
I would have shown what I did to my foster parents.

1005
01:02:05,601 --> 01:02:07,102
Oh my God.

1006
01:02:07,186 --> 01:02:09,146
You really are evil.

1007
01:02:10,397 --> 01:02:13,692
And you are really observant.

1008
01:02:14,693 --> 01:02:17,779
HOPE There may be a little too late for that now.

1009
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,794
Take me to the CMM's offices at Wilshire.

1010
01:02:32,878 --> 01:02:35,297
I have to get there as soon as possible.

1011
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:39,009
Awesome. I'm not an Uber driver. Get out of my car.

1012
01:02:39,092 --> 01:02:43,931
Oh my God. How many black Prius cars are there in this city?

1013
01:02:44,014 --> 01:02:47,309
I has 11 dollars and half a bag of Fritos.

1014
01:02:47,392 --> 01:02:49,061
Out.

1015
01:02:49,144 --> 01:02:50,938
I lied about my Fritos.

1016
01:02:54,483 --> 01:02:56,026
Paul.

1017
01:03:00,489 --> 01:03:02,366
I need my leg!

1018
01:03:07,371 --> 01:03:08,580
- Paul? - Ja. Lori?

1019
01:03:08,664 --> 01:03:10,707
- Yes. - Hey, where are we going?

1020
01:03:10,791 --> 01:03:14,086
- CMM's Office. It is urgent. - Okay.

1021
01:03:14,169 --> 01:03:18,340
Let me write it in my GPS.

1022
01:03:18,423 --> 01:03:20,551
I pressed the "N" button.

1023
01:03:20,634 --> 01:03:21,969
Back.

1024
01:03:22,052 --> 01:03:24,054
The corrected it to "CBS".

1025
01:03:24,137 --> 01:03:26,932
My God, just run.

1026
01:03:27,015 --> 01:03:28,767
Wait. Are you Electra Woman?

1027
01:03:28,851 --> 01:03:31,395
Holy shit. I'm a big fan.

1028
01:03:31,478 --> 01:03:34,982
When you beat the fishermen who smuggled MP3 player in cod ...

1029
01:03:35,065 --> 01:03:36,066
- Paul. - Yes?

1030
01:03:36,149 --> 01:03:40,028
Would you like to be my partner today?

1031
01:03:40,112 --> 01:03:42,030
Yes. Wait, Dyna Girl, then?

1032
01:03:42,114 --> 01:03:44,700
That's the thing. Dyna Girl needs my help.

1033
01:03:44,783 --> 01:03:47,911
She needs our help.

1034
01:03:47,995 --> 01:03:49,580
Can I be Uber Man?

1035
01:03:49,663 --> 01:03:52,791
Honestly, it is not so creative.

1036
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:54,835
And it's probably a protected trademark.

1037
01:03:54,918 --> 01:03:58,213
You will need a lawyer in the long term, but today is fine.

1038
01:03:58,297 --> 01:04:00,090
Pedal to the metal, Uber Man.

1039
01:04:00,174 --> 01:04:02,509
- The Uber-time. - Sure.

1040
01:04:02,593 --> 01:04:04,761
- seat belts. - Okay.

1041
01:04:04,845 --> 01:04:06,388
Put on your belt before you drive.

1042
01:04:06,471 --> 01:04:08,390
Put on your belt order to maintain life.

1043
01:04:08,473 --> 01:04:10,350
Here we go.

1044
01:04:15,898 --> 01:04:18,025
She was right, Paul.

1045
01:04:18,108 --> 01:04:20,569
We did not come here to forget who we are.

1046
01:04:20,652 --> 01:04:24,406
We came here to be the best versions of ourselves.

1047
01:04:24,489 --> 01:04:28,368
I had forgotten that somewhere along the way.

1048
01:04:28,452 --> 01:04:33,624
I do not think I told her how much I appreciate her.

1049
01:04:33,707 --> 01:04:38,253
I did not know how much I appreciated her before she left.

1050
01:04:38,337 --> 01:04:41,131
- Turn left, I need something. - The mission, then?

1051
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:43,217
Left, Uber Man.

1052
01:04:46,136 --> 01:04:48,972
I go downhill between these old ladies.

1053
01:04:49,056 --> 01:04:50,474
That was impressive.

1054
01:04:50,557 --> 01:04:53,519
I am Uber yet. I am Uber tastisk.

1055
01:04:53,602 --> 01:04:55,270
- Okay. - I ...

1056
01:04:55,354 --> 01:04:57,314
- This is the Ub-nation. - Okay.

1057
01:04:57,397 --> 01:05:00,692
I was actually a little excited for a second. And now?

1058
01:05:00,776 --> 01:05:03,320
Ub-baby. Uber...

1059
01:05:03,403 --> 01:05:06,323
- No, stop now. - Shut up, Paul.

1060
01:05:06,406 --> 01:05:09,618
How could I ever have defended you?

1061
01:05:09,701 --> 01:05:11,828
Lori was right.

1062
01:05:11,912 --> 01:05:16,875
The only Lori was right about was that you were a pathetic aides.

1063
01:05:16,959 --> 01:05:19,127
- Did she say that? - Probably.

1064
01:05:19,211 --> 01:05:22,381
It sounds like something she would say.

1065
01:05:22,464 --> 01:05:24,424
I really do not know.

1066
01:05:24,508 --> 01:05:27,511
I guess only that, eftersom-

1067
01:05:27,594 --> 01:05:30,430
- she always thought she was better than you.

1068
01:05:35,727 --> 01:05:36,854
Check this out.

1069
01:05:40,732 --> 01:05:43,485
My brain has become so kraftfull-

1070
01:05:43,569 --> 01:05:47,322
- I can change the molecular structure of my skin

1071
01:05:47,406 --> 01:05:51,243
-to avoid any damage.

1072
01:05:53,787 --> 01:05:56,206
I'm basically invulnerable.

1073
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:58,125
Hashtagg "tack, puberteten".

1074
01:06:02,337 --> 01:06:03,922
But it's no big deal.

1075
01:06:04,006 --> 01:06:09,469
It is all very well for those who do not have any powers.

1076
01:06:11,096 --> 01:06:12,806
Wait, by the way.

1077
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:14,558
Yes, I get it.

1078
01:06:14,641 --> 01:06:16,560
You are powerful.

1079
01:06:16,643 --> 01:06:19,354
It is unfair.

1080
01:06:25,235 --> 01:06:26,445
Hi.

1081
01:06:26,528 --> 01:06:30,115
So if this does not arrange the signal

1082
01:06:30,199 --> 01:06:33,285
- I've been assistant to a number of heroes.

1083
01:06:33,368 --> 01:06:36,079
I would like to take this chance I got.

1084
01:06:36,163 --> 01:06:38,665
If the rescue operation fails.

1085
01:06:38,749 --> 01:06:41,919
And if it succeeds ...

1086
01:06:42,002 --> 01:06:43,629
call me anyway.

1087
01:06:49,009 --> 01:06:50,761
- Okay. - Thanks.

1088
01:06:52,471 --> 01:06:54,139
Paul Kaulkman.

1089
01:06:54,223 --> 01:06:56,099
Make sure to give me five stars.

1090
01:06:57,476 --> 01:06:59,353
Frank.

1091
01:06:59,436 --> 01:07:01,980
Hej, Electra Woman.

1092
01:07:03,607 --> 01:07:07,110
- What can I do for you? - Dyna Girl is gone.

1093
01:07:07,194 --> 01:07:08,529
Just that.

1094
01:07:08,612 --> 01:07:13,075
According brottoskopet she is here, but I do not see her.

1095
01:07:13,158 --> 01:07:14,243
Soup?

1096
01:07:14,326 --> 01:07:16,161
No, Frank.

1097
01:07:17,829 --> 01:07:20,582
What's in the box?

1098
01:07:20,666 --> 01:07:23,085
You have to fix it for me.

1099
01:07:44,106 --> 01:07:45,399
OFF LIMITS

1100
01:07:59,121 --> 01:08:00,664
Jude.

1101
01:08:00,747 --> 01:08:02,708
Lori.

1102
01:08:02,791 --> 01:08:05,502
- Hey, your zero. - Bernice?

1103
01:08:05,586 --> 01:08:07,671
Evil Empress.

1104
01:08:09,756 --> 01:08:10,966
Okay.

1105
01:08:11,842 --> 01:08:15,304
It's nice to see that you are still horrible.

1106
01:08:15,387 --> 01:08:18,640
What are you doing here in the CMM?

1107
01:08:18,724 --> 01:08:21,101
Dan saw something irresistible to me.

1108
01:08:21,185 --> 01:08:24,354
- What? - Yes, he's my agent now.

1109
01:08:24,438 --> 01:08:27,191
Hashtag "blessed".

1110
01:08:29,151 --> 01:08:30,152
Lori.

1111
01:08:41,163 --> 01:08:44,249
Rise and shine.

1112
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:46,960
ZERO

1113
01:08:47,044 --> 01:08:49,087
What mature, Bernice.

1114
01:08:49,171 --> 01:08:50,714
Are you okay?

1115
01:08:50,797 --> 01:08:53,509
- I live. - Currently.

1116
01:08:54,468 --> 01:08:55,886
Looking for something?

1117
01:09:06,563 --> 01:09:10,108
I try not to hate you, but you make it so difficult.

1118
01:09:10,192 --> 01:09:11,902
Not for me. I hate you.

1119
01:09:11,985 --> 01:09:14,404
I do not care what you think about me.

1120
01:09:14,488 --> 01:09:16,156
Why do you do this, Bernice?

1121
01:09:17,074 --> 01:09:19,952
- Can you summarize for her? - Sure.

1122
01:09:20,035 --> 01:09:24,581
Much as I would continue to be impressed by your two-

1123
01:09:24,665 --> 01:09:29,753
- I promised on Reddit to do more evil things today.

1124
01:09:29,837 --> 01:09:33,590
A friendly stranger gave me even gold.

1125
01:09:33,674 --> 01:09:36,009
Although I do not know what that means.

1126
01:09:36,093 --> 01:09:38,971
In addition, Dan would still want me to cause more problems.

1127
01:09:39,054 --> 01:09:43,141
I do not understand dance floor. Why would he want to kill us?

1128
01:09:44,351 --> 01:09:46,436
It was my idea.

1129
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:50,440
Dan has no idea. He laid the schedule just everything.

1130
01:09:50,524 --> 01:09:53,485
I must keep you in prison for a while.

1131
01:09:53,569 --> 01:09:57,281
Getting the public interested to look for you and rescue you.

1132
01:09:57,364 --> 01:09:59,157
And then...

1133
01:10:14,548 --> 01:10:17,050
I'm so sorry, Jude.

1134
01:10:17,134 --> 01:10:20,596
Do not worry. We said things, both.

1135
01:10:20,679 --> 01:10:24,892
And the truth is that we were both distracted by our egos.

1136
01:10:24,975 --> 01:10:28,937
We relied too much on our own definitions of right and error

1137
01:10:29,021 --> 01:10:31,273
-and assumed that our opinions were facts.

1138
01:10:31,356 --> 01:10:37,279
We forgot the important thing with respect, patience, humility ...

1139
01:10:37,362 --> 01:10:39,364
Lori? Lori.

1140
01:10:39,448 --> 01:10:41,658
Interrupts me with a false coma?

1141
01:10:41,742 --> 01:10:45,704
"Interrupting Koman 'is a classic. I have not used it in a long time.

1142
01:10:45,787 --> 01:10:49,166
- Sure, you do not like my speech. - No.

1143
01:10:49,249 --> 01:10:51,543
I like your voice.

1144
01:10:51,627 --> 01:10:53,795
And it was great.

1145
01:10:53,879 --> 01:10:55,464
It is sincerely to you.

1146
01:10:55,547 --> 01:10:57,549
It's very honest.

1147
01:10:57,633 --> 01:10:59,301
And super boring.

1148
01:10:59,384 --> 01:11:00,511
Tack.

1149
01:11:10,687 --> 01:11:11,688
Frank.

1150
01:11:13,982 --> 01:11:16,652
Hej, Dyna Girl.

1151
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:18,195
Zero.

1152
01:11:18,278 --> 01:11:21,907
- What are you doing down here? - I keep soup down here.

1153
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:24,785
- What are you doing down here? - The Empress?

1154
01:11:24,868 --> 01:11:27,955
Judy was kidnapped. I came to look for her.

1155
01:11:28,038 --> 01:11:31,542
Did not you notice that I never came back from the corridor?

1156
01:11:31,625 --> 01:11:36,129
Right. I'm glad you found her.

1157
01:11:36,213 --> 01:11:38,423
Excellent job, as usual.

1158
01:11:38,507 --> 01:11:41,885
- Have fun. - Free us, Frank.

1159
01:11:41,969 --> 01:11:46,181
- We have to jump into our costumes. - You're welcome.

1160
01:11:46,265 --> 01:11:50,227
I said "jump", not "soup".

1161
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:53,146
Okay. They sound very similar.

1162
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:56,024
- Is that the minestrone? - You bet.

1163
01:12:25,637 --> 01:12:27,806
So...

1164
01:12:29,558 --> 01:12:32,644
What is our plan anyway?

1165
01:12:32,728 --> 01:12:34,646
Oh, I ...

1166
01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:37,691
There I almost forgot. It is finished.

1167
01:13:03,634 --> 01:13:05,677
There are Electra Woman and Dyna Girl.

1168
01:13:05,761 --> 01:13:07,429
And Electra-car.

1169
01:13:52,933 --> 01:13:54,351
You?

1170
01:13:55,727 --> 01:13:56,895
All of the work.

1171
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:01,859
Damn it.

1172
01:14:01,942 --> 01:14:05,404
We waited the whole program with the show car. Was that all?

1173
01:14:05,487 --> 01:14:06,989
We saw at least cool off.

1174
01:14:07,072 --> 01:14:08,490
- Really? - Yes.

1175
01:14:08,574 --> 01:14:12,494
It's true. You looked cool when you stood in front of it.

1176
01:14:12,578 --> 01:14:14,329
I agree with.

1177
01:14:14,413 --> 01:14:19,668
It would have been nice to see a bit more from the car. I enjoyed our time together.

1178
01:14:19,751 --> 01:14:23,964
No ElectraCom, no Electra-car. We sit at the Electra-glued.

1179
01:14:24,047 --> 01:14:28,135
We never had that stuff before. We were superheroes anyway, right?

1180
01:14:28,218 --> 01:14:29,678
Just that.

1181
01:14:30,554 --> 01:14:34,975
The Empress, do you remember when I said I was not beat children? I lied.

1182
01:14:35,058 --> 01:14:39,229
And I have not said anything about the subject until now.

1183
01:14:52,659 --> 01:14:55,078
Yes, take her.

1184
01:14:55,162 --> 01:14:58,373
So it should look like.

1185
01:14:58,457 --> 01:15:00,751
- Let me do this. - Okay.

1186
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:09,426
She's not hurt.

1187
01:15:11,762 --> 01:15:14,848
I do not think it works.

1188
01:15:17,559 --> 01:15:19,520
Cute, guys.

1189
01:15:19,603 --> 01:15:23,899
We're a little early, but Dan certainly have nothing against it.

1190
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:33,033
Electra Woman.

1191
01:15:47,089 --> 01:15:51,969
It seems that the world will see when you can not save your helpers.

1192
01:15:52,052 --> 01:15:53,428
She's not my sidekick.

1193
01:15:54,930 --> 01:15:58,517
She is my partner. There, she will always be.

1194
01:15:59,685 --> 01:16:04,064
Just like you always only going to be Bernice.

1195
01:16:04,147 --> 01:16:06,483
Our annoying, lousy neighbor ...

1196
01:16:09,236 --> 01:16:10,946
peanut allergy.

1197
01:16:26,086 --> 01:16:28,755
What do you think of your impermeable skin?

1198
01:16:28,839 --> 01:16:30,007
Damn it.

1199
01:16:45,981 --> 01:16:47,316
This was unexpected.

1200
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:49,860
- Did you know this would happen? - No.

1201
01:16:57,075 --> 01:16:59,745
What have you done?

1202
01:16:59,828 --> 01:17:01,663
Oh my God.

1203
01:17:01,747 --> 01:17:02,998
I can not look away.

1204
01:17:09,796 --> 01:17:13,509
Where are you going, your zeroes?

1205
01:17:13,592 --> 01:17:15,177
This is not over.

1206
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:16,428
I ...

1207
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:45,916
I am grateful that you have stopped her.

1208
01:17:45,999 --> 01:17:48,961
But there were bloodier than necessary.

1209
01:17:49,044 --> 01:17:53,674
I agree with. Well done, but disgusting.

1210
01:17:53,757 --> 01:17:55,884
- Yes, definitely. - I agree with.

1211
01:17:55,968 --> 01:17:59,513
I guess we need to find Dan now.

1212
01:17:59,596 --> 01:18:01,849
- Do you know what would help? - What then?

1213
01:18:03,058 --> 01:18:05,644
Oh my God. Fixed to the Dyna-hungry?

1214
01:18:05,727 --> 01:18:07,020
Perhaps.

1215
01:18:07,104 --> 01:18:09,690
Our old equipment was not so bad.

1216
01:18:09,773 --> 01:18:12,192
As I said. We are classic.

1217
01:18:12,276 --> 01:18:14,403
We did not change.

1218
01:18:17,447 --> 01:18:20,117
I appreciate that you did this.

1219
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:23,579
But we could not have used this a few minutes ago?

1220
01:18:23,662 --> 01:18:27,082
When it looked like we were going to be defeated?

1221
01:18:27,165 --> 01:18:28,876
Sure, we could have done.

1222
01:18:28,959 --> 01:18:32,546
I thought you should have it at the end, thematically speaking.

1223
01:18:32,629 --> 01:18:35,591
The tie a nice bow on our common journey.

1224
01:18:35,674 --> 01:18:38,760
I understand why you risked our lives for it.

1225
01:18:38,844 --> 01:18:40,637
I'm a sucker for stories.

1226
01:18:40,721 --> 01:18:44,474
So what should we do with Dan? He tried to kill us.

1227
01:18:44,558 --> 01:18:47,978
True, but see it like this-

1228
01:18:48,061 --> 01:18:51,440
- is this really the worst thing an agent has done to a client?

1229
01:18:51,523 --> 01:18:52,774
Good point.

1230
01:18:52,858 --> 01:18:55,360
I could use a little holiday.

1231
01:18:55,444 --> 01:18:59,072
We go to Canada. They are said to have great tax benefits.

1232
01:18:59,156 --> 01:19:01,074
That's the spirit.

1233
