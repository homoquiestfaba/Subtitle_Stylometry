00:00:29,704 --> 00:00:33,406
[Voiceover] Everything
is based in symbiosis.

3
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,309
Givers and takers.

4
00:00:36,677 --> 00:00:41,715
God gave us life but then
he took it away with death.

5
00:00:42,951 --> 00:00:47,519
But now God doesn't exist anymore so...

6
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:50,824
someone's gotta step up to the plate.

00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,263

10
00:03:01,656 --> 00:03:03,322
Come on, it'll be fun.

11
00:03:03,324 --> 00:03:04,723
Nope.

12
00:03:04,725 --> 00:03:06,826
Sounds like the plot of a lame movie.

13
00:03:06,828 --> 00:03:09,995
"What happens when a guy names
Ned takes a hooker named Love

14
00:03:09,997 --> 00:03:12,330
"home to meet the parents?

15
00:03:12,332 --> 00:03:14,167
"This Thanksgiving the turkey ain't all

16
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:16,369
"that's getting stuffed."

17
00:03:16,371 --> 00:03:17,870
You're not a hooker.

18
00:03:17,872 --> 00:03:20,205
And strippers are really dancers.

19
00:03:20,207 --> 00:03:22,774
By now my family probably thinks I'm gay.

20
00:03:22,776 --> 00:03:25,578
Well them thinking it doesn't
put a cock in your ass now,

21
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,814
does it?

22
00:03:27,816 --> 00:03:29,482
No it doesn't.

23
00:03:29,484 --> 00:03:33,219
But you gotta admit, we're
getting pretty serious.

24
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:34,519
You're just a regular.

25
00:03:34,521 --> 00:03:35,887
You don't charge me.

26
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:39,758
I don't charge you
because you pay me anyway.

27
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,161
Love, I love you.

28
00:03:43,163 --> 00:03:45,430
And I you, like a brother.

29
00:03:45,432 --> 00:03:48,034
Like a brother than I fuck.

30
00:03:58,246 --> 00:04:00,812
You know I'm only joking right?

31
00:04:00,814 --> 00:04:02,482
I know.

32
00:04:02,484 --> 00:04:04,049
That's what I love about you.

33
00:04:04,051 --> 00:04:07,455
I wanna joke with you every day like this.

34
00:04:09,424 --> 00:04:12,324
All right, I know enough
about how I feel about you,

35
00:04:12,326 --> 00:04:16,428
to know that this is it.

36
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,331
(Love sighs)

37
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,868
It's what I now about
me that counts though.

38
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,303
I've got to feel worth it.

39
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:27,673

(ominous music) (choking)

41
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,553
You beg for life.

42
00:05:13,555 --> 00:05:16,891
"Let me live! Let me live!"

43
00:05:17,992 --> 00:05:22,461
But day by day you feed on distraction.

44
00:05:22,463 --> 00:05:24,832
Prove me wrong.

45
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:29,437
Life is not just existence.

46
00:05:33,408 --> 00:05:36,308
Which is more important?

47
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,277
How we got here?

48
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:42,647
What we're doing here?

49
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:45,886
Or where we go when we leave?

50
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,423
How'd you get here?

51
00:05:51,425 --> 00:05:54,896
(dark rockabilly music)

52
00:05:56,463 --> 00:05:58,630
You've been a naughty
little prince, haven't you?

53
00:05:58,632 --> 00:06:01,466
Yes you have.

54
00:06:01,468 --> 00:06:05,071
Knocked over Daddy's little Colt.

55
00:06:06,107 --> 00:06:07,807
Look at her.

56
00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:09,942
Look at her, cleaning your naughty.

57
00:06:09,944 --> 00:06:13,147
This isn't doing any
good. It's all soaked in.

58
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:19,386
Oh, we're surrounded by quitters today.

59
00:06:21,488 --> 00:06:25,091
Mm, there she is. There's my girl.

60
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,425
Ready to party?

61
00:06:27,427 --> 00:06:30,762
Yeah, Sonny can I talk to you?

62
00:06:30,764 --> 00:06:33,531
[Sonny] We got a party tonight.

63
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:35,000
Can we talk alone?

64
00:06:35,002 --> 00:06:38,003
Why? She won't say nothing.

65
00:06:38,005 --> 00:06:40,072
Not too bright.

66
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:42,007
Fine.

67
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:43,743
I made up my mind.

68
00:06:43,745 --> 00:06:45,043
I'm ready to move on.

69
00:06:45,045 --> 00:06:47,012
Move on?

70
00:06:47,014 --> 00:06:48,481
The next level?

71
00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:51,317
So, drugs? Do hits? Fucking donkey shows?

72
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,218
(chuckles)

73
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,387
What you got in mind?

74
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:56,154
I don't wanna work anymore.

75
00:06:56,156 --> 00:06:59,959
Please, I got enough lazy bitches to feed.

76
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,526
I'm quiting.

77
00:07:01,528 --> 00:07:03,262
No more parties.

78
00:07:03,264 --> 00:07:06,332
No, you're going out tonight.

79
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:08,800
Don't set up a gig and
got to come through one.

80
00:07:08,802 --> 00:07:11,803
New girl's going with ya.

81
00:07:11,805 --> 00:07:15,473
You're not getting me to work with kids.

82
00:07:15,475 --> 00:07:19,010
Not Tabby. I'm just baby sitting.

83
00:07:19,012 --> 00:07:20,445
Besides, silly bitch done give everything

84
00:07:20,447 --> 00:07:21,981
away for free anyway.

85
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,884
Look, I'm telling you I quit.

86
00:07:24,886 --> 00:07:27,553
Women...

87
00:07:27,555 --> 00:07:31,123
I knew I should have invested in trannies.

88
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,291
Sit down!

89
00:07:33,293 --> 00:07:35,695
Floor's full of bugs and Fritos.

90
00:07:35,697 --> 00:07:38,363
And you'll eat off it if I tell you to.

91
00:07:38,365 --> 00:07:39,498
Not likely.

92
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,767
You knew from day one you wouldn't

93
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:43,502
be able to walk away from this.

94
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,570
Made it all clear.

95
00:07:44,572 --> 00:07:46,805
You're in, you're in.

96
00:07:46,807 --> 00:07:49,474
Nothing lasts forever.

97
00:07:49,476 --> 00:07:52,310
I could twist your fucking head right now.

98
00:07:52,312 --> 00:07:53,546
You seen it all.

99
00:07:53,548 --> 00:07:57,783
Loose ends ain't how business works.

100
00:07:57,785 --> 00:07:59,618
Things are different for me.

101
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,887
You know if you let me go I'm down.

102
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:03,255
I won't say shit to anyone.

103
00:08:03,257 --> 00:08:05,591
I've earned my pass.

104
00:08:05,593 --> 00:08:08,793
You leave me hanging and
I'll leave you hanging

105
00:08:08,795 --> 00:08:10,829
by your neck.

106
00:08:10,831 --> 00:08:14,501
Now, you got a party to go to.

107
00:08:16,137 --> 00:08:20,074
One job, it's the last
one and then I'm out.

108
00:08:25,346 --> 00:08:26,611
Whatever you say.

109
00:08:26,613 --> 00:08:28,279
I'm serious.

110
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:30,216
(gasping)

111
00:08:31,285 --> 00:08:34,853
Be sure to spread them extra wide tonight.

112
00:08:34,855 --> 00:08:37,657
Take in as much as possible.

113
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:43,728
Where am I going?

114
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,165
Poot's getting the other girls.

115
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:47,532
They'll pick ya up.

116
00:08:47,534 --> 00:08:50,603
(rock music)

117
00:08:52,807 --> 00:08:54,375
Love!

118
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:58,743
You look lovely!

119
00:08:58,745 --> 00:09:00,045
Poot, you're looking like a grown man

120
00:09:00,047 --> 00:09:01,881
that likes to be called Poot.

121
00:09:01,883 --> 00:09:04,449
Hey, meet the girls.

122
00:09:04,451 --> 00:09:08,853
This is Halley, like the comet.

123
00:09:08,855 --> 00:09:12,760
And this is Jenna.

124
00:09:18,198 --> 00:09:21,800
All right, well why don't
you guys get acquainted,

125
00:09:21,802 --> 00:09:24,969
I am gonna smoke a J
and we'll be on the way.

126
00:09:24,971 --> 00:09:26,738
Why don't we just leave?

127
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,940
Got plenty of time.

128
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,209
I figure they're gonna have you ladies do

129
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:33,244
one of those
cheek-to-cheek dildo things.

130
00:09:33,246 --> 00:09:36,382
You know, I figure you might
wanna feel each other up or,

131
00:09:36,384 --> 00:09:37,483
oops did I say that?

132
00:09:37,485 --> 00:09:40,419
I meant feel each other out.

133
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:42,253
What's a cheek to cheek?

134
00:09:42,255 --> 00:09:45,593
It's like A Requiem for a Dream.

135
00:09:47,528 --> 00:09:49,127
I don't know what the shit you just said.

136
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:50,463
It's a gross movie.

137
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:51,464
Scared me.

138
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,665
See, we know each other.

139
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:54,300
Hailey's the movie critic and Jenna...

140
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,233
The actress.

141
00:09:55,235 --> 00:09:56,401
You may have seen me on MySpace,

142
00:09:56,403 --> 00:09:59,473
like a thousand-hundred friends.

143
00:10:00,607 --> 00:10:03,108
Can we just get this
thing over and done with?

144
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,210
Damn girl, you horny or what?

145
00:10:05,212 --> 00:10:07,781
Very or what.

146
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,484
All right!

147
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:15,689
Cram in, we'll roll.

148
00:10:16,857 --> 00:10:19,657
Oh, sexy leprechaun.

149
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:23,062
"They're always after me Lucky Charms!"

150
00:11:00,902 --> 00:11:02,468
It's the vacation home.

151
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,435
Anytime is perfect.

152
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:06,070
I'm putting the keys in the box right now.

153
00:11:06,072 --> 00:11:08,273
You should bring your clients by tomorrow.

154
00:11:08,275 --> 00:11:09,574
Well next week then.

155
00:11:09,576 --> 00:11:10,776
Sell it for me Ricky.

156
00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:13,512
I've got a 900 channel cable bill to pay.

157
00:11:13,514 --> 00:11:15,915
(ominous music)

158
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:18,919
Excuse me, are you...

159
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,720
I didn't see another car in the driveway.

160
00:11:22,722 --> 00:11:25,492
Were you looking at the house?

161
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,672
(screaming)

162
00:11:40,674 --> 00:11:44,577
(peaceful music)

163
00:11:47,847 --> 00:11:49,614
[Ned] Am I calling at a bad time?

164
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:51,083
I just don't wanna bug you.

165
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,651
[Love] If you bug me
you'll be the first to know.

166
00:11:53,653 --> 00:11:55,153
All right, I just don't wanna smother you.

167
00:11:55,155 --> 00:11:57,189
You know, people like people
and the next thing you know

168
00:11:57,191 --> 00:11:59,724
the word stalker's being thrown around.

169
00:11:59,726 --> 00:12:02,194
Sounds like you have a past
I'm needing to know about?

170
00:12:02,196 --> 00:12:03,796
[Ned] Oh, nothing deeper than a nerd who,

171
00:12:03,798 --> 00:12:07,432
when the girls said jump he'd jump.

172
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:08,901
Right off a cliff.

173
00:12:08,903 --> 00:12:10,469
I've got one last thing to do tonight

174
00:12:10,471 --> 00:12:12,338
and then we'll talk, okay?

175
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,738
What do you want to talk about?

176
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,541
Our world.

177
00:12:17,544 --> 00:12:19,511
Okay, what time are you picking us back up?

178
00:12:19,513 --> 00:12:22,214
[Poot] That is on a
need-to-know basis.

179
00:12:22,216 --> 00:12:23,715
Figures.

180
00:12:23,717 --> 00:12:27,219
[Poot] Hey, Sonny is dealing
with evil shit all day long.

181
00:12:27,221 --> 00:12:29,220
He doesn't have time for me to bug him

182
00:12:29,222 --> 00:12:30,789
with every last detail.

183
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:34,727
Yeah, well I'm glad our
well-being is a little detail.

184
00:12:54,548 --> 00:12:56,949
[Ned] Why don't I just
come get you right now?

185
00:12:56,951 --> 00:12:58,316
People need to know
they can save themselves

186
00:12:58,318 --> 00:13:01,487
before they let others protect them.

187
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,820
All right, well whatever it is you

188
00:13:02,822 --> 00:13:05,056
have to prove or do I respect that

189
00:13:05,058 --> 00:13:09,060
but I'd rather you drop it
and come hang out with me.

190
00:13:09,062 --> 00:13:11,863
There are many things
I wanna say to you, Ned.

191
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:16,734
Wonderful happy things but
they're not for the phone

192
00:13:16,736 --> 00:13:20,772
and they're definitely not for right now.

193
00:13:20,774 --> 00:13:21,940
[Ned] All right, well if
you need me I'll be there

194
00:13:21,942 --> 00:13:23,608
in a flash.

195
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,880
[Love] I'll call you tonight, I promise.

196
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,748
I love you.

197
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,720
And you're the only
person I make promises to.

198
00:13:40,427 --> 00:13:42,560
(tense music)

199
00:13:42,562 --> 00:13:46,598
You could have made different
choices, do you agree?

200
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,233
No, you don't.

201
00:13:49,235 --> 00:13:53,473
You are just a dumb-eyed, drooling victim.

202
00:13:54,575 --> 00:13:58,276
People don't plan to
die but when they do they

203
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:00,848
just lie down for it.

204
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:06,319
People don't have freedom of choice.

205
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,824
Only choice you can make
depends upon your options.

206
00:14:12,692 --> 00:14:16,162
So outside influences direct the outcome.

207
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:22,001
People don't have the power of free will...

208
00:14:23,837 --> 00:14:25,671
but they do have the power to direct

209
00:14:25,673 --> 00:14:28,141
the free will of others.

210
00:14:29,476 --> 00:14:31,244
Ripples.

211
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:34,447
Ripples...

212
00:14:35,582 --> 00:14:38,618
in a pond of chaos.

213
00:14:44,191 --> 00:14:45,826
Take it.

214
00:14:47,961 --> 00:14:49,862
Take it.

215
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,069
Now...

216
00:14:59,506 --> 00:15:01,672
what are you doing here?

217
00:15:01,674 --> 00:15:05,111
(ominous music)

218
00:15:08,182 --> 00:15:09,680
What are your names?

219
00:15:09,682 --> 00:15:11,049
Jenna.

220
00:15:11,051 --> 00:15:12,350
Halley.

221
00:15:12,352 --> 00:15:14,051
Scarlet.

222
00:15:14,053 --> 00:15:16,456
Your real names.

223
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,090
Sasha.

224
00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:20,960
Angel.

225
00:15:22,363 --> 00:15:23,594
Barbara.

226
00:15:23,596 --> 00:15:25,833
They've had some training.

227
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:29,600
Sucks when you have to do rentals.

228
00:15:29,602 --> 00:15:31,570
Should look into
rent-to-own, baby.

229
00:15:31,572 --> 00:15:33,305
I'm Cleb!

230
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,807
(Jenna giggles)

231
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,277
I'm Mistress Selma.

232
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:44,283
So, the ice is broken...

233
00:15:45,552 --> 00:15:48,119
and we've all fallen through.

234
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:50,857
Well let's warm things up then.

235
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,027
Well my name's Hate.

236
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:58,629
Is that warm enough for you?

237
00:15:58,631 --> 00:16:00,932
(Selma giggles)

238
00:16:00,934 --> 00:16:03,535
So, you're successful.

239
00:16:03,537 --> 00:16:04,972
Mm-hm.

240
00:16:06,606 --> 00:16:08,406
Good looking.

241
00:16:08,408 --> 00:16:09,141
Yeah.

242
00:16:09,143 --> 00:16:11,008
Why escorts?

243
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,844
Just you.

244
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,914
Escort, no plural.

245
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:19,685
I don't know, girls, I don't
wanna say they're needy,

246
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,118
but wanty.

247
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,887
As opposed to guys?

248
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:27,693
Well I only swing one way
so it's a one-sided view.

249
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:31,028
So look, a lot of women are smart enough

250
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,965
to get what they need but they make men

251
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:37,636
bend over backwards for
stupid shit they want like,

252
00:16:37,638 --> 00:16:42,109
cars and clothes.

253
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:48,180
Well, women are more materialistic.

254
00:16:48,182 --> 00:16:52,283
You know, no picking
flowers, just store-bought?

255
00:16:52,285 --> 00:16:56,021
That and talking on cell phones 24/7.

256
00:16:56,023 --> 00:17:00,025
Oh and they meet a guy
who's a wannabe rocker,

257
00:17:00,027 --> 00:17:03,628
plays a little guitar, they're gone.

258
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:07,565
Okay, so does it bother
you when girls say that

259
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:10,869
most of her friends are men?

260
00:17:10,871 --> 00:17:14,206
Oh, yeah that's who
they're talking to right?

261
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,674
I mean anyone that's serious about someone,

262
00:17:16,676 --> 00:17:19,378
if you're spending more
time with another boy

263
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,978
they're gonna get mad.

264
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:24,115
I mean, it's not jealousy
it's just common sense.

265
00:17:24,117 --> 00:17:26,218
And these are all younger women, right?

266
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,220
Come on, don't be coy.

267
00:17:29,222 --> 00:17:31,355
Men mature a lot slower than women.

268
00:17:31,357 --> 00:17:34,058
It's that whole dawn of the manchild thing.

269
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,361
Well women fuck you
over when they're younger

270
00:17:36,363 --> 00:17:40,032
because when you get older
you're gonna fuck them over.

271
00:17:40,034 --> 00:17:41,400
I know where you're going
with this and it's bullshit.

272
00:17:41,402 --> 00:17:42,601
- [Love] Do you?
- [Ned] Yeah.

273
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,635
Women put most the pressure on themselves.

274
00:17:44,637 --> 00:17:46,537
I mean, walking around all annoying,

275
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:49,040
"I'm fat, oh I need Botox."

276
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:51,509
Oh, come on!

277
00:17:51,511 --> 00:17:52,944
Bullshit!

278
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,447
The moment a girl doesn't
look like a bikini model

279
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,015
the man starts chasing tail.

280
00:17:57,017 --> 00:17:59,985
Take your average woman
and your poor sap guy

281
00:17:59,987 --> 00:18:02,520
and when they get older he is going to dump

282
00:18:02,522 --> 00:18:04,957
her ass to fuck escorts.

283
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,391
I know.

284
00:18:06,393 --> 00:18:08,293
Well if they've been together
long enough he probably

285
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,495
won't have enough money to fuck escorts.

286
00:18:10,497 --> 00:18:11,763
(Love laughs)

287
00:18:11,765 --> 00:18:12,730
Oh, you've just been burnt by some bitches.

288
00:18:12,732 --> 00:18:14,565
Don't lump us all into one.

289
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:16,000
Are we fighting?

290
00:18:16,002 --> 00:18:18,236
I was thinking I was gonna
hit you with this pillow.

291
00:18:18,238 --> 00:18:21,506
No, I think that I am going to

292
00:18:21,508 --> 00:18:25,776
tiger shuck your arm, (Love giggling)

293
00:18:25,778 --> 00:18:28,779
pull it down here and tickle you to death.

294
00:18:28,781 --> 00:18:31,449
Oh, I think you'll regret that.

295
00:18:31,451 --> 00:18:34,954
Okay, oh mercy! Mercy, mercy.

296
00:18:37,023 --> 00:18:39,423
See, you peed a little bit.

297
00:18:39,425 --> 00:18:41,261
Shut up.

298
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:45,564
Seriously though.

299
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:47,332
What?

300
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:51,769
If that's what bothers you
about girls, why escorts?

301
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:53,572
Just you.

302
00:18:53,574 --> 00:18:55,740
I figured I'd know what
I was getting myself into

303
00:18:55,742 --> 00:18:58,276
beforehand with you.

304
00:18:58,278 --> 00:19:00,245
Now what do you think?

305
00:19:00,247 --> 00:19:04,649
I think you're worth
learning to play guitar for?

306
00:19:04,651 --> 00:19:06,117
Banjo?

307
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:08,519
Stick to flower picking.

308
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:12,224
Dandelions, they'd be my favorite.

309
00:19:32,011 --> 00:19:33,812
Is your name really Hate?

310
00:19:33,814 --> 00:19:36,414
Well, my parents didn't get along so well.

311
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,450
I think it's a sexy name.

312
00:19:39,452 --> 00:19:42,421
Bit dramatic.

313
00:19:42,423 --> 00:19:44,823
Or simple.

314
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:46,224
I'm a simple guy.

315
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,026
My name's short for Clebidiah.

316
00:19:48,028 --> 00:19:50,094
That's unique.

317
00:19:50,096 --> 00:19:52,564
I thought we were gonna party.

318
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,066
Yeah my hosting skills are a bit rusty.

319
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,701
We're not "people" people.

320
00:19:57,703 --> 00:19:59,703
Okay.

321
00:19:59,705 --> 00:20:01,440
I'm gonna get drinks.

322
00:20:01,442 --> 00:20:03,240
Is there any booze in this house?

323
00:20:03,242 --> 00:20:06,510
No, sit back down.

324
00:20:06,512 --> 00:20:08,748
Cleb will get it.

325
00:20:12,752 --> 00:20:14,553
Cleb.

326
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:23,562
So, what do you guys do?

327
00:20:23,564 --> 00:20:27,498
Ordering a three-girl takeout
must be a special occasion.

328
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,366
We are actors.

329
00:20:29,368 --> 00:20:30,669
(Selma and Jenna laughing)

330
00:20:30,671 --> 00:20:34,439
Yeah, we're in a play. Rave reviews.

331
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,173
Anything I've heard of?

332
00:20:36,175 --> 00:20:37,609
Three Mad Mice.

333
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,313
Do you have a MySpace?

334
00:20:41,582 --> 00:20:44,248
[Halley] So, you guys do movies?

335
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,884
Film is not my medium of choice.

336
00:20:46,886 --> 00:20:50,488
I suppose the art has its value.

337
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,624
I prefer to use my mind.

338
00:20:53,626 --> 00:20:57,562
I bet there's a lot of dirty
things going on up there.

339
00:20:57,564 --> 00:21:00,332
Can you explain that?

340
00:21:00,334 --> 00:21:03,937
What you just said about your mind.

341
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:10,342
Use my mind as a projector.

342
00:21:10,344 --> 00:21:13,978
To put Hate out into the world.

343
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,180
[Jenna] That's so hot.

344
00:21:15,182 --> 00:21:17,951
First call for alcohol!

345
00:21:25,692 --> 00:21:27,793
Thank you.

346
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:42,440
"And that," said the
snail "is the slick of it."

347
00:21:42,442 --> 00:21:44,810
(girls laughing) Get it, huh?

348
00:21:45,979 --> 00:21:48,315
Slick of it.

349
00:21:51,218 --> 00:21:53,384
That's dumb.

350
00:21:53,386 --> 00:21:57,389
Bless the power of beer
to bring us all together.

351
00:21:57,391 --> 00:21:59,924
One beer to rule them all.

352
00:21:59,926 --> 00:22:02,994
Yeah but what kind of party
can you have with a 24-pack?

353
00:22:02,996 --> 00:22:05,699
Have mine.

354
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,835
Haven't touched it.

355
00:22:10,103 --> 00:22:11,268
Thank you.

356
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,337
Mm, I guess now we see who's all more

357
00:22:13,339 --> 00:22:15,574
bearable as a drunk.

358
00:22:15,576 --> 00:22:18,442
I can't even get a buzz
off six beers, come on.

359
00:22:18,444 --> 00:22:21,912
There's mutual desires in compatibility.

360
00:22:21,914 --> 00:22:23,113
Not the beer.

361
00:22:23,115 --> 00:22:24,882
On a basic human level the beer brings out

362
00:22:24,884 --> 00:22:26,183
our compatibility.

363
00:22:26,185 --> 00:22:30,521
I doubt anyone has the
same desires as Cleb.

364
00:22:30,523 --> 00:22:33,857
You all laughed at the stupid snail joke.

365
00:22:33,859 --> 00:22:35,994
It's lack of humor should indicate to you

366
00:22:35,996 --> 00:22:38,529
our mutual desire to get along

367
00:22:38,531 --> 00:22:41,132
regardless of motivation.

368
00:22:41,134 --> 00:22:45,135
Beer makes us laugh at
all sorts of stupid things.

369
00:22:45,137 --> 00:22:46,270
You weren't drinking.

370
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:49,673
You weren't laughing.

371
00:22:49,675 --> 00:22:52,509
In this scenario,

372
00:22:52,511 --> 00:22:56,314
this basic human level you speak of,

373
00:22:56,316 --> 00:23:00,017
it's Tab A into Slot B for money.

374
00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:02,653
We all signed on without a drink.

375
00:23:02,655 --> 00:23:06,591
I don't know what the fuck
y'all are talking about.

376
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,759
Does somebody have another joke?

377
00:23:08,761 --> 00:23:11,863
Yeah, tell us a joke.

378
00:23:11,865 --> 00:23:15,499
I don't usually carry any around, sorry.

379
00:23:15,501 --> 00:23:17,469
You got one or two.

380
00:23:17,471 --> 00:23:21,905
Nothing intellectual enough
for you I don't think.

381
00:23:21,907 --> 00:23:25,343
Cleb and I probably memorized
the same books as kids.

382
00:23:25,345 --> 00:23:29,648
Boy, I bet you can hold your own.

383
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,851
You're not as simple as you said you were.

384
00:23:32,853 --> 00:23:34,286
I just like to keep my eyes open.

385
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:35,653
Now tell us a joke.

386
00:23:35,655 --> 00:23:37,455
Make it a funny one.

387
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,159
Okay.

388
00:23:41,228 --> 00:23:43,661
Two snowmen are walking in a meadow.

389
00:23:43,663 --> 00:23:47,532
The first snowman says
to the second snowman,

390
00:23:47,534 --> 00:23:50,203
"Do you smell carrots?"

391
00:23:54,007 --> 00:23:58,011
(Hate and Love giggle)

392
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:04,949
[Halley] I don't get it.

393
00:24:04,951 --> 00:24:06,851
Snowmen can't walk.

394
00:24:06,853 --> 00:24:08,519
Snails can't talk either.

395
00:24:08,521 --> 00:24:10,988
All living creatures use
some means of communication.

396
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,590
Just becuase we can't understand them

397
00:24:12,592 --> 00:24:14,459
doesn't mean snails can't talk.

398
00:24:14,461 --> 00:24:18,632
Whereas snowmen are
innanimate lifeless entities.

399
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,900
[Hate] Very good, Cleb.

400
00:24:21,902 --> 00:24:26,237
Every retard has its moment I guess.

401
00:24:26,239 --> 00:24:29,140
See, they don't get along.

402
00:24:29,142 --> 00:24:31,543
Oh, they know each other
so that doesn't count.

403
00:24:31,545 --> 00:24:34,345
Ah, so it's all healthy?

404
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,081
We've bonded.

405
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:38,652
Right.

406
00:24:40,487 --> 00:24:42,754
Yeah, I think it's time
we divided up and got down

407
00:24:42,756 --> 00:24:44,588
to business.

408
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,591
[Halley] Got my victim.

409
00:24:46,593 --> 00:24:50,260
I would appreciate it
if you were to accompany

410
00:24:50,262 --> 00:24:54,565
me this evening.

411
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:57,067
Hey, I've been batting
eylashes at you all night.

412
00:24:57,069 --> 00:24:59,271
You'll have fun with Cleb.

413
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:03,607
One-on-one
time!

414
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:07,046
We're not playing love connection.

415
00:25:08,248 --> 00:25:10,315
You gotta play it to win it.

416
00:25:10,317 --> 00:25:13,117
I paid for all the prizes.

417
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:16,086
Then I guess you want the best.

418
00:25:16,088 --> 00:25:18,957
Barbara here intrigues me.

419
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:21,025
Barbara's not her real name.

420
00:25:21,027 --> 00:25:24,094
It's all part of the adventure.

421
00:25:24,096 --> 00:25:25,462
You don't know my name.

422
00:25:25,464 --> 00:25:28,665
Oh I knew you the second
I laid eyes on you.

423
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:31,570
You want power and money.

424
00:25:39,712 --> 00:25:43,782
I know it ain't 'cause of my pretty mug.

425
00:25:44,917 --> 00:25:47,751
I like your ears.

426
00:25:47,753 --> 00:25:52,658
If you want anything you
will rock Cleb's world.

427
00:25:54,126 --> 00:25:57,530
I need him crazy happy.

428
00:25:59,398 --> 00:26:02,767
[Jenna] He looks pretty happy to me.

429
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:06,772
Wait till you see him crazy happy.

430
00:26:28,662 --> 00:26:31,094
What time should I pick 'em up?

431
00:26:31,096 --> 00:26:33,864
Eh, leave 'em.

432
00:26:33,866 --> 00:26:38,068
Love's copped an attitude.
Let her find her own way home.

433
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:42,073
Sometimes think I'll just
kill everybody and start over.

434
00:26:42,075 --> 00:26:44,476
Nobody dependable anymore.

435
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:45,977
Might as well rotate through strangers

436
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,680
just bump off those
that don't make the cut.

437
00:26:48,682 --> 00:26:51,015
I'd say no to that.

438
00:26:51,017 --> 00:26:55,622
Hm, too much killing bad for business.

439
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:02,727
You can't retire from this business.

440
00:27:02,729 --> 00:27:04,696
In it 'till you die.

441
00:27:04,698 --> 00:27:08,034
Or until you die.

442
00:27:10,403 --> 00:27:13,606
More reason to kill everybody first.

443
00:27:21,448 --> 00:27:23,280
[Voiceover] Don't go.

444
00:27:23,282 --> 00:27:27,386
(whispering) (eerie music)

445
00:27:52,211 --> 00:27:55,248
Oh, just right.

446
00:28:18,872 --> 00:28:21,639
This is for the couch because my skin

447
00:28:21,641 --> 00:28:24,241
gets sticky and will stick to the leather.

448
00:28:24,243 --> 00:28:26,879
Oh god.

449
00:28:28,981 --> 00:28:31,617
I better stretch.

450
00:28:33,153 --> 00:28:35,586
I brought you something.

451
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,889
As long as it's not heroine.

452
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:40,626
I promised my sponsor.

453
00:28:41,795 --> 00:28:44,564
I'm into role playing.

454
00:28:48,634 --> 00:28:50,267
[Jenna] What is this, the sex olympics

455
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:52,170
and I'm your cheerleader?

456
00:28:52,172 --> 00:28:54,972
Not quite the plan.

457
00:28:54,974 --> 00:28:57,174
Go in the bathroom and put that on.

458
00:28:57,176 --> 00:29:00,077
While you're in there go ahead
and lose the bitch attitude.

459
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,379
I want you sweet.

460
00:29:01,381 --> 00:29:04,681
Ah, ah, ah, time is money.

461
00:29:04,683 --> 00:29:08,788
Come on it's gonna be fun!

462
00:29:28,942 --> 00:29:31,609
So what do you think?

463
00:29:31,611 --> 00:29:35,214
My ears I mean.

464
00:29:36,516 --> 00:29:38,248
As you 90's kids might say,

465
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:41,318
"All that and a bag of Doritos."

466
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,719
They suit you.

467
00:29:42,721 --> 00:29:44,622
Strong character.

468
00:29:44,624 --> 00:29:47,093
Nice wingspan.

469
00:29:51,431 --> 00:29:54,599
Not sure you look part
of the family though.

470
00:29:54,601 --> 00:29:57,200
We're all God's children.

471
00:29:57,202 --> 00:29:59,103
From time to time.

472
00:29:59,105 --> 00:30:02,039
Well what about me?

473
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:06,111
Am I cheese and crackers?

474
00:30:07,614 --> 00:30:10,314
You?

475
00:30:10,316 --> 00:30:12,816
You are the cats meow.

476
00:30:12,818 --> 00:30:14,419
(Love chuckles)

477
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,156
You can sit on the bed.

478
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:27,633
Should I relax or get sexy?

479
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,103
Well you could try tense
and ugly if you'd like,

480
00:30:32,105 --> 00:30:34,505
but I doubt you got the talent.

481
00:30:34,507 --> 00:30:37,341
Hm, sounds like a compliment.

482
00:30:37,343 --> 00:30:40,010
And a challenge.

483
00:30:40,012 --> 00:30:43,915
(random noises)

484
00:30:45,585 --> 00:30:48,621
Ha! Ready to bump this?

485
00:30:49,955 --> 00:30:53,458
(dark ambient music)

486
00:31:37,136 --> 00:31:39,438
Dance for me.

487
00:31:47,212 --> 00:31:49,479
Dance like your life depends on it.

488
00:31:49,481 --> 00:31:53,517
(laughing)

489
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,854
Oh yeah, that's it.

490
00:31:57,856 --> 00:32:01,660
Uh-huh, mm.

491
00:32:06,165 --> 00:32:08,165
Stop.

492
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:10,202
No.

493
00:32:12,204 --> 00:32:14,538
Like this.

494
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,275
(moaning)

495
00:32:20,747 --> 00:32:23,116
That's it.

496
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,925
Get on the bed.

497
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,530
Say, "Yes Mistress."

498
00:32:40,532 --> 00:32:43,535
Yes, Mistress.

499
00:32:57,317 --> 00:33:00,785
Lick my toes.

500
00:33:00,787 --> 00:33:02,989
Yes, Mistress.

501
00:33:09,796 --> 00:33:11,895
That's it.

502
00:33:11,897 --> 00:33:13,463
Really get 'em good.

503
00:33:13,465 --> 00:33:15,367
Yes, Mistress.

504
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:18,702
Get into it.

505
00:33:18,704 --> 00:33:23,141
Really get the soles clean.

506
00:33:25,144 --> 00:33:27,680
Oh yeah.

507
00:33:30,282 --> 00:33:34,085
Mm-hm, ah.

508
00:33:36,122 --> 00:33:37,889
(scoffs) You're too easy.

509
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:39,858
Come here.

510
00:33:58,278 --> 00:34:01,146
(Halley laughing)

511
00:34:03,615 --> 00:34:05,783
Command me, Madam.

512
00:34:05,785 --> 00:34:07,517
Suck my toes.

513
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,720
But I already did.

514
00:34:09,722 --> 00:34:11,289
Please, no more.

515
00:34:11,291 --> 00:34:14,527
Yes, more.

516
00:34:24,202 --> 00:34:27,039
Smell 'em, slave.

517
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,517
Tell me your name.

518
00:34:40,485 --> 00:34:43,253
A stranger will still be a stranger

519
00:34:43,255 --> 00:34:46,289
by any other name.

520
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:49,025
I want to know.

521
00:34:49,027 --> 00:34:51,762
Mm, you want to know Barbara.

522
00:34:51,764 --> 00:34:55,667
Behave and Barbara might let you.

523
00:34:57,003 --> 00:35:01,240
See now there you go.

524
00:35:02,641 --> 00:35:06,646
Just like your friend thinking
you got some kind of control.

525
00:35:07,746 --> 00:35:10,515
You're bought and paid for.

526
00:35:11,884 --> 00:35:14,584
Do you debate everything?

527
00:35:14,586 --> 00:35:17,688
We can sit here all night, chat.

528
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:20,392
Cool with me.

529
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,762
Your intelligence suits you.

530
00:35:24,764 --> 00:35:28,434
Why, strong character.

531
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,871
Nice wingspan.

532
00:35:33,873 --> 00:35:36,539
Okay old man.

533
00:35:36,541 --> 00:35:38,242
(Hate chuckles)

534
00:35:38,244 --> 00:35:42,713
What you refuse to
comprehend is a need for girls

535
00:35:42,715 --> 00:35:47,117
like my friend and I to
remain separate from the girls

536
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,220
you paid for.

537
00:35:50,222 --> 00:35:53,257
Oh, comprehension's got
nothing to do with it.

538
00:35:53,259 --> 00:35:54,425
Oh?

539
00:35:54,427 --> 00:35:55,592
I've just been around long enough

540
00:35:55,594 --> 00:35:57,028
to know better is all.

541
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:57,994
Really?

542
00:35:57,996 --> 00:35:59,130
(giggles)

543
00:35:59,132 --> 00:36:00,463
Come on.

544
00:36:00,465 --> 00:36:03,166
Are you the same guy that orders hookers or

545
00:36:03,168 --> 00:36:06,771
are you better than that guy?

546
00:36:10,342 --> 00:36:12,610
I'm looking for someone special.

547
00:36:12,612 --> 00:36:18,048
Mm, has it been a long search?

548
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:21,753
It's been ripe.

549
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,996
Let's dance.

550
00:36:31,998 --> 00:36:35,965
You don't need to woo
what's already been bought.

551
00:36:35,967 --> 00:36:37,836
Get up.

552
00:36:41,873 --> 00:36:44,642
Dance with me?

553
00:36:56,489 --> 00:36:59,090
(Love gasps)

554
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:01,691
But there isn't any music.

555
00:37:01,693 --> 00:37:04,228
There's always music.

556
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,464
You just gotta listen for it.

557
00:37:07,532 --> 00:37:10,903
Put your quarter in the juke.

558
00:37:12,338 --> 00:37:14,905
Circus music. (jaunty music)

559
00:37:14,907 --> 00:37:17,141
How fitting.

560
00:37:17,143 --> 00:37:19,245
Yeah.

561
00:37:20,545 --> 00:37:23,815
(humming)

562
00:37:26,985 --> 00:37:31,624
(grunting and chuckling)

563
00:37:35,862 --> 00:37:37,830
Now tell me your name.

564
00:37:39,297 --> 00:37:41,966
(Love pants)

565
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,568
Yeah?

566
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:47,871
Barbara Givens.

567
00:37:47,873 --> 00:37:50,206
(tense music)

568
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,477
Look at me.

569
00:37:55,981 --> 00:38:00,486
Now I want to take you by force...

570
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:07,423
but I need you to want me to.

571
00:38:07,425 --> 00:38:11,830
I don't go from normal to
psycho in just three seconds.

572
00:38:15,867 --> 00:38:19,003
One, two, three.

573
00:38:21,574 --> 00:38:24,708
(Hate grunting) (Love panting)

574
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,778
Tell me your name.

575
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,716
Give me your name.

576
00:38:32,117 --> 00:38:33,316
I will take it.

577
00:38:33,318 --> 00:38:35,287
I will take it!

578
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:42,592
Tell me your name!

579
00:38:42,594 --> 00:38:43,726
Love.

580
00:38:43,728 --> 00:38:44,295
What?

581
00:38:44,297 --> 00:38:45,798
Love.

582
00:38:47,065 --> 00:38:48,867
What?

583
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:54,240
Love, you asshole.

584
00:38:58,411 --> 00:39:01,580
This is the perfect circle.

585
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:12,658
I knew I would find you.

586
00:39:16,461 --> 00:39:19,295
Thank you. Harder.

587
00:39:19,297 --> 00:39:22,066
(slapping) (Selma gasps)

588
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,236
Thank you. Harder.

589
00:39:26,137 --> 00:39:27,906
(slapping)

590
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,710
Thank you. Harder.

591
00:39:32,844 --> 00:39:35,311
(slapping)

592
00:39:35,313 --> 00:39:37,849
Thank you. Softer.

593
00:39:39,217 --> 00:39:43,220
(slapping) Ah, hey!

594
00:39:43,222 --> 00:39:46,825
You take it and you like it, slave.

595
00:39:47,994 --> 00:39:50,429
(Selma moaning)

596
00:39:51,831 --> 00:39:56,100
Oh, you are very promising.

597
00:39:58,871 --> 00:40:01,839
Now we take it to the next level.

598
00:40:08,581 --> 00:40:12,383
So what, are you gonna
be a pain in the ass too?

599
00:40:12,385 --> 00:40:14,717
Like the sequel.

600
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:15,918
What?

601
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,822
"Pain in the Ass Part Two: Mo' Ass"

602
00:40:19,824 --> 00:40:21,791
You're a crackhead.

603
00:40:21,793 --> 00:40:25,595
Look, I might be new to
the game but I can play,

604
00:40:25,597 --> 00:40:28,898
and I need the money
so I can, I don't know,

605
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,633
afford stuff that I might need to afford.

606
00:40:30,635 --> 00:40:32,504
Bigger tits.

607
00:40:34,907 --> 00:40:37,907
I mean, I can't club and fuck forever.

608
00:40:37,909 --> 00:40:39,776
Hey by all means keep getting 'em bigger

609
00:40:39,778 --> 00:40:41,744
no matter how old.

610
00:40:41,746 --> 00:40:43,914
Be one of them freakshow grannies.

611
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:45,682
People pay.

612
00:40:45,684 --> 00:40:49,552
Mm, no thank you.

613
00:40:49,554 --> 00:40:51,889
I'm gonna find another way to spend my life

614
00:40:51,891 --> 00:40:55,227
or I don't know, maybe it'll find me.

615
00:40:56,362 --> 00:40:58,162
Look, I don't do sports.

616
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,332
Don't worry about that.

617
00:41:05,704 --> 00:41:08,606
I wanna watch you suck this off.

618
00:41:16,481 --> 00:41:18,684
Use both hands.

619
00:41:23,489 --> 00:41:25,822
Both hands.

620
00:41:25,824 --> 00:41:27,858
That's it.

621
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,230
Careful, don't chip a tooth.

622
00:41:49,849 --> 00:41:51,581
Ow!

623
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:52,816
What the hell was that?

624
00:41:52,818 --> 00:41:56,286
Just a little something.

625
00:41:56,288 --> 00:41:58,354
That's it.

626
00:41:58,356 --> 00:42:03,092
It'll feel good in a
minute just take it all in.

627
00:42:03,094 --> 00:42:06,431
I'm ready for the big game.

628
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:11,135
I'll do whatever you want.

629
00:42:11,137 --> 00:42:16,175
But call me a bitch again
and we're playing Bobbitt.

630
00:42:19,811 --> 00:42:23,213
I make the stories.

631
00:42:23,215 --> 00:42:25,850
I own the playground.

632
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,521
Recess is in session.

633
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:35,858
Give me a D.

634
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,628
Give me an A.

635
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,832
Lay down.

636
00:42:43,168 --> 00:42:45,838
(grunting)

637
00:42:52,744 --> 00:42:54,610
So if I'm the cheerleader,

638
00:42:54,612 --> 00:42:56,679
are you my studly football player?

639
00:42:56,681 --> 00:42:58,081
I like dinosuars.

640
00:42:58,083 --> 00:43:01,386
(ominous music) (growling)

641
00:43:09,661 --> 00:43:12,061
Okay stop, you're scaring me.

642
00:43:12,063 --> 00:43:14,066
(Cleb growling)

643
00:43:15,367 --> 00:43:17,236
Stop.

644
00:43:18,903 --> 00:43:21,939
(screaming)

645
00:43:26,878 --> 00:43:30,182
(Halley moaning)

646
00:43:40,693 --> 00:43:44,463
Oh, you sick whore!

647
00:43:50,168 --> 00:43:53,437
(Halley choking)

648
00:44:01,914 --> 00:44:03,448
(sighs)

649
00:44:06,251 --> 00:44:08,787
Oh, fucking hell.

650
00:44:10,222 --> 00:44:11,889
Must have been allergic.

651
00:44:11,891 --> 00:44:15,593
(Cleb growling) (dramatic music)

652
00:44:36,782 --> 00:44:41,117
(microwave beeping)

653
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,755
(ominous music)

654
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,984
Ah, just right.

655
00:45:15,153 --> 00:45:17,387
Oh you like that, don't you?

656
00:45:17,389 --> 00:45:21,490
Oh, you're so ripe.

657
00:45:21,492 --> 00:45:23,595
Oh yeah.

658
00:45:27,132 --> 00:45:29,199
Oh baby.

659
00:45:29,201 --> 00:45:32,336
(moaning)

660
00:45:32,338 --> 00:45:34,737
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

661
00:45:34,739 --> 00:45:37,642
Huh? Huh? Huh?

662
00:45:42,914 --> 00:45:45,414
(moaning)

663
00:45:45,416 --> 00:45:48,284
Yeah, uh you like that don't you?

664
00:45:48,286 --> 00:45:51,354
Yeah? Yeah? Oh yeah?

665
00:45:51,356 --> 00:45:53,123
Yeah? Yeah?

666
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:57,162
(moaning)

667
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:02,501
Oh, you're so juicy. (squelching)

668
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:10,242
Yeah.

669
00:46:11,577 --> 00:46:14,276
Oh.

670
00:46:14,278 --> 00:46:18,182
(squelching) (moaning)

671
00:46:27,425 --> 00:46:31,729
(tense music) (grunting and moaning)

672
00:46:55,219 --> 00:46:57,554
(laughing)

673
00:46:57,556 --> 00:46:59,423
Don't stop.

674
00:46:59,425 --> 00:47:01,393
Don't stop.

675
00:47:13,438 --> 00:47:15,339
Does that feel good?

676
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:27,986
(Selma scoffs)

677
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:33,123
Will you look at this mess you've made?

678
00:47:33,125 --> 00:47:34,493
Fuck.

679
00:47:37,028 --> 00:47:38,662
Fuck.

680
00:47:38,664 --> 00:47:41,600
(ominous music)

681
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:02,953
Cleb, this isn't a peep show.

682
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,428
Who's there?

683
00:48:17,101 --> 00:48:19,271
(chaotic music)

684
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:28,146
Don't chip a tooth, bitch.

685
00:48:30,615 --> 00:48:33,784
(ominous music)

686
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:37,856
You're having trouble making
up your mind, aren't ya?

687
00:48:39,724 --> 00:48:43,894
Well that's because you're
weighing the consequences.

688
00:48:43,896 --> 00:48:46,929
But are you thinking about the consequences

689
00:48:46,931 --> 00:48:50,167
of weighing those consequences?

690
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:59,476
You can only stall until your last breath.

691
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:02,180
(phone buzzing)

692
00:49:04,516 --> 00:49:06,615
Tick, tick, tick, tick.

How you doing man? What can I do for you?

712
00:49:57,668 --> 00:49:59,401
I'm looking for Sonny.

713
00:49:59,403 --> 00:50:01,637
Sonny. Well, we don't have any Sonny.

714
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:04,974
But I got some OJ, a little
soda, some purple stuff.

715
00:50:04,976 --> 00:50:07,644
Look dude, I'm not a cop.

716
00:50:07,646 --> 00:50:08,878
[Bartender] Okay.

717
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,979
Look, I need to talk to Sonny, all right?

718
00:50:09,981 --> 00:50:11,380
It's important.

719
00:50:11,382 --> 00:50:13,483
I told you, Sonny's not here.

720
00:50:13,485 --> 00:50:15,217
Well where can I find him?

721
00:50:15,219 --> 00:50:17,320
Look man, I just pour the drinks.

722
00:50:17,322 --> 00:50:19,322
You want something?

723
00:50:19,324 --> 00:50:20,923
Look, he'd want you to help me, all right?

724
00:50:20,925 --> 00:50:24,428
Otherwise I'm gonna have to call the cops.

725
00:50:26,097 --> 00:50:27,496
Don't piss me off.

726
00:50:27,498 --> 00:50:30,233
You want Sonny, you come when Sonny's here.

727
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:32,936
Otherwise talk to the manager.

728
00:50:32,938 --> 00:50:35,338
Need an after one special.

729
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:36,606
You the manager?

730
00:50:36,608 --> 00:50:38,407
[Woman] What the fuck you want, french fry?

731
00:50:38,409 --> 00:50:39,809
I'm looking for Sonny.

732
00:50:39,811 --> 00:50:41,610
You won't find Sonny
looking at the classy lady.

733
00:50:41,612 --> 00:50:42,778
Isn't this his place?

734
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,981
I'm the classy lady, Irma.

735
00:50:44,983 --> 00:50:46,249
Look, a friend of mine's missing.

736
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,653
I think Sonny could help.

737
00:50:53,692 --> 00:50:55,794
You want this?

738
00:50:57,496 --> 00:50:59,061
Why would I want that?

739
00:50:59,063 --> 00:51:01,865
Gave you a fucking shot, french fry.

740
00:51:01,867 --> 00:51:03,867
What the fuck?

741
00:51:03,869 --> 00:51:06,302
What is that?

742
00:51:06,304 --> 00:51:09,371
Listen kid, Poot's gonna
be in tomorrow around two.

743
00:51:09,373 --> 00:51:11,007
Why don't you come in and
talk to him, all right?

744
00:51:11,009 --> 00:51:12,309
Get yourself out of here.

745
00:51:12,311 --> 00:51:14,411
Hey hey hey!

746
00:51:14,413 --> 00:51:17,781
It ain't nice to leave
without tipping the ladies.

747
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:24,055
(ominous music)

748
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:27,590
(Love moaning)

749
00:51:27,592 --> 00:51:29,627
(Love gasping)

750
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:35,932
Hey there, sleepy head.

751
00:51:35,934 --> 00:51:39,135
(chuckles) Oh come on, admit it.

752
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:41,371
Love and Hate.

753
00:51:41,373 --> 00:51:46,377
Uh, that is too grand
to be a coniencidence.

754
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,512
Just means that my parents were into peace

755
00:51:49,514 --> 00:51:50,847
and yours were santanists.

756
00:51:50,849 --> 00:51:52,414
(Hate giggles)

757
00:51:52,416 --> 00:51:55,985
Oh, I'll free you from that logic soon.

758
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:57,519
Let me go.

759
00:51:57,521 --> 00:51:59,923
Go?

760
00:51:59,925 --> 00:52:02,160
You ain't going nowhere, Love.

761
00:52:03,228 --> 00:52:06,131
(chuckles) Love!

762
00:52:08,065 --> 00:52:10,400
Oh, come on now.

763
00:52:10,402 --> 00:52:13,705
Shh, now listen to me.

764
00:52:14,806 --> 00:52:17,240
Become the truth.

765
00:52:17,242 --> 00:52:18,675
Huh?

766
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:21,177
Oh shh.

767
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:23,545
Show me the way.

768
00:52:23,547 --> 00:52:27,050
Yes, you be the key.

769
00:52:27,052 --> 00:52:28,918
You reap the glory.

770
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,619
The way is to let me go.

771
00:52:30,621 --> 00:52:35,124
Oh see, people always want revolution

772
00:52:35,126 --> 00:52:37,760
but you have to force them to participate.

773
00:52:37,762 --> 00:52:41,798
Now, I see your cravin' for change.

774
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,166
It's our craving.

775
00:52:44,168 --> 00:52:47,137
(Love sobbing)

776
00:52:48,539 --> 00:52:49,941
That's it.

777
00:52:51,777 --> 00:52:53,675
We must leave our skin.

778
00:52:53,677 --> 00:52:55,979
You're a late bloomer, huh?

779
00:52:55,981 --> 00:52:59,081
Fucking middle school anarchist!

780
00:52:59,083 --> 00:52:59,983
Man has...

781
00:52:59,985 --> 00:53:04,220
Ah! Blah! Blah, crazy!

782
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,487
No, you don't understand.

783
00:53:05,489 --> 00:53:08,458
You are fucking crazy.
I don't understand you.

784
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,061
There's no magic anymore!

785
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:13,329
(Love sobbing)

786
00:53:13,331 --> 00:53:14,530
They take that away from you

787
00:53:14,532 --> 00:53:18,202
and make you doubt it was even there.

788
00:53:20,539 --> 00:53:23,341
But revolution has magic.

789
00:53:24,675 --> 00:53:26,041
The magic of revolution.

790
00:53:26,043 --> 00:53:28,546
The magic revolution.

791
00:53:31,949 --> 00:53:35,217
Let's just become about

792
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:38,287
shakin' shit up to make
people believe something.

793
00:53:38,289 --> 00:53:41,191
To force 'em to believe!

794
00:53:41,193 --> 00:53:44,026
And it ain't for free, either.

795
00:53:44,028 --> 00:53:48,264
You always gotta give 'em somethin'.

796
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:51,767
No such thing as blind faith anymore.

797
00:53:51,769 --> 00:53:54,737
Everybody wants somethin' so you gotta

798
00:53:54,739 --> 00:53:58,343
give it to 'em to keep the
energy balancing, you know?

799
00:54:00,545 --> 00:54:02,010
Something like...

800
00:54:02,012 --> 00:54:04,548
(dramatic music) (Love screams)

801
00:54:05,684 --> 00:54:09,521
(Love sobbing)

802
00:54:10,889 --> 00:54:14,456
The whole world is pain, Love.

803
00:54:14,458 --> 00:54:17,294
We must find pleasure in it.

804
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:21,030
Shh. (Love sobbing)

805
00:54:21,032 --> 00:54:23,266
Shh.

806
00:54:23,268 --> 00:54:27,070
(Love sobbing)

807
00:54:27,072 --> 00:54:28,740
Good.

808
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:35,577
Love, let's take this slow, shall we?

809
00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:39,916
(Love screaming)

810
00:54:39,918 --> 00:54:43,019
Shh. (Love sobbing)

811
00:54:43,021 --> 00:54:45,757
Yeah, now...

812
00:54:47,726 --> 00:54:52,662
(Love sobbing)

813
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:55,697
(Love grunting)

814
00:54:55,699 --> 00:54:59,202
(Love panting and sobbing)

815
00:54:59,204 --> 00:55:03,139
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to enter you now.

816
00:55:03,141 --> 00:55:06,410
(Love grunting and groaning) Shh. Shh.

817
00:55:13,617 --> 00:55:16,019
(grunts)

818
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:19,356
Hold still.

819
00:55:28,833 --> 00:55:31,568
Do I know you?

820
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:33,235
Yeah we've done business before.

821
00:55:33,237 --> 00:55:35,003
(chuckles) Nice cologne.

822
00:55:35,005 --> 00:55:37,307
What's it called, Narcee?

823
00:55:37,309 --> 00:55:40,409
I'm not a cop, come on.

824
00:55:40,411 --> 00:55:43,313
Oh, we got a slick one!

825
00:55:43,315 --> 00:55:45,882
Look, I wanna talk to Sonny.

826
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:47,050
He's listed.

827
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:49,351
I've tried that.

828
00:55:49,353 --> 00:55:50,019
Really?

829
00:55:50,021 --> 00:55:51,119
Yeah.

830
00:55:51,121 --> 00:55:53,155
Hold on, let me try.

831
00:55:53,157 --> 00:55:57,092
(makes beeping sounds)

832
00:55:57,094 --> 00:56:01,530
(hums engaged tone)

833
00:56:01,532 --> 00:56:03,700
Sucks for you!

834
00:56:03,702 --> 00:56:05,034
Bye.

835
00:56:05,036 --> 00:56:06,869
[Ned] Have you seen Love?

836
00:56:06,871 --> 00:56:11,309
She was supposed to call me last night.

837
00:56:13,143 --> 00:56:14,510
Wow. Okay.

838
00:56:14,512 --> 00:56:18,847
How do I put this, um, delicate?

839
00:56:18,849 --> 00:56:22,519
She's out, trickin' dick.

840
00:56:24,289 --> 00:56:26,155
Did you think you were special?

841
00:56:26,157 --> 00:56:27,889
Look, I wanna talk to Sonny.

842
00:56:27,891 --> 00:56:29,092
(Poot chuckles)

843
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:32,062
You're a stalker, huh?

844
00:56:34,032 --> 00:56:37,468
Jackson's no stalker though, huh?

845
00:56:38,702 --> 00:56:41,039
Uh...

846
00:56:42,206 --> 00:56:43,840
okay!

847
00:57:04,929 --> 00:57:08,031
Were you pretending, hm?

848
00:57:14,706 --> 00:57:18,443
You know, you brought a
valiant fight to the fuck.

849
00:57:21,478 --> 00:57:25,514
My army will rise with
that spirit as its backbone.

850
00:57:25,516 --> 00:57:27,516
It was resistance.

851
00:57:27,518 --> 00:57:29,818
And what army? You and the other two tarts?

852
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:32,954
(chuckles) Cleb and Selma?

853
00:57:32,956 --> 00:57:35,224
Well, you see, Love,

854
00:57:35,226 --> 00:57:36,726
you buy a toy that's
broken, you know what you're

855
00:57:36,728 --> 00:57:39,729
playing with, you know?

856
00:57:39,731 --> 00:57:43,465
Cleb and Selma have proven their loyalty.

857
00:57:43,467 --> 00:57:47,704
Now, they're gonna be dust soon but...

858
00:57:49,541 --> 00:57:52,075
well, they served their purpose!

859
00:57:52,077 --> 00:57:54,443
You win.

860
00:57:54,445 --> 00:57:56,679
Untie me.

861
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:58,616
Let's go revolt.

862
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:01,819
Really?

863
00:58:04,621 --> 00:58:05,954
No, I think I'll go have lunch.

864
00:58:05,956 --> 00:58:08,358
(Love grunts) (Hate chuckles)

865
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:11,029
But, when I come back...

866
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:15,998
I'm gonna beat the holy crap out of you.

867
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,738
And then, I'll deliver you unto the portal.

868
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,639
Enjoy your last meal.

869
00:58:24,641 --> 00:58:27,110
(Hate chuckles)

870
00:58:27,112 --> 00:58:29,045
Yeah, try that.

871
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:31,347
Go ahead, you just lie
there with your pretty self

872
00:58:31,349 --> 00:58:34,784
and you will me to choke or something.

873
00:58:34,786 --> 00:58:37,588
Better yet.

874
00:58:41,092 --> 00:58:42,593
Now...

875
00:58:44,027 --> 00:58:46,862
you just try to get a hand free.

876
00:58:46,864 --> 00:58:50,700
I come back, you'll
smother me with a pillow.

877
00:58:50,702 --> 00:58:54,269
Now that I know your death
wish I'll be sure to satisfy.

878
00:58:54,271 --> 00:58:55,640
Oh...

879
00:58:57,074 --> 00:58:59,242
I hope you mean that.

880
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:04,447
Anyway.

881
00:59:04,449 --> 00:59:06,317
(Love gasps)

882
00:59:11,121 --> 00:59:14,791
Don't go crying when I leave this room now.

883
00:59:14,793 --> 00:59:16,928
I'll be listening.

884
00:59:22,333 --> 00:59:24,035
(door closing)

885
00:59:25,135 --> 00:59:26,802
I figured it'd be that way.

886
00:59:26,804 --> 00:59:28,537
As long as I didn't send the car around.

887
00:59:28,539 --> 00:59:29,905
Second night is gonna cost you though,

888
00:59:29,907 --> 00:59:32,109
those are my best girls.

889
00:59:34,746 --> 00:59:36,379
Uh-huh.

890
00:59:37,882 --> 00:59:40,249
Same as before, plus three more.

891
00:59:40,251 --> 00:59:42,485
Mm-hm.

892
00:59:42,487 --> 00:59:45,621
I'll run the card again.

893
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:47,524
Enjoy.

894
00:59:51,496 --> 00:59:54,265
Stalker, followed me.

895
00:59:56,067 --> 00:59:59,568
I'm looking for Love.

896
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:03,374
We can't guarantee anything
but, I know some wild chicks.

897
01:00:04,775 --> 01:00:06,508
Have a seat, start talking money.

898
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:07,709
Look, cut the bullshit, all right?

899
01:00:07,711 --> 01:00:09,244
You know who I'm talking about.

900
01:00:09,246 --> 01:00:12,014
(chuckles) Uh-oh.

901
01:00:12,016 --> 01:00:15,217
It's okay, Poot. I'm
in a better mood today.

902
01:00:15,219 --> 01:00:17,452
Look, no disrespect, all right?

903
01:00:17,454 --> 01:00:19,921
I'm just worried about her.

904
01:00:19,923 --> 01:00:23,659
Tabby, start me some businessin' music.

905
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:25,827
(rock music)

906
01:00:25,829 --> 01:00:27,295
You called.

907
01:00:27,297 --> 01:00:28,331
What was your name?

908
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,965
Ned.

909
01:00:29,967 --> 01:00:32,034
Now peep this, Ned.

910
01:00:32,036 --> 01:00:36,171
Love is a hooker. Nasty.

911
01:00:36,173 --> 01:00:39,008
Me? I'm a pimp.

912
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,010
Love's pimp.

913
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:45,380
I pick who gets to get their jollies off.

914
01:00:45,382 --> 01:00:47,782
On her face.

915
01:00:47,784 --> 01:00:50,387
Are your jollies backed up?

916
01:00:53,157 --> 01:00:56,027
I'm her boyfriend.

917
01:00:58,463 --> 01:01:00,862
People always have to pay me first.

918
01:01:00,864 --> 01:01:02,264
She was supposed to call me last night.

919
01:01:02,266 --> 01:01:06,838
People always have to pay me first!

920
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:10,307
Tabby!

921
01:01:13,277 --> 01:01:16,112
Look, I just wanna know if she's okay!

922
01:01:20,485 --> 01:01:23,754
Sonny, do you know where she is? Please.

923
01:01:40,572 --> 01:01:42,003
Hey!

924
01:01:42,005 --> 01:01:44,039
Um...

925
01:01:44,041 --> 01:01:47,342
Sonny says that if you see Love again,

926
01:01:47,344 --> 01:01:50,445
he's gonna break both your legs.

927
01:01:50,447 --> 01:01:52,715
And he's not talking about both your legs,

928
01:01:52,717 --> 01:01:56,821
he's also talking about breaking hers too.

929
01:01:58,188 --> 01:02:00,124
Nice meetin' ya!

930
01:02:04,461 --> 01:02:06,095
(ominous music)

931
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:09,133
(Love panting)

932
01:02:19,911 --> 01:02:24,415
(Love grunting and groaning)

933
01:02:29,987 --> 01:02:33,290
Do you hear something?

934
01:02:34,692 --> 01:02:36,626
Desperation.

935
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:40,998
(Love groaning and sobbing)

936
01:02:50,775 --> 01:02:53,441
(Love screaming)

937
01:02:53,443 --> 01:02:57,247
(Love panting)

938
01:03:11,028 --> 01:03:14,999
(tense music)

939
01:03:34,351 --> 01:03:36,584
Oh, god!

940
01:03:36,586 --> 01:03:38,420
Oh, there's a catch.

941
01:03:38,422 --> 01:03:41,824
Oh, we got one.

942
01:03:41,826 --> 01:03:44,861
(Hate whistling)

943
01:03:46,797 --> 01:03:51,368
(Love panting)

944
01:03:52,936 --> 01:03:54,269
She is beautiful.

945
01:03:54,271 --> 01:03:56,438
Just another canary.

946
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:00,108
(Love screaming) (dramatic music)

947
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:02,077
- [Selma] Going somewhere?
- [Hate] Hold her.

948
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:04,179
What? Come without a call?

949
01:04:04,181 --> 01:04:05,981
Please don't do this to me.

950
01:04:05,983 --> 01:04:08,719
Don't give up.

951
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:13,521
(Selma chuckles)

952
01:04:13,523 --> 01:04:16,124
♪ Aw shit girl, break
out your titties ♪

953
01:04:16,126 --> 01:04:18,260
♪ Shake 'em around, I got your tip ♪

954
01:04:18,262 --> 01:04:19,561
♪ What's it gonna
take for you to strip ♪

955
01:04:19,563 --> 01:04:21,996
We need to meet like this more often.

956
01:04:21,998 --> 01:04:23,865
You know, you're a real life saver, Mike.

957
01:04:23,867 --> 01:04:25,434
I'd rather be a Skittle.

958
01:04:25,436 --> 01:04:27,903
(Ned and Mike chuckle)

959
01:04:27,905 --> 01:04:31,206
Hi, uh, do you sell donuts?

960
01:04:31,208 --> 01:04:33,909
My friend and I are here
on a stakeout and we're

961
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:35,043
awfully hungry.

962
01:04:35,045 --> 01:04:38,246
Be a while to ya, darlin'.

963
01:04:38,248 --> 01:04:41,717
(chuckles) Ah, bring your own donuts.

964
01:04:41,719 --> 01:04:43,318
That's adorable.

965
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,554
But what you can do, you
can get my friend here

966
01:04:45,556 --> 01:04:47,222
a large soda pop.

967
01:04:47,224 --> 01:04:49,325
I'll bring him a coke.

968
01:04:49,327 --> 01:04:50,992
Yes.

969
01:04:50,994 --> 01:04:52,228
She went to the bathroom.

970
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:54,929
(Ned chuckles)

971
01:04:54,931 --> 01:04:56,197
Did I just order you a soda?

972
01:04:56,199 --> 01:04:58,934
I mean, in this places, you never can tell.

973
01:04:58,936 --> 01:05:01,936
Elvis is weed, Marilyn
is coke, so we're good.

974
01:05:01,938 --> 01:05:04,240
Look at you all gritty nitty!

975
01:05:04,242 --> 01:05:06,275
Gritty nitty.

976
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:07,842
(Mike giggles)

977
01:05:07,844 --> 01:05:10,012
All right, seriously. Your Love?

978
01:05:10,014 --> 01:05:11,213
She's a keeper.

979
01:05:11,215 --> 01:05:12,782
Yeah...

980
01:05:12,784 --> 01:05:16,786
I would say I'm pretty
head-over-heels for her.

981
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:18,287
That's what I've been saying.

982
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:19,554
You have been saying that.

983
01:05:19,556 --> 01:05:20,655
Yeah. Yeah.

984
01:05:20,657 --> 01:05:21,757
She's pretty awesome.

985
01:05:21,759 --> 01:05:23,793
You're pretty awesome.

986
01:05:23,795 --> 01:05:27,295
Now, do you think you're up for this?

987
01:05:27,297 --> 01:05:29,130
SOCOM.

988
01:05:29,132 --> 01:05:30,465
Call of Duty.

989
01:05:30,467 --> 01:05:31,266
Oh, yes.

990
01:05:31,268 --> 01:05:35,037
Counter-fucking-Strike

991
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:35,804
Headshot.

992
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:37,807
Fuckin' A. Hey!

993
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:39,842
Dude, you cannot doubt
my wingman capabilities

994
01:05:39,844 --> 01:05:40,842
or commitment.

995
01:05:40,844 --> 01:05:42,311
Sweet.

996
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:45,014
I mean, I don't even know if
he's gonna come back or not.

997
01:05:45,016 --> 01:05:49,017
No matter what, plans
A through C, I'm here.

998
01:05:49,019 --> 01:05:51,753
Well it's more like a big plan A, you know,

999
01:05:51,755 --> 01:05:54,889
or nothing, and nothing isn't happening.

1000
01:05:54,891 --> 01:05:56,325
Seven bucks.

1001
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:58,126
Can we put this on a tab
'cause we're probably gonna

1002
01:05:58,128 --> 01:06:01,463
order some more sodas.

1003
01:06:01,465 --> 01:06:02,700
Sure.

1004
01:06:05,335 --> 01:06:07,036
Ah man, thanks.

1005
01:06:07,038 --> 01:06:08,372
Hey!

1006
01:06:11,943 --> 01:06:15,346
That's him right there.

1007
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:21,749
Hey!

1008
01:06:21,751 --> 01:06:24,787
Hi there, baby! (giggles)

1009
01:06:24,789 --> 01:06:27,523
You been working out?
You look really strong.

1010
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:29,291
Oh yeah, that's why I'm all sweaty.

1011
01:06:29,293 --> 01:06:31,894
I've been working out
at the HomeTown Buffet.

1012
01:06:31,896 --> 01:06:33,561
(giggles) (stripper giggles)

1013
01:06:33,563 --> 01:06:35,563
All right, listen, so
keep your eyes on him.

1014
01:06:35,565 --> 01:06:38,400
If he leaves, just give me a call.

1015
01:06:38,402 --> 01:06:40,802
Are you sure you just don't
want me to ride with you?

1016
01:06:40,804 --> 01:06:43,304
No no. I don't want you getting
mixed up with Sonny, man.

1017
01:06:43,306 --> 01:06:44,606
He is bad news.

1018
01:06:44,608 --> 01:06:46,175
Keep your eyes on the goon.

1019
01:06:46,177 --> 01:06:48,376
Give me a call.

1020
01:06:48,378 --> 01:06:51,014
(Mike drowned out by atmospherics)

1021
01:06:54,251 --> 01:06:57,552
(stripper giggling) (Poot mumbling)

1022
01:06:57,554 --> 01:06:58,854
And there it goes!

1023
01:06:58,856 --> 01:07:01,523
It's like David Copperfield.

1024
01:07:01,525 --> 01:07:03,025
The champagne room?

1025
01:07:03,027 --> 01:07:05,693
Ah, but there's no champagne there though!

1026
01:07:05,695 --> 01:07:09,098
(chuckles)

1027
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,400
I'm gonna need change!

1028
01:07:12,402 --> 01:07:15,905
(police siren)

1029
01:07:20,644 --> 01:07:22,046
(thud)

1030
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:25,848
Where is she?

1031
01:07:28,652 --> 01:07:30,786
Your bitch don't even
tell you where she lives.

1032
01:07:30,788 --> 01:07:32,688
Because she stays here.

1033
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:34,889
This is home invasion.

1034
01:07:34,891 --> 01:07:35,891
[Ned] I'd say in your profession,

1035
01:07:35,893 --> 01:07:37,659
your door should be stronger.

1036
01:07:37,661 --> 01:07:39,796
I shoot trespassers.

1037
01:07:42,065 --> 01:07:43,766
Prince!

1038
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:45,569
(groans)

1039
01:07:52,376 --> 01:07:54,709
Like you know how to use it.

1040
01:07:54,711 --> 01:07:58,448
Hell, I never even keep it loaded.

1041
01:08:03,153 --> 01:08:05,054
Play a lot of video games, do ya?

1042
01:08:05,056 --> 01:08:07,289
I want the address where you sent her.

1043
01:08:07,291 --> 01:08:09,624
[Sonny] Hook up with her, a lot of trouble

1044
01:08:09,626 --> 01:08:11,260
and a lot of debt.

1045
01:08:11,262 --> 01:08:13,329
I'll keep the gun then.

1046
01:08:13,331 --> 01:08:14,630
I've got more.

1047
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:17,132
I dare you to go for them.

1048
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:19,535
You know the problem with being a hero?

1049
01:08:19,537 --> 01:08:24,039
Saving everyone else and no
one will watch your own ass.

1050
01:08:24,041 --> 01:08:25,773
You think that I'm not a hero

1051
01:08:25,775 --> 01:08:28,376
'cause I'll have no problem
packin' up and running far away.

1052
01:08:28,378 --> 01:08:30,748
Now give me the fucking address!

1053
01:08:31,916 --> 01:08:34,517
Tabby, notebook.

1054
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,299
Give me that. Give me the fucking thing.

1055
01:08:51,301 --> 01:08:54,370
I'll be watching your ass.

1056
01:08:55,439 --> 01:08:57,205
The only way you'll see
me again is if this address

1057
01:08:57,207 --> 01:08:59,042
is wrong.

1058
01:09:02,579 --> 01:09:04,847
[Sonny] Where you goin'?

1059
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:06,915
Shutting the fucking door
before the fucking turtle

1060
01:09:06,917 --> 01:09:08,517
gets into the fucking sewer

1061
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:10,753
and gets teenage fucking mutated.

1062
01:09:10,755 --> 01:09:12,821
Sometimes I swear, if you weren't my kid...

1063
01:09:12,823 --> 01:09:14,956
Yeah? You would.

1064
01:09:14,958 --> 01:09:16,759
Yeah, I might.

1065
01:09:16,761 --> 01:09:18,192
(chuckles)

1066
01:09:18,194 --> 01:09:20,995
Come here and give daddy a big wet one.

1067
01:09:20,997 --> 01:09:22,865
All right.

1068
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:28,536
You see, suspension keeps
the energy at the threshold.

1069
01:09:28,538 --> 01:09:33,642
Spasms can send her back over
the portal and back again.

1070
01:09:33,644 --> 01:09:37,146
So, the alert spirit

1071
01:09:37,148 --> 01:09:41,383
uses that friction to toe the line.

1072
01:09:41,385 --> 01:09:44,318
At least in theory, anyway.

1073
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:46,289
Most just die.

1074
01:09:49,793 --> 01:09:52,096
But you ain't most.

1075
01:09:53,831 --> 01:09:56,865
Why do you wanna work at Wordack?

1076
01:09:56,867 --> 01:09:58,635
I need a job.

1077
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:02,638
Our counselors have to deal
with women who are abused,

1078
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,973
who have been raped, who
are addicted to drugs.

1079
01:10:05,975 --> 01:10:09,378
It's very serious work, very trying work.

1080
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:11,979
Yeah I understand that.

1081
01:10:11,981 --> 01:10:14,782
Well generally, we require our employees

1082
01:10:14,784 --> 01:10:17,718
to have a college degree.

1083
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,822
I don't have that.

1084
01:10:21,391 --> 01:10:24,259
And you don't have very
much work experience.

1085
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:26,794
And no references.

1086
01:10:26,796 --> 01:10:30,934
What makes you think you're
qualified for this position?

1087
01:10:32,269 --> 01:10:34,538
(Love chuckles)

1088
01:10:38,074 --> 01:10:41,910
Did you lose your virginity to your father?

1089
01:10:41,912 --> 01:10:43,978
Yeah probably not, huh?

1090
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:49,250
Fucked is all I got until I
skipped out on high school.

1091
01:10:49,252 --> 01:10:53,388
I saw a way out and I took it.

1092
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:56,357
Have you ever smoked crack?

1093
01:10:56,359 --> 01:10:57,894
Hm?

1094
01:10:58,962 --> 01:11:01,629
Shot heroine? Snorted coke?

1095
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:03,632
Stayed up a week on meth
and then took whatever pills

1096
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:05,032
you could find laying around?

1097
01:11:05,034 --> 01:11:07,835
Not because you were having
fun but because you are

1098
01:11:07,837 --> 01:11:12,307
definitely not having fun.

1099
01:11:12,309 --> 01:11:15,576
What about dressed up in your Sunday best

1100
01:11:15,578 --> 01:11:19,281
to go suck cock for money?

1101
01:11:19,283 --> 01:11:22,017
Only to get blood on it

1102
01:11:22,019 --> 01:11:25,053
because your pimp had his ring on,

1103
01:11:25,055 --> 01:11:28,757
because you handed him wrinkled bills.

1104
01:11:28,759 --> 01:11:31,093
You know and sometimes,
you don't even bother using

1105
01:11:31,095 --> 01:11:34,562
a condom because hey, if you're
lucky you'll catch a disease

1106
01:11:34,564 --> 01:11:39,001
and you might have something
in life and an end in sight.

1107
01:11:41,404 --> 01:11:45,040
Or do you know what it's like
to work a job where any night

1108
01:11:45,042 --> 01:11:48,777
you can end up dead in
an alleyway somewhere?

1109
01:11:48,779 --> 01:11:52,481
Face-down in the dirt, knowing no one,

1110
01:11:52,483 --> 01:11:56,785
no one's gonna give a shit
'cause you don't give a shit.

1111
01:11:56,787 --> 01:12:00,089
Yeah well, I give a shit.

1112
01:12:02,993 --> 01:12:08,330
What makes you think you're
so qualified for this position?

1113
01:12:08,332 --> 01:12:11,101
When would you be available to start?

1114
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:19,907
Um, Monday?

1115
01:12:19,909 --> 01:12:23,010
Good. We'll set up a drug test.

1116
01:12:23,012 --> 01:12:25,813
Yeah, okay.

1117
01:12:25,815 --> 01:12:28,016
Thanks.

1118
01:12:28,018 --> 01:12:29,250
[Manager] Good luck.

1119
01:12:29,252 --> 01:12:30,152
Yeah.

1120
01:12:30,154 --> 01:12:32,789
(gasps) (tense music)

1121
01:12:41,731 --> 01:12:44,098
(choking)

1122
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:48,169
You can only stall until your last breath.

1123
01:12:48,171 --> 01:12:49,071
(Jenna screaming)

1124
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:50,138
(Halley gasping)

1125
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:54,444
(heartbeats)

1126
01:13:07,457 --> 01:13:11,928
(Hate breathing heavily)

1127
01:13:19,235 --> 01:13:21,003
(whelps)

1128
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:28,277
(sobs)

1129
01:13:28,279 --> 01:13:31,848
(chuckles)

1130
01:13:42,993 --> 01:13:47,664
(breathing heavily)

1131
01:14:22,332 --> 01:14:23,833
Okay.

1132
01:14:25,368 --> 01:14:28,870
It's not...

1133
01:14:28,872 --> 01:14:31,673
it's not in my nature

1134
01:14:31,675 --> 01:14:33,974
to go easy

1135
01:14:33,976 --> 01:14:37,812
on anything or anyone.

1136
01:14:37,814 --> 01:14:39,682
But...

1137
01:14:42,353 --> 01:14:45,754
I wanted to give you an advantage.

1138
01:14:45,756 --> 01:14:48,824
It's perfect.

1139
01:14:48,826 --> 01:14:51,393
You, fighting to live...

1140
01:14:51,395 --> 01:14:54,463
(chuckles)

1141
01:14:54,465 --> 01:14:57,367
and me fighting to die.

1142
01:14:58,569 --> 01:15:01,171
One-on-one
time.

1143
01:15:02,238 --> 01:15:04,339
I'm not fighting for you.

1144
01:15:04,341 --> 01:15:06,843
It wasn't a choice.

1145
01:15:10,847 --> 01:15:12,716
Oh...

1146
01:15:14,251 --> 01:15:16,820
you brought ghosts!

1147
01:15:18,921 --> 01:15:20,589
Ladies.

1148
01:15:23,092 --> 01:15:24,659
(dramatic music)

1149
01:15:24,661 --> 01:15:29,132
(grunting and groaning) (thuds)

1150
01:15:42,445 --> 01:15:44,345
(mumbles)

1151
01:15:44,347 --> 01:15:48,685
They really owe you
enough to finish the job.

1152
01:16:01,664 --> 01:16:02,865
Ah!

1153
01:16:04,701 --> 01:16:06,302
I fucked up!

1154
01:16:08,204 --> 01:16:10,673
I gave 'em peace.

1155
01:16:12,975 --> 01:16:14,410
Oh.

1156
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:18,949
Is this the last act, lover?

1157
01:16:20,216 --> 01:16:24,153
(dramatic music) (Love screaming)

1158
01:16:38,435 --> 01:16:42,038
(Love panting)

1159
01:16:55,385 --> 01:17:00,022
(somber music)

1160
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:54,678
(dark dramatic music)

1161
01:18:33,951 --> 01:18:36,084
No!

1162
01:18:36,086 --> 01:18:37,787
No, don't...

1163
01:18:49,365 --> 01:18:50,965
Don't go.

1164
01:18:50,967 --> 01:18:53,168
Don't leave me, come on.

1165
01:18:54,304 --> 01:18:56,071
Come on!

1166
01:18:56,073 --> 01:18:59,776
(sobbing)

1167
01:19:07,484 --> 01:19:09,718
I need help!

1168
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:12,920
1807 Fetiga Road.

1169
01:19:12,922 --> 01:19:14,789
Help, please.

1170
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:16,927
Hurry up!

1171
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:31,039
You have given me...

1172
01:19:31,041 --> 01:19:33,310
the world.

1173
01:19:42,219 --> 01:19:44,687
(Love gasps)

1174
01:19:46,622 --> 01:19:49,624
Oh, I thought I was gonna lose you.

1175
01:19:49,626 --> 01:19:51,928
Help's on their way right now.

1176
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:55,832
I love you.

1177
01:20:04,006 --> 01:20:06,007
Nighty night time, little man.

1178
01:20:06,009 --> 01:20:07,608
Daddy loves his baby boy.

1179
01:20:07,610 --> 01:20:10,613
Yes he does, yes he does.

1180
01:20:12,582 --> 01:20:16,820
(ominous music) (door rattling)

1181
01:20:18,689 --> 01:20:20,190
Again?

1182
01:20:21,792 --> 01:20:24,025
Don't know who the hell you think you are.

1183
01:20:24,027 --> 01:20:25,927
But I am the wrong man to be getting into

1184
01:20:25,929 --> 01:20:27,661
a pissing contest with!

1185
01:20:27,663 --> 01:20:31,234
Now I'm gonna fix that
door right after I fix you!

1186
01:20:33,936 --> 01:20:35,736
Stay away from me.

1187
01:20:35,738 --> 01:20:38,039
Stay away from, stay away from me!

1188
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:40,075
No! No! No!

1189
01:20:43,447 --> 01:20:47,617
(Poot coughing)

1190
01:20:56,893 --> 01:20:59,195
Give it back then.

1191
01:21:00,663 --> 01:21:01,730
So...

1192
01:21:02,832 --> 01:21:04,833
where are you goin'?

1193
01:21:06,336 --> 01:21:10,573
Some self-imposed hell with sunshine?

1194
01:21:14,444 --> 01:21:17,845
You know, I could use a new lackey.

1195
01:21:17,847 --> 01:21:21,818
I seemed to have misplaced my last ones.

1196
01:21:22,953 --> 01:21:25,553
Turns out they were
more interested in escape

1197
01:21:25,555 --> 01:21:29,257
than fighting.

1198
01:21:29,259 --> 01:21:31,092
See you don't wanna have to go to this side

1199
01:21:31,094 --> 01:21:33,961
but you do gotta be ready.

1200
01:21:33,963 --> 01:21:37,499
Else you're just a haunting.

1201
01:21:39,235 --> 01:21:41,805
Ghost feign.

1202
01:21:45,274 --> 01:21:48,977
Are you a ghost?

1203
01:21:48,979 --> 01:21:52,281
You haven't grasped any of this, have you?

1204
01:21:55,786 --> 01:21:57,919
Fuckin' hurt me, man.

1205
01:21:57,921 --> 01:22:00,554
Use it.

1206
01:22:00,556 --> 01:22:04,025
Use it to release your fear of the unknown.

1207
01:22:04,027 --> 01:22:05,226
I don't wanna die.

1208
01:22:05,228 --> 01:22:08,428
Well that betters your odds then.

1209
01:22:08,430 --> 01:22:12,634
See if you got what it takes
to join me in revolution.

1210
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:15,169
(chuckles) Revolting?

1211
01:22:15,171 --> 01:22:17,272
Against what?

1212
01:22:21,778 --> 01:22:25,312
Humanity.

1213
01:22:25,314 --> 01:22:29,651
Shit. You are a ghost.

1214
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:32,789
I am hope.

1215
01:22:34,291 --> 01:22:38,893
For God so loved the world
that he fuckin' vanished.

1216
01:22:38,895 --> 01:22:41,062
Me, I hate it.

1217
01:22:41,064 --> 01:22:45,299
I hate it with a passion so strong

1218
01:22:45,301 --> 01:22:47,735
it'll be changed forever.

1219
01:22:47,737 --> 01:22:50,905
Death!

1220
01:22:50,907 --> 01:22:55,143
Death is transition to a new beginning.

1221
01:22:55,145 --> 01:22:57,077
Why?

1222
01:22:57,079 --> 01:22:58,946
Why do you have to come here

1223
01:22:58,948 --> 01:23:01,016
and fuck with me, man?

1224
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:04,585
Well...

1225
01:23:04,587 --> 01:23:07,621
there's a certain dignity in

1226
01:23:07,623 --> 01:23:12,626
playing avenging angel for that...

1227
01:23:12,628 --> 01:23:15,064
someone special.

1228
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:18,433
Sonny here is just a
threat to the investment.

1229
01:23:18,435 --> 01:23:21,169
You? You're nothing special.

1230
01:23:21,171 --> 01:23:24,073
No, you are the mind of the masses.

1231
01:23:25,242 --> 01:23:28,742
(clicks tongue)

1232
01:23:28,744 --> 01:23:30,379
(blows raspberry)

1233
01:23:31,847 --> 01:23:33,848
I'm the mind of the...

1234
01:23:33,850 --> 01:23:36,049
I'm the mind of the masses?

1235
01:23:36,051 --> 01:23:38,354
Mind of the masses.

1236
01:23:39,521 --> 01:23:41,391
All right.

1237
01:23:43,426 --> 01:23:45,395
I got here...

1238
01:23:46,829 --> 01:23:49,062
due to criminal tendencies.

1239
01:23:49,064 --> 01:23:50,599
Aw.

1240
01:23:53,203 --> 01:23:56,437
I never wanted to be a rocket surgeon or,

1241
01:23:56,439 --> 01:24:00,174
a brain scientist, I just
wanted good ol' crooked livin'

1242
01:24:00,176 --> 01:24:02,076
with a little bit of killer butt.

1243
01:24:02,078 --> 01:24:04,178
Mm-hm.

1244
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:07,281
What I'm doing here, is I
am getting kicked in the ass

1245
01:24:07,283 --> 01:24:10,451
due to lack of ambition
and I am being offered this

1246
01:24:10,453 --> 01:24:15,322
clean slate so long as I
believe that allowing you to...

1247
01:24:15,324 --> 01:24:19,794
flay me is the best way to do that.

1248
01:24:19,796 --> 01:24:21,662
Where am I going?

1249
01:24:21,664 --> 01:24:25,098
Where I'm going is, up in smoke.

1250
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:27,501
I'm gonna get the mind of the masses

1251
01:24:27,503 --> 01:24:30,440
higher than a motherfucker.

1252
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:39,582
You don't happen to have a light?

1253
01:24:42,252 --> 01:24:45,955
The world will be made in my image.

1254
01:24:47,222 --> 01:24:51,992
Even if I am the last spirit standing.

1255
01:24:51,994 --> 01:24:55,696
How the fuck do you
know all this shit, man?

1256
01:24:55,698 --> 01:24:59,099
Electroshock intuition.

1257
01:24:59,101 --> 01:25:01,736
But mostly...

1258
01:25:01,738 --> 01:25:04,638
I just make it all up.

1259
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,108
(snaps fingers)

1260
01:25:08,110 --> 01:25:11,480
(rock music) Ah!

1261
01:25:13,515 --> 01:25:16,384
You ready?

1262
01:25:16,386 --> 01:25:18,719
Okay, you can sit down and we'll talk

1263
01:25:18,721 --> 01:25:21,089
and we'll smoke this, come on.

1264
01:25:21,091 --> 01:25:22,925
Let's find a lighter.

1265
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:29,097
Okay okay okay, we were
talking, that was fine.

1266
01:25:30,132 --> 01:25:32,167
On the downbeat.

1267
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:38,171
Five.

1268
01:25:38,173 --> 01:25:39,374
Six.

1269
01:25:39,376 --> 01:25:40,842
Five six seven.
