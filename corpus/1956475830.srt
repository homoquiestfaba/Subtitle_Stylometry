00:01:27,627 --> 00:01:28,895
- Thanks, babe.
- Mm-hmm.

00:01:28,929 --> 00:01:30,763
- Thanks.
- Sure.

5
00:01:33,732 --> 00:01:35,702
So I thought through
every angle

6
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:37,971
and reverse-engineered
each option.

00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:39,172
If our primary is compromised,

8
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:40,572
I set up
two backside positions

00:01:40,606 --> 00:01:42,041
leading down the alley,

10
00:01:42,074 --> 00:01:44,443
where we jammed
those surveillance cameras.

I'm gonna have
two getaway cars positioned

12
00:01:48,113 --> 00:01:50,682
at the north end of the alley,
just off of Fifth Street,

13
00:01:50,715 --> 00:01:52,750
and one on the first floor
of the parking garage.

00:02:01,192 --> 00:02:03,194
Can I get you guys

You sure about this girl?

24
00:02:23,613 --> 00:02:25,582
She took me in
when no one else would.

25
00:02:26,883 --> 00:02:29,920
Trust me. She's been working
this game in this place,

26
00:02:29,953 --> 00:02:31,955
and she's got ties
all over the city.

27
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:36,093
She's our ace in the hole.

35
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:06,002
in which
the object of the game

36
00:05:06,035 --> 00:05:08,138
is to find the money card.

37
00:05:09,372 --> 00:05:10,939
The psychology of the con

38
00:05:10,974 --> 00:05:13,041
is to increase
the mark's confidence

39
00:05:13,075 --> 00:05:16,112
until he believes that
he has a special ability

00:05:16,146 --> 00:05:20,115
to cheat the dealer
and win easy money.

41
00:05:22,217 --> 00:05:26,289
The people involved in it
are known as "shills."

42
00:05:26,322 --> 00:05:29,958
They conspire with the mark
to cheat the dealer

43
00:05:29,992 --> 00:05:33,961
when, in fact, they're simply
conspiring with the dealer

44
00:05:33,995 --> 00:05:36,064
to cheat the mark.

49
00:06:22,074 --> 00:06:24,043
We'll have at least
a 30-minute window

00:06:24,076 --> 00:06:27,414
where all of this is clear.

00:06:27,447 --> 00:06:29,982
As long as the Sullivan brothers
don't fuck up their end,

00:06:44,495 --> 00:06:46,332
Could've happened to anyone.

57
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:49,901
Yeah, but it happened
to one of your guys.

His brother's a rising star.

All of these are clean.

You can dump 'em anywhere
once you finish your next job.

69
00:07:43,352 --> 00:07:45,489
None of 'em can be traced back.

and vouched for him.

00:17:05,489 --> 00:17:08,792
[ringing in ears]

182
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,399
Shit! Joe.

183
00:17:16,432 --> 00:17:18,568
Oh, shit, Joe!

184
00:17:18,601 --> 00:17:20,570
Oh, fuck, Joey.

185
00:17:29,846 --> 00:17:32,714
[siren approaching]

186
00:17:32,747 --> 00:17:33,915
Fuck.

187
00:17:33,949 --> 00:17:35,818
[groans]

188
00:17:45,861 --> 00:17:47,729
[engine starts]

189
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,139
[coughs]

190
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:03,868
[vibrating]

191
00:19:07,072 --> 00:19:09,941
- Can we do this in person?
- REX: <i>Where are you?</i>

192
00:19:09,974 --> 00:19:11,776
What the hell happened?

193
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:13,476
This was a cakewalk.

194
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,147
- In and out in 10.
- <i>Maybe...</i>

195
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:19,216
Maybe we lost track of a guard.

196
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,052
Bad call,
letting Joe run point.

197
00:19:22,086 --> 00:19:23,820
The guy's a jinx.

198
00:19:23,853 --> 00:19:25,856
You should've let me
buy him out!

199
00:19:27,524 --> 00:19:29,025
<i>It could've been
a solid payday,</i>

200
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:30,894
instead of this fucking mess
right here.

201
00:19:30,927 --> 00:19:32,195
<i>Security detail changed.</i>

202
00:19:32,228 --> 00:19:34,630
Some civvie
was playing Dirty Harry...

203
00:19:34,663 --> 00:19:37,233
- Where is the rest of the crew?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

204
00:19:37,267 --> 00:19:38,868
Got my bell rung.

205
00:19:38,902 --> 00:19:40,036
<i>You don't know.</i>

206
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,771
That crap ain't gonna cut it.

207
00:19:44,106 --> 00:19:45,942
He's your brother!

208
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,544
This is the kinda shit that
put him away the last time.

209
00:19:50,213 --> 00:19:51,880
Joe's dead.

210
00:19:53,581 --> 00:19:54,682
I'm sorry, Frank.

211
00:19:56,252 --> 00:19:59,088
You know,
this is still business.

212
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:03,624
What's the rest of the damage?

213
00:20:03,658 --> 00:20:04,792
I don't know
who's still in play.

214
00:20:04,826 --> 00:20:06,795
<i>What is it?</i>

215
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:08,896
<i>It went straight
by the numbers.</i>

216
00:20:08,931 --> 00:20:11,833
The alarm went off,
and we cleared the vault.

217
00:20:14,568 --> 00:20:15,903
Where's the package?

218
00:20:15,938 --> 00:20:17,005
<i>Joe had it.</i>

219
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:18,773
Then all hell broke loose.

220
00:20:18,806 --> 00:20:20,975
I got hit in the head
and got knocked out.

221
00:20:23,044 --> 00:20:24,511
How did you get out?

222
00:20:26,014 --> 00:20:29,816
We took the secondary getaway
on Fifth Street.

223
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,552
It doesn't answer my question.
Where's the case?

224
00:20:32,586 --> 00:20:33,820
I don't know, Rex.

225
00:20:35,188 --> 00:20:36,823
Probably whoever hit us has it.

226
00:20:36,857 --> 00:20:38,825
They knew exactly
where we were gonna be,

227
00:20:38,859 --> 00:20:41,194
then they left me there
to take the fall.

228
00:20:41,228 --> 00:20:44,897
It won't take long to ID Joe.

229
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,566
Where are you?

230
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,869
Clearing out of my safe house.

231
00:20:48,902 --> 00:20:50,603
What?

232
00:20:50,636 --> 00:20:52,272
Get to the holdup on Crenshaw.

233
00:20:52,305 --> 00:20:54,206
You were supposed
to do that anyway.

234
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,309
Look, if someone's
setting me up,

235
00:20:56,343 --> 00:20:59,145
then Crenshaw's probably
already compromised.

236
00:21:00,813 --> 00:21:03,848
Get your head on straight.

237
00:21:03,882 --> 00:21:07,119
Call me the second you hear
anything about the case.

238
00:21:07,153 --> 00:21:08,654
<i>You understand that?</i>

239
00:21:11,823 --> 00:21:13,825
[sighs]

240
00:21:20,932 --> 00:21:23,201
I got a guy on vice,
said the bank's a fucking mess.

241
00:21:23,234 --> 00:21:25,136
They shot the place up
pretty bad,

242
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,205
took out a bunch
of damn cops in the process.

243
00:21:28,273 --> 00:21:30,275
None of this
connects back to me.

244
00:21:30,308 --> 00:21:32,043
I'm on it.

245
00:21:32,976 --> 00:21:34,645
Cops aren't holding anyone,

246
00:21:34,678 --> 00:21:36,881
but Joe Sullivan's
on his way to the morgue.

247
00:21:36,915 --> 00:21:39,850
- Where's his brother?
- I just got off with Frank.

248
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:41,952
It's a rough break,
but he's a pro.

249
00:21:41,985 --> 00:21:43,287
Does he have the case?

250
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,922
He couldn't tell me
a goddamn thing.

251
00:21:47,258 --> 00:21:49,193
This isn't what I signed up for.

252
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:51,195
You've already made the deal
for the hardware.

253
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:53,930
Which was contingent on
the acquisition of that case.

254
00:21:53,963 --> 00:21:57,101
Now, without that,
all of this is worthless.

255
00:21:57,134 --> 00:21:59,769
I've never had a job
go down like this.

256
00:21:59,802 --> 00:22:02,705
It wasn't the crew or me.

257
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,374
It was the caper
that went sideways.

258
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:07,710
Who else was after this thing?

259
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,178
Besides us?

260
00:22:09,212 --> 00:22:11,914
Every law enforcement agency
in the country.

261
00:22:57,091 --> 00:22:59,193
Whiskey, neat.

262
00:23:08,768 --> 00:23:09,969
Mm.

263
00:23:11,504 --> 00:23:13,973
You drinking to forget?

264
00:23:14,007 --> 00:23:15,875
Drinking to my brother.

265
00:23:17,877 --> 00:23:20,246
I'm looking for
his girlfriend Claire.

266
00:23:25,985 --> 00:23:27,753
She's not here.

267
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:35,827
If she is here,
she's in danger.

268
00:23:40,532 --> 00:23:41,799
Upstairs.

269
00:23:43,502 --> 00:23:45,002
Thanks.

270
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:12,430
I don't have much cash.
Take it and get the fuck out.

271
00:24:12,463 --> 00:24:14,064
Frank?

272
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:17,134
Joe's dead.

273
00:24:17,168 --> 00:24:18,436
What?

274
00:24:18,469 --> 00:24:20,470
That can't be right.

275
00:24:20,503 --> 00:24:22,239
Shit.

276
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,974
Supposed to be
a really easy job.

277
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:26,776
What the hell happened?

278
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,812
Somebody shot him.

279
00:24:28,845 --> 00:24:30,513
What do we do?

280
00:24:33,482 --> 00:24:35,986
I can give you this cash.

281
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:37,886
For what?

282
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,024
Joey asked me to look out for
you in case shit went wrong.

283
00:24:43,992 --> 00:24:45,427
What happened in there?

284
00:24:47,129 --> 00:24:50,299
I don't know.
I don't know.

285
00:24:51,367 --> 00:24:53,835
I got knocked out.

286
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,036
But you got away.

287
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:56,804
I woke up next to a Dumpster,

288
00:24:56,838 --> 00:25:00,041
where we parked
the secondary getaway vehicle.

289
00:25:00,074 --> 00:25:01,509
But those ten minutes...

290
00:25:03,111 --> 00:25:04,579
gone.

291
00:25:04,612 --> 00:25:06,315
What were you after?

292
00:25:06,348 --> 00:25:07,282
Money?

293
00:25:07,315 --> 00:25:08,850
Some sort of metal case.

294
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:10,251
I don't even know
what was inside it.

295
00:25:10,285 --> 00:25:11,452
How can you not know
what's inside?

296
00:25:11,486 --> 00:25:13,854
It was just a job,
all right?

297
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,357
It paid well,
but it was just a job.

298
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:19,059
It's a bust anyway.
What difference does it make?

299
00:25:19,092 --> 00:25:20,827
It matters to me.

300
00:25:20,861 --> 00:25:23,497
That ten minutes
took away the life we had.

301
00:25:24,598 --> 00:25:26,900
Look, he asked me
to get you out.

302
00:25:26,933 --> 00:25:29,836
I can give you some money,
but we have to go.

303
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,004
Who else was there?

304
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:32,339
You met them.

305
00:25:32,372 --> 00:25:34,140
There were five of us
on the inside.

306
00:25:34,173 --> 00:25:35,909
One of 'em planned the outs.

307
00:25:35,942 --> 00:25:38,111
The outs?

308
00:25:38,145 --> 00:25:41,881
Escape routes, new identities,
that sort of stuff.

309
00:25:41,914 --> 00:25:44,383
Maybe one of them.
Can't you just...

310
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:47,086
- We're wasting time.
- What the hell are you doing?

311
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:49,188
We have to move.
Don't you understand?

312
00:25:49,221 --> 00:25:51,057
It's not safe for you here.

313
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,857
The cops are gonna be after
whoever's close to Joe.

314
00:25:52,891 --> 00:25:54,092
Now put this on.

315
00:26:09,007 --> 00:26:10,241
Is that who I think it is?

316
00:26:13,645 --> 00:26:15,547
Why would Rex
send his cleaner here?

317
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,349
Oh, fuck.

318
00:26:17,382 --> 00:26:19,184
Where's the back door
to this place?

319
00:26:19,217 --> 00:26:21,085
Through there.

320
00:26:21,118 --> 00:26:22,487
We gotta go. Now.

321
00:26:27,492 --> 00:26:30,194
My window to get to Crenshaw
has closed.

322
00:26:30,227 --> 00:26:32,429
Rex must think
I ambushed the deal.

323
00:26:32,463 --> 00:26:34,897
You got someplace else
to go outside of town?

324
00:26:34,931 --> 00:26:36,967
I've got a brother
that lives up in Minnesota.

325
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,503
Good. If anybody asks,
you've been there all week.

326
00:26:39,536 --> 00:26:41,305
Now get in.

327
00:26:46,043 --> 00:26:47,644
- [engine starts]
- Oh, shit, she's back!

328
00:26:47,678 --> 00:26:49,245
Get down, get down!

329
00:26:54,517 --> 00:26:56,185
All right.

330
00:27:03,593 --> 00:27:05,695
I didn't think
it would be so tight.

331
00:27:05,728 --> 00:27:08,231
My out's blown.

332
00:27:08,264 --> 00:27:10,065
We should get outta here.

333
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:18,073
Tell me we have eyes
on Baxter and Marshall.

334
00:27:18,106 --> 00:27:19,441
Still can't reach anyone,

335
00:27:19,474 --> 00:27:21,076
and Frank hasn't been
to Crenshaw.

336
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:22,943
Nothing?

337
00:27:28,517 --> 00:27:30,552
From this vantage point,
it looks like the cops

338
00:27:30,585 --> 00:27:33,087
have locked down
about six city blocks,

339
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,224
including
the secondary fallback.

340
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:40,461
Every cop in the country's
after this thing, right?

341
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:41,395
Right.

342
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:45,131
How do we know
they didn't tag the score?

343
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:46,600
Because if they did,

344
00:27:46,634 --> 00:27:49,236
then I doubt we'd be
standing here right now.

345
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:57,110
CLAIRE: What is this place?

346
00:27:57,143 --> 00:28:00,447
Joey designed secondary
escape routes for both of us.

347
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,148
His plan was foolproof.

348
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:04,551
If someone hijacked it,
it was one of us.

349
00:28:04,584 --> 00:28:06,553
So why are we here?

350
00:28:06,587 --> 00:28:08,755
Baxter was one of the guys
covering the lobby

351
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:10,022
this afternoon.

352
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,424
You think it was him?

353
00:28:12,425 --> 00:28:14,193
He's smarter than he looks.

354
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:16,095
And he always kept dirt
on everyone.

355
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:17,630
If this guy killed Joe,

356
00:28:17,664 --> 00:28:19,364
aren't you taking
an awful risk going in alone?

357
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:21,767
I can handle Baxter.
You stay put.

358
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:24,035
- Let me come with you.
- Not a chance.

359
00:28:24,068 --> 00:28:26,104
The only reason
I got roped into this

360
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:27,774
is because Joe needed a score

361
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:30,175
to prove that
he could still deliver.

362
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,543
Now lock the doors.

363
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:33,478
Like it's gonna help
in this neighborhood.

364
00:30:30,891 --> 00:30:32,425
- [gun cocks]
- Psst!

365
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:34,627
Jesus, man!

366
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,095
That sidearm for me?

367
00:30:37,263 --> 00:30:38,799
Just staying safe, man.

368
00:30:38,832 --> 00:30:41,167
How'd I know you weren't
gonna bring the five-oh?

369
00:30:42,301 --> 00:30:43,803
Anyone else here?

370
00:30:43,836 --> 00:30:45,203
No, it's just me, brother.

371
00:30:46,372 --> 00:30:50,643
Hey, I know you weren't tight,
but respects for Joe.

372
00:30:50,676 --> 00:30:53,211
It's all over the news.
We in some gnarly shit, Hoss.

373
00:30:54,512 --> 00:30:56,214
What the hell
happened back there?

374
00:30:56,247 --> 00:30:58,583
- We got a rat in the crew?
- Hey, we cool, man.

375
00:30:58,617 --> 00:30:59,852
I covered my post.

376
00:30:59,885 --> 00:31:01,853
It was all clear
till things went postal.

377
00:31:01,886 --> 00:31:03,788
What happened there
in the vault, huh?

378
00:31:03,822 --> 00:31:06,191
Joey and I were
ahead of the clock.

379
00:31:06,224 --> 00:31:07,826
You were the one
with eyes on Marshall.

380
00:31:07,859 --> 00:31:09,661
You tell me exactly
what you saw.

381
00:31:09,694 --> 00:31:11,796
Sitting on the guards,
when the fireworks started,

382
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,330
you know how he rolls.

383
00:31:13,364 --> 00:31:14,932
Charlie Bronson
had to check it out.

384
00:31:14,965 --> 00:31:16,835
- And Griffin?
- Trolling the security station.

385
00:31:16,868 --> 00:31:18,435
- Then what?
- I got the hell outta Dodge

386
00:31:18,469 --> 00:31:19,703
when the alarms chimed.

387
00:31:19,738 --> 00:31:21,405
Been here ever since.

388
00:31:21,438 --> 00:31:22,740
Griffin was supposed
to kill the alarms.

389
00:31:22,773 --> 00:31:24,875
Yeah, man,
but something tripped.

390
00:31:24,908 --> 00:31:26,710
After all these years,
I dodged every bullet.

391
00:31:26,744 --> 00:31:28,912
I wasn't gonna wait
for no cops.

392
00:31:28,946 --> 00:31:30,914
They were waiting for us
right out front.

393
00:31:31,982 --> 00:31:33,516
Shit! We got heat!

394
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:37,286
[alarm blaring]

395
00:31:37,321 --> 00:31:39,355
Baxter, it's a setup!
Bring 'em up!

396
00:31:44,494 --> 00:31:45,928
Damn! Let's go!

397
00:31:49,265 --> 00:31:51,199
Keep your faces down!

398
00:31:52,735 --> 00:31:54,536
[gunfire]

399
00:32:16,992 --> 00:32:18,627
We dumped the car
in the river,

400
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,261
and Marsh and I
went separate ways.

401
00:32:20,294 --> 00:32:21,930
I had my eye out
on the ball.

402
00:32:21,963 --> 00:32:24,665
You think Griff
or Marsh made a play?

403
00:32:24,699 --> 00:32:26,735
I won't know that
till I find 'em.

404
00:32:27,836 --> 00:32:29,737
Any idea where they're at?

405
00:32:31,906 --> 00:32:33,941
Can't help you there, dude.

406
00:32:33,974 --> 00:32:36,677
Why you camping here
instead of Crenshaw?

407
00:32:36,711 --> 00:32:38,713
This is my hood.
If we did get punked,

408
00:32:38,746 --> 00:32:40,715
the big kahuna
might send out Ivory,

409
00:32:40,748 --> 00:32:43,650
and I don't wanna be a part
of any of that shit.

410
00:32:43,683 --> 00:32:45,652
[phone chimes]

411
00:32:45,685 --> 00:32:48,655
That's probably Rex's boys
trying to squeeze me to come in.

412
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,765
Shit.

413
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,401
- Who is it?
- [lighter clicking]

414
00:33:03,902 --> 00:33:05,270
Is it Rex?

415
00:33:09,441 --> 00:33:10,743
Sorry, dude.

416
00:34:36,892 --> 00:34:38,359
CLAIRE: Frank!

417
00:34:38,393 --> 00:34:39,962
- [screaming]
- Shut the fuck up, man!

418
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:41,830
- Shoot him, Frank!
- Shut up.

419
00:34:41,863 --> 00:34:43,498
Drop it or I drop her.

420
00:34:45,499 --> 00:34:47,502
- Hey, Baxter.
- Huh?

421
00:34:47,535 --> 00:34:50,839
- You like dancing?
- What?

422
00:34:51,806 --> 00:34:53,674
Hope not.

423
00:34:54,641 --> 00:34:55,809
Oh, my God!

424
00:34:56,778 --> 00:34:58,847
- Shit.
- Damn it!

425
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,447
Frank, hurry!

426
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,882
I thought I told you
to stay in the car.

427
00:35:01,915 --> 00:35:04,818
- I heard shots!
- And what were you gonna do?

428
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,055
- My leg!
- Shut up!

429
00:35:07,088 --> 00:35:09,423
Help him up.
Get up now.

430
00:35:09,456 --> 00:35:12,092
- Help him up.
- Okay, okay.

431
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:14,460
[grunting]

432
00:35:14,493 --> 00:35:15,828
Let's go, come on.

433
00:35:18,098 --> 00:35:20,133
This was planned to perfection.

434
00:35:21,168 --> 00:35:22,568
It's all there.

435
00:35:23,536 --> 00:35:24,670
Everything.

436
00:35:25,771 --> 00:35:27,673
I gave you the best crew
money can buy.

437
00:35:27,707 --> 00:35:30,042
It's just a simple
fucking bank job,

438
00:35:30,076 --> 00:35:31,744
if you know what you're doing.

439
00:35:31,777 --> 00:35:34,080
Not just one bank.

440
00:35:34,113 --> 00:35:38,484
One branch, one location,
one vault.

441
00:35:39,819 --> 00:35:41,686
So why did we break into it?

442
00:35:43,622 --> 00:35:47,759
Twelve years ago, there was
this world-famous jewel thief

443
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:49,794
that stole what was
equivalent today

444
00:35:49,828 --> 00:35:51,663
to 30 million
in raw gemstones.

445
00:35:55,499 --> 00:35:57,969
Now, his fence
was told to stash it

446
00:35:58,003 --> 00:36:01,172
in one of those
safety deposit boxes,

447
00:36:01,206 --> 00:36:03,507
pending the sale of the merch.

448
00:36:08,479 --> 00:36:10,714
When the fence was killed for
shopping around the jewels...

449
00:36:15,685 --> 00:36:18,155
the thief fled
to a non-extradition country.

450
00:36:20,224 --> 00:36:21,225
Why now?

451
00:36:22,993 --> 00:36:25,461
The Mann Chandler Bank
was flooded a few weeks ago

452
00:36:25,495 --> 00:36:27,932
when the Ohio River overflowed.

453
00:36:27,965 --> 00:36:29,732
Now, their customers
were told to come in

454
00:36:29,766 --> 00:36:31,668
and collect their property,

455
00:36:31,701 --> 00:36:33,836
or their safety deposit boxes
would be moved

456
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,771
to a different location.

457
00:36:35,804 --> 00:36:38,841
Now, I was hired to bring in
the best crew to retrieve that,

458
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:41,878
since he couldn't
step foot onto U.S. soil.

459
00:36:41,911 --> 00:36:43,879
Who else knows about this?

460
00:36:43,912 --> 00:36:45,681
Look, I hired you
because I was told

461
00:36:45,714 --> 00:36:47,083
you didn't ask those questions.

462
00:36:47,116 --> 00:36:49,886
Your job was to tell
the fucking truth!

463
00:36:51,154 --> 00:36:52,721
Look, I can't wait any longer.

464
00:36:52,754 --> 00:36:54,856
Now, I know you and Frank
are tight and all,

465
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:58,894
but that case
buys a lot of loyalty.

466
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:00,228
But even more favors.

467
00:37:00,262 --> 00:37:03,664
He never gave me a reason
to doubt before.

468
00:37:03,698 --> 00:37:08,136
Everyone's got their price,
even Frank Sullivan.

469
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:11,839
And everyone's an asset,
until they're not.

470
00:37:18,746 --> 00:37:20,982
[groans]
Take it easy!

471
00:37:21,015 --> 00:37:23,284
Give me the real
or the next one's in your gut.

472
00:37:23,317 --> 00:37:25,919
I didn't do it, man.
We got history, I swear.

473
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,588
Then why did you try to kill me?

474
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:29,924
The alarm wasn't my fault,
man, okay?

475
00:37:31,058 --> 00:37:33,093
Griff got antsy.
When the shooting started,

476
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:35,662
I followed Marshall
out the door.

477
00:37:35,695 --> 00:37:38,832
M-Maybe we missed a teller
or a civvie had a phone.

478
00:37:38,865 --> 00:37:40,767
It just happened so fast.

479
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,169
Marshall was pinned down,
gunning away.

480
00:37:43,203 --> 00:37:45,771
I got a few shots off.

481
00:37:45,804 --> 00:37:47,841
I thought if he can make it out,
so can all of us.

482
00:37:47,874 --> 00:37:49,609
Bullshit.

483
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:50,844
- [click]
- God!

484
00:37:50,877 --> 00:37:52,045
Where's Griffin?

485
00:37:52,078 --> 00:37:54,146
I don't know, I don't know.

486
00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:55,581
[click]

487
00:37:55,614 --> 00:37:57,884
God!
I swear it's all I know.

488
00:37:57,917 --> 00:37:59,585
Did he hijack us?

489
00:38:00,919 --> 00:38:02,254
No, man.

490
00:38:02,287 --> 00:38:04,056
One out of four.
That's all you got left.

491
00:38:04,089 --> 00:38:05,857
When the alarm went off,
I got the hell out.

492
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:08,127
You know
I'm no good to you dead.

493
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,661
CLAIRE: I don't believe him.

494
00:38:09,695 --> 00:38:10,929
What's with her?

495
00:38:10,963 --> 00:38:13,132
You don't remember Claire?

496
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,767
Claire, you remember Baxter,
don't you?

497
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,103
Of course I do. Hardest part
about working in a bar

498
00:38:18,137 --> 00:38:21,572
is figuring out who's drunk
and who's just stupid.

499
00:38:21,606 --> 00:38:22,874
Tell us where they are,

500
00:38:22,907 --> 00:38:24,942
or I'll blow another hole
in you.

501
00:38:26,778 --> 00:38:28,112
It's too late, bro.

502
00:38:28,146 --> 00:38:30,081
They're probably
in the wind already.

503
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:33,617
[click]

504
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:34,718
Fuck!

505
00:38:34,751 --> 00:38:36,821
Where's Marshall?

506
00:38:36,854 --> 00:38:39,357
The guy's no sucker.
If you want to find him,

507
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:41,192
he's probably
where he's always at.

508
00:38:41,225 --> 00:38:42,926
How about Griffin?

509
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:45,829
I'd be surprised
if he's still in the state.

510
00:38:46,863 --> 00:38:48,232
[Claire shouting]

511
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,034
[click]

512
00:38:55,971 --> 00:38:57,674
That was close.

513
00:38:57,707 --> 00:38:59,309
Let's go.

514
00:39:04,747 --> 00:39:06,715
CLAIRE: What the hell
is going on, Frank?

515
00:39:06,749 --> 00:39:08,684
Someone's playing me.

516
00:39:08,717 --> 00:39:09,852
You heard what he said.

517
00:39:09,885 --> 00:39:12,388
Yeah, and I don't buy it.

518
00:39:12,421 --> 00:39:15,057
If Marshall killed Joe,
he could shoot you too, right?

519
00:39:15,091 --> 00:39:16,959
[sighs]
I don't know.

520
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,661
It's all a blur.

521
00:39:18,694 --> 00:39:20,096
I don't know what happened
when I was out,

522
00:39:20,129 --> 00:39:22,897
but when I came to,
Joey was already...

523
00:39:23,865 --> 00:39:24,899
He was what?

524
00:39:25,934 --> 00:39:27,136
He was gone.

525
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,405
Did he say anything?

526
00:39:29,438 --> 00:39:30,839
No.

527
00:39:32,307 --> 00:39:34,375
But he did ask me
to get you out

528
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:36,744
if something happened to him.

529
00:39:36,778 --> 00:39:39,347
He really looked up to you.

530
00:39:52,259 --> 00:39:54,328
CLAIRE: What the hell
is this place?

531
00:39:54,361 --> 00:39:56,263
FRANK: They call it
the Raw Deal.

532
00:39:56,296 --> 00:39:58,765
High stakes, no rules.

533
00:39:58,799 --> 00:40:01,168
They pay the police
to turn a blind eye.

534
00:40:01,201 --> 00:40:03,936
If Marshall's still here,
this is where he'll be.

535
00:40:05,371 --> 00:40:08,741
You wouldn't have another one
of those for me, would you?

536
00:40:08,774 --> 00:40:09,876
Yeah.

537
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:12,078
You take the driver's seat.

538
00:40:12,111 --> 00:40:14,847
If he is still here, we might
need to leave in a hurry,

539
00:40:14,881 --> 00:40:16,816
so be ready to rock and roll.

540
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:18,251
Got it.

541
00:40:18,285 --> 00:40:19,819
DOORMAN: Hey, Frankie,
how's it going?

542
00:40:19,852 --> 00:40:21,821
How's it going, bro?
You all right?

543
00:40:21,854 --> 00:40:23,889
Marshall upstairs?

544
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:26,024
- Up there playing.
- Cool.

545
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:41,439
[soft chatter]

546
00:40:47,145 --> 00:40:48,947
Need any drinks here?

547
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:52,317
Thanks.

548
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,360
Thanks, baby.

549
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:06,162
Hey, I'll take care
of you later, okay?

550
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:09,300
20 more to you, sir.

551
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:12,902
- 20.
- 20?

552
00:41:15,305 --> 00:41:17,208
I'm all in. Come on.

553
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:19,876
- I call.
- What have you got?

554
00:41:23,313 --> 00:41:25,814
All the way
down the hole here.

555
00:41:25,847 --> 00:41:26,950
Beginner's luck.

556
00:41:26,983 --> 00:41:28,451
Pair of jacks.

557
00:41:28,484 --> 00:41:30,887
- Kings and jacks.
- Read 'em and weep.

558
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:37,160
Ah, sorry about that.

559
00:41:37,193 --> 00:41:38,361
Beginner's luck.

560
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:40,862
Hold up.

561
00:41:42,497 --> 00:41:43,899
What do you got?

562
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:46,368
Three 10s.

563
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:47,903
Winner.

564
00:41:47,936 --> 00:41:49,438
What, are you two guys
working together?

565
00:41:49,471 --> 00:41:51,906
Hey, don't be a sore loser,
all right?

566
00:41:57,212 --> 00:41:59,047
Come on.
What's wrong with all of you?

567
00:41:59,081 --> 00:42:00,482
All you fishes done for the day?

568
00:42:00,515 --> 00:42:02,750
Who's next?
I'm bulletproof, baby!

569
00:42:06,087 --> 00:42:07,155
Hello, Marshall.

570
00:42:07,189 --> 00:42:08,923
Frank.

571
00:42:08,956 --> 00:42:11,158
That was some
fucked-up shit today.

572
00:42:11,192 --> 00:42:14,094
[chuckles]
Goddamn right.

573
00:42:14,127 --> 00:42:15,795
And here you are playing cards

574
00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:17,965
like you got
a pretty sweet hand.

575
00:42:17,999 --> 00:42:22,168
- Ah!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

576
00:42:22,202 --> 00:42:23,270
Easy.

577
00:42:25,305 --> 00:42:28,208
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
easy, easy.

578
00:42:28,242 --> 00:42:29,909
Easy.

579
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,147
Easy.

580
00:42:36,516 --> 00:42:38,985
Calm down, calm down,
calm down, calm down.

581
00:42:40,153 --> 00:42:41,521
I got your attention now?

582
00:42:45,457 --> 00:42:48,194
Why you fucking with
my sunny disposition, Frank?

583
00:42:48,228 --> 00:42:50,329
[chuckles]

584
00:42:50,362 --> 00:42:53,332
Everybody,
calm the fuck down!

585
00:42:53,365 --> 00:42:55,567
Jesus!

586
00:42:55,601 --> 00:42:57,836
Would you guys relax?
Relax, okay?

587
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:01,273
Put the guns down.
Just talking here.

588
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:06,879
See, these are my boys, Frank.

589
00:43:07,912 --> 00:43:09,180
These are my boys.

590
00:43:09,214 --> 00:43:11,015
And they've always been my out,

591
00:43:11,049 --> 00:43:13,017
and if you ask
any single one of them,

592
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:14,619
they'll tell you
the exact same thing.

593
00:43:14,652 --> 00:43:16,954
That I've been here all day,

594
00:43:18,056 --> 00:43:20,325
that I won some,

595
00:43:20,358 --> 00:43:21,992
I lost some,

596
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:25,262
but I'm still ahead of the game.

597
00:43:25,295 --> 00:43:29,066
I'm still ahead of the game.
What's your alibi?

598
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,135
I been busy hunting down
you sons of bitches.

599
00:43:32,169 --> 00:43:34,104
Now where's that goddamn case?

600
00:43:34,137 --> 00:43:36,105
Hey, I held up my end.

601
00:43:36,139 --> 00:43:38,442
No, that's not how
Baxter tells it.

602
00:43:39,677 --> 00:43:41,611
[laughs]
Baxter?

603
00:43:41,645 --> 00:43:44,980
Baxter waited till the end
to show his rat-ass face,

604
00:43:45,014 --> 00:43:46,515
and I got the scars to prove it.

605
00:43:46,549 --> 00:43:47,984
You left your post.

606
00:43:48,018 --> 00:43:50,354
I had those guards
wrapped tight.

607
00:43:50,387 --> 00:43:53,189
Swept the lobby two times.
Two times, Frank.

608
00:43:53,222 --> 00:43:54,957
And you and Joe
are running long,

609
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:57,093
and before I know it,
two cops are in my eyeline.

610
00:43:57,126 --> 00:43:59,328
- [gunshot]
- [alarm blaring]

611
00:44:53,045 --> 00:44:55,581
And I went out first because
those two fucking pussies

612
00:44:55,615 --> 00:44:57,084
couldn't hold their own.

613
00:44:59,218 --> 00:45:01,354
Who tripped the alarm?
The guard?

614
00:45:01,387 --> 00:45:02,722
Someone from the bank?

615
00:45:02,756 --> 00:45:04,724
I didn't miss
no motherfucking guards.

616
00:45:04,757 --> 00:45:07,494
What kinda Mickey Mouse job did
you and your brother cook up?

617
00:45:09,061 --> 00:45:10,196
Joe's dead.

618
00:45:11,497 --> 00:45:12,598
Oh.

619
00:45:13,866 --> 00:45:17,003
Well, then Griffin's laughing
his way to Mexico right now.

620
00:45:18,037 --> 00:45:20,071
- Griffin?
- Yeah, Griffin.

621
00:45:20,105 --> 00:45:22,675
That cocksucker showed up
when the shitstorm went down.

622
00:45:22,708 --> 00:45:24,709
Now I figured he was
just sick of waiting too.

623
00:45:24,743 --> 00:45:26,711
But as soon as
the alarm went off,

624
00:45:26,745 --> 00:45:28,714
he busted ass
right after you and Joe.

625
00:45:28,748 --> 00:45:30,415
- [alarm blaring]
- Keep your heads down!

626
00:45:30,449 --> 00:45:33,050
[alarm continues]

627
00:45:35,687 --> 00:45:38,623
And now I take this thing,

628
00:45:38,657 --> 00:45:40,659
with no payoff,

629
00:45:40,692 --> 00:45:44,161
and Griffin's playing us
like a bunch of chumps,

630
00:45:44,195 --> 00:45:46,664
and you're in here
trying to take care of me?

631
00:45:49,266 --> 00:45:51,435
You couldn't take care
of a two-dollar whore,

632
00:45:51,469 --> 00:45:54,472
you or your dead
fucking brother!

633
00:45:55,739 --> 00:45:58,242
Keep talking shit
about my brother.

634
00:45:58,275 --> 00:46:01,545
I'll blow a hole in that nasty
little fuckin' mouth of yours.

635
00:46:05,381 --> 00:46:09,487
Me and my boys had plans
after this, Frank.

636
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,120
And now...

637
00:46:12,355 --> 00:46:16,158
we are going to have
to take it out on you.

638
00:46:42,551 --> 00:46:44,753
Go! Go, go, go!

639
00:46:44,786 --> 00:46:46,053
[tires squealing]

640
00:46:46,087 --> 00:46:48,290
Get up! Get 'em!
Come on!

641
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:53,828
Oh, my God!
What happened back there?

642
00:46:53,861 --> 00:46:55,263
[gunfire continues]

643
00:46:56,664 --> 00:46:58,332
Are you okay?

644
00:46:58,366 --> 00:47:00,368
They're fuckin' dead!

645
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:02,370
Come on! Fuck!

646
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:04,705
Get up. Come on, grab the cash.
Let's get outta here.

647
00:47:12,612 --> 00:47:14,214
Come on, come on!

648
00:47:14,247 --> 00:47:16,650
Hello, boys.

649
00:47:16,683 --> 00:47:19,452
Haven't heard from you,
Marshall.

650
00:47:19,486 --> 00:47:22,222
Must've got lost
on your way to the Crenshaw.

651
00:47:24,256 --> 00:47:26,358
Yeah, we were just
heading there.

652
00:47:26,392 --> 00:47:29,195
Little late for that now,
don't you think?

653
00:47:31,631 --> 00:47:33,365
Fuck!

654
00:47:36,368 --> 00:47:38,370
Doesn't have to go down
this way, Ivory.

655
00:47:38,404 --> 00:47:40,673
That depends on you.

656
00:47:40,706 --> 00:47:43,175
- Anything yet?
- Nothing.

657
00:47:43,208 --> 00:47:46,544
[phone vibrating]

658
00:47:46,578 --> 00:47:48,614
IVORY: <i>I've got eyes
on Marshall.</i>

659
00:47:48,647 --> 00:47:50,349
Where was he?

660
00:47:50,382 --> 00:47:52,250
Holed up
down at the Raw Deal.

661
00:47:52,283 --> 00:47:55,587
Thought he was covering
his tracks with five-oh.

662
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,456
Hey, that's not
what was going on.

663
00:47:57,489 --> 00:47:58,824
We were just playing it cool.

664
00:47:58,857 --> 00:48:01,259
Did you hear that?

665
00:48:01,292 --> 00:48:03,127
Yeah, let's just
keep this simple.

666
00:48:03,161 --> 00:48:04,329
Go ahead.

667
00:48:04,362 --> 00:48:05,897
IVORY: <i>He's all ears.</i>

668
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:07,465
MARSHALL: <i>Look, man...</i>

669
00:48:07,498 --> 00:48:09,400
I don't care
what you have to say.

670
00:48:09,434 --> 00:48:11,569
Who's got the case?

671
00:48:11,603 --> 00:48:13,270
Baxter and Joe are dead.

672
00:48:13,303 --> 00:48:14,872
Me and Frank
don't have the case.

673
00:48:14,906 --> 00:48:17,375
<i>That means Griffin
did a snatch and grab.</i>

674
00:48:17,408 --> 00:48:18,810
You sure about that?

675
00:48:18,843 --> 00:48:20,745
Yeah, I busted my ass
to get out of there.

676
00:48:20,778 --> 00:48:22,846
<i>Cops were out front,
the alarm went off,</i>

677
00:48:22,879 --> 00:48:24,448
shit was fucking haywire,
all right?

678
00:48:24,481 --> 00:48:26,516
Nothing went according to plan.

679
00:48:29,186 --> 00:48:31,221
All the pieces were in position.

680
00:48:31,254 --> 00:48:32,288
That's all I know.

681
00:48:33,557 --> 00:48:35,791
Then I guess your markers
are getting called in.

682
00:48:42,298 --> 00:48:43,532
<i>Marker called.</i>

683
00:48:43,566 --> 00:48:45,334
Do you have any tracking
on Frank?

684
00:48:45,368 --> 00:48:47,370
I had eyes on him earlier.

685
00:48:47,403 --> 00:48:50,139
He's got someone with him,
a girl.

686
00:48:51,307 --> 00:48:52,541
Sanitize the site,

687
00:48:52,575 --> 00:48:55,210
so you can
lead this to the case.

688
00:48:55,243 --> 00:48:56,645
I'm on it.

689
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,335
Cops still don't know anything.

690
00:49:20,368 --> 00:49:22,369
They're scrambling
all over the city.

691
00:49:22,403 --> 00:49:26,407
Anyone else think
this isn't a big coincidence?

692
00:49:27,909 --> 00:49:29,778
Joe comes to town.

693
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:32,379
Now half the crew's dead,

694
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:34,715
and Frank's MIA?

695
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:38,485
[phone vibrates]

696
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:42,690
- Is that Ivory?
- Doesn't say.

697
00:49:42,723 --> 00:49:44,691
Let's play it back on this.

698
00:49:44,724 --> 00:49:47,661
ROBOTIC VOICE: <i>Follow these
directions carefully.</i>

699
00:49:47,695 --> 00:49:50,229
<i>Case is secure.</i>

700
00:49:50,263 --> 00:49:52,732
<i>Same deal as before.</i>

701
00:49:52,765 --> 00:49:54,934
<i>$500,000.</i>

702
00:49:56,301 --> 00:49:58,571
<i>10 p.m.</i>

703
00:49:58,604 --> 00:50:02,441
- <i>Place, TBD.</i>
- <i>[beeps]</i>

704
00:50:03,743 --> 00:50:05,911
Things are getting out of hand.

705
00:50:05,944 --> 00:50:08,681
It's time to wipe
the board clean.

706
00:50:08,715 --> 00:50:10,282
Liquidate everyone.

707
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,862
CLAIRE: Joe and I came up here
all the time.

708
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,931
You can see the whole city
from here.

709
00:50:27,999 --> 00:50:30,334
It's a different kinda jungle.

710
00:50:31,635 --> 00:50:34,271
This city hasn't worked out
like I planned, but...

711
00:50:35,506 --> 00:50:36,974
I don't quit easy.

712
00:50:40,811 --> 00:50:43,614
You don't seem like the guy
your brother told me about.

713
00:50:45,582 --> 00:50:49,687
Reputations have a way
of opening and closing doors.

714
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,857
I was done way before
ever taking this one on.

715
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:55,558
You really didn't know
what you were stealing?

716
00:50:55,592 --> 00:50:58,528
It's better that way.
Cleaner.

717
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:02,565
Joe said we'd be set.

718
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:05,034
Must be pretty big
for all this heat.

719
00:51:06,002 --> 00:51:07,637
He was betting it all.

720
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:10,540
He never listened to a word
I ever said.

721
00:51:12,574 --> 00:51:15,511
He couldn't have gotten on this
if you hadn't vouched for him.

722
00:51:15,544 --> 00:51:17,781
That's because he spent
seven years in the joint

723
00:51:17,814 --> 00:51:19,615
for a job he did in Phoenix.

724
00:51:20,917 --> 00:51:23,585
No one would touch him
after that.

725
00:51:23,619 --> 00:51:25,587
He just wanted
to be his own man.

726
00:51:25,621 --> 00:51:27,957
And he was desperate.
He needed this.

727
00:51:27,991 --> 00:51:30,359
Thing I don't understand is...

728
00:51:30,392 --> 00:51:32,895
I've done over a dozen
of these jobs with Rex.

729
00:51:32,928 --> 00:51:36,330
Nothing like this
has ever happened before.

730
00:51:36,364 --> 00:51:39,600
It must've been Griffin
on the double-cross.

731
00:51:39,635 --> 00:51:42,737
It's a pretty good way
to avoid splitting the take.

732
00:51:43,738 --> 00:51:45,472
Griff doesn't take chances.

733
00:51:46,741 --> 00:51:50,478
He'd be on his way
out of town by now.

734
00:51:50,511 --> 00:51:54,314
And there's only one guy who
knows how to get him a new ID.

735
00:51:55,149 --> 00:51:57,485
[engine starts]

736
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,589
WOMAN: Yeah, is that
what it is, huh?

737
00:52:02,622 --> 00:52:04,391
'Cause these tits were good
enough for you last night

738
00:52:04,424 --> 00:52:05,525
when I threw you $50.

739
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:07,694
Hey, I paid for the room
in full!

740
00:52:07,728 --> 00:52:10,097
- Not the whole night, darling.
- Oh, yeah? Was it?

741
00:52:10,131 --> 00:52:11,865
- Time's up. Get outta here.
- You got a problem with that?

742
00:52:11,898 --> 00:52:13,767
Time's up! Get outta here!

743
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:14,901
Cocksucker.

744
00:52:16,902 --> 00:52:19,506
Hold it with that,
tough guy.

745
00:52:22,008 --> 00:52:24,376
- Hi.
- Rooms are 69 a night

746
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:25,811
or 20 bucks an hour.

747
00:52:25,845 --> 00:52:28,048
I appreciate that,

748
00:52:28,081 --> 00:52:30,050
but I really need
to find my brother.

749
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:31,984
He's supposed to be
staying here.

750
00:52:32,017 --> 00:52:33,886
You see, he's gotten himself
into a bit of trouble and...

751
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:37,056
Love to help you, darling,
but lots of people come and go.

752
00:52:37,089 --> 00:52:38,858
I think what the lady's
trying to say is

753
00:52:38,891 --> 00:52:40,559
he'd be here to see the doc.

754
00:52:41,626 --> 00:52:42,660
The doc.

755
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:45,697
[sighs]

756
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,933
Did he have an appointment?

757
00:52:47,967 --> 00:52:50,702
[scoffs]
He doesn't make appointments.

758
00:52:50,735 --> 00:52:52,937
And you already knew that.

759
00:52:52,971 --> 00:52:55,006
He don't take
credit cards either.

760
00:52:56,607 --> 00:53:00,645
Well, fortunately for us,
I brought cash.

761
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,180
All right.

762
00:53:02,213 --> 00:53:04,648
Rate is $500
for an operating room.

763
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:25,668
Doc's been a bit busy today.
I need you to stay in room 307

764
00:53:25,701 --> 00:53:27,671
till his assistant
comes and get you.

765
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:31,774
- You got cameras in every room?
- Wait a minute.

766
00:53:31,807 --> 00:53:35,077
Now, that would violate
our clients' privacy, right?

767
00:53:38,781 --> 00:53:39,916
CLAIRE: Oh, my God!

768
00:53:44,552 --> 00:53:46,588
What the hell?

769
00:53:46,621 --> 00:53:49,491
I don't walk into a room unless
I know how I'm getting out.

770
00:53:54,663 --> 00:53:57,732
Room 309 and 311.
Let's go.

771
00:54:18,286 --> 00:54:20,888
- Step back.
- What if they start shooting?

772
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:24,725
Hey, Griff, that you?

773
00:54:24,758 --> 00:54:26,659
What do you think you're doing?
You can't come in like this.

774
00:54:26,693 --> 00:54:29,196
Take it easy with that, man.
I don't even know you.

775
00:54:30,164 --> 00:54:31,597
Hold this.

776
00:54:31,631 --> 00:54:33,167
What do you want me
to do with this?

777
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,934
- Watch the door.
- Okay.

778
00:54:34,968 --> 00:54:37,136
Busy day for you, huh?

779
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:38,839
For you or for me?

780
00:54:38,872 --> 00:54:40,940
It's pretty quiet.
Kinda dead, actually.

781
00:54:40,974 --> 00:54:43,009
[chuckles]

782
00:54:43,042 --> 00:54:44,877
Friend of mine
took a slug earlier.

783
00:54:44,911 --> 00:54:46,545
Maybe you worked on him?

784
00:54:46,578 --> 00:54:48,548
A lot of people come in here.

785
00:54:48,581 --> 00:54:50,616
I just do my job.
I don't ask questions.

786
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:51,651
Griffin O'Brien.

787
00:54:51,684 --> 00:54:53,252
Tall guy, kinda handsome?

788
00:54:53,286 --> 00:54:56,154
Yeah. Yeah, he said
it was ricochet.

789
00:54:56,188 --> 00:54:57,523
Where is he?

790
00:54:57,557 --> 00:54:59,192
You know I can't tell you that.

791
00:54:59,225 --> 00:55:00,259
Yeah?

792
00:55:04,997 --> 00:55:06,198
Eyes on him.

793
00:55:06,231 --> 00:55:09,268
- Hands up.
- Just be cool.

794
00:55:09,302 --> 00:55:12,004
He said if I disturbed him,
he'd shoot me.

795
00:55:12,037 --> 00:55:14,905
Then you better pray that
he's not feeling trigger-happy.

796
00:55:14,939 --> 00:55:17,074
Now open that goddamn door.

797
00:55:19,745 --> 00:55:20,979
[keys jingling]

798
00:55:21,013 --> 00:55:23,214
Mr. O'Brien?

799
00:55:23,248 --> 00:55:26,750
It's Dr. White.
I'd like to check your bandage.

800
00:55:26,784 --> 00:55:28,519
FRANK: Open it.

801
00:55:35,658 --> 00:55:36,793
Goddamn it.

802
00:55:36,826 --> 00:55:39,030
Gone with the wind.

803
00:55:39,063 --> 00:55:40,998
- Where?
- He got winged pretty bad.

804
00:55:41,032 --> 00:55:42,699
It took me two hours
to patch him up.

805
00:55:42,732 --> 00:55:44,200
No, no, no!

806
00:55:44,234 --> 00:55:46,236
I don't give a shit
what condition he was in.

807
00:55:46,269 --> 00:55:49,206
There's only a half a dozen
of you assholes in this city,

808
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,975
but you were the only one
who could provide a new out.

809
00:55:52,008 --> 00:55:53,276
CLAIRE: Frank!

810
00:55:53,309 --> 00:55:54,643
Hold on!

811
00:55:54,676 --> 00:55:56,678
[gunshots]

812
00:55:56,712 --> 00:55:57,781
Come on.

813
00:55:59,682 --> 00:56:01,750
- Jesus.
- What did you do?

814
00:56:01,784 --> 00:56:04,320
CLAIRE: He went for a gun.
I had to shoot him.

815
00:56:06,688 --> 00:56:08,058
I'm sorry.

816
00:56:11,693 --> 00:56:13,595
He had nothing to do
with you people.

817
00:56:14,729 --> 00:56:17,833
All right, enough games.
Where'd he go?

818
00:56:17,866 --> 00:56:20,035
Even if I knew,
I wouldn't tell you.

819
00:56:22,137 --> 00:56:23,938
Is that right?

820
00:56:23,971 --> 00:56:25,840
We'll just see about that.

821
00:56:26,874 --> 00:56:28,676
Sit down.

822
00:56:28,709 --> 00:56:29,944
Sit down!

823
00:56:34,749 --> 00:56:35,983
Put the mask on him.

824
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:40,054
Turn it on.

825
00:56:40,088 --> 00:56:42,123
That's it.
Now, nice deep breath, Doc.

826
00:56:43,957 --> 00:56:45,625
[coughs]

827
00:56:49,863 --> 00:56:51,898
You know why I'm here.

828
00:57:02,909 --> 00:57:04,710
Two inches thick!

829
00:57:17,423 --> 00:57:18,757
There you go.

830
00:57:18,791 --> 00:57:20,659
That's it. Now...

831
00:57:20,693 --> 00:57:22,728
I'm gonna ask again,
and you're gonna answer

832
00:57:22,761 --> 00:57:24,096
'cause, as we both know,

833
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:26,164
if we don't stop
pumping this with oxygen,

834
00:57:26,198 --> 00:57:29,667
you're gonna hallucinate like
a son of a bitch before you die.

835
00:57:29,702 --> 00:57:30,768
Now, where is he?

836
00:57:41,713 --> 00:57:43,815
- Where is he?
- [Doc groans]

837
00:57:43,848 --> 00:57:46,417
- Where? Where?
- Hold still.

838
00:57:46,451 --> 00:57:48,052
I sent him to Montreal!

839
00:57:48,086 --> 00:57:50,221
Montreal? Bullshit!

840
00:57:50,255 --> 00:57:51,289
[screams]

841
00:57:51,322 --> 00:57:52,689
Where is he?

842
00:57:57,194 --> 00:57:58,929
What's that? Shit.

843
00:58:00,198 --> 00:58:03,433
You see that woman?
You know who she is?

844
00:58:03,467 --> 00:58:05,269
You better start talking,

845
00:58:05,302 --> 00:58:08,105
or I guarantee you
she's gonna turn you inside out

846
00:58:08,138 --> 00:58:09,740
before she kills you.

847
00:58:09,773 --> 00:58:11,008
Montreal.

848
00:58:11,041 --> 00:58:12,209
Fuck it. Put it back on.

849
00:58:12,242 --> 00:58:14,143
No!
[groaning]

850
00:58:19,316 --> 00:58:20,816
Montreal!

851
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:22,151
What?

852
00:58:22,185 --> 00:58:24,754
The train to Montreal
stops in Toronto.

853
00:58:24,787 --> 00:58:26,755
After that, he's on his own.

854
00:58:26,788 --> 00:58:29,292
CLAIRE: The train for Montreal
stops in Toronto.

855
00:58:33,462 --> 00:58:35,797
Come on.
We gotta get outta here.

856
00:58:38,968 --> 00:58:41,237
Good luck, Doc.
Let's go.

857
00:58:51,313 --> 00:58:53,014
This way.

858
00:58:53,048 --> 00:58:56,318
There's a fire escape
through here. Come on.

859
00:59:00,821 --> 00:59:03,857
We gotta get as far away
from this place as we can.

860
00:59:04,925 --> 00:59:06,227
Come on.

861
00:59:08,096 --> 00:59:12,433
[heartbeats]

862
00:59:30,451 --> 00:59:31,784
No, wait.

863
00:59:37,055 --> 00:59:38,492
[phone vibrates]

864
00:59:38,525 --> 00:59:40,393
Talk to me.

865
00:59:40,426 --> 00:59:43,162
Looks like our boy Frank
might've been right.

866
00:59:43,196 --> 00:59:45,931
The doc did a patch job
on Griffin and sent him packing.

867
00:59:45,964 --> 00:59:47,199
Where?

868
00:59:47,232 --> 00:59:50,869
Train to Montreal,
boards 10:00.

869
00:59:50,902 --> 00:59:54,805
What? No matter what happens,
Griffin doesn't make that train.

870
00:59:54,839 --> 00:59:56,341
<i>Fuck him!</i>

871
00:59:57,542 --> 01:00:00,412
Hey, you need to go
send someone to intercept.

872
01:00:00,445 --> 01:00:02,080
He's left the underground.

873
01:00:02,114 --> 01:00:04,148
No way Frank's gonna
catch him anytime.

874
01:00:05,182 --> 01:00:06,884
We are totally off plan here.

875
01:00:06,917 --> 01:00:08,587
I'm not comfortable
with any of this.

876
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:12,356
There's always a degree of risk
when the stakes are high.

877
01:00:13,324 --> 01:00:15,359
This is making me insane.

878
01:00:15,393 --> 01:00:19,230
Go to the bar downstairs
and have a few drinks.

879
01:00:19,263 --> 01:00:23,167
Tequila. Try tequila.
It'll calm you right down.

880
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,435
That's what you need.

881
01:00:33,443 --> 01:00:36,413
[phone vibrating]

882
01:00:36,446 --> 01:00:40,183
HANNAH: <i>You are
all over the news, Richard.</i>

883
01:00:40,216 --> 01:00:43,086
This isn't
what you promised us.

884
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:45,355
<i>Look, we've got
bigger problems than that.</i>

885
01:00:46,389 --> 01:00:48,325
<i>You know that if the FBI</i>

886
01:00:48,358 --> 01:00:50,427
<i>figures out
what we were after,</i>

887
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:54,463
every one of us will be
on their most-wanted list.

888
01:00:54,496 --> 01:00:58,134
Look, our middle man is starting
to ask too many damn questions.

889
01:00:58,168 --> 01:01:00,202
<i>Tell him what he wants to hear,</i>

890
01:01:00,235 --> 01:01:03,472
just as long as he
completes the job.

891
01:01:03,505 --> 01:01:05,174
I think someone
from his crew is angling

892
01:01:05,207 --> 01:01:06,941
trying to get a payday
on this thing.

893
01:01:06,974 --> 01:01:08,377
<i>Then what do we need him for?</i>

894
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:11,146
Clock is ticking.

895
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:14,882
Make the deal
with whoever has it.

896
01:01:14,916 --> 01:01:16,317
Right.

897
01:01:16,351 --> 01:01:19,154
And you'll live
to steal another day.

898
01:01:29,664 --> 01:01:31,566
MAN ON P.A.:
<i>Your Cincinnati rep</i>

899
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:36,336
<i>reminds you that all premises

01:01:49,383 --> 01:01:51,118
<i>The Cincinnati
Police Department</i>

901
01:01:51,151 --> 01:01:53,453
<i>reminds you to keep
your luggage with you.</i>

902
01:01:53,487 --> 01:01:56,255
I thought I told you
to stay in the car.

903
01:01:56,288 --> 01:01:58,924
Like you can search
this whole station by yourself.

904
01:01:58,959 --> 01:02:01,595
Not that you'd listen.

905
01:02:01,628 --> 01:02:05,030
Who knew so many people
still took the train?

906
01:02:05,064 --> 01:02:08,167
CLAIRE: Didn't he say
his destination's for Toronto?

907
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,936
It's a stopover
on his way to Montreal.

908
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:13,272
These are all end of the line.

909
01:02:13,305 --> 01:02:15,641
The next one
leaves in an hour.

910
01:02:15,674 --> 01:02:17,475
Platform four.

911
01:02:17,509 --> 01:02:19,245
Over there.

912
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:22,247
<i>Cardinal line
now arriving on track three.</i>

913
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,048
See these folks?

914
01:02:24,082 --> 01:02:27,419
Employees get to ride for free.
No more paper trail.

915
01:02:29,422 --> 01:02:31,289
If Griffin wanted to blend in,

916
01:02:31,322 --> 01:02:33,091
all he'd have to do
is get one of those uniforms.

917
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:37,361
Oh, shit.

918
01:02:37,394 --> 01:02:39,197
What if he's already
on the train?

919
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:41,166
No. It's way too early.

920
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:43,535
He'd jump on
at the last minute.

921
01:02:44,769 --> 01:02:46,370
I got an idea.

922
01:02:48,038 --> 01:02:49,541
- I'm sorry...
- Excuse me!

923
01:02:49,574 --> 01:02:51,341
CLAIRE: It's important.

924
01:03:09,058 --> 01:03:11,060
Excuse me,
I really need your help.

925
01:03:11,093 --> 01:03:14,330
My son just got away from me,
and I don't know where he went.

926
01:03:14,363 --> 01:03:16,432
I lost my son.
I can't find him.

927
01:03:16,466 --> 01:03:18,702
His name is Griffin.
He's eight years old.

928
01:03:18,735 --> 01:03:21,170
Calm down and tell me
where you saw him last.

929
01:03:24,674 --> 01:03:26,575
He's wearing jeans
and a blue jacket.

930
01:03:43,358 --> 01:03:44,593
He was over there.

931
01:03:44,626 --> 01:03:46,360
Okay.

932
01:03:48,129 --> 01:03:50,164
ATTENDANT: <i>May I have
your attention, please?</i>

933
01:03:50,198 --> 01:03:52,132
<i>We're looking

934
01:03:52,166 --> 01:03:54,435

935
01:03:54,468 --> 01:03:56,537

01:03:59,541 --> 01:04:00,574
<i>Thank you.</i>

939
01:04:03,777 --> 01:04:06,279
I got you,
you son of a bitch.

940
01:04:12,486 --> 01:04:14,387
Oh, there he is.
I see him.

941
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:16,122
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

942
01:04:19,325 --> 01:04:22,295
Ladies' room. Move.

943
01:04:25,498 --> 01:04:26,533
Don't say a word.

944
01:04:28,101 --> 01:04:30,570
Let's keep it simple
this time.

945
01:04:30,603 --> 01:04:32,472
Ivory, you got the wrong idea.

946
01:04:32,505 --> 01:04:35,474
Really? 'Cause I saw
what you did to Baxter.

947
01:04:35,507 --> 01:04:39,244
You made quite a mess,
and I had to torch the place,

948
01:04:39,278 --> 01:04:41,681
and now Rex is in a real jam
because of you.

949
01:04:41,714 --> 01:04:43,448
I got cracked in the skull.

950
01:04:43,482 --> 01:04:46,518
Do you know how crazy
that shit sounds, Frank?

951
01:04:46,552 --> 01:04:49,254
Straight up, you thought
you'd get away with it?

952
01:04:49,288 --> 01:04:51,256
[phone vibrating]

953
01:04:52,491 --> 01:04:54,860

I can't believe
you're considering this.

959
01:05:16,146 --> 01:05:18,316
What other option
do you think we have?

960
01:05:18,349 --> 01:05:21,384
Have you ever considered
that we could be getting set up?

961
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:23,253
That could be the feds
for all we know.

962
01:05:23,286 --> 01:05:26,189
I doubt the feds
are really that smart.

963

01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:35,531
We're at the station.

967
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:43,873
You're on speaker.

968
01:05:43,907 --> 01:05:45,841
You didn't report in.

969
01:05:45,874 --> 01:05:48,344
Now you're taking down
your own guys?

970
01:05:49,411 --> 01:05:51,780
One of us is bad,
and it ain't me.

971
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:54,917
I'm just trying
to get even for Joe,

972
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:56,919
get back what we set out for.

<i>Even if you're being straight,

975
01:06:02,958 --> 01:06:05,627
It didn't go down that way.

976
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:07,795
Come clean,
or Ivory's gonna take you apart,

977
01:06:07,829 --> 01:06:09,397
piece by piece.

978
01:06:10,766 --> 01:06:12,734
<i>I don't wanna see that.</i>

979
01:06:12,767 --> 01:06:14,502
Look, Griff has it.

980
01:06:14,535 --> 01:06:17,270
It has to be him.
He's the only one left.

981
01:06:17,304 --> 01:06:20,541
I had eyes on him until
your cleaner brought me in here.

982
01:06:21,743 --> 01:06:23,343
Check his burner.

983
01:06:27,914 --> 01:06:29,182
Got it.

984
01:06:29,216 --> 01:06:31,585
Check the last message he sent.

985
01:06:33,754 --> 01:06:34,821
Nothing.

986
01:06:34,855 --> 01:06:36,456
If I don't get the goods,

987
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:39,760
I have no problem walking away
with loose ends.

988
01:06:39,793 --> 01:06:41,862
That means you and your girl.

989
01:06:41,895 --> 01:06:44,563
Are you fucking kidding me?

990
01:06:45,698 --> 01:06:47,566
She has nothing
to do with this.

991
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,536
Not from where I'm standing.

992
01:06:49,569 --> 01:06:51,270
<i>You're a tough mick, Frank.</i>

993

<i>Squeezing you
might be a waste of time.</i>

994

It doesn't mean
that I'm not gonna give it

995
01:06:56,676 --> 01:06:58,244
the old college try.

996
01:06:58,277 --> 01:07:00,346
Griff was making his way
down onto the platform.

997
01:07:00,379 --> 01:07:02,415
If he sees Ivory,
he's gonna bolt.

998
01:07:02,448 --> 01:07:04,282
<i>Send me in there.
I can flush him out.</i>

Let's load 'em up.
We're rolling out of this place.

1003

What the hell do you think
you're doing?

1004
01:07:38,783 --> 01:07:41,019
Careful, Richard.

1005
01:07:41,052 --> 01:07:44,521
Be very careful.

01:07:47,356 --> 01:07:49,593
For fuckin' Frank Sullivan.

1008

You've already paid me
$500,000 for the crew.

1009
01:07:54,664 --> 01:07:58,635
If those jewels are worth
$30 million on the black market,

1010
01:07:58,669 --> 01:08:01,537
then I am the best fence
in town.

01:08:09,046 --> 01:08:12,314
Hey, what do I need you for?

1012
01:08:17,786 --> 01:08:20,723

Ivory's got a gun

When I go after Griffin,
you get through that door,

Heat's coming down,

Why, Griff?
Why'd you do it?

01:11:55,627 --> 01:11:57,128
As far as I'm concerned,
it was a bust.

1057
01:12:05,770 --> 01:12:07,638
You were in control
of the alarm system.

1058
01:12:07,671 --> 01:12:09,674
I didn't trigger
the fucking thing.

1059
01:12:11,676 --> 01:12:13,778
Soon as I came out
of the security room,

1060
01:12:13,812 --> 01:12:14,879
the cops were already there.

1061
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:16,847
We were fucking set up, Frank!

1062
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,717
I went out the back garage.

1063
01:13:02,191 --> 01:13:03,226
[gun cocks]

1064
01:13:03,259 --> 01:13:04,960
Drop the gun, Frank.

1065
01:13:13,101 --> 01:13:14,169
Drop it.

1066

1067

Oh, we were family, man.

1069
01:13:26,381 --> 01:13:29,151
Marshall? Baxter?

1070
01:13:29,184 --> 01:13:31,852
Both of those motherfuckers
tried to kill me.

1071
01:13:31,886 --> 01:13:33,621
They kept pointing
the finger at you.

1072
01:13:33,654 --> 01:13:34,955
How the fuck was it
supposed to be me

1073
01:13:34,989 --> 01:13:36,791
if I was still in
the fucking security room

1074
01:13:36,824 --> 01:13:38,192
when you came out of the vault?

1075
01:13:38,225 --> 01:13:39,794
I got cracked
in the back of the head,

1076
01:13:39,827 --> 01:13:41,262
I woke up,
and Joe's dead next to me.

1077
01:13:41,295 --> 01:13:43,798
Who else is it gonna be?
You're the last man!

1078
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:49,170
Joey's dead?

1079
01:13:51,205 --> 01:13:53,006
You didn't know.

1080
01:13:55,175 --> 01:13:56,309
You didn't know.

1081
01:13:58,078 --> 01:13:59,846
Shit, I'm sorry, Frank.

1082
01:13:59,879 --> 01:14:02,082
I'll be a son of a bitch.

1083
01:14:05,251 --> 01:14:08,621
If it's not you, then who?

1084
01:14:10,023 --> 01:14:12,258
What the fuck happened, man?

1085
01:14:12,292 --> 01:14:14,394
[gunshots]

1086
01:14:14,427 --> 01:14:17,963
Jesus Christ! Griffin!
Griffie!

1087
01:14:19,798 --> 01:14:21,867
Frank.

1088
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:24,169
Don't even think about it.

1089
01:14:26,038 --> 01:14:27,705
Now move.

1090
01:14:32,311 --> 01:14:33,345
Over there.

1091
01:14:34,946 --> 01:14:36,013
Easy.

1092
01:14:38,817 --> 01:14:40,818
You got what you want.

1093
01:15:08,044 --> 01:15:10,147
I don't even know what it is.

1094
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:12,382
This isn't gonna go down
the way you want it to, Frank.

1095
01:15:12,415 --> 01:15:13,849
Where is it?

1096
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:15,017
Fuck.

1097
01:15:18,955 --> 01:15:21,957
You'll never know
if you shoot me.

1098
01:15:25,361 --> 01:15:26,694
[gunshots]

1099
01:15:32,768 --> 01:15:34,069
[chuckles]

1100
01:15:36,338 --> 01:15:38,373
For once, I'm glad
you didn't listen.

1101
01:15:38,406 --> 01:15:40,476
Try to stay focused, Frank.

1102
01:15:40,509 --> 01:15:42,944
You Sullivan boys are saps.

1103
01:15:45,213 --> 01:15:47,748
Must run in the family.

1104
01:15:48,917 --> 01:15:50,486
You gotta be shittin' me.

1105
01:15:50,519 --> 01:15:54,355
All wrapped up,
neat with a bow.

1106
01:15:54,389 --> 01:15:57,791
But you couldn't leave
well enough alone.

1107
01:15:57,824 --> 01:16:00,128
Gotta give it to you though.

1108
01:16:00,161 --> 01:16:05,132
All I had to do was point you
in the right direction

1109
01:16:05,165 --> 01:16:07,234
and squeeze.

1110
01:16:09,404 --> 01:16:12,005
[glass shatters]

1111

[ticking]

1112
01:16:17,043 --> 01:16:18,946
Why?

1113
01:16:18,979 --> 01:16:20,814
You'd have plenty
with Joe's share.

1114
01:16:20,847 --> 01:16:22,516
His share?

1115
01:16:22,549 --> 01:16:25,818
500 grand doesn't begin
to cover the markers he owed.

1116
01:16:26,919 --> 01:16:29,990
You've been playing me
this whole time.

1117
01:16:30,023 --> 01:16:33,893
I did save your ass
from Ivory, didn't I?

1118
01:16:33,926 --> 01:16:36,295
I just didn't expect you
to come calling earlier today.

1119
01:16:36,329 --> 01:16:38,464
But I rode along,

1120
01:16:38,497 --> 01:16:41,434
watched you hunt down
the rest of the guys.

1121
01:16:42,401 --> 01:16:44,036
Let's settle up, okay?

1122
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:45,770
Your money's no good here.

1123
01:16:45,804 --> 01:16:46,972
Thanks.

1124
01:16:49,108 --> 01:16:50,842
It was ours.

1125
01:16:50,875 --> 01:16:53,945
He was giving it all away
with his stupid even split.

1126
01:16:53,979 --> 01:16:55,880
So I cut it my way.

1127
01:16:55,914 --> 01:16:58,883
Joe told me whoever delivered
the case at the end of the day

1128
01:16:58,917 --> 01:17:01,419
gets the full 500 grand.

1129
01:17:01,453 --> 01:17:04,189
How'd you know
which out we'd take?

1130
01:17:04,222 --> 01:17:06,391
A girl like me,
I'd heard about Joe's reputation

1131
01:17:06,424 --> 01:17:08,392
for always chasing
the big score.

1132
01:17:08,425 --> 01:17:10,328
Even when he worked
all the angles,

1133
01:17:10,362 --> 01:17:11,895
the chips never fell his way.

1134
01:17:13,398 --> 01:17:15,099
OPERATOR:
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

1135
01:17:15,132 --> 01:17:16,333
There's an armed robbery
in progress

1136
01:17:16,367 --> 01:17:18,369
at the Mann Chandler Bank
downtown.

1137
01:17:18,402 --> 01:17:21,038
Please hurry.
They just shot my manager.

1138
01:17:22,373 --> 01:17:25,142
[alarm blaring]

1139
01:17:25,175 --> 01:17:28,077
[siren wailing]

1140
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:33,182
Charlie 326, show me arrival
and hold the air.

1141
01:17:33,217 --> 01:17:35,318
Hey, we got a report
of shots fired,

1142
01:17:35,351 --> 01:17:36,819
and we are not waiting.

1143
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,556
JOE: Fuck this.

1144
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:41,558
Let's clear the area
and go straight to Claire's.

1145
01:17:41,592 --> 01:17:43,893
That wasn't part of the plan.

1146
01:17:43,926 --> 01:17:45,994
I'm not trusting anything
we had set up with Rex.

1147
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:48,464
Let's get to Claire and
get the fuck out of the city.

1148
01:17:49,365 --> 01:17:51,267
- Fuck.
- [glass shatters]

1149
01:17:51,301 --> 01:17:54,304
- Get over there.
- What the fuck are you doing?

1150
01:17:54,337 --> 01:17:56,938
- Toss me the case.
- We don't have time for this!

1151
01:17:56,972 --> 01:17:59,075
I will not hesitate
to kill him.

1152
01:17:59,108 --> 01:18:01,243
Now throw me the case.

1153
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:02,978
Jesus.

1154
01:18:08,115 --> 01:18:10,552
The key. Where's the key?
It's no good without the key.

1155
01:18:10,585 --> 01:18:12,621
- I don't have the key.
- Bullshit!

1156
01:18:12,654 --> 01:18:15,156
You worked it all out,
every detail.

1157
01:18:15,189 --> 01:18:17,058
I don't have it.
It wasn't part of the plan.

1158
01:18:17,091 --> 01:18:18,125
Can he open this?

1159
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:19,528
I brought you in on this thing.

1160
01:18:19,561 --> 01:18:22,963
For pennies on the dollar, baby.
No, thanks.

1161
01:18:22,997 --> 01:18:25,499
Now tell me, can your brother
open this or not?

1162
01:18:31,105 --> 01:18:33,207
You greedy bitch.

1163
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:36,009
I wasted 10 years of my life
in that bar.

1164
01:18:36,042 --> 01:18:37,410
And for what?

1165
01:18:37,444 --> 01:18:39,280
A finder's fee
every time guys like you

1166
01:18:39,313 --> 01:18:40,880
took down a big score?

1167
01:18:46,186 --> 01:18:47,320
Everything good?

1168
01:18:47,354 --> 01:18:49,923
Everything's perfect.

1169
01:19:33,197 --> 01:19:36,200
I just didn't count on
you surviving.

1170
01:19:36,234 --> 01:19:39,470
But I figured I could always
use someone to help me

1171
01:19:39,504 --> 01:19:41,172
cover my tracks.

1172
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:44,509
The big kahuna
would send out Ivory,

1173
01:19:44,542 --> 01:19:47,110
and I don't wanna be
a part of any of that shit.

1174
01:19:52,182 --> 01:19:55,519
It's probably Rex's boys
trying to squeeze me to come in.

1175
01:19:57,287 --> 01:20:00,123
Sorry, baby.
It's a bitter little world.

1176
01:20:00,157 --> 01:20:03,226
Why didn't you just shoot me
when you had the chance?

1177
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:06,195
Never walk into a place you
don't know how to get out of.

1178
01:20:06,228 --> 01:20:07,963

- Frank!
- Hold on!

I'm not going
to ask you again.

1188

- Jesus, like 30 minutes ago.
- Where?

1189
01:20:30,286 --> 01:20:32,521
I don't know. All I heard was
something about Union Station,

and that's all I know.

1191
01:20:38,326 --> 01:20:40,462
- Jesus.
- What did you do?

1192
01:20:40,495 --> 01:20:42,397
He went for a gun.
I'm sorry.
