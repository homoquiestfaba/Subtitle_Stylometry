{\an5}Eh, my name is
Charlie McCarthy, what's yours?

00:00:05,023 --> 00:00:07,406
<i>- Vicky.
- Oh, it's cute.</i>

3
00:00:07,484 --> 00:00:10,822
<i>- Charlie?
- Oh, Vicky, Mr. Bergen. Bergen, Vicky.</i>

4
00:00:10,892 --> 00:00:13,007
<i>- How do you do.
- How do you do.</i>

5
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:16,272
You know ventriloquism's always
fascinated me.- It has? - Hm!

6
00:00:16,311 --> 00:00:18,162
Well, I'll be glad to
explain it to you.

7
00:00:18,209 --> 00:00:20,035
I'd love to know, but,
really I must run...

8
00:00:20,036 --> 00:00:22,675
<i>Oh, please stay.
It'll just take a minute.</i>

9
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:25,747
<i>Here, all right.
Well, ventriloquism...</i>

10
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:28,595
<i>It starts here, goes up here.</i>

11
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:31,487
- And it comes out here.
- It comes out there.

12
00:00:31,557 --> 00:00:34,635
Tell me how do you talk
without moving your lips?

13
00:00:34,698 --> 00:00:37,127
Eh... it's... well...

14
00:00:37,497 --> 00:00:39,878
May I have your hand?

15
00:00:41,993 --> 00:00:44,864
<i>Now you can feel the
muscles contract</i>

16
00:00:44,889 --> 00:00:46,399
<i>in my vocal chords.</i>

17
00:00:46,424 --> 00:00:48,684
- Vocal chords?
- Yes... oh, yes.

18
00:00:48,717 --> 00:00:50,988
- Yes.
- Like this.

19
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:54,813
You're lovely.
<i>Did that come out of me?</i>

20
00:00:54,838 --> 00:00:57,491
<i>I'm a little confused...
you're talking.</i>

21
00:00:58,038 --> 00:01:00,724
<i>Can you throw your voice
just anywhere?</i>

22
00:01:00,785 --> 00:01:02,668

C-can't you speak?

49
00:04:24,173 --> 00:04:27,226
Should I put you back
in your case?

50
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:31,071
OK, I'm gonna put you
back in your box.- No!

51
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,513
So, you can speak.

52
00:04:38,637 --> 00:04:40,805
Why aren't you speaking?

53
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,330
You're the worst vetriloquist
I've ever seen!

54
00:04:45,804 --> 00:04:48,962
It's my first time
working with a dummy.

55
00:04:49,202 --> 00:04:51,585
Who are you calling a dummy?

56
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,340
Oh, sorry.

57
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,990
Let me ask you something.

58
00:04:57,127 --> 00:04:58,594
What?

59
00:04:58,921 --> 00:05:00,656
Come here.

60
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:03,430
Come here.

61
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:05,516
Are you a retard?

62
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,306
No!

63
00:05:07,472 --> 00:05:10,942
I mean... some people
might think that.

64
00:05:11,263 --> 00:05:13,551
You can count me in.

65
00:05:14,164 --> 00:05:15,889
That's not very nice.

66
00:05:15,922 --> 00:05:17,818
Boo-hoo!

67
00:05:20,244 --> 00:05:22,170
I made blintzes!

68
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:26,619
What is that?
Oh, very strange, Steven.

69
00:05:26,652 --> 00:05:28,454
Do you want a cheese blintz?

70
00:05:28,506 --> 00:05:29,890
No.

71
00:05:29,947 --> 00:05:33,519
Ah... Lou,
come here look at this.

72
00:05:33,544 --> 00:05:34,627
Mom!

73
00:05:34,652 --> 00:05:36,166
Oh, great!

74
00:05:36,194 --> 00:05:38,689
Just what we need,
another mouth to feed.

75
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,515
<i>Wha? What's happening?</i>
Can I...?

76
00:05:41,893 --> 00:05:43,861
OK, Steven.

77
00:05:44,446 --> 00:05:46,957
You're such a loser!

78
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:54,923
And in the book it says

79
00:05:54,948 --> 00:05:57,119
we should get to know
each other, a bit.

80
00:05:57,153 --> 00:05:59,969
I think we should have a very,

81
00:06:00,508 --> 00:06:03,150
y'know, open relationship.

82
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:05,599
- Shut up!
- OK.

83
00:06:48,754 --> 00:06:52,016
Steven, I'm making pancakes!

84
00:06:53,593 --> 00:06:55,726
Not at the table, Lou!

85
00:06:55,794 --> 00:06:56,961
Why not?

86
00:06:57,056 --> 00:07:00,276
- Morning!
- I was hoping you were Steven.

87
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,369
How do you feel, honey?

88
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,628
I'm nauseated and
my neck is killing me.

89
00:07:04,653 --> 00:07:06,544
You're probably just depressed, dear.

90
00:07:06,617 --> 00:07:08,593
- Mom, can I have the car today?
- STEVEN!!

91
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,529
<i>You think we could not
yell today, please?</i>

92
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:13,607
I'm starting the S.S. Paulina.

93
00:07:13,608 --> 00:07:15,859
The Krauts tried to sink'er 3 times.

94
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,528
- Couldn't do it.
- That's great, dad.

95
00:07:17,553 --> 00:07:20,286
- Mom please...
- The pancakes are gonna be cold.

96
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,685
Those aren't even pancakes,
they're blintzes.

97
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,466
Well what do you think
pancakes are?

98
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:26,660
Your mother manages to make
everything look like a blintz.

99
00:07:26,677 --> 00:07:27,843
Good morning!

100
00:07:27,857 --> 00:07:29,943
- Can I have the car today?
- We'll see.

101
00:07:29,944 --> 00:07:31,194
I'm quitting my job.

102
00:07:31,195 --> 00:07:34,045
It's really important.
You know the Freed wedding.

103
00:07:34,098 --> 00:07:36,420
- OK honey, we'll see.
- What do you mean “we'll see“?

104
00:07:36,484 --> 00:07:39,644
- Can I have the car or not?
- Fern, it's a yes or no question, alright?

105
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:41,115
- Thank you!
- I'm quitting my job.

106
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:42,466
I have errands to run.

107
00:07:42,491 --> 00:07:44,802
<i>Well, I only need it for
an hour and a half.</i>

108
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:46,569
Tell you what, I'll have
it back by 3 o'clock.

109
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,779
OK, dear.

110
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,883
Is that OK, yes I can have
the car or OK, no I can't?

111
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,679
Oh my God...

112
00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:54,787
Your fiancé spent
the night in jail.

113
00:07:54,788 --> 00:07:55,865
What?

114
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,857
Right here, in the Police Report.

115
00:07:59,877 --> 00:08:02,463
Drunk and disorderly,
that's my boy!

116
00:08:02,464 --> 00:08:03,973
<i>Let's see that.</i>

117
00:08:05,717 --> 00:08:09,354
Well, serves him right.
Hope you rot there. Fucking loser!

118
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,638
<i>Heidi!</i>

119
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,067
That loser was almost
your husband.

120
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,552
Why can't you get it into
your head he's a psycohpath?

121
00:08:16,577 --> 00:08:18,077
I'm sure he is.

122
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,248
But he is also a very
successful accountant.

123
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:30,135
Have a good day at work, honey.

124
00:08:52,729 --> 00:08:54,322
Come in.

125
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,839
Who's out there?

126
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,977
Hi, Mrs. Gurkel.
It's me, Steven.

127
00:09:20,276 --> 00:09:22,325
Yeah, whadda-you want?

128
00:09:22,555 --> 00:09:24,523
Fangora home?

129
00:09:24,849 --> 00:09:26,150
Who?

130
00:09:27,143 --> 00:09:28,445
Fanny.

131
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:33,732
<i>Where are you going?</i>

132
00:09:33,787 --> 00:09:36,247
<i>- I'm going out!
- You just went out!</i>

133
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,581
Mom, that's what people do.

134
00:09:37,606 --> 00:09:39,847
They come home, they go out.
It's crazy, I know.

135
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:42,685
You gotta come back and get
my prescription. - Yeah, yeah.

136
00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:45,966
- You gotta get my prescription!
- I'll get your prescription!

137
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:49,068
You are stupid!
You are so stupid!

138
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:52,347
Every time I leave the house!
This is bullshit!

139
00:09:52,381 --> 00:09:54,850
Now do you see why
I'm so fucked up?

140
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:56,468
I can see it, sure.

141
00:09:56,469 --> 00:09:58,854
OK, I got you something.

142
00:09:59,055 --> 00:10:01,389
Oh no. You shouldn't have.

143
00:10:01,474 --> 00:10:03,067
You can open it.

144
00:10:08,704 --> 00:10:10,997
- Open it!
- All right.

145
00:10:17,186 --> 00:10:18,795
- D'you like it?
- Oh!

146
00:10:19,006 --> 00:10:20,453
Yeah, I love it.

147
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,840
Great, I lifted it from Borders.

148
00:10:23,176 --> 00:10:24,793
You shouldn't have done that.

149
00:10:24,838 --> 00:10:26,738
Steven, you're worth it.

150
00:10:26,974 --> 00:10:28,934
OK, what are you doing on the 4th?

151
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,083
I dunno.

152
00:10:30,108 --> 00:10:32,442

You got balls, Steven.

155
00:10:35,918 --> 00:10:38,360
Most people stay in their
nowhere jobs till they die,

156
00:10:38,361 --> 00:10:41,349
but you; you fucking know what you
want and you're going after it.

157
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:43,316
That takes a big set
of iron balls.

158
00:10:43,397 --> 00:10:46,024
We're gonna kick ass,
man, I can feel it,

159
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:47,442
Y'know, both of us.

160
00:10:47,489 --> 00:10:49,223
You're gonna the
famous dummy guy

161
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,575
-I'm gonna kick ass with my band.
- Ventriloquist.

162
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:53,956
Dude, this is gonna be our year,
I can feel it.

163
00:10:53,961 --> 00:10:55,854
You can fuck me if I'm wrong.

164
00:10:55,911 --> 00:10:57,401
Well, that's OK.

165
00:10:59,457 --> 00:11:02,615
I'm glad things are going good
with the band, though. - Pfft!

166
00:11:02,711 --> 00:11:04,587
The band sucks, man.

167
00:11:04,736 --> 00:11:07,414
But we're gonna get a gig,
if I gotta kill someone.

168
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:08,925
I'm telling you, Steven,

169
00:11:08,926 --> 00:11:12,355
both of us are finally
gonna kick some Goddamn ass!

170

I gotta get a job,

They just call you dummy?

Heidi has been a little
depressed, lately.

940
00:53:27,266 --> 00:53:30,672
- I'm not depressed, I'm fine!
- Hey, c'mon, no yelling.
