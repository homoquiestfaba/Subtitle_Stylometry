1
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:43,709
Sorry.

2
00:02:49,649 --> 00:02:52,618
It's going to be okay.

3
00:02:52,652 --> 00:02:54,620
Just don't think
about it.

4
00:02:54,654 --> 00:02:57,054
Yeah.

5
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,058
I just hate hospitals.

6
00:02:59,092 --> 00:03:03,051
- Dang it.
- What?

7
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:05,394
I left my book
at the house.

8
00:03:05,432 --> 00:03:07,696
You know, in case
we have to wait.

9
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:10,168
Shoot! Um...

10
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:13,366
I'll look in my purse.

11
00:03:14,908 --> 00:03:16,808
You rock.

12
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:19,971
You left it
on the table.

13
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:23,507
Thank you.

14
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,518
Promise me you're not
gonna leave, all right?

15
00:03:25,552 --> 00:03:28,248
You're not gonna take off
when they put me under.

16
00:03:28,288 --> 00:03:30,188
I promise.

17
00:03:30,223 --> 00:03:33,056
I would never leave.

18
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:34,278
Woman: Isn't that always
the way it works?

19
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:35,845
Man: You'd think you see somebody
with a crutch, they're gonna help 'em out.

20
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:38,517
Right, naturally.
Don't even hold the door.

21
00:04:38,558 --> 00:04:42,119
All right, you stay there, please.
Give me one moment.

22
00:04:42,162 --> 00:04:44,153
I can at least
get out.

23
00:04:44,197 --> 00:04:46,324
Let me just
get the crutch.

24
00:04:46,366 --> 00:04:48,459
Wait, wait.

25
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:50,469
- I can just stand.
- Come on.

26
00:04:50,503 --> 00:04:53,370
The brace.

27
00:04:55,108 --> 00:04:57,076
You're awesome.

28
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,408
- I love you. Be careful.
- Love you. Thank you.

29
00:04:59,446 --> 00:05:01,209
- I'll be right up.
- All right.

30
00:05:15,295 --> 00:05:19,061
Woman #2: What's this I hear
about you taking the morning off?

31
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:21,932
Woman: Kevin has
orthopedic surgery today.

32
00:05:21,968 --> 00:05:24,402
Aww! You're such
a good girlfriend.

33
00:05:24,437 --> 00:05:27,167
I told you about it.
He's always there for me.

34
00:05:27,207 --> 00:05:29,198
He's amazing.

35
00:05:29,242 --> 00:05:32,177
I think the bank could
go one day without me.

36
00:05:32,212 --> 00:05:34,180
You don't mind
covering, right?

37
00:05:34,214 --> 00:05:35,681
Of course.
Of course.

38
00:05:35,715 --> 00:05:38,843
So when do I get
to meet him?

39
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:41,012
- I don't know.
- It's been fours months.

40
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:43,284
- I'm back. I wanna meet him.
- I know.

41
00:05:43,323 --> 00:05:47,157
I just have never been
in a relationship before

42
00:05:47,193 --> 00:05:50,060
where it's
actually going well.

43
00:06:05,512 --> 00:06:08,913
- How can I help you?
- Hi, where's outpatient surgery?

44
00:06:08,948 --> 00:06:11,382
- Squeezed you in under the wire, huh?
- What do you mean?

45
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:14,148
We're shutting down
for renovations on Saturday.

46
00:06:14,187 --> 00:06:16,781
Most of our patients have already
been moved to County West.

47
00:06:16,823 --> 00:06:18,791
- Oh.
- Go through those doors

48
00:06:18,825 --> 00:06:20,019
and take the elevator up.

49
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,120
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

50
00:06:39,145 --> 00:06:41,943
Tell him we'll give him
an extra basis point.

51
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:44,882
If he's worried
about the rates

52
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:46,476
and us not being
competitive,

53
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:49,613
tell him to just look
at our rates.

54
00:06:49,656 --> 00:06:51,647
Listen, Craig's
been on this case.

55
00:06:51,691 --> 00:06:54,023
Just have him deal
with it.

56
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,891
If you have any questions,
call Craig.

57
00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:57,760
Okay, bye.

58
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:04,261
Hi.

59
00:07:05,872 --> 00:07:08,136
Hey, baby.
Any trouble parking?

60
00:07:08,174 --> 00:07:12,133
No, but I did finally speak
with Christine,

61
00:07:12,178 --> 00:07:15,614
who wants us all

62
00:07:15,648 --> 00:07:17,741
to grab a pizza
this weekend.

63
00:07:17,784 --> 00:07:19,251
Her words.

64
00:07:19,285 --> 00:07:21,344
All of us.

65
00:07:21,387 --> 00:07:25,016
- The best friend that I never get to meet?
- Yes.

66
00:07:25,058 --> 00:07:26,923
That's a biggie.

67
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,396
"Heart disease?" No.
"Rheumatic fever?" No.

68
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,297
- "Snoring?"
- Sometimes.

69
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,791
- Really?
- Yeah.

70
00:07:36,836 --> 00:07:40,294
So you're sure you're okay
with this whole introduction thing

71
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,900
to your friends?
That's a big step.

72
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:45,001
No.

73
00:07:45,044 --> 00:07:48,207
Every time I introduce
her to anybody,

74
00:07:48,248 --> 00:07:50,876
it's sort of bad luck.

75
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:52,885
Well, don't you worry.

76
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:55,183
Because you are
not gonna lose me.

77
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:57,280
Ever.

78
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,950
"Social Security number"?

79
00:08:01,995 --> 00:08:04,395
I've been having the hardest time
writing on this.

80
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,864
Oh, here, lean on this.

81
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,993
Ahh. Thank you.

82
00:08:12,872 --> 00:08:15,864
So you must be
Kevin Peterson.

83
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:17,570
- I am.
- I'm Amanda.

84
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,271
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Mary.

85
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:21,143
Hi, nice to meet you.

86
00:08:21,181 --> 00:08:23,775
Dr. Harding will be in in a moment
so I just wanna check some things out.

87
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:25,478
Okay.

88
00:08:25,518 --> 00:08:28,612
- It's all done.
- Thank you.

89
00:08:30,824 --> 00:08:32,883
Does your wife
mind waiting outside?

90
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:36,123
Oh, well,
we're not married.

91
00:08:36,162 --> 00:08:37,993
I don't mind.

92
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:41,899
Do you have a place
I could grab a coffee?

93
00:08:41,935 --> 00:08:44,403
We have a cafeteria attached
to the lobby downstairs.

94
00:08:44,437 --> 00:08:47,304
Perfect. Thank you.
You gonna be okay?

95
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,207
Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.
Don't leave me though, right?

96
00:08:50,243 --> 00:08:52,211
- Promise?
- I promise.

97
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:54,406
Cross my heart, promise.

98
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:56,438
Okay.

99
00:08:57,617 --> 00:09:00,586
You take care of him.

100
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:05,090
Oh, how long
will it be?

101
00:09:05,124 --> 00:09:07,149
- About an hour.
- An hour? Really?

102
00:09:07,193 --> 00:09:09,354
- Yep.
- Well, good luck.

103
00:09:09,395 --> 00:09:11,522
Thank you.

104
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:16,797
See you in an hour.

105
00:09:18,738 --> 00:09:22,697
Just tell him that he has to sign
the request form in person.

106
00:09:22,742 --> 00:09:25,074
Yeah, he has to come in.

107
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:27,602
He already knows that.
Just do it.

108
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:29,342
I'll tell him
if I have to.

109
00:09:29,382 --> 00:09:31,407
Oh, I'm so sorry.

110
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:33,112
Let him know I'll call
him back this afternoon.

111
00:09:33,152 --> 00:09:35,245
I'll call you back,
bye.

112
00:09:35,288 --> 00:09:38,416
- Let me please.
- Thank you.

113
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,653
Sorry.
There's a garbage...

114
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:43,856
- Yeah.
- Right there and another one.

115
00:09:43,897 --> 00:09:46,229
Oh, thanks a lot.

116
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:48,734
- I'm Cooper, by the way.
- Cooper, I'm Mary.

117
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:52,568
- Mary.
- Pleasure to meet you.

118
00:09:52,605 --> 00:09:55,870
- You want some company?
- Sure.

119
00:09:55,909 --> 00:09:58,241
Well, okay.

120
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,077
So what are you-

121
00:10:04,117 --> 00:10:07,518
- What am I in for?
- I wasn't going to say it quite like that,

122
00:10:07,553 --> 00:10:08,986
but yes.

123
00:10:09,022 --> 00:10:12,048
My wife,
she has breast cancer,

124
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:15,891
and well,
she's up in chemo.

125
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:18,124
How's it going?
I'm sorry.

126
00:10:18,164 --> 00:10:21,930
Small improvement.
We're keeping our fingers crossed.

127
00:10:21,968 --> 00:10:25,096
- So we'll see what happens.
- I'm sorry.

128
00:10:25,138 --> 00:10:27,106
What about you? You're not here
for the coffee, right?

129
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,940
I'm just here
for the day.

130
00:10:30,977 --> 00:10:34,310
My boyfriend's having
orthopedic surgery.

131
00:10:34,347 --> 00:10:37,783
He tore his A.C.L.

132
00:10:37,817 --> 00:10:40,718
hiking and flared up
an old football injury.

133
00:10:40,753 --> 00:10:42,277
He hurt himself, huh?

134
00:10:42,322 --> 00:10:45,655
Yep. Keep telling him
to take it easy.

135
00:10:45,692 --> 00:10:47,250
You don't like
hospitals, do you?

136
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:49,488
Does anybody like hospitals?

137
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:51,326
Except for the doctors
and nurses?

138
00:10:51,364 --> 00:10:54,231
I've been doing this
every week for six months.

139
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:56,326
And I can't wait till
they shut this place down.

140
00:10:56,369 --> 00:10:58,894
- Believe you me.
- Sorry.

141
00:11:03,343 --> 00:11:06,107
Wow, look at you go.

142
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:07,703
It's my job.

143
00:11:07,747 --> 00:11:10,944
MIT said that 90% of people
who use smartphones

144
00:11:10,984 --> 00:11:12,815
feel more stress.

145
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:16,447
Only 90%?

146
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:19,390
I mean, look at you. You're sitting
in a hospital waiting for your boyfriend,

147
00:11:19,425 --> 00:11:21,518
and you're working.

148
00:11:21,561 --> 00:11:23,188
What happened to the days
where you could say,

149
00:11:23,229 --> 00:11:24,787
"I'm out of the office,"
you know?

150
00:11:28,101 --> 00:11:32,060
Well, sir,
to the good old days.

151
00:11:32,105 --> 00:11:36,007
- Cheers, Mary.
- Cheers.

152
00:11:47,587 --> 00:11:50,351
Kevin.

153
00:12:41,274 --> 00:12:44,710
Man over P.A.: Monica Hernandez,
your party is ready in post-op.

154
00:12:50,883 --> 00:12:52,817
Jeanette Stevens,
Mary Turner,

155
00:12:52,852 --> 00:12:55,548
your parties are ready.

156
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,178
- May I help you?
- Yes, please.

157
00:13:53,212 --> 00:13:55,772
Hi. My boyfriend
was having surgery,

158
00:13:55,815 --> 00:13:58,306
and I just want to see
how much longer it's going to be.

159
00:13:58,351 --> 00:14:00,114
Certainly.
What was his name?

160
00:14:00,153 --> 00:14:03,088
Peterson- Kevin Peterson.

161
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:06,285
You're sure?
How are you spelling it?

162
00:14:06,325 --> 00:14:08,452
P-e-t-e-r...

163
00:14:08,494 --> 00:14:12,225
- s-o-n. Peterson.
- Peterson with an "O."

164
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:15,860
I'm not showing anyone
in our system with that name.

165
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:19,394
Okay, well, he's definitely
having surgery.

166
00:14:19,438 --> 00:14:21,497
- Do you happen to-
- Orthopedics.

167
00:14:25,111 --> 00:14:27,079
Do you happen
to remember the room number?

168
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:29,638
Yeah, it was right down the hall,
actually. This floor.

169
00:14:29,682 --> 00:14:32,150
- What about the doctor's name?
- Room 714.

170
00:14:32,185 --> 00:14:34,346
Harding.
Dr. Harding.

171
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:35,979
Dr. Harding's off today.

172
00:14:36,022 --> 00:14:38,923
I'm sorry.

173
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,552
There's no one
in our system

174
00:14:41,594 --> 00:14:43,425
with the name
Kevin Peterson.

175
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:45,896
Well...

176
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:47,900
Are you sure it could have
been in this hospital?

177
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:49,629
Perhaps it was
in another hospital.

178
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:51,637
We've stopped doing
outpatient procedures at this time.

179
00:14:51,671 --> 00:14:54,071
Okay, I was here.

180
00:14:54,106 --> 00:14:56,666
We drove together.

181
00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:00,270
During pre-op,
I was in the room with him.

182
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:03,510
- Lovely nurse came in to prep him.
- What was the nurse's name?

183
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:06,177
No, what was her name?
Amanda.

184
00:15:06,219 --> 00:15:08,414
Amanda.

185
00:15:08,454 --> 00:15:10,684
- Do you know her?
- Doesn't ring a bell.

186
00:15:10,723 --> 00:15:14,022
Okay. Maybe orthopedics
she's in.

187
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,857
Are you sure that he just
didn't leave without you?

188
00:15:15,895 --> 00:15:19,126
I have the keys.
I have the keys to the car.

189
00:15:19,165 --> 00:15:22,601
Okay? I just wanna know
where my boyfriend is.

190
00:15:22,635 --> 00:15:25,604
Can you please help
me find him? Thanks.

191
00:15:25,638 --> 00:15:27,629
I'm sorry.
He's not in our systems.

192
00:15:27,673 --> 00:15:29,698
This is ridiculous.

193
00:15:31,177 --> 00:15:33,771
Would you like me
to page him for you?

194
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:35,644
Thank you.
That would be great.

195
00:15:35,681 --> 00:15:38,081
Kevin Peterson,
can you please dial 9

196
00:15:38,117 --> 00:15:40,608
and come
to the courtesy phone?

197
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:43,451
Kevin Peterson,
please dial 9.

198
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:45,889
Kevin Peterson, please dial 9
at the courtesy phone.

199
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:48,291
Hey, this is Kevin.
Do your business after the beep.

200
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:50,090
Sweetheart.

201
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:52,290
Ma'am, you cannot use
your cell phone.

202
00:15:52,331 --> 00:15:55,323
- I'll be two seconds.
- You cannot use your cell phone.

203
00:15:55,368 --> 00:15:59,202
I have this nurse that's driving me
absolutely crazy.

204
00:15:59,238 --> 00:16:02,435
I'm at the nurses' station
on the floor that had a room-

205
00:16:02,475 --> 00:16:06,434
714 was on the last
place I saw you.

206
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:10,313
Right now it is-
it's definitely been over an hour.

207
00:16:10,349 --> 00:16:12,579
I can tell you that much.
It's been hours,

208
00:16:12,618 --> 00:16:14,916
and I've looked everywhere.
I can't find you.

209
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:17,445
The second you get this message,
okay, you call me.

210
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,789
Okay, baby.

211
00:16:20,826 --> 00:16:24,660
You call me, okay?
Love you. I love you.

212
00:16:35,641 --> 00:16:39,236
Hi, we met this morning.

213
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:41,610
You told me where

214
00:16:41,647 --> 00:16:44,514
to check in
for outpatient surgery.

215
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,576
Kevin Peterson is
a patient here.

216
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,453
- His doctor is Dr. Harding.
- Okay.

217
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:54,220
He is my boyfriend.
I can't find him anywhere.

218
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,854
- Do you remember me from earlier?
- I remember you.

219
00:16:56,896 --> 00:16:59,729
- You were by yourself.
- I was.

220
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:02,029
I dropped him off
in the parking structure, okay.

221
00:17:02,068 --> 00:17:04,036
I don't make mix-ups,

222
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,868
and my computer is giving me
the correct information.

223
00:17:06,906 --> 00:17:08,874
And there is no
Kevin Peterson.

224
00:17:08,908 --> 00:17:11,206
Perhaps it's new information,
or something's changed.

225
00:17:11,243 --> 00:17:13,939
I'm looking at my computer printout
and I don't see a Kevin Peterson.

226
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:16,447
I heard you. Okay.
Thank you.

227
00:17:18,017 --> 00:17:20,542
- Excuse me.
- Yes, can I help you?

228
00:17:20,586 --> 00:17:22,554
Yes, please. I'm looking
for someone who's missing.

229
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:24,317
- Missing
- He's 35,

230
00:17:24,357 --> 00:17:26,825
6'1", dark hair,
dark eyes.

231
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:29,327
I haven't seen anybody
by that description. I'm sorry.

232
00:17:29,362 --> 00:17:31,990
He's wearing a brace
on his left leg.

233
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:33,464
Are you okay?

234
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:37,998
Ma'am, are you okay?

235
00:17:38,037 --> 00:17:40,665
Excuse me.

236
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:42,765
Yeah, this is Holloway
in the lobby.

237
00:17:42,808 --> 00:17:44,799
Yeah, I've got a young woman
who's looking

238
00:17:44,844 --> 00:17:46,869
for an unidentified male.

239
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:03,762
Hi, I'm looking
for a patient

240
00:18:03,796 --> 00:18:05,127
that's in recovery
named Kevin Peterson.

241
00:18:05,164 --> 00:18:06,597
Never heard of him.

242
00:18:06,632 --> 00:18:09,567
Thank you.

243
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:12,435
- Hi.
- Hi, excuse me. Can I help you?

244
00:18:12,471 --> 00:18:15,065
Hi, yes, I am looking
for Kevin Peterson,

245
00:18:15,107 --> 00:18:16,734
Dr. Harding's patient.

246
00:18:16,776 --> 00:18:19,404
Great, I understand.
This is a restricted area.

247
00:18:19,445 --> 00:18:21,743
- I think he's just back there.
- I understand, ma'am,

248
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:23,271
but I need you to leave
the restricted area.

249
00:18:23,315 --> 00:18:26,580
He is an outpatient.
He's recovering.

250
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:29,087
This is recovery.

251
00:18:29,121 --> 00:18:31,817
Excuse me,
excuse me. Hi.

252
00:18:31,857 --> 00:18:34,792
I'm sorry.
I'm very busy right now. I'm very sorry.

253
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:36,954
Okay.

254
00:18:36,996 --> 00:18:40,124
- Hi.
- I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm with a patient.

255
00:18:42,635 --> 00:18:45,832
Look, ma'am, I really need you
to get out of this area.

256
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:48,669
Security, can you
take her away, please?

257
00:18:48,707 --> 00:18:50,675
Ma'am, this is
a restricted area.

258
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:54,406
Ma'am, I'm sorry. This is a restricted area.
You have to leave.

259
00:18:54,447 --> 00:18:56,608
Can you please escort me
to Dr. Harding instead?

260
00:18:56,649 --> 00:18:58,913
Yes. You have to
get out of here.

261
00:18:58,951 --> 00:19:02,785
It's a restricted area.

262
00:19:05,024 --> 00:19:07,788
This is her.

263
00:19:07,827 --> 00:19:09,795
And this is Miss Markham,
our hospital administrator.

264
00:19:09,829 --> 00:19:12,093
- Thank you. Hi, thank God.
- How can I help you?

265
00:19:12,131 --> 00:19:16,033
I'm Mary Walsh. My boyfriend
had surgery here this morning.

266
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:17,797
- He's missing.
- Missing?

267
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:20,271
- Yes.
- I told her there was no one

268
00:19:20,306 --> 00:19:22,774
who's checked into this hospital
by the name of Kevin Peterson.

269
00:19:22,808 --> 00:19:25,641
Okay, well, he had
orthopedic surgery-

270
00:19:25,678 --> 00:19:28,238
A.C.L.- this morning.

271
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,770
His doctor
is Dr. Harding.

272
00:19:29,815 --> 00:19:32,784
Evidently, neither one
of them are in your system.

273
00:19:32,818 --> 00:19:36,185
And no one's in his room.

274
00:19:36,222 --> 00:19:38,315
Okay, well, obviously there's been
some kind of mistake.

275
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:40,325
That's what I've been trying
to explain to you.

276
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:43,157
Come with me, please.
Let me see what we can do.

277
00:19:43,195 --> 00:19:46,164
What time this morning was it that you
and your boyfriend arrived?

278
00:19:46,198 --> 00:19:49,031
About 7:15.
Surgery started at 8:00.

279
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:51,229
Okay, and you're the one

280
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,898
- who arrived here with him.
- Correct.

281
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,973
Okay.

282
00:19:59,011 --> 00:20:01,912
Oh...
Rewind that a hair.

283
00:20:05,918 --> 00:20:08,386
Wait, stop.

284
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,650
All right,
these numbers don't-

285
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:12,714
These times don't coincide.

286
00:20:12,758 --> 00:20:14,589
Keep fast-forwarding,
please.

287
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:18,393
We weren't even out
of bed yet.

288
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:21,263
Okay, keep going.

289
00:20:28,207 --> 00:20:30,835
Okay, right here.

290
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:33,037
We were already here.

291
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:35,706
Back it up, please.

292
00:20:35,748 --> 00:20:38,239
Okay, now...

293
00:20:38,284 --> 00:20:40,946
rewind it just a hair.

294
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:44,922
Wait, wait.

295
00:20:44,957 --> 00:20:46,925
Wait, did you see that?

296
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:49,120
Turn it back.

297
00:20:49,161 --> 00:20:52,130
Go back a bit.
Play it from this point.

298
00:20:52,164 --> 00:20:53,290
Good.

299
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:05,601
Keep playing, please.

300
00:21:09,915 --> 00:21:12,713
Pause! That's him.

301
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:14,218
Right there.

302
00:21:14,253 --> 00:21:16,380
That's him.

303
00:21:16,422 --> 00:21:18,447
He's wearing the green
and gray striped shirt.

304
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:21,926
Color accuracy is difficult to determine
on closed-circuit cameras.

305
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:24,794
You've gotta be kidding me.
That's him. He's right there.

306
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,856
Markham: Miss Walsh.

307
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,664
Mary:
I'm looking at him, you know?

308
00:21:32,805 --> 00:21:36,468
He may not be in your computer,
but he's right on your security camera.

309
00:21:36,508 --> 00:21:39,500
Do you have a copy of his hospital
appointment record?

310
00:21:39,545 --> 00:21:42,343
No, it was on him.

311
00:21:45,851 --> 00:21:48,786
Oh God.

312
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:52,086
It might be in his
computer bag in the car.

313
00:21:52,124 --> 00:21:54,319
I will have my team
look for him,

314
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,319
- but you know I'm understaffed.
- Yeah.

315
00:21:58,364 --> 00:21:59,854
Where do you think
you're going?

316
00:21:59,898 --> 00:22:03,561
I'm gonna go call somebody who
can actually help me out here.

317
00:22:11,443 --> 00:22:13,411
I just didn't think there was
anything conclusive on that.

318
00:22:13,445 --> 00:22:16,141
Do what you can,
but...

319
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:17,978
- You got it, Miss Markham.
- Thank you.

320
00:22:18,017 --> 00:22:21,145
Yeah, come in.

321
00:22:22,621 --> 00:22:24,452
Man: Breathe in...

322
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:27,323
...out, in...

323
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,224
out.

324
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:35,826
- How is it, Doc?
- It's 160 over 100.

325
00:22:35,868 --> 00:22:37,836
You still taking
the medication?

326
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,703
Every day.

327
00:22:40,739 --> 00:22:43,230
- What about work?
- What about it?

328
00:22:43,275 --> 00:22:45,243
I don't know, Rich.

329
00:22:45,277 --> 00:22:47,245
Something like this
takes time.

330
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:49,008
You don't wanna rush it.

331
00:22:49,048 --> 00:22:51,141
Heaven forbid.

332
00:22:51,183 --> 00:22:53,549
- I'm gonna increase the dosage though.
- Okay, thanks.

333
00:22:53,585 --> 00:22:56,748
But I really need you
to take it easy, man.

334
00:22:56,789 --> 00:22:59,257
Whatever you say, Doc.

335
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,759
All right.
See you on Thursday?

336
00:23:01,794 --> 00:23:03,955
- Wouldn't miss it.
- All right, take care.

337
00:23:13,072 --> 00:23:15,040
- Franklin here.
- Woman: This is dispatch.

338
00:23:15,074 --> 00:23:18,271
We've got reports of a missing person
at County Memorial.

339
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:21,040
- Are you still there?
- Yeah, I'm still here.

340
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,071
What floor?

341
00:23:28,153 --> 00:23:30,621
Mary: When I arrived,
he wasn't in his room.

342
00:23:30,656 --> 00:23:34,615
So I went down
to the waiting room

343
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,460
and waited there
for a good couple of hours.

344
00:23:38,497 --> 00:23:41,022
Started getting
increasingly concerned

345
00:23:41,066 --> 00:23:44,866
and went back to his floor
and spoke with the head nurse

346
00:23:44,903 --> 00:23:48,134
and learned for the first time
that he was not in the computer system.

347
00:23:48,173 --> 00:23:51,165
We have looked. No one by the name
of Kevin Peterson was scheduled

348
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,508
for anything today,
not even a check-up.

349
00:23:53,545 --> 00:23:56,537
What about the nurse,
this Amanda?

350
00:23:56,582 --> 00:23:58,447
We don't have anyone
on staff by that name,

351
00:23:58,484 --> 00:24:01,112
- and the doctor that he was supposedly-
- Dr. Harding.

352
00:24:01,153 --> 00:24:03,553
scheduled with
is on vacation.

353
00:24:03,589 --> 00:24:06,422
Look, if you could just access Kevin's
insurance records.

354
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,449
I'm sorry.
I can't do that.

355
00:24:08,494 --> 00:24:10,257
Why?

356
00:24:10,295 --> 00:24:12,490
The insurance company will
only release information

357
00:24:12,531 --> 00:24:14,499
to the policyholder's
spouse.

358
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:18,333
Okay, but this is an emergency situation.
He's missing.

359
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:21,498
I'm sorry. The hospital
can't release any information

360
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,804
to a non-family member
without a court order.

361
00:24:23,842 --> 00:24:26,310
Detective...

362
00:24:26,345 --> 00:24:28,836
I'm getting
really really worried

363
00:24:28,881 --> 00:24:31,179
that something bad's
happened to him.

364
00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:35,810
Can you please help me?

365
00:24:35,854 --> 00:24:37,947
Okay, first of all,

366
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,254
I can't file a report
for 24 hours.

367
00:24:40,292 --> 00:24:42,351
24 hours?

368
00:24:42,394 --> 00:24:44,157
I'll be honest with you,
Miss Walsh,

369
00:24:44,196 --> 00:24:47,097
most of the time we get
a call saying a spouse

370
00:24:47,132 --> 00:24:51,034
or boyfriend or whatever
is missing,

371
00:24:51,069 --> 00:24:52,798
usually they just up
and left.

372
00:24:52,838 --> 00:24:55,466
Have you considered
the possibility

373
00:24:55,507 --> 00:24:58,533
that your boyfriend
might have walked out on you?

374
00:24:58,577 --> 00:25:00,943
I could see how you two
would think that,

375
00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:04,176
but that's just
not him, no.

376
00:25:04,216 --> 00:25:06,810
- How long have you been together?
- Four months.

377
00:25:06,852 --> 00:25:09,047
Markham: That's not a lot of time
to get to know someone.

378
00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:13,685
Maybe your relationship
isn't what you thought it was.

379
00:25:13,725 --> 00:25:16,694
No, I trust him.

380
00:25:16,728 --> 00:25:18,855
Detective Franklin:
Do you have a picture?

381
00:25:20,332 --> 00:25:21,822
Maybe, wait.

382
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:27,400
I think.
Hold on, I think I do.

383
00:25:27,439 --> 00:25:30,670
Yeah, right here.

384
00:25:33,912 --> 00:25:35,436
Can you make
anything out?

385
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,641
Markham:
No.

386
00:25:37,683 --> 00:25:39,514
Well, it's not
the best picture.

387
00:25:39,551 --> 00:25:42,315
It's something.

388
00:25:42,354 --> 00:25:44,117
How about a description?

389
00:25:44,156 --> 00:25:48,115
He's 6'0",
maybe 6'1".

390
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,890
Around 190.

391
00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:53,261
Brown hair.

392
00:25:53,298 --> 00:25:55,323
Brown eyes.

393
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:57,961
He was wearing
a green

394
00:25:58,003 --> 00:26:01,404
and gray shirt today
and shorts

395
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,931
because he has
on a huge leg brace.

396
00:26:03,976 --> 00:26:05,568
And he was using a crutch.

397
00:26:05,611 --> 00:26:08,409
Shirt was
long-sleeved.

398
00:26:10,482 --> 00:26:12,450
Security has their people
searching the entire hospital

399
00:26:12,484 --> 00:26:16,443
and no one has seen anyone
matching that description.

400
00:26:16,488 --> 00:26:18,956
I'll see
what I can find.

401
00:26:18,991 --> 00:26:20,959
In the meantime,
I need you to sit right here.

402
00:26:20,993 --> 00:26:22,688
I feel very awkward

403
00:26:22,728 --> 00:26:24,696
just not doing anything
and staying here.

404
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,028
Miss Walsh, the more cooperation
I can get from you,

405
00:26:27,065 --> 00:26:28,896
the faster this can go
for everyone.

406
00:26:28,934 --> 00:26:30,561
All right? Okay?

407
00:26:30,602 --> 00:26:32,866
- Okay.
- Thank you.

408
00:26:32,905 --> 00:26:34,031
Thank you.

409
00:26:34,072 --> 00:26:36,040
If you hear anything,
give me a call.

410
00:26:36,074 --> 00:26:39,009
- Anything I can do to help.
- Thank you.

411
00:26:39,044 --> 00:26:40,534
Thank you.

412
00:26:40,579 --> 00:26:43,912
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

413
00:26:43,949 --> 00:26:45,541
Will you excuse me
for a minute?

414
00:26:45,584 --> 00:26:47,142
Yes, of course.

415
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:14,501
Have you seen a male Caucasian,
mid 30s, dark hair,

416
00:27:14,546 --> 00:27:17,481
wearing dark shorts,
green sweatshirt?

417
00:27:17,516 --> 00:27:21,384
Excuse me, you wouldn't happen
to recall seeing a male Caucasian mid 30s,

418
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,980
wearing a gray-striped
hoodie with shorts?

419
00:27:24,022 --> 00:27:27,150
- No.
- Okay, thank you.

420
00:27:33,632 --> 00:27:36,032
Could you tell me where
the outpatient surgery is?

421
00:27:36,068 --> 00:27:38,036
Yeah, if you just keep going
straight down the hall

422
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,470
you'll run right into it.

423
00:28:05,263 --> 00:28:07,595
Woman:
Can I help you, sir?

424
00:28:07,632 --> 00:28:10,931
Yeah, I couldn't help
but notice

425
00:28:10,969 --> 00:28:13,199
there are no patients
on this level.

426
00:28:13,238 --> 00:28:15,502
Yeah, everyone's been moved
to another facility.

427
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,668
They are shutting this entire hospital down
Saturday for renovation.

428
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:22,009
You mean no one has been
in any of these rooms today?

429
00:28:22,047 --> 00:28:24,914
No. Are you looking
for someone?

430
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:28,818
I'm fine, thanks.

431
00:28:28,854 --> 00:28:31,982
You wouldn't happen
to know

432
00:28:32,024 --> 00:28:34,049
of a nurse named Amanda,
would you?

433
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:36,356
Amanda? No.

434
00:28:36,395 --> 00:28:38,386
- No, no one.
- Are you sure?

435
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,728
I'm the head nurse.
I would know.

436
00:28:40,766 --> 00:28:43,394
- Thanks.
- Have a good day.

437
00:28:43,435 --> 00:28:45,596
Franklin: Excuse me, I'm looking
for a patient by the name

438
00:28:45,637 --> 00:28:48,003
of Kevin Peterson...

439
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,200
Excuse me,
I'm looking for a guy,

440
00:28:49,241 --> 00:28:52,233
mid 30s, 6' tall-
Kevin Peterson.

441
00:28:52,277 --> 00:28:54,245
He's wearing
a striped hoodie.

442
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:55,940
You wouldn't happen to recall
seeing a male Caucasian, mid 30s,

443
00:28:55,981 --> 00:28:58,541
wearing a gray-striped
hoodie with shorts?

444
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:01,450
- Woman: No.
- Kevin Peterson checked in, mid 30s.

445
00:29:01,486 --> 00:29:03,454
I'm looking for a patient
by the name of Kevin Peterson...

446
00:29:03,488 --> 00:29:06,753
By the name of Kevin Peterson...
Kevin Peterson, checked in today.

447
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:10,125
- Gray-striped hoodie with shorts...
- Woman: No.

448
00:29:10,162 --> 00:29:12,323
Woman: Look, I just clock in
and I clock out.

449
00:29:12,364 --> 00:29:15,925
You do not recall hearing the name
Kevin Peterson today? Is that right?

450
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:18,060
Woman: No.

451
00:29:46,698 --> 00:29:49,428
Mary: Chris, I'm in the security room
at the hospital.

452
00:29:49,468 --> 00:29:50,901
I took Kevin in
and he's missing.

453
00:29:50,936 --> 00:29:53,530
Look, slow down, okay?
You're scaring me.

454
00:29:53,572 --> 00:29:56,268
What's going on?
Nobody just disappears.

455
00:29:56,308 --> 00:29:58,242
No, he is missing.

456
00:29:58,276 --> 00:30:01,268
I haven't seen him since the surgery.
I feel like I'm going crazy.

457
00:30:01,313 --> 00:30:03,042
What are you
talking about?

458
00:30:03,081 --> 00:30:06,414
Saw him in pre-op. Boom,
went back to the room, gone.

459
00:30:06,451 --> 00:30:09,079
He's not even in the computer system.
He's missing.

460
00:30:09,121 --> 00:30:12,318
Okay, sweetie, you know,
you just met Kevin.

461
00:30:12,357 --> 00:30:14,518
Maybe...

462
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,925
He didn't leave me,
honey.

463
00:30:16,962 --> 00:30:19,192
Oh my God, sweetheart.
I'm not saying that he left you.

464
00:30:19,231 --> 00:30:22,257
I know we've only been
together for four months,

465
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,700
but I have been waiting for him
my whole entire life.

466
00:30:24,736 --> 00:30:28,365
And I'm not gonna let someone
take him away from me.

467
00:30:28,406 --> 00:30:31,136
Okay, do you want me to come there?
What do you want me to do?

468
00:30:31,176 --> 00:30:33,474
Do you want me to call the police?
You're scaring me.

469
00:30:33,512 --> 00:30:36,811
No, I already called the police.
That's why the detective's here.

470
00:30:36,848 --> 00:30:38,645
I think I hear
somebody coming.

471
00:30:38,683 --> 00:30:40,651
Everybody's acting really strange.

472
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:42,778
There's something
real off here.

473
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:46,655
I think they're all crazy.
Or I'm the crazy one.

474
00:30:46,691 --> 00:30:49,626
So please, please,
just keep checking in.

475
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:52,129
If I don't answer,
come find me, okay?

476
00:31:08,213 --> 00:31:11,478
I'm having the hardest time
writing on this.

477
00:31:11,516 --> 00:31:13,211
Oh, here, lean on this.

478
00:31:13,251 --> 00:31:15,412
Ahh. Thank you.

479
00:31:32,204 --> 00:31:34,672
- So what's going on?
- What's going on? Well, Miss Walsh,

480
00:31:34,739 --> 00:31:38,004
Detective Franklin is out
looking for your boyfriend.

481
00:31:38,043 --> 00:31:40,443
It's been over an hour.

482
00:31:40,478 --> 00:31:42,673
It's a big hospital.

483
00:31:42,714 --> 00:31:45,342
You know, I think
I'm gonna look myself.

484
00:31:45,383 --> 00:31:47,351
Listen, I can't
have you doing that.

485
00:31:47,385 --> 00:31:49,444
I can't have you walking around
the hallway scaring other patients.

486
00:31:49,487 --> 00:31:52,183
Do you understand?

487
00:31:52,224 --> 00:31:54,784
- Hi.
- I've been to all seven floors

488
00:31:54,826 --> 00:31:57,124
and not a single person
has seen him.

489
00:31:57,162 --> 00:31:59,824
Okay, um...

490
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,295
Then please,
I have to file a report.

491
00:32:05,337 --> 00:32:08,568
I told you he needs to be
missing for 24 hours.

492
00:32:08,607 --> 00:32:12,441
24 hours is too long.
Anything can happen in 24 hours.

493
00:32:12,477 --> 00:32:14,707
Please, file a report.

494
00:32:14,746 --> 00:32:17,214
What does Kevin do
for a living?

495
00:32:17,249 --> 00:32:20,650
He's in insurance.

496
00:32:20,685 --> 00:32:23,051
Well, at least
he's covered.

497
00:32:23,088 --> 00:32:26,114
Have you ever been to his office?
Meet any of his colleagues?

498
00:32:26,157 --> 00:32:29,149
No, he's freelance.
He works from the house.

499
00:32:29,194 --> 00:32:33,130
But I did,
while you were gone,

500
00:32:33,164 --> 00:32:35,860
jot this down for you.

501
00:32:39,738 --> 00:32:41,569
Wait, you just happened
to remember it?

502
00:32:41,606 --> 00:32:45,303
I'd appreciate it
if you ran it.

503
00:32:45,343 --> 00:32:48,141
I'll see
what I can do.

504
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:51,910
In the meantime, is there anybody
else I could talk to?

505
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:54,714
Anybody who knew
he'd be here today?

506
00:32:54,753 --> 00:32:57,745
- What about family?
- Ooh! His mother.

507
00:32:57,789 --> 00:33:00,485
She lives in Florida,

508
00:33:00,525 --> 00:33:03,858
but he was gonna put her number
into my phone in case of an emergency.

509
00:33:03,895 --> 00:33:07,194
I just totally forgot.

510
00:33:07,232 --> 00:33:09,132
Thank you.

511
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:12,034
Okay.

512
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:15,062
Wait.

513
00:33:17,108 --> 00:33:20,703
The number you have reached
is not in service at this time.

514
00:33:20,745 --> 00:33:22,610
- There is no new number.
- No luck.

515
00:33:22,647 --> 00:33:26,083
He must have input
a wrong digit.

516
00:33:26,117 --> 00:33:28,642
He's always been bad
electronically.

517
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:35,890
Shoot!

518
00:33:35,927 --> 00:33:39,454
You need proof.
You need some sort of evidence

519
00:33:39,497 --> 00:33:42,796
that this is real,
that he actually exists,

520
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:44,529
don't you?

521
00:33:47,706 --> 00:33:50,732
- Antidepressants.
- I, uh-

522
00:33:50,775 --> 00:33:53,505
I have a prescription
for that, so...

523
00:33:53,545 --> 00:33:56,275
Holloway: That kind of
says it all, doesn't it?

524
00:33:56,314 --> 00:33:58,407
Please hand that to me.

525
00:34:00,085 --> 00:34:02,883
I'll be right back,
Mr. Holloway.

526
00:34:02,921 --> 00:34:05,048
Where are you going?

527
00:34:06,991 --> 00:34:09,824
May I have
my medication back, please?

528
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:19,360
Detective Franklin,

529
00:34:19,404 --> 00:34:21,736
we have people here
she can talk to.

530
00:34:21,773 --> 00:34:24,367
I'm sure Miss Markham
could arrange something.

531
00:34:26,311 --> 00:34:29,075
All right, I'll run
the Social. I'll be back.

532
00:34:29,114 --> 00:34:32,641
You got it.

533
00:34:46,564 --> 00:34:48,623
Come on.

534
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:22,460
- Wait wait.
- Just stay out of the way.

535
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,401
Come on.
Your brace.

536
00:35:25,437 --> 00:35:27,405
Do you want your bag?

537
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:29,430
No, just leave it
in the back. That's fine.

538
00:35:47,892 --> 00:35:49,883
Thank God.

539
00:36:00,472 --> 00:36:02,463
Where is it?

540
00:36:05,243 --> 00:36:07,939
Okay, wanna come
upstairs now?

541
00:36:07,979 --> 00:36:09,970
Shoot!

542
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:16,643
Holloway:
It's not under the seat.

543
00:36:16,688 --> 00:36:18,417
Shoot!

544
00:36:19,757 --> 00:36:22,021
Wanna come upstairs now?

545
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,790
- It's not here.
- What's not here?

546
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:27,229
His bag. It has
his computer in it,

547
00:36:27,265 --> 00:36:30,666
all of his information-
everything.

548
00:36:30,702 --> 00:36:32,932
Somebody had to have
gotten into the car.

549
00:36:32,971 --> 00:36:35,201
What makes you think that?

550
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,970
Because the bag was here
this morning. Now it's not.

551
00:36:38,009 --> 00:36:41,206
- It was right there.
- Miss Walsh, we need to speak with you.

552
00:36:41,246 --> 00:36:42,838
Now.

553
00:36:42,881 --> 00:36:45,042
I have the only set of keys.

554
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:47,551
Now.

555
00:36:56,127 --> 00:36:58,994
We're in the middle
of a huge transition.

556
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,794
I've got patients to move,
equipment to transport.

557
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:04,301
Every minute that I
or my security team

558
00:37:04,335 --> 00:37:07,270
spends chasing phantoms
on surveillance cameras

559
00:37:07,305 --> 00:37:10,206
or finding you trespassing
in a restricted area is one less minute

560
00:37:10,241 --> 00:37:12,209
we're able to do our jobs.

561
00:37:12,243 --> 00:37:15,110
Every minute you don't spending
looking for Kevin is a minute wasted.

562
00:37:15,146 --> 00:37:18,206
Mary, I checked seven
floors of this building.

563
00:37:18,249 --> 00:37:20,513
I checked with every
nurse's station.

564
00:37:20,552 --> 00:37:23,521
I checked the emergency room.
I checked the intensive care ward.

565
00:37:23,555 --> 00:37:25,614
What about the wing
that's being renovated?

566
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:27,522
Franklin: Yes.

567
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:29,959
- And?
- And no one

568
00:37:29,994 --> 00:37:31,791
reported seeing
your boyfriend.

569
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:34,730
No one can even confirm that
he was in this hospital.

570
00:37:34,766 --> 00:37:36,961
Just what do you suppose
happened to him?

571
00:37:37,001 --> 00:37:39,196
- I don't know.
- Holloway: Look, there are 23 exits

572
00:37:39,237 --> 00:37:42,673
in this facility.
Six are manned by my men.

573
00:37:42,707 --> 00:37:45,608
Eight are alarmed and the rest are
carefully monitored by cameras.

574
00:37:45,643 --> 00:37:47,873
If anyone left this building

575
00:37:47,912 --> 00:37:49,743
under any manner
of duress

576
00:37:49,781 --> 00:37:51,510
we would know about it.

577
00:37:51,549 --> 00:37:54,211
Well, obviously, you're not
looking hard enough.

578
00:37:56,955 --> 00:38:00,413
- Detective...
- Detective Franklin.

579
00:38:01,759 --> 00:38:04,751
- Detective, who is it?
- Really?

580
00:38:04,796 --> 00:38:08,425
Okay, thank you.

581
00:38:08,466 --> 00:38:10,058
What did they say?

582
00:38:10,101 --> 00:38:13,229
We ran the Social Security number
you gave me.

583
00:38:13,271 --> 00:38:16,138
Good, okay,
what's the next step?

584
00:38:16,174 --> 00:38:19,337
It belongs to a 50-year-old
African-American woman.

585
00:38:19,377 --> 00:38:22,972
Well, that's obviously
a mistake.

586
00:38:23,014 --> 00:38:24,345
Not ours.

587
00:38:24,382 --> 00:38:25,974
I ran the number
you gave us.

588
00:38:26,017 --> 00:38:29,282
No, that's impossible.

589
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,288
Okay, run them
again, please?

590
00:38:31,322 --> 00:38:33,347
Dr. Bensley,
thank you for joining us.

591
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:35,359
I'd like to introduce you
to someone.

592
00:38:35,393 --> 00:38:38,988
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello.

593
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,999
Markham: Dr. Bensley is our
hospital psychiatrist.

594
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:44,126
I don't need
a psychiatrist.

595
00:38:44,168 --> 00:38:46,136
Did you get the prescription
I sent over?

596
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:48,934
I did. Quite a
potent dosage, Mary.

597
00:38:48,973 --> 00:38:51,771
Would you mind coming
with me for a moment?

598
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:53,606
Yes, actually, I would.

599
00:38:53,645 --> 00:38:57,274
It doesn't need to be
voluntary, Miss Walsh.

600
00:38:57,315 --> 00:39:00,250
Excuse me.
Excuse me!

601
00:39:00,284 --> 00:39:02,343
Right this way, please.

602
00:39:02,387 --> 00:39:04,787
This way.

603
00:39:04,822 --> 00:39:07,552
- Okay.
- Come on.

604
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:25,005
So you've been treated for psychiatric
issues before, hmm, Mary?

605
00:39:27,478 --> 00:39:29,912
Answer the question,
Miss Walsh.

606
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,982
I...

607
00:39:33,518 --> 00:39:37,352
I checked myself in
when I was 22.

608
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:42,726
I was in grad school.
I was under a lot of stress.

609
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,729
I was there for three days.
That's it.

610
00:39:45,763 --> 00:39:48,027
I don't see how
that's relevant.

611
00:39:48,066 --> 00:39:51,502
What are you doing
on antidepressants?

612
00:39:51,536 --> 00:39:53,970
Oh, you think
I'm making this up.

613
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:57,699
You think that,

614
00:39:57,742 --> 00:40:00,711
what, my imaginary
boyfriend went missing?

615
00:40:00,745 --> 00:40:02,679
You're an only child.

616
00:40:02,714 --> 00:40:04,409
Your father left
when you were young.

617
00:40:04,449 --> 00:40:07,907
Your mother died
earlier this year

618
00:40:07,952 --> 00:40:09,715
in a hospital.

619
00:40:09,754 --> 00:40:13,155
Yes, February.

620
00:40:13,191 --> 00:40:16,251
She went in
for a routine check-up

621
00:40:16,294 --> 00:40:18,057
and never checked out.

622
00:40:18,096 --> 00:40:20,564
She had a blood infection.

623
00:40:20,598 --> 00:40:22,930
So it's not surprising
that your subconscious

624
00:40:22,967 --> 00:40:25,731
would choose a hospital
to fabricate-

625
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:29,206
It's not my subconscious
anything.

626
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,071
Oh my Lord!

627
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:33,634
This is real.

628
00:40:36,047 --> 00:40:38,572
He was there for me.

629
00:40:38,616 --> 00:40:41,551
You know, I remember
her funeral.

630
00:40:41,586 --> 00:40:44,316
- He was at it.
- Kevin?

631
00:40:44,355 --> 00:40:46,323
Yes, Kevin.

632
00:40:46,357 --> 00:40:49,952
I know it's hard to lose somebody
you care deeply about, Mary.

633
00:40:49,994 --> 00:40:52,656
It's very understandable
how someone in your situation

634
00:40:52,697 --> 00:40:54,494
could suffer
a psychological break.

635
00:40:54,532 --> 00:40:56,397
You work long hours.

636
00:40:56,434 --> 00:40:58,493
You've lost your emotional
support system. You're alone.

637
00:40:58,536 --> 00:41:00,504
It's only natural for the brain
to reach for something,

638
00:41:00,538 --> 00:41:02,165
anything, to grab onto.

639
00:41:02,206 --> 00:41:04,401
He drove us here.

640
00:41:04,442 --> 00:41:05,966
He did.

641
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:09,639
And I remember the ride
like the back of my hand.

642
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,978
He- he- he was-

643
00:41:12,016 --> 00:41:14,143
He was chewing on the lid
of his coffee cup.

644
00:41:14,185 --> 00:41:17,951
- It's this little nervous habit that he has.
- Sorry.

645
00:41:17,989 --> 00:41:19,456
I know that it all
must seem real.

646
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:21,822
It seems real
because it is real!

647
00:41:23,094 --> 00:41:26,621
I remember walking through
the parking structure.

648
00:41:26,664 --> 00:41:29,758
Memory is a very vivid
and powerful sensation, Mary.

649
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:31,268
It is real!

650
00:41:31,302 --> 00:41:33,634
This whole situation
is real.

651
00:41:33,671 --> 00:41:36,105
And he's here.
He was here,

652
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,405
He's somewhere
right now in this hospital

653
00:41:39,443 --> 00:41:41,638
and we're wasting time!

654
00:41:43,214 --> 00:41:46,581
The nurse advised me
to get coffee,

655
00:41:46,617 --> 00:41:48,778
said the surgery
would be an hour.

656
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:52,256
It was 25 minutes,
and he's gone.

657
00:41:53,591 --> 00:41:55,058
It was real.

658
00:41:55,092 --> 00:41:57,356
It's all right, Mary.

659
00:41:57,395 --> 00:41:59,363
Can I just have
a moment alone?

660
00:41:59,397 --> 00:42:01,365
Take all the time
you need, dear.

661
00:42:01,399 --> 00:42:03,594
I'll be in my office
next door.

662
00:42:03,634 --> 00:42:05,727
Okay.

663
00:42:56,654 --> 00:42:58,747
Mary, I-

664
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,458
Security.

665
00:43:37,561 --> 00:43:39,552
Want some company?

666
00:43:47,538 --> 00:43:50,905
Do you know I was just here
for a checkup today?

667
00:43:52,643 --> 00:43:54,804
Doctor told me I need
to take it easy.

668
00:43:57,148 --> 00:43:58,843
Then you call.

669
00:43:58,883 --> 00:44:02,546
I gotta tell you, this job can really
take its toll on you-

670
00:44:03,654 --> 00:44:05,645
your health,
your marriage.

671
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:07,157
You're married?

672
00:44:07,191 --> 00:44:10,422
Was.

673
00:44:10,461 --> 00:44:13,828
Marriage, it can be
a funny thing, you know?

674
00:44:13,864 --> 00:44:17,322
You commit yourself,
you hand your heart over to someone,

675
00:44:17,368 --> 00:44:21,270
but it always seems like
it's the little things

676
00:44:21,305 --> 00:44:23,830
that keep
chipping away at it-

677
00:44:23,874 --> 00:44:26,399
Little disagreements.

678
00:44:26,444 --> 00:44:28,435
She-

679
00:44:28,479 --> 00:44:30,913
she hated the fact
that I was a cop.

680
00:44:30,948 --> 00:44:33,246
And you know what?

681
00:44:33,284 --> 00:44:36,185
Maybe-
maybe she was right.

682
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,710
I don't know.

683
00:44:40,257 --> 00:44:43,715
I was working a gang shooting
over in Glassell Park,

684
00:44:43,761 --> 00:44:46,389
and my partner and I,

685
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:48,898
we traced the shooter back
to his girlfriend's house.

686
00:44:48,933 --> 00:44:52,425
He'd been shacking up there
for a couple of weeks.

687
00:44:53,504 --> 00:44:55,472
And we had the kid cornered,
so we went in.

688
00:44:55,506 --> 00:44:58,168
He was unarmed,
gave himself right up.

689
00:45:02,713 --> 00:45:06,479
What we didn't know that his girlfriend
was in the house.

690
00:45:13,524 --> 00:45:16,550
The last thing I remember
before I blacked out...

691
00:45:19,497 --> 00:45:21,522
was watching my partner...

692
00:45:24,101 --> 00:45:26,899
his dark lifeless eyes

693
00:45:26,937 --> 00:45:29,030
as he fell to the floor.

694
00:45:37,848 --> 00:45:39,372
Now look at me.

695
00:45:39,417 --> 00:45:41,749
I've got a desk job
and high blood pressure

696
00:45:41,786 --> 00:45:45,517
and a doctor telling me
how to live my life.

697
00:45:45,556 --> 00:45:48,024
What I'm-

698
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:50,050
what I'm trying
to say here is that...

699
00:45:53,064 --> 00:45:56,329
I understand what
you're going through.

700
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:05,698
Can you please tell
Dr. Bensley

701
00:46:05,743 --> 00:46:07,734
that...

702
00:46:09,447 --> 00:46:13,110
he can just do whatever needs to do,
all right?

703
00:46:40,344 --> 00:46:42,335
Mary's behavior
is definitely indicative

704
00:46:42,379 --> 00:46:45,371
of someone in the midst
of an emotional breakdown.

705
00:46:45,416 --> 00:46:48,112
And yet I never met anyone
with such conviction

706
00:46:48,152 --> 00:46:50,450
in her delusion.

707
00:46:50,488 --> 00:46:53,321
She absolutely believes that everything
that's happening is real.

708
00:46:54,792 --> 00:46:57,886
She's emotionally lost.

709
00:47:05,703 --> 00:47:07,261
Yeah, this Bensley.

710
00:47:07,304 --> 00:47:10,899
Listen, I wanna put Mary Walsh
under 72-hour observation.

711
00:47:12,076 --> 00:47:15,307
Mm-hmm.
Possible mental illness.

712
00:47:43,607 --> 00:47:47,304
Mr. Holloway,
this is J.J.

713
00:47:47,344 --> 00:47:48,641
I have her
in the hallway.

714
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:50,874
Switching to camera 2.

715
00:47:50,915 --> 00:47:53,577
I'm following her
along the hallway.

716
00:47:54,952 --> 00:47:57,182
I have her.
- Do not lose her.

717
00:47:57,221 --> 00:48:00,622
Sir, it looks like she's heading towards
sublevel "B"- boiler room and laundry.

718
00:48:00,658 --> 00:48:02,819
We only have limited
coverage down there.

719
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:05,590
I'm en route right now.

720
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,838
Dr. Bensley, what are
we dealing with here?

721
00:48:57,881 --> 00:48:59,405
Is she dangerous?

722
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:01,077
It's impossible to say.

723
00:49:01,118 --> 00:49:03,985
Acute perception
of persecution, paranoia.

724
00:49:04,021 --> 00:49:06,888
You just never know
how someone like this will act

725
00:49:06,924 --> 00:49:09,119
when pushed too far.

726
00:49:14,698 --> 00:49:18,634
No, no.
No cameras, none.

727
00:49:18,669 --> 00:49:21,433
No parking lot.
No exits.

728
00:49:21,472 --> 00:49:23,337
No. I can't find
her anywhere.

729
00:49:23,374 --> 00:49:25,535
We only got a couple of cameras
operational in that area,

730
00:49:25,576 --> 00:49:27,771
so it's not gonna be easy.
I'm gonna keep on scanning.

731
00:49:27,811 --> 00:49:29,779
Wait, I think
I've got something.

732
00:49:29,813 --> 00:49:32,475
Boom! Camera 4 in the boiler room.
She's wearing blue scrubs.

733
00:49:32,516 --> 00:49:34,484
It looks like she's heading
towards the morgue.

734
00:49:34,518 --> 00:49:36,952
She's running. She's on the move.
I'm gonna lose her.

735
00:50:01,178 --> 00:50:03,703
You had a chance to talk with her.
Is she currently on meds?

736
00:50:03,747 --> 00:50:05,681
Yeah, quite
a potent dosage.

737
00:50:05,716 --> 00:50:08,913
Okay, so this could be some sort
of psychotic reaction.

738
00:50:08,952 --> 00:50:11,147
It could indeed.

739
00:50:18,996 --> 00:50:20,964
Hello.

740
00:50:20,998 --> 00:50:24,866
Kevin:
Hello, it's me.

741
00:50:24,902 --> 00:50:27,268
My God, Kevin.

742
00:50:27,304 --> 00:50:29,329
Where are you?

743
00:50:29,373 --> 00:50:31,898
I don't know.
Somewhere in the hospital.

744
00:50:33,477 --> 00:50:35,377
What's happening?

745
00:50:35,412 --> 00:50:37,539
Listen to me, okay?

746
00:50:37,581 --> 00:50:40,049
Don't trust anyone.

747
00:50:40,084 --> 00:50:42,143
I don't know how many people
are involved in this.

748
00:50:42,186 --> 00:50:43,847
It's very important,
okay?

749
00:50:43,887 --> 00:50:46,720
- What do they want?
- I don't know.

750
00:50:46,757 --> 00:50:50,158
She has to be close by.
She couldn't have gone too far.

751
00:50:50,194 --> 00:50:53,357
Check all the rooms
on that wing.

752
00:50:53,397 --> 00:50:55,831
Look around you. Where are you?
Where are you right now?

753
00:50:55,866 --> 00:50:58,061
I'm in a bathroom
somewhere.

754
00:50:58,102 --> 00:50:59,729
Are you okay?
Are you safe?

755
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:01,635
Where are you?

756
00:51:01,672 --> 00:51:03,230
I don't- hold on.

757
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,204
Um...

758
00:51:11,248 --> 00:51:13,341
I'm in the morgue.

759
00:51:13,384 --> 00:51:15,852
- Can you get down here?
- No, no! Leave me alone!

760
00:51:15,886 --> 00:51:18,548
Kevin.

761
00:51:18,589 --> 00:51:22,025
Kevin. Kevin!

762
00:51:22,059 --> 00:51:24,254
Kevin.

763
00:51:34,571 --> 00:51:36,562
Miss Walsh.

764
00:51:38,075 --> 00:51:40,805
Miss Walsh, you in here?

765
00:52:29,726 --> 00:52:32,627
I got her. She's heading
towards the parking garage.

766
00:52:47,311 --> 00:52:49,370
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Are you all right?

767
00:52:49,413 --> 00:52:51,813
Are you all right?

768
00:52:51,849 --> 00:52:54,317
This is a first date.

769
00:52:54,351 --> 00:52:56,876
- We don't kiss on the first date.
- Third. Fifth date.

770
00:53:47,905 --> 00:53:49,964
Gonna wait?
This could take awhile.

771
00:53:54,878 --> 00:53:56,903
I think I've done
all I can do.

772
00:53:56,947 --> 00:54:00,110
Sorry she sent you
on such a wild goose chase.

773
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:03,779
Yeah, it happens.

774
00:54:05,689 --> 00:54:08,214
- Good afternoon, Doc.
- Detective.

775
00:54:41,124 --> 00:54:43,115
Cooper: Hi, Mary.

776
00:54:44,828 --> 00:54:47,058
- Hello.
- Shh.

777
00:54:48,398 --> 00:54:51,367
I heard what happened.
These are for you.

778
00:54:53,704 --> 00:54:56,502
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

779
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:59,338
The doctor thought you needed
some more time to recuperate.

780
00:54:59,376 --> 00:55:02,106
The cop- I think
he might have left.

781
00:55:02,145 --> 00:55:04,238
Thank you.

782
00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:10,787
They think I'm crazy.

783
00:55:10,821 --> 00:55:12,516
I'm not.

784
00:55:12,556 --> 00:55:14,148
I'm not crazy.

785
00:55:14,191 --> 00:55:17,683
No, you're not crazy.
That's why I came down here.

786
00:55:17,728 --> 00:55:19,923
I want to discuss the situation
about Kevin

787
00:55:19,963 --> 00:55:21,931
and how you could
see him again.

788
00:55:21,965 --> 00:55:23,592
You do wanna see
him again, right?

789
00:55:23,634 --> 00:55:25,101
Do you know
where he is?

790
00:55:25,135 --> 00:55:27,660
Now don't get yourself
worked up, young lady.

791
00:55:30,007 --> 00:55:32,908
You did make quite a spectacle
of yourself, Miss Walsh.

792
00:55:32,943 --> 00:55:35,673
The emotional outburst,
the panicking.

793
00:55:35,712 --> 00:55:38,806
We expected that,
but the accident.

794
00:55:38,849 --> 00:55:42,046
Oh, my my, Mary, I mean,
you've got to be more careful.

795
00:55:45,555 --> 00:55:49,514
"Mary Catherine Walsh, unmarried,
regional operations manager

796
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:51,652
for the Empyrean
International Bank. "

797
00:55:51,695 --> 00:55:55,062
You rent a condo in Reseda.
Your mother died four months ago,

798
00:55:55,098 --> 00:55:58,192
but the bank got your house
in the reverse mortgage.

799
00:55:58,235 --> 00:56:00,863
That's true.

800
00:56:00,904 --> 00:56:04,465
- How do you know this?
- I did my research.

801
00:56:04,508 --> 00:56:06,066
But your bank,
on the other hand,

802
00:56:06,109 --> 00:56:08,407
recently received
from the federal government

803
00:56:08,445 --> 00:56:10,379
a $2 billion bailout.

804
00:56:10,414 --> 00:56:12,939
Now I've seen
the bonus structure,

805
00:56:12,983 --> 00:56:14,883
rewarding
their executives

806
00:56:14,918 --> 00:56:18,081
while letting their customers
go bankrupt, huh?

807
00:56:18,121 --> 00:56:22,114
And you have access
to unlimited funds.

808
00:56:27,064 --> 00:56:30,659
Don't you hurt him.
Don't you hurt him!

809
00:56:34,104 --> 00:56:36,095
So...

810
00:56:37,574 --> 00:56:40,168
- How much?
- $10 million.

811
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:43,179
I've taken the liberty
to get Kevin's computer.

812
00:56:43,213 --> 00:56:46,774
Inside here you'll find the account
and wire routing numbers

813
00:56:46,817 --> 00:56:48,717
of a bank account
in the Cayman Islands.

814
00:56:48,752 --> 00:56:50,879
Once I receive confirmation
of funds received,

815
00:56:50,921 --> 00:56:53,446
I'll let your boyfriend go.

816
00:56:58,729 --> 00:57:00,754
Shit.

817
00:57:04,768 --> 00:57:06,395
I have no Wi-Fi signal.

818
00:57:06,436 --> 00:57:08,097
I checked it myself.
It's fine.

819
00:57:08,138 --> 00:57:10,072
Yeah, I don't have a wireless signal
in this room.

820
00:57:10,107 --> 00:57:11,972
I need a hard line.

821
00:57:12,008 --> 00:57:15,205
I need to move
to a different location.

822
00:57:15,245 --> 00:57:17,509
Yeah, it's me.

823
00:57:17,547 --> 00:57:19,242
Yeah, cut off
Peterson's finger.

824
00:57:19,282 --> 00:57:22,217
No, wait! Wait!
Tell him no.

825
00:57:22,252 --> 00:57:24,618
Look at this right here.

826
00:57:24,654 --> 00:57:27,521
This is our signal.
There is none.

827
00:57:27,557 --> 00:57:30,685
I've tried every
single network,

828
00:57:30,727 --> 00:57:33,218
- and there's nothing.
- Hold that for one second.

829
00:57:33,263 --> 00:57:35,731
I need you to move me
to a place

830
00:57:35,766 --> 00:57:38,166
where I can plug in
a different computer.

831
00:57:38,201 --> 00:57:39,998
I can get it done
in no time, okay?

832
00:57:40,036 --> 00:57:43,995
Yeah, all right.

833
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,338
I've got 26 minutes till the cutoff,
which is exactly how much time

834
00:57:46,376 --> 00:57:49,504
you've got to find a computer
to get me my money.

835
00:57:49,546 --> 00:57:51,639
You're being watched.
We know everything you do.

836
00:57:51,681 --> 00:57:54,343
If you fail, Kevin dies.

837
00:57:54,384 --> 00:57:56,352
If you tell anyone,
Kevin dies.

838
00:57:56,386 --> 00:57:59,219
If you leave the hospital,
Kevin dies.

839
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:01,923
Got it.

840
00:58:01,958 --> 00:58:04,483
Here's your clothing.
I found it downstairs.

841
00:58:04,528 --> 00:58:08,020
Meet me on sublevel "B"
when you're done.

842
00:58:09,866 --> 00:58:11,629
Wonderful.

843
00:58:56,112 --> 00:58:58,103
Miss Walsh?

844
00:59:31,147 --> 00:59:34,378
Mr. Holloway, that crazy
Mary Walsh lady is back

845
00:59:34,417 --> 00:59:36,385
wandering the halls.

846
00:59:36,419 --> 00:59:38,387
She's looking for a patient
that does not appear to be in our system.

847
00:59:38,421 --> 00:59:40,389
She needs be escorted
out immediately.

848
00:59:40,423 --> 00:59:42,414
- I'll alert Miss Markham.
- Thank you.

849
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:19,925
We have footage of Miss Walsh
in the trauma recovery room.

850
01:00:19,963 --> 01:00:21,931
J.J., punch up everything on level 3,
would you, please?

851
01:00:21,965 --> 01:00:23,626
- Thank you.
- You got it.

852
01:00:26,469 --> 01:00:29,302
- Holloway: There you go.
- I wanted somebody on that door.

853
01:00:29,339 --> 01:00:31,307
Unfortunately,
the nurse stepped away.

854
01:00:31,341 --> 01:00:33,332
You don't really think
she's dangerous, do you?

855
01:00:33,376 --> 01:00:35,344
I'm not taking
any chances.

856
01:00:35,378 --> 01:00:38,211
Besides, with her injuries,
her well-being is my responsibility.

857
01:00:38,248 --> 01:00:40,273
Trust me. She's still here,
and we will find her.

858
01:00:40,317 --> 01:00:42,842
I have my people turning
this place upside down.

859
01:00:42,886 --> 01:00:44,478
Well, let me know the minute
you hear anything.

860
01:00:44,521 --> 01:00:46,079
I'm going back upstairs.

861
01:00:46,122 --> 01:00:48,522
You got it, Miss Markham.
Thank you.

862
01:01:57,293 --> 01:01:59,056
$10 million.

863
01:02:03,566 --> 01:02:05,761
$10 million.

864
01:02:43,173 --> 01:02:44,800
Please work.

865
01:04:04,854 --> 01:04:07,482
Hello.

866
01:04:07,524 --> 01:04:09,617
Mary: Kevin.

867
01:04:09,659 --> 01:04:13,390
- Mary, Mary.
- Oh, Kevin.

868
01:04:15,398 --> 01:04:17,161
Are you hurt?

869
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,690
He's fine.

870
01:04:18,735 --> 01:04:20,635
Let him go.

871
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:24,071
- The receipt.
- I need to email a confirmation code

872
01:04:24,107 --> 01:04:25,904
to complete
the wire transfer.

873
01:04:25,942 --> 01:04:29,844
So I would suggest
that you let him go now.

874
01:04:50,466 --> 01:04:52,491
Move it!

875
01:04:54,637 --> 01:04:58,038
Honey.

876
01:04:58,074 --> 01:04:59,939
I thought I lost
you forever.

877
01:04:59,976 --> 01:05:01,603
The code, come on!

878
01:05:01,644 --> 01:05:04,272
Done.

879
01:05:04,314 --> 01:05:06,077
Come on, let's go
up those stairs.

880
01:05:06,115 --> 01:05:09,243
We could get away.
Just go right up those stairs.

881
01:05:16,659 --> 01:05:18,752
Well, I'm glad
you made it safely.

882
01:05:18,795 --> 01:05:20,262
I understand you're from Missouri.
Is that correct?

883
01:05:20,296 --> 01:05:21,422
Yeah, Kansas City.

884
01:05:21,464 --> 01:05:24,456
- Is that near St. Louis?
- Other side of the state.

885
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,161
Excuse me one second.

886
01:05:26,202 --> 01:05:27,931
Royal Cayman Bank & Trust.
This is Barry.

887
01:05:27,971 --> 01:05:31,463
Yeah, Conyers.
Yeah, it's me.

888
01:05:31,507 --> 01:05:33,031
Did it go through?

889
01:05:33,076 --> 01:05:36,307
Yes, sir. As a matter of fact,
it's pending right now.

890
01:05:36,346 --> 01:05:38,871
We're on, guys.

891
01:05:38,915 --> 01:05:40,473
Thank you, Miss Walsh.

892
01:05:44,921 --> 01:05:46,548
Great work, baby.

893
01:05:46,589 --> 01:05:50,150
I mean, fantastic.

894
01:05:53,429 --> 01:05:55,659
Kevin: It's a good thing too.
Just in time,

895
01:05:55,698 --> 01:05:58,667
'cause this brace is really starting
to make my leg really stiff.

896
01:06:01,137 --> 01:06:03,105
Kevin,
what are you doing?

897
01:06:03,139 --> 01:06:06,165
Cooper: Haven't you been paying any
attention? There is no Kevin Peterson.

898
01:06:07,343 --> 01:06:09,106
Kevin.

899
01:06:11,314 --> 01:06:13,009
Oh my God.
Where are you?

900
01:06:13,049 --> 01:06:16,849
I don't know.
I'm in the hospital somewhere.

901
01:06:16,886 --> 01:06:18,854
Can you get down here?

902
01:06:18,888 --> 01:06:21,482
- No, no, leave me alone!
- Kevin.

903
01:06:22,992 --> 01:06:26,655
There is no...

904
01:06:26,696 --> 01:06:29,665
Kevin Peterson.

905
01:06:31,067 --> 01:06:33,968
Kevin, Kevin!

906
01:06:37,173 --> 01:06:38,197
Kevin.

907
01:06:42,178 --> 01:06:45,614
Don't you hurt him.
Don't you hurt him.

908
01:06:45,648 --> 01:06:47,115
Oh, my.

909
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:50,278
So how much?

910
01:06:56,592 --> 01:06:59,026
Franklin: What about the nurse,

911
01:06:59,062 --> 01:07:01,121
this Amanda?

912
01:07:01,164 --> 01:07:03,530
- So you must be Kevin Peterson.
- Yeah.

913
01:07:03,566 --> 01:07:05,534
- I'm Amanda.
- Markham: We don't have anyone

914
01:07:05,568 --> 01:07:08,059
- by that name.
- See you in an hour.

915
01:07:09,105 --> 01:07:11,232
- Mary: Lovely nurse came in to prep him.
- What was the nurse's name?

916
01:07:11,274 --> 01:07:13,401
Mary: Uh, no...
Amanda.

917
01:07:13,443 --> 01:07:17,243
- My boyfriend is Kevin Peterson...
- Come here, come here.

918
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,145
...and we can't find him.

919
01:07:19,182 --> 01:07:22,913
My wife,
she has breast cancer.

920
01:07:22,952 --> 01:07:25,887
Well, she's up in chemo.

921
01:07:25,922 --> 01:07:28,220
That's him
right there.

922
01:07:28,257 --> 01:07:31,055
Color accuracy is difficult to determine
with closed-circuit cameras.

923
01:07:31,094 --> 01:07:35,394
You know, Detective Franklin,
we have people here she can talk to.

924
01:07:35,431 --> 01:07:38,594
I'm sure Miss Markham could
arrange something, if need be.

925
01:07:38,634 --> 01:07:40,864
Mary:
Everything is a lie?

926
01:07:40,903 --> 01:07:43,201
Everything
is a lie?

927
01:07:43,239 --> 01:07:45,639
Every- every-
everything-

928
01:07:45,675 --> 01:07:49,611
- everything is a lie.
- Don't take it personally, Mare.

929
01:07:49,645 --> 01:07:52,375
- Mare bear.
- Don't touch me.

930
01:07:52,415 --> 01:07:54,576
The man you fell
in love with...

931
01:07:56,652 --> 01:07:58,415
he's not real.

932
01:07:58,454 --> 01:08:01,048
I'm a real idiot.

933
01:08:14,604 --> 01:08:17,937
Didn't he tell you about his time in prison?
That's where I met the guy.

934
01:08:17,974 --> 01:08:20,408
Believe me, if I was any younger,
I would have done this myself.

935
01:08:20,443 --> 01:08:23,537
No no no, Coop.
You couldn't handle her.

936
01:08:23,579 --> 01:08:26,104
She's a real tiger cat
between the sheets.

937
01:08:26,149 --> 01:08:28,743
Oh, I don't know, Coop.

938
01:08:28,785 --> 01:08:32,243
I think you could
have handled her.

939
01:08:33,856 --> 01:08:35,323
Holloway: All we had
to do was sit back

940
01:08:35,358 --> 01:08:38,088
and watch you lose it.
It was simple.

941
01:08:38,127 --> 01:08:41,494
Mare bear,
for old times' sake.

942
01:08:41,531 --> 01:08:44,125
- Come on in.
- Don't you dare touch me.

943
01:08:44,167 --> 01:08:46,727
- Don't touch me.
- Allow me.

944
01:08:46,769 --> 01:08:48,964
Boys, I think
it's time to go.

945
01:08:49,005 --> 01:08:51,906
All right, Holloway,
you know the drill.

946
01:08:51,941 --> 01:08:53,408
Amanda.

947
01:08:53,443 --> 01:08:55,775
I'll send you a postcard.

948
01:09:01,083 --> 01:09:03,313
I'm sorry.

949
01:09:14,197 --> 01:09:17,462
Victoria Markham's
office, please.

950
01:09:19,068 --> 01:09:22,094
It's Detective Franklin.
Tell her it's urgent.

951
01:09:22,138 --> 01:09:25,005
What do you mean she disappeared?
Where'd she go?

952
01:09:26,676 --> 01:09:29,702
Look, I think she's telling us the truth
about her boyfriend.

953
01:09:29,745 --> 01:09:31,713
She's messed up in something.
I don't know what it is.

954
01:09:31,747 --> 01:09:34,511
I think she's in some kind of trouble.
Just find her.

955
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:37,144
Just find her!
I'm on my way there right now.

956
01:09:52,568 --> 01:09:55,059
Whoo!

957
01:09:55,104 --> 01:09:57,698
$10 million feels good,
doesn't it, babe?

958
01:09:57,740 --> 01:09:59,332
Baby, gimme a kiss.

959
01:10:15,424 --> 01:10:18,689
You know,
I almost feel bad.

960
01:10:18,728 --> 01:10:21,253
Amanda:
Oh, yeah, why is that?

961
01:10:21,297 --> 01:10:25,290
Almost, but I can think of
10 million reasons why not.

962
01:10:26,469 --> 01:10:29,768
Come on! Up!

963
01:10:29,805 --> 01:10:31,739
Get up those stairs.
Come on!

964
01:10:31,774 --> 01:10:35,471
Don't fight me!

965
01:10:35,511 --> 01:10:38,878
Yeah, you're a fighter,
ain't you?

966
01:10:42,451 --> 01:10:46,285
I believe Stevie once said
you were an animal in bed.

967
01:10:46,322 --> 01:10:49,291
Easy easy.

968
01:10:49,325 --> 01:10:51,520
Shh!

969
01:10:51,561 --> 01:10:56,527
Yeah.

970
01:10:56,566 --> 01:10:58,227
Damn, you're fine.

971
01:10:58,267 --> 01:11:01,293
I wanna show you something.

972
01:11:01,337 --> 01:11:03,362
- All right.
- Yeah.

973
01:11:03,406 --> 01:11:05,806
Maybe I shouldn't let
you go just yet.

974
01:11:08,578 --> 01:11:10,273
What are you reaching
for down there?

975
01:11:10,313 --> 01:11:12,645
- It's my phone.
- What about your phone?

976
01:11:12,682 --> 01:11:15,708
The transfer.

977
01:11:15,751 --> 01:11:18,481
You know they were talking
about the transfer?

978
01:11:18,521 --> 01:11:20,648
Yeah, what about it?

979
01:11:20,690 --> 01:11:22,317
It's still pending.

980
01:11:22,358 --> 01:11:25,759
Really? You pulling another one
of your tiger moves?

981
01:11:25,795 --> 01:11:28,320
- Is that it?
- I could take that money

982
01:11:28,364 --> 01:11:30,491
and I could transfer it
right into your account

983
01:11:30,533 --> 01:11:32,501
with just the click
of a button.

984
01:11:32,535 --> 01:11:34,730
What do you mean
I could have the money?

985
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:36,704
I'll prove it to you.
I'll do it right here. Look.

986
01:11:36,739 --> 01:11:39,503
Slowly, do it slowly.

987
01:11:39,542 --> 01:11:43,171
Let me see. Oh!

988
01:12:05,768 --> 01:12:09,534
Mary,
where's my little lamb?

989
01:12:10,873 --> 01:12:14,138
Mary!
Where you at?

990
01:12:26,055 --> 01:12:28,046
Holloway:
Mary!

991
01:12:29,258 --> 01:12:32,352
Mary.

992
01:12:35,097 --> 01:12:37,531
We got 23 exits.

993
01:12:37,566 --> 01:12:40,330
We checked 22.

994
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:52,170
Really? You think
I did a good job?

995
01:12:52,248 --> 01:12:54,341
Yes, you in the naughty
nurse's outfit

996
01:12:54,383 --> 01:12:57,181
was
really something.

997
01:12:57,219 --> 01:12:59,744
Thanks, baby.
I was so nervous.

998
01:12:59,789 --> 01:13:02,553
Hey, look,
don't get too excited.

999
01:13:02,591 --> 01:13:05,924
- Give Holloway a call.
- All right.

1000
01:13:23,079 --> 01:13:26,412
Kevin: Hello, Holloway.

1001
01:13:30,086 --> 01:13:33,180
Sounds like you're
out of breath.

1002
01:13:33,222 --> 01:13:35,554
Mare bear...

1003
01:13:35,591 --> 01:13:37,252
is that you?

1004
01:13:39,328 --> 01:13:42,661
I can hear you breathing.

1005
01:13:42,698 --> 01:13:44,188
And I know your breath.

1006
01:13:44,233 --> 01:13:47,031
Where's Holloway?

1007
01:13:47,069 --> 01:13:50,869
You didn't kill
Holloway, did you?

1008
01:13:50,906 --> 01:13:54,433
I didn't know
you had it in you.

1009
01:13:54,477 --> 01:13:56,536
Mary.

1010
01:13:56,579 --> 01:13:58,240
Mary, listen to me.

1011
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,646
I'm coming for you, Mary.
I'm coming down there.

1012
01:14:00,683 --> 01:14:03,174
You just stay put, sweets.
We can sort this all out.

1013
01:14:03,219 --> 01:14:05,380
I'm coming for you.
Damn it!

1014
01:14:05,421 --> 01:14:07,912
Holloway screwed up.
She's not dead.

1015
01:14:07,957 --> 01:14:11,085
Just relax. I'll get the money, okay?
We'll get the money!

1016
01:14:11,127 --> 01:14:13,095
I thought you said
you knew this chick, Steve.

1017
01:14:13,129 --> 01:14:16,064
I do. I told you, she's smart.

1018
01:14:16,098 --> 01:14:19,556
- Hello.
- Barry: I'm afraid there's been a problem.

1019
01:14:19,602 --> 01:14:21,092
The wire's
been reversed.

1020
01:14:21,137 --> 01:14:22,502
Cooper:
What are you talking about?

1021
01:14:22,538 --> 01:14:24,506
The bank recalled
the money.

1022
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:26,872
Can't do that.

1023
01:14:26,909 --> 01:14:29,400
- It's not my call, sir.
- That's not good enough.

1024
01:14:29,445 --> 01:14:31,709
Sir, there's nothing more
that I can do, okay?

1025
01:14:31,747 --> 01:14:34,682
It's not on my end.
I did what you told me to do.

1026
01:14:34,717 --> 01:14:37,447
- I did what you asked me to do.
- I'll get them to rescind it.

1027
01:14:37,486 --> 01:14:39,613
Sir, do whatever
you have to do, sir.

1028
01:14:39,655 --> 01:14:42,647
I'm sorry.

1029
01:14:44,293 --> 01:14:47,160
We gotta go back.
Get us back to the hospital.

1030
01:14:47,196 --> 01:14:49,630
I'll take care
of it myself.

1031
01:14:49,665 --> 01:14:52,657
I'll put a bullet
in her head right now.

1032
01:14:52,701 --> 01:14:54,794
Turn around here.

1033
01:14:56,672 --> 01:14:58,640
Son of a bitch!

1034
01:15:28,571 --> 01:15:30,198
There she is!

1035
01:16:03,439 --> 01:16:05,737
End of the road, baby.

1036
01:16:05,774 --> 01:16:08,766
All right, you take the wheel.
Meet us topside.

1037
01:16:20,556 --> 01:16:23,286
Woman:
All units, three armed suspects

1038
01:16:23,325 --> 01:16:25,885
spotted in hospital parking garage
driving silver sedan.

1039
01:16:25,928 --> 01:16:28,624
All units respond.

1040
01:16:39,942 --> 01:16:43,309
Shh shh shh.
Wait wait.

1041
01:17:07,937 --> 01:17:09,734
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know.

1042
01:17:09,772 --> 01:17:12,002
- Where'd they go?
- They went that way.

1043
01:17:12,041 --> 01:17:14,771
- Chill out!
- You stay right here.

1044
01:17:14,810 --> 01:17:15,868
You hear me?
Right here!

1045
01:17:20,115 --> 01:17:22,743
I need backup
at County Hospital now.

1046
01:17:22,785 --> 01:17:25,652
Mary honey,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1047
01:17:55,484 --> 01:17:58,078
Mare bear.

1048
01:18:03,058 --> 01:18:06,118
No! No, don't hit her.
We need her information.

1049
01:18:06,161 --> 01:18:08,891
Honey, Mary.
He's sorry.

1050
01:18:15,337 --> 01:18:17,328
Mare.

1051
01:18:54,643 --> 01:18:56,076
Mary: Please stop!

1052
01:18:56,111 --> 01:18:59,342
Cooper, put the gun down.

1053
01:18:59,381 --> 01:19:01,576
You're a smart girl,
Walsh.

1054
01:19:01,617 --> 01:19:04,450
There's no good way out of this.
Don't be stupid.

1055
01:19:04,486 --> 01:19:07,455
I'm gonna put my gun down.

1056
01:19:07,489 --> 01:19:09,286
I'm gonna do it
right here.

1057
01:19:09,324 --> 01:19:12,760
I'll go my way.
You go yours, okay?

1058
01:19:14,329 --> 01:19:16,797
Drop your weapon,
Cooper.

1059
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:28,473
Coop...

1060
01:19:28,510 --> 01:19:30,501
you okay?

1061
01:19:50,732 --> 01:19:53,257
Kevin:
Whoa whoa whoa!

1062
01:19:53,302 --> 01:19:55,270
Where'd you get a gun,
honey?

1063
01:19:55,304 --> 01:19:57,329
Put it away.
Stay where you are.

1064
01:19:57,372 --> 01:20:01,240
Whoa whoa whoa.
Baby, I'll put this away.

1065
01:20:01,276 --> 01:20:03,608
Take it easy.

1066
01:20:03,645 --> 01:20:07,081
This is a whole
different side of you

1067
01:20:07,116 --> 01:20:08,947
I've never seen.

1068
01:20:08,984 --> 01:20:12,476
And how do you feel
about that side?

1069
01:20:12,521 --> 01:20:14,955
I like it.

1070
01:20:14,990 --> 01:20:16,924
I like it a lot.

1071
01:20:16,959 --> 01:20:19,427
Me too.

1072
01:20:19,461 --> 01:20:22,430
Baby, this whole thing
has gotten completely

1073
01:20:22,464 --> 01:20:24,261
out of hand.

1074
01:20:24,299 --> 01:20:25,994
You were never
supposed to get hurt.

1075
01:20:26,034 --> 01:20:28,025
Okay?

1076
01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:30,334
Look,
we can work this out.

1077
01:20:30,372 --> 01:20:33,535
Okay, listen,

1078
01:20:33,575 --> 01:20:36,942
forget these guys, okay?

1079
01:20:36,979 --> 01:20:40,210
Why don't you and I
just take the money?

1080
01:20:40,249 --> 01:20:41,978
You can resend it.

1081
01:20:42,017 --> 01:20:45,009
We'll take it. We can be anybody
we wanna be.

1082
01:20:45,053 --> 01:20:48,420
We can go anywhere we wanna go.
Think about that.

1083
01:20:50,692 --> 01:20:53,786
No no no,
it started off about money,

1084
01:20:53,829 --> 01:20:56,389
but now, I mean,

1085
01:20:56,431 --> 01:20:58,194
honey,
everything's changed.

1086
01:20:58,233 --> 01:21:01,361
I would hate for you

1087
01:21:01,403 --> 01:21:04,770
to see four months

1088
01:21:04,806 --> 01:21:07,604
of wasted time
and effort.

1089
01:21:07,643 --> 01:21:09,577
I would really hate it.

1090
01:21:09,611 --> 01:21:10,805
It would hurt me.

1091
01:21:10,846 --> 01:21:12,837
Yeah, that's what
I'm saying.

1092
01:21:12,881 --> 01:21:15,042
So you and I, we could take
the money together.

1093
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:19,019
Right here.

1094
01:21:19,054 --> 01:21:21,215
And it could happen
just with the push of a little button.

1095
01:21:21,256 --> 01:21:23,087
We can go
anywhere we want to.

1096
01:21:23,125 --> 01:21:26,026
We can be anybody
we want to.

1097
01:21:26,061 --> 01:21:27,926
Think about it.

1098
01:21:27,963 --> 01:21:31,865
Baby, that sounds
pretty fantastic.

1099
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:33,765
You...

1100
01:21:33,802 --> 01:21:35,997
always told me
I was priceless.

1101
01:21:36,038 --> 01:21:38,973
Baby, you are priceless...

1102
01:21:39,007 --> 01:21:40,838
to me.

1103
01:21:40,876 --> 01:21:43,242
Just didn't know

1104
01:21:43,278 --> 01:21:45,542
that I was
a $10 million catch!

1105
01:21:45,581 --> 01:21:47,742
No!

1106
01:21:50,285 --> 01:21:52,276
Mary.

1107
01:21:53,822 --> 01:21:56,791
See now, I'm gonna have
to break up with you.

1108
01:21:56,825 --> 01:21:58,258
For real!

1109
01:22:05,267 --> 01:22:07,258
Mare!

1110
01:22:17,579 --> 01:22:19,809
Mary.
Mary, don't move.

1111
01:22:19,848 --> 01:22:21,543
Stay right there!
Don't move.

1112
01:22:21,583 --> 01:22:24,074
I'm gonna come to you.
You're okay.

1113
01:22:24,119 --> 01:22:26,110
Stay right there.

1114
01:22:48,844 --> 01:22:50,835
Okay.

1115
01:22:54,149 --> 01:22:56,140
I'm sorry.

1116
01:22:58,453 --> 01:23:00,444
Thank you.

1117
01:23:40,662 --> 01:23:43,062
- Detective Franklin.
- Mm-hmm.

1118
01:23:43,098 --> 01:23:46,864
Before we go up there

1119
01:23:46,902 --> 01:23:49,268
and see all those people,

1120
01:23:49,304 --> 01:23:51,636
I just wanted to ask,

1121
01:23:51,673 --> 01:23:53,664
why did you believe me?

1122
01:23:57,012 --> 01:23:59,412
This.

1123
01:23:59,448 --> 01:24:01,541
You left it in the chapel.

1124
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:03,244
What about this?

1125
01:24:03,285 --> 01:24:05,753
The last chapter.
Take a look.

1126
01:24:12,027 --> 01:24:14,723
The whole thing,
it's right there.

1127
01:24:28,410 --> 01:24:31,538
Couldn't even come up
with something original.

1128
01:24:34,182 --> 01:24:37,310
Why don't you keep this
for evidence?

1129
01:24:37,352 --> 01:24:40,879
- You gonna be okay?
- Sure I am.

1130
01:24:40,922 --> 01:24:43,755
Gonna just keep on living

1131
01:24:43,792 --> 01:24:46,022
one day at a time.

1132
01:24:46,061 --> 01:24:49,292
- How about you?
- I called my wife.

1133
01:24:49,331 --> 01:24:52,061
- You did?
- You got me thinking.

1134
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:54,967
Maybe I let her go
too easily.

1135
01:24:55,003 --> 01:24:58,439
I am proud of you, kid.

1136
01:24:58,473 --> 01:25:01,067
Come on. Let's get you
to a real hospital.

1137
01:25:01,109 --> 01:25:05,045
- Okay?
- Then the games can really begin.
