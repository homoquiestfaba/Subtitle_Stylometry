1
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:00,828
Hey.
Hey.

2
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:42,636
Yes.

3
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,676
My mandate is to restore

4
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,981
some semblance of fiscal sanity
to this institution.

5
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,285
And if we're all
honest with each other,

6
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,053
we know that for a long time,

7
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:03,891
this festival has been
a costly exercise in nostalgia.

8
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:08,195
So if Professors
Cleary and Wasserman
deign to show up,

9
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:09,864
then you can pass this along.

10
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:13,566
Sorry I'm late.

11
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:15,669
Horse trouble.

12
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:19,840
Dr. Wasserman,

13
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:21,842
I've decided that the university

14
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:23,844
must immediately
withdraw its support

15
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,578
for the Annual
Literary Festival.

16
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:28,049
I know you're all disappointed.

17
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:29,884
But let's be
honest with ourselves.

18
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:33,620
We can't even attract
a writer with enough stature

19
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:36,223
to inspire
even modest attendance.

20
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:39,860
I remember
when all the great ones
used to come here.

21
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:40,794
Updike.

22
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:43,331
That was a banner year.

23
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,333
We--
We should invite him.

24
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,134
He's dead, Arthur.

25
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:49,170
Oh, That's sad.

26
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:53,207
Wait, where are you going?
Wait, wait, wait.

27
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:54,574
You're too late.

28
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,278
The axe has fallen on
our literary enterprise,

29
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:01,048
and before you stands
the grim figure
of the executioner.

30
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:04,617
Oh, so you're willing to
give up the literary event
of the decade.

31
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,653
I'm sorry, Professor.
I've made my decision.

32
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:10,891
Really? So what if I told you
that the man who is coming
to this year's festival

33
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:13,727
will put us back
on the literary map?

34
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,695
I can't imagine
who that might be.

35
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,598
Excuse me,
isn't that sort of your job?
I just--

36
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:21,936
Okay, Simone, who is it?

37
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:26,606
Who's the writer that went MIA,

38
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:33,347
vanished, for 20 years
after the publication
of his masterpiece?

39
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:36,317
J.D. Salinger. It's Salinger!

40
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,684
Dead, Arthur.

41
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,854
Shriver.

42
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:40,988
Shriver.

43
00:03:41,122 --> 00:03:42,289
Shriver?

44
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:44,624
Shriver?
I thought he was dead.

45
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:58,005
Shriver,
it's the goddamn toilet again.

46
00:04:07,882 --> 00:04:09,083
Can you hurry up?

47
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:11,218
I'm about to
miss my window here.

48
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:23,924
<i>I got this letter.</i>

49
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:26,293
You got a letter?

50
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,296
Now, are you in trouble?

51
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,168
"Dear, Mr. Shriver,
it is my pleasure

52
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:37,704
on behalf of the festival
committee of Acheron University

53
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:42,309
to invite you to participate
in our literary festival
this year."

54
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:45,980
Invite-- Wait a minute,
you to participate?

55
00:05:46,614 --> 00:05:47,780
"As your work..."

56
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:51,085
"...your work is controversial."

57
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:53,220
What do they mean?
I don't--
I don't know.

58
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:56,524
I-- I think they think
I'm someone else.
I don't know.

59
00:05:56,656 --> 00:06:00,327
"The theme of which
is Truths, Fictions
and Alternative Facts.

60
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:05,266
It's al-- It's also,
auspiciously,
the 20th anniversary

61
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:09,103
of the publication
of your masterpiece,

62
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:11,138
<i>Goat Time.</i>

63
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,673
We are also
pleased to award you

64
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:18,112
this year's Acher--
Acheron Prize
for Literary Achievement.

65
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:21,849
Sincerely,
Professor Simone Cleary."

66
00:06:25,186 --> 00:06:27,687
<i>Goat Time.</i>
What kind of title is that?

67
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:30,291
You don't know <i>Goat Time?</i>
No, I don't know <i>Goat Time.</i>

68
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:33,726
I mean, like,
everybody read <i>Goat Time,</i> man.

69
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:35,695
That lady,
she read <i>Goat Time.</i>

70
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:38,098
This dude--
Hey, did you read <i>Goat Time?</i>

71
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,400
<i>Goat Time?</i>

72
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,768
What's it about?

73
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,637
What?
<i>Goat Time.</i>

74
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,339
I don't know.
I didn't read it.

75
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:50,945
Someone's messing with me.

76
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,146
Yeah?

77
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:55,115
Maybe it's one of
my ex-wife's friends.

78
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:57,818
Maybe.
Nah.

79
00:06:57,952 --> 00:07:00,521
Look, I know how to settle this.

80
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:03,424
Are you finished?
Oh, hey, yeah.
How are you? Yeah.

81
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:04,791
Thank you.

82
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,963
One way
to get to the bottom of this...

83
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:12,967
"Dear Mrs..."

84
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:16,604
No, that don't sound good.

85
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:20,207
"Dear... Professor."

86
00:07:20,341 --> 00:07:21,575
Right? Right?

87
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,877
No, no, no, no, no.

88
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:28,315
"Dear Dr. Clearly,

89
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:30,117
it would be..."

90
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:31,719
"...my pleasure to attend

91
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:34,655
your most esteemed
and prestigious festival

92
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:38,425
and to address the issues
of Truths, Fictions
and Alternative Facts,

93
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,894
which is totally my thing.

94
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:44,164
Uh, In fact, I was carrying on
to my good friend, Lenny,

95
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:47,835
about that
aforementioned subject
just this morning.

96
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:51,205
Also, is the prize a car?

97
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:54,441
Just wondering because..."

98
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,544
Okay.

99
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:02,483
Well, he goes on
about the car and, uh...

100
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:11,025
We're all very familiar
with Mr. Shriver's
subversive sense of humor.

101
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,928
You know,
I recall reading
an article about Shriver

102
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:18,798
several years ago in a--
in a journal--
I can't remember which one.

103
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:20,734
It was
The Journal of
Comparative Linguistics.

104
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:22,436
It doesn't really matter.

105
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:25,906
But the article was
making an interesting
point of comparison

106
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,608
between...
I wrote the article.

107
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:30,311
...Shriver's <i>Goat Time</i>
and James Joyce's <i>Ulysses.</i>

108
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:32,379
Now--
I wrote the fucking article, T.

109
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:33,681
Oh, really?

110
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:36,550
I still don't think
that this is a very good idea.

111
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:38,786
Yeah, he sounds like a lunatic.

112
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:41,288
And this the world calls frenzy.

113
00:08:41,422 --> 00:08:44,491
But the wise
have a far deeper madness,

114
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:49,063
and the glance of melancholy
is a fearful gift.

115
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:50,898
Byron, right?

116
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,166
Let's give up.

117
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:55,102
Just keep churning out
worthless degrees

118
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,371
to anyone
who will pay the tuition.

119
00:08:57,504 --> 00:09:00,708
One year, I--
I invited Philip Roth.

120
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:02,076
Fine.

121
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,345
But this is on you, Simone.

122
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:07,648
Bring Shriver and bring a crowd,

123
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:11,518
because this is
the last chance
for this festival.

124
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:14,455
He never wrote back.

125
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,425
<i>Dear Mr. Shriver,</i>

126
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,427
<i>I can't tell you</i>
<i>how delighted we all are</i>

127
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,529
<i>that you've accepted</i>
<i>our invitation.</i>

128
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:25,666
Write her back.
Tell her I'm not coming.
You write her back.

129
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,534
I'm not a writer.

130
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:29,970
<i>It's so hard</i>
<i>to keep these festivals alive,</i>

131
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:31,972
<i>so your response</i>
<i>has lifted our spirits.</i>

132
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:33,540
Everyone's a writer these days.

133
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:35,776
When was the last time
you went to Starbucks?

134
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,113
<i>On behalf of lovers</i>
<i>of literature</i>
<i>everywhere, I thank you.</i>

135
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,448
<i>And I hope</i>
<i>this is not too forward of me,</i>

136
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,350
<i>but it would be wonderful</i>
<i>if you could perhaps</i>

137
00:09:43,484 --> 00:09:45,619
<i>share a piece</i>
<i>of new writing with us.</i>

138
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:48,055
<i>- I don't write.
- </i> <i>Most writers</i> <i>don't write.</i>

139
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:50,157
All they do is complain
about not writing,

140
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,259
then they write about
not writing.

141
00:09:53,394 --> 00:09:56,230
<i>And they're depressed.</i>
<i>You're always depressed.</i>

142
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:26,627
<i>Looks like we're having</i>
<i>a crisis of inspiration.</i>

143
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:28,595
Mmm.

144
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,934
<i>Oh, I know,</i>
<i>it's that you're a drunk</i>

145
00:10:34,836 --> 00:10:36,437
<i>and an impostor.</i>

146
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,944
You just happen to
share a name
with the writer.

147
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:46,547
The arrogance.

148
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,583
They asked me
to write something.

149
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,118
It's ridiculous.

150
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,120
Put down the pencil,

151
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:55,589
have a drink.

152
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:22,249
<i>The watermark</i>
<i>appeared on my ceiling</i>

153
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:25,552
<i>on the rainy day</i>
<i>my wife walked out on me.</i>

154
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,561
<i>At first it was just a spot,</i>

155
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:37,030
<i>approximately the size</i>
<i>of a quarter,</i>

156
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:40,234
<i>directly above the bed</i>
<i>where I lay weeping.</i>

157
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,269
<i>Listening to the rain fall,</i>

158
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:43,905
<i>I watched the watermark grow</i>

159
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:47,007
<i>ever so slowly</i>
<i>to the size of...</i>

160
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:11,565
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>welcome to Salt Lake City.</i>

161
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:15,202
<i>Those with connecting flights</i>
<i>to Acheron</i>
<i>proceed to gate 17.</i>

162
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:17,271
Sorry.

163
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:20,641
Oh, my God! Sorry, honey.

164
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,151
Yep. Okay.

165
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:42,095
Hey.
Hi.

166
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,064
Oh, my God.

167
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:19,566
Ma'am.
What? What? Sorry.

168
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,469
Do you need to
go to the lavatory?
No.

169
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:24,538
Are-- Are you gonna vomit?

170
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:28,675
I was, uh, wondering
if you could do me a favor.

171
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:31,445
Can you read this?

172
00:13:32,847 --> 00:13:35,016
What the hell?
Is this some kind of test?

173
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,385
No. I mean, is it legible?

174
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,832
Your penmanship is terrible.

175
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,773
"The watermark
appeared on my ceiling..."

176
00:14:02,043 --> 00:14:03,276
That's right.

177
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:06,580
Are you a writer?

178
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:10,150
Nah.

179
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,957
I know who you are.

180
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,458
You do?
Yes, I do.

181
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,762
See?

182
00:14:21,896 --> 00:14:25,732
Well, I mean,
it doesn't exactly
look like you, does it?

183
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:28,235
You-- You seem to
let yourself go a little bit,

184
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:34,574
but this is the only picture
anyone has ever seen
of the mysterious Shriver.

185
00:14:36,878 --> 00:14:37,845
I'm Delta Jones.

186
00:14:37,979 --> 00:14:39,113
Hi.

187
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:41,381
I-- I'm also writing
a memoir myself.

188
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,484
I go to this festival
every year.

189
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:47,220
Oh, and actually,
if you wouldn't mind...

190
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:53,895
...I'd really appreciate it
if you could sign this.

191
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:56,998
You know what's crazy?

192
00:14:57,131 --> 00:15:00,001
I wasn't even gonna go
to the festival this year.

193
00:15:00,835 --> 00:15:03,071
Then I found out
that you were coming,

194
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:05,472
and I was like,
boom, there it is.

195
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:09,342
That's the sign.
That's what I said. I was like,
"That is the sign," you know,

196
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:13,380
because Shriver,
he will understand my work.
Yeah.

197
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:16,550
So, yeah, let me just
help you out here, um--

198
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:20,188
If you could,
just say it, "To Delta,"
like, right in that area.

199
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,491
And-- And, please, can you
try to make it remotely legible?
That'd be great.

200
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:35,535
I-- I can't. Sorry. I can't.

201
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:36,737
What?

202
00:15:37,972 --> 00:15:39,272
Maybe later?

203
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:41,475
O-- Okay. Yeah.

I can get you on a flight

Does that work?

221
00:16:57,819 --> 00:17:02,056
Vodka martini, slightly dirty,
three olives, please.

223
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:17,637
Excuse me?

00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:23,777
Well, martinis with gin

it's a kangaroo.

225
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:29,884
Well, I'm gonna enjoy
this vodka martini

226
00:17:30,017 --> 00:17:34,754
and then I just might order
another vodka martini.

227
00:17:36,023 --> 00:17:37,058
Sure.

228
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:40,928
Of course, if you go into
a bar these days
and ask for a kangaroo,

229
00:17:41,062 --> 00:17:45,599
you get some beer jockey
with a man bun looking at
you like you're insane,

230
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,635
so, you probably better off
just calling it, uh...

00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:50,104
Yeah.

232
00:17:50,238 --> 00:17:51,272

233
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:57,144

this whole exchange
was meaningless.

00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:25,405

240
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:28,075
No, not really.

242
00:18:31,913 --> 00:18:34,015

258
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:16,716
The prize.

259
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:20,888

How long can this possibly--
Ha!

264
00:20:49,517 --> 00:20:51,651
Here you are, Mr. Shriver.

265
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:53,220
And your room
is already paid for.

266
00:20:53,354 --> 00:20:55,956
May I just see a credit card
for incidentals?

267
00:20:57,391 --> 00:20:58,658
I don't have one.

268
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:03,130

that's not possible, sir.

00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:04,965
Uh,

270
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:08,169
it is. It's-- It's possible.

271
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,241
I just never got one.

272
00:21:17,078 --> 00:21:18,879

in the morning.

282
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,281

What's going on?
Do you need help with that?

294
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:47,667
No.
You've got to be careful,

295
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,238
'cause with these old locks,
you've got to actually
turn it to the left.

296

Ah, there you go.

297
00:22:55,242 --> 00:22:59,113
Oh, my God!
Why did they not give you
a nicer room than this?

298
00:22:59,246 --> 00:23:01,248
Oh, really, I'll be fine.

299
00:23:01,382 --> 00:23:03,951
Oh, my God, you know what?
Take my room.

300
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:07,588
Oh, my God, please, please,
just take my room.
It's way nicer than this.

I'm sure. Thank you.

304
00:23:13,994 --> 00:23:16,397
Okay. Well, just let me know
if you need anything. Okay?

305
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,665
I'll do that.
All right.

306
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,916
You almost blew it with that
lovely professor back there.

307
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:40,854

you can keep selling this farce
to everyone else?

308
00:23:46,594 --> 00:23:48,162
Not long, I imagine.

309
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:50,231
Hmm.

310
00:23:51,131 --> 00:23:54,068

that's a nice touch.

311
00:23:59,073 --> 00:24:01,108
I only wonder
if your little deception

312
00:24:01,242 --> 00:24:04,211
plays out as comedy
or a tragedy.

313
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,082
Is there any difference?

314
00:24:23,998 --> 00:24:25,833

00:26:20,714 --> 00:26:22,015
That's generous of him.

349
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:24,284
He can't pay people
to haul those things away.

350
00:26:24,418 --> 00:26:28,756
His last novel had
an 80-page meditation
on cutting hay, seriously.

351
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:31,392
And this guy
belongs to him as well.

352
00:26:31,525 --> 00:26:33,894
He can't drive
for obvious reasons.

353
00:26:44,204 --> 00:26:47,574
Listen, I'm sorry
if I got a little testy
with you yesterday.

354
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:50,177
I've just--
I've got a lot
riding on this festival.

355
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,045
Oh, no, I understand.
It's my fault.

356
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:54,047
So you ready for this?

357
00:26:54,748 --> 00:26:55,983
No.

358
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,785
Of course not.

359
00:26:57,918 --> 00:27:00,889
I'm going to try to make this
as painless as possible.

360
00:27:01,054 --> 00:27:02,689
I promise.
All right.

361
00:27:02,824 --> 00:27:04,425
Yeah, I mean that.

362
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,830
I'm a writer.
I-- I understand
the solitary activity of--

363
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:10,731
Huh. I didn't know
you were a writer.

364
00:27:10,865 --> 00:27:14,301
Well, right now, I'm a--
I'm a program administrator

365
00:27:14,435 --> 00:27:16,170
with a very
heavy teaching schedule,

366
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:19,273
but I-- I do carve out time
every day to write.

367
00:27:19,406 --> 00:27:20,641
Yeah.

368
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:23,845
Hey, sorry to interrupt.
Hi.

369
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:27,882
I have Mr. Shriver's
per diem for him.
Great. Yeah, this is Teresa.

370
00:27:28,015 --> 00:27:29,116
She's a graduate TA.

371
00:27:29,249 --> 00:27:30,784
Sorry about the coins.
We use the--

372
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:32,953
For me?
Yeah, or if you want to
just take that.

373
00:27:33,086 --> 00:27:36,156
We use the vending machines,
um, on campus
for the author expenses.

374
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,892
And then also right now...

375
00:27:38,025 --> 00:27:39,293
Teresa...
...at our b--

376
00:27:39,426 --> 00:27:40,461
Yeah, nice.

377
00:27:40,594 --> 00:27:42,563
Don't care.
Okay, cool. Yeah.

378
00:27:42,696 --> 00:27:46,733
Oh, you know who I spoke to
after I dropped you off,
was your Mr. Cheadum.

379
00:27:46,868 --> 00:27:49,102
Who?
Cheadum, your agent?

380
00:27:51,205 --> 00:27:54,775
Um, anyway, I can't even
tell you how excited he is
that you're back.

381
00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:56,777
And he wanted it
to be a surprise,

382
00:27:56,911 --> 00:28:00,280
but I gotta tell you, he's gonna
arrive on time for your reading.

383
00:28:09,924 --> 00:28:11,191
Shriver.
Oh, shit.

384
00:28:11,325 --> 00:28:12,726
No, no, no. It's--
Sorry.

385
00:28:12,861 --> 00:28:14,595
That's okay.
Shriver, this is unnecessary.

386
00:28:14,728 --> 00:28:16,630
She's got this.
This is what she's here for.
Okay.

387
00:28:16,763 --> 00:28:17,832
Sorry.

388
00:28:17,966 --> 00:28:19,700
Teresa,
you can pick those up.

389
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:34,748
Hi.

390
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:26,199
- Mr. Shriver, Mr. Shriver.
- Shriver.

391
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:28,903
If you could just
read my manuscript...
I know you're gonna love it.

392
00:29:29,037 --> 00:29:31,906
You don't have to read it.
You could just write something
in support.

393
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,108
I could even write it for you.
It'd be very simple.

394
00:29:44,785 --> 00:29:45,853
Shriver.

395
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:48,255
Hey, hey.

396
00:29:48,388 --> 00:29:49,356
...talk about it?

397
00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:51,059
I really appreciate this.

398
00:29:51,191 --> 00:29:52,759
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

399
00:29:52,894 --> 00:29:54,094
Thank you.
Sure.

400
00:29:54,227 --> 00:29:56,064
Jesus.
Sorry about that.

401
00:29:56,196 --> 00:29:58,032
It was a little overwhelming.
Yeah.

Are you familiar
with Blythe Brown's work?

00:30:25,026 --> 00:30:27,095
Oh, no.
I'm not familiar with that.

410
00:30:27,227 --> 00:30:31,065
Oh, well, I'll make sure you--
Teresa, make sure
he gets a copy of this book.

411
00:30:31,198 --> 00:30:33,400
It's okay.
You can hold on to it.

412

Thanks.

413
00:30:35,435 --> 00:30:36,838
<i>"She came to you.</i>

414
00:30:36,971 --> 00:30:41,742
You, Black man, cock daddy,
protector of the oppressor,

415
00:30:41,876 --> 00:30:46,279
your gun, your stick,
you took her hand,

416
00:30:46,413 --> 00:30:47,815
pressed her throat,

417
00:30:47,949 --> 00:30:49,449
inhaled her face

418
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:55,823
and took her and took her
until she could take no more."

419
00:31:06,433 --> 00:31:07,869
What a powerful reading.

420
00:31:08,002 --> 00:31:10,838
I'm sure you have
a lot of questions
for Ms. Brown,

421
00:31:10,972 --> 00:31:15,175
so, uh, if you please,
line up behind these two
microphones so we can begin.

422
00:31:19,746 --> 00:31:20,781
Anyone?

423
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:32,526
Don't be shy.

424
00:31:37,197 --> 00:31:39,232
Anybody? Um--

425
00:31:41,668 --> 00:31:43,704
Mr. Shriver has a question.

426
00:31:47,207 --> 00:31:48,775
What is it?

427
00:31:55,883 --> 00:31:56,851
Um--

428
00:32:08,062 --> 00:32:09,429
Have you ever...

429
00:32:11,231 --> 00:32:12,499
Uh--

430
00:32:12,632 --> 00:32:15,736
Have you ever considered
writing from a...

431
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,771
male point of view?

432
00:32:17,905 --> 00:32:20,674
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

433
00:32:20,808 --> 00:32:23,010
What did he say?

434
00:32:24,644 --> 00:32:25,847
Hmm.

435
00:32:28,482 --> 00:32:30,985
You know, Mr. Shriver,

436
00:32:31,986 --> 00:32:33,221
I suppose your question

437
00:32:33,353 --> 00:32:35,422
is precisely
what I should have expected

438
00:32:35,555 --> 00:32:38,525
from the man who wrote
that overhyped,

439
00:32:38,658 --> 00:32:42,429
adolescent, macho wet dream
you call a novel.

440
00:32:42,562 --> 00:32:45,233
Oh, how it
scandalized housewives...
Well, all right.

441
00:32:45,365 --> 00:32:47,101
...and enthralled
undergraduates.

442
00:32:47,235 --> 00:32:48,735
But let's face it, folks.

443
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,605
The only reason
we're even talking
about Mr. Shriver

444
00:32:51,738 --> 00:32:54,474
is for his famous
vanishing act.

445
00:32:54,608 --> 00:32:57,444
Oh, and to answer your question,

446
00:32:58,179 --> 00:33:01,381
why the fuck should I?

447
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:07,387
All right.

448
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:13,094
Never mind. I'm sure
you're right. Thank you
for sharing your poetry.

449
00:33:17,231 --> 00:33:20,067
There's another question
over there and then over here.

450
00:33:22,602 --> 00:33:25,338
Shriver, you old devil.

451
00:33:26,207 --> 00:33:28,042
Still causing trouble?

452
00:33:30,377 --> 00:33:31,511
Jack Blunt.

453
00:33:31,645 --> 00:33:32,847
I interviewed you
for <i>Rolling Stone</i>

454
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,283
back when <i>Goat Time</i>
was published.

455
00:33:35,415 --> 00:33:36,783
Hey, Blunt.

456
00:33:36,918 --> 00:33:39,519
That's a long time ago.
I hardly recognize you.

457
00:33:39,653 --> 00:33:41,588
Yeah, but we only
talked on the phone.

458
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:44,826
Oh, of course.
Sorry. Forgot.
No, that's no problem.

459
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:48,296
Hey, listen, do you have,
like, a few seconds
to chat real quick?

460
00:33:48,428 --> 00:33:50,832
I just need a few words
about why you decided

461
00:33:50,965 --> 00:33:53,633
to reemerge
onto the literary scene?

462
00:33:53,767 --> 00:33:54,936
I'm not doing interviews.

463
00:33:55,069 --> 00:33:57,404
Perfect.
You can give me an exclusive.

464
00:33:59,573 --> 00:34:02,043
I don't have anything to say.

465
00:34:03,177 --> 00:34:06,413
Come here for a second.
I'm-- I'm gonna level
with you. Um--

466
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:10,717
When I first interviewed you,
I was on staff at <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

467
00:34:10,852 --> 00:34:12,887
Do you wanna know
what I'm doing now?

468
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,322
Hmm.

469
00:34:14,454 --> 00:34:17,691
I'm working for some fucking
online magazine doing profiles

470
00:34:17,825 --> 00:34:20,627
of twentysomething
shit bag scribblers

471
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,663
who aren't fit
to lick the sweat
from your balls.

472
00:34:23,797 --> 00:34:25,900
Do you feel what I'm saying?

473
00:34:26,033 --> 00:34:29,369
I see that you've reconnected
with an old friend.

474
00:34:30,171 --> 00:34:31,504
Him?

475
00:34:32,874 --> 00:34:35,709
You-- You don't mind
doing this interview,
do you?

476
00:34:37,044 --> 00:34:38,678
Besides, you owe me one.

477
00:34:40,447 --> 00:34:41,715
I'll see you at dinner.

478
00:34:42,582 --> 00:34:44,018
I need a drink.

479
00:34:44,718 --> 00:34:46,120
Well, I'm the guy.

480
00:34:49,323 --> 00:34:54,195
Twenty years ago,
you burst onto the scene
with this huge fucking novel.

481
00:34:54,328 --> 00:34:55,462
You're everywhere.

482
00:34:55,595 --> 00:34:58,866
Front page reviews,
<i>Time, Newsweek.</i>

483
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,067
No pictures.

484
00:35:00,201 --> 00:35:01,936
The more you hide,
the more they write about you,

485
00:35:02,069 --> 00:35:04,471
the more the book sells.
But who is this guy?

486
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:07,707
Then you win
the National Book Award.
You don't show up to get it.

487
00:35:07,842 --> 00:35:10,510
Then it's the National Prize
for the Humanities.

488
00:35:10,644 --> 00:35:16,350
President Bill Clinton himself
is going to hang a medal
around your neck.

489
00:35:16,483 --> 00:35:18,718
Surely, you'll emerge for this.

490
00:35:18,853 --> 00:35:21,088
I rented a freaking tux.

491
00:35:21,222 --> 00:35:22,489
And then...

492
00:35:23,556 --> 00:35:24,926
And then?

493
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,561
And then nothing. You're gone.

494
00:35:28,695 --> 00:35:30,563
No Shriver. Poof!

495
00:35:30,697 --> 00:35:32,799
Like Keyser fucking Söze.

496
00:35:32,934 --> 00:35:34,368
I looked everywhere for you.

497
00:35:34,501 --> 00:35:38,005
Where have you been
all this time?
What you been doing?

498
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:39,907
This and that.
Writing?

499
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:41,775
Some.
What do you got? Books?

500
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:46,013
Novel, memoir, stories? What?

501
00:35:47,514 --> 00:35:51,651
Now, you show up
at this amateur-hour, shit show,
poor excuse for a festival?

502
00:35:51,785 --> 00:35:53,720
Come on. What is this?

503
00:35:53,854 --> 00:35:55,755
Doesn't make any sense.

504
00:35:59,226 --> 00:36:00,962
I'm on to you.

505
00:36:07,701 --> 00:36:09,203
I'm not Shriver.

506
00:36:09,937 --> 00:36:11,872
That's cute. That's--

507
00:36:12,006 --> 00:36:15,843
No. I mean, I'm a Shriver.

508
00:36:16,743 --> 00:36:19,880
But I'm not the Shriver
who wrote the book.

509
00:36:20,414 --> 00:36:21,816
I'm not that Shriver.

510
00:36:22,316 --> 00:36:23,451
Of course not.

511
00:36:24,452 --> 00:36:27,721
You're Shriver the shape-shifter
in <i>Goat Time</i>

512
00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:31,959
who weaves a cocoon
around himself
and then emerges...

513
00:36:32,093 --> 00:36:33,626
I'm not that Shriver.
...unchanged.

514
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,429
You're reenacting
the non-reinvention...

515
00:36:35,562 --> 00:36:37,731
I'm not Shriver!
...of your protagonist!

516
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:39,367
I'm not Shriver!

517
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:43,237
Come on. Hey.
All right. Fine. Go.

518
00:36:43,371 --> 00:36:46,440
But I'm gonna
tell you something,
this goes up tonight.

519
00:36:47,274 --> 00:36:49,443
Up? What--
What goes up?
This story.

520
00:36:49,576 --> 00:36:51,145
But I haven't told you anything.

521
00:36:51,278 --> 00:36:54,647
You don't know the beauty
of Internet journalism.

522
00:36:54,781 --> 00:36:57,952
Absolutely nothing
is more than enough.

523
00:36:58,085 --> 00:37:01,155
And I just had drinks
with Shriver.

524
00:37:01,288 --> 00:37:02,423
That's the story.

525
00:37:02,555 --> 00:37:05,026
Everything else is just filler.

526
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:06,626
But you didn't.

527
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,129
I didn't what?

528
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,730
Have drinks with Shriver.

529
00:37:10,865 --> 00:37:12,565
Don't fuck with me, Shriver.

530
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:49,602
All right.

531
00:37:54,341 --> 00:37:55,342
All right.

532
00:37:55,876 --> 00:37:57,278
I got it. I got it.

533
00:37:57,411 --> 00:38:00,314
What, are you following me?
And you can keep the change.

534
00:38:11,492 --> 00:38:14,694
Uh, may I present
Victor Shastri Bennet,
the playwright.

535
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:17,630
Ah, no need for formalities.
Call me VSB, please.

536
00:38:17,764 --> 00:38:20,234
We're discussing Fugard, Soyinka

537
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:23,537
and intertextuality
as it relates to my work.

538
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,239
Oh, please.

539
00:38:26,073 --> 00:38:26,807
Continue.

540
00:38:26,941 --> 00:38:29,110
This man needs a whiskey.

541
00:38:30,311 --> 00:38:33,981
- Can I get a-- a kangaroo?
- Excuse me?

542
00:38:34,747 --> 00:38:36,350
The bartender will know.

543
00:38:36,484 --> 00:38:38,886
I don't know
if you've officially met
Blythe Brown,

544
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:41,489
and this is
her companion, Layla.

545
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,959
So, Shriver, tell me,
are you a big fan
of the theater?

546
00:38:45,092 --> 00:38:47,261
Have you seen anything
worth writing home about lately?

547
00:38:47,394 --> 00:38:50,931
Mmm.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, a lot.
I've seen a lot.

548
00:38:51,065 --> 00:38:52,967
- What's that?
- Like what?

549
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:56,837
Yeah, I--
I've seen some things.

550
00:38:56,971 --> 00:38:59,173
All right.
Anything of late, you know?

551
00:39:00,374 --> 00:39:04,912
Any works that you've
sort of been taken by?
Tell me.

552
00:39:05,678 --> 00:39:09,083
Uh, yes. So, uh...

553
00:39:09,216 --> 00:39:10,251
Oh, here it is.

554
00:39:11,285 --> 00:39:13,786
So, what do you do, Ms. Layla?

555
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:16,457
I'm a sculptor.

556
00:39:17,057 --> 00:39:18,758
And what is your medium?

557
00:39:18,893 --> 00:39:20,060
Pipe cleaners?

558
00:39:20,194 --> 00:39:21,629
Play-Doh?

559
00:39:21,761 --> 00:39:23,397
Uh, cake.

560
00:39:23,531 --> 00:39:24,697
Did you say cake?
Mm-hmm.

561
00:39:24,832 --> 00:39:27,635
Cake.
Sometimes we eat them.

562
00:39:27,767 --> 00:39:30,137
She said cake,
Shriver. Did you hear?

563
00:39:30,271 --> 00:39:31,138
Yeah.

564
00:39:31,272 --> 00:39:33,140
Yeah.
That's odd.

565
00:39:35,342 --> 00:39:36,377
Odd?

566
00:39:37,511 --> 00:39:39,613
No, that's not-- Oh, shit.

567
00:39:39,746 --> 00:39:41,248
That came out wrong. Uh--

568
00:39:41,382 --> 00:39:43,184
Uh, no offense.

569
00:39:43,317 --> 00:39:45,553
I don't know what
I find more offensive,

570
00:39:45,685 --> 00:39:50,090
your insistence on seeing
the world through the prism
of the sexist patriarchy

571
00:39:50,224 --> 00:39:57,298
or your belligerent refusal
to take seriously the work
of committed women artists.

572
00:40:00,034 --> 00:40:03,003
Yeah, I suppose
you could find them
equally offensive.

573
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:05,306
Yeah.

574
00:40:08,442 --> 00:40:09,709
Cheers!

575
00:40:09,843 --> 00:40:13,247
Cheers!

Yeah. Fine.

581
00:40:32,132 --> 00:40:33,701
Uh--

582
00:40:33,834 --> 00:40:39,006
Do you happen to recall
when exactly, uh, this agent
is arriving? My agent?

583
00:40:39,139 --> 00:40:39,974
Oh.

584
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:42,276
He didn't specify.

585
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:45,012
Okay.
He made his own
arrangements.

586
00:40:46,714 --> 00:40:48,048
Oh, shit.

587
00:40:48,182 --> 00:40:49,316
Time.

588
00:40:49,817 --> 00:40:51,151
Back to campus

589
00:40:51,285 --> 00:40:54,588
for a play
from our very own
Victor Bennet.

590
00:40:54,722 --> 00:40:56,190
Ah...

591
00:40:56,323 --> 00:40:57,057
Really?

592
00:40:57,191 --> 00:40:59,827
Hold up.

593
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:23,417
Are you sure this is okay?

594
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:28,389
As long as Simone--
Professor Cleary
doesn't catch us.

595
00:41:28,522 --> 00:41:30,991
Yeah, I don't want
to make her angry.

596
00:41:36,196 --> 00:41:38,798
You're sweet on her,
aren't you, Shriver?

597
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,834
No.

598
00:41:42,603 --> 00:41:43,937
Be gentle with her.

599
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:46,173
She's been hurt.

600
00:41:47,107 --> 00:41:49,510
Betrayed by the man she loved.

601
00:41:50,577 --> 00:41:52,046
Some years ago...

602
00:41:53,847 --> 00:41:55,816
fresh off of her wounds,

603
00:41:55,949 --> 00:41:58,285
Simone fell for a...

604
00:41:59,787 --> 00:42:02,056
decidedly third-rate poet.

605
00:42:07,995 --> 00:42:09,863
A traveler came by

606
00:42:11,432 --> 00:42:13,033
and silently,

607
00:42:13,867 --> 00:42:15,336
invisibly...

608
00:42:17,738 --> 00:42:19,473
took her with a sigh.

609
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:27,614
He was maddeningly handsome,
though.

610
00:42:35,122 --> 00:42:37,624
You better, uh,
get on up there.

611
00:42:37,758 --> 00:42:39,259
They'll miss you.

612
00:42:42,396 --> 00:42:43,497
All right.

613
00:42:53,207 --> 00:42:55,442
It's an hour of my life
I'm never gonna get back.

614
00:42:55,576 --> 00:42:57,211
Yeah. Yeah.

615
00:42:57,344 --> 00:43:01,014
Oh! Shriver! So, tell me,
what did you think?

616
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,518
Uh--

617
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:07,087
I'm sorry, I missed it.

618
00:43:09,022 --> 00:43:13,460
But perhaps
you would do me the honor
of allowing me to read it?

619
00:43:14,762 --> 00:43:16,196
Thank you.

620
00:43:17,398 --> 00:43:19,433
That-- That would mean
a lot to me, actually.

621
00:43:19,566 --> 00:43:20,934
My pleasure.

622
00:43:21,068 --> 00:43:23,737
Well, my public awaits.

623
00:43:23,872 --> 00:43:24,873
Yes.

624
00:43:25,005 --> 00:43:26,173
I'll see you later.
Bye now.

625
00:43:26,306 --> 00:43:28,609
Congratulations.
Thank you. Appreciate you.

626
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:49,196
Thank you

627
00:43:49,831 --> 00:43:51,265
for Victor Bennet.

628
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,270
I hope you know how much
it means to the university
that you're here.

629
00:43:57,738 --> 00:43:59,072
And to me.

630
00:44:02,276 --> 00:44:08,148
For years, I've been torn
between fighting to make this
a better place

631
00:44:08,282 --> 00:44:13,353
or just to putting 100%
of my energies into making it
as a writer, finally.

632
00:44:14,388 --> 00:44:18,158
Either way, I'm just
tilting at windmills,
you know?

633
00:44:19,793 --> 00:44:22,696
Well, it's better
than running into 'em.

634
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,248
Oh, Mr. Shriver.

635
00:45:01,268 --> 00:45:02,937
Jacuzzi time.
Yeah.

636
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,806
What?
Just text him.

637
00:45:04,939 --> 00:45:06,173
No.

638
00:45:11,211 --> 00:45:13,247
I've got your number, buddy.

639
00:45:14,014 --> 00:45:15,315
Why?

640
00:45:15,449 --> 00:45:17,618
Something about you
just doesn't smell right.

641
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,209
Well, you conned your way
through day one.

642
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:45,612
But it's gonna get
more difficult after this.

643
00:45:46,547 --> 00:45:48,081
I don't know what to do.

644
00:45:48,215 --> 00:45:51,819
I'd keep an eye
on that cake lady.
She could be trouble.

645
00:45:51,953 --> 00:45:53,120
And her girlfriend poet.

646
00:45:53,922 --> 00:45:56,557
Well, she hates my book,
that's for sure.

647
00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:00,360
Your book? Listen to you,
starting to believe
your own bullshit.

648
00:46:00,494 --> 00:46:03,397
You can lie to them,
but not me.

649
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,835
Open up. Police.

650
00:46:09,736 --> 00:46:10,805
What?

651
00:46:12,807 --> 00:46:14,408
What's the problem?

652
00:46:22,316 --> 00:46:25,452
There's no sleeping, Shriver.

653
00:46:27,321 --> 00:46:29,958
- Okay.
-  Let's have one of those cups, thank you.

654
00:46:30,123 --> 00:46:31,692
Are you avoiding me?

655
00:46:31,826 --> 00:46:32,860
Yes.

656
00:46:32,994 --> 00:46:34,595
Can't say I blame you.

657
00:46:35,228 --> 00:46:36,730
Where's Layla?

658
00:46:36,864 --> 00:46:39,666
In our room,
sulking as per usual.
You spilled a lot of it.

659
00:46:40,334 --> 00:46:41,468
Cheers.

660
00:46:41,602 --> 00:46:43,370
How dare you?

661
00:46:43,503 --> 00:46:45,940
Have a party
and not even invite me, Shriver.

662
00:46:46,074 --> 00:46:47,140
Come on!

663
00:46:47,274 --> 00:46:48,542
You're rude.

664
00:46:48,675 --> 00:46:51,578
Ah, hey, now.
Have a look at that.

665
00:46:53,915 --> 00:46:56,450
Whoo! Party!
Whoo.

666
00:46:58,785 --> 00:46:59,921
Come down!

667
00:47:01,055 --> 00:47:05,592
I believe that we would be fools
to pass up such an invitation.

668
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:07,594
I'm kind of tired.

669
00:47:07,996 --> 00:47:08,963
Shriver.

670
00:47:09,097 --> 00:47:11,398
Where's that bon vivant esprit

671
00:47:11,531 --> 00:47:14,501
that I would expect from the man
that wrote <i>Goat Time?</i>

672
00:47:14,635 --> 00:47:16,070
T., it's disgusting.

673
00:47:16,203 --> 00:47:17,471
You're too old and decrepit

674
00:47:17,604 --> 00:47:20,474
to be talking about that.
Bite thy tongue, lass.

675
00:47:21,675 --> 00:47:24,979
I may be old,
but I have poetry on my side.

676
00:47:25,113 --> 00:47:26,780
I'm in.

677
00:47:28,315 --> 00:47:30,183
I'm gonna call it a night.

678
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:35,522
I'm very disappointed
in you, Shriver.

679
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:40,460
Come on, Teresa.
O-- Okay.

680
00:47:40,594 --> 00:47:43,330
I guess my work here is done.

681
00:47:43,463 --> 00:47:45,332
I'll see you in the morning.

682
00:47:45,867 --> 00:47:47,234
Where is everyone going?

683
00:47:49,302 --> 00:47:52,339
Well, that broke up fast. Yeah?

684
00:47:52,472 --> 00:47:54,942
So, you know what? All good.

685
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:57,611
You know where to find me.

686
00:48:47,929 --> 00:48:51,465
<i>All night long I lay there,</i>
<i>wide awake,</i>

687
00:48:51,598 --> 00:48:53,201
<i>wondering what the watermark</i>
<i>would look like</i>

688
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:56,503
<i>when daylight</i>
<i>started creeping in</i>
<i>the next morning.</i>

689
00:48:56,636 --> 00:48:59,006
<i>Good night, Mr. Bojangles.</i>

690
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:02,910
<i>As dawn broke,</i>
<i>I saw the spot had grown</i>
<i>even more...</i>

691
00:49:03,044 --> 00:49:05,813
<i>Good night, Mr. Bojangles.</i>

692
00:49:05,947 --> 00:49:10,118
<i>...now to the general size</i>
<i>and shape of an adult person.</i>

693
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:11,919
<i>Good night, Mr. Bojangles.</i>

694
00:49:12,053 --> 00:49:15,589
<i>A woman with long flowing hair.</i>

695
00:49:15,722 --> 00:49:17,892
<i>Good night, Mr. Bojangles.</i>

696
00:49:28,903 --> 00:49:29,937
Wha--

697
00:49:33,875 --> 00:49:35,442
Hello.

698
00:49:35,575 --> 00:49:37,845
Hi. It's Teresa.
I'm in the lobby.

699
00:49:38,212 --> 00:49:39,881
Who? What?

700
00:49:40,014 --> 00:49:42,817
You're talking to
my creative writing workshop
this morning.

701
00:49:44,252 --> 00:49:47,420
Mmm. No, that's a mistake.

702
00:49:47,554 --> 00:49:49,456
No, it's not a mistake.
It's in the program.

703
00:49:49,589 --> 00:49:51,358
<i>Didn't you get a program?</i>

704
00:49:52,226 --> 00:49:54,128
Uh, no, I never got a program.

705
00:49:55,163 --> 00:49:58,032
<i>Okay. Well, um,</i>
<i>class starts in 20 minutes.</i>

706
00:50:06,007 --> 00:50:07,942
You guys grab breakfast?
Oh, crap.

707
00:50:11,913 --> 00:50:13,281
Never stop planning.

708
00:50:13,413 --> 00:50:15,515
You're overthinking it.

709
00:50:18,986 --> 00:50:21,388
She was at the bar,
and then she would've
come back upstairs.

710
00:50:21,521 --> 00:50:24,025
So, if you were here last night,
I'm asking if you saw anything?

711
00:50:24,158 --> 00:50:25,259
I don't know.
Excuse me.

712
00:50:25,392 --> 00:50:26,793
Shriver!
Oh, Shriver, we gotta go.

713
00:50:26,928 --> 00:50:29,596
Good morning, Shriver.
Uh, I locked my key in my room.

714
00:50:29,729 --> 00:50:31,032
Blythe never came back
last night.

715
00:50:31,165 --> 00:50:33,034
You know that?
She's gone. She just vanished.

716
00:50:33,167 --> 00:50:35,468
We have to go.
The class is waiting.
That's unfortunate.

717
00:50:35,602 --> 00:50:38,139
- Maybe she just went for a walk.
- Just a walk?

718
00:50:38,272 --> 00:50:44,212
Where would she have walked to?
Well, a walk doesn't imply
some specific destination.

719
00:50:44,344 --> 00:50:47,781
"I am he that walks with
the tender and growing night."

720
00:50:47,915 --> 00:50:48,850
Whitman.

721
00:50:49,783 --> 00:50:51,518
Okay. We have to go.
Oh, my God.

722
00:50:51,651 --> 00:50:53,955
Wasn't she
in your room last night?

723
00:50:56,023 --> 00:50:57,325
Yeah, but she left.

724
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:58,826
What time was that?

725
00:50:59,759 --> 00:51:01,461
I have no idea.
How do you not know?

726
00:51:01,595 --> 00:51:03,965
The man doesn't know.
He has more important things
to think about.

727
00:51:04,098 --> 00:51:05,699
You don't know?
I'm gonna call the police!

728
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:08,435
We have to go.
That's not good.

729
00:51:08,568 --> 00:51:10,637
What do they expect from me?
Your students.

730
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:12,572
Um, like, nothing.
I told them you're a genius.

731
00:51:12,706 --> 00:51:14,374
Whatever you say,
they're gonna eat it up.

732
00:51:14,507 --> 00:51:17,677
I had them read the book.
I think some of them
actually did read it.

733
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:22,616
Also, they all want to be
writers and none of them
like to read.

734
00:51:42,303 --> 00:51:44,038
Why is your book
so misogynistic?

735
00:51:44,171 --> 00:51:45,306
I think it's erotic.

736
00:51:45,438 --> 00:51:47,308
It's just dirty.

737
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,676
So? Life is dirty.

738
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:52,346
And I wanna ask,
why did you choose

739
00:51:52,479 --> 00:51:56,416
to name your main character
after yourself?

740
00:51:56,549 --> 00:52:00,587
Uh, I couldn't think of
another name
and mine was handy.

741
00:52:01,255 --> 00:52:02,622
Well, what happened to the wife?

742
00:52:02,756 --> 00:52:04,258
How can she disappear like that?

743
00:52:04,392 --> 00:52:06,093
Well, he killed her, right?

744
00:52:06,626 --> 00:52:08,662
Nah, he didn't kill her.

745
00:52:08,795 --> 00:52:10,463
What's true?

746
00:52:13,067 --> 00:52:16,503
What do you use
from your imagination
and what comes from your life?

747
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:25,379
Well, to be honest, uh,

748
00:52:25,512 --> 00:52:29,749
I have trouble telling
the difference between
reality and imagination.

749
00:52:34,221 --> 00:52:40,027
But how do you understand
your experience
without imagination?

750
00:52:41,795 --> 00:52:44,865
Fiction or stories,

751
00:52:44,999 --> 00:52:48,936
it's a tool that humans have
that no other creatures has

752
00:52:49,736 --> 00:52:52,472
to make sense of our existence.

753
00:52:53,707 --> 00:52:56,210
We create a fictional world...

754
00:52:58,145 --> 00:53:03,050
as a laboratory to make sense
of the actual world.

755
00:53:39,619 --> 00:53:40,921
Thanks.

756
00:53:59,606 --> 00:54:03,244
<i>I'm excited for the students</i>
<i>to meet, like, a real writer.</i>

757
00:54:03,377 --> 00:54:05,712
<i>Well, aren't there plenty</i>
<i>of real writers here?</i>

758
00:54:05,846 --> 00:54:07,281
<i>T., Simone.</i>

759
00:54:09,283 --> 00:54:11,419
It's like the only place
you can find their books

760
00:54:11,551 --> 00:54:15,655
is in the college bookstore
in the local author section.

761
00:54:18,591 --> 00:54:20,928
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>Simone had published a book.</i>

762
00:54:22,863 --> 00:54:24,999
<i>She actually published two.</i>

763
00:54:26,233 --> 00:54:28,836
<i>And the thing is,</i>
<i>she's not a bad writer.</i>

764
00:54:29,636 --> 00:54:31,172
She's actually pretty good.

765
00:54:32,173 --> 00:54:34,408
<i>She's just kind of like</i>
<i>a cautionary tale.</i>

766
00:54:34,542 --> 00:54:36,444
<i>What? How's that?</i>

767
00:54:36,576 --> 00:54:39,213
Because, like, when I'm her age,
I want to be in Brooklyn

768
00:54:39,346 --> 00:54:41,614
with a writing career
and an editor and an agent.

769
00:54:41,748 --> 00:54:43,951
I don't want to be
in fucking Acheron.

770
00:55:09,043 --> 00:55:10,978
Oh, there you are.
Come on, we gotta go.

771
00:55:11,112 --> 00:55:13,414
What?
We're really late.
We gotta go.

772
00:55:13,547 --> 00:55:15,282
Can I--
Can I take these?

773
00:55:15,416 --> 00:55:18,385
What? Uh, yeah.
Would you put these
on my account?

774
00:55:19,353 --> 00:55:20,588
Thank you so much.

775
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,956
I got it.

776
00:55:39,672 --> 00:55:44,411
Oh, you missed
one hell of a party
last night, Shriver.

777
00:55:44,545 --> 00:55:46,347
Beyond the beyond.

778
00:55:47,214 --> 00:55:51,619
But what happens at Hotel 99
stays in Hotel 99.

779
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:56,891
But I'm gonna write
a best-selling book about
that place one of these days.

780
00:55:57,024 --> 00:55:59,994
I was hoping to have you
in one of the chapters.

781
00:56:00,961 --> 00:56:03,796
Didn't you just say
what happens there stays there?

782
00:56:05,566 --> 00:56:07,234
- Well...
- Hi, guys.

783
00:56:07,868 --> 00:56:09,270
Hey, Victor.

784
00:56:09,403 --> 00:56:14,608
I see our, uh,
favorite sapphic
poet is MIA.

785
00:56:14,741 --> 00:56:16,844
I heard the authorities
have been alerted.

786
00:56:16,977 --> 00:56:19,246
Authorities? What authorities?

787
00:56:21,681 --> 00:56:23,617
You seem a little worried,
Shriver.

788
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:25,519
Something you need to tell me?

789
00:56:28,755 --> 00:56:30,124
You read those?

790
00:56:30,257 --> 00:56:33,427
Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm. Sure.
Very nice. They're, um...

791
00:56:34,962 --> 00:56:36,263
...domestic dramas.

792
00:56:36,397 --> 00:56:39,466
You know,
women struggling
to find their place.

793
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,935
You seem dismissive.

794
00:56:41,068 --> 00:56:42,903
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

795
00:56:43,037 --> 00:56:45,206
It's just that--
Well, I mean,

796
00:56:45,973 --> 00:56:48,275
writers like you and me,

797
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:50,477
I mean,

798
00:56:50,611 --> 00:56:52,846
we're going for
the big fish, aren't we?

799
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:57,451
Dredging the truths
from the murky depths.

800
00:56:58,185 --> 00:57:00,054
Well...

801
00:57:02,323 --> 00:57:03,857
Hello. Welcome.

802
00:57:03,991 --> 00:57:07,428
I know that, uh,
we're all happy to be here.

803
00:57:07,561 --> 00:57:09,129
I certainly am.

804
00:57:09,263 --> 00:57:12,833
I'm going to start
by introducing the gentleman
on my right,

805
00:57:12,967 --> 00:57:16,904
who would need no introduction
if his face was
a little more familiar.

806
00:57:18,405 --> 00:57:20,808
He's the author of
but one novel--

807
00:57:20,941 --> 00:57:23,677
one great novel.

808
00:57:23,811 --> 00:57:25,579
Ladies and gentlemen, Shriver.

809
00:57:31,252 --> 00:57:34,521
And next, I'd like to introduce
our playwright, Victor Bennet,

810
00:57:34,655 --> 00:57:37,358
who comes to us
from somewhere across the ocean.

811
00:57:37,491 --> 00:57:41,328
We all had the pleasure
of enjoying
his hysterically funny

812
00:57:41,462 --> 00:57:46,367
and yet deeply emotional
two-hander last night,
right here.

813
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:47,434
Victor Bennet.

814
00:57:48,902 --> 00:57:53,040
The theme for our
panel discussion today is,

815
00:57:53,173 --> 00:57:56,810
are the words
on the page reality

816
00:57:57,777 --> 00:57:59,113
or illusion?

817
00:58:00,981 --> 00:58:02,516
Gentlemen?

818
00:58:04,784 --> 00:58:08,122
Is not reality
an illusion anyway?

819
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:10,524
- Here comes the bullshit.
- Reality/illusion.

820
00:58:10,658 --> 00:58:13,761
That slash implies
something synonymic,
does it not?

821
00:58:13,894 --> 00:58:17,931
If I wrote fiction
like my colleagues, I would
be a playwright/novelist.

822
00:58:18,065 --> 00:58:21,769
Nobody would argue with that.
Obstetrician/gynecologist.

823
00:58:21,902 --> 00:58:24,471
AC/DC.

824
00:58:24,605 --> 00:58:25,906
Yeah!

825
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,341
I see you've been jotting down

826
00:58:27,474 --> 00:58:29,877
some of your thoughts there
on your pad, Shriver.

827
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:33,514
Would you care to enlighten us?

828
00:58:43,457 --> 00:58:46,126
So, last night,
from my hotel room,

829
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:50,597
I saw this, um,
group of cheerleaders,

830
00:58:50,731 --> 00:58:55,035
young women
dancing and frolicking

831
00:58:55,169 --> 00:58:57,806
like children by a pool.

832
00:58:58,972 --> 00:59:05,412
And then one of these
young women
floated up through the air,

833
00:59:07,047 --> 00:59:10,384
gently,
like a feather
blown by the breeze.

834
00:59:12,152 --> 00:59:15,222
She had long blond hair
and blue eyes.

835
00:59:16,223 --> 00:59:18,992
And from my window,
I could have reached out

836
00:59:20,027 --> 00:59:22,129
and touched her face.

837
00:59:24,998 --> 00:59:27,735
And beyond
this lovely young woman,

838
00:59:29,103 --> 00:59:35,342
I would not have been able to
make out where the high desert
met the night sky,

839
00:59:36,143 --> 00:59:38,479
but for an invisible line...

840
00:59:40,314 --> 00:59:43,717
that stated
where the earth ended

841
00:59:44,318 --> 00:59:46,653
and millions of stars began.

842
00:59:48,422 --> 00:59:50,424
And as all of this was happening

843
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:54,428
this long,
slow freight train rolled by...

844
00:59:56,697 --> 01:00:02,403
its wheels making that clacking
noise that's so reassuring.

845
01:00:04,538 --> 01:00:09,009
Right in time as it is
with our own heartbeat.

846
01:00:15,582 --> 01:00:18,118
Or maybe I made it all up.

847
01:00:23,223 --> 01:00:26,360
- Well done. Well done.
- Brilliant.

848
01:00:37,004 --> 01:00:40,040
Hey! Just the man
I was looking for.

849
01:00:40,174 --> 01:00:41,408
Check this out.

850
01:00:41,542 --> 01:00:45,779
Over 100,000 hits,
600 comments and counting.

851
01:00:45,914 --> 01:00:48,917
I need to
go to the bathroom.
This lady from Toledo...

852
01:00:49,049 --> 01:00:50,117
Mr. Shriver,

853
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:51,552
I'm Detective Karpas.

854
01:00:52,619 --> 01:00:55,522
Are you in some kind
of trouble, Shriver?

855
01:00:55,656 --> 01:00:56,825
I don't know.

856
01:00:56,957 --> 01:00:58,192
Please.

857
01:01:02,129 --> 01:01:04,331
I'm reading your book,
Mr. Shriver.

858
01:01:04,465 --> 01:01:06,667
You have an interesting
perspective on life.

859
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,402
Do I?
Yeah.

860
01:01:08,535 --> 01:01:11,071
I'd describe it as nihilistic.
Wouldn't you?

861
01:01:12,105 --> 01:01:14,608
Yeah,
I'm not fond of labels.
Mm-hmm.

862
01:01:14,741 --> 01:01:15,877
Is that a Cuban?

863
01:01:16,009 --> 01:01:17,578
Oh. Sure is.

864
01:01:18,612 --> 01:01:21,215
You know, your characters,
they have no morals, right?

865
01:01:21,348 --> 01:01:24,785
There's no goods, no evils.
There's no God.

866
01:01:24,919 --> 01:01:27,087
Just debauchery and filth

867
01:01:27,221 --> 01:01:28,789
and--
and rampant infidelity.

868
01:01:28,923 --> 01:01:32,059
And, uh, well,
murder, of course.

869
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,829
Yeah.
Yeah.

870
01:01:34,963 --> 01:01:38,532
I hear you're the last person
to see Ms. Brown alive.

871
01:01:39,233 --> 01:01:40,501
Wait, she's dead?

872
01:01:40,634 --> 01:01:42,904
Oh, no,
I didn't say she was dead.

873
01:01:43,036 --> 01:01:44,873
Why? Is there something
you wanna tell me?

874
01:01:45,005 --> 01:01:47,441
Is she dead?
No. No, she's missing.

875
01:01:47,574 --> 01:01:51,478
But, uh, you know,
after 24 hours, these things
rarely turn out well.

876
01:01:52,546 --> 01:01:55,282
The night girl at the hotel says

877
01:01:55,415 --> 01:01:58,652
Ms. Brown left you a little note
earlier in the evening.

878
01:02:00,354 --> 01:02:03,290
Yeah, she wanted to meet me
for a drink at the bar.

879
01:02:04,024 --> 01:02:05,392
That is interesting.

880
01:02:05,526 --> 01:02:06,995
Just 'cause I have, uh,

881
01:02:07,127 --> 01:02:10,797
yeah, 400 people
who witnessed you guys
arguing that night.

882
01:02:13,133 --> 01:02:15,102
So, did you join her at the bar?

883
01:02:15,235 --> 01:02:16,770
No, I was tired.

884
01:02:16,905 --> 01:02:19,206
Mm-hmm. Not too tired
to throw a shindig
in your room, right?

885
01:02:19,339 --> 01:02:22,376
Shriver,
do you need a lawyer?
I don't think so.

886
01:02:25,045 --> 01:02:26,246
Okay.
Okay.

887
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:29,516
See you at the soiree.
What soiree?

888
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:31,685
Oh...

889
01:02:31,819 --> 01:02:32,854
He's fun.

890
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,622
Listen, I--
I've been digging up your past,

891
01:02:35,756 --> 01:02:39,726
and it's just some stuff
doesn't exactly add up.

892
01:02:39,861 --> 01:02:42,563
Wouldn't happen to know
where your ex-wife is,
would you?

893
01:02:44,698 --> 01:02:47,434
No.
Okay.

894
01:02:47,568 --> 01:02:50,070
Hey, I'll let you know
if I find anything, huh?

895
01:02:53,841 --> 01:02:55,175
Fuck.

896
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:57,077
Oh, boy.

897
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:58,245
Fuck.

898
01:02:58,378 --> 01:02:59,713
He thinks you killed her.

899
01:02:59,847 --> 01:03:00,949
Killed who?

900
01:03:01,081 --> 01:03:03,617
The poet, of course.

901
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:05,352
Maybe your wife too.

902
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,021
I-- I didn't.

903
01:03:07,154 --> 01:03:09,023
You know,
it's, uh, interesting,

904
01:03:09,156 --> 01:03:11,558
the parallels between your life

905
01:03:11,692 --> 01:03:14,695
and the protagonist
in Shriver's book.

906
01:03:14,829 --> 01:03:15,796
Don't you think?

907
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:17,397
Yeah, all right.

908
01:03:17,531 --> 01:03:20,334
Just leave me alone
so I can think,
all right?

909
01:03:20,734 --> 01:03:22,169
Shriver.

910
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:24,771
Oh, sorry.
Come on.

911
01:03:24,906 --> 01:03:28,208
So, I'm gonna run some errands,
and then we'll stop by
my house and change.

912
01:03:33,513 --> 01:03:35,115
How about me?
I look like a bum.

913
01:03:35,248 --> 01:03:39,386
Oh, you're the writer.
You're allowed to be
who you are.

914
01:03:40,187 --> 01:03:42,322
And what about you?
You're a writer too.

915
01:03:43,423 --> 01:03:45,860
People don't see me that way
around here.

916
01:03:50,098 --> 01:03:51,431
I hate this party.

917
01:03:51,565 --> 01:03:53,067
I wish we could just skip it.

918
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,135
Let's skip it.
No, we can't.

919
01:03:55,268 --> 01:03:56,737
Why not?
Because.

920
01:03:56,871 --> 01:03:59,539
Dr. Bedrosian's
the key benefactor
for the festival.

921
01:03:59,673 --> 01:04:02,010
This is the night
that we go to her house,

922
01:04:02,142 --> 01:04:05,512
we make her feel very important.

923
01:04:08,348 --> 01:04:09,683
More precisely,

924
01:04:09,817 --> 01:04:14,655
you are going
to make her feel
really important.

925
01:04:15,489 --> 01:04:17,892
It's called singing
for your supper.

926
01:04:18,725 --> 01:04:20,260
I see.

927
01:04:20,394 --> 01:04:23,430
I mean, to be clear,
you don't have to sing

928
01:04:23,563 --> 01:04:27,935
every tune
Dr. Bedrosian asks you to sing.

929
01:04:28,069 --> 01:04:29,202
You know what I mean.

930
01:04:29,336 --> 01:04:31,939
What does Dr. Bedrosian teach?

931
01:04:32,073 --> 01:04:34,042
Oh, she's not at the university.

932
01:04:34,174 --> 01:04:36,643
She's a local gynecologist.

933
01:04:37,145 --> 01:04:38,245
Huh.

934
01:04:44,551 --> 01:04:48,188
You did not buy those.

935
01:04:49,523 --> 01:04:51,258
I wanna get you
to sign 'em for me.

936
01:04:51,391 --> 01:04:54,929
I could have given you a copy.
I have boxes of them.

937
01:04:55,063 --> 01:04:56,630
- Really?
- Yeah.

938
01:04:56,763 --> 01:04:58,532
Your books,
they should be out in the world,

939
01:04:58,665 --> 01:05:00,968
because what I've read
so far is, uh--

940
01:05:02,302 --> 01:05:04,504
it's truly extraordinary.

941
01:05:05,139 --> 01:05:06,773
I had lots of dreams.

942
01:05:08,442 --> 01:05:11,278
But then I, you know,

943
01:05:11,979 --> 01:05:13,815
had to deal with reality.

944
01:05:15,415 --> 01:05:17,018
People try to give me advice:

945
01:05:17,151 --> 01:05:19,653
get online, get a website,

946
01:05:20,287 --> 01:05:21,788
build a platform.

947
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:25,193
They say it's more important
than the actual writing.

948
01:05:25,358 --> 01:05:27,128
How cynical is that?

949
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:30,330
You know, then there's... you.

950
01:05:30,464 --> 01:05:32,332
You're nowhere to be found.

951
01:05:32,466 --> 01:05:36,003
You practically deny
that you're the author
of your own book.

952
01:05:36,137 --> 01:05:40,108
You play little mind games
every time someone asks you
a straight question.

953
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:45,545
And you, more than anyone,
have let your work
speak for itself.

954
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:50,717
I let my work speak for itself
and no one listens.

955
01:05:54,055 --> 01:05:56,690
I, uh, should finish.
We're gonna be late.

956
01:06:01,229 --> 01:06:02,662
I'll make you a deal.

957
01:06:03,898 --> 01:06:07,634
You read me some of <i>Goat Time</i> --
my own private reading,

958
01:06:07,768 --> 01:06:10,737
and I'll sign your books.

959
01:06:13,707 --> 01:06:14,775
Hmm.

960
01:06:17,477 --> 01:06:19,446
Well,
what do you want me to read?

961
01:06:19,579 --> 01:06:21,681
Just any of the pages
that I dog-eared.

962
01:06:21,816 --> 01:06:22,917
Out loud?

963
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:24,886
No, silently.

964
01:06:25,019 --> 01:06:26,553
Yes, out loud.

965
01:06:41,768 --> 01:06:43,670
"In the days, then weeks,

966
01:06:43,805 --> 01:06:47,074
then months
following my wife's departure,

967
01:06:48,542 --> 01:06:50,978
I kept expecting
to feel something.

968
01:06:53,147 --> 01:06:54,481
Yet I felt nothing.

969
01:06:54,614 --> 01:06:57,384
No grief, no loss, no sadness.

970
01:06:58,618 --> 01:07:01,454
I experienced only weariness

971
01:07:01,588 --> 01:07:07,394
as if I were hoisting
a heavy bucket
from a well of infinite depth.

972
01:07:09,696 --> 01:07:13,034
Then one day,
as I was taking the bus,

973
01:07:13,167 --> 01:07:17,205
heading downtown
to meet Franz for lunch,
I saw a man.

974
01:07:18,306 --> 01:07:22,944
He was about my age, my height,
wearing a long tweed overcoat

975
01:07:23,945 --> 01:07:26,613
exactly like the one

976
01:07:26,746 --> 01:07:30,350
I had left behind
at a rail station
many years ago.

977
01:07:32,552 --> 01:07:35,522
That long-ago day had begun
with a wintry chill

978
01:07:35,655 --> 01:07:40,261
that blossomed into warmth
as the noon hour approached.

979
01:07:40,393 --> 01:07:44,065
I removed the coat
and folded it
on the bench beside me.

980
01:07:44,866 --> 01:07:48,702
Then I dozed, dreaming, I think,

981
01:07:48,836 --> 01:07:51,806
and woke to the final call
for my train.

982
01:07:51,939 --> 01:07:54,641
I stood and ran,
leaving the coat behind.

983
01:07:54,774 --> 01:07:59,779
It was over a year,
the following winter, before
I realized it was missing.

984
01:08:01,448 --> 01:08:04,318
The more I examined
the man's coat,

985
01:08:05,253 --> 01:08:08,890
the more convinced I became
that it had been mine.

986
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:12,827
Why was he wearing it?
It was April.

987
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,729
I, myself, was wearing
only a light jacket.

988
01:08:17,031 --> 01:08:20,400
When the bus came to my stop,
he got off.

989
01:08:20,533 --> 01:08:22,069
I decided to follow him.

990
01:08:22,203 --> 01:08:26,007
He crossed Seventh Avenue
and began walking
on 21st Street.

991
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:29,643
He stopped for a moment
at a newsstand

992
01:08:29,776 --> 01:08:32,479
and read the headlines
on some of the tabloids.

993
01:08:32,612 --> 01:08:34,115
He checked his watch.

994
01:08:34,248 --> 01:08:35,649
I checked mine.

995
01:08:35,782 --> 01:08:37,952
I followed the man
for a few hundred feet

996
01:08:38,085 --> 01:08:40,855
and saw him enter
the very same café

997
01:08:40,988 --> 01:08:43,991
where I had arranged
to meet Franz.

998
01:08:44,125 --> 01:08:49,462
I watched him through the window
as he squeezed between
several tables

999
01:08:49,596 --> 01:08:52,133
and then,
to my shock and amazement,

1000
01:08:52,833 --> 01:08:55,435
stopped and greeted Franz.

1001
01:08:56,569 --> 01:08:58,772
The two men hugged,

1002
01:08:58,906 --> 01:09:01,108
and then he sat
across from Franz

1003
01:09:01,242 --> 01:09:04,946
as if he had been the one
with the lunch date.

1004
01:09:05,079 --> 01:09:06,948
I stood watching them
consume their meal.

1005
01:09:07,081 --> 01:09:10,583
The man had an omelet
while Franz chose
the salad Niçoise,

1006
01:09:10,717 --> 01:09:13,586
along with a bottle
of my favorite Sancerre.

1007
01:09:17,058 --> 01:09:20,627
I hated this stranger
out in the world,

1008
01:09:22,163 --> 01:09:23,697
living my life,

1009
01:09:24,764 --> 01:09:27,868
eating my lunch,
breathing my oxygen.

1010
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:35,508
A time would come
when circumstances
would force me to confront him.

1011
01:09:36,743 --> 01:09:39,546
I walked all the way home."

1012
01:09:59,934 --> 01:10:00,968
Mmm.

1013
01:10:04,171 --> 01:10:05,538
Sorry. I just...

1014
01:10:10,311 --> 01:10:11,544
You look nice.

1015
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,682
Nice? That--
That's all you-- you got?

1016
01:10:15,816 --> 01:10:17,550
Oh, no, no.
I meant, uh, great.

1017
01:10:17,684 --> 01:10:21,889
Thank you.
And, you know,
spectacular. Uh, stellar.

1018
01:10:22,023 --> 01:10:22,990
Yeah?

1019
01:10:23,124 --> 01:10:25,658
Do we really have to
go to this party?

1020
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:28,029
Yes.
Okay.

1021
01:10:28,595 --> 01:10:29,830
Oh, my purse.

1022
01:10:34,534 --> 01:10:37,304
Oh, hey. Yeah, you promised.

1023
01:10:37,438 --> 01:10:39,672
You gotta sign the book.

1024
01:10:41,809 --> 01:10:45,813
Um, why don't we do that
after the party?

1025
01:10:47,747 --> 01:10:50,217
Yeah, that's good. Yeah.
Yeah.

1026
01:11:01,829 --> 01:11:02,963
Okay.

1027
01:11:03,097 --> 01:11:05,833
Bourbon, if you don't mind.

1028
01:11:08,668 --> 01:11:10,004
Can we go now?

1029
01:11:10,137 --> 01:11:13,274
Okay, here she comes.
Just humor her.

1030
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:15,675
Hello, Simone.
Hi.

1031
01:11:16,277 --> 01:11:18,711
Ah. Mr. Shriver.

1032
01:11:18,846 --> 01:11:21,315
It's quite an honor
to have you here

1033
01:11:21,449 --> 01:11:23,350
in my not-so-humble abode.

1034
01:11:23,484 --> 01:11:24,819
Thank you.

1035
01:11:24,952 --> 01:11:27,221
I do hope you'll be
comfortable here.

1036
01:11:27,354 --> 01:11:30,757
You know, I try to maintain
a level of urban sophistication

1037
01:11:30,891 --> 01:11:32,759
in this cultural wasteland.

1038
01:11:32,893 --> 01:11:34,462
Yeah, I can see that.

1039
01:11:34,594 --> 01:11:37,764
You know, I just think
it's important to--
to set an example.

1040
01:11:37,898 --> 01:11:41,535
And having you here
is a big part of that.

1041
01:11:41,668 --> 01:11:44,338
It's worth every penny
of my donation.

1042
01:11:44,939 --> 01:11:46,273
Now, you see, I'm...

1043
01:11:46,407 --> 01:11:49,110
...I don't know,
kind of a nut for literature.

1044
01:11:49,709 --> 01:11:50,845
Who's that guy?

1045
01:11:50,978 --> 01:11:53,680
I have no idea.
Come and see my library.

1046
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:05,259
This does not
appear to be a library.

1047
01:12:05,392 --> 01:12:08,195
Yes, but this is
where I do my best work.

1048
01:12:10,264 --> 01:12:11,698
Here it is.

1049
01:12:11,832 --> 01:12:14,301
First edition,
mint condition.

1050
01:12:15,269 --> 01:12:18,572
I don't have to tell you,
I paid a fortune for this.

1051
01:12:18,705 --> 01:12:23,010
Is there anything
that I could do
to get you to sign it for me?

1052
01:12:23,144 --> 01:12:24,677
<i>Are you a writer?</i>

1053
01:12:27,014 --> 01:12:28,582
<i>I know who you are.</i>

1054
01:12:31,852 --> 01:12:33,320
Anything at all?

1055
01:12:35,623 --> 01:12:36,857
A pen.

1056
01:12:37,690 --> 01:12:38,791
Pen.

1057
01:12:38,926 --> 01:12:40,793
I think I need to
go to the bathroom.

1058
01:12:41,595 --> 01:12:42,830
Jesus.

1059
01:12:57,211 --> 01:12:58,745
Hey, hey.

1060
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,483
Shriver residence. Jeeves here.

1061
01:13:02,616 --> 01:13:03,716
<i>Lenny, it's me.</i>

1062
01:13:03,851 --> 01:13:05,519
<i>What's the prize?</i>

1063
01:13:05,653 --> 01:13:07,787
I think I'm Shriver.
<i>Yeah, you're Shriver.</i>
<i>What? So?</i>

1064
01:13:07,922 --> 01:13:11,559
No, the Shriver.
It's nuts, but it all fits.

1065
01:13:11,691 --> 01:13:14,128
I'm remembering his life.
My life.

1066
01:13:14,261 --> 01:13:19,333
I-- What have you been
smoking out there?
I mean, that is crazy.

1067
01:13:20,501 --> 01:13:22,136
Is everything okay in there?

1068
01:13:22,735 --> 01:13:24,438
Yeah, I'm fine.

1069
01:13:25,306 --> 01:13:27,107
<i>What?</i>
It all makes sense now.

1070
01:13:27,241 --> 01:13:29,810
I'm not an impostor.
I wrote <i>Goat Time.</i>

1071
01:13:29,944 --> 01:13:31,645
It's all inside me.

1072
01:13:31,778 --> 01:13:34,982
<i>Forgetting that you</i>
<i>wrote a book</i>
<i>and being a famous person?</i>

1073
01:13:35,115 --> 01:13:37,318
I don't know. Really?

1074
01:13:37,451 --> 01:13:39,853
<i>Writing that book</i>
<i>cost me everything.</i>

1075
01:13:39,987 --> 01:13:41,754
And I--
If I could forget that,

1076
01:13:41,889 --> 01:13:45,960
do you think it's possible
I could forget
committing a murder?

1077
01:13:47,061 --> 01:13:49,930
Uh, you're just
talking hypothetical, right?

1078
01:13:50,064 --> 01:13:53,867
I-- I don't know.
All I know is I'm Shriver.

1079
01:13:54,635 --> 01:13:56,337
And I might be in trouble.

1080
01:13:57,972 --> 01:14:00,541
Okay.
Sure.

1081
01:14:00,674 --> 01:14:03,244
No, I'm Shriver.

1082
01:14:06,413 --> 01:14:08,215
I am the Shriver.

1083
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:12,886
All right, all right.
Take a pill, man.

1084
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:14,521
I'm Shriver!

1085
01:14:15,422 --> 01:14:16,457
Hello?

1086
01:14:17,825 --> 01:14:20,894
Oh, I was beginning
to worry about you.

1087
01:14:22,762 --> 01:14:24,198
Sorry.

1088
01:14:39,747 --> 01:14:42,916
So, uh, what about dinner?

1089
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:45,719
Dinner can wait.
But I'm famished now.

1090
01:14:45,853 --> 01:14:48,188
Oh, please,
talk to me about literature.

1091
01:14:49,323 --> 01:14:51,725
I had this bed
shipped from Positano.

1092
01:14:51,859 --> 01:14:54,728
Oh, she weighs so much,
we had to reinforce
the floor underneath her.

1093
01:14:54,862 --> 01:14:58,332
I want you to read my novel.
It's a guaranteed bestseller.

1094
01:14:58,465 --> 01:15:01,335
Oh, it's got everything.
Violence and sex.

1095
01:15:01,468 --> 01:15:02,403
Yeah.

1096
01:15:02,536 --> 01:15:04,805
It's about
a beautiful gynecologist

1097
01:15:04,938 --> 01:15:06,674
who has a deep, dark secret.

1098
01:15:06,807 --> 01:15:09,143
Yeah, I know. It's about me.

1099
01:15:09,276 --> 01:15:10,978
You know what they say,
"Write what you know."

1100
01:15:11,111 --> 01:15:13,514
I want you to be hard on me,
okay?

1101
01:15:14,448 --> 01:15:17,818
Yes, yes, come on,
you literary lion!
You!

1102
01:15:17,951 --> 01:15:18,986
What?

1103
01:15:19,119 --> 01:15:20,387
Trust me doctor,

1104
01:15:20,521 --> 01:15:24,258
this is one face
not worthy of your wall of fame.

1105
01:15:24,391 --> 01:15:25,726
Simone.

1106
01:15:25,859 --> 01:15:26,727
I gotta go.

1107
01:15:26,894 --> 01:15:29,163
Geez! But--

1108
01:15:30,097 --> 01:15:31,832
You forgot my novel.

1109
01:15:34,668 --> 01:15:37,004
Simone. Simone!

1110
01:15:59,259 --> 01:16:00,994
There has to be something.

1111
01:16:01,128 --> 01:16:03,163
Just like, any room.

1112
01:16:04,598 --> 01:16:06,166
Simone?

1113
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:07,868
Oh.
That's me.

1114
01:16:08,001 --> 01:16:09,470
Who the fuck are you?

1115
01:16:10,337 --> 01:16:12,005
I'm Shriver.
You know,
I've been wondering

1116
01:16:12,139 --> 01:16:14,575
why you've been acting
so evasive since you arrived,

1117
01:16:14,708 --> 01:16:17,077
and someone just showed up
and gave me the answer.

1118
01:16:17,211 --> 01:16:19,780
So, you're not mad
about the gynecologist?

1119
01:16:19,913 --> 01:16:21,014
Oh, please.

1120
01:16:21,148 --> 01:16:23,283
That's a relief.
But, Simone--

1121
01:16:23,417 --> 01:16:26,186
No, no, no, no.
Don't "Simone" me,
whoever you are.

1122
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:31,392
I mean, can you honestly tell me
that you haven't been lying
to me since you got here?

1123
01:16:33,994 --> 01:16:36,330
Well, that's
a complicated question.

1124
01:16:36,463 --> 01:16:38,565
Well, technically,
I've been lying.

1125
01:16:39,868 --> 01:16:42,202
But it turns out
the lies are true.

1126
01:16:43,103 --> 01:16:44,304
Oh, my God.

1127
01:16:44,438 --> 01:16:46,340
This place is disgusting,
Simone.

1128
01:16:46,473 --> 01:16:48,308
There's not even
paper towels in there.

1129
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:49,676
Who is this guy?

1130
01:16:49,811 --> 01:16:50,845
I'm Shriver.

1131
01:16:50,978 --> 01:16:52,546
Oh! There he is.

1132
01:16:52,679 --> 01:16:55,249
The man of the hour.
My doppelgänger.

1133
01:16:55,382 --> 01:16:57,785
You, sir,
have caused me quite a headache.

1134
01:16:57,918 --> 01:16:59,486
I was at a beautiful ashram,

1135
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:04,425
and I was about this close
to achieving
pure bliss and happiness

1136
01:17:04,558 --> 01:17:06,093
when I got a phone call.
Look, buddy,

1137
01:17:06,226 --> 01:17:07,561
I don't know
who you think you are,

1138
01:17:07,694 --> 01:17:08,897
but Mr. Shriver is over here.

1139
01:17:09,029 --> 01:17:10,697
No, he definitely isn't.

1140
01:17:10,832 --> 01:17:13,066
And I think you need to crawl
back to wherever you came from

1141
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:16,403
because you're upsetting this
particularly beautiful lady
right here.

1142
01:17:16,537 --> 01:17:19,173
You stay away from her,
you impostor.

1143
01:17:19,306 --> 01:17:21,408
Impostor?
You, my friend,
are the impostor.

1144
01:17:21,542 --> 01:17:24,945
Yeah, how can you prove
that you're the real Shriver?

1145
01:17:25,078 --> 01:17:28,850
Why don't you look at
my driver's license
or any of my credit cards?

1146
01:17:28,982 --> 01:17:31,185
Here is my National Book Award.

1147
01:17:31,318 --> 01:17:33,620
This is, uh,
an invitation from the Clintons

1148
01:17:33,754 --> 01:17:36,825
to get
the National Prize
for Humanitarianism.

1149
01:17:36,957 --> 01:17:38,692
Bill's a personal friend.

1150
01:17:42,129 --> 01:17:44,631
Okay.
Yeah, it's pretty convincing.

1151
01:17:44,765 --> 01:17:47,601
You just carry this around
with you?
Yes, I do.

1152
01:17:49,203 --> 01:17:52,573
To think
I was actually beginning...

1153
01:17:57,377 --> 01:17:58,111
Simone.

1154
01:17:58,245 --> 01:17:59,613
Thank you.

1155
01:18:00,047 --> 01:18:01,381
Hmm.

1156
01:18:01,515 --> 01:18:03,283
You're welcome to
come hear me read

1157
01:18:03,417 --> 01:18:06,286
if you can
stomach the humiliation.

1158
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:08,655
Excuse me.
Where are you going?

1159
01:18:15,964 --> 01:18:17,598
Shriver, who is that guy?

1160
01:18:20,167 --> 01:18:22,269
He's me, I guess.

1161
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:28,609
It's okay.

1162
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:42,756
That other Shriver
is probably
with her right now.

1163
01:18:45,125 --> 01:18:48,195
She's kissing him,
saying, "Oh, Shriver."

1164
01:18:48,328 --> 01:18:50,230
Shut up. She's not.

1165
01:18:50,364 --> 01:18:53,367
I think she has
a weakness for writers.

1166
01:18:54,002 --> 01:18:55,068
Yeah.

1167
01:18:55,202 --> 01:18:57,404
I mean, who wouldn't?
Of course.

1168
01:18:57,538 --> 01:19:00,440
You forget, Mr. Shriver,
that I knew Ms. Cleary

1169
01:19:00,574 --> 01:19:04,311
way back
when she was Simone Wasserman.

1170
01:19:06,613 --> 01:19:09,049
Oh, wow.

1171
01:19:09,182 --> 01:19:10,784
You didn't know.

1172
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:20,527
So, he's the one
who broke her heart.

1173
01:19:20,661 --> 01:19:25,666
No. She chucked him
like a stinky old shoe
years ago.

1174
01:19:25,799 --> 01:19:27,100
Ah...

1175
01:19:28,735 --> 01:19:31,438
He wasn't always
the pickled poet
you see today.

1176
01:19:31,572 --> 01:19:33,841
He was her teacher.
Well, her mentor.

1177
01:19:33,975 --> 01:19:37,477
That was until
she clearly surpassed him
in every way.

1178
01:19:38,478 --> 01:19:42,182
People started paying attention,
and he couldn't deal.

1179
01:19:42,316 --> 01:19:44,117
He undermined her confidence

1180
01:19:44,251 --> 01:19:47,387
and dragged her down
every chance he got.

1181
01:19:47,521 --> 01:19:49,857
It's crazy because
I recognized her

1182
01:19:49,991 --> 01:19:54,494
in this article that I was
reading about impostor syndrome
in high-achieving women.

1183
01:19:54,628 --> 01:19:57,264
Now, you wouldn't get this
'cause you're a man,

1184
01:19:58,398 --> 01:20:00,334
but, basically,
she believed his bullshit,

1185
01:20:00,467 --> 01:20:02,102
and she lost her confidence.

1186
01:20:02,235 --> 01:20:06,874
But eventually,
she got the courage
to give him the old heave-ho.

1187
01:20:09,944 --> 01:20:12,212
And he has been spending
the last five years

1188
01:20:12,346 --> 01:20:14,916
desperately
trying to make amends.

1189
01:20:15,049 --> 01:20:16,951
And that and drinking.

1190
01:20:17,085 --> 01:20:18,953
There you are.
Oh, Jesus.

1191
01:20:19,087 --> 01:20:20,387
What?

1192
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:23,123
I have been looking
all over for you,
Shriver.

1193
01:20:25,192 --> 01:20:26,961
What's new, Detective?

1194
01:20:27,095 --> 01:20:31,131
Well, I had a nice chat
with, uh,
one of the cheerleaders

1195
01:20:31,264 --> 01:20:33,367
in town for the competition
earlier tonight.

1196
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:36,503
Uh, Sophie something.
She's a lovely girl.

1197
01:20:36,637 --> 01:20:38,472
Beautiful young lady.
Yeah.

1198
01:20:38,605 --> 01:20:40,707
You know,
if I ever have a daughter,

1199
01:20:40,842 --> 01:20:44,144
she's exactly what I imagined
she'd be like at that age.

1200
01:20:44,277 --> 01:20:47,681
Anyway,
she said she saw Ms. Brown
in your room late that night.

1201
01:20:49,549 --> 01:20:51,886
She said she saw Ms. Brown?

1202
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:54,788
She was, uh--

1203
01:20:54,922 --> 01:20:57,324
Yeah, she was--
she was performing
an aerial flip.

1204
01:20:57,457 --> 01:21:00,394
Pretty much
as you described it
earlier today.

1205
01:21:00,527 --> 01:21:03,397
She said Ms. Brown
was passed out on your bed.

1206
01:21:04,665 --> 01:21:07,068
I have no recollection of that.

1207
01:21:07,935 --> 01:21:10,704
You're the last known
sighting of our poet.

1208
01:21:11,906 --> 01:21:13,273
Excuse me. I'm sorry,

1209
01:21:13,407 --> 01:21:15,275
are you trying to insinuate
that Mr. Shriver had any--

1210
01:21:15,409 --> 01:21:17,244
Everyone's a suspect.

1211
01:21:17,812 --> 01:21:18,846
Everyone.

1212
01:21:19,579 --> 01:21:20,580
Okay.

1213
01:21:20,714 --> 01:21:22,817
Well, then are you
investigating the impostor

1214
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:26,054
that is running around here
pretending to be our Shriver?

1215
01:21:26,186 --> 01:21:28,956
Impostor?
Okay.
Yeah.

1216
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:31,125
And while you're in
your little notebook...
Uh-huh.

1217
01:21:31,258 --> 01:21:36,363
...also take note
that Ms. Brown had left the room
while I was in there.

1218
01:21:41,401 --> 01:21:43,171
Sophie didn't mention
seeing you there.

1219
01:21:43,303 --> 01:21:45,739
Yeah, well,
I must have been in the can.

1220
01:21:48,876 --> 01:21:49,911
I see.

1221
01:21:53,313 --> 01:21:54,982
Hmm.
Hey, Detective.

1222
01:21:55,116 --> 01:21:58,086
Didn't you say you were trying
to track down my ex-wife?

1223
01:21:58,218 --> 01:21:59,753
Yeah. Yeah,
that is an interesting case.

1224
01:21:59,887 --> 01:22:02,857
But I believe
the answers are out there.

1225
01:22:02,990 --> 01:22:04,959
Hey, some might be in here.

1226
01:22:18,072 --> 01:22:19,539
Wow.

1227
01:22:19,673 --> 01:22:25,378
This is probably
the best festival
I've ever been to.

1228
01:22:25,512 --> 01:22:27,314
This shit is wild!

1229
01:22:54,374 --> 01:22:55,575
Hi.

1230
01:22:55,709 --> 01:22:56,878
Hi.

1231
01:22:58,712 --> 01:23:02,282
Uh, I locked my key
in my room, so...

1232
01:23:02,749 --> 01:23:03,851
Oh.

1233
01:23:03,985 --> 01:23:04,986
Sorry.

1234
01:23:05,485 --> 01:23:07,021
You look stressed.

1235
01:23:07,155 --> 01:23:10,390
Things are going poorly for me.

1236
01:23:10,524 --> 01:23:12,827
They say you're a famous writer
named Shriver.

1237
01:23:14,061 --> 01:23:17,064
There seems to be
some disagreement about that.

1238
01:23:18,498 --> 01:23:19,901
I'm gonna cheer for you.

1239
01:23:22,003 --> 01:23:24,138

01:23:36,117 --> 01:23:37,517
Seems to.

1245
01:23:40,822 --> 01:23:43,024
Finals are today.
Good luck.

1246
01:23:43,157 --> 01:23:44,758
Don't need it.

1247
01:23:47,694 --> 01:23:49,362
Hey, excuse me. I, uh--

1248
01:23:49,496 --> 01:23:52,867
I need a key for my room.
I got locked out of my room
yesterday.

1249
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,467
Um...

1250
01:23:55,468 --> 01:23:57,004
I don't seem to have one.

1251
01:23:58,471 --> 01:24:00,842
What about the maid?
Does the maid have one?

1252
01:24:00,975 --> 01:24:03,878
Why don't you go
grab some breakfast
while I go find her?

1253
01:24:04,377 --> 01:24:05,445
Hmm.

1254
01:24:05,579 --> 01:24:08,381
Oh, wait.
She's out sick today.

1255
01:24:08,515 --> 01:24:10,483
She-- You--

1256
01:24:10,617 --> 01:24:12,452
What do you mean?
What kind of hotel is this?

1257
01:24:12,586 --> 01:24:14,222
You got one maid
for the whole place?

1258
01:24:14,354 --> 01:24:16,790
Yeah. She's really fast.

1259
01:24:16,924 --> 01:24:19,026
Who is this guy?

1260
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:21,428
He's me, apparently.

1261
01:24:22,263 --> 01:24:23,630
What? Okay,

1262
01:24:23,763 --> 01:24:28,401
I heard that you explored
Dr. Bedrosian's library.

1263
01:24:29,436 --> 01:24:30,972
I swear to God,
I didn't do anything.

1264
01:24:31,105 --> 01:24:33,707
Really? You'd be the first.
Yeah.

1265
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:37,812
Uh-oh.

1266
01:24:37,945 --> 01:24:39,914
Oh, don't--
don't say I'm here.

1267
01:24:42,083 --> 01:24:44,684
Teresa. Have you seen him?

1268
01:24:44,819 --> 01:24:46,553
- Seen who?
- You know who.

1269
01:24:46,686 --> 01:24:48,755
I'll bet you
that's his porridge.

1270
01:24:50,024 --> 01:24:52,026
Well, is-- is it his?

1271
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:53,526
He left.

1272
01:24:56,763 --> 01:25:00,368
The lady from the college
says you have to be out of
your room by checkout time.

1273
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:01,936
When's checkout time?

1274
01:25:02,069 --> 01:25:03,204
Half an hour ago.

1275
01:25:03,337 --> 01:25:05,339
We're gonna have to
charge you for an extra day.

1276
01:25:05,472 --> 01:25:06,874
May I have a credit card?

1277
01:25:07,774 --> 01:25:09,542
<i>All right,</i>

1278
01:25:09,676 --> 01:25:12,646
you can stay
at my place
just until we find the key.

1279
01:25:12,779 --> 01:25:14,882
Oh, damn.
It's not that bad.

1280
01:25:15,016 --> 01:25:16,117
Not that.

1281
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:19,020
You made my month, friend.

1282
01:25:19,153 --> 01:25:23,057
You have given me
the literary story of the year.

1283
01:25:23,190 --> 01:25:28,195
An impostor shows up
pretending to be
the reclusive author.

1284
01:25:28,329 --> 01:25:31,999
My story forces
the real author
out of hiding.

1285
01:25:32,133 --> 01:25:35,468
I mean,
this is just
unbelievably ironic.

1286
01:25:35,602 --> 01:25:37,504
I'm gonna sell it
to <i>The New Yorker.</i>

1287
01:25:39,173 --> 01:25:41,175
All right, let's go.

1288
01:25:41,309 --> 01:25:42,542
Sorry.

1289
01:25:45,445 --> 01:25:47,815
Are you good in there?

1290
01:25:48,682 --> 01:25:50,318
I'm fine.

1291
01:25:53,154 --> 01:25:55,655
All right, where is he?

1292
01:25:57,258 --> 01:25:58,859
Shriver!

1293
01:25:58,993 --> 01:26:00,261
Shriver!

1294
01:26:00,394 --> 01:26:01,896
Shriver.

1295
01:26:04,398 --> 01:26:05,699
Shriver!

1296
01:26:05,833 --> 01:26:08,802
Shriver! What are you
gonna do about this?

1297
01:26:10,071 --> 01:26:11,538
I need a towel.

1298
01:26:13,307 --> 01:26:17,711
This is one of
the great literary hoaxes
of all time.

1299
01:26:17,845 --> 01:26:20,881
We have a brazen impostor
in our midst.

1300
01:26:21,015 --> 01:26:22,850
Well, are you talking about
me or him?

1301
01:26:22,984 --> 01:26:26,720
When I first heard about
the charlatan,
I so wanted to believe him.

1302
01:26:27,554 --> 01:26:30,757
Okay, I--
I doubted you for a moment.

1303
01:26:32,126 --> 01:26:33,660
I was jealous.

1304
01:26:33,793 --> 01:26:36,663
I could see my ex-wife was
falling in love with you.

1305
01:26:37,298 --> 01:26:38,798
Love?
Never in my days

1306
01:26:38,933 --> 01:26:40,835
have I seen a writer,
a real writer,

1307
01:26:40,968 --> 01:26:44,839
who didn't walk around thinking
his shit didn't smell like
eau de cologne.

1308
01:26:44,972 --> 01:26:46,706
But you, Shriver...

1309
01:26:46,841 --> 01:26:49,443
...you walk around like
an insecure grad student,

1310
01:26:49,576 --> 01:26:51,212
waiting for someone
to come up and say,

1311
01:26:51,345 --> 01:26:55,682
"Okay, time to hang up the pen.
Start mongering fish
for a living."

1312
01:26:57,584 --> 01:26:59,020
What happened to you?

1313
01:27:00,754 --> 01:27:02,655
I have theories.

1314
01:27:03,124 --> 01:27:04,291
Me too.

1315
01:27:04,425 --> 01:27:06,793
You're crazy.

1316
01:27:06,927 --> 01:27:09,363
You know how I know that?
'Cause I'm crazy too.

1317
01:27:09,497 --> 01:27:12,033
I'm just not crazy enough
to believe for a moment

1318
01:27:12,166 --> 01:27:14,701
that you aren't
the author of <i>Goat Time.</i>

1319
01:27:14,835 --> 01:27:17,604
Now, get your ass out of there.
Come on.

1320
01:27:17,737 --> 01:27:22,243
In 15 minutes, that fraud
is gonna be feted
by the university president.

1321
01:27:22,376 --> 01:27:24,845
Then he's going to be escorted
over to the auditorium,

1322
01:27:24,979 --> 01:27:29,783
where he's gonna read
from your book
and claim your prize.

1323
01:27:29,917 --> 01:27:31,718
And, no, it's not a car.

1324
01:27:31,852 --> 01:27:34,621
It's a crappy plaque.

1325
01:27:46,633 --> 01:27:47,868
We're off.

1326
01:27:49,470 --> 01:27:51,505
Where's Teresa?
Oh.

1327
01:27:51,638 --> 01:27:54,542
She went over to straighten out
your situation at the hotel.

1328
01:27:54,674 --> 01:27:56,343
How we gonna get to
the university?

1329
01:28:38,785 --> 01:28:40,154
Here you go, my good man.

1330
01:28:41,455 --> 01:28:44,391
Ah, if it isn't
Victor Lustig here
to sell us the Eiffel Tower.

1331
01:28:44,525 --> 01:28:46,160
Ladies and gentlemen,

1332
01:28:46,293 --> 01:28:48,929
- I give you Shriver.
- What's going on here?

1333
01:28:49,063 --> 01:28:51,198
Okay, you got a lot of balls.
The both of you.

1334
01:28:51,332 --> 01:28:53,766
No, I--
I just wanna apologize.
That's all.

1335
01:28:53,901 --> 01:28:55,069
What the hell for?

1336
01:28:55,202 --> 01:28:57,338
Because I came here
under false pretenses.

1337
01:28:57,471 --> 01:28:59,073
Apology not accepted.

1338
01:29:01,641 --> 01:29:03,577
That man is a fraud.
Oh, come on.

1339
01:29:03,710 --> 01:29:08,015
A fake. An impostor.
Would you shut up,
you smelly old drunk?

1340
01:29:08,149 --> 01:29:11,085
Say what you need to say
and you go.

1341
01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:14,288
Go get her, Shriver.

1342
01:29:30,204 --> 01:29:34,275
Look, first of all, I, uh--
I really just wanted to say

1343
01:29:34,408 --> 01:29:38,445
what a privilege it has been
for me to be here,

1344
01:29:39,647 --> 01:29:41,549
to be amongst all of you.

1345
01:29:41,681 --> 01:29:47,488
Mr. Bennet, I am so looking
forward to finally attending
one of your performances.

1346
01:29:48,222 --> 01:29:51,458
I wish that Ms. Brown was here,

1347
01:29:51,592 --> 01:29:56,030
but I'm going to read
every single one of her poems.

1348
01:29:57,764 --> 01:29:59,934
And, uh, to Ms. Layla,

1349
01:30:00,067 --> 01:30:03,037
I hope one day
that you'll do me the privilege

1350
01:30:03,170 --> 01:30:06,073
of allowing me to eat
one of your sculptures.

1351
01:30:06,207 --> 01:30:11,778
T., Ms. Teresa, all of you,
just such extraordinary people.

1352
01:30:11,912 --> 01:30:15,715
You've treated me
with respect and courtesy,

1353
01:30:15,849 --> 01:30:17,818
and I will always remember you.

1354
01:30:18,552 --> 01:30:20,454
Very fondly.

1355
01:30:23,190 --> 01:30:26,026
But most of all, I wanted
to thank Professor Cleary

1356
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:31,398
for allowing me the opportunity
to find myself.

1357
01:30:32,333 --> 01:30:33,300
It's a--

1358
01:30:33,434 --> 01:30:34,668
This is wonderful.

1359
01:30:34,801 --> 01:30:37,037
This is the most
wonderful thing
I've read in ages.

1360
01:30:37,171 --> 01:30:39,306
She was hiding in your room
the whole time.

1361
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:42,209
I fell asleep under your bed
and woke up yesterday afternoon.

1362
01:30:42,343 --> 01:30:45,312
I didn't wanna deal with Layla,
so I started writing
some new poetry,

1363
01:30:45,446 --> 01:30:49,683
and when you didn't come back
to your hotel room last night,
I figured I'd stay another day.

1364
01:30:49,817 --> 01:30:51,751
And that's--

1365
01:30:51,885 --> 01:30:53,786
That's when I found this.

1366
01:30:53,921 --> 01:30:56,657
This masterpiece.

1367
01:30:57,224 --> 01:30:58,758
What did you eat?

1368
01:30:58,892 --> 01:31:00,828
Just sort of curious, I guess.

1369
01:31:00,961 --> 01:31:02,863
His granola bars.

1370
01:31:03,864 --> 01:31:05,366
In your tote bag.

1371
01:31:05,499 --> 01:31:09,069
Okay, okay, okay. Can we please
put an end to this buffoonery?

1372
01:31:09,203 --> 01:31:10,704
I'm sorry. This is ridiculous.
I--

1373
01:31:10,838 --> 01:31:11,771
Come on, Simone.

1374
01:31:11,905 --> 01:31:13,641
Uh, who's this?

1375
01:31:13,773 --> 01:31:15,576
Well, I think Shriver--

1376
01:31:15,709 --> 01:31:16,744
Yes, I'm Shriver.

1377
01:31:16,877 --> 01:31:18,679
That's-- That's cuckoo.

1378
01:31:19,079 --> 01:31:20,547
You're cuckoo.

1379
01:31:24,251 --> 01:31:27,288
May I present Mr. Cheadum.

1380
01:31:28,122 --> 01:31:30,790
Shriver's agent.

1381
01:31:30,924 --> 01:31:32,626
Good to see you again, Shriver.

1382
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:34,328
Good to see you.
Looking good.
Yes.

1383
01:31:34,461 --> 01:31:36,563
Thank you.
Well, this settles that.
So why don't you two--

1384
01:31:36,697 --> 01:31:37,831
Settles what?

1385
01:31:37,965 --> 01:31:41,001
This is the real Shriver.

1386
01:31:41,402 --> 01:31:42,503
Oh.

1387
01:31:42,636 --> 01:31:43,837
I'm sorry.
No, it's--

1388
01:31:43,971 --> 01:31:45,973
Sorry.
No. What are you sorry about?

1389
01:31:49,176 --> 01:31:51,545
You don't know your own clients?

1390
01:31:52,212 --> 01:31:53,714
Oh, well,
we've only met once,

1391
01:31:53,847 --> 01:31:55,382
and I was 15.

1392
01:31:55,516 --> 01:31:58,352
Uh, my father was
Mr. Shriver's original agent,

1393
01:31:58,485 --> 01:32:01,555
and I inherited him
with the agency.

1394
01:32:06,627 --> 01:32:08,062
Okay, nobody move.

1395
01:32:09,963 --> 01:32:14,835
Jesus fucking Christ, Simone.
What have you
brought down on us?

1396
01:32:14,968 --> 01:32:18,172
Would the, uh, real Shriver
please step forward?

1397
01:32:23,477 --> 01:32:26,280
Come on, is nobody here
the author of this book?

1398
01:32:26,413 --> 01:32:30,584
This kaleidoscopic dissection
of the human condition?

1399
01:32:30,718 --> 01:32:33,253
This phantasmagorical allegory?

1400
01:32:34,388 --> 01:32:35,789
This is Shriver.

1401
01:32:36,523 --> 01:32:38,492
And I just wanna say
I'm so sorry.

1402
01:32:38,625 --> 01:32:39,960
Not so fast, Professor.

1403
01:32:40,094 --> 01:32:41,328
That's not Shriver.

1404
01:32:41,462 --> 01:32:44,565
Ms. Brown.
I will note that you are alive.

1405
01:32:44,698 --> 01:32:47,134
So, you say you're Shriver?

1406
01:32:47,601 --> 01:32:49,069
Absolutely.

1407
01:32:54,441 --> 01:32:56,276
What is going on? Simone.
Wait. Stop it.

1408
01:32:56,410 --> 01:32:58,145
What are you doing
with Mr. Shriver?
Would you please tell him--

1409
01:32:58,278 --> 01:33:01,215
This is crazy.
That's not Mr. Shriver.

1410
01:33:03,818 --> 01:33:06,286
Why are you doing that?
I'm-- This is ridiculous.

1411
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:08,322
Simone,
will you please tell them--
Shut up, please.

1412
01:33:08,455 --> 01:33:11,358
This man
is a professional impostor.
What?

1413
01:33:11,492 --> 01:33:14,027
Yeah. His real name:
Herbert Davies.

1414
01:33:14,161 --> 01:33:15,763
He's from Baltimore.
Never been there.

1415
01:33:15,896 --> 01:33:18,132
This guy has claimed to be
a number of important people,

1416
01:33:18,265 --> 01:33:20,134
including the Chairman
of the Federal Reserve...

1417
01:33:20,267 --> 01:33:24,471
I don't even know what that is.
...and the Archbishop
of Canterbury.

1418
01:33:25,506 --> 01:33:27,941
- Yeah, just-- just do it. Do it.
- Stop running!

1419
01:33:28,075 --> 01:33:29,710
- Oh, my God.
- Get him!

1420
01:33:29,844 --> 01:33:31,678
- Someone do something.
- There he goes.

1421
01:33:31,813 --> 01:33:35,115
Apparently, it's gotten him
into bed with a lot of women.

1422
01:33:35,249 --> 01:33:38,385
- Several men.
- They got him. They got him.

1423
01:33:41,355 --> 01:33:43,457
Stop resisting.

1424
01:33:43,590 --> 01:33:49,396
Byron, I think this
puts us back
on the literary map.

1425
01:33:51,866 --> 01:33:54,001
I'm so embarrassed.

1426
01:33:55,969 --> 01:33:57,906
I was so ready to doubt you. I--

1427
01:33:58,038 --> 01:33:59,273
No.

1428
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:02,709
I doubted myself. I just--

1429
01:34:02,844 --> 01:34:06,513
When you said you would show up,

1430
01:34:06,647 --> 01:34:09,116
I thought it was too good
to be true.

1431
01:34:11,185 --> 01:34:12,753
I wasn't listening
to the part of myself

1432
01:34:12,887 --> 01:34:16,223
that absolutely knew
that only you
could write that book.

1433
01:34:18,625 --> 01:34:21,261
Well, how could you have known
when I didn't?

1434
01:34:27,701 --> 01:34:29,269
You knew you wrote it.

1435
01:34:30,839 --> 01:34:32,473
You didn't think you wrote it.

1436
01:34:33,373 --> 01:34:35,075
That's why you came here.

1437
01:34:44,618 --> 01:34:46,086
Can we start over?

1438
01:34:49,858 --> 01:34:50,657
What?

1439
01:34:50,791 --> 01:34:52,125
You know,

1440
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:55,362
like, from the beginning.

1441
01:34:55,496 --> 01:34:57,966
Just start over.
None of that happened.

1442
01:35:03,036 --> 01:35:04,271
Hi.

1443
01:35:05,807 --> 01:35:07,341
I'm Simone Cleary.

1444
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:14,983
Are you ready?

1445
01:35:15,115 --> 01:35:16,483
Mmm.

1446
01:35:16,617 --> 01:35:18,018
I'm nervous.

1447
01:35:18,151 --> 01:35:19,954
I'll never forget the first time
I met Mr. Shriver.

1448
01:35:20,087 --> 01:35:23,925
My father, he said
to me, he said, "Donny,
meet Mr. Shriver,

1449
01:35:24,057 --> 01:35:25,325
the best writer
you'll ever know."

1450
01:35:25,459 --> 01:35:27,494
Some years later, my father...

1451
01:35:27,628 --> 01:35:29,196
You'll be fine.

1452
01:35:30,097 --> 01:35:32,000
...how over drinks one night,
he told me...

1453
01:35:34,568 --> 01:35:35,602
Thank you.

1454
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:00,494
And I am...

1455
01:36:02,729 --> 01:36:03,764
Shriver.

1456
01:36:08,135 --> 01:36:10,337
"The watermark
appeared on my ceiling

1457
01:36:10,470 --> 01:36:14,207
on the rainy day
my wife walked out on me.

1458
01:36:15,009 --> 01:36:17,678
At first,
it was just a small spot,

1459
01:36:17,812 --> 01:36:20,314
approximately the size
of a quarter..."
