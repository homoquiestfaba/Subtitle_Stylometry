I don't have time to
worry about how it happened.

3
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:10,698
It is what it is.

4
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:15,405
We're enetically engineered
to stop aging at 25.

5
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,473
The trouble is, we live only one more year

6
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,407
unless we can get more time.

7
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:28,243
Time is now the currency.

8
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:31,916
We earn it and spend it.

9
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,258
The rich can live forever.

10
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,495
And the rest ofus?

11
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,228
I just want to wake up
with more time on my hand

12
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,996
than hours in the day.

13
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,592
Hey, Mom.

14
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:17,562
You got in late last night.

15
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,229
I put in some overtime.

16
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:20,531
Where'd it go?

17
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,063
On you.

18
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:25,104
They drink it in New Greenwich.
Happy 5oth!

19
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,268
Fifty?

20
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,078
That's right.

21
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,977
Twenty-five for the 25th time.

22
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,982
Oh, I was sure I'd have a grandchild by now.

23
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,244
Here we go.

24
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,017
Bela's daughter is always asking about you.

25
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:41,754
Who has time for a girlfriend?
Besides, what's the hurry?

26
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,659
What do you got?

27
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,323
Three days. Not even.

28
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,997
We owe half that in rent.

29
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:51,161
Eight for the electric and
we're still late on that loan.

30
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,001
I can make extra on the side, you know.

31
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,102
- I could...
- What, start fighting?

32
00:02:58,778 --> 00:02:59,767

33
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,469

00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:03,977
Remember, I'm not here tonight.

36
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,540
I got two days' work in the garment district.

37
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,184
- I know.
- Meet me at the bus stop tomorrow.

38
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,346
- After I pay off the loan, I won't have long.
- I'll be there.

39
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,952
Will...

40
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,684
I just wouldn't know what to do if I lost you.

41
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:16,955
I'm late.

42
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,791
Let me give you 3o minutes
so you can have a decent lunch.

43
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,806
I love you.

44
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,809
Happy birthday, Mom.

45
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,948
When you get back,
we're going to celebrate.

46
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,492
GIRL: Will!

47
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:54,822
Will!

48
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:56,824
You got a minute?

49
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,868
What are you talking about, Mya?
You have a whole year.

50
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,071
Not a year I can use yet.

51
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,904
Come on, Will. I've got bills to pay.

52
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,208
Here, take five minutes.

53
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,080
Get out of here.

54
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,928
Four minutes for a cup of coffee?

55
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,438
Yesterday, it was three.

56
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,439
You want coffee or you want to reminisce?

57
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,039
Two coffees.

58
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,104
- How many shifts you got today, Borel?
- Just the two.

59
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,880
Really excited about it.

60
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:50,117
If you had any of your father in you,
we could make a fortune.

61
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,223
I don't fight.

62
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,296
There's another one. Broad daylight.

63
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:35,226
Whoa, what is this? Where's the rest?

64
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,459
Never met the quota.

65
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,003
My units are up from last week.

66
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,934
So's the quota. Next.

67
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,132
That's a joke, right?

68
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,634
- Next.
- MAN: Move it. You're taking forever.

You in, Will?

71
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,126
I don't have time to gamble anymore.

72
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,855
Oh, thank God.

73
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:09,958

I started winning.

They are going to kill you.

Please, take me home. Please.

00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:51,767
- I can't do that.
- Why?

You're keeping me alive.

00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,003

You guys wasted a gorgeous car.

Who it was.

He's done in minutes.

561
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:49,850
He'll wake up dead. That'll be a shock.

562
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,693
Too bad. I would have preferred to
kill him more beautifully.

563

The girl's still breathing.

564

had more than a century.

Yeah, we're not alive for long, either.

left here with more than minutes.
