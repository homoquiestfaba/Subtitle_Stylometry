1
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,333
[ANNOUNCER] I want you
to help me give a warm Viva Welcome

2
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:46,296
to your royal ambassador,
Miss Ruth Elliott.

3
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,345
[RUTH] Thank you.

4
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:58,016
Thank you all.

5
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:05,148
Sometimes I wonder if my
life really didn't begin

6
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:10,237
until I had my first child.

7
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:15,325
[RUTH] And everything
else was just training.

8
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:20,706
The same miracle plays out
every day all over the world.

9
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:27,379
Not just a baby being born. It's a family.

10
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,725
[RUTH] Jeff and I were
high school sweethearts,

11
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:44,228
married young because all
we had was each other,

12
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,023
and we set out to build a life together.

13
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:50,109
[RUTH] We found an old farmhouse
way out in the country,

14
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,571
tore it down to the studs,
and built our dream.

15
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:56,240
Which, after all the building and fencing

16
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,618
and clearing and a couple of horses to run,

17
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,453
really came down to the one thing that

18
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:04,333
both of us had always wanted: a family.

19
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,419
[RUTH] We're big on love
in the Elliott house,

20
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,505
but we're also a competitive lot.

21
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:15,343
Jeff was a three sport athlete,
played football in college,

22
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:19,306
and I'm not crazy about losing at anything.

23
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,019
[RUTH] Jen was a born runner and jumper.

24
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,189
Little brother, Eric, who
we nicknamed "Hoovey,"

25
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,566
could play most anything.

26
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:34,195
But it was pretty obvious pretty quick...

27
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:37,115
He was born to play this game.

28
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,204
That a boy!

29
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:45,373
[RUTH] Hoovey wasn't the
biggest or the fastest,

30
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:48,669
or the highest jumper on the floor.

31
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,546
[RUTH] What my boy had was vision.

32
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:55,257
He could see the whole court in one look,

33
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:59,221
and as we would find out,
a long way past it, too.

34
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,515
One thing I know for sure now,

35
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,601
life can change in a heartbeat.

36
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,229
[RUTH] And even with that gift of vision,

37
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,525
you can still get knocked
down and never see it coming.

38
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,531
[RUTH] And there's not a lot
of cushion on that floor.

39
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:23,245
[RUTH] Then, it comes down to faith.

40
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,999
5"'

41
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,095
[rooster crows]

42
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,266
[JEFF] A little nippy
last night, huh girls?

43
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,500
[JEN] Hoovey!

44
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,470
[RUTH] Don't bounce that ball in the house.

45
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,306
[HOOVEY] Okay.

46
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,435
[RUTH] Just one. Oh, and wear a coat, okay?

47
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,021
[HOOVEY] Okay.

48
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,460
[JEFF] Big day. You ready?

49
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:58,423
[HOOVEY] Am I ready? You
make me laugh, Big Boy.

50
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:02,551
[JEFF] Big Boy? I'll tell
you what, Little Pinto,

51
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,428
old man's gonna take your little fanny to

52
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,388
hoop school right here and now.

53
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,389
[HOOVEY] Uh-huh?

54
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,641
[JEFF] Class is in session.

55
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,352
[HOOVEY] Okay.

56
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,526
[HOOVEY] Need some more coffee, Big Boy?

57
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,403
[HOOVEY] Elliott breezes
through the much older,

58
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,490
but not necessarily wiser,
Notre Dame back court.

59
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,953
[HOOVEY] And the crowd goes crazy.

60
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,212
[RUTH] Oh, hey, Sleeping Beauty.

61
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:41,382
Is it a full marathon today or just a half?

62
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,717
It isn't really 24 outside?

63
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,261
[RUTH] It's a dry 24.

64
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,221
I want to live in Hawaii.

65
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,015
[RUTH] Oh, you do, do ya?

66
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,392
Whoa, Mom,

67
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,143
what's up with the whole can of frosting?

68
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:56,398
Who cares? Bikini season is over.

69
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,527
[HOOVEY] After learning
what I can from my wise,

70
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,280
but limited, old man,

71
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,241
I lead our high school to the state finals.

72
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,702
After we win, I sign with Indiana

73
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,621
and I take us to the Final
Four in my first year.

74
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,207
That's my plan.

75
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,002
[JEFF] You know how to
make God laugh, right?

76
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,253
Tell Him your plans.

77
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:22,423
[JEFF] I know one thing.
If that plan has a chance,

78
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,174
you better learn to go left.

79
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,092
What are you talking about?

80
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,136
You go right every single time.

81
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,470
I'm stronger going right.

82
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,222
Our offense rotates that way.

83
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,307
It's not going to work forever champ.

84
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,391
They're going to figure it out.

85
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,310
If you can take it strong either way,

86
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,104
you're going to own the court.

87
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,650
[JEFF] But you're never
going to own your old man.

88
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,401
[JEFF] Give it up.

89
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,070
[JEN] Mom, I'm not sure
I want to run anymore.

90
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,239
[RUTH] Oh, honey, it's just a cold morning.

91
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,574
[JEN] It's not that.

92
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,326
It's just not fun anymore.

93
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:51,702
My heart's not in it.

94
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,120
It hasn't been for a while.

95
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,246
[RUTH] But you're winning,

96
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,500
and girl you're on track to break records.

97
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:02,130
I tried out for the fall play...
and I got a callback.

98
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,215
[RUTH] Really?

99
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,425
[JEN] Yeah.

100
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,553
Well, why can't you do both?

101
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,180
[JEN] Rehearsals are in the afternoon.

102
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,266
[JEN] It's the same time as track.

103
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,143
[JEFF] Okay, I'll let you have this.

104
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:16,936
You got it.

105
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,438
I'll let you have it.

106
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,487
[JEFF] Bam.

107
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,154
[JEFF] Take it back.

108
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,405
[HOOVEY] Here we go.

109
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,240
[HOOVEY] Whoa. Ah!

110
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,494
[JEFF] Hey buddy... whoa whoa...
you alright there?

111
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,245
[HOOVEY] Yeah. This keeps happening.

112
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,246
It's my eyes again.

113
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,331
They just blur on me.

114
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,375
Alright, that's it. We're
getting you checked out today.

115
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,209
I'll be fine.

116
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,502
[JEFF] Stop fighting me on this.

117
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:45,048
Look, you wouldn't be the first
player to wear glasses, slick.

118
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,513
[JEFF] Oh, I smell bacon!

119
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,183
Better be four pounds of it!

120
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,311
[JEFF] Everything okay?

121
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,688
Glass.

122
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:01,605
Yeah, it's fine.

123
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,192
I'll see you guys later.

124
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,945
[RUTH] No, no, no, no. Jen, wait.

125
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:08,737
[RUTH] Let's talk about this.

126
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:12,366
[RUTH] Jeff, Jen has had it with running.

127
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,994
Oh.

128
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,705
Okay.

129
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,747
Okay?

130
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,042
[JEFF] When the season's over, you're done.

131
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,086
I meant now.

132
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,672
Well, you got a team that's
counting on you, so...

133
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,092
[JEFF] We don't quit in this family, do we?

134
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:32,553
Fine.

135
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:36,098
I will run the season out
and then maybe after

136
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,558
I'm just gonna run away from home.

137
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,476
That's a lot of running for someone

138
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,228
who doesn't want to run anymore.

139
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,521
[JEN] oh, very funny-.

140
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,025
Just hysterical.

141
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,360
I thought it was funny.

142
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,572
Eat your bacon, Elliott.

143
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:56,995
[HOOVEY] a... M... E...

144
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,414
[DR. BACKUS] Okay.

145
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,375
[DR. BACKUS] Looks like you
have a slight astigmatism

146
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,711
in the right eye, so we're
gonna pick out some frames.

147
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,130
You mean glasses?

148
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,298
Can't I wear contacts?

149
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,632
[DR. BACKUS] Sure. Eventually.

150
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,425
[DR. BACKUS] But don't you want to

151
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,261
have perfect vision today?

152
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,266
[HOOVEY] I look like Poindexter, don't I?

153
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,143
Nah. Kurt Rambis.

154
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,352
Who is Kurt Rambis?

155
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,354
[JEFF] Who is Kurt Rambis?!

156
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,732
[JEFF] Mid-eighties. Showtime.
Three-peat Lakers?

157
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,609
I wasn't alive in the mid-eighties, Dad.

158
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,320
Nobody bang on the paint like Rambo.

159
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,197
You look just like him.

160
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:33,822
Really?

161
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:34,740
[JEFF] No, bad example.

162
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,368
He looked kind of creepy,
like a serial killer.

163
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,629
I want you to have something.

164
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,423
It was your grandfather's.

165
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,093
Oh, you think it'll help?

166
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,179
You'll never miss another three.

167
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,431
It's to remind you of
what's really important.

168
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,141
Thanks, Dad.

169
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,228
Sure thing, Poindexter.

170
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,417
Whoa! Check the rims.

171
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,921
Hey, call me four-eyes, we fight.

172
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,214
You hear about the new kid coming out?

173
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,423
[STUDENT] Big man!

174
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,591
He's a point guard just like you,

175
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:38,053
but he's supposed to be like, all world!

176
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,141
Check it... Hope those glasses help.

178
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,547
[COACH WILSON] Good afternoon gentlemen.

179
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,133
My name is Ed Wilson.

180
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:20,179
You may call me Coach Wilson.
You may call me Coach W.

181
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,557
You will not however address me as Ed.

182
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:27,520
And under no circumstances will
anybody ever call me Mr. Ed.

183
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:33,526
A team is defined as a group
comprised of individuals

184
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:38,280
united in the pursuit of a singular goal.

185
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:41,408
And this definition is best summarized

186
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,452
in a two letter pronoun.

187
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,663
And that word serves as the foundation

188
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:50,167
and the code of this team.

189
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:54,213
The word is "we"!

190
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,382
Five men represent fifteen and their coach

191
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:01,178
every second of every game.

192
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:04,097
Fifteen represent a school of a thousand.

193
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:08,060
That thousand represent
a thousand families,

194
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,146
their town, their nation.

195
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,982
"We"!

196
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,572
I've got fifteen uniforms.

197
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,033
Every one of then-rs available.

198
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,244
Let's see who wants them.

199
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,163
Alright... let's go. Baseline!

00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,666

201
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,502
Hit it... let's go... let's go.

Annie Linn? Is that you?

204
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,513
You're bigger. Taller I mean.

205
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,515
Well, I am a sophomore.

206
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,560
[HOOVEY] Why is it just last
year you were a freshman?

207
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,354
Nice glasses.

208
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,314
Hey... can I ask you something?

209
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,191
Umm... sure.

210
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,694
Why does everybody call you Hoovey?

211
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:02,657
I got my arm stuck in a Hoover
vacuum cleaner when I was three.

212
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,743
You laugh... do you know
how dramatic that was?

213
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,454
And then getting stuck
with a name like this...

214
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,332
I'm damaged good kid.

215
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,169
Eric's better. It has more "gravitas."

216
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,297
See you around Eric.

Now now you boys know I
don't comment on tryouts.

241
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,560
Well how about the new guy?
Any comment on him?

242
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,022
Like... who he is?

243
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,066
Yeah. He's uh... he's my nephew.

244
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:04,111
He's going to be staying
with me for awhile.

245
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,654
Boy had a little trouble at home.

246
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,072
He goes in for the layup...

247
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,241
and (non-sensical)... rejection!

248
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,617
That's not how it looked from my end.

249

You're welcome.

I owe you an apology.

256
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,010
It's a stupid joke.

257
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:32,305
It was a REALLY stupid joke...

258
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,058
but a good one! I
laughed the entire run.

wish we weren't so stupid.

00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:41,690
Why didn't you tell me you
wanted to be in the play?

I know.

[JEFF] Jen? I'm sorry. Forgive me.

266
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,739

aforementioned vehicle.

[JEFF] Well I don't make
enough to get you a Porsche...

269

and I'm not sure what
"aforementioned" means.

270
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,747
So maybe you can...

00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:01,001
explain it to me at Rick's
on Friday over dinner.

272
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:04,045
I'll bring an Auto Trader
and maybe I'll even shave.

Please God! PLEASE!

357
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:57,357
[JEFF] Don't go to sleep! You
gotta hang in there with me son!

358
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:59,568
You gotta stay awake!

You need help?

Who is it? Who's there?

362
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,252
Just get in and start it up.

363
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,419
Come on boys.

364
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:22,423
I'm dug into deep! If you
gotta truck I gotta chain!

365
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,133
[MAN] Just get in.

366
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,594
Start her up.

367
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,519
Come on!

368
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,566
Come on!

00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,779
[RUTH] The Bible says to be
watchful of who you meet.

370
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,740
You may be entertaining angels unaware.

371
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,577
Thank you!

372
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:54,330
[RUTH] Normal, Illinois is a small town.

373
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,749
Jeff had never seen those guys before

374
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,295
and he never saw them again.

375
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:17,187
[DR. KATINE] Double vision.
Can't keep his balance.

376
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:20,064
Does he got headaches or dizziness?

377
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,067
Yeah... all of that.

378
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:31,076
[RUTH] Uh... we're looking
for a patient Eric Elliott.

379
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,081
[RUTH] Oh! Jeff!

380
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,584
[JEN] Dad.

381
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:41,794
Hi.

382
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:42,378
Hi.

383
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:46,090
I'm Keith Kattner. I'm a
neurosurgeon on staff here.

384
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:50,054
The MRI has detected a tumor
at the base of his skull.

385
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,015
And it's a big one.

386
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:56,225
[DR.KATTNER] It's pressing up against his

387
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,102
medulla and optic nerve,

388
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,604
which explains the double vision.

389
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:00,688
[JEFF] Is it malignant?

390
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,066
<i>[DEL KATTNER] 1 won't. know
for sure uni.“ 1 biopsy it,</i>

391
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,734
but it's definitely got to come out.

392
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,027
Let's get it out.

393
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:09,030
But it's important that you
know the facts up front.

394
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,199
There are a lot of risks associated

395
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,575
with operating on the brain.

396
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:15,244
Can you be specific please?

397
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:18,706
[DR. KATTNER] There is a chance
that it could send Eric into

398
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,541
a severe coma and leave him

399
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,002
neurologically impaired for life.

400
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,672
There is that chance.

401
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,174
What are the chances?

402
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,551
Thirty percent statistically.

403
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,720
What if we don't operate?

404
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,723
[DR. KATTNER] The tumor is far
along and it's aggressive.

405
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:39,687
It will kill him one hundred percent.

406
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,523
[Ruth sobs]

407
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:50,030

[Hoovey utters something]

409
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:05,337
[HOOVEY] It's a brain tumor isn't it?

410
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,633
[JEFF] Yep.

411
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:13,094
It's actually kind of a relief.

412
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,722
Now I know why I was playing so bad.

413
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:18,058
You weren't playing bad.

414
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:22,229
Don't worry Dad.

415
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:26,525
If I... you know...

416
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,528
I know where I'm going.

417
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:32,531
[Jeff starts to cry]

418
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:37,411
We're going to get through this.

419
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:45,168
[RUTH] It is the one thing
every parent fears the most.

420
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:47,378
Something happening to our child.

421
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,173
Something we are powerless to stop.

422
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:53,927
And there is nothing you can do...
but pray.

423
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,521
[JEN] Dad...

424
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,482
How bad is it?

425
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:09,233
I mean like...

426
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:12,529
Could he... die?

427
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,033
That's not going to happen.

428
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,623
Is that up to you?

429
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:38,430
[DR. KATTNER] That's the
problem with the medulla...

430
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,306
[UNKNOWN] Vitals are stable.

431
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:43,726
[DR. KATTNER] And that can...
can be a problem.

432
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,605
[electric shears]

433
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,692
[VOICES ECHOING]

434
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:52,527
[DR. KATTNER] Alright... very nice.

435
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:55,572
Sponge. Okay... Good.

436
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,453
Right there.

[dramatic music]

438
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,741
[DR. KATTNER] It was benign and we got it.

439
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,243
He's out of the woods.

440
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,202
Can we see him?

441
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,620
[DR. KATTNER] Of course.
He's asleep right now,

442
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,039
but we'll wake him in about an hour.

443
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,458
Uh... there was a slight complication.

444
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:52,712
I had to remove a fairly
large section of bone

445
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:55,173
in an area dense with blood vessels...

446
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,508
Umm... we just can't graft
or put a plate there.

447
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:01,429
Over time soft tissue will
fill the gap, but until then

448
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,181
one well-placed blow to the head

449
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:05,266
would be catastrophic.

450
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:08,060
No sports... basketball?

451
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,270
<i>No.</i>

452
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,105
[RUTH] Can the tumor come back?

453
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,399
Well... there's always that possibility

454
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,067
so we'll have to monitor it,

455
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:18,029
and probably for the rest of his life.

456
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:21,365
But the good new is... he's going to have

457
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,036
a "rest of his life."

458
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:28,457
Thank you doctor! Thank you so much!

459
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:41,135

scary looking before.

gotta Captain Hook thing going.

Let's focus on getting back to
a hundred percent and then...

465
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,662
we'll cross that bridge. Alright?

No. Not yet.

It's a rule at the hospital.

00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,459
You have to have green jello.

00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:17,555
Well... I look like a complete freakazoid,

533
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,473
walk with a cane...

534
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,685
Other than that... I'm
the king of the world.

535
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:25,062
You know you are probably the only person

536
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,231
who could laugh through this.

537
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,108
Not much else I can do.

538
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,193
You know, I'm not much on sports,

539
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:34,029
but I've kinda got this
whole school thing down.

540
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,408
If you need help getting caught
up, or anything, I'm here.

541
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,367
I would like that.

542
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:39,410
Yeah!

543
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:43,373
But... can I ask you a really
embarrassing question first?

544
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,291
Okay.

545
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:48,420
Could you please help me get
this stupid locker open?

546
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:51,506
What's your combination?

547
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:55,468
Thirty-five.

548
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,136
Thirty-five.

549
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:58,137
Fourteen.

550
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,097
Fourteen.

551
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,098
Twelve.

552
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:02,517
Twelve.

553
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,020
There we go!

554
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:09,482
It's the deductibles and unpaid
expenses that's killing us.

555
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:12,360
Let's have it.

556
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:17,197
The city's helping, but it's not enough.

557
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:20,952
That's... can't be right.

558
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:25,540
It's a lot of money Elliott.
We're on the hook for it.

559
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,544
Okay.

560
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:33,380
Well... we got two foals
coming in a few months...

561
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,381
that's five grand right there.

562
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,549
<i>That?“ keep our heads above water</i>

563
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,718
until we get to the bottom of this.

564
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,511
Alright?

565
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,097
Okay.

566
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:45,434
[HOOVEY] (struggling) ...at the...
Bat-tle of... G-Gettys...

567
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:46,310
[RUTH] Gettysburg.

568
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:47,353
Gettysburg.

569
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:49,481
That's right. We're getting there.

570
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,233
[Hoovey growls]

571
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,568
[slams book]

572
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,112
[HOOVEY] Right. I can't see straight.

573
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,698
I can't read. Or or or walk.

574
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,742
And my left side has a mind of its own.

575
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:04,536
I don't know what "there"
you're talking about Mom,

576
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,956
but I'm not so sure I'm going to like it.

577
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:13,004
I heard you arguing on the phone.

578
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,674
Was it... a bill collector?

579
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,053
Yes.

580
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:24,723
It was. But she wished she hadn't called

581
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:27,018
after I got through with her.

582
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,019
I'm sorry mom...

583
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,647
You and Dad... didn't sign up for this.

584
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:33,649
<i>[dank of a untens 'm a pan]</i>

585
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,567
Don't you ever say that again.

586
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,195
Do you understand?

587
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,531
Look at me.

588
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,701
[RUTH] You didn't do this.

589
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:47,329
And nothing in the world
could have prevented it.

590
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:51,251
And no one... is standing in
the way of you getting better.

591
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,963
But what if we lose all our money?

592
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,638
Listen to me. We are working on you.

593
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:08,601
And if we have to go back to Dr.
Seuss, and training wheels,

594
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:12,563
and doing it all by ourselves...

595
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,691
that's what we're going to do.

596
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:18,402
[RUTH] And that's the last
"sorry" I wanna hear on it.

597
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,571
You got that?

598
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,323
Yes ma'am.

599
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,996
Okay. Let's do it again.

Keep it moving!

[COACH WILSON] Stay low now... stay low.

Alright... push it push it push it!

Stay low. Stay low!

Hey Hoov... nice patch!

Hey guys. What's up Scoot?

610

[COACH WILSON] Alright boys... water up.

611
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,077
Coach.

612
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,497
[COACH WILSON] Yeah.

613
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,082
I... just came to say...
it may take awhile,

614
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,460
but I want back on this team.

615
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:19,130
Oh... you were never off the team son.

'Til you get your game back on...

how about doing some coaching?

Sir?

619
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:28,515
Well I mean I can't see
everything out there.

620
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:33,686
Tomorrow at three... Coach Elliott.
See you there.

621
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:35,562
[HOOVEY] Yes sir!

622
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,564
[COACH WILSON] Oh... and HOOV...

it's picture day. Your
uniform will be in your locker.

00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:56,500
[COACH WILSON] Wait a minute.

625
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:59,087
Hoovey... Come on over here.

00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:06,844
[PHOTOGRAPHER] Hey thirty-three,

627
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,346
could you take off your glasses?

[horses neigh]

629
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,990
[RUTH] Doctor... what's the diagnosis?

630
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:30,118
We need a new septic tank.

631
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,246
How much does that cost?

632
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:37,333
More than we have, but
what's new about that?

633
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,544
How's your day look?

634
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:43,630
I've got some intellectually
stimulating brush and stump

00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,049
removal over at the Long's farm.

636
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,051
Hundred bucks as long as my back holds out,

637
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,470
and uh... them I'm going
to deliver me some pizzas,

638
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:54,558
and then uh... I'm going to help
Fred Hollander clean the bank.

639
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,059
And then you're back on shift.

640
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,561
[JEFF] Living the dream baby.

641
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,355
Living the dream.

642
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:04,193
It's still my dream. And
you're still my Superman.

643
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,238
Can we sell the place?

644
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,991
Not for what we owe them.

645
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,452
Then I have to go back to work.

646
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:16,204
Where? Half this town is looking for a job.

647
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,040
Well I can deliver pizzas.

648
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:20,667
I can... mow lawns and...

649
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,128
Don't worry baby, I got this.

650
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,212
Nothings more important than what you're

651
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,714
doing here right now any way, so...

652
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:27,382
What am I doing?

00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,218
Holding us together.

654
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:32,721
I gotta go.

<i>No no!</i>

663
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,749
To the left... the ball has to
go to the center post first.

00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,667
He wasn't there!

665
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:03,836
Yet. You gotta let him set up!

666
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:06,839
[COACH WILSON] Alright...
Let's do it again!

667

[whistle]

668
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:20,978

[COACH WILSON] Yeah?

[HOOVEY] Can I?

671
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:25,274
Come on.

672
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:32,406
It's like a wheel...
that turns to the left.

673
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:35,826
If you got to one side
like that, it's lopsided.

674
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,745
You'll get trapped by the
double team every single time.

675
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,623
What are you talking about?

676
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:44,710
You've got a hole at the top of the key.

677
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:48,046
Wait for the first screen... then go left.

678
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:51,009
Yeah... yeah sure thing coach.

00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,386
Donovan.

680
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,973
He's absolutely right.

681
00:41:57,557 --> 00:41:59,349
But that's not how we did it at my school.

682
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,476
Well that's the way we do it here.

683
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:02,686
Maybe you should think about that while

684
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,396
you run twenty laps for us!

685
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:06,024
NOW!

686
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,545
[MIKE] The equity you have
in your farm doesn't even

687
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:32,007
come close to what you
owe in medical bills.

688
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,051
They just keep coming.

689
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:35,552
We're working it out...

690
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,679
It's just temporary.

691
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,640
[RUTH] We just need a bridge loan.

692
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,436
Mike you know us. We're lifers around here.

693
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,812
There's nothing you can do?

694
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:49,776
Your farm is mortgaged to the hilt.
Your savings is gone.

695
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,527
You've maxed out your consumer credit.

696
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:55,947
This is an astronomical sum of
money for middle level salary.

697
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:59,535
Honestly... no.

698
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,782
[JEFF] I guess it's been
a little while right?

699
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,660
[HOOVEY] Yeah.

700
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:44,412
[HOOVEY] It's about time.

701
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,872
[JEFF] Just keep your eyes
focused straight ahead,

702
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,835

She knows the way.

[HOOVEY] Hey dad...

705
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,800
What did you want to be
when you were my age?

706
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:58,678
[JEFF] Married to your mom.

707
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,555
Come on.

708
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,890
I did... I wanted to be
quarterback of the Bears,

709
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,853
and married to your mom and
own a sixty foot bass boat.

710
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,854
[JEFF] You know your mom and me are proud

711
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:11,606
that you decided to help
the team out by coaching.

712
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,900
[HOOVEY] Yeah... but I can't
wait to get out there

713
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,819
and start playing again Dad.

714
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,363
[JEFF] Well...

715
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:22,368
The truth is, you can't
play basketball anymore.

716
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,954
One good shot to the head could kill you.

717
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,456
That's official?

718
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,834
Yeah.

719
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:34,505
[HOOVEY] And you're just now...
telling me because...

720
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:41,012
{music}

721
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:44,909
How ya doing', Coach?

722
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,834
I... don't think I can do this anymore.

723
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:58,046
It's killing me.

724
00:45:58,047 --> 00:46:00,548
Why is this happening, Coach?

725
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,426
What did I do wrong?

726
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:09,976
[COACH WILSON] So, uh... the
good Lord was having a talk with

727
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:13,561
the Devil one day.

728
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,897
Bragging on his man Job.

729
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,775
"See how he loves me? Serves me?"

730
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,735
"Well," said the Devil. "Why wouldn't he?

731
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,779
You give him everything. [scoffs]

732
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:26,742
Money, power... land, children.

733
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,578
Let me take it away from him, and watch him

734
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,539
curse you to your face."

735
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,500
And God said, "Oh, okay."

736
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:38,962
So the Devil does. He takes everything.

737
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:43,049
Leaves old Job with nothing,
sitting in the dirt,

738
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,759
covered with boils.

739
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,469
[chuckles]

740
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,557
Finally old Job had had enough.

741
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:52,435
What do you reckon he said?

742
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:57,898
"It was... all His to begin with."

743
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,570
He didn't do anything wrong.

744
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:05,614
Neither did you.

745
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:12,621
[horse snorts]

746
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:21,672
[horse snorts]

747
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:26,051
[metal chain clanks, fence creaks open]

748
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:27,720
Woah.

749
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,933
[fence clangs shut]

750
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:49,407
[JEN] I don't think I'm gonna
eat again until Friday.

751
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:53,078
<i>[JEFF] Good. That?“ save us a grocery run.</i>

752
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:55,498
[JEN] This is a tough one... isn't it?

753
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,541
[JEFF] What do you mean?

754
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,378
Hello? I'm eighteen...

755
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:03,046
not eight.

756
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:04,715
I know what's going on.

757
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:08,885
Your mother and I are so proud of you, hun.

758
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,054
You're a beautiful...?

759
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:12,889
Thanks.

760
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,350
You're changing the subject.

761
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:17,602
All right, that's it...

762
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:18,937
I'm cutting you out of the will.

763
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:20,397
[laughs]

764
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:22,732
You'll get nothing and like it.
The way it's gonna have to be.

765
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,360
[laughs]

766
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:27,404
You remember when I used to get scared

767
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,864
and you'd always come in
and ask the same question,

768
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,408
"What's the first thing the angel says when

769
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:32,409
he shows up in the Bible?"

770
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,661
"Don't be afraid."

771
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:38,039
Well, we were never afraid before.

772
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,707
How did you get so wise?

773
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:40,542
From Mom. From Mom, yes...

774
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:42,043
[shocked gasp] Hurting feelings.

775
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,671
Awwww.

776
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:46,257
Thanks for the day, honey.

777
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,926
Let's go.

778
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:53,012
[JEN] Dad... Dad? The car's way over there.

779
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,932
[JEFF] Mine is. This one's yours.

780
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:59,394
Wait... but... how would...?

781
00:48:59,395 --> 00:49:00,895
Dad, no WHY!

782
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:01,729
[JEN squeals] Dad!

783
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:02,814
[JEFF chuckles]

784
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:05,900
[JEFF] Old Man Long traded me
for some stump pulling, so...

785
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,527
This is my dad everybody and

786
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:08,903
I love him!

787
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,572
I love you!

788
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:11,990
Can we go? Can we go? Oh!

789
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:12,866
[JEFF] Careful!

790
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,617
She's old, but she runs.

791
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:17,078
[JEN gasps]

792
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,832
Get outta town! Let's do this.

793
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:22,501
[JEFF] Irving Zeldoff, ever heard of him?

794
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,630
Ummm... not ringing a bell.

795
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:30,383
Tightrope walker, about
a hundred years ago.

796
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:33,595
He'd do these crazy stunts,
walk between skyscrapers,

797
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:34,846
bridges...

798
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:37,433
So one day old' Irv decides to go big.

799
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:41,895
Stretches a line across Niagara Falls.

800
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:44,063
Now, nobody had ever tried that before

801
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,316
so a huge crowd gathers.

802
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:48,818
Irving brings a wheelbarrow

803
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,111
and he asks the crowd,

804
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:52,322
"How many of you believe I
can walk across this rope

805
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:54,157
pushing this wheelbarrow?"

806
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:55,408
Whole crowd shouts,

807
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:58,786
"We believe! We believe!"

808
00:49:58,787 --> 00:49:59,871
Then he asks,

809
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:03,249
"Who will get in that
wheelbarrow and go with me?"

810
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,918
Crickets.

811
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:07,253
Coulda' heard a pin drop.

812
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:10,924
Believing he could do it... that was easy.
They'd seen it.

813
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:12,884
Getting into that wheelbarrow and

814
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:14,719
letting somebody else do the walking

815
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,013
with no net under...

816
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,724
That's faith.

817
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:27,190
I have f-f-faith, Dad.

818
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:30,235
It's not you that needs to
get in that wheelbarrow...

819
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:31,654
It's me.

820
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,741
Stand up.

821
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,243
Get that eye patch off.

822
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:40,246
You're a point guard, not a pirate.

823
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:48,878
Now bad things happen, but, uh...

824
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,881
what makes a man is
what he does with it.

825
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,717
[JEFF] Let's do this like old' Irv...

826
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,387
one step at a time.

827
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:03,017
[HOOVEY] Whoa. Oh...

828
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,061
[JEFF] I gotcha.

829
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:07,105
That's one.

830
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:08,732
Let's try again.

831
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:19,951
It's clear.

832
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:20,785
[RUTH cries]

833
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,161

896
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,948

[HOOVEY laughs]

898
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:29,827

Think it looks better on me, huh?

908
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:14,036
Come on. Let's try again.

909
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,247
If you miss a layup, that's ten push-ups.

910
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:18,332
No, no... if you miss a layup

911
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,750
it's fifteen push ups.

912
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:23,212
Alright come on gentlemen,
keep it going. Right.

Yeah.

917
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:32,138
[HOOVEY] If there's any spots
left, I'd like to try for one.

918
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:34,265
[COACH WILSON] You missed the "We" speech.

919
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:35,726
I know it by heart, Coach.

920
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,353

00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,400
How hard can I go?

00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,028
Go hard, you'll need to.

Scout from I.U. He's, uh...
He's looking at Donovan.

933
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:11,761

now and gotten about

It's not personal, man. This is business.

959
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,362
Agreed.

I don't deserve to be here,

and I'm glad you're all right...

This is my shot.

cuz those others can't hack point.

And we're out a shooter.

01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:55,401
We can't win like that.

1003
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:58,738
I mean do you even know who
was in the stands today?

1004
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,783
I ticket outta this hick town,

stop me from that.

What are you doing here anyway, man?

1007
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:13,919
You could play anywhere. Why
would you pick this hick town?

1008
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,881
I didn't pick it.

1009
01:01:16,882 --> 01:01:18,216

[DONOVAN] No.

But I didn't stop it, either.

1015

We're all a time bomb, Donovan...

1016
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:57,380
We don't get final say in how it goes.

1017
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:02,801
I hear what you're saying, but

1018
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:06,305
maybe I wanna shot myself.

1019
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:09,893
Maybe I want some guy from a
college looking at me, too.

1020
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:16,815
I'll be here tomorrow, man.

1021

1028
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,827
[RICH] Elliot, it's your wife.

Hey hun, what's up?

1031
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:20,004
Can you come home?

1032
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:21,840
It's back.

1033
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:31,182
[DOCTOR KATTNER] We've detected
a residual piece of tumor.

1034
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:35,311
It could be a small piece
I missed in surgery,

1035
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:37,062
that's common,

1036
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:40,149
but it could also be new growth.

1037
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:43,235
Are you having any dizziness or headaches?

1038
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:46,405
No, sir. I'm good.

1039
01:03:46,406 --> 01:03:48,949
[JEFF] To tell you the truth, Doctor...

1040
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:51,327
Hoove's been playing basketball again.

1041
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:52,911
Hmm.

1042
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:55,080
I see.

1043
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:56,958
Lean forward for me.

1044
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:04,423
Ok. It's, uh, more solid
than I thought it would be

1045
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:07,426
but scar tissue is not bone

1046
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:09,887
so I wouldn't call it a
hundred percent safe.

1047
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:12,348
So are you saying he can't play basketball?

1048
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:15,143
I can't tell you what to
do, I can only recommend.

1049
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,729
So recommend.

1050
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:21,357
Honestly, I never thought we'd
be having this conversation

1051
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:22,900
in the first place,

1052
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:24,943
the fact is, we have to
watch this closely...

1053
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,945
[RUTH] So what's a mother to do?

1054
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:30,949
Take a chance on something that
might or might not happen?

1055
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,202
[JEFF] Prayers.

1056
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:35,120
[sigh]

1057
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:38,792
Father, we thank you for
all that you... um...

1058
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:41,211
do.

1059
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,005
Amen.

1060
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:47,050
[RUTH] Or protect your child?

1061
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:53,056
And watch his spirit truly begin to die.

1062
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:58,894
[JEFF] Ruth, the biopsy
came back negative and

1063
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:02,649
this doctor's never gonna say
it's okay to play basketball...

1064
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:06,402
[RUTH] That's not true, that's not true.
That's not true.

1065
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:10,364
He said that it will eventually harden

1066
01:05:10,365 --> 01:05:13,200
so that he could do some physical activity

1067
01:05:13,201 --> 01:05:14,910
but it's gonna be a while.

1068
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,912
He can't go right back to
a basketball season...

1069
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,414
[JEFF] When is that gonna be?

1070
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:20,249
When is that gonna be? When it's all over?

1071
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,375
[RUTH] ...I don't... what?

1072
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:22,918
[JEFF] When he's twenty-eight
years old and he doesn't

1073
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:23,752
have a shot anymore?

1074
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,337
[RUTH] He's twenty-eight years
old, wouldn't that be great?

1075
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:26,881
Wouldn't that be great?

1076
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:40,894
We lost both of the foals.

1077
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:43,272
Miscarried.

1078
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:44,440
<i>No.</i>

1079
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:46,901
Yeah, both. What are the chances of that?

1080
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:51,947
This whole year, we almost lose Hoovey...

1081
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,323
we're gonna lose the
place... we both know it,

1082
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:56,243
it's just a matter of time...

1083
01:05:56,244 --> 01:05:58,245
I lose two tractors, a septic tank,

1084
01:05:58,246 --> 01:06:00,122
freezer goes out with half a cow in it...

1085
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:01,915
That's a grand right there...

1086
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:04,793
And that two baby foals stillborn...

1087
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,003
That's five grand gone bye bye.

1088
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:09,047
It's mathematically impossible, Ruth.

1089
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:11,217
Mathematically impossible.

1090
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:15,179
I've played by the rules the whole way.

1091
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,263
I've done everything right

1092
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:17,723
and this is what I've got to show for it,

1093
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:20,225
just watch everything slip away?

1094
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:21,351
<i>No.</i>

1095
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:23,104
Where did I screw up, Ruth?

1096
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,400
Where did I choke?

1097
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:30,361
Tell me.

1098
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:32,780
Tell me.

1099
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:35,282
You gotta tell me.

1100
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:37,117
Cuz I need to know.

1101
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:41,121
You didn't choke anything, Elliot.

1102
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:43,916
They can take all of this.

1103
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:46,418
I don't care. It's just...

1104
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:49,713
stuff.

1105
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:51,174
Our family?

1106
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:56,094
That is the only dream we ever had.

1107
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:58,764
It was the only thing you
and I never had that we

1108
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:00,933
cried and we prayed for

1109
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:03,019
every night.

1110
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:07,356
They can't take that.

1111
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:10,068
I will not let them.

1112
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:14,363
I just know that there has to be a reason.

1113
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:16,031
There has to be a reason,

1114
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:20,118
and I just want God to tell me what it is.

1115

Last one standing, huh?

1128
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,701
Thank you, girl.

1129
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,163
Thank you.

[horse snorts]

1131
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,337
I've got something to say.

1132
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:58,467
Mr. Brain Tumor might be
the thing that kills me

1133
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:01,137
or, maybe, it just goes away.

1134
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:05,475
But I can't control it either way, can I?

1135
01:09:07,352 --> 01:09:09,728
What do you always say, Dad?

1136
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:12,272
It's not what happens to you,

1137
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:13,691
it's what you do with it.

1138
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:18,153
And what do you say, Mom?

1139
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:22,116
If a dream is good... and
true... it came from God.

1140
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:28,414
Maybe... that's what this is all about.

1141
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:33,752
I know you're scared, Mom.

1142
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:35,712
I am, too.

1143
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:38,465
A little bit... but...

1144
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:41,635
I wanna try again.

1145
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:44,347
And I think God wants that, too.

1146
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:50,645
But... I won't go against you.

1147
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:04,242
I've been thinking a lot about this.

1148
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:10,623
It's your life.

1149
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:13,459
It's your dream.

1150
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,754
And you have to live both.

1152
01:10:28,516 --> 01:10:29,808
[COACH WILSON] All right now, listen.

1153
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:33,771
We play with class, dignity, and respect

1154
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:39,484
to honor our families and our teammates

1155
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:43,448
with our commitment to one another.

1156
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:46,783
To honor our Father

1157
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:50,747
by taking our gifts and hammering them

1158
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:53,749
into a skill.

1159
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:56,543
And then we pour it on.

1160
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:59,796
We pour it on like champions

1161
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:02,215
leaving nothing on that court.

1162
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:04,260

In the name of the Father,
who gives us life,

01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,662
and the Son, who gives us eternal life,

1169
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:36,625
and the Holy Spirit from
which all life flows...

1170
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:39,169
We surrender all.

1171
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:41,546
And we give all.

long-time rival Morgan High,

1189
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:44,651
but the real story here
is the amazing comeback

01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:47,445
of point guard Eric "Hoovey" Elliot,

1191
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:51,367

[ANNOUNCER] We are
underway, basketball fans.

who joins the Olmpia Spartans
tonight for their most crucial

1198
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:33,451
game of the season.

spots Donovan Oaks on the break.

01:13:45,296 --> 01:13:48,090
And booyah! The Spartans are on the board!

1202
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:51,147
[DONOVAN] Great pass, man. Keep it coming!

With the Cobra's coming into
tonight's game undefeated,

a lot of people thought this
was gonna be a blow out,

1217
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:40,059
but so far these Olympia
Spartans look competitive.

1218
01:14:42,353 --> 01:14:44,771
Whoa! Derek Jones turns
up the heat on Elliot.

1219
01:14:44,772 --> 01:14:46,648
Come on, ref, way to watch it!

Fasten your seatbelts,
Ladies and Gentlemen.

1221
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:52,697

And Hoovey hits a three-pointer!

1227
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,769
The game is tied! Ladies and Gentlemen,

1228
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:27,314
we have the makings of a
championship game here.

1229
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:32,569
Oh! And Scooter Nealand's
pass goes right into

1230
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:33,653
the Cobra's hands

1231
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:36,157
and Jones is in for an easy dunk.

1232
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:41,746
And Elliot for three.

1233
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:45,123
Wilson over Wright for two.

1234
01:15:45,124 --> 01:15:46,709
This game is neck and neck.

1235
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:50,628
Pass from Elliot...

1236
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:52,797

01:16:05,144 --> 01:16:07,312
Scooter! Wake up out there!

1242
01:16:07,313 --> 01:16:08,313
You have to stop him.

1243
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:09,147
I can't!

1244
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:10,148
I believe you can.

1245
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:12,817
Olympia's Scooter Nealand is
struggling mightily against

1246

01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:24,328
"[JEFF] Hoovey! Hoovey!

1428
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:26,747
You with me, son?

1429
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:32,544
Hoove!

1430
01:25:36,048 --> 01:25:37,424
Are you with me, boy?

1431
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:41,762
[voice breaks] Hoove, come on.

1432
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:47,642
Did you see that left move, big boy?

1433
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:49,269
Yeah I saw it, Pinto.

1434
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:54,774
[CROWD cheers]

1435
01:25:54,775 --> 01:25:56,234
[HOOVEY] I'm okay, Mom.

1436
01:26:09,206 --> 01:26:10,790
Did go in, didn't it?

1437
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:12,124
Nothing but net.

1438
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:14,251
That was my shot, too.

1439
01:26:14,252 --> 01:26:16,629
[REF] If you think they can't
shoot, you can use a player

1440
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:18,590
from the bench, Coach. Not from the floor.

1441
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:23,636
[HOOVEY] Coach.

1442
01:26:23,637 --> 01:26:25,471
This is my shot.

1443
01:26:25,472 --> 01:26:26,722
<i>Mine.</i>

1444
01:26:26,723 --> 01:26:29,266
Okay then...

1445
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:31,435
drain it.

1446
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:33,813
[whistle]

1447
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:36,148
Were you really gonna hit that guy?

1448
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:37,650
I still might.

1449
01:26:37,651 --> 01:26:39,151
Don't bother.

1450
01:26:39,152 --> 01:26:40,612
I'm finishing this right now.

1451
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:03,718
[RUTH] You all shoulda' been
there when I brought him home

1452
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:05,511
some helmets to try out.

1453
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:06,303
[laughs]

1454
01:27:06,304 --> 01:27:08,347
You see, the thing is...

1455
01:27:08,348 --> 01:27:10,474
eventually...

1456
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:14,438
we all just have to let go
and get in that wheelbarrow.

1457
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:18,483
Or we'll never get to the other side.

1458
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:23,529
Because believing...

1459
01:27:23,530 --> 01:27:25,490
makes it possible.

1460
01:27:26,742 --> 01:27:29,326
Faith...

1461
01:27:29,327 --> 01:27:31,204
makes it real.

1462
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:42,048
[CROWD cheers]

1463
01:28:40,774 --> 01:28:44,736
{music}

1464
01:29:17,602 --> 01:29:19,144
[ANNOUNCER 2] Ladies and Gentlemen,

1465
01:29:19,145 --> 01:29:21,773
the entire Elliot family.

1466
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:08,277
I was having headaches all the time

1467
01:30:08,278 --> 01:30:09,612
and, uh, getting sick,

1468
01:30:09,613 --> 01:30:11,655
and we thought it was
just a sinus infection.

1469
01:30:11,656 --> 01:30:15,117
But we found out that it
was, uh, a brain tumor

1470
01:30:15,118 --> 01:30:16,160
the size of an orange.

1471
01:30:16,161 --> 01:30:18,370
Surgery was performed to remove the tumor

1472
01:30:18,371 --> 01:30:20,247
from Eric's brain.

1473
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:21,582
But a new challenge would arise for Eric

1474
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:23,668
after the surgery.
