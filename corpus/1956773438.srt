00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,859
Did you see Shark Week,
when it was on TV, the cable thing?

167
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,779
They're talking about sharks,
telling you everything about sharks.

168
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,947
When a sharks stops
swimming, they drown.

169
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:06,451
Okay? l gonna keep it moving,
Dave. l'm gonna keep it moving.

170
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,703
That's what l'm
trying to tell you.

171
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,540
I need you to sign
one more thing.

172
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,293
Nah, man, give it to Gary.

173
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,256
All right, dude.

174
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,717
[muffled hip-hop music
coming from car]

175
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,230
What up, boy?

176
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,148
What's good, baby?

177
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,691
Ain't nothin'.

178
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,276
We gotta get that
demo from Tyrone.

179
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,903
Yeah, he want that bread though.

180
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,112
How much you talking?

181
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,239
$ 1,500.

182
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,907
1,500?

183
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,617
Jay, you gotta
talk him down, man.

184
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:50,078
I mean, l can do it,
ain't nothing.

185
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,248
Nah, serious, man, because you know l
got that meeting with A-Maze and Gary.

186
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,667
Jay, this is serious, man.

187
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:59,003
I know it's serious. Come on. What you
gonna do? You gonna do the same thing?

188
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,506
Bro, we gotta go
to work. We late.

189
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,593
Come on, man.
Trippin', man. Shit.

190
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,106
Good morning,
good morning, good morning.

191
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,782
Good morning. Welcome to
Lalo's. May l take your order, please?

192
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,035
Yeah. l'd like a coffee,
a morning bacon sandwich,

193
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,496
and can l get a side

194
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,957
Uh, right. Um,

195
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,501
Bacon sandwich with cheese.

196
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,136
How you doing, sir?
That'll be two-fifty.

197
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:07,071
Thank you, sir.

198
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,657
And enjoy your
green potato salad.

199
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,036
(photographer) Sexy in the eyes. A-Maze,
right in the camera.

200
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,664
Girls. Sexy, sexy.
Turn your shoulders in.

201
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,751
Shoulders into me. Arching
the backs. Asses out. Asses out.

202
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:23,254
Girls, relax. Relax. A little more,
get into each other.

203
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,506
No, get him to loosen up,
not the girls.

204
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,675
Hey, l've tried everything
except a cattle prod.

205
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,260
Can you get this going, dude?

206
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,825
A-Maze, relax. These
are your bitches.

207
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,639
I'm trying, man l get tired.

208
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,515
Come on, you're the king
of the hood, man.

209
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,351
I'm shuffling my feet
'cause they hurt.

210
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,144
Stay with me.

211
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,104
I've been posing
for a long time. l'm hot.

212
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,856
I know.

213
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,859
All right. Let's take
ten. Let's take ten.

214
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,446
You look great.

215
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,032
Oh, no, no, no, nah,
l need you to go on over there.

216
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,660
You'd fit right in there.

217
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:58,039
One shot. Gary, don't you wanna see her in...
You wanna see her in one of those numbers.

218
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,124
Stop bullshitting. You
wanna see it. Thank you.

219
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,168
Okay, yes.

220
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,382
(Joannie) Hey boys.
How're you doing?

221
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,304
Let me see what you doing.

222
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,764
Excuse you.

223
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,432
Give me this.

224
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,938
Okay, you know what? You really
shouldn't be reading my messages.

225
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,440
It's only journalists
looking for a statement.

226
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,902
Well, the problem is that statement
comes out, and it stirs up this pot

227
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,947
with this beef,
and it fucks me up.

228
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:34,283
No, because all of it can play our way,
okay?

229
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,829
50 Cent got huge sales
off his beef with Jarule.

230
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,915
Tupac, Biggie,
all of it parlayed into record sales.

231
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,834
That's the angle
l'm working with.

232
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:46,254
Okay, Ja Rule, first
of all is the dude's name.

233
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:51,134
And your first mistake is,
50 Cent took nine bullet holes.

234
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,511
Tupac and Biggie? Dead.

235
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:56,597
I can't remember the last time
that l heard about a publicist

236
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,517
lying face-down in the gutter.

237
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:03,479
I've already prepared a
press release. Take a look.

238
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:10,611
All right. So it says that B-Bone
is at fault. And then what?

239
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:14,115
And then the press gets hungry
and they start scavenging around.

240
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,701
And l've already sent it out.

241
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:20,705
You know, sometimes l think l shouldn't be
watching my back for these hood mo'fuckers.

242
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,207
Really it's you, Joanie,

243
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,627
and people like you
that scare me more.

244
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:30,339
It's good that l scare you.
It'll keep you on your toes.

245
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,884
A-Maze! We're back on the clock. Let's go,
man.

246
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,678
Okay, go get 'em, tiger!

247
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,890
Thank you, sir.

248
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,983
That'll be 22 .50.

249
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,735
Yeah, fool.

250
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,029
L'll see you on the other side.

251
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:56,574
You already know we
do to that, too. Ha-ha.

252
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,163
What was that all about?

253
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,998
I don't know.

254
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,714
Jay. Fuckin' Roman's
at the window, dog.

255
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,341
Who?

256
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,675
Roman.

257
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,095
Fuck.

258
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,098
(Bowman) You guys got
five minutes. Don't push it.

259
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,183
What up, Raff?

260
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:26,187
What up, bro?
That's right.

261
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,898
There you go, there.

262
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,528
Aw, man.
You know what?

263
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,614
We gonna have to change
our business location, man.

264
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:40,368
I can't take this motherfucker
rolling up on us like that.

265
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,286
It's his thing.
He be eyeing.

266
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,622
He ain't gunning for you.
He ain't got no reason to.

267
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,208
He ain't got to have no
reason to get at you, you know.

268
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,586
That's just what he do. He
got killing in his blood, bro.

269
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,798
You talking all superstitious.
Like he the devil or somethin'.

270
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:57,635
He ain't the devil,
but l just don't wanna be on his bad side.

271
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,471
You know what l'm saying?
The object of his attention.

272
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,640
Yeah, man. Yo,
you spoke with Tyrone, right?

273
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,309
And what he said that we still
owe him some money for that demo?

274
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,229
I mean, yeah, that what he said.
But l can always talk him down.

275
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,667
Nah. Don't even talk him down.
Let me call him and talk to him.

276
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,609
I want you to call Gary up
and act like my manager.

277
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,654
Manager? You mean
your producer?

278
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,781
Producer, whatever you wanna do.

279
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,951
Just make sure it sound real
professional and l'll call Tyrone.

280
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,744
Yeah, let's do it.

281
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:28,749
Gary.

282
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,002
Tyrone. Wassup, man?

283
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,628
Yeah. This is
Young Eastie.

284
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,089
This is Jay.
Young Eastie's producer.

285
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,236
Yeah, you know, l'm trying to connect
with you to come pick that demo up, man.

286
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,012
I know we short on cash,
l know that. But we need it right now

287
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,973
and l'll get the cash to you later on. No,

288
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,517
Yeah, we know where Del
South Records at. Course we do.

00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,519
But l kinda really

00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,521
We gonna be there.
Yeah, one hundred.

291
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,523
All right man, yeah.

292
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,026
Shit.

293
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:58,946
Can you believe this motherfucker

294
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:03,034
Man, fuck that shit,

295
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,494
Del South records,

296
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,580

I swear to God. You now your
boy got it. What you gonna do?

298
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,378
Let's check the bank account. That's
what we gotta do. How much you got?

299
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,131
Going into pockets now.

300
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,675
I got one-forty.
What you got?

301
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,928
One-forty? l got a
little something like that.

302
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,347
That look like more
than enough right there.

303
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:27,516
Nah, this ain't enough. Look, this
right here is the business account, right?

304
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:31,812
This' like $ 1,600. And this right here's
the personal checking account. lt's 850.

305
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,481
We got a business account?

306
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,733
Yeah.

307
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,819
Shit, look like we gonna have to
go into the business account, dude.

308
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,906
Nah, we can't touch that. l got that
from Green. He gave us the package,

309
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,076
that granddaddy cush. And l
ain't trying to fuck up that connect.

310
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,579
So, l don't wanna dip into this money. So,
you know what? Let me get that right there.

311
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,123
Let me get that money. We
gotta get another hustle on,

312
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,335
but here's what l need you to do

313
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:59,882
Two minutes. Just trust me. You're gonna
find out what we're gonna do right now.

314
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,426
(Bowman) l hired
you 'cause l like you.

315
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,429
But you can't just come
in any time you want to.

316
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,724
Why do black people
think 9:00 is 1 1:00?

317
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,687
You've been late everyday this week.
And you're gonna have to wear a hairnet.

318
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:16,232
I can't have weave hairs in
the food. l'm just telling you.

319
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:19,443
You don't wanna wear a hairnet,
you're gonna have to get fired.

320
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:23,698
All your little fat ass friends coming here
eatin' for free, that ain't gonna happen.

321
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,117
And you taking advantage of it.

322
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:29,412
Excuse me? Damn, are you serious?
This what happened right now?

323
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,872
What's up with you, young fella?

324
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:35,042
'Scuse me. Uh, you know
my little sister, Tasha.

325
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,754
She ate some peanuts and now all of
the sudden her whole neck is swollen up.

326
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,383
Look, you got a family emergency. Go
ahead take care of it. Family come first.

327
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:46,470
Bowman, thank you so much. This is a huge
favor. l promise you l will fill in the hours.

328
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,389
Just get going.
Handle your business.

329
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,225
Okay, l'm available.

330
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:55,396
Back to you, young lady. l was hoping this
evening we could probably catch dinner.

331
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,275
I'm just saying. l'm giving you more
than l'm giving the rest of these girls.

332
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:03,571
I'm just saying. All right,
l'm done. You can go.

333
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,118
I like that ass.

334
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:13,998
Hey, y'all better get the fuck out the
way before we end up hittin' one of y'all.

335
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:20,296
(Ro-Bo) Yo,
y'all about to fall back. Come on.

336
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:27,011
What happened to that
receptionist last time we was here?

337
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:30,806
(Gary) Now they got my man up
front. That isn't very welcoming.

338
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,267
Fucking place looks
like it's shrinking.

339
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:37,188
Posters. Yeah, that's cool.
I've got better posters than that.

340
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,190
I look tired in
that motherfucker.

341
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,525
(Gary)
Platinum plaques, baby.

342
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,778
(Ro-Bo) Still room
for a couple more.

343
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:51,619
Philip. lt's my man. l ain't
seen you in a minute man.

344
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,455
Can l get you
gentlemen anything?

345
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,499
Nah, we're good.

346
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,294
L'll take one of these. Yeah.
So what's up? Where Clay at?

347
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,880
Clay's not gonna be here today.

348
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:05,966
What you mean Clay not here today,
man? You knew l was coming to see him.

349
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,303
I got the email that said that you and
Clay were gonna be here at the meeting.

350
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,639
You all know how
things can get for Clay.

351
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,535
Love that new track, by the way.
We've been playing it 9:00 AM, non-stop.

352
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,310
Yeah, that's cool.
Don't wear it out.

353
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,039
I think we should lead
off the album with that.

354
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,481
I think l should
finish my album.

355
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,461
That's something we need to talk about.
Clay wants to move the release date up.

356
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,778
That's bullshit.
Hell, no.

357
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:28,262
Listen, we're thinking we can
leak a track onto the lnternet.

358
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:31,075
Perhaps tie it in with a video
piece that looks sort of homemade

359
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,744
like it was shot on
a cell phone or something.

360
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:37,748
That way it can be downloaded and then all
over the place so that nobody buys the album.

361
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,252
It won't get downloaded all over the place.
The album will be released weeks later.

362
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,838
The l nternet's the swap
meet of the world, man.

363
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:47,235
We can send a track out the next couple of
weeks and get some traction on the album.

364
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,510
Wait a minute and you
listen to this, dude.

365
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,513
Since you didn't hear me the first
time real good, it ain't done, yet!

366
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,349
It can be done.

367
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,936
I'm in the studio right now! l'ma talk
louder so Dr. Phil over here can hear me!

368
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,272
It ain't done, yet!

369
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:04,233
It can be done. l hear the
tracks are ready to master.

370
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,610
I ain't making no bootleg shit though,
dude.

371
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,363
Of course. l know that. But
it's really time to move, A-Maze.

372
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,533
You don't understand. Yo,
you make music? You make music?

373
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:15,369
Nah, you don't, you don't.
You work for Clay, nigger.

374
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,705
I wanna see Clay.
Where the fuck is Clay at?

375
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:20,332
Clay's right here.

376
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:26,130
Yo, what's up with my release date, man? He's
telling me shit l don't want to hear, man.

377
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,632
(Clay) Let me talk
to him for a minute.

378
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:34,472
It's cool man. Let us holla.
I'm right behind you all.

379
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,765
(Gary) Hey, Phil,
Phil. Hold on for a second.

380
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:40,060
Y'all pull the car
around out front, all right?

381
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,980
Can l talk to you for a second?

382
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,316
What the fuck is this all about?

383
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,152
Well, because it's you,

384
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:52,281
l'm gonna act like you didn't just
use the word fuck in my presence.

385
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:57,578
And that's just
gonna give you arthritis.

386
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:03,083
So, you wanna know what
the fuck this is all about?

387
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,169
Yeah, l mean, l don't
really get called

388
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,421
to be in your presence
all that much.

389
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:11,258
Yeah, we should spend more time
together. And you do need my advice.

390
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,803
Yeah, but l still got a problem
with changing my release date.

391
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,848
To be honest, you're
the problem right now.

392
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:21,852
I mean, the last album,
it didn't even go gold.

393
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,855
And we gotta to make something
happen in the market place.

394
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,484
I see. So you talking about
dropping me from the label?

395
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:30,569
Would l do that
to an old friend?

396
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,447
I'm saying 'cause l'm ready to go. Drop me,
l'm ready to go.

397
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,617
L'll just take my masters with me
and go make my own shit happen.

398
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:40,704
While you're at it, why don't you just pull
a Tina Turner and ask to keep my last name?

399
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,499
I know you're busy and everything,
but when you get a second,

400
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,627
l just wanna talk to you about the
label me and Maze are putting together.

401
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,004
You got my number?

402
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:52,007
Yeah, yeah, l've got your number,
but what l really wanna do is,

403
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:56,220
l wanna get you the CD of this new kid that
we're signing first. He's fresh. Fresh!

404
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,889
Can't wait to
hear it. Call me.

405
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,642
L'll call you.
It's fresh.

406
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,019
Why release now?

407
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:08,148
Because you generated a lot of heat
last night. And we can capitalize on it.

408
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:13,571
That's all well and good, but l'm not
finished with the album, yet. lt's not ready.

409
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,156
I think you might just be
worrying a little too much.

410
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:19,326
Somebody around this motherfucker
gotta worry about something.

411
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,495
All the pressure
is really on me.

412
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:25,040
From what l heard, the album is fire,
man. Back to the old you.

413
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:29,420
Listen, remember l told you,
l'm like Don King.

414
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,756
I can get you with any
and everybody in the ring.

415
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:37,803
But it's up to you to win the
fight. Let me just do my job.

416
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:45,519
The meeting is over, man.
This piece of shit.

417
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,780
Tyrone.

418
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,786
Brought my money?

419
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,955
Money? What you
talking about? For what?

420
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,541
We already paid for the
session. l just need a demo.

421
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,919
I got nothin' to say to you. l had to mix
and master that shit. That shit's extra.

422
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:13,172
No, Jay mixed it
and mastered it.

423
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:16,133
Pushing sliders doesn't
constitute mixing a track, okay?

424
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,802
He had me fix his
mixes after you left.

425
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,305
Whoa, wait, wait,
listen, listen, listen.

426
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:25,142
Okay, we got a meeting today.
And l mean it, it is huge.

427
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,895
You see the kind of cats l'm
rolling with right now, right?

428
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:32,274
This is your chance to be part of the dream.
This is serious. l mean, shit is gonna happen.

429
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,693
I get a chance to be
part of the dream?

430
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:38,739
This is what l'll do. l'm gonna take
your dream and l'm gonna take my 1,500.

431
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:42,785
How 'bout that? When you get the money,
you come holla at me.

432
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:46,580
It's business. Nothing
personal, bro. A'ight?

433
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,582
All right.

434
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,271
(Keisha) Coming.
L'll be right there.

435
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:23,283
[romantic music]

436
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,745
Where've you been
out all these weeks?

437
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,663
Things, you know?

438
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:12,040
I thought we had
something poppin' though.

439
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:17,212
We do have something poppin'.
I take care of my shit, don't l?

440
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,590
This taking care of shit?

441
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:24,219
What? Why would
you say that?

442
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,765
I handle my business, don't l, babe?
Come on, you know. What's the problem?

443
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,433
E, this isn't enough!

444
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,435
It ain't ever enough.

445
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,937
Whatever.

446
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,356
Your baby with your moms?

447
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:41,612
Uh-huh. So what else is it you really want,
E? You don't ever just stop by.

448
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,281
Keisha, you believe in me?

449
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,366
Yeah.

450
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:50,454
So l'ma keep it
a hundred then with you.

451
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,289
I need to borrow
some money. What?

452
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,374
I knew it.

453
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:57,628
No, listen. l promise you l'll
pay you back with interest.

454
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,755
Fuck it.

455
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,942
Smile for me, baby.

456
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,030
Don't be a stranger.

Naw, the one with
the donk, remember the...

458
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,977
Yo, Roman. lsn't that that
dude that deals for Green?

459
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:57,354
Yeah, the little
punk-ass from Lalo's.

460
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,022
You got some l D on you?

461
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,149
No, l don't have
any l D on me, sir.

462
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,361
That bitch better not be talkin'
about what he saw last night.

463
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:08,323
Yeah, l'm gonna have to have a word
with his bitch-ass a little later, too.

464
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:11,326
This chump looks
like a snitch, Roman.

467
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:26,508
It's kinda fresh. l like
the rhyme on this joint.

468
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,218
What's wrong with
ou? You hungry?

469
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,596
No.

470
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,140
We can stop off at this chicken
place and get some take-out.

471
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,559
(Ro-Bo) The place with
the double-fried extra crispy?

Yes, with the hot sauce, with the
French fries underneath, bread be soggy.

473

Yo, y'all motherfuckers need to
stop thinkin' with y'all guts, man.

474

We're going to the signing.
Fuck the chicken.

475
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,452
I'm just saying, if you're hungry,
we could stop and get some for later.

476
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,658
I hear you, but stop thinking
about all this little shit all the time.

extra-crispy number three with sesame seeds

got no money to buy it with.

480

I was just tryin' to look out for you,
but whatever.

481
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,881
Stay focused.

482
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,431

Gun it! Get down, man!

00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,336
Yes,

00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,213
It wasn't me. l just

518
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,465
You got my money?

520
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,972
Motherfucker, you're gonna

521
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,641
I didn't do it.

522
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,705
You did that shit. You know how long it took
me to get that shit the way it's at now?

523
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,063
I didn't do it.

524
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,397
That's your tag!

525
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,815
No, it's not.

526
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,400
It's your motherfucking tag.

527
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,569
I just came for my demo.

528
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:35,155
For your demo? Clean
that fucking shit off my wall.

529
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,407
If you say so, lemme

530
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,182
Yo, what up?

531
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,767
Who you with, motherfucker!

532
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,852
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I ain't with nobody.

533
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,354
Who you with?

534
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,314
I ain't with nobody,
l'm a rapper!

535
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:13,610
You a fucking rapper? Bust me out a rhyme,
then! Now!

536
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:17,781
All right. l got no battle rap, but l
see y'all pullin up in the black Cadillac,

537
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:20,784
two dudes, guns in hand,
y'all are tellin' me l gotta rap.

538
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:23,370
Y'all put me on the spot?
To see if l'm hot?

539
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,039
Like a chick given
brains l go off the top.

540
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:28,125
This motherfucker ain't too bad.

541
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,919
Matter of fact,
l need goons for security op.

542
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,921
Real talk l don't claim no set.

543
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:35,715
I'm nothin' but a rapper
tryin' to get that check.

544
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:29,436
Hey, yo boss, man! Why we
going through all this trouble, man?

545
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,606
Maze is washed up, he ain't
even got a new album out or nothin'.

546
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,066
It doesn't matter.
He's still a name.

547
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:38,528
Plus, business is hurtin'. This
promotion's gonna be beneficial.

548
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,364
Yeah, especially after he
shot some nightclub up man.

549
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:44,451
Ain't nothin' like the smell of
death to bring out the dogs.

550
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:47,329
We should be getting
danger money for this man.

551
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:50,373
I'm putting my life on the line,
they're gonna come in here...

552
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,335
Look, all you gotta do is be
cool and sell some records, okay?

553
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,929
[jumbled voices]

554
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,642
How you doin',
man? Actually l'm a part of A-Maze's crew.

555
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,644
No, l got a meeting with Gary.

556
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:11,645
What's your name?

557
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,313
Young Eastie.

558
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,690
I ain't got no Young
Easton on this list.

559
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:18,902
It ain't on the list. l'm here to meet
Gary. l gotta get the demo to him.

560
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:20,904
You gotta go to the
back like everybody else.

561
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:28,328
[all talk at a time]

562
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,919
[people cheer]

563
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:38,171
This place is an ambush.

564
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:45,220
You see that? That gotta get out of here,
after yesterday?

565
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:50,392
That shit gotta get out of my site.
Motherfuckers ain't got no sense.

566
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:51,893
What the fuck is wrong with you?

567
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,186
What's wrong, B?

568
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,521
What's this B-Bone shit?

569
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,273
I sell his records, too.

570
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,566
This is some bullshit.

571
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:02,737
No, don't worry about it, l got it. Shoes,
get rid of that thing, man.

572
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:08,451
[all talking at the same time]

00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,169
Thank ya'll for comin' out,

574
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,297
New shit comin' out soon.
Hot shit, too.

575
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,756
Here's my CD.

576
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,092
This your shit right here?

577
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:27,971
Yeah, man, that's all

578
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:35,186
This is for you. There's a track,
l know you take it, you blow it up.

579
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:42,319
Let me slide through here
y'all real quick, please.

580
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:45,488
Yo, Gary! Yo, Gary!

581
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:49,993

00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,873
Gary! Yo! My man!

584
00:38:57,293 --> 00:39:00,295
Dude, move! You

585
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:03,006
A-Maze! Was that your gun
that was fired off last nignt?

586
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,592
This is for fans only, a'ight?

587
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,678
Can you confirm there's a rap war
going on between yourself and B-Bone?

588
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,097
He made a statement already.

589
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,808
I can make your life real tough.
Don't screw with the Miami Herald.

590
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,811
Why don't you make my life
tough? See how far that gets you.

591
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:19,689
I got all the answers l want.

592
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:23,318

Take a picture of that.

593

These fucking clowns. Ro-Bo,

595
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,200
That's it!

596
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:32,535
I see you ain't
doing nothing, Maze!

597
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:36,539
Amaze wants to thank everyone for
coming out. Get the album real soon.

598
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:40,210
Read it, baby! Read it!

I already cleaned up.
Let me get a break.

This guys a clown,

633
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,806
Let me ask you a question.

00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,266
Yeah.

635
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,726
Do l look stupid to you?

636
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,229
What're you talking about?

637
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:07,482
Don't play me like a fool. You know
how long it took me to build this business?

638
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:10,068
No, l never thought about it.

639
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:13,530
You should think aboput it. You don't think
l know you're dealing out of the window?

640
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:16,115
Dealing what? l'm not

The green stuff. Come on,

Plus, my cash register's

First l'm dealin', now l'm stealing

645
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:31,881
Do me a favor and

Empty my pockets?
No, that's illegal.

647

Empty your pockets.
I'm gonna ask you again.

There it is.
Your contract.

1317
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:24,298
Now, before you sign this,
l want you to take a minute to think,

1318
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:28,135
because l know this is what
you've been dreaming of all your life.

1319
01:28:28,219 --> 01:28:33,557
But, son, some dreams
become nightmares.

1320
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:38,979
When you sign this,
your life is no longer your own.

1321
01:28:39,063 --> 01:28:42,566
There'll be cousins that you
never seen at any family reunion.

1322
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:46,278
Chicks that can't even get pregnant,
calling Maury Povich.

1323
01:28:46,362 --> 01:28:49,072
Friends that agree with
whatever the fuck you saying

1324
01:28:49,115 --> 01:28:51,575
just as long as you
picking up the check.

1325
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:54,619
Cats waiting for you to give
them a stimulus package.

1326
01:28:54,704 --> 01:28:57,497
And relatives that have
been there since day one,

1327
01:28:57,582 --> 01:29:01,668
who always knew little Eastie was
gonna make something out of himself.

1328
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:04,463
And that's not even
counting the haters,

1329
01:29:04,547 --> 01:29:07,257
the critics,

1330
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:12,971
little knuckleheads that's trying
to step to you, runnin' up on you.

1331
01:29:13,056 --> 01:29:17,142
Now, if you can deal
with all that, hm.

1332
01:29:18,394 --> 01:29:20,729
Sign.

1333
01:29:20,813 --> 01:29:25,067
But if you have the slightest doubt
in your mind, and l mean the slightest,

1334
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:30,197

this meeting right now.
