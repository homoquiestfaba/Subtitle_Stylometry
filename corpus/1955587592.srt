411
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,640

412
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,490

413
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,820

465
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,020

it is exactly the opportunity that you looking for, okay

467
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,310

I know,she nice, she nice

471
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,490
but it's now's the worse time than ever to think about starting family

472
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,440
I mean, look at the middle east

473
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,920
and public schools, and the economy

474
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,920
I can't take her to Tuscan.

475
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,970
what the fuck are you talking about?
you don't start a family, you just taking here to work.

476
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,950
you destroy only a motive transportation

477
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,670
it's at least you can do

478
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,880
as a bonus

479
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,800

if it's any help, I'm pretty sure I'm getting fired on Monday

536
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,980
how that would be any help?

537
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,610
I don't know how I'm going to pay my rent.

538
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,610
don't know how you're gonna fix my scooter.

539
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,960
scrat...???

540
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,960
yo, many dude?

541
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,960
what can I do for you?
-are you here for business?

542
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,490
oh I am not really ice cream vendor

543
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,490
sorry, that's a bit misleading

544
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,950
you sitting outside of ice cream truck.

545
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,770
why don't you guys selling?

546
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,370
yeah

547
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,450
why aren't we selling?

548
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,970
ice cream for sale.

549
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,220
push pop.

550
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,460
yeah, there you go.

551
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,100
right

552
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,920
you know, boo, we're there.

553
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:45,440
there you go, ms Patrick, you stay at school.

554
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:48,590
so, how do we do?

555
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,090
thinking about 98 dollars

556
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:54,410
so, five more days like this and
we should be able to repair my scooter

557
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,140
you know you're a pretty good ice cream salesman

558
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,140
do you need an assistant?

559
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,920
I would love an assistant

560
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,510
if this was my real job.

561
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,900
but it's not

562
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,080
um

563
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,530
I supposed to detail a car today.

564
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,990
and it got stolen

565
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:13,190
and I was like panicking and freaked out, so I stole this truck

566
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,710
I'm pretty sure the person who stole

567
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,950
my car

568
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,410
was the same guy driving this truck
does that makes sense?

569
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,960
so you're a screw-up and a thief

570
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,690
yeah, just like a little bit, though

571
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,690
oaky

572
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,020
why don't we team up anyway?

573
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,000
we can sell some ice cream and
I'll help you find the car

574
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,780
I mean you don't have to do that
I can just drop you at your house

575
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,620
no, honestly, that's the last place I wanna be right now

576
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:39,580
plus I've seen every episode of Veronica Mars
so I'm pretty well prepared

577
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,410
okay

578
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,540
okay

579
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,540
so you said the guy that stole your car, was driving this ice cream truck

580
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,480
yeah, I'm pretty sure

581
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,690
why don't we go to his house and paying a little visit

582
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:53,040
okay, that's fine and dandy, but, how do you know where he lives

583
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:58,460
oh this house matches the ice cream truck pretty well

584
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,730
yeah, I think we found the fit

585
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,520
Deven

586
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,260
uh, yes, sorry, we're

587
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,330
looking for devon, have you seen him?

588
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,290
I haven't seen him

589
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,780
he's six dated years

590
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,090
are you blind?

591
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,040

592
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,380
that's my lady, you want come inside?

593
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,910
I have very sexually active imagination

594
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,430
you both come inside

595
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:26,470
yeah, I don't think we're gonna do that
can you just tell us where's devon is, please?

596
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,940
I'm not telling you anything unless, you do something

597
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,280
for me

598
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,160

599
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,520
oh god, I don't want anything from you boy

601
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,380

602
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,460

604
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,340

00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,880

he's angry

634
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,320
he used to sell ice cream

635
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,800
maybe something more visual

636
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,880
right

637
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,710

650
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,850
did you steal my car?

651
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,370
no, what?

652
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,110
is your dad a blind clown?

653
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,020
he's a face penny alcoholic

654
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,020
and he's two setps away from home, yeah, but

655
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,840
he's definitely not blind

656
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,810
you're lucky I didn't call the cops for stealing my ice cream truck

657
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,880
yeah, why didn't anybody call the cops?

658
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,100
why not somebody call the f'ing the cops?

659
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:17,980
cus I've seen 'em

660
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,360
yeah, yeah, eveybody leave me alone before I flip the fuck out

661
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,360
alright, calm down there, you little whipper-snapper

662
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:24,950
you wanna smoke up?

663
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,440
oh, shit homie

664
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,440
that sounds Taco Bell

665
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,080
au naturally, I assumed the (jager??) kid drives ice cream truck

666
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,860
was the same dude stole my car

667
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,170
that's makes sense.

668
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,960
that shit adds up

669
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,310
how is that shit adds up?

670
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,980
well, we got the truck, maybe you guys got some (tea??) intel.

671
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,060
you wanna make a trade?

672
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,780
dude, no deal man.

673
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,910
that f'ing truck ruined every summer vacation
I've had since I was 16 years old

674
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,850
honestly, getting it stolen, was the best thing happened to me

675
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,620
I all do now, man sit all day

676
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,620
smoke weed, slay hot chicks

677
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,850
chick to dicks

678
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,450
crying in this bowl, actually

679
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,550
guys, at the crime

680
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,250
did you see anyone who look suspicious?

681
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,880
uh, well there was this one big guy

682
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,160

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,160
like Randy Orton big, that's like a big show

684
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,960

688
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,330
it's like a tatto or something, it's like a

689
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,170
pyramid or Egypt or some shit

690
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,330

695
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,390

696
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,850

what is that?

901
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:10,350
ooh

902
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:12,350
that's my smoking apparatus

903
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:14,540
it's taking me over 11 years to acquire

904
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:16,340
it's pretty beautiful, uh?

905
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:18,820
I wouldn't really know

906
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:19,490
[blows raspberry]

907
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,340
but

908
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:21,270
[blows]

909
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,350
are you telling me you're a hip chick?

910
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,980
who writes fan fiction

911
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,260
in a leather bound journal

912
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:28,680
that used to work at this coffee shop
has never smoke pot

913
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:30,940
I never smoked anything, okay?

914
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,860
I mean, I just didn't

915
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:36,000
ride with those type of social circles, you know.

916
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:37,300
uh

917
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,400
what's it like?

918
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:40,520
[coughs]

919
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,380
I'll give you a crash course

920
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,070
oh, hi there

921
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:55,850
this is a bud of marijuana

922
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:57,840
for centuries mankind has worked

923
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,100
to create purest strains with the most

924
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,410
vivid highs

925
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:03,500
now although there's at least complex

926
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,370
joints probably most iconic smoking method

927
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:08,370
without getting even burn you gotta break up the bud

928
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,370
and to do that, I'd like to use

929
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:11,960
a grinder

930
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:16,280
now, before I was old enough to buy bulnsir???

931
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,620
papers I was using a couple low tech method

932
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,500
apples are the tasty way to smoke

933
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,800
but it could be awkward

934
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:27,380
as alternative, some kid smoking out of cans

935
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,700
then we have our glassware

936
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,340
the cornerstone in every smokers collection

937
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:36,340
the possibilities are endless

938
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:37,820
this includes

939
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:39,820
bongs

940
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,820
and, uh, ooh

941
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:43,250
pipes

942
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,250
and, um, uh

943
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:47,240
bubblers

944
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,480
um, what's a bubbler?

945
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,340
that's very good question.

946
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,820
it's bong pipe hydrator.

947
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:55,970
very effective

948
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,210
just don't rest it on his side

949
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:05,120
with most glass pieces you have to work the carburetor

950
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,500
this little hole let's you expire an oxygen

951
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,000
to get just a perfect amount of burn

952
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,830
if you looking to biggest height of weed conservation ratio

953
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,940
the waterfall method worth to gander

954
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,220
perfect suction

955
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,280
then we get our high tech stuff

956
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,810
like a vaporizer

957
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,110
it vaporize the pot so breath pure THC

958
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,710
quick high, no smoke

959
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:37,920
wow

960
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:40,340
you know a lot about stuff.

961
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:43,230
so you think you wanna try some?

962
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:45,520
uh, it's tempting

963
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,260
but no I'm good

964
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,860
c'mon, don't you do something about wanting to go on an adventure

965
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:50,880
and try new things

966
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:52,290
yeah, but

967
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:55,530
but, this is the opportunity to try something new

968
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,200
c'mon pick a piece

969
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:00,380
well, the bubbler was kinda cute.

970
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,500
-alright, you ready
-um

971
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,500
just breathe in

972
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,680
alright, now hold in

973
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,680
and exhale

974
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:21,300
[coughs] oh, man

975
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:24,780
the taste's weird

976
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:26,640
you're feeling it yet?

977
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:29,360
I heard it doesn't work the first time

978
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,460
oh, you're wrong girl

979
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:51,860
we want you at biggerday

980
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:53,360
you can get out ever

981
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,360
stuck here for life

982
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,360
it's true

983
00:48:57,990 --> 00:48:59,340
gotta go with that

984
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:10,780
did you see that?

985
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,800
this was a unique experience for Veronica

986
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:17,060
an agent of danger

987
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,060
a mistress of mayhem

988
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,060
she's a bad bitch

989
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,100
can't mess with her

990
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,960
what if? need blue pen

991
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,710
is you blue eyes

992
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:28,720
oh yeah

993
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:38,040
it is so amazing

994
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:41,130
you thought to be professional, like a

995
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,330
professional guitar player

996
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:46,330
had she ever been in love

997
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:49,200
it's female a fanciable fiction

998
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:51,920
has she?

999
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:53,280
we don't know?

1000
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:59,170
oh wait

1001
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:00,880
I got something

1002
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,260
you're gonna flip the shit over

1003
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:04,960
wait

1004
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:06,960
wait, wait, wait,

1005
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,960
we've forgotten about our internet research

1006
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:29,240
strawberry

1007
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,240
amazing

1008
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:16,360
it's funny how it takes only one event for the world to change

1009
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,200
Pearl Harbor, the San Francisco earthquake

1010
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,290
and canceling bob sponge square pants

1011
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,150
it's only altered the course of human history

1012
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:25,040
this may sound disastrous

1013
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:26,840
but as we saw all with Oliver and Megan

1014
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,170
the greatest adversities

1015
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:29,830
can lead to new opportunities

1016
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:45,130
good morning

1017
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:46,910
oh, moring

1018
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:48,910
you sleep like a bear

1019
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:50,580
I don't mean a hibernating one

1020
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,580
you make all sorta growly noises

1021
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:55,200
what happened last night

1022
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,960
we climbed the Himalaya's, made out

1023
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:58,670
watched "Donald Duck mathland"

1024
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,390
you drew this picture of us

1025
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,680
you did must of work but I did sharpie on the boobies

1026
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,990
so what? John G

1027
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:10,860
raped and murdered my

1028
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,320
wife on my chest

1029
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,740
that was me, I did really like the movie "memento"

1030
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:16,980
but, it was really hard to write backwards

1031
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:19,030
so I just went for the standard variation

1032
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:23,120
okay, where are my cloths and why does it smell weird in here?

1033
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:24,490
oh, yeah

1034
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:26,280
you decided to take all cloths off

1035
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,280
and rub icey huddle??? of your body

1036
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,280
you're passed out truly there after

1037
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:31,620
oh my god

1038
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:33,470
did we had sex?

1039
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:34,860
no

1040
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:36,400
wait

1041
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:38,120
was that an option?

1042
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,340
remind me to never smoke weed ever again

1043
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,480
noted

1044
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,720
but, check this out

1045
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,020
I went on inter-webs and type all seeing eye tattoo

1046
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,310
aux nard into google and I found this chick

1047
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:51,780
apparently she just tattooed some dude

1048
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,780
with same skin art chaco taco and baby dee

1049
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:54,630

Jeff, what the hell?
my eyes haven't even adjusted to the light yet

1054
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:05,770
gotta talk to you about last night

1055
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:08,580
we didn't not handle that situation in appropriate fashion

1056
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,840
I know, it was in a ___

1057
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,960

1058
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,140

1067
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,820
well, sometimes that's the way it works out

1068
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:31,860
Jeff

1069
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:32,640
yeah

1070
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,830
what the shit?

1071
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:37,300
let's go, and why those Mexicans parked
f'ing ice cream truck out there

1072
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,480

1073
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,300
whatever, you

00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,760
she is really pissed that

1075
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,760
you screwed up our special evening last night

1076
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:50,620
and by her mean pissed at you

1077
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:52,910
you realize her being pissed at me, right?

1078
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,590
look, you got stuff to do with the devil
I got stuff to do with the car

1079
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:56,910

1080
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:57,820
alright

1081
00:53:58,920 --> 00:53:59,820
Meegan

1082
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:02,080
if you want sometime

1083
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,080
my girlfriend much the same age as you

1084
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,080
so, maybe we could all get together

1085
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:07,150
kick it

1086
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:09,150

1092
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:21,640

1093
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:23,640

1103
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:46,710
no

1104
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,680
this is about my ex-boyfriend

1105
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:51,140
he keeps calling

1106
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,680
apparently last night he camped outside my apartment

1107
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,350
that dude's super intense

1108
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:56,210
yeah

1109
00:54:58,860 --> 00:54:59,860
so funny, I

1110
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,420
have all these fiends that are getting marred and having babies

1111
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:06,270
but I was with Billy for 7 years

1112
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:08,900
never thought I would settle down with him

1113
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:10,990
should have broken up with him a log time ago

1114
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:12,790
this whole thing pretty much my fault

1115
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:13,760
hey

1116
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:17,100
screw that guy, I mean at least you broke it off before it was to late

1117
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:20,400
can you imagine making that decision
after you had a mini-Megan

1118
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:21,760
like my parents

1119
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:24,920
you know what? Oliver

1120
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,420
you're not merely as much good as you pretend to be

1121
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:29,780
thanks

1122
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:31,700
doughnut?

1123
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:34,680
oh that's my favorite

1124
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,590
ooh, alright you can have it. that's fine

1125
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:44,960
I bet Oliver call a hooker after

1126
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,740
he saw us working last night

1127
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,420
no, I don't think so

1128
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:50,310
she didn't look like a pro to me

1129
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,250
what, are you kidding? did you see that tattoo on her chest

1130
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,190
oh was that __her?

1131
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,100
or, just she woke up.

1132
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,210
and Oliver said he didn't sleep with her

1133
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:01,880
um, ofcource he didn't, that kid's a pussy

1134
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:04,880
you know

1135
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:06,340
I don't appreciate you saying that

1136
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:08,760
I mean he's good kid, he's just a little lost right now

1137
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:14,380
you know what? you're right.

1138
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:17,330
I think we just we had to as we agreed you know

1139
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:19,080
help Oliver gets on his feet

1140
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:21,590
and Tuscan is the bright place to spread his wings

1141
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,690
and once he's moved out

1142
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:27,440
you and I can have the house to ourselves

1143
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,280

1144
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,210

01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:28,560
[barfing]

1266
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:32,220
strawberry cream sekum???

1267
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,060
can I barrow something else?

1268
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,210
I have just a thing

1269
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:40,210
so

1270
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:43,360
I was think that we start with disaster of garage

1271
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,760
maybe lay out some yoga mat

1272
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:49,110
put some pins on the walls, maybe a few mirrors

1273
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:51,980
make it like a little work out room

1274
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,260
sure

1275
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:54,880
do you remember my firend, Mary

1276
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:56,590
well, she makes these wine racks

1277
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:59,270
and I think there would be a super cute on a wine cellar

1278
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:00,920
wait, which one is that?

1279
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,790
the cute little breadhead form yoga with herpes

1280
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:05,730
no, witch room is the wine cellar

1281
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,190
wow, I was thinking that we could covert your office into a wine cellar

1282
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:14,480
make it like cool dark cave, with moodlights

1283
01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:17,360
I just think it's completely sad and dull as it is

1284
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,160
reminds me of work

1285
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:21,770
what do you say we jump into the pool

1286
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:23,310
I'm laying out

1287
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:25,850
you can't take break from chair for a second and jump in the pool?

1288
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,570
I can't get my hair wet

1289
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:29,310
what are you? a chinchilla?

1290
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:33,650
c'mon you take a shower everyday, what is it, your head dodge the shower water, c'mon

1291
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:38,100
you know you're being huge dick, this is my money maker

1292
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:39,680
makes the money

1293
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,680
I just don't understand why we're hanging out together

1294
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,680
we can't enjoy ourself and jump in the pool?

1295
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:46,600
ukh, you're grossing me out you sound like my dad right now

1296
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:49,030

1298
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,320
cannonball

1299
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:01,760
I can't believe you

1300
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:04,970

1301
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:07,480

1302
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:10,880

1304
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:14,290
I'm out of here

1305
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:18,840
why don't you go dry off your money maker?

1306
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:26,480
are you sure Benson gave us the right address?

1307
01:03:26,990 --> 01:03:29,230
you know that man never fibbed the facts

1308
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:30,980
you wanna a hit of this?

1309
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,470
it's platinum blue dream, puts you in the different plant-field

1310
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:34,660
no

1311
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:36,660
I don't think
I should be fighting crime under influence

1312
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:39,840
wait, wait, what are you doing?

1313
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:43,520
guns balzing, shoud we go with the plan

1314
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:46,660
you know what, you can hang back
there's nothing wrong with playing it safe

1315
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,520
okay, um

1316
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,660
I'm coming

1317
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:56,480
Oliver, I don't feel good about this

1318
01:03:56,550 --> 01:03:59,480
it's time, expecting unexpected, we have to catch him off guard

1319
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,860
you shouldn't knock on front door, it's pretty standard

1320
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:06,860
good point, maybe sticking around back trying find an open window

1321
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:09,450
it's not what I meant, I mean we're trespassing now

1322
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,240
and we talking in nonsense

1323
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:33,450

01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:02,650
Megan, you strong hound???

1351
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,650
we're  on the ocean already

1352
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,270
it's okay, calm down

1353
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,630

-what?

1354
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:14,290

1355
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,090
he took my stuff, he has my notebook

1356
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:20,590
yeah, I know, it's just stuff okay, what?

1357
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:22,120
the gun wasn't loaded

1358
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:24,480
you're ridiculous

1359
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,990
you put people in danger and you don't take responsibility for your actions

1360
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,320
and the worst part about it is

1361
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,600
you don't even noticed cus you always so stoned

1362
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:36,590
oh. c'mon, I hardly ever get stoned

1363
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:40,420
I have such high tolerance I probably
smoke like a pound to be fully functional

1364
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:42,790
let me ask you a question Oliver

1365
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:46,110

1366
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:47,340

1373
01:07:00,410 --> 01:07:02,320

1374
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:04,590

1375
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:08,320

01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:07,620
what do you looking at me for?

1378
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:09,090
I don't know what's comes next

1379
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:11,090
they didn't even get me updated pages

1380
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,400

01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:31,040

1385
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:40,700

I think you're gonna do great in Tuscan
I personally

1405
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,000
had a lot of success in Tuscan

1406
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:29,110
if you had so mush success in that shithole desert
what are you doing here

1407
01:09:29,110 --> 01:09:30,310
collecting cans?

1408
01:09:30,430 --> 01:09:32,170
I'm sorry, did I said success? I meant

1409
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:32,990
butt sex

1410
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:34,990
success, butt sex, success, butt sex

1411
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,200
I had a lot of butt sex

1412
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:38,570
in Tuscan

1413
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,570
irregardless of that matter

1414
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:42,030
do you have any weed?

1415
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:44,500

01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:48,960

1418
01:09:50,830 --> 01:09:52,230
simmering

1419
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,960
honey pot of a woman

1420
01:09:54,230 --> 01:09:55,390
did you

1421
01:09:55,550 --> 01:09:57,280
tap that ass
-no

1422
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,810
it was an option last night

1423
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:01,850
look man

1424
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:04,350
I generally try not to dispense advise on the couch

1425
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:06,800
it's sort of breach-er protocol

1426
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:09,710
but I think I can help you so, making an exception

1427
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:12,080
here's some advice

1428
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:14,410
one, find out what that woman wants

1429
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,800
two, give it to her

1430
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:19,240
now if you excuse me

1431
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:21,420
it's time for me to blast off

1432
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,940
I thought maybe you (spring|bring) for the good stuff

1433
01:10:31,330 --> 01:10:33,170
can you stay, dooo__

1434
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:36,160

1438
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:45,250
my apology is come a long my friend

1439
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:47,550

1440
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:49,310

1441
01:10:50,230 --> 01:10:52,830
