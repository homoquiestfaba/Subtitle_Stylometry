1
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,478
- Thanks for hooking me up.
- Any time, bro. Any time.

2
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:59,007
- How's your back coming along?
- Very nice, very nice. Very happening.

3
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,010
I'm gonna unveil it next week, bro.
Wait till you see it, man.

4
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,921
Marcus is like... He's a magician, bro.

5
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:09,518
I think she's got one on her lower back
she wants to brag about.

6
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,928
- Hey, what's up?
- You tell me.

7
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:15,758
- Is he here yet?
- Brought him in last night.

8
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:19,434
- Did you see who brought him in?
- Nah, supposedly he brought him in himself,

9
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:22,064
- you know, the big guy?
- Ziggy?

10
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:25,542
When we woke up,
there was an envelope on the table.

11
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,341
And I will raise.

12
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,176
And he left instructions for you.

13
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,509
For me, huh?

14
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:43,688
So what's the game, baby?
Who's taking who to dinner?

15
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:48,029
The Valium chip. Light blue.
Good color, man. I will see that.

16
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:51,264
I will raise 20 milligrams, baby.

17
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,770
Let's get high.

18
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,095
Thank God.

19
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,124
Where am I?

20
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,837
What is this place?

21
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,803
How long have I been here?

22
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,441
Who are you?

23
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,949
Whoever you are,

24
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:44,383
please help me.

25
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:48,025
Listen. I need your... I need your help.

26
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,186
Do you hear me?

27
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,300
Do you know how long I've been here?

28
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,500
What're you doing?

29
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,540
Please, please, whoever you are, help me.

30
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:05,736
I don't know what's going on,
but obviously this is...

31
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,313
This is some kind of mistake.

32
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,043
I mean, I was on my way to New York.

33
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,154
My name is Jimmy Vaughn.

34
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,254
Do I know you?

35
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,727
When I come into the room,

36
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,428
I speak and you listen.

37
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,238
Understand?

38
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,035
I question and you answer.

39
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,077
Nod if you understand the rules.

40
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,049
Ziggy has asked me to take care of this.

41
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,246
And believe me,
the more time that we spend here,

42
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:52,518
the more fun it'll be for me,
and the less fun it'll be for you.

43
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,184
Do you understand that?

44
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:02,064
So you were Ziggy's accountant.
Is that correct?

45
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,705
And you stole $10 million from him,
is that right?

46
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:20,749
Please.

47
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,388
Look at me, Mr. Green.

48
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,290
Mr. Green, I'm gonna leave you
to think about that answer.

49
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,325
But before I do,

50
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:38,302
you'll realize that sitting is a luxury
you don't have anymore.

51
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,004
I'll see you soon.

52
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,797
That's an unusual name.
How do you pronounce it?

53
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,059
"Now."

54
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,732
Well, I can't offer much.

55
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:47,795
I mean, with a high school equivalency
and military service,

56
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,907
would you consider security somewhere?

57
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,707
Pays like, $10 an hour.
I could maybe get you $12.

58
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:03,752
I was told to wait in line
specifically to talk to you.

59
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,080
Why me?

60
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:08,319
'Cause there's only one man
I'd like to work for, Mr. Gnoww.

61
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,362
I don't know what you're talking about.

62
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,692
Right.

63
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,444
I asked you nicely,

64
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,480
and now I'm gonna demand
that you tell me where to go,

65
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,141
or I'm gonna blow your brains out.

66
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:34,651
He doesn't respect men who carry guns.

67
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:37,647
That's why I brought this.

68
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,748
Now I'm gonna shove
this in your fucking mouth,

69
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:40,952
and blow your brains out,

70
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,154
or you're gonna tell me
where I can find him.

71
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,490
No?

72
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,139
I pull this pin and it's over.

73
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,150
Take a large coffee.

74
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,150
That's $2.25.

75
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:22,000
This is horrible. I'm not paying for it.
Let me talk to your manager.

76
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,433
- Can I help you?
- I can't drink this.

77
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,005
What's the problem?

78
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,604
The coffee's way too wet.

79
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,512
Too wet?

80
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,977
Let me take you in the back.

81
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,383
Perhaps you prefer
some of our dry coffee blends.

82
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,400
So what's your name?

83
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,062
Jimmy Vaughn.

84
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:02,197
Well, Jimmy, our dry coffee

85
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,211
is right through here.

86
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:12,482
The key to making dry coffee
is the dry beans.

87
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:17,384
And dry beans
comes from drought-inflicted areas.

88
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,485
It's a difficult thing
to find such a happy medium

89
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,325
between the moisture needed
to grow beans,

90
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:28,197
and the absolute dry heat
truly needed to get dry coffee.

91
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,731
I am no novice to this concept.

92
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:38,670
I've traveled to the forests myself
in pursuit of the evasive, perfect blend.

93
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:46,107
You have to look everywhere for the beans.

94
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:56,024
In an animal's armpits, stomach, legs.

95
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,293
And sometimes

96
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,605
it's stuck in a tree shaft.

97
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:10,267
So you have to stick your hand inside
and feel around.

98
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:17,078
This procedure may feel
a little uncomfortable.

99
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,051
You're clean. Turn around.

100
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:34,996
Pull your pants up.

101
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:45,507
Go stand in the back alley.
I'll call you a ride. They'll come pick you up.

102
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:48,637
All you have to do is say, "Yes, please."

103
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:52,684
- Where am I going?
- I don't know. I've never taken the ride.

104
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,087
Then how'd you get the job?

105
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,988
My dad worked for him.
This was his life insurance policy.

106
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:03,121
I get paid 10 grand a month
for fingering guys like you.

107
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:26,577
Hey man, me and my friends just got out.
You wanna get in and vacuum our asses?

108
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,176
Yes, please.

109
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,724
Hello, Jimmy Vaughn. You're a stupid guy.

110
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:16,192
Only stupid people get brought to us.

111
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:19,260
I'm Mo. Larry. Curly.

112
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,273
Question.
Why would the big guy give you a job?

113
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,041
Why wouldn't he?

114
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,290
You got a quick mouth, yeah?

115
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,451
Larry's got a pretty quick
fucking wrench, too.

116
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,052
Every day,
Larry and Curly are gonna come in here,

117
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:48,760
and they're gonna beat you senselessly
until you leave.

118
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,467
I won't fight back. You're not my enemy.

119
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,235
I wanna be your brother.

120
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:00,907
I wanna be your brother.

121
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,244
Only Ziggy can decide that.

122
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:48,222
So, any news today, Kevin?

123
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,227
Today was a big day.

124
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,024
Congratulations.

125
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,738
Brian Marks.

126
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,419
So Agent Cole, I read your brief,

127
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,260
and it seems that your assessment's correct.

128
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,228
Ziggy's aware of you.

129
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,990
Is there an Archie Green
reported missing yet?

130
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:30,501
Not yet.

131
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,839
Why do you think he requested you
to deal with Green?

132
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:39,036
I don't know.
I mean, I guess maybe I've earned his trust.

133
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:41,875
I mean I've been, what,
running errands for six months now.

134
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:45,246
Yeah, but that was small potatoes.
This seems much bigger.

135
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,342
Have you met anybody
who's seen him lately?

136
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,614
No, apparently Ziggy brought him in,
in the middle of the night,

137
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,019
but my guys didn't see him.

138
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,548
- How recent's our latest picture of him?
- It's seven years old. It's unusable.

139
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:55,719
Yeah, he's a master of disguises.

140
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:58,262
He's had total reconstructive
plastic surgery.

141
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,355
If you get to anybody
who claims to have seen him lately,

142
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,957
- bag them and get them in here.
- You got it.

143
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,595
- Congratulations, Agent Cole.
- Thank you, Agent Murphy.

144
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,434
Cole, almost forgot.

145
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:12,304
Your itinerary.
You've been requested to Washington

146
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,208
by the Director.

147
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,605
- When?
- Tonight.

148
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,548
- Tell him I'll see him tomorrow.
- Smart ass.

149
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,643
He'll know where I got it from.

150
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:29,586
Hey.

151
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,761
What's going on? Did you buy groceries?

152
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,158
Better, sweetheart. We're celebrating.

153
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,566
What are we celebrating?

154
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:43,337
- A big day at work.
- A big day for my big man?

155
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,278
I like that. So what'd you get?

156
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:54,176
- We have flowers.
- I'll take that.

157
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:59,283
- We have expensive wine.
- I'll take that.

158
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,757
And we have gourmet cuisine.

159
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,090
Let's keep that for later.

160
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,329
- For later?
- After we celebrate.

161
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:29,684
I love that shirt.

162
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,282
I know you do.

163
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,226
- Is it cold?
- No.

164
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,137
Smells great, though.

165
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:50,636
Perfect.

166
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,914
Just give it to me.

167
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:04,152
- I want to get you a good bite.
- You'll give me that perfect bite.

168
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,016
Chinese food really juices me up.

169
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:12,387
They have produced, like, a billion people.

170
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:21,532
So, did anything happen today
that I could hear about?

171
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:26,768
Yeah. Brian and I sat at our desks

172
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,005
and we played solitaire.

173
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:33,449
And I beat his ass
for about the 50th time in a row.

174
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,850
I should beat your ass.

175
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,689
I'm serious.

176
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:42,120
Becky.

177
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:47,691
The only thing that I can tell you
is that I love you.

178
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,302
Come here.

179
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,210
One more bite for me, please.

180
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,640
Oh, really?

181
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,635
Mr. Green, I warned you.

182
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:12,706
This will only stop
when Ziggy gets his money back.

183
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,009
I don't have his money.

184
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,557
I've explained the rules to you, Mr. Green.

185
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:33,899
Why do you think
he believes that you stole his money?

186
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,530
I don't know.

187
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,503
I did some work for him.

188
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,207
But it was always via P.O. box,
from accountant to accountant.

189
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:49,781
We double-checked
and triple-checked each other's work.

190
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,181
If there was a mistake, it wasn't my fault.

191
00:19:55,794 --> 00:20:00,231
Mr. Green,
I'm gonna leave you today with this thought.

192
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,728
I'm about to tear the final fingernail
off your hand.

193
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:10,571
You... You're leaving me...
You're leaving me no choice, you see?

194
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:14,043
Now tomorrow, I'm gonna come back
and I'm gonna do the other hand.

195
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:18,708
And then the following day I'll do one foot,
and then I'll do the other.

196
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:23,887
And then I'm gonna have to start
getting creative as to what else to rip off.

197
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:31,089
Now, is there anything

198
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:36,824
that you'd like to tell me
before I get to your thumb?

199
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,437
Please, I have a family.

200
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,298
I have a wife

201
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,945
and a beautiful... Beautiful daughter.

202
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,448
You understand?

203
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,181
No. No!

204
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,553
Are you ready for this?

205
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,358
Ziggy told us four days was enough.

206
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,693
He's got a job for you.

207
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,642
Thank you.

208
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:31,679
I've been waiting for this for two years
and this is who he sends.

209
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,741
You're Harry Rusick?

210
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,787
Well, maybe I'll ask you. What is your name?

211
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:38,412
Jimmy Vaughn.

212
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,784
How long have you known the big guy?

213
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:44,384
How long? I never met him.

214
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,962
Never met him. Even better for me.

215
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:59,339
How long have you known him?

216
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:03,944
Forty years.
I knew him from the neighborhood.

217
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:09,018
I introduced him to Mickey.
That's how long ago I knew him.

218
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:13,852
Now, please,

219
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,294
please tell him
that I'm trying to stay the course.

220
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:18,920
You got that?

221
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:24,427
And I got a guy
who wants a sniff of something real potent.

222
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,528
So stay laxed. Okay?

223
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,638
Laxed. You got it?

224
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,110
I got it.

225
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:37,977
Most importantly,

226
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:42,518
tell him that I understand what I did,
and that...

227
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:48,388
I'd appreciate him letting me out of here
as soon as I repay him.

228
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,685
- He's the one that's got you in here, huh?
- What?

229
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,561
You think these fucking assholes
make any kind of decisions whatsoever?

230
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,224
All right, pal.

231
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,492
- Don't fuck up, kid.
- Release the visitor.

232
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,004
- He never forgets.
- Let's go, Rusick!

233
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:03,632
- He never forgets.
- Rusick!

234
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,690
<i>Yes, I'll have him call you back. Thank you.</i>

235
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,923
<i>Director Cole's office.</i>
<i>Yes, he's in a meeting. Yes, thank you.</i>

236
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,265
Agent Cole.

237
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:32,837
I don't think he'd like me telling you this,
but...

238
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:36,033
He talks about you all the time.

239
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,405
We were all praying for you
while you were over there.

240
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,671
I appreciate your prayers.

241
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:43,612
Kevin, get your butt in here.

242
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,212
- Good to see you, Son.
- Good to see you, Dad.

243
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:49,378
- Looking good.
- Thank you.

244
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:51,547
Welcome to Washington.

245
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:54,717
You know, I get calls
from the leadership of both parties

246
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:58,092
asking me
if you'd consider running for Congress.

247
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:02,431
They just wanna know,
are you a Democrat or a Republican?

248
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:06,264
Ask them what the difference is, these days.

249
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:10,538
Just like that, Kevin Cole is out of politics.

250
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,475
So, what's this I hear
about you being a field agent?

251
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:21,979
I don't know. What did you hear?

252
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,816
Kevin, why?

253
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:27,425
Come on, Dad.
We've been over this a thousand times.

254
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:31,895
Why the hell do you always insist
on doing everything the hard way?

255
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,760
Because I'm your son.

256
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:36,426
And if I take anything easy,
then for the rest of my life,

257
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:40,835
people will say that I got there because
my dad's the Director of the Bureau.

258
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:45,308
And besides, taking the hard way
is the way you took, too.

259
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,968
Yeah. Well...

260
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:54,650
I've been reading your latest brief
on the Ziggy Operation.

261
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:55,913
Yeah?

262
00:25:56,955 --> 00:26:00,288
- I want you to pull yourself out.
- Pull myself out?

263
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:03,452
- I just got noticed.
- That's why it's time.

264
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:05,962
The next thing to happen
is you're gonna get compromised,

265
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,965
and then we'll have to pull you out.

266
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,263
Poor mark like that on your record,

267
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:12,633
it's gonna spoil your chances
for a quick promotion.

268
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:15,104
But a success could ensure it.

269
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,845
Kevin, listen to me.

270
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:25,212
I never told you not to enlist,
not to go to Afghanistan.

271
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:29,485
But I'm telling you now,
this is a really bad move.

272
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:33,949
You have no idea what Ziggy's capable of.

273
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:39,394
I know you know his organization
and the scum he does business with,

274
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,960
that he trades IEDs for heroin.

275
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:49,538
What you don't know
is how deep he can get his hooks in you.

276
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:53,407
I do. Twenty-five years ago,
I got that close to him,

277
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:55,342
and I still couldn't bring him down.

278
00:26:55,413 --> 00:27:00,180
So wouldn't it be a great story
if your son was the one that finally did?

279
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:09,319
You said you'd only do one foot at a time.

280
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:10,884
I lied.

281
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,658
I'm sure you're familiar with the technique.

282
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:21,830
You bastard. Bastard.

283
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:30,844
Mr. Green, in a day or so,
one of two things will happen.

284
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,018
Your wounds will get infected,

285
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:38,055
or your body will be unable
to clot all the wounds,

286
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:40,921
and you'll drip the blood until death.

287
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:47,030
Now you can dip your toes
into this bucket of salt, which will help.

288
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,999
It will also hurt like a bitch.

289
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:56,233
Or I can stitch you up myself,
with anaesthetic,

290
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:59,573
for just a little piece of information.

291
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:08,412
I can...
I can give you a little piece of information.

292
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:17,852
I'm listening.

293
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:26,597
My daughter's name is Sheila,
and my wife's name is Gloria.

294
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:29,839
I love them so much.

295
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:36,313
They're all I have in the world.

296
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:40,006
I didn't steal Ziggy's money.
I would never do that.

297
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,644
But I'll pay it back.

298
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:49,554
I swear I will, if I have to work
the rest of the days of my life,

299
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:51,652
if you just let me go.

300
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,290
If you just let me go.

301
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:10,004
Ziggy wants his own money back,
Mr. Green.

302
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,481
He doesn't make
those types of deals anymore.

303
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:36,036
No!

304
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,539
No. No!

305
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,337
- Hey.
- No!

306
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:45,709
Kevin.

307
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:50,081
It's me. Baby. It's me. It's Becky.

308
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,582
You all right?

309
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,852
It was just a bad dream.

310
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:10,972
- You ever had therapy before?
- Never.

311
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:14,741
West Point, Honors.

312
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:19,274
Rangers in Afghanistan, Delta.
Saw your share of action?

313
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,147
You're looking at my file,
you know who I am.

314
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:26,155
- You ever have these nightmares over there?
- No. I was just happy to get some sleep.

315
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:29,658
Should I assume
you're Director Jack Cole's son?

316
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:30,989
You should.

317
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:34,997
- What's your relationship like with him?
- It is what it is.

318
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:38,299
How's your relationship with your mom?

319
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:46,243
She passed away a couple years ago,
right before I got back from active duty.

320
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:50,614
I'm sorry. The two of you close?

321
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,515
We're not here to talk about my family.

322
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:58,645
Fair enough.
Would you mind having a seat?

323
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,987
Well, listen.

324
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:07,997
It's clear you got a lot of weight
on your shoulders.

325
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:09,691
You're a very sharp guy.

326
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:12,861
We should be able to find
the source of these nightmares.

327
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:16,134
Why don't you just start by telling me
what's new in your life.

328
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:19,335
Who's listening,
and what kind of clearance do you have?

329
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:22,880
- You couldn't be in a safer place.
- Is that right?

330
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:25,609
Yeah, I was hired many years ago
by the Bureau

331
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:30,052
to talk specifically to the best agents
in the field about the job.

332
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:32,952
You can't imagine the clearance I have.

333
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:40,029
My nightmares are visions of
this undercover operation that I'm a part of.

334
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:41,860
And what is that?

335
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:45,859
Please.

336
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,494
- Kevin, help me.
- Kevin, help me.

337
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:51,906
And then you woke up screaming,
just because of that?

338
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,342
You weren't trained
to mercilessly torture people,

339
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,508
you were trained to be Captain America.
It's in your blood, for God's sakes.

340
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,246
- I see two options here.
- What's that?

341
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:05,254
Well, if you wanna stop seeing images
of Green's wife and daughter, then...

342
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:08,223
Don't let him lead the conversation
into his personal life.

343
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:11,056
And, two, I'd just request a transfer.

344
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:14,923
They assign you a different case.
It happens all the time.

345
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:18,992
And then you can tell Becky
that the problem is over.

346
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,739
And no one will ever know
the reason for the transfer.

347
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:25,002
That won't work for me because I'll know.

348
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,409
I'll see you.

349
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:31,505
- Mo, you ever go in the vault with Green?
- Nah, that's not my job, Jimmy.

350
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:34,779
Yeah? What's your job? What do you do?

351
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,112
- Aside from drinking?
- Yeah.

352
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,621
- Being a professional alcoholic.
- That's it.

353
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:43,558
Jimmy, I sit here, I guard the door,
I mail off the tapes,

354
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:47,558
and I make sure no one walks in
and pops your ass.

355
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,429
- Cheers.
- Love you, baby.

356
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:50,899
- Glass up.
- Yeah.

357
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:53,197
I actually mail the tapes.

358
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,569
And I write out the envelopes.

359
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:58,164
I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble.

360
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:00,073
- The tapes, recordings of when I'm in there?
- Yeah.

361
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:02,339
Over there in the closet.

362
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:06,878
Where do you mail them to?
Just out of curiosity.

363
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:09,351
P.O. box, for your evaluation.

364
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:14,088
- Don't go fuck up our system.
- Larry, don't get so serious.

365
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:16,922
I ain't feeling the love.
I ain't feeling no love, man.

366
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,859
- Where'd the love go?
- I don't know, man.

367
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,296
- It's to who?
- Down, boy.

368
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,635
- I fold. I'm out. Yeah.
- You're out?

369
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,929
The system is a series of drops,

370
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:31,873
and Green has confirmed exactly
what the three wise men said.

371
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,137
Three wise men?

372
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:36,145
The three whacked-out fiends
who play cards in the kitchen.

373
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,715
Now, if we can figure out
who leases the P.O. boxes

374
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:41,911
and who makes the pickups,
we might be able to get our leads.

375
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:43,385
And the camera in the vault?

376
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:46,423
The recording device
appears to be a live remote feed.

377
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:49,119
We already checked.
The signal's untraceable.

378
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,717
Good to know.

379
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:55,892
Two hours ago, LAPD got a report
that Archie Green was missing.

380
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:01,433
- He's been gone two days.
- His wife thought he was on a business trip.

381
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,667
And we can't inform LAPD of the operation.

382
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:06,437
Ziggy's way over their jurisdiction.

383
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:13,009
Just be prepared now for any hurried tactics
in trying to get him to talk.

384
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:19,079
- Hey, Jimmy.
- What's going on, Mo?

385
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:21,648
- You're late, bro.
- Late?

386
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:23,488
- Yeah.
- Late for what?

387
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:26,461
The big guy just sent a package for you.

388
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:31,929
- Did he bring it himself?
- No, man, I didn't ask his name.

389
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:34,836
Some old guy in a suit said,
"Give this to Jimmy."

390
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:37,499
He said the code is your birthday.

391
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:50,880
- Anything good?
- More toys.

392
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:56,221
Call me Santa. I come bearing gifts.

393
00:34:57,695 --> 00:34:59,287
We've got this.

394
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:03,828
Festive. Or we've got this.

395
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:16,803
You haven't had solid food in days.
Why don't we start with a little treat?

396
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,075
Okay.

397
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,580
Mr. Green, just relax.

398
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:30,991
Nothing's going to happen
if you just tell me what I need to know.

399
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:36,398
Let's start with a place.
Give me a place to look.

400
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,765
Is the money in the Caymans?

401
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,332
- No.
- Zurich?

402
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:49,075
Rome? The money's in Rome?

403
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:54,514
Jimmy, I already told you.
I don't have Ziggy's money.

404
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:57,913
I know I can't prove it.

405
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:04,752
But how can I disprove a false accusation
when I don't have any understanding of it?

406
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:09,397
Now you could tell me anything.
You could tell me the sky is red outside.

407
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,526
To me right now, in here, the sky is blue.

408
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:17,432
Until we're both standing outside
under the same sky,

409
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,702
it's your word against mine.

410
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:25,374
We both have the same kind of credibility.
So you gotta help me, Jimmy.

411
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:29,044
Tell me the facts.
Tell me who told you I stole Ziggy's money.

412
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,588
Ziggy told me you stole the money
and that's all I need to know.

413
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,419
- That's all he said? He didn't say how?
- Mr. Green, I'm growing impatient.

414
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:38,188
- You hear me!
- He didn't say which account the money...

415
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:46,900
Mr. Green, I'm hoping the electricity
woke up some forgotten memories.

416
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,917
Babe?

417
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:13,957
Hey.

418
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,897
I tried to wait up for you.

419
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:25,741
Come lie down. Come lie down.

420
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:54,766
Hello?

421
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:58,434
<i>Hello, Jimmy. I didn't wake you, did I?</i>

422
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,677
- Who is this?
<i>- You know who this is.</i>

423
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:01,802
Baby...

424
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:05,337
<i>I've been watching your sessions</i>
<i>with Archie Green.</i>

425
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,314
<i>Nice work, Jimmy.</i>

426
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:10,113
<i>What's your gut telling you?</i>

427
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:12,815
My gut's telling me
to do whatever it is that you want.

428
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,620
<i>While that's the correct answer</i>
<i>most of the time,</i>

429
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:19,891
<i>this is one of those rarities</i>
<i>when I'm really asking your opinion.</i>

430
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:23,330
<i>- Do you think he stole the money?</i>
- Yes.

431
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:27,229
<i>So do I. Carry on with your sessions.</i>

432
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:29,636
Thank you, sir.

433
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:32,505
<i>And Jimmy, try to get some sleep.</i>

434
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,814
Don't you ever do that again.

435
00:38:57,034 --> 00:39:00,731
- What're you doing here?
- I flew in first thing this morning

436
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,863
as soon as I heard Ziggy had called you.

437
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,034
Yeah, well,
we're not 100% sure it was Ziggy.

438
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,445
Whoever it was jammed our trace.

439
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:13,449
I've dealt with him before.
I'll lay you odds it was Ziggy.

440
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:16,213
How do you wanna proceed from here?

441
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:20,352
I finish the operation,
I get Ziggy and I bring him to justice.

442
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:23,222
Agent Cole, I was not speaking to you.

443
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:28,191
Sit down and listen
while Director Cole and I reach a decision.

444
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:33,503
He's been underground a long time.
Why would he call Kevin last night?

445
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:38,534
Why surface? Why now?

446
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,736
And what's this Archie Green thing
all about, anyway?

447
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:45,782
Sir, you don't believe
it's about the $10 million?

448
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,510
I have no idea.

449
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:51,019
We don't know what Green knows.

450
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,017
That's the real question.

451
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:02,060
Please, please.
I'll tell you anything you want.

452
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,431
Anything I can, anything you wanna know
that I actually know...

453
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:05,934
Don't hurt me anymore.

454
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:08,561
This is me now. It's me. It's me.

455
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,970
Now just relax. Just relax.

456
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:51,675
Now, we're gonna try to retrace your steps
to remember the exact moment

457
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:54,676
when you made 10 million mistakes.

458
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:58,512
Mr. Green, I'm gonna let you speak freely.

459
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:02,924
How long have you known Ziggy?

460
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:07,089
A long time.

461
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:10,531
Twenty... Twenty to twenty-five years.

462
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:14,299
I met him at a card game.

463
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:19,135
It was a high stakes game at...

464
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:23,377
Mickey Sullivan's place in the basement.

465
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,177
And how did your relationship
move forward?

466
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:28,012
He had just adopted a little girl.

467
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:31,315
She was, I don't know,
seven, eight years old.

468
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:36,549
And he was having problems with her.
Anyway, that's because he wasn't married.

469
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:39,452
And I had just gotten married, so I...

470
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:44,866
I offered up my wife, Gloria,
to take her shopping and stuff like that.

471
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:50,963
- Ziggy's daughter?
- Yes.

472
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,309
What's her name?

473
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,677
Tally.

474
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:04,310
My wife Gloria and Tally
would go shopping and the movies.

475
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:08,149
You know, girly foolishness.

476
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:22,267
You see how easy this can be, Mr. Green?

477
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:24,507
Please, continue.

478
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:30,371
Well, one week at the game, Z tells me...
That's what we called him, Z.

479
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:34,607
He tells me, he says,
"Archie, you look tired."

480
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:39,788
I explained to him how I was working
my tail off at Arthur Andersen.

481
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:45,284
He tells me he's a pretty wealthy guy.

482
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,763
He doesn't make a big deal out of it.
It's nothing showy.

483
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:53,530
He just says it matter-of-factly,
like he was presenting something to me.

484
00:42:55,105 --> 00:43:00,737
You know,
he started out in Streets and Sanitation.

485
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,705
Up in Chino, I think.

486
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,944
Anyway, he told me he would give me
the books to one of his companies,

487
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:11,385
and that if he liked my work,
he would pay me twice my annual salary.

488
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:12,717
Twice.

489
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:16,323
I did it.

490
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:23,061
I left Arthur Andersen,
started my own little practice.

491
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:28,302
I only had one client.
I started with one client.

492
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:30,896
I still to this day only have one client.

493
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:33,068
And you kept totally legit, clean books?

494
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:38,046
Sure. I would keep the records for a year
and then I'd send it back to him.

495
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,140
But that's not unusual.

496
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:43,978
I had a lot of clients from my old firm
who did the same thing.

497
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:48,047
They sent their taxes by themselves.
It wasn't that unusual.

498
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:53,654
- So when did you realize, Mr. Green?
- About Z?

499
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,592
Five years later, maybe six, I don't know.

500
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:03,436
I started doing some of his
other businesses, all cash businesses.

501
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:06,908
Bars, restaurants, laundromats, diamonds.

502
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:12,105
I mean, when you have two or three
cash businesses, that's one thing,

503
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:15,679
but when you've got a dozen
and they're moving

504
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:20,086
tens of millions of dollars through them,
and I'm talking about 20 years ago,

505
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,921
well, that's quite a different thing.

506
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,988
I was in too deep, anyway.

507
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:30,526
I mean, he supported my entire business.
He paid me a fortune.

508
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:33,827
So when he disappeared,

509
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:38,097
I would get these packages in the mail
and send them back.

510
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,836
It didn't feel dirty.

511
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:43,777
Why should I care
if somebody else is doctoring the books?

512
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:48,382
- Why did Ziggy disappear?
- Anyone would've left.

513
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:50,719
Why's that?

514
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:57,150
Do you even know Ziggy?

515
00:44:57,795 --> 00:45:01,128
You just can't enjoy yourself,
can you, Mr. Green?

516
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:09,166
Now, I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Why did Ziggy disappear?

517
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:11,332
His daughter was killed.

518
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,376
That is heavy.

519
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:25,177
- I didn't even know he had a daughter.
- Me neither.

520
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:27,688
We've got our guy.

521
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:30,921
<i>Wake up, Peggy, wake up.</i>
<i>He's here. He's here.</i>

522
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:44,731
- I rarely see that box get opened.
- I only come by once a month.

523
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:48,073
That's quite the system.
You just keep sending the envelope?

524
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:49,577
I don't know nothing about it.

525
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,740
<i>I just do this and get a check in the mail.</i>

526
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:02,223
<i>I'm fucking bored of</i>
<i>sitting around here doing nothing.</i>

527
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:04,351
We're not doing nothing,
we're playing cards.

528
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,396
You can scratch my balls.

529
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:08,761
You guys ever hear of a guy
by the name of Harry Rusick?

530
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:11,699
- No.
- He must be an old-timer, Jimmy.

531
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,634
- Old-timer?
- From the first generation.

532
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:14,761
There was a bunch of older guys

533
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:16,931
who worked with the big guy
when he was young.

534
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,268
Rules were a lot different back then.

535
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:22,141
For one reason or another,
they'd never stay around forever.

536
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:23,270
- Well, he was telling me...
- Shut up!

537
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,109
Hey, shut up!

538
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:26,746
What the fuck are you doing?

539
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:29,047
- You could get us whacked.
- Or worse.

540
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,555
Hey, Jimmy, you get an order,
just do your shit.

541
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,181
You write it up, you send it back.

542
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:36,783
Nobody needs to hear
what color other people's shit is.

543
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:39,795
There's no gain from that. Understand?

544
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,295
Yeah. I understand.

545
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:47,360
- Who is it?
- Delivery.

546
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:58,306
- Delivery for Jimmy Vaughn.
- Yeah, that's me.

547
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:45,120
Can I help you?

548
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,795
I'm here for the arbitration.
My name is Jimmy Vaughn.

549
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:53,633
They're expecting you.
Last door at the end of the hall.

550
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:30,038
Come in.

551
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,379
Turn around.

552
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:44,986
All right.

553
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:56,555
Mr. Vaughn. Please sit down.

554
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:05,839
Mr. Vaughn, Mr. Rusick. I'm confident
you gentlemen have met before.

555
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,672
Mr. Vaughn, I know you're fairly a newbie
to this organization,

556
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,875
but at times like this,
you're going to be treated like an adult.

557
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,077
Thank you.

558
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:16,846
You received orders
to visit Mr. Rusick in prison.

559
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,353
- Is that correct?
- Yes, sir.

560
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:20,413
And what happened there?

561
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:23,960
I filed a report
documenting our conversation, sir.

562
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:27,690
Is this the aforementioned report?

563
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:28,856
Yes.

564
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:33,198
Let the record show that Mr. Vaughn
positively identified his Rusick report.

565
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:36,239
Now, Mr. Vaughn, there seems
to be a slight discrepancy in the report

566
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,706
that has proved to be quite alarming
to the organization.

567
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:40,242
What is that?

568
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:43,040
When you spoke to Mr. Rusick,
did he stress that you remain relaxed,

569
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:46,742
because that is what you wrote up,
the word "relaxed."

570
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:55,417
So what's the discrepancy?

571
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:59,762
I said "laxed."
Laxed, not relaxed. I said "laxed."

572
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:03,027
You got it? Laxed. And you said, "Got it!"

573
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:08,299
Mr. Rusick. Mr. Rusick, might I remind you
of the severe consequences you're facing?

574
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:12,933
He granted you this hearing as a courtesy.
Do not make him regret that.

575
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:18,741
Now Mr. Vaughn, did Mr. Rusick
use the word "relaxed" or the word "laxed"?

576
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:23,717
I got a wife. I got kids.

577
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:27,483
Kids.

578
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:34,259
I believe my report is accurate, sir.

579
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:40,232
Please let the record show that Mr. Vaughn
has corroborated his own conversation

580
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:41,668
of his own report with Mr. Rusick.

581
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:44,673
Therefore, Rusick directed the shipment
into Redlands Airport.

582
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:46,743
Not only did he fail to repay his debt,

583
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,677
but he wasted another $10 million
and tried to cover it with a lie.

584
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:53,773
Mr. Rusick, are you familiar
with the penalty for lying to him?

585
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:58,687
Thank you, Mr. Vaughn. You're free to go.

586
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:34,314
- Hello?
- I was told to drop off an envelope.

587
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:39,027
Yes. I heard. I'm Harry's wife.
I'm Caren Rusick.

588
00:51:41,998 --> 00:51:45,490
- Well, won't you come in?
- No, I don't wanna intrude. Please.

589
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:49,232
There's nothing to intrude on.
Just sit inside and cry.

590
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:51,901
I didn't hear from anybody.

591
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:57,574
Well, Ziggy called this morning.
He told me about this. So thoughtful.

592
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:00,815
Come in. Please.

593
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:11,086
Please, have a seat.

594
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:16,226
Can I get you anything?
Some iced tea, coffee? Maybe some cake?

595
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:21,326
No, thank you.

596
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:25,738
You'll have to excuse all the baking.
I bake when I get stressed out.

597
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:27,935
I've been pretty stressed.

598
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:30,706
I think those are the biggest cupcakes
I've ever seen.

599
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:31,838
I'll give them to you.

600
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:35,874
- You can take them all when you go.
- No, no. No, please, no.

601
00:52:47,864 --> 00:52:49,195
Sorry.

602
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:54,431
He's so sweet.
Most employers wouldn't do this.

603
00:52:57,774 --> 00:53:00,641
- Do you not even know what this is?
- No.

604
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:06,211
It's a life insurance policy
he takes out for all his long-time employees.

605
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:09,309
He says it's to ensure the family nest egg.

606
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:17,586
You mustn't be thinking about that, yet.
You're far too young.

607
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:23,929
I'm sorry. I'm so rude.
I forgot to ask you your name.

608
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:28,667
- It's Jimmy. Jimmy Vaughn.
- Jimmy.

609
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:31,598
You seem nice.

610
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:35,836
Did you ever meet Harry?

611
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:41,742
No. I don't think that I did.

612
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:47,121
He would've liked you.
You would've liked him, too, I bet.

613
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:50,449
He told great stories.

614
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:53,589
All those guys told great stories.

615
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:58,927
Harry and Ziggy, Archie and Mickey.

616
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:04,299
But nobody's even around anymore.

617
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:13,480
- Well, the thing is, people get busy, huh?
- Isn't that the truth?

618
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:28,160
This is... This is my Harry. Here.

619
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:37,535
I can assure you that he is looking down
right now from Heaven,

620
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:43,408
and he is saying to himself, "I can't wait
to meet that young man, Jimmy."

621
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:47,839
He'll thank you for what you've done.
He will.

622
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:54,113
I'm so sorry.

623
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:05,626
- And when was that?
- It was almost six months ago.

624
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:10,031
I knew I was killing him.

625
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:13,371
I mean, I basically killed him myself.

626
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:17,043
But I also knew that it was either him or me
that was leaving that room.

627
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,581
Did you hear him say, "laxed"?

628
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,215
Of course I did.

629
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:29,490
Murphy had me write up "relaxed,"

630
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:32,886
which meant Redlands Airport Los Angeles,
instead of "laxed,"

631
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,691
which meant LAX Airport.

632
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:29,745
- Two targets down. Good to go.
- Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

633
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:31,286
Move, move.

634
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:59,244
- So what do we got in there?
- Coffins.

635
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:27,608
You think the drugs are
inside these coffins?

636
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:31,841
There's only one way to find out.
Give me the crowbar, will you?

637
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:44,356
He worked for Ziggy.

638
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,394
They all worked for Ziggy. He killed them all.

639
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:56,301
- So where are the drugs?
- He doesn't have fat people work for him.

640
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:59,671
They're all in good shape.
Let me see your knife.

641
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,808
Here, hold this.

642
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:06,709
Okay.

643
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,698
They're stuffed.

644
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,407
Keep opening 'em up. Let's go. Come on.

645
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:37,776
Ziggy killed all 40 of those men
to transport his drugs to the meeting spot.

646
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:41,684
We seized about 1100 pounds
of heroin that day.

647
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:44,111
And our team won the day.

648
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:50,923
- So that's what Rusick wanted to tell Ziggy?
- No.

649
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:55,758
Rusick was in charge
of all of Ziggy's drug operations.

650
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,095
He wanted the flight to go to LAX,

651
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,897
where his two biggest contacts
were waiting.

652
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:03,632
I redirected the flight to Redlands.

653
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:09,241
He set the whole thing up
from inside a prison to repay his debt.

654
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:11,239
- His debt?
- Yeah, his debt to Ziggy.

655
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:13,976
I don't know what it was. I have no idea.

656
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:17,746
Right, but you are aware
that you didn't kill Rusick.

657
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:26,395
During a small prison riot that afternoon,

658
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:30,661
Rusick was shot square in the head
with live ammunition.

659
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:36,568
The guard,
he got a two-day paid suspension.

660
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:42,738
You're judging yourself
for your role in Rusick's death.

661
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,805
That isn't fair to you.

662
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:50,645
You chose a job, a life serving the Bureau.

663
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:55,053
The Bureau chooses for you,
because it can see the bigger picture.

664
00:59:58,294 --> 00:59:59,886
Dr. Shaw,

665
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:02,387
I shattered his family.

666
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:12,469
So Agent Cole,
you got anything new from him?

667
01:00:12,575 --> 01:00:16,136
Look, he told me the same story
of how he met Ziggy.

668
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:18,907
Same as Rusick.
A card game at Mickey Sullivan's.

669
01:00:18,982 --> 01:00:22,008
He was important.
He links them all somehow.

670
01:00:24,854 --> 01:00:29,154
Back in the day when you knew Ziggy,
did you know Mickey Sullivan?

671
01:00:31,694 --> 01:00:32,922
Yeah.

672
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:37,464
And was he a guy like Green and Rusick?

673
01:00:39,035 --> 01:00:42,698
No. He was a prick. Like Ziggy.

674
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:49,539
Agent Murphy,
I'll talk to you in the morning.

675
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:55,715
Kevin, I'm hosting this function
at the hotel tonight.

676
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:59,386
I'd appreciate it
if you'd put in an appearance.

677
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,151
Sure. Should I bring Becky?

678
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,988
Yeah, sure. See you there.

679
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:24,645
Mr. Green.

680
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:29,407
Mr. Green.

681
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,221
A little deli food?

682
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:48,760
Just what the doctor ordered, huh?

683
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,253
I figured one piece of a candy bar
in five days...

684
01:02:08,624 --> 01:02:11,115
I owed you a little bit of food.

685
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:20,562
Tomorrow we're back to story time.

686
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:28,643
- Jimmy. Jimmy, do me a favor?
- What's that?

687
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,147
Kill me.

688
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:14,089
Baby, we need to talk.

689
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:19,925
I don't wanna talk right now.
Just give me 10 minutes.

690
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:23,523
I need you to open your eyes,
so we can talk now.

691
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:31,938
If I ask for 10 minutes,
then give me 10 fucking minutes.

692
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:37,012
I go to work all day, I do all kinds of shit.

693
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:38,978
And if I come home
and I wanna be left alone,

694
01:03:39,048 --> 01:03:41,141
then I don't need you telling me
you need to talk right now.

695
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:43,811
All I want is 10 fucking minutes!

696
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:59,400
- What is it?
- There's so much.

697
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:04,105
What the fuck do you want from me?
Just tell me.

698
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:06,402
What is it? What do you want?
Talk to me. Come on.

699
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,945
What is it? What is it?
You hurt me. That's what.

700
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:16,745
I don't even recognize you anymore.

701
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:19,752
You have changed, Kevin.

702
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:23,923
I mean, first,
you don't wanna talk about the war.

703
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:27,295
Then you don't wanna talk about your job.

704
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:31,423
Then you disappear for days
and you don't wanna talk about it.

705
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:36,198
- And now, you don't wanna talk at all.
- I wonder why.

706
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:39,070
Our conversations are such a pleasure.

707
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:45,278
Now get ready
and let's get the hell out of here.

708
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,574
- Name?
- Kevin Cole and Becky Carson.

709
01:05:19,148 --> 01:05:20,342
Go on.

710
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:46,605
Every girl loves to go into a party
through the basement.

711
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:48,776
Enjoy your evening.

712
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:51,779
I wouldn't bet on it.

713
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:21,309
Listen. Let me talk to my father,
then we'll get out of here. Okay?

714
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:28,010
Figured you might want 10 minutes.

715
01:06:41,864 --> 01:06:43,525
Director Cole.

716
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,560
- Nice to see you again, Senator.
- Nice to see you, too, sir.

717
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:50,230
- How's your boy?
- He's doing very well, thank you.

718
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:54,935
Good. I've been meaning to thank him
for his service to the country.

719
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:02,081
Would you excuse me, Senator?

720
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:17,730
- That's quite the spectacle.
- Dog-and-pony show.

721
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:21,733
Now that you're getting deeper
into this operation

722
01:07:21,804 --> 01:07:24,796
and having more success
than any of us anticipated,

723
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:27,933
I think we should talk. I read your brief.

724
01:07:29,745 --> 01:07:33,579
Archie's description
of how Ziggy's whole syndicate began,

725
01:07:33,816 --> 01:07:36,979
about the card games, Mickey Sullivan.

726
01:07:37,753 --> 01:07:40,551
Yeah? You remember something about it?

727
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:43,889
Kevin,

728
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:47,428
I'm Mickey Sullivan.

729
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:52,762
What?

730
01:07:57,873 --> 01:08:01,536
I was almost 40
when I first started out at the Bureau.

731
01:08:01,977 --> 01:08:06,004
I figured I'd have to make some noise
if I was ever gonna get noticed.

732
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:11,314
There was this small-time thief,
ran these scams, dealt mostly in diamonds.

733
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:15,279
I volunteered to go undercover
to get close to him,

734
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:20,457
see where it would lead me.
And I used the alias Mickey Sullivan.

735
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:29,165
Ziggy posed no real national danger
at that time, so I became friends with him.

736
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:34,899
He used to invite me along
on some of his endeavors,

737
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:38,678
to meet his contacts.

738
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:41,542
At the same time
I was bringing new people to him,

739
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:45,142
people I thought would be sloppy
and easy to track.

740
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:48,554
- Like Rusick and Green.
- Yeah.

741
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:53,525
Only he had this way into them.

742
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:58,764
He'd weave his web,
and before I'd even realize,

743
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:00,429
they were caught up in it.

744
01:09:00,536 --> 01:09:03,505
That happened to Rusick, Green,
lot of people.

745
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:06,006
So you helped build his empire.

746
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:07,906
- No.
- No?

747
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:11,942
I kind of counseled him so that
his organization would have a structure

748
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:14,709
that the FBI would be familiar with.

749
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:19,912
No, he wound up taking over all the crooks

750
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:23,185
that I was initially just using him to meet.

751
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:26,593
I had no idea he'd get this big.

752
01:09:29,231 --> 01:09:33,361
Sometimes you help create the very enemies
you end up fighting.

753
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:43,774
But Rusick talked about Mickey Sullivan
like he was still around.

754
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:48,082
I still pull a few strings now and then,

755
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:53,080
when I think it's in the best interest
of the Bureau. Like Rusick.

756
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:58,787
He was in charge of Ziggy's drug trafficking,
so I moved some money around

757
01:09:58,894 --> 01:10:01,954
in one of his accounts
to get Ziggy's attention,

758
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:05,465
see if I could force Rusick
into revealing his contacts.

759
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:07,160
So Rusick dies.

760
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:11,800
That's the price you pay
for doing business with Ziggy.

761
01:10:12,775 --> 01:10:14,640
Did you frame Green?

762
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:21,412
No. And unfortunately I don't know who did.

763
01:10:23,752 --> 01:10:26,186
Why are you telling me tonight?

764
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:29,623
Why haven't you told me before?

765
01:10:31,026 --> 01:10:34,086
Because I wasn't sure how you'd take it.

766
01:10:34,163 --> 01:10:36,097
And I wanted to explain
all this to you myself

767
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:38,793
without any other agents involved.

768
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:46,430
He's never contacted
any of the people we sent in.

769
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:50,170
He's taken a special interest in you, Kevin.

770
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:56,812
- How many other agents have you sent in?
- Oh, many.

771
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:02,523
Most don't make it past the coffee shop.
Some end up dead.

772
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:09,623
You wanted this,
in spite of my objections, remember?

773
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:21,176
Just give us a second.

774
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:28,374
How long have you been with Becky?

775
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:32,550
A long time, Dad.

776
01:11:33,155 --> 01:11:37,091
It's important to have a life
outside of the Bureau, Kevin.

777
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:40,754
- Something that's completely your own.
- Yeah.

778
01:11:44,867 --> 01:11:47,893
It's just tough trusting anybody right now.

779
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:55,976
You haven't told her anything, have you?

780
01:11:56,078 --> 01:11:58,239
- Of course not.
- Good.

781
01:11:59,948 --> 01:12:03,475
You don't ever wanna get her involved
in any of this.

782
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:07,785
That's how people get hurt.

783
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:16,063
You said something the other day.

784
01:12:16,131 --> 01:12:20,124
You said that I wasn't trained
to mercilessly torture people.

785
01:12:21,103 --> 01:12:23,571
I was trained to torture people.

786
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:26,603
But what they don't teach you, Dr. Shaw,

787
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:30,111
is what it's like to look
into another man's eyes

788
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:32,670
as you tear his fingernails out.

789
01:12:33,482 --> 01:12:35,473
That they don't teach you.

790
01:12:35,584 --> 01:12:38,451
Or what it must feel like

791
01:12:41,256 --> 01:12:46,023
to be there in that moment when
your father tells you he's Mickey Sullivan.

792
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:52,363
- What'd it feel like?
- How would it feel?

793
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:58,129
I've killed a man who used to be his friend,

794
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,198
and now I'm out there every day
slowly killing another man

795
01:13:00,309 --> 01:13:02,675
who used to be his friend,
in order to catch another guy

796
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:04,973
who used to be his friend.

797
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:11,519
Feel like he's got a lot of bad friends.

798
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:17,790
You know how most kids grow up
thinking their father's a...

799
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:20,124
I don't know, a business person?

800
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:22,823
And then one day that boy becomes a man,

801
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:26,129
and he goes to work at the same office
as his father.

802
01:13:26,201 --> 01:13:30,865
And one day he opens his father's drawer,
and he finds a dirty magazine.

803
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:37,042
- So?
- I knew my father had secrets, Dr. Shaw.

804
01:13:37,312 --> 01:13:41,749
But for the first time in my life,
I have no idea who he is.

805
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:50,325
- And would you want that for your son?
- No.

806
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:55,194
I would want my son to go into work,
open my drawer

807
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:57,994
and find a filthy, dirty magazine.

808
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:02,564
Is that what your father would want
for your son?

809
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:05,572
I don't really care what my father wants.

810
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:09,703
- What about what your mother would want?
- My mother?

811
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:18,083
My mother would want whatever it was
that made him happy.

812
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:23,851
She'd probably want
what would make you happy, as well.

813
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:28,921
What about that?
That thing that would make you happy?

814
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:36,970
If you could choose only one thing
that would make you happy,

815
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:39,040
what would you choose?

816
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:08,429
Hey.

817
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:12,500
Hey.

818
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:31,452
It's too late.

819
01:15:33,862 --> 01:15:35,625
What's too late?

820
01:15:36,498 --> 01:15:39,956
You don't act the same anymore, Kevin.
It's been a while.

821
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:41,627
Becky, please.

822
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:45,298
Ever since you came home
with that scar on your neck.

823
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:48,366
You never did tell me, what is that scar?

824
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:51,277
I wanna make things work.

825
01:15:51,346 --> 01:15:54,281
You just got to give me some time
to finish things at work, that's all.

826
01:15:54,349 --> 01:15:56,374
Just give me some time.

827
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:01,021
- I want a normal life again.
- What's normal to you, Kevin?

828
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:05,724
A family.

829
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:10,192
You know, barbecues at the house,
poker in the basement.

830
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:13,599
I want those things, too.

831
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:18,365
I just don't believe you can
walk away from your work.

832
01:16:36,024 --> 01:16:39,221
I called my sister.
I'm gonna go stay with her.

833
01:16:42,297 --> 01:16:44,527
You're staying here, Becky.

834
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:54,269
Baby.

835
01:16:56,878 --> 01:16:58,470
Don't leave me.

836
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:06,413
I love you, Kevin.

837
01:17:10,425 --> 01:17:11,983
You know that.

838
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:20,962
I just can't live like this anymore.

839
01:17:22,337 --> 01:17:24,430
Becky, you're all I have.

840
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:37,910
Please don't.

841
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:44,024
Just... Just let me go.

842
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:49,422
I'm so sorry I hurt you.

843
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,896
I don't understand.
Why do I have to give another statement?

844
01:18:28,003 --> 01:18:29,698
I've already told the police what happened.

845
01:18:29,805 --> 01:18:32,137
The FBI gets involved
in missing person cases

846
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:35,574
where we have reason to believe
the individual might've crossed state lines.

847
01:18:35,677 --> 01:18:39,477
- You think that he's crossed state lines?
- We don't know.

848
01:18:42,484 --> 01:18:45,078
He got up, he packed,

849
01:18:45,187 --> 01:18:47,348
he came across
and kissed me on the forehead,

850
01:18:47,422 --> 01:18:49,390
and then he walked out the door.

851
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:51,891
<i>- Did you see him walk out?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

852
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:55,753
<i>- You were awake?</i>
<i>- I was awake.</i>

853
01:18:55,864 --> 01:18:58,389
<i>I usually wake up</i>
<i>when he kisses me in the morning.</i>

854
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:01,594
Do you think that my husband is still alive?

855
01:19:03,038 --> 01:19:06,064
It's important to stay positive
at a time like this.

856
01:19:06,174 --> 01:19:10,338
Do you have any reason to believe
that my husband is still alive?

857
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:17,579
I have no proof of anything, yet.

858
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:21,514
It could be anything. He could've run away.

859
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:24,852
He could've been abducted.

860
01:19:25,127 --> 01:19:28,221
Somebody could be holding him for ransom.
It could be anything.

861
01:19:28,296 --> 01:19:32,357
<i>- Do you think that it's ransom?</i>
<i>- I don't know. It might be.</i>

862
01:19:32,968 --> 01:19:35,459
- I could pay.
- Lead her to the money, Brian.

863
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:36,867
<i>Lead her to the money.</i>

864
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:40,874
It's generally not a good idea
to negotiate with kidnappers.

865
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:46,645
But, just in case we explore that route,

866
01:19:47,482 --> 01:19:49,575
what kind of options do we have?

867
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:52,381
A lot. I could get a lot of money.

868
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:54,319
<i>My husband works for an old family friend.</i>

869
01:19:54,422 --> 01:19:55,980
- I could contact him.
<i>- How's that?</i>

870
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:59,288
I write a letter and I mail it
to his corporate post office box.

871
01:19:59,394 --> 01:20:01,294
<i>Within a week I get a response.</i>

872
01:20:01,396 --> 01:20:03,956
- A week.
- It's too bad.

873
01:20:04,733 --> 01:20:07,293
He called me this morning,
asked me if I needed anything.

874
01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:08,461
Who called her?

875
01:20:08,537 --> 01:20:09,629
Ziggy.

876
01:20:09,704 --> 01:20:13,470
Wanted to know if there was anything
he could do for her.

877
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:16,709
- What do we do next?
- We wait.

878
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:20,007
He'll tell us what to do.

879
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:34,690
You notice how the towel's wet at the top
and dry at the bottom?

880
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:38,394
When I light this towel on fire,
your feet will burn,

881
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:42,960
but the dampness in your shins
will keep the blood moving in your legs.

882
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:46,007
It's an old trick they use in the desert.

883
01:20:48,977 --> 01:20:50,911
- I think I know something.
- I can't hear you. What'd you say?

884
01:20:51,012 --> 01:20:52,070
- I think I know something!
- I can't hear you!

885
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:53,204
- I know something!
- What?

886
01:20:53,315 --> 01:20:55,044
I know something!

887
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:57,712
Now listen to me.
I have no way of proving this,

888
01:20:57,819 --> 01:21:00,049
but I think Mickey Sullivan is behind all this.

889
01:21:00,155 --> 01:21:01,850
Now listen to me. Hear me out.

890
01:21:01,923 --> 01:21:04,721
There's not that many of us left
from the old days.

891
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:07,727
There's Ziggy, Mickey and me.

892
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:12,527
I would never do what you're talking about.
Z certainly wouldn't do it.

893
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:15,229
Harry's dead. That leaves Mickey.

894
01:21:26,681 --> 01:21:29,775
You just bought yourself
some time, Mr. Green.

895
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:44,862
- Hello.
<i>- Good afternoon, Jimmy.</i>

896
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:47,967
- Good afternoon.
<i>- I just watched the feed.</i>

897
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:51,937
<i>I liked where you were going.</i>
<i>Now go back and burn his feet.</i>

898
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:55,237
Sir, the technique was working.
He's talking about Mickey Sullivan.

899
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:56,709
<i>I don't give a shit.</i>

900
01:21:56,778 --> 01:22:01,272
<i>I'm directing you to go back into the vault</i>
<i>and burn him. Now.</i>

901
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:05,049
- But then he won't trust me.
<i>- Who gives a fuck if he trusts you?</i>

902
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:09,716
<i>Remember what I told you.</i>
<i>You have 10 seconds to make up your mind.</i>

903
01:22:13,495 --> 01:22:15,793
<i>Five seconds, Mr. Vaughn.</i>

904
01:22:15,897 --> 01:22:18,889
<i>There can easily be two bodies</i>
<i>hanging in the vault tonight.</i>

905
01:22:18,967 --> 01:22:20,127
Fuck.

906
01:22:20,802 --> 01:22:24,966
- Hey, what's up Jimmy? Back so soon?
- Come back for this, bitch?

907
01:22:28,677 --> 01:22:32,636
I owed you that! You hear me?
I owed you that.

908
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:37,345
Fuck. Bitch.

909
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:42,782
Oh, God! Oh, God!

910
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:52,794
- Where'd you get that?
- A lady gave them to me.

911
01:22:55,003 --> 01:22:56,971
Are they okay to eat?

912
01:23:07,115 --> 01:23:10,016
- It's a strange world, Mo.
- You think so?

913
01:23:12,687 --> 01:23:14,382
Yeah. I think so.

914
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:18,721
Hey, Jimmy. So do I.

915
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:32,063
Stand up, Jimmy.

916
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:35,165
Mo, couldn't you wait
until I was fucking through?

917
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:37,234
Jimmy, please stand up.

918
01:23:37,879 --> 01:23:40,507
- Are you through?
- Yeah, I'm through.

919
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:43,746
- Turn and face Larry.
- Slowly, asshole.

920
01:23:47,822 --> 01:23:49,653
Put your hands out.

921
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:56,421
What's the matter, guys,
don't like the cupcakes?

922
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:58,362
Shut the fuck up.

923
01:24:02,837 --> 01:24:04,702
What's going on, Mo?

924
01:24:13,348 --> 01:24:15,043
Well, that was easy enough.

925
01:24:28,596 --> 01:24:31,724
Hello? Hello.

926
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:35,131
Who's there? Hello?

927
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:39,805
Please, I'm doing my best.

928
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:42,604
If I've done something wrong,
just tell me, please.

929
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:45,270
I'm doing my best. Do you hear me?

930
01:24:48,216 --> 01:24:51,617
<i>Mr. Vaughn, please don't be frightened.</i>

931
01:24:52,053 --> 01:24:54,214
<i>I'm the one you've been waiting to meet.</i>

932
01:24:54,289 --> 01:24:58,089
<i>- I am Ziggy.</i>
- Ziggy?

933
01:24:58,827 --> 01:25:01,091
<i>This is a happy occasion.</i>

934
01:25:01,162 --> 01:25:03,494
<i>One you will look back upon</i>
<i>many years from now</i>

935
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:06,066
<i>and be very proud of, I'm sure.</i>

936
01:25:07,335 --> 01:25:09,826
<i>It is time for your initiation.</i>

937
01:25:10,572 --> 01:25:15,236
<i>You should know this is the closest</i>
<i>you will ever come to me, Mr. Vaughn.</i>

938
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:17,835
<i>And there are a lot of people</i>
<i>who would risk their lives</i>

939
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:20,005
<i>to stand even this close.</i>

940
01:25:21,916 --> 01:25:26,114
<i>I know you've seen the mark of initiation</i>
<i>on all of my recruits.</i>

941
01:25:27,822 --> 01:25:32,259
<i>I am about to slice open your neck,</i>
<i>but do not think about the pain.</i>

942
01:25:33,261 --> 01:25:35,525
<i>Think about the gratitude you feel for me,</i>

943
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:39,122
<i>since I protected you</i>
<i>by not cutting open your vein.</i>

944
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:42,335
<i>Do you feel grateful?</i>

945
01:25:43,037 --> 01:25:45,335
<i>- Are you sure?</i>
- Yeah.

946
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:49,372
Yeah. I'm sure.

947
01:25:54,182 --> 01:25:56,309
<i>Embrace the pain, Jimmy.</i>

948
01:25:57,785 --> 01:25:59,719
<i>This is a celebration.</i>

949
01:26:03,892 --> 01:26:07,555
I am grateful. I am grateful.

950
01:26:09,197 --> 01:26:12,360
<i>From the bottom of my heart,</i>
<i>congratulations.</i>

951
01:26:22,043 --> 01:26:23,670
Son of a bitch.

952
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:27,672
- Rough day in the vault?
- No, it was a bed of roses.

953
01:26:27,749 --> 01:26:31,014
Hey, hey. Both of you.
Hey, we heard the call.

954
01:26:31,252 --> 01:26:33,846
He's making us look like amateurs!

955
01:26:37,926 --> 01:26:39,985
So what do you suggest?

956
01:26:42,764 --> 01:26:44,925
- Let's surface him.
- How?

957
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:48,093
Let's get our hands on something
he actually cares about. Force his hand.

958
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:49,761
- Like what?
- Like Green.

959
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:53,534
Last time I acted on advice like that,
Ziggy's daughter got killed.

960
01:26:53,608 --> 01:26:56,338
- What'd you say?
- Ziggy's daughter.

961
01:26:56,411 --> 01:26:59,107
- Yeah, her name's Tally. Yeah, I know.
- That's right.

962
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:01,444
We had a plan to take down Ziggy, too.

963
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:02,846
We were gonna intercept his car

964
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:04,942
when he brought his daughter home
from school.

965
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:07,180
Only he wasn't in the car.

966
01:27:07,589 --> 01:27:11,423
The driver started shooting.
She was hit in the crossfire.

967
01:27:13,628 --> 01:27:15,027
And he went underground.

968
01:27:15,096 --> 01:27:17,587
And he never came back up again, not once.

969
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:20,361
Until you started interrogating Archie Green.

970
01:27:20,435 --> 01:27:22,903
- So that's it. Let's bring Green in.
- What?

971
01:27:22,971 --> 01:27:25,098
Let's kidnap him.
We'll hold him as state evidence.

972
01:27:25,206 --> 01:27:28,642
We even have Mickey Sullivan here
to talk to him, somebody he trusts.

973
01:27:28,743 --> 01:27:30,267
And then I'll get the word to Ziggy

974
01:27:30,378 --> 01:27:32,744
that we have the answer
for the $10 million mystery.

975
01:27:32,814 --> 01:27:35,908
It'll eat his ass up and he'll come after us.

976
01:27:35,984 --> 01:27:38,248
What do you think, sir?

977
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:40,480
- I think it's way too risky.
- Oh, come on.

978
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:43,785
Well, what if you approach Green
and reveal yourself to him,

979
01:27:43,891 --> 01:27:47,759
and he doesn't wanna turn?
What if he reveals you to Ziggy?

980
01:27:50,832 --> 01:27:54,131
Hey, don't look at me. Ultimately it's his call.

981
01:27:58,906 --> 01:28:03,104
He's gonna have me go into that vault
and kill Green, eventually.

982
01:28:05,446 --> 01:28:09,246
So try my way. My way, nobody dies.

983
01:28:29,537 --> 01:28:32,097
That's the signal. Two minutes.

984
01:28:33,041 --> 01:28:36,977
<i>Remember, we might not be the only ones</i>
<i>watching the house.</i>

985
01:28:45,787 --> 01:28:50,121
- Sir, there's a call for you.
- I told you. Tonight, no bullshit.

986
01:28:51,392 --> 01:28:53,553
Jimmy, you got a package.

987
01:29:07,975 --> 01:29:12,344
- Something wrong?
- No. Not for me.

988
01:29:16,684 --> 01:29:18,914
I guess we'll be doing
some digging tonight, huh?

989
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:23,514
Hey. I know you might not understand.
None of us do.

990
01:29:25,526 --> 01:29:29,587
But whatever you got to do, you got to do.

991
01:29:32,867 --> 01:29:34,391
Understand?

992
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:40,507
FBI! Don't move! Guns! Guns!

993
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:56,753
Jimmy!

994
01:29:57,091 --> 01:30:00,788
Jimmy, shoot the motherfuckers, man!
What're you waiting for?

995
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:03,955
You motherfucking wussy! Motherfucker.

996
01:30:10,505 --> 01:30:12,302
- Clear!
- Clear!

997
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:29,583
Kevin? Kevin?

998
01:31:33,654 --> 01:31:35,019
Mr. Green.

999
01:31:38,826 --> 01:31:40,157
Mr. Green.

1000
01:31:44,665 --> 01:31:49,602
I'm gonna try to explain something to you
that you might find hard to believe.

1001
01:31:51,672 --> 01:31:54,038
My name is not Jimmy Vaughn.

1002
01:31:57,578 --> 01:32:01,173
I'm an agent
for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

1003
01:32:01,883 --> 01:32:06,183
And I'm giving you an opportunity
to become state evidence.

1004
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:11,851
I'm gonna take you down.

1005
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:16,721
It's okay, it's okay,
I'm just gonna take you off of here.

1006
01:32:16,797 --> 01:32:19,231
Just gonna take you down, okay?

1007
01:32:20,401 --> 01:32:24,303
It's over, Mr. Green.
It's over, it's over. Come here.

1008
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:36,876
We can protect you.
And we can protect your family.

1009
01:32:38,653 --> 01:32:41,451
I'll take you in for questioning, okay?

1010
01:32:43,124 --> 01:32:45,115
Will you come with me?

1011
01:33:17,758 --> 01:33:19,282
Straight back.

1012
01:33:30,504 --> 01:33:35,100
- Why are you driving?
- Brian's gonna wrap it up. Let's go.

1013
01:33:55,029 --> 01:33:57,156
I hate silent transport.

1014
01:33:58,199 --> 01:34:00,360
It's the only way to do it.

1015
01:35:16,911 --> 01:35:21,280
- You just missed the exit.
- I'm not going back to headquarters yet.

1016
01:35:21,382 --> 01:35:23,441
Yeah? Where're we going?

1017
01:35:24,819 --> 01:35:26,719
I need some answers.

1018
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:29,716
I can't have that guy walking
into the review board

1019
01:35:29,790 --> 01:35:32,759
making allegations against me
that just aren't true.

1020
01:35:32,827 --> 01:35:37,264
If Green's allegations aren't true,
the Bureau's panel will see that.

1021
01:35:38,566 --> 01:35:42,400
You don't ever wanna put your life
in the hands of that panel.

1022
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:44,802
Where the hell are they!
They should be here by now!

1023
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:20,532
I've got a body!

1024
01:36:20,941 --> 01:36:25,776
There's another call for you, sir, from Chino.
I think you should take this.

1025
01:36:27,047 --> 01:36:28,105
What?

1026
01:36:31,318 --> 01:36:33,115
Let's get an I. D!

1027
01:36:37,958 --> 01:36:39,016
Is that Archie Green?

1028
01:36:39,493 --> 01:36:42,326
I gotta get Director Cole on the phone.

1029
01:36:43,697 --> 01:36:45,722
Yeah. Yeah.

1030
01:36:47,835 --> 01:36:51,032
I know, Murphy. I'll tell you about it later.

1031
01:36:51,739 --> 01:36:54,401
I said I'd tell you about it later.

1032
01:36:55,676 --> 01:36:58,201
I'll be back as soon as I'm done.

1033
01:37:00,581 --> 01:37:03,414
Murphy, that's not important right now.

1034
01:37:04,919 --> 01:37:06,216
Murphy.

1035
01:37:07,555 --> 01:37:08,749
What?

1036
01:37:15,196 --> 01:37:18,563
You know I don't respect men
who carry guns.

1037
01:37:28,108 --> 01:37:31,407
- Hello, Mickey.
- Hello, Ziggy.

1038
01:37:33,414 --> 01:37:36,611
You have no idea
how long I've waited for this.

1039
01:37:37,218 --> 01:37:40,847
Years of planning. Watching Kevin grow up.

1040
01:37:41,589 --> 01:37:44,217
The sins of the father, huh, Ziggy?

1041
01:37:46,961 --> 01:37:48,724
Kevin for Tally?

1042
01:37:50,264 --> 01:37:51,788
That's right.

1043
01:37:53,868 --> 01:37:57,395
Don't do this. I'm the one you want.

1044
01:37:59,273 --> 01:38:01,400
So, take your shot.

1045
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:07,605
- I'm right here.
- You're not enough, Jack!

1046
01:38:11,051 --> 01:38:14,714
- You ordered me to torture you.
- And you did very well.

1047
01:38:16,457 --> 01:38:19,620
You see, when you lose a child, Kevin,

1048
01:38:22,396 --> 01:38:24,296
you lose everything.

1049
01:38:27,101 --> 01:38:30,832
When I lost Tally, nothing else mattered.

1050
01:38:32,339 --> 01:38:35,399
You're about to learn how that feels, Jack.

1051
01:38:36,443 --> 01:38:39,173
Looking back, I'm glad I tortured you.

1052
01:38:44,818 --> 01:38:49,278
No, Kevin. I tortured you.

1053
01:38:55,829 --> 01:38:56,921
No!

1054
01:38:57,865 --> 01:39:01,164
Dad. Dad, breathe, breathe.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

1055
01:39:01,268 --> 01:39:03,429
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

1056
01:39:05,639 --> 01:39:06,799
Dad.

1057
01:39:11,979 --> 01:39:16,006
Jack, that was a very unselfish thing to do.
You surprise me.

1058
01:39:18,352 --> 01:39:20,377
Looks like I win again.

1059
01:39:23,324 --> 01:39:25,519
This is the game we have chosen
to play, Kevin.

1060
01:39:25,626 --> 01:39:28,652
Whose side do you wanna be on,
his or mine?

1061
01:39:34,234 --> 01:39:36,134
There are those eyes.

1062
01:39:36,570 --> 01:39:40,165
I recognized it
the first time you came into the vault.

1063
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:42,367
You've got what it takes.

1064
01:39:43,077 --> 01:39:45,705
Think about it. How's it look?

1065
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:50,007
Your father brought Archie Green
to a remote location.

1066
01:39:50,084 --> 01:39:53,520
Mickey Sullivan died.
Archie Green went free.

1067
01:39:53,587 --> 01:39:55,020
Even in your own reports,

1068
01:39:55,089 --> 01:39:58,991
I bet your father was still Mickey Sullivan
until the end.

1069
01:40:00,527 --> 01:40:03,018
Who's gonna believe you, Kevin?

1070
01:40:04,565 --> 01:40:07,864
I watched you work me over.
I watched your eyes.

1071
01:40:08,335 --> 01:40:10,360
It was all preparation.

1072
01:40:11,905 --> 01:40:15,363
Admit it,
there's a little bit of me inside of you.

1073
01:40:35,062 --> 01:40:36,893
We're nothing alike.

1074
01:40:55,315 --> 01:40:57,408
We read over your report, Agent Cole.

1075
01:40:57,484 --> 01:41:01,818
We need some time to corroborate the story
for our investigation.

1076
01:41:01,922 --> 01:41:05,221
Kevin, listen, this is gonna be a paid leave.

1077
01:41:05,626 --> 01:41:09,392
Use the time to put all this behind you.
Clear your head.

1078
01:41:09,797 --> 01:41:12,766
You're no good to us right now as you are.

1079
01:41:13,233 --> 01:41:16,828
Agent Cole, can we please have your badge
and your gun?

1080
01:41:30,451 --> 01:41:33,909
Anything else you wanna add for us
to keep in mind?

1081
01:41:35,989 --> 01:41:37,820
My father was clean.

1082
01:41:38,459 --> 01:41:43,192
And the only reason why that maniac knew
that my father wouldn't bring him in,

1083
01:41:43,297 --> 01:41:47,097
is because my father was afraid of standing
in this room in front of you.

1084
01:41:47,167 --> 01:41:49,533
And Ziggy knew that.
You know that, Murphy.

1085
01:41:49,636 --> 01:41:53,936
We all know Jack was a good guy.
We just need some time to prove it.

1086
01:41:54,007 --> 01:41:57,306
Standard procedure. Trust the panel.

1087
01:42:02,449 --> 01:42:03,677
Kevin.

1088
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:08,481
Job
well done.

1089
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:39,485
- Hello.
<i>- I got a letter from Ziggy.</i>

1090
01:42:39,553 --> 01:42:44,007
<i>I'm supposed to answer to you.</i>
<i>Am I speaking to the right person?</i>

1091
