2
00:00:28,977 --> 00:00:31,114
- Good morning and welcome to the new school year,

3
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,833
Bueller high school students.

4
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,926
Whoa, Bueller reds!

5
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,454
This is going to be the best school year yet.

7
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:43,502
Today's quote of the day comes from
sophomore Scott Pruitt.

8
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,463
"The difference between a stumbling block
and a stepping stone

9
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,340
is how high you raise your foot."

10
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,800
Thank you, Scott.

11
00:00:50,282 --> 00:00:51,607
And because we've used your quote,

12
00:00:51,632 --> 00:00:53,845
you will receive a voucher for one free lunch

13
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,359
to be used in our school cafeteria.

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,707
All incoming freshmen will be happy to know

15
00:01:01,707 --> 00:01:04,439
that the year-long hazing tradition
has been shortened

16
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,608
due to the dramatic number of students

17
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,276
who transferred last year.

18
00:01:13,751 --> 00:01:15,926
Cheerleading tryouts will be
after school at five

19
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,661
and this year are co-ed

20
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,545
become a cheerleader.

21
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:22,311
Our football team also needs your support.

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,293
Speaking of support,

23
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:25,961
today's special person of the day

24
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:28,922
is our star quarterback Connor Tucker.

25
00:01:29,185 --> 00:01:31,137
As you know, Connor led our football team

26
00:01:31,137 --> 00:01:33,026
to victory many times last year,

27
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,720
but unfortunately he broke his leg

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,633
in our state championship game win over Rydel High.

29
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,299
On doctor's orders,

30
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,269
Connor will be sidelined
for the whole season this year

31
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:44,855
and as a result he'll be spending
his senior year

32
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,251
just like the rest of us,

33
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,233
watching from the sidelines.

34
00:01:48,417 --> 00:01:50,819
it's going to be a tough year for
Buehler High School's favorite.

35
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,051
Connor, we want you to know

36
00:01:53,241 --> 00:01:55,073
that we stand behind you.

37
00:01:55,073 --> 00:02:15,052
[Music]

38
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,936
- Mr. Sansberry,

39
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:27,522
you are partnerless no longer.

40
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,904
- Hi, Berty

41
00:02:35,204 --> 00:02:36,406
- Hi.

42
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,160
- What's up?

43
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:41,995
- Today...

44
00:02:52,664 --> 00:02:54,257
When baking a cake,

45
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,385
your most important tool is...

46
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,656
- The temperature of the oven?

47
00:02:59,481 --> 00:03:00,764
- Wrong

48
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,148
The whisk

49
00:03:03,148 --> 00:03:04,893
- What are you doing here?

50
00:03:06,944 --> 00:03:09,408
- I want to learn how to cook

51
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,443
Yeah!
- Right.

52
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,822
The school'star quarterback suddenly

53
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,532
has a burning desire to

54
00:03:18,722 --> 00:03:21,087
be the next Gordon Ramsay.

55
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,328
This class is for girls.

56
00:03:23,731 --> 00:03:25,831
Are you sure this isn't just
some screwed up way

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,416
to pick up girls?

58
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,926
- Hey, come on.

59
00:03:29,926 --> 00:03:32,354
Do I look like I need help
picking up girls?

60
00:03:32,632 --> 00:03:34,965
Besides, if this class is just for girls, then

61
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,217
why are you here?

62
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:40,762
- I...

63
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,389
I want to be a chef

64
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,104
- Well chef,

65
00:03:49,588 --> 00:03:50,801
I think you should reconsider

66
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:52,579
some of those sexist attitudes you have

67
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:54,067
 towards who should be in the kitchen then.

68
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,986
Here, help me out, will you?

69
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,241
- Okay, once.

70
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,414
Just this once.
- Yeah, sure.

71
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,919
No any time now, really.

72
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,799
- There.

73
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,802
- How do I look?

74
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:23,763
- Okay class,

75
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,557
today we're also going to learn

76
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,934
how to bake chocolate chip cookies.

77
00:04:44,635 --> 00:04:46,036
- How you feel?

78
00:04:46,738 --> 00:04:47,996
- Okay.

79
00:04:48,262 --> 00:04:50,703
- So, why are you really taking cooking?

80
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,126
- Hmmm....

81
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,087
You see, I broke my leg...
- Yeah.

82
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,507
- So, now I can't play football

83
00:04:59,137 --> 00:05:00,759
It's pretty easy A.

84
00:05:02,017 --> 00:05:04,144
- It's not going to be an easy A.

85
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,390
If you wanted an easy A,
you should have gone off for choir.

86
00:05:07,926 --> 00:05:09,692
- Oh yeah. I...

87
00:05:09,913 --> 00:05:12,554
I had a really good reason for
not doing that

88
00:05:12,816 --> 00:05:14,491
- And what was that?

89
00:05:15,245 --> 00:05:16,650
- Can't sing.

90
00:05:17,575 --> 00:05:19,461
- Okay
- Hey, Jayden!

91
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,446
- Hey Samantha, come here.

92
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,031
- Trinity, her name is...

93
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,908
Hi Trinity
- Hi Connor

94
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,954
- Okay

95
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:31,832
- You know...

96
00:05:31,857 --> 00:05:34,057
it's rude not to know people's names.

97
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,753
- Noted.

98
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:45,006
- There she is... My baby.

99
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,847
- Yeah... Yeah I know that car.

100
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,267
Everyone knows that car.

101
00:05:50,521 --> 00:05:52,852
Prime parking spot too.
- Yeah.

102
00:05:53,878 --> 00:05:55,529
And it's noticeable.

103
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:02,000
Bueller red
- Go bears!

104
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,733
- Oh yeah

105
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,944
- Hey, you lost that game.

106
00:06:01,984 --> 00:06:03,764
- Yeah, I broke my leg.

107
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,490
- You still lost.

108
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,325
- Don't be a dick.

109
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,582
- So, how many girls have carried these bucks?

110
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,929
- Hundreds.

111
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,557
- Wow!
- Yeah.

112
00:06:32,628 --> 00:06:34,350
- So, you need a ride?

113
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,230
- Yeah. you're gonna drive me with

114
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,190
a busted leg and

115
00:06:39,647 --> 00:06:41,318
this thing?

116
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,217
- This thing? Yeah.

117
00:06:43,072 --> 00:06:46,031
You know this baby has four...
- Yeah,  411 hp,

118
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,797
6.2 liter v8...

119
00:06:49,797 --> 00:06:52,061
uh... hill descent control system,

120
00:06:52,228 --> 00:06:55,332
automatic locking rear differentials and

121
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:58,126
an upgraded three-link suspension

122
00:06:59,613 --> 00:07:01,176
with bottle shocks.

123
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,506
Did I miss anything?

124
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,592
I mean... uh besides it being

125
00:07:05,795 --> 00:07:07,886
bad for the environment.

126
00:07:08,482 --> 00:07:10,323
- Yeah, smart ass!

127
00:07:10,323 --> 00:07:13,224
It also has an integrated rear view camera system
- Ah....

128
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:16,019
- Got me

129
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,352
- So you know about cars,
where does that come from?

130
00:07:19,931 --> 00:07:21,316
- Brothers,

131
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:23,485
five of them.

132
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,082
- So you need a ride or...?

133
00:07:30,387 --> 00:07:33,226
- No thanks. I got choir practice.

134
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,456
- Cool. See you tomorrow.

135
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,459
Yeah
- Not if I see you first.

136
00:08:02,484 --> 00:08:03,942
- Shit!

137
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:14,536
♫ Aaahhh aaahhhh ♫

138
00:08:17,147 --> 00:08:20,041
♫ Aaahhh aaahhhh ♫

139
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,597
- Hi, Connor.

140
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,891
- Hey, Kara.

141
00:08:39,544 --> 00:08:41,730
- Can we help you, Mr. Tucker?

142
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,540
- Not really.

143
00:08:45,743 --> 00:08:47,890
Mr. Sansbury over there can.

144
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,653
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

145
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,849
- Okay. Try it again.

146
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,612
- Hey, thanks man.

147
00:09:31,232 --> 00:09:33,156
- You're welcome, man.

148
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,911
- So, what's your deal?

149
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,372
- My deal?

150
00:09:44,076 --> 00:09:46,169
- Yeah, I mean like are...

151
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,004
are you gay?

152
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,344
- Why? Because I'm in the choir?

153
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,554
- Nah man, I'm just asking

154
00:09:57,971 --> 00:10:00,016
- Is that what people around school are saying?

155
00:10:07,127 --> 00:10:08,525
- I've heard it.

156
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:14,656
So... are you?

157
00:10:17,962 --> 00:10:19,577
- Very much.

158
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,331
Does that bother you?

159
00:10:23,418 --> 00:10:24,874
No, no!

160
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,584
Hmm... I mean

161
00:10:26,681 --> 00:10:29,170
Live and let live, I say. Right?

162
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:33,216
- You know, you're the first person to ask me.

163
00:10:33,687 --> 00:10:35,510
- Really?

164
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,934
Do you have a boyfriend?

165
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,187
- Nope.

166
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,398
Not yet.

167
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,667
- So, how do you know you're gay?

168
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,121
- You just do.

169
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,971
Do you need a girlfriend to know you're straight?

170
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,203
Bingo!

171
00:11:03,602 --> 00:11:05,415
- Fair enough.

172
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,276
So do you need a ride?

173
00:11:13,265 --> 00:11:15,209
- Are you sure that's what you want to ask me?

174
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:16,759
- Yeah, man.

175
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,054
- Okay, dude.

176
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,436
- Do you want to watch a movie tomorrow night?

177
00:11:31,902 --> 00:11:33,736
- I'm moving

178
00:11:33,998 --> 00:11:36,188
On a saturday night?
- Yeah.

179
00:11:36,412 --> 00:11:38,622
- It looks like a date... Ah, ah

180
00:11:38,756 --> 00:11:40,753
- No. It's two guys going to watch a movie.

181
00:11:40,778 --> 00:11:42,285
I'm asking you to hang out with me

182
00:11:42,349 --> 00:11:44,184
and watch a movie tomorrow night.
- Hmm, hmmm...

183
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,956
You're asking me on a date

184
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,418
on saturday... night.

185
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,608
- Dude, I'm asking you to a movie.

186
00:11:52,608 --> 00:11:54,522
Do you want to go or not?

- First prom starts at seven

372
00:27:37,563 --> 00:27:40,284
Dude, did she actually say she was coming?

373
00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:42,769
Did she give you a definitive yes?

374
00:27:43,542 --> 00:27:46,540
- I don't know, I don't remember.

375
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,917
 - Maybe she's lost

376
00:27:49,342 --> 00:27:51,170
Maybe she lost your phone

377
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:55,432
- Maybe she wasn't coming in the first place?

00:27:55,748 --> 00:28:21,491

393
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:59,285
We missed three movies because
you didn't listen to me

394
00:28:59,285 --> 00:29:00,650
