1
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:50,583
Force!  Here we go!

2
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:57,958
- Can you use that?
- Your father taught me that.

3
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,041
Ok, this way!

4
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:08,750
[woman] My dad always
wanted me to spend more

5
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:11,375
time with my mom but I
doubt he had that in mind.

6
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:05,625
[Nikki] Dear friends and new
readers, I'm Nikki and this is my blog.

7
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:09,416
After my father's recent death, I
was snatched away from my friends

8
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,208
and ended up in this horrible
situation that I cannot control.

9
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,416
Now, I'm 10,000 meters high,
on a direct flight to the Czech

10
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,458
Republic, a country I don't
know, forced to live with Eve

11
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,541
the woman who brought me into the world.

12
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:27,000
I know nothing about her
except for some news read online.

13
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:32,083
I will miss all of you and
our amazing adventures.

14
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:35,916
Horseback riding, walks, days at
the beach and everything in between.

15
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,500
I'm sure I'll have
tons of meaningless

16
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:42,583
adventures to share
with you on this blog.

17
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,625
Eve is a scientist.

18
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:56,166
Dad told me that since he was in
school he wanted to improve the world.

19
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,000
[tv] We are located in the Benesov
District, in the Czech Republic,

20
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:13,000
where citizens have relied
on hydroelectricity for 60 years

21
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:17,333
generated by the Ceb dam, but
now there is great news on the horizon.

22
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:21,666
It is called Helios.  We are in
the Promethean Kinetics lab

23
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,958
with Dr. Carter, known for
her commitment to development

24
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,625
of Third World Countries,
the Helios project.

25
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:31,083
We are far from the water
collection facilities in Africa.

26
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,333
Can you tell us a little about this adventure?

27
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:37,833
[Eve] I've always been interested in
new sources of sustainable energy.

28
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:41,875
My team and I have developed
Helios, a particular mixture of

29
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:45,291
gases extracted from the
surface layer of the earth's crust.

30
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:50,875
This combined with hydrogen allows
combustion without the emission of waste.

31
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:55,416
This happens at a depth
of 70 meters thanks to a

32
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,125
high-power conversion
turbine system we call Medulla.

33
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,500
Why the Czech Republic in particular?

34
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:04,791
Europe is full of abandoned coal
mines and we want to recycle them.

35
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:09,333
Our pipe network extends between
coal mines across the country.

36
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,416
Coal?

37
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:15,583
It is a new 100% safe substance

38
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:19,166
and it is pure energy produced by the planet.

39
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,833
It looks like the fracturing process that has
caused serious problems in the United States.

40
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:28,375
It is a new procedure,
completely different from fracturing.

41
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:31,250
We have achieved splendid results.

42
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:35,250
There are still those who say you are
exporting a toxic practice from America.

43
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:41,875
Promethean Kinetics or... PK.
It is not an American company.

44
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:48,041
Okay, but there is no documentation
on who is actually funding the project.

45
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:51,833
What I can tell you is that everyone
involved in the project only cares

46
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:56,750
about one thing, the health and
safety of the planet for all of us.

47
00:04:56,833 --> 00:05:00,291
- Thank you, Dr. Carter.
- Imagine, thanks to you.

48
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:05,375
[pc] We continue with the debate between
Russia and the United States on oil in Ukraine.

49
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,916
- [Nikki] Who would you be?
- [man] Henrich.

50
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:25,833
My wife and I own the house
where your mother lives.  Here.

51
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:34,500
You and Eve were arrested on that
Greenpeace ship in Antarctica, right?

52
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,791
A long time ago!

53
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,208
So, are you sleeping with Eve?

54
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:47,125
Thing?  No, I'm married, I told you!

55
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:50,583
- Her name is Olivia.  Now, you will meet her.
- Agree.

56
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,416
[Nikki] As usual, Eve
has let me down again.

57
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,791
In the picture your mother
has, you look younger.

58
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,625
My mother?  I call her Eve.

59
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:41,000
You know, she was very sorry
she couldn't have come here today.

60
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:46,125
Let me guess.
Absurd times, time has

61
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,250
flown away, fire,
flames and all the rest.

62
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,250
Absurd times, I think.

63
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,833
[Henrich] This is a
new chapter in your life

64
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,291
Leave the past behind
and live in the moment.

65
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,375
[Nikki] Yes, right!

66
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:11,500
[Nikki] What could I expect from the
woman who abandoned my father and me

67
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:16,000
12 years ago.  Now, I am
stuck with her until I am 18.

68
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:26,333
[Henrich] We're almost there
and there's a surprise at home too.

69
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:29,708
- [Henrich] You will like it for sure.
- [Nikki] I doubt it.

70
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,125
It seems that Zeus and
Catherine like you a lot.

71
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:56,083
[Nikki] Perfect, an exciting new chapter
for my blog, Nikki and the chickens.

72
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,416
We have not met anyone
or anything for miles.

73
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,250
Who knows if Eve at least
remembers that I have diabetes!

74
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,666
I wish I could blame her.

75
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,291
But instead I inherited it from my father.

76
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,750
The doctor said
diabetes contributed

77
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,916
to the heart attack
that killed my father.

78
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,333
- Good!
- Thank you!

79
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,083
Good job!

80
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,583
- Did I go well?
- [woman] You were great!

81
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:39,333
How about?  Didn't I look too
much of an educated monkey?

82
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:42,333
You were sure of yourself,
with a little bit of caution.

83
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:48,708
Ok, thanks everyone, let's get
back to work.  So?  All in order?

84
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,250
- Negative.
- Thing?

85
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,458
It's best if you take a look here.

86
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:58,625
My God, I don't feel like activating the
system on Monday with these numbers.

87
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:04,708
- Me neighter.  Declan doesn't see it that way.
- Declan!  She always has other ideas.

88
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:09,000
- What is that?
- From me.

89
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:12,750
- Declan, won't it be celebrating soon?
- A couple of days.

90
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,833
- Maybe more than two.
- What are you talking about?

91
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,791
Tests still need to be done.

92
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,500
Just as long as these
tests say we can move on.

93
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:24,250
We will see, but in the
meantime that brings bad luck.

94
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,041
I'll put it in the cooler.

95
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:30,916
Rather, the consortium appreciated
your way of handling the press.

96
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,625
Good.  Don't you think it's time
to tell us who the investors are?

97
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,333
- I'll tell you.
- When?

98
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,583
At the right time.

99
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,500
On the Internet they are already shouting conspiracy.

100
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,541
You are in a difficult position, my dear.

101
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:48,875
Look, Europe trusts us
and we don't want to be

102
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,958
compared to a bunch of
Texan fracturing machines.

103
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:54,041
- Are you done?
- Yup.

104
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:58,166
- Well, you have some tests to do.
- Okay.

105
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,666
Pretend you don't care.  I don't want
to know where the money comes from.

106
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,916
- Law and sausages.
- Sausages?

107
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,416
You don't want to know where they come from.

108
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:14,041
Killian, could you take
a look at this for me?

109
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,125
Of course.

110
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,916
- Wait for me.
- Today is the big day, right?

111
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,416
- Today?
- Nikki.

112
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,041
Yes, Henrich picked
her up at the airport.

113
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,791
- Has Henrich gone?
- Yes, Henrich went.

114
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,791
I could not.  Ok?  I had the
interview and this afternoon is the test.

115
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,208
It's just a routine test.

116
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:34,958
I don't know what to
say to a 16 year old girl.

117
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:38,000
Try a little.
What did you do when you were 16?

118
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,208
I studied mathematics, equations,
I read chemistry magazines.

119
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,750
- Exciting.
- A party girl!

120
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,208
Go home to your daughter.

121
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,833
Okay, I'll go there when
we're done with the test.

122
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:54,208
Here we go!  Ok, come on, let's go!
Come on, come on, come on!

123
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,833
I admit, I'm excited to see her.

124
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,458
[Nikki] What is going on around here?

125
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:05,541
[Henrich] At the end of the street is
the bus stop that takes you to the city.

126
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,083
[Nikki] Good to know.

127
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,875
[Henrich] Eve will be home soon.

128
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,458
Welcome, Nikki.  I'm Olivia.

129
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,625
- Hello.
- Take a seat.

130
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,583
[Olivia] Come on!

131
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,041
The suitcase.

132
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:37,916
[Nikki] Who expected it!
No trace of Eve!

133
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,625
At least there are Zeus and Catherine.

134
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:49,541
[animal noises]

135
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,375
- Are you hungry?
- No thank you.

136
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,833
- All right.
- Stop fracturing.

137
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:07,541
Let's save the whales.
Nothing has changed.

138
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,583
- No at...
- Do you want to see your room?

139
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,833
- Yes, of course.
- This way.

140
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,041
Thank you.

141
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,416
Here we are.

142
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:26,291
Are we kidding?
Do you think I'm five?

143
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,000
I'll show you the house if you want.

144
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,458
We might as well see the rest.

145
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,458
Ok.  Follow me, I want
to show you your surprise.

146
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,666
[man] What's the matter, guys?

147
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,166
This thing has broken five
times in the past five months.

148
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,666
Relax, Killian is working on it.

149
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,833
In fact, Killian is working
on getting Dr. Carter to bed.

150
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:57,083
- Are you done there?
- Yes. Let's hope it holds up.

151
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,541
There are two of us, man.

152
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,041
Okay, let's check the resistance.

153
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:06,958
Killian, increase flow by 10%.

154
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,625
Automatic opening started.

155
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:21,916
- Pressure set at... 10%.
- Okay.

156
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:23,833
All right.

157
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,166
Let's bring it to 40.

158
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,958
Twenty, 30...

159
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:33,708
Forty.

160
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,708
[explosion]

161
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,750
[alarm]

162
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:46,291
- This was a very strong shock.
- Yeah, it must be the transformer.

163
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:52,125
- What is the pressure in Medulla?
- 42.6%.

164
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,791
- He's getting up.
- Yeah, ok, we need to decrease it.

165
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,375
Do you think it depends
on the control valves?

166
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,875
- It can be solved, right?
- Probably, but in Medulla the level was

167
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,625
to 42%.
We shouldn't be recording these results.

168
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:11,833
Okay, check both valves.
We don't continue if it doesn't resolve.

169
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:16,875
Sure, I'll go right down to take a look.
And you, go home.

170
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:18,833
Ok.

171
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:25,250
Wait a second.  A test was scheduled
for Monday.  How long will it take?

172
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,291
We need to check the
security of our systems.

173
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:32,333
Thing?  For a clogged valve?  If
we do that, we lose a lot of money.

174
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:35,541
Do you know there could be very
serious consequences, Declan?

175
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,291
Don't think like a capitalist.

176
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,500
This is not your
little science project.

177
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,500
It was probably your idea,
but it was bought and funded

178
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,833
by the people I represent.
Do you know, yes or no?

179
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:48,125
Yes, of course I know.
And they want it to work, right?

180
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:51,208
I want it ready and
they want it to work.

181
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,875
For this we have to
do other tests, Declan.

182
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,333
I'm in it too, just like you.

183
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,416
Replacing a sensor
is pretty simple.

184
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,208
So, let's get a move on
and activate the Helios.

185
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,375
No, we're not putting the
Helios into circulation now.

186
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:10,208
We will continue with the inert gases until
we ensure that all are working at their best.

187
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:14,916
- Only then can we use the Helios.
- You said it's easy to fix.

188
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:19,333
I didn't say it's easy.
Let me explain, Declan.

189
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:23,541
the Helios under pressure
is like a supercharged

190
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:24,958
flammable liquid and the
Medulla is what regulates

191
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,291
how much we pump
from coal mines.

192
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:31,083
I don't think you want to risk
the valley being destroyed.  I err?

193
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:34,041
In fact, we have a control
system and a backup system.

194
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,916
That may not work.  Let us work.

195
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,041
Agree.
Find the cause of the problem and fix it.

196
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:44,000
- Killian will.
- Killian does what you tell him to do.

197
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,291
Because Killian knows I'm right.

198
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:52,458
I don't want to make things difficult.
I have some personal matters to handle.

199
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,750
My daughter landed a little while ago.
I have to go home.

200
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,833
Look, that's how she went
today, so let's leave it alone.

201
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,166
Go to your daughter.

202
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,916
- Ok, sure?
- Come on, get out of here.

203
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,333
[cell phone rings]

204
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,833
Can we hurry?  I have an appointment.

205
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:22,583
- What does it say over there?
- 8.2.  Higher than usual, I don't like it.

206
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:26,416
We need to solve the problem first.
Goldman, recalibrate the system.

207
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,375
- It's Friday, let's go home.
- Not yet.

208
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:33,833
[answering machine] Hi, you
called my dad.  Leave a message.

209
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:38,458
Killian, this is Eve.  I know
you will probably still be

210
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,666
in Medulla but I'm a little
worried.  I don't know, wait.

211
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,166
Okay, there they are.  It's just that...

212
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,791
Do you know what?
It doesn't matter, I

213
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,666
have to go home
and leave work alone.

214
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:01,166
I'm free all weekend.
See you on Monday.  Hello.

215
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,833
[man] Stop worrying.
She activates that damned Medulla.

216
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,875
- Carter went home.
- Yup.

217
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,000
Is everything okay now?

218
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,875
It appears to have been a software problem.
It's all right.

219
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,750
- The sensors?  The redundancy systems?
- All in order.

220
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:31,041
Optimal.  So, I want to proceed
with the test and activate the Helios.

221
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,750
- As he said?
- You heard what I said.

222
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,250
Any problems?

223
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:43,666
But we wanted to do a series
of tests before activating it.

224
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,625
I'm not sure if the software
was the only problem.

225
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:49,875
And delay again?  Can you
explain it to the investors later?

226
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,000
- Declan!
- I want the system to be activated.

227
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,666
It's clear?  I've been clear?

228
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:59,625
Or do I have to fire you all
and go looking for a new team?

229
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,583
Proceed with activation.

230
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:13,791
[woman] Received.

231
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,541
[Killian] We take the commands of the Medulla.

232
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,125
Let's prepare the test.

233
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:24,291
Let's get to work and don't
think about what could go wrong.

234
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,708
[woman] We shouldn't
do this, he's not ready.

235
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:30,166
[Killian] Increase the flow to
maximum and release the Helios.

236
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:50,625
You come.

237
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,500
You will see, you will like it.

238
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,000
And... surprise!

239
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:07,375
Eve and Killian like to ride
horses up in the mountains.

240
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:14,458
Why don't you feed him?
So you will quickly become great friends.

241
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,625
- Here, like this.
- So cute!

242
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,083
Good good.  Keep it up.

243
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:36,500
- Your mother just started it.
-I didn't know you painted.

244
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,125
She looks like him.  A bit'.

245
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,541
I've done it at least 50 times.

246
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,625
You look good.

247
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,333
Me or the horse?

248
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:04,625
Both of them.

249
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:10,000
I was showing Nikki
around the house.

250
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:14,500
- Good.  Do you like your room?
- Not exactly.

251
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,625
You can furnish it as you wish.

252
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,000
I thank you.

253
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,125
- Have you eaten?  Sh
e-she was waiting for you.

254
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:34,083
Dad and I had dinner together on Fridays.

255
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,250
- Today is Friday, right?
- Yup.

256
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,250
- Loud.
- Here we go.

257
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:44,375
Let's eat and rest.
Tomorrow we will go to town.

258
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,541
- Good.
- I do.

259
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,750
- As you want.
- Go talk to Nikki.  I do.

260
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:58,833
No, no, that's fine.

261
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,833
-Where is she?
-In her room.

262
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,458
Has she been there the whole time?

263
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,458
She hasn't touched any food since you returned.

264
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,333
-She is punishing me, I know.
-She is scared.

265
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,000
- From what?
- [Olivia] From you.

266
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:16,875
- From me?  She doesn't make any sense.
- No?

267
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:21,291
A woman he does not know enters
his life and pretends to be a mother.

268
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,541
What does this mean?

269
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:28,458
Me, you and Henrich have
chosen to be activists also to make

270
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,333
a difference but some of us
have chosen not to have children.

271
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,875
Olivia, please!

272
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,875
It wasn't my choice.

273
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:40,541
Yes, but you decided it was
her father who raised her.

274
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:45,708
Now, you have to earn her trust
before she is truly her mother.

275
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,333
Thanks for the encouragement, indeed!

276
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,041
Do not mention it!

277
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,541
[Nikki] Hi, friends, check
out this compromising

278
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,500
video about PK and
Eve's latest discovery.

279
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,875
It is shown in detail...

280
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:11,291
- Man, Eve!  Can't you knock?
- I wanted to see what you were doing.

281
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,166
- I write on the blog.
- For real?  About what?

282
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:20,000
How bored I am here.  What do you want?

283
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,916
I just wanted...

284
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,083
Thing?

285
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:31,041
I wanted to tell you that I
am very sorry for your father.

286
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:33,500
It was a year ago.

287
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:36,666
I know but we've
seen so little since then.

288
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,291
I received your flowers.

289
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:41,750
I would have come to the
funeral, but my work stopped me.

290
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,583
That's what you wanted.

291
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:51,625
You know, I don't know what
your father told you, but...

292
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:57,000
- It really mattered to me.
- You have a strange way of showing it.

293
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:04,708
In any case, have you decided
to become a vegetarian?

294
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:08,583
Not me.  So, could I
have some meat for lunch?

295
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:14,416
- I did it because you're diabetic.
- Meat, Ive.  I need protein.

296
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,666
Ok.

297
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,083
[Henrich] Ive, there
are people for you.

298
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:19,333
I arrive.

299
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:22,958
It will take me a minute.

300
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,750
Don't make them wait.

301
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:37,750
Am I not entitled
to rest one day too?

302
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,875
The fact that my phone was
turned off could be a clue.

303
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:44,666
- Sorry, but we need your help.
- In what?

304
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,250
We activated it.

305
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,250
The Helios.

306
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,833
What the hell are you talking about?

307
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,250
Killian?

308
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:05,250
Perhaps, you have no
idea what risk you are taking.

309
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,166
Will you help us or not?

310
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:13,250
Help you?  I don't think it helped
when you made that stupid decision!

311
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:16,916
There are small changes in
pressure that alter the systems.

312
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,875
You have to check them.

313
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,250
He will never forgive me.

314
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,500
Who?

315
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:39,416
[pc] This new energy company
created by the Czech Republic.

316
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:44,125
This, ladies and gentlemen,
is a very great CIA conspiracy.

317
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:45,250
Nikki.

318
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:48,750
- Come on, go.
- It's about something...

319
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:50,125
Get out!

320
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,458
[Nikki] She doesn't want to
see me, I don't want to see her.

321
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:40,958
So, enough, I'm leaving.

322
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:51,416
[alarm]

323
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:03,708
I'm sorry you're locked up here.

324
00:26:05,791 --> 00:26:07,250
I have come to greet you.

325
00:26:18,916 --> 00:26:20,208
You don't look like you.

326
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,208
[man] The situation is getting worse.

327
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:33,833
The pressure on the relief
valve has increased by 49%.

328
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:36,625
- [Killian] I need to check this data.
- [Eve] Ok, I'm here with you.

329
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:39,125
- [man 1] What's going on?
- [man 2] Nothing good.

330
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,083
- It's 52%.
- It's all OK?

331
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:46,458
It is climbing faster than it should.

332
00:26:48,958 --> 00:26:50,750
Fuel pumps are okay, but

333
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:53,708
pump more Helios than normal.

334
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:57,041
[alarm]

335
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:01,750
- Sensor went to number nine.
- Try to disable it.

336
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:06,250
The back pressure will
damage the whole system.

337
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:10,250
- That was a bad idea, Declan.
- I did what needed to be done.

338
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:13,750
- Do you know what happens if everything skips?
- Just a few bangs.  It's working.

339
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:16,375
- So, we can follow the procedure.
- Damn, Declan.

340
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:18,458
You don't know what you're saying at all.
Stop everything.

341
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:19,541
I proceed.

342
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:22,375
[explosion]

343
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:30,333
- Very low pressure in the system.
- It's the valve that re-establishes itself.

344
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:32,916
Do you know for sure, Declan?  Check it out.

345
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:35,541
[alarm and explosion]

346
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:39,833
- The system is broken.
- There is no answer from Medulla.

347
00:27:39,916 --> 00:27:43,291
- The whole system is out of order.
- I load the backup systems.

348
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:46,083
- The rotors are gone.
- It wasn't supposed to happen.

349
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:47,708
Everyone shut up!

350
00:27:58,083 --> 00:27:59,625
Everybody get out of here!

351
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:03,750
[Killian] Quick, quick!  Out!

352
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,750
[Killian] Run away, quick!

353
00:28:31,916 --> 00:28:33,416
[shout]

354
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,333
My God!

355
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:49,916
Copper, Goldman,
Plint, Slater, get ready!

356
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,208
We have to reach Medulla.
We have to manually disable it.

357
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:59,500
[Copper] We can't go
there, it's too dangerous.

358
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:02,041
Are you deaf?  Move!  Here we go!

359
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:16,541
If I were you, I would start thinking
about how to limit the damage.

360
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,416
I think we have a problem.

361
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:42,541
Do not worry.

362
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:45,250
It is not at all prudent.

363
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:48,416
It'll be fine until it catches fire.

364
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:52,625
Then, nothing can help us.

365
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,500
Concentrate, we have less
than a minute to deactivate it.

366
00:29:57,625 --> 00:29:59,958
[Killian] Check for any leaks.

367
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,250
I have a really bad feeling.

368
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:09,333
A Helios reflux
is filling the room.

369
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:14,375
- Twenty seconds, guys.
- This is bad.

370
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:17,833
- Fifteen seconds.  Slater, fast.
- Here is a leak.

371
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,500
No, don't touch it!

372
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,416
[shout]

373
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,291
Get out of here, get out of here!

374
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,583
Killian!  Killian, what's going on?

375
00:30:58,166 --> 00:31:02,291
- There is a leak of Helios in Medulla.
- How much Helios pumped?

376
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:06,916
- A lot and still continues.
-He will go to all the tunnels under the city.

377
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:12,375
Congratulations!  You
just destroyed all our work!

378
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:13,458
And now?

379
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:18,500
If the fire reaches the mines, the
whole country will be destroyed.

380
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:23,041
The whole area will be
uninhabitable for at least 60 years.

381
00:31:23,166 --> 00:31:25,000
[explosion]

382
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:27,791
Another explosion!

383
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:31,041
No, worse.

384
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:37,083
Where are you going now?  You can't leave.
You can't do this, stay here.

385
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:41,375
- We have to fix it now!
- It's your fault!

386
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:53,791
[alarm]

387
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:57,291
Red alert.  Everyone run for cover!

388
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,291
[Declan] Come on, go!

389
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:16,625
- Open the doors.
- Why don't they open them?

390
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:19,250
Relax, it will be fine.
The Medulla does not respond.

391
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:21,291
[Killian] We can't
contain the fire.

392
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:24,625
[Killian] Again, we can't contain it.
We have to get out of here.

393
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:27,958
- [Killian] Open the elevator doors!
- Carter is gone.

394
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:32,291
How do you mean?  He'll call her back now.

395
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:36,541
It does not matter.
I evacuated all personnel.

396
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:41,916
Listen, Declan.  Open the elevator
doors and we will find a solution.

397
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,666
No I will not do it.

398
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,333
Declan, what the hell are you saying?
Open the elevator!

399
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:48,625
I'm so sorry.

400
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:52,500
Declan, there are people down here.
Let us in.

401
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:56,958
[Killian] Declan!  We will die down here!

402
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:01,916
[Slater] Why doesn't he want to help us?

403
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:04,833
[Copper] To save his ass.

404
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:10,875
Okay, guys.  We have to take off
these suits.  They are full of Helios.

405
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:13,958
[Killian] If we're quick,
we'll get to the north shaft.

406
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,958
OK let's go.

407
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:23,000
[Killian] I hope Carter finds a way to
stop the Helios before he gets to Prague.

408
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:26,833
- [Goldman] What if he can't?
- [Copper] Game over.

409
00:33:28,208 --> 00:33:33,583
[Eve] Killian, call me!  The Helios is
causing explosions.  How do we stop it?

410
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:47,208
[man] Declan, did you notice
they're evacuating the city?

411
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,916
There's a bit of confusion.

412
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,416
[man] Confusion?  This
time we got it really big.

413
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,208
Yes, there were some risks.

414
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:01,333
And now I'm seeing it for myself.

415
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:19,208
Nikki!

416
00:34:24,916 --> 00:34:27,791
Thank goodness you are fine!
Nikki, are you okay?

417
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:32,416
We're fine, we're fine.  It looked
like a classic California 6.5 shock.

418
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,916
- [Henrich] You don't look good.
- [Olivia] What happened?

419
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,958
There's been an accident at the plant.  It's
almost sure, there will be another shock.

420
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:40,291
- We have to leave.
- [Henrich] Because of that idiot?

421
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:42,833
- There's no use arguing.
- Hell, Eve.  I told you.

422
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:44,791
They will use your
technology for evil purposes.

423
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:48,083
- Stop it, Henrich.
- Did your company cause all this?

424
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:50,666
- Isn't it time to talk about this?
- And when, then?

425
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,541
We get water, torches, matches.

426
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,041
Nikki, I want you to fill this bag.

427
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:00,458
Take her to the car.

428
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,458
Come on, let's hurry up, come on!

429
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,041
- Come on, Nikki.
- [Olivia] Nikki, go!

430
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:08,916
Go!

431
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:13,666
Come on, let's go!  Come on, let's go!  Quick!

432
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:25,708
[Henrich] We can't let it all
burn.  We must do something.

433
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,916
[Eve] Nikki, jump up!

434
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:32,791
[nitrites]

435
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:35,500
Horses!  I have to free the horses!

436
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:38,208
Nikki!

437
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:50,416
Do not close the door.  I free them immediately!

438
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,250
- Ok, ok.
- Okay.

439
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,583
I'm taking her out.  We hope he follows her.

440
00:35:57,958 --> 00:36:00,083
- Force!
- Come on, beautiful!  On!

441
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:03,166
Come on then!  Run Run!

442
00:36:04,458 --> 00:36:05,458
Run!

443
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,541
Good!  Let's go let's go!

444
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:12,750
Come on, let's go!

445
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:19,416
[Declan] Can you hear me?  Carter?

446
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,583
- They're calling you.
- Come on, let's go!

447
00:36:21,666 --> 00:36:23,208
- [Olivia] They're looking for you.
- Who?

448
00:36:23,291 --> 00:36:25,875
- [Declan] Can you hear me?
- Get in the car.

449
00:36:25,958 --> 00:36:31,000
- So, did you join Nikki?
-She's fine.  In the car!  What do you want?

450
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:32,666
What are you going to do now?

451
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,666
I'm taking Nikki to safety and
then trying to fix your mess.

452
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:39,083
It is late, the fire has destroyed
everything, Medulla and the rest.

453
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:42,041
- Killian?
- Died.

454
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:50,083
Son of a bitch!  Why didn't you
listen to me?  I told you it wasn't ready!

455
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,833
- So, what are you going to do now?
- I don't know what I'm going to do either.

456
00:36:53,916 --> 00:36:58,083
- Or rather, what will you say?
- I'll tell everyone the truth.

457
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:02,375
That you forced Killian to activate
the Helios when he wasn't ready yet!

458
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:06,708
Your word against mine.
In everything, you will be complicit.

459
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:10,958
Accomplice?  Is this how he is going to
end?  You know what?  And who cares!

460
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:12,541
It's your choice.

461
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:18,708
Let's move!

462
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:21,916
- Eve, you go.
- How?

463
00:37:21,958 --> 00:37:24,583
- We stay.
- No, what do you say?

464
00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:27,833
- Rightly so.
- It's not safe here.

465
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:32,541
This is the only place Olivia
and I consider our home.

466
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,916
It is not easy to leave it and
go around the world again.

467
00:37:35,958 --> 00:37:40,125
But let's go!  We have done it so
many times.  We can do it again!

468
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:44,250
No, by staying here we can still
prevent the flames from knocking it down.

469
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:47,458
- We'll be fine, Eve.  Don't worry.
- No, please.

470
00:37:47,541 --> 00:37:52,041
- Eve, let's go!
- Go!  You have Nikki and we have the house.

471
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,666
- Are you sure?
- Yes, of course!

472
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,375
- Listen to them!
- [Olivia] Go!

473
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,791
[explosion and coughing]

474
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,166
Christ!

475
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:16,541
Thank God there
is still some current.

476
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:19,750
It's madness to take us there.
We are not miners.

477
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:23,041
- Don't freak out, okay?
- It doesn't seem that strange to me.

478
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:25,750
I care about my life.
Did you see what happened to Plint?

479
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:29,375
I don't want to die.
There will be a way out, right?

480
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:30,833
There is, for sure.

481
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:34,750
- And now?  Game over?
- Okay, now stop it.

482
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:37,875
We have 12 hours
before the oxygen runs out.

483
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:41,166
We need to find the
emergency exit and get to safety.

484
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,291
[Copper] she's too far away.

485
00:38:44,541 --> 00:38:48,833
Look, I don't promise you
anything, but I guarantee

486
00:38:48,916 --> 00:38:51,125
that I'll do what I can to
get out of here whole.  Ok?

487
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:56,458
- Copper.
- Yes, OK.

488
00:38:57,041 --> 00:39:00,291
Let's stick together and go this way.
Courage!

489
00:39:04,416 --> 00:39:07,916
[Nikki] I'm sorry, but you can't
stop them from saving their home.

490
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,666
- They're important to me.
- I know it!

491
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:23,083
- How do you find horses?
- Thing?

492
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,125
Do you know Olivia and Henrich's horses?
Frao and Fraulina.

493
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:32,291
- I never understood those names.
- Are you serious?

494
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:34,625
I taught your father to ride.

495
00:39:39,666 --> 00:39:42,583
- Everything is fine?
- They'll blame you for all this.

496
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:45,166
For sure, my boss Declan will.

497
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:47,458
Perhaps, he is right.

498
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:51,458
Do you really believe that?

499
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:55,416
I've seen you maybe
twice in the past two years.

500
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:00,583
- I know absolutely nothing about you.
- Check on the tablet if there are any news.

501
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:07,625
- [Copper] Do you think that's true?
- [Killian] What?

502
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:11,041
[Copper] That the CIA funded
Medulla knowing it would explode.

503
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:14,583
They try to bring troops to
Ukraine for oil-related issues.

504
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:17,750
- [Slater] It's ridiculous.
- [Copper] No, not at all.

505
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:23,666
- We got lost.
- Stop whining, Copper!  Force!

506
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:36,458
A large leak occurred
from the Helios chemical

507
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:38,833
plant causing multiple
underground fires.

508
00:40:38,916 --> 00:40:42,250
Could this be the cause of
the ongoing earthquakes?

509
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:47,041
At these extreme temperatures
the Helios manages to burn

510
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:51,458
by literally digging uncontrollable
underground channels

511
00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:56,500
just like the fault lines that
in contact cause earthquakes.

512
00:40:56,583 --> 00:41:00,708
This NASA image shows us
how Helios burns underground.

513
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:05,458
As you can see, it is heading
towards Prague at a great speed.

514
00:41:05,541 --> 00:41:08,208
The Helios fire must
be stopped or else

515
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:11,041
the city will be
destroyed in 12 hours.

516
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:13,250
and with it thousands of human lives.

517
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:16,541
- How long will it burn?
- It's hard to say.

518
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:21,916
We are trying to
contact Dr. Carter

519
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,250
who created this
substance but we cannot.

520
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:26,750
We have Declan Glas with us
who will tell us what happened.

521
00:41:26,833 --> 00:41:29,166
My company
believed in Dr. Carter.

522
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,958
You have not only
betrayed our trust

523
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:34,250
but also that which
Europe placed in you.

524
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:36,958
This is a blow to
me as I considered

525
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:40,208
Dr. Carter a dear and
sincere friend of her.

526
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,708
Nikki, what are you doing?

527
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:48,458
- Nikki!  Nikki, don't do this!
- Let me out!

528
00:41:49,291 --> 00:41:50,291
Ok.

529
00:41:51,791 --> 00:41:56,541
Niki, stop!  What are you doing?
Get back in the car right away!

530
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:59,333
- I'm done with you.
- Where are you going?

531
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:02,541
- At home!
- Stop!  Is this your home!

532
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:06,583
Here?  Right in the middle
of your stupid experiment?

533
00:42:06,666 --> 00:42:10,333
It was not my fault.
My science is safe.

534
00:42:10,416 --> 00:42:12,916
Did you abandon me and dad for this?

535
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,083
When she said, "Your mother
is trying to save the world."

536
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:21,250
She kept repeating it to me before
she died.  She has always admired you.

537
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:25,458
Probably, she still loved you.
This is crap.

538
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:28,458
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- You didn't do anything!

539
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:31,500
- I'm trying.
- I hope they blame you!

540
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,875
So you get what you deserve!

541
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:39,833
[explosion]

542
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:42,458
Let's get back in the car, let's go!

543
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:48,833
- Force!
- You hurt me!

544
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:51,833
Sit here next to me!  Enter!

545
00:42:56,791 --> 00:43:00,500
Put on the belt.  Put it on!

546
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:06,958
- My God!
- What was it?

547
00:43:08,708 --> 00:43:10,041
My God!

548
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:18,125
Get out of here!  Rapid!

549
00:43:21,416 --> 00:43:22,708
My God!

550
00:43:23,708 --> 00:43:27,000
- Open the door.  Open the door!
- I can not make it.

551
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:29,750
- Come on, get out!
- I can't open it!

552
00:43:31,708 --> 00:43:34,208
- Go out!
- My God!

553
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:36,083
Damn!

554
00:43:40,416 --> 00:43:42,833
[coughing]

555
00:44:06,166 --> 00:44:11,333
- Henrich, Olivia!  What are you doing here?
- We could ask you the same question.

556
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:14,291
I do not believe.  I'm looking for Carter.

557
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:17,541
-He's gone.
- I want to help you.

558
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:18,625
Do not tell me?

559
00:44:18,708 --> 00:44:22,708
I'm sure with all the problems
you have, you better leave.

560
00:44:22,791 --> 00:44:24,958
But what is all this hostility?

561
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:28,166
-I just want to make up for the mess of him.
- Was it her?

562
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:32,000
- Yes why?  What did she tell you?
- What about?

563
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:33,166
Of the accident.

564
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:37,333
She said that if anything
someone had come here and

565
00:44:37,416 --> 00:44:39,416
said it was her fault for
not believing a single word.

566
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,833
I had guessed.

567
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:13,458
I was starting to worry about her.

568
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:16,916
- Calm.
- Where I am?

569
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,625
You stay calm, in a reception camp.
Welcome...

570
00:45:19,708 --> 00:45:20,791
You are not a doctor!

571
00:45:20,875 --> 00:45:23,958
I am not a doctor.  Luckily,
I found her car in time.

572
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:26,458
- Where is my daughter?
- Let me guess.  Nikki?

573
00:45:26,541 --> 00:45:28,041
-Yes.
-She's fine.

574
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:30,208
Her head was spinning a little, but she's fine.

575
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:34,833
-Where is she?  Take me to her.
-If she calms down, that's what I'll do.

576
00:45:34,916 --> 00:45:37,125
My God, I'm the worst
mother in the world!

577
00:45:39,166 --> 00:45:40,791
Calm down, okay?

578
00:45:41,541 --> 00:45:44,750
I hope that one day she will be able to forgive me.

579
00:45:48,291 --> 00:45:51,458
- My God!
-Why don't you help us by giving us a hand?

580
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:53,583
Sure, but I don't know what to do.

581
00:45:53,666 --> 00:45:56,291
We haven't been
trained for this either.

582
00:45:56,375 --> 00:45:59,416
- Luckily you're here.
- We lost two trucks

583
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,708
with medical supplies
and we are understaffed.

584
00:46:07,458 --> 00:46:10,916
- Okay.  So what do I do?
- Look around.

585
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,041
These people are terrified.
Try to reassure them.

586
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:16,583
Captain, come quickly!

587
00:46:17,666 --> 00:46:18,666
Excuse me.

588
00:46:25,166 --> 00:46:27,916
Nikki!  Nikki, are you okay?

589
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Treasure!

590
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:32,625
Thank God you are fine!

591
00:46:33,625 --> 00:46:37,416
- Everything is OK?
- Yes. There are so many people.

592
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,541
Already.

593
00:46:40,666 --> 00:46:41,708
Is full.

594
00:46:42,958 --> 00:46:44,458
[Eve] And who are they?

595
00:46:46,208 --> 00:46:48,708
[Nikki] I think
they lost their son.

596
00:46:54,708 --> 00:46:57,041
I would like to do something to help them.

597
00:46:57,833 --> 00:47:02,500
- Maybe, I could go talk to him.
- And say what?  What do you mind?

598
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:06,500
Nikki, what should I do?
I'm really sorry.

599
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:11,083
You know what?  You have to help
me with the next patient.  Here we go!

600
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:33,375
So, we need an alternate transport
since you destroyed the last one.

601
00:47:36,583 --> 00:47:37,583
Ok.

602
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,750
Repair engines now?

603
00:47:39,833 --> 00:47:44,416
Dad liked the idea that you
were an all-round engineer.

604
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,833
He tried it with me too.

605
00:47:47,583 --> 00:47:50,041
- Did he succeed?
- In fact, no.

606
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:52,416
I'm more of a theoretical engineer.

607
00:47:53,416 --> 00:47:56,291
You know, he was
super smart too, Eve.

608
00:47:56,375 --> 00:48:01,291
I know it.  He was very smart.
This is also why I married him.

609
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:04,416
What do you need?

610
00:48:05,708 --> 00:48:07,291
Give me the wrench.

611
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:16,500
What's wrong?  Where is the insulin?

612
00:48:16,583 --> 00:48:19,416
I'm fine.  I just have to eat something or...

613
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,458
- Where's your kit?
- I do not know.

614
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:26,375
- This is serious.
- You shouldn't have had the accident.

615
00:48:26,458 --> 00:48:30,166
I don't... listen, sit down and stay here.
I will be right back.

616
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:43,750
[Slater] We should be close by now.

617
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,833
- [Goldman] It's super tight below.
- [Killian] Okay, let's keep calm.

618
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:55,708
[Killian] Here we pass better.

619
00:48:55,791 --> 00:48:58,041
[Goldman] I hope
Diane and her are okay.

620
00:49:00,166 --> 00:49:01,541
[Slater] I'm sure so.

621
00:49:03,291 --> 00:49:07,625
- [Copper] What's going on out there?
- [Slater] I don't know, okay?  Come on, walk!

622
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:09,333
[Killian] This way, come on!

623
00:49:10,958 --> 00:49:13,041
[Killian] Yes, it looks like the right way!

624
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,166
[man] Close ranks!

625
00:49:22,708 --> 00:49:24,166
Killian, it's me.

626
00:49:26,916 --> 00:49:32,708
I used to come to you looking for answers,
but you... it doesn't matter.  Cabbage!

627
00:49:58,083 --> 00:49:59,125
The dam!

628
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:06,333
We have five hours before
the Helios reaches Prague.

629
00:50:08,458 --> 00:50:12,541
- Sorry, sorry, I have to see...
- Dr. Carter, what do you think you're doing?

630
00:50:12,625 --> 00:50:14,041
I need to see a map.

631
00:50:15,916 --> 00:50:18,458
Okay, so here we are.  The dam is here.

632
00:50:20,041 --> 00:50:24,416
And if we open the gate like this,
the whole valley will be flooded.

633
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,916
- Female doctor!
- I need to speak to the field officer.

634
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,666
- It's about Nikki.
- Thing?

635
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:32,583
- Come with me.
- But.... is she okay?  What happened?

636
00:50:33,791 --> 00:50:35,041
[Eve] Nikki!

637
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:39,083
Nikki, Nikki!  I am here.

638
00:50:39,791 --> 00:50:41,875
- Pope?
-You are diabetic, right?

639
00:50:41,958 --> 00:50:44,583
Yes, I can't find the insulin kit.

640
00:50:46,916 --> 00:50:50,333
I gave her some fruit juice, but
it's not enough to get her back.

641
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:54,916
Captain, when you found us in
the car, did you see an insulin kit?

642
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,958
- No, no insulin.
- There is not here.

643
00:51:00,083 --> 00:51:02,291
- See what I can do.
- We need some juice.

644
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:06,625
Look, I'm Captain Hill.  Bring
something sweet to the medical tent.  Now!

645
00:51:06,708 --> 00:51:09,250
Look at me, stay with me.  Stay with me!

646
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:14,166
Do you know what?
Juice is not enough.  You need insulin.

647
00:51:14,875 --> 00:51:19,000
Look, with all these evacuees,
we're running out of supplies.

648
00:51:19,083 --> 00:51:22,083
- Here you are, sir.
- That's all?  Is that all that's left?

649
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:24,291
- Yes, that's all.
- Thank you.

650
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,500
- Come on.
- [Hill] Negative, corporal.

651
00:51:29,583 --> 00:51:33,708
[Hill] We need to focus on the injured.  Let
the local forces think about the looting!

652
00:51:37,166 --> 00:51:40,708
- You don't have insulin?
- Look, there's a town nearby.

653
00:51:40,791 --> 00:51:43,791
- Okay?  We will check if there is a pharmacy.
- Can anyone go there?

654
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:46,250
It is not possible.
Another team will arrive in the morning.

655
00:51:46,333 --> 00:51:49,833
In the morning?
It will be too late in the morning.

656
00:51:49,916 --> 00:51:53,041
- You need insulin now.
- Female doctor...

657
00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:55,958
- I'll go.
- How will he get there?

658
00:51:57,208 --> 00:51:59,000
He will use the motorcycle.

659
00:52:03,833 --> 00:52:05,583
- You'll make it?
- Yup.

660
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:09,916
- You know, I have a son Nikki's age.
- For real?  What's your name?

661
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,166
Tom.

662
00:52:12,375 --> 00:52:16,000
Look, I have to be honest with you.
I don't think that's a good idea.

663
00:52:17,083 --> 00:52:20,291
I have another plan.
Try to stop the fires.

664
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:23,666
Flood the valley with water from the dam.

665
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:27,041
Of course!  And the government?
Do you think he'll let him?

666
00:52:27,125 --> 00:52:30,708
Look, the Helios will burn
for 100 years if we don't stop it.

667
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:34,583
Look, this goes...
this is way beyond my rank.

668
00:52:34,666 --> 00:52:38,958
Look, if he wants advice, now
he has to think about her daughter.

669
00:52:39,666 --> 00:52:40,666
I know it.

670
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:54,125
Her face is all over the news.
Remember the plant accident?

671
00:52:54,208 --> 00:52:55,666
What they say?

672
00:52:59,916 --> 00:53:00,916
Look...

673
00:53:02,208 --> 00:53:04,291
You take this and be careful.

674
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,416
- I hate guns.
- Listen to me.

675
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,333
There are many people
who believe it was her.  Ok?

676
00:53:13,416 --> 00:53:18,833
I risk court martial for this.
I want you to be back within the hour.

677
00:53:19,916 --> 00:53:24,291
- I promise.  Thanks, captain.
- My name is Derek.

678
00:53:25,916 --> 00:53:28,333
Good luck.  He will serve you.

679
00:53:45,083 --> 00:53:47,375
- Need help?
- Captain, yes.

680
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:50,583
I am looking for a woman and her daughter.
I think they were here.

681
00:53:50,666 --> 00:53:53,708
- The Americans?
- Yes, yes.  Can he tell me where I am?

682
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:57,041
They left the base.

683
00:53:57,125 --> 00:53:59,583
[Goldman] Someone will be looking for us.

684
00:53:59,666 --> 00:54:02,083
[Copper] Declan must
have said we're dead.

685
00:54:02,208 --> 00:54:04,250
[radio frequency signals]

686
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:07,791
- Didn't you find anyone?
- None, there is no signal.

687
00:54:08,833 --> 00:54:12,000
[Copper] Declan is crazy.
He interrogated prisoners in Vietnam.

688
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:16,083
- Wait.
- What... what's going on?

689
00:54:17,041 --> 00:54:20,125
This...
this crossroads shouldn't be there.

690
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:25,166
- [Copper] We walked for hours.
- [Goldman] You mean we got lost?

691
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:26,791
Let me think.

692
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:38,666
[explosions]

693
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,375
We have to go, go!

694
00:54:42,041 --> 00:54:43,166
Go! Go! Go!

695
00:54:45,083 --> 00:54:47,083
Come on, come on, come on!  Street!

696
00:54:51,416 --> 00:54:54,541
[Copper] My God!  We are trapped!

697
00:55:04,208 --> 00:55:06,458
Come on, let's go!

698
00:55:26,083 --> 00:55:27,666
- [woman] Over here!
- [man] Over here!

699
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:32,666
- I need insulin, Eve.
- I know it.  I'm looking for it, ok?

700
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:36,708
- Stay close to me.
- Because?

701
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:38,791
Why yes, okay?

702
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,833
Come on, come on, come on!

703
00:55:56,541 --> 00:56:01,500
[sirens]

704
00:56:06,291 --> 00:56:11,416
- Mom, I'm not feeling well at all.
- Don't worry, now we find some insulin.

705
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,458
- How did you lose the kit I had?
- It's not my fault.

706
00:56:15,666 --> 00:56:17,208
It is never your fault.

707
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:21,291
It is your medicine.
Haven't you learned to look after yourself?

708
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:25,333
- Thing?
- Excuse me.  Sorry, let's go.

709
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:28,416
Now, we find a pharmacy.
Come on, let's go!

710
00:56:30,041 --> 00:56:33,291
- Rapid!
- Do you think we'll be safe there?

711
00:56:33,416 --> 00:56:34,416
Force!

712
00:56:47,458 --> 00:56:50,875
- [man 1] It's about to explode!
- [man 2] Easy, easy!

713
00:56:50,958 --> 00:56:52,000
[man 3] Away, away!

714
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:57,916
- Let's go in here.
- It's not a pharmacy.

715
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
- I know, I know, but that's all.  Force!
- I need a pharmacy!

716
00:57:02,083 --> 00:57:05,125
[man 4] What are you doing here?
Go away, go away!

717
00:57:05,208 --> 00:57:06,416
Move!

718
00:57:11,458 --> 00:57:12,625
I do not feel well.

719
00:57:20,708 --> 00:57:21,875
Over there.

720
00:57:23,125 --> 00:57:26,583
- You take!  I have not found better.
- Thank you.

721
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:33,041
- [man 5] Guys, look there!
- [man 6] Hey, grandpa!

722
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:41,250
[gunshot]

723
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:42,333
[man 5] Go!

724
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:45,875
What was it?

725
00:57:45,958 --> 00:57:47,041
[Declan] Carter!

726
00:57:51,083 --> 00:57:52,291
Carter!

727
00:57:54,375 --> 00:57:57,750
Listen to me.  I have to talk to you.

728
00:57:57,833 --> 00:57:58,833
Who is?

729
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:02,250
[Declan] I want to help you, Carter.

730
00:58:02,833 --> 00:58:04,083
What happens?

731
00:58:13,458 --> 00:58:18,083
Okay, we have to leave.
Collect everything and follow me.

732
00:58:40,458 --> 00:58:43,208
- Follow me.  Are you ready?
- Yup.

733
00:58:43,291 --> 00:58:44,375
Here we go!

734
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:06,583
Down, down!

735
00:59:26,416 --> 00:59:28,583
[coughing]

736
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:30,916
Come on come on!
There is no more time, no oxygen.

737
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:34,333
It's getting hot down here.
The fire is approaching.

738
00:59:34,416 --> 00:59:36,666
- We ended up in the pan.
- Yup.

739
00:59:37,375 --> 00:59:40,083
- Not in the pan, but on the stove.
- What are you talking about?

740
00:59:40,166 --> 00:59:43,500
- Relax, everything will be fine.
- No, no, no.  What are you talking about?

741
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:47,291
I just think when we get out of here,
there will be other issues to be resolved.

742
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:50,416
- Declan wanted to kill us.
- Money pushes us to do bad things.

743
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,333
Yes, but what's stopping
him from finishing the job?

744
00:59:53,416 --> 00:59:55,333
The truth, only the truth.

745
00:59:56,833 --> 01:00:00,250
- We might not say anything to anyone.
- Hey, listen to everyone!

746
01:00:00,333 --> 01:00:04,000
When we get out of here, we'll tell
everyone the truth and what Declan did.  Ok?

747
01:00:04,083 --> 01:00:06,791
- Thing?
- Do you think lying will help you?

748
01:00:08,083 --> 01:00:12,458
The best way to keep a secret is to
get rid of those who know it.  All right?

749
01:00:14,125 --> 01:00:16,166
Ok, ok.

750
01:00:17,708 --> 01:00:20,083
- Received.
- I'm with you.

751
01:00:20,166 --> 01:00:25,250
Good.  Let's carry on and we'll get
out of here in a moment.  Here we go!

752
01:01:00,375 --> 01:01:02,125
Quick, hurry up!

753
01:01:05,041 --> 01:01:06,041
Here we go!

754
01:01:11,375 --> 01:01:12,541
- Turn on.
- Where?

755
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:14,208
- Turn on!
- Where?

756
01:01:16,041 --> 01:01:17,083
Come on, get up!

757
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:26,833
- You can't drive!
- You're not capable either.  So, get in!

758
01:02:20,666 --> 01:02:22,958
[Slater] They look like the
access stairs to the mine.

759
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:26,375
[Slater] We have to be close to
the surface.  Killian, try the radio.

760
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:28,041
[Slater] See if it works.

761
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:34,541
Carter!  Carter, can you hear me?

762
01:02:38,291 --> 01:02:42,041
[Killian] Carter, try.
One two Three.  Carter, come in!

763
01:02:43,375 --> 01:02:44,625
What you are doing?

764
01:02:46,541 --> 01:02:48,041
- Killian?
- Carter!

765
01:02:49,583 --> 01:02:51,791
- Do you receive me?
- Killian!

766
01:02:52,875 --> 01:02:56,291
- Thank God, you're alive!
- Yes, we're fine.

767
01:02:58,583 --> 01:03:02,041
We are at the old mine entrance.
We are looking for a way out.

768
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:04,125
Only at this point is there a signal.
Where are you?

769
01:03:06,375 --> 01:03:11,083
[Eve] I'm going to the dam.
I know how to stop this!

770
01:03:12,541 --> 01:03:14,833
- Fire?
- The seismic fire.

771
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:18,583
- Is that what they call it?
- We use the dam.

772
01:03:18,666 --> 01:03:21,791
We can empty it all
and put out the fires.

773
01:03:21,875 --> 01:03:24,916
[Eve] You have to get out of
there before I clear the water.

774
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,416
You will flood the valley
and wipe out the city.

775
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:32,083
No, listen.  The main
artery of the mine is

776
01:03:32,166 --> 01:03:34,791
east of the lock and
leads to the river.  Right?

777
01:03:34,875 --> 01:03:36,916
It is about 3,000
meters below the lock.

778
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,958
Exactly.  The temperature
there is very high due to the fires.

779
01:03:41,166 --> 01:03:43,125
- Already.
- Already.

780
01:03:43,208 --> 01:03:45,916
And a huge discharge of
water can get to the river bed

781
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,666
and in this way it will flood
the mines, put out the fires

782
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:50,125
and will neutralize the Helios.

783
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:54,916
It is very risky.  If it doesn't get to the
river, the water will flood the entire city.

784
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,708
- You have a better idea.
- No.

785
01:03:58,666 --> 01:04:02,833
- Okay, me neither.
- Listen to me well.  Stay away from Declan.

786
01:04:02,916 --> 01:04:05,583
[Killian] He blocked us
below and tried to kill us.

787
01:04:05,666 --> 01:04:07,375
Tell her to get us out.

788
01:04:07,458 --> 01:04:11,916
-He just tried to shoot me.
- Stay away from him.  You heard me?

789
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:17,250
Yes. And you be careful.  Ok?  Get
out of the mine as fast as possible.

790
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:18,333
Received.

791
01:04:19,125 --> 01:04:20,625
We hope well.

792
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:22,708
The dam!

793
01:04:24,708 --> 01:04:25,833
Okay, guys.

794
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:29,541
- At least, we've made contact.
- Already.

795
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,666
Well, let's continue.

796
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:40,083
- So, you want to open a dam?
- Yup.

797
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:43,583
Nikki, what is it?

798
01:04:44,625 --> 01:04:47,250
Next time tell me first, mom.

799
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,750
Mom.  I would say I like it.

800
01:04:51,958 --> 01:04:54,833
Yes, but don't get used to it, Eve.

801
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:56,958
Here we go.

802
01:05:01,958 --> 01:05:05,083
This is the access to the old mine.
Lead to the stairs.

803
01:05:05,166 --> 01:05:06,541
We can get out of there!

804
01:05:10,083 --> 01:05:11,083
Here we go!

805
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:14,000
Come on, move, everything will be fine!

806
01:05:17,458 --> 01:05:19,125
It feels like being in hell.

807
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:23,708
It will be day very soon.
We need to refuel.

808
01:05:24,583 --> 01:05:27,458
Going straight on that road,
we will arrive at the dam.

809
01:05:27,541 --> 01:05:28,625
If you say so...

810
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:31,750
Ok, stop.

811
01:05:39,166 --> 01:05:41,666
There is no current.  No petrol.

812
01:05:45,291 --> 01:05:46,458
Let's go in.

813
01:05:47,666 --> 01:05:48,791
Stop!

814
01:05:49,666 --> 01:05:51,875
- All right.
- What do you want?

815
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:53,125
Just some food.

816
01:05:54,791 --> 01:05:55,833
Gas.

817
01:05:57,041 --> 01:05:59,958
OK Go.  Go!  Eat something.

818
01:06:06,041 --> 01:06:08,000
Can you activate the distributor?

819
01:06:08,875 --> 01:06:10,291
I don't know how to do it.

820
01:06:11,833 --> 01:06:14,125
There is a counter.  I take a look.

821
01:06:15,041 --> 01:06:17,916
- Did your father teach you that?
- Already.

822
01:06:21,333 --> 01:06:24,958
Promethean Kinetics, a chemical
company implicated in the disaster,

823
01:06:25,041 --> 01:06:29,125
has just released a statement.
She grieves over the lives she has lost

824
01:06:29,208 --> 01:06:33,000
but she is not responsible for the
actions committed by Dr. Carter.

825
01:06:33,083 --> 01:06:36,625
Evidence was found of her
involvement in the disaster.

826
01:06:36,708 --> 01:06:39,625
- Do not move!
- No, wait!  That's not how it went.

827
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:43,208
- It was you!
- Look, don't do this.

828
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:45,583
[TV] We will give five million
euros to anyone who finds it.

829
01:06:45,666 --> 01:06:48,750
I have five million
good reasons to do it.

830
01:06:48,833 --> 01:06:52,458
- Mom, we have to leave now.
- Don't go anywhere.

831
01:06:54,625 --> 01:06:58,250
[radio] To all units.
We're looking for Dr. Carter.  Caution.

832
01:06:58,333 --> 01:07:02,166
She could be armed.  She
was last seen driving a sidecar.

833
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,083
- Throw it down!
- My God!

834
01:07:07,166 --> 01:07:10,875
- Mom, what do you want to do?  Come on let's go!
- Put it down!

835
01:07:10,958 --> 01:07:14,666
Come on, there's a five
million euro bounty on my head.

836
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:17,666
I am dangerous!  Put it down!

837
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,833
[shooting]

838
01:07:38,625 --> 01:07:39,875
- What happens?
- Don't shoot!

839
01:07:39,958 --> 01:07:41,375
We heard shots.

840
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:45,083
- What do you want to do?
- Steal the police car.

841
01:07:45,166 --> 01:07:46,916
Hurray, mother of the year!

842
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,541
Dr. Carter ran away from the back.

843
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:53,083
[screech of tires]

844
01:07:59,541 --> 01:08:03,333
- [Goldman] What is this noise?
- [Copper] But what do you care?

845
01:08:03,416 --> 01:08:06,250
[Copper] she You die of heat.
I find it hard to breathe.

846
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:15,958
[Goldman] And what the hell is that?

847
01:08:20,375 --> 01:08:21,708
Get back.

848
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:27,166
[Slater] My God!  It is more serious
than expected.  We have to go back.

849
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:28,875
[Killian] No, we can't.

850
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:37,625
[Killian] We don't have enough time.

851
01:08:40,875 --> 01:08:42,541
[Killian] We have to jump.

852
01:08:43,958 --> 01:08:45,000
It is the only way.

853
01:08:45,958 --> 01:08:47,333
Great!

854
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:49,750
[Killian] We can do it!

855
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:07,541
I'm not sure what's going on,
but I think you'll go straight to jail.

856
01:09:07,625 --> 01:09:11,250
- You believe?
- Yeah, sure.

857
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:24,875
She was here.
She fled when she heard you coming.

858
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:29,500
- Who?  Carter?
- Yes, it was her.  I recognized her on TV.

859
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:34,750
- Can I help you, sir?
- No, I'm just a curious citizen.

860
01:09:43,083 --> 01:09:44,125
Ok.

861
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:47,250
- We can jump.
- Thing?

862
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:49,375
- Thing?
- It's just over two meters.

863
01:09:50,875 --> 01:09:53,083
- [Killian] We can do it.
- Are you sure?

864
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:55,791
- Yes, OK.

865
01:09:56,791 --> 01:09:58,166
Ok.

866
01:09:58,666 --> 01:10:00,666
- Okay.
- Okay.

867
01:10:15,541 --> 01:10:20,000
Not bad for an old man, huh?
Ok, quick.  One by one.

868
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:23,958
- Okay.
- [Killian] Goldman, you go.  Come on!

869
01:10:24,041 --> 01:10:28,916
[radio] Unit 16, we are
heading to the north side of the

870
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,208
mountain to stop the fire and
look for the survivors.  Step.

871
01:10:34,416 --> 01:10:35,750
Who would have thought that!

872
01:10:36,541 --> 01:10:38,458
Dr. Eve Carter!

873
01:10:39,875 --> 01:10:43,250
Scientist, activist...

874
01:10:47,333 --> 01:10:49,500
Mom of the year!

875
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:56,708
[man] The TV is
all about, Declan.

876
01:10:56,791 --> 01:10:58,791
You need to resolve
this situation immediately!

877
01:10:58,875 --> 01:11:01,625
[Declan] I'm working
on it, don't worry.

878
01:11:01,708 --> 01:11:05,708
- Come on, you can do it!
- Do you know in what subject I was a sucker?

879
01:11:05,791 --> 01:11:07,000
- Gym!
- So?

880
01:11:07,083 --> 01:11:09,541
He is older and he made it.
So, take courage!

881
01:11:09,625 --> 01:11:12,166
[Copper] If he
made it, you can too.

882
01:11:13,291 --> 01:11:15,791
- Are you going first?
- Slater!

883
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:20,000
See you on the other side, okay?

884
01:11:25,916 --> 01:11:27,041
Good!

885
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:31,125
All right, are you there?

886
01:11:32,416 --> 01:11:33,875
- Come on, Goldman!
- Here we go!

887
01:11:33,958 --> 01:11:37,500
- Shall I hold your hand?
- What the fuck are you saying?  I can do it!

888
01:11:39,875 --> 01:11:41,375
- Come on!
- You'll do it!

889
01:11:41,458 --> 01:11:43,166
[explosion]

890
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:48,416
Let's go let's go!

891
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:53,250
No!

892
01:11:54,791 --> 01:11:57,833
Help!  Help me!  I'm slipping!

893
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:02,583
Help me!  Hate!  Help me, please!

894
01:12:03,208 --> 01:12:05,666
Don't leave me, please!

895
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,500
God, don't leave me!

896
01:12:29,208 --> 01:12:32,125
Come on, we have to get out of here.

897
01:12:39,125 --> 01:12:41,250
I'm sorry.  Ok?

898
01:12:42,041 --> 01:12:43,333
We are shocked.

899
01:12:44,875 --> 01:12:47,583
But we have to get out of here.  Agree?

900
01:12:49,458 --> 01:12:50,458
Here we go.

901
01:12:56,125 --> 01:13:01,333
There are still a few kilometers to go.
Look'.  Verdi maybe if someone follows us?

902
01:13:04,541 --> 01:13:07,375
No, but I believe there is a helicopter.

903
01:13:07,458 --> 01:13:09,666
[helicopter engine]

904
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,541
[Nikki] And I think he's following us.

905
01:13:12,041 --> 01:13:13,958
[Eve] We need to get to the dam.

906
01:13:16,583 --> 01:13:20,333
[TV] We tracked Dr. Carter
and her daughter aboard a

907
01:13:20,416 --> 01:13:24,541
stolen police car.  Ms. Carter
is found guilty of causing

908
01:13:24,625 --> 01:13:28,500
the explosions at PK
plants thus causing the

909
01:13:28,583 --> 01:13:30,125
seismic fire that spreads
throughout the country.

910
01:13:30,208 --> 01:13:33,833
We have Declan Glas,
the CEO of PK, online.

911
01:13:33,916 --> 01:13:36,500
Declan, does he want to tell us what's going on?

912
01:13:36,583 --> 01:13:39,458
[Declan] Eve Carter is a
very dangerous subject.

913
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:44,208
She is the only one to blame
for this disaster and I will

914
01:13:44,291 --> 01:13:47,541
personally stop her before she
can cause more irreparable damage.

915
01:13:51,125 --> 01:13:52,375
[Eve] I have to hurry.

916
01:13:55,291 --> 01:13:58,125
Nikki, you stay here
until the police arrive.

917
01:13:58,208 --> 01:14:01,500
We don't talk about it.
I want to come with you.  We are a team.

918
01:14:01,583 --> 01:14:02,666
Ok.

919
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:04,750
Here we go!

920
01:14:05,666 --> 01:14:06,708
[Eve] Be careful!

921
01:14:29,708 --> 01:14:31,041
[Eve] Come on, run!

922
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:34,333
[Nikki] Mom, let's go!

923
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:41,333
[radio] Delta One,
Delta One, take note.

924
01:14:41,416 --> 01:14:45,041
Dr. Carter and her
daughter entered the dam.

925
01:14:45,125 --> 01:14:48,666
This is Delta One.
We are coming to the north entrance.

926
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:49,750
Received.

927
01:14:49,833 --> 01:14:52,458
Delta Two, I'm entering from the south side.

928
01:14:53,541 --> 01:14:55,291
Delta One, received.

929
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:07,541
- [man 1] Come on, let's move!
- [man 2] Come on, come on!

930
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:10,291
Okay, let's try to
find the control room.

931
01:15:10,375 --> 01:15:13,250
Already.  I saw
four gates when we

932
01:15:13,333 --> 01:15:15,166
entered and this is
probably one of the...

933
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:16,250
[shot]

934
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:17,541
Maybe, it's here.  Here we go!

935
01:15:17,625 --> 01:15:20,125
The show begins, guys.
Arms out!

936
01:15:20,208 --> 01:15:21,333
Go Go go!

937
01:15:22,125 --> 01:15:23,333
Come on come on!

938
01:15:38,666 --> 01:15:43,875
[tv] Soldiers are entering
the dam to capture Dr. Carter.

939
01:15:46,666 --> 01:15:50,625
Meanwhile, forest fires
are ravaging the country.

940
01:15:50,708 --> 01:15:56,500
The Helios from the PK incident continues
to burn threatening to destroy Prague.

941
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:06,291
US President Barack Obama
has sent numerous troops to aid the

942
01:16:06,375 --> 01:16:11,333
Czech population, but the fire
continues to spread endlessly.

943
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:13,958
Hurry up!

944
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:30,958
- Can you use that?
- Your father taught me that.

945
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:40,250
They are shooting.  I
repeat, they are shooting!

946
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:46,041
Honey, over here!

947
01:17:00,625 --> 01:17:02,750
I think the control
room is up there.

948
01:17:02,833 --> 01:17:04,291
- OK let's go.
- Here we go.

949
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:10,083
- Are you OK?
- Yup.

950
01:17:10,166 --> 01:17:12,625
- Are you sure?
- I'm fine.  Go Go!

951
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:14,375
We're almost there, we're almost there!

952
01:17:16,166 --> 01:17:17,375
Come on, honey!

953
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,208
Ok.

954
01:17:25,916 --> 01:17:28,916
Slater, you go ahead.
Then, Copper and finally me.

955
01:17:28,958 --> 01:17:32,208
Ninth.  Not this time, Killian.

956
01:17:32,291 --> 01:17:35,916
- I'm claustrophobic, I can't.
- We just have to cross.

957
01:17:35,958 --> 01:17:37,083
No.

958
01:17:41,041 --> 01:17:45,041
Wait a moment.  I see a light above
the tunnel.  Perhaps, there is the exit!

959
01:18:07,541 --> 01:18:08,625
Stay down!

960
01:18:19,708 --> 01:18:20,875
Wait for me there.

961
01:18:22,333 --> 01:18:25,416
- You have to drain the pelvis.
- I have not understood.  What he wants?

962
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,666
You have to... empty the dam!

963
01:18:28,625 --> 01:18:31,416
We are trying to prevent it.
Earthquakes are...

964
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:35,750
They are caused by underground
fires that need to be put out now!

965
01:18:35,833 --> 01:18:38,625
- How did she get in?
- Do as I tell you!

966
01:18:38,708 --> 01:18:42,333
- It will flood the whole valley.
- Not exactly.

967
01:18:42,416 --> 01:18:46,125
If I release the water from the
dam, it will flow downstream into the

968
01:18:46,208 --> 01:18:50,541
earth and thus put out the fires in
the mines.  We have to do it now!

969
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:54,291
- Madam, she's crazy.
- So, what do I do?

970
01:18:54,375 --> 01:18:55,500
Madam, please.

971
01:19:00,833 --> 01:19:05,125
Open that valve, activate the
power knob and lower the lever.

972
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:09,000
Ok.  You!  Go open the valve.  Go!

973
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,166
Come on, let's get moving!  Come on come on come on!

974
01:19:22,541 --> 01:19:23,875
Do it, mom!

975
01:19:26,291 --> 01:19:28,291
Carter!

976
01:19:29,041 --> 01:19:32,041
- Do not move!
- You son of a bitch!

977
01:19:32,125 --> 01:19:34,833
- Won't you shoot me?
- There will be a trial.

978
01:19:35,958 --> 01:19:38,333
A mad army will not
be credible as a witness.

979
01:19:38,416 --> 01:19:40,875
Yes, but you won't get away with it.
There will be Killian.

980
01:19:40,958 --> 01:19:43,208
-He died.
- Are you really sure?

981
01:19:44,375 --> 01:19:46,541
I swear I'll shoot her in the head now!

982
01:19:52,166 --> 01:19:54,500
All the men in position now!

983
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:57,708
I'm going.  You, follow me.

984
01:20:07,333 --> 01:20:10,375
- Declan, don't you dare!
- Now, I'll shoot her!

985
01:20:10,458 --> 01:20:11,916
- Don't try!
- It's over, Eve!

986
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,333
Don't touch it, let it go!

987
01:20:14,208 --> 01:20:16,833
- What are you waiting for, captain?
- Put the gun down!

988
01:20:16,916 --> 01:20:20,541
- Now, Dr. Carter!
- I can not do that.  Listen to me!

989
01:20:20,625 --> 01:20:21,916
- Come on, shoot her!
- No!

990
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,375
He knows what he is doing!

991
01:20:26,375 --> 01:20:27,833
[explosion]

992
01:20:28,458 --> 01:20:30,625
- Fuck!
- [Slater] It's all collapsing!

993
01:20:31,333 --> 01:20:32,875
[alarm]

994
01:20:33,708 --> 01:20:36,458
- No!
- Fire!

995
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:41,250
- Force!  You go!
- Go!

996
01:20:50,750 --> 01:20:52,250
Don't lower that lever!

997
01:20:59,333 --> 01:21:03,791
- Tell the truth about how it went.
- No, I'm not leaving you here!

998
01:21:07,541 --> 01:21:09,416
Mom, are you okay?  Mom!

999
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:11,500
I beg you!

1000
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:19,250
Tell... Carter I love her!

1001
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:31,541
- It worked?
- I do not know.

1002
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:38,750
[man] The water is putting out the fire!

1003
01:22:03,916 --> 01:22:05,000
Yup!

1004
01:22:07,583 --> 01:22:10,458
Let's get out of here, come on!  Take her out.

1005
01:22:12,041 --> 01:22:14,666
- I want to stay with her.
- I love you!

1006
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:15,833
Me too!

1007
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:24,291
[Nikki] This is the blog of truth.

1008
01:22:24,375 --> 01:22:28,166
I never really knew the woman
who brought me into the world.

1009
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:30,958
She left when I was very small.

1010
01:22:32,083 --> 01:22:35,458
In all these years I have
looked for every reason to

1011
01:22:35,541 --> 01:22:38,291
hate her and I thought that
this was enough to know her.

1012
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:40,833
- Mum mum!
- [Eve] Everything will be fine!

1013
01:22:40,916 --> 01:22:43,583
[Nikki] They wanted to give her 20 years in prison!

1014
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:44,875
She will be fine!

1015
01:22:44,958 --> 01:22:47,875
[Nikki] I thought we could
never make up for lost time.

1016
01:22:47,958 --> 01:22:50,291
[Hill] Let's take it
all and go, guys.

1017
01:23:01,916 --> 01:23:04,833
[Nikki] But two technicians
survived the seismic

1018
01:23:04,916 --> 01:23:07,875
fire and told everyone
what really happened.

1019
01:23:33,625 --> 01:23:38,333
[Nikki] Thousands of people died,
but Eve managed to save just as many.

1020
01:23:38,416 --> 01:23:40,750
She is considered a heroine
in the Czech Republic.

1021
01:23:40,833 --> 01:23:44,000
Declan's death ended
the investigation.

1022
01:23:44,083 --> 01:23:46,916
Perhaps, we will never
find out why he did all this.

1023
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,000
The country is moving forward and
being reborn, just like me and Eve.

1024
01:23:59,583 --> 01:24:01,250
FROM NIKI AND EVE HEALTHY CHOICE

1025
01:24:01,333 --> 01:24:04,500
Good evening, welcome to Nikki and Eve.
Have you booked for two?

1026
01:24:04,583 --> 01:24:05,791
- Yes.
- Follow me.

1027
01:24:09,041 --> 01:24:10,458
This is your table.

1028
01:24:11,625 --> 01:24:14,625
[Nikki] Eve has received
important job offers.

1029
01:24:14,708 --> 01:24:17,041
I get a ticket back to California.

1030
01:24:17,833 --> 01:24:21,208
But we, on the other hand,
have chosen to stay together.

1031
01:24:25,375 --> 01:24:29,000
We have faced a lot of things
in the last few months but

1032
01:24:29,083 --> 01:24:33,458
the reality is that we have
to make up for a lifetime.

1033
01:24:36,291 --> 01:24:39,500
- So, would you like to order?
- Turkey.

1034
01:24:39,583 --> 01:24:43,625
Turkey is good, but the
veggie stew is a blast.

1035
01:24:44,875 --> 01:24:45,875
Mom?

1036
01:24:49,625 --> 01:24:51,291
- Turkey be it!
- Okay.

1037
01:24:58,458 --> 01:24:59,458
What are you doing?

1038
01:25:01,208 --> 01:25:03,708
I write on the blog.  And what are you doing?

1039
01:25:05,791 --> 01:25:08,916
[Nikki] Now, we are a
family, just like Dad wanted.

1040
01:25:08,958 --> 01:25:12,875
I have learned to leave the past
behind and accept it for what it is.

1041
01:25:12,958 --> 01:25:14,541
She is my heroine.

1042
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:17,541
She is my mom.

1043
01:25:22,833 --> 01:25:27,291
Dad, wherever you are, I know
you are watching us from up there.

1044
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:29,708
We love you!
