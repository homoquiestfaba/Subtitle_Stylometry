1
00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:19,087
We have with us today a man who
is so much a part of the culture...

2
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:21,089
that he scarcely needs
an introduction.

3
00:00:21,173 --> 00:00:23,091
Pootie Tang.
Good to have you here with us.

4
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:24,885
Sepatown.

5
00:00:24,968 --> 00:00:26,470
You've had incredible success...

6
00:00:26,553 --> 00:00:28,472
and you've had it
in a variety of fields--

7
00:00:28,555 --> 00:00:32,601
music, films,
martial arts, pottery.

8
00:00:32,684 --> 00:00:34,352
How do you do it?

9
00:00:34,394 --> 00:00:36,521
Well, Bob, I'm a pone toni.

10
00:00:36,563 --> 00:00:39,399
- Got my dillies on a peppatain.
- I hear that.

11
00:00:39,441 --> 00:00:44,613
Now, Pootie, a lot of young artists
say that you are their inspiration.

12
00:00:44,696 --> 00:00:46,907
Well, I can't say
the nay-no, my brother.

13
00:00:47,657 --> 00:00:49,075
Wa-da-tah.

14
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:50,702
You got a new movie
coming out, right?

15
00:00:50,744 --> 00:00:56,124
Yeah. Yes, it's called
Sine Your Pitty on the Runny Kine.

16
00:00:56,208 --> 00:01:00,086
- And who's in it besides yourself?
- Oh, well, there's Trucky...

17
00:01:00,128 --> 00:01:02,464
Bad Bitty, Dirty Dee...

18
00:01:02,547 --> 00:01:05,258
Lacey, J B...

19
00:01:05,342 --> 00:01:09,387
Biggie Shorty
and Robert Vaughn.

20
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:11,723
- You have a clip to show us?
- Yeah, baby.

21
00:01:11,765 --> 00:01:14,100
All right, let's take
a look then at this clip...

22
00:01:14,184 --> 00:01:18,939
from Pootie Tang's new movie,
{y:i}Sine Your Pitty on the Runny Kine.

23
00:01:26,905 --> 00:01:30,075
{Y:i}It was the year 2001.

24
00:01:30,117 --> 00:01:34,079
{Y:i}It was the best of times.
It was the worst of times.

25
00:01:35,831 --> 00:01:39,918
{Y:i}The big city was thriving,
but the inner city was dying.

26
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,294
{Y:i}Who was killing it?

27
00:01:41,378 --> 00:01:44,589
{Y:i}This man. Dick Lecter.

28
00:01:44,631 --> 00:01:47,759
{Y:i}The head
of corporate America.

29
00:01:48,593 --> 00:01:52,013
{Y:i}But the people had hope because
they knew that there was one man...

30
00:01:52,097 --> 00:01:53,598
{Y:i}who could fight the power.

31
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,976
{Y:i}One man who could stop
the madness.

32
00:01:56,059 --> 00:01:59,187
{Y:i}One man who could beat
Dick Lecter like the LAPD.

33
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,984
{Y:i}And that man--
that man was Pootie Tang.

34
00:02:09,156 --> 00:02:12,200
{Y:i}See that guy? That's Bad Bitty.

35
00:02:12,284 --> 00:02:15,579
{Y:i}The baddest drug dealer
in town.

36
00:02:15,662 --> 00:02:18,498
Hey, Bad Bitty,
here comes Dirty Dee.

37
00:02:22,002 --> 00:02:24,212
Dirty bastard!

38
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,011
{Y:i}That's Dirty Dee,
the dirtiest dude around.

39
00:02:31,094 --> 00:02:34,639
{Y:i}He handles all
of corporate America's dirty work.

40
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:43,148
{Y:i}Next to Dirty Dee,
that's Froggy, the Enforcer.

41
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:47,194
Yo, Bad Bitty!
How you be?

42
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:50,739
I'm bad, Dirty Dee.
You're still dirty, I can see.

43
00:02:51,573 --> 00:02:53,241
Let's deal, baby.

44
00:02:53,325 --> 00:02:56,244
- You got yours?
- Froggy.

45
00:02:59,956 --> 00:03:03,168
- It's dirty money.
- You got yours?

46
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:06,213
Right!

47
00:03:06,254 --> 00:03:08,757
But how do I know
if they any good?

48
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:11,134
Let's test'em out.

49
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,263
Hey, kid! Come over here!

50
00:03:15,347 --> 00:03:18,558
{Y:i}That's kid,
the dumbest kidin town.

51
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,062
- What you want, mister?
- Here. Have some of this.

52
00:03:22,103 --> 00:03:24,272
- Is it candy?
{y:i}- Told you.

53
00:03:24,356 --> 00:03:29,945
Yeah. It's the kind of candy
that you smoke out of a pipe.

54
00:03:32,614 --> 00:03:34,783
Pipe candy.

55
00:03:55,846 --> 00:03:57,264
Capachow.

56
00:03:57,305 --> 00:03:59,474

111
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,610
{Y:i}And that town

112
00:08:20,694 --> 00:08:21,987
{Y:i}As he grew...

113
00:08:22,028 --> 00:08:25,991
{Y:i}everyone noticed something different
about the way Pootie would talk.

114
00:08:26,074 --> 00:08:29,995
{Y:i}It baffled everyone--
doctors, scientists.

115
00:08:30,036 --> 00:08:31,705
{Y:i}Let me break it down

116
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:36,001

00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:38,170
{Y:i}too cool for words.

118
00:08:42,048 --> 00:08:45,093
{Y:i}Pootie Tang was
the most popular kidin town.

119
00:08:45,177 --> 00:08:47,304
{Y:i}We didn't always know
what he was saying...

120
00:08:47,387 --> 00:08:49,514
{Y:i}but we always knew

121
00:08:49,598 --> 00:08:53,268
{Y:i}Like I knew I was his best friend.
That's me. Trust me.

122
00:08:53,351 --> 00:08:55,854
{Y:i}Yeah, he had
a special effect on people...

123
00:08:55,937 --> 00:08:58,106
{Y:i}especially on the ladies.

124
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,942
{Y:i}Not girls. Grown-ass women.

125
00:09:01,026 --> 00:09:05,280
- Hiya, Pootie Tang.
- I'm a tine cappy, my damie.

126
00:09:08,241 --> 00:09:11,077
- All right, Pootie Tang.
{y:i}- But for some of the ladies...

127
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:13,872
{Y:i}Pootie was just
too hot to handle.

128
00:09:13,914 --> 00:09:15,957
Damn you, Pootie Tang!

129
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,959
I can't take no more of this!

130
00:09:18,043 --> 00:09:20,921
Who do you think you are,
treatin' me this way?

131
00:09:20,962 --> 00:09:24,716
I've had it with you! You hear me
talkin' to you with your nappy head!

132
00:09:24,758 --> 00:09:27,844
This is it!
I'm finished with you!

133
00:09:27,928 --> 00:09:30,639
Get out of my life,
Pootie Tang!

134
00:09:30,722 --> 00:09:33,558
You think I'm jokin'?
Take your shit!

135
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,772
Take your shit and get out,
Pootie Tang! I'm sick of you!

136
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:45,070
Pootie-- Pootie, don't go.

137
00:09:57,332 --> 00:09:59,334
{Y:i}Pootie Tang
was an only child.

138
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:02,921
{Y:i}His father, Daddy Tang,
worked hard to raise Pootie right.

139
00:10:03,004 --> 00:10:06,007
{Y:i}He had this belt.
He was so fast with that belt...

140
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:09,803
{Y:i}that before Pootie could do wrong,
Daddy Tang would set him right.

141
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,433
Don't you grab them peas
without askin' your mama, boy.

142
00:10:15,475 --> 00:10:18,103
May I dane on the cherries,
Mama Di?

143
00:10:18,812 --> 00:10:21,189
Yes, you may, Pootie Tang.

144
00:10:21,857 --> 00:10:23,024
That's better.

145
00:10:23,108 --> 00:10:26,778
You got to have respect
to get respect, Pootie Tang.

146
00:10:28,321 --> 00:10:31,867
So, do you have any girlfriends
at school, Pootie?

147
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,912
Aw, Mama Di. There's a sine
tippi in a classi-ti.

148
00:10:35,996 --> 00:10:38,165
She's a cole toni.

149
00:10:38,248 --> 00:10:41,168
Don't you talk dirty
to your mama, boy.

150
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:43,795
Always got your head
in them girls.

151
00:10:43,837 --> 00:10:45,839
You need to have
your head in the books.

152
00:10:45,881 --> 00:10:47,841
Leave the ladies alone.

153
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,302
{Y:i}And that's the way it was.

154
00:10:50,343 --> 00:10:52,387
{Y:i}Daddy Tang and his belt
was always there...

155
00:10:52,471 --> 00:10:56,141
{Y:i}teaching Pootie the difference
between good and bad.

156
00:10:56,224 --> 00:11:00,645
{Y:i}Now, when I say he was always there,
I mean he was always there.

157
00:11:02,355 --> 00:11:06,193
Hey, Pootie, let's
steal some apples.

158
00:11:14,034 --> 00:11:17,037
{Y:i}When Pootie was only six,
his mother died...

159
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:19,289
{Y:i}Leaving him
and his father alone.

160
00:11:19,372 --> 00:11:22,501
{y:i}- Pootie was very sad.
- I know, son.

161
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:25,629
{Y:i}But his father
was a comfort to him.

162
00:11:25,712 --> 00:11:27,631
Don't slurp your soup
in here, boy.

163
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:33,804
{Y:i}Two weeks later,
another terrible tragedy.

164
00:11:33,887 --> 00:11:36,848
{Y:i}His father was fatally injured
at the steel mill.

165
00:11:38,975 --> 00:11:41,770
What the fu--

166
00:11:41,853 --> 00:11:44,523
Gorilla! Gorilla!

167
00:11:44,606 --> 00:11:46,566
{Y:i}It was incredible.

168
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:50,403
{Y:i}Only the third man to be mauled
by a gorilla at that steel mill.

169
00:11:53,406 --> 00:11:57,452
{Y:i}On his deathbed, Daddy Tang
had Pootie make a solemn promise.

170
00:11:58,662 --> 00:12:00,622
Pootie...

171
00:12:00,705 --> 00:12:04,042
I know
I brought you up tough...

172
00:12:04,084 --> 00:12:06,086
but that's
'cause I love you.

173
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:09,798
It's tough
out there, Pootie.

174
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:14,719
You got drugs,
crime, gorillas.

175
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:16,721
Yeah.

176
00:12:17,973 --> 00:12:22,936
I ain't gonna be here much longer,
so I'm gonna give you this.

177
00:12:24,437 --> 00:12:27,274
Pootie, that's my belt.

178
00:12:28,108 --> 00:12:31,278
As long as you got
right on your side...

179
00:12:31,361 --> 00:12:35,657
you could whoop anyone's ass
with just that belt.

180
00:12:38,577 --> 00:12:41,413
I know
you love the ladies...

181
00:12:41,455 --> 00:12:44,291
and Lord knows
the ladies love you.

182
00:12:45,592 --> 00:12:49,529
Don't let the ladies
come between you and the belt.

183
00:12:50,057 --> 00:12:53,060
{Y:i}Those were Daddy Tang's
last words.:

184
00:12:56,528 --> 00:12:59,771
{Y:i}"Don't let the ladies
come between you and the belt."

185
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,573
{Y:i}But there was something
else about the ladies...

186
00:13:05,657 --> 00:13:08,243
{Y:i}that Daddy Tang forgot
to tell little Pootie.

187
00:13:12,705 --> 00:13:15,500
{Y:i}Pootie Tang
turned out just fine.

188
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:17,919
{Y:i}Daddy Tang
would have been proud.

189
00:13:18,002 --> 00:13:21,381
{Y:i}Pootie had it all--
hit records, movies...

190
00:13:21,464 --> 00:13:23,424
{Y:i}magazine covers, fancy cars...

191
00:13:23,508 --> 00:13:26,344
{Y:i}famous friends, beautiful
custom-made clothes...

192
00:13:26,386 --> 00:13:29,264
{Y:i}and ladies, ladies, ladies.

193
00:13:31,099 --> 00:13:35,603
{Y:i}Through it all, I was right there
by his side. That's me. Trucky.

194
00:13:35,687 --> 00:13:37,355
{Y:i}And that's my man,
Pootie Tang.

195
00:13:39,858 --> 00:13:42,527
{Y:i}Big-time celebrity,
ass-kickin' crime fighter...

196
00:13:42,569 --> 00:13:44,529
{Y:i}and role model
to the children.

197
00:13:44,571 --> 00:13:46,990
{Y:i}Pootie Tang has a message...

198
00:13:47,073 --> 00:13:48,825
{Y:i}for the children of America...

199
00:13:48,908 --> 00:13:52,662
{Y:i}so you better
wapatah to the bammies 'cause:

200
00:13:55,707 --> 00:14:00,503
{Y:i}Pootie says cigarettes and fast-food
burgers are bad like netatai.

201
00:14:00,587 --> 00:14:05,717
{Y:i}Don't drink malt liquor 'cause you
don't need to 'cause you're okay.

202
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:09,179
{Y:i}Sa da tay. Also, eat
all your vegetables...

203
00:14:09,262 --> 00:14:13,725
{Y:i}and don't bang the dillies.

204
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,740
{Y:i}That's Frank,
Dick Lecter's right-handman.

205
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:31,576
So what do we care?

206
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:34,412
We care because
he's making these.

207
00:14:34,454 --> 00:14:38,666
People have been making PSAs
for years. Hasn't made a difference.

208
00:14:41,544 --> 00:14:44,172
Eddie, hit me
with those figures.

209
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:47,258
Since the inception
of Pootie Tang's PSA campaign...

210
00:14:47,342 --> 00:14:50,929
sales of Lecter burgers
are down 30%...

211
00:14:51,012 --> 00:14:53,348
Lecter cigarettes
down 20%...

212
00:14:53,431 --> 00:14:55,433
and Lecter whiskey...

213
00:14:55,517 --> 00:14:57,310
almost out of business.

214
00:14:57,393 --> 00:15:00,605
For the first time, somebody's getting
to these kids, and it's killing us.

215
00:15:00,647 --> 00:15:02,440
It's killing us.

216
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:04,943
{Y:i}It's killing us.

217
00:15:15,036 --> 00:15:16,621
Hello, Mr. Lecter.

218
00:15:16,663 --> 00:15:19,666
{Y:i}Frank, I have a job for you.

219
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:21,209
Yes, sir.

220
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:23,962
I tell you, man, Pootie Tang
is one bad brother, man.

221
00:15:24,003 --> 00:15:28,007
{Y:i}That's J.B. and Lacey.
We make up Pootie's crew.

222
00:15:28,091 --> 00:15:32,262
Pootie Tang will draw you a picture
of how he's gonna kick your ass...

223
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:34,806
then mail it to you
ten days in advance.

224
00:15:34,848 --> 00:15:36,808
The picture
gets there, right?

225
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,810
You go,
"What the hell is this?"

226
00:15:38,852 --> 00:15:42,313
Then Pootie Tang knocks on your
door, properly kicks your ass...

227
00:15:42,397 --> 00:15:44,357
and you still won't know
what happened to you.

228
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,652
You got that right.
He is a kick-ass artiste.

229
00:15:47,735 --> 00:15:50,071
Know what I'm sayin'?
He like the Da Vinci of ass-kicking.

230
00:15:50,154 --> 00:15:53,992
That sounds kind of good. Pootie
Tang, the Da Vinci of ass-kicking.

231
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:56,494
Aw, man, Pootie Tang
whoop your ass so bad...

232
00:15:56,536 --> 00:15:58,496
that you could
write it off on your taxes.

233
00:15:58,538 --> 00:16:01,875
That's right. You got right here,
ass-whooping number one...

234
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,168
ass-whooping number two.

235
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:06,004
This here, you can't write that
off. That's just gettin' beat up.

236
00:16:06,087 --> 00:16:11,342
I like to also add that Pootie Tang
can kick some ass too, boy.

237
00:16:11,384 --> 00:16:15,680
Oh, here come Pootie Tang now.
Hey! Pootie Tang! All right!

238
00:16:15,722 --> 00:16:19,184
- We was just talkin' about you.
- All right, Pootie Tang!

239
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:22,145
Pootie Tang, you going to Biggie
Shorty's party tomorrow, man?

240
00:16:22,228 --> 00:16:24,772
{Y:i}I guess you're wonderin',
who is Biggie Shorty?

241
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:30,528
I'm Biggie Shorty.

242
00:16:32,113 --> 00:16:34,532
Let me tell you
about me and Pootie Tang.

243
00:16:36,618 --> 00:16:40,872
Since the very day we met,
I knew Pootie was to be my man.

244
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:46,586
I knew all I had
to do was wait...

245
00:16:49,756 --> 00:16:53,551
and one day all that bullshit
would catch up with Pootie...

246
00:16:53,593 --> 00:16:55,637
and he would be mine.

247
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,972
Hey, man, you going to Biggie
Shorty's party tomorrow, man?

248
00:16:58,056 --> 00:16:59,891
Ranacan.

249
00:17:01,017 --> 00:17:04,437
- We gonna party tomorrow, man.
- There's gonna be bitches there.

250
00:17:06,731 --> 00:17:10,151
You right. You right. Respect
the women. Respect the women.

251
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:19,911
- Look at that car!
- Damn that car big!

252
00:17:19,994 --> 00:17:23,414
And long
like an old snake.

253
00:17:23,456 --> 00:17:25,959
Man, that car's so big,
it's got its own sky.

254
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,920
Yeah, it's big too.

255
00:17:29,963 --> 00:17:32,507
- Keep it running.
- Yes, sir.

256
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,592
Hiya, fellas.

257
00:17:34,634 --> 00:17:37,512
- Kinda hot for a hootenanny, huh?
- You hear that?

258
00:17:37,595 --> 00:17:41,224
A hootenanny? What the hell
is a damn hootenanny?

259
00:17:41,307 --> 00:17:44,310
I'm looking
for Pootie Tang.

260
00:17:44,394 --> 00:17:47,438
Pootie Tang? What you want
with Pootie Tang?

261
00:17:47,522 --> 00:17:51,150
I need to talk to him.

262
00:17:52,318 --> 00:17:54,112
All right, look, Pootie.

263
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:57,156
I'm a representative of Lecter Corp.
Do you know what that is?

264
00:17:58,366 --> 00:18:00,493
Great.
Well, Dick Lecter...

265
00:18:00,577 --> 00:18:04,122
the CEO, mind you,
of Lecter Corp., he likes you.

266
00:18:04,205 --> 00:18:08,376
He likes you, Pootie, and he wants
to make you a very rich, rich man.

267
00:18:08,459 --> 00:18:12,338
I have a contract here
for Pootie to endorse.

268
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,300
Tasty Heavy
Pork Chunk Cereal.

269
00:18:15,341 --> 00:18:18,052
It's delicious. It's a wonderful
product. Kids love it.

270
00:18:18,136 --> 00:18:22,056
And kids love you.
We just wanna put that together.

271
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:27,854
That's a canapan
to the semachai.

272
00:18:27,937 --> 00:18:30,440
I didn't even tell you
how much it pays, Pootie.

273
00:18:30,523 --> 00:18:33,401
Twenty million dollars
to sign with us for just one year.

274
00:18:33,484 --> 00:18:36,779
Oh, what do you say,
Pootie?

275
00:18:36,863 --> 00:18:39,115
I got to say
the nay-no, my brother.

276
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:41,910
- Wa-da-tah.
- Wa-da-tah?

277
00:18:41,993 --> 00:18:45,580
How do you say the nay-no
to 20 million? Why?

278
00:18:45,663 --> 00:18:49,250
Maybe Pootie don't wanna sign
because he knows you're full of it.

279
00:18:49,334 --> 00:18:53,755
Yeah. First of all, he knows
that cereal's full of sugar.

280
00:18:53,838 --> 00:18:56,841
And number two, that's not all
that you guys sell.

281
00:18:56,883 --> 00:19:02,555
You sell cigarettes, whiskey,
Bad Time burgers, switchblades.

282
00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:07,143
It also says here that you will no
longer have Pootie doing PSA's...

283
00:19:07,227 --> 00:19:09,938
telling the kids to eat
healthy and to be smart.

284
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:12,148
Well, sure, exclusivity
goes without saying.

285
00:19:12,232 --> 00:19:15,860
I'm sure your ugly intentions
go without saying.

286
00:19:15,944 --> 00:19:17,904
Take a walk, money man.

287
00:19:22,116 --> 00:19:27,163
See, my damie, Pootie Tang don't
wa-da-tah to the shama cow...

288
00:19:27,247 --> 00:19:31,209
'cause that's a cama
cama leepa-chaiii, dig?

289
00:19:31,292 --> 00:19:34,462
Hey, Tang, to you, they're children.
To me, they're dollar signs.

290
00:19:39,926 --> 00:19:41,219
Cover your grill.

291
00:19:41,302 --> 00:19:42,762
Sa da tay!

292
00:19:49,102 --> 00:19:50,103
Aw, man!

293
00:19:50,144 --> 00:19:52,522
You funny, man.
You are a funny man.

294
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:54,524
You's a wild boy.

295
00:19:54,607 --> 00:19:57,318
{Y:i}Pootie smacked the taste
out of Frank's mouth.

296
00:19:57,402 --> 00:19:59,988
{Y:i}Oh, man, that
was funny to us.

297
00:20:00,071 --> 00:20:05,034
{Y:i}But there was one man
who was not laughing at all.

298
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:09,080
Pootie Tang goes out there
and makes everybody love him.

299
00:20:10,248 --> 00:20:14,085
He tells them
not to buy my products.

300
00:20:14,127 --> 00:20:16,087
He steals from me.

301
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,089
And what do I do?

302
00:20:18,131 --> 00:20:23,428
I say take my money. Here.
Take it. Fine. Huh?

303
00:20:23,511 --> 00:20:25,471
And he says no.

304
00:20:25,513 --> 00:20:27,974
{Y:i}I guess you're wondering,
who is this bitch here?

305
00:20:28,016 --> 00:20:31,186
{Y:i}That's lreenie,
Dick Lecter's main squeeze...

306
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:34,314
{Y:i}and the most dangerous
woman on the planet.

307
00:20:34,397 --> 00:20:37,525
{Y:i}Now, she don't look it,
but she can bring any man down.

308
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:40,820
I know what makes
Pootie Tang...

309
00:20:40,904 --> 00:20:45,200
tick, tock, tick.

310
00:21:01,341 --> 00:21:04,469
That's cool. All right.

311
00:21:05,428 --> 00:21:08,056
Cut the drums too.

312
00:21:12,727 --> 00:21:15,355
It's all gone now, Pootie.
What do you wanna do?

313
00:21:16,356 --> 00:21:18,066
Lepa time.

314
00:21:22,403 --> 00:21:24,364
What's he got on his mind?

315
00:21:24,405 --> 00:21:26,824
We're starting
from scratch, I guess.

316
00:21:26,866 --> 00:21:28,993
Pootie knows what Pootie do.

317
00:21:29,035 --> 00:21:30,995
This is gonna be good.

318
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,335
Okay, Pootie, I'll play back
the levels the way you set them.

319
00:21:37,377 --> 00:21:40,713
No instruments, no vocals,
no levels, everything silent.

320
00:21:40,797 --> 00:21:42,549
Set it on me. Bleed.

321
00:22:03,194 --> 00:22:06,948
Pootie don't need no words.
Don't even need no music.

322
00:22:21,796 --> 00:22:24,382

How much?

410
00:30:01,478 --> 00:30:03,605
Hey, baby,
what's your problem?

411
00:30:04,356 --> 00:30:06,316
Just 'cause a girl
like to dress fancy...

412
00:30:06,358 --> 00:30:08,318
and stand on a street corner
near some whores...

413
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,320
you automatically
think she's hooking?

414
00:30:10,362 --> 00:30:12,113
Wouldn't you?

415
00:30:12,197 --> 00:30:14,157
No, I wouldn't.

416
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:17,243
I'm a lady,

Oh, yeah! Pootie Tang
and his boys are here!

418
00:30:40,684 --> 00:30:43,853
Yo, man, a Biggie Shorty party
is exclusive, man.

419
00:30:43,937 --> 00:30:46,398
They don't let nobody
in a Biggie Shorty party.

420
00:30:46,481 --> 00:30:49,651
They got a line around the block.
Ain't nobody in, man.

421
00:30:49,734 --> 00:30:52,988
You know what? Nobody we know
can get in this party, man.

422
00:30:53,071 --> 00:30:56,074
They don't let no light in.
They don't let no electricity in.

423
00:30:56,157 --> 00:30:58,952
They don't let no water in.
They don't let no air in.

424
00:30:59,035 --> 00:31:02,956
Air is going, "Man, I'm air.
I'm on the list. Let me in."

425
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,459
And they won't let air in.
And you know air gets in everywhere.

426
00:31:06,543 --> 00:31:09,671
That's how exclusive
a Biggie Shorty party is.

427
00:31:09,754 --> 00:31:12,716
You know what else?
It's hard to get in too.

428
00:31:15,593 --> 00:31:17,887
I hate you!

429
00:31:17,971 --> 00:31:21,182

431
00:31:25,895 --> 00:31:27,856
Go, Trucky!

432
00:31:36,948 --> 00:31:41,870
Pretty girl. Pretty girl.

433
00:31:41,911 --> 00:31:43,413
Where you go, girl?

434
00:31:45,457 --> 00:31:50,712
Pootie, you are the sexiest
bastard on God's green earth.

435
00:31:50,795 --> 00:31:53,465
- Yeah.
- I tell you, though.

436
00:31:53,548 --> 00:31:56,426
Someday I'm gonna get me
a piece of you myself.

437
00:31:56,926 --> 00:32:00,430
- Sepatown.
- Sepatown, my ass.

438
00:32:00,513 --> 00:32:03,516
You gonna be inside
of a bed with me someday.

439
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,021
You mark my words,
you skinny, wonderful man.

440
00:32:09,564 --> 00:32:11,858
Pretty girl!

441
00:32:11,942 --> 00:32:13,860
Pretty girl!

442
00:32:13,944 --> 00:32:16,571
Sexy!

443
00:32:16,655 --> 00:32:20,241
Pretty girl? Pretty girl!

444
00:32:21,201 --> 00:32:23,828
How does a woman
get to you anyway?

445
00:32:23,912 --> 00:32:26,873
It's like a state secret.

446
00:32:26,957 --> 00:32:30,543
How to bed Pootie Tang.

447
00:32:31,336 --> 00:32:34,547
Get off him already.
He don't want none of your mess.

448
00:32:39,761 --> 00:32:42,555
I tell you what, Pootie.

449
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:46,226
Someday you gonna meet
your match in a woman.

450
00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:50,647
Someday you gonna meet
the Darth Vader of T. and A.

451
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:55,277
Some woman's gonna kick
your ass and love you to death...

452
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,946
and then you gonna be
lying in the Dumpster...

453
00:32:58,029 --> 00:33:01,116
done banged to death
by the dark side of love.

454
00:33:02,242 --> 00:33:04,452
And on that day, Pootie...

455
00:33:05,787 --> 00:33:08,832
I'm gonna be there.

456
00:33:08,915 --> 00:33:14,129
And I'm gonna make
sweet love to you.

457
00:33:15,046 --> 00:33:16,131
Sexy girl!

458
00:33:16,172 --> 00:33:18,133
- Damn, man.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

459
00:33:18,174 --> 00:33:21,594
I thought she was
somebody else, man. I'm sorry.

460
00:33:21,678 --> 00:33:24,723
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.

461
00:33:28,602 --> 00:33:30,186
Damn. I didn't get

00:33:32,981 --> 00:33:36,443
Damn. Do I know you?

463
00:33:36,526 --> 00:33:37,986
Do you want me
to pull your legs off?

464
00:33:38,028 --> 00:33:40,322
- Pardon me?
- You wanna make out?

465
00:33:40,363 --> 00:33:44,451
I might enjoy that.
I just might enjoy that.

466
00:33:44,534 --> 00:33:49,205
I might enjoy that. You know,
I just might enjoy that.

467
00:33:55,211 --> 00:33:57,631
Shut up!

468
00:33:58,757 --> 00:34:01,343
Okay, wait a minute.

Wait, wait, wait.

Look here. Call me a sissy,
but you need to stop, baby.

00:34:07,641 --> 00:34:09,559
You are tearing me apart.
You're killing me.

472
00:34:09,643 --> 00:34:11,561
- You want me to stop?
- Well, yes, I do.

473
00:34:11,645 --> 00:34:15,398
Okay, then,
you tell me something.

474
00:34:15,482 --> 00:34:19,069
- What do you wanna know?
- What's Pootie's secret?

475
00:34:21,988 --> 00:34:23,031
I can't tell you that.

476
00:34:23,114 --> 00:34:26,576
{Y:i}Now, I would never do
anything to hurt Pootie Tang.

477
00:34:26,618 --> 00:34:30,330
{Y:i}But like I said, Ireenie knew
how to break a brother down.

478
00:34:30,413 --> 00:34:33,541
- I can't tell you that.
- You can't? All right.

479
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:41,257
Okay, wait. I'll tell you.

I'll tell you.
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

00:34:44,511 --> 00:34:46,888
It's the belt.
It's the belt.

482
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:49,099
It's magical.

483
00:34:49,182 --> 00:34:52,727
He can kick anybody's ass
with that damn belt.

484
00:34:58,316 --> 00:34:57,565
Freeze, sucker!

485
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:05,188

00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:10,944
Wa-da-tah,

488
00:35:11,027 --> 00:35:14,864
Hey, I'm not your damie. Now, give

489
00:35:18,076 --> 00:35:22,205
Hey, I told you to back off!

490
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:38,847
Pootie, the craziest thing
just happened to me.

491
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:42,934
I'm in the club, man.
I'm-- Pootie, look out.

492
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:47,147
Bang! Bang! Bang!

493
00:35:59,117 --> 00:36:02,203
Pootie?
Everything under control?

494
00:36:05,165 --> 00:36:07,375
Kayed a brother, di.

495
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:09,878
Kayed a brother, di!

496
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:12,505
I'm a shamey day!

497
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:14,883
I'm a shamey day!

498
00:36:17,427 --> 00:36:20,639
Oh, it hurts Pootie
to kill a man...

499
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:22,891
but he knows
he's got to do it.

500
00:36:22,974 --> 00:36:25,685
But it hurts him so bad...

501
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:27,687
to right those wrongs.

502
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:30,065
My man Pootie Tang!

503
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:41,034
Come back
on the bettie tai!

504
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:44,079
Come back on
the bettie tai!

505
00:36:44,162 --> 00:36:47,457
Come back
on the bettie tai!

506
00:36:55,298 --> 00:36:58,301
Hey, all right, my damie.

507
00:36:58,426 --> 00:37:02,305
Why didn't Trucky tell Pootie that
he told Ireenie all his business?

508
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:03,890
Just runnin' his mouth.

509
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:06,977
I guess when you see a man
being brought back from the dead...

510
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,979
you forget shit.

511
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:11,106
Or maybe you just
a dumb-ass.

512
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:22,409
{Y:i}Stop the movie. Remember when
Daddy Tang told little Pootie--

513
00:37:22,492 --> 00:37:26,496
Don't let the ladies
come between you and the belt.

514
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:30,792
{Y:i}Well, what Daddy Tang forgot to tell
Pootie was about his only weakness.:

515
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:31,835
{Y:i}ho's.

516
00:37:31,918 --> 00:37:35,130
{Y:i}Even Pootie Tang's belt
was no match for Ireenie.

517
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:38,925
{Y:i}You can't beat a ho' with a belt.
They like that shit.

518
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:57,986
I'm sorry.
Did my cart hit your cart?

519
00:37:58,028 --> 00:38:01,698
I'm so sorry about that.

520
00:38:09,456 --> 00:38:12,375
Did I hurt you?

521
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:15,128
Oh, what a drag.

522
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,756
Again, I am...

523
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,425
very sorry!

524
00:38:44,824 --> 00:38:48,203
Pootie, will you do
something for me?

525
00:38:48,244 --> 00:38:51,039
Will you do something
for Ireenie?

526
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:56,878
Sign your pretty name.

527
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:04,594
Sign it.

528
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:08,223
Sign it. Sign it.

529
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:10,392
Sign it.

530
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,318
He signed it.

531
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:28,952
He signed it.

532
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:31,955
He signed it. Oh, God.

533
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:35,959
Signed it?
Nice job, Ireenie.

534
00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:38,795
You're a damn genius, baby.

535
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:41,589
"I, Pootie Tang, do surrender
to Lecter Corp...

536
00:39:41,673 --> 00:39:44,926
all the rights to
my image and likeness."

537
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:46,469
Oh, yes, yes.

538
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:48,553
"I will whole heartedly endorse
all Lecter Corp. products...

539
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,558
and will do my best to convince
the children of the world...

540
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,977
that the above mentioned
are all clean, safe...

541
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,479
and should be bought
and used by all of them."

542
00:39:56,563 --> 00:40:00,483
No, not
the tippi tais, no.

543
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:03,778
No, no. You are part of the
corporation, just like us.

544
00:40:04,654 --> 00:40:06,656
Thought you could stay
out of it, huh?

545
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:10,076
Welcome aboard,
Pootie Tang.

546
00:40:11,786 --> 00:40:13,955
Are you looking
for something, my friend?

547
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:18,501
Are you?
I've got it all now.

548
00:40:18,543 --> 00:40:22,213
Shocking news today as beloved
Pootie Tang has agreed to endorse...

549
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:25,592
several controversial
products for Lecter Corp....

550
00:40:25,675 --> 00:40:27,761
the infamous
giant corporation.

551
00:40:27,844 --> 00:40:30,472
Yo, fellas, somethin' on the TV
about Pootie Tang.

552
00:40:30,513 --> 00:40:32,599
{Y:i}Even my kids, man, looked up
to him. You know what I mean?

553
00:40:32,682 --> 00:40:36,436
{Y:i}They don't even look at Dad
like they look at him.

554
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:39,648
{Y:i}But now since he crossed,
man, my little--

555
00:40:39,689 --> 00:40:41,691
{Y:i}my little man came up to me
the other day and was like...

556
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:43,693
{Y:i}"Man, how could he do
that bullshit, man?

557
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:45,695
{Y:i}-- that--"
I'm lookin' at him like, "Whoa."

558
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:59,959
{Y:i}Pootie Tang has made my children
cry. I'll not support him anymore.

559
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:02,921
{Y:i}Lecter Corp. effectively owns
the name Pootie Tang...

560
00:41:03,004 --> 00:41:06,508
{Y:i}his image and all copyrights
that go along with it.

561
00:41:07,676 --> 00:41:11,846
Mr. Tang agreed to do commercials
endorsing our sneakers...

562
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,516
food products and cigarettes,
whiskey, mace, switchblades...

563
00:41:14,557 --> 00:41:15,517
rat poison.

564
00:41:15,558 --> 00:41:17,519
Mr. Lecter,
can we have a statement--

565
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:26,027
You know, Biggie Shorty,
I got to say...

566
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:29,447
I always had a high opinion
of Pootie Tang.

567
00:41:29,531 --> 00:41:32,325
But the way things are going now,
not only has he sold out...

568
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:34,327
he's scraping
the bottom of the barrel.

569
00:41:34,411 --> 00:41:38,081
Pootie Tang was drugged
by that crazy-ass Ireenie.

570
00:41:38,164 --> 00:41:40,500
- Haven't you been watchin' the film?
- And that's what disturbs me.

571
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:43,503
He's out there telling kids
not to go to school...

572
00:41:43,586 --> 00:41:46,089
to eat fast food,
to do drugs.

573
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:49,592
This is not the Pootie Tang I
thought I knew and I used to admire.

574
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:53,388
- He would never tell kids that.
- You're in denial.

575
00:41:53,471 --> 00:41:55,682
He's out there doing dirt
to his own reputation.

576
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:59,352
- You don't know Pootie Tang.
- I don't know Pootie Tang?

577
00:41:59,436 --> 00:42:01,354
Believe me,
I know Pootie Tang...

578
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:03,565
and this is not the Pootie Tang
I thought I knew.

579
00:42:03,648 --> 00:42:06,943
I thought a man of your stature
would have better sense...

580
00:42:07,027 --> 00:42:08,945
than to fall
for no mess like that.

581
00:42:10,947 --> 00:42:13,825
Look, this thing
has all fallen apart.

582
00:42:13,908 --> 00:42:17,162
The man used to be admired
by people of all walks of life.

583
00:42:17,245 --> 00:42:19,581
And you know what?

584
00:42:19,622 --> 00:42:23,501
If the world is gonna fall for
this mess about my Pootie Tang...

585
00:42:23,585 --> 00:42:25,879
then maybe the world
don't deserve Pootie Tang.

586
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,507
What do you think Pootie Tang
needs at this point in his life?

587
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:32,552
He just needs some
of my good lovin'...

588
00:42:32,636 --> 00:42:34,888
and he will be all right.

589
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:37,057
- You watch.
- I hope you're right.

590
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,434
- I know I'm right.
- Yeah, we'll see.

591
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:41,478
- Yeah, we'll see.
- That's right.

592
00:42:41,561 --> 00:42:43,480
- Watch.
- I will.

593
00:42:55,116 --> 00:42:57,410
{Y:i}Pootie Tang was messed up.

594
00:42:57,494 --> 00:42:59,371
- Punk bitch.
- Sellout.

595
00:43:02,248 --> 00:43:04,751
{y:i}- Look at him. Damn, Pootie!
- Get a job, you bum.

596
00:43:04,834 --> 00:43:09,214
{Y:i}Get it together, man. Pootie
looked like who did it and ran.

597
00:43:09,297 --> 00:43:12,092
{Y:i}Pootie turned to the only woman
who could help him.

598
00:43:29,401 --> 00:43:31,861
Poor Pootie Tang.

599
00:43:33,321 --> 00:43:36,741
That's all right.
Mama's got you.

600
00:43:36,825 --> 00:43:39,077
That's all right.

601
00:43:41,204 --> 00:43:43,748
Biggie Shorty's
gonna take care of you.

602
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:46,042
Don't you worry.

603
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:49,129
Gonna have sex
with you too, you know.

604
00:43:49,212 --> 00:43:51,131
Finally.

605
00:43:58,346 --> 00:44:00,890
Are you sure you
gotta go, Pootie?

606
00:44:00,974 --> 00:44:02,934
Yeah.

607
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:05,478
That's a damn shame.

608
00:44:05,562 --> 00:44:09,065
You were the best piece
of man I ever had.

609
00:44:09,149 --> 00:44:11,693
You know, you could just stay here
and live between my bosoms...

610
00:44:11,776 --> 00:44:15,238
for the rest of your life.

611
00:44:15,322 --> 00:44:18,033
Pootie gotta flittie tai,
Biggie Shorty.

612
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:22,454
Man's gotta do, I suppose.

613
00:44:22,537 --> 00:44:26,166
As long as you gone they can't
make you do no more commercials.

614
00:44:26,249 --> 00:44:27,334
Where you going?

615
00:44:29,878 --> 00:44:34,591
I tell you what. I got a little
farmhouse outside of Greenville.

616
00:44:34,674 --> 00:44:37,844
It was my mama's. It ain't much,
but nobody's livin' there.

617
00:44:37,927 --> 00:44:40,930
You go out there,
find yourself.

618
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:45,185
But then you come
back to me, okay?

619
00:44:45,268 --> 00:44:47,187
That's a fine tine, baby.

620
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:52,025
Give me some of that bony ass one
more time before you hit the road.

621
00:44:59,616 --> 00:45:04,371
Man, I hates prison.
Prison sucks.

622
00:45:04,412 --> 00:45:06,414
I reckon it's supposed to.

623
00:45:08,249 --> 00:45:10,168
You got somethin'
for me?

624
00:45:20,512 --> 00:45:25,058
Oh, this some fine dirt.
This is some good dirt.

625
00:45:25,141 --> 00:45:27,060
You know I'm
gonna hook you up.

626
00:45:27,143 --> 00:45:29,062
Man, I hate
these bastards.

627
00:45:29,145 --> 00:45:31,398
They make me shower
every day.

628
00:45:31,481 --> 00:45:36,987
{Y:i}They never let me get dirty. I need
to be dirty. I'm Dirty Dee, damn it!

629
00:45:39,197 --> 00:45:44,035
You gonna be dirty
again soon. I promise.

630
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:46,204
It's that Pootie Tang.

631
00:45:46,287 --> 00:45:48,873
It's that Pootie Tang.
He got to be stopped.

632
00:45:48,957 --> 00:45:53,753
I'm the one that's got to stop him.
Pootie goddamn Tang!

633
00:45:53,837 --> 00:45:57,090
{Y:i}You gonna, you gotta
You gonna, you gotta

634
00:45:59,050 --> 00:45:59,926
Thank you.

635
00:46:03,346 --> 00:46:06,766
{Y:i}Pootie was headed to the farm.
I wanted to go with him.

636
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:09,436
- I wanna go with you, brother.
{y:i}- Everything was all my fault.

637
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:12,814
Pootie, everything that happened,
man, it's all my fault.

638
00:46:12,856 --> 00:46:16,609
{y:i}- I told that bitch all about him.
- I told this bitch all about you.

639
00:46:16,693 --> 00:46:19,779
{y:i}- She just used it against him.
- And she just used it against you.

640
00:46:19,863 --> 00:46:22,824
{y:i}- I was sorry.
- I'm sorry, man. I'm so sorry.

641
00:46:22,866 --> 00:46:24,659
{y:i}- It was killing me.
- It was killing me.

642
00:46:24,701 --> 00:46:27,370
{y:i}- Only did it for the ass.
- Only did it for her ass.

643
00:46:29,456 --> 00:46:31,875
That deri-teri was
all the dinie, huh?

644
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:34,502
{y:i}- I felt like he saved my life.
- Pootie, man, I just feel like...

645
00:46:34,586 --> 00:46:36,546
you saved my life.

646
00:46:36,588 --> 00:46:39,174
{y:i}- And I messed his all up.
- Now I messed yours all up.

647
00:46:39,257 --> 00:46:43,386
{y:i}- I wanted him to forgive me.
- Can you ever forgive me, man?

648
00:46:46,765 --> 00:46:48,808
You my main damie, man.

649
00:46:51,394 --> 00:46:54,064
Ain't no bad tammie
between us.

650
00:46:54,147 --> 00:46:57,025
{y:i}- I wondered if he meant it.
- You mean it?

651
00:46:57,067 --> 00:47:00,320
- I'm a Baino Denny.
{y:i}- I wanted to go with him.

652
00:47:00,403 --> 00:47:02,906
Can I go to the farm
with you, brother?

653
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:05,075
Wa-da-tah!

654
00:47:05,158 --> 00:47:07,911
All right! Me and Pootie
going to the farm!

655
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:11,164
I'm lookin' forward
to this farm life.

656
00:47:11,247 --> 00:47:13,166
Enough of the city for me.

657
00:47:14,751 --> 00:47:18,505
Yeah, this is just
what we need, Pootie.

658
00:47:18,588 --> 00:47:22,884
Live off the fat
of the land, work hard.

659
00:47:22,926 --> 00:47:26,221
Farming, farming, farming.
I can't wait, man.

660
00:47:26,262 --> 00:47:28,223
I cannot wait.

661
00:47:28,264 --> 00:47:31,434
We're gonna milk that cow.

662
00:47:31,518 --> 00:47:33,436
Get all that milk.

663
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,689
Two percent, fat free.

664
00:47:35,772 --> 00:47:40,026
Skim milk. All that, man.
Chocolate milk.

665
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:43,947
I don't need
no television, cappuccino...

666
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:46,199
partying all night long.

667
00:47:46,282 --> 00:47:50,328
I'm want some blisters on my hands,
some sweat on my back.

668
00:47:50,412 --> 00:47:51,579
That's what I want.

669
00:47:57,711 --> 00:47:59,587
Shit!

670
00:47:59,629 --> 00:48:03,591
Oh, man. My pants.
Oh, man! My damn pants.

671
00:48:03,633 --> 00:48:06,511
All right.
Farming, farming, farming.

672
00:48:19,082 --> 00:48:22,002
This is not the thing, man.
This ain't cool, man.

673
00:48:22,044 --> 00:48:25,047
Dirty shoes, dirty pants...

674
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:27,841
dirty shirt, musty, stinky.

675
00:48:27,883 --> 00:48:29,885
It's hotter than
a camel's hump out here, man.

676
00:48:29,968 --> 00:48:32,387
And mosquitos all over my shirt.
I can't do it, man.

677
00:48:32,429 --> 00:48:34,890
Whose dog is this dog
following me around?

678
00:48:34,932 --> 00:48:37,059
Whose dog is that?
You don't know who dog that is.

679
00:48:37,142 --> 00:48:39,686
That could be anybody's dog.
It's too hot.

680
00:48:39,728 --> 00:48:41,688
You know you're hot.

681
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:02,835
{Y:i}I didn't wanna leave Pootie...

682
00:49:02,918 --> 00:49:05,087
{Y:i}but I wasn't trying to hear
all that survival shit.

683
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:08,549
{Y:i}Outback, my ass.
I need conveniences, man.

684
00:49:09,216 --> 00:49:12,052
{Y:i}On the other hand, Pootie was
lovin' every minute of it.

685
00:49:12,094 --> 00:49:15,764
{Y:i}He was rejuvenated.
You hear that? Rejuvenated.

686
00:49:15,848 --> 00:49:17,891
{Y:i}He was "juvenated" before,
lost it...

687
00:49:17,975 --> 00:49:20,394
{Y:i}and got "juvenated" again.

688
00:49:20,435 --> 00:49:21,311
{Y:i}Rejuvenated.

689
00:49:34,032 --> 00:49:37,870
{Y:i}And when Pootie planted
his first cornstalk...

690
00:49:37,953 --> 00:49:39,872
{Y:i}he was happy.

691
00:49:39,955 --> 00:49:43,667
{Y:i}Too damn happy, if you ask me.
It was just corn.

692
00:49:48,964 --> 00:49:52,593
{Y:i}But that was just what he needed
to take his mind off his troubles.

693
00:49:52,634 --> 00:49:55,762
Rown on the crowny town.

694
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,142
Mornin'.

695
00:50:04,188 --> 00:50:06,565
- Hi, Daddy.
- Not now, Stacy, honey.

696
00:50:06,648 --> 00:50:09,943
There's a new fella here in town.
He's coming in here in a minute.

697
00:50:10,944 --> 00:50:11,862
So?

698
00:50:11,945 --> 00:50:15,449
So? So maybe you can
marry him, that's what so.

699
00:50:15,532 --> 00:50:17,492
Aw, Daddy!

700
00:50:17,534 --> 00:50:21,788
Oh, come on.
Cut that shit out, Stacy.

701
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:24,583
Here he comes.

702
00:50:24,666 --> 00:50:26,585
Yeah. Hey there.

703
00:50:26,668 --> 00:50:29,296
You got your can
filled all right?

704
00:50:32,549 --> 00:50:34,051
This here is my daughter.

705
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,053
Stacy.

706
00:50:42,226 --> 00:50:45,646
Dillie on...

707
00:50:45,687 --> 00:50:47,147
my damie.

708
00:50:53,237 --> 00:50:56,323
And she's a looker,
ain't she? Huh?

709
00:51:13,924 --> 00:51:15,509
God, you stink.

710
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,053
Thank you.

711
00:51:18,136 --> 00:51:20,556
I wanna talk to you
about Pootie Tang.

712
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:23,559
You mean Public Enemy Number One
in my world.

713
00:51:26,854 --> 00:51:28,814
Right?

714
00:51:28,897 --> 00:51:30,899
We learned that anything
can be addictive.

715
00:51:31,733 --> 00:51:35,654
We took our burgers
and pumped them so full of MSG...

716
00:51:35,737 --> 00:51:39,700
that people can't even
taste real food anymore.

717
00:51:39,783 --> 00:51:43,495
Today American kids don't eat
'cause they're hungry.

718
00:51:43,579 --> 00:51:47,958
They eat 'cause they just gotta
have another Lecter burger.

719
00:51:49,585 --> 00:51:51,545
You see,
I own Pootie's name.

720
00:51:51,587 --> 00:51:55,299
He's mine. I don't need him
to sell my products anymore...

721
00:51:56,175 --> 00:51:58,594
because I've got thousands of them
all over the country.

722
00:51:58,635 --> 00:52:03,015
I'm just gonna give them
the clothes and this training tape.

723
00:52:04,433 --> 00:52:07,227
{Y:i}And remember, when making
a public appearance...

724
00:52:07,311 --> 00:52:10,898
{Y:i}Pootie Tang always
struts like this.

725
00:52:15,444 --> 00:52:20,240
Next week we're opening a brand-new
nationwide chain of burger stands.

726
00:52:24,161 --> 00:52:27,289
Pootie's Bad Time Burgers.

727
00:52:27,372 --> 00:52:29,833
In fact, the only thing that
could mess up our little party...

728
00:52:29,917 --> 00:52:33,253
is if the real Pootie
showed up.

729
00:52:33,337 --> 00:52:35,297
But that ain't good enough.

730
00:52:37,299 --> 00:52:39,468
- I want him dead.
- Yeah.

731
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:44,139
I'd like to put that bitch in the
ground myself, but I ain't magical.

732
00:52:44,223 --> 00:52:46,016
I been tryin' to get
that Pootie for years.

733
00:52:46,099 --> 00:52:49,978
He done jailed or offed all my boys.
All I got left is Froggy.

734
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:52,981
Nobody know
where Pootie's at.

735
00:52:53,023 --> 00:52:55,734
I know where he's at.

736
00:52:55,817 --> 00:52:57,736
I got people
everywhere, baby.

737
00:52:57,819 --> 00:53:01,281
Nobody can hide
from corporate America.

738
00:53:01,365 --> 00:53:03,825
And as far
as how to beat him...

739
00:53:06,036 --> 00:53:08,830
maybe this will help.

740
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:13,794
{Y:i}Hello.

741
00:53:15,045 --> 00:53:17,464
- Hello.
{y:i}- Uh-oh. Look at this.

742
00:53:17,506 --> 00:53:20,259
{Y:i}Remember her? That's Stacy,
the sheriff's daughter.

743
00:53:20,342 --> 00:53:23,512
{Y:i}He's been trying to get her ass
married since she was 12 years old.

744
00:53:23,595 --> 00:53:26,515
Hello? Is anybody here?

745
00:53:34,022 --> 00:53:37,526
Why--
I'm sorry, l--

746
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:42,990
Well, I made you a pie...

747
00:53:43,031 --> 00:53:44,825
cake.

748
00:53:49,371 --> 00:53:52,124
Do you want the pie?

749
00:53:57,171 --> 00:54:01,425
I know I'm not pretty or...

750
00:54:04,803 --> 00:54:06,388
or sexy.

751
00:54:08,557 --> 00:54:10,350
You probably like a--

752
00:54:11,685 --> 00:54:13,604
a sexy girl, right?

753
00:54:30,412 --> 00:54:32,873
Baby...

754
00:54:32,915 --> 00:54:36,627
I'm gonna sine your pity
on the runny Kine.

755
00:54:49,264 --> 00:54:53,560
Now, see, that's what makes
Pootie Tang a real hero.

756
00:54:53,602 --> 00:54:56,188
He can't stand by and see a woman
not lovin' herself.

757
00:54:56,271 --> 00:54:58,398
He's gonna put the love in her.

758
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,902
Now, me, I say just give her
a compliment.

759
00:55:01,985 --> 00:55:04,988
Hey, I like your shoes.
Have you been working out?

760
00:55:05,072 --> 00:55:07,699
Girl, what you doin'
with your hair?

761
00:55:07,783 --> 00:55:10,619
But I tell you what...

762
00:55:10,702 --> 00:55:14,373
I'm only gonna buy this hero shit
but so many times.

763
00:55:14,456 --> 00:55:16,208
{Y:i}Meanwhile...

764
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:19,586
{Y:i}back in the big city, all hell
was breaking loose, y'all.

765
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:22,256
{Y:i}I'm talking about
drug dealin', drug usin'...

766
00:55:22,339 --> 00:55:24,007
{Y:i}booty shakin '...

767
00:55:24,091 --> 00:55:25,259
{Y:i}too much damn TV...

768
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:29,012
{Y:i}drinkin', people eating too much,
gettin' all fat and sloppy...

769
00:55:29,096 --> 00:55:32,808
{Y:i}fightin', kids out of school,
ain't nobody readin'...

770
00:55:32,891 --> 00:55:34,977
{Y:i}people actin '
a straight damn fool.

771
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,062
{Y:i}And corporate America
was just lovin' it.

772
00:55:37,145 --> 00:55:39,439
{Y:i}Look at 'em.
It's a party now.

773
00:55:39,523 --> 00:55:43,151
{Y:i}Since he left, it just changed.
Everything just went bonkers, man.

774
00:55:43,235 --> 00:55:45,737
{Y:i}Everybody lost their mind
and whatnot.

775
00:55:45,821 --> 00:55:47,906
{Y:i}Pootie Tang,
you shouldn't do this.

776
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:50,117
{Y:i}You should come back to the city,
where you belong.

777
00:55:55,581 --> 00:55:57,791
{Y:i}Back on the farm,
the worst happened.

778
00:55:57,833 --> 00:56:00,335
{Y:i}Pootie Tang's cornstalk died.

779
00:56:00,377 --> 00:56:02,462
{Y:i}And for the third time
in his life...

780
00:56:02,504 --> 00:56:05,716
{Y:i}Pootie lost the only thing
that was important to him.

781
00:56:05,799 --> 00:56:10,637
{Y:i}First his family, then his belt,
and now his corn died.

782
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:13,265
{Y:i}Farm life was driving Pootie crazy.

783
00:56:13,348 --> 00:56:15,601
{Y:i}He must have lost his damn mind.
Look at him.

784
00:56:15,684 --> 00:56:19,104
{Y:i}Down on his knees,
crying over a piece of corn.

785
00:56:19,188 --> 00:56:22,566
{Y:i}Not even popcorn.
Regular damn corn.

786
00:56:22,649 --> 00:56:24,651
{Y:i}Pootie Tang had lost all hope...

787
00:56:24,735 --> 00:56:27,362
{Y:i}and it was gonna take a miracle
to bring him back.

788
00:56:44,755 --> 00:56:46,798
Up here, Pootie.

789
00:57:04,441 --> 00:57:06,485
Hey, watch the leaves.

790
00:57:10,197 --> 00:57:13,200
- Daddy?
- You damn right I'm your daddy.

791
00:57:13,283 --> 00:57:16,370
Pootie, what you doin'
runnin' away from your problems?

792
00:57:16,453 --> 00:57:17,913
Did I teach you like that?

793
00:57:19,373 --> 00:57:20,582
Hey, don't you mumble, boy!

794
00:57:20,666 --> 00:57:23,252
Pootie, my boy.

795
00:57:23,335 --> 00:57:24,586
Mama Di.

796
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:28,841
Pootie, you're a good man.
I'm proud of you.

797
00:57:28,924 --> 00:57:33,595
You have so much love in you,
and you can give it like a gift.

798
00:57:34,304 --> 00:57:37,766
Your father was wrong to tell you
to guard it like a secret.

799
00:57:37,808 --> 00:57:41,270
- What was that?
- Shut your mouth!

800
00:57:41,311 --> 00:57:44,022
- Woman!
- You corn-ass fool!

801
00:57:48,151 --> 00:57:50,237
Teach the world
right from wrong...

802
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:53,907
but love the world
at the same time.

803
00:57:53,949 --> 00:57:55,492
That's the key.

804
00:57:55,576 --> 00:57:59,288
Where's your belt, boy?
You let some girl get your belt.

805
00:57:59,371 --> 00:58:03,375
You let the ladies get your belt.
I knew that would happen.

806
00:58:03,458 --> 00:58:05,794
Now you done lost
all your confidence.

807
00:58:05,878 --> 00:58:09,256
I'll tell you something, ain't
nothing special about that belt.

808
00:58:09,298 --> 00:58:11,884
I bought it at Piggly Wiggly
for 95 cents.

809
00:58:11,967 --> 00:58:16,388
You don't need that belt 'cause
you got goodness in your heart.

810
00:58:16,471 --> 00:58:19,600
Now you need to go out there
and take that and kick some ass.

811
00:58:21,852 --> 00:58:23,145
Hey, don't you mumble, boy!

812
00:58:23,228 --> 00:58:25,147
Now, go out there,
take that goodness...

813
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:27,482
and teach the world
right from wrong.

814
00:58:27,566 --> 00:58:28,859
Now git!

815
00:58:53,008 --> 00:58:54,510
I, uh--

816
00:58:55,802 --> 00:58:59,556
I think maybe you and me
got something to talk about, huh?

817
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,600
I, uh--

820
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,742
Had yourself
a little time there?

821
00:59:23,622 --> 00:59:24,790
Yeah.

822
00:59:29,086 --> 00:59:30,420
That's terrific!

823
00:59:31,547 --> 00:59:35,133
Well, partner,

824
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:43,100
Like I say...

825
00:59:43,183 --> 00:59:47,437
I sure would be mighty proud
to have you for a son-in-law.

826
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:05,497
What the hell?

827
01:00:28,854 --> 01:00:30,856

01:01:19,752 --> 01:01:22,547
{Y:i}Ooh, he shouldn't

{Y:i}Come on, Pootie!

843
01:01:28,803 --> 01:01:31,222

Oh, you not so bad now,

847
01:02:57,350 --> 01:03:01,938
Guess you, um,

848
01:03:04,148 --> 01:03:05,775
Yeah.

849
01:03:05,858 --> 01:03:07,693
Now...

850
01:03:09,654 --> 01:03:11,405
Like I was sayin'--

851
01:03:28,172 --> 01:03:30,424
{Y:i}I was searching for Pootie
high and low...

852
01:03:30,508 --> 01:03:33,052
{Y:i}then I finally remembered
he was at the farm.

853
01:03:33,136 --> 01:03:35,138
{Y:i}All this time I had been
talking about the farm.

854
01:03:35,221 --> 01:03:38,558
{Y:i}How the hell did I forget
he was at the damn farm?

855
01:03:38,641 --> 01:03:41,602
{Y:i}Anyway, I got there
just in the nick of time.

856
01:03:41,686 --> 01:03:45,606
Oh, Pootie, you got to
come back to the city right now.

857
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:49,068
- What's the dabble, di?
- There's a wedding going on here.

858
01:03:49,152 --> 01:03:51,571
Man, they are using
your face, man.

859
01:03:51,654 --> 01:03:54,824
They're making you sell products
even when you're not there.

860
01:03:54,866 --> 01:03:56,701
I'm talking about cigarettes, man.

861
01:03:56,784 --> 01:04:00,538
And look. Malt liquor?
Pootie Tang malt liquor?

862
01:04:00,621 --> 01:04:02,707
They got all these Pootie-alikes.

863
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:04,834
You know what I'm saying?
Hawkin' all this shit.

864
01:04:04,917 --> 01:04:07,003
And everybody thinks
it's you, man, really.

865
01:04:07,086 --> 01:04:10,673
Come back to the city and let
everybody know the truth, man.

866
01:04:10,715 --> 01:04:12,216
Come on!

867
01:04:23,561 --> 01:04:25,813
All right, Pootie Tang!

868
01:04:31,944 --> 01:04:35,490
I ain't the marrying type.
I don't make my bed.

869
01:04:35,573 --> 01:04:38,326
I leave the toilet seat up
all the time. I'm a single--

870
01:04:39,535 --> 01:04:42,580
Oh, but she is
a lovely lady though.

871
01:04:52,715 --> 01:04:57,094
Pootie Tang and I are thrilled
to be opening this...

872
01:04:57,136 --> 01:05:02,183
the first Pootie Tang
Bad Time Burger restaurant.

873
01:05:02,266 --> 01:05:04,185
Right, Pootie?

874
01:05:04,268 --> 01:05:05,770

{Y:i}Sa da tay. Got that?

876
01:05:09,357 --> 01:05:13,277
Man, that ain't Pootie Tang.
That's Doodie Tang.

877
01:05:13,319 --> 01:05:15,279
You know,
that ain't Pootie Tang neither.

878
01:05:15,321 --> 01:05:17,281
I know it ain't Pootie Tang!

879
01:05:19,283 --> 01:05:21,536
I just said it ain't Pootie Tang!

880
01:05:21,619 --> 01:05:24,288
It's Doodie Tang!

881
01:05:24,372 --> 01:05:27,500
Sepatown, tipi tais.

882
01:05:27,583 --> 01:05:29,293
There you go.

883
01:05:33,714 --> 01:05:37,593
- Oh, Christ.
- Hey, that's Pootie Tang.

884
01:05:37,969 --> 01:05:39,762
Wa-da-tah.

885
01:05:39,846 --> 01:05:41,806
Don't pay attention to him.
That's nobody.

886
01:05:41,889 --> 01:05:44,350
This is Pootie Tang here.

887
01:05:44,434 --> 01:05:47,270
Yes. I'm Pootie.

888
01:05:47,311 --> 01:05:50,773
Now, clap it up, my hammies.

889
01:05:50,857 --> 01:05:54,610
{Y:i}Rinatine, my America.

01:05:54,652 --> 01:05:58,114
Coola may, my ca--

You think you've solved the problem?
Well, guess again.

892
01:06:13,337 --> 01:06:17,091
See, I got more Pooties
than you, Pootie.

893
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:28,853
You're not only late,
but you're outnumbered.

894
01:06:28,895 --> 01:06:31,731
And by this time tomorrow, there'll
be so many Pooties out there...

895
01:06:31,814 --> 01:06:33,983
you won't matter.

896
01:06:36,778 --> 01:06:41,115
He ain't alone, Mr. Rich Man.
I'm here too.

897
01:07:04,639 --> 01:07:05,681
Bitch!

898
01:07:21,697 --> 01:07:23,491
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

899
01:07:27,495 --> 01:07:29,539

Pootie Tang is back!

904

I got to say the nay-no,

905
01:08:55,416 --> 01:08:57,835
What will you do now, Pootie?

906
01:08:57,877 --> 01:09:00,505
We're gonna get married.

907
01:09:00,588 --> 01:09:01,964

908
01:09:03,007 --> 01:09:04,801
