1
00:00:08,979 --> 00:00:11,479
(light music)

2
00:00:25,635 --> 00:00:27,613
- [Bo] Hey, you wanna play a game with me?

3
00:00:27,613 --> 00:00:29,373
- [Cadon] Yeah, what kind of game?

4
00:00:29,373 --> 00:00:31,634
- [Bo] All right, what were gonna do

5
00:00:31,634 --> 00:00:33,698
is every time I see someone wearing black,

6
00:00:33,698 --> 00:00:35,021
I get to punch you.

7
00:00:35,021 --> 00:00:37,277
Every time you see someone wearing orange

8
00:00:37,277 --> 00:00:38,576
you get to punch me.

9
00:00:38,576 --> 00:00:42,238
- [Cadon] How come you
get to pick the colors?

10
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:43,595
- [Bo] 'Cause I made the game?

11
00:00:43,595 --> 00:00:45,238
- [Cadon] I don't think that's fair.

12
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:46,274
- Black!

13
00:00:46,274 --> 00:00:47,865
- [Cadon] I didn't see anybody.

14
00:00:47,865 --> 00:00:49,589
- You didn't have to see him, I saw him.

15
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:51,675
- Can I please pick a different color?

16
00:00:51,675 --> 00:00:52,925
- Nope, orange.

17
00:00:55,988 --> 00:00:58,312
- Hey, what girl you think I could keep?

18
00:00:58,312 --> 00:00:59,484
- Man, leave him alone.

19
00:00:59,484 --> 00:01:01,047
Why do you do that stupid hand thing?

20
00:01:01,047 --> 00:01:03,122
- I don't know, it was
just something my dad

21
00:01:03,122 --> 00:01:04,039
used to do.

22
00:01:05,388 --> 00:01:07,628
- Okay, boys, listen to me for a second.

23
00:01:07,628 --> 00:01:10,208
Cadon, today is very important to me

24
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:12,071
and I don't want you misbehaving.

25
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:13,911
Guys, please stop.

26
00:01:13,911 --> 00:01:17,489
Bo, Dylan, you know what
your parents expect of you.

27
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:19,180
Don't make me have to call them.

28
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,186
- Yes ma'am.

29
00:01:20,186 --> 00:01:23,591
- Our god is rich in mercy and grace.

30
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:26,871
He loves us with an everlasting love.

31
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:29,346
And his word gives us a small peek

32
00:01:29,346 --> 00:01:31,987
in the vastness of his love.

33
00:01:31,987 --> 00:01:33,468
- Scoot over, you.

34
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,469
Scoot over!

35
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,963
- He proves this.

36
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:38,325
Listen to what Scripture
says in Romans 5:8

37
00:01:38,325 --> 00:01:40,198
That God demonstrates his own love--

38
00:01:40,198 --> 00:01:41,952
- I'm hungry.
- Shh!

39
00:01:41,952 --> 00:01:44,635
- I was talking to you.

40
00:01:44,635 --> 00:01:45,872
I don't want this.

41
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:47,717
- Can they be any louder?

42
00:01:47,717 --> 00:01:49,899
- See God didn't just
say get your act together

43
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:51,072
and then come to me.

44
00:01:51,072 --> 00:01:52,353
- The game is still on.

45
00:01:52,353 --> 00:01:53,186
- No, I think I misheard you.

46
00:01:53,186 --> 00:01:55,182
- Orange!
- Stop.

47
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,015
- Shh.

48
00:01:57,102 --> 00:01:58,095
- Shh!

49
00:01:58,095 --> 00:02:01,716
- You see sin has left
us hopeless and helpless.

50
00:02:01,716 --> 00:02:04,836
So God sent Jesus to be our savior

51
00:02:04,836 --> 00:02:06,692
to die on the cross for us.

52
00:02:06,692 --> 00:02:08,815
To save us from our sins.
- I don't want this.

53
00:02:08,815 --> 00:02:11,215
- He's God's greatest gift to us.

54
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:12,255
- This is boring.

55
00:02:12,255 --> 00:02:14,139
- [Pastor] And maybe this
morning you feel broken.

56
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:15,097
- Feet stay on the ground.

57
00:02:15,097 --> 00:02:15,930
- [Bo] I'm comfortable.

58
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,292
- To be encouraged that God,
Jesus, is the great potter

59
00:02:19,292 --> 00:02:21,234
who can take the pieces of your life

60
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:24,268
to put them back together
and make you whole again.

61
00:02:24,268 --> 00:02:26,274
If you feel lost, you're
wandering through your life,

62
00:02:26,274 --> 00:02:29,941
Jesus is a great shepherd
who seeks you out.

63
00:02:31,356 --> 00:02:35,915
Maybe you feel lost and
you can't find your way.

64
00:02:35,915 --> 00:02:37,719
He's the light.
- This is not working.

65
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,000
Come on boys, we got to go, hurry.

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,003
- It's all your fault.

67
00:02:40,003 --> 00:02:41,670
- Life is specialty.

68
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,800
(tense music)

69
00:02:48,238 --> 00:02:50,386
- What just happened?

70
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:51,523
Why did we just get kicked out?

71
00:02:51,523 --> 00:02:52,439
- Bo, come on!

72
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,413
- No, why do we have to leave?

73
00:02:54,413 --> 00:02:56,050
- Come get in the car!

74
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:56,883
- No!

75
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,057
I thought God was supposed to be nice.

76
00:03:07,911 --> 00:03:10,411
(clanking)

77
00:03:10,411 --> 00:03:11,591
- [Woman On Radio] SN to all units

78
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,455
be in route to 13201 Farm Road 10.

79
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:17,575
Active shooter, possible
hostage situation.

80
00:03:17,575 --> 00:03:19,611
- Breaking news this
evening of a church shooting

81
00:03:19,611 --> 00:03:21,015
in Rangeview County.

82
00:03:21,015 --> 00:03:22,636
We have reporters on the scene.

83
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,759
- [Reporter] It's about
a block away right now

84
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:27,116
but we believe there may
even be an active shooter

85
00:03:27,116 --> 00:03:28,591
still in the building.

86
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:30,568
- We're on the scene of
a deadly church shooting

87
00:03:30,568 --> 00:03:33,074
about eight miles outside of Rangeview.

88
00:03:33,074 --> 00:03:36,971
- At what is being
called a church massacre.

89
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:39,794
- Now this church building is
located in a very remote area

90
00:03:39,794 --> 00:03:42,392
adding to a great deal of confusion.

91
00:03:42,392 --> 00:03:44,317
- We do know that crime
scene investigators

92
00:03:44,317 --> 00:03:47,369
are still inside collecting
evidence and forensics.

93
00:03:47,369 --> 00:03:49,699
- We've seen bodies actually being carried

94
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:51,656
from the building.

95
00:03:51,656 --> 00:03:52,775
- The Sheriff's department tells us

96
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:55,795
that they've recovered a
military style assault rifle

97
00:03:55,795 --> 00:03:56,628
from the scene.

98
00:03:56,628 --> 00:03:58,381
- We also know that
there are several people

99
00:03:58,381 --> 00:04:00,179
in custody at this point in time

100
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:01,981
but they have not released their names.

101
00:04:01,981 --> 00:04:04,098
A press conference with
Sheriff Jerry Winters

102
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:06,931
is expected sometime this evening.

103
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:09,728
- New details are emerging this afternoon

104
00:04:09,728 --> 00:04:13,311
about the events that
took place yesterday.

105
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:17,313
- While the motives remain uncertain,

106
00:04:17,313 --> 00:04:19,313
we did talk to one witness who was here

107
00:04:19,313 --> 00:04:21,056
at the church at the time of the shooting.

108
00:04:21,056 --> 00:04:25,749
She believes that a domestic
dispute may be involved.

109
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:27,508
- I'm just thankful it's over.

110
00:04:27,508 --> 00:04:29,112
- A place where people come to worship,

111
00:04:29,112 --> 00:04:32,227
where they come for healing,
comfort and to feel safe

112
00:04:32,227 --> 00:04:34,428
has now become a target.

113
00:04:34,428 --> 00:04:37,345
- We're shocked and really hurting.

114
00:04:38,793 --> 00:04:40,126
- We're still learning more information

115
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:41,449
from the Sheriff's department

116
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:44,146
concerning the deadly shooting
that happened here yesterday.

117
00:04:44,146 --> 00:04:46,283
- Even here a day later, police officials

118
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:49,607
have still not released the
identities of the victims.

119
00:04:49,607 --> 00:04:51,927
- They've started a
memorial in honor of those

120
00:04:51,927 --> 00:04:55,804
that they've lost, bringing
teddy bears, flowers and signs.

121
00:04:55,804 --> 00:04:57,036
- This is just a tragic event

122
00:04:57,036 --> 00:04:58,875
that has befallen this community.

123
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,572
The Sheriff's office has been in and out

124
00:05:00,572 --> 00:05:01,772
of the courthouse this morning.

125
00:05:01,772 --> 00:05:04,759
- While many questions
still remain unanswered,

126
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:07,457
the one question that's on everyone's mind

127
00:05:07,457 --> 00:05:10,707
is how does something like this happen?

128
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:22,010
- You gotta tell me man, what is all this?

129
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,594
- All this?

130
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:25,114
This is my family.

131
00:05:25,114 --> 00:05:26,932
- Family?
- Mhmm.

132
00:05:26,932 --> 00:05:30,410
- You went off and got
married and didn't tell me?

133
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,407
- No.

134
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:32,809
No, nothing like that.

135
00:05:32,809 --> 00:05:35,191
I met her a while back at a party

136
00:05:35,191 --> 00:05:38,254
and things have been going
really good ever since.

137
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,491
- Yeah, until you knocked her up.

138
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:41,891
- No, man I didn't knock her up.

139
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:44,355
She already had Austin.

140
00:05:44,355 --> 00:05:47,351
But man I love him like he was my own.

141
00:05:47,351 --> 00:05:48,531
- I don't know man, I mean

142
00:05:48,531 --> 00:05:49,955
that just seems like
a lot of baggage to me

143
00:05:49,955 --> 00:05:51,591
just for a chick.

144
00:05:51,591 --> 00:05:52,953
- And it would be if she was just a chick

145
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,131
but she's more than that.

146
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:56,030
She's real special.

147
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,647
- Yeah well, she's
special where it counts,

148
00:05:57,647 --> 00:05:59,887
I'll give you that much.

149
00:05:59,887 --> 00:06:02,665
What happened to this
whole engineer degree?

150
00:06:02,665 --> 00:06:03,685
I mean isn't that why you came out here

151
00:06:03,685 --> 00:06:04,518
in the first place?

152
00:06:04,518 --> 00:06:07,706
- Yeah I did, and I was going
to school for a little while.

153
00:06:07,706 --> 00:06:08,864
- Then she got in the way?

154
00:06:08,864 --> 00:06:10,464
- No, she didn't get in the way.

155
00:06:10,464 --> 00:06:13,203
Life just had something
else in store for me.

156
00:06:13,203 --> 00:06:14,244
I may not have the same kind of money

157
00:06:14,244 --> 00:06:16,266
that I'd have if I was an engineer, but,

158
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:17,264
- What do you mean, you're broke?

159
00:06:17,264 --> 00:06:18,368
- No, I'm not broke.

160
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:19,683
- No, come on man, level with me.

161
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:20,804
I mean you got a kid and a chick now

162
00:06:20,804 --> 00:06:22,805
so they're expensive.

163
00:06:22,805 --> 00:06:24,048
- No, we're good, really.

164
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:25,045
We're all right.

165
00:06:25,045 --> 00:06:28,469
We just kind of take it day to day.

166
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:29,302
Wait, no man, come on.

167
00:06:29,302 --> 00:06:31,819
- [Bo] Take it, man, come on.

168
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:32,982
Just take it.

169
00:06:32,982 --> 00:06:35,259
- All right, but I'm gonna pay you back.

170
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:38,481
- Don't even worry about it, man.

171
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,063
- Bo, you always been
like a brother to me.

172
00:06:40,063 --> 00:06:42,283
- [Bo] That's what I'm here for, man

173
00:06:42,283 --> 00:06:43,440
- [Cadon] Thanks man.

174
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,820
- I'm happy for you though.

175
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,090
I'm glad you found what
you were looking for.

176
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,423
It's good to meet you, Jess.

177
00:06:53,161 --> 00:06:54,180
- [Jess] Wanna play it again?

178
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,780
Did I get you?

179
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,025
- Hey, little man, what's happening?

180
00:06:58,025 --> 00:06:59,525
How are you doing?

181
00:07:00,361 --> 00:07:03,357
What did you think of your Uncle Bo?

182
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:04,441
- What is that?

183
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:06,495
- Huh, what did you think of him?

184
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,377
- He wants to play on the swing.

185
00:07:08,377 --> 00:07:10,233
I think he's addicted to the swings.

186
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:12,020
- [Cadon] So, what'd you think?

187
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,017
- About Bo?

188
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:14,031
- [Cadon] Yeah.

189
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:16,531
- Um, he didn't stay long, so,

190
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,836
I don't know, I thought he
was a little creepy actually.

191
00:07:20,836 --> 00:07:21,860
- Creepy?

192
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,996
- Yes, actually.
- Really?

193
00:07:22,996 --> 00:07:27,596
Well, creepy Uncle Bo just
gave us a hundred bucks.

194
00:07:27,596 --> 00:07:28,814
- Well.

195
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:30,313
Well he's not that creepy then.

196
00:07:30,313 --> 00:07:31,534
- [Cadon] Well I guess he ain't.

197
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,534
- How about that?
- Mhmm.

198
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,257
- [Alan] Sherry, thank
you so much for dinner.

199
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,291
This was delicious.

200
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,124
- You are so welcome.

201
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:40,532
- [James] Yeah honey it was great.

202
00:07:40,532 --> 00:07:42,307
- [Alan] James, you sure
do have a good deal here.

203
00:07:42,307 --> 00:07:43,309
- Thank you,

204
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:45,507
appreciate it.
- Great family, great family.

205
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,149
- Speaking of family,

206
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:48,806
I need to talk to you about Jess.

207
00:07:48,806 --> 00:07:49,949
- Yeah.

208
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:54,547
- She was here about six
months ago with Austin.

209
00:07:54,547 --> 00:07:56,589
Stormed out, mad.

210
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:59,427
Since then we haven't
seen or heard from her.

211
00:07:59,427 --> 00:08:00,728
We don't know what's going on.

212
00:08:00,728 --> 00:08:02,087
We don't know where she's living.

213
00:08:02,087 --> 00:08:03,945
We don't know anything.

214
00:08:03,945 --> 00:08:06,028
- I'm sorry to hear that.

215
00:08:07,248 --> 00:08:08,706
What are you thinking?

216
00:08:08,706 --> 00:08:11,388
- We're just worried sick.

217
00:08:11,388 --> 00:08:13,666
We just wanna know what's
going on with them.

218
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:14,664
- What's really bothering me

219
00:08:14,664 --> 00:08:16,332
is she's bouncing from house to house

220
00:08:16,332 --> 00:08:18,652
and that is no way for
a little boy to live.

221
00:08:18,652 --> 00:08:20,348
He needs routine.

222
00:08:20,348 --> 00:08:22,492
Matter of fact, the past
few times we've seen him

223
00:08:22,492 --> 00:08:24,316
he's been only in a diaper.

224
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:26,396
And nothing breaks my heart

225
00:08:26,396 --> 00:08:28,892
more than worrying about my grandson.

226
00:08:28,892 --> 00:08:31,116
- Well, is she still on probation?

227
00:08:31,116 --> 00:08:32,369
- I believe so.

228
00:08:32,369 --> 00:08:33,792
It's gonna be up in two years

229
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:36,135
which would have been about July, no.

230
00:08:36,135 --> 00:08:37,153
- August.

231
00:08:37,153 --> 00:08:39,452
- Is there any chance
that she'd be willing

232
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,313
to bring him and live here?

233
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,993
I mean this is a nice place.

234
00:08:42,993 --> 00:08:45,152
- Honestly, Alan, we have prayed

235
00:08:45,152 --> 00:08:47,490
for something like that for so long.

236
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,152
But I just don't see it happening.

237
00:08:51,152 --> 00:08:52,215
- So are you guys telling me

238
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:55,872
that you're wanting to file for custody?

239
00:08:55,872 --> 00:08:57,532
- We're willing to do whatever it takes.

240
00:08:57,532 --> 00:08:59,756
We just want to know that they're okay.

241
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:02,396
- Well, what you're asking for is possible

242
00:09:02,396 --> 00:09:04,732
but it's very difficult in the state.

243
00:09:04,732 --> 00:09:06,375
- Yeah but if we could get Austin here,

244
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,273
then Jess can get on her feet

245
00:09:08,273 --> 00:09:10,773
and we'll be able to help her.

246
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,516
- You two are really good friends.

247
00:09:13,516 --> 00:09:15,330
I've known you a long time.

248
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,055
And I've seen cases like this in the past

249
00:09:18,055 --> 00:09:21,116
and I need to tell you
that if we go this route

250
00:09:21,116 --> 00:09:24,699
you have to prepare
for things to get ugly.

251
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:43,505
- Okay last time.

252
00:09:43,505 --> 00:09:45,740
Just one more time, okay?

253
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,647
- Jess, you said that the last time.

254
00:09:48,647 --> 00:09:51,367
Where's that money that Bo gave us anyway?

255
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:53,265
- Austin needs stuff.

256
00:09:53,265 --> 00:09:56,583
Kids, they need more than you
think and money goes fast.

257
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,407
- Oh it goes fast all right.

258
00:09:58,407 --> 00:09:59,804
$60 pair of jeans?

259
00:09:59,804 --> 00:10:03,927
- Excuse me, you know they were
not $60 jeans first of all.

260
00:10:03,927 --> 00:10:06,007
And second of all, I'm
not gonna let my kid

261
00:10:06,007 --> 00:10:09,004
run around in garage
sale crap all the time.

262
00:10:09,004 --> 00:10:10,748
- Look, I'm not trying to start a fight.

263
00:10:10,748 --> 00:10:14,124
You just know how much I hate doing this.

264
00:10:14,124 --> 00:10:16,551
- I don't like it either.

265
00:10:16,551 --> 00:10:19,218
Let's just go, get it over with.

266
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,150
(tense music)

267
00:10:31,408 --> 00:10:32,412
- Where's your restroom?

268
00:10:32,412 --> 00:10:33,995
He needs a changee.

269
00:10:43,148 --> 00:10:44,815
- [Cadon] Just this.

270
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,517
(beeping)

271
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:56,689
- [Cashier] Still not working.

272
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:57,522
Do you have another card?

273
00:10:57,522 --> 00:10:58,355
- Yeah.

274
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,792
(beeping)

275
00:11:14,061 --> 00:11:15,327
- Thank you.

276
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,361
- Hey, I just got gas.

277
00:11:16,361 --> 00:11:17,844
Can I just go ahead and pay?

278
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:18,847
- I'm sorry.

279
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:20,047
It's probably their machine.

280
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,841
This'll just take a second.

281
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:22,904
Try that one.

282
00:11:22,904 --> 00:11:23,737
- No cash?

283
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:31,048
- I don't think that's
gonna help very much.

284
00:11:31,048 --> 00:11:33,672
You know what, don't worry about it.

285
00:11:33,672 --> 00:11:35,005
I appreciate it.

286
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:38,866
Have a good night, okay, thank you.

287
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:44,970
Never again.

288
00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:47,186
- I know, I know.

289
00:11:47,186 --> 00:11:48,353
Let's just go.

290
00:11:50,098 --> 00:11:52,598
(light music)

291
00:12:43,577 --> 00:12:45,577
- All right, well that
takes care of everything.

292
00:12:45,577 --> 00:12:48,612
If I can just get you to
sign here on the service call

293
00:12:48,612 --> 00:12:50,373
I can get out of your way.

294
00:12:50,373 --> 00:12:51,577
- I'm not signing anything.

295
00:12:51,577 --> 00:12:53,657
You didn't fix anything.

296
00:12:53,657 --> 00:12:56,035
- Well I did everything
that was on the list.

297
00:12:56,035 --> 00:12:57,049
- I don't care about your list.

298
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:58,053
You can shove your list.

299
00:12:58,053 --> 00:12:59,731
I want this TV working.

300
00:12:59,731 --> 00:13:01,054
Now!

301
00:13:01,054 --> 00:13:02,931
- With all due respect,
I've done everything

302
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:04,953
that's on this invoice that the company

303
00:13:04,953 --> 00:13:06,308
wrote down for me to do.

304
00:13:06,308 --> 00:13:08,308
- I don't care.

305
00:13:08,308 --> 00:13:10,850
I don't have a system that works.

306
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,110
I ask you to come out and fix
it and you didn't do anything.

307
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,174
You changed a couple connectors.

308
00:13:16,174 --> 00:13:18,590
- If you don't sign this
list, I can't get paid.

309
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,854
- No, I'm not signing anything.

310
00:13:19,854 --> 00:13:21,854
It's not my problem.

311
00:13:21,854 --> 00:13:23,854
Your problem is to fix this system

312
00:13:23,854 --> 00:13:25,604
and it's not working.

313
00:13:30,468 --> 00:13:33,135
(phone ringing)

314
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:38,106
- Hello?

315
00:13:38,106 --> 00:13:39,891
- [Jess] Hey, Jenn, it's Jess.

316
00:13:39,891 --> 00:13:41,809
- Oh my gosh, Jess, how are you?

317
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:42,990
Where have you been?

318
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,212
How's Austin?

319
00:13:44,212 --> 00:13:45,970
- We're fine, he's fine.

320
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,188
But listen, I need to ask a favor.

321
00:13:49,188 --> 00:13:51,150
- [Jenn] Yeah, what's up?

322
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,330
- We kind of hit a rough
spot this last month

323
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,412
and I was hoping maybe you
could send us some money,

324
00:13:55,412 --> 00:13:56,974
you know to get us by?

325
00:13:56,974 --> 00:13:59,210
- Yeah for sure, let
me go ask mom and dad.

326
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,892
- [Jess] No, no don't
say anything to them.

327
00:14:01,892 --> 00:14:03,732
I don't want them to worry.

328
00:14:03,732 --> 00:14:06,472
- Okay, what do you want me to do?

329
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:08,612
- I was hoping you could mail me,

330
00:14:08,612 --> 00:14:09,992
you know, like 300 dollars.

331
00:14:09,992 --> 00:14:12,742
- Jess, I don't have 300 dollars.

332
00:14:13,774 --> 00:14:16,312
- Couldn't you just make up
something to mom and dad,

333
00:14:16,312 --> 00:14:18,014
you know, to get it out
of them or something?

334
00:14:18,014 --> 00:14:19,614
- Well I'm not gonna lie to them

335
00:14:19,614 --> 00:14:22,872
but I think I can still get it.

336
00:14:22,872 --> 00:14:24,772
This money's for you and Austin, right?

337
00:14:24,772 --> 00:14:26,872
- Yeah, yes yes of course.

338
00:14:26,872 --> 00:14:28,772
Here, I'll give you the address.

339
00:14:28,772 --> 00:14:31,105
- Um yeah, let me get a pen.

340
00:14:49,412 --> 00:14:51,912
(metal music)

341
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:59,429
- Hey, put your stuff in the back.

342
00:15:03,263 --> 00:15:04,096
Damn dude, look at you.

343
00:15:04,096 --> 00:15:06,447
You need to get a haircut, bro.

344
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,363
- Yeah I know.

345
00:15:08,363 --> 00:15:09,876
- [Bo] So how's everything in there?

346
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:11,019
- Everything's fine.

347
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:12,356
Dad stopped drinking anyways.

348
00:15:12,356 --> 00:15:14,219
- (scoffs) Yeah dude.

349
00:15:14,219 --> 00:15:15,579
You know how many times I've heard that

350
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:16,918
every single day of my life,

351
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:18,939
dad's stopped drinking.

352
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:21,136
He ain't ever gonna
change, man, he's a liar.

353
00:15:21,136 --> 00:15:22,998
- Yeah well things have
seriously changed now.

354
00:15:22,998 --> 00:15:24,331
- Whatever, man.

355
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:27,019
Look, anytime that you
need a place to stay

356
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:28,321
you know where to come.

357
00:15:28,321 --> 00:15:30,379
- But I thought Cadon was living with you.

358
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:31,659
- No.

359
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:34,838
He's all chasing some piece of tail.

360
00:15:34,838 --> 00:15:37,078
What about you, you got a girl yet?

361
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:37,911
- No.

362
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:39,671
- Good.

363
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,363
(somber music)

364
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:05,164
- [Jess] Morning.

365
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,737
- Hey, good morning.

366
00:16:06,737 --> 00:16:07,736
- [Jess] How are you?

367
00:16:07,736 --> 00:16:08,699
- [Cadon] Good, how'd you sleep?

368
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:09,564
- Okay.

369
00:16:09,564 --> 00:16:11,341
- Little boy.

370
00:16:11,341 --> 00:16:12,898
Tired little boy.

371
00:16:12,898 --> 00:16:13,745
- You hungry?

372
00:16:13,745 --> 00:16:14,578
- Mhmm.

373
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:15,411
- Okay.

374
00:16:24,961 --> 00:16:27,794
(water splashing)

375
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:35,167
Are you playing?

376
00:16:38,592 --> 00:16:42,432
I don't think water's gonna
help that piece of junk, hon.

377
00:16:42,432 --> 00:16:43,265
- Huh?

378
00:16:46,495 --> 00:16:47,498
(gasping)

379
00:16:47,498 --> 00:16:49,374
- Oh he's getting us, ah!

380
00:16:49,374 --> 00:16:50,469
Stop, stop.

381
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:52,969
(light music)

382
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,112
Let's get him, ah, let's get him,

383
00:16:55,112 --> 00:16:56,166
come on come on!

384
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,766
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

385
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:58,726
- You stay, hey hey hey,

386
00:16:58,726 --> 00:16:59,559
you stay over there.

387
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:00,571
- We're gonna go get him.

388
00:17:00,571 --> 00:17:02,071
Should we get him?

389
00:17:04,326 --> 00:17:05,659
- Are they gone?

390
00:17:06,545 --> 00:17:08,566
Is anybody out there?

391
00:17:08,566 --> 00:17:10,289
I think they ran away.

392
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:12,043
Hmm, I don't see anybody.

393
00:17:12,043 --> 00:17:13,745
I think I'm good.

394
00:17:13,745 --> 00:17:14,662
Ooh, oh oh!

395
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:20,486
I surrender, I surrender! (laughing)

396
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:21,319
Oh man.

397
00:17:22,225 --> 00:17:23,225
Oh goodness.

398
00:17:26,641 --> 00:17:27,474
Oh man.

399
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,760
- [Jess] You picked the
wrong fight, mister.

400
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,761
- I know that's right.

401
00:17:30,761 --> 00:17:32,502
I was just no match for the two of you.

402
00:17:32,502 --> 00:17:34,419
- Obviously, obviously.

403
00:17:35,462 --> 00:17:37,222
(laughs)

404
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:40,065
- You know Jess, I think about how

405
00:17:40,065 --> 00:17:42,565
this car really is all beat up

406
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,505
and I know you deserve
better, you and Austin.

407
00:17:45,505 --> 00:17:47,861
I just wish, sometimes I wish
I could get you a new one.

408
00:17:47,861 --> 00:17:50,406
- You're being silly.

409
00:17:50,406 --> 00:17:52,283
We don't need that.

410
00:17:52,283 --> 00:17:55,766
You have given more to
us than anybody else has.

411
00:17:55,766 --> 00:17:57,387
I mean you're letting us live here.

412
00:17:57,387 --> 00:18:01,243
You're gonna watch Austin
while I'm trying to work, and,

413
00:18:01,243 --> 00:18:04,086
you mean more to us than anybody.

414
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:06,841
And we don't need a new car.

415
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:08,281
We need you.

416
00:18:08,281 --> 00:18:10,486
- I don't know about all that.

417
00:18:10,486 --> 00:18:12,582
But even if half of what
you're saying is true

418
00:18:12,582 --> 00:18:13,862
it doesn't even start to compare

419
00:18:13,862 --> 00:18:16,022
to how much you and Austin mean to me.

420
00:18:16,022 --> 00:18:18,522
You guys are everything to me.

421
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,602
- You know life will get better.

422
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,166
- Mhmm.

423
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:27,142
- I mean I don't need
money to make me happy.

424
00:18:27,142 --> 00:18:28,157
We don't need money, right?

425
00:18:28,157 --> 00:18:28,990
- No.

426
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,309
- And money doesn't make me a better mom.

427
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:34,381
And that's all that
matters to me right now.

428
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:36,682
Austin is everything.

429
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:38,464
- You are an awesome mom.

430
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:40,000
Anybody who's been around
you for five minutes--

431
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,999
- You're just saying that.

432
00:18:40,999 --> 00:18:42,160
- No, it's how awesome you are.

433
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,205
They know how much you love him.

434
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,522
- You're being too nice.

435
00:18:44,522 --> 00:18:45,355
You're nice all the time.

436
00:18:45,355 --> 00:18:47,901
- Well you make it easy, mhmm.

437
00:18:47,901 --> 00:18:48,818
Yes you do.

438
00:18:50,724 --> 00:18:51,924
- 'Cause everybody else seems to focus

439
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:54,424
on all the mistakes I've made.

440
00:18:55,262 --> 00:18:56,278
- I think you're the only one

441
00:18:56,278 --> 00:18:58,062
who focuses on that stuff.

442
00:18:58,062 --> 00:18:59,359
- Okay.

443
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,192
- That's what I think.

444
00:19:00,192 --> 00:19:01,396
- You're trying to start another fight

445
00:19:01,396 --> 00:19:02,398
is what you're doing.

446
00:19:02,398 --> 00:19:03,422
- Maybe.
- I'll get the hose.

447
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:04,558
Austin's ready.
- What?

448
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:05,391
What?
- We'll take you on.

449
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:06,644
- Girl I'm the hose master.
- Not kidding, are you?

450
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:09,822
Are you?
- You better get two hoses.

451
00:19:09,822 --> 00:19:11,336
- We can't afford two hoses.

452
00:19:11,336 --> 00:19:12,169
- Ooh man!

453
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:15,118
Aw, she hit me with the low blow.

454
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:18,285
Ref, we got a flag on the field, flag.

455
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:22,427
- Look.

456
00:19:23,678 --> 00:19:28,180
We had a lot of applicants
more qualified than you.

457
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,138
And man, there are a lot of people here,

458
00:19:30,138 --> 00:19:33,556
they wouldn't be comfortable
with this arrangement.

459
00:19:33,556 --> 00:19:35,994
- I understand that.

460
00:19:35,994 --> 00:19:37,411
- But I know you.

461
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:42,994
And I feel like this is
something that I need to do.

462
00:19:42,994 --> 00:19:43,934
So there you go.

463
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:44,911
- Thank you.
- All right.

464
00:19:44,911 --> 00:19:45,871
- Thank you very much.

465
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:48,132
Really appreciate it, next week right?

466
00:19:48,132 --> 00:19:48,965
- Next week.

467
00:19:48,965 --> 00:19:49,798
- I love it.

468
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:50,631
Thanks a lot, man.

469
00:19:50,631 --> 00:19:51,464
Passion.

470
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,667
- You know James, today was ridiculous.

471
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:06,669
- What?

472
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:08,051
I thought it was a great game.

473
00:20:08,051 --> 00:20:09,304
- It was a great game.

474
00:20:09,304 --> 00:20:10,931
I'm talking about that pasture

475
00:20:10,931 --> 00:20:12,691
that we had to play on today.

476
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:15,384
We pay top dollar for our
kids to have a good field

477
00:20:15,384 --> 00:20:17,411
and they play on that thing?

478
00:20:17,411 --> 00:20:18,509
- Honey, it really wasn't that bad.

479
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,029
- It wasn't that bad?

480
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:21,747
Were you at the same game I was at?

481
00:20:21,747 --> 00:20:23,251
Our daughter's way too good

482
00:20:23,251 --> 00:20:25,687
to play on a team in a field like that.

483
00:20:25,687 --> 00:20:27,107
- You know, to be honest,

484
00:20:27,107 --> 00:20:28,787
I am so tired of Emily.

485
00:20:28,787 --> 00:20:31,629
It's like she's such a ball hog.

486
00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:33,747
I don't even know how
she's still on this team.

487
00:20:33,747 --> 00:20:36,167
- Well I think we all played well.

488
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:37,811
- We?

489
00:20:37,811 --> 00:20:39,469
No offense, Jenn but

490
00:20:39,469 --> 00:20:41,207
don't you have to play
every once in a while

491
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:44,407
to be considered part of the team?

492
00:20:44,407 --> 00:20:46,327
- If we have a game like that next week,

493
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:47,427
I'm gonna pull her out.

494
00:20:47,427 --> 00:20:48,429
She's not gonna play.

495
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:49,735
We'll see how the coach likes that one.

496
00:20:49,735 --> 00:20:50,568
- Jerry!

497
00:20:52,035 --> 00:20:54,040
- What's up, boys?

498
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,694
What's going on, Karl?

499
00:20:55,694 --> 00:20:56,694
- How are you, Jerry?

500
00:20:56,694 --> 00:20:57,715
- [Jerry] Good, James.

501
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:58,548
- [James] What's going on?

502
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:59,381
- Not much.

503
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:00,913
Ladies, kids.

504
00:21:00,913 --> 00:21:02,174
Oh, soccer game today?

505
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:03,176
- Yeah.

506
00:21:03,176 --> 00:21:04,174
They did great.

507
00:21:04,174 --> 00:21:05,176
- Shawna scored three goals.

508
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:06,675
Best player on the team.

509
00:21:06,675 --> 00:21:08,254
- Oh, Shawna.

510
00:21:08,254 --> 00:21:09,592
Well hey, good seeing y'all.

511
00:21:09,592 --> 00:21:10,425
Enjoy your day.
- See you.

512
00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:12,508
- You too.
- Bye, Sheriff.

513
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,467
(clanking)

514
00:21:18,467 --> 00:21:19,300
- Dang it!

515
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,668
(sighs)

516
00:21:21,668 --> 00:21:23,310
- Hey, how's it going?

517
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,774
- [Cadon] Oh, it's been better.

518
00:21:25,774 --> 00:21:26,910
- Yeah?

519
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,118
- You don't happen to be a mechanic,

520
00:21:28,118 --> 00:21:30,092
are you?
- Can't say I am, sorry.

521
00:21:30,092 --> 00:21:32,327
You're out of luck.

522
00:21:32,327 --> 00:21:35,488
Hey, I just put Austin to bed

523
00:21:35,488 --> 00:21:37,452
and I was wondering if
you wanted to come inside

524
00:21:37,452 --> 00:21:39,452
for a few minutes?

525
00:21:39,452 --> 00:21:41,408
What do you think?

526
00:21:41,408 --> 00:21:43,868
- I think there is nothing on this planet

527
00:21:43,868 --> 00:21:47,468
I would rather do than
come inside with you.

528
00:21:47,468 --> 00:21:50,172
But I have got to finish this car.

529
00:21:50,172 --> 00:21:51,788
If I don't get this done,

530
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:53,308
then I can't do the calls.

531
00:21:53,308 --> 00:21:55,948
And if I don't take my calls then I can't,

532
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:58,528
I can't pay the rent, I can't do anything.

533
00:21:58,528 --> 00:22:00,778
But let me get a raincheck.

534
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,792
- Okay. (laughs)

535
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:06,694
All right, well I'm gonna
be inside then, okay?

536
00:22:06,694 --> 00:22:07,777
Right in there.

537
00:22:07,777 --> 00:22:09,110
Okay, good luck.

538
00:22:10,092 --> 00:22:11,759
- I'm gonna need it!

539
00:22:22,093 --> 00:22:23,777
- [James] What are you doing?

540
00:22:23,777 --> 00:22:25,860
- Nothing, just piddling.

541
00:22:30,118 --> 00:22:33,974
Actually, I've been
writing letters to Austin.

542
00:22:33,974 --> 00:22:38,974
I'm hoping someday this
will all make sense to him.

543
00:22:38,977 --> 00:22:41,798
- You know Alan called me
yesterday at the office.

544
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:44,358
- You didn't tell me that.

545
00:22:44,358 --> 00:22:45,617
- There really wasn't much to say.

546
00:22:45,617 --> 00:22:49,613
He said he thought something
would be happening soon.

547
00:22:49,613 --> 00:22:50,954
- What does that mean?

548
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:51,958
- I don't know.

549
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:52,972
He was in a hurry to get to court

550
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:54,889
and that's all he said.

551
00:23:02,075 --> 00:23:05,057
- Hello Stashawn, this
is your dad calling.

552
00:23:05,057 --> 00:23:07,777
I just wanted to call to see

553
00:23:07,777 --> 00:23:09,094
what might have happened tonight

554
00:23:09,094 --> 00:23:11,046
and why you couldn't make it.

555
00:23:11,046 --> 00:23:12,474
It's okay that you didn't.

556
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,998
I understand things happen
and that's all right.

557
00:23:14,998 --> 00:23:17,756
And I just really want to talk to you

558
00:23:17,756 --> 00:23:19,735
and see you because there are some things

559
00:23:19,735 --> 00:23:21,573
that I can't say over the phone.

560
00:23:21,573 --> 00:23:24,193
And I just need to find out
what's going on with you

561
00:23:24,193 --> 00:23:28,577
and let you know what's
happening with me in my life.

562
00:23:28,577 --> 00:23:31,793
Be blessed, tell mom and
Kiera that I said hello

563
00:23:31,793 --> 00:23:33,452
and I love them, I love you

564
00:23:33,452 --> 00:23:35,249
and I hope to talk to you soon.

565
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:38,166
Love you again, take care, bye bye.

566
00:23:45,607 --> 00:23:48,567
- So you're telling me that
I drive all the way out here

567
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:50,332
just to connect a loose sensor?

568
00:23:50,332 --> 00:23:52,172
- What's the sensor do?

569
00:23:52,172 --> 00:23:53,169
- Are you kidding me?

570
00:23:53,169 --> 00:23:55,589
You know maybe instead
of playing daddy in there

571
00:23:55,589 --> 00:23:57,127
day in and day out, you should sack up

572
00:23:57,127 --> 00:23:59,153
and take an interest in
your vehicle like a man.

573
00:23:59,153 --> 00:24:01,429
- I did take a interest in my vehicle.

574
00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:03,393
But those two that are in there,

575
00:24:03,393 --> 00:24:05,089
they really need me right now.

576
00:24:05,089 --> 00:24:06,812
So they're at the top of my list.

577
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,673
- Yeah but what about what you need?

578
00:24:08,673 --> 00:24:10,950
I mean dude, there are
so many women out there.

579
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,852
The best part is, there
are no strings attached.

580
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:17,270
- Actually, I kind of like her strings.

581
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,828
- But don't you ever get
tired of the same thing--

582
00:24:18,828 --> 00:24:20,652
- Hey, how's it going in here?

583
00:24:20,652 --> 00:24:21,968
- Hey, what's up?

584
00:24:21,968 --> 00:24:23,788
We are just finishing up right now.

585
00:24:23,788 --> 00:24:25,270
- Wow, that was quick.

586
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,068
- [Cadon] Mhmm, yeah we're on it.

587
00:24:27,068 --> 00:24:28,092
- Cool.

588
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,169
Did you ask him?

589
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:30,336
- Ask me what?

590
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:33,729
- Well Cadon's birthday is coming up

591
00:24:33,729 --> 00:24:37,292
and we talked about inviting
you to come celebrate with us.

592
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:39,932
- No, he didn't say a thing to me.

593
00:24:39,932 --> 00:24:40,765
- Yeah we were thinking about having

594
00:24:40,765 --> 00:24:41,782
like a party or something.

595
00:24:41,782 --> 00:24:43,884
- Yeah, daddy needs to
loosen up a little bit.

596
00:24:43,884 --> 00:24:46,140
- I can agree with you on that one.

597
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,684
- Yeah, I mean you guys
got a good place here.

598
00:24:48,684 --> 00:24:49,920
You know, we could have
a few friends over,

599
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,924
have some drinks.

600
00:24:50,924 --> 00:24:53,004
- I was thinking like low key.

601
00:24:53,004 --> 00:24:54,620
- No, Jess, seriously, I got this.

602
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,622
Don't even worry about it.

603
00:24:55,622 --> 00:24:57,680
I'll take care of everything.

604
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,538
- All right, but nothing crazy.

605
00:24:59,538 --> 00:25:01,919
You gotta keep it under control.

606
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,045
- You got it man, we'll keep it low key.

607
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:05,878
Trust me.

608
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:11,820
(hip hop music)

609
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,737
(crowd chattering)

610
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:39,653
What's going on man,
you having a good time?

611
00:25:39,653 --> 00:25:41,734
- Bo, I don't know any of these people.

612
00:25:41,734 --> 00:25:42,748
Who are they?

613
00:25:42,748 --> 00:25:43,893
- Oh dude, you just gotta
loosen up a little bit.

614
00:25:43,893 --> 00:25:44,896
Go mingle some, live a little.

615
00:25:44,896 --> 00:25:46,252
Hey everyone, listen up.

616
00:25:46,252 --> 00:25:47,750
Let's have a drink on the birthday boy!

617
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,000
(cheering)

618
00:26:02,148 --> 00:26:04,398
(retching)

619
00:26:07,028 --> 00:26:08,103
(Austin crying)

620
00:26:08,103 --> 00:26:12,022
- [Jess] I know, mommy
knows, I'm sorry. (mumbling)

621
00:26:12,022 --> 00:26:12,939
Here, here.

622
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:22,385
- When will this party be over?

623
00:26:22,385 --> 00:26:25,244
I can hear the music from my house.

624
00:26:25,244 --> 00:26:27,281
- But this party just started, lady!

625
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:28,465
Huh, yeah?

626
00:26:28,465 --> 00:26:30,907
- Young man, I will not
hesitate to call the police.

627
00:26:30,907 --> 00:26:32,223
- Whoah, whoah, whoah, hold on.

628
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:33,263
What's going on here?

629
00:26:33,263 --> 00:26:35,156
- [Neighbor] Is Jessica here?

630
00:26:35,156 --> 00:26:37,677
- Dude I really hope
that's not the stripper.

631
00:26:37,677 --> 00:26:39,899
(laughs)

632
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:42,779
(chattering)

633
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:47,279
- [Man] Look at your robe. (laughing)

634
00:26:52,117 --> 00:26:52,950
- Hey.

635
00:26:54,273 --> 00:26:55,106
Seriously?

636
00:27:10,913 --> 00:27:12,841
- Why are you so wet?

637
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:14,634
- Bo's little girlfriend decided to

638
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:17,219
spill a little beer on
me so now I'm drenched.

639
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:18,841
Do you know that there
are people having sex

640
00:27:18,841 --> 00:27:20,361
in our bedroom, Cadon?

641
00:27:20,361 --> 00:27:21,194
Yeah.

642
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:23,342
- I'm sorry.

643
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:24,419
It's not my fault though.

644
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:25,959
You know I don't know these people.

645
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:28,323
- I know, and I'm not mad.

646
00:27:28,323 --> 00:27:29,881
I'm really not mad.

647
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:31,001
But I just put our son down

648
00:27:31,001 --> 00:27:33,582
and he's trying to sleep and he can't.

649
00:27:33,582 --> 00:27:35,603
So you need to go and get them out, okay?

650
00:27:35,603 --> 00:27:37,182
Sorry.

651
00:27:37,182 --> 00:27:39,363
- I'm gonna go talk to Bo
but don't be mad at him.

652
00:27:39,363 --> 00:27:42,114
I mean this is just Bo being Bo.

653
00:27:42,114 --> 00:27:43,281
- I'm not mad.

654
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:26,053
(doorbell ringing)

655
00:28:29,886 --> 00:28:30,969
Can I help you?

656
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:34,206
- I'm here to perform my
child welfare check on Austin.

657
00:28:34,206 --> 00:28:35,225
Are you Jessica Clark?

658
00:28:35,225 --> 00:28:37,142
- Yeah, I'm his mother.

659
00:28:38,889 --> 00:28:40,905
You know, actually this
is a really bad time

660
00:28:40,905 --> 00:28:41,987
for both of us, I'm sorry.

661
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:44,476
- Well this is a good time for me.

662
00:28:44,476 --> 00:28:47,537
- Is there a way you could
come back later today?

663
00:28:47,537 --> 00:28:50,481
- I'm sorry, this is not an option.

664
00:28:50,481 --> 00:28:51,314
- Okay.

665
00:28:53,938 --> 00:28:55,800
What exactly is going on here?

666
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,133
- I was gonna ask you the same question.

667
00:29:06,998 --> 00:29:09,079
- So I see here that you
are currently on probation

668
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:11,341
for possession of a controlled substance,

669
00:29:11,341 --> 00:29:12,402
is that correct?

670
00:29:12,402 --> 00:29:13,880
- Yes sir.

671
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,898
- [Judge] Are you clean now?

672
00:29:14,898 --> 00:29:15,815
- Yes, sir.

673
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,467
Yes, I've never done drugs, sir.

674
00:29:23,122 --> 00:29:26,264
I had someone riding with me
in high school that had been.

675
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,864
- I see.

676
00:29:27,864 --> 00:29:29,560
Now this report I'm reading,

677
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,944
it doesn't look good, Miss Clark.

678
00:29:31,944 --> 00:29:32,777
- No sir.

679
00:29:33,755 --> 00:29:37,213
- Can you explain some of this to me?

680
00:29:37,213 --> 00:29:40,152
- Is that the report about
leaving Austin in the car

681
00:29:40,152 --> 00:29:41,819
or the welfare lady?

682
00:29:43,256 --> 00:29:44,973
- Oh, tell me about both.

683
00:29:44,973 --> 00:29:46,354
- Okay.

684
00:29:46,354 --> 00:29:49,293
With the car, Austin
had just fallen asleep

685
00:29:49,293 --> 00:29:54,093
and I went inside about
20 seconds to pay for gas.

686
00:29:54,093 --> 00:29:54,926
I made sure that I--

687
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,637
- Miss Clark.

688
00:29:56,637 --> 00:29:59,970
You left your child unattended in a car.

689
00:30:02,114 --> 00:30:03,677
That in itself is enough grounds

690
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:05,618
to remove him from your custody.

691
00:30:05,618 --> 00:30:07,074
Do you understand that?

692
00:30:07,074 --> 00:30:10,324
- I realize that, but it was just 20...

693
00:30:11,634 --> 00:30:12,467
Yes sir.

694
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:18,723
- Alan.

695
00:30:19,832 --> 00:30:23,582
Do you or your client
have anything to share?

696
00:30:24,895 --> 00:30:26,895
- [Alan] No, your honor.

697
00:30:27,747 --> 00:30:30,497
- Well I think I've heard enough.

698
00:30:32,306 --> 00:30:35,912
Miss Clark, you've been unable
to show me adequate proof

699
00:30:35,912 --> 00:30:37,329
of stable income.

700
00:30:39,613 --> 00:30:41,453
This letter from your probation officer

701
00:30:41,453 --> 00:30:43,432
is littered with concerns.

702
00:30:43,432 --> 00:30:45,810
And this report from CWS

703
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,691
says there was drug
paraphernalia in your home

704
00:30:48,691 --> 00:30:50,552
and someone passed out

705
00:30:50,552 --> 00:30:53,219
that you couldn't even identify.

706
00:30:54,829 --> 00:30:58,370
Miss Clark, I am seriously concerned

707
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:01,352
about the welfare and safety of your son.

708
00:31:01,352 --> 00:31:02,632
It is the order of this court

709
00:31:02,632 --> 00:31:04,768
that full parental custody in this case

710
00:31:04,768 --> 00:31:08,632
be granted to Mr. And Mrs. James Clark.

711
00:31:08,632 --> 00:31:10,952
- Sir, sir, I'd really like to explain.

712
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,426
- Miss Clark, we're done here.

713
00:31:13,426 --> 00:31:16,009
(somber music)

714
00:31:42,746 --> 00:31:45,413
(Austin crying)

715
00:32:15,555 --> 00:32:17,555
- Hey, has Jess come out the courthouse?

716
00:32:17,555 --> 00:32:20,811
- Yeah she's right out there on the bench.

717
00:32:20,811 --> 00:32:23,031
- Do we need to go talk to her?

718
00:32:23,031 --> 00:32:24,194
- I really don't think she wants to talk

719
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:26,189
to either one of us right now.

720
00:32:26,189 --> 00:32:28,669
- Well what if I go talk to her?

721
00:32:28,669 --> 00:32:30,091
- Yeah you could tell
her she can come see him

722
00:32:30,091 --> 00:32:31,575
anytime she wants and she could stay

723
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:32,935
as long as she wants.

724
00:32:32,935 --> 00:32:33,768
- Okay.

725
00:32:35,212 --> 00:32:38,295
(somber piano music)

726
00:32:40,812 --> 00:32:41,645
Jess.

727
00:32:42,934 --> 00:32:44,017
I'm so sorry.

728
00:32:49,228 --> 00:32:52,012
- How could they do that to me?

729
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:54,179
- They really do love you.

730
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:05,068
- Austin usually needs a nap around three

731
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:06,790
pretty much everyday,
and if he doesn't get one

732
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:09,548
you know what that means, so.

733
00:33:09,548 --> 00:33:12,128
And when you lay him down at night

734
00:33:12,128 --> 00:33:13,180
it needs to be completely quiet

735
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,299
and it takes about 30 minutes, you know,

736
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:16,246
to settle him down
because usually he's not,

737
00:33:16,246 --> 00:33:17,590
you know how hyper he always is.

738
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,507
Milk helps.

739
00:33:19,868 --> 00:33:23,046
But he needs a night light
because he's scared of the dark.

740
00:33:23,046 --> 00:33:26,604
And if he cries, he usually
does around like one

741
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,006
he wakes up sometimes.

742
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,470
If he cries, just make
sure somebody goes in there

743
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:33,089
and like rocks him 'cause
he'll just keep crying

744
00:33:33,089 --> 00:33:34,427
and keep crying and the next day

745
00:33:34,427 --> 00:33:35,702
he'll just be, he'll be a mess.

746
00:33:35,702 --> 00:33:37,505
He needs his sleep, so

747
00:33:37,505 --> 00:33:39,838
if you could just make sure.

748
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,152
- Jess.

749
00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:44,582
He's gonna be okay.

750
00:33:52,418 --> 00:33:55,001
(somber music)

751
00:34:13,313 --> 00:34:14,732
- [Jess] Hey, what are you doing here?

752
00:34:14,732 --> 00:34:15,793
- Hey.

753
00:34:15,793 --> 00:34:17,290
I don't have another call until three

754
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,908
so I came over to eat.

755
00:34:18,908 --> 00:34:20,390
- Oh okay.

756
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,628
Hey, I have one of your work shirts.

757
00:34:21,628 --> 00:34:23,850
You have any others that I need to wash?

758
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:26,683
- No, they're all clean right now.

759
00:34:28,134 --> 00:34:30,753
How you doing, how you feel?

760
00:34:30,753 --> 00:34:32,433
- I'm okay.

761
00:34:32,433 --> 00:34:34,748
I'll be all right.

762
00:34:34,748 --> 00:34:37,090
Feel like I'm in a dream

763
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,814
and it didn't really happen.

764
00:34:39,814 --> 00:34:41,356
- I was looking through these court papers

765
00:34:41,356 --> 00:34:45,334
and it says that after 12
months they're gonna review it.

766
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:48,134
And if you got a job and a place to live

767
00:34:48,134 --> 00:34:50,592
there's a good chance
we're gonna get him back.

768
00:34:50,592 --> 00:34:54,156
And it also says that if you were married

769
00:34:54,156 --> 00:34:57,174
that that could make it look a lot better,

770
00:34:57,174 --> 00:34:58,924
like a stable family.

771
00:35:00,012 --> 00:35:01,793
And another good thing is that

772
00:35:01,793 --> 00:35:04,134
you got the visitation
rights every weekend

773
00:35:04,134 --> 00:35:05,814
and they can't take that away from you

774
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:07,254
no matter what your parents say.

775
00:35:07,254 --> 00:35:10,450
- I don't think I can do that right now.

776
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,614
Seems like a little much.

777
00:35:12,614 --> 00:35:15,356
I don't really think I can look at them

778
00:35:15,356 --> 00:35:17,356
at this point, you know?

779
00:35:19,654 --> 00:35:22,753
- Just give it some time
and see how you feel.

780
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:25,409
Maybe things will be better this weekend.

781
00:35:25,409 --> 00:35:26,242
- Maybe.

782
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:28,643
We'll see.

783
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,260
- Want some bites, yeah?

784
00:35:41,259 --> 00:35:44,198
You're being such a big boy.

785
00:35:44,198 --> 00:35:45,238
- Hey Jenn, I wouldn't give him

786
00:35:45,238 --> 00:35:47,100
too many bites before dinner.

787
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,499
It'll ruin his appetite.

788
00:35:49,499 --> 00:35:51,782
Hey James, don't go far,
dinner's about ready.

789
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:52,782
- All right.

790
00:35:54,102 --> 00:35:57,142
- Mom, I know we're supposed
to be happy right now

791
00:35:57,142 --> 00:35:58,940
but I just can't help but think

792
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,302
how Jess is handling all this.

793
00:36:01,302 --> 00:36:03,601
- I've been thinking about her a lot too.

794
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:05,142
I know what we're doing is right.

795
00:36:05,142 --> 00:36:06,918
I just don't know if it's best.

796
00:36:06,918 --> 00:36:09,121
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

797
00:36:09,121 --> 00:36:10,460
- James?

798
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,198
What do you think?

799
00:36:12,198 --> 00:36:13,448
- I don't know.

800
00:36:14,556 --> 00:36:16,639
I just want some closure.

801
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:22,321
I mean I thought this would be it but

802
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:24,422
we still don't have Jess back.

803
00:36:24,422 --> 00:36:27,422
- So what are we supposed to do now?

804
00:36:28,822 --> 00:36:32,838
- Guess we'll just have
to keep trust in God.

805
00:36:32,838 --> 00:36:36,613
- Sometimes that's easier said than done.

806
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:37,863
- That's right.

807
00:36:46,544 --> 00:36:49,127
(somber music)

808
00:36:57,645 --> 00:36:59,112
- Hey.

809
00:36:59,112 --> 00:37:00,644
You just wake up?

810
00:37:00,644 --> 00:37:01,477
- No.

811
00:37:12,552 --> 00:37:14,302
- What are you doing?

812
00:37:15,284 --> 00:37:16,451
- I'm sitting.

813
00:37:23,009 --> 00:37:25,676
What are these doing out, Cadon?

814
00:37:31,227 --> 00:37:32,604
- Jess.

815
00:37:32,604 --> 00:37:33,724
What are you doing, come on.

816
00:37:33,724 --> 00:37:35,110
Stop.

817
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,366
- He's not coming home, Cadon.

818
00:37:37,366 --> 00:37:39,526
He's not, and you know that.

819
00:37:39,526 --> 00:37:41,446
- You gotta believe
he's coming back, Jess.

820
00:37:41,446 --> 00:37:42,470
You can't give up.

821
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:45,470
- I'm not giving up, I'm letting go.

822
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,917
(sobbing)

823
00:38:21,524 --> 00:38:24,215
- How many calls do you have today?

824
00:38:24,215 --> 00:38:27,632
- I had four, but three of them canceled.

825
00:38:32,055 --> 00:38:33,773
- That's not good.

826
00:38:33,773 --> 00:38:34,606
- Mmm-mmm.

827
00:38:39,808 --> 00:38:42,058
You look nice this morning.

828
00:38:51,424 --> 00:38:54,674
Hey lady, my friends say you look nice.

829
00:38:58,217 --> 00:39:00,517
I know I'm short, but do you hear me?

830
00:39:00,517 --> 00:39:02,160
- Cadon.

831
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:02,993
Just stop.

832
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:19,920
- So how's mom, how's
Kiera, how's everything?

833
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,997
- They're fine.

834
00:39:20,997 --> 00:39:22,741
- That's good, I'm glad.

835
00:39:22,741 --> 00:39:24,059
I'm glad everything is great.

836
00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:25,957
It's really good to see my daughter.

837
00:39:25,957 --> 00:39:28,037
I'm glad you're here.

838
00:39:28,037 --> 00:39:31,915
I need you to know that I am committed

839
00:39:31,915 --> 00:39:33,899
to fixing this family.

840
00:39:33,899 --> 00:39:35,557
- Dad.

841
00:39:35,557 --> 00:39:36,955
You do know it's gonna be a while

842
00:39:36,955 --> 00:39:39,301
before any of us can trust you.

843
00:39:39,301 --> 00:39:40,800
- I do, I know that.

844
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,300
I just want the opportunity
to show that I've changed.

845
00:39:46,715 --> 00:39:49,040
- We've heard this before, dad.

846
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,720
- I know you've heard this, I know,

847
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,661
I'm aware of it, but

848
00:39:52,661 --> 00:39:55,200
God has made some
amazingly wonderful things

849
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,539
happen in my life.

850
00:39:56,539 --> 00:40:01,221
In fact, he's opened doors
of which I have a job.

851
00:40:01,221 --> 00:40:02,917
- You have a job?

852
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:04,181
Where?

853
00:40:04,181 --> 00:40:06,219
- Working at a church.

854
00:40:06,219 --> 00:40:07,885
- A church?
- Yeah, a church.

855
00:40:07,885 --> 00:40:08,937
- [Daughter] What are
you doing at a church?

856
00:40:08,937 --> 00:40:13,376
- Environmental services
specialist, bother.

857
00:40:13,376 --> 00:40:15,209
- So you're a janitor.

858
00:40:16,342 --> 00:40:18,982
- Yeah, yeah your dad's a janitor.

859
00:40:18,982 --> 00:40:20,636
But it's a good thing.

860
00:40:20,636 --> 00:40:22,059
It's really wonderful.

861
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:26,758
And I have to go speak
Wednesday, next Wednesday

862
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:30,422
and I would really love it if you and mom

863
00:40:30,422 --> 00:40:32,538
and Kiera could all come down

864
00:40:32,538 --> 00:40:35,222
and really witness what I have to say.

865
00:40:35,222 --> 00:40:36,889
- I don't know, dad.

866
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,833
Maybe.

867
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:41,166
- That's good enough for me.

868
00:40:44,455 --> 00:40:46,705
(creaking)

869
00:40:53,979 --> 00:40:55,396
- Jess, I'm home.

870
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:00,952
Hey Jess.

871
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:03,516
Sweetheart.

872
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:11,102
(somber music)

873
00:41:25,522 --> 00:41:29,085
- So still Friday, it's
fine with me, let me know.

874
00:41:29,085 --> 00:41:30,739
I'll give you a call.

875
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:32,406
- I hate this place.

876
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,181
- Shawna, what are you talking about?

877
00:41:35,181 --> 00:41:36,819
- There's not any service.

878
00:41:36,819 --> 00:41:39,901
- There are more important
things than your phone.

879
00:41:39,901 --> 00:41:41,234
- Whatever, mom.

880
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:44,563
- Good evening, good evening everybody.

881
00:41:44,563 --> 00:41:46,179
- [Crowd] Good evening.

882
00:41:46,179 --> 00:41:47,619
- You'll be glad you came tonight.

883
00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:51,261
We are so blessed to
have with us this evening

884
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:53,428
someone whose story proves

885
00:41:54,499 --> 00:41:59,320
that Jesus is still in the
business of changing lives, amen?

886
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,235
So I wanna invite you to help me

887
00:42:01,235 --> 00:42:03,155
to welcome him to the stage right now.

888
00:42:03,155 --> 00:42:05,800
Andrew, would you come on
up, and share your question.

889
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,197
(crowd applauding)

890
00:42:09,197 --> 00:42:11,741
- I thought we hired this
guy to clean toilets.

891
00:42:11,741 --> 00:42:12,835
- Him and I have talked.

892
00:42:12,835 --> 00:42:14,668
This is gonna be good.

893
00:42:15,831 --> 00:42:20,190
- Well I hope he uses
words and not gang signs.

894
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:23,091
- First off, if it wasn't for Christ,

895
00:42:23,091 --> 00:42:25,987
in my life I would never
be standing in this room

896
00:42:25,987 --> 00:42:28,887
in front of you all tonight.

897
00:42:28,887 --> 00:42:31,950
I surely won't be in the
same room with the Sheriff

898
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,367
and the preacher.

899
00:42:34,211 --> 00:42:36,131
Unless the room had bars on it.

900
00:42:36,131 --> 00:42:38,214
(laughs)

901
00:42:40,007 --> 00:42:43,257
I know that sounds funny but it's true.

902
00:42:48,067 --> 00:42:53,067
Really though, spending
seven years in a prison cell,

903
00:42:53,209 --> 00:42:55,126
I had a big revelation.

904
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:05,228
I realized that only one
person could fix the mess

905
00:43:05,228 --> 00:43:07,731
that my life had become.

906
00:43:07,731 --> 00:43:09,898
And that person wasn't me.

907
00:43:14,451 --> 00:43:16,951
(baby crying)

908
00:43:33,376 --> 00:43:34,209
- Hey.

909
00:43:35,636 --> 00:43:36,719
What's wrong?

910
00:43:41,677 --> 00:43:42,510
Shh, shh.

911
00:43:43,907 --> 00:43:44,904
Shh.

912
00:43:44,904 --> 00:43:46,654
It's okay, it's okay.

913
00:43:53,491 --> 00:43:55,824
It's okay sweety, it's okay.

914
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:00,557
Oh sweet baby.

915
00:44:02,167 --> 00:44:04,750
You miss your mommy, don't you?

916
00:44:06,851 --> 00:44:08,518
I miss your mom too.

917
00:44:10,867 --> 00:44:13,450
(somber music)

918
00:44:19,915 --> 00:44:21,618
(doorbell ringing)

919
00:44:21,618 --> 00:44:22,618
Oh I got it.

920
00:44:26,075 --> 00:44:27,594
Jess, hey.

921
00:44:27,594 --> 00:44:29,344
It's good to see you.

922
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:31,755
Are you hungry?

923
00:44:31,755 --> 00:44:32,588
We just fixed something to eat.

924
00:44:32,588 --> 00:44:34,092
- I'm just here to see Austin.

925
00:44:34,092 --> 00:44:37,092
- Okay, he's in there with your dad.

926
00:44:38,615 --> 00:44:40,135
- Hey little guy.

927
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:41,655
I missed you.

928
00:44:41,655 --> 00:44:42,488
Oh I missed you.

929
00:44:42,488 --> 00:44:43,749
Oh it's so good to see you.

930
00:44:43,749 --> 00:44:44,976
Come here, give mommy a hug.

931
00:44:44,976 --> 00:44:45,973
Give mommy a big hug.

932
00:44:45,973 --> 00:44:47,056
I missed you.

933
00:44:51,093 --> 00:44:52,538
Can I have some alone time with my son?

934
00:44:52,538 --> 00:44:53,957
- [James] Sure.

935
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:58,101
Let's go in here, let Jess
have some time with Austin.

936
00:44:58,101 --> 00:45:00,101
- You're so big and tall.

937
00:45:00,101 --> 00:45:01,851
Oh, mommy missed you.

938
00:45:04,315 --> 00:45:05,797
- I can't believe she's here.

939
00:45:05,797 --> 00:45:07,461
- I know, but you've
got to go talk to her.

940
00:45:07,461 --> 00:45:08,757
- I can't.

941
00:45:08,757 --> 00:45:09,760
I don't know what to say.

942
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,280
- Yes you do, do the dad thing.

943
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,113
Ask where she's living.

944
00:45:12,113 --> 00:45:12,997
Does she have a job?

945
00:45:12,997 --> 00:45:14,166
- Why don't you go talk to her?

946
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:15,317
- No.

947
00:45:15,317 --> 00:45:17,797
- What you got here?

948
00:45:17,797 --> 00:45:18,630
A tractor?

949
00:45:21,157 --> 00:45:23,907
Oh you got a choo choo somewhere?

950
00:45:25,658 --> 00:45:28,180
(tense music)

951
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,778
- Did you see the way she looked at me?

952
00:45:29,778 --> 00:45:31,894
- You're imagining all that.
- I am not.

953
00:45:31,894 --> 00:45:33,757
We have got to bring Jess home.

954
00:45:33,757 --> 00:45:34,957
- I'll try.

955
00:45:34,957 --> 00:45:36,593
- Go, you can do this.

956
00:45:36,593 --> 00:45:38,843
- My goodness, you're busy.

957
00:45:39,696 --> 00:45:41,596
Where's Mr. Baba?

958
00:45:41,596 --> 00:45:42,896
What you got there?

959
00:45:42,896 --> 00:45:46,940
- Well we've been letting him
have a sippy cup here lately

960
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:50,700
and he's been going to the playgroup.

961
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,153
And he's been going to
church with us every Sunday.

962
00:45:53,153 --> 00:45:54,198
- Oh yeah.

963
00:45:54,198 --> 00:45:57,420
I bet he's potty trained
and he knows his ABCs too.

964
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,496
- Come on Jess.

965
00:45:58,496 --> 00:46:00,497
We just wanna work things out.

966
00:46:00,497 --> 00:46:02,460
Hey, how about you and your guy friend

967
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,655
come over here for
dinner and we can talk--

968
00:46:04,655 --> 00:46:07,215
- You don't even know his name do you?

969
00:46:07,215 --> 00:46:08,796
- Jess.
- Really, really.

970
00:46:08,796 --> 00:46:09,681
- Jess look, we just want what's best

971
00:46:09,681 --> 00:46:10,902
for you and Austin.

972
00:46:10,902 --> 00:46:12,711
- Is that what you want really?

973
00:46:12,711 --> 00:46:13,857
Did you want that at the court hearing?

974
00:46:13,857 --> 00:46:14,860
- Jess.

975
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:16,015
- 'Cause I don't think so.

976
00:46:16,015 --> 00:46:18,858
Because what I remember
is that you were quiet.

977
00:46:18,858 --> 00:46:20,058
You didn't say a single thing.

978
00:46:20,058 --> 00:46:21,194
- Jess.

979
00:46:21,194 --> 00:46:23,216
- And you know, you sat
there and watched it all

980
00:46:23,216 --> 00:46:24,597
and was silent.

981
00:46:24,597 --> 00:46:26,094
Mom got everything she wanted.

982
00:46:26,094 --> 00:46:27,455
- That is not fair, Jessica.

983
00:46:27,455 --> 00:46:28,571
- Don't even.

984
00:46:28,571 --> 00:46:30,027
I'm sorry baby, I'm sorry right now.

985
00:46:30,027 --> 00:46:31,387
- Jess, Jess.

986
00:46:31,387 --> 00:46:33,552
Jess, you can't take him.

987
00:46:33,552 --> 00:46:35,035
- [Jess] Get out of the way.

988
00:46:35,035 --> 00:46:36,512
- You cannot take him.

989
00:46:36,512 --> 00:46:37,712
Austin, come here.

990
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:39,379
You cannot take him.

991
00:46:44,895 --> 00:46:47,312
- I knew this was a bad idea.

992
00:46:49,878 --> 00:46:51,211
I am a good mom.

993
00:46:53,238 --> 00:46:54,518
I am a great mom

994
00:46:54,518 --> 00:46:57,036
and you don't even know.

995
00:46:57,036 --> 00:46:58,214
You don't know me.

996
00:46:58,214 --> 00:47:00,496
All you do is focus on the past.

997
00:47:00,496 --> 00:47:02,016
All the stupid things that I've done,

998
00:47:02,016 --> 00:47:05,099
you don't even know who I am anymore!

999
00:47:06,358 --> 00:47:09,514
You know what, you are ruining my life.

1000
00:47:09,514 --> 00:47:10,518
Is that what you want?

1001
00:47:10,518 --> 00:47:11,515
Does that make you happy?

1002
00:47:11,515 --> 00:47:14,118
I hope it does 'cause that's
exactly what you're doing.

1003
00:47:14,118 --> 00:47:15,201
- Jess, Jess!

1004
00:47:19,974 --> 00:47:21,334
Jess!

1005
00:47:21,334 --> 00:47:22,251
Jess, stop.

1006
00:47:23,696 --> 00:47:24,891
Jess.

1007
00:47:24,891 --> 00:47:26,415
- What?

1008
00:47:26,415 --> 00:47:28,015
- What happened?

1009
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:30,219
- What happened, are you serious?

1010
00:47:30,219 --> 00:47:33,739
Jenn, they took away my baby, my son.

1011
00:47:33,739 --> 00:47:35,153
I haven't seen him for six weeks

1012
00:47:35,153 --> 00:47:36,699
and I come to visit him and they just keep

1013
00:47:36,699 --> 00:47:37,755
rubbing it in my face

1014
00:47:37,755 --> 00:47:41,355
about how great they are
and how bad I am, I can't.

1015
00:47:41,355 --> 00:47:43,958
- They're not trying to
rub anything in your face.

1016
00:47:43,958 --> 00:47:46,235
They just want what's best for Austin.

1017
00:47:46,235 --> 00:47:48,480
Why are you acting like this?

1018
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,875
- Maybe you'll understand
someday when you're a mom.

1019
00:47:50,875 --> 00:47:54,182
- Jess, I've looked up
to you my entire life.

1020
00:47:54,182 --> 00:47:57,259
And honestly, I don't know
what's gotten into you.

1021
00:47:57,259 --> 00:47:59,356
You're a completely different person.

1022
00:47:59,356 --> 00:48:00,438
- I don't know.

1023
00:48:00,438 --> 00:48:01,659
Maybe I am different now.

1024
00:48:01,659 --> 00:48:03,382
Maybe that's what it is.

1025
00:48:03,382 --> 00:48:06,422
- See, it's comments like that.

1026
00:48:06,422 --> 00:48:08,378
What's gotten into you?

1027
00:48:08,378 --> 00:48:09,478
- Let's see.

1028
00:48:09,478 --> 00:48:11,942
I got pregnant when I was 17 years old.

1029
00:48:11,942 --> 00:48:13,142
Maybe it was that.

1030
00:48:13,142 --> 00:48:14,938
Or my parents disowned
me and I couldn't even

1031
00:48:14,938 --> 00:48:16,262
finish high school.

1032
00:48:16,262 --> 00:48:17,382
All my friends are losers

1033
00:48:17,382 --> 00:48:20,299
and to top it off, I lost the only thing

1034
00:48:20,299 --> 00:48:21,478
that ever mattered to me.

1035
00:48:21,478 --> 00:48:23,062
They took him away.

1036
00:48:23,062 --> 00:48:24,475
Gee, I can't imagine why I might be

1037
00:48:24,475 --> 00:48:26,182
a little bit different, Jenn.

1038
00:48:26,182 --> 00:48:27,836
- Jess, I know all of that.

1039
00:48:27,836 --> 00:48:29,440
I just don't understand why you keep

1040
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,600
making it harder on yourself.

1041
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,838
You just keep running away.

1042
00:48:32,838 --> 00:48:35,398
- What do you suggest I do then?

1043
00:48:35,398 --> 00:48:37,579
- Have you thought about
asking for forgiveness?

1044
00:48:37,579 --> 00:48:39,062
- Are you serious?

1045
00:48:39,062 --> 00:48:41,995
There is no way in hell
that I'd ever go in there

1046
00:48:41,995 --> 00:48:43,440
and ask those people for forgiveness.

1047
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,035
No, no.

1048
00:48:45,035 --> 00:48:48,535
- Jess, I'm not talking about mom and dad.

1049
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,138
- I wish it was that easy, I really do.

1050
00:48:56,138 --> 00:48:56,971
It's not.

1051
00:48:58,683 --> 00:48:59,600
I gotta go.

1052
00:49:15,504 --> 00:49:17,402
- [Cadon] Hey, how'd it go?

1053
00:49:17,402 --> 00:49:19,222
- Not well, obviously

1054
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:21,424
since Austin's not with me.

1055
00:49:21,424 --> 00:49:23,562
I drove two hours there, two hours back

1056
00:49:23,562 --> 00:49:25,734
and I had five minutes
with Austin, that was it.

1057
00:49:25,734 --> 00:49:26,651
And I left.

1058
00:49:27,702 --> 00:49:29,142
I don't know what happened, I just,

1059
00:49:29,142 --> 00:49:30,614
- Whoah, start from the beginning.

1060
00:49:30,614 --> 00:49:31,618
Tell me what went on.

1061
00:49:31,618 --> 00:49:33,062
- It doesn't matter what went on, Cadon.

1062
00:49:33,062 --> 00:49:34,544
I don't even know why I'm here.

1063
00:49:34,544 --> 00:49:35,660
I don't know why I came back.

1064
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:36,966
I don't know why I live here.

1065
00:49:36,966 --> 00:49:39,802
And whatever this is,
I don't know anymore.

1066
00:49:39,802 --> 00:49:41,083
I don't know anything.

1067
00:49:41,083 --> 00:49:42,682
- What are you saying?

1068
00:49:42,682 --> 00:49:43,984
What do you mean you don't know

1069
00:49:43,984 --> 00:49:45,099
why you came back?

1070
00:49:45,099 --> 00:49:47,542
- Cadon, if I hadn't have met you

1071
00:49:47,542 --> 00:49:49,003
then Austin would be with me

1072
00:49:49,003 --> 00:49:50,597
and none of this mess would have happened.

1073
00:49:50,597 --> 00:49:52,514
And that's true.

1074
00:49:52,514 --> 00:49:54,431
- How can you say that?

1075
00:49:55,318 --> 00:49:56,568
We're a family!

1076
00:49:57,514 --> 00:50:01,371
I love you, I support
you, I stand behind you.

1077
00:50:01,371 --> 00:50:03,072
And more importantly, you know what,

1078
00:50:03,072 --> 00:50:05,088
I love Austin too.

1079
00:50:05,088 --> 00:50:06,251
- Cadon, you didn't do anything.

1080
00:50:06,251 --> 00:50:08,032
I'm not blaming you.

1081
00:50:08,032 --> 00:50:10,148
I'm blaming Bo who decided to throw

1082
00:50:10,148 --> 00:50:12,949
a raging party and thinks alcohol,

1083
00:50:12,949 --> 00:50:14,532
and don't touch me.

1084
00:50:16,005 --> 00:50:18,208
Cadon, you don't get it.

1085
00:50:18,208 --> 00:50:19,968
And I know you're trying
and I know you're trying

1086
00:50:19,968 --> 00:50:21,135
but you don't.

1087
00:50:25,968 --> 00:50:27,301
I can't breathe.

1088
00:50:32,069 --> 00:50:34,208
Do you know what that's
like when you can't even

1089
00:50:34,208 --> 00:50:38,128
wake up in the morning
because you have this giant

1090
00:50:38,128 --> 00:50:40,085
emptiness that's sitting on your chest?

1091
00:50:40,085 --> 00:50:42,505
And I don't want to do that anymore.

1092
00:50:42,505 --> 00:50:44,805
I don't wanna be here.

1093
00:50:44,805 --> 00:50:46,629
And I don't know how you
expect me to sit here

1094
00:50:46,629 --> 00:50:49,088
and soak it in anymore because I can't.

1095
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:50,265
And I don't want to.

1096
00:50:50,265 --> 00:50:52,932
- Wait, don't walk away.
- Don't!

1097
00:50:57,429 --> 00:51:00,185
- What are you saying you
don't wanna be here anymore?

1098
00:51:00,185 --> 00:51:02,245
You're all I got!

1099
00:51:02,245 --> 00:51:04,985
You talking about leaving?

1100
00:51:04,985 --> 00:51:07,003
This is just temporary.

1101
00:51:07,003 --> 00:51:08,885
Okay if you think for one
minute that I'm gonna wait

1102
00:51:08,885 --> 00:51:11,269
11 months for them
folks to make a decision

1103
00:51:11,269 --> 00:51:13,102
on our lives, I'm not.

1104
00:51:14,229 --> 00:51:15,625
He's coming home, Jess.

1105
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:17,765
He's coming home soon.

1106
00:51:17,765 --> 00:51:19,265
Do you believe me?

1107
00:51:24,105 --> 00:51:26,725
Well you believe this.

1108
00:51:26,725 --> 00:51:29,349
Tomorrow, I'm walking out that door

1109
00:51:29,349 --> 00:51:32,849
and I'm finding a way to get our son back.

1110
00:51:35,829 --> 00:51:38,246
(gun firing)

1111
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:53,349
- Cadon, what are you doing out here?

1112
00:51:53,349 --> 00:51:54,491
- I went by the shop.

1113
00:51:54,491 --> 00:51:55,872
They said I could find you out here.

1114
00:51:55,872 --> 00:51:57,872
- Yeah, that's where I'm usually at.

1115
00:51:57,872 --> 00:51:58,705
You wanna give it a shot?

1116
00:51:58,705 --> 00:51:59,538
- No, Bo, listen.

1117
00:51:59,538 --> 00:52:01,067
I didn't come out here today to shoot.

1118
00:52:01,067 --> 00:52:02,234
We gotta talk.

1119
00:52:03,389 --> 00:52:04,891
- All right, so this is probably about

1120
00:52:04,891 --> 00:52:06,754
what happened at the party then.

1121
00:52:06,754 --> 00:52:08,010
- No, Bo, listen.

1122
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:10,090
This really ain't about that.

1123
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:11,372
It's about Jess, man.

1124
00:52:11,372 --> 00:52:14,573
She just, she's falling apart, man.

1125
00:52:14,573 --> 00:52:16,471
She's a mess.

1126
00:52:16,471 --> 00:52:18,594
I don't know what to do.

1127
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:20,215
- Who says you have to do anything?

1128
00:52:20,215 --> 00:52:23,229
You could just walk away right now.

1129
00:52:23,229 --> 00:52:25,771
- Man, you don't understand.

1130
00:52:25,771 --> 00:52:27,521
Jess is all I've got.

1131
00:52:28,551 --> 00:52:31,255
Austin's gone, man, he was my everything.

1132
00:52:31,255 --> 00:52:36,135
I don't know if I'm supposed
to call some attorney or...

1133
00:52:36,135 --> 00:52:36,968
I don't know what to do.
- Hold on, hold on.

1134
00:52:36,968 --> 00:52:37,826
Hold on one second.

1135
00:52:37,826 --> 00:52:40,030
So you're telling me that the government

1136
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:42,489
came into your house, took your son,

1137
00:52:42,489 --> 00:52:44,009
messed up your home,
messed up your family,

1138
00:52:44,009 --> 00:52:45,129
messed up your girl

1139
00:52:45,129 --> 00:52:48,030
and you're talking about getting
some pretty boy attorney?

1140
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:50,306
- What am I supposed to do?

1141
00:52:50,306 --> 00:52:51,906
- I'm not telling you what to do,

1142
00:52:51,906 --> 00:52:53,566
but if it was me, if I were
in your shoes right now,

1143
00:52:53,566 --> 00:52:56,307
I would go take my son back.

1144
00:52:56,307 --> 00:52:58,190
- What are you saying, I
should go kidnap my son?

1145
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:00,465
- Just listen to what you just said.

1146
00:53:00,465 --> 00:53:01,550
How are you gonna kidnap something

1147
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:02,830
that's yours in the first place?

1148
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:06,866
They're the ones that went
and kidnapped your son.

1149
00:53:06,866 --> 00:53:08,699
- What do you suggest?

1150
00:53:11,587 --> 00:53:14,787
(somber music)

1151
00:53:14,787 --> 00:53:16,286
Hey baby, we gotta talk.

1152
00:53:16,286 --> 00:53:17,282
- What is he doing here?

1153
00:53:17,282 --> 00:53:18,343
He needs to leave.

1154
00:53:18,343 --> 00:53:19,352
- He came by to help.

1155
00:53:19,352 --> 00:53:21,021
- No, that's funny that you say help

1156
00:53:21,021 --> 00:53:22,997
because I remember the
last time he decided

1157
00:53:22,997 --> 00:53:25,797
he needed to help us and what
happened with this family

1158
00:53:25,797 --> 00:53:26,663
so you need to go.
- All right Jess, look.

1159
00:53:26,663 --> 00:53:28,582
No, listen to me.
- You need to go.

1160
00:53:28,582 --> 00:53:30,522
- I'm sorry, okay?

1161
00:53:30,522 --> 00:53:31,672
I know I screwed up.

1162
00:53:31,672 --> 00:53:32,505
And that's why I'm here.

1163
00:53:32,505 --> 00:53:33,672
I'm here to try and help you guys out.

1164
00:53:33,672 --> 00:53:35,303
I wanna make this right.

1165
00:53:35,303 --> 00:53:36,856
So please, hear me out.

1166
00:53:36,856 --> 00:53:37,939
- Please sweety, look.

1167
00:53:37,939 --> 00:53:38,772
It's just two minutes.

1168
00:53:38,772 --> 00:53:39,633
Just hear him out, that's all we're doing.

1169
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:40,630
We're just talking.

1170
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:41,830
Please, two minutes?

1171
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:43,580
Please come sit down.

1172
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:51,708
- Me and Cadon have been talking

1173
00:53:51,708 --> 00:53:54,070
and we both agreed that
going through the courts

1174
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:56,428
is just not the way to handle this.

1175
00:53:56,428 --> 00:53:57,612
I mean you could spend years in there

1176
00:53:57,612 --> 00:53:59,407
and never see your son again.

1177
00:53:59,407 --> 00:54:01,728
So what I'm saying we do is
we go get in the car right now

1178
00:54:01,728 --> 00:54:02,732
and we go take your son.

1179
00:54:02,732 --> 00:54:03,565
- [Cadon] We just go get him.

1180
00:54:03,565 --> 00:54:04,465
- No.

1181
00:54:04,465 --> 00:54:05,766
No, this is stupid.

1182
00:54:05,766 --> 00:54:07,382
You both sound completely
ridiculous right now.

1183
00:54:07,382 --> 00:54:08,560
Really Bo?

1184
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,198
- Hold on, all we're doing is talking.

1185
00:54:10,198 --> 00:54:11,031
It could work, okay?

1186
00:54:11,031 --> 00:54:12,837
Right now we've got
nothing else to work with.

1187
00:54:12,837 --> 00:54:14,137
Please just listen.

1188
00:54:14,137 --> 00:54:15,941
Please, come on.

1189
00:54:15,941 --> 00:54:17,381
- Whatever.

1190
00:54:17,381 --> 00:54:19,098
- Look, I'm serious, Jess.

1191
00:54:19,098 --> 00:54:20,296
Just work with me here.

1192
00:54:20,296 --> 00:54:22,559
Where's he staying at right now?

1193
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:23,562
- My parents.

1194
00:54:23,562 --> 00:54:25,838
- Yeah, okay so if you
just give me some time,

1195
00:54:25,838 --> 00:54:28,570
I can put a plan together
and we can make this work.

1196
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:30,333
We can get your son back.

1197
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:31,778
- Is it just me?

1198
00:54:31,778 --> 00:54:33,880
I mean am I the only person that thinks

1199
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,515
this sounds completely crazy?

1200
00:54:35,515 --> 00:54:38,094
- Jessica, I know this sounds crazy.

1201
00:54:38,094 --> 00:54:42,738
But right now, crazy might
just be the best option.

1202
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:44,235
We gotta do something.

1203
00:54:44,235 --> 00:54:45,720
I miss him.

1204
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,517
Baby, I miss you.

1205
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:49,688
I want our family back.

1206
00:54:49,688 --> 00:54:51,938
Please baby, we gotta get our son back.

1207
00:54:51,938 --> 00:54:53,138
We gotta do something.

1208
00:54:53,138 --> 00:54:55,555
Please, do it for me, please.

1209
00:55:02,155 --> 00:55:03,155
- All right.

1210
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:04,967
All right.

1211
00:55:05,994 --> 00:55:08,077
What do you need to know?

1212
00:55:10,096 --> 00:55:10,929
(light rock music)

1213
00:55:10,929 --> 00:55:13,679
- Let's go ladies, stretch it up.

1214
00:55:14,672 --> 00:55:17,005
I need you guys loose today.

1215
00:55:20,634 --> 00:55:21,861
Shawna, get loose get loose.

1216
00:55:21,861 --> 00:55:23,194
Jenn, get loose.

1217
00:55:24,057 --> 00:55:25,658
- Come on girls, let's get loose!

1218
00:55:25,658 --> 00:55:27,035
- Can I have a snack under the bag?

1219
00:55:27,035 --> 00:55:28,198
- No, honey, dad's gonna take us out

1220
00:55:28,198 --> 00:55:30,220
to eat after the game.

1221
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:31,217
- [Karl] Hey Roger.

1222
00:55:31,217 --> 00:55:32,050
- [Roger] How you doing?

1223
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:33,253
- [Karl] How are you, brother?

1224
00:55:33,253 --> 00:55:34,433
- We've got this.

1225
00:55:34,433 --> 00:55:37,073
Jenn, you're gonna start
off on the sidelines

1226
00:55:37,073 --> 00:55:39,516
but I'm gonna get everybody
in today, all right?

1227
00:55:39,516 --> 00:55:41,287
- [Sherry] You think
Jenn's gonna play today?

1228
00:55:41,287 --> 00:55:42,287
- I hope so.

1229
00:55:43,243 --> 00:55:44,545
- Shawna.

1230
00:55:44,545 --> 00:55:46,455
Get your head in the game today, okay?

1231
00:55:46,455 --> 00:55:47,288
- [Shawna] Okay.

1232
00:55:47,288 --> 00:55:48,828
- Stay in the game, stay focused

1233
00:55:48,828 --> 00:55:50,865
and intimidate those girls.

1234
00:55:50,865 --> 00:55:53,202
- I'm glad my dad's not like that.

1235
00:55:53,202 --> 00:55:54,266
- Nope.

1236
00:55:54,266 --> 00:55:55,849
- [Shawna] Bye dad.

1237
00:55:57,409 --> 00:56:00,942
(crowd cheering)

1238
00:56:00,942 --> 00:56:02,862
- Let's go, Shawna!

1239
00:56:02,862 --> 00:56:04,464
Come on Shawna, let's go!

1240
00:56:04,464 --> 00:56:06,064
- Go to space, go to space.

1241
00:56:06,064 --> 00:56:08,843
Move it over, polygon position, let's go!

1242
00:56:08,843 --> 00:56:10,704
- Come on Shawna, team leader!

1243
00:56:10,704 --> 00:56:12,363
- Woo!
- All right!

1244
00:56:12,363 --> 00:56:15,097
- Good job Shawna, keep it up!

1245
00:56:15,097 --> 00:56:16,197
- Watch the trap!

1246
00:56:16,197 --> 00:56:18,960
Watch the trap coming on the other side!

1247
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,960
(whistle blowing)
(crowd booing)

1248
00:56:24,837 --> 00:56:25,670
- What just happened?

1249
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:27,157
- Shawna!

1250
00:56:27,157 --> 00:56:27,990
You're out!

1251
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:30,407
Come on, come on, you're out.

1252
00:56:32,008 --> 00:56:33,791
Jenn, you're in, you're in.

1253
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,028
Come on Shawna, get off the field.

1254
00:56:35,028 --> 00:56:36,427
- You're gonna put her in?
- Come on!

1255
00:56:36,427 --> 00:56:37,714
Sit down!

1256
00:56:37,714 --> 00:56:39,112
Sit down!
- This is so stupid!

1257
00:56:39,112 --> 00:56:40,109
- Come on in.

1258
00:56:40,109 --> 00:56:41,510
- I started, this is stupid!

1259
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:42,710
Are you kidding me?

1260
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:43,544
This is dumb!
- What?!

1261
00:56:43,544 --> 00:56:44,903
What are you doing?!

1262
00:56:44,903 --> 00:56:46,929
You don't pull her out of the game!

1263
00:56:46,929 --> 00:56:48,247
Shawna, get back in there!

1264
00:56:48,247 --> 00:56:50,049
Put her back in the game!

1265
00:56:50,049 --> 00:56:50,983
- Karl!
- Pull my girl,

1266
00:56:50,983 --> 00:56:52,065
what are you doing?!

1267
00:56:52,065 --> 00:56:54,215
- Ho, ho.
- You're not our coach!

1268
00:56:54,215 --> 00:56:56,732
That's ridiculous, pull
her out of the game!

1269
00:56:56,732 --> 00:56:58,593
- What is he doing?

1270
00:56:58,593 --> 00:57:00,429
- She's the best player on your team!

1271
00:57:00,429 --> 00:57:02,017
- Hey let's go girls, get focused,

1272
00:57:02,017 --> 00:57:03,596
get refocused on this.

1273
00:57:03,596 --> 00:57:05,516
- Do me a favor and just cool off.

1274
00:57:05,516 --> 00:57:09,137
I don't need you out here
going after the coach.

1275
00:57:09,137 --> 00:57:11,887
(crowd cheering)

1276
00:57:22,438 --> 00:57:23,962
- [Bo] This is it.

1277
00:57:23,962 --> 00:57:25,562
(metal music)

1278
00:57:25,562 --> 00:57:27,061
- At church?

1279
00:57:27,061 --> 00:57:29,882
You wanna do this here, really?

1280
00:57:29,882 --> 00:57:30,882
- Yeah, why?

1281
00:57:32,441 --> 00:57:34,020
- That's kind of messed up.

1282
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,418
- No man.

1283
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:37,757
What's messed up is the lies
that they tell in that place.

1284
00:57:37,757 --> 00:57:39,562
I mean they hoard people in,

1285
00:57:39,562 --> 00:57:44,340
brainwash them and all
they want is their money.

1286
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:46,673
Besides, it's a soft target.

1287
00:57:48,476 --> 00:57:50,159
- All right, so

1288
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:53,497
say we go in there and we get Austin,

1289
00:57:53,497 --> 00:57:54,634
what happens then?

1290
00:57:54,634 --> 00:57:56,596
I mean where am I supposed to go?

1291
00:57:56,596 --> 00:57:58,138
People are gonna be looking for me.

1292
00:57:58,138 --> 00:58:00,116
- I know some people
that can help you out.

1293
00:58:00,116 --> 00:58:02,799
As long as you're careful
and stay under the radar,

1294
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:04,049
you'll be fine.

1295
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,533
- Hey!

1296
00:58:16,533 --> 00:58:17,515
- What?

1297
00:58:17,515 --> 00:58:18,870
- [Karl] What are you wearing?

1298
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,592
- I'm wearing clothes.

1299
00:58:20,592 --> 00:58:21,891
Katie's waiting for me.

1300
00:58:21,891 --> 00:58:24,612
- You are not leaving this
house dressed like that.

1301
00:58:24,612 --> 00:58:26,416
- It took me an hour to get ready, dad.

1302
00:58:26,416 --> 00:58:28,032
- I don't care if you took two hours.

1303
00:58:28,032 --> 00:58:29,035
You're not leaving this house

1304
00:58:29,035 --> 00:58:30,155
dressed like a prostitute.

1305
00:58:30,155 --> 00:58:31,536
- Really dad?

1306
00:58:31,536 --> 00:58:33,056
That's what you're gonna call me?

1307
00:58:33,056 --> 00:58:34,432
- Well if the shoe fits.

1308
00:58:34,432 --> 00:58:36,112
- Karl, what's the big deal?

1309
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:37,252
- She's half naked!

1310
00:58:37,252 --> 00:58:39,515
- I think it looks cute.

1311
00:58:39,515 --> 00:58:41,091
- It doesn't look cute.

1312
00:58:41,091 --> 00:58:43,172
Is this my family now?

1313
00:58:43,172 --> 00:58:44,175
- Really dad?

1314
00:58:44,175 --> 00:58:45,750
I saw what you were watching last night.

1315
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:46,976
- You shut your mouth!

1316
00:58:46,976 --> 00:58:49,252
- Mom, I'm leaving.

1317
00:58:49,252 --> 00:58:51,936
- Shawna, you get back here!

1318
00:58:51,936 --> 00:58:52,769
Shawna!

1319
00:58:52,769 --> 00:58:54,269
- Karl, calm down.

1320
00:58:55,148 --> 00:58:57,372
- She has no respect for me.

1321
00:58:57,372 --> 00:58:58,622
- I wonder why.

1322
00:59:10,433 --> 00:59:11,447
- Now if we do this right

1323
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:13,633
we can be in and out within 45 seconds.

1324
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,670
Jess they already know you so you're out.

1325
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:17,014
You're gonna be in the car the whole time.

1326
00:59:17,014 --> 00:59:19,110
It's gonna be me, you and Dylan.

1327
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:20,428
- Wait, you're gonna
bring your little brother

1328
00:59:20,428 --> 00:59:21,426
in on this?

1329
00:59:21,426 --> 00:59:22,259
- Yeah he loves this kind of stuff,

1330
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:23,126
don't worry about it.

1331
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:24,450
We have three objectives.

1332
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:26,487
We need to get Austin,

1333
00:59:26,487 --> 00:59:28,290
we need to create a diversion

1334
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:29,451
and we cut the phone lines so that

1335
00:59:29,451 --> 00:59:30,946
we can have a little head start.

1336
00:59:30,946 --> 00:59:31,986
Since Austin knows you,

1337
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:33,506
you're gonna be the one that grabs him.

1338
00:59:33,506 --> 00:59:35,302
Dylan's gonna take care of the phone lines

1339
00:59:35,302 --> 00:59:36,882
and I'm gonna take care of the diversion.

1340
00:59:36,882 --> 00:59:38,280
- Okay, you keep saying diversion.

1341
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:39,282
What do you plan on doing?

1342
00:59:39,282 --> 00:59:41,682
- Just cause a little
commotion, nothing big.

1343
00:59:41,682 --> 00:59:42,882
- What kind of commotion?

1344
00:59:42,882 --> 00:59:44,626
- Just don't worry about it, man,

1345
00:59:44,626 --> 00:59:45,666
it's not a big deal.

1346
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:46,920
All right, the best time to go

1347
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,546
is Sunday around four o'clock.

1348
00:59:48,546 --> 00:59:50,285
That's whenever your
parents are gonna be there,

1349
00:59:50,285 --> 00:59:52,583
the door's will be unlocked, and,

1350
00:59:52,583 --> 00:59:54,045
- Are you all ready for dessert?

1351
00:59:54,045 --> 00:59:56,628
- Just the check, sweet cheeks.

1352
00:59:58,903 --> 01:00:00,306
So can y'all be ready by Sunday?

1353
01:00:00,306 --> 01:00:01,303
- Yeah we'll be ready.

1354
01:00:01,303 --> 01:00:02,407
- Just so you both know,

1355
01:00:02,407 --> 01:00:05,106
I do not like this idea.

1356
01:00:05,106 --> 01:00:06,226
And I mean I know we're gonna do it

1357
01:00:06,226 --> 01:00:08,146
but if anybody gets hurt

1358
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:10,045
or anything happens to anybody,

1359
01:00:10,045 --> 01:00:11,484
I'm not gonna be able to forgive you.

1360
01:00:11,484 --> 01:00:13,826
I won't, I promise.

1361
01:00:13,826 --> 01:00:15,826
- Can we get that check?

1362
01:00:17,522 --> 01:00:19,189
- [Waitress] Thanks.

1363
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:22,002
- [Bo] Don't worry about it man, I got it.

1364
01:00:22,002 --> 01:00:22,835
- [Cadon] You sure?

1365
01:00:22,835 --> 01:00:23,938
- Yeah, don't worry about it.

1366
01:00:23,938 --> 01:00:27,261
- Bo, you've always been
there for me, always.

1367
01:00:27,261 --> 01:00:28,818
- Just be ready for Sunday, okay?

1368
01:00:28,818 --> 01:00:30,818
- [Cadon] I'ma be ready.

1369
01:00:49,608 --> 01:00:50,608
- Hey.
- Hmm.

1370
01:00:52,049 --> 01:00:56,348
- It's gonna be bizarre
going back there tomorrow.

1371
01:00:56,348 --> 01:00:59,030
Have you ever been to church?

1372
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:03,588
- Yeah, I went a couple
times when I was little.

1373
01:01:03,588 --> 01:01:07,748
I really didn't like it so I quit going.

1374
01:01:07,748 --> 01:01:10,788
- I used to go to church all the time.

1375
01:01:10,788 --> 01:01:13,288
Every Sunday since I was born.

1376
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:18,969
- [Cadon] So what, you one
of those religious people?

1377
01:01:18,969 --> 01:01:22,302
- Yeah, I guess you could say religious.

1378
01:01:24,831 --> 01:01:27,998
What about you, do you believe in God?

1379
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:32,073
- I believe in God.

1380
01:01:32,073 --> 01:01:34,210
I mean I believe there's a God out there.

1381
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:37,210
But I only think about it that much.

1382
01:01:38,793 --> 01:01:41,460
God's god and we're just people.

1383
01:01:43,172 --> 01:01:44,005
- Yeah.

1384
01:01:46,233 --> 01:01:49,108
Seems kind of silly, doesn't it,

1385
01:01:49,108 --> 01:01:50,708
the whole religion thing.

1386
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:51,958

- No, no.

1412
01:03:52,513 --> 01:03:54,031
There are too many people here today.

1413
01:03:54,031 --> 01:03:55,029
No, we're not doing this.

1414
01:03:55,029 --> 01:03:56,031
Not today.

1415
01:03:56,031 --> 01:03:57,690
- Jess, you know exactly how many people

1416
01:03:57,690 --> 01:03:58,687
were gonna be in here.

1417
01:03:58,687 --> 01:04:00,187
Stick to the plan.

1418
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:03,050
- Did Jerry know to be
here at four o'clock today?

1419
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:04,948
- He told me this morning he'd be here.

1420
01:04:04,948 --> 01:04:07,448
Sheriffs make their own hours.

1421
01:04:08,539 --> 01:04:09,622
- I thought we hired our new janitor

1422
01:04:09,622 --> 01:04:11,596
to do stuff like this.

1423
01:04:11,596 --> 01:04:13,276
- I told him we can handle this.

1424
01:04:13,276 --> 01:04:15,655
- It's be nice if we
had some wire strippers.

1425
01:04:15,655 --> 01:04:18,054
- Fellas, really glad you guys came out

1426
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:19,378
to help me with this here.

1427
01:04:19,378 --> 01:04:21,234
Would have taken me all day, man.

1428
01:04:21,234 --> 01:04:22,249
Thank you much.

1429
01:04:22,249 --> 01:04:23,255
How's it going out there.

1430
01:04:23,255 --> 01:04:24,088
Do you need anything?

1431
01:04:24,088 --> 01:04:24,921
- If we had the right tools,

1432
01:04:24,921 --> 01:04:26,914
work could be through
with this real quick.

1433
01:04:26,914 --> 01:04:28,363
- Plenty of tools in
the maintenance closet.

1434
01:04:28,363 --> 01:04:29,686
Let me go pick those up.

1435
01:04:29,686 --> 01:04:30,885
Be right back, all right?

1436
01:04:30,885 --> 01:04:34,369
Thank you guys, really appreciate it.

1437
01:04:34,369 --> 01:04:36,422
- And under the ground, the beets run red,

1438
01:04:36,422 --> 01:04:37,985
and the carrots grew yellow

1439
01:04:37,985 --> 01:04:39,969
and the potato sprouts grew bigger.

1440
01:04:39,969 --> 01:04:41,525
- Jenn, do you mind changing him?

1441
01:04:41,525 --> 01:04:42,358
He stinks.

1442
01:04:43,223 --> 01:04:44,369
- Can you please help me out?

1443
01:04:44,369 --> 01:04:46,065
Like why are you even in here?

1444
01:04:46,065 --> 01:04:48,084
- My mom made me come in here

1445
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:50,326
and it's your nephew.

1446
01:04:50,326 --> 01:04:52,576
(whirring)

1447
01:04:55,526 --> 01:04:57,169
- How's Jessica doing?

1448
01:04:57,169 --> 01:04:58,502
She's such a sweetheart.

1449
01:04:58,502 --> 01:05:00,347
- We got to see her the other day.

1450
01:05:00,347 --> 01:05:01,345
- [Woman] Really?

1451
01:05:01,345 --> 01:05:03,089
- But it didn't end well.

1452
01:05:03,089 --> 01:05:05,672
We really need a lot of prayer.

1453
01:05:07,889 --> 01:05:10,166
- What did I do to make
you hate me so much?

1454
01:05:10,166 --> 01:05:12,006
I thought we were friends.

1455
01:05:12,006 --> 01:05:14,845
- I don't need another person to judge me.

1456
01:05:14,845 --> 01:05:16,806
- How do I judge you?

1457
01:05:16,806 --> 01:05:18,924
- You're just like everyone
else in this place.

1458
01:05:18,924 --> 01:05:20,268
You think because you have Jesus

1459
01:05:20,268 --> 01:05:23,946
you can tell people what
they can and can't do.

1460
01:05:23,946 --> 01:05:26,267
- If I remember correctly,
last summer at camp

1461
01:05:26,267 --> 01:05:28,517
you said you had Jesus too.

1462
01:05:30,124 --> 01:05:32,129
- See your parents' car anywhere?

1463
01:05:32,129 --> 01:05:34,209
- Yeah it's the red one.

1464
01:05:34,209 --> 01:05:37,286
- All right, that's all we needed.

1465
01:05:37,286 --> 01:05:40,305
- Does everybody remember
what you're supposed to do?

1466
01:05:40,305 --> 01:05:42,785
Hey, listen up, man.

1467
01:05:42,785 --> 01:05:43,809
You know what you're supposed to do?

1468
01:05:43,809 --> 01:05:45,926
- [Dylan] Yeah, got it.

1469
01:05:45,926 --> 01:05:47,521
- Look, I have to get his diaper bag.

1470
01:05:47,521 --> 01:05:49,583
Can you please watch him for a second?

1471
01:05:49,583 --> 01:05:52,333
- Sure, but I'm not touching him.

1472
01:05:53,744 --> 01:05:55,163
- You have always been on my prayer list

1473
01:05:55,163 --> 01:05:57,723
and you've always been in my heart.

1474
01:05:57,723 --> 01:06:00,223
I really think she'll
be back, I really do.

1475
01:06:00,223 --> 01:06:02,224
But we have to remember.

1476
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:05,641
It's not on our time, it's on God's time.

1477
01:06:06,566 --> 01:06:08,507
And I'm gonna keep praying for you.

1478
01:06:08,507 --> 01:06:10,122
- Thank you.

1479
01:06:10,122 --> 01:06:13,227
- That's my sister, get back.

1480
01:06:13,227 --> 01:06:14,384
We can't go now.

1481
01:06:14,384 --> 01:06:15,829
No, we can't go.

1482
01:06:15,829 --> 01:06:16,662
Not with my sister in there.

1483
01:06:16,662 --> 01:06:18,059
She'll freak out.

1484
01:06:18,059 --> 01:06:19,856
- Your son is in there.

1485
01:06:19,856 --> 01:06:21,273
We're doing this.

1486
01:06:27,437 --> 01:06:29,219
- Hey I'm all about second chances

1487
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:32,500
but I think we made a big
mistake hiring that guy.

1488
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,121
- I just gotta ask.

1489
01:06:34,121 --> 01:06:36,517
Is is because he's black?

1490
01:06:36,517 --> 01:06:38,178
Do you have a problem with that?

1491
01:06:38,178 --> 01:06:39,378
'Cause that's what it seems like to me.

1492
01:06:39,378 --> 01:06:42,295
- Hey, that's your words, not mine.

1493
01:06:45,219 --> 01:06:46,398
- Bo, what is that?

1494
01:06:46,398 --> 01:06:47,540
You can't bring a gun in there!

1495
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:48,373
- What?

1496
01:06:48,373 --> 01:06:49,208
- [Bo] It's all part of the plan, man.

1497
01:06:49,208 --> 01:06:50,062
It's just for intimidation.

1498
01:06:50,062 --> 01:06:51,700
- No, you're kidding me, no.

1499
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:52,744
Put it back, we're done.

1500
01:06:52,744 --> 01:06:53,747
I mean it.

1501
01:06:53,747 --> 01:06:55,347
You're not taking a gun in there!

1502
01:06:55,347 --> 01:06:56,349
- [Bo] Jess, quit it, stop!

1503
01:06:56,349 --> 01:06:57,448
- No, you're not taking a gun

1504
01:06:57,448 --> 01:06:59,055
with my son and my family in there.

1505
01:06:59,055 --> 01:07:00,013
So put it back!

1506
01:07:00,013 --> 01:07:00,846
Cadon, go!

1507
01:07:00,846 --> 01:07:01,679
- [Bo] Will you shut up for a minute?

1508
01:07:01,679 --> 01:07:03,154
- No, this is done!

1509
01:07:03,154 --> 01:07:05,115
- I'm not entirely convinced at this point

1510
01:07:05,115 --> 01:07:06,906
that you even want your son back.

1511
01:07:06,906 --> 01:07:08,246
You just wanna abandon him, really?

1512
01:07:08,246 --> 01:07:09,913
Like after all this?

1513
01:07:11,126 --> 01:07:12,876
It's not even loaded.

1514
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:17,393
- Fine.

1515
01:07:17,393 --> 01:07:18,640
But make it quick.

1516
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:19,772
In and out.

1517
01:07:19,772 --> 01:07:23,212
And don't point it at anybody, okay?

1518
01:07:23,212 --> 01:07:24,770
- Jess, get in the front seat.

1519
01:07:24,770 --> 01:07:26,103
Switch with her.

1520
01:07:36,301 --> 01:07:38,384
- I can still smell that.

1521
01:07:39,404 --> 01:07:41,563
- I'll throw it away in a second.

1522
01:07:41,563 --> 01:07:45,643
Look, Shawna, I'm sorry
if I was judging you.

1523
01:07:45,643 --> 01:07:47,608
It wasn't my intention.

1524
01:07:47,608 --> 01:07:49,208
You're my friend and I care about you

1525
01:07:49,208 --> 01:07:52,283
and I just want you to know
that there's more to live for

1526
01:07:52,283 --> 01:07:54,366
than what most people do.

1527
01:07:57,245 --> 01:07:59,745
(tense music)

1528
01:08:34,404 --> 01:08:35,491
- What are you doing, man?

1529
01:08:35,491 --> 01:08:36,658
Set it up, go.

1530
01:08:55,768 --> 01:08:58,728
- We're still gonna smell
that when you take it.

1531
01:08:58,728 --> 01:09:03,311
- Check the cabinet, there
might be some air freshener.

1532
01:09:09,747 --> 01:09:10,681
- Keep your mouth shut
and no one gets hurt.

1533
01:09:10,681 --> 01:09:11,514
Get over by the table.

1534
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:12,347
- Sheriff, is that you?

1535
01:09:12,347 --> 01:09:13,180
- Lady, shut up and turn around.

1536
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:14,983
Put the money in the bag, let's go!

1537
01:09:14,983 --> 01:09:17,426
Hurry up, put it all in the bag, let's go!

1538
01:09:17,426 --> 01:09:19,009
You got 20 seconds!

1539
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:40,507
(knocking)

1540
01:09:44,368 --> 01:09:45,711
- [Sheriff] Jessica?

1541
01:09:45,711 --> 01:09:47,150
Hey Jessica.

1542
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:49,650
I haven't seen you in forever.

1543
01:09:52,464 --> 01:09:53,711
- Hey Austin.

1544
01:09:53,711 --> 01:09:55,988
Come here buddy, come here.

1545
01:09:55,988 --> 01:09:57,646
Hey.

1546
01:09:57,646 --> 01:10:00,809
His grandparents told
me to come and get him.

1547
01:10:00,809 --> 01:10:01,642
- Okay.

1548
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:05,001
- [Cadon] Come on, come on.

1549
01:10:08,484 --> 01:10:10,692
(tense music)

1550
01:10:10,692 --> 01:10:13,109
- Turn around, face the wall.

1551
01:10:15,072 --> 01:10:16,070
- Your mom's just inside.

1552
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:17,417
Let me tell her that you're here.

1553
01:10:17,417 --> 01:10:18,735
- You know, don't.

1554
01:10:18,735 --> 01:10:19,853
She knows.

1555
01:10:19,853 --> 01:10:20,914
She knows I'm here.

1556
01:10:20,914 --> 01:10:22,738
- Well, good talking to you.

1557
01:10:22,738 --> 01:10:25,297
Great to see you, take care.

1558
01:10:25,297 --> 01:10:26,130
- Okay.

1559
01:10:27,191 --> 01:10:30,693
Sure though, what are you doing here?

1560
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:32,636
- Oh I just help with the
offering count on Sundays

1561
01:10:32,636 --> 01:10:35,219
and I'm running a bit late too.

1562
01:10:37,137 --> 01:10:39,387
(creaking)

1563
01:10:53,196 --> 01:10:55,529
- Actually, I was wondering.

1564
01:10:57,217 --> 01:11:00,214
Are you still a police officer?

1565
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:03,797
- County Sheriff now,
going on three years.

1566
01:11:06,352 --> 01:11:07,893
- Where's Austin?

1567
01:11:07,893 --> 01:11:09,850
- Your parents had some guy pick him up.

1568
01:11:09,850 --> 01:11:10,852
- [Jenn] Who?

1569
01:11:10,852 --> 01:11:12,693
- I don't know, Austin ran right to him.

1570
01:11:12,693 --> 01:11:14,988
- No, Austin's supposed to be hin here.

1571
01:11:14,988 --> 01:11:16,133
- I'm really running late.

1572
01:11:16,133 --> 01:11:17,865
I gotta get in there and

1573
01:11:17,865 --> 01:11:19,305
sure is good to see you though.

1574
01:11:19,305 --> 01:11:20,888
- Yeah.
- Take care.

1575
01:11:30,725 --> 01:11:31,982
- Excuse me, can I help you?

1576
01:11:31,982 --> 01:11:33,662
- Oh, no, I'm just leaving, take you.

1577
01:11:33,662 --> 01:11:36,339
- That's the Clarks' grandson, right?

1578
01:11:36,339 --> 01:11:38,462
- Yeah, yeah, they told
me to come get him.

1579
01:11:38,462 --> 01:11:40,295
- Oh they did?
- Yeah.

1580
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,821
- Okay well, you don't mind
if we go confirm that, do you?

1581
01:11:43,821 --> 01:11:45,059
- I really don't have time.

1582
01:11:45,059 --> 01:11:46,557
What are you doing, hey?

1583
01:11:46,557 --> 01:11:47,890
Wait, let me go!

1584
01:11:51,173 --> 01:11:52,650
- [Susan] Do you have your cellphone?

1585
01:11:52,650 --> 01:11:54,483
- No, I don't have it.

1586
01:11:58,827 --> 01:12:00,577
- This phone is dead.

1587
01:12:05,211 --> 01:12:06,044
- Calm down now.

1588
01:12:06,044 --> 01:12:07,058
- What are you doing?
- Easy.

1589
01:12:07,058 --> 01:12:08,396
This is the toughest part, okay?

1590
01:12:08,396 --> 01:12:09,238
- [Cadon] Let me go!

1591
01:12:09,238 --> 01:12:10,756
- Let him go!

1592
01:12:10,756 --> 01:12:11,999
- Hey!

1593
01:12:11,999 --> 01:12:12,914
Put the gun down.

1594
01:12:12,914 --> 01:12:15,091
- [Bo] Don't be stupid, man.

1595
01:12:15,091 --> 01:12:16,758
- Put that gun down.

1596
01:12:18,306 --> 01:12:20,806
(tense music)

1597
01:12:33,666 --> 01:12:34,941
Hey, put the gun down.

1598
01:12:34,941 --> 01:12:36,461
- Take your hand off that gun.

1599
01:12:36,461 --> 01:12:38,128
- Put your gun down.

1600
01:12:42,487 --> 01:12:44,205
- Don't be stupid, man.

1601
01:12:44,205 --> 01:12:46,403
- I'm gonna tell you
again, put the gun down.

1602
01:12:46,403 --> 01:12:48,052
(gun firing)

1603
01:12:48,052 --> 01:12:50,302
(groaning)

1604
01:12:52,053 --> 01:12:53,576
- What was that?

1605
01:12:53,576 --> 01:12:55,743
- I don't know, stay here.

1606
01:12:57,119 --> 01:12:57,952
- Bo!

1607
01:12:58,821 --> 01:13:01,404
(somber music)

1608
01:13:14,341 --> 01:13:15,738
- Austin, come here.

1609
01:13:15,738 --> 01:13:17,155
Here, here, come.

1610
01:13:24,821 --> 01:13:25,654
- Cadon!

1611
01:13:28,299 --> 01:13:29,132
Cadon!

1612
01:13:29,132 --> 01:13:30,382
- Help me Jess.

1613
01:13:32,661 --> 01:13:33,494
- What did you do?

1614
01:13:33,494 --> 01:13:36,161
- He went for his gun, I had to!

1615
01:13:41,387 --> 01:13:42,462
- We have to get out of here.

1616
01:13:42,462 --> 01:13:43,467
- What's going on?

1617
01:13:43,467 --> 01:13:44,880
- I don't know what's going on.

1618
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:45,963
I just saw a guy with a gun,

1619
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:46,796
a boy and a girl.

1620
01:13:46,796 --> 01:13:47,629
We have to go!
- Boy and a girl?

1621
01:13:47,629 --> 01:13:48,683
Come on.

1622
01:13:48,683 --> 01:13:49,861
- Look, stick to the plan.

1623
01:13:49,861 --> 01:13:51,323
Where's Austin at?

1624
01:13:51,323 --> 01:13:53,616
Cadon, where's Austin at?

1625
01:13:53,616 --> 01:13:55,259
Go find him.

1626
01:13:55,259 --> 01:13:56,374
- Help me, Bo.

1627
01:13:56,374 --> 01:13:57,207
- Go!

1628
01:13:59,212 --> 01:14:01,575
Cadon, snap out of it, he's dead, come on.

1629
01:14:01,575 --> 01:14:02,992
Get up, let's go.

1630
01:14:06,529 --> 01:14:09,029
(tense music)

1631
01:14:10,652 --> 01:14:11,485
- Jess!

1632
01:14:11,485 --> 01:14:12,891
- Hey!
- What are you doing here?

1633
01:14:12,891 --> 01:14:14,308
- Give me Austin.

1634
01:14:15,756 --> 01:14:16,956
- Jess, what's going on?

1635
01:14:16,956 --> 01:14:19,493
Did somebody get shot?

1636
01:14:19,493 --> 01:14:21,276
- Yeah.
- What?

1637
01:14:21,276 --> 01:14:22,534
- Come with me, you'll be fine.

1638
01:14:22,534 --> 01:14:23,617
Stay with me.

1639
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:28,583
(somber music)

1640
01:14:28,583 --> 01:14:29,948
- [Woman] What are we gonna do?

1641
01:14:29,948 --> 01:14:31,128
- We're getting a phone.

1642
01:14:31,128 --> 01:14:31,961
In my car.

1643
01:14:43,281 --> 01:14:44,460
- What?

1644
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:45,964
What else do you expect me to do?

1645
01:14:45,964 --> 01:14:47,804
- [Cadon] He's dead, Bo.

1646
01:14:47,804 --> 01:14:48,903
- Yeah, and you'd be dead too

1647
01:14:48,903 --> 01:14:50,965
if I wouldn't have stepped in.

1648
01:14:50,965 --> 01:14:52,165
Where's Dylan at?

1649
01:14:52,165 --> 01:14:53,381
Is he in the car?

1650
01:14:53,381 --> 01:14:55,381
- He never came outside.

1651
01:14:56,846 --> 01:14:57,850
- Who's that?

1652
01:14:57,850 --> 01:14:59,146
- Come on man, let's just go.

1653
01:14:59,146 --> 01:15:00,845
- We're not leaving without Dylan.

1654
01:15:00,845 --> 01:15:01,678
Stay here.

1655
01:15:05,706 --> 01:15:08,206
(tense music)

1656
01:15:12,464 --> 01:15:13,297
Hey, stop!

1657
01:15:13,297 --> 01:15:16,217
(gun firing)

1658
01:15:16,217 --> 01:15:17,621
- Man, did you blow a breaker?

1659
01:15:17,621 --> 01:15:18,964
- That wasn't a breaker.

1660
01:15:18,964 --> 01:15:20,881
Let me go check it out.

1661
01:15:22,243 --> 01:15:24,715
- Come on, let's go, no one's leaving.

1662
01:15:24,715 --> 01:15:25,665
Hurry it up!

1663
01:15:25,665 --> 01:15:26,832
Come on, move!

1664
01:15:35,102 --> 01:15:36,229
Go, get in there, come on.

1665
01:15:36,229 --> 01:15:39,135
Let's go, come on, left, left!

1666
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:40,799
Get in there.

1667
01:15:40,799 --> 01:15:42,319
Dude we gotta get everybody in there.

1668
01:15:42,319 --> 01:15:43,556
There's people everywhere.

1669
01:15:43,556 --> 01:15:44,852
Hey!

1670
01:15:44,852 --> 01:15:45,850
Let's go, come on.

1671
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:48,921
Round the corner, yeah, let's go, run!

1672
01:15:48,921 --> 01:15:51,504
- [Jenn] Jess, what's going on?

1673
01:15:55,983 --> 01:15:57,733
- That fucking moron.

1674
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:01,156
- Hey, everyone where I
can see you, let's go!

1675
01:16:01,156 --> 01:16:02,580
Get away from the door!

1676
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:03,577
Get away!

1677
01:16:03,577 --> 01:16:04,580
(gun firing)

1678
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:07,721
Get away from the doors,
let's go, get to the middle!

1679
01:16:07,721 --> 01:16:09,539
You too, get over here, let's go!

1680
01:16:09,539 --> 01:16:13,039
No talking, everyone shut up and sit down!

1681
01:16:15,879 --> 01:16:17,619
All right, here are the rules.

1682
01:16:17,619 --> 01:16:19,319
No talking, nobody stands up,

1683
01:16:19,319 --> 01:16:21,139
nobody tries anything!

1684
01:16:21,139 --> 01:16:22,600
You try anything, I start shooting,

1685
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,563
does everybody understand?

1686
01:16:24,563 --> 01:16:26,403
Do you understand?!

1687
01:16:26,403 --> 01:16:27,320
No talking!

1688
01:16:30,861 --> 01:16:31,694
- Where's Austin?

1689
01:16:31,694 --> 01:16:32,527
Have you seen Austin?

1690
01:16:32,527 --> 01:16:33,360
- I was in here.

1691
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:34,384
- [Sherry] Jenn, where's Austin?

1692
01:16:34,384 --> 01:16:35,687
- They're out, Jess has him.

1693
01:16:35,687 --> 01:16:36,749
- [Karl] Where's your mother at?

1694
01:16:36,749 --> 01:16:38,104
- I don't know.

1695
01:16:38,104 --> 01:16:38,937
- [Karl] You haven't seen her?

1696
01:16:38,937 --> 01:16:40,807
- No, she told me to go to the nursery.

1697
01:16:40,807 --> 01:16:41,805
- [Karl] She's not in the nursery?

1698
01:16:41,805 --> 01:16:43,245
- No!

1699
01:16:43,245 --> 01:16:44,507
- [Cadon] Yeah just
scoot down the hall, go.

1700
01:16:44,507 --> 01:16:46,576
Scoot down the hall.

1701
01:16:46,576 --> 01:16:47,902
- Dude we have to keep
these people in here.

1702
01:16:47,902 --> 01:16:49,601
I'll watch them, you go find Dylan.

1703
01:16:49,601 --> 01:16:51,663
- Dylan's probably already gone, man.

1704
01:16:51,663 --> 01:16:53,743
We got Austin, mission accomplished.

1705
01:16:53,743 --> 01:16:54,987
Let's just get out of here.

1706
01:16:54,987 --> 01:16:56,240
- He's in here.

1707
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:57,883
This is one way in, one way out.

1708
01:16:57,883 --> 01:16:59,627
They keep everything locked in here.

1709
01:16:59,627 --> 01:17:00,710
He's in here.

1710
01:17:01,939 --> 01:17:03,344
- Fine, watch these people.

1711
01:17:03,344 --> 01:17:05,511
I'm gonna go look for him.

1712
01:17:19,045 --> 01:17:20,181
- You checked the doors?

1713
01:17:20,181 --> 01:17:22,325
- I didn't bring my keys.

1714
01:17:22,325 --> 01:17:23,835
- Why would they be locked?

1715
01:17:23,835 --> 01:17:28,002
- We started locking them
ever since the break in.

1716
01:17:30,155 --> 01:17:30,988
- Dylan!

1717
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:40,233
- Is that seven?

1718
01:17:41,354 --> 01:17:44,100
- Excuse me, hey,
ladies, ladies. (banging)

1719
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:45,119
Hey, turn that off.

1720
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:46,116
We gotta go to the big room.

1721
01:17:46,116 --> 01:17:46,975
Everybody's meeting in there.

1722
01:17:46,975 --> 01:17:48,011
I need you all to come with me now.

1723
01:17:48,011 --> 01:17:49,025
- Are you okay?

1724
01:17:49,025 --> 01:17:50,027
- Yeah I'm fine, look,

1725
01:17:50,027 --> 01:17:51,026
somebody got hurt.

1726
01:17:51,026 --> 01:17:52,491
We're trying to get everybody
over to the big room.

1727
01:17:52,491 --> 01:17:53,910
Please, come on, we gotta go now.

1728
01:17:53,910 --> 01:17:54,992
- Are you sure you're okay?

1729
01:17:54,992 --> 01:17:56,768
- I'm positive, I need
you to come with me now,

1730
01:17:56,768 --> 01:17:58,548
I'm serious, we need your help.

1731
01:17:58,548 --> 01:18:01,749
Now come out this door
and follow me, come on.

1732
01:18:01,749 --> 01:18:03,385
Come on, will you come on?!

1733
01:18:03,385 --> 01:18:05,385
- Okay.
- I'm coming, I'm coming!

1734
01:18:05,385 --> 01:18:06,218
- Come on.

1735
01:18:08,792 --> 01:18:09,625
Bo!

1736
01:18:10,793 --> 01:18:13,171
- All right, come on, hurry up, let's go.

1737
01:18:13,171 --> 01:18:14,338
Come on, move!

1738
01:18:17,215 --> 01:18:18,215
Get in here.

1739
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:20,567
- Sir, please, can I check on him?

1740
01:18:20,567 --> 01:18:21,570
I'm a nurse.

1741
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:22,546
- [Bo] He's dead, get in there.

1742
01:18:22,546 --> 01:18:23,379
Move!

1743
01:18:27,586 --> 01:18:28,419
- Dylan!

1744
01:18:29,527 --> 01:18:31,610
Come on man, we gotta go!

1745
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:40,538
- You know what,

1746
01:18:40,538 --> 01:18:42,404
the best thing for us
to start doing right now

1747
01:18:42,404 --> 01:18:43,321
is to pray.

1748
01:18:44,619 --> 01:18:45,801
We're already on our knees.

1749
01:18:45,801 --> 01:18:48,143
All we have to do is just
start praying to God.

1750
01:18:48,143 --> 01:18:49,263
God'll take care of it.

1751
01:18:49,263 --> 01:18:50,884
- [Old Man] Yeah, y'all pray.

1752
01:18:50,884 --> 01:18:52,520
I'm gonna keep looking right down.

1753
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:54,618
- You know what, we
should have never agreed

1754
01:18:54,618 --> 01:18:55,823
to take Austin.

1755
01:18:55,823 --> 01:18:56,656
- Sherry.

1756
01:18:56,656 --> 01:18:58,198
- No, really.

1757
01:18:58,198 --> 01:18:59,542
- Has anybody called the police?

1758
01:18:59,542 --> 01:19:00,618
- Not that I know of.

1759
01:19:00,618 --> 01:19:02,982
Nobody has a signal.

1760
01:19:02,982 --> 01:19:04,039
- Mom, can we go home soon?

1761
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:06,981
- No, honey, we're gonna
be here a little while.

1762
01:19:06,981 --> 01:19:08,119
- I think you need to pray too.

1763
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:10,629
We all need to be praying right now.

1764
01:19:10,629 --> 01:19:13,546
- I'm gonna pray with my eyes open.

1765
01:19:17,366 --> 01:19:20,033
(hip hop music)

1766
01:19:22,842 --> 01:19:25,893
- Look, let's just get Austin

1767
01:19:25,893 --> 01:19:28,310
and we get out of here, okay?

1768
01:19:31,035 --> 01:19:32,118
Okay?
- Okay.

1769
01:19:37,087 --> 01:19:38,102
- Dylan!

1770
01:19:38,102 --> 01:19:40,685
Hey come on man, open the door!

1771
01:19:48,111 --> 01:19:49,728
Open the door, come on!

1772
01:19:49,728 --> 01:19:50,784
We gotta go!

1773
01:19:50,784 --> 01:19:53,284
Hurry, come on open this door!

1774
01:20:00,622 --> 01:20:01,955
Bo.

1775
01:20:01,955 --> 01:20:04,098
Man, I checked the phone
closet, it's locked.

1776
01:20:04,098 --> 01:20:06,280
I beat on the door and
Dylan's not answering.

1777
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:08,798
Every other door on this
place is locked too.

1778
01:20:08,798 --> 01:20:10,337
He's gotta be outside somewhere, man.

1779
01:20:10,337 --> 01:20:11,170
Let's get out of here!

1780
01:20:11,170 --> 01:20:12,003
- He's in there.

1781
01:20:12,003 --> 01:20:14,503
Just let me get you some keys.

1782
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:19,307
All right, who has the
keys to the building?

1783
01:20:20,681 --> 01:20:23,014
Let's go, who has the keys?!

1784
01:20:25,593 --> 01:20:27,260
- Cadon, I want out.

1785
01:20:28,153 --> 01:20:29,868
We gotta get him out of here.

1786
01:20:29,868 --> 01:20:31,012
I don't wanna be here.

1787
01:20:31,012 --> 01:20:31,845
Why is this?

1788
01:20:31,845 --> 01:20:32,793
- It's gonna be okay baby,

1789
01:20:32,793 --> 01:20:33,812
don't worry about it.

1790
01:20:33,812 --> 01:20:34,746
Look, we're gonna get out of here.

1791
01:20:34,746 --> 01:20:37,070
- No, it's not okay.

1792
01:20:37,070 --> 01:20:38,682
He's dead.

1793
01:20:38,682 --> 01:20:41,082
And I've known him my
entire life and he's dead!

1794
01:20:41,082 --> 01:20:42,362
- Don't look over there,
we didn't do that.

1795
01:20:42,362 --> 01:20:43,685
Hey, that's not us.

1796
01:20:43,685 --> 01:20:45,503
Don't look over there.

1797
01:20:45,503 --> 01:20:47,786
- Who let you in this morning?

1798
01:20:47,786 --> 01:20:48,619
- It was open when I got here.

1799
01:20:48,619 --> 01:20:49,659
- [Bo] I better get an answer soon,

1800
01:20:49,659 --> 01:20:50,506
who has the keys?

1801
01:20:50,506 --> 01:20:51,408
- The janitor has the keys.

1802
01:20:51,408 --> 01:20:53,152
- Tell him.

1803
01:20:53,152 --> 01:20:55,062
- The janitor has the keys.

1804
01:20:55,062 --> 01:20:55,895
- [Bo] Where is he at?

1805
01:20:55,895 --> 01:20:57,723
- He's over cleaning the bathroom.

1806
01:20:57,723 --> 01:20:59,678
- You, go get him.

1807
01:20:59,678 --> 01:21:00,511
- [Shawna] Me?

1808
01:21:00,511 --> 01:21:01,344
- [Bo] Yes!

1809
01:21:01,344 --> 01:21:02,177
- I don't want to!

1810
01:21:02,177 --> 01:21:03,503
- [Bo] It wasn't a question, go get him!

1811
01:21:03,503 --> 01:21:04,505
- I'll do it.

1812
01:21:04,505 --> 01:21:05,565
- No, look, I'll go get it.

1813
01:21:05,565 --> 01:21:06,482
- Sit down.

1814
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:08,237
You, go.

1815
01:21:09,843 --> 01:21:12,206
You can get everyone's cellphones.

1816
01:21:12,206 --> 01:21:13,203
- No.

1817
01:21:13,203 --> 01:21:14,179
- [Bo] Get up!

1818
01:21:14,179 --> 01:21:16,346
(sobbing)

1819
01:21:22,024 --> 01:21:22,963
- Sir?

1820
01:21:22,963 --> 01:21:23,796
Sir, sir.

1821
01:21:24,984 --> 01:21:26,259
We need your keys.

1822
01:21:26,259 --> 01:21:28,024
- My keys, what's going on?

1823
01:21:28,024 --> 01:21:29,806
- Yeah, there's a guy with
a gun, he needs your keys.

1824
01:21:29,806 --> 01:21:30,883
Just come on.

1825
01:21:30,883 --> 01:21:31,716
- What?

1826
01:21:31,716 --> 01:21:32,843
- [Jenn] I'm being serious.

1827
01:21:32,843 --> 01:21:34,593
- Give me your phone.

1828
01:21:36,543 --> 01:21:39,043
Where's your phone?
- Hurry up!

1829
01:21:44,181 --> 01:21:45,014
- Just take Austin and go.

1830
01:21:45,014 --> 01:21:45,847
Come on, we can leave.

1831
01:21:45,847 --> 01:21:46,680
- Cadon, you don't get it.

1832
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,214
My family is in there!

1833
01:21:48,214 --> 01:21:51,419
I'm not just gonna leave them.

1834
01:21:51,419 --> 01:21:53,979
- Then you take Austin and go.

1835
01:21:53,979 --> 01:21:56,822
I'll go in there and I'll take care of Bo.

1836
01:21:56,822 --> 01:21:58,315
And I'll take care of your family.

1837
01:21:58,315 --> 01:22:00,898
They would want you to be safe.

1838
01:22:02,294 --> 01:22:03,127
Just go.

1839
01:22:08,533 --> 01:22:09,366
- Oh.

1840
01:22:10,233 --> 01:22:12,066
What is going on here?

1841
01:22:13,212 --> 01:22:14,478
Are you guys okay, is everybody all right?

1842
01:22:14,478 --> 01:22:15,311
- [Bo] The keys, let's go!

1843
01:22:15,311 --> 01:22:17,296
- Got the keys right
here, everything's good.

1844
01:22:17,296 --> 01:22:18,629
- Give 'em here.

1845
01:22:20,459 --> 01:22:22,635
- [Andrew] You know where those go?

1846
01:22:22,635 --> 01:22:23,468
- [Bo] Do you?

1847
01:22:23,468 --> 01:22:24,301
- Every one of them.

1848
01:22:24,301 --> 01:22:25,808
I know all the doors in this place.

1849
01:22:25,808 --> 01:22:26,788
- [Bo] You're coming with me.

1850
01:22:26,788 --> 01:22:28,871
- You got it.
- Let's go.

1851
01:22:31,489 --> 01:22:33,089
Hey, hey, hey, hold up, hold up, hold up.

1852
01:22:33,089 --> 01:22:34,062
Where are you going?

1853
01:22:34,062 --> 01:22:37,329
- She's going outside to the car.

1854
01:22:37,329 --> 01:22:38,583
That was part of the plan, remember?

1855
01:22:38,583 --> 01:22:39,585
She's gonna get it ready.

1856
01:22:39,585 --> 01:22:41,281
- Plan has changed, man.

1857
01:22:41,281 --> 01:22:42,268
In fact I think you need to get in there

1858
01:22:42,268 --> 01:22:43,388
with everybody else.

1859
01:22:43,388 --> 01:22:45,388
- What's the matter, she's on our team.

1860
01:22:45,388 --> 01:22:47,383
- I don't know who's on my team right now.

1861
01:22:47,383 --> 01:22:48,946
Let's go, come on.

1862
01:22:48,946 --> 01:22:49,946
- It's okay.

1863
01:22:51,488 --> 01:22:53,905
I'll just keep an eye on him.

1864
01:22:55,989 --> 01:22:58,913
(somber music)

1865
01:22:58,913 --> 01:23:00,580
- What is she doing?

1866
01:23:10,311 --> 01:23:11,350
- Dude you've got the keys.

1867
01:23:11,350 --> 01:23:13,356
You two go find him.

1868
01:23:13,356 --> 01:23:15,937
If he tries anything, I'm
gonna start shooting everybody.

1869
01:23:15,937 --> 01:23:16,770
I don't care.

1870
01:23:16,770 --> 01:23:17,916
- Hey, I'm just opening doors.

1871
01:23:17,916 --> 01:23:19,615
- Look, Bo, we're gonna find your brother.

1872
01:23:19,615 --> 01:23:21,458
Just promise me you
won't shoot anybody else.

1873
01:23:21,458 --> 01:23:23,041
- Just go find him.

1874
01:23:31,127 --> 01:23:33,242
(thudding)

1875
01:23:33,242 --> 01:23:35,242
- [Dylan] Stupid church.

1876
01:23:45,133 --> 01:23:47,300
(banging)

1877
01:23:54,133 --> 01:23:54,966
- Dylan!

1878
01:23:58,254 --> 01:23:59,671
Hey come on, man!

1879
01:24:02,047 --> 01:24:03,892
- We've gotta come up with a plan.

1880
01:24:03,892 --> 01:24:04,905
We can't just sit here.

1881
01:24:04,905 --> 01:24:06,025
- Let's just pray.

1882
01:24:06,025 --> 01:24:07,428
Come on, let's just pray.

1883
01:24:07,428 --> 01:24:10,788
- No, we need to find
something to fight back.

1884
01:24:10,788 --> 01:24:13,668
- [Susan] We need to pray.

1885
01:24:13,668 --> 01:24:16,191
- I'm gonna go over there to her.

1886
01:24:16,191 --> 01:24:17,193
- Be careful.

1887
01:24:17,193 --> 01:24:18,610
- [James] I will.

1888
01:24:22,628 --> 01:24:25,128
(tense music)

1889
01:24:27,272 --> 01:24:28,575
- James, what are you doing?

1890
01:24:28,575 --> 01:24:29,908
- Going to Jess.

1891
01:24:31,570 --> 01:24:33,070
- What's he doing?

1892
01:24:35,263 --> 01:24:36,513
- [James] Jess.

1893
01:24:39,503 --> 01:24:40,753
- I'm so sorry.

1894
01:24:42,302 --> 01:24:44,552
- It's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

1895
01:24:49,930 --> 01:24:50,906
- You come over here with us.

1896
01:24:50,906 --> 01:24:52,186
I think you'll be safer.

1897
01:24:52,186 --> 01:24:53,807
- No, take Austin.

1898
01:24:53,807 --> 01:24:54,667
He'll be better with you.

1899
01:24:54,667 --> 01:24:55,875
I'm gonna be fine.

1900
01:24:55,875 --> 01:24:58,375
- Listen, we want both of you.

1901
01:25:00,621 --> 01:25:01,454
- Okay.

1902
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:13,457
Mom, I'm so sorry.

1903
01:25:13,457 --> 01:25:16,124
- It's okay sweety, we love you.

1904
01:25:23,014 --> 01:25:25,873
- What's going on with you, man?

1905
01:25:25,873 --> 01:25:27,777
- What's going on?

1906
01:25:27,777 --> 01:25:29,035
I don't know if you've
been paying attention

1907
01:25:29,035 --> 01:25:31,793
but my friend just shot somebody.

1908
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:34,294
There's a dead body laying
over there on the floor

1909
01:25:34,294 --> 01:25:36,150
and we can't find his little brother.

1910
01:25:36,150 --> 01:25:38,955
What's not going on right now?

1911
01:25:38,955 --> 01:25:41,172
- Didn't ask about all that, man.

1912
01:25:41,172 --> 01:25:42,817
I'm asking about you.

1913
01:25:42,817 --> 01:25:45,713
How did you get mixed up in all this?

1914
01:25:45,713 --> 01:25:46,833
- You wouldn't understand.

1915
01:25:46,833 --> 01:25:47,666
- Try me.

1916
01:25:50,532 --> 01:25:52,782
- You ever lost a son, hmm?

1917
01:25:53,995 --> 01:25:55,013
I didn't think so.

1918
01:25:55,013 --> 01:25:56,497
- Lost a son?

1919
01:25:56,497 --> 01:25:57,830
I lost a family.

1920
01:25:58,753 --> 01:26:01,003
I lost two kids and a wife.

1921
01:26:03,595 --> 01:26:06,357
So tell me, what's going on with you, man?

1922
01:26:06,357 --> 01:26:07,851
- [Jess] Can you hide for mommy?

1923
01:26:07,851 --> 01:26:09,835
Can you get down there?

1924
01:26:09,835 --> 01:26:12,002
Oh you're such a good boy.

1925
01:26:12,928 --> 01:26:14,112
- [James] Is this your boyfriend?

1926
01:26:14,112 --> 01:26:14,945
- No dad.

1927
01:26:16,789 --> 01:26:19,707
It just got out of hand, everything.

1928
01:26:19,707 --> 01:26:20,693
- [James] Why are they doing this?

1929
01:26:20,693 --> 01:26:21,910
(tense music)

1930
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:24,910
- Hey I thought I said stop talking.

1931
01:26:25,952 --> 01:26:26,785
Y'all think I'm playing?

1932
01:26:26,785 --> 01:26:29,668
Y'all think this is some sort of game?

1933
01:26:29,668 --> 01:26:32,068
- Hey, please, let the
women and children go.

1934
01:26:32,068 --> 01:26:35,401
- Nobody's going anywhere, stop talking.

1935
01:26:40,165 --> 01:26:40,998
- Dylan!

1936
01:26:43,387 --> 01:26:44,220
Dylan!

1937
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:51,618
Where are you!?

1938
01:26:54,144 --> 01:26:56,224
- Hey, anybody in here?

1939
01:26:56,224 --> 01:26:57,057
Hey.

1940
01:26:59,408 --> 01:27:01,764
- You people brought this upon yourselves.

1941
01:27:01,764 --> 01:27:04,509
I mean if your God is so in
control then where is he?

1942
01:27:04,509 --> 01:27:06,420
- He's still here.

1943
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:08,857
- He's here, really?

1944
01:27:08,857 --> 01:27:10,857
Okay, well let's have a little test.

1945
01:27:10,857 --> 01:27:13,358
Pray to your God that he
takes this gun out of my hand.

1946
01:27:13,358 --> 01:27:14,957
Come on, let's see it.

1947
01:27:14,957 --> 01:27:16,297
Where you at, God?

1948
01:27:16,297 --> 01:27:17,561
I'm right here.

1949
01:27:17,561 --> 01:27:19,728
Come on, bring some wrath!

1950
01:27:22,158 --> 01:27:23,657
You're so delusional you can't see

1951
01:27:23,657 --> 01:27:25,780
what's right in front of your face.

1952
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:27,437
You know what I think,

1953
01:27:27,437 --> 01:27:29,770
I think your God's a coward.

1954
01:27:41,481 --> 01:27:42,314
- Dylan!

1955
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:13,780
I can't do this anymore.

1956
01:28:16,398 --> 01:28:17,231
- You want to know the best thing

1957
01:28:17,231 --> 01:28:19,018
that has happened to me?

1958
01:28:19,018 --> 01:28:20,185
- What's that?

1959
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:25,140
- Is when I was in that
exact same spot you are.

1960
01:28:26,799 --> 01:28:30,216
- How can feeling like
you're flat on your back

1961
01:28:30,216 --> 01:28:32,299
possibly be a good thing?

1962
01:28:33,176 --> 01:28:34,900
- It was the moment that I quit

1963
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:38,376
trusting in myself and what I could do.

1964
01:28:38,376 --> 01:28:40,536
- What are you talking about?

1965
01:28:40,536 --> 01:28:42,696
- You came in here broken

1966
01:28:42,696 --> 01:28:45,300
thinking your son was the fix.

1967
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:48,296
And I'm telling you you
could leave here today

1968
01:28:48,296 --> 01:28:51,629
with your son and you'd still be broken.

1969
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:54,714
God knows you're broken

1970
01:28:54,714 --> 01:28:58,131
and he gave the only fix, his son, Jesus.

1971
01:29:02,996 --> 01:29:05,579
- I've heard that stuff before.

1972
01:29:09,556 --> 01:29:12,889
- If you've heard it and you believe it,

1973
01:29:15,316 --> 01:29:16,733
then talk to him.

1974
01:29:20,276 --> 01:29:21,109
Tell him.

1975
01:29:22,596 --> 01:29:24,580
Talk to Jesus, I'm gonna go down,

1976
01:29:24,580 --> 01:29:26,479
check these last two rooms,

1977
01:29:26,479 --> 01:29:28,229
you catch up with me.

1978
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:35,514
(tense music)

1979
01:29:35,514 --> 01:29:36,559
- James!

1980
01:29:36,559 --> 01:29:38,340
We've got to do something.

1981
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:40,239
We can't just sit here.

1982
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:41,476
We've gotta make a plan.

1983
01:29:41,476 --> 01:29:43,016
- Dad, stop.

1984
01:29:43,016 --> 01:29:44,553
They're gonna hear you.

1985
01:29:44,553 --> 01:29:46,036
- It's gonna be okay.

1986
01:29:46,036 --> 01:29:47,255
- [Shawna] I don't wanna die today!

1987
01:29:47,255 --> 01:29:48,088
- [Karl] You're not gonna die.

1988
01:29:48,088 --> 01:29:50,588
I'm not gonna let that happen.

1989
01:30:04,676 --> 01:30:06,260
- You good?

1990
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:07,093
- Yeah.

1991
01:30:09,076 --> 01:30:10,144
- I don't know man.

1992
01:30:10,144 --> 01:30:12,513
I don't think dude is in this building.

1993
01:30:12,513 --> 01:30:13,837
- I don't think so either

1994
01:30:13,837 --> 01:30:16,361
but you know Bo ain't gonna believe that.

1995
01:30:16,361 --> 01:30:17,528
- Yeah I know.

1996
01:30:20,041 --> 01:30:21,458
- Who's talking?!

1997
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:29,359
Lady, you don't know
how to shut up, do you?

1998
01:30:29,359 --> 01:30:31,620
You talking to God?

1999
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:33,560
- I'm praying.

2000
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:35,480
And I'm praying for you.

2001
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:38,813
- Does it look like I want your prayers?

2002
01:30:39,739 --> 01:30:40,738
- Let me tell you.

2003
01:30:40,738 --> 01:30:44,759
God is in control in this room, not you.

2004
01:30:44,759 --> 01:30:46,963
I'm not afraid of you

2005
01:30:46,963 --> 01:30:49,159
and I'm not afraid of dying.

2006
01:30:49,159 --> 01:30:50,339
- [Bo] Let's see about that.

2007
01:30:50,339 --> 01:30:51,215
Hey!
- She didn't mean any harm!

2008
01:30:51,215 --> 01:30:52,048
- No, Bo.

2009
01:30:54,152 --> 01:30:55,152
- Face down.

2010
01:30:57,012 --> 01:30:59,050
All right, who's it gonna be?

2011
01:30:59,050 --> 01:31:00,330
Who's gonna be the next hero?

2012
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:01,163
- Bo, you need to stop.

2013
01:31:01,163 --> 01:31:02,413
This is enough.

2014
01:31:03,690 --> 01:31:05,530
- So now you wanna speak up?

2015
01:31:05,530 --> 01:31:07,893
You wanna tell everybody
about how this was your idea?

2016
01:31:07,893 --> 01:31:10,170
How we're here because of you?

2017
01:31:10,170 --> 01:31:11,003
- Young man!

2018
01:31:11,003 --> 01:31:11,836
(bashing)

2019
01:31:11,836 --> 01:31:13,891
(everyone gasping)

2020
01:31:13,891 --> 01:31:14,799
- What was that?

2021
01:31:14,799 --> 01:31:15,966
- [Andrew] Go!

2022
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:21,187
- Y'all can thank Jess for that.

2023
01:31:23,217 --> 01:31:24,214
- [Cadon] What was that?

2024
01:31:24,214 --> 01:31:25,047
- Where is he?!

2025
01:31:25,047 --> 01:31:25,880
- I don't know!

2026
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:26,713
I looked at all the rooms!

2027
01:31:26,713 --> 01:31:27,546
I can't find him!

2028
01:31:27,546 --> 01:31:28,485
- Are you kidding me?

2029
01:31:28,485 --> 01:31:29,781
He's in here!

2030
01:31:29,781 --> 01:31:30,614
Where else would he be, Cadon?!

2031
01:31:30,614 --> 01:31:32,137
- Hold on, hold on,
hold on, wait a minute.

2032
01:31:32,137 --> 01:31:32,970
- [Old Man] Is she okay?

2033
01:31:32,970 --> 01:31:35,177
- [Nurse] Yes, she's
got a pulse, she's good.

2034
01:31:35,177 --> 01:31:36,825
She's unconscious but she's gonna be okay.

2035
01:31:36,825 --> 01:31:39,186
(mumbling)

2036
01:31:39,186 --> 01:31:41,230
- [Old Man] Lord, is she okay?

2037
01:31:41,230 --> 01:31:43,326
- Hey, there's a crawl
space over the closet.

2038
01:31:43,326 --> 01:31:44,159
We need to check it.

2039
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:45,742
- [Bo] Go check it!

2040
01:31:54,976 --> 01:31:55,809
- Shawna.

2041
01:31:55,809 --> 01:31:59,582
- [Shawna] I really meant
what I said at church camp.

2042
01:31:59,582 --> 01:32:00,415
- I know.

2043
01:32:01,821 --> 01:32:03,923
But what happened?

2044
01:32:03,923 --> 01:32:05,721
- I don't know.

2045
01:32:05,721 --> 01:32:07,961
Life happened, and,

2046
01:32:07,961 --> 01:32:10,044
my life's not like yours.

2047
01:32:10,985 --> 01:32:14,319
I've made mistakes, big mistakes.

2048
01:32:14,319 --> 01:32:16,860
- My life is so far from perfect, Shawna.

2049
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:18,541
We all make mistakes.

2050
01:32:18,541 --> 01:32:21,208
- Yeah but, I really screwed up.

2051
01:32:23,438 --> 01:32:27,763
And I've been so far from
God the past two years

2052
01:32:27,763 --> 01:32:31,640
and now I'm in here
begging him to save me?

2053
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:33,557
- He's still listening.

2054
01:32:40,338 --> 01:32:42,339
- Nah, I really don't think
he would have gone in there.

2055
01:32:42,339 --> 01:32:43,556
- I don't think so either

2056
01:32:43,556 --> 01:32:44,557
but your buddy downstairs,

2057
01:32:44,557 --> 01:32:46,702
we can't let him hurt anybody else.

2058
01:32:46,702 --> 01:32:48,761
- What are we supposed to do?

2059
01:32:48,761 --> 01:32:50,098
- I've been thinking.

2060
01:32:50,098 --> 01:32:52,542
There's two doors to that room downstairs.

2061
01:32:52,542 --> 01:32:53,982
If you can keep him away,

2062
01:32:53,982 --> 01:32:55,358
I can unlock those doors

2063
01:32:55,358 --> 01:32:57,941
and we can get them people out.

2064
01:33:02,573 --> 01:33:04,078
- James.

2065
01:33:04,078 --> 01:33:04,911
- [James] Karl, what are you--

2066
01:33:04,911 --> 01:33:05,793
- We gotta do something, man.

2067
01:33:05,793 --> 01:33:06,626
- No.
- No.

2068
01:33:06,626 --> 01:33:07,959
- You've seen how these things end.

2069
01:33:07,959 --> 01:33:09,017
- [Sherry] No, we keep praying.

2070
01:33:09,017 --> 01:33:10,992
- Praying, really?
- Yes, yes.

2071
01:33:10,992 --> 01:33:13,349
- That's what happened
when you keep praying.

2072
01:33:13,349 --> 01:33:15,827
- Jess, is his gun the only one?

2073
01:33:15,827 --> 01:33:16,927
- It's only Bo.

2074
01:33:16,927 --> 01:33:19,450
Bo's the only one that's doing this.

2075
01:33:19,450 --> 01:33:22,495
Cadon's trying to help, but, I don't know.

2076
01:33:22,495 --> 01:33:25,434
- Where's our so-called janitor at?

2077
01:33:25,434 --> 01:33:26,895
I haven't seen him.

2078
01:33:26,895 --> 01:33:28,234
I bet you he's in on this.

2079
01:33:28,234 --> 01:33:29,311
- I don't believe that.

2080
01:33:29,311 --> 01:33:30,751
- Whatever, James.

2081
01:33:30,751 --> 01:33:32,634
I wanna protect my family.

2082
01:33:32,634 --> 01:33:33,477
Come here.

2083
01:33:33,477 --> 01:33:35,434
- Karl, Karl!
- Karl.

2084
01:33:35,434 --> 01:33:36,437
- Karl.

2085
01:33:36,437 --> 01:33:37,834
Karl, look at me.

2086
01:33:37,834 --> 01:33:39,614
You don't have to do this.

2087
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:40,447
Please.

2088
01:33:40,447 --> 01:33:41,606
- Susan, I can't do this in here.

2089
01:33:41,606 --> 01:33:42,439
- Please stop.

2090
01:33:42,439 --> 01:33:44,496
Karl, please.
- You watch the kids.

2091
01:33:44,496 --> 01:33:45,574
- Karl!

2092
01:33:45,574 --> 01:33:46,657
Please don't.

2093
01:33:47,670 --> 01:33:48,753
Karl, please.

2094
01:33:50,352 --> 01:33:52,852
(tense music)

2095
01:34:16,002 --> 01:34:17,501
- All right, we're good.

2096
01:34:17,501 --> 01:34:18,861
If you can keep him distracted,

2097
01:34:18,861 --> 01:34:21,528
we can start getting people out.

2098
01:34:29,101 --> 01:34:31,601
- Y'all still praying in here?

2099
01:34:33,447 --> 01:34:34,780
Didn't think so.

2100
01:34:38,626 --> 01:34:39,845
(gun firing)

2101
01:34:39,845 --> 01:34:41,069
(groaning)

2102
01:34:41,069 --> 01:34:41,902
- Dad!

2103
01:34:41,902 --> 01:34:43,287
(screaming)

2104
01:34:43,287 --> 01:34:44,660
- Hey, stop!

2105
01:34:44,660 --> 01:34:45,771
Shut up, stop!

2106
01:34:45,771 --> 01:34:46,604
(screaming)

2107
01:34:46,604 --> 01:34:47,437
Get over there!

2108
01:34:47,437 --> 01:34:48,564
- [Karl] Susan, go with the kids!

2109
01:34:48,564 --> 01:34:49,397
- Oh god, no!

2110
01:34:49,397 --> 01:34:50,230
- [Karl] Go back to the kids!

2111
01:34:50,230 --> 01:34:51,395
- Get over there!

2112
01:34:51,395 --> 01:34:53,312
Come on move, let's go!

2113
01:34:55,209 --> 01:34:57,376
(sobbing)

2114
01:34:58,369 --> 01:34:59,202
- Shh.

2115
01:35:00,739 --> 01:35:02,822
- [Cadon] Whoah, hold on!

2116
01:35:06,121 --> 01:35:07,219
- [Andrew] You'll be all right, buddy.

2117
01:35:07,219 --> 01:35:09,097
- This is enough, man!

2118
01:35:09,097 --> 01:35:12,233
- He tried to jump me, self defense.

2119
01:35:12,233 --> 01:35:13,758
Where's my brother at?

2120
01:35:13,758 --> 01:35:15,875
- I have searched every
square inch of this building.

2121
01:35:15,875 --> 01:35:16,878
He's not inside.

2122
01:35:16,878 --> 01:35:18,936
- You're worthless!

2123
01:35:18,936 --> 01:35:20,457
- [Andrew] Just keep pressure on it.

2124
01:35:20,457 --> 01:35:21,934
- You wanna do something?

2125
01:35:21,934 --> 01:35:23,001
You take care of him!

2126
01:35:23,001 --> 01:35:24,121
- Why don't you open your mouth again,

2127
01:35:24,121 --> 01:35:25,516
see what else happens.

2128
01:35:25,516 --> 01:35:28,078
- Hey man, you don't wanna do this.

2129
01:35:28,078 --> 01:35:30,078
You don't wanna do this.

2130
01:35:31,358 --> 01:35:32,915
Please, come on man.

2131
01:35:32,915 --> 01:35:34,553
We know it was self-defense.

2132
01:35:34,553 --> 01:35:36,803
We know it, it's all right.

2133
01:35:43,639 --> 01:35:46,702
- Look, that door behind
you is open, okay?

2134
01:35:46,702 --> 01:35:49,033
I want you to take these people
and get them out of here.

2135
01:35:49,033 --> 01:35:50,281
Don't worry about nothing.

2136
01:35:50,281 --> 01:35:51,114
I'm gonna take care of it, okay?

2137
01:35:51,114 --> 01:35:53,281
I love you, Jess.
- Cadon.

2138
01:35:59,662 --> 01:36:00,662
We gotta go.

2139
01:36:02,542 --> 01:36:05,195
- [Cadon] Bo, give me the gun.

2140
01:36:05,195 --> 01:36:06,218
- Just get out of here.

2141
01:36:06,218 --> 01:36:07,615
- I'm not gonna leave you here.

2142
01:36:07,615 --> 01:36:08,893
- Let me watch these
people for a little while.

2143
01:36:08,893 --> 01:36:11,747
You go look for your brother.

2144
01:36:11,747 --> 01:36:13,247
- Get him, Austin.

2145
01:36:15,283 --> 01:36:16,116
- Hurry.

2146
01:36:27,805 --> 01:36:30,305
(tense music)

2147
01:36:53,947 --> 01:36:58,614
- I'm sorry sweety, I don't
even know where we're going.

2148
01:37:07,232 --> 01:37:09,732
Do you think I'm a good mommy?

2149
01:37:11,827 --> 01:37:14,327
If you knew, if you only knew.

2150
01:37:16,672 --> 01:37:20,411
You probably think I am but I'm not.

2151
01:37:20,411 --> 01:37:21,494
I'm so sorry.

2152
01:37:33,038 --> 01:37:34,038
- It's okay.

2153
01:37:37,378 --> 01:37:39,795
- I can't let go of anything.

2154
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,139
And I've done so much

2155
01:37:43,139 --> 01:37:47,056
that I know in the back
of my mind is so wrong.

2156
01:37:48,782 --> 01:37:50,738
And I know it.

2157
01:37:50,738 --> 01:37:52,321
And I can't let go.

2158
01:37:54,098 --> 01:37:56,238
How should I expect God to forgive me

2159
01:37:56,238 --> 01:37:58,571
when I can't forgive myself?

2160
01:37:59,458 --> 01:38:03,791
When I can't forgive myself
for what happens to you?

2161
01:38:07,758 --> 01:38:09,758
I'm so tired of running.

2162
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:14,957
- Mama, no.

2163
01:38:28,577 --> 01:38:31,327
(dramatic music)

2164
01:38:33,836 --> 01:38:35,669
- Bo, give me the gun.

2165
01:38:37,618 --> 01:38:39,535
Get your head together.

2166
01:38:42,759 --> 01:38:43,756
- [Bo] You know as well as I do

2167
01:38:43,756 --> 01:38:46,493
that we're stuck here, Cadon.

2168
01:38:46,493 --> 01:38:48,993
This is bigger than Dylan now.

2169
01:38:53,195 --> 01:38:54,224
- [Cadon] Where have you been?

2170
01:38:54,224 --> 01:38:55,640
- What, I got locked in the closet.

2171
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:56,816
What the hell is that?

2172
01:38:56,816 --> 01:38:57,649
He's dead.

2173
01:38:59,632 --> 01:39:03,675
- This is what happens when
you don't stick to the plan!

2174
01:39:03,675 --> 01:39:06,233
- [Dylan] This wasn't in the plan.

2175
01:39:06,233 --> 01:39:07,230
- Look, who cares?

2176
01:39:07,230 --> 01:39:08,393
Dylan's here now.

2177
01:39:08,393 --> 01:39:10,339
We got everything we came for, let's go.

2178
01:39:10,339 --> 01:39:11,756
- We can't leave!

2179
01:39:12,636 --> 01:39:14,739
Maybe you two can but
they've seen my face.

2180
01:39:14,739 --> 01:39:16,796
I'm the one that did this!

2181
01:39:16,796 --> 01:39:20,717
There's no way that I
can just walk out now!

2182
01:39:20,717 --> 01:39:22,537
We have to finish this.

2183
01:39:22,537 --> 01:39:23,564
- There's nothing to finish.

2184
01:39:23,564 --> 01:39:25,531
Cadon and I have been talking.

2185
01:39:25,531 --> 01:39:28,432
You guys could leave, no one will follow.

2186
01:39:28,432 --> 01:39:31,849
And I can get some help for these people.

2187
01:39:33,409 --> 01:39:36,272
- You and Cadon have been talking?

2188
01:39:36,272 --> 01:39:37,551
That's how this is, you're

2189
01:39:37,551 --> 01:39:39,449
- No.
- Going behind my back now?

2190
01:39:39,449 --> 01:39:40,454
- No.

2191
01:39:40,454 --> 01:39:43,037
- [Bo] Then what is it, Cadon?!

2192
01:39:46,731 --> 01:39:50,512
- I was just trying to stick to the plan.

2193
01:39:50,512 --> 01:39:51,526
- You're gonna stick to the plan

2194
01:39:51,526 --> 01:39:54,166
then where is Jess at?

2195
01:39:54,166 --> 01:39:56,491
You think I didn't notice?

2196
01:39:56,491 --> 01:39:58,528
Where's the car at, Cadon?

2197
01:39:58,528 --> 01:39:59,771
How are we supposed to get away,

2198
01:39:59,771 --> 01:40:01,353
did you think about that
in your little plan?

2199
01:40:01,353 --> 01:40:02,518
- [Dylan] Hey Bo, it's
okay, just chill out--

2200
01:40:02,518 --> 01:40:05,274
- Don't tell me to chill out!

2201
01:40:05,274 --> 01:40:07,866
Just let me figure this out.

2202
01:40:07,866 --> 01:40:09,429
- There's nothing to figure out, man.

2203
01:40:09,429 --> 01:40:11,674
You guys can just go.

2204
01:40:11,674 --> 01:40:13,242
- So you're smarter than me?

2205
01:40:13,242 --> 01:40:14,501
Is that how this is?

2206
01:40:14,501 --> 01:40:15,978
- [Andrew] That's not it.

2207
01:40:15,978 --> 01:40:17,141
- You trying to say
you're smarter than me,

2208
01:40:17,141 --> 01:40:17,974
is that what you're saying?

2209
01:40:17,974 --> 01:40:18,807
- [Andrew] Not what I'm saying.

2210
01:40:18,807 --> 01:40:20,922
Not what I'm getting at, man.

2211
01:40:20,922 --> 01:40:22,719
- This is over, man.

2212
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:23,636
We're done.

2213
01:40:29,459 --> 01:40:30,517
I don't even know how to say

2214
01:40:30,517 --> 01:40:33,461
what I'm about to say to you.

2215
01:40:33,461 --> 01:40:35,544
Something happened today.

2216
01:40:36,559 --> 01:40:39,892
I know we never talked about God before.

2217
01:40:41,279 --> 01:40:45,823
But I experienced something
today, man, something big.

2218
01:40:45,823 --> 01:40:47,023
And it's not too late for you

2219
01:40:47,023 --> 01:40:48,773
to experience it too.

2220
01:40:49,759 --> 01:40:52,426
It doesn't have to end this way.

2221
01:40:54,261 --> 01:40:56,511
(laughing)

2222
01:40:58,180 --> 01:40:59,013
- Oh man.

2223
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:02,740
So, you're telling me

2224
01:41:02,740 --> 01:41:05,300
that you're with them now?

2225
01:41:05,300 --> 01:41:08,303
After everything that I've done for you?

2226
01:41:08,303 --> 01:41:10,901
I'm here because of you!

2227
01:41:10,901 --> 01:41:13,317
Did you forget that?!

2228
01:41:13,317 --> 01:41:16,762
All of this was to help you out!

2229
01:41:16,762 --> 01:41:19,162
And now you're with this guy?

2230
01:41:19,162 --> 01:41:19,995
- [Cadon] Don't.

2231
01:41:19,995 --> 01:41:22,075
- Don't tell me what to do.

2232
01:41:22,075 --> 01:41:24,093
Nobody tells me what to do!

2233
01:41:24,093 --> 01:41:26,176
Not you and not your God!

2234
01:41:28,056 --> 01:41:29,757
You know what I'm gonna do?

2235
01:41:29,757 --> 01:41:33,453
I'm gonna kill you and
I'm gonna kill them.

2236
01:41:33,453 --> 01:41:36,738
(tense music)

2237
01:41:36,738 --> 01:41:38,988
(grunting)

2238
01:41:46,157 --> 01:41:48,324
(bashing)

2239
01:42:00,898 --> 01:42:02,076
(gun firing)

2240
01:42:02,076 --> 01:42:04,493
(gun firing)

2241
01:42:06,856 --> 01:42:09,439
(somber music)

2242
01:42:56,553 --> 01:42:59,071
(Andrew groaning)

2243
01:42:59,071 --> 01:42:59,904
- Andrew.

2244
01:43:02,020 --> 01:43:04,687
- Did you get what you came for?

2245
01:43:07,442 --> 01:43:08,942
- Yeah I think so.

2246
01:43:11,321 --> 01:43:13,488
- Tell my family about it.

2247
01:44:25,892 --> 01:44:29,642
(siren sounding in distance)

2248
01:46:18,978 --> 01:46:23,677
- I wish I had the answer to
why things like this happen

2249
01:46:23,677 --> 01:46:25,427
but honestly I don't.

2250
01:46:29,917 --> 01:46:33,517
But I know that somewhere in this tragedy

2251
01:46:33,517 --> 01:46:35,767
God has made himself known.

2252
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:38,756
I believe that.

2253
01:46:38,756 --> 01:46:42,006
