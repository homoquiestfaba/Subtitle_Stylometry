[horns honking]

4
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,916
- I haven't really thought
about this until recently,

5
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:36,875
and I had this teacher at Yale
named Michael Warner,

6
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:41,000
and I just read his book called  
The Trouble with Normal

7
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:43,541
that's now
about 10 or 11 years old.

8
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:47,458
But he's talking about...

9
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,125
gay marriage,
you know, ten years ago.

10
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:54,958
And now, it's become
an even bigger topic.

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,708
And his argument is, you know,

12
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,458
of course, you know...

13
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,541
we like to think that, you know,
we should have equal rights

14
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,541
for everyone
and this kind of thing,

15
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,000
but one thing that it's doing
that maybe

16
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:11,125
people aren't looking at
is normalizing,

17
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,541
you know, a queer lifestyle

18
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:16,708
that actually
is incredibly valuable.

19
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,041
And then it's also
going to make--

20
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:24,416
if it becomes legal nationally,
what will happen is

21
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,541
then pressure

you're going to be--ev--

you know, you're going to be
expected to get married

27
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,500
just like straight people,

00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,291
and if you're not,
then there's, you know--

29
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:45,833
- There's a fear
that the hunger

30
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,708
and the race for things
like gay marriage

31
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,291
and, like, the assimilation
into straight culture

32
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:55,541
is erasing
all of the radicalness

33
00:02:55,583 --> 00:03:01,541
and the queerness of,
you know, that sort of world.

34
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,375
I like what you're saying,

35
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,541
especially in terms
of what we're creating here,

36
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:10,333
because I think it's--

37
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:14,958
I think it helps
to inform choices.

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
- Hey.

- Nice to meet you.
- How's it going?

00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,208
- Going good. All right.
- Good.

45
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,166
- Hey. Hey.
- Hi.

46
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:32,000
- It's beyond our grasp
for a lot of reasons

47
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:36,625
with, like, time and money
and all of it to actually try

48
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:39,166
and diligently and earnestly
try and re-create this

49
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,416
as if it were, like,
real 40 minutes cut from it

50
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,625
and people would think
that that's really what it was.

51
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,500
So I think even trying
to do that

52
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,125
is just, like,
a wrong way to go.

53
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:50,750
So this is more like
our reimagined idea of it.

54
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,250
So it's a little bit--

55
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:56,500
There's room to be fluid
with your interpretation

56
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,833
of that character.

57
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,958
- Good. Good.
- Yeah. Yeah.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,541
- 'Cause, yeah, the idea
of playing Al Pacino is--

59
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,291
it's, like,
a whole different ballpark

60
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:09,416
than, you know,
playing this role.

61
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,666
- Sure.
- Right?

62
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,416
- Maybe just do
kind of Pacino.

63
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,416
Do you know what I mean?

64
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:14,958
Not SNLPacino,

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,375
but just sort of, like,
"esque," Pacino-esque.

66
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:22,083
- His kind of maybe--
Did you just get a haircut?

67
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,333
- Yeah. For Oz. 
- Nice.

68
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:27,458
- I'm not suggesting that you
need to have sex with anybody,

69
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,458
and I'm not going to ask you
to have sex.

70
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,916
I'm not going to push that.

71
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:34,625
I mean, it's not really
part of my agenda.

72
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:39,125
But I do think that
it's interesting and important

73
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:42,125
on some level to show

74
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:48,083
you have some struggle with...

75
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:51,458
your acceptance of this, and--
- [laughs]

76
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,875
You might as well call cut...
- Can you--

77
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,000
- And put this on the thing,
'cause this is it right now.

78
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,750
- Yeah.
[laughter]

79
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,375
- I don't personally like
this project, personally.

80
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:04,708
It doesn't--I don't--nothing
artistic in it right now.

81
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,708
Maybe it's 'cause of my lack
of understanding of what it is.

82
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,500
Doesn't respond to it.

83
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:14,500
What I do respond to
and always have is his mission.

84
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,625
Like, I like James' mission.

85
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,583
I don't always understand it,
but I like--I like it.

86
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,750
I like what he's doing
even when I don't understand it,

87
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,625
and I'm into supporting it
and being a part of it.

88
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,375
So I guess
what my question is,

89
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:31,333
is this something that we,
as the artists working on it,

90
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:34,708
are going to manipulate
to make a certain point,

91
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,125
or do you just want it
to be what is?

92
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,750
- I want you to basically
cruise the camera.

93
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,166
- Okay.

94
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:50,750
- Just do that
until I tell you to stop.

95
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,166
- I don't know exactly
what you mean by that.

96
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,875
- Like,
without saying anything,

97
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,250
I want you to act
like this is a guy

98
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,958
that you're, like, cruising.
- Okay, okay. [laughs]

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,666
- You can pretend that
he's 2 feet from your face,

100
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,166
or you can pretend
that he's a little bit further

101
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,583
down the road.
- Okay.

102
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:03,833
- Not down the road,
but across the bar.

103
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:07,541
- All right.

104
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,791
- But I want you to look
into the camera.

105
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,083
- Look into the camera.
- Yeah.

106
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,500
- Okay.
- So pretend it's--

107
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,125
he's either right here...
- Gotcha.

108
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,375
- Or he's further away,
but look into the camera.

109
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,625
- Okay.

110
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:35,791
- I've always been
a huge fan of Cruising,

111
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,041
ever since I discovered it
a few years ago.

112
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:41,458
And I try to live
the gay dream,

113
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,791
and I think that the people
in that time period

114
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,625
were just living this gay dream
that was so spectacular,

115
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,750
that I try to live it in my life
as much as possible now,

116
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,583
and when roles
like this come along,

117
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,875
I feel like it's just
the perfect thing.

118
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,208
- I've only gone just back--
just gone back to acting,

119
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,333
and I thought this would be
a cool kind of first credit

120
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:06,250
to get, and also,
it just seems kind of hot.

121
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,625
I hope I get to make out
with Franco.

122
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:08,708
That's--[laughs]

123
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:15,625
- The reason why I want to be
in this project

124
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:19,708
is to explore something

125
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,625
that I'm afraid of.

126
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:26,458
That's the reason why.

127
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,041
- Should be pretty hot.

128
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,166
Yeah, I've never really been
on camera before like this,

129
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:36,708
so I'm a little nervous,

130
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,666
and I imagine
I'll be kind of anxious.

131
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:44,416
But I'm sure everyone's,

132
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,291
like, really comfortable
and nice,

133
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,500
so I'm looking forward to it.

134
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,916
- Well, I'm interested in this
because I'm excited

135
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,625
to work on something
out of the box.

136
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,708
I feel like in this town,
everything is so proper

137
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,416
and the same, and it's cheesy,
and it's usually very boring.

138
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:03,166
So I like things to shock people
and to move them

139
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:06,500
and, you know, something
that's original at least.

140
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,500
And work with you guys--
you and James Franco--

141
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,250
that's really exciting to me,
of course.

142
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,708
- I think that

143
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,625
the atmosphere
on the day of the shoot

144
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,958
is going to be
sexually charged.

145
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,958
I think there's going to be
a lot of tension.

146
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,541
I know that there's a bunch
of straight guys in the cast,

147
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,916
and I don't know
how they're going to react

148
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:30,750
to the vibrating homosexuality

149
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,208
that's going to be
all around them.

150
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,083
But I think
it's going to be awesome.

00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,625
- Thanks, Travis.
- Okay, talk to you later.

173
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:56,333
Bye.
- See you.

174
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,416
- Hi.
- Good morning.

175
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,750
- You're Val.
- Are you Val?

176
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,333
- Hey, I'm Michael.
- I knew it.

177
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:08,625
- Hi, Michael. Val.
- Nice to meet you.

178
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,000
- Hey.
- Hello. Welcome.

179
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,416
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

180
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:15,250
- Doing good.
- Good. Good, good, good.

181
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,083
Get comfortable.
- Okay.

182
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,250
- I'm going to do something
with those guys right there,

183
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,250
and then I'll be around
in a second, okay?

184
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,041
- All right.

185
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:33,666
[sirens wailing
in the distance]

186
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,333
- Jay.
- Val.

187
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,500
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Jay.

188
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:43,458
[airplane flying overhead]

189
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,833
[indistinct chatter]

190
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,041
- So I want you guys
to meet each other.

191
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,583
So this is Master Avery.
This is A.J.

192
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,000
- Hi. A.J.
- Hey, A.J. How are you?

193
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,250
- Nice to meet you.
- And...

194
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,041
- Good.
- I want--

195
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,166
- Oh, sorry.
[laughs]

196
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,208
- So you guys are going to have
a scene together,

197
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,916
like, early on.

198
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,250
You're going to have, like,
a sex scene together.

199
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,666
There will be other people
involved.

200
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,416
- Mm-hmm.
- But I want to film you guys

201
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,625
talking about the negotiating
of what this scene will be.

202
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,416
- Okay.
- I think you both have read

203
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,166
sort of, like, what we have
outlined there right now.

204
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,125
- Yeah.
- But what I--

205
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,750
- Yeah, so you're going
to be sucking somebody off?

206
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,708
- Someone's--
- Sucking you off?

207
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,541
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay, got ya. Okay.

208
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,750
Okay, and then we have
this little play

209
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,000
while someone worships
my boots.

210
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,541
- Yeah.
- All right.

211
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,541
- Kind of negotiate
where your boundaries are,

212
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,541
what you have in mind,
what you're proposing.

213
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,125
But I want you to do something
that's visual.

214
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,833
Like, maybe it's, like,
some sort of, like,

215
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,041
bound-hand visual thing, as
you're describing it to him...

216
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,708
- Uh-huh, Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

217
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,333
- Because it's something
that I want you to repeat

218
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:04,750
when we have you with Val
in a different scene,

219
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,000
like the visual piece.
- Uh-huh, like,

220
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,125
of the negotiating?
- Yeah.

221
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,541
So there's a scene
that's going to be,

222
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,583
technically, in the very end
of the film, where you guys--

223
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,791
You and Val are again
at the bar,

224
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:18,166
and the music's loud, and we
can't hear what you're saying,

225
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,416
but we're going to see
your body language.

226
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,916
- Right.
- And I'm hoping

227
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,041
that there can be body language
that we see here

228
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,125
with you two
that's mirrored with you--

229
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,583
- Like, I use it
every time I negotiate.

230
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,750
- Yes. Exactly.
- Sure, okay.

231
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:42,375
- So one of my coworkers,
her cousin, I guess,

232
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:48,166
is James' assistant, and that's
kind of how this happened.

233
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,583
- That's cool.

234
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm curious
if James is going to be here.

235
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,625
- I'm not sure.

236
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,041
- He's here.
- Oh.

237
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:04,291
- No, I think he's an artist
who really is interested in--

238
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,625
in the nooks and crannies.
- The range of human experience.

239
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:06,875
Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, totally.

240
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,166
- Nice.
- From reading his, like,

241
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,125
HuffPost stuff and--

242
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:14,791
- I suppose people will be--
the gays will be excited

243
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,625
for Franco.
- Titillated.

244
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:17,958
- Yeah.
- Definitely.

245
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,875
- Hopeful.
- Doing a gay porno thing.

246
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,708
- They're probably hoping
he's going to be naked in it.

247
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,541
- Probably, yeah.
- We are, yeah.

248
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,916
Speak for me too.
both: Yeah.

249
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,500
[laughter]
- I mean, yeah.

250
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,125
Everybody's going to want
to see him naked,

251
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,208
but I think that
there's going to be

252
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,041
a whole segment of our community

253
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:35,041
that is going to be
angrily waving signs

254
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,041
and writing blog posts about,

255
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,458
"Why is this straight dude
touching this?"

256
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,000
- Maybe that's
part of the point, though,

257
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,541
'cause, like,
if you think about

258
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,250
the original production
of Cruising,right?

259
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:49,166
- The ones who would protest
probably are the ones

260
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,041
who have the most kink
inside of them

261
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,916
and are suppressing it
or are afraid

262
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,666
of experiencing
or exploring something

263
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,958
because of their own fear
of being judged.

264
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,500
But anybody who is cozy
with themselves

265
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,416
and all the stuff is probably
going to be cool with it.

266
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,458
- Yeah, I'm curious to see
what's going on with this thing,

267
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,666
just as far as, like, how it's
going to reference Cruising,

268
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,291
'cause I didn't know that
that was the deal,

269
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,250
but clearly,
that's what's going on here.

270
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,500
- When did you find out
about this project?

271
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,375
- About two weeks ago.
It was just, like, an email

272
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:21,083
that went around, 'cause Franco
used to go to Playhouse West,

273
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,500
and he's still involved.
- Right.

274
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:23,875
- So it was just like,
"Yeah, guys,

275
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,916
come out for a gay-bar scene."

276
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,916
- Interesting.

277
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,666
- And they asked me
how far I could go,

278
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,375
and I honestly said, like,
"Everything but sex."

279
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,708
I mean, I don't mind kissing
and, you know--

280
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,666
- Are you gay?
- No.

281
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,625
That's the thing, it's like--
but as an actor,

282
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:41,166
I feel like you--
I don't--

283
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,916
I remember 30 people came,
and they all left the theater,

284
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,791
because they were shocked.
- Really?

285
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,666
- Yeah. I was like,
"I don't get it."

286
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,708
If you're an actor and you
don't want to kiss a guy,

287
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,708
I mean, if that's your limit,
I don't understand.

288
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,500
- So what do you think?
Are you uncomfortable?

289
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,166
- I mean, I'm a little
uncomfortable just 'cause

290
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,333
I don't know exactly,
you know, what I'm doing.

291
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,958
- Mm-hmm.

292
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,750
- But it's cool, I mean,
I'll figure it out, but--

293
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,500
You know, what exactly
am I doing?

294
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:13,958
- It sounds like Al Pacino
was uncomfortable

295
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,083
when he did it.

296
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:22,541
- Did he have a script?
[laughs]

297
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,125
- Fuck scripts.

298
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:29,125
Just go in there and, you know,
just kind of fit in.

299
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,500
Get down with what's going--
[laughs]

300
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,791
- And just try and fit in.
- What's going down?

301
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,833
- I don't know, just--

302
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,875
as if it's, like, a club,
you know?

303
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,750
[laughs]

304
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,791
Right? If you're undercover,
that's the key.

305
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:46,791
- Yeah, yeah.
What--

306
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,291
What am I fitting into?
I'm just--

307
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:52,250
You know, it's a club.
A club.

308
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,166
- Yeah, exactly.
I mean, I think--

309
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:59,708
- I'm having a drink.
I'm having a smoke.

310
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,458
- Yeah. Exactly.

311
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,458
- Checking it out.

312
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,791
- Exactly.

313
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,250
Yeah, I mean,
what is there to fit into?

314
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,500
I don't know.

315
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:13,416
Probably easy. Just fit in.
[laughs]

316
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,625
- All right.

317
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,833
- But you can't get found out.

318
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:23,541
[laughs]
You got to stay undercover.

319
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,208
- Not a belt,
but what would you call this?

320
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:33,208
- Yeah, that's, like, a paddle,
but call it a throng.

321
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,291
Yeah, it's kind of like
inner--inner--

322
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,166
- An in-between thing?
- An in-between kind of thing.

323
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,625
Yeah, I just call it a paddle,
but it's more like a strap.

324
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,750
A leather strap.
- Okay, great.

325
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,833
Basically, we're going to be
in this general area.

326
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,291
It's not--doesn't matter
right now how specific it is.

327
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,833
There's going to be some people
around here.

328
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,208
There's going to be this guy
down here,

329
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,125
and he's going to leave
your cock,

330
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,958
and then he's going
to worship your boots.

331
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,875
I mean, basically,
you're coming over here,

332
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,375
so Val can see you
come over here,

333
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,041
'cause he rebuffed you
when you had a moment with him

334
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,708
just a second ago.
- Okay.

335
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,833
- You're basically going
to submit to what he wants.

336
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,500
- Okay.
- Okay?

337
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:09,750
And the bottom line for me

338
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:14,125
is that we have
something that--

339
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:17,500
I don't know if this is
too extreme of a thing to use,

340
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,458
but it's got to be
something visual

341
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,916
that is, like, hitting him,
like, on his ass--on his--

342
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,750
[Marty Robbins' El Paso]

343
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,791
[music cuts off]

344
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,666
- How are you feeling
about this?

345
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,083
- I'm okay with it.

346
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,125
- Yeah? I mean...
- Yeah.

347
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:36,708
- We're clearly not going to do
anything that's actually hard.

348
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,666
- Yeah, I know. I know.
- Yeah, Yeah. Okay.

349
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,625
- I trust you guys.

350
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,958
- Your name is Val?
- Yeah.

351
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,750
- How did you get involved,
Val?

352
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:19,750
- James Franco asked me

353
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,666
to come do this.

354
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,875
He said that they're doing
this project,

355
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:29,416
and he wants--
they want to reenact--

356
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,041
they're trying to reimagine
the 40 minutes

357
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:34,750
that was cut out of Cruising.  
- Cruising?

358
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:35,750
- Yeah, did you ever see
that movie?

359
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:36,916
- Never.

360
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,000
- It's a movie with Al Pacino,

361
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,541
and William Friedkin
directed it.

362
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,000
- Okay.

363
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,541
- And 40 minutes of the movie
was cut out

364
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,958
'cause the rating board
wouldn't let them keep it.

365
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,583
- Okay.
- So they said

366
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,333
they're reimagining
what that 40 minutes was.

367
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,458
- Okay.
- And would I come--

368
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,416
you know, would I come do it?
- Mm-hmm.

369
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,916
- So that's how I got involved.
- Are you the Pacino character?

370
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,208
Is that a real cigarette?
- Yeah. You want one?

371
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,500
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

372
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:04,583
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

373
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:07,000
- Can you light that for me?

374
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,208
I can't fit a lighter
in my disco pants.

375
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,791
[laughter]

376
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,375
- Do you mind if we smoke
in here, sweetie?

377
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:18,208
- Oh, I don't care.

378
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,500
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

379
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,375
Can I ask you
a personal question?

380
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,750
- Absolutely.

381
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:32,500
- Are you straight?
- I am straight.

382
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:40,833
Funny thing--so this morning
I get a call from Iris, right?

383
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,500
She calls me up, I look
at my phone, it's a 510 number.

384
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:44,958
I'm like,
"Who the hell is this?" Right?

385
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,833
It's, like,
7:00 in the morning, 7:30.

386
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,416
I'm at a girl's house,
okay?

387
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,250
So one second,
I'm at the girl's house

388
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:56,833
and looking at my phone,

389
00:19:56,875 --> 00:20:00,416
get a voice mail telling me
I'm supposed to be here on set,

390
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,041
get my makeup did--done,

391
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:07,125
and I thought
it was pretty strange,

392
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,041
like, the whole--

393
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,041
I don't know.
It was strange.

394
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:14,458
I was coming from this woman's
house, this young woman's house,

395
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,083
coming to get dressed up
as a drag queen.

396
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,875
She had no idea at all,
but--

397
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,083
I thought it was
pretty interesting, though.

398
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:25,833
So, yeah, I am straight,
if that answers your question.

399
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:31,875
- Have you played
a homosexual guy before?

400
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,666
- Never.

401
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,458
- How do you feel about it?

402
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,291
- I feel good.

403
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,083
I feel good.
Do you feel good?

404
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:46,666
- Yeah.

405
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,666
Yeah, you don't know what
you're going to be doing today?

406
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,083
- I know
I'm going to be sporting

407
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,708
a platinum-blonde wig

408
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,416
and rocking some high heels here
in a minute.

409
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:02,000
- Are you comfortable
with physical contact

410
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,958
with, like, other dudes?

411
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,333
- How much physical contact?

412
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,958
- I guess whatever
would be realistic

413
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,083
inside of a gay S&M club.

414
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,500
- I mean, if it happens,
it happens.

415
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,333
- Would you kiss another guy?

416
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,666
- If it was--If it was--
If it was correct,

417
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,583
if it was right in the moment,
yeah.

418
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:25,125
I wouldn't force it, 'cause
then it would look stupid,

419
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:28,250
but if it was right,
I mean, yeah, why not?

420
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:32,958
If it was right, yeah.

421
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,541
- Have you kissed a guy before?
- I haven't.

422
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:39,958
So we're both, like,
virgins to this?

423
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,375
- I guess so, yeah.

424
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,541
I mean, I don't--

425
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:47,375
Yeah, I guess so.

426
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,541
- And you're
the Pacino character?

427
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,958
- Kind of.
I mean, not exactly.

428
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,750
I'm kind of playing
the character

429
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,375
that Pacino was playing
in the original movie.

430
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,166
- Okay.
Are you a Pacino fan?

431
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,416
- He's my favorite actor.

432
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:00,916
- Is he?
- Yeah.

433
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:04,625
- Okay, what's
your favorite Pacino movie?

434
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,125
- Maybe Scarecrow.

435
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,958
- Scarecrow? 
- Yeah.

436
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,958
- I haven't seen that one.
What's the one with him--

437
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,583
I think
my favorite Pacino movie is--

438
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,208
Shoot.

439
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,000
Panic in Needle Park.

440
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,708
- His first one--second one.
- Yeah, I like that one.

441
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,791
I like that one a lot.
That was a good one.

442
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,583
- That's how he got  
The Godfather.

443
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,916
- I did not know that.

444
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:31,208
- Francis Ford Coppola saw
about 12 minutes of dailies...

445
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,875
- Oh, okay.
- From Panic in Needle Park

446
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:34,791
before the movie came out.
- Got it.

447
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,541
- And he watched those dailies,
and he said, "That's the guy

448
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:39,250
I want for Michael."
- What's a daily?

449
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,958
- Close your eye.
- Dailies are, like...

450
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,500
[clears throat]
the day's sh--

451
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:47,583
the results
of that day's shooting,

452
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:51,333
like, just the scenes--
just the shots back-to-back,

453
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,041
unedited,
raw kind of footage

454
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:56,333
of the stuff that was shot
on that workday.

455
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,000
That's a daily.
- Hmm. Okay. I didn't know that.

456
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:00,750
- Collin, throw him back
some of the same questions

457
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:04,833
he asked you, in terms of, like,
you know,

458
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:07,375
you guys talked about being
straight and being on this.

459
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:10,041
One question he asked you was,
has he ever--

460
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,666
"Have you ever played
a gay guy?"

461
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:13,458
- Have you ever played
a gay guy?

462
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,458
- But wait, wait till I'm done
talking, so it's clean.

463
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,708
- Got it.

464
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:22,250
- So just ease into that.
- Okay.

465
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,041
You're telling me about dailies,
which means

466
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,625
you've probably been doing this
a lot longer than I have,

467
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:28,708
so you've probably done
more characters

468
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,166
or more scenes or whatever.

469
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,250
Have you played a gay guy?

470
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:33,666
- Yeah.
- You have?

471
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:36,916
- Just lately.
Yeah, I played Sal Mineo.

472
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:39,875
- Was that tough?

473
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:42,416
- It was tough to play him,
not because he was gay,

474
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:43,875
but just, you know,
to kind of get his--

475
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:45,125
- Mm-hmm.
'Cause it's different

476
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:46,458
from, like, how you are, right?
- Yeah.

477
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,250
- Yeah.
I can imagine.

478
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:55,291
Honestly, I have no idea
why James would want to do this.

479
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,041
I haven't even seen him yet.
I don't even know him.

480
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:01,208
I've only seen him
in films.

481
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,250
How long have you known him?

482
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,666
- 15 years.

483
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,583
- 15 years?
Holy shit.

484
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,041
- We started Playhouse together.

485
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,875
- Oh, awesome.
That's amazing.

486
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:12,916
I've only been at Playhouse
for, like, two months,

487
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:16,125
to be honest with you.

488
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:19,541
- Yeah, I'm not sure exactly why
he wants to make the movie--

489
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,541
why he wants to make this.
- Mm-hmm.

490
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,416
- I have an idea.

491
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:26,916
- What's your idea?

492
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,666
- I think it's about--
- 'Cause I'm really

493
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:31,916
fucking curious,
so please inform me.

494
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:34,708
- I think it's about the right

495
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:39,208
to have the freedom
to express

496
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:44,541
your artistic kind of
aspirations to tell a story

497
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:50,125
or to not have limits
on creativity

498
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:54,166
and that maybe if it's coming
from an artistic place,

499
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:56,083
that nothing should be taboo.

500
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:58,375
- Mm-hmm.

501
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:00,416
- I think--I think--

502
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:05,750
The stuff that they cut out
was people actually having sex.

503
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:08,958
It was--

504
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,250
Gay or straight, I think people
were actually fucking, so--

505
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:14,166
- [laughs]

00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:17,625
murdering each other?

676
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:20,208
- There's sex in fucking movies
everywhere.

677
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,333
- In a certain way.
- Yeah, because you know--

678
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:25,625
- Not--not--
it's--it's fetishized.

679
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:27,916
It's turned into, you know--

680
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:32,166
- Something a little more tame
for people, right?

681
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,166
Something a little more
palatable for--

682
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:36,125
- Well, why don't they
give us violence

683
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:38,958
in a little more palatable way
and amp up the sex?

684
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,166
That's what I say.
- Because people like it.

685
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:44,416
- People like sex!
- Yeah, but they go to--

686
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:45,875
- Everybody's fucking
watching porn.

687
00:37:45,916 --> 00:37:47,541
They just don't want
to talk about it.

688
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:49,791
They just don't want
to talk about it in public.

689
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:52,916
Everybody fucking
watches porn.

690
00:37:52,958 --> 00:37:55,208
There's nothing wrong with it.
People have sex.

691
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,208
What's wrong
with what we just saw?

692
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,750
- It's too much, dude.
- Everybody does it.

693
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:00,166
- It's in bad taste.

694
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:04,458
- Well, we shot it
in a tasteful way.

695
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,375
- I don't care
how you fucking shoot it.

696
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:08,958
- What do you mean?
You just said "bad taste."

697
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,250
- The act itself is in kind of--
It's too much.

698
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:14,916
Like, what about
leaving something

699
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:18,333
to the fucking imagination?
Like--

700
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:20,416
- It's not a porn
for titillation.

701
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:22,750
It's something else.
We're telling a story.

702
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:24,416
- What story are we telling?

703
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:27,208
I don't know what fucking story
we're telling.

704
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:30,000
- About a guy
who's uncomfortable,

705
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,000
goes undercover
into this world.

706
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:35,208
And in the original movie,

707
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:39,000
it was as if he was going
down into a deep, dark place.

708
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:41,250
He was going
into an evil place.

709
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:43,333
That's the way they depicted it,
whether Friedkin

710
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:46,583
intended to or not, by giving it
a backdrop of murder,

711
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:49,333
he was going
into a dark, deep, evil place,

712
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:52,625
and he had to go "undercover"
and be gay undercover.

713
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:54,250
We're doing that.

714
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:57,458
You're playing a guy
who's going undercover,

715
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,875
but to me, he's not going
to a dark, evil place.

716
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:03,250
He's going to
actually a place

717
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:07,041
that's, I think,
beautiful and attractive.

718
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:08,625
- That's beautiful
and attractive?

719
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:12,041
- I think so.

720
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,708
- I got a lot of fucking
respect for you, and I hope,

721
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,291
like, you're being careful.

722
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:18,625
That's all, because--

723
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:20,833
I'm all for, like,
saying what you want to say

724
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:24,333
and doing what you want to do,
but, you know,

725
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:26,833
there's repercussions
at the end of the day.

726
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:28,625
And you're doing
some amazing shit out there,

727
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:32,875
and things like this can,
you know--

728
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:34,708
You're fucking starring
in a Disney movie,

729
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:38,416
for Christ's sake.
- Mm-hmm.

730
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:43,083
- You know, it's hard to have
this conversation with you,

731
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:46,291
because 70% of me
is on your side,

732
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:49,291
because I think the same way
about the things that I believe.

733
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:51,250
I guess I just don't see
what you're seeing,

734
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:53,333
so I'm tripping out
a little bit.

735
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:57,291
That's all, 'cause I don't--
I don't have the insight,

736
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:59,666
or, really,
I don't care to prove

737
00:39:59,708 --> 00:40:00,958
the point that you're making,
so I'm not sure

738
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,583
what the fuck
is really going on.

739
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:05,666
- I don't either.
- Huh?

740
00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:08,000
- I don't know fully
what's going on.

741
00:40:08,041 --> 00:40:09,458
It's about being here.

742
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,166
It's about doing this,

743
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:13,458
experiencing this, just
putting ourselves out there.

744
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,333
That's half of it,
just doing it.

745
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:19,500
And being in a Disney movie
and doing it.

746
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:23,166
That's what's giving it
half of its power.

747
00:40:23,208 --> 00:40:25,166
- Excuse me.

748
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:27,291
- So I think
you're going to have to get up.

749
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:29,750
- Yeah.

750
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:33,208
- So we've got this, we have--

751
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,625
We need another chair,
for sure, right?

752
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:38,625
- We've got this chair
and that chair.

753
00:40:38,666 --> 00:40:41,333
- Okay.

754
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:42,916
Travis.
Oh, there you are.

755
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:45,791
- Yes.

756
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:53,000
[indistinct chatter]

757
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:36,625
- Cut.
Beautiful.

758
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,750
Before we launch into--

759
00:41:45,791 --> 00:41:49,000
[indistinct chatter]

760
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:59,416
[dogs barking]

761
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,416
- Hey, dude.
- Yo.

762
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:05,916
What's going on?

763
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:10,416
- Nothing,
I'm here on--on set.

764
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:14,041
- Uh-huh. And?

765
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:17,833
- And what?
Dicks are out. Balls are out.

766
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:19,708
People are paddling each other
in the ass.

767
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:22,666
There's bruises.
There's fucking welts.

768
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:28,625
Sucking, fucking,
armpits, balls, assholes.

769
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:30,416
Everything's out, dude.

770
00:42:30,458 --> 00:42:32,583
- Man, I got to tell you--
I don't fucking understand this.

771
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:34,166
I don't know why you're there.

772
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:37,666
I don't know
why you're doing this again.

773
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:39,708
- I'm doing it 'cause...

774
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:42,125
fucking James
wants to do this thing.

775
00:42:42,166 --> 00:42:43,916
He's got something to say,
and he needs people

776
00:42:43,958 --> 00:42:47,833
to, you know, help him say it.

777
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:50,541
- He needs people to what?
- He is. He's in it.

778
00:42:50,583 --> 00:42:52,500
He's in it right alongside me.

779
00:42:52,541 --> 00:42:57,666
- Exactly, and he's
a major, major actor.

780
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:59,666
And you aren't.

781
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:02,208
I'm just saying, you've done--
this is the third or fourth time

782
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:06,291
you've been at the forefront
of his expression,

783
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:10,041
and it's always
some fucked-up, radical thing.

784
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:12,666
- Why does my instinct
call me a dick?

785
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:14,875
And if he's got something to say
and he needs my help to say it,

786
00:43:14,916 --> 00:43:16,875
then fuck it, man,
I'm going to help him say it.

787
00:43:16,916 --> 00:43:18,625
- All right,
by that logic, then,

788
00:43:18,666 --> 00:43:20,708
if he wants you to go butt-fuck
one of those guys in there

789
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:23,875
because he wants
to express something

790
00:43:23,916 --> 00:43:25,916
and you're in full support
of that,

791
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:27,625
why don't you go ahead
and do that?

792
00:43:27,666 --> 00:43:29,541
- James thinks it should be
drawn at a certain place.

793
00:43:29,583 --> 00:43:31,333
I think it should be drawn
at a certain place.

794
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,916
Fucking Facebook user
number 3,000,054

795
00:43:33,958 --> 00:43:35,750
thinks it should be drawn
at a certain place.

796
00:43:35,791 --> 00:43:37,625
Who's to say?
It's all subjective, man.

797
00:43:37,666 --> 00:43:39,750
I mean, what's he really fucking
doing at the end of the day?

798
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:43,541
He's expressing what he feels
about sexual freedom.

799
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:45,708
You know, people are--

800
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,708
Quentin Tarantino,
fucking burning theaters down

801
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,125
in his movies and shit.

802
00:43:50,166 --> 00:43:52,166
- There's a reason
why this stuff doesn't play

803
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:54,000
in mainstream theaters--
in any theaters

804
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:57,500
other than pornography theaters.

805
00:43:57,541 --> 00:43:59,750
- It's a pornography set
by my fucking standards,

806
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:01,416
but what's bothering me is--

807
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:03,125
- You're the one that's
in the center of all this thing.

808
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:04,916
You're in the center
of everything.

809
00:44:04,958 --> 00:44:08,041
This whole thing
revolves around you.

810
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:10,000
- He's got my back, dude.
I trust him.

811
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:14,583
- I'm just saying
that at the end of the day,

812
00:44:14,625 --> 00:44:17,583
anyone watching this
will consider it pornography.

813
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:21,291
- Fuck 'em.
- And you will be in it.

814
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,791
- I was thinking
for the scene--

815
00:44:30,833 --> 00:44:33,375
because we've already gotten
you guys at the bar

816
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:35,583
and we've established
that you guys were together

817
00:44:35,625 --> 00:44:37,583
and Master Avery
was at the bar--

818
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:41,375
So I was thinking for this
that it would be basically

819
00:44:41,416 --> 00:44:44,583
as if he brought you
back to his apartment.

820
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:45,583
both: Okay.

821
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:48,375
- And he is kind of instructing

822
00:44:48,416 --> 00:44:51,125
you guys on what to do,
or he's sort of, like,

823
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:53,125
silently watching you guys
as you guys have sex.

824
00:44:53,166 --> 00:44:55,000
- Okay.
- Okay.

825
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:59,625
- But the thing that's
interesting about it to me

826
00:44:59,666 --> 00:45:03,208
is less about actually
what's happening here

827
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:06,250
and the fact that Val
is watching it.

828
00:45:06,291 --> 00:45:08,000
- And all that we need is--

829
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:10,000
'cause we can
shoot this tight too,

830
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:12,500
but all that we need is...
- Is something--

831
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:14,833
- Just something bright
behind it,

832
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:17,041
just right here, so if we get,
like, close on his face,

833
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:18,666
it's not black.

834
00:45:18,708 --> 00:45:20,625
- How about we move this table
with the lamp in there?

835
00:45:20,666 --> 00:45:22,625
- Well, we want--we want--

836
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:25,166
we want, like,
behind him to not be black.

837
00:45:25,208 --> 00:45:27,083
- Yeah, nothing that would
make too much of--

838
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:29,458
- You think this is funny,
you know,

839
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,458
and then he'll laugh,
of course, again,

840
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,458
and then you can be like,
"No, this isn't funny."

841
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,666
And then you can, you know,

you know, here.

843

You shut him up, basically.
You take charge.

844
00:45:39,666 --> 00:45:41,458
You don't want him to laugh.
It's not funny to you.

845
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,000
It is funny to him,
but you're controlling him.

846
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:45,916
And he's going to have to,
like, listen,

847
00:45:45,958 --> 00:45:47,291
or else you're going
to hurt him.

- How do--

849

How do you feel about that?

850

- I don't know, like,
that's just not my--yeah.

851
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,375
- It's sexy,
because you know he wants it.

852
00:45:57,416 --> 00:46:00,458
And that's what's fun,
because you know he wants it,

853
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,916
and you got to play this part
and, like, work it out

854

in your head to be able
to do it, 'cause he wants it.

thinks everything is funny,
but he really wants

857
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,500
to be put in his place,
and he wants to behave.

I wasn't--

I'm trusting

It's going to be smart.
It's going to--

883
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:51,833
Like, I can already see
that it is smart, you know?

884
00:50:51,875 --> 00:50:53,416
- I don't--
like, what was--

885
00:50:53,458 --> 00:50:55,083
Like, what's the point
of it all?

886
00:50:55,125 --> 00:50:56,458
You're, like--

887
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,000
- Ooh.
- Yeah, do you guys even know?

888
00:50:58,041 --> 00:51:00,375
'Cause I really
can't quite figure out--

889
00:51:00,416 --> 00:51:02,791
- I have zero clue. I mean,
I was involved in so little.

890
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:04,333
- You guys were involved
in more.

891
00:51:04,375 --> 00:51:06,375
- You're friends with James,
right? Like--

892
00:51:06,416 --> 00:51:07,458
There's a purpose to it.

893
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,041
- He's got a purpose to it,

894
00:51:09,083 --> 00:51:12,500
even if that purpose is
to quench his own curiosity.

895
00:51:12,541 --> 00:51:14,375
- Yeah.

896
00:51:14,416 --> 00:51:16,375

not the same guy I was when

901
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:26,583
I came in here this morning.
- Sure.

902

- Do you have a girlfriend?
- I'm married.

She's--

906
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:38,041
She's a really cool girl.

907
00:51:38,083 --> 00:51:39,916

that I'm not taking part

in any kind of, like,
sexual things,

909
00:51:42,458 --> 00:51:45,250
but she just
doesn't understand.

910
00:51:45,291 --> 00:51:47,250
She's like,
"Well, I don't understand."

911
00:51:47,291 --> 00:51:49,000
And I found myself
getting frustrated

912
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:50,791
trying to explain it to her.
- Yeah.

913
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:53,875
- Really frustrated,
and it became apparent

914
00:51:53,916 --> 00:51:57,416
that I don't
fucking understand either.

915
00:51:57,458 --> 00:51:58,833

she just wants me

her stress through the phone.

920
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:12,083

this was a good idea

921
00:52:12,125 --> 00:52:16,166
for our relationship
or my career or anything.

922
00:52:16,208 --> 00:52:18,458
Like, she, I think,
is terrified.

923
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:21,541
- You know what? You two were
really sweet together, though.

924
00:52:21,583 --> 00:52:23,458
I mean, you just kind of
were there

925

kind of a supportive way.

It was actually
really, really nice.

928
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,666
But I can see how people
who care about us--

929
00:52:34,708 --> 00:52:37,458
Just the idea--
Maybe that's it, man.

930
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,291
Maybe it's the idea of things
are so much fucking bigger

931
00:52:40,333 --> 00:52:44,541
than they actually are
when you see them and do them.
