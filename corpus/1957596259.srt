00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:26,625
[techno music]

00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:34,583
â™ª

3
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:27,750
[horns honking]

4
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,916
- I haven't really thought
about this until recently,

5
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:36,875
and I had this teacher at Yale
named Michael Warner,

6
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:41,000
and I just read his book called  
The Trouble with Normal

7
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:43,541
that's now
about 10 or 11 years old.

8
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:47,458
But he's talking about...

9
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,125
gay marriage,
you know, ten years ago.

10
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:54,958
And now, it's become
an even bigger topic.

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,708
And his argument is, you know,

12
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,458
of course, you know...

13
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,541
we like to think that, you know,
we should have equal rights

14
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,541
for everyone
and this kind of thing,

15
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,000
but one thing that it's doing
that maybe

16
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:11,125
people aren't looking at
is normalizing,

17
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,541
you know, a queer lifestyle

18
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:16,708
that actually
is incredibly valuable.

19
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,041
And then it's also
going to make--

20
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:24,416
if it becomes legal nationally,
what will happen is

21
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,541
then pressure
will be put on anybody

22
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:31,208
that's, you know,
living a gay lifestyle

23
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,666
to get married.

24
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,041
Like, okay, we granted it.

25
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:37,500
Now everyb--
you're going to be--ev--

26
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:38,875
you know, you're going to be
expected to get married

27
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,500
just like straight people,

28
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,291
and if you're not,
then there's, you know--

29
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:45,833
- There's a fear
that the hunger

30
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,708
and the race for things
like gay marriage

31
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,291
and, like, the assimilation
into straight culture

32
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:55,541
is erasing
all of the radicalness

33
00:02:55,583 --> 00:03:01,541
and the queerness of,
you know, that sort of world.

34
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,375
I like what you're saying,

35
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,541
especially in terms
of what we're creating here,

36
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:10,333
because I think it's--

37
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:14,958
I think it helps
to inform choices.

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
- Hey.

39
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,458
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

40
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,750
You know everyone.

41
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,041
- Hi, everyone.
- Hey. Travis.

42
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,500
- Hi, Travis.
- Nice to meet you.

43
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:23,750
- Nice to meet you.
- How's it going?

44
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,208
- Going good. All right.
- Good.

45
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,166
- Hey. Hey.
- Hi.

46
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:32,000
- It's beyond our grasp
for a lot of reasons

47
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:36,625
with, like, time and money
and all of it to actually try

48
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:39,166
and diligently and earnestly
try and re-create this

49
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,416
as if it were, like,
real 40 minutes cut from it

50
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,625
and people would think
that that's really what it was.

51
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,500
So I think even trying
to do that

52
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,125
is just, like,
a wrong way to go.

53
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:50,750
So this is more like
our reimagined idea of it.

54
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,250
So it's a little bit--

55
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:56,500
There's room to be fluid
with your interpretation

56
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,833
of that character.

57
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,958
- Good. Good.
- Yeah. Yeah.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,541
- 'Cause, yeah, the idea
of playing Al Pacino is--

59
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,291
it's, like,
a whole different ballpark

60
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:09,416
than, you know,
playing this role.

61
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,666
- Sure.
- Right?

62
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,416
- Maybe just do
kind of Pacino.

63
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,416
Do you know what I mean?

64
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:14,958
Not SNLPacino,

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,375
but just sort of, like,
"esque," Pacino-esque.

66
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:22,083
- His kind of maybe--
Did you just get a haircut?

67
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,333
- Yeah. For Oz. 
- Nice.

68
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:27,458
- I'm not suggesting that you
need to have sex with anybody,

69
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,458
and I'm not going to ask you
to have sex.

70
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,916
I'm not going to push that.

71
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:34,625
I mean, it's not really
part of my agenda.

72
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:39,125
But I do think that
it's interesting and important

73
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:42,125
on some level to show

74
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:48,083
you have some struggle with...

75
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:51,458
your acceptance of this, and--
- [laughs]

76
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,875
You might as well call cut...
- Can you--

77
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,000
- And put this on the thing,
'cause this is it right now.

78
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,750
- Yeah.
[laughter]

79
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,375
- I don't personally like
this project, personally.

80
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:04,708
It doesn't--I don't--nothing
artistic in it right now.

81
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,708
Maybe it's 'cause of my lack
of understanding of what it is.

82
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,500
Doesn't respond to it.

83
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:14,500
What I do respond to
and always have is his mission.

84
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,625
Like, I like James' mission.

85
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,583
I don't always understand it,
but I like--I like it.

86
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,750
I like what he's doing
even when I don't understand it,

87
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,625
and I'm into supporting it
and being a part of it.

88
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,375
So I guess
what my question is,

89
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:31,333
is this something that we,
as the artists working on it,

90
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:34,708
are going to manipulate
to make a certain point,

91
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,125
or do you just want it
to be what is?

92
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,750
- I want you to basically
cruise the camera.

93
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,166
- Okay.

94
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:50,750
- Just do that
until I tell you to stop.

95
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,166
- I don't know exactly
what you mean by that.

96
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,875
- Like,
without saying anything,

97
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,250
I want you to act
like this is a guy

98
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,958
that you're, like, cruising.
- Okay, okay. [laughs]

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,666
- You can pretend that
he's 2 feet from your face,

100
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,166
or you can pretend
that he's a little bit further

101
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,583
down the road.
- Okay.

102
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:03,833
- Not down the road,
but across the bar.

103
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:07,541
- All right.

104
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,791
- But I want you to look
into the camera.

105
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,083
- Look into the camera.
- Yeah.

106
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,500
- Okay.
- So pretend it's--

107
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,125
he's either right here...
- Gotcha.

108
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,375
- Or he's further away,
but look into the camera.

109
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,625
- Okay.

110
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:35,791
- I've always been
a huge fan of Cruising,

111
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,041
ever since I discovered it
a few years ago.

112
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:41,458
And I try to live
the gay dream,

113
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,791
and I think that the people
in that time period

114
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,625
were just living this gay dream
that was so spectacular,

115
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,750
that I try to live it in my life
as much as possible now,

116
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,583
and when roles
like this come along,

117
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,875
I feel like it's just
the perfect thing.

118
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,208
- I've only gone just back--
just gone back to acting,

119
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,333
and I thought this would be
a cool kind of first credit

120
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:06,250
to get, and also,
it just seems kind of hot.

121
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,625
I hope I get to make out
with Franco.

122
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:08,708
That's--[laughs]

123
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:15,625
- The reason why I want to be
in this project

124
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:19,708
is to explore something

125
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,625
that I'm afraid of.

126
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:26,458
That's the reason why.

127
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,041
- Should be pretty hot.

128
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,166
Yeah, I've never really been
on camera before like this,

129
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:36,708
so I'm a little nervous,

130
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,666
and I imagine
I'll be kind of anxious.

131
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:44,416
But I'm sure everyone's,

132
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,291
like, really comfortable
and nice,

133
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,500
so I'm looking forward to it.

134
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,916
- Well, I'm interested in this
because I'm excited

135
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,625
to work on something
out of the box.

136
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,708
I feel like in this town,
everything is so proper

137
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,416
and the same, and it's cheesy,
and it's usually very boring.

138
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:03,166
So I like things to shock people
and to move them

139
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:06,500
and, you know, something
that's original at least.

140
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,500
And work with you guys--
you and James Franco--

141
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,250
that's really exciting to me,
of course.

142
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,708
- I think that

143
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,625
the atmosphere
on the day of the shoot

144
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,958
is going to be
sexually charged.

145
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,958
I think there's going to be
a lot of tension.

146
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,541
I know that there's a bunch
of straight guys in the cast,

147
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,916
and I don't know
how they're going to react

148
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:30,750
to the vibrating homosexuality

149
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,208
that's going to be
all around them.

150
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,083
But I think
it's going to be awesome.

151
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:41,750
- â™ª Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

152
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:49,708
â™ª Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

153
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,916
- Hi, baby.

154
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,958
I'm still in bed,

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,208
but I hope you're shaking it
over there.

156
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,291
[groans]

157
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,875
Hey, remember,
don't take it, give it.

158
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,750
[chuckles]

159
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:10,750
Anyways, I want to make sure
you're home by 8:00 tonight

160
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,708
'cause I have
dinner reservations.

161
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,416
All right, love you.

162
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,958
- Yo, what's going on, man?

163
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,875
I know you're at the Franco
faggot project today,

164
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,000
and I got to tell you, man,

165
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,500
I don't know
where your head is on this,

166
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:38,000
and I really think we need
to talk about this right away.

167
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:41,625
Please call me
as soon as you get this.

168
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:45,625
- Awesome. Great.
We're good.

169
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,000
- Cool, man.
- Thanks for taking some time.

170
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,708
I'm going to hand you over
to Iris.

171
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,625
I appreciate it.
That was really awesome.

172
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,625
- Thanks, Travis.
- Okay, talk to you later.

173
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:56,333
Bye.
- See you.

174
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,416
- Hi.
- Good morning.

175
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,750
- You're Val.
- Are you Val?

176
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,333
- Hey, I'm Michael.
- I knew it.

177
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:08,625
- Hi, Michael. Val.
- Nice to meet you.

178
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,000
- Hey.
- Hello. Welcome.

179
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,416
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

180
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:15,250
- Doing good.
- Good. Good, good, good.

181
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,083
Get comfortable.
- Okay.

182
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,250
- I'm going to do something
with those guys right there,

183
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,250
and then I'll be around
in a second, okay?

184
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,041
- All right.

185
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:33,666
[sirens wailing
in the distance]

186
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,333
- Jay.
- Val.

187
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,500
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Jay.

188
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:43,458
[airplane flying overhead]

189
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,833
[indistinct chatter]

190
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,041
- So I want you guys
to meet each other.

191
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,583
So this is Master Avery.
This is A.J.

192
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,000
- Hi. A.J.
- Hey, A.J. How are you?

193
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,250
- Nice to meet you.
- And...

194
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,041
- Good.
- I want--

195
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,166
- Oh, sorry.
[laughs]

196
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,208
- So you guys are going to have
a scene together,

197
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,916
like, early on.

198
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,250
You're going to have, like,
a sex scene together.

199
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,666
There will be other people
involved.

200
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,416
- Mm-hmm.
- But I want to film you guys

201
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,625
talking about the negotiating
of what this scene will be.

202
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,416
- Okay.
- I think you both have read

203
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,166
sort of, like, what we have
outlined there right now.

204
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,125
- Yeah.
- But what I--

205
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,750
- Yeah, so you're going
to be sucking somebody off?

206
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,708
- Someone's--
- Sucking you off?

207
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,541
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay, got ya. Okay.

208
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,750
Okay, and then we have
this little play

209
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,000
while someone worships
my boots.

210
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,541
- Yeah.
- All right.

211
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,541
- Kind of negotiate
where your boundaries are,

212
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,541
what you have in mind,
what you're proposing.

213
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,125
But I want you to do something
that's visual.

214
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,833
Like, maybe it's, like,
some sort of, like,

215
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,041
bound-hand visual thing, as
you're describing it to him...

216
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,708
- Uh-huh, Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

217
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,333
- Because it's something
that I want you to repeat

218
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:04,750
when we have you with Val
in a different scene,

219
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,000
like the visual piece.
- Uh-huh, like,

220
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,125
of the negotiating?
- Yeah.

221
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,541
So there's a scene
that's going to be,

222
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,583
technically, in the very end
of the film, where you guys--

223
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,791
You and Val are again
at the bar,

224
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:18,166
and the music's loud, and we
can't hear what you're saying,

225
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,416
but we're going to see
your body language.

226
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,916
- Right.
- And I'm hoping

227
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,041
that there can be body language
that we see here

228
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,125
with you two
that's mirrored with you--

229
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,583
- Like, I use it
every time I negotiate.

230
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,750
- Yes. Exactly.
- Sure, okay.

231
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:42,375
- So one of my coworkers,
her cousin, I guess,

232
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:48,166
is James' assistant, and that's
kind of how this happened.

233
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,583
- That's cool.

234
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm curious
if James is going to be here.

235
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,625
- I'm not sure.

236
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,041
- He's here.
- Oh.

237
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:04,291
- No, I think he's an artist
who really is interested in--

238
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,625
in the nooks and crannies.
- The range of human experience.

239
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:06,875
Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, totally.

240
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,166
- Nice.
- From reading his, like,

241
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,125
HuffPost stuff and--

242
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:14,791
- I suppose people will be--
the gays will be excited

243
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,625
for Franco.
- Titillated.

244
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:17,958
- Yeah.
- Definitely.

245
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,875
- Hopeful.
- Doing a gay porno thing.

246
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,708
- They're probably hoping
he's going to be naked in it.

247
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,541
- Probably, yeah.
- We are, yeah.

248
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,916
Speak for me too.
both: Yeah.

249
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,500
[laughter]
- I mean, yeah.

250
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,125
Everybody's going to want
to see him naked,

251
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,208
but I think that
there's going to be

252
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,041
a whole segment of our community

253
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:35,041
that is going to be
angrily waving signs

254
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,041
and writing blog posts about,

255
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,458
"Why is this straight dude
touching this?"

256
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,000
- Maybe that's
part of the point, though,

257
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,541
'cause, like,
if you think about

258
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,250
the original production
of Cruising,right?

259
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:49,166
- The ones who would protest
probably are the ones

260
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,041
who have the most kink
inside of them

261
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,916
and are suppressing it
or are afraid

262
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,666
of experiencing
or exploring something

263
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,958
because of their own fear
of being judged.

264
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,500
But anybody who is cozy
with themselves

265
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,416
and all the stuff is probably
going to be cool with it.

266
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,458
- Yeah, I'm curious to see
what's going on with this thing,

267
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,666
just as far as, like, how it's
going to reference Cruising,

268
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,291
'cause I didn't know that
that was the deal,

269
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,250
but clearly,
that's what's going on here.

270
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,500
- When did you find out
about this project?

271
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,375
- About two weeks ago.
It was just, like, an email

272
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:21,083
that went around, 'cause Franco
used to go to Playhouse West,

273
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,500
and he's still involved.
- Right.

274
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:23,875
- So it was just like,
"Yeah, guys,

275
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,916
come out for a gay-bar scene."

276
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,916
- Interesting.

277
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,666
- And they asked me
how far I could go,

278
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,375
and I honestly said, like,
"Everything but sex."

279
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,708
I mean, I don't mind kissing
and, you know--

280
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,666
- Are you gay?
- No.

281
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,625
That's the thing, it's like--
but as an actor,

282
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:41,166
I feel like you--
I don't--

283
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,916
I remember 30 people came,
and they all left the theater,

284
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,791
because they were shocked.
- Really?

285
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,666
- Yeah. I was like,
"I don't get it."

286
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,708
If you're an actor and you
don't want to kiss a guy,

287
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,708
I mean, if that's your limit,
I don't understand.

288
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,500
- So what do you think?
Are you uncomfortable?

289
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,166
- I mean, I'm a little
uncomfortable just 'cause

290
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,333
I don't know exactly,
you know, what I'm doing.

291
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,958
- Mm-hmm.

292
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,750
- But it's cool, I mean,
I'll figure it out, but--

293
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,500
You know, what exactly
am I doing?

294
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:13,958
- It sounds like Al Pacino
was uncomfortable

295
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,083
when he did it.

296
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:22,541
- Did he have a script?
[laughs]

297
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,125
- Fuck scripts.

298
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:29,125
Just go in there and, you know,
just kind of fit in.

299
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,500
Get down with what's going--
[laughs]

300
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,791
- And just try and fit in.
- What's going down?

301
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,833
- I don't know, just--

302
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,875
as if it's, like, a club,
you know?

303
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,750
[laughs]

304
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,791
Right? If you're undercover,
that's the key.

305
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:46,791
- Yeah, yeah.
What--

306
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,291
What am I fitting into?
I'm just--

307
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:52,250
You know, it's a club.
A club.

308
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,166
- Yeah, exactly.
I mean, I think--

309
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:59,708
- I'm having a drink.
I'm having a smoke.

310
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,458
- Yeah. Exactly.

311
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,458
- Checking it out.

312
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,791
- Exactly.

313
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,250
Yeah, I mean,
what is there to fit into?

314
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,500
I don't know.

315
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:13,416
Probably easy. Just fit in.
[laughs]

316
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,625
- All right.

317
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,833
- But you can't get found out.

318
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:23,541
[laughs]
You got to stay undercover.

319
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,208
- Not a belt,
but what would you call this?

320
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:33,208
- Yeah, that's, like, a paddle,
but call it a throng.

321
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,291
Yeah, it's kind of like
inner--inner--

322
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,166
- An in-between thing?
- An in-between kind of thing.

323
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,625
Yeah, I just call it a paddle,
but it's more like a strap.

324
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,750
A leather strap.
- Okay, great.

325
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,833
Basically, we're going to be
in this general area.

326
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,291
It's not--doesn't matter
right now how specific it is.

327
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,833
There's going to be some people
around here.

328
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,208
There's going to be this guy
down here,

329
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,125
and he's going to leave
your cock,

330
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,958
and then he's going
to worship your boots.

331
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,875
I mean, basically,
you're coming over here,

332
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,375
so Val can see you
come over here,

333
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,041
'cause he rebuffed you
when you had a moment with him

334
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,708
just a second ago.
- Okay.

335
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,833
- You're basically going
to submit to what he wants.

336
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,500
- Okay.
- Okay?

337
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:09,750
And the bottom line for me

338
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:14,125
is that we have
something that--

339
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:17,500
I don't know if this is
too extreme of a thing to use,

340
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,458
but it's got to be
something visual

341
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,916
that is, like, hitting him,
like, on his ass--on his--

342
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,750
[Marty Robbins' El Paso]

343
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,791
[music cuts off]

344
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,666
- How are you feeling
about this?

345
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,083
- I'm okay with it.

346
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,125
- Yeah? I mean...
- Yeah.

347
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:36,708
- We're clearly not going to do
anything that's actually hard.

348
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,666
- Yeah, I know. I know.
- Yeah, Yeah. Okay.

349
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,625
- I trust you guys.

350
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,958
- Your name is Val?
- Yeah.

351
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,750
- How did you get involved,
Val?

352
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:19,750
- James Franco asked me

353
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,666
to come do this.

354
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,875
He said that they're doing
this project,

355
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:29,416
and he wants--
they want to reenact--

356
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,041
they're trying to reimagine
the 40 minutes

357
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:34,750
that was cut out of Cruising.  
- Cruising?

358
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:35,750
- Yeah, did you ever see
that movie?

359
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:36,916
- Never.

360
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,000
- It's a movie with Al Pacino,

361
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,541
and William Friedkin
directed it.

362
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,000
- Okay.

363
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,541
- And 40 minutes of the movie
was cut out

364
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,958
'cause the rating board
wouldn't let them keep it.

365
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,583
- Okay.
- So they said

366
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,333
they're reimagining
what that 40 minutes was.

367
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,458
- Okay.
- And would I come--

368
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,416
you know, would I come do it?
- Mm-hmm.

369
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,916
- So that's how I got involved.
- Are you the Pacino character?

370
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,208
Is that a real cigarette?
- Yeah. You want one?

371
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,500
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

372
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:04,583
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

373
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:07,000
- Can you light that for me?

374
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,208
I can't fit a lighter
in my disco pants.

375
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,791
[laughter]

376
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,375
- Do you mind if we smoke
in here, sweetie?

377
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:18,208
- Oh, I don't care.

378
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,500
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

379
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,375
Can I ask you
a personal question?

380
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,750
- Absolutely.

381
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:32,500
- Are you straight?
- I am straight.

382
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:40,833
Funny thing--so this morning
I get a call from Iris, right?

383
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,500
She calls me up, I look
at my phone, it's a 510 number.

384
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:44,958
I'm like,
"Who the hell is this?" Right?

385
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,833
It's, like,
7:00 in the morning, 7:30.

386
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,416
I'm at a girl's house,
okay?

387
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,250
So one second,
I'm at the girl's house

388
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:56,833
and looking at my phone,

389
00:19:56,875 --> 00:20:00,416
get a voice mail telling me
I'm supposed to be here on set,

390
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,041
get my makeup did--done,

391
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:07,125
and I thought
it was pretty strange,

392
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,041
like, the whole--

393
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,041
I don't know.
It was strange.

394
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:14,458
I was coming from this woman's
house, this young woman's house,

395
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,083
coming to get dressed up
as a drag queen.

396
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,875
She had no idea at all,
but--

397
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,083
I thought it was
pretty interesting, though.

398
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:25,833
So, yeah, I am straight,
if that answers your question.

399
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:31,875
- Have you played
a homosexual guy before?

400
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,666
- Never.

401
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,458
- How do you feel about it?

402
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,291
- I feel good.

403
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,083
I feel good.
Do you feel good?

404
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:46,666
- Yeah.

405
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,666
Yeah, you don't know what
you're going to be doing today?

406
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,083
- I know
I'm going to be sporting

407
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,708
a platinum-blonde wig

408
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,416
and rocking some high heels here
in a minute.

409
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:02,000
- Are you comfortable
with physical contact

410
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,958
with, like, other dudes?

411
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,333
- How much physical contact?

412
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,958
- I guess whatever
would be realistic

413
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,083
inside of a gay S&M club.

414
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,500
- I mean, if it happens,
it happens.

415
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,333
- Would you kiss another guy?

416
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,666
- If it was--If it was--
If it was correct,

417
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,583
if it was right in the moment,
yeah.

418
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:25,125
I wouldn't force it, 'cause
then it would look stupid,

419
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:28,250
but if it was right,
I mean, yeah, why not?

420
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:32,958
If it was right, yeah.

421
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,541
- Have you kissed a guy before?
- I haven't.

422
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:39,958
So we're both, like,
virgins to this?

423
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,375
- I guess so, yeah.

424
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,541
I mean, I don't--

425
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:47,375
Yeah, I guess so.

426
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,541
- And you're
the Pacino character?

427
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,958
- Kind of.
I mean, not exactly.

428
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,750
I'm kind of playing
the character

429
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,375
that Pacino was playing
in the original movie.

430
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,166
- Okay.
Are you a Pacino fan?

431
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,416
- He's my favorite actor.

432
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:00,916
- Is he?
- Yeah.

433
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:04,625
- Okay, what's
your favorite Pacino movie?

434
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,125
- Maybe Scarecrow.

435
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,958
- Scarecrow? 
- Yeah.

436
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,958
- I haven't seen that one.
What's the one with him--

437
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,583
I think
my favorite Pacino movie is--

438
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,208
Shoot.

439
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,000
Panic in Needle Park.

440
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,708
- His first one--second one.
- Yeah, I like that one.

441
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,791
I like that one a lot.
That was a good one.

442
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,583
- That's how he got  
The Godfather.

443
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,916
- I did not know that.

444
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:31,208
- Francis Ford Coppola saw
about 12 minutes of dailies...

445
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,875
- Oh, okay.
- From Panic in Needle Park

446
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:34,791
before the movie came out.
- Got it.

447
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,541
- And he watched those dailies,
and he said, "That's the guy

448
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:39,250
I want for Michael."
- What's a daily?

449
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,958
- Close your eye.
- Dailies are, like...

450
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,500
[clears throat]
the day's sh--

451
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:47,583
the results
of that day's shooting,

452
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:51,333
like, just the scenes--
just the shots back-to-back,

453
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,041
unedited,
raw kind of footage

454
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:56,333
of the stuff that was shot
on that workday.

455
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,000
That's a daily.
- Hmm. Okay. I didn't know that.

456
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:00,750
- Collin, throw him back
some of the same questions

457
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:04,833
he asked you, in terms of, like,
you know,

458
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:07,375
you guys talked about being
straight and being on this.

459
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:10,041
One question he asked you was,
has he ever--

460
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,666
"Have you ever played
a gay guy?"

461
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:13,458
- Have you ever played
a gay guy?

462
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,458
- But wait, wait till I'm done
talking, so it's clean.

463
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,708
- Got it.

464
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:22,250
- So just ease into that.
- Okay.

465
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,041
You're telling me about dailies,
which means

466
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,625
you've probably been doing this
a lot longer than I have,

467
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:28,708
so you've probably done
more characters

468
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,166
or more scenes or whatever.

469
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,250
Have you played a gay guy?

470
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:33,666
- Yeah.
- You have?

471
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:36,916
- Just lately.
Yeah, I played Sal Mineo.

472
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:39,875
- Was that tough?

473
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:42,416
- It was tough to play him,
not because he was gay,

474
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:43,875
but just, you know,
to kind of get his--

475
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:45,125
- Mm-hmm.
'Cause it's different

476
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:46,458
from, like, how you are, right?
- Yeah.

477
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,250
- Yeah.
I can imagine.

478
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:55,291
Honestly, I have no idea
why James would want to do this.

479
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,041
I haven't even seen him yet.
I don't even know him.

480
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:01,208
I've only seen him
in films.

481
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,250
How long have you known him?

482
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,666
- 15 years.

483
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,583
- 15 years?
Holy shit.

484
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,041
- We started Playhouse together.

485
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,875
- Oh, awesome.
That's amazing.

486
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:12,916
I've only been at Playhouse
for, like, two months,

487
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:16,125
to be honest with you.

488
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:19,541
- Yeah, I'm not sure exactly why
he wants to make the movie--

489
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,541
why he wants to make this.
- Mm-hmm.

490
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,416
- I have an idea.

491
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:26,916
- What's your idea?

492
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,666
- I think it's about--
- 'Cause I'm really

493
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:31,916
fucking curious,
so please inform me.

494
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:34,708
- I think it's about the right

495
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:39,208
to have the freedom
to express

496
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:44,541
your artistic kind of
aspirations to tell a story

497
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:50,125
or to not have limits
on creativity

498
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:54,166
and that maybe if it's coming
from an artistic place,

499
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:56,083
that nothing should be taboo.

500
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:58,375
- Mm-hmm.

501
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:00,416
- I think--I think--

502
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:05,750
The stuff that they cut out
was people actually having sex.

503
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:08,958
It was--

504
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,250
Gay or straight, I think people
were actually fucking, so--

505
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:14,166
- [laughs]
- You know what I mean?

506
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:16,375
- Are people fucking today?

507
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:18,958
- I don't know.
- You're not.

508
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,208
- No.
- I don't think I am.

509
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,583
- Can you look up for me?
- Yeah.

510
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:25,583
- Would you?
- Probably not.

511
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:27,583
I mean, if you want my honest--
my honest--

512
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:30,041
I could lie and be all like,
"Yeah, I would," but honestly,

513
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:32,625
probably not, no, unless
I was getting paid a hefty sum.

514
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:37,208
Would you fuck for--
without getting paid?

515
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,833
- I wouldn't fuck, period.

516
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:43,416
[indistinct chatter]

517
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:53,000
- We're doing--we're doing--

518
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:55,458
We're doing the wide that's
going to not have Val dancing.

519
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,458
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay.

520
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,708
- So do you know how to do this?
Okay, so basically--

521
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,375
It's basically, like,
you can just be, like--

522
00:26:02,416 --> 00:26:03,833
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

523
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:07,625
- But we need to take
some of this liquid out.

524
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,375
That's fine, I just
don't want him to have, like,

525
00:26:09,416 --> 00:26:10,958
actual water go into his nose.
- Sure, yeah.

526
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
- I just need to get right--
- Fine.

527
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:18,416
- Giving him enough attention,
but not so much that he knows?

528
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:22,458
- Yeah.
That sounds good. Yeah.

529
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,500
Is everybody in here now?

530
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:30,583
Are all of the guys
for the bar scene in here?

531
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:33,541
Okay, so one thing
I want to say is,

532
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:36,708
so much about this
is about the cruising,

533
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,083
the watching, the looking.

534
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:40,958
So it's so much
about your guys' eyes.

535
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,250
So you're always--
You know, unlike 2012,

536
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:44,833
people aren't buried
into their phones

537
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:47,041
or buried, like, in something.
They're, like--

538
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:48,833
You guys are looking around.

539
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:50,458
You're looking for somebody
basically

540
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,458
to have some action with.

541
00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:00,416
[indistinct chatter]

542
00:27:02,541 --> 00:27:05,500
And when you're dancing--
so we want to have--

543
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,291
One of the things we want
are layers,

544
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:09,166
so I want you guys
to not be in a line

545
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:12,208
and some of you to be
on the other side of me.

546
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,125
You're not quite
against the wall.

547
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:16,875
You'll be here dancing.

548
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:28,083
Okay, that's perfect.

549
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:30,750
While that's happening,

550
00:27:30,791 --> 00:27:34,250
you two are looking
at each other.

551
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:37,916
[indistinct chatter]

552
00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:45,750
And then maybe
one more person dancing.

553
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:47,541
Are you in this?

554
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:50,916
Why don't you be back here,

555
00:27:50,958 --> 00:27:52,458
and you know
that you're hot shit,

556
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,000
and you've got, like,
a hot-shit outfit on

557
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:55,833
or a minimal
hot-shit outfit on,

558
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:57,958
and you're kind of--
you're waiting for somebody

559
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,916
to come over and cruise you,
but you're sort of

560
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:03,333
cruising the room to see who's
going to come your direction.

561
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:04,791
- Yeah.
- You can handle that.

562
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:06,750
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

563
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:08,791
- Okay, and then do we want
anyone walking through

564
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:09,791
either way?

565
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:13,000
- Yeah.

566
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:18,541
[indistinct chatter]

567
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:34,041
- I can't see--like, I can't--
Like, I can't--I just can't.

568
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:35,750
My head's too big to see.

569
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:39,583
- It's the other way.
You put it on the wrong way.

570
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:42,958
- It's not working.

571
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,166
- Show him how to do it, Iris.

572
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:47,166
- Yeah, baby.

573
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:50,375
- I can't.
- Yo, come on.

574
00:28:50,416 --> 00:28:52,083
- I literally am,
like, sweating,

575
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:53,333
and like, freaking out.
You want me to do it,

576
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:54,833
I'll do it.
- Yeah, baby.

577
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:56,208
- You really want me to do it?
- Yeah, baby.

578
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,750
- If I faint,
it's on your head.

579
00:28:57,791 --> 00:29:02,375
- Does anyone else need water?
- Yeah.

580
00:29:02,416 --> 00:29:04,208
- He wants me to tell you
it's hard to breathe.

581
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,541
It's a pretty intense mask.
- Really?

582
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:07,083
- Yeah.
- Someone's going to have to be

583
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,375
with him to, like,
make sure he doesn't--

584
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:09,916
- Okay, yeah,
just stay with him,

585
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,791
or whoever Travis wants
with him.

586
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,041
Hey, Travis?

00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:39,916
- Okay, you guys.
Okay, go.

[indistinct chatter]

590
00:29:58,083 --> 00:29:59,833
- I write, like,
short stories and stuff.

591
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:01,333
- Yeah.

592
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:04,291
- What about you?
What do you do?

593
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:06,250
Like, full-time?

594
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:11,708
- Thanks.
[laughter]

595
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,708
Thanks, man.

596
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:21,458
- Okay, uh--
- Stand right there.

597
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,708
- That's a little bit better.

598
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,666
- What temperature is that?

599
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,291
- That's a good color.
- Okay.

600
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:39,208
- Can we roll camera?
- Yep.

601
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:42,333
- Okay, we're going to slate
next to James here real fast.

602
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:45,500
- Stand by, guys!

603
00:30:45,541 --> 00:30:49,291
- Okay.
So sound speed.

604
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:50,750
Roll cameras.

605
00:30:50,791 --> 00:30:53,125
- Rolling.
- Rolling.

- Mmm.

Yeah, boy.

- Yeah, okay, great.

- Break for lunch?
- Yeah, lunchtime.

00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:48,875
- Sweet.
Thanks, everybody.

00:34:48,916 --> 00:34:50,583
[applause]

619
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:59,375
- Would it feel different if it
was a guy and a girl in there?

620
00:34:59,416 --> 00:35:01,291
- Yeah, it wouldn't be--
- Why?

621
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:04,666
- It wouldn't make it okay.
- Why?

622
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:06,166
- Why would it feel different
for me?

623
00:35:06,208 --> 00:35:07,791
- Yeah.
- I guess I'd be

624
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:10,208
a little more used to it,
so it'd feel different,

625
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,000
but I still wouldn't want to be
in a fucking regular porno,

626
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:14,375
gay or fucking not.
- Well, here's how I feel.

627
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:16,958
I don't like the fact
that I feel like

628
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,208
I've been brought up
to think a certain way.

629
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,625
I don't like thinking that.

630
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:23,083
I don't like realizing

631
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:27,875
that my mind has been twisted
by the way that

632
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:29,791
the world has been
set up around me,

633
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:34,500
and what that is, is straight,
normative kind of behavior.

634
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:37,041
And it's fucking instilled
into my brain.

635
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:38,875
And it's--

636
00:35:38,916 --> 00:35:41,333
Yeah, I'd say, you know,
it was a little shocking to me

637
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:45,875
at first when I'm watching that,
but only--

638
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:48,625
I believe, only
because of the world around me,

639
00:35:48,666 --> 00:35:51,916
because every fucking
toilet-paper commercial

640
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:55,833
has a guy--a man and a woman
living in a house together,

641
00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:58,750
and every fucking love story

642
00:35:58,791 --> 00:36:01,708
is a dude that wants to be
with a girl.

643
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,041
And the only way
they're going to end up happy

644
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:06,625
is if they walk off
into the sunset together.

645
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:08,833
I'm fucking sick of that shit,

646
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:12,583
so if there's a way for me
to just break that up

647
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:15,083
in my own mind,
I'm all for it.

648
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:18,416
And that's, I think,
why you want to be an actor

649
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:20,166
and be an artist.

650
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:23,041
- You think that this should be,
like, in movies

651
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:24,625
and people should be able
to see it and--

652
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:26,875
- Yes! Fuck, yes!

653
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:28,958
- But--
- Yes, sex should be a tool,

654
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,458
a storytelling tool, but we're
so fucking scared of it.

655
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,125
Everybody talks about sex,

656
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:35,333
but then don't dare put it
in a movie.

657
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:37,083
It's like, what the fuck?

658
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:39,083
Or you're allowed to talk
about it in certain ways,

659
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:43,083
like fucking locker-room humor
or frat-house kind of humor,

660
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:46,291
but, oh, don't show gay sex.

661
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:48,666
Don't do that.
That's the fucking devil.

662
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:51,666
Show--in previews, show people
getting fucking blown away

663
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:54,500
and killed,
but don't show gay sex.

664
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:56,125
- They do show
fucking gay sex.

665
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:57,791
They show it in,
like, rated-X theaters.

666
00:36:57,833 --> 00:37:00,291
- They sh--yeah!

667
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:02,833
Put it
in the fucking mainstream.

668
00:37:02,875 --> 00:37:04,500
[laughter]
- Why?

669
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:06,500
- To help tell stories!
It's a great fucking tool.

670
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:09,125
It's what--It's who we are.
Everybody has sex.

671
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:11,500
Everybody thinks about sex
all the fucking time.

672
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:13,166
We can't fucking put it
in movies?

673
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:14,875
We can put fucking people
killing each other...

674
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:16,125
- Sex is in the movies.
- Strangling each other,

675
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:17,625
murdering each other?

676
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:20,208
- There's sex in fucking movies
everywhere.

677
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,333
- In a certain way.
- Yeah, because you know--

678
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:25,625
- Not--not--
it's--it's fetishized.

679
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:27,916
It's turned into, you know--

680
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:32,166
- Something a little more tame
for people, right?

681
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,166
Something a little more
palatable for--

682
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:36,125
- Well, why don't they
give us violence

683
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:38,958
in a little more palatable way
and amp up the sex?

684
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,166
That's what I say.
- Because people like it.

685
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:44,416
- People like sex!
- Yeah, but they go to--

686
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:45,875
- Everybody's fucking
watching porn.

687
00:37:45,916 --> 00:37:47,541
They just don't want
to talk about it.

688
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:49,791
They just don't want
to talk about it in public.

689
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:52,916
Everybody fucking
watches porn.

690
00:37:52,958 --> 00:37:55,208
There's nothing wrong with it.
People have sex.

691
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,208
What's wrong
with what we just saw?

692
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,750
- It's too much, dude.
- Everybody does it.

693
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:00,166
- It's in bad taste.

694
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:04,458
- Well, we shot it
in a tasteful way.

695
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,375
- I don't care
how you fucking shoot it.

696
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:08,958
- What do you mean?
You just said "bad taste."

697
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,250
- The act itself is in kind of--
It's too much.

698
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:14,916
Like, what about
leaving something

699
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:18,333
to the fucking imagination?
Like--

700
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:20,416
- It's not a porn
for titillation.

701
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:22,750
It's something else.
We're telling a story.

702
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:24,416
- What story are we telling?

703
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:27,208
I don't know what fucking story
we're telling.

704
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:30,000
- About a guy
who's uncomfortable,

705
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,000
goes undercover
into this world.

706
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:35,208
And in the original movie,

707
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:39,000
it was as if he was going
down into a deep, dark place.

708
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:41,250
He was going
into an evil place.

709
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:43,333
That's the way they depicted it,
whether Friedkin

710
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:46,583
intended to or not, by giving it
a backdrop of murder,

711
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:49,333
he was going
into a dark, deep, evil place,

712
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:52,625
and he had to go "undercover"
and be gay undercover.

713
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:54,250
We're doing that.

714
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:57,458
You're playing a guy
who's going undercover,

715
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,875
but to me, he's not going
to a dark, evil place.

716
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:03,250
He's going to
actually a place

717
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:07,041
that's, I think,
beautiful and attractive.

718
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:08,625
- That's beautiful
and attractive?

719
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:12,041
- I think so.

720
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,708
- I got a lot of fucking
respect for you, and I hope,

721
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,291
like, you're being careful.

722
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:18,625
That's all, because--

723
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:20,833
I'm all for, like,
saying what you want to say

724
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:24,333
and doing what you want to do,
but, you know,

725
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:26,833
there's repercussions
at the end of the day.

726
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:28,625
And you're doing
some amazing shit out there,

727
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:32,875
and things like this can,
you know--

728
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:34,708
You're fucking starring
in a Disney movie,

729
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:38,416
for Christ's sake.
- Mm-hmm.

730
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:43,083
- You know, it's hard to have
this conversation with you,

731
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:46,291
because 70% of me
is on your side,

732
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:49,291
because I think the same way
about the things that I believe.

733
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:51,250
I guess I just don't see
what you're seeing,

734
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:53,333
so I'm tripping out
a little bit.

735
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:57,291
That's all, 'cause I don't--
I don't have the insight,

736
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:59,666
or, really,
I don't care to prove

737
00:39:59,708 --> 00:40:00,958
the point that you're making,
so I'm not sure

738
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,583
what the fuck
is really going on.

739
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:05,666
- I don't either.
- Huh?

740
00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:08,000
- I don't know fully
what's going on.

741
00:40:08,041 --> 00:40:09,458
It's about being here.

742
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,166
It's about doing this,

743
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:13,458
experiencing this, just
putting ourselves out there.

744
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,333
That's half of it,
just doing it.

745
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:19,500
And being in a Disney movie
and doing it.

746
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:23,166
That's what's giving it
half of its power.

747
00:40:23,208 --> 00:40:25,166
- Excuse me.

748
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:27,291
- So I think
you're going to have to get up.

749
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:29,750
- Yeah.

750
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:33,208
- So we've got this, we have--

751
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,625
We need another chair,
for sure, right?

752
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:38,625
- We've got this chair
and that chair.

753
00:40:38,666 --> 00:40:41,333
- Okay.

754
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:42,916
Travis.
Oh, there you are.

755
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:45,791
- Yes.

756
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:53,000
[indistinct chatter]

757
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:36,625
- Cut.
Beautiful.

758
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,750
Before we launch into--

759
00:41:45,791 --> 00:41:49,000
[indistinct chatter]

760
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:59,416
[dogs barking]

761
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,416
- Hey, dude.
- Yo.

762
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:05,916
What's going on?

763
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:10,416
- Nothing,
I'm here on--on set.

764
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:14,041
- Uh-huh. And?

765
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:17,833
- And what?
Dicks are out. Balls are out.

766
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:19,708
People are paddling each other
in the ass.

767
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:22,666
There's bruises.
There's fucking welts.

768
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:28,625
Sucking, fucking,
armpits, balls, assholes.

769
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:30,416
Everything's out, dude.

770
00:42:30,458 --> 00:42:32,583
- Man, I got to tell you--
I don't fucking understand this.

771
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:34,166
I don't know why you're there.

772
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:37,666
I don't know
why you're doing this again.

773
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:39,708
- I'm doing it 'cause...

774
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:42,125
fucking James
wants to do this thing.

775
00:42:42,166 --> 00:42:43,916
He's got something to say,
and he needs people

776
00:42:43,958 --> 00:42:47,833
to, you know, help him say it.

777
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:50,541
- He needs people to what?
- He is. He's in it.

778
00:42:50,583 --> 00:42:52,500
He's in it right alongside me.

779
00:42:52,541 --> 00:42:57,666
- Exactly, and he's
a major, major actor.

780
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:59,666
And you aren't.

781
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:02,208
I'm just saying, you've done--
this is the third or fourth time

782
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:06,291
you've been at the forefront
of his expression,

783
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:10,041
and it's always
some fucked-up, radical thing.

784
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:12,666
- Why does my instinct
call me a dick?

785
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:14,875
And if he's got something to say
and he needs my help to say it,

786
00:43:14,916 --> 00:43:16,875
then fuck it, man,
I'm going to help him say it.

787
00:43:16,916 --> 00:43:18,625
- All right,
by that logic, then,

788
00:43:18,666 --> 00:43:20,708
if he wants you to go butt-fuck
one of those guys in there

789
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:23,875
because he wants
to express something

790
00:43:23,916 --> 00:43:25,916
and you're in full support
of that,

791
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:27,625
why don't you go ahead
and do that?

792
00:43:27,666 --> 00:43:29,541
- James thinks it should be
drawn at a certain place.

793
00:43:29,583 --> 00:43:31,333
I think it should be drawn
at a certain place.

794
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,916
Fucking Facebook user
number 3,000,054

795
00:43:33,958 --> 00:43:35,750
thinks it should be drawn
at a certain place.

796
00:43:35,791 --> 00:43:37,625
Who's to say?
It's all subjective, man.

797
00:43:37,666 --> 00:43:39,750
I mean, what's he really fucking
doing at the end of the day?

798
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:43,541
He's expressing what he feels
about sexual freedom.

799
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:45,708
You know, people are--

800
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,708
Quentin Tarantino,
fucking burning theaters down

801
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,125
in his movies and shit.

802
00:43:50,166 --> 00:43:52,166
- There's a reason
why this stuff doesn't play

803
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:54,000
in mainstream theaters--
in any theaters

804
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:57,500
other than pornography theaters.

805
00:43:57,541 --> 00:43:59,750
- It's a pornography set
by my fucking standards,

806
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:01,416
but what's bothering me is--

807
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:03,125
- You're the one that's
in the center of all this thing.

808
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:04,916
You're in the center
of everything.

809
00:44:04,958 --> 00:44:08,041
This whole thing
revolves around you.

810
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:10,000
- He's got my back, dude.
I trust him.

811
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:14,583
- I'm just saying
that at the end of the day,

812
00:44:14,625 --> 00:44:17,583
anyone watching this
will consider it pornography.

813
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:21,291
- Fuck 'em.
- And you will be in it.

814
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,791
- I was thinking
for the scene--

815
00:44:30,833 --> 00:44:33,375
because we've already gotten
you guys at the bar

816
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:35,583
and we've established
that you guys were together

817
00:44:35,625 --> 00:44:37,583
and Master Avery
was at the bar--

818
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:41,375
So I was thinking for this
that it would be basically

819
00:44:41,416 --> 00:44:44,583
as if he brought you
back to his apartment.

820
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:45,583
both: Okay.

821
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:48,375
- And he is kind of instructing

822
00:44:48,416 --> 00:44:51,125
you guys on what to do,
or he's sort of, like,

823
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:53,125
silently watching you guys
as you guys have sex.

824
00:44:53,166 --> 00:44:55,000
- Okay.
- Okay.

825
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:59,625
- But the thing that's
interesting about it to me

826
00:44:59,666 --> 00:45:03,208
is less about actually
what's happening here

827
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:06,250
and the fact that Val
is watching it.

828
00:45:06,291 --> 00:45:08,000
- And all that we need is--

829
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:10,000
'cause we can
shoot this tight too,

830
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:12,500
but all that we need is...
- Is something--

831
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:14,833
- Just something bright
behind it,

832
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:17,041
just right here, so if we get,
like, close on his face,

833
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:18,666
it's not black.

834
00:45:18,708 --> 00:45:20,625
- How about we move this table
with the lamp in there?

835
00:45:20,666 --> 00:45:22,625
- Well, we want--we want--

836
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:25,166
we want, like,
behind him to not be black.

837
00:45:25,208 --> 00:45:27,083
- Yeah, nothing that would
make too much of--

838
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:29,458
- You think this is funny,
you know,

839
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,458
and then he'll laugh,
of course, again,

840
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,458
and then you can be like,
"No, this isn't funny."

841
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,666
And then you can, you know,
like, give him a little slap

842
00:45:35,708 --> 00:45:37,458
you know, on the face,
you know, here.

843
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,625
You shut him up, basically.
You take charge.

844
00:45:39,666 --> 00:45:41,458
You don't want him to laugh.
It's not funny to you.

845
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,000
It is funny to him,
but you're controlling him.

846
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:45,916
And he's going to have to,
like, listen,

847
00:45:45,958 --> 00:45:47,291
or else you're going
to hurt him.

848
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:49,166
You know--
- How do--

849
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:52,250
How do you feel about that?

850
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,958
- I don't know, like,
that's just not my--yeah.

851
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,375
- It's sexy,
because you know he wants it.

852
00:45:57,416 --> 00:46:00,458
And that's what's fun,
because you know he wants it,

853
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,916
and you got to play this part
and, like, work it out

854
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:06,041
in your head to be able
to do it, 'cause he wants it.

855
00:46:06,083 --> 00:46:08,708
He's a, you know,
laughing little boy here,

856
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:10,958
thinks everything is funny,
but he really wants

857
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,500
to be put in his place,
and he wants to behave.

858
00:46:13,541 --> 00:46:17,208
- My gosh.

859
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,291
- You're missing that ring
there.

860
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:29,833
- Oh, that's what it needs.

862
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:38,708

- Yep.

863
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:41,875
- All right, so roll sound.
- Sound speed.

864
00:46:41,916 --> 00:46:45,958
- Scene--don't really know.
Take one marker.

865
00:47:52,208 --> 00:47:54,583
- You like that?
- Yes, sir.

866
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:58,291
Yes, sir.

867
00:49:49,541 --> 00:49:51,958
- Okay.

868
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,916
- I wasn't, you know--
I wasn't--

869
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:14,708
Like, this is the third--

870
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,625
this will be the third film
I've done, and it will be

871
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:18,916

I spend the entire thing naked.

to do next, but--

878
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:35,166
But seriously, like, I'm--

879
00:50:35,208 --> 00:50:41,166
I'm trusting
that it's going to be

880
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:44,958
tasteful bondage art porn,
you know, like, I--

881
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,583
- Done smartly?
- Yeah.

882
00:50:46,625 --> 00:50:49,583
It's going to be smart.
It's going to--

883
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:51,833
Like, I can already see
that it is smart, you know?

884
00:50:51,875 --> 00:50:53,416
- I don't--
like, what was--

885
00:50:53,458 --> 00:50:55,083
Like, what's the point
of it all?

886
00:50:55,125 --> 00:50:56,458
You're, like--

887
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,000
- Ooh.
- Yeah, do you guys even know?

888
00:50:58,041 --> 00:51:00,375
'Cause I really
can't quite figure out--

889
00:51:00,416 --> 00:51:02,791
- I have zero clue. I mean,
I was involved in so little.

890
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:04,333
- You guys were involved
in more.

891
00:51:04,375 --> 00:51:06,375
- You're friends with James,
right? Like--

892
00:51:06,416 --> 00:51:07,458
There's a purpose to it.

893
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,041
- He's got a purpose to it,

894
00:51:09,083 --> 00:51:12,500
even if that purpose is
to quench his own curiosity.

895
00:51:12,541 --> 00:51:14,375
- Yeah.

896
00:51:14,416 --> 00:51:16,375
- Sometimes you need help
to do that, and here we are.

897
00:51:16,416 --> 00:51:18,208
We're all, you know...
[laughter]

I think I've learned something.

I don't know what it is,

900
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:24,666
but I'm definitely
not the same guy I was when

901
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:26,583
I came in here this morning.
- Sure.

902
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,208
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- I'm married.

903
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:30,750
- You're married?
- Yeah.

- What does your wife think
about all this?

905
00:51:32,041 --> 00:51:35,250
- She's cool, man.
She's--

906
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:38,041
She's a really cool girl.

907
00:51:38,083 --> 00:51:39,916
You know, she knows
that I'm not taking part

908
00:51:39,958 --> 00:51:42,416
in any kind of, like,
sexual things,

909
00:51:42,458 --> 00:51:45,250
but she just
doesn't understand.

910
00:51:45,291 --> 00:51:47,250
She's like,
"Well, I don't understand."

911
00:51:47,291 --> 00:51:49,000
And I found myself
getting frustrated

912
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:50,791
trying to explain it to her.
- Yeah.

913
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:53,875
- Really frustrated,
and it became apparent

914
00:51:53,916 --> 00:51:57,416
that I don't
fucking understand either.

915
00:51:57,458 --> 00:51:58,833
But she was cool,
she just wants me

916
00:51:58,875 --> 00:52:00,750
to make it back in time
to go to dinner tonight.

and I could feel

00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,083
her stress through the phone.

920
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:12,083
Like, she did not think
this was a good idea

921
00:52:12,125 --> 00:52:16,166
for our relationship
or my career or anything.

922
00:52:16,208 --> 00:52:18,458
Like, she, I think,
is terrified.

923
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:21,541
- You know what? You two were
really sweet together, though.

924
00:52:21,583 --> 00:52:23,458
I mean, you just kind of
were there

925
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:27,666
in such a gentle, cool,
kind of a supportive way.

926
00:52:27,708 --> 00:52:29,750
I could tell you're a couple.

927
00:52:29,791 --> 00:52:32,458
It was actually
really, really nice.

928
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,666
But I can see how people
who care about us--

929
00:52:34,708 --> 00:52:37,458
Just the idea--
Maybe that's it, man.

930
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,291
Maybe it's the idea of things
are so much fucking bigger

931
00:52:40,333 --> 00:52:44,541
than they actually are
when you see them and do them.

932
00:52:48,541 --> 00:52:50,583
