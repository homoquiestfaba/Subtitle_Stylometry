1
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:21,523
Yeah?

2
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:25,423
What the fuck
do you care?

3
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:28,430
Yeah, we won by seven,
but it should've been twenty.

4
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:30,932
Where were you?

5
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,969
<i>All right, I'll meet you</i>
<i>in 15 minutes. </i>

6
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,890
You played right into
my game, Professor.

7
00:02:58,962 --> 00:03:01,021
<i>Next week?</i>

8
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,699
<i> Ja, ja, ja. </i>

9
00:03:35,064 --> 00:03:36,998
<i>Even as a little kid... </i>

10
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:40,524
<i>I was always one</i>
<i>to examine things closely. </i>

11
00:03:40,603 --> 00:03:43,538
<i>The world was full of riddles</i>
<i>and mysteries and puzzles,</i>

12
00:03:43,606 --> 00:03:47,235
<i>and I learned early on</i>
<i>that I had a gift for solving them. </i>

13
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,610
<i>I learned that careful examination</i>
<i>of how and what and why... </i>

14
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:55,879
<i>would inevitably lead to understanding,</i>
<i>even to control. </i>

15
00:03:55,952 --> 00:03:59,149
<i>But what I didn't know,</i>
<i>what I never could've imagined,</i>

16
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:03,090
<i>was that one day</i> <i>my own life would
become</i> <i>the most challenging puzzle of all. </i>

17
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,595
Hey, what's an eight-letter word
for "slaughterhouse"?

18
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:13,596
- Abattoir.
- You're good.

19
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,901
How do you spell
your last name again?

20
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:20,272
"N-E-N-O-N-E-N."
Tony Nenonen.

21
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,540
What's it been now nine months, Detective?

22
00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:26,548
- What's a ten-letter word
for your name? - For my name?

23
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:30,552
My name's
got seven letters.

24
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,555
Yeah, but
it's a ten-letter word.

25
00:04:33,623 --> 00:04:35,557
Ten-letter word?

26
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,343
What the hell
is this?

27
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,958
Here's what he looks like
with a face.

28
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,669
" Jay Cho. "

29
00:05:21,871 --> 00:05:23,862
We went to high school
together.

30
00:05:32,815 --> 00:05:35,511
So you knew this guy,
huh?

31
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,519
Was he a friend of yours?

32
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,689
No.

33
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,395
He was real odd.

34
00:05:47,463 --> 00:05:49,397
Was kinda quiet.

35
00:05:49,465 --> 00:05:52,491
Didn't really seem
to have any friends.

36
00:05:52,568 --> 00:05:55,731
One year he tried out
for the basketball team.

37
00:05:55,805 --> 00:05:58,672
<i>What a nightmare. </i>

38
00:05:58,741 --> 00:06:02,177
We tortured the shit out of him
until he quit.

39
00:06:02,245 --> 00:06:04,475
What'd you do to him?

40
00:06:04,547 --> 00:06:07,380
We gave him hell.

41
00:06:11,187 --> 00:06:15,146
Yeah, one time I saw this guy that
had been attacked by a grizzly bear.

42
00:06:15,224 --> 00:06:17,158
Sort of looked
like this.

43
00:06:17,226 --> 00:06:19,160
<i>Somethin'had just</i>
<i>ripped him apart. </i>

44
00:06:20,997 --> 00:06:22,931
You ever go fishing,
Tony?

45
00:06:26,502 --> 00:06:29,938
<i>Sometimes I take the boys</i>
<i>up to the mountains. </i>

46
00:07:35,338 --> 00:07:37,499
<i>What do you got?</i>

47
00:07:39,976 --> 00:07:42,171
It's a child's finger.

48
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:07,301
We got two good prints
off the box.

49
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,806
One belongs to your victim. I'll run the
other one through the computer tomorrow.

50
00:08:10,873 --> 00:08:12,807
- Can't you run 'em tonight?
- No.

51
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,810
'Cause, believe it or not,
I also have a life.

52
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:34,322
- Feeling any better?
- A little.

53
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,324
I took a bath.

54
00:09:36,392 --> 00:09:38,326
And a pill.

55
00:09:40,696 --> 00:09:43,062
Are you home
for the night?

56
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:46,067
Actually,
I, uh, caught a case.

57
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,771
How was your game?

58
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,773
We won.

59
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,307
Get some sleep.
You'll feel better tomorrow.

60
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,486
<i>I believe in loyalty,</i>

61
00:10:06,555 --> 00:10:08,489
<i>fidelity. </i>

62
00:10:08,557 --> 00:10:12,618
<i>I understand the concept. My parents</i>
<i>have been married for 40 years. </i>

63
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,596
<i>But I live</i>
<i>in a different world. </i>

64
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,394
<i>Most marriages fail. </i>

65
00:10:19,468 --> 00:10:21,663
<i>Most men just leave. </i>

66
00:10:21,737 --> 00:10:24,900
<i>I know</i>
<i>that would kill her. </i>

67
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:28,910
<i>But if she doesn't know,</i>
<i>if doing this keeps me coming back,</i>

68
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:32,641
<i>then who's to say what's right</i>
<i>and what's wrong?</i>

69
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:40,612
<i>Oh, God,</i>
<i>these boots hurt. </i>

70
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:48,790
<i>A detective. </i>

71
00:10:49,932 --> 00:10:52,992
I like cops.

72
00:10:55,371 --> 00:10:56,963
You got any gum?

73
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,558
I'll do whatever you want,

74
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:00,568
as many times
as you want it.

75
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:06,867
<i> ¤ Livin'in the best</i>
<i>of all possible worlds ¤</i>

76
00:12:06,942 --> 00:12:17,652
<i> ¤ We're livin'in the best</i>
<i>of all possible worlds ¤</i>

77
00:12:41,977 --> 00:12:45,469
<i> ¤ Livin' ¤</i>

78
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:49,678
<i> ¤ You know we're livin' ¤</i>

79
00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:52,536
Am I dreaming?

80
00:14:57,513 --> 00:14:59,947
<i></i>
<i>Help me!</i>

81
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:57,247
<i></i>
<i>Morning, Detective. </i>

82
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,523
<i>You look like you could</i>
<i>use an autopsy yourself. </i>

83
00:18:01,597 --> 00:18:03,462
You were right
about Jay Cho.

84
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:09,232
The punctures and tears in the flesh were
made by a hook, or hooks, with barbed ends.

85
00:18:09,304 --> 00:18:11,738
But they weren't like
piercings for jewelry.

86
00:18:11,807 --> 00:18:15,743
There was something bigger,
more cutting, like...

87
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:18,746
- Like maybe it was supposed to hurt?
- Bingo.

88
00:18:18,814 --> 00:18:21,749
- What about the child's finger in the candle?
- Oh, that.

89
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:24,251
Well, the print
was burned off completely,

90
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,779
but from the bone growth I'd say the kid
was about six or seven years old.

91
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,791
Was it a boy or a girl?

92
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:34,295
At that age, without D.N.A. Results,
you really can't tell.

93
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,661
<i>One more thing. </i>

94
00:18:36,732 --> 00:18:40,065
From the blood flow and tissue morbidity,
I'm pretty sure when the finger was cut off...

95
00:18:40,135 --> 00:18:42,660
that kid
was still alive.

96
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:52,670
<i> Joe. Joe!</i>

97
00:18:52,748 --> 00:18:56,775
Talk to me. Are you listening to me?
What's the answer?

98
00:18:56,852 --> 00:18:58,786
Ten-letter word
for my name.

99
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:03,852
- You're giving up quicker than usual, Tony.
- Tell me the goddamn word.

100
00:19:04,993 --> 00:19:06,927
Palindrome.

101
00:19:06,995 --> 00:19:09,156
Your name's
a palindrome.

102
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:13,327
Palindrome? What's that, huh?
You makin' fun of me?

103
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,529
Is that somethin' bad?

104
00:19:15,604 --> 00:19:17,538
N- E-N-O-N-E-N.

105
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,632
Spelled the same way
forwards and back.

106
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,645
It's like the phrase, " Madam in Eden,
I'm Adam. " It's a palindrome.

107
00:19:24,713 --> 00:19:28,149
- Ends the same way it begins.
- I get it.

108
00:19:28,217 --> 00:19:32,051
It's like the name Bob.
That's one too, right?

109
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:37,483
Yeah.
That's good, Tony.

110
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,325
Detective Thorne.

111
00:19:42,397 --> 00:19:46,060
<i>Hey, Joe. It's Daphne. </i>

112
00:19:46,134 --> 00:19:48,068
I'm the girl you
were with last night.

113
00:19:48,136 --> 00:19:51,071
- This is my direct line. How did you...
- Please!

114
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:53,073
I'm still at the motel.

115
00:19:53,141 --> 00:19:55,075
Oh, my God.

116
00:19:55,143 --> 00:19:58,078
Oh, God! Please help me!
Please help me!

117
00:19:58,146 --> 00:20:00,080
Okay, listen, wait.
Just slow down.

118
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:28,158
This is un-fucking-believable.

119
00:21:28,236 --> 00:21:30,170
What happened?

120
00:21:32,574 --> 00:21:35,065
I stayed here last night
and...

121
00:21:35,143 --> 00:21:38,078
You and Melanie have a fight again?

122
00:21:39,648 --> 00:21:42,481
It's much worse than that.

123
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:47,846
Check out the bathroom.

124
00:22:20,188 --> 00:22:23,123
What the fuck do you mean,
you stayed here last night?

125
00:22:23,191 --> 00:22:25,125
- Tony...
- Jesus Christ!

126
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:30,364
What the fuck did you do?

127
00:22:35,404 --> 00:22:37,838
I was with that girl
last night.

128
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:43,043
I did coke with her
and I had sex with her,

129
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:46,046
but I have no fucking idea
who did that to her.

130
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:51,518
<i>When I left this morning she was right</i>
<i>on this bed sleeping like a baby. </i>

131
00:22:51,586 --> 00:22:53,713
<i>Look, Tony,</i>
<i>you gotta help me. </i>

132
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,723
<i>If I get connected</i>
<i>with this thing,</i>

133
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,725
everything I have...

134
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,660
my family, ten years
on the job... gone.

135
00:23:00,729 --> 00:23:04,825
Aw, shit, man. Don't do this to me,
Joseph. You know me.

136
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,233
<i>I'm a good cop. I play things</i>
<i>straight down the line. </i>

137
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,396
<i> Jesus!</i>

138
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,600
I got a wife and two kids
of my own.

139
00:23:13,675 --> 00:23:16,735
I know you do, Tony,
and you are a good cop.

140
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,406
But you're also my partner.

141
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,506
<i>Look at me, Tony. </i>

142
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:23,847
Look in my eyes.

143
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,251
You tell me I'm lyin'.

144
00:23:37,265 --> 00:23:40,200
<i>Well, that's it. </i>
<i>That's everything I touched. </i>

145
00:23:42,804 --> 00:23:44,738
Phone it in.

146
00:23:54,716 --> 00:23:56,741
<i>It's Nenonen. </i>

147
00:23:56,818 --> 00:23:58,752
<i>We got a homicide. </i>

148
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:02,278
<i>Sunrise Motel, 39th and Rose. </i>

149
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:03,984
Yeah, white female, 20s.

150
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:07,620
<i>Somebody hung her in the shower</i>
<i>like a piece of meat. </i>

151
00:24:09,097 --> 00:24:11,531
I don't know, you'll

152
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,534
<i>have to ask</i>
<i>Detective Thorne. </i>

153
00:24:15,904 --> 00:24:18,338
<i>Think it was</i>
<i>an anonymous tip. </i>

154
00:24:45,534 --> 00:24:47,468
Let's get the fuck
outta here.

155
00:24:49,704 --> 00:24:52,138
Is that
what I think it is?

156
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:54,471
<i>Yeah. </i>
<i>It's another one. </i>

157
00:24:59,447 --> 00:25:01,506
<i>No stiffness. </i>

158
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,608
This child was still alive.

159
00:25:07,389 --> 00:25:09,323
We gotta find this kid.

160
00:25:20,902 --> 00:25:23,837
You get a match on the print
from that box?

161
00:25:23,905 --> 00:25:27,170
No, Detective, but I'm running the print
from the box right now.

162
00:25:27,242 --> 00:25:29,802
When did you start?

163
00:25:29,878 --> 00:25:34,212
Two hours ago. A.F.I.S. Goes through
50,000 print cards in an hour.

164
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:37,979
<i>We got seven million print cards</i>
<i>in the system. Do the math. </i>

165
00:25:38,053 --> 00:25:40,544
- <i> Change the parameters. </i>
- <i>Based on what?</i>

166
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:45,059
It's a non-suspect ident. I already
limited it to a history of violent crime.

167
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:48,095
Come on, Detective,
let's not waste my time.

168
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:57,332
Your time is not important right now.
You understand me?

169
00:25:58,707 --> 00:26:01,073
What do you want me to do?

170
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,970
Take out
the violent crime parameter.

171
00:26:05,046 --> 00:26:07,173
Leave criminal history
wide open.

172
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:10,946
<i>Go under distinguishing marks. </i>
<i>Select for body alteration. </i>

173
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,921
- What, like tattoos?
- No.

174
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,687
Something with hooks.
Try body piercing.

175
00:26:42,284 --> 00:26:45,481
Sherlock fucking Holmes.

176
00:26:46,588 --> 00:26:49,250
Print the file.

177
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,642
- It's the last door on the left.
- Thank you.

178
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,484
Another happy customer?

179
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:21,147
So she won't be giving head for a while.
What can I do you for?

180
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,156
Let's talk
about the box.

181
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,158
What box?

182
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:28,161
Little gold box
about four inches square.

183
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:31,164
- Jay Cho told me I could find it here.
- He did, huh?

184
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,166
Jay Cho.

185
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,833
You tell Jay Cho
something for me.

186
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:40,341
You tell him the Engineer wants his
money or he wants his property back.

187
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:43,844
You tell Jay Cho the next time
I see him I'm gonna rip his head off.

188
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,348
And he'd still be better off
dealing with me than with the Engineer.

189
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,849
Take it easy, pal.
I'm not Jay.

190
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:53,183
"Take it easy. "
Who the fuck are you?

191
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,188
I'm that guy.

192
00:27:59,861 --> 00:28:02,386
Why don't you tell me
about the Engineer, Leon.

193
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,367
- Leon?
- No way.

194
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,462
Leon, you just
got off parole.

195
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:13,530
<i>And Jay Cho is dead. </i>

196
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:18,409
His body was ripped apart by hooks that
were big enough to snag a great white.

197
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,348
Guess what.
Your fingerprints were on that box.

198
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:25,853
He wanted it.
Jay Cho wanted that goddamn box.

199
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,854
He tried to buy it,

200
00:28:27,922 --> 00:28:30,857
and when he couldn't afford it
the motherfucker stole it off of me.

201
00:28:30,925 --> 00:28:34,258
- He couldn't afford it? Jay Cho had money.
- Not enough.

202
00:28:34,329 --> 00:28:36,422
- Why is the box so expensive?
- I don't know.

203
00:28:36,498 --> 00:28:40,559
- Why did Jay want it so bad?
- I'm just a middle man. I was just taking offers.

204
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:43,570
Holding it for the Engineer?
The box is his, isn't it?

205
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:47,597
Look, man,
you can arrest me,

206
00:28:47,675 --> 00:28:51,907
<i>you can take me downtown,</i> <i>beat the shit
out of me,</i> <i>do whatever the fuck you want,</i>

207
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,939
but there is no way I'm gonna
talk to you about the Engineer.

208
00:28:56,017 --> 00:28:57,780
That's okay, Leon.

209
00:28:57,852 --> 00:29:00,787
I'll find him, whether
you talk to me or not.

210
00:29:02,357 --> 00:29:04,291
Hunt for the Engineer...

211
00:29:05,293 --> 00:29:07,386
and the Engineer
will hunt you.

212
00:29:10,465 --> 00:29:15,732
If you lost this guy's box,
you may be in a world of shit yourself.

213
00:29:15,804 --> 00:29:18,398
Don't forget about me, huh?

214
00:29:18,473 --> 00:29:21,408
Yeah, I'll send you
some candy at Christmas.

215
00:29:36,124 --> 00:29:38,354
What?

216
00:29:40,395 --> 00:29:43,330
So, are you gonna
frisk me or fuck me?

217
00:29:55,477 --> 00:29:58,139
¤ Cold and sweet's
the only way ¤

218
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:02,479
¤ To beat the heat
on a hot summer's day ¤

219
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,485
<i>Yeah! All right, man. </i>
<i>You be cool now. </i>

220
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,487
There's my man.

221
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,422
Hey, hey, hey, man!
How are ya?

222
00:30:10,492 --> 00:30:13,427
What'd you hook 'em up with,
Bernie?

223
00:30:13,495 --> 00:30:17,329
Please. I got scruples. With the young
'uns I only deal in the double dip.

224
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:20,162
<i>Ah, keep that thing</i>
<i>open, Bernie. </i>

225
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,795
I want my birthday present.

226
00:30:24,172 --> 00:30:27,767
Sure got a lot
of fuckin' birthdays.

227
00:30:27,842 --> 00:30:29,776
That's right.

228
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:35,538
So, you, uh, you ever heard
of a hooker named Daphne?

229
00:30:35,617 --> 00:30:37,551
What'd she look like?

230
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:40,019
She's got dark hair,
hot little body.

231
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,023
Works the stroll south of the boulevard.

232
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,025
How young?

233
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:48,529
She's over 18.
Probably a little old for you.

234
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:51,531
Daphne, Cory,
Shauna, Dewanna.

235
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,067
They all kinda
blur together, you know.

236
00:30:54,135 --> 00:30:57,571
<i>But yeah, I think I know who you mean. </i>

237
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:00,574
She's kinda new.
Can't say I've partaken.

238
00:31:00,642 --> 00:31:02,507
Who did she work for?

239
00:31:02,577 --> 00:31:05,512
<i>Oh, come on, man. </i>
<i>I'm out of that business. </i>

240
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,514
<i>Okay, fine. </i>

241
00:31:07,582 --> 00:31:11,848
Maybe I know that she works for this,
um, this guy, Terry somebody.

242
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,354
Connected guy.
Got a lot going on.

243
00:31:14,422 --> 00:31:16,356
Connected how?

244
00:31:16,424 --> 00:31:18,358
<i>He's a connected guy. </i>

245
00:31:20,428 --> 00:31:22,692
Does he work
for the Engineer?

246
00:31:22,764 --> 00:31:26,530
Huh? I don't know
no Engineer.

247
00:31:29,103 --> 00:31:32,368
- Bernie.
- I don't know no Engineer.

248
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,433
What the hell, man!

249
00:31:38,546 --> 00:31:41,982
Stop it!
Joe, why are you treating me like this?

250
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:44,575
What am I,
your whipping boy?

251
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,588
You wanna go downtown,
Bernie? Huh?

252
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:51,090
Impound you van,
explain your daily activities?

253
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:54,617
- You remember the last time.
- Okay, I... Shit! Okay.

254
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:03,293
I want the Engineer, Bernie.
Who is he?

255
00:32:03,371 --> 00:32:06,966
I never met him. I swear to God.
I just heard stories.

256
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,311
<i>This guy Terry,</i>

257
00:32:10,378 --> 00:32:13,643
he used to run women
for the Engineer.

258
00:32:13,715 --> 00:32:18,084
A few years back the Engineer
sends Terry this new girl.

259
00:32:18,152 --> 00:32:21,019
<i>Terry</i>...
<i>poor bastard</i>...

260
00:32:21,089 --> 00:32:24,490
pulls up his pants one day
and finds out he's in love.

261
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,084
<i>Well, they decide</i>
<i>they're gonna get married. </i>

262
00:32:27,161 --> 00:32:29,595
But the Engineer said no.

263
00:32:31,566 --> 00:32:33,500
So Terry
just takes her away.

264
00:32:33,568 --> 00:32:38,267
I mean, they elope. They go hide out
in this cabin up in the hills.

265
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:41,467
<i>They were gonna start this</i>
<i>whole new fucking life together. </i>

266
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,874
Then one day...

267
00:32:43,945 --> 00:32:46,379
Terry came home and...

268
00:32:46,447 --> 00:32:48,472
She was just gone.

269
00:32:51,452 --> 00:32:53,386
Terry went crazy.

270
00:32:53,454 --> 00:32:56,014
He put the word out
on the street.

271
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:59,116
<i>He said, "I'm gonna find the Engineer</i>
<i>and take back what's mine. "</i>

272
00:32:59,193 --> 00:33:02,959
Hunt for the Engineer
and the Engineer hunts you.

273
00:33:03,031 --> 00:33:05,124
What did you say?

274
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:09,368
Nothing.
It's just this...

275
00:33:09,437 --> 00:33:12,167
When people...

276
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,174
hunt for the Engineer,

277
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,176
they say...

278
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,178
then the Engineer
will hunt you.

279
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,852
So then what happened?

280
00:33:27,055 --> 00:33:29,489
<i>Terry kept looking,</i>

281
00:33:29,557 --> 00:33:34,153
<i>but he never found the Engineer</i> <i>and to this
day he's never</i> <i>seen the Engineer again. </i>

282
00:33:34,228 --> 00:33:36,162
<i>But... </i>

283
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,664
<i>Terry started</i>
<i>getting these gifts,</i>

284
00:33:38,733 --> 00:33:41,998
<i>like the Engineer</i>
<i>was sending him a message. </i>

285
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:45,005
<i>A box would show up</i>
<i>on his doorstep,</i>

286
00:33:45,073 --> 00:33:48,338
<i>or something would come in the mail</i>...
<i>a locket that she once wore,</i>

287
00:33:48,409 --> 00:33:51,469
<i>or a clump of her hair. </i>

288
00:33:51,546 --> 00:33:53,480
<i>When her wedding ring</i>
<i>arrived,</i>

289
00:33:53,548 --> 00:33:55,482
<i>Terry figured</i>
<i>that she was dead. </i>

290
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:58,110
<i>But he kept looking. </i>

291
00:33:58,186 --> 00:34:01,246
<i>And then just as it happened</i>
<i>when she disappeared,</i>

292
00:34:01,322 --> 00:34:04,189
<i>Terry came home one morning</i>
<i>and she was back again,</i>

293
00:34:04,258 --> 00:34:07,193
<i>just laying there in his bed,</i>
<i>sleeping like a little baby. </i>

294
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:12,465
<i>He tiptoed</i>
<i>over to the bed... </i>

295
00:34:12,533 --> 00:34:15,468
<i>so he could</i>
<i>slide in next to her. </i>

296
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,466
<i>He pulled back the covers,</i>

297
00:34:20,775 --> 00:34:22,709
<i>but she wasn't there. </i>

298
00:34:23,945 --> 00:34:26,379
<i>What do you mean, she wasn't</i>...

299
00:34:27,615 --> 00:34:30,550
<i> Just a note where</i>
<i>her body should have been. </i>

300
00:34:32,186 --> 00:34:33,778
<i>It said:</i>

301
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:37,983
"You win, Terry.

302
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:41,256
I kept what I needed.
The rest is yours. "

303
00:34:46,367 --> 00:34:47,925
You believe that story?

304
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:51,301
I saw his face when he told me.
Terry wouldn't make that up.

305
00:34:51,372 --> 00:34:53,465
You talk to Terry.

306
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:57,136
I don't talk to the guy anymore.
I don't know where he is... Aah!

307
00:34:57,211 --> 00:35:00,146
You talk to him.

308
00:35:00,214 --> 00:35:03,581
By the end of the day I wanna know
where I can find the Engineer.

309
00:35:11,058 --> 00:35:13,083
<i> You get anything</i>
<i>from the ice cream man?</i>

310
00:35:14,328 --> 00:35:17,161
- Any information, I mean.
- What's up, Tony?

311
00:35:17,231 --> 00:35:19,392
What's bothering you?

312
00:35:20,768 --> 00:35:22,702
I just...

313
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:27,104
I just think there's some lines you set,
and you don't cross 'em.

314
00:35:27,175 --> 00:35:29,109
Period.

315
00:35:29,177 --> 00:35:32,943
Otherwise you just keep crossin' 'em
one after another, you know,

316
00:35:33,014 --> 00:35:35,448
until you're just lost.

317
00:35:35,516 --> 00:35:37,450
We're partners.

318
00:35:37,518 --> 00:35:39,577
And that matters.
That means something to me.

319
00:35:39,654 --> 00:35:41,588
But I can't do this,
Joe.

320
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,788
I'm gonna tell the captain
about Daphne,

321
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,294
<i>about wipin'</i>
<i>your prints off. </i>

322
00:35:48,362 --> 00:35:50,853
<i>I'm gonna tell him</i>
<i>what we did. </i>

323
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,966
I believe
you didn't kill that girl.

324
00:35:55,036 --> 00:35:56,970
Tell him with me.

325
00:35:57,038 --> 00:36:00,337
<i>It's the right thing</i>
<i>to do. </i>

326
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:04,538
Well, you're right
about one thing, Tony.

327
00:36:04,612 --> 00:36:07,240
I didn't kill that girl.

328
00:36:07,315 --> 00:36:11,183
And I'm not gonna let anything get
in the way of me finding out who did.

329
00:36:15,456 --> 00:36:17,890
Where's your pen?

330
00:36:19,961 --> 00:36:21,895
Your pen.

331
00:36:21,963 --> 00:36:25,296
The one with your initials on it.
The one your wife gave you.

332
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:27,857
I don't know.

333
00:36:30,137 --> 00:36:33,072
That's right. It's probably
at the crime lab by now.

334
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:36,667
Forensics picked it up.
You left it at the scene.

335
00:36:36,744 --> 00:36:40,544
<i>And that last pack</i>
<i>of cigarettes you smoked,</i>

336
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,550
the one with your fingerprints
all over the wrapper...

337
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,018
You left your smokes
there too, Tony.

338
00:36:46,087 --> 00:36:48,487
- You took my cigarettes?
- <i>No. </i>

339
00:36:48,556 --> 00:36:51,252
No, no, no.
You came to me, remember?

340
00:36:51,325 --> 00:36:52,815
- I what?
- <i>Yeah. </i>

341
00:36:52,894 --> 00:36:54,987
Yeah, 'cause you
fucked some whore...

342
00:36:55,062 --> 00:36:57,997
and, holy shit, found her
dead the next morning.

343
00:36:58,065 --> 00:37:01,865
You asked me to help you wipe
the place clean, cover your tracks.

344
00:37:01,936 --> 00:37:04,461
I should never have done it,

345
00:37:04,538 --> 00:37:07,905
but as anyone knows,
I am nothing if not a loyal partner.

346
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,842
<i>You have two years</i>
<i>in the precinct. </i>

347
00:37:10,912 --> 00:37:13,847
Now, who do you think they're
gonna believe, me or you?

348
00:37:13,915 --> 00:37:16,406
Especially considering
all the evidence.

349
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,418
You fuckin' scumbag.

350
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,421
You planned it?
You fucked me, and you planned this?

351
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,754
<i>No. </i>
<i>Nobody is gonna get fucked. </i>

352
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,259
You see,
that is the beauty of it.

353
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:30,126
When the crime lab
files its report,

354
00:37:30,197 --> 00:37:33,758
<i>I'll tell the captain that you were</i>
<i>shaken up by what we found at the scene. </i>

355
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:37,964
I saw you have a smoke and touch a few
things before you put on the gloves.

356
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:42,703
<i>It's a simple mistake. The worst</i>
<i>you're gonna get is a verbal reprimand. </i>

357
00:37:42,777 --> 00:37:45,712
I don't want to
make you look bad.

358
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,714
I'll take care of you.

359
00:37:48,883 --> 00:37:50,976
Just gotta cover my ass,
that's all.

360
00:37:53,054 --> 00:37:54,988
And I trusted you.

361
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:15,069
Detective Thorne?
This is for you.

362
00:38:45,106 --> 00:38:49,543
Stop. Please stop.

363
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,544
No more. No. No!

364
00:39:05,893 --> 00:39:08,293
<i>Please! Please!</i>

365
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:05,450
This...

366
00:40:07,088 --> 00:40:09,056
I don't
understand this.

367
00:40:09,123 --> 00:40:13,184
<i>Can you run a test on the videotape</i>
<i>to see if it's been erased?</i>

368
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,388
I can tell if it's been erased, but I
can't tell you what was on it before that,

369
00:40:16,464 --> 00:40:18,694
if anything.

370
00:40:18,766 --> 00:40:21,360
I know what was on it.
I know what I saw.

371
00:40:21,435 --> 00:40:25,462
<i> Joseph, we've already been</i>
<i>through the entire tape twice. </i>

372
00:40:25,539 --> 00:40:28,906
- <i>There's nothing there. </i>
- I saw what I fucking saw!

373
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,637
<i>Gentlemen,</i>
<i>let's move on. </i>

374
00:40:31,712 --> 00:40:33,646
We all have
work to do.

375
00:40:33,714 --> 00:40:36,547
Joseph, if you could
stay here a moment, please.

376
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,745
<i>I'm concerned about</i>
<i>your state of mind. </i>

377
00:40:40,821 --> 00:40:42,448
Bernie's your snitch,
right?

378
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,548
<i>Was</i> my snitch.

379
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:47,788
And you knew the first victim, Jay Cho.

380
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,990
I barely knew him.
It was years ago.

381
00:40:51,065 --> 00:40:54,762
My instincts keep telling me something's
not right here. I'm very concerned.

382
00:40:54,835 --> 00:40:56,769
<i>Now,</i>
<i>I could suspend you,</i>

383
00:40:56,837 --> 00:40:59,305
but I won't do that.

384
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:03,207
However, I will make a formal request
that you see the department counselor.

385
00:41:03,277 --> 00:41:06,713
I don't have time for that, Captain.
There's a child's life at stake.

386
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,715
All the more reason.
It's not optional.

387
00:41:09,783 --> 00:41:13,651
<i>Now, go make an appointment before</i>
<i>you do any more work on this case. </i>

388
00:41:19,693 --> 00:41:22,628
Expect to see me
come out in handcuffs?

389
00:41:22,696 --> 00:41:25,790
No. Why?
Did you do somethin' bad?

390
00:41:34,842 --> 00:41:36,810
<i>Leon Gaultier. </i>

391
00:41:36,877 --> 00:41:39,505
His fingerprints
were on the box.

392
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,480
The box?

393
00:41:41,549 --> 00:41:44,313
<i>The one at</i>
<i>the Jay Cho crime scene. </i>

394
00:41:44,385 --> 00:41:46,319
It was under the candle.

395
00:41:46,387 --> 00:41:48,321
<i> Jay stole it</i>
<i>from Leon. </i>

396
00:41:48,389 --> 00:41:50,687
Thanks for keepin' me
informed, partner.

397
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,692
I'm telling you, Tony,

398
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,695
I saw the murder weapon,
the one that killed Bernie.

399
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,288
It was on the wall
at Leon's shop.

400
00:41:58,365 --> 00:42:01,300
What, the whip on the videotape?

401
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:05,361
<i> Just find Leon... </i>

402
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,373
and pick him up, okay?

403
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:11,138
- And keep an eye out for Bernie's van.
- What are you gonna do?

404
00:42:13,214 --> 00:42:16,149
I'm gonna go lie down
and talk about my childhood.

405
00:42:18,219 --> 00:42:22,679
<i>So, were you involved</i>
<i>in the use of deadly force?</i>

406
00:42:22,756 --> 00:42:24,690
Not lately.

407
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,221
Substance problems?

408
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:31,059
- <i>Problems at home?</i>
- Didn't the captain tell you why I'm here?

409
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,863
No.
Why are you here?

410
00:42:34,935 --> 00:42:39,201
Well, not because
I want to be.

411
00:42:39,273 --> 00:42:41,207
Please sit down.

412
00:42:44,245 --> 00:42:49,945
These sessions are informal. We can
just talk about anything you like.

413
00:42:50,017 --> 00:42:52,850
- <i>That's a nice picture. </i>
- <i>It's my daughter Melissa. </i>

414
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,081
- She's six.
- I have a little girl too.

415
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:57,385
She's gonna be nine
in about a month.

416
00:42:57,458 --> 00:42:59,949
So I take it
you're not a priest?

417
00:43:00,027 --> 00:43:02,291
Episcopal.

418
00:43:02,363 --> 00:43:04,297
We get to have
a little fun.

419
00:43:05,899 --> 00:43:08,834
She's the best thing
in my life.

420
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:12,029
I envy children.

421
00:43:12,106 --> 00:43:14,040
I envy their innocence.

422
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:17,134
Yeah. Me too.

423
00:43:17,211 --> 00:43:19,941
<i>That's a Chinese thing, right?</i>
<i>For stress. </i>

424
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,948
Oh, that...

425
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,452
just keeps me
in the zone.

426
00:43:27,888 --> 00:43:30,448
Close-up magic.

427
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:33,891
- I bet your daughter loves that.
- <i>I don't know. </i>

428
00:43:35,496 --> 00:43:38,988
I guess I just mostly use it
to entertain myself.

429
00:43:39,066 --> 00:43:41,159
<i>Listen,</i>

430
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:46,971
could we, um, reschedule this
for some other time?

431
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,975
'Cause I haven't
got much sleep.

432
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:52,843
- How about tomorrow at 10:00?
- Oh. Okay. Sure.

433
00:43:55,816 --> 00:43:57,841
Thank you.

434
00:43:57,918 --> 00:43:59,852
Take care, Detective.

435
00:44:05,693 --> 00:44:08,924
<i> Dr. Gregory said that</i>
<i>he envied the innocence of children. </i>

436
00:44:08,996 --> 00:44:13,160
<i>But staring at the faces</i>
<i>of a thousand missing kids,</i>

437
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,963
<i>envy is the last thing</i>
<i>you feel. </i>

438
00:44:16,036 --> 00:44:18,800
<i>All I felt was rage. </i>

439
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:24,304
<i>Children are the only sacred</i>
<i>thing left in this world. </i>

440
00:44:24,378 --> 00:44:27,211
<i>And most of these little ones</i>
<i>were gone for good. </i>

441
00:44:27,281 --> 00:44:29,647
<i>But not the kid</i>
<i>I was looking for. </i>

442
00:44:29,717 --> 00:44:32,311
<i>That child was still alive. </i>

443
00:44:32,386 --> 00:44:36,823
<i>If I could keep it that way,</i> <i>I knew it would
be the best</i> <i>thing I'd do in my lifetime. </i>

444
00:44:50,838 --> 00:44:53,773
Hey yourself, Detective.
What's the problem?

445
00:44:57,711 --> 00:45:00,373
They found your snitch.

446
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:09,085
- I got three of my guys up there running around.
- All right, thanks.

447
00:45:11,158 --> 00:45:13,888
It's another fuckin' mess,

448
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,895
just like
you described it.

449
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,090
Are you surprised?

450
00:45:18,165 --> 00:45:20,099
No, not really.

451
00:45:20,167 --> 00:45:23,830
- <i> You got two of those?</i>
- <i> Yeah, here's one. </i>

452
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,735
<i>Mark that "B."</i>

453
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:30,436
<i>All right, everybody just,</i>
<i>uh, just get out. </i>

454
00:45:40,921 --> 00:45:43,014
It's got a voice mail.

455
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:46,685
You have one unheard voice message.

456
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,457
Bernie, it's Terry. Listen, about
the per... the thing we talked about...

457
00:45:50,531 --> 00:45:54,865
Find Mr. Parmaggi at a place called The
Crossing at the end of Old Mining Road.

458
00:45:54,935 --> 00:45:58,200
Now we're even, all right?
After this, I don't owe you a dime.

459
00:45:58,272 --> 00:46:01,207
End of message.

460
00:46:02,376 --> 00:46:04,810
Doesn't this guy
usually give us a finger?

461
00:46:04,878 --> 00:46:06,869
Yeah, but we ain't
found one yet.

462
00:46:06,947 --> 00:46:09,438
- <i> The cash register. </i>
- What?

463
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:12,917
It's in
the fucking cash register!

464
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:20,226
It was on
the fucking videotape!

465
00:46:23,297 --> 00:46:25,925
Let's go, partner.

466
00:46:31,672 --> 00:46:34,835
<i>Maybe this guy just wants his box back. </i>

467
00:46:34,908 --> 00:46:38,469
No, that box was left in plain sight
at the first murder scene.

468
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:41,412
<i>If he wanted the box,</i>
<i>he'd have it by now. </i>

469
00:46:41,482 --> 00:46:45,009
No, this figures
for some kind of message.

470
00:46:45,085 --> 00:46:50,148
He's telling me if I keep looking for him
he's gonna kill that child, and I'll die too.

471
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:53,125
Hunt for the Engineer,
and the Engineer will hunt you.

472
00:46:53,193 --> 00:46:57,459
- What?
- He won't have to hunt for long, I can tell you that.

473
00:47:14,715 --> 00:47:16,979
You with me?

474
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:19,143
Whatever you say,
partner.

475
00:48:19,713 --> 00:48:22,307
Well, I see chips,
but I...

476
00:48:22,382 --> 00:48:24,316
I don't see a cashier.

477
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,753
You know
where I can buy in?

478
00:48:30,023 --> 00:48:32,184
I'm looking
for Mr. Parmaggi.

479
00:48:32,259 --> 00:48:34,090
Does he still
work here?

480
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,595
I do,

481
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:39,632
and I know all the faces,

482
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,635
though I can't say
I remember yours.

483
00:48:42,703 --> 00:48:45,638
- Those six-guns look real.
- Are you here to play?

484
00:48:47,407 --> 00:48:50,934
I have a permit for the guns,
if you'd like to see it.

485
00:48:57,918 --> 00:49:00,045
Are you the Engineer?

486
00:49:01,121 --> 00:49:03,248
You flatter me, sir.

487
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,126
Well,

488
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,458
I'm not going away.

489
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:12,464
You can tell him that. Okay?

490
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:16,593
I got his message, and you can
give him this message for me:

491
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:21,107
I'm not gonna stop until
I find that child... alive.

492
00:49:21,174 --> 00:49:23,108
I can assure you,
Detective,

493
00:49:23,176 --> 00:49:27,840
you're quite mistaken about
the Engineer's... message.

494
00:49:27,914 --> 00:49:30,678
Don't fuck with me.

495
00:49:30,751 --> 00:49:34,243
You like to play games,
don't you, Detective?

496
00:49:34,321 --> 00:49:37,256
<i>The Engineer</i>
<i>likes games,</i>

497
00:49:37,324 --> 00:49:41,761
and it appears that you're playing
one of his games right now.

498
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:47,227
He doesn't want you to stop.

499
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,269
He wants you
to play the game.

500
00:49:51,872 --> 00:49:54,807
You think this is
a goddamn game?

501
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,875
Tony?

502
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:57,254
I'm still gonna find that child.

503
00:51:58,465 --> 00:52:00,399
That, I suspect,

504
00:52:00,467 --> 00:52:02,799
is the object of the game.

505
00:52:22,489 --> 00:52:25,856
<i> Joseph! Joe. </i>

506
00:52:27,994 --> 00:52:30,292
Holy shit.
Come on.

507
00:52:41,708 --> 00:52:43,642
Turn it off.

508
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:46,838
Turn it off!

509
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:49,643
I've been trying to keep you conscious.

510
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:54,516
- Where are we going?
- <i>To the hospital. We're gettin'close. </i>

511
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:58,149
I'm sorry, man. I got lost in the woods.
I should have been there.

512
00:52:58,225 --> 00:53:01,058
- <i>Take me to the house. </i>
- What?

513
00:53:01,127 --> 00:53:03,618
Man, you gotta go to the hospital.
You're fucked up.

514
00:53:03,697 --> 00:53:06,461
- <i>You could have a concussion. </i>
- Just take me back to the squad!

515
00:53:15,842 --> 00:53:18,572
- Joseph?
- I need to talk.

516
00:53:18,645 --> 00:53:20,840
Of course.
Please come in.

517
00:53:24,484 --> 00:53:26,850
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I think I'm losing it.

518
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,855
Why don't you sit down? What do you mean?

519
00:53:29,923 --> 00:53:32,687
I think I'm going insane.

520
00:53:32,759 --> 00:53:36,286
That's a thought
insane people rarely have.

521
00:53:36,363 --> 00:53:39,196
Joseph, please,
sit down.

522
00:53:39,266 --> 00:53:43,362
I'm afraid if I sit down,
I'm never gonna get up again.

523
00:53:47,574 --> 00:53:49,508
Years ago...

524
00:53:49,576 --> 00:53:52,044
when I was first
on the force,

525
00:53:52,112 --> 00:53:55,604
I heard about somebody
called the Engineer.

526
00:53:55,682 --> 00:53:57,673
I always thought
it was just a...

527
00:53:57,751 --> 00:54:01,983
some campfire story to scare
academy cadets and rookies.

528
00:54:02,055 --> 00:54:04,421
And then today,

529
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:07,551
I heard his name again.

530
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:12,821
You know what I'm
talking about?

531
00:54:12,899 --> 00:54:16,426
- Oh, please, continue what you were...
- Answer my question!

532
00:54:18,238 --> 00:54:20,832
What do you know
about the Engineer?

533
00:54:52,105 --> 00:54:55,768
I've returned to this file
many times.

534
00:54:55,842 --> 00:54:59,209
It was 1986, my first year
as department counselor.

535
00:55:01,014 --> 00:55:03,983
He was a veteran like you,
good at his job.

536
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,883
Until he caught a case
where everything led to one man...

537
00:55:06,953 --> 00:55:10,480
known only by his street name,
the Engineer.

538
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:14,653
This detective began
to mistrust his own instincts.

539
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:18,459
Self-doubt grew
into paranoia.

540
00:55:18,531 --> 00:55:20,897
<i>And in his delusions,</i>

541
00:55:20,967 --> 00:55:24,266
<i>he elevated the Engineer into a figure</i>
<i>of almost supernatural power. </i>

542
00:55:24,337 --> 00:55:28,535
He said the Engineer knew everything
about every cop on the force,

543
00:55:28,608 --> 00:55:31,168
<i>especially him. </i>

544
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:34,509
His anxiety rapidly shifted
into a deep depression...

545
00:55:35,982 --> 00:55:39,679
till one day he came to work,
sat down behind his desk...

546
00:55:41,021 --> 00:55:42,955
and shot himself
in the head.

547
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,456
What do you see there?

548
00:55:49,529 --> 00:55:53,124
The detective had it with him
when he shot himself.

549
00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:57,067
I must admit that I was intrigued
enough to actually go and look for it,

550
00:55:57,137 --> 00:55:59,537
<i>but when I checked</i>
<i>the evidence archives,</i>

551
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,699
it was gone.

552
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:04,369
So it's probably either lost
or destroyed by now.

553
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:07,311
<i>All that's left of it</i>
<i>is the picture. </i>

554
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:17,419
What is it?

555
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:21,722
<i>You couldn't get it out of your head. </i>
<i>I think you know. </i>

556
00:56:23,663 --> 00:56:26,325
You're right.
I did some research.

557
00:56:27,834 --> 00:56:30,394
It's called
the Lament Configuration.

558
00:56:32,172 --> 00:56:35,266
It appears in occult literature here
and there throughout the centuries.

559
00:56:35,341 --> 00:56:37,332
What do they say about it?

560
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:41,346
<i>They say it's a window</i>
<i>or a gateway. </i>

561
00:56:41,414 --> 00:56:43,348
You open it,

562
00:56:43,416 --> 00:56:47,011
they come for you
and they tear you apart.

563
00:56:49,689 --> 00:56:51,623
"They"?

564
00:56:51,691 --> 00:56:55,957
Some call them Cenobites. Others call
them demons and say they take you to hell.

565
00:56:56,029 --> 00:56:59,055
Well, they didn't
take me to hell.

566
00:57:02,035 --> 00:57:05,402
- You opened the box?
- <i>Yeah, last night. </i>

567
00:57:06,473 --> 00:57:09,874
I had some... nightmare,

568
00:57:09,943 --> 00:57:12,207
and...

569
00:57:12,278 --> 00:57:14,212
ever since then,

570
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,475
I've been seeing...

571
00:57:17,784 --> 00:57:19,718
them.

572
00:57:22,655 --> 00:57:26,819
Am I going crazy?

573
00:57:28,561 --> 00:57:32,327
I'm more of a psychiatrist
than I am a priest.

574
00:57:32,398 --> 00:57:36,425
Ask me if I believe in the devil,
I don't know what to say.

575
00:57:36,503 --> 00:57:39,267
But ask me about this box,

576
00:57:39,339 --> 00:57:41,671
from what I've seen
and read,

577
00:57:41,741 --> 00:57:43,675
I believe it's real.

578
00:57:43,743 --> 00:57:46,974
<i>But the history's</i>
<i>consistent. </i>

579
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:50,174
It opens,
they come for you...

580
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:52,184
and they leave.

581
00:57:52,252 --> 00:57:55,415
<i>So if you're saying</i>
<i>they left you behind,</i>

582
00:57:55,488 --> 00:57:58,514
and you're still seeing them,

583
00:57:58,591 --> 00:58:00,786
then maybe
they're still here.

584
00:58:09,102 --> 00:58:11,468
<i>I live in a world of facts,</i>

585
00:58:11,538 --> 00:58:13,802
<i>of close attention</i>
<i>to detail. </i>

586
00:58:13,873 --> 00:58:16,137
<i>No matter how confusing</i>
<i>the mystery,</i>

587
00:58:16,209 --> 00:58:18,507
<i>no matter how difficult</i>
<i>the puzzle,</i>

588
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:23,208
<i>the answer is always seen</i>
<i>and the end is natural as rain. </i>

589
00:58:23,283 --> 00:58:27,151
<i>Everything... every process,</i>
<i>no matter how complex,</i>

590
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:29,484
<i>is a piece of reality</i>
<i>in the end. </i>

591
00:58:29,556 --> 00:58:32,389
<i>And the design</i>
<i>can be understood. </i>

592
00:58:32,458 --> 00:58:36,053
<i>All things can eventually</i>
<i>be explained. </i>

593
00:58:36,129 --> 00:58:40,225
<i>But maybe some facts</i>
<i>are in the eye of the beholder. </i>

594
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,234
Mommy, wait!

595
00:58:42,302 --> 00:58:46,466
<i>And maybe some explanations</i>
<i>are not of this world. </i>

596
00:58:46,539 --> 00:58:49,133
<i>Help me!</i>

597
00:59:05,091 --> 00:59:08,857
Where have you been?
You've not called me. I have paged you.

598
00:59:08,928 --> 00:59:12,193
Told you I was working a case.

599
00:59:12,265 --> 00:59:15,598
Why do you keep lying
to me, Joseph?

600
00:59:15,668 --> 00:59:18,398
You cannot keep doing this.
We...

601
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:20,996
Oh, my God.
What happened to you?

602
00:59:21,074 --> 00:59:24,407
<i>I got jumped by a couple of guys,</i>
<i>but I'm all right. </i>

603
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:28,641
Daddy, are you home yet?

604
00:59:28,715 --> 00:59:33,652
No, sweetheart, I'm just... I'm here for
a little while, and then I gotta go.

605
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:36,018
Come in here
with me.

606
00:59:36,089 --> 00:59:39,490
- When are you coming home?
- Shh.

607
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:43,393
Sweetie, just go back to sleep.

608
01:00:21,266 --> 01:00:23,700
It's okay.

609
01:00:59,938 --> 01:01:01,997
Hello?

610
01:01:02,074 --> 01:01:04,668
<i>Hi. How are you?</i>

611
01:01:07,379 --> 01:01:10,371
<i>Wait!</i>
<i>Hello?</i>

612
01:01:10,449 --> 01:01:12,383
<i>Hello?</i>

613
01:01:14,753 --> 01:01:17,586
<i>That was your mother. </i>

614
01:01:17,656 --> 01:01:20,989
- What?
- She said that she had a visitor.

615
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:24,290
<i>Someone that you were looking for,</i>
<i>or something like that?</i>

616
01:01:24,363 --> 01:01:28,129
I think that she said he was
some kind of engineer.

617
01:01:33,071 --> 01:01:35,665
I don't want you
to leave this house.

618
01:01:35,741 --> 01:01:38,403
Do you understand me?

619
01:01:40,712 --> 01:01:43,647
I want you to lock all the doors
and the windows.

620
01:01:43,715 --> 01:01:47,310
Do you remember how to use this?
Do you remember?

621
01:01:47,386 --> 01:01:50,321
Yes! Are you in
some kind of trouble?

622
01:01:50,389 --> 01:01:54,189
Yes, I am.
We are.

623
01:01:54,259 --> 01:01:56,750
Daddy?

624
01:01:56,828 --> 01:01:59,695
- Just do as I say.
- <i>Daddy?</i>

625
01:01:59,765 --> 01:02:02,529
Please, just tell me something!

626
01:02:02,601 --> 01:02:04,535
Daddy!

627
01:02:04,603 --> 01:02:07,800
- It's okay, baby.
- I want my daddy.

628
01:02:07,873 --> 01:02:10,000
Daddy's gone.

629
01:02:31,063 --> 01:02:32,997
Can I help you, sir?

630
01:02:33,065 --> 01:02:35,966
Yes, I'm here to see Art
and Mary Thorne. I'm their son, Joseph.

631
01:02:36,034 --> 01:02:38,025
I didn't know
the Thornes had a son.

632
01:02:40,105 --> 01:02:43,666
Did they have
any other visitors today?

633
01:02:43,742 --> 01:02:45,869
Are you sure
you're really their son?

634
01:02:45,944 --> 01:02:49,880
Look, lady,
this is an emergency.

635
01:02:53,418 --> 01:02:55,886
They had no other
visitors today,

636
01:02:55,954 --> 01:02:59,048
or any other day
that I can remember.

637
01:02:59,124 --> 01:03:01,649
<i>You'll have to sign in. </i>
<i>Room 116.</i>

638
01:03:01,726 --> 01:03:03,887
Sir, you have to check in.

639
01:03:03,962 --> 01:03:05,896
Sir, please slow down.

640
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,554
What a fine-looking boy.

641
01:04:03,155 --> 01:04:06,249
<i>Mom, you guys okay?</i>

642
01:04:06,324 --> 01:04:08,258
<i>Why don't you</i>
<i>visit us, Joe?</i>

643
01:04:08,326 --> 01:04:11,159
He gets a little worse
every day.

644
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:28,403
We never
see you anymore.

645
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,414
We don't
like it here.

646
01:04:30,482 --> 01:04:35,146
I don't know, Mom.
L... I try.

647
01:04:42,861 --> 01:04:45,455
<i>Help me!</i>

648
01:04:51,636 --> 01:04:53,934
<i> Joseph Thorne?</i>

649
01:04:54,005 --> 01:04:56,269
You put
that thing away.

650
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:32,176
Mom? Mom, let me in.

651
01:05:32,244 --> 01:05:35,236
<i> Please, no. </i>

652
01:05:35,313 --> 01:05:38,077
<i> Oh, God!</i>

653
01:05:57,736 --> 01:05:59,670
Stop!

654
01:06:31,636 --> 01:06:33,570
<i>Hello?</i>

655
01:06:34,739 --> 01:06:37,606
<i>Oh, h i. </i> <i>How are you?</i>

656
01:06:37,676 --> 01:06:40,804
Wait.
Hello?

657
01:06:40,879 --> 01:06:42,813
Hello?

658
01:06:44,716 --> 01:06:47,810
- That was your mother.
- What?

659
01:06:47,886 --> 01:06:50,719
She said that
she had a visitor.

660
01:06:50,789 --> 01:06:53,280
Someone that you were looking for,
or something like that?

661
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:56,953
I think that she said he was
some kind of an engineer.

662
01:07:09,007 --> 01:07:10,941
Sir? Sir, wait!

663
01:07:11,009 --> 01:07:12,943
That man had a gun!

664
01:07:18,316 --> 01:07:20,750
<i></i>
<i>Don't you fuckin'move!</i>

665
01:07:22,587 --> 01:07:25,147
<i>Drop it!</i>

666
01:07:27,225 --> 01:07:29,159
Turn around.

667
01:07:32,731 --> 01:07:35,165
I'm with the Denver P.D.

668
01:07:35,233 --> 01:07:37,997
I'm a detective.
I'm looking for the Thornes.

669
01:07:38,069 --> 01:07:40,469
<i>Yes, we've been expecting you. </i>

670
01:07:40,538 --> 01:07:43,769
If you had only shown
some identification...

671
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:48,475
- I'm their son.
- I didn't know the Thornes had a son.

672
01:07:54,686 --> 01:07:56,620
They're not here, sir.

673
01:07:56,688 --> 01:07:59,054
We called the police
almost an hour ago.

674
01:07:59,124 --> 01:08:03,185
They've been missing since dinner,
and we've searched all around.

675
01:08:03,261 --> 01:08:05,695
They just seem
to have vanished.

676
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:23,914
<i>So strange. </i>

677
01:08:23,982 --> 01:08:26,974
Mr. Thorne isn't able to
leave the bed anymore...

678
01:08:27,051 --> 01:08:29,212
and they've never
been prone to wander,

679
01:08:29,287 --> 01:08:31,551
like some of our...

680
01:09:47,065 --> 01:09:49,499
Hey. Your wife said
you might be here.

681
01:09:52,003 --> 01:09:53,937
Tony.

682
01:09:54,005 --> 01:09:57,099
Look, I know you have no reason
to trust me right now,

683
01:09:57,175 --> 01:10:00,110
but I just got a little note
from the Engineer.

684
01:10:00,178 --> 01:10:03,909
- I want you to come with me to this address.
- Captain wants to see you.

685
01:10:05,884 --> 01:10:07,818
Did you tell him
about Daphne?

686
01:10:07,886 --> 01:10:10,821
No, not yet.
You're outta control, Joe.

687
01:10:10,889 --> 01:10:14,086
Well, then come with me!
We can catch this son of a bitch!

688
01:10:14,158 --> 01:10:16,683
We can...
We can end all this!

689
01:10:17,929 --> 01:10:21,729
Tony, I need you, man.
I'm fucking scared here.

690
01:10:21,799 --> 01:10:24,962
Then come in with me.
We'll talk to the captain together.

691
01:10:24,997 --> 01:10:29,336
And tell him what, huh?
Tell him about the Engineer?

692
01:10:29,407 --> 01:10:32,171
He's not gonna believe my story
until I can prove...

693
01:10:32,243 --> 01:10:34,507
that the Engineer
is the connection!

694
01:10:34,579 --> 01:10:38,174
He's not the fuckin' connection, Joe!
You're the fuckin' connection!

695
01:10:38,249 --> 01:10:41,810
<i>You knew Daphne,</i>
<i>Bernie and Jay Cho. </i>

696
01:10:41,886 --> 01:10:43,820
There is no Engineer.

697
01:10:45,924 --> 01:10:48,449
There's just you.

698
01:10:59,304 --> 01:11:01,534
- Son of a...
- <i>Get up!</i>

699
01:11:01,606 --> 01:11:03,540
Bitch.

700
01:11:03,608 --> 01:11:06,475
You really think
I could kill those people?

701
01:11:06,544 --> 01:11:08,478
You really think
I could do that?

702
01:11:08,546 --> 01:11:11,140
You were with the girl,
you knew about Bernie...

703
01:11:11,215 --> 01:11:15,447
and there was nothin' on the goddamn videotape,
and you knew where to find the finger.

704
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,954
What am I supposed
to think, huh?

705
01:11:19,591 --> 01:11:22,651
Come on, man. I didn't mean
to do that. Now, come on.

706
01:11:24,729 --> 01:11:28,165
Do you really think
I could do those things?

707
01:11:28,232 --> 01:11:30,166
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i> Joseph. </i>

708
01:11:30,234 --> 01:11:33,863
You ask me yesterday, I-I'd say,
"No fuckin' way," but today,

709
01:11:33,938 --> 01:11:36,907
<i>I just don't know. </i>

710
01:11:42,947 --> 01:11:44,881
You need help, Joe.

711
01:11:44,949 --> 01:11:46,883
Go to hell.

712
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:45,160
<i>Tony?</i>

713
01:13:45,236 --> 01:13:47,170
<i>No. </i>

714
01:14:24,776 --> 01:14:27,040
Six fingers,

715
01:14:27,111 --> 01:14:29,045
six murders.

716
01:14:30,681 --> 01:14:33,206
Only four
fingers left.

717
01:14:40,358 --> 01:14:42,792
Do you know who I am,
Detective?

718
01:14:43,861 --> 01:14:47,888
Oh, let me guess.

719
01:14:47,965 --> 01:14:49,956
You're the Engineer.

720
01:14:52,804 --> 01:14:54,738
I got your message,

721
01:14:54,806 --> 01:14:57,240
and I understand
your fucking game.

722
01:14:58,709 --> 01:15:00,973
Is the child
even alive?

723
01:15:07,218 --> 01:15:09,880
What do you want
from me?

724
01:15:09,954 --> 01:15:12,684
I want you to go home,
Detective.

725
01:15:12,757 --> 01:15:14,748
Time to go home.

726
01:15:17,461 --> 01:15:19,861
We have an officer down.

727
01:15:19,931 --> 01:15:22,263
Mountain Vista
Elementary School.

728
01:15:22,333 --> 01:15:24,597
I don't know the address.
I'm not at the scene.

729
01:15:24,669 --> 01:15:28,036
Just get a unit there
immediately. Out.

730
01:16:18,122 --> 01:16:20,716
<i>Welcome home,</i>
<i>Detective. </i>

731
01:16:25,463 --> 01:16:28,660
<i>It takes hours</i>
<i>to die from exposure. </i>

732
01:16:28,733 --> 01:16:31,395
<i>Hours in which</i>
<i>no one came home. </i>

733
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:35,234
No one was here
to hear them cry.

734
01:16:38,309 --> 01:16:41,642
<i>Why do you keep</i>
<i>lying to me, Joseph?</i>

735
01:16:41,712 --> 01:16:43,839
You can't
keep doing this.

736
01:16:43,915 --> 01:16:47,544
<i>Daddy?</i>
<i>Are you home?</i>

737
01:16:51,722 --> 01:16:56,182
Yes, baby, Daddy's home.
He's here.

738
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:58,194
I miss you, Daddy.

739
01:16:58,262 --> 01:17:00,594
When are you
coming home?

740
01:18:05,062 --> 01:18:06,996
They found Tony.

741
01:18:07,064 --> 01:18:11,626
<i>And the child's finger,</i>
<i>the one the killer left in his mouth. </i>

742
01:18:11,702 --> 01:18:13,966
<i>Only this time</i>
<i>the print wasn't burned off. </i>

743
01:18:14,038 --> 01:18:17,030
They ran the print
taken from the severed finger...

744
01:18:17,108 --> 01:18:22,011
and like a miracle,
got a match almost instantly.

745
01:18:22,079 --> 01:18:25,913
<i>What they found doesn't make</i>
<i>any sense though, Joseph,</i>

746
01:18:25,983 --> 01:18:29,111
because the child's
fingerprint...

747
01:18:29,186 --> 01:18:31,120
Well, it's yours.

748
01:18:33,691 --> 01:18:35,818
I don't understand.

749
01:18:37,862 --> 01:18:39,921
I know.

750
01:18:39,997 --> 01:18:42,989
You even misunderstood me
when I told you to go home.

751
01:18:43,067 --> 01:18:45,001
I didn't mean
this place.

752
01:18:46,604 --> 01:18:48,538
I meant
your first home.

753
01:18:48,606 --> 01:18:50,870
<i>The home you grew up in. </i>

754
01:18:52,009 --> 01:18:53,943
<i>I can help you</i>
<i>understand. </i>

755
01:18:54,011 --> 01:18:57,447
You see, I know everything
about you, Joseph.

756
01:19:01,218 --> 01:19:03,152
Your file's
almost complete.

757
01:19:21,305 --> 01:19:23,569
You're the Engineer.

758
01:19:26,710 --> 01:19:29,144
It's as good a name as any.

759
01:19:55,673 --> 01:19:57,607
What are you?

760
01:19:57,675 --> 01:20:02,942
What I am, who I am,
is no concern of yours.

761
01:20:04,982 --> 01:20:07,746
I am not
the killer.

762
01:20:07,818 --> 01:20:09,752
To find him,

763
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:12,584
you must go back to the place
from which you started.

764
01:20:12,656 --> 01:20:15,181
<i>Go back, Joseph. </i>

765
01:20:15,259 --> 01:20:18,160
Go home.

766
01:21:21,926 --> 01:21:26,295
<i> Joseph? Joseph Thorne?</i>

767
01:22:07,738 --> 01:22:09,672
Dad?

768
01:22:25,689 --> 01:22:28,817
<i>I made brownies, Joseph, your favorite. </i>

769
01:22:46,010 --> 01:22:48,444
<i>You know why</i>
<i>I baked you brownies, Joe?</i>

770
01:22:48,512 --> 01:22:50,571
<i>'Cause you're</i>
<i>such a good boy. </i>

771
01:23:02,359 --> 01:23:05,658
I love you,
Joseph.

772
01:23:05,729 --> 01:23:10,393
We'll save some of these for your father
for when he wakes up from his nap.

773
01:23:16,874 --> 01:23:18,808
Mom?

774
01:24:09,593 --> 01:24:11,993
<i>Why don't you</i>
<i>visit us, Joe?</i>

775
01:24:12,062 --> 01:24:14,530
We never
see you anymore.

776
01:24:14,598 --> 01:24:17,624
- We don't like it here.
- Mom?

777
01:24:20,704 --> 01:24:22,171
Stop!

778
01:24:34,017 --> 01:24:35,951
Dad?

779
01:25:31,308 --> 01:25:33,276
Whatever you want,

780
01:25:33,343 --> 01:25:35,334
as many times
as you want it.

781
01:25:49,593 --> 01:25:52,585
<i>Help me!</i>

782
01:26:09,613 --> 01:26:11,547
I trusted you.

783
01:26:12,683 --> 01:26:14,810
Tony, I'm sorry.

784
01:26:19,423 --> 01:26:21,357
Tony, stop!

785
01:26:28,999 --> 01:26:31,058
I trusted you!

786
01:27:04,368 --> 01:27:07,462
That ain't right,
you treating me like this, Joe.

787
01:27:07,538 --> 01:27:11,440
<i>Bernie?</i>
<i>I'm sorry. I never</i>...

788
01:27:11,508 --> 01:27:14,033
What am I,
your whipping boy?

789
01:27:26,123 --> 01:27:28,455
<i>Help me!</i>

790
01:29:25,308 --> 01:29:27,242
You.

791
01:29:57,541 --> 01:30:00,271
Why?

792
01:30:02,846 --> 01:30:05,872
<i>It's all a puzzle, isn't it, Joseph?</i>

793
01:30:05,949 --> 01:30:08,213
<i>Like a game of chess,</i>
<i>perhaps. </i>

794
01:30:08,285 --> 01:30:10,913
The pieces move,
apparently aimlessly,

795
01:30:10,987 --> 01:30:15,083
but always towards
one single objective:

796
01:30:15,158 --> 01:30:18,252
To kill the king.

797
01:30:18,328 --> 01:30:21,229
Who is the king
in this game, Joseph?

798
01:30:21,298 --> 01:30:24,961
<i>That is the question</i>
<i>you must ask yourself. </i>

799
01:30:25,035 --> 01:30:28,835
Don't you recognize
your own flesh,

800
01:30:28,905 --> 01:30:31,806
your own spirit?

801
01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:35,744
I don't understand.

802
01:30:38,014 --> 01:30:40,983
the eternal refrain
of humanity...

803
01:30:41,051 --> 01:30:44,043
pleading ignorance,
begging for mercy.

804
01:30:44,121 --> 01:30:47,750
"Please, help me.
I don't understand. "

805
01:30:47,824 --> 01:30:51,885
<i>This is the life</i>
<i>you chose, Joseph. </i>

806
01:30:51,962 --> 01:30:53,896
<i>All the people</i>
<i>you hurt,</i>

807
01:30:53,964 --> 01:30:56,330
all the appetites
you indulged.

808
01:30:56,399 --> 01:30:59,562
<i>You have destroyed</i>
<i>your own innocence,</i>

809
01:30:59,636 --> 01:31:03,663
allowed your flesh
to consume your spirit.

810
01:31:05,242 --> 01:31:07,870
You are your own king,

811
01:31:07,944 --> 01:31:12,643
and this is the hell you
have created for yourself.

812
01:31:19,523 --> 01:31:21,457
No.

813
01:31:29,466 --> 01:31:33,129
Your flesh
is killing your spirit.

814
01:31:33,203 --> 01:31:36,366
No!

815
01:31:37,641 --> 01:31:39,871
Oh, yes, Joseph.

816
01:31:42,579 --> 01:31:45,275
You have forsaken
yourself.

817
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:59,456
Only one finger
left now, Joseph.

818
01:32:00,597 --> 01:32:03,589
<i>Only one more</i>
<i>death to go. </i>

819
01:32:22,385 --> 01:32:25,115
Welcome to hell.

820
01:33:25,849 --> 01:33:28,613
Jesus. Haven't I
earned my money yet?

821
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:32,454
I'm sorry.

822
01:34:12,629 --> 01:34:15,757
- <i>How'd you do?</i>
- What?

823
01:34:15,832 --> 01:34:18,426
The game last night. How'd you do?

824
01:34:18,501 --> 01:34:20,526
Well, we...

825
01:34:20,603 --> 01:34:23,800
We won by seven,
but it should've been 20.

826
01:34:23,873 --> 01:34:25,807
<i>Tony no-showed. </i>

827
01:34:25,875 --> 01:34:27,809
I had to go fishin'.

828
01:34:31,948 --> 01:34:33,973
Detective Thorne.

829
01:34:36,553 --> 01:34:39,454
Hey, Joe, it's Daphne.

830
01:34:39,522 --> 01:34:42,787
I'm the girl
you were with last night.

831
01:34:42,859 --> 01:34:46,090
Please!
I'm still at the motel.

832
01:34:46,162 --> 01:34:48,960
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.

833
01:34:49,032 --> 01:34:51,728
What's the matter, Joe?
You okay?

834
01:34:57,574 --> 01:34:59,565
No, don't do it!

835
01:35:19,396 --> 01:35:21,830
<i>I lived in a world of facts,</i>

836
01:35:21,898 --> 01:35:25,629
<i>of a reality that</i>
<i>I thought I understood. </i>

837
01:35:25,702 --> 01:35:28,296
<i>I believed I was</i>
<i>the center of the design... </i>

838
01:35:28,371 --> 01:35:31,135
<i>and I was certain</i>
<i>that I knew all the answers. </i>

839
01:35:32,976 --> 01:35:36,912
<i>But now I face the truth about</i>
<i>what I've done to hurt those around me,</i>

840
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:40,916
<i>and in hurting them,</i>
<i>what I've done to myself. </i>

841
01:35:44,054 --> 01:35:46,750
<i>I've confronted</i>
<i>my own demons,</i>

842
01:35:46,823 --> 01:35:50,224
<i>and now the only thing</i>
<i>I know for certain... </i>

843

844
01:35:55,698 --> 01:35:57,962
No!

845
01:35:59,936 --> 01:36:03,372
<i> ¤ Dreamed a world ¤</i>

846
