about the Comedian in it.

...with the premier of the U.S.S.R.

2217
03:12:55,429 --> 03:12:58,264
Putting aside our past differences...

2218
03:12:58,599 --> 03:13:00,768
...we have both pledged to unite...

2219
03:13:01,103 --> 03:13:04,438
...against this common enemy.

2220
03:13:04,940 --> 03:13:06,941
With the rest of the world...

2221
03:13:07,401 --> 03:13:09,402
...we will prevail.

2222
03:13:11,947 --> 03:13:14,949
This is a day we shall never forget.

2223
03:13:15,117 --> 03:13:19,329
And yet we go forward
to defend the human race...

2224
03:13:19,497 --> 03:13:24,126
...and all that is good
and just in our world.

2225
03:13:25,461 --> 03:13:29,715
Thank you. God bless us all.

2226
03:13:30,091 --> 03:13:31,883
ADRIAN:
Do you see?

2227
03:13:34,095 --> 03:13:36,556
Two superpowers retreating from war.

2228
03:13:38,142 --> 03:13:40,601
I've saved the earth from hell.

2229
03:13:40,769 --> 03:13:42,729
We both have.

2230
03:13:43,188 --> 03:13:45,398
This is as much your victory as it is mine.

2231
03:13:50,195 --> 03:13:51,697
Now we can return...

2232
03:13:53,116 --> 03:13:54,700
...do what we were meant to.

2233
03:13:54,951 --> 03:13:57,828
We were meant to exact justice.

2234
03:13:58,163 --> 03:14:01,498
-Everyone's gonna know what you've done.
-Will they?

2235
03:14:01,666 --> 03:14:06,462
By exposing me, you would sacrifice
the peace so many died for today.

2236
03:14:06,629 --> 03:14:10,091
-Peace based on a lie.
-But peace...

2237
03:14:10,259 --> 03:14:12,469
-...nonetheless.
-He's right.

2238
03:14:13,012 --> 03:14:16,973
Exposing Adrian would only doom the world
to nuclear destruction again.

2239
03:14:17,141 --> 03:14:20,018
No. We can't do this.

2240
03:14:20,186 --> 03:14:21,978
On Mars...

2241
03:14:23,481 --> 03:14:25,316
...you taught me the value of life.

2242
03:14:26,276 --> 03:14:28,694
If we hope to preserve it here...

2243
03:14:29,488 --> 03:14:31,530
...we must remain silent.

2244
03:14:35,368 --> 03:14:37,328
Keep your own secrets.

2245
03:14:44,170 --> 03:14:45,378
Don't even think about it.

2246
03:14:48,007 --> 03:14:49,716
Rorschach.

2247
03:14:51,511 --> 03:14:53,011
Wait.

2248
03:14:54,055 --> 03:14:56,181
Never compromise.

2249
03:14:56,516 --> 03:14:59,393
Not even in the face of armageddon.

2250
03:14:59,812 --> 03:15:02,814
That's always been the difference
between us, Daniel.

2251
03:15:13,867 --> 03:15:17,371
I've made myself feel every death...

2252
03:15:18,873 --> 03:15:24,753
...see every innocent face
I've murdered to save humanity.

2253
03:15:30,343 --> 03:15:34,055
-You understand, don't you?
JON: Without condoning...

2254
03:15:35,724 --> 03:15:37,600
...or condemning...

2255
03:15:42,022 --> 03:15:43,940
...I understand.

2256
03:15:51,366 --> 03:15:54,493
Out of my way. People have to be told.

2257
03:15:55,370 --> 03:15:57,288
You know I can't let you do that.

2258
03:15:58,540 --> 03:16:01,542
Suddenly you discover humanity?

2259
03:16:02,961 --> 03:16:04,795
Convenient.

2260
03:16:13,514 --> 03:16:18,101
If you'd cared from the start,
none of this would have happened.

2261
03:16:21,856 --> 03:16:24,817
I can change almost anything...

2262
03:16:29,406 --> 03:16:31,741
...but I can't change human nature.

2263
03:16:33,076 --> 03:16:36,454
Of course
you must protect Veidt's new utopia.

2264
03:16:37,748 --> 03:16:41,084
What's one more body
amongst foundations?

2265
03:16:47,258 --> 03:16:49,134
Well, what are you waiting for?

2266
03:16:52,597 --> 03:16:54,431
Do it.

2267
03:17:00,522 --> 03:17:01,564
Do it!

2268
03:17:04,276 --> 03:17:07,654
No!

2269
03:17:25,131 --> 03:17:30,887
JON: I'm leaving this galaxy
for one a little less complicated.

2270
03:17:31,055 --> 03:17:33,556
LAURIE: I thought you said you cared
about life again.

2271
03:17:33,724 --> 03:17:35,141
JON:
I do.

2272
03:17:36,477 --> 03:17:39,354
I think maybe I'll create some.

2273
03:17:43,484 --> 03:17:45,819
Goodbye, Laurie.

2274
03:18:05,717 --> 03:18:08,927
[DAN YELLING]

2275
03:18:21,066 --> 03:18:22,233
Come on.

2276
03:18:24,695 --> 03:18:26,279
Come on!

2277
03:18:30,701 --> 03:18:32,035
Dan...

2278
03:18:32,494 --> 03:18:35,246
...a world united and at peace.

2279
03:18:36,123 --> 03:18:37,332
There had to be sacrifice.

2280
03:18:37,500 --> 03:18:41,879
No! You haven't idealized mankind,
you've deformed it.

2281
03:18:42,047 --> 03:18:43,797
You've mutilated it.

2282
03:18:44,174 --> 03:18:46,342
That's your legacy.

2283
03:18:54,894 --> 03:18:57,687
That's the real practical joke.

2284
03:19:50,285 --> 03:19:54,288
MAN [ON TV]: We repeat, there is
nothing wrong with your television set.

2285
03:19:54,456 --> 03:19:57,917
You are about to participate
in a great adventure.

2286
03:19:58,085 --> 03:20:01,254
You are about to experience
the awe and mystery...

2287
03:20:01,422 --> 03:20:07,219
...which reaches from the inner mind
to the outer limits.

2288
03:20:08,430 --> 03:20:10,639
SALLY:
Sure you don't want a drink?

2289
03:20:11,641 --> 03:20:12,683
I'm okay.

2290
03:20:13,726 --> 03:20:14,977
Cheers.

2291
03:20:16,396 --> 03:20:19,524
There's something I need
to get off my chest.

2292
03:20:20,818 --> 03:20:23,319
I know that Eddie Blake was my father.

2293
03:20:26,323 --> 03:20:28,074
Laurel.

2294
03:20:29,076 --> 03:20:31,411
What you must think of me.

2295
03:20:32,246 --> 03:20:34,789
I'm sorry I never told you.

2296
03:20:34,957 --> 03:20:36,750
I should have...

2297
03:20:36,918 --> 03:20:41,046
...but I don't know, I just felt ashamed.
I felt stupid.

2298
03:20:41,214 --> 03:20:43,174
It doesn't matter.

2299
03:20:44,009 --> 03:20:49,263
People's lives take them strange places.
They do strange things...

2300
03:20:49,848 --> 03:20:52,767
...and, well,
sometimes they can't talk about them.

2301
03:20:52,935 --> 03:20:55,270
I know how that is...

2302
03:20:56,022 --> 03:20:58,607
...but I just want you to know...

2303
03:20:59,192 --> 03:21:02,027
...that you never did anything wrong
by me.

2304
03:21:06,199 --> 03:21:10,453
You asked me why I wasn't mad at him.

2305
03:21:12,039 --> 03:21:14,540
Because he gave me you.

2306
03:21:19,546 --> 03:21:20,630
Thanks, Mom.

2307
03:21:23,383 --> 03:21:25,176
I love you.

2308
03:21:32,727 --> 03:21:36,939
-Hello, Miss Jupiter.
-Oh, Sally, please.

2309
03:21:38,566 --> 03:21:43,154
Excuse me. Gotta go freshen up.
I'll be right back.

2310
03:21:53,666 --> 03:21:57,835
-So how's it going up here?
-Good. How's it going down there?

2311
03:21:58,003 --> 03:22:01,507
Good. I think I've got everything working.

2312
03:22:01,675 --> 03:22:06,303
All of Archie's systems are upgraded.
Finished the tinkering for now...

2313
03:22:06,471 --> 03:22:08,722
...so all we gotta do is take her out.

2314
03:22:08,890 --> 03:22:11,976
Well, that sounds like a date.

2315
03:22:23,281 --> 03:22:25,532
Are we gonna be all right?

2316
03:22:27,618 --> 03:22:31,913
Long as people think Jon's
still watching us, we'll be all right...

2317
03:22:32,123 --> 03:22:34,000
...in the end.

2318
03:22:35,627 --> 03:22:37,795
I know what Jon would say:

2319
03:22:37,963 --> 03:22:40,006
Nothing ends.

2320
03:22:41,883 --> 03:22:44,510
Nothing ever ends.

2321
03:23:31,853 --> 03:23:35,606
Seymour, we got nothing
to write about anymore.

2322
03:23:35,774 --> 03:23:37,149
Everyone in the country...

2323
03:23:37,317 --> 03:23:39,568
...every country in the world
are holding hands...

2324
03:23:39,736 --> 03:23:43,031
...and singing songs
about peace and love.

2325
03:23:43,532 --> 03:23:46,409
It's like living in a goddamn
global hippie commune.

2326
03:23:46,577 --> 03:23:50,497
Well, Ronald Reagan says he's gonna
be running for president in '88.

2327
03:23:50,665 --> 03:23:52,499
We could run a piece on that.

2328
03:23:52,667 --> 03:23:55,835
Seymour, we don't dignify absurdities
with coverage.

2329
03:23:56,003 --> 03:23:59,840
This is still America, damn it.
Who wants a cowboy in the White House?

2330
03:24:00,592 --> 03:24:04,804
Okay. I could look for something
in the crank file.

2331
03:24:04,971 --> 03:24:06,597
Crank file.

2332
03:24:06,765 --> 03:24:08,766
Whatever. Take some initiative.

2333
03:24:08,934 --> 03:24:11,560
Run whatever you like.
I leave it entirely in your hands.

2334

Rorschach's journal, October 12th, 1985.

2335
03:24:22,949 --> 03:24:27,411
Tonight, a comedian died in New York.
