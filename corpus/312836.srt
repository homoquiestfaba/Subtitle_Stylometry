1
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:39,623
Hello, my name is Violet...

2
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:45,958
...and I was born into a world
you may not understand.

3
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,109
Coming up. Holding airspeed.

4
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,575
Echo altitude.
Forward and lateral drift.

5
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,714
Numbers falling fast from here.

6
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:07,410
On my mark.
Three, two, one, mark.

7
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,911
Time lock engaged.

8
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,837
Valves, primary and secondary--

9
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,246
Compositive pressure reached.

10
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,511
Five--

11
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,265
-Freeze!
-lt's a trap.

12
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,703
Stay where you are! Don't move!

13
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,845
The man's down. All clear, sir.

14
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,916
Touch nothing, obviously.

15
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,454
Do not leave the building.
Squadrons...

16
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,389
...initiate Area 1 4 procedures.

17
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:59,053
-Hemophages.
-No surprise.

18
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,802
Flat-space technology.

19
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,666
Dimension-compressing. Very rare.

20
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,768
lt's odd.
What was their exit strategy?

21
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,776
How'd they expect to transport
the blood out of here?

22
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:16,176
-Unless there was no exit strategy.
-Then what's the point?

23
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,978
What if they didn't come to take blood?
What if they came to infect it?

24
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,020
My God. Cross.

25
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,194
Poor bastard.

26
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:38,501
Yes, I was born into a world
you might not understand.

27
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,798
The trouble began when
an American weapons lab...

28
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:43,464
...discovered an obscure virus
in Eastern Europe...

29
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,474
...that had been around
for centuries.

30
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:49,407
They tried to modify it to create
faster and stronger soldiers.

31
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:54,815
Instead, they created a more
contagious form of the disease...

32
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:59,481
...a strain called HGV,
Hemoglophagic Virus.

33
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:03,920
And what do you know,
the disease got out.

34
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,066
And that's when
everything changed.

35
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,235
As previous ages
were defined by terrorism...

36
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:14,999
...this one was defined
by a fear of disease.

37
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:19,643
Because one of the side effects
of the disease was longer teeth...

38
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:22,406
...the media decided
to call it vampirism.

39
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,777
I guess it sold more papers.

40
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:28,818
The medical establishment took it
upon itself to protect its public.

41
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:32,480
At first, requiring victims to wear
identifying armbands.

42
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:37,789
Then rounding them up
in special camps and facilities.

43
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:42,597
Until finally, people just
stopped hearing from them.

44
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:47,462
The day the trouble began for me
was the day I learned I was pregnant.

45
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,278
Violet, my God.

46
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,276
The same day I lost my husband...

47
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,475
...my future, my life.

48
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:05,220
And I, too, disappeared deep inside
a faceless camp...

49
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:10,294
...subjected to the indignity of
a forced life of endless examination...

50
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:14,126
...dissection, experimentation.

51
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:20,067
Like others, the disease started to
progressively change me physically.

52
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:25,800
My eyesight was sharper.
My hearing, more acute.

53
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:29,277
Bones, stronger. Healing faster.

54
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,112
Life span, shorter. A lot shorter.

55
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,585
Twelve years, maximum,
infection to death.

56
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:41,386
Unlike others, I converted with only
a mild sensitivity to light.

57
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:44,621
Like others, however,
I required frequent transfusions...

58
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,357
...and it didn't help
that I was pregnant.

59
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,400
And, no, we weren't superhuman.

60
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,233
Though we were a lot faster and
a lot stronger than everyone else...

61
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:57,205
...we die just like everyone else.

62
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:01,870
And just like everyone else,
without help, we stayed dead.

63
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:07,082
And though I was resuscitated back
to life for further experimentation...

64
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:12,486
...the one I'd carried inside me
for nearly nine months, my baby...

65
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,626
...wasn't so lucky.

66
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,853
Those few still on the outside...

67
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:20,988
...embraced the slur bestowed
upon them, ''vampires''...

68
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,828
...formed a resistance...

69
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,867
...went underground...

70
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,028
...and began fighting back.

71
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,033
And so began...

72
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:35,343
...the Blood Wars.

73
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,513
And now, the leader of the militant,
medical establishment...

74
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,483
...running this phobic world...

75
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:46,250
...is Vice-Cardinal
Ferdinand Daxus.

76
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,357
-Vice-cardinal.
-As you know...

77
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,428
...our campaign against
the Hemophages...

78
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:51,893
...has been highly effective.

79
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:54,123
We've managed to eradicate
almost all of them.

80
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,031
But, sir, the few that are left
have proven incredibly determined.

81
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,468
Terrorist attacks are at their
highest level ever.

82
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:04,567
lt's not because they're determined.
lt's because they're desperate.

83
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:08,874
Because they know we're on the verge
of wiping them out completely.

84
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,276
For the last 1 0 years...

85
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:13,418
...in partnership with
Laboratories for Latter Day Defense...

86
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,520
...l've overseen the development
a weapon...

87
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:19,215
...that can locate and kill every
Hemophage on the planet in days.

88
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,293
-ls there an ETA, sir?
-Now.

89
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:29,167
A courier is retrieving it to bring here
to the Archministry as we speak.

90
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:54,956
XPD-1 54.
Clearance, classified courier.

91
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:57,186
l'm expected.

92
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:01,899
Reverse-engineer DNA
identification in process.

93
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,592
Remove your head-covering.

94
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,571
Remove your eye-covering.

95
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,524
Preliminary verification
substantiated.

96
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,145
Please...

97
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,743
...have a seat.

98
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,830
-Mind if l ask what's on the menu?
-The usual.

99
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:15,236
Retinal testing to detect
the presence of contacts or dyes.

100
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,740
Metabolic sensing to make
certain your metabolism...

101
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,605
...is within human range.

102
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,043
Pulse, respiration.

103
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:25,240
Just have to make sure
you're human.

104
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:35,755
lf you were a Hemophage...

105
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:39,955
...we'd already have detected tissue
repair at a microcellular level.

106
00:11:55,815 --> 00:12:00,081
So, what would happen if one
were to fail any of these tests?

107
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,480
Nothing good.

108
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:05,920
Please remove all articles of clothing
and proceed into the scanner.

109
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:38,253
Your clothing and personal items
have been sterilized, XPD-1 54.

110
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,002
-May l ask you a question?
-Feel free.

111
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,631
-Do you know what this is about?
-Should l?

112
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,942
No, it's highly classified.

113
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,667
l've been cleared to debrief you...

114
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,277
...because your consciousness...

115
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:04,143
...of the gravity of this situation may
increase your motivation to complete.

116
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:08,149
l've never failed to complete.

117
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:13,616
The Hemophages are a dying species
on the verge of nonexistence.

118
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,055
We've developed a weapon...

119
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,695
...that will push them
past that brink, into extinction.

120
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,330
lf this weapon's so important...

121
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,693
...why not have it delivered
by armored convoy?

122
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:24,233
The convoy you refer
to is departing as we speak.

123
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,701
The Hemophages will do anything in
their power to stop and immobilize it.

124
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:30,034
lt is, of course, a decoy.

125
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:34,145
XPD-1 54, you'll be receiving
a case containing a weapon.

126
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,137
l don't have to tell you.

127
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,011
Under no circumstances
should you open it.

128
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,982
You're right.

129
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,850
You don't have to tell me.

130
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,186
Identify.

131
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:56,298
XPD-1 54.
Clearance, classified courier.

132
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,261
Copy, XPD- 1 54.
We've been expecting.

133
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:17,051
Everything in order, XPD-1 54?

134
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,754
One hundred percent,
comrade doctor.

135
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,093
You're quite certain
everything is in order?

136
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:56,583
Positively.

137
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,394
Enter your DNA to confirm receipt.

138
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:03,630
l can only confirm receipt of
the container, not its contents.

139
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:06,032
That's acceptable.

140
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,442
Opening the case is strictly forbidden.
You understand this?

141
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,172
Perfectly.

142
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:23,754
The contents are set to self-destruct
in event of non-delivery...

143
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,449
...in exactly nine hours from now.

144
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:44,206
What is your condition, XPD-1 54?
Are you functional?

145
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:57,181
XPD-1 54.
Clearance, classified courier.

146
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,290
-Get on the ground!
-On your knees!

147
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,857
-Get down!
-What is going on?

148
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:03,494
You were entered
and processed 1 5 minutes ago.

149
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,755
Then it wasn't me,
you dumb son of a bitch.

150
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,126
Check my lD. You've got a mite.

151
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,903
l repeat, XPD-1 54,
are you functional?

152
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:16,473
l don't know what you're talking about.
l'm 1 00 percent functional.

153
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,038
Security breach! Security breach!

154
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:22,577
Stage yellow alert!
Stage yellow alert!

155
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,483
Intercept, intercept.
Inner defense vault.

156
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,352
Unarmed intruder!
Unarmed intruder!

157
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:56,866
Facility infiltration.
All security forces at stations.

158
00:17:57,042 --> 00:18:00,534
All security forces at stations.
Facility infiltration.

159
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,145
All security forces at stations.

160
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,145
How did a Hemophage
get past the screens?

161
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:07,911
Don't know. Maybe meta-suppressants
to subordinate blood characteristics.

162
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:13,389
All security forces at stations.

163
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,188
Facility infiltration.
All security forces at stations.

164
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:20,195
All security forces at stations.

165
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,426
-How did she do that?
-She must have...

166
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,028
...some sort
of gravity leveler.

167
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,629
Whatever it is, it's ours now.

168
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,459
She's not going to make it out alive.

169
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,894
Sir, we've ID'd her.
Plague victim.

170
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,561
She was confined to this facility
for experimentation...

171
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:01,933
...until she escaped...

172
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:05,099
...after the forced termination
of her pregnancy 1 2 years ago.

173
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,340
Violet Song jat Shariff.
Tell me I'm wrong.

174
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:11,005
-You're wrong.
-Why are you doing this?

175
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:15,715
Because l hate humans
with every fiber of my being...

176
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,686
...and l'll kill every
single one of them...

177
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,052
...almost as quickly
as they'll try and kill me.

178
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:24,161
-You used to be human.
-But not anymore, right?

179
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,695
l got sick, and now
l'm something less than human.

180
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:29,561
Something worthy of extermination.

181
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,032
It's academic now, isn't it?

182
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,967
You won't make it out of here
with that case.

183
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:35,367
Watch me.

184
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:52,021
-She's on the ceiling!
-Shoot! Shoot!

185
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:06,127
-lt's me.
-Did you get it?

186
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:07,765
Yeah.

187
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,460
But they're serious about
not letting me keep it.

188
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:14,094
Fine. The objective is
the destruction of the weapon.

189
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,003
If you can't make delivery,
destroy it.

190
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:19,609
Copy that. Will determine
nature and destroy.

191
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,144
No, V. The attack on
the blood bank failed.

192
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:23,576
You cannot.

193
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:26,582
Under no circumstances can you
look inside that case.

194
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,949
If you are compromised,
you must destroy it immediately.

195
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,181
-Read?
-Read.

196
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:31,032
Oh, shit.

197
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:29,260
-lt's me.
-3-D me.

198
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,162
-Are you clear?
-Negative. They're everywhere.

199
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,808
-l don't know if l can make it.
-You're carrying the bomb?

200
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,740
-Of course.
-Then detonate it. Now.

201
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,506
lt'll level the entire block.

202
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:47,580
May l suggest an alternative?
Open the case and use the weapon.

203
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:52,519
Negative. Do not open that case, V.
Detonate right now.

204
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,586
Nerva, listen.
You know it doesn't matter to me.

205
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,728
l'll be dead in 36 hours,
no matter what.

206
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:00,729
But every human for a quarter mile
doesn't have to die with me.

207
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,924
l'm telling you
this is not subject to debate.

208
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:05,569
The entire fate of our race
is tied up in that case.

209
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:10,674
Detonate the bomb, destroy the case,
destroy everything. Now.

210
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,204
What about the Archministry?

211
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,143
Goodbye, V.

212
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:20,675
V, l said goodbye.

213
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,646
Yeah.

214
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,458
Goodbye.

215
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:00,090
We got her. We got visual.

216
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,757
-Third quadrant.
-She's in the crowd.

217
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:04,828
Stay on her.

218
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:14,431
lt's not her. Go! Go, go!

219
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:18,071
-Seal all quadrant.
-Check it out.

220
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:33,689
-V, what the hell is going on?
-l'm clear.

221
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:36,622
l told you to destroy the weapon.

222
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,126
l said, l'm clear.

223
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:41,560
You have the case?

224
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,293
-Affirmative.
-Bring it in.

225
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:49,131
-What's your status?
-The Needle. ln the Chinois Gau.

226
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,600
Ten minutes.

227
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,528
Bravo, V. Bravo.

228
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:54,187
No one but you
could have pulled this off.

229
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,094
lt's not a weapon.

230
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:57,757
What are you talking about?

231
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:01,133
lt's not a weapon. lt's a child.
A human child.

232
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,274
You opened the case.

233
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:07,878
What difference does it make?
l risked my life for nothing.

234
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,451
l think l had to know
what l was willing to die for.

235
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:27,186
-You see? Nothing.
-Nothing.

236
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:30,129
lt's not a weapon. lt's a child.

237
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:34,260
lt's both.
lt's a weapon and a child.

238
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,567
lts blood is swarming with
cultured antigens...

239
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:40,609
...that would kill all of us on contact.

240
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,172
lf they atomize its tissues
into the atmosphere...

241
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:48,376
...it would be like insecticide
to people like you and me.

242
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:52,216
lt would find us,
and it would kill us.

243
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,448
All of us.

244
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:59,057
Nerva, wait. lf there's an accelerator
for HGV in this child's blood...

245
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,630
....then so is the counter-analog
for decelerating it.

246
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,328
What are you saying, V?

247
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,766
A cure?

248
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:10,372
Wouldn't it be better than
infecting innocent people?

249
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,275
This child could provide the choice.

250
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:16,436
lf there's a choice, V,
l've already made it.

251
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,517
lt's a child.

252
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,454
You can go now. Your work is done.

253
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:46,710
lt was a projection.

254
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,606
Don't over-think it.
Just turns out l was right.

255
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,374
We're getting the hell out of here.

256
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:06,187
-She went up.
-So go after her.

257
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:09,299
The Blood Chinois control
the top 1 0 floors of this building.

258
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:13,003
Whatever they want, give it to them.

259
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:51,103
You're not Archministry.

260
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:54,335
You're not even vampire....

261
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:57,275
You're Blood Chinois.

262
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:59,116
Let me pass.

263
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,381
Sorry, Violet. Can't do.

264
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:05,253
You're going to lose resources, Kar.

265
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:09,015
Can't be helped.

266
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:13,790
But l don't think you're
going to make it off this roof.

267
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,197
Watch me.

268
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:41,811
Hey.

269
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:46,013
What are you doing up there, huh?

270
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:49,683
Hey.

271
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,251
lt's a nice view, huh?

272
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:59,224
Why don't you...

273
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:03,060
...help me up
so l can see it too.

274
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:08,365
Here. Give me your hand.

275
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:14,344
Give me your hand.

276
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:16,104
Help me up. Come on.

277
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,614
lt's okay.

278
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,690
Come here.

279
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:35,924
What do you think you're doing?
You trying to get yourself killed?

280
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:39,060
Come on.

281
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,262
Stop it. Seal the building.

282
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:12,630
Any other Phages inside,
l want them hunted down and killed.

283
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:15,568
Violet Song jat Shariff.

284
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,937
Seal the Needle. Hunt down
and kill any Hemophages inside.

285
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,907
Easy, Violet.

286
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:24,172
-Do you know who l am?
-How could l not?

287
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:29,012
Tyrant. Egomaniac.
Narcissist.

288
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,712
That about sums it up,
doesn't it?

289
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:36,326
Yes, it may be true.
l may have quirks.

290
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:37,961
But that doesn't mean l'm stupid.

291
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:40,654
And it certainly doesn't mean
that you make a single move...

292
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,355
...without me knowing about it.

293
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,296
You would've killed me
a long time ago.

294
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,136
Listen, the boy is useless to you.

295
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:51,537
He's laboratory-bred,
vegetative, practically brain-dead.

296
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,542
Just give him to me,
and you're on your way.

297
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:58,341
And then you can use him to kill me
and everybody like me.

298
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:01,174
He's not what you think.

299
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:02,876
No?

300
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,578
What is he then?

301
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:08,920
He's my son.

302
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,067
-Hey, Daxus?
-What?

303
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:23,030
You're full of shit.

304
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:30,405
Cover your ears.
Cover your ears!

305
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,383
Metro Five is boarding.

306
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:43,118
Stand clear. Doors closing.

307
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:50,025
Damaged? Are you damaged?

308
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,419
What am l doing?

309
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,993
Hey!

310
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,396
Park it. Right there.

311
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:31,165
Don't make me have
to tell you twice. Sit.

312
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:46,279
Don't get any cute ideas either.

313
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:48,283
The only reason l saved your life...

314
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:52,851
...is because whatever is
in your blood can save mine.

315
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:56,329
lf they corner us,
suffer no delusions...

316
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,263
...l will kill you.

317
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,042
-S Squadron entering station.
-Damn it!

318
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:12,842
Will detain and search train.

319
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,815
Metro Five is boarding.

320
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:30,363
Just stick close.
l know somebody that can help.

321
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,039
Hello?

322
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:48,979
Hey, remember me?

323
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,984
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?

324
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:56,058
These people will kill you
without even thinking.

325
00:39:56,227 --> 00:40:00,061
ln fact, they have thought about it, and
that's exactly what they intend to do.

326
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,859
So l suggest you straighten up
before your actions...

327
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:06,002
...start to impact my ability to survive.

328
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,270
Look...

329
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:20,080
...l'm just trying to do
what's good for you, okay?

330
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,886
But you gotta stick by me.

331
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,788
Stick by me.

332
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:40,970
Garth, it's me.

333
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:43,265
l screwed up.
l screwed up bad.

334
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:46,104
The case had a kid in it.

335
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,810
-l crossed Nerva.
-I know. He called.

336
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:51,072
Don't even think about
bringing it here, V.

337
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:53,375
Damn it, this kid might have
the answer in him.

338
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:56,543
Now, l'm just gonna be lucky
to get him out of here alive.

339
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:01,191
-l need your help.
-I'm sorry, V.

340
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:05,226
My research is too important
to jeopardize for a single child.

341
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:06,926
Goodbye, V.

342
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:22,570
What part of those bullets whizzing
by your head didn't you get?

343
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:27,945
Do you understand anything
l'm saying to you?

344
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:34,719
Okay, let's start simple.

345
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:38,017
They had to call you something, right?
You have a name?

346
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:40,925
l'm Violet.
Hi, pleased to meet you.

347
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:42,463
Your turn. Go.

348
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,476
Six?

349
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:00,545
You?

350
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:05,451
We gotta go.

351
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,324
Damn it.

352
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,458
Give me your arm.

353
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,197
Give me your arm.

354
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,673
Now, you listen to me, Six,
or whatever your name is...

355
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:27,436
...l might not be able to get you
where l want to go...

356
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:29,169
...but l'll get your blood there.

357
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:31,405
Give me your arm before
l take the whole thing.

358
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:37,679
You think those people are bad?
Well, let me tell you something.

359
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:42,053
The real monster you don't want
knocking down your door is me.

360
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:45,154
lf l scream...

361
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:48,431
...we'll both be dead.

362
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:05,077
Daxus doesn't know
you can speak, does he?

363
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:10,282
What do you know
about what's going on?

364
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:15,886
There's a war going on
to the death...

365
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,960
...between humans
and Hemophages.

366
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:21,222
And, Six, you're a human.

367
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,959
And l'm a Hemophage.

368
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:27,231
Wait.

369
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:28,871
Listen, do you remember l said...

370
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,735
...there was something in
your blood that could save my life?

371
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,968
Well, Daxus, he put something
into your blood.

372
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:36,510
He grew something there.

373
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,240
And whatever that is,
those antigens...

374
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:41,407
...they may hold the key
to saving my life...

375
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:44,748
...but they were put there
first and foremost to kill me.

376
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:48,119
To kill me and everyone like me.

377
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:51,725
So these men...?

378
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:54,759
Yeah, Six.

379
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,394
They're after you.

380
00:43:57,267 --> 00:44:01,897
Right now, you're the most
valuable object on this planet.

381
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,073
Unbelievable, V.

382
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,237
You jeopardize
everything by coming here.

383
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:15,412
The humans want me.
Nerva wants me.

384
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,984
l don't have any place
left to go, Garth.

385
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:22,082
Besides...

386
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:24,817
...you have all my guns.

387
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:30,262
So, what's his story?

388
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:35,127
You tell me.

389
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:00,727
Can you make an assessment?

390
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:04,299
l'll need to draw some blood.
lt'll take a few hours.

391
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:20,978
Sweeper Team A,
inform Archminister Daxus...

392
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:24,245
...we have the remaining Hemophages
cornered on the 2 1 st floor.

393
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:29,284
-They're right behind me.
-The lights.

394
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:40,902
Go night-vision. Take them apart.

395
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:48,573
Switching to emergency
backup lighting system.

396
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:37,486
So...

397
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:39,828
...are you going to kill me?

398
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:50,164
Think you can?

399
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:23,665
l think you and l have matters
of mutual self-interest to discuss.

400
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:41,417
Sit down.

401
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:50,798
Humans are celebrating something.

402
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:08,042
Where is this?

403
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,058
When l was a kid...

404
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:17,822
...when l was just a little girl...

405
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:22,764
...l used to dream
about this old, dusty road.

406
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:28,503
And this road would go on
as far as the eye could see.

407
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:35,204
There was all these little white flowers
growing around the edges.

408
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:38,815
And it was such a peaceful place.

409
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:42,379
lt was a happy place.

410
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:45,717
But then you realize...

411
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:48,255
...when life settles in around you...

412
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:52,591
...places like this don't exist.

413
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:03,996
You're dying.

414
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,804
Yeah.

415
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:09,536
l am.

416
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:16,146
l'm sorry.

417
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:23,920
Do you read Thaihindi?

418
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:28,857
All right. Look.

419
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:36,030
''Comrade.''

420
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:40,400
''Lover.''

421
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:45,874
''Wife.''

422
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:50,443
And this one....

423
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:53,145
This one was
gonna say ''mother''...

424
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:56,759
...but l got sick...

425
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:01,329
...and all that
became impossible.

426
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:42,160
You're not looking so good.

427
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:44,034
l need to transfuse you.

428
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:48,143
Just be thankful you didn't convert
with light sensitivity too.

429
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:58,448
You do this?

430
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:03,222
-What is it?
-l'm not sure.

431
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:06,089
lt looks chemical...

432
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:09,494
...but it seems to be done in the
pre-collapse form of Western notation.

433
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:12,190
lt was probably him.

434
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:15,399
What is he?

435
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:17,863
l know what he's not.

436
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:21,636
He's not someone who has
a single molecule...

437
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:25,509
...of vampiral antigen in his blood.
That's what he's not.

438
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:28,708
He's not someone
who's any good to us.

439
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:31,820
We can't reverse-engineer
a cure out of his blood.

440
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:34,855
-What?
-lf that's not bad enough, the kid's hot.

441
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:36,583
Practically radioactive.

442
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,355
He's got a tracking device in him
that's accurate to about 1 00 meters.

443
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,589
We're shielded in here.

444
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,227
l don't understand.

445
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:47,927
Why would Nerva
want me to get him so badly?

446
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,369
And why were the humans
guarding him so closely?

447
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,303
l don't know.

448
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:57,443
But whatever they did put in the kid,
Violet, it's killing him.

449
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:00,673
Some kind of aggressive,
antagonistic protein.

450
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:03,752
Very predictable decay.

451
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,115
He's got a shelf life
of about eight hours.

452
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:11,118
The kid's toast, V.

453
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,946
Why are you doing this?
He's just a child.

454
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:40,282
lt's a human child, Garth.

455
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:43,756
And besides, what you're doing here
is too valuable to jeopardize.

456
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:47,353
Goodbye, Garth.

457
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:51,761
You've got a tracking device in you.

458
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:55,632
We've got to get moving
before it locks on. Come on.

459
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:12,312
Daxus. My phone number changes
every 60 seconds.

460
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:22,262
Disposable phone printing.
Thank you.

461
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:28,498
Garth, it's me.

462
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:31,163
They've been tracking my phone.
You better get moving.

463
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:34,002
-Okay.
-Violet.

464
00:53:34,678 --> 00:53:36,669
Maybe it's me.

465
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:39,910
Come on.

466
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:51,558
Violet, wait.
What are we doing?

467
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:58,190
l would be neglecting my duties...

468
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:00,495
...if l didn't get a growing boy fed,
wouldn't l?

469
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:05,670
Credit card. All right,
so you take this over there...

470
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:08,743
...and see if you can't find us
something to eat.

471
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,179
Go on.

472
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:27,462
Six.

473
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,499
You should really...

474
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:35,602
...put your mask up.

475
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:41,065
Goodbye, Violet.

476
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:14,641
-lt's urgent.
-Response team moving out.

477
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:17,878
Alpha Squad, Alpha Squad.

478
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:33,585
Alpha Squad, we have visual.

479
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:52,342
What am I doing?

480
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,516
lt's not him.

481
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:31,643
-Secure lockdown.
-Initiate area-quarantine procedures.

482
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:45,966
Six.

483
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:49,261
Wait.

484
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:51,931
Six!

485
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:53,405
Sorry, V.

486
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:21,268
Violet Song jat Shariff.

487
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,429
What are you thinking?

488
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:25,972
We're not Blood Chinois.

489
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:35,245
We're as fast as you.
We're as strong as you.

490
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:37,079
Yeah.

491
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:39,719
But...

492
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,191
...are you one-tenth
as pissed off as l am?

493
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:23,526
Careful, V.

494
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,029
Gunfire will attract
the human security teams.

495
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:31,605
You might win the battle,
but you'd lose the war, V.

496
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,343
V, wait.

497
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:44,047
Don't you realize
what this child has in him?

498
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:47,053
l don't care
what this child has in him.

499
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:52,661
lt's not a vampiral antigen,
but a human antigen.

500
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:56,060
Lethal enough to kill
every human on the planet.

501
00:58:58,334 --> 00:59:00,598
Why would humans create
a human antigen?

502
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:03,933
What do l, or even you, care why?

503
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:07,634
Daxus has offered us
a most tempting proposal.

504
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:10,677
One that would finally
even the odds for us.

505
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:12,747
So just walk away, V.

506
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:16,010
Walk away.

507
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:53,916
Are you insane?

508
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:57,651
You won't drop him.
You need him more than l do.

509
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:00,123
End her.

510
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:19,363
What did they put in me, Violet?

511
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:30,915
Don't you see?

512
01:01:32,088 --> 01:01:37,287
That mechanism Daxus,
your father, put inside you...

513
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:43,194
...it's an antagonistic protein.
lt's very precise.

514
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:48,703
And it's gonna shut you down, Six.

515
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:53,404
lt's gonna kill you, Six.

516
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:55,841
lf l don't find some way....

517
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:57,775
lf l don't find some....

518
01:01:57,947 --> 01:02:00,916
l just need some time.
l just need....

519
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:10,218
-Hello, Violet.
-3-D me.

520
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:14,226
This is a surprise.

521
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:17,230
l want you to take out
whatever you put in the kid.

522
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,892
Oh, l wish that was possible,
but there is no cure for the antigen.

523
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,971
-l don't believe you.
-Just bring him to me.

524
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:25,573
The antigen dies with the boy...

525
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:28,210
...and neither of them are
any good to anybody.

526
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:31,744
You said you were his father,
for God's sake.

527
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,779
No, Violet.

528
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:37,041
l don't have a father.

529
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,820
No, more precisely...

530
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:44,454
...he's my clone.

531
01:02:44,627 --> 01:02:46,356
Number six in a series of eight.

532
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:50,921
What the hell difference does it make?
He's a child, you monster.

533
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,624
Monster?

534
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:54,736
And what are you?

535
01:02:54,904 --> 01:02:57,498
And more importantly,
what does that make him to you?

536
01:02:57,673 --> 01:03:02,372
Some sort of bizarre,
maternal surrogate?

537
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:07,549
A vampire and a dying human child.

538
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:10,117
What a pathetic picture.

539
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:14,052
l'll make you another, Violet.
One that's not broken.

540
01:03:14,223 --> 01:03:16,783
You won't even be able
to tell the difference. l promise.

541
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:20,986
And l may even be able to help you
with that problem in your own blood.

542
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,394
-Trace.
-Why track the call?

543
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:27,297
l'll tell you where l am.
l want you to bring me the boy.

544
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:30,303
l'll bring you a lot more than that,
you prick.

545
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:34,271
l have 700 soldiers here with me.

546
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:38,174
What do you really think
you could do against that many men?

547
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:41,884
l can kill them.

548
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:49,650
Archministry.
Let's go meet your maker.

549
01:03:57,133 --> 01:03:59,693
Auto-guide on.

550
01:04:09,645 --> 01:04:11,044
You can't make it in.

551
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:14,843
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

552
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:19,714
Haven't you been paying attention?

553
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:22,688
Killing is what l do.

554
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:25,227
lt's what l'm good at.

555
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:31,131
l am a titan.

556
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:34,395
A monolith.

557
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:37,934
Nothing can stop me.

558
01:04:40,676 --> 01:04:41,904
l can see it.

559
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,914
What the hell choice do l have?

560
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,344
A very clear one.

561
01:04:51,587 --> 01:04:52,849
To watch me die.

562
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,749
Or make me...

563
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:58,952
...watch you do the same.

564
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:30,084
-Are you mental?
-The antidote.

565
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:34,628
l told you, there is no cure.

566
01:05:34,797 --> 01:05:37,197
You wouldn't create an antigen
without an antidote...

567
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:39,891
...you could administer to yourself
and your manciples.

568
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:43,364
Very nice, Violet.

569
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:45,166
Well, yes, there is an antidote.

570
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:46,774
And, yes, when l get the boy...

571
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,707
...l isolate the antigen
and release it into the atmosphere.

572
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:53,679
Anyone who wants to live will
queue up daily at this door to get it.

573
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:56,113
l thought we were
the ones you hated.

574
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:58,719
l thought we were the ones
you were trying to wipe out.

575
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:01,823
That's the problem.
You were. Past tense.

576
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:05,358
But now that you and those like you
are all but extinct...

577
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:07,928
...what's someone like me--
Someone with a job to do.

578
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:10,292
--going to use
to keep order in a society...

579
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:14,197
...that, left to itself, would sprint
toward chaos like an Olympic event?

580
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:16,299
We did our job too well.

581
01:06:17,173 --> 01:06:19,835
Now, must we make amends.

582
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:22,233
You disgust me.

583
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:26,706
lt's a relative term, Violet.
Give me what l want.

584
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:29,347
Come and get it.

585
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,329
You won't have him.

586
01:06:54,543 --> 01:06:56,408
Projection disruption.

587
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:12,721
There's just too many, V.

588
01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:17,366
Just too many.

589
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:02,143
Six.

590
01:08:05,047 --> 01:08:07,106
-Violet.
-l'm here. l'm here.

591
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:16,021
What's that sound, V?

592
01:08:17,059 --> 01:08:19,493
V, what's that sound?

593
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:23,398
lt's just the wind.

594
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:27,102
lt's just the wind.

595
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:04,504
Too late. He's gone.

596
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:06,903
Quarantine the corpse.
Get it to the Archministry.

597
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:09,177
Maybe we can salvage
something out of it.

598
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:11,370
And her, sir?

599
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:30,565
Have an incendiary team sanitize
the area immediately.

600
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:34,728
-All personnel, clear the area.
-Get the body on ice.

601
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:36,633
Prepare it for disassembly.

602
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:39,501
-We'll go in for salvage at daybreak.
-Yes, doctor.

603
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:43,372
All personnel,
clear the area immediately.

604
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:45,239
Violet.

605
01:09:47,248 --> 01:09:48,875
Violet.

606
01:09:50,518 --> 01:09:52,042
Violet.

607
01:09:56,223 --> 01:09:57,815
Violet.

608
01:10:03,264 --> 01:10:04,390
Garth?

609
01:10:05,266 --> 01:10:08,201
We very thoughtfully subbed in
for the incendiary team.

610
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:11,060
Your heart stopped three times...

611
01:10:11,238 --> 01:10:15,265
...but after four hours of surgery
and a lot of prayer...

612
01:10:15,443 --> 01:10:17,138
...we managed to save your life.

613
01:10:19,013 --> 01:10:20,742
You what?

614
01:10:25,953 --> 01:10:27,181
Careful.

615
01:10:30,024 --> 01:10:33,482
l was there, Garth. l was there.

616
01:10:34,929 --> 01:10:37,261
You brought me back?

617
01:10:37,798 --> 01:10:39,766
For what?

618
01:10:39,934 --> 01:10:43,097
So l could do it all over again?

619
01:10:44,205 --> 01:10:47,106
Why? Why?

620
01:10:48,075 --> 01:10:49,838
lsn't it...?

621
01:10:51,045 --> 01:10:53,240
lsn't it obvious?

622
01:11:02,757 --> 01:11:04,622
Why won't you ever let anyone in?

623
01:11:06,594 --> 01:11:08,357
Because...

624
01:11:10,965 --> 01:11:12,899
...these moments...

625
01:11:14,401 --> 01:11:16,767
...as beautiful as they are...

626
01:11:18,139 --> 01:11:20,198
...they're evil when they're gone.

627
01:12:25,539 --> 01:12:27,473
Has the third act begun yet?

628
01:12:29,577 --> 01:12:31,807
lt's just about to.

629
01:12:34,682 --> 01:12:36,912
lt's just about to.

630
01:13:28,068 --> 01:13:30,468
Violet. It's me, Garth.

631
01:13:30,638 --> 01:13:33,505
Listen, turn on the TV.

632
01:13:33,674 --> 01:13:36,507
You're all over the place.
Every channel.

633
01:13:36,844 --> 01:13:39,210
-Just minutes ago--
-Listen to me.

634
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:41,041
I know you're in a bad place.

635
01:13:41,215 --> 01:13:45,174
But what the boy wrote down
on that piece of paper...

636
01:13:45,352 --> 01:13:47,718
...it has something to do
with the HGV virus.

637
01:13:47,888 --> 01:13:50,516
I know it. I can feel it.

638
01:13:50,691 --> 01:13:53,683
Violet, if you could just give me
a little more time.

639
01:13:54,862 --> 01:13:57,228
V, are you listening?

640
01:13:59,266 --> 01:14:02,326
A number of helicopters
were also spotted at the scene--

641
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:08,235
-Where are you?
-Outer 1 0th Artery. Westbound.

642
01:14:08,409 --> 01:14:11,242
Stay on course. l'll converge in 1 5.

643
01:14:32,633 --> 01:14:34,191
Archministry on approach.

644
01:14:34,368 --> 01:14:36,233
You can't get in there.
lt's impossible.

645
01:14:36,403 --> 01:14:39,031
Why do you think we had you
intercept the case...

646
01:14:39,206 --> 01:14:42,369
-...before it got back to Archministry?
-l'm aware of that.

647
01:14:44,578 --> 01:14:46,375
What's the point? Retribution?

648
01:14:46,981 --> 01:14:49,779
-The boy is dead.
-He's not dead.

649
01:14:50,851 --> 01:14:52,978
-What do you mean?
-Weapons capacity reached.

650
01:14:53,153 --> 01:14:55,553
l mean Six is alive.

651
01:14:55,723 --> 01:14:58,487
Violet, how can he be alive?

652
01:14:58,659 --> 01:15:00,650
Look, what the boy
wrote down on the paper...

653
01:15:00,828 --> 01:15:03,228
...it's the chemical foundation
of what l'm certain...

654
01:15:03,397 --> 01:15:05,058
...is a cure for hemoglophagia.

655
01:15:05,232 --> 01:15:07,132
Daxus' researchers probably
developed it...

656
01:15:07,301 --> 01:15:09,462
...in the same lab
that he was bred in.

657
01:15:09,636 --> 01:15:12,434
Just give me a little time.
l can cure you.

658
01:15:13,407 --> 01:15:14,635
l know it.

659
01:15:52,546 --> 01:15:56,004
The antigen can't survive
without a living host.

660
01:15:56,183 --> 01:16:00,950
However, we may be able to salvage
some viable basic protein analogs...

661
01:16:01,121 --> 01:16:07,424
...that will save us time in re-culturing
the antigen in another clone.

662
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:26,812
Searching for concealed weapons.

663
01:16:31,652 --> 01:16:36,521
Number of weapons found: many.

664
01:16:36,690 --> 01:16:39,318
l'm here to see the vice-cardinal.

665
01:16:43,163 --> 01:16:44,721
Yellow alert! Yellow alert!

666
01:16:44,765 --> 01:16:46,255
Yellow alert! Yellow alert!

667
01:16:46,433 --> 01:16:50,369
Yellow alert! Yellow alert!
Yellow alert!

668
01:16:50,537 --> 01:16:54,200
-lt's-- lt's her.
-She's dead.

669
01:16:59,813 --> 01:17:01,678
Oh, my God.

670
01:17:05,252 --> 01:17:10,519
Single female intruder identified
at Security Portal One.

671
01:17:10,691 --> 01:17:12,784
Please remain calm.

672
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:17,624
Pacification and neutralization
is underway.

673
01:17:23,937 --> 01:17:26,531
The boy's dead.
This is pure suicide.

674
01:18:45,686 --> 01:18:49,053
Yellow alert upgraded.
Orange alert.

675
01:18:49,223 --> 01:18:52,056
One woman against 1 4 men?
lt's ridiculous.

676
01:18:52,226 --> 01:18:54,626
Have the Gas Guard waiting
for her in the library.

677
01:18:54,795 --> 01:18:56,695
-l'm going to level her.
-Orange alert.

678
01:20:29,489 --> 01:20:32,219
How much weaponry
does she have left?

679
01:20:32,392 --> 01:20:36,089
Based on the scans taken
from the security portal...

680
01:20:36,263 --> 01:20:37,787
...plenty.

681
01:20:40,934 --> 01:20:41,923
Okay.

682
01:21:14,534 --> 01:21:17,196
Red alert. Red alert.

683
01:21:17,871 --> 01:21:20,271
Red alert. Red alert.

684
01:22:35,682 --> 01:22:38,981
You are all gonna die.

685
01:23:00,106 --> 01:23:02,131
ls that all you've got?

686
01:23:08,682 --> 01:23:11,879
Violet, the boy is dead.

687
01:23:12,052 --> 01:23:16,386
You obviously don't have
a clear grasp of what dead really is.

688
01:23:16,556 --> 01:23:18,319
Allow me to demonstrate.

689
01:23:19,025 --> 01:23:22,324
For God's sakes.
Violet, l'm unarmed.

690
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:28,790
Not yet, you're not.

691
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:33,638
No.

692
01:23:47,687 --> 01:23:49,382
You got Hemo blood on me.

693
01:23:59,533 --> 01:24:01,023
lt is on.

694
01:24:28,795 --> 01:24:30,126
Yeah, it is.

695
01:24:56,957 --> 01:24:59,824
Yes, no doubt, in a fair fight
you would beat me.

696
01:25:02,062 --> 01:25:04,929
But that's not how l got
where l am today.

697
01:25:18,078 --> 01:25:20,137
Can you see me, Violet?

698
01:25:22,315 --> 01:25:23,543
No?

699
01:25:23,717 --> 01:25:27,380
Too bad you converted with
only mild light sensitivity.

700
01:25:27,554 --> 01:25:29,419
Unlike me.

701
01:25:29,589 --> 01:25:32,387
-What?
-That's right, Violet.

702
01:25:32,559 --> 01:25:34,754
How do you think
a lowly lab technician...

703
01:25:34,928 --> 01:25:37,658
...made that meteoric rise
through the ranks?

704
01:25:37,831 --> 01:25:39,264
What accident of providence...

705
01:25:39,432 --> 01:25:43,163
...do you think gave him
those additional qualities?

706
01:25:43,336 --> 01:25:45,531
Yes, Violet...

707
01:25:45,705 --> 01:25:48,071
...I'm like you.

708
01:25:48,875 --> 01:25:50,365
My God.

709
01:25:50,543 --> 01:25:55,810
With the minor exception that
l'm going to walk out of here alive.

710
01:25:56,850 --> 01:25:58,647
Violet?

711
01:25:59,586 --> 01:26:00,917
Violet.

712
01:26:53,273 --> 01:26:55,833
Do you believe in God, Violet?

713
01:26:56,810 --> 01:26:59,244
Do you hope he's merciful?

714
01:26:59,412 --> 01:27:02,108
Do you think he'll welcome you
into his arms...

715
01:27:02,282 --> 01:27:06,548
...like the so very many you've
sent his way?

716
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:08,449
Hey, Daxus.

717
01:27:10,924 --> 01:27:13,358
You know, after this,
l think he will.

718
01:27:58,972 --> 01:28:00,803
Six.

719
01:28:02,142 --> 01:28:04,167
Six, wake up.

720
01:28:05,178 --> 01:28:06,236
Violet?

721
01:28:08,581 --> 01:28:10,242
But...

722
01:28:10,416 --> 01:28:13,476
...l thought l was dead.

723
01:28:14,754 --> 01:28:15,743
No.

724
01:28:34,707 --> 01:28:36,641
You've just been reborn.

725
01:28:44,717 --> 01:28:45,945
Violet?

726
01:28:48,421 --> 01:28:50,321
Violet.

727
01:28:51,057 --> 01:28:52,922
Violet.

728
01:28:55,628 --> 01:28:58,722
-lt's okay.
-No, it's not.

729
01:28:58,898 --> 01:29:01,867
Violet, listen to me.

730
01:29:03,336 --> 01:29:04,701
There's a cure.

731
01:29:06,306 --> 01:29:07,671
l know.

732
01:29:12,345 --> 01:29:14,210
l've found it.

733
01:29:21,788 --> 01:29:23,653
Come on.

734
01:29:32,398 --> 01:29:37,358
Yes, I was born into a world
you might not understand...

735
01:29:37,537 --> 01:29:40,131
...but a world, as it turns out...

736
01:29:40,306 --> 01:29:43,742
...where hope still lives.

737
01:29:46,312 --> 01:29:48,644
And my body?

738
01:29:48,815 --> 01:29:50,976
Would Garth be able to fix it...

739
01:29:51,150 --> 01:29:54,142
...the way another
had cured my soul?

740
01:29:54,888 --> 01:29:58,415
Maybe, maybe not.

741
01:29:58,591 --> 01:30:00,582
But this I do know:

742
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:04,355
All those still out there
who spread oppression...

743
01:30:04,530 --> 01:30:08,261
...injustice and hatred...

744
01:30:08,434 --> 01:30:10,197
...they better hope not.
