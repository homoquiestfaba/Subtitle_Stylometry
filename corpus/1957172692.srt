00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:47,161
Well follow me.

183
00:15:47,204 --> 00:15:50,425
I'm the Assistant Manager of Development at Game Ink.

184
00:15:50,468 --> 00:15:53,994
Here we've created such games asMutant Mutilator, The Monster 11 Series...

185
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,561
Mutant Mutilator was awesome!

186
00:15:56,605 --> 00:15:58,172
[laughs] Thank you.

187
00:15:58,215 --> 00:15:59,956
I can't believe this counts for community service.

188
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,089
This is the game room.

189
00:16:02,132 --> 00:16:03,917
Wow.

190
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,266
This is where we test all of the new products we've developed.

191
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:07,616
Currently we are testing six newgames.

192
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:09,400
This isn't supposed to be out yet.

193
00:16:09,444 --> 00:16:11,098
That's right. It's a beta version.

194
00:16:11,141 --> 00:16:14,188
It actually won't be sold until after Christmas.

195
00:16:14,231 --> 00:16:16,190
And this is Mr. Daniels.

196
00:16:16,233 --> 00:16:18,366
The Director of Research and Development.

197
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:19,280
Mr. Daniels...

198
00:16:19,323 --> 00:16:21,804
this is Scott, Jessica and Max.

199
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,502
Thanks for taking the time tocome and meet with us.

200
00:16:24,546 --> 00:16:27,114
Now... when can you start?

201
00:16:27,157 --> 00:16:29,333
Are you serious? Today!

202
00:16:29,377 --> 00:16:30,856
Yeah.

203
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,554
Good.

204
00:16:32,597 --> 00:16:35,992
We'll need your parents to sign these forms.

205
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,038
Here ya are.

206
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:44,087
And here are your access cards so you can get into the game room on your own.

207
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:44,827
Awesome.

208
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,915
Cool.

209
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:47,395
Yeah.

210
00:16:47,438 --> 00:16:48,483
Oh, I forgot something in the game room.

211
00:16:48,526 --> 00:16:50,615
No problem. Just use your access card.

212
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:57,231
Thanks.

213
00:16:57,274 --> 00:16:59,233
Yeah.

214
00:16:59,276 --> 00:17:03,585
Your mission is a go. The discyou received outlines the entire plan.

215
00:17:03,628 --> 00:17:06,327
For me to take this kind of risk I'm gonna need more money.

216
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,198
A deal's a deal.

217
00:17:08,242 --> 00:17:12,507
Memorize the plan. Then I want that disc back so it can be destroyed.

218
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:18,034
Okay. I'll stick with the plan.

219
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,644
Oh, sorry about that.

220
00:17:19,688 --> 00:17:21,255
What are you doin' here?

221
00:17:21,298 --> 00:17:23,822
I forgot my pen.

222
00:17:23,866 --> 00:17:24,910
I see.

223
00:17:24,954 --> 00:17:26,216
No.

224
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:30,481
I'll clean it up.

225
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,194
We should get back to school.

226
00:17:47,237 --> 00:17:49,979
Hey. It's still early.

227
00:17:50,023 --> 00:17:51,067
Radio check.

228
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,112
I'm on.

229
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:53,330
Me, too.

230
00:17:53,374 --> 00:17:55,289
Guys, I have something to tell you.

231
00:17:55,332 --> 00:17:56,986
What is it, Max?

232
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,380
I overheard Mr. Daniels talking on the phone.

233
00:17:59,423 --> 00:18:01,338
You were eavesdropping?

234
00:18:01,382 --> 00:18:03,079
What did he say?

235
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:07,257
He's got some sort of weird plangoing on. I don't trust the guy.

236
00:18:07,301 --> 00:18:08,693
What do you mean?

237
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:11,870
He has a plan on a disc.

238
00:18:11,914 --> 00:18:17,311
I bumped into him and it fell out of his briefcase so I borrowed it.

239
00:18:17,354 --> 00:18:21,532
Borrowed it! You mean you took a disc from Game Ink?

240
00:18:21,576 --> 00:18:24,405
No, I borrowed it from Mr. Daniels.

241
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:27,495
I can't believe this. We're gonna get fired.

242
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:29,149
I'll check the disc out tonight.

243
00:18:31,107 --> 00:18:34,545
Let I don't wanna know.

244
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:40,160
Let's get back to class.

245
00:18:46,862 --> 00:18:49,430
This is a serious subject.

246
00:18:49,473 --> 00:18:51,693
I will not be made a fool of.

247
00:18:51,736 --> 00:18:56,350
We're late!

248
00:18:56,393 --> 00:19:01,006
Now class these are the human reproductive organs.

249
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,139
Otherwise known as the--

250
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,227
Yo, Max.

251
00:19:04,271 --> 00:19:05,489
You're just in time.

252
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:06,273
[laughs]

253
00:19:06,316 --> 00:19:07,404
[start laughing]

254
00:19:07,448 --> 00:19:09,145
No!

255
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,321
[laughs]

256
00:19:11,365 --> 00:19:13,584
This needs to be taken
 seriously.

257
00:19:13,628 --> 00:19:14,150
I--

258
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,586
You--

259
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,633
Stop! This needs to be taken seriously!

260
00:19:18,676 --> 00:19:22,724
Glad you could make it, man.

261
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:25,640
Well. Now where were we?

262
00:19:25,683 --> 00:19:32,168
[bell rings]

263
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,778
Hi Jessica.

264
00:19:33,822 --> 00:19:35,258
Hi.

265
00:19:35,302 --> 00:19:36,999
Does she like Max or something?

266
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:40,307
No, she just hangs out with boys.

267
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:44,224
It's okay. They don't have half as much fun as we do, Jess.

268
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:47,052
Yeah, no kidding.

269
00:19:47,096 --> 00:19:50,578
Hello, Jessica.

270
00:19:50,621 --> 00:19:52,406
Hi, Bean.

271
00:19:52,449 --> 00:19:56,540
I still haven't heard back onour possible interstellar date.

272
00:19:56,584 --> 00:20:01,589
My chauffeur...I mean sister, just got her license and she owes me.

273
00:20:01,632 --> 00:20:07,290
Yeah. I've been meaning to get back to you on that one. I'm thinking no.

274
00:20:07,334 --> 00:20:08,813
[small gasp]

275
00:20:08,857 --> 00:20:11,120
You're not my type, Bean.

276
00:20:11,164 --> 00:20:14,645
No?

277
00:20:14,689 --> 00:20:16,212
Attention, attention.

278
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,432
Only a week until the schooldance.

279
00:20:18,475 --> 00:20:20,782
Be sure and get all your library books in

280
00:20:20,825 --> 00:20:24,002
if you want to attend this exciting end-of-the-year activity.

281
00:20:24,046 --> 00:20:26,918
Hi, Max.

282
00:20:26,962 --> 00:20:29,007
Only a week.

283
00:20:29,051 --> 00:20:33,664
Oh and Max, do your homeworktonight if you want to stay out of summer school.

284
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:46,677
[camera snaps]

285
00:20:46,721 --> 00:20:49,941
These are the security logs for everyone in and out of the building last night.

286
00:20:49,985 --> 00:20:52,205
The vault itself has a
 fingerprint scan

287
00:20:52,248 --> 00:20:55,338
which only opens to people with top level security clearance.

288
00:20:55,382 --> 00:20:57,645
But h- how is this relevant?

289
00:20:57,688 --> 00:21:01,344
Sir, according to our logs, yourfingerprints were used to break into the vault last night.

290
00:21:01,388 --> 00:21:05,566
My fingerprints? How could that be possible?

291
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:08,177
They could've been taken from adoor handle or even a pop can.

292
00:21:08,221 --> 00:21:10,658
So what's missing from thevault?

293
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:12,877
We're still trying to determine that.

294
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:14,749
Looks like only one microchip is missing.

295
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:15,837
What is it?

296
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,621
It's called the IMX-7 chip.

297
00:21:17,665 --> 00:21:20,015
We're doing our best todetermine what it is right now.

298
00:21:20,058 --> 00:21:22,322
But there are over five hundred microchips in that vault.

299
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:24,193
So it'll take time.

300
00:21:24,237 --> 00:21:27,892
The lead developer is ascientist named Kenneth Nimble.

301
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,895
Get him over here.

302
00:21:30,939 --> 00:21:32,941
At 8 a.m. Eastern time yesterday morning,

303
00:21:32,984 --> 00:21:35,117
it was discovered that a top secret microchip was stolen

304
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,772
from a heavily guarded vaultinside the FBI.

305
00:21:37,815 --> 00:21:40,296
All major governmental agencies have been notified and...

306
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,431
joint investigations involving the FBI, the CIA and the NSA have begun.

307
00:21:44,474 --> 00:21:47,303
I cannot disclose what information was on the chip,

308
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:52,439
however, all of the government'sresources are at the disposal of the investigative teams.

309
00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:55,442
That is all I can say at this
 time. Thank you.

[overlapping shouting out questions]

311
00:21:59,968 --> 00:22:02,840
Sir, the FBI Director is on his way to meet with you.

312
00:22:02,884 --> 00:22:05,756
Most likely he'll ask youquestions regarding the
 microchip.

313
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,629
Tell him what you know andthis'll be over before you know it.

314
00:22:08,672 --> 00:22:14,896
Here he is.

00:22:14,939 --> 00:22:16,332
Hello. Jim Kelly.

00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,334
Kenneth Nimble.

317
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,337
Doctor Nimble, what can you tellme about what's on this stolen chip?

318
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:25,341
This chip holds sophisticated fingerprint technology...

319
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:28,301
including fingerprints of top military leaders...

320
00:22:28,344 --> 00:22:31,478
U.S. Senators, Congressmen...

321
00:22:31,521 --> 00:22:35,482
and the President of the UnitedStates.

322
00:22:35,525 --> 00:22:39,834
Does this chip have some kind of a tracking device in it so we can at least find it?

323
00:22:39,877 --> 00:22:42,967
No one thought it could ever bestolen.

324
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:48,277
And no one believed the Titanic could sink.

325
00:22:48,321 --> 00:22:51,236
The Secretary of Defense wouldlike an update.

326
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,935
Thank you, I'm almost done here.

327
00:22:53,978 --> 00:22:57,025
Doctor Nimble, why would somebody want to steal this chip?

328
00:22:57,068 --> 00:23:02,160
Someone could infiltrate topsecret facilities, underground bunkers.

329
00:23:02,204 --> 00:23:08,471
The possibilities of someone with access to these fingerprints are endless.

330
00:23:08,515 --> 00:23:10,604
Thank you for your time, Doctor
Nimble.

331
00:23:10,647 --> 00:23:13,084
Mr. Kelly.

332
00:23:13,128 --> 00:23:20,831

Three years ago I took a chance on these highly skilled kids.

I inducted them into the agency.

Since then they've completed forty-three assignments over four continents.

Sir, are these the agents who recovered the Prime Minister last Fall?
