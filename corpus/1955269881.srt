1
00:00:27,425 --> 00:00:31,296
911, what's your emergency?

2
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:34,766
911, please state
your emergency.

3
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,269
My
brother can't open his eyes.

4
00:00:37,302 --> 00:00:40,439
Ok, what happened to him?

5
00:00:40,472 --> 00:00:42,574
I don't think he's breathing.

6
00:00:42,607 --> 00:00:46,411
What's his name?

7
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:49,548
Ben. He... he hit his head.

8
00:00:50,783 --> 00:00:53,286
And your name?

9
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,420
Angela.

10
00:00:55,454 --> 00:00:59,524
Ok,
where are your parents, Angela?

11
00:01:01,192 --> 00:01:02,561
Angela?

12
00:01:02,594 --> 00:01:04,697
There is so much blood.

13
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,867
No! You...

14
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,669
Angela, if you
know your address,

15
00:01:09,701 --> 00:01:11,736
I need you to tell me that.

16
00:01:14,472 --> 00:01:15,841
I need you to...

17
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,545
Hello?

18
00:01:20,806 --> 00:01:26,317
<b>BEAUTIFUL PRISON</b>

19
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:30,285
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

20
00:01:59,685 --> 00:02:02,621
You, too, Ben.

21
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:05,191
Ben.

22
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:07,159
Come on.
Let's go, lunch.

23
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,134
Come on.
Let's go.

24
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,776
Angie.

25
00:02:23,808 --> 00:02:27,246
Hey, I brought
you your favorite.

26
00:02:27,278 --> 00:02:29,382
-Lasagna.
-Here you go.

27
00:02:29,414 --> 00:02:30,917
-Hey, baby.
-Hey.

28
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:32,117
You brought lasagna?

29
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:36,889
No, not for you, I got
you some salad... here you go...

30
00:02:36,921 --> 00:02:38,623
and some fat-free
ranch dressing,

31
00:02:38,657 --> 00:02:40,627
for your blood pressure.

32
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:46,299
I hate my life.

33
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:54,706
Ben, bro, can I
have some of that?

34
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:59,812
Just a little bit, I'm
just... I'm not...

35
00:02:59,844 --> 00:03:02,314
did Angie make this for you?

36
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,684
I love that woman.

37
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,552
So don't forget to pay
Ben's rent this month.

38
00:03:06,585 --> 00:03:08,254
-His rent?
-Yes.

39
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:09,688
We just paid rent.

40
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:10,689
Baby, it's the 30th.

41
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:13,259
That was last month.

42
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:15,828
Maybe take about 1,000 pesos
for his first groceries, too.

43
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,895
I'm always paying.

44
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:20,265
Baby, he's family.

45
00:03:20,932 --> 00:03:23,235
Not my family.

46
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,376
-Hey, Jerry.
-So much, she's so...

47
00:03:30,408 --> 00:03:33,445
-Hi.
-What's up?

48
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,349
Hi, so, listen.
Today's Tuesday.

49
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,550
Tuesday, when was that?

50
00:03:37,582 --> 00:03:40,286
So don't forget
about, you know.

51
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,021
Groceries, Tuesday, I know.

52
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:44,490
How are you?

53
00:03:44,522 --> 00:03:46,558
I'm wonderful.
Thank you.

54
00:03:46,592 --> 00:03:47,727
I want to talk to
you about something.

55
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,996
Number one, you look fabulous.

56
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,031
Well, thanks, Jerry.

57
00:03:52,064 --> 00:03:54,734
Can I compliment
a married woman?

58
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:57,469
I think I just did,
and this lasagna...

59
00:03:57,502 --> 00:03:59,337
Is so scrumptious.

60
00:03:59,371 --> 00:04:00,772
Thank you.

61
00:04:00,806 --> 00:04:02,908
You put a lot of love into everything,
and I appreciate that about you.

62
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:04,576
-Thank you.
-You deserve love.

63
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,579
I get love.

64
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:11,717
Chente, Chente, did you
get any of this lasagna?

65
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,989
Did he get any of this lasagna?

66
00:04:20,658 --> 00:04:22,861
No, he didn't.

67
00:04:52,057 --> 00:04:53,725
Shit.

68
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:57,096
, Ben.

69
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:59,498
This is the second
time this week.

70
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:01,466
-What were you doing?
-Chente, bro, chill out.

71
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,536
Stay out of this, Jerry.

72
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,538
Who do you think
got him this job?

73
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:08,708
This reflects on me.

74
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,810
Really? Really?

75
00:05:20,985 --> 00:05:22,855
I'll see you in 10 minutes.

76
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:30,729
B, B, forget about
that shit, ok?

77
00:05:30,762 --> 00:05:32,597
You do your thing.
Pick this up.

78
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,732
Do your thing.
Forget it.

79
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,867
You're all right.
You're all right.

80
00:06:13,872 --> 00:06:15,408
Sorry, señor.

81
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:37,950
Don't do it, Jubilee.

82
00:08:37,982 --> 00:08:39,284
Don't do it.

83
00:08:48,793 --> 00:08:52,331
Ben, don't do it, Jubilee?

84
00:08:52,364 --> 00:08:54,300
I can hear that shit
out in the street.

85
00:09:00,972 --> 00:09:02,140
Are you ready?

86
00:09:04,842 --> 00:09:07,979
Ben, groceries, it's Tuesday.

87
00:09:08,013 --> 00:09:09,014
Yeah.

88
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:11,783
Listen.
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

89
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,318
I'm gonna wash my
hands real quick,

90
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:15,288
and then we're gonna go, ok?

91
00:09:17,355 --> 00:09:23,195
Ben, Ben, I hear she's
a bitch in real life.

92
00:09:23,227 --> 00:09:26,097
I'm just saying.
I'm just saying.

93
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,933
Loosen up, bro.

94
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:38,244
He didn't mean that.

95
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:51,691
You all right?

96
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,230
Jerry's going number two.

97
00:09:59,264 --> 00:10:01,634
Where's your toilet paper?

98
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,134
Never mind, I found it.

99
00:10:05,403 --> 00:10:07,273
I'm almost done, Ben.

100
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:11,844
Come on, Ben.

101
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:13,878
Let's go down the cereal aisle.

102
00:10:17,081 --> 00:10:18,783
You want Choco Bolito?

103
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:21,687
Ben, don't look at that shit.

104
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,389
What did I tell you about that?

105
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:25,124
Ok, now, stay right here.

106
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,393
You want Choco Bolitos?

107
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:33,399
Ok, all right, I'm gonna go
with Dino Flakes... Dino Flakes.

108
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,300
You like that, don't you?

109
00:10:35,332 --> 00:10:38,269
You like that shit, when I
do that kind of shit?

110
00:10:38,302 --> 00:10:39,737
Yeah.

111
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,005
See, this is the kind
of Ben that I need.

112
00:10:41,038 --> 00:10:43,341
I want... can I talk
to you for a second?

113
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,778
When you're at work,
you gotta keep your mind

114
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,447
focused, ok, buddy, ok?

115
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,349
I don't want to get
all serious, but you

116
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:53,251
gotta keep your mind
focused, ok, like Jerry.

117
00:10:53,284 --> 00:10:55,754
When Jerry punches into
work, on the clock,

118
00:10:55,787 --> 00:10:58,456
he's like,
you know?

119
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,725
I'm like, hoo.

120
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:01,160
I'm there.

121
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:03,028
I'm there to do a
job, and I do it.

122
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:04,897
And I focus on the task at hand.

123
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:06,731
ok, Ben?

124
00:11:06,764 --> 00:11:09,735
You gotta focus on the
task at hand, all right?

125
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:11,235
-Ok.
-Yeah.

126
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:13,038
-Ok. Ok.
-You got it.

127
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:14,306
You got this, shit.

128
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:15,774
Ok.

129
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:17,442
Listen, another thing.

130
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:20,446
Your brother-in-law, Chente,
he's a mean-ass dick,

131
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:23,883
and it sucks that your
hot sister married him.

132
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,820
He's always mad at me.

133
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:32,791
Bro, when I get a chance,
I'm gonna slap his ass.

134
00:11:32,823 --> 00:11:35,293
I hate that he's
always mad at you, man.

135
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:37,196
You're a good man, Ben.

136
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,274
Ben,...

137
00:11:51,976 --> 00:11:56,215
there's your girl,
all over the world.

138
00:12:07,024 --> 00:12:08,259
What are they saying?

139
00:12:08,293 --> 00:12:09,360
What?

140
00:12:09,394 --> 00:12:11,330
What are they saying, Jerry?

141
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:17,269
What are they saying?

142
00:12:17,302 --> 00:12:19,739
Let me check.
Ok.

143
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:25,377
-What are they saying?
-Shit.

144
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:26,978
What is it?

145
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:30,481
What is it, Jerry?

146
00:12:30,514 --> 00:12:32,751
What?

147
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,887
Jubilee died.

148
00:12:36,421 --> 00:12:38,557
I'm sorry.

149
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,559
-Hey, hey, hey.
-No.

150
00:12:40,591 --> 00:12:42,326
Hey, no, I'm kidding, man.
I'm kidding.

151
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,228
She ain't dead.

152
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,362
I'm sorry, Ben.

153
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:45,463
No.

154
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:50,802
ok, he's fine.
He's fine.

155
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,205
Ben, Ben, I'm kidding, man.

156
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:54,873
That was a joke.

157
00:12:54,905 --> 00:12:56,307
Jerry's a dick.

158
00:12:56,341 --> 00:12:58,442
Jerry's a dick.

159
00:12:58,475 --> 00:12:59,610
She ain't dead, Bro.

160
00:12:59,644 --> 00:13:01,846
She's coming to Saltillo.
She's coming to Saltillo?

161
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:04,149
-Yeah, yeah.
-She's coming to Saltillo?

162
00:13:04,182 --> 00:13:05,149
Come on.

163
00:13:05,182 --> 00:13:06,418
Yeah, man.

164
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:07,920
-She's coming to Saltillo?
-Yeah.

165
00:13:07,952 --> 00:13:09,221
She's coming to Saltillo?

166
00:13:09,254 --> 00:13:11,889
Yeah, she's coming to Saltillo,
yeah. Yeah. What do you think?

167
00:13:11,923 --> 00:13:12,756
Yeah, you want to meet her?
Yeah.

168
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,295
-You want to meet her?
-Yeah, yeah.

169
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:17,528
, man.

170
00:13:17,562 --> 00:13:19,398
-She's coming to Saltillo?
-Yeah.

171
00:14:06,443 --> 00:14:12,851
I know you're an angel...
but I'm not sure you can fly.

172
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,524
Ben.

173
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:26,465
They told me you were dead.

174
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,533
What did I tell you?

175
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:31,036
Our love will keep you alive.

176
00:14:31,068 --> 00:14:32,604
And it has.

177
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,055
Ben, Ben, come on.

178
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:50,988
What the hell?
What the hell?

179
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,925
Shit, I'm sorry. Go.
Get out of here.

180
00:14:52,957 --> 00:14:54,525
Go. Go.
Jerry will take care of this.

181
00:14:54,558 --> 00:14:57,096
It's ok.
Jerry will take care of it.

182
00:14:58,596 --> 00:15:00,532
Where is Ben?
Where is Ben?

183
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:02,000
He's taking a leak.

184
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:02,667
Yeah?

185
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:04,536
I don't know this machinery.

186
00:15:04,568 --> 00:15:07,139
It got away from me.

187
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:08,407
Bueno?

188
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,275
Yeah.

189
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:14,278
Yeah, you understand you
have to take a drug test now.

190
00:15:14,312 --> 00:15:15,947
You know where to go.

191
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:25,157
Chente, you want my piss?

192
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,492
All right.

193
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,112
I don't want to go.
Come on.

194
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:48,679
Chente.

195
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:50,548
Chente.

196
00:15:52,783 --> 00:15:54,552
I gave you five years, Chente.

197
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:58,056
Jerry, Jerry.

198
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:01,460
Whatever, I don't need you.

199
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,562
I don't need this place.

200
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:06,064
You guys are gonna crumble in
six months, anyway, without me.

201
00:16:06,096 --> 00:16:08,066
That's right.

202
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:09,334
Look out the windows at me.

203
00:16:09,366 --> 00:16:11,336
I ain't crazy.

204
00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:13,105
You're crazy.

205
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,074
I'm gonna smoke a blunt.

206
00:16:18,442 --> 00:16:20,278
Where's Jerry going?

207
00:16:20,311 --> 00:16:22,114
Get back to work, Ben.

208
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,281
Wha... where's
Jerry going, Chente?

209
00:16:23,313 --> 00:16:24,348
-Shut up, Ben.
-Where's Jerry going?

210
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:28,085
-Shut up.
-Where's Jerry going?

211
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:30,489
If you don't shut the hell
up, you're getting fired, too.

212
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,357
I'm saving your ass here.

213
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:44,369
Hey, what's up?

214
00:16:44,402 --> 00:16:45,370
You've reached Jerry.
Jerry, it's Ben.

215
00:16:45,403 --> 00:16:46,904
Where...

216
00:16:46,937 --> 00:16:49,441
I'm not here right now, so
leave a message at the tone.

217
00:16:55,613 --> 00:16:58,150
Jerry, it's Ben.

218
00:16:58,182 --> 00:17:04,256
I don't know where you are or
if you can call me or come...

219
00:17:04,288 --> 00:17:06,825
come to my house.

220
00:17:06,857 --> 00:17:09,327
I'm sorry if I made
trouble for you.

221
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,274
He's costing us money.

222
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,276
He's, like, working there, but
his mind is in another place,

223
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:25,509
you know?

224
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:26,477
You just have
to be patient with him.

225
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,378
Just be patient.

226
00:17:27,412 --> 00:17:28,680
No, I've been patient.

227
00:17:28,712 --> 00:17:30,781
I got him that job,
you know, for you.

228
00:17:30,815 --> 00:17:32,250
Yeah, you said he
needed something to do.

229
00:17:32,282 --> 00:17:33,484
Don't do that.

230
00:17:33,518 --> 00:17:35,086
Do not turn this around on me.

231
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:35,753
No, no, I know.

232
00:17:35,787 --> 00:17:37,355
I'm sorry.

233
00:17:37,387 --> 00:17:39,423
I'm sorry.

234
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:42,694
You know, this isn't... it's just
that I'm going to get fired,

235
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:45,564
and then neither of us
are going to have a job.

236
00:17:45,596 --> 00:17:48,666
We can't take care of
him our whole lives.

237
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,302
We need to put him in a place
where he can be managed.

238
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,836
Managed?

239
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:53,437
Yeah, where he can be looked
after and be with other people

240
00:17:53,471 --> 00:17:54,372
like him.

241
00:17:54,404 --> 00:17:57,108
He's not like other people.

242
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:01,446
He... he wasn't always like
this, and you know that, Chente.

243
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:03,715
If you had grown
up with our father,

244
00:18:03,748 --> 00:18:06,852
if you'd seen the kind of abuse
that Ben went through... I'm

245
00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:08,586
sorry.

246
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:10,888
I just... I... I'd rather he
move into the house with us

247
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:13,357
than put him into some
God-forsaken institution.

248
00:18:13,391 --> 00:18:15,293
No, no, that's not an option.

249
00:18:15,326 --> 00:18:17,162
It's worth discussing.

250
00:18:17,194 --> 00:18:20,264
No, he can't move in here
and disrupt our lives.

251
00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:24,368
My God.

252
00:18:30,307 --> 00:18:31,643
Baby, I'm sorry.

253
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:35,480
Come on.
I'm sorry.

254
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:37,348
We never fought before
I got him this job,

255
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:40,152
and now all we do
is fight about Ben.

256
00:18:40,184 --> 00:18:43,387
Maybe he is ruining us.

257
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:47,325
I didn't say, I do,
to both you and him.

258
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:48,726
He's got...

259
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:49,862
Ben.

260
00:18:53,698 --> 00:18:55,534
Dinner is ready.

261
00:19:07,945 --> 00:19:13,451
Ben, pass me the salt.
Ben, pass me the salt.

262
00:19:15,452 --> 00:19:18,822
All right, I cannot take this shit
from either of you anymore, you guys.

263
00:19:18,855 --> 00:19:24,895
I... all right, Ben,
Chente is my husband,

264
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:27,532
and I love him very
much, all right?

265
00:19:27,565 --> 00:19:30,936
And you're going to
have to accept that.

266
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:34,773
And, Chente, Ben is
a part of our family,

267
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:37,709
and you're just going to
have to grow up about it.

268
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,648
He's always being mean.

269
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:46,218
I'm your boss, Ben.

270
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,687
I have to be tough when
people don't do their jobs.

271
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:52,423
Does that make sense, Ben?

272
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:55,427
He fired Jerry.

273
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,828
-You fired Jerry?
-I had to.

274
00:19:57,862 --> 00:20:00,832
I had to, to save your
brother's ass, so instead

275
00:20:00,865 --> 00:20:02,767
of keeping an employee
around who can manage a line,

276
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,436
I kept Ben here, Ben the retard.

277
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,770
Chente, what the hell?

278
00:20:06,804 --> 00:20:07,772
My...

279
00:20:10,775 --> 00:20:12,777
No, no, no, no.

280
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,746
No, no, no.

281
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:17,781
Get the fuck out
of my house, man.

282
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:20,719
This is my family.

283
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:29,760
Stop it.

284
00:20:29,794 --> 00:20:30,895
Stay down, Ben.

285
00:20:30,928 --> 00:20:32,731
He can't defend himself!

286
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:34,331
All you do is
hold us back, Ben.

287
00:20:34,365 --> 00:20:35,799
Stop! Please just stop!

288
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:38,736
My God.

289
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:40,538
My God.

290
00:20:47,077 --> 00:20:49,513
When I tell you to do
something, you do it!

291
00:21:10,034 --> 00:21:12,604
No, no, no, no, Ben!

292
00:21:12,636 --> 00:21:13,672
Ben!

293
00:21:24,115 --> 00:21:29,554
Look at you, you little shit.

294
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:40,332
Ben?

295
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,500
Ben.

296
00:21:47,637 --> 00:21:49,406
Ben.

297
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,309
Thank God.

298
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,644
That's ok.
I got it.

299
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:49,000
Hey, I have your medicine.

300
00:22:49,032 --> 00:22:50,368
Thanks.

301
00:22:52,068 --> 00:22:57,142
Ben, I don't know
what to say, man.

302
00:22:57,174 --> 00:22:59,144
All this...

303
00:23:03,647 --> 00:23:06,117
You can't know
how terrible I feel.

304
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:13,758
I take equal blame.

305
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,126
I'm just...

306
00:24:52,088 --> 00:24:54,259
I've come for the one I love.

307
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:57,095
I made the mistake of
letting you go once.

308
00:24:57,127 --> 00:24:59,029
I'm done making mistakes.

309
00:25:08,638 --> 00:25:10,875
You can't forget me, Ben.

310
00:25:10,907 --> 00:25:13,244
You can't forget me!

311
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:56,788
That's not funny at all.
That's...

312
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:05,663
Spanish...
I can understand you, and you...

313
00:26:13,971 --> 00:26:17,642
and you, and you.

314
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:31,589
Hello?

315
00:26:39,396 --> 00:26:40,932
Hello?

316
00:26:44,268 --> 00:26:45,737
Who's there?

317
00:26:53,877 --> 00:26:55,079
Hello?

318
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:58,316
Who's there?

319
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:53,203
Hello?

320
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:55,373
Hello?

321
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:28,239
Jerry?

322
00:28:51,394 --> 00:28:52,997
Hey, Ben.

323
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:54,365
Angela.

324
00:28:54,397 --> 00:28:56,199
Sorry it took me
so long to visit.

325
00:28:56,232 --> 00:28:59,403
I just, I just needed
some time to clear up my head.

326
00:28:59,435 --> 00:29:01,105
I brought you some flowers.

327
00:29:01,137 --> 00:29:03,907
Make this place a little homier.

328
00:29:03,941 --> 00:29:05,210
Thank you.

329
00:29:12,982 --> 00:29:18,556
Ben, I, I wish
Mom was still around.

330
00:29:18,588 --> 00:29:22,225
Me, too, of course.

331
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:26,297
You were, you were way to
young to remember any of this,

332
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:30,433
but, when we
were little, we were

333
00:29:30,467 --> 00:29:33,271
swimming in Uncle Frank's pool.

334
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:38,042
You were just learning to walk,
and Uncle Frank was cooking.

335
00:29:38,075 --> 00:29:41,312
And he burned his
hand on the grill,

336
00:29:41,345 --> 00:29:45,950
and Mom went into the house to
get him some ice or something.

337
00:29:45,982 --> 00:29:49,252
She was gone for
maybe 10 seconds,

338
00:29:49,286 --> 00:29:54,859
but that was all the time
it took you to fall in.

339
00:29:54,892 --> 00:29:59,363
I was the only one in the pool,
so I... I tried to save you,

340
00:29:59,395 --> 00:30:02,299
Ben.

341
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:05,469
I just wasn't strong enough.

342
00:30:05,501 --> 00:30:10,340
I felt so alone and
just helpless, you know?

343
00:30:13,576 --> 00:30:20,350
I mean, Mom... Mom pulled us out,
but right now, Ben, right now,

344
00:30:20,384 --> 00:30:26,257
I... I feel so
helpless and alone.

345
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:28,459
And Mom's not here
to pull us out.

346
00:30:28,491 --> 00:30:32,896
Angela, we're fine.

347
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:37,368
You... you honestly don't
have to worry about me.

348
00:30:37,401 --> 00:30:40,939
Ben, you
don't look so good.

349
00:30:50,247 --> 00:30:51,382
I'm going to go
talk to the doctors.

350
00:30:51,414 --> 00:30:52,582
You don't have to do that.

351
00:30:52,615 --> 00:30:54,218
You know what they're gonna say.

352
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,987
I'll be back.

353
00:31:28,184 --> 00:31:29,252
Hey.

354
00:31:32,221 --> 00:31:33,258
Come on.

355
00:31:46,336 --> 00:31:48,306
What the hell?

356
00:33:26,636 --> 00:33:29,272
Well, thank you for coming, but you
didn't have to come all this way.

357
00:33:37,413 --> 00:33:38,449
Jerry?

358
00:34:13,817 --> 00:34:16,519
I think I already have.

359
00:34:16,552 --> 00:34:18,455
I mean, I've gotten better
at a lot of different things.

360
00:34:44,347 --> 00:34:45,782
Thank you for the cookies.

361
00:35:08,472 --> 00:35:11,542
Señora, Señora!

362
00:35:12,876 --> 00:35:15,179
Fuck, do you
want some of this?

363
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:53,550
No, no, no.

364
00:35:57,554 --> 00:35:59,389
No, no, no, no, no.

365
00:36:55,945 --> 00:36:57,748
It's you little bastards
doing this to me.

366
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,349
I know it.

367
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:52,036
Hey, Ben.

368
00:37:52,068 --> 00:37:54,837
Chente, where
did you come from?

369
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:56,773
I heard that the medicine
wasn't working good,

370
00:37:56,806 --> 00:38:00,510
so I brought you some new
stuff, expensive stuff.

371
00:38:09,686 --> 00:38:10,888
Thanks.

372
00:39:08,478 --> 00:39:09,746
Jerry.

373
00:39:11,581 --> 00:39:13,584
Jerry?

374
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:15,486
You all right, man?

375
00:39:18,487 --> 00:39:19,922
Dude, you all right?

376
00:39:19,956 --> 00:39:22,593
Jerry?

377
00:40:58,688 --> 00:41:00,791
Happy birthday, Ben.

378
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:59,682
Ben.

379
00:41:59,715 --> 00:42:01,684
Angela?

380
00:42:01,717 --> 00:42:02,986
Angela.

381
00:42:05,355 --> 00:42:07,157
I know I said I
was feeling fine,

382
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:10,027
but there is some serious
shit going on here.

383
00:42:12,228 --> 00:42:14,630
Angela, are you ok?

384
00:42:14,664 --> 00:42:18,969
Ben, I, I... I
don't know what to do.

385
00:42:19,001 --> 00:42:21,103
The... the bills, they're...
they're stacking up.

386
00:42:21,137 --> 00:42:24,942
Chente, he feels horrible
about what happened.

387
00:42:24,974 --> 00:42:26,976
I... he stopped working, Ben.

388
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:29,646
He's not going to work anymore.

389
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:30,914
I... I... I don't
know what to do.

390
00:42:30,947 --> 00:42:33,584
I just... I... I don't
know what to do.

391
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:38,021
I... I... I don't think I
can do this anymore, Ben.

392
00:42:38,054 --> 00:42:41,124
Just tell me what you want
me to do, and I'll do it.

393
00:42:41,157 --> 00:42:43,727
I just want you
to wake up, Ben.

394
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,195
Just wake up.

395
00:42:45,228 --> 00:42:46,663
Ben!

396
00:42:46,695 --> 00:42:48,364
Wake up!

397
00:42:48,398 --> 00:42:49,666
Ben, just wake up.

398
00:42:49,699 --> 00:42:51,168
Wake up.

399
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:52,336
Wake up.

400
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:53,804
Ben!

401
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:57,575
Wake up.

402
00:43:13,389 --> 00:43:15,826
I have your medicine.

403
00:43:15,858 --> 00:43:18,961
Ben, I don't know what to say.

404
00:43:18,994 --> 00:43:22,098
You can't know how
terrible I feel.

405
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:25,635
Hey, Ben, sorry it took
me so long to stop by.

406
00:43:25,668 --> 00:43:28,070
I, brought
you these flowers.

407
00:43:28,103 --> 00:43:30,139
Make this place a
little homier.

408
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:37,280
No.

409
00:43:37,746 --> 00:43:39,315
No.

410
00:44:02,137 --> 00:44:03,406
Happy birthday, Ben.

411
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:20,257
Well done, Bennie.

412
00:44:20,289 --> 00:44:22,326
I thought I was going to
lose you there for a minute.

413
00:44:28,764 --> 00:44:30,467
Who the hell are you?

414
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,769
Such hostility, Bennie.

415
00:44:33,802 --> 00:44:35,404
Your father would
be so proud of you.

416
00:44:38,141 --> 00:44:39,876
What did you say?

417
00:44:43,413 --> 00:44:46,949
Black, it's so hard
to keep clean, Bennie.

418
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:54,057
How do I get out of here?

419
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:56,293
Simple, you leave.

420
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:58,161
How?

421
00:44:58,193 --> 00:45:00,797
You're asking me how to
leave a place that you built?

422
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:07,003
What do you mean, a
place that I built?

423
00:45:07,036 --> 00:45:08,405
Look, Bennie, I... I
think we're getting ahead

424
00:45:08,438 --> 00:45:10,140
of ourselves a little bit here.

425
00:45:10,172 --> 00:45:11,908
Let's take it back
a couple days.

426
00:45:26,188 --> 00:45:28,157
ok, when did things
start getting...

427
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:31,927
how should I put this... weird?

428
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,497
What is all of this?

429
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:38,067
Well, everything you
perceive as your reality

430
00:45:38,101 --> 00:45:41,838
really is your reality.

431
00:45:41,871 --> 00:45:48,378
ok, all of this, it's kind of like
falling asleep with the TV on.

432
00:45:48,411 --> 00:45:51,414
You're just painting these
pictures with your mind,

433
00:45:51,447 --> 00:45:54,851
based on what you hear around
you... the conversations when

434
00:45:54,884 --> 00:45:57,119
people come to visit you, the
sounds of the man screaming

435
00:45:57,152 --> 00:45:59,255
in the bed next to you.

436
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:03,126
Rargh, you get the idea, Bennie.

437
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:05,427
You see.

438
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:10,065
I really can be helpful if you
let me, but here's the thing.

439
00:46:10,099 --> 00:46:12,035
People will go on
with their lives.

440
00:46:12,068 --> 00:46:16,173
Bills will be paid,
and love will be made.

441
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:18,041
Meanwhile, everyone
forgets all about little

442
00:46:18,074 --> 00:46:20,443
Bennie and the bump on his head.

443
00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:37,460
They always forget, Bennie.

444
00:46:42,498 --> 00:46:45,434
Then what am I supposed to do?

445
00:46:45,467 --> 00:46:48,437
Everything that exists
here is inside of you.

446
00:46:48,471 --> 00:46:50,440
You've just ignored it for so
long that what happens here,

447
00:46:50,472 --> 00:46:53,275
it feels like someone
else's nightmare,

448
00:46:53,309 --> 00:46:56,278
but this is your
nightmare, Bennie.

449
00:46:56,311 --> 00:46:59,148
There are no outside
elements, only what

450
00:46:59,181 --> 00:47:02,218
you observe those
elements to be.

451
00:47:02,251 --> 00:47:04,320
The sooner you accept
that, the sooner

452
00:47:04,353 --> 00:47:05,855
you can wake yourself up.

453
00:47:12,094 --> 00:47:15,865
Who the hell are you?

454
00:47:15,898 --> 00:47:18,868
Well, I'm everything
you've ever read,

455
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:21,538
everything you've ever
seen, touched, tasted,

456
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:22,639
heard, or learned.

457
00:47:22,672 --> 00:47:25,175
That, Bennie, is who I am.

458
00:47:29,945 --> 00:47:33,115
No, buddy, a freaking
whack job is who you are.

459
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:42,392
Doctora, Doctora!

460
00:47:42,425 --> 00:47:44,595
Why do I have a feeling
that doesn't lead to heaven?

461
00:49:03,338 --> 00:49:05,241
What is this?

462
00:49:05,708 --> 00:49:07,711
Your way home.

463
00:49:09,478 --> 00:49:10,746
Look.
You don't understand.

464
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:13,048
If you...

465
00:49:21,257 --> 00:49:23,193
Help me, please.

466
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:24,494
No, please.

467
00:49:32,168 --> 00:49:33,702
Damn it, Bennie.

468
00:49:33,735 --> 00:49:35,571
I didn't want this for you.

469
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:38,407
Your mother is a lying whore.

470
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,641
I'm the innocent one.

471
00:49:39,675 --> 00:49:41,445
Please, stop!

472
00:50:32,561 --> 00:50:34,264
Please, no, please.

473
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:35,398
I'm sorry.

474
00:51:01,257 --> 00:51:03,092
You haven't thought
of this in a long time.

475
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:05,161
Why would I want to?

476
00:51:05,193 --> 00:51:08,398
You can't pretend it
didn't happen, Bennie.

477
00:51:08,431 --> 00:51:10,699
Don't give me that bullshit.

478
00:51:10,733 --> 00:51:12,568
It's your fear that
makes him strong.

479
00:51:12,601 --> 00:51:15,605
It's like a darkness
that infects you.

480
00:51:15,637 --> 00:51:17,172
You confronted him once.

481
00:51:17,206 --> 00:51:19,509
And for what?

482
00:51:19,541 --> 00:51:21,844
A dead mother and
a damaged head.

483
00:51:25,213 --> 00:51:27,150
How do I get out of here?

484
00:51:27,182 --> 00:51:30,753
This is yours to control.

485
00:51:47,402 --> 00:51:49,738
Screw this.

486
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:56,746
Piss off!

487
00:52:22,271 --> 00:52:24,274
Mine to control.

488
00:52:37,219 --> 00:52:39,555
Ben, bro...

489
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:46,428
Long time.
I... I'm sorry, bro.

490
00:52:46,461 --> 00:52:49,298
You know, when I
lost my job, I...

491
00:52:49,331 --> 00:52:52,668
I just feel like I needed
to get away, you know?

492
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:57,874
I've been a bad friend.

493
00:52:57,907 --> 00:53:00,510
Here you are, lying
in bed, while I'm

494
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,445
up north, smoking weed.

495
00:53:10,652 --> 00:53:13,755
It's good to see you, Jerry.

496
00:53:13,789 --> 00:53:17,427
It's good to see you, Ben.

497
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:18,728
What do we do now?

498
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:12,581
What have we
got here, brother?

499
00:54:12,614 --> 00:54:15,517
No.

500
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:17,286
That's a pretty lady.

501
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:20,890
Jerry, stay in the car.

502
00:54:20,922 --> 00:54:22,991
Don't worry.
I'm gonna stay right here.

503
00:54:23,025 --> 00:54:24,827
You got this, bro.

504
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:29,466
No, no.
No. No!

505
00:54:32,934 --> 00:54:34,403
Hey!

506
00:55:21,951 --> 00:55:23,552
Señorita.

507
00:55:40,735 --> 00:55:43,739
Yes, I am now.

508
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:58,653
I didn't get your name.

509
00:55:58,686 --> 00:56:03,058
Ben, and yours?

510
00:56:03,092 --> 00:56:05,661
You don't know who I am?

511
00:56:05,693 --> 00:56:08,530
No, ma'am, I don't.

512
00:56:08,563 --> 00:56:14,002
I am Jubilee, and
I'm not a ma'am.

513
00:56:14,036 --> 00:56:16,139
Well, all right.

514
00:56:25,047 --> 00:56:26,148
Jerry.

515
00:56:26,181 --> 00:56:27,516
Yes?

516
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:28,951
This is Jubilee.

517
00:56:28,983 --> 00:56:30,586
Hi, Jerry.

518
00:56:32,121 --> 00:56:35,590
My.

519
00:56:35,623 --> 00:56:38,727
Hi, Jubilee.

520
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,454
Listen, man, we're gonna
be giving her a ride home.

521
00:56:40,455 --> 00:56:42,931
-You want to hop in the back?
-Yeah, yeah.

522
00:56:52,574 --> 00:56:56,044
Hey, I'm here in
town for a while.

523
00:56:56,077 --> 00:56:59,882
I'm actually an actress,
and I'm filming a movie.

524
00:56:59,914 --> 00:57:02,050
An actress?

525
00:57:02,083 --> 00:57:05,086
Well, sorta, I
mean, no one knows

526
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:07,989
who I am outside Latin America,
but even a Mexican movie

527
00:57:08,023 --> 00:57:10,893
is something to see.

528
00:57:10,925 --> 00:57:12,527
We're filming tomorrow
in the park downtown.

529
00:57:12,561 --> 00:57:14,030
Do you know it?

530
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:16,632
We start at 8 in
the morning, but don't

531
00:57:16,664 --> 00:57:18,967
come until 10 or so.

532
00:57:19,001 --> 00:57:22,071
Nothing interesting
happens until then.

533
00:57:22,103 --> 00:57:23,739
Ok.

534
00:57:38,987 --> 00:57:41,056
Shit.

535
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:42,858
What are you doing?

536
00:57:46,929 --> 00:57:48,498
Still here.

537
00:57:53,601 --> 00:57:54,804
Bennie, ju... just stop.

538
00:57:54,836 --> 00:57:56,605
You're... you're wasting time.

539
00:57:59,041 --> 00:58:00,643
You said this world
was mine to control.

540
00:58:00,675 --> 00:58:02,545
I want you gone.

541
00:58:02,577 --> 00:58:03,579
I'm an exception.

542
00:58:03,612 --> 00:58:06,516
I'm part of you.

543
00:58:06,548 --> 00:58:07,983
Whatever, man.

544
00:58:08,016 --> 00:58:09,652
Have you even considered trying
to get out of the situation

545
00:58:09,684 --> 00:58:11,920
that you're in?

546
00:58:11,954 --> 00:58:13,589
I've been busy.

547
00:58:13,621 --> 00:58:17,993
Yeah, busy, playing Jackie Chan
and manufacturing a new car.

548
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:19,528
I hate the bus.

549
00:58:19,561 --> 00:58:22,731
And now a dream girl?

550
00:58:22,764 --> 00:58:24,165
What's wrong with any of that?

551
00:58:24,199 --> 00:58:26,869
You think she would ever
actually talk to you?

552
00:58:26,902 --> 00:58:29,672
This whole thing is a big soap
opera you're trying to produce.

553
00:58:29,704 --> 00:58:31,706
You said I had free reign here.

554
00:58:31,739 --> 00:58:33,975
I never said that.

555
00:58:34,009 --> 00:58:35,144
Look.

556
00:58:35,177 --> 00:58:38,948
Just... will you just let
me enjoy this for a second?

557
00:58:38,981 --> 00:58:41,551
In this world, a
second, it could

558
00:58:41,583 --> 00:58:43,652
be a minute in the real world.

559
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,188
An hour could be a day,
sometimes a week, depending,

560
00:58:46,221 --> 00:58:48,657
and the farther you
get into this world,

561
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:51,092
the harder it is to
get out, the easier it

562
00:58:51,126 --> 00:58:52,428
is to forget about
little Bennie.

563
00:58:56,297 --> 00:58:58,099
Don't worry about it, boss.

564
00:58:58,132 --> 00:59:01,036
I got it covered.

565
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:02,939
And cut the Bennie shit.

566
01:01:33,989 --> 01:01:37,793
At Christmas, my mom will
make our neighbor dress up

567
01:01:37,826 --> 01:01:40,929
like Santa Claus...
him or Elvis.

568
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:42,932
Really?

569
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:47,970
And one time, my mom had our
neighbor dress up like Elvis,

570
01:01:48,003 --> 01:01:50,873
dressed up as Santa.

571
01:01:50,905 --> 01:01:54,342
A Santa Elvis impersonator?

572
01:01:54,376 --> 01:01:57,180
An ideal man, what can I say?

573
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:14,362
So the movie shooting
seems like it's going well.

574
01:02:14,396 --> 01:02:18,534
I have something that I've
been putting off telling you.

575
01:02:18,567 --> 01:02:21,436
Tomorrow is the last day.

576
01:02:21,469 --> 01:02:23,071
What?

577
01:02:23,871 --> 01:02:26,341
I should have said something.

578
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:29,043
It's just that I've been
having such a great time

579
01:02:29,077 --> 01:02:31,781
with you, and...

580
01:02:31,813 --> 01:02:34,016
Then what?

581
01:02:34,048 --> 01:02:36,184
I don't know.

582
01:02:36,217 --> 01:02:41,389
I guess I will go
back to Mexico City,

583
01:02:41,422 --> 01:02:48,363
or maybe I will hang out
here a couple more days.

584
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:31,606
So I was thinking
about your offer

585
01:03:31,639 --> 01:03:34,509
the other night, about staying
around a couple of days

586
01:03:34,543 --> 01:03:39,181
after you finish shooting,
and I thought that maybe we

587
01:03:39,213 --> 01:03:42,418
could get away for a couple
of days, maybe go to the beach

588
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:45,186
and get some rest.

589
01:03:45,219 --> 01:03:48,356
Seth called me this morning.

590
01:03:48,389 --> 01:03:50,125
I got an offer to
do another movie.

591
01:03:50,157 --> 01:03:53,295
That's great.

592
01:03:53,327 --> 01:03:59,999
In London, it's the
role of a lifetime, Ben.

593
01:04:00,501 --> 01:04:04,539
It's my first chance to get
noticed outside of Mexico.

594
01:04:04,572 --> 01:04:06,174
The director saw me on
a cell phone commercial,

595
01:04:06,208 --> 01:04:08,077
and he called Seth.

596
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:09,612
Don't take it.

597
01:04:09,644 --> 01:04:12,981
What?

598
01:04:13,014 --> 01:04:16,085
I know that we haven't known
each other for very long,

599
01:04:16,117 --> 01:04:17,920
but I can barely remember
what my life was like before I

600
01:04:17,952 --> 01:04:20,922
met you the other night.

601
01:04:20,956 --> 01:04:25,561
If you leave now, I'm not sure
we'll ever have this back.

602
01:04:25,594 --> 01:04:29,431
This role is a
dream for me, Ben,

603
01:04:29,463 --> 01:04:32,902
and besides, we hardly
know each other.

604
01:04:32,934 --> 01:04:35,637
Exactly, and as
soon as you leave,

605
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:39,307
you'll forget all about little
Ben and his mediocre life.

606
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:41,376
Ben.

607
01:04:41,409 --> 01:04:44,312
If you take that role,
Jubilee, you will regret it.

608
01:04:44,346 --> 01:04:47,449
I have to get to set.

609
01:04:47,481 --> 01:04:50,251
Of course, walk away.

610
01:04:50,284 --> 01:04:52,053
You're not being fair to me.

611
01:04:52,086 --> 01:04:53,655
Stop being a child.

612
01:04:53,688 --> 01:04:55,257
I'm not being fair?

613
01:04:55,289 --> 01:04:57,393
This is my life.

614
01:04:57,425 --> 01:04:59,094
This is my fantasy.

615
01:04:59,126 --> 01:05:02,597
You're supposed to
be doing what I want.

616
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:05,333
Whatever, we'll talk
about this later.

617
01:05:05,367 --> 01:05:07,036
No, please.

618
01:05:08,536 --> 01:05:10,038
Get down!

619
01:05:16,577 --> 01:05:18,447
Jubilee.

620
01:05:18,713 --> 01:05:20,382
Jubilee.

621
01:05:33,527 --> 01:05:37,165
Man, how did I mess this up?

622
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:44,005
Well, I mean, probably
by yelling at her,

623
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:46,442
and then you tackled
her to the ground.

624
01:05:46,474 --> 01:05:50,645
And then you scared the
shit out of her, right out.

625
01:05:50,679 --> 01:05:56,719
Bro, bro, you need
to just talk to her.

626
01:05:56,751 --> 01:05:59,020
Tell her you're
dumb ass is sorry.

627
01:05:59,054 --> 01:06:00,021
I don't know, man.

628
01:06:00,054 --> 01:06:02,590
She wouldn't even talk to me.

629
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:07,395
Sh... ok, y'all can't
end like this, all right?

630
01:06:07,429 --> 01:06:12,735
I mean, she's your
dream girl, man.

631
01:06:12,768 --> 01:06:15,103
Too bad you ain't
the man of hers.

632
01:06:16,737 --> 01:06:18,539
-Jerry, wait.
-Bro.

633
01:06:18,572 --> 01:06:21,643
-What?
-Damn.

634
01:06:21,675 --> 01:06:24,012
I said, too bad you're
not the man of her dreams.

635
01:06:27,048 --> 01:06:28,617
-What are you doing?
-Thanks, Jerry.

636
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:30,318
What the hell?

637
01:06:30,351 --> 01:06:33,321
Bro's weird.

638
01:06:42,097 --> 01:06:45,034
My gosh.

639
01:08:26,234 --> 01:08:27,803
It's not supposed
to be like this.

640
01:08:32,873 --> 01:08:38,447
Jubilee, you... you
didn't get on the plane.

641
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:40,448
Seth called me and
told me you came

642
01:08:40,481 --> 01:08:43,719
to set dressed like
an evil Santa Elvis.

643
01:08:48,289 --> 01:08:51,527
I had see for myself.

644
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,295
Ben.

645
01:08:59,501 --> 01:09:02,371
I'm so sorry for everything, for... for
trying to control everything and for...

646
01:09:02,404 --> 01:09:04,606
Stop, stop, stop.

647
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:06,675
I was being selfish.

648
01:09:06,707 --> 01:09:07,775
I want you to take that role.

649
01:09:07,809 --> 01:09:09,912
No, it's not important.

650
01:09:09,944 --> 01:09:11,512
It is important.

651
01:09:11,546 --> 01:09:13,382
It's important to you.

652
01:09:13,414 --> 01:09:16,417
I want you to take it.

653
01:09:16,451 --> 01:09:20,521
Only if you have
a spot next to me.

654
01:09:20,555 --> 01:09:22,191
Come to London?

655
01:09:31,298 --> 01:09:33,402
Man, I needed to get
out of that jumpsuit.

656
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:36,405
It kept riding up my crack.

657
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:38,474
Hey, let's go buy the tickets.

658
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:43,679
What was that?

659
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:44,947
I don't know.

660
01:09:54,989 --> 01:09:56,324
Jubilee!

661
01:09:59,961 --> 01:10:02,297
Ben.

662
01:10:02,329 --> 01:10:04,600
Jubilee.

663
01:10:39,934 --> 01:10:41,637
Always in the way, Bennie.

664
01:10:48,076 --> 01:10:51,779
So when were you gonna
introduce me to your girlfriend?

665
01:11:02,323 --> 01:11:05,860
She smells good.
No!

666
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:16,038
Tastes good, too... no doubt in
my mind, Ben, she's a keeper.

667
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:19,908
No.
No.

668
01:11:24,045 --> 01:11:28,884
What are you doing
here, Ben, you little shit?

669
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:33,555
Are you trying to be a man?

670
01:11:33,587 --> 01:11:35,791
Did you forget how that
worked out for you last time,

671
01:11:35,823 --> 01:11:37,725
Bennie Boo Boo?

672
01:11:37,759 --> 01:11:38,793
Come here.

673
01:11:41,762 --> 01:11:44,865
Now, where did we leave off?

674
01:11:44,899 --> 01:11:48,704
Bennie, Bennie...

675
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:53,841
Bennie, please, help me.

676
01:11:53,875 --> 01:11:55,010
No.

677
01:11:57,145 --> 01:11:58,814
Get her out of here.

678
01:11:58,846 --> 01:12:00,782
Do we have to do
this every time?

679
01:12:00,814 --> 01:12:03,719
You ruined my life.

680
01:12:03,752 --> 01:12:04,853
Not bad, tiger.

681
01:12:13,694 --> 01:12:17,965
That was cute, you
pathetic little shit.

682
01:12:17,998 --> 01:12:19,800
You know what I can't believe?

683
01:12:19,833 --> 01:12:22,503
I can't believe I spawned
such worthless shit.

684
01:12:25,472 --> 01:12:28,443
You can't get rid of me, Ben.

685
01:12:28,475 --> 01:12:32,380
I made you who you are... a
brain-dead, retarded, little

686
01:12:32,413 --> 01:12:34,682
boy, too stupid to be loved.

687
01:12:46,493 --> 01:12:49,831
Jubilee, are you ok?
Are you ok?

688
01:12:49,863 --> 01:12:50,965
Go.
Get out of here.

689
01:12:50,998 --> 01:12:53,835
Go, go.

690
01:12:53,868 --> 01:12:56,905
Mom, Mom, I'm so sorry.

691
01:12:59,841 --> 01:13:00,776
Come on!

692
01:13:01,176 --> 01:13:03,045
Come on.
Come on.

693
01:13:06,948 --> 01:13:09,851
Glad you decided to come
to this place, Bennie.

694
01:13:09,884 --> 01:13:11,520
It'll be good for
you once we dissect

695
01:13:11,552 --> 01:13:13,055
your mother and your
precious, little whore.

696
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:17,726
Help me decide.

697
01:13:19,761 --> 01:13:21,397
Help me decide.

698
01:13:23,530 --> 01:13:26,600
Which piece?

699
01:13:28,936 --> 01:13:31,038
Which piece first?

700
01:13:38,947 --> 01:13:41,583
Cute, boy, what do you
think you're doing?

701
01:13:54,561 --> 01:13:55,997
Get out of here, Ma.

702
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:05,774
All my life, you told me I was
shit, and I hated you for it.

703
01:14:05,806 --> 01:14:09,109
Now I see that you're nothing.

704
01:14:09,143 --> 01:14:13,215
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

705
01:14:13,247 --> 01:14:15,115
What, you think this is over?

706
01:14:15,149 --> 01:14:16,785
This will never be over!

707
01:14:16,818 --> 01:14:18,753
I own you.

708
01:14:18,786 --> 01:14:20,721
I own your fear.

709
01:14:20,755 --> 01:14:22,690
Where are you going?

710
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:25,226
What are you doing?

711
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:27,463
I'm getting rid of this.

712
01:14:31,899 --> 01:14:35,804
Ben!
Ben!

713
01:14:44,145 --> 01:14:46,181
Ben!

714
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:04,298
I knew you had it in
you, Bennie... sorry, Ben.

715
01:15:04,332 --> 01:15:06,835
It's time to go home.

716
01:15:06,868 --> 01:15:08,170
I'm staying here.

717
01:15:10,137 --> 01:15:13,608
But this is what you wanted.

718
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:14,875
This isn't what I wanted.

719
01:15:14,908 --> 01:15:16,978
Really?

720
01:15:17,011 --> 01:15:19,881
This whole world was yours
to control, and at the moment

721
01:15:19,913 --> 01:15:23,717
you needed to, you
stopped your father.

722
01:15:23,751 --> 01:15:26,887
You knew couldn't come
here without a... a reason.

723
01:15:26,921 --> 01:15:28,023
Jubilee is what you
needed to come here.

724
01:15:28,055 --> 01:15:29,757
No.

725
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:31,560
She helped you
remember the one thing

726
01:15:31,592 --> 01:15:33,894
you had spent your whole
life trying to forget.

727
01:15:33,927 --> 01:15:38,567
You did it, Ben, and now
it's time to go home.

728
01:15:43,604 --> 01:15:44,738
This is the life that I want.

729
01:15:44,771 --> 01:15:47,676
This isn't real.

730
01:15:54,381 --> 01:15:56,684
It's real to me.

731
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:29,818
Ben, the suitcase.

732
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:31,885
-Right.
-The suitcase!

733
01:16:31,918 --> 01:16:33,354
Where is it?

734
01:16:33,387 --> 01:16:35,356
It is behind the...

735
01:16:37,024 --> 01:16:38,893
Where is it?

736
01:16:38,926 --> 01:16:42,396
It's behind
the... behind the couch.

737
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:43,798
Right.

738
01:16:48,235 --> 01:16:49,871
Ben!

739
01:17:39,052 --> 01:17:41,055
Want to meet your son?

740
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:53,669
He's beautiful.

741
01:17:57,305 --> 01:17:58,840
He's got your nose.

742
01:18:05,378 --> 01:18:07,748
Ben.

743
01:18:07,782 --> 01:18:09,417
Ben?

744
01:18:09,449 --> 01:18:11,853
Baby, are you all right?

745
01:18:11,886 --> 01:18:12,987
Doctor.

746
01:18:20,194 --> 01:18:22,731
Ben, baby, what's wrong, baby?

747
01:18:22,764 --> 01:18:24,498
Baby?
Hey, hey, take it easy.

748
01:18:24,532 --> 01:18:26,234
Ben, what's wrong, baby?

749
01:18:26,266 --> 01:18:29,336
No, no, no, Ben, Ben, hey.

750
01:18:29,369 --> 01:18:32,340
Baby, Ben, no, come on, baby.

751
01:18:32,372 --> 01:18:34,108
Don't do this to me.

752
01:18:34,141 --> 01:18:35,376
Stop.

753
01:18:35,408 --> 01:18:36,810
No, Ben, come on.

754
01:18:36,844 --> 01:18:38,346
I need you.

755
01:18:38,378 --> 01:18:40,814
Ben, no, stop.

756
01:18:40,847 --> 01:18:43,917
Ben, no, I'm
talking to you, Ben.

757
01:18:43,951 --> 01:18:46,820
Please, don't go, baby.

758
01:18:46,854 --> 01:18:48,390
Ben, please.
