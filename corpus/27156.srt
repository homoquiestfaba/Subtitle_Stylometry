It is a miracle. A miracle.

367

Do I know you?

368
00:19:50,503 --> 00:19:52,562
Do you not recognize me,
my lady?

369
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:55,438
I am the Count of
Malfete and Papincourt...

You're who?

373
00:20:01,547 --> 00:20:05,779
And I am Andre le Pate,
valet of the count.

374
00:20:05,818 --> 00:20:08,616
Please, forgive me
for what I did to you...

375
00:20:08,654 --> 00:20:09,712
my dear Rosalind.

376
00:20:09,755 --> 00:20:13,851
My name isn't Rosalind.
It's Julia.

377
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:15,588
No! You are my Rosalind.

378
00:20:15,628 --> 00:20:19,325

on our wedding day.

379

Please, my love,
see for yourself.

381

You see?

382
00:20:30,209 --> 00:20:33,667
It is the color of wheat
on a summer's day.

383
00:20:33,712 --> 00:20:35,907
The color of candle light.

384
00:20:37,616 --> 00:20:39,516

-Rosalind!

You'll be safer outside!

Do not be afraid!

389

JULIA:
That's our family motto.

397
00:21:06,745 --> 00:21:08,713
This man is my cousin.

398
00:21:09,949 --> 00:21:14,181
It's in here.
You see, I thought he was dead.

399
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:18,383
He disappeared when a storm...

400
00:21:18,424 --> 00:21:20,984
capsized his yacht
during the Admiral's Cup.

401
00:21:21,026 --> 00:21:23,119
They never recovered
his body...

402
00:21:23,162 --> 00:21:25,653
so, of course,
declared him dead.

403
00:21:25,698 --> 00:21:28,462
He was a very distant
French cousin of mine...

404
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,061
but as the last living Malfete,
I inherited his estate.

405

If he's your cousin...

406
00:21:33,272 --> 00:21:34,796
what do you want me
to do with him?

407
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,864
ANDRE: Sire...

408
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:39,537
Why does Lady Rosalind
call herself Julia...

409
00:21:39,578 --> 00:21:42,604
and allow us
to be beaten and chained?

410
00:21:49,922 --> 00:21:51,549
Peasant...

411
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:54,150
this is not our time.

412
00:21:54,193 --> 00:21:57,788
THIBAULT: The wizard
did not send us into the past.

413
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:01,789
He sent us
into the next millennium.

414
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:07,067
We are thirty generations
removed from Malfete.

415
00:22:07,106 --> 00:22:11,167
Julia is not my beloved.

416
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,940
She's my descendant.

417
00:22:13,979 --> 00:22:15,970
Descendant?

418

HUNTER:
Hey, bunny. What's up?

423
00:22:30,696 --> 00:22:32,857
JULIA: Thibault Malfete
just showed up at the museum.

424
00:22:32,898 --> 00:22:34,729
HUNTER: Thibault Malfete?

425
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:37,930
That's impossible.
Isn't he supposed to be...

426
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,767
-I know.
-Are you sure it's him?

427
00:22:39,805 --> 00:22:41,170
He looks exactly
like his photos.

428
00:22:41,206 --> 00:22:43,174
JULIA: Hunter,
he quoted the family motto.

429
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:46,473
Does he know yet that
we're selling his entire estate?

430
00:22:46,512 --> 00:22:48,275
JULIA: Well, it's hard
to say what he knows.

431
00:22:48,313 --> 00:22:50,804
He's a little strange.

432
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:52,817
Hunter, this is terrible.

433
00:22:52,851 --> 00:22:54,478
I mean, it's wonderful
that he's alive...

434
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,852
but it's terrible that
we started to sell the estate.

435
00:22:56,889 --> 00:22:58,857
Oh, God, I feel awful.

436
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:00,222
HUNTER: The English courts
declared him dead.

437
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:01,886
We're well within
our legal rights.

438
00:23:01,927 --> 00:23:04,327
How were we supposed to know
he was still alive?

439
00:23:04,363 --> 00:23:06,297
Has he mentioned anything
about money?

440
00:23:06,331 --> 00:23:07,889
JULIA: Money?

441
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:10,197
How can you worry about money
at a time like this?

442
00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:11,702
No, I'm just
worrying about you.

443
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:15,173
You don't handle surprises well.
Where is your cousin now?

444
00:23:15,207 --> 00:23:18,301
He and this friend of his
are downstairs with security.

Why don't we bring them
home with us tonight?

00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:31,825
Who is this?

718
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:34,771
I'm Andre le Pate.
I have big balls...

719
00:36:34,806 --> 00:36:37,536
and my ass breathes fire.

720
00:36:37,575 --> 00:36:39,509
Wow. That must hurt.

721
00:36:39,544 --> 00:36:41,512
-Hello.
-Hello?

722
00:36:41,546 --> 00:36:42,535
HUNTER:I told you
never to call me here.

723
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,774
Well, I forgot.

724
00:36:43,815 --> 00:36:46,477
-Hello! Enter!
-Somebody there with you?

725
00:36:46,518 --> 00:36:49,009
[Blasting]

726
00:36:49,053 --> 00:36:51,180
-Aah!
-Jesus!

727
00:36:51,222 --> 00:36:54,555
HUNTER: Hangup the damn phone,
or I'll call the police!

728
00:36:54,592 --> 00:36:57,288
I think he hung up the phone.

729
00:36:57,328 --> 00:37:00,388
It was Thibault's little
retarded homuncular assistant.

730
00:37:00,431 --> 00:37:01,864
Look, this is dangerous.

731
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,061
I'll call you back
after Julia goes to bed, OK?

732
00:37:08,273 --> 00:37:10,207
THIBAULT: Lady Julia.

733
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:15,035
You are more than a rose.

734
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:19,413
You are love's own flower.

735
00:37:20,952 --> 00:37:23,921
Come on.
That's ridiculous.

736
00:37:23,955 --> 00:37:27,584
No, I just--This old thing,
I threw it on.

737
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:29,217
I haven't worn it
in a couple of years...

738
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:33,720
but I guess I should learn
how to take a compliment.

739
00:37:34,766 --> 00:37:35,755
Thank you.

740
00:37:37,702 --> 00:37:38,691
Almost.

741
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:42,529
Thank you.

742
00:37:42,574 --> 00:37:44,906
Much better.

743
00:37:47,378 --> 00:37:48,436
Kissing cousins.

744
00:37:50,214 --> 00:37:52,239
Ooh la la.

745
00:38:04,562 --> 00:38:06,325
I don't think
that I've ever seen anyone...

746
00:38:06,364 --> 00:38:10,027
eat a steak
in two bites before.

747
00:38:12,604 --> 00:38:14,595
Ah.

748
00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:19,936
ANDRE: Thank you, master!

749
00:38:19,978 --> 00:38:21,878
[Chuckling]

750
00:38:21,913 --> 00:38:23,904
ANDRE: Be blessed!

751
00:38:23,948 --> 00:38:25,540
MAN: I can assure you...

752
00:38:37,128 --> 00:38:38,254
ANDRE: Thank you!

753
00:38:38,296 --> 00:38:40,890
Like some more
truffle sauce with that?

754
00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:47,463
[Kissing]

755
00:38:47,505 --> 00:38:50,565
MAN: Excuse me,
but the gentleman...

756
00:38:50,608 --> 00:38:52,803
can't eat off the floor.

757
00:38:52,844 --> 00:38:55,677
He's not a gentleman.
He's my servant...

758
00:38:55,713 --> 00:38:58,011
and he's not worthy
of our company.

759
00:38:58,049 --> 00:38:59,346
Thank you.

760
00:38:59,384 --> 00:39:01,852
I'm truly sorry, sir.
Andre, would you please...

761
00:39:01,886 --> 00:39:04,855
ANDRE: No, no, milady.
It is not possible.

762
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:05,913
JULIA: Please.

763
00:39:07,258 --> 00:39:10,421
Thibault, please, will you
let him sit at the table?

764
00:39:10,461 --> 00:39:11,519
For me?

765
00:39:13,598 --> 00:39:15,862
I will please you,
lovely one.

766
00:39:18,002 --> 00:39:19,799
Obey, foolish wart.

767
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:25,598
[All applaud]

768
00:39:26,844 --> 00:39:28,141
MAN: Thank you.

769
00:39:30,682 --> 00:39:34,618
HUNTER: And you were worried
they wouldn't be comfortable.

770
00:39:37,388 --> 00:39:39,379
[Slurping]

771
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:46,019
Actually, the floor wasn't
such a bad place for him.

772
00:39:46,064 --> 00:39:47,429
Easier to hose down.

773
00:39:47,465 --> 00:39:50,400
ANDRE: Cheese!
Very good cheese!

774
00:39:53,037 --> 00:39:54,231
HUNTER: Andre,
what are you doing?

775
00:39:54,272 --> 00:39:56,832
What are you doing?
Andre? No, no!

776
00:39:56,874 --> 00:40:00,173
-Andre, no.
-No. Bad!

777
00:40:00,211 --> 00:40:03,339
HUNTER:
Hey. Sit down. Eat this.

778
00:40:03,381 --> 00:40:05,349
JULIA: Hunter, could you--

779
00:40:10,354 --> 00:40:11,514
No. This is for dessert.
All right?

780
00:40:11,556 --> 00:40:13,751
WAITER:
Please, sir, please.

781
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:16,385
HUNTER: I'm sorry.
I'm terribly sorry.

782
00:40:16,427 --> 00:40:19,419
Just add it to the check.
OK, all right? Thank you.

783
00:40:19,464 --> 00:40:22,262
You eat this after dinner.
Allright?

784
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,268
No, it's allright.
I'm terribly sorry.

785
00:40:24,302 --> 00:40:25,997
Just add it to the bill.
Thank you.

786
00:40:26,037 --> 00:40:27,402
WAITER: All right.

787
00:40:31,909 --> 00:40:33,843
Do I have something on my face?

788
00:40:33,878 --> 00:40:37,678
You remind me of
the daughter of a king.

789
00:40:37,715 --> 00:40:39,205
Thank you.

790
00:40:41,152 --> 00:40:44,019
HUNTER: On the subject
of Julia's noble ancestry...

791
00:40:44,055 --> 00:40:45,955
you do understand why she was
granted control of the estate?

792
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:50,450
Julia is a Malfete.
Everything I have is hers.

793
00:40:50,495 --> 00:40:53,362
So you have no objection
if she retains control?

794
00:40:53,397 --> 00:40:55,524
-No.
-Wonderful.

795
00:40:55,566 --> 00:40:57,431
I'm sure you'll be
very pleased with our plans.

796
00:40:57,468 --> 00:40:59,129
HUNTER:
They're going to make us--

797
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:02,037
I mean you and Julia--
very wealthy.

798
00:41:02,073 --> 00:41:05,770
I am already wealthy.
I own hundreds of horses...

799
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,801
ten chests of pepper,
four hundred bags of wool...

800
00:41:07,845 --> 00:41:11,178
and fifty barrels
of Spanish olives.

801
00:41:11,215 --> 00:41:12,580
And you own me, sire.

802
00:41:12,617 --> 00:41:15,108
Yes, but you have no value.

803
00:41:16,353 --> 00:41:17,713
That is true.

804
00:41:20,057 --> 00:41:22,753
[Burps loudly]

805
00:41:22,794 --> 00:41:23,886
Excuse you.

806
00:41:25,062 --> 00:41:27,826

Leave nothing for the devil!

808
00:41:29,534 --> 00:41:32,128
-Did you hear that?
-Yes, I did, sweetheart.

809
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:34,468
They're not in very good health,
all right?

810
00:41:34,505 --> 00:41:37,599
So, just try to ignore it,
if you can.

811
00:41:37,642 --> 00:41:38,609
[Sighs]

812
00:41:38,643 --> 00:41:39,769
-Sire.
-What?

813
00:41:39,811 --> 00:41:41,301
ANDRE:
I want to make pee-pee.

814
00:41:41,345 --> 00:41:43,404
-Ah! You want to pee?
-Yes.

815
00:41:43,447 --> 00:41:44,505
Outside!

816
00:41:44,549 --> 00:41:46,414
Outside?
But, sire...

817
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:47,974
I could be
eaten by the wolves.

818
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:50,852
THIBAULT:
Find a torch! Idiot.

819
00:41:52,123 --> 00:41:54,284
ANDRE: Find a torch.

820
00:41:56,294 --> 00:41:58,990
Andre has such simple needs.
I think that's great.

821
00:42:06,771 --> 00:42:08,762
[Crash]

822
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,239

824
00:42:27,592 --> 00:42:29,890
Oh, it is beautiful.

825
00:42:29,927 --> 00:42:32,521
The water comes out
by itself. Ha!

826
00:42:32,563 --> 00:42:35,794
[Andre laughing]

827
00:42:38,636 --> 00:42:41,002
It is a magic fountain.

828
00:42:43,941 --> 00:42:45,932
Look at this! Mmm.

829
00:42:45,977 --> 00:42:48,878
It smells just like the forest.

830
00:42:48,913 --> 00:42:52,076
ANDRE: All the forest
is in the small wheel.

831
00:42:52,116 --> 00:42:53,140
Mmm. Smell it!

832
00:42:53,184 --> 00:42:54,708
No. No, thank you.

833
00:42:54,752 --> 00:42:56,151
You don't want to smell it?

834
00:42:56,187 --> 00:42:57,586
Enjoy yourself.

835
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:02,820
The castle's a wreck.

836
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,487
HUNTER: So I'm helping her
divide the estate up...

837
00:43:04,528 --> 00:43:06,655
into more manageable,
profitable chunks.

838
00:43:06,697 --> 00:43:09,427
We're selling the art
and various high-end pieces...

839
00:43:09,467 --> 00:43:10,934
through an outlet here.

840
00:43:10,968 --> 00:43:13,436
Essentially, I'm protecting her.
I see that as my role.

841
00:43:13,471 --> 00:43:15,063
And the land?

842
00:43:15,106 --> 00:43:17,199
I decided
we should sell that, too.

843
00:43:17,241 --> 00:43:18,765
THIBAULT:
It is not for you to decide.

844
00:43:18,809 --> 00:43:22,006
Only Lady Julia
can say what will be done.

845
00:43:22,046 --> 00:43:24,810
I speak for both
Julia and myself.

846
00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:27,409
THIBAULT: You cannot possibly
speak for a Malfete.

847
00:43:27,451 --> 00:43:29,419
What are your wishes, milady?

848
00:43:29,453 --> 00:43:32,547
Well, um...

849
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:36,219
I guess I'd like
to think about it...

850
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,693
a little bit more,
actually.

851
00:43:37,728 --> 00:43:39,195

Andre does not need a bed.

884
00:46:01,539 --> 00:46:03,769
He will be happy
with some straw.

-Yes.
-We're out of straw.

886

MAN: Miss Malfete,
this is Francois le Combier.

1602
01:22:21,379 --> 01:22:23,643
He's the attorney
handling the French interest...

1603
01:22:23,681 --> 01:22:25,205
in the estate.

1604
01:22:25,249 --> 01:22:28,844
He knows the history of the
castle even better than I do.

1605
01:22:28,886 --> 01:22:30,751
Francois,
perhaps you would like...

1606
01:22:30,788 --> 01:22:33,518
to be Miss Malfete's
guide today?

1607
01:22:33,558 --> 01:22:35,549
FRANCOIS: It will be
my great pleasure.

1608
01:22:35,593 --> 01:22:36,753
Mademoiselle.

1609
01:22:36,794 --> 01:22:39,627
Merci.

1610
01:22:39,664 --> 01:22:41,063
[Andre screaming]

1611
01:22:41,098 --> 01:22:43,191
CHER SINGING: So let them say
your hair's too long

1612
01:22:43,234 --> 01:22:44,565
'Cause I don't care

1613
01:22:44,602 --> 01:22:47,867
With you
I can't go wrong...

1614
01:22:47,905 --> 01:22:49,702
I have one small worry.

1615
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:51,173
What's that?

1616
01:22:51,208 --> 01:22:52,937
Who's going to protect me
from the devil?

1617
01:22:52,977 --> 01:22:54,842
Ha ha ha!

1618
01:22:54,879 --> 01:22:57,143
You got me, don't ya?

1619
01:22:57,181 --> 01:22:59,547
Yes! I got you, babe.

1620
01:22:59,584 --> 01:23:00,881
You got me, babe.

1621
01:23:00,918 --> 01:23:02,886
Yeah. I got you, babe!

1622
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:04,785
[Singing]
I got you, babe

1623
01:23:04,822 --> 01:23:06,016
[Both screaming]

1624
01:23:06,057 --> 01:23:07,251
I got you, babe

1625
01:23:08,693 --> 01:23:10,354
I got you, babe

1626
01:23:11,862 --> 01:23:17,823
I got you, babe

1627
01:23:17,868 --> 01:23:21,599
Your time will come

1628
01:23:29,013 --> 01:23:32,915
Your time will come

1629
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:38,815
Have you been a fool
opposed to the groove?

1630
01:23:38,856 --> 01:23:42,417
And have you been a slave
to the rhythm?

1631
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:46,419
You've been abused,
forgotten, and used

1632
01:23:46,464 --> 01:23:50,093
Made quite
a few bad decisions

1633
01:23:50,134 --> 01:23:53,865
Don't let this happen
to you, baby

1634
01:23:53,904 --> 01:23:55,531
Look to yourself

1635
01:23:55,573 --> 01:23:59,566
See that there is no limit
to what you can do

1636
01:23:59,610 --> 01:24:01,805
Get it right

1637
01:24:01,846 --> 01:24:05,475
Just keep on singin'

1638
01:24:05,516 --> 01:24:08,917
La di da di da

1639
01:24:08,953 --> 01:24:12,946
The band keeps playin'

La di da di da di da

1641
01:24:16,927 --> 01:24:20,226
Just hold your head up

1642
01:24:20,264 --> 01:24:24,166
Yeah, what's done is done

1643
01:24:24,201 --> 01:24:28,035
The hands are turnin'

1644
01:24:28,072 --> 01:24:33,669
I know somehow,
some way

1645
01:24:33,711 --> 01:24:40,139
Your time will come

1646
01:24:44,055 --> 01:24:48,924
Your time will come, yeah

1647
01:24:53,931 --> 01:24:57,867
Lost in the silence,
don't turn to violence

1648
01:24:57,902 --> 01:25:01,303
Make no mistake,
there's a heaven

1649
01:25:01,338 --> 01:25:05,297
Waiting to greet you,
longing to meet you

1650
01:25:05,342 --> 01:25:08,834
Don't worry,
your time has come

1651
01:25:08,879 --> 01:25:11,677
I'll go the distance
with you

1652
01:25:11,716 --> 01:25:14,583
Only one thing I'm asking

1653
01:25:14,618 --> 01:25:18,418
One little task
that I want you to do

1654
01:25:18,456 --> 01:25:22,392
It's true, it's true,
it's true, it's true, it's true

1655
01:25:22,426 --> 01:25:26,055
Just keep on singin'

1656

La di da di da di da

1660
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:40,604
Again,
just hold your head up

1661
01:25:40,644 --> 01:25:43,841
Yeah,
what's done is done

1662
01:25:43,881 --> 01:25:45,109
Yeah, yeah

1663
01:25:45,149 --> 01:25:48,414
The hands are turnin'

1664
01:25:48,452 --> 01:25:54,413
I know somehow,
some way

1665
01:25:54,458 --> 01:25:58,087

Your time will come, yeah
