00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,300
THE LOST TRIBE

2
00:01:48,755 --> 00:01:50,673
We found something!

3
00:01:50,769 --> 00:01:52,782
We found something!

4
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:04,367
That was it wasn't it?

5
00:02:04,887 --> 00:02:06,064
It's pretty smelly.

6
00:02:10,907 --> 00:02:13,592
Only God can save us.

7
00:02:35,805 --> 00:02:37,976
LINK RECOVERED.
AWAITING INSTRUCTIONS

8
00:03:02,788 --> 00:03:05,089
Sir?

9
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,583
Glad you could make it father.

10
00:03:11,898 --> 00:03:15,638
Find her and she will lead you
to the rest of her team.

11
00:03:15,734 --> 00:03:17,460
And wait
for my instructions.

12
00:03:17,556 --> 00:03:19,857
Yes, sir.

13
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:31,272
<i>Our Father which art in heaven ..</i>

14
00:03:31,465 --> 00:03:33,701
<i>hallowed be thy name ...</i>

15
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:35,780
<i>Thy kingdom come ...</i>

16
00:03:36,298 --> 00:03:38,121
<i>Thy will be done ...</i>

17
00:03:38,347 --> 00:03:40,736
<i>on earth as it is in heaven,</i>

18
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:44,388
<i>Give us our
daily bread ...</i>

19
00:03:44,589 --> 00:03:46,476
<i>and forgive us our trespasses ...</i>

20
00:03:46,637 --> 00:03:50,216
<i>as we forgive
those who trespass against us ...</i>

21
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:55,399
<i>lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil,</i>

22
00:03:55,888 --> 00:04:00,330
<i>In the name of the Father, Son
and the Holy Spirit,,,</i>

23
00:04:01,202 --> 00:04:02,184
<i>- Amen,
- Amen,</i>

24
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,564
Contact! Contact!
Alpha Team here!

25
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,277
- Bravo, cover the north!
- What? What?

26
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:05,557
- Where?.
- Ready to shoot!

27
00:05:05,724 --> 00:05:06,871
Do not shoot!

28
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,989
I repeat, do not shoot!

29
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:40,443
How many people
are in your group?

30
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:46,964
Just tell him!

31
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,649
Let me handle it.

32
00:05:49,745 --> 00:05:53,485
Stay, stay.
Come here.

33
00:05:53,581 --> 00:05:56,458
What is all this crap all over you?

34
00:05:58,856 --> 00:06:00,294
No?

35
00:06:02,692 --> 00:06:04,130
How many people
are in your group?

36
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,747
How many are there and where are they?

37
00:06:15,254 --> 00:06:17,556
Who are you?

38
00:06:33,858 --> 00:06:35,749
<i>Do you have any scuba gear
onboard here</i>

39
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:36,447
<i>Yes,</i>

40
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,804
-  Here you go guys.
- Yes

41
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,105
Yum..yum..yum..yum..yum
Crustaceans.

42
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:44,886
What are you taking?

43
00:06:44,982 --> 00:06:49,106
Just be thankful you don't have
to do a wheat crash enema every morning.

44
00:06:49,202 --> 00:06:51,983
Do we have to talk about
your test result, Joseph?

45
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,284
The Universe is trying
to tell you something.

46
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,065
You may start eating
like a human being.

47
00:06:57,161 --> 00:07:00,038
Are you sure that stuff won't give you
the old *whistle*

48
00:07:00,134 --> 00:07:01,420
Actually...

49
00:07:01,425 --> 00:07:03,107
You may be surprised.

50
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,861
She can't take it, it's ...

51
00:07:08,957 --> 00:07:10,313
I'm just kidding, honey.

52
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:12,359
Sexy.

53
00:07:15,861 --> 00:07:19,122
Isn't that a beauty?

54
00:07:19,218 --> 00:07:21,519
I still can't believe I've been having sex with that??.

55
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:23,629
Yeah, neither can I.

56
00:07:23,663 --> 00:07:25,643
I'm sorry mate, you were saying?

57
00:07:25,739 --> 00:07:28,808
So I thought that broadband
penetration in the Philippines was low?

58
00:07:28,903 --> 00:07:33,890
Big time, big time, it's all about the broadband
these days, Joe. As you know.

59
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:37,788
So what do you think?

60
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:41,082
Ahhh, it's ok ...

61
00:07:41,178 --> 00:07:42,602
the market that we are targeting ...

62
00:07:42,705 --> 00:07:44,151
... is tiny.

63
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:46,836
Not to mention that your main competition
is Bi-tunes.

64
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:49,042
How did William Wallace
defeat the English?

65
00:07:49,138 --> 00:07:50,768
What?

66
00:07:50,864 --> 00:07:53,136
How did William Wallace
defeat the English?

67
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,659
Who the hell cares?
What does that have to do with anything?

68
00:07:55,755 --> 00:07:57,577
Just answer the question.

69
00:07:57,673 --> 00:08:00,837
I'm sorry there steroid boy.
I don't watch anti-Semitic films.

70
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:03,139
One word: numbers.

71
00:08:03,235 --> 00:08:06,366
He united the little people promised them
freedom over tyranny ...

72
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,701
and outnumbered the English
two to one.

73
00:08:08,797 --> 00:08:10,235
I like those numbers mate.

74
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:12,633
We're not just going after
the Philippines, Joe.

75
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:17,523
Malaysia, Singapore, India,
Indonesia, China.

76
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:21,038
That's over 3 billion
potential subscribers.

77
00:08:21,072 --> 00:08:23,853
We signed an exclusive
with PLDT last week.

78
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:27,305
We've got material terms on
paper from the Malaysians.

79
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:32,675
And Mr. Ritesh Sidhwani ,
President of Indias Telecom ...

80
00:08:32,771 --> 00:08:35,887
Will be meeting us ...
I don't know, I'd say about...

81
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,779
thirty-six hours?

82
00:08:38,813 --> 00:08:41,594
Ritesh Sidhwani is coming to the resort?
Uh..huh, Uh..huh

83
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:46,676
And will stay as long as
Tom doesn't do that bloody impression, right?

84
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:55,019
I want first right of refusal on
any additional rounds of funding.

85
00:08:55,115 --> 00:08:57,129
I'm in this for the long haul.

86
00:09:00,102 --> 00:09:01,732
Not to make a fast buck.

87
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:08,157
Are you serious?

88
00:09:08,361 --> 00:09:10,434
If you consider me a friend, take it.

89
00:09:11,514 --> 00:09:14,774
We'll talk about a number that works for you
when we get back home.

90
00:09:16,596 --> 00:09:17,490
Mazel tov, boys!

91
00:09:19,282 --> 00:09:22,158
Mazel tov.

92
00:09:22,254 --> 00:09:24,364
You only live once.

93
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,994
Nice One.

94
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:30,885
Woo Hoo,Crazy!!

95
00:10:30,725 --> 00:10:35,961
Anna, the last three years
have taken everything out of me.
As you know.

96
00:10:36,397 --> 00:10:40,411
You're amazing, there
by my side the entire time.

97
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,616
I could never have done it without you.

98
00:10:44,822 --> 00:10:46,707
And I want you to know

99
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,912
that the only reason
I didn't do this earlier ...

100
00:10:48,946 --> 00:10:54,316
was because I knew you wanted
a strong enough foundation.

101
00:10:54,412 --> 00:10:56,234
So ...

102
00:11:12,153 --> 00:11:15,413
Does this open another box?

103
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:18,770
More like a door.

104
00:11:18,866 --> 00:11:20,688
Move in with me.

105
00:11:59,531 --> 00:12:00,625
<i>Guys </i>

106
00:12:01,715 --> 00:12:02,883
<i>Joe!</i>

107
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:06,781
What's going on?

108
00:12:06,815 --> 00:12:08,349
Go get the others.

109
00:12:09,883 --> 00:12:11,514
Guys?

110
00:12:17,363 --> 00:12:19,377
Damn.

111
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:21,251
- Grap a rope.
- What?

112
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:23,021
right.

113
00:12:24,843 --> 00:12:26,095
Done.
I have you.

114
00:12:26,196 --> 00:12:27,096
Relax.

115
00:12:27,195 --> 00:12:28,095
My God!

116
00:12:28,258 --> 00:12:31,863
Take the float!!
Tom, Behind you!!

117
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,435
My God! Guys, calm down we'll help!
you,calm down!

118
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:39,305
- Hold him.
- Calm down, let us help!

119
00:12:39,828 --> 00:12:40,817
- No!
- Just Breathe!

120
00:12:44,242 --> 00:12:45,196
My God!

121
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,688
- Can you give him something to calm him down?
- Give me a sedative.

122
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:50,103
- Okay, calm down.
- Where are you?

123
00:12:50,525 --> 00:12:51,425
Hurry up!

124
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,488
- Relax.
- Done.

125
00:12:56,394 --> 00:12:58,662
Why was he saying to turn the boat
around?

126
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,093
I don't have a clue.
It was crazy.

127
00:13:01,188 --> 00:13:03,169
He sounded like he had been attacked
by someone.

128
00:13:03,202 --> 00:13:06,271
I doubt it. He must have drunk
too much and fell overboard.

129
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:09,819
<i>be advised that your boarder may be an illegal.
Is he secure. Over</i>

130
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:11,354
Yes, over.

131
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,559
<i>Copy that. We'll send a
dispatch, over,</i>

132
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,669
What is the eta? over.

133
00:13:15,765 --> 00:13:20,176
<i>approximately 0900 hours;,
Give us your position, change,</i>

134
00:13:20,272 --> 00:13:21,609
Approximately ...

135
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:25,037
- What the hell are you doing?
- We're not waiting for them.

136
00:13:25,067 --> 00:13:28,965
- What do you mean we're not waiting for them?
- Joe, hear me out.

137
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:30,842
Are you out of your damn mind?
There is no way in hell that

138
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,173
I'm moving this boat
with a half dead guy in there.

139
00:13:33,181 --> 00:13:34,273
I'm not going to jail for this.

140
00:13:34,369 --> 00:13:37,150
First of all, nobody is going
to go to jail for anything.

141
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:39,931
We'll hand him over to the authorities
as soon as we get back to the resort.

142
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,295
Otherwise, we waste an entire night
waiting for them ...

143
00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:45,110
not to mention their red tape.
And trust me ...

144
00:13:45,205 --> 00:13:47,507
we don't want to keep Mr.
India Telecom waiting.

145
00:13:47,603 --> 00:13:50,096
He's right mate.
We're better off pushing on.

146
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:54,220
How is he?

147
00:13:54,316 --> 00:13:56,905
Vital signs are ok, but
he's dehydrated and losing blood.

148
00:13:57,001 --> 00:14:00,637
- he really does need to get to a hospital.
- Exactly, that's why we're going to push on.

149
00:14:00,671 --> 00:14:04,289
- What happens with the coast guard?
- We're not going to wait for them.

150
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,837
Tom, the sedatives not going to last
forever and this guy could be trouble.

151
00:14:10,978 --> 00:14:11,926
Got a lock box?

152
00:14:13,506 --> 00:14:14,454
Down there.

153
00:14:20,388 --> 00:14:21,370
Heavy breathing.

154
00:14:23,076 --> 00:14:23,938
Well

155
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:28,257
- Is it loaded?
- Yes

156
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,607
Collision warning

157
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:08,692
What?

158
00:17:17,527 --> 00:17:20,049
- Listen.
- What's going on?

159
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:23,118
I don't know.

160
00:17:33,275 --> 00:17:34,170
No!
What's happening?

161
00:17:52,098 --> 00:17:54,170
Anna! Are you okay?

162
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:55,360
Help!

163
00:17:55,649 --> 00:17:56,926
<i> Help! Help! </i>

164
00:17:57,154 --> 00:17:58,683
- Joe!
- Joe!

165
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,064
- Where are you?
- Joe!

166
00:18:00,195 --> 00:18:01,123
Help!

167
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:02,305

169
00:18:03,972 --> 00:18:04,867
<i> Joe </i>

170
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:07,038

171
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,918

It's stuck!

174
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,055
I'm fine.
Almost ...

175
00:18:28,363 --> 00:18:29,257
Thank God.

176
00:18:29,515 --> 00:18:30,498
- Come on, baby.
- Yes.

177
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,594
Anna!

178
00:18:57,108 --> 00:18:58,318
Anna! Come on!

179
00:19:01,653 --> 00:19:02,963
Gotcha!
Alright!

180
00:19:03,222 --> 00:19:04,815
Calm down, I've
Gotcha.

181
00:19:07,255 --> 00:19:08,149
Gotcha!

182
00:19:12,632 --> 00:19:14,804
Wait up baby.
Wait.

183
00:19:24,924 --> 00:19:25,819
Are you alright?

184
00:19:25,949 --> 00:19:27,225
- You Okay?
- I'm fine.

185
00:19:27,357 --> 00:19:28,502
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

186
00:19:28,605 --> 00:19:29,652
- Where are the others?
- Help!

187
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:31,228
Help!

188
00:19:31,518 --> 00:19:32,412
Tom!

189
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,198
Tom!

190
00:19:35,871 --> 00:19:36,764
Help!

191
00:19:39,456 --> 00:19:41,212
Help! Help!

192
00:19:45,858 --> 00:19:47,681
Tom! I'm stuck!
I'm stuck!

193
00:19:49,282 --> 00:19:50,331
Help!

194
00:19:50,468 --> 00:19:52,029
- I can't swim!
- Hold on!

195
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,914
Tom!

196
00:19:56,837 --> 00:19:58,497
- Wait, I've got it!
- I've got it!

197
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:01,694
Gotcha!

198
00:20:05,543 --> 00:20:06,592
My goodness!

199
00:20:07,145 --> 00:20:08,225
Oh My God.

200
00:20:10,696 --> 00:20:12,485
Chris?
Chris, are you okay?

201
00:20:13,577 --> 00:20:14,561
Joe!

202
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:16,073
Please!

203
00:20:17,227 --> 00:20:18,209
Are you okay?

204
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:20,427
- Okay?
- I'm alright. Thanks.

205
00:20:21,548 --> 00:20:22,477
Are you okay?

206
00:20:23,982 --> 00:20:24,811
Yes

207
00:20:24,811 --> 00:20:27,688
What the hell happened?

208
00:20:27,783 --> 00:20:29,510
Where is my damn boat?

209
00:20:32,674 --> 00:20:34,017
Where are we?

210
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:25,034
Joe, I found the radio!

211
00:21:28,582 --> 00:21:30,261
Did not copy, over.

212
00:21:30,294 --> 00:21:31,939
Did not copy. One more time.

213
00:21:39,035 --> 00:21:40,570
Any <i> casualties?
Over, </i>

214
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:40,666
No casualties, over.

215
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:44,022
<i> position of the transponder, over, </i>

216
00:21:44,118 --> 00:21:45,940
Transponder inoperative.

217
00:21:46,036 --> 00:21:48,913
The transponder is inoperative,
over.

218
00:21:51,694 --> 00:21:54,091
<i> Last known position,
over, </i>

219
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:01,092
Five hours north
of the Antilles.

220
00:22:01,188 --> 00:22:04,640
Approximately five hours
north of the Antilles. Do you copy?

221
00:22:04,736 --> 00:22:06,941
<i> Yes, Sending dispatch </i>

222
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:10,586
ETA?

223
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,750
ETZ, Do you read me?

224
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:18,982
Okay.

225
00:22:19,981 --> 00:22:21,095
We'll be fine.

226
00:22:24,395 --> 00:22:26,217
They will be here.

227
00:22:30,532 --> 00:22:33,026
He must have drowned
when the boat hit.

228
00:22:34,368 --> 00:22:37,053
That's strange.

229
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:39,547
He may have started running
when we reached the shore.

230
00:22:39,643 --> 00:22:41,896
Do you want me to keep looking?

231
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:47,123
No. Let's gather what's left
and build a shelter.

232
00:22:47,218 --> 00:22:49,870
Hey, Hey.

233
00:22:49,904 --> 00:22:52,013
How did this happen?
It doesn't make any sense?

234
00:22:52,047 --> 00:22:53,931
I thought you were standing watch.

235
00:22:54,027 --> 00:22:56,904
I was. I don't know.
It could have been the autopilot.

236
00:22:56,938 --> 00:22:59,973
I don't think so.
That auto pilot was state of the art.

237
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:02,562
Yeah, but those things
conk out all the time.

238
00:23:02,658 --> 00:23:04,159
Conk out?

239
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,918
Yeah.

240
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,658
Storms or solar flares
they disrupt the satellite link up.

241
00:23:09,754 --> 00:23:12,056
They go off the air.

242
00:23:12,152 --> 00:23:16,275
Look, for all I know it could have been
stuck in the death stars tractor beam.

243
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:19,152
As long as the insurance company
buys it, I'm fine.

244
00:23:19,248 --> 00:23:20,687
It'll be fine.
Trust me.

245
00:23:20,783 --> 00:23:23,146
It's all good.

246
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:27,687
This is why the Dalai Lama says
to practice detachment.

247
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:32,290
So your not bound by the
shackles of material possessions.

248
00:23:35,071 --> 00:23:37,034
It means we need to
learn to let go.

249
00:23:37,044 --> 00:23:38,140
Yes

250
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,976
Hey Honey? I think the universe
trying to tell me something.

251
00:23:44,086 --> 00:23:47,826
Hey Sherlock, the wood needs
be drier than that.

252
00:23:47,922 --> 00:23:50,894
Sherlock?
We did that at school.

253
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:54,876
What does that mean then?
Watson is that you?

254
00:23:54,918 --> 00:23:56,711
He doesn't have to call me
Sherlock.

255
00:23:57,687 --> 00:23:59,194
Must have their reasons.

256
00:23:59,573 --> 00:24:03,457
Perhaps you should have been keeping
watch instead of making stupid jokes.

257
00:24:03,553 --> 00:24:06,813
And then we wouldn't be stuck at the
end of this world.

258
00:24:07,149 --> 00:24:09,203
What do you think I am?

259
00:24:09,211 --> 00:24:11,033
A puppet?

260
00:24:25,513 --> 00:24:26,664
Hello?

261
00:24:47,858 --> 00:24:49,871
Is he?

262
00:24:49,967 --> 00:24:51,025
I think so.

263
00:24:51,035 --> 00:24:54,283
You see?
I told you he had drowned.

264
00:24:54,379 --> 00:24:55,605
Yeah, but ...

265
00:24:55,879 --> 00:24:57,064
How did his body get here?

266
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,749
Now that we have identified the body,
can we go please?

267
00:24:59,845 --> 00:25:01,571
We can't just leave him like this.

268
00:25:01,571 --> 00:25:05,277
The smells going to get a lot worse as it rots.

269
00:25:05,311 --> 00:25:09,435
And it won't be long till something comes by
looking for a free meal.

270
00:25:41,177 --> 00:25:44,821
There is a dog running around here,
there's gotta be someone here.

271
00:25:44,917 --> 00:25:46,136
Besides ...

272
00:25:46,242 --> 00:25:49,130
We've gotta start thinking
about food and water.

273
00:25:49,232 --> 00:25:51,629
But shouldn't we stick together
now, Tom?

274
00:25:51,725 --> 00:25:53,931
No, someone needs to go.

275
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,781
If anything happens ...

276
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:08,149
Oh Wow.

277
00:27:12,855 --> 00:27:14,197
Hello?

278
00:27:17,937 --> 00:27:19,472
Hello?

279
00:27:21,677 --> 00:27:23,403
What is this place?

280
00:27:23,499 --> 00:27:27,048
It looks like some kind of
military site.

281
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:30,788
It works.

282
00:27:33,473 --> 00:27:34,686
Damn!

283
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:37,213
My God. Gansus.

284
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:40,090
- What?
- Gansus research.

285
00:27:40,665 --> 00:27:44,693
They sponsored my research project
last year on dna coding.

286
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:47,953
- At NYU?
- Yeah.

287
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:53,611
They're very well funded
by anthropologists.

288
00:27:55,529 --> 00:27:57,255
And very well armed.

289
00:27:58,406 --> 00:28:00,228
Give me.

290
00:28:00,324 --> 00:28:02,721
Hopefully it works.

291
00:28:05,694 --> 00:28:07,325
Works pretty good.

292
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,434
Yeah, it's trying to
find a signal.

293
00:28:14,421 --> 00:28:16,147
There ...

294
00:28:18,257 --> 00:28:20,079
I found it!

295
00:28:20,414 --> 00:28:23,197
FIND THE REMAINING TEAM
AND TERMINATE

296
00:28:32,258 --> 00:28:33,888
What's going on?

297
00:28:40,889 --> 00:28:42,615
Guys?

298
00:28:53,451 --> 00:28:56,424
It makes no sense.
Why did they leave all of this here?

299
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,054
They must be coming back.

300
00:29:18,193 --> 00:29:20,398
Guys? Hello!

301
00:29:20,494 --> 00:29:22,988
Joe! Alexis!

302
00:29:37,852 --> 00:29:39,098
Here.

303
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,016
Jesus, man.

304
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,838
Look.

305
00:29:42,934 --> 00:29:46,674
- What?
- Look.

306
00:29:56,264 --> 00:29:59,621
Hey doesn't our guy
wear this?

307
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:02,977
Yeah
He was here.

308
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,772
Let's go!

309
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:19,855
Hey Chris! Joe!

310
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:21,965
Tom! Over Here!

311
00:30:31,459 --> 00:30:32,897
What happened?

312
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:35,007
I don't know.

313
00:30:35,103 --> 00:30:37,980
We found it like this.

314
00:30:43,062 --> 00:30:45,939
Mayday! Mayday!
Does anybody read me? copy.

315
00:30:49,008 --> 00:30:53,035
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
Does anybody read me? copy.

316
00:30:53,069 --> 00:30:54,858
When are they supposed to be here?

317
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:56,584
I don't know, Joe.

318
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,557
You heard them.
They lost the transmission.

319
00:30:59,652 --> 00:31:02,817
Somebody or something
took that guy ...

320
00:31:02,913 --> 00:31:05,406
and you want us to just sit around here and
doing nothing?

321
00:31:05,502 --> 00:31:07,996
Please trust me.
We're gonna be ok.

322
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:09,321
OK?

323
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:12,503
Ok like your dead friend over there?

324
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:14,038
Oh yeah.

325
00:31:14,043 --> 00:31:17,106
We could go see him,
but somehow he's gone!

326
00:31:17,202 --> 00:31:18,482
Oh hey let's all go to my boat.

327
00:31:18,742 --> 00:31:19,952
We can't.
Why?

328
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:23,819
Because it's gone!

329
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:27,750
But for our leader,
everything is ok.

330
00:31:27,846 --> 00:31:30,915
Joe, I do not recall asking
to be your leader.

331
00:31:31,011 --> 00:31:32,387
Not his fault, okay, Joe?

332
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:34,045
The guy went through the port hole
and crashed the boat.

333
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:38,011
- Anna!
- None of us could know that.

334
00:31:38,045 --> 00:31:40,521
- That guy crashed my boat?
- Is she serious?

335
00:31:40,555 --> 00:31:42,998
We don't know
if that's what happened.

336
00:31:43,094 --> 00:31:44,724
She's laughing?

337
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,601
After that foolishness
solar flares and satellite links.

338
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:50,064
- After I take my chances with you?
- Stop!

339
00:31:50,095 --> 00:31:52,492
What?

340
00:31:58,054 --> 00:32:00,451
Tom!

341
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:04,575
I was trying to save time.

342
00:32:04,671 --> 00:32:06,877
Fat lot of good that did.

343
00:32:06,973 --> 00:32:09,466
I didn't know this was going to happen.

344
00:32:09,562 --> 00:32:11,288
Don't go?
Look, we all understand.

345
00:32:11,384 --> 00:32:13,110
We understand.
Lying is ok!

346
00:32:13,206 --> 00:32:15,221
- Tom?
- Anna, please.

347
00:32:15,456 --> 00:32:17,905
I just need some space.

348
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,963
Hello?

349
00:33:12,183 --> 00:33:14,293
Hello?

350
00:33:22,444 --> 00:33:24,554
Hello?

351
00:34:19,311 --> 00:34:21,996
Tom?

352
00:34:42,902 --> 00:34:43,957
Tom!

353
00:34:48,368 --> 00:34:49,807
Why would he have gone in there?

354
00:34:49,902 --> 00:34:51,533
He must have went back to the camp.

355
00:34:51,566 --> 00:34:53,355
What? Why?

356
00:34:53,451 --> 00:34:57,191
The equipment was still there.
He must have thought they would come back.

357
00:34:57,224 --> 00:34:59,588
I don't ... I'm going.

358
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:04,767
Okay, let's go.

359
00:35:04,862 --> 00:35:07,452
Now hold on a minute. Shouldn't
We wait here for him?

360
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:10,041
I mean the Coast Guard could
be here at any time.

361
00:35:10,137 --> 00:35:11,959
Fine. Wait, if you want.

362
00:35:13,877 --> 00:35:15,987
The jungle is a living breathing organism.

363
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:20,014
And you just breathe it in and it'll be ok.

364
00:35:36,317 --> 00:35:38,235
Oh My God.

365
00:35:38,331 --> 00:35:41,016
Tom?

366
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:46,386
Hello?

367
00:35:46,482 --> 00:35:48,879
Tom!

368
00:35:50,797 --> 00:35:54,250
So it was all like here, right Anna?

369
00:35:54,346 --> 00:35:59,045
Everything, all the gear, everything
was here.

370
00:35:59,141 --> 00:36:01,058
Boy, they didn't waste any time did they?

371
00:36:01,154 --> 00:36:03,072
Where did they go?

372
00:36:03,168 --> 00:36:07,196
The text message said to find
the remaining team and end the mission.

373
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:09,447
They must have come back and left.

374
00:36:10,091 --> 00:36:12,374
And he's out there,
looking for them somewhere.

375
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,546
Yes, but how the hell can we find them?

376
00:36:13,618 --> 00:36:16,114
That's like looking for Noel Gallagher
at Old Trafford, isn't it?

377
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:17,144
Hey Guys?

378
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,318
Over here.

379
00:36:19,663 --> 00:36:21,389
What is it?

380
00:36:25,608 --> 00:36:28,006
Looks like they might have gone through here.

381
00:36:39,226 --> 00:36:42,678
If that guy was here, he
must have been in some kind of trouble.

382
00:36:42,774 --> 00:36:44,788
We're gonna find out, aren't we?

383
00:36:44,884 --> 00:36:46,610
Guys?

384
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,928
Oh my gosh.

385
00:37:26,024 --> 00:37:27,411
Lovely.

386
00:37:27,501 --> 00:37:29,380
What else we gonna find?

387
00:37:44,628 --> 00:37:45,874
Chris?

388
00:37:56,711 --> 00:37:58,149
There's something up there.

389
00:38:02,273 --> 00:38:04,287
It's probably just the wind.

390
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:06,397
Guys, what's going on?

391
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:09,178
Everything Okay?

392
00:38:09,211 --> 00:38:11,479
Yes

393
00:38:11,575 --> 00:38:16,082
- Yes, fine.
- Can we go now?

394
00:38:16,178 --> 00:38:18,480
Oh good.

395
00:39:08,442 --> 00:39:09,785
Who is it?

396
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:12,470
Jesus Christ! He's here.

397
00:39:12,566 --> 00:39:15,731
Oh My God!

398
00:39:15,826 --> 00:39:18,032
What the hell kind of animal did that?

399
00:39:18,128 --> 00:39:20,909
The sternums been split open.
No animal did that.

400
00:39:24,169 --> 00:39:26,663
What's happening?

401
00:39:30,019 --> 00:39:32,513
Oh My God.

402
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:36,723
What is that?

403
00:39:37,595 --> 00:39:39,513
There is something up there!

404
00:39:46,993 --> 00:39:49,678
I've had enough of this. I'm going
back to the beach.

405
00:39:49,774 --> 00:39:51,500
You can't just leave, Chris.

406
00:39:51,596 --> 00:39:52,820
You see that?

407
00:39:53,046 --> 00:39:55,945
That's not normal! You said so yourself!

408
00:39:55,945 --> 00:39:58,789
I'm going back to the beach to wait
for the coast guard.

409
00:39:58,884 --> 00:40:01,857
like any normal human being,
rather than running around

410
00:40:01,953 --> 00:40:04,159
playing George of the bloody jungle!

411
00:40:04,255 --> 00:40:06,269
Ok he is right. We need to go back.

412
00:40:06,364 --> 00:40:08,954
What if they don't show up?

413
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:11,255
And what if Tom is in trouble out there?

414
00:40:11,351 --> 00:40:14,036
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

415
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,379
I'm sorry, but I'm going back. We don't
know what's going on!

416
00:40:22,475 --> 00:40:25,160
You are unbelievable.

417
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:28,613
All this being a warrior goddess at one
with the universe bullshit ...

418
00:40:28,646 --> 00:40:32,161
goes flying out the window
once the shit flies?

419
00:40:32,257 --> 00:40:34,558
You're pathetic!

420
00:40:34,654 --> 00:40:37,148
Let's go.

421
00:40:44,436 --> 00:40:46,641
<i> Tom </i>

422
00:40:49,998 --> 00:40:51,025
Hello?

423
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:53,546
Is anyone there? Hello

424
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:02,081
We need to catch that dog.

425
00:41:17,712 --> 00:41:19,726
Tom?

426
00:41:26,439 --> 00:41:28,261
Tom?

427
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,235
Chris, wait up.

428
00:41:48,112 --> 00:41:49,550
Chris, wait up.

429
00:41:49,646 --> 00:41:52,811
What happened to that yoga of yours love?

430
00:41:52,907 --> 00:41:55,592
Maybe we should head back.

431
00:41:55,688 --> 00:41:58,373
I'll tell you what.
I didn't ask to come along.

432
00:41:58,469 --> 00:42:01,633
If you want to go back, jog on.

433
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:04,031
Unbelievable.

434
00:42:48,623 --> 00:42:50,349
Damn!

435
00:42:53,802 --> 00:42:56,487
It's all been erased.

436
00:42:56,583 --> 00:42:57,925
I saw something.

437
00:43:01,953 --> 00:43:05,117
There may be something here.

438
00:43:11,734 --> 00:43:13,077
Yeah

439
00:43:14,707 --> 00:43:16,625
Kansas is canceling <i>
funding, </i>

440
00:43:19,023 --> 00:43:21,280
<i> it makes no sense, given that
in the last three days ,,,</i>

441
00:43:21,347 --> 00:43:25,640

than we have in 300 years, </i>

442
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,516
<i> The rest of the team decided to leave
but I couldn't </i>

443
00:43:28,612 --> 00:43:30,434
I told him that I needed <i>
another week ,,,</i>

444
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:31,929
<i> to finish up the
field reports ,,,</i>

445
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,154

uncovered so far, </i>

446
00:43:34,174 --> 00:43:36,668
<i> They agreed , </i>

447
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,408
<i> And then it happened, </i>

448
00:43:40,504 --> 00:43:44,723
We found something! We found something!

449
00:43:44,819 --> 00:43:47,504
<i> There was no doubt in my
mind that this was it,,,</i>

450
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:52,395
<i> the answer to a question that man
had been searching for since the beginning of time ,,,</i>

451
00:43:52,491 --> 00:43:54,888
<i> the missing link in our evolution, </i>

452
00:43:54,984 --> 00:43:57,286
<i> The cranium was much larger
than I expected ,,,</i>

453
00:43:57,319 --> 00:44:02,081
<i> and the eye sockets were small,
indicating a limited field of vision, </i>

454
00:44:02,177 --> 00:44:05,053
<i> it conclusively proved that,
as a species, we evolved, </i>

455
00:44:05,149 --> 00:44:08,314
<i> And Moreover, our evolution was not
through a gradual progression ,,,</i>

456
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:10,343
<i> from simian to Homo sapiens ,,,</i>

457
00:44:10,365 --> 00:44:12,605
<i> but that a genetic mutation

462

00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:37,946

00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:40,536

465
00:44:40,569 --> 00:44:43,796
<i> I couldn't risk this

466
00:44:45,297 --> 00:44:46,409
ELO RECOVERED
WAITING FOR INSTRUCTIONS

467
00:44:52,331 --> 00:44:53,610
If the church were to find out <i> ,,,</i>

468
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,048
HOLY BIBLE

469
00:44:55,496 --> 00:44:58,277
I wouldn't live to <i>
tell this discovery, </i>

470
00:44:58,376 --> 00:44:59,585
NEW KING JAMES VERSION

VALUE $ 50 MILLION
ACCOUNT 54119571814

472
00:45:00,479 --> 00:45:01,427
NATIONAL BANK OF ZURICH

473
00:45:02,112 --> 00:45:03,935
<i> They were the only ones </i>

474
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:06,332
<i>interested in stopping the world
from knowing ,,,</i>

475
00:45:06,428 --> 00:45:09,688
<i> that God did not create
man on the sixth day, </i>

476
00:45:11,031 --> 00:45:14,100
Anyone who knows about this is dead.

477
00:45:16,209 --> 00:45:18,703
They will stop at nothing
to protect this.

478
00:45:20,813 --> 00:45:21,706
Oh God.

479
00:45:22,731 --> 00:45:23,677
Tom!

480
00:45:23,944 --> 00:45:24,836
- And what if he ...
- Anna, no.

481
00:45:24,902 --> 00:45:26,785
- We know nothing, Anna.
- We need to find him.

482
00:45:26,851 --> 00:45:27,743
We have to.

483
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:53,897
Joe?

484
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:56,870
Joe?

485
00:45:56,966 --> 00:45:59,651
Hey

486
00:45:59,749 --> 00:46:00,775
- I don't know.
- My God.

487
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:04,062
There's nothing. I think that
the dog got spooked out.

488
00:46:40,024 --> 00:46:42,421
Don't move.

489
00:46:42,455 --> 00:46:44,819
Get up!

490
00:46:44,915 --> 00:46:48,751
I'm only going to ask you this
once. Where are the others?

491
00:46:48,784 --> 00:46:49,805
What others?

492
00:46:49,901 --> 00:46:51,340
The rest of your team.

493
00:46:51,436 --> 00:46:53,354
I don't know what you're talking about.

494
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:56,039
Our boat crashed and we've been
waiting for the Coast Guard.

495
00:47:00,162 --> 00:47:03,231
Do you want last rites?

496
00:50:48,015 --> 00:50:51,947
Mayday! Mayday! Please help me!

497
01:01:07,034 --> 01:01:08,568
Tom?

498
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:09,623
Tom!

499
01:01:09,719 --> 01:01:12,404
Oh My God, please don't die, I
found him. I found him.

500
01:01:14,419 --> 01:01:19,884
Shhhh You're ok. Your gonna be ok now.

501
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,514
I'm here.

502
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:23,145
Anna?

503
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,254
Yes. It's me, baby.

504
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:29,066
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm ok.

505
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:31,775
- But we have to go now.
- I can't.

506
01:01:31,871 --> 01:01:33,981
Baby, we have to go.

507
01:01:34,077 --> 01:01:36,570
I can't make it Anna.

508
01:01:36,604 --> 01:01:38,392
- Go, save yourself.
- No. No, Tom!

509
01:01:38,488 --> 01:01:41,365
- I can't leave. I can't.
- Tom, no! No!

510
01:01:41,461 --> 01:01:43,475
Kill me, please kill me Anna!

511
01:01:43,571 --> 01:01:45,680
No! No!

512
01:01:45,776 --> 01:01:48,270
I can't leave you, baby. I can't.

513
01:01:48,366 --> 01:01:49,996
Kill me! Please!

514
01:01:50,092 --> 01:01:51,147
We must go now.

515
01:01:51,243 --> 01:01:52,777
Kill me, please!

516
01:01:59,873 --> 01:02:01,813
Honey, that's fine. It's
not that bad.

517
01:02:02,846 --> 01:02:04,179
Listen to me.

518
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:06,490
Save yourself.

519
01:02:06,586 --> 01:02:10,038
I will do anything, baby.
But please don't go.

520
01:02:10,134 --> 01:02:13,395
Please don't go.
Just please don't go baby.

521
01:02:15,792 --> 01:02:16,867
Anna ...

522
01:02:17,411 --> 01:02:18,972
my pocket.

523
01:02:19,811 --> 01:02:21,055
My pocket.

524
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:23,071
My left pocket.

525
01:02:44,082 --> 01:02:45,329
Sorry, Anna.

526
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:50,124
I'm so sorry.

527
01:03:00,957 --> 01:03:03,166
Be strong.

528
01:03:06,808 --> 01:03:08,440
Be strong.

529
01:03:08,536 --> 01:03:10,166
I love you.

530
01:03:20,523 --> 01:03:23,675
I love you, Anna.

531
01:03:24,071 --> 01:03:26,242
I will always love you, Anna.
