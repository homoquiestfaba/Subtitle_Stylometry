1
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:18,353
<i>MAN:
911, what's your emergency?</i>

2
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:21,022
WOMAN:
911? Thank God!

3
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:22,982
My friend went swimming
in Sandy Beach!

4
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:23,858
<i>Oh, ok ma'am.</i>

5
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:25,151
And he, he's gone!

6
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,443
<i>When did you last
see your friend?</i>

7
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:27,486
I can't find him!

8
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:28,279
<i>When did you last
see your friend?</i>

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,989
I don't know, a half hour!

10
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:33,409
<i>Ok, ok, ma'am, I need
you to calm down,</i>

11
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:34,827
<i>we have someone on the way.</i>

12
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:36,203
Hurry please!

13
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:39,582
<i>I need you to calm down,
stay put, stay where you're at.</i>

14
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:12,823
MAN: ...moved spiritually
to his Kingdom,

15
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:18,079
where they will
become one with others.

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,541
And their soul may
grow for Eternity.

17
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:26,337
For the Lord himself shall
descend from Heaven

18
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:31,342
with a shout, with the voice
of the Arc Angel.

19
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:36,764
With the trump of God and the
dead of Christ will rise first,

20
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:42,269
then which we are alive
and shall remain the same,

21
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:47,858
be caught up together with
them in the clouds, to meet

22
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:55,741
the Lord in the air and so we
shall be ever with the Lord.

23
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:59,495
James has moved on in spirit,
but shall be remembered...

24
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:02,331
Glad you could make it.

25
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:04,750
Man, I was just
with him last week.

26
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:13,884
PRIEST...as we too await our
calling to the Holy Land, Amen.

27
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:02,785
Shit!

28
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,371
I warned you, dude,
Filipino pussy.

29
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,872
She wasn't
Filipino, man.

30
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,124
Filipino, Malaysian,
whatever, the point is,

31
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,668
you've got to double up
on the raincoats, bro.

32
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,002
Yeah?

33
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,921
Yeah, hey listen, there are
some nasty organisms out there,

34
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:16,632
alright, E coli, swine flu.

35
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:17,800
I hooked up with
a Thai chick from --

36
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:18,550
Highland Park?

37
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:19,426
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,220
How old was she
again, 12?

39
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:22,596
She looked it...

40
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:24,265
after she shaved.

41
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,599
That's cute, man,
that's real cute.

42
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:26,725
I know.

43
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,270
You, my friend, are
a sick fucking asshole.

44
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,354
You think?

45
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:31,272
Mm-hmm.

46
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,859
It's so hard out there,
you have no idea.

47
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,861
Guys will post their pictures
online and you're like,

48
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,030
oh hey, he's cute,
maybe I'll get past

49
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,825
the "let's grab
a mochaccino" stage.

50
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:48,455
Yeah right, you meet the guy
and he's a freaking caveman.

51
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,668
I don't know what happened,
I used to be so fuckable

52
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,128
in high school.

53
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:59,258
Jessie, really?

54
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,135
I just have this sick
feeling that something

55
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,846
awful is going to happen.

56
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:07,808
Come here,
don't say that.

57
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,102
It's going to be ok.

58
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:15,024
It's just, first,
my fiance cheats on me

59
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,901
and I have to call off
my wedding...

60
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,529
and now Jimmy.

61
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,948
I know, I know.

62
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,366
Come on.

63
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,505
So how's your love
life, Courtney?

64
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,507
Fantastic, Ryan,
how's yours?

65
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:41,925
No complaints here.

66
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,345
I'm surprised your dick
hasn't fallen off by now.

67
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:53,437
Um...it's great to
see everybody again.

68
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:59,818
I just wish the situation
was a little different.

69
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,989
I think it's important
that we remember Jimmy

70
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,201
and the good times that we had.

71
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:10,120
So with that, uh, I would
like to propose a toast.

72
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:12,664
What the fuck is a toast
gonna do, bring him back?

73
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,333
You know what,
shut the fuck up, Nathan!

74
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,168
Why do you have to be so
depressing all the time?

75
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,045
Don't you think it's depressing
romanticizing a guy

76
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:19,963
that was stupid enough
to get himself killed

77
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,799
because he was in deep
with some drug dealers?

78
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,925
Or whatever
happed to him.

79
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,177
Don't you have any
fucking feelings, Nathan?

80
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:34,478
Such an asshole.

81
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:41,151
Like I was about to say...
To Jimmy, he was a great friend,

82
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:45,197
and the funniest guy
I've ever met.

83
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:50,202
No matter how down you were,
or no matter how down he was,

84
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:53,789
he was always good for a laugh.

85
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:54,456
Here here.

86
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:55,416
Cheers.

87
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:05,843
Do you guys remember when
he rearranged the reindeer

88
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,220
on Mrs. Heller's lawn,
so on Christmas Day

89
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:09,805
they were all
humping each other?

90
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:11,390
Christmas morning,
right?

91
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:12,641
Classic, man.

92
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:15,853
Or the time that
he jelloed the pool?

93
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,813
Or the time that he faked
putting pot into all

94
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,691
the cafeteria cupcakes and the
entire school was dismissed

95
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,443
because everyone thought
they were high?

96
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:24,445
Oh my God.

97
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:28,490
Remember Donald Buckley?

98
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,617
Oh my God...

99
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,090
<i>It's on, go!</i>

100
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,009
Hi Donald!

101
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,178
Congratulations on
being Valedictorian.

102
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,638
Blow any football
players this weekend?

103
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,015
That's funny, Donald.

104
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,058
Actually, I am doing an
interview for the school paper

105
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,351
and I was wondering if
you wanted to answer

106
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,144
a couple questions for us.

107
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:58,812
No.

108
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,401
Hey, it's on!

109
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,279
It's On!

110
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,866
One shot dude,
one shot right here.

111
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:12,326
There he is,
there he is.

112
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,086
Yes!

113
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,630
Fuck you, Buckley!

114
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,341
There goes your
scholarship, buddy!

115
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:32,012
So what did Jimmy have
against Donald Buckley?

116
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:34,264
Hmm...He asked Beth
out on a date.

117
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:35,140
Buckley?

118
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:35,974
What?

119
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,226
Oh my God.

120
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,602
I mean, I don't understand,
why did everyone wanna

121
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,479
ask out Beth
in high school?

122
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,481
She's cute, ok.

123
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:45,067
She was more than cute.

124
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:48,111
She had that, uh,
that velvet tongue.

125
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:51,031
I'm getting tight in the pants
just thinking about her.

126
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:54,243
Beth was always
there for you.

127
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,039
You do anything?

128
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:01,166
You had a thing for
Beth, huh, Nathan?

129
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,459
Oh, you're
blushing, dude.

130
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:09,258
Beth was Jimmy's girlfriend.

131
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,813
Yeah, alright, guys.

132
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,481
Who's the asshole, huh?

133
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,733
What? No, not me.

134
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,610
Seriously guys,
come on, pizza?

135
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:30,153
I mean, that's really
fucking high school.

136
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,281
Maybe a little bit of
imagination next time?

137
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,241
There's five
boxes, Ryan.

138
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,455
One for each of us.

139
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:53,510
Yo, Pedro, where...where'd
the pizzas come from, huh?

140
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,679
No? You don't speak English?

141
00:09:55,721 --> 00:10:00,934
Not a fucking thing, huh?

142
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:02,561
Fuck man!

143
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:38,221
Help!

144
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:48,565
Help! Help!

145
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,911
Help!

146
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:29,392
<i>Hey Beth, it's Ron from
work, uh, where are ya?</i>

147
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:31,478
<i>Beth, it's Ron.</i>

148
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,566
<i>Two days in a row,
I hope everything's ok.</i>

149
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,360
<i>Call the office.</i>

150
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,863
<i>Hey Beth, I don't
know what to say...</i>

151
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:47,202
<i>sorry this isn't working out,
um, there's no need to come in,</i>

152
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,370
<i>we'll mail you a check.</i>

153
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:52,040
<i>Ok, good luck.</i>

154
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:57,921
<i>Beth, I, uh, I hope this
is you, it's me, Jessie,</i>

155
00:13:57,963 --> 00:14:01,007
Jessie <i>Anderson
from Grace Arbor.</i>

156
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:05,887
<i>Beth, I, I have some
bad news about Jimmy.</i>

157
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,454
Look, I'm sorry, ok?

158
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:32,956
I didn't want to
scare the girls.

159
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:35,542
Bullshit, you didn't
want to scare the girls!

160
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:36,918
Why didn't you tell me?

161
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,920
It's confidential,
Ryan, ok?

162
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:43,091
If word got out that Jimmy
was barbequed like a brisket,

163
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,802
the whole town would go crazy.

164
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:49,973
I mean, there is a sick fuck
out there, dude.

165
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,853
Somebody stole my phone.

166
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,271
What?

167
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:59,691
Look, I'm not sure
what happened, alright.

168
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,234
Maybe you misplaced it.

169
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:02,444
Did you check your car
or something?

170
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,779
No, that fucking thing
is tethered to me, man.

171
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,873
I called the pizza parlor.

172
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:20,462
Somebody called in those pizzas
under my name, using my phone.

173
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,144
Look, you gotta start telling
me everything, ok Blake?

174
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:36,645
Ok!

175
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:37,228
I mean it!

176
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,188
Alright!

177
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,481
No more of this
police bullshit.

178
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,653
Hey Blake?

179
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:49,199
Somebody's fucking
with our heads, man.

180
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,159
Talk to Nathan?

181
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,453
No, fuck Nathan!

182
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:55,497
Fucking faggot.

183
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:47,901
Who moved my fucking car?

184
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:38,409
You're fucking kidding me.

185
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:58,680
Someone racked up a thousand
dollars in porn sites

186
00:18:58,721 --> 00:18:59,889
on my credit card.

187
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,432
Somebody moved my car
to another parking spot.

188
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,601
Someone ordered a guy
prostitute to my house.

189
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,980
I got this in the mail today.

190
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,815
Dipshit, why didn't you
tell me you had my phone?

191
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:11,693
I had to see if we
were involved, man!

192
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,153
We're being targeted, Ryan!

193
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:14,237
Shit.

194
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,238
Do you know what's
happening right now?

195
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,781
What do you mean
we're being targeted?

196
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,908
Jimmy wasn't killed because
of a bad gambling debt

197
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,703
and Blake knows it.

198
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:24,372
Jimmy was killed on
the same day as Brandon Booth.

199
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:25,707
You guys remember him?

200
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,209
Three years to the exact
same day, June 5th...

201
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:30,712
Someone knows what
happened at Sandy Beach.

202
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:31,963
Someone knows we were involved.

203
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,382
No, no, that's impossible,
nobody else was there.

204
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:35,091
It's Beth.

205
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:35,925
It wasn't Beth.

206
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,093
It's Beth,
she was there!

207
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:38,636
Beth was out of town,
she would've had to have

208
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:39,929
done everything herself.

209
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:41,014
Ok, maybe she
has someone.

210
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,849
Beth hated pranks,
it wasn't her!

211
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:45,059
Guys!

212
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:48,271
Blake, what's going on?

213
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,152
The police think that it was
somebody from high school

214
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,403
who killed Jimmy.

215
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:56,529
Who? Why?

216
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:57,906
I don't know...

217
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,699
Jimmy did a lot of messed up
things to a lot of people.

218
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:03,161
So the police don't know about
Sandy Beach then, do they, hmm?

219
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,662
No.

220
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,414
Lucky for us, America's finest
can't put two and two together.

221
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:07,665
Nice.

222
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,667
We didn't do anything,
Sandy Beach was Jimmy's fault.

223
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,170
No, we obstructed an
investigation, Courtney.

224
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:12,754
Do you remember that?

225
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:13,922
We lied.

226
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,256
That makes us all
accomplices to murder here.

227
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:16,716
Manslaughter.

228
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,259
Whoa, you guys, I think we're
jumping the gun here, ok listen,

229
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:21,054
there's nothing that links
Jimmy to Brandon at all.

230
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,972
Of course they were
related dumb fuck!

231
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:24,599
They were killed
on the same day.

232
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:27,060
Guys, guys,
what if he's watching us?

233
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,354
What if this person
is watching us?

234
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,855
I can't handle this.

235
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,690
What if whoever killed Jimmy is
going to try and kill us, too?

236
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,441
Stop it.

237
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:34,067
I'm going to be sick.

238
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,109
Just stop!

239
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:39,739
You ok?

240
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:42,450
So what about
you, Blake?

241
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,202
Big-shot Sheriff.

242
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:45,828
Who ordered
the fucking pizzas?

243
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,080
Fuck off, Ryan.

244
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,206
No, who ordered
the pizzas?

245
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:49,123
I said, fuck off,
get out of my face!

246
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,333
You didn't answer
my question!

247
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,209
I'm not gonna fucking
answer your question!

248
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:52,085
Who ordered
the fucking --

249
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,378
Y'all need to
chill out!

250
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:54,754
Fuck you, Nathan
get out of my way.

251
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:57,131
Guys, fighting isn't going
to help anything right now!

252
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,508
Fuck you, man, you have
no fucking clue

253
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:59,634
what you're
talking about, ok?

254
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:01,886
You're messing up
everything!

255
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,429
I'm not messing
shit up!

256
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,764
I don't know
what I'm doing!

257
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,641
I don't know who ordered
the fucking pizzas!

258
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:07,767
You're fucking it all up!

259
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:09,560
You're a fucking asshole, man.

260
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,710
Hi there.

261
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,920
I am looking for the
high school yearbooks.

262
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,422
Ah, they're in the
reference section,

263
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,215
back aisle
against the wall.

264
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:40,925
Thank you very much,
appreciate it.

265
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,313
Find 'em?

266
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:56,649
Um...2010,
it's not here.

267
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:59,110
Oh, uh, let me
check the front.

268
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:14,959
Liam Rivers?

269
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,669
Yeah.

270
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:25,428
Sorry about the mess, we go
to print in a couple hours.

271
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,097
You wrote an article
about my brother,

272
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:31,142
he died three years
ago on Sandy Beach.

273
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:35,730
Brandon Booth.

274
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:38,441
Brandon Booth?

275
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:42,236
I remember,
drowning accident.

276
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,946
What do you want to know?

277
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:45,948
Well, what can you
tell me about it?

278
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,534
Just that the town
was pretty shaken up.

279
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,745
Did you say you
were his brother?

280
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,127
<i>MAN:
911, what's your emergency?</i>

281
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:00,630
WOMAN:
911? Thank God!

282
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:03,174
My friend went swimming
in Sandy Beach!

283
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,843
A wave came and he's gone!

284
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,054
I can't find him!

285
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:10,306
I don't know, a half hour!

286
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:12,600
His name is Brandon Booth!

287
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:14,060
Brandon Booth!

288
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:16,020
Yes, hurry please!

289
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:26,572
That was great, Beth.

290
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:29,200
No one's ever gonna know.

291
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:31,994
Beth, there's nothing
we can do about it, ok?

292
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,704
It was an accident.

293
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:45,716
Geez...Brother goes
searching for his brother

294
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:48,970
after they were separated
in a foster home as kids,

295
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,597
only to find that he's dead
when he comes looking for him.

296
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:54,517
That is a hell of a story!

297
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,935
You want to do
a feature, kid?

298
00:23:55,977 --> 00:24:01,232
Brandon was with someone the
night he died, is that right?

299
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:05,153
Let me see, it was
a long time ago, um...

300
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,029
Yes, he was with a girl.

301
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,531
Good kid.

302
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:10,533
She seemed pretty broken up
about the whole thing.

303
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:13,286
Ah, what was her name?

304
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:15,496
Rebecca.

305
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:18,040
Becky.

306
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,917
It was Beth.

307
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,271
Donald Buckley,
is that you?

308
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:41,564
It's me, Beth.

309
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:43,983
We were on yearbook
staff together.

310
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:51,866
Oh my God!

311
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:55,786
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to startle you.

312
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,788
No, no, it's just...

313
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:02,502
I know, I look
just like him.

314
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:06,839
I'm Liam,
Brandon's brother.

315
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:08,799
Brandon's...

316
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:09,634
Brandon never
mentioned he had...

317
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:12,094
He never knew I existed.

318
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,597
Can we talk?

319
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:16,557
It's Beth, right?

320
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:18,559
I saw your picture
in the yearbook.

321
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:21,562
Um, this is a really bad time.

322
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:25,483
Ok, yeah, I get it.

323
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:26,526
Of course.

324
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:29,946
Um, well, I'll be in
town for a few days.

325
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:31,656
Here, let me...

326
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:43,292
Here's my number.

327
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:45,962
I'd love to ask you a few
questions about Brandon...

328
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:49,757
What he was like,
things he liked to do.

329
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,384
I really have to go.

330
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:53,928
I didn't mean to scare you!

331
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:16,534
Beth?

332
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:18,452
I'm Kelly.

333
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:21,163
Jessie left her keys.

334
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:48,774
Hi, Helen.

335
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,278
What do you want?

336
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,572
Oh, I don't want anything.

337
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:59,619
I just wanted to tell
you that I'm sorry.

338
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:02,580
Helen?

339
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:05,958
I'm apologizing to you, ok?

340
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,378
I'm sorry.

341
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:17,345
My mother had to read the letter
you forged from the doctors...

342
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,976
Do you know what it's like
for your mother to think

343
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:25,645
you're HIV positive?

344
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:27,521
Enough with the drama, Helen.

345
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:30,024
It was all in good fun.

346
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:32,526
Are you fucking
kidding me?

347
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:35,112
Telling everybody I had
a tainted blood transfusion

348
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,907
when I was really sick is fun?

349
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:39,909
It was high school, Helen.

350
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,912
People do stupid things.

351
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:45,206
I apologize.

352
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:47,124
Really.

353
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:56,050
I hope you die.

354
00:27:56,092 --> 00:28:01,806
I hope something really
horrible happens to you.

355
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:06,560
You're cruel and pathetic
and you don't even deserve

356
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:10,690
to say you're sorry.

357
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:22,535
Everything alright?

358
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:43,741
Hi there.

359
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,204
Hi.

360
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,325
Hey Jessie, it's Blake.

361
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,827
I got your text,
I'm on my way.

362
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,034
This is Lincoln One Mary.

363
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:38,327
I am 10-7, out of service.

364
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:39,161
Repeat.

365
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:41,038
10-7, out of service.

366
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,998
<i>Copy Lincoln One Mary.</i>

What the fuck is this?

381
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,499
God damn it!

382
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,626
What did you
give him anyway?

383
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:16,545
A couple roofies.

384
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,046
He's fine.

385
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:20,632
This is mean, Jimmy,
it's cruel.

386
00:38:20,674 --> 00:38:23,969
He never did
anything to you.

387
00:38:24,011 --> 00:38:25,220
Oh no?

388
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:27,097
He only follows you
all around on campus.

389
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:28,098
Oh, come on.

390
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,975
Your fairy little
lap dog.

391
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:33,145
Yeah, wait 'til he sees himself
online in the morning.

392
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:35,063
Start digging-

393
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:39,401
C'mon, Beth.

394
00:38:39,443 --> 00:38:43,530
This is my last prank,
I swear.

395
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:47,200
Please?

396
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:49,161
That a girl!

397
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:52,331
Alright, so I think we should
put the hole here.

398
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:54,416
I'll throw him in.

399
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:32,079
Jessie?

400
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,413
So Jessie never even talked
to you this evening then?

401
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:16,123
No.

402
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:18,458
She just left you her
keys where she works?

403
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,501
That's right.

404
00:40:19,543 --> 00:40:20,544
She never told you
where she was going,

405
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:21,837
what she was doing?

406
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:23,547
No.

407
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:26,716
Did she ever talk about going
to see an old classmate,

408
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:31,930
someone she might have
pulled a prank on?

409
00:40:31,972 --> 00:40:34,391
What do you mean prank?

410
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:36,852
You think this has something
to do with high school?

411
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,478
Did Blake ever do anything
back in high school

412
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,565
that would make someone
want to hurt him?

413
00:40:58,582 --> 00:41:01,835
What were you doing,
what were you doing?

414
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:08,675
Someone, whoever it is, didn't
appreciate their sense of humor.

415
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:16,766
Is it safe to stay here?

416
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:20,437
I don't think it's safe
anywhere in Grace Arbor, Beth.

417
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:27,068
Did you ever do anything
to anybody in high school?

418
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,196
No.

419
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,242
Good.

420
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:36,328
You might want to
lock your door.

421
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:23,750
Sheriff, can you
tell us anything?

422
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,210
Are the victims from
Grace Arbor High School?

423
00:42:25,252 --> 00:42:27,254
We're still identifying
the bodies.

424
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:28,672
I have no new information
for you,

425
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:30,924
we need to notify the families,
that's all I have for you now.

426
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:32,050
Thank you.

427
00:42:32,092 --> 00:42:33,510
Can you tell us what
year they graduated?

428
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:35,345
No Jack, I can't.

429
00:42:35,387 --> 00:42:37,347
Well, does this have anything
to do with the Edwards case?

430
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:38,598
Don' push it, Jack!

431
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,517
Asshole.

432
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:42,978
And there you have it,
no word yet if the two victims

433
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,729
are from Grace Arbor
High School.

434
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:48,692
This is Mara Simone outside
the crime scene for Action News.

435
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,151
Alright, so who
do we have?

436
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:53,363
Ronald Wallace.

437
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:54,698
That pecker boy
from the bathroom?

438
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,074
Ok great.

439
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:57,617
What about
Helen Guimond?

440
00:42:57,659 --> 00:42:59,035
Ah, she was working.

441
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,620
Nobody knows what
time she got off.

442
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:01,788
Put her on the list.

443
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:04,583
Ok, so who do we have?

444
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:05,709
<i>C'mon.</i>

445
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,961
Um, Debbie Simmons,
Rita Snavely.

446
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:09,170
I need guys, GUYS-

447
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:10,839
Timothy Thaler.

448
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,048
Bruce Butler.

449
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,008
Donald Buckley.

450
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:15,051
Jesus Christ!

451
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:16,511
Jessie and Blake were murdered!

452
00:43:16,553 --> 00:43:18,513
What the fuck is
wrong with you two?

453
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:21,057
Courtney, we can't
go to the cops, okay?

454
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:23,310
And we can't tell them
what happened to Brandon.

455
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:25,312
The only way we get out of this
is if we find out

456
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:26,813
who is doing the killing.

457
00:43:49,169 --> 00:43:50,503
It's Beth.

458
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:04,934
She was my best friend.

459
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:09,022
How are you, Beth?

460
00:44:09,064 --> 00:44:11,316
Don't ask.

461
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:13,568
So what's going on?

462
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:15,987
The Sheriff came by
Jessie's house last night.

463
00:44:16,029 --> 00:44:17,447
Sheriff Morello.

464
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:21,326
He thinks someone in Grace
Arbor is getting revenge.

465
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:24,079
So he was here yesterday
looking for the 2010 yearbook?

466
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,163
That's right.

467
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:26,706
And you say it
wasn't here then?

468
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:28,208
No, it wasn't.

469
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:31,544
Reference books aren't
supposed to be checked out.

470
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:36,424
Did he ask
about Brandon?

471
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:37,550
No.

472
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:38,635
He didn't say
anything about it?

473
00:44:38,677 --> 00:44:40,053
No.

474
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:42,305
Just told him about Ronald
Wallace getting fire-crackered.

475
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:43,556
We made a list.

476
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:45,642
Yeah, only half
the friggin' school.

477
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:50,063
What about that teacher,
the one you put the gay porn

478
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:51,648
in his slide projector?

479
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:52,565
Richards?

480
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,359
Gay people aren't
serial killers.

481
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:55,485
No man, what about Dahmer?

482
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:57,195
Remember him?

483
00:44:57,237 --> 00:44:58,321
Right.

484
00:44:58,363 --> 00:45:01,574
Put him on the list.

485
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:03,993
Can you think
of anyone, Ryan?

486
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,412
Something you
might have done?

487
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:09,999
What about Coach Novotska?

488
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:12,627
What did you do?

489
00:45:12,669 --> 00:45:15,130
He blackmailed him into signing
off on his football scholarship.

490
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:16,297
What?

491
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:17,382
You know, I don't think
this is really the time.

492
00:45:17,424 --> 00:45:18,717
Hell yeah,
this is the time!

493
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:19,968
How do you know he didn't do it?

494
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:21,010
Because I just know.

495
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,138
Ryan?

496
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:25,348
What did you do?

497
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:29,227
Aw, fuck, man.

498
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:30,770
Look, I had Courtney
take a couple pictures

499
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:32,272
with Coach Novotska.

500
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:33,898
I put a camera in her car
while she was with him

501
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,608
and she took her top off.

502
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:38,778
I wish that was all I did.

503
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,280
No wonder I'm
so fucked up.

504
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:41,781
You know, you didn't
have to do it, Courtney.

505
00:45:41,823 --> 00:45:43,158
Jesus, Ryan!

506
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:45,410
You were my boyfriend, ok,
I wanted you to go to college!

507
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:47,495
What about you?

508
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:48,580
Please, She doesn't have
anything to worry about.

509
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:52,000
Brandon's dead.

510
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:55,754
Not exactly...

511
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:58,381
Brandon has a twin brother.

512
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:01,760
He's in Grace Arbor and he
wants to know all about him.

513
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:11,102
Shit.

514
00:46:16,775 --> 00:46:17,525
Hey Bobo?

515
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:19,736
I need an age on blue boy.

516
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:22,989
Jimmy Edwards, 22.

517
00:46:23,031 --> 00:46:25,575
What year is his
graduating class?

518
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:27,243
2010.

519
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,085
Hey?

520
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:38,671
What about that kid that
drowned over at Sandy Beach?

521
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:41,174
Got a graduating year
on him?

522
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:45,178
This is sick, man.

523
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,888
Yeah, what do you
suggest we do, Nathan?

524
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:48,264
You want to call
the police?

525
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:53,520
Room 122, great,
be there in five minutes.

526
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:54,813
You don't have
to do this, Beth.

527
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:57,273
I'm fine, ok, I'm fine.

528
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,025
Ya see that?
She's fine.

529
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:00,193
Yeah well, you're
not the one going in --

530
00:47:00,235 --> 00:47:01,486
Nathan, I'm fine!

531
00:47:01,528 --> 00:47:03,321
I can handle it.

532
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,114
How did he sound?

533
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:06,241
I mean, he doesn't
expect anything.

534
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:08,326
He just wants to
talk about Brandon.

535
00:47:08,368 --> 00:47:09,160
Ok.

536
00:47:09,202 --> 00:47:10,286
What if I find something?

537
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,871
Like a murder weapon?

538
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:15,959
What do you think
she should do?

539
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,252
Ah, that's great.

540
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:18,962
Send her in some hotel room
with a fucking serial killer

541
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:20,505
and you don't know
what she should do.

542
00:47:21,381 --> 00:47:22,715
Hey wait, wait, wait.

543
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:23,716
Alright, maybe Nathan's right.

544
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:24,717
Maybe you don't have to go in.

545
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:28,471
No, I have to...l want to.

546
00:47:41,568 --> 00:47:42,902
What if he's the killer?

547
00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:46,239
Well, then we'll find out it's
him when she shows up dead.

548
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:12,390
Relax, Nathan.

549
00:48:12,432 --> 00:48:14,350
The dude isn't going to take
her out in broad daylight

550
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:16,519
in his own hotel room.

551
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:22,609
I didn't think you
were going to come.

552
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:25,153
Why do you say that?

553
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:28,531
Strange motel,
strange person.

554
00:48:36,456 --> 00:48:39,459
So...

555
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,670
What do you want to
know about Brandon?

556
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:50,678
What was he like?

557
00:48:55,558 --> 00:49:00,772
He was very generous.

558
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:07,070
Kind...smart, really smart.

559
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:08,363
He liked to read.

560
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:11,616
I always thought he was
going to be a writer one day.

561
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:14,285
Really?

562
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:18,414
Brandon had a way
of seeing things.

563
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:20,249
He liked to laugh.

564
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,210
He had a sense of humor, too.

565
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:30,343
Dark, but he was very hopeful.

566
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:34,514
I think that's why
I liked being around him.

567
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:40,520
You always felt hopeful
when you were around him.

568
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:42,939
Were you his
girlfriend?

569
00:49:42,981 --> 00:49:47,068
Um, I was seeing
someone at the time.

570
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:01,207
I hope you don't
mind me asking...

571
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:06,754
what happened the night
he went swimming?

572
00:50:06,796 --> 00:50:08,423
The night he went swimming?

573
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:10,800
God...

574
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:13,886
Uh...

575
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:21,310
I, uh, told him not to go.

576
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:26,024
The undertow was really strong.

577
00:50:32,155 --> 00:50:36,200
He wanted to anyway.

578
00:50:42,749 --> 00:50:46,753
It was night.

579
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:51,466
Oh God, it was so horrible.

580
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:54,635
I'm sorry.

581
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:57,263
Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm just
really jumpy lately.

582
00:50:57,305 --> 00:51:00,058
I don't blame you.

583
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:06,481
She's been in there
forever, I'm going in.

584
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:07,523
Nathan, just wait.

585
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:11,944
Hey, hey!

586
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:13,279
Beth, you ok?

587
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:16,365
Ryan, I'm leaving town
for a couple days, I'm sorry.

588
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:17,742
<i>You're what?</i>

589
00:51:17,784 --> 00:51:20,036
Look, I have some business
I have to take care of, alright?

590
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:21,454
I gotta get out.

591
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:23,664
You <i>don't</i> have any fucking
business somewhere else, <i>ok?</i>

592
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:24,665
We're supposed to
stick to the plan,

593
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:26,000
we're gonna stick
together, alright?

594
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:28,336
If you don't do that, this
all goes to shit and we die.

595
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:30,004
Ok, Ryan, I am really
freaked out about

596
00:51:30,046 --> 00:51:32,090
everything that's
happening, ok?

597
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:35,051
You have my number.

598
00:51:35,093 --> 00:51:36,302
Court.

599
00:51:36,344 --> 00:51:38,513
Shit!

600
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:41,224
Fuck!

601
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:45,770
Two people were
killed last night.

602
00:51:45,812 --> 00:51:47,688
Did you know them?

603
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:50,858
I think I should go.

604
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,820
Aren't you forgetting
something?

605
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:55,947
Hey!

606
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:57,949
You forgot
your cell phone.

607
00:52:09,085 --> 00:52:10,962
Thank you.

608
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:17,301
Look, I know
this isn't easy,

609
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:20,763
but I feel like I know
Brandon a little better now.

610
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:22,598
He must have been a
really special person

611
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,768
to have you
as a friend.

612
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:28,771
Thank you.

613
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:33,609
So...what do you do to keep
yourself occupied around here?

614
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:37,864
Oh gosh...l don't know anymore,
it's been such a long time.

615
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:41,284
Well, do you want
to grab dinner?

616
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:42,702
Um...

617
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:46,664
<i>On me.</i>

618
00:52:46,706 --> 00:52:49,584
There's a place
called Moore's Pub.

619
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:50,960
It's on Main.

620
00:52:51,002 --> 00:52:52,461
8:00?

621
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:53,963
8:00 is great.

622
00:52:54,005 --> 00:52:56,799
Cool.

623
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:59,927
Alright.

624
00:52:59,969 --> 00:53:03,431
Um, take care.

625
00:53:03,472 --> 00:53:07,143
I will.

626
00:53:07,185 --> 00:53:09,020
Yeah, it's...

627
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:32,710
So?

628
00:53:32,752 --> 00:53:34,253
It's not him.

629
00:53:34,295 --> 00:53:35,421
He's not a murderer.

630
00:53:35,463 --> 00:53:38,424
No, no, how do you know?

631
00:53:38,466 --> 00:53:40,843
Because he's just like Brandon.

632
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:22,677
Liam, Jack Meyer from
the Grace <i>Arbor</i> Gazette .

633
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:24,345
I have some information
about your brother

634
00:54:24,387 --> 00:54:27,098
that you may find
very interesting.

635
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:28,474
Give me a call.

636
00:54:30,643 --> 00:54:31,727
<i>Got 'em.</i>

637
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:32,561
Yeah.

638
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,855
Nothing gets
by you, Jack.

639
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,763
Hello?

640
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:09,974
Yeah, he's here.

641
00:55:10,016 --> 00:55:13,185
Yeah, just a second.

642
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:14,687
It's for you.

643
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:18,941
Mr. Richards?

644
00:55:18,983 --> 00:55:21,902
This is Nathan Nesbitt
from Grace Arbor High.

645
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:23,404
Uh...

646
00:55:23,446 --> 00:55:26,240
Listen, I just wanted to
apologize for putting that porn

647
00:55:26,282 --> 00:55:28,117
in your slide projector.

648
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:31,537
It's, it's been really
bothering me lately.

649
00:55:43,132 --> 00:55:48,262
Ronald?

650
00:55:48,304 --> 00:55:50,931
You got a sec?

651
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:04,779
We'll get rid of this little
chubbiness right there.

652
00:59:47,876 --> 00:59:50,296
She is practically gift wrapped.

653
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:53,215
Oh man, just the way
I like 'em.

654
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:55,634
Whoo, alright.

655
01:00:01,724 --> 01:00:05,352
Hi.

656
01:00:05,394 --> 01:00:08,272
You live here?

657
01:00:08,314 --> 01:00:10,524
What are you doing?

658
01:00:10,566 --> 01:00:15,654
Just striking up a
conversation with a hot chick.

659
01:00:15,696 --> 01:00:16,697
Really?

660
01:00:16,739 --> 01:00:17,698
A hot chick?

661
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:18,365
Yeah.

662
01:00:18,407 --> 01:00:19,867
How sweet.

663
01:00:24,622 --> 01:00:26,582
Look at me.

664
01:00:26,624 --> 01:00:27,708
Oh, I'm looking at you.

665
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:30,669
No, I want you to look at me.

666
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:33,672
Why? See you for
who you are?

667
01:00:33,714 --> 01:00:35,090
Something like that.

668
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:37,176
Are you looking?

669
01:00:37,217 --> 01:00:39,178
I'm peering
into your soul.

670
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:40,220
Good.

671
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:42,306
Now start the
conversation from the top.

672
01:00:42,348 --> 01:00:44,391
Whoa, I like this.

673
01:00:44,433 --> 01:00:45,476
A little role playing.

674
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:48,312
Go!

675
01:00:48,354 --> 01:00:49,897
Alright.

676
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:52,733
Two strangers in a bar.

677
01:00:52,775 --> 01:00:53,942
From the top.

678
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:57,112
Alright, here we go.

679
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:58,530
Hi.

680
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:00,366
You live here?

681
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:02,493
Fantastic.

682
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:03,994
You're really looking
at me now, aren't you?

683
01:01:04,036 --> 01:01:07,498
Oh, I'm virtually
undressing you as we speak.

684
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:09,166
Great.

685
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:11,460
Because I wouldn't
fuck you if you were

686
01:01:11,502 --> 01:01:13,962
the last living
thing on earth.

687
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:23,263
Don't take it so hard.

688
01:01:23,305 --> 01:01:25,057
I'm lousy in bed.

689
01:01:25,099 --> 01:01:26,850
I see a therapist twice
a week, I'm on medication.

690
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:28,852
I wouldn't fuck me either.

691
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:37,861
Thanks for the warning.

692
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:38,696
Fuckin' bitch.

693
01:01:38,737 --> 01:01:40,948
What was that?

694
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:42,616
What, man?

695
01:01:42,658 --> 01:01:44,576
Is there a problem?

696
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:45,744
No problem at all.

697
01:01:45,786 --> 01:01:47,079
She's all yours.

698
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:49,123
Let's get the
fuck out of here.

699
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:58,382
Well, well, if it isn't
Prince Charming to the rescue

700
01:01:58,424 --> 01:01:59,717
after four hours.

701
01:01:59,758 --> 01:02:02,177
I'm sorry.

702
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:04,054
I had some things
to take of.

703
01:02:04,096 --> 01:02:07,057
Must have been important.

704
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:10,018
We need to talk
about Brandon.

705
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:13,897
I thought that's what
we were here to do.

706
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:16,692
Now.

707
01:02:16,734 --> 01:02:20,154
Jesus Christ, Sheriff,
now I've seen it all.

708
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:25,075
That bad, huh?

709
01:02:25,117 --> 01:02:26,785
This is the receptionist.

710
01:02:26,827 --> 01:02:28,912
Holy shit!

711
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:30,414
Oh, it get's better.

712
01:02:30,456 --> 01:02:32,666
Wait 'til you see
what's in the lipo room.

713
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:35,419
Her name's Courtney Brenan.

714
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:37,963
She's from Grace Arbor.

715
01:02:51,143 --> 01:02:52,436
Hey Bro!

716
01:02:52,478 --> 01:02:53,729
Chick's bad news, man.

717
01:02:53,771 --> 01:02:54,813
Get in the car.

718
01:02:54,855 --> 01:02:56,356
Yeah man,
she's a fucking cunt.

719
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:59,193
Hey! Get in the car now!

720
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:01,695
And if she's a fucking
cunt, what's that make you?

721
01:03:01,737 --> 01:03:04,782
I'll tell you what,
that makes him a cunt fucker.

722
01:03:04,823 --> 01:03:06,575
Yeah! Yeah!

723
01:03:06,617 --> 01:03:07,826
What'd you just call me?

724
01:03:11,205 --> 01:03:12,873
Yeah, that's what
I called you, c'mon!

725
01:03:12,915 --> 01:03:13,999
Slice him up, bro.

726
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:15,918
Let's go, let's go,
I'm going to fuck you up.

727
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:28,430
Mother fucker!

728
01:03:57,459 --> 01:03:59,211
Give me the keys.

729
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:06,176
Give me the keys!

730
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:39,793
What are you doing?

731
01:04:39,835 --> 01:04:42,045
You haven't been
honest with me, Beth!

732
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:43,755
You ever hear
of Jack Meyer?

733
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:45,549
He's a reporter.

734
01:04:45,591 --> 01:04:49,094
Slime, but he had some pretty
interesting things to say.

735
01:04:49,136 --> 01:04:51,555
Why didn't you tell me
Brandon was taking drugs

736
01:04:51,597 --> 01:04:52,514
the night he died?

737
01:04:52,556 --> 01:04:53,473
What do you
want from me?

738
01:04:53,515 --> 01:04:55,767
It was three years
ago, ok, I forgot!

739
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:57,185
Why did you let
him go swimming?

740
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:59,563
Because I didn't know
he was on medication.

741
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:02,941
I don't believe you.

742
01:05:02,983 --> 01:05:04,526
Look, I don't
owe you anything.

743
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:06,945
You owe him, Beth!

744
01:05:06,987 --> 01:05:08,030
You were his friend.

745
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:09,281
You see this?

746
01:05:09,323 --> 01:05:11,742
I have a fucking
drugstore in my purse.

747
01:05:11,783 --> 01:05:14,202
I don't tell every
person I know.

748
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:17,122
He never told me.

749
01:05:17,164 --> 01:05:22,377
I didn't know he was
going to die, ok?

750
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:25,380
I didn't know he
was going to die!

751
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:42,606
Oh God! Brandon!

752
01:05:42,648 --> 01:05:44,316
Brandon!

753
01:05:44,358 --> 01:05:45,442
Where is he?

754
01:05:45,484 --> 01:05:46,151
I don't know.

755
01:05:46,193 --> 01:05:48,320
Find him!

756
01:05:48,362 --> 01:05:49,780
Brandon!

757
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:52,115
He's got to be
here somewhere.

758
01:05:52,157 --> 01:05:55,243
Brandon!

759
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:56,703
Listen, he probably
woke up and left.

760
01:05:56,745 --> 01:05:58,580
He probably
already left!

761
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:00,123
Fuck you!

762
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:01,249
What did you do?

763
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:02,960
I don't know, we'll
keep looking for him.

764
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:05,754
Brandon, if you're out
here, it's not funny!

765
01:06:08,048 --> 01:06:11,843
What did you do?

766
01:06:25,983 --> 01:06:27,651
I'm sorry.

767
01:06:34,449 --> 01:06:37,285
It's alright.

768
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,243
Oh my God!

769
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:42,869
Courtney, no!

770
01:08:42,911 --> 01:08:44,162
When did it happen?

771
01:08:44,204 --> 01:08:45,914
Tonight.

772
01:08:45,956 --> 01:08:49,543
It was on the news.

773
01:08:49,584 --> 01:08:50,794
Are you sure
it's her?

774
01:08:50,836 --> 01:08:52,003
Courtney said she
was leaving town

775
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:53,964
and someone was
killed in Sterling.

776
01:08:54,005 --> 01:08:56,174
It's her.

777
01:08:59,136 --> 01:09:01,471
So where were you two tonight?

778
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:24,202
Did you tell
him anything?

779
01:09:24,244 --> 01:09:26,413
What do you
think, Nathan?

780
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:28,874
Fucking Brandon's brother isn't
going to bring him back, Beth.

781
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,132
You just
better not.

782
01:09:47,058 --> 01:09:51,521
You're a regular killing
machine, aren't you, Liam?

783
01:09:51,563 --> 01:09:55,150
Where were you tonight?

784
01:09:55,192 --> 01:09:56,318
Where were you?

785
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:57,986
What is it with you people
in this town, huh?

786
01:09:58,028 --> 01:10:00,906
What'd you do for
fun last night?

787
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:05,160
Well, you have to admit,
you make a great suspect.

788
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:24,304
It's from Brandon.

789
01:10:24,346 --> 01:10:28,308
He and I never met, but we did
write each other in high school.

790
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:31,853
Then the letters stopped
and I never knew why.

791
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:35,565
Go ahead, read it, Beth.

792
01:10:35,607 --> 01:10:37,859
He talks about you a lot.

793
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:54,167
You wanna know why
I came to Grace Arbor?

794
01:10:54,209 --> 01:11:01,132
I just wanted to know that there
was some light somewhere.

795
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:08,265
That just maybe, Brandon had
a better life than I had.

796
01:11:23,363 --> 01:11:25,782
<i>It's all so clear to me now.</i>

797
01:11:25,824 --> 01:11:27,867
<i>How do I know it's love?</i>

798
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:30,578
<i>I think I would die for her.</i>

799
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:38,670
Liam! Liam!

800
01:11:52,392 --> 01:11:53,727
Dude, I've been trying
to get a hold of you.

801
01:11:53,768 --> 01:11:54,602
Where you've been?

802
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:56,396
Chill man, I went to Sterling.

803
01:11:56,438 --> 01:11:57,689
I talked to Coach Novotska.

804
01:11:57,731 --> 01:11:59,107
Coach Novotska?

805
01:11:59,149 --> 01:12:01,318
Yeah, I thought
I should apologize.

806
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:03,820
He said he did a lot of asshole
things, too, but he was cool.

807
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:12,495
I saw them take
her body out.

808
01:12:12,537 --> 01:12:14,914
Dude, it's Brandon's
brother.

809
01:12:14,956 --> 01:12:15,874
Check this.

810
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:19,669
His real name is
Liam Bennett.

811
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,379
He was molested by
both his parents.

812
01:12:21,421 --> 01:12:23,757
They kept him in the basement
for like three years.

813
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:25,800
Dude took his father's
shotgun, killed them both.

814
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:27,761
Then he shot himself
in the chest and lived.

815
01:12:27,802 --> 01:12:30,805
He, he was exonerated by the
courts because he was a minor.

816
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:35,977
He underwent major
psychiatric counseling.

817
01:12:36,019 --> 01:12:36,978
There's your killer.

818
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:37,979
He knows what
happened to Brandon.

819
01:12:38,021 --> 01:12:41,024
He knows we're involved.

820
01:12:41,066 --> 01:12:41,816
Beth.

821
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:43,610
She told him.

822
01:12:45,737 --> 01:12:47,489
Fucking Beth told him!

823
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,119
<i>"W: I'm here in Sterling where
police have cordoned off</i>

824
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:37,497
<i>the area of what I have been
told is a grisly murder scene.</i>

825
01:13:37,539 --> 01:13:38,957
<i>At the present time,
it is unclear</i>

826
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:40,792
<i>how many people inside are dead.</i>

827
01:13:40,834 --> 01:13:45,672
I want insider access and
a cover story on his arrest.

828
01:13:45,713 --> 01:13:46,923
<i>We got a deal?</i>

829
01:13:46,965 --> 01:13:48,216
What's his name, Jack?

830
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:51,886
Ah, give me a second.

831
01:14:26,588 --> 01:14:29,716
His name is Liam Bennett,
but he goes by Rivers.

832
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:32,594
He's staying at the Motel
down by the highway.

833
01:14:33,845 --> 01:14:35,472
Son of a bitch!

834
01:14:38,766 --> 01:14:41,269
<i>Jack?</i>

835
01:14:41,311 --> 01:14:43,062
<i>Jack are you there?</i>

836
01:14:58,161 --> 01:14:59,996
<i>Jack?</i>

837
01:15:00,038 --> 01:15:01,956
<i>Jack is that you?</i>

838
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:15,220
Liam, it's me Beth!

839
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:17,680
We have to talk!

840
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:22,852
Liam, open up!

841
01:15:22,894 --> 01:15:24,854
We can't stay here!

842
01:15:24,896 --> 01:15:27,774
Trust me, it's not safe!

843
01:15:27,815 --> 01:15:29,067
<i>C'mon.</i>

844
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:32,237
This is 8 David 4.

845
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:34,989
Request a unit be sent
to 713 Whitney Ave.

846
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:36,866
To check the welfare
of Jack Meyer.

847
01:15:36,908 --> 01:15:38,409
I'm in route to the motel
by the Highway.

848
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:40,119
Will advise when I'm 9/7.

849
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,045
Fucking Beth, man!

850
01:15:49,087 --> 01:15:50,213
I never trusted
that bitch.

851
01:15:50,255 --> 01:15:51,965
RSI-Ryan!

852
01:16:01,933 --> 01:16:03,851
Fuck man!
Where did he come from?

853
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:09,774
Dude, dude, dude,
it's the Sheriff.

854
01:16:09,816 --> 01:16:11,943
We almost hit
the fucking Sheriff.

855
01:16:11,985 --> 01:16:13,903
Shit.

856
01:16:19,784 --> 01:16:22,078
Oh, we gotta go,
we gotta go, we gotta go.

857
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:32,213
That's not mine.

858
01:16:32,255 --> 01:16:33,965
I didn't put that there.

859
01:16:34,007 --> 01:16:36,718
It wasn't me.

860
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:37,927
Let's go.

861
01:16:37,969 --> 01:16:39,929
Let's, c'mon, let's just go,
let's go, let's go!

862
01:16:55,445 --> 01:16:57,739
Someone put it
in my room.

863
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:59,657
Who, Beth?

864
01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:04,120
You're the only one who
knows where I was staying.

865
01:17:04,162 --> 01:17:05,455
I wasn't thinking.

866
01:17:05,496 --> 01:17:07,999
I mean, I brought them because
I thought you might...

867
01:17:13,671 --> 01:17:18,885
It's Nathan or Ryan...

868
01:17:18,926 --> 01:17:20,678
Oh my God.

869
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:24,098
Why did you go
to Sterling?

870
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:25,642
I went to talk to
Coach Novotska, ok?

871
01:17:25,683 --> 01:17:26,559
You don't believe me?

872
01:17:26,601 --> 01:17:27,352
Call him!

873
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:28,478
Fuck man.

874
01:17:28,519 --> 01:17:30,563
I don't know who
to believe anymore.

875
01:17:30,605 --> 01:17:32,190
Nathan, if I wanted you dead,
you would have been

876
01:17:32,231 --> 01:17:33,900
first on my list.

877
01:17:50,792 --> 01:17:54,253
I know what happened to you.

878
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:40,258
It's Beth.

879
01:19:00,445 --> 01:19:03,281
Get out of the car, Beth!

880
01:19:15,293 --> 01:19:19,088
There was a game
we played in therapy.

881
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:21,674
Did you know that, Beth?

882
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:30,141
C'mon Beth,
you can do it.

883
01:19:30,975 --> 01:19:33,060
Liam, I'm sorry for what
happened to you, ok.

884
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:34,479
We all have fucked up pasts!

885
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:37,982
I'm not finished, Beth.

886
01:19:38,024 --> 01:19:42,153
The shrinks thought it was
important in my healing.

887
01:19:42,195 --> 01:19:45,656
It's called
re-association.

888
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:48,034
You re-live the
moment of trauma

889
01:19:48,075 --> 01:19:51,621
and go back to
where it all began.

890
01:19:51,662 --> 01:19:53,831
Can you imagine?

891
01:19:53,873 --> 01:19:58,169
Most kids are out playing
football, going to their proms.

892
01:19:58,211 --> 01:20:01,923
I was having my dreams
analyzed by ten-dollar-an-hour

893
01:20:01,964 --> 01:20:06,594
therapists who fondled me
in the name of mental health.

894
01:20:10,681 --> 01:20:14,101
Where did it
happen, Beth?

895
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:15,269
Liam...I'm.

896
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:18,856
Where did it happen?

897
01:20:25,863 --> 01:20:27,824
Right there.

898
01:20:56,143 --> 01:20:57,353
You want to know
what the worst part

899
01:20:57,395 --> 01:21:03,067
about killing
your parents is?

900
01:21:03,109 --> 01:21:06,404
Think about it, Beth.

901
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:09,156
It's the guilt.

902
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:14,662
I actually felt guilty for
taking those monsters' lives.

903
01:21:14,704 --> 01:21:18,040
Guilt is a motherfucker,
isn't it?

904
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:23,087
It eats away at your
aspirations, your dreams,

905
01:21:23,129 --> 01:21:25,715
your fucking soul!

906
01:21:30,094 --> 01:21:34,932
You having a hard time
sleeping at night, Beth?

907
01:21:34,974 --> 01:21:37,518
What did you do to him?

908
01:21:39,854 --> 01:21:42,607
It was just supposed
to be a prank.

909
01:21:42,648 --> 01:21:45,943
Jimmy was jealous of Brandon,
he buried him in the sand

910
01:21:45,985 --> 01:21:48,613
after giving him some pills
at a party.

911
01:21:48,654 --> 01:21:50,823
He was only supposed to be
unconscious for an hour.

912
01:21:50,865 --> 01:21:54,493
But we fell asleep
and the tide came in.

913
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:29,862
Well, Beth...

914
01:22:29,904 --> 01:22:34,533
I guess there's only
one thing left to do.

915
01:22:34,575 --> 01:22:38,371
I'm really sorry
about this.

916
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:46,504
I'm taking you
to the police.

917
01:22:46,545 --> 01:22:50,091
Nobody's taking
anybody anywhere.

918
01:22:50,132 --> 01:22:52,551
Hate to inform you, buddy,
but you've got a serious

919
01:22:52,593 --> 01:22:53,719
credibility issue.

920
01:22:53,761 --> 01:22:56,555
Yeah, unstable psychopath
who murdered his parents

921
01:22:56,597 --> 01:22:58,391
seeking to cleanse
his demons away

922
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:00,351
by avenging his brother's death?

923
01:23:00,393 --> 01:23:03,229
Do you really think the cops
are going to believe you?

924
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:04,897
They don't have to believe me.

925
01:23:04,939 --> 01:23:06,649
They'll believe her.

926
01:23:08,943 --> 01:23:11,028
I can't do it anymore.

927
01:23:11,070 --> 01:23:12,697
I can't keep the secret.

928
01:23:12,738 --> 01:23:15,741
Beth, you're being a little over
emotional, don't you think, hm?

929
01:23:15,783 --> 01:23:16,909
They're going to
put us all away.

930
01:23:16,951 --> 01:23:18,119
Especially you, Beth.

931
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,328
You were there.

932
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:20,496
We should have told the
truth from the beginning.

933
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:24,792
C'mon, Beth.

934
01:23:24,834 --> 01:23:26,293
See ya later, fellas.

935
01:23:26,335 --> 01:23:27,962
Have a nice life.

936
01:23:28,004 --> 01:23:29,296
You fucking cowards.

937
01:23:29,338 --> 01:23:32,425
You oughta think twice.

938
01:23:32,466 --> 01:23:34,343
Jesus, Ryan.

939
01:23:34,385 --> 01:23:35,720
What are you doing?

940
01:23:35,761 --> 01:23:37,471
Stay out of this, Nathan!

941
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:39,640
Showing your
true colors, Ryan?

942
01:23:39,682 --> 01:23:41,267
Shut the fuck up, asshole!

943
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:43,811
Why'd you take all
your friends out, Ryan?

944
01:23:43,853 --> 01:23:45,730
Afraid someone
might crack?

945
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:47,857
Afraid someone might tell
the truth about Brandon?

946
01:23:47,898 --> 01:23:49,025
Don't fuck with me, man!

947
01:23:49,066 --> 01:23:54,280
Jimmy was the first
to crumble, wasn't he?

948
01:23:54,321 --> 01:23:56,157
He couldn't take the guilt
over Brandon's death

949
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:57,616
so he was going to
turn himself in,

950
01:23:57,658 --> 01:24:00,494
but you couldn't have that.

951
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:03,914
No, you had to killed Jimmy.

952
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:07,543
But then you had to kill,
Blake, Jessie, Courtney!

953
01:24:07,585 --> 01:24:11,172
One more word and I swear,
I will fucking kill you!

954
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:14,717
Did you do it, Ryan?

955
01:24:14,759 --> 01:24:15,676
Stay outta this, Nathan!

956
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:16,719
Ryan, did you do it?

957
01:24:16,761 --> 01:24:18,220
What do you think, bro?

958
01:24:19,430 --> 01:24:21,891
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

959
01:25:07,937 --> 01:25:10,022
Drop it!

960
01:25:10,064 --> 01:25:12,525
Drop the weapon!

961
01:25:13,651 --> 01:25:17,738
So this is how it's
done in Grace Arbor?

962
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:20,366
Last time!

963
01:25:20,407 --> 01:25:25,162
Put your hands above your
head and drop the weapon!

964
01:25:36,423 --> 01:25:41,720
NO! No!

965
01:25:41,762 --> 01:25:45,850
Oh my God! Liam.

966
01:25:53,232 --> 01:25:56,986
It's not fair...

967
01:26:03,409 --> 01:26:05,744
It's not fair.

968
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:27,057
It wasn't him!

969
01:26:27,099 --> 01:26:29,435
You son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!

970
01:26:29,476 --> 01:26:32,104
Alright, calm down,
calm down, calm down!

971
01:26:32,146 --> 01:26:36,233
It wasn't him!
It wasn't him!

972
01:26:36,275 --> 01:26:38,277
Put the weapon down!

973
01:29:29,114 --> 01:29:31,867
Shit, shit, shit.

974
01:29:54,932 --> 01:29:59,103
Oh God...Oh God.

975
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:02,272
Help, help!

976
01:30:07,569 --> 01:30:09,780
Help!

977
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:18,414
No, no...

978
01:30:53,574 --> 01:30:56,160
Helen?

979
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:57,327
Oh, hi.

980
01:30:57,369 --> 01:31:01,832
It's Beth, right?

981
01:31:01,874 --> 01:31:04,251
You work here?

982
01:31:04,293 --> 01:31:05,502
Part time.

983
01:31:05,544 --> 01:31:09,173
Things have been really
slow lately at the diner.

984
01:31:13,343 --> 01:31:15,262
Hope you feel better.

985
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:47,878
<i>Did Blake ever do anything
back in high school</i>

986
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:51,215
<i>that would make someone
want to hurt him?</i>

987
01:31:53,592 --> 01:31:56,803
<i>Can you think of anyone, Ryan,
something you might have done?</i>

988
01:31:56,845 --> 01:31:59,056
What about Coach Novotska?

989
01:32:05,395 --> 01:32:06,522
<i>What about that teacher?</i>

990
01:32:06,563 --> 01:32:10,067
<i>Richards? Gay people
aren't serial killers.</i>

991
01:32:10,108 --> 01:32:12,694
Did she ever talk about going
to see an old classmate?

992
01:32:12,736 --> 01:32:15,697
Someone she might have
pulled a prank on?

993
01:33:13,463 --> 01:33:15,841
No, please!

994
01:35:01,863 --> 01:35:03,824
Thanks for the ride,
I appreciate it.

995
01:35:03,865 --> 01:35:08,578
I just wanted to make
sure you got here safely.

996
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:12,416
What are you going to do when
you get back to New York?

997
01:35:12,457 --> 01:35:15,460
Probably find a job.

998
01:35:15,502 --> 01:35:18,296
Good luck with that.

999
01:35:18,338 --> 01:35:24,094
Listen, here's my card...
if you ever wanna talk.

1000
01:35:24,136 --> 01:35:27,097
I told you everything
I know, Sheriff.

1001
01:35:27,139 --> 01:35:31,893
I hope so, Beth...
I really hope so.

1002
01:35:36,022 --> 01:35:37,566
You know when I came out here,
I thought I'd get away

1003
01:35:37,607 --> 01:35:40,986
from the big city,
catch up on my fishing,

1004
01:35:41,027 --> 01:35:46,366
drive the wife wherever
the hell she wants.

1005
01:35:46,408 --> 01:35:49,494
Whoever did this,
I hope they never

1006
01:35:49,536 --> 01:35:53,498
step foot in
Grace Arbor again.

1007
01:36:02,716 --> 01:36:04,843
Good luck to you, Beth.

1008
01:36:04,885 --> 01:36:07,304
Thanks.
