- A little bit, how about you?

9
00:01:43,707 --> 00:01:45,054
- I didn't sleep too well.

10
00:01:45,054 --> 00:01:46,308
I think I'm just excited.

11
00:01:46,308 --> 00:01:49,127

- Hm?

16
00:01:58,806 --> 00:02:00,876
- The stock market, Dad, how's business?

17
00:02:00,876 --> 00:02:02,209
- Oh, it's fine.

18
00:02:03,673 --> 00:02:06,841
So, you all packed up,
ready for the big move?

19
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:11,625
- Yep, everything I have
is ready to go to Canada.

20

really glad you're okay

with our moving.

22
00:02:15,147 --> 00:02:16,665
I didn't think you'd take it this well.

23
00:02:16,665 --> 00:02:18,393
- Why is that?

24
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:20,557
- Well, it's gonna be tough for you.

25
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:25,165
You and Mike, you kids
have been friends forever.

26
00:02:25,165 --> 00:02:28,487
- That Mike, he was always a troublemaker.

27
00:02:28,487 --> 00:02:31,285
- Oh, come on, he is not.

28
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:33,285
I think he's a good boy.

29
00:02:36,551 --> 00:02:38,166
- I guess it hasn't really hit me

30
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,468

00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:46,550
as best as you possibly can.

33
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,711
- Don't worry, Mom, I will.

34
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:50,854
- So, David, I want you to
come right home after school

35
00:02:50,854 --> 00:02:52,518
and help your mom, okay?

36
00:02:52,518 --> 00:02:55,236
- All right, sure, Dad.

37
00:02:55,236 --> 00:02:56,763
- I want you to come home

38
00:02:56,763 --> 00:02:59,318
when you're done hanging
out with your friends.

39
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:00,485

Oh, that's Mike, I gotta go.

- Hey, wait a minute, did
you get enough to eat?

43
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,228
- Yeah, I'm fine, thanks, Mom.

44
00:03:08,228 --> 00:03:10,817
- Well, but you didn't--

45
00:03:10,817 --> 00:03:12,185
- [David] Love you.

46
00:03:12,185 --> 00:03:13,518

just get out of here.

- Okay, eh.

50
00:03:33,142 --> 00:03:35,335

53
00:03:44,982 --> 00:03:46,919
You gotta wear that to school today.

talking about, spank dummy?

my last day in California.

something planned for us, dude?

57
00:03:53,782 --> 00:03:56,421
- Yeah, dude, we're going to Bear.

You gonna rent it up there,
huh, Davey, the fucking newbie.

61
00:04:03,137 --> 00:04:04,629
I told you to bring my fucking shit, dude.

62
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:05,906
I left it at your house.

63
00:04:05,906 --> 00:04:07,172
You were supposed to
bring it this morning.

64
00:04:07,172 --> 00:04:08,170
- You did?

65
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,203

Hey, listen, I heard a
rumor there's a party

at your place tonight, what's the story?

129
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,143

I'll get this guy to go,
don't worry about it.

Do we need to bring anything at all?

140

use another bottle of Jager.

00:08:50,762 --> 00:08:53,993
♫ Is like having sex without getting laid

181
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:57,088
♫ Why wait for things that never comes

182
00:08:57,088 --> 00:09:01,255
♫ Why wait for things that never comes

183
00:09:03,146 --> 00:09:05,063
♫ Why

184
00:09:08,038 --> 00:09:09,451
- Yeah.

185
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:10,284
- Woo.

186
00:09:11,962 --> 00:09:14,156
- Dude, that was so fucking sick.

187
00:09:14,156 --> 00:09:16,339
Did you see how big that
kicker was going off row?

188
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:18,125
He almost got fucking
bird off the top of that.

189
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:21,308
Seriously, Dave, you just had a clean run.

190
00:09:21,308 --> 00:09:22,907
Where are you gonna go?

191
00:09:22,907 --> 00:09:26,936
- Um, I think I'm going
to Cafe Lulu, woohoo.

192
00:09:26,936 --> 00:09:27,769
Woo.

193
00:09:38,735 --> 00:09:39,742
Dude, smell me.

194
00:09:39,742 --> 00:09:40,743
- No, bro.

195
00:09:40,743 --> 00:09:41,742
- Come on, I stink.

196
00:09:41,742 --> 00:09:43,472
- Dude, I could smell you if you stink.

197
00:09:43,472 --> 00:09:44,609
- Just smell me.

198
00:09:44,609 --> 00:09:45,666
- No.

199
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,615
- Fine, you don't know
what you're missing.

200
00:09:47,615 --> 00:09:49,283
- Shut up and order.

201
00:09:49,283 --> 00:09:50,376
- [Waitress] Hi, what can I get you guys?

202
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:53,536
- Um, could we get two
of your specials, Cokes?

203
00:09:53,536 --> 00:09:54,536
- What would you like to drink with that?

204
00:09:54,536 --> 00:09:55,369
- Cokes.

205
00:09:56,912 --> 00:09:57,914
- What for you?

206
00:09:57,914 --> 00:09:58,747
- Yeah.

207
00:10:07,477 --> 00:10:08,642
- All right, man, so listen,

208
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:09,893
are we gonna go to that
party tonight or what?

209
00:10:09,893 --> 00:10:13,240
- Ah, dude, I don't know, man,
I think it's just get packed.

210
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,679
- Come on, man.

211
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:17,497
- Dude, why don't we
just hit up Bowling Barn?

212
00:10:17,497 --> 00:10:18,747
That'd be fine.

213
00:10:19,634 --> 00:10:21,526
- I know, Dave, but there's
gonna be so many hotties there,

214
00:10:21,526 --> 00:10:23,943
you know that, you know that.

215
00:10:26,118 --> 00:10:27,905
- Yeah, all right, dude, we'll go,

216
00:10:27,905 --> 00:10:29,250
but just for like a couple of hours

217
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,250
and then we'll head home.

218
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,084
- Sounds good, bro, that's
what I wanna hear from you.

219
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:36,286
- How we gonna get alcohol
for this thing, man?

220
00:10:36,286 --> 00:10:37,455
- I don't know, I guess we'll pimp it

221
00:10:37,455 --> 00:10:38,656
over at that liquor store, right?

222
00:10:38,656 --> 00:10:41,395
- Ah, dude, I don't
want to have to pimp it.

223
00:10:41,395 --> 00:10:42,650
It takes forever.

224
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,886
Why can't you just get
your brother's ID, man?

225
00:10:43,886 --> 00:10:46,406
- I know, I know, he just
never gave it to me, man.

226
00:10:46,406 --> 00:10:48,156
- Thank you, sweetie.

227
00:10:50,092 --> 00:10:51,787
Dude, that sucks man.

228
00:10:51,787 --> 00:10:53,328
- Dude, tell me about it, he's
my own fucking brother, man.

229
00:10:53,328 --> 00:10:55,061
I mean, I helped the
guy move twice, right,

230
00:10:55,061 --> 00:10:56,942
and all I asked him for for payment

231
00:10:56,942 --> 00:10:58,962
was to get me one of
those IDs so I can use it.

232
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:00,877
And he's all like, no problem,

233
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:02,143
when I'm carrying his couch and shit,

234
00:11:02,143 --> 00:11:04,046
but now he's like too
fucking busy or something.

235
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:06,798
- It's all because of his old lady, man.

236
00:11:06,798 --> 00:11:08,795
- Dude, he's definitely pussy-whipped.

237
00:11:08,795 --> 00:11:10,827
He doesn't do anything
fucking cool anymore.

238
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:14,030
He just fucking, ah, he
can't even be bothered, man.

239
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,075
- I'll never get a full foundation.

240
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,347
- Dude, fuck that, bro.

241
00:11:18,347 --> 00:11:19,774
- Never.

242
00:11:19,774 --> 00:11:20,607
- Fuck no.

243
00:11:21,938 --> 00:11:23,076
- What you guys gotta start doing

244
00:11:23,076 --> 00:11:24,254
is pumping iron and eating right.

245
00:11:24,254 --> 00:11:26,894
And before you know it,
you're gonna turn to fat.

246
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,122
The chicks like a tight body.

247
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:32,129
- Dude, what do you think,
skating and snowboarding

248
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:34,001
keeps us in good enough shape already.

249
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:35,391
- You're not always gonna have
enough time to board, bro.

250
00:11:35,391 --> 00:11:38,041
And besides, you need to put on some size,

251
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,873
get strong, to fend off those injuries.

252
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:42,335
- Look, look, look, guy, that's
some really great advice,

253
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:44,333
but alls we really asked you
for is to get us some beer.

254
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,478
- Hey, look, I'm just trying
to put you on the right path

255
00:11:46,478 --> 00:11:48,142
to a healthy lifestyle.

256
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:49,518
- Look, what would be healthy right now,

257
00:11:49,518 --> 00:11:50,751
would be for me to get some beers,

258
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,364
so I can score some chicks tonight.

259
00:11:52,364 --> 00:11:53,854
- Well, I can't help you with that,

260
00:11:53,854 --> 00:11:56,046
besides, beer's fattening.

261
00:11:56,046 --> 00:11:58,367
Tell you what, though, if you're
looking for a good trainer,

262
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:00,617
here's my card, and listen,

263
00:12:02,862 --> 00:12:05,006
my studio's right by the Bowling Barn.

264
00:12:05,006 --> 00:12:06,847
All right, guys, take care.

265
00:12:06,847 --> 00:12:08,264
- Take care, man.

266
00:12:09,413 --> 00:12:12,413
- You fucking believe this guy, man?

267
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:15,107
- I don't know, man, I think
he had something to say.

268
00:12:15,107 --> 00:12:16,718
- Aw, shit, are you kidding me?

269
00:12:16,718 --> 00:12:18,980
Look, go ask this guy coming
up right here, all right?

270
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,121
- Fuck off, bitch, I asked last time, man.

271
00:12:21,121 --> 00:12:22,926
- Fuck you did, go ask him.

272
00:12:22,926 --> 00:12:26,287
- Stop being such a woman and
go get me some alcohol, man.

273
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,692
- Fuck, fuck, whatever.

274
00:12:27,692 --> 00:12:29,422
I'm gonna ask this chick
coming up right here.

275
00:12:29,422 --> 00:12:30,734
But if she doesn't do it, bro,

276
00:12:30,734 --> 00:12:32,394
you're gonna fucking pull
the runner, all right?

277
00:12:32,394 --> 00:12:34,061
- All right, go, go.

278
00:12:35,064 --> 00:12:37,306
- Excuse me, miss, we left our IDs at home

279
00:12:37,306 --> 00:12:39,145
and we were wondering you could
get us a bottle of Jaeger.

280
00:12:39,145 --> 00:12:40,684
- I'm not 21.

281
00:12:40,684 --> 00:12:42,826
- Yeah, right, what are you, like, 50?

282
00:12:42,826 --> 00:12:44,509
- Yeah, I'm 50, you punk ass little bi--

283
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:45,342
- What?

284
00:12:49,037 --> 00:12:51,620
Yeah, we gotta get out of here.

285
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,607
Fuck, man, that fucking bitch, bro.

286
00:12:56,607 --> 00:12:57,942
- I wanna punch her in her face, man.

287
00:12:57,942 --> 00:12:58,940
- It's just fucked, though.

288
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,107
We'll go over to Bear liquor,
and you can pull that runner.

289
00:13:11,804 --> 00:13:14,804
(suspenseful music)

290
00:13:34,323 --> 00:13:35,823
- Hi Ryan.
- Hello.

291
00:13:37,186 --> 00:13:38,019
- 25.

292
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:56,010
Hey, what is this?

293
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,177
10.59, and 2.3

294
00:14:11,012 --> 00:14:12,826
All right, let's put it in, hey,

295
00:14:12,826 --> 00:14:15,243
hey, what have you got there?

296
00:14:16,158 --> 00:14:17,621
You're not just gonna steal from me.

297
00:14:17,621 --> 00:14:20,704
Nobody's gonna steal from me anymore.

298
00:14:23,004 --> 00:14:24,254
You understand?

299
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,194
(tires squealing)

300
00:14:27,194 --> 00:14:31,611
I'm getting tired of you
stupid kids stealing from me.

301
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:32,610
(gun cocks)

302
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:35,743
(gun shoots)

303
00:14:35,743 --> 00:14:38,243
- We just fucking got shot at.

304
00:14:39,657 --> 00:14:41,942
We just got, fuck, bro,
we just got shot at

305
00:14:41,942 --> 00:14:43,661
with a fucking gun, gimme that bottle.

306
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:45,328
That fucking bottle.

307
00:14:48,268 --> 00:14:50,361
Woo, holy shit, bro.

308
00:14:50,361 --> 00:14:52,284
We just got fucking shot at, bro.

309
00:14:52,284 --> 00:14:55,180
She shot at us with a fucking gun, dude.

310
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,336
She just shot at us with
a fucking gun, Dave,

311
00:14:57,336 --> 00:14:59,115
that was so cool, bro.

312
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:00,716
She just shot at us with a fucking gun,

313
00:15:00,716 --> 00:15:03,932
and check out our new fucking
shiny bottle of alcohol.

314
00:15:03,932 --> 00:15:06,015
That was so fucking cool.

315
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,360
- What's up, yeah.

316
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,661
- Listen, bro, we just
got fucking shot at, bro.

317
00:15:13,661 --> 00:15:16,028
- No way, who shot at
you, was it snowboarders?

318
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:17,932
- No, listen bro.
(laughing)

319
00:15:17,932 --> 00:15:19,913
Bear Liquor, yo, she fucking blasted us,

320
00:15:19,913 --> 00:15:21,355
it was so fucking cool.

321
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:22,355
- It's crazy, rippers,

322
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:24,201
come on, go inside, drink some beer.

323
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:27,557
- You wanna go?
- A bunch of hotties I picked

324
00:15:27,557 --> 00:15:28,793
up on the hill today.

325
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:31,460
- Tips.
- You can, just go scoop.

326
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:45,159
(beer can opening)

327
00:15:52,123 --> 00:15:54,893
- Yo, Dave, what's up, man?

328
00:15:54,893 --> 00:15:56,767
- Just hanging out, buddy.

329
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:58,428
- Right on.

330
00:15:58,428 --> 00:16:01,534
Hey, man, you gonna ride with us tomorrow?

331
00:16:01,534 --> 00:16:03,277
- No, I'm moving to Canada.

332
00:16:03,277 --> 00:16:04,545
- Oh, shit, Canada.

333
00:16:04,545 --> 00:16:06,752
- Canada?
- Canada.

334
00:16:06,752 --> 00:16:11,156
- Moving to fucking Canada,
in winter, beeyotch.

335
00:16:11,156 --> 00:16:12,375
- Where the fuck is that?

336
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,151
- Calgary, man.

337
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:15,416
- That's fucked up.

338
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,688
- Aw, it's cool, man, it's my parents

339
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:20,221
picking the nonsense city,

340
00:16:20,221 --> 00:16:22,998
there's a shitload of snow,
fucking goes on up there.

341
00:16:22,998 --> 00:16:24,530
- Yeah, whatever, that's cool.

342
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,898
Anyway, hey, man, we're
going up to Mammoth tomorrow.

343
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:29,720
We're staying at my teat's condo.

344
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,720
Hey, hottie.

345
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:34,538
- It's gonna be awesome, we're
getting dumped on right now.

346
00:16:34,538 --> 00:16:35,371
- Yeah.

347
00:16:36,487 --> 00:16:37,993
- Really?

348
00:16:37,993 --> 00:16:39,252
- Oh yeah.

349
00:16:39,252 --> 00:16:40,584
- All right, so check it out, right.

350
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,187
We find this big hit, and it's huge,

351
00:16:42,187 --> 00:16:43,431
and a 30 foot gap, huh?

352
00:16:43,431 --> 00:16:44,430
- Made it bigger, man.

353
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,115
- Right, so I look at Dave, and I'm like,

354
00:16:46,115 --> 00:16:47,268
are you gonna go first, or am I?

355
00:16:47,268 --> 00:16:49,382
He says no, fucking pussy, you found it,

356
00:16:49,382 --> 00:16:50,846
you go first, I'm like whatever, right?

357
00:16:50,846 --> 00:16:52,912
So I fully charge it, right,
hit it with all this speed,

358
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:55,395
and ollie as big as I
can off the edge of it,

359
00:16:55,395 --> 00:16:57,254
and I barely make it, I
mean, a couple more inches,

360
00:16:57,254 --> 00:16:59,263
and I'm totally fucked, right,

361
00:16:59,263 --> 00:17:00,724
so it's his turn to go now,

362
00:17:00,724 --> 00:17:03,127
I look up at him, and I don't
know what he was thinking.

363
00:17:03,127 --> 00:17:05,010
He fully charges, I guess
he's trying to make up

364
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,914
for being such a pussy,
or whatever, right,

365
00:17:06,914 --> 00:17:09,027
he goes at it with all this speed,

366
00:17:09,027 --> 00:17:10,789
and he tries to spin a 540,

367
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:12,067
- Oh, I fully pulled it, though, dude.

368
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:13,938
- Yeah, right, he lands perfectly,

369
00:17:13,938 --> 00:17:16,910
except he's like five feet
short of the gap, right?

370
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,650
He just, just, lands and
just bounces off, right?

371
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,669
He's like five feet in the air,

372
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:24,592
completely clears the gap,
falls right on his feet,

373
00:17:24,592 --> 00:17:26,914
and just keeps on flipping
down the mountain.

374
00:17:26,914 --> 00:17:28,624
- Seriously, that hurt so bad.

375
00:17:28,624 --> 00:17:30,922
- So he's tumbling, right, he gets up,

376
00:17:30,922 --> 00:17:33,347
his face is all bloody,
it's all fucked up and shit,

377
00:17:33,347 --> 00:17:35,590
right, and I look at him
and I'm like, bro, you okay?

378
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,646
And all he can say is, oh
man, I busted my noggin,

379
00:17:37,646 --> 00:17:39,619
I busted my noggin.

380
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:41,987
(laughing)

381
00:17:41,987 --> 00:17:45,671
- I remember just
looking at him, aw, dude,

382
00:17:45,671 --> 00:17:47,476
I'm slow, it's slow.

383
00:17:47,476 --> 00:17:49,515
- It's slow, right, so he
points his board straight,

384
00:17:49,515 --> 00:17:51,330
he goes down the mountain
about 60 miles per hour,

385
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,742
I mean, I gotta fully struggle

386
00:17:52,742 --> 00:17:54,036
just to keep up with this guy, right?

387
00:17:54,036 --> 00:17:57,014
He still beats me to the bottom
by like half a mile, right.

388
00:17:57,014 --> 00:17:58,645
So now we're sitting down there,

389
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:00,118
and we're unbinding and shit,

390
00:18:00,118 --> 00:18:01,617
and he looks up at me
and goes, where are we?

391
00:18:01,617 --> 00:18:03,730
And I'm like, dude, we're in Big Bear.

392
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,366
Now he kinda trips out,
he's like, Big Bear,

393
00:18:05,366 --> 00:18:06,838
how the fuck did we get there, right?

394
00:18:06,838 --> 00:18:08,920
I think he's fucking with me, right?

395
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,543
And then I look at him in
the eye and I can tell.

396
00:18:11,543 --> 00:18:13,285
I can tell that this guy's all messed up,

397
00:18:13,285 --> 00:18:14,481
and he's telling the truth,

398
00:18:14,481 --> 00:18:16,721
so I just gotta fucking freak out.

399
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,518
- I can remember my name
and everything else,

400
00:18:18,518 --> 00:18:21,145
I just I could not remember
driving up there that day,

401
00:18:21,145 --> 00:18:22,712
or riding at all.

402
00:18:22,712 --> 00:18:23,894
- [Girl] That's crazy.

403
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,927
- Actually it was kinda fun.

404
00:18:25,927 --> 00:18:27,635
I never had that feeling before.

405
00:18:27,635 --> 00:18:29,074
It was fun.

406
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,677
- Fun, fun, right, fun for you, maybe.

407
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:31,965
That's ridiculous.

408
00:18:31,965 --> 00:18:33,403
- Stop.

409
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,158
- Have you ever been out like that?

410
00:18:35,158 --> 00:18:36,609
- Well, I don't like going around

411
00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:38,084
banging up my head or anything like that,

412
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:39,883
but I broke my arm last
year in a couple of places,

413
00:18:39,883 --> 00:18:41,857
you know, and I had to deal.

414
00:18:41,857 --> 00:18:43,606
- [Girl] How'd it happen?

415
00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:47,750
- Mikey, you, oh, why
don't you and Clark Kent

416
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,542
stop hoarding all the girlies?

417
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:51,351
- Hey, Junior, it's not a
question of Mike and Dave

418
00:18:51,351 --> 00:18:54,744
hoarding us, rather it's us hoarding them.

419
00:18:54,744 --> 00:18:55,577
- Sassy.

420
00:18:59,342 --> 00:19:00,340
That sounds good.

421
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,414
Mikey, it's dumping up
at Mammoth, you gotta go.

422
00:19:02,414 --> 00:19:05,215
- Dude, I can't, I gotta get
this guy home by tonight,

423
00:19:05,215 --> 00:19:07,215
bro, tonight, that's it.

424
00:19:10,151 --> 00:19:13,568
♫ Oh, Canada, oh, Canada

425
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:18,846
- All right, it'll be awfully
sad if we can't go up.

426
00:19:18,846 --> 00:19:21,180
- You gotta go, it's your last weekend.

427
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,266
- Dude, it's gonna be the
last time we can ride together

428
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:25,035
for awhile, let's fucking go.

429
00:19:25,035 --> 00:19:26,590
Let's go.

430
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,771
- Uh, oh, that's nice,
we'll roll a few fatties

431
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:31,372
on the way up, we will
smoke fatties there,

432
00:19:31,372 --> 00:19:32,801
we will hook up with some hotties,

433
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:36,968
we will ride, fish, fish, fish,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

434
00:19:40,348 --> 00:19:42,879
- Sounds good man, but my dad
would kill me, though, man.

435
00:19:42,879 --> 00:19:44,830
- Fuck it, bro, who cares about your dad?

436
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,290
It's your last weekend, man, this is it.

437
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,623
This is it, bro.

438
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,667
- All right, yeah, fuck it, let's do it.

439
00:19:57,667 --> 00:19:58,901
(cheering)

440
00:19:58,901 --> 00:19:59,818
- Aw, yeah.

441
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,583
(giggling)

442
00:20:10,952 --> 00:20:13,551
So, Dave, why don't you find the bong

443
00:20:13,551 --> 00:20:15,561
and load up a fat bowl for these beautiful

444
00:20:15,561 --> 00:20:17,019
young ladies, all right?

445
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:18,019
- All right.

446
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,362
- All right, Dave.

447
00:20:20,362 --> 00:20:21,827
- But where's it at, man?

448
00:20:21,827 --> 00:20:23,894
- Bro, I don't know, that's why
I asked you to find it, huh?

449
00:20:23,894 --> 00:20:24,830
- Hey.

450
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,663
(laughing)

451
00:20:25,663 --> 00:20:27,118
- So listen, you guys like boarding, huh?

452
00:20:27,118 --> 00:20:28,813
- Yeah, it's pretty dope.

453
00:20:28,813 --> 00:20:29,820
- Uh-huh.

454
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,843
- You, you are good, you are good.

455
00:20:31,843 --> 00:20:33,363
(laughing)

456
00:20:33,363 --> 00:20:35,570
- I've been riding since last year.

457
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,356
- Seriously, most girls,
they ride kinda whack,

458
00:20:38,356 --> 00:20:40,017
but I like your style, you know,

459
00:20:40,017 --> 00:20:41,363
you just go bombing the runs, you know,

460
00:20:41,363 --> 00:20:42,706
hitting the jones and stuff, I don't know.

461
00:20:42,706 --> 00:20:44,637
You know, kinda wild.

462
00:20:44,637 --> 00:20:45,891
- I'm trying to get better.

463
00:20:45,891 --> 00:20:47,551
- Listen, you're good
now, though, seriously.

464
00:20:47,551 --> 00:20:50,115
Alls you need to do though,
is ride with a couple guys

465
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,459
like me and Dave over here,
and you'll start progressing

466
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,760
really fast, seriously.

467
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,760
- Really.

468
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,781
- I guarantee that.

469
00:20:56,781 --> 00:20:58,439
- Well, we'll just have
to go riding, won't we?

470
00:20:58,439 --> 00:20:59,742
- [Mike] Oh, absolutely, we've gotta try.

471
00:20:59,742 --> 00:21:00,747
(laughing)

472
00:21:00,747 --> 00:21:01,749
- You need some help?

473
00:21:01,749 --> 00:21:03,749
- I have found the bong.

474
00:21:04,755 --> 00:21:06,418
- Sweet.
- Aw, yeah.

475
00:21:06,418 --> 00:21:08,333
- [Mike] Why don't you
load that up, stinky, huh?

476
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,294
- All right, gimme a second.
- Get it going.

477
00:21:11,294 --> 00:21:12,304
(laughing)

478
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:13,379
- So are you guys excited about Mammoth?

479
00:21:13,379 --> 00:21:14,868
- [Mike] Oh my god, it's gonna be so dope.

480
00:21:14,868 --> 00:21:16,437
- Yeah, my friend Lucy's going up there

481
00:21:16,437 --> 00:21:18,178
with her parents, I wish I could go.

482
00:21:18,178 --> 00:21:20,788
- Why can't you go, what's the problem?

483
00:21:20,788 --> 00:21:22,114
- [Girl] Her mom won't let her.

484
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,113
(laughing)

485
00:21:23,113 --> 00:21:24,131
- [Mike] Get outta here, seriously?

486
00:21:24,131 --> 00:21:25,168
- Mm-mm.
- That's too bad.

487
00:21:25,168 --> 00:21:27,139
- You got a light in there?

488
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:29,986
- Yeah, it's right here,
bro, but pass that bong over.

489
00:21:29,986 --> 00:21:31,762
I'm taking it.

490
00:21:31,762 --> 00:21:34,374
- Had me fucking loadin' it,
and now you're green's rent?

491
00:21:34,374 --> 00:21:36,006
- He's a whiny little bitch, right?

492
00:21:36,006 --> 00:21:37,005
(laughing)

493
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:38,287
No, he's not a whiny little bitch.

494
00:21:38,287 --> 00:21:41,236
Easy there, bro, don't
knock it over, go ahead.

495
00:21:41,236 --> 00:21:44,819
Come on, big one, now,
a big one for daddy.

He's out.

(laughing)

500
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,041
- No way.

501
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:19,410
- Ooh.

502
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,748

503
00:22:20,748 --> 00:22:24,915

00:23:20,504 --> 00:23:23,964
What happens if the Motel 6 is filled?

525
00:23:23,964 --> 00:23:26,972
- We can stay at that
fucker's house, dude.

526
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:30,488
The guy who's got the parents
with the condo up there?

527
00:23:30,488 --> 00:23:31,821
Gavin McKitchee.

528
00:23:33,263 --> 00:23:35,206
- Fuck, man, I don't know those people.

529
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:36,744
- Dude, you know who I'm
fucking talking about.

530
00:23:36,744 --> 00:23:38,967
The fucker who always wears
the messed up beanies,

531
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:42,552
rides with the dude who waves
his arms when he speaks.

532
00:23:42,552 --> 00:23:45,341
- No, no, Dave, I don't know
who you're talking about, man.

533
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,867
- The beanie guy's Andre, and
the other friend's Cats man.

534
00:23:47,867 --> 00:23:50,566
- Yeah, we'll stay with those goons, man.

535
00:23:50,566 --> 00:23:54,316
- I just don't know who
you're talking about.

536
00:23:56,982 --> 00:23:59,065
- Pass me that dough boy.

537
00:24:06,224 --> 00:24:08,793
This looks like a good
place to get some drugs.

538
00:24:08,793 --> 00:24:10,314
- Ooh wee.

539
00:24:10,314 --> 00:24:13,147
Hey, boys, find yourselves a seat.

540
00:24:15,712 --> 00:24:17,060
- All right.

541
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,406
Gentlemen, super booth?

542
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:19,489
- Definitely.

543
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,033
Dude, I don't wanna wait for
them to clean this shit up.

544
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:32,582
Let's go sit over here.

545
00:24:32,582 --> 00:24:33,665
I'm starving.

546
00:24:36,386 --> 00:24:39,792
Man, I'm so fucking hung over, dude.

547
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:41,170
- Tell me about it, I'm still drunk.

548
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,263
- What do you know, I feel fine.

549
00:24:43,263 --> 00:24:45,713
- That's 'cause you passed out
early last night, you pussy.

550
00:24:45,713 --> 00:24:47,745
(laughing)

551
00:24:47,745 --> 00:24:51,309
- Whatever, dude, at least I
got no pain right now, huh?

552
00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:54,606
- Yeah, you didn't get laid
last night, either, did you?

553
00:24:54,606 --> 00:24:56,046
- All righty.

554
00:24:56,046 --> 00:24:58,353
What can I get you boys?

555
00:24:58,353 --> 00:24:59,793
- Ah, you cute little teddy bear.

556
00:24:59,793 --> 00:25:02,034
What you got that's good in
that kitchen of yours, honey?

557
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:04,354
- Everything is fine to eat in my kitchen.

558
00:25:04,354 --> 00:25:07,168
- All right, baby, I mean,
what you got that's good?

559
00:25:07,168 --> 00:25:11,650
- I am no baby, but uh, the
chicken fried steak is good.

560
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:15,733
- Okay, well, I'll have
that and some tater tots,

561
00:25:17,396 --> 00:25:20,146
and a large milkshake, chocolate.

562

00:25:33,151 --> 00:25:36,484
a vanilla milkshake, and banana pudding.

566
00:25:37,732 --> 00:25:41,104
- Ooh wee, all right, hungry
little bugger, ain't you?

567
00:25:41,104 --> 00:25:43,937
- I need to get my energy up
to do some big dump and pump

568
00:25:43,937 --> 00:25:45,520
pom daddy airs, ah.

569

- Okay.

576
00:26:06,113 --> 00:26:07,508
- Is there a restroom?

577
00:26:07,508 --> 00:26:09,364

599
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,915

600
00:27:18,915 --> 00:27:20,801

00:27:20,801 --> 00:27:21,634

00:27:26,082 --> 00:27:28,000
We've gotta leave for Canada today.

00:28:36,863 --> 00:28:38,282
wipe the shit from your eyes,
and take a good look around.

We don't like your kind

647
00:29:06,269 --> 00:29:07,760
- Aw, Marge, this ain't
got nothing to do with you.

648
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,523
- This here has everything to do with me.

00:29:10,523 --> 00:29:11,788
It's my place.

650
00:29:11,788 --> 00:29:13,180
- Aw, come on, Marge, we
were just teasing 'em.

651
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,744
It's all good, all right?

652
00:29:15,744 --> 00:29:16,893
- Well, be nice.

653
00:29:16,893 --> 00:29:18,879
They're paying customers.

654
00:29:18,879 --> 00:29:19,712

655
00:29:25,034 --> 00:29:27,495
Yeah, you boys heard Margie,

(laughing)

659
00:29:39,161 --> 00:29:41,661
- [Jimmy] Big Bob, I love you.

660
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,214
Chocolate's never my favorite.

661
00:29:46,073 --> 00:29:47,443
- [Bob] Mine neither.

662
00:29:47,443 --> 00:29:49,064
- Fucking hick assholes.

663
00:29:49,064 --> 00:29:50,322
- [Bob] Oh, what you gonna do, little boy?

664
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:52,307
- You know what, dude, I
ain't gonna do anything.

665
00:29:52,307 --> 00:29:54,278
Just a couple of fucking hick jerkoffs.

666
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:57,655
Come on, Junior, let's
get the fuck outta here.

667
00:29:57,655 --> 00:29:59,468
(laughing)

668
00:29:59,468 --> 00:30:01,046
- Have a good day, ladies.

669
00:30:01,046 --> 00:30:02,359
Aw, mommy.

670
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:03,708
- Come on, Junior.

671
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:04,916
- Might as well cancel that order, Marge,

672
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:07,416
dickheads here chased us away.

673
00:30:10,047 --> 00:30:11,440
- Big Bob, I love you.

674
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,940
- I love you, too.

675
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:17,338
- What'd you guys do in there, man?

676
00:30:17,338 --> 00:30:18,712
- No, we didn't do anything, punk.

677
00:30:18,712 --> 00:30:21,401
- Bullshit, if you didn't do anything,

678
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:22,458
they wouldn't have chased us out.

679
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:23,756
- No, man, we, they really started messing

680
00:30:23,756 --> 00:30:25,019
with us for doing nothing.

681
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:26,312
Bitches.

682
00:30:26,312 --> 00:30:28,014
- What the hell happened in there.

683
00:30:28,014 --> 00:30:30,175
- Dude, it was just a
couple of hick assholes,

684
00:30:30,175 --> 00:30:33,081
being typical, they were
fucking with us for no reason.

685
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,355
Now, just leave it alone.

686
00:30:35,355 --> 00:30:37,237
- This always happens to us.

687
00:30:37,237 --> 00:30:38,920
- Least you're not me.

688
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,674
- You got that right, old man.

689
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:42,282
- Fuck you, you have no idea.

690
00:30:42,282 --> 00:30:44,539
So much shit happens to me,

691
00:30:44,539 --> 00:30:45,723
since I was born, shit be happening.

692
00:30:45,723 --> 00:30:47,821
- Whatever, fighting wasn't even invented

693
00:30:47,821 --> 00:30:49,288
when you were born.

694
00:30:49,288 --> 00:30:50,925
- Dude, you have no idea how many guys

695
00:30:50,925 --> 00:30:53,015
I had to go through to
get all the chickies,

696
00:30:53,015 --> 00:30:54,207
I did it, too.

697
00:30:54,207 --> 00:30:55,995
- Hey, Junior, if you're
such a tough guy, bro,

698
00:30:55,995 --> 00:30:58,365
why didn't you do anything back
there with those hicks, bro?

699
00:30:58,365 --> 00:30:59,737
- 'Cause those guys don't work.

700
00:30:59,737 --> 00:31:02,047
- Yeah, right, you were fucking scared.

701
00:31:02,047 --> 00:31:04,010
- Please, you looked pretty
scared to me, tough guy.

702
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,795
- Dude, I was about to fuck
those guys up, seriously.

703
00:31:05,795 --> 00:31:07,562
If I wasn't so fucking hung over,

704
00:31:07,562 --> 00:31:09,757
I would've been fucking both those dudes.

705
00:31:09,757 --> 00:31:10,798
- Boom.

706
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:11,881
- Yeah, sure.

707
00:31:12,763 --> 00:31:14,795
- You know I know kung fu, bro,

708
00:31:14,795 --> 00:31:16,444
you know I would've fucked those guys up.

709
00:31:16,444 --> 00:31:19,111
- Hey, we don't like your kind.

710
00:31:23,802 --> 00:31:26,052
(grunting)

711
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:37,743
(glass breaking)

712
00:31:59,999 --> 00:32:03,738
- Next time, you will not be so lucky.

713
00:32:03,738 --> 00:32:04,973
Woo ah.

714
00:32:04,973 --> 00:32:06,525
(laughing)

715
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:07,528
- Yeah.

716
00:32:07,528 --> 00:32:08,712
Well, you got a pretty good imagination,

717
00:32:08,712 --> 00:32:09,943
but if we were gonna get
out of that situation,

718
00:32:09,943 --> 00:32:12,443
it woulda gone down like this.

719
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:15,723
(laughing)

720
00:32:15,723 --> 00:32:16,967
- Yeah, baby, I love that.

721
00:32:16,967 --> 00:32:17,800
Woohoo.

722
00:32:26,108 --> 00:32:27,500
- Cut me some bass.

723
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,250
Say hello to Laverne and Shirley.

724
00:32:35,967 --> 00:32:38,124
Dance, mother fucker.

725
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:40,381
(gun shoots)

726
00:32:40,381 --> 00:32:43,298
Can't you feel the beat, white boy?

727
00:32:44,433 --> 00:32:46,383
- Oh my god, what's going on in here?

728
00:32:46,383 --> 00:32:49,779
- These boys taking their hardest dough.

729
00:32:49,779 --> 00:32:54,081
I'll be having you, bread with
a side of black-eyed peas,

730
00:32:54,081 --> 00:32:57,668
collard greens, and slice
of sweet potato pie.

731
00:32:57,668 --> 00:32:59,668
Where you goin', cowboy?

732
00:33:00,837 --> 00:33:04,649
- What, you gonna shoot an unarmed man?

733
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,732
- Six to one.

734
00:33:07,188 --> 00:33:08,021
- Oh.

735
00:33:13,388 --> 00:33:15,805
(gun shoots)

736
00:33:22,862 --> 00:33:23,860
- Eh.

737
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,519
(gun shoots)

738
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,852
(grunting)

739
00:33:32,984 --> 00:33:35,317
- Oh my god, you killed him.

740
00:33:36,945 --> 00:33:38,164
- He deserved it.

741
00:33:38,164 --> 00:33:39,939
- You're right, they've been terrorizing

742
00:33:39,939 --> 00:33:41,856
my customers for years.

743
00:33:42,705 --> 00:33:44,788
How can I ever repay you?

744
00:33:47,347 --> 00:33:48,346
- You already did.

745
00:33:48,346 --> 00:33:49,352
This is all the thanks I need.

746
00:33:49,352 --> 00:33:50,969
- Uh.

747
00:33:50,969 --> 00:33:51,802
Mm.

748
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:58,643
Oh my god, we ran out of gas.

749
00:33:58,643 --> 00:34:01,732
- Oh, no, man, we were gonna get it

750
00:34:01,732 --> 00:34:03,157
in that town back there, dude.

751
00:34:03,157 --> 00:34:04,240
- What's going on?

752
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,012
- Dude, our fucking car is
riding on the red line of E,

753
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:08,291
that's what's wrong, bro.

754
00:34:08,291 --> 00:34:09,290
- Oh, gas?

755
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,997
- Nada, dude, seriously,
there's not another town

756
00:34:10,997 --> 00:34:12,306
for like 30 miles.

757
00:34:12,306 --> 00:34:14,291
- Oh, man, those hicks
really fucked with our day.

758
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:16,883
- Dude, I seriously don't
have any money, man,

759
00:34:16,883 --> 00:34:18,774
I was gonna use my mom's credit card.

760
00:34:18,774 --> 00:34:22,650
- I got a couple bucks, I think, I hope.

761
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:23,649
(laughing)

762
00:34:23,649 --> 00:34:25,367
Oh, I have a couple bucks for real.

763
00:34:25,367 --> 00:34:27,907
I spent all my money
on beer for last night.

764
00:34:27,907 --> 00:34:29,976
- How 'bout you, Mike?

765
00:34:29,976 --> 00:34:31,470
- Dude, you know me, alls
I got is fucking 54 cents

766
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,803
and an ATM card.

767
00:34:34,132 --> 00:34:35,317
- Shit.

768
00:34:35,317 --> 00:34:37,465
- All right, well,
first things first, man,

769
00:34:37,465 --> 00:34:39,078
can we even make it to
the next gas station?

770
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:40,808
- I don't know, bro, you
know this fucking beast

771
00:34:40,808 --> 00:34:42,695
eats so much gas.

772
00:34:42,695 --> 00:34:43,927
- Even if we make it to the next station,

773
00:34:43,927 --> 00:34:44,929
we are still screwed.

774
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:46,660
We have $2.54.

775
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:49,063
- Yeah, well, they gotta let
us use our ATM cards, right?

776
00:34:49,063 --> 00:34:51,396
- We are in the fucking
back woods, buddy, okay?

777
00:34:51,396 --> 00:34:54,236
We cannot underestimate how
screwy these hicks can be.

778
00:34:54,236 --> 00:34:55,911
- All right, bro, first things first,

779
00:34:55,911 --> 00:34:57,742
we gotta find a fucking gas station,

780
00:34:57,742 --> 00:35:00,313
and hope that our cash
gets us to fucking Bishop,

781
00:35:00,313 --> 00:35:04,230
where they'll have a
couple banks, bro, period.

782
00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:07,879
- [David] Dude, if we don't
find a gas station soon,

783
00:35:07,879 --> 00:35:09,046
we're screwed.

784
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:12,039
- Yo, what is that right
there, is that a gas station?

785
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:14,164
That's a gas station
right over there, right?

786
00:35:14,164 --> 00:35:16,114
- Dude, I don't know what
the fuck that is, man.

787
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,815
- What the fuck would
they be doing out here?

788
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:19,823
- Well, they got a pump there,

789
00:35:19,823 --> 00:35:21,990
so I'm gonna pull in, bro.

790
00:35:27,614 --> 00:35:28,781
Hang on, boys.

791
00:35:43,413 --> 00:35:45,072
Hey, man, you take ATM cards?

792
00:35:45,072 --> 00:35:46,963
- Ah, a 61 sedan DeVille.

793
00:35:46,963 --> 00:35:49,103
- Yeah, it sure is, bro.

794
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:52,911
- Pretty sweet, what you got
in here, the 390 or the 54?

795
00:35:52,911 --> 00:35:55,381
- Yeah, it's a 390,
listen, you take ATM cards?

796
00:35:55,381 --> 00:35:57,499
- You mean the bank cash cards?

797
00:35:57,499 --> 00:35:58,504
- Yeah.

798
00:35:58,504 --> 00:35:59,506
- No.

799
00:35:59,506 --> 00:36:01,771
- Oh, man, we're fucked, dude.

800
00:36:01,771 --> 00:36:03,629
- Listen, how far to the next town

801
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:07,907
that's got a bank machine,
man, we're jammed.

802
00:36:07,907 --> 00:36:09,817
- 'Bout 40 miles, I guess.

803
00:36:09,817 --> 00:36:11,370
- Dude, alls we have is $2.54, you guys,

804
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,661
that ain't gonna get us there.

805
00:36:12,661 --> 00:36:14,621
- Shit, this day sucks, man,
first the diner and now this.

806
00:36:14,621 --> 00:36:16,934
- Man, we'll never get
a chance to ride today.

807
00:36:16,934 --> 00:36:18,570
- You guys snowboarders?

808
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:19,403
- Yeah.

809
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:22,681
- I used to ride.

810
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:23,685
- Why did you quit?

811
00:36:23,685 --> 00:36:27,146
- Well, I got my girlfriend pregnant,

812
00:36:27,146 --> 00:36:30,808
so I had to marry her, and
I didn't have any money,

813
00:36:30,808 --> 00:36:32,234
'cause all I used to do is snowboard,

814
00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:33,594
just like you guys.

815
00:36:33,594 --> 00:36:36,427
And, you know, I had to get a job,

816
00:36:37,772 --> 00:36:39,405
so her old man gave me this place.

817
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,474
- Dude, listen, you gotta fucking

818
00:36:40,474 --> 00:36:42,174
help out me and my buddy here, all right?

819
00:36:42,174 --> 00:36:45,181
I mean, I'm, it's the last
time we're gonna be able

820
00:36:45,181 --> 00:36:46,317
to ride together for a long time.

821
00:36:46,317 --> 00:36:47,654
He's moving away, he's
going to fucking Canada,

822
00:36:47,654 --> 00:36:49,738
and this is our last
weekend, bro, we're stuck.

823
00:36:49,738 --> 00:36:51,610
We need your help, man.

824
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,925
- We'll pay you on the way back.

825
00:36:52,925 --> 00:36:53,923
(laughing)

826
00:36:53,923 --> 00:36:54,987
- How can I trust you?

827
00:36:54,987 --> 00:36:56,489
I used to be a little punk, just like you.

828
00:36:56,489 --> 00:36:57,754
(laughing)

829
00:36:57,754 --> 00:37:00,121
- Dude, then you should
know how we feel, man.

830
00:37:00,121 --> 00:37:02,073
You know, this is important to us.

831
00:37:02,073 --> 00:37:04,151
It's just gonna be a matter of time

832
00:37:04,151 --> 00:37:06,857
before we're stuck, you
know, and we end up like you.

833
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:09,546
- I'd do anything to trade
places with you guys.

834
00:37:09,546 --> 00:37:11,129
- Dude, what, and be stuck out here

835
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:12,134
in the middle of nowhere,

836
00:37:12,134 --> 00:37:15,805
and now gas, no money, man,
we're up shit's creek, dude.

837
00:37:15,805 --> 00:37:18,536
- No, man, just not having
to worry about anything,

838
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:20,487
but just having a good time.

839
00:37:20,487 --> 00:37:21,770
- Bro, you gotta help us out.

840
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:22,772
Just think about it.

841
00:37:22,772 --> 00:37:24,121
You know what it's like,
you have a kid, bro,

842
00:37:24,121 --> 00:37:25,674
think about your kid, he's
gonna be shredding up one day,

843
00:37:25,674 --> 00:37:27,673
he's gonna wanna go snowboarding.

844
00:37:27,673 --> 00:37:29,066
That's what we are, we're out here,

845
00:37:29,066 --> 00:37:30,071
we wanna go snowboarding,

846
00:37:30,071 --> 00:37:31,400
dude, we're stuck, we just need,

847
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,269
we need a little bit of
money, bro, just help us out.

848
00:37:33,269 --> 00:37:37,577
- All right, guys, I'll
fill this beast up.

849
00:37:37,577 --> 00:37:38,577
- Yee, nice.

850
00:37:39,771 --> 00:37:43,104
- Nice, you're the man, bro, I like you.

851
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,492
- Hey, you smoke weed?

852
00:37:45,492 --> 00:37:46,851
- Yeah, I smoke weed.

853
00:37:46,851 --> 00:37:49,834
- How 'bout we give you a
fatty of our killer endo.

854
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,251
- That'd be cool.

855
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:07,223
- Dude, it's so fucking
dope out here, you guys.

856
00:38:07,223 --> 00:38:08,979
Look at all the fucking powder, man.

857
00:38:08,979 --> 00:38:10,790
- Dude, dude, I'm gonna
find me the biggest

858
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:13,205
fucking kicker and do a back flip, man.

859
00:38:13,205 --> 00:38:14,326
- This place is so big, man.

860
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:16,200
What happens if I lose you guys?

861
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,300
- Junior, dude, we'll
wait for you, all right?

862
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,098
- Yeah, dude, if you
fucking lag at all, bro,

863
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:23,178
just meet us at warmer
hut two at four o'clock.

864
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:25,095
You know where that is.

865
00:38:26,422 --> 00:38:27,343
- Let's roast 'em all.

866
00:38:27,343 --> 00:38:28,926
- Shit, yeah, dude.

867
00:38:31,286 --> 00:38:32,220
- Woo.

868
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:36,455
Wonder what the park's
like here, dude, huh?

869
00:38:36,455 --> 00:38:38,012
- Dude, fuck that park, bro,

870
00:38:38,012 --> 00:38:40,554
I wanna ride all this
powder in the back country.

871
00:38:40,554 --> 00:38:43,630
- Oh, no, no, I do not wanna
get stuck back there, man.

872
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:46,929
- Oh, no, no, I do not
wanna get stuck back there.

873
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:49,967
Junior, come on, dude, Junior.

874
00:38:49,967 --> 00:38:52,268
If you want, I'll show you
where the bunny trail is.

875
00:38:52,268 --> 00:38:53,914
I know you like it, and
I know you can handle it.

876
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,482
- Yeah, Junior, Dave
loves that fucking run,

877
00:38:55,482 --> 00:38:57,448
it's his favorite fucking run, man.

878
00:38:57,448 --> 00:38:58,987
He knows exactly where it is, bro.

879
00:38:58,987 --> 00:39:00,838
No, listen, listen,
listen, you don't have,

880
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,253
you don't have to explain to me, man,

881
00:39:02,253 --> 00:39:03,671
it's all right, it's all right.

882
00:39:03,671 --> 00:39:05,030
- Shut up, little boy,
or you're gonna know

883
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,330
what being scared's all about.

884
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:08,172
- Ooh, I better be
quiet or the grandfather

885
00:39:08,172 --> 00:39:11,255
of snowboarding is gonna kick my ass.

886
00:39:14,817 --> 00:39:18,650
- Come on, dude, let's
fucking ride, you know?

887
00:39:24,115 --> 00:39:28,115
♫ Destiny, cooling like gravity

888
00:39:33,753 --> 00:39:37,170
♫ Leaving my hands empty

889
00:39:40,394 --> 00:39:44,227
♫ You have grown away from me

890
00:39:48,042 --> 00:39:51,709
♫ Sliding away from reality

891
00:39:58,761 --> 00:40:02,011
♫ Playing with destiny

892
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:06,981
♫ Riding on fast

893
00:40:06,981 --> 00:40:10,064
♫ Away from the past

894
00:40:12,217 --> 00:40:16,384
♫ Doubting words that don't mean a thing

895
00:40:22,793 --> 00:40:25,793
♫ Trying to survive

896
00:40:27,983 --> 00:40:31,942
♫ I raced down the slopes

897
00:40:31,942 --> 00:40:34,109
♫ Of life

898
00:40:35,471 --> 00:40:37,638
♫ Destiny

899
00:42:30,709 --> 00:42:32,801
- I've never seen anyone
get worked that hard.

900
00:42:32,801 --> 00:42:35,412
But you must've flipped over
like five or six times, bro.

901
00:42:35,412 --> 00:42:37,476
- Dude, at least I have
the edge to make breakfast.

902
00:42:37,476 --> 00:42:39,475
- Look, fuck that, at
least I'm smart enough

903
00:42:39,475 --> 00:42:42,275
not to get worked by some
stupid kicker out there.

904
00:42:42,275 --> 00:42:44,527
That shit was funnier than
an Adam Sandler movie, bro.

905
00:42:44,527 --> 00:42:45,758
- Whatever, man.

906
00:42:45,758 --> 00:42:48,579
Dude, you think Junior's gonna be boned

907
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:49,729
about riding all day by himself?

908
00:42:49,729 --> 00:42:50,887
- Fuck that, dude, he's a big boy,

909
00:42:50,887 --> 00:42:52,051
he can take care of himself.

910
00:42:52,051 --> 00:42:53,092
Let's go.

911
00:42:53,092 --> 00:42:54,640
- Yeah, I just think it'd
suck if I rode Mammoth

912
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,132
all day by myself.

913
00:42:56,132 --> 00:42:57,607
- Dave, I came here to fucking ride, dude,

914
00:42:57,607 --> 00:42:59,303
not to fucking babysit Junior, man.

915
00:42:59,303 --> 00:43:02,020
- Still, man, I wouldn't
want to ride this whole

916
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,020
mountain by myself, man.

917
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,836
- [Junior] Seriously, after I get done

918
00:43:09,836 --> 00:43:12,043
questioning my old lady,

919
00:43:12,043 --> 00:43:13,703
I go in to get myself a beer,

920
00:43:13,703 --> 00:43:15,944
and standing there, in
this sexy nightgown,

921
00:43:15,944 --> 00:43:17,276
is her best friend right?

922
00:43:17,276 --> 00:43:18,278
- Oh.

923
00:43:18,278 --> 00:43:19,936
- She's looking really good,

924
00:43:19,936 --> 00:43:21,629
so I'm just chilling, I'm watching her.

925
00:43:21,629 --> 00:43:24,013
I mean, she turns
around, she turns around,

926
00:43:24,013 --> 00:43:27,553
and she is all nipples
holding a cold beer, dude.

927
00:43:27,553 --> 00:43:29,596
- Yeah, dog, I love hot nipples.

928
00:43:29,596 --> 00:43:30,665
- Oh yeah.

929
00:43:30,665 --> 00:43:32,999
She gives me this sexy little smile,

930
00:43:32,999 --> 00:43:35,240
she's like, would you like a beer?

931
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,405
Ooh, and I say, that's
what I came in here for,

932
00:43:37,405 --> 00:43:39,484
and she goes, is that
all you came in here for?

933
00:43:39,484 --> 00:43:41,900
And then I go, what did you have in mind,

934
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,574
and I swear to god, the bitch says,

935
00:43:44,574 --> 00:43:46,844
you fucking me right here on the counter.

936
00:43:46,844 --> 00:43:49,645
(laughing)

937
00:43:49,645 --> 00:43:51,645
My pants dropped faster than my mouth.

938
00:43:51,645 --> 00:43:53,892
- That's bullshit, man,
that shit never happened.

939
00:43:53,892 --> 00:43:55,997
- Yo, that shit did happen,
kid, I'm telling you.

940
00:43:55,997 --> 00:44:00,164
- Yo, what up, Junior, I see
you made it down in one piece.

941
00:44:01,432 --> 00:44:03,162
- You guys missed out.

942
00:44:03,162 --> 00:44:04,540
The way I took was nice.

943
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,482
- Get back to the story.

944
00:44:06,482 --> 00:44:08,073
You boned your girl and
her best friend one night,

945
00:44:08,073 --> 00:44:09,534
is that it?

946
00:44:09,534 --> 00:44:11,693
- [Junior] No, no, it gets better.

947
00:44:11,693 --> 00:44:13,100
- Yo, how much better can it get?

948
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:17,372
- So I'm done boning her
on the kitchen floor,

949
00:44:17,372 --> 00:44:19,820
I go back into my bedroom
to get into bed with my old,

950
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,981
do I have some shit still on my nose?

951
00:44:21,981 --> 00:44:24,995
(laughing)

952
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:28,131
Okay, I get back into bed,
I think I'm getting into bed

953
00:44:28,131 --> 00:44:30,564
with my old lady, but I
was so faded I ended up

954
00:44:30,564 --> 00:44:31,840
in her sister's room.

955
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,625
- No fucking way.

956
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:36,928
- I don't know if I was too drunk

957
00:44:36,928 --> 00:44:38,717
or fucking confused from fucking so much,

958
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:41,724
but I laid back just to pass out, man

959
00:44:41,724 --> 00:44:43,791
and psycho bitch jumps me.

960
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:45,808
I'm thinking, what's up, my,

961
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:48,465
my old lady wants to
fuck twice in one night?

962
00:44:48,465 --> 00:44:50,652
Until I heard the voice.

963
00:44:50,652 --> 00:44:51,776
(laughing)

964
00:44:51,776 --> 00:44:54,095
I won't tell if you don't tell.

965
00:44:54,095 --> 00:44:56,722
Yeah, I knew I was in
for round three, baby.

966
00:44:56,722 --> 00:44:58,477
(cheering)

967
00:44:58,477 --> 00:44:59,476
- Damn, I love this story, that's hot.

968
00:44:59,476 --> 00:45:02,176
- Did you get busted by any of them?

969
00:45:02,176 --> 00:45:03,999
- That's the beauty of the whole story,

970
00:45:03,999 --> 00:45:05,536
I got off scott free.

971
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,533
- Three cooking cooters
in one night, that's sick.

972
00:45:07,533 --> 00:45:08,537
(laughing)

973
00:45:08,537 --> 00:45:10,512
- I'm no player, I just crush a lot.

974
00:45:10,512 --> 00:45:11,345
- Oh.

975
00:45:13,964 --> 00:45:15,776
- You loosen up the park today, or what?

976
00:45:15,776 --> 00:45:17,038
- Nah, dude, we were
hitting up that fresh powder

977
00:45:17,038 --> 00:45:19,953
in the back country, dude, you know.

978
00:45:19,953 --> 00:45:21,627
- Powder hounds, dude, you
got to got to the park,

979
00:45:21,627 --> 00:45:23,868
dude, it's going on.

980
00:45:23,868 --> 00:45:24,909
- Yo, man, let's get some quickies

981
00:45:24,909 --> 00:45:28,492
and then get back up
on that mountain, man.

982
00:45:30,277 --> 00:45:32,610
(rap music)

983
00:45:40,014 --> 00:45:42,549
♫ It's like oh, here
comes another one, brother

984
00:45:42,549 --> 00:45:44,557
♫ Get down with the peace sound

985
00:45:44,557 --> 00:45:45,562
♫ When we smother

986
00:45:45,562 --> 00:45:47,344
♫ You see the stereo wide cover

987
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:49,745
♫ Tracks to build the whacks like ever

988
00:45:49,745 --> 00:45:50,833
♫ Cool it that place we tracking

989
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:52,572
♫ I got the song you be hackin'

990
00:45:52,572 --> 00:45:53,952
♫ Why not get my good new pimp

991
00:45:53,952 --> 00:45:54,910
♫ Hanging off my lip

992
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:56,549
♫ They say, hey, yo, don't call me

993
00:45:56,549 --> 00:45:57,904
♫ You what's up with the slang

994
00:45:57,904 --> 00:45:58,822
♫ Yeah, what you mean

995
00:45:58,822 --> 00:45:59,655
♫ That's some sugar way

996
00:45:59,655 --> 00:46:00,488
♫ From back in the day

997
00:46:00,488 --> 00:46:01,321
♫ Just like the beat of rap

998
00:46:01,321 --> 00:46:02,154
♫ Over who are older than me

999
00:46:02,154 --> 00:46:02,987
♫ Just the style of the beat

1000
00:46:02,987 --> 00:46:04,862
♫ But the vibe is still free

1001
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:06,428
♫ Take it through oh grace

1002
00:46:06,428 --> 00:46:07,546
♫ To just creating the sound

1003
00:46:07,546 --> 00:46:08,978
♫ Scribble with the rhyme

1004
00:46:08,978 --> 00:46:10,344
♫ Going to put the kid down

1005
00:46:10,344 --> 00:46:11,455
♫ To the bottom of the barrel

1006
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,920
♫ Can't funk like Joe Farrell

1007
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,033
♫ That part is why I go this

1008
00:46:14,033 --> 00:46:15,309
♫ When you drop beats

1009
00:46:15,309 --> 00:46:16,486
♫ We're all about loose deeps

1010
00:46:16,486 --> 00:46:17,380
♫ In the streets

1011
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,213
♫ With group seats

1012
00:46:18,213 --> 00:46:19,046
♫ Unaffordable here

1013
00:46:19,046 --> 00:46:20,280
♫ Pop a loan up at the dollar

1014
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,113
♫ With some records we bought

1015
00:46:21,113 --> 00:46:22,704
♫ At the local thrift shop

1016
00:46:22,704 --> 00:46:23,696
♫ Mom and pop store

1017
00:46:23,696 --> 00:46:25,433
♫ Marauding still it's 70s rock

1018
00:46:25,433 --> 00:46:26,776
♫ And a doozy 45 of brothers

1019
00:46:26,776 --> 00:46:27,995
♫ Do what they do

1020
00:46:27,995 --> 00:46:29,186
♫ We traveling the globe now

1021
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:30,214
♫ Trying to take it back to 92

1022
00:46:30,214 --> 00:46:31,612
♫ Used to it

1023

♫ The way we do what we do

1024
00:46:32,993 --> 00:46:34,188
♫ Make the seas more quick

1025
00:46:34,188 --> 00:46:35,537
♫ When you stick with your crew

1026
00:46:35,537 --> 00:46:36,655
♫ Don't be trying to end the records

1027
00:46:36,655 --> 00:46:38,244
♫ We corrupt my television

1028
00:46:38,244 --> 00:46:39,500
♫ People love it with stare

1029
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,712

♫ Known to get drunk

1033
00:46:44,328 --> 00:46:45,750

1157
00:50:00,126 --> 00:50:01,590
- Guaranteed to catch the most fish, dude.

1158
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:03,211
- Where the fuck did you get that thing,

1159
00:50:03,211 --> 00:50:04,666
off an infomercial or something?

1160
00:50:04,666 --> 00:50:07,000
- Yeah, dude, I was up at
three o'clock in the morning

1161
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,052
watching this thing for
like a half an hour.

1162
00:50:09,052 --> 00:50:11,083
It was great in action.

1163
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:13,432
Man, you see what I pull
outta this lake, dude,

1164
00:50:13,432 --> 00:50:14,556

1165
00:50:14,556 --> 00:50:15,800
You're gonna be jealous of me.

1166
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,853
- Jealous of you, right.
- Yeah, dude.

1167
00:50:17,853 --> 00:50:21,512
- Oh, fuck, dude, we've been
having so much fun today

1168
00:50:21,512 --> 00:50:23,657
and shit, I forgot how much
trouble you're gonna be in

1169
00:50:23,657 --> 00:50:25,468
tomorrow when we get home, man.

1170
00:50:25,468 --> 00:50:27,211
- Thanks, stick, either did I.

1171
00:50:27,211 --> 00:50:29,217
- Well, that'll give you
something to think about

1172
00:50:29,217 --> 00:50:31,892
when I'm sitting here catching
all my crazy fish, man.

1173
00:50:31,892 --> 00:50:33,273
(laughing)

1174
00:50:33,273 --> 00:50:34,190

1175
00:50:35,558 --> 00:50:36,808
Whatever, dick.

1176
00:50:39,459 --> 00:50:40,754
- Seriously, bro, you think
your parents are still at home

1177
00:50:40,754 --> 00:50:43,004
or did they bail to Canada?

1178
00:50:44,734 --> 00:50:47,317
- I seriously don't know, dude.

1179
00:50:48,723 --> 00:50:49,556
Dude.

1180
00:50:51,684 --> 00:50:54,595
It sucks I'm moving so far away, man.

1181
00:50:54,595 --> 00:50:56,548
- Fuck yeah, I know, man.

1182
00:50:56,548 --> 00:50:58,325
We've been friends for like so long, man.

1183
00:50:58,325 --> 00:50:59,158
- Yep.

1184
00:51:01,674 --> 00:51:02,825
Seems like just yesterday
we were in kindergarten

1185
00:51:02,825 --> 00:51:04,966
peeking up Heather Stanley's skirt.

1186
00:51:04,966 --> 00:51:07,016
- Holy shit, dude, you remember that?

1187
00:51:07,016 --> 00:51:08,504
You remember when her
older sister showed us

1188
00:51:08,504 --> 00:51:09,865
her fucking tits, dude?

1189
00:51:09,865 --> 00:51:11,512
- Yeah, dude, she was like
in high school then, man.

1190
00:51:11,512 --> 00:51:15,656
- Yeah, she had some big fucking titties.

1191
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:17,931
- Too bad Heather's
never got that big, huh?

1192
00:51:17,931 --> 00:51:21,243
- Dude, those were some
fucking good times, man.

1193
00:51:21,243 --> 00:51:23,435
Those were some good times.

1194
00:51:23,435 --> 00:51:25,400

- Yo, I think cool board is better

1213
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:24,251
than real life snowboarding, man.

1214
00:52:24,251 --> 00:52:25,434
- Yeah.

1215
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:27,684

1219
00:52:39,274 --> 00:52:40,639
- Hey, man I get to play the winner.

1220
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:44,589
- Winner, so you think you're
ready to test these skills?

1221
00:52:44,589 --> 00:52:45,752
I don't think so, man.

1222
00:52:45,752 --> 00:52:47,294
- Aw, shit, shut up old man,

1223
00:52:47,294 --> 00:52:50,150
you don't have any action
in your Depends garments.

1224
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:53,983
- Turn around and
accidentally bitch slap you.

1225
00:52:55,528 --> 00:52:57,707
- Yo, we gonna check out that party later?

1226
00:52:57,707 --> 00:52:58,540
- What party?

1227
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:01,414
- Oh, my sponsor's having
this little shindig

1228
00:53:01,414 --> 00:53:03,381
at some warehouse.

1229
00:53:03,381 --> 00:53:05,540
- Oh, nice, will there be
any hotties there, bro?

1230
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:08,083
- The way Brett made it sound

1231
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:10,184
there'll be some quality women there.

1232
00:53:10,184 --> 00:53:11,333
Boom.

1233
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:13,478
- Sweet, man, I need to get laid

1234
00:53:13,478 --> 00:53:14,944
before I head off to Canada anyway.

1235
00:53:14,944 --> 00:53:17,255
- Dude, you need to get laid, period, bro.

1236
00:53:17,255 --> 00:53:18,439
What's it been, like a year or two.

1237
00:53:18,439 --> 00:53:22,606
- Six months, two weeks, three
hours, and 47 minutes, dick.

1238
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:25,957
- Exactly, you can't hold
your alcohol, that's why.

1239
00:53:25,957 --> 00:53:28,272
- Dude, I just like
having a good time, man,

1240
00:53:28,272 --> 00:53:29,594
I can't help it.

1241
00:53:29,594 --> 00:53:31,637
You know, sometimes the
Jaeger gets the best of you.

1242
00:53:31,637 --> 00:53:32,870
- Yeah, hey, man, are we gonna go

1243
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:34,739
check out the party or what, man?

1244
00:53:34,739 --> 00:53:36,917
- Fuck yeah, we need to go,
they'll serve us alcohol, right?

1245
00:53:36,917 --> 00:53:38,919
- Yeah, it's gonna be set
up just like a bar, man,

1246
00:53:38,919 --> 00:53:42,586
free liquor, no ID,
it's gonna be good, man.

1247
00:53:43,605 --> 00:53:46,742
- Hey, not only that, but
they're gonna have a dance floor.

1248
00:53:46,742 --> 00:53:48,393
We gonna be able to shake our shit.

1249
00:53:48,393 --> 00:53:50,444
- Oh, that's so dope, y'all,
I can pick up so many chicks

1250
00:53:50,444 --> 00:53:52,582
when I can shake my booty.

1251
00:53:52,582 --> 00:53:55,590
- You boys do not know
how to hit the dance floor

1252
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:56,903
when we get there, get out my way,

1253
00:53:56,903 --> 00:53:59,573
I'm gonna banish it up, whoa.

1254
00:53:59,573 --> 00:54:01,658
- Hey, easy, Junior, I don't know

1255
00:54:01,658 --> 00:54:03,763
if it's gonna be that good.

1256
00:54:03,763 --> 00:54:06,180
(club music)

1257
00:54:39,919 --> 00:54:41,440
- Dude.

1258
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,937
- Hey, I gotta go see my rep, man.

1259
00:54:42,937 --> 00:54:44,075
- Dude, that's cool, man.

1260
00:54:44,075 --> 00:54:45,700
- I'll check you guys later.

1261
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:46,827
- We'll get a table.

1262
00:54:46,827 --> 00:54:48,410
- Sounds good, bro.

1263
00:54:51,366 --> 00:54:53,282
Hey, Davey, bro, there's
so much pussy here

1264
00:54:53,282 --> 00:54:55,685
if you don't get laid
you're fucking gay, kid.

1265
00:54:55,685 --> 00:54:56,768
- Never dick.

1266
00:54:58,204 --> 00:54:59,871
Let's get some beer.

1267
00:55:01,165 --> 00:55:02,709
- This is gonna be the best orgasm

1268
00:55:02,709 --> 00:55:04,792
of your life, young lady.

1269
00:55:07,156 --> 00:55:08,537
How 'bout some hot whipped cream?

1270
00:55:08,537 --> 00:55:11,358
What's an orgasm without whipped cream?

1271
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:13,051
(cheering)

1272
00:55:13,051 --> 00:55:14,493
How 'bout some pain, people?

1273
00:55:14,493 --> 00:55:15,956
Lemme hear ya.

1274
00:55:15,956 --> 00:55:18,673
(blender motor roars)

1275
00:55:18,673 --> 00:55:22,376
Oh, man, I'm a little hairy in there,

1276
00:55:22,376 --> 00:55:24,977
number two goons, come
over here right now.

1277
00:55:24,977 --> 00:55:29,133
Meet me halfway, best orgasm of your life?

1278
00:55:29,133 --> 00:55:30,768
You ready?

1279
00:55:30,768 --> 00:55:33,351
One, two, three, yeah, woo, uh.

1280
00:55:37,661 --> 00:55:39,494
Oh, thank you so much.

1281
00:55:43,123 --> 00:55:46,605
- Dude, check out that
bartender, man, she's smoking.

1282
00:55:46,605 --> 00:55:48,986
- Aw yes, she is, bro.

1283
00:55:48,986 --> 00:55:50,948
- There is nothing better than a hot chick

1284
00:55:50,948 --> 00:55:52,806
that serves you beer, huh?

1285
00:55:52,806 --> 00:55:54,542
- Yeah, except a hot chick giving you head

1286
00:55:54,542 --> 00:55:57,018
while you're drinking the
beer she just got you.

1287
00:55:57,018 --> 00:55:58,344
(ringing)

1288
00:55:58,344 --> 00:55:59,342
- Hello?

1289
00:55:59,342 --> 00:56:00,341
Put it back over here.

1290
00:56:00,341 --> 00:56:01,258
Hello, hey.

1291
00:56:02,279 --> 00:56:05,279
What's going on, man, how you doing?

1292
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,888
I'll call you back.

1293
00:56:08,888 --> 00:56:10,769
Jesus Christ.

1294
00:56:10,769 --> 00:56:12,069
Here, have a beer, man.

1295
00:56:12,069 --> 00:56:14,038
My main man, step up, have a beer.

1296
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:16,121
Hey, you're doing great, man, all that

1297
00:56:16,121 --> 00:56:17,584
- Hey, that's cool.

1298
00:56:17,584 --> 00:56:18,917
Jason, you know.

1299
00:56:21,624 --> 00:56:23,791
(ringing)

1300
00:56:25,386 --> 00:56:26,219
- Hello?

1301
00:56:27,627 --> 00:56:29,287
Beating what?

1302
00:56:29,287 --> 00:56:33,204
(environment drowns out voice)

1303
00:56:34,694 --> 00:56:38,768
Yeah, man, you should check it out, man.

1304
00:56:38,768 --> 00:56:42,844
He doesn't smoke pot, look
what happens with his career.

1305
00:56:42,844 --> 00:56:43,677
- What?

1306
00:56:44,551 --> 00:56:45,921
- He's focused in, he's doing well.

1307
00:56:45,921 --> 00:56:47,372
(ringing)

1308
00:56:47,372 --> 00:56:49,044
- You're telling me you do?

1309
00:56:49,044 --> 00:56:50,042
- Hey, hey, hey.

1310
00:56:50,042 --> 00:56:51,041
- I can do whatever you want, man.

1311
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:52,916
- Hey, what can I get for you.

1312
00:56:52,916 --> 00:56:55,242
Beers and highballs are free,
shots are three bucks apiece.

1313
00:56:55,242 --> 00:56:59,226
- Um, I guess you could get
me a couple of those beers.

1314
00:56:59,226 --> 00:57:00,410
Four?

1315
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:02,210
- Thirsty, eh?

1316
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,583
- Yeah.

1317
00:57:03,583 --> 00:57:05,666
Hey, are you from Canada?

1318
00:57:07,243 --> 00:57:09,882
- Yeah, how'd you know?

1319
00:57:09,882 --> 00:57:11,715
- [David] Thirsty, eh?

1320
00:57:12,612 --> 00:57:14,969
- Man, it always slips
out when I'm nervous.

1321
00:57:14,969 --> 00:57:15,802
Whoop.

1322
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:19,567
- No, you're doing good,
man, keep focusing in

1323
00:57:19,567 --> 00:57:21,372
like you're doing,
really, it's impressive.

1324
00:57:21,372 --> 00:57:26,208
You should watch Mark Brown
and take some lessons from him

1325
00:57:26,208 --> 00:57:27,589
(ringing)

1326
00:57:27,589 --> 00:57:28,843
And you're making progress.

1327
00:57:28,843 --> 00:57:29,946
- I appreciate it.
- Your stuff's looking good.

1328
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,502
- I really wanna get on--
- You will.

1329
00:57:31,502 --> 00:57:32,335
Hello?

1330
00:57:33,854 --> 00:57:35,021
- Here you go.

1331
00:57:36,081 --> 00:57:36,914
- Thanks.

1332
00:57:42,565 --> 00:57:45,192
- Wow, what you got going
on with that bartender, bro?

1333
00:57:45,192 --> 00:57:46,551
- Nothing, we're just talking.

1334
00:57:46,551 --> 00:57:49,111
- Hey, guys, over here.

1335
00:57:49,111 --> 00:57:51,444
Bring me some seven and sos.

1336
00:57:52,689 --> 00:57:54,432
- Yeah, we're gonna get so
fucked up tonight, you guys,

1337
00:57:54,432 --> 00:57:56,570
this shit's for free.

1338
00:57:56,570 --> 00:57:59,380
- Hey, man, where's my beer?

1339
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:01,876
- Aw, fuck, man, I guess Dave forgot, bro,

1340
00:58:01,876 --> 00:58:04,418
he was trying to hook up
with that sexy bartender.

1341
00:58:04,418 --> 00:58:06,775
- Come on, man, you're kidding me.

1342
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:08,713
Give me your beer.

1343
00:58:08,713 --> 00:58:11,546
Hey, someone give me a beer, guys.

1344
00:58:12,975 --> 00:58:14,892
Someone give me a beer.

1345
00:58:15,746 --> 00:58:18,496
I'm letting you stay at my house.

1346
00:58:20,069 --> 00:58:21,555
You guys suck, man, you know that?

1347
00:58:21,555 --> 00:58:23,389
I'm gonna remember that next time

1348
00:58:23,389 --> 00:58:25,010
you wanna stay at my house.

1349
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:27,111
- Hey, if you remember, could
you bring me back a beer?

1350
00:58:27,111 --> 00:58:28,637
- Yeah, I'll take one, too, bro.

1351
00:58:28,637 --> 00:58:30,878
- Yeah, can you make that three, four.

1352
00:58:30,878 --> 00:58:33,258
- [Man] You're a bunch
of dicks, you know that?

1353
00:58:33,258 --> 00:58:35,359
(laughing)

1354
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:38,049
- Tommy, did you have fun today or what?

1355
00:58:38,049 --> 00:58:39,759
- Fuck yeah, I did,

1356
00:58:39,759 --> 00:58:42,453
more fun of sucking a strawberry
out of a chick's pussy.

1357
00:58:42,453 --> 00:58:44,438
- You're sick, man.

1358
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:45,271
- No way.

1359
00:58:46,818 --> 00:58:48,989
- No way, you ate food
out of a chick's pussy?

1360
00:58:48,989 --> 00:58:50,313
- Yeah, all the time.

1361
00:58:50,313 --> 00:58:52,432
- I don't know about sucking
no strawberries, you know.

1362
00:58:52,432 --> 00:58:55,395
I'm more into that chocolate
over some me by, technically.

1363
00:58:55,395 --> 00:58:57,785
- You wanna go the sweet
route, you gotta go with honey.

1364
00:58:57,785 --> 00:59:00,355
Nothing beats good old honey.

1365
00:59:00,355 --> 00:59:03,938
- Hey, what are you
ladies doing over here?

1366
00:59:05,835 --> 00:59:06,835
- [All] Ohh.

1367
00:59:07,957 --> 00:59:10,479
- Major ingredient is pussy.

1368
00:59:10,479 --> 00:59:11,312
- Oh.

1369
00:59:13,254 --> 00:59:15,750
- This might sound
crazy, but this one time,

1370
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:17,016
this girl made me put peanut butter,

1371
00:59:17,016 --> 00:59:20,812
oh, had it for hours, let me tell you,

1372
00:59:20,812 --> 00:59:22,886
my tongue was so raw.

1373
00:59:22,886 --> 00:59:24,221
(laughing)

1374
00:59:24,221 --> 00:59:27,430
- You guys are either full
of it or just plain sick.

1375
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:32,208
- You do not get repeat pussy
without pleasing the pussy.

1376
00:59:32,208 --> 00:59:34,375
Pussy, pussy, p-p-p-pussy.

1377
00:59:35,308 --> 00:59:36,300
Ah.

1378
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:37,133
Oh.

1379
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:40,046
(cheering)

1380
00:59:40,046 --> 00:59:41,617
Our savior.

1381
00:59:41,617 --> 00:59:43,510
- Aw, man, you guys are assholes.

1382
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:44,938
I brought those bucket beers,

1383
00:59:44,938 --> 00:59:47,769
I thought I would at least get one.

1384
00:59:47,769 --> 00:59:51,033
Aw come on, guys, I just waited in line

1385
00:59:51,033 --> 00:59:53,877
with all those sweaty mother
fuckers and I'm thirsty.

1386
00:59:53,877 --> 00:59:55,625
(laughing)

1387
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:56,458
Come on.

1388
00:59:57,786 --> 00:59:59,448
- Stop the whining and take mine, bitch,

1389
00:59:59,448 --> 01:00:02,448
why don't you go grab another round.

1390
01:00:03,293 --> 01:00:05,836
- Hey Rob, you're gonna have
to go get off that dance floor,

1391
01:00:05,836 --> 01:00:07,612
you know what I'm saying?

1392
01:00:07,612 --> 01:00:10,029
- None of you boys can dance.

1393
01:00:11,516 --> 01:00:15,183
- Are you kidding me
man, Soul Train dancer.

1394
01:00:16,677 --> 01:00:18,921
- So, uh, how 'bout later
on, me and you get together

1395
01:00:18,921 --> 01:00:21,754
and play a little math game, yeah?

1396
01:00:22,876 --> 01:00:24,676
- How do you play the math game?

1397
01:00:24,676 --> 01:00:27,550
- Well, first you add me and you together,

1398
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:31,015
you subtract the clothes, divide the legs

1399
01:00:31,015 --> 01:00:32,848
and start multiplying.

1400
01:00:33,836 --> 01:00:36,919
- You know, I was never good at math.

1401
01:00:39,003 --> 01:00:43,773
- Um, well, in that case, I
seem to have lost my number.

1402
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:45,353
Can I have yours?

1403
01:00:45,353 --> 01:00:47,554
- Oh, what a coincidence,
I just lost mine,

1404
01:00:47,554 --> 01:00:50,601
and I was just about to ask you for yours.

1405
01:00:50,601 --> 01:00:52,401
What can I get you?

1406
01:00:52,401 --> 01:00:54,659
- Can I get six beers?

1407
01:00:54,659 --> 01:00:56,826
- So I'll catch you later?

1408
01:00:58,333 --> 01:01:00,214
- You got any pitchers back there?

1409
01:01:00,214 --> 01:01:02,818
- Yeah, lemme get you a couple.

1410
01:01:02,818 --> 01:01:05,985
- So, must get hit on a lot, you know,

1411
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,422
being a bartender and all.

1412
01:01:08,422 --> 01:01:10,396
- Yep, all the time.

1413
01:01:10,396 --> 01:01:11,813
- That must suck.

1414
01:01:13,235 --> 01:01:15,319
- It's not so bad, I just wish sometimes

1415
01:01:15,319 --> 01:01:20,076
I was looking through their
beer goggles, you know?

1416
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:24,243
- Do you think girls in
Canada will need beer goggles

1417
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:27,881
when a guy like me's hitting on them?

1418
01:01:27,881 --> 01:01:28,714
- What?

1419
01:01:31,375 --> 01:01:34,339
- Oh, I'm moving to
Canada in a couple days.

1420
01:01:34,339 --> 01:01:37,756
- What, is this a line you're feeding me?

1421
01:01:38,673 --> 01:01:41,033
- No, I'm really moving to Canada.

1422
01:01:41,033 --> 01:01:44,018
I just thought you,
being Canadian and all,

1423
01:01:44,018 --> 01:01:45,760
maybe you could give me some pointers.

1424
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,084
- Where are you moving to Canada?

1425
01:01:47,084 --> 01:01:48,301
Where are you going?

1426
01:01:48,301 --> 01:01:50,114
- This place called Calgary.

1427
01:01:50,114 --> 01:01:52,378
- Calgary, I grew up in Calgary.

1428
01:01:52,378 --> 01:01:55,425
- That's cool, so you must
know where all the cool

1429
01:01:55,425 --> 01:01:57,577
mountains are, or what it's like.

1430
01:01:57,577 --> 01:01:58,879
Are there any cool mountains?

1431
01:01:58,879 --> 01:02:00,314
- Shit, the snow up there's so good,

1432
01:02:00,314 --> 01:02:02,497
sometimes I don't know why I left it.

1433
01:02:02,497 --> 01:02:04,173
You need glasses with that?

1434
01:02:04,173 --> 01:02:06,019
- No, I'm good, thanks.

1435
01:02:06,019 --> 01:02:07,269
My name's Dave.

1436
01:02:08,677 --> 01:02:09,872
- I'm Madison.

1437
01:02:09,872 --> 01:02:10,705
- Thanks.

1438
01:02:12,489 --> 01:02:15,098
- Hey, Dave, keep that cute smile,

1439
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:17,920
you'll be just fine with
those Canadian girls.

1440
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,170
(cheering)

1441
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:57,975
- Hey, man, check out those
girls over there by the bar.

1442
01:02:57,975 --> 01:02:59,891
- Fuck yeah, that's
what I'm talking about.

1443
01:02:59,891 --> 01:03:02,319
- Fuck yeah, those are hot, dude.

1444
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:04,461
- Yeah, and I want that blonde one, man.

1445
01:03:04,461 --> 01:03:06,290
- [David] Go fucking get it up.

1446
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:08,552
- I got a beer, couple beers.

1447
01:03:08,552 --> 01:03:10,551
- Get couple beers in you, man.

1448
01:03:10,551 --> 01:03:11,874
- Oh, yeah?

1449
01:03:11,874 --> 01:03:13,273
I don't see you getting any girls.

1450
01:03:13,273 --> 01:03:15,746
- I'm just biding my time, man.

1451
01:03:15,746 --> 01:03:17,996
(laughing)

1452
01:03:19,035 --> 01:03:20,257
What are you laughing at, man?

1453
01:03:20,257 --> 01:03:22,439
You don't even know, there
really is a perfect time, man.

1454
01:03:22,439 --> 01:03:24,748
- What are you talking about, dude?

1455
01:03:24,748 --> 01:03:27,373
Look at Junior over there,
making an ass of himself.

1456
01:03:27,373 --> 01:03:28,860
(laughing)

1457
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:30,311
Look at him, what an idiot.

1458
01:03:30,311 --> 01:03:32,250
- [Man] That guy's not even
gonna score tonight, man.

1459
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:33,083
- Ow, ow.

1460
01:03:45,694 --> 01:03:49,861
- Shit, dude, check out that
hot chick Mike is dancing with.

1461
01:03:51,763 --> 01:03:52,596
- Dick.

1462
01:03:53,624 --> 01:03:57,791
- Maybe I could hook up with
one of her friends, though.

1463
01:04:02,203 --> 01:04:05,658
- Yeah, that's my boy, dude, yeah.

1464
01:04:05,658 --> 01:04:06,825
- What a dick.

1465
01:04:09,158 --> 01:04:13,325
- Now I'm fully gonna hook
up with one of her friends.

1466
01:04:19,757 --> 01:04:20,861
- So you wanna go get a beer?

1467
01:04:20,861 --> 01:04:21,694
- Uh, no.

1468
01:04:29,347 --> 01:04:30,822
- Oh, dude, what happened, man?

1469
01:04:30,822 --> 01:04:32,223
- I don't know.

1470
01:04:32,223 --> 01:04:33,225
- Where'd she go, man?

1471
01:04:33,225 --> 01:04:35,745
- Fuck her, she's a bitch, man.

1472
01:04:35,745 --> 01:04:38,949
- Shit, I was gonna hook
up with one of her friends.

1473
01:04:38,949 --> 01:04:40,365
- Yeah, you blew it, man.

1474
01:04:40,365 --> 01:04:42,690
- Fuck you, dude, at least
I'm trying to get some pussy.

1475
01:04:42,690 --> 01:04:43,523
What the fuck you doing?

1476
01:04:43,523 --> 01:04:45,398
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1477
01:04:45,398 --> 01:04:48,324
- Well, check this shit out.

1478
01:04:48,324 --> 01:04:50,768
Come on, man, let's go
hit on those chicks.

1479
01:04:50,768 --> 01:04:54,935
- All right, I hope this doesn't
fuck up my timing, though.

1480
01:04:58,481 --> 01:04:59,899
- What the fuck is up with that guy, bro,

1481
01:04:59,899 --> 01:05:02,262
he can be such a little
bitch boy sometimes.

1482
01:05:02,262 --> 01:05:04,299
- Born that way, I guess, dude.

1483
01:05:04,299 --> 01:05:06,145
Gonna grab another beer, want one?

1484
01:05:06,145 --> 01:05:08,478
- Yeah, I want another beer.

1485
01:05:11,527 --> 01:05:12,821
- So you gonna ride tomorrow?

1486
01:05:12,821 --> 01:05:16,988
- Yeah, definitely, man, I
didn't have enough time today.

1487
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:23,200
- Call, they got a great
half pipe in there.

1488
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,418
- So how good are you?

1489
01:05:25,418 --> 01:05:26,497
- Pretty good.

1490
01:05:26,497 --> 01:05:28,914
I like to ride fast and hard.

1491
01:05:30,479 --> 01:05:31,312
- Really.

1492
01:05:32,964 --> 01:05:37,047
- Here's a little something
on the house for you.

1493
01:05:44,421 --> 01:05:46,156
- (environment drowns
out voice) see you later.

1494
01:05:46,156 --> 01:05:48,415
- Okay, I'll be waiting
right here for you.

1495
01:05:48,415 --> 01:05:51,840
- So, I was so humiliated today.

1496
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:54,677
There I was on the
chair, and I looked down

1497
01:05:54,677 --> 01:05:57,196
and I saw this girl, riding down and wait,

1498
01:05:57,196 --> 01:06:00,401
she was wearing the same
snow outfit I had on,

1499
01:06:00,401 --> 01:06:03,117
oh, I just wanted to die,
you know what I'm saying?

1500
01:06:03,117 --> 01:06:06,264
- Oh, man, that's the
worst thing I ever heard.

1501
01:06:06,264 --> 01:06:09,538
- Luckily, you know, we
had her dad's credit card,

1502
01:06:09,538 --> 01:06:12,440
we just went straight to shop
and bought her a new one.

1503
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:15,738
- No fucking way, no way, seriously?

1504
01:06:15,738 --> 01:06:18,106
Listen, I swear to god,
the same exact thing

1505
01:06:18,106 --> 01:06:19,302
happened to me just the other day.

1506
01:06:19,302 --> 01:06:21,133
Same exact fucking thing, man.

1507
01:06:21,133 --> 01:06:23,284
Except I didn't have
my daddy's credit card

1508
01:06:23,284 --> 01:06:24,954
so I had to ride the rest of the day

1509
01:06:24,954 --> 01:06:27,382
without any fucking pants on.

1510
01:06:27,382 --> 01:06:29,101
- Hey, what's up?

1511
01:06:29,101 --> 01:06:31,306
Anybody want some beer?

1512
01:06:31,306 --> 01:06:33,559
- No, thank you, I only
drink wine coolers.

1513
01:06:33,559 --> 01:06:35,602
- That's the best stuff.

1514
01:06:35,602 --> 01:06:37,379
- What the fuck are you
talking about, dude?

1515
01:06:37,379 --> 01:06:39,776
- That shit's the most
disgusting shit I've ever had

1516
01:06:39,776 --> 01:06:41,772
in my fucking life, man.

1517
01:06:41,772 --> 01:06:44,559
- God, is your friend ever rude.

1518
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:46,115
- Dude, I gotta take a fucking piss.

1519
01:06:46,115 --> 01:06:48,181
- Let's hit the head, man.

1520
01:06:48,181 --> 01:06:49,931
- See you guys later.

1521
01:07:32,069 --> 01:07:34,391
- Holy shit, I am so fucking drunk.

1522
01:07:34,391 --> 01:07:36,211
- Dude, you gotta slow down
before you pass out again

1523
01:07:36,211 --> 01:07:38,013
or you ain't gonna get laid again.

1524
01:07:38,013 --> 01:07:39,569
- Oh, what are you talking about, dude,

1525
01:07:39,569 --> 01:07:41,166
I got her in the bag, man.

1526
01:07:41,166 --> 01:07:43,934
- Aw, shit, what her,
man, you got your Playboy

1527
01:07:43,934 --> 01:07:45,162
here again, or something?

1528
01:07:45,162 --> 01:07:46,742
- Ah.

1529
01:07:46,742 --> 01:07:49,426
- I gotta take a piss, man.

1530
01:07:49,426 --> 01:07:51,632
- No way, dude, I'm next, man.

1531
01:07:51,632 --> 01:07:53,826
- Fuck you, bro, I'm
jumping in there, man.

1532
01:07:53,826 --> 01:07:54,842
- She's all over me, right?

1533
01:07:54,842 --> 01:07:57,483
She's fucking freaking
and up and down up here.

1534
01:07:57,483 --> 01:07:58,551
- Did you use the phrase that pays?

1535
01:07:58,551 --> 01:07:59,550
- What, man?

1536
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:00,937
- Make love to my buttocks, Manny.

1537
01:08:00,937 --> 01:08:01,949
- What?

1538
01:08:01,949 --> 01:08:03,562
- Oh, what the fuck, dude?

1539
01:08:03,562 --> 01:08:04,562
- What?

1540
01:08:04,562 --> 01:08:06,005
- You just fucking pissed on me, man.

1541
01:08:06,005 --> 01:08:07,874
- I didn't fucking piss on you, bro.

1542
01:08:07,874 --> 01:08:09,964
- No, then why the fuck
is my hand wet, bro?

1543
01:08:09,964 --> 01:08:12,309
- I don't know, man, maybe
you pissed on yourself

1544
01:08:12,309 --> 01:08:14,027
'cause your dick's so small, bro.

1545
01:08:14,027 --> 01:08:16,013
- What are you, a fucking
faggot or something, bro?

1546
01:08:16,013 --> 01:08:17,180
You're looking at my dick?

1547
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:18,311
- Who you calling a faggot?

1548
01:08:18,311 --> 01:08:19,394
- You, bitch.

1549
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:31,988
Mother fucker.

1550
01:08:31,988 --> 01:08:34,079
Yeah, you had enough yet, pussy?

1551
01:08:34,079 --> 01:08:35,912
Fucking knock you out.

1552
01:08:40,853 --> 01:08:42,770
Better stay the fuck down, bitch,

1553
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:44,643
fucking knock you out.

1554
01:08:44,643 --> 01:08:46,226
Stay the fuck down.

1555
01:08:48,439 --> 01:08:50,106
C'mon, bitch, c'mon.

1556
01:08:54,836 --> 01:08:55,753
Shit, yeah.

1557
01:08:57,762 --> 01:08:58,761
- Let's get outta here, man.

1558
01:08:58,761 --> 01:08:59,759
- Yeah, all right.

1559
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:03,759
Hey, fucker, don't ever
piss on me again, bitch.

1560
01:09:04,902 --> 01:09:07,712
- Whoa, dude, thanks a lot,
I didn't get to take a piss.

1561
01:09:07,712 --> 01:09:09,390
- Whatever, dude, whatever,

1562
01:09:09,390 --> 01:09:11,192
did you see how I fucked that
dude up in the bathroom, bro?

1563
01:09:11,192 --> 01:09:13,771
- Yeah, dude, I saw you fuck him up, man.

1564
01:09:13,771 --> 01:09:16,771
- All right, what's happening, guys?

1565
01:09:19,357 --> 01:09:20,492
Listen to this, bro, I just
beat this guy's ass down

1566
01:09:20,492 --> 01:09:21,825
in the bathroom.

1567
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:24,530
- No shit?

1568
01:09:24,530 --> 01:09:26,056
- Swear to god, bro, he
was fucking pissing on me,

1569
01:09:26,056 --> 01:09:28,633
so I threw down and knocked the dude out.

1570
01:09:28,633 --> 01:09:29,632
- So what went down?

1571
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:31,094
- I'll tell you what went down.

1572
01:09:31,094 --> 01:09:33,254
What went down is I didn't
get to fucking take a piss,

1573
01:09:33,254 --> 01:09:34,786
that's what went down.

1574
01:09:34,786 --> 01:09:37,248
Is there another fucking
bathroom in this place, or what?

1575
01:09:37,248 --> 01:09:40,092
- Yeah, there's a bathroom over
there by the front entrance.

1576
01:09:40,092 --> 01:09:41,648
- All right.

1577
01:09:41,648 --> 01:09:43,053
Finish the story, all right, Rocky?

1578
01:09:43,053 --> 01:09:44,516
- Yeah, so check it out, right?

1579
01:09:44,516 --> 01:09:46,106
So I'm standing there
taking a piss, right,

1580
01:09:46,106 --> 01:09:48,115
he starts sprinkling a little bit over me,

1581
01:09:48,115 --> 01:09:49,752
I guess he's all fucking
drunk or something,

1582
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:54,253
so I square off to him,
I'm like yo, what up, bitch

1583
01:09:54,253 --> 01:09:56,416
- So I understand you're
looking for a math tutor.

1584
01:09:56,416 --> 01:09:58,726
- Hey, Dave, what's up?

1585
01:09:58,726 --> 01:09:59,817
- How's your night going?

1586
01:09:59,817 --> 01:10:01,211
- It's going all right.

1587
01:10:01,211 --> 01:10:02,975
You know, people don't tip as
well when the drinks are free,

1588
01:10:02,975 --> 01:10:04,225
so kinda sucks.

1589
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:07,434
- So, how 'bout a drink?

1590
01:10:07,434 --> 01:10:11,451
- Well, I don't know, I
was about to go on break.

1591
01:10:11,451 --> 01:10:14,105
- Come on, you are not
gonna make me get a drink

1592
01:10:14,105 --> 01:10:15,468
from that guy.

1593
01:10:15,468 --> 01:10:16,768
(laughing)

1594
01:10:16,768 --> 01:10:19,668
- Okay, I'll make you a deal.

1595
01:10:19,668 --> 01:10:21,793
You come and hang out with me on my break,

1596
01:10:21,793 --> 01:10:24,070
and I'll give you all
the free beers you want.

1597
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:25,650
How's that?

1598
01:10:25,650 --> 01:10:27,445
- Aren't they already free?

1599
01:10:27,445 --> 01:10:31,612
- Yeah, but I didn't have
anything else to bribe you with.

1600
01:10:34,441 --> 01:10:37,060
- Well, then, I guess
that's the best deal going.

1601
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:38,143
- Okay, cool.

1602
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:48,913
Ooh.

1603
01:10:54,129 --> 01:10:55,580
Ah, that sounds good.

1604
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:57,182
- What?

1605
01:10:57,182 --> 01:10:58,015
- Silence.

1606
01:11:00,619 --> 01:11:05,205
There's a difference, working
at a bar, and being at a bar.

1607
01:11:05,205 --> 01:11:06,540
- Is that because you're always sober

1608
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:07,781
when you're working at the bar?

1609
01:11:07,781 --> 01:11:10,698
- No, I'm usually pretty fucked up.

1610
01:11:13,285 --> 01:11:14,772
I guess it's because I'm working

1611
01:11:14,772 --> 01:11:17,546
and I'm behind a bar
and I can't go anywhere.

1612
01:11:17,546 --> 01:11:18,379
Stuck.

1613
01:11:20,483 --> 01:11:23,900
- I guess I never thought of it that way.

1614
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:28,719
- So what's taking you to Calgary?

1615
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:31,911
- You know, why do any
Americans move to Calgary?

1616
01:11:31,911 --> 01:11:34,244
- I don't know, oil, hockey?

1617
01:11:37,338 --> 01:11:38,588
- Yeah, hockey.

1618
01:11:40,179 --> 01:11:43,004
I was drafted by a
minor league team there.

1619
01:11:43,004 --> 01:11:44,635
- Really?

1620
01:11:44,635 --> 01:11:45,917
Which one?

1621
01:11:45,917 --> 01:11:50,806
- It was, um, (laughs) I can't even think

1622
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:53,464
of their name right now.

1623
01:11:53,464 --> 01:11:55,381
- Whatever, it happens.

1624
01:12:02,201 --> 01:12:04,618
You know, you're pretty cute.

1625
01:12:08,177 --> 01:12:09,010
- Thanks.

1626
01:12:09,881 --> 01:12:10,880
(laughing)

1627
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,109
- And kinda shy, too, huh?

1628
01:12:13,109 --> 01:12:17,276
Aw, come on, don't worry
about it, it's a good thing.

1629
01:12:23,244 --> 01:12:25,327
Listen, I gotta get back.

1630
01:12:26,956 --> 01:12:28,422
- Already?

1631
01:12:28,422 --> 01:12:30,268
- Yeah, I gotta get back.

1632
01:12:30,268 --> 01:12:32,207
You coming in?

1633
01:12:32,207 --> 01:12:34,645
- Nah, I'm just gonna hang here for a bit.

1634
01:12:34,645 --> 01:12:37,062
- All right, catch you later.

1635
01:12:40,043 --> 01:12:42,210
- Fuck, I'm such an idiot.

1636
01:12:49,065 --> 01:12:52,106
- I do not remember my
friends looking so good.

1637
01:12:52,106 --> 01:12:54,324
- Ah, excuse me, we've never met,

1638
01:12:54,324 --> 01:12:56,565
so how expose my friends?

1639
01:12:56,565 --> 01:13:01,067
- Ooh hoo, fiesty, hot temper,
that can only mean one thing.

1640
01:13:01,067 --> 01:13:02,463
- You know, I don't know
what you're thinking,

1641
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:04,463
but just dream on, babe.

1642
01:13:06,564 --> 01:13:10,473
- I'm just a big old huggable teddy bear.

1643
01:13:10,473 --> 01:13:13,387
- Hey, Junior, you, why
don't you introduce me

1644
01:13:13,387 --> 01:13:15,872
to your fucking hot little hos.

1645
01:13:15,872 --> 01:13:19,641
- Dave, Dave, yo, I thought you passed out

1646
01:13:19,641 --> 01:13:21,324
in a corner somewhere, man.

1647
01:13:21,324 --> 01:13:24,034
- Whatever, dick, dude.

1648
01:13:24,034 --> 01:13:26,925
So anyway, my name's Dave.

1649
01:13:26,925 --> 01:13:27,923
(laughing)

1650
01:13:27,923 --> 01:13:30,953
- Anyway, now that my friends
have introduced themselves,

1651
01:13:30,953 --> 01:13:32,953
obviously they're drunk,

1652
01:13:33,805 --> 01:13:36,712
we can get back to what
we were talking about.

1653
01:13:36,712 --> 01:13:39,487
So if you wanna get sponsored,

1654
01:13:39,487 --> 01:13:41,642
the best thing you gotta do is take a shot

1655
01:13:41,642 --> 01:13:43,910
of you doing some sort of
air or something, right?

1656
01:13:43,910 --> 01:13:45,826
Then take that down to
your local board shop--

1657
01:13:45,826 --> 01:13:47,726
- Okay, no, no, no, no, no,
that's not what you gotta do.

1658
01:13:47,726 --> 01:13:50,082
You gotta be able to store
more nuts than a squirrel.

1659
01:13:50,082 --> 01:13:51,080
- Huh?

1660
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:53,152
- You know, milk the cow.

1661
01:13:53,152 --> 01:13:53,985
- What?

1662
01:13:54,951 --> 01:13:56,920
- Feed the weasel.

1663
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:59,363
- Yeah, I'm good with animals.

1664
01:13:59,363 --> 01:14:01,732
- Hey, (environment drowns
out voice), all right?

1665
01:14:01,732 --> 01:14:03,968
- Unless, of course, you're good at it.

1666
01:14:03,968 --> 01:14:04,885
Oh, oh, oh.

1667
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:09,098
- Oh my god, you guys are assholes.

1668
01:14:09,098 --> 01:14:11,515
- I'm sorry that guy's drunk.

1669
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:14,663
- Whatever, man.

1670
01:14:15,989 --> 01:14:18,201
- All right, let's get outta here.

1671
01:14:18,201 --> 01:14:21,689
- Only if you bail your friends.

1672
01:14:21,689 --> 01:14:24,217
- Right on, let's go.

1673
01:14:24,217 --> 01:14:25,816
- Are you coming, Jase?

1674
01:14:25,816 --> 01:14:29,453
- Oh, is that how it is,
you just diss your friends

1675
01:14:29,453 --> 01:14:30,533
when pussy calls?

1676
01:14:30,533 --> 01:14:31,366
- Word.

1677
01:14:35,769 --> 01:14:38,091
- What do you say you and
me find a dark little corner

1678
01:14:38,091 --> 01:14:41,411
and get to know each
other a whole lot better?

1679
01:14:41,411 --> 01:14:44,453
- Why don't you just get a life?

1680
01:14:44,453 --> 01:14:45,974
(laughing)

1681
01:14:45,974 --> 01:14:49,654
- Oh, Dave, Dave, listen to
me, listen to me, listen.

1682
01:14:49,654 --> 01:14:53,329
Those fucking guys, those
guys are idiots, bro,

1683
01:14:53,329 --> 01:14:55,169
did you see how prude those chicks were?

1684
01:14:55,169 --> 01:14:57,329
They weren't gonna fucking
put out anyway, man.

1685
01:14:57,329 --> 01:14:59,478
- You know what, guys,
you guys are beautiful.

1686
01:14:59,478 --> 01:15:03,561
No, hey, come on, it's
four ripping snowboarders.

1687
01:15:04,457 --> 01:15:09,020
Young, good looking,
pissed out of our minds.

1688
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:10,687
We need to get laid.

1689
01:15:11,655 --> 01:15:13,339
- Junior, you're a freak.

1690
01:15:13,339 --> 01:15:16,055
- Oh, sex pot want things free.

1691
01:15:16,055 --> 01:15:18,250
- Hey, fellers, fellers,

1692
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:20,253
we need to get this fucker laid,

1693
01:15:20,253 --> 01:15:21,779
that's who we need to get laid,

1694
01:15:21,779 --> 01:15:23,126
we need to make his last night with us

1695
01:15:23,126 --> 01:15:24,990
fucking memorable, man.

1696
01:15:24,990 --> 01:15:26,490
Fucking memorable.

1697
01:15:27,909 --> 01:15:29,639
- Fuck you, I don't need
your help getting laid, dude.

1698
01:15:29,639 --> 01:15:30,472
- Yeah?

1699
01:15:31,311 --> 01:15:32,611
- No, seriously, dude.

1700
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:33,610
- Too much?

1701
01:15:33,610 --> 01:15:35,450
- To tell you the truth,
man, I'm just fucking fine

1702
01:15:35,450 --> 01:15:37,731
happy hanging out with my bros, man.

1703
01:15:37,731 --> 01:15:38,564
- Oh.

1704
01:15:39,949 --> 01:15:41,655
- Well, guys, as truly
touching as that is,

1705
01:15:41,655 --> 01:15:43,531
I would much rather be
getting laid on my last night

1706
01:15:43,531 --> 01:15:46,474
than hanging out with you hooligans.

1707
01:15:46,474 --> 01:15:48,099
- Yo, dude, don't get me wrong,

1708
01:15:48,099 --> 01:15:50,673
I'd love to get me some pussy, man.

1709
01:15:50,673 --> 01:15:54,493
- Hey, then maybe you guys
should just follow my lead.

1710
01:15:54,493 --> 01:15:55,933
- Why?

1711
01:15:55,933 --> 01:15:57,477
- Shit, don't you remember?

1712
01:15:57,477 --> 01:16:00,670
I was the only white guy to
be featured on Soul Train.

1713
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:02,170
- Ooh, Soul Train.

1714
01:16:59,641 --> 01:17:01,129
- What's your name?

1715
01:17:01,129 --> 01:17:02,317
- What?

1716
01:17:02,317 --> 01:17:04,519
- What is your name?

1717
01:17:04,519 --> 01:17:05,352
- What?

1718
01:17:06,416 --> 01:17:09,061
- Are you having a good time?

1719
01:17:09,061 --> 01:17:12,061
- I can't hear a word you're saying.

1720
01:17:55,231 --> 01:17:57,320
- I've been looking all over for you.

1721
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:58,412
I thought you left.

1722
01:17:58,412 --> 01:18:02,092
- Ah, no, I'm hanging out with my friends.

1723
01:18:02,092 --> 01:18:04,971
- That's cool. You been having fun?

1724
01:18:04,971 --> 01:18:08,221
- Yeah, yeah, we're having a good time.

1725
01:18:09,070 --> 01:18:10,219
- So I just finished.

1726
01:18:10,219 --> 01:18:12,855
I'm off for the rest of the night.

1727
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:16,779
- Great, you gonna hang out
and have a couple beers?

1728
01:18:16,779 --> 01:18:18,996
- No, I just wanna get out of her.

1729
01:18:18,996 --> 01:18:19,996
- All right.

1730
01:18:22,073 --> 01:18:23,073
That's cool.

1731
01:18:24,116 --> 01:18:25,556
Good meeting you, though.

1732
01:18:25,556 --> 01:18:29,405
Thanks for all the advice about Canada.

1733
01:18:29,405 --> 01:18:30,938
- So listen, I was thinking of grabbing

1734
01:18:30,938 --> 01:18:33,195
a couple of beers and
going back to my place.

1735
01:18:33,195 --> 01:18:34,873
I was hoping you'd come.

1736
01:18:34,873 --> 01:18:35,873
- Really?

1737
01:18:35,873 --> 01:18:36,871
- Yeah.

1738
01:18:36,871 --> 01:18:38,510
- Sounds good.

1739
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:40,136
- All right, so let's get going.

1740
01:18:40,136 --> 01:18:42,595
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, where
you going so fast, huh?

1741
01:18:42,595 --> 01:18:44,515
Where you going so fast,
you just got here, bro.

1742
01:18:44,515 --> 01:18:47,000
- I'm going home with my new friend, Dave.

1743
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,020
- Oh, your new friend, Dave, huh?

1744
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:52,020
Dave, Dave, Dave, buddy, buddy, bro.

1745
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:55,282
- Talk to you later, man.

1746
01:18:57,460 --> 01:18:58,293
- Bitch.

1747
01:19:05,784 --> 01:19:06,617
- Sup.

1748
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:12,623
- Dude, you see (environment
drowns out voice)

1749
01:19:12,623 --> 01:19:14,097
what Dave just took home?

1750
01:19:14,097 --> 01:19:15,729
- No, was she hot?

1751
01:19:15,729 --> 01:19:17,971
- Dude, you know that
fucking bartender tonight?

1752
01:19:17,971 --> 01:19:20,239
- Almost as good looking as her?

1753
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:23,572
- Dude, that was her, bro, that was her.

1754
01:19:24,439 --> 01:19:25,901
- No way.

1755
01:19:25,901 --> 01:19:26,984
- Absolutely.

1756
01:19:30,722 --> 01:19:33,188
- I'm so fucking drunk, I can't, just go.

1757
01:19:33,188 --> 01:19:35,162
- Dude, I know, I know, I know, I know.

1758
01:19:35,162 --> 01:19:37,465
I can't drive home, I'm all fucked up.

1759
01:19:37,465 --> 01:19:38,681
- What are you talking about?

1760
01:19:38,681 --> 01:19:40,402
- I'm drunk, you know.

1761
01:19:40,402 --> 01:19:43,026
- We didn't drive here, we walked.

1762
01:19:43,026 --> 01:19:43,859
Come on.

1763
01:19:51,137 --> 01:19:54,787
- So you can put those in the fridge.

1764
01:19:54,787 --> 01:19:56,454
Right through there.

1765
01:19:59,884 --> 01:20:02,067
What do you wanna hear?

1766
01:20:02,067 --> 01:20:03,785
- What do you have?

1767
01:20:03,785 --> 01:20:07,732
- [Madison] Everything from
Beastie Boys to Frank Sinatra.

1768
01:20:07,732 --> 01:20:09,482
- Whatever, you pick.

1769
01:20:11,505 --> 01:20:12,922
- [Madison] Okay.

1770
01:20:16,086 --> 01:20:18,608
- A man can beat the horses,

1771
01:20:18,608 --> 01:20:22,191
can do anything he
makes up his mind to do.

1772
01:20:24,265 --> 01:20:26,285
You like Bukowski?

1773
01:20:26,285 --> 01:20:28,702
- [Madison] Yeah, I love him.

1774
01:20:29,547 --> 01:20:30,674
- I haven't met that many people

1775
01:20:30,674 --> 01:20:33,831
that have even heard of
him, let alone read him.

1776
01:20:33,831 --> 01:20:35,004
- [Madison] Really?

1777
01:20:35,004 --> 01:20:37,849
What's your favorite book by him?

1778
01:20:37,849 --> 01:20:40,849
- Well, I only read one, Ham on Rye.

1779
01:20:41,885 --> 01:20:45,385
It was probably the best book I ever read.

1780
01:20:46,266 --> 01:20:48,866
- That's a good one, but
there are lots of others.

1781
01:20:48,866 --> 01:20:52,431
I think his best books are his
collections of short stories.

1782
01:20:52,431 --> 01:20:54,514
- I'll have to read them.

1783
01:20:56,390 --> 01:20:57,373
How's this one?

1784
01:20:57,373 --> 01:20:59,080
- This is my favorite.

1785
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:00,086
- Really?

1786
01:21:00,086 --> 01:21:01,095
- Yeah.

1787
01:21:01,095 --> 01:21:02,465
It's got the funniest story

1788
01:21:02,465 --> 01:21:04,270
about this guy who shrinks
down to six inches,

1789
01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:07,370
just for the pleasure of this woman.

1790
01:21:07,370 --> 01:21:08,438
(laughing)

1791
01:21:08,438 --> 01:21:10,435
- That sounds pretty creative.

1792
01:21:10,435 --> 01:21:14,602
- Yeah, and this one has Hitler
living in the present day.

1793
01:21:19,006 --> 01:21:21,718
Actually, these stories
come from his imagination

1794
01:21:21,718 --> 01:21:25,109
and not his experiences,
which is kinda cool

1795
01:21:25,109 --> 01:21:30,044
because it makes it different
from his other books.

1796
01:21:30,044 --> 01:21:31,688
- I think if I ever wrote
a book, it would have to be

1797
01:21:31,688 --> 01:21:33,292
from my imagination.

1798
01:21:33,292 --> 01:21:36,959
This is way more interesting
than my experiences.

1799
01:21:36,959 --> 01:21:38,914
- Why is that?

1800
01:21:38,914 --> 01:21:43,081
- I guess it's because I do
so few things to the fullest.

1801
01:21:43,929 --> 01:21:45,512
- What do you mean?

1802
01:21:46,991 --> 01:21:49,950
- Well, like when I'm snowboarding,

1803
01:21:49,950 --> 01:21:53,037
that's all I'm thinking about, you know?

1804
01:21:53,037 --> 01:21:56,361
There's a fresh dumping,
laying down first tracks,

1805
01:21:56,361 --> 01:21:59,321
I'm not thinking about what
that girl thinks of me,

1806
01:21:59,321 --> 01:22:01,724
or people nagging me,

1807
01:22:01,724 --> 01:22:04,569
I'm just thinking about snowboarding.

1808
01:22:04,569 --> 01:22:08,342
And other things, I guess it's because

1809
01:22:08,342 --> 01:22:10,385
I don't have passion for 'em.

1810
01:22:10,385 --> 01:22:13,427
I just don't seem to do 'em all the way,

1811
01:22:13,427 --> 01:22:16,690
and I see myself doing them in my head,

1812
01:22:16,690 --> 01:22:19,604
but when it comes down to
it, I just don't do it.

1813
01:22:19,604 --> 01:22:21,921
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

1814
01:22:21,921 --> 01:22:23,725
I've been trying to get out of Mammoth

1815
01:22:23,725 --> 01:22:25,602
for a couple of years now.

1816
01:22:25,602 --> 01:22:28,185
I don't know, go see the world,

1817
01:22:29,890 --> 01:22:33,884
meet new people, but life
here's pretty comfortable.

1818
01:22:33,884 --> 01:22:36,421
I make good money, I
have fun snowboarding.

1819
01:22:36,421 --> 01:22:39,382
I just can't, I just can't make that leap

1820
01:22:39,382 --> 01:22:43,549
to go and do what it is I really
see myself doing, you know?

1821
01:22:46,063 --> 01:22:47,247
- [David] I would think Mammoth would be

1822
01:22:47,247 --> 01:22:50,544
the best place to be and live.

1823
01:22:50,544 --> 01:22:52,460
- Like I said, it's nice,

1824
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:56,210
but I've got traveling
in my blood, you know?

1825
01:22:57,075 --> 01:22:58,572
It's like, what if you
had to go play for a team

1826
01:22:58,572 --> 01:22:59,954
in Michigan?

1827
01:22:59,954 --> 01:23:01,974
- What do you mean?

1828
01:23:01,974 --> 01:23:03,925
- Well, you wouldn't get to snowboard.

1829
01:23:03,925 --> 01:23:05,771
I mean, where you're
going, you've got some

1830
01:23:05,771 --> 01:23:07,408
of the best mountains in the world.

1831
01:23:07,408 --> 01:23:09,518
- I'd have to be able to snowboard.

1832
01:23:09,518 --> 01:23:11,851
It just means so much to me.

1833
01:23:12,795 --> 01:23:14,649
- Course it does.

1834
01:23:14,649 --> 01:23:18,704
- What if I never knew what
it felt like to be 20 feet

1835
01:23:18,704 --> 01:23:22,963
in the air, practically upside
down, heart just pounding,

1836
01:23:22,963 --> 01:23:25,204
just knowing I'm gonna stick it,

1837
01:23:25,204 --> 01:23:29,371
and when I do, the rush of
excitement and adrenaline.

1838
01:23:30,985 --> 01:23:33,333
Like, I'm at the top of the mountain,

1839
01:23:33,333 --> 01:23:34,470
and it's super steep,

1840
01:23:34,470 --> 01:23:36,746
it's just this tiny little
chute to get down in,

1841
01:23:36,746 --> 01:23:39,265
heart's just pounding, 'cause
you're scared shitless.

1842
01:23:39,265 --> 01:23:43,387
Just being able to say
fuck it and just go.

1843
01:23:43,387 --> 01:23:46,046
(laughing)

1844
01:23:46,046 --> 01:23:48,713
- You are so fucking sexy, Dave.

1845
01:24:03,726 --> 01:24:04,893
You know what?

1846
01:24:07,463 --> 01:24:10,713
I have to get up pretty early tomorrow.

1847
01:24:12,365 --> 01:24:15,115
So you gonna come to bed with me?

1848
01:24:17,474 --> 01:24:18,307
- Sure.

1849
01:24:58,629 --> 01:25:00,894
- Dude, I can't believe you fucking scored

1850
01:25:00,894 --> 01:25:02,976
with that hot bartender last night

1851
01:25:02,976 --> 01:25:04,891
and I didn't get fucking shit, man.

1852
01:25:04,891 --> 01:25:06,412
- Yeah, well, you know, I
guess I've been saving up

1853
01:25:06,412 --> 01:25:09,452
all my charm to unload on
the hottest chick ever.

1854
01:25:09,452 --> 01:25:10,998
- No, dude, Dave, seriously, bro, for once

1855
01:25:10,998 --> 01:25:12,879
you didn't fucking pass out.

1856
01:25:12,879 --> 01:25:15,875
For one time, bro, you
didn't fucking pass out,

1857
01:25:15,875 --> 01:25:18,958
- Ah, probably right, probably right.

1858
01:25:19,834 --> 01:25:21,937
- How old was that chick, dude?

1859
01:25:21,937 --> 01:25:23,430
- Dude, she's like 26, easy.

1860
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:25,629
- Get the fuck outta here,
does she know how old you are?

1861
01:25:25,629 --> 01:25:28,033
- No, I told her I was moving to Canada

1862
01:25:28,033 --> 01:25:30,471
to play for some minor
league hockey team up there.

1863
01:25:30,471 --> 01:25:33,617
- Get the fuck outta her,
bro, she believe that?

1864
01:25:33,617 --> 01:25:34,615
- Yeah.

1865
01:25:34,615 --> 01:25:37,878
- You fucking dog, bro,
my boy, Dave, the dog.

1866
01:25:37,878 --> 01:25:39,185
- You know it, man, I
learned from the best.

1867
01:25:39,185 --> 01:25:40,709
- Oh, true dat.

1868
01:25:40,709 --> 01:25:42,959
