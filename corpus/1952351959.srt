1
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:34,933
Gimme that old-time religion

2
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:37,102
It's good enough for me

3
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:45,511
Gimme that old-time religion

4
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,746
It's good enough for me

5
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:55,788
It was good
for the Hebrew children

6
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,390
And it's good enough for me

7
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:06,432
Gimme that old-time religion

8
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:09,101
It's good enough for me

9
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:17,209
Gimme that old-time religion

10
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,778
It's good enough for me

11
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:27,920
It will do when the world's on fire

12
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,389
And it's good enough for me

13
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:38,497
Gimme that old-time religion

14
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:41,033
It's good enough for me

15
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:49,208
Gimme that old-time religion

16
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,743
It's good enough for me

17
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:54,546
Gimme that old-time religion

18
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:57,783
It's good enough

19
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,620
For me

20
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,223
Yeah, for me

21
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,625
No gay marriage!

22
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,728
No gay marriage!
No gay marriage!

23
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,431
No gay marriage!

24
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:15,367
PAsTOR: Activist judges
and pandering legislatures

25
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:18,570
are bent on destroying
the institution of marriage

26
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:21,840
as being between one man
and one woman.

27
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:25,177
We must rise up as one voice
and proclaim,

28
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:28,413
"No! No same-sex marriage!"

29
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,220
No gay marriage!

30
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:38,891
No gay marriage!
No gay marriage!

31
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,492
No gay marriage!

32
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,760
Now, about the rapture -

33
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:42,394
we know it's comin'.

34
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:43,829
It's just a matter of how soon.

35
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,164
The answer, of course,

36
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,331
is in His hands...

37
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,901
Honey, slow down.
You're gonna trip.

38
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,736
Well, I want to get back
to the rally, hon.

39
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,638
Okay, okay. Well, just
put 'em down in the booth,

40
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,772
and Lucy and I
will take care of the rest.

41
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:54,339
All right.

42
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,842
...to be well-nourished
while we're waiting for him

43
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,345
to call us on up
to our everlasting reward.

44
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,815
so, till that time arrives...

45
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:06,185
Folks got to eat, right?

46
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,953
Meantime, while we're waitin',

47
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,755
why not try cookin' up
some of these?

48
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,124
They call for ingredients
that were already around

49
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,226
when the Bible
was first set down on paper.

50
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,827
Well, thank you kindly, Miss...

51
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:18,030
Bliss. Miranda Bliss.

52
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,432
And this here is my sister,
Lucy Dexter -

53
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:23,001
my partner,
Chief of Recipe Development,

54
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,970
and all-around inspiration.

55
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:28,874
Y'all keep us in mind
for your special caterin' needs.

56
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,310
Next time you're having a party
or some event

57
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,078
that's a little too big to handle
all by your lonesome,

58
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,379
just remember:

59
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,548
We're Fishes & Loaves
Christian Caterin'.

60
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,717
- I will, ladies. I surely will.
- Okay.

61
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,485
- Take care, now.
- Bye, now.

62
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,955
- Oh, so precious.
- I know.

63
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,489
- Gotcha!
- Aah!

64
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,025
Tom Dexter, when are
you ever gonna grow up?

65
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:48,493
Lucy, honey, is now a good time?

66
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:50,329
Yeah, ready in a sec, hon.

67
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,031
That's the baby lady
I was tellin' you about.

68
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,933
I promised her
we'd come on over and visit.

69
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:55,968
- Okay.
- All right.

70
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:56,969
- Miranda?
- Yeah.

71
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,873
I'll be there in a minute.

72
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:05,110
You know, it's been five years
since our weddin'

73
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,679
and still no luck.

74
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,482
Well, not for lack of tryin'.
Ain't that right, sweetie?

75
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,751
Tom, I don't think Miss Dawson
needs to hear -

76
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,319
DEBBIE sUE: Oh, now, Lucy.

77
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,223
Far as I know, the good Lord's not
opposed to that kind of passion,

78
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:21,426
expressed within the boundaries
of a good marriage, of course.

79
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,195
I like the way you put that,
Miss Dawson.

80
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,600
so, Debbie sue,

81
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,602
we want to know
all about Destiny's Children.

82
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,970
Well, you two may know

83
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,973
that when a couple goes in
for a fertility procedure,

84
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,842
they make a lot more eggs
than needed.

85
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:37,676
I've heard that.

86
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:40,712
But they freeze the extras anyway,
just in case.

87
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:43,482
But then sometimes, at the end,
all those extras

88
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,184
just wind up gettin' defrosted
and thrown away,

89
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:49,921
or, worse, they're donated
to stem-cell research.

90
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,624
It is our mission here
at Destiny's Children

91
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,795
to rescue as many of those
young, preborn lives as we can,

92
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:02,234
and then we make them available
to qualified childless couples.

93
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,036
Tom?

94
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:07,706
I - I think this is exactly
what we're looking for.

95
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,374
I think our prayers
have been answered.

96
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,876
Praise the Lord.

97
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:44,876
Oh, the blood ofJesus

98
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:51,877
It washes white as snow

99
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:05,864
I- I can't. I'm sorry.

100
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:12,865
It washes white as snow

101
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:33,625
so, Lucy and Tom -
They're goin' ahead with it.

102
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:36,995
The embryo adoption.

103
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,030
That Destiny's Children
organization

104
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:44,302
that was at the fair
in the booth next to us.

105
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,705
so - so what do you think?

106
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,074
About what?

107
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,711
Well, a-adoptin' an embryo.

108
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,815
Well, seems like
a right good idea...

109
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:59,117
For them.

110
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:02,554
Lord knows how hard
they've been tryin'...

111
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:05,791
the normal way.

112
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,927
What about us, Parker?

113
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:12,664
What about us?

114
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:18,837
You know what I'm talkin' about.

115
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,372
Parker Bliss sr.,

116
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,074
it has been five years
since the Lord took Parker Jr.

117
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:25,844
to sit next to him up in heaven,
and ever since then

118
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:28,447
you've managed to freeze me out
of most of your life.

119
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,751
- Miranda, I got no time for this now!
- Parker!

120
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:37,255
It's not for us
to understand His reasons.

121
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:40,325
But the Lord, He...

122
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:47,326
He wants for us
to go on with our lives.

123
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,946
Honestly, Tom,
it's just a home visit

124
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,148
before the final approval
of our embryo.

125
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,249
I just want to make sure

126
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,550
that Debbie sue gets
the right impression.

127
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,588
Oh, that must be her.
Can you get the door?

128
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:10,956
I'll be along in a minute.

129
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:17,462
All right. You just make up
your mind and come on out.

130
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:20,031
Don't you dare start fussin'
over which cologne.

131
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:24,970
You smell just fine
the way you are.

132
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,076
Her highest rating.

133
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,544
Yes.

134
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:37,215
But, Tom, why'd you have to be
so all-fired friendly?

135
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,751
Heck, honey,
I'm a friendly guy.

136
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:40,752
Ain't I?

137
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,220
Well... Hey, now.

138
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,122
- I don't know.
- Come on.

139
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:47,125
Now, friendly - my friendly's
for near about everybody.

140
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,226
Mm.

141
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:49,494
But love -

142
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:52,764
It's for you
and you alone, sweet pea.

143
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:23,295
And who's to say they'll stop
at same sex once they get that?

144
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,229
What's next?

145
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,665
"Well, I love my dog.

146
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:30,435
Great. I'll marry him. Or her. "

147
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:34,039
And how about our fine,
feathered, flying friends?

148
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,909
"Well, say, uh, my parrot and I,
we share great conversation.

149
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,779
We see eye to eye
on a great many things.

150
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,015
Great. I'll marry my bird"

151
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:47,819
Can you seejust where
all of this is leading us?

152
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,089
Here at Bunker Hill Community
Children's Hospital in Boston,

153
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,926
Dr. Sanford Price-Owens,
known as Sandy to his colleagues

154
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,395
and heartbreakingly
young patients alike,

155
00:09:57,396 --> 00:10:00,665
has had the first real breakthrough
in a decade or more

156
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,368
in the treatment
ofDietrich-Schygulla Syndrome,

157
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,737
or D.S. for short.

158
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:08,907
Dr. Price-Owens reports
that he's made good use

159
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:12,177
of two stem-cell lines made
available to him late last year

160
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:15,747
from a research lab in Helsinki
in his quest for a treatment

161
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,450
designed to prolong the lives
ofD.S. kids,

162
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:23,655
who, until recently,
have rarely lived into their teens.

163
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:26,591
I was lucky to be invited
to a festive lunch

164
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:31,129
at the beautiful home Dr. P.O. shares
with noted dance choreographer

165
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,499
and costume designer
Terry Price-Owens,

166
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,068
where the very hospitable
Terry reminded me -

167
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,971
more than once, in fact-
that he and the doctor

168
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,908
were the 17th gay couple
to be married in 2004,

169
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,311
following legalization
ofsame-sex marriage

170
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,147
in the Bay State.

171
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,850
And it should come
as no surprise to our viewers

172
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,419
that Sandy and Terry Price-Owens

173
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,188
are eager to start a family
of their own.

174
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:00,025
Well, Monica, ofcourse we
initially considered adoption,

175
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,661
but we decided
to be on the lookout

176
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,895
for an open-minded
young woman

177
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:06,097
who'd be willing
to be a surrogate mom

178
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,632
and have a biological child for us.

179
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:12,404
It was Kathy, who was
the ratherAmazon-like woman

180
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,139
who was at our luncheon -

181
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,441
She has agreed to give us

182
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:21,513
a ripe and ready stash ofeggs
from her own batch,

183
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,348
but she's also made it
perfectly clear

184
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,450
that she does not want to be
pregnant for us.

185
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,720
So, for- for us -
for Sandy and me -

186
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,989
the search is on.

187
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,591
So if there are
any young ladies out there

188
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:37,462
who would be willing
to help us...

189
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:43,668
make our dream come true,
it would be appreciated.

190
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,970
And thank you.

191
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:53,611
Oh, lead me, Lord

192
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:58,883
Oh, please show me Your way

193
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:03,154
Guide me to the righteous path

194
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:07,926
And I will never stray

195
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,895
Oh, guide me, Lord

196
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,797
For I am lost

197
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:18,136
Please see me
through this night

198
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:22,440
Let me know
the straight and true

199
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:27,112
Oh, let me see the light

200
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:31,916
Oh, lead me, Lord

201
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:37,322
Shine down upon my face

202
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:41,693
Let Your wisdom
and Your love

203
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:45,497
Return me to Your grace

204
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:52,498
Hallelujah!

205
00:12:53,038 --> 00:13:00,038
Okay.

206
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,418
Okay.

207
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,455
Dr. Price-Owens,

208
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,925
you don't know me,

209
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:20,926
but I saw the documentary
about your work on TV.

210
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,136
Five years ago,

211
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:32,137
we lost our son
to Dietrich-Schygulla syndrome.

212
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:38,516
When I saw you in your home
with your partner,

213
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:42,887
the other Mr. Price-Owens, on TV

214
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:49,761
and heard what you two are
seeking in your own lives,

215
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:52,831
I prayed hard on it,

216
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:59,204
and after not that long a time,
actually,

217
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,005
the Lord answered me.

218
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:05,210
And while I was more
than a little surprised...

219
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,045
"... The Lord
was pretty specific

220
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,447
that it's okay for me to try
and help you gentlemen

221
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:12,784
to carry your child for you,
if that's what you want. "

222
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,619
Of course it's what we want.

223
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,422
"For the time being, anyway,
I have put aside my concerns

224
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,991
that you and
the other Mr. Price-Owens

225
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,860
are what I, up to now,
have long believed

226
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:26,231
to be godless, atheistic sodomites. "

227
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,401
"The Lord has assured me
we can work all that out later. "

228
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:31,870
Probably in the afterlife.

229
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,938
"so, I write you now
to offer my services,

230
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:36,307
and, of course,
I wouldn't expect any payment.

231
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,743
Dr. Price-Owens,
you just keep helping

232
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,979
those D.s. syndrome children,

233
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,513
and with the Lord's assistance,

234
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:45,316
I'll try to help you
and the other Mr. Price-Owens

235
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,151
with what you seek.

236
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,920
Please e-mail me back
if interested.

237
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:51,689
Yours truly,
Mrs. Miranda Parker -"

238
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,159
I'm out of my mind -
"Bliss sr. "

239
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,595
No, no. Wait. Wait.
Wait, there's more.

240
00:14:57,596 --> 00:15:00,498
"P.s.
I am not a crazy person.

241
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,267
This offer is sincere,

242
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:06,371
and my uterus is in good
and working order, as far as I know. "

243
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,139
Well, honey, so is mine.

244
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,408
"I want to help. Truly. "

245
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,676
so what do you think?

246
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,011
Later?

247
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,213
What?

248
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,748
Later!

249
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,916
Sandy!

250
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:22,253
Sandy, it's not like
we're swamped with offers here.

251
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,956
I know. I know. But...

252
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:28,192
Our documentary ran
for six months -

253
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:31,629
six months -
in reruns on late-night cable.

254
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,099
I mean, let's face it.
Miranda's all we've got.

255
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,568
I am still not sure.

256
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:43,107
This is someone who got
a dispensation from you-know-who

257
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,777
saying that you and I
are temporarily suspended

258
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,578
from being abominations
before God.

259
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:48,646
Well, yes.

260
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:51,883
I- I admit that's a potential hurdle.

261
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,418
What if she changes her mind?

262
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:58,456
What if she gets another message,
like, week 34?

263
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:02,660
Sandy... This is our last shot.

264
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:08,166
I say we go for it.

265
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:11,235
Fine.

266
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,104
Fine?

267
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:19,610
Fine.

268
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,981
Dear Mrs. Bliss.
Terry Price-Owens here.

269
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,683
Sandy and I are just thrilled.

270
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,654
We'd love to have you come to Boston
at your earliest convenience.

271
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,956
We'll pay for the flight, of course,

272
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:34,659
and you can meet us
up close and personal,

273
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,761
and see what you're
getting yourself into.

274
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,931
There's not a friend
like the lowly Jesus

275
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:43,101
No, not one

276
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:46,938
None else could heal
all our souls'diseases

277
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:47,905
Parker?

278
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:50,308
I have the most wonderful news.

279
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:52,043
What's that, hon?

280
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:55,046
I...

281
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,447
Oh.

282
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:59,717
We can talk about it later.

283
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:02,153
All right.

284
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:06,124
No, not one

285
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,060
You what?!
Have you lost your mind?!

286
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:12,663
I'm telling you, the Lord wants me
to have a baby for these men.

287
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:15,700
Don't ask me to understand it,
'cause I don't -

288
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,903
not completely anyway -
but He spoke to me, okay?

289
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:21,806
And His words
were loud and clear.

290
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,275
Oh, and I'm sure Parker's
just fine with this.

291
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:27,912
Well, this isn't exactly something
I can share with him right now.

292
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,514
Uh-huh.

293
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:30,882
He's a little too wrapped up

294
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,419
in his "one man, one woman,
one marriage" activities just now

295
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,088
to comprehend
what I'm about to do.

296
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,189
Well, yeah, speakin' of which,

297
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,425
how is your own
"one man, one woman" marriage

298
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:41,559
doin' these days?

299
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,761
Well, we're workin' on it.

300
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,763
As in?

301
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:48,299
We're - we're not quite
at that stage yet.

302
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,635
Well, I don't get it.

303
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:53,871
Oh, honey, he -
he can't stop blamin' himself

304
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,573
for Parker Jr.
getting called to heaven,

305
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,542
and no matter
how many doctors tell him

306
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,210
that D.s. isn't genetic,

307
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:02,013
he just refuses to hear it.

308
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,482
Do you remember how much fun
he used to be?

309
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:05,416
Oh, right.

310
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,118
He'd write you
all those love poems.

311
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,352
There was that one

312
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,388
where the last word of every line
had to rhyme with...

313
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,023
Miranda.

314
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:18,229
Now, that Parker Bliss sr.
I know is in there somewhere,

315
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,798
and not a day goes by
that I don't pray to the Lord

316
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,768
to find him and send him
right on back to me.

317
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,570
sure, when you're not busy praying

318
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,906
on how you can lend a hand
to those homosexual gentlemen

319
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:33,377
with their -
their family planning issues.

320
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:36,280
When the Lord calls my name

321
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,715
When you comin' home
from Boston?

322
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,016
Tonight, I expect.

323
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:41,052
It's gonna be tight, but I aim
to give Parker his supper.

324
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:44,856
Nothin' to upset our routine
till this thing is... Arranged.

325
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,959
There'll be no cause for shame

326
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,528
Now, remember -
mum's the word with Parker.

327
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,830
All right. Go with God, sis.

328
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,800
Wherever He takes me.

329
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,602
- Bye.
- Bye.

330
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:02,073
I will fly like an angel
to the Lord

331
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:06,944
I will fly

332
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:13,551
I will fly like an angel
to the Lord

333
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:14,652
Knock, knock.

334
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,420
Who's there?

335
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:17,388
Oliver.

336
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:18,823
Oliver who?

337
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,560
"All over" my body
the mosquitoes are biting me.

338
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,427
Knock, knock.

339
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,062
Who's there?

340
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,030
spinach.

341
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:27,431
spinach who?

342
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,134
"It's been itchin'"
so long I got to scratch it!

343
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:40,978
Ah. Here we are.

344
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:44,615
That's him.
That is my son, Parker Jr.

345
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,350
Five years gone.

346
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,153
Well, it's for kids like your boy
I do what I do, you know.

347
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:52,523
I do. I-I truly do.

348
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,992
And the Lord, He knows it, too.

349
00:19:56,228 --> 00:20:00,898
I'm sure He does.

350
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,366
Make sure and hold on
to the handrail.

351
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,869
I was walkin' up these stairs
with a friend of mine the other day,

352
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,439
showing him the upstairs, and -
whoops - all the way down.

353
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,041
It was a mess.

354
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:14,779
This is Sandy's Old Zayde.
He was a urologist in Minsk.

355
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,349
Actually, he was a shoemaker, but
I like thinking of him as a urologist.

356
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,484
I mean, he looks like a doctor,
doesn't he?

357
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,353
I mean, his eyes
are sort of piercing

358
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:29,354
and compassionate and caring,
like a doctor should be.

359
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,568
Miranda.

360
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,970
Miranda?

361
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:41,672
I know what you're thinking.

362
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:44,542
I feel the same way every time
I come in this room.

363
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,477
Sandy doesn't care
about this sort of thing,

364
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,312
so I've really got
carte blanche in here,

365
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:51,916
and I am so pleased
with how it came out.

366
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:58,322
I can't do this.

367
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,705
Hmm.

368
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,807
Thank you, Lord.

369
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:17,775
You okay?

370
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:24,776
Oh!

371
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:40,765
Mr. Price-Owens.
Dr. Price-Owens.

372
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,166
Both?

373
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:49,167
Moral support.

374
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,481
Down the hall and to the left.

375
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,283
- You're in "A."
- Okay.

376
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,052
And you're in "B."

377
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,219
Can't we just go together?

378
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,890
You're in "A." He's in "B."

379
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:10,528
Yeah?

380
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,063
Kind of awkward, isn't it?

381
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:16,500
Yeah.

382
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,169
Well, let's get going.

383
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,987
This would be so much easier
if you were, you know, in here,

384
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:41,459
because then it would just be...
Easier.

385
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:48,460
Try the porn.

386
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:03,381
Honestly, how could anyone
get off to this?

387
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,683
It's - did you -?
Do you have a -?

388
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:08,018
shh, shh, shh!

389
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,388
I'm trying to concentrate.

390
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,791
We can't leave Miranda
in the waiting room all day.

391
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:17,061
Miranda is an angel.

392
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:21,198
I mean, how lucky were we
to have her fall into our laps?

393
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,800
Technically, it was our laptop.

394
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,636
shut up.

395
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:29,106
And get little Terry into gear.

396
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:31,509
God damn it.

397
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,077
I will.

398
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:41,085
You don't have to curse at Him.

399
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:44,455
Ugh! Humidity!

400
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:48,225
so, uh well,
this is just a little awkward,

401
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:50,861
so here goes, I guess.

402
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:54,498
Which one of you...?

403
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:55,633
Oh.

404
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:59,270
Oh, we always wanted
to mix and match.

405
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,105
Oh. Mix and match. I see.

406
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,374
- I just assumed -
- Assumed what?

407
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:06,143
Because he's white
and an ivy-league education

408
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,245
and a doctor it would be him?

409
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:09,580
Be nice.

410
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:12,183
I'm always nice, Sandy.

411
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,784
We thought we would
mix and match -

412
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:17,188
some of mine, some of his -
let nature figure it out.

413
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:20,157
No, you mean God.
God will decide.

414
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,059
Yes, darlin', I do mean God.

415
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,627
God will come down
from the heavens

416
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,163
and decide which gay man's sperm
is the swiftest.

417
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:28,165
Will it be mine?
Will it be his? Who's to say?

418
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,601
Excuse us for a minute.
Thank you very much.

419
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,170
Um, need I remind you
that she's doing us

420
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:35,306
the biggest favor
that I can conceive of?

421
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,676
Conceive - that's -
That is very funny, Dr. P.O.

422
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:39,910
Amen!

423
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:46,150
Are you washed

424
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,985
In the blood

425
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:52,122
In the soul-cleansing
blood of the lamb?

426
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:54,258
Are your garments spotless?

427
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,327
Are they white as snow?

428
00:24:56,328 --> 00:25:00,498
Are you washed
in the blood of the lamb?

429
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:04,168
Have you been to Jesus
for the cleansing power?

430
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,705
Are you washed
in the blood of the lamb?

431
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:11,141
Are you fully trusting
in His grace this hour?

432
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:14,945
Are you washed
in the blood of the lamb?

433
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:17,114
Are you washed

434
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:19,116
In the blood

435
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:22,319
In the soul-cleansing
blood of the lamb?

436
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,355
Are your garments spotless?

437
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,457
Are they white as snow?

438
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:30,461
Are you washed
in the blood of the lamb?

439
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,396
Praise the Lord.

440
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:35,533
Oh.

441
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:41,272
Excuse me.

442
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:56,981
It's here.

443
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:05,456
Okay, uh...

444
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:09,300
Hi. Hi, yes.
This is Miranda Bliss.

445
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,402
Uh, the doctor told me to call

446
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:16,774
as soon as my -
my - my package arrived.

447
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:28,452
Don't look now,
the Lord is comin'

448
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:31,121
Comin' to guide you home

449
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:39,229
Don't be sad
'cause He'll be singin'

450
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,333
Songs to guide you home

451
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:43,267
Bye.

452
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,539
You can ease up now,
smiley man.

453
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,040
We've been approved.
I'm pregnant.

454
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,076
she's not allowed to just
come along and take our baby.

455
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:54,011
Relax, hon. Debbie sue's
just doin' her job.

456
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:57,081
Oh, Tom!

457
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,918
What?

458
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:05,122
Great God,
attend while zion sings

459
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:09,526
Thejoy that from
Thy presence springs...

460
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:16,734
Hi.

461
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:19,570
Oh, there you go, Ma'am.

462
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:23,307
They've become kind of enormous,
which Tom is enjoying, of course,

463
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,210
and they're not too tender
for him to, you know.

464
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:27,578
Well, how nice for you.

465
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:31,015
All I'm getting is this constant
bloating and a voice inside

466
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:33,951
warning me to never be
that far away from a bathroom.

467
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:40,391
I don't remember this
with Parker Jr. I'm...

468
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:43,427
Are you pregnant?

469
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:46,697
I was -
I was gonna tell you, honey.

470
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,233
Yeah? Yeah?
And just when was that?

471
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,101
Well, I just - I wanted
to make sure everything was -

472
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,804
I thought this was a team effort.

473
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:54,872
A what?

474
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,140
The Destiny's Children program.

475
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:59,209
I mean, how could you just
sign us up without my consent?

476
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:06,210
Oh, uh...

477
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:38,176
Thank you, Lord.

478
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:42,486
Parker, I'm -

479
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:46,790
Miranda, I need to say somethin'.

480
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:49,560
Me and the Lord -
we been talkin'.

481
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,396
And, well, we agree 100%.

482
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:57,434
I need to welcome
this Destiny's Child into my home

483
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:01,071
and into my heart.

484
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,540
We really need to talk.

485
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,743
Oh, sweetie, no time for that.

486
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,178
We got to get ready
to have this baby.

487
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:10,547
I mean, I-I know
you're already doin' your part,

488
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,416
but I got a lot of work to do.

489
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,119
I mean, I got to get the -
the baby's room.

490
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,854
There's...

491
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:19,656
Geez, there's a lot of stuff to do.

492
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:21,759
P- Parker.

493
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,097
Yeah, I think maybe if I s-start...

494
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:31,869
Oh, lead me, Lord

495
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:36,940
Oh, please show me Your way

496
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:41,044
Guide me to the righteous path

497
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:46,950
And I will never stray

498
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,852
Take a gander, sweetheart.

499
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:51,255
Where have you been all night?

500
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:52,589
Floor plan for the baby's room.

501
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,224
Now, if you see anything you want
to change, just let me know.

502
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:55,893
Oh, now - now, Parker,
my pregnancy -

503
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:58,729
What? Are they here already?

504
00:29:58,730 --> 00:29:59,797
Who's here?

505
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,100
You'll see.

506
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,068
Hey, guy.

507
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:08,038
Lightnin'- fast service,
just like they promised.

508
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,107
What have you gone and done,
Parker?

509
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:13,377
Oh, we just got a few things,
honey.

510
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:15,045
All right.

511
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:16,880
Here, buddy,
let me give you a hand.

512
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,482
Oh, my. Okay.

513
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:36,567
Hey, Miranda.

514
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,202
Thank you.

515
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,170
I can't believe this.

516
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,339
Who's that?

517
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,309
T- that's, um, Mr. T- Price-Owens,

518
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,177
the one - the one
I was tellin' you about.

519
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:51,949
He's - he's here
for the, um, caterin' position.

520
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:57,688
Caterin' position?

521
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:01,158
You're nesting. That's not allowed.
You're not supposed to be nesting.

522
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,526
I'm the one that's supposed
to be nesting.

523
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,895
"Nesting"? What's he talking
about "nesting"?

524
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:05,696
It's a cookin' term.

525
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,432
Okay, why don't you boys
move that into the shed?

526
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,968
And you come on inside
for a cold drink, okay?

527
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:15,906
I'm sure Mr. Terry Price-Owens here
is tired and thirsty from his journey.

528
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,808
I am.

529
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,409
That is so beautiful.

530
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,712
Hmm?
I really love this one.

531
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,313
Sandy wanted me
to mail them to you,

532
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,349
but I really wanted
to deliver them personally.

533
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,550
Oh, and they're sized differently.

534
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,452
These will take you
from five months

535
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:30,821
right up until just before
your water breaks.

536
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:31,822
Wow.

537
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,957
Uh, last time,
when I was carrying Parker Jr.,

538
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,526
i think I'd just throw on
a pair of his daddy's overalls

539
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:41,231
most of the time.

540
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,367
so, uh, Mister...

541
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:44,968
- Price-Owens.
- No. Terry.

542
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,837
No, please call me Terry.

543
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:48,739
You're here to see about
joining Miranda and her sister

544
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,708
in the caterin' business?

545
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:56,413
Well, um...

546
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,381
Yes.

547
00:31:57,382 --> 00:32:00,584
Yes, um, Miranda
had expressed an interest

548
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,252
in expanding Fishes & Loaves

549
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,688
into the predominantly
African-American church market,

550
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:07,057
where I have a number of contacts.

551
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:08,458
Huh.

552
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:11,194
When you think about it, it really
does just kind of leap out at you.

553
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:13,997
As congregations grow and
churches get bigger and bigger,

554
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:16,767
the traditional potluck dinner
is really a thing of the past,

555
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,136
and that's where professionals
like Miranda

556
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:20,871
and - and myself come in.

557
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:22,506
Oh, thank you.

558
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:25,409
It sounds like you got this
right figured out.

559
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,277
I certainly hope so, Parker,

560
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,080
if - if you don't mind me
calling you Parker.

561
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:34,017
In fact, my collaboration
with Miranda and my associate

562
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:37,321
is already beginning to bear fruit.

563
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:42,559
Well, it's, uh, good news, I guess.

564
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:49,560
Uh, if - if you'll excuse us
a minute.

565
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:51,601
Ugh.

566
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:52,469
First the other thing.

567
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,237
Now you know full well
this fella's comin' into town,

568
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:55,906
you don't do me the courtesy
of a heads-up?

569
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:59,142
Honey, his arrival
kind of took me by surprise.

570
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,646
Terry, I-I wasn't expecting you
so early.

571
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,148
I'm really so sorry, Miranda.
I- I jumped the gun.

572
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:08,652
I just wanted to show you how much
I appreciate this opportunity.

573
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:12,489
Oh, okay.
That must be Lucy.

574
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:17,461
I'm gonna go see if she knows
where we're gonna put you up.

575
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:20,931
Uh, honey, can you help him get
his bags out to the van, please?

576
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:23,100
Great. Okay.

577
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:29,139
Yeah.

578
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,709
I see you're not exactly
a believer in traveling light.

579
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,479
The man came all the way
down here from Boston

580
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,014
to give you maternity clothes?

581
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,148
I guess.

582
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:40,684
And he - you told Parker
we're auditioning him

583
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,152
for Fishes & Loaves?

584
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,154
It's funny how
she hasn't mentioned it before.

585
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,455
I mean, I haven't heard word one

586
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:46,990
about her wanting
to expand like this.

587
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:49,493
Well, however she came to it,
I am, as you folks say,

588
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,128
pleased as punch to play my part.

589
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,329
Yeah.

590
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,630
Okay, be careful.

591
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:55,132
Okay, honey,
help me get him out of here

592
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,868
before he starts asking Parker
questions about that baby crib.

593
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:01,004
Okay! We ready to go?

594
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:03,573
I got that - Could you be -?
It has wheels on it.

595
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:05,675
Yeah, I don't like to use the wheels.

596
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,644
But that's what the wheels are for.

597
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:08,245
No, no, don't -

598
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:12,682
He's got it.
You got it, honey?

599
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:15,986
I really like your husband,
especially the mustache.

600
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:18,889
Very charming.

601
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,924
We need to get you settled
into your motel

602
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,527
so I can buy the time I need
to find a better way

603
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:27,998
to explain to Parker
about what you're doin' here.

604
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:32,135
Terry, what are you doin' here?

605
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:35,038
Um...

606
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:35,539
Oh!

607
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,541
I- I am so sorry.

608
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:40,877
I guess I plumb forgot
to introduce you two.

609
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:42,746
Terry, this is my sister, Lucy.

610
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,615
she knows all about you,
Sandy, and the baby.

611
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:48,685
Luce, may I present to you
Mr. Terry Price-Owens?

612
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:50,854
50% likely putative father

613
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:53,790
of the child I'm carrying
at the Lord's behest.

614
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:56,927
Um... Pleased to meet you.

615
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,463
Ah. Likewise.

616
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:03,200
I don't think I've ever been introduced
in quite those terms before.

617
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,168
Well, these are
extraordinary times.

618
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:07,170
- Amen.
- Amen.

619
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:10,040
Now, you tell me if I'm speaking
out of turn here,

620
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,375
but I do believe our man Terry

621
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:15,078
has come down here
from Boston, Massachusetts,

622
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:18,582
expecting to run your life 24/7
until you deliver the goods.

623
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:21,284
T- that's not a possibility.

624
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,819
- You're wrong, Lucy.
- No?

625
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,055
Then why'd he make us stop off
so he could buy himself

626
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,923
a top-of-the-line
portable sewing machine

627
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:29,759
if he isn't planning on being
down here for the long haul?

628
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,796
Oh, Lucy.

629
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,864
Oh, no.

630
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,832
Oh. Look, Lucy -

631
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:38,301
I'll be blunt because Miranda can't.

632
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,104
Mr. Price-Owens - Terry -

633
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,173
Don't you have a job
to get back to up north?

634
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:44,407
Lucy.

635
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:46,276
Oh, the beauty
of the kind of work I do

636
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:48,445
is that it can be done
from anywhere.

637
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:53,083
Well, how lucky for Miranda.

638
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,951
And, uh, how will -

639
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:57,687
How does the other
Mr. Price-Owens feel

640
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:58,922
about your absence?

641
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:02,859
My partner, Sandy,
is very supportive.

642
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,297
There is the matter of the mattress.

643
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:14,298
- The what?
- The what?

644
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,176
Well, so much for your hope

645
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:22,512
that Terry won't be trying
to micromanage your pregnancy.

646
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,482
Oh, I'm so sorry, Lucy.
I couldn't help but overhear.

647
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,751
And I challenge you
to offer one good reason

648
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:31,188
why my child's carrier shouldn't
have the most restful sleep

649
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,455
commercially available.

650
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:33,523
Well, silly me.

651
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,592
I thought that's what
her uterus was for.

652
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:41,565
You know, I think I detect
a bit of jealousy here.

653
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:44,067
And where, for that matter,
is your husband?

654
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:45,835
And why is he not here
at the Heavenly Rest

655
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:47,437
selecting a premium model for you

656
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:49,206
as I intend to do for Miranda?

657
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,241
Uh, Miranda?
Excuse me, doll.

658
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:53,777
I really love this comfort
Extraordinaire super King,

659
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,946
and I think it would be perfect
for you and Parker.

660
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:59,516
I take it your lifestyle coach
from up Beantown Way

661
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:02,385
hasn't been upstairs
in your house yet.

662
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,387
Now may be a good time
to tell Terry here

663
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,122
how the super King-sized mattress

664
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:07,390
would be a super
king-sized mistake.

665
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,325
You know, it's funny -

666
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:15,326
Okay! Just stop talking!

667
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,726
You have no right
to run offabandoning me,

668
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:45,562
driving that woman bananas.

669
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:49,766
Call me.

670
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,736
"Directions. Warning.

671
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:55,639
Isobutane. " Of course.

672
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,941
Let's see.

673
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,644
Ugh.

674
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,512
- Hey, what you lookin' for?
- Hey.

675
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:04,514
Um, uh, arrowroot.

676
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:07,183
I'm looking for the arrowroot.

677
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:08,685
That's some kind of spice?

678
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:09,853
Um, I'm making a fruit pie.

679
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:11,388
My grandmother
has this amazing recipe,

680
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:13,256
and I thought I'd make some
for Miranda and Lucy.

681
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,091
You should stay around
for the taste test later.

682
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:16,960
Oh, yeah? I might just
take you up on that, Terry.

683
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,928
- I do enjoy a good fruit pie.
- Yeah, yeah, me too.

684
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,598
Hey, uh, what's goin' on
in here, boys?

685
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,634
Hey, hon, can you help him
find the arrowroot?

686
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,669
Arrowroot, huh?

687
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,237
Yeah, I got to head down
to the church.

688
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:28,972
Got to help the pastor
with a busted ceiling light.

689
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,240
see y'all later.

690
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,809
Okay. Hey, bye, Parker.

691
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,277
What are you doin' in here?

692
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:36,246
Have you ever heard
of teratogens?

693
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:39,115
- "Terato" what?
- Teratogens.

694
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:40,083
Excuse me.

695
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:42,285
I mean, who puts this
next to the flour?

696
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:47,324
Miranda, scientists have identified
over 325 substances

697
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,160
that are directly linked
to malformation in fetuses.

698
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:53,163
Well, someone has certainly
been doin' his homework.

699
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,732
I really need you
to take this seriously.

700
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:58,601
Over 325 substances,

701
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:02,005
and they are all found
in common household products.

702
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,974
All right, I don't know
where you think you are, Mister,

703
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:08,244
but I would greatly appreciate it
if you would get out of my kitchen,

704
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:10,046
'cause I - I've got work to do.

705
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:13,850
- And so do I.
- Okay.

706
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:20,851
And this, too. Poison!

707
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:28,798
What in God's name
are you doin' in here?

708
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:31,267
All these things are toxins,
so I just want to throw them out

709
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:33,370
and make the environment safe
for when the baby gets here.

710
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,005
Okay, you know what?
That's it!

711
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,640
I want you to leave.

712
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:44,614
Go back to the motel, and do not
come back here until I say so!

713
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:48,385
Git!

714
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,754
You are sneaking into the
workshop ofa fanatic homophobe

715
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:52,489
to help him
with his spring cleaning,

716
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,824
andI'm supposed to remain calm?

717
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:58,728
What in the hell does this
have to do with our baby?

718
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:02,365
No, no. This woman is perfectly
capable of having this baby

719
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:04,234
without you
breathing down her neck,

720
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:08,138
so I would like you to come home
before you ruin everything.

721
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,911
There's not a friend
like the lowly Jesus

722
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:18,047
No, not one

723
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:21,317
None else could heal
all our souls'diseases

724
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:24,687
No, not one

725
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:27,690
Jesus knows
all about our struggles

726
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:30,894
He will guide
till the day is done

727
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:34,130
There's not a friend
like the lowly Jesus

728
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:37,267
No, not one

729
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,570
There's not an hour
that He is not near us

730
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:43,673
No, not one

731
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:46,910
No night so dark
but His love can cheer us

732
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:49,679
No, not one

733
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,651
If we're gonna do this thing,
let's do it.

734
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:57,253
I love this fabric.

735
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:59,856
You promised the man a fruit pie.

736
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,991
No, not one

737
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:04,527
Put some clothes on.

738
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:13,236
No, not one

739
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:20,237
Hormones.

740
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:07,050
Lucy, I'm home.

741
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:12,295
Lucy?

742
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:25,602
Baby.

743
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:49,732
sweetheart?

744
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,200
Hey.

745
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:54,237
Tom...
I went downtown today.

746
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:57,006
Lucy, honey, you'll never guess

747
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:59,809
who I ran into today
down at the Coover Diner.

748
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,277
I might.

749
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:03,580
Debbie sue Dawson.

750
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,648
Guess what.

751
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:07,984
Come on.
I bet ya can't guess.

752
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:10,019
Come on. Come on.

753
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,854
It's okay.

754
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:13,990
Well, I'm gonna tell ya.

755
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:18,461
Debbie sue - s-she wants to know
c- could you and I

756
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:21,598
give a series of presentations
to couples around here

757
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,900
that are lookin'
into Destiny's Children.

758
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:28,705
seein' as how we're so excited
and satisfied by the program.

759
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,173
Presentations?

760
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,876
That's what you two were talkin'
about over at the diner?

761
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:35,612
Well, yeah, honey.

762
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,447
she wants us to be
her spokespeople.

763
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,349
Whole region - her territory.

764
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:43,186
It's region 12.
That's what she told me.

765
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:48,157
I'm so sorry.

766
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:49,258
- It's okay.
- I love you.

767
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:55,365
I love you, too, baby.

768
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:58,801
Whoa, easy on the arrowroot there,
Martha stewart.

769
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,336
You want to thicken it a tad,

770
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:02,939
not turn it into a fruit-flavored
concrete block.

771
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,142
Well, Miranda,
it is my first time.

772
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:09,212
Now, why does that
not surprise me?

773
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:11,047
Hmm, I don't know.

774
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:18,048
I'm not the one
who lied to my husband.

775
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:22,425
I'll take it from here,
thank you very much.

776
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:26,362
Fine.

777
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:29,165
First rule of a good manager -
learn how to delegate.

778
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:36,166
Hmm.

779
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,175
Well, go ahead.

780
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,210
Tell me what you whipped us up
for dessert.

781
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:43,513
Wait. Don't tell me. surprise me.

782
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,182
Tom, I did mention it, didn't I?

783
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,451
We're invited to my sister's
for dessert.

784
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:51,454
That Terry fella we're auditioning
for Fishes & Loaves -

785
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:53,856
word is he was tearing up
the kitchen all afternoon.

786
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,792
He's supposed to show us
what he can do.

787
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:58,194
sweetheart, I-I can't do that.

788
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:01,664
I got to meet a client
after he gets off of work.

789
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:04,067
You know how the boss says
I got to go out of my way

790
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:08,638
and accommodate all these clients.

791
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:11,708
Look.

792
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:12,842
Tell you what.

793
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:17,513
I will scoot right on over there
as soon as I'm done with this guy.

794
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:24,514
It's all right.
You don't have to bother.

795
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:39,001
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

796
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:40,436
Parker.

797
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:42,171
Thanks, Terry.

798
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:49,011
Looks good.

799
00:45:56,787 --> 00:46:00,723
Tell you somethin', Terry,
that's a tasty pie.

800
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:03,559
Whatever you do, hon, don't
let him get away. He's good.

801
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,162
Not much chance
of that happenin', sweetheart.

802
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:08,064
I believe
Mr. Terry Price-Owens here

803
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:10,500
is with us for the long haul.

804
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:17,406
Amen.

805
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:20,409
This is your little ol'
Georgia peach Terry Price-Owens.

806
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:24,881
Please leave a message, y'all.
Yee-haw!

807
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:31,354
You are driving me crazy.

808
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:36,125
Mmm.

809
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:38,928
Well, it's a shame I can't
stick around for another slice.

810
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:42,532
Parker's headin' out to help out
with the Family Martial Arts.

811
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:45,635
Oh. Is that why
he's wearing that... Gi?

812
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,638
I thought it was some strange
local custom I knew nothing about.

813
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,440
Break a board for me, Parker.
Two, if you're so inclined.

814
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:54,644
Will do, Terry.

815
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,280
Hmm?

816
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:01,083
That's ridiculous.
You can't see any features.

817
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:03,286
How can you possibly say
he looks like your grandfather?

818
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:04,587
That does look like my grand-

819
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:07,089
First of all,
you never met my grandfather.

820
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:09,892
second, you see that right there?

821
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:10,927
Right there. That bump.

822
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:12,895
- It's right here, too.
- What bump?

823
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:14,964
The bump.
Those are feet.

824
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:16,365
Everybody on my mother's side
of the family

825
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:18,401
has feet just like that -
those are feet.

826
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:20,636
I can't even tell if I'm lookin'
at a head or a kneecap.

827
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:22,004
That's because
you're looking at feet.

828
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,906
Oh, good Lord.

829
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:26,142
There's so much room in there.
Mine are all scrunched up.

830
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:28,144
What?

831
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:29,312
Twins, Terry.

832
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:31,347
she's having twins.
she just found out.

833
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,381
Isn't it wonderful?

834
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:33,816
Oh. Yes, it is wonderful.

835
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:35,017
Congratulations.

836
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,220
Hey. What's goin' on?

837
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:43,326
I - we're just, um...

838
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:46,762
What's that? It...

839
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:51,434
Pictures of our baby?

840
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:57,273
What, you show this fella
before you show me?

841
00:47:57,274 --> 00:48:00,009
You don't understand, Parker.

842
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:02,211
Oh, I understand, all right.

843
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:06,215
Well, who's shutting who out now?

844
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:09,051
All right, I-I ca-
I can't do this anymore.

845
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,053
Well, then, spell it out
for me then, Miranda.

846
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:18,054
Parker, this child I am carrying,
it is not a Destiny's Child.

847
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:25,234
What are you talking about?

848
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:28,170
That baby in there -
That's our baby.

849
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:30,773
No, Parker.

850
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:36,312
It's not.

851
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:43,313
I'm carrying this baby as a surrogate
for a couple out of Boston.

852
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:46,489
"surrogate"? W-?

853
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:51,227
Yes, Parker.

854
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:54,397
I prayed hard on it, Parker.
I- I did.

855
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:58,634
I'm - I'm just trying
to obey the Lord here.

856
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:00,469
How dare you!

857
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:05,675
How dare you put
what you have done on the Lord!

858
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:12,676
Whose baby is this?

859
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:22,858
It's his.

860
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:29,859
Well, is there anything else you think
I might want to know, Terry?

861
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:46,048
I am...

862
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:52,989
not a chef.

863
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,559
shame on you.

864
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:03,560
shame on all you.

865
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:07,036
This is
Dr. Sandford Price-Owens.

866
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:09,305
Please leave a message
at the beep.

867
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:10,639
Hey, Sandy.

868
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,141
It's Terry.

869
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:15,511
Miss you.

870
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:20,049
so, look, I know we've had
some bumps along the way,

871
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:27,050
and I'm trying to unbump them.

872
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:29,425
Call me back, okay?

873
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:36,426
Please.

874
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:39,535
Hangman's coming now

875
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,704
The sky's turned gray

876
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:45,508
No one's laughing anymore

877
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:47,610
Standing alone

878
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:49,845
The moon on his face

879
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:52,048
Hangman's coming now

880
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:57,853
Soon it's gonna rain

881
00:50:57,854 --> 00:51:03,993
Well, if it ain't Papa Terry.

882
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:09,231
You reckon you want
to take me on?

883
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,534
Yeah. Be my pleasure.

884
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:16,739
Soon it's gonna rain

885
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:21,243
Break through this life
ofhardness and pain

886
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:25,181
Taking the blood from a stone

887
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:30,019
At the end of the road,
it all looks the same

888
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,088
Hangman's coming now

889
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:36,525
Soon it's gonna rain

890
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:43,526
Not much of a bowler, I see.

891
00:51:48,004 --> 00:51:48,971
Well, let me show you.

892
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:51,373
You want to keep your hand
under the ball, not on top.

893
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:52,808
That's your problem.

894
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:56,045
I'm gonna show you.

895
00:51:56,046 --> 00:52:00,449
One of these days,
I'm gonna pack up my things

896
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:05,421
Follow my heart on the road

897
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:08,457
see what I mean?

898
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:09,358
Yeah.

899
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:16,165
Yeah. Give it a shot.

900
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:17,066
On the bottom?

901
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:22,505
Yeah, keep your hand underneath,
not on the top.

902
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:24,373
Keep that wrist stiff now.

903
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:28,978
At the end of the road,
it all looks the same

904
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,213
Hangman's coming now

905
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:33,449
Soon it's gonna rain

906
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:41,924
Well, looks like you're catchin' on.

907
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:44,059
Near about
took apart our marriage

908
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:48,797
just as sure as it took apart
our boy's nervous system.

909
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:52,635
I tell you, I don't wish
that disease on any family.

910
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:55,471
What it did to us.

911
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:59,208
D.s. just...

912
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:03,412
Dietrich-Schygulla.

913
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:04,847
Yeah.

914
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:11,420
My Sandy deals with it every day,
brings it home every night.

915
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:14,823
I don't think I say it enough.
I don't think I -

916
00:53:14,824 --> 00:53:21,564
I tell him how proud I am of him.

917
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:28,070
"Him"?
You - you mean her.

918
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:35,377
No, I-I meant he.

919
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:39,048
Um, Sandy is my husband.

920
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,749
sanford Price-Owens.

921
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:44,220
We have been married
for four years legally.

922
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:47,856
And - and, Parker, I didn't -
I didn't mean to spring this on you.

923
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:54,857
- I-I really did not.
- Yeah, okay. Okay, yeah.

924
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:05,268
That didn't go well.

925
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:36,505
Mind if I come in?

926
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:39,975
Yeah, come on in.

927
00:54:39,976 --> 00:54:41,944
I brought music -

928
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,746
Oh.

929
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:48,384
- Um, for the baby.
- Okay.

930
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:50,286
Well, scientists say
they can hear in utero,

931
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:57,287
so thought I'd bring something
that Sandy and I like.

932
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:08,837
Okay, well, uh...
I have work to do.

933
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:12,474
Actually, I, uh,
I kind of need you to stay,

934
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,743
because you...

935
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:16,745
- Right.
- You have the baby.

936
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:23,052
Wow.

937
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:25,988
Whoo.

938
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,456
Do you like this kind of music?

939
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:29,558
Uh, yeah, sure.

940
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:33,429
Do you, uh... dance?

941
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,931
Not like that, sir.

942
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:38,334
Well, lucky for you,
I'm a choreographer, so I can...

943
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:42,137
I don't need a choreographer.
I've got my own moves.

944
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:43,439
Excuse me.

945
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,441
I didn't mean to insult you.

946
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:50,979
so, uh, so show me the moves.

947
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,648
You first.

948
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:56,452
Okay.

949
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:57,653
Wow.

950
00:55:57,654 --> 00:56:00,856
Well, you can join in.
It's okay.

951
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,591
It's easy.
We're just doing a little salsa.

952
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:04,626
so you one, two.

953
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:05,961
I know it feels awkward,

954
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:09,398
but when you just start moving,
you get used to it.

955
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:11,266
Yeah, just relax, you know?

956
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:12,468
I'm relaxed.

957
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:15,604
Okay.

958
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:18,140
Very nice.

959
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:20,442
some nice hip action there,
Terry dear.

960
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:22,378
Keep the hands steady.

961
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,546
That's it. Now -

962
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:25,681
Oh, okay.

963
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:27,082
That's all right.
stay with me.

964
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:30,352
I'm with you.

965
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:32,221
see?

966
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:36,258
Whoo! Oh!

967
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:37,926
Okay.

968
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:38,961
- Back in.
- Okay.

969
00:56:38,962 --> 00:56:41,296
That's it. Very nice.

970
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:43,465
I'm impressed.

971
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:45,267
Do you want to hear
something funny?

972
00:56:45,268 --> 00:56:46,802
sure.

973
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:50,706
Parker and I -
we used to dance all the time.

974
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:55,377
Yeah.
That's, uh, that's funny.

975
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:56,812
Well, it's not that funny.

976
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:58,080
He was a -
he was a good dancer.

977
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,716
He just would tear up
the dance floor.

978
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:02,451
You -
you should have seen it.

979
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:05,320
- Parker?
- Yes, Parker.

980
00:57:05,321 --> 00:57:07,890
He was.

981
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:10,159
Ooh!
Ter-

982
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:11,894
And spin out.

983
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:18,333
This is salsa.

984
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:20,369
I'm gonna teach you more.

985
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:21,737
I'm sure you will. Hi.

986
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:23,405
- Miranda Bliss?
- Yes, sir.

987
00:57:23,406 --> 00:57:24,506
For you, Ma'am.

988
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:31,507
Thank you.

989
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:39,615
What is it?

990
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:52,762
Looks like my bowling buddy
is suing for custody of our child.

991
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:58,907
I'm sorry.

992
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:01,743
Farewell, my friends

993
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:06,381
I'm bound for Canaan

994
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:13,382
I'm travelin'
through the wilderness

995
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:17,526
Your company has...

996
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:19,127
You got to admit, I warned you.

997
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:20,395
How long did you two think

998
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:21,864
you could pull the wool
over Parker's eyes?

999
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:24,733
I wasn't thinking that far ahead.

1000
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:26,435
Oh, honey, since
the day Terry Price-Owens

1001
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:28,804
showed up on my doorstep,
I've just been winging it.

1002
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:31,073
Well, the one thing
I can't understand is,

1003
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:34,776
why in heaven's name does Parker
even want the gay men's baby?

1004
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:37,179
I have spent the last week
praying on that exact question.

1005
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,716
And the Lord, if He knows, sure
enough isn't dropping any hints.

1006
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:42,284
There's Parker.
I'll see you inside.

1007
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:46,054
All right.

1008
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:49,791
Look, I don't expect you
to understand, Parker.

1009
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:54,196
Maybe you will someday,
but please remember one thing -

1010
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:57,199
no matter what happens here,

1011
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,834
I love you very much.

1012
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:00,836
Well, if you do, you'd just stop with -

1013
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:05,407
But this baby -
that is somethin' else entirely.

1014
00:59:05,408 --> 00:59:09,645
I feel blessed
that the Lord has chosen me

1015
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:13,382
to help these two good men
with the family they always wanted.

1016
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,118
Miranda, you are playing with fire.

1017
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:20,289
Truly, you will be sorry.

1018
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:23,592
Ms. Mason, does your client

1019
00:59:23,593 --> 00:59:27,062
contend in any other way
we may have failed to imagine

1020
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:30,832
that - that he -
that Parker Bliss sr.

1021
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:34,703
is this child-to-be's
biological father?

1022
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:36,538
MAsON: No, Your Honor,
he does not.

1023
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:39,675
Mr. Bliss asserts his paternal
rights under the applicable law

1024
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:43,145
given his status as lawful
husband of Miranda Bliss,

1025
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:48,750
who has testified that she is,
after all, undeniably pregnant.

1026
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,986
Dr. Price-Owens,

1027
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:55,724
do we know who is
the actual biological father?

1028
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:56,925
- I am.
- I am.

1029
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:02,698
I see.

1030
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:09,104
The witness may step down.

1031
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,740
There being nothing further,

1032
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:15,944
I'm ready to rule
on the motion at hand.

1033
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:18,447
The extensive testimony

1034
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:22,084
and clinical evidence to back it
all up tell me that these -

1035
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:29,085
these men have successfully
borrowed Miranda's uterus

1036
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:34,429
for the - for the duration.

1037
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:37,432
And, um

1038
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:39,601
the Price-Owenses
and Mrs. Bliss here

1039
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:44,239
have met their evidentiary
burden of showing

1040
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,109
that though you, Parker,
are Miranda's husband,

1041
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:50,779
you are not the biological
father of this child.

1042
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:54,783
And for that matter,
everyone involved

1043
01:00:54,784 --> 01:01:00,088
seems to agree that Miranda
is not its mother.

1044
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:03,358
Listen, if I'm sounding
a bit squeamish

1045
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:07,496
talkin' out loud about all of this,
well, by golly, I am.

1046
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:10,699
But my duty is my duty, Parker,

1047
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:15,637
and I am forced
to deny your motion.

1048
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:20,275
Case dismissed.

1049
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:22,944
You didn't lose, Parker.
There's no winners or losers here.

1050
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:28,750
It - it's not about that.

1051
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:31,620
And Terry Price-Owens -
he's - he's the same man

1052
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:33,955
you were just getting to know
and really like

1053
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:38,026
before - before you knew.

1054
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:43,565
I mean, isn't he?

1055
01:01:43,566 --> 01:01:45,934
Parker.

1056
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:32,781
Oh, the blood ofJesus

1057
01:02:32,782 --> 01:02:39,782
It washes white as snow

1058
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:21,329
Hyah!

1059
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:24,966
Hyah!

1060
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:53,995
Ron, I just saw Parker pulling out
while I was pulling in.

1061
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:56,031
Just what did he say to you?

1062
01:03:56,032 --> 01:04:00,836
Uh, I'm sorry, Miranda,
but things being what they are,

1063
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:03,638
we're gonna go with another
caterer for the awards banquet.

1064
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:08,276
We really can't have
this kind of attention just now.

1065
01:04:08,277 --> 01:04:10,946
I'm sorry.

1066
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:16,184
I got to get back to my kids.

1067
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:18,987
Cab's gonna be here
in five.

1068
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:21,323
Have you seen my Prada?

1069
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:23,391
The two-tone loafers
you got me for my birthday?

1070
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:30,392
Oh, you returned those
and got yourself a different pair.

1071
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:38,840
Aha!

1072
01:04:42,478 --> 01:04:47,015
Who is it?

1073
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:48,917
I don't know, but you're not
allowed to touch it.

1074
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:50,518
Where did you put my phone,
Sandy?

1075
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:51,353
No!

1076
01:04:51,354 --> 01:04:53,622
stop wrinkling all the clothes!

1077
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:59,594
Tell her you're on your way
to the airport.

1078
01:04:59,595 --> 01:05:01,763
Hey, Miranda.

1079
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:03,632
Mm-hmm, we're on our way
to the airport.

1080
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:06,334
Hmm.

1081
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:08,837
Oh, my God!

1082
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:12,040
He did what?

1083
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:13,975
I'm on my way.

1084
01:05:13,976 --> 01:05:16,111
Yep. Right now.
I'm on my way.

1085
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:17,245
What? What happened?

1086
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:19,848
Parker sr. went and badmouthed
Lucy and Miranda,

1087
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:22,217
and they decided to find another
caterer for the award banquet.

1088
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:24,185
Terrible!
Put on some pants.

1089
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,888
Sandy, I cannot go to Boston.

1090
01:05:26,889 --> 01:05:30,091
I need to take this cab, and I need
to go to Miranda's right now.

1091
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:33,261
Why don't you call her
when we get to Boston?

1092
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:36,598
Because I can't!

1093
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:40,969
Sandy!

1094
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:42,437
I'm doing this for us.

1095
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:45,974
Oh, you have done
quite enough already.

1096
01:05:45,975 --> 01:05:48,410
If you hadn't insisted
on coming down here,

1097
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:51,079
Miranda would have handled this
all by herself,

1098
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:55,250
and none of this
would have happened!

1099
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:57,819
You don't talk to me like that.

1100
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:00,588
You don't tell me what to do
or how to do it.

1101
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:02,557
And when I do come home,

1102
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:04,592
you better be standing there with a...

1103
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:07,295
a warm heart
and a smile, okay?

1104
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:10,799
You better hope
I haven't changed the locks.

1105
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,535
You wouldn't.

1106
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:20,075
Try me.

1107
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:28,877
Sandy!

1108
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:37,920
Take a picture. It lasts longer.

1109
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:15,897
You know, we had
a fella at the church, he, uh...

1110
01:07:15,898 --> 01:07:17,732
Well, he had your condition and -

1111
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:20,268
Let me guess.
You put him in a cure program.

1112
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:22,003
30-day treatment?

1113
01:07:22,004 --> 01:07:24,139
Yep.

1114
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:26,174
Church paid his expenses,
as a matter of fact.

1115
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:30,211
You know what?
It worked.

1116
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:32,647
That's wonderful.

1117
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:36,551
Maybe Sandy and I can check in,

1118
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:39,487
possibly even get
a couple's discount,

1119
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:46,361
maybe even share a bunk bed.

1120
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:52,100
Yeah, well, maybe the program's
not for everyone.

1121
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:56,237
Thank you.

1122
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:59,374
Now that we, um, got that
out of the way...

1123
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:08,083
I want to know the extent of your
campaign to ruin Fishes & Loaves.

1124
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:09,517
Ain't no campaign.

1125
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:16,057
It's just the one -
the Family Martial Arts.

1126
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:22,464
Tell Miranda not to worry.
I won't be interfering anymore.

1127
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:25,266
Well, that's, uh...

1128
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:30,738
That's reassuring.

1129
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:33,074
How long you envision
staying out here?

1130
01:08:33,075 --> 01:08:36,277
I don't rightly know.

1131
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:39,881
Well, if you, uh -
if you have a prolonged stay,

1132
01:08:39,882 --> 01:08:42,016
I could decorate the place
a little bit.

1133
01:08:42,017 --> 01:08:43,084
Curtains, some chairs.

1134
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:50,085
You know, just make it
more comfortable.

1135
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:53,962
Yeah, well,
I appreciate that, Terry,

1136
01:08:53,963 --> 01:09:00,963
but maybe I'll just see
how it goes, okay?

1137
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:15,917
You know, the funny thing is...

1138
01:09:15,918 --> 01:09:18,419
you're standing here

1139
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:23,091
having a polite conversation
with a gay man,

1140
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:28,763
and the world
didn't come to an end.

1141
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:34,769
It's a miracle.

1142
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:52,820
What are you drawin'?

1143
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:56,691
None of your business.

1144
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,526
It's a surprise.

1145
01:09:58,527 --> 01:10:00,094
Oh.

1146
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:06,100
I like surprises.

1147
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:12,073
I, uh...

1148
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:14,776
I have to go back to Boston.

1149
01:10:14,777 --> 01:10:18,713
Tonight.

1150
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:20,982
You're leaving?

1151
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:22,483
Now?

1152
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:23,952
I promise I will be back.

1153
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:29,123
I just...

1154
01:10:29,124 --> 01:10:33,294
Who - who's gonna be
in charge around here?

1155
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:40,295
I miss Sandy.

1156
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:11,559
Come here, you.

1157
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:39,687
When the roll

1158
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:42,223
When the roll is called up yonder
I'll be there

1159
01:12:42,224 --> 01:12:43,658
When the roll

1160
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:46,694
When the roll is called up yonder
I'll be there

1161
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:47,962
When the roll

1162
01:12:47,963 --> 01:12:50,898
When the roll is called up yonder

1163
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:55,336
When the roll is called up yonder
I'll be there

1164
01:12:55,337 --> 01:12:57,605
When the trumpet of the Lord
shall sound

1165
01:12:57,606 --> 01:12:59,374
And time shall be no more

1166
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:03,611
And the morning breaks
eternal, bright, and fair

1167
01:13:03,612 --> 01:13:07,882
When the saved ofEarth shall
gather over on the other shore

1168
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:12,220
And the roll is called up yonder,
I'll be there

1169
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:13,388
When the roll

1170
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:16,023
When the roll is called up yonder
I'll be there

1171
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:17,458
When the roll

1172
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:20,528
When the roll is called up yonder
I'll be there

1173
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:21,729
When the roll

1174
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:24,766
When the roll is called up yonder

1175
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:40,242
When the roll is called up yonder
I'll be there

1176
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:43,551
Would you bring me
that orangy one, Debbie sue?

1177
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:46,888
I think it says "tangerine fantasy"
on the label.

1178
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:49,357
You're not listenin'.

1179
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:51,692
It's now or never, Tom.

1180
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:54,462
You and me -
we're runnin' out of time.

1181
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:57,965
If you can't commit,
I'm gonna take that transfer.

1182
01:13:57,966 --> 01:14:01,068
Region 27.
That's North Dakota, Tom.

1183
01:14:01,069 --> 01:14:03,538
And I won't be back.

1184
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:06,007
Be honest.

1185
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:09,310
Is she ever gonna give you
what I give you?

1186
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:14,449
Tom!

1187
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,617
I want her out of here this minute.

1188
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:19,487
Lucy, that's not very nice.

1189
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:24,459
If that baby-broker bureaucrat's
not gone by the time I open my eyes,

1190
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:30,731
I may be forced to do something
very unchristian.

1191
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:37,732
Git!

1192
01:14:51,286 --> 01:14:54,088
Hey, now, you're breaking
rule number one -

1193
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:55,823
no crying on the drumsticks.

1194
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:57,558
You're watering
down the marinade.

1195
01:14:57,559 --> 01:15:00,027
I know, Lucy.

1196
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:02,930
Come on. Try to hold it
together, okay?

1197
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:05,433
At least till after the baby shower.

1198
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:07,201
You think you can do that?

1199
01:15:07,202 --> 01:15:08,870
Do I have a choice?

1200
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:13,941
No, as far as that goes.

1201
01:15:13,942 --> 01:15:16,310
Your friends are expecting to come

1202
01:15:16,311 --> 01:15:20,314
and share
in your joyous expectation.

1203
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:23,284
Besides, my boys are coming down
from Boston.

1204
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:24,652
They are?

1205
01:15:24,653 --> 01:15:26,187
Oh, come on.
You know Terry.

1206
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:29,190
Your pregnancy is the second,
maybe the third,

1207
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:31,792
most exciting thing
to ever happen to him.

1208
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:33,528
Besides, it's just another
excuse for him

1209
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:37,532
to march on down here
and start issuing orders again.

1210
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:40,234
Is Parker gonna be there?

1211
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:42,270
Yeah, I-I think so.

1212
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:45,873
He's still staying out
in that shed of his.

1213
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:47,375
But...

1214
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:50,611
we have started exchanging
grunts every now and again.

1215
01:15:54,917 --> 01:15:58,986
Oh, Lord.

1216
01:15:58,987 --> 01:16:02,957
What about Debbie sue?

1217
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:05,493
I think I've come up
with a diplomatic way

1218
01:16:05,494 --> 01:16:08,195
of disinviting her.

1219
01:16:08,196 --> 01:16:11,766
Well... Okay, then.

1220
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:16,537
On with the show.

1221
01:16:33,488 --> 01:16:39,460
Oh, my Gosh.
That is so sweet. Thank you.

1222
01:16:39,461 --> 01:16:46,461
Oh, thank you so much.

1223
01:17:19,835 --> 01:17:21,836
- She is?
- Yeah.

1224
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:23,938
Parker, would you excuse us
for one second, please?

1225
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:25,339
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay, thank you.

1226
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:27,475
I'll, uh, catch you later.

1227
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:30,611
I told you we'd have to be
on the lookout for this.

1228
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:37,612
Now aren't you glad
that we're here?

1229
01:17:53,602 --> 01:17:58,272
I know.

1230
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:03,811
I was so sure the Lord would
protect me from these feelings.

1231
01:18:03,812 --> 01:18:05,680
It certainly would be nicer
for all of us

1232
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:08,282
if He was a little bit more
attentive in that regard.

1233
01:18:08,283 --> 01:18:11,719
Miranda, what Terry is saying,

1234
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:15,189
or trying to say if he weren't busy
shooting his mouth off,

1235
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:19,727
is that we understand how hard
it is for you and the baby -

1236
01:18:19,728 --> 01:18:22,763
It's not "the" baby, really, is it?

1237
01:18:22,764 --> 01:18:24,565
I mean, it's our baby.

1238
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:26,634
Huh. I thought I told you
to be quiet.

1239
01:18:26,635 --> 01:18:28,302
I'm sorry.
I'm - I'm just saying.

1240
01:18:28,303 --> 01:18:32,339
Terry and I understand
your bond with our child,

1241
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:36,944
and we love you the more for it.

1242
01:18:36,945 --> 01:18:39,814
Maybe I was a fool to think
that I could live up

1243
01:18:39,815 --> 01:18:43,818
to the expectations
the Lord has for me.

1244
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:46,821
I mean,
it is an interesting point.

1245
01:18:46,822 --> 01:18:49,090
- You did make a sacred oath...
- Shh!

1246
01:18:49,091 --> 01:18:50,958
...with the Lord and to us.

1247
01:18:50,959 --> 01:18:52,793
And I think that's something
we all should consider -

1248
01:18:52,794 --> 01:18:53,828
- Shut up!
- Ooh!

1249
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:57,031
- No!
Ooh, Terry!

1250
01:18:58,467 --> 01:19:00,568
You bitch!

1251
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:01,769
Not you, Miranda.

1252
01:19:05,507 --> 01:19:11,145
We want you to be a part
of his or her life afterwards.

1253
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:13,314
As big a part as you want to be.

1254
01:19:13,315 --> 01:19:16,717
Yes, Miranda, we want you to be
a part of the child's life.

1255
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:20,755
Just under... certain
clearly defined conditions.

1256
01:19:21,556 --> 01:19:24,458
Oh!

1257
01:19:24,459 --> 01:19:27,394
so, you're coming up to Boston
for my dance performance, right?

1258
01:19:27,395 --> 01:19:29,463
Now remind me
when it is again.

1259
01:19:29,464 --> 01:19:33,400
Opening night is in two weeks.

1260
01:19:33,401 --> 01:19:36,370
Okay, promise me I'll see you
there at 7:30 sharp, okay?

1261
01:19:36,371 --> 01:19:40,775
Wild horses couldn't keep me away.

1262
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:41,809
Ooh!

1263
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:45,713
Ooh, I forgot.

1264
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:47,715
You have a good flight.

1265
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:49,016
Bye.

1266
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:56,017
Let's get out of here.

1267
01:20:31,293 --> 01:20:33,894
You - you are perfection.

1268
01:20:33,895 --> 01:20:35,029
Oh.

1269
01:20:42,437 --> 01:20:47,808
Oh, thank you.

1270
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:23,143
Oh, who will come
and go with me?

1271
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:26,280
I am on myjourney home

1272
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:29,550
I'm bound fair Canaan's land...

1273
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:31,518
Lucy?

1274
01:21:31,519 --> 01:21:33,387
I am on myjourney home

1275
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:35,489
Lucy!

1276
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:37,725
Hey, I got this baby table for you!

1277
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:41,996
Oh, come and go with me

1278
01:21:41,997 --> 01:21:43,764
Lucy?

1279
01:21:43,765 --> 01:21:46,133
For I'm on myjourney home

1280
01:21:46,134 --> 01:21:49,403
Like a river in my soul

1281
01:21:49,404 --> 01:21:52,106
Hey. What's -?
What's the matter, girl?

1282
01:21:52,107 --> 01:21:54,508
He's gone, Parker.

1283
01:21:54,509 --> 01:21:55,376
Tom's gone.

1284
01:21:55,377 --> 01:22:00,080
Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1285
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:03,250
Oh.

1286
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:09,089
I got peace like a river

1287
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:12,927
I got peace like a river
in my soul

1288
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:15,095
In my soul

1289
01:22:15,096 --> 01:22:20,534
I got peace like a river

1290
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:26,273
I got peace like a river
in my soul

1291
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:29,243
I got love like an ocean

1292
01:22:29,244 --> 01:22:32,179
I've got love like an ocean

1293
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:36,150
I've got love like an ocean
in my soul

1294
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:37,918
In my soul

1295
01:22:37,919 --> 01:22:40,821
I got love like an ocean

1296
01:22:40,822 --> 01:22:43,724
I've got love like an ocean

1297
01:22:43,725 --> 01:22:49,363
I've got love like an ocean
in my soul

1298
01:22:49,364 --> 01:22:56,364
I've got peace like a river
in my soul

1299
01:22:59,441 --> 01:23:06,441
Peace like a river
in my soul

1300
01:23:28,803 --> 01:23:30,604
Terry.

1301
01:23:30,605 --> 01:23:35,476
But that was just
the most beautiful thing.

1302
01:23:35,477 --> 01:23:40,814
I think I saw the divine spark
up there on that stage.

1303
01:23:40,815 --> 01:23:44,852
He's a genius, huh?

1304
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:47,488
Oh!

1305
01:23:48,656 --> 01:23:50,691
Miranda!

1306
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:52,526
What happened?

1307
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:55,062
Out of the way!

1308
01:23:55,063 --> 01:23:58,432
Call 911!

1309
01:24:01,236 --> 01:24:03,070
Call 911!
Take this phone!

1310
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:05,806
somebody get help now!

1311
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:14,314
It was a girl.

1312
01:24:14,315 --> 01:24:15,082
she...

1313
01:24:18,119 --> 01:24:21,455
The E.R. Chief
said that she, um -

1314
01:24:21,456 --> 01:24:27,361
she wouldn't have survived,
even if you had gone to term.

1315
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:33,033
What?

1316
01:25:27,589 --> 01:25:34,027
I'm so sorry.

1317
01:25:34,028 --> 01:25:38,799
Parker, I let my guys down.

1318
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:42,136
I guess I just didn't pray
hard enough.

1319
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:44,705
Oh, no. Oh, nonsense, dear.

1320
01:25:44,706 --> 01:25:50,043
she was very brave.

1321
01:25:50,044 --> 01:25:54,882
Parker, this is a wonderful woman.

1322
01:25:54,883 --> 01:25:57,618
I hope you appreciate
how lucky you are.

1323
01:25:57,619 --> 01:26:04,619
I'm - I'm tryin', Terry.
I'm tryin' just as hard as I can.

1324
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:07,461
I'm gonna -
I'm gonna take care of you.

1325
01:26:07,462 --> 01:26:12,599
I'm gonna take care of us, okay?

1326
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:16,103
If you'll let me.

1327
01:26:16,104 --> 01:26:23,104
Yeah?

1328
01:26:28,383 --> 01:26:31,885
Oh, who will come and go
with me?

1329
01:26:31,886 --> 01:26:34,855
I am on myjourney home

1330
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:38,892
I'm bound fair Canaan's land

1331
01:26:38,893 --> 01:26:42,930
I'm afraid the bad news
is coming in clumps these days.

1332
01:26:42,931 --> 01:26:45,799
Parker?

1333
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:48,202
Tom, your sister's husband,
he done run off

1334
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:52,005
with that Destiny's Children woman -
Debbie sue.

1335
01:26:52,006 --> 01:26:54,141
says he's gonna divorce Lucy.

1336
01:26:54,142 --> 01:26:55,375
Oh, my Lord!

1337
01:26:55,376 --> 01:26:58,478
I want them out now!

1338
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:01,682
They've been implanted in me
by Debbie sue Dawson,

1339
01:27:01,683 --> 01:27:03,417
an agent of satan!

1340
01:27:03,418 --> 01:27:05,052
- Lucy -
- I will not!

1341
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:08,155
I cannot bear these seeds
of the devil!

1342
01:27:08,156 --> 01:27:09,856
Lucy, calm down, okay?

1343
01:27:09,857 --> 01:27:12,626
Lord, help me!

1344
01:27:12,627 --> 01:27:13,427
Aah!

1345
01:27:13,428 --> 01:27:15,862
Please, Lord!

1346
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:22,836
Sandy!

1347
01:27:22,837 --> 01:27:26,073
The devil - he's here!

1348
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:29,243
The evil one, he's come
to collect his children.

1349
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:30,711
- Just breathe.
- We're gonna get you to a hospital.

1350
01:27:30,712 --> 01:27:34,982
- No! Oh, they're here! They're here!
- Come on.

1351
01:27:34,983 --> 01:27:36,183
Oh, they're here!

1352
01:27:36,184 --> 01:27:37,651
Aah!

1353
01:27:37,652 --> 01:27:42,723
Oh, Miranda! Please, Lord!

1354
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:49,830
Look at you.

1355
01:27:49,831 --> 01:27:53,967
so beautiful. Look at you.

1356
01:27:53,968 --> 01:27:59,606
Everything looks really good.

1357
01:27:59,607 --> 01:28:01,642
Well, little lady, you did it.

1358
01:28:01,643 --> 01:28:04,745
It was a very special delivery here.

1359
01:28:10,351 --> 01:28:17,351
Get - get -
get them away from me.

1360
01:28:29,337 --> 01:28:33,407
In granting this adoption today,
I am pleased,

1361
01:28:33,408 --> 01:28:38,879
though a little surprised, frankly,
to be making history in this state.

1362
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:44,184
I live and I learn and am pleased
to be that old dog

1363
01:28:44,185 --> 01:28:47,988
who can occasionally manage
to master a new trick.

1364
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:51,425
Times change,
and enlightened thinking

1365
01:28:51,426 --> 01:28:53,760
sometimes reaches
into strange corners

1366
01:28:53,761 --> 01:28:57,531
that we were not smart enough
to anticipate in the past.

1367
01:28:57,532 --> 01:28:59,566
Although...

1368
01:28:59,567 --> 01:29:03,036
the circumstances
of the dissolution of one family

1369
01:29:03,037 --> 01:29:06,139
are always tragic,

1370
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:09,976
we know that these children are
being welcomed with open arms

1371
01:29:09,977 --> 01:29:15,182
and great love by the
Mr. Price-Owens one and two.

1372
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:19,353
Good luck to your new
American family, gentlemen.

1373
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:25,158
I got peace like a river

1374
01:29:25,159 --> 01:29:28,895
I got peace like a river
in my soul

1375
01:29:28,896 --> 01:29:30,997
In my soul

1376
01:29:30,998 --> 01:29:36,737
I got peace like a river

1377
01:29:36,738 --> 01:29:41,441
I got peace like a river
in my soul

1378
01:29:41,442 --> 01:29:44,745
Just wait. Just hold on.

1379
01:29:44,746 --> 01:29:46,279
I can't feel anything.

1380
01:29:48,783 --> 01:29:49,883
You can't feel that?

1381
01:29:49,884 --> 01:29:52,452
You sure our baby's in there?

1382
01:29:52,453 --> 01:29:54,287
I'm pretty sure he's in there.

1383
01:29:54,288 --> 01:29:57,391
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1384
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:59,226
- Did you feel that?
- Yeah.

1385
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:00,994
You did?

1386
01:30:04,165 --> 01:30:05,632
Thank you, Lord.

1387
01:30:05,633 --> 01:30:12,633
I've got peace like a river
in my soul

1388
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:29,990
Once when I was a child
I cried because I'd lost my way

1389
01:30:29,991 --> 01:30:31,992
Then I heard a voice inside...

1390
01:30:31,993 --> 01:30:33,560
Albert?

1391
01:30:33,561 --> 01:30:38,331
Why don't you try one of
my little ol' peach muffins?

1392
01:30:38,332 --> 01:30:40,567
Why, sure.

1393
01:30:40,568 --> 01:30:42,102
Uh...

1394
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:44,805
Lucy, thank you so much.

1395
01:30:44,806 --> 01:30:48,575
Yeah, I think you'll find it
quite tasty.

1396
01:30:48,576 --> 01:30:51,211
And, Albert, the wonderful thing
about these muffins

1397
01:30:51,212 --> 01:30:53,914
is they're made mainly from
ingredients that were around

1398
01:30:53,915 --> 01:30:59,820
when the Bible
was first set down on paper.

1399
01:30:59,821 --> 01:31:00,454
Mmm.

1400
01:31:05,493 --> 01:31:06,993
Thank you.

1401
01:31:06,994 --> 01:31:08,061
They're so good.

1402
01:31:11,365 --> 01:31:19,306
Don't look now,
the Lord is comin'

1403
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:21,942
Comin' to guide you home

1404
01:31:21,943 --> 01:31:29,783
Don't be sad
'cause He'll be singin'

1405
01:31:29,784 --> 01:31:32,652
Songs to guide you home

1406
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:40,694
Don't look now,
the Lord is comin'

1407
01:31:40,695 --> 01:31:42,295
Comin' to guide you home

1408
01:31:42,296 --> 01:31:43,563
Don't be sad

1409
01:31:43,564 --> 01:31:51,371
Don't be sad
'cause He'll be singin'

1410
01:31:51,372 --> 01:31:56,276
Songs to guide you home

1411
01:31:56,277 --> 01:32:03,277
He'll be comin'
to guide you home

1412
01:32:06,087 --> 01:32:10,790
When the Lord calls my name

1413
01:32:10,791 --> 01:32:15,562
I will stand
and I'll hold my head up high

1414
01:32:15,563 --> 01:32:20,400
There'll be no cause for shame

1415
01:32:20,401 --> 01:32:25,171
When I'm called to the Lord,
then I will fly

1416
01:32:25,172 --> 01:32:30,010
I will fly

1417
01:32:30,011 --> 01:32:34,714
I will fly like an angel
to the Lord

1418
01:32:34,715 --> 01:32:39,619
I will fly

1419
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:45,425
I will fly like an angel
to the Lord

1420
01:32:45,426 --> 01:32:48,662
There's not a friend
like the lowly Jesus

1421
01:32:48,663 --> 01:32:51,798
No, not one

1422
01:32:51,799 --> 01:32:55,068
None else could heal
all our souls'diseases

1423
01:32:55,069 --> 01:32:58,271
No, not one

1424
01:32:58,272 --> 01:33:01,408
Jesus knows
all about our struggles

1425
01:33:01,409 --> 01:33:04,644
He will guide
till the day is done

1426
01:33:04,645 --> 01:33:07,881
There's not a friend
like the lowly Jesus

1427
01:33:07,882 --> 01:33:20,293
No, not one

1428
01:33:43,184 --> 01:33:47,153
Great God,
attend while zion sings

1429
01:33:47,154 --> 01:33:50,423
Thejoy that
from Thy presence springs

1430
01:33:50,424 --> 01:34:02,402
To spend one day
with Thee on Earth

1431
01:34:02,403 --> 01:34:09,403
Exceeds a thousand days
ofmirth

1432
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:15,315
Farewell, my friends

1433
01:34:15,316 --> 01:34:20,086
I'm bound for Canaan

1434
01:34:20,087 --> 01:34:27,087
I'm travelin'
through the wilderness

1435
01:34:27,395 --> 01:34:34,395
Your company
has been delightful

1436
01:34:34,535 --> 01:34:41,535
You who doth leave
my mind distressed

1437
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:49,510
I go away behind to leave you

1438
01:34:50,117 --> 01:34:57,117
Perhaps never to meet again

1439
01:34:58,192 --> 01:35:05,192
But if we never
have that pleasure

1440
01:35:05,833 --> 01:35:12,833
I hope we'll meet
on Canaan's land

1441
01:35:13,074 --> 01:35:20,074
But if we never
have that pleasure

1442
01:35:20,848 --> 01:35:27,848
I hope we'll meet
on Canaan's land
