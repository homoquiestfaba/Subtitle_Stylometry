1
00:00:02,361 --> 00:00:06,121
I know it's hard, Chelsey.
You have to push it hard again.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,961
Just a little, but it will be over.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,160
There it is. You did it.

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,080
Time of death: 22. 18.

5
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,240
I want to see her.

6
00:00:56,561 --> 00:00:59,621
UKEDEN OTROK

7
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,400
The studio is wonderful. -Yeah.
They finished it six months ago.

8
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,760
Will you really go home?
I can drive you.

9
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,200
It's just a few streets.
Walking will benefit me.

10
00:01:22,841 --> 00:01:26,640
Are you evaluating tasks today?
-All day. The Bruce are the worst.

11
00:01:27,561 --> 00:01:30,721
How do they come to fax if they
do not know how to use commas?

12
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,200
Go create a young
mind, Professor King.

13
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:40,001
I love you. -Me too.
- I love you, Johnny. Enjoy.

14
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,800
It's in the first quarter.
- It seems so.

15
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:15,080
I have a deadline on April 20.
- On April 15th! -Res? It's so close.

16
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,161
You're pregnant for 10 weeks.
How do you know you're wearing a son?

17
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,480
I'm sorry, I do not want to stick,

18
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,480
I heard your husband
call him Johnny.

19
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,040
Our joke.
You know how in the books

20
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:31,721
compare the size of the baby
with fruit or vegetables?

21
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,600
Days 38 and 39 are
squash and watermelon.

22
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,721
I'm trying to forget that.

23
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,240
In the fifth week, we
officially confirmed pregnancy.

24
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,561
In the book we read that the
child is as big as an apple pie.

25
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,961
Hearty. I like it.
-Diane. -Chelsey.

26
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:55,961
Girls, let's start.
I see new faces.

27
00:02:57,161 --> 00:02:59,800
If you have any
questions, please select.

28
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,441
This course prepares you

29
00:03:02,721 --> 00:03:06,281
on a miraculous journey
waiting for future moments.

30
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,681
Put the soles together
for the start.

31
00:03:14,721 --> 00:03:16,961
What brought you to Pineville?

32
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,480
My husband Rob teaches English
literature at the university.

33
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:25,640
He's got a great job.
- Do you also lecture?

34
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:31,721
Yes, and instead of Emily
Dickinson and G. B. Shawa

35
00:03:31,881 --> 00:03:35,600
my children are reading <i> Hat with a hat</i>
and <i> Night, month.</i>

36
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:42,161
I'm in kindergarten.
- It's a bit exciting. You see the future.

37
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:49,640
Yeah. It's full of juice, glue
and always unbuttoned shoes.

38
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:55,240
Is your husband so happy
with parenthood like you?

39
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,681
I'm sorry, I'm asking too much.
-It's okay. We're not together.

40
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,841
I'm sorry.

41
00:04:11,161 --> 00:04:14,360
We had problems.

42
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,440
In one year, I had
three abortions.

43
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:22,761
Jesse, my husband,
wanted to quit.

44
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:30,560
He hurt him too much when
he dared, then gave up.

45
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,920
All the time, we argued.

46
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,441
I think he'll be happy when I tell him.
- This requires courage. - Yeah?

47
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,641
Of course.

48
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,040
If you do not expect anything,
you can not be disappointed.

49
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:48,240
But hope requires courage.
-I hope.

50
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,401
I dream about my family.

51
00:04:55,521 --> 00:04:58,880
I'll make that dream come true.
- So you're a good mom.

52
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:03,040
Thank you.

53
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,761
Jesse?

54
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,961
Just a moment.

55
00:05:23,961 --> 00:05:28,880
Chelsey, what are you doing here?
- It's nice to see you, too.

56
00:05:29,641 --> 00:05:32,281
I'm sorry, I did not expect you.

57
00:05:34,081 --> 00:05:36,040
An interesting word choice.

58
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,441
I expect the children. I'm pregnant.
Ten weeks.

59
00:05:46,641 --> 00:05:48,600
There you were.
You should know.

60
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:53,000
Only once, since I moved out.
- One more time.

61
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,480
Did you do it on purpose?

62
00:05:56,761 --> 00:06:01,401
Did you want me to come back to me?
It would be stupid.

63
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,761
Chels, it's not like that.

64
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,680
But that's not good.
The doctor says it's dangerous.

65
00:06:12,761 --> 00:06:15,480
He did not expect pregnancy,
it's not the same.

66
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,841
I can not do it anymore.
I told you.

67
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,240
I could be happy too, but
that's not enough for you.

68
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,321
Nothing has changed.
- It's all.

69
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:31,281
We're not just the two of us.

70
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,000
We'll be three.

71
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,521
I would like to believe that.

72
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,401
I'm sorry, it's too
much for me right now.

73
00:06:46,441 --> 00:06:51,800
I need time.
- Right.

74
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:54,800
Talk to you.

75
00:07:22,961 --> 00:07:24,961
Yoga really takes three hours?

76
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,240
One hour, but I went to
lunch with my new friend.

77
00:07:29,521 --> 00:07:31,961
Chelsey, she would give
birth a week after me.

78
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:37,321
Great, you have a pregnant friend.
-Yeah. Still coffee? -Thank you.

79
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,641
Good afternoon, "Real Estate
Goehring-Oland". Who are you looking for?

80
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:46,321
Of course, just a moment.

81
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:52,841
Hello! Welcome to Pineville.
-Thank you. -I am pleased. -Me too.

82
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:54,880
It's nice to meet you too.

83
00:07:57,521 --> 00:08:03,440
They need at least two bedrooms.
-Three.

84
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,040
When do you have a deadline? -5. March.
- It's late April. - Congratulations!

85
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:13,841
I know a great gynecologist; on Saturday
I go to yoga for pregnant women.

86
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,360
Fantastic, thank you. - Let's see
what you need before you are born.

87
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,040
Great, thank you.

88
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,401
Would you like to buy shoes? I need a break,
as long as the twins are in kindergarten.

89
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,360
I can not, I'm going to Chelsea with
a cosmetician. - Who's Chelsey?

90
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,240
Nice girl, I met her on yoga.
You can go with us,

91
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:40,240
but we go to a salon where only
natural peels and creams are used.

92
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,000
It's twice as expensive.
- Make a robbery.

93
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,360
Chelsey walks into a regular salon.

94
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,961
She thinks chemicals
can harm the baby.

95
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,201
Is this her first child? -Yeah.

96
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,240
Books and blogs are
full of warnings

97
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,441
on countless harmful effects on
the child before and after birth.

98
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,841
When you're born, you learn
believe in your own sense.

99
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:09,000
Get rid of the dirt
and spend the day.

100
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,520
That's why I need you.
You've broken the path.

101
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,760
And you have pregnant suits that I
can borrow. - I'll look for them.

102
00:09:18,681 --> 00:09:22,280
That's fun. See yoga on Saturday?
-Yeah.

103
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,400
What are you doing this weekend? Would you like to
watch a movie for women who are not interested in men?

104
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,441
On Friday, Terry and Paula and kids
are having dinner. Come on, come on.

105
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,681
I do not want to disturb you. - You will not.
Come on, it's gonna be fun. - Right.

106
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,801
Great. See you at 18.
- Anything I bring? - Ego.

107
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:46,880
My car. See you on Friday.
-Honey.

108
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,801
"Do you have dinner time?"

109
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,801
Chels, I'm sorry
to hear the news.

110
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:21,360
I do not know what all this means for us.
We have a lot of problems.

111
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,161
I know.

112
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,880
But I want to be with you.
I'm going with you to the reviews.

113
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:36,600
We'll see how it goes.

114
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:43,201
Jesse, at week 12, we're.
This is the end of the first quarter.

115
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,681
This is important. The last three
times we did not come this far.

116
00:10:48,321 --> 00:10:52,120
We spent the first time
eight months and a half.

117
00:10:56,801 --> 00:10:58,441
This time it will not be so.

118
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,721
I know it will not.

119
00:12:00,841 --> 00:12:01,921
No …

120
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,081
No, no, no, no, no.

121
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,801
No.

122
00:12:36,961 --> 00:12:39,801
Purple and pink turtle?
Cool.

123
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:45,760
Di, tell me you'll jump around my
kids even when you have your own.

124
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,280
I do not know why not.

125
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,801
Is it okay to come?
We are not invited both.

126
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:59,120
It's a dinner for couples, family.
I do not want to be alone. - I know, but...

127
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,201
You said you would do everything
for me during pregnancy.

128
00:13:05,561 --> 00:13:08,760
I need that.

129
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,561
Fine.

130
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,280
Come on.

131
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,041
Sorry, we missed the house.

132
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,600
No, I'm Paul. Come in.
-I am pleased. -Enako.

133
00:13:34,561 --> 00:13:37,640
Welcome. -Thank you.
- And flowers!

134
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,400
Di! Your friends came in.
- They're alive.

135
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,561
Diane, this is my husband, Jesse.

136
00:13:45,921 --> 00:13:49,600
I hope it's okay for me to come.
-Great! Welcome.

137
00:13:49,681 --> 00:13:53,561
You said I should not bring anything,
but I can not get empty hands.

138
00:13:54,321 --> 00:13:55,721
I put something together.

139
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,801
When I do it, it's
usually from a delicacy.

140
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,240
This is our favorite cake.
Chocolate chocolate... Chocolate!

141
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,400
Peanut butter.
It's delicious.

142
00:14:10,441 --> 00:14:13,880
It's official. My child now
wants to live with you.

143
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:19,961
Diane says you got it
a week's time for her.

144
00:14:20,201 --> 00:14:22,520
Yeah. -Super, we met.

145
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:27,000
Together we will have an important
event together. It's exciting.

146
00:14:27,081 --> 00:14:31,081
I agree. I think it was a fate.

147
00:14:32,841 --> 00:14:34,921
I was convinced that I met you.

148
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,801
They are certainly very
happy to have a twin.

149
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,081
Not always. Sometimes it's like
living with little spouses.

150
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,961
Are your twin boys in your family?

151
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,880
If you are being treated for infertility,
they are. - We're really discovering.

152
00:14:51,961 --> 00:14:55,921
Nature gave us no family,
and we turned to science.

153
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,480
Our best decision.

154
00:14:58,841 --> 00:15:05,081
You guys understand. If you want a family,
you have to be persistent, do everything.

155
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:16,760
The knife is in the drawer.

156
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,081
Thank you.

157
00:15:23,321 --> 00:15:30,081
You brought Jesse. - I know.
I'm sorry I did not tell you before.

158
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:36,081
Stop it, I'm glad for you. You
told him you were pregnant. -Yeah.

159
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,120
Maybe they'll set off.

160
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,321
We will not hurry.

161
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:46,801
There's nothing wrong with that.

162
00:15:49,201 --> 00:15:51,921
Will you put them in the machine?
-My pleasure.

163
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,040
That's exactly what I wanted.

164
00:15:56,441 --> 00:15:59,681
Cake looks great.
-Thank you.

165
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,000
I felt it kicking.

166
00:16:07,921 --> 00:16:10,721
You good? -Yeah.

167
00:16:13,961 --> 00:16:16,161
They really have a
perfect life, right?

168
00:16:23,681 --> 00:16:27,400
Who's for the cake?
-All! -Yeah!

169
00:16:28,081 --> 00:16:31,360
Half is for me.
- It's half for you.

170
00:16:48,561 --> 00:16:51,561
Hi, darling.

171
00:16:54,441 --> 00:16:58,681
Excuse me. - I think that's what
happened to her. -Thank you.

172
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,520
We have to keep
the mum together.

173
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,520
Hello! -I'm sorry I'm late. You?

174
00:17:09,721 --> 00:17:15,080
Did you see her carriage?
- It's nice. - The latest technology.

175
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,000
More advanced and more
expensive than my first car.

176
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:24,560
It's really fun to buy for a baby.
- It's more cunning when it's smaller.

177
00:17:26,161 --> 00:17:28,560
We were here for the first time.

178
00:17:29,641 --> 00:17:34,961
Let's get moving. I did not eat and cough
for half an hour, but I have both.

179
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:47,641
I ordered you tea and lime pie.
-Thank you.

180
00:17:48,161 --> 00:17:52,280
Show me everything you bought.
I was not careful.

181
00:17:56,401 --> 00:17:57,961
Very cute!

182
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,280
If you had your gender shade, you
would not buy yellow and green.

183
00:18:03,721 --> 00:18:05,800
I know she's a girl.

184
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,601
And unlike me and my mom

185
00:18:08,961 --> 00:18:11,161
we will be the best friend.

186
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,401
You and Mom are not close?
- It hides me that Dad left us.

187
00:18:17,361 --> 00:18:22,000
He did not want children. When she became
pregnant, she was no longer wanted.

188
00:18:23,721 --> 00:18:29,280
She was not the best mom. She's been drinking too
much, the invitations of the guy live to us.

189
00:18:30,721 --> 00:18:34,320
Let's say that many of them
were not cavaliers. -I'm sorry.

190
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:37,641
It sounds like a difficult childhood.
-It's okay.

191
00:18:38,441 --> 00:18:42,240
She taught me what I should not do.
This is also something.

192
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,240
Whatever will be
with me and Jesse,

193
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,240
most of all, I mean, I'm a good mom.
- You will. I do not doubt.

194
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,240
I'm glad you think so.
I really appreciate your opinion.

195
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:02,040
There are enough serious topics,
it's time for the cats.

196
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,601
Very cute!

197
00:19:07,721 --> 00:19:11,721
What is it?
"Totally natural birth"?

198
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,721
I did not think you wanted
give birth home. -Why not?

199
00:19:17,681 --> 00:19:21,280
According to your experience

200
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:27,961
I conclude that you want to be in the
hospital if something goes wrong.

201
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:30,441
Our bodies are created for this.

202
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,320
Pregnancy is a natural condition.

203
00:19:34,721 --> 00:19:36,721
Women already have
the same eternity.

204
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,401
They were born in the fields.
We do not need modern rubbish.

205
00:19:44,201 --> 00:19:47,601
Except for being so cute.
- Other than that.

206
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,560
Rob! - I'm here!

207
00:19:57,161 --> 00:19:59,721
Dinner is on the way.
I ordered a pizza.

208
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,800
Are you so happy about the pizza?

209
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,401
I am so grateful for our life.
I was Chelsey.

210
00:20:12,721 --> 00:20:18,161
It's good? It's unremarkable.
The most tough guy I know.

211
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,760
She had a hard life.
She's finally wearing a lot of rafts.

212
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,560
But Jesse's not together and...

213
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,401
I do not know how it works. I'm
so happy for what we have.

214
00:20:33,961 --> 00:20:35,000
Dear.

215
00:21:34,641 --> 00:21:38,040
They're alive. Not that.
This is for a short-term lease.

216
00:21:42,441 --> 00:21:44,080
Damage. She is beautiful.

217
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,721
I'm advertising her too.
Want to look at her?

218
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:52,961
Of course. -Pridita.

219
00:22:02,961 --> 00:22:05,121
The owner is a professor at college.

220
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,201
Last week he took a
free academic year.

221
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,840
We just made an ad.

222
00:22:11,361 --> 00:22:15,000
Kitchen and large living room.

223
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:23,080
Above there are three bedrooms,
two bathrooms and a toilet.

224
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,121
It's just a few steps.

225
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,520
That's why it's unique.

226
00:22:29,441 --> 00:22:35,240
Wood, antique tub and dome.

227
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:46,681
Chelsey, it's beautiful. Tell
me you have a similar sales.

228
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,681
It's really perfect.

229
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,881
Let's go see another house.

230
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,361
Where are you going?

231
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,641
Chelsey?

232
00:23:18,401 --> 00:23:22,441
I came to visit Diana, but
I saw that she had a job.

233
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,961
We're about to end in two hours.

234
00:23:26,601 --> 00:23:30,080
Tell her I was here
to call her later.

235
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,921
Nice to see you, Paula.

236
00:23:49,441 --> 00:23:53,760
What is? - Nothing. Le...

237
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,601
I saw Chelsey today.
- Where? -Tu.

238
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,121
She watched the children
on the playground.

239
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,681
She said she came to you, but I
do not know... It was strange.

240
00:24:04,881 --> 00:24:09,040
Agent for real estate is.
She probably showed up some kind of house.

241
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,681
Are you fixing glue?
- Of course. -Thank you.

242
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:18,800
Is everything all right?
You want to talk about what?

243
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,121
No. I'm going after the glue.

244
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,121
Thank you.

245
00:24:31,121 --> 00:24:35,161
Someone offered 2000 more.
What are you going to do?

246
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,881
Talk to me and call
me in the evening.

247
00:24:42,161 --> 00:24:46,320
This woman called. She is very interested
in Goldman's house on Rose Avenue.

248
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,480
Thank you.

249
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,480
They're alive. -Jesse,
what are you doing here?

250
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,320
We're going to the check.
- What? - For inspection.

251
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,201
I said I want to go with you.

252
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:32,401
You said you had a meeting.
- I put it down. That's more important.

253
00:25:41,681 --> 00:25:42,721
Let's go.

254
00:25:51,881 --> 00:25:54,121
You can not get our private
life into the job.

255
00:25:54,201 --> 00:25:58,560
What do you want from me? You were angry
when I was not sure about the baby,

256
00:25:58,681 --> 00:26:02,560
now you're angry that I want to
be involved. - It's always yours.

257
00:26:02,921 --> 00:26:05,840
You gave up on our law, not me.

258
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,080
I wanted to fight for us.
For our family. - I know.

259
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:13,401
I want to have what we
had before, if possible.

260
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:18,441
I want to redeem.
- Thanks, but...

261
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,361
Now it has to be mine.

262
00:26:22,641 --> 00:26:25,840
If I want you to go to the
check, I'll invite you.

263
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,121
Right. But I would like to do what
is right for you and your child.

264
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:36,800
I want you to let me do it.
I know, believe it. Your conditions.

265
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:43,320
Yeah. I'd rather go, I'll miss.

266
00:26:43,641 --> 00:26:46,000
You really do not want me to go with you?
-Res.

267
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,320
I'll let you know how it went.

268
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,641
Fine. Good.

269
00:26:56,641 --> 00:26:57,760
Bye.

270
00:28:18,921 --> 00:28:23,240
Jesse, I'm sorry I did
not call you before.

271
00:28:24,401 --> 00:28:25,760
I had work.

272
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,961
Everything is fine.

273
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,760
A healthy child grows in me.

274
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,760
I'll call you later.

275
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,480
Not bad, Mom. Not bad.

276
00:30:25,121 --> 00:30:29,681
"Hello, you got Diane King.
Leave the message. "

277
00:30:42,161 --> 00:30:45,921
They're alive. Happy New Year.
-Enako.

278
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,520
Overnight, you expanded.
-It's happening.

279
00:30:52,201 --> 00:30:54,721
We did not see you for a few weeks.

280
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:00,000
I know, I'm sorry. For the
holidays, we had guests,

281
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,601
but we were not here for the New Year.
I just could not wait to see you.

282
00:31:04,961 --> 00:31:07,961
I want to see your expression
when you hear the news.

283
00:31:08,641 --> 00:31:10,721
I was on amniocentesis.

284
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,320
I'm a kid.
-Fantka?

285
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,040
Maybe he will fall in love with
your daughter and we'll be in love!

286
00:31:18,121 --> 00:31:20,800
Chels, I'm just kidding.

287
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,961
It's not that. I was
also on amniocentesis.

288
00:31:26,601 --> 00:31:29,401
I also have a boyfriend.
-Res?

289
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,441
Does not bother you?
You wanted a girl.

290
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,000
No. They say that boys
love their mothers.

291
00:31:38,921 --> 00:31:43,800
I'd rather think about it than
how they rage and get beat.

292
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,441
You good?
-Brca. You want to feel it?

293
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,000
Amazing, what?

294
00:31:59,401 --> 00:32:01,760
Let's start.

295
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,961
First adapted position "tree".

296
00:32:06,441 --> 00:32:08,121
Step in front of the pillow.

297
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,921
Let's spread our hands to
the sky, breathe deeply.

298
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,961
"A little sad boy,

299
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,040
blow into the trumpet,

300
00:33:01,601 --> 00:33:04,201
sheep are in the meadow,

301
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,441
cows in corn.

302
00:33:09,881 --> 00:33:12,441
Where is this boy,

303
00:33:13,641 --> 00:33:16,201
who keeps the sheep?

304
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,601
It's in the shade,

305
00:33:21,961 --> 00:33:24,560
sleeping firmly?

306
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,881
Will you wake him up?

307
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:33,000
I do not.

308
00:33:34,881 --> 00:33:37,800
If I wake him up,

309
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,721
he will cry. "

310
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,400
Enter what is domestic.

311
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,400
Vivian, take it.
I'll see you in there. Thank you.

312
00:34:45,201 --> 00:34:49,561
Chelsey? What are you doing?
-Jaz...

313
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:55,880
You see the house?
-No. Le...

314
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:00,880
Chelsey? You good?
Did something happen?

315
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,960
I am very sorry.
With Jesse, we went badly.

316
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:11,681
I wanted to talk to someone
who cares about me.

317
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,320
I saw you had a party, I did not mean
to disturb you. - Not at all. Come in.

318
00:35:22,561 --> 00:35:24,920
I'm going to the game.
Chelsey.

319
00:35:26,721 --> 00:35:29,880
All right?
- We'll talk about how naughty boys are.

320
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,360
Then I'll go.
Have fun.

321
00:35:33,721 --> 00:35:37,920
I'm very embarrassed. -No! - You should
not be here. - Do not be embarrassed.

322
00:35:38,081 --> 00:35:40,960
This is our tradition.
Thematic dinner.

323
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:42,440
Tonight, it's Mexican.

324
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:45,041
I'm breaking the tradition!

325
00:35:45,201 --> 00:35:50,880
Stop it. I know them years.
You know Paulo. Vivian works with us.

326
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:55,001
I know the others from the fax.
Tell me what happened.

327
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,081
With Jesse, we got into a lot of trouble.

328
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,161
It does not have to be with a kid.
Take a look at me at night.

329
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,641
I finally realized that
I was completely alone.

330
00:36:08,121 --> 00:36:09,161
I am very sorry.

331
00:36:10,121 --> 00:36:11,920
I'm sorry, that's stupid.

332
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,320
They're alive.

333
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,400
You have to tell her something.

334
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:29,081
Di, can we talk?
- Of course. - It's gone last night.

335
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:36,161
Poor Chelsey.
- I did not think so. -What do you mean?

336
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:40,240
Di, I'm sorry for
her legal problems,

337
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,681
But did she not behave humbly?
She needed a friend.

338
00:36:45,201 --> 00:36:48,081
There are not many
people to rely on.

339
00:36:48,201 --> 00:36:52,681
Okay, but with Vivian we
caught her watching the house.

340
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,481
Di, come on! This is scary and not
the first. - She explained why.

341
00:36:58,641 --> 00:37:02,721
She could not call? -Who comes
in without notice and uninvited?

342
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,400
I do not know. Perhaps, too, you
would not behave perfectly,

343
00:37:06,521 --> 00:37:09,081
if you were pregnant
when your law broke up.

344
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:13,840
I'm sorry. I was just looking
forward to our gathering.

345
00:37:14,001 --> 00:37:17,840
I did not expect to talk about
Chelsea's legal problems.

346
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,561
My Chelsey help will not
affect our friendship.

347
00:37:20,641 --> 00:37:22,681
You know that, right?
- Of course.

348
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,481
Good. - Sure.

349
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,521
Look at him.
-Res is unclean.

350
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:43,721
He does not see anything about
it, which is a diaphragm.

351
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,400
Muscles under the lungs.

352
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:50,840
It's a congenital
diaphragmatic hernia.

353
00:37:51,161 --> 00:37:56,800
What is it?
- Hole on the diaphragm.

354
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,481
A hole?

355
00:37:58,641 --> 00:38:04,400
If it is not operated, other organs
in the abdomen may press the lungs.

356
00:38:04,561 --> 00:38:07,960
They will not develop well and the child
will not be able to breathe properly.

357
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:13,920
Oh, God.
- Diane, Rob, that can be fixed. - How?

358
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,561
We will arrange for the Caesarean section
to know exactly the date of birth.

359
00:38:18,681 --> 00:38:22,360
Specialists will be at birth.

360
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,601
They will put the baby on the respirator
to make it easier to breathe,

361
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:31,320
then it was quickly operated.

362
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,440
I will not lie to you.

363
00:38:33,641 --> 00:38:37,840
You will come to check
up until his third year.

364
00:38:38,561 --> 00:38:40,800
And there may be complications.

365
00:38:41,641 --> 00:38:45,201
But luckily, our colleagues
are good at our work.

366
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:52,001
I promise that they are very
likely to have a healthy baby.

367
00:39:11,481 --> 00:39:16,041
"Hello, you got Diane King.
Leave the message. "

368
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,201
Here, Chels.
I just want to greet you.

369
00:39:20,721 --> 00:39:25,081
I think you were under review today.
How was it?

370
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,121
Call me.

371
00:39:39,121 --> 00:39:43,641
Here prof. King. I have to
cancel the afternoon lectures.

372
00:39:47,201 --> 00:39:51,360
And tomorrow. Yeah.
All right, thank you.

373
00:39:52,001 --> 00:39:53,081
Here you go, dear.

374
00:40:00,601 --> 00:40:05,760
We'll get it.
- I can not feel that way. - You did not.

375
00:40:06,681 --> 00:40:08,721
Your work is more
important than ever.

376
00:40:09,681 --> 00:40:15,360
You have to eat properly and feel that your
child will be as powerful as possible.

377
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,280
I very much like you and your little
Johnny. Everything will be okay.

378
00:40:22,201 --> 00:40:23,400
I know that.

379
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,920
Are we really going
to call him Johnny?

380
00:40:38,001 --> 00:40:40,521
I can not talk to Chelsey now.

381
00:40:41,161 --> 00:40:42,240
I feel bad,

382
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,721
but it reminds me of everything
that can go wrong in pregnancy.

383
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,240
Is that why I'm a terrifying man?

384
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,760
Of course you did not. You only
know her for a few months.

385
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,201
If I'm honest, she's
very emotional.

386
00:40:57,601 --> 00:41:03,240
Attend yourself and your child.
Forget Chelsea.

387
00:41:23,721 --> 00:41:26,121
"Hello, stranger. How are you?"

388
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:34,121
Great, thank you.

389
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,081
Are you ready to bid for
that house on Swinton?

390
00:41:47,481 --> 00:41:53,280
Good. If they accept your offer
and do not sell the houses,

391
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,320
you can rent it from
the owner at Swinton.

392
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:58,721
So you will not
have two mortgages.

393
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,960
Someone interested?

394
00:42:04,641 --> 00:42:05,721
What's the address?

395
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:15,481
I'll look at what's available.
Bye, Nicole.

396
00:42:50,641 --> 00:42:52,840
Everything is agreed
for Saturday 15th.

397
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,201
Rob will take Diana to a
special pre-natal massage.

398
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,081
Relaxed and happy will come
home to friends and family

399
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:00,161
to the surprise
party for a child.

400
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:05,681
Canapes are prepared.
Small sandwiches, pies. -In the game.

401
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,320
Hello! -Chelsey, they live.

402
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,800
What did you mention games?
- Of course. We work in kindergarten.

403
00:43:16,121 --> 00:43:20,081
All the time, you invented
games for children. - Exactly.

404
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,641
Excuse me! All the time, I've been pissed off.
Chelsey, they live. What are you doing here?

405
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:32,081
I'm here because you're so busy.
- Yes, I'm sorry.

406
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,601
I brought you something.
-Very nice.

407
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,561
As soon as I saw him,
I remembered you.

408
00:43:46,721 --> 00:43:48,481
Johnny Appleseed.

409
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:53,440
Very cute. It's super.
Thank you, Chelsey.

410
00:43:55,721 --> 00:43:58,440
I would like to hang out,
but we have a meeting.

411
00:43:58,681 --> 00:44:01,240
We are planning a spring concert.
- Of course.

412
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,001
You should not get here.
-It's okay.

413
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,360
See yoga? - Sure.

414
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:12,240
Have fun. Bye.
-Hello, Chels.

415
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,960
Where are we staying?

416
00:44:27,561 --> 00:44:29,920
I will. -Thank you.

417
00:44:35,601 --> 00:44:38,721
I'm so relieved that
I could sleep here.

418
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:44,760
Or you can lie
in two, three hours.

419
00:44:45,041 --> 00:44:46,280
What? Why?

420
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:52,601
They're alive. What's happening?

421
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,840
Kolaèki. I know what that means.

422
00:45:02,641 --> 00:45:05,121
I can not believe you
were able to come.

423
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,440
They're all here!

424
00:45:16,201 --> 00:45:18,920
I know what it is.

425
00:45:19,601 --> 00:45:24,920
You knew I wanted it. Look!
She's prettier than my bags, I swear.

426
00:45:26,201 --> 00:45:27,760
I will. -Thank you.

427
00:45:29,201 --> 00:45:33,440
He has so many pockets. And that!
Thank you, Carly.

428
00:45:38,201 --> 00:45:45,440
Chelsey, they live. -I'm sorry I'm late.
- No, you're not invited.

429
00:45:45,641 --> 00:45:48,681
Chelsey, you came.
I was wondering where you are.

430
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:52,001
I'm sorry to be late.
I lost the invitation.

431
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,920
I forgot when it was.

432
00:45:55,121 --> 00:45:58,081
I did not ask you not
to spoil surprises.

433
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,121
You did not confirm.
We did not expect you.

434
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,760
It's enough food. Come in.
-Super.

435
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,960
That's fun. -Good.
It surprised me.

436
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:17,161
Chelsey has come.
- They're alive.

437
00:46:20,161 --> 00:46:22,601
You open the gifts.
I'm going after my own.

438
00:46:25,681 --> 00:46:28,081
Di, I'm very sorry.

439
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,521
I did not invite her because I was
afraid of something like that.

440
00:46:31,721 --> 00:46:33,360
I do not know how she found out.

441
00:46:34,641 --> 00:46:37,880
There it is! -Chelsey!

442
00:46:40,681 --> 00:46:45,440
I know you did not think you
would have it, but you should.

443
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,880
It's too much.
I can not accept it.

444
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,601
You can. It's a pleasure.
Friends serve this.

445
00:46:55,601 --> 00:46:57,121
Thank you. It's beautiful.

446
00:46:59,041 --> 00:47:00,360
You're welcome.

447
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,081
Chelsey, come up with something to eat.
I made small pies.

448
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,840
Right.

449
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:19,800
Will you say this is
not inappropriate?

450
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:13,800
What is? - I'm tired, it's
always uncomfortable for me.

451
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:19,840
I went out six times.
I used to sleep for three hours.

452
00:48:20,641 --> 00:48:24,041
Sleep on.
What do you have to do today?

453
00:48:25,721 --> 00:48:27,240
We have a prenatal course.

454
00:48:28,001 --> 00:48:34,400
Do we really have to go? -What do you mean?
- You will have a caesarean section.

455
00:48:35,001 --> 00:48:37,280
How likely is the usual birth?

456
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,041
I can get the cuts sooner.

457
00:48:41,481 --> 00:48:43,920
Then we will go to the
necessary caesarean section.

458
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:48,721
Dr. Harris said that a long birth
would be hard for a child.

459
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,121
Then we do not have to get
up and go to the course?

460
00:48:56,121 --> 00:48:57,800
I like this idea.

461
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,001
Morning. -Jutro.

462
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,721
Thanks for letting go with you.

463
00:49:27,081 --> 00:49:28,960
Watch your head.

464
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,760
Let's go.

465
00:49:43,201 --> 00:49:45,561
Take one for Diana.

466
00:49:49,641 --> 00:49:50,681
Thank you.

467
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:01,880
Do you remember when we were
here for the first time? -Yeah.

468
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:05,320
This time it will be better.
It's going to be wonderful.

469
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,960
Diane is gone.

470
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,481
Welcome to the first
prenatal course.

471
00:50:15,201 --> 00:50:18,280
I am your teacher and a
well-educated maternal "doula".

472
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,561
You can ask me everything.
Ready?

473
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,641
My friends are gone.

474
00:50:25,641 --> 00:50:29,201
We start at 10:00, that
everyone gets an hour they pay.

475
00:50:31,121 --> 00:50:35,960
The goal of the course is to
increase confidence in childbirth.

476
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,320
We'll start this today.

477
00:50:44,161 --> 00:50:46,400
You see? Their car is here.

478
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,920
Are you sure it's
okay if you show up?

479
00:50:54,561 --> 00:50:59,081
Jesse, what if something
happened to Diane?

480
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,240
Or a child?

481
00:51:03,081 --> 00:51:04,800
Stay here.

482
00:51:29,081 --> 00:51:31,840
Chelsey, they live. What is?

483
00:51:32,641 --> 00:51:37,240
What is? I was worried about you.
You did not go to the course.

484
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,721
I should contact you.
We decided not to go.

485
00:51:43,521 --> 00:51:47,601
What? How can she?

486
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:53,320
For personal reasons, Rob and I
decided to have a Caesarean section.

487
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:57,240
What? When?
-10. April.

488
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:06,201
You good? You want to talk about this?
- I do not have time.

489
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,960
I am preparing for
maternity leave.

490
00:52:09,121 --> 00:52:14,201
We are preparing for the baby with Rob.
I need time.

491
00:52:16,201 --> 00:52:18,481
I'm very sorry
that I scared you,

492
00:52:18,601 --> 00:52:21,360
I hope you like the course.
Talk to you.

493
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,201
Who was it? -Chelsey.

494
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,121
Do I just think it's
often unannounced?

495
00:53:00,641 --> 00:53:01,760
It does not seem to you.

496
00:53:03,081 --> 00:53:08,400
Is everything all right?
-No. I do not know.

497
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:15,440
Diane will go to the cesarean section.
She will not go to the course.

498
00:53:19,681 --> 00:53:25,360
Is that bad? - Of course. She did
not tell me why. I'm worried.

499
00:53:26,001 --> 00:53:30,400
I'm less accessible.
Maybe it's exaggerating.

500
00:53:30,561 --> 00:53:34,081
Do not waste energy to care
for Chelsea's feelings.

501
00:53:34,201 --> 00:53:38,920
I know that you are dumb
because it has no support.

502
00:53:39,121 --> 00:53:42,481
But there may be a reason.

503
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:48,440
You may be a little sad because your
friend does not go to the course.

504
00:53:57,121 --> 00:54:00,521
Only you, our child and
your health are important.

505
00:54:01,721 --> 00:54:03,920
Nothing else.

506
00:54:05,201 --> 00:54:06,920
Right? -Yeah.

507
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:23,320
You did not tell me about the pillar.
I'll fix it next week.

508
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:29,081
Jesse, maybe we do not have
to work around the house.

509
00:54:30,081 --> 00:54:31,121
What do you mean?

510
00:54:33,601 --> 00:54:37,360
What do you say to leave
bad memories behind you?

511
00:54:38,481 --> 00:54:42,481
and moved to Brewster?
Look how beautiful this house is.

512
00:54:43,681 --> 00:54:47,601
Brewster? Five hours away.
-In?

513
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,081
How will I go to work?
- You're going to work in Brewster.

514
00:54:52,721 --> 00:54:55,760
Chelsey, I have my
company in Pineville.

515
00:54:56,121 --> 00:54:58,800
Why would I leave him
for a nice house?

516
00:55:06,041 --> 00:55:09,320
Chelsey?

517
00:55:16,201 --> 00:55:19,081
Moving will not
reduce our problems.

518
00:55:19,681 --> 00:55:22,681
The problem was that we can not
have children. We'll have it now.

519
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,721
You do not think the child
will fix everything.

520
00:55:35,561 --> 00:55:39,880
What happened to Alexandra

521
00:55:42,601 --> 00:55:46,440
it was the worst that we experienced.
I did not want to.

522
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:52,601
But I'm not sure whether these are
the right conditions for a child.

523
00:55:53,840 --> 00:56:00,240
You do not even feel it's true.
It's coming.

524
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,641
Who is to blame for that?

525
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:06,320
You say you want me to be here, but
you shut me off all the time... He?

526
00:56:10,161 --> 00:56:14,041
Jesse, I'm tired.

527
00:56:15,001 --> 00:56:19,760
My back hurts. I have to restore.
- We gotta talk. -Later.

528
00:56:26,001 --> 00:56:27,081
Good.

529
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,481
I'll help you.
-Thank you. I'm really slow.

530
00:57:07,041 --> 00:57:08,360
He was powerful.

531
00:57:09,521 --> 00:57:13,081
I remember. You want to
to bring the child out of himself,

532
00:57:13,201 --> 00:57:15,481
He wants to jump
over the bladder.

533
00:57:15,721 --> 00:57:18,760
You're close. Five more days. -Yeah.

534
00:57:23,641 --> 00:57:27,601
You good? - Can you take it?
I'm going to the air.

535
00:57:28,001 --> 00:57:30,201
Come on, get ready.

536
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:33,521
There are two hours of poor
childish singing ahead of us.

537
00:57:33,601 --> 00:57:36,400
Not for those with bad nerves.
-Thank you. - Come on.

538
00:58:40,161 --> 00:58:41,201
Thank you.

539
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,440
Diane? -Chelsey.

540
00:59:03,561 --> 00:59:06,920
You are literally the only one in the
world that I want to talk to now.

541
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:12,201
You good? Did something happen?
- My law is officially closed. - What?

542
00:59:14,001 --> 00:59:16,800
Jesse sent me to divorce
papers in the morning.

543
00:59:17,521 --> 00:59:19,001
It's impossible.

544
00:59:20,161 --> 00:59:24,960
He thought about it. I do not give
it to him, that child will not.

545
00:59:26,721 --> 00:59:31,081
I want to start again with someone else.
-I am very sorry.

546
00:59:34,681 --> 00:59:40,201
Excuse me! Chamomile tea, please.
-Me too.

547
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,041
I'm sorry.

548
00:59:45,001 --> 00:59:47,001
Di, are you okay? You have not been long.

549
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,561
If only you would spend more
time with yourself and Rob.

550
01:00:01,641 --> 01:00:07,360
She could learn something.
They're a great couple. - You're in love.

551
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:12,360
I think your relationship can
be overwhelmed. -Thank you.

552
01:00:14,081 --> 01:00:16,201
I'm better now. Thank you.

553
01:00:17,081 --> 01:00:21,001
It's good to know that you
are not alone in the world.

554
01:00:21,681 --> 01:00:25,960
I'm very sorry that this is
happening to you. Especially now.

555
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:33,081
I would have spoken, but I have to go.
I'll miss the...

556
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:40,161
No talk. You took the time.
I pay.

557
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,001
Thank you.

558
01:00:42,561 --> 01:00:45,201
I'll call... - Are you okay?

559
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:51,001
Suddenly I was born.

560
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:58,521
It's hard to tolerate pregnancy, huh?
-Yeah. - Let me help you.

561
01:01:01,521 --> 01:01:03,201
It will go.

562
01:01:09,681 --> 01:01:11,400
Your stuff. -Thank you.

563
01:01:15,041 --> 01:01:16,800
Let's go. -Teamwork.

564
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,880
This is my car.
I'll take you.

565
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:32,121
It's not far. - Diane, please.
-Thank you.

566
01:01:34,041 --> 01:01:37,161
You installed a child seat.
-Right.

567
01:01:38,641 --> 01:01:44,280
I'm feeling weird.
- Close your eyes. It will help.

568
01:02:02,641 --> 01:02:06,920
Chelsey, where are you going? The nurse is in
that direction. You have to go to the left.

569
01:02:08,161 --> 01:02:11,161
Do not worry. I'll turn around.

570
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:26,840
What...

571
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:34,001
What's happening? Where are we?
- You can confess.

572
01:02:34,201 --> 01:02:39,360
I feel...
Stunned.

573
01:02:40,201 --> 01:02:43,561
You're smart. It just
made you calm down.

574
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,041
What?
- Even I deserve happiness, Diane.

575
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:56,800
I'm here. So.

576
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,041
There you are.
- I'm late? Diane said to come at 19.

577
01:03:03,121 --> 01:03:05,440
It's only 18.45.
- So it's not with you.

578
01:03:05,721 --> 01:03:09,121
Diane? No. I need to make
an appearance with you.

579
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:12,800
I know. She was there by the
service, but I can not find her.

580
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,280
I called her twice.
He does not answer.

581
01:03:18,201 --> 01:03:22,601
We checked all the classrooms and toilets.
The car is in the parking lot.

582
01:03:41,681 --> 01:03:45,041
Diane, it's me. Where are you?
You good? Call me.

583
01:04:19,561 --> 01:04:20,960
See who woke up.

584
01:04:22,601 --> 01:04:26,800
Diane, we have a lot of work.

585
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,320
You will give me a baby.

586
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:37,041
Chelsey, what is this?

587
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,800
Something that will cause birth.

588
01:04:42,481 --> 01:04:46,280
It will soon start working.
-Chelsey, please, no.

589
01:04:47,081 --> 01:04:49,521
You will harm a child.

590
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:51,960
He would never have.

591
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:58,360
I will help him to be born, bring
him home, and love him forever.

592
01:05:00,001 --> 01:05:01,760
This is my plan
from the beginning.

593
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:05,521
Chelsey, this is my child.
Your daddy's home.

594
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,280
You do not really understand.

595
01:05:08,081 --> 01:05:14,840
Look. Terrible, is not it? I had
to wear that for six months.

596
01:05:15,481 --> 01:05:18,481
It's crap, it's hot and heavy.

597
01:05:19,481 --> 01:05:21,320
It's tough.

598
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:31,041
I have a complete dress.

599
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:35,641
Oh, God. You are crazy.
-I did not.

600
01:05:37,201 --> 01:05:40,201
Try to carry your baby
eight months and a half,

601
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:44,521
then find out that
he died in you.

602
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:48,760
Chelsey... -Try to give birth to you,

603
01:05:49,161 --> 01:05:54,320
your husband will buy the smallest
coffin on the market the next day.

604
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:58,721
Chelsey...
- Try to survive three rafts after that.

605
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,081
I'm sorry, now four.

606
01:06:03,081 --> 01:06:07,320
It hurt, I spent months,
wasting my savings.

607
01:06:07,481 --> 01:06:10,440
I did everything to give
birth to this baby.

608
01:06:11,121 --> 01:06:15,880
But three specialists told me
that my womb, like my law,

609
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,721
irreparably damaged
this first, lost child.

610
01:06:20,201 --> 01:06:26,201
Chelsey, we'll give you everything
with Rob. Everything you want.

611
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:30,601
What? Money? Do you think
I want your money?

612
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:35,360
Money does not bring luck.
Family her.

613
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:43,641
Diane, I will not do anything to you.

614
01:06:44,561 --> 01:06:46,601
You were a good friend of mine.

615
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,960
That's why I know you're the
perfect replacement mother.

616
01:06:51,121 --> 01:06:55,840
What? John is my child!
- His name is Alexander.

617
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:00,721
Do not yell, that your pressure does not
increase, you will endanger the child.

618
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:06,840
They can have other kids with Rob.
This is my only chance.

619
01:07:07,521 --> 01:07:09,001
Chelsey, you do not understand.

620
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:15,800
He's sick. He must go to the hospital.
That's why we subscribed to Caesarean section!

621
01:07:16,121 --> 01:07:20,601
Good experiment. -No! I'm not lying to you.
He's very sick.

622
01:07:20,681 --> 01:07:23,920
You think I can not worry
about a sick child?

623
01:07:24,481 --> 01:07:30,121
That's what Mom starts. -You can not.
Please! I beg you.

624
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:34,161
Getting started!

625
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:38,840
Relax. I want Alexander to come
to a safe, peaceful environment.

626
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:44,001
Do not worry. I know what I'm doing.

627
01:07:44,121 --> 01:07:47,920
Listen to me and everything will be fine.

628
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:52,280
Only after 48 hours
is it missing.

629
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,521
Nine months is pregnant.

630
01:07:56,001 --> 01:07:59,561
Was she happy for pregnancy?
Have problems?

631
01:07:59,681 --> 01:08:03,081
We have no problems!
-Detective, Diane is not like that.

632
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:06,760
Thank you.

633
01:08:10,521 --> 01:08:15,240
Who is this? -Nick. This cell phone
remained in the Pierre coffee shop.

634
01:08:23,801 --> 01:08:28,560
Come on! I know it hurts, but you can do it.
These women have always begun.

635
01:08:28,801 --> 01:08:32,320
I want you to walk with me on the course,
but you learn while you're alive.

636
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,881
Come on! Take a deep breath.

637
01:08:35,761 --> 01:08:37,480
No. Slightly breathe.

638
01:08:43,201 --> 01:08:47,801
I saw her, she was with
another pregnant woman.

639
01:08:49,161 --> 01:08:53,280
She looked sick.
She was spinning when they were leaving.

640
01:08:55,801 --> 01:08:56,841
I'm going to report.

641
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:08,041
Push! I see the head.
Push!

642
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:13,081
It's as strong as it can!
Push! Push! So!

643
01:09:23,921 --> 01:09:25,360
Can I see him?

644
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,841
So.

645
01:09:30,881 --> 01:09:33,360
It's good? It's good?

646
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:42,280
Let me see him. Please!
Please, Chelsey.

647
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,961
He's the most beautiful boy in the world.

648
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:51,801
Give me my baby!

649
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:57,201
Alexander Jesse Miller, it's
nice to finally get to know you.

650
01:10:01,961 --> 01:10:03,081
The blue has become.

651
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:08,560
I told you he was sick!
The operation must. He can die!

652
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:13,600
Diane, I'm very sorry.
I did not want to hurt you.

653
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,841
I have to take Alexandra
to the hospital.

654
01:10:18,001 --> 01:10:21,360
I know, boy. I know.

655
01:10:24,961 --> 01:10:26,480
I know, I know.

656
01:10:30,801 --> 01:10:32,560
It's okay, it's okay.

657
01:10:43,841 --> 01:10:46,041
Come on. -No!

658
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,921
No!

659
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,921
It's mine!

660
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:59,961
Chelsey!
- It's okay, Alexander. Mom is here.

661
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:03,881
Everything will be fine.
- Help! Help me!

662
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:22,121
Mr. King, everybody is looking for your wife.

663
01:11:34,961 --> 01:11:37,041
Chelsey? -Jesse?
-What's happening?

664
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,680
I was born. - What?

665
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:44,320
Something is wrong.
I have to take him to the hospital.

666
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:49,720
I take him to the hospital
along the highway 16.

667
01:11:50,161 --> 01:11:53,121
What do you mean? Oh, God.

668
01:11:54,081 --> 01:11:55,121
I'll see you there.

669
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:08,520
My child!
- We need help.

670
01:12:08,801 --> 01:12:10,921
My child does not breathe. - Sister?

671
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:15,520
Help him.
-Right for review no. 3.

672
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:19,001
I'm good.
- Let's check it out. -I'm fine!

673
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:21,440
You gave birth to yourself.
- I want a child.

674
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,761
Bloody. We have to examine you.
- I want a child!

675
01:12:23,841 --> 01:12:25,360
To room no. 3, right away.

676
01:12:26,081 --> 01:12:28,600
I need data.

677
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:37,400
Help! Help!

678
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,041
Help!

679
01:12:46,961 --> 01:12:48,841
Help me, please!

680
01:12:51,081 --> 01:12:55,201
Help me! Help me!

681
01:13:00,201 --> 01:13:04,240
I did not like it. She was looking for
attention, she was a little weird.

682
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:08,201
But I do not know if she's capable...
-Excuse me.

683
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:11,280
Carson.

684
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,081
Great. Excuse me.

685
01:13:23,041 --> 01:13:27,041
A woman, about 30 years old, is bloody.
She was born, but she does not have a baby.

686
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:32,041
Excuse me, is there anything news about
my wife or child? -Just a moment.

687
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,841
This is Mrs. Miller's husband.
The panic is grabbing it.

688
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:40,881
It's also right. His wife brought a
baby, but she did not give birth.

689
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:45,001
What?
- Call the police and the psychiatrist.

690
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,240
The child has to undergo surgery.

691
01:14:01,001 --> 01:14:04,881
Mrs. Miller? - How's my kid?
It's good?

692
01:14:05,121 --> 01:14:08,560
I came to you.
I have some questions.

693
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:37,201
My wife just came in.
Diane King.

694
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:01,961
She got her powerful medicine.
She lost a lot of blood.

695
01:15:02,201 --> 01:15:05,520
Try to talk to her.
It should help.

696
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:18,761
Diane.

697
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,001
Diane.

698
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:43,400
Diane. What is?

699
01:15:44,921 --> 01:15:46,801
Chelsey. - What?

700
01:15:48,841 --> 01:15:50,841
Chelsey took our baby.

701
01:16:00,961 --> 01:16:04,801
Chelsey Miller took our baby.
Diane told me.

702
01:16:04,881 --> 01:16:09,280
We have to find him. The operation must.
- Your son is here. - On the operation.

703
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:16,161
Really? It's a miracle. That's
good news, is not it? - Of course.

704
01:16:17,041 --> 01:16:19,121
As soon as I find
something, I tell you.

705
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:27,680
Sir, you are a man
ge. Chelsey Miller?

706
01:16:35,961 --> 01:16:37,041
I did not know.

707
01:16:44,961 --> 01:16:48,201
Sir? -Yeah.

708
01:16:49,121 --> 01:16:50,600
I have some questions.

709
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:55,841
I want to see my baby! You can
not take it out! He needs me!

710
01:16:55,921 --> 01:17:01,161
It's my child! My!
I'm a good mom! You can not...

711
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:04,921
I'm a good mom!
Good... - Relax.

712
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:25,480
Where is? - Here. John is on the operation.
- I have to see him.

713
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,761
You can not. -No! -You can not.

714
01:17:28,841 --> 01:17:31,280
I want to see my baby.
- I know.

715
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,761
I want to see him. - I know.

716
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:37,841
I want to keep it in order.
- I know, darling.

717
01:17:42,161 --> 01:17:46,801
Mr. Miller, was your wife ever
hospitalized, going to a psychiatrist?

718
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,520
No.

719
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:52,841
Did you go with her to
gynecological examinations?

720
01:17:52,921 --> 01:17:55,720
Have you ever been
involved in pregnancy?

721
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:02,480
We were not together.
She did not want me to be involved.

722
01:18:04,081 --> 01:18:08,360
They did not make a plan
how to get a family?

723
01:18:10,001 --> 01:18:11,480
What are you talking about?

724
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:18,280
Did not you know that your wife is not
worried she did not give birth today?

725
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:20,761
It's impossible!

726
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:26,001
Chelsey told the psychiatrist that she had
paid $ 5,000 to her replacement mother.

727
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:43,841
Excuse me.

728
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,121
I'm guilty of everything. - You do not.

729
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:52,881
I dropped her into our lives.
Invited her to our home.

730
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:56,921
You could not know.
Who would think of such a thing?

731
01:18:57,081 --> 01:18:59,240
My job is to protect him, Rob.

732
01:19:00,161 --> 01:19:01,961
Sir and Madam King?

733
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:05,480
How is our child?
It's good? - It's fine.

734
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:10,001
The operation was heavy,
and we operated a hernia.

735
01:19:11,001 --> 01:19:15,720
In the morning, they will go to the county hospital.
They are bigger babies specialists.

736
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:22,161
By that time, we will take good care of him.
-Thank you. -You're welcome.

737
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:27,400
Can I see him?
- Just when you're ready. - I'll do it.

738
01:19:41,801 --> 01:19:46,041
You'll have to let him down.
-Just a little bit.

739
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,360
"Little light-blue boy,

740
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:05,801
blow into the trumpet,

741
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:09,841
sheep are in the meadow,

742
01:20:11,841 --> 01:20:14,680
cows in corn.

743
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:19,921
Where is this boy,

744
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,520
who keeps the sheep?

745
01:20:32,041 --> 01:20:34,320
Where is this boy,

746
01:20:36,921 --> 01:20:39,640
who keeps the sheep?

747
01:20:42,801 --> 01:20:45,801
It's in the shade,

748
01:20:48,001 --> 01:20:50,480
sleeping firmly?

749
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,640
Will you wake him up?

750
01:20:59,041 --> 01:21:01,240
I do not.

751
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:06,201
If I wake him up,

752
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:12,001
he will cry. "
