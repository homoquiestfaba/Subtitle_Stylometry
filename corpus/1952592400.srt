1
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,000
A lot of things happened

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,590
in the past

3
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,960
and then I was born

4
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,590
Then I went to Texas, to do a show

5
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,090
Now I'd like to tell you a little bit about me

6
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,320
I grew up in central New Jersey

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,560
I had a childhood too

8
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,950
I liked skateboarding

9
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,320
I found it relaxing, fun

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,630
Then I did some jobs for money

11
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,900
They were not as fun as the skateboarding

12
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,710
Now I do live comedy shows

13
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,250
Can you handle that?

14
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,400
Sometimes on TV
Like right now

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,570
Get ready to have your asses blown off
by me

16
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,870
With subtle

17
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,600
With subtle
Low energy
Comedy

18
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,480
Thank you

19
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,480
Thank you audience.
That's nice

20
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:32,080
Thanks guys.
Appreciate it.

21
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,690
Thank for being here, for my special.

22
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,160
Those are the best claps I'm going to get,
so I think I'm going to end on that.

23
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,360
Oh, ok. They're saying I should do more. Alright.

24
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,830
I saw a friend of mine I hadn't seen
in a while and I went to shake his hand,

25
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,460
I went in for the handshake.

26
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,000
When I went to shake his hand, he squeezes the fingers part, he cut me off.

27
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,640
Making me give him a wussy handshake.

28
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,700
But I though, like quickly, and I just went with it. I just went,

29
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,420
'Charmed'

30
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,510
Punk!

31
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,290
You cut me off, I curtsey on your ass.

32
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,910
I hate when I'm going in for a handshake
and I'm coming in traditional,
I'm showing you my hand

33
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,650
and then the person come back
to me with, like, the fist thing.

34
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,620
But that I got to scramble, like upgrade,
oh we're doing the fist, ok.

35
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,810
Because yours is newer,
I got to do your thing.

36
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,860
So I don't do it. I just go like,

37
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,310
Paper covers rock, bitch.

38
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,360
<?>

39
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:50,080
What I thought about,
I like rock paper scissors two-thirds.

40
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,030
Rock breaks scissors.

41
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,820
These scissors are bent, they're destroyed,
I can't cut stuff. I loose.

42
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,010
Scissors cuts paper.

43
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:03,630
These are strips. This is not even paper, it could take me forever to put this back together. You got me.

44
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,730
Paper covers rock.

45
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,480
Rock is fine.

46
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,820
No structural damage to rock.

47
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,760
Rock can break through paper at any point.

48
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,410
Just say the word.

49
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,120
Paper sucks.

50
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,120
It should be; rock,

51
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,890
dynamite with a cuttable wick,

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,820
scissors.

53
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,700
I like to stand near to ATM machines and when somebody types in their pin number I go,

54
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,170
'Got it!' and then I run away.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,810
I like staying in hotels, because you can leave a message for somebody and you don't even need to know their name.

56
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,940
Just like a room number, you know.

57
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,200
'Hey, can I get a pen? I just want to leave a messa- yeah, my friend's in 710. Thanks'

58
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,800
Leprechaun is gonna fuck you up at midnight.

59
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,170
'Honey, what the hell is this? Did you anger a small Irishman?'

60
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,250
When I'm drinking I like to have a straw.

61
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,900
The straw enables you to drink without using your wrist.

62
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,060
Straw is your friend.

63
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,430
Until you lose eye contact with the straw.

64
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,430
Then he'll betray you and make you look like an idiot.

65
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,230
I just act like I'm surprised or something, so I cover it up.

66
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,870
My god!

67
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,140
That's what you had for breakfast?!

68
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,310
Then I got to pull the straw aside.

69
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,730
What the hell do you think you're doing?!

70
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,870
The last time I checked you were right by my mouth.

71
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,890
What the hell are you doing
on the other side of the glass?

72
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,050
I don't need you, you're a luxury!

73
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,990
The ice is even worse.

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,150
I get to the bottom of the glass, it's just me and the ice.

75
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,960
Just one of you, I want something to chew on. Come on.

76
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,640
And the ice is like, 'Hold...'

77
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,310
'Brothers, hold...'

78
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,760
'Everybody strike! Now!'

79
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,910
I wonder how good the spotlight guy is.

80
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,420
Pretty good.

81
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,290
The easiest time to add insult to injury

82
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,140
is when you're signing somebody's cast.

83
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,890
'You're a dick!'

84
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,110
'You deserve this!'

85
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,900
'Also, I'm sorry I broke your leg.'

86
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,720
'Jerk.'

87
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,490
I wonder what's the smallest garbage can I can put on the curb outside my house.

88
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,810
And have them empty it and put it back.

89
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,840
'I hate this guy, I hate this guy.'

90
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,640
'These freakin' tiny- Four?! Really, four tiny garbage cans, are you kidding me?!'

91
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,860
'He chained them up man, come on!'

92
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,930
Then one time I would leave
a tiny sweater next to the cans.

93
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,280
So when the garbage man comes he's like,

94
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,230
'Wait a minute. This guy's not a jerk.
We have a tiny resident living here.'

95
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,030
'These are appropriately sized.
Never mind.'

96
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,040
'Regular sized house though.
He's doing very well for himself.'

97
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,610
I was sitting on a bench in New York
and I was trying to work.

98
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,790
I was sitting there and I was writing
in my notebook and I suddenly heard;

99
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,340
So looked up, 'Uh?'

100
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,060
And there was a guy standing
four feet from me just going;

101
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,180
To a squirrel that was three feet from me.

102
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,170
So I looked at the squirrel,
and he wasn't looking up.

103
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,260
And I realized; ah man, are you kidding me?!

104
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,510
I'm less focused than squirrels?

105
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,790
I'm working, I hear,

106
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,030
'Uh, what's that?'

107
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,420
Aimed at the squirrel,
he's like, 'Come man, really?'

108
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,920
'Nice try, stupid.'

109
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,230
'I got a acorn.'

110
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,300
I saw a sign on this door,
it said "Exit only".

111
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,110
So entered it and went up
to the guy working there,

112
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,770
'I have some good news.'

113
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,680
'You have severely underestimated
this door over here.'

114
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,890
'By like a hundred percent man.'

115
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,190
I hate heavy doors.

116
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,100
I hate when there's a heavy door,
because there should be a sign on it.

117
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,840
That says, 'Warning!'

118
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,700
'You're gonna look weak right now.'

119
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,500
Damn it!

120
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,290
Why didn't you tell me man?

121
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:03,890
I'm walking with a girl here. I don't
want to struggle to get into the bar.

122
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:08,250
So now I treat every door like it's heavy,
because I don't want to get burned again.

123
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,380
The problem is, every door isn't heavy.

124
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,040
So I'm like slamming doors.

125
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:20,000
I want to slam a door and have an emotion
to go with the activity that looks crazy.

126
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,380
So when I'm in a situation like when
I go to a convenient store, I'm just like;

127
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,390
I need some gum, now!

128
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,500
I don't have time to mess around man,
I got some bad breath!

129
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,330
Why is your door so light?

130
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,850
That looks delicious.

131
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,520
A want to make a revolving door
that says "pull" on it.

132
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,590
To see how obedient people are, you know.

133
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,350
'Ow, it's one of these. I'm sorry. Excuse me'

134
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,140
'Sorry, just coming through here.'

135
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,310
'It's the door, it's not me.'

136
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,430
Some of my research.

137
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,940
So this is a large pad.

138
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:15,670
On this pad I have data from the last year.
These are findings.

139
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,460
So I'd like to go into that.

140
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,090
Let's start with a simple chart.

141
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,380
Ok, this is pretty simple.

142
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,620
This is; how short the person is
vs. how drunk the person is.

143
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,900
And this line is how funny it is.

144
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,820
You see the shorter and more drunk
the person is, the funnier it is.

145
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,020
This up here would be like a midget
or a small child who's very drunk.

146
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,490
Here is a guy who's 6 foot and he's just buzzing.
It's like, nah, not so much.

147
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,900
But here we have a dwarf who's about to take a dive off a chair.

148
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,550
Can I get this man another shot, maybe some whisky in a thimble?

149
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,810
Breakdown of hummer owners.

150
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,150
Though guys come in at 43% of the owners.

151
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,960
Prick are 27%

152
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,890
Douche bags are 15%

153
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,190
Now dildoes are almost 15%

154
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,020
And this is interesting, because I never had to pluralize dildo before

155
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,120
I don't know if that's right. It looks like dil-does.

156
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,190
And I hope I never have to again.

157
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,990
Like in a deposition or something.

158
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,490
How many dildoes were there?

159
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,260
I don't know, but I'm sore and I want to go home.

160
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:50,130
How funny I find farts by location.

161
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,600
School is pretty funny, church is funnier.

162
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,180
My face isn't funny at all, that negative.

163
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,360
My brother's face is off the charts though.

164
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,570
Scuba, I'm not sure.

165
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,140
It depends. If you can see the bubbles come out of the wetsuit,

166
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:16,470
that's pretty funny. 'Haha! We have a man punishing fishermen at a distance. Very nice.'

167
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,500
Actually, it's probably funnier if you can't see the bubbles come out.

168
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,920
Because then you see a guy swimming and all of a sudden he just starts to

169
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,120
struggle in his own air supply.

170
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,860
'Most stop farting into own nostrils.'

171
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,850
'Never taco's before scuba.'

172
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,930
Flowchart of clowns.

173
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,000
Circus, annoying.

174
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,170
Birthday clown, sad.

175
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,530
One that's just around is creepy.

176
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,180
If any of them get hurt it's funny.

177
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,710
There's a saying that goes, 'people living in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.'

178
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,930
Ok. How about;

179
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,710
Nobody should throw stones.

180
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,880
That's crappy behaviour!

181
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,360
My policy is;

182
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,090
Don't do it.

183
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:17,920
There is one exception though.

184
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,320
If you're trapped in a glass house,

185
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,050
and you have a stone, throw it!

186
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,780
What are you, an idiot?!

187
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,530
So really it's; only people in glass houses should throw stones.

188
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,750
Provided they are trapped in a house with the stone.

189
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,750
It's a little longer, but, you know.

190
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,610
Pony tail locations.

191
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,230
Pony's ass, ok.

192
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,880
Back of my dad's friend's head, not ok.

193
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,850
Mostly because of this area right here.

194
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,740
This isn't helping this, that's not good.

195
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,960
This is a pie chart about procrastination.

196
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,900
Ok, this is very auto biographical.

197
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,650
This is the cuteness of a girl

198
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:14,470
vs. how interested I am in hearing about how intuitive her cat is.

199
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,110
You see; the cuter the girl is, the more I'm willing to hear about the cat.

200
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,800
'Oh really?'
'Yeah, he's very intuitive.'

201
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,740
But you notice, at a certain point I don’t care how cute you are.

202
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,260
I don't want to hear about your fucking cat anymore.

203
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,540
I hate your cat.

204
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,160
When you leave the room I try to get it.

205
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,320
This is my ability to draw mountains over time.

206
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,240
I learned something on the road, travelling around.

207
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,160
State shapes:

208
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,610
The easier it is to draw the shape of the state,

209
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,060
The harder it is to live in that state.

210
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,690
So if you live in a regular polygon get the hell out of there.

211
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,500
You got to move to a squiggly area.

212
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,610
Culture is attracted to squiggles.

213
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,570
Those who see the glass half full are considered optimists.

214
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,500
But shouldn't we be more specific about the contents of the glass?

215
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,770
If it is a glass of shit then I'm going half empty.

216
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:33,520
I don't like shit. An optimist, 'A half empty shit glass right here, so don't worry about it.'

217
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,620
Baby blood, that's even more complicated.

218
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,820
Is this blood going to a baby or coming from a baby?

219
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:52,000
To a baby; we got half full glass of baby blood here, he's going to be fine. Don't worry about it.

220
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,280
From a baby; ok, hold on, it's a half empty baby blood glass.

221
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,900
Don't ask me why I collected the blood in a glass, just listen to what I'm saying.

222
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,720
Finally pillow fights:

223
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,350
Man vs. woman, fun.

224
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,000
Man vs. man, gay.

225
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,400
Woman vs. woman, awesome.

226
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,490
Man vs. pillow, crazy.

227
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,640
Pillow vs. pillow, crazy awesome.

228
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,840
That's a real pillow fight right there.

229
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,590
If you see two pillows fighting you know something's going down.

230
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,680
They're designed for relaxation.

231
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,560
If they're fighting what hope do we have?

232
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,600
One time I saw two geese fighting, I was like

233
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,850
This is a pillow fight ahead of time.

234
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,000
Hey porcupines

235
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,940
Whenever people talk about porcupines it's always about the needles.

236
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,110
Oh, he's got needles watch out.

237
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,660
Well I want to know other stuff

238
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,860
like; are they good swimmers?

239
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,590
How does a porcupine handle himself in the water?

240
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,190
Are they social?

241
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,010
What kind of habits do porcupines have?

242
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:28,330
And what would happen if I threw marshmallows at one?

243
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,280
And then roasted him over a fire?

244
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,280
Could be good.

245
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,810
So with porcupines it's not just needles.

246
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,990
They're also, like

247
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,470
Skewers.

248
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,620
A power nap

249
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,830
is when you sleep on someone

250
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,950
who's weaker than you.

251
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,800
I went whale watching once

252
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,650
it was very similar

253
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,960
to watching people on a boat become disappointed

254
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,680
we did a lot of whale-thinking-about that day

255
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,110
A mobile home with a flat tire is a home

256
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,990
If you can't tell the difference between a spoon and a ladle

257
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,270
then you're fat.

258
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,150
I want to put stickers on turtles

259
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,870
I don't know why

260
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,170
I just know I want to put them on them

261
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:53,110
That's the best kind of animal for
advertising your band in mother nature.

262
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,290
I got a time machine at home.

263
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,250
It only goes forward at regular speed.

264
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:10,060
It is essentially a cardboard box and on the outside I wrote "time machine" ...<?>

265
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,300
I love unnecessary bells.

266
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,390
How fast does a zebra have to run before he looks gray?

267
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,510
Now, I've met many chocoholics

268
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:30,560
but I've never seen no chocohol.

269
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,570
We got an epidemic people

270
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,980
People who love chocolate

271
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,210
and don't understand the rules of word endings.

272
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:43,000
They're probably overworkaholled

273
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,110
They call it fishing, but they should call it what it really is;

274
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,550
tricking and killing

275
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,590
-fishing.

276
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,020
Hiking is just walking were it is ok to pee.

277
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,860
Sometimes old people hike by mistake.

278
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,480
Now, if you're a chick magnet,

279
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,320
be very careful about which direction you face.

280
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,350
Because you could become a chick repellent.

281
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,950
I want to commit a crime during a re-enactment.

282
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,220
Turn it into an enactment.

283
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,600
Hot potato

284
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,400
is a very different game when the people playing are starving.

285
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,930
Then it's more like "my potato"

286
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:55,350
Burned fingertips and I don't give a damn. Free potato!

287
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,890
It's very easy to turn a toy into an adult toy.

288
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:03,310
Location!
Location!
Location!

289
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,710
If I ever saw an amputee being hanged

290
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:16,450
I would just yell out letters.

291
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,980
I used to get bummed out when it rained.

292
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,520
But then I realized

293
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,300
that's god's way of washing off hippies.

294
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,310
Rain is short for

295
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,480
<?> neutralizer.

296
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,510
Sometime when you learn the meaning of a term

297
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,910
it can be very disappointing.

298
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:03,590
When I was a kid, we were going to meet one of my mom's friends once.

299
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,870
And on the way

300
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,170
she described her to me as a cat person.

301
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,560
I got there, I was like
'Wait a minute

302
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,630
You just like cats?

303
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,280
That's a cat liker, man.

304
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,840
Cat person is a different story.

305
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,080
'Why does Steven never go into the pool?'

306
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,880
'Oh, he's a cat person. Alright.'

307
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,800
I think they should put pies on the front of trains.

308
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,700
So when they hit something

309
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,490
it's at least a little bit funny.

310
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,240
He's dead, but

311
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,480
There's a cream pie right in his face.

312
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:53,140
This is a little bit funny <?>, I have to admit.

313
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,760
I saw a transvestite wearing a shirt that said "Guess".

314
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,710
I was walking down the street and this guy waved to me.

315
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,030
Then he came up to me and said, 'I'm sorry I thought you were someone else.'

316
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,660
I said, 'I am.'

317
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,430
I love birthdays.

318
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,930
You get a cake for every day that you're alive.

319
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,900
When I see a new baby, I'm like 'Yes!'

320
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,980
'Please survive.'

321
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,140
'And I like chocolate.'

322
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:37,360
Cakes are the only food we write on.

323
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,420
It's always so encouraging, like

324
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,340
Happy birthday Leo

325
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,760
Congratulation Eric

326
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,370
I feel like we're missing an opportunity.

327
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,060
I'm talking about negative cakes.

328
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,910
Surprise!

329
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,290
You're adopted.

330
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,740
Because that's when you want cake.

331
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,510
I love women, but you can't always trust them.

332
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,290
Some of them are liars.

333
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,890
Like this girl I met in the park.

334
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,390
She was walking her dog. And she was cute, so I started to talk to her.

335
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,710
She told me her dog's name. I said, 'does he bite?'

336
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,330
She said, 'no.'

337
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:24,470
I said, 'Oh yeah?'

338
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,270
'Then how does he eat?'

339
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,970
'Liar!'

340
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,100
I'm in a weird situation, because I like rainbows,

341
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,180
but I'm not gay.

342
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,820
So I wear a rainbow on my shirt, but then under it I got to put 'not gay'.

343
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,310
But I'm not against gay people,

344
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:55,320
so under that I got to put 'but supportive.'

345
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,760
I just think it's weird that one group took refracted light.

346
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,030
That's pretty greedy, gays!

347
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,670
Hello

348
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:42,530
My name is professor Erwin Glands.

349
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:46,520
I'm a doctor of mytho-zoology.

350
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:51,700
And today I'd like to talk to you about some less common mythical creatures.

351
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,070
Little bit about myself;

352
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:59,320
I have several advanced degrees and written a number of books

353
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,900
on the topic of legend, folklore, mythology.

354
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:08,540
Specifically with respect to animals.

355
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:12,000
Most of you have probably heard of certain imaginary creatures,

356
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,390
like the dragon

357
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:16,470
or the unicorn.

358
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:20,040
I want to talk about some that you may not be so familiar with.

359
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,100
I'd like to start with a creature from the sea.

360
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,540
The Vertimaid.

361
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:28,600
Much like a mermaid, it's half woman, half fish.

362
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,350
But unlike the mermaid the vertimaid is split down the middle.

363
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:36,270
Which makes it a little less attractive than the typical mermaid,

364
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:39,270
and also creates certain physical problems.

365
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,890
Next up is the Amoebicorn.

366
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:50,800
This is like an amoeba, but his a very small horn attached to it.

367
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,920
This animal is very imaginary

368
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:58,780
because it's very small, to imagine a horn that small is very difficult.

369
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,240
And it's very magical.

370
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,710
A very beautiful mythical creature is called a zebratard.

371
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:14,380
And this animal is one half pig, one half eagle, one half zebra

372
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:17,510
making it an improper fraction,

373
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:23,230
so that's three halves of a creature that's one and a half mythical creatures.

374
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:27,110
And it's surprisingly graceful, and very rare.

375
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:34,100
An imaginary creature that has confused experts for centuries is the paradoxotaur.

376
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:40,560
This creature only exists if you don't believe it exists.

377
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,720
But if you do believe it exists, then it does not exist.

378
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:53,210
Experts have made guesses as to the appearance of the paradoxotaur, what form it might take.

379
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:55,840
But really it's anybody's guess.

380
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:03,240
Finally I'd like to talk about the most controversial mythical creature of all

381
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,410
and that is the RexFidoBuster.

382
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:09,300
Which is a three headed dog

383
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,570
that also has three dog bodies.

384
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:17,590
This has stirred up a bit of contention in the mytho-zoological field

385
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:23,130
because some experts content that this is simply three dogs standing near each other.

386
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:32,510
Well I've got to go back to work, but I hope this was informative and helpful.

387
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,580
Take care.

388
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,710
Let's play the guitar for you a little bit.

389
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,260
Forgot my harmonica. Damn.

390
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:50,920
I'll get it.

391
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,280
In a cool way.

392
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:36,610
There's a store in my neighbourhood called futon world.

393
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:39,210
I love that name, futon world.

394
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,610
It makes me think of a magical place

395
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,850
That becomes less comfortable over time.

396
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,380
Whenever I use my computer I don't type LOL

397
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,900
I type LQTM

398
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:59,530
Laugh Quietly To Myself

399
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,200
It's more honest.

400
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:06,180
By the way, if you want to sound like a creep

401
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:09,110
just add the word ladies to the end of things that you say.

402
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:13,510
And you sound like a creep. Can be harmless too.

403
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:14,960
Like

404
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,010
Thanks for coming to my show

405
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,400
Thanks for coming to my show,
ladies.

406
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,290
Help! I've fallen into a well and I'm trapped.

407
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,370
Ladies.

408
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,670
It's like a jaccuzi with really high walls. You know you want it.

409
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,760
I went to this clothing store,

410
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,090
the lady working there she got mad at me.

411
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,790
She said, 'What size are you?'

412
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,570
I said, 'Actual!'

413
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,730
This ain't a trick, baby.

414
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:51,330
She was amazing. I'd never met a woman like her before.

415
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,120
She showed me to the dressing room.

416
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,270
She said, 'If you need anything, I'm Jill.'

417
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,430
I said, 'Oh my god.'

418
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:03,380
'I've never met a woman before with a conditional identity.'

419
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,710
'What if I don't need anything? Who are you?'

420
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,640
'If you don't need anything I'm Mike.'

421
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,210
A quick way to start a conversation is to say something like

422
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,130
'What's your favourite colour?'

423
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,520
Quick way to end a conversation is to say something like,

424
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,260
What's your favourite colour

425
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,220
-person?

426
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,980
I like video games, but they're very violent.

427
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,000
I want to design a video game

428
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,920
where you'd have to take care of all the people who had been shot in the other games.

429
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,120
'Hey man, what are you playing?'

430
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,380
'Super busy hospital.'

431
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,410
'Please leave me alone. I'm performing surgery on a man who's been shot in the 57 times.'

432
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,600
If somebody asks you the question 'Are you ticklish?'

433
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,500
it doesn't matter whether you say yes or no.

434
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,220
They're going to touch you.

435
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:31,150
If they say 'are you ticklish,' and you don't want to be touched,

436
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,760
you have to say something like,

437
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,470
'I have diarrhea.'

438
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,560
'And yes,'

439
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,110
'I'm very ticklish.'

440
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,070
Thanks guys.

441
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,530
I spent a lot of time with my jokes.

442
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,230
Right up until I tell them.

443
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,520
But then I never think about them again.

444
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,420
I wonder where my jokes go after that.

445
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,100
Well, I know they start in my head.

446
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,250
And the joke flies through the air.

447
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,350
They hit people's ears.

448
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:32,020
Then it keeps flying.

449
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,070
They go into the ears of animals too.

450
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,860
But they're too stupid to get the joke.

451
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,990
And the joke just keeps flying from there.

452
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,590
Off into the sky forever.
There's where my jokes go.

453
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:55,350
There's where my jokes go,
after I tell them.

454
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:04,350
I think they named oranges
before they named carrots.

455
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,290
What are these?

456
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,460
Those are orange.

457
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,870
Oranges.

458
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,590
How about these?

459
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,490
Oh, shit.

460
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,880
Long pointies?

461
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,600
Go by shape now?

462
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:27,670
I think it would be cool if you're
writing a ransom note on your computer

463
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,240
if the paperclip popped up
and said

464
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,390
Looks like you're writing
a ransom note.

465
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:38,230
Need some help?

466
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,730
You should use more
forceful language

467
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,410
You can get way more money.

468
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:58,040
I think graffiti is the most
passionate literature there is.

469
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,060
It's always like;
Bush sucks!

470
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,920
U2 rules!

471
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,460
I want to make indifferent graffiti.

472
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,060
Toy Story 2 was ok!

473
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:13,160
I like Gina as a friend, but I'm
not sure about taking things further.

474
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,160
This is a bridge!

475
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:25,400
I wonder if my jokes go anywhere after that.

476
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,090
They must keep flying.

477
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,950
Up into the sky.

478
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,300
Above treetops.

479
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:42,030
Where they encounter mythical beasts,

480
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:45,830
who are imaginary
and even more imaginary.

481
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:00,860
I like to do crafts.

482
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,830
I work with glitter quite a bit.

483
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:06,660
Don't worry, I make tough stuff
like daggers and skulls.

484
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:11,590
The thing about glitter is,
if you get it on you

485
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:14,950
be prepared to have it
on you forever.

486
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:19,160
Because glitter is the herpes
of craft supplies.

487
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,720
My jokes must keep flying
from there.

488
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:38,600
Up, above the sky,
into space.

489
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:42,860
Where they go on, and on.

490
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,380
Past astronauts.

491
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,870
Who respond appropriately
at the edge of the solar system.

492
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,350
Till the astronauts <?> off into deep space.

493
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,630
There are comets

494
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,710
that soar,

495
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:15,220
and a star, a bright star

496
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,420
watch the jokes fly by.

497
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:23,280
He's not famous,
but that's ok.

498
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:25,930
And they go through another dimension
where the joke

499
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,830
lands on a sister planet.

500
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:30,150
A little sister planet,
where my little sister

501
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:32,420
is a creature,
walks around wondering

502
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:35,260
What the hell is my brother
doing with his life?

503
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:43,300
There are rockets that watch the jokes shoot by.

504
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,580
Just in the deepest corner of space
I see a robot

505
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,830
A robot that looks like
my uncle Johnny.

506
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,710
He made me work at a diner.

507
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:06,250
But now he is just in space
with some jokes and my special.

508
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,930
Looks like

509
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,300
I got the last laugh.

510
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:17,150
It's weird the way finger puppets
sounds ok as a noun.

511
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,440
Ladies.

512
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,910
That's where my jokes go.

513
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:36,100
After I tell them.

514
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:39,470
They go into space.

515
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:43,510
That's where they go.

516
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,070
Thanks everybody.

517
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,580
Thanks for being at my special.

518
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,330
Had a great night.

P.S.
Sorry for any mistakes
and the few missing pieces.
