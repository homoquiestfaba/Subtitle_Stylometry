1
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:14,336
Are black people black

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136

00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936

4
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,456
The show

5
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,040
Submissions for next week show

6
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,600

00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,416
Pomelo

00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,208
Angry

10
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:09,632
Well there's always that stuff that crazy

11
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,568
After what happened last time

12
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,784
It's got to be better than

13
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,808
Bigfoot

14
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:18,240
No

15
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,776

Dib

20
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,656
We have a new piece in the puzzle that is

21
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,448
The search for alien life

22
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,472
I said out

23
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,496
Investigate

24
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,312
Kids

25
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,592
Play without fear

26
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,128
In the streets of this humble

27
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,712
In fact it's the kind of place where you don't even have

28
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,616
Enter this classroom he says he was prepared

29
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,384

Green

31
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:32,992
Happened that night

32
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,624
I was wondering some of the higher frequency

33
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,816
I feel it in my bones

34
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,960
What is

35
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:41,343
Alien

36
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
That's quite

37
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,183
Are you prepared

38
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487

39
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255

40
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,791

Well zip

45
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,663
I guess my first question is

46
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:12,063
Are you an alien

47
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,111

48
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159

50
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:25,375
I was at playing like any normal when she came looking for trouble

51
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:38,175
I just want to play

52
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,943

53
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,927

57
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,359

64
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:26,975

After what you saw it

68
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:36,703
You you believe that your brother got proof of intelligent extraterrestrial life

69
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,495
Intelligent no

70
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,055
My stupid brother did drag me out

71
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,591

00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:24,639
The only conclusion I can come

84
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,943
Definitely

85
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:31,551
I feel bad for the ugly green kid but there's a decent chance it's crazy too

86
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,111
But not an alien

87
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,415
Just crazy

88
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:48,191
Nothing matters anymore
