00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:18,817
We're closed.

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,320
Closed!

4
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:03,170
"Saul Goodman and Associates".

5
00:01:03,874 --> 00:01:06,697
I'll see if he's in.
Please, hold.

6
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:11,096
Skyler White, calling.

7
00:01:31,188 --> 00:01:32,550
Skyler White on the line.

8
00:01:34,907 --> 00:01:35,603
Hey.

9
00:01:38,986 --> 00:01:40,374
What the hell does she want?

10
00:01:47,923 --> 00:01:49,488
He's nowhere to be found?

11
00:01:49,571 --> 00:01:52,093
I called his condo. I called every
number I have for him.

12
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,115
I'm sure he's fine.

13
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,284
You're sure?
As in... you know where he is.

14
00:01:58,476 --> 00:02:00,915
I'm not the man's keeper,

15
00:02:00,998 --> 00:02:03,037
but Walt's a big boy.
He'll turn up.

16
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,424
Mr.Goodman, clearly something
is going on here.

17
00:02:05,507 --> 00:02:07,475
I mean, why would he leave
his car in my driveway?

18
00:02:07,558 --> 00:02:11,558
People carpool to work, right.
It's good for the environment.

19
00:02:11,806 --> 00:02:12,806
He carpools?

20
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:15,423
He carpools to his job
at a meth lab.

21
00:02:15,506 --> 00:02:20,849
Your breaking up, there.
I didn't quite catch that last...

22
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:23,118
You're a chatty cathy, today.

23
00:02:23,201 --> 00:02:25,918
Do you know anything? 
Anything, at all. 

24
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:27,981
Please, I am looking for some help, here. 

25
00:02:28,373 --> 00:02:33,528
Look, Walter is fine.
I guarantee that a hundred percent.

26
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,109
<i>100%...</i>

27
00:02:41,848 --> 00:02:43,518
You gotta passport, right?
