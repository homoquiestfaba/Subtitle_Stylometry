00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:28,859
And the weather, I mean,

3
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:30,060
I think it's gonna hold off,
but...

4
00:00:30,062 --> 00:00:32,130
Wanna get started?
People are gonna be coming in.

5
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:33,634
Okay, cool.

6
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,407
<i>For a long time,
I didn't want to get married.</i>

7
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,076
- Whoo!
- Yay!

8
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,448
<i>I felt like
I couldn't create a new family</i>

9
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,419
<i>until I came to terms
with what happened to my own.</i>

10
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:19,279
<i>I come from a long line
of New York Jews.</i>

11
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:28,452
<i>I'm the great granddaughter
of Eastern European immigrants</i>

12
00:01:28,454 --> 00:01:31,291
<i>who brought their culture
and traditions to Brooklyn.</i>

13
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,164
<i>The daughter
of a nice Jewish girl</i>

14
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,032
<i>and a nice Jewish boy.</i>

15
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,639
<i>I grew up
in a world of synagogue,</i>

16
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:52,110
<i>Hebrew school, bar mitzvahs.</i>

17
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,016
<i>My family knew who they were.</i>

18
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:59,419
<i>And they defined who I was.</i>

19
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:05,992
<i>So it never occurred to me
that I was passing.</i>

20
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:15,536
<i>I wasn't pretending
to be something I wasn't.</i>

21
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:22,442
<i>I actually grew up believing
I was white.</i>

22
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,665
See, we're real Jews.

23
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,769
Ha, ha. This proves it.

24
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,774
I'll show you.
These are my grandparents.

25
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,274
This is Uncle Lou.

26
00:02:57,276 --> 00:02:59,177
And he's the one
I'm named after.

27
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,111
Lou Lacey.

28
00:03:01,113 --> 00:03:03,113
He died at my mother's wedding.

29
00:03:03,115 --> 00:03:04,683
He had a heart attack
in the bathroom

30
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,085
and somehow know
that they got him out.

31
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:08,218
She didn't know he had died

32
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,090
until she got back
from her honeymoon.

33
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,625
Even though he died
at her wedding.

34
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,695
So that's who I'm named after.

35
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,399
Give him a rock.

36
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:29,240
Sometimes I wonder
who I would be,

37
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,445
if none of this
had ever happened.

38
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,713
If I was still this nice,
white Jewish girl.

39
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,047
from Woodstock, New York.

40
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,788
<i>What would've been
different in my life.</i>

41
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,324
<i>When Lacey was a little girl,</i>

42
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:49,728
<i>we lived a comfortable life.</i>

43
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,396
We lived, almost,

44
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,201
a picture perfect kind of life
for a while.

45
00:03:57,137 --> 00:04:01,740
<i>So when Lacey decided
she was going to tell the story,</i>

46
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:05,042
<i>I was a little nervous about it.</i>

47
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,411
Lacey,
I cannot start without you.

48
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,916
Coming.

49
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,654
It's not too bad.

50
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,024
I'm waiting.

51
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,359
Oh!

52
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:24,161
Wait until you see
what I just found.

53
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:26,330
- What?
- My wedding shoes.

54
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:29,099
What's in there? Anything
I don't wanna know about?

55
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:31,236
Look at the size of these feet.

56
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:34,772
How did that happen? Ha, ha.

57
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:35,741
Put your feet in.

58
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:39,644
Lacey,
there is no way on Earth...

59
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,246
Let's try the left foot.

60
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:44,748
<i>Oh, happy times</i>

61
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,383
<i>They would never...</i>

62
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:48,352
- Did you love them?
- I loved them.

63
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,255
How did you feel
on your wedding day?

64
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:51,823
I felt excited.

65
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,291
- Did you?
- Mm-hm.

66
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,795
Tell me more.

67
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,298
<i>I started going out with daddy</i>

68
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,435
<i>when I was 16 years old.</i>

69
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:07,337
<i>Daddy was the man
I was supposed to be with.</i>

70
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:10,474
<i>Daddy was the person
I grew up with.</i>

71
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,678
<i>Daddy was all that.</i>

72
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:18,886
So tell me about meeting mommy.

73
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:24,222
I was, uh, supervisor
of the Lake and Day camp.

74
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:28,426
And I had this bevy
of gorgeous young teenage girls

75
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,361
under my supervision.

76
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:33,565
<i>Including mommy.</i>

77
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,269
<i>So I just started dating them
one at a time.</i>

78
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,577
<i>And then when I got to mommy
we stuck together.</i>

79
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,281
<i>Grandma decided</i>

80
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:51,849
<i>that this guy would be
the perfect match for me.</i>

81
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,322
<i>Grandma loved his brown eyes
and his eyelashes.</i>

82
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,892
<i>When we went back to Brooklyn</i>

83
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:03,195
<i>after the summer was over,</i>

84
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:04,294
<i>it turns out she lived
in the neighborhood</i>

85
00:06:04,296 --> 00:06:05,395
<i>maybe half a mile away.</i>

86
00:06:05,397 --> 00:06:06,798
<i>We just started going out.</i>

87
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,200
But it was fun. We had fun.

88
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,770
It was nearby,
it was a neighborhood romance.

89
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,742
Everybody saw a stable
and long-lasting couple.

90
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:24,315
<i>I was programmed to marry him.</i>

91
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,782
What do you mean?

92
00:06:25,784 --> 00:06:27,152
<i>He was the path.</i>

93
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:29,219
<i>I went to a city school.</i>

94
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:31,156
<i>I became a teacher.</i>

95
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:34,224
<i>I got married
to a nice Jewish guy.</i>

96
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:36,226
<i>That's the way it was.</i>

97
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:37,762
It's just I've been...

98
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,496
That's what I'm doing,
I'm getting married.

99
00:06:39,498 --> 00:06:41,231
And I'm getting married
to this guy.

100
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:43,368
<i>You just didn't think
outside the box.</i>

101
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,303
<i>We didn't.</i>

102
00:06:44,305 --> 00:06:48,238
<i>And sometimes
it was easier that way.</i>

103
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:59,517
1972, Robert and I
moved to upstate New York.

104
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,953
<i>It was just Robert and me
until 1977.</i>

105
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,924
<i>Then Lacey was born.</i>

106
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,894
<i>My mother
was in labor for 36 hours</i>

107
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,766
<i>before the doctor
finally performed a caesarean.</i>

108
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,200
<i>I saw you first.</i>

109
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:19,971
And there you are.

110
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:22,539
<i>I was so absolutely happy.</i>

111
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,945
<i>You know, I was an uncle.</i>

112
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:30,847
<i>I do remember
seeing you for the first time.</i>

113
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:33,952
<i>Up at the hospital,
in the nursery.</i>

114
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:37,287
And I remember your dad
being very proud

115
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:40,491
of the beautiful baby he had.

116
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,493
<i>And I remember</i>

117
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:48,233
<i>you had a kind of, uh,
yellowish tinge.</i>

118
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:49,633
<i>You did look a little different.</i>

119
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:53,806
But, uh, you know,
it was just how you looked.

120
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:12,489
One day I went to nursery school

121
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:13,991
and there was
this little blond kid

122
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,628
who seemed obsessed
with how I looked.

123
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,998
And he said to me, "Show me
the color of your gums."

124
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,736
And I just showed him my gums,
I was like:

125
00:08:25,604 --> 00:08:29,108
<i>That's the earliest memory
I have of feeling different.</i>

126
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:33,010
<i>It was embarrassing
to be singled out.</i>

127
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,980
<i>And it made me feel ugly.</i>

128
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,885
<i>When I told my parents
what had happened</i>

129
00:08:41,887 --> 00:08:44,489
<i>my father pulled out
an old photo album</i>

130
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,890
<i>and told me I took after
his great grandfather</i>

131
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:48,394
<i>who was Sicilian.</i>

132
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,898
And I saw pictures and I said,

133
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:58,468
"Oh, Lacey looks
like Robert's grandfather."

134
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,305
I just sort of believed
what we were told,

135
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:05,375
that somewhere, I don't know,
in your family history

136
00:09:05,377 --> 00:09:07,511
there was some
explanation for it.

137
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,547
You know, the picture of the...

138
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,015
Sort of like,
large looking, ha, ha...

139
00:09:12,017 --> 00:09:15,122
I don't even know
what we were told he was.

140
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,490
<i>I believed it.</i>

141
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,428
<i>I believed I was white.</i>

142
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,029
We had a reason right there,
in our family tree,

143
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:28,868
of why I looked the way I did.

144
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,875
Ready? She can hit.

145
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:37,574
Go.

146
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,511
Watch it, here he comes.
Get him, get him.

147
00:09:41,513 --> 00:09:43,047
Get him! Get him!

148
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,048
<i>So even though I knew</i>

149
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,083
<i>that there was something
different about me</i>

150
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,385
<i>I didn't want to admit it.</i>

151
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:52,990
<i>I'd find ways
to reassure myself.</i>

152
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,092
<i>I would tell myself</i>

153
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,061
<i>my dad gets really tan
in the summer time,</i>

154
00:09:57,063 --> 00:10:00,564
<i>my mom's hair is really curly
just like mine.</i>

155
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:03,034
And I would find ways
to make it seem like,

156
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:07,239
you know what, I really
was just like my parents.

157
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,443
Show us
how you can stand on your side.

158
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,745
- What?
- Show us that trick.

159
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,645
Oh, great.

160
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:17,981
- Ha, ha.
- Oh, that's terrific.

161
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,485
How do you do that?

162
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,986
Try to hold the camera steady.

163
00:10:22,988 --> 00:10:25,090
So it looks like
I'm not too drunk.

164
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,595
Over there you have Peggy
in her sweat clothes.

165
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:32,831
My new motto:

166
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,732
Late to bed, early to rise
makes a woman extremely ugly.

167
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:37,870
- Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

168
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,140
<i>The diary my parents
gave me on my 11th birthday</i>

169
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,245
<i>makes it pretty clear
I was feeling insecure.</i>

170
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,517
<i>And school only made it worse.</i>

171
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:56,687
<i>All the girls in my class
have long straight hair.</i>

172
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,259
<i>I didn't. And I hated it.</i>

173
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,494
<i>I couldn't do anything
about my skin,</i>

174
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,632
<i>but my hair
was a different story.</i>

175
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,168
Does this look good?

176
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,202
Yes, it does.

177
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,574
I'm just making it
a little flatter.

178
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,208
Let's see
a little happiness. Here we go.

179
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,776
- Walk this way.
- Oh, my gosh.

180
00:11:19,778 --> 00:11:23,481
Oh, that's sweet.
I'm so proud of her.

181
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:26,483
So proud of her,
you have no idea.

182
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:29,088
Today's the day. We did it.

183
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,559
<i>Except for that one conversation</i>

184
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,629
<i>about my great grandfather,</i>

185
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:39,563
<i>my parents and I
never talked about it again.</i>

186
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,669
This is a movie camera, Marty.

187
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,471
It's a movie camera.
I didn't know that.

188
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:48,174
I have never stood so still.
Okay.

189
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,688
Tell Marty to stop cutting.

190
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:09,827
<i>At my bar mitzvah,</i>

191
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,795
<i>a member of the synagogue</i>

192
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,765
<i>came up to me and my mother
and said,</i>

193
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,500
<i>"It's so nice to have
an Ethiopian Jew</i>

194
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,002
<i>in our presence."</i>

195
00:12:19,204 --> 00:12:21,074
<i>My mother said nothing.</i>

196
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,208
<i>So I corrected the woman</i>

197
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,613
<i>and explained
that I wasn't Ethiopian.</i>

198
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,250
<i>But when she walked away,</i>

199
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,353
<i>I remember feeling alone.</i>

200
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,968
I haven't been in Woodstock
for so long.

201
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:50,736
- Hi.
- Ha, ha.

202
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:55,805
Everything is exactly
the same here.

203
00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:58,608
I mean, these guys were here
when I was in high school.

204
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,611
These two
are really feeling it too.

205
00:13:01,613 --> 00:13:03,148
This is authentic...

206
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,751
<i>Woodstock
is a pretty liberal community.</i>

207
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:11,457
<i>But there weren't that many
black people in Woodstock.</i>

208
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,927
Lacey's friends
when she was a child,

209
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:18,464
those were all white kids.

210
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:28,271
<i>There were no black kids
in my elementary school. None.</i>

211
00:13:28,273 --> 00:13:31,342
<i>It was a white world
where race didn't exist for us.</i>

212
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,811
<i>It wasn't really talked about.</i>

213
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,780
So I didn't really think
anything about race.

214
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:39,683
Lacey
is getting ready for her prom.

215
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,986
Fussing as ever.

216
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,990
One, two, three.

217
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,127
Big smile, big smile.

218
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,328
<i>But when I got to high school,</i>

219
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,432
<i>it wasn't so easy to ignore.</i>

220
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,346
This is one cafeteria.

221
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,213
And there, in that room...

222
00:14:10,215 --> 00:14:12,717
And this is another.

223
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:17,888
This room is like stuck in 1996
and it cannot get out.

224
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,193
It looks exactly the same.

225
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,396
<i>I went
to high school in Kingston.</i>

226
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:30,335
<i>One town over from Woodstock
and much more diverse.</i>

227
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,803
<i>Like in high schools everywhere,</i>

228
00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:37,040
<i>the kids found ways
to segregate themselves.</i>

229
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,244
<i>Jocks together,
artsy types together.</i>

230
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,082
<i>Cheerleaders together.</i>

231
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,750
<i>High school was really
the first time in my life</i>

232
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:49,421
<i>that I even crossed path
with black people.</i>

233
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:52,923
<i>In the hallways,
the black kids would stare at me</i>

234
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,659
<i>when I walked past them.</i>

235
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:56,961
<i>It was weird.</i>

236
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:58,395
<i>At first I actually thought</i>

237
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,399
<i>they looked at all
white people that way.</i>

238
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,570
<i>But then I realized, it was me.</i>

239
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:07,904
The black girls
would stop me in the hallway

240
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:09,906
and say, "What are you?"

241
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:12,308
You know, I was offending them.

242
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:16,313
And I would just tell them
that I was white.

243
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,582
That I was...

244
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,686
You know, looks like my great
grandfather was dark skinned.

245
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:23,453
I would tell them I was Jewish.

246
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:25,755
And the black girls in school
would be like,

247
00:15:25,757 --> 00:15:28,292
"Well, you have to work
some stuff out

248
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,760
if you think that, you know,
you're completely white.

249
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:33,297
People definitely asked you.

250
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,833
Are you black or white?
Why are you trying to be white?

251
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:39,102
<i>What those girls
didn't seem to understand was,</i>

252
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,906
<i>I wasn't trying to be white,
I was white.</i>

253
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:45,811
<i>Everyone in my life
had always let me think so.</i>

254
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:49,447
I remember specific situations
where I'll be like,

255
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,448
"Oh, I'm gonna hang out
with my friend Lacey."

256
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,983
And they would be like,
"Oh, Lacey, is she adopted?"

257
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:57,855
And my friend's being like,
"I mean, clearly she's black."

258
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:00,757
And I would be like,
"No, no, no, she's white."

259
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,327
I always looked at you like...

260
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:07,731
You looked black, ha, ha, right?

261
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:11,401
But not that you were, I guess.

262
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,770
You know, it's like
you were my best friend.

263
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:16,807
You looked like you were black,
but I knew both of your parents.

264
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,143
I knew, you know...

265
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:23,347
To me, you're just like
a Jewish kid who...

266
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,850
I don't know.

267
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:30,420
<i>Clearly
you weren't the same as us.</i>

268
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:34,824
But it was, uh,
like a touchy subject.

269
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:36,894
Like...

270
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:38,531
I don't know, like...

271
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:44,135
Something that was never
really comfortable.

272
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:49,140
I don't know if people knew it,
or sensed it, or whatever.

273
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:53,843
It just seems like this
600-pound-gorilla in the room

274
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:57,282
and to kind of just
refuse to see it.

275
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,385
<i>If you look too closely at it,</i>

276
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:04,324
<i>it didn't make any sense.</i>

277
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:07,493
<i>So we didn't look.</i>

278
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,397
<i>We found ways to see
what we wanted to believe.</i>

279
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,737
<i>Meanwhile, at home,</i>

280
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,641
<i>my parents' marriage
started to unravel.</i>

281
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:27,410
<i>At times,
they seemed like peas in a pod.</i>

282
00:17:27,412 --> 00:17:30,814
<i>Other times, I remember
feeling uncomfortable.</i>

283
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,984
They would
argue and argue openly.

284
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,219
Their relationship
was better than most

285
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,420
on the surface.

286
00:17:37,422 --> 00:17:40,090
I don't think I found out
that she wasn't all that happy

287
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,059
until years later.

288
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,960
We did get along for a while

289
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:46,398
and then
we didn't anymore and...

290
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:51,168
And became not married.

291
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,237
I think what I remember
the most clearly

292
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,207
around that time

293
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:59,843
was how your mother

294
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:03,046
seemed literally to go
to pieces.

295
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:06,551
She really fell apart.

296
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,093
<i>When my father
packed up and left,</i>

297
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:20,565
<i>like most kids, I thought
the whole thing was my fault.</i>

298
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,436
<i>But I was afraid to ask.</i>

299
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:30,073
<i>My father was mad at my mother
and mad at the world.</i>

300
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:32,577
<i>And it even seems like
he was mad at me.</i>

301
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,715
- Daddy?
- What?

302
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:41,986
<i>When I was little
we had always been really close.</i>

303
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:44,623
<i>Now I felt abandoned
and rejected by him.</i>

304
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:49,226
<i>Any time I tried
to talk to him about it,</i>

305
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,594
<i>he either freaked out
or ignored me.</i>

306
00:18:51,596 --> 00:18:54,497
<i>And I didn't understand why.</i>

307
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:57,133
You know,
I had such a strong sense,

308
00:18:57,135 --> 00:18:59,903
when my parents were together,
of who I was.

309
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,639
I was their daughter,
and when they split up,

310
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:05,745
I didn't really feel like
I knew who I was.

311
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,718
<i>Then I met Matt.</i>

312
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,688
Hi.

313
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,255
- How are you?
- I'm good.

314
00:19:19,257 --> 00:19:21,992
- How are you?
- I'm good.

315
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,960
- This is a cool place.
- Thank you.

316
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,329
Can I see
the rest of your apartment?

317
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,532
Uh, yes.

318
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:31,134
That is the sometimes office
that is getting rearranged.

319
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:32,535
<i>Matt's father is black.</i>

320
00:19:32,537 --> 00:19:34,638
<i>And his mother is white.</i>

321
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,340
<i>In high school,
when we went out,</i>

322
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:39,112
<i>people would ask
if we were brother and sister.</i>

323
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:41,678
<i>And for the first time</i>

324
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,714
<i>I started to doubt
my parent's story</i>

325
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:47,251
<i>about my dark-skinned
Italian ancestor.</i>

326
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:48,953
I have such a profound memory

327
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:50,286
of looking
at your family pictures

328
00:19:50,288 --> 00:19:51,688
and being like,

329
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,657
"Come on, this is..."

330
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,025
Like, you had the pictures
coming back from Jamaica...

331
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:57,328
<i>With the braids.</i>

332
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,130
<i>And you get so dark.</i>

333
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:03,033
But how absurd it read to me,

334
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:07,271
even as, you know, 16 years old
or something like that.

335
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:10,306
I wasn't like
a man of the world or anything.

336
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:12,642
Your family...?

337
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:16,045
Your cousins and stuff,
and everyone was...?

338
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:18,082
Even the adults?

339
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:20,184
They heard the story
and they went with it.

340
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:22,052
White people
will think anything.

341
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,987
- Ha, ha.
- Crazy things.

342
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,389
I know life can go
for a long time.

343
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,690
You'd just be like, "Wow."

344
00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:28,691
You know, because for me,

345
00:20:28,693 --> 00:20:30,694
I was relatively subconscious
at that time.

346
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:33,663
I think that's how race goes...

347
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,999
It became clear
that there was this denial.

348
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:38,235
I remember
being so struck by it.

349
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:43,674
By the weight of...

350
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:46,342
...that type,
those types of secrets

351
00:20:46,344 --> 00:20:51,215
and it was a couple of years
before we even talked about it.

352
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:53,382
Hello.

353
00:20:53,384 --> 00:20:55,651
<i>Matt really
wanted me to think about it.</i>

354
00:20:55,653 --> 00:20:57,688
<i>He hounded me about it.</i>

355
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,255
<i>He pushed me.</i>

356
00:20:59,257 --> 00:21:00,759
<i>And I pushed back.</i>

357
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:04,227
<i>"I can deal with this now,"
I would say.</i>

358
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:06,598
<i>My parents
were in the middle of a divorce.</i>

359
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:12,504
<i>But deep down, his questions
were getting to me.</i>

360
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,207
<i>When it came time
to apply to college,</i>

361
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:21,812
<i>I decided I wanted to go
to Georgetown.</i>

362
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:25,381
<i>On their application
I had to check a box.</i>

363
00:21:25,383 --> 00:21:28,419
<i>And the only box
I had ever known was white.</i>

364
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:31,721
I didn't know what any
of the others even meant for me.

365
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,224
So I just didn't check anything.

366
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,094
<i>Georgetown required you
to send in a picture,</i>

367
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:39,196
<i>and based off a photograph,</i>

368
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:41,834
<i>I was admitted to college
as a black student.</i>

369
00:21:44,135 --> 00:21:46,703
That moment when Georgetown
said you're black,

370
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,471
it was a moment that...

371
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,140
It was like
they gave me permission

372
00:21:51,142 --> 00:21:54,613
to start entertaining
the idea myself.

373
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,884
<i>So when I got invited</i>

374
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:05,121
<i>to the Black Student Alliance
meeting, I went.</i>

375
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:07,158
<i>And I kept on going.</i>

376
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,195
<i>All through college
and on until law school.</i>

377
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:12,496
My name is Samuel,
I'm from Ethiopia.

378
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,165
I'm Isiah. I'm, uh, 32.

379
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,168
My name is Jelani Jefferson.

380
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,303
I'm from New Orleans.

381
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:20,504
My name's Lacey Schwartz

382
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,542
and I'm from Woodstock,
New York.

383
00:22:28,713 --> 00:22:31,281
I graduated from the University
of Alabama in Birmingham.

384
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,216
<i>And just like that</i>

385
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:34,817
<i>I was welcomed
to the black community.</i>

386
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:37,254
<i>Just because of one photo.</i>

387
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:39,456
<i>Not unlike the photo
of my great grandfather,</i>

388
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,960
<i>who 18 years earlier
had made me white.</i>

389
00:22:44,395 --> 00:22:46,565
<i>It all seemed a little too easy.</i>

390
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,868
<i>But at that point, I was ready
to try on a new identity.</i>

391
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,207
There are different narratives
of racial identity

392
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,877
and people come
with different assumptions

393
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,682
about what is to be
a black person.

394
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:06,216
<i>The university
was like Race 101.</i>

395
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:09,486
<i>A crash course
for a white person</i>

396
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:12,188
<i>on what it means to be black.</i>

397
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,190
<i>I have always
taken it for granted</i>

398
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:15,226
<i>that what I've accomplished</i>

399
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:18,394
<i>was seen as a product
of my own hard work.</i>

400
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:20,796
<i>But I soon realized
that my black friends felt</i>

401
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:24,603
<i>they had to work harder to prove
they deserve their success.</i>

402
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,406
<i>White people don't spend
a whole lot of time</i>

403
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,374
<i>thinking about their whiteness.</i>

404
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,843
<i>But for black people,
blackness is everywhere.</i>

405
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:37,047
<i>It was in the comics
my friends referenced.</i>

406
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:40,484
<i>The music being blasted
in their dorm rooms.</i>

407
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:43,920
<i>And the smack they were talking
while playing cards.</i>

408
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,922
<i>There were moments
in the beginning</i>

409
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,524
<i>where I would walk
into all these black spaces.</i>

410
00:23:48,526 --> 00:23:50,393
<i>And I would think,
how am I gonna fit in?</i>

411
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:52,362
<i>Or what it's gonna be like?</i>

412
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,198
You know, would I dance
in the right way?

413
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,899
And would I say
the right things?

414
00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:58,968
<i>But they didn't know
all about the fact</i>

415
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:03,273
<i>that I had grown up
and only known other white kids.</i>

416
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,942
<i>As it turned out,
hanging out with black people</i>

417
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,844
<i>have put a lot
of my insecurities to rest.</i>

418
00:24:08,846 --> 00:24:10,581
<i>The dark skin
I always worried about,</i>

419
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,549
<i>was light skin to them.</i>

420
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,987
<i>And my bad hair
became good hair.</i>

421
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:19,823
<i>My black friends looked at me
and saw another black person.</i>

422
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:23,459
<i>Feeling like an outsider was
something they could relate to.</i>

423
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:25,930
<i>And it didn't seem like
a coincidence to me.</i>

424
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,999
<i>For the first time in my life,
I felt like I belonged.</i>

425
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:34,105
<i>And somehow I just knew
that black was who I was.</i>

426
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:37,474
<i>Of course that meant</i>

427
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,575
<i>that there was something
my parents weren't telling me.</i>

428
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:42,681
<i>And I had no idea
how to ask them about it.</i>

429
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,850
<i>That's when I went to therapy.</i>

430
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,257
<i>I was taking a film class
at the time,</i>

431
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,394
<i>and decided to tape my sessions.</i>

432
00:24:58,863 --> 00:25:02,632
So I don't know
where you want to begin.

433
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,135
Well, I don't know.

434
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:08,537
Because it's an unspoken thing.

435
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:10,006
Like there's
a part of me that...

436
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,010
I feel like it's a charade.

437
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:14,678
One of the reasons

438
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,979
why you wanted to come
and see me was that I've had...

439
00:25:16,981 --> 00:25:20,383
Not an expertise in secrets,
but I did specialize in that.

440
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:22,854
Secrets create problems.

441
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:27,990
I do lose focus but...
I feel like an outsider.

442
00:25:27,992 --> 00:25:29,659
I can't really tolerate, like,

443
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:32,028
putting myself
to the side anymore.

444
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,532
I feel like things
are becoming so difficult.

445
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,899
I feel just like...

446
00:25:36,901 --> 00:25:40,704
- I am physically exhausted.
- Exhausting.

447
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,406
But I am here

448
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:45,508
to help you
have this conversation.

449
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,012
That you think
you're getting some answers.

450
00:25:58,457 --> 00:26:00,657
I came home
from my freshman year in college

451
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,526
and I decided
that I was gonna ask my mother

452
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:06,063
why I looked the way I did.

453
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:09,666
Lacey came to me and said,
"We have to talk."

454
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:12,936
It was like, "Oh, no."

455
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,038
I'm scared.

456
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,640
She initially didn't wanted
to talk to me about it.

457
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:19,609
She told me
she couldn't do it at that time.

458
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,078
She had to do
something else first.

459
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,246
My reaction was,

460
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:26,949
"Please make her be quiet,
make her stop for a while."

461
00:26:26,951 --> 00:26:28,618
And I told her
I had to talk about it.

462
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,755
I wanted to talk about
why I looked the way I did.

463
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:34,690
Lacey would ask, "How come
you never talked to me about it?

464
00:26:34,692 --> 00:26:37,427
How come nobody
ever talked to me about it?"

465
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,130
And I said to her,
"Mommy, you have to tell me."

466
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:43,697
"How come nobody saw
that I was different?

467
00:26:43,699 --> 00:26:46,136
How come nobody
thought enough to come to me

468
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:49,072
and say I know the truth."

469
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:52,641
And for whatever reason,
I decided that was the moment.

470
00:26:52,643 --> 00:26:54,977
She was pinning me.

471
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:57,447
She wasn't letting me go.

472
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,749
So she sat me down and she said,

473
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,887
"The truth is,
I had an affair with Rodney.

474
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,459
And there's a good chance

475
00:27:10,461 --> 00:27:12,163
that
he's your biological father."

476
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,075
<i>I had known Rodney
for as long as I can remember.</i>

477
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:27,611
<i>My mom had met him
when she was 21</i>

478
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:30,114
<i>and working at a city playground
back in Brooklyn.</i>

479
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:34,583
<i>Rodney
was the king of that park.</i>

480
00:27:34,585 --> 00:27:36,486
<i>And when someone wrote
a book about it,</i>

481
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,257
<i>he became a kind of celebrity.</i>

482
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:41,056
<i>Forty-year-old Rodney Parker</i>

483
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:44,194
<i>has helped a few realize
their dreams of becoming pros.</i>

484
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:46,162
<i>He does promotional work
in city parks</i>

485
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,198
<i>for a sneaker company</i>

486
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,565
<i>but on the side
works as a freelance scout.</i>

487
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:50,601
<i>Apparently for no pay.</i>

488
00:27:50,603 --> 00:27:53,203
<i>Jim McMillian,
forward of the New York Knicks,</i>

489
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:54,838
<i>is his most noted discovery.</i>

490
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,140
Players I help are basically
the underground players,

491
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:58,774
the players
that nobody really looks at.

492
00:27:58,776 --> 00:28:00,610
The kid that's playing
in the playground

493
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,111
who might have more skill
than the other kid

494
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:03,615
playing in the playground.

495
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,816
<i>As a child, as far as I knew,</i>

496
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:09,186
<i>Rodney was a ticket scalper.</i>

497
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,053
<i>So he usually showed up</i>

498
00:28:11,055 --> 00:28:12,788
<i>when my mom and I
would go into the city</i>

499
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,559
<i>for a show or a concert.</i>

500
00:28:16,527 --> 00:28:18,527
<i>A couple of times,
he even got me and my mom</i>

501
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:20,899
<i>and my dad,
tickets to a Knicks game.</i>

502
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,502
<i>I thought he was, uh,
a close friend of your mom's.</i>

503
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:27,070
<i>I knew about the park.</i>

504
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,805
And I knew when
I was desperate for a ticket,

505
00:28:29,807 --> 00:28:35,211
like to the Dylan 25 year
reunion at the Garden,

506
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,679
Rodney was the man.

507
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,883
You remember meeting
Rodney for the first time?

508
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,886
Tell me about meeting Rodney
for the first time.

509
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:46,555
Your mom and I
had gone to the city to...

510
00:28:46,557 --> 00:28:47,623
<i>Shopping.</i>

511
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:50,694
And we were crossing 34th street
and your mom said,

512
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:52,661
"Oh, there's my friend Rodney."

513
00:28:52,663 --> 00:28:55,232
Now, of course,
afterwards I knew

514
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,633
that every time
we ever ran into Rodney

515
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,569
it wasn't like,
"There's my friend Rodney."

516
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,804
It was that she had been
talking to him and she said,

517
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:04,207
"We would be
on 34th street at 2:07."

518
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:06,743
But at that moment
it seemed very co...

519
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,111
"Oh, there's my friend Rodney."

520
00:29:09,113 --> 00:29:12,248
<i>I remember driving home
that day on the FDR</i>

521
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,184
<i>and asking your mom,</i>

522
00:29:13,186 --> 00:29:15,252
<i>"Did you have an affair
with Rodney?"</i>

523
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,719
<i>And she said no.</i>

524
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:19,555
<i>But when I met Rodney</i>

525
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:20,657
<i>I said to myself,</i>

526
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:22,926
<i>"Okay, I get it."</i>

527
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:25,631
That's really
who Lacey looks like.

528
00:29:28,866 --> 00:29:31,735
<i>I really didn't know
what to think.</i>

529
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:35,671
There was a large part of me
that was really relieved.

530
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:38,941
That felt like
I finally knew the truth.

531
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,245
<i>But then I didn't know
what else to say.</i>

532
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:45,148
<i>It really is
the power of denial.</i>

533
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,749
How the hell did you not...?

534
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:47,884
Or, not you.

535
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:51,888
But how did anybody, sort of,
not acknowledge this.

536
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,292
How do you have a daughter
with another man

537
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:58,594
who clearly doesn't look like
anybody in the family.

538
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:02,765
She has the remarkable ability
to look away from things

539
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:04,601
and therefore,
they don't happen.

540
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:07,269
They don't exist,
they are not real.

541
00:30:07,271 --> 00:30:08,804
I remember sitting at the table,

542
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:13,208
at some family function
with Rodney and your mother.

543
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:17,980
And it being so apparent
that this was your father.

544
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:21,719
For my eyes, you know,
I mean, it just seems so clear.

545
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:25,322
And I remember your father
talking about

546
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:28,224
how he had drank a lot
the night before

547
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,694
and Rodney couldn't believe
that he went out for a run

548
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:32,197
that morning.

549
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,631
- I'm like...
- Ha-ha-ha.

550
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:38,701
Dude, that's what
you couldn't believe?

551
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:40,870
That was so weird. Ha, ha.

552
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:44,841
<i>That was as bad as blatantly
throwing it in people's faces</i>

553
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:50,013
<i>as you could do,
and having people look away.</i>

554
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:54,950
<i>My mom had been
lying to me and everyone else</i>

555
00:30:54,952 --> 00:30:56,454
<i>for my entire life.</i>

556
00:30:57,889 --> 00:30:59,688
<i>It seemed pretty obvious to me</i>

557
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,393
<i>the affair had to be a factor
in my parent's divorce.</i>

558
00:31:05,229 --> 00:31:08,333
<i>I was so angry with her
I could barely speak to her.</i>

559
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,338
<i>I couldn't wait
to get back to school.</i>

560
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,720
<i>Now that I knew
that I had a black parent,</i>

561
00:31:31,722 --> 00:31:33,657
<i>that I was actually black,</i>

562
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:34,858
<i>I wasn't sure what to do</i>

563
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,161
<i>with the part of myself
that was white.</i>

564
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:42,998
- Hi.
- Hi.

565
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,734
- Ha, ha.
- Happy birthday.

566
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,869
- Hi.
- Hi.

567
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:50,073
Do you want it up...?

568
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,408
I really like steam my hair
like once a year.

569
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,276
It works
and it's good for bangs.

570
00:31:54,278 --> 00:31:56,746
Oh, really?
More money for travel.

571
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,916
Yeah, I know, I know.

572
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,686
- Um...
- Let me ask you a question.

573
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:04,888
Is being biracial,
half black, half white,

574
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:05,988
a category of being black?

575
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,057
- Like I think of it...
- Definitely.

576
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,892
- Yeah.
- I think of it that way.

577
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:10,893
Like everybody is black.

578
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,928
Is being mixed
is a category of being black,

579
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,098
being mixed to me is not
a category of being white.

580
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,400
It's so funny, because you know
the whole one drop rule, right?

581
00:32:18,402 --> 00:32:20,704
It's like one drop
of black blood you're black.

582
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:23,105
So there's all these people

583
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,108
who we accept...

584
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,044
Like Tiger and his
cabalasian self, you know.

585
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,879
We're like,
"Yeah, we're claiming that."

586
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:30,979
And so it's just...

587
00:32:30,981 --> 00:32:32,881
It is an inclusive...

588
00:32:32,883 --> 00:32:34,883
It's beyond race to me.

589
00:32:34,885 --> 00:32:36,351
Even when
I was in India recently.

590
00:32:36,353 --> 00:32:39,322
It's kind of brown people,
you know,

591
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:41,056
because after there were
no black people

592
00:32:41,058 --> 00:32:42,458
the Indian girl looked cool.

593
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,428
I was like, "Hey, girl."

594
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,832
Ha, ha.
Some brown in the building.

595
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:54,103
It's a common connection
with, um...

596
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:56,939
Sort of being the underdog
in some way,

597
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,207
not being accepted.

598
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:02,044
And really walking into a room
of people, like, I accept you.

599
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:04,413
For me, you know,
I grew up my whole life

600
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:08,450
with people constantly asking me
why I look the way I did.

601
00:33:08,452 --> 00:33:11,487
And maybe I identified
as being black.

602
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,325
So, because I...

603
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,360
Wanted to be part
of the black community.

604
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:22,165
- Yeah.
- Being black feels good for me.

605
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,967
Because it's being true
to yourself.

606
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:27,437
I mean,
it's being true to who you are

607
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:29,906
because it's such
a hodgepodge of people.

608
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:33,543
You can be Lacey from Woodstock.

609
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:37,147
You know, from the parents
of Peggy Schwartz.

610
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:39,849
It's like, "Okay."

611
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:40,984
I think there's power

612
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:43,519
in identifying yourself
as white.

613
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,790
I mean, as making
white folks accept you

614
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:47,890
as part of being white.

615
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:49,926
Mm-hm.

616
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,064
So can we get ready
for my party please?

617
00:33:56,066 --> 00:33:57,499
- Sure, yes.
- Ha-ha-ha.

618
00:34:01,972 --> 00:34:02,871
<i>Being true to myself</i>

619
00:34:02,873 --> 00:34:05,276
<i>meant being
both white and black.</i>

620
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:08,911
<i>When it came to my family,</i>

621
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:11,315
<i>I kept the black part
under wraps.</i>

622
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,884
<i>In my parents' world...</i>

623
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,953
Hallelujah, praise o ye
servants of the eternal.

624
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,522
Praise ye
the name of the eternal.

625
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:21,558
<i>...I was still
a nice Jewish girl.</i>

626
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,996
<i>With two white Jewish parents.</i>

627
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:33,136
<i>After Lacey and I
acknowledged Lacey's parentage.</i>

628
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:36,973
It still wasn't discussed
between Robert and Lacey,

629
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:40,576
and it wasn't discussed
between Robert and me.

630
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,879
<i>So I still was on egg shells</i>

631
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:46,616
<i>and Lacey
was on egg shells also.</i>

632
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,618
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

633
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,756
Dad, I didn't do it on purpose.

634
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:54,459
Sorry, Lucy.

635
00:34:55,926 --> 00:34:57,960
<i>I didn't know
what my father did,</i>

636
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:00,230
<i>or didn't know.</i>

637
00:35:00,232 --> 00:35:01,964
<i>I only knew that being black</i>

638
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:04,001
<i>was connected
to breaking his heart.</i>

639
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,237
It felt really scary.

640
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:10,073
Like, what would happen
if I talked about it?

641
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:12,275
<i>And I was afraid
of not being a part</i>

642
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:14,713
<i>of the world that I have
grown up with anymore.</i>

643
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,250
Hello. Ha, ha.

644
00:35:20,252 --> 00:35:21,516
Hi.

645
00:35:21,518 --> 00:35:22,652
Are they related?

646
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:24,120
They have the same father.

647
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,991
Do they know it?

648
00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:32,228
<i>I kept my white world</i>

649
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,630
<i>and my black world segregated.</i>

650
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,634
<i>But I needed
to keep exploring who I was.</i>

651
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,738
<i>So I tried to get to know
Rodney on my own.</i>

652
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:52,147
<i>After college,
I was living in New York.</i>

653
00:35:52,149 --> 00:35:54,183
<i>So was he.</i>

654
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:56,118
<i>We spent some weekend
afternoons together.</i>

655
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,522
One of my main kids right here.
Chris Andrew.

656
00:36:01,091 --> 00:36:03,125
<i>I wonder
if I would share a bond with him</i>

657
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:04,161
<i>as a black person,</i>

658
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:07,330
<i>that I didn't share
with my white family.</i>

659
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,834
<i>But I didn't feel it.</i>

660
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,370
<i>And as much as I tried,</i>

661
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:14,739
<i>the time I spent with him
didn't change that.</i>

662
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,147
<i>At one point he introduced me</i>

663
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:26,114
<i>to his other children.</i>

664
00:36:26,116 --> 00:36:29,319
<i>He had seven
by a few different women.</i>

665
00:36:29,321 --> 00:36:32,955
<i>Kristin was the youngest
and closest to my age.</i>

666
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:36,292
<i>She had also grown up
as an only child.</i>

667
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:39,661
<i>Now, suddenly, we were sisters.</i>

668
00:36:39,663 --> 00:36:41,163
So like
to finally have a sister,

669
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:43,165
I was like, "Yeah,
I can see the resemblance."

670
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:46,002
I guess for me
was, um, you know...

671
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:47,569
<i>And we spent
some time together</i>

672
00:36:47,571 --> 00:36:49,339
<i>and I just didn't feel
the connection.</i>

673
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:51,574
<i>To her, or to Rodney.</i>

674
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:53,009
It wasn't her. It was just...

675
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:55,377
They were strangers to me.

676
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,612
So do you wear your hair
curly mostly?

677
00:36:57,614 --> 00:37:00,185
- Like almost solely.
- Yeah.

678
00:37:05,622 --> 00:37:07,625
<i>I didn't know where I belonged.</i>

679
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,431
<i>Rodney was not my father.</i>

680
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:17,568
<i>And my real father had no idea
who I actually was.</i>

681
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:43,792
<i>Then, shortly before
my 30th birthday,</i>

682
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:47,598
<i>my mother called and told me
that Rodney had died.</i>

683
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:11,319
Hi.

684
00:38:11,321 --> 00:38:13,089
- How are you?
- Morris.

685
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:14,790
- Hello.
- This is my daughter Lacey.

686
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,658
- Hi.
- Hey, Lacey, how you doing?

687
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,795
I'm fine. How are you?

688
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:19,730
- Hi.
- You don't know me.

689
00:38:19,732 --> 00:38:22,198
- I'm Albert King.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

690
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,399
He was a great man.

691
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,667
It's so nice to meet you.

692
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:26,134
- My name is Robert.
- Hi.

693
00:38:26,136 --> 00:38:28,437
I've got many memories
of your dad.

694
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,205
- Here's my card...
- Thank you.

695
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:32,208
You're one
of Rodney's daughters also?

696
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,308
Yeah.

697
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:41,451
You're not the one
I drove down to Manhattan?

698
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:43,685
- That played the piano?
- No.

699
00:38:43,687 --> 00:38:45,721
I need a scorecard
to keep track...

700
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,223
- Scorecard?
- Ha-ha-ha.

701
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:48,927
I need an encyclopedia.

702
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:00,705
This is so strange.

703
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,283
<i>I sat
with Rodney's other children</i>

704
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:15,786
<i>in the front row.</i>

705
00:39:17,187 --> 00:39:18,956
<i>But I felt out of place.</i>

706
00:39:22,192 --> 00:39:26,228
I recite this poem
to my black brothers.

707
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,998
It says I wanna be my own man...

708
00:39:29,399 --> 00:39:30,732
<i>Behind me was my mother</i>

709
00:39:30,734 --> 00:39:33,805
<i>and some other family members
who have come to support her.</i>

710
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:39,442
<i>If any of them knew that Rodney
was my biological father,</i>

711
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:41,846
<i>none of them
had ever said so to me.</i>

712
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,448
Rodney is survived
by his daughters,

713
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:48,551
Suzette Michelle Parker,
Kristin Marissa Parker

714
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:52,388
and Lacey Schwartz,
son Rodney James Parker...

715
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,223
When I was announced

716
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:57,225
as one of his children
during the service,

717
00:39:57,227 --> 00:39:59,362
I knew
that there was no going back.

718
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:03,068
That everyone in my white family
then knew that I was black.

719
00:40:07,504 --> 00:40:09,772
- How are you?
- It's weird.

720
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:10,906
It's weird.

721
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,775
Are you sure?

722
00:40:13,777 --> 00:40:15,714
- Are you hanging in there?
- Yeah.

723
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:18,882
It's just weird.

724
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,554
<i>My cousins were there.</i>

725
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:26,422
<i>My friends that were there.</i>

726
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:30,560
<i>And it was a very
uncomfortable situation.</i>

727
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:33,395
<i>Lacey knew that her family</i>

728
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:37,433
<i>would be watching her
and seeing how she reacted.</i>

729
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:41,773
<i>But nobody discussed it openly.</i>

730
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:57,652
<i>The funeral was the last straw.</i>

731
00:40:57,654 --> 00:41:01,524
<i>But my family seemed fine
to pretend about who I was.</i>

732
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:03,328
<i>But I was done letting them.</i>

733
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:06,429
I remember the very first time

734
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:09,864
that I ever put
two and two together.

735
00:41:09,866 --> 00:41:13,268
When I started realizing
that you were kind of changing.

736
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,870
Not certainly who you
associated yourself with or...

737
00:41:15,872 --> 00:41:17,505
Not associated yourself with,

738
00:41:17,507 --> 00:41:20,542
but how you viewed
yourself or...

739
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:22,645
And I think that's kind of
when I started thinking

740
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:28,583
that race was gonna play
a bigger role.

741
00:41:28,585 --> 00:41:31,987
Do you feel it necessary
to say to yourself,

742
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,024
I've made a decision,
I am a white woman.

743
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:36,625
Or I am a black woman.

744
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,594
Or I am a combination of each
or is it...?

745
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:41,464
Yeah, I think of myself as,
like, somebody who's biracial

746
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:42,964
and half of my race is black.

747
00:41:42,966 --> 00:41:46,534
I think of myself,
like I'm a category of black.

748
00:41:46,536 --> 00:41:48,937
I don't identify as being white.

749
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:50,841
Okay, that's fair.

750
00:41:52,609 --> 00:41:55,444
I mean,
do you think of me as black?

751
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:57,013
Today I think is the first time

752
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:59,681
that you and I have ever spoken
those words to each other.

753
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,516
To say like
do I think of you as black...

754
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:04,020
Like, what does that mean?

755
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:07,690
- I mean, how do you view me?
- As my cousin.

756
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:11,029
I was naive to any concept of...

757
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:14,696
For lack
of a better descriptor, race.

758
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:19,634
I never really viewed you
as white or black or anything.

759
00:42:19,636 --> 00:42:21,571
And I could never really

760
00:42:21,573 --> 00:42:23,605
with something
that I even thought about.

761
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:25,540
Well, I think of you as black

762
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:28,076
because I think
you think of yourself as black.

763
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:30,448
I think mostly
I think of you as Lacey.

764
00:42:31,683 --> 00:42:37,386
My father and I have never
talked about, in anyway,

765
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:42,391
my paternity, my race...

766
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,726
- Anything.
- How bizarre is that?

767
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,432
You know, I mean, really?

768
00:42:49,933 --> 00:42:51,933
I'm worried
about who I'm talking to.

769
00:42:51,935 --> 00:42:54,502
How do I say to him,

770
00:42:54,504 --> 00:42:55,937
I need to talk to you.

771
00:42:55,939 --> 00:42:57,440
A good thing
that I promised myself

772
00:42:57,442 --> 00:42:59,841
because I would never
have children.

773
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:01,344
And they will be on, like,
the New York State Freeway,

774
00:43:01,346 --> 00:43:02,444
on the way up, and say,

775
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:05,082
"Like, remember, grandpa
doesn't know mommy's black."

776
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:17,092
Dad, I really wanna talk to you.

777
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,395
When I...

778
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:22,565
I think there's a lot
to talk about

779
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:24,734
and I think that...

780
00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:26,237
You know...

781
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:29,371
I would say...

782
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:30,875
God...

783
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:36,645
I mean,
it's two conversations...

784
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,080
There are certain things
I need to get out of the way.

785
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:39,382
There are certain things

786
00:43:39,384 --> 00:43:40,982
I would like
to talk to you about.

787
00:43:40,984 --> 00:43:43,451
But there's a difference
between saying what I like to do

788
00:43:43,453 --> 00:43:44,553
and what I need to do.

789
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:46,121
And one of the things
that I realized

790
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,926
that I need to say...

791
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:53,097
...is I need to openly
acknowledge to you...

792
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,998
...that I identify
as a black woman.

793
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,467
What a surprise.

794
00:43:59,469 --> 00:44:01,002
But I've never said that
to you, Dad.

795
00:44:01,004 --> 00:44:02,840
Well, you didn't have to.

796
00:44:08,446 --> 00:44:10,413
- And the reason...
- I see the books you read.

797
00:44:10,415 --> 00:44:13,047
I see the relationships
you have.

798
00:44:13,049 --> 00:44:15,150
I see the music you like.

799
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,522
I see the, uh...

800
00:44:19,122 --> 00:44:23,260
The entertainment realm
that appeals to you.

801
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,763
Okay. What else is new?

802
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:29,267
I knew that.

803
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:42,178
In the end
I just felt dismissed by him.

804
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,478
Like, he didn't...

805
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,080
Like maybe
he was ashamed of me.

806
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:46,584
Like he didn't want to...

807
00:44:48,051 --> 00:44:50,719
He wasn't willing
to go there with me.

808
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:54,058
And I felt like I so desperately
needed to understand.

809
00:44:55,493 --> 00:44:58,930
<i>And so I decided I had
to really talk to my mother.</i>

810
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:06,201
Hey.

811
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:10,638
The operative word
in "we have to unload" is we.

812
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,507
Okay.

813
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,210
- All right.
- Okay.

814
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,212
I think that's all
from the back, right?

815
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,681
- I think we're done.
- Mom.

816
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:22,116
When you got married,
you got married in what year?

817
00:45:22,118 --> 00:45:23,819
1968.

818
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:27,089
In 1968,
and then you lived where?

819
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:28,556
Uh, Forest Hills.

820
00:45:28,558 --> 00:45:30,558
Did you know Rodney
before that or after that?

821
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,129
I met Rodney when I got a job
in the Parks Department.

822
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:36,130
What year did you get a job
in Parks Department?

823
00:45:36,132 --> 00:45:37,266
1968.

824
00:45:37,268 --> 00:45:39,237
The same year you got married.

825
00:45:44,642 --> 00:45:46,143
Yes.

826
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,647
Because then
I wasn't born until '77.

827
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:53,915
Right.

828
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,653
When were you first with him?

829
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:02,824
Mother, just tell me.

830
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:04,859
1968.

831
00:46:04,861 --> 00:46:06,663
Before or after you got married?

832
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,433
Before.

833
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:13,768
Oh, my God. Ha, ha.

834
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,270
When did you tell daddy

835
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,239
that you've been having
an affair with Rodney?

836
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:18,743
I never did.

837
00:46:22,712 --> 00:46:24,647
Did daddy know?

838
00:46:24,649 --> 00:46:26,714
Yes.

839
00:46:26,716 --> 00:46:29,284
You know about the time
when his wife attacked me?

840
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,920
What?

841
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:32,855
This is what happened.

842
00:46:32,857 --> 00:46:34,891
There was Rodney,
and there was his wife.

843
00:46:34,893 --> 00:46:37,259
And his wife and I
were kind of friendly.

844
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:39,962
But obviously she found out
that there was...

845
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,696
Whatever else was happening.

846
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:43,598
So Rodney's wife
came to visit me

847
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,167
and she and I
were sitting in the car

848
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:47,169
and all of a sudden
she takes out a razor blade.

849
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:49,904
- Oh!
- She takes out a razor blade.

850
00:46:49,906 --> 00:46:51,774
Can you see this?

851
00:46:51,776 --> 00:46:53,975
Can you see this going up here?

852
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,245
Here. See that?

853
00:46:56,247 --> 00:46:57,179
No way.

854
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:59,181
- I didn't know this story.
- And...

855
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:00,315
This was before I was born?

856
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,518
Yeah.

857
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,886
Well, anyway,
so she takes out a razor blade.

858
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:07,623
And this is gonna burn.

859
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:10,192
And she goes to slash me
in the face.

860
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:12,895
So I go like this.

861
00:47:12,897 --> 00:47:14,399
So...

862
00:47:16,232 --> 00:47:18,736
Now, the police come
and they arrest her.

863
00:47:20,236 --> 00:47:22,203
So...

864
00:47:22,205 --> 00:47:23,272
Of course, I...

865
00:47:23,274 --> 00:47:25,873
Did you tell daddy
Rodney's wife tried to slash me?

866
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:27,141
Yes.

867
00:47:27,143 --> 00:47:29,678
Did daddy already know you were
having an affair with Rodney?

868
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,812
No.

869
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:32,948
Until you got slashed?

870
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:37,786
He basically said to me then,

871
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:40,056
"You know,
whatever has happened,

872
00:47:40,058 --> 00:47:42,060
let's put it aside and let's go
about our business."

873
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,228
And that was
the last conversation we had

874
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,732
about that.

875
00:47:51,636 --> 00:47:54,902
Fact is, if the man
with whom I had an affair

876
00:47:54,904 --> 00:47:58,341
had not been black,
none of this would've come out.

877
00:48:21,364 --> 00:48:24,033
<i>A lifetime of lies
had torn my family apart.</i>

878
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,404
<i>I hope
that talking about the truth</i>

879
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,109
<i>could put it back together.</i>

880
00:48:39,015 --> 00:48:41,817
<i>First saved message.</i>

881
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:43,719
<i>Hi, Lacey. It's dad.</i>

882
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:46,788
<i>Um, been giving some thought
about our conversation.</i>

883
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,824
<i>And, uh...</i>

884
00:48:48,826 --> 00:48:51,794
<i>It's not a good time for me
to talk to you.</i>

885
00:48:51,796 --> 00:48:54,395
<i>So, um, not wanting to introduce</i>

886
00:48:54,397 --> 00:48:57,332
<i>new sources of stress
and complications.</i>

887
00:48:57,334 --> 00:49:00,301
<i>So we have to pick a time</i>

888
00:49:00,303 --> 00:49:03,871
<i>when I feel, uh, more calm</i>

889
00:49:03,873 --> 00:49:05,741
<i>and peaceful about my life.</i>

890
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:08,042
<i>Right now,
I'm pretty stressed out.</i>

891
00:49:08,044 --> 00:49:10,078
<i>I haven't shared things
with you, so...</i>

892
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,182
<i>Talk to you later, bye.</i>

893
00:49:22,026 --> 00:49:24,926
<i>The more my father
pushed me away,</i>

894
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:27,430
<i>the more I press my mother
for details.</i>

895
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,933
- This is it.
- That one?

896
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:34,372
As I remember
walking on the street.

897
00:49:35,406 --> 00:49:36,940
There it is.

898
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:44,011
So this is where I worked.

899
00:49:44,013 --> 00:49:45,480
This is were... This is it?

900
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,783
This is it.

901
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:49,484
What was this neighborhood
like then?

902
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:52,087
It was just the way it is now.

903
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:53,989
It's exactly what it was like.

904
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,391
This was a black neighborhood.

905
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:58,460
- Yeah.
- Apparently it still is.

906
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:01,096
- What I'm saying...
- Ha-ha-ha.

907
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:02,998
When you first
started working here,

908
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,766
were you like,
"What am I doing here?"

909
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:05,835
I had no clue what I was doing.

910
00:50:05,837 --> 00:50:09,437
I was 21 years old,
and I was white and Jewish,

911
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:11,474
and I was in charge
of this playground.

912
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:15,844
See, right up there?
That's where Rodney lived.

913
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,547
- Oh, he lived right here?
- He lived right there.

914
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:21,516
See the top floor?

915
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,118
Here's the thing about Rodney.

916
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:27,054
It was very appealing to know
that there was somebody

917
00:50:27,056 --> 00:50:30,294
who I could snap my fingers
and he would come running.

918
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:35,496
- So after I was born...
- Mm-hm.

919
00:50:35,498 --> 00:50:39,400
When did you think you realized
that I was Rodney's daughter.

920
00:50:39,402 --> 00:50:41,569
Well, let's back up.

921
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:43,373
We know the infamous...

922
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:47,511
Daddy and the grandfather.

923
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:52,013
Daddy
and the Sicilian grandfather.

924
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:53,214
- Yes.
- You know that.

925
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,417
I wanted to believe that
so badly,

926
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,585
that I probably
latched on to that.

927
00:50:57,587 --> 00:51:01,359
So I was able to
kind of not think about it.

928
00:51:03,027 --> 00:51:06,194
And then Rodney would say,

929
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:08,163
"Look at that kid,
she looks just like me."

930
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:10,866
And I would say,
"No, she doesn't."

931
00:51:10,868 --> 00:51:15,036
It took me years to say to him,
"Yeah, you're right, she does."

932
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:19,174
And it wasn't
because I was lying.

933
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:21,909
I mean, I didn't see it, really.

934
00:51:21,911 --> 00:51:24,612
And then,
maybe once I started seeing it,

935
00:51:24,614 --> 00:51:26,651
I chose to ignore it.

936
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:32,020
But he would talk about it
and...

937
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:33,589
So when I finally
got to the point

938
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:36,190
that I had to be honest
with myself,

939
00:51:36,192 --> 00:51:38,560
I couldn't deny it,

940
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:40,862
I would say,
"Robert is her father.

941
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:43,464
Robert is her father, Robert
is the person that raised her,

942
00:51:43,466 --> 00:51:46,902
Robert is the person that
was there with her everyday.

943
00:51:46,904 --> 00:51:49,237
Robert is the person
who attends school functions.

944
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:51,075
Robert is her father."

945
00:51:53,509 --> 00:51:55,779
So why did you stay with daddy?

946
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,946
The reason was,

947
00:51:58,948 --> 00:52:03,085
I had an extremely
sexual relationship with Rodney,

948
00:52:03,087 --> 00:52:04,953
but there were things missing.

949
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,621
- Like...
- The fact is...

950
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:10,958
That daddy was interesting,
daddy was funny.

951
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,527
Daddy was a person

952
00:52:13,529 --> 00:52:15,563
who made
a decent amount of money.

953
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:18,069
That's the reason
I stayed with daddy.

954
00:52:21,105 --> 00:52:23,237
How much do you think
the fact that Rodney

955
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:27,009
was not a real option for you
had to do with him being black?

956
00:52:27,011 --> 00:52:30,145
I think it had nothing
to do with it whatsoever.

957
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,513
Nothing? How can it have
nothing to do with it?

958
00:52:32,515 --> 00:52:34,516
I don't know,
you asked me this before.

959
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:37,118
- Think about it!
- I can't.

960
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,221
You're asking me,
I'm telling you the truth.

961
00:52:39,223 --> 00:52:43,692
It had nothing to do with it
whatsoever.

962
00:52:43,694 --> 00:52:44,659
You know, the fact is,

963
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:47,094
that whatever happened
with you and daddy,

964
00:52:47,096 --> 00:52:49,230
and that inability
to talk about things,

965
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:51,299
that is what I carry on.

966
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:54,136
So much of what I did
was connected to who I was,

967
00:52:54,138 --> 00:52:55,703
and nobody talked about
who I was.

968
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:57,940
I can't talk to daddy
about who I am.

969
00:52:57,942 --> 00:53:00,308
I can't talk to daddy
about who I am until...

970
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:02,611
You know, it's not like
being black is everything.

971
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:03,679
But it's part of who I am.

972
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:06,714
And if I can't share
all of who I am with him...

973
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:08,716
And why can't I share
all of who I am with him?

974
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:10,152
Because you had an affair.

975
00:53:10,154 --> 00:53:11,987
Because nobody
talks about everything.

976
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:13,524
Because it was all secrets.

977
00:53:27,303 --> 00:53:30,371
<i>I think your dad
was in great agony.</i>

978
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:33,176
<i>Some of which he shared with me,
some of which he didn't.</i>

979
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:35,710
<i>When you were 16,</i>

980
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:38,179
<i>he said something to me
that was very poignant.</i>

981
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:41,616
He said,
"My whole life was a lie."

982
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:44,018
He said, "I lived a lie."

983
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,054
Right.

984
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:49,290
I think, you know,
your father saw you everyday

985
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:51,726
as living proof

986
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:55,098
that your mom
had betrayed the marriage.

987
00:53:56,132 --> 00:54:00,002
<i>He was this center
of this huge secret</i>

988
00:54:00,004 --> 00:54:03,004
<i>that was circling around him.</i>

989
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:06,107
<i>It was a big thing
that happened to him.</i>

990
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:08,643
Maybe he was never able
to separate

991
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:12,583
that act happening to him
from you.

992
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:21,825
I know that there is something
that was lost between us.

993
00:54:23,227 --> 00:54:24,725
When we each found out

994
00:54:24,727 --> 00:54:26,763
that I wasn't
his biological child.

995
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:29,799
<i>How do I get past that?</i>

996
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:40,375
Good morning, Father.
Give me a hug.

997
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,762
Ain't that...?

998
00:55:01,098 --> 00:55:03,500
It's no secret
that mommy had an affair.

999
00:55:04,835 --> 00:55:06,637
She ever tell you she did?

1000
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:14,275
She never talked to me
even about that.

1001
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:16,078
And da-da-da-da...

1002
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,411
And life goes on.

1003
00:55:17,413 --> 00:55:20,348
Our merry way
of poor communication

1004
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,920
and chaos and...

1005
00:55:24,288 --> 00:55:26,657
I mean, don't you think
she should have told me?

1006
00:55:29,158 --> 00:55:31,393
Yeah.

1007
00:55:31,395 --> 00:55:35,763
But my question for you is,
once you and mommy got divorced,

1008
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:37,299
why did you never talk to me

1009
00:55:37,301 --> 00:55:39,234
about not being
my biological father?

1010
00:55:39,236 --> 00:55:40,201
About what?

1011
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:42,304
About not being
my biological father. Why...?

1012
00:55:42,306 --> 00:55:45,306
Because it was mommy's business.

1013
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:46,708
I didn't have a clue.

1014
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,777
I would always tell people,

1015
00:55:48,779 --> 00:55:50,712
"Oh, yeah,
my grandfather's Italian.

1016
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:52,714
He passed his looks on to you."

1017
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:54,783
And I believed it.

1018
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:56,451
I didn't tell you
because I didn't fucking know

1019
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:59,221
until you turned 16.

1020
00:55:59,223 --> 00:56:02,457
Talk about betrayal.
It's the ultimate.

1021
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:05,296
Cheat on your husband.
Okay, that's pretty bad.

1022
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,196
Don't tell him
that you're having

1023
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,464
somebody else's child
for 16 years?

1024
00:56:10,466 --> 00:56:12,167
Or forever for that matter.

1025
00:56:12,169 --> 00:56:14,870
She still hasn't told me
but we all know.

1026
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:17,241
Talk about
the ultimate betrayal.

1027
00:56:19,243 --> 00:56:21,243
Talk about
the ultimate betrayal.

1028
00:56:21,245 --> 00:56:22,746
Just think about that.

1029
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:31,453
You had no idea how things were.

1030
00:56:31,455 --> 00:56:33,355
- You're right, I didn't.
- Ahem.

1031
00:56:33,357 --> 00:56:35,255
You're right.

1032
00:56:35,257 --> 00:56:37,458
Maybe you and mommy
had a relationship

1033
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:40,295
where you didn't talk
about things.

1034
00:56:40,297 --> 00:56:42,565
But I'm not that person.

1035
00:56:42,567 --> 00:56:46,500
And there is absolutely
no question for either of us

1036
00:56:46,502 --> 00:56:48,203
who you are to me as my father

1037
00:56:48,205 --> 00:56:50,172
and who I am to you
as your daughter.

1038
00:56:50,174 --> 00:56:52,908
I think
it has been difficult for me

1039
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,775
to acknowledge
certain aspects of my life

1040
00:56:54,777 --> 00:56:57,846
because it implicated things
that we didn't talk about.

1041
00:56:57,848 --> 00:57:01,516
And I have not shared with you

1042
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:03,585
certain aspects of my life.

1043
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:06,390
And, like, going forward,
I want to change that.

1044
00:57:08,457 --> 00:57:09,924
Okay. Well, time will tell.

1045
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:12,028
Let that play out.

1046
00:57:22,538 --> 00:57:24,940
<i>After I finally
talked to my father,</i>

1047
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:28,442
<i>I realized, in my mind,
I had this visual</i>

1048
00:57:28,444 --> 00:57:30,444
<i>that we were all going
to heal together.</i>

1049
00:57:30,446 --> 00:57:32,915
<i>And we're all gonna move forward
with our lives.</i>

1050
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:40,957
<i>But in the end,
I couldn't heal my parents.</i>

1051
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:44,592
I couldn't change
what had happened to them.

1052
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:48,330
I couldn't make them feel
differently about it.

1053
00:57:48,332 --> 00:57:52,533
I needed to accept them
for who they were.

1054
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:55,905
Just like I wanted them
to accept who I was.

1055
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:07,449
Mom, you really wanna go through

1056
00:58:07,451 --> 00:58:08,549
all those boxes tonight?

1057
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:10,484
We have a whole other box to do.

1058
00:58:10,486 --> 00:58:12,453
Yeah, maybe we should skip it.

1059
00:58:12,455 --> 00:58:14,589
Let's go.

1060
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:16,393
Here are your engagement...

1061
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,362
This is definitely
daddy's handwriting.

1062
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:23,297
Look at this.
This is what he wrote.

1063
00:58:23,299 --> 00:58:25,866
"I never really read
too carefully any card,

1064
00:58:25,868 --> 00:58:29,036
but this card says
just what you mean to me.

1065
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:31,940
I love you, Peggy Susan."

1066
00:58:31,942 --> 00:58:33,475
God, were daddy and I corny.

1067
00:58:33,477 --> 00:58:35,476
Or at least I was.

1068
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:37,080
I loved daddy then.

1069
00:58:41,917 --> 00:58:44,685
- What is this?
- This was my wedding dress.

1070
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,388
Oh, my God.

1071
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:49,357
That must have been my bouquet.

1072
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:52,560
My God. Lacey, look.

1073
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:54,562
This was
our engagement announcement.

1074
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:56,364
Because we got engaged on May 6.

1075
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,402
I think we separated on May 8.

1076
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:05,174
Whoa. Ha, ha.

1077
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:13,948
If I could have done
my life differently,

1078
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:16,650
would I have had
a committed marriage.

1079
00:59:16,652 --> 00:59:20,955
Yes, I would have taken care
of my marriage or gotten out.

1080
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:23,357
But if I had done that,
I wouldn't have had you.

1081
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:26,460
So there are a lot of things
I would have done differently,

1082
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:29,698
but in the end, not really.

1083
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:31,433
But the dangerous thing is,

1084
00:59:31,435 --> 00:59:35,103
when you have a marriage
that's troubled,

1085
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:36,670
and you have somebody else,

1086
00:59:36,672 --> 00:59:38,573
you never take care
of your problems

1087
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,775
because you don't have to.

1088
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:41,976
Because you can just ignore it
and go about your business

1089
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:45,746
and this other person will make
you feel really wonderful.

1090
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:49,551
But sometimes you do things
that are just of the moment.

1091
00:59:49,553 --> 00:59:51,085
And you're not...

1092
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,953
It's not like
you're being hedonistic

1093
00:59:52,955 --> 00:59:55,422
or being mean or being horrible.

1094
00:59:55,424 --> 00:59:57,125
It's just at the moment

1095
00:59:57,127 --> 01:00:01,062
and you're not really aware

1096
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:03,200
of the consequences.

1097
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:15,710
But before I was your mother,
I was a person.

1098
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:18,482
And I was a girl,
and I was a woman...

1099
01:00:19,982 --> 01:00:21,484
And I was me.

1100
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:26,020
And I think that's
the most honest explanation

1101
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:27,524
I could give you.

1102
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,830
But that's the truth.

1103
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:12,065
That looks beautiful.

1104
01:01:12,067 --> 01:01:14,270
- Walk around here.
- Over here.

1105
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,440
<i>I've spent
the first half of my life</i>

1106
01:01:18,442 --> 01:01:21,545
<i>being defined by the world
my parents have created for me.</i>

1107
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:27,181
<i>In the second half,</i>

1108
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:30,219
<i>I was defined
by their secrets and lies.</i>

1109
01:01:41,665 --> 01:01:43,600
<i>But the truth
is on the table now.</i>

1110
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:50,172
<i>And I was ready to find
my future for myself.</i>

1111
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:03,053
This is a celebration of love.

1112
01:02:05,187 --> 01:02:09,123
It's a celebration
that brings two individuals

1113
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:11,091
from different
cultural experiences

1114
01:02:11,093 --> 01:02:12,694
and different
religious experiences.

1115
01:02:12,696 --> 01:02:16,698
And so love allows them
to come together

1116
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,900
and fall in love with each other

1117
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:21,835
and had transcended
the external accidents

1118
01:02:21,837 --> 01:02:24,341
of race or color.

1119
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:29,576
<i>I put a lot of thought</i>

1120
01:02:29,578 --> 01:02:31,948
<i>into the issue
of changing my last name.</i>

1121
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:35,917
<i>As a kid
I never really liked Schwartz.</i>

1122
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:39,989
<i>But now, after everything,
it seemed perfect for me.</i>

1123
01:02:41,892 --> 01:02:46,029
<i>A clearly Jewish name
that literally means black.</i>

1124
