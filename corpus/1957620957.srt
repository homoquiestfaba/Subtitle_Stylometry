00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:53,280
He's a damn good cop.

173
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:55,048
And?

174
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:56,449
Well, they say he was set up.

175
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:59,352
He was acquitted,
but he resigned anyway.

176
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,121
To become a bounty hunter.

177
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,422

178
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:05,525
But if he was innocent,
why didn't he just stay
on the Force?

179
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,929
Because they questioned
his integrity.

180
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:11,531
And I can't say
that I blame him.

181
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,968
Well, just as well,
the guy was always
a lone wolf.

182
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,139
You could take
a few lessons from him.

183
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,774
Great job, Logan.

184
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:23,911

pretty well hidden
there for a month.

process your reward
first thing in the morning.

Now, you see, that's what I
like about you, my friend.

187
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,220
You cut through
all the red tape and the BS.

-The feeling's mutual, buddy.

What you gonna do
to that boy Angel?

190
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:39,927
I'm gonna send him
to the city jail.

191
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,161
We can nail him this time.

192
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,130

suspicion of murder,

193
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:44,998

of other charges.

never ask.

We're asking now, Blade.

206
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:16,529
Angel had a little help
from his friends.

207
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:19,599
He knew what they
were doing, too,
very military.

208

-One guy was a mercenary.
-Mercenary?

but I don't think

for quite some time.

00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:19,985
A minute with me
or five years with The Man.

678
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:22,521
You call it.

679
00:40:23,188 --> 00:40:24,189

Here.

684
00:40:37,603 --> 00:40:40,506
What about that CD
you promised us?

685
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:42,974
-The microwave.
-And the movie role.

686
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,075
Yeah, what about
the movie role?

687
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:45,911
Maybe we'll talk... Talk
about it later, all right?

688
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:47,746
We'll talk about it
later, hmm?

689
00:40:51,216 --> 00:40:52,751
Next bus to Hoboken.

00:41:03,629 --> 00:41:05,497
-Movie role, huh?

00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:08,934
-Hey, man, what the...
-Now, you listen,
you little weasel.

692
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,637
I could bust you
with just one phone call.

693
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,472
One phone call.
So don't break my balls.

694
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,509
Now, I want the truth.

695
00:41:17,543 --> 00:41:18,844
What did you see last night?

696
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:22,914
Okay, but only for you
'cause you're cool.

697
00:41:22,948 --> 00:41:25,183
Cut the crap. Talk.

698
00:41:30,556 --> 00:41:32,524
These dudes were tight.

699
00:41:32,558 --> 00:41:34,125
They was jamming.

700
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,662
Look like something
out of some John Wayne movie.

701
00:41:36,695 --> 00:41:38,664
You know, Iwo Jima and shit.

702
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:39,565
Diablos?

703
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:41,132
It could have been
Martians for all I know.

704
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,768
They were wearing gas masks.

705
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:45,270
Angel's dudes, they got
their thing together.

706
00:41:46,672 --> 00:41:47,973
Anything else?

707
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:53,779
No, no more.
I don't know nothing.

708
00:41:53,812 --> 00:41:55,947

You gonna back me up?

711

Try me.

712
00:42:07,292 --> 00:42:10,562
Word on the street
is Angel is backed
by the Columbians.

713
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:12,297
Big boys, Blade.

714
00:42:13,098 --> 00:42:14,299
Big boys.

715
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:17,102
You sure about this?

00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:19,170
It's the truth.

Why you sit?
Who told you to sit?

720
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:04,983
I came to collect, Benny.

721
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:07,018
You owe me.

722
00:43:07,052 --> 00:43:08,754
Yeah, I owe you.
I know I owe you.

you're in my fucking face.

What, huh? What?

725
00:43:15,661 --> 00:43:17,028
I need to talk to Don Mario.

726
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:20,732

what happened last night?

This is a big fucking favor
you're asking me.

00:43:42,721 --> 00:43:44,723
I kept you out of lockup.

It's Blade, 
 I'm worried about him.

You're a cop. You're supposed
to be our pipeline,

755
00:44:49,755 --> 00:44:52,758
He could find out about 
 my involvement with you.

They call him the

 that name himself.

you got a plan, huh?

in a 10-year war,

the Trojan horse.

Who needs horses, man?

horses, man, my boys don't
know about horses, man.

good that's gonna feel, Blade.

and cleaner than your

on his head, and I want him.

I mean, why should
I give him to you?

will be spilled, sir.

Good Samaritan?

you don't kill cops.

These animals do.
Let me find them.

I'm gonna let you do.

out of my face and stay out of

an army base near Saigon.

01:04:29,934 --> 01:04:32,269
Come on, Logan Blade,
Street Hunter, hunt this.

1014
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:34,972
Come on, let's go.

1015
01:04:38,943 --> 01:04:40,978
Come on, I got you
doing it right here.

1016
01:04:42,246 --> 01:04:43,247
Come on.

1017
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:48,252
(BEEPING)

1018
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:21,952
Ahh!

1019
01:05:22,552 --> 01:05:23,954
RILEY: Goddamn you!

1020
01:05:25,022 --> 01:05:25,956
Get in here.

1021
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:36,566
Goddamn, Blade,
I should've killed you
a long time ago.

1022
01:05:44,574 --> 01:05:45,976
(GROANS)

1023
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,612
You talk too much.

1024
01:05:56,053 --> 01:05:58,122
LOGAN: Denise.

1025
01:05:58,155 --> 01:05:59,556
It's okay now, baby.

1026
01:06:02,226 --> 01:06:03,393
Stay, Munch.

1027
01:06:12,436 --> 01:06:15,005
Yes, Mr. Blade.
It's okay now.

1028
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:17,041
I've got her.

1029
01:06:18,375 --> 01:06:20,344
Congratulations,
you're a worthy adversary.

1030
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:23,013
I appreciate that.

1031
01:06:23,047 --> 01:06:24,448
I wanted to meet you.

1032
01:06:25,049 --> 01:06:26,183
But now...

1033
01:06:27,151 --> 01:06:28,152
Now the hunt's over.

1034
01:06:29,186 --> 01:06:30,054
WALSH: Shoot the mutt.

1035
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,461
Sorry, jefe.

1036
01:06:41,365 --> 01:06:43,233
Remember, men,

1037
01:06:43,267 --> 01:06:44,768
in the field,
you can't afford to miss.

1038
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:48,638
Here we are, Logan, huh?

1039
01:06:48,672 --> 01:06:50,774
It's you, me,
my boys, your girl.

1040
01:06:50,807 --> 01:06:52,742
We're all here, man, come on.

1041
01:06:52,776 --> 01:06:54,544
Why don't you just take me?

1042
01:06:54,578 --> 01:06:55,745
Come on, man, take me.

1043
01:06:55,779 --> 01:06:57,347
Come on, why don't you
fucking take me, right?

1044
01:06:57,381 --> 01:06:59,483
You've been chasing me
for a whole fucking month!

1045
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:01,085
Come on, what is it?

1046
01:07:01,118 --> 01:07:02,619
'Cause you're not
with your dog, man,
is that it?

1047
01:07:02,652 --> 01:07:04,088
You're not with your dog?
Or you're afraid we're gonna

1048
01:07:04,121 --> 01:07:05,555
hurt your girl?
Is that what it is?

1049
01:07:05,589 --> 01:07:07,157
We're not gonna
hurt her, man.

1050
01:07:07,191 --> 01:07:08,358
We're gonna be
nice and gentle with her.

1051
01:07:08,392 --> 01:07:09,593

so you coming or what?

(LAUGHS)

1055
01:07:16,633 --> 01:07:18,602
Come on, man,
you're coming or what?

(SIGHS)

1058
01:07:27,211 --> 01:07:28,645
Denise. Honey?

1059
01:07:32,649 --> 01:07:34,151
Walsh...

1060
01:07:34,751 --> 01:07:36,052
Let her go.

1061
01:07:42,126 --> 01:07:43,660
Your concern for this woman
surprises me, buddy.

1062
01:07:45,362 --> 01:07:49,499
She's been your downfall.
Achilles heel.

1063
01:07:49,533 --> 01:07:53,103
Perhaps you've forgotten
you're a soldier,
a warrior like me.

1064
01:07:53,137 --> 01:07:55,205
Oh, man, I'm nothing like you.

1065
01:07:55,239 --> 01:07:57,541
You're wrong. We're brothers.

1066
01:07:57,574 --> 01:08:00,610
-The difference is you have
no respect for law and order.
-You're wrong again.

1067
01:08:00,644 --> 01:08:03,113
I respect the law.

1068
01:08:03,147 --> 01:08:05,715
The law I create,
administer and judge.

1069
01:08:05,749 --> 01:08:09,153
It's the only way, Blade.
Order doesn't work.

1070
01:08:09,186 --> 01:08:11,121
That's why I created
my own here,

1071
01:08:11,155 --> 01:08:13,657
because order
is only as good
as those who control it.

1072
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:14,558
Look what happened in 'Nam.

1073
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:16,526
No, man, don't start that,
I was there.

1074
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:17,894
I know.

1075
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:20,297
I did my homework.

1076
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:22,732
You know they didn't
let us win.

1077
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:25,169
I also think there was
a little bit more to it
than that.

1078
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:27,537
No, man.

1079
01:08:28,405 --> 01:08:30,540
They fucked it up.

1080
01:08:30,574 --> 01:08:32,142
They didn't let us win.

1081
01:08:33,377 --> 01:08:36,380
Glory was denied us.

1082
01:08:37,581 --> 01:08:39,149
And now,

1083
01:08:39,816 --> 01:08:41,551
now there's no more wars.

1084
01:08:42,686 --> 01:08:44,421
Nothing to fight for anymore.

1085
01:08:45,422 --> 01:08:47,657
You know that, Blade.

1086
01:08:47,691 --> 01:08:50,160
There's nothing to fight for
but the fight itself.

1087
01:08:53,763 --> 01:08:55,932
Only in war can you
find your soul.

1088
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:57,601
Walsh.

1089
01:08:57,634 --> 01:09:01,305
Is that what all this
is about for you? Hmm?

1090
01:09:01,338 --> 01:09:03,240
It's about the consequences
of strength.

1091
01:09:04,574 --> 01:09:06,142
I am strong.

1092
01:09:07,211 --> 01:09:08,945
Yo, man, you, uh,

1093
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:12,182
may be strong with those
two goons behind you,
and, uh,

1094
01:09:12,216 --> 01:09:14,618
may be strong
with a fistful of lead
in your hands.

1095
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:16,353
How strong would you be
one-on-one?

1096
01:09:17,221 --> 01:09:19,356
Mano-a-mano, huh?

1097
01:09:19,389 --> 01:09:22,158
Mano-a-mano, 
 you know what I mean?

1098
01:09:23,227 --> 01:09:25,329
Tempting challenge, buddy.

1099
01:09:25,362 --> 01:09:27,331
And one I'll take you up
on our next briefing.

1100
01:09:27,364 --> 01:09:29,333
Perhaps after we
explore that challenge,

1101
01:09:29,366 --> 01:09:31,601
you'll want to join with me.

1102
01:09:31,635 --> 01:09:36,240
Perhaps I can change
your mind about
the state of things.

1103
01:09:36,273 --> 01:09:38,342
I might take you up
on that preposition.

1104
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:41,578
If, uh, you just let Denise
go free, okay?

1105
01:09:41,611 --> 01:09:43,613
-Huh?
-(LAUGHS)

1106
01:09:46,783 --> 01:09:49,219
I need more of a commitment
than your word to let her go.

1107
01:09:51,255 --> 01:09:52,789
This woman means
nothing to me.

1108
01:09:53,623 --> 01:09:54,958
Angel wants her.

1109
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:59,529
If he does his job
in tonight's operation,

1110
01:09:59,563 --> 01:10:01,798
I'll give her to him.
The spoils of war.

1111
01:10:03,367 --> 01:10:04,434
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

1112
01:10:04,834 --> 01:10:06,736
Come in.

1113
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:09,205
All set, jefe. 
I did everything
that you said.

1114
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,375
Good job, Angel.

1115
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:15,779
I've enjoyed talking
with you, Blade.

1116
01:10:17,314 --> 01:10:18,615
So I won't kill you.

1117
01:10:18,648 --> 01:10:20,284
You're not gonna
waste him now?

1118
01:10:20,317 --> 01:10:21,318
Oh, man,
I'll take care of him.

1119
01:10:21,351 --> 01:10:23,320
-I'll take care of him
in a heartbeat.
-No.

1120
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:27,291
I want him alive.

1121
01:10:27,324 --> 01:10:29,626
He's the only one here
who knows what the hell
I'm talking about.

1122
01:10:38,935 --> 01:10:40,937
I should finish you off
right now, fucking Logan.

1123
01:10:43,407 --> 01:10:45,041
You want to finish me off?

1124
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:47,043
Go ahead.
Finish me off.

1125
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:49,413

you funny-looking
little midget,

1126

your fruitcake leader
over there will slice
your throat from ear to ear.

1127
01:10:52,015 --> 01:10:54,984
He said that shit?

1128
01:10:55,018 --> 01:10:57,587
That's all right,
'cause I'm not going
to need him after tonight.

1129
01:10:57,621 --> 01:11:00,790
'Cause I'm sick and fucking
tired of him talking
about the fucking past.

01:11:00,824 --> 01:11:02,326
'Cause I don't care
about the past, man,

and tomorrow, man.

01:25:11,274 --> 01:25:13,142
Last chance, Blade!

1357
01:25:35,698 --> 01:25:37,166
(GUN CLICKS)

1358
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:46,242
I'm still here, Blade.

1359
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,329
Let's end it, Walsh.

1360
01:26:06,362 --> 01:26:08,163
We should've been
friends, Blade.

1361
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:11,166
WALSH: I'm gonna miss you.

1362
01:26:13,369 --> 01:26:14,637
(CLICKS)

1363
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:15,938
Ahhh!

1364
01:26:15,971 --> 01:26:17,240
(CRASHING)

1365
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:18,974
(THUDS)

1366
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:21,344
Can't say the same about you.

1367
01:26:47,836 --> 01:26:49,272
(DOG GROWLING)

1368
01:26:51,974 --> 01:26:53,576
(SNARLING)

1369
01:26:57,646 --> 01:26:59,282
Ahh!

1370
01:26:59,315 --> 01:27:01,417
ANGEL: (COUGHS)
My nose, man.

1371
01:27:01,450 --> 01:27:02,985
You broke my nose.

1372
01:27:03,018 --> 01:27:05,888
Good. That way you won't put
anymore nose candy up there.

1373
01:27:05,921 --> 01:27:07,790
Hey, I used to be
so good-looking, man,

1374
01:27:07,823 --> 01:27:09,292
and you had to bust my nose.

1375
01:27:09,325 --> 01:27:12,295
Look, I'm tired,
my lady is very pissed at me,

1376
01:27:12,328 --> 01:27:13,996
it's because I've been chasing
your skinny little ass.

1377
01:27:14,029 --> 01:27:16,499
I don't care, man.
You busted my nose.

1378
01:27:16,532 --> 01:27:17,800
(BONE CRUNCHING)
(GROANS)

1379
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:19,902
Now it's fixed.

1380
01:27:19,935 --> 01:27:22,905
-It's cold-blooded, man.
-Yeah.

1381
01:27:22,938 --> 01:27:25,374
You might as well kill me,
man, 'cause I'm not
gonna go back.

1382
01:27:25,408 --> 01:27:27,610
Oh, no, no.
That's too easy.

1383
01:27:27,643 --> 01:27:31,447
Besides, I'd rather see you
get put away for life
without parole.

1384
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:34,016
So that way,
you can rot till you die.

1385
01:27:34,049 --> 01:27:35,351
(CHUCKLES)

1386
01:27:35,918 --> 01:27:37,252
Get in there.

1387
01:27:38,954 --> 01:27:40,356
(SIGHS) Good boy.

1388
01:27:44,427 --> 01:27:46,395
You know,
you skinny little monkey,

1389
01:27:46,429 --> 01:27:49,665
the more people I meet,
the more I like my dog.

1390
01:27:52,468 --> 01:27:55,704
I'll get you, man.
I'm gonna kill you, Logan.
I'm gonna...

1391
01:27:55,738 --> 01:27:58,341
Shut up.
Let's go, Munch.
