Did it all happen so fast?

29
00:02:35,092 --> 00:02:37,675
How did my life become my life?

30
00:02:41,306 --> 00:02:45,453
I was living in a quiet
place at a quiet time

31
00:02:45,503 --> 00:02:48,173
when out of the blue, heaven

32
00:02:48,223 --> 00:02:52,223
and hell seemed to fall
upon me with such force.

33
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:55,681
That I was swept away on a tide of events.

34
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:02,846

35
00:03:07,838 --> 00:03:09,677
- So I'm not Pavarotti.

36
00:03:09,727 --> 00:03:11,059
Hey, look, Rudyard Kipling.

37
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:14,579
There is an example of a poet warrior.

38
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:16,796
- Hans Christian Anderson.

39
00:03:18,026 --> 00:03:21,657
- Hans Christian Anderson?
He wrote fairytales.

40
00:03:21,707 --> 00:03:24,136
- You are so easy to tease.

41
00:03:24,186 --> 00:03:27,037
- Oh, you're flirting
with me again, aren't you?

42
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:29,997
Senselessly flirting. You
are right, though, you know.

43
00:03:30,047 --> 00:03:32,714
A man can be warrior and a poet.

44
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,976
He can be strong.

45
00:03:36,026 --> 00:03:37,539
Yet sensitive at heart.

46
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:39,936
Take me for example.

47
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,903
- Mario, you are lovable.
- Lovable?

48
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,893
What does that mean? I'm
a wuss, a wimp, a weenie?

49
00:03:47,943 --> 00:03:50,019
- You know how I feel about you.

50
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:52,136
- Yeah. Like a friend.

51
00:03:52,186 --> 00:03:53,960
You know, one day you will realize

52
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,280
how you really feel about me.

53
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,416
I'm the one who will always be here

54
00:03:57,466 --> 00:04:00,936
when all those so-called poet
warriors have come and gone.

55
00:04:00,986 --> 00:04:03,539
- So what, are you going to propose again?

56
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:06,600
- Oh, speak again bright
angel for thou art as glorious

57
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,372
in my head as a winged
messenger of heaven.

58
00:04:10,422 --> 00:04:13,160
Say yes and get it over with.

59
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,536
- Get it over with.

60
00:04:14,586 --> 00:04:17,656
Oh, so that's how you see commitment

61
00:04:17,706 --> 00:04:20,200
and spending the rest of
your life with someone?

62
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,000
Getting it over with.

- Just a minute.
- Miss Antasio?

73
00:04:49,684 --> 00:04:53,017
- Oh, Mr. Kirkman, I'm so glad you came.

74
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,217
Thank you.

75
00:04:57,267 --> 00:05:00,637
Now see. I told you how bad it was.

76
00:05:00,687 --> 00:05:03,104
And I called him three times.

77
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:07,874
And no one has come.

78
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,042
- And that's it?

79
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:14,494
You call three times and
you and your neighbors

80
00:05:14,544 --> 00:05:16,954
just continue to let this sewer grow?

81
00:05:17,004 --> 00:05:18,541
- But he's a slumlord.

82
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:21,289
I mean, look at this
place. It is his fault.

83
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:23,416
- No, Miss Antasio.

84
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:26,499
Rigdon didn't haul this
trash in here to fester.

85
00:05:26,549 --> 00:05:29,080
You and your neighbors
did that to yourselves.

86
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,357
You're as much the problem as he is.

87
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:33,080
- What are we supposed to do?

88
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,019
- Clean the trash and filth
from your halls, Miss Antasio.

89
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:40,397
Then you call me. I'll make
damn sure Rigdon does his part.

90
00:05:40,447 --> 00:05:42,177
But don't call me when
you're the co-creators

91
00:05:42,227 --> 00:05:44,499
of your own horrible living conditions.

92
00:05:44,549 --> 00:05:47,439
Please, Miss Antasio, get
this place cleaned up.

93
00:05:47,489 --> 00:05:50,003
I'll take care of Rigdon.

94
00:05:50,053 --> 00:05:52,220
Okay? Okay, Miss Antasio?

95
00:05:55,413 --> 00:05:56,461
- Okay.

96
00:05:56,511 --> 00:05:58,339
- Thank you.
- Okay.

97
00:05:58,389 --> 00:05:59,639
- Today.
- Okay.

98
00:06:02,346 --> 00:06:04,899
- Ladies and gentlemen, let's get started.

99
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:07,616
(stately music)

100
00:06:09,813 --> 00:06:12,760
We don't care about third
world government policy.

101
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,280
We make policy.

102
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,997
We, money, capitalism, make
the only policy that counts.

103
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:22,779
Now, Rita.
- Yes, sir?

104
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:25,619
I want you to take the corporate jet

105
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:30,169
and a suitcase full of cash
and fly down to San Duarte

106
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,778
and tell Colonel Delgado
to have a nice vacation

107
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,161
in The Bahamas.

108
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:41,379
Something on your mind?

109
00:06:41,429 --> 00:06:43,240
- I have my concerns, sir.

110
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,723
- Well, let me hear them.

111
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:47,160
- You know, Agricultural
Department Secretary Battis

112
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,981
recently met with all the union
leaders from South America

113
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:51,539
on his trip.

114
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:54,259
- And this concerns you.
- Yes, sir, it does.

115
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:55,683
- It's your job to stop errand boys

116
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:58,243
from getting in the way of commerce.

117
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,523
- Do I do what I have to do

118
00:06:59,573 --> 00:07:02,541
in order to keep them from
asking any more questions?

119
00:07:02,591 --> 00:07:04,003
(somber music)

120
00:07:04,053 --> 00:07:06,899
Are there any particular rules, sir?

121
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:07,949
- Yes. Mine.

122
00:07:14,247 --> 00:07:15,614
- [Linda] Hey MW.

123
00:07:15,664 --> 00:07:17,101
I've got it. Yes, I've got it.

124
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:21,318
I'm going to nail his slimey
butt to a stone cross.

125
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,592
- [Man] Sharon, this is your boss.

126
00:07:27,642 --> 00:07:29,770
I'm on my way to meet Linda
at the Sheraton in San Pedro.

127
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,320
Forward all my messages there.

128
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:39,507
- Okay. Thank you.

129
00:07:39,557 --> 00:07:41,853
- Good morning.
- Hi. How are you?

130
00:07:41,903 --> 00:07:42,736
Thank you.

131
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,613
Hey, Mr. Newspaper man. You
looking for a hot story?

132
00:07:49,663 --> 00:07:52,311
- Oh my goodness. Linda.

133
00:07:52,361 --> 00:07:54,232
- You are still the best
looking man I never seduced.

134
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:55,869
- What are you doing here?

135
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,511
- Oh.

136
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:01,853
Just a little vacation time
that I thoroughly deserved.

137
00:08:01,903 --> 00:08:05,032
- Linda, this is Joe you're
talking to, okay, come on.

138
00:08:05,082 --> 00:08:06,549
You're the one who told me,

139
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,333
LA is the only place in the world

140
00:08:08,383 --> 00:08:10,669
where you can have a good time
without enjoying yourself.

141
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:12,901
- Did I say that?
- Yes, you did.

142
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,250
It's a story, right? Something big.

143
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,469
- And I'm not telling you
a damn thing about it.

144
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,530
- That's okay. That's fine.

145
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,810
This is my place now. I
just want to know one thing?

146
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,809
- What?

147
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:25,389
- Why ain't you ever seduced me?

148
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:30,439
- Because you were a pup back
then and I like wolfhounds.

149
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,410
Besides, I was too busy making you

150
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,210
the second best investigative
reporter on this planet.

151
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,072
- And that you did.
- Yes, I did.

152
00:08:38,122 --> 00:08:41,151
Mmm, thank you. I did a good job. (kisses)

153
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:43,090
So you're taking me out to lunch?

154
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,305
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

155
00:08:44,355 --> 00:08:45,890
- I need an hour. Can you give me an hour?

156
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,309
- Yeah, I can give you an hour, where?

157
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,308
- Lighthouse.
- You can afford it now?

158
00:08:49,358 --> 00:08:53,358
- The Lighthouse, one hour.
- In an hour. See ya.

159
00:09:08,112 --> 00:09:09,779
- Mel Rigdon, please.

160
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,909
- Joe Kirkman from the Washington Post

161
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,386
to the New Times just to
harass property owners.

162
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:25,389
- Is that what you call yourself,
Rigdon, a property owner?

163
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,948
You're nothing but a loud
noise, but I'ma prove to you

164
00:09:27,998 --> 00:09:29,618
I'm even louder and starting today,

165
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:32,210
I'ma urinate on your
already tarnished image

166
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,785
in every issue until you bring every one

167
00:09:33,835 --> 00:09:35,277
of your raggedy buildings up to code.

168
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:36,608
And if you think I'm playing

169
00:09:36,658 --> 00:09:38,366
by the time I'm through
typesetting your ass,

170
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:41,805
you won't be able to breathe in this town.

171
00:09:41,855 --> 00:09:43,795
I'm warning you, Rigdon.

172
00:09:43,845 --> 00:09:46,686
(sinister music)

173
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:48,566
- Why didn't you tell me he was out here?

174
00:09:48,616 --> 00:09:50,141
That guy's trouble for us.

175
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:52,941
(sinister music)

176
00:09:57,507 --> 00:09:58,340
- Linda.

177
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,196
(Linda laughs nervously)

178
00:10:03,246 --> 00:10:05,079
Okay. What's going on?

179
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,137
- Joe, if you hear from me?

180
00:10:09,187 --> 00:10:11,770
(smooth music)

181
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:14,236
- I get it.

182
00:10:14,286 --> 00:10:17,335
You come around my office,
acting all mysterious

183
00:10:17,385 --> 00:10:19,135
as only Linda can do.

184
00:10:20,185 --> 00:10:22,679
What exactly are you and that
old charm school reptile Marty

185
00:10:22,729 --> 00:10:24,055
up to this time?

186
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:27,537
- Just forget I said
anything. Just forget it.

187
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:30,017
Come on. Let's talk
about the good old days.

188
00:10:30,067 --> 00:10:31,319
- That's what I thought we came here for.

189
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:32,152
- Yeah, yeah.

190
00:10:32,202 --> 00:10:35,916
You remember that time we
stuck it to Sir Anthony Mallon.

191
00:10:35,966 --> 00:10:37,297
Ooh, darling.

192
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:38,737
(Joe laughs)

193
00:10:38,787 --> 00:10:39,855
- How could I forget?

194
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,439
- There I was in my very short skirt

195
00:10:42,489 --> 00:10:45,980
so that old sleazeball
could get a real good look.

196
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,396
Excuse me, the conversation is up here.

197
00:10:48,446 --> 00:10:49,857
- But your legs are down there.

198
00:10:49,907 --> 00:10:52,177
- You keep on looking down
there, your eyes'll go blind.

199
00:10:52,227 --> 00:10:53,479
- I'll lose one eye.

200
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:55,457
(Linda laughs)

201
00:10:55,507 --> 00:10:57,937
- Hey, you remember how
mad Marty introduced us

202
00:10:57,987 --> 00:10:59,100
to that thief?

203
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,860
What was his name is?

204
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,034
- Robert Adam Chickle.
- Chicklets, that's it.

205
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:07,084
Chicklets, Robert Adam Chickle, ma'am.

206
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:12,737
You remember how Ward flew him to London

207
00:11:12,787 --> 00:11:16,287
and you and I wined and dined Sir Anthony?

208
00:11:17,187 --> 00:11:21,740
Chickle broke into his house
and stole his crown jewels.

209
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,500
- Everything.
- Yes, baby,

210
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,337
which gave us all the
proof we needed to prove.

211
00:11:26,387 --> 00:11:30,097
- That Sir Anthony, Deputy
British Minister of Defense.

212
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,343
- Yes.
- And also pillar

213
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:35,063
of English society was actually spying

214
00:11:35,113 --> 00:11:37,396
for Saddam Hussein during the Gulf War.

215
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,135
- Oh, was that good or what?

216
00:11:40,185 --> 00:11:43,361
- Absolutely.
- Oh, we were a great team.

217
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,578
Yes, the best.

218
00:11:46,553 --> 00:11:47,879
You were the best.

219
00:11:47,929 --> 00:11:49,879
- No, you brought the best out of me.

220
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:52,179
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

221
00:11:54,986 --> 00:11:56,736
Wanna know something?

222
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:03,069
If I had been just 10 months
younger then, just 10 now,

223
00:12:03,191 --> 00:12:04,941
I'd have seduced you.

224
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,477
- You wanna know something?
- What?

225
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,557
- You coulda been 10 months
older and still seduced me.

226
00:12:10,607 --> 00:12:13,190
(Linda laughs)

227
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:17,796
- Mmm, I love you.
- I love you.

228
00:12:20,313 --> 00:12:23,563
- You happy here? I mean, really happy?

229
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,423
- Yeah.

230
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:30,959
This is my home, Linda.
This community needs me.

231
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:32,652
I belong here.

232
00:12:32,702 --> 00:12:34,103
(gentle music)

233
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:34,936
- You're right.

234
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:37,736
(sinister music)

235
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,384
- Who is he?
- We'll find out.

236
00:12:42,472 --> 00:12:46,663
- You think he's in it?
- It doesn't matter.

237
00:12:46,713 --> 00:12:50,046
He wants it cleaned, we'll clean it all.

238
00:12:53,609 --> 00:12:55,500
- Oh, you're up early.

239
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:58,839
- I got to hand in this
dissertation outline this afternoon.

240
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:00,765
- You were restless last night.

241
00:13:00,815 --> 00:13:02,599
- How would you know that?

242
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,561
- Because I checked on you when I came in

243
00:13:04,611 --> 00:13:08,444
and I stole your purple
sweater to wear today.

244
00:13:09,907 --> 00:13:11,196
'Cause I knew if I'd asked you today,

245
00:13:11,246 --> 00:13:14,561
you'd be too grouchy to lend it to me.

246
00:13:14,611 --> 00:13:15,921
(woman growls)

247
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:19,137
So how's that bookstore Romeo of yours?

248
00:13:19,187 --> 00:13:20,679
- He proposed again.

249
00:13:20,729 --> 00:13:24,477
- He proposed again. Oh
my God, I am shocked.

250
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:28,321
I'm so confused. I'm absolutely flummoxed.

251
00:13:28,371 --> 00:13:30,860
Have you ever been flummoxed?

252
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,897
God, is that fun.

253
00:13:32,947 --> 00:13:37,197
Especially if the flummoxer
is absolutely gorgeous.

254
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,801
- Hey girl.

255
00:13:44,851 --> 00:13:46,218
- Hey Sondra. How are you?

256
00:13:46,268 --> 00:13:48,435
- Good, how are you doing?

257
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,996
- So are you still
looking for Mr. Right, eh?

258
00:13:52,046 --> 00:13:53,046
- That's me.

259
00:13:54,046 --> 00:13:56,657
I know my Knight in shining
armor is out there somewhere.

260
00:13:56,707 --> 00:13:58,919
Maybe a little chipped, a little rusted

261
00:13:58,969 --> 00:14:03,697
but he's out there, unconditional
love or no love at all.

262
00:14:03,747 --> 00:14:06,664
- Yeah. I know what you mean, girl.

263
00:14:10,969 --> 00:14:11,802
Hi.

264
00:14:13,263 --> 00:14:14,461
- How you doing?

265
00:14:14,511 --> 00:14:17,115
(romantic music)

266
00:14:17,165 --> 00:14:19,676
I happened to overhear you
guys' conversation, and,

267
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,191
you know, you really don't want much.

268
00:14:21,241 --> 00:14:23,875
- (laughs) Well, I want it all.

269
00:14:23,925 --> 00:14:26,435
- How about we start with dinner tonight?

270
00:14:26,485 --> 00:14:28,068
Rex, eight o'clock.

271
00:14:29,722 --> 00:14:33,494
- See you later, Sondra. Bye, Sondra.

272
00:14:33,544 --> 00:14:34,877
- Okay, but go.

273
00:14:38,287 --> 00:14:41,015
- Excuse me. Everything okay here?

274
00:14:41,065 --> 00:14:42,732
- Yeah, yeah.
- Good.

275
00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:48,663
- You know, I could be married
or engaged or something.

276
00:14:48,713 --> 00:14:53,159
- No, not married or
engaged. Something maybe.

277
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:56,460
- And you don't care.
- No, I don't.

278
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,401
So you'll be there?

279
00:14:58,451 --> 00:15:00,581
- Well, that's kind of fast.

280
00:15:00,631 --> 00:15:04,401
I mean, who are you anyway?
- Joe, Joe Kirkman.

281
00:15:04,451 --> 00:15:05,618
- Joe Kirkman.

282
00:15:06,553 --> 00:15:10,039
Is that name supposed
to mean something to me?

283
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:11,453
Do you read that?

284
00:15:11,503 --> 00:15:14,817
(romantic music)

285
00:15:14,867 --> 00:15:17,784
- You're that Joe Kirkman? Oh yeah.

286
00:15:19,731 --> 00:15:21,041
Yeah. I read that.

287
00:15:21,091 --> 00:15:24,321
I like your work. It's very committed.

288
00:15:24,371 --> 00:15:25,977
- Some people say I should be committed.

289
00:15:26,027 --> 00:15:27,041
(Patrice laughs)

290
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:30,423
- Depends on your point
of view and you are?

291
00:15:30,473 --> 00:15:33,140
- Patrice Summers.
- I like that.

292
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:37,674
- So Rex at eight, did you say?

293
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:41,818
- That's right. You'll be there.

294
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,200
- And if I'm not?

295
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:48,108
- I'll have to come back and get you.

296
00:15:48,158 --> 00:15:49,804
Eight o'clock.

297
00:15:49,854 --> 00:15:52,705
- Here's your change.
- Bring it to me tonight.

298
00:15:52,755 --> 00:15:55,505
(romantic music)

299
00:15:59,976 --> 00:16:01,105
- You okay?
- Yeah.

300
00:16:01,155 --> 00:16:03,404
- Need to take a cold shower or something?

301
00:16:03,454 --> 00:16:05,687
Why do you do that in front of me?

302
00:16:05,737 --> 00:16:07,068
- Mario, my life is my own.

303
00:16:07,118 --> 00:16:10,247
- You know how I feel about you.

304
00:16:10,297 --> 00:16:12,167
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

305
00:16:12,217 --> 00:16:14,865
- Do we have to do this every day, Mario?

306
00:16:14,915 --> 00:16:18,522
- He's a love him and leave
him type if I ever saw one.

307
00:16:18,572 --> 00:16:20,764
Yo, honey, I got to go off to war now

308
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,887
so I can make the whole world better.

309
00:16:22,937 --> 00:16:25,468
You know what I mean?

310
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,564
A real man is the one who stays at home

311
00:16:27,614 --> 00:16:30,007
and deals with whatever
it has to be dealt with.

312
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:32,727
With all the little things in your life.

313
00:16:32,777 --> 00:16:37,144
Like your, your dreams,
your disappointments.

314
00:16:37,194 --> 00:16:38,882
He's not the type.

315
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:41,849
- Cut it out. And I mean it.
- Okay.

316
00:16:47,395 --> 00:16:50,228
- Mmm, mmm, mmm, Joe Kirkman, huh?

317
00:16:51,374 --> 00:16:52,541
- Joe Kirkman.

318
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:55,542
- Ooh, I got a friend over at the Weekly

319
00:16:55,592 --> 00:16:58,821
and she's telling me he is very tasty.

320
00:16:58,871 --> 00:16:59,901
- In a word.

321
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:02,451
- Ooh, sparks?
- Roman candles.

322
00:17:03,673 --> 00:17:07,361
- Look at you, finally
maybe your warrior poet.

323
00:17:07,411 --> 00:17:09,324
Because Mario certainly isn't.

324
00:17:09,374 --> 00:17:11,803
- Mario is a very decent kind man.

325
00:17:11,853 --> 00:17:13,804
- But.
- Hush just.

326
00:17:13,854 --> 00:17:15,882
- Okay, all right, all right.

327
00:17:15,932 --> 00:17:17,515
Enjoy, get unlucky.

328
00:17:21,294 --> 00:17:26,294
- I have something that
belongs to you. Your change.

329
00:17:26,414 --> 00:17:31,414
(Joe laughs)
(romantic music)

330
00:17:31,693 --> 00:17:33,564
- Mmm. Had to find a way to get you here.

331
00:17:33,614 --> 00:17:38,614
(Patrice laughs)
(romantic music)

332
00:17:40,691 --> 00:17:43,774
- So that book by Dumas that you got,

333
00:17:44,771 --> 00:17:46,924
it's not exactly a bestseller.

334
00:17:46,974 --> 00:17:48,743
- I figured that.

335
00:17:48,793 --> 00:17:50,700
That's why I called ahead
to make sure you had a copy.

336
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,164
- Hmm so you know about Dumas?

337
00:17:53,214 --> 00:17:54,721
- That he was black.

338
00:17:54,771 --> 00:17:58,481
That his father was a general
in Napoleon's army. Of course.

339
00:17:58,531 --> 00:18:00,524
- Okay. I'm embarrassed.

340
00:18:00,574 --> 00:18:02,738
- Not much faith in black men, right?

341
00:18:02,788 --> 00:18:06,205
- No, not much faith in men of any color.

342
00:18:09,531 --> 00:18:11,259
- (laughs) Now is that going
to be tonight's subject?

343
00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:14,476
- (laughs) No.
- Okay.

344
00:18:16,371 --> 00:18:18,218
I notice your necklace
there. It's very beautiful.

345
00:18:18,268 --> 00:18:22,940
- It's my mother's wedding
ring. My father's wedding ring.

346
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:23,943
They were killed in a car crash

347
00:18:23,993 --> 00:18:26,137
when I was a freshman in college.

348
00:18:26,187 --> 00:18:28,801
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

349
00:18:28,851 --> 00:18:32,184
I lost my mom to cancer a few years ago.

350
00:18:33,786 --> 00:18:35,479
- So tell me about your
journalistic career.

351
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:36,700
How did you get started?

352
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,441
- At St. Alban's Review
in Queens, New York.

353
00:18:39,491 --> 00:18:42,191
Actually, I was only 14 years old.

354
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:44,615
Reporting on the quality
of lemonade stands

355
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,201
around the neighborhood.

356
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,575
- Were you an impartial critic?

357
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,958
- I couldn't be, my sisters had a stand.

358
00:18:55,449 --> 00:18:56,876
Would you like something to drink?

359
00:18:56,926 --> 00:18:59,100
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Waiter?

360
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,776
So eventually I decided to leave the Post

361
00:19:01,826 --> 00:19:03,436
because I realized the stories
that matter the most to me

362
00:19:03,486 --> 00:19:05,432
were the ones right here
in my own community.

363
00:19:05,482 --> 00:19:08,695
- [Patrice] Oh yeah, I understand that.

364
00:19:08,745 --> 00:19:12,097
- [Joe] Well, little lady,
you've got your hands full.

365
00:19:12,147 --> 00:19:13,857
You're about to get
your doctorate candidacy

366
00:19:13,907 --> 00:19:16,655
on the future of democracy
in central American politics.

367
00:19:16,705 --> 00:19:20,193
And you happen to be a super
whiz kid at computer science?

368
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:23,495
(laughs) That's a bit much for one woman.

369
00:19:23,545 --> 00:19:25,393
I never told you I barely
got through journalism school

370
00:19:25,443 --> 00:19:27,433
with a C average, did I?

371
00:19:27,483 --> 00:19:30,657
- [Patrice] Well, we
can't all be brilliant.

372
00:19:30,707 --> 00:19:32,874
- [Joe] Or humble. My God.

373
00:19:34,345 --> 00:19:37,375
- Thanks for the ride.
- It's my pleasure.

374
00:19:37,425 --> 00:19:38,375
You sure your roommate's
not gonna be worried

375
00:19:38,425 --> 00:19:39,415
about you, though?

376
00:19:39,465 --> 00:19:40,433
- [Patrice] No, I told
her I'd give her a call

377
00:19:40,483 --> 00:19:41,953
if I needed a ride.

378
00:19:42,003 --> 00:19:43,537
- [Joe] Oh, let me get the door for you.

379
00:19:43,587 --> 00:19:44,837
- Yeah, thanks.

380
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,726
Thank you.
- You tell her

381
00:19:57,305 --> 00:20:00,253
Whenever you go out with Joe
Kirkman, you never need a ride.

382
00:20:00,303 --> 00:20:01,900
Okay?
- I will do that.

383
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,867
- Make sure you do. You understand?

384
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,239
I had a great time.
- So did I.

385
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:13,301
- I'll see you.

386
00:20:13,351 --> 00:20:16,101
(romantic music)

387
00:20:24,334 --> 00:20:25,564
- Good night.
- Goodnight.

388
00:20:25,614 --> 00:20:27,244
- See you tomorrow?

389
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:28,820
- Okay, yeah.
- I'll call you.

390
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,398
- Okay, night.
- You take care.

391
00:20:31,448 --> 00:20:34,198
(romantic music)

392
00:20:39,497 --> 00:20:40,330
- Bye.

393
00:20:45,017 --> 00:20:45,800
- Yes!

394
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,600
(romantic music)

395
00:21:04,675 --> 00:21:05,835
- Bang zoom?
- Bang zoom. Yes!

396
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:11,147
- Really? I don't believe it.

397
00:21:13,198 --> 00:21:16,406
Do you realize that Mario's gonna know?

398
00:21:16,456 --> 00:21:19,388
Tomorrow when he sees
you, he's going to know.

399
00:21:19,438 --> 00:21:20,828
- Mario already knows.

400
00:21:20,878 --> 00:21:22,795
- Oh, ouch, poor Mario.

401
00:21:23,758 --> 00:21:27,628
Ever the romantic dreamer
where you were concerned.

402
00:21:27,678 --> 00:21:31,290
So what about Mr. K? Okay,
does he know? (laughs)

403
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,401
Yes, of course he knows.

404
00:21:33,451 --> 00:21:34,868
Gosh, I envy you.

405
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,676
Do you realize that your next sex

406
00:21:37,726 --> 00:21:40,643
is just going to record shattering?

407
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:44,126
- He's the one, Carolyn.

408
00:21:44,985 --> 00:21:48,695
All that frustration, all that waiting.

409
00:21:48,745 --> 00:21:52,995
And it's him. I knew it
the moment I looked at him.

410
00:21:55,844 --> 00:21:56,796
- You realize I'm going to have

411
00:21:56,846 --> 00:21:59,778
to melt from sheer jealousy, right?

412
00:21:59,828 --> 00:22:00,993
- [Linda] Nope, no, no, no, no.

413
00:22:01,043 --> 00:22:02,274
Not on the phone.

414
00:22:02,324 --> 00:22:03,107
No. Listen, meet me under crane

415
00:22:03,157 --> 00:22:04,197
six on the San Pedro pier.

416
00:22:07,305 --> 00:22:09,276
All right. Ciao.

417
00:22:09,326 --> 00:22:12,159
(sinister music)

418
00:22:25,904 --> 00:22:28,769
(Linda screams)

419
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:31,652
(sinister music)

420
00:22:40,647 --> 00:22:43,176
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Patrice.

421
00:22:43,226 --> 00:22:44,173
- Good morning, Mario.

422
00:22:44,223 --> 00:22:46,576
- Look who decided to come in today.

423
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:48,296
Must have been a late date.

424
00:22:48,346 --> 00:22:49,179
- Mario.

425
00:22:50,823 --> 00:22:54,514
- Are you going to go out with him again?

426
00:22:54,564 --> 00:22:56,214
- Yes I am.

427
00:22:56,264 --> 00:22:57,213
(Mario sighs)

428
00:22:57,263 --> 00:23:00,935
And that's going to be the
end of this conversation.

429
00:23:00,985 --> 00:23:02,514
- Do you know how much this is hurting me?

430
00:23:02,564 --> 00:23:04,375
- You have no right to say that.

431
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:06,215
- I think three years gives me the right.

432
00:23:06,265 --> 00:23:08,348
- Do you want me to quit?

433
00:23:10,982 --> 00:23:13,309
- Just get to work.

434
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:14,815
♪ I want to know ♪

435
00:23:14,865 --> 00:23:17,557
♪ All about it ♪

436
00:23:17,607 --> 00:23:18,608
- Well, have you come to humble yourself

437
00:23:18,658 --> 00:23:20,368
for the great sacrifice
I'm making in going out

438
00:23:20,418 --> 00:23:23,595
with Philip tonight so
you can cook for and with

439
00:23:23,645 --> 00:23:25,324
your new babe-alicious?

440
00:23:25,374 --> 00:23:26,327
- Some sacrifice.

441
00:23:26,377 --> 00:23:27,946
You've been wanting to wrinkle his sheets

442
00:23:27,996 --> 00:23:29,248
ever since you met him.

443
00:23:29,298 --> 00:23:31,369
- Oh, please, they're already wrinkled.

444
00:23:31,419 --> 00:23:33,252
- You are such a slut.

445
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,048
- Look who's talking.

446
00:23:36,098 --> 00:23:38,170
At least I've known him
for more than 12 minutes.

447
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,586
- Oh, what makes you think I'm
going to sleep with Joseph?

448
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:43,328
- Well, who am I some
bumpkin from cupcake?

449
00:23:43,378 --> 00:23:47,328
- Yes. You're a Norwegian bumpkin slut.

450
00:23:47,378 --> 00:23:49,546
- You know, if you weren't my best friend,

451
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:52,250
I'd really take that personally.

452
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,048
And I bet you anything that your sheets

453
00:23:54,098 --> 00:23:56,629
will be sweaty before Phillip's.

454
00:23:56,679 --> 00:23:59,179
- Just shut up and taste this.

455
00:24:01,436 --> 00:24:04,436
(suspenseful music)

456
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:06,405
- Important men like you should be careful

457
00:24:06,455 --> 00:24:08,345
about places like this.

458
00:24:08,395 --> 00:24:12,422
- Men like me never worry about anything.

459
00:24:12,472 --> 00:24:14,485
- Took care of that little errand.

460
00:24:14,535 --> 00:24:15,868
- Nice and neat?

461
00:24:17,036 --> 00:24:18,522
- You know Ward's here.

462
00:24:18,572 --> 00:24:20,544
- Of course I do. He's an annoyance.

463
00:24:20,594 --> 00:24:22,704
Just like the woman. Watch him.

464
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:26,805
- What about that other
annoyance that showed up?

465
00:24:26,855 --> 00:24:28,725
- Let's make sure first.

466
00:24:28,775 --> 00:24:29,845
- You're the boss.

467
00:24:29,895 --> 00:24:33,066
- That's something that you
don't ever want to forget.

468
00:24:33,116 --> 00:24:35,866
(romantic music)

469
00:24:39,015 --> 00:24:40,522
- It's okay, Joe.

470
00:24:40,572 --> 00:24:43,572
I know it's okay. All right, I know.

471
00:24:45,474 --> 00:24:48,557
All right, Kirkman, Kirkman, Kirkman.

472
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:54,803
48 hours ago, you were
a confirmed bachelor.

473
00:24:54,853 --> 00:24:57,853
Now. You're like a teenager in love.

474
00:24:59,052 --> 00:25:00,303
But it's simple. It's real simple.

475
00:25:00,353 --> 00:25:02,221
Even though it's pressure.
You're feeling pressured.

476
00:25:02,271 --> 00:25:04,242
I know all that.

477
00:25:04,292 --> 00:25:06,292
I know, but it's simple.

478
00:25:07,394 --> 00:25:09,104
Either you come across
a single greatest moment

479
00:25:09,154 --> 00:25:12,885
of your life, (laughs)

480
00:25:12,935 --> 00:25:16,352
ah, or you need serious psychiatric help.

481
00:25:20,533 --> 00:25:22,700
Let's see which one it is.

482
00:25:25,676 --> 00:25:27,045
(doorbell rings)

483
00:25:27,095 --> 00:25:29,845
(romantic music)

484
00:25:47,614 --> 00:25:49,531
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

485
00:25:50,374 --> 00:25:51,904
- I'm fine. How are you?

486
00:25:51,954 --> 00:25:53,365
- Okay.

487
00:25:53,415 --> 00:25:54,415
- Oh, roses.

488
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,645
It's my favorite. Thank you.

489
00:25:59,695 --> 00:26:02,645
It's a good guess.
- Thank you.

490
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:03,528
- Karma?

491
00:26:05,495 --> 00:26:07,285
- A lot of research.

492
00:26:07,335 --> 00:26:10,085
(romantic music)

493
00:26:11,095 --> 00:26:12,986
- Mm, smells wonderful around here.

494
00:26:13,036 --> 00:26:15,184
- Let's hope it tastes that way.

495
00:26:15,234 --> 00:26:17,104
- You have any doubts?

496
00:26:17,154 --> 00:26:19,442
- Actually none.
- I didn't think so.

497
00:26:19,492 --> 00:26:22,242
(romantic music)

498
00:26:25,276 --> 00:26:27,886
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you.

499
00:26:27,936 --> 00:26:30,026
- Your place looks nice too.

500
00:26:30,076 --> 00:26:32,592
- That's very gallant of you, Joseph.

501
00:26:32,642 --> 00:26:34,787
You do like Middle Eastern food?

502
00:26:34,837 --> 00:26:36,565
- Yes. Matter of fact, I do.

503
00:26:36,615 --> 00:26:38,144
I spent some time there, you know.

504
00:26:38,194 --> 00:26:39,923
- Yeah, I know.

505
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,904
The article you did on the children

506
00:26:41,954 --> 00:26:46,537
and the post-war conditions
in Baghdad was outstanding.

507
00:26:48,615 --> 00:26:52,278
Yes. I read you when you
were at the Post too.

508
00:26:52,328 --> 00:26:54,160
All right, now see, that's not fair.

509
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,744
You been holding out on me.

510
00:26:55,794 --> 00:26:58,506
You didn't say a thing
about that last night.

511
00:26:58,556 --> 00:27:01,066
- Well, last night was last night.

512
00:27:01,116 --> 00:27:02,639
Tonight is tonight.

513
00:27:02,689 --> 00:27:05,636
(romantic music)

514
00:27:05,686 --> 00:27:10,019
A little at a time, Mr.
Kirkman, a little at a time.

515
00:27:12,475 --> 00:27:14,058
- You're beautiful.

516
00:27:14,976 --> 00:27:16,309
Extremely smart.

517
00:27:17,298 --> 00:27:18,715
And a great cook.

518
00:27:19,896 --> 00:27:21,425
I'm not leaving.

519
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:24,165
(Patrice laughs)

520
00:27:24,215 --> 00:27:26,490
So where's your roommate?

521
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,810
- She's out playing.

522
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,693
She'll either be back
very late or very early.

523
00:27:35,316 --> 00:27:37,370
So why don't we go sit on the couch?

524
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,170
(romantic music)

525
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:44,746
- So hard to quarrel with perfection.

526
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:47,589
- You know, I never pass up flattery.

527
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:48,629
- You shouldn't.

528
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:51,096
(both laugh)

529
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,213
- Listen.

530
00:27:56,023 --> 00:28:00,606
I was in Syria and Lebanon
and I just love their music.

531
00:28:03,324 --> 00:28:04,504
And their dancing.

532
00:28:04,554 --> 00:28:08,471
It's just this urgency
that the rhythm conveys.

533
00:28:10,107 --> 00:28:12,857
(romantic music)

534
00:28:37,154 --> 00:28:39,852
Come on, dance with me.
- I have two left feet.

535
00:28:39,902 --> 00:28:41,786
Don't worry, I'll teach you.

536
00:28:41,836 --> 00:28:44,586
(romantic music)

537
00:29:16,193 --> 00:29:18,501
I won't believe you if you tell me that

538
00:29:18,551 --> 00:29:21,968
what's happening is only happening to me.

539
00:29:25,495 --> 00:29:28,995
- I couldn't do that. That would be a lie.

540
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,956
- I'm not a child, Joe.

541
00:29:35,697 --> 00:29:39,197
And I'm not a fool, and I'm not desperate.

542
00:29:42,236 --> 00:29:43,486
But I love you.

543
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:47,266
There's no doubt in my mind.

544
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:51,912
- I know.

545
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:56,142
I knew it the moment I saw you.

546
00:29:57,415 --> 00:30:00,106
My soul's been searching
for yours forever.

547
00:30:00,156 --> 00:30:02,906

(downbeat music)

565
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:04,133
- [Martin] Joe, this is Martin.

566
00:32:04,183 --> 00:32:06,613
I just arrived at the
Sheraton in San Pedro.

567
00:32:06,663 --> 00:32:07,828
Give me a call when you get in.

568
00:32:07,878 --> 00:32:08,711
- Mmm.

569
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:15,665
Oh, Marty, I knew it wouldn't
be long before you showed up.

570
00:32:15,715 --> 00:32:18,671
Operator, can I have the
Sheraton in San Pedro, please.

571
00:32:18,721 --> 00:32:19,690
- I want every stone unturned.

572
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,426
I don't care whose feathers
we ruffle. You understand?

573
00:32:23,476 --> 00:32:26,212
No, you're not hearing
me. This is priority.

574
00:32:26,262 --> 00:32:27,925
You tell all our people on the coast.

575
00:32:27,975 --> 00:32:30,853
- [Man] You're right. He's
talking to his office.

576
00:32:30,903 --> 00:32:31,686
- [Martin] Now leave a
message at the hotel.

577
00:32:31,736 --> 00:32:35,147
- He thinks she left
what she knows somewhere.

578
00:32:35,197 --> 00:32:37,834
So where do we start looking.

579
00:32:37,884 --> 00:32:39,450
Ward's in the dark and
she's that thorough.

580
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,933
The only contact she made here is.

581
00:32:42,983 --> 00:32:44,511
- Let's go.

582
00:32:44,561 --> 00:32:47,561
(suspenseful music)

583
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:13,930
- Ward's prowling.

584
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:17,850
He's convinced the dead
bitch left a package.

585
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,900
- Kirkman.

586
00:33:20,358 --> 00:33:22,191
I don't like unknowns.

587
00:33:23,137 --> 00:33:24,687
Have you found a way in?

588
00:33:24,737 --> 00:33:26,320
- Yeah, I found it.

589
00:33:27,477 --> 00:33:29,845
- Get in, and get answers.

590
00:33:29,895 --> 00:33:31,525
- And if he's a player?

591
00:33:31,575 --> 00:33:34,575
- Step on his neck, step on it hard.

592
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:39,183
(suspenseful music)

593
00:34:04,138 --> 00:34:05,885
- Listen, baby, take
that gum out your mouth.

594
00:34:05,935 --> 00:34:07,627
Everybody has their water, okay?

595
00:34:07,677 --> 00:34:10,010
All right. Ooh, Joe Kirkman.

596
00:34:11,502 --> 00:34:15,634
Boy, where have you been keeping yourself?

597
00:34:15,684 --> 00:34:18,616
And who's this pretty young thing you got

598
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:22,136
holed up close to you, my goodness?

599
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:25,293
- Lanetta, this is
Patrice. And she's the one.

600
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:27,292
- Well, bless my soul, honey.

601
00:34:27,342 --> 00:34:29,874
Now when did all this come about?

602
00:34:29,924 --> 00:34:31,512
- Recently, it wouldn't matter

603
00:34:31,562 --> 00:34:34,056
if I met her outside your
door five minutes ago.

604
00:34:34,106 --> 00:34:35,272
- Oh, and don't I know it.

605
00:34:35,322 --> 00:34:37,736
Because I told you, Joe, that one day

606
00:34:37,786 --> 00:34:39,592
lightning was going to hit you smack right

607
00:34:39,642 --> 00:34:41,634
between those baby brown eyes.

608
00:34:41,684 --> 00:34:43,474
Now didn't I tell you that?
- Yes you did.

609
00:34:43,524 --> 00:34:44,788
- Didn't I?

610
00:34:44,838 --> 00:34:48,994
Ooh, child, you got yourself
a fine man here, honey.

611
00:34:49,044 --> 00:34:51,853
You better hold on to him
tight. Now you hear me?

612
00:34:51,903 --> 00:34:52,686
- Oh, don't you worry, Miss Lenetta.

613
00:34:52,736 --> 00:34:53,736
I'm holding on real tight

614
00:34:54,666 --> 00:34:58,712
- That's a girl. Oh, Joe,
I can see right away.

615
00:34:58,762 --> 00:35:02,262
She's special.
- Yes she is, one of a kind.

616
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,413
I'm supposed to be meeting
two friends of mine here,

617
00:35:06,463 --> 00:35:08,792
Martin Ward and Linda Cray,
anybody been looking for me?

618
00:35:08,842 --> 00:35:11,591
- Mmm, well, you know, there's
a down in the mouth white man

619
00:35:11,641 --> 00:35:13,490
sitting over there at
the bar all by himself.

620
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:17,112
Joe, looks like he seen a
ghost. Is that your white man?

621
00:35:17,162 --> 00:35:19,162
- That's Martin. Martin?

622
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,952
How you doing man?
- How are you?

623
00:35:25,002 --> 00:35:26,930
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

624
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,788
- All right. Patrice, this is Martin Ward.

625
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:31,794
International editor of
Washington Post, my former boss

626
00:35:31,844 --> 00:35:35,133
and former friend and all around louse.

627
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:38,354
- Well, it's nice to be dining
with Joe's close friends.

628
00:35:38,404 --> 00:35:39,730
It's nice to meet you, Martin.

629
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,032
- Pleasure to meet you, Patrice.

630
00:35:41,082 --> 00:35:42,253
- Lenetta, do you have a table for us?

631
00:35:42,303 --> 00:35:43,490
- Ooh, honey, if you want to do right

632
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,570
by this special child right here,

633
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,970
you all can sit at my table.

634
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,387
You all go on over there
and enjoy yourselves, okay?

635
00:35:50,437 --> 00:35:51,991
- Thank you, Lenetta.

636
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:53,314
How you been, man?

637
00:35:53,364 --> 00:35:55,530
- I've been okay, Joe. I've been okay.

638
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,674
(downbeat music)

639
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:00,010
- So where's Linda?

640
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,759
- Joe, can I talk to you for a second?

641
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:04,550
- I get it. She's going
to burst in any moment.

642
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,293
Talking about the story
trail's getting hot.

643
00:36:07,343 --> 00:36:11,650
I told you, baby. Don't start
today, Martin, where is she?

644
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,649
- Joe, there's something
that I want to tell you.

645
00:36:13,699 --> 00:36:16,005
And I don't think you want me
to say it in front of Patrice.

646
00:36:16,055 --> 00:36:16,838
- What do you mean?

647
00:36:16,888 --> 00:36:17,679
You can say anything you want to say to me

648
00:36:17,729 --> 00:36:19,799
in front of Patrice.

649
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:22,521
Come on. Don't start today,
all right, where's Linda?

650
00:36:22,571 --> 00:36:25,436
- Joe. I want to talk to you alone.

651
00:36:25,486 --> 00:36:28,303
- Martin. I just told
you, this is Patrice.

652
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:31,663
You can say anything you want
to say to me in front of her.

653
00:36:31,713 --> 00:36:33,001
- Linda's dead.

654
00:36:33,051 --> 00:36:35,241
(downbeat music)

655
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:36,239
- What?
- She's dead.

656
00:36:36,289 --> 00:36:39,503
- What the hell you mean?
I just saw Linda yesterday.

657
00:36:39,553 --> 00:36:40,900
- Somebody slit her throat.

658
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,321
(downbeat music)

659
00:36:43,371 --> 00:36:45,454
- No. No, Martin, no, no!

660
00:36:50,529 --> 00:36:52,020
All right, Martin, listen,
what's going on here?

661
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:54,361
What are we really dealing with?

662
00:36:54,411 --> 00:36:55,480
- I know in my heart, she was murdered

663
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:58,836
by the people she was investigating.

664
00:36:58,886 --> 00:37:00,319
- Do the police know that?

665
00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:02,521
- Yes. I told them my suspicions.

666
00:37:02,571 --> 00:37:03,719
- Well, did they believe you?

667
00:37:03,769 --> 00:37:05,380
Do we have anything to back them up?

668
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:09,038
- Only what she suspected.
You know how Linda worked.

669
00:37:09,088 --> 00:37:10,701
She loved the high drama.

670
00:37:10,751 --> 00:37:15,458
You know, she loved to tell you
the whole story all at once.

671
00:37:15,508 --> 00:37:17,997
She didn't get a chance this time.

672
00:37:18,047 --> 00:37:18,999
And we certainly don't have enough

673
00:37:19,049 --> 00:37:22,703
to confront a prominent CEO
on a murder charge, do we?

674
00:37:22,753 --> 00:37:25,764
But I'll tell you, Joe, he killed her.

675
00:37:25,814 --> 00:37:28,657
That rotten son of a
bitch Markham killed her.

676
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:30,897
Or he had her killed.

677
00:37:30,947 --> 00:37:32,640
- Well, it's a police matter now.

678
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:35,860
You two need to grieve
over the loss of a friend.

679
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:38,564
- She was more than a friend.

680
00:37:38,614 --> 00:37:39,663
- I know you're hurt, Joe.

681
00:37:39,713 --> 00:37:42,130
- You're damn right I'm hurt.

682
00:37:43,905 --> 00:37:48,041
- Look, I got to go.
I'll call you tomorrow.

683
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:49,663
Pleasure meeting you, Patrice.

684
00:37:49,713 --> 00:37:50,546
- Yeah.

685
00:37:57,527 --> 00:37:59,103
- Kirkman, I've been looking for you.

686
00:37:59,153 --> 00:38:00,521
Someone left this on my desk.

687
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:03,654
- Thanks, Kelly. Linda's handwriting.

688
00:38:17,067 --> 00:38:20,457
- How many times have you
called him, about six now?

689
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:21,455
Look, I know you're concerned,

690
00:38:21,505 --> 00:38:23,612
but he hasn't called you back once.

691
00:38:23,662 --> 00:38:25,636
- Oh Mario, just don't say any more, okay?

692
00:38:25,686 --> 00:38:28,559
Don't risk what you and I have as friends.

693
00:38:28,609 --> 00:38:29,612
- Okay.

694
00:38:29,662 --> 00:38:30,949
- [Linda] It's all about rubber, Joe.

695
00:38:30,999 --> 00:38:33,273
Markham is raping the San
Duarte forest and bringing it

696
00:38:33,323 --> 00:38:35,876
on the sly through the
ports of Los Angeles,

697
00:38:35,926 --> 00:38:38,812
not paying a dime in
tariffs or import duties.

698
00:38:38,862 --> 00:38:40,393
He's got to have somebody in the port.

699
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,217
I mean, it's got to be a bigwig.

700
00:38:42,267 --> 00:38:43,593
Someone who can move container ships

701
00:38:43,643 --> 00:38:45,396
full of stuff unnoticed.

702
00:38:45,446 --> 00:38:49,876
My guess is Sea and Shoreman's
union boss, Harry Pesco.

703
00:38:49,926 --> 00:38:51,193
Joe, if you're listening to this,

704
00:38:51,243 --> 00:38:53,135
maybe I'm not there with you.

705
00:38:53,185 --> 00:38:57,768
So close it out for me, my
friend, for old time's sake.

706
00:38:59,163 --> 00:39:01,913
(downbeat music)

707
00:39:15,505 --> 00:39:17,922
- Can I come sit next to you?

708
00:39:27,345 --> 00:39:29,729
Come on, go over there.

709
00:39:29,779 --> 00:39:31,673
- No, he wants to be alone tonight.

710
00:39:31,723 --> 00:39:33,056
- No he doesn't.

711
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:36,612
How close were they, him and the woman?

712
00:39:36,662 --> 00:39:38,726
- Very close, like family.

713
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:42,233
- And it didn't really hit him until now.

714
00:39:42,283 --> 00:39:43,753
You see, that's the delay.

715
00:39:43,803 --> 00:39:45,471
If it's someone you really care about,

716
00:39:45,521 --> 00:39:47,688
the denial lasts 24 hours.

717
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:53,833
Do you really love this guy
you met just a week ago?

718
00:39:53,883 --> 00:39:56,692
- Yeah, Carolyn, I really do.

719
00:39:56,742 --> 00:39:59,659
- Then go over there and be needed.

720
00:40:00,796 --> 00:40:03,353
Patrice, I know how
long you've been waiting

721
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:05,113
for this to happen.

722
00:40:05,163 --> 00:40:08,111
Maybe even longer than you've known it.

723
00:40:08,161 --> 00:40:10,713
Don't back away because
of what's happened.

724
00:40:10,763 --> 00:40:12,051
No matter how terrible it is.

725
00:40:12,101 --> 00:40:13,548
Don't back away.
- I'm not backing away.

726
00:40:13,598 --> 00:40:15,129
Okay, I get it.

727
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:18,887
You're not backing away,
but you're backing up.

728
00:40:18,937 --> 00:40:20,770
Come on. He needs you.

729
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,949
And you are the only person
I know with strength enough

730
00:40:24,999 --> 00:40:28,390
to be needed by those who love you.

731
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,908
You know. Come on.

732
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:34,033
Sometimes guys are just too
chicken to reach out, right?

733
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:36,447
But if he's all you say he is,

734
00:40:36,497 --> 00:40:41,497
he's gonna grab you when he
sees you and hold on tight.

735
00:40:41,702 --> 00:40:43,035
- Hold on tight.

736
00:40:46,134 --> 00:40:46,967
Hi.
- Hi.

737
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:51,391
I thought maybe you
would like some company.

738
00:40:51,441 --> 00:40:52,604
But maybe you don't.
- No, listen.

739
00:40:52,654 --> 00:40:53,625
- Want any company.

740
00:40:53,675 --> 00:40:56,767
- Listen. I think Martin was right.

741
00:40:56,817 --> 00:40:59,689
I think Linda was murdered by
people she was investigating.

742
00:40:59,739 --> 00:41:02,656
- How can you be so sure?
- Come in.

743
00:41:04,152 --> 00:41:05,947
- [Linda] Unnoticed, my guess is

744
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:09,684
Sea and Shoreman's union boss Harry Pesco.

745
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:10,689
Joe, if you're listening to this,

746
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:12,502
maybe I'm not there with you.

747
00:41:12,552 --> 00:41:17,135
So close it out for me, my
friend, for old time's sake.

748
00:41:27,517 --> 00:41:30,684
- So what are you going to do with it?

749
00:41:35,213 --> 00:41:36,406
- Well, you heard Linda.

750
00:41:36,456 --> 00:41:39,623
I got to close this thing out for her.

751
00:41:40,557 --> 00:41:42,603
- Joe. This is a job for the authorities.

752
00:41:42,653 --> 00:41:44,566
You're a reporter.

753
00:41:44,616 --> 00:41:46,586
- No Patrice, you don't understand.

754
00:41:46,636 --> 00:41:50,006
I'm an investigative
reporter. This is what I do.

755
00:41:50,056 --> 00:41:51,105
- You said that these kinds of stories

756
00:41:51,155 --> 00:41:53,003
weren't important to you
anymore, that your life

757
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:56,006
and your focus was going
to be on the community.

758
00:41:56,056 --> 00:41:58,646
- Important? Somebody just
murdered my best friend.

759
00:41:58,696 --> 00:42:01,105
That's not important enough?

760
00:42:01,155 --> 00:42:02,941
- I'm sorry. That's not what I meant.

761
00:42:02,991 --> 00:42:05,505
- Look, this is getting personal.

762
00:42:05,555 --> 00:42:07,703
Markham and his thugs killed Linda.

763
00:42:07,753 --> 00:42:10,843
- And what can you do against
powerful people like that?

764
00:42:10,893 --> 00:42:12,060
- Expose them.

765
00:42:13,517 --> 00:42:16,523
This is not what I had planned for us now,

766
00:42:16,573 --> 00:42:18,523
but I got to do this.

767
00:42:18,573 --> 00:42:21,046
- And what is it that I'm doing?

768
00:42:21,096 --> 00:42:23,464
I'm just sitting at home,
waiting for you to decide

769
00:42:23,514 --> 00:42:26,006
to restart our lives together?

770
00:42:26,056 --> 00:42:29,223
- Honestly, I didn't think about that.

771
00:42:30,733 --> 00:42:31,566
Not today.

772
00:42:33,075 --> 00:42:34,825
- Think about it now.

773
00:42:35,677 --> 00:42:37,112
- Look, I love you,

774
00:42:37,162 --> 00:42:38,961
but this thing is
getting way too dangerous

775
00:42:39,011 --> 00:42:41,297
and I won't have you hurt.

776
00:42:41,347 --> 00:42:45,997
- That gallantry again. But
this time it's misplaced.

777
00:42:46,047 --> 00:42:49,037
You're about to risk your
life for your friend.

778
00:42:49,087 --> 00:42:50,420
Joe, look at me.

779
00:42:51,971 --> 00:42:54,936
You think I can't handle
it or that I don't want to?

780
00:42:54,986 --> 00:42:58,497
Which means you have not looked
deeply enough inside of me.

781
00:42:58,547 --> 00:43:00,140
- No, that's not it.

782
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:03,940
Look, I won't take
chances with you close by.

783
00:43:07,134 --> 00:43:10,634
- I guess you don't want company after all

784
00:43:13,328 --> 00:43:15,643
- Kirkman.
- Hey Kelly.

785
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:17,841
- Diane, will you make sure
Paul gets that? Thank you.

786
00:43:17,891 --> 00:43:21,265
- Kelly, you've been working
the harbor beat down there.

787
00:43:21,315 --> 00:43:23,140
What's up with Harry Pesco?

788
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:26,684
- Pesco? Why the sudden interest in him?

789
00:43:26,734 --> 00:43:27,863
- I just been knocking around a story

790
00:43:27,913 --> 00:43:29,361
in my head about the waterfront unions.

791
00:43:29,411 --> 00:43:32,828
- JK, be careful out there in the Harbor.

792
00:43:35,091 --> 00:43:36,998
You ask anything negative about him.

793
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:38,700
You are liable to get one of those hooks

794
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,667
right in your gazoikas.

795
00:43:42,847 --> 00:43:44,717
- Thanks, Kelly.

796
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:47,517
(sinister music)

797
00:43:52,931 --> 00:43:53,879
- Hi.

798
00:43:53,929 --> 00:43:54,712
- Hi.

799
00:43:54,762 --> 00:43:55,601
- I'm kind of new in the neighborhood.

800
00:43:55,651 --> 00:43:57,164
I thought that maybe you could tell me

801
00:43:57,214 --> 00:43:59,002
where the nearest grocery store was at.

802
00:43:59,052 --> 00:44:01,041
- Just go two blocks down, make a right.

803
00:44:01,091 --> 00:44:03,258
- Thanks. Hey, San Duarte.

804
00:44:04,393 --> 00:44:05,759
I was there on vacation once.

805
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,197
Is that where you're headed?

806
00:44:07,247 --> 00:44:08,401
- No, I'm just doing research on it.

807
00:44:08,451 --> 00:44:09,863
- Well, hey, it's a great place.

808
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:11,463
If you ever need anybody to talk

809
00:44:11,513 --> 00:44:12,881
to you about the place, you know?

810
00:44:12,931 --> 00:44:14,023
- Okay. Well thanks.

811
00:44:14,073 --> 00:44:15,063
Gotta go.

812
00:44:15,113 --> 00:44:16,103
- All right.

813
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,070
- Thanks. Thanks a lot.

814
00:44:22,073 --> 00:44:23,100
You're right.

815
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:27,324
She's all over that San
Duarte shit. What now?

816
00:44:27,374 --> 00:44:29,905
- We do what Markham sent us to do.

817
00:44:29,955 --> 00:44:33,761
We find out what these
two know and take 'em out.

818
00:44:33,811 --> 00:44:36,561
(sinister music)

819
00:45:04,553 --> 00:45:09,220
- Back to work, yeah come on,
what do you think this is?

820
00:45:16,531 --> 00:45:19,281
(foghorn blares)

821
00:45:22,649 --> 00:45:23,795
- Mr. Pesco.
- Yeah, who wants to know?

822
00:45:23,845 --> 00:45:26,700
- Joe Kirkman, New Times Weekly.

823
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:28,379
- What can I do for you?

824
00:45:28,429 --> 00:45:29,377
- I'm interested in doing a profile

825
00:45:29,427 --> 00:45:31,239
on you and the port activities.

826
00:45:31,289 --> 00:45:33,356
Everyone says you're the
man to keep things moving.

827
00:45:33,406 --> 00:45:34,617
- And all of a sudden you
want to make me the cover boy

828
00:45:34,667 --> 00:45:38,556
on some paper that most
people read in public toilets?

829
00:45:38,606 --> 00:45:39,879
I'm underwhelmed.

830
00:45:39,929 --> 00:45:42,599
- Maybe you are, but we're
going to do the article.

831
00:45:42,649 --> 00:45:44,356
And if you cooperate,

832
00:45:44,406 --> 00:45:46,439
it'd go a long way with
getting the story right.

833
00:45:46,489 --> 00:45:49,136
- Oh yeah. How about this?

834
00:45:49,186 --> 00:45:50,140
How about you write

835
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:52,257
about endangered aardvarks in Santa Monica

836
00:45:52,307 --> 00:45:56,307
and stay the hell away
from my docks and my men.

837
00:45:57,891 --> 00:46:01,141
- You got something to hide, Mr. Pesco?

838
00:46:07,445 --> 00:46:08,737
- You see that?

839
00:46:08,787 --> 00:46:11,978
You see how easy it is not
to like you press monkeys?

840
00:46:12,028 --> 00:46:14,097
Let me give you some friendly advice, Joe.

841
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:18,730
Don't come around these ports.
You're not welcome here.

842
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:21,130
- Two PM Saturday.

843
00:46:22,409 --> 00:46:23,576
- Hi Joe.
- Hi.

844
00:46:24,787 --> 00:46:28,401
- It seems Colonel Delgado,
that San Duarte dictator,

845
00:46:28,451 --> 00:46:32,175
has been on a very expensive
spending spree lately.

846
00:46:32,225 --> 00:46:33,315
- Hold on.

847
00:46:33,365 --> 00:46:35,159
- He's also had his
interior ministry flunkies

848
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,179
inform the world bank
that there's been a blight

849
00:46:37,229 --> 00:46:39,916
on the country's rubber trees

850
00:46:39,966 --> 00:46:42,577
and that he will be unable to
meet his European commitment

851
00:46:42,627 --> 00:46:44,756
for deliveries this year.

852
00:46:44,806 --> 00:46:49,036
Of course, no one's been allowed
to confirm this disaster.

853
00:46:49,086 --> 00:46:51,003
It's all here. Read it.

854
00:46:52,845 --> 00:46:53,916
- Patrice!

855
00:46:53,966 --> 00:46:56,383

(Carolyn laughs)

873
00:47:55,412 --> 00:47:58,912
Well, somebody's feeling very happy today.

874
00:48:00,723 --> 00:48:02,140
- Bang. Zoom, eh?

875
00:48:04,462 --> 00:48:05,962
- Bang zoom?
- Yep.

876
00:48:07,886 --> 00:48:10,136
- Really? Really.
- Phillip?

877
00:48:11,102 --> 00:48:15,102
- Come on. Don't be
ridiculous, I met him today.

878
00:48:16,622 --> 00:48:18,753
- Okay, who is he? What does he do?

879
00:48:18,803 --> 00:48:20,135
- Don't know, don't care.

880
00:48:20,185 --> 00:48:22,492
- Oh, Carolyn, come on.

881
00:48:22,542 --> 00:48:24,192
- No judgment calls, remember?

882
00:48:24,242 --> 00:48:26,171
I'll let you have your bang zoom.

883
00:48:26,221 --> 00:48:28,554
You let me have mine, right?

884
00:48:37,198 --> 00:48:39,031
- Hi.
- Hi. Going out?

885
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,588
- Yeah I'm going to
meet Carolyn at a club.

886
00:48:42,638 --> 00:48:46,205
She's got a blind date.
She wants my approval.

887
00:48:46,255 --> 00:48:48,505
- You think she'd approve of me?

888
00:48:48,555 --> 00:48:51,649
- I don't know, why don't you
take a break and find out?

889
00:48:51,699 --> 00:48:53,699
- Okay. Mind if I drive?

890
00:48:54,579 --> 00:48:56,579
- No, not at all.
- Okay.

891
00:49:00,057 --> 00:49:03,148
I want to thank you for everything.

892
00:49:03,198 --> 00:49:06,305
- You don't do humble very well either.

893
00:49:06,355 --> 00:49:07,404
I like that.

894
00:49:07,454 --> 00:49:11,308
So what's your take on the
Delgado world bank scam?

895
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:12,988
- Well, it's like you found out.

896
00:49:13,038 --> 00:49:15,905
He screams poverty, gets a huge loan.

897
00:49:15,955 --> 00:49:18,124
Pays off the farmers dirt cheap.

898
00:49:18,174 --> 00:49:19,510
He delivers the rubber to Markham

899
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,495
and puts millions in his pocket.

900
00:49:21,545 --> 00:49:23,767
Markham sells his tax-free
import duty free rubber

901
00:49:23,817 --> 00:49:25,234
at a huge profit.

902
00:49:26,121 --> 00:49:28,455
- So getting the rubber into the country

903
00:49:28,505 --> 00:49:30,134
and past the customs people,

904
00:49:30,184 --> 00:49:33,052
that's where Harry Pesco comes in.

905
00:49:33,102 --> 00:49:36,290
Well, they must have an outlet
for selling the rubber right?

906
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,291
- Absolutely.

907
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:39,836
They have a subsidiary
right here in Santa Monica.

908
00:49:39,886 --> 00:49:42,273
Pan-American Resources.
It's the perfect front.

909
00:49:42,323 --> 00:49:44,636
- Well, if everything
that you suspect is true,

910
00:49:44,686 --> 00:49:48,492
and Markham did have your
friend Linda murdered,

911
00:49:48,542 --> 00:49:50,709
then he must be desperate.

912
00:49:51,919 --> 00:49:53,596
Plaxcom must be in trouble.

913
00:49:53,646 --> 00:49:57,196
- Not necessarily. You know what they say?

914
00:49:57,246 --> 00:49:58,792
Greed is greed.

915
00:49:58,842 --> 00:50:01,592
(sinister music)

916
00:50:22,243 --> 00:50:24,642
- Wait here for me.
- Yes sir.

917
00:50:24,692 --> 00:50:27,442
(sinister music)

918
00:50:33,006 --> 00:50:34,316
- Why all the sneaking around?

919
00:50:34,366 --> 00:50:35,692
- A reporter showed up with a fish story

920
00:50:35,742 --> 00:50:38,593
about writing me up in this local sheet.

921
00:50:38,643 --> 00:50:42,060
The New Times. I don't like coincidences.

922
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:46,135
- I don't either. What did you tell him?

923
00:50:46,185 --> 00:50:50,055
- What do you think? I
told him to get lost.

924
00:50:50,105 --> 00:50:51,591
Now you know something
you're not telling me?

925
00:50:51,641 --> 00:50:52,518
- What does that mean?

926
00:50:52,568 --> 00:50:55,351
- It means I got a lot at stake here

927
00:50:55,401 --> 00:50:58,935
and I want to know who's
at the table with us.

928
00:50:58,985 --> 00:51:01,208
- Kirkman.
- That's the guy.

929
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:04,759
What's going on, Markham?
- It's being handled.

930
00:51:04,809 --> 00:51:06,887
- So, mister, I'm about to introduce

931
00:51:06,937 --> 00:51:09,649
the best roommate I ever had.

932
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:12,204
I'm beginning to see what
the fuss is all about.

933
00:51:12,254 --> 00:51:13,391
- So how am I doing so far?

934
00:51:13,441 --> 00:51:15,372
- Oh, you're better
looking than your picture,

935
00:51:15,422 --> 00:51:19,089
but are you honest, forthright, sincere?

936
00:51:19,139 --> 00:51:21,271
Ah, who cares, you're better
looking than your picture.

937
00:51:21,321 --> 00:51:22,609
- I told you about her.

938
00:51:22,659 --> 00:51:25,551
- Yes you did. She also
told me you're from Norway.

939
00:51:25,601 --> 00:51:28,172
Oslo Accord. Last story
I did for the Post.

940
00:51:28,222 --> 00:51:29,186
- You should have called me.

941
00:51:29,236 --> 00:51:31,372
I would have put you onto some great lox.

942
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:33,852
- That's it. I'll have to go back.

943
00:51:33,902 --> 00:51:35,965
- So where's your fella?

944
00:51:36,015 --> 00:51:39,612
- Fella? It's not exactly how
anyone would describe him.

945
00:51:39,662 --> 00:51:41,852
He looks like the best
looking wanted poster

946
00:51:41,902 --> 00:51:43,772
in the post office.

947
00:51:43,822 --> 00:51:48,289
- Hence the attraction. Carolyn
loves the dangerous type.

948
00:51:48,339 --> 00:51:51,633
- Are you dangerous, Joe?
- In a pinch.

949
00:51:51,683 --> 00:51:53,351
I guess I could be pretty irritable.

950
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:56,049
- I like him.
- The ultimate blessing.

951
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:57,729
Or a curse.

952
00:51:57,779 --> 00:51:59,372
- You made it.

953
00:51:59,422 --> 00:52:02,951
Oh, this is my roommate Patrice
Summers and Joe Kirkman.

954
00:52:03,001 --> 00:52:04,129
- John Smith.
- Pleasure.

955
00:52:04,179 --> 00:52:08,033
- John Smith? Come on,
is that really your name?

956
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,689
- I'll change if you like.

957
00:52:09,739 --> 00:52:12,332
- Careful, John, she might ask.

958
00:52:12,382 --> 00:52:13,452
- I'm familiar with your work.

959
00:52:13,502 --> 00:52:15,111
I used to live in Washington.

960
00:52:15,161 --> 00:52:16,951
Are you here in LA on a story?

961
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:20,871
- Is that what my roommate was
doing today, working for you?

962
00:52:20,921 --> 00:52:24,353
I saw that stuff from some
guy named Colonel Delgado.

963
00:52:24,403 --> 00:52:26,513
- Carolyn.
- Alexio Delgado?

964
00:52:26,563 --> 00:52:29,885
Yeah, the San Duarte strong
man. I hear he's bad news.

965
00:52:29,935 --> 00:52:31,671
- Pretty well-informed, Mr. Smith.

966
00:52:31,721 --> 00:52:33,409
- I try to keep up with what's happening.

967
00:52:33,459 --> 00:52:34,689
It helps in my business.
- What business would that be?

968
00:52:34,739 --> 00:52:38,072
- Personal security.
- Personal security?

969
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:41,713
Sounds exciting.
- Is it?

970
00:52:41,763 --> 00:52:43,489
- Nah, it's dull most of the time.

971
00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:46,213
- Guarding anybody interestingly lately?

972
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:49,108
- If you consider corporate
types interesting.

973
00:52:49,158 --> 00:52:51,228
- Some of them can be.

974
00:52:51,278 --> 00:52:53,127
- Not my clients.

975
00:52:53,177 --> 00:52:56,188
So Joe, tell me about
this Delgado situation.

976
00:52:56,238 --> 00:52:59,228
- Nah, that's a boring subject.

977
00:52:59,278 --> 00:53:01,695
- I'm sure. Pardon me, Smith.

978
00:53:04,419 --> 00:53:05,252
- It's me.

979
00:53:08,234 --> 00:53:10,951
He's getting awfully annoying.

980
00:53:11,001 --> 00:53:12,001
- I noticed.

981
00:53:12,957 --> 00:53:14,587
- Where are you?

982
00:53:14,637 --> 00:53:17,970
- I'm at a club with some friends. Yeah.

983
00:53:19,401 --> 00:53:21,431
- You know what you have to do?

984
00:53:21,481 --> 00:53:22,398
- Yes I do.

985
00:53:26,659 --> 00:53:27,607
Sorry.

986
00:53:27,657 --> 00:53:29,707
- Business?
- And pleasure.

987
00:53:29,757 --> 00:53:31,442
- Ooh, I'm jealous already.

988
00:53:31,492 --> 00:53:32,275
- I'm going to powder my nose.

989
00:53:32,325 --> 00:53:33,324
Come with me to the ladies room.

990
00:53:33,374 --> 00:53:34,740
- Don't want to.
- Come on.

991
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:37,623
- Okay, I'm coming. Be right back.

992
00:53:39,371 --> 00:53:42,371
- You might as well.
- Might as well.

993
00:53:44,435 --> 00:53:48,583
- Okay, what's on your
mind, little mother?

994
00:53:48,633 --> 00:53:50,215
- I don't trust him.

995
00:53:50,265 --> 00:53:53,505
- Who, Joe? Please, he's a boy scout.

996
00:53:53,555 --> 00:53:57,370
- Don't be funny. You know I mean Smith.

997
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:59,282
- I think you're jealous.

998
00:53:59,332 --> 00:54:03,783
Maybe you picked your super
honey a little too soon.

999
00:54:03,833 --> 00:54:05,860
- There's something about him.

1000
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,910
- Mmm, yes, isn't there?

1001
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:11,884
- So you're not with the Post anymore.

1002
00:54:11,934 --> 00:54:14,487
- No, I'm not. How about yourself?

1003
00:54:14,537 --> 00:54:16,645
How'd you get into your line of business?

1004
00:54:16,695 --> 00:54:17,644
- I'm just naturally good

1005
00:54:17,694 --> 00:54:20,700
at keeping certain people
from being disturbed.

1006
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:23,114
- Imagine it pays pretty well.

1007
00:54:23,164 --> 00:54:25,585
- The bigger the disturbance
that needs eliminating,

1008
00:54:25,635 --> 00:54:27,964
the bigger the fee.

1009
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:30,007
- Pretty dangerous too, I guess.

1010
00:54:30,057 --> 00:54:31,557
- Can be for them.

1011
00:54:32,718 --> 00:54:35,968
- God he is hot. My panties are soaked.

1012
00:54:37,395 --> 00:54:39,447
- Do you have to be so obvious?

1013
00:54:39,497 --> 00:54:41,767
- Yeah. Look who's talking?

1014
00:54:41,817 --> 00:54:44,461
Coming home tonight?

1015
00:54:44,511 --> 00:54:46,879
- I don't know what's going to happen.

1016
00:54:46,929 --> 00:54:50,188
- Come on. He came to
apologize then, didn't he?

1017
00:54:50,238 --> 00:54:53,585
You cannot let the poor boy suffer.

1018
00:54:53,635 --> 00:54:54,588
- Okay. I'm serious.

1019
00:54:54,638 --> 00:54:55,948
I think you need to watch out for this guy

1020
00:54:55,998 --> 00:54:58,305
because he seems like he
could be really dangerous.

1021
00:54:58,355 --> 00:55:01,105
- Yeah, well, I hope he's deadly.

1022
00:55:02,414 --> 00:55:03,747
- No, I mean it.

1023
00:55:06,355 --> 00:55:10,625
- Come on, Patrice, you're
judging, you're judging me.

1024
00:55:10,675 --> 00:55:13,925
- Okay, okay, okay.
- No, it's not okay.

1025
00:55:15,491 --> 00:55:19,241
- Oh, just, I love you
and I worry about you.

1026
00:55:22,249 --> 00:55:23,499
Mostly I worry.

1027
00:55:27,145 --> 00:55:29,145
She is so, so.
- So what?

1028
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:36,034
I assume you're talking about Carolyn.

1029
00:55:36,084 --> 00:55:39,554
- Never mind. What'd you think of her?

1030
00:55:39,604 --> 00:55:41,771
- I liked her. She's real.

1031
00:55:43,251 --> 00:55:45,120
- What about John Smith?

1032
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:49,980
- Oh, the tough guy, in his
business, I assume that's a plus.

1033
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:52,001
- I did not like him.

1034
00:55:52,051 --> 00:55:53,260
- Well, would that matter to her?

1035
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:54,460
You said she wanted your approval.

1036
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:56,474
- Yeah, only if it agrees with her.

1037
00:55:56,524 --> 00:55:59,395
(Joe laughs)

1038
00:55:59,445 --> 00:56:01,879
So what do you think, you
wanna take a walk on the beach?

1039
00:56:01,929 --> 00:56:03,761
I think he's going to be invited in.

1040
00:56:03,811 --> 00:56:04,594
- Sure.

1041
00:56:04,644 --> 00:56:07,394

- John?

1092
00:59:23,329 --> 00:59:26,079
(sinister music)

1093
01:00:20,907 --> 01:00:22,490
What are you doing?

1094
01:00:26,427 --> 01:00:28,132
- That's not a toy you're holding.

1095
01:00:28,182 --> 01:00:32,819
- I asked what the hell you're
doing at Patrice's computer.

1096
01:00:32,869 --> 01:00:36,036
- Give me the gun.
- Stay away from me.

1097
01:00:36,949 --> 01:00:38,373
Stay away from me.

1098
01:00:38,423 --> 01:00:43,423
(both grunt)
(sinister music)

1099
01:00:46,385 --> 01:00:48,138
- You shoulda stayed in bed.

1100
01:00:48,188 --> 01:00:50,938
(sinister music)

1101
01:00:51,846 --> 01:00:53,135
Now write.

1102
01:00:53,185 --> 01:00:55,935
(sinister music)

1103
01:01:04,065 --> 01:01:06,982
(Carolyn whimpers)

1104
01:01:11,308 --> 01:01:12,745
(Carolyn screams)

1105
01:01:12,795 --> 01:01:14,233
- Too bad this was business.

1106
01:01:14,283 --> 01:01:15,866
You're a great lay.

1107
01:01:17,162 --> 01:01:22,162
(Carolyn screams)
(sinister music)

1108
01:01:24,083 --> 01:01:26,139
- Well, according to the
international ship registry,

1109
01:01:26,189 --> 01:01:29,234
a big freighter left the port
of Harango in San Duarte,

1110
01:01:29,284 --> 01:01:32,356
four days ago, was supposed
to haul bananas to Chile.

1111
01:01:32,406 --> 01:01:36,218
It never arrived at Santiago
and nobody seems to care.

1112
01:01:36,268 --> 01:01:39,796
- That has to be it.
- I think so too.

1113
01:01:39,846 --> 01:01:41,796
The ship's called the Colombian,

1114
01:01:41,846 --> 01:01:43,737
it's Liberian register,
the ship's a drench

1115
01:01:43,787 --> 01:01:45,037
at 460 foot 84 tons.

1116
01:01:48,143 --> 01:01:52,154
Let me make some calls,
see what else I can dig up.

1117
01:01:52,204 --> 01:01:54,175
You know something, Joe?

1118
01:01:54,225 --> 01:01:56,787
I know you don't believe it

1119
01:01:56,837 --> 01:01:58,959
but I used to be a pretty good reporter.

1120
01:01:59,009 --> 01:02:01,039
- I heard about you, Marty.

1121
01:02:01,089 --> 01:02:03,672
(somber music)

1122
01:02:07,228 --> 01:02:08,965
- Hey, what's wrong?

1123
01:02:09,015 --> 01:02:11,598
(somber music)

1124
01:02:16,225 --> 01:02:18,558
- Carolyn left me this note.

1125
01:02:19,489 --> 01:02:21,818
Pats, John swept me off
my feet and swept me away.

1126
01:02:21,868 --> 01:02:23,716
We're off to a secret
hideaway in the Caribbean.

1127
01:02:23,766 --> 01:02:27,076
I'll call you when we come up for air.

1128
01:02:27,126 --> 01:02:29,755
Doesn't that sound strange to you?

1129
01:02:29,805 --> 01:02:32,638
- You still worried about Carolyn?

1130
01:02:33,796 --> 01:02:36,146
Well, has she done
anything like that before?

1131
01:02:36,196 --> 01:02:39,722
- Well, yes, occasionally.
She likes adventure.

1132
01:02:39,772 --> 01:02:41,772
- So what's the problem?

1133
01:02:46,516 --> 01:02:48,516
- I'm worried about her.

1134
01:02:50,253 --> 01:02:51,789
- You read the note.

1135
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:54,146
When she comes up for air,
she'll give you a call.

1136
01:02:54,196 --> 01:02:56,567
You'll tell her she picked
the wrong man again.

1137
01:02:56,617 --> 01:02:58,727
It all will be fine. Cool out.

1138
01:02:58,777 --> 01:03:00,110
- Yeah. I guess.

1139
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:05,343
- Listen, I got to go out.
- Where are you going?

1140
01:03:05,393 --> 01:03:07,426
- To the Harbor.

1141
01:03:07,476 --> 01:03:09,367
- Well then I'm going with you.

1142
01:03:09,417 --> 01:03:11,367
- No, you're not, Patrice,
it could be dangerous

1143
01:03:11,417 --> 01:03:12,749
and a lot of trouble.

1144
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:13,805
- You're going to have
a lot of trouble with me

1145
01:03:13,855 --> 01:03:15,426
if you don't take me.

1146
01:03:15,476 --> 01:03:16,626
I'll drive you down there.

1147
01:03:16,676 --> 01:03:18,407
I'll stay wherever you want me to stay.

1148
01:03:18,457 --> 01:03:20,205
And you'll have somebody
to tell all the details to

1149
01:03:20,255 --> 01:03:21,447
when you get back.

1150
01:03:21,497 --> 01:03:25,265
- No you're not going.
And I'm very serious.

1151
01:03:25,315 --> 01:03:26,148
- So am I.

1152
01:03:28,516 --> 01:03:31,266
(foghorn blares)

1153
01:03:45,135 --> 01:03:45,968
- What?

1154
01:03:46,970 --> 01:03:51,082
- She always leaves me
her messages in my email.

1155
01:03:51,132 --> 01:03:55,046
She likes to send me little
jokes and she knows my password.

1156
01:03:55,096 --> 01:03:59,083
And she sends me no email,
no jokes, no nothing.

1157
01:03:59,133 --> 01:04:01,962
- I doubt very much if that's
what she had in her mind

1158
01:04:02,012 --> 01:04:05,512
if she was packing for the Virgin islands.

1159
01:04:08,057 --> 01:04:11,146
(sinister music)

1160
01:04:11,196 --> 01:04:14,669
- Okay, that's it, that's the Columbian.

1161
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:17,991
All right, keep the engine
running. Lock your doors.

1162
01:04:18,041 --> 01:04:20,356
If you see anyone coming, just go.

1163
01:04:20,406 --> 01:04:23,245
- If you find those containers
are full of raw rubber,

1164
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:24,967
can't we just call customs?

1165
01:04:25,017 --> 01:04:25,982
I mean, that will accomplish

1166
01:04:26,032 --> 01:04:27,346
what you're trying to do, won't it?

1167
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:29,063
- No, I want Markham.

1168
01:04:30,356 --> 01:04:33,266
I want Markham and the
proof he killed Linda.

1169
01:04:33,316 --> 01:04:34,816
- You want it all.

1170
01:04:36,196 --> 01:04:37,266
Be careful.

1171
01:04:37,316 --> 01:04:40,386
(somber music)

1172
01:04:40,436 --> 01:04:41,802
- Lock the doors.

1173
01:04:41,852 --> 01:04:44,852
(suspenseful music)

1174
01:05:16,432 --> 01:05:17,463
- As long as Michael is free

1175
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:19,263
then the Lakers got no shot.

1176
01:05:19,313 --> 01:05:21,085
- Yeah, but he's not coming back.

1177
01:05:21,135 --> 01:05:23,885
(sinister music)

1178
01:06:31,397 --> 01:06:36,397
(men grunt)
(sinister music)

1179
01:06:47,794 --> 01:06:49,127
- Hit him, Gus.

1180
01:06:53,178 --> 01:06:55,511
(men laugh)

1181
01:06:56,656 --> 01:06:58,989
- Come on, come on, come on.

1182
01:07:02,306 --> 01:07:04,639
(men grunt)

1183
01:07:05,957 --> 01:07:07,957
Come on, finish him off.

1184
01:07:11,439 --> 01:07:14,829
- Crack you like a rotten
fucking egg. (laughs)

1185
01:07:14,879 --> 01:07:16,429
Get ready to bleed scoop.

1186
01:07:16,479 --> 01:07:21,479
(men grunt)
(sinister music)

1187
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:47,004
- Motherfucker, I'm going
to kill you so dead.

1188
01:07:47,054 --> 01:07:52,054
(men grunt)
(suspenseful music)

1189
01:08:23,141 --> 01:08:24,891
- All right, come on.

1190
01:08:26,277 --> 01:08:29,277
He ain't gonna be coming
back this way anymore.

1191
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:42,579
(phone beeps)

1192
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:48,829
She's in.

1193
01:08:48,879 --> 01:08:51,379
(engine revs)

1194
01:08:52,897 --> 01:08:55,647
(sinister music)

1195
01:09:29,978 --> 01:09:32,909
- [Patrice] Oh my God. What happened?

1196
01:09:32,959 --> 01:09:37,459
- [Joe] I'm all right, let's
get the hell out of here.

1197
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:40,888
What happened? Why the hell'd you leave?

1198
01:09:40,938 --> 01:09:42,429
- [Patrice] This black van was chasing me,

1199
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:43,469
and you hadn't-
- A black van?

1200
01:09:43,519 --> 01:09:46,102
(somber music)

1201
01:09:48,218 --> 01:09:49,742
(Joe whimpers)

1202
01:09:49,792 --> 01:09:52,959
- Joe, you need to go to the hospital.

1203
01:09:54,917 --> 01:09:59,412
- No, I ain't got no
time for that shit now.

1204
01:09:59,462 --> 01:10:02,691
You see what I mean? I can't
have you involved with this.

1205
01:10:02,741 --> 01:10:04,093
You could have been hurt or even worse.

1206
01:10:04,143 --> 01:10:06,189
- Doesn't matter now. They know about me.

1207
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:08,173
And you're stuck with me.

1208
01:10:08,223 --> 01:10:11,192
- I just lost my best friend.
I'm not gonna lose you too.

1209
01:10:11,242 --> 01:10:14,105
- You're never going to lose me.

1210
01:10:14,155 --> 01:10:18,595
- You're pretty tough for
a little girl from Encino.

1211
01:10:18,645 --> 01:10:20,228
- You have no idea.

1212
01:10:24,645 --> 01:10:26,115
What next?

1213
01:10:26,165 --> 01:10:27,512
- My father always said,
when you want something done,

1214
01:10:27,562 --> 01:10:28,856
you gotta go straight to the source.

1215
01:10:28,906 --> 01:10:31,656
(sinister music)

1216
01:10:36,678 --> 01:10:38,010
I want to see Markham.
- Can I help you?

1217
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:41,060
- I want to see Markham.
- One moment.

1218
01:10:44,266 --> 01:10:47,589
Miss Allen, there's a gentleman
out here to see Mr. Markham.

1219
01:10:47,639 --> 01:10:49,889
- Now.
- And he's insisting.

1220
01:10:51,583 --> 01:10:53,166
Yeah. Okay, thanks.

1221
01:10:54,782 --> 01:10:57,865
She'll be right with you.
- Thank you.

1222
01:11:00,826 --> 01:11:02,712
- May I help you?
- I want to see Markham.

1223
01:11:02,762 --> 01:11:06,354
- Mr. Markham is busy. Did
you have an appointment?

1224
01:11:06,404 --> 01:11:08,552
- Just tell them it's Joe
Kirkman from the Washington Post.

1225
01:11:08,602 --> 01:11:11,013
- Oh, I see Mr. Kirkman.

1226
01:11:11,063 --> 01:11:13,293
Well, I'm afraid Mr. Markham
rarely gives interviews.

1227
01:11:13,343 --> 01:11:15,496
Perhaps if you leave your
card, he'll get back to you.

1228
01:11:15,546 --> 01:11:16,776
- Where is he?

1229
01:11:16,826 --> 01:11:18,789
- He's in conference.

1230
01:11:18,839 --> 01:11:20,136
- Well, I suggest you go in conference

1231
01:11:20,186 --> 01:11:21,133
and tell him I'm here.

1232
01:11:21,183 --> 01:11:22,675
I want to talk to him now.

1233
01:11:22,725 --> 01:11:25,091
- Mr. Kirkman, you cannot
just barge right in here

1234
01:11:25,141 --> 01:11:26,733
and speak to Mr. Markham.

1235
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:27,953
- Lady. Do you like your job?
- Excuse me?

1236
01:11:28,003 --> 01:11:30,653
- If you do, I suggest you go in there

1237
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:32,392
and you tell them I
want to talk to him now

1238
01:11:32,442 --> 01:11:33,715
or we talk on the deck of the Colombian

1239
01:11:33,765 --> 01:11:35,395
in front of 50 cameras.

1240
01:11:35,445 --> 01:11:38,792
Trust me. He'll want that message.

1241
01:11:38,842 --> 01:11:41,731
- Well, wait here and
don't touch anything.

1242
01:11:41,781 --> 01:11:43,875
We have security cameras everywhere.

1243
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:45,112
- Just get Markham.

1244
01:11:45,162 --> 01:11:47,912
(sinister music)

1245
01:11:52,485 --> 01:11:57,485
Guys have any idea who you
work for? I didn't think so.

1246
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:02,317
- Do you have that contract,
that Blackwell contract?

1247
01:12:02,367 --> 01:12:03,315
Right.

1248
01:12:03,365 --> 01:12:06,865
- Mr. Markham will see you now
- Thank you.

1249
01:12:12,805 --> 01:12:16,275
- Mr. Kirkman. I am a very busy man.

1250
01:12:16,325 --> 01:12:17,757
I have no time for you.

1251
01:12:17,807 --> 01:12:21,016
- Save the bullshit. You knew
I was in that dock last night.

1252
01:12:21,066 --> 01:12:23,576
And I know what you and that
slimey ass Pesco are up to.

1253
01:12:23,626 --> 01:12:25,235
- All right. No bullshit.

1254
01:12:25,285 --> 01:12:27,416
But you don't know who
you're fucking with.

1255
01:12:27,466 --> 01:12:28,419
I don't know what you think you know,

1256
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:30,557
but you don't know shit.

1257
01:12:30,607 --> 01:12:32,717
Now you came here to threaten me.

1258
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:36,074
I have been threatened by men
who eat their own children.

1259
01:12:36,124 --> 01:12:38,856
Now I'm going to tell you
what you are going to do.

1260
01:12:38,906 --> 01:12:41,779
You are going to stay the
fuck out of my business.

1261
01:12:41,829 --> 01:12:43,698
If you don't, I'm going to put a bullet

1262
01:12:43,748 --> 01:12:45,437
right in your fucking head.

1263
01:12:45,487 --> 01:12:46,755
- Oh, similar to the way you slashed

1264
01:12:46,805 --> 01:12:48,637
Linda Cray's throat, huh?

1265
01:12:48,687 --> 01:12:51,059
Oh yeah. I know a lot more
than you think I know.

1266
01:12:51,109 --> 01:12:53,197
And she was onto your big game too.

1267
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:54,195
And let me tell you something.

1268
01:12:54,245 --> 01:12:55,475
You don't know who you're fucking with.

1269
01:12:55,525 --> 01:12:58,536
I'm taking you down, Markham.
I'm watching your ass burn.

1270
01:12:58,586 --> 01:13:00,877
You killed my best friend
and I'm taking you down.

1271
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:02,755
- Get the fuck out of my building.

1272
01:13:02,805 --> 01:13:06,976
- You're going down, Markham.
I know my way outta here.

1273
01:13:07,026 --> 01:13:09,492
(sinister music)

1274
01:13:09,542 --> 01:13:11,334
- So you've been busy.

1275
01:13:11,384 --> 01:13:12,755
- Listen, to hell with Markham.

1276
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:14,975
It's time we pulled the cover off his ass.

1277
01:13:15,025 --> 01:13:17,124
- Oh, is that right? And
what about the story?

1278
01:13:17,174 --> 01:13:19,576
The exclusive. I thought
you wanted that for Linda.

1279
01:13:19,626 --> 01:13:20,409
- The longer we wait,

1280
01:13:20,459 --> 01:13:21,597
the more people are going to be destroyed.

1281
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,210
Somebody like Markham has to be stopped.

1282
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:25,635
- And then what, you and Patrice run off

1283
01:13:25,685 --> 01:13:27,517
and live happily ever after?

1284
01:13:27,567 --> 01:13:29,096
- Don't patronize me.

1285
01:13:29,146 --> 01:13:31,795
- Hey, you know me better than
that. That's not my style.

1286
01:13:31,845 --> 01:13:33,677
You want to go public?
Make a lot of noise.

1287
01:13:33,727 --> 01:13:36,435
Fine. You'll inconvenience
the guy a little bit.

1288
01:13:36,485 --> 01:13:38,056
So instead of bringing the
rubber here, he'll port it out

1289
01:13:38,106 --> 01:13:41,235
in new Orleans and his trucks
will have a longer drive.

1290
01:13:41,285 --> 01:13:42,957
The minute you accuse
him of Linda's murder

1291
01:13:43,007 --> 01:13:46,275
without a shred of evidence, guess what?

1292
01:13:46,325 --> 01:13:47,660
You'll become the bad guy.

1293
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:49,549
- You got a better idea? Spit it out.

1294
01:13:49,599 --> 01:13:52,599
- Yeah, I do. Remember Bobby Chickle?

1295
01:13:55,882 --> 01:13:58,429
- Chicklets, Linda and I
were just talking about him

1296
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:00,312
before she was killed.

1297
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:03,351
He's doing 18 years at Marion.

1298
01:14:03,401 --> 01:14:07,110
- No, he's not, Joe. He's
out and he's on his way here.

1299
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:08,813
- What, are you getting
daring in your old age?

1300
01:14:08,863 --> 01:14:12,072
- Did you forget? Linda was
your mentor at the Post.

1301
01:14:12,122 --> 01:14:16,691
Who do you think was hers? Me. (laughs)

1302
01:14:16,741 --> 01:14:19,491
(sinister music)

1303
01:14:40,978 --> 01:14:43,493
- Joe.
- What's going on?

1304
01:14:43,543 --> 01:14:45,871
- Kirkman.
- Joe Kirkman.

1305
01:14:45,921 --> 01:14:47,973
- Yeah, I'm Joe Kirkman. What's going on?

1306
01:14:48,023 --> 01:14:52,090
- I'm Detective Cogan. This
is Detective Hail, LAPD.

1307
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:54,709
About two nights ago, you
went out with Ms. Summers

1308
01:14:54,759 --> 01:14:56,509
and Caroline Thomasson, her roommate.

1309
01:14:58,979 --> 01:15:00,271
She was on a blind date with a guy

1310
01:15:00,321 --> 01:15:02,390
by the name of John Smith.

1311
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:03,369
(Patrice sobs)

1312
01:15:03,419 --> 01:15:05,169
- Oh my God, Carolyn.

1313
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:11,588
- We have a very strong
description of this John Smith.

1314
01:15:11,638 --> 01:15:12,907
And we're going to catch him.

1315
01:15:12,957 --> 01:15:15,449
Is there anything you can add?

1316
01:15:15,499 --> 01:15:16,751
- No.

1317
01:15:16,801 --> 01:15:18,628
- Well then we'd like for you
to come down to the station

1318
01:15:18,678 --> 01:15:20,768
and look through our mug file.

1319
01:15:20,818 --> 01:15:22,388
- I can't, I'm busy today.

1320
01:15:22,438 --> 01:15:23,391
- What's that about?

1321
01:15:23,441 --> 01:15:24,388
You're not interested in catching the punk

1322
01:15:24,438 --> 01:15:26,308
that did your girlfriend's roommate?

1323
01:15:26,358 --> 01:15:28,321
- Take it easy, Hail.

1324
01:15:28,371 --> 01:15:29,364
So does this mean that
you're not going to cooperate

1325
01:15:29,414 --> 01:15:31,065
with our investigation?

1326
01:15:31,115 --> 01:15:34,032
- I said I'm busy today. Excuse me.

1327
01:15:36,155 --> 01:15:37,508
- Okay. Mr. Kirkman.

1328
01:15:37,558 --> 01:15:40,447
- How could you put Patrice in danger?

1329
01:15:40,497 --> 01:15:42,883
I bet you had something to
do with poor Carolyn as well.

1330
01:15:42,933 --> 01:15:44,441
- I'm going to find
out what happened here.

1331
01:15:44,491 --> 01:15:47,462
- You do that and then
keep her out of your life.

1332
01:15:47,512 --> 01:15:49,961
- I don't know you, but I can
see how you feel about her.

1333
01:15:50,011 --> 01:15:51,522
- I don't care what you know.

1334
01:15:51,572 --> 01:15:55,583
I know that a week ago
she was content and happy.

1335
01:15:55,633 --> 01:15:58,441
You walk into her life
and it's a living hell.

1336
01:15:58,491 --> 01:15:59,778
- That's about as much
of your petty jealousies

1337
01:15:59,828 --> 01:16:00,905
I'm going to take.

1338
01:16:00,955 --> 01:16:02,804
- Petty jealousy. You son of a bitch!

1339
01:16:02,854 --> 01:16:04,771
- Stop it. Both of you.

1340
01:16:08,491 --> 01:16:11,074
I want to talk to Joseph alone.

1341
01:16:13,014 --> 01:16:15,682
- Patrice, if Linda and
Carolyn's death are connected

1342
01:16:15,732 --> 01:16:19,067
and John Smith is
responsible, I'll find out.

1343
01:16:19,117 --> 01:16:21,001
- Yeah, you probably will.

1344
01:16:21,051 --> 01:16:23,241
But what is that going to do?

1345
01:16:23,291 --> 01:16:24,820
They're not going to magically reappear

1346
01:16:24,870 --> 01:16:28,373
because you find out who
the killer is, are they?

1347
01:16:28,423 --> 01:16:31,875
But you're just going to go
ahead and pursue the answer

1348
01:16:31,925 --> 01:16:35,108
until they finally just kill you too.

1349
01:16:35,158 --> 01:16:38,025
- I don't have a death wish

1350
01:16:38,075 --> 01:16:40,884
but I need to do something
for Linda and Carolyn.

1351
01:16:40,934 --> 01:16:42,625
- Like what?

1352
01:16:42,675 --> 01:16:44,927
- At first, I thought it was vengeance.

1353
01:16:44,977 --> 01:16:47,607
But the proper way to honor
them would be to find justice.

1354
01:16:47,657 --> 01:16:49,857
- And when you find justice

1355
01:16:49,907 --> 01:16:53,520
and if you're not killed, then what next?

1356
01:16:53,570 --> 01:16:56,070
- I can't answer that for you.

1357
01:16:58,230 --> 01:16:59,897
- I guess you can't.

1358
01:17:01,563 --> 01:17:03,646
Mario, I want to go home.

1359
01:17:04,571 --> 01:17:07,488
- Do you want me to drive you?
- No.

1360
01:17:13,313 --> 01:17:18,146
- Kirkman, I may not be the
poet warrior she always wanted

1361
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:21,961
but I never would have
risked her life for my ego.

1362
01:17:22,011 --> 01:17:24,761
- You know what, Mario? Fuck you.

1363
01:17:31,608 --> 01:17:32,724
- [Man] You wanted me, sir?

1364
01:17:32,774 --> 01:17:36,857
- Yes. We have a hundred
tons of rubber at the plant.

1365
01:17:37,771 --> 01:17:38,980
So call the buyers

1366
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:41,165
and tell them to expect
delivery next week.

1367
01:17:41,215 --> 01:17:42,080
- Certainly, sir.

1368
01:17:42,130 --> 01:17:43,181
- Yo editor man.

1369
01:17:43,231 --> 01:17:45,593
Yeah, I already been to the Plaxcom baby.

1370
01:17:45,643 --> 01:17:47,795
I took the 50 cent tour.

1371
01:17:47,845 --> 01:17:49,960
Because that's my business.

1372
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:52,520
Of course you can't do the job.

1373
01:17:52,570 --> 01:17:55,021
Man, that's why you brought me here.

1374
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:57,298
Yeah. I'll see you boys tonight.

1375
01:17:57,348 --> 01:18:00,200
Look, I got to go. I
got some shopping to do.

1376
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:02,040
None of your business, man.

1377
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:04,397
Look, editor, just have a big wad of money

1378
01:18:04,447 --> 01:18:05,917
waiting for me, okay?

1379
01:18:05,967 --> 01:18:06,800
Later.

1380
01:18:17,771 --> 01:18:19,602
- Yeah. It's him.

1381
01:18:19,652 --> 01:18:21,940
Rick said you look like a hawk.

1382
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:24,882
- Damn, so you're Rick's new delivery men?

1383
01:18:24,932 --> 01:18:27,629
- I ain't nobody's nothing.

1384
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:29,266
- How come Rick didn't come himself?

1385
01:18:29,316 --> 01:18:30,968
- None of your fucking business.

1386
01:18:31,018 --> 01:18:33,685
- Hey, baby. I ain't mad at you.

1387
01:18:35,439 --> 01:18:38,272
All right, let's do some business.

1388
01:18:41,393 --> 01:18:44,393
(suspenseful music)

1389
01:18:51,535 --> 01:18:53,042
- Rick says you just got out.

1390
01:18:53,092 --> 01:18:56,226
- That's right, baby. Is
everything here I asked for?

1391
01:18:56,276 --> 01:18:58,877
- You got first secure
9100 with a code blocker

1392
01:18:58,927 --> 01:19:00,936
and auto override.

1393
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:04,903
VG clamps, B meter, cold
sale, two burn sticks.

1394
01:19:07,983 --> 01:19:11,733
- Yeah. Rick's the best
outfitter in the west.

1395
01:19:11,783 --> 01:19:14,696
And you two look well equipped.

1396
01:19:14,746 --> 01:19:17,163
- You have no idea, Hawk man.

1397
01:19:20,484 --> 01:19:23,401
- You tell Rick everything is cool.

1398
01:19:25,684 --> 01:19:27,517
Wish I had time, baby.

1399
01:19:30,986 --> 01:19:32,572
- Come on, girl. Let's go.

1400
01:19:32,622 --> 01:19:35,372
(sinister music)

1401
01:19:55,487 --> 01:19:58,237
- I'm very sorry about your loss.

1402
01:20:01,066 --> 01:20:04,434
- And you know who has done this?

1403
01:20:04,484 --> 01:20:05,401
- Yes I do.

1404
01:20:06,746 --> 01:20:10,829
- I'm simple man, Mr.
Kirkman, from simple place.

1405
01:20:14,746 --> 01:20:19,746
All the time on the plane, I
am thinking parties unknown.

1406
01:20:19,803 --> 01:20:23,386
I cannot accept that.
Now I have the truth.

1407
01:20:24,843 --> 01:20:27,010
It is not parties unknown.

1408
01:20:28,623 --> 01:20:30,877
- No, sir. It is not.

1409
01:20:30,927 --> 01:20:35,427
- And now. I see in you a
young man filled with anger.

1410
01:20:38,026 --> 01:20:41,609
And this anger will be
satisfied with what?

1411
01:20:43,823 --> 01:20:45,906
- What I need is justice.

1412
01:20:48,004 --> 01:20:51,671
- My anger will fade
with time and grieving.

1413
01:20:56,943 --> 01:21:00,360
Yours, I think, will need something more.

1414
01:21:01,662 --> 01:21:05,437
Now I would like to be
alone with Carolina.

1415
01:21:05,487 --> 01:21:07,946
We have much to talk about.

1416
01:21:07,996 --> 01:21:10,579
(somber music)

1417
01:21:43,281 --> 01:21:46,114
- Your password has been violated?

1418
01:21:49,281 --> 01:21:51,614
Oh my God, Smith, oh my God.

1419
01:21:54,628 --> 01:21:57,378
(sinister music)

1420
01:22:09,841 --> 01:22:12,263
- Hey man, hey. Hey, the money.

1421
01:22:12,313 --> 01:22:15,063
(sinister music)

1422
01:22:23,014 --> 01:22:27,727
- You got a nasty habit of
sneaking up on people, Joe.

1423
01:22:27,777 --> 01:22:28,741
- Probably the only person in the world

1424
01:22:28,791 --> 01:22:29,727
who could sneak up on you.

1425
01:22:29,777 --> 01:22:30,741
- That's cool.

1426
01:22:30,791 --> 01:22:31,747
- Last time I saw you, brother,

1427
01:22:31,797 --> 01:22:33,108
was through the glass at Marion, you know.

1428
01:22:33,158 --> 01:22:34,388
- Things change.

1429
01:22:34,438 --> 01:22:37,087
- Hey, Martin's back at
my place, waiting for you.

1430
01:22:37,137 --> 01:22:42,021
- Is that right? Hey Joe,
I'm sorry to hear about Cray.

1431
01:22:42,071 --> 01:22:43,668
She was a nice lady.

1432
01:22:43,718 --> 01:22:45,647
- Yeah, she was.

1433
01:22:45,697 --> 01:22:48,447
Listen, Chicklets, we're
gonna skin us a rattlesnake.

1434
01:22:48,497 --> 01:22:51,487
- Look, rattlesnakes are
known to have a nasty bite.

1435
01:22:51,537 --> 01:22:54,564
- That's exactly why we called you.

1436
01:22:54,614 --> 01:22:57,807
- Let me go up and change. I'll
meet you back at your crib.

1437
01:22:57,857 --> 01:23:00,607
(doorbell rings)

1438
01:23:06,051 --> 01:23:08,026
- Chicklets, my man.

1439
01:23:08,076 --> 01:23:10,245
Oh, Patrice, I was expecting someone else.

1440
01:23:10,295 --> 01:23:11,967
Listen. I'm sorry about your friend.

1441
01:23:12,017 --> 01:23:13,573
- Where's Joseph?

1442
01:23:13,623 --> 01:23:15,837
- I don't know, but I got a bad feeling.

1443
01:23:15,887 --> 01:23:17,639
Markham's having a dinner party tonight

1444
01:23:17,689 --> 01:23:18,655
over at the Ritz for his business cronies.

1445
01:23:18,705 --> 01:23:21,038
I think Joe went after them.

1446
01:23:22,365 --> 01:23:24,038
Hey, Patrice!

1447
01:23:24,088 --> 01:23:26,838
(sinister music)

1448
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:38,024
- Now my friends, I
have some positive plans

1449
01:23:38,074 --> 01:23:39,923
for Plaxcom's future,

1450
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:42,632
especially among the medical community.

1451
01:23:42,682 --> 01:23:45,272
But first I have to tell you
that this was a banner year

1452
01:23:45,322 --> 01:23:47,992
for Plaxcom and you're
all going to be very happy

1453
01:23:48,042 --> 01:23:50,792
with your Christmas bonuses.

1454
01:23:50,842 --> 01:23:53,950
Now let me tell you what
we have been up to lately.

1455
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,448
- I'll tell you what
he's been up to lately.

1456
01:23:55,498 --> 01:23:57,091
He's been killing innocent women,

1457
01:23:57,141 --> 01:23:59,571
trying to cover up his
crooked business dealings.

1458
01:23:59,621 --> 01:24:01,768
- Who is this crazy lady?

1459
01:24:01,818 --> 01:24:03,848
- You know who I am, you animal.

1460
01:24:03,898 --> 01:24:07,487
You killed Linda Cray and my
friend, Carolyn Thomasson.

1461
01:24:07,537 --> 01:24:10,287
And your assassin was John Smith.

1462
01:24:11,301 --> 01:24:13,971
- You fuck with her, it'll be
the last check you ever cash.

1463
01:24:14,021 --> 01:24:15,550
- I should've known.

1464
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,688
I'm going to have your guts for garbage.

1465
01:24:17,738 --> 01:24:18,712
Get them out of here.

1466
01:24:18,762 --> 01:24:22,030
You take them out of
here and call the police.

1467
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,710
Come on. Let's have a party.

1468
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:27,112
Everybody, drink up and
be merry, like before.

1469
01:24:27,162 --> 01:24:29,528
Great, for Plaxcom.

1470
01:24:29,578 --> 01:24:31,848
Where the fuck have you been?

1471
01:24:31,898 --> 01:24:33,630
- I had to clean something up.

1472
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:36,867
They're out, Ward posted bail.

1473
01:24:36,917 --> 01:24:38,547
- Get rid of them, all of 'em.

1474
01:24:38,597 --> 01:24:42,611
Take 'em out somewhere and
turn 'em into fertilizer now.

1475
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:43,494
- Done.

1476
01:24:46,501 --> 01:24:49,251
(sinister music)

1477
01:24:51,301 --> 01:24:53,475
(Patrice screams)

1478
01:24:53,525 --> 01:24:55,694
- It's okay, honey. This is Chicklets.

1479
01:24:55,744 --> 01:24:58,911
- Nobody was here. So I let myself in.

1480
01:25:00,403 --> 01:25:03,555
(quirky music)

1481
01:25:03,605 --> 01:25:05,272
- That's cool, brother.
You know I understand.

1482
01:25:05,322 --> 01:25:07,313
Listen, I think it's time that
you got this thing started.

1483
01:25:07,363 --> 01:25:09,092
- We gotta go.
- We got trouble.

1484
01:25:09,142 --> 01:25:10,935
That system at Plaxcom
is state of the art.

1485
01:25:10,985 --> 01:25:11,976
And you've been out of touch.

1486
01:25:12,026 --> 01:25:13,795
- I keep up.
- Keep up how?

1487
01:25:13,845 --> 01:25:14,878
You been in the joint.

1488
01:25:14,928 --> 01:25:17,555
- What do you think they
have prison libraries for?

1489
01:25:17,605 --> 01:25:20,094
That's why I liked the federal joints.

1490
01:25:20,144 --> 01:25:21,198
They got everything there

1491
01:25:21,248 --> 01:25:23,875
a guy in my profession
needs to keep up to date.

1492
01:25:23,925 --> 01:25:25,715
You think they incarcerated
me just to let me out

1493
01:25:25,765 --> 01:25:27,348
to work at Wendy's?

1494
01:25:28,266 --> 01:25:30,531
- Jesus.
- Yeah, Jesus.

1495
01:25:30,581 --> 01:25:33,133
He was in the joint,
but we didn't hang out.

1496
01:25:33,183 --> 01:25:34,850
I was busy studying.

1497
01:25:35,904 --> 01:25:37,950
- I saw that damn black
van outside of jail.

1498
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,106
When you bailed us out.

1499
01:25:39,156 --> 01:25:40,958
- [Bobby] A black van
with painted windows?

1500
01:25:41,008 --> 01:25:41,841
- Yeah.

1501
01:25:43,064 --> 01:25:45,059
- You brought home company, baby.

1502
01:25:45,109 --> 01:25:46,238
- Shit.

1503
01:25:46,288 --> 01:25:48,035
- What the hell is
that? Hey wait a minute.

1504
01:25:48,085 --> 01:25:49,576
Your record never mentioned guns.

1505
01:25:49,626 --> 01:25:50,856
(gun cocks)

1506
01:25:50,906 --> 01:25:53,875
- Systems change, times change.

1507
01:25:53,925 --> 01:25:55,635
- What is going on?

1508
01:25:55,685 --> 01:25:58,793
- We're going to break
into Markham's office.

1509
01:25:58,843 --> 01:26:01,795
- You think there's material
there that could expose him?

1510
01:26:01,845 --> 01:26:03,635
- For God's sake, Joe, leave
her out of this, will you?

1511
01:26:03,685 --> 01:26:06,456
- Martin, I trust her completely.

1512
01:26:06,506 --> 01:26:07,654
If there's records,

1513
01:26:07,704 --> 01:26:09,235
there's a good chance
they're at his office.

1514
01:26:09,285 --> 01:26:11,535
- A Chippy, we got complications.

1515
01:26:13,042 --> 01:26:14,819
- Who are you?

1516
01:26:14,869 --> 01:26:18,033
- Robert Adam Chicklet, sister,

1517
01:26:18,083 --> 01:26:20,259
pleased to make your acquaintance.

1518
01:26:20,309 --> 01:26:23,416
- I assume you are the
skill part of this outing.

1519
01:26:23,466 --> 01:26:25,696
Burglar, generic thief?

1520
01:26:25,746 --> 01:26:28,133
- No, Patrice, Chicklets is the best.

1521
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:32,273
- A brainy chick. Man, we
got even more problems.

1522
01:26:32,323 --> 01:26:34,813
- And you are a hacker as well?

1523
01:26:34,863 --> 01:26:36,113
- I specialize.

1524
01:26:37,183 --> 01:26:39,731
- I'll take that as a no.

1525
01:26:39,781 --> 01:26:43,793
Did Joe tell you that I have a
master's in computer science?

1526
01:26:43,843 --> 01:26:45,555
- [Joe] No, Patrice, not after that.

1527
01:26:45,605 --> 01:26:48,628
- After what? He murdered
Carol and he murdered Linda.

1528
01:26:48,678 --> 01:26:50,253
- Listen, you're not going.

1529
01:26:50,303 --> 01:26:52,392
- Try and stop me.

1530
01:26:52,442 --> 01:26:54,962
- Guys. Give me a minute,
I need to speak to her.

1531
01:26:55,012 --> 01:26:56,929
Come over here, please.

1532
01:26:57,873 --> 01:26:58,863
What is wrong with you?

1533
01:26:58,913 --> 01:27:00,842
- I'm not in the mood for a lecture, Joe.

1534
01:27:00,892 --> 01:27:03,940
- Have I done that?
- No, but you're about to.

1535
01:27:03,990 --> 01:27:05,263
- Things have gotten out of hand.

1536
01:27:05,313 --> 01:27:07,583
- I've realize that.

1537
01:27:07,633 --> 01:27:09,685
- All I ask you to do is
stay here where it's safe.

1538
01:27:09,735 --> 01:27:12,762
Let me do what I have to do.

1539
01:27:12,812 --> 01:27:14,300
- Where is safe, Joe?

1540
01:27:14,350 --> 01:27:18,317
In a world where Markham and
his thugs exist, where is safe?

1541
01:27:18,367 --> 01:27:21,138
Is love safe? I don't think so.

1542
01:27:21,188 --> 01:27:23,001
- I'm not talking about love.

1543
01:27:23,051 --> 01:27:25,397
I'm talking about breaking
into Markham's office.

1544
01:27:25,447 --> 01:27:28,719
- Then don't do it. Do
what I told you before.

1545
01:27:28,769 --> 01:27:30,762
Just give it to the authorities
and let them handle Markham

1546
01:27:30,812 --> 01:27:32,202
the way they handle these things.

1547
01:27:32,252 --> 01:27:35,180
But no, you won't do that.

1548
01:27:35,230 --> 01:27:39,620
- I have to avenge Linda
and Carolyn's death.

1549
01:27:39,670 --> 01:27:42,020
I know that may be wrong or twisted

1550
01:27:42,070 --> 01:27:44,239
or tinged with a bit of evil itself.

1551
01:27:44,289 --> 01:27:45,289
But it's me.

1552
01:27:49,745 --> 01:27:52,912
- Well, if it's you, then it's me too.

1553
01:27:53,969 --> 01:27:55,919
We've been through too much together

1554
01:27:55,969 --> 01:27:57,886
for it to be you and I.

1555
01:27:58,748 --> 01:28:01,498
It's either us or.
- You're right. Your right

1556
01:28:06,077 --> 01:28:09,754
Guys, she's in. She knows computers.

1557
01:28:09,804 --> 01:28:11,136
She can help us down there.

1558
01:28:11,186 --> 01:28:12,834
- What about the van?

1559
01:28:12,884 --> 01:28:17,051
- Okay, look, you handle
her. I'll handle the van.

1560
01:28:19,206 --> 01:28:21,956
(exciting music)

1561
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:19,476
- Shit, fuck, we lost him.

1562
01:29:19,526 --> 01:29:20,879
How in the hell are we
supposed to do them tonight

1563
01:29:20,929 --> 01:29:23,679
if we can't find them, son of a bitch.

1564
01:29:23,729 --> 01:29:26,580
We're never going to find them.

1565
01:29:26,630 --> 01:29:28,180
- What's wrong with this picture?

1566
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:30,980
(sinister music)

1567
01:29:33,004 --> 01:29:34,337
- Hey, you okay?

1568
01:29:35,486 --> 01:29:36,736
- Can I be now?

1569
01:29:38,886 --> 01:29:40,053
- I guess not.

1570
01:29:46,625 --> 01:29:47,632
(door clicks)

1571
01:29:47,682 --> 01:29:48,515
- Yeah.

1572
01:29:51,708 --> 01:29:53,839
- Brother, you still
got the touch. Good job.

1573
01:29:53,889 --> 01:29:55,293
- Hey, what about lobby guards?

1574
01:29:55,343 --> 01:29:56,698
Shouldn't they be making rounds?

1575
01:29:56,748 --> 01:30:00,581
- Hey, good point. In
case we get interrupted.

1576
01:30:02,864 --> 01:30:05,031
I'll holler when I get in.

1577
01:30:08,705 --> 01:30:11,288
(somber music)

1578
01:30:23,464 --> 01:30:25,839
- Hurry up, Chicklets, we
don't have much time, man.

1579
01:30:25,889 --> 01:30:28,556
(somber music)

1580
01:30:28,606 --> 01:30:29,556
Oh, shit.

1581
01:30:29,606 --> 01:30:32,356
(sinister music)

1582
01:31:36,426 --> 01:31:38,053
- Okay, brainy lady.

1583
01:31:38,103 --> 01:31:40,500
Welcome to the world
wide web superhighway.

1584
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:42,298
The computer is all yours.

1585
01:31:42,348 --> 01:31:44,134
- Did you ever think of
writing a book, Mr. Chickle?

1586
01:31:44,184 --> 01:31:45,697
Because you have very colorful phrasing.

1587
01:31:45,747 --> 01:31:48,580
- Not now, guys, not now, come on.

1588
01:31:53,212 --> 01:31:57,045
- If we get interrupted,
act like you mean it.

1589
01:31:59,532 --> 01:32:00,865
Let's do the do.

1590
01:32:10,268 --> 01:32:13,018
(sinister music)

1591
01:32:17,646 --> 01:32:20,979
- Ain't that the broad's car? You think?

1592
01:32:22,028 --> 01:32:23,536
- You don't?

1593
01:32:23,586 --> 01:32:26,336
(sinister music)

1594
01:33:03,308 --> 01:33:06,441
- Got the safe.
- Good job, man.

1595
01:33:06,491 --> 01:33:08,491
Let's get it open.

1596
01:33:10,070 --> 01:33:12,403
Anything yet?
- No, not yet.

1597
01:33:14,028 --> 01:33:18,037
- You know I'm proud of you, don't you?

1598
01:33:18,087 --> 01:33:21,220
- Aren't you supposed
to be watching the door?

1599
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:22,103
- Yeah.

1600
01:33:38,188 --> 01:33:39,355
- Gin, I'm in.

1601
01:33:47,372 --> 01:33:49,418
Bunch of junk, but you
can tell your editor

1602
01:33:49,468 --> 01:33:50,938
that I've been paid.

1603
01:33:50,988 --> 01:33:55,988
(sinister music)
(silenced guns fire)

1604
01:33:57,612 --> 01:33:58,445
- Joe!

1605
01:34:02,662 --> 01:34:07,579
- That's it. Numbers, dates,
records, the whole damn thing.

1606
01:34:08,936 --> 01:34:12,069
Get that on this disc and
get the hell out of here.

1607
01:34:12,119 --> 01:34:15,119
(suspenseful music)

1608
01:34:22,443 --> 01:34:25,429
(Patrice screams)

1609
01:34:25,479 --> 01:34:28,479
- Fucking amateur. Put the gun down.

1610
01:34:33,483 --> 01:34:35,411
- Come on. Let's do them right here.

1611
01:34:35,461 --> 01:34:37,449
- No, Markham likes it nice and neat.

1612
01:34:37,499 --> 01:34:39,470
- What about this sack of shit?

1613
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:42,131
- Let the burglar explain it all.

1614
01:34:42,181 --> 01:34:45,070
Okay, everybody. I don't feel
like carrying bodies tonight.

1615
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:48,809
We're going to take a little
walk. Boyd, get the girl.

1616
01:34:48,859 --> 01:34:50,609
Hey. Come on, get up.

1617
01:34:51,699 --> 01:34:52,532
Let's go.

1618
01:34:58,059 --> 01:35:02,089
Hey bitch, your roommate
makes great fish bait.

1619
01:35:02,139 --> 01:35:04,777
(sinister music)

1620
01:35:04,827 --> 01:35:07,230
- You bitch.
- Patrice, get the disc!

1621
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:10,030
(sinister music)

1622
01:35:11,942 --> 01:35:15,025
(silenced gun fires)

1623
01:35:20,379 --> 01:35:23,092
(glass shatters)

1624
01:35:23,142 --> 01:35:25,475
(men grunt)

1625
01:35:33,798 --> 01:35:34,852
- Joe?

1626
01:35:34,902 --> 01:35:36,528
- You guys okay? Where's the disc?

1627
01:35:36,578 --> 01:35:37,828
- I got it.

1628
01:35:37,878 --> 01:35:39,268
Hey, you're bleeding all over.

1629
01:35:39,318 --> 01:35:40,101
- Don't worry about that. I'm okay.

1630
01:35:40,151 --> 01:35:41,972
- Now we have to call the police.

1631
01:35:42,022 --> 01:35:43,055
- And tell them what?

1632
01:35:43,105 --> 01:35:45,295
That we broke in and stole
evidence of conspiracy?

1633
01:35:45,345 --> 01:35:46,313
Bad idea.

1634
01:35:46,363 --> 01:35:48,271
We get on the horses and
you do what you gotta do.

1635
01:35:48,321 --> 01:35:49,273
- What about him?

1636
01:35:49,323 --> 01:35:51,033
- Let him explain how he
got here and got shot.

1637
01:35:51,083 --> 01:35:52,452
By that time, if you know your business

1638
01:35:52,502 --> 01:35:54,835
the package will be wrapped.

1639
01:35:56,472 --> 01:36:00,305
- Patrice is right. You
are colorful, brother.

1640
01:36:01,276 --> 01:36:03,693
(men mutter)

1641
01:36:07,462 --> 01:36:09,188
- Step back from the car, please.

1642
01:36:09,238 --> 01:36:10,644
- Step back from the vehicle, please.

1643
01:36:10,694 --> 01:36:15,611
(men mutter)
(eerie music)

1644
01:36:31,542 --> 01:36:34,290
- Mr. Markham. I'm Detective Cogan.

1645
01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:39,193
This is Detective Hail. I have
a warrant for your arrest.

1646
01:36:39,243 --> 01:36:40,596
Sir, stop right there.
- Where is security?

1647
01:36:40,646 --> 01:36:42,036
- Stop right there.
- Where is my security?

1648
01:36:42,086 --> 01:36:44,972
- Stop right there, turn around.

1649
01:36:45,022 --> 01:36:48,073
- What the hell am I being arrested for?

1650
01:36:48,123 --> 01:36:50,772
- How about two counts of murder.

1651
01:36:50,822 --> 01:36:52,771
One count of conspiracy.

1652
01:36:52,821 --> 01:36:56,676
And one count of illegal
trafficking. Come on.

1653
01:36:56,726 --> 01:36:57,673
- And Ms. Allen, you need to come down

1654
01:36:57,723 --> 01:36:59,412
to the station for questioning.

1655
01:36:59,462 --> 01:37:01,476
Walk with me, please.

1656
01:37:01,526 --> 01:37:02,852
(sinister music)

1657
01:37:02,902 --> 01:37:04,193
- Mr. Markham, what about Plaxcom?

1658
01:37:04,243 --> 01:37:07,111
- Mr. Markham, your comments please, sir.

1659
01:37:07,161 --> 01:37:08,313
- Mr. Markham, would you like

1660
01:37:08,363 --> 01:37:10,612
to make a comment at this time?

1661
01:37:10,662 --> 01:37:12,630
- You think it's over, reporter?

1662
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:17,392
You haven't seen hell yet,
but I'm gonna show it to you.

1663
01:37:17,442 --> 01:37:21,636
- I won't be hard to find.
- Neither will I.

1664
01:37:21,686 --> 01:37:25,103
- I'll be looking for you too.
- Let's go.

1665
01:37:26,481 --> 01:37:30,231
- Two decent human beings
died, and for what?

1666
01:37:32,182 --> 01:37:34,351
- You were right when
you left the paper, Joe.

1667
01:37:34,401 --> 01:37:37,151
The real stories are the closeup ones.

1668
01:37:37,201 --> 01:37:39,529
But now I want you to come
back and work for me again.

1669
01:37:39,579 --> 01:37:41,892
Not writing about scum like Markham,

1670
01:37:41,942 --> 01:37:45,055
but writing about Linda and Carolyn.

1671
01:37:45,105 --> 01:37:46,713
I want you to tell the
world that no good life

1672
01:37:46,763 --> 01:37:48,335
is worth the story.

1673
01:37:48,385 --> 01:37:50,718
- Hear, hear. Thanks Martin.

1674
01:37:53,462 --> 01:37:55,571
Give me some time to
think about that, though.

1675
01:37:55,621 --> 01:37:58,621
- Take all the time you need, buddy.

1676
01:38:00,811 --> 01:38:03,728
- My friend, I owe you another one.

1677
01:38:05,163 --> 01:38:08,713
- You call me to testify
and I ain't going to show up

1678
01:38:08,763 --> 01:38:10,751
and then we'll be even.

1679
01:38:10,801 --> 01:38:12,532
- I thought we were supposed
to putting the bad guys away.

1680
01:38:12,582 --> 01:38:14,415
Not ourselves.

1681
01:38:14,465 --> 01:38:17,652
- Hey look guys, let me
know if you need anything

1682
01:38:17,702 --> 01:38:19,012
for the wedding.

1683
01:38:19,062 --> 01:38:21,812
(romantic music)

1684
01:38:26,518 --> 01:38:29,018
- May I please have your hand?

1685
01:38:34,261 --> 01:38:38,594
This belonged to my mom.
But now it's meant for you.

1686
01:38:41,806 --> 01:38:44,473
Will you please do me the honor?

1687
01:38:46,682 --> 01:38:48,156
- It's beautiful, Joe.

1688
01:38:48,206 --> 01:38:50,956
(romantic music)

1689
01:38:57,923 --> 01:39:00,256
And this belonged to my dad.

1690
01:39:04,286 --> 01:39:06,669
I want you to have it.

1691
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:08,935
(Joe and Bobby hum "Wedding March")

1692
01:39:08,985 --> 01:39:12,985
- This calls for a toast.
Hey waiter, champagne.

1693
01:39:19,246 --> 01:39:21,829
(somber music)

1694
01:40:02,462 --> 01:40:07,379
- I see you got your annual
birthday card from Mrs. Antasio.

1695
01:40:08,362 --> 01:40:09,311
You're never gonna tell me

1696
01:40:09,361 --> 01:40:13,111
who this secret admirer
of yours is, are you?

1697
01:40:14,102 --> 01:40:16,817
- Been telling you for 12 years.

1698
01:40:16,867 --> 01:40:18,673
She's just someone who
decided to take responsibility

1699
01:40:18,723 --> 01:40:21,617
for her own circumstances.

1700
01:40:21,667 --> 01:40:24,113
Still living in that same building.

1701
01:40:24,163 --> 01:40:27,335
- Excuse me. What was
that, husband of mine?

1702
01:40:27,385 --> 01:40:28,552
- Oh, nothing.

1703
01:40:30,286 --> 01:40:32,316
- You know what, let's teach
dad how to do that dance.

1704
01:40:32,366 --> 01:40:34,116
I know I never could.

1705
01:40:34,963 --> 01:40:37,796
(romantic music)
