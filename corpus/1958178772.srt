1
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,372
Couldn't look you in the eye

2
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:09,505
You're just like an angel

3
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,635
Your skin makes me cry

4
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:37,157
Come on, Drax. Dance.

5
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,700
Only idiots dance.

6
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,962
I'm a weirdo

7
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:12,693
I want to have control

8
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:20,325
I want a perfect body

9
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:53,609
Hey!

10
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:59,031
I told you a million times...

11
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,284
you keep your grimy raccoon hands
off my Zune.

12
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:08,373
I told you a million times,
I'm not a damn raccoon.

13
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,811
Again?

14
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,097
I love you, Gamora.

15
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,767
So, what are you gonna do about Quill?

16
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,728
Me? Why not you?

17
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,939
I got emotionalistical issues.
What am I gonna do?

18
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,357
Why are you on the ceiling?

19
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,402
I wanted to see if these new gravity boots
worked on a slope.

20
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,618
Here we go.

21
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:23,759
Sorry.

22
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,684
Bozhe moi, Kraglin.

23
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,436
You must know you will never learn.

24
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,146
You think you could do better?

25
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,878
Telekinesis is cheating!

26
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,964
That's a stupid little pebble!

27
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,049
I could do that with my dang finger!

28
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:05,884
You're a bad dog.

29
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,637
Do not say that to me.

30
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,347
You are. You're a bad dog.

31
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:11,890
Take that back.

32
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,308
Come on, that's not cool.

33
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,602
Nebula, did you hear?

34
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,730
He called me a bad dog,
and he refused to take it back.

35
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,399
I don't care, Cosmo.

36
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:22,484
-Is Peter okay?
-I don't know.

37
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:23,485
What are you going to do?

38
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,863
Me? He's your brother.

39
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:28,115
It doesn't matter,
he still doesn't listen to me.

40
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,951
Yeah, he has been pretty mopey
ever since Gamora died.

41
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,369
She's not dead.

42
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:35,080
She just doesn't remember anything
from the past few years.

43
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,540
Nobody tells me nothing.

44
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:39,877
Mantis, why don't you just touch him
and, you know, make him happy?

45
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:40,836
I am Groot?

46
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:41,879
-Dude!
-Gross!

47
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,882
No, not like that.
Touch him with her powers.

48
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:47,426
It is wrong to manipulate
the feelings of friends.

49
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:49,720
'Bout that time
you made me fall in love with my sock?

50
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,263
Well, that was funny.

51
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,807
I guess it's back to one of us
touching him the other way.

52
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,100
Maybe we should draw straws.

53
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,102
No one ever meant that, Drax.

54
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:56,662
-What was that?
-What was that?

55
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:57,829
What the hell?

56
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:58,997
Oh, my God!

57
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,165
Is he okay?

58
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:10,259
Hey!

59
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,053
Where did you go, squirrel?

60
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,062
On the ground!

61
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,501
No, stop! Don't!

62
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,088
Stop, please! No! Stop, please!

63
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,214
Please!

64
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,999
Who is that maniac?

65
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:28,003
Some super douche with ray gun hands,
I don't frickin' know.

66
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:06,792
Who threw this thing at me?

67
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:08,460
Shut up.

68
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,171
Baby.

69
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,856
Pick on someone your own size.

70
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:56,341
Peter!

71
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,594
Peter!

72
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,095
We need Med-Paks!

73
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:15,777
Nebula!

74
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:16,945
Piss off.

75
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:43,013
Rocket.

76
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,326
That hurts.

77
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:06,411
What a pity.

78
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:24,388
No!

79
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,893
All I did was activate the Med-Paks!

80
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,562
Get them off! Now!

81
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:16,356
Oh, hell.

82
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:18,233
We need to get him to the Med-Bay!

83
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,277
It was destroyed. There's one on the ship.

84
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,285
Lill ol od for today.

85
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,165
Stitch him up and transfer him in
with the rest of Batch 89.

86
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:06,490
It's okay.

87
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,492
You're here with us now.

88
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:11,954
Hey! It's a new guy.

89
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,705
What kind of thing are you?

90
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,583
You've got, like, a mask on your face.

91
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:22,464
Mask, eyes, face, mouth...

92
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:24,258
does it words?

93
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:29,054
It's okay, friend.
Don't let them scare you.

94
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:36,103
Hurts.

95
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:01,628
It's okay.

96
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:06,258
You're gonna be okay.

97
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,512
A kill switch?

98
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:14,641
A device set to destruct
if anyone goes poking around inside him...

99
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,018
or even if we use the Med-Paks.

100
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:17,895
And why would Rocket have a kill switch?

101
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,272
Apparently, someone considers him
proprietary technology...

102
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:22,691
and sent that golden lunatic to get him.

103
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,401
So, he'll die if we operate on him?

104
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:25,402
And he'll die if we don't.

105
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:26,778
There has to be some way to bypass it.

106
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:29,531
It looks like there's a passkey
that could override the kill switch.

107
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:31,950
What do we know
about where Rocket came from?

108
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:33,035
He won't talk about it.

109
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:35,704
Much of the tech was developed
by a company called OrgoCorp.

110
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,915
And there's a code on all of it...

111
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,667
89P13.

112
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,711
He's got maybe 48 hours.

113
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:46,423
Where are you going?

114
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:47,925
OrgoCorp have to have records, right?

115
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:51,178
Maybe they'll have a way for us to
override the kill switch and save Rocket.

116
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:52,638
They won't just give us that information.

117
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,223
Well, that's why we're gonna break in.

118
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,308
We kill anyone who gets in our way!

119
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,018
-Not kill anyone.
-Kill a few people.

120
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,061
Kill no people.

121
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:01,772
Kill one guy,
one stupid guy who no one loves.

122
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,649
Now you're just making it sad.

123
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:11,031
Kraglin, Cosmo,
I need you to keep watch...

124
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:12,783
over Knowhere till we're back.
Couple of days, tops.

125
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,409
-Aye, Cap'n.
-Aye, comrade.

126
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,247
Take back what you said,
that I'm a bad dog.

127
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:19,289
Nope.

128
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,542
I know you don't really think
I am a bad dog.

129
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:22,668
Can you please take it back?

130
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:23,794
I will not.

131
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:27,798
I located the coordinates for OrgoCorp.

132
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:30,592
I think I have a contact near there.
Maybe they can help us get in.

133
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:31,552
Contact him.

134
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,429
Let's go save our friend.

135
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,847
No, no, no.

136
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:39,494
It's good to have friends.

137
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:49,379
Oh, my poor baby.

138
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:51,840
It hurts.

139
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,676
Do you have it?

140
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:55,844
He does not, sire.

141
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:58,805
I tried to warn you, High Evolutionary.

142
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:01,350
These Guardians are more powerful
than you think.

143
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:06,146
Or perhaps you simply overestimate
your own value, High Priestess.

144
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:09,858
No doubt a flaw of some type
in my own design.

145
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,819
I created you lot as merely
an aesthetic experiment.

146
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,863
Beautiful numbskulls.

147
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:18,075
But your egos have run wild. Say, "Ah."

148
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:22,162
And this one
was meant to be the Warlock...

149
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,747
the apogee of their people.

150
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:26,250
You removed Adam from his cocoon early...

151
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,543
my liege.

152
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:29,044
He's still a child.

153
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:31,922
No, there's something wrong with him
even outside all that.

154
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:33,674
Yes, there's something wrong with me!

155
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:36,009
I was stabbed, you extraordinary phallus!

156
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,597
He doesn't know any better.
We shall do whatever you require, my liege.

157
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:44,226
You knew of 89P13's existence for years
without alerting me.

158
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:46,311
That's not what I require!

159
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,275
I'm sorry, my liege.

160
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:54,486
Find 89P13 and return it to me...

161
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:59,616
or I will destroy your entire civilization,
as is my right as your maker.

162
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:01,577
Do you understand?

163
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,709
Do you understand?

164
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:11,253
Yes, sire.

165
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:13,755
Toodle-do.

166
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:19,094
How did 89P13 survive
after all these years, Theel?

167
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:21,054
It was always clever, sire.

168
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,432
-Yes, that's exactly why I want it now.
-Of course.

169
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:26,268
-Its brain.
-That is the only reason, sire.

170
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:30,606
But are you really trusting the Sovereign
to retrieve it?

171
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:34,359
They're merely a backup.
I believe I know where they're going.

172
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:09,895
It's bio-formed.

173
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:12,606
Instead of being built,
it's grown from living matter.

174
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:17,110
The structure is surrounded by three
impenetrable plasmic security shields.

175
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:19,613
It's not going to be easy
to break into this place, Star-Lord.

176
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:22,658
Doesn't have to be easy.
I was a professional thief, remember?

177
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:24,284
I'll jam the signals one at a time.

178
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:28,121
She calls me Star-Lord
when she's mad at me.

179
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:29,540
She's always mad...

180
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:30,916
at everyone.

181
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:34,169
It's because I was drunk.

182
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,506
She's right.

183
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:38,799
If I hadn't been drinking...

184
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:41,802
maybe Rocket... I'm sorry.

185
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,304
It's okay. He's your best friend.

186
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:45,764
Second best friend.

187
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:50,686
Everyone around me dies.
My mother, Yondu, Gamora.

188
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:51,770
Gamora isn't dead.

189
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:53,981
She is to us.
You want a Zarg-Nut?

190
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,191
Thank you.

191
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:01,905
First shield set.

192
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:05,242
Three, two...

193
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:08,078
one.

194
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:14,793
-Peter.
-What?

195
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:16,920
You had family on Earth...

196
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:19,006
and you never wanted
to go back to see them?

197
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:22,843
No, you're my sister.
That's all the family I want or need.

198
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:26,471
Besides, it was really just my grandpa, okay?
He was a pretty hard guy.

199
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:28,473
Still. Don't you think he...

200
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:30,225
What?

201
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:33,896
You were abducted by Ravagers
the same day he lost his daughter.

202
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:35,522
Oh, yeah, he was upset.

203
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:37,983
My mom died, he screamed in my face,
he pushed me out of the room!

204
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:40,485
He was probably
just trying to protect you.

205
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:42,196
-What are you talking about?
-What?

206
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:44,698
I'm talking about the people in my life
who died, and you're talking about this?

207
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:45,699
Second shield set.

208
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:47,367
Three, two...

209
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:48,619
one.

210
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:54,625
I'm only saying...

211
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,085
you've never even gone
to see if he's okay.

212
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:58,629
He could still be alive.

213
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:02,508
My grandpa, he'd be, like,
90-something years old.

214
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:04,009
So he could still be alive.

215
00:23:04,176 --> 00:23:05,969
People on Earth die when they're, like, 50.

216
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:07,804
They die when they're 50?

217
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:09,556
I don't know. Something like that.

218
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,266
What's even the point of being born?

219
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:12,434
Exactly!

220
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:14,186
Are you about to die?

221
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:17,189
I'm not 50!

222
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,400
The point is...

223
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,736
I wasn't talking about any of this.

224
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,697
Third shield set.

225
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:28,742
Three, two, one.

226
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:32,412
Well, not everything
is about what you are talking about.

227
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:33,914
And I'm only saying...

228
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:37,668
you are upset because so many of the people
you cared about have left you...

229
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:39,795
but you also left someone.

230
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:42,089
And maybe I wanted a Zarg-Nut!

231
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:44,174
It's too late. They're all gone.

232
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:58,313
Why didn't we go through?

233
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:04,444
We did. It's not the shield.

234
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,033
Oh, hell.

235
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:14,538
Ravagers.

236
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:16,373
Hey, guys...

237
00:24:16,582 --> 00:24:18,917
you're about to be boarded
by the United Ravagers.

238
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:21,920
You can surrender and turn over
any stuff worth anything and live...

239
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:23,630
or you can die.

240
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:25,007
Totes up to you.

241
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:42,733
Drax, no, no, no, Drax!

242
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:44,943
Guys, it's me, Peter Quill,
I'm one of you, remember?

243
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:45,986
Hold on!

244
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:47,070
We have an appointment!

245
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:48,071
We have an appointment.

246
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:48,989
With who?

247
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:51,116
-With Gamora.
-With Gamora.

248
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:52,159
What?

249
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:53,660
You're early.

250
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:11,094
What are these?

251
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:13,680
OrgoCorp uniforms.

252
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,975
You're gonna have to wear these
to move through the Orgo...

253
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,228
without attracting attention.

254
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:20,646
This isn't my color.

255
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:25,317
What did you say?

256
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:27,194
It clashes with my eyes.

257
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:32,950
Put it on!

258
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:38,205
Nebula, why would you not tell me
that you've been in contact with Gamora?

259
00:25:38,372 --> 00:25:39,873
Because I didn't want you to get freaked out.

260
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,041
Freaked out how?

261
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:42,251
Like that.

262
00:25:42,835 --> 00:25:43,836
Let me in there.

263
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:45,587
I don't wanna be trapped out here,
I can't...

264
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:48,048
Gamora, we are grateful for your help.

265
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:50,676
Oh, I'm not doing this
out of the kindness of my heart.

266
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:54,596
I'm doing this for the hundred thousand
units my sister promised.

267
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:57,140
So, you're a Ravager now?

268
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:58,725
Put on the uniform.

269
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:00,561
Never pictured you as the Ravager type.

270
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:03,063
Who are you again?

271
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:04,731
Oh, man.

272
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:08,026
OrgoCorp is in possession
of some of the most advanced...

273
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:10,988
cybergenetic IP in the galaxy...

274
00:26:11,697 --> 00:26:16,034
so they're heavily guarded
by the deadly Orgosentries.

275
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:19,663
Now, I know you don't have
documentation to dock...

276
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:22,040
so you're gonna have to
get in there on your own.

277
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:26,879
Once in, Gamora is gonna
lead you to the records...

278
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:29,173
where maybe you can find the passkey...

279
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:31,675
to override the kill switch...

280
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:33,886
and help you save the hedgehog.

281
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:36,180
But if you get into trouble...

282
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:39,725
we will not be able to bail you out.

283
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:57,993
Yes.

284
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:01,121
Yes, of course. Brilliant.

285
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,751
His functioning has skyrocketed.

286
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:11,006
That's correct, P13.

287
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:12,508
Very good.

288
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:20,140
That's the new world.

289
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:21,683
Counter-Earth.

290
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:24,686
Where the experiments will go
once they're ready.

291
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:26,146
It blue.

292
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:27,314
That's the sky.

293
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:28,815
Sky.

294
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:33,028
Rocket.

295
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:34,738
Yes, it is.

296
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:37,157
What sounds?

297
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:40,244
That's music.

298
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:41,537
We like it?

299
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,121
We do.

300
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:47,209
This recording is over 5,000 years old.

301
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:51,964
"Mo Ergastee Förn, Mo Ergalone Förn Nort."

302
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:54,174
Which, translated, is...

303
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:57,803
"Be not as you are, but as you should be."

304
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,972
It's our sacred mission...

305
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:02,975
to take the cacophony of sounds around us...

306
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:06,186
and turn it into a song.

307
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,482
To take an imperfect clump...

308
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:13,443
of biological matter such as you...

309
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:16,530
and transform it into something...

310
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:18,240
perfect.

311
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:23,745
And we're halfway there, aren't we?

312
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:29,501
Come with me, P13.

313
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:31,712
I'd like to show you something.

314
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:38,010
We have but a single quest...

315
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:40,804
to create the perfect species...

316
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:42,973
and the perfect society.

317
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:45,642
You, P13...

318
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:48,061
are part of Batch 89.

319
00:28:48,187 --> 00:28:50,606
But here with Batch 90...

320
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:54,109
I've developed a process
by which I can guide...

321
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:56,778
any organism through millions of years...

322
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:59,448
of programmed evolutionary changes...

323
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:01,491
in a moment.

324
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:36,235
See, now, there's the rub.

325
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:38,695
For some reason...

326
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:42,032
these specimens are also over-producing...

327
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:45,953
loligo beta-microseminoprotein
in their systems...

328
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,621
causing them to be, well...

329
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:50,040
Violent. We don't like it.

330
00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:53,919
A utopia can't have its denizens
murdering one another, can it?

331
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:55,254
It can'ts.

332
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:57,172
Can't.

333
00:29:57,422 --> 00:29:58,423
Can't.

334
00:29:58,799 --> 00:29:59,800
Theel.

335
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:06,890
They're programmed to be peaceful.
Like you.

336
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:10,352
But for some reason, it's not catching.

337
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:13,146
Hyptonic filters.

338
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:14,314
What?

339
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:18,360
They's suppressaliting
the glycosylated saltses.

340
00:30:18,944 --> 00:30:22,906
And then boop-boop-boop,
halfcystine residual be formin'...

341
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:25,576
and then, they make...

342
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:27,077
What do you say?

343
00:30:27,244 --> 00:30:29,288
Loligo beta-microseminoproteins.

344
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:30,956
Yeah, thems.

345
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:33,750
And then, angry turtleses.

346
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:25,344
There. That's the decompression chamber.

347
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:27,179
Lock in.

348
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:38,398
Go.

349
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:10,389
Activate gravity boots and gloves.

350
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:20,274
Nebula, go.

351
00:32:55,726 --> 00:32:57,686
So, you really don't remember anything?

352
00:32:57,853 --> 00:32:58,854
Like what?

353
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:00,772
'Bout your time with us.

354
00:33:01,815 --> 00:33:02,900
No.

355
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:04,234
We were...

356
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:06,278
We weren't anything.

357
00:33:06,403 --> 00:33:07,446
You and me...

358
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:11,325
That person was
some alternate future version of me.

359
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:13,660
It wasn't me.

360
00:33:15,162 --> 00:33:16,496
We loved each other.

361
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,917
I don't think so.

362
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:23,378
I know you don't remember any of it.

363
00:33:26,465 --> 00:33:28,050
You were everything to me.

364
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:32,304
And I miss you...

365
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:35,140
so much.

366
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:37,518
And, maybe...

367
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:40,979
maybe, if you open yourself up to it...

368
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:43,857
there's a possibility...

369
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:45,609
I don't think so, Quinn.

370
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:47,736
Quill.

371
00:33:47,903 --> 00:33:49,029
Quill.

372
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:52,157
I don't think so.

373
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:53,325
Well, what I'm trying to say...

374
00:33:53,492 --> 00:33:55,619
Peter, you know
this is an open line, right?

375
00:33:55,786 --> 00:33:56,828
What?

376
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:58,539
We're listening
to everything you're saying.

377
00:33:58,622 --> 00:34:00,582
And it is painful.

378
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:01,834
And you're just telling me now?

379
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:03,544
We were hoping it would stop on its own.

380
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,586
But I switched it over to private!

381
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:06,046
What color button did you push?

382
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:07,256
Blue, for the blue suit!

383
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:08,340
Oh, no!

384
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:10,133
Blue is the open line for everyone.

385
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,969
-Orange is for blue.
-What?

386
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:13,220
Black is for orange...

387
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:17,182
yellow is for green, green is for red,
and red is for yellow.

388
00:34:17,307 --> 00:34:18,642
No. Yellow is for yellow...

389
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:20,477
green is for red, red is for green.

390
00:34:20,602 --> 00:34:22,271
-I don't think so.
-Try it then.

391
00:34:23,939 --> 00:34:24,940
Hello!

392
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:28,110
You were right.

393
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:30,070
How the hell am I supposed to
know all of that?

394
00:34:30,237 --> 00:34:31,154
Seems intuitive.

395
00:34:31,947 --> 00:34:33,991
Can we get back to saving our friend?

396
00:34:34,992 --> 00:34:37,452
Get that jammer ready to change the shield.

397
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:12,779
Guys?

398
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:16,909
I mean, you wanna talk about a sweet ride?
The acceleration will crush your spine.

399
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:19,536
It's got that brand-new fusalix core.
You know what I'm talking about?

400
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:20,704
Yeah.

401
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:22,164
Really? 'Cause I just made that up.

402
00:35:23,457 --> 00:35:24,708
I thought you said somethin' else.

403
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:26,793
Master Karja.

404
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:30,422
-No, you didn't.
-I did.

405
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:33,175
Master Karja, there appears to be
a physical breach...

406
00:35:33,342 --> 00:35:34,426
in the white wing somewhere.

407
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:36,136
-Could it be a glitch?
-Maybe.

408
00:35:42,726 --> 00:35:43,852
I'm accessing the eye.

409
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:45,604
I'll see if I can locate it.

410
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:20,347
There's some sort of anomaly
in the decompression chamber.

411
00:36:20,472 --> 00:36:22,182
-Best you check it out, Master.
-On it.

412
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:24,643
Hurry.

413
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:37,698
Where do we put these?

414
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:42,244
Here! Hide them in this locker
until we leave.

415
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:50,502
Hurry!

416
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:08,854
What the hell was that, guys?

417
00:37:11,607 --> 00:37:12,524
What, are you kidding me?

418
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,734
What?

419
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:17,321
A neutro-quark just hit the satellite.

420
00:37:17,487 --> 00:37:19,281
It's burning a hole through the wall.
You geniuses...

421
00:37:19,448 --> 00:37:23,202
you just throw the door open without
any proper precautionary procedure?

422
00:37:23,368 --> 00:37:24,786
What procedure, bro?

423
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:28,290
You want us to read the manual
for you too, bro?

424
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:30,501
You could have killed everyone in the wing!

425
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:32,878
Exactly! You idiots!

426
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:34,421
I'm angry too!

427
00:37:34,588 --> 00:37:35,547
Oh, no.

428
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:36,757
I mean, can't you see...

429
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:39,968
these authentic mechanic uniforms
that we're wearing on our bodies?

430
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:42,513
That blend in with some of our skin-tones
better than others?

431
00:37:42,888 --> 00:37:44,431
Excuse my friend.

432
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:46,683
He is the boss' nephew. He's a little...

433
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:55,150
Yeah. I got one of those too.

434
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:57,986
I mean, this one? This one I love.

435
00:37:58,153 --> 00:37:59,196
I'm so proud.

436
00:37:59,404 --> 00:38:00,781
You're doing great. So proud of you.

437
00:38:01,156 --> 00:38:02,741
But this one, I just...

438
00:38:09,706 --> 00:38:12,167
-Everything he does drives me crazy.
-Yeah.

439
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:14,670
-I thought you said something else.
-Shut up.

440
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,505
I swear I'm gonna throttle him.

441
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:19,049
I'm gonna go to jail for murder.
I am.

442
00:38:19,216 --> 00:38:20,592
How'd you guys get here so fast?

443
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:22,344
I'll be honest with you,
we just happened in...

444
00:38:22,511 --> 00:38:24,805
before it burned
all the way through, thankfully.

445
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:26,431
Good thing you were here.

446
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:28,475
All right, guys, wrap it up.

447
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:30,686
Looks like we're all clear here.

448
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,692
Our spacesuits!

449
00:38:39,736 --> 00:38:42,322
You threw them in the contamination bin.

450
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:45,075
It expels stuff into space
the moment you shut the door.

451
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:47,911
That would have been helpful information
three minutes ago.

452
00:38:48,078 --> 00:38:50,038
Damn it, Mantis, why don't you ever think?

453
00:38:50,455 --> 00:38:52,249
Are we pretending to be angry again?

454
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:53,584
Mantis, you asshole!

455
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:56,128
Guys, just focus for two seconds.

456
00:38:56,378 --> 00:38:57,588
We'll find another way out of here.

457
00:38:57,754 --> 00:39:00,799
Right now, we need to save Rocket's life.

458
00:39:02,593 --> 00:39:05,387
Nebula, Quinn, and I will get to the records
and get the passkey.

459
00:39:05,554 --> 00:39:08,056
Bug and Doofus, access the spaceport
through the elevator...

460
00:39:08,223 --> 00:39:10,475
so Tree can land and get us out of here.

461
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:12,060
Apologies.

462
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:13,228
No problem.

463
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:15,480
Go.

464
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:31,038
Not my fault I don't know something...

465
00:39:31,163 --> 00:39:32,623
if no one ever tells me.

466
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:34,249
I didn't even wanna come here.

467
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:35,876
I'm gonna need to see your...

468
00:39:36,043 --> 00:39:38,045
You're hopelessly in love...

469
00:39:38,712 --> 00:39:39,713
with him.

470
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:41,256
Oh, no.

471
00:39:41,924 --> 00:39:43,008
Hey.

472
00:39:43,217 --> 00:39:44,218
Hey.

473
00:39:45,677 --> 00:39:46,678
How you doin' today?

474
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:48,931
I'm all right.

475
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:53,393
What was your name again?

476
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:55,145
Drax the Destroyer.

477
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,524
That is such a lovely name.

478
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,109
I'll get the door for you.

479
00:40:03,445 --> 00:40:05,822
-I'll be here when you come back out, okay?
-Sure.

480
00:40:07,241 --> 00:40:08,534
Every single time.

481
00:40:10,536 --> 00:40:12,246
My name is Bletelsnort.

482
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,916
Welcome to OrgoCorp headquarters.

483
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:17,793
For over 300 years...

484
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:20,504
OrgoCorp has been producing
cybernetic implants...

485
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:23,131
and genetic upgrades across the universe...

486
00:40:23,298 --> 00:40:26,718
under the watchful eye
of the High Evolutionary.

487
00:40:28,262 --> 00:40:31,014
That warning we got today,
don't those two match the description?

488
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,642
Attention, all Orgosentries...

489
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:38,063
That manager should have access
to the records.

490
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:41,859
If the passkey is here,
she can get it for us.

491
00:40:42,234 --> 00:40:44,194
All right. I'll handle this one.

492
00:40:44,403 --> 00:40:45,445
How?

493
00:40:45,946 --> 00:40:47,865
Pure Star-Lord charm.

494
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:51,159
I'm excited for you that you get to
see this again for the first time.

495
00:40:58,625 --> 00:40:59,877
Hi, Yura.

496
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,461
Ura.

497
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,921
-Ura.
-Hi.

498
00:41:03,088 --> 00:41:05,132
Hi, my name's Patrick Swayze.

499
00:41:06,175 --> 00:41:08,886
I've been noticing you for quite a while...

500
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:10,804
and the way that you smile to yourself...

501
00:41:10,971 --> 00:41:12,848
when you think nobody is looking...

502
00:41:12,973 --> 00:41:14,975
it makes my every day a bit brighter.

503
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,935
We need your hand.
And it's your choice...

504
00:41:17,144 --> 00:41:18,520
whether it's on your body or not.

505
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:20,772
-What are you doing?
-She was never gonna fall for that.

506
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:22,774
Dude, she was totally into me, man!

507
00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:25,110
-I kind of thought you were a douchebag.
-Come on.

508
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:26,653
-We need a file.
-What file?

509
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,947
89P13. Could that be something?

510
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:31,158
-No.
-Then your use to us...

511
00:41:31,325 --> 00:41:33,076
-is over.
-Wait, wait, wait!

512
00:41:33,202 --> 00:41:34,453
It sounds like a species tag.

513
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:36,747
Show us!

514
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:44,630
All of our research supports the
High Evolutionary's altruistic objective...

515
00:41:44,755 --> 00:41:47,424
of creating a utopian society.

516
00:41:47,633 --> 00:41:49,134
That must be the spaceport.

517
00:41:57,017 --> 00:41:58,101
What is all this?

518
00:41:58,227 --> 00:42:01,647
Species patented over the years
using OrgoCorp tech.

519
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:06,026
Every species OrgoCorp has created
has its own individual file.

520
00:42:06,527 --> 00:42:07,694
I'm so sorry about this.

521
00:42:07,861 --> 00:42:09,821
Listen to me,
this is not the kind of thing we do.

522
00:42:09,988 --> 00:42:11,990
Please, stop it with the subtle jabs!

523
00:42:12,157 --> 00:42:14,993
Old you would have never done this.
You had a purpose higher than yourself.

524
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,203
-A calling to help people.
-Give me a break.

525
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,996
That's why you left Thanos
and formed the Guardians.

526
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:20,165
Except, I didn't form the Guardians.

527
00:42:20,332 --> 00:42:21,959
And I barely left Thanos.

528
00:42:22,084 --> 00:42:24,628
Whoever it was that you were in love with...

529
00:42:25,921 --> 00:42:26,922
it wasn't me.

530
00:42:27,631 --> 00:42:28,882
It sounds more like her.

531
00:42:29,049 --> 00:42:30,050
-Her?
-What?

532
00:42:30,217 --> 00:42:32,928
-That's ridiculous! Don't even...
-Do not bring me into this.

533
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:39,434
-Knock it off!
-What?

534
00:42:39,643 --> 00:42:42,104
Don't look at me like a lost puppy
needing a soft place...

535
00:42:42,271 --> 00:42:43,605
-to lie down.
-I didn't say anything!

536
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:49,736
I just never noticed
how black your eyes were.

537
00:42:52,406 --> 00:42:54,825
They were replaced by my father...

538
00:42:55,576 --> 00:42:56,952
as a method of torture.

539
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,663
He picked a pretty set.

540
00:43:02,082 --> 00:43:03,417
There.

541
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:07,045
That's the file for 89P13.

542
00:43:08,589 --> 00:43:10,090
Heads up, heads up!

543
00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:13,594
Okay.

544
00:43:17,681 --> 00:43:18,682
What?

545
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:34,948
Oh, no.

546
00:43:36,325 --> 00:43:37,326
Walk!

547
00:43:39,661 --> 00:43:40,954
Move it, move it!

548
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:48,879
Stand down!

549
00:43:49,338 --> 00:43:51,089
Drax, we should make a run for it.

550
00:43:51,215 --> 00:43:52,216
Or we could fight.

551
00:43:52,424 --> 00:43:53,300
-Run.
-Fight.

552
00:43:53,509 --> 00:43:54,968
-Run!
-Fight!

553
00:43:55,093 --> 00:43:56,011
Take 'em!

554
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:02,518
What are we gonna do?

555
00:44:04,269 --> 00:44:05,395
-I got a plan.
-What is it?

556
00:44:05,521 --> 00:44:06,522
All of you, come with me...

557
00:44:07,481 --> 00:44:09,858
Everybody, lower your weapons...

558
00:44:10,025 --> 00:44:11,527
or I blow this woman's brains out!

559
00:44:11,693 --> 00:44:12,819
That's the plan?

560
00:44:13,904 --> 00:44:15,906
-You're a kitty cat.
-Meow.

561
00:44:18,492 --> 00:44:20,035
You feel like dancing.

562
00:44:22,246 --> 00:44:23,497
Violent rage.

563
00:44:29,378 --> 00:44:30,796
Lower your weapons!

564
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:37,886
Let's kill that one that looks like a carrot
to show we mean business.

565
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,514
God! Past Gamora's just mean!

566
00:44:40,722 --> 00:44:43,684
She was always like that,
and yet, I was the bad guy.

567
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:45,561
We are not killing anyone!

568
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:46,770
Back off!

569
00:44:49,022 --> 00:44:50,899
Groot, bring the Bowie to us.

570
00:44:51,066 --> 00:44:51,900
Now.

571
00:45:03,161 --> 00:45:04,496
I'm so sorry about this, Ura.

572
00:45:04,705 --> 00:45:05,789
Oh, please.

573
00:45:05,914 --> 00:45:09,293
We're here to save the life of our friend,
that is all.

574
00:45:10,294 --> 00:45:13,088
We paid her to help us get in and get out.

575
00:45:13,172 --> 00:45:14,840
You'd think that'd mean,
"Oh, I'm gonna help you do it in a way...

576
00:45:15,007 --> 00:45:16,175
"that no one knows it's happening."

577
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,594
But no, what she means is,
"I'm gonna shoot people.

578
00:45:18,802 --> 00:45:20,429
-"Threaten people's lives."
-Shut up!

579
00:45:21,471 --> 00:45:24,016
And I know you're probably asking,
why would I trust her?

580
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:26,018
Well, that's a good question.

581
00:45:26,476 --> 00:45:29,479
The answer is, we used to be in love.

582
00:45:29,855 --> 00:45:31,565
Yeah. She was my girlfriend...

583
00:45:31,773 --> 00:45:33,775
only she doesn't remember it,
because it wasn't her.

584
00:45:33,942 --> 00:45:35,736
Because her dad threw her off a magic cliff
and she died...

585
00:45:35,903 --> 00:45:38,780
and then I lost my temper
and nearly destroyed half the universe.

586
00:45:38,947 --> 00:45:42,117
Then she came back, out of the past.
And there she is.

587
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:44,077
Everyone else who died in the past
stayed dead, not her.

588
00:45:44,244 --> 00:45:46,371
Why? Was it the magic cliff? I don't know.

589
00:45:46,538 --> 00:45:48,916
I'm not some
fricking Infinity Stone scientist.

590
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:53,420
Just some dumbass Earth dude who met a girl,
fell in love...

591
00:45:54,046 --> 00:45:55,422
that girl died...

592
00:45:55,923 --> 00:45:58,091
and then came back a total dick.

593
00:46:00,677 --> 00:46:03,222
He left out some important information...

594
00:46:04,014 --> 00:46:05,474
but that is the gist of it.

595
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:13,524
Get to the security hub!

596
00:46:13,649 --> 00:46:14,691
Okay!

597
00:46:23,659 --> 00:46:26,245
Everybody, down on the floor,
or we blow your brains out!

598
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:28,121
Hey, hey, hey, we don't want any...

599
00:46:28,997 --> 00:46:30,874
No! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! No!

600
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:33,627
Come on! Would you please stop doing that?

601
00:46:59,194 --> 00:47:00,320
Yeah!

602
00:47:00,445 --> 00:47:01,572
Hey!

603
00:47:16,837 --> 00:47:17,754
Run.

604
00:47:49,161 --> 00:47:50,579
Drax!

605
00:47:53,123 --> 00:47:56,043
Get on the ground and show me your hands now.

606
00:48:05,385 --> 00:48:06,512
Ura?

607
00:48:07,095 --> 00:48:08,388
Please listen to me.

608
00:48:08,555 --> 00:48:10,766
We need to get out of here with this...

609
00:48:11,016 --> 00:48:12,309
to save my best friend's life.

610
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:15,145
If you could get us into
the system of those sentries out there...

611
00:48:15,312 --> 00:48:16,980
they are good people, like you.

612
00:48:17,147 --> 00:48:18,357
I'm certain of it.

613
00:48:18,482 --> 00:48:20,484
And if I just had an opportunity
to speak to them...

614
00:48:20,651 --> 00:48:23,362
They're corporate shills, you idiot.
They're not gonna listen to you.

615
00:48:23,529 --> 00:48:25,280
They will listen
if I speak to them from my heart.

616
00:48:26,365 --> 00:48:27,366
Ura.

617
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:29,368
Please.

618
00:48:39,336 --> 00:48:40,254
Hey!

619
00:48:43,799 --> 00:48:45,717
Come out now!

620
00:48:46,051 --> 00:48:47,052
Damn it!

621
00:48:54,268 --> 00:48:55,435
You are in.

622
00:48:56,854 --> 00:48:57,813
Tell them your truth.

623
00:48:58,063 --> 00:48:59,439
Yeah, I'm not that big of an idiot.

624
00:48:59,565 --> 00:49:01,108
I just needed to get into the system.

625
00:49:02,818 --> 00:49:03,944
Move it.

626
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:16,832
Told you she was into me.

627
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:39,188
I am Groot?

628
00:49:40,063 --> 00:49:42,316
Yeah, that looked cool.

629
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:53,827
Is sky?

630
00:49:54,328 --> 00:49:55,329
No.

631
00:49:56,288 --> 00:49:59,041
That's not sky, that's a ceiling.

632
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:03,045
But sire's making a new world
for all of us...

633
00:50:03,462 --> 00:50:05,172
and when we get there...

634
00:50:05,547 --> 00:50:07,174
there will be sky...

635
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:11,053
and it will be beautiful and forever.

636
00:50:11,386 --> 00:50:12,429
Wow.

637
00:50:12,554 --> 00:50:14,431
-Whoa.
-Whoa.

638
00:50:15,849 --> 00:50:17,851
I have been thinking.

639
00:50:18,685 --> 00:50:19,686
'Bout what?

640
00:50:20,562 --> 00:50:22,147
Nothing in particular.

641
00:50:22,773 --> 00:50:26,193
But I thought,
since you guys are my closest friends...

642
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,111
and my only friends...

643
00:50:28,278 --> 00:50:32,658
you might be interested in knowing
that I have been thinking.

644
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:34,326
That's cool.

645
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,787
I've been thinking, too...

646
00:50:37,037 --> 00:50:39,540
about something more singular.

647
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:42,751
When sire moves us to the new world...

648
00:50:43,418 --> 00:50:44,753
we're gonna need names.

649
00:50:45,671 --> 00:50:46,672
I mean...

650
00:50:46,839 --> 00:50:48,715
89Q12...

651
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:50,300
it's not really a name...

652
00:50:51,927 --> 00:50:55,806
so I would like my name to be...

653
00:50:57,099 --> 00:50:58,183
Lylla.

654
00:50:58,892 --> 00:51:00,102
Lylla.

655
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:01,645
Lylla.

656
00:51:02,062 --> 00:51:03,438
Lylla.

657
00:51:03,522 --> 00:51:05,607
That's a pretty name, Lylla.

658
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,068
Thank you.

659
00:51:09,194 --> 00:51:12,573
I think my name shall be Teefs...

660
00:51:13,448 --> 00:51:15,826
because, although we all do have them...

661
00:51:16,201 --> 00:51:18,662
mine are definitely the most prominent.

662
00:51:20,205 --> 00:51:21,999
-Teefs.
-Teefs.

663
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:23,959
-Lylla.
-Teefs.

664
00:51:24,626 --> 00:51:29,339
Me be called Floor,
because me is lying on floor.

665
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,551
You're lying on a floor,
so your name is Floor?

666
00:51:33,969 --> 00:51:35,345
Yes!

667
00:51:36,763 --> 00:51:38,599
-Floor.
-Floor.

668
00:51:38,765 --> 00:51:40,309
What about you, friend?

669
00:51:43,395 --> 00:51:47,149
Someday, I'm gonna make
great machines that fly...

670
00:51:47,941 --> 00:51:50,986
and me and my friends
are gonna go flyin' together...

671
00:51:51,195 --> 00:51:54,364
into the forever and beautiful sky.

672
00:51:55,073 --> 00:51:57,534
Lylla, and Teefs...

673
00:51:57,868 --> 00:52:00,746
and Floor, and me...

674
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,415
Rocket.

675
00:52:05,834 --> 00:52:07,211
Rocket.

676
00:52:08,212 --> 00:52:10,672
It really is good to have friends.

677
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:12,674
Yeah.

678
00:52:18,138 --> 00:52:19,640
Start the incision here.

679
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:23,727
Keep calm.

680
00:52:26,897 --> 00:52:28,649
-Hold it still.
-I can't!

681
00:52:28,774 --> 00:52:31,360
It won't stop moving.

682
00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:34,780
Why did he never tell us about any of this?

683
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,616
This is worse than what Thanos did to me.

684
00:52:39,451 --> 00:52:41,620
Well, what about the passkey? Is it there?

685
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:48,335
No. But a file was removed today.

686
00:52:48,502 --> 00:52:50,879
Downloaded and deleted,
a million characters in length.

687
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:55,509
The biometrics say it was this man.
Recorder B2H6.

688
00:52:55,676 --> 00:52:57,094
I saw this guy outside of records today.

689
00:52:59,721 --> 00:53:01,890
Looks like one of
the High Evolutionary's recorders.

690
00:53:02,516 --> 00:53:03,851
The High Evolutionary?

691
00:53:04,893 --> 00:53:06,228
The founder of OrgoCorp?

692
00:53:06,395 --> 00:53:08,188
OrgoCorp is just a way
to fund his experiments...

693
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:10,148
that lie outside intergalactic laws.

694
00:53:10,357 --> 00:53:12,401
He's created whole societies.

695
00:53:12,734 --> 00:53:14,903
Xeronians, the Ani-Men...

696
00:53:15,028 --> 00:53:16,363
-the Sovereign.
-The Sovereign?

697
00:53:16,572 --> 00:53:18,615
Corners of the universe consider him God.

698
00:53:20,284 --> 00:53:21,493
I am Groot.

699
00:53:21,702 --> 00:53:22,661
Yes.

700
00:53:22,828 --> 00:53:23,912
Yes, what? That he's Groot?

701
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,457
He said maybe this man downloaded the passkey
into the computer on his head.

702
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:31,086
That could store the passkey.

703
00:53:31,295 --> 00:53:32,963
We find him, we save Rocket.

704
00:53:33,672 --> 00:53:35,716
The High Evolutionary's coordinates.

705
00:53:37,426 --> 00:53:38,552
Put the coordinates in the nav.

706
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:39,720
Wait a minute.

707
00:53:40,596 --> 00:53:41,889
Are you kidding me?

708
00:53:42,347 --> 00:53:45,267
What he wants
is that gutted badger in the Med-Bay...

709
00:53:45,434 --> 00:53:47,227
and you're gonna bring it straight to him?

710
00:53:47,895 --> 00:53:49,021
It's almost certainly a trap.

711
00:53:49,646 --> 00:53:52,566
Trap isn't a trap if you know the trap
is trying to trap you. It's a face-off.

712
00:53:52,691 --> 00:53:55,068
A face-off is a trap if you're facing off...

713
00:53:55,277 --> 00:53:58,030
against a guy a thousand times
more powerful than you.

714
00:53:59,031 --> 00:54:01,033
Do you know who the High Evolutionary is?

715
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:04,453
Yeah, he's some dickhead
who dissected my best friend.

716
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:06,455
-Second best.
-The High Evolutionary...

717
00:54:06,663 --> 00:54:08,498
isn't someone you wanna
think about messing with.

718
00:54:08,707 --> 00:54:10,501
We won't think about it when we do it.

719
00:54:10,709 --> 00:54:12,586
You know what? I don't care!

720
00:54:12,711 --> 00:54:13,754
Just drop me off with the Ravagers...

721
00:54:13,962 --> 00:54:15,923
and you go do
whatever it is that you wanna do.

722
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:17,174
We don't have time for this.

723
00:54:17,382 --> 00:54:19,843
I'm not asking you.
Drop me off with my people now!

724
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:22,846
"Your people"?
The Ravagers aren't your people.

725
00:54:23,013 --> 00:54:24,848
I'm a damn Ravager. You aren't.

726
00:54:26,475 --> 00:54:28,936
Listen, I know you were always
looking for a family. Okay?

727
00:54:29,102 --> 00:54:30,687
But my Gamora, the one I loved...

728
00:54:30,812 --> 00:54:32,064
she didn't find it
with a group of criminals...

729
00:54:32,272 --> 00:54:33,398
she found it with us.

730
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:35,776
People who care about you.

731
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:38,195
I know that's who you still are.

732
00:54:38,904 --> 00:54:40,697
Somewhere inside of you...

733
00:54:43,617 --> 00:54:48,413
What are you so afraid of in your self
that I need to be something for you?

734
00:54:48,872 --> 00:54:51,583
I don't give a shit about your Gamora.

735
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:53,043
Life made me me!

736
00:54:55,796 --> 00:54:58,715
I have a few upgrades courtesy of
that gutted badger in the Med-Bay...

737
00:54:58,841 --> 00:55:01,552
and we are not risking his life
to make yours more convenient.

738
00:55:01,718 --> 00:55:02,845
I'm family.

739
00:55:03,011 --> 00:55:04,513
So is he.

740
00:55:08,934 --> 00:55:10,227
Screw you.

741
00:55:12,771 --> 00:55:14,565
Screw all of you.

742
00:55:26,618 --> 00:55:28,662
Found him on the outskirts
of the first shield...

743
00:55:28,787 --> 00:55:30,873
pirating supply ships.

744
00:55:31,748 --> 00:55:33,000
I do appreciate this, good sir.

745
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:37,171
And I appreciate your generous contribution
to the Orgosentry retirement fund.

746
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:38,672
Your associate...

747
00:55:39,381 --> 00:55:42,843
a Zehoberei named Gamora,
where is she now?

748
00:55:42,968 --> 00:55:44,219
You ain't getting nothing from me.

749
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:47,055
Oh, we'll see about that,
won't we?

750
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:49,057
Adam.

751
00:55:50,392 --> 00:55:51,476
Adam.

752
00:55:51,643 --> 00:55:52,644
Yes, Mother?

753
00:55:52,811 --> 00:55:54,104
Show him we mean business.

754
00:56:15,959 --> 00:56:19,171
I said show him we mean business,
not disintegrate him!

755
00:56:19,379 --> 00:56:20,756
What more business could we have shown him?

756
00:56:20,881 --> 00:56:22,424
But now he's of no use to us!

757
00:56:22,591 --> 00:56:23,634
Well, let's just question
the man's friend.

758
00:56:23,759 --> 00:56:25,427
Friend? You think that's a friend?

759
00:56:25,594 --> 00:56:26,762
It's an animal!

760
00:56:29,139 --> 00:56:30,516
He looks sad.

761
00:56:32,267 --> 00:56:34,186
I really don't enjoy
how that's making me feel, actually.

762
00:56:37,105 --> 00:56:38,106
Your friend's a moron.

763
00:56:38,565 --> 00:56:40,317
I got one of those too. I get it.

764
00:56:41,151 --> 00:56:42,152
Outpost?

765
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:43,529
This is Gamora, you there?

766
00:56:46,281 --> 00:56:47,282
Fitz-Gibbonok.

767
00:56:47,491 --> 00:56:48,492
Come in.

768
00:56:53,705 --> 00:56:55,249
Outpost, come in.

769
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:57,918
Yes, Gamora.

770
00:56:58,585 --> 00:56:59,920
Salutations.

771
00:57:00,045 --> 00:57:01,380
May I help?

772
00:57:02,422 --> 00:57:03,966
Well, I need you guys to come pick me up.

773
00:57:04,132 --> 00:57:06,802
I'm gonna upload the location-link
to the craft I'm on.

774
00:57:07,344 --> 00:57:09,429
Oh, I think we can arrange that.

775
00:58:05,944 --> 00:58:09,198
You need to say to him
exactly what I told you to say.

776
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:11,033
Why don't you just say it?

777
00:58:11,158 --> 00:58:13,493
No one ever listens to me.

778
00:58:28,759 --> 00:58:29,801
Quill...

779
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:31,887
life is a pond...

780
00:58:32,804 --> 00:58:36,058
and you've spent your entire life
leaping from woman to woman...

781
00:58:36,225 --> 00:58:38,477
as if they're lily pads
upon this great pond.

782
00:58:39,186 --> 00:58:41,480
Perhaps, what you need to do, Quill...

783
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:44,483
is learn to swim.

784
00:58:48,237 --> 00:58:49,321
That actually made sense.

785
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:50,447
Yes, it made sense.

786
00:58:50,656 --> 00:58:52,824
No, I mean, that's sort of an analogy.

787
00:58:53,617 --> 00:58:56,828
And I didn't know that you were capable
of that type of thought.

788
00:58:56,954 --> 00:58:58,539
I know lots of analogies, Quill.

789
00:58:58,997 --> 00:59:01,124
Analogies, metaphors, et cetera.

790
00:59:02,334 --> 00:59:03,377
For instance...

791
00:59:04,628 --> 00:59:08,215
Gamora's head is like a lily pad
because it is green.

792
00:59:09,633 --> 00:59:10,884
Analogy.

793
00:59:11,593 --> 00:59:12,970
And also stupid-looking...

794
00:59:13,136 --> 00:59:14,388
-and flappy.
-Flappy?

795
00:59:14,596 --> 00:59:17,015
Because her skin is made of a leaf.

796
00:59:17,474 --> 00:59:18,475
Metaphor.

797
00:59:18,684 --> 00:59:19,935
Is it?

798
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:23,230
Yesterday, I made a poop
shaped like a fish.

799
00:59:23,397 --> 00:59:27,192
Even my butt is capable of making an analogy.

800
00:59:37,327 --> 00:59:38,370
What's happening?

801
00:59:38,996 --> 00:59:40,789
The fluid is in his lungs.

802
00:59:41,832 --> 00:59:43,458
P13?

803
00:59:44,793 --> 00:59:46,128
P13.

804
00:59:47,963 --> 00:59:49,047
Sire.

805
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:51,341
P13!

806
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:54,011
-My lord, might I suggest that we...
-Where is it? I passed it.

807
00:59:54,636 --> 00:59:55,637
Must...

808
00:59:57,389 --> 01:00:01,393
Sire was in the middle of his treatments
when we had a breakthrough with Batch 92.

809
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,353
Perhaps then we should resume tomorrow, yes?

810
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,439
"We shall resume tomorrow," no!

811
01:00:05,647 --> 01:00:06,857
P13!

812
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:11,111
There you are.

813
01:00:21,205 --> 01:00:22,206
Hello.

814
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:34,259
How did you know...

815
01:00:34,927 --> 01:00:38,388
about the microseminoproteins, P13?

816
01:01:02,496 --> 01:01:04,122
What happened in there?

817
01:01:05,123 --> 01:01:06,124
Why?

818
01:01:06,834 --> 01:01:09,336
How did you know, P13?

819
01:01:09,461 --> 01:01:11,421
It was too little filtration...

820
01:01:11,547 --> 01:01:14,174
In the hypotonic, yes, we know,
we fixed that.

821
01:01:14,299 --> 01:01:15,926
But how did you know?

822
01:01:16,635 --> 01:01:18,971
I made you!

823
01:01:19,137 --> 01:01:21,265
How did you know?

824
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:26,603
Because it worked.

825
01:01:33,694 --> 01:01:35,070
It worked.

826
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:39,867
Their rage is gone.

827
01:01:40,868 --> 01:01:43,495
We have the peaceful creatures
we always sought...

828
01:01:43,704 --> 01:01:46,206
ready to inhabit the new world.

829
01:01:49,168 --> 01:01:50,878
We're going to the new world?

830
01:01:53,255 --> 01:01:54,381
We?

831
01:01:57,009 --> 01:01:58,218
Look at you.

832
01:01:58,552 --> 01:01:59,678
As if you were...

833
01:01:59,845 --> 01:02:02,472
cobbled together by fat-fingered children.

834
01:02:02,598 --> 01:02:05,559
How could you be part of a perfect species?

835
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:09,771
You're simply a medley of mistakes
we could learn from...

836
01:02:09,897 --> 01:02:12,566
and apply to the creatures
that truly mattered.

837
01:02:13,984 --> 01:02:19,156
Batch 89 was never meant
for the new world, P13.

838
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:20,824
You could figure out...

839
01:02:20,991 --> 01:02:24,620
the complex workings
of cytoplasmic filtration systems...

840
01:02:24,828 --> 01:02:26,705
but you couldn't figure out that?

841
01:02:30,792 --> 01:02:32,252
But that brain.

842
01:02:33,545 --> 01:02:35,631
That, I'd like to study further.

843
01:02:40,177 --> 01:02:43,430
Prep it for surgery and removal
in the morning.

844
01:02:44,515 --> 01:02:46,391
What about the rest of Batch 89, sire?

845
01:02:50,187 --> 01:02:51,563
Incinerate them.

846
01:02:59,488 --> 01:03:02,074
He's dying.
We need that passkey.

847
01:03:03,033 --> 01:03:04,243
We don't have long.

848
01:03:05,536 --> 01:03:07,079
We've arrived.

849
01:03:22,302 --> 01:03:23,679
That looks just like...

850
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:25,931
home.

851
01:03:38,527 --> 01:03:40,362
It's like a replica of Earth.

852
01:03:40,529 --> 01:03:41,697
It makes no sense.

853
01:03:41,905 --> 01:03:44,950
Atmosphere is habitable.
Gravity's Xandar minus one.

854
01:04:37,586 --> 01:04:38,587
Hello.

855
01:04:38,754 --> 01:04:41,173
We mean you no harm.

856
01:04:52,434 --> 01:04:54,478
Listen to me, he was just trying
to throw her back her ball.

857
01:04:57,397 --> 01:04:58,398
Hey!

858
01:04:59,858 --> 01:05:01,485
Come on! There's no reason...

859
01:05:03,278 --> 01:05:04,279
Hey, hey.

860
01:05:04,404 --> 01:05:06,198
Groot, full Kaiju!

861
01:05:06,365 --> 01:05:08,784
-Not full Kaiju!
-I am...

862
01:05:09,159 --> 01:05:10,202
-Groot!
-Back up.

863
01:05:10,327 --> 01:05:11,662
No, not Kaiju!

864
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:13,080
Groot, down!

865
01:05:13,247 --> 01:05:14,748
There's no reason to be afraid.

866
01:05:17,584 --> 01:05:18,752
Get down, Groot!

867
01:05:19,461 --> 01:05:20,796
Everybody, it's okay.
It's okay.

868
01:05:21,004 --> 01:05:22,047
Hey. Hey, hi.

869
01:05:22,256 --> 01:05:23,882
We're not here to harm you.

870
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:25,801
Okay.

871
01:05:26,176 --> 01:05:27,761
See? Here.

872
01:05:28,929 --> 01:05:30,138
For your knee.

873
01:05:32,474 --> 01:05:34,184
We just need to save our friend.

874
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:41,233
Filthy. It doesn't belong here.

875
01:05:42,776 --> 01:05:45,028
I will train it in the ways of the Sovereign.

876
01:05:48,115 --> 01:05:49,324
I will train him not to do that.

877
01:05:49,449 --> 01:05:51,785
It's an act of blasphemy
even having it here.

878
01:05:52,369 --> 01:05:54,246
Kill it. Now.

879
01:05:54,997 --> 01:05:58,792
I am the Warlock, Mum,
and I am done with being ordered around.

880
01:06:00,127 --> 01:06:01,336
Gamora is here.

881
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,257
Which means the squirrel is also.

882
01:06:05,424 --> 01:06:07,509
To save ourselves,
we must bring it to the High Evolutionary...

883
01:06:07,634 --> 01:06:09,469
before his own people do.

884
01:06:33,952 --> 01:06:34,995
Yeah, yeah, sit.

885
01:06:35,204 --> 01:06:36,788
Let's sit. Okay.

886
01:06:46,507 --> 01:06:47,633
I am Groot.

887
01:06:47,841 --> 01:06:49,593
It's not rude. It's what it's here for.

888
01:06:49,801 --> 01:06:51,178
Drax, sit up!

889
01:06:51,345 --> 01:06:52,346
Idiot.

890
01:06:54,473 --> 01:06:55,516
Thank you.

891
01:06:59,895 --> 01:07:01,021
Thank you.

892
01:07:02,731 --> 01:07:04,525
Our friend...

893
01:07:05,817 --> 01:07:07,027
He's dying.

894
01:07:13,367 --> 01:07:16,328
We love our friend.

895
01:07:17,871 --> 01:07:19,248
But he is dying.

896
01:07:22,376 --> 01:07:24,419
That's not dying, that's already dead.

897
01:07:24,545 --> 01:07:25,879
They'll think he's already dead.

898
01:07:26,088 --> 01:07:28,006
They'll think we're here
on a quest for revenge.

899
01:07:28,173 --> 01:07:29,842
Drax, sit up.

900
01:07:30,008 --> 01:07:31,009
That's what it's here for!

901
01:07:31,176 --> 01:07:32,261
Drax, it isn't.

902
01:07:32,427 --> 01:07:33,971
It's made for people
to sit shoulder to shoulder...

903
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:36,098
right next to each other.
Get your boots off her pillows.

904
01:07:36,223 --> 01:07:38,642
I find it hard to believe
it doesn't have multiple purposes!

905
01:07:38,851 --> 01:07:40,185
I'm sorry. My friend...

906
01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:41,520
is a dumbass.

907
01:07:42,813 --> 01:07:44,314
That's the same as your dying.

908
01:07:44,481 --> 01:07:46,149
Why do you criticize everything?

909
01:07:46,316 --> 01:07:47,568
Well, why is it oblong then?

910
01:07:47,651 --> 01:07:48,902
It was a totally different sound.

911
01:07:49,111 --> 01:07:52,072
No, it wasn't. Dying. Dumbass. See?
It's the same.

912
01:07:52,239 --> 01:07:53,282
All right, guys!

913
01:07:53,657 --> 01:07:55,909
Can I proceed, please,
to try to save our friend?

914
01:07:56,076 --> 01:07:57,452
Drax, I see you!

915
01:07:58,745 --> 01:08:03,250
I understand that none of this
makes any sense to you right now.

916
01:08:03,667 --> 01:08:05,836
We need your help...

917
01:08:06,503 --> 01:08:08,630
in finding a man.

918
01:08:09,631 --> 01:08:10,841
I'm gonna draw.

919
01:08:11,049 --> 01:08:13,260
I'm gonna draw the man
that we're looking for.

920
01:08:15,179 --> 01:08:16,638
Like this.

921
01:08:17,472 --> 01:08:18,849
You see the thing on her head?

922
01:08:19,349 --> 01:08:22,394
-He has a thing like this.
-That is delightful.

923
01:08:22,603 --> 01:08:24,021
There you go.

924
01:08:24,855 --> 01:08:27,274
Have you seen this man?

925
01:08:29,026 --> 01:08:30,444
That's very good.

926
01:08:30,569 --> 01:08:32,613
Can I have that later
to hang in my apartment, please?

927
01:08:32,779 --> 01:08:34,573
Yeah.
Thank you.

928
01:08:36,241 --> 01:08:37,951
His name is "Mowtio"?

929
01:08:56,762 --> 01:08:59,014
Many mowtios. There?

930
01:08:59,932 --> 01:09:01,433
At the pyramid.

931
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:06,772
Is that your car in the driveway?

932
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,738
Drax, stay here with Rocket.

933
01:09:14,905 --> 01:09:16,031
Watch him. That's who they're coming for.

934
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,449
-I wanna come.
-No.

935
01:09:17,741 --> 01:09:19,493
Mantis, watch Drax.

936
01:09:19,618 --> 01:09:21,787
Groot, you know what to do with these.

937
01:09:29,586 --> 01:09:31,255
-Push down on it.
-What?

938
01:09:31,463 --> 01:09:33,507
-Push it down.
-I am pushing down on it.

939
01:09:33,674 --> 01:09:34,424
Push the button.

940
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:37,719
-It looks like you're pushing the keyhole.
-The what?

941
01:09:37,886 --> 01:09:40,973
There's a button under the handle,
press that in.

942
01:09:42,349 --> 01:09:43,851
Okay. Now what?

943
01:09:44,059 --> 01:09:45,519
Open the fucking door.

944
01:09:47,813 --> 01:09:49,648
That is a stupid design...

945
01:09:49,773 --> 01:09:52,651
and your instructions were very unclear.

946
01:09:53,235 --> 01:09:55,529
Let's get that passkey and save our friend.

947
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,579
I was eight years old
when I left Earth, okay?

948
01:10:03,745 --> 01:10:05,873
Why would I know any more about
driving one of these things than you do?

949
01:10:06,039 --> 01:10:06,957
Don't see you volunteering.

950
01:10:07,124 --> 01:10:08,125
-You want me to drive?
-No.

951
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:09,668
-I'll drive.
-I don't want you to drive.

952
01:10:09,793 --> 01:10:10,711
I got this.

953
01:10:55,756 --> 01:10:58,300
You must be a really loyal pet...

954
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,720
if they're willing to do all this for you.

955
01:12:10,581 --> 01:12:12,791
This is the perfect society?

956
01:12:33,478 --> 01:12:34,479
Sire.

957
01:12:34,646 --> 01:12:36,773
This one has been running for two hours...

958
01:12:36,899 --> 01:12:38,525
without breaking a sweat.

959
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:40,152
-It's incredible...
-They can survive...

960
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:41,570
on thirty calories a day...

961
01:12:41,695 --> 01:12:44,573
an hour's sleep a week,
they're always happy...

962
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:46,742
and they can rewire a carbenetrix core...

963
01:12:46,867 --> 01:12:48,827
in under two minutes.

964
01:12:49,161 --> 01:12:51,872
But will she be ready for the new colony?

965
01:12:52,581 --> 01:12:54,499
Sire, they're here.

966
01:13:01,089 --> 01:13:02,216
Here we go.

967
01:13:10,224 --> 01:13:11,225
We're here to see...

968
01:13:11,475 --> 01:13:13,936
The High Evolutionary is expecting you.

969
01:13:14,061 --> 01:13:15,145
Which means it is a trap.

970
01:13:15,354 --> 01:13:16,396
It's a face-off.

971
01:13:16,563 --> 01:13:18,857
-She stays here.
-Why?

972
01:13:18,982 --> 01:13:20,067
Policy against weaponry...

973
01:13:20,234 --> 01:13:21,652
and your arm is a gun.

974
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:28,492
-He's clean.
-Let's go.

975
01:13:29,034 --> 01:13:30,035
Hey.

976
01:13:31,286 --> 01:13:32,704
It'll be okay.

977
01:13:53,684 --> 01:13:54,852
Move it!

978
01:14:13,996 --> 01:14:15,539
Are you okay, Rocket?

979
01:14:33,682 --> 01:14:35,100
Me Rocket play now?

980
01:14:35,267 --> 01:14:36,268
I can't right now, Floor.

981
01:14:43,942 --> 01:14:44,943
What are you doing?

982
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:46,820
They ain't gonna set us free.

983
01:14:47,613 --> 01:14:48,864
Yes, they are, Rocket.

984
01:14:48,947 --> 01:14:50,949
We're going to the new world any day now.

985
01:14:54,494 --> 01:14:55,829
No, that can't be true.

986
01:14:55,996 --> 01:14:56,997
It is.

987
01:14:57,789 --> 01:14:59,458
They wanna kill us all in the morning.

988
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:00,459
What?

989
01:15:00,626 --> 01:15:01,835
What?

990
01:15:02,002 --> 01:15:03,337
But I'm gonna fix it.

991
01:15:09,134 --> 01:15:10,302
What is that?

992
01:15:10,511 --> 01:15:11,887
It's a key.

993
01:15:12,679 --> 01:15:14,806
I'm gonna use it to get us all out of here.

994
01:15:15,807 --> 01:15:17,893
I don't know if that's wise, Rocket.

995
01:15:18,727 --> 01:15:20,103
Me Rocket leave!

996
01:15:20,229 --> 01:15:22,648
Hooray time forever!

997
01:15:23,649 --> 01:15:26,318
Just down that hall, there are ships.

998
01:15:27,361 --> 01:15:29,696
I know. And if we can get to one...

999
01:15:29,863 --> 01:15:31,031
I can pilot it.

1000
01:15:31,823 --> 01:15:34,785
And then we'll all fly away together,
the four of us...

1001
01:15:35,661 --> 01:15:37,162
just like we always said, okay?

1002
01:15:39,998 --> 01:15:41,041
Okay?

1003
01:15:45,254 --> 01:15:49,091
Yippee! Rocket! Sky, sky, sky!

1004
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:13,740
-You did it!
-Yes! Yes! Yes!

1005
01:16:13,949 --> 01:16:14,867
You did it!

1006
01:16:15,075 --> 01:16:17,160
You did it, you did it, you did it!

1007
01:16:38,098 --> 01:16:39,099
You did it!

1008
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:41,351
You did it.

1009
01:16:43,145 --> 01:16:44,521
It really is good to have...

1010
01:17:01,622 --> 01:17:04,750
Yes, I imagined you'd do something like this.

1011
01:17:05,626 --> 01:17:07,461
Back in the cage, P13.

1012
01:17:13,425 --> 01:17:14,968
Sky.

1013
01:17:28,982 --> 01:17:32,444
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1014
01:17:32,611 --> 01:17:36,114
-Q12 and P13 escaped from their pens.
-Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1015
01:17:36,281 --> 01:17:38,367
-Q12 is neutralized...
-Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1016
01:17:38,534 --> 01:17:40,494
-Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.
-...but P13 is still out...

1017
01:17:40,702 --> 01:17:43,372
-so I'll need assistance.
-Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1018
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:45,749
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1019
01:17:45,916 --> 01:17:48,001
Remember not to bruise its brain.

1020
01:17:55,259 --> 01:17:57,177
All right, P13!

1021
01:17:57,344 --> 01:18:00,305
You win the crying contest.
Now, back in the cage.

1022
01:18:03,433 --> 01:18:04,518
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1023
01:18:04,726 --> 01:18:06,103
-Rocket, let's go!
-Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1024
01:18:06,228 --> 01:18:08,105
-Let's go! Rocket, please!
-Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1025
01:18:08,313 --> 01:18:09,273
Rocket!

1026
01:18:09,773 --> 01:18:11,024
Rocket!

1027
01:18:13,277 --> 01:18:14,695
Down here. Hurry.

1028
01:19:12,794 --> 01:19:13,795
-Hey, there it is!
-Get him!

1029
01:19:13,962 --> 01:19:16,089
-Get back here!
-Get it!

1030
01:20:01,552 --> 01:20:02,594
What are you doing?

1031
01:20:02,761 --> 01:20:04,054
I got a bad feeling about this.

1032
01:20:04,221 --> 01:20:06,056
Peter just told you to stay here.

1033
01:20:06,223 --> 01:20:07,224
Yeah, well, that's his fault.

1034
01:20:07,349 --> 01:20:10,519
He should know by now that I never
do anything that anyone ever tells me.

1035
01:20:10,727 --> 01:20:12,479
We need to protect Rocket.

1036
01:20:12,896 --> 01:20:14,147
Yeah, that's right.

1037
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:17,359
So, hop on and we'll ride back to the ship.

1038
01:20:17,526 --> 01:20:19,278
Just right over there?

1039
01:20:19,862 --> 01:20:20,863
Yeah.

1040
01:20:31,373 --> 01:20:34,334
Drax! Hey! Stop being a jerk!

1041
01:20:43,468 --> 01:20:44,469
You!

1042
01:20:45,095 --> 01:20:46,346
Hey, yeah, you!

1043
01:20:48,015 --> 01:20:50,225
I take it the passkey,
it's in that thing on your head.

1044
01:20:51,268 --> 01:20:52,811
I would advise against aggression.

1045
01:20:54,396 --> 01:20:55,522
Got time for me now?

1046
01:20:56,273 --> 01:20:59,193
Your friend once took advantage.

1047
01:20:59,776 --> 01:21:01,153
I learn my lessons.

1048
01:21:01,778 --> 01:21:05,240
I aim some small part
of my mental capacity...

1049
01:21:05,324 --> 01:21:07,117
back in my own direction...

1050
01:21:07,284 --> 01:21:10,370
and now, gravity itself serves my whims.

1051
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:12,831
War Pig.

1052
01:21:12,998 --> 01:21:14,124
Now.

1053
01:21:17,586 --> 01:21:19,713
You must find Counter-Earth familiar.

1054
01:21:19,922 --> 01:21:20,923
Counter-Earth?

1055
01:21:21,048 --> 01:21:23,091
I visited your planet many years ago.

1056
01:21:23,258 --> 01:21:24,968
Earth hasn't been my planet in a long time.

1057
01:21:25,135 --> 01:21:26,220
Your people had...

1058
01:21:27,137 --> 01:21:28,222
wonderful spirit.

1059
01:21:29,056 --> 01:21:33,227
The art and music and literature
were some of the finest in the universe.

1060
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:38,565
Earth would be a fabulous place,
were it not for the ignorance and bigotry.

1061
01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:40,734
-Okay.
-It inspired me to create Counter-Earth.

1062
01:21:40,901 --> 01:21:42,402
I don't care.

1063
01:21:42,569 --> 01:21:44,071
All of the good and none of the bad.

1064
01:21:44,238 --> 01:21:47,199
I don't need another speech
by some impotent whackjob...

1065
01:21:47,366 --> 01:21:48,617
whose mother didn't love him...

1066
01:21:48,784 --> 01:21:51,245
rationalizing why he needs
to conquer the universe.

1067
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:54,248
I'm not trying to conquer the universe...

1068
01:21:54,915 --> 01:21:55,999
I'm perfecting it.

1069
01:22:02,005 --> 01:22:03,465
What the...

1070
01:22:22,776 --> 01:22:23,777
Hey!

1071
01:22:24,278 --> 01:22:25,737
Drop the badger.

1072
01:22:30,659 --> 01:22:33,996
-I just want the passkey.
-Then bring me 89P13.

1073
01:22:34,162 --> 01:22:35,414
I am Groot.

1074
01:22:36,039 --> 01:22:37,833
He says, "Suck my..."

1075
01:22:38,041 --> 01:22:39,209
Why are you so angry?

1076
01:22:39,418 --> 01:22:41,211
Because I know what you did to our friend.

1077
01:22:41,837 --> 01:22:45,048
Anything I've done,
I've done for the betterment of the universe.

1078
01:22:45,215 --> 01:22:46,508
Newsflash, Einstein.

1079
01:22:46,675 --> 01:22:49,636
Better universes generally don't include
a bunch of octopuses selling meth...

1080
01:22:49,803 --> 01:22:51,597
to guys with cockroach heads.

1081
01:22:52,973 --> 01:22:53,974
They do not.

1082
01:22:56,476 --> 01:22:57,477
Which is why...

1083
01:22:57,644 --> 01:22:59,813
as I have done many times before...

1084
01:23:00,272 --> 01:23:02,107
I'm going to have to raze it all...

1085
01:23:02,774 --> 01:23:03,984
and start again.

1086
01:23:04,151 --> 01:23:05,194
What?

1087
01:23:13,827 --> 01:23:15,579
I got 89P13...

1088
01:23:15,704 --> 01:23:17,122
and I'm on my way.

1089
01:23:17,331 --> 01:23:18,665
We're in possession of the subject.

1090
01:23:45,317 --> 01:23:46,610
Oh, my God.

1091
01:23:57,329 --> 01:23:58,372
I am Groot?

1092
01:23:58,497 --> 01:23:59,540
Kill 'em all.

1093
01:24:02,584 --> 01:24:03,669
Stay.

1094
01:24:06,088 --> 01:24:07,130
I said "stay."

1095
01:24:08,423 --> 01:24:11,009
What, did you want me to leave you back,
so that Mother could fillet you?

1096
01:24:12,261 --> 01:24:13,303
Stay.

1097
01:24:13,470 --> 01:24:14,471
What the hell?

1098
01:24:14,638 --> 01:24:17,349
-We're working for the same boss.
-Yes...

1099
01:24:17,975 --> 01:24:19,142
but I need the credit, chum...

1100
01:24:19,268 --> 01:24:21,186
to save my entire civilization.

1101
01:24:22,145 --> 01:24:25,232
So be a good creepy thing...

1102
01:24:25,399 --> 01:24:26,233
and back off.

1103
01:24:35,826 --> 01:24:36,869
No.

1104
01:25:17,492 --> 01:25:18,619
Mother.

1105
01:25:42,851 --> 01:25:44,686
Mother!

1106
01:25:49,566 --> 01:25:50,901
Mantis and Drax, come in.

1107
01:25:51,652 --> 01:25:53,070
Mantis?
Drax?

1108
01:25:53,779 --> 01:25:54,780
Hey.

1109
01:25:54,947 --> 01:25:57,199
I need you to bring the ship here now!

1110
01:25:57,324 --> 01:26:01,620
Well, we can't do that exactly
because we're not at the ship.

1111
01:26:01,745 --> 01:26:02,829
Then where the hell are...

1112
01:26:31,692 --> 01:26:32,693
Nebula, come in.

1113
01:26:32,818 --> 01:26:36,697
Gamora! Take off now!
Get yourself and Rocket off the planet.

1114
01:26:42,327 --> 01:26:43,579
What kinda ship is this?

1115
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,542
It's amusing, really.

1116
01:26:48,667 --> 01:26:50,085
How stupid are you, hmm?

1117
01:26:50,294 --> 01:26:51,920
It was so obviously a trap.

1118
01:26:52,421 --> 01:26:54,965
It's not a trap. It's a face-off.

1119
01:26:55,632 --> 01:26:57,301
Now kill them all.

1120
01:26:58,719 --> 01:26:59,720
What do you have in your hand?

1121
01:27:03,891 --> 01:27:04,892
Grenade!

1122
01:27:42,971 --> 01:27:46,433
I am Groot!

1123
01:28:18,465 --> 01:28:19,508
No! Don't!

1124
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:22,928
Don't! No, no, no! No, please!
Please, spare me!

1125
01:28:23,095 --> 01:28:24,888
Please, spare me, please.

1126
01:28:28,809 --> 01:28:31,395
Thank you. Thank you. Thank...

1127
01:28:31,603 --> 01:28:32,729
That'd be premature.

1128
01:28:33,856 --> 01:28:35,357
No, no, no...

1129
01:28:46,368 --> 01:28:50,706
Quite a novel escape plan,
jumping headfirst into an exploding planet.

1130
01:28:55,794 --> 01:28:57,504
You'll kill us both!

1131
01:28:57,671 --> 01:28:58,964
Not both.

1132
01:29:15,147 --> 01:29:16,148
Why are we doing this?

1133
01:29:16,356 --> 01:29:18,734
Quill and Groot are inside.
We have to get them out.

1134
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:48,680
Groot.

1135
01:30:05,489 --> 01:30:07,533
Whoever's in the cockpit, activate the brake.

1136
01:30:07,866 --> 01:30:09,451
The steering mechanism is stuck.

1137
01:30:09,618 --> 01:30:11,036
Well, pull harder!

1138
01:30:17,084 --> 01:30:17,960
Let's go. Come on.

1139
01:30:38,730 --> 01:30:39,982
It's hard to breathe.

1140
01:30:47,865 --> 01:30:49,908
We're entering space.

1141
01:31:16,226 --> 01:31:17,603
Oh, piss off.

1142
01:31:26,653 --> 01:31:29,489
What kind of monster
slaughters a civilization?

1143
01:31:29,948 --> 01:31:30,949
Where are Mantis and Drax?

1144
01:31:31,074 --> 01:31:32,075
I don't know!

1145
01:31:36,371 --> 01:31:37,581
-Gimme.
-Here.

1146
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,001
You're lucky I was able to...

1147
01:31:41,168 --> 01:31:43,295
-knock down that door...
-Rocket and Gamora are probably dead...

1148
01:31:43,462 --> 01:31:44,505
because of you!

1149
01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:46,507
-I didn't know.
-Oh, you didn't know?

1150
01:31:46,632 --> 01:31:48,300
When are you gonna
stop using the excuse of...

1151
01:31:48,509 --> 01:31:51,094
being some big dumb clown
for contributing nothing...

1152
01:31:51,303 --> 01:31:53,514
and the rest of us having to
carry your slack!

1153
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:54,890
Don't push him!

1154
01:31:54,973 --> 01:31:56,099
You don't have the right to push him.

1155
01:31:56,266 --> 01:31:58,018
And you! You're no better.

1156
01:31:58,143 --> 01:31:59,937
The only thing we can count on you for...

1157
01:32:00,062 --> 01:32:03,023
is when someone shows weakness,
you'll be right there to support it.

1158
01:32:03,148 --> 01:32:04,399
Fine, I don't care.

1159
01:32:04,608 --> 01:32:08,320
I know you need to find fault in
everyone else to make yourself feel okay...

1160
01:32:08,487 --> 01:32:10,948
-so find it in me.
-Oh, go to hell, Mant!

1161
01:32:11,114 --> 01:32:12,908
But you don't have the right to push him!

1162
01:32:13,408 --> 01:32:15,285
It's not his fault he's stupid.

1163
01:32:15,702 --> 01:32:16,537
He's a liability.

1164
01:32:16,703 --> 01:32:20,749
He makes us laugh and he loves us.
How is that a liability?

1165
01:32:21,542 --> 01:32:24,920
All you care about is
intelligence and competence.

1166
01:32:25,045 --> 01:32:27,047
Not sure I appreciate this defense.

1167
01:32:27,172 --> 01:32:28,507
He has sadness...

1168
01:32:28,674 --> 01:32:31,426
but he's the only one of you
who doesn't hate himself.

1169
01:32:31,969 --> 01:32:33,804
So I don't care if he's stupid.

1170
01:32:34,763 --> 01:32:36,014
You think I'm stupid?

1171
01:32:37,266 --> 01:32:38,433
Yes.

1172
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:43,021
Forget.

1173
01:32:46,191 --> 01:32:49,361
You're lucky I was able to knock down
that door with my incredible strength.

1174
01:32:50,571 --> 01:32:51,655
Quill?

1175
01:32:51,864 --> 01:32:53,699
Quill? Quill, are you there?

1176
01:32:57,828 --> 01:33:00,205
That language isn't in my translator.

1177
01:33:10,883 --> 01:33:13,051
Okay. Here we go.

1178
01:33:34,406 --> 01:33:35,908
Okay. All right, Rocket.

1179
01:33:36,742 --> 01:33:37,743
Go.

1180
01:33:55,093 --> 01:33:56,428
Lylla?

1181
01:33:59,056 --> 01:34:00,307
Friend.

1182
01:34:03,352 --> 01:34:04,978
Okay, okay.

1183
01:34:05,145 --> 01:34:06,146
Okay, here we go.

1184
01:34:09,983 --> 01:34:10,943
This isn't right.

1185
01:34:11,818 --> 01:34:14,196
Yeah, no, no, no, it's good.
It's gonna work. It's working.

1186
01:34:14,363 --> 01:34:15,572
It needs to be faster.

1187
01:34:18,158 --> 01:34:20,911
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1188
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:24,081
Rocket.

1189
01:34:24,206 --> 01:34:25,499
I let you down.

1190
01:34:26,375 --> 01:34:30,087
I got you killed.
I got everybody killed.

1191
01:34:30,504 --> 01:34:31,964
We were right.

1192
01:34:32,506 --> 01:34:36,218
The sky is beautiful, and it is forever.

1193
01:34:36,802 --> 01:34:39,680
And I've been flying with our friends.

1194
01:34:53,193 --> 01:34:54,278
Can I come?

1195
01:34:54,903 --> 01:34:56,113
Yes.

1196
01:35:05,706 --> 01:35:06,707
No, no, no!

1197
01:35:07,165 --> 01:35:08,166
No!

1198
01:35:08,292 --> 01:35:09,293
Come on.

1199
01:35:10,127 --> 01:35:11,587
-Come on!
-Quill.

1200
01:35:14,464 --> 01:35:15,966
No!

1201
01:35:16,133 --> 01:35:18,343
No!

1202
01:35:20,554 --> 01:35:21,597
-Quill.
-No!

1203
01:35:22,681 --> 01:35:23,932
-Quill.
-I'm not gonna lose him.

1204
01:35:24,141 --> 01:35:25,142
He's gone.

1205
01:35:25,267 --> 01:35:27,978
I'm not letting him go!

1206
01:35:30,397 --> 01:35:31,398
Come on.

1207
01:35:44,244 --> 01:35:45,454
But not yet.

1208
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:48,498
You still have a purpose here.

1209
01:35:49,166 --> 01:35:50,959
A purpose for what?

1210
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:52,920
They made us for nothing.

1211
01:35:53,086 --> 01:35:55,672
Stupid experiments to be thrown away.

1212
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:58,842
There are the hands that made us...

1213
01:35:58,967 --> 01:36:02,012
and then there are the hands
that guide the hands.

1214
01:36:09,353 --> 01:36:11,313
My beloved raccoon.

1215
01:36:12,314 --> 01:36:15,859
This story has been yours all along,
you just didn't know it.

1216
01:36:19,780 --> 01:36:21,031
I'm not a raccoon.

1217
01:36:28,830 --> 01:36:30,207
The passkey's going through!

1218
01:36:47,808 --> 01:36:48,809
Quill?

1219
01:37:08,161 --> 01:37:09,538
Where's Nebula?

1220
01:37:15,460 --> 01:37:17,045
She's...

1221
01:37:17,963 --> 01:37:20,257
Because her code is on the comm behind you.

1222
01:37:25,637 --> 01:37:26,930
What?
Nebula?

1223
01:37:27,139 --> 01:37:28,974
-Where are you?
-Thank God!

1224
01:37:29,183 --> 01:37:30,350
We're here to get you out of here.

1225
01:37:30,517 --> 01:37:32,060
-Out of where?
-The High Evolutionary's ship.

1226
01:37:32,269 --> 01:37:33,687
No, I got off the ship.

1227
01:37:33,854 --> 01:37:35,105
-You what?
-Wait, where are you?

1228
01:37:35,272 --> 01:37:36,273
On the ship!

1229
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:37,774
-On the ship?
-I didn't lie.

1230
01:37:37,983 --> 01:37:39,193
Why are you on the ship?

1231
01:37:39,318 --> 01:37:40,527
To save you, obviously.

1232
01:37:40,736 --> 01:37:41,737
No, I told you to go back.

1233
01:37:41,945 --> 01:37:45,365
You gotta know by now I always figure out
an incredibly clever way to get out of a fix.

1234
01:37:45,532 --> 01:37:46,617
Tell him I said hi.

1235
01:37:46,867 --> 01:37:49,036
-Really?
-Tell him we're coming to save him.

1236
01:37:49,203 --> 01:37:50,871
Pay attention or play with the kids.

1237
01:37:51,079 --> 01:37:52,164
One or the other.

1238
01:37:52,331 --> 01:37:53,373
"Play with the kids"?

1239
01:37:53,498 --> 01:37:54,666
How did you get out?

1240
01:37:54,833 --> 01:37:55,751
That's not really important.

1241
01:37:55,959 --> 01:37:57,211
I am Groot.

1242
01:37:57,377 --> 01:37:59,755
Jumping a thousand feet to your death
without a parachute...

1243
01:37:59,922 --> 01:38:00,923
is a clever way...

1244
01:38:01,048 --> 01:38:02,591
of getting out of a fix?

1245
01:38:03,008 --> 01:38:04,968
You're all just makin' up
stuff that he's saying, right?

1246
01:38:05,344 --> 01:38:06,470
The important thing is...

1247
01:38:06,678 --> 01:38:08,138
we're all okay.

1248
01:38:11,350 --> 01:38:12,392
Rocket?

1249
01:38:13,435 --> 01:38:14,853
Yeah, he's here.

1250
01:38:15,062 --> 01:38:16,188
And he's okay.

1251
01:38:22,402 --> 01:38:26,490
Rocket, we love you very much,
and we're happy you're alive.

1252
01:38:27,115 --> 01:38:28,617
Well, that makes you the idiots then.

1253
01:38:28,784 --> 01:38:29,952
He's right about that.

1254
01:38:32,204 --> 01:38:33,413
Back in your cages!

1255
01:38:37,793 --> 01:38:38,794
Nebula?

1256
01:38:40,128 --> 01:38:41,463
Nebula, come in!

1257
01:38:46,927 --> 01:38:49,930
So, you'd like to joust, would you?

1258
01:38:51,932 --> 01:38:52,933
Go to hell...

1259
01:38:53,058 --> 01:38:54,393
you sick son of a bitch.

1260
01:38:54,518 --> 01:38:56,061
You killed all of those people.

1261
01:38:56,186 --> 01:38:58,063
As I will your friends.

1262
01:38:58,564 --> 01:39:00,607
I'm sending you the coordinates.

1263
01:39:00,774 --> 01:39:03,360
They will die unless you bring me...

1264
01:39:03,485 --> 01:39:04,486
what is mine!

1265
01:39:04,611 --> 01:39:08,574
Screw you,
you stretch-faced, RoboCop-looking...

1266
01:39:08,699 --> 01:39:10,117
Skeletor wannabe...

1267
01:39:10,325 --> 01:39:12,286
purple-nurple piece of...

1268
01:39:15,414 --> 01:39:16,540
He hung up.

1269
01:39:19,376 --> 01:39:20,419
You think?

1270
01:39:23,714 --> 01:39:25,340
1966.

1271
01:39:25,424 --> 01:39:28,093
The Soviet put me on a rocket...

1272
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:31,221
knowing full well I'm never to return
and I will die...

1273
01:39:31,388 --> 01:39:33,140
in a fiery ball of death.

1274
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:36,393
But one thing even mudak Soviets never do...

1275
01:39:36,518 --> 01:39:38,645
is call me bad dog.

1276
01:39:38,812 --> 01:39:41,148
Oh, my God! Could you just let it go?

1277
01:39:41,315 --> 01:39:45,319
Kraglin, please, just take it back.
This is killing us.

1278
01:39:45,444 --> 01:39:48,322
I can't take it back if she is, in fact...

1279
01:39:48,739 --> 01:39:49,740
a bad dog.

1280
01:39:50,782 --> 01:39:53,368
-Kraglin!
-It never stops hurting.

1281
01:39:53,702 --> 01:39:54,953
Kraglin.

1282
01:39:55,621 --> 01:39:56,663
Oh, hey, Pete.

1283
01:39:56,830 --> 01:40:00,501
We need to save Nebula, Mantis, and Drax,
and we need your help.

1284
01:40:00,667 --> 01:40:01,835
Me?

1285
01:40:05,255 --> 01:40:07,090
You're the one who lost it, you twit.

1286
01:40:07,216 --> 01:40:09,259
The Hellspawn had it, sire, but...

1287
01:40:09,426 --> 01:40:10,385
But, but, but!

1288
01:40:10,511 --> 01:40:11,803
But!

1289
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:15,474
That rancid word.

1290
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:21,188
I'm merely wondering
whether it might be wiser...

1291
01:40:21,355 --> 01:40:24,358
to go directly to the new colony
and not engage in unnecessary conflict.

1292
01:40:24,525 --> 01:40:28,237
They can rewire a carbenetrix core
in under two minutes...

1293
01:40:28,403 --> 01:40:29,655
but what is that, Vim?

1294
01:40:30,489 --> 01:40:31,490
Rote memorization.

1295
01:40:31,657 --> 01:40:33,408
Rote memorization!

1296
01:40:34,368 --> 01:40:36,245
In hundreds of years of our creations...

1297
01:40:36,370 --> 01:40:39,456
only one has known true invention.

1298
01:40:39,581 --> 01:40:40,582
One.

1299
01:40:42,459 --> 01:40:47,381
Putrid in every other way,
but 89P13 had that.

1300
01:40:50,217 --> 01:40:51,260
Yes, sire.

1301
01:40:52,261 --> 01:40:56,473
A populace unable to think
what hasn't yet been thought...

1302
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:58,183
will die on the vine.

1303
01:40:58,350 --> 01:41:01,603
We need 89P13's brain...

1304
01:41:01,770 --> 01:41:05,232
so we can transfer that trait
into these creatures...

1305
01:41:05,399 --> 01:41:07,317
before we go to the new colony.

1306
01:41:07,484 --> 01:41:09,528
Nothing else matters.

1307
01:41:29,548 --> 01:41:31,091
How did they get down here?

1308
01:41:33,927 --> 01:41:36,263
Peter will be trying to get to the spaceport.

1309
01:41:36,805 --> 01:41:38,390
He doesn't know about the children.

1310
01:41:38,849 --> 01:41:39,892
You!

1311
01:41:41,101 --> 01:41:43,604
We need you to let all the other children
on board know...

1312
01:41:43,770 --> 01:41:45,397
to stay away from the starboard walls.

1313
01:41:48,317 --> 01:41:49,318
They know three frickin' words...

1314
01:41:49,484 --> 01:41:50,903
and two of them are "joob."

1315
01:41:52,196 --> 01:41:54,156
No! Listen to me!

1316
01:41:54,781 --> 01:41:57,159
You need to talk to the other children...

1317
01:41:57,326 --> 01:41:59,870
all of them here, and tell them...

1318
01:42:00,078 --> 01:42:01,997
to stay away from the freaking...

1319
01:42:02,206 --> 01:42:03,707
What the hell are you doing, Mantis?

1320
01:42:03,874 --> 01:42:06,502
Explaining it, dickhead!

1321
01:42:17,429 --> 01:42:18,805
You're scaring them.

1322
01:42:24,853 --> 01:42:26,313
Hello, dumb idiots.

1323
01:42:30,817 --> 01:42:32,152
I had a little girl like you.

1324
01:42:32,861 --> 01:42:34,571
You know what she used to like?

1325
01:42:34,988 --> 01:42:36,990
She liked when I made monkey noises.

1326
01:42:47,668 --> 01:42:48,961
How is that a monkey?

1327
01:42:50,045 --> 01:42:51,213
Beats me.

1328
01:43:26,832 --> 01:43:27,833
Yeah.

1329
01:43:29,084 --> 01:43:30,210
Yeah.

1330
01:43:32,754 --> 01:43:34,965
They're gonna tell the other kids
to stay away from the starboard wall.

1331
01:43:35,215 --> 01:43:38,010
Why didn't you tell us
you knew their language this whole time?

1332
01:43:38,468 --> 01:43:39,845
Why didn't you ask?

1333
01:43:42,347 --> 01:43:45,893
This could be futile, Quill.
He's too powerful.

1334
01:43:46,059 --> 01:43:47,769
Well, then I guess we'll die trying.

1335
01:43:47,936 --> 01:43:50,439
What is "dying trying" gonna accomplish?

1336
01:43:50,606 --> 01:43:52,065
Or we can just give him the badger?

1337
01:43:52,274 --> 01:43:54,735
Our thing is dying trying.

1338
01:43:54,943 --> 01:43:55,903
I am Groot.

1339
01:43:56,111 --> 01:43:57,696
I know who you are already!

1340
01:43:58,322 --> 01:44:00,532
Feel free to stay behind in the cargo area.

1341
01:44:00,657 --> 01:44:03,577
I'm not leaving my sister with that jackass.

1342
01:44:03,744 --> 01:44:04,870
This you?

1343
01:44:05,037 --> 01:44:06,663
Fell out of your bag.

1344
01:44:08,749 --> 01:44:09,958
Let's do this.

1345
01:44:46,870 --> 01:44:48,288
Wait.

1346
01:44:49,915 --> 01:44:50,916
Wait.

1347
01:44:51,083 --> 01:44:54,545
Reading some old letters
You smile...

1348
01:44:57,130 --> 01:44:59,383
You almost have to admire their pluck.

1349
01:45:00,509 --> 01:45:01,510
Sire.

1350
01:45:12,521 --> 01:45:14,606
Howdy there, you freakin' creep.

1351
01:45:19,069 --> 01:45:20,863
-Back up!
-Yes, sire.

1352
01:45:23,323 --> 01:45:24,700
You're on, Steemie.

1353
01:45:25,534 --> 01:45:26,618
First barrel.

1354
01:45:28,579 --> 01:45:29,830
Second barrel.

1355
01:45:30,914 --> 01:45:32,207
Third barrel.

1356
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:33,542
Fourth barrel.

1357
01:45:42,009 --> 01:45:43,677
Hard starboard.

1358
01:45:43,844 --> 01:45:44,845
Hard starboard.

1359
01:45:50,976 --> 01:45:52,603
And fire!

1360
01:46:00,986 --> 01:46:02,237
They've breached the spaceport.

1361
01:46:02,446 --> 01:46:04,823
One of them holds subject 89P13.

1362
01:46:04,990 --> 01:46:06,617
Release the Hellspawn.
All of them.

1363
01:46:06,783 --> 01:46:09,578
Sire, the Hellspawn were created
solely to defend the new colony...

1364
01:46:09,745 --> 01:46:11,079
Do it now!

1365
01:46:11,246 --> 01:46:12,831
Get me 89P13...

1366
01:46:12,956 --> 01:46:16,210
and kill everyone
in the head of that dead god.

1367
01:46:54,498 --> 01:46:56,041
Spaceport wide open, Cap'n...

1368
01:46:56,208 --> 01:46:57,876
but that old missile's all we had.

1369
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:01,421
Rocket, Groot, go, go!
Get inside that spaceport.

1370
01:47:15,227 --> 01:47:16,478
What the hell?

1371
01:47:31,034 --> 01:47:32,953
Aw, come on!

1372
01:48:02,566 --> 01:48:04,818
Kraglin, we have been infiltrated.

1373
01:48:07,154 --> 01:48:08,488
Open the pit.

1374
01:48:08,655 --> 01:48:11,200
Sire, our bargaining power will be gone.

1375
01:48:36,391 --> 01:48:37,392
Abilisks!

1376
01:48:45,192 --> 01:48:46,360
Good God!

1377
01:48:52,950 --> 01:48:53,992
This way!

1378
01:50:00,017 --> 01:50:01,977
One more step and this weird thing gets it!

1379
01:50:02,102 --> 01:50:02,936
Don't be rash.

1380
01:50:21,955 --> 01:50:23,332
What were you programming?

1381
01:50:23,498 --> 01:50:24,791
A self-destruction code.

1382
01:50:42,851 --> 01:50:44,061
What are you doing?

1383
01:50:47,314 --> 01:50:48,315
It's okay.

1384
01:50:48,440 --> 01:50:49,650
Mantis, stop!

1385
01:50:52,069 --> 01:50:53,153
They eat batteries...

1386
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:54,571
not people.

1387
01:50:56,073 --> 01:50:59,535
Maybe they're just scared
of what we are gonna do to them.

1388
01:51:06,375 --> 01:51:08,126
We're not gonna hurt you.

1389
01:51:11,171 --> 01:51:13,173
Everything is going to be okay.

1390
01:52:08,812 --> 01:52:10,147
Use your heart, boy.

1391
01:53:01,532 --> 01:53:02,574
A dog!

1392
01:53:02,783 --> 01:53:03,951
Yeah.

1393
01:53:12,292 --> 01:53:14,336
She's a good dog.

1394
01:53:18,674 --> 01:53:20,843
I knew you believe I am good dog.

1395
01:53:21,009 --> 01:53:22,845
All right, all right, get off me, you idiot!

1396
01:53:26,807 --> 01:53:29,476
Sire, we must retreat.
The ship is going down.

1397
01:53:29,643 --> 01:53:31,228
The spaceport has intruders.

1398
01:53:31,478 --> 01:53:34,189
Go! See if one of them is 89P13.

1399
01:53:34,314 --> 01:53:36,400
Sire, you have an irrational obsession
with this animal.

1400
01:53:36,567 --> 01:53:37,943
You must stop, for God's sake!

1401
01:53:38,110 --> 01:53:39,778
There is no God!

1402
01:53:39,987 --> 01:53:42,155
That's why I stepped in!

1403
01:54:10,642 --> 01:54:15,022
Controller, I am taking command of the Arête.

1404
01:54:15,189 --> 01:54:19,610
Disengage all damaged sectors of the ship...

1405
01:54:20,027 --> 01:54:21,904
and retreat.

1406
01:54:47,137 --> 01:54:48,138
Attention...

1407
01:54:48,263 --> 01:54:49,556
all personnel.

1408
01:54:50,933 --> 01:54:53,977
Intruders have boarded the ship.

1409
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:57,105
Head to the starboard spaceport.

1410
01:54:59,525 --> 01:55:01,944
Get me 89P13...

1411
01:55:03,153 --> 01:55:04,613
and kill the rest.

1412
01:55:14,122 --> 01:55:15,541
We go in there, we get Mantis...

1413
01:55:15,707 --> 01:55:17,167
Nebula, and Drax.

1414
01:55:17,334 --> 01:55:20,212
We move in, we get 'em, and we get out.

1415
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:41,108
Did that look cool?

1416
01:55:41,733 --> 01:55:45,487
Okay, new game plan.
We get the hell out of here now.

1417
01:55:45,612 --> 01:55:47,114
There are thousands of creatures on the ship.

1418
01:55:47,281 --> 01:55:48,615
Many of them are children.

1419
01:55:48,740 --> 01:55:50,075
And we need to be good joob joob.

1420
01:55:51,743 --> 01:55:52,953
It means friends.

1421
01:55:53,871 --> 01:55:56,290
If we wanna live, we have to leave now.

1422
01:55:56,832 --> 01:55:59,168
This whole rig is gonna go down any second.

1423
01:55:59,334 --> 01:56:01,628
They will all die if we don't help them.

1424
01:56:09,011 --> 01:56:10,721
I'm done runnin'.

1425
01:59:13,904 --> 01:59:15,364
There's a big hole up in the deck.

1426
01:59:15,531 --> 01:59:18,534
If we can connect that to Knowhere,
we can lead the survivors to safety.

1427
01:59:18,659 --> 01:59:22,621
Nebs and me will pilot the ship.
You guys save all the higher life forms.

1428
01:59:33,173 --> 01:59:34,174
Hello, moron.

1429
01:59:37,302 --> 01:59:38,303
Come on!

1430
01:59:40,222 --> 01:59:41,640
Follow me, come on! Come on!

1431
01:59:43,225 --> 01:59:44,059
Come on!

1432
01:59:45,185 --> 01:59:46,645
Go, go, go!

1433
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:49,565
I am Groot!

1434
02:00:07,541 --> 02:00:09,001
This way to...

1435
02:00:09,751 --> 02:00:11,211
Thank you.

1436
02:00:11,378 --> 02:00:13,505
Yes, you're welcome. I was screaming at...

1437
02:00:13,630 --> 02:00:15,090
something scary behind you, not you.

1438
02:00:15,299 --> 02:00:17,634
You look really cool.

1439
02:00:22,556 --> 02:00:24,683
Kill me if you want,
but then good luck gettin' out of here.

1440
02:00:29,021 --> 02:00:30,022
-Wait!
-Let him go, Flecktick...

1441
02:00:30,189 --> 02:00:31,106
it's our only chance.

1442
02:00:31,273 --> 02:00:32,441
I got a space big enough to get through.

1443
02:00:32,608 --> 02:00:35,444
I gotta find out if I can change it
to a permeable shield.

1444
02:00:41,783 --> 02:00:43,243
I can't fly this frickin' thing...

1445
02:00:43,410 --> 02:00:45,078
the flight controls are all screwed.

1446
02:00:45,329 --> 02:00:46,455
I'll do it.

1447
02:00:46,622 --> 02:00:48,707
Go help the others. Wait, give me your comm.

1448
02:00:57,007 --> 02:00:59,676
Kraglin, I'll pilot from this side.

1449
02:01:00,594 --> 02:01:01,595
Kragula...

1450
02:01:01,720 --> 02:01:03,722
back in action!

1451
02:01:29,831 --> 02:01:31,333
Come on, come on, come on!

1452
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:32,501
Go, go!

1453
02:01:32,668 --> 02:01:33,961
Go, go, go!

1454
02:01:35,462 --> 02:01:36,463
Wait, wait, wait!

1455
02:01:36,630 --> 02:01:37,756
Stop, stop!

1456
02:01:37,881 --> 02:01:39,550
Are those kids?

1457
02:01:56,316 --> 02:01:57,776
Okay, Cosmo, stitch it up!

1458
02:01:57,860 --> 02:02:00,153
It needs to be airtight
for the kids to make it across.

1459
02:02:00,404 --> 02:02:02,030
Locking up, Kapitan.

1460
02:02:11,039 --> 02:02:12,666
Go, now, go!

1461
02:02:17,212 --> 02:02:19,047
One by one, one by one!

1462
02:02:19,256 --> 02:02:20,591
Okay.

1463
02:02:26,638 --> 02:02:28,932
Locking in and headed down.

1464
02:02:35,230 --> 02:02:36,982
This way. This way.

1465
02:02:40,694 --> 02:02:41,695
Why?

1466
02:02:43,780 --> 02:02:46,033
Why are you doing this? I tried to kill you.

1467
02:02:46,909 --> 02:02:49,077
I am Groot.

1468
02:02:49,912 --> 02:02:50,996
He says...

1469
02:02:51,163 --> 02:02:53,207
"everyone deserves a second chance."

1470
02:03:04,384 --> 02:03:06,595
You are so strong.

1471
02:03:11,308 --> 02:03:13,477
Why are you so slow? Hurry!

1472
02:03:14,645 --> 02:03:15,896
Where's Rocket?

1473
02:05:45,379 --> 02:05:46,380
You!

1474
02:05:48,048 --> 02:05:50,008
You thought you could escape me!

1475
02:05:50,843 --> 02:05:51,802
No!

1476
02:05:54,096 --> 02:05:57,850
You think you have some worth
in and of yourself, without me?

1477
02:05:58,016 --> 02:05:59,017
No!

1478
02:06:00,853 --> 02:06:02,396
You are an abomination!

1479
02:06:02,604 --> 02:06:05,774
Nothing more than a step on my path...

1480
02:06:05,941 --> 02:06:08,151
you freakish little monster!

1481
02:06:08,318 --> 02:06:10,404
How dare you think you are more...

1482
02:06:11,446 --> 02:06:15,075
89P13?

1483
02:06:18,537 --> 02:06:19,746
The name's Rocket.

1484
02:06:20,664 --> 02:06:23,041
Rocket Raccoon.

1485
02:07:03,207 --> 02:07:04,333
His face came off!

1486
02:07:04,875 --> 02:07:05,834
It's a mask.

1487
02:07:06,627 --> 02:07:07,628
Look...

1488
02:07:07,794 --> 02:07:10,130
what you did to me.

1489
02:07:10,923 --> 02:07:12,341
For what?

1490
02:07:12,508 --> 02:07:14,635
All I wanted to do...

1491
02:07:15,052 --> 02:07:16,762
was to make things...

1492
02:07:17,387 --> 02:07:18,472
perfect.

1493
02:07:19,306 --> 02:07:21,433
You didn't wanna make things perfect.

1494
02:07:21,683 --> 02:07:24,061
You just hated things the way they are.

1495
02:07:24,394 --> 02:07:25,479
Kill him.

1496
02:07:32,194 --> 02:07:33,195
Why?

1497
02:07:33,987 --> 02:07:36,949
Because I'm a freaking
Guardian of the Galaxy.

1498
02:07:38,116 --> 02:07:40,494
We have to get outta here now.

1499
02:07:40,702 --> 02:07:41,662
We have to save them.

1500
02:07:41,828 --> 02:07:42,913
We've got all the kids on board.

1501
02:07:43,080 --> 02:07:43,956
No, Pete.

1502
02:07:44,790 --> 02:07:46,333
The rest of them.

1503
02:07:52,172 --> 02:07:54,299
Come on! Come on. Whoa!

1504
02:07:54,716 --> 02:07:55,801
Move!

1505
02:07:56,009 --> 02:07:57,427
Move it, bird!

1506
02:07:57,845 --> 02:07:59,221
-Whoa!
-Come on!

1507
02:08:02,808 --> 02:08:03,809
Come on!

1508
02:08:04,434 --> 02:08:05,435
Come on, come on, come on!

1509
02:08:08,939 --> 02:08:11,108
Thought we were limiting ourselves
to the higher life forms?

1510
02:08:11,233 --> 02:08:13,151
Yeah, well, me too.

1511
02:08:13,318 --> 02:08:15,445
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1512
02:08:21,493 --> 02:08:22,536
Go, babies.

1513
02:08:22,744 --> 02:08:23,871
Go, babies.

1514
02:08:24,037 --> 02:08:25,497
Go!

1515
02:08:25,664 --> 02:08:27,833
I cannot hold much...

1516
02:08:34,590 --> 02:08:35,591
Run!

1517
02:08:35,799 --> 02:08:36,925
Go! Go!

1518
02:08:48,395 --> 02:08:49,354
Quill!

1519
02:08:49,521 --> 02:08:50,564
Hurry!

1520
02:09:33,607 --> 02:09:36,151
Peter!

1521
02:10:43,677 --> 02:10:44,678
Peter!

1522
02:10:49,892 --> 02:10:51,810
Did that...

1523
02:10:51,977 --> 02:10:53,437
look...

1524
02:10:54,146 --> 02:10:55,439
cool?

1525
02:10:58,734 --> 02:10:59,610
Come on.

1526
02:11:12,206 --> 02:11:14,750
Cosmo! I'm okay.

1527
02:11:52,663 --> 02:11:54,164
I am Groot.

1528
02:11:54,790 --> 02:11:57,209
Thanks. Just tell them I'm gonna be right...

1529
02:12:02,756 --> 02:12:04,216
I am Groot.

1530
02:12:06,051 --> 02:12:08,762
Yeah. It was good working with you, too.

1531
02:12:16,562 --> 02:12:17,563
Hey, Gamora.

1532
02:12:18,105 --> 02:12:19,106
Are you ready?

1533
02:12:19,690 --> 02:12:20,858
Yeah.

1534
02:12:27,114 --> 02:12:28,657
You know, I'm still not
who you want me to be.

1535
02:12:30,701 --> 02:12:31,702
I know.

1536
02:12:33,078 --> 02:12:35,205
But who you are ain't so bad.

1537
02:12:55,142 --> 02:12:56,810
I bet we were fun.

1538
02:13:02,107 --> 02:13:03,859
Like you wouldn't believe.

1539
02:13:10,407 --> 02:13:11,450
Okay.

1540
02:13:25,380 --> 02:13:26,798
You okay?

1541
02:13:28,717 --> 02:13:30,886
I think I need to talk to everybody.

1542
02:13:33,013 --> 02:13:35,224
So, you're gonna leave?

1543
02:13:36,808 --> 02:13:38,769
My mother died in front of me
when I was eight years old...

1544
02:13:39,019 --> 02:13:41,146
and I have been running ever since.

1545
02:13:42,356 --> 02:13:44,358
I'm gonna need to take some time...

1546
02:13:46,443 --> 02:13:47,861
and learn how to swim.

1547
02:13:50,739 --> 02:13:51,740
I as well.

1548
02:13:56,328 --> 02:13:59,248
I love you all. I do.

1549
02:14:03,418 --> 02:14:06,547
But my whole life
I did whatever Ego wanted...

1550
02:14:07,047 --> 02:14:09,800
and then, I did
whatever the Guardians wanted.

1551
02:14:10,592 --> 02:14:13,846
I need to go out and discover what I want.

1552
02:14:14,012 --> 02:14:14,972
I'll come with you.

1553
02:14:15,138 --> 02:14:17,516
No, Drax. That's the whole point.

1554
02:14:17,683 --> 02:14:19,059
But you need someone to protect you.

1555
02:14:19,184 --> 02:14:21,228
-I don't.
-Not in a bad way.

1556
02:14:21,353 --> 02:14:22,688
Just because of your incredible weakness.

1557
02:14:22,896 --> 02:14:24,439
Oh, my gosh, you're so frustrating!

1558
02:14:24,565 --> 02:14:25,566
Drax.

1559
02:14:26,316 --> 02:14:27,484
I need you here.

1560
02:14:28,318 --> 02:14:29,695
We're building a new society.

1561
02:14:30,445 --> 02:14:33,031
I need all the support I can get
for those children out there.

1562
02:14:34,283 --> 02:14:36,827
Today, I saw who you are.

1563
02:14:38,036 --> 02:14:39,830
You weren't born to be a destroyer.

1564
02:14:41,790 --> 02:14:43,166
You were born to be a dad.

1565
02:14:47,671 --> 02:14:49,631
So, you'll lead the Guardians then?

1566
02:14:50,340 --> 02:14:51,341
No.

1567
02:14:51,842 --> 02:14:53,427
I'm gonna lead the city...

1568
02:14:54,178 --> 02:14:55,846
make it the type of home I never had.

1569
02:14:58,640 --> 02:14:59,892
So, that's it?

1570
02:15:01,476 --> 02:15:02,895
The group's over?

1571
02:15:03,478 --> 02:15:04,605
No.

1572
02:15:04,897 --> 02:15:07,107
Well, the Galaxy still needs its Guardians.

1573
02:15:08,275 --> 02:15:11,028
And you will make a better leader
than I ever was...

1574
02:15:11,862 --> 02:15:12,863
Cap'n.

1575
02:15:33,300 --> 02:15:35,052
I love you, guys.

1576
02:15:43,143 --> 02:15:44,228
For you.

1577
02:17:40,385 --> 02:17:41,637
Yeah!

1578
02:17:41,762 --> 02:17:43,055
Oh, yeah!

1579
02:17:48,268 --> 02:17:49,686
Welcome home.

1580
02:18:37,860 --> 02:18:39,486
I think I might be at the wrong...

1581
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:42,823
I'm looking for Jason Quill.

1582
02:18:42,948 --> 02:18:44,074
Yes.

1583
02:18:44,616 --> 02:18:45,826
Come in.

1584
02:19:03,969 --> 02:19:04,970
Pete?

1585
02:19:11,435 --> 02:19:12,436
Pete.

1586
02:19:17,024 --> 02:19:18,275
Hi, Grandpa.

1587
02:19:47,179 --> 02:19:50,140
Yes! Yes! Yeah! Yeah!

1588
02:19:54,186 --> 02:19:55,479
Yeah!

1589
02:19:55,646 --> 02:19:57,147
Yeah!

1590
02:21:21,648 --> 02:21:23,525
Okay, how about your favorite musical act?

1591
02:21:24,109 --> 02:21:25,194
Phyla, you first.

1592
02:21:26,904 --> 02:21:29,781
Britney Spears and Korn.

1593
02:21:30,115 --> 02:21:31,116
Good choices.

1594
02:21:31,283 --> 02:21:33,952
I gotta go with the man. Garth Brooks.

1595
02:21:34,077 --> 02:21:37,206
The Carpenters do not have a single bad song.

1596
02:21:37,372 --> 02:21:38,665
Adrian Belew.

1597
02:21:38,957 --> 02:21:42,169
Both solo and his work with King Crimson.

1598
02:21:42,961 --> 02:21:44,505
What about you, Captain?

1599
02:21:44,671 --> 02:21:46,215
This one's kind of special.

1600
02:22:04,191 --> 02:22:05,651
Guess they're here.

1601
02:22:05,859 --> 02:22:09,571
Well, I can handle this by my lonesome...

1602
02:22:09,738 --> 02:22:11,323
if y'all wanna chill.

1603
02:22:11,490 --> 02:22:12,533
Nah, nah.

1604
02:22:12,658 --> 02:22:16,036
It'll go faster if we all do it together.
Groot, wake up.

1605
02:22:27,339 --> 02:22:29,174
Do you ever feel a little sad for them?

1606
02:22:29,299 --> 02:22:32,427
Yeah, sure.
But these townsfolk can't protect themselves.

1607
02:22:33,220 --> 02:22:34,888
On your word, Kapitan.

1608
02:22:44,815 --> 02:22:45,732
Word.

02:29:12,494 --> 02:29:14,496
I mean, if she needs help mowing her lawn,
I'll do it...

1610
02:29:14,663 --> 02:29:16,331
but I kinda feel like her son should help.

1611
02:29:16,915 --> 02:29:19,126
He's gonna sit on the porch
and watch me do it.

1612
02:29:19,418 --> 02:29:21,211
Like, he's a 45-year-old man...

1613
02:29:21,378 --> 02:29:23,213
able-bodied, and I'm mowing his lawn.

1614
02:29:23,380 --> 02:29:24,506
It just feels weird.

1615
02:29:24,673 --> 02:29:26,175
Don't get me started.

1616
02:29:27,885 --> 02:29:28,844
Oh, really?

1617
02:29:30,554 --> 02:29:31,847
Now I kind of want to know.
