enter the domain

179
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:36,665
of Zachary Beaver, possible
the fattest boy in the world.

180
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:36,665
of Zachary Beaver, possible
the fattest boy in the world.

181
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,667
Four-hundred and
forty-three pounds.

182
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,169
Now, you don't have to rush,
but no dawdling, please.

183
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,169
Now, you don't have to rush,
but no dawdling, please.

184
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,838
In the tradition, I'll be
happy to take your questions.

185
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,715
-And your money.

186
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,715
-And your money.

187
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,052
Oh, by the way, could you lend
me the five bucks?

188
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:50,887
-Add it to your tab.

189
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:50,887
-Add it to your tab.

190
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,639
(sarcastic)
Ha, ha, ha.

191
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,641
-Is that another letter
from Wayne?

192
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,602
-Oh, yeah. Here.

193
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,602
-Oh, yeah. Here.

194
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,813
-Let's see.

195
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,150
-Its so weird-- he can't email
when he's on a mission.

196
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,819
Ever write him back yet?

197
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,819
Ever write him back yet?

198
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,779
-No, not yet.

199
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,781
-Man, do you think
Intelligence checked this

200
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,157
to see what he wrote?

201
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,157
to see what he wrote?

202
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,743
-Intelligence?
It doesn't matter.

203
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,620
I mean, he sails halfway
around the world

204
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,620
I mean, he sails halfway
around the world

205
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,913
and then he writes back about

206
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,123
'excitement central' here

207
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,082
like it's the greatest
place on earth.

208
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,082
like it's the greatest
place on earth.

209
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,752
-Whew! Makes you think,
don't it?

210
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,713
-It certainly does.
It certainly does.

211
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,631
-Here, and her.

212
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,631
-Here, and her.

213
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,966
-Mm-hey--

214
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,843
Sh-- She doesn't gotta go to the
bathroom, does she?

215
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,136
-Do you?

216
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,136
-Do you?

217
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,220
-Okay.

218
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,306
-She better not, or else.

219
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,833
-She better not, or else.

220
00:08:38,961 --> 00:08:41,590
(gasps)

221
00:08:53,185 --> 00:08:55,395
-How much do you eat?

222
00:08:53,185 --> 00:08:55,395
-How much do you eat?

223
00:08:55,395 --> 00:08:56,938
-As much as I can.

224
00:08:56,938 --> 00:08:58,899
-How old are you?

225
00:08:56,938 --> 00:08:58,899
-How old are you?

226
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:00,275
-Old enough.

227
00:09:00,275 --> 00:09:01,818
-Where do you go to school?

228
00:09:01,818 --> 00:09:03,779
-You're looking at it.

229
00:09:01,818 --> 00:09:03,779
-You're looking at it.

230
00:09:13,205 --> 00:09:15,373
-What's in this gold box?

231
00:09:13,205 --> 00:09:15,373
-What's in this gold box?

232
00:09:17,751 --> 00:09:19,461
-Do I smell pee?

233
00:09:17,751 --> 00:09:19,461
-Do I smell pee?

234
00:09:19,461 --> 00:09:20,378
-Gee!

235
00:09:20,378 --> 00:09:22,672
(angrily) Did that kid
just pee in here?

236
00:09:22,672 --> 00:09:24,883
(shouting, angrily)
Get her out of here.

237
00:09:22,672 --> 00:09:24,883
(shouting, angrily)
Get her out of here.

238
00:09:26,676 --> 00:09:28,386
-Here, home. Go change.

239
00:09:26,676 --> 00:09:28,386
-Here, home. Go change.

240
00:09:28,386 --> 00:09:31,306
-He was so fat!

241
00:09:31,848 --> 00:09:33,725
-Hey, man, I didn't
know you babysat.

242
00:09:31,848 --> 00:09:33,725
-Hey, man, I didn't
know you babysat.

243
00:09:33,725 --> 00:09:35,310
(Scarlet laughs)

244
00:09:47,197 --> 00:09:49,115
-Oh, my God.

245
00:09:47,197 --> 00:09:49,115
-Oh, my God.

246
00:09:49,115 --> 00:09:52,994
-Come on, your mom
never lets me cook.

247
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:55,247
I'm goin' all out while I can.

248
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:55,247
I'm goin' all out while I can.

249
00:09:55,247 --> 00:09:57,457
Where's the-- Oh.

250
00:09:57,457 --> 00:10:00,001
This came for you.

251
00:09:57,457 --> 00:10:00,001
This came for you.

252
00:10:00,752 --> 00:10:02,087
-What's this?

253
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:03,380
-I think it's the...

254
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:03,380
-I think it's the...

255
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,383
contact lenses your mother
ordered for you.

256
00:10:07,425 --> 00:10:12,764
Hungry? It's Manwich flambe.

257
00:10:07,425 --> 00:10:12,764
Hungry? It's Manwich flambe.

258
00:10:13,306 --> 00:10:14,975
(belches)

259
00:10:13,306 --> 00:10:14,975
(belches)

260
00:10:14,975 --> 00:10:16,935
-One more.
-Give it a rest.

261
00:10:16,935 --> 00:10:19,145
-One more, come on.

262
00:10:16,935 --> 00:10:19,145
-One more, come on.

263
00:10:19,145 --> 00:10:20,354
-No.
-Stupid loser.

264
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:23,024
-Just come out here and have a
smoke, for Christ's sake.

265
00:10:23,024 --> 00:10:24,192
Can I just come out here--

266
00:10:23,024 --> 00:10:24,192
Can I just come out here--

267
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:25,193
-One more.
-No more.

268
00:10:25,193 --> 00:10:26,945
Forget it.
No more Boggle.

269
00:10:26,945 --> 00:10:29,030
-Well, what else do
you wanna play?

270
00:10:26,945 --> 00:10:29,030
-Well, what else do
you wanna play?

271
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,116
Paulie, come on.

272
00:10:31,116 --> 00:10:35,120
Hey, Paulie! Come back!
Come on!

273
00:10:31,116 --> 00:10:35,120
Hey, Paulie! Come back!
Come on!

274
00:10:35,453 --> 00:10:37,205
Paulie.

275
00:10:38,415 --> 00:10:42,335
(indistinctx conversation)

276
00:10:45,922 --> 00:10:47,299
-You won't be able to
get your license

277
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:49,009
if you can't learn to park.

278
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:49,009
if you can't learn to park.

279
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:50,468
-Oh, be quiet!

280
00:10:51,094 --> 00:10:57,225
-AH! OH!
She hit me.

281
00:10:51,094 --> 00:10:57,225
-AH! OH!
She hit me.

282
00:10:57,642 --> 00:11:00,103
I'm hit.

283
00:10:57,642 --> 00:11:00,103
I'm hit.

284
00:11:00,645 --> 00:11:04,649
-Cal. Cal.

285
00:11:00,645 --> 00:11:04,649
-Cal. Cal.

286
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:06,902
You boys come here a minute?

287
00:11:24,461 --> 00:11:26,212
-You know, ladybugs are
comin' in a few days

288
00:11:26,212 --> 00:11:27,589
and we're gonna need some
help,

289
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:29,591
with Wayne gone-- from both of
you. All right?

290
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:29,591
with Wayne gone-- from both of
you. All right?

291
00:11:29,591 --> 00:11:31,509
-Sure, mom.

292
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:33,345
-We need 'em for the cotton
crop.

293
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:33,345
-We need 'em for the cotton
crop.

294
00:11:33,345 --> 00:11:34,971
They're nature's pesticide.

295
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:37,265
(tires squeak)

296
00:11:37,265 --> 00:11:38,767
-Kate!

297
00:11:37,265 --> 00:11:38,767
-Kate!

298
00:11:38,767 --> 00:11:41,478
-Why don't you boys give
her some space?

299
00:11:41,478 --> 00:11:44,397
Go away... now.

300
00:11:41,478 --> 00:11:44,397
Go away... now.

301
00:11:45,273 --> 00:11:46,733
-What do you want to do?

302
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:49,319
-I don't know. What
do you want to do?

303
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:49,319
-I don't know. What
do you want to do?

304
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:53,239
-I don't know.
There's nothing to do.

305
00:12:05,794 --> 00:12:07,712
-You think
he's still there?

306
00:12:07,712 --> 00:12:10,340
I mean, you know, the fat kid?

307
00:12:07,712 --> 00:12:10,340
I mean, you know, the fat kid?

308
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,385
(sighs) Na, it's too hot.
He'd melt.

309
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,385
(sighs) Na, it's too hot.
He'd melt.

310
00:12:13,677 --> 00:12:15,220
-You really think he
weighs four hundred

311
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,096
and forty-three pounds?

312
00:12:16,096 --> 00:12:17,847
-I don't know. That's
what they said.

313
00:12:17,847 --> 00:12:20,100
-How do you think
they weigh him?

314
00:12:17,847 --> 00:12:20,100
-How do you think
they weigh him?

315
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,477
Most scales don't
even go that high.

316
00:12:22,477 --> 00:12:23,770
(snickers) Maybe at
the meat market.

317
00:12:22,477 --> 00:12:23,770
(snickers) Maybe at
the meat market.

318
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,314
-Ohh, how do you think
he goes to the bathroom?

319
00:12:26,314 --> 00:12:27,190
-Nasty!

320
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,317
-You're such a little girl.
(chuckles)

321
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,317
-You're such a little girl.
(chuckles)

322
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,278
-Well, you are.

323
00:12:32,654 --> 00:12:34,656
-I'm hungry. Come on,
let's go eat.

324
00:12:32,654 --> 00:12:34,656
-I'm hungry. Come on,
let's go eat.

325
00:12:40,161 --> 00:12:41,454
-Think it's safe
to go in here

326
00:12:41,454 --> 00:12:42,539
without your mom working?

327
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:44,290
-Yeah.

328
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:44,290
-Yeah.

329
00:12:51,547 --> 00:12:53,340
-Hi, Ferris.

330
00:12:51,547 --> 00:12:53,340
-Hi, Ferris.

331
00:12:53,883 --> 00:12:55,593
-Is your mom back yet?

332
00:12:55,927 --> 00:12:57,679
-She just left yesterday.

333
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,806
-Oh. Tell her to
hurry back.

334
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,806
-Oh. Tell her to
hurry back.

335
00:12:59,806 --> 00:13:03,226
She's the people-person
around here, you know?

336
00:13:03,435 --> 00:13:05,395
-Why'd they leave the trailer?

337
00:13:05,895 --> 00:13:07,022
-They'll be back soon enough.

338
00:13:07,022 --> 00:13:09,733
-Well, how'd that fat kid fit
in that old convertible?

339
00:13:07,022 --> 00:13:09,733
-Well, how'd that fat kid fit
in that old convertible?

340
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:11,609
-And don't think I'm givin'
you any free meals

341
00:13:11,609 --> 00:13:13,695
like your mom does.

342
00:13:11,609 --> 00:13:13,695
like your mom does.

343
00:13:13,695 --> 00:13:14,904
Is that why you're here?

344
00:13:14,904 --> 00:13:16,573
-Guess not.

345
00:13:21,202 --> 00:13:22,620
(under his breath)
Waited this long.

346
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,623
-Morning, Ferris, boys.

347
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,623
-Morning, Ferris, boys.

348
00:13:25,623 --> 00:13:27,751
-Levi, Miss Earline.

349
00:13:27,751 --> 00:13:30,462
-Ferris, about that business
across the street-

350
00:13:27,751 --> 00:13:30,462
-Ferris, about that business
across the street-

351
00:13:30,462 --> 00:13:32,547
I thought they'd have
pulled out by now.

352
00:13:32,547 --> 00:13:34,382
-It's bad enough, what
happened yesterday,

353
00:13:32,547 --> 00:13:34,382
-It's bad enough, what

-It is my lot, ma'am.

357
00:13:37,552 --> 00:13:39,345
-It is my lot, ma'am.

358
00:13:39,345 --> 00:13:41,681
-Well, they've been gone since
early this mornin'.

359
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:44,350
You got any idea
where they went?

360
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:44,350
You got any idea
where they went?

361
00:13:46,936 --> 00:13:49,689
-He gave me money
to feed the boy.

362
00:13:46,936 --> 00:13:49,689
-He gave me money
to feed the boy.

363
00:13:50,565 --> 00:13:53,276
-You mean, that boy
is still out there?

364
00:13:53,276 --> 00:13:55,361
-He said he'd just
be overnight.

365
00:13:53,276 --> 00:13:55,361
-He said he'd just
be overnight.

366
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:56,988
-Sheriff, it's illegal
to abandon a child

367
00:13:56,988 --> 00:13:59,741
in the state of Texas.

368

And immoral, anywhere

-Okay, what would you
like me to do?

371
00:14:02,952 --> 00:14:05,371
-Okay, what would you
like me to do?

372
00:14:05,371 --> 00:14:07,290
-Well, there's an
abandoned child.

373
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,960
So call the Social Services
on him, or I will.

374
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,960
So call the Social Services
on him, or I will.

375
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:15,840
-So, why--

376
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,634
He must be on the
toilet or somethin'.

377
00:14:17,634 --> 00:14:19,969
-Stop bein' a baby.

378
00:14:17,634 --> 00:14:19,969
-Stop bein' a baby.

379
00:14:23,932 --> 00:14:25,683
-Unbelievable.

380
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,394
Man, you gotta see this.
Look at this.

381
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,394
Man, you gotta see this.
Look at this.

00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:36,694
Look-- Have you ever seen a
cereal box that big?

383

Look-- Have you ever seen a
cereal box that big?

384
00:14:39,572 --> 00:14:41,658

00:14:41,658 --> 00:14:44,786
You get out of here!
I'm callin' the cops!

386

387
00:14:49,124 --> 00:14:51,960
-This guy's a lot bigger

388
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,419
-Give him time.

389
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,419
-Give him time.

390
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:54,879
-No way. The man said
he only weighed

391
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:57,048
four hundred and
forty-three pounds, right?

392
00:14:57,048 --> 00:14:58,550
-Well, I doubt if
that's even true.

393
00:14:57,048 --> 00:14:58,550
-Well, I doubt if
that's even true.

394
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,385
Man, I want a refund.

Well, here, you boys are.

525
00:19:11,076 --> 00:19:12,953
(Speaks Spanish)

526
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:16,081
He minds better in Spanish.

527
00:19:17,165 --> 00:19:19,668
What are you boys up to? Hmm?

528
00:19:17,165 --> 00:19:19,668
What are you boys up to? Hmm?

529
00:19:21,962 --> 00:19:24,423
Listen, I've got a
favor to ask y'all.

530
00:19:21,962 --> 00:19:24,423
Listen, I've got a
favor to ask y'all.

531
00:19:24,423 --> 00:19:26,091
Would you mind comin' with me

532
00:19:26,091 --> 00:19:28,176
over to that
side-show trailer?

533
00:19:28,176 --> 00:19:29,302
-Sure.

534
00:19:28,176 --> 00:19:29,302
-Sure.

535
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:32,639
-I need to find out what those
fellow's plans are.

536
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:36,101
But I don't wanna scare
that-- that fat kid, you know?

537
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:36,101
But I don't wanna scare
that-- that fat kid, you know?

538
00:19:36,101 --> 00:19:40,188
And since you boys are about
his age, maybe he'll relax,

539
00:19:36,101 --> 00:19:40,188
And since you boys are about
his age, maybe he'll relax,

540
00:19:40,188 --> 00:19:43,567
loosen up and tell me the
whereabouts of that other guy.

541
00:19:50,073 --> 00:19:52,200
-It's a nice place
you got here.

542
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,452
(sighs)

543
00:19:53,452 --> 00:19:54,703
-You have everything you need?

544
00:19:53,452 --> 00:19:54,703
-You have everything you need?

545
00:19:54,703 --> 00:19:56,745
-I'm fine, cowboy.

546
00:19:56,745 --> 00:19:59,458
-Sheriff'll do.

547
00:19:56,745 --> 00:19:59,458
-Sheriff'll do.

548
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,084
Looks like you
got a problem with your

549
00:20:01,084 --> 00:20:04,087
window over there.
What happened?

550
00:20:01,084 --> 00:20:04,087
window over there.
What happened?

551
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:07,799
-I guess some kids did it.

552
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,384
-Well, I'll drop by
later on and we'll

553
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,384
-Well, I'll drop by
later on and we'll

554
00:20:09,384 --> 00:20:11,303
get somebody
to fix it.

555
00:20:11,845 --> 00:20:13,805
Toby and Cal, here,
are about your age.

556
00:20:11,845 --> 00:20:13,805
Toby and Cal, here,
are about your age.

557
00:20:13,805 --> 00:20:15,182
How old are you boys?

558
00:20:15,182 --> 00:20:16,475
-Twelve.
-Twelve.

559
00:20:16,475 --> 00:20:17,809
-I'm fourteen.

560
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:20,187
-You don't sound like
you're from Texas.

561
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:20,187
-You don't sound like
you're from Texas.

562
00:20:20,187 --> 00:20:23,440
-I'm from New York-- New
York City. Ever heard of it?

563
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,235
(chuckling) You're somewhat
of a comedian, too.

564
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,235
(chuckling) You're somewhat
of a comedian, too.

565
00:20:27,235 --> 00:20:29,237
Here?

566
00:20:27,235 --> 00:20:29,237
Here?

567
00:20:29,237 --> 00:20:32,657
Ah... so you and Wizard are
from New York, is that right?

568
00:20:32,657 --> 00:20:37,579
-"Wizard"? Nobody calls
Paulie that, except Paulie.

569
00:20:32,657 --> 00:20:37,579
-"Wizard"? Nobody calls
Paulie that, except Paulie.

570
00:20:37,579 --> 00:20:39,831
He's from Jersey.

571
00:20:37,579 --> 00:20:39,831
He's from Jersey.

572
00:20:39,831 --> 00:20:42,167
-Do you know where
Paulie is now?

573
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:44,836
-He's lookin' for a couple of
acts to add to our show.

574
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:44,836
-He's lookin' for a couple of
acts to add to our show.

575
00:20:44,836 --> 00:20:47,130
-So, Paulie is your father?

576
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,549
-No way.

577
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,549
-No way.

578
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:51,843
Hey, put it down.
My mom gave that to me.

579
00:20:51,843 --> 00:20:54,387
-Put it down.
-It's just a bible.

580
00:20:51,843 --> 00:20:54,387
-Put it down.
-It's just a bible.

581
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:56,223
-It's not "just a bible."

582
00:20:56,223 --> 00:20:58,558
My mom gave that to me
when I got baptized.

583
00:20:58,558 --> 00:20:59,768
-Cal--

584
00:20:58,558 --> 00:20:59,768
-Cal--

585
00:20:59,768 --> 00:21:01,269
-Now, put it back.

586
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:03,522
-Cal, now put the boy's bible
down.

587
00:21:04,814 --> 00:21:07,442
All right, so where
are your parents?

588
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:10,153
-Rosemont Cemetery.

589
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:10,153
-Rosemont Cemetery.

590
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:12,739
-Oh, well, I'm sorry
to hear that, son.

591
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:16,576
-I'm not your son.

592
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:16,576
-I'm not your son.

593
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:18,828
-Of course not... Who is your
legal guardian?

594
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:18,828
-Of course not... Who is your
legal guardian?

595
00:21:18,828 --> 00:21:21,498
-Paulie Rankin's
my legal guardian.

596
00:21:21,498 --> 00:21:23,542
-I see. Well, I hate to
break this to you, but,

597
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:27,462
Mr. Rankin should never
have left you here.

598
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:27,462
Mr. Rankin should never
have left you here.

599
00:21:27,462 --> 00:21:29,381
-There's nothin'
to worry about.

600
00:21:27,462 --> 00:21:29,381
-There's nothin'
to worry about.

601
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:31,341
Paulie'll be back by tomorrow.

602
00:21:31,341 --> 00:21:34,469
-Well, he told Ferris he would
be back today.

603
00:21:31,341 --> 00:21:34,469
-Well, he told Ferris he would
be back today.

604
00:21:34,469 --> 00:21:38,390
-Really? I'm his business
partner, you know.

605
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,433
-I see.

606
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,433
-I see.

607
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:43,728
Well... you boys stay here and
get acquainted.

608
00:21:43,728 --> 00:21:49,776
Mr. Beaver, I do hope
your partner comes back.

609
00:21:43,728 --> 00:21:49,776
Mr. Beaver, I do hope
your partner comes back.

610
00:21:43,728 --> 00:21:49,776
Mr. Beaver, I do hope
your partner comes back.

611
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:54,656
-What is this?

612
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:54,656
-What is this?

613
00:21:54,656 --> 00:21:57,993
I'm the biggest crime problem
in the whole town?

614
00:21:57,993 --> 00:21:59,953
-Ah- choo!

615
00:21:57,993 --> 00:21:59,953
-Ah- choo!

616
00:22:02,581 --> 00:22:05,083
Sure gets
dusty in here quick,

617
00:22:02,581 --> 00:22:05,083
Sure gets
dusty in here quick,

618
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,877
with that window broken.

619
00:22:09,379 --> 00:22:11,214
-Get the TV, too.

620
00:22:13,425 --> 00:22:15,093
-You do tricks with
those or somethin'?

621
00:22:13,425 --> 00:22:15,093
-You do tricks with
those or somethin'?

622
00:22:15,093 --> 00:22:16,886
-Yeah, they're called
sleights.

623
00:22:16,886 --> 00:22:19,472
It's all about the shuffle and
the patter.

624
00:22:16,886 --> 00:22:19,472
It's all about the shuffle and
the patter.

625
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:21,725
Shuffle and the patter.

626
00:22:21,725 --> 00:22:23,101
(chuckling)
Oh, hey, here, look.

627
00:22:23,101 --> 00:22:24,644
There's the Wizard.

628
00:22:23,101 --> 00:22:24,644
There's the Wizard.

629
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:25,895
-That's an old book.

630
00:22:25,895 --> 00:22:29,023
Paulie and I are gonna be much
bigger than all of those acts.

631
00:22:25,895 --> 00:22:29,023
Paulie and I are gonna be much
bigger than all of those acts.

632
00:22:29,023 --> 00:22:33,695
We're adding more talent. We
got a big future in show biz.

633
00:22:33,695 --> 00:22:35,572
-Right.

634
00:22:33,695 --> 00:22:35,572
-Right.

635
00:22:35,947 --> 00:22:38,700
-So what do you cowpokes do
around her for fun?

636
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,160
-We're not cowpokes.

637
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,160
-We're not cowpokes.

638
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,495
-Really? Isn't this Texas?

639
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:44,080
Where the buffalo
roam and the deer

640
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:44,080
Where the buffalo
roam and the deer

641
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,416
and the cantaloupe play?

642
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:48,084
-Right, there's tons of
cantaloupe

643
00:22:48,084 --> 00:22:49,586
running around out here.

644
00:22:48,084 --> 00:22:49,586
running around out here.

645
00:22:49,586 --> 00:22:51,713
They're right outside
of WalMarts.

646
00:22:51,713 --> 00:22:52,839
-I said antelope.

647
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:53,923
-No, you didn't.
-Yeah, I did.

648
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:53,923
-No, you didn't.
-Yeah, I did.

649
00:22:53,923 --> 00:22:55,467
-Didn't.
-Did.

650
00:22:55,467 --> 00:22:57,510
(CONTINUES OVERLAPPING)

651
00:22:58,762 --> 00:23:00,680
-Hey, guys?

652
00:22:58,762 --> 00:23:00,680
-Hey, guys?

653
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,723
-You said cantaloupe.

654
00:23:01,723 --> 00:23:02,766
Don't mess with me, okay?

655
00:23:02,766 --> 00:23:03,808
-We're not cowpokes.

656
00:23:02,766 --> 00:23:03,808
-We're not cowpokes.

657
00:23:03,808 --> 00:23:04,809
-Cantaloupe! Cantaloupe!
Cant--

658
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:06,436
(CONTINUES OVERLAPPING)

659
00:23:06,436 --> 00:23:07,812
-Guys, come on.

660
00:23:07,812 --> 00:23:08,855
-Did, did, di--

661
00:23:07,812 --> 00:23:08,855
-Did, did, di--

662
00:23:08,855 --> 00:23:10,440
(yelling)
Cal!

663
00:23:11,566 --> 00:23:12,734
-It's time to go.

664
00:23:14,444 --> 00:23:15,737
-I know you said cantaloupe.

665
00:23:19,074 --> 00:23:21,451
-Hey, it's pretty cool he
didn't tell on us, huh?

666
00:23:21,743 --> 00:23:22,744
-Yeah.

667
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:30,126
-Otto.

668
00:23:34,089 --> 00:23:36,716
-I heard you boys were in the
back of the squad car.

669
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:38,093
Were you in some kind of
trouble?

670
00:23:38,093 --> 00:23:39,094
-Not at all.

671
00:23:38,093 --> 00:23:39,094
-Not at all.

672
00:23:39,094 --> 00:23:40,303
-We were helpin'
the sheriff with

673
00:23:40,303 --> 00:23:43,890
some official business, about
Zachary Beaver over there.

674
00:23:40,303 --> 00:23:43,890
some official business, about
Zachary Beaver over there.

675
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,183
-Now, Otto, I wouldn't
want my son

676
00:23:45,183 --> 00:23:46,559
mixed up with those people.

677
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,019
-These boys have
been a big help.

678
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:49,854
Find out anything new
I need to know?

679
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:49,854
Find out anything new
I need to know?

680
00:23:49,854 --> 00:23:50,855
-And if your wife was here,

681
00:23:50,855 --> 00:23:52,691
she'd probably just write a
song about it,

682
00:23:52,691 --> 00:23:54,943
somethin' like, "The Battle
of Zachary Beaver."

683
00:23:52,691 --> 00:23:54,943
somethin' like, "The Battle
of Zachary Beaver."

684
00:23:54,943 --> 00:23:56,861
-Any word on that contest yet?

685
00:23:57,862 --> 00:24:00,615
-No... not yet.

686
00:23:57,862 --> 00:24:00,615
-No... not yet.

687
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:03,159
Toby, I need you to
come with me.

688
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:05,161
Sorry, Cal.

689
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:05,161
Sorry, Cal.

690
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:11,084
(exhales)

691
00:24:17,674 --> 00:24:19,175
-She didn't win.

692
00:24:17,674 --> 00:24:19,175
-She didn't win.

693
00:24:19,175 --> 00:24:22,053
-But you just told everybody.

694
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:28,935
Um... was a long shot.

695
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:28,935
Um... was a long shot.

696
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:31,604
Guess we'll have her back
tomorrow, right, dad?

697
00:24:32,647 --> 00:24:35,191
-She'll be stayin' on

Look, it doesn't matter
if she didn't win.

876
00:32:40,237 --> 00:32:41,739
I'm proud of
her for just tryin'

877
00:32:40,237 --> 00:32:41,739
I'm proud of
her for just tryin'

878
00:32:41,739 --> 00:32:43,032
to get out of this town.

879
00:32:43,032 --> 00:32:45,826
-Toby, I wanna see him.

880
00:32:48,078 --> 00:32:49,830
(KNOCK AT THE TOOR)

881
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,165
-Come in.

882
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,165
-Come in.

883
00:32:53,334 --> 00:32:55,002
-What are you doin' here?

884
00:32:55,002 --> 00:32:56,837
-Where have you been?

885
00:32:55,002 --> 00:32:56,837
-Where have you been?

886
00:32:57,171 --> 00:32:58,214
Oh.

887
00:32:58,214 --> 00:32:59,965
Hey, squirt.

888
00:33:05,804 --> 00:33:08,766
-He's blowin' up! Eew!

889
00:33:05,804 --> 00:33:08,766
-He's blowin' up! Eew!

890
00:33:09,433 --> 00:33:10,851
-Bahh!

891
00:33:10,851 --> 00:33:12,645
(laughing) Oh, man.

892
00:33:10,851 --> 00:33:12,645
(laughing) Oh, man.

893
00:33:13,187 --> 00:33:15,105
(laughing)

894
00:33:16,148 --> 00:33:17,441
-Where are your glasses?

895
00:33:17,441 --> 00:33:19,026
-Contacts.

896
00:33:19,026 --> 00:33:20,402
-You look weird.

897
00:33:20,402 --> 00:33:21,946
-What's that smell-- perfume?

898
00:33:20,402 --> 00:33:21,946
-What's that smell-- perfume?

899
00:33:21,946 --> 00:33:22,947
-No.

900
00:33:22,947 --> 00:33:25,032
-Hey, I heard about the fire.
That's wild.

901
00:33:25,032 --> 00:33:26,200
-What fire?

902
00:33:25,032 --> 00:33:26,200
-What fire?

903
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,036
-At Country Music
Television Studio.

904
00:33:29,036 --> 00:33:31,330
Just a small one, but it
messed up some stuff

905
00:33:29,036 --> 00:33:31,330
Just a small one, but it
messed up some stuff

906
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:32,748
my mom was doing there.

907
00:33:32,748 --> 00:33:35,876
-Hey, when did your
mom die, anyway?

908
00:33:35,876 --> 00:33:37,127
You said she got
you that bible

909
00:33:35,876 --> 00:33:37,127
You said she got
you that bible

910
00:33:37,127 --> 00:33:38,420
when you were baptized, right?

911
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,756
-I didn't never say
I got baptized.

912
00:33:40,756 --> 00:33:42,883
I said I almost got baptized.

913
00:33:40,756 --> 00:33:42,883
I said I almost got baptized.

914
00:33:42,883 --> 00:33:44,760
-How does someone
almost get baptized?

915
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,804
-Have you ever been baptized?

916
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,804
-Have you ever been baptized?

917
00:33:47,054 --> 00:33:48,389
-No.

918
00:33:48,389 --> 00:33:50,890
-Toby, take me home!

919
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:51,892
-Gotta go.

920
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:51,892
-Gotta go.

921
00:33:51,892 --> 00:33:52,855
-See ya.

922
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:53,280
-See ya.

923
00:33:58,827 --> 00:34:01,204
<i>-Toby, the contest
was last night and</i>

924
00:34:01,204 --> 00:34:03,456
<i>I've finally calmed down.</i>

925
00:34:01,204 --> 00:34:03,456
<i>I've finally calmed down.</i>

926
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,042
Now, what I'm about to
write to you is pretty

927
00:34:06,042 --> 00:34:09,004
darn hard for me, and it
has nothing to do

928
00:34:06,042 --> 00:34:09,004
darn hard for me, and it
has nothing to do

929
00:34:09,004 --> 00:34:11,047
with whether I won or not.

930
00:34:11,047 --> 00:34:14,175
I didn't, but never mind that.
(sighs)

931
00:34:11,047 --> 00:34:14,175
I didn't, but never mind that.
(sighs)

932
00:34:14,175 --> 00:34:17,846
Me and your dad have been havin'
a rough time of it lately,

933
00:34:17,846 --> 00:34:21,850
and I need some time to
figure some things out.

934
00:34:17,846 --> 00:34:21,850
and I need some time to
figure some things out.

935
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:23,226
Don't go blamin'
yourself.

936
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:23,226
Don't go blamin'
yourself.

937
00:34:23,226 --> 00:34:25,311
You are the best son
that a mother could have.

938
00:34:25,311 --> 00:34:26,478
And I'm not leaving you.

939
00:34:26,478 --> 00:34:27,897
Your father has
my phone number

940
00:34:26,478 --> 00:34:27,897
Your father has
my phone number

941
00:34:27,897 --> 00:34:30,190
and I'm only a
phone call away.

942
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,027
Come to think of it, that
would make a really

943
00:34:32,027 --> 00:34:34,154
good title for a song.

944
00:34:32,027 --> 00:34:34,154
good title for a song.

-Son. Listen, I don't
think we'll bother

952
00:35:04,225 --> 00:35:07,103
with the worm run today.

953
00:35:07,645 --> 00:35:09,898
-The bait shops are waiting.

954
00:35:07,645 --> 00:35:09,898

955
00:35:10,315 --> 00:35:13,026
-Let's give the fish a break.

00:35:10,315 --> 00:35:13,026
-Let's give the fish a break.

957
00:35:13,026 --> 00:35:16,404
-Dad? Dad.

(yells) Damn it, Dad!

960
00:35:18,448 --> 00:35:21,159
-Hey, you don't use that
kind of language.

961
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:22,410
-How else can I get
your attention?

962
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,036
-You try that stunt again,
you're gonna get

963
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,036
-You try that stunt again,
you're gonna get

964
00:35:24,036 --> 00:35:25,372
the wrong kind of attention.

965
00:35:25,372 --> 00:35:28,458
Now, put the worms back,
like I told you.

966
00:35:25,372 --> 00:35:28,458
Now, put the worms back,
like I told you.

967
00:35:29,209 --> 00:35:32,545
(sighs) This is what I think of
your freakin' worms.

968
00:35:36,716 --> 00:35:38,676
-You shouldn't have done that.

969
00:35:36,716 --> 00:35:38,676
-You shouldn't have done that.

970
00:35:39,677 --> 00:35:42,430
-What does it matter.
Mom's left.

971
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:44,766
You care more about the worms.

972
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:44,766
You care more about the worms.

973
00:35:44,766 --> 00:35:47,310
Nobody cares about me.

974
00:35:48,268 --> 00:35:52,690
-I do. I've provided a
very good life for you

975
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:56,653
and your mother-- a very
good, quality life.

976
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:56,653
and your mother-- a very
good, quality life.

977
00:35:56,653 --> 00:36:00,115
I guess it wasn't excitin'
enough for your Mom.

978
00:35:56,653 --> 00:36:00,115
I guess it wasn't excitin'
enough for your Mom.

979
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:02,784
Maybe that's why she
ain't comin' back.

980
00:36:02,784 --> 00:36:06,454
-You don't know that.
She may come back.

981
00:36:02,784 --> 00:36:06,454
-You don't know that.
She may come back.

982
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,628
What if she doesn't?

983
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,628
What if she doesn't?

984
00:36:13,628 --> 00:36:16,256
What's gonna happen to us?

985
00:36:16,631 --> 00:36:18,550
-We're gonna be fine.

986
00:36:16,631 --> 00:36:18,550
-We're gonna be fine.

987
00:36:19,592 --> 00:36:23,555
We're gonna live here
and we'll be fine.

988
00:36:19,592 --> 00:36:23,555
We're gonna live here
and we'll be fine.

989
00:36:23,555 --> 00:36:24,681
After you grow up,

990
00:36:24,681 --> 00:36:26,724
you can decide where and what
your life's gonna be,

991
00:36:26,724 --> 00:36:30,061
but until then, this is it.

992
00:36:26,724 --> 00:36:30,061
but until then, this is it.

993
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,272
-Then, I can't wait
to grow up.

994
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,272
-Then, I can't wait
to grow up.

995
00:36:40,155 --> 00:36:42,699
-Social Services is comin'
for him tomorrow.

996
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:44,451
So we gotta do it.

997
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:44,451
So we gotta do it.

998
00:36:44,451 --> 00:36:47,871
-What does Social Services do
with abandoned children?

-What does Social Services do
with abandoned children?

1000
00:36:47,871 --> 00:36:50,665
-Foster homes or some
juvenile center place.

-I bet he won't go for it.

1004
00:36:56,379 --> 00:36:57,714
-I bet he will.

1005
00:36:57,714 --> 00:37:02,343
-This is she. Oh,
man, this is great--

1006

-This is she. Oh,
man, this is great--

1007
00:37:02,343 --> 00:37:04,179
-How would he fit in the car.

1008
00:37:02,343 --> 00:37:04,179
-How would he fit in the car.

1009
00:37:04,179 --> 00:37:07,515
-We take the pickup.
He rides in the back.

1010
00:37:08,683 --> 00:37:09,893
They're on their way.

1011
00:37:09,893 --> 00:37:11,978
Ladybugs arrive on this
afternoon's train.

1012
00:37:11,978 --> 00:37:13,438
-Then we'll set the
dance for tomorrow.

1013
00:37:11,978 --> 00:37:13,438
-Then we'll set the
dance for tomorrow.

1014
00:37:13,438 --> 00:37:14,731
-Okay.

1015
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:16,858
-Yeah, let's do it for him.

1016
00:37:16,858 --> 00:37:18,610
-Who would drive us?

1017
00:37:16,858 --> 00:37:18,610
-Who would drive us?

1018
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:20,862
-Absolutely not. If you think
I'm gonna have

1019
00:37:20,862 --> 00:37:22,739
any part of making fun
of somebody,

1020
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:23,990
then you're wrong.

1021
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:23,990
then you're wrong.

1022
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:26,326
-I'm not making fun of him.

1023
00:37:26,326 --> 00:37:27,534
-Right.

1024
00:37:27,534 --> 00:37:29,329
(grunts)
We're not, honest.

1025
00:37:27,534 --> 00:37:29,329
(grunts)
We're not, honest.

1026
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:33,166
Just think he might want
to see a drive-in movie.

1027
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:33,166
Just think he might want
to see a drive-in movie.

1028
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:34,959
Just forget it, Toby, okay?

1029
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:36,878
Some people are too
important to help out

1030
00:37:36,878 --> 00:37:41,257
a lonely guy on his way to
foster home misery.

1031
00:37:36,878 --> 00:37:41,257
a lonely guy on his way to
foster home misery.

1032

(sighs) I wanna
meet him first.

(sighs) I wanna
meet him first.

1034

(sighs) I'm not goin'
anywhere.

1035
00:37:47,722 --> 00:37:50,558
-We have a truck. We could all
ride in the back.

1036

-We have a truck. We could all
ride in the back.

1037
00:37:51,392 --> 00:37:53,269
-Forget it.

1038

-Forget it.

-I understand your mom
died two years ago.

-I understand why you left.

1399
00:56:09,206 --> 00:56:12,293
Hey, listen.
The howling stopped.

1400
00:56:09,206 --> 00:56:12,293
Hey, listen.
The howling stopped.

1401
00:56:15,322 --> 00:56:18,199
-Thomas Edison was so smart.

1402
00:56:18,199 --> 00:56:20,994
He even invented stuff
out of order.

1403
00:56:18,199 --> 00:56:20,994
He even invented stuff
out of order.

1404
00:56:20,994 --> 00:56:23,788
He invented the record
player in 1877,

1405
00:56:20,994 --> 00:56:23,788
He invented the record
player in 1877,

1406
00:56:23,788 --> 00:56:27,626
but the microphone wasn't
invented until 1878.

1407
00:56:27,626 --> 00:56:29,210
Think about it.

1408
00:56:27,626 --> 00:56:29,210
Think about it.

1409
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:30,920
What recordings could
Edison's player play

1410
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:34,090
that first year. Weird, huh?

1411
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:34,090
that first year. Weird, huh?

1412
00:56:34,633 --> 00:56:37,135
-You sure know a lot of stuff.

1413
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:44,851
Have you ever been
to a funeral?

1414
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:44,851
Have you ever been
to a funeral?

1415
00:56:45,226 --> 00:56:49,189
-Yeah, my mother's.
It was awful.

1416
00:56:45,226 --> 00:56:49,189
-Yeah, my mother's.
It was awful.

1417
00:56:49,856 --> 00:56:53,276
They had to make
a special casket.

1418
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:56,613
She was like me,
you know. Bigger.

1419
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:56,613
She was like me,
you know. Bigger.

1420
00:56:57,906 --> 00:57:03,036
(sighs) Anyway, CNN showed up,
Dateline--

1421
00:56:57,906 --> 00:57:03,036
(sighs) Anyway, CNN showed up,
Dateline--

1422
00:57:04,037 --> 00:57:07,082
lookin' for human-
interest news.

1423
00:57:07,082 --> 00:57:10,877
When they saw me,
it got out of hand.

1424
00:57:07,082 --> 00:57:10,877
When they saw me,
it got out of hand.

1425
00:57:10,877 --> 00:57:12,754
It was supposed to be private.

1426
00:57:14,047 --> 00:57:16,299
-What happened to your dad?

1427
00:57:16,925 --> 00:57:19,469
-Gone since I was a baby.

1428
00:57:16,925 --> 00:57:19,469
-Gone since I was a baby.

1429
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:22,013
So Paulie's my legal guardian,

1430
00:57:22,013 --> 00:57:24,724
the closest thing I've
got to family.

1431
00:57:22,013 --> 00:57:24,724
the closest thing I've
got to family.

1432
00:57:28,937 --> 00:57:31,773
-My mom's staying
in Nashville.

1433
00:57:31,773 --> 00:57:35,193
She left us for a shot at a
singing career.

1434
00:57:31,773 --> 00:57:35,193
She left us for a shot at a
singing career.

1435
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:38,405
I don't know when I'll
ever see her again.

1436
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:38,405
I don't know when I'll
ever see her again.

1437
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:41,825
(sighing) I thought I
was going to die

1438
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:46,996
Before-- The train. And I
thought then, that

1439
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:46,996
Before-- The train. And I
thought then, that

1440
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:50,166
I'd never see my mother again.

1441
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:50,166
I'd never see my mother again.

1442
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:53,336
-But your mother's
already dead.

1443
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:56,214
-That's why she wanted
me to get baptized--

1444
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:56,214
-That's why she wanted
me to get baptized--

1445
00:57:56,214 --> 00:57:58,425
so I could see her
again in heaven.

1446
00:57:56,214 --> 00:57:58,425
so I could see her
again in heaven.

1447
00:57:58,425 --> 00:58:01,428
-So, since your
weren't baptized,

1448
00:58:01,428 --> 00:58:04,097
you can't go to heaven?

1449
00:58:01,428 --> 00:58:04,097
you can't go to heaven?

1450
00:58:04,931 --> 00:58:07,809
-Apparently they
don't let you in.

1451
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:20,989
You know, you
got yourself

1452
00:58:20,989 --> 00:58:22,574
a pretty mellow daddy,
there, my man.

1453
00:58:22,574 --> 00:58:24,909
I- I'd count my
blessings on that.

1454
00:58:22,574 --> 00:58:24,909
I- I'd count my
blessings on that.

1455
00:58:24,909 --> 00:58:27,912
I'd be major p. o.' d if my
boy took my truck

1456
00:58:27,912 --> 00:58:30,123
and carried around a, uh--

1457
00:58:27,912 --> 00:58:30,123
and carried around a, uh--

1458
00:58:30,123 --> 00:58:32,082
I mean, how much
does he weigh?

1459
00:58:36,921 --> 00:58:39,883
...He makes my lie down
in green pastures.

1460
00:58:36,921 --> 00:58:39,883
...He makes my lie down
in green pastures.

1461
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:42,177
He Leads me on the path of
righteousness for

1462
00:58:42,177 --> 00:58:43,428
His name' sake

1463
00:58:42,177 --> 00:58:43,428
His name' sake

1464
00:58:43,428 --> 00:58:45,889
Even though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

1465
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:49,433
I fear no evil, for
thou art with me

1466
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:49,433
I fear no evil, for
thou art with me

1467
00:58:49,433 --> 00:58:53,480
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me... "

1468
00:58:49,433 --> 00:58:53,480
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me... "

1469
00:58:55,522 --> 00:58:57,192
TOW TRUCK DRIVER:
Good luck to you!

1470
00:59:04,491 --> 00:59:06,701
-You boys are in
a lot a trouble.

1471
00:59:06,701 --> 00:59:09,078
A lot of trouble.

1472
00:59:06,701 --> 00:59:09,078
A lot of trouble.

1473
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:12,415
Otto woke up everybody,
lookin' for auto thieves,

1474
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:13,500
kidnappers,
you name it.

1475
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:13,500
kidnappers,
you name it.

1476
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,043
(car horn honks)

1477
00:59:15,043 --> 00:59:17,504
And it was not a good
day for it either.

1478
00:59:19,464 --> 00:59:22,258
Don't ever start drinkin,
boys.

1479
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:24,052
Next to Money--

1480
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:24,052
Next to Money--

1481
00:59:24,052 --> 00:59:25,678
-It's the root of all evil.

1482
00:59:25,678 --> 00:59:28,348
-Who told you that?

1483
00:59:29,015 --> 00:59:31,976
-I think I've heard it
once or twice.

1484
00:59:32,477 --> 00:59:34,145
-Well, don't even think
about goin' anywhere.

1485
00:59:32,477 --> 00:59:34,145
-Well, don't even think
about goin' anywhere.

1486
00:59:34,145 --> 00:59:36,189
You're dad's on the way.

1487
00:59:36,564 --> 00:59:39,609
And the Sheriff's comin' to see
you, Mr. Beaver...

1488
00:59:36,564 --> 00:59:39,609
And the Sheriff's comin' to see
you, Mr. Beaver...

1489
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:42,111
and let you know they'll
be takin' you away

1490
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:44,614
later today.

1491
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:44,614
later today.

1492
00:59:46,032 --> 00:59:48,117
-My dad's gonna kill me.

1493
00:59:52,038 --> 00:59:54,582
-Here.

1494
00:59:52,038 --> 00:59:54,582
-Here.

1495
00:59:54,582 --> 00:59:56,626
Sixty- seven dollars.

1496
00:59:56,626 --> 01:00:01,089
All the money I owe for
my tab. We're even.

1497
00:59:56,626 --> 01:00:01,089
All the money I owe for
my tab. We're even.

1498
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:08,638
And you lie, just as much as
your new best friend.

1499
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:08,638
And you lie, just as much as
your new best friend.

1500
01:00:10,515 --> 01:00:13,560
Everyone knows about your mom.

1501
01:00:10,515 --> 01:00:13,560
Everyone knows about your mom.

1502
01:00:15,144 --> 01:00:18,648
She's never... coming... back.

1503
01:00:15,144 --> 01:00:18,648
She's never... coming... back.

1504
01:00:19,816 --> 01:00:22,569
Never, ever...

1505
01:00:24,779 --> 01:00:28,074
(gasps)
...coming back.

1506
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:33,538
Like Wayne.

1507
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:33,538
Like Wayne.

1508
01:00:56,728 --> 01:00:58,479
-Why don't you tell your
little friend that you

1509
01:00:56,728 --> 01:00:58,479
-Why don't you tell your
little friend that you

1510
01:00:58,479 --> 01:01:00,231
can't visit right now.

1511
01:01:01,399 --> 01:01:03,275
Come and see me inside.

1512
01:01:09,616 --> 01:01:12,243
-Thanks for the necklace,

1513
01:01:12,243 --> 01:01:14,579
but I can't keep it.

1514
01:01:12,243 --> 01:01:14,579
but I can't keep it.

1515
01:01:14,954 --> 01:01:16,664
-Why not?

1516
01:01:16,664 --> 01:01:18,541
-It's too much gift.

1517
01:01:16,664 --> 01:01:18,541
-It's too much gift.

1518
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:21,586
My mom said I have
to return it to ya.

1519
01:01:21,586 --> 01:01:24,631
And... pearls remind
me of somethin'

1520
01:01:21,586 --> 01:01:24,631
And... pearls remind
me of somethin'

1521
01:01:24,631 --> 01:01:29,260
an old lady would
wear. I'm sorry.

1522
01:01:24,631 --> 01:01:29,260
an old lady would
wear. I'm sorry.

1523
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:33,514
-My mom never
wore 'em either.

1524
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:33,514
-My mom never
wore 'em either.

1525
01:01:34,641 --> 01:01:36,643
-Did you really steal
your dad's truck and

1526
01:01:36,643 --> 01:01:39,187
drive halfway to Bishop?

1527
01:01:36,643 --> 01:01:39,187
drive halfway to Bishop?

1528
01:01:40,605 --> 01:01:42,523
Wow.

1529
01:01:44,525 --> 01:01:46,444
Bye.

1530
01:01:57,997 --> 01:01:59,457
-Is that a present?

1531
01:01:57,997 --> 01:01:59,457
-Is that a present?

1532
01:01:59,457 --> 01:02:00,500
-No.

1533
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,584
-Then what is it?

1534
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:02,669
-It's nothing.

1535
01:02:02,669 --> 01:02:05,546
-Hey. Come back here.

1536
01:02:02,669 --> 01:02:05,546
-Hey. Come back here.

1537
01:02:06,506 --> 01:02:08,758
-I'm not mad at you.
-Good.

1538
01:02:06,506 --> 01:02:08,758
-I'm not mad at you.
-Good.

1539
01:02:10,343 --> 01:02:12,887
Son, do you
have any idea

1540
01:02:12,887 --> 01:02:14,764
what you put me through,
waitin' to hear

1541
01:02:12,887 --> 01:02:14,764
what you put me through,
waitin' to hear

1542
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:16,849
from you last night? Do you?

1543
01:02:16,849 --> 01:02:19,310
-If your not mad
at me, why are you yelling?

1544
01:02:16,849 --> 01:02:19,310
-If your not mad
at me, why are you yelling?

1545
01:02:19,811 --> 01:02:22,438
(sighs) I don't know.

1546
01:02:22,814 --> 01:02:25,566
-Whatever. Just leave
me alone, okay?

1547
01:02:22,814 --> 01:02:25,566
-Whatever. Just leave
me alone, okay?

1548
01:02:36,077 --> 01:02:37,787
-I see you up there.

1549
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:42,000
Come on, Toby.

1550
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,424
-You're gonna fall.

1551
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,424
-You're gonna fall.

1552
01:02:49,424 --> 01:02:51,676
-I used to be a pretty good
climber, too.

1553
01:02:52,844 --> 01:02:58,349
I spent all last night dreading
I'd never see you again.

1554
01:02:52,844 --> 01:02:58,349
I spent all last night dreading
I'd never see you again.

1555
01:02:58,725 --> 01:03:01,853
I'm not mad.
I'm relieved.

1556
01:03:04,731 --> 01:03:09,527
Wayne's folks--
they aren't so lucky.

1557
01:03:04,731 --> 01:03:09,527
Wayne's folks--
they aren't so lucky.

1558
01:03:09,527 --> 01:03:11,904
They don' t get
him back, do they?

1559
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:14,782
-I know. Life sucks.

1560
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:14,782
-I know. Life sucks.

1561
01:03:14,782 --> 01:03:18,119
I can't count on
anyone or anything.

1562
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:26,127
-You can. You can count on me.

1563
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:26,127
-You can. You can count on me.

1564
01:03:28,755 --> 01:03:31,257
And you can count
on your mother.

1565
01:03:31,257 --> 01:03:34,177
You can go and see her
whenever you want.

1566
01:03:31,257 --> 01:03:34,177
You can go and see her
whenever you want.

1567
01:03:34,677 --> 01:03:37,764
-I don't wanna have
to go to see her.

1568
01:03:37,764 --> 01:03:40,516
It shouldn't be like that.

1569
01:03:37,764 --> 01:03:40,516
It shouldn't be like that.

1570
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:42,435
-But it is.

1571
01:03:43,644 --> 01:03:45,646
It's not the end of the World.

1572
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:48,191
It just feels like it.

1573
01:03:50,025 --> 01:03:53,571
You're mother and me, we,
uh-- (sighing)

1574
01:03:50,025 --> 01:03:53,571
You're mother and me, we,
uh-- (sighing)

1575
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:59,243
Well, I thought we wanted the
same thing in life,

1576
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:59,243
Well, I thought we wanted the
same thing in life,

1577
01:03:59,243 --> 01:04:03,581
but we don't.

1578
01:03:59,243 --> 01:04:03,581
but we don't.

1579
01:04:03,581 --> 01:04:08,252
We both love you, though. That's
about all I know for sure.

1580
01:04:11,297 --> 01:04:13,591
-I hate this.

1581
01:04:11,297 --> 01:04:13,591
-I hate this.

1582
01:04:15,093 --> 01:04:16,803
-Me, too.

1583
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:19,097
(They sigh)

1584
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:19,097
(They sigh)

1585
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:24,894
-Dad...

1586
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:24,894
-Dad...

1587
01:04:25,937 --> 01:04:28,231
I did something really bad.

1588
01:04:41,702 --> 01:04:43,996
-I'm sorry.

1589
01:04:41,702 --> 01:04:43,996
-I'm sorry.

1590
01:04:43,996 --> 01:04:46,540
-Really. Here.

1591
01:04:50,795 --> 01:04:53,131
You know, his picture's
still in there.

1592
01:04:59,804 --> 01:05:03,349
-And one, more thing.
I wrote him back

1593
01:05:03,349 --> 01:05:07,270
and signed it "From Cal,"
as if I were you.

1594
01:05:03,349 --> 01:05:07,270
and signed it "From Cal,"
as if I were you.

1595
01:05:09,856 --> 01:05:11,774
-Just keep it!

1596
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:17,155
-Cal!

1597
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:22,243
-Stop!

1598
01:05:25,371 --> 01:05:27,290
(grunts)

1599
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:53,274
-Cal! Stop!

1600
01:05:59,363 --> 01:06:00,364
-No!

1601
01:06:00,364 --> 01:06:01,531
-Stop!

1602
01:06:01,531 --> 01:06:02,867
-Come on, let me help you.

1603
01:06:02,867 --> 01:06:04,368
-I don't care!

1604
01:06:02,867 --> 01:06:04,368
-I don't care!

1605
01:06:06,829 --> 01:06:07,955
-You wanna fight? I'll fight!

1606
01:06:07,955 --> 01:06:11,000
-God damn it!

1607
01:06:07,955 --> 01:06:11,000
-God damn it!

1608
01:06:12,376 --> 01:06:16,380
(fighting grunts)

1609
01:06:12,376 --> 01:06:16,380
(fighting grunts)

1610
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:23,179
-I'm sorry, man.

1611
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:25,389
I'm sorry!

1612
01:06:25,932 --> 01:06:27,016
Come on.

1613
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:28,309
-Help me with my bike.

1614
01:06:29,894 --> 01:06:31,395
-Whoo.

1615
01:06:33,147 --> 01:06:35,316
Yeah, man, you actually hurt me.

1616
01:06:33,147 --> 01:06:35,316
Yeah, man, you actually hurt me.

1617
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,319
(chuckles) Good.

1618
01:06:42,073 --> 01:06:44,075
Oh, my letter.

1619
01:06:42,073 --> 01:06:44,075
Oh, my letter.

1620
01:06:44,075 --> 01:06:47,161
I should have written
him back myself.

1621
01:06:47,578 --> 01:06:50,122
-I should have gone
to the funeral.

1622
01:06:47,578 --> 01:06:50,122
-I should have gone
to the funeral.

1623
01:06:50,414 --> 01:06:53,542
-So... what did I write
him about?

1624
01:06:50,414 --> 01:06:53,542
-So... what did I write
him about?

1625
01:06:54,627 --> 01:06:57,213
-What a fun summer you
and I were having.

1626
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:59,006
How we would eat
snow cones for him--

1627
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:59,006
How we would eat
snow cones for him--

1628
01:06:59,006 --> 01:07:01,175
Stuff like that.

1629
01:07:01,175 --> 01:07:03,010
-Yeah, well, know that
he's up in heaven,

1630
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:05,221
he can probably see
everything we're doin'.

1631
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:05,221
he can probably see
everything we're doin'.

1632
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:06,722
-I bet us riding our
bikes into the lake

1633
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:08,099
impressed him.

1634
01:07:08,099 --> 01:07:10,601
(laughing) Oh, yeah,
I'm sure it did.

1635
01:07:08,099 --> 01:07:10,601
(laughing) Oh, yeah,
I'm sure it did.

1636
01:07:11,477 --> 01:07:14,188
You know, did that get
in the water at all?

1637
01:07:11,477 --> 01:07:14,188
You know, did that get
in the water at all?

1638
01:07:14,188 --> 01:07:16,315
It's kind of like he finally
got baptized.

1639
01:07:16,315 --> 01:07:21,070
-Yeah. Wait... this
could work.

1640
01:07:16,315 --> 01:07:21,070
-Yeah. Wait... this
could work.

1641
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:21,910
You're a genius!

1642
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:22,436
You're a genius!

1643
01:07:24,313 --> 01:07:26,023
-Found it.

1644
01:07:27,066 --> 01:07:29,902
-Do you think it even
counts if we do it ourselves?

1645
01:07:30,236 --> 01:07:31,696
-Let's see what it says.

1646
01:07:32,655 --> 01:07:34,365
There it is.

1647
01:07:35,992 --> 01:07:38,035
Does this make any sense to you?

1648
01:07:35,992 --> 01:07:38,035
Does this make any sense to you?

1649
01:07:38,035 --> 01:07:39,328
-None.

1650
01:07:39,328 --> 01:07:42,373
It's not exactly an
instruction manual.

1651
01:07:39,328 --> 01:07:42,373
It's not exactly an
instruction manual.

1652
01:07:43,207 --> 01:07:44,583
-We need help.

1653
01:07:46,377 --> 01:07:48,087
-I ain't a preacher.

1654
01:07:46,377 --> 01:07:48,087
-I ain't a preacher.

1655
01:07:48,087 --> 01:07:50,506
-But you're almost one.
My mom told me.

1656
01:07:50,506 --> 01:07:53,175
-Almost and is ain't the same.

1657
01:07:50,506 --> 01:07:53,175
-Almost and is ain't the same.

1658
01:07:53,676 --> 01:07:55,177
What's all this about?

1659
01:07:55,177 --> 01:07:57,388
-We need to get Zachary
baptized before

1660
01:07:55,177 --> 01:07:57,388
-We need to get Zachary
baptized before

1661
01:07:57,388 --> 01:07:59,015
they take him away
and it's too late.

1662
01:07:59,015 --> 01:08:00,683
-We have to get him
baptized so he can

1663
01:08:00,683 --> 01:08:03,602
get into heaven... to see his
mom.

1664
01:08:00,683 --> 01:08:03,602
get into heaven... to see his
mom.

1665
01:08:03,602 --> 01:08:06,105
-It sounds like you better go
see Reverend Newton.

1666
01:08:06,105 --> 01:08:08,816
-No. He'll make us use
the baptistery in the church.

1667
01:08:06,105 --> 01:08:08,816
-No. He'll make us use
the baptistery in the church.

1668
01:08:08,816 --> 01:08:10,568
-That's how it's done.

1669
01:08:10,568 --> 01:08:13,070
-Zachary wouldn't fit. (sighs)

1670
01:08:10,568 --> 01:08:13,070
-Zachary wouldn't fit. (sighs)

1671
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:15,114
He wouldn't even go for it.

1672
01:08:15,114 --> 01:08:18,117
If word got out,
there'd be a crowd.

1673
01:08:15,114 --> 01:08:18,117
If word got out,
there'd be a crowd.

1674
01:08:18,117 --> 01:08:21,369
-How will you baptize
that boy without a Baptistery?

1675
01:08:21,746 --> 01:08:23,372
-Gossamer Lake.

1676
01:08:21,746 --> 01:08:23,372
-Gossamer Lake.

1677
01:08:23,372 --> 01:08:26,457
-You'd be trespassing.
Besides, somebody might drown.

1678
01:08:26,457 --> 01:08:28,127
-Not if you came.

1679
01:08:26,457 --> 01:08:28,127
-Not if you came.

1680
01:08:28,127 --> 01:08:30,629
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1681
01:08:30,629 --> 01:08:32,381
I don't need the trouble.

1682
01:08:30,629 --> 01:08:32,381
I don't need the trouble.

1683
01:08:33,341 --> 01:08:35,301
(DOG BARKS)

1684
01:08:37,511 --> 01:08:39,346
-Come on, man.
We've got to hurry.

1685
01:08:42,641 --> 01:08:44,435
-I don't even understand this.

1686
01:08:44,435 --> 01:08:46,561
Can you at least explain it?

1687
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:49,689
Matthew 3:14 and 15.

1688
01:08:55,445 --> 01:08:59,283
-Well, yeah. This is about
Jesus tryin' to get

1689
01:08:55,445 --> 01:08:59,283
-Well, yeah. This is about
Jesus tryin' to get

1690
01:08:59,283 --> 01:09:01,284
John the Baptist
to baptize him.

1691
01:09:01,284 --> 01:09:04,330
But John doesn't think he's
good enough.

1692
01:09:01,284 --> 01:09:04,330
But John doesn't think he's
good enough.

1693
01:09:04,747 --> 01:09:06,207
But he's Jesus!

1694
01:09:06,207 --> 01:09:08,542
-So what happens?

1695
01:09:06,207 --> 01:09:08,542
-So what happens?

1696
01:09:08,833 --> 01:09:10,836
-Well, gather up what
stuff you can and I'll--

1697
01:09:10,836 --> 01:09:12,587
I'll send the rest.

1698
01:09:10,836 --> 01:09:12,587
I'll send the rest.

1699
01:09:12,587 --> 01:09:13,964
(dog whimpers)

1700
01:09:13,964 --> 01:09:15,966
Look. I know it's hard,
but it'll go better if

1701
01:09:15,966 --> 01:09:18,302
you cooperate.

1702
01:09:15,966 --> 01:09:18,302
you cooperate.

1703
01:09:18,677 --> 01:09:19,845
"For thus becometh...

1704
01:09:19,845 --> 01:09:22,640
... us to fulfill
righteousness."

1705
01:09:19,845 --> 01:09:22,640
... us to fulfill
righteousness."

1706
01:09:23,181 --> 01:09:24,766
Get it?

1707
01:09:24,766 --> 01:09:27,728
Jesus is sayin', that
by John, doin' the act,

1708
01:09:24,766 --> 01:09:27,728
Jesus is sayin', that
by John, doin' the act,

1709
01:09:27,728 --> 01:09:30,480
he will become
worth of doin' it.

1710
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:32,689
-Um-hm. So he does it.

1711
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:32,689
-Um-hm. So he does it.

1712
01:09:32,689 --> 01:09:33,984
-Of course he does it!

1713
01:09:33,984 --> 01:09:35,819
-Then you'll do it for
Zachary?

1714
01:09:36,362 --> 01:09:38,948
(sighs) I didn't say that.

1715
01:09:36,362 --> 01:09:38,948
(sighs) I didn't say that.

1716
01:09:39,614 --> 01:09:41,951
-We need you, Ferris.
Come on.

1717
01:09:39,614 --> 01:09:41,951
-We need you, Ferris.
Come on.

1718
01:09:41,951 --> 01:09:44,328
Gossamer Lake, five o'clock.

1719
01:09:44,328 --> 01:09:46,705
-Or, we'll try it ourselves,
and God know if...

1720
01:09:46,705 --> 01:09:48,541
... he'll get into
heaven or not.

1721
01:09:46,705 --> 01:09:48,541
... he'll get into
heaven or not.

1722
01:10:13,315 --> 01:10:16,443
-Oh... it's you guys.

1723
01:10:16,902 --> 01:10:18,070
Why are you all dressed up?

1724
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:19,530
-Zachary Beaver, we're
here to take you

1725
01:10:19,530 --> 01:10:21,699
to your baptism.

1726
01:10:22,032 --> 01:10:23,742
-I'm not goin' to any church.

1727
01:10:23,742 --> 01:10:26,495
-You're not.
We're gonna baptize you.

1728
01:10:26,912 --> 01:10:29,665
-How? They're
comin' for me any minute.

1729
01:10:29,665 --> 01:10:32,877
-We have it all
planned out. Trust us.

1730
01:10:29,665 --> 01:10:32,877
-We have it all
planned out. Trust us.

1731
01:10:40,634 --> 01:10:43,345
(yelling) Ferris? Ferris?

1732
01:10:40,634 --> 01:10:43,345
(yelling) Ferris? Ferris?

1733
01:10:45,139 --> 01:10:47,725
Guess we're' gonna have
to do this ourselves.

1734
01:10:45,139 --> 01:10:47,725
Guess we're' gonna have
to do this ourselves.

1735
01:10:54,648 --> 01:10:56,984
-Do you even know
which chapter?

1736
01:10:54,648 --> 01:10:56,984
-Do you even know
which chapter?

1737
01:11:02,531 --> 01:11:06,202
-Sorry I'm late.

1738
01:11:06,202 --> 01:11:09,830
I decided to take
Matthew's word for it.

1739
01:11:06,202 --> 01:11:09,830
I decided to take
Matthew's word for it.

1740
01:11:14,543 --> 01:11:15,711
-Do you prefer the long

1741
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:17,213
or the Short version?

1742
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:17,213
or the Short version?

1743
01:11:17,213 --> 01:11:19,423
-Will the short work
just as well?

1744
01:11:19,423 --> 01:11:21,800
-Yes, sir. It's a personal
preference.

Whosoever believes in him
shall not perish,

1769
01:11:56,669 --> 01:11:59,213
Whosoever believes in him

It's time for your plunge.

-And they'll find

1799
01:13:37,895 --> 01:13:41,190
Better than bein' left in
a tin can in an empty lot.

They'll find you a
good home.

-Away, right Sheriff?

That's the whole point. You

That's the whole point. You
can't leave this boy alone.

1825
01:14:24,108 --> 01:14:27,486
You are the guardian. It's not
legal and it's not right.

1826
01:14:24,108 --> 01:14:27,486
You are the guardian. It's not
legal and it's not right.

1827

Not right? Not right.

Not right? Not right.
Well, all tell ya-- all of you

01:14:33,325 --> 01:14:36,078
what's not right. What's
not right is,

01:14:36,078 --> 01:14:38,580
when I, his guardian, tries to
make a better life

1831
01:14:36,078 --> 01:14:38,580
when I, his guardian, tries to
make a better life

1832
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:43,043
for the kid by expanding
our business.

1833
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:43,043
for the kid by expanding
our business.

1834
01:14:43,043 --> 01:14:46,255
And this insane country,
called Texas,

1835
01:14:46,255 --> 01:14:48,924
throws everything at me, to
stick it to me, to-to-to

1836
01:14:46,255 --> 01:14:48,924

1843
01:14:59,101 --> 01:15:01,895
I'm required to pay
cash--fascist obstacle

I don't have enough.

1845
01:15:01,895 --> 01:15:03,939

I don't have enough.

1846
01:15:03,939 --> 01:15:05,941
So, what do I do? I'm
forced to spend three days

1847
01:15:05,941 --> 01:15:09,361
washing dishes, with no
rights, normally reserved

1848
01:15:05,941 --> 01:15:09,361

of the United States,

1850
01:15:11,071 --> 01:15:12,197
which, apparently I
left when I came

1851
01:15:11,071 --> 01:15:12,197
which, apparently I
left when I came

1852
01:15:12,197 --> 01:15:15,325
to Texas. Then I'm finally
able to make a phone call.

1853
01:15:15,325 --> 01:15:17,703
I dial the number
that he gave me...

1854
01:15:15,325 --> 01:15:17,703
I dial the number
that he gave me...

1855
01:15:17,703 --> 01:15:20,247
No answer, all day!

1856
01:15:20,998 --> 01:15:23,500
-Ferris, did you
remember any calls?

1857
01:15:20,998 --> 01:15:23,500
-Ferris, did you
remember any calls?

1858
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:25,669
-I don't hear phones
so good sometimes.

-So, what can I do?

and turn you loose, or
take him in for abandonment.
