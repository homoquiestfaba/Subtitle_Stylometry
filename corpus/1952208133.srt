00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,529
That's what I'm talking about!

184
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:41,986
- Please leave your name
and wedding date after the beep.

185
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:43,521
[electronic beep]

186
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:46,457
[indistinct recorded speech]

187
00:09:08,513 --> 00:09:11,182
- Ooh.

188
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,384
You dirty old snogger.

189
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,439
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

190
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,442
- I'm okay.

191
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:38,843
- Everything came out
beautifully.

192
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,178
- What the hell is that?

193
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,312
- That's perfect.

194
00:09:41,313 --> 00:09:46,284
- # once in a lifetime #

195
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,418
- Oh, my god.

196
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:51,055
- We were set up on a blind date
by my sister

197
00:09:51,056 --> 00:09:55,193
and her best friend's husband,
who works with Brian.

198
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:58,662
And he walked in the door
of the restaurant,

199
00:09:58,663 --> 00:10:03,468
and I-I kind of had
this really crazy feel--

200
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,403
- Boo!

201
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:14,245
- # just once #

202
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,913
- Ant!

203
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:17,615
Ant!

204
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:18,682
Ant!

205
00:10:18,683 --> 00:10:19,683
- What do you want?

206
00:10:19,684 --> 00:10:22,520
- Come down here, man.

207
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,755
- What are you doing down there?

208
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,160
- Hello.

209
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,328
- What the hell are you doing?

210
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,962
- Dude, do a little dance
for me.

211
00:10:31,963 --> 00:10:33,831
- Can you put that away, please?

212
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:35,333
What are doing touching that?

213
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:36,467
- Dude, check this out, man.

214
00:10:36,468 --> 00:10:38,036
You look like
a freakin' movie star.

215
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:41,305
- Yeah, it's out of focus,
Einstein, real nice.

216
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:42,473
- For the record,

217
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:44,542
when's the last time
you got laid?

218
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:45,976
- All right, give me that.

219
00:10:45,977 --> 00:10:47,145
- Come on, man.

220
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,146
- Give it to me.

221
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,680
- But get me from my good side.

222
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:53,284
Ow.

223
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:54,285
- It's pretty nice.

224
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,719
- I know.

225
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,756
This place is like a frickin'
movie studio over here.

226
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,629
[dog barking]

227
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,199
- All right.

228
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Relax.

229
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:12,170
Yeesh.

230
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,005
Stay out of the ivy,
you bastard.

231
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:21,179
- [laughing]

232
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,947
That's a sweet one.

233
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,256
- Ready, one, two...

234
00:11:32,257 --> 00:11:34,225
[snorts]

235
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:36,094
[laughter]

236
00:11:38,263 --> 00:11:39,897
- Hey!

237
00:11:39,898 --> 00:11:43,201
- Oh, god.

238
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,336
- Hey!

239
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:48,439
Hey.

240
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,476
Who the hell's down here?

241
00:12:05,457 --> 00:12:07,225
What the hell?

242
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,060
[lively music plays]

243
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:12,096
Get up! Get up!

244
00:12:12,097 --> 00:12:14,232
Get out here,
you sons of bitches!

245
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,266
Spread eagle!

246
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,034
Down! Down! Down!

247
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:18,269
[music stops]

248
00:12:19,771 --> 00:12:21,572
What the hell
are you doing here?

249
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:23,274
- We're the guys
from the carpet store.

250
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,243
- I don't give a shit
who you are.

251
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,944
What the hell
are you doing here?

252
00:12:26,945 --> 00:12:28,479
- I was just looking for the--

253
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,681
- Hey, where'd that come from?

254
00:12:30,682 --> 00:12:31,982
- This, I picked that up.

255
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:35,253
- I know where it came from.

256
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,321
You don't touch, you hear me?

257
00:12:37,322 --> 00:12:38,456
- Yeah.

258
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:43,361
Ah!

259
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:44,895
- What's your boss' number?

260
00:12:47,332 --> 00:12:48,666
What is the number?

261
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,201
The number!

262
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:54,705
- Um, it's 555...

263
00:12:57,142 --> 00:12:58,942
5...

264
00:12:58,943 --> 00:13:00,844
5...

265
00:13:00,845 --> 00:13:03,914
5...5.

266
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,884
But let me talk to him,
because--

267
00:13:06,885 --> 00:13:08,752
- Get back down there!

268
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,458
All right,
you want to play games, huh?

269
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:15,726
You want to play games?

270
00:13:15,727 --> 00:13:17,127
I got a game for you.

271
00:13:17,128 --> 00:13:18,529
It's called 911.

272
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,631
- No, sir, please, please,
please don't.

273
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:22,400
Please, please.

274
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,468
We have a perfectly good reason
for being down here.

275
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:27,037
- There is no good reason, pal.

276
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:29,540
- Okay, but just hear me out,
okay?

277
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,541
Just hear me out, please,

278
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:31,909
and then
if you're not satisfied,

279
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,344
you can do whatever, okay?

280
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:34,478
Two minutes.

281
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:35,479
[electronic beep]

282
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,614
- We're sorry.

283
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:40,084
Your call cannot be
completed as dialed.

284
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,285
- Okay, see, what happened was,

285
00:13:41,286 --> 00:13:46,890
this morning,
our father Mr. Marconi...

286
00:13:46,891 --> 00:13:47,891
- Mr. Marconi.

287
00:13:47,892 --> 00:13:49,360
- He's--he's the boss.

288
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,395
And he calls us into his office,
and he says,

289
00:13:51,396 --> 00:13:55,266
"Boys, I want you to shoot
a commercial for the store."

290
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:56,867
- Right, it's on account
of Conte Carpet.

291
00:13:56,868 --> 00:13:59,136
They got this ad campaign,
and they're really killing us.

292
00:13:59,137 --> 00:14:01,872
- Right, and we came down here,
and we saw all the stuff,

293
00:14:01,873 --> 00:14:04,408
and granted, we may have gotten
way ahead of ourselves.

294
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:06,377
- You're damn right you did.

295
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:09,380
- But we see you have the best
equipment here, the best.

296
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:10,648
- Absolutely, man.

297
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:11,782
- Right?
- Yeah.

298
00:14:11,783 --> 00:14:14,585
- Like, you got the cameras
with three chips

299
00:14:14,586 --> 00:14:18,122
and the DVD-VHS
high-speed duping and the--

300
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,490
- Dubbing.

301
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:20,491
- That's what I said, man.

302
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:21,492
- It's called--
- Right.

303
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,861
And you don't touch.

304
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:26,631
You see that baby over there?

305
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,266
Not even on the market yet.

306
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,134
- I know, I know, I know,
he keeps telling me.

307
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,303
He's like, "this stuff
isn't even in stores yet."

308
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,304
- It's very cool.

309
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:34,405
Yeah, but we're impressed.

310
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,506
- Oh, yeah.

311
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,575
You're totally
high-tech here, man.

312
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:43,213
- Yeah, well,
I-I upgraded to HD.

313
00:14:43,214 --> 00:14:45,416
- Yeah.

314
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,950
I bet this bad boy right here,

315
00:14:46,951 --> 00:14:49,654
he probably set you back
more than a few nickels, huh?

316
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:53,056
- That bad boy can do
over 3 million wipes.

317
00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:54,057
- We're very impressed.

318
00:14:54,058 --> 00:14:55,859
- Very impressed.

319
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,261
- There's, you know,

320
00:14:57,262 --> 00:15:00,030
already a few ideas we've been
working on, right, Carm?

321
00:15:00,031 --> 00:15:01,031
- Oh, yeah, quite a few.

322
00:15:01,032 --> 00:15:02,032
- For example.

323
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:07,338
- Picture a boxing ring, okay?

324
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,973
It's made entirely
out of carpet.

325
00:15:09,974 --> 00:15:11,542
Hmm.

326
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:14,011
Now you bring our dad in
who's dressed like a boxer.

327
00:15:14,012 --> 00:15:15,613
He's got the teeth guard, okay?

328
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:19,116
He's got the head gear,
USA shorts, gloves, you know?

329
00:15:19,117 --> 00:15:20,284
Don't tell me.

330
00:15:20,285 --> 00:15:23,954
Ka-boom, he knocks out
the competition, right?

331
00:15:23,955 --> 00:15:24,955
- That's very good, yes.

332
00:15:24,956 --> 00:15:26,123
That's very good.

333
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:28,992
- Palermo Pools did it in '98.

334
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:33,831
- No way.
Really?

335
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:34,898
- Thank you, baby.

336
00:15:36,401 --> 00:15:38,302
Video by Luis.

337
00:15:38,303 --> 00:15:39,470
Yeah, Sasha.
- How you doin'?

338
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,004
- It's this weekend.

339
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:42,840
- I'm Carmine.
This is Anthony.

340
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:45,343
- Ugh.

341
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,110
- Sasha, you're really
hanging me out to dry here.

342
00:15:47,111 --> 00:15:51,749
Yes, of course I need you,
you stupid friggin' polack.

343
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,250
You're not Polish, are you?

344
00:15:53,251 --> 00:15:54,819
Oh, what am I talking about?

345
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,253
Macaroni, right?

346
00:15:56,254 --> 00:15:57,254
You free this weekend?

347
00:15:57,255 --> 00:15:58,789
- This weekend, yeah, yes.

348
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,257
- Actually, we have
a big sale going.

349
00:16:00,258 --> 00:16:02,593
- No, no, don't you be sorry,
Sasha.

350
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:03,761
I'm sorry.

351
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,396
I'm sorry I ever hired

352
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,498
you two friggin' assholes
in the first place!

353
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:08,766
Are you sure?

354
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,668
Because I could really
make it worth your while.

355
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,571
- Yeah, we're sure.

356
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,349
Hey, Pop.

357
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,452
- Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing with that?

358
00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:29,587
- We're building a robot.

359
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,555
- What, is that the computer
from the store?

360
00:16:31,556 --> 00:16:33,824
- Hey, Anthony.

361
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:35,125
I got my inventory on that.

362
00:16:35,126 --> 00:16:36,560
Is that the computer
from the store?

loosen up a little bit.

This ain't a party.

366
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,401

to my ideas, all right,

367
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,402
and relax.

368
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,636
- I'm relaxed.

00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,170
I just don't want this
to take all year.

370
00:16:47,171 --> 00:16:49,373

a grandma with the red sauce?

I'll get him.

Ooh.

- You gonna let me
do all the talking?

the script, though.

we'd like to make.

542
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,027
- Announcement.

543
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:20,730
- We, that is, the honorable
Carmine Francis Marconi...

544
00:23:20,731 --> 00:23:23,100
- God, guys, come on,
cut it out!

545
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,402
It's not a rental over here.

546
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:28,305
- And myself are starting
new careers

547
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:29,539
in the video business.

548
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,407
- With Luis Burns.

549
00:23:31,408 --> 00:23:33,309
- Who the hell is Luis Burns?

550
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:37,547
- He's the island's number one
wedding and event videographer.

551
00:23:37,548 --> 00:23:38,548
- Three years running.

552
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:40,216
- Number one.

553
00:23:40,217 --> 00:23:42,986
- You never thought you had kids
in the movie business, huh, Pa?

554
00:23:44,421 --> 00:23:45,655
- Dominic, Dominic, Dominic.

555
00:23:45,656 --> 00:23:47,457
You remember what we
talked about last night.

556
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:49,225
- They don't want to work
in the store no more,

557
00:23:49,226 --> 00:23:50,527
that's fine, okay?

558
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,796
But they got to kiss the free
room and board good-bye.

559
00:23:52,797 --> 00:23:54,097
You hear me?

560
00:23:54,098 --> 00:23:57,066
From now on, it's gonna be
500 bucks a month each.

561
00:23:57,067 --> 00:23:58,234
Each.

562
00:23:58,235 --> 00:23:59,669
- That's
a frickin' rip-off, Pop.

563
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:00,804
- Oh, well--well, I'm sorry.

564
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:02,372
Then go live with
your new friend there.

565
00:24:02,373 --> 00:24:04,508
What's his name, Louie Burns,
you new pal?

566
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:05,842
Is that the name,
Luis Burns?

567
00:24:05,843 --> 00:24:07,176
What's the matter with you?

568
00:24:07,177 --> 00:24:08,945
- What do you mean,
what's the matter with me?

569
00:24:08,946 --> 00:24:10,847
Who wants what?
You wanted a hot dog?

570
00:24:10,848 --> 00:24:11,948
- You never learn nothing.

571
00:24:11,949 --> 00:24:12,949
- You learn?

572
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,584
You go deal with them.
Go ahead.

573
00:24:14,585 --> 00:24:15,585
Good, go ahead.

574
00:24:15,586 --> 00:24:17,186
Have a good time with them.

575
00:24:17,187 --> 00:24:18,922
Big mouth.

576
00:24:24,094 --> 00:24:25,261
- This is the best thing

577
00:24:25,262 --> 00:24:28,064
that ever could have happened
to us, okay?

578
00:24:28,065 --> 00:24:30,967
- Three grand I'm out
on this dump.

579
00:24:30,968 --> 00:24:34,303
- I said I'm gonna pay you back
for the broker's fee, all right?

580
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,304
What did I tell you?

581
00:24:35,305 --> 00:24:36,406
- And the security deposit.

582
00:24:36,407 --> 00:24:38,441
- Yes, yes,
and the security deposit,

583
00:24:38,442 --> 00:24:40,677
yes, yes.

584
00:24:40,678 --> 00:24:42,412
What I tell you, man?

585
00:24:42,413 --> 00:24:46,583
Uncle Lulu is gonna hook us up.

586
00:24:46,584 --> 00:24:48,585
- What's that smell?

587
00:24:53,591 --> 00:24:56,125
- Ant.

588
00:24:56,126 --> 00:24:58,194
Ant, you know what that is?

589
00:24:58,195 --> 00:24:59,796
- What?
- Do you?

590
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:05,835
That's lobster foo young, man.

591
00:25:05,836 --> 00:25:08,872
That's lobster
frickin' foo young.

592
00:25:11,075 --> 00:25:12,508
- Hurry it up!

593
00:25:12,509 --> 00:25:14,911
Come on, let's go.

594
00:25:14,912 --> 00:25:16,379
I haven't been late
in ten years.

595
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,481
Get in the car.

596
00:25:18,482 --> 00:25:20,316
Shut the door.

597
00:25:22,853 --> 00:25:25,922
All right, listen there,
you, Andrew.

598
00:25:25,923 --> 00:25:27,156
You're in charge of the lights.

599
00:25:27,157 --> 00:25:28,925
This is the signal for on.

600
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:30,927
This is the signal for off,
you got that?

601
00:25:30,928 --> 00:25:32,128
- Got it.

602
00:25:32,129 --> 00:25:33,830
- Why don't you use your signal,
you bastard?

603
00:25:33,831 --> 00:25:35,231
- This is frickin' awesome.

604
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,800
- This means white card.

605
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:39,002
This means bring the ladder,
you got that?

606
00:25:39,003 --> 00:25:41,170
This--this means--
oh, yeah,

607
00:25:41,171 --> 00:25:42,973
Go back and drive in Jersey,
you son of a bitch!

608
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:44,908
- Go back to Jersey,
you stupid fuck!

609
00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:47,410
- Carm, this is serious.

610
00:25:47,411 --> 00:25:50,346
- Dude, I'm establishing
a repartee here.

611
00:25:50,347 --> 00:25:52,248
- And you, jabber jaws.

612
00:25:52,249 --> 00:25:53,449
You're on sound.

613
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,518
I want you to stay close,
but not too close.

614
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:57,520
I want a lot of lead
between me and the camera

615
00:25:57,521 --> 00:25:58,554
and you and the boom mic.

616
00:25:58,555 --> 00:26:00,056
You got that?
- Aye, aye, Skipper.

617
00:26:00,057 --> 00:26:01,691
- And fix your tie.

618
00:26:01,692 --> 00:26:04,393
You look like Dean Martin
on a bender.

619
00:26:04,394 --> 00:26:05,394
[horn honks]

620
00:26:05,395 --> 00:26:08,331
[tires squealing]

621
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,235
Let's go.

622
00:26:12,236 --> 00:26:13,970
- Do you know what the signal
for on is?

623
00:26:13,971 --> 00:26:16,305
Is it the ear wiggle
or the pumping fist?

624
00:26:16,306 --> 00:26:18,207
- Dude, I think we get an entree
at this thing.

625
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:19,208
- Mac!

626
00:26:19,209 --> 00:26:20,710
- Carm, please put that away.

627
00:26:20,711 --> 00:26:22,145
- No, but
just what are you thinking?

628
00:26:22,146 --> 00:26:24,480
You want the prime rib
or the red snapper?

629
00:26:24,481 --> 00:26:27,416
- [clears throat]

630
00:26:31,321 --> 00:26:34,524
You are gonna be my eyes
and my ears.

631
00:26:34,525 --> 00:26:37,127
Everything you see,
everything you hear,

632
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:38,294
I want to know.

633
00:26:38,295 --> 00:26:40,764
Joanne, you're making me
look so good here.

634
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,065
Wonderful job, darling.

635
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:43,566
The most important thing

636
00:26:43,567 --> 00:26:46,202
is that you keep your head
in the game,

637
00:26:46,203 --> 00:26:48,838
because there are no take twos
in this business.

638
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:49,839
You got it?

639
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,240
You screw up, you die.

640
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:52,308
It's that simple.

641
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:53,643
Come on, buddy boys.

642
00:26:53,644 --> 00:26:54,844
- Yo, dude, two o'clock.

643
00:26:58,983 --> 00:27:01,217
- I mean, is it that difficult?

644
00:27:01,218 --> 00:27:03,887
My god.

645
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:04,888
Give me the camera.

646
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:05,955
Give me the camera, please.

647
00:27:05,956 --> 00:27:07,590
Thank you.

648
00:27:07,591 --> 00:27:09,325
- Flash is on.
- Flash is on?

649
00:27:09,326 --> 00:27:10,794
Loaded up?
- Yep.

650
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:14,397
- Andrew, is that the one
with the gear?

651
00:27:14,398 --> 00:27:15,398
- I think so.

652
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:16,599
- What do you mean you think so?

653
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,001
You think so, or you know so.

654
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:19,936
I haven't got time
for guessing games.

655
00:27:19,937 --> 00:27:21,437
- Son, this is
a holy altar here.

656
00:27:21,438 --> 00:27:23,639
- I'm sorry, Father,
that's my fault.

657
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,508
- Father, forgive them.

658
00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:26,843
They know not what they do.

659
00:27:26,844 --> 00:27:29,378
- Carmine, this is a trial run,
you understand?

660
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:30,914
And I'm not going back
to Dad's store

661
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:32,015
with my tail between my legs.

662
00:27:32,016 --> 00:27:33,216
- I know, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

663
00:27:33,217 --> 00:27:34,417
- All right, good.

664
00:27:34,418 --> 00:27:35,484
- I got you.

665
00:27:35,485 --> 00:27:36,886
- You look good, man.
You look good.

666
00:27:36,887 --> 00:27:38,688
- Thanks, man,
you're not bad yourself.

667
00:27:38,689 --> 00:27:39,856
What about that--

668
00:27:39,857 --> 00:27:42,325
- Listen.
- Yeah.

669
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:43,659
- These are your wireless mics.

670
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,895
- Yes.

671
00:27:45,896 --> 00:27:47,964
- And here are your batteries.

672
00:27:47,965 --> 00:27:49,465
Now, I need you
to go get the boom mic

673
00:27:49,466 --> 00:27:51,901
and meet me outside
in five minutes.

674
00:27:51,902 --> 00:27:53,203
- Five minutes.
- Yeah?

675
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:54,204
- Yeah.

676
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:56,172
- All right, thanks.
- I got you.

677
00:27:59,376 --> 00:28:00,543
And the gams,

678
00:28:00,544 --> 00:28:03,713
the gams on that
photography assistant, my god.

679
00:28:03,714 --> 00:28:07,217
It's frickin'--
she's got this, like,

680
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:08,785
librarian thing going on.

681
00:28:08,786 --> 00:28:10,519
I bet she's a firecracker
in the sack.

682
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,223
Hi, how you doin'?

683
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:16,192
You guys know how
to work these things?

684
00:28:16,193 --> 00:28:17,994
- What a day, huh?

685
00:28:17,995 --> 00:28:18,995
Try that.

686
00:28:18,996 --> 00:28:20,130
- What a day, huh?

687
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:21,697
- Good, with more feeling,
and you guys,

688
00:28:21,698 --> 00:28:23,466
you guys, you dust him off
as he says it, okay?

689
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:24,567
Go.

690
00:28:24,568 --> 00:28:25,802
- What a day, huh?
- That's good.

691
00:28:25,803 --> 00:28:27,670
- What an asshole.

692
00:28:27,671 --> 00:28:29,005
- Yeah, yeah, they laugh now.

693
00:28:29,006 --> 00:28:30,774
But wait till they see
the finished product.

694
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:31,841
Then it's gonna be all,

695
00:28:31,842 --> 00:28:33,743
"Mr. Burns,
how did you ever do it?

696
00:28:33,744 --> 00:28:36,246
Oh, Mr. Burns,
isn't that wonderful?"

697
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:37,814
- Yeah, real wonderful.

698
00:28:37,815 --> 00:28:42,618
Like you didn't steal that shot
directly from Bernie Shearer.

699
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:44,220
- Do me a favor.

700
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:46,055
Watch where you're
going today, huh?

701
00:28:46,056 --> 00:28:49,159
- Well, as long as you keep
your lights out of my shot,

702
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,994
we're not gonna have
a problem, are we?

703
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:54,363
- What are we talking about--
- First day, huh?

704
00:28:54,364 --> 00:28:55,364
- What strobe, Lou?

705
00:28:55,365 --> 00:28:57,333
This one, huh?

706
00:28:57,334 --> 00:28:59,269
- She caught him with the
coat check girl at Villa Barone.

707
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,604
- You wish I was 14,
you two-timing son of a bitch.

708
00:29:01,605 --> 00:29:03,807
- Wait, they were a couple?

709
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,374
- Ink's not even dry
on the divorce.

710
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:06,843
- You can talk to my lawyer,

711
00:29:06,844 --> 00:29:08,611
'cause I have got you on tape

712
00:29:08,612 --> 00:29:11,580
with that Latino busboy
from the Chateau Briand.

713
00:29:11,581 --> 00:29:12,816
- Eduardo.

714
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:13,817
- Eduardo, my ass.

715
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:15,351
Consuelo, my ass.

716
00:29:15,352 --> 00:29:16,352
- Come on, let's go.

717
00:29:16,353 --> 00:29:19,689
- I'm all set, Lou.

718
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,124
- All right.

719
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:22,292
What a day, huh?

720
00:29:23,994 --> 00:29:25,695
- Vicky, hey!

721
00:29:25,696 --> 00:29:28,631
[voices overlapping]

722
00:29:29,766 --> 00:29:30,934
- Over here, sweetheart.

723
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,802
You're panicked.
You're scared.

724
00:29:32,803 --> 00:29:33,870
I don't want to get married.

725
00:29:33,871 --> 00:29:34,871
Forget him.

726
00:29:34,872 --> 00:29:35,871
It's me you want.

727
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,906
You want me.

728
00:29:36,907 --> 00:29:37,907
Who's your daddy?

729
00:29:37,908 --> 00:29:40,009
- Smile, Honey.

730
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,410
- Who's a party girl?

731
00:29:41,411 --> 00:29:42,946
Who's a nasty party girl?

732
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:43,947
What's your number?

733
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:44,948
Give me a pout.

734
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,749
I want a pout.

735
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,384
- Carmine, what the hell
are you doing?

736
00:29:48,385 --> 00:29:50,586
- What, man, they got a whole
batch of these things inside.

737
00:29:50,587 --> 00:29:52,922
- Carmine, will you
put those back, please?

738
00:29:52,923 --> 00:29:54,623
- Hey, listen to me.

739
00:29:54,624 --> 00:29:55,959
If it wasn't for me,

740
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,694
you'd be home right now,
reading the help wanted ads.

741
00:29:58,695 --> 00:29:59,695
So leave me alone.

742
00:29:59,696 --> 00:30:01,030
- Are you lecturing me
right now?

743
00:30:01,031 --> 00:30:02,765
- My lawyer says
that I brought Caesar in,

744
00:30:02,766 --> 00:30:04,667
I take Caesar out.

745
00:30:04,668 --> 00:30:06,035
- Oh, yeah?

746
00:30:06,036 --> 00:30:09,372
Where was your lawyer when
Ceezy was making number two

747
00:30:09,373 --> 00:30:10,874
on the living room shag, huh?

748
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,441
- I don't need you
breathing down my neck

749
00:30:12,442 --> 00:30:15,178
every two seconds, okay?

750
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:16,279
I got responsibilities now.

751
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,347
I got things to think about.

752
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:18,547
Hi, how are you?

753
00:30:18,548 --> 00:30:20,116
- What about suppositories, huh?

754
00:30:20,117 --> 00:30:22,318
Are you gonna shove them
up his ass twice a day?

755
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:24,020
- All right, look,
it's like I said.

756
00:30:24,021 --> 00:30:25,922
I get the Benz,
the mutt's yours.

757
00:30:25,923 --> 00:30:27,390
It's your choice, really, Louie.

758
00:30:27,391 --> 00:30:29,259
- Here she goes, here she goes.

759
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,493
- I'm Carmine.

760
00:30:30,494 --> 00:30:31,895
- This is my
homosexual brother...

761
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,662
- [laughs]

762
00:30:33,663 --> 00:30:35,098
- Anthony.

763
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:36,199
He just got out of the closet.

764
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,666
Say--say, hello, Ant.

765
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:39,002
Hey.

766
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,070
- Mac and Jane, yes?

767
00:30:41,071 --> 00:30:42,438
Got it?

768
00:30:42,439 --> 00:30:43,439
- Nice to meet you.

769
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,540
- See you.

770
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:47,810
Why does he keep doing that?
- Andrew!

771
00:30:47,811 --> 00:30:50,380
- Carmine, that's his frickin'
signal for the step ladder.

772
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,148
You didn't see?

773
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:55,051
- This is many things
in many countries.

774
00:30:55,052 --> 00:30:56,252
Dude, relax.

775
00:30:56,253 --> 00:30:57,853
You're gonna break something,
all right?

776
00:30:57,854 --> 00:31:00,290
- That stepladder's crucial
for his big exit shot.

777
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:01,224
- His what?

778
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:05,261
- Carm, his big exit shot,
where he gets up high,

779
00:31:05,262 --> 00:31:06,429
looks out over the guests.

780
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,097
- I'll get high
and look over the guests.

781
00:31:08,098 --> 00:31:10,366
Listen, just relax, man.

782
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:11,700
We got an hour here.
We'll find it.

783
00:31:11,701 --> 00:31:14,070
- Carm, you want to look for it,
be my guest,

784
00:31:14,071 --> 00:31:15,972
because I don't see it.

785
00:31:15,973 --> 00:31:18,574
- Just--

786
00:31:18,575 --> 00:31:21,510
you're talking about the one
with the white stripe, right?

787
00:31:21,511 --> 00:31:23,146
- Yes, the big one,

788
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:24,914
The one he told you
to put in the truck,

789
00:31:24,915 --> 00:31:27,350
the one I saw you holding
in the driveway.

790
00:31:27,351 --> 00:31:31,321
- 'Cause I was waiting for you
to stuff the back seat.

791
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:32,288
Just give me a minute here.

792
00:31:37,294 --> 00:31:39,562
[dog barks]

793
00:31:45,369 --> 00:31:49,973
- Carm, you are about to catch
the beating of a lifetime.

794
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:51,607
- Dude, take it easy, all right?

795
00:31:51,608 --> 00:31:53,709
You can buy 'em for 20 bucks
over at Cost Mart.

796
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,979
- And you're just gonna
waltz out during the ceremony

797
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,546
and go buy one?

798
00:31:57,547 --> 00:31:58,848
- Macaroni, chop chop!

799
00:31:58,849 --> 00:32:00,816
- Just--just--
listen, just give me--

800
00:32:00,817 --> 00:32:02,918
just--just back off, okay?

801
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:04,854
- Yeah, you got it
all under control, don't you?

802
00:32:04,855 --> 00:32:07,290
- Listen, for the last time,
you worry about your job,

803
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:10,626
and I'll worry about mine, okay?

804
00:32:10,627 --> 00:32:11,627
Mr. Big Boss man.

805
00:32:11,628 --> 00:32:12,628
- Hey.

806
00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:13,629
Finally.

807
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:17,467
[church bell ringing]

808
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:20,403
- Yo, Aldo, listen, I need you
to get back to me right away.

809
00:32:20,404 --> 00:32:22,805
911, baby, 911.

810
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,701
- Oh, excuse me.

811
00:32:52,702 --> 00:32:53,702
Here.

812
00:32:53,703 --> 00:32:55,304
That's good. That's good.

813
00:32:55,305 --> 00:32:56,839
- Smile pretty.

814
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,642
- There you go.

815
00:32:59,643 --> 00:33:01,010
Watch the mic.

816
00:33:01,011 --> 00:33:02,178
Stay with me.

817
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:03,179
Stay with me.

818
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,180
Watch the boom.

819
00:33:04,181 --> 00:33:06,149
Get the boom out.

820
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,184
Oh, okay.

821
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,661
- Bless, o lord, this ring

822
00:33:18,662 --> 00:33:23,799
to be a sign of the vows
by which this man and this woman

823
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,901
have bound themselves
to each other

824
00:33:25,902 --> 00:33:29,705
through Jesus Christ
our Lord, amen.

825
00:33:29,706 --> 00:33:32,608
Repeat after me.

826
00:33:32,609 --> 00:33:35,844
Vicky, I give you this ring...

827
00:33:35,845 --> 00:33:37,680
- Vicky, I give you this ring...

828
00:33:37,681 --> 00:33:39,782
- As a symbol of my vow...

829
00:33:39,783 --> 00:33:41,750
- As a symbol of my vow...

830
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:43,953
[cell phone ringing]

831
00:33:43,954 --> 00:33:46,556
- And with all that I am...

832
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:48,124
- And all that I have...

833
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:50,793
- And--and all that I have...

834
00:33:50,794 --> 00:33:52,528
- I honor you...
- I honor you...

835
00:33:52,529 --> 00:33:54,763
[ringing continues]

836
00:33:54,764 --> 00:33:56,432
- In the name of the father...

837
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:57,800
- In the name of the father...

838
00:33:57,801 --> 00:34:03,239
- And of the son...
- And of the son...

839
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,741
- Aldo, buddy, I'm gonna
call you back, okay, pal?

840
00:34:08,078 --> 00:34:09,878
- Don't laugh,
that's something been going on

841
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:11,247
20 years with that idiot.

842
00:34:11,248 --> 00:34:12,781
- Ever consider
maybe you're the idiot

843
00:34:12,782 --> 00:34:14,484
for still working with him?

844
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:16,419
- Ready?
One, two, three.

845
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:19,355
[grunting]

846
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:22,825
- Ow.

847
00:34:22,826 --> 00:34:24,193
- Okay.

848
00:34:24,194 --> 00:34:25,461
Sir, you, sir.

849
00:34:25,462 --> 00:34:26,462
Could you move?

850
00:34:26,463 --> 00:34:27,963
Move, move.

851
00:34:27,964 --> 00:34:29,632
[grunting]

852
00:34:29,633 --> 00:34:30,633
I can't move.

853
00:34:30,634 --> 00:34:32,201
Wait a minute.

854
00:34:32,202 --> 00:34:36,839
- Ow, ow.

855
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,741
Okay, no, no, no.

856
00:34:38,742 --> 00:34:40,776
- Okay, hold on.

857
00:34:40,777 --> 00:34:42,512
- No, this is not working.

858
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:45,047
Where is that
friggin' stepladder?

859
00:34:45,048 --> 00:34:46,449
- Just hold your horses,
all right?

860
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:47,916
- You said that to me
five minutes ago.

861
00:34:47,917 --> 00:34:48,917
[horn honks]

862
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:50,253
- What does this moron want?

863
00:34:54,824 --> 00:34:56,492
- Carmine!

864
00:34:56,493 --> 00:35:00,896
- Okay, so this is
the vision here.

865
00:35:00,897 --> 00:35:03,132
You're gonna float up, like,
I don't know, like, what,

866
00:35:03,133 --> 00:35:04,500
like, 10, 15--

867
00:35:04,501 --> 00:35:05,634
- Maybe 20?

868
00:35:05,635 --> 00:35:08,737
- Maybe 20,
20 feet up in the air, okay?

869
00:35:08,738 --> 00:35:11,607
And then you keep doing that.

870
00:35:11,608 --> 00:35:13,977
But the most important thing
is the timing here, right, Lou?

871
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,544
- Yes, right, right.

872
00:35:15,545 --> 00:35:18,114
- Why couldn't you just have him
buy a new frickin' ladder?

873
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:19,282
- What, are you crazy?

874
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,883
This shot's gonna get us
on the 5:00 news.

875
00:35:20,884 --> 00:35:22,918
- No, this shot is
freaking stupid is what it is.

876
00:35:22,919 --> 00:35:24,520
- What are you calling stupid?

877
00:35:24,521 --> 00:35:27,323
It's ballsy.

878
00:35:27,324 --> 00:35:29,225
I like it.

879
00:35:29,226 --> 00:35:31,127
- You see that?

880
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:33,396
It's ballsy.

881
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:35,764
He likes it.

882
00:35:35,765 --> 00:35:39,768
And maybe you should take notes.

883
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:45,508
Higher, higher, higher,
higher, higher, higher.

884
00:35:45,509 --> 00:35:46,509
Okay, hold right there.

885
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,877
Good, good, good.

886
00:35:47,878 --> 00:35:49,012
Lou, you ready?

887
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:50,313
- I'm rolling.

888
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,514
- Aldo.

889
00:35:51,515 --> 00:35:52,515
- Tell me when, buddy.

890
00:35:52,516 --> 00:35:53,516
- Good man.

891
00:35:53,517 --> 00:35:54,850
- All right, here they come.

892
00:35:54,851 --> 00:35:56,652
- And...
- They're coming.

893
00:35:56,653 --> 00:35:57,586
- Action!

894
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,361
- All right, so--so,

895
00:36:05,362 --> 00:36:08,331
I call this the Hollywood touch.

896
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,865
- Yeah, that's nice.

897
00:36:09,866 --> 00:36:11,267
Put that on your demo reel.

898
00:36:11,268 --> 00:36:12,268
- Demo reel?

899
00:36:12,269 --> 00:36:14,003
I'm talking about the WVAS.

900
00:36:14,004 --> 00:36:15,538
I'm gonna get my belt back.

901
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:18,274
Videographer of the year.

902
00:36:18,275 --> 00:36:20,276
- Don't drop that cake.

903
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,346
- Hey.

904
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,880
Come here, come here.

905
00:36:24,881 --> 00:36:26,315
Nice work.

906
00:36:26,316 --> 00:36:28,051
You really showed me
something out there.

907
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:29,352
- Well, thanks.

908
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,354
I mean, I saw the opportunity
and I took it, you know?

909
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,623
- No, no, no, no,
you listened to what I said.

910
00:36:34,624 --> 00:36:37,660
You kept your ears
and your eyes open.

911
00:36:37,661 --> 00:36:38,661
Now, that's the ticket.

912
00:36:38,662 --> 00:36:41,097
- Video by Luis.

913
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:42,098
- Nice work, video.

914
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,866
- Yeah, well, we got lucky.

915
00:36:43,867 --> 00:36:45,868
- You get yourselves
some hors d'oeuvres,

916
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:48,003
and make sure you eat good.

917
00:36:48,004 --> 00:36:49,372
I don't trust this bastard.

918
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,707
Sometimes he skimps
on the vendor meals.

919
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:53,876
- 10-4, Lou, 10-4.

920
00:36:53,877 --> 00:36:56,212
- Hey, Trixie, Trixie.

921
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:57,713
Come here, come here,
come here.

922
00:36:57,714 --> 00:37:01,984
- I want you to get a photo
of me and my new lift rig

923
00:37:01,985 --> 00:37:03,286
for my website, all right?

924
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:05,388
- Sorry, Lou, I'm all packed up.

925
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,190
- Oh.

926
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:10,059
- Hey, try that on for size.

927
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:13,563
- Joe, I'm telling you,
this kid is so on the ball.

928
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,365
- Let's go, put a little pep
in your step.

929
00:37:19,636 --> 00:37:21,571
- Video by Luis.
- Thank you.

930
00:37:25,909 --> 00:37:28,344
- Ooh.

931
00:37:28,345 --> 00:37:29,612
I work with him.

932
00:37:29,613 --> 00:37:30,913
What's going on with that girl?

933
00:37:30,914 --> 00:37:32,748
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

934
00:37:32,749 --> 00:37:35,151
- All right, Macaronis,
it's show time.

935
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,685
Go!

936
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,956
- Vicky and Bobby!

937
00:37:40,957 --> 00:37:43,259
- Where is he?

938
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,693
- I told you, asshole.

939
00:37:44,694 --> 00:37:47,130
- All right, come on, come on,
come on.

940
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:54,403
- You guys are related somehow?

941
00:37:54,404 --> 00:37:55,404
- We're sisters.

942
00:37:55,405 --> 00:37:56,672
- Get out of here.

943
00:37:56,673 --> 00:37:57,973
- Sisters, Lou.

944
00:37:57,974 --> 00:37:59,375
- All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

945
00:37:59,376 --> 00:38:00,943
Hope everyone is enjoying
their salad.

946
00:38:00,944 --> 00:38:02,612
In just a few moments--

947
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:03,979
- Holy shit.

948
00:38:07,584 --> 00:38:09,084
- All right,
at this point in time,

949
00:38:09,085 --> 00:38:11,187
We need to get
all the single ladies out here

950
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:13,722
onto the dance floor.

951
00:38:13,723 --> 00:38:15,358
- Classy fuckin' joint.

952
00:38:18,428 --> 00:38:20,263
Yeah, I'm a natural.

953
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,165
I'm thinking
about doing commercials.

954
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:25,535
I'm thinking about doing
maybe independent films.

955
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,935
I'm thinking
about getting into--

956
00:38:26,936 --> 00:38:28,304
- You know, I come from films.

957
00:38:28,305 --> 00:38:29,639
- You're kidding.

958
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,507
- Yeah, I did
a lot of movies first.

959
00:38:31,508 --> 00:38:35,478
I was assistant director
of photography

960
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,280
on a lot of the films
that were done in New York.

961
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:38,981
I couldn't take the bull,

962
00:38:38,982 --> 00:38:42,051
and that's why I more or less,
yeah--

963
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:43,386
I more or less run into the--

964
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:44,387
- How you doin'?

965
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:45,454
- Out of my way, Vidiot.

966
00:38:45,455 --> 00:38:47,456
- Have you two
ever done any acting?

967
00:38:47,457 --> 00:38:50,125
I could do
some very special videos

968
00:38:50,126 --> 00:38:51,927
That would include
the two of you together.

969
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,565
- You got to try this cake here.

970
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,966
It's a coconut cream filling.

971
00:38:57,967 --> 00:38:59,402
It's out of this world.

972
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:01,970
- Yeah, did you pick up the
wheelchair from the truck yet?

973
00:39:01,971 --> 00:39:04,106
- Anthony, you got to relax,
man.

974
00:39:04,107 --> 00:39:05,107
This is all good.

975
00:39:05,108 --> 00:39:06,775
- No, Carm, it's not all good.

976
00:39:06,776 --> 00:39:07,776
You know why?

977
00:39:07,777 --> 00:39:08,977
Because you get to screw around

978
00:39:08,978 --> 00:39:10,279
and have the time of your life,

979
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,747
and I'm stuck here
doing all the work.

980
00:39:11,748 --> 00:39:12,915
It's bullshit.

981
00:39:12,916 --> 00:39:15,685
- Can we get him
a Jack and coke, please?

982
00:39:18,455 --> 00:39:19,922
What are you writing here?

983
00:39:19,923 --> 00:39:20,923
Dildo guide to the galaxy?

984
00:39:20,924 --> 00:39:22,692
- Give it back.
I'm not done.

985
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,193
- "No cell phone.

986
00:39:24,194 --> 00:39:25,494
"No flirting.

987
00:39:25,495 --> 00:39:28,664
No drinking."

988
00:39:28,665 --> 00:39:30,433
What the hell is this shit, man?

989
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,501
- If you and I are going
to continue working together,

990
00:39:32,502 --> 00:39:34,737
you have to start holding up
your end of the load.

991
00:39:34,738 --> 00:39:37,106
- Dude, did I or did I not
just go out there

992
00:39:37,107 --> 00:39:38,708
and blow the doors off of Lou?

993
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,009
- No, what you did, Carmine,
was get lucky,

994
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,511
and that's it.

995
00:39:42,512 --> 00:39:43,546
- Is that right?

996
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,013
- Either you sign this,

997
00:39:45,014 --> 00:39:47,883
or you can move your stuff
out of my apartment.

998
00:39:52,655 --> 00:39:54,356
Look, this is not
up for debate.

999
00:39:54,357 --> 00:39:55,824
- I don't know, man.

1000
00:39:55,825 --> 00:39:57,893
I don't think this is gonna
hold up in the court of law.

1001
00:39:57,894 --> 00:39:58,894
- Why not?

1002
00:39:58,895 --> 00:39:59,995
- I have a problem

1003
00:39:59,996 --> 00:40:03,132
with this hidden clause
on the back here.

1004
00:40:03,133 --> 00:40:05,634
Maybe it's just me,

1005
00:40:05,635 --> 00:40:09,105
but I didn't think they had
that sparkle on the altar.

1006
00:40:27,424 --> 00:40:28,357
- You okay?

1007
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:34,330
- Just please, please tell me
this thing's almost done.

1008
00:40:36,566 --> 00:40:39,201
- Bet you're missing
that tile store now, huh?

1009
00:40:40,303 --> 00:40:41,437
- It was carpet, actually.

1010
00:40:41,438 --> 00:40:43,739
But, yeah,
now that you mention it, I am.

1011
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,740
- Let's go.

1012
00:40:44,741 --> 00:40:45,741
Let's get this cleaned up.

1013
00:40:45,742 --> 00:40:46,842
I need dishes. I need plates.

1014
00:40:46,843 --> 00:40:47,843
I need equipment.

1015
00:40:47,844 --> 00:40:49,612
What are we running over here?

1016
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:50,912
Move it around, let's go.

1017
00:40:50,913 --> 00:40:52,381
Oh, oh!

1018
00:40:52,382 --> 00:40:53,315
Easy, easy.

1019
00:40:54,451 --> 00:40:55,851
[glass shatters]

1020
00:40:55,852 --> 00:40:56,852
- What's up with your boss?

1021
00:40:56,853 --> 00:40:59,188
She--is she sick or something?

1022
00:40:59,189 --> 00:41:01,957
- Mai Tai fever is more like it.

1023
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:02,958
- Oh, that's nice.

1024
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:04,260
She leaves you
with all the work.

1025
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:05,528
That's good.

1026
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:08,130
- It's not that bad.

1027
00:41:08,131 --> 00:41:12,535
Actually, it's good practice,
you know,

1028
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:14,136
for when I go out on my own.

1029
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:17,640
- You know, I could--

1030
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:18,641
When you do that,

1031
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,108
I could help you
with your marketing.

1032
00:41:20,109 --> 00:41:21,243
- Oh, yeah?

1033
00:41:21,244 --> 00:41:24,046
You do a little--
do a little marketing?

1034
00:41:24,047 --> 00:41:27,082
- No, no, it's just--

1035
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:29,051
it's what
I went to school for.

1036
00:41:29,052 --> 00:41:30,486
- Oh, you went to college.

1037
00:41:32,088 --> 00:41:33,088
- Yeah, why?

1038
00:41:33,089 --> 00:41:34,356
Does that surprise you?

1039
00:41:34,357 --> 00:41:36,458
- No, I just thought maybe
this was some kind of

1040
00:41:36,459 --> 00:41:38,860
work release program
or something.

1041
00:41:47,237 --> 00:41:48,937
- I-I forgot your name already.

1042
00:41:48,938 --> 00:41:49,938
- No, you didn't.

1043
00:41:49,939 --> 00:41:50,939
Come on.

1044
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,940
- I'm bad with names.

1045
00:41:51,941 --> 00:41:54,476
It's--it was--

1046
00:41:54,477 --> 00:41:55,877
just give me a second.

1047
00:41:55,878 --> 00:41:58,681
Uh...

1048
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,682
Andrew.

1049
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,584
- No, no.

1050
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:02,585
Anthony.

1051
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:03,586
Anthony Marconi.

1052
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:06,589
- Yoo-hoo.

1053
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,324
Hoo-hee-hee.
[laughs]

1054
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:09,325
Hey, come on, man.

1055
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:11,093
We got to do
that champagne shot.

1056
00:42:11,094 --> 00:42:13,462
- Why don't you do it?

1057
00:42:13,463 --> 00:42:15,664
- Because they need
the two of us, that's why.

1058
00:42:15,665 --> 00:42:16,898
- Well, I'm busy.

1059
00:42:18,968 --> 00:42:19,901
- What?

1060
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:29,845
You heard me.

1061
00:42:29,846 --> 00:42:31,347
- You gonna be
a little baby now?

1062
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:35,016
'Cause I didn't sign
your stupid little napkin there?

1063
00:42:35,017 --> 00:42:36,452
There you go.

1064
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:38,621
I'm sorry for everything
I ever did for you

1065
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:39,555
or to you.

1066
00:42:40,923 --> 00:42:42,224
- Look, you were right.

1067
00:42:42,225 --> 00:42:43,492
You got to worry about your job.

1068
00:42:43,493 --> 00:42:44,793
I'll worry about mine.

1069
00:42:44,794 --> 00:42:46,027
- This is bullshit, man.

1070
00:42:46,028 --> 00:42:47,863
We got, like, a dozen shots
to knock off here.

1071
00:42:47,864 --> 00:42:50,499
- Hey, you're the boy genius,
right?

1072
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,800
You'll figure it out.

1073
00:42:51,801 --> 00:42:53,902
- Hey, don't make me
come looking for you.

1074
00:42:53,903 --> 00:42:54,903
Will you come on?

1075
00:42:54,904 --> 00:42:55,971
Come on!
- Better hurry up.

1076
00:42:55,972 --> 00:42:57,339
Uncle Lou sounds pissed.

1077
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,208
Have fun.
- Yeah, you have fun too.

1078
00:43:00,209 --> 00:43:04,079
- See you.
- Yeah.

1079
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,814
I got your number, chico.

1080
00:43:05,815 --> 00:43:07,750
- Yeah, well, I got yours.

1081
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:12,688
- Hey, Trixie.

1082
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:15,023
- [laughs]

1083
00:43:15,024 --> 00:43:16,592
- I'm going to get a drink;
you want one?

1084
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:19,595
- Yeah, yeah.

1085
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:28,637
- Cut, cut.

1086
00:43:28,638 --> 00:43:29,672
We're gonna have to do

1087
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:31,540
what they call
a take two on this.

1088
00:43:31,541 --> 00:43:33,342
- Wait, I'm confused.

1089
00:43:33,343 --> 00:43:39,114
- Okay, it's, um, smile, clink,
kiss, and hold it for five.

1090
00:43:39,115 --> 00:43:40,115
You got it?

1091
00:43:40,116 --> 00:43:44,553
- Wait, smile, clink, kiss.

1092
00:43:44,554 --> 00:43:46,488
- And hold for five.

1093
00:43:49,091 --> 00:43:51,126
[together]
One, two, three, four,

1094
00:43:51,127 --> 00:43:53,662
I declare a thumb war.

1095
00:43:56,399 --> 00:43:57,599
- [laughs]

1096
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,600
Oh, but that--no.

1097
00:43:58,601 --> 00:43:59,935
- What are you talking about?

1098
00:43:59,936 --> 00:44:02,137
- That wasn't even allowed
because you pulled it.

1099
00:44:02,138 --> 00:44:03,138
- No, I didn't.

1100
00:44:03,139 --> 00:44:04,139
I was in the ring.

1101
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,140
- You opened the fist.

1102
00:44:05,141 --> 00:44:06,575
- That was rope-a-dope.

1103
00:44:06,576 --> 00:44:09,110
That was rope-a-dope.

1104
00:44:09,111 --> 00:44:10,111
[laughter]

1105
00:44:10,112 --> 00:44:11,814
Come on.

1106
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,982
[together]
One, two, three, four,

1107
00:44:13,983 --> 00:44:16,218
I declare a thumb war.

1108
00:44:25,094 --> 00:44:26,328
- Let go.

1109
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:36,171
- Hey, Romeo,
your boss is looking for you.

1110
00:44:36,172 --> 00:44:38,206
- Thanks.

1111
00:44:38,207 --> 00:44:39,575
- I got to--
I'll see you tomorrow.

1112
00:44:42,144 --> 00:44:44,112
[horn honks]

1113
00:44:46,182 --> 00:44:47,182
- Wait, wait, wait.

1114
00:44:47,183 --> 00:44:48,617
- Oh, what a ditz.

1115
00:44:48,618 --> 00:44:50,118
Ten takes on this one.

1116
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:51,119
Oh, jeez.

1117
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,988
- True.

1118
00:44:52,989 --> 00:44:57,025
But look at those sweet,
sweet tee-tas.

1119
00:44:57,026 --> 00:44:59,928
- Forget about the tee-tas,
you idiot.

1120
00:44:59,929 --> 00:45:00,929
Listen to that sound.

1121
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:01,930
You hear that?

1122
00:45:01,931 --> 00:45:02,931
[static crackling]

1123
00:45:02,932 --> 00:45:04,199
- I'm sorry, no.

1124
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,268
- Listen.

1125
00:45:06,269 --> 00:45:08,570
That is weak batteries
in a wireless mic.

1126
00:45:08,571 --> 00:45:10,706
Now, what did I tell you?

1127
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:11,807
- I'm sorry, Lou.

1128
00:45:11,808 --> 00:45:13,275
When in doubt,
you change 'em out.

1129
00:45:13,276 --> 00:45:15,977
- Memorize that.
- Never happen again.

1130
00:45:15,978 --> 00:45:18,580
- It better not, because
I'm gonna need you two here

1131
00:45:18,581 --> 00:45:20,248
tomorrow morning at 11:00,

1132
00:45:20,249 --> 00:45:22,718
the same shoes, the same pants,
the same shirt,

1133
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:25,387
and don't forget
those silver bow ties,

1134
00:45:25,388 --> 00:45:28,123
'cause that's the team look.

1135
00:45:28,124 --> 00:45:31,827
- So does that mean
that we're on the team, Lou?

1136
00:45:31,828 --> 00:45:34,897
- Yeah, you're on the team.

1137
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,732
All right, now, make sure
you're up plenty early.

1138
00:45:37,733 --> 00:45:40,068
Come on, I'm gonna
count up the money, let's go.

1139
00:45:40,069 --> 00:45:41,469
- A hundred.
- A hundred.

1140
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:42,470
- 115.

1141
00:45:42,471 --> 00:45:43,605
- Hundred papa.

1142
00:45:43,606 --> 00:45:45,440
- $200.
- $200.

1143
00:45:45,441 --> 00:45:46,641
- You are a smart ass.

1144
00:45:46,642 --> 00:45:48,443
$250.
- $250.

1145
00:45:48,444 --> 00:45:49,878
- $300.
- $300.

1146
00:45:49,879 --> 00:45:51,880
- Stop imitating me.
- Stop imitating me.

1147
00:45:51,881 --> 00:45:54,817
[crowd cheering]

1148
00:45:56,419 --> 00:45:57,719
- Oh, Carm.

1149
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,788
- Timmy!

1150
00:45:59,789 --> 00:46:01,389
Fusco, you fuckin' prick!

1151
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:03,826
[laughs]

1152
00:46:05,061 --> 00:46:06,528
- I'm gonna fucking kill you.

1153
00:46:08,497 --> 00:46:09,497
- Dude, I'm sorry.

1154
00:46:09,498 --> 00:46:12,201
It's--it's--

1155
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:15,704
I thought we'd throw a little,
you know, soiree,

1156
00:46:15,705 --> 00:46:17,005
celebrate the big move.

1157
00:46:17,006 --> 00:46:18,106
You know, I--

1158
00:46:18,107 --> 00:46:21,243
- There's over 50 people here,
Carmine.

1159
00:46:23,512 --> 00:46:26,281
He said we have
an 11:00 A.M. job.

1160
00:46:26,282 --> 00:46:27,449
- We got time.

1161
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:29,117
It's, like,
a million hours from now.

1162
00:46:29,118 --> 00:46:33,322
- No, it's, like,
12 hours from now.

1163
00:46:34,757 --> 00:46:37,259
- It's actually, like,
ten hours from now.

1164
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,494
- What did we agree to?

1165
00:46:39,495 --> 00:46:41,964
I mean, our contract
specifically states

1166
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,699
that you'll be in bed
before midnight at an A.M. job.

1167
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:45,767
[knocks on window]

1168
00:46:45,768 --> 00:46:47,569
- Come on, Carmine,
I'm getting wet.

1169
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:49,304
- And god willing, I will be.

1170
00:46:56,712 --> 00:46:59,147
[crowd cheering]

1171
00:47:00,316 --> 00:47:03,118
- [screams]

1172
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:06,054
[voices overlapping]

1173
00:47:13,229 --> 00:47:16,164
Good game, good game,
good game.

1174
00:47:21,137 --> 00:47:22,737
- Oh!
- Yo, Marconi.

1175
00:47:22,738 --> 00:47:24,539
A little privacy in here?

1176
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:28,743
- Well, that's not gonna work
on this girl.

1177
00:47:28,744 --> 00:47:30,946
- Why not?

1178
00:47:30,947 --> 00:47:32,147
- Because she's smart.

1179
00:47:32,148 --> 00:47:34,582
She's not like
all your freaking bimbos.

1180
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:38,820
- So why don't you ask her out
on a frickin' date?

1181
00:47:38,821 --> 00:47:39,821
- I don't know, man.

1182
00:47:39,822 --> 00:47:40,923
What do you want from me?

1183
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:42,057
You know I move slow.

1184
00:47:42,058 --> 00:47:45,827
Look how long it took me
to leave the store.

1185
00:47:45,828 --> 00:47:47,996
Well, at least
you did that, man.

1186
00:47:47,997 --> 00:47:49,564
- I don't know.

1187
00:47:49,565 --> 00:47:51,233
I don't know.

1188
00:47:51,234 --> 00:47:53,068
I don't know.

1189
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:55,370
- So what?

1190
00:47:55,371 --> 00:47:56,371
So she's smart.

1191
00:47:56,372 --> 00:47:57,372
So what, man?

1192
00:47:57,373 --> 00:47:59,707
- She graduated
top of her class at NYU.

1193
00:47:59,708 --> 00:48:05,213
- So you got that salutation
thing from Crappy Johns.

1194
00:48:05,214 --> 00:48:08,483
- Salutatorian.

1195
00:48:08,484 --> 00:48:09,985
- That's what I said.

1196
00:48:09,986 --> 00:48:11,219
That's second place, man.

1197
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,221
Your kids are gonna be, like,
frickin' nerds.

1198
00:48:13,222 --> 00:48:16,724
Seriously, though,
let's say, like,

1199
00:48:16,725 --> 00:48:20,595
you get hitched with this girl,
and things work out,

1200
00:48:20,596 --> 00:48:23,565
I hope
that you will consider--

1201
00:48:23,566 --> 00:48:28,170
still consider asking me
to be your best man.

1202
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:29,438
- Okay, Carm.

1203
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,974
- For real, though, because

1204
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:34,742
tonight at the wedding,
I hated that.

1205
00:48:34,743 --> 00:48:36,511
You know,
when the brother's there,

1206
00:48:36,512 --> 00:48:38,213
and he's in the groom's
bridal party,

1207
00:48:38,214 --> 00:48:41,149
and--and, you know,
some other jerk is the best man.

1208
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:43,018
I-I mean, that's not cool.

1209
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:44,586
You know,
that's his frickin' brother.

1210
00:48:44,587 --> 00:48:46,154
- Carm.

1211
00:48:46,155 --> 00:48:48,723
- I want you to promise me.

1212
00:48:48,724 --> 00:48:50,492
I want you to promise me.

1213
00:48:50,493 --> 00:48:51,693
- Will you go to bed?
- Promise.

1214
00:48:51,694 --> 00:48:52,694
- Will you go to bed?

1215
00:48:52,695 --> 00:48:54,062
- I'll go to bed.
Promise.

1216
00:48:54,063 --> 00:48:55,597
- Okay, you can be my best man.

1217
00:48:55,598 --> 00:48:56,698
- Okay.
- All right.

1218
00:48:56,699 --> 00:49:02,770
- Okay, okay.

1219
00:49:02,771 --> 00:49:03,771
But what about L.J.?

1220
00:49:03,772 --> 00:49:04,772
'Cause you--

1221
00:49:04,773 --> 00:49:06,308
- Go to bed!

1222
00:49:06,309 --> 00:49:09,444
- You guys were tight
in high school.

1223
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:15,183
- I see you're living
like real kings over here.

1224
00:49:15,184 --> 00:49:16,751
- Dad, if you came over here
to argue,

1225
00:49:16,752 --> 00:49:18,120
I really don't have time.

1226
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,821
- Got any of that braciola
from last Sunday?

1227
00:49:19,822 --> 00:49:21,556
- Oh, ho, ho,
that's how you greet me?

1228
00:49:23,626 --> 00:49:26,428
The chicken you can just
put in the microwave.

1229
00:49:26,429 --> 00:49:28,796
- You know, Anthony,
I know you probably think

1230
00:49:28,797 --> 00:49:31,900
that I'm a royal
pain in the ass, okay?

1231
00:49:31,901 --> 00:49:35,803
I mean, I thought my father
was a pain in the ass,

1232
00:49:35,804 --> 00:49:36,871
and I'm sure that he thought

1233
00:49:36,872 --> 00:49:38,573
his father was
a pain in the ass too.

1234
00:49:38,574 --> 00:49:40,942
- Great, we come from a long
line of pains in the asses.

1235
00:49:40,943 --> 00:49:42,144
- Ooh.
- How did it go?

1236
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,145
- Oh, mommy.

1237
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,146
- Carmine, how did--

1238
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,980
- Oh, mommy.

1239
00:49:45,981 --> 00:49:47,349
- Would you stop doing that

1240
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:48,583
and look at me
for a minute here?

1241
00:49:48,584 --> 00:49:49,817
- What?

1242
00:49:49,818 --> 00:49:52,521
- Last night, I sat down
with your uncle, you hear?

1243
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:53,755
And we talked it over,

1244
00:49:53,756 --> 00:49:56,791
and we decided
we'll let you two on the floor.

1245
00:49:56,792 --> 00:49:59,594
- Give me a kiss.

1246
00:49:59,595 --> 00:50:00,595
- Like an angel.

1247
00:50:00,596 --> 00:50:01,596
Like an angel of mercy.

1248
00:50:01,597 --> 00:50:02,597
- Where's your pants?

1249
00:50:02,598 --> 00:50:04,666
- Assistant Manager of Sales.

1250
00:50:06,936 --> 00:50:10,138
No more wall to wall,
no more banging carpet.

1251
00:50:10,139 --> 00:50:13,075
And when it's slow,
you can even do some of that--

1252
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:15,110
That "A" and "P" stuff.

1253
00:50:15,111 --> 00:50:16,311
Okay?

1254
00:50:16,312 --> 00:50:19,114
What do you say?

1255
00:50:19,115 --> 00:50:20,248
What do you say?

1256
00:50:20,249 --> 00:50:21,683
- Hey, you're not
even dressed yet?

1257
00:50:21,684 --> 00:50:23,585
- Relax, Ant, these things
don't get started till noon.

1258
00:50:23,586 --> 00:50:25,120
[phone rings]
- You want me to get that?

1259
00:50:25,121 --> 00:50:26,121
- What are we doing here?

1260
00:50:26,122 --> 00:50:28,490
Are we talking here or what?

1261
00:50:28,491 --> 00:50:30,292
- Dad, that's a really nice
offer and all,

1262
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:32,561
but this time we got to pass.

1263
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:33,962
- Yeah, we got
new careers now, Dad.

1264
00:50:33,963 --> 00:50:35,464
- Will you go in there
and change?

1265
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:38,133
- Marconi Video.

1266
00:50:38,134 --> 00:50:40,235
Carmine is not here right now.

1267
00:50:40,236 --> 00:50:41,869
- Anthony.

1268
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:44,172
I'm two short in the field.

1269
00:50:44,173 --> 00:50:45,640
You guys don't come back
by tomorrow,

1270
00:50:45,641 --> 00:50:47,375
I got no other choice.

1271
00:50:47,376 --> 00:50:50,979
I'm hiring some new guys.

1272
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,914
- What the hell
kind of message is that?

1273
00:50:52,915 --> 00:50:55,283
Macaroni, where in the damn hell
are you?

1274
00:50:55,284 --> 00:50:56,284
I am at the church.

1275
00:50:56,285 --> 00:50:57,419
The bride's here,

1276
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:00,989
and I'm short
a couple of assholes.

1277
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:01,990
- Fix your--

1278
00:51:01,991 --> 00:51:02,924
fix your--

1279
00:51:11,367 --> 00:51:12,667
- What's up, Lou?
How you doing?

1280
00:51:12,668 --> 00:51:13,835
- What part of 11:00

1281
00:51:13,836 --> 00:51:15,570
don't you two brainiacs
understand?

1282
00:51:15,571 --> 00:51:16,638
- I'm so sorry, Lou.

1283
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:17,639
Traffic on the belt.

1284
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,640
- The belt.

1285
00:51:18,641 --> 00:51:19,707
I'm gonna give you a belt.

1286
00:51:19,708 --> 00:51:21,042
Now, you get
the light's started.

1287
00:51:21,043 --> 00:51:22,277
Go!

1288
00:51:22,278 --> 00:51:24,279
You, you're gonna need
wireless mics,

1289
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,980
because I'm gonna be stuck up
in the rafters

1290
00:51:25,981 --> 00:51:28,283
because of that--that meat
and potatoes monsignor prick.

1291
00:51:28,284 --> 00:51:29,984
Go.
Wireless mics, wireless mics.

1292
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:36,958
- Pamela and Joseph.

1293
00:51:36,959 --> 00:51:40,428
Today marks the beginning
of a new adventure...

1294
00:51:40,429 --> 00:51:41,429
- Psst!

1295
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:42,764
- An adventure that,
god willing,

1296
00:51:42,765 --> 00:51:45,167
will take you
through your life together.

1297
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:47,502
- Listen, don't sweat it, man.

1298
00:51:47,503 --> 00:51:48,836
You got time, all right?
- Shh!

1299
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,907
- Pamela, repeat after me.

1300
00:51:52,908 --> 00:51:55,043
I, Pamela...
- I, Pamela...

1301
00:51:55,044 --> 00:51:56,044
- Take you, Joseph...

1302
00:51:56,045 --> 00:51:57,078
- Take you, Joseph...

1303
00:51:57,079 --> 00:51:59,047
- To be
my lawful wedded husband.

1304
00:51:59,048 --> 00:52:01,849
- To be my lawful
wedded husband.

1305
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:04,786
[static crackling]

1306
00:52:10,993 --> 00:52:11,993
- For poorer.

1307
00:52:11,994 --> 00:52:12,994
- Richer or for poor--

1308
00:52:12,995 --> 00:52:13,995
[static crackling]

1309
00:52:13,996 --> 00:52:15,129
- Death--part.

1310
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:17,232
- Death do us part.

1311
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:19,401
- Joseph, repeat--

1312
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:22,437
[indistinct radio chatter]

1313
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:25,173
- Shit.

1314
00:52:25,174 --> 00:52:27,542
- Let me listen.

1315
00:52:27,543 --> 00:52:28,710
Let me listen.

1316
00:52:36,352 --> 00:52:37,352
- Deep drive!

1317
00:52:37,353 --> 00:52:38,520
It could go--

1318
00:52:38,521 --> 00:52:41,756
[thunder booms]

1319
00:52:41,757 --> 00:52:43,058
A home run!

1320
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:46,061
A home run over the deepest part
of left center field.

1321
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:49,464
- You're a fucking moron.

1322
00:52:49,465 --> 00:52:51,166
How could you forget
something like that?

1323
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:52,601
- I don't know.

1324
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:53,802
- You don't know?

1325
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:54,803
You don't know?

1326
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:56,705
I saw him give you
the batteries.

1327
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:57,939
- I got confused, man.

1328
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,374
I-I thought I changed them out.

1329
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:00,542
- You got confused?

1330
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,776
That's his golden rule.

1331
00:53:01,777 --> 00:53:05,080
When in doubt,
change 'em out.

1332
00:53:05,081 --> 00:53:06,147
- Damn it, Carm!

1333
00:53:06,148 --> 00:53:07,982
- All right, just take it easy.

1334
00:53:07,983 --> 00:53:11,553
- No, you fuckin' take it easy
and get focused.

1335
00:53:11,554 --> 00:53:13,255
- I'm focused.

1336
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:15,257
Maybe it's the headphones.

1337
00:53:15,258 --> 00:53:16,391
- It's not the--

1338
00:53:16,392 --> 00:53:18,893
- Brought to you by our friends
at Conte Carpet.

1339
00:53:18,894 --> 00:53:21,162
For low, low prices
and Quality--

1340
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,933
C-O-N-T-E.

1341
00:53:24,934 --> 00:53:27,936
That is 555-CONTE.

1342
00:53:27,937 --> 00:53:29,003
- Don't give me this.

1343
00:53:34,143 --> 00:53:35,944
- Hey, Macaronis, let's go.

1344
00:53:35,945 --> 00:53:37,846
They're starting the intros.

1345
00:53:40,182 --> 00:53:42,217
- Hey, boss man.

1346
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:43,818
What you working on in there?

1347
00:53:43,819 --> 00:53:49,224
HI8, MiniDV, High Definition?

1348
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:52,127
- Not now, okay, pal?

1349
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:54,829
- Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my honor and privilege

1350
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:58,099
to introduce to you for the
first time as husband and wife.

1351
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,368
Please make some noise

1352
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:04,373
for the new Mr. And Mrs.
Joseph and Pam Pitalko.

1353
00:54:07,843 --> 00:54:08,843
- Good, watch the mic.

1354
00:54:08,844 --> 00:54:10,512
Get the boom out.

1355
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:12,013
- We just got to tell him, man.

1356
00:54:12,014 --> 00:54:13,248
- No, man.

1357
00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:16,017
I don't think
that's a good idea.

1358
00:54:16,018 --> 00:54:17,018
- Okay, you two.

1359
00:54:17,019 --> 00:54:19,120
Look up at the camera.

1360
00:54:19,121 --> 00:54:20,522
That's good.

1361
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:21,723
- It's an honest mistake, Carm.

1362
00:54:21,724 --> 00:54:22,724
He'll understand.

1363
00:54:22,725 --> 00:54:23,725
- Listen to me, man.

1364
00:54:23,726 --> 00:54:24,726
It's just a few lines.

1365
00:54:24,727 --> 00:54:25,727
I think I can fix it.

1366
00:54:25,728 --> 00:54:27,095
- Carm, it's their vows.

1367
00:54:27,096 --> 00:54:28,664
It's the most important part,
all right?

1368
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:30,365
I'm gonna tell him.
- All right, you do that,

1369
00:54:30,366 --> 00:54:31,767
You can kiss her sweet ass
good-bye.

1370
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,168
- All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

1371
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:34,336
at this point in time,

1372
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:35,804
we'd like to ask everyone
to please--

1373
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:37,005
- Let me just ask you this,
okay?

1374
00:54:37,006 --> 00:54:38,006
One question.

1375
00:54:38,007 --> 00:54:40,842
Have I ever, ever let you down?

1376
00:54:40,843 --> 00:54:42,010
- What are you talking about?

1377
00:54:42,011 --> 00:54:43,978
It's two days in a row with you.

1378
00:54:43,979 --> 00:54:46,715
- Yeah, but when it came time
to step it up,

1379
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:48,550
did I not step it up?

1380
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:51,553
- No, Carm, I know you're
just gonna make things worse.

1381
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:52,788
- How could it be
any worse, man?

1382
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,255
- We got five minutes
of play-by-play

1383
00:54:54,256 --> 00:54:55,657
Where the frickin' vows
should be.

1384
00:54:55,658 --> 00:54:57,258
[man laughs]

1385
00:54:57,259 --> 00:54:58,259
- Excuse me?

1386
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:00,195
- Nothin'.

1387
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:01,663
- No, no,
I thought I heard something.

1388
00:55:01,664 --> 00:55:02,664
I just wanted to know.

1389
00:55:02,665 --> 00:55:03,998
- I didn't say nothing, buddy.

1390
00:55:03,999 --> 00:55:05,099
- You didn't say nothin'?
'Cause I--

1391
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,468
[dishes clattering]

1392
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,036
- Don't talk to him like that.

1393
00:55:08,037 --> 00:55:09,237
- What are you,
his bodyguard?

1394
00:55:09,238 --> 00:55:10,639
- Hey, hey, hey.

1395
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,973
You don't talk to him like that.

1396
00:55:11,974 --> 00:55:14,042
- This is my kitchen,
so get the hell out of here.

1397
00:55:14,043 --> 00:55:15,243
- Oh, yeah, you own this place?

1398
00:55:15,244 --> 00:55:16,645
Huh, comrade?

1399
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:17,713
- Comrade?

1400
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:19,047
- Why don't you back
the fuck off

1401
00:55:19,048 --> 00:55:21,149
and let me have a conversation
with my brother, okay?

1402
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:22,751
You got a lot of shit here
to do, don't you?

1403
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:24,653
- You don't point the finger
at me.

1404
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,655
- I don't point the finger
at you?

1405
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,590
I'll point wherever
the fuck I want.

1406
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:29,591
- Carm, don't.

1407
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:30,925
- I point wherever
the fuck I want.

1408
00:55:30,926 --> 00:55:33,127
- You want some--
some Portuguese love?

1409
00:55:33,128 --> 00:55:34,463
- Yes.

1410
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:36,130
Right fuckin' here
and right fuckin' now.

1411
00:55:36,131 --> 00:55:37,833
Where's that Portuguese
fuckin' love?

1412
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:38,834
I'll kill you!

1413
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,134
- Come on!

1414
00:55:40,135 --> 00:55:41,169
I'll fucking kill him!

1415
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:42,571
- I'll point off
your fucking head!

1416
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:43,972
- Back off, back off.

1417
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:46,408
- I'll fuckin' whip
a dirty Sanchez on your ass.

1418
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:48,176
You want a dirty Sanchez,
you motherfucker?

1419
00:55:48,177 --> 00:55:49,210
- Oh!

1420
00:55:55,651 --> 00:55:59,320
- Ow.

1421
00:55:59,321 --> 00:56:00,655
Did you see?
He grabbed my finger.

1422
00:56:00,656 --> 00:56:02,023
He almost pricked my finger off.

1423
00:56:02,024 --> 00:56:03,492
- Look at me.
- Where the fuck were you?

1424
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:04,493
- Look at me.

1425
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:05,827
Look at me.

1426
00:56:05,828 --> 00:56:07,729
You're killing me
with the sound, with the girl.

1427
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:09,130
You're killing me here.

1428
00:56:09,131 --> 00:56:11,065
- No, no, no, you don't blame
this--the girl on me.

1429
00:56:11,066 --> 00:56:12,233
You don't blame the girl on me.

1430
00:56:12,234 --> 00:56:13,368
She's totally into you.

1431
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:14,503
- Will you stop with that?

1432
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:17,105
- No, no, no,
she came up to me before,

1433
00:56:17,106 --> 00:56:18,940
and she was asking
if you were single,

1434
00:56:18,941 --> 00:56:20,509
you were married, divorced.

1435
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:21,510
- Divorced?

1436
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:22,644
She thinks I'm divorced.

1437
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:23,779
- No, man, I told her

1438
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,213
you're playing the field,
you know?

1439
00:56:25,214 --> 00:56:26,715
- What?

1440
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:28,016
- No, like, in a good way,

1441
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:30,018
like you're getting a lot
of offers and shit.

1442
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:31,486
- Mind your business.

1443
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,654
- Oh, man.

1444
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:33,789
Just--just give me--

1445
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:36,691
just give me a few hours,
please, okay?

1446
00:56:36,692 --> 00:56:37,692
I can fix this.

1447
00:56:37,693 --> 00:56:39,027
I can do this.

1448
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:40,028
Please?

1449
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:41,029
I can do this.

1450
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:42,030
Please.

1451
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:43,665
- A few hours.
- Yes.

1452
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:45,166
Till, like, dinner.

1453
00:56:45,167 --> 00:56:47,268
- Till dinner?
- Yeah.

1454
00:56:47,269 --> 00:56:51,673
- Okay, and then you'll stop
whether it's fixed or not?

1455
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:54,175
- Promise.

1456
00:56:54,176 --> 00:56:56,044
You want me to sign
another cocktail napkin?

1457
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:57,612
I'll sign a cocktail napkin
for you.

1458
00:57:02,117 --> 00:57:03,652
- Where's the damn latch?

1459
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:04,753
- Hey.

1460
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:05,987
There they are, folks,

1461
00:57:05,988 --> 00:57:07,989
for the first time ever
as husband and wife.

1462
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:10,391
- Come on, guy,
what do you want now?

1463
00:57:10,392 --> 00:57:11,593
- It seems like yesterday

1464
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,528
You and Paul were running around
the backyard,

1465
00:57:13,529 --> 00:57:16,364
and now you're all grown up
with such a beautiful bride.

1466
00:57:16,365 --> 00:57:17,799
Congratulations.
- That's good.

1467
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,602
Take the microphone out, cut.

1468
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:21,603
Where the hell is he?

1469
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:22,838
What, he fall in?

1470
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:24,873
- Lou, he said something
about the shrimp cocktail.

1471
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:26,074
- I had the shrimp cocktail.

1472
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:27,676
There's nothing wrong
with the shrimp--

1473
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:29,811
We're gonna have to do what
they call a take two on this.

1474
00:57:29,812 --> 00:57:31,513
You've heard that term,
haven't you?

1475
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:32,581
- Oh, it's no big deal.

1476
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:36,485
It's just a little
postgame report,

1477
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:37,886
part of the standard package.

1478
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:38,887
I hope you don't mind.

1479
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:39,888
You don't mind, do you?

1480
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:41,255
- I do, actually.

1481
00:57:41,256 --> 00:57:42,757
- I'm sorry, you what?

1482
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:45,026
- I do.

1483
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:49,865
- Can you hold that
for a second?

1484
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,742
- Wait a minute, smooth.

1485
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:02,276
All right, wait, wait,
all right.

1486
00:58:02,277 --> 00:58:03,912
Cut, cut.

1487
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:06,147
How many times
do we have to do this thing?

1488
00:58:06,148 --> 00:58:07,716
- Sorry, Lou,
I don't have enough hands.

1489
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:10,351
- Yeah, well, now you know
why I hired two of you bozos.

1490
00:58:10,352 --> 00:58:11,352
- Pig in a blanket?

1491
00:58:11,353 --> 00:58:13,121
- Hey, Trixie, I'll take those.

1492
00:58:15,424 --> 00:58:19,160
- So what's with your brother?

1493
00:58:19,161 --> 00:58:20,294
- What?
What's going on?

1494
00:58:20,295 --> 00:58:22,063
- He just locked me
out of the bridal suite,

1495
00:58:22,064 --> 00:58:25,400
and I've got
all my gear in there.

1496
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:27,536
- Now, Pamela, Pam,

1497
00:58:27,537 --> 00:58:28,537
can I call you Pam?

1498
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:30,471
- Yeah, sure.

1499
00:58:30,472 --> 00:58:31,472
- You doing good?

1500
00:58:31,473 --> 00:58:32,473
You feeling all right?

1501
00:58:32,474 --> 00:58:34,242
- Yeah, this is kind of fun.

1502
00:58:34,243 --> 00:58:35,744
- I know.

1503
00:58:35,745 --> 00:58:36,745
You're doing really good.

1504
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:38,446
- You think so?

1505
00:58:38,447 --> 00:58:42,183
- You want to help us
record sound for a little bit?

1506
00:58:42,184 --> 00:58:43,585
Unless it would
get you in trouble.

1507
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:45,319
- Yeah, no, no, no,
it's cool.

1508
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,856
She's got a real big spot
for that maitre d'.

1509
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,791
- You're very attractive.

1510
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:51,993
You're like a wild cat.

1511
00:58:51,994 --> 00:58:53,562
I want to tame you.

1512
00:58:53,563 --> 00:58:55,129
- I'm untamable.

1513
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:56,898
- No, everybody's tamable.

1514
00:58:56,899 --> 00:58:59,100
- You gonna scratch me up
with that mustache?

1515
00:58:59,101 --> 00:59:00,368
- Ooh.

1516
00:59:00,369 --> 00:59:02,370
- Okay, all right.

1517
00:59:02,371 --> 00:59:03,905
Come on.

1518
00:59:03,906 --> 00:59:06,541
I want to get that ice sculpture
before it melts.

1519
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:08,142
- Roger that, Lou.

1520
00:59:08,143 --> 00:59:10,745
- At the end of the ceremony,

1521
00:59:10,746 --> 00:59:14,248
there was a moment there,
you got a little emotional,

1522
00:59:14,249 --> 00:59:16,250
you know, you got a little...

1523
00:59:16,251 --> 00:59:18,352
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1524
00:59:18,353 --> 00:59:19,721
Yeah.

1525
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:20,722
- I was cryin'.

1526
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,223
- Yeah.

1527
00:59:23,425 --> 00:59:29,564
What exactly was that moment
in the ceremony,

1528
00:59:29,565 --> 00:59:30,932
you know, the part where--

1529
00:59:30,933 --> 00:59:34,302
what was the specific line?

1530
00:59:34,303 --> 00:59:35,637
- The line?

1531
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:38,873
- Yeah, that really, you know,
moved you.

1532
00:59:38,874 --> 00:59:41,710
You put yourself in that place
right now for me?

1533
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:44,145
- Sure, okay.

1534
00:59:47,382 --> 00:59:52,153
I will cherish and honor you...

1535
00:59:54,156 --> 00:59:56,958
all the days of my life.

1536
00:59:58,828 --> 01:00:00,161
- Holy shit.

1537
01:00:00,162 --> 01:00:02,497
- I'm sorry, I'm crying.

1538
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:03,632
Joe.

1539
01:00:05,267 --> 01:00:06,267
- You better watch out.

1540
01:00:06,268 --> 01:00:07,268
I'm gonna marry her.

1541
01:00:07,269 --> 01:00:08,269
[laughter]

1542
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:09,270
- Sorry.

1543
01:00:09,271 --> 01:00:12,674
- No, I'm gonna marry you.

1544
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:14,475
- Ladies and gentlemen,
at this point in time,

1545
01:00:14,476 --> 01:00:15,876
we're gonna slow things down
a bit.

1546
01:00:15,877 --> 01:00:17,578
We'd like to invite
all the couples out here

1547
01:00:17,579 --> 01:00:19,514
onto the dance floor.

1548
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:23,150
- And now swing over this way.

1549
01:00:23,151 --> 01:00:24,218
Okay, now check the lights.

1550
01:00:24,219 --> 01:00:25,753
No shadows, watch the shadows,
good.

1551
01:00:25,754 --> 01:00:28,656
- We love you, Pamela!

1552
01:00:28,657 --> 01:00:29,824
- You get that?

1553
01:00:29,825 --> 01:00:30,825
- Yeah, I got it.

1554
01:00:30,826 --> 01:00:31,926
- Good, good, good.

1555
01:00:31,927 --> 01:00:33,661
- Hey, father, how you doing?

1556
01:00:33,662 --> 01:00:34,729
I was hoping to get, like,

1557
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:36,497
a little bit of interview
with you.

1558
01:00:36,498 --> 01:00:38,700
- Just do me a favor.

1559
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:40,901
It's just I'm not a big fan
of the spotlight.

1560
01:00:40,902 --> 01:00:42,804
- So I was thinking about
what you said last night

1561
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:44,472
about starting
your own business,

1562
01:00:44,473 --> 01:00:45,473
going out on your own.

1563
01:00:45,474 --> 01:00:47,274
- It's still a long way off.

1564
01:00:47,275 --> 01:00:50,745
- Well, maybe not, you know,
if you partner up with somebody,

1565
01:00:50,746 --> 01:00:52,680
split the overhead
and the startup costs.

1566
01:00:52,681 --> 01:00:54,081
- Perhaps just something,

1567
01:00:54,082 --> 01:00:56,283
a quick quote from something
you said on the altar maybe.

1568
01:00:56,284 --> 01:00:57,885
- Here, Lorraine,
you're the big talker.

1569
01:00:57,886 --> 01:00:58,986
You take the microphone.

1570
01:00:58,987 --> 01:01:00,521
- Hey, Joe,
I just want to tell you--

1571
01:01:00,522 --> 01:01:03,424
- Whoo, you're fuckin' awesome,
man!

1572
01:01:03,425 --> 01:01:05,926
- Get that--watch the wire.

1573
01:01:05,927 --> 01:01:08,195
- Listen, if it's money
you're worried about,

1574
01:01:08,196 --> 01:01:09,196
I can help out.

1575
01:01:09,197 --> 01:01:10,531
I have excellent credit.

1576
01:01:10,532 --> 01:01:12,867
- I appreciate the offer,
Anthony, really I do.

1577
01:01:12,868 --> 01:01:14,769
But to take a Gamble like that
at this point,

1578
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:16,103
it's just not possible.

1579
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:19,039
Three o'clock, Lou,
you got waterworks.

1580
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:20,908
- What?
- Three o'clock.

1581
01:01:22,911 --> 01:01:24,111
- Why not?

1582
01:01:24,112 --> 01:01:25,813
What, you have kids to support
or something?

1583
01:01:25,814 --> 01:01:27,114
- Hey, where's the bride?

1584
01:01:27,115 --> 01:01:29,751
- Right behind you, Lou.

1585
01:01:29,752 --> 01:01:32,687
[cheering and laughter]

1586
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:41,596
- <i>In nomine patris et filii</i>
<i>et spritus sancti.</i>

1587
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:42,597
Amen.

1588
01:01:42,598 --> 01:01:45,833
- So what do you think, man?

1589
01:01:45,834 --> 01:01:46,967
- It's not even close.

1590
01:01:46,968 --> 01:01:48,536
- Oh, come on, man,
give me a shot at that.

1591
01:01:48,537 --> 01:01:49,904
Let me try it again.

1592
01:01:49,905 --> 01:01:51,706
- No, we agreed until dinner,
and now that's it.

1593
01:01:51,707 --> 01:01:52,774
You guys are done.

1594
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:53,875
- What are you talking about?

1595
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,309
Listen, they just served
the salad.

1596
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:56,844
- Which happens to be
the first course.

1597
01:01:56,845 --> 01:01:58,679
- No, the clam chowder
is the first course.

1598
01:01:58,680 --> 01:01:59,881
Am I right, "T"?

1599
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,783
- Technically a salad's
considered an appetizer

1600
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:03,851
when followed by soup, pasta,
or risotto.

1601
01:02:03,852 --> 01:02:05,453
- Carm, Carm, I don't care.

1602
01:02:05,454 --> 01:02:06,987
You're finished, okay?

1603
01:02:06,988 --> 01:02:08,456
- You call yourself family?

1604
01:02:08,457 --> 01:02:09,924
- I'm--I'm gonna--

1605
01:02:09,925 --> 01:02:11,325
- Listen, come on,
don't get on him.

1606
01:02:11,326 --> 01:02:13,260
He's the only one
who's helping me out here.

1607
01:02:13,261 --> 01:02:15,496
He's a frickin' whiz
with this shit.

1608
01:02:15,497 --> 01:02:17,298
- Well, I took a couple
of community ed classes

1609
01:02:17,299 --> 01:02:18,299
Back at home.

1610
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:19,333
- Oh, you did?

1611
01:02:19,334 --> 01:02:20,635
You took a couple--
- Okay, okay.

1612
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:22,136
Into my office, big guy.

1613
01:02:24,039 --> 01:02:26,240
- Now, tell me exactly
what she said to you.

1614
01:02:26,241 --> 01:02:28,910
- No, I don't--
I don't want to talk about it.

1615
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:32,079
- I'm not lying to you, man,
all right?

1616
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,449
She told me--she asked me
all these things about you.

1617
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:36,651
Now, I don't know whether
she was just shooting the shit

1618
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:37,752
or she was interested

1619
01:02:37,753 --> 01:02:41,456
or she's got a cute sister
or what.

1620
01:02:41,457 --> 01:02:44,124
You know, I don't know.

1621
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:46,293
And--and that's the point, man.

1622
01:02:46,294 --> 01:02:50,164
Neither will you
if you don't just go out there

1623
01:02:50,165 --> 01:02:51,732
and fuckin' do something
about it, man.

1624
01:02:51,733 --> 01:02:54,001
- You want me to start
dubbing this in, chief?

1625
01:02:54,002 --> 01:02:56,070
- Yes, yes, do that, do that.

1626
01:02:58,373 --> 01:03:00,541
Hey.

1627
01:03:00,542 --> 01:03:04,879
I'm gonna put this in
my best man speech to you, man.

1628
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:09,684
This, you and me right here,
right now,

1629
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:11,452
when you walked in here
and you were all upset

1630
01:03:11,453 --> 01:03:13,053
and you wanted to
throw everything away.

1631
01:03:13,054 --> 01:03:14,555
You wanted to
give everything up,

1632
01:03:14,556 --> 01:03:17,191
and then you realized
that this chick,

1633
01:03:17,192 --> 01:03:20,294
she may be the best thing
that ever happened to you,

1634
01:03:20,295 --> 01:03:23,598
and if you didn't just say,
"fuck it"--

1635
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:25,933
and I promise I won't curse
in your speech--

1636
01:03:25,934 --> 01:03:28,736
and go out there
and do something about it,

1637
01:03:28,737 --> 01:03:31,305
you may regret this
for the rest of your life.

1638
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:37,277
Look at you.

1639
01:03:37,278 --> 01:03:40,280
You told me that you had
a connection with her, right?

1640
01:03:40,281 --> 01:03:42,049
You said that.

1641
01:03:43,418 --> 01:03:45,085
Crazier things have happened.

1642
01:03:45,086 --> 01:03:48,022
Unless, you know what?

1643
01:03:48,023 --> 01:03:49,189
I'll go out there.

1644
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:52,693
I'll tell "T"
let's forget everything.

1645
01:03:52,694 --> 01:03:55,095
And I'll go--I'll cover Lou.

1646
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:59,366
- No, no, no.

1647
01:03:59,367 --> 01:04:00,768
Just hurry up, all right?

1648
01:04:00,769 --> 01:04:02,102
- All right?

1649
01:04:02,103 --> 01:04:03,638
All right.

1650
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:05,472
Look at this face.

1651
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:09,877
Go get 'em, tiger.

1652
01:04:15,951 --> 01:04:17,451
He's dead in the water.

1653
01:04:17,452 --> 01:04:18,853
- Can I get the--

1654
01:04:18,854 --> 01:04:20,922
let me get that thing.

1655
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:24,759
Yeah, just give me--
yeah, give me the whole thing.

1656
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:25,760
- Whoops.

1657
01:04:25,761 --> 01:04:27,628
- Oh, no, oh, whoa.

1658
01:04:31,533 --> 01:04:33,367
- Jack, neat, please.

1659
01:04:33,368 --> 01:04:34,669
- Ladies and gentlemen,

1660
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:36,604
thanks for joining us
out here on the dance floor.

1661
01:04:36,605 --> 01:04:38,673
We'd like to ask everyone
to please find their seats.

1662
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:39,907
In just a few moments,

1663
01:04:39,908 --> 01:04:42,009
we're gonna get ready
for some Greek dancing.

1664
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:43,010
- Listen, Lou, I got to go.

1665
01:04:43,011 --> 01:04:44,511
I got to shoot this.
- Huh?

1666
01:04:44,512 --> 01:04:46,480
- I got to shoot this,
all right?

1667
01:04:46,481 --> 01:04:48,148
- Ah, that's grand, thanks.

1668
01:04:48,149 --> 01:04:49,650
Thanks very much.

1669
01:04:49,651 --> 01:04:51,619
Could I have another--

1670
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:53,387
- Hey, Father.

1671
01:04:53,388 --> 01:04:54,388
How you doing?

1672
01:04:54,389 --> 01:04:55,623
- Sorry, laddie.

1673
01:04:55,624 --> 01:04:57,792
I-I didn't mean
to get you in trouble before.

1674
01:04:57,793 --> 01:04:59,259
- Oh, roger that, Padre.

1675
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:01,629
It's actually
not even about that.

1676
01:05:01,630 --> 01:05:05,399
I'm having, like, sort of,
like, personal issues.

1677
01:05:06,668 --> 01:05:07,935
- All right,
give me a minute here.

1678
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:14,709
- Hey.

1679
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:17,778
Macaroni, get your lazy ass--

1680
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:24,852
- There's no more of this?

1681
01:05:24,853 --> 01:05:26,954
Is there any more in there?

1682
01:05:26,955 --> 01:05:28,623
It's all gone?

1683
01:05:28,624 --> 01:05:30,491
- After, after, after.

1684
01:05:30,492 --> 01:05:33,260
- You know, you told me
we were going to your office.

1685
01:05:33,261 --> 01:05:34,261
- Yeah, this is my office.

1686
01:05:34,262 --> 01:05:35,930
Ooh, the hair.

1687
01:05:35,931 --> 01:05:36,998
Easy with the hair.

1688
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:38,766
One thing, you know.

1689
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:44,105
- Hey.

1690
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:47,742
- Hey, where'd you run off to?

1691
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:49,010
- Had to powder my nose.

1692
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:50,711
- Oh, should have told Lou.

1693
01:05:50,712 --> 01:05:52,412
He's flippin' a lid out there.

1694
01:05:52,413 --> 01:05:55,816
- Yeah, I realize that,

1695
01:05:55,817 --> 01:05:57,918
But I wanted to talk to you,
so...

1696
01:05:57,919 --> 01:06:02,056
- Oh, uh, can we walk and talk?

1697
01:06:02,057 --> 01:06:03,057
- Yeah.

1698
01:06:03,058 --> 01:06:05,392
- Okay.

1699
01:06:08,196 --> 01:06:11,298
- And then the wife,
she's sick.

1700
01:06:11,299 --> 01:06:13,800
She's in the hospital,

1701
01:06:13,801 --> 01:06:15,202
hospital bills piling up.

1702
01:06:15,203 --> 01:06:21,509
I'm--I'm really strongly
considering the "D" word.

1703
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:23,677
- Son, you made a commitment,
did you not?

1704
01:06:23,678 --> 01:06:25,479
- Yeah, I know, I know.

1705
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:28,416
And I keep thinking back
to my wedding, you know?

1706
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:33,587
I keep on thinking back to
the vows that I took, you know?

1707
01:06:33,588 --> 01:06:35,122
- The vows, yes.
- Yeah.

1708
01:06:35,123 --> 01:06:37,824
- They can guide you
in times like this.

1709
01:06:40,195 --> 01:06:41,795
- Cheese and crackers.

1710
01:06:41,796 --> 01:06:43,797
- If only I can remember them,
I--

1711
01:06:43,798 --> 01:06:49,503
- Son, you made a promise to god
for better or for worse,

1712
01:06:49,504 --> 01:06:53,374
in sickness and in health,
for richer or for poorer.

1713
01:06:56,644 --> 01:06:59,280
- And then that's till...

1714
01:07:00,648 --> 01:07:02,950
- Till death do you part.

1715
01:07:04,419 --> 01:07:06,787
- Holy Jesus Christ.

1716
01:07:06,788 --> 01:07:08,556
Holy shit.

1717
01:07:08,557 --> 01:07:11,492
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.

1718
01:07:11,493 --> 01:07:13,294
- Anthony, I have to go shoot.

1719
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:15,229
- I know, I know, I know.

1720
01:07:15,230 --> 01:07:20,534
But answer me this one question,
one question, and be honest.

1721
01:07:20,535 --> 01:07:23,070
Last night...

1722
01:07:23,071 --> 01:07:26,607
Did you feel for one moment
that there was something?

1723
01:07:26,608 --> 01:07:28,942
- All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

1724
01:07:28,943 --> 01:07:30,177
at this point in time,

1725
01:07:30,178 --> 01:07:33,680
we need to get all
the single ladies out here.

1726
01:07:33,681 --> 01:07:36,150
- I got to go shoot this,
I'm sorry.

1727
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:41,489
- Great job, Hollywood.

1728
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:43,023
God, you're like
a secret agent.

1729
01:07:43,024 --> 01:07:45,058
- You got it, right?
- Yeah.

1730
01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:47,361
- Does this come off?

1731
01:07:47,362 --> 01:07:48,362
Let me see that chest.

1732
01:07:48,363 --> 01:07:50,931
- Oh, fuck.

1733
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:53,900
- All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

1734
01:07:53,901 --> 01:07:55,068
we're gonna kick it into gear.

1735
01:07:55,069 --> 01:07:57,671
I need everybody to put
their hands together.

1736
01:07:59,307 --> 01:08:01,108
- So this conversation is over?

1737
01:08:01,109 --> 01:08:02,109
- I got to get back to work.

1738
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:03,810
- Come on, please.

1739
01:08:03,811 --> 01:08:05,479
Please.

1740
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,481
- I will cherish--

1741
01:08:07,482 --> 01:08:10,083
- Better or for worse.
- And honor you.

1742
01:08:10,084 --> 01:08:11,952
- It's like a fuckin'
Kung Fu movie.

1743
01:08:11,953 --> 01:08:13,787
- Relax, Hollywood,
it's just a sync issue.

1744
01:08:13,788 --> 01:08:15,623
I'm just gonna slip around
a bit.

1745
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:16,890
- You say that one more time,

1746
01:08:16,891 --> 01:08:19,126
I'm gonna strangle you
with your hat.

1747
01:08:19,127 --> 01:08:20,661
- I'd rather you didn't.

1748
01:08:20,662 --> 01:08:21,995
It's part of the uniform.

1749
01:08:21,996 --> 01:08:24,931
[moaning]

1750
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:28,569
- Hey, Joe, Joe, have you seen
my new guys around here?

1751
01:08:28,570 --> 01:08:30,271
- Yeah, they're inside
bugging the priest.

1752
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:32,039
- The priest?
- Right in the bar.

1753
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,507
- The bar.
- Five minutes, guys.

1754
01:08:33,508 --> 01:08:34,542
Let's go, <i>Rapido.</i>

1755
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:35,543
- I'll beg.

1756
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:37,077
I'll beg right now.

1757
01:08:37,078 --> 01:08:38,512
- No, no.

1758
01:08:38,513 --> 01:08:39,746
Please get up.

1759
01:08:39,747 --> 01:08:42,883
[moaning]

1760
01:08:44,752 --> 01:08:45,752
- I do.

1761
01:08:45,753 --> 01:08:47,054
- Dance with me.
- No.

1762
01:08:47,055 --> 01:08:48,556
- Just once.

1763
01:08:48,557 --> 01:08:51,492
[moaning]

1764
01:08:57,131 --> 01:08:58,131
- Oops.

1765
01:08:58,132 --> 01:08:59,866
- What, what oops?
- Nothing.

1766
01:08:59,867 --> 01:09:00,967
- What are you talking about?

1767
01:09:00,968 --> 01:09:01,968
Something ooped here.

1768
01:09:01,969 --> 01:09:03,571
[thunder crashes]

1769
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:05,872
- Last I saw, he was running off
to the lavatory

1770
01:09:05,873 --> 01:09:07,908
like he was about to burst.

1771
01:09:10,445 --> 01:09:11,445
- You hit record?

1772
01:09:11,446 --> 01:09:12,713
- I thought it was
the audio dub.

1773
01:09:12,714 --> 01:09:15,549
- Oh, man, you erased
the original tape.

1774
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:17,184
- Macaroni!

1775
01:09:21,089 --> 01:09:22,155
- Anthony, you're amazing.

1776
01:09:22,156 --> 01:09:23,424
There's so many girls out here.

1777
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:24,625
They're single.

1778
01:09:24,626 --> 01:09:25,559
- Kiss me.

1779
01:09:28,496 --> 01:09:29,830
- Come on!
Yeah!

1780
01:09:29,831 --> 01:09:30,831
Come on!
Yeah!

1781
01:09:30,832 --> 01:09:32,466
Fuck yeah!

1782
01:09:34,469 --> 01:09:36,103
- I just--I can't,
I can't.

1783
01:09:39,807 --> 01:09:40,774
[moaning]

1784
01:09:41,843 --> 01:09:42,843
- What? What?

1785
01:09:42,844 --> 01:09:44,778
What's wrong?

1786
01:09:44,779 --> 01:09:46,847
[moaning]

1787
01:09:46,848 --> 01:09:48,115
- I'm engaged.

1788
01:09:51,286 --> 01:09:52,286
- What's up, Lou?

1789
01:09:52,287 --> 01:09:54,722
How you doing?

1790
01:09:54,723 --> 01:09:57,658
- [screaming]

1791
01:10:08,970 --> 01:10:10,271
- Wish you would've
helped me out

1792
01:10:10,272 --> 01:10:12,640
with that fuckin' Lou Burns.

1793
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:14,241
I was taking a lot
of body shots.

1794
01:10:14,242 --> 01:10:16,677
- Well, you brought it
on yourself.

1795
01:10:16,678 --> 01:10:17,778
- I think I broke my nose.

1796
01:10:17,779 --> 01:10:18,779
Is it swollen?

1797
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:20,581
Dude, dude!

1798
01:10:20,582 --> 01:10:22,383
Ant!

1799
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:25,786
Come on, man!

1800
01:10:25,787 --> 01:10:29,823
Anthony, don't be
like this, man.

1801
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:34,795
Screw Lou Burns, man.

1802
01:10:34,796 --> 01:10:36,897
Screw him.

1803
01:10:36,898 --> 01:10:40,634
Screw Luis.

1804
01:10:40,635 --> 01:10:42,503
I bet there's a ton
of video guys

1805
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:45,172
Dying to snatch us up.

1806
01:10:45,173 --> 01:10:47,374
Anthony.

1807
01:10:47,375 --> 01:10:48,475
Whoa, what are you doing, man?

1808
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:52,179
What are you doing?

1809
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:53,447
Hey!

1810
01:10:53,448 --> 01:10:55,248
Hey!

1811
01:10:55,249 --> 01:10:56,684
Ow!

1812
01:10:56,685 --> 01:11:00,721
Don't throw my frickin'
led zeppelin bootleg!

1813
01:11:00,722 --> 01:11:03,056
You're out of my will.
You understand me?

1814
01:11:04,626 --> 01:11:08,028
You're out of my will.

1815
01:11:08,029 --> 01:11:10,096
God!

1816
01:11:10,097 --> 01:11:11,231
Fuckin' shit!

1817
01:11:27,682 --> 01:11:31,618
Ant, this is yours, Ant.

1818
01:11:37,659 --> 01:11:42,496
[telephone rings]

1819
01:11:42,497 --> 01:11:46,733
You've reached Marconi Video.

1820
01:11:46,734 --> 01:11:50,170
Carmine is not here right now,
but Anthony is

1821
01:11:50,171 --> 01:11:51,771
and his big dick.

1822
01:11:51,772 --> 01:11:54,208
[cackling]

1823
01:11:54,209 --> 01:11:55,876
[electronic beep]

1824
01:11:55,877 --> 01:11:59,313
- Hey, Anthony, it's Lauren.

1825
01:11:59,314 --> 01:12:02,383
Last night,
I'm sorry for what happened.

1826
01:12:02,384 --> 01:12:05,219
It just went a little too far,
and the truth is,

1827
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:07,721
I'm getting married
in three weeks,

1828
01:12:07,722 --> 01:12:11,291
and I got really confused
when I met you,

1829
01:12:11,292 --> 01:12:12,292
'cause you're great.

1830
01:12:12,293 --> 01:12:14,694
But, um, I'm getting married.

1831
01:12:14,695 --> 01:12:18,232
So I'm really sorry, and--

1832
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:21,435
Oh, and, you know, by the way,
Carmine totally lied to you.

1833
01:12:21,436 --> 01:12:23,637
I-I never asked
if you were married.

1834
01:12:23,638 --> 01:12:25,639
I just wanted you to know that.

1835
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,441
Okay, bye.

1836
01:12:34,349 --> 01:12:37,084
[bell dings]

1837
01:12:39,454 --> 01:12:42,122
- Hey, how about a few words
to the bride and groom?

1838
01:12:42,123 --> 01:12:43,924
- Hey, come on.

1839
01:12:43,925 --> 01:12:45,259
- What's the matter?

1840
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:47,461
- All right,
I'm not in the mood.

1841
01:12:47,462 --> 01:12:50,164
- You and Ant have got 58 yards
of the pindot going to Shoreham.

1842
01:12:50,165 --> 01:12:53,767
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what do you mean "me and Ant"?

1843
01:12:53,768 --> 01:12:55,135
- Carpet's in his blood.

1844
01:12:57,172 --> 01:12:58,705
- You want to go out
with Anthony today,

1845
01:12:58,706 --> 01:13:00,006
go work with Anthony today?

1846
01:13:00,007 --> 01:13:01,908
- No way I'm working with
that guy, are you crazy?

1847
01:13:01,909 --> 01:13:03,810
After what he said?
- I'll give you 50 bucks here.

1848
01:13:03,811 --> 01:13:05,145
This is bullshit.

1849
01:13:05,146 --> 01:13:08,515
This is bullshit.

1850
01:13:08,516 --> 01:13:09,749
- It's okay.

1851
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:13,287
This is gonna be interesting.

1852
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:24,831
- I'm not putting up
with your shit today, Carmine.

1853
01:13:24,832 --> 01:13:27,767
- You're not putting up
with <i>my</i> shit today?

1854
01:13:33,374 --> 01:13:34,608
What, you want to go?

1855
01:13:34,609 --> 01:13:36,376
- You want to step
into my office?

1856
01:13:36,377 --> 01:13:40,880
- You want to go
a couple rounds?

1857
01:13:40,881 --> 01:13:41,881
- No biting.

1858
01:13:41,882 --> 01:13:44,818
[grunting]

1859
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:54,128
- Come here!

1860
01:13:54,129 --> 01:13:55,629
You like that, huh?

1861
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:56,630
You like that?

1862
01:13:56,631 --> 01:13:57,797
Ow!

1863
01:13:57,798 --> 01:14:00,734
[grunting]

1864
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:06,140
Oh, you fucking bastard!

1865
01:14:11,179 --> 01:14:12,179
- Oh, yeah?

1866
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:13,514
- Yeah.

1867
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,320
- Get off me.

1868
01:14:20,321 --> 01:14:21,321
- You get off of me, man.

1869
01:14:21,322 --> 01:14:23,023
- No, you get off of me.

1870
01:14:23,024 --> 01:14:24,424
- You're hurting my neck.

1871
01:14:24,425 --> 01:14:27,227
[laughter]

1872
01:14:27,228 --> 01:14:28,828
Your mother.

1873
01:14:28,829 --> 01:14:30,330
- Nice.

1874
01:14:30,331 --> 01:14:31,331
Good one.

1875
01:14:31,332 --> 01:14:32,566
[laughter]

1876
01:14:32,567 --> 01:14:33,567
- Your mother.

1877
01:14:33,568 --> 01:14:36,870
[laughter]

1878
01:14:36,871 --> 01:14:37,871
- All right.

1879
01:14:37,872 --> 01:14:38,872
- You're a schmuck.

1880
01:14:38,873 --> 01:14:40,140
- Okay, let go of me.

1881
01:14:40,141 --> 01:14:42,008
Ow.

1882
01:14:42,009 --> 01:14:43,443
Ow.

1883
01:14:48,949 --> 01:14:53,119
Dude, what the hell
are we doing here, man?

1884
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,121
What the hell are we doing
back here?

1885
01:14:55,122 --> 01:14:57,291
What are we doing here?

1886
01:14:57,292 --> 01:15:01,961
[laughs]

1887
01:15:01,962 --> 01:15:03,297
We're two smart guys, right?

1888
01:15:03,298 --> 01:15:04,864
I mean--

1889
01:15:04,865 --> 01:15:06,833
- Yeah, that's half true.

1890
01:15:06,834 --> 01:15:08,468
- We got to do--

1891
01:15:08,469 --> 01:15:10,136
We got to go out,

1892
01:15:10,137 --> 01:15:11,938
start our own video business,
you know?

1893
01:15:11,939 --> 01:15:13,674
Fuck this shit.

1894
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:14,675
- Yeah?

1895
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:16,042
- Do it like grandpa
did it, man.

1896
01:15:16,043 --> 01:15:17,777
Go out on our own.

1897
01:15:17,778 --> 01:15:20,447
- Well, after last night,
who's gonna hire us?

1898
01:15:22,116 --> 01:15:25,686
- I can think of somebody.

1899
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:34,261
- No.
- Yeah.

1900
01:15:34,262 --> 01:15:35,462
- No.

1901
01:15:35,463 --> 01:15:36,463
- Yeah.

1902
01:15:36,464 --> 01:15:37,464
- No.
- Yeah.

1903
01:15:37,465 --> 01:15:38,998
- No!
- Yeah!

1904
01:15:38,999 --> 01:15:42,168
- There she goes.

1905
01:15:42,169 --> 01:15:44,003
There she goes.

1906
01:15:44,004 --> 01:15:45,305
- Oh, boy, here they come.

1907
01:15:45,306 --> 01:15:47,173
- It's your day, sweetie,
it's your day.

1908
01:15:47,174 --> 01:15:48,174
- That's right.

1909
01:15:48,175 --> 01:15:49,743
- What is that, a Betamax?

1910
01:15:49,744 --> 01:15:51,612
- Hey, this was top of the line
in its day.

1911
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:52,946
- Yeah, looks good.

1912
01:15:52,947 --> 01:15:54,881
You got the sound
all worked out, Carmine?

1913
01:15:54,882 --> 01:15:55,882
- We got the sound.

1914
01:15:55,883 --> 01:15:57,317
- You can hear me?

1915
01:15:57,318 --> 01:15:58,518
- One more big smile right here.

1916
01:15:58,519 --> 01:15:59,519
Oh, that's gorgeous.

1917
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:00,520
- Blow a kiss for Stephen.

1918
01:16:00,521 --> 01:16:01,588
For Stephen.

1919
01:16:01,589 --> 01:16:02,989
- I'm not blowing a kiss
to Stephen.

1920
01:16:02,990 --> 01:16:04,224
- Can you blow a kiss?

1921
01:16:04,225 --> 01:16:05,359
Yes.

1922
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,026
- Oh, sweetie, lipstick.

1923
01:16:07,027 --> 01:16:08,295
- Lipstick, teeth.

1924
01:16:08,296 --> 01:16:11,665
- Yeah, she's got lipstick
all over her face.

1925
01:16:11,666 --> 01:16:13,133
Good catch.
- Yeah.

1926
01:16:14,935 --> 01:16:16,436
- You look great.

1927
01:16:16,437 --> 01:16:17,837
- Thank you.

1928
01:16:17,838 --> 01:16:19,038
It's a little much.

1929
01:16:19,039 --> 01:16:20,507
- No, it's great.

1930
01:16:20,508 --> 01:16:21,742
You're fine.
- Mm-hmm.

1931
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:23,277
- You're more than fine;
you're beautiful.

1932
01:16:23,278 --> 01:16:24,278
- Thank you.

1933
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:26,780
- I wouldn't mind shooting you.

1934
01:16:26,781 --> 01:16:28,315
- I wouldn't mind being shot.

1935
01:16:28,316 --> 01:16:30,850
- Really, you should--you should
sit for me some time.

1936
01:16:30,851 --> 01:16:33,920
I'm doing a whole series
of naked hairy men.

1937
01:16:36,056 --> 01:16:37,357
- Thanks for this.

1938
01:16:37,358 --> 01:16:38,592
- Yeah.

1939
01:16:38,593 --> 01:16:40,427
- You nervous?
- Yeah.

1940
01:16:40,428 --> 01:16:41,528
- That's okay.

1941
01:16:41,529 --> 01:16:42,562
- I'm terrified.

1942
01:16:42,563 --> 01:16:44,765
- You'll be fine.
- Yeah, I know.

1943
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:46,366
- Hi.
- Hi.

1944
01:16:46,367 --> 01:16:47,534
What's your name?

1945
01:16:47,535 --> 01:16:49,068
- Deedle Deedle Dee.

1946
01:16:49,069 --> 01:16:50,370
Deedle Deedle Dee.

1947
01:16:50,371 --> 01:16:52,205
Deedle Deedle Deedle.

1948
01:16:52,206 --> 01:16:53,740
- Would you stop
screwing around?

1949
01:16:53,741 --> 01:16:55,975
Please stop screwing around.

1950
01:16:55,976 --> 01:16:57,344
- Test.

1951
01:16:57,345 --> 01:16:59,479
Test, test.
- That's better.

1952
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:02,649
Stop walking back and forth
and move back a little further.

1953
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:04,184
- Testing, testing.

1954
01:17:04,185 --> 01:17:05,885
How's this now?
Can you hear me now?

1955
01:17:05,886 --> 01:17:09,456
- Uh, this is Anthony
the videographer.

1956
01:17:09,457 --> 01:17:10,691
- Yeah, hi.

1957
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:13,427
- That Anthony?

1958
01:17:13,428 --> 01:17:15,028
- Okay, Anthony,
this is the inas.

1959
01:17:15,029 --> 01:17:16,496
That's Tina.
- Hi.

1960
01:17:16,497 --> 01:17:18,598
- Gina, Nina.

1961
01:17:18,599 --> 01:17:20,367
And this is my sister Liz.

1962
01:17:20,368 --> 01:17:22,135
- Hi.

1963
01:17:22,136 --> 01:17:23,870
- Nice to meet you.

1964
01:17:24,939 --> 01:17:26,406
- She's single.
- Shut up.

1965
01:17:27,842 --> 01:17:29,710
- It's--this is officially
the business.

1966
01:17:29,711 --> 01:17:31,612
- Good, wonderful,
keep going back.

1967
01:17:31,613 --> 01:17:33,013
- Can you hear me now?

1968
01:17:33,014 --> 01:17:35,816
- I can--
yes, can you hear <i>me</i> now?

1969
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:37,350
- Yes.
- Shut up.

1970
01:17:37,351 --> 01:17:38,819
Move back.

1971
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:41,955
- Listen, cowboy, I think you're
being overly cautious here.

1972
01:17:41,956 --> 01:17:43,256
We've got this thing.

1973
01:17:43,257 --> 01:17:44,725
- How many times
I got to tell you, "T,"

1974
01:17:44,726 --> 01:17:46,527
there are no take twos
in this business, okay?

1975
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:47,528
You screw up, you die.

1976
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:49,195
That's it.

1977
01:17:49,196 --> 01:17:51,197
- Okay, that's fine.

1978
01:17:51,198 --> 01:17:53,967
I think they're about to get
things started on the inside.

1979
01:17:53,968 --> 01:17:55,502
- What?

1980
01:17:55,503 --> 01:17:56,503
- It starts.

1981
01:17:56,504 --> 01:17:57,504
- Oh, crap.

1982
01:17:57,505 --> 01:17:59,006
- My father was supportive

1983
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:02,075
and said as long as
we shoot him a commercial,

1984
01:18:02,076 --> 01:18:03,243
he'd buy us the cameras.

1985
01:18:03,244 --> 01:18:05,145
Please, I don't mind at all.

1986
01:18:05,146 --> 01:18:06,446
Thanks.

1987
01:18:06,447 --> 01:18:08,015
[knocks on window]

1988
01:18:14,556 --> 01:18:16,990
Hi, Carmine,
these are the Inas.

1989
01:18:18,092 --> 01:18:19,292
- Hi.

1990
01:18:19,293 --> 01:18:21,061
I heard there was a wedding
some time today.

1991
01:18:21,062 --> 01:18:23,363
- Mm.

1992
01:18:23,364 --> 01:18:24,932
I heard that too.

1993
01:18:24,933 --> 01:18:26,199
This is great stuff.

1994
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,936
Nice meeting you.

1995
01:18:28,937 --> 01:18:30,103
- We're T-minus five here,

1996
01:18:30,104 --> 01:18:31,772
I got to pull you out
of an orgy?

1997
01:18:31,773 --> 01:18:32,773
- Carm, give me a break.

1998
01:18:32,774 --> 01:18:34,174
I was booking work in there.

1999
01:18:34,175 --> 01:18:35,408
- Seriously?

2000
01:18:35,409 --> 01:18:37,210
- Yeah, half these chicks
are getting married

2001
01:18:37,211 --> 01:18:38,244
in the next few months,

2002
01:18:38,245 --> 01:18:39,913
and you know
who they want to hire?

2003
01:18:39,914 --> 01:18:42,348
- You get a quote?

2004
01:18:42,349 --> 01:18:43,717
- Hi.

2005
01:18:43,718 --> 01:18:45,351
Don't forget you owe me a dance.

2006
01:18:45,352 --> 01:18:46,352
- I won't.
- Okay.

2007
01:18:46,353 --> 01:18:49,022
- Come on now.
- Very good.

2008
01:18:49,023 --> 01:18:50,256
- Boys, come on, come on.

2009
01:18:50,257 --> 01:18:51,992
They're starting, man.
Let's go.

2010
01:18:51,993 --> 01:18:53,259
- Oh, shit, shit, shit.

2011
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:54,260
Come on, come on.

2012
01:18:54,261 --> 01:18:55,528
You know what I'm thinking?

2013
01:18:55,529 --> 01:18:56,663
Screw these churches.

2014
01:18:56,664 --> 01:18:57,764
Let's hit up the synagogues,

2015
01:18:57,765 --> 01:18:59,432
get some of that
Bar Mitzvah action going.

2016
01:18:59,433 --> 01:19:00,734
- Bar Mitzvahs,
are you serious?

2017
01:19:00,735 --> 01:19:02,235
- Yeah, "T" was telling me

2018
01:19:02,236 --> 01:19:04,437
They're throwing 50, 60 grand
a pop down on these things.

2019
01:19:04,438 --> 01:19:05,739
- That's crazy.

2020
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:07,540
It's like a birthday party
for a 13-year-old.

2021
01:19:07,541 --> 01:19:08,541
- I know, it's ridiculous.

2022
01:19:08,542 --> 01:19:10,811
I got to get a pair of stilts.

2023
01:19:10,812 --> 01:19:12,145
- Are we on?

2024
01:19:12,146 --> 01:19:14,781
[clucking]

2025
01:19:14,782 --> 01:19:15,782
You're all about flipper.

2026
01:19:15,783 --> 01:19:16,883
[dolphin sounds]

2027
01:19:16,884 --> 01:19:19,486
- Hello?

2028
01:19:19,487 --> 01:19:20,587
Hello?

2029
01:19:20,588 --> 01:19:21,955
You guys are married.

2030
01:19:21,956 --> 01:19:23,122
Can you see me?

2031
01:19:23,123 --> 01:19:24,725
- Two words of advice for Chris.

2032
01:19:24,726 --> 01:19:27,427
Two famous words to say to get
everything right in a marriage:

2033
01:19:27,428 --> 01:19:28,428
Yes, dear.

2034
01:19:28,429 --> 01:19:29,663
- I just wanted to thank you

2035
01:19:29,664 --> 01:19:31,465
for letting me be
a part of your wedding,

2036
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:34,735
and I had a great time,
and I love both you guys.

2037
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:37,036
I wish you nothing
but the best of luck.

2038
01:19:37,037 --> 01:19:40,741
- There are three things
I'm very proud of you, Chris.

2039
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:42,609
One, that you didn't become
a fag fireman.

2040
01:19:42,610 --> 01:19:44,077
You've become a real cop,

2041
01:19:44,078 --> 01:19:46,680
a man's man, a cop's cop,
and a woman's delight.

2042
01:19:46,681 --> 01:19:48,314
- # ba bada ba
ba ba ba #

2043
01:19:48,315 --> 01:19:49,783
# ba bada ba
ba ba #

2044
01:19:49,784 --> 01:19:51,351
# ba bada ba
ba ba ba #

2045
01:19:51,352 --> 01:19:52,719
# ba bada ba
ba ba #

2046
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:55,655
B-A-U-S-E-I-S-D-E-R!

2047
01:19:55,656 --> 01:19:56,857
Bauser!

2048
01:19:56,858 --> 01:19:58,057
To bauser, you kid.

2049
01:19:58,058 --> 01:19:59,760
- Listen, man, big day for you.

2050
01:19:59,761 --> 01:20:00,927
Big, big, big day.

2051
01:20:00,928 --> 01:20:02,396
So proud of you.

2052
01:20:02,397 --> 01:20:03,697
Wonderful event.

2053
01:20:03,698 --> 01:20:05,866
Everything from the jumbo shrimp
down to the Heineken.

2054
01:20:05,867 --> 01:20:07,667
You didn't miss a beep.

2055
01:20:23,384 --> 01:20:24,718
- This is Joey.

2056
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:25,985
Watch out for this guy.

2057
01:20:25,986 --> 01:20:27,654
You guys got this
happy thing going on.

2058
01:20:27,655 --> 01:20:28,655
Don't be like him.

2059
01:20:28,656 --> 01:20:29,656
Not that he's a bad guy.

2060
01:20:29,657 --> 01:20:31,324
He's a marvelous guy.

2061
01:20:31,325 --> 01:20:32,392
It is a legend.

2062
01:20:32,393 --> 01:20:33,727
And you guys are gonna be
a legend.

2063
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:36,229
Why?
'Cause we love them.

2064
01:20:36,230 --> 01:20:37,731
Whoo-hoo!

2065
01:20:37,732 --> 01:20:38,732
- Right here my friend Sal.

2066
01:20:38,733 --> 01:20:40,801
Sal, come on over here.

2067
01:20:40,802 --> 01:20:42,068
I-I love this man.

2068
01:20:42,069 --> 01:20:44,103
The man's got mozzarella
coming out of his ears.

2069
01:20:44,104 --> 01:20:46,205
- I just want to say
I had a great time tonight,

2070
01:20:46,206 --> 01:20:49,008
even though my hair
is in absolute disarray.

2071
01:20:49,009 --> 01:20:50,376
It's not gonna bother me,
though.

2072
01:20:50,377 --> 01:20:52,712
You guys have--
you guys are the best.

2073
01:20:52,713 --> 01:20:54,548
And I wish you nothing
but the best.

2074
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:55,549
- Congratulations.

2075
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:56,650
I wish you the best of luck.

2076
01:20:56,651 --> 01:20:58,384
All the happiness in the world.

2077
01:20:58,385 --> 01:21:02,021
Weren't they great
at the wedding?

2078
01:21:02,022 --> 01:21:03,256
Yes, they were awesome.

2079
01:21:03,257 --> 01:21:04,257
Okay.

2080
01:21:04,258 --> 01:21:05,826
- # one act of kindness #

2081
01:21:05,827 --> 01:21:09,463
# that's the beauty of friends #

2082
01:21:09,464 --> 01:21:11,498
# through time #

2083
01:21:11,499 --> 01:21:15,569
# and our sentiment #

2084
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:20,306
# the doors to lasting
special light, my friend #

2085
01:21:20,307 --> 01:21:21,608
# light #

2086
01:21:21,609 --> 01:21:22,642
- A toast to bau.

2087
01:21:22,643 --> 01:21:24,544
Roses are red,
violets are bluish.

2088
01:21:24,545 --> 01:21:27,481
If it wasn't for Jesus,
we'd all be Jewish.

2089
01:21:27,482 --> 01:21:29,082
- I'd like to say
you're a cute couple.

2090
01:21:29,083 --> 01:21:32,519
But I can't, because you're
so goddamn ugly, Chris.

2091
01:21:34,254 --> 01:21:35,254
- You know what?

2092
01:21:35,255 --> 01:21:36,255
Don't even.

2093
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:37,256
Put it down.

2094
01:21:37,257 --> 01:21:38,825
- Don't even.

2095
01:21:38,826 --> 01:21:42,362
- Uh, I think you guys
are gonna do well,

2096
01:21:42,363 --> 01:21:44,030
And god bless yous.

2097
01:21:44,031 --> 01:21:46,533
Have plenty of kids.

2098
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:49,536
Keep the cash flowin',
because you're gonna need it,

2099
01:21:49,537 --> 01:21:52,372
and, uh...

2100
01:21:54,408 --> 01:21:59,045
Hey, happy times
and happy trails, you know.

2101
01:21:59,046 --> 01:22:01,715
I'll see you around,
'cause I'm your brother.

2102
01:22:01,716 --> 01:22:02,682
Hey, hey.
