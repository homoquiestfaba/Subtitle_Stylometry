1
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,350
Have a seat

2
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,060
You ok?

3
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,060
Yeah.

4
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,850
I need the other half  now.

5
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,270
Ok.

6
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,350
You ready, honey?

7
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,350
- Can I go with her?
- No I'm sorry.

8
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,310
I'll be right back to take you in.

9
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,210
You sure you're ok?

10
00:02:28,432 --> 00:02:32,132
PINK MOON

11
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,680
- What?
- This stuffed owl is watching us.

12
00:02:54,410 --> 00:03:00,150
Pleased to see you
Mr. Owl. Get it out.

13
00:03:00,174 --> 00:03:02,374
I used to spend hours
 between open trees

14
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:08,000
In my uncle's maple syrup farm in
Maine we've spent the summer there.

15
00:03:08,014 --> 00:03:12,043
We call it sugarbush.
- Sugarbush...

16
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:14,169
My cousin and I need to get up
 in the middle of the night to

17
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,989
Tap the trees.
- Why at night?

18
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:19,013
They say it grows faster

19
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,220
If there's a full moon.

20
00:03:22,004 --> 00:03:23,704
Do they ??? in the farm?

21
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,340
Yeah stop when my uncle died.

22
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,230
I'm gonna come
back there someday.

23
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,730
Start it up again.

24
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,289
Work all night.

25
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:44,179
You're crazy.

26
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,560
Oh shit!

27
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,550
- I'm home and I brought dinner.
- I'll be right down.

28
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,660
You've got a letter from overland.

29
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:40,700
The bug I picked last night and left
at my nightstand turn to dust when I

30
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,830
Touched it in the morning and I thought
to myself  is that what happens to us

31
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,030
When we die?

32
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:51,489
This is a key tenets of Buddhism
 nothing is permanent.

33
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,500
Thank you Steven for once again
simultaneously enlightning

34
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,039
And grossing us all out.

35
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,340
Ben you're the next.

36
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,450
I don't have anything.

37
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,530
Sarah how about you?

38
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,030
Fertility cults provided the
basis for early christianity.

39
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,429
Maybe you picked a religion?

40
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,340
Taoism.

41
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,340
I want something on
my desk by Friday.

42
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,090
Mr. Reed?

43
00:05:40,786 --> 00:05:45,386
 I was wondering ... I heard...

44
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,689
That you  might know someone that
could help me take care of something.

45
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:51,833
Like a doctor...?

46
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:55,489
Kind of a doctor.

47
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,889
You know what it's... it's
nothing I'll see you tomorrow.

48
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,340
Ben, wait.

49
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,840
No one should be out of reach.

50
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,560
See you babe.
See you.

51
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,560
Hey.

52
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,008
Did you see Steve's face when
 I scored the layup by him?

53
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:47,690
- Yeah it was alright. 'Oh no dude.'
- How was it like?

54
00:06:47,714 --> 00:06:50,414
No dude!

55
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:15,169
Fucking I want to be with you just
 here. Right now really quiet with ???

56
00:07:15,404 --> 00:07:17,279
No I can't...

57
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,303
Come on.

58
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:24,731
I'm sorry.

59
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,510
Four months Ben...

60
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,700
That's what normal people do.
- I'm sorry.

61
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,740
Stop saying that.

62
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,920
What is this?
- It's mine.

63
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:01,110
Who's number is this?
- It's a number for a Taoist expert.

64
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,569
 Mr. Reed gave me
 for my assignment.

65
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:10,740
Why are you being so weird?
 - It's just because I don't-

66
00:08:16,211 --> 00:08:18,911
Give me the phone!
Hi this is Ben.

67
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,940
Yeah from Mr. Reed.

68
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,208
Who knows?

69
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,298
What? How?

70
00:08:36,322 --> 00:08:39,122
He found the number Mr. Reed gave
 me and I told it was from a expert

71
00:08:39,198 --> 00:08:42,948
For my assignment but I'm such a shit liar
 and he started piecing things together.

72
00:08:42,948 --> 00:08:43,399
What happened?

73
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:46,670
He called the number and pretend to be me
and the woman thought it was suspicious

74
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,618
And hung up but I couldn't
lie to him anymore

75
00:08:48,619 --> 00:08:49,929
I couldn't think of anything.

76
00:08:49,953 --> 00:08:54,253
What are you gonna do?
- I don't know we stick to the plan.

77
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:12,030
Hey Purcellski.

78
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,000
- Want a lift?
- No thanks.

79
00:09:20,286 --> 00:09:23,066
We just wanna talk Ben.

80
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,870
Fucking breeder!

81
00:09:45,154 --> 00:09:47,674
What the fuck you're doing?
- That's your chance dude.

82
00:09:47,914 --> 00:09:50,114
Get off him!

83
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:55,333
Ben...

84
00:09:56,177 --> 00:09:58,477
Come on Leo, let's go.

85
00:10:09,923 --> 00:10:13,223
<i>Taoism</i>

86
00:10:54,369 --> 00:10:56,999
What's happening?

87
00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:00,179
It's alright.

88
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,749
Knees further apart.

89
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:14,153
You'll feel a little pressure.

90
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,200
What's happening?

91
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,000
Tell me what's happening?

92
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,310
Her cervix is torn and the uterus was
puncture but we think she'll be fine,

93
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,290
As long as we can keep
 the fever down.

94
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,590
I don't understand.
How did this happened?

95
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:07,380
Emily I'm dr. Collison and
 the chief of obstetrics.

96
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,879
How are you feeling?

97
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:11,803
Tired.

98
00:12:11,927 --> 00:12:14,727
Do you think you can answer
some questions for me?

99
00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:19,886
Do you know who dropped
 you off here tonight?

100
00:12:22,536 --> 00:12:25,536
Do you know who did this to you?

101
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:32,004
Emily I'm required by law to report
whether or not you cooperated.

102
00:12:33,446 --> 00:12:36,146
I don't know.

103
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:48,049
As you know termination is not an option
 so we really don't have a choice.

104
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:51,279
We'll handle the paperwork
 tomorrow.

105
00:13:00,805 --> 00:13:03,005
They want to keep you overnight.

106
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,380
You'll have to sign some
 papers in the morning.

107
00:13:05,404 --> 00:13:07,179
What papers?

108
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,190
Adoption consent forms.

109
00:13:11,214 --> 00:13:13,389
I'm not doing-
You don't have a choice Emily.

110
00:13:14,672 --> 00:13:16,672
What about college?

111
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,210
What about Ben?
Ben?

112
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:23,917
Ben Purcellski?

113
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,510
You are not going to raise
 this baby with a boy.

114
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:32,359
There are thousands of normal couples
out there waiting to start a family

115
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,550
You can't just-

116
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:43,060
I shouldn't have brought
 this up now.

117
00:13:44,561 --> 00:13:48,561
You know when you
were a little girl,

118
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:54,870
You used to always ask your mother and me
 which one of us was your biological mom.

119
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,600
You were relentless.

120
00:13:57,624 --> 00:14:00,224
I still don't know.

121
00:14:01,778 --> 00:14:04,378
How it make a difference?

122
00:14:18,806 --> 00:14:22,766
Ohio is reeling from another teen
suicide at a local middle school.

123
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:26,570
Thirteen years old Lucas de Lauriol
reportedly shot himself with a handgun

124
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:30,930
That belonged to his father. This is the
second suicide in the small suburban town,

125
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,279
In three months.

126
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,860
Sources say both teens have been targets of
harassment after coming out as heterosexual.

127
00:14:54,888 --> 00:14:59,138
<i>International presidents, and fellow
leaders say the global population</i>

128
00:14:59,162 --> 00:15:01,162
<i>Growth summit in Zurich next.</i>

129
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,020
<i>She plans to push new measures to
maintain world population levels,</i>

130
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,930
<i>But some were skeptical an agreement can be
reached after tensions between the US in India.</i>

131
00:15:14,766 --> 00:15:16,466
Hey.

132
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,830
What are you doing?
I'm so sorry I left you.

133
00:15:22,854 --> 00:15:25,054
They were asking me all
 these questions I  just,

134
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,330
You're okay?

135
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,710
Yeah.

136
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,710
What about...?
They want me to give it up.

137
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,170
So you want...?

138
00:15:44,873 --> 00:15:47,173
I don't know.

139
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,310
I want to live on a
farm of Maple syrup.

140
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,190
Shit!

141
00:16:49,483 --> 00:16:52,183
PINK MOON
