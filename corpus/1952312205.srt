1
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,605
So you want to talk about it?

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,608
Oh yeah.

3
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:13,612
It all started in 1977.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,841
I mean,

5
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:19,943
that's when I started
doing it regularly.

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,716
How many times
have you done it?

7
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:25,121
Six times.

8
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:29,219
I've done it six times.

9
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:33,096
Why do you do it?

10
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:36,693
I don't know.

11
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,297
It's like I can't help myself.

12
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:43,810
What does your family think?

13
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,369
Thank God my
family doesn't know.

14
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:50,905
But how'd you get caught?

15
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,350
They were taping me.

16
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,217
Taping you?

17
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:58,152
Yeah.

18
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,022
Every time I did it,

19
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,222
they had a tape running.

20
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,423
Jumbo shrimp,

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,025
those words don't
even go together, man.

22
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:10,660
That's like
military intelligence,

23
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,466
they have that, too.

24
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,030
How did they do that?

25
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,200
That's what they tell you,

26
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:17,573
get on the plane,

27
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:18,736
get on the plane.

28
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:23,010
Fuck you,
I'm getting in the plane.

29
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:23,879
I wonder a lot of things,

30
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,315
but that's my job.

31
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:29,219
My job is
thinking up goofy shit.

32
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,757
Al Sleet here, your
hippie dippie weather man

33
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:35,784
with all the hippie
dippie weather, man.

34
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:40,231
Got into an argument
with my Rice Krispies.

35
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,426
I distinctly heard

36
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:46,302
Snap, Crackle, fuck him.

37
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,637
Have a nice day.

38
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,335
And the original list was
shit, piss, fuck, cunt,

39
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,900
cocksucker,
mother fucker and tits.

40
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:53,536
This was all I could
think of in one sitting.

41
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,443
That's all your house is,

42
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:55,811
is a place to keep your stuff

43
00:01:55,882 --> 00:02:00,285
while you go out
and get more stuff.

44
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:01,081
But here's a little cheer,

45
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:01,882
a lot of people like it,

46
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,013
it goes like this,

47
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,021
rat shit, bat shit,

48
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,057
dirty old twat.

49
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,116
69 assholes tied in a knot.

50
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:09,128
Hurrah, lizard shit.

51
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,289
Fuck.

52
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:12,763
I never fucked a 10,

53
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:16,428
but one night
I fucked five 2s.

54
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,528
Does it strike
you as mildly ironic

55
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,573
that most of the people
who are against abortion

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,734
are people you wouldn't want
to fuck in the first place?

57
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,404
And now they're thinking
about banning toy guns,

58
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,210
and they're going to
keep the fucking real ones.

59
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:18,689
Thank you,

60
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,255
thank you very much.

61
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,231
Welcome to our show.

62
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,599
Don't you think it's
just a little bit strange

63
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,764
that Ronald Reagan had
an operation on his asshole

64
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,467
and George Bush
had an operation

65
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,636
on his middle finger, huh?

66
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,702
Huh?

67
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:40,880
What are these two
men trying to tell us?

68
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,583
Now I'd like
to begin tonight

69
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:45,818
with an opening announcement.

70
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,053
Because of the FCC,

71
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:49,459
I'm never sure what it is

72
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,759
I'm allowed to say,

73
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,026
So.

74
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,697
So I now have my
own official policy.

75
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:04,540
This is the language you
will not be hearing tonight.

76
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,148
You will not hear me say,

77
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:11,308
bottom line,

78
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,510
game plan,

79
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,553
role model,

80
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,780
scenario,

81
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:17,721
or hopefully.

82
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,792
I will not kick back,

83
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,162
mellow out,

84
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:30,498
or be on a roll.

85
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,265
I will not go for it,

86
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:35,069
and I will not check it out.

87
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:39,237
I don't even
know what it is.

88
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:40,506
And when I leave here,

89
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:45,608
I definitely will not boogie.

90
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:49,382
I promise not to refer
to anyone as a class act,

91
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,946
a beautiful person,

92
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,551
or a happy camper.

93
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:02,728
I will also not be
saying, what a guy.

94
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,761
And you will not hear me
refer to anyone's lifestyle.

95
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,809
If you want to know what a
moronic word "lifestyle" is,

96
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,571
all you have to do is realize

97
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,203
that in a technical sense,

98
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,576
Attila the Hun

99
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:18,778
had an active,
outdoor lifestyle.

100
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:22,185
I will also not be
saying any cute things,

101
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:25,747
like moi,

102
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,953
and I will not use
the French adverb très

103
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,691
to modify any
English adjectives,

104
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,255
such as très awesome,

105
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,096
très narly, très fabut,

106
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,226
très intense,

107
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:39,237
or très out of sight.

108
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,533
I will not say concept

109
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,768
when I mean idea.

110
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,503
I will not say impacted

111
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,602
when I mean effected.

112
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,204
There will be no hands on

113
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:52,274
state of the art networking.

114
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,785
We will not maximize,

115
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,378
prioritize or finalize,

116
00:05:56,456 --> 00:06:01,758
and we definitely
will not interface.

117
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,619
There will also...

118
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,127
There will also be

119
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,398
no new age lingo

120
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,200
spoken here tonight,

121
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:15,833
no support group jargon

122
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:20,005
from the human
potential movement.

123
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,106
For instance, I will not

124
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:27,176
share anything with you.

125
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,256
I will not relate to you,

126
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:39,492
and you will not
identify with me.

127
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,363
I will give you no input,

128
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:44,801
and I will expect
no feedback.

129
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,305
This will not be a
learning experience,

130
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:50,865
nor will it be
a growth period.

131
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,138
There'll be no sharing,

132
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,179
no caring,

133
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,144
no birthing,

134
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:55,272
no bonding,

135
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,315
no parenting,

136
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,247
no nurturing.

137
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:00,047
We will not establish
a relationship,

138
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,611
we will not have
any meaningful dialogue,

139
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,919
and we definitely will not

140
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:08,290
spend any quality time.

141
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,797
We will not be
supportive of one another

142
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,603
so that we can get
in touch with our feelings

143
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:25,906
in order to feel
good about ourselves.

144
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,241
And if you're one
of those people

145
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,474
who needs a little space,

146
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:33,645
please, go the fuck outside!

147
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:45,964
We will,

148
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,863
we will, however,

149
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:51,165
be talking about
those little moments

150
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:56,072
that seem to last forever.

151
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,609
Have you ever been

152
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,339
in a serious social situation

153
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:01,971
when you suddenly realize

154
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,538
you have to pull the underwear

155
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,447
out of the crack in your ass?

156
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:16,887
Do you take this woman

157
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,363
to be your lawful wedded wife?

158
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,865
Huh?

159
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:29,966
Who, her?

160
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:33,979
Oh, hell yeah.

161
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,914
Well, it's one of life's
little moments, isn't it?

162
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,280
It's one of those
little moments

163
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,218
you have to deal
with at the time.

164
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,812
You can't postpone that.

165
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,118
You can't put that off

166
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,854
and be walking
around like this.

167
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:49,917
You've got to get in there

168
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:53,193
and clear that thing out.

169
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,827
You've got to
rescue your underwear.

170
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,371
There's a letter
in your mailbox.

171
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,640
That's right.

172
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:15,184
And you have to rectify

173
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,951
that situation

174
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,549
so that you can move along

175
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:23,528
to your next
embarrassing moment,

176
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:27,032
which is probably
scheduled immediately.

177
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,192
That's the way life is,

178
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:29,462
full of those little moments.

179
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:30,559
Everybody knows them,

180
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,502
everybody recognizes them.

181
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,233
You ever been at
a really loud party,

182
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,638
I mean, a good loud party

183
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,573
where the music
is playing too loud

184
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,976
and everybody is
talking too loudly,

185
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,445
and in order to be heard

186
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,675
even by the person
standing right next to you,

187
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,117
you've got to be screaming
at the top of your lungs.

188
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:49,211
But every now
and then at a party,

189
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:53,521
it seems as though everyone
shuts up at the same time.

190
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,357
And only your voice,

191
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,329
can be heard.

192
00:09:58,398 --> 00:09:59,888
Right, I know.

193
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,058
I know.

194
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,624
Well, what I'm going to do,

195
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:06,138
I'm going to have
my testicles laminated.

196
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:19,645
Life's little moments.

197
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:20,811
You ever been
talking to someone

198
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:21,854
and you laugh
through your nose

199
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,151
and blow a snot
on your shirt.

200
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,160
And you have to just
kind of keep talking,

201
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,291
you know,

202
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:40,305
and make believe
it's part of the design.

203
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:44,173
Works all right if you're
wearing a Hawaiian shirt,

204
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:47,076
but otherwise
they're going to notice.

205
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:52,482
Ed, you got a big
snot on your shirt.

206
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:59,222
Some guys are
really cruel, you know.

207
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,316
And some of these things

208
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,327
are not even your fault.

209
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:03,692
These little
things that happen,

210
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,128
you didn't cause
the situation,

211
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:06,790
a lot of time
you're the victim.

212
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,834
You walk into
some situation,

213
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:11,233
and suddenly you're the one
who's taking all the heat.

214
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:12,862
Not your fault.

215
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:14,702
Give you an example of
the kind of thing I mean.

216
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,401
Did you ever meet somebody

217
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:19,377
and you go to
shake the guy's hand

218
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,640
and you suddenly realize

219
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:26,981
he doesn't have
a complete hand?

220
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:30,819
And you got to make
believe it feels great,

221
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,348
Right, you can't go ahhhhhhhh,

222
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,657
ahhhhhhhh!

223
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:40,062
Ahhhhh!

224
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,431
You can't do that.

225
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:47,963
It's not even an option.

226
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,238
You got to hang
in there and say hi,

227
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,404
hey, swell hand.

228
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,142
Give me three.

229
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,080
Hi 3, yo!

230
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,023
Not your fault.

231
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,999
You didn't cause that.

232
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,057
You weren't even there

233
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,069
when it happened to the guy.

234
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:23,366
You were probably
out walking your dog,

235
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:26,606
which is what
I'm usually doing,

236
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,909
walking my dog.

237
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,778
Because I love my dog.

238
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,317
I love all my dogs.

239
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,353
I love every dog I ever had.

240
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,910
I remember them all,

241
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,182
and I love every one of them,

242
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,245
still love all my dogs.

243
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,918
And I've had me a
lot of God damn dogs.

244
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:42,460
In my lifetime I have had me

245
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,428
a bunch of different dogs.

246
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,931
Because you do keep getting
a new dog, don't you?

247
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,934
You just keep getting
one dog after another.

248
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,664
That's the whole
secret of life.

249
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:57,641
Life is a series of dogs.

250
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,110
It's true, you just keep
getting a new dog, don't you?

251
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,111
That's what's good about them,

252
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,206
they don't live too long.

253
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,275
And you can go get
a new God damn dog.

254
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,718
Sometimes you can get a dog

255
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:12,315
looks exactly like the dog
you used to have, right?

256
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,449
You shop around a little bit,

257
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:16,518
you can find a dog
identical to your former dog.

258
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:17,290
And that's real handy

259
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,523
because you don't
have to change

260
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:22,056
the pictures on your
mirror or anything,

261
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,159
right?

262
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,067
You just bring the dead
one into the pet shop,

263
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,400
throw him up
on the counter,

264
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,737
say give me
another one of them.

265
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,676
That was real good.

266
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,178
And they'll give
you a carbon copy

267
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:37,478
of your ex-God damn dog.

268
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,983
Now, my favorite dog

269
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:42,714
that I ever had in my
whole lifetime was Tippie.

270
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,517
Tippie was a good dog.

271
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,420
Some of you remember,

272
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,719
I've talked about Tippie.

273
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,316
Tippie was a good dog.

274
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,886
Tippie was a mixed terrier.

275
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:54,364
You know that word mixed

276
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,833
that the veterinarian
puts on the form

277
00:13:56,903 --> 00:14:00,737
when even he don't know
what the fuck you got.

278
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,774
You bring in a little mixed
puppy to a veterinarian

279
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,241
and say, what is it?

280
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,709
He'll say, well,

281
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:09,578
it's definitely not a monkey.

282
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:15,451
Tippie was actually
part Dodge Dart.

283
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,716
Poor Tippie was full of guilt,

284
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,054
so much so in fact she's
the only dog I ever had

285
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:22,458
who committed suicide.

286
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:26,191
Yeah, well, we don't say it
like that around the house.

287
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:30,224
We say she put
herself to sleep.

288
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,794
But she ran out in
front of a milk truck.

289
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,273
That's fucking suicide.

290
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:40,244
But that was her decision.

291
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:43,805
That's what
Tippie wanted to do.

292
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,510
And that's the way
it is in our family,

293
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,280
if you want to commit suicide,

294
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,322
we back you up.

295
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,788
So we supported Tippie

296
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:54,087
in her little
suicide decision,

297
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,650
then we brought
her into the pet shop,

298
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,990
threw her up on
the counter, and said,

299
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,293
give us something bigger.

300
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,765
We're trading up.

301
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,234
We was looking for
a bigger God damn dog.

302
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,635
Because Tippie
had been teenie,

303
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:10,233
even before
the truck came by.

304
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,504
The truck had
made her teenier,

305
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:16,173
wider, but teenier.

306
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,809
And we was looking for
a bigger God damn dog.

307
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,408
Not too big, you know,

308
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,818
I don't like a dog
who's bigger than I am.

309
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:26,881
It's bad enough looking
for shit in one direction

310
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,191
without having to duck
flying turds as well.

311
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,565
A good rule of thumb is

312
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:41,130
keep the dog's
asshole below eye level.

313
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:46,278
So we compromised,

314
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,245
and we got us a mid-sized dog,

315
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,339
knee high, just about
like this size here,

316
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,145
best size you can
own, by the way.

317
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,048
Most people know,

318
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,711
this is the ideal
size dog to have.

319
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,719
You know why,

320
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,119
anybody comes to visit you,

321
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:58,554
the first thing
that dog does

322
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,319
is take his nose and put it

323
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:01,860
right in their crotch.

324
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:05,124
Oohh, oohh,

325
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:08,098
he smells my dog.

326
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:24,407
No, Marge, I don't believe
that's the animal he has in mind.

327
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,819
And people get
embarrassed by that,

328
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:35,554
especially the
owner of the dog.

329
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:37,186
The owner's the one
who's saying stop that,

330
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:38,730
stop that, will you
stop that now, stop it.

331
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,060
I'm awfully sorry about this.

332
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:44,228
Not me, I say, get in
there and get some of that.

333
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,363
Get in there and sniff
that thing out, go on.

334
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,202
Listen, would you mind

335
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:50,936
spreading your
legs a little bit

336
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,501
so he can get right in there?

337
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:57,777
Yeah, stand like this for
a little while, would you?

338
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,944
Okay, looking good now.

339
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,217
So how's your mom
and dad doing, anyway?

340
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,157
Well, God bless them,
it's a wonderful couple.

341
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:10,059
Go around the back,
check it out in the back.

342
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,859
Sniff that other
thing in the back there.

343
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:13,728
What's that?

344
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,198
Well, there's two
different smells he likes,

345
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,201
what can I tell you.

346
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,167
Don't pay him no attention,

347
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:21,434
he'll be finished in
just about half an hour.

348
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:22,474
So listen, Reverend,

349
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:26,841
it's real nice of you to

350
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:28,277
come and call on us like this.

351
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:31,441
Every one of us is always
glad to see you around here,

352
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,849
especially that God damn dog.

353
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,147
Those dogs are great,

354
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:35,983
they'll break the ice

355
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,023
when a new
neighbor comes to call.

356
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,491
Hi, we're the Johnsons.

357
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,721
What's his name?

358
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:47,596
Ball Sniffer.

359
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,829
He's a crotch hound.

360
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,495
Let me know if you
want to get circumcised,

361
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:57,668
he's on duty
till 5:00 o'clock.

362
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:01,008
Dogs are a constant
source of entertainment.

363
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,345
Did you ever have a
dog that ate cat turds?

364
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,406
Some of them do,

365
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,746
some of you must know that?

366
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,184
Did you ever have a
dog eat cat turds?

367
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,118
Yeah.

368
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,053
Of course you got to
have a cat, you know.

369
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:15,423
You can't be buying cat
turds at the supermarket.

370
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,361
But it's true, some dogs
will eat cat turds, yeah.

371
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:22,026
Don't let them
lick you that day.

372
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,569
Get a bottle of
Listerine for him.

373
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:25,626
Try to make him gargle.

374
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,433
Pour it down his throat
and tell him to howl.

375
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,167
Come on, howl,

376
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:30,208
howl, God damn it.

377
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,208
Stomp on his tail.

378
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,178
Howl, I said,
God damn it, howl.

379
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,770
Oh, dogs are a lot of fun.

380
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:36,712
Did you ever have a dog

381
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,908
that ate a bunch
of colored balloons

382
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:38,950
and then he takes a shit

383
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:41,680
and it's real decorative like?

384
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,120
Or sometimes at Christmas

385
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:46,089
they'll eat some tinsel

386
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,752
and take a shiny shit.

387
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,193
Wow, look, mom,

388
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:54,255
can we hang it on the tree?

389
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:58,895
Well, it is considered
good luck in some cultures.

390
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,768
Here's a little
household hint for you.

391
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,831
This will help you
clean up after your dogs.

392
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,672
Feed your dog a
lot of rubber bands.

393
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,609
Put a lot of rubber bands
in with his regular food,

394
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,669
then when he takes a shit,

395
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:11,739
there's usually a little
loop in the end of it.

396
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,081
You just pick it
up by the loop,

397
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,677
do you know what I mean?

398
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:19,281
Throw it in the
neighbor's yard.

399
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,586
Yeah.

400
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,997
That's why I travel around,

401
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:28,465
give these little
household hints.

402
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,503
Bet you never read
that one in Heloise, huh?

403
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:37,168
Yeah, about time for me to
get a little drink of water.

404
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:39,905
Figure this stuff
is safe to drink.

405
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:41,503
Huh?

406
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,343
Actually, I don't care
if it's safe or not,

407
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,814
I drink it anyway.

408
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,476
You know why?

409
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:47,746
Because I'm an American,

410
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,378
and I expect a little cancer

411
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:52,481
in my food and water.

412
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,186
That's right.

413
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:56,694
I'm a loyal American,

414
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:57,751
and I'm not happy

415
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,320
unless I've let
government and industry

416
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:02,561
poison me a
little bit every day.

417
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:06,093
Let me have a few hundred
thousand carcinogens here.

418
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:10,407
Ah.

419
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:12,876
A little cancer
never hurt anybody.

420
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,277
Everybody needs a
little cancer, I think.

421
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:16,473
It's good for you,

422
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,517
keeps you on your toes.

423
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,575
Besides, I ain't
afraid of cancer,

424
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:23,747
I had broccoli for lunch.

425
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:26,017
Broccoli kills cancer.

426
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,080
A lot of people
don't know that,

427
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,127
it's not out yet.

428
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:31,185
It's true, you find
out you got some cancer,

429
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:34,858
get yourself a fucking
bowl of broccoli,

430
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:37,300
that'll wipe it right
out in a day or two.

431
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:38,734
Cauliflower, too.

432
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,739
Cauliflower kills
the really big cancers,

433
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,399
the ones you can
see through clothing

434
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:46,273
from across the street.

435
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,472
Broccoli kills
the little ones,

436
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:52,005
the ones that are slowly
eating you away from inside,

437
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,882
while your God damn
goofy half-educated doctor

438
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,216
keeps telling you,

439
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,882
you're doing fine, Jim.

440
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,619
In fact, bring your doctor
a bowel of broccoli,

441
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,718
he's probably got cancer, too,

442
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,626
probably picked
it up from you.

443
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:05,925
They don't know
what they're doing,

444
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,728
it's all guesswork
in a white coat.

445
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:12,794
Here, let me have a few more
sips of industrial waste.

446
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,436
Ah,

447
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:21,878
maybe, maybe I can turn them
cancers against one another.

448
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,312
That's what you got
to hope for, you know,

449
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:24,781
that you get more
than one cancer

450
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,478
so they eat each other
up instead of you.

451
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:28,781
In fact, the way
I look at it,

452
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:30,481
the most cancer you got,

453
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:33,684
the healthier you are.

454
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,090
Well, I know, some people

455
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,627
don't like you to
talk about those things,

456
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:37,787
I know that.

457
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,354
Some people don't like you
to mention certain things.

458
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,127
Some people don't
want you to say this,

459
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:44,533
some people don't
want you to say that.

460
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,195
Some people think if
you mention some things

461
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:48,136
they might happen.

462
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:52,940
Some people are
really fucking stupid.

463
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:54,172
Did you ever notice that,

464
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,645
how many really stupid people

465
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,978
you run into during the day?

466
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,952
God damn, there's a lot of
stupid bastards walking around.

467
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:03,420
Carry a little pad
and pencil with you,

468
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:07,755
you wind up with 30 or 40
names by the end of the day.

469
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,088
Look at it this way.

470
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,459
Think of how stupid
the average person is,

471
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:16,229
and then realize half of
them are stupider than that.

472
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:17,563
And it doesn't
take you very long

473
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:18,830
to spot one of them, does it.

474
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,633
Take you about
eight seconds.

475
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:24,733
You'll be listening
to some guy, and say,

476
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,973
this guy is fucking stupid.

477
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:33,517
Then,

478
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:34,813
then there are some people,

479
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:36,514
they're not stupid.

480
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,954
They're full of shit.

481
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:43,862
Huh, that doesn't take
very long to spot, either,

482
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:44,953
does it.

483
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,089
Take you about the
same amount of time.

484
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,862
You'll be listening to
some guy, saying, well,

485
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,563
he's fairly intelligent.

486
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:56,074
Ah, he's full of shit.

487
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:08,748
Then there are some
people, they're not stupid,

488
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:11,221
they're not full of shit,

489
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:14,782
they're fucking nuts.

490
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,159
Dan Quayle is all three,

491
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,561
all three,

492
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:20,689
stupid,

493
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,199
full of shit,

494
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,861
and fucking nuts.

495
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,638
And where did he
get that wife of his?

496
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,372
Have you taken a good look
at that Marilyn Quayle?

497
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:35,344
Where did he get her,

498
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,575
at a Halloween
party or something?

499
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:41,881
She looks like Prince
Charles, for Christ's sake.

500
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:43,046
Let me ask you something,

501
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:46,580
does he actually have
to fuck that woman?

502
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:49,593
Huh?

503
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:50,355
God help him,

504
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,830
I wouldn't fuck her
with a stolen dick.

505
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,769
That's my political humor.

506
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:04,240
People like it
when you're topical.

507
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:07,767
Oh, some people don't
like you to talk like that.

508
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,438
Oh, some people would
like to shut you up

509
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:10,607
for saying those things.

510
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,149
You know that,
lots of people,

511
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,276
lots of groups in this country

512
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:16,116
want to tell you how to talk,

513
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,713
tell you what you
can't talk about.

514
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:19,951
Sometimes they'll say, well,

515
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:21,083
you can talk
about something,

516
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,491
but you can't joke about it.

517
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,529
Say you can't joke about
it because it's not funny.

518
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,860
Comedians run into that
shit all the time, like rape.

519
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,058
They'll say, you
can't joke about rape.

520
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,065
Rape's not funny.

521
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,123
I say, fuck you,

522
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:33,501
I think it's hilarious,
how do you like that?

523
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,540
I can prove to you
that rape is funny.

524
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,268
Picture Porky Pig

525
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:40,869
raping Elmer Fudd.

526
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:41,742
See?

527
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,408
Hey, why do you think
they call him Porky, huh?

528
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,711
I know what
you're going to say,

529
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:48,218
Elmer was asking for it.

530
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:50,653
Elmer was coming on to Porky.

531
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,747
Porky couldn't help
himself, he got a hard-on,

532
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,019
he got horny,
he lost control,

533
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:55,821
he went out of his mind.

534
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:56,918
Lot of men talk like that,

535
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:57,893
lot of men think that way.

536
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,021
They think it's
the woman's fault.

537
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:00,257
They like to blame
the rape on the woman,

538
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,230
say, hey, she had it coming,

539
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,495
she was wearing a short skirt.

540
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:04,866
These guys think women
ought to go to prison

541
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:05,995
for being cock teasers.

542
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,834
Don't seem fair to me,

543
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,203
don't seem right,

544
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,935
but you can joke about it.

545
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,204
I believe you can
joke about anything.

546
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,044
It all depends on how
you construct the joke,

547
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:19,242
what the exaggeration is,

548
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:21,650
what the exaggeration is.

549
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,121
Because every joke
needs one exaggeration,

550
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,452
every joke needs one thing

551
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,550
to be way out of proportion.

552
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:29,491
Give you an example.

553
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,529
Did you ever see a news
story like this is the paper?

554
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:33,462
Every now and then you
run into a story that says,

555
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,261
some guy broke
into a house,

556
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:37,199
stole a lot of things,

557
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,600
and while he was in there,

558
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,537
he raped an
81-year old woman.

559
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:44,201
And I'm thinking to myself,

560
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,506
why!

561
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:48,239
What the fuck
kind of a social life

562
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:51,043
does this guy have?

563
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:52,640
I want to say,
why did you do that?

564
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:56,552
Well, she was
coming on to me.

565
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:57,418
We were dancing,

566
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:59,354
and I got horny.

567
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:00,584
Hey, she was asking for it.

568
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,457
She had on a tight bathrobe.

569
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:04,358
I say, Jesus Christ,

570
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:09,059
be a little fucking
selective next time, will you?

571
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:11,261
Now, speaking of rape.

572
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:12,530
You know what I wonder?

573
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,799
I wonder is there
more rape at the equator

574
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:17,535
or the North Pole?

575
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,167
These are the kind
of things I think about

576
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,268
when I'm sitting home alone

577
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:23,246
and the power goes out.

578
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:25,579
I wonder is there
more rape at the equator

579
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:26,583
or the North Pole.

580
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:27,710
I mean, per capita.

581
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,583
I know the
populations are different.

582
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,122
Most people think
it's the equator.

583
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,781
I think it's the North Pole.

584
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:34,189
People think it's the equator

585
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,248
because it's hot down there,

586
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:36,385
they don't wear
a lot of clothing,

587
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:37,393
guys can see women's tits,

588
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:39,953
they get horny, and there's
a lot of fucking going on.

589
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:41,829
That's exactly why there's
less rape at the equator,

590
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,891
because there's a lot
of fucking going on.

591
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,596
You can tell there's a lot
of fucking at the equator,

592
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:47,195
take a look at the
population figures.

593
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,172
Billions of people
life near the equator.

594
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:53,678
How many Eskimos
we got, 30, 35?

595
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,269
No one's getting laid
at the North Pole,

596
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,406
it's too fucking cold.

597
00:26:57,482 --> 00:26:58,449
Guys say to their wives,

598
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:00,314
hey, tonight honey,
huh, tonight, huh?

599
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:01,215
Are you crazy,

600
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,983
the wind chill
factor is 300 below.

601
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:06,490
These guys are
deprived, they're horny,

602
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:07,252
they're pent up.

603
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:08,918
Every now and
then, they bust out,

604
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:11,087
they got to rape somebody.

605
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:17,727
Now, the biggest problem
an Eskimo rapist has,

606
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,566
trying to get
wet leather leggings

607
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,766
off a woman who's kicking.

608
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:24,138
Did you ever try to
get leather pants off

609
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,177
of someone who doesn't
want to take them off?

610
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,974
You would lose your
hard on in the process.

611
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,605
Up at the North Pole,
your dick would shrivel up

612
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:33,082
like a stack of dimes.

613
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:40,490
That's another
thing I wonder.

614
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,720
I wonder, does a
rapist have a hard on

615
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,887
when he leaves the
house in the morning,

616
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,453
or does he develop
it during the day

617
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:49,659
when he's walking around
looking for somebody?

618
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:50,895
These are the
kind of thoughts

619
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:54,666
that kept me out of
the really good schools.

620
00:27:57,943 --> 00:28:00,241
Now I probably got the
feminists all pissed off at me

621
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:01,904
because I'm joking about rape.

622
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,210
Feminists want to
control your language.

623
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:06,011
Feminists want to
tell you how to talk.

624
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,073
And they're not alone,

625
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:08,084
they're not alone,

626
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:09,245
I'm not picking
on the feminists,

627
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:10,982
they got a lot of
company in this country.

628
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,148
There's a lot of groups,

629
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:13,816
lot of institutions
in this country

630
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,757
want to control your language,

631
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:17,294
tell you what you can say

632
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,761
and what you can't say.

633
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,025
Government wants to tell
you some things you can't say

634
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,862
because they're
against the law.

635
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:23,901
Or you can't say this

636
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:25,163
because it's
against a regulation.

637
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:26,465
Or here's something
you can't say

638
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,335
because it's a secret.

639
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:29,704
You can't tell him that

640
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:31,743
because he's not
cleared to know that.

641
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,573
Government wants to
control information

642
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:34,703
and control language

643
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,044
because that's the
way you control thought.

644
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:39,242
And basically that's
the game they're in.

645
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:40,341
Same with religion.

646
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:42,284
Religion is nothing
but mind control.

647
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:44,345
Religion is just trying
to control your mind,

648
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:45,412
control your thoughts,

649
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,752
so they're going to
tell you some things

650
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:49,259
you shouldn't say
because they're sins.

651
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,295
And besides telling you
things you shouldn't say,

652
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:52,887
religion's going to suggest

653
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:54,898
to you some things
you ought to be saying.

654
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:56,160
Here's something you
ought to say first thing

655
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,360
when you wake
up in the morning.

656
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:58,368
Here's something
you ought to say

657
00:28:58,437 --> 00:28:59,529
just before you
go to sleep at night.

658
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:00,832
Here's something we always say

659
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,067
on the third Wednesday in April
after the first full moon in Spring

660
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:05,837
at 4:00 when the bells ring.

661
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,674
Religion is
always suggesting

662
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,475
things you ought to be saying,

663
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:11,709
same with political
groups of all kinds,

664
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:12,841
political activists,

665
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:13,942
anti-biased groups,

666
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:15,008
special interest groups

667
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,920
are going to suggest the
correct political vocabulary,

668
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:19,820
the way you ought
to be saying things,

669
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,654
and that's where
the feminists come in.

670
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:23,250
Now, as I said,

671
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,795
I got nothing
against the feminists.

672
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:27,058
In fact, I happen to agree

673
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:29,760
with most of the feminist
philosophy I have read.

674
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:32,360
I agree for instance
that for the most part,

675
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,564
men are vain,
ignorant, greedy,

676
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:41,977
brutal assholes who've just
about ruined this planet...

677
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:43,480
Who've just about
ruined this planet

678
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:44,480
because they're afraid

679
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:48,485
someone might have a bigger
dick out there somewhere.

680
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:51,784
Men are basically insecure
about the size of their dicks,

681
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:54,087
and so they go to war over it.

682
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,854
You don't have to be
a political scientist

683
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:56,859
or a history major

684
00:29:56,928 --> 00:30:00,489
to see the bigger dick
foreign policy theory at work.

685
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:01,589
It goes something like this,

686
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:02,724
what, they have bigger dicks?

687
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,564
Bomb them.

688
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,364
And of course,

689
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:06,665
the bombs and
the bullets and the rockets

690
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,603
are all shaped like dicks.

691
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:10,334
I don't understand
that part of it,

692
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,399
but it is part
of the equation.

693
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,446
So I agree with that
abstract, that man,

694
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:16,242
men,

695
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,246
males,

696
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,543
have pushed the technology

697
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:21,950
that just about has this
planet in a stranglehold.

698
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,421
Mother Earth, raped
again, guess who?

699
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:29,153
Eh, she was asking for it.

700
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,489
I also happen to like it

701
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:33,690
when feminists attack
these fat ass housewives

702
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,323
who think there's
nothing more to life

703
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,766
than sitting home on the
telephone drinking coffee,

704
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:41,101
watching TV and pumping out
a baby every nine months.

705
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:48,136
Ba boom, ba boom, ba boom,
ba boom, ba boom.

706
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:50,977
Will seven be enough, Bob?

707
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:53,779
Ba boom, ba boom.

708
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,217
But what's the alternative?

709
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:56,413
What's the alternative

710
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:59,150
to pumping out a
unit every nine months?

711
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:02,921
Pointless careerism?

712
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:05,519
Putting on a man tailored
suit with shoulder pads

713
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:08,122
and imitating all the
worst behavior of men?

714
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,327
This is the noblest thing
that women can think of,

715
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:12,302
to take a job in a
criminal corporation

716
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,632
that's poisoning
the environment

717
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,263
and robbing customers
out of their money?

718
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,898
This is the worthiest
thing they can think of?

719
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,272
Isn't there something
nobler they can do

720
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:19,867
to be helping
this planet heal?

721
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:21,003
You don't hear much about that

722
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,239
from these middle class women.

723
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:24,214
I've noticed that most
of these feminists

724
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:25,749
are white, middle class women,

725
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:26,749
they don't give a shit

726
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:28,046
about black women's problems,

727
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,518
they don't care
about Latino women.

728
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:30,714
All they're interested in

729
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:32,552
is their own
reproductive freedom

730
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,148
and their pocketbooks.

731
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,353
But when it comes to
changing the language,

732
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:38,760
I think they make
some good points,

733
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,663
because we do
think in language.

734
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,894
And so the quality of our
thoughts and ideas

735
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:45,163
could only be as good

736
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,330
as the quality
of our language.

737
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,236
So maybe some of
this patriarchal shit

738
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:50,296
ought to go away.

739
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,275
I think spokesmen
ought to be spokesperson.

740
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:54,539
I think chairman ought
to be chairperson.

741
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,672
I think mankind
ought to be humankind.

742
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,010
But they take it too far.

743
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,311
They take themselves
too seriously.

744
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:00,373
The exaggerate.

745
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:01,817
They want me to call
that thing in the street

746
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:02,944
a person hole cover.

747
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:06,457
I think that's taking
it a little bit too far.

748
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:07,684
What would you
call a lady's man,

749
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,659
a person's person?

750
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,992
That would make a
he-man an it person.

751
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:14,429
Little kids would be afraid
of the boogie person.

752
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:17,195
They'd look up in the sky and
see the person in the moon.

753
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,294
Guys would say come back
here and fight like a person,

754
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:21,305
and we'd all sing,
For It's a Jolly Good Person.

755
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:22,897
That's the kind of
thing you would hear

756
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:25,636
on Late Night with
David Letterperson.

757
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,473
You know what I mean?

758
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:37,619
So I think it's
an exaggeration,

759
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,850
and I like to
piss off any group

760
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:42,620
that takes itself a
little bit too seriously,

761
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:45,686
and it does not take
a lot of imagination

762
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:47,959
to piss off a feminist.

763
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:49,091
All you got to do

764
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,759
is run into
N.O.W. Headquarters

765
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:52,632
or Ms. Magazine and say,

766
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,638
Hey, which one of you
cute little cupcakes

767
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:56,606
wants to come home
and cook me a nice meal

768
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:58,666
and give me a blow job?

769
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,643
Blow job.

770
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:10,412
Oh, that pisses them off.

771
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,716
You want to piss
off a feminist,

772
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,087
call her a cum catcher,

773
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,422
that'll get her attention.

774
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,324
Ah, don't act disgusted,

775
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:18,828
don't act disgusted,

776
00:33:18,897 --> 00:33:19,886
half of you are
going to go home

777
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:22,694
and go down on each
other tonight, remember?

778
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:24,462
If you're willing
to swallow cum,

779
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:25,594
let's not make believe

780
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:29,128
something I said was
disgusting, okay?

781
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:30,469
All right.

782
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,735
Let's not have a
double standard here,

783
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:37,179
one standard
will do just fine.

784
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:40,081
Now, speaking of blowjobs.

785
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,952
Do you know why
they call it a blowjob?

786
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,582
So it'll sound
like it has kind of

787
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:50,526
a work ethic attached to it.

788
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:51,527
Make you feel like

789
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:55,862
you did something
useful for the economy.

790
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:57,629
Long as I'm being
a complete pig up here,

791
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,500
let me ask you
guys a question.

792
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:04,099
Let me ask one
question of the men.

793
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:07,110
Are you ever able to watch
a woman eating a banana

794
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:12,081
and not think
about a blowjob, huh?

795
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:16,814
I can't do it.

796
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,914
I can't do it, and I know
why, I'm a sick evil fuck,

797
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,652
I know that.

798
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,318
I accept that.

799
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:24,123
But I can't do it.

800
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:25,423
Eating a banana,
eating a pickle,

801
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:28,057
licking on an
ice cream cone.

802
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:28,963
I'm saying to myself,

803
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:35,097
look at the
tongue on her, wow.

804
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:36,401
So you women be careful

805
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:40,570
when you're standing out
in front of that Hagen Daas,

806
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:43,580
because God damn
it, we're watching.

807
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:46,776
And God damn it,
we're thinking.

808
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,585
Another woman's
issue, prostitution.

809
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,214
I do not understand

810
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,020
why prostitution is illegal.

811
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,924
Why should
prostitution be illegal?

812
00:34:56,995 --> 00:34:57,962
Selling is legal,

813
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,724
fucking is legal.

814
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:04,258
Why isn't selling
fucking legal?

815
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:05,029
You know,

816
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,502
why should it be illegal

817
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:07,367
to sell something

818
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:11,239
that's perfectly
legal to give away?

819
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:14,107
I can't follow the
logic on that at all.

820
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:15,441
Of all the things
you can do too a person,

821
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:16,571
giving someone an orgasm

822
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:19,378
is hardly the worst
thing in the world.

823
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:20,713
In the Army,
they give you a medal

824
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,276
for spraying Napalm on people.

825
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:24,184
Civilian life,

826
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:26,883
you go to jail for
giving someone an orgasm.

827
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,153
Maybe I'm not supposed
to understand it.

828
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:30,717
I got strange ideas anyway.

829
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:31,659
You know what I think

830
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:33,356
they ought to do with that
Miss American contest?

831
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:34,420
I think they ought to make

832
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:40,768
the losers keep coming
back until they win.

833
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:42,864
I'll tell you.

834
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:43,965
That would get a little spooky

835
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:46,806
after about 35
years or so, huh?

836
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:50,473
I just want to
work on world peace.

837
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:54,348
Fine, sit down before
you fall down, will you?

838
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:58,788
And pick up all
these Goddamn batons.

839
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:04,185
I got a lot of ideas.

840
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:05,160
You know what I think?

841
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:09,360
I think Kleenex ought to
have little targets on them.

842
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:10,526
Wouldn't that
be a good idea,

843
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:12,331
little bulls eyes right in
the middle of the Kleenex,

844
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:14,234
make it kind of sporting
when you're with your friends.

845
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:16,170
(Blowing nose sound)

846
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:19,108
Look Dave, an 85.

847
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,438
That's a good idea.

848
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,039
I got a lot of good ideas.

849
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:28,176
Trouble is,
most of them suck.

850
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:30,448
I got a lot of good ideas
for new products like that.

851
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,251
That's what I think
about on my off duty hours,

852
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:33,290
things we need,

853
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,087
products we ought to
have that we don't have.

854
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,091
You know what
we ought to have,

855
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,128
we ought to have
a diet salad dressing

856
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,664
called 500 Islands.

857
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:45,169
See, good God damn
ideas, like that, huh?

858
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:46,533
A Christian deodorant,

859
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:49,869
Thou Shalt Not Smell.

860
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:56,642
How about a feminine
hygiene spray called Sprunt.

861
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,510
Huh?

862
00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:00,176
Well, you'd never
forget the name, would you?

863
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:03,084
It would always be on the
tip of your tongue, see?

864
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:05,145
Marketing, marketing,

865
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,850
that's where I belong,

866
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:09,086
among other places.

867
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,717
Marketing.

868
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:10,852
Here's an idea I got.

869
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:11,953
This is a yo-yo

870
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,464
with a 2,000-foot string.

871
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:17,968
You use it when you
visit the Grand Canyon.

872
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:19,060
See, I'm a visionary,

873
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:21,002
I'm ahead of my time.

874
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,633
Trouble is, I'm only about
an hour and a half ahead.

875
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:25,403
Here's a good idea,

876
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:27,034
a light bulb
that only shines

877
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:30,012
on things worth looking at.

878
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,412
Yeah, kind of too idealistic,

879
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:33,279
never make any money
on a thing like that.

880
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:34,978
Here's something that's
going to make you a fortune,

881
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:35,781
get in on this.

882
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:37,480
This is a roach spray,

883
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:38,852
it doesn't kill the roaches,

884
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,413
but it fills them
with self-doubt

885
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:46,191
as to whether or not
they're in the right house.

886
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:46,593
Yeah.

887
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:48,623
Here's something
I'm trying to interest

888
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,361
the Japanese
electronics firms in this.

889
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:51,902
This would be a
great product for Sony.

890
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,495
This is a combination
cassette player

891
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:57,632
and colostomy bag.

892
00:37:57,709 --> 00:38:01,611
It's called Shitman.

893
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:03,474
Huh?

894
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:04,310
Sure.

895
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:06,282
Well, you never see that.

896
00:38:06,551 --> 00:38:08,041
You never see that.

897
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,814
You never see a guy
jogging down the street,

898
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:11,650
listening to a Shitman.

899
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:14,214
No, that's one of those
things you never see.

900
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,123
There's a lot of
things you never see.

901
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:17,252
And you don't know
you don't see them

902
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:18,522
because you don't see them.

903
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:20,120
You got to see something first
to know you never saw it,

904
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:21,563
then you see it and say,
hey I never saw that.

905
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,363
Too late, you just saw it.

906
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:26,369
I know things you never see.

907
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:27,665
You never see a Rolls Royce

908
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:29,604
with a bumper
sticker that says,

909
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:33,166
shit happens.

910
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:34,404
You never see
a really big tall,

911
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:40,782
fat Chinese
guy with red hair.

912
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:41,910
You never see a wheelchair

913
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:45,422
with the roll bar.

914
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,718
You never see
someone taking a shit

915
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:50,056
while running at full speed.

916
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:51,891
And you never see a picture
of Margaret Thatcher

917
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:55,023
strapping on a dildo.

918
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,097
You'll never see it.

919
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,863
That's one of those
things you never see.

920
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:05,203
Then there are some
things you never hear,

921
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:06,243
that makes sense.

922
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,709
Some things you never hear.

923
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:08,939
You never hear this,

924
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:12,312
Dad, you really
ought to drink more.

925
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:16,381
Here's something you
don't hear too often

926
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:17,546
Do what you want to the girl,

927
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:20,318
but leave me alone.

928
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:27,291
Here is something
no one has ever heard,

929
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,799
ever,

930
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,732
ever.

931
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:33,828
As soon as I put this
hot poker in my ass,

932
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:36,840
I'm going to
chop my dick off.

933
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:41,706
You know why you
never heard that?

934
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:44,475
Right, no one
ever said that.

935
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:45,880
Which to me is the
more amazing thing,

936
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,248
no one ever thought to
say that before tonight.

937
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,718
I'm the first
person in the world

938
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:50,776
to put those words together

939
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,254
in that particular order.

940
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:55,087
First guy, number one.

941
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,028
Here's something
you don't hear too often,

942
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:06,434
Honey, let's
sell the children,

943
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:07,436
move to Zanzibar

944
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:10,736
and begin taking
opium rectally.

945
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:14,772
Mom?

946
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:15,972
Mom, I got a
big date tonight,

947
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:19,448
can I borrow a
French tickler from you?

948
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:24,945
Then there are some things

949
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:27,115
you don't want to hear.

950
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:30,456
Some things you just
flat don't want to hear.

951
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,928
You don't want to come
home from work and hear,

952
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:35,795
honey, remember how
we told the children

953
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:41,464
never to play on
the railroad tracks?

954
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:43,234
You don't want to be sitting
in your doctor's office

955
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:44,569
and hear this.

956
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:46,109
Well, Jim,
there's no reason why

957
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:49,340
you shouldn't live
another 20 to 30 years.

958
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:53,611
However, you will be bleeding
constantly from both eyes.

959
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,546
Here's something
I don't want to hear,

960
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:00,022
I'm pregnant,
you're the father,

961
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:02,855
and I'm going to
kill all three of us.

962
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:06,463
Calm down,

963
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:08,499
have some dip.

964
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:15,237
Honey, it's the police.

965
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,171
They have a search warrant,

966
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:18,674
and the 300 kilos of cocaine

967
00:41:18,743 --> 00:41:21,940
are still sitting
out in the living room.

968
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:26,775
Here's something
nobody wants to hear,

969
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:28,512
nobody wants to hear this.

970
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:29,348
Try to think back

971
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,856
to when this was
appropriate to your life.

972
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:34,789
You and your fiancé

973
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:36,156
have been invited to

974
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:39,594
your mom and dad's
house for dinner

975
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,564
for the first time.

976
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,929
Halfway through dinner,

977
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,798
your fiancé
stands up and says,

978
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,770
I'll be right back.

979
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:51,366
I got to take a dump.

980
00:41:58,482 --> 00:41:59,779
There seems to be

981
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:02,877
no really gentile way

982
00:42:02,954 --> 00:42:08,586
of announcing
publicly a dump.

983
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:09,956
And frankly, I'm not
impressed with people

984
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:10,994
who tell me what
they're going to do

985
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:13,030
when they go to the
bathroom in the first place.

986
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:13,722
Doesn't it bother you,

987
00:42:13,798 --> 00:42:14,526
people that announce it,

988
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:15,998
I'll be right back,
I'm going to take a shit.

989
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:18,035
Never mind.

990
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:18,898
Do what you have to do

991
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,961
and leave me out of it,

992
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:24,496
and don't describe it
when you come back.

993
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:25,507
Boy, you should have seen...

994
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:27,942
Never mind.

995
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:29,309
It set off the smoke alarm.

996
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,507
Never mind.

997
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:43,118
I have never
understood that,

998
00:42:43,194 --> 00:42:45,924
nor have a cared for it.

999
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:47,259
Something else
I don't care for,

1000
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:49,561
these organ donor programs.

1001
00:42:49,634 --> 00:42:51,101
That shit bother
you a little bit?

1002
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:52,760
Sounds like
Josef Mengele's

1003
00:42:52,837 --> 00:42:55,271
been sitting on some of
those meetings or something?

1004
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:56,636
Organ donor programs.

1005
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:58,402
The thing that bothers
me the most about it is

1006
00:42:58,476 --> 00:43:02,674
they're run by the
Motor Vehicle Bureau.

1007
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:03,645
I figure, hey, shit,

1008
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:05,545
you got to wait on a line
that long for a kidney,

1009
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:09,074
fuck it, do without.

1010
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:10,984
It's the Motor Vehicle
Bureau in most states

1011
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:12,283
who send you the little card

1012
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:14,324
you're supposed to carry
right next to your wallet,

1013
00:43:14,392 --> 00:43:16,053
right next to your
driver's license,

1014
00:43:16,127 --> 00:43:16,855
in your wallet,

1015
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:17,622
little card.

1016
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:18,753
You're supposed
to fill it out

1017
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:20,592
and on it you're
supposed to list

1018
00:43:20,665 --> 00:43:22,462
the organs you're
willing to give

1019
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:23,898
in case you die.

1020
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:26,960
Are these people out of their
fucking minds or something?

1021
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:28,437
Do you honestly believe

1022
00:43:28,506 --> 00:43:30,406
that if a paramedic
finds that card on you

1023
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:31,498
in an automobile accident,

1024
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:33,338
he's going to try
to save your life?

1025
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:39,281
Bullshit, he's looking
for parts, man.

1026
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,840
Absolutely.

1027
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:41,543
Look, Dan,

1028
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,782
here's that lower intestine
we've been looking for.

1029
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:45,913
Never mind the oxygen,

1030
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,254
this man's a donor.

1031
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:49,554
Bullshit, they want
something of mine,

1032
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:50,958
they can have my
rectum and my anus,

1033
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:51,892
that's all I'm giving,

1034
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:52,861
take them and get out of here.

1035
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,522
Put them in your bag and
get the fuck out of my life,

1036
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:56,327
that's all I'm giving.

1037
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,061
I don't want some guy
poking around in me,

1038
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,295
hoping I die.

1039
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,667
I want to live.

1040
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:01,830
I don't want to die.

1041
00:44:01,906 --> 00:44:04,170
That's the
whole secret of life,

1042
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:06,573
not dying.

1043
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,340
I figured that shit out
alone in third grade.

1044
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:12,914
And don't be pulling
any plugs on me, either.

1045
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,578
Here's another bunch of
macho asshole bullshit

1046
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,881
floating around
this country,

1047
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:19,514
people talking about
ah, pull the plug on me.

1048
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:20,852
If I'm ever like that,

1049
00:44:20,925 --> 00:44:22,187
if I'm comatose,

1050
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:23,487
if I'm like a vegetable,

1051
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:25,051
pull the plug on me.

1052
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:26,118
Fuck you,

1053
00:44:26,197 --> 00:44:29,792
leave my plug alone.

1054
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:36,832
Get an extension
cord for my plug.

1055
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:37,999
I want
everything you got,

1056
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:40,669
tubes, cords, plugs,
probes, electrodes, IV's,

1057
00:44:40,745 --> 00:44:41,541
you got something,

1058
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:43,910
stick it in me, man.

1059
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,744
You find out I got a
hole I didn't know I had,

1060
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:48,785
put a fucking plug in it.

1061
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:49,615
Vegetable, shit,

1062
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:53,123
I don't care if
I look like an artichoke.

1063
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:57,320
Save my ass.

1064
00:44:57,395 --> 00:44:58,555
There's three things I want

1065
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:00,028
if I'm ever
in that condition,

1066
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:01,655
three things
I got to have,

1067
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:02,426
ice cream,

1068
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,125
morphine

1069
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,168
and television.

1070
00:45:05,236 --> 00:45:07,727
You give me that ice
cream every two hours,

1071
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:10,774
give me that morphine about...

1072
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:13,469
every ten minutes,

1073
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:16,604
and turn on the fucking TV.

1074
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,140
I want to see Geraldo.

1075
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,549
And don't be
coming to visit me,

1076
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,178
I got no time for life people,

1077
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:25,722
I'm brain dead here.

1078
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:28,759
You people got no respect
for the brain dead?

1079
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:29,952
Hey, you got
to be brain dead

1080
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:32,757
to watch Geraldo
in the first place.

1081
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:33,854
You might as well watch him

1082
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:36,422
when you're
clinically brain dead.

1083
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:42,730
There's one other
thing I thought about

1084
00:45:42,807 --> 00:45:44,638
concerning this
comatose thing,

1085
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:46,107
and this might
help you someday.

1086
00:45:46,177 --> 00:45:47,405
This little
piece of information

1087
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:48,706
might come in handy

1088
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:49,837
sometime in the future

1089
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:51,313
if you're in
this circumstance.

1090
00:45:51,382 --> 00:45:53,441
If you knew a family,

1091
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:54,347
if you knew a family

1092
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,818
and one of them
was a homosexual

1093
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:59,219
and he was in an
automobile accident

1094
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:01,019
and he was comatose,

1095
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:04,994
you could always comfort
that family by saying,

1096
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:07,997
well, look at it this way,

1097
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:09,430
he was a fruit,

1098
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:14,494
now he's a vegetable.

1099
00:46:14,572 --> 00:46:17,632
Listen,

1100
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:20,905
at least he's still
in the produce section.

1101
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:28,283
Now I probably got some
other group pissed off at me

1102
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:30,252
because I said fruit.

1103
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:31,185
There's a different group

1104
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:32,654
to get pissed off
at you in this country

1105
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:34,816
for everything you're
not supposed to say.

1106
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:35,722
Can't say fruit,

1107
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:36,555
can't say faggot,

1108
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:37,389
can't say queer,

1109
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,428
can't say Nancy boy,

1110
00:46:38,496 --> 00:46:40,123
can't say pansy.

1111
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:42,563
Can't say nigger, boogie,
jig, jiggaboo, skinhead,

1112
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,727
jungle bunny, moolie,
moolie yan or schwarz.

1113
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:51,639
Can't say yid, heeb, zeeb,
kike, mackie, dego, ginny,

1114
00:46:51,709 --> 00:46:56,203
wop, ginzo, greaser,
greaseball, spick, beaner,

1115
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:02,310
oya, tiger, PR, Mick,
donkey, turkey, limey,

1116
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:07,483
frog, squarehead, kraut,
jerry, Hun, chink, jap,

1117
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:12,325
nip, slope, slopehead,
zip, zipper head, gook.

1118
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:16,594
There is absolutely
nothing wrong...

1119
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,470
There is absolutely
nothing wrong

1120
00:47:25,543 --> 00:47:27,374
with any of those words

1121
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:30,174
in and of themselves.

1122
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:31,612
They're only words.

1123
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,479
It's the context that counts.

1124
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:34,916
It's the user.

1125
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:36,748
It's the intention
behind the words

1126
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:37,980
that makes them good or bad.

1127
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:39,488
The words are
completely neutral

1128
00:47:39,557 --> 00:47:40,819
the words are innocent.

1129
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:42,882
I get tired of people
talking about bad words

1130
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,052
and bad language.

1131
00:47:44,128 --> 00:47:44,890
Bullshit.

1132
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:48,420
It's the context that
makes them good or bad,

1133
00:47:48,499 --> 00:47:52,833
the context that makes
them good or bad.

1134
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:54,768
For instance,

1135
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:56,066
you take the word nigger.

1136
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,505
There is absolutely
nothing wrong

1137
00:47:57,575 --> 00:48:00,043
with the word nigger
in and of itself.

1138
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:01,975
It's the racist
asshole that's using it

1139
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,445
that you ought to
be concerned about.

1140
00:48:03,514 --> 00:48:06,005
We don't care when Richard
Pryor or Eddie Murphy says it.

1141
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:06,811
Why?

1142
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,852
Because we know
they're not racists.

1143
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:13,049
They're niggers.

1144
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:14,988
Context.

1145
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:16,424
Context.

1146
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:17,983
We don't mind their context

1147
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:20,030
because we know
they're black.

1148
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:21,257
Hey, I know I'm Whitey,

1149
00:48:21,332 --> 00:48:22,390
the blue-eyed devil patio,

1150
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:25,765
fake gray boy, honkie,
motherfucker myself.

1151
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:27,827
Don't bother my ass.

1152
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,463
They're only words.

1153
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,974
You can't be afraid of
words that speak the truth,

1154
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:33,441
even if it's an
unpleasant truth

1155
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:34,977
like the fact
that there's a bigot

1156
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:36,307
and a racist in
every living room

1157
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,177
on every street corner
in this country.

1158
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:39,978
I don't like words
that hide the truth.

1159
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,881
I don't like words
that conceal reality.

1160
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:43,180
I don't like euphemisms

1161
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:44,744
or euphemistic language.

1162
00:48:44,822 --> 00:48:46,084
And American English

1163
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:47,748
is loaded with euphemisms,

1164
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:49,253
because Americans
have a lot of trouble

1165
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:50,486
dealing with reality.

1166
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:53,153
Americans have trouble
facing the truth,

1167
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,494
so they invent the
kind of a soft language

1168
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:57,295
to protect themselves from it.

1169
00:48:57,368 --> 00:48:59,598
And it gets worse
with every generation.

1170
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,695
For some reason it just
keeps getting worse.

1171
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,000
I'll give you
an example of that.

1172
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:05,132
There's a
condition in combat,

1173
00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:06,733
most people know about it.

1174
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:09,438
It's when a fighting
person's nervous system

1175
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:12,573
has been stressed to its
absolute peak and maximum,

1176
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:13,947
can't take any more input.

1177
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:15,952
The nervous system
has either snapped

1178
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,181
or is about to snap.

1179
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:19,813
In the First World War

1180
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:23,451
that condition was
called shell shock.

1181
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:26,223
Simple, honest,
direct language,

1182
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,457
two syllables.

1183
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:28,930
Shell shock.

1184
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:31,593
Almost sounds like
the guns themselves.

1185
00:49:31,669 --> 00:49:34,365
That was 70 years ago.

1186
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:36,565
Then a whole
generation went by,

1187
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,130
and the Second World War
came along

1188
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:40,768
and the very
same combat condition

1189
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:43,506
was called battle fatigue.

1190
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:44,672
Four syllables now,

1191
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:46,181
it takes a little
longer to say,

1192
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:48,810
doesn't seem to hurt as much.

1193
00:49:48,886 --> 00:49:51,081
Fatigue is a
nicer word than shock.

1194
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:52,383
Shell shock,

1195
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:55,391
battle fatigue.

1196
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:58,292
Then we had the war
in Korea in 1950,

1197
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:00,796
Madison Avenue was
riding high by that time,

1198
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:03,731
and the very
same combat condition

1199
00:50:03,801 --> 00:50:07,100
was called
Operational Exhaustion.

1200
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:09,162
Hey, we're up to
eight syllables now,

1201
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:11,104
and the humanity
has been squeezed

1202
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:12,369
completely out
of the phrase,

1203
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:13,933
it's totally sterile now.

1204
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,774
Operational Exhaustion.

1205
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:16,540
Sounds like something

1206
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:19,582
that might
happen to your car.

1207
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,914
Then of course came
the war in Viet Nam,

1208
00:50:21,985 --> 00:50:23,009
which has only been over

1209
00:50:23,087 --> 00:50:24,987
for about 16 or 17 years.

1210
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:26,955
And thanks to
the lies and deceits

1211
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,184
surrounding that war,

1212
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:29,691
I guess it's no surprise

1213
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,058
that the very same condition

1214
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:36,566
was called Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder.

1215
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:37,657
Still eight syllables,

1216
00:50:37,735 --> 00:50:40,932
but we've added a hyphen,

1217
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:44,997
and the pain is completely
buried under jargon,

1218
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:48,101
Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder.

1219
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:51,113
I bet you if we'd have still
been calling it shell shock,

1220
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:52,671
some of them
Viet Nam veterans

1221
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:56,618
might have gotten the attention
they needed at the time.

1222
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:10,861
But it didn't happen,

1223
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:12,902
and one of the reasons is

1224
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:15,564
because we were
using that soft language,

1225
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:18,199
that language that
takes the life out of life.

1226
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:20,140
And it is a
function of time,

1227
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:22,678
it does keep getting worse,
give you another example.

1228
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,179
Sometime during my life,

1229
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:25,579
sometime during my life

1230
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:29,983
toilet paper
became bathroom tissue.

1231
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:33,147
I wasn't notified of this,

1232
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:35,191
no one asked me
if I agreed with it.

1233
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:36,021
It just happened.

1234
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,584
Toilet paper
became bathroom tissue.

1235
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:41,756
Sneakers became
running shoes.

1236
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:44,767
False teeth became
dental appliances.

1237
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:47,235
Medicine became medication.

1238
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:50,762
Information became
directory assistance.

1239
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:53,332
The dump
became the landfill.

1240
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:56,607
Car crashes became
automobile accidents.

1241
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:01,049
Partly cloudy
became partly sunny.

1242
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:04,451
Motels became motor lodges.

1243
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:07,581
House trailers
became mobile homes.

1244
00:52:07,658 --> 00:52:12,459
Used cars became previously
owned transportation.

1245
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:15,555
Room service became
guest room dining.

1246
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:20,592
And constipation became
occasional irregularity.

1247
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:23,204
When I was a little kid,

1248
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:24,865
if I got sick they wanted
me to go to the hospital

1249
00:52:24,942 --> 00:52:26,204
and see the doctor.

1250
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:27,538
Now they want me to go

1251
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:29,909
to a health
maintenance organization,

1252
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,379
or a wellness center

1253
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:34,815
to consult a healthcare
delivery professional.

1254
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:36,978
Poor people used
to live in slums.

1255
00:52:37,054 --> 00:52:38,919
Now the economically
disadvantaged

1256
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:43,221
occupies substandard
housing in the inner cities.

1257
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:45,523
And they're broke.

1258
00:52:45,596 --> 00:52:46,654
They're broke.

1259
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,893
They don't have a negative
cash flow position,

1260
00:52:49,967 --> 00:52:52,697
they're fucking broke.

1261
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:54,293
Because a lot of
them were fired.

1262
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:55,235
You know, fired,

1263
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:57,239
management wanted to
curtail redundancies

1264
00:52:57,307 --> 00:52:58,968
in the human resources area,

1265
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:00,600
so many people are no longer

1266
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:03,009
viable members
of the workforce.

1267
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:06,311
Smug, greedy,
well-fed white people

1268
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:08,749
have invented a language
to conceal their sins,

1269
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:10,013
it's as simple as that.

1270
00:53:10,087 --> 00:53:12,021
The CIA doesn't
kill anybody any more.

1271
00:53:12,089 --> 00:53:14,023
They neutralize people,

1272
00:53:14,091 --> 00:53:16,855
or they depopulate the area.

1273
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,121
The government doesn't lie,

1274
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,720
it engages in disinformation.

1275
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:23,891
The Pentagon actually
measures nuclear radiation

1276
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:27,994
and something they
call Sunshine Units.

1277
00:53:28,071 --> 00:53:30,596
Israeli murderers
are called Commandos.

1278
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:33,370
Arab Commandos
are called terrorists.

1279
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:36,071
Contra killers are
called Freedom fighters.

1280
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:38,114
Well, if crime fighters
fight crime

1281
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:39,808
and firefighters fight fire,

1282
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,443
what do
Freedom Fighters fight?

1283
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:45,454
They never mention that
part of it to us, do they?

1284
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:48,286
Never mention
that part of it.

1285
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:56,295
Some of this stuff is just
silly, we all know that.

1286
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:57,355
Like on the airlines,

1287
00:53:57,434 --> 00:53:59,163
they say they
want to pre board.

1288
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,567
Well, what the
hell is pre board,

1289
00:54:00,637 --> 00:54:01,763
what does that mean?

1290
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:06,366
To get on before you get on?

1291
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:09,071
They say they're going to
pre board those passengers

1292
00:54:09,146 --> 00:54:11,808
in need of
special assistance.

1293
00:54:11,882 --> 00:54:13,850
Cripples.

1294
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,818
Simple, honest,
direct language.

1295
00:54:16,887 --> 00:54:18,912
There's no shame
attached to the word cripple

1296
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:20,854
that I can find
in any dictionary,

1297
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:21,948
no shame attached to it.

1298
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:24,118
In fact it's a word used
in Bible translations,

1299
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:25,821
Jesus healed the cripples.

1300
00:54:25,896 --> 00:54:26,794
Doesn't take seven words

1301
00:54:26,863 --> 00:54:28,797
to describe that condition.

1302
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:29,832
But we don't
have any cripples

1303
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,492
in this country any more.

1304
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:36,505
We have the
physically challenged.

1305
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:39,599
Is that a grotesque
enough evasion for you?

1306
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:42,702
How about differently abled?

1307
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,076
I've heard them called that,

1308
00:54:44,147 --> 00:54:46,047
differently abled.

1309
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,107
You can't even call these
people handicapped anymore.

1310
00:54:48,185 --> 00:54:49,743
They'll say,
we're not handicapped,

1311
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:52,618
we're handy capable.

1312
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:54,987
These poor people have been
bullshitted by the system

1313
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:56,992
into believing that if you
change the name of the condition,

1314
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,721
somehow you'll
change the condition.

1315
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:02,356
Well, hey cousin
doesn't happen.

1316
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:07,631
Doesn't happen.

1317
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:09,672
We have no more deaf
people in this country,

1318
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,332
hearing impaired.

1319
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:12,841
No one's blind any more,

1320
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:15,377
partially sighted
or visually impaired.

1321
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:17,208
We have no more
stupid people.

1322
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,647
Everybody has a
learning disorder,

1323
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:23,584
or he's minimally exceptional.

1324
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:26,145
How would you like to be
told that about your child,

1325
00:55:26,223 --> 00:55:28,487
he's minimally exceptional.

1326
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:33,222
Oh, thank God for that.

1327
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:36,663
Psychologists actually have
started calling ugly people

1328
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:41,727
those with severe
appearance deficits.

1329
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:43,329
It's getting so
bad that any day now

1330
00:55:43,407 --> 00:55:45,068
I expect to hear a rape victim

1331
00:55:45,142 --> 00:55:50,239
referred to as an
unwilling sperm recipient.

1332
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:58,420
And we have no more old
people in this country,

1333
00:55:58,488 --> 00:55:59,455
no more old people.

1334
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:01,388
We shipped them all away,

1335
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:05,918
and we brought in
these senior citizens.

1336
00:56:05,996 --> 00:56:07,827
Isn't that a
typically American

1337
00:56:07,898 --> 00:56:09,763
20th Century phrase?

1338
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:12,461
Bloodless, lifeless.

1339
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:14,504
No pulse in one of them.

1340
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:16,801
A senior citizen.

1341
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:17,965
And I've accepted that one,

1342
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,167
I've come to terms with it,

1343
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:20,300
I know it's here to stay.

1344
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,366
We'll never get rid of it,

1345
00:56:21,445 --> 00:56:22,639
that's what they're
going to be called,

1346
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:23,680
so I'll relax on that.

1347
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:24,839
But the one I do resist,

1348
00:56:24,915 --> 00:56:26,109
the one I keep resisting,

1349
00:56:26,183 --> 00:56:27,878
is when they look at an
old guy, and they say,

1350
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:28,815
look at him, Dan,

1351
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:32,582
he's 90 years young.

1352
00:56:32,656 --> 00:56:35,124
Imagine the fear of
aging that reveals,

1353
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:37,490
to not even be able
to use the word old

1354
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:38,323
to describe someone,

1355
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:40,056
to have to use an antonym.

1356
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:41,995
And fear of
aging is natural,

1357
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,123
it's universal isn't it.

1358
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,098
We all have that.

1359
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:45,327
No one wants to get old,

1360
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,494
no one wants to die,

1361
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:47,730
but we do.

1362
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:50,864
So we bullshit ourselves.

1363
00:56:50,941 --> 00:56:52,169
I started
bullshitting myself

1364
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,709
when I got to my 40's.

1365
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:55,108
Soon as I was in my 40's

1366
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:57,146
I'd look in the
mirror and I'd say,

1367
00:56:57,214 --> 00:57:02,948
well, I guess
I'm getting older.

1368
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:05,180
Older sounds a little
better than old, doesn't it.

1369
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:08,053
Sounds like it might
even last a little longer.

1370
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:10,491
Bullshit, I'm getting old,

1371
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,686
and it's okay,

1372
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:14,356
because thanks to our fear
of death in this country

1373
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:17,400
I won't have to die.

1374
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:21,870
I'll pass away.

1375
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:33,878
Or I'll expire like a
magazine subscription.

1376
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:34,939
If it happens
in the hospital,

1377
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:37,578
they'll call it
a terminal episode.

1378
00:57:37,654 --> 00:57:38,951
The insurance company
will refer to it

1379
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:41,513
as negative
patient care outcome,

1380
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:43,525
and if it's the
result of malpractice,

1381
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:46,892
they'll say it was a
therapeutic misadventure.

1382
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:47,895
I'm telling you,

1383
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:50,330
some of this language
makes me want to vomit.

1384
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,459
Well, maybe not vomit,

1385
00:57:52,536 --> 00:57:54,094
makes me want to engage

1386
00:57:54,171 --> 00:57:58,938
in an involuntary
personal protein spill.

1387
00:57:59,009 --> 00:58:00,636
Thank you all.

1388
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:21,662
Give me a little
light for Moe.

1389
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:23,892
Moe says hello.
