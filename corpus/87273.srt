00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:33,075
<i>"We danced our youth</i>
<i>in a dreamed-of city</i>

2
00:01:34,778 --> 00:01:35,972
<i>Venice</i>

3
00:01:36,212 --> 00:01:38,612
<i>Paradise proud and pretty</i>

4
00:01:47,957 --> 00:01:51,154
<i>We lived for love and lust and beauty</i>

5
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,727
<i>Pleasure then our only duty</i>

6
00:02:05,642 --> 00:02:08,270
<i>Floating then 'twixt heaven and earth</i>

7
00:02:08,478 --> 00:02:11,140
<i>And drunk on plenty's blessed mirth</i>

8
00:02:23,526 --> 00:02:26,086
<i>We thought ourselves eternal then</i>

9
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:29,093
<i>Our glory sealed by God's own pen</i>

10
00:02:37,173 --> 00:02:39,937
<i>But paradise we found is always frail</i>

11
00:02:42,612 --> 00:02:45,513
<i>Against man's fear will always fail. "</i>

12
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,929
Is anything wrong, Mama?

13
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:07,868
Nothing at all.

14
00:03:26,022 --> 00:03:27,353
I feel faint.

15
00:03:27,724 --> 00:03:29,191
I feel faint.

16
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:32,988
I feel faint.

17
00:03:38,902 --> 00:03:40,096
What are you doing?

18
00:03:40,336 --> 00:03:41,860
Come on, Beatrice.

19
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:45,165
Quick!

20
00:03:50,046 --> 00:03:51,513
Slow down!

21
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:54,874
Veronica!

22
00:04:14,804 --> 00:04:15,429
Look!

23
00:04:15,872 --> 00:04:16,930
Hello!

24
00:04:17,073 --> 00:04:18,097
Your brother!

25
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,070
Hello, Venice!

26
00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:21,910
What if he sees us?

27
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:24,340
He's looking at them, not us.

28
00:04:24,547 --> 00:04:26,811
Hello, Venice!

29
00:04:27,617 --> 00:04:29,141
Did you get my letters?

30
00:04:29,385 --> 00:04:32,354
No? I'm not talking to you anyway.
You broke my heart.

31
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,951
Come on!

32
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,695
Come on!

33
00:04:48,972 --> 00:04:50,462
All this for me?

34
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,012
Oh Olivia

35
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,406
Oh glorious maid

36
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,977
Of virtue spare

37
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:02,174
With bosoms like those who could care?

38
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,446
My rod...

39
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:07,723
...my lady, a hand.

40
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,424
- Come.
- Hardly.

41
00:05:19,435 --> 00:05:21,960
It's Venus, come to bless the Venetians!

42
00:05:38,054 --> 00:05:39,316
You smell like a sewer.

43
00:05:39,522 --> 00:05:43,185
Thank you. That's a fine welcome,
little sister. Look at you.

44
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,087
You might make a wife after all.

45
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:46,659
- Did you see him?
- Who?

46
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,092
Is he handsome?

47
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,201
- He's powerful.
- He is.

48
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:06,572
Welcome home, Marco.

49
00:06:15,892 --> 00:06:17,359
I think I've missed you.

50
00:06:17,827 --> 00:06:19,954
With all the court ladies to amuse you?

51
00:06:20,196 --> 00:06:23,427
Roman women, they can't hold a candle
to the Venetian.

52
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:27,500
Nor can French, Florentine
nor any from Europe to the Levant.

53
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,835
No doubt you've sampled them all.

54
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:32,405
All but idle amusement
until you blossomed.

55
00:06:33,676 --> 00:06:36,144
What keeps a son
from greeting his own parents?

56
00:06:36,412 --> 00:06:38,209
Beauty, I think.

57
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:43,977
You're drenched. Come on,
you'll catch your death.

58
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:52,093
I thought you were going
to miss dinner again.

59
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:55,628
Ladies have better things to do
than poison their minds with books.

60
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:56,560
Such as?

61
00:06:57,066 --> 00:06:59,398
Such as minding their manners.

62
00:06:59,602 --> 00:07:01,570
The butcher said he must be paid.

63
00:07:01,804 --> 00:07:03,499
Sera, do you know when you sail?

64
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:04,900
Next week.

65
00:07:05,074 --> 00:07:06,803
Wish I could sail the high seas.

66
00:07:07,243 --> 00:07:09,404
Veronica, high seas, indeed.

67
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:13,075
She'll never find a husband
if she carries on like a child.

68
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:19,017
How do people marry, Mother?

69
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:21,784
They strike a bargain.

70
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:24,893
What's to bargain over
if you're in love?

71
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:28,391
Marriage is a contract,
not a perpetual tryst.

72
00:07:28,664 --> 00:07:30,723
Have you got someone in mind?

73
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:41,868
- Love poetry?
- Give it back!

74
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,069
"Life's harshness all forgave

75
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,646
Hearts yearning met
When God...

76
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,644
...your soul did..."

77
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:55,920
Must be true love.

78
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,121
I'd have made a dashing courtier.

79
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:06,033
Or maybe a pirate!

80
00:08:08,204 --> 00:08:08,966
Disengage.

81
00:08:09,305 --> 00:08:12,502
And again, back.
Back, extend and lunge.

82
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,839
<i>Nor in hope</i>

83
00:08:20,716 --> 00:08:23,116
<i>The world can show a fatal...</i>

84
00:08:23,386 --> 00:08:25,354
<i>... love for me</i>

85
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,613
<i>But since that I must...</i>

86
00:08:27,857 --> 00:08:32,157
<i>I really love you</i>
<i>Please won't you love me</i>

87
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,642
And where might you be going?

88
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,107
Nowhere.

89
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,481
That 'nowhere' has a nice tenor.

90
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,728
Veronica is on the canal
with Marco Venier. Alone.

91
00:09:14,737 --> 00:09:16,329
Mother Franco!

92
00:09:16,572 --> 00:09:20,338
Elena, don't call me that.
Makes me feel ancient.

93
00:09:20,576 --> 00:09:23,841
Young ladies of marriageable age
must be chaperoned.

94
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,174
A good marriage for Veronica
could win me a proper commission.

95
00:09:27,383 --> 00:09:28,645
I always liked Marco.

96
00:09:28,918 --> 00:09:30,715
He won't marry her
if he's had her.

97
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,412
Marry her? A bride of Marco's
will need a king's ransom.

98
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:42,386
"I see my fated stars
Your eyes...

99
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:46,360
They melt me as the sun does snow"

100
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,005
I bought this in Rome for you.

101
00:09:57,613 --> 00:09:58,944
You didn't buy it for me.

102
00:09:59,148 --> 00:10:00,206
Yes, I did.

103
00:10:00,549 --> 00:10:01,641
I just didn't know it.

104
00:10:06,222 --> 00:10:09,020
Such an easy gift might easily
be taken back again.

105
00:10:11,727 --> 00:10:13,695
Then name me any other gift.

106
00:10:15,097 --> 00:10:16,758
The book will do for now.

107
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:20,261
I think perhaps you're too young...

108
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,364
...to accept what I would...

109
00:10:22,605 --> 00:10:23,765
...truly give you.

110
00:10:24,774 --> 00:10:28,642
I am not so young
as you are vain.

111
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:31,971
You haven't changed, have you?

112
00:10:33,783 --> 00:10:34,977
How would you know?

113
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:52,360
I fear you mistake me for
one of your easy court companions.

114
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,004
I mistook the asking in your eyes.

115
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:17,548
Do you not like my kiss?

116
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,526
I wish it were not a sin
to have liked it so.

117
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,695
God made sin...

118
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,460
...that we might know His mercy.

119
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:03,129
<i>I find myself within his eyes</i>

120
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,831
<i>I long for more of myself to know</i>

121
00:12:07,743 --> 00:12:10,177
<i>He hears, it seems, my silent cries</i>

122
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,508
<i>And makes my heart my reason's foe</i>

123
00:12:15,117 --> 00:12:18,086
<i>How can this be, to love so quickly?</i>

124
00:12:18,721 --> 00:12:21,155
<i>"Love does not wait," is his reply</i>

125
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:24,952
<i>What magic weaves</i>
<i>his touch to trick me?</i>

126
00:12:26,362 --> 00:12:28,853
<i>How can I now my love deny?</i>

127
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,508
For my bride...

128
00:12:40,743 --> 00:12:43,473
...a little wedding trinket.

129
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:59,521
Lorenzo Gritti and his fair bride

130
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:02,557
Your union gives us greatest pride

131
00:13:03,232 --> 00:13:06,565
Good health, great wealth
and lasting line

132
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,749
- How could they?
- How could who what?

133
00:13:25,921 --> 00:13:29,186
Your parents marry your sister off
to that piece of decaying flesh.

134
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:34,158
That piece of decaying flesh is a cousin
of the doge, confidant of the pope.

135
00:13:34,363 --> 00:13:37,662
- The Roman court adores him.
- They don't have to sleep with him.

136
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,162
You'd be surprised.

137
00:13:39,368 --> 00:13:44,271
Save your blushes. They don't sit well
with the bluntness of your tongue.

138
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:49,176
Surely they could have traded down
a few ducats for an ounce of virility.

139
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,906
- Why?
- For your sister's sake.

140
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,047
She's a prude.

141
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,615
Then it would hardly have been
more cruel marrying her to God.

142
00:13:55,851 --> 00:13:58,285
God isn't as rich as Lorenzo Gritti.

143
00:14:04,793 --> 00:14:08,160
Do honor to the houses
of Gritti and Venier.

144
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,064
For Venice.

145
00:14:34,557 --> 00:14:38,186
I've seen how you look at her,
how she looks at you. I know that look.

146
00:14:38,827 --> 00:14:41,660
Do not underestimate
love's allure, Marco.

147
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,194
Enjoy it...

148
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,393
...but guard your head and your heart.

149
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,070
You cannot marry her.

150
00:14:50,606 --> 00:14:51,732
I know.

151
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:55,069
Pietro, come.

152
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:15,488
I wish that were our bridal chamber.

153
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,769
You think me terribly wicked
for saying that?

154
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,181
You know we can't marry.

155
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,123
I know only what you tell me.

156
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,021
I must marry...

157
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:50,190
...according to my station
and my family's wealth.

158
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,229
Then why are you here?

159
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,032
Because I could not stay away.

160
00:15:57,306 --> 00:15:58,671
Then don't.

161
00:16:02,144 --> 00:16:05,602
My marriage must be a marriage of state.

162
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:12,082
My people are true citizens
700 years back.

163
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:15,355
A coat of arms does not
an inheritance make.

164
00:16:16,925 --> 00:16:18,859
I speak of love and you talk of money.

165
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,028
Of my duty.

166
00:16:20,262 --> 00:16:21,286
And your heart?

167
00:16:21,997 --> 00:16:24,591
This isn't about my heart,
it's about politics.

168
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,437
How romantic.

169
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:35,509
Marriage isn't romantic.
That's why God invented poetry.

170
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:37,542
To sweeten men's lying lips!

171
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,078
If I were a liar,
would I tell you this now?

172
00:16:40,282 --> 00:16:42,773
If you cared for me,
you could not tell me this ever.

173
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:46,254
I want you.

174
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:52,083
Not enough.

175
00:17:11,313 --> 00:17:13,577
Daughter, you have reached too high.

176
00:17:14,316 --> 00:17:16,910
I told you, marriage is a contract.

177
00:17:19,488 --> 00:17:23,254
To a man of Marco's station,
it has nothing to do with love.

178
00:17:25,327 --> 00:17:27,591
But you can still have Marco.

179
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:33,428
But not in wedlock.

180
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:41,440
There's an alternative to marriage.

181
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:45,779
You'll become a courtesan.

182
00:17:49,451 --> 00:17:53,353
I've seen you watching them.
I've seen you mesmerized by them.

183
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,184
You'll become a courtesan...

184
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:02,323
...like your mother used to be.

185
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,641
You were a courtesan?

186
00:18:15,644 --> 00:18:16,906
One of the best.

187
00:18:20,749 --> 00:18:21,477
When?

188
00:18:22,718 --> 00:18:24,185
A long time ago.

189
00:18:27,389 --> 00:18:31,052
I had hoped to buy you a good marriage.

190
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,118
But your father...

191
00:18:33,662 --> 00:18:35,687
...drank away your dowry.

192
00:18:36,064 --> 00:18:37,827
Your brother must buy his posting.

193
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:39,996
And I am too old.

194
00:18:40,969 --> 00:18:41,765
It is you...

195
00:18:42,337 --> 00:18:44,396
...who must support us now.

196
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:47,967
Look at these hands.

197
00:18:48,644 --> 00:18:49,872
Soft.

198
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:52,505
Too soft...

199
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,306
...for a scullery maid...

200
00:18:54,516 --> 00:18:56,245
...or working the winery.

201
00:18:56,652 --> 00:18:58,517
Perhaps a lady's maid.

202
00:19:01,423 --> 00:19:04,688
- Wouldn't that be funny?
- Send me to the convent then!

203
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,360
You are not the type.

204
00:19:06,595 --> 00:19:08,028
How would you know?

205
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:13,968
What're you doing?

206
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:18,399
Whichever devil you choose,
you'll look him in the eye first...

207
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:20,575
...which is more than my mother gave me.

208
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:03,315
First secret of all great courtesans:

209
00:20:04,653 --> 00:20:06,621
You must know pleasure...

210
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:08,379
...to give pleasure.

211
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:12,591
Beauty is a manifestation of the divine.

212
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:16,230
That theory built the Sistine Chapel,
and it'll do the same for you.

213
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,368
Height is an advantage to women
as well as men.

214
00:20:22,004 --> 00:20:24,302
Carriage creates the first impression.

215
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,304
Come with me, Veronica.

216
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,478
Mother, we can't go in there.

217
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,442
Ladies can't go in there.

218
00:21:40,415 --> 00:21:42,042
Courtesans can.

219
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:56,656
The emperor Pericles relied
more for policy on his mistress...

220
00:21:56,865 --> 00:21:59,095
...than he ever did on his lieutenants.

221
00:21:59,768 --> 00:22:04,068
Courtesans, my dear, are the
most educated women in the world.

222
00:22:35,203 --> 00:22:38,570
<i>A courtesan is a force of nature</i>
<i>in a civilized cloak.</i>

223
00:22:38,874 --> 00:22:41,604
<i>Any chambermaid can flop down,</i>
<i>take off her shirt...</i>

224
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:42,936
<i>... and men will come.</i>

225
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:47,480
Your true power comes from
something much deeper than beauty.

226
00:22:48,383 --> 00:22:49,782
Cleopatra knew that.

227
00:22:50,252 --> 00:22:51,514
Theodosia.

228
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,814
Aspasia.
She could seduce a man at 20 paces...

229
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,356
...without revealing an inch of flesh.

230
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,324
How?

231
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,993
With her mind.

232
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,120
Desire begins in the mind.

233
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:05,966
I don't understand.

234
00:23:07,702 --> 00:23:08,669
No, you don't.

235
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,666
Think of Marco.

236
00:23:15,844 --> 00:23:17,471
I know you know anger.

237
00:23:19,781 --> 00:23:21,009
Try disdain.

238
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:29,757
Amusement.

239
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,797
Submission.

240
00:23:43,805 --> 00:23:44,772
Rapture.

241
00:23:57,052 --> 00:23:58,019
Now...

242
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:03,179
...make him believe that he is
the only man in the universe.

243
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,405
Who taught you?

244
00:24:24,913 --> 00:24:26,312
Your grandmother.

245
00:24:33,688 --> 00:24:37,124
In order to choose your lovers wisely,
you need to understand men.

246
00:24:38,994 --> 00:24:41,224
No matter their shape or size...

247
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:43,964
...position or wealth...

248
00:24:45,867 --> 00:24:46,993
...they all dream...

249
00:24:47,202 --> 00:24:48,533
...of the temptress.

250
00:24:51,706 --> 00:24:53,037
The irresistible...

251
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:55,539
...unapproachable Venus...

252
00:24:56,545 --> 00:24:59,912
...who quickly turns pliable maiden
when they've had a hard day.

253
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:51,933
Come.

254
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,930
You can't be squeamish.

255
00:25:56,771 --> 00:25:58,500
If you don't enjoy it...

256
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,670
...they'll smell it,
like a dog smells fear.

257
00:26:02,777 --> 00:26:04,506
And they'll hate you for it.

258
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,314
What's there to be squeamish about?

259
00:26:19,628 --> 00:26:20,925
If you touch...

260
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,254
...here.

261
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,400
Amazing.

262
00:26:27,636 --> 00:26:29,035
Use your fingers lightly...

263
00:26:29,237 --> 00:26:30,704
...like feathers.

264
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,938
Your tongue, like licking sweets.

265
00:26:36,645 --> 00:26:38,613
Your teeth, with restraint.

266
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,876
Just enough...

267
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,319
...to keep him wanting more.

268
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,488
It's wanting...

269
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,718
...that keeps us alive.

270
00:27:56,725 --> 00:27:58,352
Minister Ramberti.

271
00:27:59,027 --> 00:28:01,757
I'd like to present you
to my daughter, Veronica.

272
00:28:03,531 --> 00:28:05,931
It would bring me luck if you'd
play a hand for me.

273
00:28:08,803 --> 00:28:11,397
Remember, Veronica, love love.

274
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:14,164
But do not love the man,
or you'll be in his power.

275
00:28:14,376 --> 00:28:15,741
Good luck.

276
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,773
May I call?

277
00:28:24,552 --> 00:28:26,019
May I call?

278
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,222
Lovely.

279
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,731
This is my first bet.

280
00:28:44,906 --> 00:28:46,430
Your first?

281
00:28:47,242 --> 00:28:49,142
Unmistakably.

282
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,310
I'm honored.

283
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,984
Repent your empty excesses!

284
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,285
There is no comfort here.

285
00:29:09,697 --> 00:29:10,823
Friends.

286
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,627
May I ask you, is this God's game?

287
00:29:13,868 --> 00:29:15,836
Why do you gamble with your souls?

288
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,335
What is it you want?

289
00:29:17,705 --> 00:29:19,263
Your salvation.

290
00:29:21,276 --> 00:29:23,437
This is no company for one so fair.

291
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:46,926
Venice may as well be deemed
one large floating brothel.

292
00:29:47,135 --> 00:29:50,104
What's biting your ass
this fair evening, cousin?

293
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,998
You'd begrudge the fairer sex
their little crumbs?

294
00:29:56,478 --> 00:30:00,312
No, though they do make more
in a night than I a month.

295
00:30:00,748 --> 00:30:02,875
Go make yourself useful.
Give us a rhyme.

296
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,611
I'm no performing monkey
for the idle masses.

297
00:30:05,854 --> 00:30:07,151
Since when?

298
00:30:07,355 --> 00:30:10,222
We're all of us
performing monkeys, nephew.

299
00:30:10,592 --> 00:30:12,059
Paupers and poets alike.

300
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:15,919
I'm at your service, Uncle.

301
00:30:16,531 --> 00:30:18,863
If it's rhyme you wish,
I'll gladly oblige.

302
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,199
A subject?

303
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:24,699
Doge?

304
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:30,371
Venice. To celebrate our plenty.

305
00:30:33,181 --> 00:30:34,876
Born in glory

306
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:38,078
The virgin's exultation

307
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,913
Fair and mighty Venice

308
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,548
Queen of the sea

309
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,892
Unconquered maid

310
00:30:45,193 --> 00:30:47,423
Sovereign isle is she

311
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,329
Chaste goddess

312
00:30:54,536 --> 00:30:57,096
Rising from the foamy depths

313
00:30:59,908 --> 00:31:00,875
Wine?

314
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,269
Please.

315
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:28,061
<i>Signor</i> Venier? Don't be absurd.

316
00:31:28,403 --> 00:31:30,234
I'm not being absurd.
I'm just...

317
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,905
...treating you with indifference,
as you did me.

318
00:31:33,074 --> 00:31:35,907
You confuse indifference with honesty.

319
00:31:36,077 --> 00:31:37,908
You confuse honesty with venality.

320
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:40,047
You think me venal?

321
00:31:40,381 --> 00:31:42,576
You are a venal cur.

322
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,747
Hello, Marco.

323
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:47,581
Something I can do for you?

324
00:31:58,766 --> 00:32:02,224
Here, beauty, wit and wealth combined

325
00:32:03,938 --> 00:32:06,429
Gateway 'twixt distant East and West

326
00:32:06,874 --> 00:32:08,307
Mother of liberty

327
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:09,635
Child of honor

328
00:32:09,877 --> 00:32:12,471
Home and hearth and heart

329
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,114
To men of valor

330
00:32:26,427 --> 00:32:29,590
Perhaps the fair maiden can do better.

331
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,172
A duel!

332
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:05,997
Venice...

333
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,659
...mother...

334
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,567
...virgin, queen and...

335
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:12,499
...goddess

336
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:17,043
To be all 5 at once is no mean trick.

337
00:33:19,447 --> 00:33:22,883
If women's lust lost Eden
Our redress to be

338
00:33:23,551 --> 00:33:27,282
Hearth, heart and home to every...

339
00:33:28,623 --> 00:33:29,351
...prick.

340
00:33:33,961 --> 00:33:34,825
Who is she?

341
00:33:42,136 --> 00:33:43,603
Sweet lagoon

342
00:33:44,405 --> 00:33:46,134
That brings us...

343
00:33:46,474 --> 00:33:47,907
...Iovely life

344
00:33:54,749 --> 00:33:56,478
Rank with...

345
00:33:56,818 --> 00:33:59,446
...greed and trade's...

346
00:34:01,422 --> 00:34:03,083
...devouring strife

347
00:34:14,702 --> 00:34:16,135
Lady Venice

348
00:34:20,108 --> 00:34:22,542
Her raiment, as the moon doth glow

349
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,646
Her wisdom

350
00:34:26,848 --> 00:34:30,113
Her wisdom shines bright
As envious day

351
00:34:31,452 --> 00:34:33,352
Her wives...

352
00:34:33,788 --> 00:34:35,312
...like booty...

353
00:34:36,524 --> 00:34:38,355
...are locked away

354
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:13,720
Never ever hide that face again.

355
00:36:52,927 --> 00:36:54,622
Children are a deficit.

356
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,457
It's not infallible.

357
00:36:57,665 --> 00:36:59,963
It's more comfortable
than a turtle shell.

358
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,408
So?

359
00:37:12,446 --> 00:37:14,505
You didn't tell me everything.

360
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:16,848
How could I?

361
00:37:23,925 --> 00:37:25,893
They won't all be Rambertis.

362
00:37:32,867 --> 00:37:34,334
Who's next?

363
00:37:59,126 --> 00:38:01,560
Honor us with a poem, <i>Signora</i> Veronica.

364
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:05,363
I would be too humbled
before such eloquent minds.

365
00:38:05,566 --> 00:38:07,534
Make us laugh as you did before.

366
00:38:07,735 --> 00:38:10,761
Perhaps if I'm clever
next time I shall make you weep.

367
00:38:10,972 --> 00:38:13,736
I shall weep if I don't
see you again.

368
00:38:14,241 --> 00:38:15,503
Thursday?

369
00:38:15,977 --> 00:38:17,342
Every Thursday?

370
00:38:17,678 --> 00:38:19,908
I shall count the hours in between.

371
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:25,416
Scrape any lower
you can have shoes for earrings.

372
00:38:26,253 --> 00:38:29,689
Why, Marco Venier,
I do believe you're jealous.

373
00:38:29,924 --> 00:38:32,119
I can only be jealous
of what I cannot have.

374
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,796
- And you cannot have me.
- There's no one in Venice I can't have.

375
00:38:35,997 --> 00:38:38,932
And there's not a man in Venice
that I can't have.

376
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,598
We are so alike, you and me.

377
00:38:42,169 --> 00:38:46,367
We both know that love is inconvenient,
if not impossible.

378
00:38:47,441 --> 00:38:51,605
So why not enjoy what little
we're allowed together?

379
00:38:57,618 --> 00:38:59,552
I'm all booked up.

380
00:39:11,032 --> 00:39:11,999
Well?

381
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,424
Well, what?

382
00:39:21,976 --> 00:39:23,739
I see you're enjoying yourself.

383
00:39:23,911 --> 00:39:25,503
Yes, thank you, <i>Signor</i> Venier.

384
00:39:25,746 --> 00:39:26,713
Domenico.

385
00:39:26,914 --> 00:39:29,109
Otherwise, you'll make me feel old.

386
00:39:29,417 --> 00:39:31,044
Let me help you.

387
00:39:32,053 --> 00:39:34,544
It's not a sight
for such beautiful eyes.

388
00:39:34,755 --> 00:39:36,655
I'm not afraid of flesh.

389
00:40:05,786 --> 00:40:07,185
The man who bid you rhyme...

390
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,650
...Francesco Martenengo...

391
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:13,059
...admiral of our fleet.

392
00:40:16,764 --> 00:40:19,255
Whatever you do, don't make him mad.

393
00:40:19,934 --> 00:40:21,458
Bishop De La Torre.

394
00:40:21,702 --> 00:40:25,934
His collection of paintings is surpassed
only by his collection of women.

395
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:27,800
So many?

396
00:40:27,975 --> 00:40:29,237
Biblical.

397
00:40:31,078 --> 00:40:32,102
Ramberti, you know.

398
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,641
Minister of Defense.
I tell you, he's in love with you.

399
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,614
You say that as if
you thought it a disease.

400
00:40:40,087 --> 00:40:42,647
You think, perhaps,
I want you for myself?

401
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,215
I would not presume.

402
00:40:45,626 --> 00:40:46,650
Pity.

403
00:40:46,994 --> 00:40:49,827
I was flattered to think
you might harbor such suspicions...

404
00:40:49,997 --> 00:40:51,965
...under the circumstances.

405
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:55,033
I would be happy to attend to you
under any circumstances.

406
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:29,131
"All the best courtesans have one."

407
00:41:29,837 --> 00:41:32,965
<i>Signor</i> Marco Venier
wishes your audience.

408
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:48,153
A peacock does not an inheritance make.

409
00:42:14,915 --> 00:42:18,180
Look at these gowns.
Each is a unique work of art.

410
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,138
Charming spectacle.

411
00:43:13,073 --> 00:43:14,267
I've seen better.

412
00:43:15,242 --> 00:43:16,573
Must be interesting...

413
00:43:16,777 --> 00:43:20,110
...being in a room full of men, most of
whom you've seen naked.

414
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,616
Puts it all in some kind of perspective.

415
00:43:26,987 --> 00:43:28,579
I was wondering...

416
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:32,857
I would enjoy it if perhaps we might...

417
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,991
...exchange verse again...

418
00:43:35,496 --> 00:43:36,360
...some night.

419
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,905
We can't afford one another, Maffio.
We're both...

420
00:43:51,111 --> 00:43:53,409
...courtiers singing for our supper.

421
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:56,816
Of course.

422
00:44:17,971 --> 00:44:19,871
What was Cousin Maffio on about?

423
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,099
The pleasures of poetry.

424
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:24,904
Enjoy the hunt?

425
00:44:25,979 --> 00:44:29,676
The hunt possesses,
doesn't it, such a cruel beauty?

426
00:44:29,883 --> 00:44:31,475
Much like your own.

427
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:33,718
Is my beauty cruel?

428
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,718
I think so.

429
00:44:37,157 --> 00:44:39,625
To those that you refuse, yes.

430
00:44:40,227 --> 00:44:43,060
It is only my refusal
that arouses your longing.

431
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:44,321
You underrate yourself.

432
00:44:44,565 --> 00:44:45,691
Flatterer.

433
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,298
Put it to the test.

434
00:44:47,501 --> 00:44:48,729
Say yes...

435
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,904
...and then see if you're rid of me.

436
00:44:51,338 --> 00:44:52,999
Let's see.

437
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,240
If I'm right...

438
00:44:55,876 --> 00:44:58,902
...you'll tire of me,
and if you're right, I'll tire of you.

439
00:45:02,716 --> 00:45:05,150
Maybe we should just stay as we are.

440
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:11,353
You know I do regret...

441
00:45:13,193 --> 00:45:15,252
...the hurt that I caused you.

442
00:45:20,534 --> 00:45:22,058
With all my heart.

443
00:45:30,277 --> 00:45:31,676
The heart is higher up.

444
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,280
Her father owns half of Lombardy...

445
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:45,424
...and her aunt is the pope's niece. An
alliance with this family is a godsend.

446
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,824
You will marry Giulia da Lezze...

447
00:45:50,397 --> 00:45:53,059
...for Venice, if for no other reason.

448
00:46:04,077 --> 00:46:07,046
You have the feigned indifference
of a man in love.

449
00:46:11,084 --> 00:46:12,312
Go on, son...

450
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:15,354
...tell the truth and shame the devil.

451
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,130
The Turks are on the move again?

452
00:46:28,335 --> 00:46:31,395
The sultan wants the Mediterranean
for his bathing pool.

453
00:46:31,939 --> 00:46:34,806
So what is that heavenly thing?

454
00:46:36,109 --> 00:46:37,440
Ermine.

455
00:46:49,823 --> 00:46:51,518
I'm an ass!

456
00:46:55,696 --> 00:46:57,527
My little poetess.

457
00:46:57,764 --> 00:46:59,425
I'm an ass!

458
00:46:59,633 --> 00:47:00,930
You are the brightest...

459
00:47:01,368 --> 00:47:04,963
...star in the Venetian firmament.

460
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,204
Excuse me.

461
00:47:08,709 --> 00:47:10,006
The coldest.

462
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:11,177
Cold.

463
00:47:11,378 --> 00:47:12,709
But also the brightest.

464
00:47:16,049 --> 00:47:17,607
My uncle...

465
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:19,979
...tells me...

466
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,844
...I have...

467
00:47:22,055 --> 00:47:25,252
...the feigned indifference of a man...

468
00:47:36,236 --> 00:47:37,999
Of a man about to be married.

469
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,672
I'm getting married. Congratulate me.

470
00:47:49,182 --> 00:47:51,673
Felicitations on your grand match.

471
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,083
Generously put.

472
00:47:56,757 --> 00:47:57,883
Do you love her?

473
00:47:58,926 --> 00:48:00,086
Do I have to?

474
00:48:05,532 --> 00:48:07,591
I hope it's a profitable union.

475
00:48:59,653 --> 00:49:01,120
Do you like poetry?

476
00:49:02,589 --> 00:49:04,318
I know the Psalms.

477
00:49:09,596 --> 00:49:11,063
Tell me a secret.

478
00:49:13,834 --> 00:49:16,928
- I have no secrets.
- Everyone has secrets.

479
00:49:22,609 --> 00:49:24,577
Tell me a desire.

480
00:49:26,446 --> 00:49:27,913
Deep desire.

481
00:49:32,786 --> 00:49:34,981
I hope to give you many strong sons.

482
00:49:35,188 --> 00:49:37,520
No, I mean something...

483
00:49:40,293 --> 00:49:41,521
...for you.

484
00:49:42,362 --> 00:49:44,125
Something just for you.

485
00:49:50,537 --> 00:49:53,472
To be a good wife to you
is my only desire.

486
00:50:05,152 --> 00:50:08,713
<i>'Tis not wanton flesh</i>
<i>But love that brings me shame</i>

487
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,621
<i>Mocked by fate</i>
<i>Imprisoned by my womb</i>

488
00:50:15,362 --> 00:50:19,025
My jealousy possessed
Which slow consumes

489
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:22,360
An ice-cold, gloomy vicious flame

490
00:50:24,037 --> 00:50:26,665
I love the very weapons which me wound

491
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,327
Lucky is the man
that can inspire your poet's heart.

492
00:50:50,564 --> 00:50:52,759
The only form she's mastered
is a whore's.

493
00:50:56,136 --> 00:51:00,300
Honestly, I didn't think Uncle
was still capable of getting it up.

494
00:51:02,943 --> 00:51:06,674
What did you do to him, to get him
to publish this little pile of ditties?

495
00:51:08,081 --> 00:51:10,811
Won't give the time of day
to his own flesh and blood.

496
00:51:11,418 --> 00:51:13,147
She worked for it.

497
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,952
I'll bet she worked for it.

498
00:51:17,724 --> 00:51:19,248
What do you cost these days?

499
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:25,025
If your prick is as limp as your verse,
no price could purchase time enough.

500
00:51:37,144 --> 00:51:38,907
Just making a point, Cousin.

501
00:51:39,112 --> 00:51:40,909
Very brave.
What point would that be?

502
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:43,148
I'm sorry.

503
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:44,347
I'm sorry.

504
00:51:46,787 --> 00:51:48,516
I apologize.

505
00:52:16,817 --> 00:52:21,311
Have you the guts to try again
Blade to blade and pen to pen?

506
00:52:26,026 --> 00:52:27,823
Madonna Veronica.

507
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,331
Veritably unique whore

508
00:52:37,671 --> 00:52:39,400
May sing...

509
00:52:39,706 --> 00:52:41,139
...and rhyme...

510
00:52:41,341 --> 00:52:42,467
...and more

511
00:52:43,176 --> 00:52:44,302
Still...

512
00:52:44,978 --> 00:52:46,878
...is at best a slut

513
00:52:47,047 --> 00:52:49,777
With every horny mutt

514
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,422
You pride yourself on arts and letters

515
00:52:58,124 --> 00:52:59,955
And fucking best your manly betters

516
00:53:04,364 --> 00:53:09,301
I save the goodly wives of Venice
From their husbands' lustful menace

517
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:20,246
Then you confess...

518
00:53:21,081 --> 00:53:22,776
...you love...

519
00:53:24,885 --> 00:53:25,783
...to rut

520
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:29,410
And your beauty's gladly stuck

521
00:53:40,233 --> 00:53:41,700
Little mistake.

522
00:53:58,051 --> 00:53:59,416
I confess...

523
00:53:59,619 --> 00:54:01,587
...I fuck divinely

524
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:04,585
Those who love and well opine me

525
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,849
I confess...

526
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:09,028
...I fuck divinely

527
00:54:09,262 --> 00:54:10,661
Those who...

528
00:54:11,131 --> 00:54:12,962
...richly wine and dine me

529
00:54:25,979 --> 00:54:30,075
On the page or on the sheet
You'll never find a tongue more sweet

530
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:33,118
On the page or on the sheet

531
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:38,783
On the page or on the sheet
Greet bleat...

532
00:54:38,992 --> 00:54:42,928
On the page or on the sheet
A greater hack you'll never meet.

533
00:54:50,937 --> 00:54:52,234
You fight like a sailor.

534
00:54:52,439 --> 00:54:55,135
I learned from a sailor.
Now stop stalling.

535
00:55:00,814 --> 00:55:03,544
Recant the curse you give my kind

536
00:55:04,017 --> 00:55:07,077
Admit I have, as you, a heart and mind

537
00:55:07,654 --> 00:55:11,112
A greedy hand, an empty heart
Is all that wrests your legs apart

538
00:58:59,886 --> 00:59:03,686
How did you let this paragon of cities
turn into a cesspit...

539
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:05,721
...of vice and depravity?

540
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:09,789
For as the waters flow
through Venice every day...

541
00:59:10,096 --> 00:59:12,257
...and wash away the filth...

542
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:22,173
Do you not agree?

543
00:59:23,376 --> 00:59:25,105
I think not.

544
00:59:25,378 --> 00:59:28,575
A soul in torment is a soul without God.

545
00:59:29,282 --> 00:59:31,750
All flesh is grass.

546
00:59:32,585 --> 00:59:34,246
We must all meet our Maker.

547
00:59:34,454 --> 00:59:36,615
To this end we must all come.

548
00:59:36,856 --> 00:59:38,915
Even Venetians.

549
00:59:42,128 --> 00:59:44,392
You can be saved, my brother.

550
00:59:49,469 --> 00:59:50,629
You can...

551
00:59:51,304 --> 00:59:53,363
...cure me of my desire...

552
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:55,732
...young idealist?

553
00:59:56,309 --> 00:59:57,367
No.

554
00:59:57,977 --> 00:59:59,410
I can't.

555
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,413
Tonight's too many hours away.

556
01:00:22,335 --> 01:00:24,826
My affections aren't mine
to give you tonight.

557
01:00:25,438 --> 01:00:26,405
What?

558
01:00:28,341 --> 01:00:30,138
I have mouths to feed like you.

559
01:00:31,644 --> 01:00:32,668
I'll support you.

560
01:00:35,114 --> 01:00:37,344
No. There will no money between us.

561
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:40,347
So you'd continue with this life?

562
01:00:40,653 --> 01:00:43,918
I have no choice.
This is the life I was given.

563
01:00:46,359 --> 01:00:47,883
You do have a choice.

564
01:00:48,127 --> 01:00:50,322
If I were yours alone, your property...

565
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:51,792
...you'd soon tire of me.

566
01:00:51,964 --> 01:00:52,862
You're wrong.

567
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:54,393
Am I?

568
01:00:55,368 --> 01:00:58,633
If you cared for me,
you could not do this.

569
01:00:58,838 --> 01:01:00,806
Do not ask of me what you cannot give.

570
01:01:02,675 --> 01:01:04,643
Your wife is waiting.

571
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:14,681
What ails you, Marco?

572
01:01:22,362 --> 01:01:23,294
What do you mean?

573
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:42,179
I want to be a good wife.

574
01:01:49,422 --> 01:01:51,356
Impending deprivation...

575
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:54,085
...always makes me hungry.

576
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,190
My dear...

577
01:01:57,830 --> 01:01:59,263
...you're not eating.

578
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,868
But you are though, darling.

579
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:08,498
There'll be no more of these little
delicacies if the sultan turns nasty.

580
01:02:15,548 --> 01:02:18,381
Why are bells ringing
at this time of night?

581
01:02:24,724 --> 01:02:26,157
The sultan has attacked.

582
01:02:26,392 --> 01:02:28,883
He took 8 ships near Malta.

583
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:35,362
If we don't sail for Cyprus by Easter,
we won't be sailing back.

584
01:02:35,568 --> 01:02:38,969
- Sooner, I think.
- If we can't rally France, we won't.

585
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,003
The Turks have 3 ships to our 1.

586
01:02:41,207 --> 01:02:43,869
- Will the King of France help us?
- If we amuse him.

587
01:02:44,043 --> 01:02:46,307
King Henry's a boy in men's breeches.

588
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:48,912
- A powerful boy.
- A boy nonetheless.

589
01:02:49,081 --> 01:02:52,414
He commands a lot of ships
and has no love for the Turks.

590
01:02:59,425 --> 01:03:01,893
Your wife believes
she has bewitched you.

591
01:03:02,261 --> 01:03:04,491
What's the harm in bewitching
a married man?

592
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:08,166
That man has to have heirs.
He's to be a senator soon.

593
01:03:08,634 --> 01:03:09,601
So he shall.

594
01:03:12,905 --> 01:03:15,601
What God and greed
have joined together...

595
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:19,511
...let no love put asunder.

596
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:29,918
The woman you love is not good...

597
01:03:30,957 --> 01:03:32,925
...not pure, not meek.

598
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:36,219
I'm a courtesan. It's the only thing
you'll let me do...

599
01:03:36,462 --> 01:03:38,191
I can't bear it.

600
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:40,365
I know I have no right...

601
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:42,534
...but I won't share you.

602
01:03:42,768 --> 01:03:45,566
But I must share you. I must bear that.
I have no choice.

603
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:49,132
Please don't envy Giulia.
She will never have what you have.

604
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:52,638
Please trust me.

605
01:03:55,481 --> 01:03:57,039
I don't know how.

606
01:03:57,283 --> 01:03:59,251
I'll earn your trust.

607
01:03:59,785 --> 01:04:00,581
Let me.

608
01:04:03,155 --> 01:04:04,588
You'll go to war and die.

609
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:14,297
Stay with me for as long as we have.

610
01:04:15,868 --> 01:04:18,234
And be your private whore?

611
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:20,098
Don't ever say that.

612
01:04:22,008 --> 01:04:23,873
You're Veronica Franco.

613
01:04:25,678 --> 01:04:27,111
You're a poet.

614
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:30,544
And you're my lady.

615
01:04:44,363 --> 01:04:46,160
Cancel my appointments, please.

616
01:04:51,904 --> 01:04:54,464
It's a treacherous game you play,
my little idiot.

617
01:04:57,043 --> 01:04:58,977
You outdid me long ago.

618
01:04:59,378 --> 01:05:00,709
I know that.

619
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,607
And the irony is, it's not because...

620
01:05:04,216 --> 01:05:07,049
...you're prettier than I was,
because you're not.

621
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:10,182
Nor that you're a better lay,
because you aren't.

622
01:05:10,723 --> 01:05:13,385
It's because you're smarter.
You have a gift.

623
01:05:13,593 --> 01:05:17,154
- Don't throw it away.
- For God's sake, haven't I done enough?

624
01:05:17,396 --> 01:05:19,887
He's a client like the others.
Love him and lose.

625
01:06:40,646 --> 01:06:42,614
I must go. King Henry's coming.

626
01:06:44,617 --> 01:06:46,244
I'll get my things.

627
01:07:14,213 --> 01:07:16,647
You've been selfish,
keeping her hidden away.

628
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:19,242
You came back in time...

629
01:07:19,485 --> 01:07:21,919
...to seduce the French king.
He arrives tomorrow.

630
01:07:22,154 --> 01:07:23,917
He'd let Paris burn for a good lay.

631
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:25,522
He'll hardly fight for Venice.

632
01:07:25,725 --> 01:07:27,818
Depends on how Venice lays him.

633
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:30,790
I don't mind fighting,
but I prefer a war I can win.

634
01:07:30,996 --> 01:07:33,624
Without France's ships,
it's a suicide mission.

635
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:03,090
Glorious architecture.

636
01:08:24,717 --> 01:08:25,809
Good Henry!

637
01:08:26,051 --> 01:08:28,451
We must fight the infidels here...

638
01:08:28,654 --> 01:08:31,589
...before we can beat them abroad!
Before we can fight them at home!

639
01:08:32,491 --> 01:08:34,391
Take this paper to the king!

640
01:08:34,593 --> 01:08:38,222
Let me go! I'm a man of God!
Give him this paper!

641
01:08:39,565 --> 01:08:43,228
France has zealots too. We prefer
heretics. They're not so serious.

642
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:46,599
Zealots are creating
difficulties everywhere.

643
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:02,717
Our captains tell us...

644
01:09:02,922 --> 01:09:05,447
...the Muslim Turks have been
spotted near Cyprus.

645
01:09:07,259 --> 01:09:09,227
Rather presumptuous, don't you think?

646
01:09:10,262 --> 01:09:14,596
Rather presumptuous to think
the Church wouldn't come to its defense?

647
01:09:16,702 --> 01:09:19,330
What about these courtesans
Venice is so famous for?

648
01:09:22,441 --> 01:09:24,739
The sultan is too experienced
to gamble...

649
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:26,036
I'd like to meet them.

650
01:09:29,281 --> 01:09:30,248
Are they nearby?

651
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:12,147
Who's that? She's not with the others.

652
01:10:12,825 --> 01:10:16,488
Veronica Franco, Your Excellency.
The poetess.

653
01:10:17,329 --> 01:10:18,796
Is she a courtesan?

654
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:21,957
She is, Your Highness.

655
01:10:22,401 --> 01:10:23,493
Tell her to come forward.

656
01:10:53,866 --> 01:10:54,890
I want her.

657
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:19,414
Most exquisite.

658
01:11:21,026 --> 01:11:24,325
- You do me great honor.
- I take you from the one you love.

659
01:11:27,299 --> 01:11:29,267
You have to say that.
I'm the king.

660
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:34,028
I have to say that
because Venice needs you.

661
01:12:15,848 --> 01:12:17,975
What do you yearn for, IKing Henry?

662
01:12:44,476 --> 01:12:45,943
You've heard the rumors.

663
01:12:46,712 --> 01:12:47,974
Yes, sire.

664
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:50,608
The king is a pervert.

665
01:12:53,819 --> 01:12:55,787
What do you really yearn for?

666
01:12:57,756 --> 01:12:58,723
Tears.

667
01:13:01,193 --> 01:13:02,353
Your tears.

668
01:13:05,197 --> 01:13:07,062
You yearn for my tears?

669
01:13:13,839 --> 01:13:15,067
I don't think so.

670
01:13:20,345 --> 01:13:21,676
Then what do I yearn for?

671
01:14:05,457 --> 01:14:07,425
Why don't we find out?

672
01:15:02,781 --> 01:15:03,941
You'll get your ships.

673
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:17,591
- Poet to kings.
- A national asset.

674
01:15:17,796 --> 01:15:19,457
More than 100 French ships.

675
01:15:19,698 --> 01:15:21,996
We should make you
ambassador to the emperor.

676
01:15:22,701 --> 01:15:24,134
He doesn't deserve her.

677
01:15:28,874 --> 01:15:31,308
Would he sooner we didn't get the ships?

678
01:15:31,543 --> 01:15:34,944
He would rather he had the right
to refuse even a king your hand.

679
01:15:46,124 --> 01:15:47,614
I could not refuse.

680
01:15:47,826 --> 01:15:48,850
Couldn't you?

681
01:15:49,361 --> 01:15:50,828
I think you like it.

682
01:15:51,196 --> 01:15:52,823
You like what it has made me.

683
01:15:57,035 --> 01:15:58,969
I don't like what it makes me.

684
01:15:59,504 --> 01:16:00,903
Why did you not stop me?

685
01:16:02,674 --> 01:16:03,971
You're not mine to stop!

686
01:16:04,209 --> 01:16:05,540
Whose fault is that?

687
01:16:08,847 --> 01:16:10,940
You sleep with Giulia for duty's sake.

688
01:16:11,516 --> 01:16:14,917
I slept with the IKing of France once for
duty's sake. Who does not forgive?

689
01:16:16,521 --> 01:16:17,920
Perhaps I can't live with it.

690
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:35,763
I pray God to watch over you.

691
01:16:36,341 --> 01:16:38,707
Save your prayers, Veronica.

692
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:42,973
The devil's got my heart now.
God hasn't a chance.

693
01:17:47,879 --> 01:17:50,780
We were hoping you'd tell us
what's happening with the war.

694
01:18:02,894 --> 01:18:04,191
What do you know?

695
01:18:05,364 --> 01:18:07,628
Just that we're
fighting the Turks again.

696
01:18:11,103 --> 01:18:12,434
And that's all?

697
01:18:16,208 --> 01:18:19,075
Their sultan sent us an ultimatum.

698
01:18:19,277 --> 01:18:23,543
Either we surrender Cyprus or he takes it
by force. Our fleets went to defend it.

699
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:26,751
Is Cyprus so important,
we must send our husbands to battle?

700
01:18:27,386 --> 01:18:28,717
Without Cyprus...

701
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:31,354
...we lose control over
the eastern Mediterranean.

702
01:18:35,827 --> 01:18:37,385
I know we own it...

703
01:18:37,662 --> 01:18:39,596
...but where exactly is Cyprus?

704
01:18:39,931 --> 01:18:41,125
My husband...

705
01:18:41,466 --> 01:18:43,934
...do you know if he is alive or dead?

706
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:46,960
Alive and well.

707
01:18:48,874 --> 01:18:49,841
And mine?

708
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:53,844
The admiral is alive. And a hero.

709
01:18:58,083 --> 01:18:59,277
And my husband?

710
01:18:59,785 --> 01:19:00,877
Who is your husband?

711
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:01,915
Vicco.

712
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:03,917
My husband is Pietro Vicco.

713
01:19:04,089 --> 01:19:06,114
He's strong. He'll come home safely.

714
01:19:09,094 --> 01:19:10,527
You know her husband well.

715
01:19:14,866 --> 01:19:17,391
Not at all well,
but his reputation precedes him.

716
01:19:19,438 --> 01:19:20,496
Go on, ask her.

717
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:24,142
Ask her what you're longing to.

718
01:19:25,977 --> 01:19:30,710
Ask her what draws our husbands
back to her again and again...

719
01:19:32,217 --> 01:19:33,616
...like pigs to a trough!

720
01:19:43,628 --> 01:19:46,256
The Latin for banana is <i>ariena</i>.

721
01:19:48,934 --> 01:19:50,902
Banana tree is <i>pala</i>.

722
01:20:13,325 --> 01:20:16,954
A woman's greatest
and most hard-won asset...

723
01:20:17,662 --> 01:20:19,095
...is an education.

724
01:20:20,499 --> 01:20:24,697
Just because you can say it in Latin
doesn't make it less obscene.

725
01:20:24,936 --> 01:20:27,564
Just because you took a vow
doesn't mean you know love.

726
01:20:31,576 --> 01:20:36,172
Either that whore leaves or I leave.
No Christian woman could tolerate this!

727
01:20:36,414 --> 01:20:38,245
You're unfit to be a mother.

728
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:41,886
At least I am a mother.

729
01:20:47,926 --> 01:20:50,360
Thank you for your assistance,
<i>Signora</i> Franco.

730
01:21:04,910 --> 01:21:06,207
He's alive.

731
01:21:14,386 --> 01:21:15,853
You made many enemies today.

732
01:21:16,221 --> 01:21:17,586
They were already enemies.

733
01:21:17,822 --> 01:21:19,551
Now they will become more so.

734
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:23,090
Did you come to warn me?

735
01:21:32,904 --> 01:21:34,303
...make her a courtesan.

736
01:21:37,576 --> 01:21:39,066
I will not pimp your daughter.

737
01:21:39,311 --> 01:21:41,279
Look at the life you live.

738
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:43,709
The freedom that you have.

739
01:21:43,915 --> 01:21:45,780
You'll deny my daughter
the same chance?

740
01:21:49,254 --> 01:21:50,516
Turn right up ahead.

741
01:21:55,627 --> 01:21:56,594
Look.

742
01:21:57,762 --> 01:21:59,161
Look outside.

743
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:09,140
This is where we go to die.

744
01:22:10,108 --> 01:22:12,076
You will not end here.

745
01:22:15,046 --> 01:22:17,344
Livia, Venice's reigning Venus.

746
01:22:18,883 --> 01:22:20,680
A jealous lover did that.

747
01:22:23,955 --> 01:22:25,422
Who wants her now?

748
01:22:28,293 --> 01:22:30,761
My cage seems bigger than yours,
but it's still a cage.

749
01:22:30,996 --> 01:22:32,725
You won't get sympathy from me.

750
01:22:32,964 --> 01:22:34,124
I don't want it.

751
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:38,166
Do you know what my
daughter's nurse told her today?

752
01:22:39,838 --> 01:22:42,329
That in a girl's voice lies temptation.

753
01:22:44,109 --> 01:22:48,978
A known fact. Eloquence in a woman
means promiscuity.

754
01:22:49,814 --> 01:22:51,111
Promiscuity of the mind...

755
01:22:51,316 --> 01:22:54,149
...leads to promiscuity of the body.

756
01:22:56,154 --> 01:22:58,782
She doesn't believe her yet,
but she will.

757
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:00,714
She'll grow up like her mother.

758
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:04,527
She'll marry, bear children...

759
01:23:04,729 --> 01:23:08,529
...and honor her family.
Spend her youth in needlepoint...

760
01:23:11,503 --> 01:23:12,993
And when she dies...

761
01:23:13,338 --> 01:23:17,001
...she'll wonder why she obeyed
all the rules of God and country...

762
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:20,143
...because no biblical hell
could ever be worse...

763
01:23:20,345 --> 01:23:23,075
...than this state
of perpetual inconsequence.

764
01:23:31,556 --> 01:23:34,252
<i>Silent God ignores my prayer</i>

765
01:23:34,793 --> 01:23:36,192
<i>And renders lost</i>

766
01:23:36,394 --> 01:23:38,225
<i>What once was fair</i>

767
01:23:39,397 --> 01:23:42,423
<i>Once blissful</i>
<i>Fortune's favorite city</i>

768
01:23:43,802 --> 01:23:45,429
<i>Now wheeled fate turns</i>

769
01:23:46,638 --> 01:23:48,401
<i>No trace of pity</i>

770
01:23:58,316 --> 01:24:00,750
<i>Citizens of Venice!</i>

771
01:24:00,985 --> 01:24:04,682
<i>Look around you now</i>
<i>at the disease and deaths...</i>

772
01:24:04,923 --> 01:24:09,326
<i>... that have taken over</i>
<i>our once beautiful city, and tell me...</i>

773
01:24:09,828 --> 01:24:12,353
<i>... this plague is not a punishment...</i>

774
01:24:12,597 --> 01:24:13,996
<i>... from God!</i>

775
01:24:14,933 --> 01:24:18,232
<i>We are surrounded by harlots...</i>

776
01:24:18,436 --> 01:24:19,903
<i>... and courtesans!</i>

777
01:24:20,171 --> 01:24:23,504
<i>We must cast out</i>
<i>those who tempt us...</i>

778
01:24:23,775 --> 01:24:26,403
...for we are a city of shame...

779
01:24:27,345 --> 01:24:28,903
<i>... of fornication...</i>

780
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:32,911
<i>... and carnal practices</i>
<i>that defy description.</i>

781
01:24:34,352 --> 01:24:37,913
<i>We will go the way of Sodom</i>
<i>and Gomorrah...</i>

782
01:24:38,456 --> 01:24:41,516
<i>... and become dust</i>
<i>in the sands of time!</i>

783
01:24:49,801 --> 01:24:51,962
There's news from Venice.

784
01:25:25,737 --> 01:25:28,501
The corruption of flesh,
the paint on their faces...

785
01:25:29,407 --> 01:25:33,343
...the vile coloring of their hair,
their wanton dress...

786
01:25:33,678 --> 01:25:35,703
Look on them and within yourselves.

787
01:26:23,928 --> 01:26:25,293
You're alive.

788
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:27,463
You're alive.

789
01:26:38,409 --> 01:26:39,774
Forgive me.

790
01:27:02,934 --> 01:27:04,458
Please forgive me.

791
01:27:15,613 --> 01:27:16,807
I'm sorry.

792
01:28:07,131 --> 01:28:09,099
<i>Signora</i> Veronica Franco...

793
01:28:09,334 --> 01:28:14,033
...I hereby summon you to appear before
the tribunal of the Holy Inquisition.

794
01:28:16,074 --> 01:28:19,532
You have no jurisdiction here, Senator.
I speak for the Church.

795
01:28:35,293 --> 01:28:36,760
The Inquisition?

796
01:28:37,562 --> 01:28:38,529
In Venice?

797
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:40,163
We have 56,000 dead.

798
01:28:41,399 --> 01:28:44,994
The living want answers. They may be
wrong answers, but they want them.

799
01:28:45,269 --> 01:28:47,362
Be glad the bastards
aren't burning us out.

800
01:28:47,605 --> 01:28:48,731
You can stop it!

801
01:28:50,274 --> 01:28:53,710
If the doge came out in defense
of a notorious courtesan...

802
01:28:53,911 --> 01:28:57,972
Now she's notorious?
Before she was a national asset.

803
01:28:58,383 --> 01:29:00,146
It would topple the government.

804
01:29:00,385 --> 01:29:02,216
These are grim times, Senator.

805
01:29:05,890 --> 01:29:07,482
You're an elected official.

806
01:29:07,725 --> 01:29:09,625
You cannot refuse your office.

807
01:29:10,328 --> 01:29:13,297
Then you compel me
to condone these proceedings.

808
01:29:13,498 --> 01:29:15,932
Am I mistaken, or is Venice
still a free republic?

809
01:30:53,498 --> 01:30:56,661
By order of the pope, the Inquisition
has come to Venice...

810
01:30:56,901 --> 01:31:00,735
...to seek out heresy and beliefs
anathema to the Church.

811
01:31:02,039 --> 01:31:03,529
Veronica Franco...

812
01:31:04,842 --> 01:31:06,104
...you have been denounced...

813
01:31:06,310 --> 01:31:10,770
...on the charge of witchcraft,
a mortal sin punishable by death.

814
01:31:12,216 --> 01:31:15,652
Should you confess and repent
during these proceedings...

815
01:31:15,853 --> 01:31:20,222
...you will be mercifully welcomed back
into the bosom of the Holy Church.

816
01:31:23,327 --> 01:31:24,885
Your Holiness...

817
01:31:25,129 --> 01:31:26,096
Silence!

818
01:31:28,166 --> 01:31:32,933
The accused shall make no utterance but
to answer our questions or to confess.

819
01:31:33,604 --> 01:31:34,935
Proceed, Monsignor.

820
01:31:43,181 --> 01:31:44,205
Venice...

821
01:31:45,683 --> 01:31:47,617
...ever a noble republic...

822
01:31:48,186 --> 01:31:49,744
...home of learning...

823
01:31:50,454 --> 01:31:52,979
...art, commerce...

824
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:56,894
...has been brought low
by war and plague.

825
01:31:57,929 --> 01:31:59,521
Do you know why?

826
01:32:00,097 --> 01:32:02,031
I am not that wise.

827
01:32:02,466 --> 01:32:03,398
Tell us...

828
01:32:03,634 --> 01:32:04,862
...how many...

829
01:32:05,269 --> 01:32:08,568
...of the worthy men of this city
have you taken into your chamber?

830
01:32:10,741 --> 01:32:12,106
I've not counted my lovers.

831
01:32:18,216 --> 01:32:19,342
Answer the question.

832
01:32:20,952 --> 01:32:21,646
Yes.

833
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:23,187
More than 100?

834
01:32:23,421 --> 01:32:24,285
I don't know.

835
01:32:24,522 --> 01:32:25,386
You don't?

836
01:32:25,623 --> 01:32:29,150
Yet for each you paraded your
milky breast and hair of spun copper.

837
01:32:29,393 --> 01:32:31,793
For each you learned his
unique favored touch...

838
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:34,693
...and enchanted him to believe
he was the only man in the universe.

839
01:32:34,932 --> 01:32:36,263
How many per week?

840
01:32:37,301 --> 01:32:39,360
I told you. I enchanted no one.

841
01:32:39,637 --> 01:32:43,903
Did you feign love with more than 10
weekly? Or would 5 or 6 have sated you?

842
01:32:44,075 --> 01:32:45,167
I never feigned love.

843
01:32:45,409 --> 01:32:46,341
So why'd they pay?

844
01:32:48,913 --> 01:32:50,141
For the dream of love...

845
01:32:51,849 --> 01:32:55,148
...as it cannot exist in this world
that you've created.

846
01:32:56,254 --> 01:32:59,655
For the hope there might exist
on earth some corner of this paradise...

847
01:32:59,857 --> 01:33:01,154
Paradise?

848
01:33:01,926 --> 01:33:03,518
When 56,000 have fallen?

849
01:33:03,861 --> 01:33:04,885
You say this.

850
01:33:05,096 --> 01:33:06,063
You...

851
01:33:06,697 --> 01:33:09,894
...who fill your home with feast
and dance while Venice suffers?

852
01:33:10,101 --> 01:33:12,592
Who creates a sumptuous
world of flesh...

853
01:33:12,803 --> 01:33:15,704
...and depravity, of orgiastic rites
invoking the devil?

854
01:33:15,906 --> 01:33:18,340
- This is paradise?
- The only devilry here is your spite!

855
01:33:19,043 --> 01:33:20,840
He's jealous of what he cannot have!

856
01:33:21,012 --> 01:33:22,980
Do not intrude into the proceedings.

857
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:26,411
I'm a senator of Venice.
The Inquisition is here by our consent.

858
01:33:26,651 --> 01:33:30,212
This is an ecclesiastical court.
You are here by my consent.

859
01:33:30,454 --> 01:33:32,046
This is a personal vendetta.

860
01:33:32,290 --> 01:33:34,656
You will abide by our rules
or be removed.

861
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:36,190
Is that understood?

862
01:33:37,728 --> 01:33:39,559
Is that understood?

863
01:33:48,839 --> 01:33:50,864
The senator speaks the truth.

864
01:33:51,976 --> 01:33:53,375
I was bewitched by her.

865
01:33:57,748 --> 01:34:01,912
In my weakness, I fell under her spell
to pathetic ruin.

866
01:34:02,153 --> 01:34:04,815
It's only by the grace of God
I stand here today.

867
01:34:05,589 --> 01:34:06,715
I didn't seek your love.

868
01:34:06,924 --> 01:34:09,449
Because I could not pay your fee.

869
01:34:10,227 --> 01:34:11,387
I loved another.

870
01:34:11,762 --> 01:34:13,024
In other words...

871
01:34:13,230 --> 01:34:16,097
...you cast your spell over all
who cross your path.

872
01:34:16,334 --> 01:34:21,237
You compel sacred love to garner riches.
What is this if not witchcraft?

873
01:34:22,206 --> 01:34:24,333
Ever give yourself to a man
who couldn't pay?

874
01:34:24,608 --> 01:34:26,906
I gave my heart where
riches were no use.

875
01:34:27,078 --> 01:34:28,545
I did what was needed to live.

876
01:34:28,779 --> 01:34:31,213
Did you give yourself
to a man who could not pay?

877
01:34:31,415 --> 01:34:36,011
What other profession do you allow me?
How shall I survive if I cannot marry?

878
01:34:36,253 --> 01:34:37,311
Answer!

879
01:34:37,555 --> 01:34:40,023
Why, when you are determined to damn me?

880
01:34:42,259 --> 01:34:43,317
Look at her.

881
01:34:44,428 --> 01:34:45,395
Feel her wrath...

882
01:34:48,032 --> 01:34:52,469
She, who lures the noble fathers
of Venice from their wives...

883
01:34:52,737 --> 01:34:53,897
...their children...

884
01:34:54,538 --> 01:34:56,369
...their ability to lead the republic!

885
01:34:56,741 --> 01:35:00,700
It is she and her kind who turned
God's hands against us, Your Grace.

886
01:35:00,945 --> 01:35:02,276
Your Grace...

887
01:35:02,747 --> 01:35:03,873
...we must do our duty.

888
01:35:05,383 --> 01:35:09,513
Veronica Franco, you hover at the brink
of extermination and hell.

889
01:35:10,221 --> 01:35:14,419
You will return tomorrow to hear God's
merciful judgment and, I hope...

890
01:35:15,292 --> 01:35:18,750
...to repent before that judgment
takes its course.

891
01:35:19,497 --> 01:35:20,964
Remove the prisoner.

892
01:36:01,472 --> 01:36:02,871
You must save yourself.

893
01:36:03,941 --> 01:36:04,805
How?

894
01:36:05,142 --> 01:36:08,236
Confess whatever foolishness
they put before you...

895
01:36:08,779 --> 01:36:09,746
That I'm a witch?

896
01:36:09,914 --> 01:36:11,438
What does it matter what you say?

897
01:36:11,715 --> 01:36:13,580
I would be saying it.

898
01:36:14,351 --> 01:36:16,979
There is no honor with fools like these.

899
01:36:17,488 --> 01:36:18,819
God will forgive you.

900
01:36:20,791 --> 01:36:23,885
If I give them my lie,
I give them my soul.

901
01:36:24,495 --> 01:36:26,929
I'll lose everything I ever was.

902
01:36:27,498 --> 01:36:29,398
My love, my words, my heart.

903
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:30,658
But you would live.

904
01:36:32,169 --> 01:36:33,761
As someone else.

905
01:36:34,171 --> 01:36:37,140
I've let you go too many times.

906
01:36:37,942 --> 01:36:39,170
I can't do it again.

907
01:36:41,011 --> 01:36:42,808
There is no choice.

908
01:36:52,189 --> 01:36:53,554
I'll never see you again.

909
01:37:29,927 --> 01:37:33,693
Veronica Franco, you have been
denounced a sorceress.

910
01:37:34,865 --> 01:37:39,165
Either confess and plead mercy,
or stand to receive my judgment.

911
01:37:41,338 --> 01:37:42,965
I will confess, Your Grace.

912
01:37:49,747 --> 01:37:51,874
That will please God.

913
01:37:52,416 --> 01:37:53,246
Proceed.

914
01:37:55,085 --> 01:37:56,552
I confess...

915
01:37:56,754 --> 01:38:00,520
...as a girl I loved a man who would not
marry me for want of a dowry.

916
01:38:01,892 --> 01:38:05,259
I confess I had a mother
who taught me a different way of life.

917
01:38:05,930 --> 01:38:08,296
One I resisted at first
but learned to embrace.

918
01:38:09,266 --> 01:38:11,734
I confess I became a courtesan.

919
01:38:11,936 --> 01:38:15,872
Traded yearning for power, welcomed many
rather than be owned by one.

920
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:17,905
She does not speak to the charge.

921
01:38:18,075 --> 01:38:22,205
I confess I embraced a whore's freedom
over a wife's obedience.

922
01:38:22,446 --> 01:38:24,414
This is not repentance.

923
01:38:25,115 --> 01:38:26,582
What am I to do?

924
01:38:26,850 --> 01:38:29,648
I must confess my evil.
These are my sins.

925
01:38:30,054 --> 01:38:33,251
Your Grace, her mortal sins
are not at issue.

926
01:38:33,557 --> 01:38:35,320
She must repent witchcraft.

927
01:38:35,726 --> 01:38:38,194
Perhaps she heads in that direction.

928
01:38:38,462 --> 01:38:39,588
You have been warned.

929
01:38:39,863 --> 01:38:44,357
The Church cannot deny her right to seek
God's mercy. Confession is sacrosanct.

930
01:38:44,969 --> 01:38:47,028
Don't instruct me on the Church's laws!

931
01:38:47,304 --> 01:38:51,604
Then I call upon the doge to demand
that the Inquisition abide by them.

932
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:57,246
If Christian mercy is gone, then
at least Venetian justice still exists.

933
01:38:57,615 --> 01:39:00,448
I pray Your Grace has heard
enough of this.

934
01:39:03,587 --> 01:39:08,024
It does seem odd that the Holy Mother
Church would deny a sinner confession.

935
01:39:08,659 --> 01:39:10,991
I see no harm in hearing her.

936
01:39:11,929 --> 01:39:14,056
She will save or damn herself.

937
01:39:14,298 --> 01:39:16,789
The prisoner has already damned herself.

938
01:39:17,334 --> 01:39:21,134
But if it pleases the
esteemed doge of Venice...

939
01:39:21,338 --> 01:39:22,930
...she may continue her heresy.

940
01:39:29,013 --> 01:39:32,949
I confess I find more ecstasy
in passion than in prayer.

941
01:39:40,290 --> 01:39:41,814
I confess...

942
01:39:42,526 --> 01:39:44,994
I confess I pray still...

943
01:39:46,030 --> 01:39:48,794
...to feel the touch
of my lover's lips...

944
01:39:49,533 --> 01:39:51,592
...his hands upon me...

945
01:39:53,404 --> 01:39:55,167
...his arms enfolding me.

946
01:39:55,372 --> 01:39:56,464
Veronica, stop!

947
01:39:57,374 --> 01:39:59,274
Save yourself, please.

948
01:40:01,412 --> 01:40:04,381
Such surrender has been mine.

949
01:40:06,417 --> 01:40:10,877
I confess I hunger still
to be filled and inflamed.

950
01:40:11,188 --> 01:40:13,588
To melt into the dream of us...

951
01:40:14,525 --> 01:40:16,254
...beyond this troubled place...

952
01:40:19,096 --> 01:40:21,064
...to where we are not even ourselves.

953
01:40:22,032 --> 01:40:24,057
To know that always...

954
01:40:24,768 --> 01:40:26,702
...always this is mine.

955
01:40:27,304 --> 01:40:28,703
Your Grace...

956
01:40:29,206 --> 01:40:30,901
...is this necessary?

957
01:40:31,208 --> 01:40:33,108
She hopes to bewitch us all.

958
01:40:33,544 --> 01:40:37,913
If this had not been mine,
if I had lived another way...

959
01:40:38,282 --> 01:40:40,216
...a child to a husband's whim...

960
01:40:40,551 --> 01:40:43,452
...my soul hardened from lack of touch
and lack of love...

961
01:40:43,787 --> 01:40:46,153
...I confess such endless days
and nights...

962
01:40:46,356 --> 01:40:49,189
...would be punishment greater
than any you could mete out.

963
01:40:49,393 --> 01:40:50,087
Finished?

964
01:40:50,627 --> 01:40:52,026
No, Your Grace.

965
01:40:53,464 --> 01:40:54,692
You, all of you...

966
01:40:56,633 --> 01:41:01,570
...who hunger for what I give but cannot
bear to see such power in a woman...

967
01:41:03,474 --> 01:41:06,307
...you call God's greatest gift...

968
01:41:07,911 --> 01:41:09,538
...ourselves...

969
01:41:09,813 --> 01:41:13,249
...our yearning, our need to love,
you call it filth...

970
01:41:13,484 --> 01:41:14,917
...and sin and heresy...

971
01:41:15,185 --> 01:41:19,588
Enough. One last time before you are
condemned: Do you repent or not?

972
01:41:20,657 --> 01:41:25,117
I repent there was no other way
open to me. I do not repent my life.

973
01:41:25,362 --> 01:41:30,061
Then the Holy Inquisition has heard the
evidence against you and is satisfied.

974
01:41:30,734 --> 01:41:32,201
In the name of the pope...

975
01:41:33,437 --> 01:41:34,904
There is more to be heard.

976
01:41:35,873 --> 01:41:37,602
I demand the same rights of confession!

977
01:41:37,841 --> 01:41:38,808
You're not on trial!

978
01:41:38,976 --> 01:41:42,537
We're still on consecrated ground.
I confess I am her accomplice.

979
01:41:45,516 --> 01:41:50,044
If she is a witch, damn me. I do not
repent. I will not live without her.

980
01:41:55,526 --> 01:41:58,120
This is a cynical trick.
He does this to save her.

981
01:41:58,362 --> 01:41:59,659
She's a witch!

982
01:42:00,531 --> 01:42:02,624
Proven and convicted,
the devil in our midst...

983
01:42:02,866 --> 01:42:06,302
...and I am her accomplice!
Condemn her if you will...

984
01:42:06,503 --> 01:42:09,438
...but arrest me too. Arrest a senator
of Venice for witchcraft.

985
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:11,608
I'll not shrink
from judging the mighty.

986
01:42:11,809 --> 01:42:13,834
I welcome it. I wait for the shackles.

987
01:42:14,077 --> 01:42:15,772
He speaks with his heart,
not his head.

988
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:18,511
He's blinded by his own lust.

989
01:42:18,715 --> 01:42:20,979
If she's a witch,
so is every woman in Venice!

990
01:42:25,989 --> 01:42:27,456
Silence!

991
01:42:35,098 --> 01:42:37,032
We are a strange city,
Your Holiness.

992
01:42:38,468 --> 01:42:40,197
Perhaps accursed.

993
01:42:49,279 --> 01:42:51,975
And perhaps we live
in a peculiar state of grace.

994
01:42:53,450 --> 01:42:55,611
I am not alone...

995
01:42:56,119 --> 01:42:58,178
...in loving this woman...

996
01:42:58,455 --> 01:43:01,481
...though I love her far, far more
than they.

997
01:43:04,228 --> 01:43:05,354
...were many...

998
01:43:06,730 --> 01:43:08,129
...and proud.

999
01:43:08,932 --> 01:43:10,900
If we do not speak now...

1000
01:43:12,803 --> 01:43:14,168
...if Venice...

1001
01:43:14,371 --> 01:43:18,967
...does not stand up now and acknowledge
who she is, then we are all damned...

1002
01:43:19,810 --> 01:43:20,902
...not before this court...

1003
01:43:22,546 --> 01:43:23,843
...before eternity.

1004
01:43:25,883 --> 01:43:27,976
If what he says is true...

1005
01:43:29,386 --> 01:43:32,219
...then you must speak the names
of your accomplices.

1006
01:43:33,957 --> 01:43:35,322
Your Grace...

1007
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:38,860
...the men who loved her
were under her spell.

1008
01:43:39,029 --> 01:43:40,656
They had no volition.

1009
01:43:40,898 --> 01:43:43,332
Shall we punish
even the victims of her evil?

1010
01:43:44,935 --> 01:43:47,426
If the soul of the city is corrupt...

1011
01:43:47,804 --> 01:43:50,864
...and you help me root it out,
I will spare your life.

1012
01:43:58,115 --> 01:44:00,606
I had no accomplices, Your Grace.

1013
01:44:05,989 --> 01:44:06,887
Stand.

1014
01:44:10,594 --> 01:44:11,652
Stand!

1015
01:44:13,964 --> 01:44:15,056
Stand...

1016
01:44:15,332 --> 01:44:18,062
...all you who defiled
your sacred marriage beds...

1017
01:44:18,335 --> 01:44:20,735
...and declare your sin.
Stand up...

1018
01:44:20,938 --> 01:44:22,030
...with me...

1019
01:44:22,306 --> 01:44:25,139
...as we stood against
our enemies at sea!

1020
01:44:35,852 --> 01:44:36,876
There.

1021
01:44:38,088 --> 01:44:39,646
You see, Your Grace...

1022
01:44:40,657 --> 01:44:42,955
...there are no accomplices.

1023
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:45,822
He does this to rescue her
from your justice.

1024
01:44:46,029 --> 01:44:50,762
Then I stand alone for Venice
and for this woman.

1025
01:44:55,172 --> 01:44:57,265
His trial will commence tomorrow.

1026
01:45:05,716 --> 01:45:06,842
Minister.

1027
01:45:07,718 --> 01:45:08,878
Do you wish to speak?

1028
01:45:11,655 --> 01:45:14,385
I repeat, do you have something
to say to this court?

1029
01:45:16,393 --> 01:45:17,860
I am standing.

1030
01:45:52,295 --> 01:45:53,319
Your Grace.

1031
01:45:59,236 --> 01:46:01,363
Perhaps there's another
who'd like to stand?

1032
01:46:15,385 --> 01:46:18,548
Perhaps we've been hasty, Your Grace.

1033
01:46:19,089 --> 01:46:20,147
What are you doing?

1034
01:46:20,724 --> 01:46:23,318
Witchcraft may be too harsh a charge.

1035
01:46:30,734 --> 01:46:32,201
Is everything...

1036
01:46:32,469 --> 01:46:34,096
...I heard about this city true?

1037
01:46:34,938 --> 01:46:39,466
Surely the Holy Inquisition need not
sully its hands with a common whore.

1038
01:46:41,078 --> 01:46:44,343
This is a matter for the state,
don't you think?

1039
01:46:59,429 --> 01:47:00,896
I leave this woman to Venice...

1040
01:47:03,433 --> 01:47:05,230
...which richly deserves her.
