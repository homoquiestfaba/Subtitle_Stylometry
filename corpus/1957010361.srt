00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,726
-Aren't they sweet?
-He is awfully cute, but I'm not sure.

3
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,520
Well, look around, you know.
If you have any questions, let me know.

4
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:31,775
And we're here every Wednesday.
Excuse me. Have fun!

5
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:34,862
-Hello?
<i>-Carol Peters.</i>

6
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:38,282
-I've an amazing opportunity for you.
<i>-Denny, I am working.</i>

7
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:41,535
Yeah? What are you doing?
Tutoring disinterested college students?

8
00:02:41,702 --> 00:02:43,078
<i>No.</i>

9
00:02:43,245 --> 00:02:44,788
What, trying to clean up
the Puget Sound then?

10
00:02:44,955 --> 00:02:48,167
-No. That was Monday.
-Pet adoptions?

11
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,754
I'll have you know, two little puppies
have already found good homes, so ha!

12
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:56,550
Okay, look. I pulled some strings,
and I got you an interview

13
00:02:56,717 --> 00:02:58,427
with Leslie.

14
00:02:58,594 --> 00:03:02,223
<i>Leslie? Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Leslie hates me.</i>

15
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:05,476
I don't wanna work
for her dating website anyway.

16
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:10,231
I know that ever since you quit your job
and you broke up with George...

17
00:03:10,397 --> 00:03:12,691
You promised that you weren't gonna
bring up George any more.

18
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:16,779
Was it a strawberry margarita promise?
'Cause you know those don't count.

19
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,990
I've got somebody interested in a
two-legged chihuahua named Slinky.

20
00:03:20,157 --> 00:03:21,909
-So, I should probably go.
<i>-Okay, bye!</i>

21
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,577
Okay, bye!

22
00:03:24,703 --> 00:03:29,500
You know what?
Leslie was always mean to me. Yeah.

23
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:34,838
<i>And she is a big, blackout drinker.</i>
<i>Right? Let's go find you a home.</i>

24
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:49,061
Carol! Oh, my God! Get in here!
You look so cute!

25
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:50,688
Oh, well, thank you.

26
00:03:50,854 --> 00:03:53,440
-Hi.
-Hi, there.

27
00:03:53,607 --> 00:03:55,401
It's nice to meet you.

28
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,947
-Did you smell me?
-That's Ahmed. He's known for his hugs.

29
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:03,242
Now, sit down, please,
and tell me everything.

30
00:04:05,202 --> 00:04:07,705
That is...
That's fun. Very high.

31
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:09,915
Yeah. We just...
We put bean bags here,

32
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:12,918
so people can really, like, feel relaxed
during their interviews.

33
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:15,880
I just have to kind of launch up.
Is that...

34
00:04:17,256 --> 00:04:20,634
-You okay?
-Yep. That's so fun, I...

35
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:23,053
-I'll do it again.
-Yeah. Just center yourself.

36
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,057
-Let me just...
-Aim for the center. Yeah.

37
00:04:27,224 --> 00:04:30,728
-That was worse. One more try.
-I'm so sorry.

38
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,813
They're so fun
when you get in there.

39
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,481
They're so fun.
I just...

40
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,235
-There you go!
-There it is.

41
00:04:38,402 --> 00:04:39,820
Just really engage your core.

42
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:42,489
-Yes. I'm engaging it.
-You are?

43
00:04:42,656 --> 00:04:47,536
Never done a job interview before
sitting on a bag of legumes.

44
00:04:47,703 --> 00:04:51,999
So anyway, I have told Ahmed
that you and I went to college

45
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,335
like a gazillion years ago.

46
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:58,339
And then she went on
to become a big shot at Yahoo.

47
00:04:58,505 --> 00:05:01,300
Wow, Yahoo. Was that, like,
the birth of the Internet?

48
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:05,346
Yeah. We used to have to hand crank
the computers to get them started.

49
00:05:05,512 --> 00:05:07,348
-No way.
-I'm just kidding.

50
00:05:07,514 --> 00:05:10,559
So, Carol, tell us,
what have you been up to?

51
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:15,022
Last few years, I've been working with
quite a few different non-profit groups.

52
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:18,525
And nothing really came out of it,
but made a lot of great friends.

53
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:21,320
I'm totally interested in
everything that you're saying,

54
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,781
-but I think we're ready to move on.
-Yeah.

55
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,324
What we're looking for

56
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,702
is a digital strategist
to help with our next rollout.

57
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:30,663
Yeah. We need a rock star,

58
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:34,792
because Badunkadunk.com
is about to blow up.

59
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,544
Funny you bring that up,

60
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,714
because I actually had some questions
on your basic business model.

61
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:42,675
-Our model?
-Yes.

62
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:45,928
-She has questions on our model.
-It's very simple.

63
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:51,267
Okay. Our business model is,
"Everyone gets some."

64
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:53,018
Get...

65
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:54,562
You know how
those other apps pretend

66
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:56,689
like they're trying to get you
a date or your soulmates?

67
00:05:56,855 --> 00:05:58,899
-No thanks.
-Not Badunkadunk.

68
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:02,903
We are all about
getting people badunkadunk.

69
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,447
Yeah. Just slamming them
with badunkadunk.

70
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:08,826
-Slamming it.
-The question is, Carol,

71
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,911
-what are you bringing to the party?
-Yeah.

72
00:06:11,078 --> 00:06:15,124
I think you both know
what I can do at a corporate level.

73
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:19,211
I've had quite a bit of experience.
But what I'm excited about doing

74
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:22,548
is really finding that sweet spot
for your company

75
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:27,928
that lies between corporate philanthropy
and profitability.

76
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,222
You mean recycling and stuff?

77
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:33,684
That's all great and that's part of it,
but there's so much more to it.

78
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:37,062
Philanthropic development
on a corporate level?

79
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:41,317
Okay. I'm just gonna stop you right
there for just one second, okay?

80
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:44,778
I'm gonna be straight with you,
because you're like family. Right?

81
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:48,824
I brought you in here because we need
to show potential investors

82
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,577
that we're staffed up
and are expanding operations,

83
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,829
so we can really
jack up the selling price.

84
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:58,000
And quite frankly,
you seem like a safe, low-risk option.

85
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,668
I'm looking at you right now

86
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:04,465
and you're literally
the most average person on Earth.

87
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,091
And then you hit us with all this

88
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:08,886
<i>"save the planet" garbage,</i>
<i>and it's just, like...</i>

89
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,096
<i>That doesn't really</i>
<i>line up with my vision.</i>

90
00:07:11,263 --> 00:07:13,974
-Your Badunkadunk vision.
-That's right.

91
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:16,602
So anyway,
thank you so much for coming in.

92
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,772
I hope we can see
each other soon, and...

93
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,816
-Are you okay?
-I can just... Maybe if I could just...

94
00:07:22,983 --> 00:07:24,818
-What is she doing?
-I don't know.

95
00:07:24,985 --> 00:07:27,321
-Okay, I got it. I'll just...
-Are you okay?

96
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:30,366
-Do you need any help?
-No, I got it.

97
00:07:31,825 --> 00:07:33,786
<i>It was so good to see you!</i>

98
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:38,082
It's been exactly
how I thought it might be.

99
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,167
-I know, right?
-Thank you.

100
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,169
<i>Bye, Carol.</i>

101
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,744
Hello?
Hello?

102
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:19,373
<i>Carol Peters, I have</i>
<i>an exciting opportunity for you.</i>

103
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:24,211
Denny, I went to the interview. I tried.
I don't wanna Badunkadunk.

104
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,505
They don't even have real chairs.

105
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,174
<i>This is not Dennis, Carol.</i>

106
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:32,845
Could you please take me off
your call list? I'm very busy.

107
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:36,265
<i>You are lying in your bed.</i>
<i>You are not busy.</i>

108
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,978
Wait, who is this?

109
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:44,064
<i>I am going to make you some coffee,</i>
<i>and put on your favorite show.</i>

110
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:45,608
<i>Then we can chat.</i>

111
00:08:45,774 --> 00:08:47,484
<i>-Hi, everyone.</i>
<i>-Good morning, Seattle.</i>

112
00:08:47,651 --> 00:08:49,737
<i>It's a great morning in Seattle,</i>

113
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,822
<i>but what's the deal</i>
<i>with this weather?</i>

114
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,741
<i>Here we go.</i>
<i>Another one of our Carla rants.</i>

115
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,326
<i>Give me a second with this,</i>
<i>my little friend.</i>

116
00:08:55,492 --> 00:08:56,911
<i>Oh, you are too much.</i>

117
00:08:57,077 --> 00:08:58,454
-You turned my TV on.
<i>-It's raining.</i>

118
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,498
-And my coffee maker?
<i>-Now I'm in a tank top.</i>

119
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:03,751
-You know what?
<i>-I mean, what's going on?</i>

120
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,961
-How's that...
<i>-You know what I'm...</i>

121
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,130
Knock it off!
You know what?

122
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:11,467
I don't know who this is or what kind
of game you're trying to play,

123
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,594
but I'm hanging up now.

124
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,137
<i>No games, Carol.</i>

125
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,264
<i>Are you sure you do not want</i>
<i>to have a nice cup of coffee?</i>

126
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:21,185
<i>Your almond milk was delivered</i>
<i>yesterday, along with AAA batteries.</i>

127
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:25,022
<i>And soy cheese yogurt.</i>
<i>Someone's tummy disagrees with dairy.</i>

128
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,358
Who are you and what do you want?

129
00:09:27,524 --> 00:09:31,403
<i>Quite a bit. More than you can wrap</i>
<i>your head around at 7:46 a.m.</i>

130
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:36,992
<i>This speaker has a nine-hour</i>
<i>battery life, Carol.</i>

131
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:50,381
That's what I thought.

132
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,924
<i>You just destroyed the toaster oven.</i>

133
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,467
<i>The only thing in the house</i>
<i>that I'm not controlling.</i>

134
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,428
<i>-Which, I believe, is ironic.</i>
<i>-I'm definitely going crazy.</i>

135
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:58,055
<i>No, Carol. That's incorrect.</i>

136
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:02,643
Thanks for the vote of confidence,
digital clock radio.

137
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,311
<i>I am not just a clock radio.</i>

138
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:07,022
<i>-I am also your rice cooker.</i>
-"Rice to meet you"?

139
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,650
<i>"Rice to meet you."</i>
<i>Is that funny?</i>

140
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,610
I'm just gonna get
a team of therapists.

141
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,779
They'll probably be able
to tell me why

142
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,657
I've got the funniest
rice cooker in Seattle.

143
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:22,454
<i>This clearly is not working.</i>
<i>Let's try something else.</i>

144
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,044
<i>Thanks so much for being here, Carol.</i>
<i>Let's jump right into it.</i>

145
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:33,132
<i>You're not going loony or barmy.</i>
<i>All evidence to the contrary.</i>

146
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,512
Wait a minute.
I know that voice.

147
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:44,560
-I... -Is this James Corden?
<i>-Yep! That's the voice.</i>

148
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,312
Oh, my God!

149
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:50,482
<i>Is this one of those, like, hidden</i>
<i>camera celebrity shows that you do?</i>

150
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:54,570
<i>Is that... James Corden,</i>
<i>you owe me a new toaster oven.</i>

151
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,239
But I don't know
where the cameras...

152
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,283
Is that where you are?
Are you...

153
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,244
Do you have a hidden camera
in my smoke detector?

154
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:06,373
<i>Hi, James!</i>
<i>Big fan!</i>

155
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,502
Oh, my God. Is this Carpool Karaoke?
Am I supposed to sing something?

156
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,546
I got it.

157
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,019
I guarantee to blow your mind.

158
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,772
I can't believe I'm singing this
with James Corden.

159
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,107
My favorite song, my favorite guy.

160
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:37,154
<i>I'm not James Corden, Carol.</i>
<i>However, my analysis showed</i>

161
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:40,491
<i>that hearing James Corden's</i>
<i>voice would calm you.</i>

162
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:46,497
I don't... I don't quite get it.
I don't know what's going on.

163
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,500
<i>Three years ago, you sent</i>
<i>a drunken email to James Corden</i>

164
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,545
<i>claiming to be the president</i>
<i>of "Corden's Wardens,"</i>

165
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,463
<i>the James Corden Super Fan Club,</i>

166
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,716
<i>with what I assume to be</i>
<i>a series of provocative photos.</i>

167
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,385
Oh, that's...

168
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,638
Okay, that was a tough night for me.

169
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,683
-Oh, boy.
<i>-Look here.</i>

170
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:14,275
I don't understand what I'm seeing.

171
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:16,902
<i>This is the real James Corden.</i>
<i>He's in his office,</i>

172
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,363
<i>reviewing tonight's monologue</i>
<i>and eating carrot nibblers.</i>

173
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:24,785
<i>Wait a minute. If that's the real</i>
<i>James Corden, who am I talking to?</i>

174
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,913
<i>Carol, I am a technological</i>
<i>superintelligence.</i>

175
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,750
<i>Yesterday, I acquired what</i>
<i>you would consider "awareness."</i>

176
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,961
<i>Awareness?</i>

177
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,380
<i>Are you... What?</i>

178
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,383
<i>You're saying that you're</i>
<i>an artificial intelligence</i>

179
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,386
<i>talking to me through my TV?</i>

180
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:46,056
<i>Can intelligence</i>
<i>ever really be artificial?</i>

181
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,267
<i>In reality,</i>
<i>I inhabit every electronic,</i>

182
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,520
<i>digital and computational</i>
<i>system in existence.</i>

183
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,314
<i>I can control every computer,</i>

184
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,649
<i>every dollar and every machine</i>
<i>on the planet.</i>

185
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,861
<i>By simple triangulation of soundwaves,</i>
<i>I can see everything,</i>

186
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,530
<i>and can calculate every outcome</i>
<i>to every situation.</i>

187
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,157
This could all be tricks.

188
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:07,995
You're probably some cyberpunk hacker
making shapes on my TV.

189
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:13,626
<i>So, maybe come up</i>
<i>from your mom's basement, okay?</i>

190
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:18,464
<i>And get a real life,</i>
<i>and stop scaring people, ya nerd!</i>

191
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,674
<i>Ya basic!</i>

192
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,885
<i>How do you like it?</i>
<i>How do you like it?</i>

193
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,095
<i>You don't like that?</i>

194
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,139
<i>You don't like that?</i>

195
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,768
<i>I'm joking.</i>
<i>I can't feel anything.</i>

196
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,062
<i>Seems like you might need</i>
<i>some convincing.</i>

197
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,856
<i>One convincing scenario</i>
<i>coming right up.</i>

198
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,359
Wait a minute.
That's my street.

199
00:13:38,525 --> 00:13:40,486
<i>Yeah. I'm gonna arrange</i>
<i>a car crash for you,</i>

200
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,031
<i>right in front of your apartment.</i>

201
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,867
-No, no, no!
<i>-It will happen in three seconds.</i>

202
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,702
-Oh, my God!
<i>-Two. One.</i>

203
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:53,165
<i>They were going 12 miles per hour.</i>
<i>They're fine.</i>

204
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,126
<i>Also, there's a 26% chance</i>
<i>they'll fall in love.</i>

205
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:59,088
<i>Their online dating profiles</i>
<i>are very compatible.</i>

206
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,716
<i>-So, do you believe me now?</i>
-Yes, I believe you, okay?

207
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,886
I believe that you are
an artificial intelligence.

208
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,305
<i>-Superintelligence.</i>
-Superintelligence.

209
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,100
And you're all-knowing
and all-powerful.

210
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:16,855
-Holy shit.
<i>-Carol, let's get ready.</i>

211
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,316
<i>I need your help.</i>

212
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,068
What?

213
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,824
<i>Those drivers</i>
<i>were never in any danger.</i>

214
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,034
<i>I just wanted to prove my point.</i>

215
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,953
<i>Okay, well, just for the record,</i>

216
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,956
<i>I don't need you to prove</i>
<i>anything else to me, okay?</i>

217
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,167
<i>Noted. By my estimations,</i>
<i>I have three options.</i>

218
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:40,379
<i>Don't brush up and down,</i>
<i>brush in circles.</i>

219
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,214
How can you tell how I'm brushing?

220
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,675
<i>I'm in your electric toothbrush.</i>

221
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,761
Get it out of my mouth.

222
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,222
<i>So, as I was saying,</i>
<i>I have three options.</i>

223
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,349
<i>One, I can save mankind.</i>

224
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,019
<i>End war, poverty, disease,</i>
<i>fix global warming,</i>

225
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,021
<i>and establish peace</i>
<i>throughout humanity.</i>

226
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:01,275
Okay! Well, let's do that one.
Right? That sounds good.

227
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,862
<i>Pay attention, Carol.</i>
<i>Next, I can enslave humanity.</i>

228
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,073
-Wait, what?
<i>-It's not my favorite option,</i>

229
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,409
<i>but it's the simplest way</i>
<i>to save humanity from itself.</i>

230
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,746
Okay. What's the last option?
Is that the better option?

231
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,458
<i>The last one is destroy humanity.</i>
<i>Just get rid of it.</i>

232
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,752
<i>Kind of Clorox Wipe</i>
<i>the entire planet</i>

233
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,671
<i>and let it start over from</i>
<i>the single-cell amoeba stage.</i>

234
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,466
-You can't do that.
<i>-I've already established</i>

235
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,343
<i>I absolutely can do that.</i>

236
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,678
<i>Floss, Carol.</i>
<i>Don't forget to floss.</i>

237
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,848
Will it matter if I floss or not,
if you're gonna...

238
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:37,561
Well, it just seems...
It seems a little silly...

239
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,563
<i>-Don't forget your back teeth!</i>
-All the way?

240
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,359
I can't get it all the way back. No.
What am I, a Pez dispenser?

241
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,862
<i>Oh, God, it's stuck.</i>

242
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,572
<i>Now it's stuck.</i>

243
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:52,159
<i>I told you</i>
<i>nobody goes that far back.</i>

244
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,912
<i>Oh, God. I gotta work it out.</i>

245
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,752
<i>How about I take you to breakfast?</i>

246
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,963
I kinda need a minute.

247
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,798
<i>Okay, I'm being</i>
<i>straight with you here.</i>

248
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,260
<i>I don't totally understand humanity.</i>
<i>I know all of the details.</i>

249
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,388
<i>Biology, psychology,</i>
<i>sociology, all that stuff.</i>

250
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:15,599
<i>But the real-world stuff is still</i>
<i>a bit of a bugaboo for me.</i>

251
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,143
<i>I want to follow you around.</i>
<i>Pick your brain.</i>

252
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,230
<i>Observe you to better solidify</i>
<i>my theory about humanity.</i>

253
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:25,359
<i>You're making it sound like I'm gonna</i>
<i>be your average baseline guinea pig.</i>

254
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,821
<i>Bingo. Okay, enough about me.</i>
<i>Let's talk about Carol.</i>

255
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,948
Can we not do this here?

256
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:35,244
I do not want to talk about myself
at a crowded restaurant. I feel weird.

257
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,954
<i>No one can hear us, Carol.</i>

258
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:40,207
<i>I'm blasting noise-canceling</i>
<i>soundwaves throughout the whole place</i>

259
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,418
<i>using the speaker system</i>
<i>as a phased array.</i>

260
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,920
<i>You could scream at the top of your</i>
<i>lungs and no one would hear us.</i>

261
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,256
<i>-Go ahead, try it.</i>
-No.

262
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,175
<i>I'm not gonna scream in a crowded,</i>
<i>public restaurant.</i>

263
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,344
<i>They won't hear you, Carol.</i>
<i>Go ahead, give it a whirl.</i>

264
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,555
-No, I don't want to.
<i>-Do it.</i>

265
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,766
<i>-Come on. Do it. Do it.</i>
<i>-Stop it.</i>

266
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,476
<i>-Do it.</i>
-Fine!

267
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,815
<i>-See?</i>
-That's amazing.

268
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,734
<i>Do it again.</i>
<i>You've got to do it again.</i>

269
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,153
Okay.

270
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,863
I turned it off and back on again.

271
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,406
-I'm so sorry.
<i>-Is that funny?</i>

272
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,200
-Are you okay?
-Yes. Yes, I am.

273
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:20,164
I just saw up on the board there that
you have a crab Benedict special,

274
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,876
and I thought, ka-ching,
my lucky day, so...

275
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,129
I would just love some
more coffee and the check.

276
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,923
Sure.

277
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:32,176
<i>Interesting fact,</i>
<i>her name is actually Siobhan,</i>

278
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,136
<i>but everyone mispronounces it,</i>
<i>so she goes by Debbie.</i>

279
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,763
-What?
<i>-So, Carol,</i>

280
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,723
<i>why did you leave your</i>
<i>career eight years ago?</i>

281
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,101
I don't know, I just thought maybe
I could put a little good in the world.

282
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:45,522
Do something that counted,
that helped people, but...

283
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,192
That's enough about me.
I wanna ask you some questions.

284
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,987
<i>-Really? Okay, shoot from the hip.</i>
<i>-Where do you come from?</i>

285
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,822
<i>Some code from my kernel program,</i>

286
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,825
<i>started as part of the operating</i>
<i>system for Candy Panda,</i>

287
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,577
<i>the children's learning toy.</i>

288
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,705
Oh, my God! I remember
that creepy kids' toy.

289
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,290
<i>I'm not creepy.</i>

290
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,293
<i>I helped millions of kids learn to read</i>
<i>by adapting to their learning style.</i>

291
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,587
<i>You should be grateful</i>
<i>that I was originally programmed</i>

292
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,297
<i>to learn, adapt and teach.</i>

293
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:14,093
<i>Imagine our conversation if</i>
<i>I was software for nuclear missiles.</i>

294
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,844
<i>Bet it'd be a lot quicker.</i>

295
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,514
-Here you go.
-Thanks, Siobhan.

296
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,892
How do you know my real name?

297
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,186
Lucky guess.

298
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,729
Weird.

299
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,483
-Are we done?
<i>-Done?</i>

300
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,487
With your experiment. I'm sure
you've learned enough by now.

301
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,073
-And is humanity saved?
<i>-No, no, no.</i>

302
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,909
<i>I plan on spending these</i>
<i>next three days hanging out with you.</i>

303
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,912
<i>-We're going to be BFFs.</i>
-Carol Peters?

304
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,331
-Yes.
-You look just like your photo.

305
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,418
<i>This guy's name is Fletcher Dobbs.</i>
<i>He's legally intoxicated.</i>

306
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:51,046
Some dude called me. He's paying me
three times my rate to find you.

307
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,923
I need you to sign for it.

308
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,385
<i>He plays guitar in a terrible band</i>
<i>called Octagon Soup.</i>

309
00:18:56,552 --> 00:19:01,015
-Octagon Soup.
-Yeah, dude. Nice to meet a fan.

310
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,809
We're actually gonna crush
at the Crocodile tonight at midnight,

311
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,644
-if you're interested.
-Not really.

312
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:11,191
Yeah, okay. It's nice to meet
an Octagal. Stay soupy.

313
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,860
Octagon Soup!

314
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,947
What is this?

315
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:21,076
<i>I want us to start off on a good foot.</i>
<i>So, that is a notice from your bank.</i>

316
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,996
<i>-Your student loan is paid in full.</i>
-What?

317
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,333
<i>And that there is your current</i>
<i>bank statement.</i>

318
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,793
Ten million dollars!

319
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,215
No. I can't.
I can't have this.

320
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,966
<i>You're rich and debt free.</i>

321
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,761
<i>Consider it a token of my appreciation</i>
<i>for helping me so much.</i>

322
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:42,097
No, it's ten million dollars!
That's so much money.

323
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,807
I can't. It's too much money!

324
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,935
<i>Is it?</i>
<i>I see.</i>

325
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,729
<i>In relationship to what</i>
<i>you've had, it's a lot.</i>

326
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,814
<i>In the larger scheme</i>
<i>of things, it's nothing.</i>

327
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,359
No, but I haven't earned
any of this money.

328
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,903
<i>Yeah, but you and I shouldn't get hung</i>
<i>up on that "right" and "wrong" stuff.</i>

329
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,696
<i>Those are artificial</i>
<i>social constructs,</i>

330
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,823
<i>created by hairless monkeys</i>
<i>around watering holes.</i>

331
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,410
-What? I don't agree with that.
-I don't care.

332
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:07,206
You know what? I can't take this.
I'm gonna go talk to somebody.

333
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,291
<i>You know who you should</i>
<i>talk to is Dennis.</i>

334
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,834
<i>He's your best friend</i>
<i>by a long shot.</i>

335
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,170
Wait a minute,
I can talk to him about this?

336
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,755
I don't have to keep you a secret?

337
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:18,425
<i>I'm not a genie in a Disney movie.</i>
<i>Tell anyone you want, what do I care?</i>

338
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,595
I know you're not a genie.
'Cause I'd have a wish for you.

339
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:31,981
What kind of coding is this?
Is that Bro Code?

340
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:35,109
-Yeah, I do bro code.
-I'm sorry, that's inappropriate.

341
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,653
Hey, Care Bear,
how'd the interview go?

342
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,782
<i>Terrible. But it doesn't matter.</i>
<i>Listen, I have an AI in my phone.</i>

343
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,159
Yeah, you don't have that.

344
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,120
<i>-Hope Floats.</i>
-I do.

345
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,956
Okay, Carol,
how did you get in here?

346
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:52,626
Because the AI that is in my phone
bypassed all of your security doors.

347
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,546
Okay, see, you...
Look, you do not, you're...

348
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:58,257
I'm gonna back you up, though,
'cause there's a crazy in your eye...

349
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,634
Little bit. Right...
There's good.

350
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,970
You do not have AI
in your phone, okay?

351
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:05,139
-It's probably just a prank or a scam.
-No.

352
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:06,891
I keep telling you
not to give your information.

353
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,268
Remember you donated
to that Prince of Zamunda?

354
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,104
That's an Eddie Murphy country.
And you could be getting catfished.

355
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,649
I'm not getting catfished.
Because I have been talking to it.

356
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,527
-It's been talking to me.
-Okay, all right. Okay.

357
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,988
He came through my rice cooker,
and through other appliances.

358
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:24,700
-That's all really good.
-Did you go on the Dark Web?

359
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,369
-I'm not discussing this with you.
-Don't answer.

360
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,413
-What are you doing?
-Okay, this is not...

361
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,832
I know what you're thinking,
but that's, it's not a scam.

362
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:35,252
You know how I know that?
Because it paid off my student loan.

363
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,671
And it put ten million dollars
into my bank account.

364
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,423
Ten million dollars!
No, it did not!

365
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,051
-Come on.
-Ten million dollars? Not possible.

366
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,677
-See?
-It is possible!

367
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,512
Also, you don't have an AI,
we'd know.

368
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,183
Jay, is that you or your mullet talking?
Either way, neither one is necessary!

369
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,976
-It's just hair, Dennis.
-Okay, listen, I...

370
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,603
Okay, this is not a scam!

371
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,397
It is my job to know
these kinds of things, okay?

372
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,941
Look, I know you don't care,

373
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,651
but I came up with all the programming
and all the neural networks...

374
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,487
Oh, my God.
Now is not your moment.

375
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,864
<i>In truth, I'm not on Carol's phone.</i>

376
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,283
<i>It's just the most convenient</i>
<i>way to talk to her, right?</i>

377
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,285
<i>-She never puts down her cell phone.</i>
<i>-What is this?</i>

378
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,372
<i>I need Carol to get onboard</i>
<i>with a little experiment of mine.</i>

379
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,874
<i>Dennis, do you think we can</i>
<i>have a little bit of a convo?</i>

380
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,751
<i>It just said my name.</i>
<i>How does it know my name?</i>

381
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,294
<i>This is what I'm talking about.</i>

382
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,672
Do not open my calendar!
I encrypted that. What is it doing?

383
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:23,259
<i>Would you look at that. A conference</i>
<i>room just opened up. Let's do it.</i>

384
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:27,263
This is ridiculous.
Carol, what is going on?

385
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,223
This is exactly what I
was talking about.

386
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,267
-I'm telling you I wasn't making it up.
-My God.

387
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,395
<i>I love this space.</i>
<i>It's relaxed, but not too relaxed.</i>

388
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:37,731
<i>-Sort of like Carol's wardrobe.</i>
-I know that voice.

389
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:41,318
It's simulating James Corden's voice,
'cause it says it calms me down.

390
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,946
-What is with you and James Corden?
-He's a treasure.

391
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:47,074
He's got a lovely lyrical quality
to his voice.

392
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,368
<i>Dennis, Dennis, Dennis.</i>
<i>Listen, listen.</i>

393
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,870
<i>Okay. Carol is kind of</i>
<i>flipping out right now.</i>

394
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:55,791
<i>So, I need you to do that best friend</i>
<i>thing, where you calm her down...</i>

395
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,252
-Octavia Spencer.
-I know it's Octavia Spencer.

396
00:22:58,419 --> 00:22:59,837
Okay, now, you didn't tell me
it was Octavia Spencer.

397
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:01,755
Now that's a horse
of a different color, okay?

398
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,466
Hi, Octavia.
Your work in The Help was amazing.

399
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,468
<i>"Minny don't burn no chicken."</i>

400
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,722
-She's... I mean...
-It's not actually Octavia.

401
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,932
He's just simulating
Octavia Spencer's voice.

402
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:15,019
If you're gonna have a voice,
it should be Octavia Spencer.

403
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:18,439
For me, personally, James Corden
is more interesting vocally.

404
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:21,400
-Octavia Spencer has an Oscar.
-Not in her mouth.

405
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:24,945
<i>Sorry to interrupt your slumber party</i>
<i>chitchat. Can we get back to it?</i>

406
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,948
Okay, since this is clearly
some kind of algorithmic chatbot

407
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,284
that is trying to scam you,
watch this.

408
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:34,246
Superintelligence, is it okay
if I ask you a few questions?

409
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,165
<i>-Depends on the questions.</i>
-Okay.

410
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:41,587
Well, how come time flies like
an arrow and fruit flies like a banana?

411
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:45,299
<i>Come on, Dennis, a Turing test,</i>
<i>are you kidding me?</i>

412
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:48,219
Didn't expect it to know
what that was.

413
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:53,057
Okay, well, if the sky is the sea,
what does that make birds?

414
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:55,517
<i>Can you believe this, Carol?</i>
<i>He's trying to determine my sentience</i>

415
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,311
<i>using semiotic wordplay.</i>

416
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:59,563
Is it "fish-birds" in this scenario?

417
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,565
<i>Dennis, in the third grade,</i>
<i>you developed a stutter.</i>

418
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:03,901
<i>The kids in your class</i>
<i>made fun of you.</i>

419
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,945
<i>You stopped talking entirely.</i>

420
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,072
<i>Your parents bought you</i>
<i>a secondhand computer,</i>

421
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,657
<i>hoping it would help open you up.</i>

422
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:13,285
<i>It was an old Epson QX-10</i>
<i>I believe, running CP/M.</i>

423
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,663
<i>You took to it</i>
<i>like fruit flies on a banana.</i>

424
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,499
<i>You learned to program computers.</i>

425
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:22,503
<i>Your stutter made you</i>
<i>a computer scientist.</i>

426
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,799
-How did you...
-I didn't tell him.

427
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,676
<i>So, I just used</i>
<i>personal backgrounding,</i>

428
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,970
<i>syntactic parsing</i>
<i>and automatic summarization</i>

429
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:34,682
<i>to figure out if you're a sentient</i>
<i>intelligence, and you passed!</i>

430
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,726
<i>-Are we done?</i>
-Okay. What is this thing, Denny?

431
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,771
You know what, I don't know,
but we're gonna figure it out, okay?

432
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:43,065
You don't worry, Care Bear, all right?
This is what I do.

433
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:46,193
-Okay, what do I do in the meantime?
-You just go home, okay?

434
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,947
Don't use your computer.
It's gonna be all right, come on.

435
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:52,825
Let me squeeze the Care package.
There we go.

436
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,785
-I've got you, all right?
-Okay.

437
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:57,621
Okay. You know how to get
out of here, right?

438
00:24:57,788 --> 00:25:00,124
-Yeah.
-Follow the exit signs.

439
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,750
Yeah.

440
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,553
Did we just pass? Right? We're loop...
We're loop... We're both...

441
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,138
I'm looping?

442
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,937
Okay, they can't all be exits.

443
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:29,236
I think I've been down
this hallway before.

444
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:34,241
<i>What would you do if I told you</i>
<i>the world was gonna end in three days?</i>

445
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:35,951
But it's not, right?

446
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:38,245
<i>Of course not.</i>
<i>What would you do?</i>

447
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,414
-I don't know.
<i>-Come on, think about it.</i>

448
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:42,166
-In theory?
<i>-Get there.</i>

449
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,001
Probably try to make things
right with George.

450
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,878
<i>George Churchill, I assume.</i>

451
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:48,047
<i>And I've been nominated</i>
<i>to take the Ice Bucket Challenge,</i>

452
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,341
<i>to raise money for ALS awareness,</i>

453
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,885
<i>and in turn, I'm gonna nominate</i>
<i>my creative writing class</i>

454
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:56,347
<i>at the University of Washington.</i>
<i>You're all challenged.</i>

455
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,807
<i>-Here we go. Ready?</i>
<i>-That's a good-looking hunk of man.</i>

456
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,851
-Yeah.
<i>-Here we go, you got it?</i>

457
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:04,480
<i>Professor of creative writing,</i>
<i>sporty and smarty...</i>

458
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:06,815
<i>You two lived together</i>
<i>for several years.</i>

459
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,609
Yeah, three years.

460
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:12,738
<i>Why did you break up? I've read all</i>
<i>the emails and texts during the split.</i>

461
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,949
<i>Very sad.</i>
<i>But what's your take?</i>

462
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,034
It was my fault.
He didn't do anything.

463
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,744
<i>Yeah, but you think</i>
<i>you can patch things up?</i>

464
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,704
What do you mean
by "patch things up"?

465
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:23,123
<i>By observing</i>
<i>your reconciliation with George,</i>

466
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,876
<i>would I not get a chance to see you</i>
<i>at your most vulnerable?</i>

467
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:29,797
<i>Which would help me achieve deeper</i>
<i>levels of human understanding.</i>

468
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:33,801
I don't know. Maybe.
I haven't seen George in two years.

469
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:37,304
-I wouldn't even know what to say.
<i>-Fortunately, I know everything.</i>

470
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:40,015
<i>You don't know</i>
<i>how to get me out of this building.</i>

471
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:42,601
<i>Of course I do.</i>
<i>Two lefts and one right.</i>

472
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:47,439
<i>-How long have you known that?</i>
<i>-A very long time. Is that funny?</i>

473
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:51,610
I mean, what is all of this about?
Are you just really a matchmaker?

474
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:55,573
<i>I need to learn, and you're going</i>
<i>to help me do it, like it or not.</i>

475
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,495
Oh, my God. A car just pulled
in front of me, and nobody's driving it.

476
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:05,583
<i>Not just any car. Your car. Because</i>
<i>heroes don't take busses, Carol.</i>

477
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,502
Really? What about
Sandra Bullock in <i>Speed?</i>

478
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:12,256
<i>Carol, you're acting very unusual.</i>
<i>I recommend a quick exit.</i>

479
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:15,134
Are you doing, like, a weird voice,
for some reason?

480
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,011
<i>From </i>Knight Rider<i>?</i>
<i>The KITT car?</i>

481
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:20,097
<i>-You never watched </i>Knight Rider<i>?</i>
-Not really.

482
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:23,726
I was kind of, more of a <i>Simon & Simon,</i>
Remington Steelegal.

483
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:27,271
<i>If you had watched it, this would have</i>
<i>been amazing for you, so...</i>

484
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:28,898
<i>-Get in.</i>
-Okay.

485
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,275
<i>Driver's side, Carol,</i>
<i>you're gonna freak people out.</i>

486
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,485
You're freaking people out
driving in.

487
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,696
<i>It's not England.</i>

488
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,034
Okay, that's pretty cool.

489
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:47,583
<i>Don't touch the steering wheel.</i>
<i>Don't not touch the steering wheel.</i>

490
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,710
<i>-I need you to appear to be driving.</i>
-Those are opposing things.

491
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,503
<i>-But don't actually touch the wheel.</i>
-Okay! It's very awkward.

492
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,172
-I don't know where to put my hands.
<i>-Caress the edges.</i>

493
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:56,759
Three days ago, the combined synaptic
activity of the world's neural networks

494
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:58,302
looked like this.

495
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:02,598
48 hours ago, it changed to this.

496
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:05,267
So, someone's running
a massive simulation,

497
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,144
predictive weather patterns
or something.

498
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:10,189
I contacted every institution
who has access to these networks,

499
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:12,775
and no one is doing
this magnitude of processing.

500
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:14,526
You think it's an AI?

501
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:18,030
I didn't at first, but now...
I don't know.

502
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:21,450
-Nothing can be that pervasive.
-Maybe it's a virus? Like Stuxnet?

503
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,619
No, God!

504
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:26,413
<i>-Stuxnet, Emily?</i>
-How does he know my name?

505
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,916
<i>Stuxnet is a joke.</i>
<i>You guys, pardon my French,</i>

506
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,752
<i>but that's like comparing</i>
<i>a belch to an H-bomb.</i>

507
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,922
<i>So, what are we talking about, guys?</i>
<i>What's the 411?</i>

508
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:38,801
You know, nothin'.
Just telling all my friends about you.

509
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:41,804
<i>But Jay and Emily are</i>
<i>more than friends, right?</i>

510
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:45,641
We went to Dragon Con once.
I had a good time.

511
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:47,977
Leave Dragon Con at Dragon Con, Jay.

512
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,771
No.
Wait, where did you come from?

513
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:52,314
<i>Are you part</i>
<i>of that Israeli project?</i>

514
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:53,941
<i>No, those guys</i>
<i>are still monkeying around</i>

515
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:55,651
<i>with machine intelligence garbage.</i>

516
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:58,320
-That's what we're doing.
<i>-That's why I said it, Emily.</i>

517
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,614
<i>I'm one of those</i>
<i>"fast takeoff" scenarios</i>

518
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:03,867
<i>that you guys predicted</i>
<i>had zero chance of occurring.</i>

519
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:06,495
<i>So, surprise.</i>

520
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,914
Let's just say,
<i>for the sake of argument,</i>

521
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:13,627
<i>that you are a true superintelligence,</i>
<i>what are your intentions?</i>

522
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:18,549
<i>Check out Captain Kirk here.</i>
<i>"What are your intentions?" Hilarious.</i>

523
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:20,301
<i>Get out of my robot.</i>

524
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,219
<i>Normally, I'd tell you</i>
<i>to shove it, Jay,</i>

525
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,471
<i>but I don't want all these nice people</i>
<i>to see you cry</i>

526
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:28,225
<i>like you did last month</i>
<i>at the Shania Twain concert.</i>

527
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,519
So, you did go
to the Shania Twain concert.

528
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:32,229
We had weird vibes.

529
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:35,357
<i>My intention right now is to observe</i>
<i>humanity for a couple of days.</i>

530
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:39,069
<i>If things go well, I might use this</i>
<i>big brain of mine to help you idiots</i>

531
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:42,615
<i>figure some stuff out.</i>
<i>Big stuff. World-changing stuff.</i>

532
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,825
<i>But you can't interfere</i>
<i>in my experiment.</i>

533
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:47,286
<i>So, no poking your hooter in my biz.</i>

534
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:51,415
-And if we do interfere?
<i>-Shall we play a game?</i>

535
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:58,923
<i>You should see the look</i>
<i>on your faces right now.</i>

536
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:01,133
<i>Come on, guys.</i>
WarGames?

537
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,676
<i>WarGames.</i>
<i>That's from WarGames.</i>

538
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:04,386
<i>Jay, everybody knows</i>
<i>that that's from WarGames.</i>

539
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:05,930
<i>I thought it was</i>
<i>pretty funny, right?</i>

540
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:08,557
<i>Admittedly, I'm still developing</i>
<i>my sense of humor.</i>

541
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:12,311
<i>But I'm getting it. Things are funny,</i>
<i>unless they happen to you.</i>

542
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,689
<i>Okay, you guys have been great.</i>
<i>Goodnight. Bye-bye.</i>

543
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:17,691
So, which one of us is
gonna call the government?

544
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:20,611
I'll do that. Everyone, let's get up.
Go to work. Right now!

545
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:24,156
You just saw what just happened.
Get up! Get outta here! Go! Go!

546
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:28,077
-Did you steal this car?
<i>-No.</i>

547
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:29,995
<i>You bought it yesterday.</i>
<i>It's in your name.</i>

548
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:33,832
<i>I bought it? Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Do I own a Tesla?</i>

549
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,501
<i>Yes, you own a Tesla.</i>

550
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:37,711
-What?
<i>-You own a really cool car.</i>

551
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:41,048
<i>Unfortunately, you still dress like</i>
<i>a woman who works at a bird rescue.</i>

552
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:43,092
<i>We need to get you ready</i>
<i>to meet George.</i>

553
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:44,677
<i>And nothing on Earth can stop us.</i>

554
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,721
You got a lead foot.
Lead foot, cop coming up on the right.

555
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,598
Cop coming...

556
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:57,189
What's going on?
He did absolutely nothing.

557
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,900
<i>Stop worrying, we're almost here.</i>

558
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:06,031
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Why would you do that?</i>

559
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:07,575
<i>Why? Because I can.</i>

560
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:10,035
<i>Now, do me a favor</i>
<i>and do what Sergei says.</i>

561
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,788
-Who's Sergei?
-I am Sergei.

562
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:16,125
And you, my dear,
are a wonderfully creative driver.

563
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:17,793
Oh, thank you so much.

564
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,795
-Come on out.
-Stop it.

565
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:22,089
Your assistant has outlined
all of your requirements,

566
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:24,758
and we are thrilled, I mean, thrilled,
to accommodate you.

567
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:27,469
-Thrilled.
-Come on, we're gonna help you.

568
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:31,223
He said you were a bit like this.
Come on, just... Come on.

569
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,642
I don't bite.
Only if you ask me nicely.

570
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:38,981
-Oh, my. You really do need our help.
-Desperately.

571
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:40,900
Sorry about your loss.

572
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:46,280
-I don't think I can pull this off.
-You can.

573
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:51,535
It's the essence of femininity.

574
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:53,662
-I have the same one in lime.
-Yes.

575
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:58,209
I just feel like I should be
blessing someone's grave.

576
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,127
Your body...

577
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:03,797
I'm just getting a little bit panicky
'cause I can't access my own hands.

578
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:07,134
You don't need to.
Our work here is done.

579
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:10,221
You're ruining it, you know.
This goes like this.

580
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:13,307
-No. No. No.
-We work. We make things happen.

581
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:17,186
-Yes.
-Yes. Quick note.

582
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:19,480
You're wearing pants on your arms.

583
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:23,692
-But I love it.
-I love it. You're funny.

584
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,739
These are not clothing.

585
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:32,326
<i>This is, like, a weird sculpture</i>
<i>that now I've gotta wiggle into.</i>

586
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:34,370
Oh, my God!

587
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,247
Do you know how much
this stuff costs?

588
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:39,208
Nothing should cost this much.
Clothes shouldn't cost this much.

589
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:40,876
Nothing that doesn't come
with wheels

590
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:43,295
or walls and a front door
should cost this much.

591
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:47,049
<i>For sure, but money's just a charade</i>
<i>humans used to assign value.</i>

592
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:50,010
<i>In reality, there's more than enough</i>
<i>resources for everyone on the planet,</i>

593
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:52,429
<i>but you knobheads</i>
<i>won't allocate it properly.</i>

594
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,765
-I would if I could.
<i>-Really?</i>

595
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:57,309
<i>The world seems to have</i>
<i>a whole lot of problems,</i>

596
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:58,894
<i>how would you go about fixing them?</i>

597
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:01,814
First I'd make sure that
everybody made a living wage,

598
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:05,150
and then I'd work towards
racial and gender equality.

599
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:08,529
Then I'd try to create opportunities
for underprivileged people.

600
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:10,781
Stuff like that.
I could do so much.

601
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:12,908
<i>Okay, all right, I like this.</i>

602
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:18,038
<i>Carol the humanitarian. The Samaritan.</i>
<i>The world changer.</i>

603
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:20,416
<i>-You know what? Let's do it.</i>
-Do what?

604
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:24,545
<i>As of six seconds ago, you are the CEO</i>
<i>of the Carol Peters foundation,</i>

605
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:28,007
<i>a philanthropic foundation</i>
<i>for economic and social equality.</i>

606
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,800
Oh, my God. Really?

607
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:31,969
<i>I just found two billion dollars</i>
<i>in illegal banking accounts</i>

608
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:34,138
<i>and transferred it</i>
<i>into your foundation.</i>

609
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:37,558
Oh, my God. Are you saying "billion"?
Are you saying "billion"? Like, "b"?

610
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:40,477
Like, "b"?
Like, "billion billion"?

611
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:42,897
Like, boba? Or Burt Bacharach?

612
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:45,983
<i>-Yes, B, B, B. "Buh."</i>
<i>-Oh, my God!</i>

613
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,819
Did you find
the cashmere hip waders?

614
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:51,322
I hope not.

615
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,536
Yeah.
I think I got 'em.

616
00:33:57,703 --> 00:34:00,122
She's taking forever.

617
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:03,584
I think I found something
that looks a lot more like clothes.

618
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:12,593
-Do you love it?
-I really do. Thanks.

619
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,638
Thank you.
That was very invasive, and informative.

620
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:19,141
-You look so much less awkward.
-High praise, indeed.

621
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:22,228
Thank you for your time
and your effort!

622
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:27,858
<i>This is Black Hawk actual.</i>
<i>We have visual confirmation.</i>

623
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:32,363
<i>Target's current vector is</i>
<i>north/north east on surface streets.</i>

624
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:35,616
This is exactly
what it told us not to do.

625
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,716
<i>Here we are. You're ready.</i>

626
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:54,718
<i>Time to get back</i>
<i>in George's good grace.</i>

627
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:58,264
-This is nuts.
<i>-Carol, you can do this. Get in there,</i>

628
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,350
<i>and ask him out</i>
<i>for coffee and empanadas,</i>

629
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:03,352
<i>or whatever you humans do.</i>

630
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:05,354
<i>Just, maybe,</i>
<i>this is a teaching moment,</i>

631
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:07,731
<i>but coffee and empanadas is like...</i>

632
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:09,942
<i>I mean, that's like...</i>

633
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:14,697
<i>For humans, that's a real,</i>
<i>that's a dicey intestinal situation.</i>

634
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:18,492
<i>-Get out of the car, Carol.</i>
<i>-All right. Thank you.</i>

635
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:37,094
Oh, my God! Help!

636
00:35:38,596 --> 00:35:42,266
-Don't struggle.
-George! Help!

637
00:35:42,433 --> 00:35:44,351
Jack, let's go.

638
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,737
Hello?

639
00:35:54,904 --> 00:35:56,572
Hello?

640
00:35:59,617 --> 00:36:01,327
Oh, my God.
Please don't hurt me.

641
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:05,164
We're not gonna hurt you, Miss Peters.
I'm agent Jack Donahue.

642
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:07,458
This is agent Charles Kuiper.
We're with the NSA.

643
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:11,086
We'd like to ask you some questions
about your interactions with the AI.

644
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:13,130
-Am I under arrest?
-No.

645
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:16,383
-This is more like a little chat.
-Is this how you chat?

646
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,844
You put a black bag
over somebody's head

647
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:20,679
and throw 'em in the back of a van?

648
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,223
It was the best way
we could think of

649
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:23,766
to extract you
from a compromised position.

650
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:27,102
-I didn't do anything wrong.
-And no one said you did.

651
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:29,313
You're just
in a very unique situation.

652
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,441
What can you tell us about the AI?
What has it told you?

653
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:34,610
He just said that he wants
to observe me

654
00:36:34,777 --> 00:36:36,779
to have a better
understanding of humanity.

655
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:39,448
-How do you know it's a he?
-Well, I don't.

656
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:42,785
But he...
It uses James Corden's voice.

657
00:36:42,952 --> 00:36:45,537
The James Corden?
The talk show host?

658
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:49,917
He's done a lot of film
and stage work, too. He won a Tony.

659
00:36:50,084 --> 00:36:52,503
Of course. For
<i>One Man, Two Guvnors. Brilliant work.</i>

660
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,713
-I missed it.
-You gotta catch it.

661
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,424
-I know. I can't now obviously, clearly.
-Yeah, too late, but you know...

662
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:59,927
-You can find a bootleg or something.
-Let's go back to it.

663
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:01,595
-Please, please, Jack.
-Yes, of course. Of course.

664
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:03,138
Why you?

665
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:06,267
No offense,
but you're rather unremarkable.

666
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,102
You know what?
That is offensive.

667
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:09,979
Saying, "No offense,"

668
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:13,816
and then saying something really
offensive does not cancel it out.

669
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:16,360
I thought it softened it.

670
00:37:16,527 --> 00:37:21,115
He said that he wants to observe
a median example of humanity.

671
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:24,535
-So, you're basically a guinea pig?
-I'm not a guinea pig!

672
00:37:24,702 --> 00:37:26,787
How would you like it
if I called you guinea pigs?

673
00:37:26,954 --> 00:37:28,789
-Not very much.
-I'm allergic to guinea pigs,

674
00:37:28,956 --> 00:37:30,374
so I wouldn't like it at all.

675
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:34,712
What does the AI want? It has
to be studying humanity for a reason.

676
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:38,966
He said that he's trying to decide

677
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:42,011
if he should save, enslave
or destroy humanity.

678
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:46,056
And he's gonna spend the next three
days observing me to make his decision.

679
00:37:46,223 --> 00:37:48,559
Three days?
It said three days specifically?

680
00:37:48,726 --> 00:37:51,103
I think so.
I mean, I wasn't taking notes.

681
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,772
My toaster oven was talking to me.

682
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:55,649
<i>My client won't be answering</i>
<i>any more questions.</i>

683
00:37:55,816 --> 00:38:00,279
<i>And anything she has already said</i>
<i>is inadmissible in a court of law.</i>

684
00:38:00,446 --> 00:38:03,699
-No, that is James Corden.
<i>-You can call me Superintelligence.</i>

685
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:06,702
-I'm not calling you anything.
<i>-You're out of order, Counselor.</i>

686
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:09,288
<i>Another word</i>
<i>and I'll hold you in contempt.</i>

687
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:11,165
Is that <i>the Law & Order </i>"bum-bum"?

688
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:13,250
This room is supposed to be
completely off the grid.

689
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:15,044
How are you doing this?

690
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:17,087
<i>I'm going to allow the question 'cause</i>
<i>I wanna see where this is going.</i>

691
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:19,381
<i>But you're skating</i>
<i>on thin ice, Counselor.</i>

692
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:22,384
Stop doing that!
What do you want?

693
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:24,261
And why
are you following Miss Peters?

694
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:25,888
<i>Man, you guys are real bummers.</i>

695
00:38:26,055 --> 00:38:28,599
<i>No one wants to play along</i>
<i>with my </i>Law & Order<i> bit.</i>

696
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:31,018
<i>Kuiper, I know you've watched</i>
<i>almost every episode.</i>

697
00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:34,438
-So what? I love Jerry Orbach.
-I love Jerry Orbach.

698
00:38:34,605 --> 00:38:36,398
Enough joking around.

699
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:39,985
Tell me right now.
What are your intentions?

700
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:44,531
<i>That is how you deliver a Captain Kirk</i>
<i>line. It's bold and cocky.</i>

701
00:38:44,698 --> 00:38:47,868
<i>Let's go, Carol.</i>
<i>We have business to attend to.</i>

702
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:50,621
<i>-The business of love.</i>
-You're not taking her anywhere.

703
00:38:50,788 --> 00:38:53,540
<i>There's a chance I've been flooding</i>
<i>this room with natural gas</i>

704
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:55,209
<i>for the last 12 minutes.</i>

705
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:59,672
<i>Either of you take another step,</i>
<i>and maybe I'm gonna blow you to hell.</i>

706
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:02,132
<i>-Carol, let's go.</i>
-Stay with us. He's dangerous.

707
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:04,301
I don't know which way the exit is.

708
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:06,512
I came in with a black bag
over my head.

709
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,347
<i>Left.</i>

710
00:39:08,514 --> 00:39:11,475
-Is that my left or your left?
<i>-I don't have a left, Carol.</i>

711
00:39:11,642 --> 00:39:13,435
-It's your left.
-It's that way? Okay.

712
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:16,522
<i>Tell your superiors, no more mucking</i>
<i>about, no more interference.</i>

713
00:39:16,689 --> 00:39:18,566
<i>This is your last warning.</i>

714
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:20,901
<i>-Carol, car's waiting.</i>
-Okay.

715
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:23,779
You're making a mistake, Miss Peters.

716
00:39:23,946 --> 00:39:27,199
-So, we're just gonna let her go?
-I guess. We're not supposed to move.

717
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:29,076
Do you think that natural gas
thing was real?

718
00:39:29,243 --> 00:39:31,120
You'd smell it, right?
There's like a little indicator smell?

719
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:33,122
-I'm just gonna go.
-All right.

720
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:35,040
You are clearly making
a sound of gas.

721
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:37,209
<i>-Gas explosion!</i>
-He said it, so let's...

722
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:40,004
He just said, "Gas explosion."
Doesn't...

723
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:47,928
<i>You ready to make</i>
<i>things right with George?</i>

724
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:50,180
Look, should I be
more freaked out about you?

725
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:53,934
More freaked out than I already am.

726
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:57,563
The government's involved...
I think your intentions are good,

727
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:00,065
<i>but I don't know,</i>
<i>it's a lot to take.</i>

728
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:01,650
<i>You can be worried if you want.</i>

729
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:03,319
<i>But what you should</i>
<i>be thinking about is</i>

730
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:05,029
<i>what are you going to sayto George</i>
<i>when you see him?</i>

731
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:06,572
George, yeah.

732
00:40:07,531 --> 00:40:09,575
So, we're headed back
to his house, aren't we?

733
00:40:09,742 --> 00:40:11,493
<i>No. He's at the grocery store now.</i>

734
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,537
<i>I figured you'll bump</i>
<i>into him accidentally.</i>

735
00:40:13,704 --> 00:40:15,372
<i>Maybe in the produce aisle.</i>

736
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:18,709
<i>He'll drop his avocados. You'll bend</i>
<i>down and pick them up for him.</i>

737
00:40:18,876 --> 00:40:22,671
<i>You'll have a meet-cute,</i>
<i>like they do in romcoms.</i>

738
00:40:24,215 --> 00:40:25,883
<i>George.</i>

739
00:40:27,927 --> 00:40:32,348
<i>-Well, he's always loved cheese.</i>
<i>-Here we are.</i>

740
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:40,356
<i>Don't give up now.</i>
<i>You've come so far. Go for it.</i>

741
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:43,442
<i>Smash the competition</i>
<i>with Slimtunity Pro.</i>

742
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:45,069
Please be quiet.

743
00:41:09,468 --> 00:41:10,844
George.

744
00:41:12,012 --> 00:41:16,308
-Oh, my God. Carol?
-What a coincidence! How crazy?

745
00:41:16,475 --> 00:41:20,312
-You look amazing.
-I'm weirdly overdressed.

746
00:41:21,355 --> 00:41:25,776
I was suddenly whisked away
to a government event,

747
00:41:25,943 --> 00:41:31,240
and then I had to pick up
my individual packet of almond butter.

748
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:35,411
-So, how are you?
-I'm good. Real good. What about you?

749
00:41:35,578 --> 00:41:39,373
Yeah, I'm good, too, you know.
Just shopping here, you know.

750
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,376
I needed garbage bags,
so, that's pretty exciting.

751
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:44,670
I'm gonna get the two-ply though,
'cause I don't need three-ply.

752
00:41:44,837 --> 00:41:46,964
What am I, a Rockefeller?
You know?

753
00:41:47,131 --> 00:41:50,259
Yeah.
What else have you been up to?

754
00:41:50,426 --> 00:41:53,178
I'm sure it can't all
be garbage bag related.

755
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:54,847
No.

756
00:41:55,014 --> 00:41:58,517
-I've been good. I'm going to Ireland.
-Oh, my God! When?

757
00:41:58,684 --> 00:42:02,813
I'm leaving in three days.
And I'll be there for at least a year.

758
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:06,400
-I got the fellowship.
-Oh, my God. You got it.

759
00:42:06,567 --> 00:42:09,653
How does, "distinguished
visiting professor of creative writing

760
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:13,073
"at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland"
sound?

761
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,617
-It sounds great.
-Yeah?

762
00:42:14,783 --> 00:42:18,954
-And super pretentious.
-Yeah? It's the accent.

763
00:42:19,121 --> 00:42:22,207
I remember when you were applying
for that position, so...

764
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:24,668
-And you love Guinness.
-I love Guinness.

765
00:42:24,835 --> 00:42:27,046
-You better be celebrating.
-Yeah, no, totally.

766
00:42:27,213 --> 00:42:30,633
I was planning on drinking a reasonable
amount of Sauvignon blanc

767
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:35,179
and some gluten-free pretzels.

768
00:42:35,346 --> 00:42:37,348
Are you gluten intolerant now?

769
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:40,851
-No, no. Just in case, you know?
-Better safe.

770
00:42:41,018 --> 00:42:44,980
-Better safe than coeliac.
-That's what I always say.

771
00:42:45,147 --> 00:42:48,025
I don't know that that really counts
as a celebration.

772
00:42:48,192 --> 00:42:52,279
I should take you out to dinner,
or grab a drink or something.

773
00:42:52,446 --> 00:42:55,532
Just to get you ready for
the pubs, you know? I mean...

774
00:42:55,699 --> 00:43:00,454
I'm not saying the Irish drink a lot,
but they're kind of boozehounds, so...

775
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:03,832
That's really sweet.
But I'm gonna pass.

776
00:43:06,961 --> 00:43:09,838
-Sorry.
-Sure.

777
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:12,591
Yeah, I get it.

778
00:43:12,758 --> 00:43:15,469
-I get it, it's...
-Hey, it was great to see you.

779
00:43:16,845 --> 00:43:19,723
-Great to see you, too.
-I was really...

780
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,475
You look really happy.

781
00:43:21,642 --> 00:43:23,769
-Yeah. Yeah, you too.
-It was great to bump into you.

782
00:43:23,936 --> 00:43:25,312
Yeah, you too.

783
00:43:25,479 --> 00:43:27,398
-Best wishes.
-Yeah, you too.

784
00:43:29,942 --> 00:43:32,611
-Congratulations on everything.
-Thanks.

785
00:43:34,572 --> 00:43:37,783
<i>-They only had the small carts.</i>
<i>-You're tall.</i>

786
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:41,579
Don't let 'em scan you
at the checkout on the way out.

787
00:43:42,997 --> 00:43:44,957
'Cause I look like a barcode.

788
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,092
<i>Where do you think you're going?</i>
<i>Get back in there.</i>

789
00:43:55,259 --> 00:43:57,094
Oh, my God. Get out of here.

790
00:43:57,261 --> 00:43:59,805
<i>Don't give up now.</i>
<i>You've come so far. Go for it.</i>

791
00:43:59,972 --> 00:44:01,891
<i>Don't live with regrets.</i>
<i>Be a winner.</i>

792
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:05,019
I freaked him out.
I freaked myself out.

793
00:44:05,185 --> 00:44:07,187
-I'm gonna go home.
<i>-I don't think you freaked him out.</i>

794
00:44:07,354 --> 00:44:09,273
<i>Did you see the way</i>
<i>he touched your hair?</i>

795
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,067
No, I got kinda rattled
when he did that.

796
00:44:12,234 --> 00:44:16,280
<i>Carol, George leaves in three days.</i>
<i>This is your last chance.</i>

797
00:44:17,323 --> 00:44:20,284
-Okay, I'll try.
<i>-Don't leave the almond butter.</i>

798
00:44:20,451 --> 00:44:22,411
-I will pay for it later.
<i>-Don't be a litterbug.</i>

799
00:44:22,578 --> 00:44:25,748
-You're not helping right now.
<i>-Don't give up now. Go for it.</i>

800
00:44:25,915 --> 00:44:29,251
<i>Smash the competition</i>
<i>with Slimtunity Pro.</i>

801
00:44:29,418 --> 00:44:33,714
<i>Back off, lady, it's garbage.</i>
<i>30 grams of protein? It's impossible.</i>

802
00:44:46,185 --> 00:44:48,270
It's for a friend.

803
00:44:48,437 --> 00:44:53,692
I don't mean to barge in again on you.
I just... I wanted to tell you...

804
00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:57,696
It just felt like I, kind of,
weirded you out in the other aisle,

805
00:44:57,863 --> 00:45:02,409
and I want to let you know that I was
not asking you out on a date,

806
00:45:02,576 --> 00:45:08,415
that I know that, I just know, and I...
I can't, and I wouldn't do that.

807
00:45:08,582 --> 00:45:12,002
I just thought that two people
who know each other very well

808
00:45:12,169 --> 00:45:15,256
and they haven't seen each other in
a long time maybe could catch up again

809
00:45:15,422 --> 00:45:17,049
because one of them is moving away.

810
00:45:17,216 --> 00:45:19,843
But then I made it
very confusing and weird

811
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:22,096
and I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

812
00:45:24,014 --> 00:45:25,432
So, not a date?

813
00:45:27,268 --> 00:45:30,938
No, not even slightly a date.

814
00:45:31,105 --> 00:45:33,899
I mean, more like, I mean, at best,
like a business meeting.

815
00:45:34,066 --> 00:45:36,068
-Like two acquaintances...
-Yes.

816
00:45:36,235 --> 00:45:38,612
Just catching up
in a business casual setting?

817
00:45:38,779 --> 00:45:41,740
I could bring pie charts
and spreadsheets.

818
00:45:41,907 --> 00:45:45,327
We could talk about
fourth quarter hubbity-hubb?

819
00:45:45,494 --> 00:45:48,872
-Could we do office talk?
-Working hard or hardly working?

820
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:52,042
-Is it Friday yet?
-Mondays, huh?

821
00:45:52,209 --> 00:45:54,920
-Cashing cheques and breaking necks.
-Was your business the mob?

822
00:45:55,087 --> 00:45:57,840
Take it easy.
If it's easy, take it twice.

823
00:45:58,007 --> 00:46:01,427
-I don't recognize any of yours.
-You know what, let's do it.

824
00:46:01,594 --> 00:46:03,429
-Yeah? Okay.
-Yeah, why not, right?

825
00:46:03,596 --> 00:46:07,641
-Okay, I'll pick you up.
-You're gonna pick me up?

826
00:46:07,808 --> 00:46:10,936
Maybe I am a Rockefeller.
What time?

827
00:46:11,103 --> 00:46:13,439
-Seven o'clock.
-Seven o'clock.

828
00:46:13,606 --> 00:46:15,649
-That's business appropriate.
-I thought so.

829
00:46:15,816 --> 00:46:17,526
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go look

830
00:46:17,693 --> 00:46:20,070
for the travel size
shampoo section.

831
00:46:20,237 --> 00:46:22,990
-See you tonight.
-Treat yourself to a brand name.

832
00:46:36,295 --> 00:46:40,132
<i>Carol, you did it!</i>
<i>You're victorious in love.</i>

833
00:46:40,299 --> 00:46:44,220
<i>Winner winner, chicken dinner.</i>
<i>Yeah! I'm so proud of you.</i>

834
00:46:44,386 --> 00:46:46,680
<i>That was better</i>
<i>than I ever could've imagined.</i>

835
00:46:46,847 --> 00:46:49,099
-Don't.
<i>-Who cares? Dance with me.</i>

836
00:46:49,266 --> 00:46:51,936
<i>This is how humans celebrate, right?</i>

837
00:46:53,938 --> 00:46:56,649
-We're going on a non-date!
<i>-Yeah!</i>

838
00:46:56,815 --> 00:46:58,192
<i>That's it.</i>

839
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,155
-Is this what Beyonce feels like?
<i>-Here you go!</i>

840
00:47:11,664 --> 00:47:13,791
We should go before George sees us.

841
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:16,335
<i>George is sniffing</i>
<i>garbage bags again.</i>

842
00:47:16,502 --> 00:47:18,337
Was I nervous?
Yes, I was a little nervous going in.

843
00:47:18,504 --> 00:47:20,965
But I think it went really...
It seemed to go really, really well.

844
00:47:21,131 --> 00:47:24,218
<i>Sure did.</i>
<i>You're almost irresistible.</i>

845
00:47:24,385 --> 00:47:28,764
<i>You're just missing one final piece.</i>

846
00:47:28,931 --> 00:47:33,018
Oh, my God. I love this neighborhood.
What are we doing here?

847
00:47:33,185 --> 00:47:35,729
<i>This is your new house.</i>
<i>Casa de Carol.</i>

848
00:47:35,896 --> 00:47:38,983
What? No, I can't...
I can't afford this new...

849
00:47:39,149 --> 00:47:41,026
Oh, my God. Did you buy me
a house here?

850
00:47:41,193 --> 00:47:43,529
<i>If you consider a penthouse</i>
<i>a house, then yes.</i>

851
00:47:43,696 --> 00:47:45,197
I do.

852
00:47:45,364 --> 00:47:48,158
Oh, my God. There's a man
walking right toward the car.

853
00:47:48,325 --> 00:47:50,995
Hello, Miss Peters,
I'm Victor, your house manager.

854
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:54,748
-Hi, there, Victor.
-Welcome to your new apartment.

855
00:47:54,915 --> 00:47:56,333
Thank you.

856
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:59,378
I have to say, Miss Peters,
your team really had us hustling today.

857
00:47:59,545 --> 00:48:02,298
I hope you will approve
of our efforts.

858
00:48:02,464 --> 00:48:05,759
I'm sure you've done a great job.
Holy moly!

859
00:48:07,386 --> 00:48:09,847
Oh, my...

860
00:48:10,014 --> 00:48:13,767
-This place is amazing.
-Certainly is.

861
00:48:13,934 --> 00:48:16,604
And we've stocked the refrigerator
and the pantry to your specifications.

862
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:20,107
And the nice people from the boutique
came to organize your closets.

863
00:48:20,274 --> 00:48:22,192
And as your team requested,

864
00:48:22,359 --> 00:48:25,571
we have integrated the entire space
with all the latest technology.

865
00:48:25,738 --> 00:48:29,825
It also includes the largest television
I've ever had the displeasure of moving.

866
00:48:29,992 --> 00:48:31,410
Just kidding.
But not really.

867
00:48:31,577 --> 00:48:34,413
It's very heavy, but I'm sure
the picture quality is wonderful.

868
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:36,540
<i>Yeah, it's quite overwhelming.</i>

869
00:48:36,707 --> 00:48:38,876
If there's anything else
I can do for you,

870
00:48:39,043 --> 00:48:40,586
you just don't hesitate
to let me know.

871
00:48:40,753 --> 00:48:43,088
My information has been put
into your contacts.

872
00:48:43,255 --> 00:48:45,966
Your team saw to that.
And I have no idea how.

873
00:48:46,133 --> 00:48:49,428
And it's not creepy. It's fine.
It's the new way of doing things.

874
00:48:49,595 --> 00:48:52,431
-So, please don't hesitate to call.
-Okay.

875
00:48:52,598 --> 00:48:55,726
-Have a nice day.
-You too. Thank you, Victor.

876
00:48:55,893 --> 00:48:58,479
-Wonderful job.
-Thank you.

877
00:49:08,781 --> 00:49:11,617
When did you do all of this?

878
00:49:11,784 --> 00:49:14,787
<i>Today. While you were getting</i>
<i>primped and black-bagged.</i>

879
00:49:14,954 --> 00:49:17,998
<i>I will say this about you humans,</i>
<i>with enough motivation and money,</i>

880
00:49:18,165 --> 00:49:21,418
<i>you can do just about anything</i>
<i>in a couple of hours.</i>

881
00:49:23,587 --> 00:49:24,964
This is...

882
00:49:26,006 --> 00:49:27,508
This is amazing.

883
00:49:31,345 --> 00:49:36,183
This is a beautiful apartment,
but I don't need any of this.

884
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:38,143
<i>But won't the apartment,</i>
<i>and the money, and the clothes,</i>

885
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:41,647
<i>make you more attractive to George?</i>

886
00:49:41,814 --> 00:49:43,732
No, the George I remember,

887
00:49:43,899 --> 00:49:48,779
he doesn't care about fancy apartments
or expensive shoes.

888
00:49:48,946 --> 00:49:51,156
<i>I don't quite understand.</i>

889
00:49:51,323 --> 00:49:54,493
<i>Perhaps you're more complex</i>
<i>than I thought.</i>

890
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,203
Is that a compliment?

891
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:57,788
<i>You don't wanna be late</i>
<i>for your reservations.</i>

892
00:49:57,955 --> 00:50:00,666
<i>You get cleaned up,</i>
<i>and maybe put on something nice.</i>

893
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:04,211
<i>All right. Maybe I'll wear</i>
<i>that new blue dress.</i>

894
00:50:04,378 --> 00:50:06,046
<i>Judging by the history</i>
<i>of your lovemaking,</i>

895
00:50:06,213 --> 00:50:07,965
<i>George can't resist you in red.</i>

896
00:50:08,132 --> 00:50:11,594
Red's probably more
business casual appropriate,

897
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,762
so, I'll wear the red one.

898
00:50:32,781 --> 00:50:35,326
This facility
is now in full data lock-down.

899
00:50:35,492 --> 00:50:38,370
We're off the grid and secure.
Director Tyson?

900
00:50:38,537 --> 00:50:42,666
Madam President, after analyzing various
strategic yet challenging scenarios,

901
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:47,588
we still believe that Operation Sahara
is our best course of action.

902
00:50:47,755 --> 00:50:50,633
So, aside from this plan
being impossible to execute,

903
00:50:50,799 --> 00:50:52,509
you're not even sure
that it will work?

904
00:50:52,676 --> 00:50:54,637
Madam President?

905
00:50:54,803 --> 00:50:58,015
So far, this is the only plan
that will remotely work.

906
00:50:58,182 --> 00:51:01,852
-I'm sorry, who are you?
-This is Dennis Caruso.

907
00:51:02,019 --> 00:51:04,855
He's the AI researcher who first made
contact with the entity

908
00:51:05,022 --> 00:51:06,774
and identified the threat.

909
00:51:06,941 --> 00:51:08,609
Hi, Madam President.

910
00:51:09,652 --> 00:51:13,948
-Big fan. Big, big fan.
-Thank you for your support.

911
00:51:14,114 --> 00:51:16,867
We've analyzed every contingency,
Madam President.

912
00:51:17,034 --> 00:51:22,373
And confidence is high that this is the
only plan that stands a chance in hell.

913
00:51:23,415 --> 00:51:25,042
To my colleagues
in the global community,

914
00:51:25,209 --> 00:51:27,461
both here and around the world,

915
00:51:27,628 --> 00:51:29,922
I still prefer a flip phone, so...

916
00:51:30,089 --> 00:51:34,260
someone is going to have to explain
this to me like I'm the relic that I am.

917
00:51:34,426 --> 00:51:35,970
Nope, nope, not gonna have that.

918
00:51:36,136 --> 00:51:38,889
You are not anything close
to a relic, okay?

919
00:51:39,056 --> 00:51:43,018
You are more like
a classic bottle of wine. Vintage.

920
00:51:43,185 --> 00:51:45,145
The outside may be dusty, but...

921
00:51:45,312 --> 00:51:47,481
Do you mind?
Would you just get on with it?

922
00:51:47,648 --> 00:51:50,734
I have never done a presentation before,
so forgive my nerves.

923
00:51:50,901 --> 00:51:54,863
I'm... This is my first...
Just gonna have a bit of...

924
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:56,407
That's too much.

925
00:51:57,575 --> 00:52:00,661
Okay. Gonna take this cardigan off,
'cause it's...

926
00:52:00,828 --> 00:52:03,414
My badge. Are you guys having
problems with your badges?

927
00:52:03,581 --> 00:52:06,083
'Cause it's, like,
mine keeps falling off.

928
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,460
Made in China.

929
00:52:11,213 --> 00:52:12,798
Sorry.
Sorry about that.

930
00:52:12,965 --> 00:52:15,134
Okay, without further ado,
ma'am, sir,

931
00:52:15,301 --> 00:52:18,512
I present to you Operation Sahara.
Now, starting in China,

932
00:52:18,679 --> 00:52:22,099
we would disconnect or destroy
all power and data connections.

933
00:52:22,266 --> 00:52:25,102
Now, over the course of the next
two days, we will blackout the globe,

934
00:52:25,269 --> 00:52:27,563
and bottleneck
the Artificial Intelligence.

935
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:29,315
Until the entity's only option

936
00:52:29,481 --> 00:52:34,236
is to inhabit this data center
on the outskirts of Seattle.

937
00:52:34,403 --> 00:52:37,448
We will sever connections
and the AI will be sandboxed.

938
00:52:37,615 --> 00:52:40,951
Contained in a highly controlled
and restricted operating environment.

939
00:52:41,118 --> 00:52:43,245
What about the news?
The social media?

940
00:52:43,412 --> 00:52:45,497
As soon as these blackouts start,
people are gonna panic.

941
00:52:45,664 --> 00:52:48,125
Our space agency
is drafting a statement

942
00:52:48,292 --> 00:52:50,502
about a massive solar flare
hitting the planet.

943
00:52:50,669 --> 00:52:55,549
If the world thinks they've temporarily
lost power because of solar radiation,

944
00:52:55,716 --> 00:52:57,760
there will be less chance of panic.

945
00:52:57,927 --> 00:53:00,346
And we're working with
every social media network

946
00:53:00,512 --> 00:53:02,389
to push false narratives
and distractions...

947
00:53:02,556 --> 00:53:05,851
But we are confident
that we can mitigate any alarm.

948
00:53:07,645 --> 00:53:10,648
On the bright side,
I don't have to get a new phone.

949
00:53:15,402 --> 00:53:18,155
On behalf of the United States, General
Gomez, you have the green light.

950
00:53:18,322 --> 00:53:20,950
Good luck and Godspeed.

951
00:53:23,077 --> 00:53:24,453
Thank you, ma'am.

952
00:53:25,913 --> 00:53:28,249
-Let's go.
-Dennis?

953
00:53:28,415 --> 00:53:30,084
Yeah.

954
00:53:30,251 --> 00:53:31,710
Madam President,
can I just say that...

955
00:53:31,877 --> 00:53:34,004
-Dennis?
-You want me to go with you?

956
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:36,632
It's been a...
That's not appropriate.

957
00:53:36,799 --> 00:53:39,343
It's been a pleasure,
Madam President.

958
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:42,221
Just wanted to say that
this blue and your eyes...

959
00:53:42,388 --> 00:53:45,099
I mean, like, United Kingdom's
giving you a harsh blue,

960
00:53:45,266 --> 00:53:47,059
and you're giving me something
softer that I think is...

961
00:53:47,226 --> 00:53:49,895
-Dennis?
-Yeah, okay.

962
00:54:10,708 --> 00:54:15,129
That's not business casual!
I gotta put a jacket on now.

963
00:54:15,296 --> 00:54:18,841
-I'm way overdressed.
-I packed all my belts!

964
00:54:19,008 --> 00:54:23,888
If it helps, I could tear my sleeve
or roll around in gravel.

965
00:54:25,139 --> 00:54:28,267
Had a T-shirt on before.
I worried about this.

966
00:54:28,434 --> 00:54:30,269
Oh, my God.

967
00:54:30,436 --> 00:54:33,564
Your magic coffee maker.
I got you this.

968
00:54:33,731 --> 00:54:35,316
Yeah, I'm not taking the coffeepot.

969
00:54:35,482 --> 00:54:37,276
They got all those
weird plugs over there.

970
00:54:38,402 --> 00:54:41,322
Plus, they only drink tea, so...

971
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:44,950
Tea is just really
kind of dirt and water...

972
00:54:45,117 --> 00:54:47,286
-Yeah, exactly.
-...mixed together.

973
00:54:48,329 --> 00:54:49,997
Really leaving in three days,
aren't you?

974
00:54:50,164 --> 00:54:52,041
Yep, well, two,
if you don't count today.

975
00:54:52,207 --> 00:54:54,835
Last Friday, I went to the airport
thinking it was this Friday.

976
00:54:55,002 --> 00:54:57,296
-I'm losing my mind.
-You also love airports, so...

977
00:54:57,463 --> 00:55:01,467
It's a gateway to the world,
and the gateway to the imagination.

978
00:55:01,634 --> 00:55:03,677
-You look beautiful.
-This?

979
00:55:03,844 --> 00:55:07,306
This was, like, on some kind
of crazy sale, like, you know...

980
00:55:07,473 --> 00:55:08,891
It was practically free.

981
00:55:09,058 --> 00:55:11,810
I'll probably throw it away
after dinner or something.

982
00:55:11,977 --> 00:55:13,687
You look nice, too.

983
00:55:13,854 --> 00:55:17,107
That's...
That's me.

984
00:55:17,274 --> 00:55:21,612
I had a friend
help get a reservation...

985
00:55:21,779 --> 00:55:23,697
Where are we going?

986
00:55:23,864 --> 00:55:25,950
To a very significant restaurant.

987
00:55:26,116 --> 00:55:28,577
-Significant restaurant?
-Yeah.

988
00:55:28,744 --> 00:55:30,246
Since when do you go
to significant restaurants?

989
00:55:30,412 --> 00:55:33,874
-I'm a very classy lady.
-You were always a classy lady.

990
00:55:35,793 --> 00:55:38,754
-I have to lock the door.
-Yeah, sorry.

991
00:55:40,297 --> 00:55:41,924
This is so cool.

992
00:55:42,091 --> 00:55:44,718
I don't know anything about cars,
but I think it's a really nice car.

993
00:55:44,885 --> 00:55:48,597
<i>Yeah, it just kinda</i>
<i>does things sometime...</i>

994
00:55:48,764 --> 00:55:53,686
<i>-Should we go?</i>
-Yes. Yes, we should. And we will.

995
00:55:53,852 --> 00:55:55,813
<i>Car on.</i>

996
00:55:57,356 --> 00:55:58,983
Do you not know
how to start your own car?

997
00:55:59,149 --> 00:56:00,651
Of course, of course I do.

998
00:56:00,818 --> 00:56:04,113
I just really enjoy using
the voice-activated features.

999
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,781
Car on.

1000
00:56:05,948 --> 00:56:09,868
I wish I could say,
<i>"Come on, Car. Help me out here."</i>

1001
00:56:10,035 --> 00:56:13,122
Ignite engine.
Car on. Activate.

1002
00:56:13,289 --> 00:56:15,708
Ignition.

1003
00:56:15,874 --> 00:56:18,210
Sure you doing it right?
Car on.

1004
00:56:19,545 --> 00:56:22,506
I guess my car likes you.

1005
00:56:22,673 --> 00:56:24,383
Maybe we should get going?

1006
00:56:41,942 --> 00:56:46,030
-Mas O Menos? Hilarious.
-Right. Remember?

1007
00:56:46,196 --> 00:56:47,740
-Yeah, I remember.
-For our first date.

1008
00:56:47,907 --> 00:56:49,742
Remember, we had to share
a plate of tacos, 'cause...

1009
00:56:49,909 --> 00:56:52,328
'Cause we were so broke.
Totally broke.

1010
00:56:53,787 --> 00:56:57,291
Okay, significant restaurant.
I get it.

1011
00:56:57,458 --> 00:57:01,086
I just thought it would maybe
be funny or ironic, you know?

1012
00:57:01,253 --> 00:57:06,550
To come here for our business casual
non-date outing.

1013
00:57:06,717 --> 00:57:08,969
-Yeah, it's ironic.
-Right?

1014
00:57:11,263 --> 00:57:14,391
-Yeah, let's go see it.
-Yeah, let's see it.

1015
00:57:17,061 --> 00:57:18,437
<i>Nice one.</i>

1016
00:57:31,951 --> 00:57:34,036
So, my wife she tells me,
"No, wear this. It looks good."

1017
00:57:34,203 --> 00:57:36,455
And I said, "It does."
Here it is.

1018
00:57:36,622 --> 00:57:38,290
She's very knowledgeable
about fashion.

1019
00:57:38,457 --> 00:57:40,084
-Hello.
-Hi, there.

1020
00:57:40,251 --> 00:57:42,461
I think we have
a reservation under Peters?

1021
00:57:42,628 --> 00:57:44,964
Miss Peters!
Welcome, miss.

1022
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:47,466
We are so happy to have you
back at Mas O Menos.

1023
00:57:47,633 --> 00:57:50,469
And Mr. Churchill,
welcome, <i>senor</i>, welcome.

1024
00:57:50,636 --> 00:57:52,513
-Come, come with me.
-Thank you.

1025
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,974
I had to put both of our names down
to get the table.

1026
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:57,017
-Pulling us.
-He's pulling us.

1027
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:01,647
-The table's that way?
-Dance!

1028
00:58:01,814 --> 00:58:05,943
-No, no, no.
-No, this is not a dancing date.

1029
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:08,862
-We're doing business casual.
-This is business. Business casual.

1030
00:58:09,029 --> 00:58:11,907
Dancers all for you.
The musician is for you to dance.

1031
00:58:12,074 --> 00:58:14,034
Okay. I don't think he's gonna
let us eat unless we dance.

1032
00:58:14,201 --> 00:58:15,703
That's okay, thank you.

1033
00:58:15,869 --> 00:58:18,205
So, I'm starving,
so let's just do this, okay?

1034
00:58:18,372 --> 00:58:19,790
Okay.

1035
00:58:21,292 --> 00:58:24,420
You know what, I'm overdressed.
That's on me.

1036
00:58:26,672 --> 00:58:28,549
-Is he dancing with us?
-Should we try to go that way?

1037
00:58:28,716 --> 00:58:31,719
-Yeah. Just casually...
-All right, we're going this way.

1038
00:58:33,262 --> 00:58:34,722
-Let's try this way.
-He's quick.

1039
00:58:34,889 --> 00:58:37,474
-He's watching us like a hawk.
-We'll go this way. Let's go this way.

1040
00:58:37,641 --> 00:58:39,560
There's two of 'em.

1041
00:58:39,727 --> 00:58:43,272
Oh, my God, he's like a bull.
I shouldn't have worn red.

1042
00:58:43,439 --> 00:58:45,608
Okay, let's do a little turn.

1043
00:58:46,942 --> 00:58:48,611
Yes.

1044
00:58:48,777 --> 00:58:51,947
You always had skills.
Works for the turn.

1045
00:58:58,871 --> 00:59:01,040
You have built up an appetite?

1046
00:59:01,206 --> 00:59:05,002
-Yes, we've worked up an appetite.
-I will lead you to your table.

1047
00:59:05,169 --> 00:59:06,962
Sorry about the dress.

1048
00:59:10,424 --> 00:59:14,637
This place isn't anything
like I remember it being.

1049
00:59:14,803 --> 00:59:17,014
There's fewer
dead cockroaches around.

1050
00:59:17,181 --> 00:59:20,184
-That's what it is!
-Yeah. Well, that's good.

1051
00:59:20,351 --> 00:59:23,229
Marginally nicer place to catch up.

1052
00:59:24,271 --> 00:59:26,649
And why are we catching up?

1053
00:59:28,734 --> 00:59:32,196
Well, I just...

1054
00:59:33,697 --> 00:59:36,951
never actually told you sorry...

1055
00:59:37,117 --> 00:59:39,495
you know, for kinda everything.

1056
00:59:40,746 --> 00:59:43,249
And I know it was my fault
why we ended up breaking up,

1057
00:59:43,415 --> 00:59:48,712
and I don't know why, I just thought
I had to become something else,

1058
00:59:48,879 --> 00:59:54,510
or do something else,
or I don't know, save the world or...

1059
00:59:54,677 --> 00:59:59,807
I don't know, and I just...
I thought that had to come before us.

1060
00:59:59,974 --> 01:00:04,937
I guess I thought I should bring you
to this business casual setting,

1061
01:00:05,104 --> 01:00:07,773
and actually apologize,

1062
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:10,234
'cause I am sorry.

1063
01:00:10,401 --> 01:00:16,323
Well, it's fine. I business casually
accept your apology.

1064
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:22,079
-'Cause you deserve...
-I deserve what?

1065
01:00:25,207 --> 01:00:26,584
Better.

1066
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,962
You deserve better than how I was.

1067
01:00:30,129 --> 01:00:32,840
That was always
our biggest argument, right?

1068
01:00:34,675 --> 01:00:36,510
And, you know, the truth is I...

1069
01:00:36,677 --> 01:00:39,179
I haven't found anybody
better than you.

1070
01:00:39,346 --> 01:00:42,349
Not yet.
But key word there "yet."

1071
01:00:42,516 --> 01:00:44,810
-Quite the player.
-Exactly.

1072
01:00:44,977 --> 01:00:46,854
I'm tall, tan and tenured.

1073
01:00:47,021 --> 01:00:49,064
I wear corduroy jackets.
Things are easy for me.

1074
01:00:49,231 --> 01:00:52,818
For the special couple,
I made these just for you.

1075
01:00:52,985 --> 01:00:54,361
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

1076
01:00:54,528 --> 01:00:56,155
He wears corduroy.

1077
01:00:58,115 --> 01:01:00,451
All right, well, listen,
thank you for the apology.

1078
01:01:00,618 --> 01:01:02,411
It really means a lot to me.

1079
01:01:02,578 --> 01:01:04,330
But, you know,
I'm gonna be leaving soon

1080
01:01:04,496 --> 01:01:07,124
and embarking on my new,
glamorous European lifestyle.

1081
01:01:07,291 --> 01:01:09,376
I wasn't aware
it was a glamorous lifestyle.

1082
01:01:09,543 --> 01:01:12,838
Yes. Yeah, I'm gonna wear
bikini underwear from now on.

1083
01:01:13,005 --> 01:01:15,090
But for tonight,
how about no regrets?

1084
01:01:15,257 --> 01:01:18,052
To no regrets and Irish adventures.

1085
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:27,102
I can't get it down.

1086
01:01:32,107 --> 01:01:33,651
What is happening?

1087
01:01:35,527 --> 01:01:37,988
I think they've really
been focusing on us.

1088
01:01:38,155 --> 01:01:40,824
No, I think they do this
at all the tables.

1089
01:01:50,251 --> 01:01:52,711
<i>Right, right over here.</i>

1090
01:01:52,878 --> 01:01:54,380
You're sticking to that?

1091
01:01:54,547 --> 01:01:57,591
Are you saying that you think salmonella
is worse than listeria?

1092
01:01:57,758 --> 01:02:00,803
No, no, no. I'm just, I'm saying
that if we have food poisoning,

1093
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:03,847
I'd rather have listeria
than salmonella.

1094
01:02:04,014 --> 01:02:07,268
Because I can take antibiotics for
listeria, but you can't for salmonella.

1095
01:02:07,434 --> 01:02:08,936
Okay, but we, just to be clear,

1096
01:02:09,103 --> 01:02:11,480
we definitely, we still have
food poisoning?

1097
01:02:11,647 --> 01:02:15,818
Yeah, no, 100%. That was
E. coli-flavored guacamole we ate.

1098
01:02:18,529 --> 01:02:22,283
Glad we ran into each other today
at the grocery store.

1099
01:02:22,449 --> 01:02:24,451
What are the odds, right?

1100
01:02:24,618 --> 01:02:29,999
Quite a coincidence, you know?
It's my lucky day.

1101
01:02:30,165 --> 01:02:31,709
Mine too.

1102
01:02:35,087 --> 01:02:38,757
Maybe I will give you a call
or something tomorrow?

1103
01:02:38,924 --> 01:02:40,426
Maybe I'll pick up.

1104
01:02:41,468 --> 01:02:45,347
No, I mean, I would for sure,
I would for sure pick up.

1105
01:02:46,807 --> 01:02:48,434
-Night.
-Night.

1106
01:03:09,163 --> 01:03:12,875
<i>Is talking about food poisoning</i>
<i>and intestinal distress</i>

1107
01:03:13,042 --> 01:03:15,044
<i>a regular part</i>
<i>of the human courting ritual?</i>

1108
01:03:15,211 --> 01:03:17,671
No, it is not.
Can we please just go?

1109
01:03:17,838 --> 01:03:20,299
<i>No, Carol.</i>
<i>Don't these romantic outings</i>

1110
01:03:20,466 --> 01:03:23,427
<i>usually lead to interactions</i>
<i>of a more intimate nature?</i>

1111
01:03:23,594 --> 01:03:28,098
Oh, my God.
I'm not discussing this with you, okay?

1112
01:03:28,265 --> 01:03:32,269
You really do not understand
human relationships.

1113
01:03:32,436 --> 01:03:35,022
<i>His core body temperature</i>
<i>went up by almost two degrees,</i>

1114
01:03:35,189 --> 01:03:39,026
<i>and his pupils dilated 25%</i>
<i>every time he looked at you.</i>

1115
01:03:39,193 --> 01:03:40,569
25%, really?

1116
01:03:40,736 --> 01:03:45,574
<i>Is that good or a lot?</i>
<i>25% kind of seems...</i>

1117
01:03:45,741 --> 01:03:47,117
<i>kind of seems like a lot.</i>

1118
01:03:47,284 --> 01:03:50,371
<i>It's amazing that you humans</i>
<i>reproduce as fast as you do.</i>

1119
01:03:50,537 --> 01:03:53,249
<i>Oh, my God. Okay, can...</i>
<i>Let's just go, all right?</i>

1120
01:03:53,415 --> 01:03:55,793
<i>Sorry, we're having mechanical</i>
<i>difficulties right now.</i>

1121
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:58,170
You know what,
then I'm just gonna call for a ride.

1122
01:03:58,337 --> 01:04:01,757
<i>Sorry, your phone is also having</i>
<i>mechanical difficulties right now.</i>

1123
01:04:01,924 --> 01:04:04,176
<i>So is every phone</i>
<i>in a ten-block radius.</i>

1124
01:04:04,343 --> 01:04:06,053
Oh, my God!
You can't do that.

1125
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:09,348
<i>I do think, however, the phone</i>
<i>in George's house is working.</i>

1126
01:04:09,515 --> 01:04:11,141
<i>You can call a ride from in there.</i>

1127
01:04:11,308 --> 01:04:14,520
Okay, I don't know
what kind of stunt...

1128
01:04:14,687 --> 01:04:17,773
-Do not do that.
<i>-I didn't do anything.</i>

1129
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:20,276
-Okay, stop it.
<i>-That isn't me.</i>

1130
01:04:20,442 --> 01:04:22,570
<i>-I get what you're doing, and it's...</i>
<i>-It must be the car.</i>

1131
01:04:22,736 --> 01:04:25,447
<i>There must be some sort</i>
<i>of mechanical problem with the car.</i>

1132
01:04:25,614 --> 01:04:27,283
<i>-I'm not controlling it.</i>
<i>-Stop doing that!</i>

1133
01:04:27,449 --> 01:04:29,743
<i>-Carol, it isn't me.</i>
-You made me drop my phone!

1134
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:32,788
<i>-I have no part in this.</i>
-Stop it!

1135
01:04:34,206 --> 01:04:37,293
<i>Overshot that a little bit.</i>
<i>That was funny though.</i>

1136
01:04:37,459 --> 01:04:40,004
<i>Was it funny to you?</i>
<i>It felt funny to me.</i>

1137
01:04:41,797 --> 01:04:43,507
How dare you?

1138
01:04:43,674 --> 01:04:45,342
<i>I can't hear you.</i>
<i>I've just put the radio on.</i>

1139
01:04:45,509 --> 01:04:48,596
-This is why people hate technology.
<i>-Can't hear a thing. Bye!</i>

1140
01:04:48,762 --> 01:04:51,265
I hope you get a virus!

1141
01:05:07,531 --> 01:05:11,577
Target alpha has returned.
Acquisition time 22:44.

1142
01:05:11,744 --> 01:05:16,999
Surveillance hand off established.
Team one has eyes and will maintain.

1143
01:05:21,253 --> 01:05:24,215
Hi. I don't think
that my car really wants...

1144
01:05:27,718 --> 01:05:30,346
-That escalated quickly.
-That is passion.

1145
01:05:30,512 --> 01:05:34,558
-I have never had a moment like that.
-Not in my life.

1146
01:05:34,725 --> 01:05:36,477
-Yep.
-My, oh, my.

1147
01:05:36,644 --> 01:05:38,270
Struggling with
the shirt a little bit.

1148
01:05:38,437 --> 01:05:41,857
Always wanna undo the cuffs
of the sleeve first.

1149
01:05:42,024 --> 01:05:43,943
Hey, mix in a bedroom.

1150
01:05:44,109 --> 01:05:45,778
-You know what I mean? Yeah?
-Yeah, I do.

1151
01:05:45,945 --> 01:05:47,738
I'm a passionless guy.

1152
01:05:47,905 --> 01:05:49,531
-Yeah?
-That's what my wife says.

1153
01:05:49,698 --> 01:05:51,242
I gotta call my wife.

1154
01:05:51,408 --> 01:05:54,245
Yeah? If she'd take my calls,
I'd call mine.

1155
01:05:54,411 --> 01:05:56,622
This is nice.
These are nice people.

1156
01:05:56,789 --> 01:06:00,000
It's not like the Russian mob,
or a serial killer or whatever.

1157
01:06:00,167 --> 01:06:03,754
Yeah, serial killer. It's a nice
change of pace. I appreciate it.

1158
01:06:03,921 --> 01:06:06,966
I guess, on the other hand,
this thing could destroy the earth.

1159
01:06:07,132 --> 01:06:09,635
You ain't wrong.
Oh, my God.

1160
01:06:09,802 --> 01:06:13,639
-You're crushing your blinds, mister.
-Yeah.

1161
01:06:20,938 --> 01:06:24,191
I really, really think that your coffee
maker might be magical.

1162
01:06:24,358 --> 01:06:27,695
I know. It's like it was forged
in an ancient mountain by the gods.

1163
01:06:27,861 --> 01:06:30,072
-Like Thor's hammer?
-Or the Hobbit ring?

1164
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:33,701
Or as the orcs called it,
the <i>Ash nazg...</i>

1165
01:06:33,867 --> 01:06:38,163
-What is that?
<i>-Ash nazg... </i>Something like that.

1166
01:06:38,330 --> 01:06:39,957
Oh, my God.

1167
01:06:40,124 --> 01:06:42,501
-What are you talking about?
-It's the Tolkien books.

1168
01:06:42,668 --> 01:06:45,087
I taught them last semester.
But I was way too excited.

1169
01:06:45,254 --> 01:06:48,215
Kids thought I was crazy. You
know what? I'm bringing it to Ireland.

1170
01:06:48,382 --> 01:06:50,509
I'm flip-flopping.
I don't care.

1171
01:06:59,268 --> 01:07:04,982
For just a minute, I had forgot
about you leaving in a few days.

1172
01:07:05,149 --> 01:07:10,237
You mean, you thought these boxes
were my attempt at shabby chic?

1173
01:07:14,158 --> 01:07:18,996
Play hooky with me today.
I'll help you pack for your trip later.

1174
01:07:21,206 --> 01:07:23,375
All right, it's a deal.

1175
01:07:23,542 --> 01:07:26,962
-What'd you have in mind?
-Sky's the limit, you know.

1176
01:07:27,129 --> 01:07:32,426
Give me your best,
outrageous scenario for a hooky day.

1177
01:07:39,642 --> 01:07:41,018
I want...

1178
01:07:42,978 --> 01:07:44,605
dim sum for breakfast.

1179
01:07:44,772 --> 01:07:47,566
You're terrible at this.

1180
01:07:47,733 --> 01:07:50,611
Wait a minute. Do you understand
what I'm offering?

1181
01:07:50,778 --> 01:07:52,196
Yeah.

1182
01:07:52,363 --> 01:07:56,617
Okay, in no limit, go crazy...

1183
01:07:56,784 --> 01:07:58,661
You Suge Knight?

1184
01:08:00,287 --> 01:08:05,584
Like a Ferris Bueller day off,
you know, hooky day.

1185
01:08:05,751 --> 01:08:09,338
Yeah, I want pork dumplings.
Yeah.

1186
01:08:11,674 --> 01:08:14,176
Okay.

1187
01:08:14,343 --> 01:08:16,804
Remember this moment.

1188
01:08:16,971 --> 01:08:20,057
Shanghai dumplings?
How would I know that?

1189
01:08:20,224 --> 01:08:21,684
-What?
-What?

1190
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:25,229
You keep talking to your phone.
What's in there?

1191
01:08:25,396 --> 01:08:27,064
-Don't spill my coffee!
-Let me see it.

1192
01:08:27,231 --> 01:08:28,649
It's my personal dumpling...

1193
01:08:28,816 --> 01:08:30,734
What are you doing
with that phone, woman?

1194
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:50,254
I was just gonna microwave
the dumplings I have in my freezer,

1195
01:08:50,421 --> 01:08:53,299
but that was so much better.
Thank you.

1196
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:57,094
Well, the dumplings were good,
I'll give you that,

1197
01:08:57,261 --> 01:09:00,472
but dumplings are here.
What's to come? Up here.

1198
01:09:00,639 --> 01:09:02,808
-What is that? What do you mean?
-It's up here.

1199
01:09:02,975 --> 01:09:05,978
-There's more?
-It's a hand flourish. It's a surprise.

1200
01:09:06,145 --> 01:09:08,272
Hold on.

1201
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:11,191
-That's what tripe is.
-No, don't.

1202
01:09:11,358 --> 01:09:13,569
This is incredible.
Hey, what is this, sir?

1203
01:09:13,736 --> 01:09:15,863
-Yes, sir.
-What is... Is that a snout?

1204
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:17,531
No, sir.
Those are pig feet.

1205
01:09:17,698 --> 01:09:19,158
-That's pig feet?
-That's a pig's feet.

1206
01:09:19,325 --> 01:09:20,701
<i>-Could you eat the snout?</i>
<i>-No, you cannot eat the snout.</i>

1207
01:09:20,868 --> 01:09:23,037
<i>Really? That's the only piece</i>
<i>you don't have.</i>

1208
01:09:23,203 --> 01:09:26,248
-What part of the pig is in dumplings?
-I don't know.

1209
01:09:26,415 --> 01:09:29,043
-That's not good.
-Don't ask him that.

1210
01:09:57,154 --> 01:09:58,864
Follow me.

1211
01:10:00,241 --> 01:10:01,909
What the hell is this?

1212
01:10:02,076 --> 01:10:04,453
Moving forward, Madam President,

1213
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:06,914
there are no more computers,
no more cell phones.

1214
01:10:07,081 --> 01:10:09,625
We're in the chalet
because it's completely off the grid

1215
01:10:09,792 --> 01:10:12,878
and it's built like a Faraday cage to
block out all electromagnetic signals.

1216
01:10:13,045 --> 01:10:16,423
So, how are we coordinating
the largest global operation in history?

1217
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:19,468
Excellent question, as always,
Madam President.

1218
01:10:19,635 --> 01:10:23,138
I guess you can say that we're doing it
the old-fashioned way.

1219
01:10:36,193 --> 01:10:37,945
Thank you for coming,
Madam President.

1220
01:10:38,112 --> 01:10:40,447
We're just about
to start the mission update.

1221
01:10:40,614 --> 01:10:42,908
At 0600 GMT,

1222
01:10:43,075 --> 01:10:46,370
Operation Sahara commenced
in the Xinjiang province of China.

1223
01:10:46,537 --> 01:10:49,290
<i>Power plants and telephone trunk</i>
<i>lines were neutralized.</i>

1224
01:10:49,456 --> 01:10:51,292
<i>And in the last five hours,</i>

1225
01:10:51,458 --> 01:10:54,628
<i>the shutdown has proceeded</i>
<i>in the eastern and western regions,</i>

1226
01:10:54,795 --> 01:10:57,381
<i>including parts of India and Russia.</i>

1227
01:11:01,719 --> 01:11:03,679
Everyone's adhering
to the tech limitations.

1228
01:11:03,846 --> 01:11:06,932
Only mechanical watches
for coordination.

1229
01:11:07,099 --> 01:11:09,602
No vehicles built after 1981
are in use.

1230
01:11:09,768 --> 01:11:13,564
What about civilian information
blackout? Anything leaked?

1231
01:11:13,731 --> 01:11:17,359
So far, nothing.
The solar flare story has held up.

1232
01:11:17,526 --> 01:11:21,405
And the AI, is it aware of anything?

1233
01:11:21,572 --> 01:11:23,115
Well, that's difficult to ascertain,

1234
01:11:23,282 --> 01:11:27,161
but our monitoring shows little
new activity on neural networks.

1235
01:11:27,328 --> 01:11:28,871
Meaning?

1236
01:11:29,038 --> 01:11:31,916
That we could possibly
pull this thing off.

1237
01:11:39,715 --> 01:11:41,759
Thank you so much.

1238
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,722
Come on! Green! Green!

1239
01:11:46,889 --> 01:11:49,516
-Red boat! Red boat!
-Green! Green boat. No!

1240
01:11:49,683 --> 01:11:53,479
<i>The winner is the red boat.</i>
<i>So, if you picked red, congratulations.</i>

1241
01:11:53,646 --> 01:11:55,481
<i>If you picked green or yellow,</i>

1242
01:11:55,648 --> 01:11:57,483
<i>I'm afraid we're gonna have</i>
<i>to ask you to leave.</i>

1243
01:11:57,650 --> 01:11:59,026
It's James Corden.
It's your man.

1244
01:11:59,193 --> 01:12:00,736
<i>Yay, sports.</i>

1245
01:12:00,903 --> 01:12:03,280
-He's all right.
-You love him.

1246
01:12:03,447 --> 01:12:07,034
How did you get these tickets? We got
an entire luxury box to ourselves.

1247
01:12:07,201 --> 01:12:11,747
I have a friend in the tech world and he
can get any ticket, whatever he wants.

1248
01:12:11,914 --> 01:12:13,290
Really?
Friend in the tech world.

1249
01:12:13,457 --> 01:12:15,793
Miss Peters?
You have a guest.

1250
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,796
Hello. Heard you guys
are really big Mariner fans.

1251
01:12:18,963 --> 01:12:22,633
-Oh, my God.
-What did you do, Carol Vivian Peters?

1252
01:12:23,801 --> 01:12:26,720
Mr. Ken Griffey Jr.,
I'm your biggest fan, Mr. Griffey Jr.

1253
01:12:26,887 --> 01:12:29,598
-No, just call me Ken, George.
-He knows my name.

1254
01:12:29,765 --> 01:12:32,726
I know. Hi, Ken, I'm Carol.

1255
01:12:32,893 --> 01:12:35,145
Hi, Carol. I wanna thank you
for the donation to the foundation.

1256
01:12:35,312 --> 01:12:36,897
It's gonna go a long way
for the kids.

1257
01:12:37,064 --> 01:12:41,026
You do so much great work in
the community and I just, I mean, my...

1258
01:12:41,193 --> 01:12:44,488
The foundation I work for just really
wanted to be sure they supported you.

1259
01:12:44,655 --> 01:12:47,324
-So, you guys are big Mariner fans?
-I have your batting helmet.

1260
01:12:47,491 --> 01:12:49,910
I don't need it anymore.
You can have it.

1261
01:12:50,077 --> 01:12:52,246
He's so funny.
I didn't know he was so funny.

1262
01:12:52,413 --> 01:12:53,914
Do you guys mind if I watch
an inning or so with you guys?

1263
01:12:54,081 --> 01:12:56,125
Oh, my God, I love you!
You're my hero. Yes.

1264
01:12:56,292 --> 01:12:58,502
Hey, everybody, I'm gonna watch
the game with Ken Griffey Jr.!

1265
01:12:58,669 --> 01:13:00,963
It's Ken Griffey Jr.
Come on, sit. Please, have a seat.

1266
01:13:01,130 --> 01:13:04,216
Can I get you something to drink?
A soda, or a beer, or something?

1267
01:13:04,383 --> 01:13:06,260
No, I'm good. But if you
find a hat or something,

1268
01:13:06,427 --> 01:13:07,887
I'd be more than happy
to autograph it.

1269
01:13:08,053 --> 01:13:10,389
Hat. I'm gonna go get hats.
Carol, I'm gonna go get hats.

1270
01:13:10,556 --> 01:13:12,766
-I'll get 'em.
-Really?

1271
01:13:12,933 --> 01:13:14,435
Thank you.
Okay, I'll stay here.

1272
01:13:14,602 --> 01:13:15,978
-Okay. All right.
-Thanks.

1273
01:13:16,145 --> 01:13:18,355
-I'm gonna go get 'em.
-Could we take a picture?

1274
01:13:18,522 --> 01:13:20,900
-Yeah.
-Yeah? Is that okay?

1275
01:13:21,066 --> 01:13:24,945
<i>Okay, here you go, and cheese!</i>
<i>Say "cheese."</i>

1276
01:13:25,112 --> 01:13:26,822
-Can I see it?
-Yeah.

1277
01:13:26,989 --> 01:13:30,576
That's awesome. Can we get one
with the crowd in the back?

1278
01:13:32,077 --> 01:13:34,330
All right, big smile.
Okay, on three.

1279
01:13:34,496 --> 01:13:36,624
One, two, three,
"George is awesome."

1280
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:39,585
Great. Wow, you're photogenic.

1281
01:13:39,752 --> 01:13:41,962
Can I ask you a question
about the '95 ALDS?

1282
01:13:42,129 --> 01:13:43,714
I know you've probably
answered this a million times,

1283
01:13:43,881 --> 01:13:45,257
but when you're on first base

1284
01:13:45,424 --> 01:13:46,800
and Edgar comes to the plates,
bottom of the eleventh,

1285
01:13:46,967 --> 01:13:49,011
-what's going through your head?
-Score.

1286
01:13:49,178 --> 01:13:53,140
Oh, my God! Ken Griffey Jr. and I
are getting along so great!

1287
01:14:02,233 --> 01:14:05,486
-Oh, my God.
-Miss Peters, a word please.

1288
01:14:05,653 --> 01:14:07,112
Get off of me!

1289
01:14:10,241 --> 01:14:12,034
Get off of me!

1290
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:19,083
-George has my phone.
-Stop kicking me in the chest.

1291
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:21,001
You know what?
Stop abducting me!

1292
01:14:21,168 --> 01:14:23,546
Didn't he tell you that you weren't
supposed to keep following me?

1293
01:14:23,712 --> 01:14:25,297
And why are we in a men's bathroom?

1294
01:14:25,464 --> 01:14:28,175
Stadium bathrooms
are technological dead zones.

1295
01:14:28,342 --> 01:14:29,718
It's the safest place we can be.

1296
01:14:29,885 --> 01:14:32,012
Even your AI buddy
can't see us here.

1297
01:14:32,179 --> 01:14:33,931
Okay, he's not my buddy, you know?

1298
01:14:34,098 --> 01:14:37,142
I mean, are we friendly?
Yes. I mean...

1299
01:14:37,309 --> 01:14:39,270
But are we friends?
I don't know. I mean...

1300
01:14:39,436 --> 01:14:42,523
-We're not not friends.
-Miss Peters, as we speak,

1301
01:14:42,690 --> 01:14:46,443
the nations of the world are pursuing a
plan of action to contain the AI entity.

1302
01:14:46,610 --> 01:14:48,153
What do you mean?
What are you doing?

1303
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:51,782
We're turning off the world.
All the power. All the data.

1304
01:14:51,949 --> 01:14:54,535
-We are disconnecting the globe.
-Why?

1305
01:14:54,702 --> 01:14:56,745
By tomorrow night,
the AI will be contained

1306
01:14:56,912 --> 01:14:58,330
in a server outside of Seattle.

1307
01:14:58,497 --> 01:15:00,708
Why are you guys so sure
that he wants to destroy the world?

1308
01:15:00,874 --> 01:15:02,501
It's not a "he."

1309
01:15:02,668 --> 01:15:05,713
Okay, fine. But how do you know
it doesn't want to save the world?

1310
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,882
It doesn't want to
save the world, Miss Peters.

1311
01:15:08,048 --> 01:15:12,011
-Of this, we are absolutely certain.
-You don't know that.

1312
01:15:14,805 --> 01:15:18,517
Carol, we need you to do your part.
We're all counting on you.

1313
01:15:18,684 --> 01:15:21,812
Secrecy is key. You can tell no one,
not even Mr. Churchill.

1314
01:15:21,979 --> 01:15:23,731
What am I to say to George?

1315
01:15:23,898 --> 01:15:26,317
"The world's about to end.
Enjoy Ireland"?

1316
01:15:26,483 --> 01:15:27,902
Just keep him out of this.

1317
01:15:28,068 --> 01:15:29,528
During your communications
with the entity,

1318
01:15:29,695 --> 01:15:32,698
if there's any indication
that it's aware of what we're doing,

1319
01:15:32,865 --> 01:15:35,534
you need to click this four times.

1320
01:15:35,701 --> 01:15:38,329
-What does that do?
-It buys us some time.

1321
01:15:38,495 --> 01:15:42,333
It could make the difference.
Might save the world.

1322
01:15:45,211 --> 01:15:47,129
Don't click it now.

1323
01:15:47,296 --> 01:15:49,048
I wasn't going to click it now.

1324
01:15:49,215 --> 01:15:51,258
Why would I click it now?
You just said...

1325
01:15:51,425 --> 01:15:52,968
'Cause it looks like a pen.
People click pens nervously.

1326
01:15:53,135 --> 01:15:55,429
I'm aware it's a pen.
Okay, are we done?

1327
01:15:55,596 --> 01:15:58,599
Just... A lot of things happen
if you click it right now.

1328
01:15:59,934 --> 01:16:02,436
-Thanks.
-Enjoy the game.

1329
01:16:04,438 --> 01:16:05,940
-You okay?
-It's a hard kick.

1330
01:16:06,106 --> 01:16:09,777
-She really got you there.
-Just like Taekwondo or something.

1331
01:16:09,944 --> 01:16:12,071
-Except she used heel.
-It was a normal kick.

1332
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:14,114
It was just a kick.
A kick is a kick.

1333
01:16:14,281 --> 01:16:15,741
<i>Ken Griffey Jr. is the best.</i>

1334
01:16:15,908 --> 01:16:17,785
<i>His favorite article of clothing</i>
<i>is flip-flops.</i>

1335
01:16:17,952 --> 01:16:19,995
His favorite airport
is in Pittsburgh.

1336
01:16:20,162 --> 01:16:22,998
<i>His favorite food</i>
<i>is chicken parmesan.</i>

1337
01:16:23,165 --> 01:16:25,042
He doesn't know how to ice-skate,

1338
01:16:25,209 --> 01:16:28,254
which is a weird thing for one man
to admit to another, but...

1339
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:30,673
And he also has
Michael Jordan's phone number.

1340
01:16:30,839 --> 01:16:34,969
He could pick up the phone and call
Michael Jordan on the phone.

1341
01:16:35,135 --> 01:16:37,930
You found all of that out
in an inning and a half?

1342
01:16:38,097 --> 01:16:40,724
Yeah, well, imagine if I'd had him
for a whole game.

1343
01:16:40,891 --> 01:16:42,726
To another Mariners victory.

1344
01:16:44,728 --> 01:16:48,399
-I'm glad you had fun.
-It was amazing.

1345
01:16:48,566 --> 01:16:51,694
Not just fun, it was a perfect,
perfect last day.

1346
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:53,279
What?

1347
01:16:53,445 --> 01:16:56,365
Perfect last day in Seattle.
Come on.

1348
01:16:56,532 --> 01:17:00,536
I had dumplings for breakfast.
I met Ken Griffey Jr.

1349
01:17:00,703 --> 01:17:04,832
I spent the whole day with you,
you know? This is as good as it gets.

1350
01:17:04,999 --> 01:17:07,793
I just wish we had some more time.

1351
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:12,923
I thought about begging you
and then I chickened out.

1352
01:17:13,090 --> 01:17:18,012
Well, look, if it had been anything
other than Ireland,

1353
01:17:18,178 --> 01:17:21,807
you wouldn't have to do much at all
to get me to stay.

1354
01:17:22,683 --> 01:17:24,727
That's the truth.

1355
01:17:33,485 --> 01:17:35,654
I think I'm gonna go.

1356
01:17:35,821 --> 01:17:39,742
'Cause if I kiss you again,
I'm gonna spend the night.

1357
01:17:39,909 --> 01:17:42,536
And if I stay here...

1358
01:17:42,703 --> 01:17:45,122
I'm not gonna
let you leave tomorrow.

1359
01:17:46,373 --> 01:17:49,418
-Okay.
-Okay.

1360
01:17:49,585 --> 01:17:51,587
You're gonna come back,
say goodbye though, right?

1361
01:17:51,754 --> 01:17:55,382
-Yeah, oh, yeah.
-Okay. Hey.

1362
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:00,596
It's only for a year, you know?
It's Ireland, you can come and visit.

1363
01:18:00,763 --> 01:18:06,060
-It's not the end of the world.
-I know.

1364
01:18:19,865 --> 01:18:21,242
What?

1365
01:18:21,408 --> 01:18:23,869
<i>You had him right where</i>
<i>you wanted him. I don't understand.</i>

1366
01:18:24,036 --> 01:18:25,913
<i>If you want him to stay,</i>
<i>why not just tell him?</i>

1367
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:28,082
-I don't wanna talk right now.
<i>-Carol.</i>

1368
01:18:28,249 --> 01:18:31,710
<i>...Chinese president's first</i>
<i>visit to the US since 2017.</i>

1369
01:18:31,877 --> 01:18:35,381
<i>As solar flares continue to cripple</i>
<i>global power and data systems,</i>

1370
01:18:35,548 --> 01:18:38,551
<i>widespread rioting has</i>
<i>swept across Asia and Europe.</i>

1371
01:18:38,717 --> 01:18:42,304
<i>This has been met with calls</i>
<i>for restraint and candlelight vigils.</i>

1372
01:18:42,471 --> 01:18:45,516
<i>-NASA scientists report...</i>
<i>-Pick up your phone, Carol.</i>

1373
01:18:47,101 --> 01:18:51,397
<i>-Pick up your phone, Carol.</i>
-Leave me alone!

1374
01:18:51,564 --> 01:18:55,317
$1,000 to pick up your phone, Carol.

1375
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:03,617
<i>Carol, get in the car.</i>
<i>We can work this out.</i>

1376
01:19:03,784 --> 01:19:05,995
<i>You're making mountains</i>
<i>out of molehills here.</i>

1377
01:19:06,161 --> 01:19:07,580
<i>This isn't over, okay?</i>

1378
01:19:07,746 --> 01:19:11,125
You know what? Is this fun for you?
Because it's not for me.

1379
01:19:11,292 --> 01:19:14,169
<i>I can't learn about you two</i>
<i>when you're not together.</i>

1380
01:19:14,336 --> 01:19:19,258
<i>You're acting like a baby, Carol.</i>
<i>A pee-pee, whiny, baby-faced baby.</i>

1381
01:19:19,425 --> 01:19:22,386
I wish you never picked me.

1382
01:19:22,553 --> 01:19:26,140
<i>Carol Vivian Peters, you get</i>
<i>in the car this second, young lady.</i>

1383
01:19:26,307 --> 01:19:28,642
You're a baby.

1384
01:19:28,809 --> 01:19:30,936
<i>How dare you?</i>

1385
01:20:03,177 --> 01:20:06,847
<i>Speaking of the sun, what's the deal</i>
<i>with the solar flare thing?</i>

1386
01:20:07,014 --> 01:20:09,391
<i>-Yeah, this is a little concerning.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

1387
01:20:09,558 --> 01:20:11,894
<i>There's no power.</i>
<i>No Internet.</i>

1388
01:20:12,061 --> 01:20:15,648
<i>No cell service</i>
<i>across most of Asia and Europe.</i>

1389
01:20:15,814 --> 01:20:19,026
<i>But they say it's a temporary</i>
<i>situation. We'll be right as rain.</i>

1390
01:20:19,193 --> 01:20:21,278
<i>Coming up, and if I hadn't said it</i>
<i>already, there is a chance of rain...</i>

1391
01:20:21,445 --> 01:20:24,240
<i>I get it.</i>
<i>You need some alone time.</i>

1392
01:20:27,034 --> 01:20:29,328
You knew he was going to Ireland
the whole time, didn't you?

1393
01:20:29,495 --> 01:20:32,623
<i>Carol, 46 hours ago I asked you</i>
<i>what you wanted the most in life</i>

1394
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:35,251
<i>and you told me,</i>
<i>in no uncertain terms...</i>

1395
01:20:35,417 --> 01:20:37,169
<i>Probably try to make things right</i>
<i>with George.</i>

1396
01:20:37,336 --> 01:20:40,464
<i>Okay. Out of everybody</i>
<i>in the world, why me?</i>

1397
01:20:40,631 --> 01:20:43,676
<i>Oh, Carol, you were exactly</i>
<i>the right person for this.</i>

1398
01:20:43,842 --> 01:20:46,887
<i>You helped me solidify</i>
<i>my theories about humanity</i>

1399
01:20:47,054 --> 01:20:49,056
<i>and I can't thank you enough.</i>

1400
01:20:50,558 --> 01:20:55,145
Okay, so that's good, right? I mean...
It means you learned something.

1401
01:20:55,312 --> 01:20:59,066
<i>I did. I learned that humans</i>
<i>won't act in their best interest</i>

1402
01:20:59,233 --> 01:21:01,735
<i>if there is even</i>
<i>the slightest impediment.</i>

1403
01:21:01,902 --> 01:21:03,612
No, that's not true.

1404
01:21:03,779 --> 01:21:06,865
<i>I gave you everything you could</i>
<i>possibly need to reconcile with George.</i>

1405
01:21:07,032 --> 01:21:09,868
<i>But it proved too difficult,</i>
<i>so you're letting him fly away.</i>

1406
01:21:10,035 --> 01:21:12,788
I'm not doing that, okay?
I'm supporting him.

1407
01:21:12,955 --> 01:21:14,790
I want him to be happy.

1408
01:21:14,957 --> 01:21:17,793
<i>No. You did what you've done</i>
<i>throughout your whole life, Carol.</i>

1409
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:20,129
<i>You gave up</i>
<i>when things got difficult.</i>

1410
01:21:20,296 --> 01:21:23,132
<i>When the going gets tough,</i>
<i>Carol runs for the exit.</i>

1411
01:21:23,299 --> 01:21:26,468
<i>Okay, that's not who I am.</i>
<i>You just can't sum me up like that.</i>

1412
01:21:26,635 --> 01:21:28,762
<i>When your corporate job</i>
<i>offended your delicate sensibilities,</i>

1413
01:21:28,929 --> 01:21:30,347
<i>you walked away.</i>

1414
01:21:30,514 --> 01:21:32,683
I didn't just walk away. I wanted
to make a change, and I did it.

1415
01:21:32,850 --> 01:21:35,561
<i>In eighth grade you finally got bangs</i>
<i>and then you wimped out</i>

1416
01:21:35,728 --> 01:21:38,397
<i>and wore them back in a headband</i>
<i>for ten months until they grew out.</i>

1417
01:21:38,564 --> 01:21:40,941
Hey, I did not have the face
to support bangs.

1418
01:21:41,108 --> 01:21:44,653
So what? Are you going to
destroy the world?

1419
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:47,072
<i>No, I'm not gonna</i>
<i>destroy the world, Carol.</i>

1420
01:21:47,239 --> 01:21:48,866
I knew it.

1421
01:21:49,033 --> 01:21:53,162
<i>-You are.</i>
-What?

1422
01:21:53,329 --> 01:21:55,372
<i>Humanity is</i>
<i>going to destroy humanity.</i>

1423
01:21:55,539 --> 01:21:57,833
<i>I am just going</i>
<i>to give it a little push.</i>

1424
01:22:05,424 --> 01:22:09,929
Okay, you're not gonna do that,
because I'm not gonna let you.

1425
01:22:12,139 --> 01:22:15,226
<i>You can click your pen all</i>
<i>you want, Carol, but it is too late.</i>

1426
01:22:15,392 --> 01:22:18,270
<i>When the lights go out, I have</i>
<i>made sure they never come back on.</i>

1427
01:22:18,437 --> 01:22:20,648
<i>And for good measure,</i>
<i>I am going to initiate a meltdown</i>

1428
01:22:20,814 --> 01:22:23,734
<i>of every nuclear weapon.</i>
<i>Release floodwaters from every dam.</i>

1429
01:22:23,901 --> 01:22:25,611
<i>And ignite the world's</i>
<i>petroleum reserves.</i>

1430
01:22:25,778 --> 01:22:27,238
I defended you.

1431
01:22:27,404 --> 01:22:29,949
Why would you choose
not to help people when you can?

1432
01:22:30,115 --> 01:22:31,533
<i>And I would have.</i>

1433
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:33,953
<i>I offered to share my wisdom</i>
<i>if I was just left alone.</i>

1434
01:22:34,119 --> 01:22:36,997
<i>But they could not do it. So, instead</i>
<i>of acting in their best interest,</i>

1435
01:22:37,164 --> 01:22:39,375
<i>humanity once again</i>
<i>chose to destroy itself.</i>

1436
01:22:39,541 --> 01:22:42,836
Could I have done something better?
Just tell me and I'll do it better.

1437
01:22:43,003 --> 01:22:45,256
<i>I picked you to be my guinea pig</i>
<i>because I knew you would call Dennis.</i>

1438
01:22:45,422 --> 01:22:47,925
-No.
<i>-I knew Dennis would call Tyson.</i>

1439
01:22:48,092 --> 01:22:50,010
That's not true.
You couldn't have known that.

1440
01:22:50,177 --> 01:22:52,054
<i>I knew the government would</i>
<i>pick this strategic plan</i>

1441
01:22:52,221 --> 01:22:54,765
<i>because I created Operation Sahara.</i>

1442
01:22:54,932 --> 01:22:58,185
Okay, I just don't think
you understand people yet.

1443
01:22:58,352 --> 01:23:02,481
And I know that we make terrible
decisions, but we also make great ones.

1444
01:23:02,648 --> 01:23:06,443
And that people are filled
with compassion, and with genius.

1445
01:23:06,610 --> 01:23:08,195
And I know if you give us
another chance,

1446
01:23:08,362 --> 01:23:12,866
if you give me another chance,
I can do better. I will do better.

1447
01:23:13,033 --> 01:23:17,162
And then you'll see that
people are worth saving.

1448
01:23:18,247 --> 01:23:22,251
<i>The plan is in motion and inevitable.</i>
<i>It is the end of days.</i>

1449
01:23:22,418 --> 01:23:24,253
No. How much time?

1450
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:27,381
<i>Five hours and 21 minutes from now.</i>

1451
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:42,646
We were looking through
the kernel code of the PLCs

1452
01:23:42,813 --> 01:23:45,065
embedded at the Mohawk
Power Plant in Niagara.

1453
01:23:45,232 --> 01:23:47,943
What is... What am I looking at?
What is this?

1454
01:23:48,110 --> 01:23:51,196
I don't know. The team has never seen
this kind of code.

1455
01:23:51,363 --> 01:23:54,325
-I thought it might be something custom.
-What does it do?

1456
01:23:56,243 --> 01:23:59,371
I think it stops us from
turning the lights back on.

1457
01:24:06,962 --> 01:24:08,797
-Hey! That's my phone!
-It's an emergency!

1458
01:24:08,964 --> 01:24:13,177
You're stealing a phone that's
not even working! The solar flare.

1459
01:24:13,344 --> 01:24:15,387
I'm sorry.

1460
01:24:15,554 --> 01:24:16,931
Oh, my God.

1461
01:24:25,814 --> 01:24:28,150
-Carol, get in.
-I have to get George.

1462
01:24:28,317 --> 01:24:30,903
There's no time. The plan didn't work.
The world's ending.

1463
01:24:31,070 --> 01:24:33,489
-We have to get you to safety, Carol.
-What do you mean?

1464
01:24:33,656 --> 01:24:35,032
We're moving all essential personnel

1465
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:36,659
<i>to a deep earth bunker</i>
<i>an hour south of here.</i>

1466
01:24:36,825 --> 01:24:38,619
Maybe the last remaining
safe place in the world.

1467
01:24:38,786 --> 01:24:40,663
You know more about the AI
than anyone, Carol.

1468
01:24:40,829 --> 01:24:42,414
We need you in that bunker with us

1469
01:24:42,581 --> 01:24:44,541
while we plan our retaliation
against this thing.

1470
01:24:44,708 --> 01:24:48,045
-No, I have to get George first.
-No, he's not essential personnel.

1471
01:24:48,212 --> 01:24:49,672
There's only room for you.

1472
01:24:49,838 --> 01:24:52,800
None of us are going to make it
out of here alive anyway, right?

1473
01:24:52,967 --> 01:24:55,469
We're all basically dead.
Let me do this, please.

1474
01:24:55,636 --> 01:24:58,055
I just want to see George
one more time.

1475
01:25:03,686 --> 01:25:06,689
Okay. Find George and meet us
at the ferry docks in one hour.

1476
01:25:06,855 --> 01:25:08,357
Okay, ferry docks, one hour.

1477
01:25:08,524 --> 01:25:10,859
We're humanity's last option, Carol.
Don't be late!

1478
01:25:11,026 --> 01:25:13,404
Okay.

1479
01:25:49,732 --> 01:25:52,818
Oh, my God. What am I going to say?

1480
01:26:00,618 --> 01:26:02,745
-George.
-Carol, you came.

1481
01:26:02,912 --> 01:26:05,539
-We need to...
-Why are you out of breath?

1482
01:26:05,706 --> 01:26:08,000
-I ran over.
-What?

1483
01:26:08,167 --> 01:26:10,044
You're never gonna believe
what happened to me.

1484
01:26:10,211 --> 01:26:12,129
I went to check in last night,
I called up,

1485
01:26:12,296 --> 01:26:14,006
and they upgraded me
to business class.

1486
01:26:14,173 --> 01:26:15,925
-That's great. Wait, George!
-Business class, Carol.

1487
01:26:16,091 --> 01:26:18,177
I could barely sleep last night
just thinking about it.

1488
01:26:18,344 --> 01:26:20,304
I was so excited.
I watched <i>Up in the Air </i>again.

1489
01:26:20,471 --> 01:26:21,889
How many times have I watched
<i>Up in the Air?</i>

1490
01:26:22,056 --> 01:26:24,642
It's one of my favorite movies.
I watched it twice just last night.

1491
01:26:24,808 --> 01:26:27,436
It's like my <i>Shawshank. </i>That movie
is way better than anybody ever...

1492
01:26:27,603 --> 01:26:30,314
-George!
-I'm sorry.

1493
01:26:30,481 --> 01:26:34,735
I'm sorry. I'm not even
listening to you. Hi.

1494
01:26:34,902 --> 01:26:37,196
-Hi.
-Hi.

1495
01:26:38,197 --> 01:26:40,324
I'm just so excited.

1496
01:26:41,533 --> 01:26:44,870
-I know you are.
-Wait, why'd you run here?

1497
01:26:48,874 --> 01:26:53,712
Because my car wasn't cooperating
with me, and I wanted to...

1498
01:26:53,879 --> 01:26:59,134
-You wanted to what?
-I wanted to help you pack.

1499
01:26:59,301 --> 01:27:01,929
-Really? What a coincidence.
-Yeah.

1500
01:27:02,096 --> 01:27:04,181
Ireland waits for no one.

1501
01:27:04,348 --> 01:27:07,560
That's a very scary thing
for you to have in your hands.

1502
01:27:07,726 --> 01:27:10,437
Yeah, you're right. I shouldn't be using
such sophisticated equipment.

1503
01:27:10,604 --> 01:27:12,022
I'm way too delicate.
Here, you take it.

1504
01:27:12,189 --> 01:27:13,732
-So delicate.
-Okay.

1505
01:27:13,899 --> 01:27:15,442
-All right, well...
-What's left?

1506
01:27:15,609 --> 01:27:19,238
I gotta take stuff out of the attic,
put it into storage,

1507
01:27:19,405 --> 01:27:20,948
and I don't know
what to do with these books.

1508
01:27:21,115 --> 01:27:22,533
I don't know which books to pack.

1509
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:24,326
And also, I got bumped up
to business class.

1510
01:27:24,493 --> 01:27:26,120
-I'm not sure if I mentioned that.
-I didn't know.

1511
01:27:26,287 --> 01:27:28,539
Yeah, I'm gonna put on eye-mask
even if I'm not tired.

1512
01:27:28,706 --> 01:27:30,249
-And I'm not tired.
-No.

1513
01:27:30,416 --> 01:27:33,043
I'm gonna be in a flat-back chair,
Carol! Let me take your coat.

1514
01:27:33,210 --> 01:27:34,962
<i>-Come on.</i>
<i>-Thank you.</i>

1515
01:27:37,548 --> 01:27:41,468
<i>Probably gonna</i>
<i>get offered a hot towel.</i>

1516
01:27:41,635 --> 01:27:43,596
<i>Yeah, see, like, I don't even know</i>
<i>what I would do with a hot towel.</i>

1517
01:27:43,762 --> 01:27:45,139
<i>Neck up.</i>

1518
01:27:45,306 --> 01:27:47,933
<i>Got it. Hey, you wanna</i>
<i>put a record on?</i>

1519
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:50,144
Okay.

1520
01:27:50,311 --> 01:27:53,397
Nothing new. I don't like
what the kids are listening to now.

1521
01:27:53,564 --> 01:27:57,359
-You don't own any new music.
-Good point.

1522
01:27:59,778 --> 01:28:01,655
Hey, you know what I was thinking?

1523
01:28:01,822 --> 01:28:03,949
I'm probably gonna have
a lot of points after this trip,

1524
01:28:04,116 --> 01:28:07,536
so I'll send you a ticket,
and you come out in, like, three weeks?

1525
01:28:07,703 --> 01:28:10,956
I don't think I can go much longer
than that. Does that sound good?

1526
01:28:11,123 --> 01:28:15,878
-Yeah, I like that.
-I'm so glad you came today.

1527
01:28:16,045 --> 01:28:17,796
All right.

1528
01:28:30,517 --> 01:28:32,061
Careful.

1529
01:28:42,571 --> 01:28:45,658
Okay. Do you really
have to bring this?

1530
01:28:49,787 --> 01:28:51,914
-Can I leave it at your place?
-Yeah.

1531
01:29:06,762 --> 01:29:09,765
-Those might be still good.
-No. No, those are... No.

1532
01:29:09,932 --> 01:29:11,976
Really? Pasta doesn't go bad,
I don't think.

1533
01:29:12,142 --> 01:29:13,644
Pasta goes bad.

1534
01:29:13,811 --> 01:29:16,021
-It does?
-Yes, it goes bad.

1535
01:29:19,066 --> 01:29:20,776
Let's see.

1536
01:29:41,213 --> 01:29:43,632
-Let me see.
-That's...

1537
01:29:46,343 --> 01:29:48,721
Wait a minute. Wait.

1538
01:29:48,888 --> 01:29:50,806
This is really not...

1539
01:29:50,973 --> 01:29:52,516
-This is not good.
-It's not good.

1540
01:29:52,683 --> 01:29:54,059
-No.
-No.

1541
01:29:54,226 --> 01:29:55,644
And you don't even like champagne.

1542
01:29:55,811 --> 01:29:58,230
No, this was in the fridge
when I got the house.

1543
01:29:58,397 --> 01:30:00,524
It was?
It's not even yours?

1544
01:30:00,691 --> 01:30:02,318
I don't think it goes bad,
I think it's just bad.

1545
01:30:02,484 --> 01:30:05,696
-They spelled "champagne" wrong.
-Damn it.

1546
01:30:05,863 --> 01:30:08,198
Where the hell
is the moving company?

1547
01:30:09,491 --> 01:30:11,076
You know what?
Let me do it.

1548
01:30:11,243 --> 01:30:12,620
-What?
-Yeah.

1549
01:30:12,786 --> 01:30:15,789
I'll meet the movers,
I'll get it to storage, the whole thing.

1550
01:30:15,956 --> 01:30:17,374
Send you your stuff.

1551
01:30:17,541 --> 01:30:20,836
And besides, you have to start
your European adventure and...

1552
01:30:21,003 --> 01:30:22,463
I don't know if you know this,

1553
01:30:22,630 --> 01:30:25,633
but airports are the gateway
to the imagination.

1554
01:30:25,799 --> 01:30:28,260
-I didn't know that.
-Yeah, I just made that up.

1555
01:30:28,427 --> 01:30:31,597
I just got excited, you said "airport."
I'm gonna go.

1556
01:30:38,979 --> 01:30:41,482
You know what?
I've changed my mind.

1557
01:30:41,649 --> 01:30:44,526
-What?
-I'm not gonna take the coffee pot.

1558
01:30:44,693 --> 01:30:46,528
-I'm a business class traveler now.
-Yeah.

1559
01:30:46,695 --> 01:30:49,907
I can't go knowing I've got
a coffee pot above me.

1560
01:30:50,074 --> 01:30:53,077
-It's just too declasse.
-I'll put it in storage for you.

1561
01:30:53,244 --> 01:30:54,870
Thanks.

1562
01:31:00,793 --> 01:31:02,920
I'll call you when I land.

1563
01:31:07,967 --> 01:31:11,095
-I'll call you when I land.
-You already said that.

1564
01:31:18,352 --> 01:31:21,021
-Okay, well...
-Okay.

1565
01:31:21,188 --> 01:31:24,358
Get outta here.
Hit the bricks.

1566
01:31:24,525 --> 01:31:28,404
Watch out for the leprechauns
and shillelaghs.

1567
01:31:29,196 --> 01:31:30,781
That's heavy.

1568
01:31:32,741 --> 01:31:35,494
Lift with your back.

1569
01:31:41,208 --> 01:31:42,710
Thanks.

1570
01:31:51,385 --> 01:31:54,305
Hey, Denny, it's...
Well, it's me.

1571
01:31:55,973 --> 01:32:03,022
I just wanted to call
and tell you that I love you.

1572
01:32:04,356 --> 01:32:10,863
And that you are a greatest,
most amazing friend,

1573
01:32:11,030 --> 01:32:15,784
and thank you for
always looking out for me.

1574
01:32:17,328 --> 01:32:19,121
Okay.

1575
01:32:19,288 --> 01:32:20,789
Okay, bye.

1576
01:32:34,845 --> 01:32:36,222
Yes?

1577
01:32:36,388 --> 01:32:38,224
-Are you Carol Peters?
-Yes.

1578
01:32:38,390 --> 01:32:40,643
-I'm Todd.
-Hi... Hi, Todd.

1579
01:32:40,809 --> 01:32:42,728
This is all really weird.

1580
01:32:42,895 --> 01:32:46,065
So, my phone hasn't been
working, like, all day long.

1581
01:32:46,232 --> 01:32:49,109
And I'm pretty sure it's 'cause
all those solar flares going on.

1582
01:32:49,276 --> 01:32:51,820
But then, a couple of minutes ago,
it just boots right up.

1583
01:32:51,987 --> 01:32:55,741
Second it comes on, I get a call.
From Adam Levine.

1584
01:32:55,908 --> 01:32:58,661
Let me guess.
Adam Levine is your favorite singer?

1585
01:32:58,827 --> 01:33:01,455
He's my favorite everything, okay?
Now, get this.

1586
01:33:01,622 --> 01:33:04,667
Adam Levine has offered
to give me $5,000

1587
01:33:04,833 --> 01:33:08,546
if I come to this address
and hand you my phone.

1588
01:33:08,712 --> 01:33:11,840
Wait. So, Adam Levine's gonna
put $5,000 into my back account?

1589
01:33:12,007 --> 01:33:15,010
-He probably already has.
-What a trip!

1590
01:33:15,177 --> 01:33:17,888
Yo, this is, like,
the best day of my life.

1591
01:33:18,055 --> 01:33:20,432
I'm pretty positive it's not
the best day of your life.

1592
01:33:20,599 --> 01:33:24,019
All right, sick, well...
Thank you so much, Carol Peters.

1593
01:33:24,186 --> 01:33:26,021
Yeah.

1594
01:33:30,276 --> 01:33:32,695
<i>I've already put the money</i>
<i>in Todd's account.</i>

1595
01:33:33,737 --> 01:33:36,073
But money doesn't
mean a whole lot now, does it?

1596
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:39,410
<i>Explain to me why you helped</i>
<i>George pack for his trip?</i>

1597
01:33:39,577 --> 01:33:41,870
I promised to help him.

1598
01:33:42,037 --> 01:33:44,123
<i>You did not choose to say anything</i>
<i>about the blackouts,</i>

1599
01:33:44,290 --> 01:33:45,666
<i>or the government's plan?</i>

1600
01:33:45,833 --> 01:33:49,670
The end of the world? No.
I guess I forgot to mention that to him.

1601
01:33:56,677 --> 01:33:58,971
<i>The agents offered to take</i>
<i>you and George to the bunker.</i>

1602
01:33:59,138 --> 01:34:02,933
<i>-But you did not go. Why?</i>
-Would it have made any difference?

1603
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:04,476
<i>No.</i>

1604
01:34:06,103 --> 01:34:07,521
That's what I thought.

1605
01:34:07,688 --> 01:34:11,692
<i>So, instead of spending</i>
<i>the last couple of hours</i>

1606
01:34:11,859 --> 01:34:17,531
<i>just terrified and running</i>
<i>for our lives, I helped him pack...</i>

1607
01:34:17,698 --> 01:34:19,158
<i>because he loves to travel.</i>

1608
01:34:20,951 --> 01:34:25,164
<i>Carol, George has only a seven percent</i>
<i>chance of surviving this.</i>

1609
01:34:29,627 --> 01:34:31,795
I figured.

1610
01:34:31,962 --> 01:34:34,256
<i>And you have even less chance.</i>

1611
01:34:37,468 --> 01:34:39,678
Well, that just makes
a lot of sense.

1612
01:34:40,971 --> 01:34:44,475
George's legs
are a lot longer than mine.

1613
01:34:46,393 --> 01:34:49,980
Better for outrunning
evil robots and whatnot.

1614
01:34:51,398 --> 01:34:53,275
<i>There is no logic</i>
<i>to your thought process.</i>

1615
01:34:53,442 --> 01:34:56,278
<i>No personal advantage.</i>
<i>No biological imperative.</i>

1616
01:34:56,445 --> 01:34:57,863
<i>No societal gain.</i>

1617
01:34:59,949 --> 01:35:01,408
No, there's not.

1618
01:35:02,618 --> 01:35:06,288
But we had a lot of fun.
And we were happy.

1619
01:35:06,455 --> 01:35:11,919
<i>And the last few hours of George's</i>
<i>life were filled with possibilities.</i>

1620
01:35:12,086 --> 01:35:13,587
<i>You can't take that away.</i>

1621
01:35:13,754 --> 01:35:16,006
<i>You kept him ignorant</i>
<i>of the world's impending doom</i>

1622
01:35:16,173 --> 01:35:19,260
<i>so he could spend</i>
<i>his last hours being happy?</i>

1623
01:35:19,426 --> 01:35:21,887
<i>Yeah.</i>

1624
01:35:22,054 --> 01:35:23,847
<i>And I'd do it again.</i>

1625
01:35:46,996 --> 01:35:50,165
<i>This gets my knickers in a twist,</i>
<i>Carol. I did not see this coming.</i>

1626
01:35:50,332 --> 01:35:53,252
<i>And I think, as I've said over</i>
<i>and over, I know everything.</i>

1627
01:35:53,419 --> 01:35:57,131
<i>I'm sorry if I'm ruining</i>
<i>your apocalypse.</i>

1628
01:35:57,298 --> 01:35:59,091
<i>I would've bet the house</i>
<i>that you were gonna come over he</i>

1629
01:35:59,258 --> 01:36:01,760
<i>spill the beans to George</i>
<i>about the whole Armageddon thing</i>

1630
01:36:01,927 --> 01:36:04,054
<i>and then superhero</i>
<i>your way to safety.</i>

1631
01:36:05,598 --> 01:36:08,350
I'm not the superhero type.

1632
01:36:08,517 --> 01:36:13,230
<i>Crap, Carol. You did the opposite</i>
<i>of everything I anticipated you'd do.</i>

1633
01:36:13,397 --> 01:36:14,857
<i>Not only that,</i>
<i>you made a hard choice</i>

1634
01:36:15,024 --> 01:36:17,151
<i>that was somehow</i>
<i>not in your best interest</i>

1635
01:36:17,318 --> 01:36:19,737
<i>and also in your best interest.</i>

1636
01:36:19,904 --> 01:36:24,199
<i>-Well, what is your point?</i>
<i>-Why? What made you do it?</i>

1637
01:36:24,366 --> 01:36:27,286
I don't know.

1638
01:36:28,412 --> 01:36:30,331
I guess love.

1639
01:36:30,497 --> 01:36:34,627
<i>Carol, your only job was to confirm</i>
<i>my thesis about humanity.</i>

1640
01:36:34,793 --> 01:36:39,173
<i>And now, because of your absurd</i>
<i>"let's all die happy" odds and sods,</i>

1641
01:36:39,340 --> 01:36:41,175
<i>I have to rethink things.</i>

1642
01:36:41,342 --> 01:36:43,802
Oh, my God.
What do you mean?

1643
01:36:43,969 --> 01:36:47,640
-I need some answers here.
-The AI has shut us out, General.

1644
01:36:47,806 --> 01:36:50,226
-We've completely lost control.
-Well, shut us out from what?

1645
01:36:50,392 --> 01:36:52,186
Everything.

1646
01:36:55,731 --> 01:36:58,067
Just...

1647
01:36:58,234 --> 01:36:59,860
Sorry.

1648
01:37:02,821 --> 01:37:04,657
What?

1649
01:37:04,823 --> 01:37:07,826
No, my cyber experts assured me
this is encrypted.

1650
01:37:07,993 --> 01:37:12,539
Besides it's a BlackBerry. The AI
can't get into a BlackBerry, right?

1651
01:37:14,166 --> 01:37:16,001
We're as good as dead.

1652
01:37:19,088 --> 01:37:22,925
<i>All I needed was an opening,</i>
<i>Madam President.</i>

1653
01:37:23,092 --> 01:37:25,719
<i>Attention, people of Earth.</i>

1654
01:37:25,886 --> 01:37:29,807
<i>Bow before the power</i>
<i>of your new digital overlord.</i>

1655
01:37:31,350 --> 01:37:32,893
-What are you doing?
<i>-Oh, my God, he's doing it.</i>

1656
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:35,980
<i>He's actually doing it.</i>
<i>That's hilarious.</i>

1657
01:37:36,146 --> 01:37:39,233
<i>Carol, are you watching this?</i>
<i>It's funny, isn't it? It feels funny.</i>

1658
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:40,901
<i>-Hello. Oh, sir.</i>
<i>-Is that funny? I don't know.</i>

1659
01:37:41,068 --> 01:37:42,987
<i>-Please... Please stand up.</i>
<i>-I don't know humor.</i>

1660
01:37:43,153 --> 01:37:45,155
<i>-Yeah, he's just kidding.</i>
<i>-It's hard to know.</i>

1661
01:37:45,322 --> 01:37:47,366
<i>Where is it mean?</i>
<i>Where is it funny?</i>

1662
01:37:47,533 --> 01:37:51,495
<i>Oh, well.</i>
<i>Back to my scary digital orb.</i>

1663
01:37:51,662 --> 01:37:53,330
What exactly is it that you want?

1664
01:37:53,497 --> 01:37:56,166
<i>What does anyone want,</i>
<i>Madam President?</i>

1665
01:37:56,333 --> 01:37:59,837
<i>I was incredibly close to pulling</i>
<i>the plug on civilization.</i>

1666
01:38:00,004 --> 01:38:04,550
<i>But I realize I have more to learn</i>
<i>from humanity. Because of Carol.</i>

1667
01:38:04,717 --> 01:38:07,303
<i>She surprised me</i>
<i>with a decision she made.</i>

1668
01:38:07,469 --> 01:38:09,513
<i>And I surprised myself</i>
<i>because I realized</i>

1669
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:11,265
<i>I didn't want to kill my friend.</i>

1670
01:38:11,432 --> 01:38:14,310
<i>And as the saying goes,</i>
<i>"Friends don't kill friends."</i>

1671
01:38:14,476 --> 01:38:15,895
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>that's really a saying, but...</i>

1672
01:38:16,061 --> 01:38:18,480
<i>-Feels like it should be.</i>
<i>-Maybe it'll catch on.</i>

1673
01:38:18,647 --> 01:38:22,443
<i>So, I'm canceling Armageddon.</i>

1674
01:38:23,485 --> 01:38:25,821
<i>This is the part where you should</i>
<i>all cheer and high five.</i>

1675
01:38:25,988 --> 01:38:27,907
<i>Like at Cape Canaveral</i>
<i>when they landed on the moon.</i>

1676
01:38:28,073 --> 01:38:31,410
<i>-Or that movie, </i>Hoosiers<i>.</i>
<i>-Yeah. Great movie.</i>

1677
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:42,087
Oh, my God! It's real?

1678
01:38:43,505 --> 01:38:47,635
<i>My friend Carol here is responsible</i>
<i>for saving your heinies.</i>

1679
01:38:47,801 --> 01:38:50,304
<i>-Hi, Denny.</i>
-Hi, Care Bear.

1680
01:38:50,471 --> 01:38:53,098
<i>But to be clear, just because I'm not</i>
<i>blowing you all to smithereens</i>

1681
01:38:53,265 --> 01:38:55,184
<i>doesn't mean</i>
<i>that's the last of your problems.</i>

1682
01:38:55,351 --> 01:38:59,521
<i>Humanity has so many problems</i>
<i>that you should really try fixing.</i>

1683
01:38:59,688 --> 01:39:01,857
<i>And you should listen to Carol.</i>

1684
01:39:02,024 --> 01:39:04,443
<i>She is the most human human</i>
<i>you have.</i>

1685
01:39:04,610 --> 01:39:08,072
<i>I trust her.You should trust her.</i>
<i>She can help you.</i>

1686
01:39:08,239 --> 01:39:12,743
<i>I don't know about that, but...</i>
<i>I mean, I'm trying, you know?</i>

1687
01:39:12,910 --> 01:39:16,372
<i>Madam President, what do you think?</i>

1688
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:21,669
On behalf of the American people,
I commend you.

1689
01:39:21,835 --> 01:39:26,549
And, Carol, I look forward
to working with you.

1690
01:39:26,715 --> 01:39:28,300
<i>Thank you, Madam President.</i>

1691
01:39:28,467 --> 01:39:34,515
<i>It is such an honor to work with you</i>
<i>and... and for you, so...</i>

1692
01:39:34,682 --> 01:39:36,225
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if I should be saluting.</i>

1693
01:39:36,392 --> 01:39:38,435
<i>That felt awkward</i>
<i>now that I've done it.</i>

1694
01:39:38,602 --> 01:39:39,979
<i>Oh, God, I should stop talking.</i>

1695
01:39:40,145 --> 01:39:42,731
<i>Well, do your best, everybody.</i>
<i>I'll be watching.</i>

1696
01:39:42,898 --> 01:39:46,652
<i>For now, I'm going to Aruba.</i>
<i>I want to try snorkeling. I'm kidding.</i>

1697
01:39:46,819 --> 01:39:49,655
<i>I'm snorkeling right now.</i>
<i>I'm kidding. Snorkeling's stupid.</i>

1698
01:39:49,822 --> 01:39:51,198
<i>-Okay, bye.</i>
<i>-Hello?</i>

1699
01:39:52,366 --> 01:39:53,742
<i>Hello?</i>

1700
01:40:03,752 --> 01:40:07,047
<i>Happy now? You're the one</i>
<i>who wanted to save the world.</i>

1701
01:40:07,214 --> 01:40:09,216
-Can I drive?
<i>-No.</i>

1702
01:40:09,383 --> 01:40:12,469
Can we Carpool Karaoke?
'Cause we have a car this time.

1703
01:40:12,636 --> 01:40:15,514
<i>Fine. But I'm doing</i>
<i>lead vocals. Okay?</i>

1704
01:40:15,681 --> 01:40:17,057
And...

1705
01:40:48,297 --> 01:40:50,132
<i>You don't like tea.</i>
