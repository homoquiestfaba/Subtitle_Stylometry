1
00:00:13,298 --> 00:00:16,340
- [Female] Make mental pictures every day.

2
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,140
(dramatic music)

3
00:00:36,234 --> 00:00:37,773
- Girls!

4
00:00:37,823 --> 00:00:40,162
(hollering)

5
00:00:40,212 --> 00:00:43,379
Here ya go, come see our show tonight.

6
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:45,824
Girls.

7
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:51,008
Hi, how are you guys?

8
00:00:54,918 --> 00:00:55,751
Hi.

9
00:00:56,607 --> 00:00:59,024
(chattering)

10
00:01:04,447 --> 00:01:07,197
(dramatic music)

11
00:03:40,577 --> 00:03:41,410
- Lemur.

12
00:03:43,493 --> 00:03:44,993
- Like the animal?

13
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,850
I think this is a big mistake.

14
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:54,508
- What about my 200?

15
00:03:54,558 --> 00:03:55,475
- Your 200?

16
00:03:56,333 --> 00:04:00,500
- Making a mistake costs just
as much as not making it.

17
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:03,595
- They already charged my card.

18
00:04:03,645 --> 00:04:06,562
- I don't leave until I get my 200.

19
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:24,334
You stupid son of a bitch.

20
00:04:24,384 --> 00:04:27,301
- Let's just call it a night, okay?

21
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:30,804
- $200 just like Lemur.

22
00:04:32,661 --> 00:04:35,484
- What is your name, Chipmunk?

23
00:04:35,534 --> 00:04:36,367
- Nancy.

24
00:04:38,634 --> 00:04:39,467
- Nancy.

25
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:43,913
- Look, give me my fucking money.

26
00:04:51,955 --> 00:04:52,788
Loser.

27
00:04:57,477 --> 00:04:59,633
- That's all I wanted to
know, The Comedy Spot.

28
00:04:59,683 --> 00:05:03,485
I'm checking out right now,
I just I have to get dressed.

29
00:05:03,535 --> 00:05:05,959
Give me a second, this
place isn't that bad.

30
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:08,150
It's actually kinda nice.

31
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,869
Downtown Vegas gets a bad rep man.

32
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:13,241
I know it's gonna be gorgeous.

33
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,760
That doesn't make this place a dump, okay?

34
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,452
Comedy Spot, our hotel.

35
00:05:17,502 --> 00:05:19,585
Roger out, mother fucker.

36
00:05:36,072 --> 00:05:37,989
- It's just my husband.

37
00:05:50,428 --> 00:05:51,428
No, stop it.

38
00:05:53,442 --> 00:05:55,197
Yeah and you were drunk then too.

39
00:05:55,247 --> 00:05:56,056
- I'll let you know...

40
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,830
- Shh, stop not here!

41
00:06:01,692 --> 00:06:03,735
- I paid per minute.

42
00:06:03,785 --> 00:06:04,568
- Really?

43
00:06:04,618 --> 00:06:05,451
- Mm-hm.

44
00:06:07,564 --> 00:06:08,397
- Stop it!

45
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,463
No, stop.

46
00:06:16,868 --> 00:06:17,701
Please.

47
00:06:19,627 --> 00:06:22,536
- Hey, if I'm so allergic,
why do you keep marrying me

48
00:06:22,586 --> 00:06:25,437
to all my female friends?

49
00:06:25,487 --> 00:06:27,381
- Because if snatch is camouflaged,

50
00:06:27,431 --> 00:06:29,858
marriage is invisibility.

51
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:31,524
You're a coward.

52
00:06:31,574 --> 00:06:32,716
Hence.

53
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:33,683
- Fuck you.

54
00:06:36,848 --> 00:06:39,072
- You know, Jesus tried to get
a room here in the wee hours,

55
00:06:39,096 --> 00:06:42,413
tossed three nails on the front desk.

56
00:06:42,463 --> 00:06:44,125
- Did he put me up for the night?

57
00:06:44,175 --> 00:06:45,746
It's older than Mt. Olympus.

58
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:47,067
- Wait for the laughs.

59
00:06:47,117 --> 00:06:49,842
- Hand jobs with holes in his hands?

60
00:06:49,892 --> 00:06:52,061
- Yeah, well executing
queers wouldn't be Uganda's

61
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,889
claim to fame if
Bible-thumpers were extinct.

62
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:57,689
- So go after it with some taste.

63
00:06:59,888 --> 00:07:01,191
- Per Ava.

64
00:07:01,241 --> 00:07:03,735
- There's worse things than
giving a shit about something.

65
00:07:03,785 --> 00:07:06,950
- Unless maybe it's
Judeo-Christian fascism.

66
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,424
- Which she would despise
as much as anyone.

67
00:07:09,474 --> 00:07:11,668
- A dual conversion.

68
00:07:11,718 --> 00:07:15,312
From secular cynicism and
sodomy, to the holy forgiveness,

69
00:07:15,362 --> 00:07:17,405
smack dab between her legs.

70
00:07:17,455 --> 00:07:18,288
Ah-la.

71
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:21,330
- Fuck you again.

72
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,988
- You looked conjugal
as hell at the funeral.

73
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:28,384
Arm and arm, before the
dirt even hit the box.

74
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:31,113
- Who could replace Mike.

75
00:07:31,163 --> 00:07:32,992
Who's even trying?

76
00:07:33,042 --> 00:07:35,959
- Who died literally in the closet?

77
00:07:37,438 --> 00:07:39,221
- [Nathaniel] Uh, waitress?

78
00:07:39,271 --> 00:07:41,538
- You think you're the first
fag to pull down a pair

79
00:07:41,588 --> 00:07:44,724
of panties to prove how normal you are?

80
00:07:44,774 --> 00:07:45,861
- What do you want?

81
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:50,078
- [Comic] Just because you
can, doesn't mean you want to.

82
00:08:09,008 --> 00:08:10,008
- Forget it.

83
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:14,384
- Enough with the gynecology.

84
00:08:15,282 --> 00:08:17,782
It's not a pap smear, sweetie.

85
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:21,959
I want that bonus.

86
00:08:40,582 --> 00:08:43,348
I'm not gonna let you down.

87
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,680
- Fuck me if Rachel Maddow
has (mumbles) used it.

88
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,463
Uganda, be kidding me,
my ass, it's every where.

89
00:08:49,513 --> 00:08:50,886
- Fundraisers are great.

90
00:08:50,936 --> 00:08:53,586
But maybe the persecution
is closer to home.

91
00:08:53,636 --> 00:08:54,553
You on you.

92
00:08:55,418 --> 00:08:57,835
- It's couple, husband, wife.

93
00:09:01,486 --> 00:09:02,319
- Who?

94
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,596
- This fucking idiot, drunk.

95
00:09:04,646 --> 00:09:08,094
Messin' around with his wife and it just

96
00:09:08,144 --> 00:09:10,781
keeps getting creepier
'cause he looks so stupid.

97
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:14,438
And I'm like, why is she with him?

98
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:16,142
He's like inching up her skirt.

99
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:18,525
And he called her fly paper.

100
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:24,492
His perfectly normal,
perfectly hot wife to die for.

101
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:27,120
- What the fuck was it
downtown or something?

102
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,558
- I heard junk with something
he couldn't get out of.

103
00:09:29,608 --> 00:09:31,846
- What were they fighting about?

104
00:09:31,896 --> 00:09:33,455
The couple?

105
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:35,443
Eh, you know what, never mind.

106
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:37,295
They're misery quotient.

107
00:09:37,345 --> 00:09:40,091
Like all married couples.

108
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:44,308
It's a sign, I'm telling
you, you're no switch hitter.

109
00:09:47,995 --> 00:09:49,745
- Tell that to these.

110
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,945
- I don't normally speak
to the heavens as you can

111
00:09:53,995 --> 00:09:55,840
probably tell.

112
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,457
- The hooker from last night.

113
00:09:58,507 --> 00:10:01,814
- Midnight cowboy, maybe, cowgirl, uh-uh.

114
00:10:01,864 --> 00:10:04,798
- Hey, if I'm so allergic,
why do you keep marrying me

115
00:10:04,848 --> 00:10:06,931
to all my female friends?

116
00:10:09,499 --> 00:10:12,416
- Ah, the little engine that could.

117
00:10:16,724 --> 00:10:19,421
- You forgot something.

118
00:10:19,471 --> 00:10:22,638
- Yeah, you're gonna wanna keep those.

119
00:10:23,494 --> 00:10:24,327
So.

120
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:31,326
Did I earn a little something,
teensy-weensy extra?

121
00:10:33,677 --> 00:10:34,622
- With your bonuses?

122
00:10:34,672 --> 00:10:38,672
I mean, I charged the
credit card for two grand.

123
00:10:42,381 --> 00:10:45,048
- So, a little itsy-bitsy extra?

124
00:10:47,517 --> 00:10:51,517
For throwing your chi all
over the fucking room.

125
00:11:04,937 --> 00:11:08,437
- I haven't done a play since high school.

126
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:11,867
Yeah but you shouldn't make
commitments for other people,

127
00:11:11,891 --> 00:11:12,724
even Ava.

128
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,637
Hold on, I have another call.

129
00:11:18,904 --> 00:11:19,737
Ava?

130
00:11:21,577 --> 00:11:25,224
Hold on, I'm on the phone with my mom.

131
00:11:25,274 --> 00:11:27,441
Mom, I gotta go, it's her.

132
00:11:30,936 --> 00:11:31,769
What's up?

133
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,234
(knocking)

134
00:11:36,731 --> 00:11:37,564
- Ta-da!

135
00:11:39,355 --> 00:11:41,483
I wanted to see your show tonight.

136
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:42,366
Hi.

137
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:51,108
And believe me, it was a pain,
the flight was ridiculous.

138
00:11:51,158 --> 00:11:54,381
I saw the posters and ducked
my head in the lounge.

139
00:11:54,431 --> 00:11:57,014
It's a cute, cozy little venue.

140
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:15,531
We don't have to leave
early, early in the morning,

141
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:17,248
do we, say we don't.

142
00:12:31,323 --> 00:12:32,923
We're three sheets, man.

143
00:12:32,973 --> 00:12:35,414
Me, you and fucked up it.

144
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:39,631
She says pushing that
(mumbles) all there was to it.

145
00:12:47,496 --> 00:12:48,746
All over again.

146
00:12:56,212 --> 00:12:58,892
Stop looking at me like I'm a specimen.

147
00:12:58,942 --> 00:13:00,388
- I'm not.

148
00:13:00,438 --> 00:13:02,989
- You always are looking
at me like I'm some sort

149
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,598
of a specimen.

150
00:13:04,648 --> 00:13:08,815
And now, you're working up
to say, about last night.

151
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:11,453
- Shouldn't I?

152
00:13:11,503 --> 00:13:12,836
- You shouldn't.

153
00:13:14,815 --> 00:13:17,056
- What are we even doing here?

154
00:13:17,106 --> 00:13:19,968
- Fine, let's change and go then.

155
00:13:20,018 --> 00:13:22,871
- I wanted them to tone it down.

156
00:13:22,921 --> 00:13:26,114
For people like you and
not specifically you but...

157
00:13:26,164 --> 00:13:27,211
- Like me?

158
00:13:27,261 --> 00:13:30,909
So if you were bigger than I don't know,

159
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,408
the Grand Canyon, would it
can't be a little lounge show

160
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,375
in Vegas really matter?

161
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:41,649
Love you, jackass.

162
00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:06,939
- Executing them is damn extreme.

163
00:14:07,801 --> 00:14:09,051
- A little bit?

164
00:14:11,202 --> 00:14:12,717
- You think?

165
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:14,412
You know it'll do you good
to get away from those

166
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,459
screwballs in California for awhile.

167
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:17,829
- I don't mean to be rude here...

168
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:21,286
- You know, not that we
don't have a few of our own.

169
00:14:21,336 --> 00:14:24,586
- I'm trying to get my lines down here.

170
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:30,192
- Let's see what good old
Jesus H has to say about it.

171
00:14:30,242 --> 00:14:31,159
Who's Bart?

172
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:36,703
There's a gospel according to Bart?

173
00:14:36,753 --> 00:14:39,022
- Can I have that back?

174
00:14:39,072 --> 00:14:41,322
- Happened to me in Saigon.

175
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:45,764
Thought he was just a good buddy.

176
00:14:45,814 --> 00:14:48,153
- The dog needs a walk, Nathaniel.

177
00:14:48,203 --> 00:14:50,644
- They take it hard, too.

178
00:14:50,694 --> 00:14:53,915
The whole world's against
me, that sort of thing.

179
00:14:53,965 --> 00:14:56,400
- Or commit suicide.

180
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,450
- Nathaniel.

181
00:14:59,113 --> 00:14:59,946
- What?

182
00:15:02,226 --> 00:15:04,537
- Do you have any sense?

183
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:05,370
I'll go with you.

184
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,203
- Where?

185
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:09,003
- Does anybody hear a word I say?

186
00:15:10,713 --> 00:15:12,546
We're walking the dog.

187
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:22,426
Don't listen to him.

188
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,473
- Enjoying the wrestling?

189
00:15:34,015 --> 00:15:37,049
Brutus will take down
Julius, I promise you.

190
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:39,766
Look how he goes after his legs.

191
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:43,563
Are you from these parts?

192
00:15:43,613 --> 00:15:46,452
- I'm from Caesarea, originally Rome.

193
00:15:46,502 --> 00:15:48,699
- Romans rule the world, eh?

194
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:51,286
Invariable handsome, too.

195
00:15:51,336 --> 00:15:53,762
- You're pretty handsome yourself.

196
00:15:53,812 --> 00:15:56,050
- In need of a massage.

197
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,330
- 'Kay, let's flip it.

198
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,297
Nathaniel, you're Bart,
from where we left off.

199
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,138
- Would you like to visit
my place overlooking the

200
00:16:04,162 --> 00:16:06,074
Sea of Tiberius?

201
00:16:06,124 --> 00:16:09,561
- It's tempting, I prefer my own.

202
00:16:09,611 --> 00:16:11,444
Those of circumcision.

203
00:16:12,354 --> 00:16:13,982
- Why, my mother was a Jew.

204
00:16:14,032 --> 00:16:16,855
She had me done on the
eighth day after my birth.

205
00:16:16,905 --> 00:16:18,948
- Then you most definitely
have my permission to

206
00:16:18,998 --> 00:16:21,052
enter my inner sanctum.

207
00:16:21,102 --> 00:16:23,352
(laughing)

208
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,470
- My little Betsy-wetsy.

209
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,520
- Mr. Waite.

210
00:16:54,252 --> 00:16:55,502
Mr. Can't wait.

211
00:16:58,487 --> 00:16:59,747
You're gonna love it.

212
00:16:59,797 --> 00:17:02,214
- I should for $1800 a month.

213
00:17:04,265 --> 00:17:07,275
Hey, a girl needs a
little help now and again.

214
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:09,076
That's okay.

215
00:17:09,126 --> 00:17:11,126
- Like you do sometimes?

216
00:17:15,555 --> 00:17:16,687
- [Mr. Waite] A little blue pill?

217
00:17:16,711 --> 00:17:17,998
- That little blue pill.

218
00:17:18,048 --> 00:17:21,155
- Hey, a little extra
starch never hurt a guy.

219
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:23,455
(laughing)

220
00:17:35,282 --> 00:17:36,532
Love you, baby.

221
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:47,365
I guess, it's pretty much
like what you do out there in

222
00:17:47,415 --> 00:17:51,582
the smog, producing, I mean
a team's a team, right?

223
00:17:52,547 --> 00:17:54,800
- I'm thinking about asking and I know it.

224
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,894
- Your mom told me.

225
00:17:56,944 --> 00:17:59,010
- Mom doesn't know.

226
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,263
- Entertainment law.

227
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:03,178
- Well, yeah, but it's something else.

228
00:18:03,228 --> 00:18:05,809
- Oh look at this son of a bitch.

229
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:10,026
That's all I need is OSHA
up my ass with a flashlight.

230
00:18:11,138 --> 00:18:14,805
- I'm thinking about
asking Ava to marry me.

231
00:18:16,441 --> 00:18:17,774
- Oh, thank God.

232
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,003
I mean, she's beautiful.

233
00:18:23,053 --> 00:18:26,470
I wouldn't want you to let that get away.

234
00:18:27,989 --> 00:18:31,739
Oh seriously, I'm gonna
fire this cocksucker.

235
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,823
(whistling)

236
00:18:34,873 --> 00:18:37,040
- Your shirt's unbuttoned.

237
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,705
- Bring her to lunch.

238
00:18:49,251 --> 00:18:51,516
- This is bullshit, there are
plenty of other secretaries

239
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:53,233
at the real offices.

240
00:18:57,045 --> 00:18:59,017
- This is (mumbles).

241
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:01,400
- (mumbles)

242
00:19:03,658 --> 00:19:05,697
- Kinda big for a car.

243
00:19:05,747 --> 00:19:07,390
- [Nathaniel] I don't know, a backhoe?

244
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,574
- [Ava] With these floors?

245
00:19:08,624 --> 00:19:11,124
Seriously, what is this place?

246
00:19:15,861 --> 00:19:18,861
- See, there's nothing fucking here.

247
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,363
- Be careful.

248
00:19:23,383 --> 00:19:25,716
Okay, pull the car over now.

249
00:19:27,222 --> 00:19:29,676
What is going on with you?

250
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:32,349
- I saw him the other day.

251
00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:35,905
He couldn't keep his hands off of her.

252
00:19:35,955 --> 00:19:38,067
- Does your mother know?

253
00:19:38,117 --> 00:19:40,411
Maybe you should let me drive.

254
00:19:40,461 --> 00:19:42,304
Maybe you should call.

255
00:19:42,354 --> 00:19:45,861
Cancel, I don't know, make something up.

256
00:19:45,911 --> 00:19:47,226
Was I supposed to turn?

257
00:19:47,276 --> 00:19:49,443
(mumbles)

258
00:20:08,654 --> 00:20:09,978
- So.

259
00:20:10,028 --> 00:20:11,562
- So.

260
00:20:11,612 --> 00:20:12,445
- So.

261
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:15,656
- Nathaniel says you're
active in your church.

262
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,879
- I am.

263
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:19,271
- I'm a hypocrite
myself, like most people.

264
00:20:19,321 --> 00:20:22,355
But, I like that forgiveness angle.

265
00:20:22,405 --> 00:20:24,431
- That's important.

266
00:20:24,481 --> 00:20:28,885
- Linguistics, so what do you
want to be when you grow up?

267
00:20:28,935 --> 00:20:32,212
- Well I studied poly sci in undergrad.

268
00:20:32,262 --> 00:20:33,045
- Where?

269
00:20:33,095 --> 00:20:34,383
- UW.

270
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:35,610
- Nathaniel.

271
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,186
- UW, what do you care?

272
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:39,647
- [Hostess] Hey how are
you guys doing today?

273
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:40,504
- Thanks.

274
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:45,182
- Your waitress will be
with you in just a minute.

275
00:20:45,232 --> 00:20:46,232
- Thank you.

276
00:20:49,869 --> 00:20:52,369
Yup, University of Washington.

277
00:20:53,678 --> 00:20:56,427
Big mystery why I came back
AZ State for my doc work.

278
00:20:56,477 --> 00:20:57,727
I love Seattle.

279
00:20:59,127 --> 00:21:00,877
- I need my sunshine.

280
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:03,912
- I miss the ocean.

281
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,276
- So maybe as your prof
for some withered up old

282
00:21:09,326 --> 00:21:13,159
chicken hawk in congress,
something like that.

283
00:21:18,071 --> 00:21:22,559
- You don't have to tell me
about chicken shit politicians.

284
00:21:22,609 --> 00:21:25,274
You ever hear of the Battle of Hue?

285
00:21:25,324 --> 00:21:26,491
Perfume River.

286
00:21:27,616 --> 00:21:30,650
It was in a place not called Disneyland.

287
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,231
1968.

288
00:21:32,281 --> 00:21:33,781
- [Nathaniel] Dad.

289
00:21:36,547 --> 00:21:39,512
- No silver spoons
tucked in my yap either.

290
00:21:39,562 --> 00:21:40,895
I was a jarhead.

291
00:21:44,951 --> 00:21:47,079
I didn't have a University
of Southern California

292
00:21:47,129 --> 00:21:49,610
theatrical background.

293
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,857
- What do you want me to do then, nothing?

294
00:21:51,907 --> 00:21:54,574
In honor of what I know you did?

295
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,318
- Yeah, that was me a lot.

296
00:21:57,368 --> 00:22:00,618
I damn well know that better than most.

297
00:22:02,017 --> 00:22:04,582
But those VC, they were some monster

298
00:22:04,632 --> 00:22:07,473
mother fuckers themselves.

299
00:22:07,523 --> 00:22:08,356
- Dad.

300
00:22:20,921 --> 00:22:23,030
- While those whorey old
bureaucrats you're talking about

301
00:22:23,054 --> 00:22:27,523
sip cocktails, told one
another about how they nailed

302
00:22:27,573 --> 00:22:30,667
down deferments for their spoiled brats.

303
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:34,495
Hemming and hauling about
etiquette of the lawless lunatic

304
00:22:34,545 --> 00:22:38,589
bullshit they were about to
unleash in Cambodia and Laos.

305
00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:41,639
- I shouldn't have been so flippant.

306
00:22:45,241 --> 00:22:47,806
- Par for the course nowadays though.

307
00:22:47,856 --> 00:22:50,920
New American century and all that.

308
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,333
Self perpetuating bullshit
for fun and profit.

309
00:22:54,383 --> 00:22:56,154
- End times, huh?

310
00:22:56,204 --> 00:23:00,204
- He's packing his kid's
bags for round two, eh?

311
00:23:07,342 --> 00:23:11,425
- You could have water
boated me instead I guess.

312
00:23:17,111 --> 00:23:19,096
Hi, I'm Bart, the gay apostle.

313
00:23:19,146 --> 00:23:21,543
I'm from Canaan, used to
spend almost all my time

314
00:23:21,593 --> 00:23:24,700
when I wasn't working in a
Roman bathhouse in Tiberias

315
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,561
on the Sea of Galilee.

316
00:23:26,611 --> 00:23:28,607
First I'd like to mention
I'm a Jew and had sex with

317
00:23:28,631 --> 00:23:32,798
good looking men for most, good
looking men most every day.

318
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:36,476
Definitely on weekends.

319
00:23:36,526 --> 00:23:40,241
I used to go to a gym to
see Greco-Roman wrestlers.

320
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:42,345
One thing would lead to
another and I'd find myself on

321
00:23:42,369 --> 00:23:46,545
my back, the happy recipient
of much genetic batter.

322
00:23:46,595 --> 00:23:49,601
Being a Jew, I'd only
allow the properly sniffed.

323
00:23:49,651 --> 00:23:52,035
The unopened collar of the
Gentile flesh was my only

324
00:23:52,085 --> 00:23:53,895
line of resistance.

325
00:23:53,945 --> 00:23:56,112
I was bothered for the
tourists seemed to forbid the

326
00:23:56,162 --> 00:23:57,964
very things I accepted nightly.

327
00:23:58,014 --> 00:23:59,329
What was I to do?

328
00:23:59,379 --> 00:24:01,576
Well a man comes up to
me, no more than 30,

329
00:24:01,626 --> 00:24:05,176
I'd say and says to me and this other guy,

330
00:24:05,226 --> 00:24:09,967
"Come follow me and I'll
make you fishers of men."

331
00:24:10,017 --> 00:24:12,413
How could I refuse
pulling men from the sea?

332
00:24:12,463 --> 00:24:15,244
Especially if they're good looking.

333
00:24:15,294 --> 00:24:17,521
- I don't see that.

334
00:24:17,571 --> 00:24:18,738
- My addition.

335
00:24:19,788 --> 00:24:20,621
- Keep it.

336
00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:24,260
Where is our esteemed director?

337
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,782
- [Nathaniel] Any minute.

338
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:27,916
- Congratulations.

339
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:28,799
Bart.

340
00:24:29,897 --> 00:24:30,730
Nathaniel.

341
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,319
- [Nathaniel] Thank you.

342
00:24:33,369 --> 00:24:36,548
- And playing our Lord and
Savior isn't exactly second best.

343
00:24:36,598 --> 00:24:39,606
- I'm event planning the
rapture with Nathaniel here.

344
00:24:39,656 --> 00:24:41,754
Someone who has some
experience in the field.

345
00:24:41,804 --> 00:24:45,580
- Off with your clothes, serpent lover!

346
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,463
- Yikes.

347
00:24:48,433 --> 00:24:50,785
- Blessed are the poor in spirit.

348
00:24:50,835 --> 00:24:52,679
- I am poor in spirit.

349
00:24:52,729 --> 00:24:54,641
- For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

350
00:24:54,691 --> 00:24:56,998
- I hang out at bathhouses after all.

351
00:24:57,048 --> 00:24:58,794
- Blessed are those who mourn.

352
00:24:58,844 --> 00:25:01,013
- I mourn all right, even in the steam.

353
00:25:01,063 --> 00:25:02,703
- For they will be comforted.

354
00:25:02,753 --> 00:25:06,541
- Because I just don't
feel right about it.

355
00:25:06,591 --> 00:25:07,868
- What about the meek?

356
00:25:07,918 --> 00:25:09,359
Those who serve coffee?

357
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:11,395
- They will inherit the earth, darling.

358
00:25:11,445 --> 00:25:13,620
- I will meekly follow this
man where ever he goes and do

359
00:25:13,644 --> 00:25:16,417
whatever he tells me to do as best I can.

360
00:25:16,467 --> 00:25:18,550
- Hand me my coffee then.

361
00:25:22,196 --> 00:25:24,763
Blessed are those who hunger
and thirst for righteousness

362
00:25:24,813 --> 00:25:26,868
for they will be filled.

363
00:25:26,918 --> 00:25:30,585
- [Nathaniel] Yes, I
am starved and thirsty.

364
00:25:35,439 --> 00:25:37,238
- Blessed are the peacemakers, for they...

365
00:25:37,288 --> 00:25:38,429
- Hold on.

366
00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:40,452
What about the merciful?

367
00:25:40,502 --> 00:25:43,379
- Blessed are the merciful,
for they will be shown mercy.

368
00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:44,899
- And that's where you
give Bart the look like

369
00:25:44,923 --> 00:25:47,590
you're gonna interrupt me again?

370
00:25:49,446 --> 00:25:51,714
If we don't include his words about lust,

371
00:25:51,764 --> 00:25:53,849
we should at least include
the business about anger,

372
00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:55,708
even if you call your
brother a fool, et cetera.

373
00:25:55,732 --> 00:25:59,024
- I tell you that anyone who
is angry with his brother

374
00:25:59,074 --> 00:26:01,341
will be subject to judgment.

375
00:26:01,391 --> 00:26:05,141
Anyone who says to his
brother raca will face

376
00:26:06,655 --> 00:26:10,043
Sanhedrin, but anyone who says you fool,

377
00:26:10,093 --> 00:26:13,261
will be subject to the fire of hell.

378
00:26:13,311 --> 00:26:15,666
- I'm not exactly up on my scripture.

379
00:26:15,716 --> 00:26:16,842
What is raca?

380
00:26:16,892 --> 00:26:19,563
- Oh, worthless, blockhead.

381
00:26:19,613 --> 00:26:20,559
- And Sanhedrin?

382
00:26:20,609 --> 00:26:22,465
- Judges all across Israel.

383
00:26:22,515 --> 00:26:26,182
So we include Matt 5:22,
I added, 5:43, 45...

384
00:26:27,891 --> 00:26:30,258
- Slow down, slow down.

385
00:26:30,308 --> 00:26:31,091
- Matthew?

386
00:26:31,141 --> 00:26:33,871
- Mm-hm, you have heard that
it was said, you shall love

387
00:26:33,921 --> 00:26:35,587
your neighbor and hate your
enemy, but I say to you

388
00:26:35,611 --> 00:26:36,965
love your enemies and pray
for those who persecute you

389
00:26:36,989 --> 00:26:39,105
so you may be sons of your
father who is in heaven.

390
00:26:39,155 --> 00:26:41,051
And here's where I jumped to 5:48.

391
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:42,802
You therefore must be perfect as your

392
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:43,949
heavenly father is perfect.

393
00:26:43,999 --> 00:26:45,304
- Then what do you do?

394
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,104
With the word of God.

395
00:26:48,826 --> 00:26:50,295
- Where to go.

396
00:26:50,345 --> 00:26:53,168
- You go to 5:20, for I tell
you unless you're righteousness

397
00:26:53,218 --> 00:26:55,529
exceeds the righteousness of
the scribes and Pharisees,

398
00:26:55,579 --> 00:26:57,565
you will never enter
the kingdom of heaven.

399
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:58,788
- I was gonna run it by you.

400
00:26:58,838 --> 00:27:01,689
Maybe have one of the
disciples say something like,

401
00:27:01,739 --> 00:27:05,359
"Hey guy, that's absolutely
impossible for anybody to do.

402
00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:07,270
"Who could be more righteous
than the most righteous

403
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:08,187
"people on earth?"

404
00:27:08,237 --> 00:27:10,602
- I like it because
it's exactly the point.

405
00:27:10,652 --> 00:27:12,338
Impossible standards.

406
00:27:12,388 --> 00:27:14,344
That's why they need him.

407
00:27:14,394 --> 00:27:19,195
- Maybe throw in 2 Corinthians,
for our sake he made him

408
00:27:19,245 --> 00:27:21,101
to be sin who knew no sin.

409
00:27:21,151 --> 00:27:24,274
So that in him we may become
the righteousness of God.

410
00:27:24,324 --> 00:27:25,364
- Are we boring you?

411
00:27:25,414 --> 00:27:26,997
- Sorry about that.

412
00:27:28,418 --> 00:27:30,168
- Take five, minions.

413
00:27:34,469 --> 00:27:36,525
- [Female] Anyone who is
angry with his brother

414
00:27:36,575 --> 00:27:38,602
will be subject to judgment.

415
00:27:38,652 --> 00:27:42,819
(dramatic music drowns out speaker)

416
00:27:51,582 --> 00:27:54,774
- Throwing your chi all
over the fucking room.

417
00:27:54,824 --> 00:27:56,741
- Slow down, slow down.

418
00:27:57,596 --> 00:28:01,096
- [Hooker] Just a little itsy-bitsy extra.

419
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:03,890
- Yeah.

420
00:28:06,525 --> 00:28:08,948
- [Venus] You're the one who called.

421
00:28:08,998 --> 00:28:11,581
- Venus, whatever your name is.

422
00:28:14,405 --> 00:28:16,238
Whatever your name is.

423
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,503
- [Lemur] What about my 200?

424
00:28:30,038 --> 00:28:34,205
- [Nathaniel] Girls and
your fucking (mumbles).

425
00:28:35,443 --> 00:28:36,276
- Window.

426
00:28:40,307 --> 00:28:45,218
(mumbles) French for, perfectly
trimmed, sweet smelling,

427
00:28:45,268 --> 00:28:46,101
window.

428
00:28:49,649 --> 00:28:51,816
You stupid son of a bitch.

429
00:29:20,214 --> 00:29:22,631
(chattering)

430
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,485
- I thought I heard someone come in.

431
00:29:33,535 --> 00:29:35,952
(chattering)

432
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:44,181
Nathaniel.

433
00:29:47,277 --> 00:29:49,247
- We hate each other, remember?

434
00:29:49,297 --> 00:29:50,797
- We do, don't we?

435
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:54,794
Your father had a meeting
at (mumbles) anyway.

436
00:29:54,844 --> 00:29:56,813
So he'll meet you at the restaurant.

437
00:29:56,863 --> 00:29:59,617
So he'll meet you at the restaurant.

438
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:01,523
- Why didn't you just call me?

439
00:30:01,573 --> 00:30:05,740
- Well, maybe I just wanted
to meet the lucky girl.

440
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:09,042
- Perfect, let's go.

441
00:30:11,157 --> 00:30:12,657
- You got an hour.

442
00:30:13,804 --> 00:30:15,546
- Excuse him.

443
00:30:15,596 --> 00:30:17,596
Really nice to meet you.

444
00:30:23,001 --> 00:30:25,939
- Would you at least have him call me?

445
00:30:25,989 --> 00:30:28,472
- What the hell was all that about?

446
00:30:28,522 --> 00:30:29,305
Nathaniel?

447
00:30:29,355 --> 00:30:30,621
- What?

448
00:30:30,671 --> 00:30:32,612
- Why am I such a lucky girl?

449
00:30:32,662 --> 00:30:33,579
Be careful.

450
00:30:37,197 --> 00:30:39,098
- Stand fast therefore
in the liberty by which

451
00:30:39,148 --> 00:30:41,288
Christ has set us free.

452
00:30:41,338 --> 00:30:43,661
And do not be entangled again
with the yoke of bondage.

453
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:46,786
- Leviticus 19:13 if a man
lies with another male,

454
00:30:46,836 --> 00:30:49,309
he is creating abomination,
and their death shall be

455
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:50,573
on them alone.

456
00:30:50,623 --> 00:30:51,456
Period!

457
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:58,221
- You want to fuck my guy?

458
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,133
His little brother.

459
00:31:08,899 --> 00:31:11,268
You picked the two wrong
guys to dance with tonight,

460
00:31:11,318 --> 00:31:12,235
didn't you?

461
00:31:21,274 --> 00:31:24,357
They would have killed you, except...

462
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:44,635
Except for what?

463
00:31:51,605 --> 00:31:52,772
Except for me.

464
00:32:55,092 --> 00:32:57,092
- I'm a worm, not a man.

465
00:32:58,603 --> 00:33:01,755
Scorned by men and despised by the people.

466
00:33:01,805 --> 00:33:03,722
All who see me mock me.

467
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:08,312
They hurl insults, shaking their heads.

468
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:09,536
- Ava?

469
00:33:09,586 --> 00:33:12,466
- Roaring lions tearing their prey apart.

470
00:33:12,516 --> 00:33:14,640
Their mouths wide against it.

471
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:15,636
- Don't.

472
00:33:15,686 --> 00:33:17,984
- I am poured out like
water, and all my bones

473
00:33:18,034 --> 00:33:20,203
are out of joint.

474
00:33:20,253 --> 00:33:23,701
(cat screeching)

475
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,918
(gasping)

476
00:33:39,437 --> 00:33:42,117
- Ah swath of breeze feels
good against our unencumbered

477
00:33:42,167 --> 00:33:45,528
genitalia, it is not pungent
or nasty to us in any way

478
00:33:45,578 --> 00:33:46,583
at this point.

479
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:47,633
- Sure does.

480
00:33:48,498 --> 00:33:49,353
How about pick some berries?

481
00:33:49,377 --> 00:33:50,695
- 'Kay, love you.

482
00:33:50,745 --> 00:33:52,078
- Love you, too.

483
00:33:58,198 --> 00:34:02,073
- You must not eat from
any trees in this garden.

484
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:02,956
My ass.

485
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,529
- We may eat from trees in
the garden, just not the tree

486
00:34:06,553 --> 00:34:09,241
in the middle, or touch it.

487
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:11,017
Or else we'll die.

488
00:34:11,067 --> 00:34:12,752
- You will not surely die.

489
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:15,297
For God knows that when you eat of it,

490
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:17,262
your eyes will be opened.

491
00:34:17,312 --> 00:34:21,312
And you will be like God,
knowing good and evil.

492
00:34:23,115 --> 00:34:24,656
- When the woman saw that
the fruit of the tree

493
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,389
was good for food, and
pleasing to the eye and also

494
00:34:27,439 --> 00:34:31,606
desirable for gaining wisdom,
she took some and ate it.

495
00:34:34,334 --> 00:34:37,299
The eyes of both were
opened and they realized

496
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:39,099
that they were naked.

497
00:34:40,193 --> 00:34:42,944
- What on earth is that
Cyclopean serpent dangling

498
00:34:42,994 --> 00:34:45,207
above it's own two eggs?

499
00:34:45,257 --> 00:34:48,007
It's vertical eye and their slit.

500
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:52,448
- What on earth is that
voluptuous slice of vulgarity?

501
00:34:52,498 --> 00:34:54,331
That man eating abyss?

502
00:34:55,597 --> 00:34:58,393
- Who told you that you were naked?

503
00:34:58,443 --> 00:34:59,993
Have you eaten from the
tree I commanded you not

504
00:35:00,017 --> 00:35:01,534
to eat from?

505
00:35:01,584 --> 00:35:03,808
- This bitch, she gave me
some fruit and I ate it.

506
00:35:03,858 --> 00:35:05,488
I didn't know what it was.

507
00:35:05,538 --> 00:35:07,353
- What is this you've done?

508
00:35:07,403 --> 00:35:09,230
- I was deceived, plain and simple.

509
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,116
By a comely entity, and
it did have two horns.

510
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:15,472
- Well, you'll bleed by the
month from what is now a curse

511
00:35:15,522 --> 00:35:18,715
you straddle and I shall
greatly increase your pains

512
00:35:18,765 --> 00:35:20,421
during childbirth.

513
00:35:20,471 --> 00:35:22,514
Your desire will be nothing for yourself,

514
00:35:22,564 --> 00:35:25,700
but everything for the pleasure of man.

515
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,530
And he will rule over you.

516
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,784
- Shit.

517
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:31,941
- And you, oh, you will
be relentlessly in tuned

518
00:35:31,991 --> 00:35:35,282
to this fold of flesh
by which he is cursed.

519
00:35:35,332 --> 00:35:37,403
Able to see her only relative to it.

520
00:35:37,453 --> 00:35:40,177
The fruit hung before her
heart shall be a distraction

521
00:35:40,227 --> 00:35:41,913
as opaque as their milk.

522
00:35:41,963 --> 00:35:44,084
Forever camouflaging it's pulse.

523
00:35:44,134 --> 00:35:46,834
Your intentions will never
be more than the quenchless

524
00:35:46,884 --> 00:35:51,051
aim of the divining rod I
hereby perpetually engorge.

525
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:57,444
The middle of your (mumbles)
forever driven at her loins.

526
00:35:57,494 --> 00:35:58,994
- All right, good.

527
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:02,007
But, actually, nevermind.

528
00:36:05,268 --> 00:36:09,407
- Yeah, yeah, and number two,
I wanna talk to you about

529
00:36:09,457 --> 00:36:12,790
and I want to talk to you about a raise.

530
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:21,183
No.

531
00:36:21,233 --> 00:36:22,612
I don't mean like a boner,
I mean like something you

532
00:36:22,636 --> 00:36:25,317
can slip in your pocketbook.

533
00:36:25,367 --> 00:36:26,491
Yeah, for real...

534
00:36:26,541 --> 00:36:29,454
(doorbell chiming)

535
00:36:29,504 --> 00:36:30,337
Yeah.

536
00:36:32,137 --> 00:36:32,970
I know.

537
00:36:35,948 --> 00:36:36,919
Holy shit.

538
00:36:36,969 --> 00:36:37,758
- Mr. Waite.

539
00:36:37,808 --> 00:36:39,625
- Hey, I'm gonna call ya back baby.

540
00:36:39,675 --> 00:36:40,508
Yeah.

541
00:36:42,092 --> 00:36:43,436
My niece.

542
00:36:43,486 --> 00:36:46,576
- Is Nathaniel, we were gonna take a dip.

543
00:36:46,626 --> 00:36:47,930
- Yeah, come on in then.

544
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,552
- Is he here?

545
00:36:49,602 --> 00:36:51,654
- He's walking the dog with the old lady.

546
00:36:51,704 --> 00:36:53,249
But you can come in.

547
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:54,769
- Are they at the park?

548
00:36:54,819 --> 00:36:57,402
- I don't know where they are.

549
00:36:57,452 --> 00:36:59,688
- I'm just gonna go meet them there.

550
00:36:59,738 --> 00:37:00,571
Thanks.

551
00:37:02,799 --> 00:37:04,132
- Suit yourself.

552
00:37:06,368 --> 00:37:08,962
- It's you judging your father, not me.

553
00:37:09,012 --> 00:37:11,350
And it's you condemning yourself.

554
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,817
Not anybody else.

555
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,587
- Your dad.

556
00:37:22,211 --> 00:37:26,058
All of us has attributes, whether
you say it doesn't or not.

557
00:37:26,108 --> 00:37:29,329
Wouldn't it be great to
just open up no matter what?

558
00:37:29,379 --> 00:37:33,129
You call it on the dance
floor, presumptuous.

559
00:37:33,975 --> 00:37:36,412
That's what I've longed for my whole life.

560
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:37,795
Be presumptuous.

561
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:40,290
To have faith.

562
00:37:46,702 --> 00:37:50,565
You can't not presume,
negation wants as much as my

563
00:37:50,615 --> 00:37:52,910
starry-eyed conjecture.

564
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,880
Isn't that something else
your over amped pompous

565
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:57,618
vocabulary called it on the dance floor?

566
00:37:57,668 --> 00:37:59,251
- High school, Ava.

567
00:38:00,465 --> 00:38:02,567
- But are you anymore open?

568
00:38:02,617 --> 00:38:05,782
- How much intolerance
should tolerance but up with?

569
00:38:05,832 --> 00:38:07,915
- I've been tolerant now?

570
00:38:08,983 --> 00:38:11,598
- It all sounds very nice theoretically.

571
00:38:11,648 --> 00:38:15,065
But by the book it's judgemental as hell.

572
00:38:16,196 --> 00:38:18,294
Look at the text of the play we're in.

573
00:38:18,344 --> 00:38:20,011
As liberal as it is.

574
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:24,093
What do you believe?

575
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:30,009
- The whole nine yards.

576
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:31,809
- You can't possibly.

577
00:38:32,766 --> 00:38:33,933
- Why is that?

578
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:42,837
- [Pastor] We need to get
those flyers out to the

579
00:38:42,861 --> 00:38:44,705
congregation with our need for apostles.

580
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:45,674
- [Female] Will do.

581
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:49,891
- Well, I did not lay with my
life until our wedding night.

582
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:53,228
So I am the greatest.

583
00:38:53,278 --> 00:38:56,227
- I made love to a couple
whores, but I gave each of

584
00:38:56,277 --> 00:38:58,547
them a beautiful pair of sandals.

585
00:38:58,597 --> 00:39:00,517
And I gave one of them my
cloak because her naked

586
00:39:00,544 --> 00:39:02,968
body was getting cold.

587
00:39:03,018 --> 00:39:04,720
Aren't I wonderful?

588
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:08,844
Jesus said that we should
give our cloak also.

589
00:39:08,894 --> 00:39:11,233
- I killed a Roman tax
collector to help the Messiah

590
00:39:11,283 --> 00:39:13,919
release us from the bondage
of this Roman oppression.

591
00:39:13,969 --> 00:39:16,618
- I am a tax collector and
I take offense to that.

592
00:39:16,668 --> 00:39:18,970
I did not cheat anybody
and only took what were

593
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,108
lawful taxes.

594
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:22,396
- Just be thankful that I
did not murder you, too.

595
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:25,269
- Well, I have not had sex
with any human beings at all.

596
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:27,942
I only lay with goats
and sheep, and so I must

597
00:39:27,992 --> 00:39:29,325
be the greatest.

598
00:39:30,341 --> 00:39:34,188
- I saw a one legged whore
and gave her two dollars,

599
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:36,533
as an act of kindness.

600
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:40,750
And, I did not beseech her
rank mouth to suck me off.

601
00:39:42,158 --> 00:39:44,542
- That is no good, you
cannot have rewards in heaven

602
00:39:44,592 --> 00:39:46,601
for that because you just told us.

603
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:50,145
- I am letting my light shine before men.

604
00:39:50,195 --> 00:39:52,319
- When you give or pray
you're supposed to be quiet

605
00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:53,783
about it.

606
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:56,732
- I think Judas Iscariot is the greatest.

607
00:39:56,782 --> 00:39:59,301
He is our master and trusted
him with the money box.

608
00:39:59,351 --> 00:40:01,227
- But he steals from the money box.

609
00:40:01,277 --> 00:40:03,884
- Judge not lest you be judged.

610
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:07,098
- Yeah, we were a bunch
of selfish losers with

611
00:40:07,148 --> 00:40:08,691
self esteem problems.

612
00:40:08,741 --> 00:40:11,353
We thought we were all
in on a good thing to be

613
00:40:11,403 --> 00:40:13,385
hanging out with Jesus
because he was gonna be our

614
00:40:13,435 --> 00:40:15,546
next king on the throne of David.

615
00:40:15,596 --> 00:40:18,151
He was gonna kick the
Romans out of Israel.

616
00:40:18,201 --> 00:40:21,662
We could probably be
his cabinet secretaries.

617
00:40:21,712 --> 00:40:24,332
- Then we got Mother of
Zebedee's sons and all that.

618
00:40:24,382 --> 00:40:26,172
Grant them one of these two sons of mine,

619
00:40:26,222 --> 00:40:28,761
(mumbles) said sure and the
other left, blah blah blah.

620
00:40:28,811 --> 00:40:30,549
Jesus, you know that.

621
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:33,751
- Do you know that the
rulers of the Gentiles lorded

622
00:40:33,801 --> 00:40:34,828
over them?

623
00:40:34,878 --> 00:40:36,213
Not so with you.

624
00:40:36,263 --> 00:40:38,631
Instead, whoever wants
to become great among you

625
00:40:38,681 --> 00:40:41,134
must be your servant and
whoever wants to be first

626
00:40:41,184 --> 00:40:42,768
must be your slave.

627
00:40:42,818 --> 00:40:44,986
Just as the son of man
did not come to be served,

628
00:40:45,036 --> 00:40:48,587
but to serve and to give his
life as a ransom for many.

629
00:40:48,637 --> 00:40:51,744
- If I give my life
for the sake of others,

630
00:40:51,794 --> 00:40:53,861
I am truly great.

631
00:40:53,911 --> 00:40:55,852
- You are the lowest of the lows.

632
00:40:55,902 --> 00:40:58,627
You are a gay bottom,
probably a diseased ass

633
00:40:58,677 --> 00:41:00,331
at a bathhouse.

634
00:41:00,381 --> 00:41:02,553
How can anything good come from you?

635
00:41:02,603 --> 00:41:04,922
- Did you hear about that
queer Crooner, we stoned

636
00:41:04,972 --> 00:41:05,966
to death for that?

637
00:41:06,016 --> 00:41:09,266
May I tally the stoning of this
Kurt, for that was his name.

638
00:41:09,316 --> 00:41:12,122
May the heavens tally it
up to me, the greatest

639
00:41:12,172 --> 00:41:16,462
for having participated
in his torture and death.

640
00:41:16,512 --> 00:41:19,546
- Just be thankful we
are keeping you alive.

641
00:41:19,596 --> 00:41:24,382
If it were not for Jesus, we
would stone you to death too.

642
00:41:24,432 --> 00:41:26,844
- Why does not Jesus fulfill
the law and ask us to

643
00:41:26,894 --> 00:41:29,091
stone you to death, you faggot?

644
00:41:29,141 --> 00:41:29,973
- Scum.

645
00:41:30,023 --> 00:41:30,997
- Get out of here.

646
00:41:31,047 --> 00:41:33,045
We do not want you lusting after us.

647
00:41:33,095 --> 00:41:36,003
- Yeah, we are getting
ready for bed, you faggot.

648
00:41:36,053 --> 00:41:40,220
- As a father who's loved
me, so have I loved you.

649
00:41:41,629 --> 00:41:44,634
If you obey my commands,
you will remain in my love.

650
00:41:44,684 --> 00:41:47,362
Just as I have obeyed my
father's commands and remain

651
00:41:47,412 --> 00:41:48,841
in his love.

652
00:41:48,891 --> 00:41:51,786
I have told you this so
that my joy may be in you.

653
00:41:51,836 --> 00:41:54,669
And that your joy may be complete.

654
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:56,836
- So what did I do?

655
00:41:56,886 --> 00:41:58,759
I've obeyed him.

656
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:00,933
At least I try to obey him.

657
00:42:00,983 --> 00:42:04,249
It's very very hard,
I'm constantly tempted.

658
00:42:04,299 --> 00:42:06,339
Two weeks later I meet a
man at the gym who gives me

659
00:42:06,372 --> 00:42:07,642
a sack of silver.

660
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:10,035
I go to his house thinking
that I will just kiss him

661
00:42:10,085 --> 00:42:12,396
a little bit, and give him a massage.

662
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,029
I failed miserably.

663
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:17,558
He ends up poking me and
afterwards I feel like a runny

664
00:42:17,582 --> 00:42:20,249
egg sandwich, cold and sulfuric.

665
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:24,741
You couldn't tell how serious
it was just by looking

666
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:27,458
at him, but when his kidneys go,

667
00:42:28,915 --> 00:42:31,165
he's not gonna do dialysis.

668
00:42:32,345 --> 00:42:33,678
- You should go.

669
00:42:37,607 --> 00:42:41,170
- There's this play I got roped into.

670
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,791
- You hate it.

671
00:42:42,841 --> 00:42:44,258
- I'm having fun.

672
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,340
- I wish you would have stuck with acting.

673
00:42:51,773 --> 00:42:53,665
- You would have married me.

674
00:42:53,715 --> 00:42:54,798
- Definitely.

675
00:43:10,315 --> 00:43:12,982
Should have brought my own tent.

676
00:43:15,922 --> 00:43:20,164
- It's like my leg is stuck,
I'm just howling for a knife.

677
00:43:20,214 --> 00:43:23,214
- Where do you aim them these howls?

678
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,534
- Pondering this.

679
00:43:27,584 --> 00:43:29,751
Nathaniel was enlightened.

680
00:43:31,197 --> 00:43:35,312
Overlooking the (mumbles)
dirt of his master's work.

681
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:38,351
- You think you are so smart.

682
00:43:38,401 --> 00:43:40,277
- I'm the first to admit how stupid.

683
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:42,098
- Ah, second.

684
00:43:42,148 --> 00:43:44,143
You're trying to change who you are.

685
00:43:44,193 --> 00:43:46,074
And not just because the
world becomes so much simpler

686
00:43:46,098 --> 00:43:48,931
with a woman, but maybe sincerely.

687
00:43:50,994 --> 00:43:54,699
But it's on a different
level that I won't.

688
00:43:54,749 --> 00:43:56,844
My church isn't a farse to me.

689
00:43:56,894 --> 00:43:58,977
It's not a contradiction.

690
00:43:59,925 --> 00:44:03,402
Not peeking out all trembly and diffident.

691
00:44:03,452 --> 00:44:06,685
And that's my sole excuse
for loving something bigger

692
00:44:06,735 --> 00:44:08,533
and better than myself.

693
00:44:08,583 --> 00:44:09,750
Hide and seek?

694
00:44:13,733 --> 00:44:16,698
Whoever lives by the truth
comes into the light.

695
00:44:16,748 --> 00:44:18,904
So if he's seen plainly
that what he has done

696
00:44:18,954 --> 00:44:21,261
has been done through God.

697
00:44:21,311 --> 00:44:22,713
But you don't want to hear that, right?

698
00:44:22,737 --> 00:44:24,349
Not from me.

699
00:44:24,399 --> 00:44:26,682
Because I'm your projection.

700
00:44:26,732 --> 00:44:29,565
The real me spills off the screen.

701
00:44:32,108 --> 00:44:36,637
All this light comes into the
world but men love darkness.

702
00:44:36,687 --> 00:44:37,520
Why?

703
00:44:45,863 --> 00:44:49,696
It's not me who's hiding,
Nathaniel, it's you.

704
00:44:58,009 --> 00:44:59,226
When?

705
00:44:59,276 --> 00:45:00,943
- [Nathaniel] Vegas.

706
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:06,125
- Who do you even know in Vegas?

707
00:45:07,326 --> 00:45:09,993
Did you do what I think you did?

708
00:45:11,536 --> 00:45:15,703
I can't believe it, to prove
it's physically possible?

709
00:45:16,912 --> 00:45:19,150
You're just like you're
willing to exploit her,

710
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,165
some poor fool would
do anything for money.

711
00:45:22,215 --> 00:45:23,786
Some poor prostitute?

712
00:45:23,836 --> 00:45:27,336
- Listen, she was anything but poor, okay?

713
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:31,864
- Just like you're willing to
exploit her, you're willing

714
00:45:31,914 --> 00:45:33,081
to exploit me?

715
00:45:34,092 --> 00:45:36,688
For how I feel about you?

716
00:45:36,738 --> 00:45:38,565
And for what?

717
00:45:38,615 --> 00:45:41,304
A man you don't respect,
who betrays your mother

718
00:45:41,354 --> 00:45:43,884
how many times a week with her?

719
00:45:43,934 --> 00:45:47,184
That secretary thinks we're
getting married, doesn't she?

720
00:45:47,234 --> 00:45:51,317
Because that's what your
father thinks, isn't it?

721
00:45:56,214 --> 00:45:59,152
Do you think you're a sin or something?

722
00:45:59,202 --> 00:46:00,805
Like I can absolve you?

723
00:46:00,855 --> 00:46:04,815
- I don't respond to that word, Ava, sin.

724
00:46:04,865 --> 00:46:05,865
- Well I do.

725
00:46:08,335 --> 00:46:11,428
- And yet you came up here with me.

726
00:46:11,478 --> 00:46:14,530
And now you're lying here next to me.

727
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:16,463
Isn't that just as much a sin,

728
00:46:16,513 --> 00:46:19,013
as the fucking follow through?

729
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,087
- You are a gay man.

730
00:46:45,996 --> 00:46:48,707
- [Man] But I am a whore
despised by the people.

731
00:46:48,757 --> 00:46:49,927
All who see me, mock me.

732
00:46:49,977 --> 00:46:53,227
They hurl insults, shaking their heads.

733
00:46:54,251 --> 00:46:58,334
- He trusts in the Lord,
let the Lord rescue him!

734
00:47:01,699 --> 00:47:06,169
Let him deliver him
since he delights in him.

735
00:47:06,219 --> 00:47:08,687
- Yet, you brought me out
of the womb and made me

736
00:47:08,737 --> 00:47:11,247
trust in you even at my mother's breast.

737
00:47:11,297 --> 00:47:13,352
From birth I was cast upon you.

738
00:47:13,402 --> 00:47:16,209
From my mother's womb
you have been my God.

739
00:47:16,259 --> 00:47:18,131
Do not be far from me.

740
00:47:18,181 --> 00:47:21,943
For trouble is near and
there is no one to help.

741
00:47:21,993 --> 00:47:23,076
- Okay, good.

742
00:47:32,671 --> 00:47:34,921
(laughing)

743
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:38,319
(hollering)

744
00:48:03,501 --> 00:48:06,251
- Look, just go pee in the ocean.

745
00:48:16,915 --> 00:48:17,832
- Let's go.

746
00:48:19,317 --> 00:48:23,317
- Let's just walk right
through them, all right?

747
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:31,375
- You'll get the shit
beat out of you, okay?

748
00:48:53,778 --> 00:48:56,028
(laughing)

749
00:48:59,635 --> 00:49:01,208
- Fucking serious?

750
00:49:01,258 --> 00:49:03,156
You like that?

751
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:05,505
- [Man] Pierce my hands and
my feet, thus display all

752
00:49:05,555 --> 00:49:08,138
I know, people stare and gloat.

753
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:11,308
They divide my garments among them.

754
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:14,608
(speaker trailing off)

755
00:49:35,153 --> 00:49:36,836
- Hey asshole!

756
00:49:36,886 --> 00:49:38,469
- What's with that?

757
00:49:39,361 --> 00:49:41,861
- I can't believe he did that.

758
00:49:43,174 --> 00:49:44,257
- Don't move.

759
00:49:47,011 --> 00:49:47,844
Stop!

760
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,210
Waiter, waiter!

761
00:49:54,548 --> 00:49:57,647
- I'm not trying to be what I'm not.

762
00:49:57,697 --> 00:50:02,294
But I don't want what I am
to be everything either.

763
00:50:02,344 --> 00:50:04,559
- [Nathaniel] We should do something.

764
00:50:04,609 --> 00:50:05,723
- What like it's a birthday?

765
00:50:05,747 --> 00:50:06,892
It's not a birthday.

766
00:50:06,942 --> 00:50:08,769
- But it is an anniversary.

767
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:10,305
- A beating is nothing to celebrate.

768
00:50:10,355 --> 00:50:11,813
- Surviving it is.

769
00:50:11,863 --> 00:50:13,943
- You mean not killing myself?

770
00:50:13,993 --> 00:50:16,177
- That's one way of putting it, yeah.

771
00:50:16,227 --> 00:50:18,652
That's their point, to make
you loathe yourself, right?

772
00:50:18,702 --> 00:50:20,619
- An act of redundance.

773
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:28,557
I asked what the most
important thing is and he said

774
00:50:30,019 --> 00:50:33,926
all sagacious as shit, being
the scintillating shrink

775
00:50:33,976 --> 00:50:37,476
my fagophobic mother says he is, intimacy.

776
00:50:42,014 --> 00:50:45,519
That's an embarrassment, what's left.

777
00:50:45,569 --> 00:50:47,153
- Does this embarrass you?

778
00:50:47,203 --> 00:50:50,236
- The San Fernando Valley does.

779
00:50:50,286 --> 00:50:51,900
- Then why are we still here?

780
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:53,672
- Because over the hills
and fagging away is what

781
00:50:53,696 --> 00:50:54,861
I almost got killed for.

782
00:50:54,911 --> 00:50:57,193
- Look I wouldn't call lying
in my arms, just because

783
00:50:57,243 --> 00:51:00,493
you put the Hollywood Hills in between.

784
00:51:01,712 --> 00:51:02,962
What's changed?

785
00:51:04,878 --> 00:51:08,209
Your idea of West Hollywood
is haunted by what happened.

786
00:51:08,259 --> 00:51:10,598
- The Himalayas wouldn't be
enough between here and there.

787
00:51:10,648 --> 00:51:11,815
What happened.

788
00:51:13,635 --> 00:51:16,771
Or body and soul, maybe
that's what I want a mountain

789
00:51:16,821 --> 00:51:17,738
in between.

790
00:51:23,591 --> 00:51:25,889
I wish she hadn't been there.

791
00:51:25,939 --> 00:51:26,772
- She?

792
00:52:37,753 --> 00:52:40,365
- And all the woe that
moved him so that he'd gave

793
00:52:40,415 --> 00:52:45,213
that bitter cry, the wild
regrets and the bloody sweats

794
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:47,180
none knew so well as I.

795
00:52:48,095 --> 00:52:50,634
For he who lives more lives than one,

796
00:52:50,684 --> 00:52:53,184
more deaths than one must die.

797
00:52:55,462 --> 00:52:59,195
- So who's being fed to the lions tonight?

798
00:52:59,245 --> 00:53:03,412
What fag shudders this very
hour at the roaring crowd?

799
00:53:04,707 --> 00:53:07,274
What foul little Mexican?

800
00:53:07,324 --> 00:53:10,741
What never not suspicious looking Muslim.

801
00:53:14,419 --> 00:53:16,601
- And thus we rust life's chain.

802
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:19,460
Degraded and alone and some in curse

803
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:23,177
and some in weep, and
some may make no moan.

804
00:53:33,347 --> 00:53:35,121
- I won't be able to afford the madness.

805
00:53:35,171 --> 00:53:37,083
- Yes, you will.

806
00:53:37,133 --> 00:53:38,676
- We'll make sure of it.

807
00:53:38,726 --> 00:53:43,268
- And full blown AIDS as
they spectacularly call it.

808
00:53:43,318 --> 00:53:47,137
Oh, like the plumage of
a peacock, we'll in raid

809
00:53:47,187 --> 00:53:51,270
self rapturously across
my fucked up subsistence.

810
00:53:57,195 --> 00:53:59,612
The miasma of my inspiration.

811
00:54:00,698 --> 00:54:01,698
- Of course.

812
00:54:03,028 --> 00:54:04,528
- May I have some?

813
00:54:05,493 --> 00:54:09,295
- And a matter of pailful focus gentlemen.

814
00:54:09,345 --> 00:54:11,345
Matter of being earnest.

815
00:54:12,527 --> 00:54:16,687
The importance of (laughing).

816
00:54:16,737 --> 00:54:18,878
- You can't just take
people's food like that, Mike.

817
00:54:18,928 --> 00:54:19,711
- Mmmm.

818
00:54:19,761 --> 00:54:20,811
Mm-hmm.

819
00:54:20,861 --> 00:54:21,644
- You can't just...

820
00:54:21,694 --> 00:54:23,861
(moaning)

821
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:28,135
It's not right, you can't just...

822
00:54:28,185 --> 00:54:30,518
(chuckling)

823
00:54:37,281 --> 00:54:39,478
- I will declare your name to my brothers.

824
00:54:39,528 --> 00:54:41,849
In the congregation I will praise you.

825
00:54:41,899 --> 00:54:44,952
You who fear the Lord, praise
him, all you descendants

826
00:54:45,002 --> 00:54:47,768
of Jacob, honor him, revere
him all you descendants

827
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:48,651
of Israel.

828
00:54:49,862 --> 00:54:52,914
For he is not despised or
disdained the suffering

829
00:54:52,964 --> 00:54:54,451
of the afflicted woman.

830
00:54:54,501 --> 00:54:56,602
He has not hidden his face
from him but has listened

831
00:54:56,652 --> 00:54:58,479
to his cry for help.

832
00:54:58,529 --> 00:55:00,020
From you comes the demon of my praise

833
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:02,560
in the greatest symbol.

834
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:06,300
Before those who fear you,
will I fulfill my vows.

835
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:08,649
The poor will eat and be satisfied.

836
00:55:08,699 --> 00:55:10,880
They who seek the Lord will praise him.

837
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:12,956
May your heart live forever.

838
00:55:13,006 --> 00:55:14,878
All the ends of the earth will remember

839
00:55:14,928 --> 00:55:16,483
and turn to the Lord.

840
00:55:16,533 --> 00:55:19,296
And all the families of the
nations will bow down before him

841
00:55:19,346 --> 00:55:22,871
for dominion belongs to
the Lord and he rules

842
00:55:22,921 --> 00:55:23,964
over the nations.

843
00:55:24,014 --> 00:55:25,317
- Get ready.

844
00:55:25,367 --> 00:55:28,400
- All the rich of the earth
will feast in worship.

845
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:31,359
All who go down to the dust
will kneel down before him.

846
00:55:31,409 --> 00:55:35,001
Those who cannot keep
themselves alive, posterity will

847
00:55:35,051 --> 00:55:38,345
serve him, future generations
will be told about the Lord.

848
00:55:38,395 --> 00:55:41,246
They will proclaim his righteousness
to a people yet unborn.

849
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:42,879
For he has done it.

850
00:55:45,488 --> 00:55:47,598
- Ready back there?

851
00:55:47,648 --> 00:55:48,815
- Let's do it.

852
00:56:02,683 --> 00:56:04,725
We did not remember those passages written

853
00:56:04,775 --> 00:56:07,399
centuries before the death of Jesus.

854
00:56:07,449 --> 00:56:10,300
We are more than 108
Old Testament prophecies

855
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:12,105
about the first coming.

856
00:56:12,155 --> 00:56:15,006
We did not consider or remember.

857
00:56:15,056 --> 00:56:17,895
Zechariah describing Judas' betrayal.

858
00:56:17,945 --> 00:56:20,028
With 30 pieces of silver.

859
00:56:22,325 --> 00:56:23,158
- Yes.

860
00:56:27,246 --> 00:56:28,079
- Sorry.

861
00:56:40,885 --> 00:56:42,302
- Which is worse?

862
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,145
Pretending I'll suffice?

863
00:56:45,195 --> 00:56:48,302
The denial, or forgiving
everyone and everything

864
00:56:48,352 --> 00:56:49,685
except yourself?

865
00:56:50,912 --> 00:56:52,711
And religion, of course.

866
00:56:52,761 --> 00:56:55,458
You can ridicule how I
make sense of things,

867
00:56:55,508 --> 00:56:57,660
but I'm not gonna not be
friends with someone I love

868
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:59,822
and you know that.

869
00:56:59,872 --> 00:57:01,039
You used that.

870
00:57:02,022 --> 00:57:03,109
I'm not your specimen.

871
00:57:03,159 --> 00:57:04,816
- Would you stop saying that?

872
00:57:04,866 --> 00:57:06,409
- Classic reaction formation.

873
00:57:06,459 --> 00:57:08,428
I produce your anxiety.

874
00:57:08,478 --> 00:57:11,956
Women do, and you
overcompensate to hide it.

875
00:57:12,006 --> 00:57:14,554
- Brush up on your psychology.

876
00:57:14,604 --> 00:57:15,708
A reaction formation isn't...

877
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:17,132
(hand smacking)

878
00:57:17,182 --> 00:57:20,032
- Complicating matters,
I love what you hate.

879
00:57:20,082 --> 00:57:22,236
Everything that holds up
the steeple out there.

880
00:57:22,286 --> 00:57:25,394
- Not buying a dog eared version
of resurrection folklore.

881
00:57:25,444 --> 00:57:26,491
- See?

882
00:57:26,541 --> 00:57:30,331
Stop making fun of what just
might be my very essence.

883
00:57:30,381 --> 00:57:31,879
- Who's making fun?

884
00:57:31,929 --> 00:57:33,527
- You do.

885
00:57:33,577 --> 00:57:35,223
- How about deconstruct?

886
00:57:35,273 --> 00:57:36,853
- Fine, don't.

887
00:57:36,903 --> 00:57:39,486
- Then don't try to convert me.

888
00:57:40,336 --> 00:57:42,669
- With my body or my church?

889
00:57:49,721 --> 00:57:53,221
- I guess we should get back to rehearsal.

890
00:57:59,053 --> 00:58:01,487
- [Lowboy] Don't be dissin'
Jon (mumbles) on my watch.

891
00:58:01,537 --> 00:58:02,684
- Who's dissin' the guy?

892
00:58:02,734 --> 00:58:03,642
Who do I look like?

893
00:58:03,692 --> 00:58:06,670
Pauly fuckin' Kale, I never
dissed the guy once in my life.

894
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,317
I love the guy, I don't know
why you think I'm always

895
00:58:08,341 --> 00:58:09,344
dissin' the guy.

896
00:58:09,394 --> 00:58:12,728
- Say my name, one time, mother fucker.

897
00:58:12,778 --> 00:58:15,703
I never heard you say Lowboy
not one mother fucking time.

898
00:58:15,753 --> 00:58:16,684
- Lowboy.

899
00:58:16,734 --> 00:58:17,765
- That's how you're gonna say it?

900
00:58:17,789 --> 00:58:18,986
- How the hell am I supposed to say it?

901
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:20,027
- Lowboy.

902
00:58:20,077 --> 00:58:20,910
- Lowboy.

903
00:58:21,795 --> 00:58:24,436
What the fuck ever man.

904
00:58:24,486 --> 00:58:27,561
- I, your Lord and teacher
have washed your feet.

905
00:58:27,611 --> 00:58:30,380
You also should wash one another's feet.

906
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:33,092
I have set an example that
you should do as I have done

907
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:35,244
for you, I tell you the truth.

908
00:58:35,294 --> 00:58:37,338
No servant is greater than his master.

909
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:40,952
Nor is a messenger greater
than the one who sent him.

910
00:58:41,002 --> 00:58:42,242
Now that you know these things,

911
00:58:42,278 --> 00:58:45,218
you'll be blessed if you do them.

912
00:58:45,268 --> 00:58:46,998
(cell phone buzzing)

913
00:58:47,048 --> 00:58:49,185
I'm not referring to all of you.

914
00:58:49,235 --> 00:58:51,775
I know those I have chosen.

915
00:58:51,825 --> 00:58:53,666
But this is to fulfill the scripture.

916
00:58:53,716 --> 00:58:57,350
He who shares my bread has
lifted up his heel against it.

917
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,010
I am telling you now before
it happens so that when

918
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:02,984
it does happen, you'll
believe that I am he.

919
00:59:03,034 --> 00:59:04,102
I tell you the truth.

920
00:59:04,152 --> 00:59:08,189
Whoever accepts anyone I
send, accepts me and whoever

921
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:12,160
accepts me, accepts the one who sent me.

922
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:13,622
I tell you the truth.

923
00:59:13,672 --> 00:59:15,516
One of you is going to betray me.

924
00:59:15,566 --> 00:59:19,733
- Simon Peter elbows John,
asking which one he means.

925
00:59:21,235 --> 00:59:23,521
John, Lord, who is it?

926
00:59:23,571 --> 00:59:27,738
- It is the one to whom I
will give this piece of bread.

927
00:59:30,341 --> 00:59:33,174
When I have dipped it in the dish.

928
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:36,378
- Judas takes the bread, (mumbles) enters,

929
00:59:36,428 --> 00:59:37,331
and you say...

930
00:59:37,381 --> 00:59:39,580
- What you are about to do, do quickly.

931
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:41,100
- Judas is off the races.

932
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:42,652
- Now is the son of man glorified

933
00:59:42,702 --> 00:59:45,664
and God is glorified in him.

934
00:59:45,714 --> 00:59:47,214
- Now his kidneys.

935
00:59:48,362 --> 00:59:51,071
Well, you know the thing of
it is, yeah he looks sick.

936
00:59:51,121 --> 00:59:54,087
But basically like you and me.

937
00:59:54,137 --> 00:59:58,280
Not the usual emaciation
associated with fag come-up-ants.

938
00:59:58,330 --> 01:00:00,663
There just hasn't been time.

939
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,048
How's the fur burger?

940
01:00:05,098 --> 01:00:06,488
- I'm coming out there.

941
01:00:06,538 --> 01:00:08,290
- Tell that mixed up
mother fucker that there's

942
01:00:08,314 --> 01:00:12,682
hemorrhoids bigger than
that bitch's (mumbles).

943
01:00:12,732 --> 01:00:14,607
- That Lowboy?

944
01:00:14,657 --> 01:00:16,466
- He never gonna learn
how to quell that little

945
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:18,248
(mumbles) bastard either.

946
01:00:18,298 --> 01:00:19,810
And the white shit at
the tip of your tongue

947
01:00:19,834 --> 01:00:22,084
don't know what to do with.

948
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:25,441
- Upstage my ass with my own material?

949
01:00:25,491 --> 01:00:27,350
- Smack me mother fucker.

950
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,638
- Did he just say what I think he said?

951
01:00:29,688 --> 01:00:31,688
- Your material, my ass.

952
01:00:33,231 --> 01:00:35,097
And think about that shit
next time you downtown

953
01:00:35,121 --> 01:00:37,704
on that little Christian bitch.

954
01:00:39,696 --> 01:00:40,946
- See ya later.

955
01:00:54,792 --> 01:00:57,347
- I'm going there to
prepare a place for you.

956
01:00:57,397 --> 01:00:59,805
If I'm going to prepare a
place for you, I'll come back

957
01:00:59,855 --> 01:01:02,650
and take you with me so
you may be where I am.

958
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,700
You know the way to where I'm going.

959
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:09,932
- What is it?

960
01:01:09,982 --> 01:01:12,732
- Your friend called, that comic.

961
01:01:16,174 --> 01:01:17,007
- Great.

962
01:01:18,702 --> 01:01:22,119
He's not the most circumspect guy I know.

963
01:01:22,994 --> 01:01:25,251
- Is that what a comic should be?

964
01:01:25,301 --> 01:01:28,504
- Mutual friend isn't doing too well.

965
01:01:28,554 --> 01:01:30,387
- That's what he said.

966
01:01:47,642 --> 01:01:50,309
- He shouldn't have called here.

967
01:01:52,323 --> 01:01:53,156
- Why?

968
01:01:58,022 --> 01:02:01,189
He told me more about that fundraiser.

969
01:02:03,799 --> 01:02:05,382
Were you afraid to?

970
01:02:06,558 --> 01:02:08,373
- You sound like Ava.

971
01:02:08,423 --> 01:02:11,855
- She enjoyed the show, didn't she?

972
01:02:11,905 --> 01:02:14,033
- I just didn't think to tell you.

973
01:02:14,083 --> 01:02:16,005
- As a matter of fact you did.

974
01:02:16,055 --> 01:02:20,758
But you said it was a
fundraiser for sick comics.

975
01:02:20,808 --> 01:02:23,308
- He's a sick comic all right.

976
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:30,570
- Then I wonder if you're
ashamed on some level.

977
01:02:32,857 --> 01:02:37,455
- Money is essentially
being raised to rescue them

978
01:02:37,505 --> 01:02:39,475
from red, white and blue religion.

979
01:02:39,525 --> 01:02:42,904
And what's fueled it over there.

980
01:02:42,954 --> 01:02:46,517
Can you accept why the funds are needed?

981
01:02:46,567 --> 01:02:49,472
- Using God as a Trojan
horse isn't my cup of tea

982
01:02:49,522 --> 01:02:52,772
if that's what you're trying to equate.

983
01:02:53,946 --> 01:02:56,684
It's as Orwellian in my book as yours.

984
01:02:56,734 --> 01:03:00,234
Love and acceptance for hate and division.

985
01:03:03,361 --> 01:03:06,611
The ins and outs of my spirituality,
I'm willing to discuss,

986
01:03:06,661 --> 01:03:10,828
Nathaniel, I just want to
one day hear my son possibly

987
01:03:13,305 --> 01:03:15,722
overcome his own worst enemy.

988
01:03:16,901 --> 01:03:19,484
Your friend, Mike, he couldn't.

989
01:03:33,797 --> 01:03:35,681
- Tell your friend,
Lee, that some stranger

990
01:03:35,731 --> 01:03:38,898
is praying for him back in Scottsdale.

991
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:47,542
And learn your lines.

992
01:03:47,592 --> 01:03:51,175
Or we'll crucify you
upside down on Monday.

993
01:04:02,127 --> 01:04:04,544
(chattering)

994
01:04:19,759 --> 01:04:20,592
- Hey.

995
01:04:23,733 --> 01:04:25,418
Come on, let's go see that hydrocodone

996
01:04:25,468 --> 01:04:27,385
drinking mother fucker.

997
01:04:40,924 --> 01:04:42,674
- [Nathaniel] Really?

998
01:04:44,991 --> 01:04:48,226
- Do I have a blow job story for you.

999
01:04:48,276 --> 01:04:50,504
- Don't even start, bitch, all right?

1000
01:04:50,554 --> 01:04:54,721
- Oh, I'm sorry, my freshly
heterosexual Christian man

1001
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:58,333
playing an apostle no less.

1002
01:04:59,456 --> 01:05:02,857
This guy had the cutest little goatee.

1003
01:05:02,907 --> 01:05:03,907
Tickled, ah!

1004
01:05:06,182 --> 01:05:08,879
Just like the lettuce on a pink taco.

1005
01:05:08,929 --> 01:05:10,142
- Like you would fuckin' know.

1006
01:05:10,192 --> 01:05:11,751
Let's talk some Lowboy, where is he?

1007
01:05:11,801 --> 01:05:13,970
I want him at least (mumbles).

1008
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:17,338
- Those fucking oral
transmucosal Fentanyl lollipops

1009
01:05:17,388 --> 01:05:21,586
he gets in TJ, that's
where the fuck Lowboy is.

1010
01:05:21,636 --> 01:05:24,803
Sittin' on his sweet, sweet, back, oh!

1011
01:05:26,844 --> 01:05:29,011
(mumbles)

1012
01:05:35,308 --> 01:05:37,787
- You know what, look
at this guy, Nick Nolte.

1013
01:05:37,837 --> 01:05:39,594
(laughing)

1014
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:40,477
Oh hell.

1015
01:05:42,103 --> 01:05:44,270
(mumbles)

1016
01:05:48,774 --> 01:05:50,161
- [Nathaniel] So what did
you do with your 30 pieces

1017
01:05:50,185 --> 01:05:51,984
of silver, Judas?

1018
01:05:52,034 --> 01:05:55,113
- And that's supposed to mean what?

1019
01:05:55,163 --> 01:05:58,921
Now that you're the expert
on Arcane biblical bullshit?

1020
01:05:58,971 --> 01:06:01,170
- You called the house
phone because you're nosy

1021
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:03,587
and you couldn't resist
the opportunity to show off

1022
01:06:03,637 --> 01:06:04,924
how nosy you fuckin' are.

1023
01:06:04,974 --> 01:06:07,465
- I'm supposed to know the
fucking maze that is your life?

1024
01:06:07,515 --> 01:06:10,028
Every twist and turn, I
am not the bitch of your

1025
01:06:10,078 --> 01:06:11,820
self reproach, bitch, okay?

1026
01:06:11,870 --> 01:06:15,034
Like the details of the
fundraiser and what the fuck

1027
01:06:15,084 --> 01:06:15,888
the money's for.

1028
01:06:15,938 --> 01:06:18,418
That's off limits to your mother.

1029
01:06:18,468 --> 01:06:21,590
- The lines are one thing,
my father is another.

1030
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,243
I'll take the Colosseum over him any...

1031
01:06:23,293 --> 01:06:25,673
- I wasn't talking to your father, was I?

1032
01:06:25,723 --> 01:06:28,972
- [Nathaniel] Mother fucker, please.

1033
01:06:29,022 --> 01:06:31,605
- I dreamt of a flagstone path.

1034
01:06:33,845 --> 01:06:35,512
And tall wild grass.

1035
01:06:37,913 --> 01:06:42,080
Swaying like water 'cause
maybe Tarkovski would see it.

1036
01:06:45,422 --> 01:06:47,839
One cool flat slab at a time.

1037
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:51,516
- Who's Tarkovski?

1038
01:06:51,566 --> 01:06:54,531
- It's the filmmaker, stupid.

1039
01:06:54,581 --> 01:06:57,632
- Okay, fuck the two
of you in like a 1970s

1040
01:06:57,682 --> 01:06:59,932
bathhouse gang bang kinda way.

1041
01:06:59,982 --> 01:07:02,565
Enough with the stupid already.

1042
01:07:04,037 --> 01:07:07,287
- Moans and groans, rising and staying.

1043
01:07:09,783 --> 01:07:11,200
As spooky as fog.

1044
01:07:14,786 --> 01:07:18,795
Brant (coughs) stokers got nothin'

1045
01:07:18,845 --> 01:07:20,428
on this hungry fag.

1046
01:07:22,498 --> 01:07:23,998
I take all comers.

1047
01:07:25,171 --> 01:07:26,504
Forever be mine.

1048
01:07:28,857 --> 01:07:30,524
I'm an infected fag.

1049
01:07:33,607 --> 01:07:35,987
I'm an infected fag, stupid.

1050
01:07:36,037 --> 01:07:38,405
- [Nathaniel] Like a vampire.

1051
01:07:38,455 --> 01:07:42,622
- Okay, you're so frickin'
funny you do the show tonight.

1052
01:07:44,982 --> 01:07:47,593
- [Nathaniel] You know what,
it doesn't even fuckin' matter.

1053
01:07:47,643 --> 01:07:49,344
- Okay, let me ask you something.

1054
01:07:49,394 --> 01:07:52,428
What if, way back in old fucked up day,

1055
01:07:52,478 --> 01:07:55,984
we down in Alabama way,
what if you could fake white

1056
01:07:56,034 --> 01:07:57,617
with just one kiss?

1057
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:01,657
I mean who wants to bring
this shit storm on us anyway?

1058
01:08:01,707 --> 01:08:04,858
Who's willing to suffer
shit, if we don't have to?

1059
01:08:04,908 --> 01:08:07,548
- The star of the play I got roped into.

1060
01:08:07,598 --> 01:08:11,765
- Oh don't get me started,
you transmogrified bent prick.

1061
01:08:14,807 --> 01:08:16,724
- Nathaniel, Nathaniel!

1062
01:08:18,035 --> 01:08:19,702
- [Nathaniel] Ready.

1063
01:08:21,394 --> 01:08:24,424
- God, how dare you take my son.

1064
01:08:24,474 --> 01:08:26,277
My son was good.

1065
01:08:26,327 --> 01:08:28,160
One of the Christians.

1066
01:08:29,427 --> 01:08:32,094
If you're real as this Jesus is,

1067
01:08:34,562 --> 01:08:37,562
bring someone, to tell me about him.

1068
01:08:39,311 --> 01:08:40,394
And why this.

1069
01:08:44,005 --> 01:08:48,172
- Sir, I'm sorry for your loss
and I offer my condolences.

1070
01:08:49,095 --> 01:08:52,260
Have seen any soldiers about?

1071
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:55,977
- This is my son, God
killed him for my sin.

1072
01:08:59,936 --> 01:09:02,133
- I do not believe that, sir.

1073
01:09:02,183 --> 01:09:04,850
- If you knew my sin, you would.

1074
01:09:05,751 --> 01:09:08,773
- God does not punish people in that way.

1075
01:09:08,823 --> 01:09:10,323
- My sin is heavy.

1076
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:13,680
I betrayed my wife with a man.

1077
01:09:31,465 --> 01:09:33,632
(mumbles)

1078
01:09:35,577 --> 01:09:37,632
- The king will compensate
you for your losses, sir.

1079
01:09:37,682 --> 01:09:40,277
He's only interested
in killing Christians.

1080
01:09:40,327 --> 01:09:42,211
- My son was a Christian.

1081
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:44,430
I am a brother to the king.

1082
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,620
- Your honor, we are so sorry, we must go.

1083
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:48,494
We're chasing the one named Bart.

1084
01:09:48,544 --> 01:09:51,131
He is perverting the country
with this new religion.

1085
01:09:51,181 --> 01:09:53,514
Let us go in that direction.

1086
01:09:55,072 --> 01:09:57,322
- Your dead son has to pee.

1087
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,777
(whispering)

1088
01:10:05,728 --> 01:10:08,228
- How can I receive your gift?

1089
01:10:09,097 --> 01:10:13,264
I'm not like Bart, whose glorious
deeds shine like the son.

1090
01:10:15,058 --> 01:10:17,391
I've never known him to sin.

1091
01:10:18,313 --> 01:10:20,412
There are 12 cities in Armenia.

1092
01:10:20,462 --> 01:10:24,764
Filled with people that love
you and love each other.

1093
01:10:24,814 --> 01:10:26,397
All because of him.

1094
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:32,140
My family with the exception
of my brother, the king,

1095
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:36,107
have all changed for the
better because of him.

1096
01:10:39,492 --> 01:10:41,325
How could you love me?

1097
01:10:46,473 --> 01:10:50,640
How could you love, how could
you love a wicked man like me?

1098
01:10:55,858 --> 01:11:00,417
If that's possible, if that
is possible for you to love

1099
01:11:00,467 --> 01:11:03,884
a man like, then please, bring Bart back.

1100
01:11:10,752 --> 01:11:11,919
- Okay, again!

1101
01:11:13,113 --> 01:11:15,209
Let's shave some lines.

1102
01:11:15,259 --> 01:11:16,092
Ava?

1103
01:11:17,323 --> 01:11:18,156
Honey?

1104
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,501
- I went camping with Nathaniel.

1105
01:11:26,551 --> 01:11:27,384
- Oh.

1106
01:11:28,331 --> 01:11:29,317
- Why?

1107
01:11:29,367 --> 01:11:31,589
Soldiers would kill me if I go back.

1108
01:11:31,639 --> 01:11:35,056
However, if it is your will, yes, all we,

1109
01:11:38,384 --> 01:11:40,553
like sheep have gone astray,
we've turned everyone

1110
01:11:40,603 --> 01:11:42,300
into his own way.

1111
01:11:42,350 --> 01:11:45,018
For with certain song, Isaiah.

1112
01:11:45,068 --> 01:11:46,298
Of course.

1113
01:11:46,348 --> 01:11:48,642
(mumbles) for our
transgressions, he was crushed

1114
01:11:48,692 --> 01:11:50,175
for our inequities.

1115
01:11:50,225 --> 01:11:53,779
Upon him was the
chastised (mumbles) peace.

1116
01:11:53,829 --> 01:11:56,977
With his stripes (mumbles).

1117
01:11:57,027 --> 01:11:57,860
So moved.

1118
01:11:59,858 --> 01:12:01,926
- The backseat threw us
apart, like the car was

1119
01:12:01,976 --> 01:12:04,809
tumbling end over end, not parked.

1120
01:12:06,129 --> 01:12:08,311
In high school, I mean.

1121
01:12:08,361 --> 01:12:12,528
And then Vegas, it wasn't,
it wasn't just the booze.

1122
01:12:16,679 --> 01:12:17,929
It's who he is.

1123
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,399
Who he's trying to hide from.

1124
01:12:21,449 --> 01:12:22,782
Behind my skirt.

1125
01:12:23,992 --> 01:12:25,242
All over again.

1126
01:12:26,609 --> 01:12:30,698
And then the trauma of
losing Mike like that.

1127
01:12:30,748 --> 01:12:33,073
I don't know, it sent him backwards.

1128
01:12:33,123 --> 01:12:36,968
Summer between semesters,
it wasn't like this.

1129
01:12:37,018 --> 01:12:39,461
I mean he was out in West Hollywood.

1130
01:12:39,511 --> 01:12:40,511
To everyone.

1131
01:12:42,355 --> 01:12:43,938
Except his parents.

1132
01:12:51,569 --> 01:12:53,569
- What is even most
despised most in our time,

1133
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:56,212
men attaching themselves to men.

1134
01:12:56,262 --> 01:12:59,595
Cannot separate me from the love of God.

1135
01:13:00,955 --> 01:13:03,268
I was celibate for many years.

1136
01:13:03,318 --> 01:13:05,855
With the apostle Paul in
order to give a gift back

1137
01:13:05,905 --> 01:13:10,072
to God for the sacrifice of my (mumbles).

1138
01:13:12,291 --> 01:13:15,339
Jesus said that if you can
remain celibate and unmarried,

1139
01:13:15,389 --> 01:13:17,017
the sake of the kingdom
of God then you should

1140
01:13:17,041 --> 01:13:18,771
remain celibate and unmarried.

1141
01:13:18,821 --> 01:13:20,374
He also said that not
everyone can accept this

1142
01:13:20,398 --> 01:13:22,065
word about celibacy.

1143
01:13:24,724 --> 01:13:27,274
You never know how long
we have on this earth.

1144
01:13:27,324 --> 01:13:29,947
And it is God's only provision for sin,

1145
01:13:29,997 --> 01:13:32,266
whom you receive the Lord.

1146
01:13:32,316 --> 01:13:34,795
It was the will of the
Lord to crush is earned.

1147
01:13:34,845 --> 01:13:38,596
To put him to grief, his
soul's an offering for guilt.

1148
01:13:38,646 --> 01:13:40,771
He bore the sin of many
bearing their inequities

1149
01:13:40,821 --> 01:13:43,701
so as to make many to
be accounted righteous.

1150
01:13:43,751 --> 01:13:46,362
And though he was brought
as a lamb to the slaughter,

1151
01:13:46,412 --> 01:13:49,577
as a sheep before the shears is gone.

1152
01:13:49,627 --> 01:13:51,950
Opening not his mouth as he
was cut off from the land

1153
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,047
of the living (mumbles).

1154
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:59,180
- Lord, I have sinned
against you and I need you.

1155
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:03,811
Open the door of my existence

1156
01:14:03,861 --> 01:14:07,110
and I receive you as
my savior and my Lord.

1157
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:09,102
Please take control of my life.

1158
01:14:09,152 --> 01:14:11,251
Take control of my life
and make me the person

1159
01:14:11,301 --> 01:14:12,718
that I should be.

1160
01:14:19,875 --> 01:14:21,387
I'm not feeling it.

1161
01:14:21,437 --> 01:14:24,307
- After the prayer,
let's have Theofilis ask

1162
01:14:24,357 --> 01:14:28,757
something like, how do I know
I actually have eternal life?

1163
01:14:28,807 --> 01:14:31,974
- Bart references 1 John 5:11, 12, 13.

1164
01:14:34,084 --> 01:14:37,660
This I write to you, who
believe in the name of the son

1165
01:14:37,710 --> 01:14:42,256
of God, and who will know
you have life eternal.

1166
01:14:42,306 --> 01:14:44,029
- Also, while we're on it,
you gave me a note on this

1167
01:14:44,053 --> 01:14:45,510
from the scripture to the Romans.

1168
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,229
The free gift of God is eternal
life through Christ Jesus

1169
01:14:47,253 --> 01:14:48,656
our Lord, blah, blah, blah.

1170
01:14:48,706 --> 01:14:51,358
And just a sec, if you
confess with your mouth that

1171
01:14:51,408 --> 01:14:52,872
Jesus is Lord, and believe
in your heart that God

1172
01:14:52,896 --> 01:14:54,174
raised him up from the dead...

1173
01:14:54,224 --> 01:14:58,403
- Enter (mumbles) and what not.

1174
01:14:58,453 --> 01:15:00,110
- What the hell is this?

1175
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,769
You damn well better not
be doing to my brother

1176
01:15:01,793 --> 01:15:02,964
what I think you're doing.

1177
01:15:03,014 --> 01:15:05,287
- I'm doing what I have
done with thousands of men.

1178
01:15:05,337 --> 01:15:07,363
- We have our own God, you son of a bitch.

1179
01:15:07,413 --> 01:15:10,049
- I'm preparing this man for reality.

1180
01:15:10,099 --> 01:15:11,813
- Listen up, let me tell you a little

1181
01:15:11,863 --> 01:15:13,491
something about reality.

1182
01:15:13,541 --> 01:15:16,961
You put up a sacrifice
right here and right now,

1183
01:15:17,011 --> 01:15:20,277
to Astaroth, the one the only, our God.

1184
01:15:20,327 --> 01:15:23,804
Or start pissing your robe, my brother.

1185
01:15:23,854 --> 01:15:26,348
- I would would rather brand
red hot to my testimony

1186
01:15:26,398 --> 01:15:28,580
upon my bare back.

1187
01:15:28,630 --> 01:15:30,728
- Whip the shit out of him with rods.

1188
01:15:30,778 --> 01:15:34,556
I want him on the cross upside down.

1189
01:15:34,606 --> 01:15:37,555
His big mouth where is balls should be.

1190
01:15:37,605 --> 01:15:40,084
And your blade will be patient.

1191
01:15:40,134 --> 01:15:42,517
Flay him as you would lay with your lover.

1192
01:15:42,567 --> 01:15:46,304
Tenderly, landerously,
and his screams shall reap

1193
01:15:46,354 --> 01:15:49,684
throughout Armenia, the
greater, and the one dozen

1194
01:15:49,734 --> 01:15:53,171
cities he's tried to
pervert with his tongue.

1195
01:15:53,221 --> 01:15:56,953
And I want his head for my mantle piece.

1196
01:15:57,003 --> 01:15:57,836
- Yeah!

1197
01:15:59,105 --> 01:15:59,938
All right.

1198
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:02,493
That's it.

1199
01:16:02,543 --> 01:16:06,710
Monday, tech week, costumes,
sets, the whole nine yards.

1200
01:16:08,366 --> 01:16:09,937
- Pizza didn't arrive?

1201
01:16:09,987 --> 01:16:10,770
- Called it in?

1202
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:11,698
- Like an hour ago.

1203
01:16:11,748 --> 01:16:14,374
- Again with the pizza!

1204
01:16:14,424 --> 01:16:16,609
Off with their gown at once!

1205
01:16:16,659 --> 01:16:17,715
30 lashes!

1206
01:16:17,765 --> 01:16:20,015
(laughing)

1207
01:16:36,267 --> 01:16:38,434
(mumbles)

1208
01:16:41,159 --> 01:16:41,942
- You do?

1209
01:16:41,992 --> 01:16:46,036
- Yeah, makes my hairs stick
down and get all itchy.

1210
01:16:46,086 --> 01:16:49,280
At least that's how I remember it.

1211
01:16:49,330 --> 01:16:51,255
- Is the point winning?

1212
01:16:51,305 --> 01:16:54,457
Were you winning (mumbles) in the closet?

1213
01:16:54,507 --> 01:16:55,840
Is that winning?

1214
01:16:56,924 --> 01:17:00,272
(mumbles) like your blanket.

1215
01:17:00,322 --> 01:17:04,127
And what you did, it's
bright during the day,

1216
01:17:04,177 --> 01:17:06,529
but haunts him at night.

1217
01:17:06,579 --> 01:17:08,859
- [Mike] Who he is, mostly.

1218
01:17:08,909 --> 01:17:12,787
- Like it didn't haunt you, who you are?

1219
01:17:12,837 --> 01:17:16,004
- I didn't write vagina though, did I?

1220
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:20,793
Growing his beard, again,
like in high school.

1221
01:17:22,212 --> 01:17:24,193
- And is the point winning?

1222
01:17:24,243 --> 01:17:27,676
Were you winning, when you
took that cat in the closet?

1223
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:29,143
Was that winning?

1224
01:17:40,842 --> 01:17:44,585
- If we live for decades in
ultimately die of natural

1225
01:17:44,635 --> 01:17:48,802
causes, even then begging
for more everyday suffering.

1226
01:17:54,398 --> 01:17:55,231
It wins.

1227
01:17:56,386 --> 01:17:58,597
It's the only way I know of

1228
01:17:58,647 --> 01:18:01,730
that whatever this is, that it loses.

1229
01:18:12,841 --> 01:18:14,057
Nah.

1230
01:18:14,107 --> 01:18:15,274
- Not so much.

1231
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:19,477
That's how he felt about it, too.

1232
01:18:19,527 --> 01:18:20,898
Shit, here he comes.

1233
01:18:20,948 --> 01:18:22,708
- [Female] God has given us eternal life.

1234
01:18:22,758 --> 01:18:25,164
This life is his son.

1235
01:18:25,214 --> 01:18:27,856
Those who have the son, have eternal life.

1236
01:18:27,906 --> 01:18:32,151
Those who do not have the
son, do not have eternal life.

1237
01:18:32,201 --> 01:18:35,776
- [Nathaniel] It all
sounds very mysterious.

1238
01:18:35,826 --> 01:18:39,658
But by the book, it's judgemental as hell.

1239
01:18:39,708 --> 01:18:42,247
- I'm the resurrection and the life.

1240
01:18:42,297 --> 01:18:45,748
Whoever believes in me will
live, even though he dies.

1241
01:18:45,798 --> 01:18:49,673
And whoever lives and believes
in me, will never die.

1242
01:18:49,723 --> 01:18:52,915
- [Female] This I write to
you, who believe in the name,

1243
01:18:52,965 --> 01:18:57,132
the son of God and who will
know you have life eternal.

1244
01:18:58,112 --> 01:19:00,362
- Sorry about the charcoal.

1245
01:19:02,636 --> 01:19:06,837
- It's a little bit bigger than just that.

1246
01:19:06,887 --> 01:19:11,148
- You were sure pretty
made about it though.

1247
01:19:11,198 --> 01:19:15,784
- If it hadn't rained, it
wouldn't have mattered.

1248
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:19,466
- A human sacrifice over
something so trivial

1249
01:19:19,516 --> 01:19:20,766
makes it worse.

1250
01:19:23,315 --> 01:19:27,786
- I just got home with the
charcoal and put it on the table.

1251
01:19:27,836 --> 01:19:30,086
I was so pissed off at you.

1252
01:19:32,088 --> 01:19:35,171
I just wanted to keep ragging on you.

1253
01:19:36,741 --> 01:19:38,741
But I couldn't find you,

1254
01:19:40,736 --> 01:19:44,153
so I put the steaks on and sat by myself.

1255
01:19:46,451 --> 01:19:50,183
The clouds started rolling
in, and I was still at that

1256
01:19:50,233 --> 01:19:51,900
table all by myself.

1257
01:19:59,810 --> 01:20:02,060
I even ate your cold steak.

1258
01:20:10,048 --> 01:20:14,331
Then it started raining
like the day before.

1259
01:20:14,381 --> 01:20:16,048
Cats, rats and dogs.

1260
01:20:24,471 --> 01:20:27,436
I had to put the cover on the barbecue.

1261
01:20:27,486 --> 01:20:31,317
It's the only reason
why I went back inside.

1262
01:20:31,367 --> 01:20:32,950
Inside that closet.

1263
01:20:34,967 --> 01:20:36,050
For a jacket.

1264
01:20:38,977 --> 01:20:43,144
- Probably myself back up
the asshole pushed me out.

1265
01:20:45,447 --> 01:20:49,114
And our fight over the
charcoal getting wet.

1266
01:20:50,156 --> 01:20:53,064
- Love the Lord your God
with all of your heart,

1267
01:20:53,114 --> 01:20:56,614
and all of your soul and all of your mind.

1268
01:20:58,019 --> 01:21:01,602
This is the first and
greatest commandment.

1269
01:21:29,044 --> 01:21:29,877
- Help me.

1270
01:21:31,374 --> 01:21:32,777
- Sorry?

1271
01:21:32,827 --> 01:21:34,160
- How's the bag?

1272
01:21:35,826 --> 01:21:39,746
- Honestly, it's not looking
good, you're not peeing

1273
01:21:39,796 --> 01:21:40,879
worth a damn.

1274
01:21:48,654 --> 01:21:52,821
- Open the door, at the
blazing son of God arise up.

1275
01:21:55,384 --> 01:21:59,134
My light has illuminating
fire and set aglow.

1276
01:22:02,966 --> 01:22:07,049
These last drops of what
has been a bitter lemon.

1277
01:22:10,475 --> 01:22:13,975
Make upon a furrow brow, these last hours,

1278
01:22:14,925 --> 01:22:16,008
a sweet heat.

1279
01:22:20,373 --> 01:22:23,206
A perspiration of perpetual peace.

1280
01:22:33,087 --> 01:22:37,617
Venus, making your lust
less harmful to your soul.

1281
01:22:37,667 --> 01:22:39,141
- Yeah, you're gonna want those.

1282
01:22:39,191 --> 01:22:40,803
- And you think likewise.

1283
01:22:40,853 --> 01:22:41,686
- What?

1284
01:22:43,384 --> 01:22:46,051
- A father betraying his family.

1285
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:52,311
More sinful than a mother
not holding him accountable.

1286
01:22:52,361 --> 01:22:53,802
- What did you just say?

1287
01:22:53,852 --> 01:22:57,569
- A man choking his
wife in the neon jungle.

1288
01:22:57,619 --> 01:23:01,786
More sinful than a man using
Ava for his own purposes.

1289
01:23:03,777 --> 01:23:04,610
- Stop.

1290
01:23:06,185 --> 01:23:08,768
- Her body's a steep challenge.

1291
01:23:09,639 --> 01:23:13,056
Your love not exactly a fucking ski lift.

1292
01:23:17,306 --> 01:23:21,056
If she were stark naked
before you, what sin?

1293
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:25,207
Perform a question mark.

1294
01:23:26,818 --> 01:23:27,651
What more?

1295
01:23:30,659 --> 01:23:33,994
Your gape would be as
lustless as a child before

1296
01:23:34,044 --> 01:23:36,961
it's own wet origins in the shower.

1297
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:43,194
- Not the best analogy
given that his orientation

1298
01:23:43,244 --> 01:23:47,411
is an inoculation against a
virulent strain of Oedipus.

1299
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:50,262
- Queers are queers
because they don't want to

1300
01:23:50,286 --> 01:23:52,566
accidentally fuck their mothers?

1301
01:23:52,616 --> 01:23:53,905
Shit.

1302
01:23:53,955 --> 01:23:55,738
- You did fuck your mother.

1303
01:23:55,788 --> 01:23:58,541
- Chew up and swallow my
balls, skid mark, water park,

1304
01:23:58,591 --> 01:24:00,571
basement sand paper soft ass white...

1305
01:24:00,621 --> 01:24:03,987
- What do you have when
you take away the genes?

1306
01:24:04,037 --> 01:24:06,591
- Snail without antlers?

1307
01:24:06,641 --> 01:24:08,480
Peeking out under the hood.

1308
01:24:08,530 --> 01:24:09,931
- [Comic] Take away the genes.

1309
01:24:09,981 --> 01:24:13,564
- Strands of nucleic
acid without identity.

1310
01:24:15,385 --> 01:24:17,552
- [Comic] A curious notch.

1311
01:24:22,952 --> 01:24:23,785
- Look.

1312
01:24:27,263 --> 01:24:29,517
- Put that mother
fuckin' thing away, girl.

1313
01:24:29,567 --> 01:24:30,400
- Look.

1314
01:24:31,843 --> 01:24:34,438
- I'm on my death bed here guys.

1315
01:24:34,488 --> 01:24:36,580
If you're gonna play doctor...

1316
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:37,713
- [Ava] Look!

1317
01:25:26,213 --> 01:25:30,380
- Let's put this fucker
on wheels, what do ya say?

1318
01:25:33,336 --> 01:25:34,919
- Would it be okay?

1319
01:25:36,111 --> 01:25:38,093
- It will be beautiful.

1320
01:25:38,143 --> 01:25:38,976
- Ready?

1321
01:25:46,989 --> 01:25:47,822
Okay.

1322
01:26:01,238 --> 01:26:04,238
(tea pot squealing)

1323
01:27:16,484 --> 01:27:18,984
(eerie music)
