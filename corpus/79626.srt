1
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:40,401
Long ago, when I was a young man,
my father said to me...

2
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:43,169
"Norman, you like to write stories."

3
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:45,471
And I said, "Yes, I do."

4
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,739
Then he said,
"Someday, when you're ready...

5
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,682
you might tell our family story.

6
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:57,416
Only then will you understand
what happened and why."

7
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:19,036
In our family, there was no clear line
between religion and fly-fishing.

8
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:31,121
We lived at the junction of great
trout rivers in Missoula, Montana...

9
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,385
where Indians still appeared
out of the wilderness...

10
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:36,324
to walk the honky-tonks and brothels
of Front Street.

11
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,721
My father was
a Presbyterian minister...

12
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,797
and a fly-fisherman.

13
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:26,372
Though it is true that one day a week
was given over wholly to religion...

14
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:30,670
even then he told us about
Christ's disciples being fishermen.

15
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:34,645
And we were left to assume,
as my younger brother Paul and I did...

16
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:39,081
that all first-class fishermen on the
Sea of Galilee were fly-fishermen...

17
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:42,951
and that John, the favorite,
was a dry fly-fisherman.

18
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:47,652
The poor without Christ
are of all men the most miserable.

19
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,490
But the poor with Christ...

20
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:55,123
are princes and kings
of the earth.

21
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,436
In the afternoon,
we would walk with him...

22
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:01,371
while he unwound
between services.

23
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:04,602
He almost always chose a path
along the Big Blackfoot...

24
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,339
which we considered our family river.

25
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:12,009
It was there he felt his soul restored
and his imagination stirred.

26
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:16,650
Long ago rain fell on mud
and became rock.

27
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,224
Halt a billion years ago.

28
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,962
But even before that,
beneath the rocks...

29
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,033
are the words of God.

30
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,226
Listen.

31
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,645
And if Paul and I listened
very carefully all our lives...

32
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,414
we might hear those words.

33
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:53,184
Even so, Paul and I received as many
hours of instruction in fly-fishing...

34
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,726
as we did
in all other spiritual matters.

35
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,160
As a Presbyterian,
my father believed...

36
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:03,292
that man, by nature,
was a damn mess...

37
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,769
and that only by picking up
God's rhythms...

38
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,136
were we able to regain
power and beauty.

39
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:15,242
To him, all good things, trout as well
as eternal salvation, come by grace.

40
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:19,580
And grace comes by art,
and art does not come easy.

41
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,586
Norman.

42
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:30,291
So my brother and I learned to cast
Presbyterian style:

43
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,796
on a metronome.

44
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:38,701
He began each session
with the same instruction:

45
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,774
Casting is an art that is performed
on a four-count rhythm...

46
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:44,934
between 10:00 and 2:00.

47
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,949
If he had had his way, nobody
who did not know how to catch a fish...

48
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:54,645
would be allowed to disgrace a fish
by catching it.

49
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:06,526
So it was with my formal education
as well.

50
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:10,193
Each weekday, while my father worked
on his Sunday sermon...

51
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,863
I attended the school
of the Reverend Maclean.

52
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:19,008
He taught nothing but reading
and writing. And being a Scot...

53
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,672
believed that the art of writing
lay in thrift.

54
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,850
Half as long.

55
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,661
So while my friends spent their days
at Missoula Elementary...

56
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:48,263
I stayed home and learned to write
the American language.

57
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,852
Again, halt as long.

58
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,610
Good.
Now throw it away.

59
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,832
Norman! Norman!

60
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,995
Wait for your brother!

61
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,942
However, there was a balance
to my father's system.

62
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,714
Every afternoon
I was set free...

63
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,812
untutored and untouched
till supper...

64
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:14,450
to learn on my own
the natural side of God's order.

65
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,735
And there could be no better place
to learn than the Montana of my youth.

66
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:33,207
It was a world
with dew still on it...

67
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:38,783
more touched by wonder and possibility
than any I have since known.

68
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,081
Goddamn it,
open up the door!

69
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,288
What the hell is goin' on?

70
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:23,554
- Where are you guys going?
- Chickens!

71
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,507
Move out of the way.
Get.

72
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:06,237
But it was a tough world, too.
Even as children...

73
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,137
we understood that
and admired it.

74
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,741
And of course,
we had to test it.

75
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,214
I knew I was tough because
I had been bloodied in battle.

76
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,116
Get him!

77
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:25,588
Don't be a sissy!
Come on!

78
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:28,023
Yeah, come on.
Let's see some blood here.

79
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,065
Paul was different.

80
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,363
His toughness came
from some secret place inside of him.

81
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,268
He simply knew he was tougher
than anyone alive.

82
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:45,308
Grace will not be said
until that bowl is clean.

83
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:03,419
Man has been eating God's oats
for a thousand years.

84
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:07,692
It's not the place of an 8-year-old boy
to change that tradition.

85
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,462
Grace.

86
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,935
Oh, God...

87
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,705
rich in forgiveness,
grant that we...

88
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:30,646
may hold fast the good things
we receive from Thee.

89
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,686
And as often as we tall into sin, be
lifted by repentance through Thy grace.

90
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,186
Amen.

91
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:42,316
Norm, what do you want to be
when you grow up?

92
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:45,562
A minister, I guess.

93
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,433
Or a professional boxer.

94
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,197
You think you could beat
Jack Johnson?

95
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:59,374
I think you could.
I'd bet on it.

96
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:04,947
- What are you gonna be?
- A professional fly-fisherman.

97
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,679
- There's no such thing.
- There isn't?

98
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:20,491
I guess a boxer.

99
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,694
Not a minister?

100
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:37,212
In 1917, World War I
came to Missoula...

101
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,911
taking with it
every able-bodied lumberjack...

102
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,989
leaving the woods
to old men and boys.

103
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,291
So at 16, I did my duty...

104
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,987
and started working
for the U.S. Forest Service.

105
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,868
It was a life of timber and toil...

106
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,164
with men as tough
as their ax handles...

107
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:03,204
and more mountains
in all directions...

108
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,800
than I would ever see again.

109
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,613
Being too young to join me...

110
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,845
Paul took a job as lifeguard
at the municipal swimming pool...

111
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,420
so that during the day
he could look over the girls...

112
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,924
and in the evenings he could pursue
his other purpose in life: fishing.

113
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,188
Be Thou my vision

114
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:27,663
O Lord of my heart

115
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:31,167
Naught be all else to me

116
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:35,070
Save that Thou art

117
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:38,166
Thou might press on

118
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:43,340
By day or by night

119
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:46,680
Waking or sleeping

120
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:51,154
Thy presence my light

121
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,792
Preacher, come on.

122
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,867
Preacher, come on.

123
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,401
Shut up!

124
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:58,456
Have I told you what a fire sounds like
coming down a mountain 6o miles an hour?

125
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,923
Him and his forest fires.

126
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,392
I've got a great idea.

127
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,055
- I know how we can go down in history.
- How?

128
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:10,100
We borrow old man Seitert's rowboat
and we shoot the chutes.

129
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:13,228
- You can't shoot the chutes.
- You can try.

130
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:17,002
- You can die trying.
- They'd bury us with honors. Tell him.

131
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,269
- We would be the kings of Missoula.
- We'd be famous.

132
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:25,839
All of you would get your photographs
in the paper.

133
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,886
I'm doing it. I am.

134
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,548
You'll die. No.

135
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:36,986
- Let's do it. Come on.
- I'm with you.

136
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,535
All right.

137
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,506
Let's go!

138
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,745
I'll get the oars.

139
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,876
Whose idea was this?

140
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,546
- Which way we goin', Pauly?
- This way.

141
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,290
I need a woman!

142
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,051
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

143
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,514
Okay, we'll put in upstream.

144
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,699
Flip it.

145
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,374
Okay, hop in.

146
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,414
Come on.
We can all tit.

147
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:07,041
I don't think so.

148
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,458
All right.
Just me, Norm and Chub.

149
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,629
Geez, Pauly.

150
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,469
I guess it's just the Macleans.

151
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,192
Be careful!

152
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,135
You ain't goin' over, Pauly.

153
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,714
- They'll pull to shore.
- See you in heaven!

154
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:13,080
Come back a second.
I gotta tell you something.

155
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,233
See you later, boys!

156
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,975
Rudder on the right.

157
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,176
On your right.
Watch your right.

158
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:17,506
- Steer around.
- Right!

159
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,479
Watch it!
On your right.

160
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,736
Hang on!

161
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:02,925
Oh, geez.

162
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,032
Maclean!

163
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,573
Pauly!

164
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,117
Hey, Chub.

165
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:49,072
What the hell!

166
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,481
You crazy son of a bitch!

167
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,454
- You guys okay?
- Where's--

168
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,259
Preach, you okay?

169
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,535
Sure.

170
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:43,522
You will go to church this day
and pray for forgiveness.

171
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:51,625
Your mother spent the night sick with
worry. Did you think of her feelings?

172
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:54,035
Mrs. Campbell called.

173
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:01,238
- Who gave you the boat?
- We borrowed it.

174
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,146
Borrowed?

175
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,920
Boys, what have you done?

176
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,656
You will work off
every cent of its value.

177
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,697
Yes, sir.

178
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,235
I'll work it oft.
It was my idea.

179
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,017
What're you making?

180
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:48,684
Know what you need?
Ham, cheese and sardines. Delicious.

181
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,261
- I don't want sardines.
- I'll show you.

182
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:55,526
Those guys will tell everyone
the class of '19 did it.

183
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,968
I should write an article.

184
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,039
- "Macleans conquer chutes."
- I don't like sardines.

185
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,540
You could get it in the school paper.

186
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,776
Chub!

187
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:09,210
"Geez, Pauly!"

188
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:13,182
- What a skeezicks!
- I don't want any goddamn sardines!

189
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:41,910
No! Stop it! Stop it!

190
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,046
You hit her,
you son of a bitch!

191
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,417
You knocked her down,
you bastard!

192
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:54,151
- Son of a bitch!
- Please, I slipped!

193
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,663
I just slipped.
That's all.

194
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:25,989
That was the only time...

195
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,082
we ever fought.

196
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:31,684
Perhaps we wondered afterwards
which one of us was tougher.

197
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:35,459
But if boyhood questions aren't answered
before a certain point...

198
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,592
they can't be raised again.

199
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,296
So we returned to being gracious
to one another...

200
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:42,464
as the church wall suggested.

201
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:22,976
I then saw something remarkable.

202
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:28,749
For the first time, Paul broke free
of our father's instruction...

203
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:31,754
into a rhythm all his own.

204
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,821
They're both marvelous.

205
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,301
I'd say the Lord
has blessed us all today.

206
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:30,110
It's just that He's been
particularly good to me.

207
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:43,722
The year ended with my acceptance
into Dartmouth College.

208
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:48,697
Father had told me I could attend any
college in the world I could get into.

209
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:52,430
I knew he earned no more
than $1,800 a year...

210
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:55,802
so his offer meant more to me
than anything in my life.

211
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:58,102
Do your best.

212
00:27:58,209 --> 00:27:59,699
I will.

213
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,911
All aboard!

214
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,924
Norman!

215
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:41,676
So in the autumn of 1919
I boarded the Northern Pacific...

216
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:45,381
for a 3,000-mile trip east
to the unknown.

217
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:53,958
To the son of a Montana minister,
Dartmouth was more than an education.

218
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:58,729
It was a revelation, exposing me
to a world I'd only guessed at.

219
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,309
As part of my degree, I was required
to enlighten incoming freshman...

220
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,577
on the wonders
of the Romantic poets.

221
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:14,879
And although I was unaware
of it then...

222
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:17,250
teaching fit me.

223
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:20,552
But most of the time I sat in
the card room of my fraternity house...

224
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:23,991
giving my bluenose brothers a lesson
in Front Street poker.

225
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:29,232
In all, I spent six years
at Dartmouth...

226
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,666
away from home nearly all that time.

227
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,133
On the other hand,
Paul stayed home for college...

228
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:40,336
unwilling to leave the fish
he had not yet caught.

229
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:49,386
After graduation, he took a job
as a reporter for a Helena newspaper...

230
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:52,422
and moved to that town...

231
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:55,823
his connection with the family
growing as slight as my own.

232
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,734
It was not until the spring
of 1926...

233
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:10,330
that I finally did come home.

234
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,851
Dinner is in half an hour,
so you have time for a bath.

235
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:01,853
Do I look thin?

236
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,621
Do I look old?

237
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,868
No, you look--

238
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:17,738
I wish Paul could've been here tonight.
He's working late.

239
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,713
Norman, would you come in?

240
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:34,184
I'm sorry Paul won't be here.

241
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:36,953
The life of a newspaperman.

242
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:41,061
You know how Paul likes to--

243
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:42,860
I do.

244
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,730
Sit.

245
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:53,075
I also hear that he--

246
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:59,582
I hear everything, don't l? God forbid
my flock keep me in ignorance.

247
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:05,919
Yes.

248
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:10,222
You can bet everyone from here to Helena
knows the details of your education.

249
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:14,092
It is an achievement.

250
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:16,860
To what use shall you put
this achievement?

251
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:26,466
- I'm considering the Forest Service.
- As a career?

252
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,682
No. For the summer.

253
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,786
As a break.

254
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:41,154
That's a good idea.
The body fuels the mind.

255
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,283
- That's what I was thinking.
- And after?

256
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:47,063
I'm not sure yet.

257
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:52,300
You've had six years
to become sure.

258
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,244
Have you considered
an advanced degree?

259
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:08,712
The law? Medicine?

260
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,387
The ministry?

261
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,219
I've applied
for several teaching positions.

262
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:20,695
- Have you?
- College level. I haven't heard yet.

263
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:22,561
No, it's early.

264
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,096
You have taught classes already,
haven't you?

265
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,105
Yes.

266
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,971
Did you find that rewarding?

267
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:36,979
That is to say, do you feel
this could be your calling?

268
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:39,381
My calling?

269
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:43,516
Dinner, gentlemen.

270
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:04,065
If it's so tunny, how come I'm
not laughing? Yes, pee in their pants.

271
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:08,070
- Paul Maclean?
- In there.

272
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,272
The Anaconda Mine rules
say no breaks...

273
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:13,839
not even for the john, so they
stand there and pee in their pants.

274
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,078
- What about the late--
- George Masterson.

275
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:19,714
I'll take that widow.
She's 23 and built like--

276
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:23,055
- You take the Anaconda.
- I'll interview the grieving widow.

277
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:26,129
But I'm the boss, Maclean.

278
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:30,162
Fine by me, boss.
Brother!

279
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,428
Look at you.

280
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:39,766
Boys, this is my big brother,
the professor.

281
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:41,276
Gentlemen.

282
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:45,881
Sit.

283
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,950
- Thanks for visiting me last night.
- Yeah, damn.

284
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:52,318
I am sorry.
Wanted to be there.

285
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:57,124
Wanted to hear the old man say, "Norman,
could you come into my study, please?"

286
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,928
Geez, the professor.

287
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:12,075
We should celebrate.

288
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:23,720
A little early for me.

289
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:28,589
The East is making you soft.

290
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,360
Is that right?

291
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:49,745
Do much fishing out east?

292
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:52,538
None.

293
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,413
None?

294
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:57,386
What do you say?
Big Blacktoot.

295
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:26,675
- You set?
- Yeah.

296
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:37,383
- Take this hole. It's a good one.
- That's all right. You go ahead.

297
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,826
It's a good hole.

298
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,445
Too tight.
Try a roll cast.

299
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:23,271
The fish are out further.

300
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,342
Just a little further.

301
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:32,876
Cast your line into the current. It'll
give a better base and add distance.

302
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:35,680
You're just rusty.
That's all.

303
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,139
He called it shadow casting...

304
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:40,733
keeping his line above water
long enough and low enough...

305
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:43,507
to make a rainbow rise.

306
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:48,012
And I realized
that in the time I was away...

307
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:52,317
my brother had become an artist.

308
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:55,722
My coach comes up to me and says,
"Mac, how'd you like to meet...

309
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,294
John L. Sullivan?"

310
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:02,560
The John L. Sullivan, the last
bare-knuckle champion of the world.

311
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:05,658
It was then I knew I was home.

312
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:09,228
Standing on the steps
of the Missoula Library once again...

313
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,605
late at night, telling stories
to the same boys...

314
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:16,237
who had sat on those steps
and listened a hundred times before.

315
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:20,882
And who had, in my absence,
become men.

316
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:24,421
It goes to show
the world is full of bastards...

317
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:29,050
the number increasing rapidly the
further one gets from Missoula, Montana!

318
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:30,592
Amen!

319
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:33,720
That's why you need to stick
around here from now on.

320
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,695
Where's the gargle?

321
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,234
Yes, pass this way.

322
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:43,204
Every girl you need to know
will be at the 4th of July dance...

323
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:44,797
without mama.

324
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,844
Find you a little Sheba.

325
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:52,509
Gentlemen, it's been swell.

326
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,343
Where're you going?

327
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,217
Heavy date, Paul?

328
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:01,257
- With a poker table.
- You see them new signs?

329
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:06,059
"Does your husband misbehave?
Grunt and grumble, rant and rave?

330
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:09,189
Shoot that brute
some Burma Shave!"

331
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:15,002
- The road to where?
- Lolo.

332
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:17,005
Lolo Hot Springs.

333
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:30,919
Being back in my father's church
seemed to complete my return.

334
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:34,115
More than anything else,
I realized it was my father's words...

335
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:36,159
that made me feel most at home.

336
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,194
In the glow of awakened memories...

337
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:42,425
when the deepest feelings of the heart
are all astir...

338
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:48,094
we are reminded of the poet
who sings...

339
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:51,902
"Backward, turn backward,
O time in your flight.

340
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:54,739
Make me a child again...

341
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,336
just for tonight."

342
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,955
Recognize anybody?

343
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:44,890
You've been gone too long, son.

344
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:51,731
- Who's that?
- Who?

345
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:53,496
There.

346
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,732
Oh, yeah?

347
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:02,837
A little infatuation?

348
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:04,881
Who is that?

349
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:07,248
Jessie Burns.

350
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:11,344
From Wolf Creek.
Her brother went to Hollywood.

351
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:13,252
Jessie Burns.

352
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:24,133
Would you like to dance?

353
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,567
Would you be a doll
and get us a drink?

354
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:29,662
Jessie, who's that?

355
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:00,796
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

356
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:02,838
You're a lifesaver.

357
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:06,273
How ladylike!

358
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:12,415
I have to be careful or
I'll wipe off all the powder.

359
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:15,917
Phantom of the Opera.

360
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:26,662
Pack up all my care and woe

361
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:28,732
Here I go, singing low

362
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:32,666
Bye-bye, blackbird

363
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:37,437
I heard Louis Armstrong
sing this song once...

364
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:40,032
in a little speak
in Greenwich Village, New York.

365
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:42,442
Really?

366
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:45,037
Best jazz in the world.
Colored jazz, you know?

367
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:50,587
The real McCoy. Not like Paul Whiteman
or the Kliquot Club Eskimos.

368
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,816
My mother loves
the Kliquot Club Eskimos.

369
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:57,792
Does she?

370
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:17,511
Dance?

371
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,112
Yeah.

372
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:26,884
Let the fireworks begin!

373
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:32,392
- Guys, come on.
- Jessie, come on.

374
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:47,433
I have a wonderful idea.

375
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:51,378
What better lesson for those girls
than a trip to the reservation...

376
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:56,215
to learn a real Christian message
of giving, don't you think?

377
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,481
I'll organize it.
Don't lift a finger.

378
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:03,526
Thank you. This is the most
charitable idea I've heard in years.

379
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:10,366
Do you know those Indian children don't
even have shoes? Do you need the phone?

380
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:14,767
- No, I don't have to.
- No, you go ahead.

381
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:17,841
- If you need to use it--
- No, I have work to do.

382
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,688
Hello, Mrs. Hatcher.

383
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,958
Hello. I'd like--

384
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:42,361
She's fine. I'd like--

385
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,867
Yes, everybody's tine.

386
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:48,972
I'd like the Burns residence
in Wolt Creek, please.

387
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:55,011
Yes, I know it's long distance.

388
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:56,477
Thank you.

389
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:01,182
Hello.

390
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:03,919
Is Jessie there?

391
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:07,987
This is Norman Maclean,
but I don't think she--

392
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,394
Hello.

393
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:20,429
No, I'm the one
who brought you the drink.

394
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:27,243
No, we didn't get a chance.
The tireworks started.

395
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:31,847
We talked about music.

396
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:39,381
And I said I heard
Louis Armstrong sing the--

397
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,426
Yeah, that's me.

398
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:46,922
I was a little nervous.

399
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:48,793
Because...

400
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:52,800
you were so je ne sais quoi.

401
00:47:57,674 --> 00:48:02,805
I thought I could come and listen to the
Kliquot Club Eskimos with your mother.

402
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,447
Yes.

403
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,483
I called because I wanted
to see you again.

404
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:20,057
How about Saturday?

405
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:23,431
8:00?

406
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:34,868
I'll see you then.

407
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:37,211
Bye.

408
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:57,399
Hey, here they are.

409
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:01,869
Brother!

410
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,736
Jessie, this is my baby brother Paul.

411
00:49:07,844 --> 00:49:11,871
- And this is Monasita.
- Mabel.

412
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:16,179
Shall we?

413
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:24,720
- What do you say, Pauly?
- Murph.

414
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:28,159
- Preacher.
- Preacher?

415
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:31,359
- How are you, Murph?
- Long time. Long time.

416
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,459
Good to see you.

417
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:38,933
You know the house rules
as good as I do, Paul.

418
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:41,806
No lnjuns. Period.

419
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:45,109
I don't like the house rules, Murph.

420
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,046
Me neither.

421
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,622
What are you going
to make me do, Pauly?

422
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:56,750
Get us a table for four.

423
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:09,672
- Last time, Paul.
- Hello, Judge.

424
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,735
You can get him back.
Get drunk and dance naked on the table.

425
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,370
And beat the hell
out of the son of a bitch.

426
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:26,148
- Molly, my darling.
- Hi, Paul.

427
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:33,494
They've got swell hooch here.
They even wash the glasses.

428
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,346
Drink?

429
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:52,711
What'll it be? Jessie? Jessie.

430
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:55,842
I'll have a martini, Paul.
It is Paul?

431
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:02,454
Righty-o. The usual for Norm.
Gin and prune juice.

432
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:04,856
Make that a double.

433
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:06,724
Excuse me.

434
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:09,127
I'd like to order a drink, too.

435
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:12,030
Whiskey, double.

436
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:20,568
So, what are you doing now, Mabel?

437
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:23,643
I sell bait.

438
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:29,913
You have the most beautiful hair
I've ever seen.

439
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:34,022
Should I get it bobbed?

440
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:37,252
No, not in a million years.

441
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:46,458
"The candle burns at both ends.

442
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:49,061
It will not last the night.

443
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:51,606
But, ah, my toes,
and oh, my friends...

444
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:54,176
it gives a lovely light."

445
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:58,170
That's nice.

446
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:16,063
How about to my editor,
the old curmudgeon? Excuse me.

447
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:20,569
He took me off the Anaconda story.
I'm a reporter at The Bee.

448
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:22,297
- I know.
- How do you know?

449
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:24,066
I'm famous.

450
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:27,041
- Fishing newspaperman.
- You know he fishes, too?

451
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:30,978
- I thought everybody knew.
- You've been away a long time.

452
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:34,414
- I'd say so.
- It's seems my editor--

453
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:37,316
- The old curmudgeon.
- Yes, exactly.

454
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:40,412
He's been getting calls.
No names, just threats.

455
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:42,219
Real threats?

456
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:45,920
It's nice to know you're touching
a nerve button.

457
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:47,859
What did they say?

458
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:51,497
What did they say?

459
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:54,764
- What did they say?
- You'll have to cut it out of him.

460
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:59,706
The usual. The boys will come down
and pay me a little visit.

461
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:02,676
Fit you with a pair
or concrete galoshes, see?

462
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:04,679
Exactly.

463
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:08,317
I have to dance.

464
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:24,565
Watch out!

465
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:27,034
Wow!

466
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:59,362
Now, The Muskrat Ramble.

467
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:04,464
Watch it!

468
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:48,278
I'm nowhere near as good as my brother,
but would you do me the honor?

469
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:50,376
I'd love to.

470
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:35,322
"Dear Jessie, As the moon
lingers a moment over the Bitteroots...

471
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:38,764
before its descent
into the invisible...

472
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:42,065
my mind is filled with song.

473
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,572
I find I am humming softly...

474
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:48,508
not to the music,
but something else.

475
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:50,238
Someplace else.

476
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:53,976
A place remembered.

477
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:59,147
A field of grass where no one
seemed to have been except the deer.

478
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:02,418
And the memory is strengthened
by the feeling of you...

479
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,959
dancing in my awkward arms.

480
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:07,487
Norman."

481
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,707
Yes?

482
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:29,444
What's wrong?

483
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:33,181
It's okay, Mother.
Who is this?

484
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,706
I'm Norman Maclean.

485
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:53,799
No, he doesn't have
to post bond.

486
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:56,242
He covers the police beat
and has friends here.

487
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:58,576
Just look at him
and take him home.

488
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:01,616
What did he do?

489
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:05,381
He hit a guy and
the guy is missing a couple of teeth.

490
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:07,979
Why did he hit him?

491
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:13,654
It says, "A remark was passed concerning
the Indian woman he was with."

492
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:16,595
The guy deserved it.

493
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:19,930
We're picking your brother up
too much lately.

494
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,869
Is that right?

495
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:28,102
Besides, he's behind
on the big stud poker game at Lolo.

496
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:31,476
It's not healthy to get behind
on that game at Lolo.

497
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:37,784
- Is he hurt?
- He's not hurt. He's just sick.

498
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:40,253
He drinks too much.

499
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:44,417
At Lolo, they don't drink too much.

500
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:52,232
You better go in
and get your brother.

501
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:31,373
I'm tired and I wanna go to bed

502
00:58:31,474 --> 00:58:35,934
I just had a drink about an hour ago

503
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:39,173
It went right to my head

504
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:41,876
No matter where I roam

505
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:45,819
By land or sea or foam

506
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:50,757
You can always hear me
singing this song

507
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:54,455
Show me the way to go home

508
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:53,677
It you need any money, Paul...

509
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:56,054
or anything else,
I want you to know that--

510
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:59,355
She lives past the slaughterhouse.

511
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,568
I can help.

512
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:10,830
Turn here.

513
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:12,891
Well, chickens haven't come home
to roost yet, Al.

514
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:20,833
Not bad.

515
01:01:22,745 --> 01:01:24,508
Are you all right?

516
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:28,414
- Clara, was that your jelly?
- Yes, it was.

517
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:31,078
It was wonderful.
And is this Norman?

518
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:34,850
Yes, it is.
Yes, we're very proud of him.

519
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:37,551
- Nice to have you back.
- Thank you.

520
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:41,528
Her daughter's turned into a beauty.
There she is.

521
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:45,362
Twenty only a week ago.
She's bright as a light.

522
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:50,362
Mr. Murchison, how are you?

523
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:53,775
How are you?

524
01:01:55,445 --> 01:01:59,643
- Quite well, thank you.
- Good, good.

525
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:03,207
- And this is Paul?
- No, this is Norman.

526
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:09,057
- Oh, Norman! You're looking good.
- Yes. Hasn't he grown up?

527
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:16,790
- Paul's here. Come on.
- I'm sorry, I can't.

528
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:20,835
I'm meeting Jessie Burns' family.
Her brother's coming in from California.

529
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:22,666
Oh, well, now.

530
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:26,435
- I'm late.
- Should we have this girl to dinner?

531
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:28,169
Perhaps, Mother.

532
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:56,294
Well, well!

533
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:58,639
Hello, Paul.

534
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:01,335
- Hi, Sam. Let me borrow those.
- Sure. Why not?

535
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,139
- Hello, Father.
- Son.

536
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:15,417
First shot, bangs it right up there.

537
01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:29,828
The Burns family ran a general store
in a one-store town...

538
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:32,032
and still managed to do badly.

539
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,167
This is Norman.

540
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:40,306
They were Methodists, who my father
called "Baptists who could read."

541
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:42,907
- Pop.
- It's a pleasure.

542
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:44,953
This is my mother.

543
01:03:45,054 --> 01:03:47,750
A pleasure to meet you, Norman.
Jessie tells me you're a poet.

544
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:51,156
- Related to the fishing newspaperman?
- That's my brother.

545
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:54,320
- Jessie says you just got your degree.
- Yes.

546
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:56,488
Jessie was at the university.
She was majoring in--

547
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:58,031
Flapperism.

548
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:01,202
Science, I believe.
Wasn't it?

549
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:04,171
- She dropped out.
- Aunt Sally!

550
01:04:04,273 --> 01:04:06,707
She could learn from you.
Stick-to-itivity.

551
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:09,141
Let the young man breathe.

552
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:12,214
He's not used to all this.
He's a Presbyterian.

553
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:18,045
Oh, Neal! He's here!

554
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:37,104
Jessie's brother Neal stepped off
the train trying to remember...

555
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:39,766
what a Davis Cup tennis player
looked like.

556
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:42,504
You look so good!
He looks a little thin.

557
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:46,343
How are you doing?
You look great!

558
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:50,078
Neal, this is Norman.
Norman, my brother Neal.

559
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:51,380
Hello, boy.

560
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:56,417
- Did you sit up all night?
- I met some nice people.

561
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:59,619
- Did you get my card from Yellowstone?
- What do you think about this tie?

562
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:04,358
- Let him breathe. He just got here.
- Let's go eat.

563
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:09,666
I've got chicken salad sandwiches
in the car and baking chickens at home.

564
01:05:09,772 --> 01:05:13,799
Mrs. Miller has given us cherries.
I can make your favorite pie.

565
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:21,246
- Not the homemade beer.
- Boy, was a good year.

566
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:26,612
Over the lips, past the gums,
look out, stomach, here she comes.

567
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:30,885
What's the first station
out there now?

568
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:34,428
When I traveled that way,
San Berdoo was there.

569
01:05:34,563 --> 01:05:36,861
San Berdoo and a lot of sand...

570
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:40,834
and a lot of desert,
a hell of a lot of desert.

571
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,064
We came back to Salt Lake City.

572
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:46,505
We had to change at Salt Lake City.

573
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:50,010
- There was a hotel there that--
- Served oysters.

574
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:52,808
Served oysters. Yeah.

575
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:56,544
- Norman, do you drink? Does he drink?
- A little bit.

576
01:05:56,652 --> 01:06:00,110
Here's to the ol' fam-damn-ily.

577
01:06:00,222 --> 01:06:03,623
- The tam-damn-ily!
- Here! Here!

578
01:06:03,759 --> 01:06:05,818
Down the trenches.

579
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:09,654
He's fine. He's just tired.
It's a long trip.

580
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:13,291
At least he still has his appetite.

581
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:22,836
How long are you planning to stay?

582
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,639
Sport! Come here.

583
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:31,847
I don't know.
I miss the ocean.

584
01:06:31,954 --> 01:06:33,649
What's it like?

585
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:37,021
It's big and blue.
People ride on the waves.

586
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:40,458
I was getting pretty good at it.

587
01:06:40,563 --> 01:06:44,260
Damn it! Bad dog! Bad!
Geez, Ma!

588
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:47,527
You get him so excited.
Sport.

589
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:53,573
- Anywho, what was I talking about?
- The ocean.

590
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:57,407
Oh, yeah! So we'd ride those waves
all day long, all the boys.

591
01:06:57,513 --> 01:07:00,380
Ramon, me, Ronnie Colman.

592
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:02,075
Ronald Colman?

593
01:07:03,886 --> 01:07:07,879
- I love Ronald Colman.
- People say I look like Ronald Colman.

594
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:10,584
Yeah.

595
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:14,184
I can't picture Ronald Colman
riding on waves.

596
01:07:20,302 --> 01:07:22,600
Some Kodak, huh?

597
01:07:23,606 --> 01:07:25,005
Well, Ma...

598
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:28,273
it's been a long trip.

599
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:35,511
Maybe you could go fishing
with Norman sometime.
