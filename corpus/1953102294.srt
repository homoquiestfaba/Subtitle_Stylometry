1
00:00:34,548 --> 00:00:36,413
Yo, man, come on!

2
00:00:40,821 --> 00:00:42,482
Eighteen to
party, 21 to drink.

3
00:00:42,556 --> 00:00:43,682
Have your IDs ready.

4
00:00:43,757 --> 00:00:45,247
Eighteen to
party, 21 to drink.

5
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:47,259
Have your IDs ready, ladies.

6
00:00:47,361 --> 00:00:49,261
Eighteen to party, 21 to drink.

7
00:01:21,928 --> 00:01:23,225
Oh, my God.

8
00:01:23,897 --> 00:01:26,627
Goddamn, I say I love my job!

9
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:28,864
Come on now, let's go!

10
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:31,731
Now where are all my sexy
Sagittarian ladies at?

11
00:01:32,706 --> 00:01:35,231
Man, where your dollars?
Where your dollars at?

12
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:37,108
Man, she doin' it, y'all.

13
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,370
Chill, chill.

14
00:01:38,445 --> 00:01:39,673
Watchu' come here for?

15
00:01:39,746 --> 00:01:42,044
Oh, come on, baby,
I'm not going to bite.

16
00:01:42,115 --> 00:01:44,447
Sorry, excuse me, sorry.

17
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:04,230
Come on now, let's go.

18
00:02:04,304 --> 00:02:05,931
Yeah, it's your girl K-Sty.

19
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:07,802
You know you're rocking
with your girl K-Sty.

20
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:10,106
We're live at the Catnip Lounge.

21
00:02:16,716 --> 00:02:18,980
Give it up for your girl Maine.

22
00:02:19,085 --> 00:02:21,076
Maine's in the building.

23
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:25,989
Come on, we're late. Huh?

24
00:02:26,092 --> 00:02:27,559
I gotta go. Hold on a minute.

25
00:02:27,794 --> 00:02:29,421
Why you trippin'? What?

26
00:02:29,496 --> 00:02:32,056
I gotta go. Why are you trippin'?
I'm gonna get in trouble.

27
00:02:32,132 --> 00:02:34,100
Let me dance with shortie right
quick and then I'll be ready.

28
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:35,225
What?

29
00:02:37,103 --> 00:02:39,230
Stop pulling on my clothes, yo.

30
00:02:39,306 --> 00:02:40,295
Sorry.

31
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,583
How many numbers you get? One?

32
00:02:54,955 --> 00:02:57,788
I could've gotten more, but your
moms was holdin' me up.

33
00:02:57,858 --> 00:02:59,018
That's messed up.

34
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,820
How many you get? How many you get?

35
00:03:00,927 --> 00:03:02,485
Oh. Let me see.

36
00:03:03,864 --> 00:03:07,163
Tonya, Denise, Shelley...

37
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:09,201
Oh, wait, that's an old one,
I could delete that one.

38
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:10,960
So, Tonya...

39
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:12,470
Hold up. Liar.

40
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:14,530
Ain't Shelley that chick
from your math class?

41
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:16,472
Give me! Denise?

42
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,342
Yo, hold up, these are your damn
study group numbers, yo.

43
00:03:19,446 --> 00:03:20,708
Why you frontin', huh?

44
00:03:20,814 --> 00:03:22,441
I don't see you with
no list of numbers.

45
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:24,380
I'm not the one looking
for a girlfriend, man.

46
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:25,883
You the one still a virgin!

47
00:03:26,853 --> 00:03:28,480
Trying to help your ass, you
know what I'm saying?

48
00:03:28,555 --> 00:03:30,716
I don't know what you
waitin' on. Shit.

49
00:03:31,358 --> 00:03:34,054
Still kickin' that quiet shit
from sixth grade, nigga.

50
00:03:34,294 --> 00:03:36,125
I don't need to press, I gets
plenty. You feel me?

51
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:38,858
Wah-wah. Look, I get more pussy
than your daddy, nigga.

52
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:42,033
What? Okay, you got
me with that one.

53
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:44,069
You got me with that one.
Yeah, I know. I know.

54
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,797
You need to pop that
damn cherry, yo.

55
00:03:45,872 --> 00:03:46,964
Shut up.

56
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,564
That's what you need to do.

57
00:03:56,483 --> 00:03:58,075
Quit playing. Your stop.

58
00:03:58,184 --> 00:03:59,208
Huh?

59
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,752
Your stop. Time to get off.

60
00:04:00,854 --> 00:04:03,015
Nah, I'm gonna roll with you
a few more stops, a'ight?

61
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:04,886
Why are you gonna go all the
way up to come back down?

62
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:06,083
Make sure you get home safe.

63
00:04:06,192 --> 00:04:07,318
I don't need your protection.

64
00:04:07,394 --> 00:04:09,225
You ain't big, nigga,
get off. Hey, yo!

65
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:10,557
That's a'ight, man.

66
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:12,063
Yo, yo, yo. Next stop.

67
00:04:12,165 --> 00:04:13,359
A'ight? Would you get off the bus?

68
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:15,424
Yo, what you pushin' me for?
Why're you beastin'?

69
00:04:15,535 --> 00:04:17,799
I'm not beastin'. Just get off!

70
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,569
Tsk.

71
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:27,008
You got a problem. Yo, call me.

72
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,909
I'll call you. Bye.

73
00:06:06,346 --> 00:06:07,938
You're late. Be quiet.

74
00:06:08,014 --> 00:06:09,572
Where you been this late? Movies.

75
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:11,480
Movies ended at midnight.

76
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:13,449
Shut up. Don't push me.

77
00:06:13,687 --> 00:06:15,314
I know what stays open
past midnight.

78
00:06:15,422 --> 00:06:17,447
Good for you. Go to sleep.

79
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:20,416
Goodnight, Lee.

80
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:22,353
Lee?

81
00:06:27,267 --> 00:06:29,599
Nice to know you still live here.

82
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,703
What are you doing home
so late, anyway?

83
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:34,470
Lost track of time.

84
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,941
You know what time your curfew is.

85
00:06:37,143 --> 00:06:38,201
Where were you?

86
00:06:38,545 --> 00:06:39,773
Movies.

87
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:41,544
The movie ended at midnight

88
00:06:41,648 --> 00:06:42,876
and your curfew's at 12:30.

89
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:44,779
I lost track of time.

90
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:50,949
Well, at least you were cute.

91
00:06:51,224 --> 00:06:53,385
I like that shirt. Where'd
you get that from?

92
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:54,551
Angel.

93
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:55,855
It's old.

94
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,222
Really compliments your figure.

95
00:06:58,331 --> 00:07:00,390
You know, maybe we can go shopping.
I saw one just like it...

96
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,990
Goodnight, Ma.

97
00:07:03,403 --> 00:07:04,836
You know what?

98
00:07:04,938 --> 00:07:07,372
I don't like that young lady
that you run around with.

99
00:07:07,474 --> 00:07:08,498
Yeah, okay!

100
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:10,940
Yeah, okay! And tie up your head.

101
00:07:11,678 --> 00:07:13,202
It's your head.

102
00:07:13,847 --> 00:07:15,678
And wash your face, too!
I don't have makeup on.

103
00:07:15,782 --> 00:07:16,840
Wash your face, anyway!

104
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,349
Mom, I'm seventeen years
old. Can you please...

105
00:07:18,451 --> 00:07:20,544
You need to watch your tone!

106
00:07:23,223 --> 00:07:24,815
It's your skin.

107
00:08:23,383 --> 00:08:25,044
All right, as
I promised, people,

108
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:27,450
these will be graded on a curve.

109
00:08:27,787 --> 00:08:30,688
So, you're not going to get a whole
lot of help unfortunately

110
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:35,660
because the highest score
on the test was a 98.

111
00:08:35,728 --> 00:08:37,559
This wasn't
even in the study guide...

112
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,222
Guys, I gave you all the answers

113
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,290
and the questions on
the review sheets.

114
00:08:41,401 --> 00:08:43,426
It was on the test. I didn't
say that.

115
00:08:43,536 --> 00:08:46,562
Y'all have a good lunch.
I'll see y'all tomorrow.

116
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,106
Study, people.

117
00:09:09,596 --> 00:09:10,722
Hey, girl. Hi.

118
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:12,893
How you doing?

119
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:14,331
Talk to me.

120
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:18,732
You eat that shit?

121
00:09:18,838 --> 00:09:20,999
I do. I don't know about
what you eatin'.

122
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:23,237
Tastes good. You should try it.

123
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:26,278
Yeah, listen, hummus will keep
me alive longer than that.

124
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,277
So, where's the new stuff?

125
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:31,677
Here you go.

126
00:09:44,264 --> 00:09:45,356
Hmm.

127
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:48,964
Do you see the one in the back?

128
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:51,560
I'm gonna... I'll probably
do that in class.

129
00:09:58,311 --> 00:09:59,471
Hmm.

130
00:10:06,619 --> 00:10:07,643
So?

131
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:09,111
So what?

132
00:10:09,188 --> 00:10:10,280
So what'd you think?

133
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:11,753
Yeah, they're okay.

134
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:12,950
Okay?

135
00:10:13,593 --> 00:10:15,424
Well, they're lovely.

136
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:18,490
I mean, of course your
descriptiveness

137
00:10:18,598 --> 00:10:21,658
and your use of alliteration
are beautiful and all, but

138
00:10:21,768 --> 00:10:23,133
you know that.

139
00:10:23,202 --> 00:10:25,033
But I don't know, is it your best?

140
00:10:25,138 --> 00:10:26,162
No.

141
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:28,466
I thought it was good.

142
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,475
They're okay. Not great.

143
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:33,702
I think you can go deeper.

144
00:10:39,385 --> 00:10:40,977
I'm not
able to take your call.

145
00:10:41,054 --> 00:10:42,681
Please leave a message at
the sound of the tone.

146
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:44,120
Peace.

147
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,368
Hey, this is Lee, I'm not
able to take your call...

148
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:01,030
How's it coming?

149
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:02,538
It's good.

150
00:11:12,185 --> 00:11:13,379
Let me know if you need me.

151
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:21,419
I don't see why we can't just
watch TV like usual.

152
00:11:21,527 --> 00:11:22,551
Shut up.

153
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:24,721
You shut up! AUDREY: Girls!

154
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:29,701
I was expecting a call.

155
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,764
Hello?

156
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:38,601
Yeah.

157
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:41,108
It's your father's night off.

158
00:11:41,214 --> 00:11:42,738
Straighten up.

159
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:51,852
So, Homecoming
got moved up this year.

160
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:54,518
It's actually going to be in September
instead of October.

161
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:56,391
Really? Yeah, which
means that I can actually

162
00:11:56,462 --> 00:11:58,362
go to the Autumn Ball and
the Homecoming Dance.

163
00:11:58,431 --> 00:11:59,557
Who're you going to go with?

164
00:11:59,632 --> 00:12:01,862
I don't know, uh, maybe
Derek, if he asks me.

165
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:03,026
Or maybe Parrish.

166
00:12:03,102 --> 00:12:05,297
But I know for Homecoming that I
definitely want to go with Craig.

167
00:12:07,106 --> 00:12:09,097
And who are you going
to go with, Lee?

168
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,698
I'm not going.

169
00:12:11,277 --> 00:12:13,211
What do you mean,
you're not going?

170
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,405
It's your junior year!

171
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,538
Leave her alone, Audrey.

172
00:12:15,615 --> 00:12:17,549
If she doesn't want to go,
she doesn't have to go.

173
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:20,211
But she's a junior. She's not
going to have any memories!

174
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:21,378
I don't like all those boys

175
00:12:21,454 --> 00:12:23,479
buzzing around my daughters anyway.
Nobody's buzzing around Alike.

176
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:25,216
That's right, and
it better stay that way.

177
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,815
Matter of fact, I'm not sure
if I'm gonna let you go.

178
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:28,416
Dad!

179
00:12:28,594 --> 00:12:30,255
Shut up!

180
00:12:31,597 --> 00:12:33,588
So what are your memories, Mother?

181
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,391
I got plenty of memories.

182
00:12:35,468 --> 00:12:36,901
Like?

183
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,629
I'm just saying, share with us.

184
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:40,899
Did you go to prom?

185
00:12:40,973 --> 00:12:42,235
Yes, I went to prom.

186
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:44,037
Who'd you go with?

187
00:12:44,977 --> 00:12:46,740
Are you comfortable with this?

188
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,105
I'm fine. She asked you.

189
00:12:49,215 --> 00:12:50,648
Did you have sex at prom?

190
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,047
Hey, hey, hey!

191
00:12:52,118 --> 00:12:53,949
Relax.

192
00:12:54,454 --> 00:12:56,251
I'm definitely
having sex at prom.

193
00:12:56,589 --> 00:12:57,715
Oh, my God!

194
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,417
No, you're definitely
not going to prom.

195
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:01,790
You're not having sex for
10 more years, so...

196
00:13:02,462 --> 00:13:03,554
Ten years?

197
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:04,926
At least.

198
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:06,726
That's like 25!

199
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:07,788
Exactly. That's early for me.

200
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:09,027
That's an inappropriate question.

201
00:13:09,102 --> 00:13:11,730
Is that how old you
were when you first had sex?

202
00:13:11,804 --> 00:13:12,964
That's how old you'll
be when you find out.

203
00:13:13,072 --> 00:13:14,835
This isn't dinner conversation.

204
00:13:15,274 --> 00:13:16,639
Guys...

205
00:13:26,252 --> 00:13:28,686
Oh. Oh, my God.

206
00:13:30,356 --> 00:13:32,085
That's just embarrassing, girl.

207
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:33,284
You ain't got
no range either!

208
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:35,156
Well, at least I hit
the backboard, damn.

209
00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:40,489
Help! I'm getting mugged!

210
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:44,495
Girl. Come on, what's the score?

211
00:13:44,937 --> 00:13:46,029
One up.

212
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:47,197
One? Yup.

213
00:13:47,306 --> 00:13:49,866
Girl, I got at least three.
Definitely three, come on.

214
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:51,375
You trying to cheat me, too?

215
00:13:54,046 --> 00:13:55,308
Help me!

216
00:14:37,156 --> 00:14:39,021
Hey! Hey, hey.

217
00:14:39,392 --> 00:14:40,654
Mind if I sit here?

218
00:14:40,726 --> 00:14:42,193
Sure, go ahead. Help yourself.

219
00:14:42,261 --> 00:14:44,092
Oh, thank you.

220
00:14:44,597 --> 00:14:46,394
What you got there?
You been shopping?

221
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:48,490
Mmm-mmm. Just some yogurt.

222
00:14:49,168 --> 00:14:50,760
Some vanilla yogurt.

223
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,735
No, I mean in the bag.

224
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:55,666
What do you got in the bag?
That big red thing?

225
00:14:55,741 --> 00:14:57,003
Oh...

226
00:14:57,076 --> 00:14:59,010
I don't know where my
mind is.

227
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:00,443
That's okay. Um...

228
00:15:00,546 --> 00:15:02,036
Yeah, let me... Let
me show it to you.

229
00:15:02,114 --> 00:15:03,911
Okay. Can I get your opinion?

230
00:15:05,218 --> 00:15:06,446
Oh.

231
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,687
That's really nice.

232
00:15:08,754 --> 00:15:09,778
Isn't that cute?

233
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:11,754
Yeah! Is that for your daughter?

234
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,721
Yeah, yeah. It's for Alike.

235
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:15,590
Oh, the youngest one.

236
00:15:16,095 --> 00:15:17,528
No, the oldest one.

237
00:15:17,763 --> 00:15:19,560
Oh, the other one.

238
00:15:19,632 --> 00:15:21,964
Oh. Okay. Yeah.

239
00:15:22,969 --> 00:15:24,732
Why, you think it's too young?

240
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:26,931
Oh, no! For some reason
the youngest one

241
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,064
just popped into my head
first, that's all.

242
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:31,907
Oh, but I think it'll be fine.

243
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:33,342
Oh, it's really nice.

244
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:34,674
Thank you. Yeah.

245
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:36,840
And you know what, it'll
compliment her figure.

246
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,781
You see, that's what
I thought. Yeah.

247
00:15:38,884 --> 00:15:40,249
For some reason, Lee
just doesn't like

248
00:15:40,353 --> 00:15:42,014
anything I pick out
for her anymore.

249
00:15:42,088 --> 00:15:43,453
Oh, girl, please.

250
00:15:43,556 --> 00:15:46,616
My oldest has banned me from
buying her any more clothes.

251
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,251
I just get her gift cards now.

252
00:15:49,362 --> 00:15:50,852
Trust me, we're both
happier for it.

253
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,864
She needs to go
on a diet. Anyway...

254
00:15:55,401 --> 00:15:57,028
Hey, Brenda! Hey!

255
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,529
Audrey, you got me a present!

256
00:15:59,605 --> 00:16:00,799
No, I didn't.

257
00:16:00,906 --> 00:16:02,134
What y'all in here talking about?

258
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:04,072
None of your damn business.

259
00:16:04,143 --> 00:16:05,405
Let me know how it goes, okay?

260
00:16:05,478 --> 00:16:06,945
Okay, I will. Hey, Bren...

261
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:08,946
This is the article I was
telling you about.

262
00:16:09,048 --> 00:16:10,709
Oh, no. Is that her?

263
00:16:10,783 --> 00:16:12,808
I told you! Look how
big she done got!

264
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:15,819
Oh, my gosh, that's a shame!

265
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:17,650
Isn't that crazy?

266
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:36,833
So, it was,
like, seven of us.

267
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:39,467
Me, Khalil, Misha, Tamara...

268
00:16:39,578 --> 00:16:40,977
Tamara Marks?

269
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,172
Hell, no. Fat Tamara.

270
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:44,613
Oh, I was about to say.
Tamara Marks is a...

271
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,308
Uh, I can't stand her.

272
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:48,751
Anyway, it was all of
us, and oh, Laura.

273
00:16:48,821 --> 00:16:49,845
You know that girl from
the restaurant?

274
00:16:49,955 --> 00:16:51,320
She was there with one
of her friends.

275
00:16:51,424 --> 00:16:52,914
The gay chick?

276
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:54,823
Y'all be hanging out like that?

277
00:16:56,429 --> 00:16:58,124
Anyway, there's
a couple of them.

278
00:16:58,197 --> 00:17:00,131
She's mad cool though, so she come
out with us every now and...

279
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:01,826
Man, y'all be doing it
big on the weekends.

280
00:17:01,934 --> 00:17:02,958
Let me know!

281
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:04,798
- I told your butt to come.
- But anyway...

282
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,498
Yo, some of them AGs
are kinda cute.

283
00:17:07,606 --> 00:17:10,370
I'm not saying I would,
but I'll holla.

284
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:12,101
I don't know
about all that.

285
00:17:12,178 --> 00:17:13,941
Yo, isn't that one of
them over there?

286
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,642
What's her name? Amika? Alisha?

287
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:19,014
Alike.

288
00:17:19,118 --> 00:17:20,210
Yeah, Alike.

289
00:17:21,287 --> 00:17:22,481
She's cute, too.

290
00:17:23,122 --> 00:17:24,646
I don't be looking
at them like that.

291
00:17:24,724 --> 00:17:28,387
Look, I'm not gay, but if I was
gay, I might talk to her!

292
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:29,791
She's in the middle anyway.

293
00:17:29,862 --> 00:17:33,298
Yeah, I know, if she was just
a little bit harder...

294
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,995
'Sup, ladies.

295
00:17:36,902 --> 00:17:38,529
Oh, hey. Hey, what's up?

296
00:17:38,637 --> 00:17:39,695
What's going on? Hey.

297
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:41,136
What's good? What's
good with that party?

298
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:42,333
What's good with this hat?

299
00:17:44,744 --> 00:17:45,802
Don't play me.

300
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:46,970
Yo!

301
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:50,015
Oh, Mika, you act like
you bi or something.

302
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:53,011
I like girls. I love boys.

303
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:54,245
I can't tell!

304
00:17:54,353 --> 00:17:55,877
Whatever!

305
00:17:56,188 --> 00:17:57,246
So what do you think?

306
00:17:57,356 --> 00:17:59,017
Watch out, it's slippery.

307
00:17:59,091 --> 00:18:01,150
I already told you what I think.

308
00:18:01,227 --> 00:18:02,660
But you know her.

309
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:04,889
I know of her, but I don't
"know her" know her.

310
00:18:04,997 --> 00:18:07,898
Okay, you know her friend.
Can you hook us up?

311
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:10,762
Yo, put that stack over there.

312
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:12,497
Um...

313
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:14,566
Yo, pass me that rice.

314
00:18:14,673 --> 00:18:15,697
Are you listening?

315
00:18:15,808 --> 00:18:17,036
Yeah, I'm listening, man!

316
00:18:17,143 --> 00:18:19,202
All I'm saying is that
I don't think

317
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:21,541
you should be putting yourself
out there like that.

318
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:23,376
Especially if you don't know
she like you like that.

319
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:24,506
She does.

320
00:18:32,158 --> 00:18:33,420
She does?

321
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:36,891
How do you know she does?

322
00:18:36,996 --> 00:18:38,759
I just know she does.

323
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:43,201
Hmm. We'll see.

324
00:18:46,505 --> 00:18:48,029
What are you doing?

325
00:18:48,107 --> 00:18:49,665
Thought I felt a drop of pig shit.

326
00:18:49,742 --> 00:18:51,869
Shut... Shut the fuck up!

327
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:54,111
All I know is I've been
trying to get you

328
00:18:54,213 --> 00:18:56,738
to talk to chicks for the
longest in the club.

329
00:18:57,516 --> 00:18:58,915
I don't want to holla
at girls at the club.

330
00:18:59,185 --> 00:19:00,516
Obviously.

331
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:03,279
So, why are you so pressed
about this one?

332
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:07,416
I wanted to ask you something
else, too.

333
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:09,085
What?

334
00:19:09,428 --> 00:19:11,589
I need you to get something for me.

335
00:19:11,697 --> 00:19:12,755
What?

336
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:17,361
What?

337
00:19:17,703 --> 00:19:19,364
Just for my image.

338
00:19:21,874 --> 00:19:22,966
What?

339
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:25,271
You trying to strap, yo?

340
00:19:25,377 --> 00:19:27,368
Oh, my God, yo!

341
00:19:27,446 --> 00:19:28,538
What are you going through?

342
00:19:28,614 --> 00:19:29,774
By next Friday, please.

343
00:19:29,882 --> 00:19:30,940
Next Friday?

344
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,574
Please. All right.

345
00:19:32,651 --> 00:19:34,118
Okay, whatever. I mean...

346
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,450
Oh, my God, yo!

347
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:38,113
She better be cute for this, yo.

348
00:19:38,891 --> 00:19:41,086
That's all I know, she
better be cute.

349
00:19:42,495 --> 00:19:43,826
I think it looks natural.

350
00:19:45,965 --> 00:19:47,830
I'm serious, I mean, it
doesn't look that bad.

351
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:49,230
I can't believe you.

352
00:19:49,301 --> 00:19:50,393
What?

353
00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:52,801
Laura, this looks stupid!
It doesn't look right!

354
00:19:52,905 --> 00:19:54,167
Well, first of all,
it's not supposed

355
00:19:54,273 --> 00:19:56,104
to be over your underwear
like that.

356
00:19:56,175 --> 00:19:57,608
I'm not putting this thing
next to my skin.

357
00:19:57,676 --> 00:19:59,769
It already pinches! It's supposed
to fit like that.

358
00:20:00,012 --> 00:20:01,104
They didn't have brown?

359
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,477
I didn't have time for all of that!

360
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:04,345
And plus the brown ones are
too big for you anyway.

361
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:05,542
It's not funny!

362
00:20:05,651 --> 00:20:06,811
Here, you gotta take it back.

363
00:20:06,886 --> 00:20:08,114
I can't take it back.

364
00:20:08,187 --> 00:20:09,449
No, here's the receipt!

365
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:10,614
Yo, I'm not going back in there.

366
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:12,384
One time was embarrassing
enough. No.

367
00:20:12,491 --> 00:20:13,617
You grown! So what?

368
00:20:13,692 --> 00:20:16,490
What if someone see me in there?
No, I'm not going back!

369
00:20:16,562 --> 00:20:18,393
Then where's my change?

370
00:20:18,497 --> 00:20:19,896
Lee, where'd you put my makeup.

371
00:20:20,132 --> 00:20:21,656
Ooh, I'm telling.

372
00:20:21,734 --> 00:20:23,827
Hey! Hey, get off of me!

373
00:20:23,903 --> 00:20:25,530
Stop! Stop!

374
00:20:25,638 --> 00:20:27,230
Get off of me with
that thing, geez!

375
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:28,465
Be quiet! Okay. Be quiet!

376
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:29,838
I'm telling you got that!
You can't tell.

377
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:31,399
I'm telling! Shut up!

378
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,636
Gosh, it looks nasty!

379
00:20:32,711 --> 00:20:33,803
See, I told you so!

380
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:35,710
Yeah, whatever. Where's my makeup
case? I know you've got it.

381
00:20:35,848 --> 00:20:36,974
I just borrowed it.

382
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:39,040
Okay, well, give it back!

383
00:20:39,585 --> 00:20:40,813
Take it.

384
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:42,145
Promise you won't tell.

385
00:20:42,221 --> 00:20:43,313
Just give it back!

386
00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:44,481
Promise you won't tell.

387
00:20:44,557 --> 00:20:46,218
All right! All right,
all right, all right.

388
00:20:46,325 --> 00:20:47,656
All right, I won't tell. Okay?

389
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:51,521
Geez.

390
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:54,525
I'm still telling.

391
00:20:55,034 --> 00:20:56,092
Telling what?

392
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:57,668
She took my makeup again!

393
00:20:57,836 --> 00:20:59,531
Lee, please stop with the...

394
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:01,937
Oh, hello, Laura. I didn't see
you standing over there.

395
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:03,840
Hello, Mrs. Freeman.

396
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:05,001
How's your mother?

397
00:21:05,077 --> 00:21:07,045
I haven't spoken to her in a while.

398
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:08,774
She's fine.

399
00:21:08,881 --> 00:21:09,939
I hope so.

400
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:12,244
And I was glad to hear that your sister
finally got back on her feet.

401
00:21:12,318 --> 00:21:13,808
Mom! Mom! She's good, she's good.

402
00:21:23,128 --> 00:21:24,720
No, I don't think so.

403
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:26,230
We leave this door open.

404
00:21:26,298 --> 00:21:28,732
Let a little fresh air
circulate in here.

405
00:21:29,435 --> 00:21:31,869
I was just about to
leave anyway, so...

406
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:33,268
Mom?

407
00:21:35,641 --> 00:21:36,903
Just try it.

408
00:21:42,247 --> 00:21:44,545
Chill, you just
got to get used to it.

409
00:21:44,617 --> 00:21:45,743
Stop touching it like that,

410
00:21:45,818 --> 00:21:46,978
people gonna think
you got something.

411
00:21:47,086 --> 00:21:48,747
The string hurts. I'm
going to take it off.

412
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:50,413
You're not going to take it off.
I'm going to take it off.

413
00:21:50,489 --> 00:21:51,979
Where you gonna take it off
at? In the bathroom.

414
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:53,149
Then where are you going to put it?

415
00:21:53,225 --> 00:21:54,920
You going to walk around the club
with a dick in your hand?

416
00:21:54,994 --> 00:21:56,757
I mean, chill, man, you're straight
blowing me right now, yo.

417
00:21:56,829 --> 00:21:57,921
Then I'm out. No, you're not!

418
00:21:57,997 --> 00:21:59,089
You're about to go
through with this.

419
00:21:59,164 --> 00:22:00,290
You're the one that wanted
to meet her, not me.

420
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:01,457
Okay, then come on then, let's go.

421
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:02,966
All right, man, chill.

422
00:22:03,102 --> 00:22:04,433
Hey.

423
00:22:04,637 --> 00:22:06,730
Where are my AGs at?
Where are my butches at?

424
00:22:06,805 --> 00:22:08,636
Throw your hands in the
air. Let's get it.

425
00:22:20,085 --> 00:22:21,416
You all right?

426
00:22:21,487 --> 00:22:24,854
Yeah, um, I think there's a spring
in the cushion or something.

427
00:22:27,926 --> 00:22:29,325
You wanna switch seats?

428
00:22:29,428 --> 00:22:30,918
Nah, I'm good.

429
00:22:33,132 --> 00:22:34,929
And you don't wanna dance?

430
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,434
Hey, yo, we gonna go dance, a'ight?

431
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:40,463
Nah, I'm not really
feeling the music.

432
00:22:45,678 --> 00:22:46,804
Well, look, you don't mind, right,

433
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:48,437
if I go dance with somebody else?

434
00:22:48,514 --> 00:22:50,209
Nah, do your thing.

435
00:22:52,317 --> 00:22:53,682
If you change your mind, we...

436
00:22:53,752 --> 00:22:55,515
Nah, it's cool.

437
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:05,984
Turn that mess off!

438
00:24:06,492 --> 00:24:07,959
Sharonda!

439
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,153
Sharonda, stop lollygagging!

440
00:24:10,796 --> 00:24:12,889
Lee! Are you ready?

441
00:24:12,965 --> 00:24:14,057
Yup.

442
00:24:17,236 --> 00:24:18,601
I said off.

443
00:24:20,506 --> 00:24:21,973
And I thought you said
you were ready?

444
00:24:22,074 --> 00:24:23,132
I am ready.

445
00:24:23,242 --> 00:24:24,971
You're not going to church in that!

446
00:24:25,043 --> 00:24:26,271
What's wrong with this?

447
00:24:26,345 --> 00:24:27,778
Where's that blouse I bought you?

448
00:24:27,846 --> 00:24:29,313
What's wrong with this?

449
00:24:30,516 --> 00:24:31,608
Dad!

450
00:24:31,683 --> 00:24:32,980
Do what your mom says.

451
00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:35,446
Are you hungry? Here, let
me heat this up for you.

452
00:24:35,521 --> 00:24:36,613
That's okay. Oh, it tastes
so much better.

453
00:24:36,688 --> 00:24:37,814
Dad...

454
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,653
Lee! Leave me out of it.

455
00:24:39,725 --> 00:24:40,817
Now go get changed.

456
00:24:40,893 --> 00:24:42,360
Dad, what's wrong with this outfit?

457
00:24:42,461 --> 00:24:43,553
See.

458
00:24:43,662 --> 00:24:44,788
I'm not going to argue with you.

459
00:24:44,863 --> 00:24:46,387
Do what she says. Dad!

460
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:49,494
And put on a skirt!

461
00:24:52,971 --> 00:24:54,336
Give me a beer, please.

462
00:24:54,406 --> 00:24:55,634
It's Sunday morning.

463
00:24:55,874 --> 00:24:57,967
It goes with the spaghetti.

464
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,749
Too much lip gloss.

465
00:25:12,224 --> 00:25:13,919
Did you talk to her?

466
00:25:14,026 --> 00:25:15,425
Sharonda's fine.

467
00:25:15,527 --> 00:25:17,392
I'm talking about Lee. Alike.

468
00:25:17,496 --> 00:25:18,827
And I don't see that
there's a problem.

469
00:25:19,198 --> 00:25:22,258
I'm tired of this whole tomboy
thing she's been doing.

470
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:23,425
And Laura.

471
00:25:24,236 --> 00:25:25,669
You said that you were
going to handle it.

472
00:25:25,737 --> 00:25:26,829
Mmm-hmm.

473
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:28,896
She needs a male point of view!

474
00:25:29,007 --> 00:25:31,032
I said okay, damn it.

475
00:25:34,513 --> 00:25:36,572
Do you have to work tonight?

476
00:25:36,682 --> 00:25:40,083
To put food on the table and
clothes on our backs, no.

477
00:25:40,152 --> 00:25:43,747
To go out to restaurants and keep
designer sneakers in the closet, yes.

478
00:25:43,822 --> 00:25:45,380
Are you forever gonna be mad?

479
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:48,155
Are you forever gonna be happy?

480
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,220
You made that decision
a long time ago.

481
00:25:52,264 --> 00:25:54,289
We both made sacrifices.

482
00:25:58,237 --> 00:26:00,137
You look beautiful,
baby.

483
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:01,570
Tuck your blouse in.

484
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,471
Tuck it in.

485
00:26:03,575 --> 00:26:05,065
Leave it out.

486
00:26:06,078 --> 00:26:07,568
I think it's fine out.

487
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:12,644
Are you coming with us?

488
00:26:12,751 --> 00:26:14,241
Nope. Sleep.

489
00:26:14,353 --> 00:26:16,321
We could do a later service.
Maybe the one o'clock.

490
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:18,252
I said no! SHARONDA: I'm ready!

491
00:26:18,824 --> 00:26:20,655
Sharonda, Alike, you
look beautiful.

492
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:23,091
Everybody looks beautiful, okay?

493
00:26:34,606 --> 00:26:35,664
Well, fine then.

494
00:26:35,774 --> 00:26:37,537
Stop hitting me. Put
this one in then.

495
00:26:37,643 --> 00:26:39,133
"God's love"? I don't
think so. Put it in.

496
00:26:39,211 --> 00:26:40,303
Stop! Put in that one.

497
00:26:40,379 --> 00:26:42,370
Audrey, hey! Hi!

498
00:26:42,481 --> 00:26:44,210
How're you doing, girl? All right.

499
00:26:46,551 --> 00:26:47,711
I'm not touching you. Stop!

500
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:50,049
I'm not touching you!
Sharonda, stop!

501
00:26:50,155 --> 00:26:51,213
Ouch!

502
00:26:51,323 --> 00:26:53,484
Lee, there's somebody I want you
to meet. That's just mean.

503
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:55,822
Huh? Here's somebody
I want you to meet.

504
00:26:56,194 --> 00:26:57,422
Oh, hi.

505
00:26:58,096 --> 00:27:00,758
Get down out of the
car and come speak!

506
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:05,861
What's wrong with you?
All right, Mom.

507
00:27:06,338 --> 00:27:07,532
You'll have to excuse my daughter,

508
00:27:07,606 --> 00:27:09,005
she's been feeling rude lately.

509
00:27:09,074 --> 00:27:10,541
Oh, don't worry about it.

510
00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:12,236
I understand how it is.

511
00:27:12,344 --> 00:27:14,938
Hormones, you know.
It's just a phase.

512
00:27:15,681 --> 00:27:18,741
Alike, this is Mrs. Singletary,
one of my coworkers,

513
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,215
and her daughter Bina.

514
00:27:20,285 --> 00:27:21,445
Hi.

515
00:27:22,788 --> 00:27:24,847
And that's my youngest
daughter Sharonda.

516
00:27:24,923 --> 00:27:27,050
Hey. MRS. SINGLETARY: Hi,
there. Nice to meet you.

517
00:27:29,061 --> 00:27:31,120
Lee, Bina goes to your school.

518
00:27:31,296 --> 00:27:32,388
Cool.

519
00:27:32,464 --> 00:27:35,956
Yeah, I think I've seen you around,
um, Mrs. Alvarado's class?

520
00:27:36,068 --> 00:27:37,467
AP English?

521
00:27:37,569 --> 00:27:38,695
Yup.

522
00:27:40,072 --> 00:27:41,801
Well, now that we're all acquainted
with one another,

523
00:27:41,907 --> 00:27:42,965
let's not be strangers.

524
00:27:43,075 --> 00:27:45,475
Oh, no, no, we won't. Right, honey?

525
00:27:46,611 --> 00:27:47,771
Bina, you know, I think you two

526
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:48,971
even go to school the same way.

527
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:50,378
Oh!
Well, you know,

528
00:27:50,449 --> 00:27:52,542
there's something to be said about
safety in numbers, right?

529
00:27:52,617 --> 00:27:53,879
Yup. Yeah.

530
00:27:55,654 --> 00:27:57,815
Well, you know,
we need to be pushing off.

531
00:27:57,923 --> 00:27:59,914
I'll call you about
the VBS workbooks.

532
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:01,550
All righty. All righty.
Take care. All right?

533
00:28:01,626 --> 00:28:03,093
Great. Come on, honey. Bye!

534
00:28:03,161 --> 00:28:04,389
So,
where you wanna go?

535
00:28:04,463 --> 00:28:05,794
Um, I want to get those pancakes.

536
00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:12,000
Oops.

537
00:28:12,104 --> 00:28:13,537
You're funny.

538
00:28:13,872 --> 00:28:15,669
I don't know what your problem is.

539
00:28:15,774 --> 00:28:16,866
Mom, can you
put this in please?

540
00:28:16,975 --> 00:28:19,034
I don't know what you think
this is going to change.

541
00:28:19,678 --> 00:28:21,771
I know God doesn't make mistakes.

542
00:28:23,482 --> 00:28:24,847
I know that.

543
00:28:26,284 --> 00:28:27,774
Now, you may not like Bina,

544
00:28:27,853 --> 00:28:29,616
but you're going to be spending
a whole lot less time

545
00:28:29,688 --> 00:28:30,814
with that Laura person.

546
00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:32,447
Mom, can you just put this in?
I can guarantee you that.

547
00:28:32,524 --> 00:28:34,219
No, shh, be quiet, I'm not
putting anything in.

548
00:28:34,326 --> 00:28:36,692
I'm going to listen to what I want
to listen to for a change.

549
00:28:41,933 --> 00:28:43,457
Look, I just don't like lying
to my mother, that's all.

550
00:28:43,535 --> 00:28:45,332
So then don't, she doesn't
have to know.

551
00:28:45,404 --> 00:28:47,463
Yes, she does, she
asks me every day!

552
00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:49,029
So, then, tell her yeah.

553
00:28:49,207 --> 00:28:51,232
No! I don't want to lie
just to cover for you.

554
00:28:51,343 --> 00:28:52,571
So don't!

555
00:28:52,677 --> 00:28:56,807
Look, Alike, or Lee or whatever
it is you want to be called,

556
00:28:56,882 --> 00:28:59,009
I'm really not trying to hang
out with you either, okay,

557
00:28:59,084 --> 00:29:00,711
but I'm not about to
take an L for it.

558
00:29:00,819 --> 00:29:01,877
So just stop dodging me!

559
00:29:01,987 --> 00:29:03,386
Let's just go to school
together and then...

560
00:29:03,488 --> 00:29:05,440
Then it's over with, we don't
have to hang out with

561
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,321
each other after that.

562
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:07,551
You know what, whatever!

563
00:29:07,692 --> 00:29:09,159
She asks me again I'm
gonna tell her,

564
00:29:09,227 --> 00:29:10,319
and then she's gonna
tell your mother,

565
00:29:10,395 --> 00:29:12,420
and then it's whatever for you.

566
00:29:13,565 --> 00:29:16,056
Hey! Hey, look, I'm sorry!

567
00:29:18,703 --> 00:29:20,261
Look, I'm sorry!

568
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:24,566
Hello, I said I'm sorry!

569
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,969
Yeah, you sorry your mother's
about to bug out.

570
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:29,309
No, for real, I'm sorry.

571
00:29:29,414 --> 00:29:32,281
I didn't mean to be that
way, it's just...

572
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:35,742
Okay, look, I am concerned
my mom will find out,

573
00:29:35,821 --> 00:29:37,550
but it's... But...

574
00:29:37,956 --> 00:29:39,924
It's not like that, it's
just that she's...

575
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:42,149
Look, if you knew my mother,
you'd understand.

576
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,750
She's... Overprotective?

577
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,927
Yeah. Yeah, I know, I've seen her.

578
00:29:46,998 --> 00:29:50,991
I see what she's like, but lots of
people's parents are like that.

579
00:29:51,103 --> 00:29:52,570
Yeah? Yeah.

580
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:55,670
Yeah, but not like mine.

581
00:29:55,774 --> 00:29:58,106
Anyway... Anyway, like I
said, let's just walk.

582
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,105
Thank you so much for
bringing that.

583
00:30:04,316 --> 00:30:05,578
No problem.

584
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,345
You done studying yet?

585
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:08,813
No.

586
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,353
Did you start studying yet?

587
00:30:10,856 --> 00:30:14,019
I'm on chapter nine. Now, stop.

588
00:30:16,795 --> 00:30:18,285
Get them fucking cards out of here.

589
00:30:18,363 --> 00:30:20,024
No, we gonna study these words.

590
00:30:20,132 --> 00:30:21,292
I ain't studying. We can
play 'em like Tonk.

591
00:30:21,366 --> 00:30:23,334
We can play Spades with
these vocabulary cards.

592
00:30:23,435 --> 00:30:24,993
Get outta here, yo. I'm
about to deal you in.

593
00:30:25,103 --> 00:30:26,195
I'm gonna deal you in.

594
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,862
So, listen, I'm gonna work some
more hours so we could...

595
00:30:27,939 --> 00:30:30,134
"Listless, apathetic, having no
interest in anything." That's yours.

596
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:31,573
Listen! I have a job.

597
00:30:31,643 --> 00:30:33,372
I'll work some more hours.
I don't need school.

598
00:30:33,478 --> 00:30:36,538
"Clandestine, secret, hidden,
undercover." Not you.

599
00:30:36,648 --> 00:30:39,048
Annoying, you annoying
me. Like, really.

600
00:30:39,151 --> 00:30:40,846
"Turbulent, violently disturbed...
Come on, yo.

601
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:43,649
"...agitated, unruly."
That's yours.

602
00:30:44,089 --> 00:30:46,887
Anyway, how much we
paid him last time?

603
00:30:48,994 --> 00:30:50,518
Six twenty-five.

604
00:30:50,662 --> 00:30:53,961
So, that's another 275 for
the rest of the month.

605
00:30:54,566 --> 00:30:56,056
Electric?

606
00:30:56,168 --> 00:30:57,260
Half.

607
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,228
Phone?

608
00:30:59,771 --> 00:31:01,170
Let it ride.

609
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:02,331
Gas?

610
00:31:02,407 --> 00:31:03,874
How much is it?

611
00:31:03,942 --> 00:31:05,341
Eighty-five.

612
00:31:05,877 --> 00:31:07,003
Half.

613
00:31:07,512 --> 00:31:08,911
No, mmm-mmm.

614
00:31:09,848 --> 00:31:11,281
Let it ride.

615
00:31:12,784 --> 00:31:13,910
I could get some more hours.

616
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:15,111
No.

617
00:31:16,888 --> 00:31:18,253
You know what you need to do.

618
00:31:18,523 --> 00:31:20,923
Nah, Candy, I can't just dip
out on you like that, man.

619
00:31:21,026 --> 00:31:24,257
Please, I was doing just fine before
you moved in, remember?

620
00:31:24,362 --> 00:31:26,728
You working was only supposed
to be temporary.

621
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:27,924
Remember that?

622
00:31:28,033 --> 00:31:30,593
I'm only gonna work
for a little bit.

623
00:31:31,469 --> 00:31:33,266
Ma would've wanted you to
be done with... Who?

624
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:34,463
Who?

625
00:31:35,207 --> 00:31:37,107
Yo, don't even... Just...
Just stop.

626
00:31:37,209 --> 00:31:38,471
Mom would have wanted you
to be done by now.

627
00:31:38,577 --> 00:31:40,067
Look, I'll get the money
orders in the morning.

628
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,041
I'll look into it.

629
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,253
The next test is coming up soon.

630
00:31:50,322 --> 00:31:52,290
I said I'll look into it.

631
00:31:53,592 --> 00:31:55,787
Without them and their
courageous efforts,

632
00:31:55,894 --> 00:31:57,418
we wouldn't have been able
to pull this off.

633
00:31:58,763 --> 00:32:01,459
Look, it's on again.
Check it out, Free.

634
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,965
Channel Five and Channel Two.

635
00:32:05,337 --> 00:32:07,100
Look who's big time.

636
00:32:07,505 --> 00:32:10,133
Oh, yeah, but my brother
looked clean though.

637
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:13,644
Yeah, you look like, you look
like, uh, that guy on TV.

638
00:32:18,617 --> 00:32:20,209
Oh, yeah...

639
00:32:20,452 --> 00:32:21,612
There's been more of that

640
00:32:21,686 --> 00:32:24,154
since they opened up that
new club 'cross the way.

641
00:32:24,222 --> 00:32:25,780
Excuse me, Miss?

642
00:32:26,458 --> 00:32:27,550
Miss?

643
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:29,991
On certain Fridays they
got this, you know...

644
00:32:30,061 --> 00:32:32,052
Special party going on. Miss?

645
00:32:33,298 --> 00:32:35,163
Or should I say, "Sir"?

646
00:32:35,634 --> 00:32:37,465
Sir? Sir?

647
00:32:38,803 --> 00:32:40,327
Hello? Chill out, Sock.

648
00:32:40,405 --> 00:32:42,236
Hey, my man, you hear
me talking to you?

649
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,666
Hey.

650
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:46,070
Mind your business. Hey!

651
00:32:47,345 --> 00:32:48,744
And a pack of Kool.

652
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,378
Say, I've been trying to
get your attention.

653
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:53,050
Do you go by sir or miss?

654
00:32:54,052 --> 00:32:55,986
Will that be all, ma'am? Yeah.

655
00:32:56,054 --> 00:32:59,217
Look, I just had a simple
question I wanted to ask.

656
00:32:59,324 --> 00:33:00,689
$67.05.

657
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:03,922
See, I just wanna know,
how does pussy taste?

658
00:33:06,431 --> 00:33:07,864
You know, I just want to know
if you go with women

659
00:33:07,932 --> 00:33:09,422
for the taste,

660
00:33:10,001 --> 00:33:13,266
or is it because you too
dry, crusty, and ugly,

661
00:33:13,872 --> 00:33:15,601
so don't no man want you?

662
00:33:20,111 --> 00:33:23,046
I can't lie. The pussy
do taste good.

663
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:25,107
Oh, yeah?

664
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:27,111
Maybe you should try it sometime.

665
00:33:27,252 --> 00:33:30,619
Or better yet, ask your wife
how much she like me.

666
00:33:31,589 --> 00:33:33,113
Fuckin' bulldagger!

667
00:33:33,658 --> 00:33:35,216
He-she dyke! Yeah.

668
00:33:37,595 --> 00:33:38,653
Hey, ask yo' wife!

669
00:33:38,797 --> 00:33:39,923
She told you.

670
00:33:39,998 --> 00:33:41,898
She ain't tell me shit!

671
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:44,467
What the fuck y'all niggas
are laughing for!

672
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:45,763
Oh, shut up, man,

673
00:33:45,837 --> 00:33:48,135
your big mouth got you
in trouble as usual.

674
00:33:48,306 --> 00:33:49,568
Thought you was my friend, Mack.

675
00:33:49,641 --> 00:33:50,903
Oh, man!

676
00:33:51,643 --> 00:33:54,134
But I guess I didn't expect
you to defend me, Free.

677
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:56,447
Way your daughter's running around
here bull-dyke. Say what?

678
00:33:56,781 --> 00:33:58,908
Say what? Hey! Hey,

679
00:33:58,983 --> 00:34:00,507
Come on, he don't mean nothin'.

680
00:34:00,685 --> 00:34:03,245
What? He don't know what
he talking about, man.

681
00:34:03,321 --> 00:34:05,448
He ain't moved outside
of a two mile radius

682
00:34:05,523 --> 00:34:07,787
of where he crawled out
his mama's pussy.

683
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:09,520
He don't know shit! I
been to Poughkeepsie!

684
00:34:09,627 --> 00:34:11,754
Yeah, well, get your Poughkeepsie
ass out my store!

685
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,695
Fuck y'all! I should
arrest your ass.

686
00:34:13,798 --> 00:34:15,425
Man, fuck y'all!

687
00:34:17,502 --> 00:34:19,333
Come, come on, Free.

688
00:34:19,871 --> 00:34:23,329
Don't pay him no mind,
he just talking trash.

689
00:34:27,846 --> 00:34:29,814
...had you all mad. ALIKE:
I wasn't mad.

690
00:34:29,881 --> 00:34:32,349
Yes, you was. Yo, Candy,
I'm home yo.

691
00:34:33,051 --> 00:34:34,746
Getting all crazy.

692
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,683
Damn, this your color, man.

693
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:43,217
So what's the deal, incog-negro?

694
00:34:43,862 --> 00:34:45,557
Ma has me hemmed up.

695
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,924
Your phone ain't broke. You
coulda called a nigga.

696
00:34:49,033 --> 00:34:50,159
My bad. She's got me hanging out

697
00:34:50,235 --> 00:34:51,668
with this chick from
church. It's crazy.

698
00:34:51,736 --> 00:34:52,828
Well, is she making you?

699
00:34:52,904 --> 00:34:55,236
I mean, you a grown-ass
woman, bruh!

700
00:34:56,941 --> 00:34:58,602
Here, put these on.

701
00:35:03,047 --> 00:35:06,175
So I guess the piers is out
for this Saturday, huh?

702
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:09,949
Uh... I don't know if
that's me anymore.

703
00:35:10,688 --> 00:35:12,747
That's hot, yo, you
should rock that.

704
00:35:14,025 --> 00:35:16,721
I was thinking maybe we could
do something different.

705
00:35:17,896 --> 00:35:19,022
Different like what?

706
00:35:19,397 --> 00:35:21,558
I don't know. Like, maybe

707
00:35:21,633 --> 00:35:23,294
check out an open mic or something.

708
00:35:23,535 --> 00:35:26,299
Open mic? Nah, man, there's plenty
of chicks at the piers.

709
00:35:26,404 --> 00:35:28,736
You just gotta be more confident.

710
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:32,567
I mean I haven't even wore
this, you could rock that.

711
00:35:33,311 --> 00:35:34,403
If you want.

712
00:35:35,246 --> 00:35:37,874
But I understand if you got
better things to do.

713
00:35:37,949 --> 00:35:39,576
No. I'm down.

714
00:35:40,218 --> 00:35:42,846
I don't want you getting all
hemmed up. No, seriously...

715
00:35:42,954 --> 00:35:44,285
I'm down for whatever.

716
00:35:46,024 --> 00:35:47,116
Real?

717
00:35:47,192 --> 00:35:48,420
Promise.

718
00:35:49,761 --> 00:35:50,921
A'ight.

719
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,921
I'ma take Saturday off at work,

720
00:35:54,098 --> 00:35:55,963
it's going to be on and
poppin', you feel me?

721
00:35:56,267 --> 00:35:57,859
It's gonna be mad tight.

722
00:35:58,102 --> 00:36:01,162
We goin' get that punani,
yo. Feel me?

723
00:36:01,773 --> 00:36:05,300
They look fake. AUDREY:
No, I think they're happy.

724
00:36:07,345 --> 00:36:08,505
Now, that looks fake.

725
00:36:12,617 --> 00:36:14,642
You should wear your hair
down more often.

726
00:36:14,886 --> 00:36:16,046
Your father likes it up.

727
00:36:18,456 --> 00:36:19,980
It looks nice down.

728
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:22,890
Maybe.

729
00:36:23,628 --> 00:36:24,686
Give this back to Bina's mom

730
00:36:24,796 --> 00:36:26,491
when you go over there
tomorrow night.

731
00:36:27,298 --> 00:36:28,697
Saturday night?

732
00:36:28,967 --> 00:36:31,128
We talked about this.
No, we didn't!

733
00:36:31,336 --> 00:36:33,896
Lee. I had plans this weekend!

734
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,900
Well, you don't have
to go to Bina's.

735
00:36:36,007 --> 00:36:38,407
You can stay here with
me on Saturday night.

736
00:36:39,143 --> 00:36:40,201
God!

737
00:36:43,314 --> 00:36:44,508
Come on.

738
00:36:46,985 --> 00:36:48,885
So you like Destiny's Kids?

739
00:36:48,987 --> 00:36:50,181
Mmm-mmm.

740
00:36:50,688 --> 00:36:51,848
JP?

741
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,321
Nope.

742
00:36:53,391 --> 00:36:54,517
What about Fiddy?

743
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:58,094
No, I don't like any of that
commercial bullshit.

744
00:36:58,296 --> 00:36:59,786
Okay, so who do you like?

745
00:37:00,532 --> 00:37:02,557
Just some underground stuff.

746
00:37:02,634 --> 00:37:04,625
None of that crap they
play on the radio.

747
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,469
Okay, like who?

748
00:37:10,074 --> 00:37:11,701
You know, people you probably
never heard of.

749
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:12,901
Conscious stuff.

750
00:37:12,977 --> 00:37:14,535
Okay, like who?

751
00:37:14,812 --> 00:37:18,646
Like Trees, Black Circle,
Far Front.

752
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:21,150
Far Front? Girl, I know Far Front.

753
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:23,314
Really? Yeah!

754
00:37:24,222 --> 00:37:28,056
What about, um, Trade, or BRawls?

755
00:37:28,459 --> 00:37:30,950
Or what about, um, Mama Dobia?

756
00:37:32,063 --> 00:37:34,623
Uh-oh. What do you know
about Mama Bodia?

757
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:36,157
Let me find out.

758
00:37:36,267 --> 00:37:38,292
See. You
don't even know me.

759
00:37:39,504 --> 00:37:42,530
Oh, hi,
Audrey. Yes, she's here.

760
00:37:43,474 --> 00:37:44,634
Yeah, yeah.

761
00:37:45,143 --> 00:37:46,735
No, no, I understand.

762
00:37:47,345 --> 00:37:48,471
Sure.

763
00:37:49,147 --> 00:37:50,637
Not a problem.

764
00:37:54,118 --> 00:37:56,245
What about rock? It's cool.

765
00:37:56,821 --> 00:37:58,789
All right, I'm out. Wait,
oh, hey, wait, hey.

766
00:37:58,957 --> 00:38:00,925
You gotta check this out.

767
00:38:24,148 --> 00:38:25,376
Wow.

768
00:38:35,426 --> 00:38:36,859
Hello!

769
00:38:37,428 --> 00:38:39,362
Hey. You look nice.

770
00:38:41,666 --> 00:38:43,600
Oh, um, is Lee home?

771
00:38:43,701 --> 00:38:45,601
No, she's not, she's
out with a friend.

772
00:38:45,703 --> 00:38:47,432
Oh, do you know what time she'll
be back? She won't be back.

773
00:38:47,538 --> 00:38:49,005
She's out with a friend
the entire evening.

774
00:38:49,607 --> 00:38:50,938
Oh, 'cause, we was gonna...
You take care.

775
00:38:51,042 --> 00:38:52,566
Goodnight.

776
00:38:53,678 --> 00:38:57,273
The love is gone
but the memory lingers...

777
00:38:58,716 --> 00:39:00,547
Yo, this shit is hot.

778
00:39:01,953 --> 00:39:04,012
Oh, don't you gotta go?

779
00:39:04,622 --> 00:39:06,385
It's cool, I'll... I'll
cover for you.

780
00:39:06,557 --> 00:39:08,218
Nah, I wanna stay.

781
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:16,959
Hey, this is Lee, I'm not
able to take your call.

782
00:39:17,068 --> 00:39:19,696
Please leave a message at the
sound of the tone. Peace.

783
00:39:20,738 --> 00:39:21,898
Hey, yo, where you at, Lee?

784
00:39:22,807 --> 00:39:25,105
Yo, hit me up when you
get here, a'ight?

785
00:39:25,209 --> 00:39:26,369
A'ight?

786
00:39:31,783 --> 00:39:34,274
Come on, man, let's go,
man. A'ight, yo.

787
00:39:34,352 --> 00:39:36,252
What happened? She didn't
fucking show up, man.

788
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,753
Well, you stressing
that shit too much.

789
00:40:12,356 --> 00:40:15,689
Uh, Mrs. Alvarado's trying to get me
to check out one of these places.

790
00:40:16,227 --> 00:40:19,458
Oh, hell, no. This
is for old people.

791
00:40:19,564 --> 00:40:22,795
You know what, I'll write
down some places for you.

792
00:40:24,368 --> 00:40:26,632
And maybe you can read
some of my stuff, too?

793
00:40:26,704 --> 00:40:28,069
Definitely.

794
00:40:47,959 --> 00:40:49,927
Yo, y'all remember when we used to

795
00:40:50,027 --> 00:40:51,961
come out here all night?

796
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,688
Shit, used to.

797
00:40:55,466 --> 00:40:57,263
You staying with your
sister now, huh?

798
00:40:57,368 --> 00:40:58,528
Yeah.

799
00:40:58,936 --> 00:41:01,029
Lucky as hell, man. Think?

800
00:41:26,264 --> 00:41:28,892
My sister be home by six, so,
you gotta be out by then.

801
00:41:29,467 --> 00:41:31,162
A'ight, good-looking.

802
00:41:31,602 --> 00:41:34,002
Yeah, there's some lunch meat in
the fridge if you want some.

803
00:41:34,906 --> 00:41:36,806
I appreciate you. Yeah.

804
00:42:22,753 --> 00:42:24,220
Okay, easy, easy.

805
00:42:24,422 --> 00:42:26,322
Watch the right hand side,
watch the right.

806
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:27,482
I am!

807
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:30,151
Okay. Oh, careful of the curb!

808
00:42:30,228 --> 00:42:32,162
All right. Okay.

809
00:42:32,563 --> 00:42:33,894
Good, good.

810
00:42:36,234 --> 00:42:37,428
See.

811
00:42:37,835 --> 00:42:40,269
I did it. Can I drive
back home? Please?

812
00:42:40,404 --> 00:42:42,235
Uh, I don't know about
all that girl.

813
00:42:42,406 --> 00:42:43,600
You're shaky. You're shaky. Please?

814
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:45,835
Here, here, get us some chips
and we'll think about it.

815
00:42:46,043 --> 00:42:48,443
Come... Give me some
time to consider.

816
00:42:52,717 --> 00:42:53,945
Careful.

817
00:42:58,256 --> 00:42:59,518
Hey, Mack!

818
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:01,417
Hey there. Hey, Mr. Ferguson.

819
00:43:01,525 --> 00:43:02,890
How you doing? I'm good,
how you doing?

820
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,394
I'm all right, I'm
all right. Thanks.

821
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:08,758
Yeah, I see where Alike been
running you around again, huh?

822
00:43:08,866 --> 00:43:09,924
Oh, little bit, little bit,

823
00:43:10,034 --> 00:43:11,194
but you know, I still
got it, though.

824
00:43:11,269 --> 00:43:13,066
Yeah, I remember that crossover
you used to have.

825
00:43:13,137 --> 00:43:14,195
You got to come out there with us

826
00:43:14,272 --> 00:43:17,366
so I can show her what it's
like in the fifties.

827
00:43:22,413 --> 00:43:23,937
Get in the car.

828
00:43:24,282 --> 00:43:27,649
Wait, I'm driving! You said
I could... Get in the car.

829
00:43:45,803 --> 00:43:47,202
Look, um...

830
00:43:48,272 --> 00:43:50,797
You know you're daddy's
girl, right?

831
00:43:59,116 --> 00:44:01,380
"A butterfly,
briefly suffocated

832
00:44:01,485 --> 00:44:03,544

843
00:44:37,154 --> 00:44:38,985
Comments? Critiques?

844
00:44:39,056 --> 00:44:41,047
Julie, tell me what you think.

845
00:44:41,158 --> 00:44:43,558
I like how she described
the butterfly.

846
00:44:43,661 --> 00:44:44,719
I could almost see her...

847
00:44:46,864 --> 00:44:48,764
I liked your story though,
it was tight.

848
00:44:48,866 --> 00:44:50,163
Yeah, which one? The
one about the...

849
00:44:50,234 --> 00:44:52,532
Karma. About how things
come back to you.

850
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:53,894
That one, it was tight.

851
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:56,904
For real? Thanks. Yeah.

852
00:44:57,775 --> 00:44:59,265
I wasn't gonna say anything, but...

853
00:44:59,543 --> 00:45:00,874
I liked yours, too.

854
00:45:00,945 --> 00:45:02,207
Why?

855
00:45:02,279 --> 00:45:03,405
Why wasn't I gonna say anything,

856
00:45:03,514 --> 00:45:05,778
or why did I like it? No,
why did you like it?

857
00:45:05,883 --> 00:45:08,875
I don't know, it just...
It felt real.

858
00:45:11,455 --> 00:45:12,786
Okay.

859
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:16,115
Didn't you have a different
shirt on earlier?

860
00:45:16,227 --> 00:45:17,353
What?

861
00:45:17,428 --> 00:45:18,759
Nothin'.

862
00:45:19,096 --> 00:45:21,724
No, say what you're
gonna say. Nothin'.

863
00:45:25,436 --> 00:45:27,461
Yeah, I had on a different shirt.

864
00:45:27,571 --> 00:45:28,970
That's cool.

865
00:45:30,908 --> 00:45:32,773
So how come you weren't going
to say anything about it?

866
00:45:33,277 --> 00:45:34,904
About your shirt? About the poem.

867
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,809
'Cause you're moody. Moody?

868
00:45:37,915 --> 00:45:40,076
And quiet. I'm not moody!

869
00:45:40,151 --> 00:45:41,709
Yeah, right!

870
00:45:45,656 --> 00:45:47,248
What? This is me.

871
00:45:47,925 --> 00:45:51,156
Hey, it's not so bad when there's
a little conversation!

872
00:45:51,262 --> 00:45:52,593
You wanna come up?

873
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,970
Who gave you this?

874
00:46:11,082 --> 00:46:13,346
The bear? My dad. No, this.

875
00:46:15,753 --> 00:46:17,744
Girl, my stupid ex-boyfriend
gave me that.

876
00:46:17,822 --> 00:46:19,289
Oh, cute.

877
00:46:20,024 --> 00:46:22,788
Not really. But I guess
it was at the time.

878
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:28,030
So this is the artist I
was telling you about.

879
00:46:28,132 --> 00:46:30,362
Her stuff is like...
I don't know, dense.

880
00:46:32,403 --> 00:46:34,496
Yeah, this is straight.
You burn me a copy?

881
00:46:34,572 --> 00:46:36,005
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Good. Thanks.

882
00:46:36,073 --> 00:46:38,405
I got some other stuff
for you, too.

883
00:46:38,509 --> 00:46:39,635
Cool.

884
00:46:42,813 --> 00:46:43,837
So who do you hang out with?

885
00:46:43,914 --> 00:46:46,712
'Cause I never really
see you with anybody.

886
00:46:50,821 --> 00:46:52,550
I'm sorry. I didn't mean for
it to come out like that.

887
00:46:52,656 --> 00:46:53,918
I was just curious 'cause

888
00:46:54,325 --> 00:46:55,883
I don't really like anybody
that goes there either.

889
00:46:57,561 --> 00:46:59,188
No, my, my friend Laura
used to go there.

890
00:46:59,263 --> 00:47:01,493
Not now, but she's coming back.

891
00:47:01,565 --> 00:47:02,691
Cool.

892
00:47:02,766 --> 00:47:04,734
'Cause I was gonna say, I'm
going to this house party

893
00:47:04,835 --> 00:47:06,826
and, you know, you can
come if you want to.

894
00:47:07,171 --> 00:47:08,763
They play like this kind of music.

895
00:47:12,543 --> 00:47:13,669
Sure.

896
00:47:13,844 --> 00:47:15,778
How am I supposed to dress?

897
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,178
You don't gotta dress,
you just come however.

898
00:47:18,249 --> 00:47:20,080
Come as you are.

899
00:47:20,551 --> 00:47:21,677
Okay.

900
00:47:24,121 --> 00:47:25,452
Can I see?

901
00:47:26,357 --> 00:47:28,791
It's... It's mostly
old stuff, though.

902
00:47:30,127 --> 00:47:32,925
Oh, this is the one that
you did earlier.

903
00:47:32,997 --> 00:47:34,259
Yeah. Yeah.

904
00:47:35,799 --> 00:47:37,130
It's nice.

905
00:47:43,374 --> 00:47:44,432
Here you go.

906
00:47:46,777 --> 00:47:49,211
Take it. You play too much!

907
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,578
Just take it. Thank you.

908
00:47:51,949 --> 00:47:53,473
You're welcome.

909
00:47:56,287 --> 00:47:57,982
So, what's so private?

910
00:47:58,255 --> 00:48:00,450
Nothing. It's just my writings.

911
00:48:24,748 --> 00:48:26,181
Why'd you do that for?

912
00:48:26,617 --> 00:48:28,016
I'm sorry.

913
00:48:29,019 --> 00:48:30,509
I thought... No, I'm sorry,

914
00:48:31,622 --> 00:48:33,180
I just gotta go.

915
00:48:34,692 --> 00:48:36,182
But I thought that...

916
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,691
I'm sorry.

917
00:48:38,662 --> 00:48:40,357
We gonna get y'all on the
board, God damn it!

918
00:48:40,698 --> 00:48:41,790
Okay.

919
00:48:41,865 --> 00:48:43,799
Let's play, keep it rolling,
keep it rolling!

920
00:48:43,867 --> 00:48:45,095
Ain't giving you
no stupid-ass hand.

921
00:48:45,169 --> 00:48:46,761
You
gonna get that?

922
00:48:46,837 --> 00:48:48,600
Yeah, I got it. There
you go. Cut that!

923
00:48:50,808 --> 00:48:52,298
Come on, bring it out,
bring it out.

924
00:48:52,376 --> 00:48:53,638
Ooh!

925
00:48:54,011 --> 00:48:55,842
We went in the hole one time.

926
00:48:55,946 --> 00:48:57,538
Y'all went in the
hole twice! Yo, wassup.

927
00:48:58,382 --> 00:49:00,543
Yo, whaddup, Lee!
Yo, what you got, Ty?

928
00:49:00,818 --> 00:49:02,308
Pick 'em up! Nasty!

929
00:49:05,556 --> 00:49:08,286
Oh! We goin' to eight!
We goin' to eight!

930
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,025
Uh, can I talk to you for a second?

931
00:49:11,161 --> 00:49:13,254
Yo, I'm busy right now,
I'm doing something.

932
00:49:13,897 --> 00:49:17,230
Holdup, holdup! That was
my jack! I cut! I cut!

933
00:49:18,902 --> 00:49:20,733
Laura, I really need
to talk to you.

934
00:49:21,372 --> 00:49:22,737
Laura, I really need... Yo, man.

935
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,933
I told you I'm fucking busy! Shit!

936
00:49:26,076 --> 00:49:28,840
Nah. Nah, nah. I'm busy.

937
00:49:35,052 --> 00:49:36,713
Goodnight. GIRL
2: Get home safe!

938
00:49:36,787 --> 00:49:38,914
Yo... I thought that was your girl.

939
00:49:39,056 --> 00:49:40,614
Mind yo business! I'm her girl!

940
00:49:40,724 --> 00:49:42,282
Exactly. Exactly. This will...

941
00:49:42,459 --> 00:49:45,622
You go ahead. That's what
I'm talking about.

942
00:49:45,729 --> 00:49:46,855
Y'all niggas don't know.

943
00:49:47,431 --> 00:49:50,195
You know, boo. Get the
fuck outta here, yo!

944
00:50:04,481 --> 00:50:05,573
Dad!

945
00:50:11,255 --> 00:50:13,382
Come on, now, you know that's
not what I want.

946
00:50:14,625 --> 00:50:16,217
That's not what I'm saying!

947
00:50:17,094 --> 00:50:19,961
Lis... Listen to me. Are you
going to listen to me?

948
00:50:20,264 --> 00:50:21,288
Dad?

949
00:50:22,966 --> 00:50:24,661
Listen, I gotta go.

950
00:50:24,768 --> 00:50:27,566
I gotta go, my daughter's...
My daughter's up!

951
00:50:27,638 --> 00:50:29,401
Dad? Talk to you later, bye.

952
00:50:29,973 --> 00:50:32,237
Who was that? What you doing up?

953
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:35,073
Just wanted to talk.

954
00:50:41,118 --> 00:50:42,449
Dad, the plate!

955
00:50:43,187 --> 00:50:45,087
Don't trash the plate.

956
00:50:46,156 --> 00:50:47,987
Aren't you hungry? No.

957
00:50:48,492 --> 00:50:50,619
Ate already. You ate at work?

958
00:50:50,994 --> 00:50:52,985
Grabbed some takeout. Oh, where?

959
00:50:54,164 --> 00:50:55,688
Why you asking me so many
goddamn questions, girl?

960
00:50:55,799 --> 00:50:57,824
What's wrong with you?
You don't question me.

961
00:50:59,636 --> 00:51:00,796
Sorry.

962
00:51:02,373 --> 00:51:03,772
Hold up, Alike.

963
00:51:05,008 --> 00:51:07,135
Come on back. Look.

964
00:51:07,277 --> 00:51:08,471
I got patties.

965
00:51:10,948 --> 00:51:12,939
Beef? And chicken. Come on.

966
00:51:20,858 --> 00:51:22,325
Listen, um...

967
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,555
Your mom was worried that uh...

968
00:51:31,301 --> 00:51:33,565
She's been wanting me to ask you,

969
00:51:34,171 --> 00:51:35,536
that, uh...

970
00:51:38,809 --> 00:51:40,367
How's school?

971
00:51:40,544 --> 00:51:42,034
Straight As?

972
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,738
Probably.

973
00:51:45,149 --> 00:51:47,549
That's right. Wanna sip?

974
00:51:51,488 --> 00:51:53,217
I said a sip! A sip!

975
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:01,188
What's on your mind?

976
00:52:02,966 --> 00:52:04,228
Nothin'.

977
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:10,570
What if...

978
00:52:11,642 --> 00:52:15,373
What if say... Somebody liked you?

979
00:52:15,913 --> 00:52:18,040
They like you? Or they
"like you" like you?

980
00:52:18,148 --> 00:52:19,809
They "like you" like you.

981
00:52:20,083 --> 00:52:21,243
Uh-huh.

982
00:52:22,586 --> 00:52:24,816
They haven't said anything
yet but...

983
00:52:24,922 --> 00:52:27,755
But what if... All right,
what if the person

984
00:52:28,058 --> 00:52:29,992
is kind of like a friend,

985
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,955
but you know they like
you more than that?

986
00:52:32,396 --> 00:52:35,092
Well, I think that's the best
way, to start as friends.

987
00:52:38,268 --> 00:52:41,431
What if... What if the person is...

988
00:52:43,474 --> 00:52:45,101
What if the person...
What's his name?

989
00:52:45,175 --> 00:52:47,735
What grade is he in? I'm gonna
look his ass up in the system.

990
00:52:48,979 --> 00:52:50,469
Wait till I tell your mama.

991
00:52:50,581 --> 00:52:52,105
She'll be so goddamn happy.

992
00:52:55,118 --> 00:52:56,176
Yeah.

993
00:53:02,192 --> 00:53:03,591
Say, uh...

994
00:53:04,194 --> 00:53:07,254
There's this new, uh, women's club

995
00:53:08,131 --> 00:53:10,326
up there by the liquor store.

996
00:53:11,835 --> 00:53:12,927
Do you...

997
00:53:13,871 --> 00:53:17,307
Have you... You haven't heard
anything about it, right?

998
00:53:18,108 --> 00:53:21,475
Called the Kitty Litter, Cat
Box, something like that?

999
00:53:23,146 --> 00:53:25,307
Nah, never even heard of it.

1000
00:53:26,116 --> 00:53:27,140
Good.

1001
00:53:27,651 --> 00:53:28,845
'Cause it's a...

1002
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,451
That's a rough neighborhood.

1003
00:53:31,655 --> 00:53:33,714
You know that, right? I
had a case over there.

1004
00:53:34,525 --> 00:53:36,322
You wanna be careful.

1005
00:53:36,627 --> 00:53:38,288
Stay away from that element.

1006
00:53:38,395 --> 00:53:40,386
In case it ever comes up.

1007
00:53:41,164 --> 00:53:42,392
I'll be careful.

1008
00:53:42,499 --> 00:53:43,557
Good.

1009
00:53:44,001 --> 00:53:45,559
I know you will.

1010
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,569
Dad, when you were on
the phone earlier...

1011
00:53:51,675 --> 00:53:53,165
Uh-huh. It sounded like...

1012
00:53:55,045 --> 00:53:56,137
I mean...

1013
00:53:57,014 --> 00:53:59,175
I guess you're headed
back to work, huh?

1014
00:53:59,316 --> 00:54:00,408
Yup.

1015
00:54:01,885 --> 00:54:04,183
Your mama still up? Probably.

1016
00:54:05,689 --> 00:54:07,020
Tell her I had to work.

1017
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,725
Love you.

1018
00:54:40,857 --> 00:54:42,119
Hey. Hey.

1019
00:54:44,928 --> 00:54:46,725
I'm real sorry about the other day.

1020
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:51,566
It's cool. Things have been crazy.

1021
00:54:52,569 --> 00:54:54,594
But look, I'm really
sorry I bugged out.

1022
00:54:54,671 --> 00:54:58,004
It's just, I didn't know that you...
I wasn't expecting that.

1023
00:54:59,309 --> 00:55:01,607
First kiss?

1024
00:55:02,779 --> 00:55:03,939
It's cool.

1025
00:55:05,682 --> 00:55:07,582
You still comin' to the party?

1026
00:55:07,684 --> 00:55:11,120
Um... I don't know. I need to
try to catch up with Laura.

1027
00:55:12,422 --> 00:55:13,480
Oh, okay.

1028
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:17,319
No, but I do wanna hang, but I
mean, maybe we could do both.

1029
00:55:17,527 --> 00:55:18,687
Cool.

1030
00:55:20,764 --> 00:55:23,198
Uh, do you want to spend the night?

1031
00:55:24,635 --> 00:55:27,195
You know, maybe avoid that
whole curfew thing?

1032
00:56:10,213 --> 00:56:11,805
Oh, you're home?

1033
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:14,242
Hey.

1034
00:56:15,752 --> 00:56:17,652
I must have dozed off.

1035
00:56:18,422 --> 00:56:20,413
How long you been in? Hour.

1036
00:56:22,526 --> 00:56:23,891
Did you see the plate over there?

1037
00:56:24,661 --> 00:56:26,094
This is fine.

1038
00:56:28,732 --> 00:56:30,393
Why don't you come sit over
here? There's room.

1039
00:56:30,534 --> 00:56:33,264
You could see the TV better.
This is fine.

1040
00:56:34,037 --> 00:56:35,334
Thank you.

1041
00:56:37,107 --> 00:56:38,199
Just alike.

1042
00:56:38,275 --> 00:56:39,572
Say what?

1043
00:56:39,776 --> 00:56:42,870
You and your daughter. Did
you talk to Lee yet?

1044
00:56:43,346 --> 00:56:46,213
I told you she's still...
I talked to Alike.

1045
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:48,278
You did?

1046
00:56:48,385 --> 00:56:50,785
Everything's fine, like I told you.

1047
00:56:51,054 --> 00:56:53,352
Matter of fact, she's
got a boyfriend.

1048
00:56:54,191 --> 00:56:56,785
A boyfriend? Just give
her some space.

1049
00:56:57,227 --> 00:56:58,353
Space?

1050
00:56:59,362 --> 00:57:02,195
She's never around as it is.
And you're just like her!

1051
00:57:02,733 --> 00:57:04,291
Creeping in all hours of the night.

1052
00:57:04,401 --> 00:57:06,130
Running around like you
got something to hide.

1053
00:57:06,236 --> 00:57:07,294
Both of you!

1054
00:57:07,404 --> 00:57:09,872
And acting like I'm
the big bad witch!

1055
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:11,066
What about me, huh?

1056
00:57:11,141 --> 00:57:13,405
I'm here alone by myself
all the time.

1057
00:57:13,477 --> 00:57:15,741
And Sharonda's getting older and
she's starting to go out,

1058
00:57:15,812 --> 00:57:18,042
and pretty soon... I don't
have anything to hide.

1059
00:57:18,648 --> 00:57:21,082
Look, I told you, I
talked to Alike.

1060
00:57:21,718 --> 00:57:23,379
Everything's fine. Did you ask her?

1061
00:57:23,453 --> 00:57:25,546
No, because I don't have to.

1062
00:57:26,957 --> 00:57:28,822
Besides, I would know, okay?

1063
00:57:28,925 --> 00:57:30,916
I know my daughter better than anyone
else. "Your daughter."

1064
00:57:30,994 --> 00:57:32,720
So all of a sudden now she's
your daughter? And I'm

1065
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:33,588
telling you, she's fine.

1066
00:57:33,663 --> 00:57:35,654
Well, I guess then I just shouldn't
say anything else about this!

1067
00:57:35,732 --> 00:57:37,825
That's your damn problem. You're
too much of a damn worrywart.

1068
00:57:37,934 --> 00:57:39,333
Well, let's hope you're
right, detective.

1069
00:57:39,436 --> 00:57:41,427
Will you shut the fuck up?

1070
00:57:42,472 --> 00:57:44,167
An hour? Really?

1071
00:57:44,641 --> 00:57:46,632
I'm not your damn dumb
floozy on the street

1072
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:48,678
and you will not talk
to me like that!

1073
00:57:49,513 --> 00:57:51,276
Dammit, Audrey,
you're making a scene!

1074
00:57:51,515 --> 00:57:53,278
I'm not making a scene. You're
the one making a scene!

1075
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:55,511
You're all paranoid and sick!
You're never here!

1076
00:58:09,699 --> 00:58:11,690
I know you're not scared.

1077
00:58:12,469 --> 00:58:13,697
I'm not.

1078
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:22,002
Lee... Hmm?

1079
00:58:23,747 --> 00:58:26,375
I hope you know it doesn't
matter to me.

1080
00:58:30,854 --> 00:58:32,048
I know.

1081
00:58:50,507 --> 00:58:52,498
And she ran like blood

1082
00:58:54,177 --> 00:58:58,511
Through the corridors of your mind

1083
00:58:59,349 --> 00:59:01,374
Into a brand new future

1084
00:59:03,253 --> 00:59:08,714
One without the likes of you

1085
00:59:49,099 --> 00:59:51,294
You are mad fun to hang
out with, I have to say.

1086
00:59:54,104 --> 00:59:56,402
- Are you serious?
- Yeah!

1087
00:59:56,473 --> 00:59:57,770
Whatever!

1088
00:59:57,974 --> 00:59:59,839
I'm just playing. About...
About six months ago.

1089
01:00:02,479 --> 01:00:04,413
What's good? What's up?

1090
01:00:04,514 --> 01:00:06,277
How you doing? Good.

1091
01:00:09,319 --> 01:00:11,981
So what do you think?
She's cool, right?

1092
01:00:13,657 --> 01:00:15,488
She's hot, right? I told you!

1093
01:00:15,659 --> 01:00:18,025
Right? I told you! It was
so... Yo, I'm right here.

1094
01:00:19,763 --> 01:00:20,821
Oh, my bad!

1095
01:00:20,931 --> 01:00:22,091
I thought you were right beside me.

1096
01:00:22,165 --> 01:00:24,133
No. Anyway, I was thinking
next weekend,

1097
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,169
the three of us, we could,
you know, go out.

1098
01:00:27,504 --> 01:00:29,734
I'm sorry about all the drama.

1099
01:00:30,206 --> 01:00:32,674
Nah, it's cool. I mean,
I should have... No.

1100
01:00:33,176 --> 01:00:34,871
You know. What I'm saying is,

1101
01:00:35,412 --> 01:00:37,846
I probably overreacted. I mean...

1102
01:00:39,516 --> 01:00:42,349
But then, I don't know, seeing
the two of you together...

1103
01:00:44,354 --> 01:00:46,322
I'm glad you're finally
happy though.

1104
01:00:48,391 --> 01:00:51,155
Come on, man, you know
you're my best friend.

1105
01:00:51,227 --> 01:00:53,991
I'm not, no one's ever... You don't
have to say anything, yo.

1106
01:00:54,064 --> 01:00:57,158
I just want to get this off
my chest, all right?

1107
01:00:57,567 --> 01:00:59,694
I'm glad she makes you happy.

1108
01:01:00,003 --> 01:01:01,664
I'm happy for you.

1109
01:01:03,206 --> 01:01:04,400
A'ight?

1110
01:01:05,542 --> 01:01:07,169
'Cause I love you.

1111
01:01:15,452 --> 01:01:16,851
Hey. Hey!

1112
01:01:17,187 --> 01:01:19,417
- Come on, let's get
- So...

1113
01:01:19,756 --> 01:01:21,189
Wait! Laura.

1114
01:01:23,093 --> 01:01:25,584
Come on, let's go, I
know some... Laura!

1115
01:01:25,695 --> 01:01:27,424
What up, boo?

1116
01:01:28,865 --> 01:01:30,196
Come on, let's go.

1117
01:01:37,374 --> 01:01:39,706
I'm not sleeping. Yes, you are.

1118
01:01:41,544 --> 01:01:42,875
Are there any more brownies left?

1119
01:01:43,613 --> 01:01:44,739
Nope.

1120
01:01:51,554 --> 01:01:53,715
What? Nothing.

1121
01:01:58,495 --> 01:02:00,395
What? Nothing!

1122
01:02:45,341 --> 01:02:47,036
What's wrong?

1123
01:02:52,048 --> 01:02:53,106
This is...

1124
01:02:55,785 --> 01:02:57,116
I never...

1125
01:02:59,389 --> 01:03:01,289
I'm sorry, I'm trippin'.

1126
01:03:03,059 --> 01:03:04,287
It's okay.

1127
01:03:05,462 --> 01:03:07,123
We don't have to.

1128
01:05:04,881 --> 01:05:05,939
Oh.

1129
01:05:09,352 --> 01:05:11,718
I thought you went
out for something.

1130
01:05:13,056 --> 01:05:14,523
How you been?

1131
01:05:17,994 --> 01:05:20,554
You know me and Candy
doing real good.

1132
01:05:21,464 --> 01:05:23,796
We might even get a bigger place.

1133
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:26,397
She workin' at the hospital now.

1134
01:05:26,502 --> 01:05:27,560
You'd be real proud.

1135
01:05:29,205 --> 01:05:31,173
She might even get her RN.

1136
01:05:32,075 --> 01:05:33,838
How's... How's pops?

1137
01:05:36,379 --> 01:05:38,540
You look good. You look real good.

1138
01:05:41,584 --> 01:05:44,052
You know, we miss you
and everything.

1139
01:05:44,153 --> 01:05:46,417
I don't, I don't want to take
too much of your time

1140
01:05:46,522 --> 01:05:48,547
or anything like that. I just...

1141
01:05:48,725 --> 01:05:51,250
I got my... I'm getting
my stuff together, too.

1142
01:05:51,394 --> 01:05:52,486
You know?

1143
01:05:53,229 --> 01:05:54,594
So I did it.

1144
01:05:56,032 --> 01:05:57,499
I got my GED.

1145
01:05:59,102 --> 01:06:01,536
Nah, nah, I did it! I got my GED!

1146
01:06:22,091 --> 01:06:23,786
Good morning. Hey.

1147
01:06:26,262 --> 01:06:27,923
You're up already.

1148
01:06:28,564 --> 01:06:29,792
Actually, it's after one o'clock.

1149
01:06:35,438 --> 01:06:36,905
What's wrong? Nothing.

1150
01:06:37,307 --> 01:06:38,774
I'm just trying to clean
up, that's all.

1151
01:06:39,442 --> 01:06:41,740
Okay, let me help you then. No,
it's all right, I got it.

1152
01:06:44,047 --> 01:06:45,810
What's wrong? Nothing!

1153
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:53,213
Look, um, last night was...

1154
01:06:54,757 --> 01:06:56,725
It was amazing, and thank you.

1155
01:06:58,161 --> 01:07:00,493
Last night was just playing
around, all right?

1156
01:07:04,801 --> 01:07:06,166
Look, we can slow things down.

1157
01:07:06,269 --> 01:07:08,294
People don't have to know
that we're together.

1158
01:07:09,472 --> 01:07:11,599
Together? Whoa.

1159
01:07:12,775 --> 01:07:14,106
No, uh-uh.

1160
01:07:15,945 --> 01:07:17,913
Look, if you don't want to
call it that, that's fine,

1161
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:19,675
but don't act like
nothing happened.

1162
01:07:19,782 --> 01:07:22,250
I'm not like "gay"
gay, I'm just...

1163
01:07:25,421 --> 01:07:26,513
I'm just...

1164
01:07:26,789 --> 01:07:28,620
You know, I'm just doing
my thing, that's all.

1165
01:07:29,659 --> 01:07:32,628
I'm just, I'm not ready
for all of this, okay?

1166
01:07:32,795 --> 01:07:34,126
Excuse me.

1167
01:08:01,057 --> 01:08:02,991
Hey, Lee, Lee! Hold up.

1168
01:08:04,394 --> 01:08:05,520
What?

1169
01:08:06,829 --> 01:08:09,354
You don't have to tell
anybody, okay?

1170
01:08:42,765 --> 01:08:44,756
Where in the hell have you been?

1171
01:08:45,168 --> 01:08:46,533
You hear me talking to you?

1172
01:08:47,036 --> 01:08:49,664
You left Bina hours
ago! I am not Dad!

1173
01:08:49,872 --> 01:08:52,670
I'm not your husband, so stop
coming at me like I am!

1174
01:08:53,209 --> 01:08:55,575
I'm not your companion and
I'm not your friend!

1175
01:08:55,678 --> 01:08:57,873
You made that abundantly clear!

1176
01:08:58,181 --> 01:09:01,173
I'm your daughter! And I have
my own shit to deal with!

1177
01:09:01,551 --> 01:09:03,416
You must have lost your damn mind!

1178
01:09:03,486 --> 01:09:05,920
You wait till your
father gets home!

1179
01:09:41,524 --> 01:09:43,617
I would be something
else if it wasn't for you!

1180
01:09:43,693 --> 01:09:46,628
I'd be a lawyer maybe! AUDREY: Oh,
you wouldn't be shit because

1181
01:09:46,696 --> 01:09:48,755
I made you! I made you!

1182
01:09:48,831 --> 01:09:49,923
You couldn't even get a damn B...

1183
01:09:49,999 --> 01:09:51,193
Always thinking about yourself!

1184
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:53,097
...on a test until I helped
you! We'd have more money!

1185
01:09:53,169 --> 01:09:55,467
We'd have a damn brownstone instead
of living in the basement of one!

1186
01:09:55,538 --> 01:09:57,506
You the one who's making a scene!
Doing all this paranoid shit!

1187
01:09:57,607 --> 01:09:58,631
You're never here!
I'm not paranoid.

1188
01:09:58,708 --> 01:09:59,800
I can't take this shit anymore!

1189
01:09:59,876 --> 01:10:00,968
Will you stop saying that!

1190
01:10:01,043 --> 01:10:03,034
It's the truth! Audrey, stop it!

1191
01:10:03,546 --> 01:10:05,446
Alike, go back to bed.

1192
01:10:05,681 --> 01:10:07,114
You have a slut on the side!
Nothing's going on!

1193
01:10:07,183 --> 01:10:08,309
I'm not paranoid! I'm not paranoid!

1194
01:10:08,384 --> 01:10:09,612
I can't take this shit anymore!
You are paranoid!

1195
01:10:09,685 --> 01:10:11,243
Alike, baby, go back to your room!

1196
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:13,185
Lee, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no. ALIKE: Go upstairs.

1197
01:10:13,256 --> 01:10:14,746
Don't leave me, please! No, No!

1198
01:10:14,824 --> 01:10:16,815
Go in my room and lock the door.
Keep me company, please?

1199
01:10:18,461 --> 01:10:20,486
Do not come out the room!

1200
01:10:20,563 --> 01:10:22,861
Go upstairs in my room and
lock the door. Please!

1201
01:10:22,999 --> 01:10:24,023
I'm not paranoid!

1202
01:10:24,133 --> 01:10:25,657
You are paranoid! All
you do is break!

1203
01:10:25,735 --> 01:10:27,794
All you do is break!
When do I see you?

1204
01:10:28,137 --> 01:10:30,071
When do the kids see you? I just
need to get outta here!

1205
01:10:30,172 --> 01:10:31,537
You don't want to face the facts!

1206
01:10:31,641 --> 01:10:33,506
You don't wanna face the facts!
No dammit, that's not true!

1207
01:10:33,743 --> 01:10:35,040
It is true! Look, would
you stop saying that?

1208
01:10:35,177 --> 01:10:36,701
It is true! Audrey, stop it!

1209
01:10:36,812 --> 01:10:38,370
Alike go back to bed.

1210
01:10:38,481 --> 01:10:40,574
Your daughter is turning into a
damn man right before your eyes

1211
01:10:40,683 --> 01:10:42,344
and you can't even see it!
No, you take that back!

1212
01:10:42,418 --> 01:10:44,852
Shut the fuck up about that, Audrey!
Mom, Dad, stop! Please!

1213
01:10:44,921 --> 01:10:46,081
Tell him!

1214
01:10:46,188 --> 01:10:47,587
Tell him where you hang out!

1215
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:50,020
Tell him about your butch-ass
girlfriend! Laura is not my girlfriend!

1216
01:10:50,092 --> 01:10:51,252
What the hell are you
talking about?

1217
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,328
Alike, please, just go back
to your room, baby.

1218
01:10:53,396 --> 01:10:54,920
Tell him! Tell him! Tell me what?

1219
01:10:55,064 --> 01:10:57,555
Tell him you're a nasty
ass dyke! No! No! No!

1220
01:10:57,667 --> 01:11:00,568
Alike, you tell your mama
that's not true!

1221
01:11:02,738 --> 01:11:04,069
Baby, tell her!

1222
01:11:05,942 --> 01:11:07,603
You see! You see! Will
you shut the hell up?

1223
01:11:07,877 --> 01:11:09,344
You tell her. Dad.

1224
01:11:10,279 --> 01:11:12,042
You tell your mother
that's not true.

1225
01:11:12,582 --> 01:11:14,243
You already know. No, I don't know.

1226
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:17,217
You tell your mama it's just
a phase. It's not a phase!

1227
01:11:17,386 --> 01:11:18,910
See, you should
have done something!

1228
01:11:18,988 --> 01:11:20,387
You should have done something!
What's wrong with you?

1229
01:11:20,456 --> 01:11:21,855
There's nothing wrong with
me! This is your fault!

1230
01:11:21,924 --> 01:11:23,755
Shut the hell up! Lemme talk!
If you had been here!

1231
01:11:23,859 --> 01:11:25,918
Yeah. I'm gay!

1232
01:11:27,096 --> 01:11:29,087
You say it again. Say it again!

1233
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:32,065
I'm a lesbian! Yeah, I'm
a dyke! Audrey! Audrey!

1234
01:11:32,134 --> 01:11:33,362
Get off! Get off!

1235
01:11:37,974 --> 01:11:40,636
Audrey! No, you're not!
You get off of me!

1236
01:11:40,810 --> 01:11:42,869
Come on! You cheater!
You get off me!

1237
01:11:42,979 --> 01:11:44,469
Get off of me! ARTHUR:
Come on, we gotta go!

1238
01:14:07,423 --> 01:14:08,685
Okay.

1239
01:14:09,592 --> 01:14:10,684
Okay.

1240
01:14:24,039 --> 01:14:26,132
Would you care to say grace?

1241
01:14:30,579 --> 01:14:32,240
Heavenly Father,

1242
01:14:33,082 --> 01:14:35,880
we thank you for this food.

1243
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:39,153
We pray for your continued
blessing.

1244
01:14:41,257 --> 01:14:42,588
We pray...

1245
01:14:45,628 --> 01:14:47,220
We thank... Amen.

1246
01:14:47,663 --> 01:14:49,392
Amen. This food should
be delicious.

1247
01:14:49,465 --> 01:14:51,592
I got the recipe from a magazine.

1248
01:14:51,667 --> 01:14:54,227
And I made your green beans
that you like so much.

1249
01:14:54,303 --> 01:14:56,794
Sharonda, could you pass
me the green beans?

1250
01:15:00,075 --> 01:15:01,565
This is yummy.

1251
01:15:04,346 --> 01:15:06,405
Dad, you know where she is.

1252
01:15:31,941 --> 01:15:33,499
Yo, Lee.

1253
01:16:01,704 --> 01:16:03,069
Where's Mom?

1254
01:16:04,773 --> 01:16:06,001
She...

1255
01:16:07,076 --> 01:16:09,237
Your mother couldn't make it.

1256
01:16:15,584 --> 01:16:17,176
You remember our old place?

1257
01:16:17,253 --> 01:16:18,914
Way out in Queens?

1258
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:24,559
It was our first apartment.
We were so proud.

1259
01:16:25,761 --> 01:16:27,729
It had all those trees around it.

1260
01:16:27,796 --> 01:16:30,697
In October, the whole block would
be covered with leaves.

1261
01:16:30,766 --> 01:16:32,199
You remember?

1262
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:37,803
Couldn't have been more
than two years old.

1263
01:16:38,374 --> 01:16:40,137
When that wind would blow,

1264
01:16:40,409 --> 01:16:42,240
those leaves would come rushing
down the street at us.

1265
01:16:42,311 --> 01:16:44,438
You thought they were alive.

1266
01:16:46,282 --> 01:16:48,079
You'd get so scared.

1267
01:16:48,884 --> 01:16:51,785
You'd cry and scream and beg
for us to pick you up.

1268
01:16:55,124 --> 01:16:57,718
I would try and tell you, "They're
only leaves, baby,"

1269
01:16:57,793 --> 01:16:59,283
and make you stay on the ground,

1270
01:17:00,829 --> 01:17:03,593
but your mother would
always pick you up.

1271
01:17:06,602 --> 01:17:08,593
She always picked you up.

1272
01:17:14,944 --> 01:17:17,412
Remember how we used to race
to the phone when it rang?

1273
01:17:17,479 --> 01:17:20,744
I've been accepted into an
early college program.

1274
01:17:21,283 --> 01:17:23,478
It starts in the spring.
It's in Berkeley.

1275
01:17:24,853 --> 01:17:27,185
It's a 10-week writing workshop.

1276
01:17:27,623 --> 01:17:31,616
Boot camp, then I could
start summer semester.

1277
01:17:33,329 --> 01:17:35,490
We can talk about that, okay?

1278
01:17:36,265 --> 01:17:37,596
I need you to meet with
my guidance counselor,

1279
01:17:37,666 --> 01:17:40,635
so you could sign the paperwork,
so I can graduate early.

1280
01:17:41,837 --> 01:17:43,668
I'm sorry, all right?

1281
01:17:44,807 --> 01:17:46,297
I'm sorry I let her hurt you.

1282
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:48,343
I just need to know if you'll sign
the paperwork. Yes or no?

1283
01:17:48,444 --> 01:17:50,309
Can you forgive me? Yes or no?

1284
01:17:52,147 --> 01:17:54,377
You can always come back home.

1285
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:55,910
Things are going to be different,
I promise you.

1286
01:17:55,985 --> 01:17:57,179
Dad...

1287
01:17:59,321 --> 01:18:00,948
I'm not runnin'.

1288
01:18:02,324 --> 01:18:03,814
I'm choosin'.

1289
01:18:08,197 --> 01:18:10,165
I'm not going back home.

1290
01:18:15,838 --> 01:18:16,998
I know.

1291
01:18:23,345 --> 01:18:25,870
And you could tell
Mom she was right.

1292
01:18:27,249 --> 01:18:29,308
God doesn't make mistakes.

1293
01:18:29,685 --> 01:18:31,846
You should tell her yourself.

1294
01:18:45,034 --> 01:18:46,399
Mom.

1295
01:18:52,207 --> 01:18:53,265
Lee.

1296
01:18:54,510 --> 01:18:55,670
Alike.

1297
01:18:57,346 --> 01:18:59,007
How have you been?

1298
01:19:00,249 --> 01:19:01,375
Fine.

1299
01:19:02,451 --> 01:19:04,180
Did Dad tell you?

1300
01:19:05,687 --> 01:19:07,348
Yeah. He told me.

1301
01:19:10,893 --> 01:19:12,383
How you been?

1302
01:19:15,064 --> 01:19:17,692
I sure hope you've been
keeping yourself safe.

1303
01:19:29,778 --> 01:19:31,370
I love you, Mom.

1304
01:19:43,258 --> 01:19:44,919
I said I love you.

1305
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,832
I'll be praying for you.

1306
01:20:11,353 --> 01:20:14,288
"Heartbreak opens
onto the sunrise

1307
01:20:17,126 --> 01:20:19,651
