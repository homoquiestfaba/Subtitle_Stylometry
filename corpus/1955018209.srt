01:51:38,775 --> 01:51:41,862
Yeah, but he's happy right now.

1370
01:51:42,196 --> 01:51:44,156
As long as someone's paying for the system.

1371
01:51:44,239 --> 01:51:46,366
There's 50 commissions right there.
That'll take care of his heart,

1372
01:51:46,450 --> 01:51:49,286
that'll take care of the down payment
on the M.5.

1373
01:51:49,369 --> 01:51:52,122
The Union can dock my pay for the rest.

1374
01:51:52,623 --> 01:51:54,124
Hey, sir. Sir!

1375
01:51:55,042 --> 01:51:56,668
This one's still alive.

1376
01:51:56,752 --> 01:51:59,171
Leave her. I'll take care of her.

1377
01:51:59,838 --> 01:52:00,923
Hold.

1378
01:52:08,555 --> 01:52:10,349
Sweet dreams, buddy.

1379
01:52:13,769 --> 01:52:17,814
For extensive neurological injuries,
I'd have to recommend the M.5 Neural Net.

1380
01:52:18,690 --> 01:52:23,528
<i>We're running a special on it this month,
18% for the first year, 24% after that.</i>

1381
01:52:24,238 --> 01:52:28,033
Why should your loved one pass on just
because of a little brain damage?

1382
01:52:28,116 --> 01:52:29,618
That's barbaric.

1383
01:52:29,701 --> 01:52:32,037
<i>That's just bad science.</i>

1384
01:52:32,371 --> 01:52:33,497
(STIFLES SOB)

1385
01:52:33,956 --> 01:52:39,002
<i>With the M.5 Neural Net,
yesterday's dreams are today's reality.</i>

1386
01:52:43,632 --> 01:52:46,635
<i>Imagine your loved ones
living out the rest of their natural lives</i>

1387
01:52:46,718 --> 01:52:50,264
<i>in a world where they are always happy,
always content,</i>

1388
01:52:50,889 --> 01:52:52,891
<i>and always taken care of.</i>

1389
01:52:55,519 --> 01:52:58,855
You owe it to your family.
You owe it to yourself.

1390
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:02,150
A little fruit for the fruit?

1391
01:53:06,113 --> 01:53:07,364
Why not?

1392
01:53:08,156 --> 01:53:09,449
Cheers.

1393
01:53:18,083 --> 01:53:19,209
