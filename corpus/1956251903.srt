1
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,628
<i>There. You see him?
Vig's there. Right there.</i>

2
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,839
<i>Stop the car.
Stop the fucking car.</i>

3
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:54,387
Cody!

4
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:56,722
Hey!

5
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,849
Come on. Cody.

6
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,060
Cody, come on!

7
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,146
Hey, hey!

8
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,607
Cody!

9
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:12,613
Hey!

10
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:13,614
Freeze!

11
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:15,951
Motherfucker!

12
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,182
No, fuck!

13
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,354
Cody, Cody?

14
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,699
Oh, fuck.

15
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,160
Hang in there, buddy.

16
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:04,665
Hey, hey, it's me.

17
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,000
Where are you hit?

18
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,668
Hey, how bad is it? How bad?

19
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,421
Anterior vena cava, bro.

20
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,173
Let me see. Let me see.

21
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,258
Jesus Christ!

22
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,259
Look at her, man.

23
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,427
He killed that girl.

24
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,346
That son of a bitch.
Hey, save your energy.

25
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:19,722
Oh, fuck.

26
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,975
Lacy, Lacy.
You gotta take care of Lacy.

27
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,810
I got it. Don't worry about her. Okay?
Yeah.

28
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,978
Don't worry about her.
Yeah.

29
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,813
How'd you get the fuck into this?
What happened?

30
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,858
Tell me. What happened?
Toro, man.

31
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:31,692
Toro.

32
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,989
I took something from him.
I took something from him.

33
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,161
What are you saying?
What are you saying?

34
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,498
Bro, we're friends.

35
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,169
We did some stupid shit together.
Yeah, we did. Yeah, we did.

36
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,676
Tell John...

37
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:01,556
Tell John
I left something for him.

38
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,140
What? Where?

39
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,684
Tell me. Come on, Cody, where?

40
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,186
John'll know.

41
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,605
John always knows.

42
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,403
Enough, enough.
Come on. I got you, I got you.

43
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,906
Tell John... Tell him I'm sorry.
Enough.

44
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,242
It had to be...

45
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,369
the hard way.

46
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,126
Fuck.

47
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:35,757
I got you, buddy.

48
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,343
Fuck.

49
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,640
Fuck!

50
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,869
Where's this guy?

51
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,499
Name's Ivo. From the Ukraine.

52
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,626
He's pretty good.

53
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,254
But he's done in six moves.

54
00:04:58,632 --> 00:04:59,883
Make that four.

55
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,852
You know, a closed mouth
don't get fed, right?

56
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:15,272
Yeah, you. What's on your mind, neph?

57
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,690
Speak on it, and then dump the trash,

58
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,401
and lock the back door
like I asked you to a half hour ago.

59
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,402
It's just...

60
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,531
I grew up hearing
all these stories about you.

61
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,241
And I watch you
playing chess with someone...

62
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,785
And it doesn't seem to match up
with the dapper dressing,

63
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,205
golf and chess-playing negro
you see before you?

64
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,414
I mean...

65
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:37,545
Afghanistan, special ops, all those
crazy black Rambo Fallujah stories,

66
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:38,963
all the street fighter stories.

67
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:42,299
Look, people tend to exaggerate things

68
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,718
because they have a need
to believe in "myths".

69
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:49,265
But the truth is, I am no "Superman".
I'm not even much of a fighter.

70
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:53,185
See, it's your Uncle Cody.
Now, he's the real bad ass.

71
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,437
You'll see that when he comes back here
for good next week.

72
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,190
And since he's my new
partner at the bar,

73
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,319
you'll get a chance to hear all of
Uncle Cody's tall tales first-hand.

74
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,280
But for now, you need to
dump the trash like I asked you to,

75
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,698
so I can get you back home.

76
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,700
Because I do not want to hear
my sister's mouth

77
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,994
for keeping you out too late.

78
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:20,755
Our beloved Carmine's
is now a fucking mooley hipster joint.

79
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,634
Hell, no! Not on my fucking watch!

80
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,176
Who owns this joint?

81
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:33,935
Tell you what.

82
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:35,978
I'm a businessman.

83
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,397
So, I offer 20K above what you paid,

84
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:42,319
you pack up, set up in Bushwick
or somewhere the fuck else.

85
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:43,778
And all is well.

86
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:44,904
Capisce?

87
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:47,741
No capisce.

88
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,206
You gentlemen have a good night,
we're closed.

89
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,042
Hey, asshole. Do you know who this is?

90
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,003
Relax, Paulie, I got this.

91
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,258
What's your name, wise guy?

92
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:07,635
Payne.

93
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,183
How fucking appropriate.

94
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:17,394
Listen, Payne,
I don't think you fully understand.

95
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:22,107
See, this place is what you call
sentimental value to my community.

96
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:26,571
Many a great man
have drank, bled, and died here.

97
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,740
Now, you take the deal

98
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,409
before I take it off the table,
beat your ass with it.

99
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,744
Ah, ah, ah.

100
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:34,954
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

101
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,790
Checkmate.

102
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,462
You know...

103
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,468
I feel you on the...

104
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,303
sentimental thing.

105
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:54,264
You see, I know the pain of a son

106
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:59,437
whose father was nearly murdered in a
bar he wasn't even allowed inside of.

107
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,065
And for that man's son...

108
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,319
to grow up and one day
own that very bar...

109
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:07,695
You see...

110
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,282
first... you should have
taken no for an answer.

111
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:16,120
Second... you already fucked up by shoving
my nephew when you first came in here.

112
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,246
I was gonna let that slide

113
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,967
because he needs to
toughen up a little bit.

114
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,711
And third... I heard that
mooley comment, not cool.

115
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:28,048
Judging by your little jailhouse shuffle
and them fucked up clothes you're wearing,

116
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,409
you've been locked up for a while.

117
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,886
Well, let me hip you to a few changes

118
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:33,887
since you've been gone.

119
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:38,935
Faucets now come on by themselves
when you put your hands underneath.

120
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:43,022
We've had a black and
an orange president,

121
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,023
and this...

122
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,068
ain't Carmine's no more.

123
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,409
Yeah!
Oh.

124
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:55,868
Uh-huh.

125
00:08:55,869 --> 00:09:01,081
You clearly have no fucking idea
of who you talking to.

126
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,082
Hmm.

127
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:08,964
And clearly, you do not understand
the degree of a fuck that I don't give.

128
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,216
Oh.
Hmm.

129
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,550
Huh.

130
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,013
So... I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

131
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,473
I'm gonna break your jaw for you,

132
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:20,434
lump you up for GP
and then toss your ass out the window

133
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,995
because I've been thinking about
changing that window out anyway.

134
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,691
I'm gonna sleep Paulie string bean
over here last,

135
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,693
so he can tell you what happened to you.

136
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:33,739
That's after the cops throw you
back in prison for parole violation

137
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,659
on account of that .380
you're carrying on your right hip.

138
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,206
But, hey...

139
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,690
you were smart for coming strapped.

140
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,798
But you made one mistake.

141
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,717
Yeah?

142
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,677
What's that?

143
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,682
You let me get too close.

144
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,742
Catch, motherfucker.

145
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,268
You stupid son of a bitch.

146
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,186
You broke my jaw.

147
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,441
No.

148
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,568
No!

149
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,670
I thought you said
you weren't much of a fighter.

150
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,136
I'm not.

151
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:22,098
Fighting is the violent exchange
of physical blows.

152
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,393
It's technically not a fight
if I'm the only one giving the blows.

153
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:27,604
Get a broom.

154
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,982
Cops will be here soon.

155
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:36,779
If you teach me how to fight, I promise
I won't tell my mom what happened.

156
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,198
I told you I don't fight.

157
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,302
Your Uncle Cody's gonna get you right.

158
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,410
Payne.

159
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,250
When?

160
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,329
I'll be there as soon as I can.

161
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,594
Thanks for the call, Arnold.

162
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,601
Uncle Cody is not gonna
be here on Monday.

163
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,192
Mr. Briggs is waiting for you upstairs.

164
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,537
Make sure everything
is locked up downstairs.

165
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:50,912
Okay.

166
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,334
Arnold.

167
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,380
Never expected to see you
in Europe again, John.

168
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,174
Yeah, makes the two of us.

169
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,217
Come on, I'll show you in.

170
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,729
Updated a few things
since you were here last.

171
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,189
Yeah, I see.

172
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,071
How long you staying?

173
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,075
Just until I bury Cody.

174
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,286
You need anything, we're here.

175
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:31,996
I appreciate that.

176
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,999
I'm making the funeral arrangements
for Thursday.

177
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,666
Blanche and I will be there.

178
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,419
She's still putting up
with you after all these years?

179
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,922
Yeah.
Bless her heart.

180
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,656
You're not bringing him home?

181
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:48,178
He would've wanted to be laid to rest here
with the others from his team, Arnold.

182
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,389
You should know that.

183
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,813
Things change, John.

184
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,898
You should know that.

185
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,357
Yeah.

186
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,402
You run the whole unit now.

187
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,738
Not just the unit.
I run all the old units, John.

188
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,198
I got the whole basket.

189
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,991
Climate's changed since you retired.

190
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,576
U.S., Israel...

191
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,788
Hell, even the Brits trying to disavow us.
Shut us down.

192
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,457
I don't want a problem with you, too.

193
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,502
You ain't got to worry about me, Arnold.

194
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:23,047
Well, I don't want to
relive the past either.

195
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,465
Let's just take care of your brother.

196
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,466
You good?

197
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,262
One hundred.
Good.

198
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:30,804
So...

199
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,141
can you tell me what happened?

200
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,184
Where do I start?

201
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,979
<i>Cody! Come on!
Come back!</i>

202
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,741
<i>It was the girl.</i>

203
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,993
<i>She was the last straw.</i>

204
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:05,630
Hell, even Cody's partner almost cracked
and he's seen some shit.

205
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,300
Cody? Cody?

206
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,428
Fuck! Hang in there, buddy.
Hang in there. Fuck!

207
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,180
Yeah, Mason Bellows, yeah.

208
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:16,933
Yeah, based out of Africa.
Good soldier, bit of a loose cannon,

209
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,603
but damn good sniper.
Him and Cody made a great team.

210
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,272
So, what can he tell me
about the investigation?

211
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,399
Stop it, John.

212
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,948
Come on, man.

213
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:38,955
Mason and Cody were part of a task force
created to infiltrate a new drug syndicate

214
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,750
that's getting roots here
in Eastern Europe.

215
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,668
Brutal as hell.

216
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,669
But I don't think
they are even set up yet,

217
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,216
that's why I signed ADS guys to it,
so I could supervise them.

218
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,549
And?

219
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:52,261
"And?" You're retired, John.

220
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:53,971
You run a bar.

221
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,098
Let's keep it that way.

222
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,887
My condolences.

223
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,097
Vali Bibescu. Bucharest PD.

224
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,809
I worked with your brother.
Cody was a great guy.

225
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,518
Were you two close?

226
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,647
As close as you get on a task force.
Me, Mason, Cody...

227
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:17,401
Darling, would you please
wait for me inside?

228
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,194
You can go in,
get off your feet.

229
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,529
Yeah, sure.

230
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,199
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Thank you.

231
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,243
Look, I know your background.

232
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,995
Everyone here knows your background.

233
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:32,374
Either they worked with you
or Cody or both.

234
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,627
There is more to Cody's death
than what it looks like.

235
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,631
And it has to do with the murder
of his confidential informant.

236
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,011
Let me get settled first,
handle Cody's affairs.

237
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,763
I'd like to sit and talk with you
and Mason as soon as possible.

238
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:47,680
Okay.

239
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:48,933
Thanks for coming, Vali.

240
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,957
Just wanted to say
I'm sorry for your loss, man.

241
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,753
You going back to New York?

242
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,631
Nah, man, I think I'm gonna
hang around for a little while.

243
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,593
Payne, I was there when they took him.

244
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:28,638
"They"?

245
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,475
A lot of devils in this town.

246
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,770
Well, do you know where they are?

247
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:37,898
Yeah.

248
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,527
<i>Do you feel it...</i>

249
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,164
<i>on the wind?</i>

250
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:02,715
<i>In the air?</i>

251
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,304
<i>The gates are opening.</i>

252
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,515
<i>Devils rising.</i>

253
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,607
Wait for me by the door.

254
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:24,736
Guys, there's a lot of heat still on us.

255
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,614
You better keep an eye out
and call me for any problem, right?

256
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:28,824
Okay.
You got it, boss.

257
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,723
Who the fuck are you?

258
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,428
Fuck.

259
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:43,852
Oh, fuck.

260
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,363
<i>Vali, it's me.</i>

261
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,823
I've got two problems
I need to get rid of.

262
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:59,158
Where are you now?
I'm at Frankie's studio.

263
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,662
I was tailing Vig.
Shit.

264
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,372
Okay, wait for me there. I'm on my way.

265
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:05,498
Hey, come on, man.

266
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:07,708
<i>I gotta get to the freezer.
Get rid of these two problems.</i>

267
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:11,171
<i>We gotta meet in the morning.</i>
Okay. I can meet in the morning.

268
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,339
And bring the tape.

269
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,092
<i>It's time we show Briggs,
blow this thing wide open.</i>

270
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:18,219
Okay.
Watch your back, Vali.

271
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,346
Be safe.

272
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,015
What are you doing up here?

273
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,059
You just missed
an exciting round of board games

274
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,561
with my sister and her husband.

275
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:28,730
Sorry. Mason, about work.

276
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:29,898
Hmm.

277
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,734
Don't forget you have to drop them off
at the airport in the morning.

278
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,612
Their flight is at 8:00 A.M.
Damn it, I completely forgot.

279
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,490
Don't worry, I'll do it.

280
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,244
And your daughter is in the middle
of one of her marathon showers.

281
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:44,954
Let me get her, so she
can say good night.

282
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,957
Okay, I leave that one up to you.
Okay.

283
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:03,556
Roxy, come downstairs.
You've been in there for over an hour.

284
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,976
Be right out!

285
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,566
Sure...

286
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,444
Hmm. Okay, what do you wanna do?

287
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,157
Mm. No.

288
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:24,244
You don't seem yourself lately.
Ever since Cody...

289
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:29,498
You know, I never like talking
about job in too much detail.

290
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,375
I know, I know.

291
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,837
Just try to enjoy the rest of the night.

292
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,174
Okay...
okay. I will.

293
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,678
No.

294
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,404
Okay, um...

295
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,451
I have no idea.

296
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,287
Street lights are off for some reason.

297
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,248
I'll go call the city.

298
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,043
Okay. What's going on here?

299
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,640
Hey, Vali.
Guess what we are here for?

300
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:28,725
Where's the money?

301
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:31,270
Where the fuck is it?

302
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,149
Susan, don't!

303
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,985
Susan, Susan, no, no!

304
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:39,986
Stupid fuck!

305
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,582
Help, no!

306
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,669
Mom? Dad?

307
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,012
What's going on out there?

308
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,354
Make sure no
one else is upstairs.

309
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,356
I got it.

310
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,325
Mom? Dad?

311
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,386
Come on.

312
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:49,514
Stop! Stop it!

313
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,115
Damn, Mason, what the fuck?

314
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,534
You're filling it up in here.

315
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:11,869
Yeah, it's not me, sir.

316
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,205
It's pretty fucking rough out there.

317
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:17,458
Well, shit's a lot bigger
than we both thought.

318
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,502
Yeah.
That has to end.

319
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:23,214
I need you to tell no one, and I
especially don't want Payne to know.

320
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:26,133
Sir, he knows the ropes,
and maybe he'll be able to help us.

321
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:29,428
He just lost his brother.
He's gone through enough.

322
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,429
Yeah.

323
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:35,185
Well, shit.

324
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,270
I want to see you in my office
first thing in the morning.

325
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:40,023
You go silent for the night.

326
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:43,360
Button it up. That's an order.

327
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:45,904
Yes, sir.

328
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:02,212
Fuck it.

329
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:15,642
It's Payne.
<i>It's Mason. We need to talk.</i>

330
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,269
<i>When and where?</i>

331
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,252
Hey, what's up, peaches?
Hi.

332
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,336
Hey, smiley.

333
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,925
Hello. I'll take a whiskey neat.

334
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,761
Now I know you are a tourist.
Is that right?

335
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:54,848
You're from States.
What gave it away?

336
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,894
Me? I'm Monica.

337
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:03,522
Originally from Slovakia.
Came to Romania for school and stayed.

338
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:04,733
I wanted to be a doctor...

339
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:06,818
ended up as a dancer.

340
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,653
Heard that story before.

341
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,196
<i>All right, all right.</i>

342
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:12,823
<i>I wanna thank everyone
for coming out this evening.</i>

343
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,117
<i>Now, if you all could turn
your hungry eyes</i>

344
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:18,120
<i>towards the main stage
for the next event,</i>

345
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:22,709
<i>we have the mysterious Sky
and her budding Angels.</i>

346
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:56,910
Someone looks like they may be
in some sort of shit with Sky.

347
00:33:57,327 --> 00:34:00,372
Careful.
I heard she wanted to be a lawyer.

348
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,250
Yeah. I heard that story, too.

349
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,006
It's me.

350
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,007
<i>Mason?</i>

351
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:16,720
I thought I told you to go to ground.

352
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,557
Yeah, I know. But I called Payne.
I'm about to meet him right now.

353
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,476
Stop. Now I know I told you
to keep your mouth shut about...

354
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,270
I know exactly what you told me, sir.

355
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:26,605
<i>Okay, I know it's Cody's brother. That's
exactly why I know I can trust him.</i>

356
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,816
Mason...
I can't do this on my own.

357
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,234
This is Mason, isn't it?

358
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,778
Hey, stop it!

359
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:34,113
Isn't it?

360
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:36,241
Yes, sir.

361
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,660
<i>Good. Where are you meeting him?</i>

362
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,583
New York? Is that where you're at?

363
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:50,421
What?
You can't let an ex know where you are?

364
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,715
Baby. Sky...

365
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:55,342
New York is not good for you.

366
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,302
Yeah.

367
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:59,763
Baby, look... you are a flower.

368
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,392
Mm-hmm.
And flowers don't bloom in the concrete.

369
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,730
Yeah, well, I guess you're right.
I kind of like it here.

370
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:10,190
You know, no hassle from the real world.

371
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,191
Mm-hmm.

372
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,529
Our fairy tale, I miss it.

373
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,071
Yeah.

374
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:17,699
That's your fault.

375
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,161
See, you let me get too close.

376
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:31,629
Oh, yeah.

377
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,386
Hey, babe.

378
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,972
Where is he?

379
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,389
Okay.

380
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:48,938
Payne, thanks for coming.
It's good to see you.

381
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:53,360
Wait a minute, John.
You didn't come here to see me?

382
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:57,989
Of course I did.
Hey, I'll leave you with this.

383
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:01,283
No way, no fucking way.
You didn't come here to see me.

384
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,620
You came here for work, didn't you?

385
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,121
Babe...
Look, forget it.

386
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,124
Forget it. Fucking bastard.

387
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,629
Same old problems?

388
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,633
Hi. Let's have a good time.

389
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:19,969
Come on.

390
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:23,889
Good to see you.

391
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:28,185
Guessing you're here 'cause you wanna
know what happened to your brother.

392
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,354
So, what do you know?

393
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:30,646
Not enough.

394
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:32,482
Well, let's start there.

395
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,567
Don't fight. Come on!

396
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:38,571
It's about a girl.

397
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,282
Always is, isn't it?

398
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,327
Let's go, let's go.

399
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:47,371
Come on.

400
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,960
Give me a minute.

401
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,595
Please stop!

402
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:06,557
No!

403
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:11,896
Sky! Hey! You okay?
John!

404
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:13,522
John.

405
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:16,233
Hey, you heard her, right?
Get the fuck out. Let her go.

406
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,234
John!

407
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,485
No!
Hey!

408
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:19,806
Wait for your turn.

409
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:54,772
Hey.

410
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,027
Let him be a hero, yeah?

411
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:03,239
That money they paid you
to walk away and shut your mouth.

412
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,993
Hmm. Have a nice day.

413
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:25,220
You good, Sky? You good? Okay.
Yeah, I'm fine.

414
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,554
Hey!

415
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,056
No means no, motherfucker.

416
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:31,266
Now get your shit,
get this earless motherfucker

417
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,602
and get the fuck out of here.

418
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:35,605
Yo, man, your ear.

419
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:39,943
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

420
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:41,985
All right.

421
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:44,488
You okay? How are you feeling?
I'm okay.

422
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:47,282
Yeah, I'm fine.
Okay. All right, now, go home, clean up.

423
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,700
I'll see you later, all right?
Okay.

424
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,744
Go ahead.
Okay.

425
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,292
Hey, you okay, man?

426
00:38:57,293 --> 00:39:00,003
I was about to come check on you.
Yeah, it's all good.

427
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,631
Somebody just wanted to lend me an ear.

428
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:08,471
This is Macallan 25 from
Luther, our bouncer.

429
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,640
Thanks, babe. Thank you.

430
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:16,062
Right now, you're the only one
I know I could trust.

431
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:18,522
Same.

432
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,066
Hey, look.

433
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:25,320
Your brother and I
were working the Toro case.

434
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,447
It's all there, man.

435
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,490
Now it's just me and Bibescu.

436
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,450
Vali, yeah. I met him at the funeral.

437
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:33,037
He wanted to talk to me about something.
For good reason.

438
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,873
Look, Vali uncovered a tape

439
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:39,626
of a hooker getting killed
by a scumbag, Joe Vig.

440
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,130
He's a capo in the Toro syndicate.

441
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,717
He's a dark, sadistic fuck.

442
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,720
Anyway, the tape shows they handcuff

443
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:52,097
her pimp to another hooker
barely out of her fuckin' teens.

444
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:55,476
The sick fuck blows
them both up on tape.

445
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:01,941
Vali shows the tape to your brother,
Cody does not take it well.

446
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:03,984
Goes after Vig.

447
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,528
<i>There, you see him?
Vig's there. Right there.</i>

448
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:07,529
Stop the car.

449
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,197
Stop the fucking car.

450
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,532
Cody! Hey!

451
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,661
Freeze!

452
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:35,558
Cody! Come on! Come on!

453
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,776
So, where can I find this Joe Vig?

454
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,570
Behind me.

455
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:03,627
Red shirt.

456
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,510
You see that slimy fat fuck
he's talking to?

457
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,054
Tattoo?
Mm-hmm. That's Frankie Fine.

458
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,263
He runs a club for him.

459
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,100
He's also got a dance studio
down at Postei.

460
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:21,019
And Joe Vig, he comes in
every Monday, Thursday nights

461
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,188
to check on the new talent
that Fine brings in.

462
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,358
They say they're using the dancers
as drug mules for Toro.

463
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:29,528
All the girls here, dancers, singers,
all of them looking for a way out.

464
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:31,989
New, fresh fucking face they can use.

465
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,032
Now, your brother said
he had evidence proving

466
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,284
that Toro's behind
the whole fucking thing.

467
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:39,664
Said he got mailed the evidence
by an Ash Polaski.

468
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:42,416
Problem is, I think
your brother hid the evidence.

469
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:45,086
I've been looking, and
I can't find shit.

470
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,045
Yo, yo!

471
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,505
Uh, listen up.

472
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,967
Any of you young ladies in the crowd,

473
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:54,761
if you think you have what it takes
to be on my stage,

474
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:59,267
come see me,
right here in the cabaret club.

475
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,356
We have a meeting with Briggs
in the morning, Vali and I.

476
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,357
We're gonna show him the tape.

477
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,358
Here...

478
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,236
Cody's gun.

479
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,531
I hope you have better luck
finding what he left than I did.

480
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:17,118
Listen, Payne,

481
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:20,038
for real, you watch your back, okay?

482
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,165
See you.

483
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:52,486
What are you doing here, sir?

484
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:55,572
What part of going silent tonight
did you not understand?

485
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,074
Fuck.
So, what was this?

486
00:42:57,075 --> 00:43:00,202
A fucking social call? You and
John just blowing off some steam?

487
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:01,870
Yeah, I guess that was it, sir.
Yeah, that was it.

488
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:03,288
And frankly, I'm starting to feel

489
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,082
I'm the only motherfucker
trying to solve this case.

490
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,249
Enough!

491
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,544
Look, this thing's turning into
something bigger than Cody's death.

492
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,798
Bigger than either one of you
could possibly fathom.

493
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:13,799
You got it?

494
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,258
Yes, sir.

495
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,513
It's Blanche.

496
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,641
I guess
you should take your fucking call.

497
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,142
Blanche.

498
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,854
I told you this case is a nightmare.

499
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:30,358
Blanche, I know it's the holidays.
Don't you think I'd rather be at home?

500
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,151
Give me a second, hon.

501
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,696
Don't fucking test me, Mason.

502
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,741
I'm out of fucking reasons tonight.

503
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,787
I'm on my way home, babe.

504
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:45,039
We're on the same fucking team, Briggs.

505
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,005
We are on the same fucking team!

506
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,341
What the fuck is that?

507
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:19,614
Fuck!

508
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:23,243
Fuck!

509
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,203
Oh, fuck.

510
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,354
<i>All around you...</i>

511
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,833
Brother, your hiding
places never change.

512
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,928
Thumb drive. Nice.

513
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:19,651
<i>You had no business to
open your mouth about us, Ash.</i>

514
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:21,361
<i>I thought we were amigos.</i>

515
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:23,321
<i>But Cody says something different.</i>

516
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,156
<i>Not to mention you pissed off Toro.</i>

517
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,368
<i>You ratted me out, Ash.</i>

518
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,912
<i>Where's my money?
Please. Toro, please...</i>

519
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:32,831
<i>Take his lying teeth.</i>

520
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,835
<i>Hold still, you idiot.
You almost made me rip out your tongue.</i>

521
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:39,005
<i>And I've not come to that part yet.</i>

522
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:41,799
<i>Should I go for another incisor?</i>

523
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:46,095
<i>Okay, okay. Hold still.
I'll just take your molar!</i>

524
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,189
<i>Jesus, man.</i>

525
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,902
<i>With all those teeth missing,
you look like a fucking jack-o'-lantern.</i>

526
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:04,321
<i>Makes me want to
put a candle on his mouth.</i>

527
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,614
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

528
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,659
<i>Please, Toro, please.</i>

529
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,911
<i>Consider this your first warning.</i>

530
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:15,708
<i>Next time, someone else might be
on that chair that has to pay the Vig.</i>

531
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:21,088
<i>Please, Toro! Please!
That's enough.</i>

532
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:22,964
<i>No, no, no!</i>

533
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:48,157
<i>You really disappointed me, Ash.</i>

534
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:52,619
<i>Now, your brother said
he had evidence proving</i>

535
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,704
<i>that Toro's behind
the whole fucking thing.</i>

536
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:58,125
<i>Said he got mailed the evidence
by an Ash Polaski.</i>

537
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:08,260
<i>Please, Toro! Please!</i>

538
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,429
<i>That's enough.
No!</i>

539
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,932
<i>No, no, no!</i>

540
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,690
And what did you
leave me on this?

541
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:23,818
Password.

542
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:41,042
<i>Right now, I'm not sure who I can trust.</i>

543
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:42,669
<i>So much shit going on,</i>

544
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:45,505
<i>I'm still trying to figure out
why they haven't come to kill me.</i>

545
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:48,842
<i>I've got the five million
that Ash Polaski took from Toro.</i>

546
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:51,469
<i>All of it,
for negotiating when the time is right.</i>

547
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,347
<i>Before he died,
he gave me a key to a lock box</i>

548
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:58,017
<i>stashed at Mogooaia Palace,
an old castle on the outskirts of town.</i>

549
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:02,439
<i>In this situation, the only person that
I trust is gonna be my brother, John.</i>

550
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:04,692
<i>I've hidden the key with this recording.</i>

551
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,442
<i>John...</i>

552
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,529
<i>I know you know what to do.</i>

553
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,783
Five mil.

554
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:22,501
Good evening, ladies.

555
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,006
Gee, I hope I didn't startle you.

556
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:29,800
Joe, what's up?

557
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:33,052
The guy tonight at the club, back table,

558
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:35,181
you both seemed to pay him
some really good attention.

559
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,639
Who was he?

560
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,434
He was just a customer.

561
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,855
Sorry?
He was just a customer...

562
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,609
Oh, I'm sorry.

563
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,069
Did I hurt you?

564
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:52,907
You think I'm fucking stupid?

565
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,241
Do I look fucking stupid to you?

566
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,076
I asked you one simple question.

567
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,246
Joe, he's my ex, he came to...
To what?

568
00:49:59,622 --> 00:50:02,416
To your rescue?
Breaking off arms and hands?

569
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:03,833
Just a customer, huh?

570
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:10,632
I believe you owe the house some money
that was taking off some patrons.

571
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:11,633
Yes.

572
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:13,009
I see everything.

573
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,802
And so do the security cameras.

574
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:15,845
Now, talk to me.

575
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,806
I don't... I don't know anything about it.
No, no, no, no, no.

576
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,018
You see, you don't lie to me, bitch!

577
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,062
Sky, run!

578
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:26,106
No, not here, man. Go get them.

579
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,030
This is gonna be fun.

580
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:22,620
Ah, fuck!
Mason, what the fuck, man?

581
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:25,249
I gave you
the fucking keys, bro.

582
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,710
Hey, get me up.

583
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:29,919
Ah, fuck!

584
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,297
What the fuck happened to you?

585
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:35,801
Oh, you know, usual day.
I got hit by a car, fucked up by you.

586
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:38,011
Fuck.
You could've knocked, man.

587
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:38,970
I almost killed you.

588
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:41,682
Well, join the line, man,
everybody's trying to do that lately.

589
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:43,516
Oh, fuck.

590
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,186
Is that Joe Vig?

591
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:51,317
No, he was still at the club when I,
when I left. It was someone else.

592
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:53,151
Someone else, huh?

593
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:56,280
Yeah, fucking guy in a cowboy hat,
I couldn't get his face.

594
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:57,822
Toro, right?

595
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:01,618
Yeah, it has to be.
He's a cold, heartless fuck.

596
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,370
You're pretty banged up, man.

597
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,580
Hey, you want a beer?

598
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:07,082
Oh, yeah.

599
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:08,959
Oh, fuck.

600
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,550
Feet.
Oh, yeah.

601
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:18,927
Just like your brother.

602
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,055
Cheers.

603
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:34,318
Oh, fuck.

604
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,820
Payne, I think they killed Vali.

605
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,072
What makes you think that?

606
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:41,074
He said we're gonna meet this morning,
he never showed.

607
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:43,117
<i>I can meet you in the morning.</i>

608
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,536
Vali always shows,
it's just the way he is.

609
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:46,871
He said he was gonna bring the tape

610
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:49,540
about the girl and the pimp
getting killed.

611
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:52,086
I called his cell phone. Nothing, man.

612
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:53,545
Same with the house.

613
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:58,967
Listen, man, Toro tried
to kill me twice.

614
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:00,719
He thinks I'm dead.

615
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,847
Vali would have been the last one.

616
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,893
Nah, man, there's one more.

617
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:11,688
Me.

618
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:19,779
Tell me about this Ash Polaski guy.

619
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,240
Ash? Yeah, I guess that...

620
00:53:21,824 --> 00:53:23,408
He was your brother's snitch.

621
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:25,535
Well, at least he was
until they found him dead

622
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:27,370
with a hole in his face
where his mouth used to be.

623
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:28,705
Check it out.

624
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:31,208
Okay. What we got?

625
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,501
<i>Not too mention
you pissed off Toro.</i>

626
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:34,669
Well, look at this.

627
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:36,797
That's Polaski. Where did you get this?
From Cody.

628
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:41,551
Yeah, it's enough to fry Joe Vig.

629
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:43,845
I watched this thing
like a hundred times

630
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:45,431
and there's nothing on Toro.

631
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:49,559
You can't identify him,
his voice is disguised, he's...

632
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,476
I'll tell you what he is,

633
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,353
he's the same fucking scumbag
that ran me down.

634
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:53,813
Look at that stupid hat.

635
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:55,174
<i>That's enough.</i>

636
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:57,192
<i>No, no, no, no!</i>

637
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:03,030
Yeah, I've never seen your brother like
this before that night in the garage.

638
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:05,534
Look at this.
So, so out of fucking control...

639
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:06,994
wanting Vig.

640
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,372
But he was determined.
You know how he was.

641
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,668
Fuck, man. I miss him, man.

642
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:19,422
Yeah.

643
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:26,472
Cody ever talk to you about his girl?

644
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:28,890
Lacy?

645
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,685
Yeah, Lacy Love, all the time.

646
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:33,729
How about her sister?

647
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,818
This place is good.
Mm-hmm.

648
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:44,281
Can we take a look at this last one
before you have to head back?

649
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:45,741
Yeah, sure.
Please?

650
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:49,202
But would you be upset with me
if I wait for you here?

651
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:51,079
No. Yeah.
Yeah? Okay, go on then.

652
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,457
Love you for taking me to lunch.

653
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:55,626
You're welcome.

654
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:59,755
I am going to ace that history test.
I know you will.

655
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,064
She looks just like you.

656
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:24,529
You know who I am, right?

657
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,118
How long were you and Cody, uh...

658
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:31,995
Married?

659
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,706
Just for a short while.

660
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,209
I loved him.

661
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:42,089
He wanted to save me, you know?

662
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:43,882
Yeah, I know.

663
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:45,509
But from who?

664
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:57,937
Hi.
Hey.

665
00:55:57,938 --> 00:56:00,440
I know you.
Yeah, you do.

666
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:01,899
Since you were this big.

667
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:05,946
Yeah, now I'm grown up.
I see that.

668
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:09,408
You worked with Uncle Cody?
I did, yeah.

669
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:12,744
You doing okay?

670
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:15,371
Yeah.

671
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,373
Great.

672
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,545
I miss him.

673
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,381
Me, too.

674
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:28,998
Frankie's the one that
dragged me into their world.

675
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:32,138
Told me if I don't help them
recruit girls,

676
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:34,474
they will destroy everything
and everyone around me.

677
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:38,645
Joe Vig is crazy,
but Toro, he's the devil.

678
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:42,481
It wasn't until I agreed
that I found out what they really do.

679
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:43,775
Traffic drugs.

680
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:47,654
I wanted to get out,
but Vig made it very clear that

681
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:48,989
if I stopped...

682
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,033
they'll go after Erin.

683
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:54,995
My sister is 15, John.

684
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,415
Who knows what they would do
to a 15-year-old girl?

685
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:03,795
Is there a place you could take Erin
and disappear for a while?

686
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,301
I tried that before.

687
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,094
Toro did that?

688
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:13,972
It might as well have been him.

689
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:17,684
Vig does the hitting. It's his thing.

690
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:21,438
They gave a few hours to see Erin.
I have to get back soon.

691
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:26,443
There's a major shipment going out.

692
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:28,987
Frankie has the girls.

693
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:32,407
You should take care of yourself.

694
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:34,825
Yeah.

695
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,410
You too.

696
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:41,791
Thanks.

697
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:48,172
Are you ready to go?
Yeah.

698
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,131
Okay.
Ready?

699
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,132
Yeah.

700
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:53,886
Are you okay?
Yeah.

701
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,764
Come on,
I'll walk you to the train station.

702
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:13,323
<i>Time to pay the Vig.</i>

703
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:22,832
<i>No, please!
Please don't do this! Joe!</i>

704
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:34,302
<i>Don't do this! Joe, please!
Bye-bye, bitches.</i>

705
00:58:36,138 --> 00:58:38,724
<i>How does it feel
to watch the ones you love suffer</i>

706
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:41,143
<i>knowing you're glued
to your screen helpless?</i>

707
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:42,853
<i>Please!</i>

708
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:44,812
<i>No!</i>

709
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:47,648
<i>No!</i>

710
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:48,817
<i>Please!</i>

711
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:04,583
Two, three, four, and go!

712
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:08,377
Yes. Smile. Smile brings money. Smile.

713
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,172
Come on, girls. Bottoms up. Bottoms up.

714
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:13,591
That's it, girls. Smile.

715
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:16,010
Okay, I want you to feel sexy.

716
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:17,637
To be sexy.

717
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:19,805
Mmm, mmm?

718
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:21,724
Turn, down and...

719
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:31,108
Up. Yes! That's it.

720
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:33,195
That's the money shot, yeah.

721
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:35,279
Joe Vig?

722
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:37,031
Joe Vig!

723
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:39,701
What the fuck?
What the fuck is going on here?

724
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,244
Joe Vig?

725
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:43,163
Who the fuck are you, pal?

726
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:47,542
Joe Vig?
Doesn't ring a bell.

727
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:51,880
I don't remember who that is.

728
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:55,926
How about now?
You know... you know what?

729
00:59:56,802 --> 00:59:57,718
How about now?

730
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:59,930
Can one of you bitches
call security, please?

731
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:05,893
How about now?
I... I just run the club.

732
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:08,020
I don't get involved with dramas.

733
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:11,482
Please, I hope you find
everything you need some other place.

734
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:13,109
Let's take a walk.
No!

735
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:18,782
Security! Bitches!

736
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:22,035
Where is he?
Up there! He's got Frankie!

737
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:55,234
Ahh!

738
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:01,950
Oh, no, no, no. Not hammer, please.

739
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:03,743
Oh, no.

740
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:07,581
Joe Vig?
I don't know nothing!

741
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:09,331
Joe Vi...

742
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,223
Vig's upstairs. Vig's upstairs.

743
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:28,058
I swear...

744
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:32,188
Let's go.

745
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:38,528
Oh, fuck!

746
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:43,657
Hurry, we don't have much time!

747
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:44,867
Move it!

748
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:46,620
Don't leave anything behind.

749
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,704
Come on, come on!

750
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,456
Do you hear me? Move it.

751
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:52,374
Pack it all, put it away now.

752
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,127
Pack the stuff and move it away now!

753
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:05,930
Vig!

754
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:10,351
Fuck! You shot me! You shot me!

755
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:11,978
Son of a bitch!

756
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,873
So, you like to hurt
women, motherfucker?

757
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:35,835
You must be upset about Sky and Monica?

758
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:40,215
They were a blast.

759
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:49,974
Tough guy, huh?

760
01:02:50,392 --> 01:02:52,477
You think you have the balls
to come here and get me?

761
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,604
Do you know how protected I am?

762
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:02,529
You cops are all dead meat.

763
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:05,611
You just don't know it yet.

764
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:54,748
Motherfucker.

765
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:58,500
You're lucky I don't have time
to torture your ass.

766
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,253
This is better than you deserve.

767
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:12,473
Please...

768
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,310
Please don't kill me.

769
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,899
Look, I just run the club.

770
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:24,443
Everything you see around here,
that man forced me.

771
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:26,029
I swear it.
What man?

772
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:27,529
Toro.

773
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:30,784
So, you've seen him?

774
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:34,620
He pops in and out from time to time,
but he's always covered up.

775
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:36,039
That weird voice of his...

776
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:40,126
<i>Frankie Fine.
You'll do as I say.</i>

777
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,757
He only comes here for Lacy. Please.
Lacy Love?

778
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:49,259
That man is obsessed with her.

779
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:52,263
He'll never let her go.
Lacy will tell you.

780
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:55,697
Shut the fuck up.

781
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:58,727
Go. Get in there!

782
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:04,191
You're Toro's girl?

783
01:05:04,192 --> 01:05:05,192
What?

784
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:07,028
No.
Tell him that.

785
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:10,823
You have to believe me, John.

786
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:12,032
I loved Cody.

787
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:14,369
Toro, he's crazy.
He thinks I'm his, and I never...

788
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:18,540
I swear to you.

789
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:26,172
Okay.

790
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:30,968
Okay, I'll help you get out from under
this, but I know you know who Toro is.

791
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:34,346
So, I want you to set up a
meeting for me, tonight at 8:00

792
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:37,683
at Mogooaia Palace
right outside the city.

793
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:39,351
Tell him I have his five mil,

794
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:42,479
tell him Joe Vig is dead,
Frankie Fine is dead...

795
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:45,524
All he has to bring is you.

796
01:05:45,525 --> 01:05:49,611
Tell him the trade is you for the money.
That's the only way he's gonna come.

797
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,573
Now you say you loved Cody, right?

798
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:54,909
Then you'll do this for me.

799
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,079
Oh, and tell him...

800
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:01,875
if he fucks with me,
I'm gonna send his ass home.

801
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:13,678
Oh. Hey.

802
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:16,763
I was just about to call you
about Christmas dinner next week,

803
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:17,891
you think you can make it?

804
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:19,851
Hey, hey, um...

805
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,146
Arnold, I need your help, man.

806
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:25,772
I just set up a meeting with Toro.

807
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:27,484
Toro?
Yeah.

808
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:28,735
That's impossible.

809
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:33,739
Look, I came across
something Toro wants.

810
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:37,493
I'd like to make a deal with him,
but I need backup, okay?

811
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:38,452
See, Arnold,

812
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:41,663
I just want to give Toro what he wants
and free Cody's wife.

813
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:44,666
That's all I want.
Toro has no connection to Cody's death.

814
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,835
You're mixing up two different things.

815
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:49,713
All this stuff with
Lacy Love and... I...

816
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:51,840
Arnold, I just, I just need your help.

817
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:54,635
Just you, and some of the old ADS guys

818
01:06:54,636 --> 01:06:57,013
to cover my six,
while I make the exchange.

819
01:06:57,889 --> 01:07:00,224
Hey, you could have all the credit
once we catch Toro.

820
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:02,602
I just need her out.
That's it. That's the deal.

821
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:16,533
Briggs is out. It's just us.

822
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,455
You sure you're down for this?

823
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:26,125
Cody's dead, Payne.

824
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:27,960
Team's dead.

825
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:31,130
It's just you and me,
so, yeah, I'm down.

826
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:32,756
When and where?

827
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:35,552
And how many of these motherfuckers
do I get to kill?

828
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:07,375
<i>Mogooaia Palace.</i>

829
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:12,046
<i>An ancient palace with deep roots
to the history of the region.</i>

830
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:17,594
<i>Built over a hole in the ground
that they called the Gate to Hell.</i>

831
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:23,266
<i>The hole's said to be so deep
that no one could see the bottom.</i>

832
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:29,355
<i>Since then, they say animal-human hybrids
were reported to have crawled out of it,</i>

833
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:33,651
<i>and dark-winged otherworldly creatures
flew in the vicinity.</i>

834
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:39,490
<i>If this is the gate to hell, it's
time to slam that fucking thing shut.</i>

835
01:09:55,942 --> 01:09:58,610
Payne, I have visual
on you, you're covered.

836
01:09:58,611 --> 01:09:59,779
You find high ground?

837
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:02,073
<i>Affirmative.</i>

838
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:08,496
Payne, we got bogeys.

839
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,623
<i>Two vans and a car.</i>

840
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:15,544
But they're breaking off.

841
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:18,172
<i>They're flanking us.</i>
Yeah, I figured that.

842
01:10:18,673 --> 01:10:19,673
Keep me posted.

843
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:43,698
One van headed to you.
Lost visual on the other two.

844
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:46,658
Moving.

845
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:51,748
Check your position. Ready?

846
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:19,358
Okay. Got eyes on the other two players.
Pulling up to you now.

847
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:28,284
About six on foot on the ground.

848
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:31,746
<i>I need you to spot 'em for me.</i>
Affirmative.

849
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:48,512
Payne...

850
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:49,514
<i>Toro.</i>

851
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:56,270
Payne, I'm made.

852
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:58,647
On the move.

853
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:04,236
Payne!

854
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:08,073
You wanted to deal with me?
I'm right here.

855
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:11,243
And I brought your brother's
little whore, just like you asked.

856
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:17,500
I know you're out there somewhere,
hovering among the dead.

857
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:21,002
<i>Anything along the outer wall?
Negative.</i>

858
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:22,796
<i>Moving to the
south of the palace.</i>

859
01:12:22,797 --> 01:12:23,797
<i>Copy.</i>

860
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:27,510
You out there, Payne?

861
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:29,678
Among the dead?

862
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:33,139
A fitting grave for John Payne

863
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:35,100
who walks among the dead.

864
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:37,019
Did you know that, John?

865
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:40,647
John Payne walks among the dead.

866
01:12:40,648 --> 01:12:42,066
Did you know that?

867
01:12:42,817 --> 01:12:44,610
How did you know that, Toro?

868
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:52,410
Coward. Come out.

869
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:55,413
<i>Still no sign of him.
The outer wall is clear.</i>

870
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:57,999
<i>Wait. Sir, we have something.</i>

871
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:00,750
<i>We spotted a shooter
in the north-east mezzanine.</i>

872
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:03,295
You set yet?
Payne, I got him painted.

873
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:04,796
Say the word.

874
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:07,716
Payne! You wanted
me and I'm here.

875
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:08,801
Take the shot.

876
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:10,970
This is for his family.

877
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:18,935
Fuck.

878
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:23,900
This is for Monica.

879
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:40,958
You can't hide, motherfucker.

880
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:43,711
That's for Vali.

881
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:48,341
And this is for his family.

882
01:13:52,053 --> 01:13:53,220
Too late for running.

883
01:14:16,035 --> 01:14:17,203
Fuck.

884
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,083
All right, Toro. Let's do this.

885
01:14:22,667 --> 01:14:24,126
Where's my money, Payne?

886
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:27,213
It's in the chapel.
Let her go and I'll take you to it.

887
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:32,635
It's in a briefcase. Five million euro.

888
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:34,929
Fuck.
Let her go.

889
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:37,722
And I'll show you where it is.

890
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:40,518
How do I know
you're not lying about what's inside?

891
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:44,312
I get the money, you get the girl.

892
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:46,816
I drew him out. Do you have a shot?

893
01:14:47,525 --> 01:14:48,900
I got him.

894
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:51,027
I got you painted, motherfucker.

895
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:52,863
<i>Sir, we have
the shooter located.</i>

896
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:59,286
Finally.
Take them both out and end this.

897
01:14:59,704 --> 01:15:01,247
John, look out!

898
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:08,461
Lacy!

899
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:21,434
Briggs.

900
01:15:21,809 --> 01:15:23,644
Your own fucking men.

901
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:43,938
You got bogeys on your left.

902
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:40,971
Payne.

903
01:16:43,557 --> 01:16:44,642
It's over.

904
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:47,103
Throw the weapon in the pit.

905
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:00,907
Nice trick, Arnold.

906
01:17:00,908 --> 01:17:01,909
Where is the case?

907
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:17,132
So...

908
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,884
what's going to be the story
this time, Arnold?

909
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:22,929
No story necessary, John. I'm done.

910
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:25,765
Everybody's dead. Including Lacy.

911
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:28,143
I'm gonna collect my five million
and disappear.

912
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:30,020
Now, hand over the case.

913
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:32,231
Oh, you're gonna disappear, all right.

914
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:34,900
You know,
I already figured out it was you.

915
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:37,027
How long have you known?

916
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:40,072
<i>Well, the hat was cute.</i>

917
01:17:43,409 --> 01:17:47,245
<i>But not many people are running around
with a pearl-handled 1911</i>

918
01:17:47,246 --> 01:17:49,540
<i>with our old unit insignia on it.</i>

919
01:17:53,544 --> 01:17:54,670
Not too smart, Arnold.

920
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:56,963
What are you thinking?

921
01:17:56,964 --> 01:18:00,216
Think you're just gonna disappear?
How do you think this is gonna end?

922
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:02,970
"John 'The Legend' Payne,
killed in action."

923
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,638
"Toro evades authorities."

924
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:08,642
Sucks, 'cause I was damn close
to getting him.

925
01:18:09,727 --> 01:18:11,312
Now hand it over, Payne.

926
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:34,126
Looking for me?

927
01:18:34,877 --> 01:18:38,255
Oh, yeah.
I'll gut you just like I did Vali.

928
01:18:44,929 --> 01:18:46,430
<i>...just like I did Vali.</i>

929
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:49,432
Here's what we're gonna do.

930
01:18:49,433 --> 01:18:51,100
<i>Tear Vali's home apart.</i>

931
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:52,895
<i>Just find my money.</i>

932
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:16,459
Why did you do it, Arnold?

933
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:19,963
You had the whole unit running around
in circles, coming up empty.

934
01:19:19,964 --> 01:19:22,131
You could've reassigned everybody.

935
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:24,467
Why didn't you just do that?
Why kill them?

936
01:19:24,468 --> 01:19:25,970
Why Cody?

937
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:28,389
She loved him.

938
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:32,059
I wanted her to love me.

939
01:19:32,643 --> 01:19:35,520
Simple. He had to go.

940
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:39,858
That wasn't business.
That, my old friend, was truly personal.

941
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:52,912
What about Vali's family?

942
01:19:52,913 --> 01:19:53,830
His kids?

943
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:54,914
Give me the goddamn case!

944
01:19:54,915 --> 01:19:55,873
They all had to die

945
01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:57,709
because of your obsession
with a woman that you couldn't have?

946
01:19:57,710 --> 01:19:59,086
All pawns, John.

947
01:20:07,928 --> 01:20:10,847
I got tired of being a pawn
in somebody else's game.

948
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:12,557
Decided to run one of my own.

949
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:15,184
Now save me the trouble
of wiping the blood off that

950
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:16,562
and throw me the fucking case!

951
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,465
That's for Cody, you son of a bitch.

952
01:20:49,887 --> 01:20:52,263
Enough! Give me the goddamn case!

953
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:53,848
I know what's gonna happen.

954
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:56,169
You're gonna try to shoot me,
but it's not going to stop...

955
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:14,119
And then...

956
01:21:17,081 --> 01:21:18,332
then we're gonna fight.

957
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:21,251
It's not gonna go your way.

958
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:34,056
Then...

959
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:37,643
I'm gonna make you pay...

960
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:43,356
for Sky, Monica, Lacy, Vali,

961
01:21:43,357 --> 01:21:45,483
his family and Cody,

962
01:21:45,484 --> 01:21:47,486
with your miserable fucking life.

963
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:55,536
Yeah, that's right.
You should have checked your ammo.

964
01:22:00,374 --> 01:22:01,374
<i>Before that,</i>

965
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:04,420
<i>you should've changed
the combination of your safe.</i>

966
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:22,020
You let me get too close, Arnold.

967
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:03,139
I'll be with you in a minute.

968
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:04,808
Please sit wherever you want.

969
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:27,581
What can I get you?

970
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:29,833
Well, hello, Adina.

971
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:33,170
Well, I am Adina...

972
01:25:35,005 --> 01:25:36,005
Smith.

973
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:39,635
Not to be mistaken with the other Adina
who works on the night shift.

974
01:25:40,636 --> 01:25:41,636
That's good.

975
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:47,266
Yeah. My doctor says
it's a good therapy.

976
01:25:47,267 --> 01:25:50,354
You know, going outside,
talking to people.

977
01:25:51,521 --> 01:25:52,648
Interacting.

978
01:25:53,732 --> 01:25:55,359
That's good. I'll keep that in mind.

979
01:25:56,485 --> 01:25:59,571
You mentioned a doctor, uh,
what happened to you?

980
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:03,074
An accident.

981
01:26:03,075 --> 01:26:04,576
A car accident.

982
01:26:06,078 --> 01:26:08,245
My husband would've killed me

983
01:26:08,246 --> 01:26:10,582
if he heard me giving out
all my information like that.

984
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:13,085
Sounds like a very smart man.

985
01:26:15,045 --> 01:26:16,129
He was.

986
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:21,760
But he left me a gift.

987
01:26:31,645 --> 01:26:33,814
Um... Oh, wow.

988
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:37,024
So, what can I get you?

989
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,901
I'll just have coffee.

990
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:39,903
Okay.

991
01:26:40,987 --> 01:26:43,031
Oh, Adina, may I borrow your pen?

992
01:26:44,241 --> 01:26:45,659
Sure, John.

993
01:26:48,286 --> 01:26:49,996
I'll be right back with your coffee.

994
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:51,580
All right.

995
01:27:13,937 --> 01:27:14,938
Oh, and Lacy...

996
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:23,405
everything is gonna be just fine
real soon.

997
01:27:26,575 --> 01:27:28,452
I'll be right back to take your order.

998
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:34,643
<i>If you ever find yourself
passing through New York,</i>

999
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:35,976
<i>look me up.</i>

1000
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:39,940
<i>The place that used to be called
House of Payne...</i>

1001
01:28:40,982 --> 01:28:42,317
<i>is now called...</i>

1002
01:28:43,193 --> 01:28:44,194
<i>Cody's.</i>

1003
01:28:45,445 --> 01:28:46,905
<i>Until then...</i>

1004
01:28:49,074 --> 01:28:50,116
<i>John.</i>

1005
01:28:54,037 --> 01:28:55,789
Cody would've wanted that, bro.

1006
01:28:56,665 --> 01:28:58,750
Yeah, and now it's done.

1007
01:29:22,232 --> 01:29:23,899
<i>So, you're gonna stick around?</i>

1008
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:26,193
I'm thinking about it. You?

1009
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:29,738
Nah, man. I'm looking forward
to the peace and quiet of my own bar.

1010
01:29:29,739 --> 01:29:30,740
Right.

1011
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:34,118
Well, now I know where to get a
free beer when I'm in New York.

1012
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:35,245
Yeah, for sure.

1013
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:39,958
What?
Peace and quiet, huh?

1014
01:29:41,334 --> 01:29:42,918
Well, I heard you redecorated the bar

1015
01:29:42,919 --> 01:29:45,087
with a couple of goons,
before you came out here.

1016
01:29:45,088 --> 01:29:46,171
Huh?

1017
01:29:46,172 --> 01:29:47,465
Zito brothers.

1018
01:29:47,924 --> 01:29:49,801
Mm-hmm, I know.

1019
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:52,595
What I heard was
you beat one with his own gun,

1020
01:29:52,596 --> 01:29:54,138
the other you threw through the window

1021
01:29:54,139 --> 01:29:56,432
because you wanted to
change that shit anyway.

1022
01:29:56,433 --> 01:29:59,518
And my favorite part, you told them
how you're gonna kick their ass

1023
01:29:59,519 --> 01:30:00,770
before you kicked their ass.

1024
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:02,522
Does that ring any bells?

1025
01:30:03,773 --> 01:30:05,941
Well, you know,
people tend to exaggerate things

1026
01:30:05,942 --> 01:30:07,484
because they have this...
Yeah, I know,

1027
01:30:07,485 --> 01:30:09,125
did you-didn't you have
the fight already?

1028
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:12,489
Fight. Well, hey, a fight
is a violent exchange of...

1029
01:30:12,490 --> 01:30:13,533
Listen, man...

1030
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:15,910
peace and quiet, my ass.

1031
01:30:17,871 --> 01:30:19,414
You want that beer or what?

1032
01:30:23,918 --> 01:30:26,712
So, ADS, they asked me
to take over from Briggs,

1033
01:30:26,713 --> 01:30:28,047
can you believe that shit?

1034
01:30:28,048 --> 01:30:28,964
Oh, yeah?

1035
01:30:28,965 --> 01:30:32,010
So, I guess if you ever get tired
of serving drinks, give me a call.
