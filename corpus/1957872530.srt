30
00:01:20,598 --> 00:01:21,381
Okay.

31
00:01:21,431 --> 00:01:24,333
Anybody got one of my
residual checks in your pocket?

32
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,102
Do I look alright?

33
00:01:28,152 --> 00:01:30,622
I mean, you know.

34
00:01:30,672 --> 00:01:31,922
Do I look good?

35
00:01:34,324 --> 00:01:37,030
In case you don't know,

36
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,890
when I did that What's Happening show,

37
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,940
I weighed 300 pounds
and I was a 54 in the waist.

38
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,015
I have lost 108 pounds
and 18 inches off my waist.

39
00:01:49,065 --> 00:01:52,368
(audience applauding)

40
00:01:52,418 --> 00:01:53,251
- Woo.

41
00:01:55,626 --> 00:01:57,490
And people, when they see me

42
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,170
like in the airport or somewhere,

43
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,870
they're doing these double takes.

44
00:02:02,901 --> 00:02:04,460
Is that Rerun?

45
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,750
And I here these little voices.

46
00:02:05,797 --> 00:02:06,968
"Girl, that ain't him."

47
00:02:07,018 --> 00:02:07,878
"Yeah, that's Rerun."

48
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:08,762
"That ain't him."

49
00:02:08,812 --> 00:02:09,750
"That's Rerun."

50
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,662
"That ain't him."

51
00:02:10,712 --> 00:02:11,495
"That's Rerun."

52
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:14,537
Then they come up and walk
right in my face and they say,

53
00:02:14,587 --> 00:02:18,070
"You know, I've been
watching your show for years.

54
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,900
Are you rerun?"

55
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,558
Well if you been watching
my show for years,

56
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,078
you should know I'm Rerun.

57
00:02:23,128 --> 00:02:23,919
(audience applauding)

58
00:02:23,961 --> 00:02:24,930
What's up with that?

59
00:02:25,848 --> 00:02:26,631
Listen up.

60
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:31,681
We about to bring up
our featured comic tonight.

61
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,310
This young man, I met
him in April of last year

62
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,960
at the Detroit Opera
House in downtown Detroit.

63
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,880
We both appeared together in a play called

64
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,190
Ain't Nothing Like Family.

65
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,600
And when my friend came to me and asked me

66
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,087
who should be headlining this show tonight?

67
00:02:55,137 --> 00:03:00,137
I said, listen, no one other
than Mr. Tony Roberts.

68
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,260
Now listen up.

69
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:07,310

Jam or HBO Def Comedy Jam,

70
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,393

72
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:21,190
for Most Original Comic in 1995.

73
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,420
All the way from Detroit to New York City.

74
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,890
Let's hear it for our star
and headliner tonight.

75
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,993

Thank you. Thank you.

78
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,489
Camera man. Camera man. Camera man.

79
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:48,580
Go ahead camera man, take a shot.

80
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,830
How y'all doing tonight?

81
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,710
Everybody look like they
got jobs, they looking good.

82
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,650
I'm glad I got this gig
'cause I'm broke as hell.

83
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,137
My landlord sent me.

84
00:03:59,187 --> 00:04:02,770
You know you broke when
your landlord get you gigs.

85
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,900
The rent is God damn due.

86
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,190
My landlord mean.

87
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,860
My apartment this big
right here for $800 a month,

88
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,090
right here.

89
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,998
My apartment's so small

90
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,640
my back door and my front
door is on the same hinge.

91
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,608
I stick a key in and stabbed my girlfriend.

92
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,090
I said, "You know you supposed
to duck, you hear me coming."

93
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,973
You know the procedures.

94
00:04:22,082 --> 00:04:23,200
I can't lie.

95
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,263
I can lay in my bed and fry egg.

96
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,480
Everything is right here.

97
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,448
I can get a bigger place.

98
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,930
I got to get a bigger.

99
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,420
From Detroit, man, moved to New York.

100
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,620
New York is unbelievable.

101
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,270
The traffic is Hell.

102
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,640
Whoa. They be bumper to bumper.

103
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,970
I went from Harlem to
Brooklyn, took me a day.

104
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,848
I'm bumper to bumper.

105
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,708
I got so frustrated I put
them (beep) in neutral

106
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,440
and let them push me.

107
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,515
They honking their horn.

108
00:04:48,565 --> 00:04:49,356
Don't honk your horn.

109
00:04:49,398 --> 00:04:50,950
We're going the same way, God dammit.

110
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,390
Just push me.

111
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,340
I'm tired of that frustration, (beep).

112
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,020
And it's cold outside, (beep).

113
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,770
It's been cold in New York, I know that.

114
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,554
And you know, Black people
don't like that cold weather.

115
00:05:01,596 --> 00:05:03,200
White people love cold weather.

116
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,140
You don't see the white weather man?

117
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:05,973
They love it.

118
00:05:06,023 --> 00:05:06,814
"Now for the weather."

119
00:05:06,856 --> 00:05:07,889
"Oh, it's 10 below zero.

120
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:11,020
Wind chill factor 36
below, good skiing weather.

121
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,627
More about this at 10:00."

122
00:05:13,673 --> 00:05:16,397
You don't see black weather
man when it's that cold?

123
00:05:16,447 --> 00:05:17,238
"Now for the weather."

124
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,500
"Oh (beep). It's cold as Hell out there."

125
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,072
Look at this (beep)

126
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,231
Don't you take your (beep) outside.

127
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:25,282
You can't afford it.

128
00:05:25,332 --> 00:05:27,128
You got no AAA, don't go out there.

129
00:05:27,178 --> 00:05:28,104
Do not go out.

130
00:05:28,154 --> 00:05:29,058
Let me write that magic marker.

131
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,963
Don't go outside.

132
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:33,888
If you're tune in tomorrow I'm
gonna have the same (beep) on

133
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,490
'cause I ain't leaving the building.

134
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,590
"Look at this (beep)."

135
00:05:40,624 --> 00:05:41,415
Black people, we know.

136
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:43,630
If it's hot, it's too damn hot.

137
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,040
We ain't never satisfied.

138
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,840
When it's cold, it's too damn cold.

139
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,700
We say stupid (beep).

140
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,080
You ever ask somebody a question

141
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,660
and they give you the same
word twice for an answer?

142
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,777
How the weather feel, bro?

143
00:05:53,827 --> 00:05:55,563
"Well, it ain't like cold, cold"

144
00:05:56,955 --> 00:05:58,870
The hell is cold, cold?

145
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,370
The sweater, the jacket, the coat?

146
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,200
What, man, what?

147
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,360
I went down south did a show in Georgia.

148
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,538
I asked a girl what time it was.

149
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,773
She told me it was 10 minutes to 2:30.

150
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:10,450
I would look at the clock.

151
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,770
I said, "Damn, she's right.
It is 10 minutes to 2:30."

152
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,220
I learn something every day.

153
00:06:18,941 --> 00:06:20,380
People say the wildest (beep).

154
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,940
I'm telling you.

155
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,590
Somebody stole my car in New York.

156
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,918
Living here in New York,
I've been here like a year.

157
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,530
Somebody stole my car already.

158
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,050
My girl, she's spontaneously
just says stupid (beep).

159
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,050
She ain't thinking.

160
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,058
I went in the house mad as hell.

161
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,890
I'm like, "Damn"

162
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,170
She said, "What's wrong, baby?"

163
00:06:34,212 --> 00:06:35,028
I said, "Somebody stole my car."

164
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,117
She said, "Who?"

165
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:39,497
I said, "They leave a note, God dammit."

166
00:06:39,547 --> 00:06:41,057
"They didn't leave a note."

167
00:06:41,107 --> 00:06:43,060
"If you know these people, we better call."

168
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,160
Like she's in on the (beep).

169
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,473
You just got, man.

170
00:06:46,523 --> 00:06:47,600
And ladies, ladies...

171
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,748
What y'all got the heat on, Hell?

172
00:06:50,798 --> 00:06:55,420
What is this Robert
Trio, The Devil's Hotel?

173
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,303
God damn.

174
00:06:57,579 --> 00:07:00,492
Y'all got the heat on
lava rocks in this (beep).

175
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:01,623
It's hot as Hell.

176
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,008
Ladies, look good. You gotta look good.

177
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,380
You gotta keep it together.

178
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,943
'Cause when you're ugly,
you can't have another flaw.

179
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,315
When you ugly you can't
have (beep) else wrong with you

180
00:07:13,357 --> 00:07:15,970

I'd say, "Hold still girl, hold still."

00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,230
I'll blow on it, poof, pop back out.

267
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,050
I said, "We don't need no
hospital, come on over here."

268
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,123
Who love you?

269
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,688

270
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,600
I'm telling you jail is not for everybody.

271
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,420
My mama told me don't
go to jail for nobody.

272
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,560
Don't turn yourself in.

273
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,708
Don't get caught up in nothing.

274
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,730
And I take it to my grave, baby.

275
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,758

If I go to jail, look at me.

277
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,350
If I go to jail, look at me.

278
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,413
I will be on the God damn menu.

279
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,540
They would hit me every night.

280
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,040
Just paste my chest to my knee.

281
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,870
Let me walk around just like this.

282
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,640
'Cause ain't nothing I can do.

283
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,755
If I go to jail that morning,

284
00:10:58,797 --> 00:11:00,970
I'm gonna be somebody's (beep) by 2:00.

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,837
I'd have to change my
name soon as I get in there.

289
00:11:13,887 --> 00:11:15,300
To try and to scare them off me.

290
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,141
They say, "What's your name, punk?"

291
00:11:16,183 --> 00:11:18,537
"I'm Positive, HIV."

292
00:11:19,807 --> 00:11:22,390
"Who wants to hit this (beep), huh?"

293
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,790

297
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,648
(coughing noise)

298
00:11:36,698 --> 00:11:39,043
Who wants to hit this?

299
00:11:39,093 --> 00:11:41,403
I ain't gonna jail for nobody.

300
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,390
Try to make more money.

301
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,740
I'm so scared to go to jail.

302
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,260
I tried to sell weed. Tied to sell weed.

303
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,591
I couldn't do it.

304
00:11:51,641 --> 00:11:53,411
You don't make no money.

305
00:11:53,461 --> 00:11:55,720
I bought $500 worth of this (beep).

306
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:59,020
I flipped every bag, I had $530.

307
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,220
I said, this is (beep).

308
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,920
So I tried to sell crack.

309
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:03,910
Ooh, God.

310
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,080
Let me tell you something.

311
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,270
You gotta be a mathematician
to sell this (beep).

312
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,478
You gotta be able to
add and subtract real fast

313
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:10,968
'cause the crack heads come so fast.

314
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,353
Then they want their change.

315
00:12:12,403 --> 00:12:13,186
You're like,

316
00:12:13,236 --> 00:12:14,610
"Give me $5, give me $5,
give me $10, give me $5"

317
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:16,355
I said, "Man, take this
(beep). I quit. Take it, take it."

318
00:12:16,397 --> 00:12:18,280
"Here, take it."

319
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,183
I'm gonna do me some comedy, go on. Go on.

320
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,240
Take that (beep), I can't handle it.

321
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,618
I try to get people on the
street so much money, man,

322
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,110
'cause I feel sorry.

323
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,725
You can't trust a crack head, oh no.

324
00:12:31,775 --> 00:12:34,090
And crack man...

325
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:38,770
The idea of carjacking is
to take my car and drive off.

326
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,853
That's the idea of it, at night.

327
00:12:40,903 --> 00:12:42,400
A crack head tried to carjack me

328
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,000
in the middle of a traffic jam.

329
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:46,338
4:00 in the afternoon, we bumper to bumper.

330
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,320
He come to my car with a gun.

331
00:12:47,362 --> 00:12:48,145
(knocking noise)

332
00:12:48,195 --> 00:12:48,986
I said, "Oh (beep)."

333
00:12:49,028 --> 00:12:49,833
He had two teeth.

334
00:12:49,883 --> 00:12:51,601
He said, "Get out the car."

335
00:12:51,651 --> 00:12:52,434
I said, "Yo."

336
00:12:52,484 --> 00:12:53,275
He said, "Get out the (beep) car."

337
00:12:53,317 --> 00:12:55,030
So I get out the car, let him in the car.

338
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,780
I'm standing right next to my car.

339
00:12:57,941 --> 00:12:59,324
I said, "This is (beep)."

340
00:12:59,374 --> 00:13:00,165
Every now and then we move up.

341
00:13:00,207 --> 00:13:02,429
I said, "Come on, man. Give me my (beep)."

342
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:05,020
This is bull (beep).

343
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,060
I hate that kind of (beep).

344
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,747
And they'll hustle any kind of money,

345
00:13:08,797 --> 00:13:11,677
any kinda way they can to make some money.

346
00:13:11,727 --> 00:13:13,840
You wouldn't believe it.

347
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,503
I seen a guy with a
big bag of faucet knobs.

348
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,346
He stopped me said,
"Yo bro, you got a sink?"

349
00:13:21,396 --> 00:13:22,179
I said, "Yeah."

350
00:13:22,229 --> 00:13:25,330
He said, "Here, looking
at that, boy. Knobs."

351
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,830
My dumb (beep) trying to find mates.

352
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,360
I'm like this.

353
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,657
All they hell was colds, no hots.

354
00:13:30,707 --> 00:13:34,073
I said, "He ain't got no hots in there?"

355
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,158
I hate that.

356
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,386
Don't hate to go into a public restroom.

357
00:13:38,428 --> 00:13:39,485
You sitting there taking you a nice (beep)

358
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,870
in the public restroom

359
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,580
and they got graffiti all on the walls.

360
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,638
You ain't going no where for 10 minutes,

361
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,790
you might as well read the graffiti.

362
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,705
I read one piece that said,

363
00:13:46,747 --> 00:13:48,618
"If you're reading this
right now you lick balls."

364
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,230
I looked away.

365
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,973
I said, no. No, I don't like no balls.

366
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:56,973
Oh no.

367
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,403
Went and got my haircut.

368
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,350
I love it. Is it nice?

369
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,400
Looking fashionable.

370
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,736
You better watch out.

371
00:14:06,786 --> 00:14:07,569
Yeah brother,

372
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:09,198
you ever been sitting in
the barber chair just chilling.

373
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,980
All of a sudden you for the
barber's groins on your elbows.

374
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,050
You go, "Hey, back up."

375
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,187
He's cutting your hair
like this and (beep).

376
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,136
I just hate that kinda (beep).

377
00:14:19,186 --> 00:14:22,353
(audience applauding)

378
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,860
That's beautiful, that is so beautiful.

379
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,140
The last girl I had, we
were together for two years.

380
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,085
Then she gonna tell me,

381
00:14:30,127 --> 00:14:32,060
"I think I want to see other people."

382
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,030
I said, "(beep), you
better look out the window."

383
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,330
I would kill your (beep)
if I see you with anybody.

384
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,817
"'Cause I'm fatal."

385
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,111
I like this club here.

386
00:14:41,153 --> 00:14:41,944
I did a show in Brooklyn.

387
00:14:41,986 --> 00:14:42,888
I keep going to Brooklyn.

388
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,770
Brooklyn scares me.

389
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,240
It scares me.

390
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,550
I talked about a guy, he got so mad.

391
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,391
I ain't know who he was.

392
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:50,600
He talked about me first.

393
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,693
I talked about my...

394
00:14:52,743 --> 00:14:54,618
When you talk about me
I'm coming in your grill.

395
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,050
I don't care who you are.

396
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,110
I didn't know who this guy was.

397
00:14:57,152 --> 00:14:58,750
I shouldn't have (beep) with him.

398
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,591
He stood up and said,

399
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:01,937
"I'm kicking your after the
show" and walked away.

400
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,180
My dumb (beep) didn't believe him.

401
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,230
I walk out happy as a (beep).

402
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,226
He smacked the (beep)...

403
00:15:09,268 --> 00:15:11,453
You ever been smacked so hard and itch.

404
00:15:11,503 --> 00:15:12,624
He said, "Clap."

405
00:15:12,674 --> 00:15:14,482
I said, "God damn."

406
00:15:14,532 --> 00:15:16,865
"What you hit me with, man?"

407
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,489
'Cause I ain't no fighter.

408
00:15:19,531 --> 00:15:22,450
You ever been smack so hard
you start another conversation.

409
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,940
Like plow, "So anyway
bro, like I was telling you."

410
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,910
I ain't gonna feed off to this (beep).

411
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,410
Is he coming? Take me
with you, take me with you.

412
00:15:30,426 --> 00:15:32,620
"I hope you got a car 'cause..."

413
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,200
One guy hit me so hard I had to play crazy

414
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,670
so he don't hit me again.

415
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,503
He said, "Bam"

416
00:15:37,553 --> 00:15:38,393
I said, "Riverdance."

417
00:15:40,688 --> 00:15:43,150
I said, "Where he at? Where he at?"

418
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,800
I was like this on their (beep).

419
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,820
I ain't no fighter, man.

420
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,772
That's why I don't go to
clubs with women no more.

421
00:15:50,814 --> 00:15:52,660
I'll go with my boys, posse down.

422
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,598
'Cause women get you killed.

423
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,708
I don't know why y'all coupled up now,

424
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,700
that's some (beep).

425
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,230
And knowing I can't fight.

426
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,313
Girl get in the club with
me, she wander off this way.

427
00:16:01,355 --> 00:16:02,410
I don't know where she at.

428
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,492
She over there with
the rough looking (beep).

429
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:07,570
I'm like, "Oh (beep)
she gonna get us killed."

430
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,138
She come over, I'm minding my business.

431
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,045
She gonna tap me on the shoulder.

432
00:16:10,087 --> 00:16:11,200
"Tony, come over here.

433
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,558
This guy talking (beep) to me over here."

434
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,010
I said, "Stay your (beep) over here.

435
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,235
You better dance, girl.

436
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:18,747
Here they come too. You better dance hard."

437
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:22,701
They gonna come check me.

438
00:16:22,751 --> 00:16:23,938
Talkin' about, "You with her?"

439
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,329
I act like I worked there.

440
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:27,017
"Uh-uh, I don't know her (beep)."

441
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:27,858
"Y'all want a drink?"

442
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,700
She gonna get somebody
killed in this (beep).

443
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:32,590
"What y'all having?"

444
00:16:32,632 --> 00:16:33,593
I'm like the waiter.

445
00:16:36,065 --> 00:16:37,570
I don't care, man.

446
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,720
I ain't going to jail.

447
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:42,760
'Cause if I kill somebody,
I'm going to jail.

448
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:43,608
I'm so scared of jail.

449
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,462
I was in court for tickets.

450
00:16:45,512 --> 00:16:46,510
For tickets.

451
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,830
I knew I was going to jail.

452
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,380
I was so nervous I called
the judge Your Highness.

453
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,778
He said, "You understand your allegations

454
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,098
about these tickets Mr. Roberts?"

455
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,998
I said, "Yes, Your Highness."

456
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,823
He said, "What?"

457
00:16:56,873 --> 00:16:58,463
I said, "What?"

458
00:16:58,513 --> 00:17:01,157
I played stupid like somebody
else said that. "What?"

459
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,550
I was so scared.

460
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,945
Little court appointed
attorney gonna tell me,

461
00:17:04,987 --> 00:17:06,044
"It's Your Honor."

462
00:17:06,094 --> 00:17:08,950
I said, "I am honored to
be here, Your Majesty."

463
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,410
Just don't send me
to jail, that's all I ask.

464
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,930
I ain't gonna jail for nobody.

465
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,190
Nobody.

466
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,100
A friend of mine had a gun in the car.

467
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,730
In the car.

468
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,880
Didn't tell me though.

469
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,671
We listening to tapes.

470
00:17:21,713 --> 00:17:24,270
I'm just chilling like, "That's the jam."

471
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,238
He said, "Go and get another tape

472
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,168
out of the glove compartment."

473
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,278
I go in there and see the gun.

474
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,890
Now I'm all messed up.

475
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,840
All my cools just went out the window.

476
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,390
He ran a stop sign.

477
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,770
The police came behind us.

478
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,780
Now I'm about to throw the (beep) up.

479
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,400
I can't go to prison.

480
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,130
My mama said don't go
to jail for nobody, nobody.

481
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,870
All we're gonna get is a ticket.

482
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,670
Now when I'm in that (beep).

483
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,830
I'm scared, I'm thinking about myself.

484
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,105
As soon as the officer
came to the window I said,

485
00:17:49,147 --> 00:17:51,417
"Excuse me officer, the gun ain't mine."

486
00:17:54,103 --> 00:17:54,894
He said, "What gun?"

487
00:17:54,936 --> 00:17:56,477
I said, "The gun right here."

488
00:17:56,527 --> 00:17:59,277
"He brought the gun. I brought the tapes."

489
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,973
Now we in jail and he mad at me.

490
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,759
I said, "So what, punk. I panicked."

491
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,451
Three years ain't (beep.)

492
00:18:07,493 --> 00:18:08,720
We ain't got nothing to do.

493
00:18:09,921 --> 00:18:10,998
Look, he got 10, he ain't crying.

494
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,390
He ain't nuttin' but a hoe.

495
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,823
Life is crazy, man.

496
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,800
You'll be a bum in a minute.

497
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,828
You better keep yourself together.

498
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,800
If you got a good job,
keep yourself a good job.

499
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,210
Keep yourself a good relationship.

500
00:18:25,255 --> 00:18:27,430
It's hard to find a good woman.

501
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,458
They talking about good man.

502
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,400
See men lazy, we're lazy.

503
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,233
We're lazy.

504
00:18:31,283 --> 00:18:32,074
I got a friend asking me,

505
00:18:32,116 --> 00:18:33,708
"Tony, where can I find a girl with a job?"

506
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,680
I said, "At a job, God dammit."

507
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,130
Get the job and meet
her there, you lazy (beep).

508
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,997
"You find her at the job."

509
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,487
A bum gonna try to stop me talking about,

510
00:18:46,537 --> 00:18:47,500
"Well brother man."

511
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,790
Tried to fool me.

512
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,478
Tell me you're a bum,
I'll give you what I got.

513
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,180
What I can afford to give you.

514
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,021
He gonna talk about,

515
00:18:53,063 --> 00:18:54,678
"Brother man, help me with a little change,

516
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,140
help me catch the bus."

517
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,516
I said, "Catch the bus?"

518
00:18:57,566 --> 00:19:00,064
"Where the (beep) do you have to go?

519
00:19:00,114 --> 00:19:04,077
You're here. You going to another store?"

520
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,590
Homeless and hungry,
I don't get that (beep).

521
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,660
If I was homeless, ain't
no way I would be hungry.

522
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:13,360
All them pigeons walking through the park.

523
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,370
Boy, that is breakfast.

524
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:19,039
I'll be behind a building with
a bat waiting on one of them.

525
00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:19,922
Coo, coo.

526
00:19:21,485 --> 00:19:23,823
I will beat the hell out of a pigeon.

527
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,623
I love y'all.

528
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,943
The Devil Hotel.

529
00:19:27,993 --> 00:19:30,070
This is the Devil's Hotel.

530
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,443
My name's Tony Roberts, peace and love.

531
00:19:32,493 --> 00:19:35,660
(audience applauding)

532
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:42,083
- Tony Roberts. Tony Roberts. Tony Roberts.

533
00:19:43,323 --> 00:19:45,929
Thank you so very much,
Tony, again for coming.

534
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:49,160
- I don't want the rose, I want my check.

535
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,460
- Tony Roberts.

536
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,720
All right, you guys are
enjoying yourself so far?

537
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:59,080
Yeah. It's a wonderful evening already.

538
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,230
Listen, I have two friends

539
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,500
who visit here every Wednesday night

540
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,450
and they're at the bar, right?

541
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,940
And sometimes they get into this argument.

542
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,610
Well, last Wednesday night
they got into an argument

543
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,487
and one says, "Listen, I have
more courage than you do."

544
00:20:16,537 --> 00:20:19,150
The other guy says, 'Man, shut up."

545
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,900
He says, "Listen, I have
more courage than you do."

546
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,730
The guy says, "Prove it."

547
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,823
He says, "Okay, bartender."

548
00:20:26,873 --> 00:20:28,217
Bartend said, "Yeah?"

549
00:20:28,267 --> 00:20:30,309
"You see that hatchet
on the wall back there?"

550
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:31,270
He said, "Yeah."

551
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,160
He said, "Bring it over here to the bar."

552
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,061
Bartend takes the hatchet down.

553
00:20:34,103 --> 00:20:35,853
He brings it over to the bar.

554
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,460
He puts his finger on
the bar just like this.

555
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,190
He says, "Bartender, chop my finger off."

556
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,328
Bartender says, "What, you
want me to take this hatchet

557
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,610
and chop your finger off?"

558
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,650
He says, "Yeah, chop it off."

559
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,680
The bartender, womp, chops his finger off.

560
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:54,520
He don't budge, he
don't flinch, he don't move.

561
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:58,237
He looks at the other guy
saying, "Now that's courage."

562
00:20:58,287 --> 00:21:00,400
The other guy said,
"Man, that ain't (beep)."

563
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,150
He puts two fingers up on the bar.

564
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,366
He said, "Bartender?"

565
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,880
Bartender said, "Yeah?"

566
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,620
He said, "Chop my fingers off."

567
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,968
Bartender said, "You want me
to chop both your fingers off?"

568
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,018
He says, "Yeah, chop them off."

569
00:21:13,068 --> 00:21:16,270
The bartend, womp,
chops both his fingers off.

570
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,260
He don't budge, he
don't flinch, he don't move.

571
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:23,915
He looks at the other guy
and says, "Now that's courage."

572
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:27,280
Just at that time, another guy comes up.

573
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,050
He pushes both of them out the way

574
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,933
and puts his penis up on the bar.

575
00:21:34,758 --> 00:21:37,720
Bartend said, "You want
me to chop your penis off?"

576
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,827
He said, "No, I want you to kiss it."

577
00:21:39,877 --> 00:21:41,667
"It'll get off by itself."

578
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:46,466
(audience applauding)

579
00:21:56,195 --> 00:22:00,640
- Oh, we going to have
a good night tonight.

580
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,850
Let's have a really nice round of applause

581
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,197
for Maleta Apogo.

582
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:11,119
(audience applauding)

583
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,290
- Give it up again for Rerun.

584
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,183
Hey now.

585
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,543
Hello there.

586
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,658
No, wait a minute Black people,

587
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,858
I spoke to everyone in the house.

588
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,691
You know you can get loud.

589
00:22:28,733 --> 00:22:30,160
Let's act like you hit the lottery.

590
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,589
Hello there.

591
00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:32,740
(crowd cheering)

592
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,150
Yes, indeed. Yes. Indeed.

593
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,490
As Rerun said, my name is Maleta.

594
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,160
So how's everyone feeling tonight?

595
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,210
Looking good.

596
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,830
Put on your best.

597
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,990
Some of you want your
Sunday best on a Tuesday,

598
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,790
but it's all right.

599
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,613
I'm originally from Philadelphia.

600
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:52,090
City of brotherly love, broken
bottles, and cheese steaks.

601
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,130
How many of you know about Philly?

602
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,000
All right now.

603
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,070
How many of you had a cheese steak?

604
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,320
How many of y'all
brought one for me tonight?

605
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,632
Put your hands down, you're liars.

606
00:23:00,674 --> 00:23:02,253
Every last one of you.

607
00:23:02,303 --> 00:23:03,910
No, but you know what, honestly, though,

608
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,590
I tell you I moved from Philadelphia

609
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,590
because it was just too much
violence in my community.

610
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,773
Now I'm in New York, a nice safe town.

611
00:23:11,854 --> 00:23:15,370
Hey, that's what Giuliani said.

612
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,900
And I believe him.

613
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,213
Believe all white people.

614
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,230
Take it easy.

615
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,194
No seriously though.

616
00:23:21,244 --> 00:23:22,650
Like I said, but the thing,

617
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,810
it was wasn't the street
violence that ran me away.

618
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,280
It was the domestic violence.

619
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,530
I have to share with
you, we look like family.

620
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,021
Every weekend in my home
there was just too much violence.

621
00:23:32,071 --> 00:23:35,110
Violence, violence.

622
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,918
You know, I was so sick
of looking at my mother

623
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,470
kick my father's every weekend.

624
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,193
Stop it, Ma. Stop the violence.

625
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,520
And men, you know, I gotta bond with men.

626
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,200
I ain't into male bashing.

627
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,948
You know, you hate to admit
to your asses being whooped.

628
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:49,930
Isn't it true?

629
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,527
Especially by your woman, right?

630
00:23:51,577 --> 00:23:54,407
"No, man, I got this at a basketball game."

631
00:23:54,457 --> 00:23:56,994
"No woman going hit me, I'm a man."

632
00:23:57,044 --> 00:23:58,694
And it was so embarrassing

633
00:23:58,744 --> 00:24:01,547
because my mother would
get him with that one two punch.

634
00:24:01,597 --> 00:24:02,677
You know the one two punch?

635
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:06,358
The one when she hit
him and he hit the floor?

636
00:24:06,408 --> 00:24:07,897
You know that punch.

637
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,970
And we be out in the
middle of our jacks game,

638
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,905
getting it on and all of a
sudden you hear your mom go,

639
00:24:11,947 --> 00:24:15,107
"Hey y'all, you better
come get your daddy."

640
00:24:15,157 --> 00:24:16,990
"He bleeding all over my kitchen floor

641
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,207
and I ain't having it."

642
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:25,540
And we had to sit in the emergency room

643
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,198
listening to my father babble all night

644
00:24:27,248 --> 00:24:29,650
with his eyes swollen like a grapefruit.

645
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,849
Talking about, "See, your
mama don't know me, see.

646
00:24:32,899 --> 00:24:36,370
What she did is she
snuck around and hit me.

647
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,380
She didn't come in the front.

648
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:42,447
Cause if she done hit me,
I'd have hit her like a man."

649
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,815
And that eight years old I'm thinking,

650
00:24:44,857 --> 00:24:47,337
"Yeah, Mr. Punk (beep) jellyfish."

651
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,058
Wish he'd take a karate class or something.

652
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,751
You know what I'm talking about?

653
00:24:51,801 --> 00:24:52,840
Defend yourself.

654
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,550
Work it out, Daddy, work it out.

655
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,840
Issues.

656
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,510
No, but I'm proud to say, talk
to my mother the other day.

657
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,920
She is now reformed.

658
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,420
She's no longer into violence.

659
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,491
Yay mom.

660
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:03,332
(audience applauding)

661
00:25:03,374 --> 00:25:04,207
Yeah, mom.

662
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:08,980
She's now into physical fitness.

663
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,150
Like there's a difference.

664
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,568
Have you ever taken aerobics class?

665
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,300
Violent.

666
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,988
She called me the other
day, she's all excited.

667
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,135
She lost two pounds talking about some,

668
00:25:16,177 --> 00:25:19,840
"Maleta, girl, you need to get into shape."

669
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:22,900
And I said to her, "Mom, I
thought round was a shape."

670
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,190
Correct me if I'm wrong.

671
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,073
Square, round.

672
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,710
But you know, now Black
folk, don't we love our mother?

673
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,118
You love your mother.

674
00:25:34,168 --> 00:25:35,730
Yeah.

675
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,130
So you gotta follow what she says.

676
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,770
So I listened to mom, I
joined Living Well Lady.

677
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,420
You know the fitness center?

678
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,261
The cheap (beep) fitness center.

679
00:25:44,303 --> 00:25:45,588
Don't try and act like you don't know

680
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:48,310
what I'm talking about, I seen your faces.

681
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,698
But see, one thing I wanna tell you

682
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,640
about the Living Well Lady Center

683
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,590
is that they have two versions.

684
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,040
There's the uptown version
and the downtown version.

685
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,920
Let me tell you a little bit
about the downtown version.

686
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:01,210
The downtown version

687
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,700
is where all the little thin white women go

688
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,603
to have an aerobics class
instead of a sandwich.

689
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,000
Get the (beep) out of here.

690
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:15,580
And you know they got the
best of everything downtown.

691
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,500
You know how they keep it downtown.

692
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,338
And I stepped in there,
you know they looked at me

693
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,210
as if I had in interrupted
a Ku Klux Klan rally.

694
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,210
You know that look?

695
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,457
I said, "Excuse me. Look here, look here."

696
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:33,747
"Look at the body, y'all I belong here."

697
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,290
Now as I said,

698
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,690
you know they got the
state of the art everything,

699
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,400
and I love everything because of that.

700
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,578
But I tell you just one little thing

701
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,688
that kind of annoys me down there.

702
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,510
I gotta share with you 'cause we're family.

703
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,400
It's the skinny women.

704
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,190
Skinny women.

705
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,311
(Maleta growling)

706
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:57,040
Walking around the gym in
those French cut body suits.

707
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:57,940
You know the ones?

708
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,633
The ones that cut the cheek just so.

709
00:27:05,273 --> 00:27:08,770
Well those skinny girls
weren't gonna outdo me.

710
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,923
So I went out and I bought me one.

711
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,950
Honey, I stepped up on the Stair Master.

712
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,850
Woo, there it is.

713
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:24,243
I had to have that
thing surgically removed.

714
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,220
Oh Lord, the French cuts you deep, baby.

715
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,670
I'm working with that broad British cut.

716
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,680
Forget that no pain, no gain concept.

717
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,420
I'm not down with it.

718
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,400
Now, I told you there's an uptown version

719
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,630
of Living Well Lady.

720
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,628
Let me just share that with you,

721
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,738
'cause you're gonna love this.

722
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,423
All of the women uptown look like me.

723
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,300
And we position our
bikes right at the window

724
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,740
so we can make that decision.

725
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,986
Should we go to Kentucky
Fried or should we go to Wendy's?

726
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:53,340
Kentucky Fried or Wendy's?

727
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,430
Kentucky Fried or Wendy's?

728
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,498
Oh, what the hell is a hot day.

729
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,133
Let's just do Baskin Robbins.

730
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,310
And you know we don't go to exercise.

731
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,260
We go to socialize.

732
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,198
When you walk in that gym

733
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,465
slap that bicycle seat and say,

734
00:28:07,507 --> 00:28:09,407
"Not today, girlfriend, how you been?"

735
00:28:10,734 --> 00:28:13,492
Sometime might go use the
bathroom, you know how it works.

736
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:16,173
That's what the lifetime membership is for.

737
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,960
Always need a place to pee, don't you?

738
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,338
No, but seriously though,

739
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,680
when you're like me,

740
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:25,256
and for those of you don't know who I am,

741
00:28:25,298 --> 00:28:28,000
I'm dietarily challenged.

742
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,650
Can you go to Kentucky Fried or Wendy's?

743
00:28:29,693 --> 00:28:31,120
No, but seriously though,

744
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,400
for some reason you
always seem to meet the men

745
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,232
with zero stamped on their forehead.

746
00:28:35,282 --> 00:28:38,350
Like the other day I'm
walking down Broadway.

747
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,370
Man comes up to me no
teeth in the front of his mouth.

748
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,590
Hair all over his head.

749
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,323
One leg shorter than the other.

750
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,570
Name was Buster.

751
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,230
What a name, what a catch.

752
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,805
He comes walking up
to me talking about some,

753
00:28:54,847 --> 00:28:57,190
"Hey, big girl."

754
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,023
He talking about,

755
00:28:58,073 --> 00:29:00,513
"Something with you,
something wrong with me, huh?"

756
00:29:10,093 --> 00:29:11,211
He talking about some,

757
00:29:11,261 --> 00:29:15,010
"I know a lot of guys
don't step to you like I do."

758
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,120
"Get it? Step to you like I do."

759
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,626
He said, "But I gotta look at
you, big mamma and I tell you,

760
00:29:22,676 --> 00:29:26,650
you definitely are my kind of woman."

761
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,140
And I looked at him
with all 32 teeth showing

762
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,673
and those bedroom eyes and I said,

763
00:29:32,723 --> 00:29:34,480
"How do you know I'm a woman?"

764
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,988
He said, "Oh my God, this is New York City,

765
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,730
Let me get my (beep) out of here."

766
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,360
Woo, you better take the
crotch baby, in New York.

767
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,640
Drag queen city.

768
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,163
No, but seriously.

769
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,238
Now y'all know where
voice that is, stop it now.

770
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,217
That's that bill
collector's voice, ain't it?

771
00:29:55,267 --> 00:29:56,587
"Can I speak to Maleta Apogo?"

772
00:29:56,637 --> 00:29:57,717
"She ain't here."

773
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,800
Oh, pretend you don't know?

774
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:05,327
Put the kids on the phone, I ain't stupid.

775
00:30:05,377 --> 00:30:06,327
"Daddy ain't here."

776
00:30:07,537 --> 00:30:08,320
"Your parents?"

777
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,660
"Nadda dabba doo."

778
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,340
Oh, I'm not the only one,
thanks for connecting.

779
00:30:17,188 --> 00:30:18,490
"Daddy died."

780
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,373
No he...

781
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,297
"We're at the funeral now."

782
00:30:23,347 --> 00:30:25,153
"Ain't that right, Daddy, oh."

783
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,223
All Black folk, work with me.

784
00:30:32,048 --> 00:30:35,215
(audience applauding)

785
00:30:36,638 --> 00:30:39,055
It ain't easy, it ain't easy.

786
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,353
It ain't easy being cheesy,
thank you for applauding.

787
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:45,348
You know seriously though.

788
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:47,273
I tell you, people pass judgment on you.

789
00:30:47,323 --> 00:30:49,834
They look at you when
you're dietarily challenged.

790
00:30:49,884 --> 00:30:50,948
You know what I'm talking about, right?

791
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,458
For those who are dietarily challenged.

792
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,000
And they don't know anything about you.

793
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,958
Right away they look at
you say, "They eat too much."

794
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,671
That's the first thing, right?

795
00:30:58,721 --> 00:30:59,718
I ain't (beep) all night.

796
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,330
Did you see me eat anything?

797
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,610
I'm hungry as (beep), don't nobody know it.

798
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,230
I can't get food stamps.

799
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,113
Anyway, no.

800
00:31:10,347 --> 00:31:12,183
And I thought you loved me.

801
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:14,664
No, but seriously though,

802
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,068
for those of you who don't know it,

803
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,500
I went to the doctor.

804
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,683
And I found out I had a medical condition.

805
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,313
Found out I had an eating disorder.

806
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,060
I just keep eating disorder,
that order, that order.

807
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,900
I saw a plate of food pass by.

808
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,063
Did you see anything?

809
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:37,376
I thought I saw something, just checking.

810
00:31:39,183 --> 00:31:40,929
♪ The clean up woman ♪

811
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:41,762
Where's that plate?

812
00:31:41,812 --> 00:31:45,937
♪ Is the woman who ♪

813
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,160
♪ Take all the chicken
wings you leave behind ♪

814
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,830
Anyway, that's my other career.

815
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,738
No, but seriously though.

816
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,763
People, like I said, pass judgment on you.

817
00:31:53,813 --> 00:31:56,830
And you know, women, won't
we do some things for a man?

818
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,690
If we love our man, we do sacrifice.

819
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,890
Isn't that true?

820
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,177
Two years ago, my husband told me,

821
00:32:02,227 --> 00:32:04,870
"Baby, you got to lose
some weight. I can't take it."

822
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,910
So two years ago for the love of the man,

823
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,273
I lost 145 pounds.

824
00:32:09,323 --> 00:32:10,349
Thank you.

825
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,190
(audience applauding)

826
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,758
That's right. I kicked my husband's (beep)

827
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,710
right out the house.

828
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,943
145 got to go.

829
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,803
I'm looking good, feeling thin.

830
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:24,453
You got a man?

831
00:32:24,503 --> 00:32:25,286
How much he weigh?

832
00:32:25,336 --> 00:32:26,950
Boom, out the door.

833
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,978
Ain't got to deal with that.

834
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,190
I pay the cost to be the boss.

835
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,031
All right, I like the...

836
00:32:31,073 --> 00:32:33,520
You got that look I love.

837
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,658
He's shaking his like a
minister, like I'm in church.

838
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,533
He go, "Mm Hmm"

839
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,856
Thank you so much.

840
00:32:41,906 --> 00:32:45,073
(audience applauding)

841
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:47,660
- Maleta Apogo. Maleta Apogo.

842
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,100
Wow. Maleta Apogo.

843
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,101
How nice. We're having such fun tonight.

844
00:33:00,151 --> 00:33:02,830
I don't know about you
guys, but I am having a ball.

845
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,420
I'm just sitting over here.

846
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:08,290
I'm crying over here, they're
making me laugh so much.

847
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,660
But listen all of you have seen me,

848
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,460
or most of you have seen me

849
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:16,240
on the What's Happening
TV series, am I correct?

850
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,073
Am I correct?

851
00:33:17,123 --> 00:33:18,992
You've seen me in the
What's Happening show.

852
00:33:19,042 --> 00:33:20,119
(audience applauding)

853
00:33:20,169 --> 00:33:24,460
But listen, I was not
always in show business.

854
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:27,190
I'm also an investment banker.

855
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:32,171
And I remember one night I
was invited, me and my wife,

856
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:33,640
that's when I was married.

857
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:37,450
Me and my wife were
invited to my boss's house

858
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,630
for a dinner party one Saturday night.

859
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,790
So we go and we are having a good time

860
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,760
and I start drinking and I get drunk.

861
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,920
I curse my boss out.

862
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:52,893
I knock over everything
on the table and he fires me.

863
00:33:53,738 --> 00:33:55,787
Well, the next morning I wake up, I say,

864
00:33:55,837 --> 00:34:00,490
"Dear, did I do anything
crazy at the party last night?"

865
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,347
My wife said, "Did you do anything crazy?"

866
00:34:03,397 --> 00:34:05,500
"You ate everything, you got drunk,

867
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:09,550
you cursed your boss
out, and he fired you."

868
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,237
I said, "What? He fired me?"

869
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,760
She said, "Yeah, he fired you."

870
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,980
I said, "Oh, screw him."

871
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:20,730
She said, "I already did.
You go back to work Monday."

872
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:24,820
(audience applauding)

873
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:29,433
Let's have a nice round of
applause for Sara Contreras.

874
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:34,120
(audience applauding)

875
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,693
- I want more love than that, God dammit.

876
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,655
Because I will bring my family in here

877
00:34:44,697 --> 00:34:45,947
and this (beep) place up.

878
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:53,980
How you doing?

879
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,293
Yes, I'm a Latina.

880
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:59,350
Where are you, my people?

881
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,887
Everybody in the kitchen
is like, "Represent."

882
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,810
And you know Puerto Ricans are cool

883
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,780
'cause we speak Spanish, we speak English,

884
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:13,083
and we make up some (beep) along the way.

885
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,270
Have you heard this?

886
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,210
Anybody who's never heard Spanglish.

887
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,071
Okay, I'm gonna tell
you it usually kicks up

888
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:23,860
when we find out that we
have to work late on payday

889
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:26,080
and we have plans to go dancing.

890
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,102
We're like, "No, no, no.
Let me tell you something"

891
00:35:28,144 --> 00:35:29,628
"Do I look like I'm a
supervisor, that's a (beep)

892
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,257
over time on payday."

893
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:36,048
Now, I was raised in a really,
really rough neighborhood

894
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,930
in Brooklyn and it cracks me up

895
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,720
because right now I'm
raising two kids up in Jersey

896
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:43,540
and their experience is
real different from what I had.

897
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,640
And I have this little eight year old

898
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:48,580
Latina valley home girl.

899
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:52,630
She's got this Def Jam
90210 thing going on.

900
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,157
I take her onto the
playground and she's like,

901
00:35:55,207 --> 00:35:59,907
"Dusty jungle gym? Yo,
mother, I don't think so."

902
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,940
I'm like, "Hold up.

903
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:07,030
You're complaining because
the equipment is dusty dirty?

904
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,928
Let me tell you about
the equipment in Brooklyn

905
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:12,567
growing up, it was missing."

906
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,020
That gym was vandalized all the time, okay.

907
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:21,040
It got to the point where
the housing authority

908
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,750
had to put security on it.

909
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,348
Now, you know, you live
in a (beep) neighborhood

910
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,013
when your swings have a Lo Jack.

911
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,050
I mean my kids in the suburbs,

912
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,630
at night they might hear crickets and owls.

913
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,811
When I was a kid, I used to hear,

914
00:36:35,853 --> 00:36:39,867
"Protected by VIPA, step
away from the sandbox."

915
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:42,563
Thank you.

916
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,100
Yeah, so anyway.

917
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:48,700
I did, I grew up in a yeah, it
was a rough neighborhood.

918
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,478
But I tell you the one
thing, my mother was tough.

919
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,080
I gotta give it up to like Latin
and African American moms.

920
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,550
They tough as (beep).

921
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,110
My mother was a great role model.

922
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,870
She was the type of
woman that was resourceful.

923
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,558
One day we were walking
home from the A and P,

924
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,990
this is a true story.

925
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,200
We're walking home from
the A and P and this little punk

926
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,960
thinks that he's gonna mug my mother.

927
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:10,510
I watched her beat
the (beep) outta this kid

928
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,383
with a loaf of Wonder bread.

929
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,420
That's resourceful, okay.

930
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,050
Then she chases after
the kid when he runs away

931
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,557
and she's running after him,

932
00:37:24,607 --> 00:37:27,553
"Mira, I'm gonna tell your mother, (beep).

933
00:37:28,491 --> 00:37:31,074
Because I know her from bingo."

934
00:37:35,549 --> 00:37:36,983
So it was rough, I grew up.

935
00:37:37,033 --> 00:37:39,160
I got outta there okay.

936
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:41,020
I decided I was gonna go to college

937
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,580
and I was gonna get an education.

938
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,990
My husband and I had this dream

939
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,720
about establishing an all Latino law firm.

940
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:47,561
That'd be cool, right?

941
00:37:47,603 --> 00:37:50,950
And we were gonna, in the
spirit of affirmative action,

942
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,550
hire one token white partner, right.

943
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,100
And we were gonna hire
my mom to work the office.

944
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,500
This would've been my
mother answering the phone.

945
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,150
She would've been like, "Ah-lo?"

946
00:38:02,737 --> 00:38:05,451
"You have reached the law
offices of Contreras, Contreras,

947
00:38:05,501 --> 00:38:08,793
Quintonita, Lopes, Rodriguez, and Jones.

948
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:14,060
What happened to you? He hit you?

949
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,918
Oh no, no, mamita. You
don't need an attorney.

950
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,360
You need to kick his (beep).

951
00:38:18,724 --> 00:38:19,990
"Good luck."

952
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,831
That would've been her.

953
00:38:20,873 --> 00:38:21,664
But you know what, I didn't do that.

954
00:38:21,706 --> 00:38:24,670
I decided I was gonna go
into speech therapy, okay.

955
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,370
A little Puerto Rican
teaching people how to talk.

956
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,384
And I went to Brooklyn College.

957
00:38:28,426 --> 00:38:31,240
Which is kind of like a
contradiction in terms.

958
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:34,690
I went to Brooklyn College
to learn voice and diction.

959
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,150
You do know how they
talk in Brooklyn, right?

960
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,898
I remember the first
day I showed up in class.

961
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,650
I was like, "Is this
voice and diction 101?"

962
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,217
The teacher was like, "(beep) A."

963
00:38:47,167 --> 00:38:48,667
I like this class.

964
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,873
I'm gonna get an A.

965
00:38:52,737 --> 00:38:54,430
And I went into speech therapy.

966
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,728
And I remember that one of the things

967
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:58,480
I used to find really tickling
was every once in a while

968
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,910
I would have a parent teacher conference

969
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,658
and I would get this mother walking into me

970
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,407
and she would be like, "Oh, excuse me."

971
00:39:06,457 --> 00:39:09,460
"I won't like you to tell me
how I could help my son

972
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,097
'cause he talk so funny."

973
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,187
I was like, "You wanna help him?"

974
00:39:18,487 --> 00:39:20,337
"Learn sign language, mama."

975
00:39:21,217 --> 00:39:24,167
"And don't talk to him anymore
'cause you are the problem."

976
00:39:25,337 --> 00:39:28,180
I'm saying, right?

977
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,747
So I live up in Jersey and
I told you about my kids.

978
00:39:30,797 --> 00:39:32,463
They're a trip.

979
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:36,010
I moved up here with my husband,

980
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,720
but we're getting a divorce.

981
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:41,020
Like I said, I'm Puerto Rican
and I married a Dominican.

982
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,678
Now, if anybody knows anything about that,

983
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,200
they're not supposed to mix.

984
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,650
Look she's shaking her head.

985
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,618
I don't know why it is,
but we not supposed to.

986
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,990
But you know what the thing was,

987
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,498
back then I took a lot of flack for it.

988
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,823
But see, we met each other's needs.

989
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:57,183
I needed five grand,
he needed a green card.

990
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,773
Worked for me.

991
00:40:05,326 --> 00:40:06,117
Hey, I'll never forget.

992
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:07,188
That (beep) was romantic too.

993
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,610
The judge was like,
oh he was there with us.

994
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,077
He was like, "Repeat after me."

995
00:40:12,127 --> 00:40:14,560
"Do you Sara vow to live with this man

996
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,917
for two years to establish residency?"

997
00:40:18,007 --> 00:40:18,840
"I do."

998
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:21,828
He was like, "You may not kiss the bride."

999
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:24,120
I'm like, "(beep) that.
Pay the bride, Papa."

1000
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,370
I'm only kidding.

1001
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,698
Actually, I'm getting a divorce.

1002
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,740
It didn't work out.

1003
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:32,557
I am getting a divorce and
we're having this big beef now,

1004
00:40:32,607 --> 00:40:34,210
me and my husband, my ex.

1005
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,920
Because see, I wanna teach
my son that sex is love, okay.

1006
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,690
And he's real macho.

1007
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,880
So we kind of disagree on
how we're teaching our son.

1008
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:44,305
I will sit my boy down and I'm like,

1009
00:40:44,347 --> 00:40:48,007
"Papa, good sex, it starts here."

1010
00:40:48,057 --> 00:40:50,110
And he's like, "Yeah,
that's what daddy said.

1011
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,060
Daddy said, I'm right
handed go for her left titty first."

1012
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:06,903
Parenting in the 90s.

1013
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,115
And lately this (beep) with Clinton.

1014
00:41:12,165 --> 00:41:13,720
Okay.

1015
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,633
He came home the other day,

1016
00:41:16,477 --> 00:41:19,707
"Ma, according to the President."

1017
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:23,200
I was like, "According
to the president, what?"

1018
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,527
He's like,

1019
00:41:24,577 --> 00:41:27,717
"As long as she's going down
on me, I'm not having sex."

1020
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,007
I was like Papa, in this
house if your (beep) is out

1021
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:36,903
and you are not washing
or peeing, you're having sex.

1022
00:41:38,449 --> 00:41:41,950
Don't try that (beep) with me, uh-uh.

1023
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,860
So I started dating
again, which is a total trip.

1024
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:47,170
I don't know ladies, has
this ever happened to you?

1025
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:50,440
You meet a guy at the club first date out.

1026
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:51,850
You're sitting at the table

1027
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,298
and you're trying to make conversation.

1028
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:58,340
And you're like, "Oh my God,
he's (beep) so ugly. Woo."

1029
00:42:01,985 --> 00:42:06,985
"Damn, woo, what up with those teeth?"

1030
00:42:08,687 --> 00:42:11,553
"Was I thinking, dammit
what was I drinking?"

1031
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,877
I hate that (beep).

1032
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,990
They stand in the shadows at the club,

1033
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,090
don't let you see how damn ugly they are.

1034
00:42:28,424 --> 00:42:29,320
I hate that.

1035
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:30,663
See, and I won't stay.

1036
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,680
You know I won't stay.

1037
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:34,217
And fellas, I'm gonna tell you something.

1038
00:42:34,259 --> 00:42:36,907
You ugly ones know who you are.

1039
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:40,960
'Cause you got away with this all the time.

1040
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:42,005
This how you know we don't like you.

1041
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:44,440
'Cause when we're walking into the club

1042
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:46,450
and we like you, you'll see that (beep).

1043
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,730
Especially if she's Latina.

1044
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,028
She's gonna use that special word

1045
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,790
that lets you know she likes you.

1046
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,005
She walking into the restaurant.

1047
00:42:53,047 --> 00:42:55,407
"Damn, I hope he's as
fine as I remember him."

1048
00:42:56,437 --> 00:42:58,213
"Hey, how you doing? Boo."

1049
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,980
"Hi Boo."

1050
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:05,410
Then we get real stupid, "Let's go, Boo."

1051
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,810
'Cause we're happy he's cute.

1052
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:11,470
But if we don't like you, you
ain't getting a Boo out of us.

1053
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,303
We're like,

1054
00:43:12,353 --> 00:43:14,193
"Damn, I hope he's as
fine as I remember him."

1055
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,657
"Damn. Woo."

1056
00:43:35,126 --> 00:43:36,740
How you doing, you?

1057
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:44,980
Listen, I gotta go

1058
00:43:46,348 --> 00:43:49,413
'cause I left my mother watching the kids.

1059
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,390
Oh I didn't tell you I had kids?

1060
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,453
I got like five of them, okay.

1061
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:58,270
I got five of them (beep), okay.

1062
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,363
And three of them are in Special Ed.

1063
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:08,673
Why? 'Cause I did crack
when I was pregnant.

1064
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,613
Oh, I didn't tell you I was a crack head?

1065
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,477
"Where you going, baby?"

1066
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,813
So pay attention.

1067
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,320
Thank you.

1068
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:24,962
(audience applauding)

1069
00:44:25,012 --> 00:44:27,117
Thank you.

1070
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:28,473
I tell you one thing,

1071
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:31,390
something very interesting
happened to me recently

1072
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,530
and I gotta share this

1073
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,110
'cause I think we all
want to be family here.

1074
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,520
I was walking with my boyfriend.

1075
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:40,510
I started dating someone
recently and the sister,

1076
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,310
'cause he's African American,

1077
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,717
I heard her and she was like,

1078
00:44:43,767 --> 00:44:46,677
"I hate when white women take our men."

1079
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,620
And I said, "Oh, I'm
sorry Ma, I'm with that.

1080
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:52,390
I'm definitely with that but I'm not white,

1081
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,320
see I'm Puerto Rican so
I got some African in me.

1082
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:58,560
Three, four, five times a week now."

1083
00:45:00,047 --> 00:45:00,647
Woo.

1084
00:45:09,597 --> 00:45:11,827
Let's clear that (beep) up right now.

1085
00:45:17,327 --> 00:45:19,330
My boo-boo is good to me too.

1086
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,680
He's trying to hook me up.

1087
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:22,120
He's good to me, let me tell you.

1088
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:25,030
I remember the first
time we made love, woo.

1089
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,770
He just rocked my world.

1090
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:29,680
Next morning he's like with an attitude.

1091
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:31,750
I was like, "Baby, what's wrong?"

1092
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,750
He's like, "Yo, when
you with me, you with me.

1093
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,420
I don't give a (beep)
who this Papi Chulo cat is,

1094
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:39,779
You don't bring his name up in my bed."

1095
00:45:39,829 --> 00:45:43,220
I'm like, "Yo Papa, that's
you. You my Papi Chulo."

1096
00:45:44,223 --> 00:45:46,510
Have anybody ever been
with a Spanish woman?

1097
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,903
Aye, Papi. Aye, Papi Chulo.

1098
00:45:50,152 --> 00:45:53,069
(speaking Spanish)

1099
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:59,080
He'd never heard that.

1100
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:01,870
And he was trying to hook me up.

1101
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,180
Trying to buy me some Victoria's Secret.

1102
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:05,020
See, the secret is,

1103
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:08,050
is that it's not made for
little Puerto Rican women.

1104
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,683
He bought me a teddie,
the crotch was down to here.

1105
00:46:11,952 --> 00:46:15,423
He bought me some thongs,
the waistband was up to here.

1106
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:19,090
I told him to get me a pair
of them long hoochie boots.

1107
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:19,931
They came up to here.

1108
00:46:19,973 --> 00:46:21,900
I looked like I was going bass fishing.

1109
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,950
Then I went out with
this young cat recently.

1110
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,630
Let me see, there was a guy here.

1111
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,970
Right there in the red shirt.

1112
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,594
Look at him right there.

1113
00:46:31,644 --> 00:46:32,440
Look at that face.

1114
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:34,720
I got set up on a blind date with a...

1115
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:36,277
I'm up there in the years, you know.

1116
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:37,638
And they set me up with a little...

1117
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,256
Look at you, don't turn away.

1118
00:46:39,306 --> 00:46:42,400
You right there. Look at his face.

1119
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:43,720
My age and him.

1120
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:46,347
Does that face not scream, "Teach me."

1121
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,068
Can you picture me in
bed with that boy right there.

1122
00:46:57,118 --> 00:46:59,418
You I'm not cool with that,
just like, 'cause you're young.

1123
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:03,346
I'm on all fours and he's
like, "What's my name?"

1124
00:47:03,396 --> 00:47:06,146
"What's my name, Mrs. Contreras?"

1125
00:47:10,447 --> 00:47:13,560
"Junior, I will (beep)
you up, you hit me again."

1126
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,290
I went out with this guy recently.

1127
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,690
I gotta tell you about this
one last date before I go.

1128
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,318
I went out on a day recently with this cat.

1129
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,440
I'm not gonna tell you what he was

1130
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:31,480
'cause I'm politically correct.

1131
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:32,748
I'm gonna let you figure it out.

1132
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:34,840
He's like, "You know, I really like you."

1133
00:47:35,857 --> 00:47:37,934
"I would really love to meet your family."

1134
00:47:37,984 --> 00:47:38,807
I was like,

1135
00:47:38,857 --> 00:47:41,058
"That's cool, 'cause I got
a brother out on the island."

1136
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,950
So I took him out to Rikers
Island Correctional Facility.

1137
00:47:49,746 --> 00:47:51,453
That's where my brother lives.

1138
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:57,550
You know, anybody ever drive out there?

1139
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,560
Oh my God, right?

1140
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,210
You take that bus ride out there

1141
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,328
with all them people that go...

1142
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:04,000
Don't they look like they just escaped

1143
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:05,687
and they're going back for their (beep)?

1144
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:10,870
I hate that.

1145
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,318
So see, I don't like going out there.

1146
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,320
And I got this idea.

1147
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:17,830
I got this plan for
developing greeting cards

1148
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,630
just for the convicted.

1149
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,060
Yo, there's money to be made here, Papa.

1150
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:23,740
Okay, see I'd rather be on a blind date

1151
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:25,952
with big old daddy here.

1152
00:48:26,002 --> 00:48:28,773
It's about 25 good
years good loving, right?

1153
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:33,490
My idea is you walk into the stores

1154
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,440
and the sections will be clearly marked.

1155
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:38,800
It will be like birthday, anniversary,

1156
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:41,620
Passover, lockdown.

1157
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:43,038
And you know when you're
looking for the right card,

1158
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,320
you get real sentimental.

1159
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:47,553
You'll be like, "Oh, look."

1160
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,690
Convicted but not forgotten. Aww.

1161
00:48:54,949 --> 00:48:57,773
"That's so sweet."

1162
00:48:57,823 --> 00:49:00,220
And you could have like a
special invitation card made up.

1163
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,247
It would be like,

1164
00:49:01,297 --> 00:49:04,420
"Mr. and Mrs. Santiago
are pleased to announce

1165
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:06,573
the parole of their son Ray Ray.

1166
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,940
Reception to follow at the McDonald's

1167
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:12,843
on 179th and Grand Concourse.

1168
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,810
No hoodies, no knives,

1169
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:19,287
"we'd like Ray Ray to
make parole this time."

1170
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:21,258
And this one would have to be

1171
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,880
the most popular card in
the series, the most popular.

1172
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:26,980
And you know how sometimes
when you pop open a card

1173
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,630
it has like a little tune?

1174
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,460
This one would have a voice.

1175
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:32,290
And this is how the car would sound.

1176
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:36,693
It would be like, "To my Boo in lockdown."

1177
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:43,790
From my pen to the state
pen. I'm thinking of you, Boo.

1178
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:51,543
Your gangster style. Your go-to smile.

1179
00:49:52,688 --> 00:49:54,688
I know you miss my fufu.

1180
00:49:59,836 --> 00:50:03,093
But 12 years is a long
time for me to remain true.

1181
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:08,800
So I'll be kicking it
with your brother, Mike

1182
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:10,347
"but I'll be thinking of you."

1183
00:50:11,989 --> 00:50:12,772
That's my time.

1184
00:50:12,822 --> 00:50:14,368
Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen.

1185
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:17,577
(audience applauding)

1186
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:22,667
- Sara Contreras. Sara Contreras.

1187
00:50:26,399 --> 00:50:29,260
Listen, I haven't had a
chance to dance tonight.

1188
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:30,760
What's up with that?

1189
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:32,920
Y'all know everywhere I got to dance.

1190
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:33,820
Ain't that right?

1191
00:50:34,966 --> 00:50:36,190
Ain't that right?

1192
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,440
Y'all don't wanna see me dance, do you?

1193
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:41,156
Y'all don't wanna see me dance, do you?

1194
00:50:41,206 --> 00:50:42,539
Make some noise.

1195
00:50:43,896 --> 00:50:47,440
Do we have any music or do
we have to make our own music?

1196
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:48,613
We gotta make our own music?

1197
00:50:48,663 --> 00:50:50,746
Give me the claps, y'all.

1198
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:54,232
Come on, get a beat, come on.

1199
00:50:54,282 --> 00:50:56,808
(audience clapping)

1200
00:50:56,858 --> 00:50:57,933
Yeah, come on now.

1201
00:50:59,104 --> 00:51:04,104
- [Audience Members] Go ahead, go ahead.

1202
00:51:12,548 --> 00:51:15,513
Thank you so very, very much.

1203
00:51:15,563 --> 00:51:19,413
Hey did y'all notice that
I've lost a few pounds?

1204
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:24,063
Yeah, I've lost 108 pounds
and 18 inches on my waist.

1205
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,072
People look at me and
they do a double take.

1206
00:51:27,122 --> 00:51:28,216
They come to me and say,

1207
00:51:28,266 --> 00:51:30,843
"Rerun, what happened,
how'd you lose the weight?

1208
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,340
Was it Slim Fast?"

1209
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,237
Well, I tried slim fast.

1210
00:51:35,287 --> 00:51:37,510
"Was it Opti Fast?"

1211
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,437
I tried Opti Fast.

1212
00:51:39,487 --> 00:51:41,140
"Was it Oprah Winfrey?"

1213
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:43,150
I even tried Oprah Winfrey.

1214
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,730
I tried the grapefruit pill.

1215
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:46,818
Remember the grapefruit pill

1216
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:49,120
that's supposed to melt
the fat in your stomach?

1217
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:51,640
I even tried Sleep-Away.

1218
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:56,620
Lose weight while you sleep for $19.95.

1219
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:59,053
Y'all know what I lost while I slept?

1220
00:51:59,103 --> 00:51:59,936
$19.95.

1221
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:05,350
Okay, this is a young lady
by the name of Janine Rose.

1222
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,030
She has performed in comedy clubs

1223
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,090
throughout New York and New Jersey.

1224
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:14,260
Including the New York Comedy
Club, Boston Comedy Club,

1225
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:17,398
and recently seen at Newark's Comedy Relief

1226
00:52:17,448 --> 00:52:19,660
all-women's show.

1227
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:21,906
Let's have a warm round of applause

1228
00:52:21,956 --> 00:52:26,013
for none other than Janine Rose.

1229
00:52:26,892 --> 00:52:30,059
(audience applauding)

1230
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:33,440
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1231
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:38,560
I hope you guys don't mind
if I make myself comfortable.

1232
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:40,660
Do you mind if I make myself?

1233
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:42,033
Okay, hold on one second.

1234
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:50,920
Well, I kind of brought
something from home, you know.

1235
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:52,810
It's kind of like a security blanket.

1236
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:54,190
Something to make me comfortable.

1237
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:58,150
Something that I feel that, excuse me,

1238
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:02,140
that I feel that every woman
should have in her repertoire.

1239
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:04,250
Give me a moment, I will...

1240
00:53:05,286 --> 00:53:07,803
A set of steel balls.

1241
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:11,980
Now I know generally, you know a man,

1242
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:13,972
you see a woman with
some balls in her hand.

1243
00:53:14,022 --> 00:53:17,140
You check in, initially.

1244
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:19,510
But I don't want you to feel uncomfortable

1245
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:23,360
because I have balls too, okay.

1246
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:26,530
Exactly don't feel bad because I have...

1247
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:28,743
Women, I've got the balls.

1248
00:53:30,118 --> 00:53:32,110
So I went out with this short, fat,

1249
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,663
bald-headed garbage man.

1250
00:53:34,899 --> 00:53:36,160
You know, everything was cool.

1251
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:37,720
We were go getting along very well.

1252
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:40,534
We went to the best
restaurants you can imagine.

1253
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:42,813
I gained like 10 pounds with this guy.

1254
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:46,480
But that came to a screeching halt too.

1255
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:49,510
One night after making love he reached over

1256
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,570
into the little refrigerator he
kept on the side of the bed,

1257
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:55,030
I had to made into a
nice one, it was really nice,

1258
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,433
and he pulled out a Twinky.

1259
00:53:58,405 --> 00:54:00,520
And when I saw the way
he ate the cream filling

1260
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,573
outta that Twinky I knew it was over.

1261
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:07,248
There's no way you're
gonna have mad skills like that

1262
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:08,540
and be holding out on me.

1263
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:11,883
He's outta here, he's out.

1264
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,180
So I went out with this weight lifter.

1265
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:23,950
Again, another tall man
with a body like a God.

1266
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,660
And that was beautiful.

1267
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:28,300
But he was holding back on me emotionally.

1268
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:29,470
You know what I mean, women?

1269
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,140
Why did they hold back on us emotionally?

1270
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:33,310
And I'm surprised, you know,

1271
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,650
because when I met him he was in the gym

1272
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,943
and weight lifters can
be very emotional people.

1273
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:43,090
I see him, he's working out.

1274
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,650
He's over here.

1275
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,008
I gotta show you what I'm talking about.

1276
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:47,478
You understand what I'm saying when I say

1277
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,240
weightlifters are very emotional?

1278
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:50,123
Here we go.

1279
00:55:05,018 --> 00:55:07,935
(Janine screaming)

1280
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:20,554
Later on that night with his girlfriend.

1281
00:55:20,604 --> 00:55:23,937
(soft squeaking noises)

1282
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:29,470
I don't get it. I don't get it.

1283
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,270
You ever talk to a Christian person

1284
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:34,900
and catch them in their
un-Christian like mood?

1285
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:38,050
You call their house and
their kid answers the phone

1286
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,685
and you hear them in
the background cussing.

1287
00:55:39,727 --> 00:55:41,710
"Now God dammit, you little (beep)

1288
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,180
getting on my damn nerves.

1289
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:45,167
Who the hell is that on the phone?"

1290
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:46,389
"It's sister Janine."

1291
00:55:46,439 --> 00:55:47,222
(throat clearing)

1292
00:55:47,272 --> 00:55:48,105
"Praise the Lord?"

1293
00:55:56,170 --> 00:55:57,003
Thank you.

1294
00:55:58,004 --> 00:56:01,254
(audience applauding)

1295
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,713
- All right, let's hear it for Janine Rose.

1296
00:56:12,763 --> 00:56:16,421
Can we have all of the
comedians that came up tonight

1297
00:56:16,471 --> 00:56:18,220
come on up, please.

1298
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:19,683
All of the comedians.

1299
00:56:22,704 --> 00:56:26,384
Let's hear it again for all
of our Newark Comedy Jam

1300
00:56:26,434 --> 00:56:28,228
comedians tonight.

1301

Tony Roberts, Janine Rose,

1302
00:56:30,839 --> 00:56:33,589
Sara Contreras, and Maleta Apogo.

1303
00:56:38,262 --> 00:56:41,512
(upbeat hip hop music)
