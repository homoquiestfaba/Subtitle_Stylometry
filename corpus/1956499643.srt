00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:12,250
[rustling]

2
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,291
[music playing]

3
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,500
[rustling]

4
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:06,541
[man] Ready?

5
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,958
[woman] There's no way.
- [man 2] Mm-mm.

6
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,250
[man 2 laughing]

7
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,375
- [woman] This is ridiculous.
- Mm-hmm.

8
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,875
- That's actually impressive.
- You're kidding me.

9
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:18,250
- [man] Cough it up, baby.
- Okay.

10
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:19,916
I'm gonna give you five.

11
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,208
I don't know how you do it, man.

12
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,166
- I'm just blessed.
- [woman] Hmm.

13
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,958
Thank you for contributing
to my slush funds.

14
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:28,583
Jesus.

15
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:30,875
[woman] Dude, this place is so disgusting.

16
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:33,166
[man] Don't trash the bar. It's just bugs.

17
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:36,250
- You should get an exterminator.
- Yeah, that's above my pay grade.

18
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,333
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, geez.

19
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:43,166
- [man laughs]
- You're such an asshole.

20
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:47,541
You know, they say when you see one,
there's thousands more in the walls.

21
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,958
- Shut up, Jeffrey.
- [man] Yeah, shut up, Jeffrey.

22
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,625
Why don't you make me?

23
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:55,791
Make me shut up.

24
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:01,416
[clears throat]

25
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,250
Don't mind me.

26
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,416
Trash coming through.

27
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:18,833
[man 3 retching]

28
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,041
[man 3 coughs]

29
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,916
How you living, Eric?

30
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,375
- Large.
- Expect nothing less.

31
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:27,833
[Eric] I'll be right down.

32
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,458
[man] That shirt comes off,
you drink for free.

33
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,916
- No. [chuckles]
- [man] Just saying.

34
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,041
- Oh, yeah?
- That's bar policy.

35
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,875
You get naked, it's free drinks all night.

36
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,375
Isn't that right, Mary?

37
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:48,666
Damn right.

38
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:50,625
I don't make the rules.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Come on. Give me a shot.

40
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,458
- Now we're talking. Now we're talking!
- Line 'em up.

41
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,541
Maybe you will see something
by the end of the night.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,416
Don't you tease me.

43
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,875
- Where you going?
- I'm just going to the bathroom, babe.

44
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,375
He seems like a good kid.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,791
He is a good kid. [laughs]

46
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,875
Wonder how long this one's gonna last.

47
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,458
I'm kidding! Come on, look...

48
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,291
May you both live happily ever after.

49
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,208
Cheers.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,416
Nah, I'm going to wait for my boyfriend.

51
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,166
Your loss.

52
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,750
[door opens and closes]

53
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,125
- M'lady.
- [rattling]

54
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,916
- Who the fuck are you, man?
- Whoa, whoa. Eric!

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,333
- Who the fuck are you?
- Hey! Eric! He's with me.

56
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,541
That's just Jeffrey, man.
You remember him.

57
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:50,833
Oh, yeah.

58
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:52,833
Oh, yeah.

59
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,791
- How you doing, brother man?
- Fine.

60
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:56,541
Thanks.

61
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:57,875
Good game.

62
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,625
Scored a goal. I'm here!

63
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:04,916
I was so close.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,666
If you break one more stool, Rosie's gonna
to make you stand while you're here.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,500
- Long night?
- [Eric sighs]

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,458
- Just getting started.
- Yeah?

67
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,166
- Usual?
- Yes, please.

68
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,541
[Will] Coming right up.

69
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,750
[Eric] You know what?

70
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,166
[chuckles]

71
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,583
You go buy yourself a drink.

72
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,000
[man] Wow. My man.

73
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:29,541
And drinks for the progressive couple
over there doing the smooching.

74
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,166
You're a real gentleman, Eric.

75
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,291
Oh, no, man. It's fine.
You don't have to do that.

76
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,708
Yeah. I know I don't have to.

77
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:37,375
I want to.

78
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,958
[woman] Thank you, Eric. We appreciate it.

79
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,250
[man] Thank you.

80
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,291
[Eric] Welcome.

81
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,250
That shirt better come off now.

82
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:50,000
[clears throat] Um... to, uh, Eric.

83
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:51,750
[man] To Eric!

84
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,208
[woman] Cheers.

85
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,666
[man] Oh, come on, Eric.

86
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,333
Everybody 21?

87
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,500
Yeah.

88
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,625
What about everybody else?

89
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:18,708
Yeah, man.

90
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:20,958
Want me to get them?

91
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:23,750
No.

92
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,833
Fuck it, you're fine. What do want?

93
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,458
Just beer. Four, please.

94
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,416
Just beer?

95
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:32,958
All right.

96
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,833
These are twist-off.
Y'all should be able to handle that?

97
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,083
Yeah, man. We can handle it.

98
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,041
You know those kids are underage, right?

99
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,583
Whatever. They're harmless.
Let them have their fun.

100
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,583
[indistinct chatter]

101
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:58,500
Hit me again, please.

102
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,666
Ah! Right, yep. My bad.

103
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,333
Jesus.

104
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,541
I swear, we got more bugs
than people in the bar tonight.

105
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,500
[woman] That's fucking gross.
Bugs were fucking on the whiskey.

106
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,166
- [Eric] Thank you.
- There you go.

107
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,250
[slurping]

108
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,500
- [grunts]
- There you are.

109
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,500
What's up, brother?

110
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,166
- I'm all right, how are you?
- Good.

111
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,375
Give me a hug, dude.
Enjoying your last days of freedom?

112
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,083
- You know it.
- Good. Good.

113
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,291
What's going on?

114
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,791
You fellas, let me know
if you need anything else.

115
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,250
We're good for now, brother.

116
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,291
- [Eric] Let's shot some pool!
- Pool!

117
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,666
- Hey, Mary.
- You wanna play?

118
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,625
He's been on a non-stop bender for a week.

119
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,125
He's back on the rig on Monday,
so I think we'll be safe.

120
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:45,708
[Mary] Fuck you, Eric!

121
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,083
[man] Hey, Mary!

122
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,250
Mary, come on. They're only kidding.

123
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,916
- [woman 2] Mary, wait.
- Kiss my ass, jerk.

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,916
[Eric] Where you going?

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,958
- You're breaking my heart.
- [man] Hey, fellas!

126
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,000
Just be cool, all right?

127
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,375
- It's a family establishment.
- Sorry, Mom!

128
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,958
Fucking animals.

129
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,208
Hey, what'd I just say?

130
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:04,833
Well...

131
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,666
You're a dick, Eric.

132
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,958
Whatever, babe.

133
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:13,291
- What happened with Mary?
- He was shoving the cue in her face.

134
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,500
Should we get out of here, maybe? Like...

135
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,208
go?

136
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm sorry.
Can you get this man a drink, please?

137
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,375
Yes. Yes, I can.

138
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,375
No. No, no. I don't want... I can't...

139
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,250
- Technically, it's my job.
- I got a deadline. Gotta work. I'm tired.

140
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,833
No, no, no. I have a deadline, so...

141
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,208
Why don't you get wasted and write drunk?

142
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,416
[Jeffrey sighs]

143
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,583
- That's what I'd do.
- [chuckles]

144
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,500
That doesn't sound like the best advice.

145
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,875
Got my ass through college.

146
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,791
Well, yeah, that was college.

147
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,500
You know he went to Tulane.

148
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,291
- Really? That's where I went.
- Yeah?

149
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,000
I think I was there a bit
before your time, sonny.

150
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,083
- When did you graduate?
- The year I dropped out.

151
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,875
- [glass shatters]
- Whoa!

152
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,708
[laughter]

153
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,500
Now what, bitch?

154
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,166
[grunts]

155
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,875
[man] Eric, knock it off!

156
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,041
Eric!

157
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:09,875
[grunting]

158
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,458
[Eric] Suck my dick, motherfucker.

159
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,833
Hey, Eric! Come on, man.

160
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,875
Someone get the bottle
out of that guy's hand!

161
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,291
Will, call the cops.

162
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:23,625
Motherfucker.

163
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,291
It's the bartender at Rose's.

164
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,833
We've got another fight breaking out.
Someone's gonna get hurt.

165
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,916
You wanna cut me? You wanna cut me?

166
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,541
[screams in pain]

167
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,000
[woman] Jeffrey, stop! Jeffrey, stop it!

168
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,166
Holy shit.

169
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,916
- Fuck!
- Jeffrey, stop!

170
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,166
[groaning in pain]

171
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:56,750
Okay, okay, okay.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

172
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,041
Did you call the cops?

173
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,125
Yeah. Yeah.

174
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:01,916
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

175
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,083
[Will] You got him, all right?
You got him.

176
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,541
Dude, what the fuck?
What the fuck? Dude...

177
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,625
- [door closes]
- You gotta go to the hospital, man.

178
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,791
- You call the cops?
- Of course, I called.

179
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,958
- I shoulda called an ambulance.
- Fucking pussy.

180
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,500
Dude, you got...

181
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,583
- [coughs]
- Let's go.

182
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,708
[chuckling]

183
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,333
[Eric] Quit milking it, man.

184
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,125
- Let's get outta here.
- [Eric] You're fine.

185
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,250
[door closes]

186
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,583
Here you go, man.

187
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:34,833
You all right?

188
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,375
Just fuck off, dude.

189
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,666
Yeah?

190
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,250
All right. Tell that to the cops
when they get here.

191
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,375
[Alicia] Grabbing a bottle in a fight
is chicken shit.

192
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,708
[panting]

193
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,583
What the hell was that?

194
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,541
You're not a tough guy.
You coulda been hurt.

195
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,583
He coulda killed him, I mean...

196
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,375
- What else was I supposed to do?
- Yeah, okay.

197
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,250
- [Will] You did good, kid.
- Fuck.

198
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,375
You did good.

199
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,333
Oh, fuck.

200
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,250
It's probably one of the kids'.

201
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,416
Fucked up that they actually filmed
the whole thing.

202
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,416
Fucking millennials.

203
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:20,666
[sighs]

204
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,333
Anybody need a drink?

205
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,125
[mumbling]

206
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:06,875
[yawns]

207
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,083
[humming]

208
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,125
Hey, honey.

209
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,666
[moans]

210
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,333
Guess who's home?

211
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,291
You feel like waking up?

212
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,000
Mm-mm.

213
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,083
Hmm?

214
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:35,541
Mm-mm.

215
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,583
[sighs]

216
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,041
[soft rustling]

217
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,500
[rustling continues]

218
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,083
[bottle cap clangs]

219
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:11,791
[phone vibrates]

220
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,541
[rustling continues]

221
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,875
[phone vibrates]

222
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:43,583
[phone vibrates]

223
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:57,416
[hissing]

224
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,250
[phone vibrates]

225
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:21,166
Now stop fucking around.

226
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,166
[phone vibrates]

227
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:31,958
[sighs]

228
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,708
[food sizzling in pan]

229
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,541
Good morning, pretty little thing.

230
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,625
Well... Oh...

231
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,625
You're going to make me burn the eggs.

232
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,208
Whose phone is that?

233
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,625
Just some chick. She left it at the bar.

234
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,083
So you brought it home?

235
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,458
Just picked it up...

236
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,541
and forgot to leave it there.

237
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,666
There was bit of a fracas
at the bar last night.

238
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,625
Cool.

239
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,583
[yawning] Thank you.

240
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,166
How's your paper coming?

241
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,291
I'm nearly there.

242
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:47,166
I just have to go over it again,
and probably rewrite the ending.

243
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,125
Turn it in to Steve and hope he likes it.

244
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,458
I'm sure he will.

245
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,416
He better. It's a quarter of my grade.

246
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,875
Yeah.

247
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:01,833
What are you gonna do today?

248
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:03,791
Don't know.

249
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,333
I don't have any plans.

250
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,458
Probably gonna check on Eric
at some point.

251
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,250
Why?

252
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,791
He's the one in the fight last night.

253
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,333
I thought you said it was a girl.

254
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,041
No, there was a group of college kids,
but when the fight started,

255
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,500
they got spooked and took off.

256
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,750
Eric got cut pretty bad, though.
It was brutal.

257
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,416
Well, that's not shocking.

258
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,041
I should probably go check on him.

259
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,625
What are you doing?

260
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,208
Trying to find out whose phone this is.

261
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,916
Why? Should I not look?

262
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,916
Am I gonna see something
I don't want to see?

263
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:45,750
No.

264
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:47,791
Why are you asking?

265
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:49,958
I don't know.

266
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,875
Why do you know how to unlock it?

267
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,083
From the smudge marks on the screen.

268
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,708
- I'm not lying about the phone, Carrie.
- Okay.

269
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,125
I believe you.

270
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,458
Oh! Fuck!

271
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,665
What?

272
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,165
What's wrong?

273
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,458
Who were you talking to last night?

274
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,541
What do you mean?

275
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,916
You were texting someone.

276
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,833
What is that, Will?

277
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,458
[Will] Jesus Christ.

278
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:57,833
Um...

279
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,208
Don't fuck with it.

280
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,291
Give it to the cops.
Somebody got hurt last night.

281
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,083
Yeah, someone could be fucking
with me, though.

282
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,125
Listen, it's...

283
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:11,291
Wednesday, so Duane will come in
after his shift. I'll give it to him then.

284
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,250
But what if that girl comes
to get it first?

285
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,000
Just say I don't have it.

286
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,208
Let's let the cops deal with it.

287
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,333
Okay.

288
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,083
Don't worry
your pretty little face about it.

289
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,791
You let your man handle things.

290
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,166
You're gonna make me late.

291
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,541
- Yeah, I am.
- I have to go.

292
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:35,708
- Mm-mm.
- Will...

293
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,875
you truly smell.

294
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:39,500
God!

295
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,416
[Carrie] He's only coming in
for that night,

296
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,333
so I said that we would have
dinner with him.

297
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,375
[Will] Ugh.

298
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,375
Dinner with your sober uncle?

299
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,833
What is the problem with that?

300
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,708
So he can fucking judge me the whole time.

301
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:00,916
- [Carrie] What?
- [tires screech]

302
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,250
- Shit!
- God, Will.

303
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:03,958
Look at these guys.

304
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,416
Fucking here for a higher education,

305
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,125
can't figure out how
to cross a goddamn road.

306
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,833
You know what happens to idiots like that?

307
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,291
- You're gonna tell me.
- They spend four years here.

308
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,458
Four years becoming an economic prisoner.

309
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,708
He should just go work at Rosie's.

310
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,083
Get a real job.

311
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,125
[scoffs]

312
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,041
I don't think he's Rosie's material.

313
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,416
No, he should stay here,

314
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,833
and fucking take lessons
from dillholes like that.

315
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:26,833
Hey, Steve.

316
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:29,875
Hi, Steve.

317
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,208
I'm gonna go learn from the dillhole.

318
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,583
- Yeah.
- See you later.

319
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,333
Love you.

320
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,583
[Carrie] Sorry I'm late.

321
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,333
How's it going?

322
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,916
[phone line ringing]

323
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:56,708
[Alicia] <i>Hey, what's up?</i>

324
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,416
- Come have a beer with me.
- [Jeffrey] <i>Babe, who are you talking to?</i>

325
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,666
[Alicia] <i>Fuck, dude. What time is it?</i>

326
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,000
It's like, 10:00 a.m.
What? Are you still sleeping?

327
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,000
[Alicia]
<i>Yeah, I didn't get to bed until sunrise.</i>

328
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,750
[Jeffrey]<i> Hang up the phone, babe.</i>

329
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,375
You're gonna have a beer with me
or not? I'm pulling up to Rosie's.

330
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,625
[Alicia]<i> No, asshole, I'm not.</i>
<i>I'm gonna go back to sleep.</i>

331
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,916
When did you become such a pussy?

332
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,416
[Alicia] <i>That's so wrong. You know it.</i>

333
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,666
<i>You have one for me,
and I'll see you tonight, okay?</i>

334
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,875
- All right.
- [Alicia chuckles]

335
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,083
- [Alicia] <i>Bye.</i>
- Bye.

336
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,041
What the fuck?

337
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,333
How's it hanging there, Rosie?

338
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:06,166
Oh, right and tight, loose, large.
Pick one.

339
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,041
Anyone come in looking for a cell phone?

340
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,625
Nope. Lost and found?

341
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:11,958
Yeah.

342
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,791
I heard what happened
with Eric last night.

343
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,333
Oh, yeah.

344
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,625
You should stop serving him
when he's fucked up.

345
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,166
He's always fucked up when he's home.

346
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,000
All right.

347
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,375
I can't leave the bar right now.
Can you go check on him?

348
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,541
[bells ringing in the distance]

349
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,000
Holy shit, Eric.

350
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,666
What is it?

351
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,375
You gotta go to the hospital.
I'm calling an ambulance.

352
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,875
- No, no, no.
- No, fuck that. Dude, your face.

353
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,000
Your face is fucked up!

354
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:04,083
I can see the inside of your mouth.

355
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,875
It's just swollen. That's all.

356

[Will] I don't know, dude.

357
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,791
I can get a buddy of mine to stitch it up.

358
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,125
A buddy of yours?

359
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,750
Come on, Eric.
You're not in fucking Afghanistan, dude.

360
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,500
[Eric] Can't go to a hospital.

361
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,625
- They'll ask questions.
- [Will] Like what?

362
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,166
You wanna be able to eat food
without it falling out of your face?

[Eric groans]

364

What friend?

368
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,125
The one who's banging your girl.

369
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,291
She's not my girl, dude.

371
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:00,458
Okay.

372
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,708
I just came to check on you.
I'll let you get your rest.

373
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:10,875
Hey, don't leave.

Yeah. All right, man.

376
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,208
I'll stay for a little bit.

377
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,625
Hey, man, you got any more beer?

378
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,250
Mm-hmm.

379
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:47,250

[cashier] Next!

390
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:30,750
I thought you said you didn't want a beer.

391
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:34,458
I think I meant that I didn't want
to have a beer for breakfast.

392
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:35,791
Hmm.

393
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,208
Hey, Will.

Hey, Jeffrey.

You get your little project done?

396

Yeah. Um... turned it in this morning.

Just chilling now.

398

[chuckles]

400
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:54,041
- You hear anything about Eric?
- Yeah, I went and saw him this morning.

401
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:56,208
His face is all cut to shit.

402
00:25:56,916 --> 00:25:59,708
He's refusing to go to the hospital,
because he thinks he's Rambo.

403
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:03,166
You want to join us?

404
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:05,750
No.

405
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,583
No, no. I got to go.

Just came for some to-go.

Nothing.

going to bring that to the police.

I can't believe you're
still going on about this.

You fucking talk about him all the time.

- He's my professor.
- And he obviously wants to fuck you.

You wanna go through my texts,
see if I sent him any pictures of my tits?

- Go on, check it.
- I don't want to.

458

I don't want to, because I trust you.

I want to trust you.

Is this who you were talking to?

I don't think so.

469
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:55,000

- No.

471

Why didn't you call us?

an hour and a half to respond.

No, man. I don't mean Fifth District.
I mean us.

So...

535
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:35,958
what about the guy that did this?

536
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:39,291
I don't know.
I've never seen him before in my life.

537
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:41,666
Kind of figured it was
just something between them.

538
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:45,333
I tell you what. You see him, you call us.

539
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:49,500
I want to talk to him,
see how tough this bitch really is.

540
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:50,708
[Will] Yeah, okay.

541
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:53,583
There was also
these college kids at the bar,

542
00:37:53,666 --> 00:37:55,833
and they left a cell phone there.

543
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:58,000
I went through it to see whose it was,

544
00:37:58,083 --> 00:38:00,625
and I found some
really fucked up shit in there.

545
00:38:01,791 --> 00:38:02,833
Like what, exactly?

546
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:05,875
There was a dead guy.

547
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,625
He looked murdered.

548
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:09,375
- Murdered?
- Yeah.

549
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:11,375
Where's the phone?

550
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:13,291
I lost it.

551
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,208
You lost it?

552
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:16,708
Yeah, on the way here.

553
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:19,125
But I think it was
those college kids, man.

554
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:20,625
I think they took it.

555
00:38:20,708 --> 00:38:22,791
They've been following me around
in a black Charger.

556
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:26,500
I know it sounds crazy,
but my girlfriend saw the pictures, too.

557
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:27,958
I'm telling you guys the truth.

558
00:38:28,458 --> 00:38:31,708
So, uh, you got a license plate
on this black Charger?

559
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:33,541
Yeah, yeah.

560
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:36,000
Uh, I think it started with a six.

561
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
A six?

562
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,958
Yeah.

563
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:43,125
That's it?

564
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:46,958
Yeah.

565
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:48,625
[chuckles]

566
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:49,958
Okay, Will.

567
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:52,458
Look, man, if you, uh...

568
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:54,208
want to make a statement,

569
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:57,458
just give us all the details,
and we'll see what we can do.

570
00:38:57,833 --> 00:38:58,750
Sure.

571
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:00,250
[Duane] I need to go get the forms.

572
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:02,875
I hate when people touch
my shit on my desk.

573
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:05,708
We going to see you tonight?

574
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:12,166
Yeah, man. I'll be there. Same as usual.

575
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:19,416
- [grunts]
- [laughs]

576
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,708
[man] Too much on it, man.
I put too much heat.

577
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,958
[Duane] About to put heat on your ass.

578
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:32,541
- 'Sup, bitches.
- How's it going?

579
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:34,583
- [Duane] What's up big hair?
- How's the main bitch?

580
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:36,416
What's shakin', bacon?

581
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,500
[Alicia] Not much.

582
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:41,166
It's quiet in here tonight.

583
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,250
Yeah, I finally get you all to myself.

584
00:39:43,541 --> 00:39:45,166
Oh, ho, ho.

585
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,708
Speaking of, where's Jeffrey?

586
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:50,291
Punishing him.

587
00:39:50,666 --> 00:39:52,250
He's being a jealous asshole.

588
00:39:53,416 --> 00:39:54,708
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

589
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:56,333
Jealous of who?

590
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,208
None of your business, bartender.

591
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:01,166
Mm-hmm.

592
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:05,666
Mm-mm.

593
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:09,291
I'm just gonna do the one.
I'm trying to take it easy.

594
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:10,708
Why?

595
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:12,958
'Cause I don't wanna be wasted.

596
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:14,333
Then just don't get wasted.

597
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:17,000
Just do what I do, maintain the buzz.

598
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:19,166
It's like surfing, only more fun.

599
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,958
I don't think you should be telling me
how to drink.

600
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:24,500
[glasses clang together]

601
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:29,208
I need to drink tonight...

602
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:30,875
and you're here.

603
00:40:31,583 --> 00:40:33,125
So, you just became my backup.

604
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:35,458
What's wrong?

605
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:36,500
Nothing.

606
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:39,083
Just got some shit on my brain
I don't want on my brain.

607
00:40:44,416 --> 00:40:46,500
I've also got an eight-ball in my pocket.

608
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,666
If you wanna play.

609
00:40:49,791 --> 00:40:51,791
[snorting]

610
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,291
[snorting]

611
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,875
- [Will] Try to talk to it.
- Okay.

612
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:04,416
[Will] Just be like, "Hi, what's up?"

613
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,208
[Alicia] Like, whatever, we're so over...

614
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:09,625
[Will] That would've been
impressive if you caught it,

615
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:12,041
'cause you did extra flips.
That's extra brownie points.

616
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,416
Okay, just like easy, like,
"Hey, how you doing? What's up?"

617
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,541
It's been a while.

618
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:21,250
- That's too much.
- Yeah, she's playing hard-to-get.

619
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:22,625
- Try a different one.
- Okay.

620
00:41:22,708 --> 00:41:23,916
- This one's Hubert.
- Okay.

621
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,166
He's much nicer. Try. Ready?

622
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:26,541
Boom!

623
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:28,458
- It's that easy. Really.
- It's like, finesse.

624
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:29,958
Yeah, just like I...

625
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:31,083
[man] 'Sup, yo!

626
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:33,708
Douglas.

627
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,333
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- William.

628
00:41:36,875 --> 00:41:38,916
The fuck does it look like?
I fucking work here.

629
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,916
- You know that, come on.
- It's your shift already?

630
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,500
- What time is it?
- I don't know.

631
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,750
Y'all drunk, huh?

632
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:48,291
- You're drunk.
- Uh-uh. I'm handsome.

633
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:50,291
- You drunk.
- [Will] We both are drunk.

634
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:51,375
He's handsome.

635
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:53,291
I'll take it. [laughs]

636
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:54,875
I don't wanna go to sleep yet.

637
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:56,416
I don't either.

638
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:02,458
- Don't do that.
- See. These are scheming fingers.

639
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:05,375
- What are you doing?
- Scheme, scheme...

640
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:08,833
Let's go to The Fly.

641
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:10,208
Let's kill this thing.

642
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:12,958
[groans]

643
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:14,500
Okay, there you go.

644
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:15,916
[groans, laughs]

645
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:18,625
Co-pilot responsibilities.

646
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:19,666
Oh, fuck.

647
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
So much for cutting back.

648
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:27,250
Well, I guess there's always tomorrow.

649
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:30,333
That's the point, Will.

650
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:33,583
I'm almost 30,
and I'm wasting my life away.

651
00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:36,000
No. I don't think you're wasting it.

652
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:37,541
I think you're living it.

653
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,958
I don't know.

654
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:46,541
Listen...

655
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:50,333
you're drinking tonight
because I asked you to drink,

656
00:42:50,416 --> 00:42:51,666
so that's an exception.

657
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:53,916
You're basically drinking out of sympathy.

658
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:55,875
You're like a saint.

659
00:42:57,333 --> 00:42:58,500
Canonized.

660
00:42:58,791 --> 00:42:59,750
Is that the word?

661
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:02,166
- Yes.
- Deified. No, that makes you a god.

662
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:04,166
You are a goddess. Let's be honest.

663
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,208
- [laughs]
- Can a god be a saint?

664
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:11,833
- Hey.
- Hmm?

665
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:16,916
You know if you ever need to talk to me
about anything, I'm here for you.

666
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:20,208
Yeah.

667
00:43:26,458 --> 00:43:27,458
[bottle cork pops]

668
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:29,958
[indistinct chatter]

669
00:43:56,916 --> 00:43:58,833
This is so nice.

670
00:44:00,791 --> 00:44:01,791
It is.

671
00:44:03,625 --> 00:44:04,875
There's no people.

672
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,000
I like no people.

673
00:44:14,958 --> 00:44:17,750
God, you smell so good.

674
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:21,416
[Alicia moans]

675
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:48,208
Will. Will. Will...

676
00:44:48,291 --> 00:44:50,541
- Will, stop!
- What? What?

677
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:52,250
What? What's wrong?

678
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:53,666
[sighs]

679
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:54,875
You know what's wrong.

680
00:44:57,166 --> 00:44:58,333
What is it? Jeffrey?

681
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,041
Yeah, of course it's Jeffrey.
Come on, Will.

682
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:03,166
Yeah, but why?

683
00:45:03,416 --> 00:45:05,000
Why? I don't even understand it.

684
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:06,458
I don't know. Jesus.

685
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:08,958
I dunno. It's your girlfriend, too.

686
00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:13,041
Yeah, but...

687
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,666
don't worry about her.

688
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:16,666
- Will, stop.
- Come on.

689
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:17,958
Will, stop it.

690
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:19,625
- Stop it!
- Fine.

691
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:27,458
We should just go.

692
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:02,208
She doesn't even love me anymore,
you know?

693
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:16,166
I'm sorry if she doesn't love you anymore.

694
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:22,916
That's true. I really am sorry.

695
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:29,875
[car door closes]

696
00:47:05,208 --> 00:47:06,916
[phone ringing]

697
00:47:17,875 --> 00:47:20,291
Hey, sorry I'm late.
I'm on my way. I'll be back in...

698
00:47:20,375 --> 00:47:21,500
[phone line beeps]

699
00:47:21,791 --> 00:47:22,708
[phone beeps]

700
00:47:34,083 --> 00:47:36,291
[car engine starts]

701
00:48:10,291 --> 00:48:11,291
[door closes]

702
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:15,666
Carrie?

703
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:29,625
Hello?

704
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:45,166
Hey.

705
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:48,666
Carrie.

706
00:48:50,166 --> 00:48:51,083
You okay?

707
00:48:51,333 --> 00:48:52,208
Hi.

708
00:48:53,875 --> 00:48:54,958
What time is it?

709
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:57,916
What is that?

710
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:01,208
Nothing.

711
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:03,416
Did you just get home?

712

01:09:47,832 --> 01:09:49,500
<i>Just do what you need to do.</i>

895
01:09:51,666 --> 01:09:52,707
Thanks, man.

896
01:09:53,041 --> 01:09:55,666
<i>It's no problem at all.
That's what friends are for.</i>

897
01:09:56,208 --> 01:09:57,250
All right.

898
01:09:57,916 --> 01:09:59,291
Hey, I appreciate it, man.

899
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:01,125
Bye.

900
01:10:01,208 --> 01:10:03,458
<i>And your boy Eric called down here, man.</i>

901
01:10:04,083 --> 01:10:05,583
Wait, sorry. What'd you say?

902
01:10:06,583 --> 01:10:09,083
<i>I said Eric called down, asking for you.</i>

903
01:10:09,166 --> 01:10:10,583
<i>I told him you went home early.</i>

904
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:13,208
What did he want?

905
01:10:13,583 --> 01:10:16,166
<i>I don't know. Said something
about giving you a present.</i>

906
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:17,750
<i>I gave him your number, though.</i>

907
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:19,666
<i>Probably a booty call.</i>

908
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,458
[Doug laughs]

909
01:10:21,541 --> 01:10:24,083
<i>Look, I don't judge, brother,
but I knew that's what it is.</i>

910
01:10:24,166 --> 01:10:25,416
All right, gotcha.

911
01:11:15,875 --> 01:11:17,750
[phone line ringing]

912
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:19,625
[Alicia] <i>Hey, Will.</i>

913
01:11:20,041 --> 01:11:21,416
<i>You shouldn't call here.</i>

914
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:25,875
So, you told him, huh?

915
01:11:26,541 --> 01:11:27,500
<i>Yeah.</i>

916
01:11:28,916 --> 01:11:30,458
<i>Yeah, I didn't mean to.</i>

917
01:11:32,166 --> 01:11:34,625
<i>Maybe I did. I don't know.
I thought we could go back to normal.</i>

918
01:11:34,708 --> 01:11:35,875
<i>I was stupid.</i>

919
01:11:39,416 --> 01:11:40,416
Is he there now?

920
01:11:41,416 --> 01:11:43,208
<i>Yeah. He's in the other room.</i>

921
01:11:43,291 --> 01:11:44,625
You sure it's a good idea?

922
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:45,958
<i>Everything's fine.</i>

923
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:49,791
<i>Look, I can't talk to you right now.
I have to go, okay?</i>

924
01:11:52,166 --> 01:11:53,208
<i>Goodnight, Will.</i>

925
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:54,583
[phone disconnects]

926
01:12:05,541 --> 01:12:06,500
What the fuck?

927
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
We really need to do something about that.

928
01:12:21,166 --> 01:12:22,583
I think we should break up.

929
01:12:24,166 --> 01:12:25,375
I don't think this is working.

930
01:12:31,958 --> 01:12:32,833
Okay.

931
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:36,875
That's all you got?

932
01:12:37,791 --> 01:12:38,666
"Okay"?

933
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:44,333
Why are you acting offended?
You're breaking up with me.

934
01:12:46,541 --> 01:12:49,166
I can't believe how calmly
you're taking this whole thing.

935
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,375
I guess you can probably find
a place to crash

936
01:12:56,458 --> 01:12:58,333
while you look for a new apartment, right?

937
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:02,083
Already? Today?

938
01:13:06,458 --> 01:13:08,541
What did you expect? That we'd cuddle?

939
01:13:08,958 --> 01:13:10,208
Fuck you.

940
01:13:11,958 --> 01:13:13,125
I'm sorry. [scoffs]

941
01:13:15,708 --> 01:13:18,750
It's just this whole thing with the phone,
and the pictures.

942
01:13:20,375 --> 01:13:21,458
It's dangerous.

943
01:13:22,708 --> 01:13:24,333
And I don't want you anywhere around it.

944
01:13:24,791 --> 01:13:25,708
Really?

945
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:29,583
Are you a hero now?

946
01:13:29,666 --> 01:13:30,708
Come on, Carrie.

947
01:13:31,291 --> 01:13:32,666
Do you hear yourself?

948
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:36,666
You're scared.

949
01:13:38,125 --> 01:13:39,375
I'm scared, too.

950
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:43,000
But I would never abandon you to it.

951
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:44,458
That's not what I'm saying.

952
01:13:44,541 --> 01:13:45,458
Fuck you.

953
01:13:47,541 --> 01:13:49,541
I wasn't mad until just now.

954
01:13:50,166 --> 01:13:51,750
I was disappointed.

955
01:13:52,583 --> 01:13:53,458
I was hurt.

956
01:13:54,875 --> 01:13:56,416
But now, I'm just fucking pissed.

957
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:59,083
So, if that's what you wanted,
then, you got it.

958
01:14:00,791 --> 01:14:01,833
It's not what I wanted.

959
01:14:03,541 --> 01:14:05,000
You know what I think you want?

960
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,541
Nothing.

961
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:13,541
Because there's nothing there to satisfy.

962
01:14:16,791 --> 01:14:18,791
You are a mock person.

963
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:23,666
You're just a body.

964
01:14:24,416 --> 01:14:26,458
[breathing heavily]

965
01:14:52,041 --> 01:14:53,458
[Carrie sobs]

966
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:06,666
[Carrie continues sobbing]

967
01:15:32,375 --> 01:15:33,375
You okay?

968
01:15:36,708 --> 01:15:38,083
Fucking Doug say something?

969
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:39,625
No.

970
01:15:42,208 --> 01:15:43,416
Did something happen?

971
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:47,041
Nope.

972
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,416
Well, you look like shit.

973
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:54,500
Have you even showered today?

974
01:16:00,208 --> 01:16:01,250
Hit me again.

975
01:16:02,333 --> 01:16:03,666
I don't think that's a good idea.

976
01:16:04,708 --> 01:16:06,375
Your shift starts soon, anyway.

977
01:16:07,416 --> 01:16:08,791
I'm a grown ass man.

978
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,458
Do I need to worry about you?

979
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:15,625
Nope.

980
01:16:16,291 --> 01:16:17,583
You really don't, Rosie.

981
01:16:32,708 --> 01:16:35,333
- Oh! I'm sorry!
- Motherfucker!

982
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:36,833
I can buy you another drink, man.

983
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:38,750
- I don't want your drink!
- Hey!

984
01:16:38,833 --> 01:16:39,708
No problem, man.

985
01:16:47,708 --> 01:16:49,041
[Rosie] What's gotten into you?

986
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:52,916
Go home.

987
01:16:53,291 --> 01:16:54,208
Take a shower.

988
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:55,625
Get your head straight.

989
01:16:55,708 --> 01:16:56,708
What about my shift?

990
01:16:56,791 --> 01:16:58,666
Don't worry about it.
I'll cover you for tonight.

991
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:00,375
I don't want you to.

992
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:02,750
I don't want you to.

993
01:17:03,833 --> 01:17:04,708
Well...

994
01:17:05,708 --> 01:17:07,208
Fuck you, Rosie.

995
01:17:11,458 --> 01:17:12,458
Excuse me?

996
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:14,208
Fuck me?

997
01:17:15,583 --> 01:17:16,583
Fuck you.

998
01:17:17,875 --> 01:17:19,791
Do you want to keep this job?

999
01:17:20,041 --> 01:17:21,250
Fuck your job.

1000
01:17:21,875 --> 01:17:23,000
[door opens]

1001
01:17:23,916 --> 01:17:25,041
[door slams shut]

1002
01:17:32,083 --> 01:17:34,000
[phone line ringing]

1003
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:37,125
<i>Hey, it's Alicia. Leave a message.</i>

1004
01:17:38,708 --> 01:17:40,750
Alicia, it's me. It's important.

1005
01:17:40,833 --> 01:17:42,708
I need you to call me back.

1006
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,250
I know you're getting these messages.

1007
01:17:48,333 --> 01:17:49,250
Fuck!

1008
01:17:49,333 --> 01:17:50,500
[bottle shatters]

1009
01:17:55,208 --> 01:17:57,083
[breathing heavily]

1010
01:18:09,833 --> 01:18:11,541
[flies buzzing]

1011
01:18:46,208 --> 01:18:48,125
[flies buzzing]

1012
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:12,125
Eric.

1013
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:30,208
Christ.

1014
01:19:33,833 --> 01:19:34,750
Eric?

1015
01:19:37,625 --> 01:19:39,333
[sighs deeply]

1016
01:19:42,041 --> 01:19:43,000
Eric?

1017
01:19:47,041 --> 01:19:48,208
Eric, you in here, man?

1018
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:06,625
How you living, man?

1019
01:20:13,458 --> 01:20:14,791
Did someone break in here?

1020
01:20:16,291 --> 01:20:17,500
[Eric] What do you want?

1021
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:21,083
Just checking on you, man.

1022
01:20:23,791 --> 01:20:24,708
I'm good.

1023
01:20:27,791 --> 01:20:29,625
I gotta crash here for a few days.

1024
01:20:33,458 --> 01:20:35,125
I gotta stay on your couch...

1025
01:20:35,708 --> 01:20:36,791
for a day or two.

1026
01:20:40,708 --> 01:20:41,583
No.

1027
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:47,208
I'm up against a wall, man.

1028
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:48,666
No!

1029
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:57,000
I'm gonna clean up
around here a little bit.

1030
01:20:58,291 --> 01:20:59,291
It'll be good.

1031
01:21:00,958 --> 01:21:02,041
Don't worry about it.

1032
01:21:12,875 --> 01:21:14,958
[phone line ringing]

1033
01:21:18,625 --> 01:21:20,000
[sighs]

1034
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:26,000
[Alicia] <i>I said you shouldn't call here.</i>

1035
01:21:26,791 --> 01:21:29,125
Yeah, but that was last night,
when you were with Jeffrey.

1036
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:31,750
Where are you now? Are you okay?

1037
01:21:32,458 --> 01:21:34,625
<i>Will, I'm trying to fix my life, okay?</i>

1038
01:21:35,583 --> 01:21:37,875
<i>I need you to stop calling me.
It's not helping.</i>

1039
01:21:38,125 --> 01:21:39,041
Wait.

1040
01:21:39,958 --> 01:21:40,958
I left Carrie.

1041
01:21:42,375 --> 01:21:44,833
- I broke up with her this morning.
- [Alicia sighs]

1042
01:21:48,541 --> 01:21:49,583
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

1043
01:21:52,833 --> 01:21:54,291
<i>I'm sorry to hear that, Will.</i>

1044
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:57,541
No, that's, that's good news... right?

1045
01:21:57,916 --> 01:22:00,333
<i>- I don't know. That's up to you.</i>
- Wait, don't. Alicia...

1046
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:01,833
<i>Will, I'm with Jeffrey.</i>

1047
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
<i>I love Jeffrey. Do you understand that?</i>

1048
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:07,916
No.

1049
01:22:08,708 --> 01:22:10,458
No, I don't understand that at all.

1050
01:22:10,541 --> 01:22:12,500
<i>I don't know when
we're coming back to the bar.</i>

1051
01:22:12,583 --> 01:22:14,000
<i>Maybe not for a while, okay?</i>

1052
01:22:15,083 --> 01:22:16,166
<i>Don't call me back.</i>

1053
01:22:17,083 --> 01:22:19,541
<i>If you really care about me,
you cannot call me back.</i>

1054
01:22:20,166 --> 01:22:21,750
[phone clicks then beeps]

1055
01:23:07,625 --> 01:23:09,708
You can't be in here. [breathing heavily]

1056
01:23:12,458 --> 01:23:13,458
You hear me?

1057
01:23:15,333 --> 01:23:16,625
I don't want you here.

1058
01:23:20,083 --> 01:23:21,250
Didn't you call me?

1059
01:23:26,083 --> 01:23:26,958
No.

1060
01:23:30,041 --> 01:23:31,291
[Eric grunts]

1061
01:23:31,625 --> 01:23:35,041
Someone called the bar last night
from this number, looking for me.

1062
01:23:36,416 --> 01:23:38,375
If it wasn't you, who the fuck was it?

1063
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,375
They made me do it.

1064
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:43,583
Those freaks.

1065
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,125
Was it the fucking college kids?

1066
01:23:48,166 --> 01:23:49,041
Was it?

1067
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,750
They told me to give you a present.

1068
01:23:51,833 --> 01:23:53,416
Now get the fuck off me!

1069
01:23:54,791 --> 01:23:55,833
I'll kill you.

1070
01:23:57,291 --> 01:23:58,416
I'll kill you.

1071
01:23:58,791 --> 01:24:00,125
[Eric panting]

1072
01:24:06,916 --> 01:24:08,000
[Eric grunts]

1073
01:24:08,708 --> 01:24:10,708
[Eric breathing heavily]

1074
01:24:18,291 --> 01:24:19,666
What's the present, Eric?

1075
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,083
[phone vibrates]

1076
01:24:57,541 --> 01:24:58,541
[phone vibrates]

1077
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:14,750
Are you the wrapping?

1078
01:25:23,666 --> 01:25:25,625
You can feel it moving around in there.

1079
01:25:26,875 --> 01:25:27,875
Can't you?

1080
01:25:27,958 --> 01:25:28,958
Please leave.

1081
01:25:29,208 --> 01:25:30,833
Shh.

1082
01:25:31,625 --> 01:25:33,125
Most people don't know you.

1083
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:35,416
They don't see the evil

1084
01:25:36,083 --> 01:25:38,000
and the ugly in your heart.

1085
01:25:43,375 --> 01:25:44,958
You have to be dead first...

1086
01:25:48,291 --> 01:25:50,625
or will they rip you open
while you're still alive.

1087
01:25:56,666 --> 01:25:58,541
I wonder what would happen if I called it.

1088
01:26:22,041 --> 01:26:24,333
[indistinct sound]

1089
01:26:32,625 --> 01:26:33,791
[Eric groans]

1090
01:26:39,125 --> 01:26:41,083
[Eric groaning]

1091
01:26:44,916 --> 01:26:46,708
[screams]

1092
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:54,791
[gasping]

1093
01:26:54,875 --> 01:26:57,833
[screaming in pain]

1094
01:27:01,333 --> 01:27:03,083
[Eric continues to scream in pain]

1095
01:27:06,833 --> 01:27:09,791
[screaming continues]

1096
01:27:17,791 --> 01:27:20,791
[Eric screams and coughs]

1097
01:27:25,583 --> 01:27:29,291
[Eric] Don't do it, please.
Don't do it! Don't do it! Don't do it!

1098
01:27:31,083 --> 01:27:32,083
Don't do this.

1099
01:27:32,166 --> 01:27:35,125
[Eric groaning in pain]

1100
01:27:46,416 --> 01:27:49,291
[screaming in pain]

1101
01:27:58,541 --> 01:27:59,750
Fix me.

1102
01:28:01,166 --> 01:28:02,708
Make me whole.

1103
01:28:02,791 --> 01:28:05,916
[Eric groaning in pain]

1104
01:28:08,708 --> 01:28:11,166
[screaming continues]

1105
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:34,000
[silence]

1106
01:28:38,041 --> 01:28:40,541
[ambient music playing]

1107
01:34:54,041 --> 01:34:55,791
[music fades out]
