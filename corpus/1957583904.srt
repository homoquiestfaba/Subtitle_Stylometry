1
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,100
(dog barking)

2
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,650
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hboy:
WE THERE YET, MOM?

3
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,380
Mom: DIDN'T SOMEBODY PROMISE
THEY WEREN'T GOING TO ASK THAT?

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,120
\h\hJUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOU WERE PAYING ATTENTION.

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,150
DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D
DO WITHOUT YOU, ZACK.

6
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,790
girl: WHY DO YOU HAVE
TO BUG EVERYBODY?

7
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,400
DAD SENT YOU THAT BOOK SO
YOU COULD READ AND NOT TALK.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:33,830
NO.

9
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,130
HE SENT IT TO ME

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,430
BECAUSE HE KNOWS I'M GOING
\h\hTO BE A HERO SOME DAY.

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,600
WHAT KIND OF HERO CAN
\hAN 11 YEAR OLD BE?

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,200
MAYBE I'LL SAVE YOU FROM
A PACK OF HUNGRY WOLVES.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,500
WHATEVER.

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,540
OR MAYBE I WON'T.

15
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,580
Zack:: MOM, WE'RE NOT MOVING
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTO A DIFFERENT TOWN

16
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,180
\h\hBECAUSE YOU AND DAD
GOT DIVORCED, ARE WE?

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:51,610
NO.

18
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,910
WE'RE MOVING TO HOPE SPRINGS

19
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,520
BECAUSE THE COMPANY ASKED ME TO
RUN THEIR BIGGEST NURSING HOME.

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,550
IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE AN HONOR.

21
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,590
IF I SEE ONE MORE TREE,
\h\hI'M GOING TO PUKE.

22
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,320
\h\hYOU'RE NOT UNHAPPY
ABOUT MOVING, ARE YOU?

23
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,200
NOT AT ALL.

24
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:07,230
IT FEELS LIKE A BIG ADVENTURE.

25
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,480
I GOT YOU SOME BEEF JERKY.

26
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,520
THANKS.

27
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,250
WILL YOU STOP THAT?

28
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,000
IT ITCHES.

29
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,160
DID MR. HARPER GIVE YOU
YOUR FINAL PAYCHECK?

30
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,460
YEAH.

31
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,630
200 LOUSY BUCKS.

32
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,970
SO I FIGURE, HE OWED
\h\h\h\h\hME SOME SNACKS.

33
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,700
NOW THAT YOU GOT FIRED,
ARE YOU GONNA --

34
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,440
ARE YOU GONNA,
LIKE, MOVE BACK HOME?

35
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,740
NO.

36
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,210
\h\h\h\hMY FAMILY RENTED MY ROOM TO
SOME GEEKAZOID COLLEGE STUDENT.

37
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,380
WE DESERVE BETTER
THAN THIS, LEO.

38
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,110
WE NEED AN OPPORTUNITY.

39
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,410
LOOK AT THIS.

40
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,150
YEAH.

41
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,750
OH, SOMEBODY LEFT THEIR CAR ON.

42
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,050
\h\h\h\h\h\hHEY, MAYBE WE
SHOULD TURN IT OFF.

43
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,350
THIS IS A SIGN, LEO.

44
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,090
SOMEBODY WANTS US
TO HAVE THIS CAR.

45
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,820
IT'S FIRST PIECE OF DECENT
\h\hLUCK I'VE HAD ALL YEAR.

46
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,130
\hWHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,730
THIS IS OUR TICKET OUT
\hOF THIS NOWHERE TOWN.

48
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,030
WE CAN'T JUST STEAL A CAR.

49
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,760
WE'RE NOT STEALING IT, OKAY.

50
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,070
WE'RE BORROWING IT.

51
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,370
WE'LL CALL AND TELL THEM WHERE
TO PICK IT UP WHEN WE'RE DONE.

52
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,100
GET IN OR STAY
AND GET BUSTED,

53
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,840
\h\h\h\h\h\hBECAUSE THAT'S STOLEN
MERCHANDISE YOU'RE ABOUT TO EAT.

54
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,700
COME ON, GET IN.

55
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,740
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hLeo:
OH, MAN, YOU STOLE THIS STUFF?

56
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,280
(video game beeping)

57
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,720
FASTER.

58
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,890
AH!

59
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,620
IF I COULD JUST GET
TO THE NEXT GALAXY.

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,860
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hLeo:
THIS IS CRAZY.

61
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,160
I TOLD YOU, WE'RE
ONLY BORROWING IT.

62
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,330
ANYWAYS, THIS IS WILL BE
A GOOD LESSON FOR THE OWNERS

63
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,070
TO NOT LEAVE THEIR
KEYS IN THE CAR.

64
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:53,940
WHEN YOU THINK
ABOUT IT THAT WAY,

65
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,100
WE'RE ACTUALLY
DOING A GOOD DEED.

66
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,710
FRANKIE, LOOK, A COUPLE
OF CUTE DOGS BACK HERE.

67
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,010
I'LL PULL OVER
AND WE CAN LET THEM OUT.

68
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,440
NO, NO.

69
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,740
THEY'RE TOO CUTE.

70
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,040
WE CAN'T JUST LET THEM OUT
\hIN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

71
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,790
ALL RIGHT, YOU BIG SISSY.

72
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,250
WE'LL FIND A GOOD
PLACE TO DROP THEM OFF.

73
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,980
Zack:
\hMOM?

74
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,300
20 MORE MILES.

75
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,020
JUST CHECKING.

00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,200
\h\h\h\h\h\hLeo: YOU KNOW I'M NOT
SCRATCHING MY HEAD ANYMORE.

77
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,490
FASCINATING, LEO.

78
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,660
\h\h\hYEAH, BUT MY HAD HASN'T
ITCHED SINCE WE LEFT TOWN.

79
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,830
\hI MEAN, I'M ALWAYS
SCRATCHING MY HEAD.

80
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,000
GOOD FOR YOU.

82
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,100
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hMom:

83
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,700

HEY, EVERYTHING YOU NEED IS
RIGHT HERE ON MAIN STREET.

85
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,470
I HAVEN'T SEEN A MALL.

86
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,770
DO THEY EVEN HAVE ONE HERE?

87
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,940
LOOK, CURIOSITY STORE.

88
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,810
IT LOOKS COOL.

89
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,110
CAN WE STOP IN THERE, MOM?

90
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,980
OH, NO, NO.

91
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,010
THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF TIME
\hTO EXPLORE THIS WHOLE TOWN.

92
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,310
AN OLD TOWN SQUARE.

93
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,180
LOOK OUT!

YOU COULD HAVE KILLED ME.

98

YOU'RE DRIVING LIKE A MANIAC.

99
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,760
IS EVERYBODY OKAY?

00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,930
OH, MAN.

105
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,230
KEEP THIS DOG AWAY FROM ME!

106
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,970
YOU'RE SUCH A DRAMA QUEEN.

107
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:08,840
COME HERE.

108
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,700
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,070
COOL.

117
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:58,290
WOW.

118
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,550
HELLO?

119
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,420
HI.

120
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,720

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,800
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hLISTEN, I'LL CALL YOU
NATALIE IF YOU CALL ME PAULA.

124
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,960
DONUT?

125
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,830
SURE.

126
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,130
I USUALLY WORK THE NIGHTS,

127
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,300
BUT HEAD NURSE HAD ME COME IN
EARLY SO I COULD MEET YOU.

128
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,900
OH, NURSE BLEAKER, I LOOK
\hFORWARD TO MEETING HER.

129
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,220
YEAH, WELL DON'T
GET TOO ANXIOUS.

130
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,070
HER MIGRAINES ARE ACTING UP,

131
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,240
AND SHE'S IN ONE OF HER
NOT-SO-RARE MOODS.

132
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,280
OH.

133
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,180
YOU LEFT THE COOKIES ON
\hTHE LUNCH TRAY AGAIN.

134
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,480
I KNOW.

135
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,790
I FIGURED THAT IF ANYONE WANTED
AN EXTRA COOKIE AFTER LUNCH,

136
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,090
THEY COULD JUST HELP THEMSELVES.

137
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,560
THIS IS A NURSING HOME.

138
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,590
IF WE LET THE RESIDENTS EAT
ALL THE COOKIES THEY WANT,

139
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,330
HOW ARE WE HELPING THEM?

140
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,630
I DON'T THINK AN EXTRA COOKIE
\h\h\h\h\hEVERY NOW AND THEN

141
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,800
IS GOING TO HURT ANYBODY.

142
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,400
AND WHO ARE YOU?

143
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,700

00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,470
OH, WELL, EXCUSE ME.

00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,770
IT'S VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

147
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,080
NICE TO MEET YOU.

148
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,240
I WAS EXPECTING YOU
\hA LITTLE EARLIER.

149
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,560
OH, RIGHT.

150
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,850
WELL, I STOPPED TO
\h\hGET SOME DONUTS.

151
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,150
WOULD YOU LIKE ONE?

152
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,020
NO, THANK YOU.

153
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,190
I DON'T LIKE ANYTHING SWEET.

154
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,490
OKAY.

155
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:44,560
EXCUSE ME, MY BRAIN FEELS
\h\hLIKE A CLENCHED FIST.

156
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:52,370
SHALL WE?

157
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,230
OKAY.

158
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,100
NICE TO MEET YOU.

159
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:54,540
BYE.

160
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,700
BYE.

161
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,910
THANK YOU FOR THE BIRTHDAY
PRESENT, GRANDPA.

162
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,080
THIS IS DODGE.

163
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,680
SHE'S VERY LITTLE TROUBLE.

164
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,420
MR. MCCOY.

165
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,620
\hHIS FAMILY SEEMS TO SHOW
UP JUST AROUND LUNCHTIME.

166
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,530
MRS. GARFIELD, WHO SNORES
\h\h\h\hLIKE A SAINT BERNARD,

167
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:22,730
\h\h\hAND THE WINDSOR SISTERS, WHO
SPEND HALF THEIR TIME GIGGLING,

168
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,900
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT.

169
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,370
AND THERE'S OUR RESIDENT
\h\h\h\hNUTCASE, MR. WEAVER.

170
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,840
\hHE RARELY LEAVES HIS ROOM,
WHICH IS JUST FINE WITH ME.

171
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,180
\h\h\h\hHE'S BEST LEFT ALONE IN
HIS OWN LITTLE CUCKOO LAND.

172
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,650
WELL, I THINK I'D
LIKE TO MEET HIM.

173
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,150
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTHIS IS THE NEW
ADMINISTRATOR, MR. WEAVER.

174
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,890
ONE MOMENT.

175
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:54,400
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT STAGE.

176
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,560
TAH-DAH.

177
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,730
\hYOU KNOW I HAVE ALWAYS
WONDERED HOW THAT'S DONE.

178
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:03,940
WELL, IT'S A SECRET, WHICH I
HOPE YOU CAN BE TRUSTED WITH.

179
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,240
ABSOLUTELY.

180
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,410
NOW, WHO DID YOU SAY YOU WERE?

181
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,580
\h\h\hI'M PAULA WELLS,
THE NEW ADMINISTRATOR.

182
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,880
WELL, HELLO, PAULA WELLS.

183
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,220
YOU LOOK LIKE A FINE
YOUNG WOMAN, STRONG,

184
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,250
BUT NOT TOO STRONG.

185
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,420
WE SHOULD BE GOING.

186
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,020
\h\hTHERE ARE PLENTY OF
RESIDENTS LEFT TO MEET,

187
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:28,660
\h\hAND IT'S NEARLY NAP
TIME FOR MOST OF THEM.

188
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,960
YOU COME BACK AND SEE ME.

189
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,700
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO
\h\hRIG THE MAINSAIL.

190
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,870
AYE, AYE, CAPTAIN.

191
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,340
MISS WELLS.

192
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,840
(dog barking)

193
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:44,290
THAT'S IT.

194
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,580
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THESE DOGS.

195
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,320
THEY'RE JUST HUNGRY, THAT'S ALL.

196
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,620
\h\h\hWELL, WE CAN'T
AFFORD TO FEED THEM.

197
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,350
\h\h\h\h\h\hTHERE'S A CREEK ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THESE WOODS.

198
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,820
WE SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE
THEM AND THROW THEM IN.

199
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,120
WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING?

200
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,860
\h\h\hTHEY'RE LITTLE
DOGS, THEY'LL DROWN.

201
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,160
IT'S THE BEST THING TO DO.

202
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,890
\h\h\h\h\h\hWELL, THE BEST THING TO DO
WOULD BE TO FIND HOMES FOR THEM.

203
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,630
AND TELL THE WHOLE WORLD
THAT WE HAVE THE DOGS

204
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,360
THAT WERE LEFT IN THIS CAR?

205
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,230
I DON'T LIKE IT ANY
\hBETTER THAN YOU,

206
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,530
BUT WE HAVE TO BE HUMANE

207
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:09,440
AND PUT THESE POOR DOGS
\hOUT OF THEIR MISERY.

208
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,300
YOU DO IT.

209
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,350
ME?

210
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,390
STUPID DOGS.

211
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,660
I'M SORRY ABOUT FRANCIS.

212
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,990
HE'S NOT A BAD GUY, HE
\hJUST -- I DON'T KNOW,

213
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,030
HE'S HAD A TOUGH LIFE.

214
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,070
SEE, FRANCIS --

215
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,840
FRANCIS THINKS BEING A NICE GUY
\hMAKES HIM LOOK LIKE A SISSY.

216
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,010
IT'S JUST HARD TO EXPLAIN.

217
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,740
(dogs whining)

218
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,480
AH.

219
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,380
OH, MAN.

220
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,750
OH, NO.

221
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,660
NO.

222
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:14,500
YEAH.

223
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,100
I THINK I'M GOING TO
LEAVE YOU GUYS HERE.

224
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,850
\h\hMAYBE SOMEBODY
NICE WILL FIND YOU.

225
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,010
HEY, I KNOW.

226
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,480
YEAH, HERE, HAVE A SNACK.

227
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,080
YEAH, YOU GUYS WANT A SNACK?

228
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,820
YEAH, YOU LOOK LIKE
\hYOU WANT A SNACK.

229
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,250
HEY, HEY, HEY.

230
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,420
SHARE, SHARE, SHARE, SHARE.

231
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,150
SHARE, SHARE.

232
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,190
(horn honking in distance)

233
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,560
HOW'D IT GO?

234
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,880
OKAY.

235
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,340
IT'S THE BEST THING
\h\hFOR THEM, REALLY.

236
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:52,240
(engine not starting)

237
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,280
WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

238
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,350
WHAT'S THIS?

239
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,080
ROBOT VACUUM CLEANER.

240
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,550
REALLY?

241
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,720
\hHOW MUCH IS THIS
REMOTE CONTROL CAR?

242
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,590
TEN BUCKS.

243
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,760
IT NEEDS BATTERIES.

244
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,060
WHAT ARE THESE?

245
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,100
NIGHT VISION GOGGLES.

246
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,270
YOU GOING TO BUY SOMETHING,
KID, OR JUST ASK QUESTIONS?

247
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,570
LET ME LOOK AROUND A LITTLE.

248
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,900
HELP YOURSELF.

249
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,080
ARE WE GOING TO CALL THE OWNERS
AND TELL THEM WHERE THE CAR IS?

250
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,370
YOU PROMISED.

251
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,990
YES, BUT NOT 'TIL
WE GET IT FIXED.

252
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,150
WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE THEM
BACK A BROKEN CAR, DO WE?

253
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,050
LOOK, ALL THIS MEANS IS THAT WE
WERE MEANT TO BE AROUND HERE,

254
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,520
FOR AT LEAST A WHILE.

255
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,100
OW!

256
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,270
\h\hWATCH WHERE YOU'RE
GOING, YOU DUMB KID.

257
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,740
MAYBE THAT WILL SLOW YOU DOWN.

258
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,610
YOU BROKE IT.

259
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,340
YEAH, WELL TOO BAD.

260
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,510
NOW BEAT IT.

261
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,380
SORRY.

262
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,980
HEY, COME ON, FRANK, WHY
YOU GOT TO BE SO MEAN?

263
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,020
COME ON, I WAS JUST
\h\hCLOWNING THE KID.

264
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,190
\hI DIDN'T MEAN TO WRECK
HIS SCOOTER, ALL RIGHT?

265
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,360
HE PRACTICALLY TORE MY LEG OFF.

266
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,090
COME ON.

267
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,830
LET'S GO GET A HOT DOG.

268
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,000
I'LL BUY.

269
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:04,110
(dogs whining)

270
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,480
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
GUYS DOING HERE?

271
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,780
HELLO?

272
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,950
HELLO!

273
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,120
\h\h\hI WISH I COULD
BRING YOU GUYS HOME.

274
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,850
BUT MY MOM WON'T LET ME.

275
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,320
MY SISTER'S AFRAID OF DOGS.

276
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,170
COME ON.

277
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:35,340
HEY, GUYS.

278
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:39,240
HEY.

279
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,980
LET'S GO.

280
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:45,310
(dogs barking)

281
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,920
COME ON.

282
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,220
I HAVE TO GET HOME.

283
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,520
I HOPE WHOEVER OWNS YOU GUYS

284
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,560
COMES TO PICK YOU UP
\h\h\hBEFORE DINNER.

285
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,160
\h\h\h\hI'LL COME BACK
TOMORROW TO MAKE SURE.

286
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,890
BYE!

287
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:39,980
(dogs barking and whining)

288
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,310
SORRY, GUYS.

289
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,780
THIS STINKS.

290
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,220
STAY HERE.

291
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,520
YOU DON'T BELONG TO ME.

292
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,820
I'M SERIOUS.

293
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:08,160
MY MOM WOULD KILL ME IF I CAME
\h\hHOME WITH A COUPLE OF DOGS.

294
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,900
NOW, STAY HERE.

295
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,200
IT'S TOUGH LOVE TIME.

296
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,230
I DON'T WANT YOU GUYS.

297
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,550
NO.

298
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,710
YOU CAN'T COME WITH ME.

299
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,870
I MEAN IT.

300
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,040
NO.

301
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,920
OH, NO, IT'S MY MOM!

302
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,390
QUICK, LET'S DUCK IN HERE.

303
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,900
HEY, STOP THAT.

304
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,370
THIS IS A DOCTOR'S OFFICE.

305
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,440
THE DOCTOR WILL BE WITH YOU
IN A MINUTE, MRS. POLLING.

306
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,740
OH, IT'S OKAY.

307
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,910
MY COUGH SEEMS TO
HAVE CLEARED UP.

308
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,520
IT'S THE DARNDEST THING.

309
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,250
I'LL CALL YOU IF
THERE'S ANY CHANGE.

310
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,120
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

311
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,850
CASSIDY, THIS DOG IS NOT YOURS.

312
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,590
\hDO I NEED TO REMIND
YOU THAT YOU'RE SICK?

313
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,890
NO, I'M NOT, MOMMY.

314
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,620
I FEEL ALL BETTER.

315
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,940
LOOK.

316
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,530
OH, MY GOSH, YOUR FEVER'S GONE.

317
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,700
CAN I GO BACK TO SCHOOL?

318
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,000
ARE YOU SURE
YOU FEEL OKAY?

319
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,170
YEAH.

320
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:23,200
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL, YES, YOU ARE.

321
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,810
YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.

322
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,410
HEY.

323
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:31,450
SAY SOMETHING INTO THIS EAR.

324
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,610
SOMETHING INTO THIS EAR.

325
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:34,920
AMAZING.

326
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,220
MY ACHE IS GONE.

327
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,250
I MEAN, THE EARACHE
\hIS TOTALLY GONE.

328
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:44,460
\h\h\hBONNIE, CALL THE DOC
AND TELL HIM -- NEVER MIND.

329
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,060
BUT I --

330
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,660
WHO ARE YOU?

331
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,270
JUST SOME KID THAT
\h\hYOU DON'T KNOW.

332
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,570
ARE THOSE YOUR DOGS?

333
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,740
THESE?

334
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,040
NO.

335
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,210
\h\hBECAUSE THERE ARE NO DOGS
ALLOWED IN THE WAITING ROOM.

336
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,070
OKAY.

337
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:03,540
BYE.

338
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,580
THAT'S WEIRD.

339
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,220
COME ON, PUPPIES.

340
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,690
COME ON.

341
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,470
YOU GUYS CAN STAY HERE FOR THE
NIGHT, BUT YOU CAN'T LIVE HERE.

342
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,640
I'LL BRING YOU SOME FOOD LATER.

343
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,380
YOU'VE GOT TO STAY HERE.

344
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:41,280
YOU'VE GOT TO BE QUIET.

345
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,350
I REALLY APPRECIATE THE PRESENT,

346
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,140
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hBUT DOES IT HAVE
TO VACUUM ALL DAY LONG?

347
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,200
(vacuum stops)

348
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,370
THANK YOU.

349
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,100
CAN YOU EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO ME?

350
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,400
UH, WHAT?

351
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,440
WHY IS YOUR SHIRT SO DIRTY?

352
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,610
IT'S JUST A SMUDGE.

353
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,210
IT KIND OF LOOKS
LIKE A PAW PRINT.

354
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,380
UH, WHAT?

355
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,550
WHY WOULD -- NAH.

356
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,720
IT'S JUST A SMUDGE.

357
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,750
\h\hYOU KNOW WHAT, WHY DON'T WE
EAT PIZZA SOMEWHERE THIS WEEK.

358
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,070
YOU KNOW WHAT?

359
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,220
\h\hI BET THERE'S A REALLY GOOD
PIZZA PLACE SOMEWHERE IN TOWN.

360
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:28,570
YEAH, PIZZA WILL BE GOOD.

361
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,170
OKAY.

362
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,940
SARAH, WHAT ABOUT YOU, YOU
\hMADE ANY NEW FRIENDS YET?

363
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,970
THE BOY ACROSS THE STREET
\h\h\hSEEMS REALLY NICE.

364
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,270
HE'S A JOCK.

365
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:44,610
OH, RIGHT, THAT WILL NEVER DO.

366
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:45,910
MOM?

367
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,210
HMM?

368
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:50,250
YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU SAID THAT
WHEN I TURN 11 I CAN GET A DOG?

369
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,300
\h\h\hI SAID THAT WE'D TALK
ABOUT IT WHEN YOU TURN 13.

370
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,320
WELL, I'LL BE 11 IN ONE
\hMONTH AND FOUR DAYS.

371
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,060
\h\hI ALSO SAID WE HAD
TO HAVE A BIG BACKYARD

372
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,360
\hWITH A SEPARATE
SPOT FOR THE DOG,

373
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,660
SO THE DOG WON'T BOTHER SARAH,

374
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,400
AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT YET.

375
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,260
I CAN BUILD A FENCE.

376
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,430
NO DOGS, MOM.

377
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,730
DOGS ARE DANGEROUS.

378
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,900
NO, THEY AREN'T.

379
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,200
NOT IF YOU RAISE THEM RIGHT.

380
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,940
UNCLE AUTO'S DOG
WAS RAISED RIGHT,

381
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,670
AND THAT DOG BIT ME
\hRIGHT IN THE EYE.

382
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,410
YOU WEREN'T EVEN BORN YET.

383
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,010
NOW I'M DISFIGURED FOR LIFE.

384
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,750
SARAH, DON'T BE SILLY.

385
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,780
YOU ARE A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN.

386
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,080
\h\hAND THE MINUTE YOU
START TO BELIEVE THAT,

387
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,690
\h\h\hYOU'RE GOING
TO BE VERY POPULAR.

388
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,860
YOU MIGHT EVEN HAVE
\hA NICE BOYFRIEND.

389
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,590
A BOYFRIEND?

390
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:34,060
WHY WOULD I EVEN WANT ONE?

391
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,970
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
\h\hME GETTING A DOG.

392
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,270
I'M FINISHED.

393
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,440
CAN I BE EXCUSED?

394
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,040
SURE.

395
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:56,620
\h\h\h\h\hTHERE, THAT IS MUCH
BETTER, DON'T YOU THINK?

396
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,350
OH, YES, MUCH BETTER.

397
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,220
EXCUSE ME.

398
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,520
OH.

399
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,740
WE KEEP THIS ROOM DARK BECAUSE
\h\hTHE LIGHT CAN HURT OLD EYES.

400
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,460
OH.

401
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,630
I THINK A FEW HOURS
A DAY IS OKAY.

402
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,800
IT'S MUCH CHEERIER.

403
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,530
IT'S GOING TO GIVE
\h\h\h\hME A MIGRAINE.

404
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,270
I JUST KNOW IT.

405
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,870
BUT NURSE BLEAKER,
WHAT'S WITH THE MUSIC?

406
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:21,340
IT'S SO OLD.

407
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,810
\h\hIT'S MONTE VINO,
MY OWN COLLECTION.

408
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,410
I FIND IT RELAXES THE RESIDENTS.

409
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,150
PERHAPS YOU CAN FIND
SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE FUN.

410
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,320
\h\h\h\h\hI REALLY DON'T
THINK OUR RESIDENTS

411
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,350
NEED A MAJOR CHANGE
\h\hIN THEIR ROUTINE.

412
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:38,260
IN ANY CASE, I CAME HERE TO TELL
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYOU THAT OUR HOUSE DOCTOR

413
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,990
IS COMING HERE TO MAKE
\h\h\h\h\hHIS ROUNDS TODAY.

414
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,300
OH, GREAT.

415
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,030
DON'T GET TOO EXCITED.

416
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,500
HE CALLS HIMSELF DR. JEFF.

417
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,540
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF
\h\hA DOCTOR NAMED JEFF?

418
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,710
\h\hHE'S A BACHELOR
WITH AN ATTITUDE.

419
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,010
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTHERE'S EVEN
A RUMOR GOING AROUND

420
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:55,610
\h\h\h\h\h\hTHAT HE'S NOT
EVEN A REAL DOCTOR.

421
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:59,080
HE CERTAINLY DOESN'T
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hACT LIKE ONE.

422
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,850
FOR YOU, BLEAKER, A PRETTY
\hFLOWER FOR A PRETTY LADY.

423
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:08,190
HMM, DO YOU KNOW WHAT IN
WILL DO TO MY HAY FEVER?

424
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,060
NOT MUCH.

425
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,660
IT'S PLASTIC.

426
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,390
HELLO.

427
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,130
HI.

428
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,860
\h\h\h\hOH, YOU MUST BE
THE NEW ADMINISTRATOR.

429
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,600
THIS IS MISS WELLS.

430
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,500
YOU KNOW WHO HE IS.

431
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,540
\h\h\h\hGOOD OLD BLEAKER, SHE'S
A BIT OF AN ACQUIRED TASTE,

432
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:26,840
BUT SHE'S OKAY.

433
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:30,310
\h\hPROBABLY JUST NEEDS TO LOOSEN
UP THOSE HAIR PINS A LITTLE BIT.

434
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,910
HMM.

435
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:35,080
WHY DO YOU LOOK FAMILIAR?

436
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,550
I'M THE ROAD HOG WHO
DRIVES LIKE A MANIAC.

437
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:38,990
OH, NO.

438
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,720
MM-HMM.

439
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,590
THAT WAS YOU?

440
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,460
YEAH.

441
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,760
AND YOU KNOW WHAT,

442
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,490
\h\hYOU'RE THE JAYWALKER WHO
DOESN'T FOLLOW TRAFFIC LAWS.

443
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,790
WELL, NOW, HANG ON A SECOND.

444
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,530
WE'RE NOT USED TO CARS ROARING
DOWN THE MIDDLE OF MAIN STREET

445
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,400
IN SUCH A HURRY.

446
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:50,700
SO THAT'S WHY YOU STARTED
\hSCREAMING AND POUNDING

447
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,000
ON MY HOOD?

448
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,300
I'LL GIVE THAT ONE TO YOU.

449
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,470
\h\h\hIT'S JUST I WAS
HAVING A BAD MORNING.

450
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,640
\h\hI HAD JUST GOTTEN OFF
THE PHONE WITH MY FATHER,

451
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,670
WHO, LIKE ALWAYS --
IT'S A LONG STORY.

452
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,980
WELCOME TO HOPE SPRINGS.

453
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:05,450
THANKS.

454
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,180
WELL, DON'T LET ME KEEP
YOU FROM YOUR ROUNDS.

455
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,490
JOIN ME?

456
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,220
NO.

457
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,080
NO, THANKS.

458
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,830
\hI'VE GOT A LOT OF
CATCHING UP TO DO.

459
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,120
\hWELL, IT'S JUST THAT
SOME OF THE RESIDENTS,

460
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,860
\h\h\hTHEY TEND TO SCREAM
WHEN THEY SEE ME COMING,

461
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,460
AND YOUR PRESENCE MIGHT HAVE
A CALMING INFLUENCE ON THEM.

462
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,760
AND I THINK IT MIGHT
\hBE HELPFUL FOR YOU

463
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,930
TO GET THE 411 ON SOME OF
\hTHE MEDICAL CONDITIONS

464
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:26,270
THAT WE'RE TREATING AROUND HERE,
\hBUT IF YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED...

465
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,770
OH, DEAR, IT'S JUST AS I FEARED.

466
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,510
WHAT IS IT?

467
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,380
WHAT?

468
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:41,010
THIS WOMAN,
THIS DEAR WOMAN...

469
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,190
NEEDS TO BE TICKLED!

470
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,480
HOO-HOO-HOO-HOO!

471
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,360
WOO-HOO-HOO-HOO-HOO!

472
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,090
HAH, HAH, HAH!

473
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,390
I HAD YOU FOOLED FOR A MINUTE.

474
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,430
THAT IS THE OLDEST TRICK
\hIN THE BOOK, ELIZABETH.

475
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,590
DID YOU BRING ME
SOMETHING NICE?

476
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,760
WELL, THAT DEPENDS.

477
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,370
HOW DOES CHOCOLATE
\hSPRINKLES SOUND?

478
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,840
CHOCOLATE SPRINKLES,
\h\h\h\hMY FAVORITE.

479
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,570
MMM.

480
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,870
HOW WE FEELING?

481
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,910
OH, A LITTLE STIFF HERE
AND THERE, BUT I'M OLD,

482
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,510
IT COMES WITH THE TERRITORY.

483
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,250
ARE YOU STILL TAKING
\h\h\h\h\h\hYOUR VITAMINS?

484
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,550
EVERY DAY.

485
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,150
WELL, YOU KEEP THAT UP,
\hAND MAYBE, JUST MAYBE,

486
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:20,920
\h\h\h\hNEXT TIME I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO SWING A FEW MINT TRUFFLES.

487
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,090
MMM, MINT TRUFFLES.

488
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,390
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

489
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,860
SHHH.

490
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,600
CHOCOLATE.

491
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,900
THESE ARE WONDERFUL PEOPLE.

492
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,630
YOU COULD LEARN ALL YOU
NEED TO KNOW ABOUT LIFE

493
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:36,100
IF YOU KEEP YOUR EARS
OPEN AROUND THIS PLACE.

494
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,710
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hZack:
THE PROBLEM IS MY SISTER.

495
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,180
IT'S NOT THAT SHE'S A PROBLEM,
\hIT'S JUST THAT SHE'S A GIRL.

496
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:45,650
\h\hBUT I BET IF SHE MET
YOU, SHE WOULD LIKE YOU.

497
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,950
YOU GUYS LOOK HUNGRY.

498
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,550
YOU WANT SOMETHING TO EAT?

499
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:56,490
THIS IS FROM MY ALLOWANCE,
\h\h\h\hSO DON'T GO CRAZY.

500
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,230
I'M STILL TRYING
TO THINK OF A WAY

501
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,390
\h\h\hTO GET MY MOM
TO LET ME KEEP YOU.

502
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,130
BUT I GUESS SHE'S GOT
A LOT OF OTHER THINGS

503
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:05,170
ON HER MIND RIGHT NOW.

504
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:19,480
PERMISSION TO COME
\h\hABOARD, CAPTAIN.

505
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,080
AHOY, SAWBONES.

506
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,820
\h\h\hI HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN
THESE WATERS FOR SOME TIME.

507
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,120
NO.

508
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,290
THAT'S BECAUSE LAST TIME I
WAS HERE YOU WERE SLEEPING.

509
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,460
HOW YOU FEELING, PETE?

510
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,060
\h\h\hOH, I HAVE GOOD
DAYS AND BAD DAYS.

511
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:32,930
HEY, DID YOU NOTICE
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTHAT WE HAVE

512
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:35,960
A NEW AND VERY PRETTY
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hADMINISTRATOR?

513
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,700
YOU KNOW WHAT, I DID NOTICE.

514
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,000
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

515
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,870
HUH?

516
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:43,340
\hI THINK THAT YOU
AND HER SHOULD --

517
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:48,540
(snoring)

518
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:52,010
I GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW.

519
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,180
MR. WEAVER'S VERY ILL.

520
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,780
\hHE DECIDED TO DISCONTINUE
TREATMENT A FEW WEEKS AGO,

521
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:00,690
SO I'M AFRAID HE'S NOT GOING
\h\hTO BE WITH US MUCH LONGER.

522
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:04,590
FORTUNATELY, HE'S
\hNOT IN ANY PAIN.

523
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,270
\h\h\hWELL, IT'S NICE TO
MEET YOU, MRS. WELLS.

524
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,570
MISS, ACTUALLY.

525
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,600
OH, IS IT?

526
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,470
HI.

527
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,340
HI, MOM.

528
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,210
OH, HI.

529
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,380
THIS IS MY DAUGHTER, SARAH.

530
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,680
SARAH, THIS IS DR. JEFF.

531
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,850
HI.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hHELLO, SARAH.

532
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,450
MOM, CAN I BORROW THE CAR?

533
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,180
THERE'S A COOL MALL
\hOVER IN ROSSDALE,

534
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,480
AND I NEED SCHOOL CLOTHES.

535
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,360
ROSSDALE?

536
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:32,790
NO, NO, NO.

537
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,960
THAT'S 15 MILES AWAY.

538
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,260
WE DISCUSSED THIS,

539
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,430
\hNO DRIVING ALONE UNTIL
YOU'VE HAD MORE PRACTICE.

540
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,160
\h\hWE CAN GO THIS
WEEKEND, TOGETHER.

541
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:43,630
I'M 16, I CAN'T GO TO
THE MALL WITH MY MOM.

542
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,800
OH.

543
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,400
TRUE, THAT IS A PROBLEM.

544
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,140
WELL, I DON'T KNOW,

545
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,740
\hMAYBE I CAN DROP YOU OFF
WITHOUT ANYBODY SEEING ME.

546
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,910
(scoffing)

547
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:57,940
WE'LL DISCUSS THIS LATER.

548
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,560
GREAT SHADES.

549
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,020
OH, DO YOU LIKE HIM?

550
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,880
DR. JEFF?

551
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,500
WELL, HE'S NICE.

552
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,980
MOM?

553
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:41,320
COOL.

554
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,130
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

555
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,430
PUT THOSE BACK!

556
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,170
COME BACK HERE!

557
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,200
YOU LITTLE THIEF!

558
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,120
WHOA!

559
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,020
DARN NEAR SCARED
ME TO DEATH, BOY.

560
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,760
I'M SORRY.

561
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,060
SOMEONE WAS CHASING ME.

562
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,790
WERE THEY NOW?

563
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:25,130
AND DID SHE HAVE BLACK HAIR,

564
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:29,900
AND EYES DARK AND FIERCE
\h\h\h\h\h\hLIKE A SHARK,

565
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,200
AND A LITTLE FUNNY HAT?

566
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,080
YES.

567
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,810
DON'T WORRY, SON,
YOU'RE SAFE HERE.

568
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,140
NURSE BLEAKER DOESN'T DARE
\h\hMESS WITH CAPTAIN PETE,

569
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,760
AND THAT'S ME.

570
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,050
YOU HAVE A NAME YOURSELF?

571
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:44,220
ZACK, ZACK WELLS.

572
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,390
AND WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?

573
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,560
OH, SOME COOKIES.

574
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,290
THEY WERE ON A CART
\h\hIN THE HALLWAY.

575
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,030
I DIDN'T MEAN TO STEAL THEM.

576
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,060
WHAT'S FREE CAN'T BE STOLE.

577
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:58,100
THINK I CAN HAVE ONE?

578
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,870
ZACK WELLS, YOU SAY.

579
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,470
\hNOW, WHY DOES THAT
NAME SOUND FAMILIAR?

580
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,340
MY MOM WORKS HERE.

581
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:10,680
OH, MISS WELLS.

582
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,850
NOW THERE'S A FINE FRIEND,

583
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,880
AND A RIGHT PRETTY LADY, TOO,
IF YOU DON'T MIND MY SAYING.

584
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,490
I THINK SHE'S PRETTY, TOO.

585
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:30,630
THEMS THE PLANETS AND THE STARS.

586
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:39,310
YEP, THAT'S SATURN AND JUPITER,
\h\hAND THERE'S THE BIG DIPPER,

587
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,040
AND THAT'S THE NORTH STAR.

588
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,210
\h\h\h\hCaptain Pete:
WELL, I AM IMPRESSED.

589
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,380
YOU KNOW YOUR STARS.

590
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,680
I KNOW A LITTLE.

591
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,980
I'D LIKE TO KNOW MORE.

592
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,450
\hWELL, YOU CAN LEARN
A LOT FROM THE STARS.

593
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:55,790
THEY'LL TELL YOU WHERE YOU
\hARE, WHERE YOU CAME FROM,

594
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,390
\hAND IF YOU LOOK WITH
THE RIGHT KIND OF EYES,

595
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:04,460
YOU CAN SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING
\hJUST BY LOOKING AT THE STARS.

596
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,200
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

597
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,930
OF COURSE.

598
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:12,270
WHAT IF SOMEONE FOUND SOMETHING

599
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:16,180
AND MAYBE THAT SOMETHING
BELONGS TO SOMEONE ELSE,

600
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,910
BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW FOR SURE?

601
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:21,380
HEY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
\hTALK IN RIDDLES, SON.

602
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,980
A MAN CAN SPEAK HIS MIND HERE.

603
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,890
\h\hI FOUND A COUPLE OF
LITTLE DOGS THE FOREST.

604
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:32,230
SOMEONE HAD LEFT THEM IN A CAGE,
\h\h\hAND THEY FOLLOWED ME HOME.

605
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,830
\h\h\hWHAT SCOUNDREL
WOULD ABANDON A DOG?

606
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:37,000
IT'S A TERRIBLE BUSINESS.

607
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,170
IT'S A GOOD THING A BOY
\hLIKE YOU CAME ALONG.

608
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,900
I GUESS.

609
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,510
MY MOM WON'T LET ME
KEEP THEM, THOUGH,

610
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,670
BECAUSE MY SISTER'S
\h\hAFRAID OF DOGS.

611
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,270
OH, NOW THAT IS A QUANDARY.

612
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,020
\hZack: THEY'RE IN MY
CLUBHOUSE RIGHT NOW.

613
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:54,350
\h\h\hBUT IF MY MOM FINDS THEM,
SHE'LL MAKE ME GET RID OF THEM.

614
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:57,380
\h\hI NEED A PLACE TO HIDE THEM
UNTIL I CAN THINK OF SOMETHING.

615
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:03,460
\hWELL, IF IT WILL HELP, I HAVE A
CLOSET THERE THAT I AIN'T USING,

616
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,930
\h\hSO YOUR DOGS WILL BE SAFE
UNTIL YOU DECIDE WHAT TO DO,

617
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:09,100
AND I THINK YOU'LL
DO THE RIGHT THING.

618
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,530
DO YOU MEAN IT?

619
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,830
OF COURSE.

620
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,130
BRING THEM BY AFTER 6:00,

621
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:15,170
\h\hBECAUSE THAT'S WHEN
OLD BLEAKER GOES HOME.

622
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:18,640
\hI'M HAPPY TO HELP
A NEW FRIEND, ZACK.

623
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:23,410
THANKS, CAPTAIN.

624
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,780
\h\h\hNurse Bleaker:
YES, I GOT YOUR POEM.

625
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:35,990
THERE WERE FOUR MISSPELLINGS
\h\hIN THE FIRST TWO STANZAS.

626
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:36,860
IF YOU'RE GOING TO SEND A POEM,

627
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,590
\h\hYOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

628
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:42,060
THE SPELLING IS CORRECT.

629
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:43,800
FINE.

630
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,970
YES.

631
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,270
YES, I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

632
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,440
TALK TO YOU LATER.

633
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,070
\hSarah:
WOO-HOO!

634
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,120
YEAH!

635
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:01,150
WOO!

636
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:05,920
WOO-HOO!

637
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,090
WOO!

638
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:11,990
(music playing over headphones)

639
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,230
WOO!

640
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,570
WOO!

641
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:28,910
WOO-HOO, YEAH!

642
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:38,020
(music ends abruptly)

643
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,920
HELLO.

644
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,090
NICE MOVES.

645
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:46,260
YOU'RE A GOOD DANCER.

646
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,730
HOW ABOUT YOU, YOU PROBABLY
\h\h\h\hHAVE A NAME, RIGHT?

647
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,030
SARAH.

648
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,330
SARAH.

649
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,630
I LIKE THAT NAME.

650
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:56,240
I LIKE YOUR DANCING, TOO.

651
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,840
I WISH I COULD DANCE LIKE THAT.

652
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:02,310
\h\h\h\hSPEAKING OF WHICH,
THERE'S A DANCE THIS FRIDAY

653
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,610
AT THE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM

654
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:06,210
\h\hBEFORE THE NEW
SCHOOL YEAR STARTS.

655
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:09,250
IF YOU WANT TO COME, I COULD
INTRODUCE YOU TO SOME PEOPLE.

656
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,980
\h\hMAYBE YOU COULD
MAKE SOME FRIENDS.

657
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,020
I DON'T EXACTLY GET ALONG
\h\h\hWITH THE POPULAR KIDS,

658
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,490
AND YOU'RE PROBABLY
ONE OF THEM, RIGHT?

659
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:24,000
I GUESS, BUT I DIDN'T ASK TO BE.

660
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,300
AND I SHOOT A PRETTY
\hGOOD THREE-POINTER,

661
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,200
SO EVERYONE TREATS ME LIKE I'M
SPECIAL, BUT TRUST ME, I'M NOT.

662
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,970
ONE THING I KNOW IS, DON'T TRUST
\h\hANYONE WHO SAYS, "TRUST ME."

663
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,890
AH, OKAY.

664
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,050
CAUGHT YOU ON A BAD DAY.

665
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:42,650
THAT'S COOL.

666
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:45,250
MAYBE WE COULD TALK
\hSOME OTHER TIME.

667
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,120
YEAH.

668
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,020
I'M GOING TO LEAVE.

669
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:59,130
SARAH, YOU IDIOT.

670
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,300
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hPaula:
SO HOW'S IT GOING, FRANCES?

671
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,470
JUST FINE, MISS WELLS.

672
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:06,940
MM-HMM, OKAY, EXCUSE ME, BYE.

673
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,810
HELLO.

674
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:09,540
ROCKIN' OLDIES, PAULA SPEAKING.

675
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,840
\hDr. Jeff:
YOU HUNGRY?

676
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,710
WHO IS THIS?

677
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,310
\hIT'S JEFF, THE GUY
WITH THE STETHOSCOPE.

678
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:14,750
HI.

679
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,480
HELLO.

680
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,780
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

681
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,090
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

682
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:19,950
THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING
OFF ON THE WRONG FOOT.

683
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:23,860
THE FACT IS IS THAT I WAS
JAYWALKING THE OTHER DAY,

684
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:28,190
AND I APOLOGIZE.

685
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,500
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

686
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:29,930
THAT'S GOOD.

687
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,230
I FEEL BETTER.

688
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,400
AND EVEN THOUGH IT
WAS ALL YOUR FAULT,

689
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:36,870
I WOULD FEEL EVEN BETTER IF YOU
\h\h\hLET ME MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

690
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,170
MAKE IT UP TO ME.

691
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,910
HOW?

692
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:42,940
\h\hBY LETTING ME TAKE
YOU TO DINNER TONIGHT.

693
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,550
TONIGHT?

694
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,410
REALLY?

695
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:49,450
BUT ONLY IF YOU'RE HUNGRY,
\h\h\h\hBECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

696
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,180
IT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY
\h\h\h\hBE A DATE THING.

697
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:58,120
IT'S MORE LIKE TWO PEOPLE
\h\hEATING FOOD TOGETHER.

698
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:02,460
RIGHT.

699
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,500
HELLO?

700
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,370
YEAH.

701
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,100
YEAH, SORRY.

702
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:12,870
\h\h\hI WAS JUST SWITCHING
THE PHONE TO THE OTHER EAR.

703
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:15,040
PICK YOU UP IN 20 MINUTES?

704
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,780
CAN YOU MAKE IT 30?

705
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:19,810
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

706
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,670
\h\hFrankie:
HELLO, THERE.

707
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:49,310
\h\h\hI SAW YOU SITTING HERE BY
YOURSELF AND -- I DON'T KNOW --

708
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:51,480
\hTHOUGHT YOU MIGHT
LIKE SOME COMPANY.

709
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,080
NOT REALLY.

710
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:57,550
NICE PARK.

711
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:00,150
I'M FRANKIE.

712
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,890
YOU LIVE AROUND HERE?

713
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:02,760
I GUESS SO.

714
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,060
YOU GUESS SO.

715
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,790
THAT'S FUNNY.

716
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:09,260
SO, LIKE, WHAT DO YOU DO?

717
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,860
ARE YOU A MODEL OR SOMETHING?

718
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:12,740
A MODEL?

719
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,600
NO, YOU'RE NOT A MODEL?

720
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,030
PLEASE.

721
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,770
ACTRESS.

722
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:16,640
NOT EVEN.

723
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,370
WELL, YOU SHOULD BE.

724
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,420
SERIOUSLY, THERE ARE GIRLS
MAKING A FORTUNE AS MODELS

725
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:24,880
WHO AREN'T HALF AS GOOD
LOOKING AS YOU.

726
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:30,950
YOU GOT NICE STRUCTURE.

727
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,960
WOW, YOU'RE GOOD.

728
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,830
THANKS.

729
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:47,430
BEEN PLAYING SINCE I WAS SEVEN.

730
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,600
ACTUALLY, I'M ON THE VERGE
OF GETTING A RECORD DEAL.

731
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,040
REALLY?

732
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,340
YEAH.

733
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,370
THERE'S, LIKE, SIX
COMPANIES TRYING TO SIGN ME.

734
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:57,410
I'M JUST, YOU KNOW, NOT SURE
IF I'M READY FOR THE FAME.

735
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,580
I'M A SIMPLE GUY.

736
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,750
BUT THEY SAY I'M
GOING TO BE HUGE,

737
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:05,220
SO, I GUESS I'LL JUST
HAVE TO GET USED TO IT.

738
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:07,820
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hIT MUST BE NICE GETTING
SOMETHING YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED.

739
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,420
HEY, I WAS GOING TO
GO GET SOME ICE CREAM.

740
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,720
YOU WANT TO JOIN ME?

741
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,170
(cell phone ringing)

742
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,330
HELLO?

743
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,630
HI, MOM.

744
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:19,970
OH, JUST SITTING
\h\hIN THE PARK.

745
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,700
OKAY.

746
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:25,170
OKAY.

747
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,210
OH, MY MOM, SHE'S OUT ON A DATE.

748
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,940
I HAVE TO GO HOME AND MAKE
\h\h\h\hDINNER FOR MY BROTHER.

749
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,680
AND HOW ABOUT THAT
ICE CREAM OFFER?

750
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,980
I DON'T THINK SO.

751
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,150
MY MOM WOULD NEVER LET
\hME DATE AN OLDER GUY.

752
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,450
WELL, IF YOU ASK ME,

753
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,920
I THINK SHE DOESN'T REALIZE HOW
SOPHISTICATED YOU REALLY ARE.

754
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,260
I'D BETTER GO.

755
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:52,500
ANYWAYS, I'M ONLY
19 -- AND A HALF.

756
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,530
WELL, IF YOU DON'T LIKE MOVIES,
\hWE COULD JUST GO FOR A DRIVE.

757
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,850
\h\h\hI'LL GET A COUPLE
OF MEATBALL SANDWICHES

758
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,010
AND COME PICK YOU UP AND --

759
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:03,780
\h\h\h\hWELL, WHO SAID
ANYTHING ABOUT PARKING?

760
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,190
NO.

761
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:25,030
(music box playing)

762
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,480
SIR?

763
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,350
HANG ON.

764
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,650
YEAH.

765
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:43,250
DO YOU THINK THOSE DOGS COULD
\h\hBE HERE IN HOPE SPRINGS?

766
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,850
\h\hTHAT'S A DALLAS PAPER,
A HUNDRED MILES FROM HERE.

767
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,020
I JUST HUNG IT UP BECAUSE
\h\h\hI LIKE THE PICTURE.

768
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:48,890
SORRY.

769
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:50,190
SO IF SOMEONE FOUND DOGS

770
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,360
THAT LOOK A LOT LIKE
\h\hTHAT AROUND HERE,

771
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,530
\h\h\h\hTHEY CAN'T BE
THE SAME DOGS; RIGHT?

772
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:55,830
HANG ON.

773
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:58,000
I DON'T SEE HOW THAT COULD
\hBE, BUT I'M ON THE PHONE.

774
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,860
OKAY?

775
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:02,350
THE MUSIC BOX IS FIVE BUCKS.

776
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:09,710
(car radio blaring)

777
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,010
AREN'T WE GOING A LITTLE FAST?

778
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,750
WE'RE BARELY DOING 30.

779
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,050
YOU'RE NOT SCARED, ARE YOU?

780
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:14,910
NO.

781
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:15,780
NO, NO, NO.

782
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,080
GOOD.

783
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,380
(engine revs)

784
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,420
(screaming)

785
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,890
(laughing)

786
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:33,130
WE MARRIED YOUNG, TOO YOUNG.

787
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,870
IT TURNS OUT
HE LOVED HIS JOB

788
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,340
MORE THAN HE
LOVED BEING MARRIED.

789
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,640
THAT'S OKAY.

790
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,540
\h\h\hHE'S GREAT WITH THE KIDS,
AND I GUESS WE'LL BE FRIENDS --

791
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,410
SOME DAY.

792
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,710
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

793
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,150
UH-HUH.

794
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,450
ALL RIGHT, YOUR TURN.

795
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,180
WHAT BROUGHT YOU
TO HOPE SPRINGS?

796
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:53,950
I COME FROM A LONG
\hLINE OF DOCTORS.

797
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:57,860
\h\h\hMY PARENTS EXPECTED ME TO
BECOME A DOCTOR TOO, SO I DID.

798
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,160
AND THEN THEY EXPECTED ME TO
\h\hGO TO WORK AT A HOSPITAL

799
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:03,930
WHERE THERE'S AN ENTIRE WING
\hNAMED AFTER MY GRANDFATHER,

800
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:05,230
AND THAT WASN'T GOING TO HAPPEN.

801
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,530
OH.

802
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:10,440
SO I DECIDED TO LEAVE THE CITY

803
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,470
AND GO SOMEPLACE WHERE I COULD
\h\h\hBREATHE A LITTLE EASIER,

804
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:16,510
HAVE A LIFE OF MY OWN.

805
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,810
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR KIDS.

806
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:20,850
WELL, ZACK IS 11.

807
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:23,020
HE'S INTO EVERYTHING.

808
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,050
\h\h\h\hHE WANTS TO DO
SOMETHING BIG SOME DAY.

809
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:29,960
AND SARAH IS 16.

810
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,560
AND I TEND TO FORGET SHE'S
NOT A LITTLE GIRL ANYMORE.

811
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,290
IT'S HARD.

812
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:36,460
'CAUSE I JUST WANT TO PROTECT
HER FROM THE WORLD, YOU KNOW?

813
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,630
OH, I CAN IMAGINE.

814
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,370
I LOVE KIDS.

815
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:42,100
\h\hI'M GOING TO PICK ME UP
A COUPLE OF THEM SOME DAY.

816
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,840
YEAH.

817
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,440
(laughing)

818
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,610
HMM, WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

819
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,910
NOTHING.

820
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:50,780
\h\h\hWHY DON'T YOU TAKE A
PICTURE, IT'LL LAST LONGER.

821
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,510
YEAH, RIGHT, OKAY, FINE.

822
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:52,950
HEY!

823
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,550
HEY!

824
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,020
OH, GA!

825
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,500
HEY, FRANKIE, LOOK AT THAT.

826
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:19,840
THERE.

827
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,570
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

828
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:23,740
HEY, FRANKIE --

829
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,480
HEY, YOU KNOW THAT
LOOKS LIKE OUR DOGS.

830
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,080
GEE, YOU THINK?

831
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,680
IT SAYS THESE DOGS
\h\hCAN HEAL PEOPLE.

832
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,420
MIRACLE DOGS?

833
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,290
WOW.

834
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,020
IT AIN'T FOR REAL.

835
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,760
\h\h\h\h\hIT'S PROBABLY SOME
SORT OF SCAM, YOU KNOW?

836
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,360
\hSOME PEOPLE WILL
BELIEVE ANYTHING.

837
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,530
I DON'T KNOW, I THINK IF YOU
REALLY BELIEVE IN SOMETHING,

838
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:43,260
ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE.

839
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,130
HEY, MAYBE IT'S
'CAUSE OF THOSE DOGS

840
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:46,730
THAT MY HEAD
DOESN'T ITCH ANYMORE.

841
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:48,030
\hIF THOSE DOGS COULD
ACTUALLY HEAL PEOPLE

842
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,770
THEY WOULD BE WORTH A FORTUNE.

843
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,370
YOU KNOW, IT'S TOO BAD YOU
\h\hTHREW THEM IN THE RIVER.

844
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:55,840
WELL, I KIND OF HAVE
A CONFESSION TO MAKE, FRANKIE.

845
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,710
WHAT IS IT?

846
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,010
BUT YOU HAVE TO
PROMISE NOT TO GET MAD.

847
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,610
\hYOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE
TO MAKE PROMISES, LEO.

848
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,350
I JUST --

849
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:02,780
OKAY.

850
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,520
I WON'T GET MAD.

851
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,820
TELL ME.

852
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:08,420
I DIDN'T THROW THE DOGS IN
\hTHE RIVER LIKE YOU SAID.

853
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,890
\h\h\hI LEFT THEM NICE
AND SAFE UNDER A TREE.

854
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,190
SEE, YOU'RE MAD, I KNEW IT.

855
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,490
ARE YOU KIDDING?

856
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,790
THAT'S THE BEST NEWS
I'VE HEARD ALL WEEK.

857
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,670
LET'S GO.

858
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,100
WHERE?

859
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,700
TO GET RICH.

860
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,300
\h\h\h\hZack: THERE ARE 88
CONSTELLATIONS IN THE SKY.

861
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,900
A CONSTELLATION IS
\hA GROUP OF STARS.

862
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,510
THE ANCIENT GREEKS NAMED MANY
\h\h\h\hOF THE CONSTELLATIONS

863
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:31,840
AFTER HEROES LIKE ANDROMEDA,
\h\h\h\h\hORION, AND PERSEUS.

864
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,880
A HERO IS SOMEONE WHO
\hHELPS OTHER PEOPLE,

865
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,350
EVEN IF IT'S DANGEROUS.

00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,520
I'D LIKE TO BE A HERO SOME DAY.

867
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,420
BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF
\hOPPORTUNITIES FOR KIDS.

868
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,160

869
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,760
WELL, IT'S JUST UP AHEAD.

870
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,500
IT'S JUST A LEFT

871
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:50,930
LEFT AT THE --

872
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,670
THERE'S 200 TREES HERE.

00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,970
OH, THAT LOOKS LIKE IT.

874
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,700
YEAH, THAT LOOKS LIKE IT.

875
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,300
NO, NO, THAT'S IT.

876
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,040
\hWELL, THAT KIND
OF LOOKS LIKE IT.

877
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,210
COME ON, LEO, WHICH ONE?

878
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:06,550
WELL, ALL I KNOW IS IT HAS
A "NO HUNTING" SIGN ON IT.

879
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,580
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT?

880
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,180

881
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:15,650
THEY'RE GONE.

00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,400
YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

883
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:18,260

00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,120
THIS IS PERFECT.

885
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,870
SOMEBODY STOLE OUR STOLEN DOGS.

886
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:23,030
WE WERE MEANT TO
HAVE THOSE DOGS, LEO,

887
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:24,760
JUST LIKE WE WERE
MEANT TO HAVE THAT CAR.

888
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,930

889
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:28,230
