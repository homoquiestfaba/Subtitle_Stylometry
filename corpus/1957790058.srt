1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:05,605
(birds chirping) (air whooshing)

2
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,151
(mischievous music)

3
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,104
- [Cameraman] Is yours working?

4
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:39,639
- [Cameraman] Mm hm.

5
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,475
(Dwight sighs)

6
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:46,212
(cameraman speaking faintly)

7
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:51,217
- [Kaiser] All right, we're just gonna start easy.

8
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,586
Can you give me your name, age and where you're from?

9
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,655
- Okay.

10
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:57,424
My name is Dwight Nixon.

11
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:00,493
I'm from Atlanta, Georgia.

12
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:02,862
I'm 37 years old.

13
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,364
- [Kaiser] And your wife?

14
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,132
- My wife's name is Emily Nixon.

15
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,468
She's from Springfield, Tennessee.

16
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,170
We both are livin' here now.

17
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,738
- [Kaiser] Where's your wife now?

18
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,643
- (sighs) Emily went missin' 32 days ago.

19
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:20,513
- [Kaiser] Do you know what might've happened to her?

20
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:24,784
- No, but I plan to find out.

21
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,221
- [Kaiser] Did you kill your wife?

22
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,793
(singer vocalizing)

23
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:37,797
My name is Kaiser Whitmore.

24
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,201
Me and my college classmate, Charlie Burris,

25
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:43,303
are film students in Nashville, Tennessee.

26
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:45,472
We read about the disappearance

27
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:46,906
of Emily Nixon - Emily!

28
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,441
- [Kaiser] and her husband Dwight's ongoing search

29
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:51,177
for her while also remaining the primary suspect.

30
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:53,613
We thought it interesting enough,

31
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:55,415
so we inquired about doing this interview.

32
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,817
(Emily laughing)

33
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,786
What we thought was gonna be a single day

34
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,921
of filming turned into much more than that.

35
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:04,757
Something more mysterious,

36
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,793
(shutter flashing)

37
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:08,194
more unexplainable.

38
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,496
- [Dispatcher] 911, what's your emergency?

39
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:10,497
- [Kaiser] More sinister.

40
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,865
(dramatic music)

41
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,199
- Oh my God! - Oh God!

42
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,534
Get outta here.

43
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:18,204
(somber mysterious music)

44
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:53,907
- A few days after our initial interview,

45
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,577
Dwight agreed to walk us through the day Emily disappeared.

46
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,978
It happened on an 82 acre farm

47
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,514
in Springfield, Tennessee called Howard's Mill.

48
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,485
Abandoned for nearly 50 years,

49
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,388
the land consists of mostly overgrown fields,

50
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:10,623
some small wooded areas and a large pond.

51
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:13,960
That much stuff?

52
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,295
Oh, he's here.

53
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,829
- Okay, okay. - Do you need help?

54
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,665
- [Charlie] No, I'm good, I'm good.

55
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,869
- [Kaiser] Hey, good to see you again.

56
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:23,836
- Hey, how you doin'?

57
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,604
- [Kaiser] Good, how are you?

58
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,339
- I'm all right.

59
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,507
- Well, thank you so much for coming.

60
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,477
Do you mind just walking us through that day,

61
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,881
beginning of the day up until her disappearance?

62
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,282
- Yeah, sure.

63
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:40,320
Emily and I got here probably about 12:15.

64
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,487
- Okay.

65
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:42,722
- We stopped by the nursing home.

66
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:45,024
Emily's mom is in the nursing home.

67
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,392
- Oh, okay.

68
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,494
- And we made sure she got her meds

69
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,863
and talked with her for a minute, then we drove up here.

70
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,831
Yeah.

71
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,366
- What were you guys doing over here again?

72
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,434
- Metal detector,

73
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:55,301
metal- - That's right.

74
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:55,969
- Yeah. - Okay.

75
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,606
So, when you did bring him in

76
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,075
was there anything off about him?

77
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:04,077
- Nothin' stuck out at first.

78
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,981
He had a good recollection of the day.

79
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,383
And what were you doin' on the property?

80
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,487
- My wife and I are amateur treasure hunters.

81
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,522
- Do you ever find anything?

82
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,591
- No, it's just a way of spending time together.

83
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,959
So, we're up here.

84
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,929
We're metal detecting and then we decided, okay.

85
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:25,398
We decide we're gonna split off.

86
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,399
All right?

87
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,534
So, I go- - Wait, y'all split off?

88
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:32,739
- When did you decide to go in different directions?

89
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,441
(Dwight sighs) (mysterious music)

90
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:36,943
- We didn't.

91
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,112
Well, I mean, it's what we do.

92
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:40,947
We walk in different directions

93
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,049
so we're not coverin' the same area.

94
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:47,420
- Kinda counter to spendin' time together wouldn't you say?

95
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,457
- And we always agree to meet at a certain,

96
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,659
meet at a middle point.

97
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:55,561
And so, we agreed to meet right over here, over that ridge.

98
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,630
Do you see way up there where that ridge is?

99
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:58,564
- Yeah. - Okay.

100
00:04:58,598 --> 00:04:59,966
That's where we agreed to meet.

101
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,368
- When he started walkin' us through the routes

102
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,137
that he and his wife took around the property,

103
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,439
that's when his story began fallin' apart.

104
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,341
- So, you saw her the whole time?

105
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,644
- I saw her most of the time, yeah.

106
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:15,114
- Can you show me on the map, the area you covered?

107
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,986
- And if you look over this ridge here,

108
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,821
you really can't see down into that.

109
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,823
So, I figured that maybe she'll

110
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,425
come over the hill eventually.

111
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,861
So, I stop right about here in this little open space.

112
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:32,865
- And where we found a piece of Emily's metal detector?

113
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,103
(Dwight sighs)

114
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,138
- And I feel somethin' under my foot.

115
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,975
(dramatic music) (shutter flashing)

116
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,177
- [Charlie] Did the police come here

117
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,445
and meet you here?

118
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:46,979
- Yes, yes.

119
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,115
They couldn't find anything, I couldn't find anything.

120
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:52,151
(mysterious music)

121
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,754
- [Kaiser] While searching the property,

122
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,155
police discovered Emily's phone.

123
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,757
(shutter flashing)

124
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,925
The following footage

125
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,460
was the last thing Emily recorded

126
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,528
just moments before her disappearance.

127
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,732
- I'm gettin' a strong kick here.

128
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,500
It seems to be about six inches down.

129
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,136
(dramatic music)

130
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,041
What do we have here?

131
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,076
Dwight's gonna be so mad.

132
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,779
He never really finds anything.

133
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,482
I'm not sure what it is right now

134
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:25,084
but it seems kind of heavy and metallic.

135
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,453
I'm gonna have to get it home to wash it off.

136
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:30,089
(dramatic music)

137
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,442
(children singing)

138
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,717
- [Dwight] Emily was born in Springfield, Tennessee.

139
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,684
- [Man] What are y'all posin' for?

140
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,186
This is a movie camera.

141
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:03,623
- [Dwight] Her dad died when she was six months old.

142
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,226
- They can't bring no camera with you.

143
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,696
- [Dwight] So, she was raised by her mom.

144
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,498
Just she and her mom.

145
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:15,067
(solemn music)

146
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,704
- I've known Emily since we were kids.

147
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:19,839
- We grew up together.

148
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:20,973
We had lots of classes together

149
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,275
and we just became best friends.

150
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,577
- We've been best friends since junior high.

151
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,711
She was always happy.

152
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,180
She always had a smile.

153
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,216
- She was sweet, kindhearted and hilarious.

154
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:35,087
- Beautiful personality, liked by everyone.

155
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,857
- This town has always been really fun for us.

156
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,826
We hung out, we got our own little places

157
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,727
that we love to go and we spend a ton

158
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,630
of time just runnin' around and bein' goofy girls.

159
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,069
- Emily and I met in 2011.

160
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,039
- When he got with Emily,

161
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:55,208
it's like his whole life just changed.

162
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,876
- Hi. (Dwight laughs)

163
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:57,743
- Isn't she cute?

164
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:58,678
- He loved Emily.

165
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:00,112
He'd just do anything for Emily.

166
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,816
♪ Happy birthday

167
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,186
- It felt really quick, like pretty quick for her.

168
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,654
I mean, that was a unique situation.

169
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,790
I wasn't used to her responding so quickly.

170
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:14,260
- It was fast, but he just fell head

171
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:17,597
over heels in love with her.

172
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,067
(Emily laughs)

173
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,635
(Dwight groans)

174
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,071
- We got married in 2013.

175
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:27,640
(soft music)

176
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,112
- [Emily] So, Dwight just got to Springfield, Tennessee.

177
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:33,980
(Dwight sighs)

178
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,181
(Emily giggles)

179
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,250
You ready for your first pair of overalls?

180
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:38,484
(Dwight laughs) (Emily giggles)

181
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:41,120
- What'd you think we didn't have 'em Atlanta in the 1990s?

182
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,788
(Emily laughs)

183
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,156
I just hope you don't care

184
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,192
if I have one strap on with no shirt (indistinct).

185
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,793
(Emily laughs)

186
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,562
Oo yeah! - Oh, whatever (laughs).

187
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,832
Well, I think you're gonna love living here.

188
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,767
It's a great place to raise a family.

189
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,204
- So, you're ready for a family?

190
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,072
(Emily laughs)

191
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,774
- Hm, maybe.

192
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:05,211
(somber music)

193
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,630
- Robertson County was founded in 1796

194
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:28,367
the same year the state of Tennessee was established.

195
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,969
(clock chimes)

196
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:34,106
It is a small town, but we do have a lot of history.

197
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,977
We have tobacco, we have the whiskey industry.

198
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,879
It's a wonderful place to live.

199
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,950
- Been here all my life, so far.

200
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,087
- I feel like everyone's family here.

201
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,997
- That Eagle was picking up baby pigs,

202
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,865
and so it had to be killed.

203
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,368
(somber music)

204
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,218
- [Kaiser] Did you ever regret moving here?

205
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:20,820
- No, not at all.

206
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:22,755
I don't- - Even if it means

207
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:23,823
you never see Emily again?

208
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:28,361
- No, I don't regret moving here and I definitely

209
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,764
don't blame moving here for Emily's disappearance.

210
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,201
- [Kaiser] Is it possible that Emily just left on her own?

211
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,102
- Absolutely not.

212
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,705
She wouldn't just leave.

213
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:42,208
(eerie music)

214
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,713
- There was somethin' about Emily's disappearance

215
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:49,949
that never seemed right to me.

216
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,252
The clues weren't there.

217
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,456
In my experience, when somebody goes missing,

218
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,457
there's always a clue.

219
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,859
We had nothin' to go on.

220
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,963
- [Man] She just flat disappeared.

221
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,932
- [Man] He was the last person to see her.

222
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,801
That's going to obviously put him

223
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,137
at a higher level of suspicion.

224
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:13,472
- [Kaiser] Do you think her husband

225
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,940
had something to do with it?

226
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,744
- Man, I hate to speculate on stuff like that.

227
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,314
- When this case with she'd been gone a month,

228
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,050
I would likely expect to find

229
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,851
a body instead of a living person.

230
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,021
- Course everybody's got an angle.

231
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,357
Who you gonna believe?

232
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,060
(eerie music)

233
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,001
- [Bobby] Were there any problems in your marriage problems?

234
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,502
- No, we didn't have any problems.

235
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,504
Not any different than any other couple.

236
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,406
- Any major fights recently?

237
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:49,742
- No.

238
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,145
- Why are you harassin' me?

239
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,246
- Why do you think I had lunch with you?

240
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,383
- Last chance. - You're crazy.

241
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,819
- Do you recall that argument?

242
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,054
(Dwight speaking faintly)

243
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:02,955
- Yes.

244
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:07,026
- We were able to uncover a bit more evidence

245
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,995
about the relationship between Mr and Mrs. Nixon.

246
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,397
- Sometimes people are drunk and they fight,

247
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,066
and she'd spend some time with me when she felt

248
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,402
like she needed to let him cool off.

249
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,471
- [Kaiser] He would never physically hurt her, would he?

250
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,906
- Absolutely not, absolutely not.

251
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:26,378
He was not brought up around violence at all.

252
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,013
He comes from a family where

253
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:32,885
the women were very well respected

254
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:37,523
and that's just something totally against his nature.

255
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,226
- I warned her that it could possibly

256
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,561
be on the verge of actually turning violent.

257
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,865
- Even if you get angry with them, you walk away.

258
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,566
- What's wrong? - We're just friends.

259
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,567
- Just friends? - You knew that when

260
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,435
we moved here. - Why didn't you

261
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:50,402
tell me about him?

262
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,537
- [Emily] You knew about him.

263
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,905
- I knew you dated him - You knew we

264
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:53,939
- in high school. - had been best friends.

265
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,341
- I didn't know that

266
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:58,577
you had lunch with him. - We are friends, that's it.

267
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,480
- [Kaiser] Detective Latta believes you killed your wife.

268
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,048
- Of course he does (sighs).

269
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,152
But what you should concern yourself

270
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:07,953
with is what he's not sayin'.

271
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,258
This has happened before,

272
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,959
right there on that same property.

273
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:18,998
(eerie music) (singer vocalizing)

274
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,943
- People still say things happen around here all the time.

275
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,411
You can ask anybody in the community

276
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:36,115
and they've had some story or odd occurrence out here.

277
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,519
- It's kind of a local novelty.

278
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,189
Kids talk about the place and they dare

279
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:48,194
their buddies to go over there and walk around or whatever.

280
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:52,364
- [Sam] We went there one time, we'll never go back.

281
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,502
- Our friend went in and he didn't come out for 15 minutes,

282
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,604
and when he came out, he was crying.

283
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,005
- As soon as we pulled out my truck

284
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,373
just went (imitates engine chugging),

285
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,276
started givin' out and he said he saw somethin',

286
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,511
in my headlights.

287
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:07,012
He said he saw some woman or somethin'.

288
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,247
- I'm pretty sure it's like a ghost

289
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,182
because it was moving slightly.

290
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,651
And I don't believe in no supernatural

291
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,587
but I did run, so (laughs).

292
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,526
- I look up and there's like,

293
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,363
just this silver thing just sittin' in the sky.

294
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,665
And I was like, that's kinda weird.

295
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,267
- Yeah, I've seen some lights.

296
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,135
- And all this whole area,

297
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:34,640
this whole county is known to have odd events happen.

298
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:37,276
It could definitely be the reason you have strange events

299
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:40,546
and occurrences on the Howard's property.

300
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,215
All this property was sacred hunting ground to the Indians.

301
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:47,019
So, they supposedly protected this property

302
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:50,222
by way of blessing these rocks and the graves.

303
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:54,360
So, incidentally I don't mess with graves out here

304
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,696
because I don't wanna start it again, whatever it was.

305
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,668
- This has happened before,

306
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:04,470
right there on that same property.

307
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,672
- [Kaiser] What do you mean?

308
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:07,673
Who'd this happen to?

309
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:08,874
When?

310
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:14,179
- In 1994, a little girl named Sarah Winston disappeared.

311
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,949
Just vanished right there at Howard's Mill.

312
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,659
- [Sarah's Mom] Did you feed some chips to the birds?

313
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,260
- [Sarah] Uh (giggles)-

314
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:31,697
- [Sarah's Mom] Yeah, did you see that blue heron?

315
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,368
Want another sandwich, baby?

316
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:37,569
- No, I'm cool.

317
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,771
- [Sarah's Mom] Are you saving room for cake?

318
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:39,738
- Yeah. (Sarah's mom laughs)

319
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,073
- [Roger] I am, too.

320
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,608
- Chocolate cake. - Mm, mm, mm.

321
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:43,475
I love you, baby.

322
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:44,476
- I love you too.

323
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,644
- Mwah. - You want a sandwich?

324
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,046
- [Roger] No, no thank you, I'm good.

325
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,213
- You don't want- - I'm gonna go play.

326
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:49,348
- Be careful up there. - Love you, Dad.

327
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:50,282
- [Roger] All right, love you too.

328
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,450
- You didn't like that she didn't stay.

329
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:52,384
- [Roger] I don't think I do.

330
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,652
(Sarah's parents laughing)

331
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,220
- [Sarah's Mom] Look how fast she's runnin' in those boots.

332
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,188
She's running now.

333
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,192
- [Roger] Sarah?

334
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,261
- [Sarah's Mom] Sarah, are you okay?

335
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,228
- [Roger] She's playin' around.

336
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,530
- [Sarah's Mom] I don't see her.

337
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,265
- [Roger] Well, hold on.

338
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,132
- [Sarah's Mom] Sarah?

339
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,101
- [Roger] Sarah?

340
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,235
- [Sarah's Mom] Honey,

341
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:13,339
go see what happened. - Sarah?

342
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,373
Come on now.

343
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,475
- [Sarah's Mom] Sarah?

344
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,243
- [Roger] Sarah?

345
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,278
Sarah?

346
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,479
- [Sarah's Mom] Don't see her?

347
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,114
- [Roger] Sarah!

348
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:22,781
- [Sarah's Mom] Sarah?

349
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,649
- [Roger] Sarah!

350
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:24,650
Good Lord!

351
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:25,617
Where'd she go?

352
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,552
Sarah!

353
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:27,586
- [Sarah's Mom] Sarah?

354
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,088
- [Roger] Sarah?

355
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,491
- [Sarah's Mom and Roger] Sarah?

356
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:33,726
- [Roger] Oh my God.

357
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,793
Oh my God,

358
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,661
where did she go? - Sarah?

359
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:36,528
Sarah!

360
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,063
(dramatic music)

361
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:38,764
Sarah!

362
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,201
- [Sarah's Mom and Roger] Sarah!

363
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:45,137
(crow cawing)

364
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,372
- [Kaiser] We were able to track down

365
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:49,541
the lead investigator from the Sarah Winston disappearance,

366
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,211
retired Detective, Dan Thompson.

367
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:55,280
(train rattling)

368
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,082
- [Dwight] So, you worked the Sarah Winston case?

369
00:16:57,116 --> 00:17:00,119
- Yes, I did and it was real tragic, that one.

370
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,521
- Well, what do you remember about it?

371
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,157
- Oh, I remember everything.

372
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,325
Everything.

373
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,726
She went missing practically right

374
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,530
in front of her parents, broad daylight.

375
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:12,531
- Hm.

376
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,199
- Yeah, that was a strange case.

377
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,434
There was an open field.

378
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:19,238
They were out, nobody around and next thing you know, gone.

379
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,342
Nowhere to hide, nobody anywhere around, nothin'.

380
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,243
No sounds.

381
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:25,844
Very strange.

382
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,348
- What do you think happened?

383
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,315
- I'm not sure.

384
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,317
That case was never solved,

385
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:35,387
so never found an end to it.

386
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,557
- [Kaiser] We found an address for Roger Winston

387
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,160
just outside Bowling Green, Kentucky.

388
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:50,869
All right.

389
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,571
- Ah, is that it?

390
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:53,505
- [Kaiser] Yeah, this is it.

391
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,140
- Okay. - Let's go.

392
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:03,649
- It was a Saturday.

393
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,518
We were celebratin' her 10th birthday

394
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,621
off of Old State Highway 41.

395
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:10,889
- [Dwight] The Howard place?

396
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:16,128
- We just treated it like a park.

397
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:18,564
Nobody bothered us there.

398
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,303
She liked to run around.

399
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,672
- Did you see that blue heron? (Sarah giggling)

400
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,508
- [Roger] She was the happiest kid I ever saw.

401
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:31,844
- I love you, Dad.

402
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,612
- [Dwight] And you didn't see anyone else around?

403
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,349
- Nah, it's just us.

404
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,918
(solemn music)

405
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,892
Then after (sniffs), I ran up there.

406
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:48,927
Hey, baby, come on!

407
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:49,795
Tryin' to find her and,

408
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:51,230
Sarah!

409
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,331
See if she was okay and...

410
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:53,765
Sarah!

411
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,633
- [Sarah's Mom] Sarah?

412
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,567
- Sarah?

413
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:56,502
She wasn't there.

414
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,905
Vanished (inhales sharply).

415
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:01,740
Just poof, she's gone.

416
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:07,546
Gone.

417
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:12,317
(solemn music) (singer vocalizing)

418
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,429
- Roger, to say he went to pieces is an understatement.

419
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,766
- After she went missin',

420
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:32,804
he just totally, just lost his self, lost everything.

421
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,575
- [Man] It was like all the life had been taken out of him.

422
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,011
- He started havin' to deal with that grief

423
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,914
and the way that he chose to deal with it was an addiction.

424
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:46,952
It ruined his family and you can't really reason

425
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:51,557
with somebody when they're in such a depression.

426
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,427
It hits you the way it hits you.

427
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,795
If you think about it we're all

428
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:59,698
one missing kid away from being a crazy person.

429
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,704
- Then he started chasing all these theories.

430
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,775
- He's not the person I knew back before this happened.

431
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:16,515
- How can you say goodbye when they're still out there?

432
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,251
(solemn music)

433
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:26,658
After she was gone, I went back everyday,

434
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,794
and then every Saturday,

435
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:35,667
and then once a year on the day it happened.

436
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:43,675
One year I went and it was 2004,

437
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,647
and I got there and it was already dark out.

438
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,917
It was sunset but it was dark.

439
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,519
(eerie music)

440
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:58,824
And it looked different, yeah.

441
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:06,365
Somebody put a pond in almost exactly

442
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,602
on the spot where Sarah...

443
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:14,706
Sarah!

444
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,076
(Roger sniffles)

445
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,946
There was somethin' floatin' in it.

446
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:25,984
(Roger sniffling) (solemn music)

447
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,362
I found this there that night.

448
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,798
(eerie music)

449
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,870
It was wet, but it was spotless.

450
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:53,712
Just like the day she made it.

451
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:57,115
There's no way this was laying in the dirt,

452
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,984
floatin' in that pond for 10 years.

453
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:01,687
(solemn music)

454
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,096
- [Dwight] So what do you think happened?

455
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:13,031
- I think she was tryin' to come home.

456
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,701
- [Dwight] Come home from where?

457
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,370
(eerie music)

458
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:25,143
- [Kaiser] Sarah in 1994.

459
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,813
Emily in 2017.

460
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:33,051
Two disappearances so similar, but over 20 years apart.

461
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:38,623
Are they connected or just coincidental tragedies?

462
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,525
- [Roger] That's 'cause she's not dead.

463
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,794
She's still out there.

464
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,530
You wife might be, too.

465
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:52,070
- [Kaiser] We needed a lead to connect Emily and Sarah.

466
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,673
Something real, someone.

467
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,175
(eerie music)

468
00:22:58,677 --> 00:22:59,978
The day that Emily went missing,

469
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:02,514
why didn't you immediately call the police?

470
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,150
- I don't know, I did what anyone else would.

471
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:06,952
I started yellin' for her.

472
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:08,453
I called her cell phone.

473
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:11,790
That took some time.

474
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:13,625
- [Kaiser] Three hours?

475
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:16,862
- I mean, look, it took at least 10 minutes goin' back

476
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,196
and forth to the car.

477
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,133
Then goin' through the woods was like another hour.

478
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,603
(eerie music)

479
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:25,704
I wasn't thinkin' about time.

480
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,140
(eerie music)

481
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,710
- What do we have here?

482
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,811
- [Kaiser] Can I show you something?

483
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,679
(dramatic music building)

484
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:35,881
Do you see that?

485
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,449
There's someone in the background.

486
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,222
- Why am I just seein' this?

487
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,624
- [Kaiser] Because we thought it could be you.

488
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:47,759
(dramatic music)

489
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,161
- That's not me.

490
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,262
That's Wayne.

491
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:54,966
(singer vocalizing) (soft music)

492
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,934
- [Kaiser] For the first time

493
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:57,769
since we began our documentary,

494
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,738
we had a suspect other than Dwight.

495
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:07,813
The Ritchie farm borders to Howard's property to the west,

496
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,848
giving Wayne the most direct access

497
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:12,517
to Howard's Mill than any of the other neighbors.

498
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,586
- Yeah, I know Wayne.

499
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,855
He's kinda keeps to himself.

500
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:19,724
He doesn't do much socializing or nothin'.

501
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,727
- He's just one of those guys that,

502
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,197
he's kind of like the town eccentric.

503
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:29,000
- Just kinda odd (laughs), kinda like the rest of us.

504
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,602
But anyhow.

505
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,770
- You see him sometimes with,

506
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,639
he's got a rabbit in his hand that he got on the road.

507
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:35,874
I don't know what he does with it.

508
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,075
- No (chuckles).

509
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:39,878
His job is pickin' up roadkill for the county.

510
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:41,079
Somebody gotta do it.

511
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:42,981
- I know when my kids were little,

512
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:45,917
I used to go to like the food store and the toy store,

513
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:48,186
he'd be buyin' like all this baby food.

514
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,554
- Heard a story about him awhile back,

515
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:52,257
that he, he's kinda off.

516
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,593
So his momma, he wanted the money from his momma

517
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,761
and she told him to go rob a bank.

518
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:58,129
Well, he goes up here and robs the bank

519
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,998
and he ain't gonna hurt nobody.

520
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,933
But he said, "I'm here to get some money.

521
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:03,969
My momma told me to come get some money from y'all.

522
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,036
I'm here to rob a bank."

523
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:05,904
(laughs)

524
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:08,607
(eerie music)

525
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:13,245
- I think Wayne's life was probably pretty tough at home.

526
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,680
I think his dad was pretty rough on him

527
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:18,984
and his dad was a no nonsense kinda guy,

528
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:22,120
a hard workin' man, hard drinkin' guy

529
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:24,990
and I think Wayne was scared to death of him.

530
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,358
And to be honest with you,

531
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:27,792
I probably was a little bit too.

532
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:29,327
- [Kaiser] Were you scared of Wayne at all?

533
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,328
- No, no.

534
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,897
- I don't think he's dangerous.

535
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,632
I think he's just kind of a loner.

536
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:36,868
- Most people just leave him alone, leave him be because-

537
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,770
- He'd probably run 'em off anyway.

538
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:39,671
- He probably would.

539
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,605
He was- - That's the way

540
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,307
his family's always been.

541
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,844
- There's been a lot of kids going to that house.

542
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,379
Like we would normally like ride four wheelers

543
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:50,949
down our road and stuff and we never do that anymore.

544
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:55,353
He has threatened to kill me and my neighbor.

545
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,091
- [Kaiser] What's Wayne's connection to the Howard's land?

546
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,027
- Well, he kinda takes care of it.

547
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,696
Used to be a farm several years ago

548
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,665
but it kinda died out.

549
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:08,967
Now he just does some mowin' and things like that.

550
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,969
- Well, I don't know why he's mowing that lawn

551
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:13,905
when the Howard's left decades ago.

552
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:15,106
Why would anybody do that? - I don't know but he had,

553
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,275
the Howard's ain't comin' back.

554
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:22,047
- Before he kinda tried to kidnap a girl

555
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,716
I think is the way that it turned out to be.

556
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,052
We all just kinda thought that he was strange.

557
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:30,288
- He gave this girl a ride home from school.

558
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:31,923
He didn't stop at her house.

559
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:35,093
He just kept going and she was gone for a whole hour.

560
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:37,729
(eerie music)

561
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:40,765
- [Kaiser] Is Wayne a suspect?

562
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,136
- (sighs) Wayne's slow.

563
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,339
He's always been slow.

564
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:52,010
He likes to keep to himself which upsets some people.

565
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,445
Kidnappin'?

566
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:54,346
No.

567
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:59,684
Wayne Ritchie didn't kidnap anybody.

568
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,052
- [Kaiser] But what about Terra Edwards?

569
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:03,254
(dramatic music)

570
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,924
(eerie music)

571
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,794
Although Wayne Ritchie was nearby

572
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:13,431
during the disappearance of Emily Nixon and Sarah Winston,

573
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:17,736
we wrote him off as a harmless misunderstood recluse.

574
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,904
But then we learned about Terra Edwards.

575
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:22,407
(eerie music)

576
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:27,812
- Yeah, I was 14.

577
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,181
We all thought he was harmless.

578
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,817
One day he said he'd take me home.

579
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:38,857
But he just drove right past my neighborhood.

580
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,359
- Apparently Mr. Ritchie had gone to the school

581
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:43,895
in his car and my daughter doesn't have a car to drive.

582
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:45,764
So, offered her a ride home.

583
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:49,968
They drove towards the house and when she said,

584
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,169
"This is my house,

585
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:53,304
just let me off in front of the house,"

586
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,372
he kept driving.

587
00:27:57,976 --> 00:27:58,910
- Next thing I remember,

588
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:02,080
I mean, I just started screaming, freaking out.

589
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:06,217
Next stop sign I jump outta the car, run home, tell my dad.

590
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:07,452
- I could see right away.

591
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:09,120
I knew somethin' was wrong.

592
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:11,222
I called the cops.

593
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,925
(eerie music)

594
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:21,166
- Oh, I remember Wayne Ritchie very well.

595
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,068
It was my second year as a teacher.

596
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:25,537
Wayne was not a very good student

597
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,505
and his heart wasn't in it,

598
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,475
never really got in a whole lot of trouble.

599
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:32,844
He just didn't do much while he was here.

600
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:36,247
- Obviously he has somethin' wrong.

601
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,184
- It was a little awkward because he would come.

602
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,418
He was not a student here,

603
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:44,155
but he would come up and even enter the building at times.

604
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,925
So we ran him off on a number of occasions.

605
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,394
- I didn't think taking a ride with them was a big deal,

606
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:53,965
until he had that look that, I mean, it was just blank.

607
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:55,200
There was nothing there.

608
00:28:56,835 --> 00:29:00,238
- I think it was just a big infatuation on his part

609
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:01,473
that had gotten to a point

610
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:04,576
that it was probably not healthy anymore.

611
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:07,245
- I never thought he was capable

612
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:11,416
of hurting someone until that day.

613
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:13,318
- [Stan] His intentions weren't good.

614
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,889
- Now, Wayne, he did have an uncle

615
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,991
or a cousin that was on the police force,

616
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,226
tried to make it look like it

617
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,428
was an innocent misunderstanding.

618
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:24,362
Of course, it went away

619
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:28,600
and Terra's dad was pretty upset about that.

620
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:32,103
- What I remember what the cops did was nothing.

621
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,508
- [Dwight] I mean, with Emily and Sarah Winston

622
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,309
both missin' so close to his property,

623
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:41,479
that's just too much of a coincidence.

624
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:45,016
So yeah, you're damn right,

625
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:46,417
I wanna talk to Wayne Ritchie.

626
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,220
(pensive music)

627
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:59,063
- [Kaiser] Mr. Ritchie, do you have a minute?

628
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:02,167
- No, I got nothin' to say, so.

629
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,903
- [Kaiser] Do you think Dwight Nixon killed his wife?

630
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,606
- No.

631
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,241
- [Kaiser] Who do you think did?

632
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:15,213
- Nobody killed nobody.

633
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:16,281
The land done it.

634
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,348
The land took 'em.

635
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,517
It took whatever it wants.

636
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,221
It took her away.

637
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:24,322
- [Kaiser] What about Sarah Winston?

638
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:25,223
- Yep.

639
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,992
Yep, and the Lopez's.

640
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,495
- [Kaiser] The Lopez's?

641
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:31,362
Wait, wait, wait!

642
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:32,664
Who are the Lopez's?

643
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:33,965
- I can't talk right now. - No, no, just,

644
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,533
- I gotta go. - who are the Lopez's?

645
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,635
- [Wayne] Leave me alone.

646
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,407
- Did you get that?

647
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:45,677
(eerie music)

648
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,078
Wayne's mention of the Lopez's led us

649
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:49,614
to a third missing persons case connected

650
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,583
to the Howard's property.

651
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:54,452
In 1977 a family of migrant workers vanished,

652
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:57,088
leaving behind their nine-year-old son, Daniel.

653
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,258
- [Daniel] My uncle cried out.

654
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:01,626
I looked up and he was gone.

655
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:03,995
(dramatic music)

656
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:08,199
Then my father, he fell,

657
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,668
dropped straight to the ground.

658
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,104
He was reachin' up for my mother's dress

659
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:17,208
when he was goin' down and then she was gone, too.

660
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:20,111
(dramatic music)

661
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,426
- [Kaiser] Are you familiar with the Lopez's?

662
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,095
- No, I don't believe so.

663
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:42,267
- In the '70s they started entering migrant workers

664
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,736
here to work the tobacco field 'cause they couldn't

665
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,170
get other people to work.

666
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:50,108
- The Howard's had foreign farm hands

667
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:52,043
come in before anybody else did.

668
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,045
- He used a lot of 'em, Mr. Howard.

669
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,147
He used a lot of 'em throughout the years.

670
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:00,718
- [Dwight] You remember the Lopez case?

671
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,353
- Mm hm, yeah.

672
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:06,524
They left a abandoned little boy, I think.

673
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:08,026
Left a little boy at 10 years old,

674
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,227
nine years old, somethin' like that.

675
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,297
- His family went missin' and we took them in for awhile

676
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:16,467
and we were hopin' that his family would come back

677
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:19,237
but they never did.

678
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,440
The county came and got him and sent him back to Illinois.

679
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:23,741
- It's really sad though,

680
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:27,345
that his family left him like that.

681
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:28,613
- I just had a hard time believin'

682
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:31,349
that they ever would abandon their son.

683
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:32,317
They were such a tight knit family.

684
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,519
- Do you have a case file I could look at?

685
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,721
- I don't, no.

686
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:39,424
That was Jennings case and he's passed on now.

687
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,326
So, I'm sure there's something in the archive.

688
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,160
We can go look it up.

689
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:44,362
(soft music)

690
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,775
- [Helen] I'm Helen Jennings.

691
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,078
David Jennings was my husband.

692
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:04,582
- [Kaiser] What did he do?

693
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:07,719
- He was on the police force here in Springfield.

694
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:12,223
He was on the force, gosh, for 40 years plus

695
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:16,461
and he was promoted to detective in '69, 1969, I think.

696
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:21,132
- [Kaiser] Is there a lot of detective work in this town?

697
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,533
It seems pretty quiet.

698
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,569
- Well, it does, but you'd be surprised.

699
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:28,706
We had a lot of crime here, including murders.

700
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,576
- [Kaiser] Any cases that stood out in particular?

701
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:33,277
- Oh yes, absolutely.

702
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:35,546
It was the Lopez case.

703
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,415
It just got under his skin more

704
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:40,084
than anything else he ever worked on.

705
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,820
They never found any trace of the family,

706
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,156
they left everything behind.

707
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:48,693
The boy even said, "They disappeared into the earth."

708
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:50,762
- [Kaiser] Did he believe Daniel's story

709
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:52,797
about being sucked into the earth?

710
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,432
(Helen sighs)

711
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:58,136
- He believed there was a logical explanation to it.

712
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,505
He investigated sinkholes, earthquakes,

713
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,174
anything that he could find

714
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,443
that would prove the boy's story,

715
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:10,148
but sad as it was, the Lopez family abandoned Daniel.

716
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,650
(eerie music)

717
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,554
- [Kaiser] We were able to track down Daniel Lopez,

718
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:18,790
who is now living in Raleigh, North Carolina.

719
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:24,562
- [Dwight] Daniel?

720
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:25,630
- Yes. - Hey, Dwight.

721
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:26,898
- Hey, how you doin'?

722
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:28,199
- This is Kaiser - Kaiser, nice to meet you.

723
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,400
- and Charlie. - Pleasure, pleasure.

724
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,202
How's it goin'? - You ready to talk?

725
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:31,869
- Yeah, yeah.

726
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:32,737
Come on in.

727
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:33,905
- All right.

728
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:34,906
- Come on.

729
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:37,675
(gentle music)

730
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:40,745
- [Dwight] Let's start with you tellin'

731
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:42,480
us who your parents were.

732
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:44,182
- My parents were migrants.

733
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,383
We all traveled together.

734
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,587
- So what brought you and your family to Howard's Mill?

735
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,757
- Howard's Mill was a big tobacco farm.

736
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,259
We spent many months there.

737
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:57,361
- Do you remember a man named Wayne Ritchie?

738
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:58,663
- He lived nearby.

739
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:00,498
We spent some time together.

740
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:02,200
We didn't have much in common,

741
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:06,671
but neither of us really was around other kids.

742
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:08,906
- Tell us about the, what you remember

743
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,476
about the day your family disappeared.

744
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,845
- It was late afternoon.

745
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:14,879
I was about,

746
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:19,350
20 steps from the old barn.

747
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:24,789
My family was out in the fields, loading up the pickup truck

748
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:26,157
with the day's crop.

749
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,460
- [Dwight] Can you describe that field?

750
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:32,430
- It was directly behind the house.

751
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,733
The ground dipped down

752
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:39,937
and started to spring right back up into a ridge.

753
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,674
They were about halfway up the hill,

754
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:47,912
maybe about 100 to 150 yards from the house.

755
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:49,580
My uncle cried out.

756
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:51,249
I looked up and he was gone.

757
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:53,317
(dramatic music)

758
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,319
Then my father,

759
00:35:56,587 --> 00:36:00,224
he fell, dropped straight to the ground.

760
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:01,792
He- - You remember it that well?

761
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:09,567
- Yeah, you can't forget something like that.

762
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,271
I got scared, so I ran.

763
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:16,541
Went back to the last spot where I saw my family.

764
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,978
After awhile, a police officer came and got me.

765
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:26,450
- I'm gonna show you something.

766
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,221
This video was taken in 1994.

767
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:33,925
- [Sarah] I'm gonna go play.

768
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,293
- [Roger] All right honey, love you.

769
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:36,427
Be careful up there. - Love you, Dad.

770
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,361
- [Roger] All right, love you too.

771
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:37,995
- [Sarah's Mom] You didn't like

772
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:38,963
that she didn't stay.

773
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:39,897
- [Roger] I don't think I do.

774
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,532
(Sarah's parents laughing)

775
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:42,466
- [Sarah's Mom] Look how far she's running in her boots.

776
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,434
- [Roger] Oh my goodness, honey.

777
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:44,368
- [Sarah's Mom] Birthday boots.

778
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:45,503
- She's fast. - Whoops.

779
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,506
- Yeah, yes.

780
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,376
That's exactly what happened.

781
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:56,013
(dramatic music)

782
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,915
- Her name is Sarah Winston.

783
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,750
- [Daniel] Okay.

784
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,352
- Daniel, she's still missing.

785
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,820
Nothing was ever found except

786
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:04,021
for that pink and white hair bow

787
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,524
that you can see in the recording.

788
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,360
That same hair bow was found 10 years later,

789
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,528
floating in a pond that was built

790
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,363
on the site of her disappearance.

791
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,799
(eerie music)

792
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,608
- So, Dwight is out there marking a location

793
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:26,877
where the Lopez's were working,

794
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:31,782
and we're about 20 steps from the old barn,

795
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:33,684
which would put Daniel right here.

796
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:36,287
Hey, how's it goin' out there?

797
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,057
- Well, based on Daniel's account,

798
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,560
this is the spot where the family disappeared.

799
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:45,997
The family was gathering supplies right here

800
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:49,634
where I'm standing and guy's,

801
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:51,102
looking around I don't see any obstacles

802
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:54,605
or anything that you can hop on.

803
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,074
- [Kaiser] So, how fast do you think it would take to get

804
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,543
to the tree line right behind you?

805
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:02,546
- Well, I mean, if you were running really fast,

806
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,748
maybe 20, 30 seconds.

807
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,084
- [Kaiser] So, if Daniel looked down for a second

808
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,421
they could have easily ran towards those trees.

809
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,723
- I mean, it's possible, but there are plenty

810
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:14,892
of easier ways of abandoning your kid than just waiting

811
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:17,595
for him to look down and then running to some trees.

812
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:20,131
- [Kaiser] Yeah, he's right.

813
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:22,833
(eerie music)

814
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,770
- [Dwight] Emily disappeared here.

815
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,941
- And Lopez's over there up that ridge about 100 yards.

816
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:36,080
- Yeah, and then Sarah Winston disappeared

817
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:37,782
over this region, near the pond.

818
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,118
We're talkin' three different disappearances,

819
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,887
all on the same property.

820
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,523
(eerie music)

821
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:56,367
(birds chirping)

822
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:07,478
(eerie music)

823
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:39,176
- [Kaiser] To get a better idea

824
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,946
of the geological layout of Howard's Mill,

825
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:44,615
we visited the Robertson County Archives.

826
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:51,188
(Dwight sighs)

827
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,458
- We've got all their names on the back side.

828
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,127
- Okay. - Yes.

829
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:01,165
Okay, so Howard's Mill should be there.

830
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:04,935
- [Dwight] Wow.

831
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:10,074
- So that bounds up to Highway 11 and mile marker 42.

832
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:14,812
Hm, that is really interesting.

833
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:17,481
You notice it's a triangular piece of property.

834
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:19,750
You seldom ever find triangular pieces

835
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:22,686
of property like that one anymore.

836
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,754
- Yeah, I see that.

837
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:24,789
Are there any other properties

838
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:27,124
like that here in Springfield?

839
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:27,958
- I doubt it.

840
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:30,661
(gentle music)

841
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,099
- Originally, it was Pickett's Mill.

842
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:36,700
It was named after John Pickett

843
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:37,802
who was the man who built it.

844
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:38,803
John was born in Virginia

845
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:42,606
and he and Thomas Kilgore

846
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,743
established Cross Plains, Tennessee near the Red River.

847
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:50,714
About three years after that, John and his wife, Hannah,

848
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:53,751
moved three miles to the east and built the mill.

849
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,787
In 1971, the Howard's came into town

850
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:59,256
from St. Louis and they bought

851
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,126
the mill from one Marty Lewis.

852
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:04,195
That's L-E-W-I-S Lewis.

853
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:09,233
And she was a direct descendant of the Pickett family.

854
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:11,735
- [Kaiser] Are you aware of any disappearances

855
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,771
that have happened on the property?

856
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,840
- You mean, Grant Pickett?

857
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:20,144
Grant Pickett vanished in plain sight of his family.

858
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:23,681
Story goes that he was working in his field

859
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:26,984
and his son who was climbing a tree fell out

860
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:30,020
of the tree and broke his arm and he started screaming.

861
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:34,124
So, Grant goes running toward his son and his wife, Mary,

862
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,260
who was in the house, goes running as well.

863
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:37,795
Mary is closer.

864
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,698
She gets to the boy first and as Grant Pickett

865
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:45,269
is running toward his wife and screaming child, he vanished.

866
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:47,872
Never heard from again.

867
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:49,940
- [Kaiser] Do you believe this story?

868
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:54,311
(laughs) (bright music)

869
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:58,549
- So this book should contain the current deed

870
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,719
for Ms. Rebecca Howard.

871
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,154
All right, here we go.

872
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,758
So, it is currently Rebecca Howard's property

873
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:09,293
to do with her as she places.

874
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:13,063
Now, I've heard a rumor that Ms. Rebecca wrote a will

875
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:15,366
and that it says that she's given

876
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:18,135
this land to the city at her death.

877
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:20,938
- So, the city has no jurisdiction over the land?

878
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:24,074
- That is owned by Rebecca Howard, period.

879
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:26,710
(eerie music)

880
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:40,357
(Dwight groans)

881
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:44,962
- [Dwight] You got it?

882
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:45,829
Good.

883
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:46,764
- [Kaiser] Heck yeah.

884
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:47,731
- [Dwight] All right, thank you.

885
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:56,874
- [Charlie] Got something here.

886
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:57,975
- Be careful.

887
00:42:58,008 --> 00:42:59,043
A lot of glass. - What is that?

888
00:42:59,076 --> 00:42:59,977
- Yeah.

889
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,278
- It's the Howards.

890
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,981
(eerie music)

891
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:09,820
You guys see this door?

892
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:13,057
It locks from the outside.

893
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,759
(eerie music)

894
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:21,398
We've got some kids' clothes over here.

895
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,435
- [Kaiser] I thought the Howard's didn't have any kids.

896
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:26,704
- I thought they didn't have any kids either.

897
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:29,139
(eerie music)

898
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:37,081
Again, here we are.

899
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,415
Same thing.

900
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,951
Lock is on the outside of the door.

901
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,157
- [Kaiser] Oh, God, it's a door.

902
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:49,960
(pensive music)

903
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,135
(indistinct)

904
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:03,941
(Charlie groans)

905
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,709
Gives me the creeps.

906
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:21,291
(Dwight coughing)

907
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:28,932
- [Dwight] Wait a minute, wait a minute.

908
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:29,800
I got somethin'.

909
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,001
- [Kaiser] What?

910
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:35,806
- What is this?

911
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:38,342
- [Charlie] A box?

912
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:42,946
(music box playing)

913
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,715
- [Dwight] It's like a music box.

914
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:48,352
Then I've got a box here.

915
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:51,188
(Dwight panting)

916
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,326
Wait, wait, I got somethin'.

917
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,332
Pictures. - It's pictures.

918
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,968
- [Dwight] It's a little girl (panting)

919
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:06,370
- [Kaiser] Who is she?

920
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:07,337
- [Dwight] I don't know.

921
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:10,107
(pensive music)

922
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:16,313
(singer vocalizing)

923
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:24,421
- [Kaiser] I thought the Howard's didn't have any kids?

924
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:30,527
- [Dwight] I thought they didn't have any kids either.

925
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:34,765
- I don't remember the Howard's having any kids.

926
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:42,773
- Yeah, I think they did have some kids, a boy I believe.

927
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:47,945
But again, they had a lot of farm hands over there.

928
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,514
So, it could've been one of them.

929
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:54,585
- I can remember one time my old truck broke down

930
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:56,587
out close to their farm,

931
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,022
and they were nice and kind enough

932
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:00,924
to let me use their phone

933
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,893
and I think I remember a girl

934
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,161
bein' there but I don't recall

935
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:07,064
them ever mentionin' her name or anything.

936
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,867
Like I said, that was back in the '70s.

937
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:13,237
- I know I wasn't, I wasn't able to find

938
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,405
any records that the Howard's had a baby.

939
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,907
Given this is a rural area,

940
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,242
it's pretty common that a lot of people

941
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,110
had children at home.

942
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,116
- [Kaiser] After trying to reach Rebecca Howard by Phone,

943
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,317
we decided to make the drive

944
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:28,919
to St. Louis to see her in person.

945
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,355
(eerie music)

946
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:35,492
- So, the Howard's had a kid also went missin',

947
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:37,594
or at least nobody can find him.

948
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,096
- So, what does that mean?

949
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:43,300
- I don't know what that means for Emily yet,

950
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:45,969
but between Sarah, the Lopez's and this,

951
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:49,139
it makes me wonder how big this thing can get.

952
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:56,146
(somber music) (singer vocalizing)

953
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:00,951
- After the Lopez incident,

954
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:03,654
the house didn't feel like home anymore.

955
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:06,857
It felt cold, soulless.

956
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:12,629
I started feelin' like people were watchin' me.

957
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:17,501
- There's been a recurrent theme

958
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:20,103
in a lot of the sightings in the area

959
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:23,941
from people who really have no contact with one another

960
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:28,979
and that is of these tall, slender figures who are watching.

961
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,248
They call 'em the Watchers.

962
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:34,151
People have seen them on the perimeter of their fields.

963
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:37,421
People have seen them in their barns, in the haylofts.

964
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:41,391
- They were all lined up on the horizon.

965
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,362
(eerie music)

966
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:52,636
I called Glynis a miracle.

967
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:57,608
We tried for 15 years, prayed.

968
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:02,613
I was nearly 40 when I found out I was expecting.

969
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,586
She was playin' like she always was.

970
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:13,323
I went down to tell her supper was ready.

971
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:16,393
It seemed like she was talkin' to someone

972
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:18,962
but there wasn't anyone there.

973
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:24,434
Just before I got to her, the lights went out.

974
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:30,440
But then there was this sort of different light.

975
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:34,478
(wind chime chiming) (Rebecca gasping)

976
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:35,512
I yelled for her.

977
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:44,054
They were tellin' me to leave,

978
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,959
like that land was theirs, not mind.

979
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:55,666
I thought if I did what they said,

980
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:57,334
they'd bring her back to me.

981
00:48:57,367 --> 00:49:02,306
(wind chime chiming) (soft music)

982
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,176
- [Dwight] So in 1988, a young girl was found wandering

983
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:07,744
outside the Howard's property.

984
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,379
- [Dan] Right.

985
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:11,315
- [Dwight] She was claiming that she was Glynis Howard.

986
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:12,349
Do you remember that case?

987
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:13,317
- I remember the case.

988
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:15,786
Now, it wasn't my case, but I do remember it.

989
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:18,155
It was pretty standard, really.

990
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:20,090
A missing girl.

991
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:23,360
It's a shame though, nobody came claimin' her.

992
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:26,196
(pensive music)

993
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:35,472
- No one here now was here back then

994
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:39,576
but I was able to find a little info for you.

995
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:43,080
We have anywhere from 10 to 15 kids here at a time.

996
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:47,317
Glynis was here for two months.

997
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:53,190
She came with a kind of a sad story back in 1988.

998
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:55,158
Didn't know much about herself

999
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:58,295
and our records show she didn't talk much.

1000
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:01,531
Someone found her walkin' down the road barefoot

1001
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:06,570
and nobody had reported any missing children at the time

1002
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,439
and nobody came forward to claim her

1003
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:12,309
and she did say her name was Glynis Howard.

1004
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:15,245
- We checked out the Howard's house.

1005
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:16,413
It was about a mile

1006
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:17,814
from where the girl was picked up at there,

1007
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,083
and they hadn't been there,

1008
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:22,152
I guess probably 10 years at that point.

1009
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:26,690
So, I mean, it's common enough, last name Howard, but no.

1010
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:31,194
- Oh, yeah.

1011
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:32,496
Yeah, I remember that.

1012
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:35,832
Real sad story.

1013
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:40,270
Got a call about a kid walking down the street alone,

1014
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:43,106
pulled up in my car, checked her out.

1015
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:47,144
She was in really bad shape, barefoot, unkempt hair,

1016
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:49,112
looked like she hadn't eaten in a week.

1017
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,581
- [Kaiser] Do you know if she was related

1018
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:53,183
to anybody in town?

1019
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,151
- Nothing.

1020
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:56,119
Nobody reported anybody missing.

1021
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,222
Not much more I could do beyond that.

1022
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:03,226
- The last time we heard anything about Glynis,

1023
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,430
she had been placed with a good foster family

1024
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:08,765
and they decided to give her a permanent home.

1025
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:11,535
This story had a very happy ending.

1026
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,770
(eerie music)

1027
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:15,205
- Well, I only can give

1028
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,774
you what's non-confidential information.

1029
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:21,611
She was in our care facility for a short amount of time

1030
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:22,579
and then she was placed

1031
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:25,248
with a foster family by the name of Lasseter.

1032
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:28,819
- Okay, here's what we know.

1033
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:32,889
In 1979, the Howard's left Springfield

1034
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,858
and according to everyone who remembers,

1035
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:36,660
that house remained empty ever since.

1036
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:39,830
Then in 1988 this little girl shows up claimin'

1037
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:41,231
her last name is Howard,

1038
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,766
but the Howard's didn't have any kids.

1039
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:45,368
And if they did have a daughter, she would have to be what?

1040
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:47,504
11, 12 years old by 1988.

1041
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:49,272
So, the dates just don't add up.

1042
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:52,375
I mean, if this really is the Howard's daughter.

1043
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:55,278
- I say we find her, ask her some more questions.

1044
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:57,280
- [Woman] Hi.

1045
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:01,651
- Look at mommy!

1046
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:03,520
- [Woman] Behave like a little lady.

1047
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:05,622
You are six years old.

1048
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:07,257
Stop jumping on that couch.

1049
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,459
(Glynis giggles)

1050
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:12,262
- [Kaiser] So, how was she as a child?

1051
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,498
- Oh, she was very special child.

1052
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:17,400
Yeah, smart, funny.

1053
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:18,935
You couldn't ask for a better daughter.

1054
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:23,440
Sweet, sweet as could be, but we knew right away.

1055
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:26,309
We just knew that we were meant to be a family.

1056
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:27,911
That's all I can tell you.

1057
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:28,812
1989.

1058
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,550
And that's whose birthday?

1059
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:34,417
- Mine.

1060
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:35,819
- [Ben] Yours?

1061
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:37,187
Is it your birthday?

1062
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:39,256
Huh?

1063
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:41,258
Wow.

1064
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:42,626
What have you been doing today?

1065
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:48,832
- [Dwight] If you don't mind for the camera,

1066
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:51,868
would you tell us your full first name and last name?

1067
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:54,271
- It's Glynis Williams.

1068
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:57,741
Williams is my married name, I got married last summer.

1069
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:00,443
- [Dwight] So, tell us a little bit

1070
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:01,745
about your life growin' up.

1071
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:06,516
- Well, I'm happy to tell you

1072
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:08,919
the story I told everybody else back then

1073
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:12,656
but I was little was little,

1074
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:13,723
I was really little, though.

1075
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:16,726
So, I think memories can change.

1076
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:18,995
But,

1077
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:26,703
I was playing inside.

1078
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:29,906
I mostly only played inside,

1079
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,610
and somehow I ran out.

1080
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:35,345
I don't know if I was chasing something or...

1081
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:38,748
It's not really clear but I got all turned around

1082
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:40,884
and I couldn't find my way back.

1083
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:44,421
Now it kind of feels like a dream,

1084
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:47,757
like pieces don't really fit,

1085
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:50,894
but you swear it was real.

1086
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:52,362
Swear it really happened.

1087
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:54,397
And,

1088
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,935
yeah, I must've walked for,

1089
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:01,638
I walked for a really long time

1090
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:03,640
and then I think someone drove by

1091
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:05,408
and they called the police.

1092
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:08,078
- [Dwight] Glynis, do you remember why

1093
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:09,045
you said your last name was Howard?

1094
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,481
- I thought it was.

1095
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:12,382
I thought it was.

1096
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:15,585
Even now when I hear it,

1097
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:18,822
it still sounds like my name.

1098
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:20,924
- [Dwight] Feels natural?

1099
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:21,825
- Yeah.

1100
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,829
- [Dwight] Do you remember your parents?

1101
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:28,665
(Glynis chuckles)

1102
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:29,599
- No, not really.

1103
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:32,669
I (sighs) remember my dad.

1104
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:34,304
I remember my dad a little bit.

1105
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:41,044
And people told me about the real Howard family,

1106
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:46,850
started to talk to me about it and told me

1107
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:49,452
that there was no way I could be their kid.

1108
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:50,687
That even if they had a kid,

1109
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,422
it was impossible I could even be theirs

1110
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,791
because of my age and the time they lived in the house,

1111
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:56,393
timelines and stuff.

1112
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:57,761
And it just, nothing that would make sense to me,

1113
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:58,995
a little kid.

1114
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:03,900
A big, big part of me always felt like I was Glynis Howard.

1115
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:08,805
And so, when I was 16 I actually looked up

1116
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:10,840
the real Howard family, called 'em up.

1117
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:13,076
And I thought if we could see each other

1118
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:14,711
it would clear everything up.

1119
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:16,413
You know? - Yeah.

1120
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:20,550
- People would believe me, but I was wrong.

1121
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:22,886
I had never seen them before.

1122
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:25,689
(Glynis speaking indistinctly)

1123
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:27,824
I've pretty much given up on that dream.

1124
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:34,597
I used to have this fantasy that my real parents,

1125
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:38,968
my birth parents would come back for me.

1126
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:41,171
(Glynis laughs)

1127
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:43,039
Like they didn't abandon me.

1128
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:45,675
They just, lost in an accident or somethin'.

1129
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:50,180
(Glynis sniffles)

1130
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:51,881
I used to have a lot of fantasies back then,

1131
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:58,755
that I was a princess or a time traveler.

1132
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:01,091
(Dwight chuckles)

1133
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:01,958
Yeah, to makes sense - Right there.

1134
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:03,693
- [Glynis] of all the...

1135
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:04,761
- Craziness? - Very, very pretty.

1136
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:05,995
- Yeah, make sense - Okay.

1137
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,630
- of all the missing pieces. - Too close.

1138
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:09,799
- [Glynis] I would just...

1139
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:13,970
I always wanted to be somethin' special.

1140
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:15,138
- [Dwight] Speakin' of missing pieces,

1141
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:17,173
I've got somethin' that I wanna show you.

1142
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:22,178
Do you- - I know this.

1143
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,146
- You recognize that box? - Yeah.

1144
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:24,047
I...

1145
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:28,518
- [Dwight] We found that in the Howard's house.

1146
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,453
It was buried with some other things.

1147
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:35,191
Yeah, I...

1148
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,427
This was, I remember this.

1149
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:41,531
I think you wind it on the bottom here.

1150
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:42,832
(music box playing)

1151
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:43,733
Yeah.

1152
00:56:45,702 --> 00:56:50,707
Oh my gosh. (music box playing)

1153
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:00,216
(sniffles) That's crazy.

1154
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,117
I...

1155
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:04,120
Yeah, this was...

1156
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:08,892
(sniffles)

1157
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:10,627
(dramatic music)

1158
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:11,861
This was mine (sniffles).

1159
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:16,666
(pensive music)

1160
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:20,703
- [Charlie] Why would they bury all of her things here?

1161
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:25,041
- I don't know.

1162
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:26,209
What do you think?

1163
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:27,710
- [Dwight] I don't know.

1164
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:30,480
(pensive music)

1165
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:36,219
- [Kaiser] Is she really a lost child of the Howard's?

1166
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:38,721
As intriguing as that theory sounds,

1167
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:41,925
we needed to focus on the more plausible explanations.

1168
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,827
- [Woman] Have fun on your big day.

1169
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:45,595
Happy birthday.

1170
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:46,996
- [Girl] Who, me?

1171
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:49,666
- [Kaiser] During our investigation,

1172
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:51,768
Dwight was called back in for questioning,

1173
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:54,804
as more evidence of his possible involvement was discovered.

1174
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:57,640
- Do you know this man?

1175
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:01,711
- I don't believe so.

1176
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:03,046
- [Detective] Edward Baker.

1177
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:05,882
- Yeah, yeah.

1178
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:08,284
Sure, I'm sorry, yeah.

1179
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,887
- Were you aware that your wife knew him?

1180
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:13,990
- Yeah, they would hustle together.

1181
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:16,726
(gentle music)

1182
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:17,994
- [Kaiser] Edward Baker was born

1183
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:20,163
and raised in Springfield, Tennessee,

1184
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:22,265
and was a close childhood friend of Emily

1185
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:23,933
and their friendship turned into something more

1186
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:25,969
when they dated throughout high school.

1187
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:29,973
- They were sweet together.

1188
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:32,175
I thought they were the perfect pair.

1189
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:33,910
- They seemed pretty cute.

1190
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:38,181
Very flirtatious around each other, high school sweetheart.

1191
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:40,817
- Eddie was two years ahead of us.

1192
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,552
Yeah, they were always together.

1193
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:49,926
- When she went off to college, they broke up unfortunately.

1194
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:52,195
- [Ashley] They tried the long distance relationship,

1195
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:53,663
but it just didn't work out.

1196
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:54,864
- [Kaiser] So, when she came back here,

1197
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:56,833
they started hanging out again?

1198
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:58,334
- Yeah, I mean, he worked a few blocks away

1199
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:01,337
in this office building over here down on Eighth

1200
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:05,174
and he'd come by for lunch or just to visit.

1201
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:09,212
- When Emily moved back to take care of her mom,

1202
00:59:09,245 --> 00:59:12,382
of course Edward came around and we hung out with everybody.

1203
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:14,384
So, it wasn't unusual for him to be around.

1204
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:16,085
- They still hang out time to time.

1205
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:17,687
I'm not sure if Dwight knows about it,

1206
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,689
but I mean, it's just a friendship.

1207
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:20,790
Everybody knows that.

1208
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:22,825
- Thank you for moving here.

1209
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:23,793
- [Dwight] You're welcome.

1210
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:25,328
- [Heather] Dwight's not really a fan of Eddie.

1211
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:27,830
I mean, can you blame him?

1212
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:30,300
- Dwight just like, really did not like

1213
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:32,735
that Edward was comin' around

1214
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:34,404
and I think he kind of let that be known.

1215
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:37,040
- [Dwight] I think when you start makin' that family-

1216
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,408
- You wanna start right now?

1217
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:39,809
- [Dwight] Oh, we can just pull over right now.

1218
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:41,878
- No, no, no, no, no, no (laughs).

1219
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:43,980
Let's at least get home first (laughs).

1220
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:47,283
(Dwight laughs)

1221
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:51,888
- Were you aware of Edward and your wife's history?

1222
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,390
- Yeah, they dated in high school.

1223
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,893
- Did you know that they were havin' an affair?

1224
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:02,298
- What makes you say that?

1225
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:05,735
- Mr. Baker came forward yesterday.

1226
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:08,838
He was a little worried, feelin' guilty.

1227
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:10,073
Thought that this information

1228
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:12,075
might help our investigation a little bit.

1229
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:15,445
- Why were you havin' lunch with your ex-boyfriend?

1230
01:00:15,478 --> 01:00:16,846
Emily, what the hell

1231
01:00:16,879 --> 01:00:17,981
is wrong with y'all? - We're just friends!

1232
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:19,148
- Just friends, right. - You knew that

1233
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:20,183
- Then why didn't - when you moved here.

1234
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:21,150
- you tell me about him? - You knew.

1235
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:23,920
- Mr. Nixon, I don't have a body

1236
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,189
and I don't have a murder weapon

1237
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:30,326
but what I do have is a motive.

1238
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:33,429
- We're through.

1239
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:36,032
♪ Remember the free

1240
01:00:36,065 --> 01:00:41,070
♪ Remember to hold your head high ♪

1241
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:45,975
♪ Remember to smile some

1242
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:50,980
♪ And just listen awhile

1243
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:55,151

We need to keep our focus on Wayne Ritchie.

1262
01:01:56,412 --> 01:01:58,981
Wayne practically grew up on the land,

1263
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:00,550
and his house is nearby.

1264
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:03,419
I've been lookin' at the city history,

1265
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,122
old maps and things like that.

1266
01:02:07,256 --> 01:02:10,426
So, what I'm wonderin' is if this entrance

1267
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:13,830
or this cave actually right here near Wayne's house

1268
01:02:13,863 --> 01:02:16,799
runs towards the Howard's land, or maybe even underneath.

1269
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,469
We need to check this out and see

1270
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:22,271
if we can find any tunnels or anything like that

1271
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:25,541
that maybe some of these people could have just fallen into.

1272
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:28,177
(eerie music)

1273
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:31,547
- We headed out to find the cave,

1274
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:34,417
and see if it could answer some of our questions.

1275
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:37,053
Not knowing the exact location of the cave,

1276
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:40,156
we decided to split up to cover more ground.

1277
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:42,558
Charlie and I headed directly east,

1278
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,360
while Dwight headed northeast.

1279
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:48,064
Here you go.

1280
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:50,800
(eerie music)

1281
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:55,304
Dwight, do you copy?

1282
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:01,177
- [Dwight] Yes, go ahead.

1283
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,178
- Just testing the range.

1284
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:03,212
Do you see anything?

1285
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:08,518
- [Dwight] No, nothing yet.

1286
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:09,418
You guys?

1287
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:13,322
- Just woods.

1288
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:16,058
(eerie music)

1289
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:30,106
Charlie, come here!

1290
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:31,207
I found it!

1291
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,074
- [Charlie] Seriously?

1292
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:32,942
- Yes!

1293
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:33,910
It's gotta be it.

1294
01:03:33,943 --> 01:03:34,544
It's the only cave we've seen.

1295
01:03:34,577 --> 01:03:35,478
Come on, come on.

1296
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:36,512
Dwight, do you copy?

1297
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:40,116
Dwight?

1298
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,219
- [Charlie] He's probably out of range.

1299
01:03:43,252 --> 01:03:47,256
- [Kaiser] It probably goes down 20 feet, it's narrow.

1300
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:50,092
- [Charlie] Okay, I don't wanna risk the camera.

1301
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:51,661
I guess I'll shoot on my phone.

1302
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:53,029
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,

1303
01:03:53,062 --> 01:03:53,930
let's do that. - Okay, let's go.

1304
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:55,198
- [Kaiser] Okay.

1305
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:56,199
Charlie, how you doin'?

1306
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:58,267
- [Charlie] I'm doin' okay.

1307
01:03:58,301 --> 01:03:59,235
How'd you get down - All right, be careful.

1308
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:00,436
- [Charlie] there so fast?

1309
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:03,239
- [Kaiser] (chuckles) That's a good question.

1310
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:05,975
(eerie music)

1311
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:10,646
- [Charlie] Do you wanna try Dwight again?

1312
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,148
- [Kaiser] Yeah, good idea.

1313
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:16,052
Dwight, do you copy?

1314
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:18,654
Dwight?

1315
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,389
We're in the cave right now.

1316
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:23,092
Just wanna let you know if you can hear us.

1317
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:24,493
- Oo! - Feel like our range

1318
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:25,394
is still bad.

1319
01:04:26,662 --> 01:04:27,563
You good?

1320
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:29,265
- [Charlie] Yeah, I'm good.

1321
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:30,333
All right. - Look at this thing,

1322
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,668
it's like an altar or something.

1323
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:36,439
- [Charlie] It's crazy!

1324
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:37,640
Look how steep it is.

1325
01:04:37,673 --> 01:04:42,178
I just wonder how far or where we are

1326
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:44,480
in relation to the Howard's property.

1327
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:49,518
Kaiser?

1328
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:50,686
Kaiser?

1329
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,188
- [Kaiser] Hey, hey, I'm right here.

1330
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:54,957
- [Charlie] Okay.

1331
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:56,325
- [Kaiser] I went down this way and it dead ended.

1332
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:58,027
Did you find anything?

1333
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,162
I found this weird little entrance thing

1334
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:02,298
over here and I don't know.

1335
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:07,336
I just, I feel like it might be a cave in.

1336
01:05:08,137 --> 01:05:09,238
- [Charlie] A cave in?

1337
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:11,374
- [Kaiser] Yeah, I mean the walls are wet.

1338
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:15,711
- [Charlie] Wet?

1339
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,313
- Yeah.

1340
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:20,149
But the only thing is it's blocked off up ahead.

1341
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:22,451
I don't think we can go any further.

1342
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:26,289
- All right, you guys okay?

1343
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:27,390
- [Kaiser] Yeah, we're good.

1344
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:28,224
You okay? - Yeah, I'm good.

1345
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:30,026
Did you find anything?

1346
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:31,627
- Well, we didn't make it too far in

1347
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:33,195
before we hit a blocked part

1348
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:36,065
but it looks like it might be a cave-in, though.

1349
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:38,701
The rocks are wet, water ran down the walls.

1350
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:41,370
- So maybe the cave was under the pond?

1351
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:44,106
(eerie music)

1352
01:05:45,374 --> 01:05:48,577
After exploring the cave, I think at one time

1353
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:51,247
the cave extended past the area, which is now a pond.

1354
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,415
Take a look at this.

1355
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:56,085
Here's the cave and here's where Sarah Winston disappeared,

1356
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:59,121
in the same spot where the pond was built six years later.

1357
01:05:59,155 --> 01:06:01,557
Emily's metal detector ring where we found it,

1358
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:03,526
this is where the Lopez's disappeared.

1359
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:05,094
The Howard's house.

1360
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:06,796
It's all one line.

1361
01:06:06,829 --> 01:06:09,198
So, if the cave does run underneath all these spots,

1362
01:06:09,231 --> 01:06:10,333
this could all be connected.

1363
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:13,469
(eerie music)

1364
01:06:13,502 --> 01:06:16,672
- There are caves everywhere in Robertson County

1365
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:20,343
and we are told that they are all connected.

1366
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:23,279
And at Cross Plains you have Kilgore Cave

1367
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:26,449
where Thomas Kilgore, the first white person

1368
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:28,250
in Robertson County spent

1369
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:31,187
the winter hiding from the Indians.

1370
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:34,223
Our historical society had our annual picnic there

1371
01:06:34,256 --> 01:06:36,392
about two weeks ago.

1372
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:37,693
- [Dwight] If we could get a better understanding

1373
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:39,528
of what's below the property,

1374
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:42,398
it could help us get answers about the disappearances.

1375
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:44,767
- The Vietcong had networks

1376
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,636
of tunnels that they used during the Vietnam War.

1377
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:51,140
They could come up through one of these openings,

1378
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:53,142
they could snatch someone out of the platoon

1379
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:56,412
down into the tunnel, seal up the hatch,

1380
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:58,247
and nobody would know what's going on.

1381
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,149
They'd be like, "Where's Joe?"

1382
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:01,817
Well, Joe's down in the bowels

1383
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:03,319
of the earth somewhere.

1384
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:06,055
(eerie music)

1385
01:07:09,825 --> 01:07:10,993
- Right now they're gonna be runnin'

1386
01:07:11,026 --> 01:07:13,763
some ground penetrating radar over the top of the site.

1387
01:07:13,796 --> 01:07:15,831
They'll lay out a grid pattern first and literally,

1388
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:17,233
it'll map out every inch,

1389
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:19,702
it'll penetrate just like a water saw does.

1390
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:21,570
So if we had any ground that's been disturbed recently

1391
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:24,340
or any type of cave system underneath us,

1392
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:25,641
it'll pick that up as well.

1393
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:27,643
Once they identify a cave or a cavern,

1394
01:07:27,676 --> 01:07:30,546
we'll be able to identify whether it does connect

1395
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:33,449
to any other systems on the property, includin' the pond.

1396
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:36,719
- [Man] One, two, three.

1397
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:39,088
There you go.

1398
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:46,629
- We're looking at the site scanning sonar,

1399
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:48,831
which is directly underneath the boat,

1400
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:51,434
penetrates all the way down to the bottom of the lake.

1401
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:52,802
- Okay, so if there's a body,

1402
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:55,571
it should appear like a white blob or a white-

1403
01:07:55,604 --> 01:07:56,739
- Yes, on either screen here,

1404
01:07:56,772 --> 01:07:58,874
it'll come up either white or kinda grayish.

1405
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:00,543
It'll pick up anything that might've fallen

1406
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:02,244
into the lake accidentally and maybe drowned,

1407
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:03,612
such as an animal.

1408
01:08:03,646 --> 01:08:05,448
So, we don't wanna put a diver down on somethin'

1409
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:06,682
that's not truly human remains.

1410
01:08:06,715 --> 01:08:07,817
As you come up here if you look at that

1411
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:09,652
where the boat is right now,

1412
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:11,253
directly underneath there,

1413
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:14,523
you can see a black kind of indentation to the red U,

1414
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:17,526
and that's an indication that there is an opening there.

1415
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:20,362
- By opening deep, do you mean like a cave or-

1416
01:08:20,396 --> 01:08:21,530
- It can be a cave or it could be

1417
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:22,565
just a really big depression

1418
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:23,699
in the bottom of the lake

1419
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:25,801
but that would appear to be a cave.

1420
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:27,236
It's goin' that northerly direction,

1421
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:30,306
almost directly where the boat is right now.

1422
01:08:30,339 --> 01:08:31,774
- So, in the same direction as the house?

1423
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:33,175
- Same direction as the house.

1424
01:08:33,209 --> 01:08:36,245
(dramatic music)

1425
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:37,480
- [Kaiser] Have you guys ever found a shaft

1426
01:08:37,513 --> 01:08:39,248
that connects to a whole cave system?

1427
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:40,483
- Absolutely.

1428
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:41,784
And that's most of the time what you do find.

1429
01:08:41,817 --> 01:08:43,886
You'll find a smaller opening that'll lead

1430
01:08:43,919 --> 01:08:46,555
into a bigger cavern or a bigger opening.

1431
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:48,457
Diving in the shaft is extremely dangerous

1432
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:50,726
'cause only one diver can go one at a time.

1433
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:52,561
So, we're gonna take every precaution we can

1434
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:53,963
to make sure the divers stay safe.

1435
01:08:53,996 --> 01:08:56,765
- [Kaiser] Which one of you are going down the shaft?

1436
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,367
- T-Roy.

1437
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,236
- [Kaiser] So, you've done this a few times?

1438
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:01,403
- Yes.

1439
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:02,571
- [Kaiser] What's it like down there?

1440
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:04,306
- It's tight.

1441
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:09,979
- So, what we're seein' down

1442
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:12,214
there right now is low visibility.

1443
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:14,817
- See by the (indistinct).

1444
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:17,186
- [T-Roy] Located the shaft.

1445
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:18,954
- [Mike] Top side, copy.

1446
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:20,322
Located the shaft.

1447
01:09:20,356 --> 01:09:22,424
- [T-Roy] Proceeding down the shaft.

1448
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:25,861
The walls are rock solid.

1449
01:09:27,963 --> 01:09:28,964
- Top side, copy.

1450
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:31,300
Rock walled, entering the shaft.

1451
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:32,935
Real good sign that we're in rock walls,

1452
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:34,970
so this potentially could be a cave system.

1453
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,472
The shaft should connect us down to the bottom.

1454
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:38,641
This is not the bottom of the lake.

1455
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:40,876
He's about 10 feet down now.

1456
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:46,715
- [T-Roy] I've reached the front of the shaft.

1457
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:47,583
Feeling the wall.

1458
01:09:47,616 --> 01:09:49,318
Hang on a sec.

1459
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:51,820
Solid, looks like a (indistinct).

1460
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:52,821
Solid (indistinct).

1461
01:09:55,724 --> 01:09:58,294
Top side, we have remains.

1462
01:09:58,327 --> 01:09:59,428
- What'd he just say? - Top side, copy.

1463
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:00,429
We have remains.

1464
01:10:00,462 --> 01:10:01,630
They have remains.

1465
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:02,998
See the girl on the GoPro? (T-Roy speaking indistinctly)

1466
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,600
And you have it here on the sonar.

1467
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:05,768
You see the difference in that white-ish gray

1468
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:07,336
we were talkin' about earlier.

1469
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:08,737
You can start to see the remains right there.

1470
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:10,706
- We don't know what kind of remains though, right?

1471
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:12,741
- We don't know until he can physically

1472
01:10:12,775 --> 01:10:14,810
and visually get up on top of it.

1473
01:10:17,646 --> 01:10:19,882
- [T-Roy] These are human remains.

1474
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:20,883
Definitely remains.

1475
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:22,284
Float the buoy.

1476
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:24,386
- Top side, copy.

1477
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:25,921
Human remains, floatin' the buoy.

1478
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:28,490
(Dwight exhales)

1479
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:33,529
(pensive music) (water gurgling)

1480
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:36,365
- [Susanna] This is Susanna Connor reporting

1481
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:38,567
for Channel 2 News from an abandoned piece

1482
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:40,603
of farmland outside of Springfield,

1483
01:10:40,636 --> 01:10:44,573
where skeletal remains of a young girl have been found.

1484
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:46,976
(eerie music)

1485
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:23,345
(phone ringing)

1486
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:26,882
- Yeah.

1487
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:30,552
Okay, yeah, no, no, I appreciate it.

1488
01:11:30,586 --> 01:11:31,820
The results are in.

1489
01:11:31,854 --> 01:11:33,922
The body was identified as Sarah Winston.

1490
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:36,525
(dramatic music)

1491
01:11:36,558 --> 01:11:38,961
(singer vocalizing)

1492
01:11:38,994 --> 01:11:40,996
- [Roger] I knew she was still out there.

1493
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:45,000
- [Kaiser] Wait, how did Sarah end up in the pond?

1494
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:46,368
It wasn't there in 1994.

1495
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:50,472
(singer vocalizing)

1496
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:01,483
- So, if the Howard's left Springfield in 1979,

1497
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:03,118
and hadn't returned, then who built

1498
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:04,720
that pond on that property?

1499
01:12:04,753 --> 01:12:07,690
- That big sinkhole opened up over there.

1500
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:09,091
It was in '98.

1501
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:10,859
It just boom, like that.

1502
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:12,928
- And that hole was massive.

1503
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:14,530
I went over there several times

1504
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:16,632
to just stand there and look down into the thing.

1505
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:17,599
It was huge.

1506
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:19,101
- With the Howard's gone,

1507
01:12:19,134 --> 01:12:20,836
nobody went up there to put any sign

1508
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:23,038
to warn people about it.

1509
01:12:23,072 --> 01:12:24,640
- A farmer's cow wandered off

1510
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:29,011
and ended up in that sinkhole, fell right in.

1511
01:12:29,044 --> 01:12:30,412
- We did get her out, though.

1512
01:12:30,446 --> 01:12:32,815
She was kinda shaken up but she's okay.

1513
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:35,818
- Yes, Sir, because of safety purposes,

1514
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:39,188
we agreed to fill the pond in with water.

1515
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:41,156
Well, they went in and filled it with rock

1516
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:44,727
and hard clay and stuff just to try

1517
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:47,629
to build a base in it where it would retain the water.

1518
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:49,031
- [Kaiser] Who filled up that sinkhole?

1519
01:12:49,064 --> 01:12:50,566
- Wayne Ritchie.

1520
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:52,768
- That pond was built by Wayne Ritchie.

1521
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:54,002
- Wayne Ritchie.

1522
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:57,005
- Well, I loaned him the equipment to do it with

1523
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,041
in exchange for fishin' rights of course.

1524
01:13:00,809 --> 01:13:05,814
- My first thought was that he drowned her somewhere else,

1525
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:08,784
kept her body and then moved her back

1526
01:13:08,817 --> 01:13:11,186
to the pond once he built it.

1527
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,621
- [Kaiser] Could Sarah's body have been moved

1528
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:14,790
to the pond after she was murdered?

1529
01:13:14,823 --> 01:13:15,924
We would need to talk

1530
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:17,760
to the forensic pathologist to find out.

1531
01:13:17,793 --> 01:13:20,195
- After we determined that the cause

1532
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:23,232
or manner of death was not from gunshot or a stab wound,

1533
01:13:23,265 --> 01:13:26,668
we then turned our investigation towards drowning

1534
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:29,805
since the skeleton was found in the pond.

1535
01:13:29,838 --> 01:13:34,843
We were gonna look at the presence or absence of diatoms.

1536
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:37,479
- [Kaiser] Diatoms are photosynthesizing algae

1537
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:40,115
that are present in every aquatic environment.

1538
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:42,117
- When we studied the bone marrow,

1539
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:45,053
we noticed diatoms present,

1540
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:48,624
indicating that the cause of death was drowning.

1541
01:13:48,657 --> 01:13:50,559
- [Kaiser] Every body of water has its own unique

1542
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:53,228
and distinct form of diatom,

1543
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:54,730
kind of like a fingerprint.

1544
01:13:56,031 --> 01:13:59,101
- We took a sample in the pond at Howard's Mill

1545
01:13:59,134 --> 01:14:03,238
and studied the signature of the diatoms present.

1546
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:07,943
Interestingly, it was an exact match to the diatoms present

1547
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:10,045
in the bone marrow of Sarah Winston.

1548
01:14:10,078 --> 01:14:11,847
- [Kaiser] The presence of diatoms in the lungs

1549
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,849
and bone marrow would indicate

1550
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:17,252
that the person entered the water alive and then drowned.

1551
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:20,055
The absence of diatoms would prove a body had been dumped

1552
01:14:20,088 --> 01:14:22,224
in the water after they were deceased.

1553
01:14:22,257 --> 01:14:24,259
- Based on these findings, the science shows

1554
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:27,930
that Sarah Winston actually drowned in 2004.

1555
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:30,632
(eerie music)

1556
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,970
- So in 1994, 10-year-old Sarah Winston disappears.

1557
01:14:35,003 --> 01:14:37,840
In 2017 the body of Sarah Winston is found

1558
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:39,741
in the pond on Howard's Mill,

1559
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:44,279
but the forensics report shows she drowned in 2004.

1560
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:46,748
So, that means she should have been 20 years old

1561
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:49,084
in 2004 when she drowned,

1562
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:50,886
but she was still at 10 years old,

1563
01:14:50,919 --> 01:14:54,523
the same age she was in 1994 before the pond was ever built.

1564
01:14:56,124 --> 01:14:57,626
Are you confused yet?

1565
01:14:57,659 --> 01:14:59,928
(eerie music)

1566
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:02,931
- Human time travel may not be probable

1567
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:07,102
but it is potentially possible.

1568
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:13,275
Technically, we are all time travelers.

1569
01:15:14,977 --> 01:15:18,046
In the past 24 hours, I traveled one day in time.

1570
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,915
I presume that you did too.

1571
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:22,751
The real question is whether

1572
01:15:22,784 --> 01:15:26,755
or not different people travel faster than others.

1573
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:28,357
Einstein thought so.

1574
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:30,659
In the case of Sarah Winston,

1575
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:35,697
you have forensic proof that a 10-year-old girl disappeared

1576
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:40,235
and then drowned at the same age 10 years later.

1577
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:43,805
The Glynis Howard story doesn't

1578
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:45,207
have the science to back it up,

1579
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:48,844
but the coincidence of them both happening

1580
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:51,914
on the same piece of bland is compelling.

1581
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:53,315
- [Kaiser] Are you saying you believe

1582
01:15:53,348 --> 01:15:56,151
that Sarah Winston traveled 10 years into the future,

1583
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:59,054
returning to this exact same spot she disappeared

1584
01:15:59,087 --> 01:16:02,190
where a pond had been built and then drowned?

1585
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:03,358
- You have two related cases

1586
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:05,794
of people with age discrepancies

1587
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:07,329
connected to the same location,

1588
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:09,031
and one of them is still living.

1589
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:14,836
I would ask the one that's still living.

1590
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:17,272
(eerie music)

1591
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:30,185
(door creaking)

1592
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:36,658
- Yeah.

1593
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:40,796
It's all familiar.

1594
01:16:42,297 --> 01:16:44,967
(eerie music)

1595
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:53,041
- Your old room.

1596
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:55,677
- No.

1597
01:16:57,179 --> 01:17:00,315
No, I've never been in this room before.

1598
01:17:00,349 --> 01:17:03,251
- [Dwight] But this is the only child's room in the house.

1599
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:10,993
- I don't remember this room.

1600
01:17:12,894 --> 01:17:15,731
When I, I remember I took naps though,

1601
01:17:15,764 --> 01:17:17,299
upstairs in this room.

1602
01:17:17,332 --> 01:17:20,002
(eerie music)

1603
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:28,944
Yeah, I took naps in here with my dad,

1604
01:17:30,078 --> 01:17:34,082
but I had my own room, was in the basement.

1605
01:17:36,218 --> 01:17:38,086
So.

1606
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:39,054
- The basement?

1607
01:17:39,087 --> 01:17:39,955
- Uh huh.

1608
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:46,395
I mean, this place is so...

1609
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:48,997
I mean, I know I was here.

1610
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:50,098
I know I was here.

1611
01:17:53,769 --> 01:17:56,238
It's crazy, I felt like it was bigger.

1612
01:18:00,976 --> 01:18:04,813
It was like twice this size when I was here.

1613
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:07,849
Like this wall wasn't here

1614
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:11,820
'cause I had like a dresser and-

1615
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:13,321
- Shine the light on here.

1616
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:14,222
Let me see.

1617
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,492
Yeah, this board is...

1618
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:19,294
Hold that light right there. - Okay.

1619
01:18:19,327 --> 01:18:20,162
- [Glynis] Be careful.

1620
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:22,764
(eerie music)

1621
01:18:28,003 --> 01:18:29,771
Got it? - Yeah, I got it.

1622
01:18:29,805 --> 01:18:30,972
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1623
01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:32,274
- Oh my God!

1624
01:18:32,307 --> 01:18:33,241
- Yeah, there's something - Yeah, yeah,

1625
01:18:33,275 --> 01:18:34,176
- in there. - yeah.

1626
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:35,477
I knew this wall wasn't here.

1627
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:37,079
I knew this wall wasn't here.

1628
01:18:37,112 --> 01:18:39,514
(eerie music)

1629
01:18:42,117 --> 01:18:42,951
- [Dwight] All right?

1630
01:18:42,984 --> 01:18:44,419
- [Charlie] Camera.

1631
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:47,089
Got it.

1632
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:52,294
- Oh my God.

1633
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:53,528
- [Dwight] What are you seein', guys?

1634
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:55,430
- [Glynis] Oh my God, this is all my stuff.

1635
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:56,565
These are my...

1636
01:18:56,598 --> 01:18:58,100
I remember these books.

1637
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:01,837
It was up against this wall but...

1638
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:03,038
And this picture.

1639
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:07,142
I mean, I looked at this picture every single day.

1640
01:19:07,175 --> 01:19:08,376
- [Dwight] Wow.

1641
01:19:09,978 --> 01:19:10,812
It's still here.

1642
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:11,780
- Yeah, I...

1643
01:19:14,182 --> 01:19:15,050
Like...

1644
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:17,586
I'm kinda in shock right now.

1645
01:19:17,619 --> 01:19:19,154
I'm shaking.

1646
01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:20,856
This bed, this was my bed.

1647
01:19:22,157 --> 01:19:25,327
This was my bed and all my things and...

1648
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:28,296
Oh my God! - Oh God!

1649
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:29,264
- [Charlie] Get outta here!

1650
01:19:29,297 --> 01:19:32,100
(dramatic music)

1651
01:19:39,975 --> 01:19:42,010
- [Reporter] For the second time in 28 days,

1652
01:19:42,043 --> 01:19:43,445
skeletal remains of a child

1653
01:19:43,478 --> 01:19:46,581
have been discovered on the abandoned Howard's Mill.

1654
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:49,317
Police questioned a suspect, Wayne Ritchie,

1655
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:52,053
after discovering the body of 10 year old Sarah Winston

1656
01:19:52,087 --> 01:19:55,056
who had been missing since 1994.

1657
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:56,892
- I don't care what those scientists say.

1658
01:19:56,925 --> 01:19:58,593
I know Wayne did it.

1659
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:01,596
- When I heard about Sarah Winston,

1660
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,565
I immediately, I just got chills.

1661
01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:09,471
I mean, that could've been me.

1662
01:20:09,504 --> 01:20:10,872
- I guess I'm surprised.

1663
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:13,308
I really didn't see him as the murdering kind.

1664
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:15,577
- Never, I'll never believe that he did that.

1665
01:20:18,246 --> 01:20:21,082
(phone ringing)

1666
01:20:21,116 --> 01:20:22,017
- Hello?

1667
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:26,054
- [Glynis] Hi, yes, this is Glynis Williams.

1668
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:31,092
I just, I was watching the news and the man,

1669
01:20:33,595 --> 01:20:37,399
Wayne Ritchie, I think they said his name was, I know him.

1670
01:20:37,432 --> 01:20:39,267
I know who that is.

1671
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:41,102
- [Dwight] You've met him?

1672
01:20:41,136 --> 01:20:45,907
- [Glynis] I'm positive that that man is my father.

1673
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:47,442
(singer vocalizing)

1674
01:20:47,475 --> 01:20:50,312
(shutter flashes)

1675
01:20:56,451 --> 01:20:58,954
- [Detective] What was your relationship with Sarah Winston?

1676
01:21:00,488 --> 01:21:05,126
- Not much, it was a long time ago.

1677
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,896
- Why'd you build a wall in the Howard's house, Wayne?

1678
01:21:09,564 --> 01:21:10,632
Come on now, answer the question.

1679
01:21:10,665 --> 01:21:12,267
- It wasn't safe.

1680
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:14,336
- It wasn't safe for who?

1681
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:16,137
Wasn't safe for who?

1682
01:21:17,339 --> 01:21:18,273
- Glynis, Bobby.

1683
01:21:18,306 --> 01:21:20,141
It wasn't safe for Glynis.

1684
01:21:20,175 --> 01:21:22,577
(eerie music)

1685
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,013
- [Dwight] All right, what you go for me, Dan?

1686
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:27,549
- Well, the lab results are in, brother.

1687
01:21:27,582 --> 01:21:29,084
You're not gonna believe it.

1688
01:21:30,452 --> 01:21:33,121
Wayne Ritchie and Glynis Williams are not related.

1689
01:21:33,154 --> 01:21:34,289
- [Dwight] Okay.

1690
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:38,426
- [Dan] Rebecca Howard and Glynis Williams are not related.

1691
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:39,361
- [Dwight] Wait, now what are you talkin'-

1692
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:41,596
- (tutting) There's more.

1693
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:46,635
Rebecca Howard and Jane Doe are related.

1694
01:21:48,203 --> 01:21:51,006
(dramatic music)

1695
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:55,944
(pensive music)

1696
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:02,717
- When was the last time you saw your daughter?

1697
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:05,654
- June 1st, 1979.

1698
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:09,024
- That's specific.

1699
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:11,426
- It's not the kind of thing your forget.

1700
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:13,728
- She went missing.

1701
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:15,463
You and your husband didn't tell anyone

1702
01:22:15,497 --> 01:22:17,365
and didn't report it to the cops.

1703
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:19,100
You packed up, you left.

1704
01:22:19,134 --> 01:22:21,269
You left most of your possessions behind.

1705
01:22:21,303 --> 01:22:22,671
Is that right?

1706
01:22:22,704 --> 01:22:24,139
- Not exactly.

1707
01:22:24,172 --> 01:22:26,341
- Well, what part of that is not factual?

1708
01:22:27,309 --> 01:22:29,678
- She didn't go missing.

1709
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:30,745
She was taken.

1710
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:32,414
(dramatic music)

1711
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:33,281
- By who?

1712
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:35,717
(eerie music)

1713
01:22:40,822 --> 01:22:41,723
This Glynis?

1714
01:22:43,725 --> 01:22:47,529
- [Wayne] Naw, she don't look like that no more.

1715
01:22:47,562 --> 01:22:49,564
- All right, wait a second here.

1716
01:22:53,268 --> 01:22:54,369
How 'bout her?

1717
01:22:58,073 --> 01:22:58,673
- Yep.

1718
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:03,078
- Now, Wayne, I don't understand.

1719
01:23:03,111 --> 01:23:04,346
Why do you know her?

1720
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:06,448
- I don't know who that is.

1721
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:08,049
- That's Glynis Howard!

1722
01:23:08,083 --> 01:23:10,085
The real Glynis Howard!

1723
01:23:11,786 --> 01:23:13,421
- [Kaiser] Wayne Ritchie didn't recognize

1724
01:23:13,455 --> 01:23:16,091
the photo of the real Glynis Howard,

1725
01:23:16,124 --> 01:23:18,727
but was able to identify Glynis Williams,

1726
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:22,597
although referring to her as Glynis Howard.

1727
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:24,799
He seemed just as confused as everyone else.

1728
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:28,069
- First time Glynis went missin'

1729
01:23:28,103 --> 01:23:29,437
she was just a little baby.

1730
01:23:32,574 --> 01:23:36,244
That Howard woman, she was scared,

1731
01:23:37,245 --> 01:23:40,148
but she wouldn't talk about it.

1732
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:42,817
And then she was gone just like Daniel's parents.

1733
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:44,152
- No, the Howard's went away.

1734
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:45,653
They didn't disappear, Wayne.

1735
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:52,427
- A few years later I was walkin'

1736
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:57,465
through that field and heard cryin'.

1737
01:24:00,735 --> 01:24:02,303
Saw a baby out there, Bobby.

1738
01:24:02,337 --> 01:24:03,438
Glynis comin' back.

1739
01:24:03,471 --> 01:24:05,140
Flies was all around her - wait a minute,

1740
01:24:05,173 --> 01:24:05,840
- out there in the middle - wait a minute.

1741
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,275
- of the field. - Wayne,

1742
01:24:07,308 --> 01:24:08,476
you found a baby?

1743
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:09,644
Why didn't you tell me?

1744
01:24:09,677 --> 01:24:11,146
- Well, I thought that if anybody knew,

1745
01:24:11,179 --> 01:24:12,447
then they might find out,

1746
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:13,615
they might come back for,

1747
01:24:13,648 --> 01:24:15,750
take her back where took her the first time.

1748
01:24:15,784 --> 01:24:17,719
I was just tryin' to make things

1749
01:24:17,752 --> 01:24:20,755
the way they was before for her.

1750
01:24:23,491 --> 01:24:24,726
Figured she's better off.

1751
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:29,197
- Why did you build a wall in that house, Wayne?

1752
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:31,833
- Last time I was down there,

1753
01:24:33,935 --> 01:24:36,171
there wasn't nobody down there.

1754
01:24:36,204 --> 01:24:37,238
- [Bob] Okay.

1755
01:24:37,272 --> 01:24:38,139
- All right?

1756
01:24:38,173 --> 01:24:38,840
I know that.

1757
01:24:39,774 --> 01:24:42,343
Things was gettin' dangerous down there.

1758
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:44,679
Caught Glynis playin' down there.

1759
01:24:45,847 --> 01:24:49,784
And the pipes were exposed, leakin'.

1760
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:52,153
Seen a rat down there.

1761
01:24:52,187 --> 01:24:56,424
So, I walled it up.

1762
01:24:57,659 --> 01:25:00,595
- And you buried some children's toys down there, too?

1763
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:07,635
- Yeah well, I was just sayin' bye.

1764
01:25:07,669 --> 01:25:10,405
(pensive music)

1765
01:25:12,507 --> 01:25:13,608
- This just all seems to point

1766
01:25:13,641 --> 01:25:15,243
more and more to Wayne Ritchie.

1767
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:17,545
The fact that we have a body in the room

1768
01:25:17,579 --> 01:25:19,581
that he admits he sealed,

1769
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:25,587
then we've got a body in a pond that he had field.

1770
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:28,423
The question now is, where is Emily?

1771
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:33,194
- [Kaiser] Are you happy with the arrest?

1772
01:25:33,228 --> 01:25:35,697
(somber music)

1773
01:25:37,465 --> 01:25:38,466
So, are we done?

1774
01:25:40,502 --> 01:25:41,703
- No.

1775
01:25:41,736 --> 01:25:43,304
I still need to find my wife.

1776
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:04,826
(Dwight sighs)

1777
01:26:09,364 --> 01:26:11,666
Wayne, I need your help.

1778
01:26:11,699 --> 01:26:12,834
- All right.

1779
01:26:12,867 --> 01:26:14,936
I mean, I'll help however I can help.

1780
01:26:16,571 --> 01:26:17,438
- All right.

1781
01:26:18,573 --> 01:26:19,707
What I'm havin' a problem wrappin'

1782
01:26:19,741 --> 01:26:22,010
my mind around is this.

1783
01:26:22,043 --> 01:26:23,545
You admit to all these things,

1784
01:26:23,578 --> 01:26:25,480
buildin' that wall? - Yeah.

1785
01:26:26,414 --> 01:26:27,649
- Takin' that little baby,

1786
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:30,852
but what about Emily?

1787
01:26:30,885 --> 01:26:33,388
What about my wife, Wayne?

1788
01:26:33,421 --> 01:26:34,856
- I told you Dwight, told you from the start,

1789
01:26:34,889 --> 01:26:36,424
I had nothin' to do with that.

1790
01:26:36,457 --> 01:26:40,328
I had nothin' to do with that.

1791
01:26:41,462 --> 01:26:42,597
- [Wayne] Why are you in the video

1792
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:44,599
she took right before she went missin'?

1793
01:26:44,632 --> 01:26:48,603
That's you standin' right there.

1794
01:26:49,637 --> 01:26:50,738
- I don't know.

1795
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:53,474
That wasn't me.

1796
01:26:53,508 --> 01:26:56,611
It's 'cause I go out there sometimes

1797
01:26:56,644 --> 01:26:58,279
and when I walk around I hunt.

1798
01:26:58,313 --> 01:26:59,814
That ain't a crime.

1799
01:26:59,847 --> 01:27:00,949
- No, that's not a crime.

1800
01:27:00,982 --> 01:27:02,717
But you didn't notice her there

1801
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:04,752
even though she was talkin' awfully loud

1802
01:27:04,786 --> 01:27:05,954
and she wasn't exactly blendin' in?

1803
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:07,355
- Well, so what?

1804
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:09,424
If I did, it don't mean I hurt her.

1805
01:27:09,457 --> 01:27:11,726
It don't mean I done nothin' with her.

1806
01:27:11,759 --> 01:27:15,563
Sometimes I go out there and I watch people a little bit,

1807
01:27:16,598 --> 01:27:19,801
see if they disappear or whatnot.

1808
01:27:20,935 --> 01:27:21,836
- Are you sayin' you saw what happened to her?

1809
01:27:21,869 --> 01:27:22,770
- Naw.

1810
01:27:22,804 --> 01:27:25,607
A dog ran off into the woods,

1811
01:27:26,741 --> 01:27:31,579
and I followed the dog into the woods.

1812
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:33,948
I figured she went home.

1813
01:27:33,982 --> 01:27:36,684
- If you don't have anything to hide,

1814
01:27:36,718 --> 01:27:38,553
while are you always chasin' people off that property?

1815
01:27:38,586 --> 01:27:42,957
- 'Cause I wanna make sure nobody out there disappears again

1816
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:46,728
and I wanna make sure nobody else pops up,

1817
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:50,465
like Glynis done.

1818
01:27:50,498 --> 01:27:51,332
- You were just walkin' by?

1819
01:27:51,366 --> 01:27:52,600
- I was just walkin' by.

1820
01:27:52,634 --> 01:27:54,602
They took her, not me.

1821
01:27:54,636 --> 01:27:55,470
- Who?

1822
01:27:55,503 --> 01:27:56,804
Who took her?

1823
01:27:56,838 --> 01:27:58,373
- I had nothin' to do with this.

1824
01:27:58,406 --> 01:27:59,674
I had nothin' to do with this.

1825
01:27:59,707 --> 01:28:01,676
I had nothin' to, - This person disappeared

1826
01:28:01,709 --> 01:28:03,878
- y'all can... - only a few weeks ago.

1827
01:28:03,911 --> 01:28:04,746
Who took her, Wayne?

1828
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:07,348
(eerie music)

1829
01:28:08,983 --> 01:28:11,686
- Now you know we've got several people out there

1830
01:28:11,719 --> 01:28:14,055
that claim they saw lights

1831
01:28:14,088 --> 01:28:17,558
but there's no proof of that so we can't go anything there.

1832
01:28:17,592 --> 01:28:18,960
And you've got the Lopez's,

1833
01:28:18,993 --> 01:28:23,598
you've got Sarah Winston and you've got Glynis Howard

1834
01:28:23,631 --> 01:28:26,067
all disappearing from the same land.

1835
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:27,702
- [Roger] Sarah!

1836
01:28:27,735 --> 01:28:28,569
- [Sarah's Mom] Sarah?

1837
01:28:28,603 --> 01:28:29,837
- [Roger] Sarah!

1838
01:28:29,871 --> 01:28:31,472
Did you see where she went? - Where is she?

1839
01:28:31,506 --> 01:28:33,541
- Some people believe theoretically

1840
01:28:33,574 --> 01:28:35,410
that the potential for traveling through time,

1841
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:37,879
forward through time is possible.

1842
01:28:37,912 --> 01:28:42,917
(singer vocalizing) (soft music)

1843
01:28:44,752 --> 01:28:49,123
- 1979, Glynis Howard goes missing age six, all right?

1844
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:51,092
She shows back up forensics report

1845
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:55,697
that Glynis Howard's body found in a wall dead at age six.

1846
01:28:55,730 --> 01:28:57,031
Look, that's 10 years.

1847
01:28:58,499 --> 01:29:01,703
Sarah Winston, disappears at age 10, 1994.

1848
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:06,107
10 years later forensics again says

1849
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:09,077
she shows up drowned, dead but the same age.

1850
01:29:10,078 --> 01:29:12,847
- There's also the twin paradox.

1851
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:16,050
The idea being that if you take identical twins

1852
01:29:16,084 --> 01:29:17,652
under the right circumstances,

1853
01:29:17,685 --> 01:29:20,755
one could travel to space and returning

1854
01:29:20,788 --> 01:29:23,991
have aged slower than the one who remained on Earth.

1855
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:26,160
- Now, what's with the 10 years?

1856
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:28,162
Now, you tell me how somebody's,

1857
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:30,164
they disappear at a certain age,

1858
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:31,999
their bodies are kept and then they show

1859
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:35,670
back up dead at a certain age.

1860
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:38,940
- So, you're sayin' that Emily will come back in 10 years?

1861
01:29:40,074 --> 01:29:43,077
- More importantly, will she show back up

1862
01:29:43,111 --> 01:29:46,180
in 10 years the same age as when she disappeared?

1863
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:48,816
(eerie music)

1864
01:29:51,652 --> 01:29:53,488
- [Kaiser] Maybe Roger Winston's theories

1865
01:29:53,521 --> 01:29:55,757
weren't so far fetched.

1866
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:58,559
Maybe he's not as crazy as everyone thinks.

1867
01:30:01,129 --> 01:30:03,531
- Twin Falls, Idaho, 1987,

1868
01:30:03,564 --> 01:30:05,666
this is an interview with a boy named Cole Thomas,

1869
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:07,135
eight year old boy.

1870
01:30:07,168 --> 01:30:09,103
He claimed he'd been missin' for two days

1871
01:30:09,137 --> 01:30:12,006
and when they found him he'd only been gone,

1872
01:30:12,039 --> 01:30:13,841
he said four minutes, okay?

1873
01:30:13,875 --> 01:30:16,077
So, the only thing that he remembered

1874
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:19,213
was the distinct feelin' of bein' watched.

1875
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:22,550
Texarkana, Arkansas, 2001, right?

1876
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:25,820
"I saw my sister climbing through the second floor window

1877
01:30:25,853 --> 01:30:27,054
but not really climbing.

1878
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:28,890
It was more like she was floatin',

1879
01:30:28,923 --> 01:30:31,959
and when I got to the window, she was gone," right?

1880
01:30:31,993 --> 01:30:34,529
- And there were triangular lights

1881
01:30:34,562 --> 01:30:37,231
that appeared at the horizon.

1882
01:30:37,265 --> 01:30:40,968
- The lights comin' in the window.

1883
01:30:41,002 --> 01:30:43,671
- They would rotate and move.

1884
01:30:43,704 --> 01:30:46,073
- And lights floatin' in the distance.

1885
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:48,009
- I got a lot of this stuff here

1886
01:30:48,042 --> 01:30:49,644
and it's just missin' persons

1887
01:30:49,677 --> 01:30:52,713
with no recollection of where they've been, okay?

1888
01:30:52,747 --> 01:30:55,950
Just, they all know that they've been watched.

1889
01:30:55,983 --> 01:31:00,888
- They were all lined up on the horizon, watching.

1890
01:31:02,757 --> 01:31:07,762
(wind chime chiming) (pensive music)

1891
01:31:09,163 --> 01:31:11,899
- The entities appear to study their subjects,

1892
01:31:11,933 --> 01:31:13,768
first as many abducted individuals

1893
01:31:13,801 --> 01:31:17,572
share the feeling of being watched.

1894
01:31:17,605 --> 01:31:18,739
All right?

1895
01:31:18,773 --> 01:31:20,141
"Sometimes months before the incident,

1896
01:31:20,174 --> 01:31:22,677
while there are numerous vivid accounts of abduction

1897
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:26,881
there are just as many lost time incidents," all right?

1898
01:31:26,914 --> 01:31:30,718
"The victim goes missing for days, months, even years,

1899
01:31:30,751 --> 01:31:32,787
with no memory of being gone

1900
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:34,755
and in the case of Marilyn Graham,

1901
01:31:34,789 --> 01:31:36,290
showing no signs of aging

1902
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:39,160
despite being missing for over 10 years."

1903
01:31:39,193 --> 01:31:41,028
Okay, look at all of these, all right?

1904
01:31:41,062 --> 01:31:44,632
And you wanna say that you don't believe?

1905
01:31:44,665 --> 01:31:48,102
- I'm lookin' at all this, but what are you sayin' here?

1906
01:31:49,637 --> 01:31:50,538
- What am I saying?

1907
01:31:52,673 --> 01:31:53,541
Just read it.

1908
01:31:55,176 --> 01:31:58,913
- [Kaiser] If the 10 year time travel theory is possible,

1909
01:31:58,946 --> 01:32:00,581
could it be that Glynis Howard returned

1910
01:32:00,615 --> 01:32:02,884
to the exact same spot in the basement

1911
01:32:02,917 --> 01:32:04,252
where she disappeared only

1912
01:32:04,285 --> 01:32:07,321
to find herself trapped behind the wall Wayne built?

1913
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:08,289
Did a starving child try to claw

1914
01:32:08,322 --> 01:32:10,958
her way out of what would become her tomb?

1915
01:32:12,293 --> 01:32:13,794
And did Sarah Winston return

1916
01:32:13,828 --> 01:32:15,196
to the same spot she disappeared

1917
01:32:15,229 --> 01:32:17,732
where upon it had been built and then drowned?

1918
01:32:20,101 --> 01:32:21,969
Did Roger Winston just miss an opportunity

1919
01:32:22,003 --> 01:32:24,672
to save his daughter from drowning

1920
01:32:24,705 --> 01:32:27,008
the night he found her bow floating in the pond?

1921
01:32:29,977 --> 01:32:31,879
- [Roger] I think she was trying to come home.

1922
01:32:31,913 --> 01:32:36,918
(singer vocalizing) (soft music)

1923
01:32:38,953 --> 01:32:41,355
- [Kaiser] But then what about the Lopez's?

1924
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:42,290
Where did they go?

1925
01:32:43,324 --> 01:32:44,692
And what about Glynis Williams

1926
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:46,928
who Wayne found in the Howard's field?

1927
01:32:46,961 --> 01:32:48,129
Where did she come from?

1928
01:32:50,364 --> 01:32:53,334
And then there is a reason why we started this journey,

1929
01:32:53,367 --> 01:32:54,735
Dwight's wife, Emily.

1930
01:32:56,137 --> 01:32:57,872
Maybe it all doesn't add up perfectly

1931
01:32:57,905 --> 01:33:00,007
but something unnatural is clearly happening

1932
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:03,144
on this abandoned piece of land called Howard's Mill.

1933
01:33:07,882 --> 01:33:09,050
- [Wayne] No, you need to understand,

1934
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:12,987
sometimes it takes people and sometimes it gives people.

1935
01:33:14,288 --> 01:33:15,923
Best just to stay away.

1936
01:33:18,826 --> 01:33:20,895
- For the first time in my life,

1937
01:33:20,928 --> 01:33:22,663
I really don't know what to think.

1938
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,970
I mean, we finally got Wayne Ritchie in jail.

1939
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:32,907
I don't know if he did it, Kaiser.

1940
01:33:36,377 --> 01:33:40,047
You got people movin' at different speeds,

1941
01:33:40,081 --> 01:33:41,882
reappearin' and disappearin'.

1942
01:33:41,916 --> 01:33:43,050
Little girls just poppin' up

1943

in rooms with no windows or doors, and Emily.

1944
01:33:48,990 --> 01:33:50,157
I can't find my wife.

1945
01:33:54,095 --> 01:33:55,029
This whole thing's crazy.

1946
01:33:55,062 --> 01:33:56,797
It's just got my mind spinnin'.

1949
01:34:04,105 --> 01:34:04,972

01:34:08,275 --> 01:34:10,911
- I mean, yeah.

1952

I have to believe that,

1953
01:34:13,347 --> 01:34:15,116
but if she doesn't,

1954
01:34:15,149 --> 01:34:19,920
I will be right here 10 years from now waitin' on her.

1955
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:24,025
I just...

1956
01:34:24,058 --> 01:34:26,794
