1
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,980
<i> The last time anyone counted, </i>

2
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,300
<i> 53 million people
were dying every year. </i>

3
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,020
<i> 150 thousand every day
and 107 every minute. </i>

4
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:33,979
<i> That was in normal times. </i>

5
00:00:36,298 --> 00:00:38,978
<i> Now, every one of those dead
gets up and kills another person, </i>

6
00:00:39,778 --> 00:00:41,778
<i> and every one of those gets
up and kills </i>

7
00:00:42,578 --> 00:00:48,178
<i> on top of that, suicide,
murder, chaos and us ...</i>

8
00:00:48,697 --> 00:00:49,697
<i> the guard .... </i>

9
00:00:49,977 --> 00:00:52,377
<i> we added more than out fair
share to the body count, but ...</i>

10
00:00:52,817 --> 00:00:53,937
<i> ... it didn't do any good </i>

11
00:00:54,696 --> 00:00:56,176
<i> Bring a stretcher over here.
Move it. </i>

12
00:00:56,696 --> 00:00:58,016
<i> the dead were coming back to life. </i>

13
00:00:58,736 --> 00:01:00,976
<i> We should have been afraid
of them. But we weren't. </i>

14
00:01:01,476 --> 00:01:04,456
<i> They were easy enough to
kill, except when they were ...</i>

15
00:01:04,795 --> 00:01:05,855
<i> ... your buddies. </i>

16
00:01:14,295 --> 00:01:15,295
It's time.

17
00:01:22,613 --> 00:01:24,013
You sent us to that hell hole.

18
00:01:25,253 --> 00:01:27,493
You got D.J. killed and
now he's got to get killed again.

19
00:01:29,013 --> 00:01:29,893
You fucked up, Lou.

20
00:01:31,213 --> 00:01:32,373
You can't make it right,

21
00:01:33,573 --> 00:01:35,133
but you can do the right thing

22
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:45,931
I can't.

23
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,209
Don't. Don't.

24
00:02:23,967 --> 00:02:24,767
So there.

25
00:02:24,807 --> 00:02:26,807
- can I get some backup up here?
- This sucks.

26
00:02:27,006 --> 00:02:27,886
We got shots fired.

27
00:02:28,126 --> 00:02:29,126
I never signed up for this shit.

28
00:02:30,766 --> 00:02:32,326
We're better off on our own.

29
00:02:33,966 --> 00:02:34,886
What the hell's going on?

30
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:37,205
Who’s down?

31
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:47,444
We went AWOL right around the
same time the rest of the world did.

32
00:02:48,604 --> 00:02:49,924
We became stick up guys.

33
00:02:50,564 --> 00:02:51,884
Stopping people on the road ...

34
00:02:52,244 --> 00:02:53,644
- Hi there.
- ... taking whatever they had.

35
00:02:54,244 --> 00:02:58,164
- Is it nice to see you guys.
- We held up this bunch of
kids in a Winnebago...

36
00:02:58,164 --> 00:02:59,562
...shooting a documentary
about themselves.

37
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,922
- What's with the camera?
- Just making a movie.

38
00:03:02,442 --> 00:03:04,362
Oh, that so.

39
00:03:04,922 --> 00:03:06,322
Fucking movie went out on the net.

40
00:03:07,202 --> 00:03:09,042
- Millions of hits.
- Where did you get all the stuff?

41
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:10,402
I became notorious ...

42
00:03:10,762 --> 00:03:12,682
- ... could of got an agent.
- Mind turning that off son.

43
00:03:13,202 --> 00:03:15,442
Made a fortune if there
was anyone left to care.

44
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,680
Turn it the fuck off!

45
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,120
It had become an
us against them world ...

46
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,720
- Now.
- ... all we were looking for
was a place where there was no...

47
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
... "them."

48
00:04:03,635 --> 00:04:06,395
Well, that's another one we
don't have to worry about.

49
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:07,275
Amen.

50
00:04:07,355 --> 00:04:09,955
I would like it if you just say
an Amen to put an end to all this.

51
00:04:10,155 --> 00:04:11,875
I'd like it too, Captain. I would

52
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:13,275
Are you all with me then?

53
00:04:13,475 --> 00:04:14,115
- Aye, Aye
- Yes, Captain.

54
00:04:14,315 --> 00:04:15,215
Damn right.

55
00:04:15,954 --> 00:04:16,634
I'm asking.

56
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:18,434
Are all of you with me?

57
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:21,353
You're being too strict,
just as you always been.

58
00:04:21,913 --> 00:04:23,153
Being strict is a father's burden.

59
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,953
More like a daughter's burden,
if you ask me.

60
00:04:25,713 --> 00:04:26,553
What if I die?

61
00:04:27,153 --> 00:04:28,553
Would you be strict enough to
gun one of your own?

62
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:31,273
- What if you die?
- Don't get your hopes up.

63
00:04:31,513 --> 00:04:34,773
No, I mean it what if you die
and get up and walk?

64
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:36,912
Would any of us be strict
enough to gun you down?

65
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:38,871
You won't have to
I'll shoot myself.

66
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:40,471
You might change your view of things.

67
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:41,991
Dying don't change a person's view's

68
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:44,031
all a dead man can do is
remember what he used to be

69
00:04:44,031 --> 00:04:46,391
and keep on trying to be the same.

70
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:47,751
On to the next.

71
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:50,651
We weren't there
in the beginning

72
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,270
We heard about what
happened afterwards.

73
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:58,010
This old coot Patrick O'Flynn
decided that the living would be
better off if the dead stayed dead.

74
00:04:59,149 --> 00:05:02,109
Put a posse together and went around
the island trying to clean things up.

75
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:06,189
Not everybody was on his side.

76
00:05:06,588 --> 00:05:07,548
Let's go.

77
00:05:13,348 --> 00:05:18,228
Law enforcement advises that
if anyone is forced to defend
themselves against attack

78
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:20,747
Make every effort to incapicitate
the attacker’s brain

79
00:05:21,027 --> 00:05:22,107
Any news from town?

80
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:24,306
No.

81
00:05:25,786 --> 00:05:28,226
I'm just gonna sit and wait awhile.

82
00:05:28,226 --> 00:05:29,626
For what, a miracle?

83
00:05:30,186 --> 00:05:33,926
Been known to happen,
if you believe what the book says.

84
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:36,346
Are they all settled in up there?

85
00:05:36,347 --> 00:05:37,065
All settled in.

86
00:05:38,384 --> 00:05:39,644
No commotions?

87
00:05:42,944 --> 00:05:44,144
None that I've heard.

88
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:54,064
Patrick O'Flynn.

89
00:05:54,703 --> 00:05:55,883
Matthew Muldoon.

90
00:05:58,582 --> 00:06:00,922
I know we're conserving, but ...

91
00:06:03,222 --> 00:06:04,382
Where are your children?

92
00:06:04,982 --> 00:06:05,742
Upstairs.

93
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:07,682
They're in bed.

94
00:06:08,062 --> 00:06:11,662
It came to me that one of them had
an accident a couple of days ago.

95
00:06:12,181 --> 00:06:15,181
Yeah the girl fell off her bike, so ...

96
00:06:15,701 --> 00:06:16,921
And the boy?

97
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,800
- Went to help her and...
- Got hit by a car didn't he?

98
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,180
Is the boy all
right Matthew or not?

99
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,059
I believe whatever you tell me.

100
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:32,819
- He's ah ...
- Maybe I should go upstairs
and look for myself.

101
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:36,699
Don't you go up there.

102
00:06:37,258 --> 00:06:38,138
Beth, I have to do this.

103
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,658
You don't have to do this
you enjoy doing it.

104
00:06:40,778 --> 00:06:42,418
No, I promise you that

105
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:45,698
I don't want to go upstairs.
I don't want to see
what your boys become.

106
00:06:45,977 --> 00:06:47,137
He ain't become nothing.

107
00:06:47,937 --> 00:06:50,377
He is still just and only my boy.

108
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:51,657
Don't do it Beth!

109
00:06:53,937 --> 00:06:54,537
Beth!

110
00:07:06,055 --> 00:07:07,055
Oh, my God.

111
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:10,175
You damn stupid fool.
You might have stopped this.

112
00:07:11,815 --> 00:07:13,775
- How?
- By telling me the truth.

113
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:16,695
What you wanna do with her now?
Take her upstairs and put her to bed?

114
00:07:17,013 --> 00:07:19,413
No, I'll do what I have to do.

115
00:07:21,413 --> 00:07:22,933
If you'll just give me the means.

116
00:08:19,606 --> 00:08:20,566
It's both of them.

117
00:08:35,685 --> 00:08:37,245
I'll do it, I will

118
00:08:38,524 --> 00:08:42,604
But I'd give my soul if someone
will step up and do it for me.

119
00:08:43,644 --> 00:08:44,924
No one’s going to help you.

120
00:08:45,644 --> 00:08:47,324
Not this time, not children.

121
00:08:59,402 --> 00:09:01,282
There's been enough
killing for one day

122
00:09:07,162 --> 00:09:08,762
You boys must not have heard me.

123
00:09:09,561 --> 00:09:11,321
I said there's
been enough killing.

124
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:18,351
You have us out numbered the way
the Muldoons have outnumbered the
O'Flynns from the beginning

125
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,760
Now, listen to me Seamus.

126
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,040
Plum's always been a safe place

127
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,120
where a man can
live a pride for life.

128
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:26,799
We can keep it that way

129
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:30,759
but only if we do
what we have to do.

130
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:34,439
Killing our own kind like
they didn't belong to us.

131
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,599
Putting the dead to sleep,

132
00:09:37,438 --> 00:09:39,598
before they put
all of us to sleep.

133
00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:40,837
I have faith.

134
00:09:41,157 --> 00:09:43,997
The day of Judgement will forgive
me and prove me right.

135
00:09:44,437 --> 00:09:45,877
You're are wrong, Muldoon.

136
00:09:49,717 --> 00:09:50,637
What are you going
to do with them?

137
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:54,197
Their Muldoons
that's why we need to save them.

138
00:09:54,197 --> 00:09:56,197
You can't save a person
who is already dead.

139
00:09:56,756 --> 00:09:57,916
Maybe they’re not dead.

140
00:09:58,195 --> 00:10:00,555
Maybe they got some kind
of sickness or something.

141
00:10:01,675 --> 00:10:03,315
Somebody's gonna find
a cure for this.

142
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:06,915
It might take 100 years
but somebody's going to find a cure.

143
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:12,235
The only families who ever lived on
this island were yours and mine.

144
00:10:13,194 --> 00:10:16,434
No strangers, until now.

145
00:10:17,394 --> 00:10:19,874
There's a stranger in our mist
Patrick O'Flynn.

146
00:10:21,873 --> 00:10:22,793
and it's you ...

147
00:10:25,913 --> 00:10:27,473
Lay down your hardware.

148
00:10:35,352 --> 00:10:38,432
Now outside all of ya.

149
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,470
What's going to happen to him?

150
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:00,229
If he don't turn my way ...

151
00:11:01,908 --> 00:11:03,428
... I'll have to shoot him.

152
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:05,548
Seamus.

153
00:11:07,428 --> 00:11:08,708
He's my dad.

154
00:11:11,228 --> 00:11:13,848
I need to be rid of him.

155
00:11:15,428 --> 00:11:17,688
This island needs
to be rid of him.

156
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:20,926
You can put him on a boat.

157
00:11:35,865 --> 00:11:37,545
Who's coming with me?

158
00:11:38,104 --> 00:11:39,664
I've been with you
a long time, Captain.

159
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:40,984
So I'll stick.

160
00:11:50,663 --> 00:11:51,503
That all?

161
00:11:51,823 --> 00:11:52,943
We like it here, Patrick.

162
00:11:53,343 --> 00:11:56,263
We think the best way of seeing
this through is here on Plum.

163
00:11:59,222 --> 00:12:00,262
Come along, Janet.

164
00:12:01,582 --> 00:12:02,822
I like it here too, Dad.

165
00:12:04,261 --> 00:12:05,701
So you're leaving me now?

166
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:07,581
I'm not leaving.

167
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:09,901
You are.

168
00:12:14,221 --> 00:12:17,741
If there wasn't any Muldoons
none of us would be leaving.

169
00:12:49,297 --> 00:12:50,777
Why are zombies
good at oral sex?

170
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,257
Why zombies are good at oral
sex? I don't know.

171
00:12:53,616 --> 00:12:55,836
Because they'll eat anything you
put in front of them.

172
00:12:58,096 --> 00:12:59,356
Did you write that one?

173
00:13:04,975 --> 00:13:06,735
Why don't Zombies eat politicians?

174
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:07,295
I don't know.

175
00:13:07,295 --> 00:13:08,295
Professional courtesy.

176
00:13:13,094 --> 00:13:16,394
- Garbage
- I think it's funny.

177
00:13:16,654 --> 00:13:18,734
I haven't been able to
get a signal for days.

178
00:13:18,735 --> 00:13:19,613
so there.

179
00:13:19,693 --> 00:13:22,493
I'm telling you man all the
wrong people are dying.

180
00:13:22,493 --> 00:13:24,893
Seems like all we
got left is assholes.

181
00:13:25,812 --> 00:13:27,852
Deadheads.
Their calling them Deadheads now.

182
00:13:28,332 --> 00:13:29,852
The whole world is
going fucking mental.

183
00:13:31,372 --> 00:13:32,532
Hi, mamacita.

184
00:13:32,932 --> 00:13:35,212
Cut that out will ya,
you're turning me on.

185
00:13:35,612 --> 00:13:38,652
I'd let you lick me Franny
but guys just don't know how.

186
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:40,251
You give me 5 minutes

187
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:41,651
I'll change your life forever.

188
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,610
I don't have 5 minutes amigo
nobody does these days.

189
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:45,890
That's too bad.

190
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,570
No what's too bad is there is
not another bitch in this litter.

191
00:13:59,448 --> 00:14:02,668
Still generating power
but nobody is around.

192
00:14:04,848 --> 00:14:05,608
Turn that thing off.

193
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:06,848
It's funny.

194
00:14:07,008 --> 00:14:08,088
Turn it off now.

195
00:14:08,608 --> 00:14:09,448
I hear something.

196
00:14:12,568 --> 00:14:14,008
That ain't far off, come on.

197
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,126
Hey look at this.

198
00:14:25,446 --> 00:14:26,526
Maybe there's money inside.

199
00:14:26,886 --> 00:14:28,326
Money don't mean shit anymore.

200
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:30,886
Money will always
be money, my friend.

201
00:14:31,725 --> 00:14:33,245
If you have a lot of money
at the end of the world

202
00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:35,885
you can buy yourself a nice
condominium in heaven huh.

203
00:14:38,725 --> 00:14:39,805
Ring around the Rosie.

204
00:14:40,204 --> 00:14:41,564
Come in on four sides
and once we're there

205
00:14:42,084 --> 00:14:42,764
make some noise.

206
00:14:42,964 --> 00:14:44,764
- Move out.
- Let's go check it out.

207
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,123
- I thought she had ya.
- I thought so too.

208
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:52,523
I thought I was dead.

209
00:14:53,243 --> 00:14:55,083
- I nailed her ass didn't I?
- Sure enough did.

210
00:14:55,723 --> 00:14:57,433
Who was she your momma?

211
00:14:58,923 --> 00:14:59,713
Shit.

212
00:15:00,522 --> 00:15:02,072
How many you out there?

213
00:15:02,281 --> 00:15:04,311
You’re out numbered
and out gunned Holmes.

214
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,681
Set that iron down.

215
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:09,211
You'se gonna have to make me
set it down there mandrake.

216
00:15:10,681 --> 00:15:12,761
Oh, crap.

217
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:15,671
Is there anyone else inclinded
to point a gun at me?

218
00:15:16,561 --> 00:15:17,901
That's good.

219
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,890
Cause I don't like shooting
people I don't know.

220
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,839
Well, maybe we should
get to know each other.

221
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:25,129
Who the hell would
want to get to know you?

222
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:27,479
- Two.
- Even I can count better than that.

223
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:29,839
- Three.
- Three is company, senor.

224
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:32,199
Four. Is a crowd.

225
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:33,119
Oh, crap.

226
00:15:35,838 --> 00:15:36,718
What the hell's that?

227
00:15:37,398 --> 00:15:38,838
Oh, that.

228
00:15:39,158 --> 00:15:40,798
That is just some
fun we was having.

229
00:15:41,397 --> 00:15:41,997
Fun?

230
00:15:42,397 --> 00:15:46,227
Them things out there,
they was chasing us so
we done something about it.

231
00:16:00,595 --> 00:16:01,875
Oh, God.

232
00:16:34,112 --> 00:16:34,992
Why did you do that?

233
00:16:35,312 --> 00:16:38,892
They come after us like I said
all in a pack like.

234
00:16:38,892 --> 00:16:41,632
They come after us
so we killed them.

235
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,910
That's right.

236
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,830
There are a lot of way
you can kill somebody.

237
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,990
For example, if I wanna shoot
you in the head, I'd use this.

238
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,110
Now if I wanted to cut you up
into little pieces, I'd use this.

239
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,070
But then I might blow
up a chunk of the forest.

240
00:16:56,789 --> 00:16:58,969
If I wanted to blow
up a chunk of the forest ...

241
00:16:59,368 --> 00:17:01,988
... I'd use one of these bad boys.

242
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:03,348
But you know what?

243
00:17:03,628 --> 00:17:07,068
I'm thinking I might
save that for a rainy day.

244
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:08,868
Yeah, you do that bubba ...

245
00:17:15,747 --> 00:17:17,667
Don't shoot please.
I'm not one of them, I swear.

246
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:19,467
Kenny, stop.

247
00:17:22,826 --> 00:17:24,386
I just came along for the ride.

248
00:17:24,786 --> 00:17:26,746
That's a lousy bunch of friends
to be riding around with.

249
00:17:27,345 --> 00:17:28,865
Lousy times make lousy people.

250
00:17:30,025 --> 00:17:31,065
Are you?

251
00:17:32,305 --> 00:17:33,025
Lousy people?

252
00:17:33,505 --> 00:17:34,625
- No.
- Yes

253
00:17:36,865 --> 00:17:38,105
I'm not choosy.

254
00:17:40,104 --> 00:17:41,344
You forgot to finish the job.

255
00:17:48,703 --> 00:17:49,783
You're dangerous, kid.

256
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:51,143
But not as dangerous as me.

257
00:17:52,303 --> 00:17:54,023
You coming or we
leaving you behind, huh?

258
00:17:57,823 --> 00:17:58,743
Just give me a minute.

259
00:18:11,301 --> 00:18:12,141
What are you doing?

260
00:18:12,701 --> 00:18:15,181
- Stealing their shit?
- This is my shit
they stole it from me.

261
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,099
What do you think?

262
00:18:21,339 --> 00:18:22,539
Maybe we should take this.

263
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:24,499
It is better than
those open air Jeeps.

264
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:26,259
We're going to need keys.

265
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:28,299
One of those dead guys
back there must have them.

266
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:29,819
Not anymore.

267
00:18:45,297 --> 00:18:46,497
Probably nothing in it anyway.

268
00:18:47,056 --> 00:18:48,496
Who would be stupid enough to

269
00:18:48,496 --> 00:18:50,056
leave a bunch of money sitting
in the middle of nowhere?

270
00:18:50,176 --> 00:18:51,936
Those guys look
like geniuses to you?

271
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:58,616
One million, three hundred 
and thrity three dollars

272
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:02,496
- You count it?
- No, it's written on a ledger.

273
00:19:05,294 --> 00:19:06,734
Can you give us the key?

274
00:19:07,534 --> 00:19:10,094
You can have this key.

275
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:11,854
It starts the truck.

276
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:13,974
I would like that one.

277
00:19:14,414 --> 00:19:15,254
I don't think so.

278
00:19:21,132 --> 00:19:25,092
Well we are not going to stand here
waiting for this kid to take a shit

279
00:19:25,692 --> 00:19:26,372
Cisco. Drive.

280
00:19:31,452 --> 00:19:33,012
Hey, Cisco wants to
know where we're going.

281
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,352
We will be hitting I95 soon so
we have two choices, North or south?

282
00:19:36,411 --> 00:19:37,391
South.

283
00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:39,991
- Who died and made you king?
- Just a suggestion.

284
00:19:40,131 --> 00:19:42,981
Don't make any suggestions, all right?
North, Cisco.

285
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,170
Can I ask you why?

286
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,770
Going north we got a better
shot of getting closer

287
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,250
to no place.

288
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:52,289
Yeah, we don't want no place.

289
00:19:52,729 --> 00:19:55,169
We want some place where
the shit can't get at us.

290
00:19:55,489 --> 00:19:56,089
Like where?

291
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:58,369
Like an island.

292
00:19:59,009 --> 00:20:00,649
Where are we gonna
find an island?

293
00:20:00,848 --> 00:20:03,048
Let me see...
Maybe in the ocean?

294
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,448
Don't be a wise ass, kid.

295
00:20:04,728 --> 00:20:05,988
Sorry.

296
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:09,207
Have you guys ever hear of
this guy, Captain Courageous?

297
00:20:09,487 --> 00:20:10,007
Who?

298
00:20:10,207 --> 00:20:11,927
Online, this guy

299
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:17,707
- You call that a computer?
- It is a computer

300
00:20:17,727 --> 00:20:18,967
Piece of shit, PC.

301
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:20,687
I think it's cool so there.

302
00:20:20,688 --> 00:20:23,286
That is not cool, this is cool.

303
00:20:30,165 --> 00:20:32,685
Friends, I am going
to keep this simple.

304
00:20:33,205 --> 00:20:35,885
See this isn't a sales pitch,
there's nothing in it for me.

305
00:20:36,645 --> 00:20:38,605
My ass, that ain't a
sales pitch what is it?

306
00:20:39,444 --> 00:20:42,474
This think that's come down
on us, whatever it is

307
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:45,683
Don't seem to be able to answer
these questions, but it's terrible

308
00:20:45,843 --> 00:20:48,483
So I am inviting you'se to
come on over and join us.

309
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,123
Come on over to Plum.

310
00:20:50,563 --> 00:20:53,083
See it's an island off
the coast of Delaware.

311
00:20:53,403 --> 00:20:54,603
Route 1 to Belford

312
00:20:54,882 --> 00:20:56,642
Follow the signs
to Slaughter Beach

313
00:20:57,162 --> 00:20:59,562
If you get here I promise
you will be welcome.

314
00:20:59,762 --> 00:21:03,442
It's a small place,
small and under control.

315
00:21:03,921 --> 00:21:05,041
That part sounds good.

316
00:21:05,281 --> 00:21:06,361
So, think about it.

317
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:07,921
Come on over.

318
00:21:10,081 --> 00:21:12,441
It's got to be some kind of a scam.
What else can it be, huh?

319
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,440
So this guy finds
some place to escape.

320
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,760
Just what we're
all looking for.

321
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,840
Yeah and if we find it I'm not going
to advertise for people to join us.

322
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,480
It's worth a try.
What do we got to lose?

323
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:25,199
I thought we agreed that we
are better off on our own.

324
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:28,678
Ain't got us very far has it?

325
00:21:29,078 --> 00:21:31,078
I don't want to sign
up with anybody, Kenny.

326
00:21:32,838 --> 00:21:35,478
I'm fucking finished
with signing up, man.

327
00:21:36,438 --> 00:21:36,798
Fuck.

328
00:21:37,158 --> 00:21:38,758
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

329
00:21:45,716 --> 00:21:46,676
That was not cool.

330
00:21:46,796 --> 00:21:48,916
Sarge is just blowing off
a little steam is all.

331
00:21:53,636 --> 00:21:56,356
I never signed up with you
you never signed up with me.

332
00:21:56,756 --> 00:21:58,276
We stick together
because we know.

333
00:21:58,876 --> 00:22:00,196
I take a bullet for you

334
00:22:00,555 --> 00:22:01,755
and you take one for me.

335
00:22:02,594 --> 00:22:04,234
I'd never take a
bullet for anybody.

336
00:22:04,434 --> 00:22:08,434
Sarge, going to this island ain't
like signing up with Uncle Sam.

337
00:22:09,554 --> 00:22:10,874
Maybe it's just ...

338
00:22:12,234 --> 00:22:13,674
... the smart thing to do.

339
00:22:14,314 --> 00:22:15,634
So what's the call?
North or South?

340
00:22:18,553 --> 00:22:19,913
South.

341
00:22:20,553 --> 00:22:22,593
95 to Route 1. Slaughter Beach.

342
00:23:32,465 --> 00:23:33,945
Oh, I got a big one.

343
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,220
What the devil was that?

344
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,620
Someone's coming, Captain.

345
00:24:43,216 --> 00:24:44,416
There's nobody around.

346
00:24:44,856 --> 00:24:46,256
When a place looks this empty...

347
00:24:46,936 --> 00:24:48,136
... probably not empty at all.

348
00:24:48,936 --> 00:24:49,656
Hello, there.

349
00:24:49,936 --> 00:24:51,736
- See what I mean?
- Nice truck.

350
00:24:52,496 --> 00:24:54,096
You got the crown
jewels in there?

351
00:24:54,616 --> 00:24:55,976
Ain't nothing in
here but us.

352
00:24:56,255 --> 00:24:57,495
We found this
truck on the road.

353
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:58,495
Somebody else cleaned it out.

354
00:24:58,815 --> 00:25:00,695
You’re a big old
bull shitter Sarge.

355
00:25:01,095 --> 00:25:02,695
We're looking to get
over to Plum Island.

356
00:25:02,854 --> 00:25:04,414
You've come to the right place.

357
00:25:04,774 --> 00:25:07,694
I can let you have a rowboat
or one with a motor.

358
00:25:07,894 --> 00:25:09,174
How much for the motorboat?

359
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:12,094
- All that you got
- How much for the rowboat?

360
00:25:12,213 --> 00:25:14,013
- All that you got.
- Shit.

361
00:25:14,093 --> 00:25:16,293
This is nothing but an
old fashion stick up.

362
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:18,853
Sucking people in here so
you can take what they got.

363
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:21,453
Things were going pretty
well until you showed up.

364
00:25:21,933 --> 00:25:22,773
Deadheads.

365
00:25:25,852 --> 00:25:29,292
You come out now or we'll
blow your asses all to hell.

366
00:25:29,411 --> 00:25:32,641
As long as we stay in here you
aren't blowing our asses anywhere.

367
00:25:35,931 --> 00:25:37,971
What are we dicking around for,
let's just drive the hell out of here?

368
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:41,451
Don't think about driving out of
here the road is mined with TNT.

369
00:25:41,451 --> 00:25:42,451
Lying fuck.

370
00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:47,209
Might be a fuck
but he wasn't lying.

371
00:25:47,489 --> 00:25:48,849
There's no way out.

372
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:51,449
Yes, there is.

373
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:54,409
We can drive on to that thing.

374
00:25:54,689 --> 00:25:56,009
You just want the money.

375
00:25:56,049 --> 00:25:58,849
I have never been about money,
I have always been about staying alive.

376
00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:01,929
and this tank gives us
a shot at staying alive.

377
00:26:02,008 --> 00:26:04,808
The truck may be our saviour,
but it won't drive on water.

378
00:26:04,887 --> 00:26:06,247
Well someone is going
to swim over there ...

379
00:26:06,247 --> 00:26:07,607
... meaning me, and
start that boat up.

380
00:26:07,887 --> 00:26:09,967
What if it won't start?
What if it's out of gas?

381
00:26:10,087 --> 00:26:13,927
Then we're shit out of luck.
Cisco, back up to the edge of the pier.
I'm going to open the back door.

382
00:26:19,086 --> 00:26:20,406
Cisco, I said back up.

383
00:26:20,526 --> 00:26:21,366
I know how to drive a boat.

384
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:22,446
Do you know how
to drive a boat?

385
00:26:22,685 --> 00:26:23,845
Yes, I can figure it out.

386
00:26:24,085 --> 00:26:25,125
I don't need to figure it out.

387
00:26:25,725 --> 00:26:28,845
Senor, boats they
are like woman.

388
00:26:29,645 --> 00:26:30,805
there isn't one
I can't fire up.

389
00:26:30,885 --> 00:26:33,165
You have a better chance of fucking
that ferry then you do me.

390
00:26:33,204 --> 00:26:36,794
-5 Minutes dear.
- Yeah, yeah you’ll change my life forever.

391
00:26:37,084 --> 00:26:38,364
Cisco, no.

392
00:26:44,283 --> 00:26:45,483
He's swimming out to the ferry.

393
00:26:45,483 --> 00:26:47,173
What would he want
with a ferry boat?

394
00:26:47,243 --> 00:26:49,943
There must be something
worthwhile in that truck.

395
00:26:53,922 --> 00:26:55,002
Shit.

396
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,960
Almost empty I counted

397
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:22,799
I think I'll just hang on to this.

398
00:27:25,718 --> 00:27:27,048
Fuck.

399
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:30,518
Those fucking things must
be standing on the bottom.

400
00:27:51,676 --> 00:27:52,556
Guys.

401
00:27:55,955 --> 00:27:56,935
Guys.

402
00:28:00,035 --> 00:28:01,395
Shit. Get in the truck.

403
00:28:07,634 --> 00:28:09,194
Oh God. Gracias amigo.

404
00:28:11,673 --> 00:28:12,633
He made it, Captain.

405
00:29:05,907 --> 00:29:07,667
Hey there you go.
Hey there you go.

406
00:29:07,947 --> 00:29:08,667
Come on.

407
00:29:26,065 --> 00:29:28,425
- How did you get here?
- Swam, same as you.

408
00:29:29,105 --> 00:29:31,145
And your gun? It's wet, no?

409
00:29:31,384 --> 00:29:32,904
Yeah, you never thought
to try yours did you?

410
00:29:34,504 --> 00:29:35,584
Well you better try it now.

411
00:29:35,904 --> 00:29:37,864
Try it now, Cisco.
What do you expect me
to do all the work?

412
00:29:45,822 --> 00:29:46,822
I never knew.

413
00:29:47,182 --> 00:29:48,422
I thought if a gun was wet.

414
00:29:48,502 --> 00:29:49,822
Only in the cowboy
movies, Poncho.

415
00:29:49,822 --> 00:29:51,702
Now come on, we got to get
this puppy up and running.

416
00:29:56,502 --> 00:29:57,542
Okay.

417
00:30:00,502 --> 00:30:01,622
Okay.

418
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,340
Turn the telegraph full ahead.

419
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,660
- What's a telegraph?
- That thing above my head,
turn it full ahead.

420
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,580
The boats moving, Captain.

421
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,820
Must not have been out of gas.

422
00:30:23,379 --> 00:30:25,499
Move the truck around
Tomboy we're going onboard.

423
00:30:27,978 --> 00:30:28,978
Tomboy.

424
00:30:30,738 --> 00:30:31,818
Where the hell is Tomboy?

425
00:30:33,178 --> 00:30:35,378
How are we going to drive this
onto a boat with nobody driving?

426
00:30:37,177 --> 00:30:37,977
Rainy day kid.

427
00:30:57,095 --> 00:30:59,295
Jesus Christ,
what the fuck was that?

428
00:31:05,814 --> 00:31:08,094
Don't stare at me
start shooting the bastards.

429
00:31:25,971 --> 00:31:26,691
Tawdry.

430
00:31:31,651 --> 00:31:32,251
Got ya!

431
00:31:33,931 --> 00:31:36,211
Ah, you're done mate.

432
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:46,409
Shit.

433
00:32:03,568 --> 00:32:07,428
Well boys, may you get to heaven a few
seconds before the devil knows your dead.

434
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:15,606
Thanks.

435
00:32:33,124 --> 00:32:34,244
Okay, I got you.

436
00:32:34,404 --> 00:32:35,484
Come on.

437
00:32:42,803 --> 00:32:43,923
You're lucky I'm me.

438
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:45,683
The others would have
left you drown.

439
00:32:46,002 --> 00:32:47,562
In that case I am indeed lucky.

440
00:32:47,722 --> 00:32:50,242
- Which way to Plum?
- East, due east.

441
00:32:56,162 --> 00:32:57,522
The man says due east.

442
00:32:58,122 --> 00:33:01,202
Due east? Due east
is the Atlantic Ocean.

443
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,281
Yeah, well, let's hope
there is something in between.

444
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,680
Everything is mouldy.

445
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:15,939
Except these.

446
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:24,999
You remind me of my daughter.

447
00:33:25,678 --> 00:33:27,518
Yeah? Is she out on Plum?

448
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:28,838
Far as I know.

449
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:31,978
Good something for both
of us to look forward to.

450
00:33:32,797 --> 00:33:33,757
Oh, you are ah...

451
00:33:33,757 --> 00:33:34,757
Ah, yeah.

452
00:33:34,917 --> 00:33:35,757
I'm ah ...

453
00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:37,757
- You got a problem with that?
- Not at all, not at all.

454
00:33:39,637 --> 00:33:40,537
You.

455
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:41,917
I can't help you this time.

456
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:45,617
How do ya do,
my name is Patrick O'Flynn.

457
00:33:46,516 --> 00:33:49,076
Back on the dock you would have
killed us as soon as look at us.

458
00:33:49,355 --> 00:33:52,035
Well, you know I am the sorta fella
who always has something up his sleeves.

459
00:33:52,755 --> 00:33:54,595
I could kill you right
now if I wanted to.

460
00:33:55,115 --> 00:33:55,915
I could kill you.

461
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:57,635
Yes you could, yes you could.

462
00:33:58,035 --> 00:34:00,515
I guess it's all about who
pulls the trigger first.

463
00:34:04,554 --> 00:34:05,514
Why do I like you?

464
00:34:06,033 --> 00:34:09,393
Well I've been told by a few
not all that I’m a likeable man.

465
00:34:09,713 --> 00:34:11,273
We are all on the same side.

466
00:34:11,473 --> 00:34:12,553
Those of us living.

467
00:34:12,993 --> 00:34:14,953
- I ain't on your side.
- ah, but you are.

468
00:34:15,193 --> 00:34:16,473
You just don't know it yet.

469
00:34:23,392 --> 00:34:24,272
First things first.

470
00:34:24,912 --> 00:34:28,152
We got to make sure there is no
walking garbage on this scowl.

471
00:34:28,431 --> 00:34:31,151
Careless of you not to have
taken care of it right away.

472
00:34:32,991 --> 00:34:33,631
Heads up.

473
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,190
You want some junk food?

474
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:41,390
Are you okay?

475
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,270
Si, si, for sure.

476
00:34:45,749 --> 00:34:47,509
You didn't get bit while
you were swimming, did you?

477
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:49,229
No, I didn't get bit.

478
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:52,029
In fact, I did some
biting on my own.

479
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,708
One of those things
tried to grab me ...

480
00:34:56,108 --> 00:34:57,868
... and I bit off
one of his fingers.

481
00:34:58,308 --> 00:34:59,268
You swallow any blood?

482
00:34:59,988 --> 00:35:01,068
No, I don't thinks so.

483
00:35:01,908 --> 00:35:03,148
There was a lot
of water yeah, but ...

484
00:35:03,628 --> 00:35:07,188
... blood, I don't think so.

485
00:35:07,506 --> 00:35:08,706
Tomboy, get your ass down here.

486
00:35:09,386 --> 00:35:10,946
Bring the licorice sticks.

487
00:35:41,023 --> 00:35:42,103
Most of them got out.

488
00:35:51,102 --> 00:35:52,782
This one got out
a different way.

489
00:35:53,382 --> 00:35:54,482
Got one here.

490
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:24,739
They're getting smart.

491
00:36:24,979 --> 00:36:25,579
Smart?

492
00:36:25,858 --> 00:36:27,498
That thing remembered
how to start his car.

493
00:36:27,577 --> 00:36:29,537
Yeah, but he will never
pass his driving test.

494
00:36:32,717 --> 00:36:34,957
I think we got it all cleaned up.

495
00:36:42,937 --> 00:36:43,977
Thanks a lot for your help.

496
00:36:46,615 --> 00:36:49,735
I guess there is no profit
in knocking off dead people?

497
00:36:53,015 --> 00:36:55,495
This ah, island
you been selling.

498
00:36:55,695 --> 00:36:56,535
Many out there?

499
00:36:56,935 --> 00:36:59,655
It is. it's a lovely spot.

500
00:36:59,814 --> 00:37:00,774
Lovely spot.

501
00:37:01,974 --> 00:37:03,934
But I am no longer welcome.

502
00:37:04,574 --> 00:37:05,414
Why? What did you do?

503
00:37:05,494 --> 00:37:07,214
Nothing to deserve what I got.

504
00:37:10,093 --> 00:37:11,973
Yeah sure I am a bandit
and now I am a thief.

505
00:37:13,213 --> 00:37:16,893
Not so bad these days when there is
nothing but thieves some of them

506
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:20,592
are drawing down big salaries for
just being clever at their craft.

507
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:22,812
Me, I never drew a salary.

508
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,292
I always relied on how many
fish wandered in to me net.

509
00:37:27,691 --> 00:37:29,531
Now you cast your
net on the Internet.

510
00:37:30,811 --> 00:37:32,371
Lot of fish in them waters.

511
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:40,890
I just can't believe we are
taking a gamble on some guy who
lies easier than a bed sheet.

512
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:41,970
Land, ho.

513
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:45,930
Drop anchor.

514
00:37:46,129 --> 00:37:47,849
Drop anchor out here?
I thought we were going ashore?

515
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:51,129
Not with this barge there's
no deep water harbours on Plum.

516
00:37:52,168 --> 00:37:54,508
We'll take the dingy
it will be better.

517
00:37:54,888 --> 00:37:56,388
Nobody will see us coming.

518
00:38:16,806 --> 00:38:18,466
Shit.

519
00:38:52,921 --> 00:38:53,981
What did I do?

520
00:38:54,361 --> 00:38:55,001
We should go.

521
00:38:55,081 --> 00:38:56,361
We can just make
it before daylight.

522
00:39:02,161 --> 00:39:03,481
Stick it in here like this.

523
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:05,241
What are we in for?

524
00:39:05,721 --> 00:39:07,601
Folks will want to be
left to their own way.

525
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,560
They don't like strangers.

526
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:11,279
You're not a stranger.

527
00:39:11,399 --> 00:39:13,319
Oh some think of me
as worse I'm sure.

528
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:14,599
Especially now.

529
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:20,119
You see an unusual number of
strangers have been landing
on Plum the last few weeks.

530
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:21,599
on boats they got from me.

531
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,979
Your pitch on the net
why did you do it?

532
00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:27,119
To annoy a certain gentleman
who thinks he owns this rock.

533
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,317
And believe it or not, to help people
to find a better place to live.

534
00:39:30,877 --> 00:39:32,637
So what happened between
you and this gentleman?

535
00:39:34,037 --> 00:39:35,917
We had a little disagreement...

536
00:39:36,677 --> 00:39:40,577
...about whether or not to
expand the island cemetery

537
00:39:48,475 --> 00:39:49,475
Pussyfoot.

538
00:39:49,915 --> 00:39:52,155
Hey, I'm keeping up
with you old man.

539
00:39:52,595 --> 00:39:54,475
No not you, that's
the name of the River.

540
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,675
Pussyfoot cause it's a
pussy of a river.

541
00:39:57,154 --> 00:39:59,594
This side has always
belonged to the O'Flynns

542
00:39:59,754 --> 00:40:00,594
The other side...

543
00:40:01,154 --> 00:40:04,474
...Well, I'm sure you be meeting
some folks from the other side...soon.

544
00:40:07,993 --> 00:40:09,953
This here's the back
way over to my spread.

545
00:40:11,073 --> 00:40:12,913
I'm hoping my
daughter will be there.

546
00:40:12,915 --> 00:40:16,352
I had a bit of a disagreement
with her before we left.

547
00:40:17,032 --> 00:40:18,392
But she's still an O'Flynn.

548
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:20,392
It seems like you been having
disagreements with everybody.

549
00:40:21,632 --> 00:40:22,512
Hey.

550
00:40:23,192 --> 00:40:25,472
When a place looks this empty it's
probably not empty at all, right?

551
00:40:28,111 --> 00:40:29,111
See what I mean?

552
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:32,790
Mailman is all.

553
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,990
There hasn't been
any mail for days.

554
00:40:47,068 --> 00:40:47,968
Look.

555
00:40:52,788 --> 00:40:53,808
And over there.

556
00:40:55,028 --> 00:40:56,228
See what happens?

557
00:40:56,508 --> 00:40:58,148
Keep them with you, he says.

558
00:40:58,548 --> 00:41:00,388
Except their not really
with yeah are they?

559
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:02,348
Not when you have
to keep them in chains.

560
00:41:02,687 --> 00:41:04,547
Who’s keeping them in chains?

561
00:41:04,747 --> 00:41:06,227
They've seen us give me a gun.

562
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:10,146
Never could shoot
straight the bastards.

563
00:41:12,786 --> 00:41:13,706
What bastards?

564
00:41:13,786 --> 00:41:15,986
- The ones shooting at us
- The Muldoons.

565
00:41:20,505 --> 00:41:21,985
I think there is only
one of them out there.

566
00:41:22,825 --> 00:41:23,665
Kenny get down.

567
00:41:24,145 --> 00:41:25,465
Oh, God.

568
00:41:29,424 --> 00:41:30,064
I got 'em.

569
00:41:30,504 --> 00:41:31,424
Crap.

570
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:41,343
You said you would never
take a bullet for anybody

571
00:41:42,863 --> 00:41:44,543
You’re just what I
always said you were.

572
00:41:47,143 --> 00:41:50,463
A big old bull shitter.
So there.

573
00:41:59,121 --> 00:41:59,981
Kenny.

574
00:42:02,861 --> 00:42:03,221
Hey.

575
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,580
Shit, Kenny.

576
00:42:07,419 --> 00:42:08,499
No, no.

577
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:13,099
Why did I bring you with me?

578
00:42:15,259 --> 00:42:16,579
I'm so sorry, buddy.

579
00:42:17,019 --> 00:42:17,979
I'm sorry.

580
00:42:18,859 --> 00:42:21,459
Why did I bring you with me?

581
00:42:22,698 --> 00:42:23,378
Fuck

582
00:42:27,338 --> 00:42:29,658
I had to do it, you know I did.

583
00:42:29,657 --> 00:42:31,097
You fucker.

584
00:42:44,856 --> 00:42:47,216
- She is beautiful.
- She's dead.

585
00:42:47,735 --> 00:42:48,455
She's my daughter.

586
00:42:50,535 --> 00:42:51,995
She's your daughter?

587
00:42:52,135 --> 00:42:52,995
She was.

588
00:42:53,734 --> 00:42:54,974
Will you let me up, please?

589
00:43:04,814 --> 00:43:05,894
Hey, you okay?

590
00:43:06,654 --> 00:43:09,134
Of course I'm not okay?
I'm shot, for Christ sakes.

591
00:43:10,972 --> 00:43:13,012
Given the fact that you've
been shot are you okay?

592
00:43:13,052 --> 00:43:14,012
Yeah, I'll live.

593
00:43:14,612 --> 00:43:15,752
Mother of God.

594
00:43:15,772 --> 00:43:16,972
On me own property.

595
00:43:18,772 --> 00:43:19,732
All of this...

596
00:43:21,172 --> 00:43:22,292
...used to be mine.

597
00:43:24,292 --> 00:43:25,572
The land around us,

598
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:27,911
the pond below.

599
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:31,250
and whatever was swimming in it.

600
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:33,990
Look what's swimming in it now.

601
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:37,970
There's a lot of them.

602
00:43:44,449 --> 00:43:47,989
These people didn't get chewed
on by deadheads, they've been shot.

603
00:43:51,048 --> 00:43:52,528
Her mother knitted that for her.

604
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,608
She begged me not
to take it from her.

605
00:43:54,688 --> 00:43:57,008
After I robbed her purse
of the last $30 in it.

606
00:43:58,267 --> 00:44:00,367
I put her on a boat
to come over here.

607
00:44:03,167 --> 00:44:04,907
I never meant for them to die.

608
00:44:10,926 --> 00:44:11,746
Bastard.

609
00:44:11,886 --> 00:44:14,046
Shooting the living
and sparing the dead

610
00:44:14,165 --> 00:44:14,605
That bastard.

611
00:44:14,765 --> 00:44:17,485
What bastard?
Who is this guy?

612
00:44:18,565 --> 00:44:19,845
Seamus Muldoon.

613
00:44:20,445 --> 00:44:22,925
We've been chewing on each other
ever since the schoolyard

614
00:44:24,325 --> 00:44:26,325
Will one of yeah give me some
more bullets for this gun?

615
00:44:26,565 --> 00:44:27,405
What are you going to do?

616
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:29,365
I'm going to go shoot
that son of a bitch.

617
00:44:31,803 --> 00:44:32,903
Not if I get there first.

618
00:44:34,243 --> 00:44:36,183
My best friend is
lying there dead.

619
00:44:36,203 --> 00:44:38,563
My shoulder feels
like it's on fire

620
00:44:38,563 --> 00:44:41,683
and there is a bunch of innocent people
that somebody decided to use for fish food.

621
00:44:41,843 --> 00:44:44,963
Now if this somebody is this Muldoon
guy you have been talking about...

622
00:44:46,282 --> 00:44:47,902
... I want a piece of him.

623
00:44:49,121 --> 00:44:50,641
I knew we would be
on the same side.

624
00:44:50,841 --> 00:44:51,681
Sooner or later.

625
00:44:51,961 --> 00:44:53,681
I'll go round up
some of my kin folk.

626
00:44:53,841 --> 00:44:54,601
We'll go with you.

627
00:44:54,641 --> 00:44:55,761
No, I know all the back ways.

628
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:58,321
and five might get seen
where one wouldn't.

629
00:44:58,841 --> 00:45:01,481
No there is an old meeting hall
up the road, half a mile.

630
00:45:01,921 --> 00:45:04,561
You wait there; I'll turn up
just after nightfall.

631
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,160
Oh, the bullets.

632
00:45:09,439 --> 00:45:10,599
Let's get our stuff.

633
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:11,639
Right.

634
00:45:13,479 --> 00:45:14,679
Sorry about your daughter.

635
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:16,919
Hurry off now.

636
00:45:41,316 --> 00:45:41,956
Seamus.

637
00:45:43,196 --> 00:45:48,976
Lem, Christ. What are you doing sneaking
up like a coon raiding the garbage?

638
00:45:49,275 --> 00:45:50,715
I wasn't sneaking, Seamus.

639
00:45:52,074 --> 00:45:53,154
Mr. Chuck sent me.

640
00:45:53,234 --> 00:45:55,594
He says it's still no damn good
you got to come have a look.

641
00:45:55,954 --> 00:46:02,074
Sweet Jesus what's a man got to do get
a moments peace on this God forsaken rock?

642
00:46:22,552 --> 00:46:23,512
Chuck, you in here?

643
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:25,631
Where the fuck else
do you think I'd be?

644
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:30,151
Lem tells me you are having
some kind a problems in here.

645
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:33,390
Well yeah, trying to keep these
God damn deadheads from eating me.

646
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:38,910
So know more than usual.

647
00:46:39,269 --> 00:46:40,189
No sir.

648
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:52,828
Not my hat.

649
00:46:58,547 --> 00:46:59,147
Dammit.

650
00:47:06,227 --> 00:47:08,427
No more than usual.

651
00:47:19,985 --> 00:47:21,745
Ain't that old Timothy's boy?

652
00:47:22,385 --> 00:47:23,265
Timothy Scanlon.

653
00:47:24,105 --> 00:47:25,345
How long has he been in there?

654
00:47:27,384 --> 00:47:28,344
This is his third day.

655
00:47:28,664 --> 00:47:30,544
Must be getting hungry by now.

656
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:32,063
Put your hand near him
and he'll bite it off.

657
00:47:32,383 --> 00:47:35,883
Dumb fucks in the barn chewing on
their hands cause it smells like a man.

658
00:47:35,903 --> 00:47:39,143
But we haven't had a dumb fuck yet
try to take a bite out of that pig.

659
00:47:39,183 --> 00:47:41,543
Well maybe they don't like pig.

660
00:47:45,542 --> 00:47:48,102
Sir, no disrespect but...

661
00:47:48,182 --> 00:47:50,822
...we set out trying to
keep these deadheads alive

662
00:47:50,825 --> 00:47:54,221
and lately we been shooting
them down like they is mad dogs.

663
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:56,381
Those that don't show promise.

664
00:47:57,101 --> 00:47:58,941
What about those people
over in the marsh?

665
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,580
Strangers, no kin of mine.

666
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:07,620
Now we got an obligation to protect
ourselves and what's ours.

667
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:10,940
- Protect what's yours,
- what's mine is everybody's.

668
00:48:11,419 --> 00:48:15,019
I provide the bread and
butter for people here.

669
00:48:16,698 --> 00:48:19,618
I figure you would be the last person
to question me on that Chuck.

670
00:48:20,618 --> 00:48:23,458
I took you in when you
was running from the law

671
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:26,218
I let you work your way
into a place of respect.

672
00:48:26,418 --> 00:48:28,738
I let you work this
ranch like it was yours.

673
00:48:28,778 --> 00:48:29,578
It's not mine.

674
00:48:30,097 --> 00:48:31,097
It's not is it?

675
00:48:31,656 --> 00:48:33,376
I mean with everything you've done.

676
00:48:33,496 --> 00:48:36,816
It might seem more than fair when
all I had to do is tend to the livestock.

677
00:48:37,576 --> 00:48:39,896
But that's when the livestock
was livestock.

678
00:48:40,736 --> 00:48:42,776
Are you still on
my payroll, Chuck?

679
00:48:43,736 --> 00:48:45,296
or are you walking on me?

680
00:48:46,376 --> 00:48:47,336
No one else is hiring.

681
00:48:50,854 --> 00:48:54,774
Lem, bury the Scanlon boy
and bring home the pig.

682
00:48:55,174 --> 00:48:56,374
It will make a tasty supper

683
00:48:56,974 --> 00:48:59,494
and go out with Chuck
rope another deadhead

684
00:48:59,494 --> 00:49:01,694
and not one of those dumb
fucks in your barn either.

685
00:49:01,894 --> 00:49:03,054
Their all dumb fucks.

686
00:49:03,773 --> 00:49:05,413
Man dies and he gets stupid.

687
00:49:06,053 --> 00:49:08,413
Well I got a dead woman in mind.

688
00:49:08,693 --> 00:49:14,393
One that's smart enough to go
riding around this island like
she's still got a heartbeat.

689
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:16,452
You mean Patrick O'Flynns girl.

690
00:49:16,612 --> 00:49:19,852
We got to get these things to learn
to eat something other than us.

691
00:49:20,451 --> 00:49:21,731
She might be the one, Chuck.

692
00:49:22,211 --> 00:49:23,691
She just might be the one.

693
00:49:41,409 --> 00:49:42,929
You were sweet on
her weren’t yeah?

694
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:46,209
Yeah, well it wouldn't
a worked out.

695
00:49:46,929 --> 00:49:48,669
Seems like nothing ever does.

696
00:50:19,525 --> 00:50:22,365
Vinyl. Gag me.

697
00:50:24,084 --> 00:50:24,724
Hey.

698
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:27,604
Medicine?

699
00:50:29,923 --> 00:50:30,963
Thanks.

700
00:50:32,003 --> 00:50:33,963
I got a needle and thread
you want me to sew that up?

701
00:50:35,403 --> 00:50:36,563
Sewing is women's works.

702
00:50:38,403 --> 00:50:41,403
- You're an asshole.
- I told you I'm fine?

703
00:50:42,282 --> 00:50:43,282
Stubborn asshole.

704
00:50:44,602 --> 00:50:45,602
Cisco?

705
00:50:49,882 --> 00:50:50,962
Cisco?

706
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,480
Cisco?

707
00:51:13,478 --> 00:51:14,558
Cisco?

708
00:51:24,158 --> 00:51:28,678
Forget low tech,
this place is no tech.

709
00:51:29,717 --> 00:51:30,917
I don't know, man.

710
00:51:32,036 --> 00:51:33,596
I don't know what we got
ourselves into out here.

711
00:51:35,636 --> 00:51:36,276
Dalmatian

712
00:51:36,436 --> 00:51:37,156
Damnation?

713
00:51:37,156 --> 00:51:38,196
Dalmatian

714
00:51:38,676 --> 00:51:39,916
Town I was born in.

715
00:51:40,476 --> 00:51:43,396
Way down in the ass
crack of Alabama.

716
00:51:44,755 --> 00:51:45,835
It was small.

717
00:51:46,475 --> 00:51:49,595
Nobody from the outside
ever came sniffing around...

718
00:51:50,075 --> 00:51:54,395
...folks on the inside always
wanted to know your business
every minute of the day.

719
00:51:55,394 --> 00:51:58,194
Town was there 6 years before
they decided to call it something.

720
00:51:58,634 --> 00:52:03,354
When they couldn't think of anything better
they named it after the Fire Chiefs dog.

721
00:52:03,473 --> 00:52:05,073
I like small towns but

722
00:52:06,793 --> 00:52:08,793
small towns give
birth to small people.

723
00:52:09,753 --> 00:52:11,813
But you're not a small person.

724
00:52:13,192 --> 00:52:15,272
What are you like 6.2", 6.3"?

725
00:52:17,111 --> 00:52:19,931
6.1" last time I measured.

726
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:22,691
I don't think I'm
full grown yet.

727
00:52:23,111 --> 00:52:24,111
Who knows?

728
00:52:24,871 --> 00:52:26,631
Might even end
up taller than you.

729
00:52:28,711 --> 00:52:29,671
You might kid

730
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:34,829
Whenever you get
to be full grown.

731
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:50,388
Whoa, whoa it's me.

732
00:52:54,347 --> 00:52:55,667
Cisco, Jesus.

733
00:52:55,827 --> 00:52:56,987
Leave me alone.

734
00:53:02,187 --> 00:53:03,667
- Cisco.
- Leave me alone.

735
00:53:10,546 --> 00:53:12,786
It's beautiful, no?

736
00:53:14,105 --> 00:53:15,665
It is a beautiful place to live.

737
00:53:16,625 --> 00:53:17,985
and to die.

738
00:53:21,304 --> 00:53:23,944
You know what is
happening to me?

739
00:53:24,944 --> 00:53:25,784
Yeah.

740
00:53:25,824 --> 00:53:27,944
Then go back to the others.

741
00:53:29,424 --> 00:53:30,684
Tell them I say goodbye.

742
00:53:30,723 --> 00:53:31,923
No way, Cisco.

743
00:53:35,903 --> 00:53:37,983
Okay, if you want to watch.

744
00:53:38,302 --> 00:53:39,202
No.

745
00:53:39,502 --> 00:53:40,622
Jesus.

746
00:53:42,182 --> 00:53:43,422
You don't kill yourself.

747
00:53:43,582 --> 00:53:45,122
If you kill yourself,
you burn in hell.

748
00:53:45,262 --> 00:53:47,902
That's one thing your
God doesn't forgive.

749
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:58,960
Finally did it, Cisco.

750
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:04,580
Finally changed
my life forever.

751
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:13,858
I'll never forget you.

752
00:54:20,818 --> 00:54:21,698
Who the hell are you?

753
00:54:22,018 --> 00:54:22,978
Who the hell are you?

754
00:54:25,337 --> 00:54:26,137
It doesn't matter who I am.

755
00:54:26,777 --> 00:54:30,977
There's only one man around here
who matters and I got a feeling
he is gonna want to meet you.

756
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:31,997
Lem.

757
00:54:32,016 --> 00:54:32,936
Come on.

758
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:33,456
No.

759
00:54:34,296 --> 00:54:36,416
No, fuck you.

760
00:54:43,495 --> 00:54:44,255
Are you okay?

761
00:54:47,455 --> 00:54:49,255
I think I need to
check the shoulder out.

762
00:54:49,455 --> 00:54:52,375
There's a first aid kit
in that knapsack there.

763
00:54:59,253 --> 00:55:00,893
I'm going to pass out.

764
00:55:02,653 --> 00:55:03,873
Shit.

765
00:55:05,173 --> 00:55:08,253
okay..ah...okay

766
00:55:10,133 --> 00:55:11,313
Fuck.

767
00:55:18,531 --> 00:55:19,371
Okay.

768
00:55:25,331 --> 00:55:26,291
Shit.

769
00:55:27,131 --> 00:55:28,271
You forgot your gun.

770
00:55:28,691 --> 00:55:30,831
You're an idiot.

771
00:55:31,449 --> 00:55:32,629
Too loud.

772
00:56:12,965 --> 00:56:13,985
Oh, Jesus.

773
00:56:19,404 --> 00:56:20,084
Patrick.

774
00:56:20,964 --> 00:56:22,564
I brought William and my boy.

775
00:56:23,884 --> 00:56:27,644
We been putting them down just
like you said we should have
done from the start.

776
00:56:27,804 --> 00:56:31,484
My Susan had to
put her down too.

777
00:56:31,564 --> 00:56:32,544
It's been bad.

778
00:56:33,643 --> 00:56:34,903
Thank you for coming.

779
00:56:39,322 --> 00:56:40,262
Help!

780
00:56:43,562 --> 00:56:44,802
Bastards.

781
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:11,579
She's not eating with us?

782
00:57:11,659 --> 00:57:13,399
Women and children
have their place.

783
00:57:14,358 --> 00:57:15,918
Children quiet in their bed ...

784
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:17,958
... and women in the kitchen.

785
00:57:19,078 --> 00:57:20,778
Some women might
disagree with that.

786
00:57:20,898 --> 00:57:22,198
How did you get over here?

787
00:57:23,237 --> 00:57:24,137
Boat.

788
00:57:24,217 --> 00:57:25,437
Did you come alone?

789
00:57:26,037 --> 00:57:27,157
Yeah, yeah.

790
00:57:27,217 --> 00:57:28,197
Well, that's funny.

791
00:57:28,877 --> 00:57:33,597
Because two of my ranch hands
were over at the other side of
Pussyfoot this morning.

792
00:57:33,956 --> 00:57:35,576
Only one came back.

793
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:39,296
Told me he got into
a bit of fracas with...

794
00:57:39,475 --> 00:57:40,875
...6 strangers.

795
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:41,635
One was a kid,

796
00:57:41,645 --> 00:57:43,575
4 were dressed like you

797
00:57:43,655 --> 00:57:47,955
number 6 was Patrick O'Flynn.

798
00:57:53,354 --> 00:58:00,474
I'm sure the old bastard filled
your head with all sorts of
bad thoughts about me and mine.

799
00:58:00,573 --> 00:58:03,113
Well, I was born a Muldoon.

800
00:58:04,993 --> 00:58:07,993
At school, my teacher
was a Muldoon.

801
00:58:08,793 --> 00:58:11,573
The good man who tought
me ranching was a Muldoon.

802
00:58:11,792 --> 00:58:15,532
My priest, I was named after
him, Father Seamus Muldoon.

803
00:58:15,671 --> 00:58:20,111
You might notice that all the folks
in these pictures look a bit poorly.

804
00:58:20,131 --> 00:58:23,551
That's because all the pictures
were taken after they died.

805
00:58:24,431 --> 00:58:27,991
We felt the need
to keep them with us.

806
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:30,790
Just like I'm trying to do now.

807
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:36,610
Those that have fallen all of
them, all I'm praying for ...

808
00:58:36,829 --> 00:58:39,469
... is to keep them with us.

809
00:58:41,549 --> 00:58:46,669
All my life I stuck to
the Good Lord's word.

810
00:58:48,428 --> 00:58:50,668
They is his practices.

811
00:58:54,747 --> 00:58:59,227
All I'm doing is
what he commanded of us.

812
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:23,704
I'm going to try
to convince you...

813
00:59:25,304 --> 00:59:27,964
to help me to do
the Lord's bidding.

814
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:03,900
All right, it's all right.

815
01:00:05,499 --> 01:00:07,299
I got you, I got you.

816
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:09,139
Come here.

817
01:00:09,259 --> 01:00:10,259
It's all right.

818
01:00:10,419 --> 01:00:11,459
It's all right, baby.

819
01:00:11,819 --> 01:00:12,579
All right.

820
01:00:14,698 --> 01:00:15,578
It's me, Jenny.

821
01:00:16,018 --> 01:00:16,698
It's me.

822
01:00:19,217 --> 01:00:19,937
It's me.

823
01:00:23,137 --> 01:00:23,817
Boys!

824
01:00:24,217 --> 01:00:25,617
Boys, get her out of here.

825
01:00:26,337 --> 01:00:27,497
Get her out of here.

826
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:38,695
You're dreaming.

827
01:00:42,335 --> 01:00:43,815
Wake up.

828
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:47,995
I’m sorry, she's.

829
01:00:49,255 --> 01:00:50,995
You need to wake up.

830
01:00:53,014 --> 01:00:54,474
There's two of them.

831
01:00:55,973 --> 01:00:57,813
I have a twin sister.

832
01:00:59,173 --> 01:01:03,893
Janet and Jane, the two Janes
they used to call us no one
could ever tell us apart.

833
01:01:04,213 --> 01:01:07,973
Of course it should be
easier now that Jane is dead.

834
01:01:12,452 --> 01:01:13,952
An where is he now?

835
01:01:14,291 --> 01:01:15,171
My father.

836
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,371
He took off.

837
01:01:16,531 --> 01:01:17,591
A while ago.

838
01:01:17,671 --> 01:01:18,851
To do what?

839
01:01:19,171 --> 01:01:20,571
To run up some old friends.

840
01:01:20,751 --> 01:01:21,911
Lord save us.

841
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:26,950
What happened to
Cisco and a Tomboy?

842
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:27,990
Don't know.

843
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:29,250
I haven't seen them since...

844
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:30,970
My father is a liar.

845
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:33,610
Maybe not a liar.

846
01:01:33,611 --> 01:01:37,629
But my father sees the world one
way and so does Seamus Muldoon.

847
01:01:37,809 --> 01:01:41,129
Both of them about as spite full a
pair of fools as the Lord ever made.

848
01:01:41,648 --> 01:01:43,088
Well, I'm siding
with your old man.

849
01:01:43,728 --> 01:01:44,488
Why?

850
01:01:46,008 --> 01:01:47,508
I got my reasons,

851
01:01:47,728 --> 01:01:48,948
you got one too?

852
01:01:49,368 --> 01:01:50,728
- What reasons?
- he's your father.

853
01:01:50,888 --> 01:01:53,768
Never, he was never
a proper father

854
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:56,487
and now he's back and with
you and your guns with him

855
01:01:56,489 --> 01:01:59,046
and he is about to
start World War III.

856
01:01:59,046 --> 01:02:00,446
Hello, daughter.

857
01:02:02,646 --> 01:02:03,526
Hello, Dad.

858
01:02:04,206 --> 01:02:05,646
You don't have to come with us.

859
01:02:07,126 --> 01:02:08,286
It's never been your fight.

860
01:02:13,564 --> 01:02:14,204
Let's go.

861
01:02:14,644 --> 01:02:15,404
Right now?

862
01:02:15,484 --> 01:02:16,484
Right now.

863
01:02:16,804 --> 01:02:19,444
- We're waiting for Cisco.
- and Tomboy.

864
01:02:19,844 --> 01:02:20,844
Muldoon's got her.

865
01:02:21,684 --> 01:02:24,804
Can't be sure but it's a good bet
his got that Mexican too.

866
01:02:26,164 --> 01:02:27,864
Are you sure you’re
okay to do this?

867
01:02:28,683 --> 01:02:31,943
Done worse and done
more kid, let's go.

868
01:02:33,602 --> 01:02:34,082
Dad.

869
01:02:36,282 --> 01:02:37,922
She's really a babe, huh?

870
01:02:38,682 --> 01:02:40,002
You're too young
and I'm too old.

871
01:02:40,002 --> 01:02:41,202
She's got issues, kid.

872
01:02:41,762 --> 01:02:43,562
- We'll see.
- Dad, please.

873
01:02:43,761 --> 01:02:44,641
Go back Janet.

874
01:02:44,721 --> 01:02:47,521
You can't kill him. He is the only
reason why you are still alive.

875
01:02:47,561 --> 01:02:48,481
What?

876
01:02:49,681 --> 01:02:51,441
I'll catch up with you. James.

877
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,839
I always wondered.

878
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:08,319
Why he didn't shoot me that
night when he had the chance?

879
01:03:08,349 --> 01:03:09,319
It was you.

880
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:10,719
You talked him out of it.

881
01:03:10,919 --> 01:03:11,999
And for what?

882
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:15,679
Now you're going to die
anyway and so is he.

883
01:03:15,997 --> 01:03:20,877
Seamus Muldoon is spit on the
floor that needs to be mopped up.

884
01:03:20,917 --> 01:03:24,517
I mopped your spit off the
floor a hundred times.

885
01:03:24,797 --> 01:03:28,157
And I dug the furrows and
I chopped the wood and I...

886
01:03:28,157 --> 01:03:32,637
I buried your wife when
you were nowhere to be seen.

887
01:03:33,036 --> 01:03:38,976
And all the while it was Jane; always
Jane was the one that was in your heart.

888
01:03:39,035 --> 01:03:43,935
She and you were the only children
in the house and me the only grown up.

889
01:03:44,795 --> 01:03:49,195
Listen to yourself; you're
stubborn and wilful as I am.

890
01:03:49,994 --> 01:03:51,834
Of course I loved Jane.

891
01:03:52,474 --> 01:03:54,314
But I loved you just as much.

892
01:03:54,833 --> 01:03:58,753
Or more, because
you were another me.

893
01:04:01,273 --> 01:04:02,473
Back to the house, Janet.

894
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:05,853
See you there later, or not.

895
01:04:20,071 --> 01:04:22,611
What are we stopping here for?
Let's cross the bridge.

896
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:24,510
I got a feeling.

897
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:27,830
We should be crossing the old
Pussyfoot somewhere else.

898
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:32,230
You're going to cross
right here, Patrick.

899
01:04:34,429 --> 01:04:35,469
Get out of here, kid.

900
01:04:35,509 --> 01:04:38,969
Go back to the boat, take the
money out of the safe and go live.

901
01:04:42,948 --> 01:04:44,608
Looking for this?

902
01:04:46,628 --> 01:04:48,448
Now get out of here.

903
01:05:05,586 --> 01:05:07,346
Don't be shooting them, boys.

904
01:05:07,426 --> 01:05:11,306
They get shot, they drop
that pole and she's meat.

905
01:05:11,425 --> 01:05:13,905
I'll pop the deadheads then
we can pop the rest of them.

906
01:05:13,985 --> 01:05:16,525
Yeah and Muldoon
pops your friend.

907
01:05:16,664 --> 01:05:17,684
No.

908
01:05:18,104 --> 01:05:19,464
I owe something to that girl.

909
01:05:25,023 --> 01:05:26,923
Lay down your guns, boys.

910
01:05:33,543 --> 01:05:35,203
You're lucky I'm me.

911
01:05:36,902 --> 01:05:38,222
Come across the bridge.

912
01:05:38,422 --> 01:05:41,662
All of you.
Leave your guns behind.

913
01:05:51,701 --> 01:05:53,901
Bring them all
to Chuck's place.

914
01:06:11,739 --> 01:06:13,019
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah

915
01:06:13,258 --> 01:06:16,978
- Where's Cisco?
- He's in Heaven.

916
01:06:17,217 --> 01:06:19,257
Telling the Virgin Mary
he can change her life.

917
01:06:19,297 --> 01:06:21,137
This might interest
you. Patrick.

918
01:06:21,257 --> 01:06:22,657
Look in the corral there.

919
01:06:27,137 --> 01:06:29,577
We tried this with
a lot of the deadheads.

920
01:06:30,176 --> 01:06:31,056
Dear Lord.

921
01:06:31,056 --> 01:06:33,736
We tried to feed them
rabbits, squirrels, pigs.

922
01:06:34,256 --> 01:06:36,536
This time we're gonna
try something bigger.

923
01:06:37,175 --> 01:06:39,375
Since it's your dame
in there, Patrick

924
01:06:39,735 --> 01:06:41,495
I figure you might better
understand what

925
01:06:41,495 --> 01:06:42,975
I've been trying to do.

926
01:06:43,735 --> 01:06:45,975
Trying to keep
the fallen with us.

927
01:06:46,214 --> 01:06:51,334
Can't ever do that unless we can get
them to eat something that ain't human.

928
01:06:51,614 --> 01:06:52,654
It's important ...

929
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:56,254
... not just for us
but the rest of the world.

930
01:06:56,493 --> 01:07:00,973
God is going to send us all
to hell and the devil will
surely send us back again.

931
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:03,213
if we don't do the right thing.

932
01:07:03,612 --> 01:07:07,132
Chuck, let the others
out of the stables.

933
01:07:07,372 --> 01:07:08,892
Let them see what's going on.

934
01:07:09,132 --> 01:07:11,172
Who knows? Maybe they'll
learn something.

935
01:07:14,012 --> 01:07:14,952
Boys.

936
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:21,950
Oh, Christ.

937
01:07:34,929 --> 01:07:36,909
I'll make you a deal, Patrick.

938
01:07:37,128 --> 01:07:39,928
If your daughter here takes
a bite out of that animal.

939
01:07:39,938 --> 01:07:42,248
You'll admit that I've
been right all along.

940
01:07:42,488 --> 01:07:43,928
That's all I ever wanted.

941
01:07:44,248 --> 01:07:46,928
It's for you to
admit that I'm right ...

942
01:07:47,208 --> 01:07:48,208
.. and you're wrong.

943
01:07:48,808 --> 01:07:54,268
You do that much and you and
your boys here are free to go.

944
01:07:54,927 --> 01:07:56,927
Thanks for the offer, Seamus,

945
01:07:58,406 --> 01:07:59,946
but see I can't go.

946
01:08:01,326 --> 01:08:03,846
Not with business undone

947
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:05,306
What business?

948
01:08:05,405 --> 01:08:06,945
Well, for one thing...

949
01:08:07,225 --> 01:08:09,225
... I ain't killed you yet.

950
01:08:11,365 --> 01:08:12,965
I'm feeling a little differently.

951
01:08:14,245 --> 01:08:15,565
Well, then.

952
01:08:15,924 --> 01:08:22,924
Well then we'll just settle
in here and see what happens.

953
01:08:59,239 --> 01:09:01,679
What would you do with
one million dollars?

954
01:09:19,037 --> 01:09:22,277
My sister is never gonna
do nothing to hurt that horse.

955
01:09:28,516 --> 01:09:29,536
What can we do?

956
01:09:30,116 --> 01:09:32,776
I brought that up
from where you left it.

957
01:09:33,196 --> 01:09:34,976
Thought you didn't
want to start a war.

958
01:09:35,036 --> 01:09:37,936
I don't, I'm just
trying to even the odds.

959
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:40,835
What's going on up there?

960
01:09:41,195 --> 01:09:42,655
It's me, Chuck.

961
01:09:47,794 --> 01:09:49,534
I've brought them
back the guns.

962
01:09:50,394 --> 01:09:51,954
Well did you now?

963
01:09:52,074 --> 01:09:54,374
Now, you all have guns.

964
01:09:54,674 --> 01:09:57,794
First one to pull the trigger is
gonna cause a whole lotta bleeding.

965
01:09:57,813 --> 01:09:59,913
- Likely so.
- Let them go.

966
01:10:00,032 --> 01:10:00,552
No.

967
01:10:02,152 --> 01:10:03,312
I won't go.

968
01:10:04,832 --> 01:10:09,112
Seems like your daddy is bound and
determined to stick it to me.

969
01:10:09,392 --> 01:10:12,712
Just like I'm bound and
determined to stick it to him.

970
01:10:12,952 --> 01:10:14,892
You won't be sticking
it to anybody

971
01:10:14,991 --> 01:10:16,591
not when we're
through with ya.

972
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:26,390
Hey.

973
01:10:27,070 --> 01:10:30,450
All you guys got are a bunch
of rusty old pea shooters.

974
01:10:30,789 --> 01:10:31,949
Well we got this.

975
01:10:33,989 --> 01:10:34,629
Fuck.

976
01:10:37,148 --> 01:10:39,988
Well, Mr. Muldoon

977
01:10:41,988 --> 01:10:44,408
Looks like someone
else is hiring.

978
01:10:47,227 --> 01:10:48,287
Chuck.

979
01:10:49,747 --> 01:10:51,307
Chuck, where the
hell are you going?

980
01:10:52,267 --> 01:10:54,367
Nobody walks out on me.

981
01:11:02,545 --> 01:11:03,665
Look like she wants something.

982
01:11:04,985 --> 01:11:05,865
Me.

983
01:11:07,385 --> 01:11:08,645
She knows me.

984
01:11:11,305 --> 01:11:12,405
Jane.

985
01:11:32,063 --> 01:11:33,223
You bitch.

986
01:11:34,342 --> 01:11:36,942
You fucking bitch.

987
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:54,500
I've been bit, Dad.

988
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:57,380
This is all your
doing, Muldoon.

989
01:12:00,419 --> 01:12:02,319
Take cover you stupid fuck.

990
01:12:05,939 --> 01:12:06,819
Go, go, go.

991
01:12:17,257 --> 01:12:18,577
You can stop this.

992
01:12:19,057 --> 01:12:20,497
You can stop it right now.

993
01:12:23,096 --> 01:12:24,016
Not a chance in the world.

994
01:12:36,775 --> 01:12:37,615
Come and get me.

995
01:12:38,415 --> 01:12:39,375
Come and get me.

996
01:12:40,134 --> 01:12:40,974
This way.

997
01:12:41,734 --> 01:12:42,694
Over this way.

998
01:12:43,374 --> 01:12:45,134
Guess who’s coming
to dinner, Muldoon.

999
01:12:52,054 --> 01:12:53,174
Son of a bitch.

1000
01:13:12,291 --> 01:13:13,451
Come on.

1001
01:13:16,970 --> 01:13:18,650
Here's your last
shot, Muldoon.

1002
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:25,490
Let's get out of here boys.

1003
01:15:52,313 --> 01:15:53,833
Come out you skunk.

1004
01:15:55,633 --> 01:15:57,273
I've got one bullet
left, Muldoon.

1005
01:15:57,313 --> 01:15:59,533
Come out so I
can give it to you.

1006
01:16:07,711 --> 01:16:09,191
I've got one left too.

1007
01:16:09,911 --> 01:16:10,991
Say you was wrong.

1008
01:16:12,071 --> 01:16:14,071
Say you was wrong and
I've been right all along.

1009
01:16:14,311 --> 01:16:15,271
Right?

1010
01:16:15,831 --> 01:16:18,571
Does any of this look
right to you Seamus?

1011
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:19,990
Dad.

1012
01:16:21,670 --> 01:16:23,810
I've seen everything
die around me.

1013
01:16:24,989 --> 01:16:25,949
Now I'm dying.

1014
01:16:28,509 --> 01:16:30,729
I don't want to think
of you as dead too.

1015
01:16:35,589 --> 01:16:42,689
Seamus, I'll go so far as to say
I have seen the error of my ways.

1016
01:16:43,187 --> 01:16:47,247
Now if you we'll excuse me, I'd like
to spend a moment with my daughter.

1017
01:16:52,267 --> 01:16:53,267
No.

1018
01:16:55,707 --> 01:16:56,827
You bastard, Muldoon.

1019
01:17:30,702 --> 01:17:31,422
It's over.

1020
01:17:36,422 --> 01:17:37,062
Let's go.

1021
01:17:37,822 --> 01:17:38,422
Move.

1022
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:58,560
She did it.

1023
01:18:20,736 --> 01:18:22,456
One shot left.

1024
01:18:26,736 --> 01:18:29,576
Wait, wait.

1025
01:18:30,936 --> 01:18:31,696
It happened.

1026
01:18:32,935 --> 01:18:34,215
What happened?

1027
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,955
My sister, she ...

1028
01:18:41,734 --> 01:18:43,374
She said I wasn't
strict enough.

1029
01:18:44,374 --> 01:18:46,014
to shoot one of my own.

1030
01:18:48,294 --> 01:18:48,854
I did it.

1031
01:18:49,613 --> 01:18:50,873
Didn't I?

1032
01:18:51,653 --> 01:18:54,933
- You okay?
- Right as rain

1033
01:18:55,573 --> 01:18:57,133
Good luck to ya.

1034
01:19:01,932 --> 01:19:02,492
Let's go.

1035
01:19:07,731 --> 01:19:09,171
Here's a boat.

1036
01:19:17,011 --> 01:19:17,771
Look.

1037
01:19:18,331 --> 01:19:20,641
There's a world out there
and there's money out there.

1038
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:22,940
The reason we came
out here is because

1039
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:25,369
we'd thought it would
better than any place else.

1040
01:19:26,249 --> 01:19:27,329
Still could be.

1041
01:19:27,609 --> 01:19:30,529
What makes you think we won't
turn out like these assholes?

1042
01:19:30,729 --> 01:19:32,209
Yeah, who knows?

1043
01:19:32,809 --> 01:19:35,329
You and me might end up shooting
at each other one of these days.

1044
01:19:35,529 --> 01:19:39,349
Yeah we might kid if either one
of us ends up being full grown.

1045
01:19:47,087 --> 01:19:48,887
<i> I was on the Flynn
side from the beginning. </i>

1046
01:19:48,887 --> 01:19:51,627
<i> So I just saw Muldoon
as the enemy. </i>

1047
01:19:53,966 --> 01:19:55,686
<i> But I always wondered. </i>

1048
01:20:01,165 --> 01:20:02,925
<i> We decided to take
the money and run. </i>

1049
01:20:04,325 --> 01:20:05,605
<i> Still I wondered. </i>

1050
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:09,945
<i> What if we could teach the dead
to eat something that wasn't us? </i>

1051
01:20:11,284 --> 01:20:12,484
<i> What if Muldoon was right? </i>

1052
01:20:15,484 --> 01:20:16,904
<i> I guess we'll never know. </i>

1053
01:20:35,282 --> 01:20:36,922
<i> In an us versus them world, </i>

01:20:37,002 --> 01:20:41,642
<i> someone puts up a flag an another
person tears it down and put's up his own. </i>

1055
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:45,820
<i> Pretty soon no one remembers what
started the war in the first place </i>

1056
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:49,380
<i> and the fighting becomes
all about those stupid flags. </i>
