be the one to talk to.

187
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:28,876
I mean he tinkered with his
own brain to such tragic ends.

188
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,510
OK.

189
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:31,712
So what we got on
the table is a--

190
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:32,780
KYLE SULLIVAN: You Shane Carver?

191
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,216
COACH EARHORN: Standard
American bullfrog.

192
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:39,887
-You writing my biography?

193
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:42,690
-You got the band?

194
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,024
-We have a kick-ass band.

195
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,630
Not for little puke
narcs like you, though.

196
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,430
-I'm not a narc.

197
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,265
-Oh, you say.

198
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,868
KYLE SULLIVAN: I saw you
were looking for a drummer.

199
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:56,069
-Do you play?

200
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,939
KYLE SULLIVAN: Not
great, just basic stuff.

201
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,109
-Because this is going
to be an excellent band.

202
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,277
We're going to play gigs
in Seattle and shit.

203
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,880
We're going to be super
duper fucking hardcore.

204
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,383
None of that pussy bullshit.

205
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:13,086
You sure you're not a narc?

206
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:15,222
[chuckle]

207
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:17,991
-I'm not a narc.

208
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,027
-You get high?

209
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,828
-Yeah.

210
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:25,833
-I saw you talking to Chloe.

211
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,668
She's a real babe.

212
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:30,604
-Yeah, she's OK.

213
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:33,006
-Like frogs?

214
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,474
-Not really.

215
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,442
SHANE CARVER: Me either.

216
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:42,816
[laughing]

217
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:50,758
COACH EARHORN: Mr. Carver,
what are you doing?

218
00:09:50,858 --> 00:09:51,558
[laughing]

219
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:52,525
Mr. Carver?

220
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:53,326
[laughing]

221
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,328
What are you doing?

222
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,129
Carver--

223
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,498
[laughing]

224
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,633
Get off the table right now.

225
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:00,433
[laughing]

226
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,401
Get down.

227
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,170
Munn, shut up.

228
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,639
Carver, get down off
the table right now.

229
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:06,606
Get down.

230
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:08,876
Get off the table right now!

231
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:10,210
Oh, Jesus.

232
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,813
COACH EARHORN: Get off
the fucking table now!

233
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:13,613
[laughing]

234
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:14,581
Down!

235
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:17,951
Get down.

236
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:19,019
[clinking]

237
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,387
COACH EARHORN: Off
the fucking table now.

238
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:21,855
STUDENT: I can't
believe he ate it.

239
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,724
-Wait for me outside.

240
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,258
[laughing]

241
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,028
Everybody stay put and be
quiet until I get back.

242
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,730
-Fucking hardcore.

243
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,032
[cheering]

244
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:45,278
-Elbows off the table, please.

245
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,246
BARBARA SULLIVAN: Thank you.

246
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:54,955
-Eat your dinner.

247
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,797
-So how was school today?

248
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,298
-Fine.

249
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:08,301
-Answer your mother
in complete sentences.

250
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,104
-It was fine.

251
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:14,775
BARBARA SULLIVAN: Did you learn
anything new and exciting?

252
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:18,045
-Biology was cool.

253
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:20,047
We cut open frogs and
stimulated their muscles

254
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:22,682
with electrical wires
to make them twitch.

255
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,885
-Oh.

256
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:26,787
-One guy bit the
frog's head right off.

257
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,555
-Please, not at the table.

258
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:37,297
-Your hair is getting so dark.

259
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:40,600
KEN SULLIVAN: You miss
your old buzz cut?

260
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,269
-It used to get green from
the chlorine, remember?

261
00:11:53,781 --> 00:11:54,647
-Is that better?

262
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:01,621
CHLOE: Kyle.

263
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,392
KYLE SULLIVAN: Hey,
how's it going?

264
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:06,794
Let me see your fingernails.

265
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,428
Hmm, no good.

266
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:09,229
[chuckling]

267
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:10,530
We should smoke now.

268
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,398
-May I?

269
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,469
-Oh, hey, look.

270
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,305
Chloe's hanging with
little narc boy.

271
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,439
-Why don't you get an IQ, Munn.

272
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:20,974
You wouldn't know a
narc if he booked you.

273
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,546
That guy's got like
three brain cells left.

274
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:28,481
He's OD'd four times.

275
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,818
Once he was in the hospital
for two weeks for huffing Pam.

276
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:31,618
-What?

277
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,120
-Huffing Pam?

278
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,387
-I don't get it.

279
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,655
-The cooking spray.

280
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,456
[laughing]

281
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:37,858
-That's nasty.

282
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,660
[laughing]

283
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,996
COACH EARHORN: OK, so
this particular compound

284
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:43,997
could not be simpler.

285
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:47,067
Who wants to diagram it for me?

286
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:48,535
Anybody?

287
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:51,038
Well, it seems we have a
resident expert on water

288
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:53,206
right here in class.

289
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:55,175
Mr. Sullivan has
learned to defy the laws

290
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,643
of nature pertaining to water.

291
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:58,611
He's able to move through
it at alarming speed.

292
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:02,682
So it only seems right he should
come up and give it a shot.

293
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,052
What do you say, Mr. Sullivan?

294
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:07,955
-Leave me the fuck alone.

295
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:08,788
COACH EARHORN: I'm sorry.

296
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,290
What was that?

297
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,460
-I said leave me the fuck alone.

298
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,529
COACH EARHORN: Well, that's
not the right answer to all.

299
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,931
Why don't you go to
the principal's office

300
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:18,932
and talk to him about it?

301
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:19,732
That'll be fun.

302
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:26,806
[chuckling]

303
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,985
-Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah,

304
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:40,053
blah, blah, blah, good student.

305
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,088
Blah, blah, blah, All-American.

306
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:48,228
Blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

307
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,196
[phone ringing]

308
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:52,365
-Well, some schools
would buy you

309
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,701
a new car for transferring
to their team.

310
00:13:57,604 --> 00:14:02,109
Some schools would have a-- a
special pep rally just for you.

311
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:03,776
We haven't done
those things, but I

312
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:06,846
think we've been
hospitable, don't you?

313
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:09,516
Why is it that kids are
normal, normal, normal,

314
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:11,684
and they come to
my school, and they

315
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,486
decide to become
career criminals?

316
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:22,829
-Get suspended?

317
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,498
-Nah, just ragged on
me for a little while.

318
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,600
-Isn't he a major prick, man?

319
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,202
-More like a little, tiny one.

320
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:32,305
[chuckling]

321
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:37,144
-Did you blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah?

322
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:39,446
It never fails.

323
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:43,583
You know, I meant to cut that
motherfucker's tongue out.

324
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:44,651
I could do it, too.

325
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:45,818
RORY: No, shit.

326
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,921
No, shit.

327
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:50,123
-Munn's in the band.

328
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,824
He plays bass.

329
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:53,093
KYLE SULLIVAN: Cool.

330
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:55,795
-Me too, man.

331
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,730
-Yeah.

332
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:02,169
Ferry's maybe going to
play, um, with himself.

333
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:03,836
[laughing]

334
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,025
Excellent.

335
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:25,993
Nice.

336
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:28,962
All right.

337
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:31,298
Know where the park is?

338
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:32,199
-Think so.

339
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:33,300
The state park?

340
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,901
-Yeah.

341
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:36,603
Kroller State Park.

342
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,038
We hang out in
the woods straight

343
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,306
back from the playground.

344
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:43,243
It's like 10 minutes
walk, straight back.

345
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:46,313
You should come.

346
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:47,114
-Maybe, yeah.

347
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,384
-You should come.

348
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:55,255
BARBARA SULLIVAN: Kyle?

349
00:15:57,924 --> 00:15:58,858
Kyle?

350
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,927
-Yeah?

351
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:03,630
-You going out?

352
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,132
-Yeah.

353
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:07,200
BARBARA SULLIVAN: Well,
your-- your father

354
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,502
is at some mysterious
meeting, and I thought maybe

355
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:12,572
you'd like to hang out
and watch a movie with me.

356
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:15,408
-Do you even know what he does?

357
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:18,011
Why we moved here?

358
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:19,412
-Computers, honey.

359
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:20,880
-Fucking asshole.

360
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,215
BARBARA SULLIVAN: Hey.

361
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:25,085
-He didn't even think about
what we were supposed to do.

362
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,020
BARBARA SULLIVAN:
That's not true.

363
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,888
He just--

364
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:29,722
[sigh]

365
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,759
doesn't know how to talk to you.

366
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:35,895
He took this job
with you in mind,

367
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,032
helping you get over Terry.

368
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:40,267
-Whatever.

369
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:41,168
I've got to go.

370
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,858
[breathing heavily]

371
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,868
-Munn?

372
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,337
[music playing]

373
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:18,338
SHANE CARVER: All right.

374
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:19,272
Woohoo!

375
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,174
I guess the bonus
finally arrived.

376
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:22,475
KYLE SULLIVAN: What's up?

377
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:23,876
SHANE CARVER: Kyle.

378
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,646
This is maybe going to
be our drummer ya'll.

379
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,682
Just moved all the way up
from California, right?

380
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,451
What's that?

381
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,020
The second biggest partying
state on the West Coast?

382
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:35,388
[chuckling]

383
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:38,558
I invited Kyle here to
get fucked up with us.

384
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:39,359
Join the circle.

385
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,401
Don't worry about Munn.

386
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,370
He's mean.

387
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,338
He's stupid.

388
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:55,242
[coughing]

389
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:58,077
KYLE SULLIVAN: What
the hell is this?

390
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:00,347
-It's crystal.

391
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:01,848
It's nice, motherfucker.

392
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:02,849
it's good, right?

393
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:06,753
-Oh, shit.

394
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,221
-It's great, right?

395
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,893
Take some of this,
balance it out.

396
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:17,230
-What's that?

397
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,030
Acid?

398
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:21,834
-Nah, it's just mescaline.

399
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,836
-No way.

400
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,637
-Go on.

401
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:26,038
Take it.

402
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:27,640
You'll be way too fucked
up from the crystal.

403
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,385
Kyle, take it.

404
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:42,522
We all have to be equally
fucked up for the blood ritual.

405
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,491
-Wait, what?

406
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:46,159
[laughing]

407
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,965
SHANE CARVER: I'm just
fucking with you, dude.

408
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:57,937
Kyle Man, you better
take that [inaudible].

409
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:01,641
You're beginning to
look a little green.

410
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,976
[chuckling]

411
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,946
Ferry?

412
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:09,749
Go get Kyle a beer.

413
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,418
RORY: I'll get him
a cold one, Shane.

414
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:15,188
-Now.

415
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:20,927
-Here.

416
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:23,496
I think this one's cold.

417
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:24,331
Is it cold?

418
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:26,599
-It feels cold.

419
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:27,967
-Taste it.

420
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,402
It's cold, I--I think.

421
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,441
-Tastes cold.

422
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:35,342
[chuckling]

423
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:36,276
I'm Kyle.

424
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:37,544
-I'm Rory Leary.

425
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:38,611
-Hey, Rory.

426
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:42,782
-You can either call
me Leary or-- or Ferry,

427
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:47,086
but I like Rory the best.

428
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,522
-Yeah, I'll just call you Rory.

429
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:50,623
-Yeah.

430
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:51,791
[inaudible]

431
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:54,894
Hey, maybe you can even
start a trend, you know?

432
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:55,862
-Get the fuck out of here.

433
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:57,397
What the fuck are you doing?

434
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:58,631
-Just trying to be
friendly, Shane.

435
00:19:58,731 --> 00:19:59,499
-What did I say to you?

436
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,801
What did I say to you?

437
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,670
Did I tell you to be friendly?

438
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,672
Did I tell you to
hang around and chat?

439
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:07,540
Did I?

440
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,208
Get the fuck out of my face.

441
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,513
Go put some more
wood on the fire.

442
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:21,654
I keep Rory around to
run errands and shit.

443
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,756
I tell him he's in
the Black Circle Boys,

444
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:30,697
but-- but he has to spend
a year being my servant.

445
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:35,134
The little asshole
just takes it.

446
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,369
-What are the Black Circle Boys?

447
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:42,342
-You don't just ask
out of curiosity.

448
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:45,345
You know what I'm saying?

449
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:47,847
-No.

450
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:49,349
-You see all these people here?

451
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:55,154
They're in what I
call the circle.

452
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,989
A circle is not exclusive.

453
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:07,734
The Black Circle Boys-- super
exclusive, just me and Munn.

454
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:11,003
We let Ferry come along, but
he doesn't have the tattoo.

455
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,239
Munn, show Kyle the tattoo.

456
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:21,781
And Danny was in it, but
the fuckhead moved to Boise.

457
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:24,351
I'd love to cut his heart out
and feed it to his mother's

458
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:26,953
fucking little
Bichon Frise, and I

459
00:21:27,053 --> 00:21:28,287
would have every right to do it.

460
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:31,824
You know what I'm saying?

461
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,793
A brotherhood is a brotherhood.

462
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:39,632
It's sacred, a fucking
blood oath to the father.

463
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:43,570
You don't just go and
move to fucking Boise.

464
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:47,707
You don't fuck with brotherhood.

465
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,842
I'm looking for a
warrior, someone

466
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:55,648
to get deep into the shit
because it gets fucking deep.

467
00:21:55,748 --> 00:22:01,020
I'm talking about power
to do anything you want.

468
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,823
You could get like
any girl you want.

469
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:06,025
You could kick ass in school.

470
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,227
Personally, I never
use it for that.

471
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:15,602
For cars, money, fame,
girls, you name it, whatever.

472
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:18,571
And you could like
achieve it, but you

473
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,240
have to make a commitment.

474
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,241
So are you going to be a pussy?

475
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,211
Or are you going
to do some drugs?

476
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:26,713
[chuckling]

477
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,153
All right.

478
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:36,122
[heart pounding]

479
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,594
[voices]

480
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:50,269
-Kyle, are you OK?

481
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,071
[chuckle]

482
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:52,872
KYLE SULLIVAN: Chloe.

483
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:53,840
CHLOE: Good.

484
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,642
You're not as
stoned as you look.

485
00:22:55,742 --> 00:22:57,877
KYLE SULLIVAN: What
are you doing here?

486
00:22:57,977 --> 00:23:01,648
CHLOE: I was at another party,
but I had to come out here.

487
00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:04,216
I figured you'd be hanging
with the headbangers.

488
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:09,456
KYLE SULLIVAN: Mmm, you
came out just for me?

489
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:10,356
CHLOE: Yeah.

490
00:23:10,457 --> 00:23:11,724
KYLE SULLIVAN: Oh, no.

491
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:13,560
[laughing]

492
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,095
It's just like Shane said.

493
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:19,632
CHLOE: Wow, I come out here
to party with these guys

494
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,267
every once in a
while, but they're

495
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:22,835
not exactly my kind of people.

496
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,212
-Where the fuck is he?

497
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:33,980
Kyle?

498
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:40,186
Guest of honor, and the
motherfucker isn't even here.

499
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:40,987
Kyle!

500
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:50,730
What are you doing with my boy?

501
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,500
-Shane, even in your
dreams, he's not your boy.

502
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,173
-That's cool.

503
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,777
It's just girl-related,
not a big deal.

504
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:06,012
[laughing]

505
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:07,647
Everybody put out your
left hand, all right?

506
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:11,718
We're going to make a little
offering to the father.

507
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:12,952
-Shane, what the
fuck are you doing?

508
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:15,354
-Shut the fuck up.

509
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,557
Everybody is going
to be fine, OK?

510
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:18,925
-What's your definition of fine?

511
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:20,493
Him?

512
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:21,928
-Do you want me to go first?

513
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,634
-I'm out of here.

514
00:24:27,734 --> 00:24:28,801
[laughing]

515
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,223
SHANE CARVER: Let's go, Ferry.

516
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,602
Oh, father, through
the gift of your power,

517
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:04,571
we worship and honor you.

518
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:07,540
We worship and honor you alone.

519
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:12,011
[mumbling]

520
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:29,896
SHANE CARVER: It's all done.

521
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:30,730
Thank you, father.

522
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:37,503
Hey, we're all done.

523
00:25:37,604 --> 00:25:39,371
It's a fucking party.

524
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:40,740
Yeah!

525
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,942
We're just jammin' and jam,
and jam, and jam, and jam, jam.

526
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,310
-You can't air play drums.

527
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,411
-Yeah, you can.

528
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:46,913
-No, I'd have to go
like--I'd have to go--

529
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:51,851
-[inaudible].

530
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:04,731
[laughing]

531
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:05,732
MUNN: Open up.

532
00:26:05,832 --> 00:26:08,768
[laughing]

533
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,147
[laughing]

534
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:21,948
MUNN: Whoo!

535
00:26:22,048 --> 00:26:22,915
[laughing]

536
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:35,394
-What do you think
we should look like?

537
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:37,797
-Maybe we should see
what we sound like first.

538
00:26:37,897 --> 00:26:41,333
-Yeah, but you want
to look cool, right?

539
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,002
I mean, Black Circle Boys.

540
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:46,105
You want to sound a
certain way, you know?

541
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:46,939
-Yeah.

542
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,775
-Did you get those drums yet?

543
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:49,642
-No.

544
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:51,610
Just a snare and a high hat.

545
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:52,478
-Don't worry about it.

546
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:54,446
We'll get you some drums.

547
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:56,482
Our fucking band is
going to kick ass.

548
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:58,284
Got the vehicle today?

549
00:26:58,384 --> 00:26:59,085
-Yeah.

550
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:00,052
You need a ride?

551
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:03,422
-I've got something
you need to see.

552
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:05,157
There used to be a
whole wood pulp mill

553
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:09,395
here, man, before the logging
industry went to shit.

554
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:12,965
My dad used to make bucks.

555
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:15,868
Tug boats hauling
shit in and out.

556
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:19,305
-Your dad was a logger?

557
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:22,074
-Still is when there's work.

558
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:23,409
Sometimes when
they need people, I

559
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:26,445
go, um, go up with
him to set chokes.

560
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:27,814
Like when they're
hauling the trees away,

561
00:27:27,914 --> 00:27:29,916
you've got to run and wrap
this big fucking cable around

562
00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:33,820
and get out of the way before
it takes your hand right off.

563
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,389
-I don't even know
what my dad does.

564
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,426
-Yeah, but he
makes money, right?

565
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:41,227
-I guess.

566
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:50,669
-Check this out.

567
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:55,307
Here, come on.

568
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:56,976
KYLE SULLIVAN: doing, man?

569
00:27:57,076 --> 00:27:58,377
It's cold.

570
00:27:58,477 --> 00:27:59,445
SHANE CARVER: It doesn't matter.

571
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:00,913
[splash]

572
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:03,382
SHANE CARVER
(VOICEOVER): You see it?

573
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:05,251
KYLE SULLIVAN (VOICEOVER): What?

574
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:06,452
SHANE CARVER (VOICEOVER): Power.

575
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:09,188
I'm getting more and more
powerful every second.

576
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,208
-What the hell did you do?

577
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:31,310
That was like 10 minutes.

578
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,846
No one in the world can
hold their breath that long.

579
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:39,585
-It's power.

580
00:28:39,685 --> 00:28:42,955
You see it?

581
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,324
I'm alive and dead
at the same time.

582
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:57,536
[sniffing]

583
00:28:57,636 --> 00:29:00,472
Oh, uhh.

584
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,174
Oh, we're out of drugs.

585
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:04,243
[sniffing]

586
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:06,745
Ah.

587
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:12,284
Let's go do some houses
and go visit Greggo.

588
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:13,820
-Yoohoo!

589
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,821
Yes!

590
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:15,822
Do some houses!

591
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:17,289
Do some houses!

592
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:19,291
[laughing]

593
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:21,760
[yelling]

594
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:35,674
MUNN: Oh, shit!

595
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,676
[laughing]

596
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:31,931
SHANE CARVER: Yes!

597
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:33,199
Fucking excellent!

598
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:34,000
Kyle, man?

599
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:39,872
Recreational drug users.

600
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:40,873
KYLE SULLIVAN: Oh.

601
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:42,841
[laughing]

602
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:51,918
MUNN: I love "Transformers."

603
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:53,552
[laughing]

604
00:30:58,157 --> 00:30:59,225
-Yeah.

605
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:01,560
I like them so much.

606
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,528
[laughing]

607
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:03,795
[cough]

608
00:31:03,896 --> 00:31:06,465
-I mean, can you
imagine being a robot

609
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:08,034
who can change into a car.

610
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:11,103
And just go from robot
to car, robot to car,

611
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:14,740
never even having
to be a person?

612
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,475
-(ROBOT VOICE) Transformers.

613
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:18,410
[laughing]

614
00:31:27,353 --> 00:31:28,820
SHANE CARVER: Now,
whatever you do,

615
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:30,356
don't say anything
about how fucking

616
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:31,857
bad Greggo's place stinks.

617
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:32,691
All right?

618
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:35,227
He's real sensitive about it.

619
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:36,028
All right?

620
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:36,963
KYLE SULLIVAN: All right.

621
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:37,763
RORY: Yeah.

622
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,639
[gun cocking]

623
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:48,640
-Shit, get down.

624
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,441
Grego?

625
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:50,476
Grego?

626
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,078
It's me, Shane, Shane Carver.

627
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:53,212
Come on.

628
00:31:53,312 --> 00:31:54,580
Me and my friends got
some stuff for you.

629
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,516
It's cool.

630
00:31:57,616 --> 00:31:58,750
Come on, it's Shane.

631
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:04,456
-Hidey, Shane.

632
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:05,491
[chuckle]

633
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:06,458
Come on in.

634
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,644
Who's this?

635
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:27,146
KYLE SULLIVAN: I'm Kyle.

636
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:29,615
-Kyle, huh?

637
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:33,552
You look like a narc to me.

638
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:35,587
Are you a fucking
narc, pretty boy?

639
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:36,388
-Fuck you.

640
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:37,489
[laughing]

641
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:38,490
KYLE SULLIVAN: It's Kyle, man.

642
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,093
Greggo, he's a good soldier.

643
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:43,562
GREGGO: A good soldier, huh?

644
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:47,433
But will you fuck me?

645
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:51,003
Want to fuck me, good solider?

646
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:51,803
[chuckle]

647
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,272
SHANE CARVER: No, Greggo.

648
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:55,574
He's going to take Danny's
place in the Black Circle Boys.

649
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:56,508
GREGGO: Danny?

650
00:32:56,608 --> 00:33:00,779
Kyle is much
prettier than Danny.

651
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:04,616
So tell me Kyle, do
you accept our father?

652
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:08,954
KYLE SULLIVAN: Yeah.

653
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:09,755
[chuckling]

654
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:10,689
KYLE SULLIVAN: I don't know.

655
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:12,358
I--I guess.

656
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:15,227
-Oh, he's so passionate.

657
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,863
It's nothing to be
ashamed of, you know.

658
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:20,766
It's not necessarily
a bad thing.

659
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:24,070
Now Shane here, on
the other hand, well,

660
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,471
that's a whole
different story, see?

661
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:28,207
Because Shane is a bad thing.

662
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:29,641
[sniffing]

663
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:33,479
[chuckling]

664
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:36,715
Now what do you boys got for me?

665
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:39,251
-Hey, let's go pool hopping.

666
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:40,052
MUNN: Yes!

667
00:33:40,152 --> 00:33:40,852
[laughing]

668
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:41,920
-What's pool hopping?

669
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,556
MUNN: Give me a smoke, bag!

670
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:45,991
Whee!

671
00:33:46,092 --> 00:33:50,296
[splashing]

672
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:51,863
[laughing and cheering]

673
00:33:58,337 --> 00:34:01,006
MALE HOMEOWNER: Get the hell
out of my pool right now.

674
00:34:01,107 --> 00:34:02,308
SHANE CARVER: Suck me!

675
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:04,310
MALE HOMEOWNER:
What did you say?

676
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,778
-I said suck me you old fart.

677
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,247
Fuck you.

678
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:09,215
[laughing]

679
00:34:09,315 --> 00:34:10,048
[dog barking]

680
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:11,683
KYLE SULLIVAN: Let's go, Shane.

681
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:12,651
-Give me a fucking break.

682
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:13,852
What is he going to do?

683
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:15,621
Call the cops and get
us for trespassing?

684
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,789
MALE HOMEOWNER: I
know who you are.

685
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,525
-Oh, no!

686
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:20,326
Now I'm scared!

687
00:34:20,426 --> 00:34:21,393
[dog barking]

688
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:24,730
FEMALE HOMEOWNER:
John, call the police.

689
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,966
-Hey, you sound sexy.

690
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,536
MALE HOMEOWNER:
You're Shane Carver.

691
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:32,304
You think I'm afraid of you?

692
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:33,739
SHANE CARVER: Oh,
I know you are.

693
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,041
KYLE SULLIVAN: Shane,
let's take off.

694
00:34:36,142 --> 00:34:37,709
-Point a fucking gun at me?

695
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:40,078
MALE HOMEOWNER: Just go, please.

696
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:43,515
-You think I'm afraid of
death you old fuck, huh?

697
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:44,850
Look at me.

698
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:47,519
I'll take you straight to hell
with me you piece of shit.

699
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:50,122
I'll shove that fucking
thing right up your ass.

700
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:51,290
Come on, shoot me.

701
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:52,891
Come on, do it!

702
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:53,692
Do it.

703
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:54,660
Do it!

704
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,861
Shoot me!

705
00:34:55,961 --> 00:34:57,296

Come on.

709

Shoot me.

710
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,040
Do it.

711
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:10,542
Fucking do it.

712
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:19,251
I'll make you suck
my cock in hell.

713
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:24,089
You're fucking dead.

714
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,090
[kiss]

715
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:36,034
[laughing]

716
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:40,206
That fucker is going to
pay for that shit big time.

717
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:41,640
Yeah.

718
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:45,877
I can't take all
this stuff home, man.

719
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,613
Munn, can you?

720
00:35:47,713 --> 00:35:50,316
-No, they'll find it, man.

721
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:51,116
-Kyle?

722
00:35:54,353 --> 00:35:57,155
-No, I don't think so.

723
00:35:57,256 --> 00:35:58,824
SHANE CARVER: Don't you
be fucking look at me.

724
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:01,026
You'd fuck up somehow, I know.

725
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:02,828
-I guess.

726
00:36:02,928 --> 00:36:05,631
SHANE CARVER: Nobody fucks
with this unless I say.

727
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:06,698
OK?

728
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:07,633
You got it?

729
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:08,434
-M-hm.

730
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:33,492
-Our secret, right?

731
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:35,394
[bell ringing]

732
00:36:35,494 --> 00:36:37,296
COACH EARHORN: Kyle?

733
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:38,730
Sullivan?

734
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,165
Hey, come here.

735
00:36:40,266 --> 00:36:41,333
-Hey, don't touch him.

736
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:44,035
-Go to class, Froggie.

737
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:44,836
-Look, man.

738
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:45,637
-What?

739
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:50,576
-Check it out.

740
00:36:50,676 --> 00:36:52,378
-Kyle Man, is that you?

741
00:36:52,478 --> 00:36:54,780
You're fucking white.

742
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,315
-Times like that, you
can get into any college

743
00:36:56,415 --> 00:36:57,849
in the country.

744
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,618
-It's not me.

745
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,553
It's not my picture.

746
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,271
-Who's this?

747
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:20,506
-It's Kyle Sullivan.

748
00:37:20,606 --> 00:37:21,307
He's totally cool.

749
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:22,240
Come on.

750
00:37:22,341 --> 00:37:23,275
He's a friend of
mine from school.

751
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:24,209
-Let me go.

752
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,477
-I don't want him
to see my face.

753
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,479
Did you see my face?

754
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:28,280
Did ya?

755
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,281
-No.

756
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:30,449
-I'm going running.

757
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:33,285
And when I get back,
you'd both better be gone.

758
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:34,152
OK?

759
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,855
-OK.

760
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:39,625
-You girls stay out of trouble.

761
00:37:39,725 --> 00:37:40,592
[thud]

762
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,599
-Fucking survivalist.

763
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:50,769
He thinks if fewer
people see his face,

764
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:53,439
the better off he'll be when
he disappears into the woods.

765
00:37:57,676 --> 00:37:59,711
You're a lucky man.

766
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:02,914
He could've snapped your neck.

767
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:05,183
-Great.

768
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,217
SHANE CARVER: Ronnie and Shane.

769
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:13,091
KYLE SULLIVAN:
That's your brother?

770
00:38:13,191 --> 00:38:13,892
-Was.

771
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:18,096
Died.

772
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:22,200
-Ronnie and Shane.

773
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:30,108
Did you ever have somebody
that balances you out?

774
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:33,078
Like whatever you
are, it's completely

775
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:37,115
balanced out by who they are?

776
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:39,485
-Yeah.

777
00:38:39,585 --> 00:38:40,886
I think so.

778
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:42,654
-He was totally good.

779
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:45,991
Not just-- not
just goodie-goodie.

780
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:47,859
You know?

781
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:49,461
Whenever you did
something bad, he

782
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:54,700
would just-- he would just look
at you like he didn't get it.

783
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,270
Not like he was mad or
anything, just I don't get it.

784
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:07,178
You better get out of here.

785
00:39:20,626 --> 00:39:21,527
[door closing]

787
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:33,104
-Are you coming in?

788
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:33,905
-No.

789
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:36,708
CHLOE: on, it's hot.

790
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:38,209
KYLE SULLIVAN: Hey.

791
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,678
Stop it.

792
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:42,013
-Where are you, Kyle?

793
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:44,149
KYLE SULLIVAN: What do you mean?

794
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:48,386
-Half the time you're with
me, you're not really with me.

795
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:50,121
-That's way too abstract for me.

796
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:53,459
Hey.

797
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:02,868
CHLOE: seem like you're some
place else, sad all the time.

798
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:04,135
I mean, look where we are.

799
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,771
It's a beautiful day.

800
00:40:05,871 --> 00:40:10,642
It's the first beautiful
day in the last ten years.

801
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:13,211
And there's nobody
here, just us.

802
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:45,410
[loud music playing]

803
00:40:45,511 --> 00:40:47,078
-Let me see some ID.

804
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:47,913
-It's cool, man.

805
00:40:48,013 --> 00:40:49,080
Greggo said we could come here.

806
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:49,881
BOUNCER: Yo, Greggo.

807
00:40:56,922 --> 00:40:58,790
Oh, fuck you.

Whoo!

Where you at?

811
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:08,233
Come on over.

-Fuck them.

819
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:18,844
They're going to
open for us, right?

820
00:41:18,944 --> 00:41:19,477
-Yeah.

821
00:41:19,578 --> 00:41:20,245
ANGRY WOMAN: Lane.

822
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:21,112
Lane something.

823
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:22,313
No, Shane!

824
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:23,314
Shane!

825
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,383
You fucked up my
little brother's eyes.

826
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,885
You hit him with a bottle.

827
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,386
You little fucking ass!

828
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,388
He can't even
fucking see anymore.

829
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,858
He can't even see!

830
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:34,359
Fuck you!

831
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:35,561

doing on stage, man?

838
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:49,567
-I want to give you
some drugs, man.

839
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:51,236
Fucking crystal and shit.

840
00:42:51,336 --> 00:42:52,037
-Awesome.

841
00:42:52,137 --> 00:42:53,038
-Check that out.

842
00:42:53,138 --> 00:42:54,172
-Excellent.

843
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:55,774
-I was hoping you guys'
band would get together

844
00:42:55,874 --> 00:42:57,508
with us later and
give us some advice.

845
00:42:57,609 --> 00:42:57,943
-Yeah.

846
00:42:58,043 --> 00:42:58,877
Yeah.

847
00:42:58,977 --> 00:42:59,510
Why don't we start
off with this.

848
00:42:59,611 --> 00:43:01,512
Fuck off.

849
00:43:01,613 --> 00:43:02,513
Fuck you, man.

Kyle?

860
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:32,678
Your father and I were
wondering if you'd

861
00:43:32,778 --> 00:43:36,614
like to talk about Terry?

862
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:37,582
KYLE SULLIVAN: No, thanks.

863
00:43:40,652 --> 00:43:42,287
-We'd like to know
how you're feeling.

864
00:43:42,387 --> 00:43:45,390
-Why don't you read
the police report, Mom?

865
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:48,259
They were pretty interested
in the whole thing.

866
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,395
They could probably
tell you more than me.

867
00:43:50,495 --> 00:43:51,229
-No, how you're feeling.

868
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:57,402
-You're only like
eight months late, Mom.

869
00:43:57,502 --> 00:44:00,405
-Yeah, well, sometimes we're
just shitty parents, Kyle.

870
00:44:00,505 --> 00:44:03,008
I'm trying, OK?

871
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:05,977
-It doesn't matter.

872
00:44:06,077 --> 00:44:07,212
-You know, your father and I--

873
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:10,415
-What's all this "you
father and I" crap?

874
00:44:10,515 --> 00:44:12,818
I don't see him here.

875
00:44:12,918 --> 00:44:16,487
He hasn't been in this
room since we moved here.

876
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:20,726
All I see is the back of his
head staring at the television.

-Sweetheart--

878
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,029
-Get out.

00:44:24,129 --> 00:44:26,832
-Don't talk to me like that.

880
00:44:26,932 --> 00:44:28,199
-Get out of my fucking room.

00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:29,000
-No!

at the cemetery tonight at 11.

00:45:05,837 --> 00:45:06,671
You know that?

888
00:45:06,772 --> 00:45:11,209
-No, man, I got
to get some sleep.

-[inaudible].

890
00:45:13,178 --> 00:45:14,012
This is business.

891
00:45:14,112 --> 00:45:16,948
This isn't optional.

892
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:19,150
-OK, but if I fall
asleep, you know--

893
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:19,951
-Don't worry.

So you should see the drums I
was checking out for you, man.

901
00:45:36,034 --> 00:45:37,268
They're fucking excellent.

902

-Man, I'm telling you, you're
going to be disappointed.

903
00:45:39,437 --> 00:45:40,872
-Bullshit, man.

904
00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:42,507
Our fucking band is
going to kick ass, right?

SHANE CARVER: Just wait
until you see this.

907

This is the real shit, Kyle.

908
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:56,087
We're going to do ourselves
a little grave robbing.

909
00:45:56,187 --> 00:45:59,357
Teach that motherfucker to
point a fucking gun at me.

910
00:45:59,457 --> 00:46:01,326
So I find out they're
like a big family, right.

911
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:02,861
They've been around
since the 1800s.

912
00:46:02,961 --> 00:46:04,762
They have a huge plot up here.

913
00:46:04,863 --> 00:46:06,397
Munn, pick up the drugs.

914
00:46:19,978 --> 00:46:21,312
SHANE CARVER: Mesc--

915
00:46:21,412 --> 00:46:23,681
-What?

916
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,584
SHANE CARVER: Somebody
took the Mescaline.

917
00:46:26,684 --> 00:46:27,418
-Don't look at me.

918
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:30,188
You said not to open up the bag.

919
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:31,656
SHANE CARVER: Fucking Ferry.

920
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:37,829
RORY: Hey.

921
00:46:41,066 --> 00:46:43,701
Hey, Shane?

922
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:47,272
Check out what I got for you.

923
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:50,341
Check out what I
got for you, man.

924
00:46:50,441 --> 00:46:51,642
I got you this guitar.

925
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:53,111
-You know what you did?

926
00:46:53,211 --> 00:46:54,880
-It's got all these
features on it.

927
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,347
It's got all these--
look at these knobs

928
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:58,083
here that you can play.

929
00:46:58,183 --> 00:47:02,120
-Just tell me you have
the Mescaline, Ferry.

930
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:03,989
-I got it from Todd
Presnall, right?

931
00:47:04,089 --> 00:47:05,356
And he said that
he would give it

932
00:47:05,456 --> 00:47:08,759
to me for special
deal beca-- Oh!

933
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:09,861
-Shut up.

934
00:47:09,961 --> 00:47:12,230
Shut the fuck up!

935
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:13,932
You tell me you
know what you did?

936
00:47:16,634 --> 00:47:18,503
You fucked with
the Black Circle.

937
00:47:18,603 --> 00:47:19,770
You know that?

938
00:47:19,871 --> 00:47:21,439
You fucked with the brotherhood.

939
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:22,340
-Yeah.

940
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,308
-What were you thinking?

941
00:47:23,408 --> 00:47:24,775
-I traded a guitar for you.

942
00:47:24,876 --> 00:47:25,676
-I know that.

943
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:27,745
But you went behind my back.

944
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,514
And you stole from me.

945
00:47:29,614 --> 00:47:31,649
You stole from every
single one of us.

946
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:33,318
[breathing heavily]

947
00:47:33,418 --> 00:47:36,922
-I just thought when you
saw the guitar, Shane--

948
00:47:43,028 --> 00:47:44,829
-Let me see the guitar, Ferry.

949
00:47:55,273 --> 00:47:59,110
[quickly strumming guitar]

950
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,579
-I like the guitar, Ferry.

951
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:03,048
-You do?

952
00:48:03,148 --> 00:48:05,016
Oh, Shane, it's got features.

953
00:48:05,116 --> 00:48:07,085
And there's an amp in the car.

954
00:48:07,185 --> 00:48:09,487
-But you still fucked up.

955
00:48:09,587 --> 00:48:13,224
You are in trouble.

956
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:14,692
-I know.

957
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:15,660
I know.

958
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,529
-Let me spell it
out for you, OK?

959
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:22,833
Without the mescaline, we
cannot do the blood ritual.

960
00:48:22,934 --> 00:48:25,536
Pissed me off.

961
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:27,705
You displeased the father.

962
00:48:27,805 --> 00:48:29,374
-I didn't mean to
displease the father.

963
00:48:29,474 --> 00:48:30,942
I didn't mean to
displease the father.

964
00:48:39,884 --> 00:48:41,752
-What am I going to
do with you, Ferry?

965
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:47,592
-I'm sorry.

966
00:48:47,692 --> 00:48:49,527
-You see why you're not ready to
be a part of the Black Circle?

967
00:48:49,627 --> 00:48:50,328
Do you?

968
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:51,429
-Uh-huh.

969
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:53,331
Yeah, I fucked up.

970
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:55,066
I fucked up.

971
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:57,168
-And you're going to have
to work extra hard, right?

972
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:57,969
-OK.

973
00:48:58,069 --> 00:48:58,569
-Right?

974
00:48:58,669 --> 00:48:58,936
-I will.
-Right?

975
00:48:59,037 --> 00:48:59,370
Yes?

976
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:00,105
-I will.

977
00:49:00,205 --> 00:49:01,306
Yeah.

978
00:49:01,406 --> 00:49:04,075
-And you're going to pay
me back for the drugs?

979
00:49:04,175 --> 00:49:04,909
200?

980
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:09,847
-Uh-huh, I will.

981
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,482
SHANE CARVER: Now get
down there and make

982
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:12,783
some soul ride in hell.

983
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:18,823
Hey, Ferry, let's see
how fast you can dig.

984
00:49:21,926 --> 00:49:23,528
-OK.

985
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:24,329
[chuckle]

986
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:25,930
I can dig fast, you know.

987
00:49:26,031 --> 00:49:29,267
The ground is all squishy.

988
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:30,568
Oh, wow.

989
00:49:30,668 --> 00:49:32,437
Oh, oh--

990
00:49:32,537 --> 00:49:34,605
-Just the skull
and the left hand.

991
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:35,506
RORY: Oh, Shane.

992
00:49:35,606 --> 00:49:38,143
I may not be too good at this.

993
00:49:38,243 --> 00:49:39,110
-Come on, Rory.

994
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:42,147
Here's the fucking
flashlight, huh?

995
00:49:42,247 --> 00:49:44,515
-I don't feel so well.

996
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:46,684
KYLE SULLIVAN: Rory, let's
get you out of there.

997
00:49:46,784 --> 00:49:47,718
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

998
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,320
Wait a minute!

999
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,422
We're not done.

1000
00:49:51,522 --> 00:49:53,091
And you're on fucking probation!

1001
00:49:53,191 --> 00:49:54,825
What does that mean to you?

1002
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:57,128
When things get tough,
you get up and take off?

1003
00:49:57,228 --> 00:49:57,928
Bullshit!

1004
00:49:58,029 --> 00:49:59,730
Fuck that, right, Munn?

1005
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,866
-Don't be a fucking
pussy, Ferry!

1006
00:50:01,966 --> 00:50:03,434
[laughing]

1007
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:04,235
SHANE CARVER: Know what?

1008
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,236
RORY: Knock it off!

1009
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:06,704
-I'm going to bury you alive.

1010
00:50:06,804 --> 00:50:09,407
RORY: Fucking knock it off.

1011
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:10,808
[laughing]

1012
00:50:10,908 --> 00:50:11,842
RORY: OK.
SHANE CARVER: Go.

1013
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:13,111
RORY: I--
[rory gagging and choking]

1014
00:50:13,211 --> 00:50:13,978
-[inaudible]--
-Pussy!

1015
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:14,912
[laughing]

1016
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,414
Man, you're such a pussy.

1017
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:17,215
[inaudible]

1018
00:50:17,315 --> 00:50:19,550
[laughing]

1019
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:20,951
RORY: I'll fucking do it.

1020
00:50:21,052 --> 00:50:22,953
I'm going to do it right now.

1021
00:50:23,054 --> 00:50:23,888
[laughing]

1022
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:24,822
RORY: OK.

1023
00:50:24,922 --> 00:50:27,125
OK, I'm doing it right now.

1024
00:50:27,225 --> 00:50:29,460
[laughing]

1025
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,528
RORY: OK.

1026
00:50:30,628 --> 00:50:32,363
I swear to God, I'm
doing it right now.

1027
00:50:32,463 --> 00:50:35,200
I'm doing it, OK?

1028
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,201
-You promise, huh?

1029
00:50:40,071 --> 00:50:41,239
-Do it!

1030
00:50:41,339 --> 00:50:42,573
Stop the car.

1031
00:50:42,673 --> 00:50:44,041
[tires screeching]

1032
00:50:48,479 --> 00:50:50,615
KYLE SULLIVAN: It's OK, Rory.

1033
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:53,251
It's OK.

1034
00:50:53,351 --> 00:50:54,585
-I'm scared, Kyle.

1035
00:50:54,685 --> 00:50:58,156
MUNN: Shut the fuck
up, diaper load.

1036
00:50:58,256 --> 00:51:00,225
And don't you sit there
holding his fucking hand.

1037
00:51:00,325 --> 00:51:01,726
Both of you just grow up.

1038
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:13,171
[cat meowing]

1039
00:51:13,271 --> 00:51:17,175
-Hey Rory, can I
give you a hand?

1040
00:51:17,275 --> 00:51:21,146
[laughing]

1041
00:51:21,246 --> 00:51:23,281
Greggo said fresh blood
on the bones of the dead

1042
00:51:23,381 --> 00:51:26,517
would force their spirits
right back into their bodies.

1043
00:51:26,617 --> 00:51:29,420
That doesn't feel too good when
you've been dead for 30 years.

1044
00:51:36,794 --> 00:51:38,363
Hey, honey.

1045
00:51:38,463 --> 00:51:39,164
[cat meowing]

1046
00:51:39,264 --> 00:51:40,165
Hey.

1047
00:51:40,265 --> 00:51:41,632
Hey.

1048
00:51:41,732 --> 00:51:43,634
Hey.

1049
00:51:43,734 --> 00:51:46,036
Such a nice kitty.

1050
00:51:46,137 --> 00:51:47,838
Yes, you are.

1051
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,275
A nice kitty.

1052
00:51:50,375 --> 00:51:53,178
Yes, yes.

1053
00:51:53,278 --> 00:51:54,812
[cat meowing]

1054
00:51:54,912 --> 00:51:55,613
Yes.

1055
00:51:59,584 --> 00:52:01,419
[cat growling]

1056
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:04,355
Nice kitty.

1057
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:07,858
[cat screeching]

1058
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:08,826
[thud]

1059
00:52:08,926 --> 00:52:11,329
[chanting quietly]

1060
00:52:31,249 --> 00:52:32,650
[tapping on window]

1061
00:52:39,757 --> 00:52:43,228
-I-- I'm scared, Kyle.

1062
00:52:43,328 --> 00:52:44,929
I don't know-- I
don't know what to do.

1063
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:46,764
-It seems like you've
got to pay him back.

1064
00:52:46,864 --> 00:52:49,567
-Where am I going to get $200?

1065
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,902
My mom-- she caught me trying
to steal money from her.

1066
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,105
Now I can't even
get near her purse.

1067
00:52:55,206 --> 00:52:56,641
KYLE SULLIVAN: Why'd
you take the Mescaline?

1068
00:52:56,741 --> 00:53:00,044
Rory, that was fucking stupid.

1069
00:53:00,144 --> 00:53:06,083
-I just thought if I walked
up to Shane with a guitar,

1070
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:10,388
it wouldn't have mattered where
the money came from, you know?

1071
00:53:10,488 --> 00:53:13,624
He would just say to me, I'm OK.

1072
00:53:13,724 --> 00:53:16,961
I'm OK.

1073
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:20,998
After all, because I got him
this cool guitar with all the,

1074
00:53:21,098 --> 00:53:24,435
you know, little special
features and stuff.

1075
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:30,174
Shitty Mescaline for a
cool guitar, you know?

1076
00:53:30,275 --> 00:53:34,979
I mean-- he was telling us we're
going to have this band when

1077
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:38,616
we get all the
instruments, Kyle.

1078
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:39,717
So I did it.

1079
00:53:39,817 --> 00:53:40,518
-Yeah.

1080
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:46,190
-I'm scared.

1081
00:53:49,093 --> 00:53:50,761
I'm scared.

1082
00:53:50,861 --> 00:53:53,498
-Just don't worry about it.

1083
00:53:53,598 --> 00:53:54,465
All right.

1084
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:56,434
I'm not going to
let him hurt you.

1085
00:53:56,534 --> 00:53:59,069
Just chill out until
you get the money.

1086
00:53:59,169 --> 00:53:59,870
-Yeah.

1087
00:54:13,217 --> 00:54:16,321
SHANE CARVERY: That's a stupid
fucking name for a band, man.

1088
00:54:16,421 --> 00:54:17,288
[laughing]

1089
00:54:17,388 --> 00:54:19,056
They deserve to get
ripped off, huh?

1090
00:54:19,156 --> 00:54:20,190
MUNN: Fuck them!

1091

01:03:08,986 --> 01:03:10,988
-You fucked up.

1272
01:03:11,088 --> 01:03:13,723
You fucked up.

1273
01:03:13,824 --> 01:03:14,791
Ah!

1274
01:03:14,892 --> 01:03:15,592
Ah!

1275
01:03:15,692 --> 01:03:17,862
Let's go.

1276
01:03:17,962 --> 01:03:19,796
[man groaning]

1277
01:03:27,171 --> 01:03:29,473
Kyle?

1278
01:03:29,573 --> 01:03:32,309
Kyle Man?

1279
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:35,445
Kyle, let's get the fuck out
of here before I get busted.

1280
01:03:35,545 --> 01:03:36,881
Come on!

1281
01:03:36,981 --> 01:03:37,647
-Sullivan!

1282
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:38,648
[whistle blowing]

1283
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:44,354
COACH EARHORN: Swimmers,
take your mark.

1284
01:03:44,454 --> 01:03:45,389
[whistle blowing]

1285
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:50,895
Swimmers, take your mark.

1286
01:03:50,995 --> 01:03:52,362
[whistle blowing]

1287
01:03:52,462 --> 01:03:54,364
[chuckling]

1288
01:03:54,464 --> 01:03:55,866
Oh, it's a catastrophe.

1289
01:03:58,602 --> 01:03:59,303
Come on!

1290
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:07,277
Hey, Sullivan?

1291
01:04:07,377 --> 01:04:11,515
You want to show these
weenies how to dive?

1292
01:04:11,615 --> 01:04:14,484
-Nah.

1293
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:15,452
-You all right?

1294
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:28,832
-Can I crash here?

1295
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:34,204
-I don't know.

1296
01:04:40,244 --> 01:04:44,314
No, you can't crash here?

1297
01:04:44,414 --> 01:04:45,449
-Kyle Man, what do you mean?

1298
01:04:48,852 --> 01:04:50,787
-I don't want you here.

1299
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:51,588
-Hey.

1300
01:04:54,524 --> 01:04:56,593
-I'm sick of it.

1301
01:04:56,693 --> 01:05:02,666
Shane, all we do is run around
and do mean stuff to people.

1302
01:05:02,766 --> 01:05:03,467
What's the point?

1303
01:05:06,136 --> 01:05:09,306
SHANE CARVERY: The point is
I saw you for the first time

1304
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:12,842
the other night taking
all your bad shit

1305
01:05:12,943 --> 01:05:14,544
inside and turning
it into power.

1306
01:05:18,148 --> 01:05:19,183
That's the fucking point.

1307
01:05:22,052 --> 01:05:25,089
That's what
[inaudible] let you do.

1308
01:05:25,189 --> 01:05:26,623
Right?

1309
01:05:26,723 --> 01:05:27,424
-I don't know.

1310
01:05:35,332 --> 01:05:42,106
-Kyle Man, he
talked to me, and he

1311
01:05:42,206 --> 01:05:44,508
told me all kinds of cool shit.

1312
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:49,813
And he said my father
isn't even my real father.

1313
01:05:49,913 --> 01:05:53,650
He said he's my father-- that
all this stuff we're doing,

1314
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:58,188
all of it-- it's for him.

1315
01:05:58,288 --> 01:05:59,156
-Yeah?

1316
01:05:59,256 --> 01:06:00,690
Well, I'm sick of it.

1317
01:06:04,061 --> 01:06:05,862
-You don't have that
option to be sick.

1318
01:06:10,567 --> 01:06:13,703
Like I told you when
you got down with us,

1319
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:18,975
we don't do this shit
lightly because it's

1320
01:06:19,076 --> 01:06:21,611
the fucking brotherhood.

1321
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:29,553
-You're not my brother,
and I'm not your brother.

1322
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:30,920
So fuck your brother.

1323
01:06:31,021 --> 01:06:32,622
SHANE CARVERY: Don't start
saying that stuff, Kyle.

1324
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:38,495
Don't start digging
your own fucking grave.

1325
01:06:38,595 --> 01:06:39,863
You don't want to do that.

1326
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:44,334
-Get the fuck out of my house.

1327
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:50,774
-You're so lucky
I love you, Kyle.

1328
01:06:50,874 --> 01:06:51,641
You have no idea.

1329
01:07:04,988 --> 01:07:06,690
KYLE SULLIVAN: Hey.

1330
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:07,491
Hey, Chloe?

1331
01:07:11,128 --> 01:07:12,729
-What's up?

1332
01:07:12,829 --> 01:07:14,731
-I was wondering
if we could talk.

1333
01:07:14,831 --> 01:07:15,532
-What?

1334
01:07:15,632 --> 01:07:17,134
Talk.

1335
01:07:17,234 --> 01:07:21,305
-Uh, maybe we could
hook up after school.

1336
01:07:21,405 --> 01:07:22,772
[bell ringing]

1337
01:07:25,809 --> 01:07:30,480
He landed between two buildings,
and he was there for a while

1338
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:35,485
because we had to
get the janitor

1339
01:07:35,585 --> 01:07:38,788
to unlock all the doors.

1340
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:39,589
And he was drunk.

1341
01:07:44,861 --> 01:07:49,233
Cops-- they took
forever to come back

1342
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:52,869
because they were still
pissed at us about their car.

1343
01:07:59,376 --> 01:08:04,881
His neck was broken, but he
was still alive when he landed.

1344
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:13,790
He just laid there.

1345
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:15,225
And he couldn't move.

1346
01:08:22,699 --> 01:08:25,869
So what actually finished
him off was the waiting.

1347
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:45,822
After that, I just kind
of went numb, I guess.

1348
01:08:45,922 --> 01:08:54,331
You know, like someone lowered
a big, glass dome over me.

1349
01:08:54,431 --> 01:08:58,935
And ev-- everything
on the outside

1350
01:08:59,035 --> 01:09:06,743
was like some-- like a
TV show or something.

1351
01:09:17,621 --> 01:09:22,892
Shane's the same
way all the time.

1352
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:30,166
He-- he-- he-- he can do
anything and not even blink.

1353
01:09:30,267 --> 01:09:31,535
-Be careful, Kyle.

1354
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:37,907
-So as the egg moves toward
maturity, it begins to divide.

1355
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:40,143
These divisions are
called cleavages.

1356
01:09:40,244 --> 01:09:41,678
And these cleavages
form a number

1357
01:09:41,778 --> 01:09:47,384
of cells which form a
hollow ball called what?

1358
01:09:47,484 --> 01:09:50,354
Anybody have any idea
what I'm talking about?

1359
01:09:50,454 --> 01:09:55,124
Does anybody have the slightest
clue what the answer might be?

1360
01:09:55,225 --> 01:09:55,959
Anybody awake?

1361
01:09:56,059 --> 01:09:58,828
Who wants to take a crack at it?

1362
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:00,430
Anybody?

1363
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:01,231
Mr. Sullivan?

1364
01:10:12,175 --> 01:10:13,510
-What?

1365
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:15,545
-Kyle Sullivan?

1366
01:10:15,645 --> 01:10:16,480
-Yeah.

1367
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:17,847
DETECTIVE RAY:
I'm Detective Ray.

1368
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:20,484
I want to ask you a few
questions about Shane Carver.

1369
01:10:20,584 --> 01:10:21,685
-Sorry.

1370
01:10:21,785 --> 01:10:23,253
DETECTIVE RAY: We know
about all the shit, Kyle--

1371
01:10:23,353 --> 01:10:25,455
all the shit you were
involved in with Shane.

1372
01:10:28,658 --> 01:10:29,726
Here, take my card.

1373
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:34,598
Hey, take the card.

1374
01:10:49,879 --> 01:10:51,748
SHANE CARVERY: We'll just
see if he's in there.

1375
01:10:51,848 --> 01:10:53,249
[laughing]

1376
01:10:56,786 --> 01:10:58,121
Whoop de-doo!

1377
01:10:58,221 --> 01:11:01,291
It's Professor Butt-wipe in
the parlor with a candlestick.

1378
01:11:01,391 --> 01:11:02,292
[laughing]

1379
01:11:02,392 --> 01:11:06,730
How about taking a
break, Professor?

1380
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:07,531
-What's up?

1381
01:11:10,133 --> 01:11:12,669
-Party for the circle.

1382
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,871
-Nah, man, I'm wasted.

1383
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:15,805
SHANE CARVERY: No shit, man.

1384
01:11:15,905 --> 01:11:17,307
It's an actual party.

1385
01:11:17,407 --> 01:11:18,107
Hey.

1386
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:19,709
No weird shit.

1387
01:11:19,809 --> 01:11:20,844
No Satan.

1388
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:27,384
Just hang out, drink a
couple beers, get high--

1389
01:11:27,484 --> 01:11:28,852
[laughing]

1390
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:31,655
-Nothing fancy.

1391
01:11:31,755 --> 01:11:32,989
KYLE SULLIVAN: I don't know.

1392
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:34,724
MUNN: Come on, dude.

1393
01:11:34,824 --> 01:11:38,662
-It'll only be a couple hours.

1394
01:11:38,762 --> 01:11:39,463
Promise.

1395
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:48,638
I guess everyone got
scared by the rain.

1396
01:11:48,738 --> 01:11:50,173
MUNN: Yeah.

1397
01:11:50,273 --> 01:11:54,644
SHANE CARVERY: Oh,
look what we have here.

1398
01:11:54,744 --> 01:11:56,079
RORY: Hey.

1399
01:11:56,179 --> 01:11:56,880
Hey.

1400
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:57,981
KYLE SULLIVAN: Hey, Rory.

1401
01:11:58,081 --> 01:11:58,782
RORY: Hey.

1402
01:11:58,882 --> 01:12:00,617
Shane?

1403
01:12:00,717 --> 01:12:04,654
Hey, uh, Shane, I got
something for you.

1404
01:12:04,754 --> 01:12:05,655
Check it out.

1405
01:12:08,692 --> 01:12:10,527
-Wow.

1406
01:12:10,627 --> 01:12:13,229
Thanks, Rory.

1407
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:14,998
RORY: So I'm all paid up.

1408
01:12:15,098 --> 01:12:17,434
You know, I've got to
lay low because my mom,

1409
01:12:17,534 --> 01:12:18,802
you know, she's going to flip.

1410
01:12:22,572 --> 01:12:25,241
-Right.

1411
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:28,011
-So, uh, it's cool for me
to hangout with you guys?

1412
01:12:28,111 --> 01:12:29,613
SHANE CARVERY: You know,
I'd give all this money

1413
01:12:29,713 --> 01:12:31,981
back for a decent
fire right now.

1414
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:33,983
Wouldn't you, Munn?

1415
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:34,784
-Yeah.

1416
01:12:34,884 --> 01:12:36,185
SHANE CARVERY: Kyle?

1417
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:38,321
-Yeah, it's cold.

1418
01:12:38,422 --> 01:12:39,756
I think I'm-- I'm gonna--

1419
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:41,991
SHANE CARVERY: No, let's get
a fire going so we can party.

1420
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:44,794
People will start
showing up, right?

1421
01:12:44,894 --> 01:12:47,597
Hey.

1422
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:52,736
Think you can get us a fire
going, and make it burn,

1423
01:12:52,836 --> 01:12:54,037
make it burn like hell?

1424
01:12:54,137 --> 01:12:55,138
RORY: Yeah.
SHANE CARVERY: Yeah?

1425
01:12:55,238 --> 01:12:56,339
-Yeah, I can do that.

1426
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,140
I can make a fire.
SHANE CARVERY: Big motherfucker?

1427
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,408
-Yeah.

1428
01:12:58,508 --> 01:13:00,577
SHANE CARVERY:
I'll tell you what.

1429
01:13:00,677 --> 01:13:04,080
If you get us a fire going--
a nice fire going-- I'll

1430
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:09,252
give you your tattoo tonight.

1431
01:13:09,352 --> 01:13:11,821
-Oh, serious?

1432
01:13:11,921 --> 01:13:13,590
SHANE CARVERY: Serious.

1433
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:15,091
-Oh, shit!

1434
01:13:15,191 --> 01:13:15,892
Hah!

1435
01:13:15,992 --> 01:13:17,360
No way, really?

1436
01:13:17,461 --> 01:13:18,528
I'm going to get the tattoo?

1437
01:13:18,628 --> 01:13:19,362
SHANE CARVERY: I said if.

1438
01:13:19,463 --> 01:13:20,630
-Oh, I know.

1439
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:21,765
Shane, I know.

1440
01:13:21,865 --> 01:13:25,368
I saw a good statue of
wood like, uh, 20 feet--

1441
01:13:25,469 --> 01:13:26,302
SHANE CARVERY: Shut up.

1442
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:27,136
RORY: Uh-huh.

1443
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:28,805
OK, I'm gonna-- here I go.

1444
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,840
I'm going to get my tattoo done.

1445
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:32,509
I'm going to get my tattoo done.

1446
01:13:32,609 --> 01:13:33,309

[laughing]

1448
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:42,151
That whole damn
cub scout thing was

1449
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:45,955
worth it just for that, man.

1450
01:13:46,055 --> 01:13:49,025
SHANE CARVERY:
Congratulations, dude.

1451
01:13:49,125 --> 01:13:51,360

Oh, wow.

1453
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:54,063
Oh.

01:13:54,163 --> 01:13:55,431
Oh.

1455
01:13:55,532 --> 01:13:57,400
SHANE CARVERY: Ready for your
initiation and your tattoo?

1456
01:13:57,501 --> 01:13:58,835
RORY: Really?

1457
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:00,537
I'm a Black Circle Boy now?

1458
01:14:00,637 --> 01:14:02,105
SHANE CARVERY: Not yet.

1459
01:14:02,205 --> 01:14:03,306
-Right.

1460
01:14:03,406 --> 01:14:05,609

Come to me.

It's OK.

1465
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:17,153
Take off your jacket.

1466
01:14:17,253 --> 01:14:19,155
RORY: OK.

1467
01:14:19,255 --> 01:14:21,625

1468
01:14:21,725 --> 01:14:24,894
And your pants.

1469
01:14:24,994 --> 01:14:28,765
Now I want you to stand
here before the father.

1470
01:14:28,865 --> 01:14:30,233
-That's it.

1471
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:31,334
Come on.

RORY: Yeah, shut up, Kyle.

1475
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:39,142

I want you to kneel.

want you to show me

1480
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:51,087
just how much you
love the father.

1481

Say you love the father.

01:14:52,756 --> 01:14:53,790

KYLE SULLIVAN: Oh, come on, man.

1485
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:58,795
He paid you your money.

1486
01:14:58,895 --> 01:15:00,496

1487
01:15:00,597 --> 01:15:01,330

That's it.

1491
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:06,936

-Shane, leave him alone!

1496
01:15:11,641 --> 01:15:12,341
-That's it.

1497
01:15:12,441 --> 01:15:13,142
Say it again.

1509
01:15:25,755 --> 01:15:26,455
-Leave him alone.

1510
01:15:26,556 --> 01:15:27,991

Now you get your tattoo.

1520
01:15:42,572 --> 01:15:44,440
-No!

1521
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:45,842

and this is the shit I get.

1531
01:16:30,353 --> 01:16:35,524
Now we're brothers
in murder, Kyle,

1532
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:38,662
because that's how
much I love you.

1533
01:16:38,762 --> 01:16:41,064

-Yeah, I think I'm
going to go home.

1542
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:17,560
-Do you want a ride?

1543
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:18,494
I have the car today.

1544
01:18:21,931 --> 01:18:23,266
-No.

1545
01:18:23,366 --> 01:18:24,934

-Wow.

1552

KYLE SULLIVAN: No thanks.

01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:25,561
SHANE CARVER: We
came by to say hi.

1560
01:19:25,661 --> 01:19:28,898
You haven't been around.

1561
01:19:28,998 --> 01:19:30,233
-I've been sick.

1562
01:19:32,902 --> 01:19:35,738
-Yeah, and I've been living
in an abandoned car tucked

1563
01:19:35,839 --> 01:19:38,107
underneath the freeway overpass.

1564
01:19:38,207 --> 01:19:39,675
You should stop by sometime.

1565
01:19:44,747 --> 01:19:45,915
-Nobody knows about Rory.

1566
01:19:46,015 --> 01:19:46,715
-That's right.

1567
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,823
Do you intend to do
something about it?

1568
01:19:53,923 --> 01:19:54,623
-No way.

1569
01:19:54,723 --> 01:19:55,925
-Hm?

1570
01:19:56,025 --> 01:19:59,128
-His mom thinks he ran away.

1571
01:19:59,228 --> 01:20:03,332
-Because if one of us
goes down, we all go down.

1572
01:20:03,432 --> 01:20:05,969
It's like all or nothing.

1573
01:20:06,069 --> 01:20:08,371
We get busted, we hang up.

1574
01:20:13,309 --> 01:20:14,677
It's like a pact, right?

1575
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:20,016
But what I'm saying is
it looks really good.

1576
01:20:23,352 --> 01:20:25,388
I think we're going
to be totally cool.

1577
01:20:29,425 --> 01:20:30,326
-You guys done eating?

1578
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:35,398
-Yeah.

1579
01:20:35,498 --> 01:20:36,765
Yeah, it was really good.

1580
01:20:36,866 --> 01:20:38,868
Thank you very much.

1581
01:20:38,968 --> 01:20:41,304
-Good.

1582
01:20:41,404 --> 01:20:44,707
Now get the fuck
out of my house.

1583
01:20:44,807 --> 01:20:47,176
[laughing]

1584
01:21:39,362 --> 01:21:40,229
KYLE SULLIVAN: Yeah.

1585
01:21:40,329 --> 01:21:42,565
Look, there's this kid.

1586
01:21:42,665 --> 01:21:44,968
Nobody gives a shit.

1587
01:21:45,068 --> 01:21:46,669
His name is Rory Leary.

1588
01:21:46,769 --> 01:21:50,373
And he was murdered.

1589
01:21:50,473 --> 01:21:54,777
Uh, I was there.

1590
01:21:54,877 --> 01:21:55,811
About a week ago.

1591
01:21:59,582 --> 01:22:01,217
You said you wanted
Shane Carver?

1592
01:22:01,317 --> 01:22:04,853
Well, you can have him.

1593
01:22:04,954 --> 01:22:07,190
I'll be down there in an hour.

1594
01:22:15,965 --> 01:22:16,632
Hi.

1595
01:22:16,732 --> 01:22:18,067
Can I talk to Chloe, please?

1596
01:22:21,137 --> 01:22:21,837
Thanks.

1597
01:22:39,388 --> 01:22:42,225
-Everything you saw,
exactly as you remember it.

1598
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:50,199
I think we can work
real well with this.

-Tell him what you
told me [inaudible].

1603
01:23:08,751 --> 01:23:14,890
-Kyle, do you know what it means
legally to be offered a deal?

1604
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:18,794
-Just from like "NYPD
Blue" and stuff.

1605
01:23:18,894 --> 01:23:21,164
Now the detectives are going to
want to take you onto the crime

1606
01:23:21,264 --> 01:23:25,134
scene, locate the body, get a
general idea of what happened.

1607
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:35,378
KYLE SULLIVAN: It
happened right over here.

1608
01:23:40,316 --> 01:23:41,050
Yeah.

1609
01:23:41,150 --> 01:23:42,585
I see some bottles and stuff.

1610
01:23:42,685 --> 01:23:45,921
KYLE SULLIVAN: And there
was a-- a line [inaudible].

1611
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:49,292
It led over there where he is.

1612
01:23:52,295 --> 01:23:57,700
Uh, he-- he was right there.

1613
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,068
He was.

1614
01:23:59,168 --> 01:24:02,405

around this area, all right?

DETECTIVE RAY (ON PHONE): Kyle?

Sherman Ray.

1621
01:24:13,549 --> 01:24:17,953
Is it true you were
doing hallucinogens?

1622
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:19,355
-What?

1623
01:24:19,455 --> 01:24:20,823
DETECTIVE RAY (ON PHONE): Is it
possible there was no murder?

1624
01:24:20,923 --> 01:24:25,328
That Shane and others
were trying to scare you?

1625
01:24:25,428 --> 01:24:27,863
-Wait.

1626
01:24:27,963 --> 01:24:29,298
Hold on a second.

1627
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,334
DETECTIVE RAY (ON PHONE): I'd
say it was a bunch of bullshit,

1628
01:24:31,434 --> 01:24:33,769
but we can't find
anything at the scene.

1629
01:24:33,869 --> 01:24:34,703
No blood or anything.

1630
01:24:34,803 --> 01:24:37,140
No clothing.

1631
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:39,175
They're saying that they were
playing some kind of trick

1632
01:24:39,275 --> 01:24:40,309
on you.

1633
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:41,910
And you were under the
influence of Mescaline,

1634
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:43,546
which made you
think it happened.

1635
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:48,484
-Do you believe him?

1636
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:50,386
DETECTIVE RAY (ON PHONE): It
doesn't really matter, Kyle.

1637
01:24:50,486 --> 01:24:52,421
There's no physical evidence.

1638
01:24:52,521 --> 01:24:56,392
Rory's parents are convinced
that he's run off to Seattle.

1639
01:24:56,492 --> 01:24:58,927
He took money from them.

1640
01:24:59,027 --> 01:25:00,329
Carver and Munn have
confirmed that he

1641
01:25:00,429 --> 01:25:03,832
left for Seattle last night.

1642
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:06,034
-That money was
to pay back Shane.

1643
01:25:06,135 --> 01:25:08,237
DETECTIVE RAY (ON PHONE): Their
lawyers are raising a stink.

1644
01:25:08,337 --> 01:25:09,472
[sigh]

1645
01:25:09,572 --> 01:25:13,509
We had to let them go until
we have something more.

1646
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:14,677
-You let him go?

1647
01:25:14,777 --> 01:25:15,978
DETECTIVE RAY (ON PHONE):
A couple hours ago.

1648
01:25:23,018 --> 01:25:25,421
[dial tone]

1649
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:34,397
[busy signal]

1650
01:25:34,497 --> 01:25:37,065
-Fuck!

1651
01:25:37,166 --> 01:25:37,833
[tires screeching]

1652
01:25:37,933 --> 01:25:38,834
Oh, fuck!

1653
01:26:08,831 --> 01:26:10,833
-Now try to move.

1654
01:26:10,933 --> 01:26:13,902
It won't feel too good.

1655
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:19,007
Kyle, Shane is your brother in
the power of the circle of sin.

1656
01:26:19,107 --> 01:26:23,011
If you condemn him, that is
a crime punishable by death.

1657
01:26:23,111 --> 01:26:27,082
Do you understand that
somebody will have to kill you?

1658
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:28,384
Good.

1659
01:26:28,484 --> 01:26:31,954
See, I'd kill you myself,
but I have no intention

1660
01:26:32,054 --> 01:26:34,457
on going to jail
for Shane Carver.

1661
01:26:34,557 --> 01:26:36,425
Besides--

1662
01:26:36,525 --> 01:26:37,260
[chuckling]

1663
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:40,263
I like you.

1664
01:26:40,363 --> 01:26:41,697
But see?

1665
01:26:41,797 --> 01:26:43,566
Shane doesn't like you anymore.

1666
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:45,801
And whether he's in
jail or out of jail

1667
01:26:45,901 --> 01:26:48,036
he will find
someone to kill you.

1668
01:26:48,136 --> 01:26:49,338
[sniffing]

1669
01:26:49,438 --> 01:26:52,140
I suggest that we,
uh, just remember

1670
01:26:52,241 --> 01:26:54,109
that this whole thing
was just a little prank.

1671
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:54,910
[gulp]

1672
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:57,246
OK?

1673
01:26:57,346 --> 01:26:58,881
Is that clear?

1674
01:26:58,981 --> 01:26:59,648
[gulp]

1675
01:26:59,748 --> 01:27:01,116
[sobbing]

1676
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:02,785
-Is that clear, you little fuck?

1677
01:27:02,885 --> 01:27:03,586
Huh?

1678
01:27:06,855 --> 01:27:12,395
The way I fucked your little
girlfriend after I killed her.

1679
01:27:12,495 --> 01:27:15,298
Did you ever fuck
a dead girl, huh?

1680
01:27:15,398 --> 01:27:17,900
Piece of shit!

1681
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,435
[scream]

1682
01:27:19,535 --> 01:27:21,203
[laughing]

1683
01:27:45,127 --> 01:27:46,895
-You're alive?

1684
01:27:46,995 --> 01:27:47,696
-You're alive.

1685
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:56,839
-Will you hand me the phone?

1686
01:27:56,939 --> 01:27:59,875
-You should just rest.

1687
01:27:59,975 --> 01:28:01,310
-Give me the phone.

1688
01:28:08,551 --> 01:28:09,251
Thanks.

1689
01:28:19,662 --> 01:28:20,363
-Hi.

1690
01:28:20,463 --> 01:28:21,397
Detective Ray, please?

1691
01:28:26,034 --> 01:28:27,269
Hey, it's Kyle Sullivan.

1692
01:28:30,573 --> 01:28:33,742
I think they were right
about the whole thing.

1693
01:28:33,842 --> 01:28:35,310
I think they set
me up for a prank.

1694
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:39,782
No, really.

1695
01:28:39,882 --> 01:28:43,352
I, uh-- I think it was a prank.

1696
01:28:46,855 --> 01:28:48,557
No, no.

1697
01:28:48,657 --> 01:28:51,326
No, look, I-- I
don't want your deal.

1698
01:28:51,427 --> 01:28:52,661
OK, forget it.

1699
01:28:58,634 --> 01:28:59,968
SHANE CARVER: Munn,
what are you thinking?

1700
01:29:00,068 --> 01:29:00,769
-Nothing.

1701
01:29:00,869 --> 01:29:01,570
Just shit.

1702
01:29:04,407 --> 01:29:07,943
-I know what you're
thinking about.

1703
01:29:08,043 --> 01:29:10,546
-What?

1704
01:29:10,646 --> 01:29:13,749
-All the shit you
said to the detective.

1705
01:29:13,849 --> 01:29:15,851
All the shit you're going to
say to him when he fucking pulls

1706
01:29:15,951 --> 01:29:19,622
you in again for
questioning, huh?

1707
01:29:19,722 --> 01:29:22,725
I-- I didn't say a
fucking word, Shane.

1708
01:29:22,825 --> 01:29:25,360
I--if I did, they'd have our
asses locked up right now.

1709
01:29:25,461 --> 01:29:26,962
-He told me about some
of the shit you said.

1710
01:29:27,062 --> 01:29:29,264
About how I'm the
fucking leader.

1711
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:32,300
About how you do whatever I say.

1712
01:29:32,401 --> 01:29:33,636
All kinds of shit.

1713
01:29:33,736 --> 01:29:35,838
You going to give me up, Munn?

1714
01:29:35,938 --> 01:29:38,474
Would you do that to me?

1715
01:29:38,574 --> 01:29:41,009
-Fuck you!

1716
01:29:41,109 --> 01:29:41,877
Man, Shane, I--

1717
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:52,821
-Hey.

1718
01:29:52,921 --> 01:29:56,692
I'm just checking.

1719
01:29:56,792 --> 01:29:59,061
You wouldn't lie
to me, would you?

1720
01:29:59,161 --> 01:30:00,929
You're a good fucking
soldier, aren't you?

1721
01:30:01,029 --> 01:30:02,865
-I'm a good soldier.

1722
01:30:02,965 --> 01:30:03,699
-That's right.

1723
01:30:03,799 --> 01:30:05,000
You're the fucking best, man.

1724
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:06,569
You're a fucking
go bot, aren't you?

1725
01:30:06,669 --> 01:30:07,002
-Yeah.

1726
01:30:07,102 --> 01:30:07,402
-Huh?

1727
01:30:07,503 --> 01:30:08,203
-Yeah.

1728
01:30:10,473 --> 01:30:12,407
-Let's go get high.

1729
01:30:12,508 --> 01:30:13,909
[chuckle]

1730
01:30:40,636 --> 01:30:42,004
-What are you thinking?

1731
01:30:51,046 --> 01:30:54,282
-He's got no special powers.

1732
01:30:54,382 --> 01:30:55,083
CHLOE: Who?

1733
01:30:55,183 --> 01:30:55,584
Shane?

1734
01:30:55,684 --> 01:30:56,519
-Shane.

1735
01:30:56,619 --> 01:30:57,319
[chuckling]

1736
01:30:57,419 --> 01:30:59,354
He's got no special powers.

1737
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:00,188
CHLOE: Come on, Kyle.

1738
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:01,323
He's just a stupid headbanger.

1739
01:31:08,631 --> 01:31:10,298
What are you doing?

1740
01:31:10,398 --> 01:31:11,800
KYLE SULLIVAN: I'm
going in the water.

1741
01:32:08,891 --> 01:32:09,592
-Oh.

1742
01:32:33,248 --> 01:32:34,149
Oh, Jesus.

1743
01:32:40,823 --> 01:32:41,724
Oh, Jesus.

1744
01:32:45,728 --> 01:32:47,462
[sobbing]

1745
01:33:14,389 --> 01:33:17,559
SHANE CARVER: You just don't
fucking get it, do you?

1746
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:21,697
You don't fucking get it.

1747
01:33:25,467 --> 01:33:30,138
I had to kill them,
you stupid fuck.

1748
01:33:30,238 --> 01:33:32,074
You think I don't give a shit?

1749
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:40,548
You think you're the
only one who cares?

1750
01:33:40,649 --> 01:33:43,852
Do you?

1751
01:33:43,952 --> 01:33:47,155
[sobbing]

1752
01:33:47,255 --> 01:33:49,491
KYLE SULLIVAN: Are you
going to kill me now?

01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:53,161
[sniffing]

1754
01:33:53,261 --> 01:34:01,136
SHANE CARVER: I-- I--
I don't know, Kyle.

1755
01:34:01,236 --> 01:34:07,542
I don't-- oh--- I don't-- yes.

1756
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:10,913
Yes, I'm going to kill you.

1757
01:34:11,013 --> 01:34:14,482
Then we can be together
forever, all of us.

1758
01:34:20,789 --> 01:34:27,595
I did this to protect all of
us, every single one of us,

1759
01:34:27,696 --> 01:34:31,599
the brotherhood,
the brotherhood.

1760
01:34:35,503 --> 01:34:36,204
-I know.

1761
01:34:41,476 --> 01:34:43,178
It's OK.

1762
01:34:43,278 --> 01:34:44,146
It's OK.

1763
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:50,285
I-- I totally understand.

1764
01:34:50,385 --> 01:34:55,724
I-- those motherfuckers
were weak.

1765
01:35:00,162 --> 01:35:03,231
SHANE CARVER: They
were, they were, were.

1766
01:35:06,835 --> 01:35:09,371
But you fucked up, too, Kyle.

1767
01:35:09,471 --> 01:35:12,875
You fucked up.

1768
01:35:12,975 --> 01:35:13,876
-I did.

1769
01:35:16,945 --> 01:35:18,280
SHANE CARVER: G-- oh!

1770
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:19,081
Oh!

1771
01:35:22,084 --> 01:35:25,387
You were just like Ronnie.

1772
01:35:25,487 --> 01:35:27,555
You were just like
my real brother!

1773
01:35:30,392 --> 01:35:31,659
And you fucking betrayed me.

1774
01:35:35,330 --> 01:35:42,805
-I just-- want-- I just-- I
wasn't as strong as you are.

1775
01:35:42,905 --> 01:35:45,307
SHANE CARVER: You didn't
understand that they had

1776
01:35:45,407 --> 01:35:56,184
an obligation to the brother, to
the father, to the father, to--

1777
01:35:56,284 --> 01:35:57,652
KYLE SULLIVAN: To the father.

1778
01:36:00,622 --> 01:36:01,323
-Blood oath.

1779
01:36:13,035 --> 01:36:15,871

Hey, you broke my fucking nose.

1784
01:37:03,285 --> 01:37:03,986
Ugh.

1785
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:18,166

[groaning]

1787
01:37:40,755 --> 01:37:44,692
KYLE SULLIVAN: It's
Rory, and Munn.

01:37:48,663 --> 01:37:49,397
It's Rory.

1789
01:37:54,436 --> 01:37:55,137
