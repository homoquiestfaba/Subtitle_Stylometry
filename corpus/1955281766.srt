1
00:00:00,029 --> 00:00:02,529
(eerie music)

2
00:02:33,215 --> 00:02:36,215
[Voiceover] His name was Jack Deth

3
00:02:41,526 --> 00:02:44,434
of the Zar Warrior from another dimension.

4
00:02:44,434 --> 00:02:46,184
A world called Earth.

5
00:02:47,087 --> 00:02:49,140
Things have changed
a little around here.

6
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,973
Doctor Lyra Sirrell.

7
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:53,607
Jack Shit, isn't it?

8
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:55,616
[Voiceover] Where women
do not know their place.

9
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,242
An RBG-7.

10
00:02:57,242 --> 00:02:58,720
[Voiceover] And weapons are developed

11
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,435
by an arcane discipline.

12
00:03:00,435 --> 00:03:02,160
The long second watch.

13
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,289
[Voiceover] Called science.

14
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:06,122
Multi-purpose blade.

15
00:03:07,722 --> 00:03:11,206
So where the hell you
sending me this time?

16
00:03:11,206 --> 00:03:14,528
Point of origin seems
to be Topeka, Kansas.

17
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,804
I wish I could give you a
better idea of what to expect.

18
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:19,810
(electric currents)

19
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:20,825
Jack!

20
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:21,908
Jack, you all right?

21
00:03:21,908 --> 00:03:23,541
(suspenseful music)

22
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,618
[Voiceover] This science
also created a device

23
00:03:25,618 --> 00:03:29,576
that brought Jack Death
to our world, Orpheus.

24
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:33,076
A world that has no use for this, science.

25
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:37,280
A world where magic rules.

26
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,363
Magic and us.

27
00:03:40,322 --> 00:03:43,472
We are the nobles, the Trancers,

28
00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:47,176
and our undisputed and feared monarch

29
00:03:47,176 --> 00:03:51,025
is Lord Caliban, who nicknamed Jack Deth...

30
00:03:51,025 --> 00:03:51,858
Me?

31
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:52,691
[Voiceover] Wolf's Head.

32
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,524
I will capture this Wolf's Head.

33
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:58,809
[Voiceover] Jack Deth quickly

34
00:03:58,809 --> 00:04:01,602
met many denizens of our land.

35
00:04:01,602 --> 00:04:02,435
Oh shit.

36
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:05,198
Something tells me I'm not in Kansas.

37
00:04:05,198 --> 00:04:06,912
(explosion)

38
00:04:06,912 --> 00:04:09,021
What the hell are you doing here?

39
00:04:09,021 --> 00:04:10,433
(explosion)

40
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:12,499
[Voiceover] Some familiar to him.

41
00:04:12,499 --> 00:04:13,498
Trancer.

42
00:04:13,498 --> 00:04:16,892
[Voiceover] And some new faces.

43
00:04:16,892 --> 00:04:18,246
This is not a dream.

44
00:04:18,246 --> 00:04:19,954
I think not.

45
00:04:19,954 --> 00:04:22,253
(grunts and yelling)

46
00:04:22,253 --> 00:04:23,836
Where the hell am I?

47
00:04:23,836 --> 00:04:26,306
This place is called Orpheus.

48
00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:29,762
[Voiceover] And when he came
into conflict with the nobles

49
00:04:29,762 --> 00:04:31,884
the Wolf's Head drew first blood.

50
00:04:31,884 --> 00:04:34,634
(dramatic music)

51
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:42,152
Caliban actually seemed
to admire this stranger.

52
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,897
He's got a respect for you.

53
00:04:45,897 --> 00:04:48,559
I have a great deal to offer you.

54
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:49,852
(smacks)

55
00:04:49,852 --> 00:04:52,004
[Voiceover] This interloper.

56
00:04:52,004 --> 00:04:54,148
(grunting)

57
00:04:54,148 --> 00:04:57,048
Caliban felt that the
Trancer nobles of Orpheus

58
00:04:57,048 --> 00:05:00,405
had become lazy, and that Jack Deth

59
00:05:00,405 --> 00:05:05,188
with his bizarre manner
and other worldly weapons

60
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:08,123
would present a challenge.

61
00:05:08,123 --> 00:05:11,540
Is this some bizarre attempt at levity?

62
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:17,069
[Voiceover] But even
Caliban was fallible.

63
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:19,225
He had not anticipated resistance

64
00:05:19,225 --> 00:05:21,475
from his own son, Prospero.

65
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:25,685
(suspenseful music)

66
00:05:29,402 --> 00:05:32,495
Nor from Shaleen, the bitch leader

67
00:05:32,495 --> 00:05:35,870
of the rebellious peasants
called Tunnel Rats.

68
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,427
No.

69
00:05:37,427 --> 00:05:39,172
He's not like the others.

70
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,757
I cannot do this, father.

71
00:05:41,757 --> 00:05:42,590
I will not.

72
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,507
(foreboding music)

73
00:05:46,678 --> 00:05:50,678
[Voiceover] Was Jack
Deth some sort of savior?

74
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:57,687
The Tunnel Rats certainly
came to believe so.

75
00:05:57,687 --> 00:06:00,586
This man can put an
end to our nightmare.

76
00:06:00,586 --> 00:06:02,586
I have seen it coming.

77
00:06:03,714 --> 00:06:05,994
We must find him.

78
00:06:05,994 --> 00:06:07,290
(blade slicing)

79
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,024
[Voiceover] We must hurry!

80
00:06:09,024 --> 00:06:11,266
[Voiceover] Those little
rodents had the gall

81
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:15,433
to sneak into our midst after
we had captured Jack Deth.

82
00:06:17,914 --> 00:06:19,288
(weapons clashing)

83
00:06:19,288 --> 00:06:23,455
Prospero insanely chose
to ally himself with them.

84
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:26,138
(planks falling)

85
00:06:26,138 --> 00:06:28,181
There's no way out of this place.

86
00:06:28,181 --> 00:06:31,703
[Voiceover] And together,
they narrowly escaped.

87
00:06:31,703 --> 00:06:34,453
(dramatic music)

88
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,056
We gotta work fast.

89
00:06:38,056 --> 00:06:40,422
[Voiceover] It did not take us long

90
00:06:40,422 --> 00:06:43,123
to track them to their hiding places.

91
00:06:43,123 --> 00:06:45,872
(speech drowned out by music)

92
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:46,705
There!

93
00:06:46,705 --> 00:06:48,195
(mumbles) there much time.

94
00:06:48,195 --> 00:06:49,987
Find 'em and kill them.

95
00:06:49,987 --> 00:06:52,939
[Voiceover] The battle
was swift and brutal.

96
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:55,925
Far more so than we might have expected.

97
00:06:55,925 --> 00:06:59,698
It seemed that Jack Deth had
indeed given the Tunnel Rats

98
00:06:59,698 --> 00:07:03,281
that which they had
never before possessed.

99
00:07:04,817 --> 00:07:05,650
Hope.

100
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,938
(swords clanking)

101
00:07:06,938 --> 00:07:10,976
We suffered many casualties,
and I Lucius felt the sting

102
00:07:10,976 --> 00:07:12,727
of the damnable Shaleen.

103
00:07:12,727 --> 00:07:13,647
Jack!

104
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:16,074
[Voiceover] As the
Caliban, he fell victim

105
00:07:16,074 --> 00:07:18,742
to a cowardly assault by the Wolf's Head.

106
00:07:18,742 --> 00:07:22,909
Aided by the power of a long
dead wizard named Oberon.

107
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:26,832
Sorry, father.

108
00:07:26,832 --> 00:07:29,832
(suspenseful music)

109
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,103
I have no son!

110
00:07:38,432 --> 00:07:39,813
[Voiceover] Now, after a month

111
00:07:39,813 --> 00:07:43,302
of their strike and run tactics,

112
00:07:43,302 --> 00:07:44,135
Oh!

113
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,086
[Voiceover] Picking us off one by one.

114
00:07:48,086 --> 00:07:49,688
(yelling)

115
00:07:49,688 --> 00:07:50,993
(grunts)

116
00:07:50,993 --> 00:07:53,517
The Tunnel Rats, led by Jack Deth

117
00:07:53,517 --> 00:07:57,475
have mounted an offensive at
the heart of power itself.

118
00:07:57,475 --> 00:08:00,558
They strike at the castle of Caliban.

119
00:08:03,372 --> 00:08:05,964
(grunting and yelling)
(exciting music)

120
00:08:05,964 --> 00:08:08,797
(swords clanking)

121
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:18,549
Deth is coming!

122
00:08:18,549 --> 00:08:19,870
Deth is, ah!

123
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,870
(suspenseful music)

124
00:08:27,443 --> 00:08:28,513
(weapon fires)

125
00:08:28,513 --> 00:08:29,880
Oh!

126
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,047
(yelling)

127
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:35,016
(grunts)

128
00:08:36,373 --> 00:08:39,706
(grunting and smacking)

129
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,817
(yelling)

130
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:50,212
Hey, how you holding up?

131
00:08:50,212 --> 00:08:52,663
[Shaleen] Get down!

132
00:08:52,663 --> 00:08:54,363
(arrow fires)

133
00:08:54,363 --> 00:08:55,467
(sword stabs)

134
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:58,217
(dramatic music)

135
00:09:02,802 --> 00:09:03,635
Prospero.

136
00:09:05,307 --> 00:09:06,140
(arrow fires)

137
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,223
(grunts)

138
00:09:10,112 --> 00:09:12,755
Steal these bastards.

139
00:09:12,755 --> 00:09:14,922
(yelling)

140
00:09:21,117 --> 00:09:23,617
(eerie music)

141
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,790
(cutting fabric)

142
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:06,144
Ah!

143
00:10:06,144 --> 00:10:08,399
(arrow fires)

144
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,232
Ah!

145
00:10:10,197 --> 00:10:11,855
Lucius.

146
00:10:11,855 --> 00:10:15,106
Celia, I had this horrible dream.

147
00:10:15,106 --> 00:10:18,511
We were driven from the
castle by those peasants

148
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:21,094
and some mad man, Jack Deth.

149
00:10:21,094 --> 00:10:22,927
And the few of us who survive...

150
00:10:22,927 --> 00:10:25,344
Escaped, and are in hiding.

151
00:10:26,316 --> 00:10:28,899
(somber music)

152
00:10:52,626 --> 00:10:53,793
Not a dream.

153
00:10:54,766 --> 00:10:55,599
No.

154
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,333
Have this, it's good.

155
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,833
It's good for you.

156
00:11:14,739 --> 00:11:15,637
It's fine.

157
00:11:15,637 --> 00:11:16,823
It's very good for you, Jack.

158
00:11:16,823 --> 00:11:17,865
That's great, that's fine.

159
00:11:17,865 --> 00:11:18,698
Just have one.

160
00:11:18,698 --> 00:11:20,031
That's enough!

161
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,790
Okay, don't start that.

162
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,623
Don't start with that.

163
00:11:32,795 --> 00:11:34,628
Is this better Jack?

164
00:11:38,984 --> 00:11:41,294
Do you feel like smiling?

165
00:11:41,294 --> 00:11:42,978
If it would please you.

166
00:11:42,978 --> 00:11:44,895
God damn it, stop it!

167
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:48,294
Just do what pleases you.

168
00:11:48,294 --> 00:11:49,294
Not me, you.

169
00:11:51,695 --> 00:11:52,528
Jack.

170
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,738
Before you, I was just another slave

171
00:11:56,738 --> 00:11:58,867
in the home of Caliban.

172
00:11:58,867 --> 00:12:01,176
You changed all that.

173
00:12:01,176 --> 00:12:04,184
There was nothing more important
to me than pleasing you.

174
00:12:04,184 --> 00:12:05,684
You're like a God.

175
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,195
I'm not like a God.

176
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:10,386
You are the greatest
warrior who ever fought.

177
00:12:10,386 --> 00:12:11,234
That's ridiculous.

178
00:12:11,234 --> 00:12:14,317
Sexually, you're like a wild animal

179
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:18,304
who no living man can equal.

180
00:12:19,882 --> 00:12:20,965
Well, yeah.

181
00:12:26,905 --> 00:12:27,905
Jack Deth.

182
00:12:32,261 --> 00:12:33,761
You're trancing.

183
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:37,556
A strain from the fighting
has caught up with me.

184
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,556
I am sorry if I have frightened you.

185
00:12:41,703 --> 00:12:44,055
Are you saying I'm scared?

186
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,718
No, your weapon is saying that.

187
00:12:46,718 --> 00:12:48,825
If you wish to stand
about looking threatening,

188
00:12:48,825 --> 00:12:50,396
that is your privilege.

189
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:52,953
But if you are interested
in finding a way home,

190
00:12:52,953 --> 00:12:54,453
then come with me.

191
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:59,009
You may even bring your toy.

192
00:13:06,463 --> 00:13:09,213
(dramatic music)

193
00:13:39,507 --> 00:13:41,817
Any clue to crossing dimensional realms,

194
00:13:41,817 --> 00:13:44,400
is here in my father's library.

195
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:52,283
I offered to help, he wouldn't hear of it.

196
00:13:52,283 --> 00:13:54,908
(grunting)

197
00:13:54,908 --> 00:13:55,822
How bad?

198
00:13:55,822 --> 00:13:57,025
It is not your concern.

199
00:13:57,025 --> 00:13:57,858
How bad?

200
00:14:01,638 --> 00:14:03,761
Why are you doing this?

201
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:05,999
The first time you said it
was to make things even.

202
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:08,020
Why are you helping me now?

203
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:12,187
Because you've been
fighting side-by-side with us.

204
00:14:14,423 --> 00:14:17,840
The son of Caliban battling his own kind.

205
00:14:20,203 --> 00:14:22,536
You're a good man, Prospero.

206
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:27,941
You saw innocent people suffer,

207
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:32,728
and no one could do any more
than you have, to fight it.

208
00:14:32,728 --> 00:14:34,728
Now I see you suffering,

209
00:14:37,935 --> 00:14:39,685
and I can do no less.

210
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:06,889
Any form of physical contact will do.

211
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,042
Variety's nice.

212
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,900
(peaceful music)

213
00:16:05,373 --> 00:16:09,040
I don't want to fall in love with you.

214
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,123
Don't flatter yourself.

215
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:15,209
I need to rest a bit.

216
00:16:17,771 --> 00:16:18,854
Go help Jack.

217
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:24,456
He doesn't like to depend
on anyone, except himself.

218
00:16:26,222 --> 00:16:28,972
I'm sure you can understand that.

219
00:16:40,014 --> 00:16:43,847
I don't want to fall in
love with you, either.

220
00:16:49,928 --> 00:16:50,928
Jack Deth?

221
00:16:53,349 --> 00:16:54,242
(sighs)

222
00:16:54,242 --> 00:16:55,280
How are you doing?

223
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,530
Terrific, making tremendous progress.

224
00:17:17,501 --> 00:17:18,376
All right, okay.

225
00:17:18,376 --> 00:17:19,209
I give up.

226
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:21,434
What is this shit?

227
00:17:21,434 --> 00:17:25,351
Rhonic is a language
commonly used in a cult.

228
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,328
What, what is it?

229
00:17:31,392 --> 00:17:34,315
God, Jack, you've found it.

230
00:17:34,315 --> 00:17:35,452
This is it.

231
00:17:35,452 --> 00:17:39,324
Other worlds, other when's, other why's.

232
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:42,407
It is about inter-dimensional travel.

233
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:44,466
I knew that.

234
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,989
(whistles)

235
00:18:19,888 --> 00:18:21,471
I hunger, Lucius.

236
00:18:23,265 --> 00:18:25,297
I feel empty inside.

237
00:18:25,297 --> 00:18:26,544
I need meat.

238
00:18:26,544 --> 00:18:28,702
We all have the hunger.

239
00:18:28,702 --> 00:18:30,245
Lucius is trying to do his best.

240
00:18:30,245 --> 00:18:35,009
I hate those peasant bastards
as much as you do, Angelo.

241
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:37,890
The bitch leader took my eye.

242
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,737
And if I hadn't escaped
through Caliban's sanctum,

243
00:18:40,737 --> 00:18:41,848
she would've killed me.

244
00:18:41,848 --> 00:18:44,410
What were you doing at his sanctum?

245
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:47,443
Caliban has great powers.

246
00:18:47,443 --> 00:18:49,705
Did you get anything?

247
00:18:49,705 --> 00:18:50,538
Yes.

248
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:04,646
We are dead.

249
00:19:10,165 --> 00:19:12,116
Why did you get that thing?

250
00:19:12,116 --> 00:19:14,951
Lucius had a good reason.

251
00:19:14,951 --> 00:19:17,125
Why did you get that thing?

252
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,113
Something made me.

253
00:19:19,113 --> 00:19:20,530
I felt this need.

254
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,506
Nothing I can...

255
00:19:23,506 --> 00:19:26,506
(suspenseful music)

256
00:19:54,196 --> 00:19:56,196
You pathetic bastards.

257
00:20:03,581 --> 00:20:04,414
What?

258
00:20:04,414 --> 00:20:05,331
What is it?

259
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:07,966
I...

260
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:12,613
No, nothing.

261
00:20:12,613 --> 00:20:16,288
An odd feeling for a
moment, but is gone now.

262
00:20:16,288 --> 00:20:18,400
Well I wish you were gone now.

263
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,271
What does this Rhonic stuff say?

264
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:22,595
When you came here you arrived

265
00:20:22,595 --> 00:20:24,659
in some sort of machine, you said?

266
00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:25,676
A TCL chamber, yeah.

267
00:20:25,676 --> 00:20:27,636
Designed for crossing time and space.

268
00:20:27,636 --> 00:20:29,461
But the controls got smashed.

269
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,913
I must've jumped dimensions.

270
00:20:31,913 --> 00:20:33,330
How screwed am I?

271
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:37,272
The only known talisman
that will enable the user

272
00:20:37,272 --> 00:20:41,743
to master both time and
space is the timeand.

273
00:20:41,743 --> 00:20:43,704
Timeand sounds like diamond.

274
00:20:43,704 --> 00:20:46,848
A jewel about as big as your fist.

275
00:20:46,848 --> 00:20:47,765
Glitterine.

276
00:20:48,937 --> 00:20:51,770
It resides in the area of Orpheus,

277
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:55,442
called the heart of the storm.

278
00:20:55,442 --> 00:20:56,359
Right here.

279
00:20:57,701 --> 00:21:00,398
Whoever holds it can
open a dimensional vortex

280
00:21:00,398 --> 00:21:03,898
to any time, any place in the multi-verse.

281
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,314
But in order to get to the timeand,

282
00:21:06,314 --> 00:21:08,981
you must first enter and survive

283
00:21:10,093 --> 00:21:12,942
the castle of unrelenting terror.

284
00:21:12,942 --> 00:21:16,771
(chuckles) You gotta be kidding me.

285
00:21:16,771 --> 00:21:19,476
That is what it is called.

286
00:21:19,476 --> 00:21:22,059
Castle of unrelenting terror?

287
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:24,802
And I thought Cahuenga was a stupid name.

288
00:21:24,802 --> 00:21:28,469
And I thought Jack
Deth was a stupid name.

289
00:21:35,449 --> 00:21:37,381
So he thinks he can actually challenge

290
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:38,674
the heart of a storm?

291
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:39,898
Yes, he does.

292
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,965
Jack Deth, are you sure?

293
00:21:41,965 --> 00:21:42,798
Yeah I'm sure.

294
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:44,324
I just don't like to
leave a job unfinished.

295
00:21:44,324 --> 00:21:46,182
There's still Trancers
out there running around.

296
00:21:46,182 --> 00:21:47,384
We can fight them.

297
00:21:47,384 --> 00:21:48,828
Bull shit, and don't look so choked up.

298
00:21:48,828 --> 00:21:50,979
You can't wait for me to leave.

299
00:21:50,979 --> 00:21:52,881
I will admit I harbored
some hostility toward you

300
00:21:52,881 --> 00:21:56,267
when you first arrived, but
you've taught us a great deal.

301
00:21:56,267 --> 00:21:57,894
You will be missed.

302
00:21:57,894 --> 00:21:59,560
Not by me, of course.

303
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,534
We'll make sure you have
a horse, guide, provisions.

304
00:22:02,534 --> 00:22:03,989
Whatever you need.

305
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,066
Thanks a lot, Shaleen.

306
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:07,727
Safe journey, Jack Deth.

307
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:08,647
Jack Deth.

308
00:22:08,647 --> 00:22:09,480
Yeah.

309
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,256
Your name will be
taught to our children,

310
00:22:11,256 --> 00:22:13,589
and our children's children.

311
00:22:15,142 --> 00:22:15,975
Swell.

312
00:22:23,073 --> 00:22:24,768
It is true, then.

313
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,413
You are leaving.

314
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:27,829
This isn't my home.

315
00:22:27,829 --> 00:22:30,846
Hell, I don't even know
if I have a home anymore.

316
00:22:30,846 --> 00:22:32,013
This ain't it.

317
00:22:32,943 --> 00:22:34,860
I'll try harder.

318
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,910
(laughs) It's got
nothing to do with you.

319
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,558
Take me with you, then.

320
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:41,391
I can't.

321
00:22:43,717 --> 00:22:47,884
Jack, all I ask of you is
whatever you can give me.

322
00:22:49,885 --> 00:22:52,227
I'll never harass you.

323
00:22:52,227 --> 00:22:53,956
I'll be there when you want me to

324
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:56,918
and not there when you don't.

325
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:59,918
You could treat me any way you wish,

326
00:23:00,781 --> 00:23:04,198
and I'll never, ever refuse you anything.

327
00:23:05,787 --> 00:23:09,909
Is that not all you could ask of a woman?

328
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:10,742
Look.

329
00:23:12,132 --> 00:23:16,834
I told you about this other
liar where I come from.

330
00:23:16,834 --> 00:23:18,586
She's so different from
you, and in the brief time

331
00:23:18,586 --> 00:23:21,261
that I knew her, she made me crazy.

332
00:23:21,261 --> 00:23:23,213
This is a good thing?

333
00:23:23,213 --> 00:23:24,398
I didn't think so at the time,

334
00:23:24,398 --> 00:23:26,553
but I'm beginning to think
that a woman isn't a real woman

335
00:23:26,553 --> 00:23:29,010
unless she makes you want
to smack her in the chops.

336
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:32,828
And not doing it makes you a real man.

337
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:33,745
Look angel.

338
00:23:35,202 --> 00:23:36,521
You're never gonna be happy with anyone

339
00:23:36,521 --> 00:23:38,728
until you're happy with you.

340
00:23:38,728 --> 00:23:41,478
You gotta find that for yourself.

341
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,344
You're not gonna find that with me.

342
00:23:44,344 --> 00:23:47,094
(peaceful music)

343
00:23:56,547 --> 00:23:57,380
Jack?

344
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:03,649
Take this to remember me by.

345
00:24:07,602 --> 00:24:09,007
Thanks.

346
00:24:09,007 --> 00:24:10,076
[Lyra] Jack?

347
00:24:10,076 --> 00:24:10,909
Yeah.

348
00:24:12,165 --> 00:24:16,332
To find what you treasure,
reach deep into your heart.

349
00:24:18,126 --> 00:24:20,683
What does that mean?

350
00:24:20,683 --> 00:24:22,016
I do not know.

351
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:25,966
See you, Lyra.

352
00:24:34,407 --> 00:24:35,849
Hey.

353
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:36,932
You my guide?

354
00:24:39,641 --> 00:24:41,474
Now let's do it, then.

355
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:49,694
(dramatic music)

356
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:19,427
This heart of the storm
ain't so bad, is it Prospero?

357
00:25:22,392 --> 00:25:23,958
How did you know?

358
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:27,087
I got a knack for spotting Trancer scum.

359
00:25:27,087 --> 00:25:28,962
You are never going to
forgive the circumstances

360
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:30,712
of my birth, are you?

361
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,523
I'll be sleeping with one eye open.

362
00:25:36,594 --> 00:25:38,374
(horse call)

363
00:25:38,374 --> 00:25:41,291
(foreboding music)

364
00:25:43,698 --> 00:25:45,028
[Caliban] He will venture to the castle

365
00:25:45,028 --> 00:25:47,020
of unrelenting terror.

366
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,921
Are you certain, my lord?

367
00:25:49,921 --> 00:25:52,364
I am always certain, Lucius.

368
00:25:52,364 --> 00:25:53,197
Ha!

369
00:25:53,197 --> 00:25:56,780
Once you were certain
you'd kill Jack Deth.

370
00:25:58,255 --> 00:26:01,887
He will do it because
it's what I would do

371
00:26:01,887 --> 00:26:03,370
were I marooned.

372
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,149
(grunts)

373
00:26:05,149 --> 00:26:07,257
I would strive to get home.

374
00:26:07,257 --> 00:26:08,808
A time and at the heart of the storm.

375
00:26:08,808 --> 00:26:10,278
That is his only way home.

376
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:12,792
But my lord, how would he learn of it?

377
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:14,991
He is the kind of man
that would find out.

378
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:18,281
And I will not underestimate him again.

379
00:26:18,281 --> 00:26:21,335
Will we retake the castle, my lord?

380
00:26:21,335 --> 00:26:23,206
We're sorely outnumbered, Lucius.

381
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,248
And the Tunnel Rats are well-armed.

382
00:26:25,248 --> 00:26:26,958
Now you are here, my lord.

383
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:27,958
You're back.

384
00:26:29,483 --> 00:26:33,301
Your confidence is flattering, Celia.

385
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:36,634
But our salvation lies with the timeand.

386
00:26:38,165 --> 00:26:40,978
At the height of my power, I had no desire

387
00:26:40,978 --> 00:26:43,547
to challenge the castle
of unrelenting terror.

388
00:26:43,547 --> 00:26:46,494
But if Jack Deth dies in his attempt

389
00:26:46,494 --> 00:26:48,212
to retrieve the timeand,

390
00:26:48,212 --> 00:26:50,724
then we'll be rid of him forever.

391
00:26:50,724 --> 00:26:53,362
And if he succeeds, then he would've done

392
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,434
us a great service.

393
00:26:55,434 --> 00:26:59,705
A service for which I
will thank him profusely,

394
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:01,455
before I destroy him.

395
00:27:03,104 --> 00:27:06,021
(foreboding music)

396
00:27:13,557 --> 00:27:15,493
That flame-thrower of yours.

397
00:27:15,493 --> 00:27:18,502
It makes starting a
fire quite a bit easier.

398
00:27:18,502 --> 00:27:21,522
Actually, it's just a cigarette lighter.

399
00:27:21,522 --> 00:27:23,010
It's not supposed to do this.

400
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:25,510
(flame roars)

401
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:27,706
Jumping the dimensional gap

402
00:27:27,706 --> 00:27:31,006
caused the things I
brought with me to change.

403
00:27:31,006 --> 00:27:33,173
Not always for the better.

404
00:27:34,132 --> 00:27:36,551
This is a long second watch.

405
00:27:36,551 --> 00:27:38,541
In my world it's a terrific weapon.

406
00:27:38,541 --> 00:27:40,482
Slows the rest of the world down.

407
00:27:40,482 --> 00:27:44,087
I tried to use it here,
and it slowed me down.

408
00:27:44,087 --> 00:27:46,640
Left everybody else normal.

409
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,520
A pity.

410
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,511
A weapon like this would
useful at the castle of...

411
00:27:49,511 --> 00:27:50,629
Unrelenting terror.

412
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:51,546
Yeah right.

413
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,191
(spitting) This tastes like shit.

414
00:27:57,191 --> 00:27:58,691
How do you know?

415
00:28:01,154 --> 00:28:05,321
You got anything that's gonna
make this taste any better?

416
00:28:12,969 --> 00:28:14,831
And this will make the food taste better?

417
00:28:14,831 --> 00:28:18,331
No, but it will make you care much less.

418
00:28:22,246 --> 00:28:23,714
Not bad.

419
00:28:23,714 --> 00:28:25,161
Not bad at all.

420
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,856
(dog barking)

421
00:28:26,856 --> 00:28:28,073
No, stop.

422
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:30,573
(dog barking)

423
00:28:44,617 --> 00:28:46,709
I would've killed him.

424
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:49,626
Killing is not always the answer.

425
00:28:54,439 --> 00:28:57,356
It's usually a pretty good guess.

426
00:29:07,293 --> 00:29:11,460
So tell me, does anyone live
in this God forsaken place?

427
00:29:12,763 --> 00:29:15,906
[Prospero] There is talk
of the occasional refugee.

428
00:29:15,906 --> 00:29:17,978
The odd fugitive, or two.

429
00:29:17,978 --> 00:29:19,834
But I do not believe it.

430
00:29:19,834 --> 00:29:22,697
For anyone to live here,
they must be insane,

431
00:29:22,697 --> 00:29:25,215
or to be driven insane in no time.

432
00:29:25,215 --> 00:29:28,048
(expectant music)

433
00:29:33,529 --> 00:29:37,029
(moves into solemn music)

434
00:29:57,621 --> 00:29:59,871
(laughing)

435
00:30:04,281 --> 00:30:05,114
(dart fires)

436
00:30:05,114 --> 00:30:06,543
(horse whinnies)

437
00:30:06,543 --> 00:30:09,543
(suspenseful music)

438
00:30:25,922 --> 00:30:28,608
A noble, eh? (Laughs)

439
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,596
Your kind (speech drowned out by yelling)

440
00:30:30,596 --> 00:30:33,829
A nobly, obly-obly-obly-obly!

441
00:30:33,829 --> 00:30:37,079
(hitting and grunting)

442
00:30:50,304 --> 00:30:54,062
(breathing heavily) I'm
getting to old for this shit.

443
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:54,993
Meat!

444
00:30:54,993 --> 00:30:56,791
That's what you called us.

445
00:30:56,791 --> 00:30:57,981
Meat!

446
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,088
You took my lover, you did!

447
00:31:00,088 --> 00:31:02,752
Or maybe it was my child.

448
00:31:02,752 --> 00:31:05,219
You could've had your last meat!

449
00:31:05,219 --> 00:31:07,636
(struggling)

450
00:31:08,585 --> 00:31:10,407
(yelling)

451
00:31:10,407 --> 00:31:13,657
(growling and yelling)

452
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,077
Prospero, God damn, where the hell...

453
00:31:26,077 --> 00:31:27,836
Who's that guy?

454
00:31:27,836 --> 00:31:32,005
He wanted to kill me
because of what I am.

455
00:31:32,005 --> 00:31:33,750
Thank you, my friend.

456
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,083
(dog barks)

457
00:31:38,203 --> 00:31:41,299
Perhaps you can sympathize with him.

458
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,382
Shall we find the horses?

459
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:58,958
Jack Deth.

460
00:32:01,958 --> 00:32:05,005
It must be time for my watch by now.

461
00:32:05,005 --> 00:32:06,518
I'm fine.

462
00:32:06,518 --> 00:32:08,738
Go lie back down.

463
00:32:08,738 --> 00:32:11,772
Don't they rest on your world?

464
00:32:11,772 --> 00:32:12,950
I said I'm fine, damn it.

465
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,367
Go back to sleep.

466
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:22,010
You are afraid to let me take watch.

467
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,080
[Deth] Fuck you.

468
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,370
You are.

469
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,056
You are afraid.

470
00:32:26,056 --> 00:32:27,834
I'm not afraid of anyone,

471
00:32:27,834 --> 00:32:30,868
let alone a squid brain user like you.

472
00:32:30,868 --> 00:32:32,830
You think I am going to drain you dry

473
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:35,698
in your sleep, don't you?

474
00:32:35,698 --> 00:32:37,781
You still don't trust me.

475
00:32:38,785 --> 00:32:41,415
To you, there is good and there is bad,

476
00:32:41,415 --> 00:32:43,582
and there is nothing else.

477
00:32:46,016 --> 00:32:50,123
I have given up everything because I hated

478
00:32:50,123 --> 00:32:52,290
what my people were doing.

479
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,773
But you don't care.

480
00:32:57,157 --> 00:33:02,093
Nothing matters to you except
your single-minded hatred.

481
00:33:02,093 --> 00:33:05,321
And you don't want to
think of anyone who is,

482
00:33:05,321 --> 00:33:09,521
or was a Trancer as anything
other than sub-human

483
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:13,104
who deserve their fate,
and deserve to die.

484
00:33:14,488 --> 00:33:18,026
Because that simplifies
your job, doesn't it?

485
00:33:18,026 --> 00:33:20,431
It is easier to destroy the enemy

486
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:24,598
when they couldn't possibly
have any right to live.

487
00:33:42,114 --> 00:33:44,781
(ambient music)

488
00:33:47,513 --> 00:33:49,024
Why did you volunteer to be my guide?

489
00:33:49,024 --> 00:33:51,204
I'm the best qualified.

490
00:33:51,204 --> 00:33:52,485
Aren't you afraid you're gonna be away

491
00:33:52,485 --> 00:33:54,902
from your favorite food dish?

492
00:33:55,961 --> 00:33:56,794
Ah.

493
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:01,494
This is about Shaleen then, is it?

494
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,708
What, do you love her?

495
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:06,731
I don't love anybody.

496
00:34:06,731 --> 00:34:08,427
I just don't want to see her get hurt.

497
00:34:08,427 --> 00:34:09,677
Neither do I.

498
00:34:11,735 --> 00:34:13,630
I thought that this would
be a good opportunity

499
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:18,412
to put myself at a safe
distance from her for awhile.

500
00:34:18,412 --> 00:34:20,745
Until I figure this all out.

501
00:34:24,934 --> 00:34:27,075
I'll bet in your world
you can love someone

502
00:34:27,075 --> 00:34:31,288
and not worry that they might die from it.

503
00:34:31,288 --> 00:34:33,871
(solemn music)

504
00:34:38,431 --> 00:34:41,568
I'm gonna get some shut-eye.

505
00:34:41,568 --> 00:34:43,568
You take the next watch.

506
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:47,784
You try anything and I'll kill ya.

507
00:34:47,784 --> 00:34:50,284
I would expect nothing less.

508
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:10,572
(whimsical music)

509
00:35:48,465 --> 00:35:49,965
I saw something.

510
00:35:51,761 --> 00:35:53,867
I know, my child.

511
00:35:53,867 --> 00:35:54,700
I know.

512
00:36:04,014 --> 00:36:06,764
You have the gift, and the curse.

513
00:36:09,157 --> 00:36:12,490
You have not allowed yourself to use it,

514
00:36:13,441 --> 00:36:15,441
but now it is your time.

515
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:21,647
(foreboding music)

516
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,343
There.

517
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,410
The castle of unrelenting terror.

518
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:57,853
Swell.

519
00:38:09,382 --> 00:38:10,479
Now what?

520
00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:11,312
We pray.

521
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,083
I got your prayer right here.

522
00:38:20,294 --> 00:38:22,794
(eerie music)

523
00:38:37,488 --> 00:38:40,905
(moves into dance music)

524
00:38:47,387 --> 00:38:49,887
If this is unrelenting terror,

525
00:38:50,794 --> 00:38:53,211
I can't wait for total panic.

526
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:52,077
How long have I been here?

527
00:40:53,127 --> 00:40:54,044
Not long.

528
00:40:55,209 --> 00:40:56,376
Stay longer.

529
00:40:57,218 --> 00:40:58,301
Stay forever.

530
00:41:02,814 --> 00:41:03,647
Forever.

531
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:10,247
I guess (mumbles) wouldn't hurt.

532
00:41:24,222 --> 00:41:25,055
Jack!

533
00:41:27,221 --> 00:41:28,930
(giggling)

534
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:30,296
Jack!

535
00:41:30,296 --> 00:41:31,129
Jack!

536
00:41:32,473 --> 00:41:33,390
Look at me.

537
00:41:38,007 --> 00:41:39,340
I look so silly!

538
00:41:40,434 --> 00:41:41,684
Yeah, you do.

539
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:44,938
Reflection.

540
00:41:44,938 --> 00:41:48,326
I have always wanted to see myself.

541
00:41:48,326 --> 00:41:50,119
Isn't this wonderful?

542
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:53,202
Everything we want, forever and ever.

543
00:41:57,736 --> 00:41:58,819
I'm hungry.

544
00:42:00,387 --> 00:42:01,255
Don't be ridiculous.

545
00:42:01,255 --> 00:42:02,838
With all this food?

546
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:08,152
Wait a minute.

547
00:42:08,152 --> 00:42:10,030
Trancers don't reflect.

548
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,652
You don't reflect.

549
00:42:11,652 --> 00:42:14,379
Jack Deth, calm yourself.

550
00:42:14,379 --> 00:42:16,296
There's no food here.

551
00:42:17,866 --> 00:42:18,866
God damn it.

552
00:42:22,669 --> 00:42:23,502
Ah.

553
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:33,434
Something's not right,
something's just not...

554
00:42:33,434 --> 00:42:35,160
(smacks)

555
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,469
Jack?

556
00:42:36,469 --> 00:42:38,633
He's all right.

557
00:42:38,633 --> 00:42:40,484
Do not worry.

558
00:42:40,484 --> 00:42:41,484
Never again.

559
00:42:50,674 --> 00:42:51,591
Prospero.

560
00:42:52,761 --> 00:42:55,094
(screaming)

561
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:58,945
Party's over.

562
00:42:58,945 --> 00:43:01,112
(yelling)

563
00:43:09,997 --> 00:43:12,497
(eerie music)

564
00:43:17,734 --> 00:43:20,651
I think I got this all figured out.

565
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,703
First they kill you with kindness,

566
00:43:24,703 --> 00:43:28,786
second they put you in an
eternal state of bliss.

567
00:43:30,055 --> 00:43:32,684
And then your body shrivels away.

568
00:43:32,684 --> 00:43:37,289
(laughs) And finally it dies.

569
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:40,057
And you're having too
God damn good of a time

570
00:43:40,057 --> 00:43:41,640
to even realize it!

571
00:43:42,966 --> 00:43:46,133
(howling and moaning)

572
00:43:51,136 --> 00:43:52,303
What the fuck?

573
00:44:10,275 --> 00:44:12,025
All right, listen up.

574
00:44:12,911 --> 00:44:15,785
Jack Deth, Angel City PD.

575
00:44:15,785 --> 00:44:16,702
Here, 2353.

576
00:44:20,678 --> 00:44:23,575
I've had about enough
of this psycho drama.

577
00:44:23,575 --> 00:44:24,992
I want all you...

578
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:31,355
Whatever the hell you
are, to suck floor now!

579
00:44:31,355 --> 00:44:32,188
Now!

580
00:44:33,798 --> 00:44:35,693
Hit the deck!

581
00:44:35,693 --> 00:44:36,526
Move!

582
00:44:44,344 --> 00:44:45,994
Can you not hear me?

583
00:44:45,994 --> 00:44:46,827
I...

584
00:44:56,067 --> 00:44:57,317
Son of a bitch.

585
00:45:03,726 --> 00:45:04,559
Come on.

586
00:45:07,151 --> 00:45:10,068
(foreboding music)

587
00:45:39,502 --> 00:45:40,419
Dear God.

588
00:45:41,403 --> 00:45:42,999
I told you.

589
00:45:42,999 --> 00:45:45,999
For a moment I thought she was Farr.

590
00:45:48,153 --> 00:45:48,986
Lyra?

591
00:45:53,721 --> 00:45:54,554
Yes?

592
00:45:55,676 --> 00:45:57,843
When did all this start?

593
00:45:58,722 --> 00:46:01,602
The strangest man visited me.

594
00:46:01,602 --> 00:46:03,269
Then he disappeared.

595
00:46:04,396 --> 00:46:05,229
Farr.

596
00:46:06,307 --> 00:46:07,557
Farr is dead.

597
00:46:12,945 --> 00:46:14,607
Farr was wise.

598
00:46:14,607 --> 00:46:17,423
He had the sight, but he's dead.

599
00:46:17,423 --> 00:46:19,310
I saw him die.

600
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:23,712
I don't believe he could've
just appeared here.

601
00:46:23,712 --> 00:46:25,462
Oh, that's too bad.

602
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,364
Why would he come to you?

603
00:46:31,364 --> 00:46:34,781
I was an empty vessel, now I am filled.

604
00:46:35,653 --> 00:46:39,162
Filled with the knowledge
I have always had.

605
00:46:39,162 --> 00:46:42,608
Things are going to
happen in their own time.

606
00:46:42,608 --> 00:46:45,191
Neither you, nor I can stop it.

607
00:46:46,696 --> 00:46:49,613
(foreboding music)

608
00:46:54,168 --> 00:46:56,335
That's Caliban's castle.

609
00:47:02,388 --> 00:47:06,497
I'll wager that is the
castle of unrelenting terror.

610
00:47:06,497 --> 00:47:07,914
But what is this?

611
00:47:14,886 --> 00:47:15,719
Beyond.

612
00:47:17,924 --> 00:47:20,424
(eerie music)

613
00:47:38,008 --> 00:47:39,425
So here we are.

614
00:47:49,991 --> 00:47:54,017
All right, now where the
hell's this timeand thing?

615
00:47:54,017 --> 00:47:55,100
It is here.

616
00:47:56,011 --> 00:48:00,178
(horn buzzing)
(yelling)

617
00:48:17,814 --> 00:48:19,083
Wake up, kid.

618
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:20,214
Kid!

619
00:48:20,214 --> 00:48:21,047
Wake up.

620
00:48:22,131 --> 00:48:24,881
Let Prospero get some shut-eye.

621
00:48:33,756 --> 00:48:37,839
I'll take care of him
after I take out the trash.

622
00:48:44,948 --> 00:48:47,531
(weapon fires)

623
00:48:50,279 --> 00:48:51,786
Not this time.

624
00:48:51,786 --> 00:48:53,734
My will is as strong as yours.

625
00:48:53,734 --> 00:48:54,935
Bull shit.

626
00:48:54,935 --> 00:48:56,539
Only squids get tranced.

627
00:48:56,539 --> 00:48:58,203
(weapon falls)

628
00:48:58,203 --> 00:49:00,286
(smacks)

629
00:49:03,129 --> 00:49:04,712
You're old, Jack.

630
00:49:05,705 --> 00:49:06,872
Old and tired.

631
00:49:07,745 --> 00:49:11,078
You can't take it anymore, can you Jack?

632
00:49:18,117 --> 00:49:20,200
(smacks)

633
00:49:27,999 --> 00:49:31,643
Your need to keep killing
and killing Trancers,

634
00:49:31,643 --> 00:49:34,691
it's destroyed everything
else in your life.

635
00:49:34,691 --> 00:49:36,024
Hasn't it, Jack?

636
00:49:43,416 --> 00:49:44,333
Fuck you.

637
00:49:45,627 --> 00:49:48,887
Trancers have destroyed
everything I treasure.

638
00:49:48,887 --> 00:49:49,720
Not me.

639
00:49:54,132 --> 00:49:56,215
(smacks)

640
00:50:08,017 --> 00:50:08,850
Treasure.

641
00:50:11,031 --> 00:50:15,198
To find what you treasure,
reach deep in your heart.

642
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:17,651
Lyra.

643
00:50:17,651 --> 00:50:19,881
It's all over, Jack.

644
00:50:19,881 --> 00:50:20,714
All over.

645
00:50:25,257 --> 00:50:27,257
I don't think so, pal.

646
00:50:28,188 --> 00:50:30,271
(smacks)

647
00:50:49,235 --> 00:50:51,441
Are we dead yet?

648
00:50:51,441 --> 00:50:53,395
Not even close.

649
00:50:53,395 --> 00:50:54,738
The timeand.

650
00:50:54,738 --> 00:50:55,889
You did it.

651
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:59,316
I bet you didn't think
I could pull it off, huh?

652
00:50:59,316 --> 00:51:00,899
Not for a moment.

653
00:51:02,201 --> 00:51:03,784
Let's get you home.

654
00:51:16,254 --> 00:51:17,087
Jesus.

655
00:51:18,852 --> 00:51:19,685
What?

656
00:51:19,685 --> 00:51:22,320
Simply a mother and child.

657
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:26,487
There's a lot of things in
this world I don't know about.

658
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,132
And I don't want to know.

659
00:51:30,132 --> 00:51:31,590
What the hell do I do with this?

660
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:34,237
It is governed by willpower.

661
00:51:34,237 --> 00:51:38,701
You decide where you want to
go, and it will take you there.

662
00:51:38,701 --> 00:51:40,701
(sighs)

663
00:51:44,862 --> 00:51:47,761
You got to clear your mind, Jack.

664
00:51:47,761 --> 00:51:50,019
If you enter the vortex with
your concentration scattered,

665
00:51:50,019 --> 00:51:51,936
it could rip you apart.

666
00:51:56,378 --> 00:51:59,045
(ambient noise)

667
00:52:01,036 --> 00:52:02,647
Where did he come from?

668
00:52:02,647 --> 00:52:05,506
It's not where I came from,

669
00:52:05,506 --> 00:52:07,506
but where you are going.

670
00:52:09,596 --> 00:52:13,263
But don't worry, you'll
be leaving together.

671
00:52:15,373 --> 00:52:16,956
Leaving this world.

672
00:52:18,607 --> 00:52:20,690
(laughs)

673
00:52:24,112 --> 00:52:25,494
Leaving this life.

674
00:52:25,494 --> 00:52:27,577
(smacks)

675
00:52:39,441 --> 00:52:43,092
You have made a tragic mistake, father.

676
00:52:43,092 --> 00:52:44,259
Yes, I know.

677
00:52:47,595 --> 00:52:50,845
I made you, but mistakes can be erased.

678
00:52:52,514 --> 00:52:54,651
(wields sword)

679
00:52:54,651 --> 00:52:58,818
(swords clanking)
(suspenseful music)

680
00:53:06,805 --> 00:53:08,473
You won't win.

681
00:53:08,473 --> 00:53:10,234
I already have.

682
00:53:10,234 --> 00:53:12,317
(smacks)

683
00:53:39,909 --> 00:53:41,497
My old friends,

684
00:53:41,497 --> 00:53:44,029
the time has finally come!

685
00:53:44,029 --> 00:53:46,030
I hold the timeand!

686
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:48,530
I am master of time and space!

687
00:53:49,443 --> 00:53:51,687
I could be your vessel.

688
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:55,854
Recreate yourselves in me,
and we will rule as one!

689
00:53:58,010 --> 00:54:01,467
[Voiceover] We have been
imprisoned far too long!

690
00:54:01,467 --> 00:54:03,566
Now we will be free!

691
00:54:03,566 --> 00:54:06,316
(dramatic music)

692
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:13,205
(lighting striking)

693
00:54:23,317 --> 00:54:24,567
At last, yes!

694
00:54:26,524 --> 00:54:29,214
Now I must return to my place of power.

695
00:54:29,214 --> 00:54:31,381
The great castle, my home!

696
00:54:35,583 --> 00:54:38,233
There we will walk free, as one.

697
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,316
Nothing will stop us now.

698
00:54:43,104 --> 00:54:45,937
(thunder crashes)

699
00:54:50,653 --> 00:54:51,558
Shaleen.

700
00:54:51,558 --> 00:54:52,391
Shaleen!

701
00:54:54,388 --> 00:54:55,600
Shaleen.

702
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,600
The heavens.

703
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:08,884
[Shaleen] I've never
seen them that way before.

704
00:55:08,884 --> 00:55:10,847
We're only one world.

705
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:13,180
We can only cast one shadow.

706
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:16,378
Awake the others.

707
00:55:16,378 --> 00:55:18,711
No telling how long we have.

708
00:55:19,844 --> 00:55:22,761
(foreboding music)

709
00:55:30,011 --> 00:55:31,649
Castle's ours.

710
00:55:31,649 --> 00:55:34,649
There'll be no Jack Deth to stop us.

711
00:55:56,886 --> 00:56:00,680
How kind of Caliban
to leave us here to die.

712
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,597
Die, huh?

713
00:56:04,369 --> 00:56:05,369
Don't worry.

714
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:08,710
Everything's under control.

715
00:56:09,982 --> 00:56:11,264
Go!

716
00:56:11,264 --> 00:56:13,242
I want someone at every tower!

717
00:56:13,242 --> 00:56:15,365
You're our first line of defense.

718
00:56:15,365 --> 00:56:17,365
Tessa, to your position.

719
00:56:32,679 --> 00:56:33,846
Hurry, Jack.

720
00:56:35,055 --> 00:56:36,690
I've gotta get in another line of work.

721
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:38,739
I should've been a doctor.

722
00:56:38,739 --> 00:56:39,906
Doctor Deth.

723
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:44,896
Caliban will head straight for the castle.

724
00:56:44,896 --> 00:56:47,124
Settle the score with the Tunnel Rats.

725
00:56:47,124 --> 00:56:47,957
Let's go.

726
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:52,150
(suspenseful music)

727
00:57:25,565 --> 00:57:26,913
Is the front gate secure?

728
00:57:26,913 --> 00:57:27,746
Solid.

729
00:57:27,746 --> 00:57:28,993
I bet my life on it.

730
00:57:28,993 --> 00:57:32,623
I hope it doesn't
come to that, my friend.

731
00:57:32,623 --> 00:57:33,456
Daniel!

732
00:57:33,456 --> 00:57:34,289
Get to the weapons room!

733
00:57:34,289 --> 00:57:36,622
(explosion)

734
00:57:37,522 --> 00:57:39,150
[Voiceover] Shaleen!

735
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:40,438
Ugh!

736
00:57:40,438 --> 00:57:42,048
Ugh.

737
00:57:42,048 --> 00:57:43,631
Fall back, damn it!

738
00:57:44,516 --> 00:57:45,877
Into the castle!

739
00:57:45,877 --> 00:57:48,128
Protect the others!

740
00:57:48,128 --> 00:57:50,560
Forget about me, Harson!

741
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,919
Go!

742
00:57:51,919 --> 00:57:53,370
Fall back!

743
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:55,417
I don't need you anymore!

744
00:57:55,417 --> 00:57:57,026
Go, damn it!

745
00:57:57,026 --> 00:57:57,859
Fall back!

746
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:09,142
Well, what do we have here?

747
00:58:09,142 --> 00:58:11,392
So you came to surrender?

748
00:58:12,686 --> 00:58:14,228
Once I may have found you amusing,

749
00:58:14,228 --> 00:58:16,645
but now you're simply boring.

750
00:58:18,345 --> 00:58:22,658
Lucius I believe you have
a debt owed to this one.

751
00:58:22,658 --> 00:58:23,908
Treat yourself.

752
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,502
You are most gracious.

753
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:35,076
How nice to see you again.

754
00:58:39,704 --> 00:58:41,287
An eye, for an eye.

755
00:58:42,833 --> 00:58:47,000
(dramatic music)
(grunting and hitting)

756
00:59:15,363 --> 00:59:16,946
Now, where were we?

757
00:59:23,015 --> 00:59:26,265
(hitting and grunting)

758
00:59:31,041 --> 00:59:32,708
An eye for an eye.

759
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,363
(grunts)

760
00:59:43,434 --> 00:59:46,184
(horse whinnies)

761
00:59:54,366 --> 00:59:57,116
You will be all right, Shaleen.

762
01:00:01,855 --> 01:00:03,605
No, you are too weak.

763
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,780
I do not love you.

764
01:00:19,919 --> 01:00:22,393
I do not love you.

765
01:00:22,393 --> 01:00:24,122
Hey, this is real sweet,

766
01:00:24,122 --> 01:00:26,372
but we gotta get a move on.

767
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:33,325
(yelling)
(suspenseful music)

768
01:00:48,651 --> 01:00:50,185
[Deth] Damn, he bolted the door.

769
01:00:50,185 --> 01:00:52,146
I know of another way.

770
01:00:52,146 --> 01:00:55,146
(suspenseful music)

771
01:01:20,355 --> 01:01:23,605
(fighting and yelling)

772
01:01:41,173 --> 01:01:42,464
Lyra.

773
01:01:42,464 --> 01:01:44,624
It's been so long.

774
01:01:44,624 --> 01:01:47,041
But for you, not long enough.

775
01:01:49,518 --> 01:01:50,351
Hold it.

776
01:01:53,772 --> 01:01:55,319
Again?

777
01:01:55,319 --> 01:01:57,773
Again and again, until you go down.

778
01:01:57,773 --> 01:01:58,606
No!

779
01:02:01,881 --> 01:02:02,714
He's mine.

780
01:02:05,008 --> 01:02:07,175
(yelling)

781
01:02:09,077 --> 01:02:11,077
Nothing of yours, boy.

782
01:02:12,093 --> 01:02:13,176
Not a father.

783
01:02:15,133 --> 01:02:15,966
Nothing.

784
01:02:17,107 --> 01:02:18,718
Let him go.

785
01:02:18,718 --> 01:02:21,498
I could crush him Wolf's
Head, with a thought,

786
01:02:21,498 --> 01:02:23,718
or you can pull that trigger.

787
01:02:23,718 --> 01:02:26,655
I could crush you just as easily.

788
01:02:26,655 --> 01:02:29,793
Unlike this unworthy bastard,

789
01:02:29,793 --> 01:02:33,885
you have proven yourself
to be a worthy adversary.

790
01:02:33,885 --> 01:02:35,885
(moans)

791
01:02:41,371 --> 01:02:42,204
Jack Deth.

792
01:02:44,741 --> 01:02:48,908
You would like to fight me,
man to man, wouldn't you?

793
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,353
You bet.

794
01:02:56,307 --> 01:02:58,557
Perhaps, in another life.

795
01:03:00,269 --> 01:03:02,203
(arrow fires)

796
01:03:02,203 --> 01:03:04,370
(gasping)

797
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:07,083
Jack!

798
01:03:11,707 --> 01:03:13,790
(grunts)

799
01:03:27,017 --> 01:03:29,517
(stone falls)

800
01:03:32,438 --> 01:03:34,688
(grunting)

801
01:03:51,338 --> 01:03:52,171
At last.

802
01:03:53,523 --> 01:03:56,023
(sword stabs)

803
01:03:59,381 --> 01:04:00,214
My son.

804
01:04:01,589 --> 01:04:02,422
No more.

805
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:06,110
(dramatic music)

806
01:04:11,299 --> 01:04:12,216
Prospero.

807
01:04:14,228 --> 01:04:16,143
Back to LA, you son of a bitch.

808
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:18,726
(weapon fires)

809
01:04:35,287 --> 01:04:36,954
They're both gone.

810
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:40,416
Not completely gone.

811
01:04:40,416 --> 01:04:43,333
Jack has left me something special.

812
01:04:49,656 --> 01:04:52,406
(engine roaring)

813
01:04:55,817 --> 01:04:56,945
What the hell is going on in here?

814
01:04:56,945 --> 01:04:58,520
There's something, all right.

815
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:01,084
It must have regenerated
itself in the TCL chamber,

816
01:05:01,084 --> 01:05:02,876
and Jack's trapped in there with it.

817
01:05:02,876 --> 01:05:03,901
Oh my God.

818
01:05:03,901 --> 01:05:04,734
I can't override this.

819
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,367
I can. Hurry.

820
01:05:06,367 --> 01:05:08,534
(beeping)

821
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,284
It's gone!

822
01:05:17,284 --> 01:05:18,117
He's gone!

823
01:05:20,026 --> 01:05:21,026
Where is he?

824
01:05:23,768 --> 01:05:25,705
We've lost telemetry.

825
01:05:25,705 --> 01:05:27,455
He could be anywhere.

826
01:05:28,867 --> 01:05:31,683
There's gotta be a trace of him.

827
01:05:31,683 --> 01:05:34,524
You just don't lose a whole chamber trace.

828
01:05:34,524 --> 01:05:35,857
It's impossible.

829
01:05:38,173 --> 01:05:39,986
You can if it's destroyed.

830
01:05:39,986 --> 01:05:42,569
(somber music)

831
01:05:59,646 --> 01:06:01,063
Son of a bitch.

832
01:06:03,802 --> 01:06:06,606
[Harris] I thought he was invincible.

833
01:06:06,606 --> 01:06:08,273
Too stubborn to die.

834
01:06:09,224 --> 01:06:13,291
You know, I only loom for
him for such a short time,

835
01:06:13,291 --> 01:06:17,458
but there's something about
him, and I just fell in love.

836
01:06:19,625 --> 01:06:23,208
I should've, I could've
given him a chance.

837
01:06:24,432 --> 01:06:27,265
I remember one time Alice and I,

838
01:06:28,392 --> 01:06:30,392
she was his former wife.

839
01:06:31,859 --> 01:06:34,270
Well we kinda got drunk together,

840
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:36,770
and she spoke hours about him.

841
01:06:37,671 --> 01:06:40,338
She told me how tough, stubborn,

842
01:06:41,678 --> 01:06:44,042
how single-minded he was.

843
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:44,875
Yeah.

844
01:06:46,424 --> 01:06:50,296
But that the sex was
incredible. (Laughs)

845
01:06:50,296 --> 01:06:51,689
Yeah?

846
01:06:51,689 --> 01:06:55,856
Well, now I'm really sorry
I didn't give him a chance.

847
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:00,375
Well it just makes you realize

848
01:07:00,375 --> 01:07:03,814
how much you have to value each other.

849
01:07:03,814 --> 01:07:07,481
Never take each other
for granted because...

850
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:17,449
You just never know.

851
01:07:19,673 --> 01:07:20,757
Excuse me.

852
01:07:20,757 --> 01:07:22,242
I think I need to be alone.

853
01:07:22,242 --> 01:07:23,575
[Harris] Yeah.

854
01:07:25,929 --> 01:07:29,744
Need some company while you're alone?

855
01:07:29,744 --> 01:07:30,997
Jack?

856
01:07:30,997 --> 01:07:32,737
How did you get out?

857
01:07:32,737 --> 01:07:34,125
It's a long story.

858
01:07:34,125 --> 01:07:35,375
A long story?

859
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:37,925
I'll tell you all about it,

860
01:07:37,925 --> 01:07:42,092
as soon as I get this kid
back home where he belongs.

861
01:07:44,851 --> 01:07:46,351
And who are you?

862
01:07:47,324 --> 01:07:52,090
I am someone who would
like to stay for awhile.

863
01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:54,302
Jack, I feel different.

864
01:07:54,302 --> 01:07:56,389
The hunger is gone.

865
01:07:56,389 --> 01:08:00,058
Passing through the dimensions
must have changed me.

866
01:08:00,058 --> 01:08:01,808
What about Shaleen?

867
01:08:03,803 --> 01:08:07,386
Even together we
could never be together.

868
01:08:09,082 --> 01:08:10,749
Jack, about Alice.

869
01:08:12,784 --> 01:08:14,284
I really love her.

870
01:08:15,991 --> 01:08:17,824
That's good, Harris.

871
01:08:23,482 --> 01:08:26,399
Look Lyra, we got a lot to discuss.

872
01:08:27,488 --> 01:08:29,738
Think we could start clean?

873
01:08:30,681 --> 01:08:31,514
Hello.

874
01:08:32,414 --> 01:08:34,414
I'm Doctor Lyra Sirrell.

875
01:08:35,691 --> 01:08:37,358
Hi, I'm Jack Deth.

876
01:08:42,991 --> 01:08:44,611
Jack Deth, huh?

877
01:08:44,611 --> 01:08:47,361
(peaceful music)

878
01:08:59,692 --> 01:09:03,359
(moves into dramatic music)
