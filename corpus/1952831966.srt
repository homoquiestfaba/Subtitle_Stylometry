1
00:06:02,357 --> 00:06:05,486
What I do requires a certain mindset.

2
00:06:07,712 --> 00:06:09,292
I do assignments.

3
00:06:10,465 --> 00:06:12,526
Designated targets.

4
00:06:13,785 --> 00:06:16,991
Some jobs need to look like accidents,

5
00:06:18,817 --> 00:06:22,678
Others must cast the suspicion
on someone else.

6
00:06:26,972 --> 00:06:30,740
A select few, you need to send
a clear message.

7
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,080
Pulling a trigger is easy.

8
00:06:38,305 --> 00:06:42,515
The best jobs are the ones that nobody
even knows you were there.

9
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,335
A liquor fairy paid me a visit last night.

10
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:18,892
Left me a big ole bottle of Scotch.
He even sprung for the good stuff.

11
00:07:21,914 --> 00:07:24,225
See you, Henry.

12
00:07:50,548 --> 00:07:54,650
Why the fuck do I let you drag
me out to this shit hole?

13
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:59,929
You're a snob, Harry. Eleven hundred people
come through here everyday.

14
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,271
Hard to remember two
fellows who pass it thru'.

15
00:08:02,272 --> 00:08:04,402
Thank you.

16
00:08:05,216 --> 00:08:07,677
Of course, people might remember them.

17
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:12,611
I know that kinda defeats your purpose.

18
00:08:12,648 --> 00:08:15,409
I was an ex-zonal where you work
without a network.

19
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,878
Try to get them suits that fit,
they look like costumes!

20
00:08:20,026 --> 00:08:22,210
Everything went okay?

21
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,340
It got done.

22
00:08:26,896 --> 00:08:29,516
You know I'm better than you, you know?

23
00:08:29,734 --> 00:08:32,871
That's why they give you those jobs
that can get a little hairy because..

24
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,722
If it were to get hairy then
you would take care of it

25
00:08:35,801 --> 00:08:39,659
and that's all they care about.
Service is rendered, no loose ends.

26
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:44,322
Fait accompli.
You're a goddamn machine.

27
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:48,654
You see things,
you view people...

28
00:08:48,776 --> 00:08:51,650
Differently than I do,
differently than anybody does.

29
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:54,526
But you got a problem, Arthur.

30
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,516
- You need companionship.
- I have you, Harry.

31
00:08:57,638 --> 00:09:00,940
Oh, then you're in deeper
shit than I thought.

32
00:09:02,347 --> 00:09:03,726
So, how's Steven?

33
00:09:03,921 --> 00:09:06,825
Did I tell you that I got him
a job in a private security firm?

34
00:09:07,551 --> 00:09:11,171
They kicked him out last month.
Beat some guy half to death.

35
00:09:14,923 --> 00:09:19,792
Goddamn disappointment. Always
has and always will be.

36
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,859
- Call him.
- Me, call him?

37
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,132
- For what?
- Yeah, he probably needs to hear from you.

38
00:09:30,598 --> 00:09:31,862
Yeah.

39
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:34,395
Let's go. We'll get your money.

40
00:10:21,828 --> 00:10:24,264
Come on, dance with me?

41
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:27,038
Please.

42
00:11:05,894 --> 00:11:07,761
You hungry?

43
00:11:09,124 --> 00:11:11,076
Sure.

44
00:11:26,098 --> 00:11:27,968
I gotta go.

45
00:11:29,016 --> 00:11:30,615
Okay.

46
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,326
Never going to tell me your name?

47
00:11:52,236 --> 00:11:53,975
Arthur.

48
00:11:55,337 --> 00:11:58,442
Nice try. You're no Arthur.

49
00:11:58,897 --> 00:12:02,854
No, more like a David.

50
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:05,254
Or Brad.

51
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:09,607
Yeah. See you, Brad.

52
00:12:54,084 --> 00:12:57,132
- Global Engineering.
- I'm calling about the ad.

53
00:12:57,683 --> 00:13:00,727
- There must be a mistake.
- One moment, please.

54
00:13:02,947 --> 00:13:06,273
The advertisement was proved.
The information was accurate.

55
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:09,667
Call a meeting.

56
00:13:10,107 --> 00:13:12,444
We'll get back to you.

57
00:13:18,874 --> 00:13:21,316
Mr. Bishop, Mr. Dean has
agreed to a meeting.

58
00:13:21,437 --> 00:13:23,455
A private jet will pick
you up in one hour and

59
00:13:23,456 --> 00:13:25,475
deliver you to a neutral
site of his choosing.

60
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:29,683
You'll be allowed fifteen minutes.
The jet will then return you.

61
00:13:30,081 --> 00:13:34,195
When we tell you to be home at 10 o'clock,
we mean 10 not 11:30.

62
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:36,200
I don't care, baby. You
scared your mother to death.

63
00:13:36,201 --> 00:13:37,992
You're grounded for two weeks.

64
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,071
Just one second.

65
00:13:42,595 --> 00:13:44,724
That's not my problem.

66
00:13:45,898 --> 00:13:49,671
Allright look. Ten days and you volunteer
two Saturdays at the shelter.

67
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:52,688
Eight days and three Saturdays.

68
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:55,252
- Nice ring.
- Done.

69
00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:57,820
- I don't get one of those.
- I don't think you can.

70
00:13:58,326 --> 00:13:59,891
Unless you're a world champion.

71
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:01,457
Just tell him to come
out and fix it, honey.

72
00:14:02,263 --> 00:14:04,077
Well, let's go.

73
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:11,413
I've just been out-negotiated
by a sixteen year old.

74
00:14:12,287 --> 00:14:13,703
Let's take a walk.

75
00:14:18,185 --> 00:14:20,736
Six months ago we were
commissioned to undertake

76
00:14:20,737 --> 00:14:23,288
the largest contract
we've ever attempted.

77
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:27,109
The target was far more high profile than
we're normally comfortable with.

78
00:14:27,565 --> 00:14:31,297
- The job was just too rich to pass up.
- The target was South African?

79
00:14:31,418 --> 00:14:35,200
The target fled to South Africa.
That's where we made our move in Capetown.

80
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:37,509
It took six months to set up,

81
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:41,511
I assigned a team of five operatives
to work in concert on the mission.

82
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:46,244
All five were killed.
Someone knew everything.

83
00:14:46,342 --> 00:14:49,082
You probably knew some
of the men on our team.

84
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,822
I knew this one, Sebastian.

85
00:14:53,147 --> 00:14:55,713
You know how this company works, Mr. Bishop.

86
00:14:56,178 --> 00:14:59,513
Only two partners know
the details of any given job.

87
00:15:00,772 --> 00:15:05,545
Two people knew the details here.
Me and Harry McKenna.

88
00:15:06,526 --> 00:15:08,385
Harry sold us out.

89
00:15:11,761 --> 00:15:16,512
We pulled his financials. Take a look
at recent offshore deposits.

90
00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:20,619
There's one there made two weeks ago
for twenty million US dollars.

91
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:24,130
He's gotten old,
he's gotten weak.

92
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:28,621
He's loaded with debts, his divorce,
his caust and troubled son.

93
00:15:28,742 --> 00:15:30,616
That made him vulnerable.

94
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,338
And for the past 13
years, I have been fiercely

95
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:35,968
loyal to him. There's
no one I respected more.

96
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:40,935
But Harry McKenna has poisoned the well.
He needs to be removed...

97
00:15:41,184 --> 00:15:44,178
- Immediately.
- Let me talk to him.

98
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:47,224
Look, I appreciate your
connection with Harry.

99
00:15:47,225 --> 00:15:49,748
But there's no turning back here.

100
00:15:50,771 --> 00:15:53,488
He has "Crossed his Rubicon".

101
00:15:53,523 --> 00:15:57,375
Everyday he's alive,
puts this company in danger.

102
00:15:58,554 --> 00:16:01,684
You know we would all prefer
that you handle this.

103
00:16:01,806 --> 00:16:03,941
Given your relationship, you're in best

104
00:16:03,942 --> 00:16:06,076
position to get this done
quickly and discretly.

105
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:10,204
And to be honest with you, I hate the idea
of Harry suffering unnecessarily.

106
00:16:11,366 --> 00:16:15,417
We don't wanna go to my outside source.
But we will if we have to.

107
00:16:17,585 --> 00:16:19,161
Excuse me a sec.

108
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:25,051
Jess, negotiations are closed, I'm sorry.

109
00:16:25,697 --> 00:16:29,136
I'm in a meeting.
Okay, hang on, son.

110
00:16:30,905 --> 00:16:34,614
Forty eight hours or we'll
proceed without you.

111
00:16:36,967 --> 00:16:41,869
Hey, squared, remember the expression
"Quit while you're ahead"?

112
00:16:45,492 --> 00:16:50,609
Yeah. I mean, Roosevelt to
be truthful is my hero.

113
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:56,213
I mean, the way he dealt
with this damn chair.

114
00:16:56,334 --> 00:16:57,557
Goldwin, pull your trousers
up, will you, please?

115
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,781
Pull you trousers up?

116
00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:02,087
You know, those suits doesn't really
fit you guys very well.

117
00:17:58,516 --> 00:18:01,888
- Yeah?
- Get out of the building, Harry.

118
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:05,267
- Arthur?
- They're coming for you tonight.

119
00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:08,399
- Who, who's coming?
- Dean.

120
00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:11,273
Take whatever you can use
against them and get out.

121
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,921
Oh, Jesus!

122
00:18:13,207 --> 00:18:16,136
- Do you have a pair of scissors?
- Yeah.

123
00:18:19,788 --> 00:18:22,636
- Go to the elevator lobby.
- On my way.

124
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:32,430
Looks like we got a power
outage on the 18th floor.

125
00:18:32,469 --> 00:18:34,696
You have 15 seconds to
get to the service elevator

126
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,924
before the emergency power comes on.

127
00:18:37,045 --> 00:18:39,215
- There's a keypad.
- Punch in the building number.

128
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:41,303
I thought we cut the power off?

129
00:18:41,304 --> 00:18:43,347
Service elevators have to
work on a separate power source.

130
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:45,960
I'm in.

131
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:48,741
Press the basement floor.

132
00:18:48,742 --> 00:18:51,007
The elevator will take
18 seconds to get there.

133
00:18:51,358 --> 00:18:55,097
The level is empty and unused.
Take the ramp.

134
00:18:55,330 --> 00:19:00,114
It connects to the building next door.
Leads to an underground parking lot.

135
00:19:01,382 --> 00:19:02,763
Shit!

136
00:19:04,432 --> 00:19:08,851
Security cameras haven't been fitted
in this building yet, so they'll be blind.

137
00:19:15,472 --> 00:19:18,644
Okay, you should be
entering the parking lot.

138
00:19:30,157 --> 00:19:33,988
- My van's here.
- I left it there.

139
00:19:34,743 --> 00:19:37,088
Oh, shit.

140
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:48,780
I hate it. You get me to
circumvent my own security, eh?

141
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,802
Nobody sees me leave.

142
00:19:55,346 --> 00:19:58,841
So what's this?
Cape Town, right?

143
00:19:59,985 --> 00:20:02,273
Yeah. Right.

144
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:07,820
So what's the story here?

145
00:20:07,926 --> 00:20:09,569
Car jacking?

146
00:20:09,823 --> 00:20:14,367
Police will find my van somewhere
in some shit hole section of the city,

147
00:20:14,622 --> 00:20:17,459
Stripped, up on blocks.

148
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:19,288
Something like that.

149
00:20:22,163 --> 00:20:25,443
Oh, a slight editorial revision!

150
00:20:25,944 --> 00:20:27,533
You don't mind, do you?

151
00:20:31,043 --> 00:20:34,527
AMAT VICTORIA CURAM.

152
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:48,543
Yeah, I get off a couple of shots,
there's a struggle,

153
00:20:48,644 --> 00:20:52,692
They get my gun.
C'est la vie!

154
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:56,044
At least I don't go down
looking like a pussy.

155
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,198
I've had that for 33 years.

156
00:21:02,824 --> 00:21:06,588
A gift from Admiral Beasly, sixth fleet.

157
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:11,193
That's the first time
I ever fired it.

158
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,726
- Why didn't you kill me?
- No.

159
00:21:18,173 --> 00:21:20,432
They'll just send somebody else.

160
00:21:22,494 --> 00:21:25,576
I would rather it was you, Arthur.

161
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:29,434
I have to live with it.

162
00:22:32,766 --> 00:22:36,445
- Arthur fucking Bishop.
- Sorry for your loss.

163
00:22:37,311 --> 00:22:40,042
More of a loss for you
than me, buddy.

164
00:22:40,686 --> 00:22:42,639
It's a long time.

165
00:23:06,857 --> 00:23:10,102
Hey, would you give me a ride to
my father's house?

166
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,282
Your father, talked about you a lot.

167
00:23:21,683 --> 00:23:24,644
- Talked about spending time with you?
- Maybe make it up.

168
00:23:24,825 --> 00:23:26,700
Give it a rest, will you?

169
00:23:27,047 --> 00:23:29,336
You know, he always bringing you up.

170
00:23:29,847 --> 00:23:31,478
He had regrets, Steven.

171
00:23:31,515 --> 00:23:33,587
Yeah? He could have
picked up the phone anytime.

172
00:23:49,465 --> 00:23:51,293
I want to show you something.

173
00:24:01,032 --> 00:24:04,196
I loved this place as a kid.

174
00:24:10,995 --> 00:24:12,940
It's pretty impressive, huh?

175
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:18,805
Everyone of them,
served their country.

176
00:24:19,886 --> 00:24:22,515
I guess I could still enlist!

177
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:24,886
You know, make him proud.

178
00:24:26,858 --> 00:24:28,477
I'm fucking with you!

179
00:24:29,018 --> 00:24:33,252
I don't know if you have a
picture of him, but I thought maybe you..

180
00:24:33,535 --> 00:24:35,376
Want one.

181
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:48,758
Looks like you're not planning
on sticking around?

182
00:24:48,879 --> 00:24:52,646
For what?
He didn't leave a will.

183
00:24:52,664 --> 00:24:55,934
The accounts are empty.
Banks going to take the house.

184
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,938
By the time of the lawyers,
city and state get through

185
00:24:58,939 --> 00:25:01,607
with the rest, there's not
gonna be a fucking thing left.

186
00:25:01,728 --> 00:25:05,350
- Where you headed?
- Folk's place.

187
00:25:08,361 --> 00:25:11,779
- Need some money?
- No, thanks.

188
00:25:13,332 --> 00:25:16,657
I got a guy coming to the house.
He's gonna look at the car.

189
00:25:16,778 --> 00:25:19,969
I figured that will probably get me
through on the next spot.

190
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:23,073
What about the guns?

191
00:25:26,194 --> 00:25:31,260
I was thinking about going out and killing
myself a couple of car jackers tonight.

192
00:25:33,356 --> 00:25:36,533
Just any old run of the mill car-jacker.

193
00:25:36,655 --> 00:25:40,534
Yeah, you never know, it might get
lucky, find the guys that kill my dad.

194
00:25:41,215 --> 00:25:43,288
Going to make you feel better?

195
00:25:45,014 --> 00:25:46,877
Fuck if I know.

196
00:25:47,873 --> 00:25:49,448
I will find out.

197
00:26:00,118 --> 00:26:02,439
Save it up, Steve.

198
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,719
Hey Bishop?

199
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:14,185
What kind of person shoots someone
in a wheelchair, anyway?

200
00:27:13,627 --> 00:27:15,587
Yo?

201
00:27:19,428 --> 00:27:21,831
- Hey.
- Hey, you need some help?

202
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:27,807
No, I think I got it.

203
00:27:29,207 --> 00:27:33,318
I was supposed to meet a friend and
I might of gotten the address wrong.

204
00:27:33,681 --> 00:27:35,677
Yeah, maybe.

205
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:39,787
Well maybe the address got me wrong.

206
00:27:41,778 --> 00:27:45,052
- Nice car, man. Nice car.
- Thanks.

207
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:49,906
- Can I have it?
- What?

208
00:27:50,027 --> 00:27:54,458
I'm releaving you of your automobile,
motherfucker! Out of the car?

209
00:27:55,331 --> 00:27:57,776
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

210
00:27:59,155 --> 00:28:02,576
Jesus, fuck okay. Okay.

211
00:28:09,214 --> 00:28:11,134
Carjacker?

212
00:28:14,387 --> 00:28:16,401
Did you shoot him with this?

213
00:28:17,552 --> 00:28:19,585
Is this the gun you used?

214
00:28:20,812 --> 00:28:21,989
No?

215
00:28:54,629 --> 00:28:56,312
Hey, bad move.

216
00:28:58,744 --> 00:29:00,941
Probably thought this through,
did you, Steven?

217
00:29:04,614 --> 00:29:08,033
This may not seem like it,
but tonight's your lucky night,

218
00:29:08,086 --> 00:29:10,037
Raymond.

219
00:29:12,276 --> 00:29:16,091
If anybody asks, you fell down.
Because we'll come looking for you.

220
00:29:16,418 --> 00:29:18,190
Get out of here!

221
00:29:21,283 --> 00:29:23,875
Stupid to kill someone
when you have a motive.

222
00:29:24,086 --> 00:29:26,336
Might as well paint a bulls eye
on your back.

223
00:29:26,795 --> 00:29:29,996
- I don't give a shit.
- Whatever.

224
00:29:32,724 --> 00:29:34,009
Get out of here!

225
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:45,492
Fuck!

226
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:31,120
I was thinking about what
were you saying the other night.

227
00:30:32,035 --> 00:30:33,838
And eh... I wanna know what you know.

228
00:30:34,659 --> 00:30:38,546
Go online.
It's all on the Internet.

229
00:30:39,397 --> 00:30:43,222
But I don't wanna read it,
I wanna do it.

230
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:47,829
- Do what exactly?
- Bishop, don't bullshit me!

231
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:51,131
I know about you.
And him.

232
00:30:51,662 --> 00:30:56,067
He was your mentor. He chose
you over me. You owe him.

233
00:30:56,894 --> 00:31:00,660
Now that he's gone, he left me with
fucking nothing. You owe me now.

234
00:31:01,765 --> 00:31:04,072
Go home, Steve.

235
00:31:29,998 --> 00:31:31,996
Still for sale.

236
00:31:32,541 --> 00:31:36,771
You know you want it.
No other lifetime for this.

237
00:31:38,201 --> 00:31:42,871
Want some advice?
Follow what this tells you.

238
00:31:43,716 --> 00:31:46,676
He's trying to tell you something.

239
00:31:46,744 --> 00:31:50,806
He's telling you, you're homesick for
a place you never been.

240
00:32:23,712 --> 00:32:27,163
8600 Elborano Street.
7 A.M tomorrow.

241
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:36,932
Serac animal shelter, can I help you?

242
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:46,297
- What is this place?
- It's an animal shelter.

243
00:32:46,361 --> 00:32:49,766
- Yeah, I know what it is. Why are we here?
- Look for a dog like this.

244
00:32:49,824 --> 00:32:53,595
- Under a year if possible.
- I'd taken you more for a cat person.

245
00:32:57,257 --> 00:33:01,032
You know what a Mechanic is,
outside its obvious definition?

246
00:33:01,219 --> 00:33:05,248
A guy who fixes things,
problems, does contracts.

247
00:33:05,888 --> 00:33:08,822
- A hitman.
- I do assignments.

248
00:33:09,311 --> 00:33:12,292
- Designated targets.
- I could do that.

249
00:33:12,744 --> 00:33:15,245
- I've seen some shit.
- No, you haven't.

250
00:33:16,991 --> 00:33:19,969
You know shit about me, Bishop.

251
00:33:20,274 --> 00:33:23,386
Steven Jackson McKenna.
Born in Baltimore, Maryland.

252
00:33:23,445 --> 00:33:26,783
Your mother died when you was 12.
Mixture of pain meds and vodka.

253
00:33:26,903 --> 00:33:30,424
You attended 3 different high schools,
Grant, The Park and Munroe.

254
00:33:30,545 --> 00:33:32,792
Elected in four sports.
Got a scholarship from Miami,

255
00:33:32,852 --> 00:33:36,634
that was rescinded upon a conviction of
possession with an attempt to distribute.

256
00:33:36,884 --> 00:33:39,053
Add four misdemeanors
for aggrevated assault and

257
00:33:39,054 --> 00:33:41,223
local threats against
two different girlfriends.

258
00:33:41,345 --> 00:33:43,371
Broke your kneecap in a streetfight.

259
00:33:43,372 --> 00:33:45,399
Didn't wanna tell anyone so
you let a tale on its own.

260
00:33:45,477 --> 00:33:49,057
Now when it rains, you walk with a limp.
I'll show you the X-rays if you like.

261
00:33:55,029 --> 00:33:58,266
A friend here would like
to adopt this little fella.

262
00:34:00,657 --> 00:34:02,814
Good boy.

263
00:34:12,591 --> 00:34:15,179
What I do requires a certain mindset.

264
00:34:15,822 --> 00:34:18,198
Revenge is an emotion
that can get you killed.

265
00:34:18,255 --> 00:34:21,289
So no more stupid stunts
like the other night.

266
00:34:26,997 --> 00:34:29,706
Walk it, feel it, make it your best friend.

267
00:34:29,827 --> 00:34:32,417
Tomorrow, eleven, Fisher Square.

268
00:34:47,432 --> 00:34:50,054
Take the dog to the coffee
shop on Riverdale.

269
00:34:50,497 --> 00:34:52,763
Order a coffee.
Black.

270
00:34:53,155 --> 00:34:56,513
Sit at the table by the window, and do the
sudoku puzzle in the paper.

271
00:34:56,635 --> 00:34:59,986
- Play it nice with the dog.
- For how long?

272
00:34:59,987 --> 00:35:01,029
One hour.

273
00:35:01,173 --> 00:35:03,821
Every day for the next three weeks.

274
00:35:27,115 --> 00:35:29,867
This is yours.

275
00:35:44,306 --> 00:35:47,210
Practice on this.

276
00:35:47,602 --> 00:35:50,723
Insurance companies know
everything about how people die.

277
00:35:50,759 --> 00:35:52,750
They even have books with actuaries.

278
00:35:52,871 --> 00:35:55,770
Lists of every cause of death imaginable.

279
00:35:56,116 --> 00:35:58,426
Whyn't you just shoot 'em and fuck all this?

280
00:35:58,547 --> 00:36:02,723
Good judgement comes from experience and
a lot of that comes from bad judgement.

281
00:36:20,156 --> 00:36:24,158
Bed's under the boxes.
Help yourself.

282
00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:53,423
How long you've been working on it?

283
00:36:55,854 --> 00:36:59,776
- Two years.
- It's nice.

284
00:37:00,649 --> 00:37:05,439
- When are we going to go for a ride?
- We? Never.

285
00:37:07,744 --> 00:37:10,437
Time to take your training
to the next level.

286
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:34,365
- Who's that?
- He's good.

287
00:37:34,831 --> 00:37:36,586
Only checked you out.

288
00:37:37,472 --> 00:37:41,068
I can come back.
Rather than stand out here.

289
00:37:51,122 --> 00:37:54,155
I gotta tell you man.
I'm a little skittish right now.

290
00:37:54,277 --> 00:37:57,125
Not sure if this a good time
for me to be doing anything.

291
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:00,767
It's a lot of shit wind, you know.

292
00:38:02,422 --> 00:38:04,232
I brought the list and the money.

293
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:08,036
Now's not a good time?

294
00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:11,797
Let me see the list.

295
00:38:16,617 --> 00:38:19,543
- All this by when?
- As soon as possible.

296
00:38:20,014 --> 00:38:23,840
All right. Take me a day
to make it happen.

297
00:38:24,853 --> 00:38:27,384
May I have the money?

298
00:39:06,538 --> 00:39:10,007
Auto-erotic asphyxiation?
- Yep.

299
00:39:14,013 --> 00:39:16,741
I just thought you should
see one up close.

300
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,464
Don't ever touch this.

301
00:40:01,847 --> 00:40:04,135
Follow me.

302
00:40:13,977 --> 00:40:18,390
- Who was he?
- A job. Nothing more, nothing less.

303
00:40:18,739 --> 00:40:21,601
Makes you feel better, he was
an illegal arms dealer.

304
00:40:22,371 --> 00:40:24,115
Sold weapons to anyone.

305
00:40:24,397 --> 00:40:27,655
Cop killers, gangbangers,
terrorists.

306
00:40:27,978 --> 00:40:29,894
He didn't discriminate.

307
00:40:40,774 --> 00:40:43,138
That's the file.

308
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:48,035
The guy from the coffee shop?

309
00:40:48,892 --> 00:40:51,007
All yours.

310
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:55,284
You wouldn't know it by looking at him.
But he's a Mechanic for another group.

311
00:40:56,349 --> 00:40:59,487
His only routine is coffee
every morning from nine to ten.

312
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:01,831
Doesn't go any place twice,
except here.

313
00:41:03,578 --> 00:41:05,682
He's insulated... protected.

314
00:41:05,906 --> 00:41:09,987
No way in without him seeing us coming.
Except he has two weaknesses.

315
00:41:10,022 --> 00:41:12,220
- Chihuahuas...
- Mind if I sit down?

316
00:41:12,325 --> 00:41:14,149
- Please.
- And boys.

317
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,347
- Young boys.
- Coffee, black.

318
00:41:17,468 --> 00:41:19,464
No doubt he's checked you
out over the past six weeks

319
00:41:19,465 --> 00:41:21,461
and found no connection
to you in this world.

320
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:24,479
All he sees is a good
looking kid who's kind of lost.

321
00:41:24,506 --> 00:41:26,959
- You want to hold him?
- Yeah.

322
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:29,657
- He likes that.
- Come here, baby.

323
00:41:29,756 --> 00:41:33,308
If he's interested, the
first thing he'll do is ask you.

324
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:34,848
Do you live around here, Steve?

325
00:41:34,911 --> 00:41:37,760
- Your answer should be.
- I'm on my own, bouncing around.

326
00:41:38,016 --> 00:41:40,307
Which means you're broke
and open to suggestions.

327
00:41:40,428 --> 00:41:42,654
- Who's my buddy.
- Yeah.

328
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:45,849
- Then ask if...
- You want to get a drink one evening?

329
00:41:45,894 --> 00:41:48,017
- Your answer should be.
- Yeah.

330
00:41:49,732 --> 00:41:52,214
Great. That's great ain't it?

331
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:56,124
- Flunitrazepam.
- Groovy.

332
00:41:57,018 --> 00:41:59,639
You want me to kill him,
not rape him, right?

333
00:42:03,284 --> 00:42:05,157
Two to three drops, he's woozy.

334
00:42:05,585 --> 00:42:09,994
Over six, his heart stops and he's brain
dead in under three minutes.

335
00:42:10,884 --> 00:42:13,578
Do it in the bar.
Make it clean.

336
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:23,052
All these fancy places they always
water down their boooze.

337
00:42:23,174 --> 00:42:26,027
So I think that's why these are
going down so fast.

338
00:42:27,668 --> 00:42:29,051
They don't water down
the wine, that's for sure.

339
00:42:29,052 --> 00:42:30,434
It's really good.

340
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,148
- Dig more?
- Yeah.

341
00:42:32,269 --> 00:42:34,763
- Jameson, right?
- Jamesons double, please.

342
00:42:44,545 --> 00:42:48,163
Don't mess the wine with this guy.
Do it in the bar, make it clean.

343
00:42:51,226 --> 00:42:54,674
I want to know what you know.
I want to do.

344
00:43:07,782 --> 00:43:09,847
What?
What's funny?

345
00:43:09,969 --> 00:43:12,217
No. Nothings funny. I'm
just.. I think I had too many.

346
00:43:12,219 --> 00:43:14,466
No, come on.

347
00:43:14,587 --> 00:43:18,673
No.. I think I'm going to finish this one.
I'm going to finish this and I'm done.

348
00:43:21,429 --> 00:43:25,322
I really should go to bed..
But this is very.. it's funny.

349
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:35,457
Steve!

350
00:43:38,217 --> 00:43:39,044
Hey.

351
00:43:39,103 --> 00:43:41,014
You all right?

352
00:43:41,078 --> 00:43:44,227
- Yeah, how are you?
- I'm good, man.

353
00:43:45,388 --> 00:43:49,195
Hey, can I give you a ride someplace?
Car is right here.

354
00:43:49,674 --> 00:43:52,796
Come on. Get in.
I want to show you something.

355
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,675
Yeah?

356
00:43:54,676 --> 00:43:56,302
He's six foot seven,
300 pounds and lethal.

357
00:43:56,996 --> 00:43:59,095
Do not take this guy on.

358
00:43:59,104 --> 00:44:02,509
And whatever you do,
never get into his car.

359
00:44:19,204 --> 00:44:20,546
What do you think?

360
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,068
- It's beautiful.
- Let me get you a drink.

361
00:44:30,059 --> 00:44:33,494
- Do you paint?
- Yeah, it's more of a hobby really.

362
00:44:33,767 --> 00:44:36,668
Pretty serious hobby.

363
00:44:39,641 --> 00:44:41,641
Cheers.

364
00:44:42,462 --> 00:44:44,747
That's the sitting area and fireplace.

365
00:44:44,869 --> 00:44:47,411
Chillaxing room.

366
00:44:47,412 --> 00:44:49,953
This is the place I'm
most proud of right here.

367
00:44:51,069 --> 00:44:55,795
- Who's this god?
- That is 14th century Buddha.

368
00:44:56,248 --> 00:45:00,229
And that was a bitch
to get into this country.

369
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:04,495
It's nice to have friends. You know good
friends that make a difference.

370
00:45:07,488 --> 00:45:09,877
You got good friends?

371
00:45:12,827 --> 00:45:15,463
I mean really good friends.

372
00:45:19,063 --> 00:45:23,085
You're shaking like a leaf. Sit down.

373
00:45:40,068 --> 00:45:42,488
All right... all right.

374
00:45:44,358 --> 00:45:46,759
Slow down, cowboy.

375
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,466
I told you to make it clean.

376
00:49:21,049 --> 00:49:23,246
See you later.

377
00:49:43,873 --> 00:49:46,705
Was it work or pleasure?

378
00:49:50,448 --> 00:49:53,743
I wish someone would hurt me like that.

379
00:50:41,485 --> 00:50:42,663
Hey!

380
00:50:43,586 --> 00:50:47,753
Thanks. I'm going to call him Arthur.

381
00:51:36,035 --> 00:51:37,275
Yeah?

382
00:51:37,605 --> 00:51:41,417
You used an outside individual
to complete your assignment.

383
00:51:41,795 --> 00:51:43,981
That's a violation of our arrangement.

384
00:51:44,103 --> 00:51:48,179
My arrangement was with Harry.
You and I don't have one.

385
00:51:48,412 --> 00:51:50,343
Just the price.

386
00:51:52,571 --> 00:51:55,017
What thinks someone trained
by me would be valuable to you?

387
00:51:55,018 --> 00:51:57,463
Harry McKenna's son.

388
00:51:58,103 --> 00:51:59,975
Does he know you killed his father?

389
00:52:02,918 --> 00:52:07,348
This job needs to be done immediately.
Client's willing to pay a premium for it.

390
00:52:07,696 --> 00:52:10,035
I don't think so. It's too quick.

391
00:52:10,156 --> 00:52:14,368
Your behaviour is making me
and the others extremely uneasy.

392
00:52:15,188 --> 00:52:17,345
You're on a short leash with this one.

393
00:52:17,787 --> 00:52:21,243
The file is a priority.

394
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:27,323
I'll looking it up.

395
00:52:56,672 --> 00:53:01,610
I am one with God.
God touches me and I touch his people.

396
00:53:01,732 --> 00:53:06,673
Andrew Vaughn, 45 years old.
Calls himself the new Messiah.

397
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:09,118
- Reverend Vaughn.
- Just Vaughn.

398
00:53:09,581 --> 00:53:12,577
I'm not a reverend. I'm not endorsed
by any of the world religions.

399
00:53:12,698 --> 00:53:14,806
I am above them. I am Vaughn.

400
00:53:14,927 --> 00:53:18,739
He has made millions of dollars
to his churches, his ministries..

401
00:53:18,861 --> 00:53:22,823
His television programs.
Basically, he is running a cult.

402
00:53:22,944 --> 00:53:26,394
Adrenaline shot to the heart,
12 cc. S and he's dead under three minutes.

403
00:53:26,515 --> 00:53:30,014
Adrenaline's unreliable.
One in four survive cardiac arrest.

404
00:53:30,135 --> 00:53:35,263
When EMT's arrive, first thing they do
is jam you with a shot of epinephrine.

405
00:53:35,384 --> 00:53:38,070
- Which is toxic when combined with...
- Adrenaline.

406
00:53:38,112 --> 00:53:40,946
So, in the off chance our adrenaline
shot doesn't kill him?

407
00:53:41,067 --> 00:53:42,863
The EMT's will.

408
00:53:48,289 --> 00:53:51,809
He left a Bible study group with a
young devotee one night.

409
00:53:52,376 --> 00:53:55,905
They didn't find her body
until two weeks later.

410
00:53:58,445 --> 00:54:02,805
The autopsy said she had an abortion.
She was telling her friends that it was his.

411
00:54:02,862 --> 00:54:05,942
Cost him 22 million dollars to hush it up.

412
00:54:06,855 --> 00:54:08,955
Okay, let's get this over with.

413
00:54:12,908 --> 00:54:15,639
Bless you!
Next.

414
00:54:15,674 --> 00:54:18,855
Why don't you come sit right here?

415
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:22,316
You're new here aren't you?
How long have you been here?

416
00:54:22,317 --> 00:54:23,917
Two weeks now.

417
00:54:23,954 --> 00:54:26,458
- How old are you?
- 18.

418
00:54:26,495 --> 00:54:28,433
Eighteen.

419
00:54:57,974 --> 00:55:00,872
You could've found her someone
more attractive to spy on.

420
00:55:01,693 --> 00:55:03,401
He's still eating.

421
00:55:03,778 --> 00:55:07,754
Soup, salad, sandwich..
Double chocolate cake.

422
00:55:09,024 --> 00:55:11,615
Bishop, I'm hungry.

423
00:55:13,539 --> 00:55:18,743
The guy at the deli, he had
bandage on all his fingers.

424
00:55:19,448 --> 00:55:22,504
If you find a bandage in your
sandwich it wasn't mine.

425
00:56:08,134 --> 00:56:10,097
You're all clear.

426
00:56:30,209 --> 00:56:33,178
- How do you feel, Vaughn?
- How do you think I feel? Where's Frank?

427
00:56:33,299 --> 00:56:35,585
Like I said, he must be here any minute.

428
00:56:36,661 --> 00:56:39,395
Speak of the devil!

429
00:56:54,565 --> 00:56:58,683
Give me something special today.
I feel like celebrating.

430
00:57:02,214 --> 00:57:04,195
I have the spirit's work to do.

431
00:57:04,972 --> 00:57:07,193
Spirits are not working with you.

432
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:24,329
The guys a junkie. He's giving him ketamine.

433
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:26,220
So?

434
00:57:26,257 --> 00:57:29,843
Ketamine counteracts adrenaline.
This won't work now.

435
00:57:42,034 --> 00:57:47,101
I have been tapped on
the shoulder... by God.

436
00:57:47,436 --> 00:57:49,957
What do you want to do?

437
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:53,138
I did not ask this,

438
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:57,975
But my shoulder was touched by
the sword of a king.

439
00:57:58,097 --> 00:58:03,092
He told me to rise up..

440
00:58:04,293 --> 00:58:06,307
We got to pack it, eh?

441
00:58:06,392 --> 00:58:09,748
- Wait, wait.
- If he comes back in here...

442
00:58:10,188 --> 00:58:12,299
Leave your gloves on.

443
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:17,363
Hello?
Yes, yes, it is.

444
00:58:20,429 --> 00:58:21,917
- Hey!
- Let's go.

445
00:58:22,149 --> 00:58:26,452
- Down his throat!... Down his throat.
- Is this the chokee?

446
00:58:30,501 --> 00:58:33,368
If they think that I'm
going to pay full price

447
00:58:33,369 --> 00:58:36,236
for a four bedroom in
this market, they're crazy.

448
00:58:40,651 --> 00:58:43,467
How can I change the world?

449
00:58:43,589 --> 00:58:48,774
How can I be a better man
for my parishioners?

450
00:58:48,896 --> 00:58:53,174
- Let's go.
- Sometimes I wonder.

451
00:58:54,875 --> 00:59:00,459
Sometimes I wonder, if
I have the strength and courage.

452
00:59:01,694 --> 00:59:06,697
I look at myself in the mirror
and think..

453
00:59:09,774 --> 00:59:11,198
Christ!

454
00:59:12,584 --> 00:59:14,384
Ralph, get in here!

455
00:59:14,622 --> 00:59:17,636
- What is it?
- What is it!

456
00:59:19,298 --> 00:59:21,586
- Is he dead?
- Yes, he's dead.

457
00:59:21,707 --> 00:59:23,734
Stupid motherfucker!
I knew this was going to happen.

458
00:59:23,792 --> 00:59:27,429
Get all this shit rounded up and get the
fuck out of here as fast as you can.

459
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:42,151
Try and pick him up!

460
00:59:46,526 --> 00:59:47,308
Fuck!

461
01:00:03,326 --> 01:00:06,128
Go check it out.

462
01:00:24,836 --> 01:00:27,396
Take it off the wall.

463
01:00:30,074 --> 01:00:32,805
Down the wall!

464
01:00:37,516 --> 01:00:39,787
Follow him!

465
01:00:39,956 --> 01:00:43,173
Cover the exit and give me
two guys on the roof. Now!

466
01:01:03,281 --> 01:01:06,066
There he is!

467
01:02:46,476 --> 01:02:49,577
Stay calm.

468
01:02:51,569 --> 01:02:53,185
They're looking for two men.

469
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:55,031
A connected flight out of
Midway. I fly out of O'Hara

470
01:02:55,032 --> 01:02:56,842
and we'll meet at
the house tomorrow.

471
01:02:58,436 --> 01:03:01,527
Right this way. Go!

472
01:03:07,744 --> 01:03:11,454
Andrew Vaughn, the controversial
and polarizing religious figure...

473
01:03:11,491 --> 01:03:13,265
Has been pronounce dead.

474
01:03:13,302 --> 01:03:15,857
The police are still
investigating the shooting that

475
01:03:15,894 --> 01:03:19,702
occurred shortly there after. The
perpetrators have not been found.

476
01:03:42,785 --> 01:03:46,728
All five are killed.
All five are killed.

477
01:03:47,018 --> 01:03:49,763
You probably knew some of
the men on that team.

478
01:04:05,454 --> 01:04:06,636
Terminal B?

479
01:04:07,052 --> 01:04:09,880
Next bus, down the
street, leaves in 15 minutes.

480
01:04:09,943 --> 01:04:10,774
Thanks.

481
01:04:34,881 --> 01:04:37,799
- When does this leave?
- About 15 minutes.

482
01:04:41,875 --> 01:04:43,532
Doesn't give us much time then.

483
01:04:48,046 --> 01:04:50,446
What do you want?

484
01:04:52,364 --> 01:04:55,197
I want to know what you're doing alive.

485
01:04:55,781 --> 01:04:58,875
Last time I saw you
you had a bullet in your head.

486
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:03,068
What really happened in Cape Town?

487
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,440
- Where's the rest of your team?
- They're dead.

488
01:05:07,887 --> 01:05:08,951
Who paid you? Was it Harry or Dean.

489
01:05:10,661 --> 01:05:13,264
Dean paid me a very large amount
of money to kill the others.

490
01:05:14,262 --> 01:05:16,182
Told me to fake my death, dissappear.

491
01:05:17,571 --> 01:05:19,051
You know what else he told me?

492
01:05:19,088 --> 01:05:22,806
That Harry was getting suspicious
about a blown operation,

493
01:05:22,842 --> 01:05:26,523
was about to blow the whistle.
He had to be taken care of.

494
01:05:28,509 --> 01:05:30,342
They knew just the man for the job.

495
01:05:31,718 --> 01:05:33,415
Someone who could get to him.

496
01:05:34,838 --> 01:05:37,293
It's not the fact that
you killed him, is it?

497
01:05:38,609 --> 01:05:43,073
It's that they played you so easily.
That's what bothers you.

498
01:05:43,781 --> 01:05:44,963
Am I right?

499
01:08:22,775 --> 01:08:25,751
- Well?
- Not so good for your side.

500
01:08:26,134 --> 01:08:30,415
Those were two my best teams.
Guess I'll have to send more.

501
01:08:30,846 --> 01:08:34,516
Save the fuel.
I'm coming for you.

502
01:08:41,529 --> 01:08:43,277
When are you going to be home?

503
01:08:43,509 --> 01:08:45,568
- I'm really hungry.
- Where are you?

504
01:08:46,352 --> 01:08:48,697
I'm in the living room.

505
01:08:49,069 --> 01:08:51,671
- Sit down on the couch.
- Okay.

506
01:08:52,217 --> 01:08:54,533
Guessing you're not alone.

507
01:08:55,719 --> 01:08:57,705
There's a gun down the left side cushion.

508
01:08:57,893 --> 01:09:00,232
It's loaded and the safety's off.

509
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:04,078
- But I'm not a lefty.
- Then you're going to die.

510
01:09:05,655 --> 01:09:08,493
All right, I see you when you get here.

511
01:09:18,088 --> 01:09:20,697
I'll be there in five.

512
01:09:31,121 --> 01:09:34,249
- Who sent those guys?
- The man who employs me.

513
01:09:35,735 --> 01:09:39,352
Grab all the gear on the top shelf
and put it in the boat.

514
01:10:32,221 --> 01:10:34,730
Are we set?

515
01:10:39,047 --> 01:10:41,335
Get in the boat.

516
01:10:59,705 --> 01:11:02,531
Do you ever think about the
people you've killed?

517
01:11:05,529 --> 01:11:07,723
No.

518
01:11:08,161 --> 01:11:11,584
Have you ever killed someone you knew?

519
01:11:16,827 --> 01:11:18,750
Yes.

520
01:11:20,713 --> 01:11:23,492
Did it feel any different?

521
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:29,260
Not in the moment.

522
01:11:30,667 --> 01:11:32,836
After.

523
01:11:35,255 --> 01:11:40,976
Some kind of warning or time to prepare?

524
01:11:41,413 --> 01:11:44,714
Kind of time to..

525
01:11:46,661 --> 01:11:49,412
Make peace.

526
01:11:51,891 --> 01:11:54,059
There's no peace.

527
01:11:57,883 --> 01:12:01,294
So it's best not to let them know
when you're coming.

528
01:12:08,301 --> 01:12:10,426
Yes.

529
01:12:11,652 --> 01:12:15,238
I guess it doesn't really matter anyway,
as long as they're dead and you not, right?

530
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:41,738
Hello, Finch.

531
01:12:47,476 --> 01:12:50,906
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

532
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:04,043
I want you to listen to me closely.

533
01:13:04,205 --> 01:13:08,268
You care who I hurt
or who I kill, understand?

534
01:13:11,606 --> 01:13:14,373
Please, no, no. Stop.

535
01:13:19,718 --> 01:13:22,196
You're gonna tell me exactly
what I came here to find out.

536
01:13:22,567 --> 01:13:25,068
Where's Dean?

537
01:13:38,412 --> 01:13:44,227
It's up to you how far I go... with this.

538
01:13:46,498 --> 01:13:48,967
Wrist.

539
01:13:49,956 --> 01:13:51,020
Elbow.

540
01:13:51,202 --> 01:13:54,413
Please John, tell him
what he wants to know.

541
01:14:03,062 --> 01:14:05,823
Okay, okay!
300, Golden Plaza!

542
01:14:06,990 --> 01:14:09,871
300, Colby Plaza!
That's where he is. I swear!

543
01:14:19,204 --> 01:14:21,716
So you're going to miss a good dinner.

544
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:26,768
My god! You bastard!

545
01:14:38,049 --> 01:14:42,000
- Yes.
- How much was Harry's life worth?

546
01:14:44,378 --> 01:14:46,707
50 million.

547
01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:49,316
And here's what I'm gonna do.

548
01:14:49,653 --> 01:14:54,831
Ten million wired to a bank of
your choice within 24 hours.

549
01:14:55,305 --> 01:14:58,984
- It's a good deal, you should take it.
- Not interested.

550
01:14:59,748 --> 01:15:02,748
And a killer grows a conscience!

551
01:15:02,922 --> 01:15:05,747
I see that's a breach of
professional ethic, Mr. Bishop.

552
01:15:06,188 --> 01:15:09,736
Harry's death was business.
Pure and simple.

553
01:15:10,008 --> 01:15:12,605
Well, it's not going to be so simple now.

554
01:15:13,278 --> 01:15:17,579
You got that right. 'Cause now I'm gonna
put a price on your head that's so big...

555
01:15:18,673 --> 01:15:23,411
When you look in the mirror, your reflection
is gonna want to shoot you in the face.

556
01:15:23,521 --> 01:15:27,012
- You won't survive that long.
- You're a fool.

557
01:15:27,198 --> 01:15:29,738
You think you can get to me
before I get to you?

558
01:15:30,101 --> 01:15:32,096
I already have.

559
01:15:37,064 --> 01:15:40,005
- Where's Conference Room E?
- Floor upstairs, sir.

560
01:15:40,127 --> 01:15:42,468
He's in the building.
Get me the fuck out of here!

561
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:43,267
- They find Bishop?
- Nothing yet.

562
01:16:44,866 --> 01:16:49,027
Get out the fucking bus. Move!
Get out the fucking bus. Move!

563
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:19,941
Go!

564
01:17:56,603 --> 01:17:59,522
Back up. Let's go.

565
01:18:48,227 --> 01:18:51,242
Fuck you!

566
01:19:19,728 --> 01:19:22,099
What's the plan, now?

567
01:19:22,861 --> 01:19:24,882
Disappear.

568
01:19:25,171 --> 01:19:29,369
- New names, new occupation.
- Together?

569
01:19:31,512 --> 01:19:34,059
That's up to you.

570
01:19:34,419 --> 01:19:38,808
What you gonna do? Gonna widdle
and get bunk pants. Fold into a tepee.

571
01:19:44,934 --> 01:19:47,495
Want a water?

572
01:19:58,592 --> 01:20:01,362
I've always had this...

573
01:20:03,531 --> 01:20:08,423
Anger inside. Now I feel like I have...

574
01:20:08,743 --> 01:20:13,442
A place to put it. I think I would miss
this if I had to stop now.

575
01:20:19,159 --> 01:20:21,747
I could always go into
business for myself and...

576
01:20:22,538 --> 01:20:25,364
A lot of people out there
who would pay...

577
01:20:26,828 --> 01:20:29,661
And I think you were wrong.

578
01:20:30,666 --> 01:20:34,312
Vengeance is the mission.

579
01:20:53,778 --> 01:20:57,693
- You want anything?
- No.

580
01:21:15,898 --> 01:21:18,396
Last chance.

581
01:21:19,016 --> 01:21:22,013
I'm good.

582
01:21:22,014 --> 01:21:23,056
Steve.

583
01:21:27,028 --> 01:21:30,102
Sorry for everything that happened.

584
01:21:31,167 --> 01:21:35,816
You know me, man.
I give a shit.

585
01:25:21,476 --> 01:25:24,445
Watch number two.
