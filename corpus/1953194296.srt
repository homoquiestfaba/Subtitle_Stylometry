Well, you told me on the racks this is what is called a "pubstomp"?

41
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,500
What else happened on the racks, Bella?

42
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,750
Anyway, girls ...

43
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,000
"Pubstomping" is when a pro like me ...

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
enters a random server and gets the, uh ...

45
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,665
I hear you out there!

46
00:04:03,665 --> 00:04:06,500
Long arm of Law! Long arm of Law! (Law = Law)

00:04:06,707 --> 00:04:08,207
I love these people.

48
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,332
Left Flank ... Laser ¿Occam to three?

49
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,333
As in the Milwaukee Invitational.

50
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,583
Come on!

51
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:23,750
Prepare to take the point ...

52
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,791
Brian! Take the cat for a walk!

53
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,415
First, I will take the cat!

54
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,375
We are as always!

55
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,582
Cheeto ...

56
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,375
Cheeto!

57
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:36,958
Cheeto ... Chee-to! Cheeto .... Cheeto ...

58
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:38,958
What are you doing, guys?

59
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,125
-AFK. - Cheeeee-to!

60
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:43,000
Here! Kitty, kitty ... - For god. Guys ...

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We need a new captain.

62
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,958
Yes .. We seem to have found a server ...

63
00:04:55,915 --> 00:04:57,665
Why we have retrofitted?

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,290
LAW HAS COME TO THE GAME.

65
00:05:05,165 --> 00:05:06,832
Well, guys ...

66
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:07,915
I have him.

67
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,165
I have you, oh, God.

68
00:05:09,165 --> 00:05:12,290
Too much power. As always, too much power!

69
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,583
Run!

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,583
Chee-to ...

71
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,125
Come here, Cheeto!

72
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,790
Cheeto!

73
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,833
Amazing, right?

74
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,083
I still feel that rush.

75
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,958
Oh, my God ... Once I ended up with a whole family with that movement.

76
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:41,875
Cheeto!

77
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,540
Cheeto ...

78
00:05:45,665 --> 00:05:47,707
Cheeto ... good kitty ...

79
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:51,375
Cheeto ... Ah! Ow!

80
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,750
Cat stupid!

81
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,625
Go! It seems that this guy is AFK!

82
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,125
Away from the keyboard.

83
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,915
Let's see if we can have fun along with him.

84
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,540
Yes ..

85
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,250
Mom! Where is the iodine?

86
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,375
Whatever it is, boy.

87
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,250
	It ...

88
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,333
That has been around!

89
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:30,082
Burning ...

90
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,083
Burn!

91
00:07:32,415 --> 00:07:34,582
Well, what do you call this movement?

92
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,582
You know what? That's not really a movement ...

93
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,125
I ... I ... I ...

94
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,333
killed.

95
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,083
You know, is a pubstomp, anything can happen ...

96
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,583
Who was that guy? Right?

97
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,416
Who was that guy?

98
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,041
So, uh ...

99
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,707
Well, I guess, uh ...

100
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,541
Court for ads or something?

101
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,458
- Law has killed, has killed Law. - Briand, are the King!

102
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,833
And still unaccounted for president right now ...

103
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,207
The nation expects ...

104
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,250
Hold on to your joysticks, zoners!

105
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,165
We bring you an alert PwnZwn urgent!

106

107
00:08:15,915 --> 00:08:18,625
VGHS star, The Law has been humiliated ...

108
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,333
live on national television

109
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,500
by a nameless noob ...

110
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,165
In a pubstomp has gone wrong!

111
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,290
Does my computer?

112
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,625
Death of the century! Attentive to repeat!

113
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,500
Our sources tell us that a player not rated, Briand

114
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,291
has already been invited to attend the prestigious and exclusive ...

115
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,625
Video Game High School, a school where students are ...

116
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,957
to make millions with the pros.

117
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,416
Yes, that's true, we were with Brian when the call for VGHS!

118
00:08:44,707 --> 00:08:47,500
Do you want, Briand! - Yes! Brian!

119
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:48,832
Give me a break!

120
00:08:48,832 --> 00:08:51,707
What makes you think that lucky brat who has what it takes?

121
00:08:51,707 --> 00:08:52,165
What makes you think that lucky brat who has what it takes? - Ron ...

122
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,250
Ron!

123
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,750
I totally agree, Ron!

124
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,541

00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,875
VGHS school is most important professional player in the country! - Guys, guys, guys ...

126
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,207
Can we agree for a second?

Can we agree for a second? - Your agreement has been recorded!

128
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,000
Boys, boys, boys! Please!

129
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,582
Just ... look at his video acceptance, right?

130
00:09:05,582 --> 00:09:07,457
It will study physics.

131
00:09:07,457 --> 00:09:09,665
Will study the physics engine.

132
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,541
It will study fine arts.

133
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,833
Will study the arts of war!

134
00:09:14,332 --> 00:09:15,915
Learn biology ...

135
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,625
bathing in the blood of your enemies!

136
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,291
Does that sound OK?

137
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,791
Well, bievenido to VGHS.

138
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:23,958
You have been accepted.

139
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,541
This is really happening ...

140
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,750
Everyone says they do not get, but ...

141
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,457
I have to try, I mean ...

142
00:09:35,457 --> 00:09:40,125
I dreamed of playing for a team since he was "PEGI +3".

143
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,582
I hope you understand.

144
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,291
Cheeto typical.

145
00:09:50,332 --> 00:09:52,665
I will miss this tug of war.

146
00:09:54,707 --> 00:09:57,040
Take care of mom, okay?

147
00:09:58,957 --> 00:09:59,625
Brian?

148
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,125
We will prepare. The reporters are here.

149
00:10:14,332 --> 00:10:15,750
I love you, Mom.

150
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,625
I put more food in the bowl.

151
00:10:22,332 --> 00:10:24,457
Where are you?

152
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,291
I'm going to VGHS.

153
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,791
