<i>My name is Michael Sullivan.</i>

3
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:57,200
<i>And I have a story,
I think you're gonna want to hear</i>

4
00:01:57,255 --> 00:02:01 ,953

11
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,214
Michael Sullivan?

12
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,744
How long have you been in as 
lobbyist for Banco Belasquian?

13
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,924
Two years.

14
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,694
A lot of strategy,
research and reports.

15
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,600
That's a good job. 

16
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
You're not happy there?

17
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,706
No, I'm just...

18
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,369
I don't want to wake up when I'm 40 and..

19
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,675
discovered the only thing I contributed to the world is,

20
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,147
tax shelters, sweatshops and
holes in the ozones.

21
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:40,410
You're an idealist?

22
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,021
For as long as I can remember, 
I wanted to be a diplomat.

23
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,684
I want to make a difference
in the world.

24
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,724
Your father was a diplomat.

25
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,226
Ah yeah. US state department.
He..

26
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,735
<i>Libanon, 1983.</i>

27
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,308
I'm sorry for your lost.

28
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,714
<i>My father passed away when I was little.</i>

29
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:17,720
<i>He was killed in the bombing of the US Embassy
in Beirut when I was 5 years old.</i>

30
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,627
<i>One of my earliest memory is my father...</i>

31
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,959
<i>telling stories about the founding
of the United Nations.</i>

32
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,563
We find a way to end wars.

33
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:31,301
<i>He made it sound like modern day knights 
sitting around the round table.</i>

34
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,902
<i>I wanted to follow him in his foot steps.</i>

35
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,704
<i>By the fall of 2002,</i>

36
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,078
<i>I have applied for a job at the United Nations
four times.</i>

37
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:51,114
<i>My sister said it's because
foreign services is in our family legacies.</i>

38
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,691
 Hey little brother, how are you?
 Hello. Good.

39
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,070
 Sorry. I'm late.
 You look good.

40
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:56,094
<i>And just like my mother,</i>

41
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:58,641
<i>She married a guy
she met while interning in the UN.</i>

42
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,600
So I got you something small
but something else is on its way, ok?

43
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,461
 Hey, Trevor.
 Hey.

44
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,670
Nice cake, Lily.

45
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,437
Got enough Danish Flags?
Yeah.. yeah.

46
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,237
Well..Did you hear anything?

47
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:10,976
Ah..No.

48
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,305
I'll hear tomorrow.

49
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:13,841
But how did it feel?

50
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:15,447
Good?

51
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:16,915
 No. 

52
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,610
I was too nervous

53
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,109
Oh well. It's their lost.

54
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,516
I'm sure you'll get it.

55
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,488
You've been working so hard for this.
Yeah.

56
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,059
Somebody's birthday,
So shall we do cake?

57
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,159
Yes!

58
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:34,689
<i>Happy Birthday to you.
Happy Birthday to you</i>

59
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,365
<i>Happy birthday, Dear Kate</i>

60
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,683
These candidates keep getting harder than 
getting hedge funds.

61
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:57,553
Michael Sullivan.

62 
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,418
I knew his father.

63
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:06,922
Danish passport.

64
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,567
His mother side.

65
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,462
But he's only 24 years old.

66
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:15,967
He'll do.

67
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,211
<i>I thought I would start with some entry level assignment.</i>

68
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:28,793
<i>Instead I got a dream job.</i>

69
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,957
<i>Special assistant to the Under-Secretary-General.</i>

70
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,554
<i>Running the largest humanitarian program
in United Nation's history.</i>

71
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,560
<i>I couldn't believe my luck.</i>

72
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,985
<i>All I could thinking was don't fuck this up.</i>

73
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,840
The program is called
"Oil for Food".

74
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,040
It was created in 1995.

75
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:58,106
By Security Council resolution 986
which is stated that

76
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:01,981
the UN will manage the sale of Iraqui oil

77
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:07,318
And he used the profits to provide humanitarian relief
 in the country to allieviate the hardship

78
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:10,300
which basically means that...

79
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,631
Our office is in charge of trying to feed the entire nation.

80
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,222
Over 20 million people.

81
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,239
You have a little reading to catch up on.

82
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:25,242
We are wholefully behind schedule now 
funding data reports to the security council.

83
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,676
Your immediate task would be to help facilitate its
completion.

84
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,509
Your predecessor was due to brief Under-Secretary
tomorrow.

85
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,743
Tomorrow?

86
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,244
What happened to him?

87
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,944
The car accident in Iraq.

88
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,327
Jesus Christ!

89
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,102
Is he all right?

90
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,263
No, he didn't make it.

91
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,407
A bullet point summary will do.

92
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,742
Pasha will be in his office at night.

93
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,476
Got a couple of minutes, Michael?

94
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,673
Justin Cutter, Central Intelligence.

95
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,076
Really?

96
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,544
Yeah, we come in all shapes and sizes.

97
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,149
Ok. Can I help you with something?

98
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:49,153
Listen. We think "Oil for Food" is being gained...

99
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:52,061
for private gain
by a bad guy or by a bad guy's unknown.

100
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,560
Possibly withheld from the inside
which is where you are.

101
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,999
I just got this job.

102
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,831
I'm not gonna,,
I'm not gonna spoil it through.

103
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:01,564
Oh God no.

104
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,869
Leave that to the professionals.

105
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,875
I don't want you to do anything
that makes you uncomfortable, Michael.

106
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,577
Just keep your eyes and ears open.
That's all.

107
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,208
For God and Country.

108
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,662
<i>I was aware going in "Oil for Food" program
</i>

109
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,322
<i>becomes a something of a "political football".</i>

110
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,601
<i>The program budget was 10 billon dollars a year.</i>

111
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,563
<i>The entire rest of the UN operation budget was only two.</i>

112
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,569
<i>It was crazy money to be had.</i>

113
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,677
<i>Special interests circling like buzzard.</i>

114
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:42,945
<i>The program was simple.</i>

115
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:46,283
<i>Because of the economic sanction post against
 Saddam Hussein</i>

116
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:47,985
<i>after the first Gulf War,</i>

117
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,085
<i>Iraqui ecomony hit crushed.</i>

118
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,458
<i>People were starving and dying 
from the lack of basis medicines and staples.</i>

119
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,073
<i>The "Oil for Food" program was designed to
provide</i>

120
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,431
<i>Iraqui citizens with what they needed to survive.</i>

121
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,460
<i>While at the same time preventing
 Saddam from developing</i>

122
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:07,105
<i>his alleged Weapons of mass destruction.</i>

123
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:11,969
<i>Under UN supervision ,
Iraqui oil were being sold at market prices</i>

124
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,070
<i>to pay for humanitarian aid.</i>

125
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,713
<i>Our job was to keep it funded</i>

126
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,382
<i>by making sure everything went by the book.</i>

127
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,219
I'm here to present the summary.

128
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:25,953
He'll be with you in a minute.

129
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:27,656
This fucking regime!

130
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,653
Unbelievable. Yes.

131
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,489
I solved it and dissolved it as a solution.

132
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:37,365
No, we charges the load of taxes
that should last to outline villages.

133
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,097
They don't get the trust back.

134
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,106
You called this a "summary"?

135
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,006
Fucking "War and Peace"

136
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,445
Sorry sir.
I was trying to be thorough.

137
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:51,980
Thorough?

138
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:53,451
Yes. Sir.

139
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,212
Fuck.

140
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:00,118
Well, just give me the highlights kid.
Otherwise, we'll be here till spring thaw.

141
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:05,221
Yes. We have to decrease the malnutrition rate.
Reduce child mortality.

142
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:10,965
We've also made bid strike in access to water and electricity.

143
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:16,199
There are however some..systemic distribution failures. 
Particularly in the North.

144
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:21,311

The Kurds are getting shortage.
Wheat, Milk, diesel fuel

145
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,442
to the benefit of Tikrit
who are getting seemingly more than their fair share.

146
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,120
Saddam's hometown. What a surprise.

147
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:29,721
Yeah.

148
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,853
There are also all these after service fees
in the contracts.

149
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,025
I'm pretty sure they kickbacks.

150
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:38,655
If you want to take a look,

151
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:42,361
I'm highlighted and aggregated among 
page 26 to 29.

152
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,678
It's a lot of money, Sir.

153
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:56,209
In some places, it is much as 30%.

154
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,089
Sit.

155
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:06,691
Kid.

156
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,727
Sit down.

157
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:15,331
The first rule of Diplomacy is that
the truth is not the matter of fact.

158
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,694
It's a matter of consensus.

159
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,564
The consensus right now is
the sanctions are here to stay.

160 
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,850
The Americans and the British will never lift them.

161
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,000
which means...

162
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,941
that if you want the people of Iraq to survive,

163
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,866
We have to keep "Oil for Food" running.

164
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:31,342
Even with all these wars and flaws.

165
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,712
Sir. You don't...
The second rule is to keep your mouth shut and listen,

166
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:36,354
and then if it suits you, you can talk.

167
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,681
With discretion.

168
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:41,094
Otherwise, keep your cards towards your vest.

169
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,095
Yeah.

170
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,997
Your father was a good man.

171
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,679
You sure be so lucky as to have his heart.

172
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,079
Yes. I've been told.

173
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,577
We crossed paths a couple of times.

174
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:10,678
Must have been 79, 80.

175
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:13,954
What a tragedy.

176
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:16,494
Beirut.

177
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:19,497
Fuck.

178
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:21,833
I'm sorry.

179
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:26,570
It must have been hard a boy growing up
without a father.

180
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:28,838
It was my normal.

181
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:30,234
I had my cry.

182
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,013
Good.

183
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:41,917
Fix your summary.

184
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:43,989
Go home and pack.

185
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,681
We leave for Baghdad
on a red light.

186
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,687
What? You have other plans?

187
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,562
No. I don't. 

188
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,834
Of course not. Thank you.

189
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:03,369
<i>BAGHDAD, IRAQ</i>

190
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,731
<i>I was swapped up in the role I summoned.</i>

191
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,005
<i>I mean this is what I wanted.</i>

192
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,973
<i>High adventure and the worthy cause.</i>

193
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,148
<i>It's like Baghdad was my "Casablanca".</i>

194
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:50,417
<i>More or less sketchy, crazy, dangerous and
stranger than I could ever imagine.</i>

195
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,690
<i>The country live in the state of 
permanant South occupation.</i>

196
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:58,120
Our Baghdad's office is
going to present a problem.

197
00:14:59,098 --> 00:14:59,963
Ok.

198
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,534
The contracted director sarbotaged the reports.

199
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,964
Why? Why would he sarbotage his own report?

200
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,070
She.

201
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,097
So the Security Council will be forced to lift a sanction,

202
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,700
and everybody can cash in on the deals they made
with Saddam...

203
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:14,337
back before he rouge into Kuwait
and pissed off the world.

204
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,016
Jesus H Christ, kid.

205
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,714
I'm gonna have to fucking teach you in everything from scratch.

206
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:25,457
Every six months, we have to justify our
continued existence.

207
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:30,453
Our job right now is to write report
for the Security Council.

208
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:34,226
Emphasizing for the good in
"Oil for Food" program

209
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,694
whilst minimzing the challenges.

210
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:38,962
Not to lie.

211
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,569
No. Never lie.

212
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:44,100
But to chose

213
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,306
our facts or truths with the utmost care

214
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,738
Right.

215
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,978
Can I trust you to do that?

216
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,450
Yes. Absolutely.

217
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:28,483
There she is. Madame Dupre.

218
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,683
Trying to backstab us.

219
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,756
Christina.

220
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,626
Hassan Ghazarian.
Michael Sullivan.

221
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,220
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

222
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:44,667
Photo?
Oui.

223
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,273
Did you get the documents I sent you?
I did.

224
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,466
I even printed them out for you.
Oh Great.

225
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:53,877
It went well.

226
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,318
Sixty percent of the Iraqui people

227
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:03,553
are solely depended upon our supplies for survival.

228
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:07,857
Wheat, grain, milk, medicines.
Essential infrastructures.

229
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,419
During the last of ten months,

230
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:15,190
we have decrease malnutrition rate amongst children
in Iraq by fifty percent.

231
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:19,200
Thereby reduce child mortality
significantly.

232
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:21,233
Ok. Thank you very much.

233
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:24,067
Photographers coming through.
We gonna have a photo opportunity

234
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,708
with Madame Dupre.

235
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,207
<i>It's hard to overstate how badly Saddam was 
abusing his people.</i>

236
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,210
<i>Friends of the régime
gets easy access to the medicines.</i>

237
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,220
<i>Others, less fortunate,</i>

238
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,082
<i>were left to die for even the simplest of diseases.
Wait.</i>

239
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,330
They sent back drugs.

240
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:52,102
 Out of the prescriptions.

241
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:55,932
Thank him for bringing this to me.
Tell him I'll definitely looking into it.

242
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:02,574
He said there's a black market 
with "Oil for Food" appears.

243
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,756
Oh this innocent child.

244
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:18,730
Please explain to her why she cannot have the stem cell
therapy that could cure her.

245
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:23,401
Why she has to suffer because the West begrudges 

246
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,903
Iraq its dignity.

247
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,368
That I can't explain. No.

248
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,819
She asked why you are crying.

249
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:03,874
I promise I will do anything I can to help your child.

250
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,858
It sickens me to have to stand there and 
listen to your lies.

251
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:27,828
It's PR, Christina.
Everyone in the field is working so hard.

252
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:32,369
Well, my report to the Security Council is
going to tell the truth.

253
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,840
Just so you know.

254
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,667
Your report.

255
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,101
The program is a failure.

256
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,525
The sanctions are not working.
How is the program failing?

257
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,589
Medicines getting through.
At what cost?

258
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,881
People are getting basis staples..
At what cost?

259
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,179
Everybody is grifting the system.

260
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,355
Corruption grows like a cancer.
It will never be perfect.

261
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,220
And surely it's better than doing nothing.

262
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,128
Michael, what's the delay?

263
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,929
Ah sorry, It's just.. the security issues.
We'll be on our way in a few moments.

264
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,558
I know what you are doing.

265
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:08,104
You want me to sign off on your moral relativism.

266
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:11,566
So you can throw me under the bus when it's all unravel.

267
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,167
You are mistaken.

268
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:16,510
I just trying to feed a Country.
Enough spins, Costa. Enough.

269
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,375
The facts will speak for themselves.

270
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:22,086
My report to the Security Council is going to tell the truth.

271
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,164
<i>HOTEL AL RASHEED BAGHDAD, IRAQ.</i>

272
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,384
Baghdad is the center of the Universe, kid.

273
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,114
And this Al Rasheed is ground zero.

274
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,258
Boiler room of Diplomacy.

275
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,303
Pasha! Nice to see you again.

276
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:17,972
Mr. Mohammed, my assistant.

277
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:19,744
Michael Sullivan.

278
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,177
Cut your fingers off if you
shake hands with this one.

279
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:25,073
All major intelligence agencies are here.

280
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,145
All rooms above.

281 
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:30,222
Everyone try to bother in its secrets and services.

282
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,090
Information is everything.

283
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,588
The currency, the power.

284
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,888
Look. Listen. Learn.

285
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,662
Everyone has their own agenda,
huh?

286
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:48,466
May be Bush thinks Saddam
disrespected his papa.

287
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:53,109
American convinced democracy will bloom like 
a fucking flower.

288
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,336
Good luck with that.

289
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,480
Putin wants Bush to fail.
China wants a new market.

290
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:02,854
Half of Europe couldn't care less about the Saddam.
Civillians are built of bombs, big oil.

291
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,384
Simply want to end of the sanctions

292
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,720
so he can suck an Iraqui dick ...

293
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,689
So by the way, a doctor told me today.

294
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,060
The bits of medicines missing supplies.

295
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,995
I smell a setup. 

296
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,135
It didn't really feel like a setup.
No. 

297
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,143
Nonsense.
She's not just an effective.

298
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:29,624
She's actively prooving the program's failing.

299
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,276
If we don't do something, this report
gonna be a disaster.

300
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,379
Don't you get the final say?

301
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:35,544
Sadly, no.

302
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:42,559
UN protocols require regional director 
signed off on the report.

303
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:46,054
What's our agenda?

304
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,861
Our agenda? That little girl

305
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,329
at the hospital.

306
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,737
God help anyone who gets in our way.

307
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:58,468
Yeah.

308
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,593
I have a son once.

309
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:23,691
Died from a flu. Just a baby.

310
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:26,863
Can you believe that?

311
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:29,972
And my wife..

312 
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,209
we couldn't make another.

313
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:38,708
Sorry.

314
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:41,208
30 years ago.

315
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,021
How did you put it?

316
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,953
I have my cry.

317
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:51,962
Flu.

318
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:56,967
You tired?

319
00:23:58,303 --> 00:23:59,303
No.

320
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,436
Youth. Fuck.

321
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,800
You know for someone who speaks for the people
for a living

322
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,314
you don't talk much.

323
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:25,626
I couldn't help...

324
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:27,697
but notice you were not surprise when the doctor

325
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,528
spoke of black market medicines.

326
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:32,263
No, I wasn't.

327
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:35,829
Will you tell your boss?

328
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:39,741
Yeah. We already know and 
is approaching the program.

329
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,843
Outside Baghdad is much worse.

330
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,683
Rations diverted, power cut off.

331
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:48,746
Extortion, Bribes..

332
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,187
Well. I'll make sure Pasha knows that too.

333
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,963
You have something you want to ask me?

334
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,202
It's about Madame?

335
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,408
That your boss wants you to find the secret button

336
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,546
he can push and bend her his way?

337
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,151
I can tell you.

338
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,154
It does not exist.

339
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,414
I'm just trying to do my job.

340
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,425
But...

341
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,330
your predecesor, Abhek.

342
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,335
His car accident was not an accident.

343
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:50,471
That's a pretty big accusation you made.

344
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,096
Why are you telling me this?

345
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,743
He was murdered because of something he uncovered.

346
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:21,738
Something in "Oil for Food"?

347
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,976
I don't know. May be.

348
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,883
He was feared for that someone 
inside United Nations.

349
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,450
A facilitator of corruption.

350
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,889
You need to be very very careful.

351
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,432
Good evening.

352
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:21,331
Please.

353
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:32,878
Mukhabarat you see
was concerned..

354
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:35,883
to inspect your sleeping chamber
for the existence of any survillance device.

355
00:27:36,354 --> 00: 27:39,551
This as a courtesy for your security of course.

356
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:42,216
Why don't you start by telling me who you are?

357
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,828
Are you enjoying your visit to Mesopotamia, Mr.Sullivan?

358
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,830
First one if I'm not mistaken, yes?

359
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,365
Such a difficult stressful time for everyone here.

360
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:55,164
The great satan keeps threatening to bomb the city

361
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,605
meanwhile the sanctions cut deep.

362
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:00,216
Baghdad ..
Why don't you get to the point!

363
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:07,711
You will find on the bureau behind me
an envelope containing a small fee.
 
364
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,220
We greatly admired
the work you're doing for the Iraqui.

365
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:14,348
It's late. I'd like you to leave.
Please.

366
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,567
No disrespect was meant by it.

367
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:28,702
Don't forget your envelope.

368
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:59,702
Can't blame them for trying.
It's nothing.

369
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,728
You handled it perfectly.

370
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:03,707
Yeah.

371
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,943
What about what the interpreter said about Abhek?

372
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:10,608
I don't believe it.

373
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:15,252
Perhaps she's a spy for Saddam
sent to rattle us.

374
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:19,987
You look like shit, kid. Fuck.

375
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:21,658
Eat something.

376
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:36,902
I'm sorry.

377
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:40,677
Excuse me.

378
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,911
<i>I've been warned.</i>

379
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,222
<i>But I was still shocked by the criticisims from </i>

380
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,445
<i>UN staffs against the sanction</i>

381
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,250
<i>Pasha was right.</i>

382
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:52,081
<i>Every department had an agenda.</i>

383
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,155
<i>They were working across purposes</i>

384
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,455
<i>and played right into Madame Dupre's hands.</i>

385
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,329
Shut up!

386
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:13,103
You sound like Saddam's puppets.
All of you.

387
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:18,112
Do I need to point out the serious fucking consequences
to Iraqui people 

388
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:19,860
if we fail to..
Sir, your violations..

389
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:22,319
Are you fucking kidding me!

390
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:28,057
It's not our place to question the decisions 
of the Security Council.

391
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:32,227
We implement them.

392
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:36,965
Absent of all politics.

393
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,670
And yes, it's our fucking job sometimes.

394
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,533
But if you can't do it,

395
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:49,074
I suggest you turn in your fucking credentials
and go home.

396
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,169
<i>I knew from my research that</i>

397
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,971
<i>our biggest worry was Kurdistan.</i>

398
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,105
<i>KURDISTAN REGION, NORTHERN IRAQ</i>

399
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:06,995
<i>As long as Saddam was in power,</i>

400
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:10,330
<i>It was gonna take all of Pasha's 
considerable diplomatic skills</i>

401
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,768
<i>to keep the Kurds from undermining the report.</i>

402
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:18,200
The rations, when they come,
I always have half of what was promised.

403
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:21,138
The North is a protector,
so unfortunately...

404
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,375
<i>They even hit harder on the sanctions
than any other regions.</i>

405
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,944
<i>while "Oil for Food" was
providing some relief.</i>

406
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,250
<i>It had helped sustain the very regime that suppress them.
</i>

407
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:33,950
The Kurds have pits of money to buy their own food.
 
408
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,091
From that black market oil!

409
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,693
Mister, if you'd allow me,

410
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,593
<i>The Kurdish conflict with Iraq
goes back nearly a century.</i>

411
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,895
<i>Saddam Hussein took it to a whole new level.</i>

412
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,865
<i>Force displacement,
mass detention and torture.</i>

413
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,939
<i>And then when that didn't work,
resort it to land mines and cluster bombs.</i>

414
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:54,270
<i>Sarin gas and nerve agents,</i>

415
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:57,371
<i>killing ten of thousands and crippling 
ten of thousands more.</i>

416
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,580
<i>A reign of terror.</i>

417
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:04,617
<i>that included the worst single act of
chemical genocide ever committed against the civillian population.</i>

418
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:07,885
Kurds are dying for simply being Kurdish.

419
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,860
<i>And in a shuttle diplomacy between two sworn enemies,</i>

420
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,361
<i>I watched Pasha worked his magic.</i>

421
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,527
It's how the most beloved food Allah

422
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,094
is that which is touched by many hands.

423
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,367
Fuck. This is all I need.

424
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:24,652
Kurdish minister is right.

425
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:26,716
And from what I've been told, 
they're getting completely screwed..

426
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:29,179
I know he's right.
It's in the fucking field reports.

427
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,108
But we have to keep a little bit.
 
428
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,560
The choice can't be to feed everyone or feed no one.

429 
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,575
It has to be feeded to many as possible.

430
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,260
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.

431
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:45,655
I need you to stay focus.

432
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,097
Of course.

433
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,267
Here's your travel rights.

434
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,438
You are connected to Kuwait, lands in JFK
at 5 pm.

435
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:58,734
Dupre is going to freeze you out of the final report.

436
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,470
Her oppose is inditement for
"Oil for Food".

437
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,677
Ok then why am I staying here then?

438
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:10,480
In a few days, you'll receive some photographs.

439
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:13,916
You want Hassan to see them
because you won't understand what they could mean.

440
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:18,752
Your task is to make sure he shows them to Dupre
by insisting he shouldn't.

441
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,332
You asking me if I...

442
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:23,957
a trap. Yes.

443
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:26,603
She'll fall into it,
and we'll be rid of her.

444
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,365
Kid. 

445
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,007
It's diplomacy.

446
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:36,175
Sometimes require removing obstacles

447
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,407
that standing in the way of successful outcomes.

448
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,320
Can I trust you again with this one?

449
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:48,886
I mean what lie am I gonna be telling?

450
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,025
Not lie.

451
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,700
Just the opportunity to draw around conclusion.

452
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,411
Morning.

453
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,940
Just so you know,

454
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:41,701
Madame said you won't be reading reports
until it's finished and she signed off on it.

455
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,737
I'll be by if she wants me to help.

456
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:47,476
People in hell want ice water.

457
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,314
We just ponds in the bigger game you and me.

458
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,484
Sorry, Michael.

459
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:54,958
Hassan.

460
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:59,328
At least she can help me arrange an interpreter
for the field trip.

461
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,865
I want to open one of the boxes and 
check the expiration date.

462
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:09,103
He said he's the company representative.

463
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:10,706
Tell him I want to open one of these boxes.

464
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,746
These pills expired in 1999.

465
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:31,628
Sick people will get sicker or die because of these.

466
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,640
Every box needs to be checked.

467
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,693
And the out of date medicines 
need to be destroyed.

468
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,338
And the Manufacture will have to replace it
at their own expense.

469
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,680
I should warn you.

470
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:55,349
Everyone here thinks I'm your prostitute.

471
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,108
All right. we should split
the check up.

472
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,487
You can't really just ask for a date 
without chaperone for women in Iraq.

473
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,586
There are rituals and traditions.

474
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,265
Do you want to call it off then?

475
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:14,262
Did you tell your boss what I said about Ahbek?

476
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,339
Yeah, I did.

477
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,536
He thinks you might be a government spy.

481
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,354
So are you? The spy?

482
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:38,688
Is that a serious question?

483
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,362
It's a pretty evasive answer.

484
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:45,068
No.

485
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,106
Now it's my turn to ask you.

486
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,679
Ok.

487
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,571
What are you doing here?

488
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:05,251
Well, I'm doing a status report for the
"Oil for Food" program and I'm gonna..

489
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:09,358
I mean today with the spoiled medicines.

490
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:12,692
What you did had nothing to do with writing a report.

491
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,588
You took action.

492
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:18,427
It was risky and rather brave.

493
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,702
Was that just to impress me?

494
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:27,341
I'm not here just to be a functionary.

495
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,578
I took this job for a reason.

496
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,016
Because I want to help people.

497
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:36,380
And I want to make a difference.

498
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:39,821
Make a difference?

499
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:41,982
Exactly.

500
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,564
I will drink to that.

501
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:48,565
Cheers.

502
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:53,930
They're not gonna bomb Baghdad.

503
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,649
Without getting the UN staffs out...

504
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,402
Mr. Sullivan?
Yeah?

505
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,443
This has come for you.
Thanks.

506
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,901
Ah... I've gotta go.

507
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,341
It was on my desk, sir.

508
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:22,442
Are those "Oil for Food" trucks?

509
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,230
Yeah. But I don't want to source them.

510
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:29,505
If they're real, they are proof that we are being gamed
by Saddam Hussein.

511
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:31,735
Yeah. "If". 
I still don't think we should trust them.

512
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:36,107
Using our trucks to deliver weapons?
I mean what the fuck?

513
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:40,106
I just gonna packed them up
into carrier pouch..

514
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:42,019
and see what Pasha thinks.
No, no.

515
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:46,435
Let me show Christina first.
No.

516
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:47,991
No.. No chance.

517
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,350
It's ok. What do you call it?

518
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:52,562
Chain of command.

519
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,366
Ok.

520
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:24,994
Hi.

521
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,696
Hey.

522
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,355
I need to show you something.

523
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,201
Ok.

524
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:39,337
They are friends.

525
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,679
Ok.

526
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,384
<i>KURDISTAN REGION, NORTHERN IRAQ</i>

527
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:25,389
So this place isn't here officially.

528
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:33,360
These are the graves of Kurdish civillians that
Saddam Hussein suddenly decided they no longer needed to live.

529
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:37,732
Gas, sarín, Tabún, Vx.

530
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:40,035
The smell of sweet apples..

531
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:45,668
He doesn't care about your
sanctions or resolutions.

532
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,337
He's the angel of death.

533
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:50,313
Azrael.

534
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:53,912
You're Kurdish?

535
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,013
My parents were intellectuals.

536
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,680
Activists in UK.

537
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:01,771
Killed in Halabdja.

538
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,186
I'm sorry.

539
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,855
Nobody in Baghdad
knows I'm Kurdish, Michael.

540
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:11,262
If Saddam spies find out,

541
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,959
they will disappear me.

542
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:17,402
My friends they have Ahbek
uncovered on criminal conspiracies.

543
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:21,434
Saddam is using to scheme billions of dollars from
 "Oil for Food".

544
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,582
Ahbek claimed there's a whole system of corruption..

545
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,570
that reaches to the highest levels of
the same invested Government that

546
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,347
support sanctions.

547
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:33,179
Ok. How did Ahbek know this?

548
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,616
There's a rumor. Office list.

549
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,955
A list that contains names of people,
and organisations.. 

550
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:42,029
all over the world who
are all getting paid off by Saddam...

551
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:43,932
to keep the system running.

552
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,466
And Ahbek had seen it.

553
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:48,134
Did you bring it?
Yes.

554
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,536
They have had it on its computer.
You sure nobody saw you?

555
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:54,239
The office has emptied.
Everyone has gone home.

556
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:57,006
Ahbek, what's going on with you?

557
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:58,207
I'm going North.

558
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:00,508
Across the border.

559
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:02,313
It's not safe for me here.

561
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:20,130
He made a back up.

562
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,467
But it's encrypted.

563
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:28,568
We don't have the sources to decypher it.

564
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:35,209
Why didn't you take it to someone more senior
in the UN?

565
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:37,352
I mean. Anyone? Madame Dupre.

566
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:39,082
Nobody would listen to her.

567
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,320
It's important who delivered the list.

568
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:45,327
No one can accuse you of being
partisan of...

569
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,225
having an agenda about the truth.

570
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:50,298
I'm not gonna hand this, Nashim.

571
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:52,464
I'm not gonna do that.

572
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,097
No. I don't want that.

573
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:57,968
I just want you to take it back with you.

574
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,702
And find someone who can break the encryption.

575
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:03,470
And then together we can decide what to do.

576
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:32,774
Shit!

577
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:34,310
It's Mukhabarat.

578
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:38,715
Are you fucking kidding me?

579
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:40,883
Jesus.

580
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:57,100
There must be a mistake.
I'm..an UN official.

581
00:43:57,868 --> 00:43:59,199
The young diplomat.

582
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:05,333
You know it's very dangerous for you
to be in this God forsaken desert unescorted.

583
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:10,675
Mukhabarat was concerned 
you might have been kidnapped by these individuals.

584
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:14,674
Consider this a courtesy.

585
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,177
Your paper.

588
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:29,859
I'll tell you this with all humility, Mr. Sullivan.

589
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,465
Cos I'm sure it won't happen again.

590
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:35,606
Your recent visit to the pharmaceutical
distribution service...

591
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,870
that was unnecessarily provocative. Yes?

592
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:42,471
It would be in everyone's best interest
in the future

593
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:46,210
where you decide such inspections
were no longer necessary.

594
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:47,681
They're armed!

595
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:53,249
She is my interpreter. Right! I told you!

597
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:57,685
Stop!

599
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:10,329
Go. Now.
Before they change their minds.

600
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:11,834
Get in the car.

601
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,222
He kept my papers.

602
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:34,687
It's only a question of time now
before they find out who I am.

609
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:15,635
Where is the girl?

610
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:17,264
What girl?
The Kurdish girl.

611
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:19,219
I don't know what you are talking about.
You are lying!

612
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:21,007
I don't know what you are talking about.
Don't lie.

613
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,655
I don't know where she is.
I saw you with her.

614
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:24,408
Yeah. I know. 
But I don't know where she is. Ok?

615
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:26,711
Let me just.. Let me make a call.

616
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:29,948
I don't know where she is.

617
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:32,321
Get out!

618
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:35,251
You have no jurisdiction here. Out!

619
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:48,470
It's Michael Sullivan from Baghdad 
of "Oil for Food" office.

620
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,298
Yeah.

621
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:53,576
Yeah.

622
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:57,477
I need to arrange an UNLP
for one of our staffs here.

623
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:02,444
Yeah.. The name is Nashim.

624
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:05,354
Huesseni.

625
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,502
Hey.

626
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:21,563
I took all I could carry.

627
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,299
This will get you to the US.

628
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:25,733
The High Commission for Refugees 
will help you get a VISA.

629
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:30,177
I don't know. I can go to
Kurdish part of Turkey. I have some friends there.

630
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,941
No. You'll be safer in New York.

631
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:35,349
We'll get you to the US.
And then we de-encrypt the list together.

632
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:40,482
Go. You cannot be seen with me.

633
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,125
Whatever happens..

634
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:47,191
Just promise me you'll let me know.

635
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:50,363
Whatever happens...

636
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:52,969
happens.

637
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:54,470
Right?

638
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:01,944
Thank you.

639
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:05,014
Thank you.

640
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:27,200
Would you please come to my office
immediately?

641
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,710
You really expect me to fall for these?

642
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:35,911
These.. I don't even know what to call them.

643
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:37,071
Garbage!

644
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:41,110
What was the plan?
Shook me to releasing them?

645
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:45,117
And then force me out when the evidence
comes this is false?

646
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:47,247
I'm at loss.
I don't even know what you are talking about.

647
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:48,515
Madame.

648
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:49,957
I've sent some documents.

649
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:51,787
Hassam wants to show them to you
that's it.

650
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:54,260
You are finished in the UN.
Do you hear me?

651
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:56,366
Your career is over!

652
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:58,694
What will you have him do?
He got some photos!

653
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:00,130
Shame on you.

654
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:01,568
Shame on both of you!

655
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:05,304
The report is finished.

656
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:08,338
It tells the truth about the failure of
"Oil for Food".

657
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:10,071
The files are in digital.

658
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:12,612
watermarked, timed, date.

659
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:14,442
And I have secure copies.

660
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:17,848
So you can't change anything
when it goes to New York.

661
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:21,087
The battle is over, Costa.
And you have lost.

662
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:23,817
Security Council will make the decision
based on the facts.

664
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:35,727
She's gone. Pasha.

665
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:38,967
Well. Fuck.

666
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:41,783
Nothing more for you to do there, kid.

667
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:44,977
Take the next UN flight. Come home.

668
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,113
Don't worry about it.

669
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:07,999
<i>JFK AIRPORT,
NEW YORK</i>

670
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,840
Excuse me, Sir.

671
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:12,873
Let me see your passport?

672
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:15,238
Oh yeah.. Sure.

673
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:26,419
Mr. Sullivan?
I need you to come with us.

674
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:49,579
Michael, how are you doing?

675
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:52,982
I have nothing for you.

676
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,480
No, that's ok.
I got something for you.

677
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,355
Christina Dupre is dead.

678
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:04,253
They found her few hours ago alone at home.

679
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:05,991
Heart attack.

680
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:09,096
At least. That's what they're saying.

681
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:16,703
What do you mean 
"that's what they're saying."?

682
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:21,302
What did you think happen, Mike?

683
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:28,309
I... I don't..

684
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,646
I have no idea.
Why would I?

685
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,720
Your boss.

686
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:33,383
What does he think?

687
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:37,450
You have questions for Pasha, 
you should just ask him yourself.

688
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:42,688
Did he ever mention anything about a list?

689
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:46,699
No. Why?

690
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:51,733
Michael.

691
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:56,103
Is there anything you want to tell me right now?

692
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:00,577
No.

693
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:13,829
Thanks.

694
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,496
Hello?
You are home.

695
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:56,840
Yeah.. Yeah..
I just got in.

696
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:00,201
Did you hear about Madame?

697
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:02,478
Yeah.

698
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:05,841
Terrible. Terrible.

699
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:09,452
We have our disagreements
but..

700
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:11,681
this has break my heart.

701
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,322
And the.. the report?

702
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:19,653
Hassan has shown me that he doesn't share 
the Madame's determination 

703
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:21,207
to block the program...

704
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:23,529
He will sign off as her successor

705
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,591
I want everything to get refunded.

706
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:28,868
Madame was wrong.
Being fucking dead doesn't change that.

707
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,196
You have two days to clean this up.

708
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:34,374
What do you mean I've got two days 
to clean this up?

709
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:37,445
I thinking I might need you to present
the oral summary.

710
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:40,082
Wait. Do you want me to present the report?

711
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:42,917
To the old fucking Security Council.

712
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:45,078
Isn't that break your protocol Pasha?

713
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:47,420
I can do what I like.

714
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:51,187
Besides they should be hearing from
somebody close to the ground 

715
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:53,161
than whom else can I toss to do it?

716
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:56,429
Ok. Yeah..

717
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:18,454
Are you kidding me?

718
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,078
This is such a big deal.

719
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:23,315
For somebody, your pay grade
stands before the Security Council?

720
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,894
Yeah. I know it's a great opportunity.

721
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,556
What?

722
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:30,597
Where do you get this?

723
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:32,298
A friend in Baghdad.

724
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:34,966
No. I mean I can't crack this.

725
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:37,664
Do you know anyone who can?

726
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,069
Do you even know what's on the drive?

727
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:44,871
No.

728
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:47,717
Do you know anyone who can crack it?

729
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:49,748
Yeah.. I'll give it a try.

730
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,251
Mind if I.. hold on to this?

731
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,455
Yeah. Keep it.

732
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:56,823
Yeah, I was given this was a possible 
contact number for her.

733
00:54:58,328 --> 00:55:00,092
Yeah. Exactly. Michael Sullivan.

734
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,934
No. I understand, yeah.

735
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:07,470
Just.. the number I gave you.
If you could make sure,

736
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:11,598
you or one of your colleagues
gets back to me if you hear anything at all.

737
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:19,105
<i>Madame Dupre's death hang over
"Oil for Food" program like a cloud.</i>

738
00:55:20,016 --> 00:55:22,314
<i>But Pasha had a clear path for what he wanted.</i>

739
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:29,221
I focus on writing the report.

740
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:35,460
<i>I didn't want anyone to doubt that
I deserve to be in that room.</i>

741
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,969
<i>I couldn't help think about my father.</i>

742
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:43,664
<i>Whether he'd stood before the Council 
like I would.</i>

743
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:46,972
<i>Whether he would think of what he was doing
was right.</i>

744
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:17,198
You ok?

745
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:19,206
I'm ok now.

746
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:25,973
They are one hundred percent fucking 
certainty WMD is in Iraq,

747
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:28,504
and zero percent certainty where they are.

748
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:29,840
Let me call you back.

749
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:31,238
Finished.

750
00:57:31,314 --> 00:57:33,180
Pending your review and Hassan signed off.

751
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,613
That's my boy.

752
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:38,178
Good work.

753
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:43,322
I got a call..

754
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,986
from Oversight.

755
00:57:47,997 --> 00:57:53,094
About your UNLP request
for our sexy little tr anslator.

756
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:54,963
They ask me to look into it.

757
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:57,434
I believe she's in New York now.

758
00:57:57,674 --> 00:57:58,674
Right.

759
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:00,400
She's Kurdish.

760
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,808
She needs an asylum.

761
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:04,243
They killed two of her countrymen.

762
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,112
Kurdish don't have a country.

763
00:58:18,194 --> 00:58:20,185
She makes friends like you everywhere.

764
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:21,697
All the tricks in the book.

765
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:22,989
The honeypot.

766
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,195
CIA calls it a "the tangle" now.

767
00:58:25,468 --> 00:58:27,493
Seduce them up.
Tell them fairy tales.

768
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:30,071
It's not just the russians, notice?

769
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:32,339
CIA.

770
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,175
MI5, Interpol.
 
771
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:37,009
Girl has a big following.

772
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,760
Pashmerga sent it to school in England.

773
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:41,622
Got a phoney paper and a job
in Baghdad, UN.

774
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:44,880
What is she want you to do?

775
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:47,689
Nothing.

776
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,683
I bet she's hiding skills in the soft art.

777
00:58:57,066 --> 00:59:00,001
What you did is stupid and illegal.

778
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,364
I'll make it go away.

779
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:04,211
In future if you're gonna do these things,
you've got to come to me first.

780
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,857
Who gave you this?
It doesn't matter.

781
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:24,985
You've been using me.

782
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:27,089
No.
Yes.

783
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:32,196
You said you wanted to help.

784
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:37,066
Our meeting wasn't like that... I really..
Fucking bullshit, Nashim. I know how this works.

785
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:39,740
Do you?
Yeah.

786
00:59:40,877 --> 00:59:43,869
Yes. Ok. 
I''m guilty of taking a job in Bagdad

787
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,139
and try to find a way to help 
my people.

788
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:49,082
Get free of a dictator who wants to
exterminate us.

789
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,984
And yes, I talked with men 
who might be off help.

790
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:56,552
But I didn't sleep with any of them, Ok?

791
00:59:56,893 --> 00:59:58,133
I didn't have to.
Nashim.

792
00:59:58,227 --> 01:00:01,686
You have asked me to risk my life
for the list..
 
793
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:04,265
that I don't even know where it fucking came from.

794
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,435
This is...

795
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:13,972
I'm sorry but..

796
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:16,212
This is who I am.

797
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,718
Do you want me to leave?

798
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:24,379
Hi!

799
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:25,614
Hey.

800
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:27,549
I came to wish you luck.

801
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:29,851
Hey, man.

802
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:31,106
Knock them dead.
Thank you.

803
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:33,652
Ready?
Yeah.

804
01:01:33,723 --> 01:01:35,987
You'll do great. Relax.
Thanks.

805
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:43,427
<i>In an unusual move at today's
United Nations "Oil for Food" vote,</i>

806
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,226
<i>Under-Secretary-General Costa Passaris..</i>

<i>to present the report 
on the status of the program.</i>

809
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:58,071
The "Oil for Food' program continues to
achieve its core mission of providing humanitarian relief.

810
01:01:58,514 --> 01:02:00,710
<i>The request for continue funding comes</i>

811
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:03,544

01:02:03,853 --> 01:02:06,413
<i>Christina Dupre,

819
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:57,230
I don't understand why you want here,
like me? Why?

820
01:02:57,673 --> 01:02:58,731
I know.

821
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:00,602
Me neither. Let's get a drink, ok?

822
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:01,843
Here you are.

823
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:04,203
My prodigy. Michael Sullivan.

824
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,083
Timur Rasnetsov.

825
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,944
Costa insists you were the hero of
"Oil for Food".

826
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:15,980
And here is Nashim.

827
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:17,993
Lovely.

828
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:20,595
Welcome to the USA.

829
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:21,663
Thank you.

830
01:03:22,598 --> 01:03:23,598
Where is your drink?

831
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:26,734
I think we even have some Arak
tuck away.

832
01:03:30,606 --> 01:03:32,096
So how have you been?

833
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:34,839
Fine. Thank you.

834
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:36,611
Great.

835
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:40,679
Well, enjoy your evening.

836
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:54,061
You must be the young diplomat Michael Sullivan.

837
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,458
My husband is always talking about you.

838
01:03:56,699 --> 01:03:57,632
Nice to meet you. Plesure.

839
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,300
I'm Melina, Pasha' wife.

840
01:03:59,468 --> 01:04:00,367
Of course, Yes.

841
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:04,463
Pasha gushes about you. 
Pasha doesn't gush about anyone.

842
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:06,672
Yeah. He certainly told me a lot.

843
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:08,844
It can never work.

844
01:04:10,546 --> 01:04:13,277
Is that the proud Papa
protecting his surrogate son?

845
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:15,613
Don't patronize me.

846
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:20,979
Is this so unthinkable that
I could be in love with him?

847
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,327
You are what you are.

848
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:28,893
You cannot fool me.

849
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,465
You gave him the file on me.

850
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,001
Listen.

851
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:40,207
If you do anything to compromise the kid
or hurt him,

852
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:43,572
I will have you deported so fast
your hijab would spin.

853
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,681
No.. I have to.. I have to go.

854
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:51,115
My apologies. I have to deal with something.

855
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,452
How long have you known that guy for?

856
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:59,687
He came with the delegation.
We just met. Why?

857
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,558
He was the one who tried to bribe me 
in my Hotel in Baghdad.

858
01:05:03,432 --> 01:05:06,060
Paradics is very well connected.
Could be useful.

859
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:11,072
I've gotta go.

860
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:14,874
What the fuck was that man doing
at the party?

861
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:17,345
I don't know.

862
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:21,110
What did Pasha want?

863
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:25,112
He threatened me.

864 
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:28,691
Your boss threatened me.

865
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:34,396
Hello?

866
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:37,894
<i>Michael, my guy came through,
you better come see this.</i>

867 
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:39,264
You're not gonna believe this.

868
01:05:40,136 --> 01:05:43,003
Saddam. He's been selling Oil vouchers.

869
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:47,736
At that discount, the people who turn around,
resell the vouchers with the going on pay grade.

870
01:05:47,977 --> 01:05:49,672
For huge profits.

871
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:54,844
Saddam gets a kickback,
shares the difference between his discounts on a going rate.

872
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:57,077
How much does he make?

873
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,720
Could be over a billion dollars.

874
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:02,182
Jesus Christ!

875
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:04,617
We know if these are real?

876
01:06:04,694 --> 01:06:05,694
They look real.

877
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:07,596
And it looks like a system.

878
01:06:07,663 --> 01:06:10,758
There's a list of all the major players,

879
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:13,461
Politcians, Businessmen, Bankers.

880
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:16,902
We're talking highly placed people..

881
01:06:17,106 --> 01:06:20,098
at the very heart of most first world goverments.

882
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:24,245
They are taking millions of dollars
and bribes.

883
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:26,438
This is real. Of course, it's real.

884
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:30,310
Well. To proove it, you gonna need records
of the actual transactions.

885
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:33,145
You need to get this to Pasha.

886
01:06:33,255 --> 01:06:34,689
This is an UN internal matter.

887
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:37,119
You do not want to be left holding the bag on this.

888
01:06:37,593 --> 01:06:41,496
Amongst the encrypted documents, 
I found this video codec.

889
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:42,957
How long does it run for?

890
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,662
71 minutes.
71 minutes is a strange time.

891
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:49,868
I sort of scroll through a bit, 
it's pretty much the same.

892
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,004
Zoom in.

893
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,074
Go back.

894
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:29,210
I knew it.

895
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:32,138
I fucking knew it. I knew..

896
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:34,080
I knew that he was involved.

897
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,382
We need to make the list public.

898
01:07:36,685 --> 01:07:38,050
We can't do that.

899
01:07:38,154 --> 01:07:39,154
They'll just deny it.

900
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:42,154
Then all it'll do is destroy the UN.

901
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:44,718
We need to find someone 
to start asking questions.

902
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,872
"Media, The Congress",
the truth will come out.

903
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:50,696
All these powerful interests in play,
they will decide what the truth is.

904
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,892
Pasha will be the sacrificial lamb 
and my career will be over.

905
01:07:53,969 --> 01:07:54,969
You are not part of this.

906
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:56,237
Of course, I'm fucking part of this.

907
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:58,745
<i>I just gave a speech about the integrity
for "Oil for Food".</i>

908
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:01,570
What are you saying? Do nothing?
I don't know what I'm saying.

909
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:24,699
What's going on?

910
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:27,434
Michael! Somebody!

911
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:45,312
Man, you ok?
You need me to call 911?

912
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:29,860
Where is she?
I don't know.

913
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:32,477
Call your friend. Tell him
I will trade what he wants for Nashim.

914
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:33,525
He's not my friend.

915
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:36,662
Pasha, I have a video of you taking 
a fucking bribe from him.

916
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:43,035
You gonna come inside, kid or 
do we have to do this out here?

917
01:09:43,145 --> 01:09:44,442
We gonna do this out here.

918
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:48,348
I take a cut. Sure.

919
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:51,214
Why not? Everyone else has.

920
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:56,488
I put my whole career on the line
for this mission every fucking day.

921
01:09:59,094 --> 01:10:00,994
Come inside, kid. It's cold.

922
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:10,839
Rasnetsov is a fixer.

923
01:10:11,574 --> 01:10:13,201
He's a very dangerous man.

924
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:18,837
Nothing in Iraq runs. Nothing without him.

925
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:20,310
And who wants him?

926
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:21,508
The highest bidder.

927
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:25,483
Moscow, Beijing, Saddam, 
hedge funds, mafia, Greek.

928
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:30,090
Rasnetsov is a bridge between
politics and reality.

929
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:31,725
And whose sides are you on, Pasha?

930
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,994
I thought I heard you coming.

931
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:38,226
Sit down Michael. Please.

932
01:10:41,003 --> 01:10:42,027
I'll make the call.

933
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:47,242
Coffee?

934
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:49,872
Yeah, thanks.

935
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:57,584
Did you enjoy the party last night?

936
01:10:58,220 --> 01:10:59,813
Yeah, we had a great time. Thank you.

937
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:01,955
You left so early. I wondered.

938
01:11:02,491 --> 01:11:05,256
My friend.. She wasn't feeling too well.

939
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:10,665
It's a flu season.

940
01:11:13,235 --> 01:11:14,235
Yeah.

941
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:18,167
Well, I'll leave you to it.

942
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:25,607
They handed her over to Immigration.

943
01:11:25,714 --> 01:11:27,079
Ok. Was she has papers?

944
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:29,078
I think they find them missing.

945
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:31,981
She becomes an irritation.

946
01:11:32,087 --> 01:11:34,749
If she gets deported to Iraq,
they will execute her for treason.

947
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:37,383
I'll send her back to Baghdad,
I still have some sway.

948
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:41,154
No, you call him back and tell him, 
I'm not gonna give up the list until Nashim sets free.

949
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:42,822
That's not how it works.

950
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:45,596
You need to trust me.
I did trust you Pasha. 

951
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:48,137
I trusted you and you fucked me 
in every turn.

952
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:50,897
Look where we are.

953
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:52,767
Committing crimes and taking bribes.

954
01:11:52,841 --> 01:11:54,321
The crime would have been to do nothing

955
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:56,605
to watch innocence suffer and die.

956
01:11:56,845 --> 01:11:59,212
What about Dupre, and what about Ahbek?
What was the justification for that?

957
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,010
We didn't make the storm.

958
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:03,311
We can't control the strom.

959
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:08,446
All we can do is plot our course,
set out sails and try to do our best.

960
01:12:08,691 --> 01:12:10,056
As we did and we do.

961
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,226
Best for whom? Pasha.
Best for you?

962
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,558
Not best for Nashim. Not best for her people.

963
01:12:15,564 --> 01:12:18,363
Look. May be you love the spy.
Fuck.

964
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:21,836
Who am I to argue with a heart?

965
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,002
Don't let her get you killed.

966
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:36,117
We can help her people.
But we have to do it our way.

967
01:12:36,985 --> 01:12:40,353
Bush's coalition of the willing
is going to invade Iraq 

968
01:12:40,556 --> 01:12:43,321
in a matter of days now.
Consensus is changing.

969
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:46,051
If it's truth, Saddam is history.

970
01:12:46,495 --> 01:12:49,624
And "Oil for Food" can be 
successful framework

971
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:52,696
for rebuilding of a new free Iraq

972
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:57,428
in which the United Nations,
not the carpet buggers and craven carvens 

973
01:12:57,706 --> 01:13:00,869
who created this nightmare.
The UN can take the lead fucking role.

974
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:03,669
You and me, kid.

975
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:07,716
We can save the world.

976
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:10,350
And save your girl.

977
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:17,692
Trust me.

978
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:23,023
My fellow citizens.

979
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:26,361
At this hour, 
America and college enforces are

980
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:28,808
in early stages of military operations

981
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:31,896
to disarm Iraq,
to free his people.

982
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,232
And to defend the world from grave danger.

983
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,940
<i>Over the next 24 to 48 hours,</i>

984
01:13:41,216 --> 01:13:45,881
<i>perhaps as many as three thousand..
three thousand missiles</i>

985
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:49,623
<i>Satellite guided precision bombs,
laser guided bombs</i>

986
01:13:49,725 --> 01:13:53,457
<i>would be dropped at various targets,
not only in Bagdad or around Bagdad,</i>

987
01:13:53,695 --> 01:13:56,130
<i>but elsewhere around the..</i>

988
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:08,110
<i>Since we started the invasion,
I was back in Baghdad.</i>

989
01:14:08,477 --> 01:14:10,722
<i>To work on Pasha's plan 
to put UN in charge of</i>

990
01:14:10,746 --> 01:14:12,680
<i>rebuilding the new Iraq.</i>

991
01:14:13,582 --> 01:14:15,016
<i>The sanctions were lifted.</i>

992
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,245
<i>The free market would power 
the country.</i>

993
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:20,115
<i>Free elections would give every citizen of voice.</i>

994
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:22,086
<i>And oil would pay the bills.</i>

995
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:26,322
<i>Pasha still have strong connections.</i>

996
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:29,229
<i>And he kept his promise to me.</i>

997
01:14:36,438 --> 01:14:38,133
Nashim Husseini!

998
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:30,423
The days burned together.

999
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:33,458
Blank pages.

1000
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:42,064
I've missed you.

1001
01:15:49,478 --> 01:15:50,707
I have something for you.

1002
01:15:56,485 --> 01:15:59,216
A new passport and a VISA so

1003
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:04,257
You can stay as long if you want.

1004
01:16:07,095 --> 01:16:09,029
And what about the list?

1005
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:13,690
I gave it to Pasha.

1006
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:20,636
You traded this? For me?
Yeah.

1007
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:22,870
Why?
I didn't exactly have a choice.

1008
01:16:22,945 --> 01:16:24,640
I made a judgement call. Ok?

1009
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:27,738
And what you think is going to happen 
to Pasha now?

1010
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:30,197
Pasha can still do a lot of good in the UN.

1011
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:33,878
You are dreaming.
I'm not dreaming.

1012
01:16:33,956 --> 01:16:36,687
I'm not dreaming. I'm not. Ok.
Consensus has changed.

1013
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:39,557
With Saddam gone, 
we can actually do a lot of good..

1014
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:44,731
Just by thinking you can work with the criminals
to take what you want. You're at lost.

1015
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:48,770
It wasn't exactly a fight 
we are going to win, was it?

1016
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:52,204
I put all my fucking life on this.

1017
01:16:52,574 --> 01:16:54,474
Who are you to decide that for me?

1018
01:16:55,243 --> 01:16:56,870
You said it yourself.

1019
01:16:58,313 --> 01:17:01,078
It's very very fucking complicated.

1020
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:06,318
No. Not this part.

1021
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:09,822
This part is very simple.

1022
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:14,090
I don't want to be a part of this.
 No, no.

1023
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:15,824
I can't.

1024
01:17:16,665 --> 01:17:18,861
Nashim. Wait... Wait. Wait!!

1025
01:17:21,436 --> 01:17:22,528
Nashim!

1026
01:17:36,551 --> 01:17:39,543
I'm told you aren't answering your phone.
What the fuck.

1027
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:43,317
Yeah. I've been busy.
Yah.

1028
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:50,131
I heard.

1029
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:52,823
Your Kurdish took a walk.

1030
01:17:53,068 --> 01:17:55,969
Relationships are trainwreck.

1031
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:00,073
Come on, Kid.

1032
01:18:00,575 --> 01:18:02,805
You wanted a career in diplomacy.

1033
01:18:02,878 --> 01:18:04,710
Well, you're missing a golden moment.

1034
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:09,877
See you at the office.

1035
01:18:28,336 --> 01:18:30,566
Pasha. Are those medical contracts...

1036
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:36,875
I was on my way out.

1037
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:39,213
Pasha.

1038
01:18:39,681 --> 01:18:40,842
See you.

1039
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:50,681
It's good to see you again, Michael.

1040
01:18:58,333 --> 01:18:59,892
You think I like it?

1041
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:02,435
He got the world in his pocket, kid.

1042
01:19:02,704 --> 01:19:05,173
All the major fucking players in
reconstruction.

1043
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,402
I don't understand. When did he get back into this?

1044
01:19:07,509 --> 01:19:11,070
He never left. He just moved into the shadows
when the stakes got higher.

1045
01:19:11,713 --> 01:19:12,713
There was no one else.

1046
01:19:13,215 --> 01:19:15,206
We've been through this, Michael.

1047
01:19:17,819 --> 01:19:19,651
I'm not gonna fucking deal with him.

1048
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:23,224
What?

1049
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:28,889
This is how it works.

1050
01:19:36,004 --> 01:19:38,439
<i>The optimisim of the liberation was
short-lived.</i>

1051
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:43,575
<i>It turned out nobody had made plans what to do
after Saddam was gone.</i>

1052
01:19:44,246 --> 01:19:47,682
<i>The America has purged everyone 
who had been loyal to the regime</i>

1053
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:51,451
<i> which meant there wasn't anybody left
who knew how to run the country.</i>

1054
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,755
<i>Rasnetsov and all the other fixers like him..</i>

1055
01:19:55,757 --> 01:19:59,250
<i>filled that vacuum with power
and now they control the game again.</i>

1056
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:04,091
<i>Iraq spirals into anarchy,
chaos and terror.</i>

1057
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:13,430
<i>All those countries that have been scamming
"Oil for Food" before the war,</i>

1058
01:20:15,277 --> 01:20:17,609
<i>Well, they got ready to curve Iraq up.</i>

1059
01:20:18,847 --> 01:20:20,611
<i>Like it was one big pie.</i>

1060
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:23,184
<i>And me..</i>

1061
01:20:24,186 --> 01:20:26,086
<i>I was going through emotions.</i>

1062
01:20:27,455 --> 01:20:28,616
<i>I lost my faith in it..</i>

1063
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:45,840
Hello?

1064
01:20:46,107 --> 01:20:47,107
<i>It's Nashim.</i>

1065
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:50,344
Hey.

1066
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:52,713
You ok?

1067
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:55,340
<i>I need to see you. Can you come downstairs?</i>

1068
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:58,686
Sure.

1069
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:12,732
Michael. Good to see you.

1070
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:14,702
Yeah.

1071
01:21:14,736 --> 01:21:16,500
I got someone you got to meet.

1072
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:19,731
We need your help, Michael.

1073
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:29,449
Michael Sullivan,
Mr. Shaswar Rauf.

1074
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:31,948
Yeah. We've met before.

1075
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:34,712
He will play a central role in a new Iraq.

1076
01:21:36,958 --> 01:21:39,723
You ever heard of a guy named
Rasnetsov?

1077
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:42,094
Yeah.

1078
01:21:42,197 --> 01:21:43,858
Yeah? You've ever met him?

1079
01:21:44,299 --> 01:21:47,030
A few times
before the invasion.

1080
01:21:47,869 --> 01:21:49,030
How about after?

1081
01:21:52,107 --> 01:21:53,107
No. I didn't.

1082
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:57,773
Well now him and his criminal gang for
"Oil for Food" are back.

1083
01:21:57,879 --> 01:21:59,813
And they're creating a mess in Iraq.

1084
01:22:01,983 --> 01:22:02,983
Yeah..

1085
01:22:07,222 --> 01:22:11,887
You know there was a list of individuals
and organisations that were

1086
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:16,407
helping Saddam with "Oil for Food".
You guys know about that?

1087
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:19,196
 Yeah. There was no way to proof what was on it.
 No.

1088
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:22,100
Proof was in Iraq, all ministry.

1089
01:22:22,704 --> 01:22:24,882
Official files that were taken by
US troops 

1090
01:22:24,906 --> 01:22:26,284
after the government fell.

1091
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:29,437
Proof that is probably be still
in the basement of UN

1092
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:32,146
somewhere if anyone care to look.

1093
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:34,978
Forget about the list.
We don't want the list anymore.

1094
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:37,142
You don't want the list?
Too many powerful people.

1095
01:22:37,252 --> 01:22:38,720
Too political.

1096
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:42,451
It is a coalition of fucking greedy. 
No one gives a shit about Iraq.

1097
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:45,616
Everyone just want some money.

1098
01:22:45,727 --> 01:22:48,958
Yeah, that's why we need to stop Rasnetsov.

1099
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:52,559
Pasha can give him to us.

1100
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:57,465
Michael, we have strong intel 
that your boss is involved.

1101
01:22:59,574 --> 01:23:01,099
Pasha never gonna help you.

1102
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:03,672
Or may be he's just need a little push.

1103
01:23:05,847 --> 01:23:08,976
And we're hoping that may be
you can convince him.

1104
01:23:09,684 --> 01:23:13,245
You think I can convince Pasha?
Pasha's never gonna do it. He's not gonna listen to you.
 
1105
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:17,087
We can protect the UN for any unpleasant throwbacks.

1106
01:23:20,228 --> 01:23:21,228
Diplomacy.

1107
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:23,129
What?

1108
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:24,198
Diplomacy.

1109
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:30,368
Something Pasha said to me once..

1110
01:23:57,499 --> 01:24:00,059
So now you're the one 
working with the criminals.

1111
01:24:01,836 --> 01:24:03,065
It's not the same.

1112
01:24:06,074 --> 01:24:07,564
Why it isn't the same?

1113
01:24:08,009 --> 01:24:10,103
We had the momentum now.

1114
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:13,044
The Kurds are going to be in important part of
making the new era..

1115
01:24:13,114 --> 01:24:16,015
The Kurds been fighting the same pretty much
several thousand years. 

1116
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:18,413
You really think this gonna change anything?

1117
01:24:20,855 --> 01:24:22,345
Who can't say?

1118
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:25,716
But for sure it's not up to you 
to decide that for us

1119
01:24:28,863 --> 01:24:29,863
Come with me.

1120
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:39,870
I can't.

1121
01:25:15,877 --> 01:25:19,643
Neonatal medicine.
Yeah.. There are new inventors.

1122
01:25:19,747 --> 01:25:21,215
French-canadians.

1123
01:25:22,484 --> 01:25:24,929
They want the exclusive rights
to the whole of the Northern region.

1124
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:27,854
That's very greedy.
Especially for the Canadians.

1125
01:25:28,323 --> 01:25:31,190
Well, I can..
They need to be willing to pay hundred grand  

1126
01:25:31,493 --> 01:25:32,493
to make it happen.

1127
01:25:32,594 --> 01:25:37,122
You do the preparations with the Kurds
and the provisional authoritiy.

1128
01:25:37,332 --> 01:25:39,852
I'll handle the rest,
we split fifty-fifty.

1129
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:43,199
Fifty thousand dollars paid off?
No, shekels.

1130
01:25:44,205 --> 01:25:46,333
Christ! Of course, dollars.
What the fuck!

1131
01:25:47,108 --> 01:25:48,108
Thank you.

1132
01:25:50,678 --> 01:25:53,113
Pleasure to see you again, Sir.

1133
01:25:53,181 --> 01:25:56,981
And so much more favorable circumstances yes?

1134
01:25:59,554 --> 01:26:01,386
You must be one of the Canadians.

1135
01:26:01,489 --> 01:26:02,979
I'm Cutter, Sir. No.

1136
01:26:04,058 --> 01:26:05,355
Ah..American.

1137
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:06,689
I wasn't.. 

1138
01:26:07,562 --> 01:26:09,522
You didn't tell me the provisional authoritiy

1139
01:26:09,564 --> 01:26:11,862
will be sending someone for such a routine agreement.

1140
01:26:12,066 --> 01:26:13,295
They didn't.

1141
01:26:13,368 --> 01:26:16,338
We're not exactly here about medicines,
Mr. Passaris.

1142
01:26:19,474 --> 01:26:24,344
<i>They need to be willing to pay 
hundred grands to make this happen.</i>

1143
01:26:24,546 --> 01:26:29,108
<i>You do the preparations with the Kurds
and the provisional authority.</i>

1144
01:26:29,317 --> 01:26:32,446
<i>I handle the rest,
we split fifty-fifty.</i>

1145
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:34,855
Ohh Kid...

1146
01:26:35,223 --> 01:26:38,318
<i>Fifty thousand dollars paid off?
- No, shekels.</i>

1147
01:26:39,494 --> 01:26:41,553
<i>Christ of course, Dollars,
What the fuck?</i>

1148
01:26:45,733 --> 01:26:48,327
It's like a surprise party
without the cake.

1149
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:52,332
What do you want?

1150
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:56,074
Give us Timur Rasnetsov, and resign your job.

1151
01:26:58,012 --> 01:27:02,677
Or I will have to drag you and the United Nations
through a scandals of a stark proportions.

1152
01:27:07,088 --> 01:27:08,249
This happens.

1153
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:11,652
With or without you.
With or without me..

1154
01:27:11,726 --> 01:27:15,219
Rasnetsov will be protected by multinational companies

1155
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:17,059
who have governments who protect them.

1156
01:27:17,165 --> 01:27:20,100
Same people who just brought Saddam to his knees
and put you here.

1157
01:27:20,868 --> 01:27:22,427
Holding court. Judging me.

1158
01:27:23,438 --> 01:27:26,499
You think your place at the table now is not 
bought and paid for?

1159
01:27:26,708 --> 01:27:29,143
We pay with our lives
if that's what you mean.

1160
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:31,444
What you called corruption
is simply the growing pains 

1161
01:27:31,579 --> 01:27:33,240
of the new democracy.

1162
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:39,710
And you are indeed fools if you think
you can put the brakes on it now.

1163
01:27:41,222 --> 01:27:43,816
Let's let the politician worry about that.

1164
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:46,120
We will settle for the rat..

1165
01:27:46,961 --> 01:27:48,656
You want me to commit suicide.

1166
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:50,561
We can protect you.

1167
01:27:50,832 --> 01:27:51,958
You know that's not true.

1168
01:27:52,233 --> 01:27:53,667
Well just set up a meeting.

1169
01:27:54,669 --> 01:27:56,899
Give him the envelope the Canadian's deal.

1170
01:27:57,438 --> 01:27:59,566
We catch him red handed.

1171
01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:05,908
What the hell?

1172
01:28:44,686 --> 01:28:45,983
Not bad, Kid.

1173
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:48,580
Well played.

1174
01:28:59,867 --> 01:29:00,959
He's late.

1180
01:30:03,698 --> 01:30:04,698
Yes?

1181
01:30:29,657 --> 01:30:31,091
Fucking country.

1182
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:37,719
Is it ok if I join you?

1183
01:31:42,463 --> 01:31:43,953
I'm stepping down going home.

1184
01:31:44,365 --> 01:31:46,060
I've lost my taste for it.

1185
01:31:46,467 --> 01:31:48,561
I wanted you to hear it from me.

1186
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:52,469
I recommended you for a position
in UNESCO.

1187
01:31:53,074 --> 01:31:54,667
Special assistant.

1188
01:31:55,977 --> 01:31:57,968
You'll be the youngest one in the whole UN.

1189
01:32:01,415 --> 01:32:02,541
Did you know?

1190
01:32:05,152 --> 01:32:06,313
Kid.

1191
01:32:10,091 --> 01:32:12,025
How can even you think that?

1192
01:32:13,327 --> 01:32:16,558
These fucking lunatics.
They are killing each other everyday.

1193
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:19,996
That's the truth of it.

1194
01:32:23,704 --> 01:32:25,433
That's your truth, Pasha.

1195
01:32:27,708 --> 01:32:29,676
And I'm not part of it anymore.

1196
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:34,205
Don't. Don't do anything dumb.

1197
01:32:34,682 --> 01:32:36,343
You can't fight the storm.

1198
01:32:45,192 --> 01:32:48,025
<i>NEW YORK,
SEPTEMBER, 2003</i>

1199
01:32:49,864 --> 01:32:52,697
<i>I realize everybody knew about the corruption.</i>

1200
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:55,434
<i>They just didn't want to be exposed.</i>

1201
01:32:56,571 --> 01:32:58,699
<i>Every permanent member of Security Council
</i>

1202
01:32:58,906 --> 01:33:00,431
<i>has something to lose.</i>

1203
01:33:00,708 --> 01:33:02,870
<i>Someone on the list who can embarass it.</i>

1204
01:33:04,078 --> 01:33:05,375
<i>It will all be covered up. </i>

1205
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:08,845
<i>The UN couldn't survive these lies.</i>

1206
01:33:10,952 --> 01:33:12,386
<i>I had to do something.</i>

1207
01:33:12,687 --> 01:33:13,950
<i>Risk something.</i>

1208
01:33:15,222 --> 01:33:16,553
<i>To make a change.</i>

1209
01:33:17,224 --> 01:33:21,559
If I tried to list his accomplishments,
we will be here until tomorrow.

1210
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:26,765
But in his forty years of service,
to the cause of world peace and,

1211
01:33:26,867 --> 01:33:31,100
our humanitarian missions,
the crowning achievement would have to be

1212
01:33:31,372 --> 01:33:35,468
his successful implementation and
operation of "Oil for Food ".

1213
01:33:43,584 --> 01:33:45,450
Hi, I'm Trevor Owen from "Oversight".

1214
01:33:45,686 --> 01:33:47,120
I've spoke to John earlier..

1215
01:33:47,321 --> 01:33:49,346
Saddam's palace files..
Yeah..

1216
01:33:50,324 --> 01:33:52,315
Which boxes?
All of them.

1217
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:55,122
They sealed to the public,
but as you're from "Oversight"

1218
01:33:55,329 --> 01:33:58,526
and as long as you don't take anything with you,
go crazy.

1219
01:33:59,367 --> 01:34:00,5 96
Thank you.

1220
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:03,961
Mr. Passaris. Job well done.

1221
01:34:04,372 --> 01:34:05,372
Thank you.

1222
01:34:06,974 --> 01:34:09,306
Where's Michael?
He has cleaned his desk, sir.

1223
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:14,545
I think I found it.

1224
01:34:16,984 --> 01:34:18,213
You know what we're gonna have to do?

1225
01:34:19,553 --> 01:34:20,850
Fucking family.

1226
01:34:58,693 --> 01:35:00,457
<i>My name is Michael Sullivan.</i>

1227
01:35:01,462 --> 01:35:04,898
<i>And I have a story
I think you're gonna want to hear.</i>

1228
01:35:09,003 --> 01:35:11,529
These are the wrong numbers of 
how much money was involved.

1229
01:35:11,639 --> 01:35:14,370
And that is billions. This is not Millions.

1230
01:35:14,575 --> 01:35:15,974
Jesus!

1231
01:35:16,977 --> 01:35:20,504
And this is the list of everyone 
who received their vouchers,

1232
01:35:20,581 --> 01:35:22,242
their bribes and kickbacks.

1233
01:35:22,983 --> 01:35:25,543
You can corroborate the names
with the deposit records.

1234
01:35:26,353 --> 01:35:27,353
They're here

1235
01:35:27,421 --> 01:35:29,355
with the list of contracts on files.

1236
01:35:34,095 --> 01:35:35,688
This is massive, Jesse.

1237
01:35:37,698 --> 01:35:40,724
You realize the minute this breaks
you'll have a lot of enemies?

1238
01:35:42,002 --> 01:35:43,060
Yeah, I know.

1239
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:45,502
We could protect you.

1240
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:47,268
Cite you as "A confidential source."

1241
01:35:47,374 --> 01:35:48,934
No, anonymity is part of the problem.

1242
01:35:49,443 --> 01:35:53,744
If nobody takes responsibility for the truth,
then we are leaving up to consensus.

1243
01:35:55,983 --> 01:35:57,451
I have to own it.

1244
01:36:00,087 --> 01:36:02,818
We began with this evening 
with the United Nations, the "Oil for Food"

1245
01:36:03,090 --> 01:36:05,457
controversies and scandal.

1246
01:36:05,826 --> 01:36:10,559
And the call on the part of the United States Senator
for the resignation of Kofi Annan.

1247
01:36:11,098 --> 01:36:14,159
Obviously, these are serious allegations

1248
01:36:14,268 --> 01:36:15,326
which we take seriously.

1249
01:36:15,569 --> 01:36:20,097
The UN Secretary General today ordered
an investigation on Costa Passaris,

1250
01:36:20,474 --> 01:36:23,637
the former Under-Secretary who has 
whistelblower claims

1251
01:36:23,744 --> 01:36:27,840
was behind the "Oil for Food" scandals
that has rocked the United Nations.

1252
01:36:28,115 --> 01:36:31,176
And implicated a long list of prominent businessmen

1253
01:36:31,585 --> 01:36:34,316
and political figures across the world.

1254
01:36:34,955 --> 01:36:36,787
Incompetent and corrupt.

1256
01:36:40,961 --> 01:36:43,089
The weaknesses is in the "Oil for Food" program..

1257
01:36:43,330 --> 01:36:45,770
raises serious questions about 
the United Nations' ability

1258
01:36:45,866 --> 01:36:49,632
to enforce sanctions and administrated
mandated program in the future.

1259
01:36:49,737 --> 01:36:51,603
<i>The documents for the telegraph
come up with</i>

1260
01:36:51,839 --> 01:36:54,331
<i>reportedly found in Iraq's foreign ministry archive.</i>

1261
01:36:54,441 --> 01:36:57,240
<i> days after the US led the invasions.</i>

1262
01:36:57,578 --> 01:37:00,513
<i>The "Wall Street Journal"
report having documentations of </i>

1263
01:37:00,614 --> 01:37:03,675
<i>kickbacks, and bribes and
 forms of oil vouchers...</i>

1264
01:37:03,918 --> 01:37:05,896
<i>worth billions of dollars.</i>

1265
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:07,684
<i>But according to federal authority,</i>

1266
01:37:07,922 --> 01:37:10,584
<i>Passaris himself has fled the country.</i>

1267
01:37:15,963 --> 01:37:17,294
<i>CYPRUS,
MAY, 2004</i>

1268
01:37:34,114 --> 01:37:35,707
I'm with the "Wall Street Journal".

1269
01:37:37,017 --> 01:37:38,348
We're doing a follow up

1270
01:37:38,686 --> 01:37:41,155
on the "Oil for Food" scandals.

1271
01:37:41,222 --> 01:37:43,190
I come to get your side of the story.

1272
01:37:43,991 --> 01:37:45,356
I don't have a side.

1273
01:37:45,559 --> 01:37:47,049
And it's the kid's fucking story.

1274
01:37:56,704 --> 01:37:58,672
I'm not running away.
Ok?

1275
01:37:58,739 --> 01:38:00,207
Make sure you write that.

1276
01:38:00,441 --> 01:38:02,569
I'm not hiding from anybody.

1277
01:38:03,677 --> 01:38:06,578
Yet here you are in a place without extradition.
It was difficult.

1278
01:38:07,514 --> 01:38:08,879
Write that.

1279
01:38:09,850 --> 01:38:10,874
Complicated.

1280
01:38:12,086 --> 01:38:15,613
Messy was Saddam's ugly nonsense
and the usual first world duplicity.

1281
01:38:15,723 --> 01:38:17,452
But we did more good than bad.

1282
01:38:21,428 --> 01:38:23,692
I don't care what anybody fucking said.

1283
01:38:27,868 --> 01:38:29,199
And the kid did great.

1284
01:38:33,974 --> 01:38:38,571
<i>The choice is I see it,
it's between cynicism and candor.</i>

1285
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:42,472
You know if only we care so much about Iraq 
as said,

1286
01:38:44,218 --> 01:38:47,313
the story would have been celebrated 
as a conspiracy of Saint.

1287
01:38:49,657 --> 01:38:50,954
But the truth..

1288
01:38:53,827 --> 01:38:56,694
The truth isn't about the lie we told each other.

1289
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:01,920
It's about the lie we told ourselves.

1290
01:39:10,110 --> 01:39:14,377
<i>More than two thousands companies
from 56 different countries</i>

1291
01:39:14,581 --> 01:39:16,913
<i>took bribes or paid kickbacks to Saddam Hussein.</i>

1292
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:19,784
<i>Over twenty billion dollars got diverted
</i>

1293
01:39:19,887 --> 01:39:22,117
<i>from the "Oil for Food" program.</i>

1294
01:39:22,623 --> 01:39:26,253
<i>Implicated some of the most prestigious
coroperations in the world.</i>

1295
01:39:28,329 --> 01:39:33,165
<i>172 organisations and individuals
highly placed in the government</i>

1296
01:39:33,267 --> 01:39:34,735
<i>received bribes.</i>

1297
01:39:37,738 --> 01:39:41,675
<i>My name is Michael Sullivan.
My father was a diplomat.</i>

1298
01:39:43,978 --> 01:39:45,772
<i>I tried to follow him in his foot steps.</i>
