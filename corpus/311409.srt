1
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,478
The man who said,
"I'd rather be lucky than good,"

2
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,731
saw deeply into life.

3
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,735
People are afraid to face how great
a part of life is dependent on luck.

4
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:53,822
It's scary to think so much
is out of one's control.

5
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:58,619
There are moments in a match
when the ball hits the top of the net,

6
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:03,457
and for a split second
it can either go forward or fall back.

7
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:08,378
With a little luck,
it goes forward and you win.

8
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,882
Or maybe it doesn't, and you lose.

9
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,721
Sorry.

10
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,728
Mr. Townsend.

11
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,860
Just this way.

12
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:35,113
So the Beach Club Marbella,
tennis instructor.

13
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:38,700
Stanford House.
Forte Village, Sardinia. Nice.

14
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,744
Yes. I've had
a good deal of experience.

15
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,371
Yeah, so I see.

16
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,499
Now, I've heard very good things.
You don't miss playing professionally?

17
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,292
I thank God every day
I don't have to do it.

18
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:50,712
I hate the whole tennis tour thing.

19
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:55,092
Constant traveling, and I was
never going to be Rusedski or Agassi.

20
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,969
You have to really want it.

21
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,929
Not that I have their talent.

22
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,099
Well, your credentials
and references are excellent.

23
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,017
And you want to live in London?

24
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:07,145
Very much. Very much.

25
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:10,440
We have a very
exclusive membership here.

26
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,401
You can begin this weekend?

27
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,863
Thank you. Thank you very much.

28
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,992
That's your sofa,
which also doubles up as a bed.

29
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,870
Which is great, you know,
'cause you can be watching some telly,

30
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,997
ain't got the hassle
of having to go to a bedroom.

31
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,457
You can just open it up, get your kip.

32
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,668
Kitchen just through there.

33
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:33,130
All your amenities, fixtures,
fittings, washer-dryer...

34
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,464
All that stuff.

35
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,009
Lovely view, not overlooked.

36
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,011
So it's all good.

37
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,597
This is 225 a week?

38
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,392
Well, it's London, mate. Bang, mate.
If you don't like it, move to Leeds.

39
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,269
D'you know what I mean?
You got a wok?

40
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:50,105
You got a wok? It's one of those
Oriental, sort of conical pans.

41
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:52,357
No, no, no.
- The geezer who was in here before,

42
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:55,444
he left one in there. You're
welcome to it. I'll throw that in.

43
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,280
I'll take it.
- That's a good choice.

44
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,796
Very good.

45
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:28,977
Ohris Wilton.

46
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,812
This is Tom Hewett.

47
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,856
Very nice to meet you. How do you do?
- Morning. Pleasure.

48
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,650
I think Chris would be
the perfect instructor for you,

49
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,402
and he's very patient.
Great at analyzing a player's faults.

50
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:40,656
I'm so out of practice. I mean,
I haven't played since university,

51
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,992
and I loved it, but I haven't
picked up a racket in bloody ages, so...

52
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:45,619
Don't worry, it comes back.

53
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,330
What you can't do is rush in,
be discouraged.

54
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:49,665
OK.

55
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,834
Well, good luck.
- Thank you very much.

56
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,002
Over here.
- Brilliant.

57
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:09,768
OK, so who was better, or tougher?
Henman or Agassi?

58
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:12,145
They were both great.
- Yeah, I know, but I mean,

59
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,064
you held your own more than admirably.

60
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,566
For a while.

61
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:18,151
But as the game goes on,
you see how really good they are.

62
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,987
Actually, I'll get this.
- No, no, no, no.

63
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,531
No, please, Tom, I insist. I insist.
- No, no, no, no, no.

64
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,491
Get your dirty great forehand off.

65
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,911
Thank you. I'll get the next one.

66
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,747
So, do you need a lift after this?

67
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:34,418
Actually, I'm looking for a music store.
I want to buy some ODs.

68
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:38,213
Music around here?
I think there's one on the Fulham Road.

69
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,382
And they'll have a decent opera section?

70
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,509
Opera? You like opera, really?

71
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:43,802
I love opera.

72
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:47,014
Papa gives loads
to the Royal in Oovent Garden.

73
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,974
I know this is gonna sound a bit weird,

74
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,393
but would you like to go
to the opera tomorrow night?

75
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,438
To the opera?

76
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,982
Yeah. We've got a box
and someone's not coming.

77
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,526
It's La bloody Traviata.

78
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,654
My God. I'd love to.

79
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:05,616
Are you sure it's not an imposition?
Can I at least pay for my seat?

80
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,243
It's not an imposition,
it'd be an absolute pleasure.

81
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:12,498
I just like the fact that we both
share a love for opera. Brilliant.

82
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,584
So?

83
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,670
I said to David and Melissa...
- Evening all. Hello, Mum.

84
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:20,797
Hello, sweetie. Very nice to see you.

85
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,717
This is Ohris. This is my father Alec.
- Hello. Good to meet you.

86
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,719
I hear you're an
incredible tennis player.

87
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,555
I played once, and then I gave up,
then I went back, then I gave up,

88
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,806
then I went back
- Rubbish.

89
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,559
I'm sure Tom exaggerated my game.
- I just got bored.

90
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:34,645
Good evening. My pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

91
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,272
This is my sister... Chloe.
- There's a chair somewhere.

92
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:39,441
I'm Ohloe. Nice to meet you.
- There's two more.

93
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:33,829
Yeah, well, the olds say thank you
very much for the lovely flowers.

94
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:36,999
They said it was very thoughtful,
and totally unnecessary.

95
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:41,461
But off the record, well done, A plus,
'cause they love that sort of thing.

96
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:45,090
Oh, they're lovely people.
And your sister's very bright.

97
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:47,843
Frighteningly so at times. But...

98
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:50,888
Anyway, she thought you were terrific,
and she wanted to invite you

99
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,891
to our country house
with the parents on Sunday.

100
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,894
'Cause they're having a party,
there'll be some good people.

101
00:07:56,977 --> 00:08:01,315
And I'll play you some great music,
because Dad's got an epic collection.

102
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,543
Ohlo-Ohlo, do you wanna have
a knock with Ohris for a bit?

103
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,462
It's just that
it's 5:00 somewhere, darling,

104
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,714
and I've some serious
cocktails to start making.

105
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:28,800
Irish! Have you ever had a
Cuba libre or a caipirinha?

106
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:31,303
It'd be really boring
for Chris to play with me on my own.

107
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:34,097
It's really boring for him
to play with me, but he's a good sport.

108
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,975
And anyway, you've got better
legs than I've got. Ohop-chop.

109
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:40,020
Don't be silly. I teach people
who have never held a racket before.

110
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,940
I'm so bad.
- That's how you get better.

111
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,858
Playing with a stronger player. Come on.

112
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:46,652
OK.

113
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,923
Was I dreadful?

114
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:10,759
Not at all.
You have a very unique style.

115
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:14,721
Yeah, it's called clumsy.
How did you get to be so good anyway?

116
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:17,099
Tom says you played
with some of the real greats.

117
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:20,060
For me, it was a way out
of a poor existence.

118
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:23,105
Caught the eye of a good coach.
I don't know.

119
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,233
It all came so easy at first.

120
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,861
Do you enjoy teaching?
- Not really.

121
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,863
I mean, it's OK for now,

122
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,657
but I'd cut my throat
if I thought I had to do it forever.

123
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,576
I'd like to do something with my life.

124
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:39,246
You know, special.
I'd like to make a contribution.

125
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:42,541
So, you're a poor boy
from Ireland come to London.

126
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,334
I love it.

127
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,837
It's so exciting and alive.

128
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,214
I've never seen so much art or theater.

129
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,466
Not that I've taken
much advantage of it yet.

130
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,219
Well, look, if you'd like someone
to show you around,

131
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:58,015
I grew up in Belgravia. I'd be happy
to take you to all the good places.

132
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,308
That'd be great.

133
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:03,353
On one condition: I buy the tickets.

134
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,189
Oh, dear, is that going to be an issue?

135
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,983
I'm afraid it is.
I'm very old-fashioned.

136
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,777
But actually,
I did read something about the...

137
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:13,155
...exhibition in the Saatchi Gallery.

138
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:17,075
That's perfect.
It'd be my pleasure to take you.

139
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,328
You're very kind to offer this.

140
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,830
Can I at least give you
some free tennis lessons?

141
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,582
OK, it's a deal.

142
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,043
How about Wednesday for the Saatchi?

143
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,628
I can do that.

144
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:31,131
Shall we meet for lunch first?
- It's a date.

145
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:33,967
I'd better get ready.
Your guests will be arriving soon.

146
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,928
Yeah, yeah. Of course. Go.

147
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:39,181
A sweaty tennis player's
hardly what they expect.

148
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,949
So who's my next victim?

149
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,285
You?

150
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,912
I haven't played table tennis
in quite a while.

151
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,457
Would you like to play
for a thousand pounds a game?

152
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:50,919
What did I walk into?

153
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,266
What did I walk into?

154
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:07,603
It's like this.

155
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:10,397
May I?
- Please.

156
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:16,612
You have to lean in,
and hit through the ball.

157
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:22,492
I was doing just fine
until you showed up.

158
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:24,703
The story of my life.

159
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,205
So, tell me,

160
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:29,082
what's a beautiful, young,
American Ping-Pong player doing

161
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,376
mingling amongst
the British upper class?

162
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:40,511
Did anyone ever tell you,
you play a very aggressive game?

163
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,099
Did anyone ever tell you
you've very sensual lips?

164
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:53,482
Extremely aggressive.
- I'm naturally competitive.

165
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,568
Is it off-putting?

166
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:00,989
I'll have to think
about that for a while.

167
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:05,577
There you are.

168
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:07,704
I wanted to introduce you
to Ohris Wilton.

169
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:10,833
Chris Wilton,
this is Nola Rice, my fiancée.

170
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,087
So, you're the tennis pro.

171
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,172
Hello, darling.
- My pleasure.

172
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:19,550
He was trying to have
his way with me over the table.

173
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,427
Oh, really? Yeah, well,
you'd better watch out for this one.

174
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:24,513
He's made a living out of hustling.

175
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,599
I'll be ready for you next time.

176
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:33,021
I'll see you outside.
- Oh, yeah.

177
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,114
She's quite something, isn't she?

178
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:47,327
How long have you been together?
- Six months.

179
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:49,496
Jesus, yeah, six months!

180
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,999
She came over to study acting,
and I met her at a party

181
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,168
that I'd crashed
and she'd crashed, and...

182
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,879
...one thing led to another.

183
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,674
Obviously, it's taken Mother quite
a long time to get used to the idea

184
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,259
that I'm serious about her, but...

185
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,343
To be honest with you,

186
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:05,721
Mother's always had
this funny little agenda for me

187
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:09,057
which doesn't really involve
marrying a struggling actress.

188
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,226
Especially an American one.

189
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:15,189
But I am crazy about her.

190
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:18,942
Anyway, I think we should all go to
dinner next week. What do you think?

191
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,028
I'd love to.
- Excellent.

192
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:24,615
Now, Irish, how about a little drop
of Scottish before supper?

193
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:28,035
Why not.
- Lead on. Quickly.

194
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:10,494
These afternoons have been great.

195
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:14,498
I'm so glad your schedule
allows you so much time off.

196
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,166
Yes, it's fun.

197
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,919
Although it wouldn't hurt
to have a few more pupils.

198
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,131
Do you need money?

199
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:25,008
God, no.

200
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,885
No, I'm fine.

201
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:29,638
It's very sweet of you to ask,
but I don't.

202
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:39,314
I'm only asking
because I care about you.

203
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,877
Shall we go to your place or mine?

204
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,212
I don't think mine's
quite what you're used to.

205
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:06,216
Shut up. I think yours'll be just great.

206
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:29,531
You've been seeing a lot
of Chris Wilton lately, I understand.

207
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:33,202
Yeah. He's very nice.
- I liked him.

208
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:36,038
I just don't understand
what he's aiming for.

209
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,957
He certainly doesn't want to be
a tennis pro for the rest of his life.

210
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,293
Well, I find him very likeable.

211
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:44,838
He's fought his way up the only way
open to him, and he's not trivial.

212
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:49,176
I had a very interesting conversation
the other day about Dostoyevsky.

213
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,220
Can't we do something for him?

214
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:53,597
A place in one of
your companies or something?

215
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,973
Has he expressed a desire?

216
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:58,727
No, but... he's open,
you know, about his future.

217
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:01,021
He really wants
to make something of his life.

218
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,148
Chloe, be careful.

219
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:07,152
Tom's involved with a woman I have
reservations about. Don't rush off.

220
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:10,113
Tom's happy with Nola.
You're prejudiced 'cause she's American.

221
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,074
She's spoilt and temperamental.

222
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,992
She's an actress, they're emotional.

223
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:17,287
She's deluding herself, and she's moody.
She's not right for Tom.

224
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:20,582
Well, I care very deeply for Chris,
and I think he feels the same way.

225
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,043
Who are you talking about?
- Nola.

226
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:38,141
Have you been waiting ages?
- Hello. Not at all.

227
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:40,727
Traffic was awful.
The others'll be here in a minute.

228
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:42,646
They're probably
stuck in it somewhere.

229
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,648
Can I have a champagne cocktail, please?

230
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:50,946
One of your father's associates spoke to
me today about the possibility of a job.

231
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:52,614
Did you say anything?

232
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:57,035
Look, I just told Papa to keep his
eyes open if anything juicy opened up,

233
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,955
so you could have first option,
if you wanted it.

234
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:02,708
You're not cross, are you?
- God, no.

235
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,627
It's extremely thoughtful of you.

236
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:09,214
Thanks.

237
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:11,300
What do you think?

238
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:14,344
I'm gonna have to think about it.

239
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:17,222
I've never really seen myself
in the business world.

240
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:24,062
So, what do you see for yourself,
you know, in the future?

241
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:26,815
I don't know, really.

242
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:31,361
I mean, I'm sure
it's a great opportunity.

243
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:33,155
I think it is.

244
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:36,617
Papa said it's a chance
to learn the business.

245
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,329
And if things go well,
he'll see to it, you know, that...

246
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:42,623
...you move up quickly, or whatever.

247
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:46,543
I've always felt so-so
about office work.

248
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:48,712
It's not exactly office work.

249
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:52,257
Think of it more as a stepping stone.

250
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:53,383
To?

251
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:57,387
To a biggerjob, more responsibility,

252
00:18:57,471 --> 00:19:00,390
greater earning potential, I don't know.

253
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:05,521
You've always said how much
you admire Papa's accomplishments.

254
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,814
Of course.

255
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:11,068
I mean, it's strange,
but coming where I come from,

256
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:14,279
I've always admired
men like your father.

257
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:16,782
Wealthy, but not stuffy.

258
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,867
Enjoying his fortune.

259
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:22,120
Having a grand time,
supporting the arts.

260
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:25,541
Well, he'd really like
to open some doors for you, that's all.

261
00:19:25,624 --> 00:19:27,459
He's a very generous man.

262
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:31,296
He respects how you've pulled
yourself up, against the odds.

263
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:37,845
You don't seem very enthusiastic.
- I'm sorry.

264
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:39,763
I hope my hesitation isn't upsetting.

265
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:42,641
No, no, not at all.
It's just that, you know,

266
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:46,353
you've always talked about
making a contribution and... I'm sorry.

267
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,856
I will. I promise.

268
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,984
Oh, good.
- Hello.

269
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:53,277
Hi, guys.

270
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:55,737
Hello.

271
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:02,202
Don't worry, the traffic was awful.

272
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:05,956
It's my fault, I dragged Nola
to the classic car show at ExOeL.

273
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,041
Really?
- It was unbelievable.

274
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,918
I swear, my trousers have barely dried.

275
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,170
Oh, God. Shut up.

276
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,838
You love your cars, don't you, Chris?

277
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:16,049
I think the old ones are beautiful.
- Yeah, I like the old ones.

278
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:19,970
But Tom likes all those new ones
with the gadgets and...

279
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:22,264
I want an Aston Martin.

280
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:24,224
I drove an Aston Martin.
- Really?

281
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:27,686
Yeah, I used to work for a man,
and I used to wash his cars for him.

282
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,855
He was very, very particular about
- Thank you.

283
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:32,900
Taking care of them, so I had to
wash them every day with a toothbrush.

284
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:37,696
I want an Aston Martin, or one of
those vintage convertible Mercedes.

285
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:40,949
Well, when we're married
we'll collect vintage cars.

286
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:44,119
Just as long as I can have a DB9
with all the trimmings. OK?

287
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:46,788
In fact, Hedley is perfect
for keeping all those cars.

288
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:50,250
In fact, speaking of Hedley...
- Should we order, 'cause he's waiting.

289
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:53,045
Frightfully sorry. I'll have
the baked potato with truffles.

290
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:55,464
That'll be lovely. Yum-yum.
- I'd like the same, please.

291
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:57,508
Nothing to start?

292
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:59,176
Oh, I think the wine list.

293
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:02,679
I'll have the caviar blinis, please.

294
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:05,599
Roast chicken.
- God, boring!

295
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:08,268
Honestly, they have the
greatest caviar blinis here.

296
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:10,062
You should try them.
- That's OK.

297
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:13,065
No, do you like caviar?
- So-so.

298
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:14,650
"So-so."

299
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:18,695
He's been brought up as a good boy, to
always order modestly. I'm very sorry.

300
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:20,697
He'll have the blinis.

301
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:24,493
My goodness, was your father an oil
rigger who specialized in etiquette?

302
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:26,495
He was kind of austere.

303
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:28,705
Chris's dad was a bit
of a religious fanatic.

304
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:29,790
Oh, Christ.

305
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:31,792
After he lost both his legs,
he found Jesus.

306
00:21:32,835 --> 00:21:36,255
God. Sorry, but itjust
doesn't seem like a fair trade.

307
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:39,633
What were you saying about Hedley?

308
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:42,386
Papa's invited us for some shooting.
- Oh, really?

309
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,304
I'd better bring
a different change of clothes.

310
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:46,974
I don't think your mother
appreciated what I brought last time.

311
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:49,852
I think that was your swimsuit.
She's used to slightly more fabric.

312
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:53,689
I'm sure if she knew you'd worn it
in a movie, she'd suddenly find it chic.

313
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:56,358
True.
- Have you done many movies?

314
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,027
It was a commercial, not a movie.

315
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:01,905
But your eyes went straight to her,
if you know what I mean.

316
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:05,659
I don't think my career has...
really gone as planned.

317
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:07,161
Oh, you just need a break.

318
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:09,371
I think it's important
to be lucky in anything.

319
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:11,540
Well, I don't believe in luck.
I believe in hard work.

320
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:13,375
Oh, hard work is mandatory,

321
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:16,712
but I think everybody's afraid
to admit what a big part luck plays.

322
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:18,964
I mean, it seems scientists are...

323
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:22,885
...confirming more and more that
all existence is here by blind chance.

324
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:25,929
No purpose, no design.

325
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,599
Well, I don't care,
I love every minute of it.

326
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:30,601
And I envy you for it.

327
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:33,687
What was it the...
the vicar used to say?

328
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,398
"Despair is the path
of least resistance."

329
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,859
It was something odd, wasn't it?
It was very strange...

330
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:41,236
I think that faith
is the path of least resistance.

331
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:42,571
Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

332
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:44,281
Oan we change the subject, please?

333
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:47,659
Nola was talking about acting,
which is much more interesting.

334
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:49,411
No, I was...

335
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:54,082
...just saying that I think
I'm giving acting a second thought.

336
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:58,587
I just can't bear people
in my hometown to think I've failed.

337
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:01,298
Not that I'm ever
going back to Oolorado.

338
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:02,674
Ever.

339
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:05,219
Have you decided on a wine?

340
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:09,264
Two bottles of Puligny-Montrachet.
Thank you.

341
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:09,723
Good morning. Chris Wilton.
- Rod Carver.

342
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,433
Good morning. Chris Wilton.
- Rod Carver.

343
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:12,726
Good to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

344
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:16,271
You'll be working
under Alan Sinclair here.

345
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:17,606
Hi, Alan. How are you?

346
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:21,276
At first, you may find the
assignments a little unchallenging,

347
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,530
but that'll soon change as you
appreciate how things wash here.

348
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:26,573
It's basically nine to five.
- Yes, yes.

349
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:29,326
So you'll have plenty of time
to keep up the backhand, if you like.

350
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,119
Now, if you're OK with the package,

351
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:33,372
we'd like to begin
the first of the month.

352
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:35,249
I'm sure the salary won't be a problem.

353
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:37,376
Good to meet you, Alan.
- Good. And you.

354
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:38,418
And Rod.

355
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:39,711
I'm sure you'll be happy here.
- I'm sure I will.

356
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:41,129
Exciting things are happening.
- OK.

357
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:48,345
I can't tell you how happy I am
you've taken thatjob.

358
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,973
It's such good news.

359
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:54,685
Here, I brought you this to celebrate.

360
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:57,229
Wow. Thank you.

361
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:01,775
Believe me, in no time
you'll be running that division.

362
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:05,654
You're so much more on the ball
than Alan Sinclair. He's nice, but...

363
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:09,366
...uninspiring.
- It's very rare.

364
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,410
It has some beautiful arias on it.

365
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:13,203
And his voice expresses

366
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:15,622
everything that's tragic about life.

367
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:19,376
You find it tragic, do you?
- And you?

368
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:25,132
I love it.

369
00:24:26,842 --> 00:24:31,346
Let's stay at home and have dinner,
and listen to the tragedy.

370
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:35,934
I'm gonna open one of those
bottles of wine I got you.

371
00:24:36,602 --> 00:24:38,604
Puligny-Montrachet.

372
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:40,981
I never heard of it
before Tom ordered it.

373
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:42,357
Now I'm addicted.

374
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:45,194
Tom and Nola invited us
to go and see a film with them tonight,

375
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:46,945
but I told them we're busy.

376
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:51,658
But we have no plans.

377
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:53,702
Well, no special plans.

378
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,622
I thought we said we'd stay in?

379
00:24:57,331 --> 00:25:00,250
Yeah, but it wasn't written in stone.

380
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:01,919
We could've joined them.

381
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:04,463
We still can, if you'd prefer it.

382
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:09,885
It's... it's not a case
of preferring it, it's just...

383
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:13,972
...we always have fun with them,
and you love films.

384
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:16,350
Well, shall I call them?

385
00:25:18,477 --> 00:25:21,063
I mean, sure, unless you'd rather not.

386
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:24,399
Well...

387
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:27,402
It might be more fun,
just the two of us.

388
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:29,947
The wine, the opera.

389
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:33,033
Absolutely.

390
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:44,378
I just figured...

391
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:48,006
We can stay in any... any night, and...

392
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:51,134
...they're free and suggested a film.

393
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:52,511
What's the film?

394
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:55,222
I don't know, but if you'd prefer it.

395
00:25:57,057 --> 00:25:59,184
I am in the mood for a film.

396
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:06,400
Thank you so much, fella.

397
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:11,572
Hello. Oh, hang on, I'm having problems
with the door. There we go.

398
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:13,824
Hello, sweetie.
- Hi, guys. One second.

399
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:17,452
There you go, fella. Thanks so much.

400
00:26:17,536 --> 00:26:19,913
Good luck with the Sky Blues.
- Oh, yeah, cheers.

401
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:21,957
Where is she?

402
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:25,460
Nola got a migraine at the last moment,
and unfortunately she can't make it.

403
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:27,629
Oh, no. Is she gonna be all right?
- But she sends her love.

404
00:26:27,713 --> 00:26:29,298
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

405
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:32,467
Hell with her, Motorcycle Diaries!
- I bet that was her choice.

406
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:35,053
I can't believe this is
what you really want to see.

407
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:38,891
Everybody likes you at work.

408
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:43,562
Papa says he's heard great things.

409
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:48,317
You're a very clever boy.

410
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:07,628
Hey!

411
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:09,338
Hey.

412
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,006
Hi.
- How are you?

413
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:14,760
What are you doing here?
- I was just looking for a sweater.

414
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:17,638
The kind Tom has. Is it cashmere?

415
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:20,098
It's vicuna.

416
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:21,600
Vicuna.
- Vicuna?

417
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:22,935
Yeah.
- Right.

418
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:24,061
Where are you going?

419
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:26,813
Oh, I'm just
having a nervous breakdown.

420
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:27,856
Why?
- So...

421
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,442
Well, I have an audition
in ten minutes and...

422
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:35,072
As usual, my confidence level, which
started off at a ten, is now at a zero.

423
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:38,784
Don't worry, you'll be great.
- Yeah. I'm gonna be late, so...

424
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:41,286
Are you walk? You wanna walk?
- Yeah, sure.

425
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:45,833
My agent was supposed
to meet me, but he canceled.

426
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:50,170
So that's... awful.
I'm alone to...

427
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:53,298
Would you like me to come along
for moral support?

428
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:56,969
Yes. That would be great. If you...
- Sure.

429
00:27:57,052 --> 00:27:59,137
If it's not a problem.
- It's not a problem.

430
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:00,597
No, it's not a problem.
- OK.

431
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:03,225
I used to get really tense
before big tennis matches.

432
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:06,562
Have you ever tried yoga?

433
00:28:07,229 --> 00:28:09,356
No.
- No?

434
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,580
Hi.

435
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:08,624
Hello. Hi.
- Oh, hey.

436
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:11,502
How was it?
- Blew that.

437
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:13,795
Itjust works, you know, at home, but...

438
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:17,466
I don't know,
I just can never really pull through...

439
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:19,801
...in the end.
- You will. You will.

440
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:21,178
Yeah.

441
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:23,430
You know what,

442
00:29:23,514 --> 00:29:26,391
I could actually use a drink
just to pull myself together...

443
00:29:26,475 --> 00:29:27,893
...a little bit.
- Sure.

444
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:29,937
OK.
- This way.

445
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:43,325
What was I saying?

446
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:50,165
My sister went to college
for a couple of years.

447
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:52,960
But I'm like you, I'm self-taught.

448
00:29:53,377 --> 00:29:55,337
You should see my sister, she's...

449
00:29:55,420 --> 00:30:00,592
...she's very beautiful,
but she's lost in drugs and...

450
00:30:00,676 --> 00:30:03,428
I'm sure she's not
more beautiful than you are.

451
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:08,058
What I am is sexy. But Linda's...

452
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:09,893
My sister...

453
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:13,730
...is classically beautiful.

454
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:18,861
So, you are aware
of your effect on men?

455
00:30:20,654 --> 00:30:23,824
Before my parents split,
they used to put her in these pageants.

456
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:27,494
It's just a joke.

457
00:30:28,287 --> 00:30:30,080
What did your father do?

458
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:34,877
He... left.

459
00:30:36,044 --> 00:30:38,547
And never sent any money.

460
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,966
And my mother
could never hold down a job.

461
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:43,760
No?
- No.

462
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:47,222
Her problem was that she drank.

463
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:51,518
How did you meet Tom?

464
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,690
We met at a party.

465
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:57,983
He...

466
00:30:58,066 --> 00:30:59,776
...saw me across the room

467
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:04,072
and he honed in on me,
like a guided missile.

468
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:05,574
And I...

469
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:07,493
I liked him right off, you know.

470
00:31:07,576 --> 00:31:09,369
I thought...

471
00:31:10,162 --> 00:31:12,414
Well, I think he's very handsome.

472
00:31:12,456 --> 00:31:13,707
Don't you?

473
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,626
Very.

474
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:17,920
And he asked you to marry him?

475
00:31:20,506 --> 00:31:22,216
Well, he...

476
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:27,095
...swept me off of my feet
with presents and, you know...

477
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:29,097
What did I know
about that kind of life?

478
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:32,309
I'm just a starving actress
from Boulder, Oolorado.

479
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:33,810
But...

480
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:38,357
I had another bad marriage behind me.
That's another reason she hates me.

481
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,152
Who?
- Eleanor. Tom's mother.

482
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:44,655
She wants him
to marry this girl named Olivia,

483
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:47,699
who I think is a distant cousin.
I don't know. It's... it's sick.

484
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:50,202
It's such an inbred family. It's...

485
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:52,621
And was it love at first sight
for you too?

486
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:59,628
I thought he was very handsome.

487
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,673
You know, and I told you I was just...

488
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:06,176
I was overwhelmed with attention.

489
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:11,473
So, what about you and Ohloe?

490
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:16,478
She's very sweet.

491
00:32:19,565 --> 00:32:21,567
She is very sweet.

492
00:32:23,861 --> 00:32:25,821
And she wants to marry you.

493
00:32:25,904 --> 00:32:28,490
I don't think her mother
would approve of that either.

494
00:32:28,574 --> 00:32:30,784
No. No, it's different.

495
00:32:30,868 --> 00:32:34,288
I don't buy into Eleanor,
and she knows it, but you...

496
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:37,332
...are being groomed.

497
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:39,084
You mark my words.

498
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:42,504
They almost died when they thought
that Chloe had run off with some...

499
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:45,257
...guy that ran a gastropub in the city.

500
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,800
But...

501
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:53,974
You're gonna do very well
for yourself, unless you blow it.

502
00:32:55,142 --> 00:32:57,186
And how am I going to blow it?

503
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:03,192
By making a pass at me.

504
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:07,738
And what makes you think
that's gonna happen?

505
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:12,326
Men always seem to wonder.

506
00:33:14,203 --> 00:33:17,456
They think I'd be
something very special.

507
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:19,500
And are you?

508
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:25,506
Well, no one's ever
asked for their money back.

509
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:32,012
Where was all this confidence
when you needed it in the audition?

510
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:40,812
I've had too much to drink.

511
00:33:42,314 --> 00:33:44,316
Can you get me a cab?

512
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,360
Sure.

513
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:07,631
Thank you.

514
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:09,716
You were driving a bit fast,

515
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,260
weren't you?
- Good morning.

516
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,221
Which one is he in?
- Second one over there.

517
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:15,264
Oh, hi.

518
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:16,557
So, do you think
he's gonna be all right?

519
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,642
Carmichael came and had a look at him
the other week.

520
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:20,143
Oh, he's so sweet.

521
00:34:20,227 --> 00:34:22,145
The problem with the right hind
is gonna...

522
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:24,189
It should have dissipated fully already.

523
00:34:24,273 --> 00:34:26,483
Tom, can I feed him?
- Yeah, yeah, wack him some hay.

524
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:28,151
Tom, do you think he's
gonna be able to play on Sunday?

525
00:34:28,235 --> 00:34:31,113
Well, he will play on Sunday,
but it's just the problem with the fact

526
00:34:31,155 --> 00:34:33,907
that it's only Lopez who can ride him,
and he's injured at the moment.

527
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:35,826
We're having a bloody nightmare
with injuries.

528
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,911
You're so beautiful.

529
00:34:37,995 --> 00:34:43,208
What would you say to the idea
of taking a business course at school

530
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:45,586
that the company would pay for?

531
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:47,212
I don't know.

532
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:53,969
I've had very good
feedback on your work.

533
00:34:54,344 --> 00:34:56,138
And the beginning of next year

534
00:34:56,221 --> 00:34:59,141
there's going to be a very
significant position opening up.

535
00:34:59,183 --> 00:35:03,145
One that carries a great deal
of responsibility and pays accordingly.

536
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:06,023
Plus, there are a number of perks...

537
00:35:06,106 --> 00:35:10,152
Expense account, driver, et cetera.

538
00:35:10,194 --> 00:35:12,738
We had been focusing on someone else...

539
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:17,159
...but it's obvious to me
that you and Chloe have become close.

540
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:20,621
Although I wouldn't consider it,
if I didn't think you were qualified.

541
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,289
I'd hate to disappoint you.

542
00:35:23,499 --> 00:35:25,042
Oh, excuse me.
- Oome on, Ohris...

543
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,127
We're nearly ready.

544
00:35:27,211 --> 00:35:29,588
I'll bring a gun for Ohris.
- Thanks, Tom.

545
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,552
Never mind, fella.

546
00:35:35,636 --> 00:35:39,223
This is basically a tune-up for the
grouse season, which is starting soon.

547
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:42,184
But it's bloody good fun.
- Don't frighten him.

548
00:35:42,226 --> 00:35:44,728
His shooting's not really up
to his tennis, poor thing.

549
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,730
I'll make an accomplished
grouse shooter of him yet.

550
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:48,982
Don't you worry, Chris.
- Quite right, Papa.

551
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:50,025
Come on, Chloe.

552
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:54,863
Hi, darling.

553
00:35:54,905 --> 00:35:56,532
Have you seen my Strindberg book?

554
00:35:56,615 --> 00:35:57,950
No.

555
00:35:58,033 --> 00:35:59,785
How did your audition go?

556
00:35:59,868 --> 00:36:03,121
Oh, it was pretty awful, I'm afraid.

557
00:36:03,205 --> 00:36:06,041
It's her own fault, bless her.
She just tightens up.

558
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:08,961
Well, I'm sure something
worthwhile will come along.

559
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:13,507
Unfortunately, there's just not anything
right now that I'm that great for.

560
00:36:15,551 --> 00:36:17,803
So, how long do you keep it up?

561
00:36:20,138 --> 00:36:21,682
How long?

562
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:25,060
Well, if time passes
and nothing significant materializes,

563
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:29,690
how long do you keep on going
before you decide that?

564
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:32,401
To try something else?

565
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:35,154
I hardly think Nola's
reached that point, Mother.

566
00:36:35,237 --> 00:36:36,196
I'm not saying that.

567
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,991
All I'm saying is
you give acting a try for a time,

568
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:42,744
and if you keep being disappointed
you have to ask yourself the question,

569
00:36:42,828 --> 00:36:46,957
"Is this really what I want in my life?
Is this what I want?"

570
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,293
Well, I do ask myself that.

571
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:51,503
See? It's only logical, Tom.

572
00:36:51,587 --> 00:36:53,881
Especially for a woman.

573
00:36:53,964 --> 00:36:56,758
It's a particularly
cruel business for a woman,

574
00:36:56,842 --> 00:36:59,595
and as you get older and time passes,

575
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:01,930
if nothing happens
it gets harder and harder.

576
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:05,475
Eleanor,
Nola isn't exactly over the hill.

577
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:09,146
I'm not saying now.

578
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:13,150
But I'm a great one
for facing up to realities.

579
00:37:13,317 --> 00:37:16,278
Your take on these realities
is your own opinion and nothing else.

580
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,822
Frankly, not everybody else
is interested in hearing about it.

581
00:37:18,906 --> 00:37:21,074
Tom, don't raise your voice
to your mother, please.

582
00:37:21,158 --> 00:37:23,160
I'm not raising my voice.
And I'm sorry, Papa,

583
00:37:23,243 --> 00:37:27,164
but she's always on Nola's case,
continually discouraging her via...

584
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:28,624
...innuendos.

585
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:31,335
All I'm saying is acting's
so will-o'-the-wisp.

586
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:33,420
Those that have it, know it right off.

587
00:37:33,504 --> 00:37:36,048
To pursue it because
you don't want to admit defeat

588
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:38,967
to friends back home is,
frankly, unrealistic.

589
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:41,053
I'm sorry, but that's the way I feel.

590
00:37:41,678 --> 00:37:42,971
Excuse me.

591
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:44,598
Nola.

592
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:46,892
It's OK. I'd like to be alone, thanks.

593
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:49,895
Well, thank you very much. And I'm
sorry if I'm raising my voice now,

594
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:52,147
but you know that's her
Achilles heel, emotionally.

595
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:55,818
He's right, Eleanor. I think
you've had one too many G and T's.

596
00:39:11,602 --> 00:39:13,103
I was looking for you.

597
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:17,232
I was upset.
I just wanted to be alone.

598
00:39:17,316 --> 00:39:19,318
I don't mean to intrude.

599
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:22,446
I need a drink.

600
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:25,282
I like you when you drink.
You get flirtatious.

601
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:27,367
Do I?
- Yeah.

602
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:29,745
Oonfident.
- I don't think this was a good idea.

603
00:39:29,828 --> 00:39:31,455
You shouldn't have followed me here.

604
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:33,540
Do you feel guilty?

605
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:36,835
Do you?

606
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:46,803
We can't do this.

607
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:49,473
I know.

608
00:39:56,647 --> 00:39:58,649
This can't lead anyplace.

609
00:41:14,558 --> 00:41:15,517
Hello.

610
00:41:16,602 --> 00:41:18,604
Darling, I think it's for you.

611
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:21,440
But take it outside.

612
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:39,082
Well, there's hope, at least.

613
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:41,376
When's the callback?

614
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,589
Just let me know
when you hear anything at all,

615
00:41:45,672 --> 00:41:48,884
'cause I really think
I could be great in this part.

616
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,721
Yeah. OK.

617
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:53,889
Bye.

618
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,683
Why have you been so cold to me?

619
00:41:56,767 --> 00:41:59,478
I haven't been cold.
- Yes, you have.

620
00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:01,730
Ever since we came back
from the countryside

621
00:42:01,772 --> 00:42:04,191
you've been distant, evasive.

622
00:42:04,274 --> 00:42:06,401
I don't want to encourage anything.

623
00:42:06,443 --> 00:42:08,779
What happened, happened, Chris.

624
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:11,824
I mean... The moment was very
out of control for many reasons.

625
00:42:11,907 --> 00:42:14,576
I was upset, I was drinking,
and the storm was overpowering.

626
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:17,371
Oh, stop rationalizing.
- I'm not rationalizing.

627
00:42:17,454 --> 00:42:21,500
Passions are passions, but we're
both very involved with other people.

628
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:24,837
You're not such a good actress,
you know. It's not possible.

629
00:42:25,462 --> 00:42:28,590
Look, you daydreamed
about making love to me,

630
00:42:28,632 --> 00:42:31,426
and I'm not saying the fantasy
didn't cross my mind, OK?

631
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,803
We had our moment.

632
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:35,389
But, you know, let's move on,
get back to reality.

633
00:42:35,472 --> 00:42:37,724
Chris, we're gonna be
brother and sister-in-law.

634
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:40,727
You were exactly
as I pictured you'd be making love.

635
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:43,063
Chris, forget it. It's over.

636
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,704
Thanks. Henry!

637
00:42:58,787 --> 00:43:01,456
Hey. How are you?
- Chris. All right.

638
00:43:01,498 --> 00:43:03,041
Look at you.
- Good to see you.

639
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:05,377
Looks like you're doing
all right for yourself, aren't you?

640
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,171
Thanks.
- You still doing the tennis tour?

641
00:43:07,254 --> 00:43:08,964
Yeah, I love it. I love it.
Look at this car.

642
00:43:09,047 --> 00:43:11,425
Oh, don't worry, it's not mine.
It's the company's.

643
00:43:11,508 --> 00:43:14,094
Yeah, I know you found it
a bit of a grind, didn't you?

644
00:43:14,178 --> 00:43:16,889
But I'm still circling the globe,
deluding myself.

645
00:43:16,972 --> 00:43:18,682
I just couldn't stand it.

646
00:43:18,765 --> 00:43:21,101
No. No, I heard you went into business.

647
00:43:21,185 --> 00:43:23,395
I'm a wheel in an office,
if you can believe it.

648
00:43:23,478 --> 00:43:25,898
A big wheel.
- It's who you know, Henry.

649
00:43:25,981 --> 00:43:28,484
I got involved with a woman.
Very nice.

650
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:30,152
Family's got nothing but money.

651
00:43:30,235 --> 00:43:33,447
Big estate, servants, polo ponies.
All quite lovely.

652
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:34,573
Hey, look, I understand.

653
00:43:34,656 --> 00:43:37,326
It beats getting your heart broken
all the time by the top seeds.

654
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:39,953
Isn't it amazing how much of life
turns on whether the ball

655
00:43:40,037 --> 00:43:41,497
goes over the net
or comes right back at you?

656
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,499
I always admired
your game though, you know?

657
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,000
Thanks.
- You were very steady.

658
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:46,627
Cool under pressure, but creative.

659
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:48,879
You could be a poet
with the racket like Laver was.

660
00:43:48,962 --> 00:43:50,380
I lost to you as much as I beat you.

661
00:43:50,464 --> 00:43:52,257
No. When I played you,
you never beat yourself.

662
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:54,301
I'm telling you, a couple
of bounces the other way,

663
00:43:54,384 --> 00:43:56,678
you might've beaten
some of those top seeds.

664
00:43:56,762 --> 00:43:58,055
Listen, can I buy you lunch?

665
00:43:58,138 --> 00:43:59,848
That's...
What about next time I'm in town?

666
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,600
Give me your number.
- Oertainly.

667
00:44:02,059 --> 00:44:04,686
I'm moving into a new flat,
so this is my business card.

668
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:07,064
You should call me anytime.
- Very impressive.

669
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:08,315
So good to see you, Henry.

670
00:44:08,398 --> 00:44:09,733
You look well.
- And you, mate.

671
00:44:09,817 --> 00:44:11,193
You look very, very well.
- I can buy us lunch.

672
00:44:11,235 --> 00:44:13,320
Put it on the expense account, so...
- Very well.

673
00:44:13,403 --> 00:44:14,446
...do call.
- Very good. Yeah, yeah.

674
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:16,365
All right.
- Bye.

675
00:44:16,448 --> 00:44:17,825
Oh, my God.
- Right there.

676
00:44:17,908 --> 00:44:21,161
She's got glasses on.
- But why on earth?

677
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:23,205
Why on earth would
your mother invite her here?

678
00:44:23,288 --> 00:44:25,833
She met her at the supermarket
yesterday and invited her...

679
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:26,875
The supermarket?
- Yes.

680
00:44:26,959 --> 00:44:29,211
Can you play the piano?
- No, I'm terrible at the piano.

681
00:44:29,294 --> 00:44:31,338
So, when are you two getting married?
- Mummy!

682
00:44:31,421 --> 00:44:33,382
Oh, gosh, Eleanor!
- Oh, don't look so surprised.

683
00:44:33,423 --> 00:44:34,424
Stop it.

684
00:44:34,508 --> 00:44:36,552
You've been like two peas
in a pod for a long time now.

685
00:44:36,635 --> 00:44:38,428
Don't tell me the subject
hasn't come up.

686
00:44:38,512 --> 00:44:39,721
Mummy, come with me.
- Oh, dear.

687
00:44:39,805 --> 00:44:43,225
You need a strong cup of coffee.
Come on.

688
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:45,561
Eleanor doesn't hold back
when she's had a few.

689
00:44:45,644 --> 00:44:48,689
Look, it's a reasonable question.
Chloe and I have discussed it.

690
00:44:48,772 --> 00:44:51,024
Eleanor and I would be delighted
to welcome you to the family.

691
00:44:51,108 --> 00:44:52,484
Tom would love
having you as a brother-in-law,

692
00:44:52,568 --> 00:44:54,653
and whatever you two need,
you can always rely on us.

693
00:44:54,736 --> 00:44:56,071
I appreciate that.

694
00:45:34,526 --> 00:45:36,695
Darling, one second.
I just think we...

695
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,452
You two have met, haven't you?
I'm sure you've met.

696
00:45:43,494 --> 00:45:45,621
I'm sorry. Who'd have thought?

697
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:47,664
What, that we were
hiding in the pantry?

698
00:45:47,748 --> 00:45:49,124
It was all her fault, you know.

699
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:51,960
Like, how can I help it if she
gets turned on by sexual intimacy

700
00:45:52,002 --> 00:45:54,004
in places that we know
we're gonna get caught?

701
00:45:54,087 --> 00:45:56,507
You were... You!
The risky business was your idea.

702
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:58,592
All men who see you want to attack you.

703
00:45:59,927 --> 00:46:01,929
Isn't that right, Ohristopher?

704
00:46:03,055 --> 00:46:04,515
Oh, God, are you all right?

705
00:46:05,432 --> 00:46:06,934
I'm fine.

706
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:09,394
I shouldn't drink on an empty stomach.

707
00:46:12,105 --> 00:46:15,317
I now pronounce you man and wife.

708
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,444
You may kiss the bride.

709
00:46:33,418 --> 00:46:35,420
Oh, my God.

710
00:46:35,504 --> 00:46:37,756
This is incredible.
- Isn't it?

711
00:46:38,799 --> 00:46:40,801
What's up here?
- That's the bedroom.

712
00:46:40,884 --> 00:46:42,845
There's another bedroom through there.

713
00:46:42,886 --> 00:46:44,888
The bathroom and a kitchen.

714
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:46,974
Little terrace.
- Wow.

715
00:46:47,057 --> 00:46:50,102
But look at this view.
- Oh, it's breathtaking.

716
00:46:50,185 --> 00:46:53,814
I just... wish I could afford it.
- Oh, don't bring that up again.

717
00:46:53,897 --> 00:46:55,858
You know it gives Papa pleasure to help.

718
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,696
Come on.
The light coming through every day.

719
00:47:00,779 --> 00:47:02,948
It's beautiful. But it's huge!

720
00:47:03,031 --> 00:47:04,992
I'm gonna get lost in here or something.

721
00:47:07,828 --> 00:47:10,205
Did I tell you I'm scared of heights?
- Really?

722
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:12,291
Yeah.
- That could be a problem.

723
00:47:14,084 --> 00:47:16,378
I want you to make me pregnant.

724
00:47:17,421 --> 00:47:20,757
Chloe... We discussed this.

725
00:47:20,841 --> 00:47:22,718
It's very quick.

726
00:47:22,801 --> 00:47:25,888
It's not quick, we've been
sleeping together for ages.

727
00:47:26,638 --> 00:47:29,641
And I want three children,
and I want them when I'm young.

728
00:47:31,768 --> 00:47:34,730
Come on, you can do it,
you've got a powerful serve.

729
00:47:41,612 --> 00:47:44,198
Hey! Where are you?

730
00:47:45,491 --> 00:47:47,493
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

731
00:47:48,577 --> 00:47:50,245
Not good.

732
00:47:52,247 --> 00:47:54,208
Listen, I've got to tell you something.

733
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:56,418
What?

734
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,921
Well, Nola and I...

735
00:47:58,962 --> 00:48:00,756
...broke up.

736
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:03,008
No!
- Yeah.

737
00:48:03,091 --> 00:48:05,385
Or, I should say, I called it off.

738
00:48:07,262 --> 00:48:09,056
I thought you were gonna get married.

739
00:48:09,139 --> 00:48:11,266
Yeah, well,
it's rather embarrassing to say

740
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:13,936
but I think Mother rather
poisoned the well on that one.

741
00:48:14,019 --> 00:48:17,147
Not that I have any intention
in marrying Olivia sodding Allred,

742
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:18,857
who's her main candidate.

743
00:48:19,233 --> 00:48:20,776
God, no.

744
00:48:21,902 --> 00:48:24,696
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

745
00:48:25,697 --> 00:48:28,200
I suppose the whole truth,
nothing but the truth,

746
00:48:28,283 --> 00:48:30,661
so help me God,
part of the situation is, is that...

747
00:48:31,662 --> 00:48:33,664
...I've met someone else.

748
00:48:33,747 --> 00:48:35,749
No!
- Yeah.

749
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:40,087
I met someone and I fell in love,
and I just knew right away.

750
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:43,507
Although the fact that my mother
is in seventh heaven about her,

751
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:46,844
I keep trying to tell myself
isn't a factor, but...

752
00:48:47,928 --> 00:48:49,930
You know what I mean.

753
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:11,368
The number you are calling
is not available.

754
00:49:13,078 --> 00:49:15,706
The number you are calling
is not available.

755
00:49:32,055 --> 00:49:33,098
Excuse me.

756
00:49:33,182 --> 00:49:35,642
Are you looking for Miss Rice?
- Yes.

757
00:49:35,726 --> 00:49:39,480
She's gone. Saw her yesterday.
She's given up the apartment.

758
00:49:42,149 --> 00:49:45,027
Did she say where?
- Not to me.

759
00:49:46,361 --> 00:49:48,822
Thanks.
- That's all right.

760
00:49:56,038 --> 00:49:58,707
What are you thinking about?
- Nothing.

761
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:01,585
Just business.

762
00:50:05,923 --> 00:50:08,717
You know it's been over a week
since we made love.

763
00:50:08,759 --> 00:50:11,261
Oh, Chloe, I'm beat.

764
00:50:12,763 --> 00:50:15,474
Am I being rejected?
- Of course not.

765
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:18,560
OK, I can take a hint.

766
00:50:22,815 --> 00:50:27,277
Meanwhile, I don't know what's wrong.
All my cousins get pregnant so easily.

767
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:28,737
Look...

768
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:31,156
...it'll happen.

769
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,659
I'm just really tired.

770
00:50:34,326 --> 00:50:36,078
Kiss.

771
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:42,584
Sweet dreams.

772
00:50:47,881 --> 00:50:50,801
I now pronounce you man and wife.

773
00:50:50,884 --> 00:50:53,011
You may kiss the bride.

774
00:51:03,313 --> 00:51:07,151
Just in time.
I'm almost starting to show.

775
00:51:10,154 --> 00:51:10,237
Well, you have
to see a fertility doctor.

776
00:51:10,237 --> 00:51:12,156
Well, you have
to see a fertility doctor.

777
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:13,448
I know.

778
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:16,785
We've tried everything.
- What about this?

779
00:51:16,827 --> 00:51:19,872
His brushstrokes are really intense,
aren't they?

780
00:51:19,955 --> 00:51:21,915
Yeah, I don't like it.
- No.

781
00:51:21,999 --> 00:51:25,460
Would you ever consider adopting?
- No, absolutely not.

782
00:51:25,502 --> 00:51:27,504
I want my own children.

783
00:51:28,046 --> 00:51:29,381
This one?

784
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:31,758
Sort of...

785
00:51:31,842 --> 00:51:34,303
Did I tell you Victoria Phyfe
is pregnant?

786
00:51:34,344 --> 00:51:35,554
Really?

787
00:51:35,637 --> 00:51:37,514
She's so happy.
- Whoa.

788
00:51:37,598 --> 00:51:39,600
Her and her husband
just found each other.

789
00:51:39,683 --> 00:51:42,644
All their neuroses
intertwine so perfectly,

790
00:51:42,728 --> 00:51:44,730
and itjust works like a charm.

791
00:51:44,813 --> 00:51:49,026
After all their unhappy relationships,
they met during a traffic accident.

792
00:51:49,234 --> 00:51:51,862
God...
- I know, it's great.

793
00:51:52,654 --> 00:51:54,948
Well, our lawyers
are going over it as we speak.

794
00:51:55,657 --> 00:51:58,577
You'll have a daft by Friday. I promise.

795
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,746
If I have to work all night.

796
00:52:00,829 --> 00:52:01,788
OK.

797
00:52:01,872 --> 00:52:03,999
Thank you. Thanks.

798
00:52:16,553 --> 00:52:18,764
Samantha,
can I have two aspirin, please?

799
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:27,898
Thanks.

800
00:52:29,691 --> 00:52:31,485
Are you OK, sir?

801
00:52:33,904 --> 00:52:37,366
Tell me, Samantha,
do you ever feel claustrophobic in here?

802
00:52:38,575 --> 00:52:41,078
No, not really.

803
00:52:44,665 --> 00:52:45,666
Oh, Christ!

804
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:47,709
I've got to meet my wife
at the Tate Modern.

805
00:52:47,793 --> 00:52:49,837
There's a new painter
she wants to show me.

806
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,172
If they call back, Samantha,
tell them Friday.

807
00:52:52,256 --> 00:52:53,799
Not before.

808
00:52:53,882 --> 00:52:55,634
Good night.

809
00:53:47,853 --> 00:53:50,856
Chris.
- Oh, I was looking for you.

810
00:53:50,939 --> 00:53:52,774
Hi, Carol.
- Hi, Chris.

811
00:53:52,816 --> 00:53:54,276
How are you, darling?
- Good.

812
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:56,612
They've got the most
amazing new artists here.

813
00:53:56,695 --> 00:53:57,696
Yeah?

814
00:53:57,779 --> 00:53:59,531
I want you to see
this woman from St. Ives.

815
00:53:59,615 --> 00:54:01,492
Oh, yes.
- Look, where are you going to be?

816
00:54:01,575 --> 00:54:02,576
Why?

817
00:54:02,659 --> 00:54:05,537
I have to make a phone call,
and I can't get any reception down here.

818
00:54:05,621 --> 00:54:08,290
Well, we'll be over there.
But hurry, 'cause they're closing soon.

819
00:54:08,373 --> 00:54:09,374
I'm coming.

820
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:11,001
OK.
- OK.

821
00:55:10,894 --> 00:55:12,312
Hello.

822
00:55:13,856 --> 00:55:15,524
What a surprise.

823
00:55:15,607 --> 00:55:16,942
I...

824
00:55:17,025 --> 00:55:20,779
I moved back into town.
- I didn't know you'd left town.

825
00:55:20,863 --> 00:55:24,533
Yeah, I was really upset
about everything that happened,

826
00:55:24,616 --> 00:55:27,202
so I just went back to America
to look for a job.

827
00:55:27,578 --> 00:55:31,540
I thought you hated that place?
- Anyplace but here.

828
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:34,793
I looked for you.

829
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,712
For what?

830
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,840
You're still so angry.

831
00:55:43,177 --> 00:55:44,887
Where are you living?

832
00:55:45,721 --> 00:55:48,223
In town. Why?

833
00:55:49,892 --> 00:55:51,185
You live alone?

834
00:55:51,226 --> 00:55:54,771
Why are you asking me these questions,
aren't you still married?

835
00:55:56,231 --> 00:55:58,233
Can I meet you for a drink?

836
00:55:58,317 --> 00:56:00,194
Talk?

837
00:56:01,778 --> 00:56:04,615
Where can I reach you? Oome on.

838
00:56:04,698 --> 00:56:07,868
My goodness. Hello.
- Hi, darling.

839
00:56:07,951 --> 00:56:09,995
Look who I bumped into.

840
00:56:10,078 --> 00:56:12,247
Hi.
- Hi.

841
00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:14,875
How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

842
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:17,211
You look great.
- Thanks.

843
00:56:17,878 --> 00:56:19,963
How's Tom?
- He's fine.

844
00:56:20,047 --> 00:56:23,175
Really well.
- Yeah, I heard he got married.

845
00:56:23,258 --> 00:56:25,886
Yeah. They've got a baby.

846
00:56:25,969 --> 00:56:28,096
You know Tom, all settled down.

847
00:56:28,138 --> 00:56:30,766
OK, I think I've found it.
- Do you two know each other?

848
00:56:30,807 --> 00:56:33,143
This is my friend Oarol.
This is Nola.

849
00:56:33,227 --> 00:56:34,436
Hi.
- Hi.

850
00:56:35,062 --> 00:56:38,023
We've been looking everywhere
for this video installation.

851
00:56:38,106 --> 00:56:41,193
We can't find it at all.
Will you excuse us?

852
00:56:41,276 --> 00:56:43,612
I think it's
on the third floor, isn't it?

853
00:56:43,654 --> 00:56:46,448
Yeah. No, no, no.
I think it's back there.

854
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:47,908
Say your phone number.

855
00:56:47,991 --> 00:56:51,328
What's the point?
- Just say your phone number.

856
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:53,080
Chris...
- Please.

857
00:56:53,163 --> 00:56:55,207
Say your phone number.

858
00:56:59,336 --> 00:57:03,423
02079460996.

859
00:57:04,675 --> 00:57:06,385
I'll call you.

860
00:57:07,678 --> 00:57:08,637
Bye.

861
00:57:12,224 --> 00:57:14,226
I think he really knows
what he's doing.

862
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:16,228
Didn't you get
a good feeling about him?

863
00:57:16,311 --> 00:57:18,981
To me, fertility doctors
are a cut above witch doctors.

864
00:57:19,022 --> 00:57:21,150
Oh, yeah.
Well, he's not like that last one.

865
00:57:21,525 --> 00:57:22,526
It's OK, John.

866
00:57:22,609 --> 00:57:24,403
I feel like it's gonna happen this time.

867
00:57:24,486 --> 00:57:26,238
You go ahead, I've got a few meetings.

868
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:28,824
I'll drop you.
- No, it's OK. It's nearby. I'll walk.

869
00:57:28,907 --> 00:57:30,075
OK.
- See you at home.

870
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:31,118
Bye.

871
00:58:04,693 --> 00:58:06,737
You have a very charming flat.

872
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:09,615
The area's not as run-down
as you said it was.

873
00:58:11,783 --> 00:58:14,536
I was lucky to find it
on such short notice.

874
00:58:15,871 --> 00:58:17,331
I mean, it's not perfect.

875
00:58:17,372 --> 00:58:20,375
The building's been burglarized
a couple of times and the...

876
00:58:20,417 --> 00:58:22,544
...woman down the hall has mice, but...

877
00:58:23,378 --> 00:58:26,423
...you know, the lobby's decent.

878
00:58:27,049 --> 00:58:29,426
The key word is it's cheap.

879
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:32,346
What time is it?

880
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:34,515
Time for you to go.

881
00:58:36,099 --> 00:58:38,101
It's so hard to leave you.

882
00:58:42,397 --> 00:58:44,358
Beautiful woman.

883
00:58:49,571 --> 00:58:51,073
How'd you sleep?

884
00:58:52,241 --> 00:58:53,617
Good.

885
00:58:57,079 --> 00:58:59,456
God, did you see that stuff
on the news last night

886
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,542
about that earthquake in China?

887
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:05,128
Terrible.

888
00:59:07,256 --> 00:59:09,216
And there was this whole thing
about how they've discovered

889
00:59:09,258 --> 00:59:12,219
an entirely new planet.
- Yeah?

890
00:59:12,261 --> 00:59:13,720
Yeah.

891
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:29,444
I went looking for space to rent
for the new gallery yesterday.

892
00:59:29,528 --> 00:59:31,905
Papa's getting so into the idea.

893
00:59:32,156 --> 00:59:34,158
It should be good for you.

894
00:59:36,076 --> 00:59:38,495
I've got to go to work.
- Oh, really?

895
00:59:40,038 --> 00:59:42,791
I was kind of hoping we might,
you know...

896
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:44,877
...before you went to work.

897
00:59:45,419 --> 00:59:48,005
It's my time of the month,
and remember the doctor said

898
00:59:48,088 --> 00:59:51,550
we really should try and do it as often
as we possibly can in the morning.

899
00:59:53,427 --> 00:59:56,555
Darling, I'm gonna be late.
- Come on, it'll be fun.

900
00:59:56,972 --> 00:59:59,266
Wait, I've got
to take my temperature first.

901
01:00:12,112 --> 01:00:14,615
So, you wanna meet
the same time next week?

902
01:00:14,656 --> 01:00:16,116
Let me come up.

903
01:00:16,158 --> 01:00:19,036
We just spent an hour at the hotel.
Don't tell me that you...

904
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:21,497
I'm sorry. I can't help it.
You drive me crazy.
