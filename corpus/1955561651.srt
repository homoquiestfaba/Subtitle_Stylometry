7
00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:24,843

[Chuckles]

12
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:36,761
I don't even know what I did.

13
00:00:37,034 --> 00:00:39,534
Can you hear me, though?
I-I... I'm having trouble hearing you.

14
00:00:39,744 --> 00:00:41,338
<i>You got him.</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

18
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,463
Yeah, we got him last night. We did it.

19
00:00:48,643 --> 00:00:50,107
But man, please...

20
00:00:50,662 --> 00:00:52,103
Tell me we cut off the trunk.

21
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,025
He died in prison, last year.

22
00:00:58,314 --> 00:01:00,431
So we... we did it. It's done.

23
00:01:01,673 --> 00:01:03,337
It's done.

[Chuckles]

25
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,930
- What about your mother?
- <i>Mom?</i>

26
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:12,610
What do you think? She's all over
my wedding plans like a pit viper.

27
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:13,813
[Laughs]

28
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,545
Ah, don't go crazy, would you?

29
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,546
When she got on her wedding day with

30
00:01:17,646 --> 00:01:20,132
<i>the courthouse ceremony and the 9.99 ***.</i>

31
00:01:20,202 --> 00:01:22,202
And a stubborn jackass for a husband.

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,744
Yeah. Yeah, that too. Mm.

33
00:01:28,378 --> 00:01:29,456
Hey, Dad. You got a pen?

34
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,024
Uh, yeah. Yeah, what's up?

35
00:01:32,532 --> 00:01:34,235
Write this down.

36
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:36,813
June 14th,

37
00:01:37,211 --> 00:01:38,758
<i>2011.</i>

38
00:01:45,024 --> 00:01:47,321
- Raims.
- <i>That's the day. Okay?</i>

39
00:01:47,383 --> 00:01:49,141
- No, I told you...
- <i>I don't care.</i>

40
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:51,111
We never have to talk on this thing again.

41
00:01:51,385 --> 00:01:53,657
<i>We'll never mess with someone else's fate,</i>

42
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:56,094
<i>our own, or anyone's we loved but...</i>

43
00:01:56,313 --> 00:01:57,821
on that day,

44
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:00,126
you can't leave the house.

45
00:02:00,447 --> 00:02:03,634
<i>And you can't, God forbid, get into a car.</i>

46
00:02:03,828 --> 00:02:06,038
Because that is not the day... you die

47
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:08,356
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

48
00:02:08,943 --> 00:02:10,520
Tell me you'll do this.

49
00:02:12,253 --> 00:02:13,557
<i>Not for me,</i>

50
00:02:13,988 --> 00:02:15,464
not for you.

51
00:02:18,956 --> 00:02:22,627
I've never seen anyone miss someone
the way she misses you, Dad.

52
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:26,622
<i>You want to give Mom something back,
you give her this.</i>

53
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,489
<i>Tell me you got this.</i>

54
00:02:30,036 --> 00:02:32,440
Dad, tell me you got this.

00:02:32,464 --> 00:02:34,464
[Rumbling, electricity crackling]

56
00:02:36,347 --> 00:02:37,741
Dad?
