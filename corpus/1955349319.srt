00:07:53,243 --> 00:07:55,963
-Yeah, I look up, Malcom
McDowell is ahead of me

174
00:07:55,956 --> 00:07:57,236
getting coffee.

175
00:07:57,237 --> 00:07:59,197
Chuck Palahniuk and
Max Brooks are trading

176
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,489
notes for their talk that night.

177
00:08:01,492 --> 00:08:04,342
And George Romero is just
kicking it in the lobby,

178
00:08:04,344 --> 00:08:06,524
and I just look around, and
I'm like, I'm surrounded.

179
00:08:06,517 --> 00:08:08,777
There's so much
genius in this room.

180
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,239
It was very hard for
me to contain myself,

181
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,831
and not just run up to
everyone and be like --

182
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:13,713
oh my God, I love you.

183
00:08:13,714 --> 00:08:14,844
I'm such a fan!

184
00:08:14,835 --> 00:08:16,685
-If this seems a awkward
for people at home,

185
00:08:16,687 --> 00:08:18,757
it's because the people that
are interviewing me right now

186
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,889
have no idea what I've done.

187
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:20,990
So I'm feeling like --
I'm sitting here like,

188
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,691
what do I do.

189
00:08:21,692 --> 00:08:23,222
I have to like feed
them into this stuff.

190
00:08:23,223 --> 00:08:26,023
-Going to shows like this, and
you see the way people dress,

191
00:08:26,016 --> 00:08:27,556
and the way that
they get into it --

192
00:08:27,558 --> 00:08:30,088
and they express themselves,
and something that they like.

193
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,200
I've always -- as an outsider,
someone who's not really

194
00:08:32,202 --> 00:08:36,902
into the genre myself, I can
still appreciate the fact that

195
00:08:36,897 --> 00:08:38,927
they are enjoying it,
and enjoying themselves.

196
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:41,899
-These people had seen
everything, a lot of them,

197
00:08:41,902 --> 00:08:43,842
and they would probably --
I don't mean to be mean,

198
00:08:43,844 --> 00:08:45,754
but they'd probably be more
equipped to interview me than

199
00:08:45,746 --> 00:08:48,686
this stuff -- don't
even know [INAUDIBLE]

200
00:08:48,689 --> 00:08:51,459
-I'm telling you because
they are the best.

201
00:08:51,461 --> 00:08:55,561
Our film fans are absolutely
the best there is on the planet,

202
00:08:55,556 --> 00:08:56,256
OK?

203
00:08:56,256 --> 00:08:59,646
They buy all the tickets, they
buy the DVDs, the posters,

204
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,560
the T-shirts , the
pictures, the --

205
00:09:02,563 --> 00:09:05,373
whatever the hell and
the crap we come up with,

206
00:09:05,365 --> 00:09:08,575
because they're there supporting
us all the way down the line,

207
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:12,119
and without them I got nothing.

208
00:09:12,122 --> 00:09:13,882
[INAUDIBLE] you what's
your favorite line in this,

209
00:09:13,884 --> 00:09:16,134
and my mind's going, oh God
-- I don't know [INAUDIBLE],

210
00:09:16,126 --> 00:09:17,136
what's your favorite line?

211
00:09:17,137 --> 00:09:18,267
And then they would
tell it to me,

212
00:09:18,268 --> 00:09:19,458
and I would say, coincidence!

213
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:20,879
That was my favorite line too.

214
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:22,091
And I'd write it on the thing.

215
00:09:22,092 --> 00:09:23,772
-I don't talk to
the celebrities,

216
00:09:23,774 --> 00:09:26,664
only because I'm always scared
it's going to change the way I

217
00:09:26,657 --> 00:09:29,037
see the movies, or anything
I'm interested in them in.

218
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:31,319
I like to see them in
like every day life.

219
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,251
You know, you see like -- like
we saw like Boondock Saints

220
00:09:34,254 --> 00:09:36,804
just walking around
casually like last night,

221
00:09:36,797 --> 00:09:38,757
and Sid Haig just
walking around.

222
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,919
And like that alone
is awesome to me --

223
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:42,871
just to see them in real life
when they're not in a film.

224
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,353
So I usually don't
talk to them much.

225
00:09:44,354 --> 00:10:03,094
[SWING MUSIC]

226
00:10:03,093 --> 00:10:04,423
-I have mixed feelings
about autographs.

227
00:10:04,424 --> 00:10:07,314
I really love get, you know,
my picture taken with someone ,

228
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:11,817
and get, you know, my book, or
my poster, or my movie signed,

229
00:10:11,822 --> 00:10:16,052
but I'm also very poor
and don't want to pay $20,

230
00:10:16,046 --> 00:10:18,166
$20, $20, $20, down the line.

231
00:10:18,168 --> 00:10:19,208
-I don't do this for the money.

232
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:21,189
I have my school, I'm --
you know -- Independent.

233
00:10:21,191 --> 00:10:24,671
I come here because of hanging
out with Mosley or Sid Haig,

234
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,655
you know?

235
00:10:25,656 --> 00:10:27,646
How hard is it to
sit here and have

236
00:10:27,648 --> 00:10:29,628
people throw money at
you all day, you know?

237
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,099
If you complain about
that you're a moron.

238
00:10:33,103 --> 00:10:34,853
-Finished signing
an autograph here

239
00:10:34,845 --> 00:10:38,065
and there's a guy that comes to
the table over here who said,

240
00:10:38,068 --> 00:10:39,068
would you sign my dick?

241
00:10:42,232 --> 00:10:43,662
I said, no I wouldn't.

242
00:10:43,664 --> 00:10:47,474
Not even if you
washed it recently.

243
00:10:47,467 --> 00:10:50,427
Besides which, I'm not sure I
could fit my signature on it.

244
00:10:56,907 --> 00:11:00,037
-Lovecraft has kind of enjoyed
this resurgence in popularity.

245
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,460
People are taking an
appreciation of sort

246
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,022
of their -- the
literature aspect of it.

247
00:11:04,024 --> 00:11:06,584
In fact, in Portland
we have a bar,

248
00:11:06,576 --> 00:11:08,556
the whole theme of
which is Lovecraft.

249
00:11:08,558 --> 00:11:09,938
The guy's kind of
painted on the ceiling,

250
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,810
and painted on the floor, and
posters, and all kinds of crazy

251
00:11:12,813 --> 00:11:13,793
stuff on the wall.

252
00:11:13,794 --> 00:11:15,494
-Hello, I'm John Horrid.

253
00:11:15,485 --> 00:11:18,155
I'm the owner of the Lovecraft
bar in Portland, Oregon.

254
00:11:18,158 --> 00:11:20,478
The Lovecraft bar
is not a Gothic bar.

255
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,850
It's a horror-themed bar
embracing all horror culture.

256
00:11:23,854 --> 00:11:27,864
Be it literature,
music fashion or art.

257
00:11:27,858 --> 00:11:31,038
That way it's a broader
spectrum for everyone

258
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,141
who loves anything
dark or spooky

259
00:11:33,143 --> 00:11:34,893
that goes bump in the night.

260
00:11:34,885 --> 00:11:38,305
It's sort of like Tim
Burton designed a lounge,

261
00:11:38,308 --> 00:11:40,448
you know, it's goofy horror.

262
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,220
It's not so serious,
But it's definitely --

263
00:11:42,222 --> 00:11:43,552
we have children's
coffins on the walls.

264
00:11:43,553 --> 00:11:45,853
There's bones
everywhere, and chains,

265
00:11:45,846 --> 00:11:47,386
but it's also kind
of fun feeling.

266
00:11:47,387 --> 00:12:06,747
[MUSIC]

267
00:12:06,747 --> 00:12:11,287
JOHN HORRID: H.P. Lovecraft
is probably one of the biggest

268
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:14,211
names in horror, but has
never got credit for it.

269
00:12:14,214 --> 00:12:17,124
It's always Poe, and
Stephen King, and Anne Rice,

270
00:12:17,117 --> 00:12:18,227
and whatnot.

271
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:22,048
But Lovecraft's impact on the
world of horror is immense.

272
00:12:22,052 --> 00:12:25,292
They've inspired
Metallica, Iron Maiden,

273
00:12:25,285 --> 00:12:28,975
mentioned in "Ghostbusters"
"Hellboy" -- he's everywhere.

274
00:12:28,979 --> 00:12:32,439
He's dark, he's gloomy, he's a
total freak, and he's awesome.

275
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:34,282
I didn't want to be
specifically Lovecraft themed

276
00:12:34,284 --> 00:12:36,404
because there's so
much more to offer,

277
00:12:36,396 --> 00:12:38,846
and I'm a huge fan of
black-and-white horror movies

278
00:12:38,849 --> 00:12:40,229
honestly, so it's
just basically,

279
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,510
I wanted to capture
that sort of feel.

280
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:47,602
With the broader spectrum of
horror, it attracts all sorts.

281
00:12:47,597 --> 00:12:50,197
I love that we've attracted
authors, for example,

282
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,990
like young, punky,
splatter horror authors

283
00:12:52,993 --> 00:12:54,753
are hanging out here.

284
00:12:54,754 --> 00:12:56,334
Apparently the road
manager to Metallica

285
00:12:56,326 --> 00:12:57,756
has been hanging out here.

286
00:12:57,757 --> 00:13:01,147
One of my favorite nights
ever, we first opened --

287
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:02,451
you got your
sulking metal heads,

288
00:13:02,452 --> 00:13:03,902
and your gloom-and-doom
goths over here,

289
00:13:03,904 --> 00:13:06,554
and there's a girls
dressed all in white --

290
00:13:06,546 --> 00:13:09,086
she's bouncing around, and
I'm like, fuck, here we go,

291
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:11,139
there goes the end
of the bar, you know?

292
00:13:11,141 --> 00:13:13,311
But I'm not a dick, I
want to, like, be polite.

293
00:13:13,313 --> 00:13:14,863
She came up, she's
like, you're the owner?

294
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:15,415
And I was like,
yeah, I'm the owner.

295
00:13:15,415 --> 00:13:16,745
And she's like, I love your bar.

296
00:13:16,746 --> 00:13:18,986
And I'm like, thank
you, you know?

297
00:13:18,989 --> 00:13:20,659
She's like I'm gonna tell
all my friends about it,

298
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,360
and I'm like, cool.

299
00:13:21,361 --> 00:13:22,501
And she's like, I'm a librarian.

300
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:25,992
And I'm like, please tell all
your freaky library friends,

301
00:13:25,986 --> 00:13:27,316
'cause librarians are freaks yo.

302
00:13:27,317 --> 00:13:28,017
Bottom line.

303
00:13:28,018 --> 00:13:32,358
And we're slowly attracting
across the country

304
00:13:32,362 --> 00:13:34,202
a buzz with little
to no advertising.

305
00:13:34,204 --> 00:13:35,104
I don't Twitter.

306
00:13:35,095 --> 00:13:37,035
I fucking hate that shit.

307
00:13:37,037 --> 00:13:38,857
Word of mouth has
been strong enough

308
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,609
that horror fans
are coming to us.

309
00:13:41,611 --> 00:13:43,121
And ultimately my
goal is to get, like ,

310
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:46,313
Bruce Cambell or [INAUDIBLE]
in here, just to hang out.

311
00:13:46,306 --> 00:13:47,756
And they drink for
free, of course.

312
00:13:47,757 --> 00:13:52,717
So I was in a huge sort
of renovated furniture,

313
00:13:52,722 --> 00:13:54,672
recycled materials place.

314
00:13:54,674 --> 00:13:56,204
And I gave the
question, I was like,

315
00:13:56,196 --> 00:13:57,856
what do you have that's
uncomfortable for you

316
00:13:57,858 --> 00:13:58,928
guys here?

317
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:03,489
And they mentioned, their
1890s children's coffins,

318
00:14:03,493 --> 00:14:05,563
and I was like, oh
I got to see those.

319
00:14:05,555 --> 00:14:07,735
And they're mahogany, and they
came in the original packaging.

320
00:14:07,737 --> 00:14:09,477
I fell in love with them
the second I saw them.

321
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:11,749
And the price is right.

322
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:14,671
I can't say I've spent more on
sushi , but I've come close.

323
00:14:14,674 --> 00:14:16,424
And they had a matching pair.

324
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:19,736
And even the guys who delivered
didn't want to touch the boxes

325
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:21,119
-- they were so superstitious.

326
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:25,661
The Lovecraft Bar is an art
project always in motion.

327
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:28,395
Whenever I'm out, antique
stores or whatever, I always

328
00:14:28,398 --> 00:14:31,048
ask whoever is
working there, what's

329
00:14:31,051 --> 00:14:32,471
the most messed up
thing you have here?

330
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:34,612
What makes you uncomfortable?

331
00:14:34,614 --> 00:14:35,544
And then I usually guy it.

332
00:14:35,535 --> 00:14:39,925
Animal traps, old surgical
instruments, coffin handles,

333
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:44,330
weird taxidermy art, stuff like
that has always appealed to me.

334
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:45,684
LINNEA QUIGLEY:
Chainsaw Manicure.

335
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,710
It was actually pretty easy to
break into movies when I first

336
00:14:53,713 --> 00:14:55,483
started, because I
was at a young age.

337
00:14:55,475 --> 00:14:57,605
I actually looked a
lot younger than I was.

338
00:14:57,607 --> 00:15:04,417
I was 18 when I started, and I
looked probably, oh 15 or 16.

339
00:15:04,424 --> 00:15:08,394
So it was actually a pretty
easy step for me to get into it.

340
00:15:08,388 --> 00:15:11,598
And they were doing a lot
of the '80s horror films,

341
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:16,411
and I fit right in, at that
time, as being a victim.

342
00:15:16,406 --> 00:15:17,886
After "Return of
the Living Dead"

343
00:15:17,887 --> 00:15:20,387
and "Night of the
Demons," all of a sudden,

344
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:23,280
like People Magazine,
Entertainment Tonight,

345
00:15:23,283 --> 00:15:26,383
all these, you know, press
people started coming to me --

346
00:15:26,376 --> 00:15:27,966
Premiere Magazine.

347
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:31,408
And they start calling me, you
know, Queen of the Screams,

348
00:15:31,411 --> 00:15:33,611
which is like, I
love it, you know?

349
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:34,793
I like that title.

350
00:15:34,794 --> 00:15:35,684
I want it.

351
00:15:35,675 --> 00:15:39,245
And so I embraced it, where a
lot of the actresses back then

352
00:15:39,249 --> 00:15:42,299
-- like nudity
wasn't, you know, you

353
00:15:42,302 --> 00:15:44,962
just didn't do nudity back then.

354
00:15:44,955 --> 00:15:46,735
I was doing some nudity.

355
00:15:46,736 --> 00:15:49,446
You didn't do,
like, these B-films

356
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,709
that would hurt your career.

357
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:54,510
And I just, like I said,
embraced it instead of just

358
00:15:54,514 --> 00:15:57,934
shrugged it off, and said, I'm
not doing one of those films.

359
00:15:57,927 --> 00:16:01,377
It's blood, breasts,
and they did say bimbos,

360
00:16:01,381 --> 00:16:03,141
but it's not bimbos anymore.

361
00:16:03,143 --> 00:16:04,623
It's more strong women.

362
00:16:04,624 --> 00:16:06,964
But you've got to
have some blood,

363
00:16:06,956 --> 00:16:08,376
and you've got to
have some breasts,

364
00:16:08,378 --> 00:16:10,928
I think, to have a
good horror film.

365
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:14,210
I mean, I make the
perfect scream queen,

366
00:16:14,214 --> 00:16:18,774
it's shown at theaters --
it's been shown at theaters.

367
00:16:18,768 --> 00:16:21,928
I've done like 100
films, I love horror.

368
00:16:21,931 --> 00:16:24,951
I think you have
to love horror too.

369
00:16:24,954 --> 00:16:27,744
And you have to
scream very well.

370
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:32,467
This is a crazy fan is
coming after you: Ahhh!

371
00:16:44,224 --> 00:16:46,014
-There's a lot of really
good horror bands out there,

372
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,845
but I think the one that did
-- has the greatest influence

373
00:16:48,848 --> 00:16:51,268
over things would
be White Zombie.

374
00:16:51,271 --> 00:16:52,681
They're one of the
few that started off

375
00:16:52,682 --> 00:16:54,852
doing horror for the very start.

376
00:16:54,854 --> 00:16:57,524
And even the name, White
Zombie comes from the movie

377
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,217
White Zombie, which
some people think

378
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,819
is the first zombie
movie ever made.

379
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:07,561
-I joined White Zombie be back
in 1980 -- like late '85/86.

380
00:17:07,557 --> 00:17:09,867
Joining a band before
White Zombie with Shauna.

381
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:10,909
It was a band called LIFE.

382
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,150
And so that's how I met her.

383
00:17:13,153 --> 00:17:15,333
We did a few shows,
band broke up.

384
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,165
They got -- she was going
out with Rob Zombie,

385
00:17:18,168 --> 00:17:22,418
and basically they called me
up right after they had this

386
00:17:22,422 --> 00:17:24,292
drummer Peter do a couple songs.

387
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:28,924
I jumped on board and we
started, just immediately

388
00:17:28,918 --> 00:17:33,478
writing and recording,
and touring.

389
00:17:33,483 --> 00:17:34,823
We just picked up right away.

390
00:17:34,824 --> 00:17:39,344
Rob had that band named before
the band was even formed.

391
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:42,019
So White Zombie already
existed before the band

392
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:43,411
was even in existence.

393
00:17:43,413 --> 00:17:47,213
He just said, I want a band to
be called White Zombie one day,

394
00:17:47,207 --> 00:17:49,257
and then he put the band
together with Shauna.

395
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:52,989
Rob and I both had that
background of horror movies.

396
00:17:52,992 --> 00:17:56,022
He brought that
flavor into the band,

397
00:17:56,015 --> 00:17:58,055
and I was all about
that because, you know,

398
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:01,107
I came from the
horror stuff myself.

399
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:03,461
And I was all into Iron Maiden
with the Eddie monster thing,

400
00:18:03,463 --> 00:18:04,793
so I thought that was
perfect, you know,

401
00:18:04,794 --> 00:18:06,484
for something I wanted to do.

402
00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:07,856
You know?

403
00:18:07,857 --> 00:18:09,827
IVAN DE PRUME: Toxic Zombie,
man, these guys are awesome.

404
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:12,069
Bryan Bennett worked
with me on "Metalopolis."

405
00:18:12,071 --> 00:18:14,811
That's when I first -- when
he first joined Toxic Zombie,

406
00:18:14,814 --> 00:18:20,164
and they did a Halloween show
where they had me come up,

407
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,210
play "Thunder Kiss" with them.

408
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:23,411
We hung out and
talked about doing

409
00:18:23,413 --> 00:18:26,073
the some songs
here in the studio.

410
00:18:26,065 --> 00:18:40,375
[MUSIC]

411
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,980
-If you were to describe
what kind of music we play,

412
00:18:43,983 --> 00:18:47,263
if you would imagine that --
and you have to have a good

413
00:18:47,257 --> 00:18:51,057
imagination for this --
imagine if Kiss, Motley Crew,

414
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,720
and the Misfits had a gang
bang with Joan Jett, Lita Ford,

415
00:18:54,724 --> 00:18:57,934
and Wendy O. Williams, we would
be their bastard children.

416
00:18:57,927 --> 00:19:00,097
It didn't actually start
out as a zombie band,

417
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:02,019
even though we were called
Toxic Zombie at first.

418
00:19:02,021 --> 00:19:06,141
We actually started out more
as just a regular hard rock

419
00:19:06,135 --> 00:19:07,165
band with a little influence.

420
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:09,087
And then we had the dancing
girls, of course and stuff.

421
00:19:09,088 --> 00:19:10,968
But it didn't actually
start out as a zombie band

422
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,270
until probably a couple months
into doing our first shows.

423
00:19:14,274 --> 00:19:15,874
We just kind of embraced
it a little bit more.

424
00:19:15,865 --> 00:19:17,165
And I actually
think Sam, actually,

425
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:20,007
is the one who kind of embraced
the concept a little bit more.

426
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:23,079
SAM: Yeah, I was the first
one to put on the make up,

427
00:19:23,082 --> 00:19:24,912
and I looked rather
weird without everybody

428
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,024
else putting the make up on.

429
00:19:27,016 --> 00:19:29,166
-It's a very unconventional
type of thing.

430
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,068
There is a zombie culture,
there's a horror culture,

431
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:35,191
but there are -- in Portland
and I'm sure they're out there,

432
00:19:35,185 --> 00:19:36,865
but I'm not aware
of them, there's not

433
00:19:36,866 --> 00:19:38,666
too many horror bands.

434
00:19:38,668 --> 00:19:39,948
-We've played a
lot of gigs with --

435
00:19:39,949 --> 00:19:42,459
we've played with the
Misfits, Wednesday 13,

436
00:19:42,462 --> 00:19:44,352
Gunfire 76, is also connected.

437
00:19:44,354 --> 00:19:47,744
And we opened up for Creature
Feature was one of our first,

438
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:49,307
bigger shows that
we played with,

439
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:51,469
which kind of led to all
those other shows, Wednesday

440
00:19:51,471 --> 00:19:54,331
13 and the Misfits and what not.

441
00:19:54,334 --> 00:19:59,454
And we also played a local event
called Zombie Prom a few years

442
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:03,629
ago, and having 600
people scream out

443
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:06,233
"we will eat your
brains" with us

444
00:20:06,226 --> 00:20:08,426
was probably one
of the best moments

445
00:20:08,428 --> 00:20:13,638
ever to have at a show, you now?

446
00:20:13,643 --> 00:20:16,293
-Especially when they're
all dressed like zombies.

447
00:20:16,286 --> 00:20:18,566
Got a mass of zombies
in front of us chanting,

448
00:20:18,568 --> 00:20:19,688
"we will eat your brains."

449
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:20,959
Like, how can it be better?

450
00:20:27,757 --> 00:20:31,567
MAN 1: We're here
at Zombie Prom 2011.

451
00:20:31,571 --> 00:20:33,231
-We are in fabulous
Portland, where

452
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,732
there is nothing but
zombie awesomeness.

453
00:20:35,725 --> 00:20:46,125
[MUSIC]

454
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,695
HEATHER ERICKSON:
[INAUDIBLE] is Zombie Prom 4.

455
00:20:47,697 --> 00:20:50,157
My inspiration for
doing it, really

456
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:55,459
was, there's not enough events
downtown that were inexpensive,

457
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:56,655
fun to go to.

458
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:59,386
My idea for this was
someone could roll around

459
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:01,349
in the dirt, the mud, come
in, you know, with clothes

460
00:21:01,351 --> 00:21:04,961
from Goodwill, something like
that, and come to a prom.

461
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:12,724
[MUSIC]

462
00:21:12,722 --> 00:21:13,422
-My name is Blake.

463
00:21:13,423 --> 00:21:15,553
This is -- who the hell are you?

464
00:21:15,545 --> 00:21:16,245
-Janellle.

465
00:21:16,245 --> 00:21:16,945
Nice to meet you.

466
00:21:16,946 --> 00:21:17,706
-Oh, OK.

467
00:21:17,707 --> 00:21:18,407
I found her.

468
00:21:18,408 --> 00:21:19,178
She's a random zombie.

469
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:19,948
We like her though.

470
00:21:19,949 --> 00:21:22,479
JANELLE: My impression
is really fun.

471
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:27,492
Just a group of people dressing
up and going to a dance.

472
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:30,387
I don't care for horror movies,
but I'm here to have fun,

473
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,410
so this seemed like a
really fun thing to do

474
00:21:32,412 --> 00:21:34,852
and I'm all dressed up.

476
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,390
MAN 2: This is my
first big zombie event.

477
00:21:43,393 --> 00:21:45,163
The first I've actually
gotten dressed up

478
00:21:45,164 --> 00:21:48,044
to show up outside of
Halloween, other than being

479
00:21:48,037 --> 00:21:50,887
cast for a play or a movie.

480
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,220
Actually I set the
Guinness World Record

481
00:21:52,221 --> 00:21:54,531
for fastest straitjacket
escape in 2007

482
00:21:54,534 --> 00:21:56,244
when I was stationed
over in Japan,

483
00:21:56,235 --> 00:21:57,995
and it works great as a costume.

484
00:21:57,997 --> 00:22:00,687
everyone seems to
recognize it wherever I go.

485
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,700
It's kind have been a
staple for Halloween,

486
00:22:02,702 --> 00:22:04,172
any other type of
dress up event,

487
00:22:04,173 --> 00:22:07,973
or anything for fancy dress.

488
00:22:07,967 --> 00:22:11,957
-We are foreign exchange
students at this zombie prom.

489
00:22:11,961 --> 00:22:14,951
WOMAN 1: This is our 4th
year, and I was just looking

490
00:22:14,954 --> 00:22:16,674
for something
different to do so --

491
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:19,096
I always wondered if
the vampires did exist,

492
00:22:19,098 --> 00:22:22,518
what would they do when
everybody turned into zombies.

493
00:22:22,522 --> 00:22:23,982
What are they gonna eat?

494
00:22:23,983 --> 00:22:25,663
-Maybe they would just
come out and have some fun.

495
00:22:25,655 --> 00:22:26,195
-Yeah.

496
00:22:26,195 --> 00:22:28,435
HEATHER ERICKSON: The first year
we didn't have a theme with it,

497
00:22:28,438 --> 00:22:32,918
it was just Zombie Prom 1,
and we expected about 200-300

498
00:22:32,922 --> 00:22:35,332
people and ended
up with almost 700.

499
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:36,544
So we weren't
expecting that at all.

500
00:22:36,536 --> 00:22:38,006
So we had to move to
move to a bigger venue,

501
00:22:38,007 --> 00:22:39,557
and we've been at the
Bosanova ever since.

502
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:43,129
The first one we had here
was Under the Dead Sea.

503
00:22:43,132 --> 00:22:46,052
And then we had a Pretty
in Pieces last year,

504
00:22:46,045 --> 00:22:48,565
and then this year
is Tiki Terror.

505

name is Audrey Angel.

00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:52,709
I'm one of the merch girls this
year, selling the art up there.

507
00:22:52,712 --> 00:22:56,372
I do colored pencil work
that's pretty photo realistic,

508
00:22:56,365 --> 00:22:59,205
but I do it of a fantasy nature,
so I turn people into zombies,

509
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:00,698
or mermaids.

510
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,370
You know, I've done lots of
zombie events in the past.

511
00:23:03,372 --> 00:23:06,762
I did Zombie Prom here a couple
years ago as a merch girl.

512
00:23:06,756 --> 00:23:09,186
I do the Zombie
Walks every year.

513
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:13,498
I had a random zombie wedding
with a girl a few years back.

514
00:23:13,503 --> 00:23:15,593
I like making horror
things, I don't --

515
00:23:15,585 --> 00:23:18,005
I don't really like being --
I don't like watching horror

516
00:23:18,007 --> 00:23:21,957
movies, but as soon you give me
the project of making something

517
00:23:21,961 --> 00:23:25,161
explode, or into a gory
mess, I live for that.

518
00:23:25,164 --> 00:23:26,664
-There are little
ones everywhere.

519
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:29,236
We're one of the biggest in
this side of the United States.

520
00:23:29,238 --> 00:23:32,328
There are a lot of individual
parties, children's parties,

521
00:23:32,331 --> 00:23:35,391
I get asked all the time how
to do a zombie kid's party.

522
00:23:35,394 --> 00:23:36,324
Things like that.

523
00:23:42,872 --> 00:23:49,442
-My name is Robyn Winn
and this is Sofia.

524
00:23:49,439 --> 00:23:53,169
I would consider myself
a hardcore horror fan.

525
00:23:53,172 --> 00:23:57,172
It's not all I live and breath,
but I am a really big fan,

526
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:59,096
and I like them a
lot, which is weird

527
00:23:59,098 --> 00:24:00,928
'cause when I was little I
was kind of scared. of them.

528
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:03,020
-I wasn't allowed to watch a
lot of horror movies growing up.

529
00:24:03,022 --> 00:24:05,192
My parents took the R
rating very seriously,

530
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,864
so I was restricted from
watching a lot of these films.

531
00:24:07,857 --> 00:24:15,177
-My family's really --
anything scary, horror, blood,

532
00:24:15,184 --> 00:24:16,874
it's, you know,
the devil's work.

533
00:24:16,866 --> 00:24:23,416
-My mother-in-law, Joe's mom,
she's not very supportive of us

534
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:25,502
like letting her
watch horror stuff.

535
00:24:25,495 --> 00:24:27,425
There's nothing that's going
to warp her, and like I said,

536
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:30,616
there's nothing overly
sexual or super, super gory,

537
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,180
and not a lot of
realistic violence.

538
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:35,052
-My son's 11 and
he's been watching

539
00:24:35,054 --> 00:24:36,224
horror movies since he was four.

540
00:24:36,215 --> 00:24:40,085
And it's nothing -- I
mean, I I'm not concerned.

541
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:43,479
He doesn't talk about it to
a point where it scares me.

542
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,182
He doesn't do anything
that would scare me.

543
00:24:46,175 --> 00:24:50,485
-The first horror movie I
ever saw was "Ghost Ship,"

544
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,279
and I was four.

545
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:55,131
I was a smiling the
entire way through it.

546
00:24:55,134 --> 00:24:56,694
I just loved it.

547
00:24:56,686 --> 00:24:58,796
-The first movie I
ever saw in the theater

548
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:01,708
was "Beauty and the
Beast," the Disney.

549
00:25:01,711 --> 00:25:03,941
And I actually was so,
I was really young,

550
00:25:03,943 --> 00:25:06,693
and I was so frightened of
the beast on the big screen

551
00:25:06,686 --> 00:25:09,916
when he was all angry, that I
actually ran out of the theater

552
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,539
and had to like stay out
in the lobby and calm down.

553
00:25:12,542 --> 00:25:16,592
-What I know is every
Disney movie has

554
00:25:16,586 --> 00:25:20,636
a really bad scary guy in it,
and psychologists will tell you

555
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,370
that kids gravitate towards
that part of the movie

556
00:25:24,373 --> 00:25:27,173
because they get to practice
handling their fear.

557
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:28,856
-It was "King
Kong" or "Godzilla"

558
00:25:28,858 --> 00:25:31,868
or whatever, and it was really
funny because my mother would

559
00:25:31,871 --> 00:25:33,501
watch them with me for
the first couple of years,

560
00:25:33,502 --> 00:25:36,132
to make sure they didn't
tweak me out for some reason.

561
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:37,685
-My name is Sally
Skelding, and I'm

562
00:25:37,687 --> 00:25:39,287
an early childhood specialists.

563
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,468
And throughout my career
in early childhood,

564
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:44,390
I've been very interested
in the impact of violence

565
00:25:44,393 --> 00:25:47,343
on television and movies,
and how that influences

566
00:25:47,336 --> 00:25:49,536
the behavior of young children.

567
00:25:49,538 --> 00:25:53,078
-With Kiara we watch like
Addams Family movies,

568
00:25:53,082 --> 00:25:55,922
and Army of Darkness,
'cause it's super campy.

569
00:25:55,915 --> 00:25:58,125
Nothing too gory,
nothing sexual.

570
00:25:58,127 --> 00:26:00,247
-Being a parent, I have
a six old daughter,

571
00:26:00,249 --> 00:26:02,609
so my horror community
has veered back

572
00:26:02,612 --> 00:26:06,512
towards the Munsters,
and the Addams

573
00:26:06,505 --> 00:26:08,765
Family, and Universal Monsters.

574
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,758
-In the very early
years they do not

575
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,150
think the way that we think.

576
00:26:12,151 --> 00:26:15,111
They do not construct a
reality the way that we do,

577
00:26:15,114 --> 00:26:17,864
and a lot of people
simply cannot accept that.

578
00:26:17,857 --> 00:26:19,827
They'll say, oh my
child understands this,

579
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:21,179
I explained that to them.

580
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,750
And the child will sit
there and go, oh yes,

581
00:26:22,752 --> 00:26:24,992
I know this is pretend,
but they really

582
00:26:24,994 --> 00:26:28,324
don't because until they're
about eight or nine years old

583
00:26:28,317 --> 00:26:30,977
they do not even begin to
think the way that we do.

584
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,700
JOE: Hey, so when we
watch horror movies,

585
00:26:32,702 --> 00:26:34,422
you know it's not real, huh?

586
00:26:34,423 --> 00:26:36,173
-I know it's just fake.

587
00:26:36,165 --> 00:26:38,125
-Is it costumes?

588
00:26:38,127 --> 00:26:39,427
Some times they
use puppets, right?

589
00:26:39,428 --> 00:26:41,218
Remember you were asking
about Army of Darkness

590
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,620
and if the skeletons
were on strings.

591
00:26:43,623 --> 00:26:47,283
And I told you they
were puppets, remember?

592
00:26:47,276 --> 00:26:49,586
-That's like "Pee
Wee's Play House."

593
00:26:49,588 --> 00:26:52,248
-She does understand that
it's costumes and props.

594
00:26:52,251 --> 00:26:54,381
-A very young children,
like a preschool child,

595
00:26:54,383 --> 00:26:57,133
will go to see one of
these horrible movies,

596
00:26:57,126 --> 00:26:59,836
and they think this is real.

597
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:01,809
Even though they
bought the ticket,

598
00:27:01,811 --> 00:27:03,641
they've gone in
with their parents,

599
00:27:03,643 --> 00:27:05,413
everybody says this is pretend.

600
00:27:05,414 --> 00:27:07,634
What they see on
the screen is real

601
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,076
because it resembles
their reality.

602
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,529
-My first exposure
happened at age six,

603
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:16,852
and this was back
in the 1970s when

604
00:27:16,846 --> 00:27:19,746
PG movies could get
away with a lot more.

605
00:27:19,749 --> 00:27:24,569
So I saw full-frontal naked
Brooke Adams, and Donald

606
00:27:24,573 --> 00:27:27,603
Sutherland smashing in the
head of his alien doppelgangers

607
00:27:27,596 --> 00:27:30,916
here with a shovel, and kinda
going, what am I looking at?

608
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,630
I felt like I'd
been shown much more

609
00:27:32,631 --> 00:27:34,261
than I was supposed to see.

610
00:27:34,263 --> 00:27:37,583
-Children have to see it
over, and over, and over,

611
00:27:37,576 --> 00:27:41,326
and over again in order to
try to make sense out of it.

612
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:45,030
So they see it, it
comes into their mind,

613
00:27:45,034 --> 00:27:47,954
they have to make an adaptation
between what they've seen

614
00:27:47,947 --> 00:27:49,697
and their reality.

615
00:27:49,699 --> 00:27:52,819
If they're young, up to like
seven or eight years of age,

616
00:27:52,822 --> 00:27:55,362
that can be almost impossible
sometimes for them.

617
00:27:55,364 --> 00:27:57,264
-Just as long as you talk
to your kids about it,

618
00:27:57,256 --> 00:27:58,956
and you're like, it's not real.

619
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:01,128
But you can't really keep
them from having nightmares,

620
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:04,590
but I mean, you know, watching
"Poltergeist" at eight

621
00:28:04,593 --> 00:28:05,493
didn't hurt me.

622
00:28:05,494 --> 00:28:07,254
-Part of the problem
is that, in this age,

623
00:28:07,246 --> 00:28:11,626
we think the child is
anything from zero to 18,

624
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:14,210
and so what we would allow our
18-year-old child to watch,

625
00:28:14,213 --> 00:28:15,473
then we go ahead
and let our baby

626
00:28:15,474 --> 00:28:16,464
go to the movies with this.

627
00:28:16,455 --> 00:28:19,025
Or we take our three-year-old
or our four-year-old.

628
00:28:19,028 --> 00:28:21,348
We no longer make those
very clear distinctions

629
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,570
about what is appropriate
for children who

630
00:28:23,572 --> 00:28:26,582
are in the early childhood
years and early primary years,

631
00:28:26,575 --> 00:28:28,625
and what would be
appropriate for an adult

632
00:28:28,627 --> 00:28:30,197
or for an older teenager.

633
00:28:30,199 --> 00:28:34,169
-As a mother, I don't have a
problem with horror movies.

634
00:28:34,173 --> 00:28:36,093
We don't, like we don't
shy away from her right

635
00:28:36,085 --> 00:28:39,555
now with her around 'cause she's
too little to really notice,

636
00:28:39,558 --> 00:28:42,868
but I do have a stepson
and he is seven.

637
00:28:42,872 --> 00:28:45,302
He will not watch
anything with blood in it.

638
00:28:45,304 --> 00:28:49,284
He's like, no I won't
watch that, it's scary,

639
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:51,098
and if it's got blood
in it I won't watch it.

640
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,450
And I mean it's
really like up to him.

641
00:28:52,451 --> 00:28:56,911
-You will find absolutely no
child guidance book, no book

642
00:28:56,906 --> 00:29:01,846
on child development, no
expert on early childhood that

643
00:29:01,851 --> 00:29:03,711
will say, oh yes, the
thing you need to do

644
00:29:03,712 --> 00:29:06,602
is to fill your child's
head with horror.

645
00:29:06,595 --> 00:29:09,565
-I think that horror
movies themselves

646
00:29:09,568 --> 00:29:12,048
don't affect anybody.

647
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:15,921
I think it's how -- I think
it's the person that decides how

648
00:29:15,915 --> 00:29:17,795
the movie's going
to affect them.

649
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,867
Because I do work with children,
and there are children who do

650
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:23,670
watch horror movies,
and they come to school

651
00:29:23,672 --> 00:29:26,912
and they are perfectly behaved,
and they don't perseverate

652
00:29:26,906 --> 00:29:29,666
on the violence, or the horror.

653
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:32,668
And then I have other kids who
come and that's all they do,

654
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:34,871
is to perseverate on the
violence and the horror.

655
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:40,054
-Bottom line is, the kids take
everything off of the parents'

656
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:43,219
vibration about it, so if
the parents think it's OK

657
00:29:43,222 --> 00:29:46,332
and it's just another
movie, the the kids grow up

658
00:29:46,325 --> 00:29:48,465
thinking it's OK and
its just another movie.

659
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:51,837
-I kinda grew up as a gentle
creature in a somewhat hostile

660
00:29:51,841 --> 00:29:55,871
environment, and I do
believe that horror films

661
00:29:55,865 --> 00:29:57,865
helped me process
my environment.

662
00:29:57,867 --> 00:30:02,207
-I don't think anybody ever
landed on a therapist's couch

663
00:30:02,211 --> 00:30:05,391
and said, I'm hear because
I watched horror films.

664
00:30:05,394 --> 00:30:07,924
-I just think that this
horror stuff, if it goes in,

665
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:09,747
it's going to come out and
we don't know how it's going

666
00:30:09,748 --> 00:30:11,958
to come out, and we do
know from the research

667
00:30:11,961 --> 00:30:17,761
that it does indeed create some
insensitivity to other people's

668
00:30:17,756 --> 00:30:23,176
feelings of fear, or
terror, or if we see people

669
00:30:23,182 --> 00:30:26,202
on the street that

empathy that apparently,

we used to have.

of like old hat.

yeah, OK, whatever.

and raped, and
killed, and beheaded,

685
00:30:54,613 --> 00:30:57,213
and dumped by the side of
the road every single day.

686

None of this is
from the imagination

687
00:30:59,728 --> 00:31:01,438

-I Had seen the original
"Texas Chainsaw Massacre."

691
00:31:12,361 --> 00:31:17,191
It really freaked me out, so
what I ended up doing was --

692
00:31:17,186 --> 00:31:22,806
my best thinking was, if I
see it about a dozen times

693
00:31:22,811 --> 00:31:25,511
it's going to become so familiar
that it won't freak me out

694
00:31:25,514 --> 00:31:30,044
anymore, and really all that
happened was it just drove that

695
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:34,099
wedge deeper and deeper
each time I saw that movie.

696
00:31:34,103 --> 00:31:35,973
And I penned about a
five minute scenario

697
00:31:35,965 --> 00:31:39,315
about a woman who goes
to a beauty parlor,

698
00:31:39,318 --> 00:31:43,648
gets her hair done, wants to get
a manicure, Leather Face comes

699
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:46,722
out with a chain saw and
gives her the manicure.

700
00:31:46,715 --> 00:31:48,445
And she comes out of
the beauty parlor,

701
00:31:48,447 --> 00:31:52,337
and I'm her husband waiting in
a pickup truck, and she comes

702
00:31:52,341 --> 00:31:55,591
and she goes, look honey, I
got the best manicure ever.

703
00:31:55,594 --> 00:31:58,664
And I had a friend
from high school

704
00:31:58,657 --> 00:32:02,567
who was now a screenwriter in
Hollywood, and I showed him

705
00:32:02,571 --> 00:32:05,871
and his wife my five minute
video of the Texas Chainsaw

706
00:32:05,874 --> 00:32:10,504
Manicure, and he said, you know
what a coincidence, my writing

707
00:32:10,499 --> 00:32:13,999
partner and I have an office
right across the hall from Toby

708
00:32:14,003 --> 00:32:17,023
Hooper, the director of the
original Chainsaw Massacre.

709
00:32:17,016 --> 00:32:22,616
And Toby, was working on
"Poltergeist" at the time,

710
00:32:22,621 --> 00:32:25,371
and he said if you leave
me a copy of the Manicure,

711
00:32:25,374 --> 00:32:27,634
I can maybe walk it into Toby.

712
00:32:27,626 --> 00:32:29,076
I said, well that'd be cool.

713
00:32:29,078 --> 00:32:31,818
I mean that'd be kinda
cool for him to watch it.

714
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:36,280
So I did, and he did,
and Toby watched it,

715
00:32:36,275 --> 00:32:39,725
and Toby loved the Manicure.

716
00:32:39,728 --> 00:32:42,968
And Toby loved my
performance in the Manicure.

717
00:32:42,972 --> 00:32:45,812
And Toby be called in his
producing partner, Steven

718
00:32:45,814 --> 00:32:49,514

the Manicure and loved it.

719
00:32:49,508 --> 00:32:52,028

that was 1984,

720
00:32:52,031 --> 00:32:56,921

casting "Texas Chainsaw II,"

on my little cameo

00:33:00,569 --> 00:33:02,229

723
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:03,531
I never auditioned for it.

724

I got to Austin, Texas

this a real gun?

and I was in the other
elevator, and the door opened

intentionally.

asleep or something,

it, nobody even opened it,

822
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,000
they just brought it back, and
it was like, I just came up,

nobody opened anything.

you know, cutesy kind of
thing, with the big oopsy face,

839
00:38:19,848 --> 00:38:21,958
and the, you know,
skirt being blown up

840
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,000
by the wind, or the dog's
got a hold of the dress.

841
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:26,582
Or you know, those
kind of crazy, almost

842
00:38:26,575 --> 00:38:29,695
unbelievable situations.

843
00:38:29,698 --> 00:38:34,148
The Monster Pinup Calendar
was sort of a collaboration

844
00:38:34,152 --> 00:38:38,382
of ideas where, you know,
we kind of had this idea --

845
00:38:38,377 --> 00:38:40,927
well they had the
idea originally to do,

846
00:38:40,929 --> 00:38:42,399
you know, monster pinups.

847
00:38:42,401 --> 00:38:44,361
You know, there's a number of
different ways we could shoot

848
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,013
it, and a number
of different loos

849
00:38:46,014 --> 00:38:49,034
that we could give the calendar.

850
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:50,977
We sort of all
agreed that we wanted

851
00:38:50,979 --> 00:38:55,479
to keep it more
Elvgren-painting inspired.

852
00:38:55,484 --> 00:38:59,124
Obviously there are liberties
being taken with the way

853
00:38:59,117 --> 00:39:01,077
that they're dressed
and their overall look.

854
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:03,719
Elvgren didn't do a lot
of Halloween themed,

855
00:39:03,722 --> 00:39:05,472
or monster themed kind of stuff.

856
00:39:05,474 --> 00:39:07,734
There was a little bit
of that in his work,

857
00:39:07,726 --> 00:39:10,826
but we sort of took
that and ran with it.

858
00:39:10,829 --> 00:39:14,979
You know, I had done like
zombie pinups before.

859
00:39:14,983 --> 00:39:17,833
I've done a couple of zombie
calendars -- things like that.

860
00:39:17,826 --> 00:39:19,126
But they were always
shot on location,

861
00:39:19,127 --> 00:39:22,747
it was very zombie specific.

862
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:24,331
The freedom of this
calendar allowed

863
00:39:24,332 --> 00:39:27,122
us to sort of go
and try new things.

864
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:30,115
When it was first proposed to
me that we were have a werewolf

865
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:33,028
in the calendar, I thought,
OK, why not make zombies sexy

866
00:39:33,031 --> 00:39:34,281
and get that concept.

867
00:39:34,282 --> 00:39:34,982
You know?

868
00:39:34,983 --> 00:39:36,843
And a lot of these other
things are going on here,

869
00:39:36,835 --> 00:39:38,005
and get how we're
gonna make them .

870
00:39:38,006 --> 00:39:40,196
Sexy I just could
not imagine how

871
00:39:40,198 --> 00:39:42,008
we were gonna take
a beautiful girl,

872
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:46,550
cover her in hair and tattered
clothes, and make that sexy.

873
00:39:46,545 --> 00:39:49,575
But In the end, you know
with the way everything came

874
00:39:49,578 --> 00:39:53,418
together, she wasn't overly
hairy but it still translated,

875
00:39:53,422 --> 00:39:57,732
you know, in the look that
it was definitely a werewolf.

876
00:39:57,726 --> 00:39:59,346
Just that whole
composite background,

877
00:39:59,347 --> 00:40:01,427
we gave it a nice creepy
sort of background,

878
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:04,050
but with her, sort of,
knee-up on the rock,

879
00:40:04,052 --> 00:40:06,822
and was doing this very
provocative type of pose.

880
00:40:06,815 --> 00:40:11,115
[INAUDIBLE] women I've
ever seen, I have to say.

881
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,279
The ghost shot was one that
we had to use our heads up

882
00:40:15,283 --> 00:40:17,773
front while doing
the actual shoot.

883
00:40:17,766 --> 00:40:19,676
You know, how are we
gonna create the illusion

884
00:40:19,678 --> 00:40:21,598
of her floating
through the air, you

885
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,050
know, and actually
being a ghost?

886
00:40:23,051 --> 00:40:25,321
We went ahead and decided
to actually just have

887
00:40:25,323 --> 00:40:29,053
her standing, doing
her poems and then

888
00:40:29,047 --> 00:40:33,467
I did separate shots of
her from the knee down,

889
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:35,032
just sitting on a
stool with her feet

890
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:38,633
sort of dangling out in a few
different angles and whatnot.

891
00:40:38,627 --> 00:40:40,447
And then from there, it was
just sort of making sure

892
00:40:40,449 --> 00:40:43,529
that those angles matched up
with the way she was standing

893
00:40:43,532 --> 00:40:45,542
and everything,
you know, looking

894
00:40:45,544 --> 00:40:46,504
as seamless as possible.

895
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:54,440
With the demon shot -- that's
the one where the young lady is

896
00:40:54,442 --> 00:40:55,912
sitting on the chair,
she's got [INAUDIBLE].

897
00:40:55,914 --> 00:40:59,314
That's directly inspired
by a Gil Elvgren painting.

898
00:40:59,307 --> 00:41:00,007
The pose.

899
00:41:00,008 --> 00:41:02,008
The whole, you know, holding
the pumpkin out and everything.

900
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,720
I kind of enjoy, in
that particular photo,

901
00:41:04,723 --> 00:41:07,173
is having her face
on that pumpkin.

902
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:10,765
You know, creating the
jack-o-lantern with her face.

903
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:13,009
So for me, that was one of the
things I was most proud of.

904
00:41:13,011 --> 00:41:16,171
Making it have that, sort
of, inner glow with her own

905
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:19,764
face on the jack-o-lantern.

906
00:41:19,758 --> 00:41:22,548
This was a tough [INAUDIBLE]
for me to do because of,

907
00:41:22,551 --> 00:41:24,761
you know, kind of
exploring new territories.

908
00:41:24,763 --> 00:41:30,333
They wanted me to put my style
into it, but at the same time,

909
00:41:30,328 --> 00:41:32,568
I sort of wanted to make
sure that the calendar was

910
00:41:32,571 --> 00:41:34,751
a little bit distinct
from my normal, you know,

911
00:41:34,753 --> 00:41:36,773
kind of everyday pinup style.

912
00:41:36,765 --> 00:41:39,945
I think we were hugely
successful in doing that.

913
00:41:39,948 --> 00:41:42,148
You know, the calendar's got,
sort of, my signature style,

914
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:44,890
but at the same
time, is of at least

915
00:41:44,893 --> 00:41:47,153
a small departure from
what I normally do.

916
00:41:47,145 --> 00:41:50,685
A lot of what I actually
learned in doing this calendar

917
00:41:50,689 --> 00:41:54,609
has started to, sort of
filter into my daily work

918
00:41:54,613 --> 00:41:56,773
with my clients, and
models that I work with.

919
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:17,370
[MUSIC]

920
00:42:17,365 --> 00:42:19,665
-So there's a long
history of hearses.

921
00:42:19,668 --> 00:42:23,008
They have motorcycle
hearses, they started out

922
00:42:23,011 --> 00:42:24,711
with the horse-drawn
carriage hearses.

923
00:42:27,365 --> 00:42:29,535
It's a very, very long history.

924
00:42:29,537 --> 00:42:32,097
-Paired up with death, but
they're a beautiful car.

925
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,490
Each hearse is
totally custom built.

926
00:42:34,492 --> 00:42:37,512
-Everbody likes to call
them a hearst with a t.

927
00:42:37,505 --> 00:42:39,705
Pretty much 90%
of the population

928
00:42:39,708 --> 00:42:42,008
tend to get that
wrong, and it just

929
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:45,600
digs into the bottom
my soul, but I'm

930
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,144
done correcting people in it.

931
00:42:47,135 --> 00:42:48,895
If they can't read my
shirt then that's alright.

932
00:42:48,897 --> 00:42:50,627
-You get a lot of funny
looks from people, you know?

933
00:42:50,629 --> 00:42:52,269
Especially driving
through downtown Portland.

934
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:54,610
You know, people look to
see a hearse, and a hearse,

935
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,433
and a hearse, and you
can just watch heads turn

936
00:42:56,434 --> 00:42:59,394
and people are always trying
to figure out what's going on.

937
00:42:59,387 --> 00:43:04,397
-We are as Coffin Cruisers
-- we're in our ninth year.

938
00:43:04,402 --> 00:43:08,452
There was another club
prior to that, and just

939
00:43:08,446 --> 00:43:10,926
like any type of club you're
going to have differences

940
00:43:10,929 --> 00:43:15,269
of opinions and that's kind of
what happened with the old club

941
00:43:15,273 --> 00:43:16,813
that morphed into the new club.

942
00:43:16,805 --> 00:43:17,915
-People start
hearse clubs so you

943
00:43:17,916 --> 00:43:20,456
can be around people that
have the same interest.

944
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:22,958
There's lots of other
car clubs -- you know,

945
00:43:22,961 --> 00:43:24,921
corvette clubs, mustang clubs.

946
00:43:24,923 --> 00:43:28,203
-So we've had a pretty good
membership over the last

947
00:43:28,196 --> 00:43:31,916
several years of, you know,
anywhere between 9-13/14

948
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,270
people, and just like other
cars, they come and go.

949
00:43:36,274 --> 00:43:39,194
They break down and go
away, and typically that's

950
00:43:39,187 --> 00:43:40,577
how we lose most of our members.

951
00:43:40,578 --> 00:43:43,148
-My dad, he wanted
one ever since he

952
00:43:43,151 --> 00:43:45,921
was in the third grade,
and my mom wanted one

953
00:43:45,924 --> 00:43:48,534
since she was in high
school, and they came to me

954
00:43:48,526 --> 00:43:50,606
and said, how would you
feel about having a hearse?

955
00:43:50,608 --> 00:43:53,138
And I said as long
as it's white.

956
00:43:53,141 --> 00:43:54,671
-For me it was the horror stuff.

957
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:56,283
For some reason, ever
since I was a little kid

958
00:43:56,284 --> 00:43:58,994
I remember seeing like a hearse
going by, and it's like, oh

959
00:43:58,987 --> 00:43:59,707
that's sweet.

960
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:00,408
What is that?

961
00:44:00,408 --> 00:44:02,948
It just had -- it was a
slow funeral procession with

962
00:44:02,951 --> 00:44:06,121
motorcycle police escorts, and
it was just amazing to see all

963
00:44:06,124 --> 00:44:07,624
the traffic at a
dead stop, and let

964
00:44:07,615 --> 00:44:09,265
this nice long procession go.

965
00:44:09,267 --> 00:44:10,607
-Right there in
your face with it.

966
00:44:10,608 --> 00:44:13,358
You got all that Detroit
steel right there.

967
00:44:13,361 --> 00:44:17,771
I wanted one and I refused to
drive a minivan by all means,

968
00:44:17,766 --> 00:44:20,476
you soccer moms are out.

969
00:44:20,478 --> 00:44:23,438
-What makes a
hearse different is

970
00:44:23,441 --> 00:44:26,391
they have a purpose, a very
specific purpose, which

971
00:44:26,394 --> 00:44:29,674
is to take those
that have passed

972
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,397
to their final resting spot.

973
00:44:31,399 --> 00:44:34,089
You're talking about
a 7,000-9,000 lb.

974
00:44:34,092 --> 00:44:37,082
vehicle that hold two
people and a dead person,

975
00:44:37,075 --> 00:44:41,115
and is typically
about 20-22 feet long.

976
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,889
They're hard to miss,
so they're fun to drive.

977
00:44:44,893 --> 00:44:48,143
-When we have different car
shows -- things coming up,

978
00:44:48,136 --> 00:44:50,876
or different events
for Halloween,

979
00:44:50,879 --> 00:44:53,399
people will contact the
website, and then I try to get

980
00:44:53,401 --> 00:44:56,261
in contact with them, see
how many cars they want,

981
00:44:56,264 --> 00:44:57,454
if they want to
be all tricked out

982
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:59,805
for Halloween type
things or whatnot.

983
00:44:59,808 --> 00:45:02,658
I remember we actually did
a wedding at the [INAUDIBLE]

984
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:05,360
cemetery that they wanted
the bride and the groom

985
00:45:05,363 --> 00:45:08,823
to come up with the bridesmaids
and groomsmen, all in hearses.

986
00:45:08,817 --> 00:45:10,697
That turned out really well.

987
00:45:10,698 --> 00:45:13,778
My hearse is a 1970
Cadillac Miller Meteor.

988
00:45:16,704 --> 00:45:18,464
It's -- I'm the fourth owner.

989
00:45:18,456 --> 00:45:21,396
It's been owned
by two mortuaries.

990
00:45:21,399 --> 00:45:24,189
It's specific purpose,
it appears to have

991
00:45:24,192 --> 00:45:26,072
been mostly a
children's hearse .

992
00:45:29,467 --> 00:45:31,677
It's painted very light
color, it's beige,

993
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:33,069
so that's a little unusual.

994
00:45:33,071 --> 00:45:37,331
It's usually a
children's-related hearse.

995
00:45:37,325 --> 00:45:39,815
And it shows a lot
of evidence of having

996
00:45:39,818 --> 00:45:41,708
hauled a lot of small coffins.

997
00:45:41,709 --> 00:45:44,459
-Well, my mom's not
too fond of the hearse.

998
00:45:44,462 --> 00:45:46,722
I run a foster home for
medically-fragile, disabled

999
00:45:46,724 --> 00:45:49,874
children, and I used my hearse
as a wheelchair vehicle.

1000
00:45:49,868 --> 00:45:52,258
She kind of cringes a
little bit when we show up

1001
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:53,630
at Dorenbecher's
Children's Hospital

1002
00:45:53,631 --> 00:45:55,811
and I'm rolling out
looking like this,

1003
00:45:55,814 --> 00:45:58,724
with my tattoos pulling
wheelchairs out of the back.

1004
00:45:58,716 --> 00:46:02,266
And Kids have a seat that rides
in the back there as well.

1005
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:04,140
That kind of freaks people out.

1006
00:46:04,142 --> 00:46:05,832
My daughter's doing
this out the window

1007
00:46:05,834 --> 00:46:07,184
as we're driving down the road.

1008
00:46:07,175 --> 00:46:13,175
-My friends and family, you
know, my dad helped me buy it,

1009
00:46:13,181 --> 00:46:15,621
and he's an eight-year-old
conservative Republican.

1010
00:46:19,357 --> 00:46:20,807
Maybe my neighbors
across street that

1011
00:46:20,809 --> 00:46:22,879
are trying to sell their house,
they don't necessarily like it

1012
00:46:22,881 --> 00:46:25,341
so much, but they're
about the only ones.

1013
00:46:25,343 --> 00:46:27,253
-I think you're probably
a hearse fan first,

1014
00:46:27,245 --> 00:46:30,915
if you own a hearse,
before you want to buy one.

1015
00:46:30,919 --> 00:46:32,219
Just 'cause you
like horror stuff,

1016
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,170
if you like horror things
and go buy horror effects,

1017
00:46:34,172 --> 00:46:37,602
you know, a hearse
[INAUDIBLE] first,

1018
00:46:37,595 --> 00:46:40,115
and then probably have
an interest in, you know,

1019
00:46:40,118 --> 00:46:43,218
the dark side of things,
or the macabre stuff.

1020
00:46:43,221 --> 00:46:45,431
-I don't have like, it all deck
out with skeletons and things

1021
00:46:45,433 --> 00:46:46,133
like that.

1022
00:46:46,134 --> 00:46:48,714
I have it very classic,
with the white-wall tires,

1023
00:46:48,706 --> 00:46:50,976
and just want to keep
it as professional

1024
00:46:50,979 --> 00:46:51,869
looking as possible.

1025
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:52,760
So that's my goal.

1026
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:53,930
Just to have,like
a collector's car

1027
00:46:53,932 --> 00:46:55,632
that's a little more
on the macabre side.

1028
00:46:55,633 --> 00:46:57,193
-My cars' all are custom.

1029
00:46:57,185 --> 00:47:00,285
They've got skeletons hanging
from the ceiling in there.

1030
00:47:00,288 --> 00:47:01,748
You know, big fan
white walls was

1031
00:47:01,749 --> 00:47:04,739
kind of in your face vehicles.

1032
00:47:04,742 --> 00:47:06,992
DAD: Those look like
the Halloween props,

1033
00:47:06,985 --> 00:47:08,475
when we put the
Halloween props in.

1034
00:47:08,476 --> 00:47:09,466
-Especially Zilch.

1035
00:47:09,467 --> 00:47:12,447
-Yeah, especially Zilch.

1036
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:15,370
Zilch is a little zombie
baby that we put in the car.

1037
00:47:15,373 --> 00:47:16,103
BOY: He creeps me out.

1038
00:47:16,104 --> 00:47:21,044
DAD: He doesn't like to ride
in the same seat as Zilch.

[MUSIC]

1040
00:47:29,017 --> 00:47:33,027
-My name's Voltaire, and I
have a little bit of trouble

1041
00:47:33,031 --> 00:47:34,801
explaining exactly
what it is that I do,

1042
00:47:34,802 --> 00:47:36,872
because I do a lot
of different things.

1043
00:47:36,865 --> 00:47:38,855
I started out as a
stop-motion animator.

1044
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:42,706
I animated and directed some
of the early MTV and Sci-Fi

1045
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:45,580
channel station IDs --
all of the spookier ones,

1046
00:47:45,583 --> 00:47:46,663
I like to think.

1047
00:47:46,664 --> 00:47:50,094
And I got into
making comic book,

1048
00:47:50,088 --> 00:47:54,418
so I made some comic
books -- sci-fi, horror,

1049
00:47:54,422 --> 00:47:56,782
usually with a touch of comedy.

1050
00:47:56,784 --> 00:47:59,064
And then at some point in the
'90s I learned to play guitar,

1051
00:47:59,057 --> 00:48:02,307
and I, on a dare,
played a live show which

1052
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:04,110
got me signed to a
record label, and I've

1053
00:48:04,112 --> 00:48:05,612
been a recording
artists ever since.

1054

[MUSIC]

1055
00:48:18,336 --> 00:48:22,066
-Everything I do
tends to be macabre.

1056
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:24,990
So there's always,
sort of an appreciation

1057
00:48:24,993 --> 00:48:28,453
or a love for monsters
and the macabre,

1058
00:48:28,446 --> 00:48:33,116
and there's also,
usually, a sense of humor.

1059
00:48:33,121 --> 00:48:39,411
I don't choose to put
the macabre in my music.

1060
00:48:39,407 --> 00:48:45,137
The macabre is just in my
music, because I'm macabre.

1061
00:48:45,143 --> 00:48:47,863
And that may sound really,
I don't know, pretentious

1062
00:48:47,855 --> 00:48:49,955
or corny, but it's
just the truth.

1063
00:48:49,958 --> 00:48:51,938
Everything around
me, I inevitably

1064
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:56,780
find some cynical or
sarcastic way of looking at.

1065
00:48:56,784 --> 00:48:59,874
I have been a fan of
monsters since as far back

1066
00:48:59,867 --> 00:49:01,377
as I can remember.

1067
00:49:01,379 --> 00:49:05,269
My earliest memories were
memories of, you know,

1068
00:49:05,273 --> 00:49:08,873
getting excited because
"King Kong Vs Godzilla"

1069
00:49:08,866 --> 00:49:10,846
was going to be
on the 4:30 movie.

1070
00:49:10,848 --> 00:49:17,138
As a child, if it had a monster
in it, that was all I needed.

1071
00:49:17,135 --> 00:49:20,875
So "King Kong" is
probably my favorite film,

1072
00:49:20,878 --> 00:49:23,128
and as far as I'm concerned
it's a monster movie.

1073
00:49:28,836 --> 00:49:32,176
I was on tour a few years ago,
and I was in Portland Oregon,

1074
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:35,290
and I was in a bookstore
-- no record store,

1075
00:49:35,293 --> 00:49:41,503
and I saw a gentleman
signing a Bauhaus poster,

1076
00:49:41,499 --> 00:49:44,639
and that gentleman was
apparently the bass player --

1077
00:49:44,642 --> 00:49:50,042
David J. And at some point,
when I least expected it,

1078
00:49:50,038 --> 00:49:52,638
the man came up to
me and said, excuse

1079
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,300
me is your name Voltaire?

1080
00:49:54,302 --> 00:49:56,852
And I said, yes.

1081
00:49:56,854 --> 00:49:59,914
He said, did you write a
book called "What is Goth?"

1082
00:49:59,907 --> 00:50:00,607
And I said, yes.

1083
00:50:00,608 --> 00:50:02,298
And he goes, I loved that book.

1084
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,710
Would you autograph it for me?

1085
00:50:03,711 --> 00:50:05,631
And I like, wow -- the
bass player of Bauhaus

1086
00:50:05,633 --> 00:50:07,573
is asking me for my autograph.

1087
00:50:07,565 --> 00:50:08,645
This is pretty epic.

1088

[MUSIC]

1089
00:50:20,398 --> 00:50:24,748
-Yes, I'm a founding father,
if not the godfather, of goth.

1090
00:50:24,752 --> 00:50:28,322
It is said that I wrote the
song, "Bela Lugosi's Dead,"

1091
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:32,196
but actually I
made a contribution

1092
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,780
to the song, in that I wrote
the lyrics and the bass line.

1093
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:40,403
And then Peter saying it as if
he'd been singing it for years.

1094
00:50:40,398 --> 00:50:43,078
And then we recorded the
thing, like the next week.

1095
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,541
So it was all very quick.

1096
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:47,192
And then it was made into
a record very quickly,

1097
00:50:47,185 --> 00:50:48,675
and it took off.

00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:06,760
-Director -- Mr. Scott.

1100
00:51:06,764 --> 00:51:10,494
He saw a performance of ours on
a TV show called "Riverside,"

1101
00:51:10,488 --> 00:51:12,588
and we were doing
"Bela Lugosi's Dead,"

1102
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:16,270
and he ran it Bowie and
Bowie gave it the thumbs up.

1103
00:51:16,274 --> 00:51:19,444
As far as my favorite
type of horror film,

1104
00:51:19,437 --> 00:51:22,667
it's usually
psychological actually.

1105
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:25,310
And the more subtle,
and the horror

1106
00:51:25,313 --> 00:51:27,963
that's implied rather
than shown, I think,

1107
00:51:27,955 --> 00:51:30,155
is much more potent.

When you're -- we you
watch someone on stage

then we're going to hold back.

The story goes back to the
Sweet Meat's slaughterhouse.

1120
00:52:03,831 --> 00:52:07,331
It was found in the late
1800s by someone named Wilhelm

1121

Schroder, who industrialized
butchery with the machines.

1122
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:16,909

machines by the townspeople,

the Sweet Meat's
Slaughter remained

empty until we came along.

Kick ass, and then you're
gonna be proud of yourself,

you know, slaughterhouse,
kind of dirty south --

1131

more the embrace of
raw industrial sound.

1132
00:52:46,344 --> 00:52:50,164
It's not clean, it's not
perfect, but it is sincere.

1133
00:52:50,157 --> 00:52:53,527
-So If you want to do
a horror kind of thing,

1134
00:52:53,531 --> 00:52:54,991
do a horror kind of thing.

Don't just get one monster,
get all the monster.

creative outlet I have,

horror films have wormed
their way into it.

-Started working on
independent feature films.

1145

from being a blood

guy to dealing with
the body parts.

-To which I'm really,
really grateful,

1148
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:33,458
because it's made my work a
lot better and more interesting

1149
00:53:33,461 --> 00:53:34,451
than it use be, I think.

1150
00:53:34,452 --> 00:53:36,392
-To washing off the
naked women when

1151
00:53:36,394 --> 00:53:38,424
they were done doing
their blood scenes.

1152
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:39,796
-I wrote a book
called "Shadow Play:

1153
00:53:39,797 --> 00:53:42,367
Philosophy and Psychology
of the Modern Horror Film,"

1154
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:46,860
to explore aspects of the psyche
that we're trying to leave

1155
00:53:46,864 --> 00:53:49,874
behind as we reach
for civilization.

1156
00:53:49,867 --> 00:53:53,307
And horror films are
a perfect fantasy

1157
00:53:53,311 --> 00:53:54,971
arena to process all that stuff.

1158
00:53:54,972 --> 00:53:57,532
-Started developing a
distribution company

1159
00:53:57,525 --> 00:54:00,585
to distribute my own
movies, and then that

1160
00:54:00,588 --> 00:54:03,438
was the creation of "Iron
Virgin" and "Stripper Land,"

1161
00:54:03,441 --> 00:54:08,361
of writing and directing and
co-producing horror movies

1162
00:54:08,356 --> 00:54:10,466
with our own company,
to open the doors

1163
00:54:10,468 --> 00:54:11,418
to bigger and better things.

DANIELLE ANATHEMA: I
always love photography

1165
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,210
because I can't paint.

1166
00:54:14,211 --> 00:54:18,911
Basically I like to capture an
image that looks like a movie

constantly terrified.

1170
00:54:27,124 --> 00:54:28,974
Kind of in my
junior high years I

1171
00:54:28,966 --> 00:54:31,476
just started to just try
and find the beauty in it,

1172
00:54:31,479 --> 00:54:33,939
and just watching horror
movie after horror movie,

1173
00:54:33,941 --> 00:54:37,301
and just got into the
makeup, and just realized

1174
00:54:37,295 --> 00:54:40,375
that it could be a
very beautiful thing

1175
00:54:40,378 --> 00:54:43,998
with such deep emotion, and
just kind of went from there.

1176
00:54:44,001 --> 00:54:46,641
-Horroregon.net -- which
is a website for news,

1177
00:54:46,644 --> 00:54:47,744
reviews, and interviews.

1178
00:54:47,735 --> 00:54:50,335
But really it's just me
finding a reason to get online

1179
00:54:50,338 --> 00:54:51,868
and trying to collect up stuff.

1180
00:54:51,869 --> 00:54:55,349
We will touch on national things
if it's something that we find

1181
00:54:55,353 --> 00:54:58,483
interesting or it comes
to us, but absolutely,

1182
00:54:58,476 --> 00:55:01,366
100%, specifically
Portland, and Oregon horror.

1183
00:55:01,369 --> 00:55:08,569
If you really wear your passions
outwardly and pursue them,

1184
00:55:08,566 --> 00:55:11,726
there's a large swath of the --
what you consider the average

1185
00:55:11,729 --> 00:55:14,559
pedestrian, Oregeonian
and Portlander,

1186
00:55:14,562 --> 00:55:18,092
that will follow you,
and will be enthused.

1187
00:55:18,085 --> 00:55:20,735
-Scream is for horror lovers.

1188
00:55:20,738 --> 00:55:23,958
If you are a fan of horror,
you want to read our magazine.

1189
00:55:23,961 --> 00:55:27,881
We cover classic horror
from the early 1920s,

1190
00:55:27,875 --> 00:55:29,175
right up to the present day.

1191
00:55:29,176 --> 00:55:32,596
Measuring up to Fangoria is
obviously a huge deal for us.

1192
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,830
They have got a long
history -- even just

1193
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:36,912
the name itself
carries such a cache.

1194
00:55:36,914 --> 00:55:41,274
-What makes me Moviecynics.com
unique is that, you know,

1195
00:55:41,268 --> 00:55:42,808
we're kind of assholes.

1196
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:45,050
We tell it like it is, but
we try and be constructive

1197
00:55:45,052 --> 00:55:49,312
at least, especially when
working with indy filmmakers.

1198
00:55:49,306 --> 00:55:50,646
When it comes to
Hollywood horror movies

1199
00:55:50,648 --> 00:55:52,098
we'll terror those things apart.

1200
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:54,689
Especially if they're garbage,
which a lot of them are.

1201
00:55:54,692 --> 00:55:57,222
-I usually don't go into
interviews unless I'm pretty

1202
00:55:57,224 --> 00:56:00,684
convinced A) That I"m going to
get something that the readers

1203
00:56:00,678 --> 00:56:04,018
are gonna want, and B) It's
kind of a personal thing,

1204
00:56:04,021 --> 00:56:05,931
where it's like, I
want to be enriched.

1205
00:56:05,933 --> 00:56:08,943
I've turned down interviews
with major horror stars

1206
00:56:08,936 --> 00:56:11,846
because I didn't feel like I
could learn anything from them.

1207
00:56:11,849 --> 00:56:13,409
-Since launching
MailOrderZOMBIE.com,

1208
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:16,741
I've had an opportunity to
attend like the the Cripticon

1209
00:56:16,744 --> 00:56:18,934
Horror Convention, Horror
Hound Weekend in Indianapolis

1210
00:56:18,926 --> 00:56:22,906
or Cincinnati as a
fan, but also then

1211
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:24,800
as a podcaster covering
it for my podcast.

1212
00:56:24,802 --> 00:56:26,592
And then sitting in
on panels as well.

1213
00:56:26,594 --> 00:56:28,494
And it's been a lot of
fun being able to flash

1214
00:56:28,486 --> 00:56:30,686
my MailOrderZOMBIE.com
business card

1215
00:56:30,688 --> 00:56:32,088
and say, hey I'm with
MailOrderZOMBIE.com,

1216
00:56:32,089 --> 00:56:32,909
can I interview you?

1217
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:35,240
And then talk to people like
Tom Savini, Ken Foree, you know,

1218
00:56:35,242 --> 00:56:36,972
people that I looked up to
growing up when I finally

1219
00:56:36,974 --> 00:56:38,844
discovered horror
movies full on.

1220
00:56:38,836 --> 00:56:40,156
And be able to
connect with them,

1221
00:56:40,157 --> 00:56:42,507
and just thank them
for their work.

1222
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:45,330
-I always look at
interviews like first dates.

1223
00:56:45,332 --> 00:56:48,372
You know, where on a first
date you're with someone,

1224
00:56:48,365 --> 00:56:50,575
you're going, tell
me about your job.

1225
00:56:50,578 --> 00:56:51,578
That's kinda what we're doing.

1226
00:56:51,579 --> 00:56:53,899
And as long as you are
interested and listen --

1227
00:56:53,901 --> 00:56:57,231
so often interviewers, I think,
they're slaves to their notes

1228
00:56:57,234 --> 00:57:00,224
and they're so busy preparing
for the next prepared question

1229
00:57:00,217 --> 00:57:01,887
that they're missing
all this gold.

1230
00:57:01,889 --> 00:57:03,359
-And they asked me,
would I go and cover it,

1231
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,150
and speak to people,
and get a feel

1232
00:57:05,152 --> 00:57:07,812
for what horror conventions
in the US Are like.

1233
00:57:07,805 --> 00:57:10,635
In the UK, they tend to be
a lot lower key than this.

1234
00:57:10,638 --> 00:57:12,148
We don't have the
same kind of madness.

1235
00:57:12,149 --> 00:57:13,859
We don't have the same
people in costumes.

1236
00:57:13,861 --> 00:57:17,101
So it's been a crazy experience
for me to be here this weekend,

1237
00:57:17,104 --> 00:57:19,374
and just see the
level of fandom,

1238
00:57:19,366 --> 00:57:22,246
and just how much the bar
has been raised in America.

1239
00:57:22,249 --> 00:57:24,359
-I [INAUDIBLE] pretty hard
recently with Kate Beckinsale,

1240
00:57:24,361 --> 00:57:26,451
I'll say that.

1241
00:57:26,454 --> 00:57:29,304
Just because it's Kate
Beckinsale, come on,

1242
00:57:29,296 --> 00:57:30,246
and she smells amazing.

1243
00:57:30,247 --> 00:57:32,077
I think I've got
Elvira coming up,

1244
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:34,219
which is another
one that you go --

1245
00:57:34,221 --> 00:57:35,551
do you want to talk to Elvira?

1246
00:57:35,553 --> 00:57:37,623
Fuck yeah, I want to talk
to Elvira, but after a while

1247
00:57:37,615 --> 00:57:39,455
you go, oh I get it.

1248
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,346
There's this
infrastructure in place.

1249
00:57:41,348 --> 00:57:42,398
We're here to pimp your film.

1250
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,649
We're here to pimp your book.

1251
00:57:43,651 --> 00:57:46,481
We're here to find
some stuff about --

1252
00:57:46,484 --> 00:57:48,274
the reason that brought
you to the table.

1253
00:57:48,265 --> 00:57:49,565
-Nine times out of
ten, I'm probably

1254
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,807
going to have way more fun
with an independent horror

1255
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:54,520
film than a Hollywood
horror film.

1256
00:57:54,522 --> 00:57:59,092
The Hollywood horror film
is catered to teenagers.

1257
00:57:59,086 --> 00:58:00,986
-I don't care if you
don't have a lot of money.

1258
00:58:00,988 --> 00:58:03,598
Spend some time on your script
developing your characters,

1259
00:58:03,601 --> 00:58:05,221
and make them somebody
that, you know,

1260
00:58:05,222 --> 00:58:06,572
I want to be invested with.

1261
00:58:06,574 --> 00:58:08,284
I want to spend time with
these guys for, you know,

1262
00:58:08,275 --> 00:58:09,875
90 minutes, whatever long
your movie's gonna be.

1263
00:58:09,877 --> 00:58:12,067
-It doesn't quite resonate
with people that grew up

1264
00:58:12,069 --> 00:58:16,769
in the '80s, and early '90s,
and '70s, watching just

1265
00:58:16,774 --> 00:58:19,624
brutal horror movies
that were entertaining,

1266
00:58:19,617 --> 00:58:22,877
well done and well
put together, but not

1267
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,930
designed to get as many
people into the theater

1268
00:58:24,932 --> 00:58:26,112
seats as possible.

1269
00:58:26,113 --> 00:58:27,433
-If your characters
aren't somebody

1270
00:58:27,434 --> 00:58:28,544
that I'm going to
care about, I'm

1271
00:58:28,536 --> 00:58:29,866
not going to care
about your movie, man.

1272
00:58:29,867 --> 00:58:31,827
I don't care how big
your special effects are,

1273
00:58:31,829 --> 00:58:33,609
how bloody your
special effects are.

1274
00:58:33,611 --> 00:58:35,521
Give me some characters
that I care about.

1275
00:58:35,523 --> 00:58:38,403
-So you find this current
run of PG-13 horror films

1276
00:58:38,395 --> 00:58:43,275
that are just disposable,
uninteresting, cookie cutter,

1277
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,390
formulaic.

1278
00:58:44,391 --> 00:58:46,561
-And don't take advantage of me.

1279
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:47,864
Don't treat me like an idiot.

1280
00:58:47,855 --> 00:58:50,975
I've watched a lot of
horror movies, man.

1281
00:58:50,978 --> 00:58:52,888
You know, I have
certain expectations

1282
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:54,880
to be treated as an equal
here, as a horror fan.

1283
00:58:54,882 --> 00:58:56,282
You know, if you're
making a horror movie,

1284
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:59,053
I assume you like
horror movies as well,

1285
00:58:59,046 --> 00:59:00,366
so let's go on this
journey together.

1286
00:59:00,367 --> 00:59:02,807
Don't talk down to me, and
don't give me something

1287
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:04,580
that you think I need to
see because every horror

1288
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:05,342
movie has it.

1289
00:59:05,342 --> 00:59:06,472
You know, I like
nudity, whatever.

1290
00:59:06,473 --> 00:59:08,243
I like the special effects,
whatever, but give me

1291
00:59:08,235 --> 00:59:10,365
a solid story and give me
characters that I care about.

1292
00:59:10,367 --> 00:59:11,647
-You gotta have the violence.

1293
00:59:11,649 --> 00:59:14,899
I mean, tension goes a
long way, but in the end

1294
00:59:14,902 --> 00:59:18,062
you want that tension to lead
up to some actual violence.

1295
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:21,355
You want to see the red
stuff on the screen.

1296
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:23,548
I can probably count on my hand
the amount of successful horror

1297
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:26,340
movies that, you know,
had all that tension

1298
00:59:26,343 --> 00:59:27,583
but didn't really
have the violence,

1299
00:59:27,575 --> 00:59:29,535
and within the
last 20 years, you

1300
00:59:29,536 --> 00:59:30,856
don't really see that very much.

1301
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:32,478
-I've always said that
being a horror fan

1302
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:36,739
is kind of like panning for
gold in a river of shit,

1303
00:59:36,744 --> 00:59:40,384
because you go
through a lot of crap.

1304
00:59:40,377 --> 00:59:44,417
-My name is Nowal, and
I love horror films

1305
00:59:44,421 --> 00:59:47,001
because when I was
about three years old,

1306
00:59:47,004 --> 00:59:50,524
my family was watching "Hell
Raiser 2" in the basement.

1307
00:59:50,517 --> 00:59:54,917
-I really enjoy the blood,
guts, and gore aspect of it.

1308
00:59:54,922 --> 00:59:56,772
The fact that it
always made my mom

1309
00:59:56,774 --> 00:59:58,344
scream whenever certain
things happened,

1310
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:01,175
and I kind of got a sick
little thrill out of that.

1311
01:00:01,178 --> 01:00:04,258
-I remember watching "Hell
Raiser" when I was far too

1312
01:00:04,261 --> 01:00:06,261
young to be watching
"Hell Raiser."

1313
01:00:06,263 --> 01:00:09,183
-And I love the hooks
impaling the man's

1314
01:00:09,176 --> 01:00:10,446
flesh towards the end.

1315
01:00:10,447 --> 01:00:12,217
-I went downstairs and
hid behind the couch

1316
01:00:12,219 --> 01:00:13,299
and watched "Hell Rasier 2."

1317
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:16,230
Nobody noticed I was there
until the movie was over,

1318
01:00:16,233 --> 01:00:18,933
and at one point I just
imagined something happened

1319
01:00:18,926 --> 01:00:20,456
and was like, oh shit!

1320
01:00:20,457 --> 01:00:22,117
And then my family's
like, oh OK.

1321
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:23,999
Number one, you're
three, don't swear.

1322
01:00:24,001 --> 01:00:26,881
Number two, you're three and
it's like 11:00 at night,

1323
01:00:26,884 --> 01:00:30,204
why aren't you in bed, but
I remember seeing pinhead

1324
01:00:30,197 --> 01:00:33,577
for the first time at three, and
instead of being afraid of him,

1325
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:37,680
I was like in awe of
just this character.

1326
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:41,855
It was the first horror
icon, as pinhead, that I saw,

1327
01:00:41,859 --> 01:00:43,519
and I fell in love
with horror movies

1328
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,960
at three years old
from his performance.

1329
01:00:45,963 --> 01:00:47,523
So I think if I
ever got the chance

1330
01:00:47,524 --> 01:00:50,304
to meet Doug Bradley I
would probably pass out.

1331
01:00:50,297 --> 01:00:51,907
Just that excited.

1332
01:00:51,909 --> 01:00:57,619
[MUSIC]

1333
01:00:57,624 --> 01:01:03,364
-I mean, I've been told I'm the
greatest actor who ever lived,

1334
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,450
which I've been told.

1335
01:01:06,453 --> 01:01:11,663
So take a backseat, James Mason,
Marlon Brando, the rest of you.

1336
01:01:11,658 --> 01:01:13,228
Numero uno.

1337
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:14,380
I mean, that's nuts.

1338
01:01:14,381 --> 01:01:16,461
My name is Doug Bradley.

1339
01:01:16,463 --> 01:01:20,173
I am best known, particularly
at horror conventions

1340
01:01:20,167 --> 01:01:25,177
for having played Pinhead
in the "Hellraiser" series.

1341
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:30,312
I've also done a ton of other
movies, TV work, stage work.

1342
01:01:30,307 --> 01:01:31,557
I wrote a book even.

1343
01:01:31,558 --> 01:01:35,078
I was a fan of horror
movies as a teenager,

1344
01:01:35,082 --> 01:01:37,202
before I knew I was
going to be an actor.

1345
01:01:37,204 --> 01:01:39,684
And when I became
an actor I didn't

1346
01:01:39,676 --> 01:01:46,206
have any particular ambition
to work in the genre,

1347
01:01:46,213 --> 01:01:48,643
so the two have come
together quite happily.

1348
01:01:48,635 --> 01:01:51,505
When I first started
doing the conventions,

1349
01:01:51,508 --> 01:01:55,438
I was slightly freaked
out by mom dad,

1350
01:01:55,442 --> 01:01:58,212
and the kids coming to my table.

1351
01:01:58,205 --> 01:02:01,285
And the parents will be saying,
oh he loves your movies,

1352
01:02:01,288 --> 01:02:03,808
and I'm looking at him and
he's like seven years old,

1353
01:02:03,811 --> 01:02:09,771
and I, you know, not really
comfortable with that.

1354
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:15,607
But I now have so many
people come to my table who

1355
01:02:15,612 --> 01:02:22,182
are clearly entirely together
and, you know, rational, calm

1356
01:02:22,179 --> 01:02:26,209
human beings who
encountered these movies

1357
01:02:26,213 --> 01:02:29,593
when there were
6, 7, 8 year olds.

1358
01:02:29,586 --> 01:02:32,826
The evidence of 20 years
of coming to conventions

1359
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:37,350
is telling me that
it doesn't really,

1360
01:02:37,354 --> 01:02:40,084
you know, OK people will
have nightmares fora couple

1361
01:02:40,077 --> 01:02:45,327
of months, a couple of weeks,
a few nights, whatever.

1362
01:02:45,332 --> 01:02:48,772
But nobody seems, to me, to be
permanently scarred or damaged.

1363
01:02:53,921 --> 01:02:57,011
-I'm really excited
-- I got two VIP

1364
01:02:57,014 --> 01:02:59,504
tickets to Crypticon
for my birthday.

1365
01:02:59,496 --> 01:03:02,006
I get to meet Doug
Bradley -- Pinhead ,

1366
01:03:02,009 --> 01:03:04,979
in all of the most important
"Hellraiser" films.

1367
01:03:04,982 --> 01:03:07,372
When I meet Doug
Bradley, I'm pretty

1368
01:03:07,374 --> 01:03:09,324
sure I'll have the
most enormous nerdgasm

1369
01:03:09,316 --> 01:03:11,836
in the history of ever.

1370
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:15,399
I'm gonna be nervous -- I
already am nervous to meet him.

1371
01:03:15,402 --> 01:03:17,632
I honestly don't know
what I'm going to do.

1372
01:03:17,634 --> 01:03:20,314
It's one of those moments
where like, don't be a freak.

1373
01:03:20,307 --> 01:03:21,437
Just do not be a freak.

1374
01:03:21,438 --> 01:03:31,538
[MUSIC]

1375
01:03:31,538 --> 01:03:36,048
-I walked around a little bit,
saw some awesome movie posters.

1376
01:03:36,053 --> 01:03:39,713
Then I turned a corner and
there was Doug Bradley,

1377
01:03:39,706 --> 01:03:40,526
and I freaked out.

1378
01:03:40,527 --> 01:03:42,427
I had to walk away.

1379
01:03:42,429 --> 01:03:44,029
I couldn't handle myself.

1380
01:03:44,031 --> 01:03:47,761
So I turned the corner,
and there was Dee Wallace.

1381
01:03:47,764 --> 01:03:49,554
And again I had to keep walking.

1382
01:03:49,546 --> 01:03:50,796
I'm still freaking out.

1383
01:03:50,797 --> 01:03:53,797
Like honestly, freaking out.

1384
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:56,690
And it's gonna be
even more when I

1385
01:03:56,693 --> 01:03:58,903
go back to actually
meet Doug Bradley.

1386
01:04:02,329 --> 01:04:04,109
It was awesome.

1387
01:04:04,111 --> 01:04:06,111
I'm really proud
that I didn't vomit,

1388
01:04:06,113 --> 01:04:07,573
because I though that
was gonna happen.

1389
01:04:07,574 --> 01:04:11,384
And I showed him my tattoo,
and he translated it himself.

1390
01:04:11,378 --> 01:04:15,528
[SPEAKING LATIN] Wow.

1391
01:04:15,532 --> 01:04:16,642
-He didn't ask what it meant.

1392
01:04:16,643 --> 01:04:18,763
He's like, wait
-- do I look like

1393
01:04:18,755 --> 01:04:20,075
someone who cares
what God thinks?

1394
01:04:20,077 --> 01:04:20,777
In Latin.

1395
01:04:20,777 --> 01:04:21,497
That's amazing.

1396
01:04:21,498 --> 01:04:24,638
I was like -- and then I told
him that I've been a fan since

1397
01:04:24,641 --> 01:04:28,211
I was three, and so we shared
stories about things like,

1398
01:04:28,205 --> 01:04:30,315
you remember
watching it at three?

1399
01:04:30,317 --> 01:04:31,597
And I was like, yeah.

1400
01:04:31,598 --> 01:04:32,458
How could I not?

1401
01:04:32,459 --> 01:04:36,989
It was "Hellraiser." my friend
Brinn, that does my tattoes

1402
01:04:36,994 --> 01:04:39,844
can photocopy the signature
and tattoo it on me

1403
01:04:39,836 --> 01:04:42,986
when I get home. 'Cause I'm
definitely planning some kind

1404
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:45,970
of Hellraiser-themed tattoo now.

1405
01:04:45,973 --> 01:04:47,903
I have been for a while,
but now it's official.

1406
01:04:47,895 --> 01:04:49,375
It's gonna happen.

1407
01:04:49,376 --> 01:04:51,836
My experience at Criptocon
has been great so far.

1408
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:53,568
I'm gonna try and make
it back next year.

1409
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:55,050
See who else is here.

1410
01:04:55,052 --> 01:04:56,042
It's really fun.

1411
01:04:56,043 --> 01:05:00,013
I had a lot of -- I'm gonna
have so many stories to tell.

1412
01:05:00,007 --> 01:05:00,997
I didn't vomit!

1413
01:05:07,935 --> 01:05:10,085
-Hold on one second,
I'm going out of frame,

1414
01:05:10,087 --> 01:05:12,417
but I'll be right back.

1415
01:05:12,419 --> 01:05:16,779
I still say it's the
standard that CGI effects,

1416
01:05:16,783 --> 01:05:19,273
though helpful,
though cost effective,

1417
01:05:19,266 --> 01:05:22,146
will never replace
good, crafted,

1418
01:05:22,149 --> 01:05:24,619
animatronics and makeup effects.

1419
01:05:24,621 --> 01:05:27,271
-Hello!

1420
01:05:27,274 --> 01:05:31,084
So it was a six-piece
application.

1421
01:05:31,078 --> 01:05:34,998
There was like one
piece that was here,

1422
01:05:35,002 --> 01:05:39,832
then cheeks, including
around the ears.

1423
01:05:42,629 --> 01:05:43,559
Neck .

1424
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:47,190
From the eyes, up here,
and then another piece

1425
01:05:47,194 --> 01:05:49,504
over the back of the head.

1426
01:05:49,496 --> 01:05:53,536
It did get simplified to a
two-piece application later.

1427
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:56,020
The nails, preset in the latex.

1428
01:05:56,023 --> 01:06:01,683
So as the pieces get glued on
to my head, the nails go on.

1429
01:06:01,678 --> 01:06:05,108
So when people ask
me, did it hurt?

1430
01:06:05,112 --> 01:06:09,042
Did you really have nails
banged in your head?

1431
01:06:09,036 --> 01:06:10,996
I say, yes I did.

1432
01:06:10,998 --> 01:06:12,958
I have very good healing flesh.

1433
01:06:12,959 --> 01:06:15,349
And I'm sponsored by Tylenol.

1434
01:06:15,352 --> 01:06:19,372
-I started modifying
masks when I was little.

1435
01:06:19,366 --> 01:06:22,376
I would take masks that
I had around the house,

1436
01:06:22,379 --> 01:06:26,469
or that I got really cheap,
and paint them, and cut them

1437
01:06:26,473 --> 01:06:28,083
up so they would
fit my face better.

1438
01:06:28,075 --> 01:06:31,345
And try and hot glue them,
and random things like that.

1439
01:06:31,348 --> 01:06:33,168
-I also just had a
fascination with monsters,

1440
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:35,480
as a young boy, who wouldn't?

1441
01:06:35,482 --> 01:06:38,892
It kind me to mask
making when I got older,

1442
01:06:38,885 --> 01:06:42,205
and get into some
special effects hobbies ,

1443
01:06:42,209 --> 01:06:43,289
I guess you could say.

1444
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:45,730
Nothing too professional,
but a lot of fun.

1445
01:06:45,732 --> 01:06:51,652
I have, the Wolfman, and
Frankenstein, and Dracula.

1446
01:06:51,648 --> 01:06:55,568
And on my back I have the
Bride of Frankenstein.

1447
01:06:55,572 --> 01:06:58,352
-My name is Dutch, and I'm
a professional face and body

1448
01:06:58,345 --> 01:06:59,375
artist.

1449
01:06:59,376 --> 01:07:02,436
The piece I'm working on right
now is gonna be, sort of,

1450
01:07:02,439 --> 01:07:06,739
a corset made out of human body
parts all stitched together.

1451
01:07:06,743 --> 01:07:09,573
It's a step by step process
where you have kinda layer

1452
01:07:09,566 --> 01:07:11,846
things on, and detail
it out as you go,

1453
01:07:11,848 --> 01:07:14,558
and then the finishing touches
kind of all comes together,

1454
01:07:14,561 --> 01:07:16,381
and you get your
finished product.

1455
01:07:16,383 --> 01:07:18,983
-I started out as a
makeup artist back

1456
01:07:18,975 --> 01:07:24,235
in, I guess about 1989/1990
in Victoria, British Columbia,

1457
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:25,701
Canada.

1458
01:07:25,702 --> 01:07:27,152
I started doing
make up for the film

1459
01:07:27,154 --> 01:07:29,174
school that was
there at the time.

1460
01:07:29,166 --> 01:07:30,646
And the very first
"Final Destination,"

1461
01:07:30,647 --> 01:07:32,097
I was the effects designer.

1462
01:07:32,099 --> 01:07:35,759
And I've also done a slew
of Sci-fi Channel Network,

1463
01:07:35,762 --> 01:07:38,412
you know, creature of
the week type movies.

1464
01:07:38,405 --> 01:07:40,985
Many of those.

1465
01:07:40,987 --> 01:07:45,217
The last say, 3 or 4 years, I've
been teaching makeup effects,

1466
01:07:45,222 --> 01:07:48,422
as well as writing and
directing my own feature films.

1467
01:07:48,415 --> 01:07:50,945
-I'm just going for
patches of skin,

1468
01:07:50,947 --> 01:07:53,527
and eventually I'll paint
the Lisa's on there --

1469
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:56,870
do some others texturing with
the skin, and stuff like that.

1470
01:07:56,873 --> 01:07:58,823
And it will look really
sharp when it's all done.

1471
01:07:58,815 --> 01:08:01,375
-I think what makes it
New Image College of Fine

1472
01:08:01,378 --> 01:08:04,588
Arts different than any other
school in North America,

1473
01:08:04,591 --> 01:08:08,591
basically is the fact that we
actually make feature films

1474
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:11,955
at the school that end
up being distributed.

1475
01:08:11,958 --> 01:08:16,028
So we specialize in horror
movies, monster movies,

1476
01:08:16,032 --> 01:08:19,912
and the acting department --
the acting students get to act

1477
01:08:19,906 --> 01:08:21,476
in the feature
film, and the makeup

1478
01:08:21,478 --> 01:08:23,058
department does the make up.

1479
01:08:23,059 --> 01:08:24,939
My favorite special
effect that I've done

1480
01:08:24,941 --> 01:08:28,391
would be working on David
Cronenberg's "Existence."

1481
01:08:28,385 --> 01:08:30,945
I was in Toronto for
about six months.

1482
01:08:30,947 --> 01:08:34,257
Cronenberg is my, you
know, my filmmaking idol.

1483
01:08:34,261 --> 01:08:38,581
I mean, being fellow Canadian,
Cronenberg is God to me.

1484
01:08:38,575 --> 01:08:41,505
So to work on that, and
have him coming around

1485
01:08:41,508 --> 01:08:45,218
while I'm sculpting one of the
little amphibious creatures,

1486
01:08:45,222 --> 01:08:47,052
and he'd come by and
say, oh that's cool,

1487
01:08:47,053 --> 01:08:48,273
you know, I love
what you're doing.

1488
01:08:48,265 --> 01:08:49,465
I'm just like, oh!

1489
01:08:49,466 --> 01:08:50,446
I'm in heaven, you know?

1490
01:08:50,447 --> 01:08:54,457
-Our school is handing
out a crap ton of money

1491
01:08:54,461 --> 01:08:57,331
and scholarships, so
we sponsored this.

1492
01:08:57,334 --> 01:08:58,804
And it was just a
chance to kind of,

1493
01:08:58,795 --> 01:09:00,555
you know, see some of the
talent south of the border,

1494
01:09:00,557 --> 01:09:02,917
and you know, find some people
that might be interested.

1495
01:09:02,919 --> 01:09:05,829
You know, 'cause a lot of people
don't really know where to get

1496
01:09:05,832 --> 01:09:07,702
started in this industry,
or how to get started.

1497
01:09:07,704 --> 01:09:09,904
So, you know, it's
just education really,

1498
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:12,896
is why we put this on, and it
gives ever body else a chance

1499
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:17,689
that loves this sort of stuff
to try their hand at it.

1500
01:09:17,694 --> 01:09:21,384
-They typically give
everybody an identical kit,

1501
01:09:21,378 --> 01:09:23,688
and then they usually have some
sort of mystery ingredient.

1502
01:09:23,690 --> 01:09:25,700
So they want you to
do different stuff.

1503
01:09:25,702 --> 01:09:27,532
With this one, it
was more theme based.

1504
01:09:27,534 --> 01:09:30,084
They wanted beauty, as
well as, you know, a beast.

1505
01:09:30,076 --> 01:09:32,456
So it was the beauty and
the beast was the theme,

1506
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:35,869
and I just wanted to personally
deviate from the zombie stuff.

1507
01:09:35,872 --> 01:09:37,842
You know, I mean everyone
can slap blood on people,

1508
01:09:37,844 --> 01:09:39,584
and make them all gory,
and make a zombie,

1509
01:09:39,576 --> 01:09:41,346
but I wanted to go in
a different direction.

1510
01:09:41,348 --> 01:09:43,158
What I'm hoping
to get from this,

1511
01:09:43,159 --> 01:09:44,639
I want a little bit
more in-depth knowledge

1512
01:09:44,641 --> 01:09:46,211
about what I'm working
with, so that I can

1513
01:09:46,213 --> 01:09:48,503
take my skill set
to the next level.

1514
01:09:48,495 --> 01:09:49,765
-I love Tom Savini.

1515
01:09:49,766 --> 01:09:51,466
He will always be Sex
Machine in my heart.

1516
01:09:51,468 --> 01:09:53,698
I'm sorry, I've always
wanted those pants.

1517
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:55,830
-I did stumble across
a documentary called

1518
01:09:55,832 --> 01:09:58,602
"Scream Greats Volume
One," from Fangoria.

1519
01:09:58,595 --> 01:10:01,585
It's about Ton Savini,
and that became my entry

1520
01:10:01,588 --> 01:10:05,258
into a lot of modern
zombie effects, makeup

1521
01:10:05,262 --> 01:10:06,852
effects, and things like that.

1522
01:10:06,853 --> 01:10:08,683
-When people think
horror, that's

1523
01:10:08,675 --> 01:10:11,375
one of the main names that
comes to people's minds.

1524
01:10:11,378 --> 01:10:16,318
[MUSIC]

1525
01:10:16,323 --> 01:10:19,803
-I got so scared watching
movies when I was a kid,

1526
01:10:19,796 --> 01:10:22,726
that I decided I wanted to
-- I wanted to scare people.

1527
01:10:22,729 --> 01:10:23,549
I still have that.

1528
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:25,070
I still have to scare people.

1529
01:10:25,071 --> 01:10:27,741
I scare my daughter at
home, you know, constantly.

1530
01:10:27,744 --> 01:10:30,294
My grandson, who's 9 years old.

1531
01:10:30,287 --> 01:10:30,987
It's a thrill.

1532
01:10:30,987 --> 01:10:31,827
It's a thrill.

1533
01:10:31,828 --> 01:10:32,768
It's the same thrill.

1534
01:10:32,769 --> 01:10:34,549
I mean why do you go
to the amusement park

1535
01:10:34,551 --> 01:10:36,691
and have somebody strap
you into a machine

1536
01:10:36,693 --> 01:10:38,153
and shoot you up into the sky.

1537
01:10:38,154 --> 01:10:39,704
You pay for that.

1538
01:10:39,696 --> 01:10:41,806
Just like you pay to
go see a horror movie.

1539
01:10:41,808 --> 01:10:44,368
The movie "A Man Of
A Thousand Faces."

1540
01:10:44,371 --> 01:10:47,671
I saw that movie when I was
11 years old, and that was it.

1541
01:10:47,674 --> 01:10:49,294
From that day on I
wanted to be the guy

1542
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:50,526
that creates the monsters.

1543
01:10:50,527 --> 01:10:52,037
Before that, I thought
they were real.

1544
01:10:52,038 --> 01:10:53,648
You know, and they were real.

1545
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:55,910
And that magic is
gone forever, you

1546
01:10:55,912 --> 01:10:57,552
know, once you get
behind the camera,

1547
01:10:57,554 --> 01:10:59,454
you know, behind the scenes.

1548
01:10:59,446 --> 01:11:00,266
That's the sad thing.

1549
01:11:00,267 --> 01:11:02,287
That's the irony that
most kids don't realize.

1550
01:11:02,289 --> 01:11:05,069
They want to be involved in
movies for the magic that some

1551
01:11:05,071 --> 01:11:09,331
-- the saw, but it kills the
magic forever, as you know.

1552
01:11:09,326 --> 01:11:10,176
Yeah.

1553
01:11:10,176 --> 01:11:13,476
The only two movies that have
scared me were "The Exorcist"

1554
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,990
and "Alien," you know.
'Cause so many times you

1555
01:11:15,992 --> 01:11:18,682
go to see a movie and you're
thinking about camera angles,

1556
01:11:18,675 --> 01:11:21,335
and you know, what the
directors choices for making.

1557
01:11:21,338 --> 01:11:22,868
You didn't have to
time in those movies.

1558
01:11:22,869 --> 01:11:25,029
You were just getting
too scared, you know?

1559
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:27,521
Plus I was raised a Catholic,
and it hit a nerve, you know?

1560
01:11:32,218 --> 01:11:43,028
[MUSIC]

1561
01:11:43,029 --> 01:11:44,689
-I'm into tattoos.

1562
01:11:44,691 --> 01:11:46,411
But yeah, I have
a lot of friends

1563
01:11:46,413 --> 01:11:49,883
who get a whole series
from a horror movie.

1564
01:11:49,876 --> 01:11:51,116
Like a full sleeve.

1565
01:11:51,117 --> 01:11:52,437
-Halloween's my
favorite holiday,

1566
01:11:52,439 --> 01:11:54,779
so a lot of the tattoos
are based on that.

1567
01:11:54,781 --> 01:11:56,691
Like this whole sleeve
is like Halloween- based,

1568
01:11:56,693 --> 01:11:58,723
but there's like a
little kid right here,

1569
01:11:58,715 --> 01:12:00,115
and he's got like dream
clouds around him,

1570
01:12:00,116 --> 01:12:02,296
so it's basically all supposed
to be like a nightmare.

1571
01:12:02,298 --> 01:12:04,958
On this arm, I've got a couple
of Vincent Price portraits

1572
01:12:04,961 --> 01:12:09,241
holding a portrait of me as a
kid zombie with my brains out.

1573
01:12:09,235 --> 01:12:12,335
-I like to refer to my
look as horror punk.

1574
01:12:12,339 --> 01:12:14,429
A lot of people call me goth.

1575
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:17,711
My tattoos -- my favorite
one being my Elvira.

1576
01:12:17,714 --> 01:12:19,524
And then I have
my interpretation

1577
01:12:19,516 --> 01:12:22,056
of Gage and Church
from "Pet Cemetary."

1578
01:12:22,058 --> 01:12:28,148
And then, this is just my own
design of just a Halloween.

1579
01:12:28,154 --> 01:12:30,294
-I m on my neck I'm gonna
have two zombie hands

1580
01:12:30,286 --> 01:12:32,326
eventually, like
tearing my throat open.

1581
01:12:32,328 --> 01:12:34,568
-People get horror tattoos
because it's something

1582
01:12:34,571 --> 01:12:39,361
that's easily relateable They
can relates to the monsters

1583
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:44,025
themselves, and they
have -- it's great art.

1584
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:46,840
Depending on whether you're
doing a realistic tattoo

1585
01:12:46,843 --> 01:12:52,873
or not, it's pretty much -- you
take the portrait of the actual

1586
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:55,429
tattoo, and you take a picture
and then you make a stencil

1587
01:12:55,432 --> 01:12:57,022
from that, and lay
it on the person

1588
01:12:57,023 --> 01:13:00,113
so it's directly the same thing.

1589
01:13:00,106 --> 01:13:04,286
Unless you're doing a custom
drawing of the tattoo, and then

1590
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:06,030
you're making a
stencil for that.

DOUG BRADLEY: The loyalty of
horror fans is staggering.

1593
01:13:37,403 --> 01:13:42,003
-Attracts a highly
intelligent fan base

1594
01:13:41,998 --> 01:13:44,158
who are willing to
do the research work.

1595
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,680
You know, drama fans are
or even action fans are.

1596
01:13:46,683 --> 01:13:47,583
They're willing to do it.

1597
01:13:47,584 --> 01:13:49,694
They're fiercely loyal.

1598
01:13:49,686 --> 01:13:53,426
Underestimate them
at your peril.

1599
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,899
-People treat you
differently 'cause,

1600
01:13:54,901 --> 01:13:58,401
you know, you can kind
of sense that you're

1601
01:13:58,404 --> 01:14:01,204
like a die hard horror fan,
and then that scares them.

1602
01:14:01,197 --> 01:14:04,727
-People like to be scared
because, I mean, they know

1603
01:14:04,731 --> 01:14:07,071
their lives aren't in danger
when they're in a theater,

1604
01:14:07,073 --> 01:14:09,133
when they're in a
haunted house, you know?

1605
01:14:09,125 --> 01:14:11,335
They freak, but
then they kind of

1606
01:14:11,337 --> 01:14:13,107
laugh about it at the same time.

1607
01:14:13,109 --> 01:14:17,979
-It reflects a whole lot of
what happens to us in real life,

1608
01:14:17,984 --> 01:14:21,744
but it's also a huge
bit of escapism.

1609
01:14:21,738 --> 01:14:24,878
It's more or less the
mystery that scares me.

1610
01:14:24,881 --> 01:14:27,241
If it's something that's
gory and right in my face,

1611
01:14:27,243 --> 01:14:28,263
I can already see it.

1612
01:14:28,264 --> 01:14:28,974
I know what it is.

1613
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:30,365
I know what I'm dealing with.

1614
01:14:30,366 --> 01:14:33,036
When I don't know with --

1615
01:14:33,039 --> 01:14:36,509
-Our idea of horror itself is
deeply based psychological.

1616
01:14:36,513 --> 01:14:39,163
We all have a fight
or flight response.

1617
01:14:39,155 --> 01:14:40,495
-But I think it's
almost therapeutic.

1618
01:14:40,497 --> 01:14:41,367
I really do.

1619
01:14:41,367 --> 01:14:43,857
I mean, I look at
myself and think back --

1620
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:45,980
even in my youth, why
did I watch horror?

1621
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:48,712
I think I had certain
fears of inhibitions,

1622
01:14:48,705 --> 01:14:51,735
and some how, on the screen,
it all played out for me.

1623
01:14:51,738 --> 01:14:54,428
-I think the true
horror for any of us

1624
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:56,880
is the fear we have
within ourselves.

1625
01:14:56,883 --> 01:15:00,453
-The blood and guts stuff,
it's like that's nice,

1626
01:15:00,446 --> 01:15:04,036
but it's not really so
much what is frightening.

1627
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:07,910
What's frightening is not really
understanding what's going on.

1628
01:15:07,914 --> 01:15:09,664
-It became very
tangible and doable.

1629
01:15:09,656 --> 01:15:11,276
I could watch it unfold.

1630
01:15:11,277 --> 01:15:14,557
Problems being solved,
monsters being resolved.

1631
01:15:14,561 --> 01:15:15,791
You know?

1632
01:15:15,792 --> 01:15:16,952
I think it's very, very healthy.

1633
01:15:16,953 --> 01:15:18,533
I really do.

1634
01:15:18,525 --> 01:15:20,975
-And I like good
versus evil, and that's

1635
01:15:20,977 --> 01:15:23,077
what they're all about.
