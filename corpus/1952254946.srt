1
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:19,397
<i>A special smile</i>

2
00:00:19,432 --> 00:00:23,379
<i>A certain touch</i>

3
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:28,226
<i>I never had a love</i>

4
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:31,698
<i>That I loved so much</i>

5
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:35,430
<i>When I look back</i>

6
00:00:35,465 --> 00:00:39,128
<i>You're everywhere</i>

7
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:43,204
<i>Turn the page</i>

8
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:47,136
<i>You were there</i>

9
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,495
<i>My one sure thing</i>

10
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,411
<i>My solid ground</i>

11
00:00:56,856 --> 00:01:00,492
<i>All I ever wanted</i>

12
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:04,030
<i>Was the love we found</i>

13
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:07,801
<i>You came and answered</i>

14
00:01:07,836 --> 00:01:11,555
<i>My every prayer</i>

15
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,429
<i>Turn the page</i>

16
00:01:15,464 --> 00:01:19,268
<i>You were there</i>

17
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,915
<i>Turn the page</i>

18
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,681
<i>You were</i>

19
00:01:26,716 --> 00:01:30,412
<i>There</i>

20
00:01:56,116 --> 00:02:00,109
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hey, watch it, you idiots!

21
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,223
<i>Be careful with those!
They're violins, not bowling balls!</i>

22
00:02:03,258 --> 00:02:05,423
Why so many?

23
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,394
- Boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing...
- Mom?

24
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,361
<i>- What?
- Which box has our toys?</i>

25
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:13,333
What the hell is Lexi doing?
I can't hear the phone!

26
00:02:13,368 --> 00:02:16,469
Yes, I'm still holding.

27
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:19,838
Okay, well, um...

28
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:22,275
Listen, you don't have
to lie to me...

29
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,243
because I know
that he's there.

30
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:29,271
Well, just check under Lana Holden,
Mrs. Lana Holden.

31
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,519
Well... okay, okay, fine.

32
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:38,547
Just tell Lieutenant Demetras that his
wife called again, will you? Please?

33
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:42,527
- And tell him that... Ma! Jeez!
- No!

34
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:45,430
I want you to listen to me now.

35
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:48,535
You can't keep doing this to yourself
or to the boys.

36
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,536
They need their mother now.

37
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,538
You're a beautiful, talented woman.

38
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,842
- You have your whole life ahead of you.
- Ma, if I'm so beautiful...

39
00:02:55,877 --> 00:02:59,579
and talented, tell me
why did Charles leave me?

40
00:02:59,614 --> 00:03:03,249
Because Charles
is a big jerk.

41
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:07,242
Now get dressed.

42
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:49,429
What am I gonna do?

43
00:03:49,464 --> 00:03:53,422
Well...

44
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,836
first you eat breakfast.

45
00:03:56,871 --> 00:04:00,418
A little black coffee.

46
00:04:00,453 --> 00:04:03,966
And then you get a job.

47
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:07,445
Any job.

48
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,548
<i>The boys,
God bless them...</i>

49
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:14,576
They're big eaters.
I can't afford it.

50
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:19,292
Well, he's gonna get
sick of her, Ma.

51
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,025
We'll see.

52
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,795
Well...

53
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,399
in the meantime...

54
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:30,392
get a job.

55
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:44,406
Just wrap,
you're not Picasso.

56
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:49,544
Picasso would have
put the bows on the back of the box.

57
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,660
Brian Turner.

58
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:56,761
Roberta Guaspari.

59
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:00,789
Oh, my gosh. I thought you moved away.

60
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,803
I did. I'm just here
for my mom's birthday.

61
00:05:03,838 --> 00:05:07,071
Oh, that's nice.
That's really...

62
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:11,099
- Uh, that's for my mom.
- Oh, man... Yeah, Turner.

63
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:15,671
Very pretty though.
Oh, go ahead. Go ahead.

64
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:19,819
- Yes, I knew... I heard you
wrote a book, right? - Mm-hmm.

65
00:05:19,854 --> 00:05:22,353
- I didn't read it, though.
- That's okay.

66
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:25,892
Neither did my mom. Looks good
on her coffee table, though.

67
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,433
Thank you very much,
and please come again.

68
00:05:33,468 --> 00:05:35,533
<i>So what are you doing here?</i>

69
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:38,838
I thought you'd be
in Carnegie Hall by now.

70
00:05:38,873 --> 00:05:41,606
It's a long story.

71
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:45,634
<i>So my college professor said
it was too late.</i>

72
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,915
You know? I hadn't had enough training
to be a concert violinist.

73
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:52,336
So I took a degree
in teaching.

74
00:05:52,371 --> 00:05:55,648
I bet you're
a great teacher.

75
00:05:55,683 --> 00:05:58,890
Well, I think I am.
Or I could...

76
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,527
But every time I would
get started on something,

77
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:03,494
Charles would be transferred.

78
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,932
And then I had my kids,
and I took time out to raise them.

79
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:10,368
Then by the time I wanted
to start teaching again,

80
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:14,396
You know, Navy wife.
You can't count on her to stick around.

81
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,533
So I-I-I decided what I would do
is start my own program.

82
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,780
And Charles gave me
the money... to do that.

83
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:26,808
- We were in Greece. I bought 50 violins at this little Greek shop.
- "Fifty"?

84
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:31,680
And I started the program
at this little private school and, uh...

85
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,308
- And then...
- And then your husband ran off with your best friend.

86
00:06:38,343 --> 00:06:42,057
<i>That's right. No, she was not
my best friend. She was a friend.</i>

87
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:46,695
So what are you gonna do? Just wrap
presents and wait till he comes back?

88
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,075
You sound like my mother.

89
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,103
Oh, God. Heaven forbid.

90
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,749
I've met your mother.

91
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,551
You don't look like her, though.

92
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:04,055
You know something?
I've been thinking.

93
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,094
I know this cool lady.
I wrote a piece about her.

94
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:11,896
She runs
this elementary school.

95
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,284
<i>- It's public, but it's alternative.
- Mm-hmm. Hmm.</i>

96
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:18,638
I don't know. I think...
I think you should meet her.

97
00:07:18,673 --> 00:07:20,938
I would love to,
if you don't mind.

98
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:24,966
If it works out, you'd have
to be willing to relocate, though.

99
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:29,004
Hmm. Where is it?

100
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:46,230
<i>Come here!</i>

101
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:49,133
<i>Damn, man!</i>

102
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:52,470
Hey! Do what you're doing, man!

103
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,207
- You trying to kill me?
- Watch it, fool!

104
00:07:54,242 --> 00:07:58,044
Welcome to East Harlem.

105
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:14,093
<i>Aside from half
a term in a private school...</i>

106
00:08:14,128 --> 00:08:16,494
in Greece...

107
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,198
and a year teaching chorus
in Hawaii ten years ago...

108
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:22,066
That's... the Navy.
They move you around.

109
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:26,094
<i>Um... it doesn't look as if you've
had any other teaching experience.</i>

110
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:30,309
Well, not traditional
teaching experience, but I have, um...

111
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:34,302
<i>- Uh, I've given private lessons.
- Oh.</i>

112
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,316
That's not on there. I...

113
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:41,309
I taught my sons.

114
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,956
I'd like to help you,
Mrs. Demetras.

115
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:48,984
Brian spoke highly of you, and I told him
I would consider starting a violin class.

116
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:52,096
<i>But without
the proper qualifications...</i>

117
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:56,124
and without any experience
in inner-city schools...

118
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:00,695
I'm very sorry.

119
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,010
Okay.

120
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,197
Thank you for seeing me.

121
00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:10,349
You're quite welcome.

122
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,757
<i>What I did is change the 8:45 to 9:45...</i>

123
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:38,109
<i>to 8:45 to 9:30...</i>

124
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,978
- Come in.
- Excuse me.

125
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:45,006
<i>- Oh, I didn't mean to interrupt. I wanted you to meet my boys.
- I'm sorry, Janet.</i>

126
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,719
<i>- This is Nick.
- Hi. - Hi.</i>

127
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:48,853
<i>- And Lexi.
- Hi.</i>

128
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:52,223
I'm sorry. Hi. Oh, I'm Roberta
Guaspari-Demetras.

129
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,989
Dennis Rouche, our music
teacher and program coordinator.

130
00:09:56,024 --> 00:09:59,721
Mrs. Demetras, did I not
make myself clear yesterday?

131
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:03,736
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
I just wanted to show you something.

132
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:06,270
Just take a second.
Ready, boys?

133
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:10,298
Are we having a talent show?
I should have brought my tap shoes.

134
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,903
Five, six,
ready, and...

135
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:53,085
Beautiful. Beautiful.

136
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,853
Oh...

137
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,823
- Will you hire her now?
- Oh!

138
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:02,161
<i>Uh... how long
have you boys been playing?</i>

139
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:04,481
- Since I was three.
- And you?

140
00:11:04,516 --> 00:11:06,731
Maybe since I was
three and a half.

141
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:09,168
Your mom must be
a pretty good teacher, huh?

142
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:11,235
<i>She's okay.</i>

143
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,106
Nick... That's right.
You guys wait out there.

144
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:16,907
- Okay, so...
- Mrs. Demetras, if you could...

145
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:20,935
<i>teach our students to play as well
as they do, I-I'd be thrilled, but...</i>

146
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:24,950
I could. Any child can learn
to play the violin.

147
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:27,053
Assuming they have
the discipline.

148
00:11:27,088 --> 00:11:29,086
I would teach them
to have discipline.

149
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:31,390
Mrs. Demetras, a lot of our parents
are struggling...

150
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:33,357
to feed their kids,
to pay the rent.

151
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:35,394
They don't have time
to help them learn violin.

152
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:37,361
Well, they wouldn't have to.
They wouldn't have to.

153
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:41,389
It would be great if they wanted to help,
but these kids are going to be committed.

154
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,271
They would practice on their own, and
they'd help each other in the classroom.

155
00:11:45,306 --> 00:11:48,307
I think I know these students,
Miss Demetras.

156
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:50,241
<i>- Mrs.
- Mrs. Demetras.</i>

157
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:53,077
And I can tell you right now,

158
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:56,315
their attention span
doesn't go past do, re, mi.

159
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,285
Maybe on a good day,
I can get them to fa.

160
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,253
I think you're
underestimating them.

161
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:05,124
<i>They can learn to play
as well as any other kids.</i>

162
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:08,294
- That I'd like to see.
- Well, you will.

163
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:12,176
Or you would... if...

164
00:12:12,211 --> 00:12:16,024
I'll tell you what...

165
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,004
I'll put you down as a sub.

166
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,105
<i>For now.</i>

167
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,874
<i>- Thank you very much.
- But even if it works out,</i>

168
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,479
the board may not let me create
a permanent position for you.

169
00:12:26,514 --> 00:12:28,446
That's okay. Anything is okay.
That's great.

170
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,050
- I have already planned out the whole term.
- Oh, thank you very much.

171
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:32,883
<i>- Yes!
- There is no room for this.</i>

172
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,888
<i>Besides, where are you gonna
find money for violins?</i>

173
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:38,889
Oh, you need violins?

174
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:42,917
I have violins. I have 50 violins.

175
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:48,200
Thank you very much.
Nice to meet you, Mr...

176
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:51,135
- Rouche.
- Rouche. Th-Thank you.

177
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,738
<i>Okay. Lucy?</i>

178
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,909
<i>Hey, let's go get one!
Come on! Come on!</i>

179
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:59,510
I want one!
Give it to me, now!

180
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,246
- Come on, I want one! Come on!
- Please, don't open...

181
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,518
Don't open the cases, okay, everybody?
Don't open the cases.

182
00:13:05,553 --> 00:13:07,218
<i>No guns.</i>

183
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:11,246
Okay, now...
listen to me, please!

184
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,860
<i>- I don't like this one.
- No, no! Please, keep them closed!</i>

185
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:18,496
Stop it, you two.
You two, what did I just say?

186
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:21,967
Stop! No, no, please, don't. Don't.
No, no, no. No, no, no, please.

187
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:24,982
<i>Just put them back
in the case, all right?</i>

188
00:13:25,017 --> 00:13:27,962
Who's plucking?
Who's plucking my violin? Hey!

189
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,142
Please, will you put it back
in the case right now?

190
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:35,170
<i>Good. Okay. So today I'm going
to be dividing you all up...</i>

191
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:39,507
<i>into five different classes.</i>

192
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:50,084
Hello.
Come with me.

193
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:55,190
You're gonna be the first student
who is not in my violin class, okay?

194
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:58,370
<i>I want you to go
to the office right now.</i>

195
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:00,504
Right now.
Out, out, out.

196
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:04,375
Go on, go on, go on.
Out, out.

197
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,403
<i>Who wants to be next?</i>

198
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:13,419
Who wants to be kicked out
of my class?

199
00:14:13,454 --> 00:14:15,519
<i>Are you raising
your hand...</i>

200
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:18,122
<i>- because you want to be kicked out?
- Yeah.</i>

201
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:21,961
- Wh-Why? - I don't want to
learn about no stupid violins.

202
00:14:21,996 --> 00:14:25,596
Man, violin's for wimps.

203
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,365
<i>- Who told you that?
- Nobody.</i>

204
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,352
<i>- I just know.
- What's your name?</i>

205
00:14:30,387 --> 00:14:32,269
<i>- DeSean.
- Well, DeSean...</i>

206
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:36,297
you didn't give me
a good enough reason, so you're staying.

207
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:44,172
Anybody else?

208
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,855
Very nice.
Everybody be quiet.

209
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:53,092
<i>I'm gonna hand out
the violins.</i>

210
00:14:53,127 --> 00:14:55,361
Hey, I play pretty good.

211
00:14:55,396 --> 00:14:57,596
Yeah, see how easy it is?

212
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,235
That's great.
You know what?

213
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,237
In the spring, maybe,
we can have a big concert...

214
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:09,708
- and invite all your families
and the whole school.

215
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,976
Huh?
That would be great.

216
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,346
- What's your name, honey?
- Naeem.

217
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:16,682
Naeem. Okay, you can
sit down, Naeem.

218
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:19,617
You're gonna be
a quarter size.

219
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:23,355
<i>Yeah, and if you guys do exactly
what I tell you, if you listen to me,</i>

220
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,356
you're gonna sound beautiful
in the concert,

221
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:28,460
and you're gonna feel so proud
of yourselves, you know?

222
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:30,361
<i>But if you don't
listen to me,</i>

223
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:33,232
<i>you're gonna sound so bad your own
parents will get sick when they hear you.</i>

224
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,668
They might even throw up.

225
00:15:35,703 --> 00:15:39,661
I'm serious.

226
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,602
<i>- You decent?
- Yeah.</i>

227
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:51,900
- What's this?
- A toast.

228
00:15:51,935 --> 00:15:55,052
- A toast?
- To Roberta...

229
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:59,080
- for making it through the first week.
- Ah.

230
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,628
I'm proud of you.

231
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:08,200
I really appreciate everything
you've done for us. I really do.

232
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:11,971
I swear to you...
I promise, this weekend,

233
00:16:12,006 --> 00:16:14,071
I will start looking
for a place.

234
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:18,110
There's no rush, really.
No rush. It's...

235
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,210
No, you've done enough.

236
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:24,238
You should be writing
and not baby-sitting us.

237
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,090
I've been reading your book.

238
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,372
- I think it's really great. Yeah.
- Oh?

239
00:16:36,407 --> 00:16:39,620
It's really good.
It's such powerful stuff.

240
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,601
Wow.
Yeah?

241
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:48,238
- Yeah.
- Well, thank you.

242
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:52,277
Um, so the next one
is on migrant workers?

243
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:54,979
Yeah.

244
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,833
How do you know how you...
What...

245
00:16:57,868 --> 00:17:00,617
What you're gonna
write about next?

246
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:04,645
- I mean, how do you...
- I just follow my gut.

247
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:09,217
Pay attention to...

248
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,564
what I'm being drawn to.

249
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,566
What...

250
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:19,594
What are you doing?

251
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:33,674
I've been wanting to do that
since Mr. Duvane's orchestra class.

252
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,557
You never noticed me
in that class.

253
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:44,585
Oh, you... You completely ignored me.
You used to drive me wild.

254
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,201
You had like
five different girlfriends.

255
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:53,194
I never had
the one I wanted.

256
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:01,436
That Roberta
isn't around anymore.

257
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:11,579
I don't believe you.

258
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:17,494
- No, I can't... I-I shouldn't.
- Why?

259
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:20,532
- Because the boys are...
- They're sleeping.

260
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:24,525
Yeah.
Oh, man, I'm still married.

261
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:29,097
And what's your husband
doing right now?

262
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,690
Oh, my God.
The boys.

263
00:18:44,725 --> 00:18:47,224
It's okay.

264
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:51,252
They're still sleeping.

265
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,800
Where are you going?

266
00:18:54,835 --> 00:18:58,793
Uh... Texas.

267
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:03,898
What?

268
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,096
What's in Texas?

269
00:19:08,131 --> 00:19:10,347
Farm workers.

270
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:13,752
My research grant?
I just got the call. It came through.

271
00:19:13,787 --> 00:19:15,519
Wow.

272
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,490
I've got some families lined up there,
and then I go on to California.

273
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:21,093
How long
are you gonna be gone?

274
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:24,263
I don't know.
Two, three months.

275
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:27,450
I thought
you would be around.

276
00:19:27,485 --> 00:19:30,602
I... Um...
And last night...

277
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:33,370
Roberta...

278
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:36,291
last night was great,
but what did you think?

279
00:19:36,326 --> 00:19:39,178
We were gonna get married
in the morning?

280
00:19:39,213 --> 00:19:41,778
No, I didn't think that.

281
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:45,806
I just... We just got here,
and I barely even...

282
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,620
I don't even know
where to buy groceries.

283
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:50,654
You're gonna be fine.

284
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,058
You have a job,
a place to stay,

285
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:55,392
your kids have
a school to go to,

286
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:59,420
and there's a D'Agastino's
right around the corner.

287
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,569
What am I doing
right now?

288
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,306
- Rosining the bow.
- Rosining the bow. That's right.

289
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:11,009
And what am I doing when I tighten
this little screw,

290
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:12,976
when I turn it like this?

291
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:15,180
Tightening the horsehair.

292
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,314
Everybody, be quiet.
Naeem?

293
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:21,342
- Tightening the horsehair.
- The horsehair. That's right. Okay, what do we call this?

294
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:24,388
<i>What is this called?</i>

295
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:27,326
<i>Bird was shooting
them threes, man. Bird was...</i>

296
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:30,260
<i>- DeSean? DeSean?
- Yeah.</i>

297
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,796
<i>- What is this called?
- I don't know.</i>

298
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:34,731
<i>- Yes, you do. Why not?
- I wasn't here.</i>

299
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:38,570
You were here, but you weren't paying attention.
You want people to think you're stupid?

300
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:41,605
<i>Okay, you can tell him, Naeem.</i>

301
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,010
<i>- It's called the frog.
- It's called the frog. That's right.</i>

302
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:47,678
Okay, anybody remember
what this is?

303
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,449
Lucy, do you like it when people snap
their fingers when you talk?

304
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:54,442
Yeah.

305
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,486
<i>"D," "D," "D," "D."</i>

306
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:59,958
<i>"E," "E," "E," "E."</i>

307
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:02,878
"D," "D," "D," "D."

308
00:21:02,913 --> 00:21:05,473
<i>"C," "C," "C," "C,"</i>

309
00:21:05,508 --> 00:21:08,122
"D," "D," "D," "D."

310
00:21:08,157 --> 00:21:10,581
"E," "E," "E," "E."

311
00:21:10,616 --> 00:21:12,970
"D," "D," "D," "D."

312
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,005
<i>Excuse me.</i>

313
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,241
<i>- I'm sorry.
- No talking!</i>

314
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:21,269
- I was supposed to collect kids
from Miss Cooper's classroom...

315
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,716
for my 10:00 class,
and there's nobody there.

316
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:27,784
Miss Cooper's students
have Phys Ed on Tuesdays.

317
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:29,653
<i>But you scheduled them for violin.</i>

318
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:33,558
You must have read
the schedule wrong.

319
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:36,760
I don't think so.

320
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:40,788
Well, I can't solve this problem
for you right now.

321
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,968
I'm trying to teach.

322
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,639
So am I.

323
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:54,611
May we continue, please?

324
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,747
<i>"C," "C," "C"...</i>

325
00:21:56,782 --> 00:22:00,118
- But I thought all the teachers agreed to this.
- In theory.

326
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:03,121
Adam, I want to see you
in my office after lunch.

327
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:05,088
- What did I do?
- Think about it.

328
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:07,592
Look, whenever you pull
the students out, it's a disruption.

329
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:09,559
Plus, it's extra work
on the teachers...

330
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:11,962
because they have to fill
the kids in on what they missed.

331
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,000
- Some of the teachers resent it.
- But can't you talk to them?

332
00:22:15,035 --> 00:22:18,582
Look, I pulled this
off a second-grader this morning.

333
00:22:18,617 --> 00:22:22,129
I'll help you, Roberta,
but I cannot hold your hand.

334
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:28,013
I want everybody to put
your right foot on a tile,

335
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:30,080
and then you put
your left foot on a line.

336
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:33,717
See? Because we're trying
to make a box with our feet.

337
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:37,745
- Lucy, do you want to leave
the class right now?

338
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:41,858
Yeah, because I'm trying
to make you stand strong. See?

339
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:45,886
So strong and balanced that if I tried
to push you over, I couldn't do it.

340
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:48,598
- See?
- Michael Jordan’s pretty good, though.

341
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,635
If you were standing strong,
I couldn't push you...

342
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:54,628
Hey, DeSean. Hey, James.
Now, cut it out.

343
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,875
Anybody seen Naeem?

344
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:02,447
- I saw him this morning, but he's not here.
- I know he's not here.

345
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:05,467
That's why I asked you. See?

346
00:23:05,502 --> 00:23:08,418
Okay, good.

347
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,754
<i>You're not standing strong.</i>

348
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:14,782
See? See how I could push you?
That's because your feet are not...

349
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:19,062
centered.

350
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:22,999
<i>Somebody bring me
a chair, okay?</i>

351
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:27,027
<i>Guadalupe, I think it would be
a good idea for you to sit, okay?</i>

352
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,033
Thank you, DeSean.

353
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,649
Now, who can I yell at?

354
00:23:37,684 --> 00:23:39,983
Hey, Naeem!

355
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:42,853
Where were you today?

356
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,190
I can't be involved
in class anymore.

357
00:23:45,225 --> 00:23:47,492
<i>- Why not?
- My mother won't let me.</i>

358
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:50,494
Why?

359
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:54,499
My son's got more important things
to do than learn dead white men's music.

360
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:57,736
They're gonna learn
"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."

361
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:00,890
How many black classical
composers can you name?

362
00:24:00,925 --> 00:24:03,901
How many black classical
violinists do you know?

363
00:24:03,936 --> 00:24:06,742
That doesn't mean
that's the way it should be.

364
00:24:06,777 --> 00:24:09,246
I mean, Naeem's learning
how to play music.

365
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,681
Maybe it makes him
feel good about himself.

366
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:13,885
<i>- What does it matter who wrote it?
- Please, Ma.</i>

367
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,853
Can I be in the class?

368
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:19,689
Look, I've seen this before.

369
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:23,595
You white women come up here and think you
can rescue our poor inner-city children...

370
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,097
who never asked to be rescued
in the first place.

371
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:28,099
No thank you.

372
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:32,092
Come on.

373
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:36,864
Don't look back at her.
Turn your head around.

374
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:46,879
Shit.

375
00:24:46,914 --> 00:24:49,877
Hello?

376
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,896
Where are you?

377
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:03,735
Are you still with her?

378
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,106
Oh, God.

379
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,242
<i>We've all
missed you so much.</i>

380
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:16,270
<i>The boys and me... We're gonna be
so happy when you come back.</i>

381
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:20,608
<i>I promise it will be better.
I... I...</i>

382
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:24,120
<i>What?</i>

383
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:27,893
<i>Well... What? I thought you said
that you and Lana...</i>

384
00:25:27,928 --> 00:25:31,728
<i>You were...
That was all over.</i>

385
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:35,756
<i>Charles? Charles?</i>

386
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,747
Mm-hmm.

387
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:52,967
Yeah, that was it, you know?

388
00:25:53,002 --> 00:25:55,529
No explanation.
No discussion.

389
00:25:55,564 --> 00:25:58,021
No... anything.
He just...

390
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:01,224
He basically didn't even want
to talk about it.

391
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:05,230
- Just "I want a divorce. Good-bye."
- I know it's hard.

392
00:26:05,265 --> 00:26:07,197
You're gonna
get through this.

393
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,699
You will.
You'll survive this. You will.

394
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:13,271
I'm gonna take the boys
and move back to my mom's.

395
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:15,572
What?

396
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:19,600
You're gonna quit teaching
in the middle of the term?

397
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:22,746
Well, I just...
I don't fit in there.

398
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:25,183
I'm not making any progress
with those kids.

399
00:26:25,218 --> 00:26:27,217
What are you gonna tell Janet?

400
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:31,245
Huh? Your husband left you,
nothing else matters?

401
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:37,151
I don't know.

402
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,671
<i>My mother gave it to me.</i>

403
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:50,842
- Why would she give you $50?
- To buy breakfast.

404
00:26:50,877 --> 00:26:53,643
<i>Do you know how hard
your mother works?</i>

405
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,745
- Yeah.
- Do you think it's right to steal from her?

406
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,184
- I didn't.
- Why don't we go to my office and call her and ask her?

407
00:26:59,219 --> 00:27:01,186
- Come on.
- I need to talk to you.

408
00:27:01,221 --> 00:27:03,687
It will have to wait.

409
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:07,715
- It's important.
- Take a number.

410
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:20,939
Guadalupe,
what are you doing here?

411
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:22,973
I can't keep
my bow straight.

412
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:27,001
Well, honey, your teacher
must be looking for you.

413
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:35,442
Here.
I can't come anymore.

414
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,922
It's too hard.

415
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:41,960
The violin is hard
for everybody.

416
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:44,963
But everyone
is better than me.

417
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:48,956
I'll always be...
weaker.

418
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:54,738
Did you ever hear
of Itzhak Perlman?

419
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:58,766
- No.
- He's one of the greatest violinists in the whole world.

420
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,913
He has problems
with his legs too.

421
00:28:01,948 --> 00:28:04,381
He has to use
two canes to walk,

422
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:07,784
but he still makes
the most beautiful music.

423
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,855
- And he sits down when he plays?
- Yeah, he has to.

424
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:14,824
He was your student?

425
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:18,852
No, but if he were, I would tell him
the same thing I'm telling you.

426
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:26,727
You shouldn't quit something
just 'cause it's hard.

427
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:31,999
But I can't stand strong.

428
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:41,775
Standing strong doesn't mean
just using your legs.

429
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:47,459
You can stand strong
on the inside.

430
00:28:47,494 --> 00:28:51,452
You know what I mean?

431
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,851
- Hi. Want to sit?
- Mm-mm.

432
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:18,879
<i>- That's the sub I was talking about.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

433
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,026
What's the matter, you got
cooties or something?

434
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:24,994
Oh, apparently.

435
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:28,894
Well, I'll take my chances.
Isabel Vasquez, second grade.

436
00:29:28,929 --> 00:29:32,760
- Hi, I'm Roberta Guaspari.
- The violin teacher. I know.

437
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:37,006
Is it my imagination
or does everybody here hate me?

438
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,409
Look, it's hard to fit in when
you're doing a special program.

439
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:43,437
People figure you're not gonna be here
long, so they don't make the effort.

440
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:47,185
It may take a while for folks
to warm up, but they don't hate you.

441
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,053
What about Alice Cooper?

442
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:54,081
<i>- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- A: She thinks the violin is a waste of time.</i>

443
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:59,887
She's a bitch.

444
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:05,403
So why are you
being so nice to me?

445
00:30:05,438 --> 00:30:08,037
Ulterior motives.

446
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:10,408
I want my daughter
in your class next year.

447
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,612
If I'm here next year.

448
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:18,605
You will be.

449
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:25,456
<i>Is just for you and your boys?</i>

450
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:31,060
Yes.

451
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:34,098
No husband?
No boyfriends?

452
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:37,101
No. No.

453
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:43,230
<i>I'll-I'll take it.</i>

454
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:53,941
Slow bows. Slow bows.
Don't squeeze.

455
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:00,013
<i>Oh, man. Stop.
Everybody, stop, stop, stop.</i>

456
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,992
DeSean, how much have you
practiced this week?

457
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,980
My asthma... It was very bad.
I had to go to the hospital.

458
00:31:06,015 --> 00:31:08,933
Again? You told me you had
to go to the hospital last week.

459
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:11,970
Oh, yeah.
Maybe it was last week.

460
00:31:12,005 --> 00:31:14,571
Uh-huh.

461
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:18,409
What about you, Lucy? You sounded
the worst of all. Have you practiced?

462
00:31:18,444 --> 00:31:20,343
<i>- No.
- Why not?</i>

463
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,081
You can't be in this class
if you do not practice.

464
00:31:23,116 --> 00:31:26,082
My grandma got mugged.

465
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:30,088
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is she okay?

466
00:31:30,123 --> 00:31:34,081
She died.

467
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,353
Oh... Lucy, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

468
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,493
Just do the best you can,
okay?

469
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:54,344
<i>- Good night, Roberta.
- Hey... good night.</i>

470
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:57,515
- See you tomorrow.
- You ready? All right, we'll see you.

471
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:01,508
Let's go.

472
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:14,430
- Hey, Naeem.
- Hi, Roberta.

473
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:17,400
Hey, can I talk
to your mama for a second?

474
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:21,428
I just wanted to tell you that I didn't
come up here to rescue anybody.

475
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:24,540
I'm a single mother,
and I needed the job.

476
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:28,568
And I know you think you're protecting
your son, but you're not.

477
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:32,650
I mean, what if Arthur Ashe's
mother said he couldn't play tennis...

478
00:32:32,685 --> 00:32:35,051
because it's
a white man's game?

479
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:37,522
<i>You know, the important
thing is Naeem.</i>

480
00:32:37,557 --> 00:32:39,622
When he plays music,

481
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:43,650
his whole face lights up.

482
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:51,091
You should see that.

483
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:22,700
What's up?

484
00:33:22,735 --> 00:33:24,968
You are.

485
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,996
I was thirsty.

486
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,244
<i>Remember in Greece
we could see the ocean?</i>

487
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,379
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

488
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:40,407
- And the fishing boats and...
- And the octopuses.

489
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:43,486
Yeah.

490
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:47,514
Um, is Daddy
coming here soon?

491
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:56,656
Well... that's something...

492
00:33:57,101 --> 00:34:01,094
I was wanting
to talk to you about.

493
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:08,201
Daddy isn't gonna live
with us anymore.

494
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:14,341
Um... you and Lexi
are gonna see him;

495
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,213
special times like Christmas and,
you know, summers.

496
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:27,354
Um... can you tell
a birthday story?

497
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,235
Don't you want to talk
about what I just said?

498
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:35,228
I want to hear
the birthday story.

499
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,042
Okay.

500
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,478
Um...

501
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:45,649
You know, it was
your grandpa's birthday,

502
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:48,887
and I was a little
bit sad because...

503
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:51,723
because he had died
a couple months back.

504
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:54,525
- But you knew I'd be born that day.
- Yeah.

505
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,627
So I packed,
and I got ready.

506
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:01,655
- Then Daddy left.
- Daddy left, yeah.

507
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:05,336
He didn't believe me because I said,
"This is my dad's birthday.

508
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:07,870
This baby
is gonna be born today."

509
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,908
But he didn't believe you,
but I was born...

510
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:13,911
- You sure were.
- On the same day as Grandpa.

511
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:15,878
That's right.

512
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:19,906
It was a happy day.

513
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,486
Was Daddy happy too?

514
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:24,720
Of course he was.

515
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:28,748
Then why is he leaving me?

516
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,896
Well, he's not
leaving you, Nick.

517
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:37,924
I mean, he loves you,
and he loves Lexi very, very much.

518
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:43,363
Then why
can't he live with us?

519
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:51,771
It's just sometimes things
h-happen between...

520
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:56,643
Grown-ups...

521
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,922
that are very hard
to understand.

522
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:03,950
They can't...
They just can't be together.

523
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,779
- I need to buy some...
- Mommy, come look!

524
00:36:21,814 --> 00:36:23,746
What?

525
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:27,351
What are you...
Oh, my God, you're killing me.

526
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:29,452
- What's this?
- A dog.

527
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:33,289
- What is this?
- Mom, look, look at her. She's so cute.

528
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:36,325
<i>- Right? Can we get her?
- No. We're not getting a dog, no.</i>

529
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,764
<i>- She could stay with us. No, you don't have to...
- No, but... Yeah, but...</i>

530
00:36:39,799 --> 00:36:42,331
Okay.

531
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:46,359
Now we're all gonna take turns
cleaning up after this puppy, right?

532
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:51,198
Uh, absolutely.

533
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:55,936
Yeah, right.

534
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:00,284
You're on the wrong string,
Becky.

535
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:02,653
<i>I've only told you
this 14 times.</i>

536
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:05,188
Look at your nails.

537
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:11,429
You're supposed to cut them
for violin... I've told you th...

538
00:37:11,464 --> 00:37:13,796
That sounds terrible!

539
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:15,965
<i>You're gonna make
your parents sick.</i>

540
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,136
Is this
an important question, Tanisha?

541
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:22,238
- What?
- Do you have two of those skirts?

542
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:26,266
- Huh?
- You wore one just like that on Monday.

543
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:30,370
- All right, I don't think that's
such an important question.

544
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:34,674
<i>Let's try it again.</i>

545
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:43,049
Okay, just practice
on the fingerboards silently.

546
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:53,293
Naeem and I were wondering
if he could still be in the class?

547
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:00,934
Well, I would love that.

548
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:03,279
You've got a lot
of catching up to do.

549
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:06,882
- You think you can work that hard?
- Yeah, I can.

550
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:10,910
Okay. But I can also arrange for
some private lessons at my apartment.

551
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,758
I wouldn't be able
to afford that.

552
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:16,692
That's okay.

553
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:19,363
Why don't you go get a spare violin
and see if you can remember...

554
00:38:19,398 --> 00:38:23,356
how to set it up.

555
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:31,364
Okay, let's try it again, shall we?

556
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:34,343
- Yes.
- Come on out, Naeem.

557
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:38,371
See if you can remember
how to do that. All right.

558
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,651
- You're shouting at them all the time!
- I'm not shouting all the time!

559
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:42,618
Just when
they don't listen.

560
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:46,568
- They have to listen to me.
- Didn't you tell them they were making their parents sick?

561
00:38:46,603 --> 00:38:50,483
<i>I did say... But I didn't say it
exactly that way.</i>

562
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:55,355
I'm raising Becky
in a supportive atmosphere.

563
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,602
<i>- I don't send her to school to be abused.
- I'm trying to teach discipline.</i>

564
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:01,337
<i>That's all. If you want to take
a very difficult instrument,</i>

565
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:04,875
you have to take it seriously, you have
to focus, you have to pay attention...

566
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:08,868
<i>I think what Mrs. Lamb
is trying to say, Roberta,</i>

567
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:12,848
is that you are
a little too harsh,

568
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:16,876
but I'm sure you might be able
to soften your comments to the children.

569
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:22,893
<i>I don't believe we have an impossible
situation here, now do you?</i>

570
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:25,963
Mm-mm. No, that's...
I can do that.

571
00:39:25,998 --> 00:39:27,631
Good.

572
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:47,084
<i>Okay, that's enough.
Thank you.</i>

573
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:58,084
Well, that was...
pretty good.

574
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,996
<i>That was...
not so bad.</i>

575
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:04,568
It wasn't?
I thought we stunk.

576
00:40:04,603 --> 00:40:06,569
Well...

577
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:08,571
<i>I wouldn't
put it that way.</i>

578
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,841
I would just say
that some people...

579
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:13,973
could maybe practice
a little bit more.

580
00:40:14,008 --> 00:40:17,070
James, did you practice
at all this week?

581
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:21,841
Okay, well, perhaps you could try
a little harder for next week, okay?

582
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,873
<i>Good. Because all you got
to do is your best.</i>

583
00:40:25,908 --> 00:40:28,759
<i>Roberta, why are you
acting like that?</i>

584
00:40:28,794 --> 00:40:32,128
- Like what?
- Like nice.

585
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:35,164
<i>- Well, don't you want a nice teacher?
- I already got nice teachers.</i>

586
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:39,192
- You added some variety.
- Yeah, we like you better the way you used to be.

587
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:49,969
I agree. This is even worse.
You're acting weird now.

588
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:57,110
Okay, I take it all back.

589
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:00,456
You stunk!
You all stunk!

590
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:04,484
<i>- Don't tell your parents
that I said that, okay?</i>

591
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:06,962
- Okay.
- Let's do it again.

592
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:09,765
<i>Right this time.
Stand up straight.</i>

593
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,803
<i>Make the box with your feet.
Come on, tabletops up.</i>

594
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:14,772
<i>Stop sign. Beautiful.
Let's go.</i>

595
00:41:14,807 --> 00:41:17,870
Five, six, seven, and...

596
00:41:17,905 --> 00:41:20,934
Tempo, tempo, tempo!

597
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,250
<i>Don't open the presents,
all right, on the airplane.</i>

598
00:41:26,285 --> 00:41:29,698
It's time to board.
Time to go.

599
00:41:29,733 --> 00:41:33,112
Okay, gotta go.
Hugs, hugs, hugs.

600
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:36,525
I'll take good care of them.

601
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,697
- Can't you come with us, please?
- Oh, baby, I told you.

602
00:41:39,732 --> 00:41:43,690
This is Daddy's
special time with you.

603
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:52,765
Bye.

604
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:58,238
Bye, Nick!

605
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:25,932
<i>Oh, Tom Sawyer
is drying out too.</i>

606
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:30,781
You should read the new book
Mark Twain's writing now.

607
00:42:30,816 --> 00:42:33,782
How did you happen
to fall in?

608
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:36,620
<i>- I didn't fall in.
I jumped in to save George.</i>

609
00:42:36,655 --> 00:42:40,222
What? To save me?

610
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:43,561
- Who is it?
- You didn't go through with it, did you?

611
00:42:43,596 --> 00:42:45,628
- Through with what?
- Suicide.

612
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:49,656
<i>- It's against the law
to commit suicide around here.</i>

613
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:57,341
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!

614
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:03,646
<i>- Oh!
- Merry Christmas!</i>

615
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:07,016
- I'm back.
- You're back. Oh, God.

616
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:10,154
<i>- Hut, hut, hike! - I
gotcha, I gotcha! - I'm open!</i>

617
00:43:10,189 --> 00:43:14,147
<i>Touchdown!</i>

618
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:17,211
- First down and ten now!
- Okay.

619
00:43:17,246 --> 00:43:20,062
That's it.
Enough goofing off.

620
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,631
- Back to work, everybody.
- Hey, no fair.

621
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:25,836
- Everybody.
- What are you trying to do, kill me?

622
00:43:25,871 --> 00:43:28,938
<i>You're wearing me out.</i>

623
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:32,207
- I'll wear you out.
- You already did that last night.

624
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:36,235
The only one in the entire coffee shop
not speaking Spanish. Boys, lunch.

625
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:42,775
<i>Oh, my... Gunshots. You hear that?</i>

626
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,955
How you gonna live here
by yourself?

627
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:47,222
That's a truck backfire, Ma.

628
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:51,250
I work in this neighborhood,
and I want to live here too.

629
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:54,898
<i>Say hello
to the next-door neighbor, Assunta.</i>

630
00:43:54,933 --> 00:43:57,766
<i>He won't bite.</i>

631
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,570
- What's your name?
- Lawrence.

632
00:44:00,605 --> 00:44:03,305
- Are you hungry, Lawrence?
- Yes.

633
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,076
<i>Do you want half of mine,
and I'll have half of yours?</i>

634
00:44:06,111 --> 00:44:08,978
<i>- Okay?
- Lawrence?</i>

635
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:12,781
- Come sit with us.
- Hey, get in here.

636
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:16,619
<i>- Why did you let her buy this house?
- "Let her"?</i>

637
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,956
Your daughter does what she wants,
in case you haven't noticed.

638
00:44:18,991 --> 00:44:22,949
I noticed.

639
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:27,297
- I just don't understand the rush.
- I want my own home.

640
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:30,801
I've been living on Navy bases
since the day I got married.

641
00:44:30,836 --> 00:44:33,037
The boys don't have a dad.
They can have a home.

642
00:44:33,072 --> 00:44:35,239
But if you invested
your divorce settlement,

643
00:44:35,274 --> 00:44:37,773
you could buy
a nice house someday.

644
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:43,147
Bad enough you're living
in this neighborhood.

645
00:44:43,182 --> 00:44:47,140
Please stop, okay?

646
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:58,490
I'm sorry. I am.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

647
00:44:58,525 --> 00:45:02,155
Forgive me. I love you.

648
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,700
Don't worry.
It's gonna be okay.

649
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:08,303
Things keep
going as well as they have been,

650
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:12,331
- eventually, I'm sure,
Brian will move in with me.

651
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:14,945
And how much do you know
about that man?

652
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,312
He's a good person,
you know?

653
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:20,017
He's...
He's been a big help to me.

654
00:45:20,052 --> 00:45:22,718
<i>He's great
with the boys.</i>

655
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:26,746
Just don't want you to make
the same mistake twice, Roberta.

656
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:30,043
You barely knew Charles,
and you married him.

657
00:45:30,078 --> 00:45:32,194
I don't believe this!
I don't believe it!

658
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,231
You're ragging on me for buying
the house in this neighborhood.

659
00:45:34,266 --> 00:45:36,834
I would think you would want
Brian to move in with me!

660
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:39,236
Not if he's
the wrong person!

661
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:07,164
Okay, everybody look alive.
We're coming up to the fermata.

662
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:09,550
Here it comes.
Nobody move.

663
00:46:09,585 --> 00:46:11,844
Hold, hold,
hold, hold, hold.

664
00:46:11,879 --> 00:46:14,069
Now at the spring concert,

665
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,507
the audience is going to be
dying for this next note,

666
00:46:16,542 --> 00:46:19,908
but we're gonna make 'em wait.

667
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:23,212
And wait and wait
and wait and wait.

668
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:26,049
You wait here. I'm gonna
go get a cup of coffee.

669
00:46:26,084 --> 00:46:28,350
- Roberta!
- Good-bye.

670
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:31,186
Roberta!

671
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:33,789
All right, all right, all right,
all right, all right!

672
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:37,494
But you gotta remember, you gotta
all come in together. Promise me.

673
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:51,264
- Man, we'll never get that right.
- That's not a very nice thing to say about your classmates.

674
00:46:51,408 --> 00:46:55,401
How many people think we can
get it right by the concert?

675
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:05,289
See?
I think we can. Have faith, DeSean.

676
00:47:05,324 --> 00:47:07,456
<i>It'll be all right.</i>

677
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:11,061
<i>All right.
Practice makes perfect.</i>

678
00:47:11,096 --> 00:47:13,128
Can I go upstairs?

679
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:16,565
Yeah, go see if you
can find your room.

680
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:20,593
<i>- Careful, there's no railing... yet.
- All right.</i>

681
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:25,140
- Hey, Ernie.
- Hey.

682
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:29,179
- How's it going?
- If I could just remember what I did here yesterday,

683
00:47:29,214 --> 00:47:31,814
I could be moving a whole lot faster.

684
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:35,519
- You look real pretty today, honey.
- Thanks.

685
00:47:35,554 --> 00:47:37,953
Roberta, honey...

686
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:40,355
have you lost your mind?

687
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:44,226
<i>Wait, what is that?</i>

688
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:48,254
- That's Sheetrock.
- Why does it have wallpaper all over it?

689
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:52,291
- That's how it comes.
- Wait a minute. What do they call that?

690
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:54,636
Sheetrock.

691
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:58,442
- And why...
- That's the way it comes now.

692
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:03,579
Roberta,
you've got to be kidding me.

693
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:07,017
These ex-cons you've hired
ripped this off,

694
00:48:07,052 --> 00:48:08,984
just like
they're ripping you off.

695
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:12,623
I have spent every single
penny of my settlement on this house.

696
00:48:12,658 --> 00:48:15,026
I don't have the bucks, okay,

697
00:48:15,061 --> 00:48:17,795
to hire fancy union workers.

698
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:20,530
Okay, fine.
Do it your way.

699
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:24,523
As usual.

700
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,709
- Fight, fight!
- Oh, my God!

701
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:37,179
- Okay, boys...
- Come on, kids. Break it up.

702
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:40,284
- Calm down. What's wrong with you?
- Nick, come on!

703
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:44,277
Hey.

704
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:55,497
I'm putting him
on two-day suspension,

705
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:58,702
- but next time he will be expelled.
- There will not be a "next time."

706
00:48:58,737 --> 00:49:01,003
I promise you that.

707
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:03,538
Have you noticed
your son lately?

708
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:06,310
He's tied up in knots,
and he's asking for help.

709
00:49:06,345 --> 00:49:10,303
Kids fight.
You're making too much of this.

710
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:19,690
He was choking
the kid, Roberta.

711
00:49:19,725 --> 00:49:21,957
Nick is in trouble,

712
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:25,985
and you need
to deal with it.

713
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:35,728
Hey, Lexi, catch!

714
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:38,974
<i>Oh, no, no!</i>

715
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,310
<i>- Oh, no!
- I'm sorry.</i>

716
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:43,347
- Come here.
- I didn't mean it. The wind took it.

717
00:49:43,382 --> 00:49:45,981
- Come here.
- No, I don't have enough power!

718
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:49,451
- No! Help me!
- You're gonna get it.

719
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:53,479
- Are you a duck or a chicken?
- I'm a chicken!

720
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:56,158
You're a chicken?

721
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:58,195
- Careful!
- You got yourself a chicken.

722
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:01,098
I'm a chicken!

723
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:12,131
You're the only one
that can make Nick laugh nowadays.

724
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:16,669
He just misses his dad.
I'm just a fill-in.

725
00:50:16,813 --> 00:50:20,806
No, I don't think so.
I think he really, really likes you.

726
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,554
- Huh.
- We're all hopin'...

727
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:29,426
you'll move into the new house
with us, you know.

728
00:50:29,461 --> 00:50:32,661
Whoa.
Slow down here a minute.

729
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:35,699
- That's a little too much
like getting married.

730
00:50:35,734 --> 00:50:38,100
He's sweating.

731
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:40,535
What's so bad
about that?

732
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:43,440
How do you know that in five years
we'll even like each other?

733
00:50:43,475 --> 00:50:46,576
- Oh, well, you know, maybe we won't.
- Yeah.

734
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:48,712
But if two people care
about each other,

735
00:50:48,747 --> 00:50:51,113
you know,
they take a chance.

736
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:53,815
Yeah, like you and Charles
took a chance.

737
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:57,843
I'm not talking about Charles,
I'm talking about us.

738
00:50:58,155 --> 00:51:01,423
Roberta, look, marriage...

739
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:05,295
It's based on a belief that one person
can completely meet another's needs.

740
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,562
Now, I just...
I don't buy that.

741
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:09,733
- Whoa, wait, wait a minute.
- I never have.

742
00:51:09,768 --> 00:51:11,952
What are you saying?

743
00:51:11,987 --> 00:51:14,102
Are you saying that...

744
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:16,638
if you have some needs
that I don't meet,

745
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:19,776
you would go and have them
met by somebody else?

746
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:26,539
I'm saying it's a fantasy to think
about marriage lasting these days.

747
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:31,121
One out of two marriages
ends in misery and divorce.

748
00:51:31,156 --> 00:51:33,290
No, no, no, you're not
answering my question.

749
00:51:33,325 --> 00:51:35,657
What is your question?

750
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:38,794
If I don't meet
all of your needs,

751
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:40,796
you know, and we're
in a committed relationship...

752
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:44,701
I'm not talking about marriage.
I'm just talking about a relationship.

753
00:51:44,736 --> 00:51:48,438
You would go
to somebody else?

754
00:51:48,473 --> 00:51:52,442
In theory... yes.

755
00:51:52,477 --> 00:51:54,409
"In theory"?

756
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,446
Wait a second.
Wait, wait.

757
00:51:56,481 --> 00:51:58,713
Wh-What happened here?

758
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:00,749
Weren't we having
a nice time?

759
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:04,488
Yeah, okay. Have we been having
a great time together?

760
00:52:04,523 --> 00:52:07,089
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

761
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:11,117
So let's just keep it
that way, all right?

762
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:14,865
Or not.

763
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,635
Let's go!
Come on!

764
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:24,663
Let's go home!
We're all going home.

765
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:29,301
<i>- Why can't he?
- Because he just can't.</i>

766
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,433
Brian is at his house
tonight.

767
00:52:33,468 --> 00:52:35,517
We are at ours.

768
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:38,155
- Then I want to go to his house.
- That's enough, Nick.

769
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:40,122
Come on.

770
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:43,727
Will you please just set up your violin
and start practicing while I make supper.

771
00:52:43,762 --> 00:52:46,196
Why don't you see if the puppy left
us a little present in the bathroom?

772
00:52:46,231 --> 00:52:48,530
I don't feel like practicing!

773
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:52,558
I don't care.
Just go do it, now. Go. Go.

774
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:55,203
I want to go to Brian's!

775
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:57,806
<i>Stop whining...</i>

776
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:01,834
and go practice
the violin.

777
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:08,240
Get your violin.

778
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,525
Man.

779
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:24,957
- What the hell do you
think you're doing?

780
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:27,704
The problem with you is
you're mean to everybody,

781
00:53:27,739 --> 00:53:30,872
and then they don't want
to be with you!

782
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:34,242
I've had just
about enough of you, young man.

783
00:53:34,277 --> 00:53:38,270
You just set up that violin properly
and start practicing right...

784
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:42,408
I hate the violin!

785
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,786
Pick up that bow right now.

786
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:48,256
Don't you ever, ever
throw down your bo...

787
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:51,595
<i>It's all your fault!
You made Daddy leave us!</i>

788
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:52,994
<i>Now you're gonna make
Brian leave us!</i>

789
00:53:53,029 --> 00:53:56,266
You're gonna be all alone,
and I'll have to take care of you!

790
00:53:56,301 --> 00:54:00,259
You don't have to...
take care of me.

791
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:05,464
- Then who's going to?
- I can take care of myself.

792
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:10,703
And I can take care of you
and Lexi. I promise.

793
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:15,402
You didn't try hard enough.

794
00:54:15,437 --> 00:54:18,822
You made Daddy leave us.

795
00:54:18,857 --> 00:54:22,815
That isn't true.

796
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:27,386
And that is not fair.

797
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:31,690
I begged him not to leave us,
but he wouldn't listen to me.

798
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:36,273
- Why not?
- Because he found somebody else...

799
00:54:36,308 --> 00:54:39,909
that he likes more...
than me.

800
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:43,478
Who?

801
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:46,748
Lana.

802
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:50,776
Remember Lana and Tom,
our friends in Greece?

803
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:53,923
That's her.

804
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:03,422
Is he gonna marry her now?

805
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:12,998
No, honey.

806
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:17,069
<i>But he's not...</i>

807
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:23,108
He's not ever coming back...
to me.

808
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:30,392
Come here, Lex.
Come here, baby.

809
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:33,880
I'm... I'm gonna
take care of you, Nick.

810
00:55:33,915 --> 00:55:36,942
And I'm gonna take care
of your brother.

811
00:55:36,977 --> 00:55:39,969
And we're still a family.
Come here, baby.

812
00:55:40,004 --> 00:55:43,268
I'm never gonna go anywhere.

813
00:55:43,303 --> 00:55:46,532
Okay?
You don't have to worry.

814
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:56,453
Hey. Hey!

815
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:34,089
<i>- Hey.
- What?</i>

816
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:37,092
- What color is that?
- White.

817
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:41,120
- No, I told you eggshell.
- Eggshells are white.

818
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:45,924
Women.

819
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:49,003
<i>Roberta...</i>

820
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:51,005
how many times
I tell you...

821
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,576
you can't be
your own contractor?

822
00:56:53,611 --> 00:56:55,543
You're an idiot.

823
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:59,571
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
I am an idiot.

824
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:03,118
<i>Hey! Ernie!</i>

825
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:05,939
Ernie, wake up. Come on, come on.

826
00:57:05,974 --> 00:57:08,725
I'm sorry,
but you are fired.

827
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,612
You're fired.
Yeah. Go.

828
00:57:11,647 --> 00:57:14,429
You two...
You're fired.

829
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:17,031
- Out. Get out.
- Is she kidding?

830
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:21,059
<i>- You're kidding, right?
- I want you out of my house! Go!</i>

831
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,976
You're fired too.

832
00:57:27,011 --> 00:57:30,747
Take it! Go!

833
00:57:30,782 --> 00:57:33,148
Yeah.

834
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:37,176
- Yeah, that's more like it.
- You're fired too.

835
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:40,455
What?

836
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:43,059
I mean it.
I mean... I mean it.

837
00:57:43,094 --> 00:57:45,429
I need to be with a man,
you know,

838
00:57:45,464 --> 00:57:48,610
who can make
a commitment to me.

839
00:57:48,645 --> 00:57:51,757
I need that,
and my boys need that.

840
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:57,896
Can you do that?

841
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:05,576
Roberta...

842
00:58:05,611 --> 00:58:09,107
Get out!

843
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:14,958
All right.

844
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,530
All right.

845
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:31,901
Whew! That was great.

846
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:24,186
<i>All right!</i>

847
01:00:24,221 --> 01:00:27,690
Bravo!

848
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:35,087
<i>All right!</i>

849
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:44,262
<i>Yeah!</i>

850
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:06,427
<i>Children, today
is a very special day...</i>

851
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:10,455
<i>because we're starting the tenth year
of the East Harlem Violin Program.</i>

852
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:15,661
Now, some of you might know that I used
to teach just 50 kids at this school.

853
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:19,207
But now I teach
150 kids...

854
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:22,143
<i>at three different
East Harlem schools.</i>

855
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:26,171
So many children want to take this violin
class that we have to have a lottery.

856
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:29,684
<i>Now this is a wonderful opportunity,</i>

857
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:33,712
so I want you to talk to your parents about
whether or not you would like to try this.

858
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:38,050
My daughter took violin with Roberta
when she was your age.

859
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:42,721
Now she's in high school, and she
still talks about how much she loved it.

860
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:46,868
Janet and I
started this program...

861
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:50,896
because we knew how much you kids
could benefit from it.

862
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:55,901
<i>You should know, however,
the violin...</i>

863
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:58,281
is a difficult instrument.

864
01:01:58,316 --> 01:02:00,448
So I...
What is it, Justin?

865
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:03,269
<i>- Who's that lady in the back?
- Oh, excuse me.</i>

866
01:02:03,304 --> 01:02:06,020
Yes, this is
Dorothea Von Hauften, and she...

867
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,289
<i>- What kind of name is that?
- Justin, shh.</i>

868
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:11,143
<i>She's taking pictures
of Roberta's classes...</i>

869
01:02:11,178 --> 01:02:13,928
for a magazine article
on music education.

870
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:16,499
<i>- I want to be in a magazine.
- First things first, Justin.</i>

871
01:02:16,534 --> 01:02:19,067
Roberta's going to explain to us
about the lottery.

872
01:02:19,102 --> 01:02:22,171
What we're gonna do is, you're going
to bring in your permission slips.

873
01:02:22,206 --> 01:02:24,691
<i>Have your parents sign them.
You bring them in.</i>

874
01:02:24,726 --> 01:02:27,947
I'm gonna take a hat.
I'm gonna close my eyes...

875
01:02:27,982 --> 01:02:31,169
and I'm gonna pick just 50 names
from each school...

876
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:34,016
'cause there isn't enough room
for everybody else.

877
01:02:34,051 --> 01:02:38,009
<i>So, on Friday,
bring in the slips,</i>

878
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:41,022
<i>and we will tell you
who gets to be...</i>

879
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:45,038
<i>- in the violin class.
Yeah, but everybody gets a chance.</i>

880
01:02:45,073 --> 01:02:49,020
- Yes?
- I really, really hope that I get in the class.

881
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:53,169
<i>I really hope you do too.</i>

882
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:29,361
Wait, Lex, what time is it?
- 2:20.

883
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:33,899
<i>- I got to go.
- Nick, Lexi, how come you guys don't play the violin?</i>

884
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:38,548
We used to, but you know
how my mom is as a teacher?

885
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:43,186
Picture her being your teacher
and your mother.

886
01:03:43,221 --> 01:03:45,787
<i>- Oh, I'm sorry I'm so late.
- Hi, Mom.</i>

887
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,558
<i>- Hi, Rachel. - Hi. -
Hey, Allegra, come here.</i>

888
01:03:48,593 --> 01:03:50,458
Nick, are you
finished practicing?

889
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,593
<i>- Yeah, I'm done.
- Already?</i>

890
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:55,965
<i>- You hardly even practiced.
- What, are you timing me with a stopwatch?</i>

891
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,866
- Why don't you pick on Lexi for a change?
- 'Cause I'm perfect.

892
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:01,971
<i>- 'Cause he's perfect.
Yeah, but your head hurts, right?</i>

893
01:04:02,006 --> 01:04:04,972
- Have a good lesson, Rachel.
- Thanks.

894
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:08,911
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to meet Lawrence, play some basketball.

895
01:04:08,946 --> 01:04:11,347
- I'll be back in a couple of hours.
- Okay.

896
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:30,222
Don't forget the vibrato.

897
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:34,101
Dang,
I just can't get that right.

898
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:36,138
Well, that's almost it.
You almost got it.

899
01:04:36,173 --> 01:04:38,306
Almost isn't good enough.

900
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:42,334
Ooh, did I turn you
into such a perfectionist?

901
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:46,214
No, I came that way.

902
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:48,216
That's what I thought.

903
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:52,244
Well, just as long as you get it...
for your Juilliard audition.

904
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:56,023
What?

905
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:59,095
I've recommended you
for a gifted kids scholarship.

906
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:01,062
Really?

907
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:04,216
I think you can do it.

908
01:05:04,251 --> 01:05:06,978
And the next is...

909
01:05:07,013 --> 01:05:09,670
Shandra Wilson.

910
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:13,474
<i>- Yes!
- Congratulations.</i>

911
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:17,513
- All right, Shandra! Good for you.
- Congratulations, sweetie.

912
01:05:17,548 --> 01:05:21,506
- All right. Next is Justin Brady.
- Yes!

913
01:05:23,185 --> 01:05:25,219
Yeah.

914
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:27,321
- Yes!
- Here you go.

915
01:05:27,356 --> 01:05:30,359
- Next one is... Could be you.
- Look at this, Ramon.

916
01:05:30,394 --> 01:05:34,352
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Vanessa Klein.</i>

917
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:39,491
Vanessa, good for you, honey.
Wow, such a good class.

918
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:41,602
<i>And the very last one, okay?</i>

919
01:05:41,637 --> 01:05:45,630
And that is Ramon Olivas.

920
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:50,168
All right, Ramon.
Good for you. Oh, my gosh.

921
01:06:03,669 --> 01:06:06,138
<i>- Thank you!
- Yea!</i>

922
01:06:06,173 --> 01:06:08,572
<i>I got it!</i>

923
01:06:08,607 --> 01:06:12,600
I got it!

924
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:31,363
Does that really work,
the ticket thing?

925
01:06:31,398 --> 01:06:33,330
- Oh. Oh, hello.
- Hello.

926
01:06:33,365 --> 01:06:36,600
No, that doesn't work,
but I keep trying.

927
01:06:36,635 --> 01:06:39,571
You know, maybe one day, the school
will give me a parking space.

928
01:06:39,606 --> 01:06:42,603
- Oh.
- That would be nice.

929
01:06:42,638 --> 01:06:45,600
- Here. Photographs.
- Oh!

930
01:06:47,045 --> 01:06:51,038
Oh, no!
They're fantastic!

931
01:06:52,517 --> 01:06:55,603
<i>Those copies are for you.
- Oh, thank you so much!</i>

932
01:06:55,638 --> 01:06:58,655
Oh, they're great!
Oh, can I pay you for them?

933
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:01,860
Oh, don't be silly. You'll need
your money for parking tickets.

934
01:07:01,895 --> 01:07:05,495
Oh, thank you so much!
That's fantastic!

935
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:08,699
I think what you're doing
for these children... It's wonderful.

936
01:07:08,734 --> 01:07:12,727
My husband's a violinist. He was very
impressed when I told him about you.

937
01:07:12,804 --> 01:07:16,797
- Oh, really? What's his name?
- Arnold Steinhardt.

938
01:07:17,576 --> 01:07:21,569
- Of the Guarneri String Quartet?
- Yeah. Oh, here.

939
01:07:22,581 --> 01:07:25,550
Stay in touch. Let us know
when the kids have a concert.

940
01:07:25,585 --> 01:07:27,851
I will, I will.
Oh, thank you.

941
01:07:27,886 --> 01:07:30,355
Thank you so much.
That's really...

942
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:32,824
<i>- Here.
- That's... Oh, gosh.</i>

943
01:07:32,859 --> 01:07:36,260
- Keys. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

944
01:07:36,295 --> 01:07:39,529
Very good! Okay, now when you
take your violins home,

945
01:07:39,564 --> 01:07:43,557
I'm gonna ask you to put your music... Tape it
up on the wall directly in front of your nose.

946
01:07:45,337 --> 01:07:49,319
'Cause you don't want to be bending over
like this, trying to read your music.

947
01:07:49,354 --> 01:07:53,301
<i>- Your parents are gonna be so excited to see you... play.
- Stop!</i>

948
01:07:56,848 --> 01:08:00,018
Yeah, okay.
Let's try it again.

949
01:08:00,053 --> 01:08:03,455
<i>Ready?
And...</i>

950
01:08:06,558 --> 01:08:10,551
Ramon, how many cats
you killing back there?

951
01:08:24,710 --> 01:08:28,703
Ready and...

952
01:08:30,649 --> 01:08:34,642
Myesha, your stop sign
should be touching, honey.

953
01:08:35,354 --> 01:08:38,622
<i>Don't let it wiggle around
like that.</i>

954
01:08:38,657 --> 01:08:42,459
<i>Justin, you're on the wrong string.</i>

955
01:08:42,494 --> 01:08:45,163
<i>Look at your feet.
All right, hold it, hold it, hold it.</i>

956
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:47,064
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. What time...

957
01:08:47,099 --> 01:08:51,092
- Vanessa, where is your violin?
- I forgot it.

958
01:08:51,503 --> 01:08:54,438
Again?

959
01:08:54,473 --> 01:08:56,725
This is...
Good-bye.

960
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:58,942
<i>Go on. Good-bye.</i>

961
01:08:58,977 --> 01:09:01,546
I'm sorry, but, you know,
you may be dropped.

962
01:09:01,581 --> 01:09:04,481
<i>Go!</i>

963
01:09:04,516 --> 01:09:08,151
Hey, Ramon, that's very much better.
I have to tell you, I'm very impressed.

964
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:12,179
<i>- That practicing is paying off.
Let me see your nails, Rosario.</i>

965
01:09:12,624 --> 01:09:16,617
See? You gotta keep these clipped.
And I'm looking at you too, Myesha.

966
01:09:16,828 --> 01:09:19,197
- Everybody, I've told you...
- Drop dead, Justin!

967
01:09:19,232 --> 01:09:21,798
- It was an accident.
- It was not!

968
01:09:21,833 --> 01:09:24,836
Hey, Ramon, I don't like that kind of
talk in here! You pick that stand up now.

969
01:09:24,871 --> 01:09:26,737
You get the music.
Come on.

970
01:09:26,772 --> 01:09:30,765
Listen to me, buddy. We have a big concert
coming up. You're not gonna be in it maybe.

971
01:09:32,511 --> 01:09:36,504
<i>- Is that what you want?
- No.</i>

972
01:09:36,748 --> 01:09:40,741
<i>- Ooh.
- Nothing funny here.</i>

973
01:09:41,653 --> 01:09:44,421
<i>- Here you go, sweetheart.
Come on, I got it.</i>

974
01:09:44,456 --> 01:09:46,523
<i>- Good night. - Bye-bye.
Work hard. - Get inside.</i>

975
01:09:46,558 --> 01:09:48,860
That a girl. We just got...
We're in a hurry, that's all.

976
01:09:48,895 --> 01:09:50,827
- Mr. Klein?
- Yeah?

977
01:09:50,862 --> 01:09:54,855
You know, I'm gonna have to drop Vanessa
from class if she keeps forgetting her violin.

978
01:09:56,968 --> 01:09:59,069
Hey, look...

979
01:09:59,104 --> 01:10:02,641
she's going back and forth
between houses.

980
01:10:02,676 --> 01:10:06,634
My wife and I split up.

981
01:10:06,845 --> 01:10:09,713
Oh. I'm sorry.

982
01:10:09,748 --> 01:10:12,751
Vanessa, why don't you write down
for your mom and dad...

983
01:10:12,786 --> 01:10:16,744
<i>which days are violin days,
okay?</i>

984
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:28,665
Relax your two, Simon.
Good.

985
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:32,693
Kenny, your stop sign should be up.
Up, up, up, up. That's better.

986
01:10:33,205 --> 01:10:37,198
<i>Stephanie, you look like you never had a
violin lesson with me in your entire life!</i>

987
01:10:39,511 --> 01:10:41,478
Oh, Carlos.
Where's your violin?

988
01:10:41,513 --> 01:10:44,983
- Um... it's coming.
- What's it, walking here by itself?

989
01:10:45,018 --> 01:10:48,518
<i>- I'm coming!
- Thank you.</i>

990
01:10:48,553 --> 01:10:52,489
- Your buddies giving you a hard time?
- Look, it's just not cool.

991
01:10:52,524 --> 01:10:55,543
<i>- You wouldn't understand.
- You want your sister to carry your violin, that's fine.</i>

992
01:10:55,578 --> 01:10:58,563
But is she practicing for you too? Because
that's the way it sounds to me lately.

993
01:10:58,598 --> 01:11:00,530
- I've been busy.
- I don't want to hear it.

994
01:11:00,565 --> 01:11:02,601
Get here on time and commit to
this class or I don't want you in here.

995
01:11:02,636 --> 01:11:04,803
<i>You understand me?
Go.</i>

996
01:11:04,838 --> 01:11:08,796
<i>Go.</i>

997
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,981
You're a good violinist,
Carlos,

998
01:11:18,016 --> 01:11:21,152
but it is definitely not cool
to waste your talent.

999
01:11:21,187 --> 01:11:24,087
<i>- Okay?
- Yeah.</i>

1000
01:11:24,122 --> 01:11:27,993
<i>So, let's do it again.
Perfect this time.</i>

1001
01:11:30,228 --> 01:11:34,221
Hi.

1002
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:39,693
Hey...

1003
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:49,803
What happened?

1004
01:11:54,986 --> 01:11:58,979
- I guess you've all heard the bad news about Justin.
- I didn't hear.

1005
01:12:00,358 --> 01:12:03,789
<i>There was a drive-by
shooting by his house,</i>

1006
01:12:03,824 --> 01:12:07,221
and he got shot by accident
and he died.

1007
01:12:14,139 --> 01:12:18,132
Would anybody like
to talk about this now?

1008
01:12:29,788 --> 01:12:31,755
Ramon?

1009
01:12:31,790 --> 01:12:35,783
I think we should
just play violin.

1010
01:13:00,318 --> 01:13:04,311
- Roberta, come in.
- I just wanted to stop by and check on Ramon.

1011
01:13:05,690 --> 01:13:09,683
- Why?
- Didn't he tell you what happened at school today?

1012
01:13:23,441 --> 01:13:27,434
- Hey, Roberta wants to talk to you, okay?
- Okay.

1013
01:13:42,327 --> 01:13:45,230
- Did that sound okay?
- That sounded very good.

1014
01:13:45,265 --> 01:13:49,223
Very good.

1015
01:13:52,237 --> 01:13:54,239
I've been thinking
about Justin.

1016
01:13:56,241 --> 01:13:59,978
Remember how mad I was
at him the last time I saw him?

1017
01:14:00,013 --> 01:14:03,446
Yeah. You got
really strict with him.

1018
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:07,474
Yeah, but, you know, it wasn't
always easy to be nice to him.

1019
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:12,312
You think Justin’s
in heaven or hell?

1020
01:14:13,124 --> 01:14:17,117
Heaven.

1021
01:14:18,196 --> 01:14:20,230
I told him to drop dead.

1022
01:14:20,265 --> 01:14:24,258
Well, Justin didn't die
because you said that.

1023
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:28,304
<i>- I promise.
- How would you know?</i>

1024
01:14:28,339 --> 01:14:32,332
Well, I don't think
you're that powerful. You know?

1025
01:14:34,079 --> 01:14:36,246
<i>If you had such powers,</i>

1026
01:14:36,281 --> 01:14:39,818
<i>just imagine what kind of
a violinist you'd be by now.</i>

1027
01:14:39,853 --> 01:14:43,811
Yeah, I'd be better than you.

1028
01:14:51,129 --> 01:14:53,815
It's okay to cry.

1029
01:14:53,850 --> 01:14:56,610
Not for a man.

1030
01:14:56,645 --> 01:14:59,335
My boys still cry,

1031
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:03,363
and they're big, strong
young men now.

1032
01:15:03,508 --> 01:15:06,377
And I'll bet Justin’s
daddy cried.

1033
01:15:15,754 --> 01:15:19,747
It's okay.

1034
01:15:30,135 --> 01:15:32,470
What's this?

1035
01:15:36,541 --> 01:15:40,534
Oh. What is all this?

1036
01:15:49,854 --> 01:15:52,791
What is this?

1037
01:15:58,229 --> 01:16:02,222
I...

1038
01:16:02,834 --> 01:16:06,827
Nick! Lexi!
You come down here right now!

1039
01:16:09,107 --> 01:16:13,100
<i>Mom, we were just trying to help.</i>

1040
01:16:13,144 --> 01:16:15,845
This is so humiliating.

1041
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:18,181
No one even knows
it's you.

1042
01:16:18,216 --> 01:16:20,919
I mean, you don't even have to
read them, if you don't want to.

1043
01:16:20,954 --> 01:16:23,419
Although, look, obviously,

1044
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:25,855
a lot of guys are interested
in dating you.

1045
01:16:25,890 --> 01:16:29,883
No, a lot of guys are interested
in dating you and Lexi.

1046
01:16:32,230 --> 01:16:34,833
What did you say
about me anyway?

1047
01:16:34,868 --> 01:16:37,867
Beautiful musician,

1048
01:16:37,902 --> 01:16:40,136
late thirties,
tired of playing solo...

1049
01:16:40,171 --> 01:16:44,164
Seeks a healthy, stable, attractive man
who's not afraid of a duet...

1050
01:16:44,442 --> 01:16:46,910
<i>with a strong, independent woman.</i>

1051
01:16:46,945 --> 01:16:49,212
My violin playing
will feed your soul.

1052
01:16:49,247 --> 01:16:51,349
<i>And my lasagna will be music
to your palette.</i>

1053
01:16:51,384 --> 01:16:53,316
Oh, my God!

1054
01:16:53,351 --> 01:16:56,352
Did you catch
all the music metaphors?

1055
01:16:56,387 --> 01:16:59,924
Oh, no. Listen, don't you think
it's a little weird...

1056
01:16:59,959 --> 01:17:02,094
that you're trying
to get your mother a date?

1057
01:17:02,129 --> 01:17:04,194
And don't hit him again
or I'll smack you.

1058
01:17:04,229 --> 01:17:07,198
Don't you think it's a little weird that
you're not even interested in dating?

1059
01:17:07,233 --> 01:17:11,102
Look, even if I were
interested in dating,

1060
01:17:11,137 --> 01:17:14,070
which... which I'm not,

1061
01:17:14,105 --> 01:17:17,408
I don't have time to do that,
and, besides, you know,

1062
01:17:17,443 --> 01:17:21,401
<i>I have my teaching...
which I love.</i>

1063
01:17:21,579 --> 01:17:25,572
I have you...
and you.

1064
01:17:26,417 --> 01:17:30,410
That's all I need.

1065
01:17:31,356 --> 01:17:35,349
<i>- I really thought she'd
like the music metaphors.</i>

1066
01:17:35,493 --> 01:17:39,486
She said don't hit me.

1067
01:17:43,501 --> 01:17:47,494
God.

1068
01:17:55,013 --> 01:17:59,006
"Dan Paxton."

1069
01:18:04,389 --> 01:18:07,425
That's good.
That's good.

1070
01:18:10,962 --> 01:18:12,362
<i>You're flat, Nick.</i>

1071
01:18:12,397 --> 01:18:15,098
- I'm not flat, Mom.
- Sounds flat to me.

1072
01:18:15,133 --> 01:18:19,126
Play the violin.
I'll take care of the cello, okay?

1073
01:18:23,141 --> 01:18:25,376
So, you nervous, Mom?

1074
01:18:25,411 --> 01:18:29,369
No.

1075
01:18:36,554 --> 01:18:40,547
I'm... I'm just...
I'll be right back. I just...

1076
01:18:41,192 --> 01:18:45,185
Let him in.

1077
01:18:50,301 --> 01:18:54,294
Hi. I'm Dan Paxton.

1078
01:18:54,472 --> 01:18:56,439
- Is this the right place?
- Yeah.

1079
01:18:56,474 --> 01:18:58,474
- Roberta, right?
- Yeah. I'm her son, Lexi.

1080
01:18:58,509 --> 01:19:02,502
- Oh, hi, Lexi. Nice to meet you.
- You can go in the living room.

1081
01:19:06,351 --> 01:19:08,551
- Hi.
- Nick.

1082
01:19:08,586 --> 01:19:11,672
- Uh, Dan.
- Dan, nice to meet you.

1083
01:19:11,707 --> 01:19:14,724
- This is Allegra and...
- Hi. Oh, hey.

1084
01:19:14,759 --> 01:19:18,752
She should be...
She should be out in a minute.

1085
01:19:19,097 --> 01:19:23,090
<i>Hi.</i>

1086
01:19:25,203 --> 01:19:27,537
- Dan?
- Yeah.

1087
01:19:27,572 --> 01:19:30,641
- Hi, I'm Roberta.
- Wow. An honest woman.

1088
01:19:30,676 --> 01:19:33,076
- "Honest"?
- Your ad.

1089
01:19:33,111 --> 01:19:37,104
You said you were a beautiful woman,
and you were telling the truth.

1090
01:19:38,049 --> 01:19:42,042
Oh.

1091
01:19:42,487 --> 01:19:46,480
- We should probably take off... soon.
- Okay, all right.

1092
01:19:46,824 --> 01:19:50,817
I'll get my bag.

1093
01:19:52,230 --> 01:19:56,223
Make sure you're home
by midnight, young lady.

1094
01:19:57,769 --> 01:20:01,671
- He's like six four.
- I know.

1095
01:20:01,706 --> 01:20:04,308
<i>To the right. To the right.</i>

1096
01:20:07,045 --> 01:20:09,479
<i>That's the car. They're here.</i>

1097
01:20:09,514 --> 01:20:12,083
<i>- All right.
- Oh, Mommy's late.</i>

1098
01:20:12,118 --> 01:20:14,617
- What time is it anyway?
- 12:30.

1099
01:20:14,652 --> 01:20:17,120
<i>- That's promising.
- Ten bucks says he tries to kiss her.</i>

1100
01:20:17,155 --> 01:20:20,525
That's a no-brainer. Of course, he'll try.
The real question is whether she lets him.

1101
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,528
- Okay, ten bucks she lets him.
- You're on.

1102
01:20:23,563 --> 01:20:26,197
Well, I had a good time
tonight.

1103
01:20:26,232 --> 01:20:30,190
Yeah, I did too.
I, uh...

1104
01:20:31,169 --> 01:20:33,171
I have a confession
to make though.

1105
01:20:33,206 --> 01:20:35,671
Uh...

1106
01:20:35,706 --> 01:20:37,840
Uh, I've...

1107
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:40,545
I've never answered
an ad before.

1108
01:20:40,580 --> 01:20:44,538
Uh, I lost a poker bet.

1109
01:20:44,615 --> 01:20:48,608
No.

1110
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:52,188
But I'm glad I did.
But I...

1111
01:20:52,223 --> 01:20:55,458
I have a little confession
myself.

1112
01:20:55,493 --> 01:20:59,486
My boys placed the ad behind my back.

1113
01:21:00,798 --> 01:21:03,199
<i>- You're kidding.
- No.</i>

1114
01:21:03,234 --> 01:21:05,201
<i>- I had a great time.
- No. Really?</i>

1115
01:21:05,236 --> 01:21:08,706
Yeah, they did this.
They're so worried I have no...

1116
01:21:08,741 --> 01:21:11,441
social life.

1117
01:21:11,476 --> 01:21:14,479
- Ten dollars.
- No way, man. She ain't gonna kiss him.

1118
01:21:14,514 --> 01:21:18,472
- Just watch.
- Shut up.

1119
01:21:24,822 --> 01:21:27,457
Dan, I just...
I want to tell...

1120
01:21:27,492 --> 01:21:31,485
I went along with this because
it's been a while for me.

1121
01:21:32,563 --> 01:21:34,849
<i>It's been quite a while.</i>

1122
01:21:34,884 --> 01:21:37,100
But, um, I'm not sure...

1123
01:21:37,135 --> 01:21:40,738
I really want to get involved
with anybody just yet.

1124
01:21:40,773 --> 01:21:44,275
Does this mean
I don't get any lasagna?

1125
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:47,529
Oh, yeah.

1126
01:21:47,564 --> 01:21:50,713
<i>Bye.</i>

1127
01:21:50,748 --> 01:21:52,715
Oh, my God!

1128
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:56,554
- Jesus, what are you guys doing up?
- Sorry.

1129
01:21:56,589 --> 01:21:58,521
Why, is it late?

1130
01:21:58,556 --> 01:22:02,527
- How was it, Mom?
- It was nice, you know.

1131
01:22:02,562 --> 01:22:04,494
- "Nice"?
- Yeah.

1132
01:22:04,529 --> 01:22:06,597
What, as in like
"Let's just be friends" nice?

1133
01:22:06,632 --> 01:22:09,734
Well, you know,
I don't know.

1134
01:22:09,769 --> 01:22:12,802
But we'll see.

1135
01:22:12,837 --> 01:22:15,606
- You know, there's a lot more letters.
- Good night, Nick.

1136
01:22:15,641 --> 01:22:17,608
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, baby.

1137
01:22:17,643 --> 01:22:19,742
Good night, Mom.

1138
01:22:19,777 --> 01:22:21,744
That's right.
Pay up.

1139
01:22:21,779 --> 01:22:25,772
Mom, could you
loan me ten dollars?

1140
01:22:34,959 --> 01:22:38,690
Hi. Kids, I'm sorry I'm late.

1141
01:22:38,725 --> 01:22:42,422
I got stuck over at C.P.E. 2.

1142
01:22:42,733 --> 01:22:46,726
Where are your violins?

1143
01:22:54,245 --> 01:22:57,715
- What's the matter?
- We heard you got fired.

1144
01:22:57,750 --> 01:23:01,708
You what?

1145
01:23:03,454 --> 01:23:07,447
<i>They don't want music anymore.</i>

1146
01:23:14,332 --> 01:23:16,299
Is it true?

1147
01:23:16,334 --> 01:23:19,470
- Come into the office, Roberta.
- It's true? You're firing me?

1148
01:23:19,505 --> 01:23:22,440
It wasn't me, Roberta.
The Board of Ed cut the budget.

1149
01:23:22,475 --> 01:23:24,640
The district had to comply.

1150
01:23:24,675 --> 01:23:28,412
As of the end of this term,
the violin program has been excessed.

1151
01:23:28,447 --> 01:23:30,446
"Excessed"?

1152
01:23:30,481 --> 01:23:33,449
They specifically said
that my violin program has to go?

1153
01:23:33,484 --> 01:23:36,520
They slashed the budget! Music and
art programs got hit the worst.

1154
01:23:36,555 --> 01:23:39,557
- Yeah, what about Dennis's classes?
- Uh, I'm tenured, Roberta.

1155
01:23:39,592 --> 01:23:41,457
Yeah. When was this
decided anyway?

1156
01:23:41,492 --> 01:23:44,712
Things happened very quickly.
I wanted to tell you myself.

1157
01:23:44,747 --> 01:23:47,897
- I can't believe this is happening!
- Why not? You are a sub.

1158
01:23:47,932 --> 01:23:51,901
<i>- Your position has never been permanent.
- Hey, Dennis, just smile!</i>

1159
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:54,472
- This is the happiest day of your life, isn't it?
- Come into the office.

1160
01:23:54,507 --> 01:23:58,488
You are not helping.

1161
01:23:58,523 --> 01:24:02,469
Come on.

1162
01:24:03,347 --> 01:24:06,651
- There must be some way that we can fight this.
- Fight it with what?

1163
01:24:06,686 --> 01:24:10,321
I don't have any other extra programs
I can give them instead.

1164
01:24:10,356 --> 01:24:13,656
I see. I see.

1165
01:24:13,691 --> 01:24:17,295
After ten years, after 1,400 kids
have learned the violin,

1166
01:24:17,330 --> 01:24:19,214
this is just
an "extra program."

1167
01:24:19,249 --> 01:24:21,063
You know I don't
feel that way,

1168
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:23,934
<i>and you know damn well I've been
standing by you all these years!</i>

1169
01:24:23,969 --> 01:24:26,302
You think I haven't noticed
what you've done for these kids?

1170
01:24:26,337 --> 01:24:29,106
- Then do something!
- I have been on this phone for the past three days...

1171
01:24:29,141 --> 01:24:31,440
<i>trying to do something!</i>

1172
01:24:31,475 --> 01:24:34,377
They're sick of hearing my voice!
Believe me...

1173
01:24:34,412 --> 01:24:37,480
there are other people around here
I would much rather get rid of,

1174
01:24:37,515 --> 01:24:41,508
but as far as the board is concerned,
violin classes are not a priority!

1175
01:24:43,421 --> 01:24:47,414
I don't have
the power here, Roberta.

1176
01:24:48,826 --> 01:24:52,129
I am so sorry.

1177
01:26:37,134 --> 01:26:41,127
<i>Please sit.</i>

1178
01:26:43,674 --> 01:26:47,667
This beautiful concert
that you just heard...

1179
01:26:48,679 --> 01:26:50,880
could be
the very last concert...

1180
01:26:50,915 --> 01:26:54,049
<i>of the East Harlem Violin Program.</i>

1181
01:26:54,084 --> 01:26:58,077
<i>The Board of Ed and the district
superintendent think that music...</i>

1182
01:26:58,689 --> 01:27:02,057
isn't important
for our kids.

1183
01:27:02,092 --> 01:27:05,895
<i>But they are wrong,</i>

1184
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:09,567
<i>and they're gonna get a big fight.</i>

1185
01:27:32,089 --> 01:27:34,190
<i>Why do the parents have to meet here?</i>

1186
01:27:34,225 --> 01:27:37,094
<i>- You should be using the vacuum
cleaner, by the way. I got it.</i>

1187
01:27:37,129 --> 01:27:41,087
<i>Oh, God, somebody's early.</i>

1188
01:27:41,699 --> 01:27:45,692
- Hello, Assunta. How are you?
- Well, I'd be a lot better...

1189
01:27:46,570 --> 01:27:49,607
- if my daughter had a job next year.
- Well, so would I.

1190
01:27:49,642 --> 01:27:52,074
- Ma.
Sorry I'm early, but, um...

1191
01:27:52,109 --> 01:27:55,579
I figured we'd need
a little extra time to set up.

1192
01:27:55,614 --> 01:27:59,114
Beware of Greeks
bearing you-know-what.

1193
01:27:59,149 --> 01:28:01,851
Mommy, will you mind taking Allegra
for a walk right now please?

1194
01:28:01,886 --> 01:28:04,955
<i>- You are having a meeting here tonight, right?
Parents and teachers?  - Yes.</i>

1195
01:28:04,990 --> 01:28:07,157
<i>- Get down, get down.
Come on, Allegra. Let's go.</i>

1196
01:28:07,192 --> 01:28:10,259
<i>- Take it from me,
- Good-bye.</i>

1197
01:28:10,294 --> 01:28:12,563
If you want to get parents to help you
with something, you got to feed them.

1198
01:28:12,598 --> 01:28:15,264
<i>Do you have a cutting board for these?</i>

1199
01:28:15,299 --> 01:28:19,292
And if you think
parents are bad, teachers are worse.

1200
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:21,772
Believe me, I know.
I was a teacher.

1201
01:28:21,807 --> 01:28:24,573
That's why I brought snacks.

1202
01:28:24,608 --> 01:28:27,877
- Wow.
- Gets them every time.

1203
01:28:27,912 --> 01:28:31,280
Uh, you didn't expect me
to bring homemade, did you?

1204
01:28:31,315 --> 01:28:35,308
- No, I didn't...
- Good, because my husband begs me to stay out of the kitchen.

1205
01:28:39,723 --> 01:28:43,716
- I didn't expect you to be here at all.
- Why not?

1206
01:28:44,962 --> 01:28:47,965
We got to figure out a way
to fight this.

1207
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,132
And after ten years,
I don't know,

1208
01:28:50,167 --> 01:28:53,571
I just can't imagine walking down
those hallways and not hearing that...

1209
01:28:53,606 --> 01:28:56,307
off-key, nails-on-blackboard
violin music.

1210
01:28:58,943 --> 01:29:02,936
Thank you.

1211
01:29:03,347 --> 01:29:07,340
- Ma. Ma, get some...
- I'll tell you this.

1212
01:29:08,586 --> 01:29:10,553
If this was
a downtown problem,

1213
01:29:10,588 --> 01:29:12,389
they would take care of it tomorrow.

1214
01:29:12,424 --> 01:29:15,124
Absolutely right.

1215
01:29:15,159 --> 01:29:17,061
They don't realize how much
this program helps our kids.

1216
01:29:17,096 --> 01:29:19,948
Simon is our third child
to study with Roberta.

1217
01:29:19,983 --> 01:29:22,765
<i>James is premed.
April is valedictorian.</i>

1218
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,801
<i>- Now that says something.
- Nobody knows that.</i>

1219
01:29:25,836 --> 01:29:28,922
<i>We should inundate the board and the
district with letters. I mean, flood them.</i>

1220
01:29:28,957 --> 01:29:32,009
It doesn't matter how many letters you
send them. It's just not in the budget.

1221
01:29:32,044 --> 01:29:34,778
- What if we raise the money ourselves?
- Oh, they wouldn't object.

1222
01:29:34,813 --> 01:29:37,179
What if you did a benefit concert?

1223
01:29:37,214 --> 01:29:41,150
<i>We could raise a batch of money
from the ticket sales,</i>

1224
01:29:41,185 --> 01:29:44,887
and the concert itself could
be great publicity for the program.

1225
01:29:44,922 --> 01:29:48,915
It can't just be me and the kids, I don't
think, not if you're gonna charge money.

1226
01:29:48,993 --> 01:29:51,393
Perhaps I could persuade Arnold
to play with you and the kids.

1227
01:29:51,428 --> 01:29:55,421
<i>- And, well, maybe he can get
another violinist too.</i>

1228
01:29:56,033 --> 01:29:58,000
Itzhak Perlman, perhaps.

1229
01:29:58,035 --> 01:30:01,005
Itzhak Perlman?
Arnold and... Arnold would do this?

1230
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:03,005
Itzhak Perlman?

1231
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:05,074
And Arnold... Would they
do this, though?

1232
01:30:05,109 --> 01:30:07,142
<i>Yes, Arnold and Itzhak
are very good friends.</i>

1233
01:30:07,177 --> 01:30:09,144
<i>Seriously, you think they would?
- Yes, yes.</i>

1234
01:30:09,179 --> 01:30:13,172
And we could rent a place like the
92nd Street "Y." It's perfect for this.

1235
01:30:13,717 --> 01:30:17,454
- It seats about 900 people.
- Nine hundred would be more than enough.

1236
01:30:17,489 --> 01:30:21,123
And if we charge between
$50 and $100 a ticket, then...

1237
01:30:21,158 --> 01:30:23,493
That could raise you enough
to reinstate your program for a year.

1238
01:30:23,528 --> 01:30:25,794
<i>That's a very... That's a great idea.</i>

1239
01:30:25,829 --> 01:30:28,397
- That's a lot of money, Roberta.
- It'll be fun.

1240
01:30:28,432 --> 01:30:31,367
<i>If you can get us the fellows.</i>

1241
01:30:31,402 --> 01:30:35,395
Beg him. Do whatever
you need to do.

1242
01:30:35,973 --> 01:30:39,966
- Hi.
- Well, I have some good news and some great news.

1243
01:30:40,978 --> 01:30:43,447
We're in five different papers.

1244
01:30:45,883 --> 01:30:49,876
Oh, my... Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1245
01:31:07,237 --> 01:31:10,172
Itzhak, it's Arnold.

1246
01:31:10,207 --> 01:31:12,141
You know,
the other fiddler.

1247
01:31:12,176 --> 01:31:15,913
I have something
to propose to you.

1248
01:31:17,915 --> 01:31:21,179
<i>Let's break all the rules</i>

1249
01:31:21,214 --> 01:31:24,444
<i>Come on, baby
Me and you</i>

1250
01:31:26,724 --> 01:31:30,717
- Thank you.
- Okay, good luck.

1251
01:31:35,332 --> 01:31:38,546
<i>Let's break all the rules</i>

1252
01:31:38,581 --> 01:31:41,761
<i>Come on, baby
Me and you</i>

1253
01:31:58,188 --> 01:32:00,889
Hey!

1254
01:32:00,924 --> 01:32:04,917
Everybody, listen to me.
Pay attention. Fall in.

1255
01:32:05,129 --> 01:32:08,363
<i>You people
are my very best...</i>

1256
01:32:08,398 --> 01:32:11,333
beginning and advanced
violin students,

1257
01:32:11,368 --> 01:32:15,105
and that's why you have been chosen
to be in the Fiddlefest.

1258
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:19,098
Because I trust that
you can handle this pressure.

1259
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:22,746
This is gonna be a lot of work,
a lot, a lot of work!

1260
01:32:22,781 --> 01:32:25,547
<i>People have already
bought tickets to this thing,</i>

1261
01:32:25,582 --> 01:32:28,018
<i>and we are not gonna be here
in the fall if, you know,</i>

1262
01:32:28,053 --> 01:32:30,020
<i>they all run screaming
to the box office...</i>

1263
01:32:30,055 --> 01:32:32,189
and want their money back,
okay?

1264
01:32:32,224 --> 01:32:34,156
So you gotta be good!

1265
01:32:34,191 --> 01:32:36,859
<i>- "Bach's Minuet 1"?
- Yes, that's right.</i>

1266
01:32:36,894 --> 01:32:39,296
Because people are gonna be
paying good money for this concert.

1267
01:32:39,331 --> 01:32:41,296
They don't want
to hear "Twinkle."

1268
01:32:41,331 --> 01:32:45,324
Okay. Now, on the second page of
your music, you will see a contract.

1269
01:32:46,436 --> 01:32:50,239
<i>I need you and I need your parents
to sign that...</i>

1270
01:32:50,274 --> 01:32:54,267
because that promises me you are gonna
be there at each and every rehearsal.

1271
01:32:54,411 --> 01:32:58,180
- Every Saturday and Sunday?
- Every Saturday and Sunday...

1272
01:32:58,215 --> 01:33:01,351
<i>- and nighttime rehearsals
during the week.</i>

1273
01:33:01,386 --> 01:33:03,921
Oh, yes!
We have six weeks, people!

1274
01:33:03,956 --> 01:33:06,421
Six weeks to this concert.
All right?

1275
01:33:06,456 --> 01:33:09,124
That's not enough time.
We can't do it all in school.

1276
01:33:09,159 --> 01:33:12,462
I'm thinking, maybe, we're gonna come
in early before school in the mornings.

1277
01:33:12,497 --> 01:33:16,064
<i>Come in early...</i>

1278
01:33:16,099 --> 01:33:19,536
No, that's what it's gonna take. Have
you ever heard of Navy SEAL training?

1279
01:33:19,571 --> 01:33:22,907
<i>- No.
- Well, this is gonna be Roberta's String Training.</i>

1280
01:33:22,942 --> 01:33:26,243
- It's gonna be tough. It's gonna be rough.
- Hi, Roberta.

1281
01:33:26,278 --> 01:33:29,144
Oh, Naeem! Oh!

1282
01:33:29,179 --> 01:33:31,446
Great!
I'm so glad you came.

1283
01:33:31,481 --> 01:33:34,367
<i>- Roberta!
- Guadalupe, is that you? Oh.</i>

1284
01:33:34,402 --> 01:33:37,219
<i>Oh, I'm good, I'm good.</i>

1285
01:33:37,254 --> 01:33:39,221
Now, I'm grea...
That's not Lucy.

1286
01:33:39,256 --> 01:33:43,249
Oh! Oh, guys, this is so great.

1287
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:46,997
- And DeSean? You're a monster. You're huge!
- How you doing?

1288
01:33:47,032 --> 01:33:50,990
You grew a little.

1289
01:33:51,034 --> 01:33:53,936
You guys,
you grew a little bit.

1290
01:33:53,971 --> 01:33:57,735
Okay, these are four of my... not my
best students, but my first students.

1291
01:33:57,770 --> 01:34:01,500
- They've agreed to come and play
in the concert with you guys.

1292
01:34:03,413 --> 01:34:07,150
I'm trying to tell them how hard
they're gonna have to work. All right?

1293
01:34:07,185 --> 01:34:10,287
<i>Take it from me,
you gotta work your butts off.</i>

1294
01:34:10,322 --> 01:34:14,280
<i>Six weeks to this concert.</i>

1295
01:34:39,182 --> 01:34:41,701
Hey, Carlos, where you going?
We got a game, remember?

1296
01:34:41,736 --> 01:34:44,221
- Yeah, but I can't make it.
- What are you talking about?

1297
01:34:44,256 --> 01:34:46,288
Look, I just can't make it.

1298
01:34:46,323 --> 01:34:50,027
What? Do you have a date
with the violin teacher?

1299
01:34:50,062 --> 01:34:54,020
Yeah, I do.
Give me that.

1300
01:35:04,541 --> 01:35:07,943
More bow!

1301
01:35:07,978 --> 01:35:09,945
Stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop!

1302
01:35:09,980 --> 01:35:13,150
My God, you sound...
Is anybody practicing at all?

1303
01:35:13,185 --> 01:35:16,285
How can we practice?
We're rehearsing all the time.

1304
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:19,688
- Oh, that's funny. You think
that's funny, Stephanie?

1305
01:35:19,723 --> 01:35:23,727
<i>You think the 400 people that have
bought tickets so far are gonna think...</i>

1306
01:35:23,762 --> 01:35:27,720
You think Itzhak Perlman is gonna
think it's funny?

1307
01:35:28,065 --> 01:35:31,335
I'm not trying
to beat you kids up.

1308
01:35:31,370 --> 01:35:33,302
I'm really not.

1309
01:35:33,337 --> 01:35:35,304
But I know two things.

1310
01:35:35,339 --> 01:35:37,572
One: If this program
disappears next year,

1311
01:35:37,607 --> 01:35:41,600
you're gonna look around, and you're
gonna really, really miss it.

1312
01:35:44,081 --> 01:35:48,074
Two: If you have
a hand in saving it,

1313
01:35:49,052 --> 01:35:52,020
<i>each one of you,</i>

1314
01:35:52,055 --> 01:35:54,324
you're gonna feel
real good.

1315
01:35:54,359 --> 01:35:56,325
Real good.

1316
01:35:56,360 --> 01:36:00,353
Boy, that will be better than any lesson
I can teach you in class.

1317
01:36:00,497 --> 01:36:04,490
It's gonna be worth it,
so please hang in there with me.

1318
01:36:06,236 --> 01:36:10,073
Oh, you know, I cannot believe
I ever agreed to do this!

1319
01:36:10,108 --> 01:36:11,773
These kids are never
gonna be ready.

1320
01:36:11,808 --> 01:36:15,545
You should hear the Bach double.
It's a complete disaster.

1321
01:36:15,580 --> 01:36:18,113
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1322
01:36:18,148 --> 01:36:20,484
The good news is the tickets
are selling like hotcakes.

1323
01:36:20,519 --> 01:36:22,786
The bad news is the kids
sound like sh...

1324
01:36:22,821 --> 01:36:26,273
- There's more bad news.
- What?

1325
01:36:26,308 --> 01:36:29,691
- We've lost the "Y."
- What?

1326
01:36:29,726 --> 01:36:31,693
They had a flood.
A water heater burst.

1327
01:36:31,728 --> 01:36:35,132
The concert hall was damaged,
and they've canceled all events.

1328
01:36:35,167 --> 01:36:36,598
Until when?

1329
01:36:36,633 --> 01:36:39,735
<i>- Until further notice.
- Oh, no, no, no.</i>

1330
01:36:39,770 --> 01:36:43,407
This can't happen. We've sold tickets.
We've done publicity.

1331
01:36:43,442 --> 01:36:46,041
We have a concert
in three weeks.

1332
01:36:46,076 --> 01:36:49,413
I've been on the phone
all morning calling other theaters.

1333
01:36:49,448 --> 01:36:53,406
<i>Nothing's available.</i>

1334
01:37:08,165 --> 01:37:11,566
<i>- Come on.
- The teacher's late.</i>

1335
01:37:11,601 --> 01:37:15,404
You know, I think she should
be dropped, don't you?

1336
01:37:15,439 --> 01:37:19,432
- Yeah, I don't know if we should let her play in Fiddlefest.
- Yeah.

1337
01:37:34,191 --> 01:37:37,744
Check it out.
Here you go, youngster.

1338
01:37:37,779 --> 01:37:41,263
<i>- Yeah.
- Hey, somebody gave us money!</i>

1339
01:37:41,298 --> 01:37:44,835
Stop. No, hold it.
Are you guys kidding me?

1340
01:37:44,870 --> 01:37:47,204
<i>You have
to have more bow.</i>

1341
01:37:47,239 --> 01:37:49,504
And you gotta go
to the frog.

1342
01:37:49,539 --> 01:37:52,674
You guys sound terrible.
I can't believe how terrible you sound.

1343
01:37:52,709 --> 01:37:56,244
<i>- You're gonna make everybody
sick to their stomachs.</i>

1344
01:37:56,279 --> 01:37:59,216
<i>They're gonna pay $ 1,000 a ticket,
and you're gonna make them throw up.</i>

1345
01:37:59,251 --> 01:38:03,209
Carlos...
you imitating me?

1346
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:07,413
If you're imitating me, you should
do it right. Stand up straight.

1347
01:38:08,925 --> 01:38:11,077
Put that violin up.
Higher, higher.

1348
01:38:11,112 --> 01:38:13,230
Look at your feet.
All crooked.

1349
01:38:13,265 --> 01:38:15,764
Come on, continue.

1350
01:38:15,799 --> 01:38:18,266
That's okay.
You can take it from here.

1351
01:38:18,301 --> 01:38:21,703
Yeah. He's right, you know?
You do sound terrible,

1352
01:38:21,738 --> 01:38:24,841
and you are gonna make everybody sick
to their stomachs.

1353
01:38:24,876 --> 01:38:27,609
<i>Rachel! I can't believe
you're late. Hurry up.</i>

1354
01:38:27,644 --> 01:38:31,637
- I need to talk to you.
- All right, go on in, everybody.

1355
01:38:31,815 --> 01:38:34,182
<i>Start on the Minuet 1, okay?</i>

1356
01:38:34,217 --> 01:38:38,210
<i>I'll be there in a minute.
Hurry up, hurry up. Go, go, go, go, go.</i>

1357
01:38:40,157 --> 01:38:42,124
What's up?

1358
01:38:42,159 --> 01:38:44,828
We're moving away.

1359
01:38:44,863 --> 01:38:47,497
You're moving?
Where?

1360
01:38:47,532 --> 01:38:50,929
It's a secret.

1361
01:38:50,964 --> 01:38:54,326
My father...

1362
01:38:54,504 --> 01:38:57,524
has been hurting my mom.

1363
01:38:57,559 --> 01:39:00,509
So we have to get away.

1364
01:39:00,544 --> 01:39:04,537
Has he been hurting you too?

1365
01:39:06,816 --> 01:39:09,819
I'm sorry
about Juilliard...

1366
01:39:09,854 --> 01:39:13,812
and about the concert.

1367
01:39:14,991 --> 01:39:18,984
What? No. I'm not gonna take your
violin. That's yours. You keep that.

1368
01:39:19,262 --> 01:39:21,731
- No, I don't want it.
- You can't give this up.

1369
01:39:21,766 --> 01:39:25,724
It's a very
important part of you.

1370
01:39:50,393 --> 01:39:52,827
<i>Do the kids know we lost the "Y"?</i>

1371
01:39:52,862 --> 01:39:54,996
<i>- No.
- We gotta find a place.</i>

1372
01:39:55,031 --> 01:39:58,835
<i>- What about the Bronx?
- What about... What about Cleveland?</i>

1373
01:39:58,870 --> 01:40:00,802
We can have it
in Cleveland.

1374
01:40:00,837 --> 01:40:03,004
Mom, no one's gonna go
to the Bronx.

1375
01:40:03,039 --> 01:40:05,408
You gotta have it at one
of the schools. It'll be smaller...

1376
01:40:05,443 --> 01:40:07,409
I can't have it
at a school because...

1377
01:40:07,444 --> 01:40:09,512
- there will not be enough money raised.
- "Enough money."

1378
01:40:09,547 --> 01:40:11,680
No, because it's too small.

1379
01:40:11,715 --> 01:40:13,883
- Then just postpone it.
- I can't postpone it.

1380
01:40:13,918 --> 01:40:16,019
- Why not?
- Because Steinhardt is booked.

1381
01:40:16,054 --> 01:40:18,420
Perlman's booked
all summer long.

1382
01:40:18,455 --> 01:40:21,458
<i>It's not gonna work.</i>

1383
01:40:24,294 --> 01:40:28,031
<i>Roberta! It's me! Are you there?</i>

1384
01:40:28,066 --> 01:40:30,732
What is she doing here?

1385
01:40:30,767 --> 01:40:34,760
Hello, hello. I have good news!
Really good news!

1386
01:40:35,338 --> 01:40:37,340
Arnold got a call from
his friend Wally Schurer...

1387
01:40:37,375 --> 01:40:39,307
who heard about us
losing the "Y,"

1388
01:40:39,342 --> 01:40:41,710
and he wanted to see
how he could help.

1389
01:40:41,745 --> 01:40:44,314
Then Wally had this brilliant idea
and called his friend Isaac Stern,

1390
01:40:44,349 --> 01:40:46,281
and it's all arranged.

1391
01:40:46,316 --> 01:40:48,285
We have a new place
for Fiddlefest.

1392
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:51,755
- Where?
- Carnegie Hall.

1393
01:40:51,790 --> 01:40:54,491
Oh, my God!

1394
01:40:56,726 --> 01:40:58,693
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

1395
01:40:58,728 --> 01:41:02,048
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh! Oh, my...

1396
01:41:02,083 --> 01:41:05,333
<i>Isn't this terrific?</i>

1397
01:41:05,368 --> 01:41:07,837
- It's fantastic!
- It's huge!

1398
01:41:07,872 --> 01:41:10,307
- You're a genius.
- Thank you.

1399
01:41:10,342 --> 01:41:13,043
Whoa!
That's fantastic!

1400
01:41:13,078 --> 01:41:15,710
- Oh, jeez.
- What?

1401
01:41:15,745 --> 01:41:17,712
<i>- We can't play at Carnegie Hall.
- Mom!</i>

1402
01:41:17,747 --> 01:41:19,749
<i>- No, I mean, you know...
- Yeah, you can.</i>

1403
01:41:19,784 --> 01:41:23,742
<i>- Mom.
- It's fantastic.</i>

1404
01:42:05,028 --> 01:42:07,947
<i>Amazing sound, isn't it?</i>

1405
01:42:07,982 --> 01:42:10,832
You must be Roberta.

1406
01:42:10,867 --> 01:42:13,702
- Mr. Stern.
- I was working upstairs...

1407
01:42:13,737 --> 01:42:16,504
and I thought I'd come down
and just welcome you.

1408
01:42:16,539 --> 01:42:18,940
- It's so nice to have you here
in this house.

1409
01:42:18,975 --> 01:42:22,112
Thank you very much
for your help bringing us here.

1410
01:42:22,147 --> 01:42:25,127
Let me show you something.

1411
01:42:25,162 --> 01:42:28,107
If you're very,
very quiet...

1412
01:42:29,519 --> 01:42:32,533
listen and you can hear
Tchaikovsky...

1413
01:42:32,568 --> 01:42:35,547
conducting
the opening concert in 1891.

1414
01:42:38,528 --> 01:42:41,764
And if you listen over there,
you'll hear Jascha Heifetz.

1415
01:42:41,799 --> 01:42:44,966
If you listen over there,
you'll hear Sergey Rachmaninoff.

1416
01:42:45,001 --> 01:42:48,994
<i>And right over here is where
Vladimir Horowitz played on his piano.</i>

1417
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:54,144
And they're all here
in the walls...

1418
01:42:54,179 --> 01:42:57,112
to welcome all
who come here.

1419
01:42:57,147 --> 01:42:59,681
- This is what Carnegie is for,
- Yeah.

1420
01:42:59,716 --> 01:43:02,936
And we are so happy that you
and the children are coming.

1421
01:43:02,971 --> 01:43:06,156
I'm very, very grateful
that you're giving us a chance.

1422
01:43:06,191 --> 01:43:09,057
- I want to ask you a favor.
- Mm-hmm.

1423
01:43:09,092 --> 01:43:13,085
Could I, with a couple of friends,
come and join with you and the kids?

1424
01:43:13,830 --> 01:43:16,798
- We'd love to help.
- Really?

1425
01:43:16,833 --> 01:43:19,235
That would be...
That would be fantastic.

1426
01:43:19,270 --> 01:43:21,536
Well, we'd love
to be part of it.

1427
01:43:21,571 --> 01:43:25,206
Oh, my God, yes.
I mean, yeah, that would be...

1428
01:43:25,241 --> 01:43:28,978
You do such special work.
It's just a way of saying thank you.

1429
01:43:29,013 --> 01:43:32,849
And don't worry.
It will work out. I promise you.

1430
01:43:32,884 --> 01:43:34,984
From your mouth to God's ear.

1431
01:43:44,661 --> 01:43:45,727
<i>Which earrings?</i>

1432
01:43:45,762 --> 01:43:48,998
- Here.
- I'm not gonna wear earrings, Ma. I'm gonna play the violin.

1433
01:43:49,033 --> 01:43:51,566
- At Carnegie Hall.
- Get me two more violins.

1434
01:43:51,601 --> 01:43:53,603
- You can't go to Carnegie Hall...
Ma, you got two already.

1435
01:43:53,638 --> 01:43:57,057
- How many emergencies can there be?
- Get... three.

1436
01:43:57,092 --> 01:44:00,477
And make sure that, um,
two of them are half size.

1437
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:02,444
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

1438
01:44:02,479 --> 01:44:04,446
Lexi, will you call
the car company?

1439
01:44:04,481 --> 01:44:06,483
Mom, they're not gonna
forget to send the car. It will be here.

1440
01:44:06,518 --> 01:44:08,751
- Make sure that, that they're gonna...
- Mom.

1441
01:44:08,786 --> 01:44:11,519
- Yeah?
- What are you doing? Mom...

1442
01:44:11,554 --> 01:44:13,788
- I'm trying to straighten up.
- Mom, you're insane, you know that?

1443
01:44:13,823 --> 01:44:17,760
<i>- It's okay, though. Come on, just get dressed.
- Hang up your nightgown.</i>

1444
01:44:17,795 --> 01:44:19,961
Okay. I'll put
this last one in.

1445
01:44:19,996 --> 01:44:22,131
- I think I'm gonna forget it.
- No, you are not.

1446
01:44:22,166 --> 01:44:25,702
You're gonna be just fine.
Look here.

1447
01:44:25,737 --> 01:44:29,072
Beautiful. Beautiful.

1448
01:44:29,107 --> 01:44:31,074
Ah, Maria.

1449
01:44:33,643 --> 01:44:37,013
<i>I'll be down in a minute!</i>

1450
01:44:39,015 --> 01:44:40,982
Yes!

1451
01:44:41,017 --> 01:44:43,985
<i>Mommy! Ma!</i>

1452
01:44:44,020 --> 01:44:47,255
My God, I caught
the hem on my heel,

1453
01:44:47,290 --> 01:44:50,159
and I can't thread the needle
because my hand is shaking.

1454
01:44:50,194 --> 01:44:52,560
<i>Here.</i>

1455
01:44:52,595 --> 01:44:56,032
- It's not time. It can't be time.
- It's time.

1456
01:44:56,067 --> 01:45:00,025
I'll sew it in the car.

1457
01:45:04,674 --> 01:45:06,641
Oh, my gosh!

1458
01:45:06,676 --> 01:45:08,294
<i>I told you they'd send a car.</i>

1459
01:45:08,329 --> 01:45:09,878
<i>- Hi, Roberta!
- Hi!</i>

1460
01:45:09,913 --> 01:45:11,214
<i>Hi, Mrs. Johnson.</i>

1461
01:45:11,249 --> 01:45:13,181
Thank you.

1462
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:16,951
Give me that skirt.

1463
01:45:16,986 --> 01:45:19,756
- There it is.
- Oh, that's not so bad.

1464
01:45:19,791 --> 01:45:23,749
Thank you, Ma.

1465
01:45:24,260 --> 01:45:26,828
Don't worry about it.
You rip, I sew.

1466
01:45:26,863 --> 01:45:29,866
Not just for that.
For getting me out of bed.

1467
01:45:29,901 --> 01:45:33,069
Oh, don't thank me.
Thank Charles.

1468
01:45:33,104 --> 01:45:35,937
What? Why Charles?

1469
01:45:35,972 --> 01:45:39,965
If he hadn't left you,
none of this would have happened.

1470
01:45:44,881 --> 01:45:48,874
Well, thank you, Charles.

1471
01:45:49,786 --> 01:45:53,779
<i>Okay, okay, okay, okay!</i>

1472
01:45:58,394 --> 01:46:01,931
- Vanessa's missing in action.
- Oh, my God. Did you call her mother and her father?

1473
01:46:01,966 --> 01:46:04,400
- You know, it's two separate places...
- No answer at either!

1474
01:46:04,435 --> 01:46:07,869
- They stole the car.
- What?

1475
01:46:07,904 --> 01:46:11,307
- And the violin was in the car.
- Oh, no. You okay? Nick! Lexi!

1476
01:46:11,342 --> 01:46:14,410
<i>- I need an extra violin!
- Done. It's done.</i>

1477
01:46:14,445 --> 01:46:16,644
Oh, congratulations.

1478
01:46:16,679 --> 01:46:18,681
- It is so beautiful.
- Carnegie Hall.

1479
01:46:18,716 --> 01:46:20,648
- I know.
- Hi.

1480
01:46:20,683 --> 01:46:22,685
Thanks for coming on time, buddy.

1481
01:46:28,725 --> 01:46:32,729
It is you.
Oh, my gosh.

1482
01:46:32,764 --> 01:46:34,729
Congratulations.

1483
01:46:34,764 --> 01:46:38,757
I knew you'd get here, sooner or later.

1484
01:46:40,236 --> 01:46:42,403
Well, thanks.

1485
01:46:42,438 --> 01:46:45,008
I'm just glad
I'm here to see it.

1486
01:46:45,043 --> 01:46:48,123
I'm really glad you are too.

1487
01:46:48,158 --> 01:46:51,203
- Break a leg.
- Thanks.

1488
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:53,982
Can I have your attention,
please?

1489
01:46:54,017 --> 01:46:58,010
This is the five-minute call.
We now have five minutes.

1490
01:46:58,054 --> 01:47:01,990
<i>Oh.</i>

1491
01:47:02,025 --> 01:47:06,018
Galahad.
Thank you so much.

1492
01:47:06,763 --> 01:47:08,663
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1493
01:47:08,698 --> 01:47:11,834
- You're glowing.
- Oh... well, it's terror.

1494
01:47:11,869 --> 01:47:15,737
Thank you.

1495
01:47:15,772 --> 01:47:18,072
If I get through this night...

1496
01:47:18,107 --> 01:47:20,943
Okay, everybody!
Everybody, hey! Come here!

1497
01:47:24,814 --> 01:47:27,183
I just need your attention
for a second.

1498
01:47:27,218 --> 01:47:30,685
Can't see you all.
Okay?

1499
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:34,713
All right, I just want you all to take
a second... and just breathe, okay?

1500
01:47:36,059 --> 01:47:39,060
<i>Deep breath.</i>

1501
01:47:39,095 --> 01:47:42,463
That's good.

1502
01:47:42,498 --> 01:47:46,491
<i>Ten years ago,
Roberta Guaspari-Demetras...</i>

1503
01:47:46,736 --> 01:47:49,939
walked into my office
because she needed a job.

1504
01:47:49,974 --> 01:47:53,142
<i>And, because
she had a vision...</i>

1505
01:47:53,177 --> 01:47:55,109
that any child...

1506
01:47:55,144 --> 01:47:57,912
could learn
to play the violin,

1507
01:47:57,947 --> 01:48:01,884
<i>together we created
the East Harlem Violin Program,</i>

1508
01:48:01,919 --> 01:48:05,154
through which more than
a thousand students...

1509
01:48:05,189 --> 01:48:07,789
have expanded
their vision...

1510
01:48:07,824 --> 01:48:11,817
<i>of what is possible
in their lives.</i>

1511
01:48:12,829 --> 01:48:16,822
<i>When a program like this is cut,
our children's future is compromised.</i>

1512
01:48:18,534 --> 01:48:22,527
I want to thank each of you
for your generous support,

1513
01:48:23,339 --> 01:48:27,332
and I sincerely hope
that you enjoy the concert.

1514
01:48:28,411 --> 01:48:32,404
Thank you.

1515
01:48:34,417 --> 01:48:36,384
<i>Listen to me.</i>

1516
01:48:36,419 --> 01:48:39,956
I would like you all to play...

1517
01:48:39,991 --> 01:48:42,957
from your heart.

1518
01:48:42,992 --> 01:48:44,892
<i>Do you understand me?</i>

1519
01:48:44,927 --> 01:48:47,029
Play like I know you can play.

1520
01:48:47,064 --> 01:48:49,097
<i>Don't look at the audience.</i>

1521
01:48:49,132 --> 01:48:53,125
Watch me.
You do not have to be afraid.

1522
01:48:54,337 --> 01:48:58,330
You are going to be really,
really wonderful tonight.

1523
01:49:01,344 --> 01:49:05,337
Just play from here.

1524
01:49:06,182 --> 01:49:09,585
I'm so proud of you.

1525
01:49:14,123 --> 01:49:16,090
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1526
01:49:16,125 --> 01:49:18,928
<i>the children of the East Harlem
Violin Program,</i>

1527
01:49:18,963 --> 01:49:22,921
<i>led by their teacher

1528
01:51:21,484 --> 01:51:25,315
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
a man who has long been considered...</i>

1529
01:51:25,350 --> 01:51:29,147
<i>the most sought-after and accomplished
fiddler in Nashville, Mark O'Connor.</i>

1530
01:52:42,798 --> 01:52:45,801
Yeah!

1531
01:52:48,704 --> 01:52:50,671
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1532
01:52:50,706 --> 01:52:53,525
<i>as a conclusion to this evening's
wonderful concert,</i>

1533
01:52:53,560 --> 01:52:56,310
<i>we present to you a group
of international artists...</i>

1534
01:52:56,345 --> 01:53:00,338
<i>who have united in support

1535
01:53:00,683 --> 01:53:04,320
<i>It is our great pleasure
to introduce to you: Michael Tree,</i>

1536
01:53:04,355 --> 01:53:06,856
<i>Charles Veal, Jr.,</i>

1537
01:53:06,891 --> 01:53:09,323
<i>Arnold Steinhardt,</i>

1541
01:53:18,069 --> 01:53:20,101
<i>and Mark O'Connor.</i>

1542
01:53:20,136 --> 01:53:23,204
<i>At the piano,
Jonathan Feldman.</i>

1543
01:53:23,239 --> 01:53:25,206
<i>Performing their unique
ensemble version...</i>

1544
01:53:25,241 --> 01:53:29,234
<i>of Bach's Concerto in D Minor
for Two Violins.</i>

1545
01:55:42,378 --> 01:55:46,371
Bravo!

1546
01:56:06,735 --> 01:56:10,728
Come, come,
come, come, come!

1547
01:56:16,312 --> 01:56:19,682
That's my daughter.
That's my daughter.

1548
01:56:19,717 --> 01:56:23,675
And bow.

1549
01:57:15,471 --> 01:57:19,464
When we play the violin, we play
right across those holes because...

1550
01:57:19,541 --> 01:57:21,877
<i>that's where it resonates,
that's where the sound is nice.</i>

1551
01:57:21,912 --> 01:57:24,831
Okay, we're gonna talk
about the bow again.

1552
01:57:24,866 --> 01:57:27,750
- Who remembers what this is?
- Ooh, I know!

1553
01:57:27,785 --> 01:57:29,383
- Yes?
- Frog hair.

1554
01:57:29,418 --> 01:57:32,755
It's... "Frog hair"?
Did you ever see a frog with hair?

1555
01:57:32,790 --> 01:57:34,755
No.

1556
01:57:34,790 --> 01:57:37,291
- No. So what is it?
- Horsehair?

1557
01:57:37,326 --> 01:57:39,995
H-Horse's hair.
That's right, that's right.

1558
01:57:40,030 --> 01:57:43,344
But he's right.
There is a frog here somewhere.

1559
01:57:43,379 --> 01:57:46,658
<i>Let him answer.</i>

1560
01:57:47,369 --> 01:57:49,770
<i>That's right.
That's a frog.</i>

1561
01:57:49,805 --> 01:57:53,440
See him? His little eye?

1562
01:57:53,475 --> 01:57:57,468
Okay, now why do they use horsehair?
Does anybody know?

1563
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:00,714
<i>- Yes?
- It's strong and soft.</i>

1564
01:58:00,749 --> 01:58:02,716
Because it's strong.
A horse's tail...

1565
01:58:02,751 --> 01:58:05,853
The hair is very strong,
and it's very soft.

1566
01:58:05,888 --> 01:58:09,124
That's nice because
when we put the bow on the string,

1567
01:58:09,159 --> 01:58:13,117
it makes a lovely sound.

1568
01:58:31,847 --> 01:58:34,548
<i>You'll never know</i>

1569
01:58:34,583 --> 01:58:38,576
<i>What you've done for me</i>

1570
01:58:38,721 --> 01:58:42,714
<i>What your faith in me</i>

1571
01:58:43,158 --> 01:58:47,151
<i>Has done for my soul</i>

1572
01:58:48,864 --> 01:58:50,831
<i>And you'll never know</i>

1573
01:58:50,866 --> 01:58:54,859
<i>The gift you've given me</i>

1574
01:58:55,471 --> 01:58:59,464
<i>I'll carry it with me</i>

1575
01:58:59,608 --> 01:59:02,142
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

1576
01:59:02,177 --> 01:59:05,163
<i>Through the days ahead</i>

1577
01:59:05,198 --> 01:59:08,115
<i>I think of Days before</i>

1578
01:59:08,150 --> 01:59:12,143
<i>You made me hope
for something better</i>

1579
01:59:12,554 --> 01:59:16,558
<i>- Yes, you did
- And made me reach for something more</i>

1580
01:59:16,593 --> 01:59:18,878
<i>You taught me to run</i>

1581
01:59:18,913 --> 01:59:21,128
<i>You taught me to fly</i>

1582
01:59:21,163 --> 01:59:25,156
<i>Helped me
to free the me inside</i>

1583
01:59:25,734 --> 01:59:29,727
<i>Helped me hear
the music of my heart</i>

1584
01:59:30,005 --> 01:59:33,876
<i>- Helped me hear the music of my heart
- Yeah, yeah</i>

1585
01:59:33,911 --> 01:59:37,811
<i>You opened my eyes
You opened the door</i>

1586
01:59:37,846 --> 01:59:41,839
<i>- To something I'd never known before
- Ooh, ooh</i>

1587
01:59:43,585 --> 01:59:46,521
<i>- And your love
- Your love</i>

1588
01:59:46,556 --> 01:59:50,003
<i>Is the music
of my heart</i>

1589
01:59:50,038 --> 01:59:53,451
<i>The music of my heart</i>

1590
01:59:53,595 --> 01:59:55,829
<i>You were the one</i>

1591
01:59:55,864 --> 01:59:59,857
<i>- Always on my side
- Always on my side</i>

1592
02:00:00,602 --> 02:00:04,595
<i>- Always standing by
- Always standing by</i>

1593
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:09,033
<i>Seeing me through</i>

1594
02:00:10,546 --> 02:00:14,539
<i>You were the song
that always made me sing</i>

1595
02:00:16,518 --> 02:00:18,519
<i>I'm singing this for you</i>

1596
02:00:18,554 --> 02:00:22,547
<i>I'm singing this
for you, baby</i>

1597
02:00:23,225 --> 02:00:26,226
<i>Everywhere I go</i>

1598
02:00:26,261 --> 02:00:28,829
<i>I'll think
of where I've been</i>

1599
02:00:28,864 --> 02:00:32,857
<i>- Think of where I've been
- And of the one who knew me better</i>

1600
02:00:34,002 --> 02:00:38,006
<i>Than anyone
ever will again</i>

1601
02:00:38,041 --> 02:00:40,459
<i>You taught me to run</i>

1602
02:00:40,494 --> 02:00:42,843
<i>You taught me to fly</i>

1603
02:00:42,878 --> 02:00:46,871
<i>Helped me
to free the me inside</i>

<i>Helped me hear
the music of my heart</i>

1605

<i>Helped me hear
the music of my heart</i>

1606
02:00:55,058 --> 02:00:57,257
<i>You opened my eyes</i>

1607
02:00:57,292 --> 02:00:59,595
<i>- You opened the door
- You opened the door</i>

1608
02:00:59,630 --> 02:01:02,898
<i>To something

1609
02:01:02,933 --> 02:01:05,866
<i>- Oh
- And your love</i>

1610
02:01:05,901 --> 02:01:09,894
<i>Your love
is the music of my heart</i>

<i>What you taught me</i>

1616
02:01:30,592 --> 02:01:34,228
<i>Only your love
could ever teach me</i>

1617
02:01:34,263 --> 02:01:38,256
<i>You got through where
no one could reach me</i>

1618
02:01:38,600 --> 02:01:42,593
<i>Before</i>

1619
02:01:43,005 --> 02:01:46,998
<i>Because you always
saw in me</i>

1620
02:01:47,276 --> 02:01:51,269
<i>All the best
that I could be</i>

1621
02:01:51,613 --> 02:01:55,606
