15
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,260
Welcome to the comedy central

16

Roast of roseanne!

17
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:37,663
Goodness

18
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,998
What a night.

19
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:44,736
Roseanne, ellen barkin, casey

20
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:48,507
Segal, carrie fisher.

21
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:55,576
It's like a menopausal palooza:

22
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:01,920
This show is serving up more old

23
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:04,256
Spoiled hens than a chick-fil-a.

24
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:10,696
Oh, that reminds me.

25
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:11,430
[bleep] chick-fil-a.

26
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:14,900
And roseanne is referred t as

27
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,268
Just one name, bitch!

28
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:17,703
Ellen barkin is here.

29
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:18,270
Huh?

30
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,038
[applause]

31
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:26,145
Ellen, your sxcene is "sea of

32
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:28,547
Love" is the reason I'm a

33
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:29,114
Lesbian.

34
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:34,353
Nothing like seeing al pacino's

35
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:38,056
Bare as on the screen to make a

36
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,124
Girl want to eat [bleep] like

37
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:41,293
She's about to be executed.

38
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:42,094
Carrie fisher is here!

39
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:48,133
[cheers & applause]

40
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:52,838
Now, carrie's here to put

41
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:55,307
Roseanne's weight and drug

42
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:56,475
Problems into perspective.

43
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:59,845
Carrie was one of the hottest

44
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:01,280
Actresses in hollywood.

45
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,215
Tt was long ago in a galaxy

46
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:04,216
Far, far away.

47
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:05,851
One of the good ones.

48
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,618
Wayne brady is here.

49
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,621
[cheers & applause]

50
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,956
Now, wayne, you're going to hear

51
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,758
A lot of jokes about how you're

52
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,059
Not a real black man.

53
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:18,330
I want you to know, I still hid

54
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:18,964
My purse.

55
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:19,665
Good, good.

56
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,034
[laughter]

57
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:29,102
But enough about these vile

58
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:32,177
Degenerate failures.

59
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:33,612
Before we bring roseanne out

60
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:35,080
Tonight, let's take a look back

61
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:37,282
At her many career highlights so

62
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:40,819
Her viewers under the age of 20

63
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,789
Can stop asking who the [bleep]

64
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:44,790
She is

65
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,792
roseanne barr.

66
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,660
A husband thinks a wife knows

67
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,461
where every thing is.

68
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,829
Like a uterus is a tracking

69
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:51,463
device.

70
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:56,101
[laughter]

71
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,172
I like that joan jett.

72
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:01,907
I can't even remember the

73
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:03,041
last time we had sex.

74
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,542
I can.

75
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:05,577
That's why we ain't doing it.

76
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:09,581
When I was 12 years old, I

77
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,684
Signe a deal because I wanted

78
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:19,786
To get famous no matter what.

79
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:22,094
You ever sorry we got

80
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:22,427
Married?

81
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,596
Every second of my life.

82
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:25,797
Why are you so mean?

83
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,132
Because I hate kids.

84
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:29,368
She starred in the

85
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,802
Ground-breaking show,

86
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,371
"roseanne," she never shied away

87
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,039
From contentious issues.

88
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:38,310
It featured the first lesbian

89
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:39,144
Kiss on tv.

90
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:40,679
And then I had this tragic

91
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:42,114
Singing accident.

92
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:42,981
Oh, yeah.

93
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,050
ｶ and the home of the brave ｶ

94
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,151
disgusting.

95
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,252
So anti-american.

96
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:48,453
Scratching herself and

97
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:53,925
Spitting.

98
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:57,496
The nationa anthem?

99
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,898
I don't think so.

100
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,034
You think I'm pretty?

101
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:05,837
Don't say that on television.

102
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,906
[bleep] you!

103
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:17,883
So those macadamia nuts...

104
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,084
those are my nuts.

105
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:20,986
I need to run for president.

106
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:22,020
I'm not kidding.

107
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:23,288
This is america, land of the

108
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:25,457
Free.

109
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:29,828
I have to call my

110
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:30,262
Psychiatri.

111
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:32,798
That's what makes me me.

112
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,399
I can't begin to tell you

113
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:36,335
What a privilege it is for you

114
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:39,604
To have me here tonight.

115
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:40,639
Let's start this show!

116
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:45,277
[cheers & applause]

117
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:47,245
She is a personal inspiration

118
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:54,314
To me an an absolute comedic

119
00:05:59,460 --> 00:05:59,725
Genius.

120
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,727
Please welcome america's

00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:05,464

128
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,164
Hello darling.

129
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,066

00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:45,036
Roseanne, it's greato

133
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:45,737
Finally meet you.

134
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:48,006
You know, I waved to you outside

135
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,474
But realized it was one of

136
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:52,644
Those inflating parking lot

137
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:53,011
Gorillas.

138
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,146
What a huge mark you've made on

139
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:55,514
The entertainment industry.

140
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,450
There your ground-breaking

141
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,751
Show "roseanne" and then

142
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,318
There'... yes!

143
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:04,222
[applause]

144
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:07,426
And then of urse there's

145
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,693
Reruns of "roseanne."

146
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,762
And having a hit show finally

147
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:12,230
Allowed you to do what you truly

148
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:13,765
Love to do, fire people.

149
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:15,066
[laughter]

150
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:16,468
Let's not forget your movie

151
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:21,173
Career like the rest of america.

152
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:26,378
You co-starred in "she devil"

153
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:27,279
With meryl stree

154
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:32,350
That movie got 2 1/2 stars jt

155
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:37,456
Like this stage.

156
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:39,791
Of course, you've experienced

157
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,292
Controversy.

158
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,627
Everybody remembers your version

159
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:44,596
Of the star spangd banner.

160
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:48,000
What could have predicted your

161
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:48,900
Beautiful speaking voice

162
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,101
Wouldn't translate to singing.

163
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,204
In your defense, you said there

164
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,171
Was something wrong with the

165
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,806
Sound system that y.

166
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:55,474
There was.

167
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:56,608
It had been turned on.

168
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:59,945
Then you moved on to spiritual

169
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,012
Pursuits.

170
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,681
Roseanne, you're a jew that

171
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,649
Converted to more man, that

172
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:06,384
Converteto kablah and in

173
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:08,220
1990 you converted to white

174
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:10,755
Trash when you mried tom

175
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:11,256
Arnold.

176
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:12,858
Now, roseanne, it's not your

177
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:15,894
Fault you're attracted to tom.

178
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:17,696
You saw with all that white

179
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,765
Powder on his upper lip, there

180
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,799
Must be a doughnut somewhere.

181
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:22,468
[Ghter]

182
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:27,239
Roseanne said she had plastic

183
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,841
Surgery to get away from tom

184
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,010
Arnold much like a nonazy

185
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:32,811
Peon would use a car.

186
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,313
[laughter]

187
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:36,982
By the way, tom arnold wted to

188
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,084
Be here tonight but at the last

189
00:08:39,153 --> 00:08:39,985
Minute nobody asked him.

190
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,953
[laughter]

191
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,855
I really don't know a lot about

192
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:44,889
Roseanne's current boyfriend.

193
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,594
I do know one thing.

194
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,362
He's into fat chicks.

195
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,630
[laughter]

196
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:52,797
Roseanne, you've admitted to

197
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,133
Having multiple personalities.

198
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,302
It's amazing you couldn't find

199
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,371
One that was likeable.

200
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:01,172
And it's true that roseanne goes

201
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,407
Off the grid from time to time.

202
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:04,242
This allows the grid to maiain

203
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:05,377
Its structural integrity.

204
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:07,979
[laughter]

205
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,548
But this year she's announced

00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:12,617
Her campaign for presidency.

207
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:16,821
[cheers & applause]

208
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,356
Mitt romney sent roseanne

209
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:19,925
Flowers for making him the

210
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:25,363
Second most hated morman in the

211
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:25,664

215
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:32,270
Fears nothing and whose ass is

[cheers & applause]

223
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:46,618
Now, amy didn't have to blow

224
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:47,919
Someone to be on the stage

225
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:48,853
Tonight, but she insisted on it.

226
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,889
[laughter]

227
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:51,690

Roseanne, ellen, jane, kate.

Tired, sweeting.

241
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,696
I haven't seen this much skin

243
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:34,232

Why doesn't anyone care?

263
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,404
No one up here can do what you

264
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:13,238
Do

265
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:14,472
When someone mentioned whos

00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,107

267
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,443
Carrie fisher yells out "mine"!

[laughter]

269
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,783

00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:03,755
The news.

426
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:06,491
It would be perfect for people

00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:28,446
Gilbert gottfried, I don't know

00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:29,147
Why you squint a lot.

437
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,083
We're the ones that have to look

438
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:32,417
At you.

439
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:35,453

440
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:37,255

Fact of life."

444
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:47,794
Now you're a star on the sons of

445
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:57,041
Anarchy.

446
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,976

00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,846
Roseanne, you need another show.

450
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:04,615
You're spending too much time on

451
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:05,083
Twitter.

452
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:06,117
It's annoying.

453
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:08,019
I tweet a lot but you tweet more

454
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,054

457
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:12,790
Okay.

458
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:14,192
Last time I saw roseanne, she

459
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:17,028
Was in a snickers commercial.

460
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:18,329
Because that's what america is

461
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:18,729
Thinking.

462
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:19,964

463
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:25,903

464
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:32,972

Sitcom "married with children."

478
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:05,910

Thank you, jane.

484
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:19,657
I have been a fan of your work

485
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:22,293
Since you were cutting down the

486
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:25,796
Redwood with your big blue ox.

487
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,732
I'm not sure if u know this,

488
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,735
But jane came out to her parents

489
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:31,802
In a letter.

490
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:35,039
There hasn't been a letter that

491
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:37,208
Unnecessary since the p in

492
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:37,742
Pneumonia.

493
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,810
Ellen barkin is here.

494
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:43,147
Ellen, you're a survivor.

495
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:44,682
When your second marriage fell

496
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:46,017
Apart, you didn't sit around

497
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,385
Feeling sorry for yourself.

498
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:50,755
You took your $40 million...

499
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:51,556
20.

500
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:54,559
Your $20 million

501
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:55,860
Settlement... whatever!

502
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:57,161
My kids think they're richer

503
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:57,862
Than we are.

504
00:19:57,931 --> 00:19:59,564
You took all that money and

505
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:00,798
You paid someone else to sit

506
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:04,669
Around and feel sorry for you.

507
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:05,770
And amy schumer

508
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:07,672
You know, this business can

509
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,073
Really be tough on women.

510
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:11,175
Many of them develop eating

511
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:13,110
Disorders in an effort to be

512
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:13,978
Thin.

513
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:14,478
Just a suggestion.

514
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,547
[laughter]

515
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,753

00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:25,723
Thin, it's so good to see seth

00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:26,157

00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,559
Seth, you being here marks the

519
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:30,127
First time someo your size has

Beenn comedy central without

521
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,133

522
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:41,172
[laughter]

00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:44,909
Wayne brady.

525
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:47,411
Wayne is kind of talented, kind

526
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,015
Of funny and kind of black meet.

527
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:54,218
And then there's jane lynch.

528
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:56,654

In show biz.

531
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:04,829
Quite an honor even in there are

532
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:05,329
Only seven of you.

533
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:09,734
[laughter]

534
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:12,136
Jeff ross was also on the list

535
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:13,437
After they confused him for

536
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:14,605
Being a lesbian.

537
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:17,575
Ands will for being in show biz.

538
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:19,243
[laughter]

539
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:20,978
And I have to say it's great to

540
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:23,080
See roseanne back in the

541
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:23,447

00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:25,383
Thank you!

543
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,550
Thank you, katey.

544
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,053
I mean, you know, technically

545
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:31,122
It's two spotlights.

546
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,391
But you get the idea.

547
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,459
Roseanne was a trail-blazing

548
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:38,963
Comedy icon that created the

549
00:21:39,032 --> 00:21:45,069
Character of an irrevent smart

550
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:46,470

00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,906
Seen sce I did it on "married

552
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,008

553
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:53,311
[cheers & applause]

554
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:56,347
Roseanne broke into the reality

555
00:21:56,416 --> 00:22:01,218
World with "roseanne's nuts."

556
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:05,189
The show about her and johnny

557
00:22:05,258 --> 00:22:12,258
Argent running a macadamia farm.

558
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:19,437
Roseanne, I feel honored that

Moms that didn't cook, didn't

561
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:27,511
Clean and didn't make any money.

562
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,447
In the 90s, it makes you a bad

00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:29,914

Give it up for your host

602
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:44,789
Tonight, denis leary.

603
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:48,859
[laughter]

604
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,227
I think chris is here from

605
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:50,561
Lee."

606
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,862
This is so cool.

607
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,899
I love "glee."

608
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,201
Jane, it's my favorite show.

609
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,102
It is.

610
00:23:58,171 --> 00:24:00,471
Except for the one time they let

611
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,138
You sing.

612
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:02,973
I haven't heard sounds that

613
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:06,911
Disturbing since I hung out in

614
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,446
Sandusky's basement.

615
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:09,680
Too soon for the "glee" joke?

616
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:12,249
[laughter]

617
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:13,584
Folks, if you're offended by

618
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:15,319
What you see tonight, just do

619
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:18,456
What joe paterno did.

620
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:21,592
Look the other way.

621
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:23,427
Again, jane, thanks for hosting.

622
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:25,196
You're probably the most beloved

623
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:26,797
Person in comedy right now.

624
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:28,899
Before the show, I even heard

625
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:33,737
The crowd chanting "lynch,

626
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:34,071
Lynch."

627
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,675
And that was just during wayne

628
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:38,242
Brady's introduction.

629
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:42,012
[laughter]

630
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:44,682
Please, is that wayne brady or

631
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,651
Didl jolson forget to take off

632
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,219
His makeup?

633
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:51,055
How did you make a career out of

634
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:57,461
Corporate teen-building

635
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:57,862
Exercises?

636
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,197
If you're just tuning in, no,

637
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:01,632
This is not a lifetime original

638
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:02,099
Movie.

639
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:06,937
[laughter]

640
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:07,805
Thank you.

641
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:09,340
Ellen barkin, you always been

642
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:10,474
Ahead of your time.

643
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:15,446
Voted hottest woman over 30 at

644
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:16,413
Age 36.

645
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:19,583
Carrie fisher, make yourself

646
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:19,984
Comfortable.

647
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:21,886
Chain yourself to roseanne's

648
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:22,186
Chair.

649
00:25:22,255 --> 00:25:23,187
What does that mean?

650
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:26,390
I don't get that.

651
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:28,192
It's a [bleep] star wars

652
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:28,526
Joke.

653
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:32,029
Oh, I don't get it.

654
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:33,397
You should know.

655
00:25:33,466 --> 00:25:36,133
You're dressed like yoda's

656
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:36,500
Grandma.

657
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:40,771
[laughter]

658
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,806
I'm telling you, this roast

659
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:43,941
Stuff doesn't take commercial

660
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,576
Breaks.

661
00:25:45,645 --> 00:25:46,143
It takes a menopause.

662
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,311
[laughr]

663
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,647
And anthony, I'm hearing you're

664
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,749

00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:55,519
Pilot.

666
00:25:55,588 --> 00:25:55,953
John travolta.

667
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:57,955
[laughter]

668
00:25:58,024 --> 00:26:02,760
I see the world's uglyist

669
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:05,296
[bleep] gilbert gottfried is

670
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:06,530
Here tonight.

671
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:11,468
You look like benjamin button

672
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:11,902
When he was 6.

673
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:13,537
[laughter]

674
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:15,839
Gilbert has kept a low profile

675
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:20,444
Since he was fired from aflec

676
00:26:20,513 --> 00:26:23,514
For an insensitive tweet.

677
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,549
Gilbt, if you want an

678
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:27,284
Insensitive tweet, tweet about

679
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:29,086
Ellen barkin's makeup.

680
00:26:29,155 --> 00:26:30,054
Too soon, too soon.

681
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:35,192
No, too good.

682
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:36,260
You look beautiful.

683
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:39,563
I have to hand it to you, you

684
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:41,498
Have been torchered and abused

685
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,534
All night and still hanging in

686
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:44,134
There.

687
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:45,135
Roseanne, I'm not talking to

688
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:45,402
You.

689
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:46,804
I'm talking about the chair

690
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:47,304
You're sitting on.

691
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:51,208
[laughter]

692
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:51,976
Oh, wait.

693
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:53,043
You know what?

694
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,145
Normally when I roast a pig, it

695
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:57,448
Has an apple in its mouth.

696
00:26:57,516 --> 00:26:59,516
[laughter]

697
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,624
After our last roast, I said, we

698
00:27:06,692 --> 00:27:08,125
Need someone bigger than charlie

699
00:27:08,194 --> 00:27:09,627
Sheen.

700
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:10,227
This isn't what I meant.

701
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:11,829
[laughter]

702
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:14,031
Last year we roasted charlie.

703
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,566
This year we're roasting the

704
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:16,767
Chocolate factory.

705
00:27:16,836 --> 00:27:17,568
What?

706
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:18,569
What is that joke?

707
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:20,771
You want me to explain the

708
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,338
[bleep] jokes to you?

709
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:22,473
I didn't hear it.

710
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:26,644
It means your fat.

711
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:27,811
Oh, okay.

712
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,481
I'm looking forward to your new

713
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:34,718
Show, "tons of anarchy."

714
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:35,986
Instead ofunning for

715
00:27:36,055 --> 00:27:37,988
President, why don't you try

716
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:38,589
Walking on a treadmill?

717
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:41,325
[laughter]

718
00:27:41,394 --> 00:27:43,627
I'd vote for you but I'm against

719
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:44,094
Big government.

720
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,129
[laughter]

721
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:46,897
Roseanne joined the green party

722
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:47,831
Because she was kicked out of

723
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,068
The tea party for eating all the

724
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:51,435
Crumpets.

725
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:53,704
[laughter]

726
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:54,271
Nice one!

727
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,206
How manyersonalities you

728
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:56,607
Have?

729
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:57,775
Eight, nine?

730
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:04,114
At are the odds they are all

731
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:04,581
[bleep]?

732
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,950
Comedy comes from pain, people.

733
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,053
And nobody knows tt better

734
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:09,720
Than this woman.

735
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:16,822
The legendary roseanne barr.

736
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:18,762
[cheers & applause]

737
00:28:18,831 --> 00:28:20,964
She was molested as a child.

738
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,467
Oh, that poor molester.

739
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:27,037
[laughter]

740
00:28:27,106 --> 00:28:29,273
Roseanne neverot over it.

741
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:30,708
She felt violated.

742
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:32,076
She had trust issues.

743
00:28:32,178 --> 00:28:34,111
She never got the candy he

744
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:34,545
Promised her.

745
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:39,383
[laughter]

746
00:28:39,452 --> 00:28:40,517
Roseanne, I'll always love you

747
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:42,052
For saying whatever you want,

748
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:43,353
For never holding back.

749
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:45,923
In these alarming times when

750
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:46,857
Comedians are second guessing

751
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:48,425
Their imaginations and sometimes

752
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:51,095
Even apologizing for jokes, I

753
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:53,597
Conside you a hero and a martyr

754
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:54,331
And a friend.

755
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,065
Thank you.

756
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:58,502
Thanks very much.

757
00:28:58,571 --> 00:28:59,670
I love you.

758
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:00,270

00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:23,227

00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:34,304
Wayne said he got his

770
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:35,672
Inspiration when he watched a

771
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:38,742
Summer camp production of "hello

772
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:39,610

00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:40,844
Want to do, be gay!

Prizes, none of that stuff.

785
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:07,137
No making up songs.

786
00:30:07,206 --> 00:30:11,241

00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:17,875
That's okay.

818
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:20,611
That's all right.

00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:24,014
Oh, by the way, those al jolson

Lot of people hate you.

830
00:31:38,364 --> 00:31:39,329
Especially sarah palin.

831
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,098
Because you remindmer of what

832
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:44,635
Trying is going to look like

833
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:45,068
When he's 40.

834
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:47,871

00:31:57,716 --> 00:32:00,684

844
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,256

That's why I love you.

847
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:12,896
Bad marriages, mental illness,

Plus you look like roseanne.

849
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:17,367
[laughter]

850
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:20,570

You wreak of marijuana.

852
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:22,906
That's seth ross.

853
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:28,412
You're kind of like willie

854
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,480
Nelson's tour bus, except people

855
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:31,481
Still want to ride that.

856
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:35,619
And now, all that being said, I

857
00:32:35,688 --> 00:32:38,655
Really think that your a comedic

858
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:40,457

[applause]

869
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,686
She became famous with

00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:10,253
Travelling into space.

871
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,722
Now she can be seen from it.

872
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,223

Good menstruation joke.

879
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:34,611

So I'm carrie.

883
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,419
I'm a alcoholic.

884
00:33:42,488 --> 00:33:42,919
Okay.

885
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:45,288
Roseanne... I can't say oops,

886
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,390
Wrong room!

887
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,657
Roseanne, when they first asked

888
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:51,561
Me to do the show tonight, I

889
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,696
Said y?

890
00:33:52,765 --> 00:33:54,865
And then ty explained that we

00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:59,403
Were good friends and that we

892
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:00,137
Apparently have worked together.

893
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:02,139

894
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,807

[laughter]

899
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:12,449
It must be true.

904
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:23,160

00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,102
Thank you, thank you.

909
00:34:32,171 --> 00:34:37,607
Makes this a lot easier, believe

910
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:37,874
Me.

911
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:41,912
But you know, I'm not the only

912
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,312
One.

913
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:43,647
Jeff ross.

914
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:45,982
God, you give so much of

915
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:48,452
Yourself entertaining our troops

916
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:48,952
Overseas.

917
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:50,854
Not by doing standup.

918
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:54,458
They just like watching fat guys

919
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:57,260
Get out of helicopters.

920
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:57,694
There you go.

921
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:00,630
[laughter]

922
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:03,800
Eaking of electro convulsive

923
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:04,167
Therapy.

924
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:05,602
I learned two things tonight

925
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:07,537
Bumping into seth green back

926
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:08,305
Stage.

927
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:10,173
He is a big star wars fan.

928
00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:12,943
And I apparently was in star

929
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:13,243
Wars.

930
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:17,747
[laughter]

931
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:19,516
So amazing!

932
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:23,053
That must have been great.

933
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:28,258
You know... now, wayne brady,

934
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:29,459
How a you?

935
00:35:29,528 --> 00:35:31,895
You're so white that I tried to

936
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:34,364
Snort you back stage, didn't I?

937
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:34,731
I'm sorry.

938
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,269
[laughter]

939
00:35:39,338 --> 00:35:41,905
Wow!

940
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:44,474
Now, I have seen gilbert

941
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:46,843
Gottfried at 12-step meetings.

942
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:48,812
He was not actually there.

943
00:35:48,881 --> 00:35:51,815
They held a picture up of him

944
00:35:51,884 --> 00:35:55,418
And they said, if you [bleep]

945
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:58,989
This man, a, how humiliating for

00:35:59,057 --> 00:36:01,958
You and b, you must be a

00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:02,359

948
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:05,862
[laughter]

949
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:08,431
At least I hope so.

950
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,065
Jane...

951
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:10,367

952
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:13,069
Oh, dear, I love you, too.

953
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:14,471
I do love you on "glee."

954
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,238
I do.

955
00:36:15,307 --> 00:36:18,041
It's a change to see a coach

956
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:20,477
That doesn't take showers with

957
00:36:20,546 --> 00:36:21,211
Little boys.

958
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,079
Hey, wait a mite!

959
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:23,880

960
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:24,181
What?

961
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:25,482
You're going to take exception

962
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:25,982
To that?

963
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:26,583
You did that joke.

964
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:27,684
No, no, no.

965
00:36:27,753 --> 00:36:28,685
Not that?

966
00:36:28,754 --> 00:36:28,985
N

967
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:31,888

Joke.

[laughter]

972
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:38,662
Okay.

973
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:38,995
So...

974
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:40,730
[laughter]

975
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:41,031
Yeah.

976
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:48,099
[cheers & applause]

977
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:50,006
Hilarious!

978
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:51,141
Anthony jeselnik, I've heard

979
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:54,711
That you are a pretty gutsy guy.

980
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:59,316
You say what other rapists only

981
00:36:59,384 --> 00:36:59,616
Think.

982
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:02,219
You don't get your period

983
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:03,587
Anymore, do you?

984
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:05,522
God, I could laugh about that

985
00:37:05,591 --> 00:37:06,423
All night.

986
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:07,857
Now, I'm going to talk about

987
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:10,827
Someone I have a lot of history

988
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:11,127
With.

989
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:13,697
Someone who has always been

990
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:17,934
There for me... not really, but

991
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:18,301
Roseanne.

992
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:20,537
You know, roseanne and I, we're

993
00:37:20,606 --> 00:37:24,307
Both feminists, am I right?

994
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:24,774
You're right.

995
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:26,209
[applause]

996
00:37:26,278 --> 00:37:26,810
That's it.

997
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:29,412
You know, we think women can do

998
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:30,347
Anything that men can do.

999
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,916
In fact, we were discussing this

1000
00:37:32,985 --> 00:37:35,252
Earlier at the urinal.

1001
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:35,685
Remember that?

1002
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:39,055
[laughter]

1003
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:41,992
Okay.

1004
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,327
Roseanne, you battled the voices

1005
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:45,895
In your head to become one of

1006
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:51,368
The greatest comedians and

1007
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:54,204
Become one of the greatest

1008
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:56,006
Sitcom stars of all time.

1009
00:37:56,074 --> 00:37:57,807
If I had to come up with a

1010
00:37:57,876 --> 00:38:00,810
Reason why I love you so much,

1011
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:04,281
It would have to be because I

1012
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:07,250
Have done so much dope that I

1013
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:11,021
Have no idea who the [bleep] you

1014
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:11,288
Are.

1015
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:12,789
Or who I am or where I am.

1016
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:15,091
[laughter]

1017
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:15,492
Thank you!

1018
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:21,398
[cheers & applause]

00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:24,000
Coming up, ellen bain.

And anthony jeselnik.

1022
00:38:40,052 --> 00:38:45,255
Ur next roaster is an tony

00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:45,622
Jeselnik.

1024
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:46,356
[applause]

1025
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:49,759
This fellow is famous for his

1026
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,795
One-liners like "I never touched

1027
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:52,362
Her."

1028
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:54,030
"I have an alibi."

1029
00:38:54,099 --> 00:39:00,170
Or "talk to my lawyer

1030
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:02,005
Clap your hands or pretend like

1031
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:04,207
You recognize an tony jeselnik.

1032
00:39:04,276 --> 00:39:06,476
[applause]

1033
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:09,546
Thank you, thank you.

1034
00:39:09,614 --> 00:39:11,414
When comedy central asked me to

1035
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:15,518
Be here tonight, I told them to

1036
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:17,520

1041
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:34,204
No matter how I think it's going

1042
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:37,907
To turn out, there's never a

1043
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:39,342
School shooting.

1044
00:39:39,411 --> 00:39:41,211
My good friend jeff ross is all

00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:41,978
Dressed up tonight.

1046
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:43,346
Yeah, man.

1047
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:47,517
Jeff, you look like something

1048
00:39:47,586 --> 00:39:51,621
A mongoliod kid put together at

Actor.

Children."

1056
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:02,932
A show that changed comedy.

1057
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:05,034
"Sons of anarchy."

1058
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:07,137
The show that took drama to a

1059
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:08,271
New level.

1060
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,873
And "eight simple rules".

1061
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:16,112
The show that killed john

1062
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:16,446
Ritter.

1063
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:18,281
[laughter]

1064
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,449
Wow!

Boo, bitches, boo!

1066
00:40:24,423 --> 00:40:26,122
Seth green is here

1067
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:28,691
Everybody has that one weird

00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,060
Creepy uncle?

1069
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:32,695
Well, seth green looks like he

1070
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:39,764
Got raped by all of them.

1071
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:42,305
Ellen barkin, baby doll.

1072
00:40:42,374 --> 00:40:45,675

September 11th.

1077
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:52,382
That sounds about right.

1078
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:54,851
[laughter]

1079
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,586
I never thought of that!

1080
00:40:56,655 --> 00:40:58,755
Every clip I've seen feels

1081
00:40:58,824 --> 00:41:05,824
Like I'm watching a third tower

1082
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:06,196
Collapse.

1083
00:41:06,264 --> 00:41:07,263
Suck it!

And wayne brady.

1085
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:10,066
Wayne, I don't understand why

1086
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:11,835
People keep joking that you're

1087
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:12,368
Not black.

1088
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:14,404
Wayne brady, you are black!

1089
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:16,539
After all, I only remember you

1090
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:18,274
For all of t years you played

1091
00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:21,978
An uppity slave on "whose line

1092
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:22,445
Is it anyway."

1093
00:41:22,514 --> 00:41:26,449
[laughter]

1094
00:41:26,518 --> 00:41:28,284
I was good.

1095
00:41:28,353 --> 00:41:28,985
I was good.

1096
00:41:29,054 --> 00:41:32,755
Now for the lady of honor,

1097
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:33,523
Miss roseanne barr.

1098
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:36,593
[cheers & applause]

1099
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:39,829
Oh, boy, I can't wait!

1100
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:41,364
Roseanne, your bid for

1101
00:41:41,433 --> 00:41:42,365
President was a failure.

1102
00:41:42,434 --> 00:41:43,833
You said that you'd like to

1103
00:41:43,902 --> 00:41:45,602
Become prime minister of israel

1104
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,103
One day.

1105
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:48,738
That could happen.

1106
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:50,540
Those people are [bleep] idiots.

1107
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:54,377
[laughter]

1108
00:41:54,446 --> 00:41:55,912
Roseanne, even though you're a

1109
00:41:55,981 --> 00:41:58,047
Feminist icon, so many men have

1110
00:41:58,116 --> 00:42:00,016
Gotten rich off of you.

1111
00:42:00,085 --> 00:42:02,685
Tom arnold, john goodman, the

00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:04,354
Guy who owns the cheesecake

1113
00:42:04,422 --> 00:42:04,687
Factory.

1114
00:42:04,756 --> 00:42:06,756
[laughter]

1115
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:21,699
And roseanne, you were knnotoris

1116
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:28,177
For being a tyrant on your

1117
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:28,511
Sitcom.

1118
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,946
In fact, the entire cast and

1119
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:32,181
Crew always had to wal on

1120
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,350
Eggshells around you because you

1121
00:42:34,419 --> 00:42:37,220
Could not stop eating eggs.

1122
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:40,857
Here's something positive.

1123
00:42:40,926 --> 00:42:45,628
You had gastric bypass surgery

1124
00:42:45,697 --> 00:42:49,399
In 1998 and then youeat it.

1125
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:49,933
[cheers & applause]

1126
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:51,668
But roseanne, despite everything

1127
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:56,372
I just said, there's not a comic

1128
00:42:56,441 --> 00:42:58,875
Alive who doesn't owe a great

1129
00:42:58,944 --> 00:42:59,409
Debt to you.

1130
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:01,110

1141
00:43:23,401 --> 00:43:25,001
Younger viewers might know her

From [bleep] her.

"the new normal" which critics

1146
00:43:31,376 --> 00:43:32,709
Are already describing as

00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:33,109

1148
00:43:33,178 --> 00:43:35,545
[laughter]

1149
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:37,680
Ladies and gentlemen, please

Thank you, jane.

1153
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:51,194
I had a cocktail before I came

1154
00:43:51,262 --> 00:43:51,461
On.

1155
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:52,629
I admit it.

1156
00:43:52,697 --> 00:43:54,330
And then I had three more

1157
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:54,731
Cocktails

1158
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,065
[laughter]

1159
00:43:56,134 --> 00:44:01,604
And then I had a valium.

1160
00:44:01,673 --> 00:44:04,474
I was very scared and very

1161
00:44:04,542 --> 00:44:07,010
Intimidated by being surrounded

1162
00:44:07,078 --> 00:44:13,249
By real comedians here tonight.

1163
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:14,283
Luckily the [bleep] jeff ross is

1164
00:44:14,352 --> 00:44:14,584

1165
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:15,718
That was a relief.

1166
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:17,153

1169
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:20,390
Don't you think you should say

00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:24,827
Thank you to roseanne for paving

1171
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:27,930
The way for bus-size women for

00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:30,700
Getting their own tv shows?

1173
00:44:30,769 --> 00:44:31,167
You're right.

1174
00:44:31,236 --> 00:44:33,870
[applause]

1175
00:44:33,938 --> 00:44:38,141

00:44:38,209 --> 00:44:39,409
Hi, len.

00:44:39,477 --> 00:44:41,744

00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:47,316
Red head that could never get

1180
00:44:47,385 --> 00:44:48,885
Laid?

1181
00:44:48,953 --> 00:44:49,552

1182
00:44:49,621 --> 00:44:51,621

And gilbert gottfried.

1184
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:01,998
I am so glad you could take a

1185
00:45:02,067 --> 00:45:04,233
Break from starring directly

1186
00:45:04,302 --> 00:45:05,902
Into the sun to be with us

1187
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:06,235
Tonight.

1188
00:45:06,304 --> 00:45:10,673
[laughter]

1189
00:45:10,742 --> 00:45:12,709
But now it's time to turn our

1190
00:45:12,777 --> 00:45:15,611
Attention to the sexiest [bleep]

1191
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,847
Bitch on this stage.

1192
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:18,915
Miss roseanne barr!

1193
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:23,186
[cheers & applause]

1194
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:26,823
Now, roseanne, I'm only here

1195
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:28,324
Because shon stone dropped out

1196
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:32,028

1197
00:45:32,097 --> 00:45:34,497
That [bleep].

1198
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:36,566
[laughter]

1199
00:45:41,473 --> 00:45:43,372
Hat's not true.

1200
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:44,841
Roseanne, it was very

1201
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:47,076
Important for me to be here for

1202
00:45:47,145 --> 00:45:47,410
You.

1203
00:45:47,479 --> 00:45:48,177
Do you remember that [bleep]

1204
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:51,414
Bitch that tweeted at me and

1205
00:45:51,483 --> 00:45:53,416
Called me a [bleep] crazele

00:45:53,485 --> 00:45:56,819
Robbing washed up s-been pig

1207
00:45:56,888 --> 00:46:00,223
Who should find a man my own age

1208
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:04,327
Instead of parading around with

1209
00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:06,496
Some boy toy that I would never

1210
00:46:06,564 --> 00:46:08,965
Get if I didn't used to be

1211
00:46:09,033 --> 00:46:11,067
Famous in the 80s?

1212
00:46:11,136 --> 00:46:13,736
In the end, roseanne, in my

1213
00:46:13,805 --> 00:46:16,873
Defense, she took to twitter and

1214
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:21,844
She told that [bleep] bitch,

1215
00:46:21,913 --> 00:46:27,250

00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:29,018
[cheers & applause]

1217
00:46:29,087 --> 00:46:33,790

1219
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:37,727

1220
00:46:37,796 --> 00:46:40,263

00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:43,299
Homework that night.

1222
00:46:43,368 --> 00:46:47,570
But there was no way I was

1223
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:49,272

1224
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:52,108

New one.

1266
00:48:53,932 --> 00:48:57,333
Quite frankly, I've seen the old

00:48:57,402 --> 00:48:57,633
One.

1268
00:48:57,702 --> 00:48:58,467
It is spectacular.

1269
00:48:58,536 --> 00:49:00,269
It could use little paint,

1270
00:49:00,338 --> 00:49:01,837
Maybe a couple plants in the

1271
00:49:01,906 --> 00:49:03,039
Corners, a wicker love seat.

1272
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:05,274

And I'm here because I [bleep]

1279
00:49:17,555 --> 00:49:18,087

00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,568

Yes.

1298
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:49,518
That's right.

1299
00:49:49,587 --> 00:49:53,956
[laughter]

1300
00:49:54,025 --> 00:49:55,791

Punched in the face by her purse

00:49:58,062 --> 00:50:01,497
In front of bob hope and his

00:50:01,566 --> 00:50:03,399
Frickin' 90th birthday party?

1304
00:50:03,468 --> 00:50:03,699
Yes.

1305
00:50:03,768 --> 00:50:05,468
Not.

1306
00:50:05,536 --> 00:50:08,137
Yes, you did.

1307
00:50:08,206 --> 00:50:09,205
Yes, it's true.

1308
00:50:09,273 --> 00:50:11,007
At oneime we we obviously

1309
00:50:11,009 --> 00:50:12,541
Very, very close.

1310
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,176
When I was with roseanne... and

1311
00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:16,312
She's talk about this a lot...

1312
00:50:16,381 --> 00:50:18,114
She had 27 personalities.

1313
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:20,316
Only two of them liked me.

1314
00:50:20,385 --> 00:50:23,919
One of those was a small german

1315
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:24,186
Boy.

1316
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:28,024
[laughter]

1317
00:50:28,092 --> 00:50:30,359
Rosy and I were once

1318
00:50:30,461 --> 00:50:30,826
Inseparable.

1319
00:50:30,895 --> 00:50:31,894
We lived together, we worked

1320
00:50:31,963 --> 00:50:34,663
Together, we even got tattoos

1321
00:50:34,732 --> 00:50:35,031
Together.

1322
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:35,798
You remember.

1323
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:39,402
I got rosy's face tattooed on my

1324
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:39,735
Chest.

1325
00:50:39,804 --> 00:50:42,371
Believe me, it's hard to get a

1326
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,841
Woman to have sex with you when

1327
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:49,545
[bleep] roseanne is staring at

1328
00:50:49,614 --> 00:50:50,046
Her.

1329
00:50:50,114 --> 00:50:50,346
True.

1330
00:50:50,415 --> 00:50:53,282
It's harder to masturbate.

1331
00:50:53,351 --> 00:50:58,220
[laughter]

1332
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:00,556
You know, rosie, it's true.

1333
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:03,426
She had "property only tom

1334

Arnold" tattooe on her hip

1335
00:51:05,063 --> 00:51:06,362

00:51:06,431 --> 00:51:07,296
Prerty owner in california

1337
00:51:07,365 --> 00:51:10,633
[laughter]

1338
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:13,135
Now that I'm allegedly sober and

1339
00:51:13,204 --> 00:51:15,271
We're both in stable

1340
00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:15,771
Relationips...

1341
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,140
[laughter]

1342
00:51:18,209 --> 00:51:20,342
I want you to know, rosie,

1343
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:23,279
There's no reason to be jealous

1344
00:51:23,347 --> 00:51:24,980
Of my wife, ashley.

1345
00:51:25,049 --> 00:51:27,116
She's tall and thin and wasn't

1346
00:51:27,185 --> 00:51:30,986
Born when we were married.

1347
00:51:31,055 --> 00:51:32,888
And I learned fromour mistake.

1348
00:51:32,957 --> 00:51:36,258
I made her sign a prenup.

1349
00:51:36,327 --> 00:51:37,493
That was so good.

1350
00:51:37,562 --> 00:51:37,793
Right.

1351
00:51:37,862 --> 00:51:38,694
[laughter]

1352
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:40,096
I just want to say something

1353
00:51:40,164 --> 00:51:41,597
About yourboyfriend, johnny.

1354
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:42,731
Johnny, I want to say this to

1355
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,599
You, man.

1356
00:51:43,668 --> 00:51:45,267
No matter what, you have to stay

1357
00:51:45,336 --> 00:51:45,968
With this woman.

1358
00:51:46,037 --> 00:51:49,305
She maynot be the perfect wife

1359
00:51:49,407 --> 00:51:51,207
But she's the worst ex-wife on

1360
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:52,341
The planet.

1361
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:52,741
Literally!

1362
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:53,976
[laughter]

1363
00:51:54,045 --> 00:51:56,212
You don't want to be a guy lying

1364
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,746
On his couch with a date and

1365
00:51:57,815 --> 00:52:01,217
Hear how small your dick is on

1366
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:01,784
"Saturday night live."

1367
00:52:01,853 --> 00:52:05,554
And then "the view."

1368
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:07,656
And cnn and al-jazeera.

1369
00:52:07,725 --> 00:52:10,092
She holds a grudge, people!

1370
00:52:10,161 --> 00:52:11,327
You kw what?

1371
00:52:11,395 --> 00:52:12,428
Recently roseanne got in trouble

1372
00:52:12,497 --> 00:52:14,130
For accidentally wishing cancer

1373
00:52:14,198 --> 00:52:17,733
On chick-fil-a customers.

1374
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:18,067
But...

1375
00:52:18,136 --> 00:52:20,669
[laughter]

1376
00:52:20,738 --> 00:52:21,103
Accidentally.

1377
00:52:21,172 --> 00:52:22,404
But you guys can all rela

1378
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:23,906
If she had the power to wish

1379
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:27,810
Cancer on anyone, I would have

1380
00:52:27,879 --> 00:52:30,946
Been [bleep] dead in 94.

1381
00:52:31,015 --> 00:52:33,282
You know, I met roseanne 30

1382
00:52:33,351 --> 00:52:33,949
Years ago.

1383
00:52:34,018 --> 00:52:35,017
You know?

1384
00:52:35,086 --> 00:52:36,218
Remember that?

1385
00:52:36,287 --> 00:52:36,952
That's right?

1386
00:52:37,021 --> 00:52:38,053
Yeah.

1387
00:52:38,122 --> 00:52:38,954
30 years ago.

1388
00:52:39,023 --> 00:52:40,322
First time I saw you perform I

1389
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:41,891
Knew you were one of the

1390
00:52:41,959 --> 00:52:42,258
Greatest.

1391
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:45,928
When I got off stage, you said

1392
00:52:45,997 --> 00:52:49,031
To me, you sure are a funny son

1393
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,432
Of a bitch.

1394
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:51,700
I said thanks.

1395
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:53,569
You want to do some blow.

1396
00:52:53,638 --> 00:52:56,438
We sold the car and disappeared

1397
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:57,439
For three days.

1398
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:58,040
Do you remember that?

1399
00:52:58,109 --> 00:53:02,411
And so began our white trash

1400
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:02,745
Melot.

1401
00:53:02,813 --> 00:53:04,780
For one brief shining moment.

1402
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:07,216
In 1985, roseanneent on johnny

Now, gilbert is famous not so

1432
00:54:18,556 --> 00:54:20,856
Much for his comedy but for

1433
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:24,260
Pissing off more asian people

1434
00:54:24,328 --> 00:54:29,398
Than hiroshima.

1435
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:36,467

Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you

1440
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:57,059
Can hear the sound of my voice.

1441
00:54:57,128 --> 00:54:59,361
This microphone is covered by

1442
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:03,932
The thick layer of pubic hairs

1443
00:55:04,001 --> 00:55:09,338
That shot from between jane's

1444
00:55:09,407 --> 00:55:09,638
Teeth.

1445
00:55:09,707 --> 00:55:12,007
[laughter]

1446
00:55:12,076 --> 00:55:15,744
During the commercial brea,

1447
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:18,580
The produers wipe away the pelt

1448
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:25,649
Of saliva-coated pubes that

1449
00:55:27,058 --> 00:55:28,390
Accumulate upon the mic.

1450
00:55:28,459 --> 00:55:31,460
And each time jane returns to

1451
00:55:31,529 --> 00:55:36,131
The stage, she once again sprays

1452
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:41,136
A carpetf short, pearly hairs

1453
00:55:41,205 --> 00:55:43,806
All over the microphone and the

1454
00:55:43,874 --> 00:55:50,874
Front row of the nauseated

1455
00:55:50,981 --> 00:55:51,480
Dience members.

1456
00:55:51,549 --> 00:55:55,918
So forgive me if my voice is,

1457
00:55:55,986 --> 00:55:57,653
Shall we say, muffled.

1458
00:55:57,722 --> 00:55:59,722

1459
00:56:07,365 --> 00:56:08,230

1463
00:56:15,406 --> 00:56:18,107
Comedy central looked at

- D2 has gotten more work from

1475
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:08,657
Star wars than carrie fisher.

1476
00:57:08,726 --> 00:57:10,125
But tonight isn't about carrie

1477
00:57:10,194 --> 00:57:12,060
Fisher or jeffs or any of

1478
00:57:12,129 --> 00:57:16,031
The other diseased-ridden

1479
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,867
Transients that were forced from

1480
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:20,869
Their shanties and refrigerator

1481
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:22,538
Box dwellings to be here.

[laughter]

1483
00:57:29,647 --> 00:57:33,015
Tonight we honor a monster in

00:57:33,083 --> 00:57:36,251
The entertainment industries.

1485
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:40,956
And like most monsters, she goes

1486
00:57:41,025 --> 00:57:46,028
By one name, and that name is

1487
00:57:46,096 --> 00:57:46,361
Rozilla.

1488
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:53,430

Scaly gray skin.

1493
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:05,981
Emitting a strong disgusting

00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:09,418
Odor of taco grease and ass

00:58:09,487 --> 00:58:09,751
Cheese.

1496
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,753
[laughter]

1497
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:14,556
Her sharp yellow teeth can take

1498
00:58:14,625 --> 00:58:18,460
A man's arm off in one bite if

1499
00:58:18,529 --> 00:58:21,330
You are foolish enough to try

1500
00:58:21,398 --> 00:58:27,302
And feed the beast her mountain

1501
00:58:27,371 --> 00:58:34,371
Of pork crackling and one

1502
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:40,249
Slimfast candy bar.

00:58:40,317 --> 00:58:41,383
Rozilla!

1504
00:58:41,452 --> 00:58:44,720
Stomping through hollywood for

00:58:44,788 --> 00:58:46,889
Decades, breathing fire from her

1506
00:58:46,957 --> 00:58:49,424
Hairy snout, burning bridge

1507
00:58:49,493 --> 00:58:53,395
After bridge, her glowing red

1508
00:58:53,464 --> 00:58:55,097
Eyes striking terror in the

1509
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:57,799
Art of anyone unfortunate

1510
00:58:57,868 --> 00:59:00,602
Enough to look in her hideous

1511
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:00,903
Face.

1512
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:02,971

Crushing and destroying

Everything in her path.

1517
00:59:21,191 --> 00:59:26,261
Stopping only to feed every ten

1518
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:31,400
Minutes and make one sitcom

1519
00:59:31,468 --> 00:59:33,335
Decades ago.

1520
00:59:33,404 --> 00:59:39,107
Her rolls of fat swaying and

1521
00:59:39,176 --> 00:59:42,144
Crashing like a japanese

1522
00:59:42,212 --> 00:59:42,511
Moonami.

1523
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,580
[laughter]

1524
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:53,922
Let me just stop for a second

1525
00:59:53,991 --> 00:59:58,260
And go on the record about

1526
00:59:58,329 --> 00:59:58,594
Moonami.

1527
00:59:58,662 --> 01:00:03,131
[laughter]

1528
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:05,067
One should never spoke about

1529
01:00:05,135 --> 01:00:05,500
Moonami.

1530
01:00:05,569 --> 01:00:08,971
One should never joke about

1531
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:09,338
Moonamis.

1532
01:00:09,406 --> 01:00:15,444
And most important of all, one

1533
01:00:15,512 --> 01:00:16,678
Should never tweet aut

1534
01:00:16,747 --> 01:00:17,045
Moonamis.

1535
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:20,582
[applause]

1536
01:00:20,651 --> 01:00:24,219
But if one were to tweet about a

1537
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:26,388
Moonami, he's probably learned

1538
01:00:26,457 --> 01:00:28,724
His lesson by now and should get

1539
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:35,297
His endorsement deal back.

1540
01:00:35,366 --> 01:00:35,831
[cheers & applause]

1541
01:00:35,899 --> 01:00:38,433
So he won't have to keep doing

1542
01:00:38,502 --> 01:00:44,139
These horrible [bleep] roasts.

1543
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:49,678
Rozilla!

1544
01:00:49,747 --> 01:00:54,049
Or as she's known in tokyo,

1545
01:00:54,118 --> 01:00:58,487
Rozilla!

1546
01:00:58,555 --> 01:01:00,822
[laughter]

1547
01:01:00,891 --> 01:01:03,825
Tonight it's our chance to end

1548
01:01:03,894 --> 01:01:06,628
The reign of rozilla forever.

1549
01:01:06,697 --> 01:01:09,865
And don't forget about the tail.

1550
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:12,734
Powerful enough to sweep an

1551
01:01:12,803 --> 01:01:17,773
Entire ox into her throbbing

1552
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:18,807
Colon.

1553
01:01:18,876 --> 01:01:20,676
People always forget about the

1554
01:01:20,744 --> 01:01:22,010
Tail.

1555
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:24,379
They say, let's get rozilla.

1556
01:01:24,448 --> 01:01:27,482
I say but what about the tail?

1557
01:01:27,551 --> 01:01:28,183
Ey never remember the tail.

1558
01:01:28,252 --> 01:01:30,252
[laughter]

1559
01:01:35,959 --> 01:01:38,960
Those people have paid the

1560
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:39,661
Ultimate price.

1561
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:43,265
And if all else fails, remember

1562
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:44,399
Good people, blame it on the

1563
01:01:44,468 --> 01:01:45,801
Jews.

1564
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:47,869
[laughter]

1565
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:58,280
And now for dumb jokes.

1566
01:01:58,348 --> 01:02:01,116
A drunken farmer stumbles

1567
01:02:01,185 --> 01:02:02,684
Upstairs into his bedroom.

1568
01:02:02,753 --> 01:02:06,455
Waking his wife, roseanne.

1569
01:02:06,523 --> 01:02:08,423
She sees her husband holding a

1570
01:02:08,492 --> 01:02:09,558
Sheep under his arm.

1571
01:02:09,626 --> 01:02:13,295
The farmer yells, "this ishe

1572
01:02:13,363 --> 01:02:15,163
Big I've been [bleep]."

1573
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:16,598
Roseanne says, you idiot.

1574
01:02:16,667 --> 01:02:18,433
These not a pig.

1575
01:02:18,502 --> 01:02:19,501
It's a sheep.

1576
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:24,539
The farmer yells, shut the

1577
01:02:24,608 --> 01:02:25,841
[bleep] up.

1578
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:26,508
I was talking to the sheep.

1579
01:02:26,577 --> 01:02:28,577
[laughter]

1580
01:02:34,017 --> 01:02:34,483
[cheers & applause]

1581
01:02:34,551 --> 01:02:35,183
Thank you.

1582
01:02:35,252 --> 01:02:35,584
Good night!

1583
01:02:35,652 --> 01:02:42,652
[cheers & applause]

1584
01:02:44,628 --> 01:02:46,595
He must have a small dick

1585
01:02:46,663 --> 01:02:47,763
Because he has to act like that.

1586
01:02:47,831 --> 01:02:51,066
Coming up, reanne goes off.

1587
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:58,135
Roseanne, 2012!

1588
01:02:58,342 --> 01:03:00,075
The comedy central roast of

1589
01:03:00,144 --> 01:03:02,043
Roseanne is brought to you by

1590
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:04,679
Klondike and taco bell.

1591
01:03:04,748 --> 01:03:07,349
And now, it's finally time to

1592
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:12,487
Unleash our guest of honor.

1593
01:03:12,556 --> 01:03:13,021
[cheers & applause]

1594
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:18,293
An icon, a superstar, a woman

1595
01:03:18,362 --> 01:03:19,995
Whose balls are as big as her

1596
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:20,362
Mouth.

1597
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:22,330
Roseanne chased the face of

1598
01:03:22,399 --> 01:03:25,066
Television and then changed her

1599
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:25,767
Face.

1600
01:03:25,836 --> 01:03:27,502
She's told so many people to

1601
01:03:27,571 --> 01:03:29,504
Kiss her ass, it could take

1602
01:03:29,573 --> 01:03:31,406
Until the next decades to get it

1603
01:03:31,475 --> 01:03:31,907
Done.

1604
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:33,842
And now tell everybody to go

1605
01:03:33,911 --> 01:03:35,310
[bleep] themselves.

1606
01:03:35,379 --> 01:03:39,581
Ladies and gentlemen, roseanne!

1607
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:46,454
[cheers & applause]

1608
01:03:46,523 --> 01:03:49,224
Hey, thank you.

1609
01:03:49,293 --> 01:03:50,058
Thank you.

1610
01:03:50,127 --> 01:03:52,194
Thank a lot.

1611
01:03:52,262 --> 01:03:59,262
Greetings roseanne-archists.

1612
01:04:01,939 --> 01:04:02,404
[cheers & applause]

1613
01:04:02,472 --> 01:04:04,372
I just want to say to all of my

1614
01:04:04,441 --> 01:04:05,807
Peers, when comedy central calls

1615
01:04:05,876 --> 01:04:08,176
You and tells you they want to

1616
01:04:08,245 --> 01:04:11,146
Honor you, and they will, just

1617
01:04:11,215 --> 01:04:12,747
Hang the [bleep] up.

1618
01:04:12,816 --> 01:04:15,917
I got a dais half full of

1619
01:04:15,986 --> 01:04:17,319
[bleep] losers.

1620
01:04:17,387 --> 01:04:19,487
I've seen people in front of

1621
01:04:19,556 --> 01:04:22,190
Home depot less desperate for

1622
01:04:22,259 --> 01:04:22,490
Work.

1623
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:25,861
[laughter]

1624
01:04:25,929 --> 01:04:28,797
All I know is I better get my

1625
01:04:28,866 --> 01:04:32,367
God damn parking validated or

1626
01:04:32,436 --> 01:04:35,337
Some ass hole is getting fired!

1627
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:37,706
[apause]

1628
01:04:37,774 --> 01:04:41,943
Where the hell are the stars?

1629
01:04:42,012 --> 01:04:45,146
Christ, I must have pissed off

1630
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:46,381
Everybody I've ever known.

1631
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:48,717
I had a number 1 network show!

1632
01:04:48,785 --> 01:04:51,920
I was in a movie with meryl

1633
01:04:51,989 --> 01:04:52,254
Streep.

1634
01:04:52,322 --> 01:04:55,290
And I get amy [bleep] schumer?

1635
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:58,260
[laughter]

1636
01:04:58,328 --> 01:05:00,095
Meryl streep won three oscars.

1637
01:05:00,163 --> 01:05:02,931
This bitch came in fourth on

1638
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,065
"last comic standing."

1639
01:05:04,134 --> 01:05:08,203
[laughter]

1640
01:05:08,272 --> 01:05:10,305
Thank you for your votes.

1641
01:05:10,374 --> 01:05:11,773
But I guess you people are

1642
01:05:11,842 --> 01:05:16,311
The only ones that can take the

1643
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:17,112
Roseanne retort.

1644
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:20,615
Since I am the meanest, baddest

1645
01:05:20,684 --> 01:05:21,082
Bitch on earth.

1646
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:23,752
[cheers & applause]

1647
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:24,119
Thank you.

1648
01:05:24,187 --> 01:05:25,553
[laughter]

1649
01:05:25,622 --> 01:05:27,989
And that is the reason why I'm

1650
01:05:28,058 --> 01:05:30,225
Running for president of ese

1651
01:05:30,294 --> 01:05:31,326
God damn United States of

1652
01:05:31,395 --> 01:05:31,693
America!

1653
01:05:31,762 --> 01:05:37,365
[cheers & applause]

1654
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:39,901
That's right.

1655
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:41,703
Put that in your [bleep] pipe

1656
01:05:41,772 --> 01:05:45,874
And smoke it, you honky [bleep].

1657
01:05:45,943 --> 01:05:49,177
Obama will get my weed when he

1658
01:05:49,246 --> 01:05:53,014
Pries it out of my cold dead

1659
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:53,682
Fingers.

1660
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:54,215
[cheers & applause]

1661
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:58,987
Thank got for jane lynch.

1662
01:05:59,056 --> 01:06:00,355
You are one ferocous bitch.

1663
01:06:00,424 --> 01:06:01,723
I love you so much.

1664
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:04,592
The most revolutionary character

1665
01:06:04,661 --> 01:06:05,727
On television.

1666
01:06:05,796 --> 01:06:07,862
But I hate you because you are

1667
01:06:07,931 --> 01:06:08,163
Thin.

1668
01:06:08,231 --> 01:06:10,966
But I guess I'd be thin too if

1669
01:06:11,034 --> 01:06:13,668
All I ever ate was [bleep].

1670
01:06:13,737 --> 01:06:15,737
[laughter]

1671
01:06:20,811 --> 01:06:22,077
But I love this about you.

1672
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:23,478
I really do.

1673
01:06:23,547 --> 01:06:26,681
Ellen barkin, wow!

1674
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:27,315
I thought you were dead!

1675
01:06:27,384 --> 01:06:33,088
[laughter]

1676
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:33,421
Sweet!

1677
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,390
So glad to see you.

1678
01:06:35,459 --> 01:06:39,961
But I said I wanted that butchy

1679
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:44,599
Blond named ellen, I meant

1680
01:06:44,668 --> 01:06:45,233
Degeneres.

1681
01:06:45,302 --> 01:06:46,568
Carrie fisher, the literary

1682
01:06:46,636 --> 01:06:47,836
Voice of a generation.

1683
01:06:47,904 --> 01:06:49,471
I'm your biggest fan.

1684
01:06:49,539 --> 01:06:52,107
What a career you've had.

1685
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:53,808
Actress, writer, drug mule.

1686
01:06:53,877 --> 01:06:55,076
[laughter]

1687
01:06:55,145 --> 01:06:56,644
Seth green, I don't want to

1688
01:06:56,713 --> 01:07:00,715
Overlook you, which is easy for

1689
01:07:00,784 --> 01:07:02,183
Anyone over 5 feet tall.

1690
01:07:02,252 --> 01:07:04,285
Jan lynch has vibrators bigger

1691
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:05,186
Than you, seth.

1692
01:07:05,255 --> 01:07:06,221
She can use it.

1693
01:07:06,289 --> 01:07:08,857
The only difference is, they

1694
01:07:08,925 --> 01:07:10,825
Can give a woman an orgasm.

1695
01:07:10,894 --> 01:07:15,964
[laughter]

1696
01:07:16,033 --> 01:07:19,401
Wayne brady, you have

1697
01:07:19,469 --> 01:07:22,003
Single-handedly redefined improv

1698
01:07:22,072 --> 01:07:22,504
By scripting it.

1699
01:07:22,572 --> 01:07:25,707
[laughter]

1700
01:07:25,776 --> 01:07:28,676
You can do anything with an

1701
01:07:28,745 --> 01:07:30,278
Audience suggestion.

1702
01:07:30,347 --> 01:07:31,646
Here's one for you.

1703
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:32,881
Get the [bleep] off the stage.

1704
01:07:32,949 --> 01:07:34,949
[laughter]

1705
01:07:40,824 --> 01:07:43,458
Y schumer, thanks for

1706
01:07:43,527 --> 01:07:45,093
Reinforcing the stereotype that

1707
01:07:45,162 --> 01:07:45,994
Women ain't funny.

1708
01:07:46,063 --> 01:07:48,863

An tony jeselnik.

1715
01:07:58,308 --> 01:08:00,909
You know the different between

1716
01:08:00,977 --> 01:08:04,712
Anthony and a gay porn actor,

1717
01:08:04,781 --> 01:08:06,281
Judging but your looks and how

1718
01:08:06,349 --> 01:08:07,115
Much you sucked tonight, none.

1719
01:08:07,184 --> 01:08:11,319
[laughter]

1720
01:08:11,388 --> 01:08:13,054

1721
01:08:13,123 --> 01:08:17,025
Jeff ross is the third-rate

1722

Gilbert gottfried.

1727
01:08:28,105 --> 01:08:30,605
You know, the difrence between

1728
01:08:30,674 --> 01:08:34,776
Gilbert's voice and a sandpaper

1729
01:08:34,845 --> 01:08:35,076
Dildo?

1730
01:08:35,145 --> 01:08:35,410
Do you?

1731
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:38,813
[laughter]

1732
01:08:38,882 --> 01:08:42,650
After 20 minutes, you might

1733
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:43,985
Start enjoying the dildo.

1734
01:08:44,054 --> 01:08:47,655
[lahter]

1735
01:08:47,724 --> 01:08:48,790
And hence the difference.

1736
01:08:48,859 --> 01:08:51,826
And last but not least, tom

1737
01:08:51,895 --> 01:08:52,260

1738
01:08:52,329 --> 01:08:54,395
I'd really like to thank tom for

It was very brave.

01:08:59,136 --> 01:09:01,302
And he was very funny.

1742
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:03,972
But jesus christ, ow much

01:09:09,112 --> 01:09:09,677
For that guy?

01:09:09,746 --> 01:09:11,479
This night has been one of the

1746
01:09:11,548 --> 01:09:13,314
Greatest nights of my life.

1747
01:09:13,383 --> 01:09:14,716
That's not saying shit for my

1748
01:09:14,784 --> 01:09:15,016
Life.

1749
01:09:15,085 --> 01:09:18,920
[laughter]

1750
01:09:18,989 --> 01:09:20,889
No but it was a blast, you

1751
01:09:20,957 --> 01:09:21,189
Guys.

1752
01:09:21,258 --> 01:09:25,393
Thanks to the audience, too.

1753
01:09:25,462 --> 01:09:25,760
Laughing.

1754
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:27,629
There's nothing better than a

1755
01:09:27,697 --> 01:09:28,630
Good laugh.

1756
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:31,032
Nothing on earth.

1757
01:09:31,101 --> 01:09:32,767
And here is the teachabl moment

1758
01:09:32,836 --> 01:09:35,069
Tonight.

1759
01:09:35,138 --> 01:09:39,107
If I can bury my royaling

1760
01:09:39,176 --> 01:09:42,243
Boiling creaseless hatred for

1761
01:09:42,312 --> 01:09:44,245
The likes of tomarnold, maybe

1762
01:09:44,314 --> 01:09:46,281
There's a chance that we can

1763
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:48,416
Have world peace, ladies and

1764
01:09:48,485 --> 01:09:48,783
Gentlemen.

1765

[cheers & applause]

1766
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:54,989
But the truth is, I would gladly

1767
01:09:55,058 --> 01:10:00,128
Give up even that dream if I

1768
01:10:00,197 --> 01:10:00,962
Could just sing.

1769
01:10:01,031 --> 01:10:04,699
