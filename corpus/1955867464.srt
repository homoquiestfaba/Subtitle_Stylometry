1
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:49,515
Mom?

2
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:51,050
Yeah, Monkey Face?

3
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:55,954
Have you, um, told the
Nebraskan family I'm gay?

4
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:59,958
No. Was I supposed to?

5
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:03,929
I don't know. Uh...

6
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:05,998
I was kind of thinking
that while we're here...

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,735
maybe we don't need to make
a real big deal about it.

8
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:12,771
Hmm. So you just...
You want me to lie?

9
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:14,807
No, come on. Not lie.

10
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:18,877
Don, will you help me? I...
You're better with words.

11
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,712
Well, um,

12
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:23,382
you know what, it's-it's
not about you.

13
00:01:23,384 --> 00:01:24,349
Okay? That's fair.

14
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:27,586
It's, uh... It's about Mom
and it's about Grandma.

15
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:31,790
And it's about having a good
time with the Nebraska family,

16
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:36,695
and let's not focus on you, okay?
Right. Okay.

17
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:41,300
So, um, we should tell
the entire family...

18
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:44,403
that you're not
really Jewish too.

19
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:33,418
Everybody just squeeze
in just a little.

20
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,754
There you go.

21
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,756
Okay.

22
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,458
Everybody look at the camera.

23
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,792
I can't get everybody...
Squeeze.

24
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:45,864
Squeeze just a... Say, "Go, Oklahoma
Sooners." Kidding. Kidding.

25
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:48,867
- Ryder, come stand back here by me.
- See, I can't get...

26
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:53,172
The house... The
house is cut off.

27
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:55,674
You ready... ready, Don?
Yeah, Cindy.

28
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:59,511
It doesn't have to be perfect, just make
sure you get everyone in the picture.

29
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:03,081
Why'd you take your pants off?

30
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,521
Um, I'm just going to move this.
Ryder. Ryder, chin up.

31
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,925
There we go. We can
barely get everybody in.

32
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,928
Okay, everybody say,
"Go, Cornhuskers!"

33
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,030
Go, Cornhuskers!

34
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:20,065
Louder! Go, Cornhuskers!

35
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,034
Cornhuskers!

36
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:23,402
Did it go? Not yet, Mom.

37
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:26,939
The beans has to come
out of the oven.

38
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:27,606
Yay!

39
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:33,278
Wait, wait! One more. One
more for-for safety, guys.

40
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:38,684
Come on, guys...

41
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,853
Hey, Ryder.

42
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,958
Come here.

43
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,327
Aikido, huh?

44
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,128
Push me. No, Dad,
I'm not gonna...

45
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,633
Come on, push me. I want to
show you what happens. Push me.

46
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,736
Whoa.

47
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,571
You see? You see what happens?

48
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,940
You come at me, I
redirect your energy.

49
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:08,380
Hey, they can't fight you unless you
give them something to fight against.

50
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:08,780
Okay?

51
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:13,051
Come on, chin up, huh? Come on.
Come on. Okay.

52
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:14,987
Hey.

53
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:17,856
Show me your best aikido.

54
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,864
Great, Joe.

55
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,901
Get that one in there.

56
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,719
Shit! Whoa.

57
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,795
Good, Donny.

58
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,745
Honey, give the guy
a little space now.

59
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,381
- Ryder!
- Whoa.

60
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:17,716
That looks just
like Ginger horse.

61
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:21,186
She still has the picture
from last year on her wall.

62
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,988
Abbey.

63
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:26,124
Looks like you got a fan here.

64
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:30,429
- Are you really from California?
- Mm-hmm.

65
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:32,698
Really? Yeah.

66
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,101
Cool.

67
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:42,307
And... it is done.

68
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:44,309
Yes!

69
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,645
Sign it. There we go. Okay.

70
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,750
Um... how-how do you
spell your name again?

71
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:56,054
It's M...

72
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:57,956
O...

73
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:01,026
L, L...

74
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,094
Y.

75
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:06,331
I'm afraid he's gonna have his
hands full with that one.

76
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,734
All right, now say thank you.

77
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:10,135
Thank you. Come on, now.

78
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:12,738
Let him do a picture for
one of your sisters.

79
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,039
I want a mother and a baby deer.

80
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,375
- Ask nicely, Abbey.
- Please! Please! Please! Can I have...

81
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:19,044
I hope he doesn't mind a bunch
of girls hanging on him.

82
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:22,247
Oh, it'll be good for him.

83
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,306
What's up with his shorts?

84
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,911
Is that a swimsuit?

85
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:55,847
Ryder? What?

86
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:58,016
Is that a swimsuit? No.

87
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:00,819
Is it underwear?

88
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:03,088
They're shorts.

89
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,023
Told ya.

90
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:26,278
You following us, Ryder?

91
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,214
No.

92
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,383
Where'd you get those glasses?

93
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:35,220
Uh, the 1980s.

94
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,825
Ryder!

95
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:43,728
Yeah? Keep talking
so I can find you.

96
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:48,600
Um, hi. I'm-I'm right here. Hi.

97
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:50,368
Gotcha. Yeah.

98
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,804
Can you stand up a second?

99
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:53,205
Um...

100
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:56,374
Ruth told me you had the shortest
pants on she'd ever seen.

101
00:07:56,376 --> 00:08:00,045
So I need to check
them out for myself.

102
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:01,346
Oh.

103
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:07,052
Oh, you have a lot of guts whipping
these out on Grandma's farm.

104
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:11,656
Ryder, I'm sorry, but Molly's refusing
to let anyone tie her shoes but you.

105
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,559
Oh. Looks like you got
your hands full here.

106
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:19,498
Um, okay. I... I can tie 'em
for her if she wants me to.

107
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,398
Yeah.

108
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,200
Being fickle today.

109
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:25,737
Can't talk reason with her.
It's cool.

110
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,475
There we go. There's
the first one.

111
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,281
And there we go.

112
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:38,517
All right now, say thank you.

113
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,218
Let's go to the hay mound
like you asked for.

114
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,755
I want to go with Ryder. Let the
poor guy finish his dinner.

115
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,790
I want to go with Ryder!

116
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,026
Hey, Keith, I-I can take her.

117
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,762
It's all right, Ryder. No, really.
It's okay.

118
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:54,165
Here, come on, Molly, let's go.
All right.

119
00:08:55,968 --> 00:09:00,605
I don't want you climbing those hay bales.
Yeah, we won't.

120
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:24,863
Ryder.

121
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:31,202
Is it true that Uncle Don
isn't really your dad?

122
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,539
What?

123
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:38,009
No, that's weird.
Where'd you hear that?

124
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,212
I don't know.

125
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,449
What, did you dad tell you that?

126
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,024
I don't think your
shorts are weird.

127
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:55,193
I think they're cool.

128
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,164
Well, thank you.

129
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:04,369
Uh, I... I think
they're cool too.

130
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,118
Ryder!

131
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,786
Oh, hey, Molly,

132
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,955
your dad said not
to get up on those.

133
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,091
Where are the baby birds?

134
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:32,530
Uh, do you see... see these
mud things up in the rafters?

135
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,233
Where? It's right there.

136
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,869
Do you see the, uh,
brown like muddy thing?

137
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:41,506
- That-That's the nest right there.
- Oh, I see.

138
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,708
How are we gonna get them?

139
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,245
Uh, Molly, I think we should
kind of leave them alone.

140
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,582
How about you come up here?

141
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,318
Uh...

142
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,221
Why... why don't we go
check out the cows?

143
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:58,156
Uh...

144
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,693
Check out the cows.

145
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:05,397
I...

146
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,966
I mean, I don't
even think the, uh,

147
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:10,969
bales go high enough.

148
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,173
We can do chicken fighting.

149
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,409
Like...

150
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:20,812
Like you getting up on my shoulders?
Yes. Chicken fighting.

151
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:23,782
I don't know if that
sounds safe, Molly.

152
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:26,317
I do it all the time.

153
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,658
Okay, we'll do it,

154
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,995
but you have to promise me that
you're not gonna fall, okay?

155
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:41,299
I know. All right, wrap your
legs around my neck. Ready?

156
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:46,004
I do this all the time. I bet you do.
Okay, here we go.

157
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,565
Daddy!

158
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,100
Molly!

159
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:16,868
Daddy!

160
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,871
Oh, my God! What happened?
Daddy!

161
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,106
Are you hurt?

162
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,875
- I'll take her inside.
- Ryder, are you all right?

163
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:25,210
What happened to her?

164
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,978
I-I don't know. Were you there?

165
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,315
Yeah, I was. I... Does
this happen with her?

166
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:30,882
I... What?

167
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:32,617
It's okay. Just tell
us what you remember.

168
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:35,653
We were just... We were up in the
barn and she started screaming.

169
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:37,956
What were you doing up there?
We were just talking.

170
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,090
Could she have cut herself? I...

171
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,627
I mean, we were sitting on a
hay bale, so I don't think so.

172
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:45,563
She was just screaming.
I... Is that all?

173
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:50,602
You know what, she's gonna be fine, 'cause
Ruth is taking care of her. She's...

174
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:53,304
Don't go anywhere.

175
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,776
I...

176
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:01,546
All right, why don't we all
just go sit down a second.

177
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:03,081
Everything's fine.
Everything's...

178
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,383
Uh, Molly just had
a little spill.

179
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:08,353
Everything's fine. Sorry.

180
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,822
Mom, I... Just sit over here.

181
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:11,956
Don't worry. She's...

182
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:16,327
Just... It's probably
a little, tiny thing.

183
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,135
I...

184
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,206
Um, h-how is she?

185
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,908
She's...

186
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,410
Are you okay? Yeah.

187
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,316
But anyway, she's
settling down, so...

188
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,485
We'll see if we can get
her to stop crying...

189
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,487
long enough to tell
us what happened.

190
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,823
Okay. Uh... Cindy, is she okay?

191
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,624
Yeah, that's what we're
trying to figure out.

192
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:49,561
Do you think maybe I should
go in and take a look at her?

193
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:53,832
Um, you know what, I think
Keith's got it taken care of,

194
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,434
but thank you.

195
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:59,404
Did she stop crying? She's fine.

196
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,307
I'm just gonna go sit with her.
Make sure doesn't need any...

197
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:06,811
Ruth, I said she's fine! Now stay put!
All right.

198
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,784
What is going on?

199
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,120
I have no idea.

200
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,449
You kids, why don't you all go
inside and play, all right? Okay.

201
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:46,317
Go inside.

202
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:52,223
Boys mind moving to another table for
a second? I want to talk to Ryder.

203
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,692
Is Molly all right? I'm
gonna ask you again.

204
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,728
I want you to look me in the eye...
Cindy, a little help.

205
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:01,532
Tell me what happened. Keith, I would be
happy to go in and examine her and...

206
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:02,300
I just did that.

207
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:07,171
Well, so does she... does she have a
laceration or what did you find...

208
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,373
No. We were sitting
on the hay bales...

209
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,776
and she was reaching for a bird's
nest and she just started crying...

210
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:15,313
Has she started her cycle yet?
That's all that happened. I...

211
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:17,916
What? Has she begun
menstruating?

212
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:19,984
Her period. Yeah.

213
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,689
Keith...

214
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,158
She's nine years old.
For Christ's sake.

215
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,528
Well, it can happen very early.
Well, maybe in California...

216
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,897
Oh, Keith. Look, it's
not exactly common,

217
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:37,702
but you said it didn't look like the
blood was coming from a cut and I...

218
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,572
Why don't I just go in and
take a look at her...

219
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:44,108
and we'll get to the
bottom of all this. No!

220
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,377
Keith... Nobody touches her!

221
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:49,914
Please, Keith, you have
to let me examine her...

222
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,015
so that we know how to help her.

223
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:54,118
The last thing I need is you
playing doctor. Okay. Okay.

224
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,423
Keith, look, what's important right
now is Molly's safety, all right?

225
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:00,992
And we are only here...
All of us... to help.

226
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:06,030
You want to help? Keep your
son away from my daughter!

227
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:17,442
Take Mom inside, please.

228
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:24,082
Evelyn, maybe it's a better
idea if you were to go inside.

229
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,186
Don, just...

230
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:32,423
You didn't do anything wrong.
You didn't do anything wrong.

231
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:33,825
I tried. It's okay. It's okay.

232
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:37,128
Just come sit down and talk
to us for a second, okay?

233
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:41,799
All right, Keith is just a
little bit worried about, um...

234
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:44,135
About, uh, Molly right now.

235
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:47,305
Do you think I did something to her?
Oh, no, no.

236
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:50,875
I couldn't have done anything to her.
I know, and...

237
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:52,944
everybody knows that.

238
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:57,615
But, Mom, I... I physically
couldn't do anything to her.

239
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:58,916
Okay, you know what,
this is not...

240
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:02,186
We should tell everybody now.
I mean...

241
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,856
I know these people, and
they're not very accepting.

242
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:09,861
If you say something now, it's
just gonna be one more thing.

243
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,700
You follow your mom's lead here.

244
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,137
Why can't anyone in this
family just tell the truth?

245
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:21,672
Honey, hey... I am going inside!

246
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:24,642
Am I allowed to do that?

247
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,581
Molly's in the bedroom.

248
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,419
Well, why am I so... Hey, Ryder.

249
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:37,121
Can you draw my picture now?

250
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:38,056
Hey, hey.

251
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:40,858
Hey, hey! That's enough! I said
keep him away from my daughter!

252
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,763
We are not using violence around
here, all right? Did he hurt you?

253
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:48,399
Ruth? Ruth.

254
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,003
Go get your girls and tell them
it's time to go home, all right?

255
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:53,204
Cindy... No, Ruth.

256
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:54,672
Don't tell my wife what to do.
Sit down!

257
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:58,876
Don't tell my wife what to do and don't
tell me to leave my own property!

258
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:01,079
Why are you doing this to me?

259
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:03,114
Keep your boy away
from my family!

260
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:06,517
You fucking asshole. Cindy, let's go.
Let's get in the car.

261
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,520
Will you just tell them please?

262
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:10,121
Quiet!

263
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:11,689
This is so stupid!
Just be quiet.

264
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:14,926
Ryder, let's go. Let's get in the car.
Cindy, let's go!

265
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:18,930
Everyone, just cut
it out, all right?

266
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:22,533
Everyone is family!

267
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,637
Cut it out!

268
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,078
Mom, tell them, please.

269
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,882
All right, Ryder, please
just listen to your dad.

270
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:39,784
Let's just calm down.
Fuck you, okay?

271
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,652
Hey, hey, hey! That's not helping!
I don't care!

272
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:44,088
I don't care what you think
you stupid, fucking rednecks!

273
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,023
Ryder!

274
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,025
Ryder.

275
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,695
Ryder!

276
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:27,018
You hiding?

277
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,687
No.

278
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:31,589
What are you doing then?

279
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:35,760
I... I don't know. Not hiding.

280
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,233
All right. Well, we'll
see you around.

281
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:41,826
Hey.

282
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:51,902
See the alfalfa blooming?

283
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:11,188
I brought you some long pants.

284
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:16,227
This warm sweatshirt.

285
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:34,979
Keith can fly off the handle a bit
sometimes, but he really is a good guy.

286
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:38,749
He's an asshole. Oh, don't say that.
He's your uncle.

287
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:41,819
You say he's an asshole
all the time to Dad.

288
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,224
I don't think I do.

289
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,801
So...

290
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,970
let me talk to you a second.

291
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:01,839
Um...

292
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,043
Grandma thinks it...

293
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:10,648
Might be best if you could
stay out here tonight.

294
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,853
Here?

295
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:18,756
Like in here?

296
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:21,692
It's just for one night.

297
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:27,331
That'd give everyone a chance to
get comfortable with you again.

298
00:24:31,504 --> 00:24:34,171
She thinks I did it. No, no, no.
Come on.

299
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:36,607
Why am I the one that
has to stay out here?

300
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:39,610
Because she knows
you're a smart kid,

301
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:41,612
and you're gonna be
the bigger person...

302
00:24:41,614 --> 00:24:44,548
and you can help us fix this.

303
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,188
What am I supposed to
do, hunt for food?

304
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:55,392
Mm. Me and Grandma fixed up a
nice picnic supper for you.

305
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:58,963
You shouldn't have. Well, we got
to get some food in you somehow.

306
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:03,400
You'll be eating off these
leftovers for a week.

307
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:08,739
Why are you talking like that?

308
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:11,475
Like what?

309
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:15,212
You're just talking different
and I think that's weird.

310
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:16,380
I don't think I'm
talking different.

311
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:21,852
You wouldn't normally say "eating off
these leftovers" if we were at home.

312
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:25,656
Why wouldn't I? Because
you don't talk like that.

313
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:27,925
You've been talking differently
since we got here.

314
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:32,363
Oh, I don't think I'm
talking differently.

315
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:35,666
Well, it's annoying. Oh.

316
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:40,170
You sound like an idiot. Well, I...
I think you're making it up, so...

317
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:42,306
I'm not.

318
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,742
There it's not called
"supper," okay?

319
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:50,781
And lunch is definitely not called
"dinner." That's just confusing.

320
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:53,404
Mom. Fuck. Mom...

321
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:56,507
I'm sorry, Son. I thought
you were asleep.

322
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:59,309
I was asleep.

323
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:04,248
I just came to bring
you a blanket.

324
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:08,052
I don't need a blanket.

325
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:14,758
Ryder, you're cold.

326
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,361
No, I'm not.

327
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:28,672
Gosh, this place is a lot
shabbier than I remember it.

328
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:34,712
I used to hide in here when I
wanted to run away from home.

329
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:38,182
Mom?

330
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:39,550
Yeah?

331
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,652
Why does Keith hate you?

332
00:28:41,654 --> 00:28:45,789
What? Why do you say that?

333
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:52,796
Keith and I...

334
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:57,101
See, when Grandpa
gave up the farm,

335
00:28:57,103 --> 00:29:00,671
I got money to keep
going to school...

336
00:29:00,673 --> 00:29:03,540
and, I guess, Keith wasn't
real happy about that.

337
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:08,946
But, at the same time, he got
to inherit all the land, so...

338
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:12,216
And you...

339
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:15,352
You are lucky...

340
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:18,222
because you are...

341
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,058
the only one.

342
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,993
You are the only Monkey Face.

343
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:26,530
I can give you as much as I want.
Mom...

344
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:28,298
Mom.

345
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,869
Stop.

346
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,053
Go back to sleep.

347
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:52,289
Sorry I woke you.

348
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:16,213
Mom? Yeah?

349
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:22,386
What are you doing? Nothing.
Just go back to sleep.

350
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:26,723
Mom...

351
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:30,394
Is that a sleeping bag?

352
00:30:30,396 --> 00:30:31,261
Yeah.

353
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:35,299
Why do you have a sleeping bag?

354
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:40,037
I'm just gonna take a little
nap on the floor here.

355
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:43,240
No. Are you serious?

356
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:46,243
Of course I'm serious.

357
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:48,846
Mom, go back inside.

358
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:54,218
Come on. It'll be like when
we used to go camping.

359
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:58,088
Mom, this isn't funny.
Go back inside.

360
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:02,893
Ryder, I want to
stay here with you.

361
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:06,430
Will you go back in
the house, please?

362
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:13,136
You know, this isn't easy
for me either, Ryder.

363
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:22,980
Just go back to sleep. You
can pretend I'm not here.

364
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,420
Mom?

365
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,557
Yeah, honey?

366
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:39,329
I really don't want you here.

367
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:06,883
Mom? Yeah. Actually,
what time is it?

368
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:08,151
- Can you come outside?
- What?

369
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:12,356
What happened? Just put your
robe on and come outside.

370
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:24,568
What's going on, Ryder?

371
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,738
You... come here.

372
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:48,458
I want you to move
the car around back.

373
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,327
I gonna get something
to take off that pitch,

374
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:52,162
but we got to move it
before Grandma wakes up.

375
00:33:52,164 --> 00:33:55,999
You want me to move it? Yeah. Do you
know where Grandma feeds her cats?

376
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:57,734
Yeah. Okay.

377
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,372
Fuck.

378
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,469
Who would do this?

379
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,180
Are they trying to scare me?

380
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:20,717
See, look.

381
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:25,122
Oh, we're gonna have this
fixed up in no time.

382
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:30,494
Um... there was...

383
00:35:30,496 --> 00:35:34,231
There was motorcycle
tracks near the car.

384
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,970
Who's got a motorcycle?

385
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:47,077
Should we follow them?

386
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:51,882
Mom?

387
00:35:51,884 --> 00:35:55,418
And what would we do then?

388
00:35:56,321 --> 00:36:01,291
Darn it. Okay, Grandma should
be waking up about now.

389
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:03,593
Just keep scrubbing.

390
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:06,029
It's starting to work.

391
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:08,064
I'll come out in a
little and help out.

392
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:10,233
Wait, I have to clean all this?

393
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:12,269
Sorry, honey.

394
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:34,577
Oh. Who could that be?

395
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:43,253
Abbey.

396
00:38:43,255 --> 00:38:47,357
What are you doing here? Did you
walk all the way from home?

397
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,892
I rode.

398
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,830
I see.

399
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:56,533
Did someone come with you?

400
00:38:56,535 --> 00:38:57,701
No.

401
00:38:57,703 --> 00:39:01,271
The other one's for Ryder.

402
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,407
Huh.

403
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:05,842
Is he here?

404
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,911
Uh, yes, he is.

405
00:39:07,913 --> 00:39:11,514
Honey, there's someone
here to see you.

406
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:15,018
Do you want to come
in and get some pop?

407
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,820
It's hotter than heck out there.

408
00:39:16,822 --> 00:39:18,455
No, thanks. I'm fine.

409
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:23,693
Okay. Uh, you-you
remember Abbey.

410
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:26,196
Yeah. Molly's sister.

411
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:31,601
My dad wanted me to say sorry
to Ryder for yesterday.

412
00:39:31,603 --> 00:39:36,806
He wanted to say sorry because he was
angry and he shouldn't have yelled.

413
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:42,112
And he doesn't want Ryder to be
afraid of him or mad at him.

414
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:42,946
He-He, uh...

415
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:47,784
He hopes that Ryder will have
dinner with us today at our house,

416
00:39:47,786 --> 00:39:51,354
and he sent me to pick him up.

417
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:00,697
Just Ryder or...

418
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:04,501
I don't know. You
could call him.

419
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:08,071
But I only brought
one extra horse.

420
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:10,073
Well, we can take the car.

421
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:12,909
Why am I the only one invited?

422
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:15,445
I don't know.

423
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:19,949
Did he say anything else?

424
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:27,490
He said he just wanted you to feel
welcome at our house on your own.

425
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:30,860
But only if you want to.

426
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:36,399
Why don't I give Keith a call?

427
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:38,134
Mom, can I talk to
you for a second?

428
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:39,936
Yeah. Are you sure you
don't want to come in...

429
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:42,639
and have a little something
to drink before you go?

430
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:43,440
No, thank you.

431
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:49,312
He didn't want me to stay long,
so I'll just wait here for Ryder.

432
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:51,114
Mom!

433
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:53,883
Yeah. Coming.

434
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:59,422
I think it was Keith
who wrote on the car.

435
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:03,359
What? Where are you getting that?
Yeah, he's trying to scare me.

436
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:05,562
Can we let today be peaceful?

437
00:41:05,564 --> 00:41:07,030
What's happening?

438
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:10,166
I have to go over there.

439
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:15,538
Are you sure that you want
to go deal with him again?

440
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:18,708
What kind of... What?

441
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,844
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Oh,
honey, what are you doing?

442
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:24,247
You cannot wear those to Keith's house.
Yes, I can.

443
00:41:24,249 --> 00:41:26,783
Honey, be smart. I
am being smart, Mom.

444
00:41:26,785 --> 00:41:30,220
Listen, I know you are set on not
listening to your mother right now,

445
00:41:30,222 --> 00:41:31,254
but you do not know
Keith the way I do.

446
00:41:31,256 --> 00:41:33,345
This is not the time to
make a statement. This

447
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,458
is the time to try to
smooth things over.

448
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:40,864
I am not lying anymore. Will you
get that through your head?

449
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,434
The Ryder I know is
smarter than this.

450
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,108
Go.

451
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,449
You know how to ride? Yeah.

452
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:05,421
We should go now. Dad said
to be home by dinnertime.

453
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:25,375
Don't pull on the reins.
Just follow.

454
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,729
I thought that there was a
road leading to your house.

455
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:48,364
There is.

456
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:50,066
This way is faster.

457
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:52,201
Dinner will be ready soon.

458
00:42:56,273 --> 00:43:00,577
Jesus Christ. Is it
always this hot out here?

459
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,193
Whiskey, come on.

460
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,199
Whoa.

461
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:25,602
Whoa. Whoa.

462
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:26,803
Whoa.

463
00:43:26,805 --> 00:43:28,972
There's the house.

464
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:04,874
Whoa.

465
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:07,844
Hey.

466
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:16,653
Give me your rein.

467
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:22,558
All right. Come on.

468
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:31,901
Hey, Daddy. You guys
are just in time.

469
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,507
How you doing there, Ryder?

470
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:39,709
All right.

471
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,013
Oh, come on.

472
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:47,350
You've got to shake my
hand better than that.

473
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:50,720
I feel like I'm
shaking a dead fish.

474
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:54,390
No, it's all... It's
all in the grip.

475
00:44:54,392 --> 00:44:56,125
Oh, like...

476
00:44:56,127 --> 00:44:59,462
There you go. All right.

477
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,498
You're welcome in
my home, Ryder.

478
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,068
Any time you need.

479
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,969
All right?

480
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,539
Well, all right.

481
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:12,942
Okay, come on inside. Girls
are waiting for you.

482
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:17,280
You almost ready, Ruth?

483
00:45:17,282 --> 00:45:19,716
Yeah. I was just
waiting on you men.

484
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:22,085
Gotta put this salsa
on the table...

485
00:45:22,087 --> 00:45:24,721
and we are ready to go.

486
00:45:24,723 --> 00:45:27,523
Hey, Mr. Ryder. Where
are your folks?

487
00:45:27,525 --> 00:45:28,958
Uh, they're back at
Grandma's house.

488
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,295
Oh, well, that was nice of
them to let us have you today.

489
00:45:32,297 --> 00:45:33,896
Run and get seven
settings, honey.

490
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:37,066
- We're having tacos.
- I hope you like tacos.

491
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:37,867
Yeah. No, that sounds good.

492
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:41,070
Probably nothing compared to
what Grandma's been feeding you.

493
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:42,472
It smells great.

494
00:45:42,474 --> 00:45:45,408
It's kind of a serve
yourself sort of deal.

495
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:47,343
Ready for Molly? I think so.

496
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:48,244
Molly! Dinner's ready!

497
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:51,647
Hey, why don't you take the
head of the table today, Ryder.

498
00:45:51,649 --> 00:45:53,049
Ruth, you there.

499
00:45:53,051 --> 00:45:55,218
Ryder, can I get you some pop?

500
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,152
Uh, sure.

501
00:45:56,154 --> 00:45:57,687
Girls, you all want pop?

502
00:45:57,689 --> 00:45:59,222
Yeah.

503
00:45:59,224 --> 00:46:03,126
Okay. Everyone
give me your cups.

504
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:04,827
Is Molly still in her room?

505
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:07,897
I called her in. Molly!
We're waiting on you.

506
00:46:07,899 --> 00:46:09,832
Thank you. Mm-hmm.

507
00:46:12,337 --> 00:46:14,370
There she is.

508
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,307
Hi, Molly.

509
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:49,172
Let's eat.

510
00:46:49,174 --> 00:46:51,808
Yum.

511
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,678
So, Ryder, I was meaning
to tell your mom...

512
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,781
about this, um, winery...
I guess you'd call it,

513
00:46:58,783 --> 00:47:00,016
that just opened east of town.

514
00:47:00,018 --> 00:47:04,654
I read about it in the paper. It seems
like they've got quite the operation.

515
00:47:04,656 --> 00:47:05,087
Really?

516
00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:07,156
Yeah, and I was thinking
to myself, you know,

517
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:11,294
Cindy's family always brings
wine when they come into town.

518
00:47:11,296 --> 00:47:13,095
I'll bet they'd enjoy this.

519
00:47:13,097 --> 00:47:15,464
Yeah, that-that sounds good.

520
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:20,069
They ever let you taste wine?
'Cause you're not 21 yet, are you?

521
00:47:20,071 --> 00:47:23,539
Uh, no. I'm 17 but,
um, yeah, like,

522
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:27,810
you know, at dinner they'll let
me have, like, a glass of wine.

523
00:47:27,812 --> 00:47:29,645
Hey, Ryder.

524
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:33,216
Which of these girls
looks the oldest to you?

525
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:34,016
What?

526
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:36,319
Forget about who's
actually the oldest.

527
00:47:36,321 --> 00:47:38,554
Which one looks the oldest?

528
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:40,656
I-I don't know.

529
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:44,126
Well, you don't have
to get it right.

530
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:49,899
Uh, I...

531
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:51,734
Molly, I guess.

532
00:47:51,736 --> 00:47:53,736
Okay.

533
00:47:53,738 --> 00:47:56,372
Now, which one... Uh, which
one's the next oldest?

534
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:58,507
I-I really don't know.

535
00:47:58,509 --> 00:48:00,409
Just guess.

536
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:04,947
Okay, um...

537
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:08,184
I guess one, two,

538
00:48:08,186 --> 00:48:10,519
three, four.

539
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:15,992
Fair enough.

540
00:48:15,994 --> 00:48:20,463
- Guess we have to get you
some new clothes then, Abbey.

541
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:27,703
Hey, Ryder. We heard
about your big news.

542
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:32,708
You, uh, won some sort of
trophy at your school?

543
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:35,278
Mmm.

544
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:39,849
Yeah, um, it was...

545
00:48:39,851 --> 00:48:42,251
It was a songwriting
competition.

546
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:44,954
It was last year.

547
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,890
Basically, wait... How
do you know about that?

548
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:48,791
Grandma must have told us.

549
00:48:48,793 --> 00:48:52,828
She gives us little updates about
you guys every once in a while.

550
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:54,964
But, um... Yeah it was, uh...

551
00:48:54,966 --> 00:48:56,866
You... Tell me again,
you wrote a song?

552
00:48:56,868 --> 00:49:00,269
I wrote a song and then, um,
I played guitar with it.

553
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:02,461
- And it was part of, uh, some

554
00:49:02,473 --> 00:49:04,674
school thing, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

555
00:49:04,676 --> 00:49:09,345
See, that is so neat to me that schools
out there have things like that.

556
00:49:09,347 --> 00:49:10,746
Hmm.

557
00:49:10,748 --> 00:49:13,950
I guess it's pretty cool.
Yeah, so...

558
00:49:13,952 --> 00:49:17,486
Well, maybe we'll have to
have you sing it for us.

559
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:20,990
Sure. I...

560
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:22,758
Like-Like right now? Or...

561
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:26,162
Oh, uh... Don't you
need your guitar?

562
00:49:26,164 --> 00:49:30,700
I mean, I could sing it a capella...
if you want.

563
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:35,004
Well, um... okay.

564
00:49:35,006 --> 00:49:37,773
Yeah, that-that would be
nice, if you'd like to.

565
00:49:37,775 --> 00:49:40,910
I didn't know we were gonna
get serenaded today too.

566
00:49:40,912 --> 00:49:44,814
All right, now, everyone, no eating
while Ryder's singing, okay?

567
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:50,152
So the, uh, the song
is called <i>All The Way.</i>

568
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:57,259
♪ I bite my fingers
till the skin is raw ♪

569
00:49:57,261 --> 00:50:02,631
♪ He goes through leather
like a table saw ♪

570
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:07,069
♪ We eat each other
whole every night ♪

571
00:50:07,071 --> 00:50:13,642
♪ And spit it out until
the skin is light ♪

572
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:19,782
♪ And I don't know who was
wrong and who was right ♪

573
00:50:19,784 --> 00:50:25,388
♪ But someone spiked the
meat loaf last night ♪

574
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:30,359
♪ Oh, I'm easy on your eyes

575
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:35,031
♪ But never on your mind

576
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:39,869
♪ Oh, and I'll wipe
that pain away ♪

577
00:50:39,871 --> 00:50:44,907
♪ Oh, and I'll wipe
that pain away ♪

578
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:49,045
♪ All the way

579
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:53,382
♪ All the way

580
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:58,387
There's a...

581
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:01,357
There's-There's another verse.
And, uh...

582
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,560
That was very nice.

583
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:08,964
Wasn't that nice, Keith?
Oh, very. Yeah.

584
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:13,202
Well, Ryder, it
certainly is a treat...

585
00:51:13,204 --> 00:51:16,038
every time we get to have
you back on the farm,

586
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,374
even if it only is
for a couple days.

587
00:51:18,876 --> 00:51:23,079
Gosh, sometimes I get so sad thinking
about you and your mom and dad...

588
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:25,247
all the way out there
with no family around.

589
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:30,286
Oh, well, I... I mean, we have
a lot of friends, so, it's...

590
00:51:30,288 --> 00:51:32,721
You got any special ladies
out there in California?

591
00:51:32,723 --> 00:51:36,559
Grandma told us that you're not
seeing that Julie girl anymore.

592
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,728
Oh, no, no. We
were just friends.

593
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:42,198
Oh, come on. I bet you've
gotta fight them off...

594
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,066
with a voice like that.

595
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:48,804
I... I don't know.

596
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:51,974
Come on, be honest. Are
you a heartbreaker?

597
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:55,244
Or are you just teasing,
like your mom used to do?

598
00:51:55,246 --> 00:51:58,380
Keith. I'm taking to Ryder.

599
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:06,655
Not-Not-Not really.

600
00:52:06,657 --> 00:52:08,891
Why not?

601
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:14,830
I don't know. I...

602
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:17,533
- Can-Can I use the bathroom?
- Of course.

603
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:20,836
It's over there? Mm-hmm.
Just on your right.

604
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,920
Thought we lost you there. No.

605
00:52:37,922 --> 00:52:40,089
Sorry, I didn't know if
you were done or not.

606
00:52:40,091 --> 00:52:42,224
No, that's okay. Sweetheart,
can you grab that?

607
00:52:42,226 --> 00:52:43,192
Can I help with anything?

608
00:52:43,194 --> 00:52:44,827
Oh, no. Don't worry about it.
I got it.

609
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:46,695
Girls, can you please help
me gather up the place mats?

610
00:52:46,697 --> 00:52:50,766
Molly, why don't you show Ryder your room?
Show him your new trophy.

611
00:52:50,768 --> 00:52:52,935
Okay.

612
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:08,484
You all right, Ryder?

613
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,153
Yeah.

614
00:53:11,155 --> 00:53:13,322
What's the matter?

615
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:15,658
Nothing.

616
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:30,706
Abbey, leave them alone.
Come here!

617
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,204
Sorry, I...

618
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:07,710
Is that, uh... Is
that your trophy?

619
00:54:07,712 --> 00:54:09,044
Yeah.

620
00:54:09,046 --> 00:54:11,080
It's cool.

621
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,788
Hey, um, are...

622
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:22,424
Are you okay?

623
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:25,394
Like-Like from yesterday?

624
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,831
Yeah.

625
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:59,328
So, pick a number. One,
two, three or four.

626
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,830
Um...

627
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:05,100
Four.

628
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:10,839
Pick purple, black,
orange or yellow.

629
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:15,044
Black.

630
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:21,417
Pick green, blue, white or red.

631
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:26,555
Uh, blue, I guess.

632
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:30,359
Um...

633
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,565
What does it say?

634
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:42,237
What? What does it say? Wait...

635
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:43,939
Kids having fun?

636
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:46,408
Being awful quiet in here.

637
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:50,112
Hey, Ryder. Why don't you come
outside with me for a second?

638
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,247
Come on.

639
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:19,408
Did your mom ever tell
you why she left here?

640
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:27,383
She, uh... She got
into UCLA, right?

641
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:32,721
She left because she thought
she was better than all this.

642
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:41,029
Is that what you think?

643
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:45,033
No. I...

644
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,703
I hope not.

645
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:54,843
You strike me as someone
who's never held a gun.

646
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:58,180
Am I right?

647
00:56:58,381 --> 00:57:00,482
Yeah. I-I... No. I mean,

648
00:57:00,484 --> 00:57:03,552
I've held one before.

649
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:05,053
Yeah?

650
00:57:05,055 --> 00:57:07,389
Did you fire it?

651
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:08,690
No.

652
00:57:08,692 --> 00:57:12,928
Do you think you'd know
how if you needed to?

653
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:13,962
I-I don't know.

654
00:57:13,964 --> 00:57:16,231
See, Ryder, I was thinking
yesterday after the picnic,

655
00:57:16,233 --> 00:57:17,900
there are a few things
you should learn...

656
00:57:17,902 --> 00:57:19,802
they probably aren't
teaching you in California.

657
00:57:19,804 --> 00:57:23,405
You look like you might about curl up
in a ball if someone threatened you.

658
00:57:23,407 --> 00:57:25,874
I mean, if someone really
threatened you with a weapon.

659
00:57:25,876 --> 00:57:30,913
I think the least I could do is
show you how to use one of these.

660
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:33,148
Go on.

661
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:40,956
Now push this button here.

662
00:57:43,761 --> 00:57:45,761
This is the clip.

663
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,931
See the ammo inside.

664
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:51,667
You're fully loaded right now,

665
00:57:51,669 --> 00:57:55,404
but you can't fire it
until you cock it.

666
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:03,345
So if I pulled the trigger
right now it would go off.

667
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:04,813
Yep.

668
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:08,417
But it might knock you over
if you held it like that.

669
00:58:08,419 --> 00:58:12,354
You hold it back here,
in a holster behind you.

670
00:58:12,356 --> 00:58:13,755
Now get your finger
off the trigger!

671
00:58:13,757 --> 00:58:16,158
You never hold your finger
on the trigger. Right.

672
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,494
You hold your finger against
the side of the gun...

673
00:58:18,496 --> 00:58:21,129
until you're aimed
and ready to shoot.

674
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:21,897
All right.

675
00:58:21,899 --> 00:58:25,567
Now, you draw with your right hand
and step forward with your left.

676
00:58:25,569 --> 00:58:26,502
One fluid motion.

677
00:58:26,504 --> 00:58:28,370
Bring your left
hand up to meet it.

678
00:58:28,372 --> 00:58:30,339
Hold it with two hands.
There you go.

679
00:58:30,341 --> 00:58:33,141
Your left arm is in front
to protect your vitals,

680
00:58:33,143 --> 00:58:36,011
and your right arm
will take the kick.

681
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:38,313
N-Now do I put my
finger on the trigger?

682
00:58:38,315 --> 00:58:41,450
Yes, you would, but
don't do it yet.

683
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:44,253
Let's say you fired
off eight rounds...

684
00:58:44,255 --> 00:58:46,221
and he's still coming at you.

685
00:58:46,223 --> 00:58:46,855
You want to reload.

686
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:49,113
If you were really
firing, the last bullet

687
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:51,393
would have pulled the
slide back like this.

688
00:58:51,395 --> 00:58:54,596
Now pop out the old clip.
That button.

689
00:58:54,598 --> 00:58:58,934
Keep your ammo here.
Put the new clip in.

690
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:02,771
Press down that slide
lock right there.

691
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:06,942
Now you're ready to go.

692
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:11,013
That fucker's gone.

693
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:17,753
When you have a gun,

694
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:20,956
you don't have to be scared.

695
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:25,928
You're ready to
protect yourself.

696
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:28,397
Protect your family.

697
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:37,205
Now this is a sign of
trust between us, Ryder.

698
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:42,277
Do you trust me?

699
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:46,949
Yes.

700
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:51,587
Are you saying that 'cause you
think it's what I want to hear?

701
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:54,056
Or do you really trust me?

702
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:58,627
I-I don't know.

703
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,302
All right.

704
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:10,305
Now give me the gun.

705
01:00:33,896 --> 01:00:37,299
I'm glad we got to
speak today, Ryder.

706
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:42,671
Molly will be right out.

707
01:01:16,706 --> 01:01:19,241
Aren't you coming?

708
01:01:31,055 --> 01:01:33,522
Do you know how to
get to Grandma's.

709
01:01:33,524 --> 01:01:36,558
Of course I do.

710
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:38,960
Come on.

711
01:01:38,962 --> 01:01:40,896
Let's go.

712
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:13,428
Is your dad mad at us?

713
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,766
Molly. No.

714
01:02:21,971 --> 01:02:24,606
Why was he acting like that?

715
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:28,410
Like what?

716
01:02:28,412 --> 01:02:30,512
Like at lunch.

717
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:33,081
I don't know.

718
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,716
Molly, I'm serious. I mean...

719
01:02:34,718 --> 01:02:36,451
What's going on?

720
01:02:36,453 --> 01:02:40,655
Wasn't he making you
feel uncomfortable too?

721
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:45,360
I don't want to talk
about that anymore.

722
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,969
Is this the way we came?

723
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:58,006
I don't remember going through
this when we came here.

724
01:02:58,008 --> 01:03:00,575
You know where you're going?
Yep.

725
01:03:00,577 --> 01:03:04,713
What... Isn't the
house back that way?

726
01:03:04,715 --> 01:03:08,316
But there horses
need a drink first.

727
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:51,359
Molly?

728
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:54,896
What... Hey, what are you doing?

729
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:56,932
Going swimming.

730
01:03:56,934 --> 01:03:58,967
I thought you were
taking me home.

731
01:03:58,969 --> 01:04:03,271
I am taking you home, right
after we go swimming.

732
01:04:03,273 --> 01:04:06,308
Molly, I'm-I'm not
going swimming.

733
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:07,642
Why not?

734
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:11,713
Because I don't have a swimsuit.

735
01:04:11,715 --> 01:04:14,216
You have shorts.

736
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:16,084
Molly, what are... No! Hey!

737
01:04:16,086 --> 01:04:17,419
Don't... M-Molly! Hey!

738
01:04:17,421 --> 01:04:20,021
Don't you like swimming?

739
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:22,924
D-Don't... Will you not
go any farther, please.

You're not gonna take them off?
No.

751
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:03,531
You can't swim with them.

752
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:05,267
Yes, I can.

Can you wear them? Yep.

755

I don't know. What?

Hey, hey. No, no.

can't get them wet. Okay?

01:13:43,852 --> 01:13:47,655
You're a good kid.
And you're honest.

879
01:13:47,657 --> 01:13:50,191
Your mom raised you right.

880
01:13:50,193 --> 01:13:52,026
And I trust you'd
never do anything...

881
01:13:52,028 --> 01:13:54,962
but be a good father
figure to Molly.

882
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:05,239
I don't wanna go on
about it, but...

883
01:14:05,241 --> 01:14:08,376
I hope we can let this rest now.

884
01:14:11,548 --> 01:14:13,347
Ryder.

885
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:17,518
Yeah, we can.

886
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,720
Okay. Good, good. So...

887
01:14:19,722 --> 01:14:22,423
we're all a family
and we're gonna...

888
01:14:22,425 --> 01:14:25,626
We're gonna go on being a
family no matter what.

889
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:28,996
- Wouldn't have it any other way.
- All right.

890
01:14:28,998 --> 01:14:32,233
Well. Good, then.

891
01:14:35,538 --> 01:14:38,840
Hey, did you show Ryder your chicken
fighting down at the river today?

892
01:14:38,842 --> 01:14:42,276
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

893
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:45,546
Did he know how to play?

894
01:14:45,548 --> 01:14:46,814
Uh-uh.

895
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:49,951
He didn't?

896
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:54,355
Didn't your mother teach
you that one, Ryder?

897
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:58,993
She used to love that
game when we were little.

898
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:03,264
She was always asking me to go
down to the river with her...

899
01:15:03,266 --> 01:15:06,000
to go chicken fighting.

900
01:15:08,403 --> 01:15:10,638
Cindy?

901
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:15,009
What is this, uh... What
is chicken fighting?

902
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:19,113
How about you, Ryder?

903
01:15:19,115 --> 01:15:22,817
You like chicken fighting too?

904
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:28,222
Did I just miss something here?

905
01:15:30,492 --> 01:15:34,462
Your grandma always thought
that game was my idea.

906
01:15:35,664 --> 01:15:37,999
But it was really yours,

907
01:15:38,001 --> 01:15:40,468
wasn't it, Cindy?

908
01:15:48,477 --> 01:15:51,312
Supper's probably
waiting on us, Molly.

909
01:15:51,314 --> 01:15:54,048
Give him back his glasses.

910
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:12,066
What was that all about?

911
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:32,787
Mom?

912
01:16:42,197 --> 01:16:44,498
Mom, look at me.

913
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:56,644
I'm sorry.

914
01:16:56,646 --> 01:16:59,614
- It's my fault.
- It's my fault.

915
01:16:59,616 --> 01:17:03,784
I was just so... I was so young.

916
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:07,254
I didn't know what I was doing.

917
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:11,192
I didn't know what I was doing.

918
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:20,201
We can go home tomorrow.

919
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:23,037
And we don't ever have
to talk about this...

920
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:25,806
or think about it again.

921
01:17:31,213 --> 01:17:33,681
Okay, honey?

922
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:40,054
You did nothing wrong.

923
01:18:43,785 --> 01:18:47,722
You keeping an eye
on the clock, buddy?

924
01:18:47,724 --> 01:18:49,523
Yeah.

925
01:18:50,926 --> 01:18:54,829
Hey, I'm gonna make, uh,
one more pass through.

926
01:20:09,604 --> 01:20:12,206
