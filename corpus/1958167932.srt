00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,443
[audience cheering]

2
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,403
[upbeat music playing]

3
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,668
[Amy] Thank you so much, LA.
Please, thank you.

4
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,463
LA!

5
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,049
[audience cheering]

6
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,054
Don't make me like you.

7
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,643
Oh, my God, there's, like,
some young people up front.

8
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,520
Like how... how old are you?

9
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,606
- [woman] Twenty-seven.
- [Amy] Twenty-seven.

10
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,399
Oh... remember?

11
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,234
[audience laughing]

12
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,986
Remember 27?
[sighs]

13
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,823
God, you're so cute
and everything's still up high and...

14
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,578
You're wearing heels. You're gonna...
Someday, you're gonna...

15
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,247
These are gonna be your heels. Okay?

16
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,749
[audience laughing]

17
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,460
Right here. To me, these are heels now.

18
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,921
Okay?
There's an orthopedic insert in here.

19
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,508
- What's your name?
- [woman] Libby.

20
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:35,095
"Libby." That's so cute.
Twenty-seven. Libby. Oh, my God.

21
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,265
Do you drink? Are you a drinker?
Little bit? Okay.

22
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,852
Here's the kind of drinking I've been
doing lately, okay, on this tour.

23
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,522
Like, yesterday is the only day
I didn't drink,

24
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,941
and I drank. Do you know what I mean?

25
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,151
[audience laughing]

26
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,778
[Amy] You know?

27
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,533
You don't count it
'cause it was less than five.

28
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,619
Started early, yeah.

29
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,246
So I don't count that, yeah.

30
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,498
'Cause I, uh...

31
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,959
I used to black out, Libby.

32
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,545
Last week. And, uh...

33
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,258
Nothing good ever happens
in a black-out, right?

34
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,345
I've never woken up, like,
"What is this Pilates mat doing out? Wow."

35
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,389
[audience laughing]

36
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,144
"Who cleaned?" No.

37
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,437
No.

38
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,986
Wake up with a potato skin
like an eye patch.

39
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,323
Dried ice cream on my neck.

40
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,449
I hope!

41
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,703
[audience laughing]

42
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:46,749
[audience whistling]

43
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,585
[Amy] Can't drink like we used to, huh?

44
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,630
I just turned 40. Again.

45
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,034
- [audience cheering]
- Thank you.

46
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,552
Thank you. Keep doing it.
Keep doing it.

47
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,638
And, uh, you know,

48
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,974
I've always preached confidence for women.

49
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,310
You know, to feel great in your own skin.

50
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,563
Right? And then the day I turned 40,
I took my skin

51
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,732
and I got it lasered.

52
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,483
Hm...
- [audience laughing]

53
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,820
[Amy] So, Libby, what laser is...

54
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,408
is they shoot a laser

55
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,076
at your face.

56
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,122
Okay, you pay them money, a lot of money,

57
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:30,001
and in return they shoot you
in the face with a laser beam.

58
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:36,466
The thing that in the <i>Ocean's Eleven</i>
bank heist movies, they're trying to avoid

59
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:38,676
to get the money.

60
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,304
You, instead,
put your face in front of them.

61
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,394
It's incredible what laser does.
What happens is...

62
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,064
you turn blood-red,

63
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:56,611
but then the skin falls off your face.

64
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:58,987
But then,

65
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,950
six-to-eight weeks later...

66
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,955
you look exactly the same.

67
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,457
[audience laughing and applauding]

68
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,293
[Amy] Amazing, right?

69
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,673
It's just incredible what they can do now.
Just...

70
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,677
I got filler in my face.

71
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,429
Uh, then they dissolved it,

72
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,933
'cause, as it turns out,
I was already full.

73
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,187
I... [chuckles]

74
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,192
Tom... Tom, you're doing "A" cam, right?

75
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,654
Can you get in close on this
in case people don't know? So, my face...

76
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,241
Someone, just because
they were wearing a white lab coat,

77
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:46,286
talked me into needing
more volume up here.

78
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,578
Okay?

79
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,708
It already looks like
I'm storing nuts for the winter.

80
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,126
[makes munching sound]

81
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,924
I came home,

82
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,135
scared the shit out of my husband.

83
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,805
Just bleeding. Just needle marks.

84
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,349
He's like,
"Holy fuck, were you in a fire?"

85
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,852
[audience laughing]

86
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,979
I'm like, "I wasn't not in a fire."

87
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,484
"Wait until my laser kicks in, babe.
You're gonna be hard as a rock."

88
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,616
I got lipo, and then I,

89
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,660
in record time, gained the weight back.

90
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,458
Lipo is the laziest thing
I've personally ever done.

91
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,546
That was my way of saying,
"I would rather have major surgery...

92
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,842
than be a little hungry once."

93
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,386
[audience laughing]

94
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,228
That's the truth. I'm never hungry.

95
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,356
I never let it get to that, you know?

96
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:04,238
I feel it coming about an hour away
and that's when I combat it. You know?

97
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,951
You know, I'm doing my best.

98
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,662
I had a baby. Not bad for a year. Right?

99
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,748
[audience cheering]

100
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,752
It's been three.

101
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,754
[audience laughing]

102
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,548
And a half. But, uh...

103
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,387
You ever get handed a new insecurity
when you weren't really expecting it?

104
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,349
Someone will just kinda mosey up
and hit you with it.

105
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,432
They'll just...

106
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,268
"Hey, you know who you look like?"

107
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,686
I go, "No, thanks."

108
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,272
[audience laughing]

109
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,900
"I'm not open to that feedback right now.
Thank you."

110
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,154
It's never somebody good, right?

111
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,532
It's never a model.

112
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,867
It's always, like, their fucked-up cousin.
"Look!"

113
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,916
[sighs] I just got handed a new insecurity
by a trusted friend.

114
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:00,128
It's when you're feeling safe
that someone will hit you with something

115
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,422
they thought you'd already
accepted about yourself.

116
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,134
You know, she goes,
"You know how you're short-waisted?"

117
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,927
I was like, "Yes! What?"

118
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,012
[audience laughing]

119
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:15,435
She's like, "You know the way your ass
goes all the way to your armpit,

120
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,103
and you don't really..."

121
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:26,821
"Like an ostrich! Cool! Okay, good! Good!"

122
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:27,904
"I love that!"

123
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,412
But I just got hit with
a new insecurity that

124
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,414
rocked me.

125
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:40,751
I was getting acupuncture
to see if I could still feel, and, uh...

126
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,506
He's working on me,
and with so much enthusiasm,

127
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,592
like it wasn't a big deal, he says to me,

128
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,927
"Did you know that you have a hump?"

129
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,763
[audience laughing]

130
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,145
I said, "My lovely lady lumps?"

131
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,903
[audience cheering]

132
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,196
"Check it out!" Right?

133
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,825
He's like, "No, you have a hump."
And I do.

134
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,911
I'll show you. On the back of my neck,

135
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,622
okay, don't miss out on this shot, Tom.
Get in here.

136
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,415
Okay? Check that out.

137
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,835
I... Someone goes, "Oh, yeah!" Yes, I do.

138
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:29,383
I'm humped, okay.
Like a whale, or a camel.

139
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,136
Or that guy who loves Notre-Dame.

140
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,220
I...

141
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:39,393
found out in my 40s that
all this time I've been rocking a hump.

142
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,857
I said, "What do we do?"

143
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,068
He goes, "I don't think
there's anything we can do."

144
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,446
"So you just needed me to know?"

145
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,117
He goes, "It's called a 'widow's hump.'"

146
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,787
I'm like, "I'm all set
with info about that. Thank you."

147
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:08,839
He said, "Well, just try holding
your neck back further."

148
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,759
[audience laughing]

149
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:21,060
"Like this?" He said, "Yeah, that's good."
"Okay, yeah. Less hump. Is this...?"

150
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:28,192
So, I know a lot of you
are sitting there thinking,

151
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,152
"Do I have a hump?" And...

152
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,549
I don't want you to be shy.
You're a little em...

153
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,075
Just feel free. Just go in there and feel.

154
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,202
The way you'll know, is when you

155
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,496
run your finger down your neck,

156
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,374
you'll run into a hump.

157
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,418
[audience laughing]

158
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:56,095
So that's my little secret insecurity.
Okay?

159
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:57,847
I'm humped.

160
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:02,059
We all have some
little secret insecurity, right? Like...

161
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,194
I just met someone, and I don't think
their insecurity can be a secret.

162
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,108
Okay, now,
this story really happened. Okay?

163
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,445
My husband and I
were invited to a dinner party.

164
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:16,032
Very last minute. We think we were
a last-minute fill-in. Not a big deal.

165
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,202
We go to the party, and it was
at this really rich guy's house.

166
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,496
We never met him before.
Right before we go in,

167
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,290
our friend who invited us says,

168
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,208
"Oh, just so you know,

169
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,503
he's blind, but it's a secret."

170
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,589
[audience laughing]

171
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,928
I'm like, "What the fuck
are you talking about?"

172
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,266
"From who?"

173
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,355
She's like,
"Well, um, he doesn't acknowledge it,

174
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,441
and everyone around him
acts like it's not happening."

175
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,905
I'm like, "You can be that rich
that you're just not blind?"

176
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,451
Turns out, yeah. So...

177
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,454
I was glad she gave me a heads-up,

178
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:06,540
you know, 'cause, like,
I have no impulse control.

179
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,876
In ten seconds in his house,
I would have been like,

180
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,961
"Are you fucking blind?"

181
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,718
I was glad she gave me a heads-up,
'cause...

182
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,430
Sometimes people give you a heads-up
for things that aren't necessary,

183
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,600
and it makes everything awkward. You know?

184
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,484
Someone will be, like,
"Okay, and he's Black."

185
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,230
"Should I change the music?"
What are you talking about?

186
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,109
You don't have to warn me about,
you know...

187
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,403
Or, "And she's gay."
"Oh, should I eat her out?"

188
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,780
- "Is that...?"
- [audience laughing]

189
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,957
It's a weird warning, but, uh...

190
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,711
But, "He's blind and it's a secret"?
Thank you.

191
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,213
A "secret blind" is a heads-up I want. So...

192
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,050
So we go in and...

193
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,636
he's blind. Okay?

194
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,348
He's in the kitchen,
because he's cooking.

195
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,270
And you could tell... He's looking up.

196
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:12,022
He says, "Hey, great to meet you.
No shaking hands. Covid."

197
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,941
And we're like, "That's why."

198
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,318
- Uh...
- [audience laughing]

199
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:21,073
And he offers us a drink.

200
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,742
I said, "Sure, yeah. Great."

201
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,577
So I went over to grab a glass,

202
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,789
and I am not kidding you,
I turn around, and he's like this.

203
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,293
[audience laughing]

204
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,881
[audience clapping]

205
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,637
All night, shit like this is happening.

206
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,057
People just clean it up and act like
it didn't happen. Keep it moving.

207
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,978
Dinner took nine years to cook.

208
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,108
We're all sitting around
pretending to eat and, uh...

209
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,861
I'm keeping the conversation going.

210
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:02,990
I'm trying to fill the air, but I kept on
talking about vision by accident.

211
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,161
You don't realize how much
you talk about it, you know.

212
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:11,081
I... I actually said this sentence,
okay, to a blind person.

213
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,626
I said, "Is anyone watching <i>The Watcher</i>?"

214
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,127
[audience laughing]

215
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,420
What?

216
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,927
That's a double-blind. I fucked up.

217
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,893
His girlfriend was there.

218
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:34,480
I said, "How long have you guys
been seeing each other?" Fucking fuck.

219
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,275
"Smelling her?" Um...

220
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,987
This rich guy.

221
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,574
In his late 50s.
Had a very young girlfriend.

222
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:46,909
Very young.

223
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,328
I'm like,
"Let me guess, she's an old soul."

224
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,998
Right? Isn't that the story, LA?

225
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,962
Twenty-three-year-old pussy,
but what an old soul on the gal.

226
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,801
Wait until you get a load of her soul!
Yeah.

227
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,462
And I don't think it's cool to make fun
of blind people.

228
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,016
I just don't think
you can be a secret blind.

229
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,646
Okay? And if there's gonna be one group
of people that's really mad at me,

230
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,898
that feels like a safe one.

231
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,192
[audience laughing]

232
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,781
"We're gonna get you!" Are you?

233
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,534
[audience laughing]

234
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,003
I shouldn't be baiting the crowd
like this. I really shouldn't.

235
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,755
People ask, "Is this a dangerous time
for comedians?"

236
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,759
You know, I don't know if you saw,
Chappelle got tackled on-stage.

237
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,470
And just all this crazy shit's
been happening.

238
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,306
When they ask, I'm like, "Yes."

239
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,892
"I'm on the front lines every night."

240
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:59,356
Like, no. Not if you're me, you know.

241
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,318
Maybe if you're them, you have these spry...

242
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,904
I'm like, "My people are like me. Okay?"

243
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:06,947
We're tired.

244
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,116
[audience laughing]

245
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:13,245
[chuckles] Nobody's tackling anybody.
We're all too tired.

246
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,717
I don't know about you, here's where I am
with my energy level lately.

247
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,337
If I sit down and realize
I didn't grab the remote...

248
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,631
[audience laughing]

249
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,634
I'll just sit there...

250
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,971
for as long as it takes. Right?

251
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,975
There's one of us in every relationship.
The piece of shit. Right?

252
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,060
You just sit there.

253
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,562
You wait for your partner to come in.

254
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,565
"Hey, can you grab the remote?"

255
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,072
It's like, "Have you been sitting here
for two hours?"

256
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:53,994
Goes to sit down.

257
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,913
"And also can you get me another drink?
Oh."

258
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,088
What else is going on in my life?

259
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,174
Oh, I have a little boy.

260
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,927
[audience cheering]

261
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,011
A little boy.

262
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,931
Yeah. I don't know if I'm a good parent.

263
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:17,351
I think I'm just getting used to failing.

264
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:20,062
Is that what being a parent is? Just...

265
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,898
Just bombing. It's like stand-up.

266
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,693
You know, you just get used to it.
I just...

267
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:29,863
I don't think anybody's failed
as hard as I did, as quickly, though.

268
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,491
Do you know what I named my son?

269
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,660
Let me walk you through it, okay?

270
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,537
Listen up, Libby. So...

271
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,583
Our son's first name is Gene.

272
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:45,796
Okay? Gene. Basic.
We named him after my husband's mom,

273
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,966
who passed away,
which is very sad, of course.

274
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,887
[audience laughing]

275
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:57,182
But also, to not...

276
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,351
have a mother-in-law...

277
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,896
[audience laughing]

278
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,234
It sounds like somebody has a lucky hump.
So...

279
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,072
Very sad, of course.

280
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,493
My husband's last name is Fischer.

281
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:20,164
That's why I, Amy, didn't take it.

282
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,249
[audience laughing]

283
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,597
It's... You might be a little young
for this reference, Libby, but...

284
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:34,011
Google "Amy Fisher" when you get home.
And, uh, it's not good. So...

285
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,141
Then came his middle name, and that's...

286
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,435
That's where I fucked up. Okay? I, uh,

287
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:46,648
I wanted to pay tribute to my favorite
comedian, my good friend, Mr. Dave Attell.

288
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,151
- All right. So I...
- [small cheer]

289
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,236
That's about right. So I...

290
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,489
[audience laughing]

291
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,658
Truly my favorite comedian of all time.

292
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,703
So we gave him the middle name "Attell."

293
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,582
So I was about a month
into being a new mom,

294
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,667
sitting on the couch when I realized

295
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,961
that I've named my son...

296
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,964
"Genital Fissure."

297
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,217
[audience laughing]

298
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,231
Anybody ever fuck up like that?
I don't think so.

299
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,778
We changed his middle name
as soon as we realized.

300
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,007
I think it's better. We changed it
to "Fingerbang Shit-Snatch."

301
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,825
Is that better? Or...

302
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,747
Is anybody here pregnant?
Any pregnant people here?

303
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,415
Oh, congratulations.

304
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,542
Are you keeping it?

305
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,585
[audience laughing]

306
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:52,089
Hey, we're in one of the states
where we still have a choice. Right?

307
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,257
[audience cheering]

308
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,427
Can you believe it?

309
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,932
In Wisconsin,
I didn't want to ask the crowd.

310
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,059
You know? It's, like, yeah.

311
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,271
They could always drive to Illinois.
Just recommending. But, uh...

312
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,025
Yeah. People love giving
pregnant women advice, don't they?

313
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,278
They love it. They just love it.

314
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:17,361
The whole time I was pregnant, I have
this one friend, she'd always tell me,

315
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,741
She's like,
"You have to do prenatal yoga."

316
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,743
"It really helps with the birth.
Prenatal yoga."

317
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,998
So I immediately signed up
for a C-section.

318
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,125
[audience laughing]

319
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,003
Because, fuck that, okay?

320
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,799
If I'm ever in downward dog, I fell.

321
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:42,347
Upward humpback Jew.
That's my resting pose, right here.

322
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,478
I did. I had a...

323
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,856
I had a C. Came out the sunroof.

324
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,191
And, uh...

325
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:58,906
You know, some women feel like they failed
if they don't give birth vaginally.

326
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,366
And the only thing that really comforts me

327
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,536
is my still-perfect pussy. It's really...

328
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,788
[audience cheering]

329
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,084
No, it's not. It's not good. Trust me.

330
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,632
Things still shift, you know what I mean?
I don't...

331
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:21,762
I don't know what it is. When I take
a bath, I feel like I fill up. You know?

332
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,096
I just kinda...

333
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,435
floating in there. Just...

334
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,025
Just kind of
squishing around after for hours.

335
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:42,699
But they tell you,
no matter how you give birth,

336
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,827
C-section, vaginal... They almost
never come out of your asshole.

337
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,913
- They tell you...
- [audience laughing]

338
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,833
The doctor is very serious
right after you give birth.

339
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,087
They say, "Now, listen,
you cannot have sex for six weeks."

340
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,547
"Okay? No sex. Six weeks."

341
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,220
I'm like, "Okay, let me write that down.
Six..."

342
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,929
I'm like,
"Oh, wait, remember when you just, uh,

343
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,932
Wolverine'd my FUPA open?"

344
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,142
[audience laughing]

345
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,986
How about six years?

346
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,533
That's when I think
I'll want to do that again.

347
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,538
"His foot got caught on my intestines
on the way out."

348
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,707
"When can I get raw-dogged from behind?"

349
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,127
[chuckles] These...

350
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,628
"I need dick!"

351
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:37,713
Like, who's...?

352
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,090
"Five weeks?" Yeah, okay.

353
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:49,599
I had this awful condition while I was
pregnant called hyperemesis gravidarum.

354
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,561
Severe nausea and vomiting,
the whole pregnancy.

355
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:56,440
I was so relieved when I was diagnosed,
it was like six months in.

356
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:59,276
I was like, "Okay, we know what it is.
What do we do?"

357
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,654
And they explained to me,
"We haven't been able to study it

358
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,324
because it only happens to women."

359
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,993
[audience laughing]

360
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,248
[audience cheering]

361
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,630
"But if your husband wants,
we have chewable Viagra."

362
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,551
Which is a real product.

363
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,137
Because, sometimes,

364
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,806
it's scary to take a pill.

365
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,892
[audience laughing]

366
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,859
"I wanna get hard,

367
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,569
but I don't want to take a pill."

368
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,158
[audience cheering]

369
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,831
"Okay, you can chew it. Okay."

370
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,716
I have severe endometriosis. Very painful.

371
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,512
A debilitating disease.
About 10% of women have that.

372
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:12,516
There are no studies.
But if your dick curves slightly one way,

373
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,643
they got you, bro!

374
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,273
Any dick-mergency,
the Paw Patrol is on the way!

375
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,572
Got a hysterectomy this year.

376
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,743
Wanted to lose those last three pounds,
am I right, ladies? [chuckles]

377
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:35,996
No.

378
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:39,000
I had to get it removed
because of my endometriosis.

379
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,168
And, uh...

380
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:45,507
It was a big surgery. They took out
my uterus, they found cysts in my ovaries.

381
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,926
They found a tumor in my appendix.

382
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,011
But the craziest thing they found

383
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,806
was that my liver was fine.

384
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,684
[audience laughing]

385
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,861
It's such a fun New York moment
right after that surgery.

386
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,865
I was walking around
feeling sorry for myself,

387
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,367
and there was this group
of big meathead dudes.

388
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,911
One of them recognized me and goes,

389
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,289
"Hey! Amy Schumer!"

390
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,415
"How you doing?"

391
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,085
I was feeling kind of honest.
You know, I was like,

392
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,047
"Not great. I just had my uterus removed."

393
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,383
[audience laughing]

394
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,805
And his response
made me feel so much better.

395
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,765
He goes,

396
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,435
"Oh, no!"

397
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:39,936
[audience laughing]

398
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,570
"You should get it back!"
I'm like, "That's not..."

399
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,033
"That's not really how that works,
but thank you, sir."

400
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,579
I feel so much better
after getting that surgery,

401
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,748
the laparoscopy and all that. I, uh...

402
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,124
If you have endometriosis...

403
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,877
The only way I can describe
how much better I feel,

404
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,795
is like if you ever saw <i>Willy Wonka,</i>

405
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:10,175
you know those old people that are all
in that bed, 69-ing all day, like...

406
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:11,885
[audience laughing]

407
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,136
[moans]

408
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,555
And the one grandpa gets the golden ticket

409
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:18,266
and he gets out and clicks his heels.
Like, that's me.

410
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,434
You know...

411
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:23,021
That's how much better I feel.
I'm like a new person...

412
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,397
I'm a new mom.

413
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,316
You know, I can run with my son now.

414
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,068
I don't, but, uh...

415
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:30,819
You know.

416
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,573
I, uh...

417
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:39,204
We had a medical emergency
in the audience last weekend on the road.

418
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,874
It was very strange.
I learned a lot about my crowd.

419
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:46,503
It was in the balcony.
This guy was having a seizure.

420
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,880
He's fine. You know, I...

421
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,842
I didn't follow up. But I'm assuming,
you know, I would have heard.

422
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,512
No, he's fine. But, uh...

423
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:59,224
But in the moment it was scary.
We had to turn the house lights on.

424
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,394
This is when I learned about my crowd,
because I was like,

425
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,854
"We need a doctor! Go!"

426
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:06,648
Not one.

427
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,234
[audience laughing]

428
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,319
The entire audience, not one doctor.

429
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,990
So I'm like, okay, "Nurses!"

430
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,784
And there were like 40 nurses
but they were all hammered.

431
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,328
[audience laughing]

432
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,417
They're like, "We're not on-call.
Fuck you!" I was like, "Fair."

433
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,588
Thank God for our nurses. You know?

434
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,464
- [audience cheering]
- Yeah.

435
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:32,548
Fuck yeah.

436
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,433
I really couldn't...
couldn't sleep after that.

437
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,810
It was just... It was alarming, you know?

438
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,313
It was like...
I mean, I can never sleep anyway.

439
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,023
I'm such a bad sleeper.

440
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:52,527
Whenever I say that, somebody is like,
"Have you tried melatonin?"

441
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,696
[audience laughing]

442
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:02,996
"CBD?"

443
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,873
I'm like, "I need heroin, okay?"

444
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,793
Fucking melatonin. Get outta here.

445
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:12,922
I mean,
they told us how we can get better sleep.

446
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,842
We all know the advice, right? They said,

447
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:17,885
"If you want the best night
of sleep of your life,

448
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,471
an hour before you go to bed,

449
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,306
turn your phone off."

450
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,142
What do we all say?

451
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,060
"No."

452
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,604
[audience laughing]

453
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:30,732
"That's crazy."

454
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,803
"Oh, you don't care about sleep?"

455
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,320
I care about sleep
more than anything in the world.

456
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,614
I'll take any pill, I'll have any surgery.

457
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:42,827
"Why not just 15 minutes
before you go to bed, power down?"

458
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:43,995
"Fuck you!"

459
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,081
[audience laughing]

460
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,794
I need to be staring
into the abyss of my phone

461
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,589
as I'm falling asleep, okay?

462
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,594
Plus, I need to be reading something.
I'm eating. [scoffs]

463
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,680
[audience laughing]

464
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,019
They did do one study on women.

465
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,562
You may have read about this.

466
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:13,817
They found that social media
is harmful to young girls.

467
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,151
Thank you, NASA.

468
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:18,822
We know.

469
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:20,990
Right?

470
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:25,495
Since we've been in town, I saw this group
of girls, maybe 12 years old.

471
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,247
These little girls were taking selfies.

472
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,499
You know, and they knew their angles.

473
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,169
Know what I'm saying?
Maybe some people don't know. Like...

474
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,504
Like, your angles... Okay.

475
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:37,590
Like, see how my leg looks
if you look straight on?

476
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,717
Get a shot of this, Tom.

477
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,593
Look at that. Disgusting.

478
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,637
[audience laughing]

479
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,931
What is that, Gollum? That's heinous.

480
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,643
Now watch this. Bam!

481
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,353
Whoa!

482
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,480
Everyone's hard.

483
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,606
[audience laughing]

484
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:59,070
And they knew their good side,
these 12-year-old girls.

485
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,406
They see so many pictures of themselves.

486
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:04,367
Like, I'm 41. I know my angles.

487
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:05,451
Okay?

488
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:08,329
At this point,
the photographer gets in a tree,

489
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,583
and I dig a deep trench.

490
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,712
I kinda get down there... That's me.

491
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,926
That's where I shine, you know?

492
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,720
Twelve years old.

493
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,598
Remember when we were 12?

494
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,310
Somebody took a picture of us once a year.

495
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,395
[audience laughing]

496
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:34,689
Right?

497
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,859
Maybe twice if we had a school dance.
Right?

498
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,737
Somebody's dad had a camera.
It was like,

499
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,616
"Whoa! I didn't know Lindsay was rich!
Her dad has a whole camera!"

500
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,996
We didn't know our angles.
They'd say, "Cheese!"

501
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,432
And we'd all just kinda...
[grunts]

502
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,333
Looked like we were shitting ourselves.

503
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,631
Because we were.
Because all we ate was dairy.

504
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:03,760
Right?

505
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:08,681
We didn't have oat milk, or almond milk,

506
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,558
or Erewhon.

507
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,852
[audience laughing]

508
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,938
We had whole milk.

509
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,483
And we drank it with every meal.

510
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:23,363
You'd have a grilled-cheese sandwich

511
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,907
with a cup of milk.

512
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,623
Our skin was bad,
we were farting all over the place.

513
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:35,041
It was disgusting.

514
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,880
But we were happy, goddamn it.

515
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,259
[audience cheering]

516
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,342
Right?

517
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,015
I don't know, Libby.

518
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,062
Twenty-seven.

519
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,357
What would it be like to be 27 now?

520
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,526
You grew up seeing so many more
pictures of yourself.

521
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:06,823
Here's a good thing. You are definitely
vaccinated for chicken pox.

522
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,032
Probably don't even know it.

523
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,909
Remember our vaccine for chicken pox?

524
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,246
Is that your mom
would push you in a room...

525
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,914
[audience laughing]

526
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,878
with neighbors who had them, just...
[groans]

527
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,228
She'd go, "Get it!" That was our vaccine.

528
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,841
"Go get it!"

529
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,305
Horrifying.

530
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,101
You're definitely vaccinated for HPV.

531
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,436
And I feel bad for you.

532
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:41,232
You're missing out on an important
character-building experience.

533
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,568
[audience laughing]

534
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:49,240
We all had it.
All my friends, we all got it.

535
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,075
Admitted it to each other after college.

536
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,911
We're all crying. "I'm a whore!"

537
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,704
[mock crying]

538
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:57,081
"I'm gonna have to tell
all my future partners!"

539
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,333
Never told one person.

540
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,585
[mock crying]

541
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,677
We all got it.

542
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,805
I'm still really close with my girls
from high school.

543
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,350
I feel so lucky about that friendship.
Yeah.

544
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,936
It's the best.
I realized though...

545
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,647
that we text each other
like we're fucking.

546
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,944
Like, I text them in this intimate way
I would never text my husband. You know?

547
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,612
I'll be like...

548
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,906
"Text me the second you're home safe."

549
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,536
"Home." "Thank God."

550
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,622
[audience laughing]

551
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,461
"Your ass in those jeans tonight,

552
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,713
what?"

553
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,510
"When can we be together again?"

554
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,474
If Chris ever got
a text like that from me,

555
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:59,060
he'd think I was fucking kidnapped.
He'd call the police.

556
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,400
I was out drinking
with my girlfriends one night.

557
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,484
And, uh...

558
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,737
We were talking about
how lazy we've gotten, sexually.

559
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:14,200
And, uh, I was like,
"What if we text all of our husbands

560
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:16,244
'Do you want to have
phone sex right now?'"

561
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:19,580
We were crying we were laughing so hard.

562
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,208
We thought... We thought it was so funny.

563
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:27,880
And we did it, and we got such different
responses from these dudes.

564
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,844
My husband wrote back the fastest, okay,
and he just wrote,

565
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,429
"Fuck you."

566
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,514
[audience laughing]

567
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,726
Okay.

568
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,813
That's fair. It's what I deserve.
You know?

569
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,069
And my friend Jess' husband,
we declared the loser

570
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,530
because he just wrote, "Too tired."

571
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,949
[audience laughing]

572
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,456
We're such hypocrites. We were pissed.
And then, uh...

573
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,335
My friend Caroline's husband said, uh,

574
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,819
"When the kids go to bed." Not bad.

575
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,591
But the winner, we declared,
was my friend Andrea's husband,

576
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:14,260
who just immediately called.

577
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,344
Hello?

578
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,555
[audience laughing]

579
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,281
Joke was on her. She had to have
phone sex with her husband that night.

580
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,947
She answered like she was
in a horror film. "Hello?"

581
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:45,541
I love my girls. They're all
teachers and nurses from Long Island.

582
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:48,252
and they, uh... Yeah. Teachers.

583
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:51,714
- [audience cheering]
- Holy shit. Thank you, teachers.

584
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,135
They came with me
when I hosted the Oscars.

585
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,554
They were on the red carpet with me,
and it was...

586
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:02,100
It was so fun having them there.
And they were so excited.

587
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,184
At first.

588
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,685
[audience laughing]

589
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:08,397
Just... We just get used to shit so quick,
don't we?

590
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,359
These girls, at first
they're so starstruck. They're like,

591
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,946
[gasps] "There's Ryan Reynolds!"
And, "Is that Taylor Swift?"

592
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:19,033
And then 20 minutes later, my friend Jess
walks over smoking a cigarette.

593
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,910
She's like, "Meryl Streep's chatty."

594
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:23,746
[audience laughing]

595
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,289
[exhales]

596
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,755
This bitch. You know?

597
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,301
I love my girls. We all got married.

598
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,345
I can't believe we got married. We, uh...

599
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:40,721
All of us.

600
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,325
I've only been married for five years,

601
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,183
but this is what I think
marriage is so far.

602
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:47,186
I think marriage is finding someone

603
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,647
who can stand you.

604
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,732
[audience laughing]

605
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,026
Is that too romantic?

606
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:58,573
Find someone who can fucking stand you.

607
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,953
Especially during the pandemic
when we were all just home, just...

608
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,331
Staring at each other.

609
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,836
Judging. Waiting to criticize each other.

610
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,174
"You gonna chew like that?"

611
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,259
[audience laughing]

612
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,887
"No. No."

613
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:25,254
"Didn't know if you're trying to wake the
neighbors 'cause it's so loud. But no."

614
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,024
My husband...

615
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,027
We were fighting...
What was our last fight?

616
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,653
Oh, we went to see <i>Top Gun.</i>

617
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:38,905
Anybody see <i>Top Gun?</i>

618
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,031
[audience cheering]

619
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,991
It was cute, right? I was impressed.

620
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:45,161
Do you know that Tom Cruise
does all his own Scientology?

621
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,413
[audience laughing]

622
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,592
I dragged him there.
I wanted to see it in the theater.

623
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:02,595
You know, we were fighting.
I don't remember what about.

624
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:05,306
I remember I was right. But, uh...

625
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,101
But... This is why I like being married
because it's, you know,

626
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,938
he said, "I don't even
want to be near you right now."

627
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,374
Before we were married,
I would have been like...

628
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,568
But I'm like, "Can I have your wallet?
I still want to see <i>Top Gun.</i>"

629
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,820
[audience laughing]

630
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,156
Kinda throws it to me. He leaves.

631
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,200
I just walked to the movie. I'm like,
"Fuck this guy. I'll see him at home.

632
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,327
[mutters]

633
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,333
Half a block later,
he's back walking next to me.

634
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,421
Gave him his wallet.
We didn't talk about it. Just moved on.

635
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,800
Gotta keep it moving. Right?

636
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,344
Keep it moving.

637
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,430
But he can stand me.

638
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,894
Do you guys know who Hilaria Baldwin is?

639
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,063
[audience laughing]

640
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,066
I'm saying it wrong. I'm sorry.

641
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,026
[Spanish accent] Hilaria...

642
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,112
Baldwin.

643
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,114
[normal accent] Okay.

644
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:08,869
So, I just can't wrap my head
around this story.

645
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:12,665
If you don't know who I mean,
this is Alec Baldwin's wife. Okay?

646
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:16,544
And I met her years ago, backstage at <i>SNL</i>.

647
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:19,547
Alec was like,
"I want you to meet my wife."

648
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,341
And I saw her, and I said,

649
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,551
"No, thank you."

650
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,095
[audience laughing]

651
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,056
I'm trying to hang on to my self-esteem.
Okay?

652
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,393
She is a tiny Disney princess,

653
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,602
and I...

654
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,939
look like Ben Roethlisberger
from most angles.

655
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,237
She came over.

656
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,364
[Spanish accent]
"I'm Hilaria from <i>Espania</i>."

657
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,785
[normal accent]
Very thick Spanish accent. Okay?

658
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:50,869
From Spain.

659
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:56,167
You might have seen her on a morning show
doing a cooking demonstration

660
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,878
where she had trouble remembering
how to pronounce the word

661
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,088
[Spanish accent]
"How you say, 'cucumber'?"

662
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,385
[normal accent] She was wearing a dress.
They said, "Where's your dress...?"

663
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,971
[Spanish accent] "I don't know
if you have it, It's from Zara."

664
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,560
[normal accent] They have a
von Traap-amount of children, and, uh...

665
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,645
[audience laughing]

666
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,900
And they named them all, I'm not sure,
but, very Spanish names

667
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:25,613
like <i>Jamón</i>, and <i>Croqueta</i>, and Flamenco.
You know?

668
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:32,578
And all of this would be
fine and beautiful, except...

669
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:34,567
[Spanish accent] ...that Hilaria

670
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:36,957
from <i>Espania</i>...

671
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:42,380
[normal accent]
...is actually Hillary from Boston.

672
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,923
[audience laughing]

673
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:51,472
This woman is in no way Spanish.

674
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,642
Her parents are not from Spain.

675
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,937
No one in her life is from Spain.

676
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,356
You went, "What?"

677
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:04,068
Did you think I was just doing
a really racist Spanish impression...?

678
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,070
You're like, "Wow. Wow."

679
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,033
So, I'm not trying to bully a sociopath.
I have a point. Okay?

680
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,202
[audience laughing]

681
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:18,124
So I think what had happened was...

682
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,544
I think she went to Spain.

683
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,591
Because, again, I cannot tell you
how much her family is not from Spain.

684
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:31,429
They were early settlers in the U.S.

685
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,765
I'm not fucking with you,
they were on the <i>Mayflower</i>.

686
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,311
That's how much this chick is from Boston.
But...

687
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,606
I think what had happened was,
she went to Spain.

688
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:46,902
And I've been lucky enough to go to Spain.
Some of you have. It's great, right?

689
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,613
Don't you love it? I loved it, too.

690
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:52,825
But Hillary from Boston

691
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:58,706
fucking loved it.

692
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,089
[Spanish accent]
"I am going to be from it!"

693
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,654
[normal accent] Did you know
you can just decide where you're from?

694
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:25,107
Like, on my driver's license,
it says that I am from Splash Mountain.

695
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,193
[audience laughing]

696
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,489
Isn't that great?

697
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,327
Libby, do you ever go on vacation
and have a good time?

698
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,622
- Where? Where'd you go?
- [Libby] Mexico.

699
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:40,539
Mexico?

700
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:41,624
You're from there.

701
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,628
Enjoy. Enjoy.

702
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,298
So here's my point, okay.

703
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:50,966
I actually have a point. Okay.

704
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,051
My point is...

705
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:56,680
that all evidence points to this woman,
since she met her husband,

706
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,975
has straight-up pretended
to be from Spain.

707
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,311
And her husband

708
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:05,189
shot someone. Now, stay with me!

709
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,272
[audience laughing]

710
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:08,526
Stay with me.

711
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,403
My point is...

712
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,323
neither of them give a fuck.

713
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:18,494
Find someone who can stand you.

714
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,579
[audience cheering]

715
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,967
My husband.

716
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,468
The love of my life.

717
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,095
We have sex sometimes.

718
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:38,930
And, uh, married people,

719
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:43,435
have you found this? We've found the best
weekday to have sex is always tomorrow.

720
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,521
[audience laughing]

721
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,012
Is that when you guys have sex?

722
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,109
"We ate today. Maybe we won't...

723
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,989
eat tomorrow.
That'll be a big day for us. You know?"

724
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,576
"Yeah, we'll definitely
fuck each other tomorrow."

725
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:03,496
And then you do it.

726
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,166
And you act like you
went on some excursion.

727
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,543
Like you were bowling.

728
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:10,754
"That was fun. We have to remember
we like doing that."

729
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,923
[audience laughing]

730
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,009
"We should bowl more. Why don't we bowl?"

731
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:18,721
If it were up to me,
I'd bowl once a week. You too, yeah?

732
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,431
Tomorrow. Tomorrow.

733
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:23,892
My husband's amazing.

734
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,270
He always turns the lights on

735
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:27,938
right before we have sex. You know?

736
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,649
I shut 'em off, and he puts 'em on.

737
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:36,071
Finally, he's like, "Why are you so shy?
I love your body. All your scars."

738
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,323
"You're beautiful." You know?

739
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,533
And I was like, "Oh."

740
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,829
"You're so cute.
You think I don't want you to see me."

741
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,914
[audience laughing]

742
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,299
"Baby, my laser is about to kick in."

743
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:03,140
My husband actually just said these words
to me before we had sex. He said,

744
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,059
"Do you need me to go down on you?"

745
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,482
"Do I need you to?"

746
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,027
I'm like,
"No, I just saw <i>Top Gun</i>. Thanks."

747
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,112
[audience laughing]

748
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:25,204
It's hard to have sex with your spouse.
I'll say it.

749
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,792
Because that's your family.

750
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:37,049
It's like, we just had
Thanksgiving together.

751
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:38,967
I'm not gonna suck your dick.

752
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,886
You're my emergency contact
for Christ's sake!

753
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,971
[audience laughing]

754
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,767
That's disgusting.

755
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:55,150
Can't talk dirty to each other anymore.
We know each other too well.

756
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,111
You know, I'm like,

757
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,279
"I'm gonna..."
He's like, "No, you're not."

758
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,080
"No, I'm not."

759
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,545
"I want you to come all over..."
"No, you don't. No."

760
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,923
"No, I don't."

761
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,218
We do a lot of roleplay.

762
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,929
But I always pick the same role.

763
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,806
You know, I'm always like,

764
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,142
"Okay. I...

765
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,269
am in a coma."

766
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:32,354
[audience laughing]

767
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:41,488
"Go."

768
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,574
[audience laughing]

769
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,209
I love him so much.

770
00:45:58,505 --> 00:45:59,505
I do.

771
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,302
My husband is on the autism spectrum.

772
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,763
And... Thank you. Thank you.

773
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,807
It used to be called Asperger's,

774
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:12,060
but then they found out
that Dr. Asperger had Nazi ties.

775
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,605
Hate when that happens, right?

776
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,149
Like some of our neighbors lately. Okay?

777
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:20,444
Can we please love Jews?
There aren't that many of us left. Okay?

778
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:22,529
[audience cheering]

779
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,827
So, yeah, he's on the autism spectrum.

780
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,413
And, uh...
It's called Autism Spectrum Disorder.

781
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:37,920
And getting diagnosed has been so helpful
to our family and to him,

782
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:40,130
in helping us communicate.

783
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,883
Making his life better, our life better,

784
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:46,470
and he's so fucking cool and brave
that he's down to be open about it,

785
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:48,472
when there's such a stigma,
when it's so stupid.

786
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:51,058
because he's my favorite person
in the whole fucking world,

787
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,601
other than my son, of course.

788
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:54,686
[audience cheering]

789
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,485
People don't know much about autism.
They hear and go,

790
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,320
"Oh, does he love to count?"

791
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,405
[audience laughing]

792
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,411
"Should we drop
a bunch of straws on the floor and...

793
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:14,581
he can gather them and count them?"

794
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,963
I'm like, "Yeah, fuck it. Do it.
Might be fun. I don't know."

795
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:24,299
"I'd like to check that out, personally."

796
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:31,098
Being diagnosed, getting tested,
just... it's helped us so much.

797
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:34,309
Like, I understand his behavior now.
You know?

798
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:37,771
Like, when someone's in the middle
of a long, boring story,

799
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,774
he will straight up just walk away.

800
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,860
[audience laughing]

801
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,324
I'm like,
"Where's this motherfucker going?"

802
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,291
Never really lands a compliment with me.

803
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,627
He tells me I look comfortable a lot.

804
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:12,556
We just have different love languages.
You know?

805
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:17,102
Like, I was feeling
kind of sentimental the other night.

806
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:19,271
We were sitting outside. It was...

807
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:22,024
a nice night.
It looked like it was gonna rain, and, uh...

808
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:24,026
I just said, "You know, baby,

809
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:26,236
even though these last couple of years,

810
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,739
raising a toddler during a pandemic,

811
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:33,035
it's been so stressful.
But still, getting to be with you,

812
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:34,827
with our son,

813
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:37,956
these have by far been the best years
of my life."

814
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:41,126
And he just looked at me and he said,

815
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,046
"I'm gonna go put the windows up
in the car."

816
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:46,131
[audience laughing]

817
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,849
That's my guy, you know?

818
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:00,895
Yeah.

819
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,774
That's when we play the game,
"Autism, or Just a Man?"

820
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:04,691
I don't know.

821
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:05,775
[audience laughing]

822
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,487
Right?

823
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:18,038
This has been such a special,
special show, special night.

824
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,332
I'm gonna leave you
with what he said to me

825
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:22,417
right before I came out on stage tonight.

826
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,960
I said, "Babe...

827
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,046
is this okay?"

828
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:28,090
He said, "Well,

829
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:29,841
it's too late."

830
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,927
[audience laughing]

831
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,389
Thank you so much, LA!

832
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:38,392
I love you! I can stand you!

833
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,475
[audience cheering]

834
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:42,187
[upbeat music playing]

835
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,304
It's so easy.
