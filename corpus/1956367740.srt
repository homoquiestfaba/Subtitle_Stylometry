1
00:01:41,287 --> 00:01:42,687
They are outside.

2
00:01:46,554 --> 00:01:49,227
We are losing power in
the containment chamber!

3
00:03:04,644 --> 00:03:07,282
- Have you heard that?
- Something's close.

4
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:12,058
See, this is what i'm talking about.
My heart is pounding.

5
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:13,560
Get down, get down.

6
00:03:18,275 --> 00:03:20,428
Cubone!

7
00:03:24,478 --> 00:03:26,278
Uhm a Cubone?

8
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,441
We are not catching
you a pokemon, are we?

9
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:35,243
- What?
- Tell me you didn't plan this Jack.

10
00:03:35,244 --> 00:03:37,827
- I'm sor.. are you serious?
- Jack, tell me you didn't plan this.

11
00:03:37,828 --> 00:03:40,695
How dare you! Ok..
Of course not! Come on!

12
00:03:41,676 --> 00:03:43,176
Ok.. maybe

13
00:03:44,295 --> 00:03:46,877
There was a full moon last night,
and my mom already find is,

14
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:49,083
cause she can't.. and was having
a nightmare so she..

15
00:03:49,084 --> 00:03:50,956
Brought me a glass of warm milk.

16
00:03:50,957 --> 00:03:54,358
Dude, i thought you wanted to, you know,
hangout and relive the good old days

17
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:58,115
- Like when we were kids.
- I do! But just look at it.

18
00:03:58,116 --> 00:04:01,413
That is the perfect Pokémon for you.

19
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:06,077
Jack i'm not looking for a Pokémon.
I've told you this.

20
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:07,998
I've thought long
and hard about this, ok?

21
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:10,458
Water type is not right for you.
Neither is fire type.

22
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,240
- But Cubone is...
- Lonely.

23
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:14,241
Exactly!

24
00:04:14,242 --> 00:04:16,693
Ok thank you, Jack.
Thank you for that.

25
00:04:16,694 --> 00:04:19,493
There are any other emotional
treat bones you wanna drop on me?

26
00:04:19,494 --> 00:04:22,603
Maybe later, but right now
the truth is in my hands.

27
00:04:25,827 --> 00:04:28,387
- Just give me the ball.
- Yes! Yes!

28
00:04:28,388 --> 00:04:31,801
Ok, remember catching a
Pokémon is not about skill.

29
00:04:31,802 --> 00:04:34,014
- So you can do this.
- Good pep talk!

30
00:04:34,015 --> 00:04:36,106
Ok, it has to
choose you too, so..

31
00:04:36,107 --> 00:04:38,864
Make it wanna be
a partner, yeah.

32
00:04:38,865 --> 00:04:41,342
Ehi, Cubone.
What's up buddy?

33
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,981
You know, not everyone can..

34
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:46,428
Pull off wearing the skull
of their dead relative,

35
00:04:46,429 --> 00:04:49,216
but, you know, you sure can.

36
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,370
Ok he didn't like that.

37
00:04:53,952 --> 00:04:55,541
He did not like that.

38
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,899
- Jack.
- Throw it.

39
00:05:01,572 --> 00:05:04,225
- Throw the ball.
- Like a man.

40
00:05:16,098 --> 00:05:17,498
I did it!

41
00:05:19,114 --> 00:05:20,678
Still got it.

42
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,364
The light it's not green.

43
00:05:26,365 --> 00:05:29,285
It still hasn't turned green yet,
Jack that's bad right?

44
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:30,866
Run!

45
00:05:34,842 --> 00:05:37,215
- He didn't chose me!
- Run!

46
00:05:37,216 --> 00:05:40,057
- He didn't chose me, Jack!
- I do see that!

47
00:05:40,058 --> 00:05:41,686
I'm not his choice.

48
00:05:46,863 --> 00:05:48,995
<i>Cubone!</i>

49
00:05:50,052 --> 00:05:53,092
That was one angry Cubone.
It reminded me a lot of my mom.

50
00:05:53,828 --> 00:05:56,818
So uhm, i don't know if this
is gonna sound corny or whatever.

51
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:59,351
Just say it Jack.
I'm too tired to be angry.

52
00:05:59,352 --> 00:06:01,925
- I'm worried about you.
- This again?

53
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:05,311
Ok listen, everyone we know has
left town and now i'm leaving too.

54
00:06:05,312 --> 00:06:08,773
Yeah but that's ok, you gotta do what's
best for you with the time that you got.

55
00:06:08,774 --> 00:06:11,982
That's what i'm doing.
You know i'm crushing it at work.

56
00:06:11,983 --> 00:06:14,481
Gonna get that promotion real soon.

57
00:06:14,482 --> 00:06:17,151
What's the promotion
for an insurance appraiser?

58
00:06:17,152 --> 00:06:19,703
Senior insurance appraiser?

59
00:06:19,704 --> 00:06:22,917
No actually that's two
steps up above where i'm at.

60
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:25,806
You are gonna make me throw up.
That's not a real thing.

61
00:06:26,605 --> 00:06:28,694
Oh i finally have service.

62
00:06:29,238 --> 00:06:32,250
Wait, five voicemails?
I never had five voicemails.

63
00:06:32,251 --> 00:06:34,551
Maybe it's an insurance emergency?

64
00:06:37,952 --> 00:06:39,352
Who is it?

65
00:06:43,223 --> 00:06:46,013
Uhm, it's the Rhyme City
police department.

66
00:06:46,964 --> 00:06:48,464
There was an accident.

67
00:07:20,591 --> 00:07:22,158
Please, don't.

68
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,106
All he hear is, please do it.
Thank you.. thank you.

69
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:29,562
You have a very generous tongue.

70
00:07:32,739 --> 00:07:35,236
Does this Lickintung
belong to anyone?

71
00:07:36,178 --> 00:07:37,905
Anybody? No?

72
00:07:37,906 --> 00:07:39,838
<i>Thank you for
traveling with us.</i>

73
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,406
<i>Please, watch this short informational
video welcoming you to Rhyme City.</i>

74
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:46,741
<i>Throughout history,</i>

75
00:07:46,742 --> 00:07:49,836
<i>Pokémon have been
part of our world.</i>

76
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:53,283
<i>Early humans used to catch
them and train them</i>

77
00:07:53,284 --> 00:07:56,856
<i>to use their unique
powers for the common good.</i>

78
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:01,505
<i>These relationships evolved
into what we now refer to as</i>

79
00:08:01,506 --> 00:08:03,507
<i>Pokémon Battles.</i>

80
00:08:06,615 --> 00:08:10,605
<i>One man changed all of this.
Howard Clifford.</i>

81
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:14,625
<i>Founder and chairman
of Clifford Industries.</i>

82
00:08:14,626 --> 00:08:17,505
<i>Diagnosed with a rare,
degenerative disease,</i>

83
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:19,471
<i>he resigned from his corporation</i>

84
00:08:19,472 --> 00:08:22,138
<i>and searched the world for a cure.</i>

85
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:25,514
<i>And turned out that the
cure i was looking for,</i>

86
00:08:25,515 --> 00:08:29,271
<i>was for me to evolve
into a better version of myself</i>

87
00:08:29,272 --> 00:08:32,044
<i>And i discovered how to do that
through a partnership with Pokémon.</i>

88
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:34,832
<i>And he wanted to
share that discover</i>

89
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,631
<i>with the world.</i>

90
00:08:36,632 --> 00:08:40,371
<i>This is what inspired Howard
Clifford to build Rhyme City.</i>

91
00:08:40,372 --> 00:08:45,164
<i>A place where humans and Pokémon
can live side by side.</i>

92
00:08:45,165 --> 00:08:49,063
<i>Unlike other regions, where
Pokémon live in the wild</i>

93
00:08:49,064 --> 00:08:52,137
<i>here we live
and work together.</i>

94
00:08:52,138 --> 00:08:54,751
<i>No battles, no trainers</i>

95
00:08:54,752 --> 00:08:56,572
<i>no Pokéballs.</i>

96
00:08:56,573 --> 00:09:00,387
<i>A stronger, more harmonious world.</i>

97
00:09:00,388 --> 00:09:02,833
<i>For all our citizens,</i>

98
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:06,108
<i>welcome to Rhyme City.</i>

99
00:09:57,144 --> 00:10:00,660
<i>Fighting fires wouldn't be the
same without their Squirtle partners.</i>

100
00:10:00,661 --> 00:10:03,695
<i>Squirtle. Squirtle.</i>

101
00:10:36,652 --> 00:10:39,456
- Hi, Tim.
- Lieutenant Yoshida.

102
00:10:41,364 --> 00:10:43,924
Your dad was the
best of the best.

103
00:10:43,925 --> 00:10:46,594
He was a legend in this precinct.

104
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,380
Thank you, thank you
for saying that.

105
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,889
It was a terrible tragedy
losing him and his partner.

106
00:10:55,415 --> 00:10:58,153
- His partner?
- His Pokémon.

107
00:10:58,154 --> 00:10:59,746
Oh.. i didn't..

108
00:11:01,354 --> 00:11:03,306
I'm sorry, is yours mad at me?

109
00:11:03,307 --> 00:11:05,613
- Snubbull?
- Yeah.

110
00:11:05,614 --> 00:11:07,555
He may look grumpy on the outside,

111
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:10,829
but i assure you he is
adorable on the inside.

112
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:17,413
If you don't mind me asking,
how come you don't have a Pokémon?

113
00:11:17,414 --> 00:11:21,599
I thought i remember Harry saying you
wanted to be a Pokémon trainer

114
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,132
- when you were young.
- Yeah that didn't really work out.

115
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:27,338
I work in insurance now.

116
00:11:28,097 --> 00:11:29,812
I understand.

117
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:34,669
But Tim, please don't put
this all on yourself.

118
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,633
No one should go through
this type of thing alone.

119
00:11:37,634 --> 00:11:41,026
- If you are anything like your dad...
- I'm not.

120
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:44,821
I was just really raised
by my grandmother.

121
00:11:44,822 --> 00:11:48,058
Do you have the spare keys for his apartment?
I should go wrap things up there.

122
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:51,285
Of course, of course.

123
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:55,694
- This is the address.
- Awesome.

124
00:11:55,695 --> 00:11:58,918
- I can take you over if you want.
- No, no. I'm all good.

125
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:01,034
Thank you so much.

126
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,227
Tim...

127
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,225
This job, it demands a lot.

128
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:15,571
But you were on his mind every day.

129
00:12:15,572 --> 00:12:19,423
He loved you more than
anything else in the world.

130
00:12:25,514 --> 00:12:28,141
Uhm, it was nice to
meet you, lieutenant.

131
00:13:29,494 --> 00:13:31,050
- Excuse me.
- Treecko...

132
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,882
- Tree!
- Ok..

133
00:13:47,007 --> 00:13:48,542
Psyduck?

134
00:13:48,874 --> 00:13:50,367
Psyduck.

135
00:13:52,586 --> 00:13:54,608
Are you trying to rob me,
or just annoy me?

136
00:13:54,609 --> 00:13:56,963
- Psyduck.
- He is with me.

137
00:13:59,096 --> 00:14:01,768
- We need to talk.
- We do?

138
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:04,463
I've been waiting to see
who would open up that mailbox.

139
00:14:04,464 --> 00:14:07,105
You just walked in
into quite the story.

140
00:14:07,845 --> 00:14:10,033
Stories like this spread fear.

141
00:14:10,034 --> 00:14:13,167
And they are afraid of fear.
But i don't fear, fear.

142
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:15,435
I walk the walk, and i talk the
talk, and i'm willing to do

143
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:17,967
whatever it takes get the honest
scoop and that's the hard truth.

144
00:14:20,358 --> 00:14:23,528
I'm sorry, who are you?

145
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:27,583
Lucy Stevens.
Reporter for CNM.

146
00:14:27,584 --> 00:14:30,503
Oh.. you seem kinda young for that.

147
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,420
I work for the CNM Blog,
making Pokémon lists all day, ok?

148
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:36,631
- Top 10 cutest Pokémon.
- Yeah my grandma loves those.

149
00:14:36,632 --> 00:14:38,366
Yeah newsflash: they are all cute!

150
00:14:38,367 --> 00:14:41,076
Such a waste of time for someone
with my nose for a story.

151
00:14:41,786 --> 00:14:44,517
No, no, not now, Psyduck.
I'm working a source...

152
00:14:44,518 --> 00:14:46,621
Ok.. i'll get.. uh..

153
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:49,215
I'm gonna need you to
go on record and tell

154
00:14:49,216 --> 00:14:51,277
me everything you know
about Harry Goodman.

155
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,104
- Wait, what?
- Harry was onto something big.

156
00:14:56,105 --> 00:14:57,512
Real big.

157
00:14:57,513 --> 00:15:01,391
And then all of the sudden, his
car crashes over a bridge, i think not,

158
00:15:01,392 --> 00:15:03,545
- something's rotten and i'm
gonna get to the bottom of it.

159
00:15:03,546 --> 00:15:04,908
- Ehi look, i barely
know the guy,

160
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:06,608
- i haven't seen him in years.
- Where is your Pokémon partner?

161
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:09,014
I don't have one, why is
everyone keep asking me that?

162
00:15:09,015 --> 00:15:10,867
- Loner, probably hiding something.
- Psyduck!

163
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,885
- Ok i'm gonna go.
- Ehi!

164
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:17,074
I may only be an unpaid intern,
but i can smell a story,

165
00:15:17,475 --> 00:15:19,112
and i'm going to find it.

166
00:15:19,174 --> 00:15:20,818
Ok, you do that.

167
00:15:23,814 --> 00:15:27,264
- Come on Psyduck, let's go.
- Psyduck.

168
00:15:43,564 --> 00:15:45,643
<i>- Who is it?</i>
- Hello?

169
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:48,829
<i>It's me Snakes, i got the stuff.</i>

170
00:15:49,884 --> 00:15:52,463
<i>Leave it on the doorstep,
and get the hell outta here.</i>

171
00:15:52,464 --> 00:15:55,599
<i>Alright, Johnny.
But what about my money?</i>

172
00:15:56,764 --> 00:15:59,163
Still with the old
detective movies?

173
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:50,299
What the...

174
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:55,056
What.. is this stuff?

175
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:25,725
"Dear Tim, i can do better
if you give me a chance.

176
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:28,746
I will always have a
place for you to stay."

177
00:17:31,455 --> 00:17:33,842
<i>Your father will pick
you up at the station.</i>

178
00:17:33,843 --> 00:17:35,260
<i>I'm not going.</i>

179
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:37,714
<i>- What?
- I don't wanna go..</i>

180
00:17:37,715 --> 00:17:39,822
<i>I wanna stay with
you and grandma.</i>

181
00:18:02,671 --> 00:18:04,295
Oh man.

182
00:18:06,514 --> 00:18:08,562
<i>This is the most
important day of my life</i>

183
00:18:08,563 --> 00:18:10,308
<i>I know, Tim.</i>

184
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:13,642
<i>But your mother had to see
the doctor, it couldn't wait.</i>

185
00:18:40,364 --> 00:18:42,027
Is someone there?

186
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:47,274
Hello?

187
00:18:57,247 --> 00:18:59,177
Ouch.. that's a sprain...

188
00:19:05,407 --> 00:19:07,516
<i>Ok, ok, ok.</i>

189
00:19:08,811 --> 00:19:10,982
Whoever you are...

190
00:19:11,686 --> 00:19:13,605
i know how to use this.

191
00:19:21,615 --> 00:19:24,750
- It's a Pikachu?
- Oh.. jeez.

192
00:19:24,751 --> 00:19:28,009
Ehi, little guy,
how did you get in here?

193
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:31,956
I know you can't understand me,

194
00:19:31,957 --> 00:19:34,009
but put down the stapler,

195
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:38,725
or i will electrocute you.

196
00:19:41,352 --> 00:19:42,894
Did you just talk?

197
00:19:42,895 --> 00:19:45,156
Woah, did you just understand me?

198
00:19:45,157 --> 00:19:46,630
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait...

199
00:19:46,631 --> 00:19:49,103
That is heavy eye contact right there.
You heard me.

200
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,720
- No, no, no.
- Yes you did! Oh my god! This is amazing.

201
00:19:51,721 --> 00:19:53,342
- Stop, stop, stop it!
- You do understand me!

202
00:19:53,343 --> 00:19:55,195
I've been so lonely.

203
00:19:55,196 --> 00:19:58,263
- I'm gonna throw up.
- No, kid, i need your help.

204
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:00,508
- I'm in serious trouble i need you to listen.
- I'm gonna throw up. I'm gonna throw up.

205
00:20:01,926 --> 00:20:03,363
- No, no, no.
- Excuse me, Aipom.

206
00:20:03,364 --> 00:20:04,936
We are having a private
conversation here please.

207
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,676
- Stop talking, you are hallucinating.
- You are hallucinating.

208
00:20:07,677 --> 00:20:09,604
You, out! Shoo! Go!

209
00:20:10,156 --> 00:20:13,514
I'll tread lightly with that chief.
That, that Aipom don't look right.

210
00:20:16,065 --> 00:20:17,811
Get off!

211
00:20:18,715 --> 00:20:20,887
Get up kid,
he is coming back around!

212
00:20:21,307 --> 00:20:22,935
Ok, here's what you wanna do.

213
00:20:22,936 --> 00:20:25,229
Ok, you wanna bite him,
you wanna scream,

214
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,060
we are playing charades,
we are not playing charades,

215
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:29,091
Ok, i'm gonna get a knife

216
00:20:29,092 --> 00:20:31,944
- Not the knife.
- Ok bad idea with the knife, i'll find something else.

217
00:20:31,945 --> 00:20:33,644
Eat this!

218
00:20:33,645 --> 00:20:37,391
You are so welcome.
This is a hungry little guy.

219
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,256
Come on kid, let's move!

220
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,061
To the roof!

221
00:20:57,739 --> 00:21:01,428
Brilliant idea, you hold
the door, i'll go get help

222
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:02,842
- What?
- Help!

223
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,867
Oh my god, help!

224
00:21:09,657 --> 00:21:11,057
Oh shit.

225
00:21:11,866 --> 00:21:14,854
Help! Help!
Oh my god help!

226
00:21:14,855 --> 00:21:16,859
Oh he is being eaten alive!

227
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,299
Oh he is being eaten alive!

228
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,384
A man is dying!

229
00:21:30,785 --> 00:21:33,253
No one's coming,
people are so insensitive!

230
00:21:33,254 --> 00:21:36,149
Oh oh, put your pants back on,
and run like the wind.

231
00:21:42,921 --> 00:21:46,094
They seem to be more attracted
to your increasing nudeness!

232
00:21:46,518 --> 00:21:47,918
Ok.

233
00:21:48,566 --> 00:21:50,168
Alright we are jumping down here.

234
00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:52,990
- No, no! I'm not going into the trash chute.
- Good call,

235
00:21:52,991 --> 00:21:55,688
let me know how it goes with
the super crazy Pokémon.

236
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,492
You died a hero.

237
00:22:05,071 --> 00:22:08,021
- Way to stick the landing kid.
- Leave me alone!

238
00:22:09,434 --> 00:22:12,574
Oh, looks like someone's
back in a good mood.

239
00:22:13,855 --> 00:22:15,695
Run! Ravage Aipoms!

240
00:22:15,696 --> 00:22:17,261
Look out!

241
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,421
Run! Go, go, go, go!

242
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,891
They...

243
00:22:22,985 --> 00:22:26,040
I think pants are gonna
do you a lot of good right now.

244
00:22:29,136 --> 00:22:30,537
Shoo! Go!

245
00:22:30,538 --> 00:22:33,835
You know, i've pictured you as a,
as a bit of a briefs guy, but those are nice.

246
00:22:33,836 --> 00:22:37,146
Me, i don't wear underwear.
You know, i'm not modest.

247
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,547
Excuse me, excuse me,
hi, sorry,

248
00:22:38,548 --> 00:22:40,633
You can hear him, right?
You can hear him talking?

249
00:22:40,634 --> 00:22:42,057
Pika-Pika.

250
00:22:42,717 --> 00:22:45,892
Oh, Pika-Pika-Pika,
he is adorable.

251
00:22:45,893 --> 00:22:48,252
You are adorable.
They can't understand me kid.

252
00:22:48,253 --> 00:22:51,688
It's me, it's that stuff
that i put up my nose.

253
00:22:51,689 --> 00:22:54,694
No, not like that, it was
a gas, i was breathing gas.

254
00:22:54,695 --> 00:22:56,400
Accidentally, accidentally...

255
00:22:56,401 --> 00:23:00,893
unless you want charming law to give
you one way ticket to hoosegow. Let's move.

256
00:23:00,894 --> 00:23:03,493
- No one else can hear him?
- This is a first for me too, kid.

257
00:23:03,494 --> 00:23:06,351
I tried to talk to the all the time
all they hear is "Pika-Pika".

258
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:08,872
Pet me, or kiss me,
stick a finger in me.

259
00:23:08,873 --> 00:23:10,665
- It's really gross.
- Anyone? No one else can hear him?

260
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:12,985
Can you hear him talking?
Can you hear him saying words?

261
00:23:12,986 --> 00:23:14,892
What are you not getting here kid.

262
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,592
You are the only one who can hear me.

263
00:23:16,593 --> 00:23:18,298
- It's like destiny.
- It's not destiny.

264
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:21,132
- Than why were you in that apartment?
- It's my father's place.

265
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:24,012
That's why i was there.
Why where you there?

266
00:23:24,013 --> 00:23:25,623
You are Harry's son?

267
00:23:29,094 --> 00:23:30,791
How do you know his name?

268
00:23:38,802 --> 00:23:40,593
You are Harry Pokémon's partner?

269
00:23:42,206 --> 00:23:43,682
You want a coffee?

270
00:23:45,302 --> 00:23:47,580
'Cause i could use a coffee.

271
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:49,265
Yeah, let's get a coffee.

272
00:23:50,257 --> 00:23:51,657
Yeah, come on.

273
00:24:04,149 --> 00:24:05,549
So there i was,

274
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:08,894
in the middle of nowhere,
with a bad case of the forgetsies.

275
00:24:08,895 --> 00:24:12,914
The only clue to my past, is Harry's
name and address inside this hat.

276
00:24:12,915 --> 00:24:16,067
So, i made my way to the apartment
and that's when i've found you.

277
00:24:16,068 --> 00:24:18,913
<i>Jiggaly... puff... jiggaly...</i>

278
00:24:18,914 --> 00:24:21,428
- I don't know, maybe i've got too deep.
- Deep in what?

279
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:24,240
You know, mix up with the
wrong crowd, that kind of thing.

280
00:24:24,241 --> 00:24:25,846
Happens to the best of us.

281
00:24:25,847 --> 00:24:28,334
The deads pile up,
the walls close in.

282
00:24:28,335 --> 00:24:31,085
Right becomes wrong,
wrong becomes wrong.

283
00:24:31,086 --> 00:24:32,714
- Wait, who are you calling?
- No one.

284
00:24:32,715 --> 00:24:35,417
Yeah, yeah, no that's sounds great, that
sounds great. This menu looks really nice.

285
00:24:35,418 --> 00:24:37,987
Wait, i'm confused, are you
hearing other voices besides mine?

286
00:24:37,988 --> 00:24:40,371
All i wanna know is, why
do i understand you?

287
00:24:40,372 --> 00:24:44,718
Can't help you there kid. Like i said
i have amnesia. I can't remember a darn thing.

288
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:48,695
Ok so you are a talking Pikachu,
with no memories, who's addicted to caffeine.

289
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:51,657
I can stop wherever i want.
These are just choices.

290
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:53,370
Another round, extra shot.

291
00:24:53,371 --> 00:24:55,503
- Like is night. Thank you sweety.
- Ludicolo!

292
00:24:55,504 --> 00:24:56,910
Look, i'm a great detective

293
00:24:56,911 --> 00:24:59,410
but i can solve my own mystery
if i have no memory.

294
00:24:59,411 --> 00:25:03,356
- Then how do you even know you are a detective?
- Well that, i can feel that in my jellys.

295
00:25:03,357 --> 00:25:07,877
- What is that, what is that?
- It's the jellys, it's a thing, you know you feel it.

296
00:25:07,878 --> 00:25:11,379
When you really believe in something
despite everyone telling you, you are wrong.

297
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,874
Which is why i need to find Harry.
He is the key to my past.

298
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:16,859
- Ludicolo!
- Thanks doll.

299
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,400
I've got some bad news
for you, 'cause uh..

300
00:25:19,401 --> 00:25:20,806
Harry is dead.

301
00:25:22,417 --> 00:25:24,783
What? No.

302
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:26,972
No, no, no, Harry ain't dead.

303
00:25:26,973 --> 00:25:29,551
No, Harry is dead.
You are wrong, sorry.

304
00:25:29,552 --> 00:25:31,080
I saw on the police report
that he is dead.

305
00:25:31,081 --> 00:25:33,555
- Just 'cause the cop say he is dead..
- I mean he is legally dead.

306
00:25:33,556 --> 00:25:36,137
Really?
Did they found a body?

307
00:25:37,421 --> 00:25:38,947
Well i didn't think so.

308
00:25:38,948 --> 00:25:41,933
And by the way, did that report
also say that i'm dead?

309
00:25:41,934 --> 00:25:44,506
'Cause if i'm still alive and kicking
that means Harry is out there too.

310
00:25:44,507 --> 00:25:47,079
Case closed.
But still open!

311
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,905
- Until i solve it.
- Ok, i'll bite, solve what?

312
00:25:49,906 --> 00:25:51,306
Oh i'm glad you are gonna bite.

313
00:25:51,307 --> 00:25:53,432
Alright, here it is:

314
00:25:53,433 --> 00:25:55,700
Harry faked his own death.

315
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:58,575
Or, somebody else
faked Harry's death.

316
00:25:58,576 --> 00:26:02,474
Or, Harry faked
somebody else's death.

317
00:26:02,475 --> 00:26:05,574
- That last one, doesn't work out.
- No, no it doesn't.

318
00:26:05,575 --> 00:26:07,048
But the first two do, real contenders.

319
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:09,894
- No, uh, i'm gonna go, we are done here..
- No we are not done here...

320
00:26:09,895 --> 00:26:12,158
Wait, wait, wait a minute,
where are you going?

321
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,237
- Hold up a second, we are gonna need each other.
- No, we don't.

322
00:26:15,238 --> 00:26:17,657
I don't need a Pokémon.
Period. Got it?

323
00:26:17,658 --> 00:26:19,241
And what about a world class detective.

324
00:26:19,242 --> 00:26:22,194
Because if you wanna find your pops,
i'm your best bet.

325
00:26:22,195 --> 00:26:24,718
I think a world class detective
would have already figured out by now

326
00:26:24,719 --> 00:26:26,685
that i'm not here
to find my father.

327
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:28,665
I'm here, to say goodbye.

328
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:31,284
Ehi, ehi, there's no one
to say goodbye to.

329
00:26:31,285 --> 00:26:33,959
Look, you can talk to humans,
i can talk to Pokémon.

330
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,938
We can talk to each other.

331
00:26:35,939 --> 00:26:39,178
This doesn't happen, kid.
It has to mean something.

332
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:41,299
- Can you..
- It's magic, that brought us together.

333
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,746
And that magic is called: Hope.

334
00:26:45,901 --> 00:26:49,444
Hope that Harry is still alive.

335
00:26:53,643 --> 00:26:57,515
Ooh, you feel it.
You feel it in your jellys don't you?

336
00:26:57,516 --> 00:26:59,016
There's nothing in my jellys.

337
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:01,705
We are gonna do this.
You and me.

338
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:05,979
I can't believ...

339
00:27:07,218 --> 00:27:09,297
I will meet you here
tomorrow morning.

340
00:27:09,298 --> 00:27:10,698
Great.

341
00:27:11,165 --> 00:27:13,178
- Where are you going?
- To my apartment.

342
00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:15,431
What do you mean "your apartment"?

343
00:27:15,432 --> 00:27:18,464
- What? Alright you can sleep on the couch.
- No i'm not gonna sleep on the couch.

344
00:27:18,465 --> 00:27:20,211
Well, then you can sleep on the stove.

345
00:27:20,212 --> 00:27:23,017
- Be a dear, would you get the door for me?
- Oh my god, what am i doing?

346
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:25,138
I just invited someone
to my apartment!

347
00:27:25,139 --> 00:27:28,201
I never do this, i'm not
that kind of Pokémon.

348
00:27:32,608 --> 00:27:35,701
Dust everywhere,
no fingerprints.

349
00:27:36,424 --> 00:27:38,364
It doesn't add up.

350
00:27:38,846 --> 00:27:42,152
- What is going on in here?
- I'm searching the joint. Looking for clues to my past.

351
00:27:42,153 --> 00:27:43,609
- Is this your room?
- No.

352
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,887
- Does Harry have other children?
- No.

353
00:27:47,303 --> 00:27:49,117
He wanted me to live
here when i was a kid,

354
00:27:49,118 --> 00:27:51,269
so he made it look like
my childhood room.

355
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:54,625
Should we talking about the fact
that your childhood bed is a Pikachu bed?

356
00:27:54,626 --> 00:27:57,272
- It's a coincidence.
- I'm sorry can you speak up?

357
00:27:57,273 --> 00:27:58,952
I can't hear you.

358
00:27:58,953 --> 00:28:01,553
I've never been so flattered
and creeped out at the same time.

359
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:04,386
- Are you gonna make me into a lampshade?
- Oh i might.

360
00:28:04,387 --> 00:28:07,068
Hang on, hang on, hang on,
all this Pokémon cards..

361
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:10,168
And the battle posters,
There's a connection, isn't there?

362
00:28:10,169 --> 00:28:13,006
- You love Pokémon.
- No.

363
00:28:13,007 --> 00:28:15,840
- Yeah, yeah you do.
- That was a long time ago..

364
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:17,521
Before my father moved to the city

365
00:28:17,522 --> 00:28:19,915
and spent more time with
Pokémon than his own son.

366
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:21,540
Uhm, yeah, blaming the dad.

367
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:23,170
Ok, look, what about this:

368
00:28:23,171 --> 00:28:26,490
this picture is all over the apartment
she is obviously connected to Harry,

369
00:28:26,491 --> 00:28:29,324
she might know me.
She could be a lead.

370
00:28:29,325 --> 00:28:30,996
No, she is not.

371
00:28:31,983 --> 00:28:33,748
That's my mom.

372
00:28:33,749 --> 00:28:35,643
She passed away when i was eleven.

373
00:28:36,669 --> 00:28:38,771
Oh, i'm sorry, i didn't...

374
00:28:38,772 --> 00:28:40,391
i didn't realize.

375
00:28:44,238 --> 00:28:47,620
Tomorrow morning i'm gonna take you
to Yoshida so we can get some answers.

376
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:19,565
- Argh, my clues!
- What is all this?!

377
00:29:19,566 --> 00:29:22,246
Hard work, that's what this is!
And by the way...

378
00:29:22,247 --> 00:29:24,852
we can't go to the cops
not until we know who we can trust.

379
00:29:24,853 --> 00:29:28,698
- So put my clues back in order would you?
- These are not clues. This is the work of a serial killer.

380
00:29:28,699 --> 00:29:30,827
- Were almost clues.
- What does that even mean?

381
00:29:30,828 --> 00:29:34,697
I'm trying to jog my memory, retrace my steps,
it helps me to see it all laid out.

382
00:29:34,698 --> 00:29:36,667
That's how i found this...

383
00:29:36,668 --> 00:29:39,434
This, is what a french man
would call Caliente Fiesta.

384
00:29:39,435 --> 00:29:42,188
- Not french.
- Smell my finger.

385
00:29:42,189 --> 00:29:45,046
- I would never smell your finger.
- Coward.

386
00:29:45,047 --> 00:29:48,560
The point is that i smelled this "R" stuff
on those Aipom when they attacked us yesterday.

387
00:29:48,561 --> 00:29:51,602
- "R"?
- Bingo! La Cucaracha.

388
00:29:52,642 --> 00:29:57,449
So i'm thinking, Harry
caught a break in the case,

389
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,264
forcing his shadowing kingpins
to send down hired goons

390
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:02,425
to deliver the big hush hush..

391
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:05,186
We need to retrace Harry's steps,
either solve the case ourselves,

392
00:30:05,187 --> 00:30:07,481
or get far enough along
so that the number one bad guy

393
00:30:07,482 --> 00:30:09,606
has to reveal himself
or herself!

394
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:13,498
- You need to stop doing that.
- So what is the way in?

395
00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:14,903
The answer is in this room.

396
00:30:14,904 --> 00:30:17,023
This isn't a room,
this is a fire hazard.

397
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:20,355
Is just junk, and papers.. and..

398
00:30:22,937 --> 00:30:24,479
Newspapers.

399
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,080
What you got kid?

400
00:30:26,081 --> 00:30:30,491
I literally just met someone,
she was a junior reporter at CNM.

401
00:30:30,492 --> 00:30:32,583
She was doing a story on Harry.

402
00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:34,795
I think she knows more than she let on.

403
00:30:34,796 --> 00:30:36,805
The smart ones always do.

404
00:30:36,806 --> 00:30:38,834
We gotta go down to
her work and press her.

405
00:30:38,835 --> 00:30:41,543
- That's a metaphor.
- Yeah i know what a metaphor is.

406
00:30:41,544 --> 00:30:43,910
I was drinking that.
I was also drinking..

407
00:30:43,911 --> 00:30:45,963
Just step anywhere,
it's only my life's work.

408
00:30:45,964 --> 00:30:47,516
No, no.

409
00:30:47,517 --> 00:30:49,962
- We are not doing that.
- Fine, i'll walk.

410
00:30:49,963 --> 00:30:52,775
I'm trying to get
100.000 steps this hour.

411
00:30:54,997 --> 00:30:59,432
<i>Hello i'm Roger Clifford, president
of CNM and chairman of Clifford Enterprises.</i>

412
00:30:59,433 --> 00:31:00,904
<i>And i'm Howard Clifford,</i>

413
00:31:00,905 --> 00:31:03,330
<i>the visionary icon behind Rhyme City.</i>

414
00:31:03,331 --> 00:31:05,377
<i>Together, in the spirit of harmony</i>

415
00:31:05,378 --> 00:31:09,077
<i>we are throwing the largest
parade that Rhyme City has ever seen.</i>

416
00:31:09,078 --> 00:31:11,432
- You won't wanna miss it.
- So at the weekend,

417
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:14,460
- we invite the people...
- and the Pokémon to be there.

418
00:31:14,461 --> 00:31:18,983
A celebration of the harmony
between humans and Pokémon.

419
00:31:18,984 --> 00:31:20,384
And, cut!

420
00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:24,350
- Oh i think that went rather well.
- Oh shut up dad.

421
00:31:24,351 --> 00:31:26,557
- He seems nice.
- Roger, please.

422
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:29,276
This is supposed to be
our gift to the citizens.

423
00:31:29,277 --> 00:31:31,417
Visionary icon, really?

424
00:31:31,418 --> 00:31:33,718
Was "Savior of the world" taken?

425
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:36,254
It was your people who
wrote the promo, son.

426
00:31:36,255 --> 00:31:39,954
Oh is there an unabridged version
where you cure cancer?

427
00:31:39,955 --> 00:31:43,401
Oh that's right, turn your back
on me, like you always did.

428
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:46,122
- Ditto!
- By the way, no one likes your Pokémon.

429
00:31:46,123 --> 00:31:47,523
There she is.

430
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:50,077
I can see why you
were so excited.

431
00:31:50,078 --> 00:31:52,025
Ok.. I was not..

432
00:31:52,026 --> 00:31:54,308
- That excited.
- Mr. Clifford.. Mr. Clifford..

433
00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:57,207
Mr. Clifford, i may have
a story for you.

434
00:31:57,208 --> 00:32:00,317
I've heard rumors of
Pokémon attacking people

435
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,247
- But there's been no mainstream coverage...
- I'm sorry..

436
00:32:02,248 --> 00:32:05,311
We are not a tabloid, which
means that we don't report

437
00:32:05,312 --> 00:32:08,242
on rumors, gossip,
or hearsay.

438
00:32:08,243 --> 00:32:10,977
It's not news if it can't be verified.

439
00:32:10,978 --> 00:32:14,837
You want a story, find a source.

440
00:32:14,838 --> 00:32:17,227
Oh and pro tip..

441
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:20,463
A reasonable sense of fashion.

442
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:34,675
Here she comes, here she comes,
try to look deep.

443
00:32:34,676 --> 00:32:36,113
What are you doing here?

444
00:32:36,114 --> 00:32:37,657
Ehi, again.

445
00:32:37,658 --> 00:32:40,344
Yeah, i know this is your work,
but i actually needed to ask you something.

446
00:32:40,345 --> 00:32:43,123
Now is not really a good time.

447
00:32:43,124 --> 00:32:46,097
Yeah, i saw that.
I'm sorry.

448
00:32:51,373 --> 00:32:53,986
Sorry. It's piping hot.

449
00:32:53,987 --> 00:32:56,519
You found yourself a Pokémon partner.

450
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,525
- Not exactly, no.
- Oh he is cute.

451
00:32:59,526 --> 00:33:01,738
Yeah she is trying to work me kid,
but trust me, i can oh...

452
00:33:01,739 --> 00:33:04,600
sweet mother of Arceus,
that feels so good.

453
00:33:04,601 --> 00:33:07,095
- So.. listen.
- Oh my god.. oh.

454
00:33:07,096 --> 00:33:08,497
What happened?

455
00:33:08,498 --> 00:33:10,259
I've found something
on Harry's desk.

456
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,719
- Nearly choked me to death, and..
- No, not here.

457
00:33:15,104 --> 00:33:16,541
In my office.

458
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:20,536
In her office.
We are going in her office.

459
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,365
This is great...

460
00:33:24,366 --> 00:33:27,687
This isn't her office, it's a
coffin, with pencils.

461
00:33:27,688 --> 00:33:30,080
- Psyduck?
- Yeah that's right i can talk to the kid

462
00:33:30,081 --> 00:33:31,638
and he can talk to me.
We are gifted.

463
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:33,466
You didn't tell me that
she has a Psyduck.

464
00:33:33,467 --> 00:33:35,513
This things explodes
when they are stressed.

465
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:40,450
Ehi, ehi, keep calm duck.
Serenity now, serenity now.

466
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:42,387
- No.
- Ok.

467
00:33:43,664 --> 00:33:46,496
- Ok, here it is.
- You got it?

468
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,380
Where did you find these?

469
00:33:51,381 --> 00:33:54,398
Word on the street is that
Harry had an informer near the docks.

470
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,398
I went there to snoop around.

471
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,338
And that's where i've found the vials.

472
00:33:58,339 --> 00:34:00,059
But the docks can be dangerous.

473
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,722
It's not the sort of place
you want to visit alone at night.

474
00:34:04,765 --> 00:34:07,158
I'm actually pretty good
at being alone at night.

475
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,171
Nope that did not land right at all.

476
00:34:11,858 --> 00:34:15,799
It's not.. it's not what
i meant to say.. uhm

477
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,679
- It's ok.
- I'm just gonna...

478
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,281
We should go.

479
00:34:19,282 --> 00:34:21,189
Yeah, yeah, we should go.

480
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,788
Good god,

481
00:34:22,789 --> 00:34:24,654
have you ever talked
to a women before?

482
00:34:24,655 --> 00:34:26,093
Psyduck...

483
00:34:26,094 --> 00:34:28,680
Yes i've talked to women before,
and no i don't need your help.

484
00:34:28,681 --> 00:34:30,522
It was during the birth canal or...?

485
00:34:35,601 --> 00:34:39,129
You know what you need? A shoulder
saddle. I bet someone makes one.

486
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:41,527
Ok, there are other ways for you
to get around. This is humiliating.

487
00:34:41,528 --> 00:34:44,874
Every step for you is a thousand for me,
and my lungs are the size of grapes.

488
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:47,415
We need to get some ground rules
if this partnership is gonna work.

489
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:49,877
- You are not my partner.
- Mentor, Sensei, Master,

490
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:51,735
whatever you wanna call it,
i'm fine with all of those.

491
00:34:51,736 --> 00:34:54,684
And what if it wasn't the gas?
What if it's hereditary, uh?

492
00:34:54,685 --> 00:34:56,779
What if Harry could understand
your annoying voice too.

493
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,190
You don't need to talk to us
for us to understand.

494
00:34:59,191 --> 00:35:00,909
We can feel what you are saying.

495
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:03,889
You have to be open to the experience.
Try it sometimes.

496
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:06,888
Yeah i rather not.
I've got my plate full talking to you.

497
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:09,967
- What is that?
- Silent, but deadly.

498
00:35:09,968 --> 00:35:12,057
Apologies, my tummy is bad
from all the coffee.

499
00:35:12,058 --> 00:35:13,702
No, eew, get off!

500
00:35:14,688 --> 00:35:16,088
I meant that.

501
00:35:17,772 --> 00:35:19,172
Oh that...

502
00:35:19,173 --> 00:35:23,660
It's a Mr. Mime, they are the worst,
silent, but annoying.

503
00:35:24,821 --> 00:35:28,006
Does he recognize you?
I think he recognizes you.

504
00:35:28,007 --> 00:35:30,571
Well i was Harry's partner,
so i would've been with him.

505
00:35:31,118 --> 00:35:33,591
- Oh, Harry's informant is a Pokémon!
- Oh, Harry's informant is a Pokémon!

506
00:35:33,592 --> 00:35:34,992
Get him!

507
00:35:40,715 --> 00:35:43,353
- He is barely moving.
- Don't tell him that.

508
00:35:43,354 --> 00:35:44,844
Oh he is on a bike.

509
00:35:44,845 --> 00:35:48,517
Come on he thinks he is getting away. Quick
get in front of him. Cut him off, you can make it.

510
00:35:48,518 --> 00:35:49,918
Stop!

511
00:35:52,145 --> 00:35:54,065
Oh no he is going down hard, Tim.

512
00:35:54,066 --> 00:35:55,899
Should've wear a helmet.

513
00:35:56,369 --> 00:35:59,262
- I hope he makes it.
- Come on, this is ridiculous.

514
00:35:59,996 --> 00:36:01,653
I'm good cop, you are bad cop.

515
00:36:01,654 --> 00:36:03,724
- We are not cops.
- Grow some berries.

516
00:36:03,725 --> 00:36:06,510
You are bigger and tougher looking
than i am, stand up straight.

517
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:10,066
Listen up, we got ways to
make you talk, or mime.

518
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:11,627
So tell us what we wanna know..

519
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:15,748
Why was Harry Goodman here and
what did it had to do with the "R"?

520
00:36:16,692 --> 00:36:18,712
Pipe.
Yes, a can.

521
00:36:18,713 --> 00:36:20,118
Shoving, pushing..

522
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:22,505
The problem is that i push people
away and i hate them for leaving.

523
00:36:22,506 --> 00:36:24,052
He is saying you can "shove it".

524
00:36:24,053 --> 00:36:26,685
What? I can shove it?
Ok that's it. No, we are switching roles.

525
00:36:26,686 --> 00:36:28,266
I'm bad cop, you are good cop.

526
00:36:28,267 --> 00:36:31,607
- No, we are not cops.
- Oh good god, that's a very hard wall.

527
00:36:31,608 --> 00:36:34,894
Oh yeah, Mr. Mime has the abilities
to make invisible walls.

528
00:36:34,895 --> 00:36:38,124
Oh yes i know, i happen to be
a Pokémon too, remember?

529
00:36:38,716 --> 00:36:41,052
Look, Harry figured
this guy out somehow

530
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:44,708
I think the trick is,
getting inside his head.

531
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:47,001
I have an idea.

532
00:36:48,611 --> 00:36:50,011
What are you doing?

533
00:36:51,435 --> 00:36:55,014
What's this? Oh there's a door there?
I didn't.. probably because it's invisible.

534
00:36:55,015 --> 00:36:58,048
Oh yeah, i'm in your space now, right?

535
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,155
You don't like this so much, do you?

536
00:37:00,156 --> 00:37:01,556
What are you doing?

537
00:37:02,482 --> 00:37:04,611
That's a jug.

538
00:37:04,612 --> 00:37:06,822
- No.
- Salt. It's a salt shaker, you are cooking.

539
00:37:06,823 --> 00:37:09,205
Real cooking is by following your
heart not a recipe!

540
00:37:09,206 --> 00:37:12,177
- What are you talking about?
- Gas...

541
00:37:12,178 --> 00:37:13,744
You are pouring gasoline!

542
00:37:14,343 --> 00:37:18,391
Oh, that went dark fast, i like this,
i like this very much.

543
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,107
Alright, alright.

544
00:37:23,548 --> 00:37:26,986
Ok, you wanna play that game?
I'm gonna play that game

545
00:37:29,152 --> 00:37:32,639
You think that's funny?
You think that's funny uh?

546
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,669
I'm gonna be laughing soon.

547
00:37:36,034 --> 00:37:37,936
Who's laughing now? Uh?

548
00:37:39,378 --> 00:37:41,400
Oh i smell what you are stepping in.

549
00:37:41,401 --> 00:37:43,150
That's right Mr. Mime,

550
00:37:43,608 --> 00:37:46,942
you are about to be Mr. Melt
unless you start talking.

551
00:37:47,945 --> 00:37:49,747
Cards, cards,
playing cards, poker..

552
00:37:49,748 --> 00:37:51,917
No i think he is talking
about the "R".

553
00:37:51,918 --> 00:37:53,657
Someone was handing out "R".

554
00:37:53,658 --> 00:37:55,528
Use your body words, where?

555
00:37:55,529 --> 00:37:57,876
Circle, house, Moon house, Moon, House.

556
00:37:57,877 --> 00:38:02,400
Stop with the games, say it! Just
say it! Talk you stupid mime.

557
00:38:02,401 --> 00:38:04,553
Ok.. just.. relax.

558
00:38:04,554 --> 00:38:07,483
Round, round house,

559
00:38:07,484 --> 00:38:10,003
the source of the "R" came from
the round house.

560
00:38:10,004 --> 00:38:12,964
Yeah nice work kid, maybe there's
a little detective in you after all.

561
00:38:29,547 --> 00:38:31,308
Critical hit!

562
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:35,693
Additional damage!

563
00:38:46,335 --> 00:38:48,902
I didn't know they had
Pokémon battle in Rhyme City.

564
00:38:48,903 --> 00:38:50,726
You are not supposed to.

565
00:38:52,427 --> 00:38:55,290
Gengar uses Dark Ball.

566
00:39:05,687 --> 00:39:07,465
Come on, let's take a look around.

567
00:39:13,192 --> 00:39:15,289
Ok kid, so here's what we know:

568
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:17,106
Harry traces the "R" here

569
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:20,361
and frequents this joint, 'cause someone
here knows something about something.

570
00:39:20,362 --> 00:39:23,469
We just need to find this
someone and the something.

571
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:27,501
Ehi, ehi, where's that Pikachu's
partner? Don't go!

572
00:39:27,977 --> 00:39:30,051
I think that someone just found us.

573
00:39:30,052 --> 00:39:32,886
Wow, i'd like to see this
guy internet search history.

574
00:39:32,887 --> 00:39:34,684
- Who are you?
- Let's see where this goes

575
00:39:34,685 --> 00:39:38,489
- tell him i'm your new partner.
- I'm his new partner.

576
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:40,358
Well that Pikachu's thunderbolt

577
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:44,798
almost wrecked my Charizard
last time he was here.

578
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:47,452
A scar to the face.

579
00:39:47,453 --> 00:39:51,166
All i hear are consonants and
all i see are nipples.

580
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:52,676
And you know what?

581
00:39:53,188 --> 00:39:55,780
He ruined my coat man, look at this.

582
00:39:55,781 --> 00:39:58,228
- I'm so sorry.
- Forget the coat, where is his shirt?

583
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,326
This.. this is my place

584
00:40:01,327 --> 00:40:03,946
and nobody comes into my place

585
00:40:03,947 --> 00:40:06,307
and does that to my Pokémon

586
00:40:06,308 --> 00:40:08,935
- What are you looking at?
- or to my coat.

587
00:40:08,936 --> 00:40:10,407
Right, the coat.

588
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,193
The coat..
What are you doing?

589
00:40:12,194 --> 00:40:14,445
Classic stare down kid,
the first one to blink, loses.

590
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:16,785
- Stop distracting me.
- Uh, look,

591
00:40:16,786 --> 00:40:19,562
i just wanna know why his old
partner was here, that's all.

592
00:40:19,563 --> 00:40:21,589
<i>Gengar wins.</i>

593
00:40:22,009 --> 00:40:24,150
<i>Ready for the next battle.</i>

594
00:40:25,043 --> 00:40:27,130
And i want a rematch.

595
00:40:27,449 --> 00:40:29,212
You give me my rematch

596
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:33,399
and i'll tell you everything
you want to know. What i know.

597
00:40:34,638 --> 00:40:36,753
Tell him is on, amigo.

598
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:40,742
- Ok.
- A new battle!

599
00:40:40,743 --> 00:40:43,755
Pikachu versus Charizard.

600
00:40:43,756 --> 00:40:45,820
Rematch!

601
00:40:48,981 --> 00:40:51,116
Here, hold my hat.

602
00:40:51,117 --> 00:40:53,404
- I'm about to rock this place.
- Ok.

603
00:40:54,922 --> 00:40:57,940
I'm just doing some light stretching,
you never want to go on this things tight.

604
00:40:57,941 --> 00:40:59,791
We are going to win this time ok?

605
00:41:00,162 --> 00:41:02,591
What are you doing?
What is your plan of attack?

606
00:41:02,592 --> 00:41:06,228
I do not operate according to plans kid.
I deal with things in the moment.

607
00:41:08,064 --> 00:41:10,173
Ok, here we go.

608
00:41:14,746 --> 00:41:16,181
Now obviously,

609
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:19,848
i've dealt with these punks before,
so i'll just do it again.

610
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:22,827
Give me my hat back!

611
00:41:22,828 --> 00:41:25,868
That thing just chugged a year's
worth of that "R" stuff.

612
00:41:26,764 --> 00:41:29,063
It's like you said ok?
You did it before.

613
00:41:29,064 --> 00:41:31,734
You just gotta use your powers.
You can use Quick Attack,

614
00:41:31,735 --> 00:41:33,378
Discharge or Electric Bomb

615
00:41:33,379 --> 00:41:35,917
but i think Volt Tackle
is your best move

616
00:41:35,918 --> 00:41:37,377
- so let's start with that.
- First of all,

617
00:41:37,378 --> 00:41:39,354
when did you learn how
to be a Pokémon trainer?

618
00:41:39,355 --> 00:41:41,554
And secondly, get me the
hell out of here!

619
00:41:41,555 --> 00:41:42,957
Begin!

620
00:41:44,628 --> 00:41:46,036
Look out!

621
00:41:46,632 --> 00:41:48,220
I've forgot everything you said.

622
00:41:48,221 --> 00:41:50,569
I forget things, it's what i do,
i have amnesia.

623
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:52,714
You wanna go for a critical hit,
use Volt Tackle.

624
00:41:52,715 --> 00:41:56,038
Volt Tackle will knock me out,
i'm going for Thunderbolt.

625
00:41:56,887 --> 00:41:58,312
Come on, you got it, you got it!

626
00:42:07,807 --> 00:42:09,798
Come on, come on, come on..

627
00:42:09,799 --> 00:42:11,879
Ehi bud? What are you doing?

628
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,572
I can't do it when
people are watching.

629
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,450
Can everyone just look away please?

630
00:42:16,198 --> 00:42:17,809
It's not working.

631
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:19,847
I forgot how to use my powers.

632
00:42:22,148 --> 00:42:23,599
But he didn't.

633
00:42:27,995 --> 00:42:29,525
Pikachu, run!

634
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:40,287
Taken out with one hit!

635
00:42:40,288 --> 00:42:42,356
Ehi Pikachu you wanna cry?

636
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,763
You don't wanna do this.

637
00:42:47,764 --> 00:42:49,304
I'm adorable.

638
00:42:49,305 --> 00:42:51,306
Pika-Pika!

639
00:43:00,724 --> 00:43:03,136
Are you crazy?
Get out of there!

640
00:43:05,336 --> 00:43:06,982
I got it kid!

641
00:43:16,739 --> 00:43:19,014
What are you doing to my baby!

642
00:43:19,015 --> 00:43:20,978
Out of the way!

643
00:43:29,617 --> 00:43:31,303
Oh oh, that's not good.

644
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:07,982
- What are you doing..
- Tell me what you know!

645
00:44:07,983 --> 00:44:11,280
The guy you were looking for,
wanted to know the source of "R"

646
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:15,084
it comes from the doctor,
that's all i know.

647
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:16,493
Now let me go.

648
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:33,003
Nice catch kid.
Let's get out of here.

649
00:44:37,711 --> 00:44:39,112
I've got a plan.

650
00:44:39,113 --> 00:44:41,552
Look it's not gonna work,
Magikarp is the worst.

651
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:44,399
Magikarp can evolve into Gyarados,
all he needs it's just a little kick.

652
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,944
Water in the hole!

653
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:51,176
In my head i saw that differently.

654
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:09,522
Ehi Tim, i don't float.

655
00:45:17,293 --> 00:45:19,842
I've told you Magikarps
weren't useless.

656
00:45:21,182 --> 00:45:23,022
You are under arrest.

657
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:27,593
I thought you couldn't
wait to get home.

658
00:45:27,594 --> 00:45:30,259
Yeah well my plan's changed
because i've found him.

659
00:45:31,298 --> 00:45:34,547
- I'm not following.
- Harry is not dead.

660
00:45:34,548 --> 00:45:36,765
If his Pokémon partner is
still alive, that means he is too.

661
00:45:36,766 --> 00:45:39,626
- That is not proof, son.
- Tell him about the chemical "R".

662
00:45:39,627 --> 00:45:42,799
Give me a minute. Harry's last case
had to do with those underground battles.

663
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,548
That's why he was there.
There's a chemical..

664
00:45:44,549 --> 00:45:46,824
- We ran an investigation...
- Harry figured it out...

665
00:45:46,825 --> 00:45:48,258
- and it is over!
- and got in trouble for it.

666
00:45:48,259 --> 00:45:51,005
Re-open the investigation, he
is out there, i can feel it.

667
00:45:51,006 --> 00:45:53,156
- In your jellys, go ahead say it.
- I'm not gonna say that.

668
00:45:53,157 --> 00:45:55,819
I can feel it, lieutenant,
in my bones.

669
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,678
- Not as good.
- Stop.

670
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:02,004
Oh yeah and i.. can understand
Pikachu like.. we are perfect.

671
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:05,126
Tim...

672
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:08,216
It's very difficult
coping with loss.

673
00:46:08,217 --> 00:46:10,827
- Denial can be a...
- No i'm not in denial!

674
00:46:10,828 --> 00:46:14,086
I'm right, i know it.
He is, he's out there.

675
00:46:20,326 --> 00:46:22,534
I never wanted to show you this

676
00:46:22,535 --> 00:46:24,953
but i think it's important you see it.

677
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:35,930
No one could survive
a crash like that

678
00:46:36,242 --> 00:46:38,182
not even your dad.

679
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:43,466
He's gone, Tim.

680
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:56,650
Should've gotten on that train.

681
00:46:59,607 --> 00:47:01,031
What's that kid?

682
00:47:03,956 --> 00:47:05,696
After my mom died

683
00:47:06,898 --> 00:47:09,164
my dad and i drifted apart

684
00:47:10,078 --> 00:47:11,811
he moved here and..

685
00:47:11,812 --> 00:47:14,181
Poured himself into his work.

686
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:19,235
Eventually he tried to get me
to come live with him but

687
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:21,954
i wouldn't go.

688
00:47:23,217 --> 00:47:24,773
How come?

689
00:47:29,562 --> 00:47:31,662
I didn't think he cared.

690
00:47:34,041 --> 00:47:36,636
I guess i just got used to him

691
00:47:36,994 --> 00:47:39,664
not being around and

692
00:47:40,217 --> 00:47:43,552
i couldn't forgive him for it

693
00:47:44,809 --> 00:47:48,640
until i got here, and..

694
00:47:50,276 --> 00:47:52,471
For all that i saw, he did care

695
00:47:54,716 --> 00:47:58,147
but i didn't know

696
00:47:58,989 --> 00:48:02,109
'cause i've never give him the chance

697
00:48:02,966 --> 00:48:06,324
and now it's too late.

698
00:48:10,267 --> 00:48:11,795
I really..

699
00:48:14,653 --> 00:48:17,567
I really wish i had
got on that train.

700
00:48:24,382 --> 00:48:25,799
Listen kid,

701
00:48:28,121 --> 00:48:30,685
i mean i don't have memories

702
00:48:31,776 --> 00:48:33,442
but i know this much:

703
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,512
it wasn't your fault.

704
00:48:39,745 --> 00:48:42,018
Wasn't anybody's fault

705
00:48:44,173 --> 00:48:46,875
and i'm sure that if
your dad was here,

706
00:48:48,631 --> 00:48:52,827
he would hug you so hard,
your bones would pop..

707
00:48:53,665 --> 00:48:56,668
And he'd tell you he is
sorry for everything

708
00:48:59,148 --> 00:49:01,972
He'd be damn proud kid.

709
00:49:05,661 --> 00:49:07,990
I haven't been really nice to you.

710
00:49:07,991 --> 00:49:09,856
No you really haven't.

711
00:49:13,925 --> 00:49:15,344
Well...

712
00:49:16,513 --> 00:49:18,497
we still got one Mystery to solve.

713
00:49:18,498 --> 00:49:20,866
- What?
- Yours.

714
00:49:22,533 --> 00:49:24,769
Let's find out who
did this to you.

715
00:49:25,336 --> 00:49:28,257
- Get your memory back.
- I'd like that.

716
00:49:29,262 --> 00:49:31,101
I'd like that very much.

717
00:49:34,994 --> 00:49:36,893
Well that's a bad guy car.

718
00:49:55,295 --> 00:49:56,816
Thank you, Miss Norman.

719
00:49:56,817 --> 00:49:59,123
Yes thank you, Miss Norman.
That would be all.

720
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:01,529
What a blabbermouth.

721
00:50:02,102 --> 00:50:04,491
Please, come in.

722
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:11,881
Magnificent creatures, aren't they.

723
00:50:18,288 --> 00:50:21,345
Woah, a Flareon.

724
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:25,519
Imagine being able to evolve

725
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,978
to the best possible
version of yourself.

726
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:32,599
That greatness inside you,

727
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,269
just waiting to be awoken.

728
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:41,471
- Hello, Tim.
- He knows you?

729
00:50:41,472 --> 00:50:44,340
I see you partnered
with Harry's Pikachu.

730
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:47,476
- And he knows me too.
- You knew Harry?

731
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:49,905
The case Harry was working on,

732
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:54,384
- it was for me.
- That's a twist. That's very twisty.

733
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:58,387
This compound threatens
everything i've built.

734
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,423
He knows about the "R".
How does he know about the "R"?

735
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:03,426
I hired Harry to trace
it to it's source.

736
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:06,120
Imagine my shock
when the answer

737
00:51:06,121 --> 00:51:09,092
turned out to be my own son.

738
00:51:10,673 --> 00:51:13,653
I've devoted my life to
perfecting the partnership

739
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:15,719
between Pokémon and humans.

740
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:19,121
A partnership were Pokémon
bring out the best in us.

741
00:51:19,122 --> 00:51:21,308
In doing so i'm
afraid i neglected

742
00:51:21,309 --> 00:51:23,960
my responsibilities as a parent.

743
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:29,028
Roger resents the Pokémon.

744
00:51:29,029 --> 00:51:32,207
I think he's lived in
my shadow for so long

745
00:51:32,208 --> 00:51:35,241
he actually wants
to destroy my legacy.

746
00:51:35,242 --> 00:51:38,094
Well there's no such thing
as daddy issues without daddy.

747
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,441
But Mr. Clifford how could
you let him do that?

748
00:51:40,442 --> 00:51:43,602
Ever since my illness put
me in this chair

749
00:51:43,603 --> 00:51:46,689
Roger has taken over more
and more of the company,

750
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:50,779
he controls the board, he also controls
the police and the politicians

751
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,880
and he owns the press.

752
00:51:52,881 --> 00:51:56,099
Harry is the only one i can trust,

753
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:59,091
that's why you need to find him.

754
00:51:59,507 --> 00:52:02,819
You haven't heard.
Harry is dead.

755
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,374
Oh no, Tim.

756
00:52:05,382 --> 00:52:08,958
Your father is alive.

757
00:52:11,981 --> 00:52:13,491
Look out Tim!

758
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:20,139
Advanced Holographic Imaging.

759
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,543
Since being confined to this chair,

760
00:52:22,544 --> 00:52:27,510
i've invested in ways of
bringing the world to me.

761
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:30,011
This was recreated from police footage,

762
00:52:30,012 --> 00:52:32,585
it allows us to see
things that they cannot

763
00:52:32,586 --> 00:52:35,366
or don't want us to see.

764
00:52:37,114 --> 00:52:38,685
He is alive.

765
00:52:39,101 --> 00:52:41,040
- Pika...
- It's me,

766
00:52:41,041 --> 00:52:43,741
- i was with Harry in the crash.
- He needs my help.

767
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:49,079
If Harry is alive
why they didn't find him?

768
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,872
- What is that?
- Mewtwo.

769
00:52:58,873 --> 00:53:01,272
A man-made abomination.

770
00:53:01,273 --> 00:53:03,641
Created in a
laboratory using DNA

771
00:53:03,642 --> 00:53:06,826
from the fossil remains
of the ancient Mew.

772
00:53:06,827 --> 00:53:08,384
I can't believe it.

773
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:10,577
If that thing came from Mew,

774
00:53:10,578 --> 00:53:13,708
then we are looking at the most
powerful Pokémon in the world.

775
00:53:19,669 --> 00:53:22,498
That's it! That's
what happened to me.

776
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:25,435
Mewtwo wiped my memory.

777
00:53:25,436 --> 00:53:27,043
But why?

778
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:33,486
Wait, wait, wait!

779
00:53:40,778 --> 00:53:45,281
- Wait, where did he take him?
- That's for you to solve now.

780
00:53:45,282 --> 00:53:49,882
Find Mewtwo and you
will find your father.

781
00:53:53,314 --> 00:53:56,052
Second chances are
special things kid.

782
00:53:56,053 --> 00:53:58,059
There's a lot we can make better
if we crack this case.

783
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:00,299
One question though,
where are we going?

784
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:03,346
I don't know, i'm just going, you gotta
tell me where, you are the detective.

785
00:54:03,347 --> 00:54:06,521
Ok, if Roger Clifford
is the key to all of this,

786
00:54:06,522 --> 00:54:09,361
then we need someone
who has access to him.

787
00:54:09,362 --> 00:54:11,155
And we both know who that is.

788
00:54:11,156 --> 00:54:15,163
- Lover boy.
- Ok, come on, let's not start that again.

789
00:54:21,819 --> 00:54:25,044
- There she is.
- What's with the sunglasses?

790
00:54:25,045 --> 00:54:27,530
Can she see us?
I don't think she can see us.

791
00:54:27,531 --> 00:54:30,523
- Ehi, thanks for coming.
- Don't talk to me.

792
00:54:31,729 --> 00:54:33,129
Ok.

793
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,263
- What happens now?
- Just act casual..

794
00:54:36,264 --> 00:54:37,921
But don't look at me.

795
00:54:39,174 --> 00:54:41,235
There's nothing really
casual about this.

796
00:54:42,197 --> 00:54:43,762
Look at this.

797
00:54:44,475 --> 00:54:45,875
I'm sorry.

798
00:54:45,876 --> 00:54:47,777
- My fault.
- Sorry.. i'm sorry.

799
00:54:47,778 --> 00:54:51,681
- Oh it's working out great, why you don't just have her sit over here?
- You want to come just sit with us?

800
00:54:51,682 --> 00:54:53,683
I should have never encouraged
you, you have no chance.

801
00:54:53,684 --> 00:54:56,819
- I got access to Roger's computer.
- Oh wow, how did you do that?

802
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:59,387
- Spilled the cappuccino on his lap.
- It sounds like a waste of coffee.

803
00:54:59,388 --> 00:55:02,410
So i searched through all his records i
targeted the property rights in the region,

804
00:55:02,411 --> 00:55:05,176
and cross-checked that with city records
for any Clifford's finance businesses

805
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:06,763
until i've found...

806
00:55:06,764 --> 00:55:09,474
May i present: PCL.

807
00:55:09,475 --> 00:55:11,999
A Pokémon genetic research facility.

808
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,703
- But that's not all.
- She is good.

809
00:55:13,704 --> 00:55:16,417
Last week, PCL had an accident

810
00:55:16,418 --> 00:55:18,136
and had to shutdown their entire facility.

811
00:55:18,137 --> 00:55:20,710
That's the same night
Harry Goodman went missing.

812
00:55:20,711 --> 00:55:25,161
No one knows what happened.
Total media blackout.

813
00:55:25,162 --> 00:55:27,287
What does it all mean?
I don't know.

814
00:55:27,288 --> 00:55:29,143
This is very exciting.
Are you excited?

815
00:55:29,144 --> 00:55:31,080
- Yeah.
- I think he just peed a little.

816
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:33,723
- So...
- No, no, that's me. That was me.

817
00:55:33,724 --> 00:55:37,270
So, uhm, there's a cover up.

818
00:55:37,271 --> 00:55:38,701
But...

819
00:55:39,864 --> 00:55:41,724
what are they covering up?

820
00:55:42,733 --> 00:55:45,025
What do you say we go find out?

821
00:56:01,652 --> 00:56:04,098
So let me get this right.
We are forced to listen

822
00:56:04,099 --> 00:56:06,658
to this SPA music
so your head doesn't explode

823
00:56:06,659 --> 00:56:09,068
- and kill us all?
- Psyduck.

824
00:56:09,385 --> 00:56:11,819
Your Pikachu it's so unusual.

825
00:56:12,532 --> 00:56:14,413
- Psyduck?
- Ehi you put that down.

826
00:56:14,414 --> 00:56:17,346
- I'm not getting you a massage.
- Psyduck.

827
00:56:17,347 --> 00:56:19,669
I've never known a
Pokémon to wear a hat.

828
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:22,639
Yeah he is weird.
He is so weird.

829
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,467
Of course i care about
my partner's life.

830
00:56:24,468 --> 00:56:26,353
Fine, fine,
hand it over.

831
00:56:26,811 --> 00:56:28,554
What are you doing?

832
00:56:28,555 --> 00:56:30,012
What?

833
00:56:30,013 --> 00:56:34,261
Nothing, i was actually
wondering who this was.

834
00:56:35,619 --> 00:56:38,688
It's PCL chief scientist,
Dr. Ann Laurent.

835
00:56:38,689 --> 00:56:40,934
I bet this is the doctor
shirtless was talking about.

836
00:56:40,935 --> 00:56:43,489
She lost her university grant
over a experimentation of Pokémon

837
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:45,827
because she was trying to
control their minds.

838
00:56:46,401 --> 00:56:48,781
She is essentially a
neurologist for Pokémon.

839
00:56:48,782 --> 00:56:51,516
Maybe this doctor could weigh in
on the long term psychological effects

840
00:56:51,517 --> 00:56:55,810
of being strapped into a
baby seat, next to a bomb.

841
00:56:59,777 --> 00:57:01,909
This is it.

842
00:57:04,247 --> 00:57:07,180
Look at the signs.

843
00:57:07,181 --> 00:57:09,652
It must have been a
really bad accident.

844
00:57:09,653 --> 00:57:11,453
Or that's what they
want you to believe.

845
00:57:11,734 --> 00:57:15,643
Whoever staged this did an excellent job, those
signs are the perfect scarecrow for suckers.

846
00:57:15,644 --> 00:57:17,436
- Yeah well they're working on me.
- Psyduck.

847
00:57:17,437 --> 00:57:20,049
Kid this dame is looking for danger.

848
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:22,772
You want to win her over you
gotta lead her straight to it.

849
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:25,193
Ok, first of all women don't
like to be called dame.

850
00:57:25,194 --> 00:57:29,319
Second, women appreciate
calm, level headed

851
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:33,132
and responsible decision making..
What is she doing?

852
00:57:33,133 --> 00:57:34,533
Ehi, ehi, ehi, ehi!

853
00:57:35,095 --> 00:57:38,712
Ehi, Lucy, what are you doing?

854
00:57:38,713 --> 00:57:42,226
I'm cutting the fence
so that we can slip through.

855
00:57:42,227 --> 00:57:43,779
No.. Where did you get those?

856
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:45,726
- Oh don't worry about it.
- After you sir.

857
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:47,401
- Psyduck
- No? Ok i'll go first..

858
00:57:47,402 --> 00:57:50,199
- Whatever is most common.
- Psyduck.

859
00:58:10,689 --> 00:58:12,663
Psyduck, Psyduck.

860
00:58:19,937 --> 00:58:22,413
It's ok.
You can stay up there.

861
00:58:29,947 --> 00:58:31,946
I have amnesia but,

862
00:58:31,947 --> 00:58:34,891
i'm pretty sure this is the worst
idea anyone has ever had.

863
00:58:37,921 --> 00:58:39,382
What is that?

864
00:58:40,891 --> 00:58:42,420
I'm not sure.

865
00:58:45,601 --> 00:58:47,728
Psyduck!

866
00:58:49,208 --> 00:58:52,935
It's Greninja.
They don't look right.

867
00:58:52,936 --> 00:58:56,517
Test 22, power enhancement?

868
00:58:58,749 --> 00:59:00,418
They were experimenting on them.

869
00:59:00,419 --> 00:59:03,210
Why? If Roger Clifford
it's behind this,

870
00:59:03,211 --> 00:59:05,940
what's he doing
experimenting on Pokémon?

871
00:59:13,103 --> 00:59:15,336
Torterra garden.

872
00:59:21,091 --> 00:59:24,787
Pokémon evolution test 33:
Growth Enhancement.

873
00:59:25,211 --> 00:59:27,850
They look normal size to me.

874
00:59:27,851 --> 00:59:30,174
Maybe it hasn't started yet.

875
00:59:30,851 --> 00:59:34,800
It's like they are trying to
manipulate Pokémon evolution.

876
00:59:35,364 --> 00:59:37,276
Is that possible?

877
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:39,255
I don't know.

878
00:59:39,803 --> 00:59:42,526
I need to document all of this though.

879
00:59:47,858 --> 00:59:49,417
<i>You go ahead,
i'll catch up to you.</i>

880
00:59:49,418 --> 00:59:50,818
<i>- Are you sure?
- Yeah.</i>

881
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:11,546
What happened here?

882
01:00:11,547 --> 01:00:15,203
The bad stuff.
Really bad stuff.

883
01:00:15,898 --> 01:00:18,020
Still think this was staged?

884
01:00:24,744 --> 01:00:27,294
Kid, ehi over here.

885
01:00:28,222 --> 01:00:30,432
It says Dr. Laurent station.

886
01:00:31,159 --> 01:00:32,932
Looks like it's still working.

887
01:00:42,188 --> 01:00:44,649
<i>Remote Access initiated.</i>

888
01:00:50,827 --> 01:00:53,658
Psyduck.

889
01:00:59,256 --> 01:01:01,349
Looks like most of the
files are corrupted.

890
01:01:03,719 --> 01:01:05,773
Not another one of those holograms?

891
01:01:16,733 --> 01:01:18,886
Day 42.

892
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:20,872
After much trial and errors

893
01:01:20,873 --> 01:01:23,013
we perfected a stable method

894
01:01:23,014 --> 01:01:25,840
to extract Mewtwo DNA.

895
01:01:26,275 --> 01:01:28,222
It's Mewtwo, no way.

896
01:01:28,223 --> 01:01:30,678
Wait Mewtwo came from this place?

897
01:01:32,335 --> 01:01:36,688
Day 60, clinical trials
proven successful.

898
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:40,093
The inhalant results
in confusion

899
01:01:40,094 --> 01:01:43,081
and the total loss
of free will,

900
01:01:43,082 --> 01:01:47,134
which in time makes
the Pokémon go wild.

901
01:01:47,527 --> 01:01:51,878
We designated this chemical
as serum: "R".

902
01:01:54,147 --> 01:01:55,677
They used Mewtwo to make "R".

903
01:01:55,678 --> 01:01:58,649
And they were testing it,
at the battles.

904
01:02:01,896 --> 01:02:04,547
Day 68.

905
01:02:04,548 --> 01:02:07,447
The neural link is operational.

906
01:02:07,448 --> 01:02:09,713
<i>Alert: condition red</i>

907
01:02:10,182 --> 01:02:12,917
<i>Alert! Alert!
Alert!</i>

908
01:02:13,276 --> 01:02:15,460
No! No! No!

909
01:02:15,461 --> 01:02:17,711
We are losing power in the
containment chamber!

910
01:02:29,185 --> 01:02:31,138
That must have been
how Mewtwo escaped.

911
01:02:31,139 --> 01:02:32,599
Now we are getting somewhere.

912
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,733
- But what did that thing want with Harry?
- Good question kid.

913
01:02:35,734 --> 01:02:37,990
I'll try to take us
back to the beginning.

914
01:02:44,412 --> 01:02:47,647
Day 1 the lab is almost
fully operational.

915
01:02:47,648 --> 01:02:49,388
All that remains now is

916
01:02:49,389 --> 01:02:52,845
to capture the most powerful
Pokémon known to mankind:

917
01:02:52,846 --> 01:02:54,479
Mewtwo.

918
01:02:54,917 --> 01:02:59,025
It escaped nearly 20 years ago
from the Kanto region.

919
01:02:59,026 --> 01:03:02,525
Fortunately i've hired a
specialist to track it down.

920
01:03:02,526 --> 01:03:04,487
Good luck, detective Goodman.

921
01:03:10,987 --> 01:03:13,080
That's why Mewtwo took Harry.

922
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:15,324
Was revenge for being captured.

923
01:03:15,325 --> 01:03:16,880
This doesn't make any sense!

924
01:03:16,881 --> 01:03:19,591
- Harry would've never been a part of this.
- I wanna believe that kid.

925
01:03:19,592 --> 01:03:22,353
We gotta be honest here, you haven't
seen him in years and i got amnesia,

926
01:03:22,354 --> 01:03:25,171
neither of us can say for sure
what Harry would or wouldn't do.

927
01:03:25,172 --> 01:03:26,696
We gotta get back to the city.

928
01:03:26,697 --> 01:03:28,672
Lucy!
Lucy!

929
01:03:28,673 --> 01:03:30,204
We gotta get back to...

930
01:03:34,051 --> 01:03:35,559
Lucy?

931
01:03:37,137 --> 01:03:38,606
Lucy?

932
01:03:45,922 --> 01:03:48,379
That wasn't not there before, kid.

933
01:03:51,236 --> 01:03:52,736
Eew!

934
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,654
Kid, the fire alarm!

935
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:10,842
Psyduck!

936
01:04:10,843 --> 01:04:12,694
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

937
01:04:16,873 --> 01:04:20,117
- Go back.
- Psyduck!

938
01:04:26,656 --> 01:04:28,572
Psyduck. Psyduck.

939
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:30,855
Get down!

940
01:04:30,856 --> 01:04:32,910
Psyduck.

941
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,287
Run!

942
01:04:37,625 --> 01:04:42,532
Psyduck! Psyduck! Psyduck!
Psyduck! Psyduck! Psyduck!

943
01:04:42,533 --> 01:04:45,204
Psyduck! Psyduck! Psyduck!
Psyduck! Psyduck! Psyduck!

944
01:04:48,246 --> 01:04:50,395
Psyduck! Psyduck! Psyduck!

945
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:55,196
- Psyduck!
- It's ok, it's ok Psyduck! I mean it's fine!

946
01:04:55,197 --> 01:04:56,965
He is gonna blow his head, kid.

947
01:04:56,966 --> 01:04:59,514
It's ok, Psyduck.
It's ok!

948
01:05:00,683 --> 01:05:02,847
Psyduck!

949
01:05:04,078 --> 01:05:06,085
This is no time for your
stupid headache.

950
01:05:06,086 --> 01:05:07,733
No, wait, wait,

951
01:05:07,734 --> 01:05:09,954
this is the perfect time
to get a headache.

952
01:05:09,955 --> 01:05:12,463
- Psyduck.
- I hated rubbing your feet!

953
01:05:12,464 --> 01:05:13,871
Psyduck, psyduck!

954
01:05:13,872 --> 01:05:15,646
I'll never forget my hands
for what they did.

955
01:05:15,647 --> 01:05:18,302
Get a splitting headache now,
you neurotic duck!

956
01:05:18,303 --> 01:05:20,265
- Do it! Do it!
- Psyduck!

957
01:05:20,266 --> 01:05:24,015
- Psyduck!
- Do it!

958
01:05:30,596 --> 01:05:34,018
- Psy... duck.
- Good job, Psyduck.

959
01:05:34,019 --> 01:05:35,589
Where is my hat?

960
01:05:41,299 --> 01:05:43,002
Something's wrong.

961
01:05:59,112 --> 01:06:00,987
This isn't really happening.

962
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:03,144
Don't worry.

963
01:06:03,145 --> 01:06:06,097
Psyduck psionic waves are
causing hallucinations,

964
01:06:06,098 --> 01:06:07,784
none of this is real.

965
01:06:08,441 --> 01:06:11,004
All of this is real!
Run!

966
01:06:20,793 --> 01:06:22,303
What's happening?

967
01:06:22,304 --> 01:06:23,773
We are falling down!

968
01:06:25,785 --> 01:06:27,185
At this point...

969
01:06:27,186 --> 01:06:30,569
how can you not believe
in climate change?

970
01:06:43,789 --> 01:06:45,528
No!

971
01:06:45,529 --> 01:06:47,451
I've got you.

972
01:06:47,452 --> 01:06:48,852
Tim!

973
01:06:50,903 --> 01:06:53,042
Run!

974
01:06:53,621 --> 01:06:55,800
Go! Go! Go!

975
01:06:56,293 --> 01:06:59,010
Go! Go!

976
01:07:12,687 --> 01:07:14,184
We made it.

977
01:07:14,804 --> 01:07:17,496
I officially hate this forest.

978
01:07:25,699 --> 01:07:27,099
Tim!

979
01:07:27,655 --> 01:07:30,014
- Lucy!
- Tim!

980
01:07:41,751 --> 01:07:43,301
The walls are closing in.

981
01:07:43,302 --> 01:07:45,746
We have to do something,
and we gotta do it fast.

982
01:07:45,747 --> 01:07:48,592
- I'm gonna jump for it.
- That's a great fifth option,

983
01:07:48,593 --> 01:07:51,419
- let's work on the first four.
- You are not gonna make it!

984
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:53,209
- There's no other choice.
- We have a lot of choices,

985
01:07:53,210 --> 01:07:55,390
only going down is
not one of them.

986
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:07,971
Come on!

987
01:08:10,976 --> 01:08:12,576
Never thought...

988
01:08:12,577 --> 01:08:13,977
i thought it was gonna...

989
01:08:14,288 --> 01:08:16,108
Eye, eye...

990
01:08:16,852 --> 01:08:19,171
- eyeball.
- Eyeball.

991
01:08:19,172 --> 01:08:20,572
Eyeball!

992
01:08:32,992 --> 01:08:34,392
I get it!

993
01:08:35,135 --> 01:08:38,197
I get it now, this
isn't a forest at all!

994
01:08:38,678 --> 01:08:42,747
This is the Torterra Garden!

995
01:08:50,487 --> 01:08:51,887
Pikachu!

996
01:09:22,406 --> 01:09:23,806
He is alright!

997
01:09:26,351 --> 01:09:28,795
- Is he ok?
- I'm in bad shape kid.

998
01:09:28,796 --> 01:09:30,741
I'm your partner,
i'm here.

999
01:09:33,054 --> 01:09:34,890
Did you just called
me a partner?

1000
01:09:34,891 --> 01:09:36,811
Yeah of course!
You are my partner.

1001
01:09:36,812 --> 01:09:38,492
Oh that's right, i'm your par...

1002
01:09:40,297 --> 01:09:41,697
You've got my back.

1003
01:09:43,488 --> 01:09:44,902
Buddy!

1004
01:09:47,281 --> 01:09:48,681
Pikachu!

1005
01:09:49,766 --> 01:09:51,166
Pikachu!

1006
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,440
No.

1007
01:10:01,063 --> 01:10:03,483
Help!
Please!

1008
01:10:03,804 --> 01:10:05,204
Please!

1009
01:10:05,921 --> 01:10:07,321
He is hurt!

1010
01:10:08,085 --> 01:10:09,485
Please!

1011
01:10:12,507 --> 01:10:14,640
He doesn't know what
you are saying.

1012
01:10:19,992 --> 01:10:21,789
But he knows what
i'm feeling.

1013
01:10:25,173 --> 01:10:27,977
I need to get Pikachu
to a healer Pokémon.

1014
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:30,370
Please.

1015
01:10:31,607 --> 01:10:33,007
I'm begging you.

1016
01:10:34,302 --> 01:10:36,122
I don't wanna lose him too.

1017
01:10:51,308 --> 01:10:52,708
It's ok.

1018
01:11:02,314 --> 01:11:04,112
Tim, look.

1019
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:33,639
Ok.

1020
01:11:35,876 --> 01:11:37,276
I'll wait you at the car.

1021
01:12:13,649 --> 01:12:15,228
You are gonna be ok, partner.

1022
01:13:06,045 --> 01:13:07,445
Here?

1023
01:13:19,411 --> 01:13:22,028
Wait! Wait!
Where are you going?

1024
01:13:22,724 --> 01:13:24,362
What am i supposed to do?

1025
01:13:25,036 --> 01:13:27,782
I've been waiting for you

1026
01:13:32,436 --> 01:13:33,844
Mewtwo.

1027
01:13:36,112 --> 01:13:37,538
No! No!
Wait!

1028
01:13:55,707 --> 01:13:57,129
Where am i?

1029
01:13:57,510 --> 01:13:58,910
You are ok!

1030
01:13:58,911 --> 01:14:02,263
Yeah i.. somehow i'm fine!

1031
01:14:02,264 --> 01:14:05,785
You brought the son to me,
as we agreed.

1032
01:14:06,738 --> 01:14:10,244
- What is he talking about?
- I don't know kid, i'm lost as you are.

1033
01:14:10,836 --> 01:14:12,573
Where is my father?

1034
01:14:12,574 --> 01:14:14,289
What did you do with him?

1035
01:14:25,823 --> 01:14:27,228
<i>Alert!</i>

1036
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:29,721
We are losing power in the
containment chamber!

1037
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:39,131
You've done well.

1038
01:14:39,791 --> 01:14:42,076
Humanity is evil.

1039
01:14:42,678 --> 01:14:44,865
I always believed Pokémon...

1040
01:14:47,294 --> 01:14:48,912
No!

1041
01:15:24,495 --> 01:15:28,831
Wait, wait, wait.
Pikachu Wait.

1042
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:32,323
Ehi! Slow down, we
have to talk about this.

1043
01:15:32,324 --> 01:15:33,878
You'll to go on without me.

1044
01:15:34,596 --> 01:15:37,306
What? What are you saying?
Roger has Mewtwo.

1045
01:15:37,307 --> 01:15:40,344
Mewtwo has my father. We are running
out of time, we got a case to solve.

1046
01:15:40,345 --> 01:15:42,525
We already solved mine.
I know who i am.

1047
01:15:42,526 --> 01:15:44,533
I'm the guy who betrayed Harry.

1048
01:15:44,933 --> 01:15:46,365
We don't know that.

1049
01:15:46,366 --> 01:15:48,749
We both saw i betrayed your father.

1050
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:50,619
Which means...

1051
01:15:51,601 --> 01:15:54,146
- i could betray you too.
- You wouldn't do that.

1052
01:15:54,147 --> 01:15:56,337
I don't care what i saw,
i know who you are.

1053
01:15:56,338 --> 01:15:57,971
- How do you know?
- Because i..

1054
01:15:58,775 --> 01:16:01,515
- I can feel it in my jellys.
- I made that up.

1055
01:16:01,516 --> 01:16:04,562
- There's no jellys. There's no me.
- I don't believe that.

1056
01:16:04,563 --> 01:16:08,095
- You're better off on your own.
- Come on, Pikachu.

1057
01:16:08,096 --> 01:16:10,467
- I need you, please.
- No you have to stay away, it's for your own good.

1058
01:16:10,468 --> 01:16:12,132
No i'm not letting you go.

1059
01:16:17,661 --> 01:16:19,061
You see?

1060
01:16:20,344 --> 01:16:23,211
I can't help it, i hurt
the people who need me.

1061
01:16:23,973 --> 01:16:25,575
That's who i am.

1062
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:27,717
I'm sorry.

1063
01:16:29,579 --> 01:16:31,009
I'm sorry.

1064
01:16:31,391 --> 01:16:32,798
Tim.

1065
01:16:33,962 --> 01:16:37,669
Where is he going?
What happened?

1066
01:16:38,678 --> 01:16:40,588
It's Pikachu ok?

1067
01:16:40,977 --> 01:16:42,937
No he's not.

1068
01:16:43,961 --> 01:16:46,217
Let's go we gotta get
back to the city.

1069
01:16:52,977 --> 01:16:55,788
<i>The 10º anniversary
Rhyme City Pokémon Parade</i>

1070
01:16:55,789 --> 01:16:57,867
<i>is set to begin this afternoon.</i>

1071
01:16:57,868 --> 01:17:02,414
<i>The whole city is converging on downtown,
to watch the day's festivities</i>

1072
01:17:09,518 --> 01:17:12,681
I don't know what happened between
you two, but we need to strategize.

1073
01:17:12,682 --> 01:17:14,088
Wait, where are you going?

1074
01:17:14,089 --> 01:17:16,846
We need to tell the public what
we found! This is breaking news!

1075
01:17:16,847 --> 01:17:19,298
No, you should break the news.

1076
01:17:19,299 --> 01:17:21,089
You, i'm gonna go talk to Howard.

1077
01:17:22,214 --> 01:17:23,619
Tim?

1078
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:25,032
How am i supposed to break the news

1079
01:17:25,033 --> 01:17:27,955
when the guy that runs the news
is the breaking news?

1080
01:17:33,931 --> 01:17:36,641
- Stay in the car, ok?
- Psyduck.

1081
01:17:50,327 --> 01:17:52,559
Missis McMaster, hi.
It's Lucy Stevens,

1082
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:55,086
- the intern at CNM.
- Could you?

1083
01:17:55,087 --> 01:17:58,107
Yeah, uhm i have a story
that's really important

1084
01:17:58,108 --> 01:18:00,914
and the people need to know,
i was wondering if you could help me tell it.

1085
01:18:00,915 --> 01:18:05,256
Lucy, please, take my coffee order.
Latte, extra sugar.

1086
01:18:08,512 --> 01:18:11,301
You got it. Cynthia.

1087
01:18:11,614 --> 01:18:14,825
<i>Searching far and wide.</i>

1088
01:18:14,826 --> 01:18:17,916
<i>Each Pokemon to understand</i>

1089
01:18:17,917 --> 01:18:21,148
<i>The power that's inside!</i>

1090
01:18:21,149 --> 01:18:24,907
<i>Pokémon!
Gotta catch 'em all</i>

1091
01:18:24,908 --> 01:18:26,712
<i>It's you and me</i>

1092
01:18:26,713 --> 01:18:29,422
<i>I know it's my destiny</i>

1093
01:18:29,423 --> 01:18:30,909
<i>Pokémon!</i>

1094
01:18:33,127 --> 01:18:34,846
What is this?

1095
01:18:40,471 --> 01:18:42,143
I know this place.

1096
01:18:45,903 --> 01:18:47,787
This is the scene of the crash.

1097
01:18:50,593 --> 01:18:51,993
What is that?

1098
01:18:55,370 --> 01:18:56,928
Greninja stars.

1099
01:19:00,683 --> 01:19:03,772
Roger must have sent the
Greninja to cause the crash.

1100
01:19:04,589 --> 01:19:06,170
Which means...

1101
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:09,199
Mewtwo was trying to protect us?

1102
01:19:11,877 --> 01:19:14,127
<i>Advanced Holographic Imaging</i>

1103
01:19:14,128 --> 01:19:16,644
<i>it allows us to see
things that they cannot</i>

1104
01:19:16,645 --> 01:19:18,782
<i>- or don't want us to see.</i>
- Wait..

1105
01:19:19,490 --> 01:19:21,825
Howard would've seen
this in his hologram.

1106
01:19:21,826 --> 01:19:23,834
Oh no! No, no, no.

1107
01:19:23,835 --> 01:19:25,235
Tim!

1108
01:19:25,909 --> 01:19:27,659
Howard!
Mr. Clifford.

1109
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:29,060
Your son...

1110
01:19:29,385 --> 01:19:30,997
Has Mewtwo here.

1111
01:19:31,448 --> 01:19:33,136
- Wait, what?
- Tim.

1112
01:19:33,598 --> 01:19:35,237
It's gonna be ok.

1113
01:19:43,285 --> 01:19:45,437
Run!

1114
01:20:05,598 --> 01:20:07,941
The transfer worked.

1115
01:20:08,783 --> 01:20:11,240
My body is in the chair,

1116
01:20:12,266 --> 01:20:15,618
but my mind it is in Mewtwo.

1117
01:20:16,112 --> 01:20:18,674
- Howard?
- Well done, Tim.

1118
01:20:18,675 --> 01:20:22,810
You and Harry's Pikachu lead
me straight to Mewtwo.

1119
01:20:23,231 --> 01:20:24,734
Mewtwo didn't cause the crash.

1120
01:20:24,735 --> 01:20:26,306
All your father had to do

1121
01:20:26,307 --> 01:20:28,679
was take the money and walk away.

1122
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:30,749
But he started asking questions.

1123
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:32,940
- I had to stop him.
- You tried to kill him!

1124
01:20:32,941 --> 01:20:34,341
I had no choice!

1125
01:20:34,342 --> 01:20:36,476
He tracked the "R" to the battles.

1126
01:20:36,477 --> 01:20:38,487
Traced it back to Dr. Laurent.

1127
01:20:38,488 --> 01:20:41,713
And then him and his Pikachu
helped Mewtwo escape.

1128
01:20:45,830 --> 01:20:49,405
So as you can see, we are more
than happy with the turn out today.

1129
01:20:49,406 --> 01:20:50,934
So many families...

1130
01:20:50,935 --> 01:20:52,751
Thank you so much. Thank you.
That's all. Thank you.

1131
01:20:54,103 --> 01:20:55,645
Excuse me, please.
Hello.

1132
01:20:55,646 --> 01:20:57,481
Hi. I have an interview.

1133
01:20:57,482 --> 01:20:59,256
- With the mayor...
- Go on please.

1134
01:21:00,062 --> 01:21:02,735
Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor i need
to speak with you please, it's urgent.

1135
01:21:02,736 --> 01:21:05,027
- Little late for the interviews don't you think?
- Please.

1136
01:21:06,931 --> 01:21:08,647
<i>Before we begin the parade,</i>

1137
01:21:08,648 --> 01:21:11,406
<i>i'd like to thank our
benefactor Howard Clifford.</i>

1138
01:21:11,407 --> 01:21:14,145
This was never about curing me.

1139
01:21:14,146 --> 01:21:17,407
I've found a path forward
for all of us.

1140
01:21:17,408 --> 01:21:19,882
Mewtwo has the
power to transfer

1141
01:21:19,883 --> 01:21:22,469
the soul of a human
into the body of a Pokémon,

1142
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:26,449
as long as the Pokémon
are in a crazed state.

1143
01:21:26,450 --> 01:21:29,326
The "R" gas takes care of that.

1144
01:21:30,835 --> 01:21:33,723
The balloons.
The "R" gas is in the balloons.

1145
01:21:43,178 --> 01:21:45,756
People of Rhyme City.

1146
01:21:45,757 --> 01:21:48,671
I've finally discovered a cure.

1147
01:21:48,672 --> 01:21:53,495
Not just for me,
but for all of humanity.

1148
01:21:53,496 --> 01:21:57,898
Pokémon can evolve into
better versions of themselves.

1149
01:21:57,899 --> 01:22:00,655
And now, so can you.

1150
01:22:00,656 --> 01:22:02,949
Humans and Pokémon

1151
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:05,751
merged into one.

1152
01:22:17,917 --> 01:22:20,752
Don't let your Pokémon
breathe the purple gas.

1153
01:22:28,090 --> 01:22:30,602
This is Yoshida.
Requesting backup.

1154
01:22:30,603 --> 01:22:32,746
All units...

1155
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:35,774
Snubbull, no!

1156
01:22:45,525 --> 01:22:47,578
Don't let your Pokémon
breathe the gas.

1157
01:22:47,579 --> 01:22:50,800
Don't let your Pokémon
breathe the gas.

1158
01:22:53,986 --> 01:22:55,394
Come on...

1159
01:22:55,395 --> 01:22:57,179
This is Lucy Stevens
reporting a city wide emergency.

1160
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:59,020
Do not let your
Pokémon breathe...

1161
01:22:59,021 --> 01:23:00,892
Psyduck!

1162
01:23:03,306 --> 01:23:06,369
Psyduck! Psyduck!

1163
01:23:08,507 --> 01:23:10,024
Psyduck?

1164
01:23:17,975 --> 01:23:19,393
Ok.

1165
01:23:19,807 --> 01:23:21,638
Worst parade i've ever seen!

1166
01:23:21,639 --> 01:23:24,187
- Psyduck!
- Lucy? Lucy you are in there?

1167
01:23:24,350 --> 01:23:26,195
- Where is Tim?
- Psyduck, Psy.

1168
01:23:26,196 --> 01:23:30,033
- Howard is Mewtwo?
- Psyduck, Psyduck.

1169
01:23:30,808 --> 01:23:34,099
This really blows my bridge
discovery out of the water.

1170
01:23:34,599 --> 01:23:36,920
Alright.
I gotta stop this.

1171
01:23:37,348 --> 01:23:38,748
Game on.

1172
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:49,880
Ok, Pikachu.

1173
01:23:49,881 --> 01:23:51,731
Your powers are in there somewhere.

1174
01:23:51,732 --> 01:23:53,883
Just need a little spark
to get this party started.

1175
01:23:53,884 --> 01:23:55,284
Let's do this!

1176
01:24:02,610 --> 01:24:04,890
Harry's Pikachu.

1177
01:24:06,192 --> 01:24:09,593
You think you can stand
in the way of the future?

1178
01:24:09,594 --> 01:24:12,395
I am the future!

1179
01:24:54,424 --> 01:24:55,824
He is back!

1180
01:25:05,314 --> 01:25:06,930
The neural link.

1181
01:25:13,599 --> 01:25:15,000
Roger?

1182
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,440
Behind you!

1183
01:25:33,239 --> 01:25:34,639
You are a Ditto.

1184
01:25:35,551 --> 01:25:36,952
Ditto!

1185
01:25:47,912 --> 01:25:50,281
Take left!
Take right! Right!

1186
01:25:50,282 --> 01:25:53,283
Where did you learn how to fly?
The ground?

1187
01:25:53,904 --> 01:25:55,884
No, no, no, no.
Stop, stop, stop.

1188
01:25:55,885 --> 01:25:57,285
Wait, wait!

1189
01:25:57,952 --> 01:25:59,352
Wait, wait!

1190
01:26:04,491 --> 01:26:07,092
Come on, no, that's not fair.

1191
01:26:10,397 --> 01:26:13,373
Ok, for the record,
i have no guilt hitting

1192
01:26:13,374 --> 01:26:16,074
a beady-eyed version of the
woman i'm very attracted to.

1193
01:26:21,502 --> 01:26:23,275
Oh oh! Now pull up,
don't breathe the gas.

1194
01:26:24,504 --> 01:26:26,175
You breathed the gas, didn't you.

1195
01:26:52,497 --> 01:26:53,973
Ok.

1196
01:27:00,978 --> 01:27:03,931
- Finish him, Ditto!
- Ditto.

1197
01:27:14,897 --> 01:27:16,725
No!
No, no, no!

1198
01:27:22,692 --> 01:27:24,324
Pikachu!

1199
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:26,180
Tim...

1200
01:27:27,378 --> 01:27:30,397
Harry's son is finished.

1201
01:27:30,398 --> 01:27:31,798
No...

1202
01:27:31,799 --> 01:27:34,359
Tim says Volt Tackle
is my best move.

1203
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:36,779
Let's do this Pokémon Battle
thing right!

1204
01:27:46,931 --> 01:27:48,331
No!

1205
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:58,463
Give me your hand!

1206
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:05,503
What kind of a Ditto was that?

1207
01:28:05,504 --> 01:28:09,065
That was modified.
Father's genetic experiments.

1208
01:28:38,411 --> 01:28:39,904
Ditto!

1209
01:28:39,905 --> 01:28:43,820
Ditto...

1210
01:28:53,965 --> 01:28:55,465
A feeble effort!

1211
01:28:55,466 --> 01:28:59,665
A Pikachu cannot defeat
Mewtwo in battle.

1212
01:29:00,452 --> 01:29:02,480
I didn't mean to defeat you.

1213
01:29:03,081 --> 01:29:05,220
I just needed to distract you.

1214
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:12,914
No!

1215
01:29:16,299 --> 01:29:19,428
What have you done?

1216
01:29:22,005 --> 01:29:25,058
Pikachu! No!

1217
01:29:39,685 --> 01:29:41,792
- Pikachu!
- Tim!

1218
01:29:42,718 --> 01:29:45,197
- Are you ok?
- I'm sorry!

1219
01:29:45,198 --> 01:29:48,108
I'm sorry i've pushed you away
just when you needed me the most.

1220
01:29:48,458 --> 01:29:50,655
I'm just happy you are back.

1221
01:29:52,051 --> 01:29:53,593
Partner.

1222
01:29:54,930 --> 01:29:57,320
Please tell me you can
fix this mess.

1223
01:29:57,757 --> 01:30:01,335
I'm going to undo,
what has be done.

1224
01:30:32,033 --> 01:30:34,375
Let's never do that again,

1225
01:30:34,376 --> 01:30:36,002
ok?

1226
01:30:51,355 --> 01:30:54,877
The strange thing is that
no matter what his flaws

1227
01:30:54,878 --> 01:30:59,721
deep down i blame myself
for not being there for him.

1228
01:31:00,695 --> 01:31:03,180
You! You were working
on this story.

1229
01:31:03,181 --> 01:31:06,265
Had a lead on it before
anyone else even knew.

1230
01:31:06,266 --> 01:31:08,704
- That's correct.
- Good. Alright you are getting on camera!

1231
01:31:08,705 --> 01:31:12,402
I want you to give an in-depth report
for CNM tonight, prime time.

1232
01:31:12,403 --> 01:31:13,996
And make sure you close with:

1233
01:31:13,997 --> 01:31:18,475
"Roger Clifford pledges to undo
all the harm is father caused,

1234
01:31:18,476 --> 01:31:21,482
starting with the Pokémon
he experimented on."

1235
01:31:25,007 --> 01:31:26,711
I can't believe we did it.

1236
01:31:26,712 --> 01:31:28,886
- Psyduck!
- Great work!

1237
01:31:28,887 --> 01:31:31,651
Ehi calm down.
Stay calm.

1238
01:31:32,552 --> 01:31:34,974
I hope we never get
to see each other again.

1239
01:31:34,975 --> 01:31:36,896
- Meet me later tonight?
- Cool.

1240
01:31:36,897 --> 01:31:38,740
I mean, yeah!

1241
01:31:41,751 --> 01:31:44,419
- Come on.
- Psyduck, Psyduck, Psyduck.

1242
01:31:45,831 --> 01:31:47,392
Way to go, Tim!

1243
01:31:48,696 --> 01:31:52,537
There is one last
thing i must fix.

1244
01:31:56,092 --> 01:31:57,492
My father!

1245
01:31:57,852 --> 01:32:02,745
The father you have been looking
for has been with you all along.

1246
01:32:04,831 --> 01:32:06,349
What's he talking about?

1247
01:32:08,252 --> 01:32:09,652
I don't...

1248
01:32:32,165 --> 01:32:33,949
You've done well.

1249
01:32:33,950 --> 01:32:35,813
Humanity is evil!

1250
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:38,844
But you have show me...

1251
01:32:39,345 --> 01:32:41,675
that not all humans are bad.

1252
01:32:42,954 --> 01:32:44,378
Harry Goodman,

1253
01:32:44,379 --> 01:32:48,411
your Pikachu offers it's
body to save your mind.

1254
01:32:48,412 --> 01:32:49,906
There is a son.

1255
01:32:50,918 --> 01:32:54,402
With the son's return,
i can repair the father.

1256
01:32:54,950 --> 01:32:59,096
Your memory will be gone,
but your hearth will know who you are.

1257
01:33:00,196 --> 01:33:03,529
I take this body so
that you might live.

1258
01:33:04,476 --> 01:33:06,506
Return with the son!

1259
01:33:37,613 --> 01:33:39,013
Ehi, kid!

1260
01:33:56,135 --> 01:33:58,042
Grams will meet you
when you arrive.

1261
01:33:59,325 --> 01:34:00,725
Ok.

1262
01:34:07,396 --> 01:34:08,796
See ya.

1263
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:11,832
See ya.

1264
01:34:42,075 --> 01:34:43,475
Ehi dad..

1265
01:34:44,884 --> 01:34:46,284
Yeah?

1266
01:34:48,093 --> 01:34:50,291
You think i can stay
with you for a while?

1267
01:34:52,667 --> 01:34:54,448
I'd like that, kid.

1268
01:34:55,345 --> 01:34:57,214
Yeah i'd like that very much.

1269
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:02,100
Me too!

1270
01:35:13,372 --> 01:35:16,592
- You wanna get a coffee?
- It's the weirdest thing

1271
01:35:16,593 --> 01:35:19,836
It's all i've been thinking about
was having a coffee right now.

1272
01:35:20,867 --> 01:35:23,257
I think i'll have
to find a new job.

1273
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:25,118
Oh yeah?

1274
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:26,541
What are you thinking?

1275
01:35:27,445 --> 01:35:31,138
- Maybe i could give detective work a try?
- Pika-Pika.

1276
01:35:31,550 --> 01:35:33,599
I think he likes that idea.
