1
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,129
I'm sure
we're not far off.

2
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,799
I'm glad you're
sure of it, George.

3
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:47,042
Oh, shit!
Hold on! Hold on!

4
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,300
Oh, sweetie.

5
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,302
Everyone all right?
You okay?

6
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,971
Okay?
Everyone okay?

7
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,432
- You all right?
- Yeah.

8
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,121
Sit back, sit back.

9
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,417
Fuck, I think we're stuck.

10
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,647
Oh, shit.

11
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,817
How're you doing?
Hey--

12
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,860
you mind just
putting that down?

13
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,612
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

14
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,948
Where's the buck?

15
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,731
Will you guys cool it in front
of my kid, for fuck's sake?

16
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,899
- Kim, Kim.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

17
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,901
We've been after that buck
for 18 hours.

18
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,903
- I don't fucking care!
- Kim, Kim, Kim.

19
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,072
We just had an accident,
and you fire your gun

20
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,616
- 15 feet in front of my fucking car!
- Kim, cool out.

21
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,703
- Yeah, Kim, cool out.
- Hey, listen, look!

22
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,414
We're a little shook up.
Kim, just cool out for a minute.

23
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,375
- Can you tell me--
- Goddamn it!

24
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,878
Kim, cool out,
sit in the car.

25
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,379
Check on Miles.

26
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:01,176
Can you tell me who I can
call in town to get a tow?

27
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,511
Nobody open
this time of night.

28
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,597
That's just not true.

29
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:09,017
Can you tell me
the next big town?

30
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,603
Is there anywhere
closer than Danbury?

31
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,855
Hey, one of these antlers
is cracked, Otis.

32
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,244
That guy's a real treat.

33
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,288
Did they tell you
who to call?

34
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,375
No.
Let me see the map.

35
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,384
Fuck!

36
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,762
This is a bummer, right?

37
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:46,930
Yeah.

38
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,848
Were you scared
when we hit that deer?

39
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,892
- Yeah.
- You okay though?

40
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,938
- Yeah.
- Some people out here

41
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:59,067
hunt the deer
and they catch the weaker ones

42
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,112
who wouldn't survive
the winter, that's the idea.

43
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,406
But it's sad.

44
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,912
- Poor deer.
- Yeah.

45
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,956
Shit.

46
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,750
I'm about 20 miles
south of Danbury.

47
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:20,296
Um, I just passed a bridge,

48
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,173
Shadow Ridge? Shadow Creek?
Something--

49
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,216
Shadow Creek.

50
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,888
Your daddy's gonna-- daddy's gonna
get us a tow out of here.

51
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,515
Right, Dad?

52
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,560
I said it was a mile
after that bridge

53
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,937
- on Shadow Ridge, right?
- Yeah, sounds right.

54
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,647
They said half an hour.

55
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,942
Okay. Then I'm going
to make us all dinner.

56
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:44,320
Right?

57
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,172
Yeah?

58
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,883
The antler on that deer
is busted because of you.

59
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:12,140
I'm sorry for that.
I wish it hadn't happened that way.

60
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,267
That all you got to say?

61
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,895
I think we should
just leave it at that.

62
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,896
Is that right?

63
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,731
Excuse me,
can I...

64
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,274
Excuse me, excus e me.

65
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,568
Can you step away
from the car, please?

66
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,407
Can I ask you your name?

67
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,494
- Otis.
- Otis?

68
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,704
My name is George,
and I'd like you to please

69
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,831
stay away from the car,
if you don't mind.

70
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,627
My family's very upset.
We want to wait here for our ride.

71
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,671
Now, I'm sorry
about the deer.

72
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:46,716
But it was an accident,
there's nothing we can do about it.

73
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,719
I don't know how
I can be any clearer.

74
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:54,349
Rack of antlers like that
worth a lot of money.

75
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,976
Hey, Otis,
I'm gonna go get the truck.

76
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,104
- Otis.
- I'm going to get the truck.

77
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,856
Otis, what do you say?

78
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,526
I say it's my deer
and this guy busted an antler!

79
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,570
Otis, that ain't right.
We got to talk about this.

80
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,281
Billy made the first hit,
so I don't know if it's yours.

81
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,617
The fuck with that.
I had the fatal shot.

82
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,953
Billy wounded him.
This guy took him out.

83
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:18,581
And you did the mercy killing.

84
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,382
Mercy killing.

85
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,427
Excuse me.

86
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,142
Guy's a piece of work.

87
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,601
Good shot, man.

88
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,402
That guy's got a problem.

89
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,238
Goddamn.

90
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,594
Are you dead or alive?

91
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,346
Alive.

92
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,847
Are you famous?

93
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,350
Yes.

94
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,061
Are you...

95
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,396
in showbiz?

96
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,773
Yes.

97
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,859
- It's like a farewell butt, right?
- Yeah.

98
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,236
- Madonna?
- No.

99
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,571
Courtney Love?

100
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,698
No, you have to keep
asking me questions.

101
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,992
Spice Girls?

102
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,036
Don't just assume
I'm a woman.

103
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,788
I think this is
our ride.

104
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,000
What's he up to now?

105
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:49,589
Could have saved you
some trouble. We got this.

106
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:52,509
- You the one that called?
- I called. What are you doing?

107
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,053
I'm getting you out of that ditch.
You could've asked.

108
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,137
No, no, no.

109
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,556
Looks like you got yourself
a friend for life.

110
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,060
Are you going up
to the Stooky place?

111
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,524
I guess you were right, Otis.

112
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,401
You all from the city?

113
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,196
You want to give
it a go, Billy?

114
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,240
Wait. Just wait.
Wait a minute. Wait.

115
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,617
- Stand back.
- Relax.

116
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,377
Here we go.

117
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,879
Here we go.

118
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,469
Okay, okay. Thank you.

119
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:37,929
There it is.
Ha ha ha.

120
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,681
Whoo!

121
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:43,435
It's $40
just for coming up here.

122
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,272
- I won't charge you for the tow.
- Thank you.

123
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,149
I'll only charge you $20.

124
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,276
I'm not paying you
anything.

125
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,153
Look who's got a bug
up his ass.

126
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,196
Listen, I didn't ask
for your help.

127
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,240
I'd already called for the tow.
You knew that.

128
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,533
I knew what?

129
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,077
I'm not doing this.
I'm not! This is ridiculous.

130
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:05,331
I don't think I understand
what your problem is, George.

131
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,375
- I really don't.
- Here.

132
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:10,420
- Somebody's got some manners.
- George, let's go.

133
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,088
Thank you, Kim.

134
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,759
I make a point of pissing in
your drinking water once a week.

135
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,303
New York City reservoir
just a mile from here.

136
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:22,015
- That's nice.
- Don't say anything, just drive.

137
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,392
I drink bottled water anyway.
What a prick.

138
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,436
Whoo!

139
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,409
It should be to the left.
There's a bridge.

140
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,745
Bridge?
Only Richard would have a bridge.

141
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:48,208
Here we go, Miles,
over the moat.

142
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,669
The moat to the castle.

143
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,382
Richard and Annie's mansion.

144
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:59,094
Yeah. It's a tan house,
isn't it?

145
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,604
Oh, it's beautiful.
Well, of course,

146
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:11,272
it's Richard
and Annie's house.

147
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:15,026
Whoo-oo...
Richard and Annie's house.

148
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,528
George, shush.

149
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:24,119
See, babe, not even a dent.
Built to last.

150
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,079
Lap of luxury, George.

151
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,914
Hey, Miles,
look at that.

152
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,250
- Huh?
- Hmm.

153
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,419
Looks pretty old, Dad.

154
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,213
Come on.

155
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,258
Let's go, Miles.

156
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,781
Whew, it's cold.
It shouldn't be so cold.

157
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,867
- There's a draft. You feel it?
- Yeah.

158
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,535
I'll turn the heat on.

159
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,203
Okay.

160
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,707
Want to unpack your bag?

161
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:13,144
Dad?

162
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,105
Are you okay?

163
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,442
Uh, yeah, I just found--

164
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,735
What?

165
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,654
The window was broken.

166
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,031
Go find some cardboard
and some tape.

167
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:27,117
Ask your mother.

168
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,911
Oh... okay.

169
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,510
Dad?

170
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,345
Yeah?

171
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,764
Were you scared before?

172
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:55,562
Maybe I was more shook up than I
thought by that thing on the road.

173
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,275
That's better, right?

174
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,032
Hey, Miles, why don't you
go get the cards?

175
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:09,659
- Dad!
- Get them, we'll have a quick round.

176
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,797
All right.
So...

177
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,510
Pick a card, any card.

178
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,100
Ha! Da-dum-dum-dum.
Da-dum-dum-dum.

179
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:36,019
All right.
''Together.''

180
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:39,022
Hmm. T-o...

181
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,942
g-e-t-h...

182
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:49,240
- I don't know.
- Come on, try.

183
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:52,160
Hmm, e-r?

184
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,746
Good, yeah, good.
Remember, it's basically ''To get her.''

185
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,665
See what I mean?
Let's see what's next.

186
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,170
It's ''Separate.''
This is a tough one.

187
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,255
I can't even spell
this one Every time.

188
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,841
In fact, if you get this,
you'll be top of your class.

189
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,010
You'll rule.
You will rule.

190
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,388
Come on, try.

191
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:14,641
S-e...

192
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,643
- p...
- Uh-huh?

193
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,229
- H mm?
- Where are you going, buddy?

194
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,232
- a-r...?
- Yeah?

195
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:25,360
a-t-e.

196
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:29,114
Good for you.
Nice one. Well done.

197
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:31,282
All right-- Ooh-hoo-hoo.

198
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,243
Toughy, toughy.

199
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:34,661
''Onomatopoeia.''

200
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,497
- I don't think so.
- All right, all right, all right.

201
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,040
''L'chaim.''

202
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:40,959
- Dad!
- All right, all right, all right.

203
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,127
''Appetite, appetite.''

204
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:44,629
- ''Appetite.''
- Come on, Dad. We did two.

205
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,840
Come on, try ''Appetite.''
What's wrong with that?

206
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,050
- You can do that.
- Dad!

207
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,593
All right, all right.
Go on.

208
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,595
You're no fun.

209
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,472
Nice going, kiddo.

210
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,757
What if you're sitting
in your living room

211
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,134
and a bullet
flies through the window?

212
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,470
Who do you call?

213
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,433
I'm just so glad we don't
have Star anymore.

214
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,560
She looked just like a deer.

215
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,854
She wouldn't have lasted
10 seconds out here.

216
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:46,149
- I miss Star.
- There's no TV.

217
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,401
You've got those
cool books there, Miles.

218
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,362
There are videos,
aren't there?

219
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:52,655
Nothing good.

220
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:56,201
Nothing you've heard of.
Let's build a fire.

221
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,202
Cool!

222
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:59,621
Richard said there'd be some wood
in the shed out back.

223
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:00,830
Miles,

224
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,291
- let's go get us some wood.
- Yeah!

225
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:07,087
Come on, bud.

226
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,597
Okay, help me
find some kindling.

227
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,849
Do you know how
to use an ax?

228
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,851
- Huh?
- Mm-hmm.

229
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,688
Okay, first you've got
to get it balanced.

230
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:27,065
Get it right there
in the hole.

231
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,484
Holy moly!

232
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,528
Careful, Miles!

233
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,821
I-yi-yi.

234
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:42,539
They let me use this road
to pass through.

235
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,086
Dad?

236
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,338
- Is that him?
- Shh, shh.

237
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:54,676
He didn't get to keep the deer.

238
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,974
Go to your mom.

239
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,319
So he just drove across?

240
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:14,821
Just drove right by.

241
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,823
I don't understand why Richard
would let anyone

242
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,742
drive across the property.

243
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,452
Maybe Richard,
or maybe Annie,

244
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,454
wanted to seem neighborly
so they let him.

245
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,039
I don't know.

246
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:26,166
I think Annie and Richard
never come up here.

247
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:28,501
That's why they're
so generous with their keys.

248
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,670
It was Annie's thing anyway.

249
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:32,547
I knew Richard's interest
would fade.

250
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,466
He needs to be
in the center of it all.

251
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:37,177
Who wants to retire
to the country when you're young?

252
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,556
It's called an inner life,
George.

253
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,516
Just 'cause you don't approve
of my inner life

254
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,809
doesn't mean
I don't have one.

255
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:45,894
Ooh.

256
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:48,063
Besides, didn't he have
some weird incident up here,

257
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,231
and he just stopped
coming up for a while?

258
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:51,775
I don't remember that.

259
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,488
Maybe he just
told me about it.

260
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,698
What was it?

261
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:00,784
Some incident.
I guess I don't remember.

262
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,661
Probably had to do with that guy
driving across the property.

263
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,872
Annie would've told me
about something like that.

264
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,249
How you doing, Miles?
You liking the pasta?

265
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,293
Mmm, it's okay.

266
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,756
What's the matter?

267
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,925
Nothing.

268
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:19,052
Come on, what is it?

269
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,763
That man knows
where we live.

270
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,599
Miles, don't worry,
sweetie.

271
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,102
I know I got angry
with him

272
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:28,561
outside the car,

273
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:32,774
but he was very excited
because he was chasing that deer.

274
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:36,403
It's really okay to hunt if you're
getting in tune with nature.

275
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,279
Don't feed him
that sack of shit, Kim.

276
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:39,948
- That guy was demented.
- George.

277
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,951
Your father exaggerates,
you know that.

278
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:45,286
It's nothing
to worry about, Miles.

279
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:49,374
Your mom can be very fair
and even-headed,

280
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:50,959
which is cool, right?

281
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:53,128
Except you don't want
to be a softy, either.

282
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:57,090
You got to be wary
of people like that guy.

283
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,509
They can be bad news.

284
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,780
No, queen!
King! King, king!

285
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:22,490
- Okay, okay.
- Jack.

286
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:24,659
Oh, five!

287
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:26,995
Five, six, seven, six--

288
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:28,830
no, no, eight!
Wait, wait, wait.

289
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:31,458
- Nine, five, five, three...
- Jack, Jack.

290
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,127
- Victory!
- No, no. You!

291
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,463
- Dad cheated!
- I did not.

292
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:39,299
- We have to let your father win.
- Hey, hey, hey.

293
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:41,009
Hey, you.
Hey, you.

294
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:54,731
Okay, Miles, come on.

295
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:58,026
- To bed.
- To bed, to bed, to bed.

296
00:21:58,109 --> 00:21:59,527
One more game, please?

297
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,739
- No, come on. Up you go.
- To bed, to bed.

298
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,583
What'd you draw?

299
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,043
Oh, nothing.

300
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,545
Okay.

301
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,858
- Okay?
- Okay.

302
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:40,735
No one there.

303
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,826
No one there?
Okay...

304
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:50,078
And no one there.

305
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:54,708
You're safe.

306
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,338
- Mom?
- Yeah?

307
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:02,590
Do you think that deer
had a little family?

308
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:05,719
Oh, Miles...

309
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:07,721
don't think
about that, sweetie.

310
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:12,726
That's just sad stuff
that happens sometimes.

311
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:15,603
But you know, in nature

312
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:19,566
things like that happen,
and all the animals,

313
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:22,193
they adjust.
There's a balance.

314
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,612
Think about that, okay?

315
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:35,165
- Dad--!
- Dad!

316
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,250
It's not funny.

317
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,712
Good night, kid.

318
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:42,756
Night, Dad.

319
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:51,222
- Leave it open.
- I will, I will.

320
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:54,768
- Leave the hall light on.
- Shh-- go to sleep.

321
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:55,555
Can you tell me a little more
about ''sack of shit''?

322
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:56,765
What?

323
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,392
Talking to Miles
like that at dinner?

324
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:01,853
Oh.

325
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:04,981
- It was a bit harsh, I guess.
- What's the matter, George?

326
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:07,359
I don't know,
I can't put my finger on it.

327
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:10,904
Is it the reshoot?
Are you pissed off you're here?

328
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:13,615
No, no, babe.
That's not it at all.

329
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:16,576
Huh-uh.
This is nice.

330
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:23,249
- What is it?
- I don't know.

331
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:26,628
Yeah...?
Hmm?

332
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:29,589
- Those fucking guys.
- Out on the road?

333
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:32,258
- Yeah.
- What about them?

334
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:34,427
I just felt
the abyss between us--

335
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:37,305
me and that guy
with his shotgun.

336
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:40,725
That wasn't a shotgun,
but anyway...

337
00:26:41,893 --> 00:26:44,646
And he had a pistol.

338
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:48,775
Did that threaten
your manhood?

339
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:51,569
Yeah, I guess it did,
Dr. McLaren.

340
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:54,781
Well, it's very
archetypical

341
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:57,575
for the civilized man

342
00:26:57,701 --> 00:27:00,578
to feel threatened
by the man of the country.

343
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:05,000
That one guy,
he just seemed like--

344
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:07,502
how do you get through
to someone like that?

345
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:09,045
- George.
- Aaah.

346
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,422
- George?
- What?

347
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:13,842
We have ways of restoring
confidence in men with...

348
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:17,053
With emasculation problems?

349
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:19,305
Really?
Perhaps you should show me?

350
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:20,682
Exactly.

351
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:25,061
- Perhaps you could show me, doctor?
- Yeah.

352
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:30,150
Oh, yeah.

353
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,992
- This could take a while.
- Ooh, I hope so.

354
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:42,996
We'd like to start...

355
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,373
with a full checkup.

356
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:46,875
Hey, you.

357
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:53,381
Ho, ho, ho.

358
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:55,300
Wow, is this
to impress your clients?

359
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:58,428
No, my clients aren't
privy to this information.

360
00:27:58,553 --> 00:28:01,097
Oh, really? 'cause I think
this one would cure them all.

361
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:02,182
Shhh.

362
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:07,979
- Is Miles in bed?
- He's fine.

363
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:19,986
Miles?

364
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,905
Are you there?

365
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,032
Mom?

366
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:26,117
I'm s cared.

367
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:28,370
Shh.
It's okay, honey.

368
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:30,372
Dad and I are right here.

369
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:32,332
Try to go back to sleep.

370
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:01,945
Anyway, Stefan's going
to stick to the prenup,

371
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,405
and he's not going
to budge.

372
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:06,324
He's got a right to be pissed.
She slept with his best friend,

373
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:07,992
who happens to be
his accountant too.

374
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:10,495
She's not going to ask for money,
she just wants out.

375
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,914
She's going to take him
for all he's worth.

376
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,959
You're sweet to be naive
on this one, but no.

377
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:17,961
All right,
maybe you're right.

378
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:20,088
It's pretty tacky.

379
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:22,424
If there's any justice,
she'll be hit by a bus.

380
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:25,802
Doesn't work that way,
George.

381
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:28,555
Here we go.

382
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:31,266
Outstanding.

383
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:34,686
Who wants to go into town
with me after breakfast?

384
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:35,979
- I do.
- Me, too.

385
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:38,189
I need curry if I'm
going to make that cass erole.

386
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:39,899
We must have curry.

387
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:41,568
Is very very important.

388
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:44,279
- Must have the curry.
- Dad.

389
00:31:44,362 --> 00:31:45,447
I like the curry.

390
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:48,033
I cook the meanest curry
this side of Delhi.

391
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,924
Gotcha!

392
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:11,473
One,

393
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:12,891
two!

394
00:32:25,236 --> 00:32:27,864
Think that guy
really pees in the reservoir?

395
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:29,657
Shush, George.

396
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:33,161
You're going to get Miles
all excited talking about pee pee.

397
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:05,819
We're going to go in this store,
you want to come?

398
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:08,988
No, I'm going to go
get the milk and curry.

399
00:33:09,072 --> 00:33:10,949
What'd you say,
olive oil?

400
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:12,951
Something for Miles
to drink, too.

401
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:14,869
What should I get him?

402
00:33:14,953 --> 00:33:17,497
Something he'd like,
George.

403
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,374
Okay, okay.
Cool it, baby.

404
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:21,668
Fruit juice or something.

405
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:23,461
All right.
I'll pull the car around.

406
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:25,130
- I'll meet you right here.
- Okay.

407
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:24,791
You like that?

408
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:28,211
It's okay,
you can talk to me.

409
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:30,213
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you know what it is?

410
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:35,135
Wendigo.

411
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:39,097
- Wendigo?
- Wendigo.

412
00:35:39,222 --> 00:35:42,767
- What's a Wendigo?
- A Wendigo is a mighty,

413
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:44,853
powerful spirit.

414
00:35:44,936 --> 00:35:47,480
What's it look like?

415
00:35:47,605 --> 00:35:50,066
It can take on
many forms.

416
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:52,736
Part wind, part tree,

417
00:35:52,861 --> 00:35:54,446
part man,

418
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:56,281
part beast.

419
00:35:56,406 --> 00:35:58,658
Shapeshifting between them.

420
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:01,161
Shapeshifting?

421
00:36:01,244 --> 00:36:04,039
Shapeshifting.

422
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:06,166
Can it fly?

423
00:36:06,249 --> 00:36:10,128
It can fly at you like
a sudden storm, without warning,

424
00:36:10,253 --> 00:36:12,213
from nowhere...

425
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:13,965
and de vour you--

426
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:18,887
consume you with its
ferocious appetite.

427
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,722
Appetite?

428
00:36:20,847 --> 00:36:23,850
The Wendigo is hungry--
always hungry.

429
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:26,770
And its hunger
is never satisfied.

430
00:36:26,895 --> 00:36:29,689
The more it eats,
the bigger it gets.

431
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:32,192
And the bigger it gets,

432
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:34,277
the hungrier it gets.

433
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:38,114
And we are hopeless
in the face of it.

434
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:40,116
We are devoured.

435
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:43,078
Is the Wendigo bad?

436
00:36:43,161 --> 00:36:46,206
Nothing between
the earth and sky is bad.

437
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:48,458
But there are spirits

438
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:50,168
that should be feared.

439
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:52,087
'Cause why?

440
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,756
Because there are spirits

441
00:36:54,881 --> 00:36:56,925
that are angry.

442
00:36:58,468 --> 00:37:00,303
Angry?

443
00:37:00,428 --> 00:37:02,681
Do you believe me?

444
00:37:02,806 --> 00:37:04,766
I guess.

445
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:06,768
Go ahead and take it.

446
00:37:06,851 --> 00:37:09,688
Nobody believes
in spirits anymore.

447
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:13,066
Doesn't mean
they're not there.

448
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:17,070
He who hears
the cry of the Wendigo

449
00:37:17,153 --> 00:37:20,323
is never the same again.

450
00:37:20,448 --> 00:37:21,574
Miles?

451
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:24,452
Miles, let's go.

452
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:25,787
Come on.

453
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:30,083
Whoa, whoa.
You've got to be careful in here.

454
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:31,751
What have you got?

455
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:34,504
The man gave it to me.

456
00:37:34,629 --> 00:37:36,297
What man?

457
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:39,050
Behind the counter back there.

458
00:37:39,175 --> 00:37:40,552
Excuse me.

459
00:37:40,677 --> 00:37:43,722
My son said the man up there
gave him this little figure.

460
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:46,057
- Is that okay?
- What's he got?

461
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:50,103
That's... $5.

462
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:53,273
$5? Come on, Miles,
who said you could have that?

463
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:56,860
The Indian guy
behind the counter back there.

464
00:37:56,985 --> 00:38:00,530
Is that possible
someone gave it to him?

465
00:38:00,655 --> 00:38:02,240
Nobody works here but me.

466
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:03,825
Nobody's been in here
but me.

467
00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:07,495
Oh, okay.
Come on, Miles.

468
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,247
Let's give it back.

469
00:38:10,707 --> 00:38:14,169
He's kind of cool.
Will you take $3?

470
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:15,920
Four.

471
00:38:16,046 --> 00:38:18,298
Okay.

472
00:38:18,381 --> 00:38:20,050
You just blew
our budget, Miles.

473
00:38:22,552 --> 00:38:24,387
There was a guy, mom.

474
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:27,140
- He gave it to me.
- What kind of a guy?

475
00:38:27,223 --> 00:38:28,933
Hey, Dad.

476
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:30,935
- What?
- Later.

477
00:38:32,062 --> 00:38:33,605
Come on.

478
00:39:09,474 --> 00:39:11,726
- Mom?
- Yeah?

479
00:39:11,851 --> 00:39:13,853
Didn't you see
the man?

480
00:39:13,978 --> 00:39:17,232
I didn't see him.
Doesn't mean he wasn't there,

481
00:39:17,315 --> 00:39:20,527
but you shouldn't
make stuff up that isn't true.

482
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:22,320
He was there.

483
00:39:22,445 --> 00:39:24,823
I believe you, sweetie.

484
00:39:24,948 --> 00:39:26,616
If it's true.

485
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:28,201
Mom.

486
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,597
Wendigo.

487
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:57,272
It can grow as tall
as the trees

488
00:39:57,397 --> 00:40:00,608
and still it aches
with hunger.

489
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:15,623
The Wendigo is hungry--

490
00:40:15,707 --> 00:40:17,250
always hungry.

491
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:20,420
And it's hunger
is never satisfied.

492
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:25,300
The more it eats,
the bigger it gets.

493
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:29,888
And the bigger it gets,
the hungrier it gets.

494
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:32,891
And we are hopeless

495
00:40:33,016 --> 00:40:35,185
in the face of it.

496
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,520
We are devoured.

497
00:40:39,147 --> 00:40:43,401
It can fly at you like a sudden storm,
without warning,

498
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:44,986
from nowhere...

499
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:46,071
and devour you--

500
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:48,114
consume you

501
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:50,492
with its ferocious appetite.

502
00:40:55,205 --> 00:40:58,750
There are spirits
that should be feared...

503
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:02,128
because there are spirits

504
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:04,339
that are angry.

505
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:10,762
- Jesus.
- What?

506
00:41:10,887 --> 00:41:12,722
I can't take this guy.

507
00:41:12,847 --> 00:41:15,642
Seriously, he's like Boo Radley
the way he's always around.

508
00:41:15,725 --> 00:41:18,019
George, Boo Radley
was a good guy.

509
00:41:18,144 --> 00:41:19,854
Right, Miles?

510
00:41:22,023 --> 00:41:24,359
Did you realize how close
we are to those guys?

511
00:41:24,442 --> 00:41:26,444
Those are some
nice neighbors to have.

512
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,029
George, shush.

513
00:41:36,621 --> 00:41:37,872
Look, Dad.

514
00:41:37,914 --> 00:41:40,333
Look what I got from the man
at the thrift store.

515
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:41,793
- It's magic.
- That's cool.

516
00:41:41,918 --> 00:41:44,254
Why don't you go show that guy
to your transformers?

517
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:46,423
They're not transformers.

518
00:41:52,095 --> 00:41:53,972
What? What?

519
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:56,057
You got to show
more interest.

520
00:41:56,182 --> 00:41:59,310
Last week it was transformers.
What can I say?

521
00:41:59,394 --> 00:42:02,147
You don't see it, George,

522
00:42:02,272 --> 00:42:04,524
but he lies and makes stuff up
to get attention.

523
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:07,360
It's because you got
to be there for him.

524
00:42:07,444 --> 00:42:10,030
If we're going to do these weekends,
you got to be engaged.

525
00:42:10,113 --> 00:42:13,199
You put these ideas in his head that
I'm not interested. It's not fair.

526
00:42:13,324 --> 00:42:15,368
Come on, I don't
discuss this with Miles.

527
00:42:15,493 --> 00:42:17,912
You've got all this anger
you carry around from work

528
00:42:17,996 --> 00:42:19,914
or I don't know where,
and he feels it.

529
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,167
- He thinks it's directed at him.
- Oh--

530
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:24,085
He doesn't know what it is,
I don't know.

531
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:26,087
- Everyone's got anger.
- Oh, George.

532
00:42:26,171 --> 00:42:27,964
I don't want to be
analyzed right now.

533
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:32,260
Miles sees this stuff.
He sees.

534
00:42:33,678 --> 00:42:36,431
I got to make this phone call
to Charles in the city.

535
00:42:36,514 --> 00:42:38,308
I told him I'd call.

536
00:42:38,433 --> 00:42:41,019
I'll take Miles out afterwards.
We'll go sledding.

537
00:42:42,687 --> 00:42:44,189
Okay.

538
00:42:45,565 --> 00:42:47,233
I'll cook.

539
00:42:47,317 --> 00:42:49,152
I got the curry.

540
00:42:49,277 --> 00:42:51,071
Thank you, dear.

541
00:42:52,614 --> 00:42:53,990
Come on, baby.
Hey, hey, hey.

542
00:42:54,115 --> 00:42:56,826
We never even looked around
the whole house together.

543
00:42:56,951 --> 00:42:59,162
No, go ahead.
Go on, make your call.

544
00:42:59,287 --> 00:43:01,331
No, no, no.
Let's look upstairs. Come on.

545
00:43:16,012 --> 00:43:17,931
I guess they're
still fixing it up.

546
00:43:20,058 --> 00:43:24,104
I'd love to have the time
to acquire all this stuff.

547
00:43:24,187 --> 00:43:25,480
Yup.

548
00:43:25,563 --> 00:43:27,982
Annie has a good eye.

549
00:43:28,066 --> 00:43:29,275
Mmm.

550
00:43:30,527 --> 00:43:31,986
Aaah!

551
00:43:33,238 --> 00:43:36,491
She really has this whole
stag thing going here.

552
00:43:36,616 --> 00:43:38,201
I mean, look at this.

553
00:43:38,326 --> 00:43:39,786
Aah.

554
00:43:39,911 --> 00:43:40,954
Poor deer.

555
00:43:41,037 --> 00:43:43,707
I took this funny picture
of the sheriff in town today.

556
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:45,583
Yeah?

557
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:47,585
He shot me this look.

558
00:43:47,669 --> 00:43:49,087
It must piss
the locals off,

559
00:43:49,212 --> 00:43:50,755
all these outsiders
coming up here.

560
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:52,716
It's really great
you brought your camera.

561
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:54,509
Get some pictures
for yourself.

562
00:43:54,634 --> 00:43:56,678
- Yeah. Hey, look at this.
- What?

563
00:43:56,803 --> 00:43:59,180
- You know that reservoir?
- Yeah.

564
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:02,058
This whole town's
buried under there.

565
00:44:02,183 --> 00:44:04,561
- Hmm.
- 10,000 acres.

566
00:44:04,686 --> 00:44:06,354
They flooded the valley
in 1907

567
00:44:06,479 --> 00:44:08,648
to make drinking water
for New York City.

568
00:44:08,732 --> 00:44:11,735
- Wow.
- That's a lot of displaced people.

569
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,362
We'd already displaced
the Indians.

570
00:44:14,487 --> 00:44:16,197
Now Annie and Richard
live here.

571
00:44:16,281 --> 00:44:17,949
Displacing Everybody.

572
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,204
A lot of Indian stuff
in the area.

573
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:26,332
Yeah, it's
the Catskills, George.

574
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:28,626
''Yeah, it's the Catskills, George.''

575
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:30,211
''It's the Catskills.''

576
00:44:51,149 --> 00:44:52,567
Miles: No!

577
00:44:56,696 --> 00:44:58,573
Miles?

578
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:01,576
Miles?

579
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:09,084
Miles?

580
00:45:31,106 --> 00:45:33,108
Miles?

581
00:45:35,026 --> 00:45:36,778
Are you okay, sweetie?

582
00:45:36,903 --> 00:45:39,447
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

583
00:45:39,572 --> 00:45:41,116
What's the matter?

584
00:45:43,034 --> 00:45:45,578
Nothing.
I just got sad.

585
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:48,581
- Are you cold out here?
- I'm okay.

586
00:45:51,501 --> 00:45:53,253
What made you sad?

587
00:45:54,379 --> 00:45:57,173
- I don't know.
- What do you think it is?

588
00:45:57,298 --> 00:45:58,842
You can tell mommy.

589
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:01,928
Maybe he's just moody
like his dad, right, tiger?

590
00:46:02,053 --> 00:46:05,557
Sometimes it helps to talk
about things when you're sad.

591
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,060
You've got to watch for those moods.
They'll get the best of you.

592
00:46:09,144 --> 00:46:11,730
You'll end up taking soulful
pictures of corporate logos.

593
00:46:11,813 --> 00:46:13,356
Oh, you shush.
Don't listen to him.

594
00:46:13,481 --> 00:46:15,233
Your father complains
about his work,

595
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:17,360
but a lot of people
would kill for his job.

596
00:46:17,485 --> 00:46:18,945
Don't listen to her.

597
00:46:19,029 --> 00:46:21,489
Feeling sorry for yourself
is very unattractive.

598
00:46:21,573 --> 00:46:23,950
Miles, remember,
boys against girls.

599
00:46:24,034 --> 00:46:26,536
Hey.
Hey, tiger.

600
00:46:28,163 --> 00:46:30,373
I think your dad wants
to take you sledding.

601
00:46:30,498 --> 00:46:32,959
- Right, Dad?
- Yeah! What do you say?

602
00:46:33,043 --> 00:46:34,669
Um, okay.

603
00:46:36,129 --> 00:46:38,673
All right, I'm going to make
this call and we'll go out.

604
00:46:38,798 --> 00:46:40,300
So you get ready.
I'll be right back.

605
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,843
- Yeah, man?
- Yeah.

606
00:46:41,926 --> 00:46:43,345
Yeah, man.

607
00:46:47,182 --> 00:46:49,059
You okay, sweetie?

608
00:46:49,184 --> 00:46:52,854
- Don't worry, mom.
- '' Don't worry, mom''?

609
00:46:52,979 --> 00:46:55,357
You're growing up
so fast.

610
00:46:55,482 --> 00:46:57,400
Now come here.

611
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:02,489
Hey, Chas,
it's George.

612
00:47:02,614 --> 00:47:05,742
So what's the verdict?
Are they serious about this reshoot?

613
00:47:07,535 --> 00:47:09,287
Really? Fuck!

614
00:47:09,371 --> 00:47:11,331
I'm up here, so...

615
00:47:14,959 --> 00:47:17,212
It's nice.
Yeah, it's pretty cold.

616
00:47:17,337 --> 00:47:19,422
Well, we had this--

617
00:47:19,547 --> 00:47:21,383
this weird thing happen.

618
00:47:21,466 --> 00:47:24,386
Yeah, we hit this deer.

619
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:27,806
It came right at the windshield,
so that was bad enough,

620
00:47:27,889 --> 00:47:30,183
but then there was
this one guy, man.

621
00:47:30,266 --> 00:47:32,394
I'm telling you, Chas,
this guy was bad news.

622
00:47:34,312 --> 00:47:35,730
It scared me, yeah.

623
00:47:35,855 --> 00:47:37,691
I was afraid
for Kim and the kid.

624
00:47:40,026 --> 00:47:42,487
So what do they say
the problem is?

625
00:47:42,612 --> 00:47:44,572
It's too dark?

626
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:49,744
In terms of light or tone--
like content, know what I mean?

627
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,873
Do they know what they mean?

628
00:47:56,626 --> 00:47:58,878
Maybe it's just
a question of contrast.

629
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:02,465
No, I mean visual contrast.

630
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:04,426
I could bring out
the highlights.

631
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:10,015
Anyway, I'm not fighting
for anything anymore.

632
00:48:10,098 --> 00:48:12,017
Just tell them to tell us
what they want,

633
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,353
I'll deal with it on Tuesday.
I'm taking Monday off like I planned.

634
00:48:15,437 --> 00:48:17,522
They don't own me.

635
00:48:17,647 --> 00:48:20,900
Okay, they don't
own me till Tuesday, okay?

636
00:48:22,777 --> 00:48:24,696
All right, Chas.
Thanks, man.

637
00:48:24,779 --> 00:48:26,156
Okay, I'll see you.

638
00:48:26,281 --> 00:48:27,699
Hey, hey.

639
00:48:27,782 --> 00:48:30,243
I'm going
to take Miles out.

640
00:48:30,326 --> 00:48:32,078
We're going sledding.

641
00:48:34,748 --> 00:48:36,332
You better believe it.

642
00:48:43,006 --> 00:48:45,884
Hey, Miles, help!
Aaah!

643
00:48:45,967 --> 00:48:47,719
Dad.

644
00:48:47,802 --> 00:48:48,928
I know.
Ha ha ha.

645
00:48:52,432 --> 00:48:54,142
Aaah!

646
00:48:54,267 --> 00:48:55,977
No, aah!

647
00:49:02,984 --> 00:49:04,736
Come on, kiddo.
Are you ready?

648
00:49:04,819 --> 00:49:07,739
So, what happened?

649
00:49:07,822 --> 00:49:09,824
They want to do it,
fuck them.

650
00:49:09,908 --> 00:49:12,535
What are you going to do?
You need to go back?

651
00:49:13,661 --> 00:49:15,538
No, baby, I want
to do this for us.

652
00:49:15,663 --> 00:49:18,958
Charles can
take care of it.

653
00:49:19,042 --> 00:49:21,002
We could go back
early Monday.

654
00:49:21,127 --> 00:49:24,589
It's beautiful, it's perfect.
Come on, kiddo, let's go.

655
00:49:40,021 --> 00:49:41,940
Ha ha ha!

656
00:49:42,023 --> 00:49:44,025
We're off, we're off,
we're off!

657
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:47,654
Here you go, buddy.
Take my hand.

658
00:49:47,737 --> 00:49:49,823
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah!

659
00:49:49,948 --> 00:49:51,366
Sledding, sledding,
sledding.

660
00:49:51,491 --> 00:49:53,827
You guys be careful.

661
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:56,788
- Oh, Mom.
- Oh, Mom.

662
00:50:17,434 --> 00:50:19,436
Andy? Hi.

663
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:22,439
It's Dr. McLaren.
Is Everything all right?

664
00:50:22,564 --> 00:50:24,858
I thought we weren't going
to call on the weekends?

665
00:50:26,192 --> 00:50:29,070
Okay, okay.
What happened?

666
00:50:30,363 --> 00:50:32,365
Okay.

667
00:50:32,449 --> 00:50:34,200
How do you feel
about that?

668
00:50:34,284 --> 00:50:36,911
Right.

669
00:50:38,329 --> 00:50:40,999
You were intimidated, but...

670
00:50:41,082 --> 00:50:44,419
What did you tell him?

671
00:51:01,102 --> 00:51:03,271
Sorry, Andy,

672
00:51:03,396 --> 00:51:06,775
but that's good.

673
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:10,612
It's right, because
you don't have the money.

674
00:51:10,695 --> 00:51:14,240
So-- wait a minute, Andy,
I think they have call waiting here.

675
00:51:14,324 --> 00:51:15,617
Hello?

676
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:19,120
Hey, Richard,
thanks for getting back to us.

677
00:51:19,245 --> 00:51:20,747
Listen--

678
00:51:20,872 --> 00:51:23,583
Oh, yeah?
You getting a tan down there?

679
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:26,294
Listen, we called because--

680
00:51:26,419 --> 00:51:27,379
Shit.

681
00:51:27,462 --> 00:51:29,798
I'm sorry,
can you wait a minute?

682
00:51:29,881 --> 00:51:31,424
I have someone
on the other line.

683
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:33,218
Hold on.

684
00:51:33,301 --> 00:51:36,054
Andy? Hi.
I have to take this.

685
00:51:36,137 --> 00:51:38,640
But listen-- you did well.

686
00:51:38,765 --> 00:51:41,935
You asserted yourself.
Try to experience that on your own.

687
00:51:42,018 --> 00:51:44,771
After you've thought about it,
we'll talk on Wednesday.

688
00:51:44,854 --> 00:51:48,149
Okay? It's important to keep
some boundaries between us.

689
00:51:48,233 --> 00:51:50,777
You're trying to get
to be more independent, right?

690
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:52,362
Andy?

691
00:51:52,487 --> 00:51:54,572
Okay, bye bye.

692
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:58,284
Richard.
Richard, are you there?

693
00:51:58,368 --> 00:52:00,829
Hello?
Hel--

694
00:52:00,912 --> 00:52:02,622
Shit.

695
00:52:18,722 --> 00:52:21,016
''Whose woods these are
I think I know.

696
00:52:21,099 --> 00:52:23,601
His house is in
the village though;

697
00:52:23,685 --> 00:52:26,021
He will not see me
stopping here

698
00:52:26,104 --> 00:52:28,064
To watch his woods
fill up with snow...

699
00:52:28,189 --> 00:52:31,276
The woods are lovely,
dark and deep.

700
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,862
But I have promises
to keep,

701
00:52:33,945 --> 00:52:36,573
And miles to go
before I sleep,

702
00:52:36,698 --> 00:52:39,492
And miles to go
before I sleep.''

703
00:52:39,576 --> 00:52:41,077
- Miles!
- That's right.

704
00:52:41,202 --> 00:52:43,329
The poet's name
was Robert Frost.

705
00:52:43,455 --> 00:52:45,373
He was writing
about the cold.

706
00:52:45,498 --> 00:52:48,126
- What do you think about that?
- Oh, Dad.

707
00:52:48,209 --> 00:52:52,005
Now Frost could take a simple image
and make it seem deep.

708
00:52:52,088 --> 00:52:54,007
That's his rap.

709
00:53:10,065 --> 00:53:11,983
Hey, what's the matter?

710
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:14,361
- Dad?
- Yeah?

711
00:53:14,444 --> 00:53:17,155
- What's a Wendigo?
- A Wendigo?

712
00:53:17,238 --> 00:53:20,075
I don't know. I never heard of that.
What's a Wendigo?

713
00:53:20,158 --> 00:53:21,659
I don't know.

714
00:53:21,743 --> 00:53:23,244
Where'd you hear
about it?

715
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:26,539
- This man.
- What man?

716
00:53:26,623 --> 00:53:29,542
- In the thrift store.
- In town?

717
00:53:29,626 --> 00:53:32,587
He told me the Wendigo
is this man

718
00:53:32,712 --> 00:53:36,216
who's part animal,
always hungry,

719
00:53:36,299 --> 00:53:38,885
and he eats people.

720
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:42,597
The Wendigo only goes
after bad guys, Miles.

721
00:53:42,722 --> 00:53:45,642
You're safe.
You're a good kid.

722
00:53:48,061 --> 00:53:50,647
- Hey, Miles?
- Yeah?

723
00:53:50,772 --> 00:53:52,857
A lot of people
make up stories

724
00:53:52,941 --> 00:53:55,318
to make sense
of the world.

725
00:53:55,443 --> 00:53:57,862
It's a big world
after all,

726
00:53:57,946 --> 00:54:01,616
and nobody really understands
how it all works.

727
00:54:01,741 --> 00:54:05,578
Maybe for that guy
it's comforting to think

728
00:54:05,662 --> 00:54:08,373
that the Wendigo is responsible

729
00:54:08,456 --> 00:54:10,250
for all the bad stuff
out there.

730
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:12,919
That's okay.
That's what myths are.

731
00:54:13,044 --> 00:54:15,422
They help us
talk about stuff.

732
00:54:15,505 --> 00:54:19,050
Like Mr. Freeze
and Dr. Evil.

733
00:54:19,134 --> 00:54:20,844
Dr. Evil.

734
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:23,555
There are good myths guys too,
like Superman and Yoda.

735
00:54:23,638 --> 00:54:25,724
- Hmm.
- It's important to know

736
00:54:25,807 --> 00:54:28,309
that they're just myths,
just stories.

737
00:54:28,435 --> 00:54:30,520
You'll end up being
very disappointed

738
00:54:30,645 --> 00:54:32,772
when things don't come true
that you're wishing.

739
00:54:32,856 --> 00:54:36,443
Like when you didn't get
your big show in Soho?

740
00:54:36,526 --> 00:54:39,487
Soho?
You little monster.

741
00:54:39,571 --> 00:54:41,322
You are a dead man.

742
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:43,867
Oh, Dad.

743
00:54:43,992 --> 00:54:45,577
You--
I've had enough of you.

744
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:48,788
You little--
you're a dead man.

745
00:54:48,913 --> 00:54:50,165
- No!
- You're a dead man.

746
00:54:53,043 --> 00:54:54,794
Truce! Truce.

747
00:54:56,921 --> 00:54:58,923
Truce!

748
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:00,925
Truce?
Truce?

749
00:55:01,009 --> 00:55:02,510
Yeah.

750
00:55:04,971 --> 00:55:07,307
- Okay.
- Dad.

751
00:55:15,774 --> 00:55:17,317
Come here, buddy.

752
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,028
Hey.
Come on, let's sit.

753
00:55:21,696 --> 00:55:24,491
It's good you feel bad about
that deer we hit, you know?

754
00:55:25,617 --> 00:55:28,036
But things like that happen.

755
00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:30,914
And you have to go through
a period of mourning.

756
00:55:32,332 --> 00:55:36,628
Like where you're sad,
and then you put it behind you.$(where czy when)

757
00:55:36,711 --> 00:55:38,421
You get it?

758
00:55:38,546 --> 00:55:40,465
Where even
the worst thing

759
00:55:40,548 --> 00:55:42,967
can be seen
in another way.

760
00:55:44,469 --> 00:55:47,472
'Cause you got to be flexible
to make it in this old world.

761
00:55:47,555 --> 00:55:49,182
Hmmm.

762
00:55:49,307 --> 00:55:52,894
You sure you're not just stalling
'cause that hill looks steep?

763
00:55:53,019 --> 00:55:55,271
No way!

764
00:55:55,397 --> 00:55:57,065
Okay, buddy,
let's get that ride

765
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:59,067
so we can go home
and bother your mother.

766
00:55:59,192 --> 00:56:00,568
Yeah!

767
00:56:00,694 --> 00:56:01,945
Come on, buddy!

768
00:56:45,947 --> 00:56:47,949
Dad?

769
00:57:31,409 --> 00:57:32,869
Dad?

770
00:57:33,995 --> 00:57:35,663
Dad?

771
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:40,168
Dad?

772
00:58:39,853 --> 00:58:42,355
Miles?

773
00:58:42,439 --> 00:58:44,357
Miles?

774
00:58:44,441 --> 00:58:46,234
Can you hear me?

775
00:58:46,317 --> 00:58:48,695
Miles?

776
00:58:48,778 --> 00:58:50,363
Miles?

777
00:58:50,488 --> 00:58:52,282
Are you okay?

778
00:58:52,407 --> 00:58:54,242
Can you hear me?

779
00:58:54,325 --> 00:58:57,454
Can you get up,
sweetie?

780
00:58:57,579 --> 00:59:01,666
Here.
Careful, careful.

781
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:03,251
Honey,
you hit your head.

782
00:59:04,419 --> 00:59:07,005
You're okay.
You're okay?

783
00:59:07,088 --> 00:59:09,007
Huh?
Where's your father?

784
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:11,051
Where? Huh?

785
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:14,262
Where?

786
00:59:20,518 --> 00:59:22,937
I don't understand,
Miles.

787
00:59:23,063 --> 00:59:25,148
What happened?

788
00:59:26,566 --> 00:59:30,528
- Daddy fell off the sled.
- How did he fall off the sled?

789
00:59:30,612 --> 00:59:32,739
I don't know.

790
00:59:32,864 --> 00:59:35,617
Hold my hand tight.

791
00:59:38,244 --> 00:59:40,163
- Oh my God.
- He was here, mom.

792
00:59:40,288 --> 00:59:42,665
He was here.
He wouldn't move.

793
00:59:42,791 --> 00:59:43,917
Oh, God.

794
00:59:53,176 --> 00:59:55,387
It's okay.
It's okay.

795
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:57,389
It's okay.

796
00:59:59,265 --> 01:00:01,768
Come on.
Come on.

797
01:00:01,851 --> 01:00:03,478
Come on.

798
01:00:04,604 --> 01:00:06,231
Oh, God.

799
01:00:09,484 --> 01:00:11,486
Hold on.

800
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,045
Oh, my God.

801
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:31,673
Miles...

802
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:34,759
did you hear anything when dad
fell off the sled?

803
01:00:34,843 --> 01:00:37,929
- I don't remember.
- It's okay, sweetie.

804
01:00:38,013 --> 01:00:40,682
Come on,
hold my hand tight.

805
01:00:40,807 --> 01:00:42,809
Come on-- wait, wait.

806
01:00:54,446 --> 01:00:56,698
We've got a whole deer
to cut up!

807
01:00:56,823 --> 01:00:59,534
Where are you going?

808
01:01:52,587 --> 01:01:54,673
- Hey!
- Oh.

809
01:01:56,841 --> 01:01:59,219
Can I help you
with something?

810
01:01:59,302 --> 01:02:02,222
I'm-- I'm trying
to find my husband.

811
01:02:02,222 --> 01:02:04,683
Husband?!

812
01:02:04,766 --> 01:02:07,811
- There's been an accident.
- What kind of accident?

813
01:02:07,936 --> 01:02:10,563
- Have you seen my husband?
- What's he look like?

814
01:02:10,647 --> 01:02:13,191
What was the name
of the guy who left?

815
01:02:13,274 --> 01:02:15,777
He pulled out in his truck
just before I got here?

816
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:17,112
Otis?

817
01:02:17,237 --> 01:02:19,114
Brandon, put those
on the bench.

818
01:02:19,197 --> 01:02:21,658
It was you that was out
in the road last night, right?

819
01:02:21,783 --> 01:02:23,952
You're staying at
the Stooky place this weekend?

820
01:02:24,077 --> 01:02:27,414
Anyway, I'm sorry.
I saw a light on,

821
01:02:27,497 --> 01:02:29,290
I-I needed to check.

822
01:02:29,374 --> 01:02:30,875
- Come on, Miles.
- Just a minute.

823
01:02:30,959 --> 01:02:32,502
Did you have some kind of accident?

824
01:02:32,627 --> 01:02:34,713
- You want a tow or something?
- What happened?

825
01:02:34,796 --> 01:02:36,047
No, I-I'm--

826
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:38,258
I'm sorry,
I-I was wrong. I--

827
01:02:38,341 --> 01:02:41,094
I-I'm sorry.
I have to run.

828
01:02:41,177 --> 01:02:44,055
Come on, sweetie, come on.
Hold on.

829
01:02:44,139 --> 01:02:45,890
- Jesus Christ.
- Just let her go.

830
01:02:45,974 --> 01:02:49,102
- Dad, where do you want these?
- Put them in the freezer.

831
01:02:50,353 --> 01:02:52,814
- Spooky, man.
- Yeah.

832
01:02:52,939 --> 01:02:56,026
- What was that about?
- They're just excitable city people.

833
01:02:56,151 --> 01:02:58,611
Hey, man, what'd you do
with the beer?

834
01:02:58,737 --> 01:03:02,824
We drank
all the last stuff I bought.

835
01:03:02,949 --> 01:03:05,785
- What do you want to do with these?
- Put them in the freezer.

836
01:03:05,869 --> 01:03:07,704
Unless you want
to eat them tonight.

837
01:03:22,677 --> 01:03:24,721
Okay, Miles,

838
01:03:24,846 --> 01:03:27,849
sweetie, you're gonna
have to walk.

839
01:03:29,351 --> 01:03:32,062
Daddy's probably
gone home.

840
01:03:35,857 --> 01:03:38,193
George!

841
01:03:41,613 --> 01:03:43,531
George!

842
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,873
Oh, my God!

843
01:03:51,998 --> 01:03:54,376
Miles,
he did go home!

844
01:03:54,459 --> 01:03:56,336
Come on. George!

845
01:04:00,674 --> 01:04:02,258
George!

846
01:04:02,384 --> 01:04:05,053
- George!
- Dad!

847
01:04:05,178 --> 01:04:07,055
George.
Oh, my God.

848
01:04:13,269 --> 01:04:15,563
Kim-- Kim.

849
01:04:15,647 --> 01:04:18,108
What--

850
01:04:18,233 --> 01:04:21,194
Oh, my God!
Miles, get a blanket.

851
01:04:21,277 --> 01:04:24,280
Daddy's going to be all right.
We just want to keep him warm.

852
01:04:24,406 --> 01:04:25,990
And a scotch--
Aargh!

853
01:04:26,074 --> 01:04:28,576
- What happened?
- This is bad.

854
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:31,121
Who would believe it--
I'd swear I've been shot.

855
01:04:31,246 --> 01:04:33,748
Those fucking guys!

856
01:04:33,873 --> 01:04:36,376
- They shot me!
- Can we get you inside?

857
01:04:36,501 --> 01:04:39,045
No, baby, no, no, no.
We've got to get to Danbury.

858
01:04:39,129 --> 01:04:41,589
There's a hospital there.
We-- just get in the car.

859
01:04:41,673 --> 01:04:43,758
- I'll call an ambulance.
- No, baby, no, no, no.

860
01:04:43,883 --> 01:04:45,468
I got to know
we're on our way.

861
01:04:45,593 --> 01:04:47,429
George, are you sure?
I don't know.

862
01:04:47,512 --> 01:04:49,431
Let's do it!
Let's do it, Kimmy!

863
01:04:49,514 --> 01:04:51,433
Oh God, oh!

864
01:04:52,934 --> 01:04:55,395
Kim!

865
01:05:38,438 --> 01:05:40,607
Miles!

866
01:05:42,734 --> 01:05:44,569
Miles, help me!

867
01:05:46,905 --> 01:05:48,865
Okay, push me,
push my back.

868
01:05:50,283 --> 01:05:52,619
- Let me do it, let me do it!
- Can you get up?

869
01:05:52,702 --> 01:05:54,871
- Let me do it!
- Okay. Okay.

870
01:05:57,374 --> 01:06:00,418
Oh God, George...
Oh God.

871
01:06:00,502 --> 01:06:02,629
Hand me the blanket,
sweetie.

872
01:06:02,754 --> 01:06:05,465
Okay... Let's go,
let's go.

873
01:06:05,548 --> 01:06:08,343
Hey, you okay?

874
01:06:08,426 --> 01:06:10,261
- You okay, Miles?
- Yeah, Dad.

875
01:06:10,345 --> 01:06:12,305
Yeah, you see me
fall off that sled?

876
01:06:12,389 --> 01:06:14,349
- Yeah.
- How about that, huh?

877
01:06:14,432 --> 01:06:16,685
I ran into a tree
looking for you.

878
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:18,603
Aww, good for you.
Atta boy.

879
01:06:18,687 --> 01:06:20,271
Shh, shh,
stop talking.

880
01:06:20,355 --> 01:06:21,898
Get the door.

881
01:06:22,023 --> 01:06:24,651
It can fly at you
like a sudden storm,

882
01:06:24,776 --> 01:06:27,987
without warning,
from nowhere...

883
01:06:28,071 --> 01:06:30,407
and devour you--

884
01:06:30,532 --> 01:06:33,993
consume you with
his ferocious appetite.

885
01:06:35,078 --> 01:06:38,748
The Wendigo is hungry,
always hungry.

886
01:06:38,873 --> 01:06:42,335
Its hunger
is never satisfied.

887
01:06:43,586 --> 01:06:45,588
Do you want this?

888
01:06:47,132 --> 01:06:49,300
I don't believe it.

889
01:06:53,888 --> 01:06:56,224
Miles, seatbelt.

890
01:06:58,184 --> 01:07:00,270
I fell back off the sled.

891
01:07:00,395 --> 01:07:02,605
I didn't know what had happened
for the longest time.

892
01:07:02,731 --> 01:07:04,232
I couldn't even feel the pain.

893
01:07:04,357 --> 01:07:06,109
I didn't know if it was
hot or cold.

894
01:07:06,234 --> 01:07:08,570
But then I saw the blood,
I must have fainted.

895
01:07:08,695 --> 01:07:11,197
When I woke up,
it was like I'd been drowning

896
01:07:11,281 --> 01:07:13,241
and this was
my last breath of air.

897
01:07:13,324 --> 01:07:15,785
Like if I didn't
take this breath, I'd--

898
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:18,038
I'd slip away
for good...

899
01:07:18,121 --> 01:07:20,540
into some euphoria.

900
01:07:20,623 --> 01:07:23,585
I was tempted,
but I made myself get up.

901
01:07:23,668 --> 01:07:26,504
I found the house,
it was easy.

902
01:07:26,588 --> 01:07:30,050
It was like I was
carried by a big wind

903
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:32,218
and dropped at the door.

904
01:07:34,304 --> 01:07:36,639
This is it,
I can feel it.

905
01:07:36,765 --> 01:07:39,809
I'm only half here, Kim.

906
01:07:39,934 --> 01:07:42,771
Daddy's gonna be all right, Miles.

907
01:07:42,854 --> 01:07:45,065
Daddy's gonna
be all right.

908
01:07:46,441 --> 01:07:48,485
This is an emergency.
My husband...

909
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:49,986
has been shot.

910
01:07:50,111 --> 01:07:52,822
I need to know where
the hospital is in Danbury.

911
01:07:52,947 --> 01:07:53,990
Fuck.

912
01:07:54,115 --> 01:07:57,410
I'm heading west
on Route 19.

913
01:07:57,494 --> 01:07:59,287
Okay.

914
01:07:59,412 --> 01:08:01,247
I need you to call
the sheriff

915
01:08:01,331 --> 01:08:03,625
and have him
meet us there.

916
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:05,543
And-- are you serious?

917
01:08:05,627 --> 01:08:08,380
What's the number?
What's the fucking number?!

918
01:08:08,463 --> 01:08:10,382
- 
- What's the fucking number?

919
01:08:10,465 --> 01:08:12,342
Don't be scared,
kiddo.

920
01:08:12,467 --> 01:08:14,302
Don't be scared.

921
01:08:14,386 --> 01:08:15,845
It's going to be okay.

922
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:17,847
Hey, hey, hey!
Listen to me--

923
01:08:17,972 --> 01:08:20,350
remember that little thing
you got from the store?

924
01:08:21,476 --> 01:08:23,728
What was it--
yeah, there it is!

925
01:08:23,812 --> 01:08:26,106
Yeah, it's got
magic powers, right?

926
01:08:26,189 --> 01:08:28,191
Huh? Isn't that
what you told me?

927
01:08:28,316 --> 01:08:29,943
Right? Huh?

928
01:08:30,068 --> 01:08:32,404
I was listening,
Miles.

929
01:08:32,487 --> 01:08:35,573
Miles, I was
listening to you.

930
01:08:35,657 --> 01:08:38,785
Don't be scared,
kiddo.

931
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:41,037
Don't be scared.

932
01:08:41,162 --> 01:08:42,997
It's going
to be okay, huh?

933
01:08:43,123 --> 01:08:46,001
Oh, Kim, oh baby.

934
01:08:46,126 --> 01:08:48,628
What a fucking waste.

935
01:08:48,712 --> 01:08:50,880
What a fucking waste.

936
01:08:53,008 --> 01:08:56,344
Give me your hand, Miles.
Give me your hand, buddy.

937
01:08:57,971 --> 01:08:59,639
Yeah...

938
01:09:06,855 --> 01:09:08,857
Watch the door.

939
01:09:11,901 --> 01:09:13,987
Okay, somebody get
his feet!

940
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,741
One, two, three.

941
01:09:17,866 --> 01:09:20,035
It's his abdomen.
Right in here.

942
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,829
Yeah.
Just a second.

943
01:09:26,708 --> 01:09:29,419
I want you to tell Charles I'm
definitely not doing that reshoot.

944
01:09:29,544 --> 01:09:31,504
- Shut up, George.
- What are you going to do...

945
01:09:31,588 --> 01:09:33,340
when you got no one to shush?

946
01:09:33,423 --> 01:09:36,593
I love you. Hang in there.
I got separation issues, you know?

947
01:09:36,718 --> 01:09:38,386
Yeah, I know.

948
01:09:38,511 --> 01:09:40,638
S-s-- s-e-p--

949
01:09:40,722 --> 01:09:43,933
a-r-a-t-i-o-n.

950
01:09:44,059 --> 01:09:45,268
- Dad?
- Hey, Miles.

951
01:09:45,393 --> 01:09:47,270
Miles,
listen to me,

952
01:09:47,395 --> 01:09:50,023
I want you to take care
of your mom.

953
01:09:50,106 --> 01:09:52,275
- All right?
- Dad, what happened?

954
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:53,902
I don't know, kiddo.

955
01:09:54,027 --> 01:09:55,820
Kimmy, Kim.

956
01:09:55,904 --> 01:09:57,989
Ohhh, Kimmy!

957
01:09:58,073 --> 01:10:00,200
Oh, such a beautiful day.

958
01:10:00,283 --> 01:10:02,952
God, I remember
so much about today.

959
01:10:03,078 --> 01:10:04,913
Those eggs and--

960
01:10:04,996 --> 01:10:06,915
a drive, and--

961
01:10:06,998 --> 01:10:09,584
we went sledding,
Miles and me.

962
01:10:11,169 --> 01:10:14,464
You're my family,
my family, my family.

963
01:10:15,924 --> 01:10:18,760
Oh, Kim, Kim.

964
01:10:18,885 --> 01:10:21,638
Kim, you remember--
do you remember?

965
01:10:21,763 --> 01:10:24,391
Do you remember
his first week home?

966
01:10:24,474 --> 01:10:27,435
Do you remember he kept us up
for two nights screaming?

967
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,772
Yeah, I thought we'd
never make it through.

968
01:10:31,856 --> 01:10:34,234
Listen, I'm always going
to be with you.

969
01:10:47,956 --> 01:10:49,791
Come on, sweetie,
it's going to be okay.

970
01:10:49,916 --> 01:10:51,668
Take my hand-- my hand.

971
01:10:53,712 --> 01:10:56,297
Second down and 9

972
01:10:56,423 --> 01:10:58,133
at the 35...

973
01:11:01,261 --> 01:11:03,555
I'm sorry, sweetie.

974
01:11:03,638 --> 01:11:05,974
Um, excuse me.
Mrs. McLaren?

975
01:11:06,099 --> 01:11:08,768
- Yes.
- Hi, I'm Tom Hale.

976
01:11:08,893 --> 01:11:10,729
Hey, there,
buckaroo.

977
01:11:10,812 --> 01:11:12,522
I'm the sheriff.

978
01:11:12,647 --> 01:11:14,774
Do you mind telling me
what happened?

979
01:11:14,899 --> 01:11:16,776
My husband--

980
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:19,446
my husband was shot.

981
01:11:19,571 --> 01:11:21,406
I think he was,
by this man

982
01:11:21,489 --> 01:11:23,491
who we saw at--

983
01:11:23,575 --> 01:11:25,994
at Braintree Road.
His name was Otis.

984
01:11:26,119 --> 01:11:27,912
- Otis?
- Do you know who he is?

985
01:11:27,996 --> 01:11:29,456
Mmm, yeah, well--

986
01:11:29,539 --> 01:11:31,458
I'd seen him before.
He was--

987
01:11:31,541 --> 01:11:33,585
he seemed capable of--

988
01:11:33,668 --> 01:11:35,795
Now, Mrs. McLaren,
we don't know for certain

989
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,339
that your husband
was shot.

990
01:11:37,464 --> 01:11:39,424
Mrs. McLaren?

991
01:11:39,507 --> 01:11:41,634
Your husband was shot
once in the side

992
01:11:41,718 --> 01:11:43,053
with a high-powered rifle.

993
01:11:43,178 --> 01:11:45,513
The bullet grazed his liver
and the doctors

994
01:11:45,597 --> 01:11:48,308
are recommending
emergency surgery-- immediately.

995
01:11:48,391 --> 01:11:50,101
There'll be some papers
for you to sign,

996
01:11:50,185 --> 01:11:51,686
so if you'll
wait right here...

997
01:11:59,819 --> 01:12:02,322
Well, do you
know him or not?!

998
01:12:02,405 --> 01:12:04,115
Yeah, Otis Stooky.

999
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:05,867
- What?
- Pardon?

1000
01:12:05,992 --> 01:12:07,535
That's the place
we're staying,

1001
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:09,204
- the Stooky house.
- Really?

1002
01:12:09,329 --> 01:12:11,039
That's where Otis
grew up.

1003
01:12:11,164 --> 01:12:13,667
- What?
- Yeah, his mother died,

1004
01:12:13,792 --> 01:12:15,627
and then she left it
to Otis' sister.

1005
01:12:15,710 --> 01:12:18,338
Sister sold the place
and moved down to Florida.

1006
01:12:18,463 --> 01:12:20,507
Christ.

1007
01:12:20,632 --> 01:12:23,218
You mind telling me exactly
what happened, Mrs. McLaren?

1008
01:12:23,343 --> 01:12:25,345
Last night we--

1009
01:12:25,428 --> 01:12:27,305
we hit a deer with our car.

1010
01:12:27,389 --> 01:12:29,766
It was a fluke.
These men came out of the woods

1011
01:12:29,891 --> 01:12:32,894
and one of them was named Otis.
Oh, I can't believe this!

1012
01:12:33,019 --> 01:12:35,438
Wrong place,
wrong time.

1013
01:12:35,563 --> 01:12:37,399
Mrs. McLaren?

1014
01:12:37,482 --> 01:12:39,776
With your permission,
the y'll get started right away.

1015
01:12:42,529 --> 01:12:46,199
Oh, God!
I cannot fucking believe this.

1016
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,419
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1017
01:13:51,598 --> 01:13:53,266
Miles, help me.

1018
01:14:51,908 --> 01:14:54,661
Jack,
this is Tom Hale.

1019
01:14:54,744 --> 01:14:57,664
I want you to meet me
up at Battle Creek Road.

1020
01:14:57,747 --> 01:14:59,749
Otis Stooky's place.

1021
01:14:59,874 --> 01:15:01,459
I need backup.

1022
01:15:01,543 --> 01:15:03,586
Do you copy? Over.

1023
01:16:20,455 --> 01:16:23,500
Hey! Otis, you in there?

1024
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:25,669
Tom Hale.

1025
01:16:59,661 --> 01:17:01,621
Hey!

1026
01:17:01,705 --> 01:17:04,457
It's the sheriff.
You in there, Otis?

1027
01:17:04,541 --> 01:17:06,918
What do you want,
Sheriff?

1028
01:17:07,002 --> 01:17:09,546
I want you to step outside
for just a moment, Otis.

1029
01:17:15,802 --> 01:17:17,595
What is it, Tom Hale?

1030
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:19,723
Those people staying
up at the Stooky place,

1031
01:17:19,848 --> 01:17:20,932
they filed a complaint.

1032
01:17:21,016 --> 01:17:22,934
I just want
to ask you some questions.

1033
01:17:23,018 --> 01:17:25,395
You come down
to the station with me?

1034
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,772
What kind of complaint?

1035
01:17:27,856 --> 01:17:30,734
Ah, come on, Otis.
Do me a favor.

1036
01:17:30,859 --> 01:17:31,818
They're from the city.

1037
01:17:31,943 --> 01:17:34,529
I've just got to go through
all the formalities.

1038
01:17:37,032 --> 01:17:38,992
What'd they say happened?

1039
01:17:39,117 --> 01:17:40,618
Oh, I don't know.

1040
01:17:40,702 --> 01:17:43,038
Just something about
them hitting a deer

1041
01:17:43,121 --> 01:17:44,873
and you was there,

1042
01:17:44,998 --> 01:17:46,624
and I got to--

1043
01:17:46,708 --> 01:17:49,419
I just got to get a statement
from you, that's all.

1044
01:17:50,628 --> 01:17:52,881
- Aw, shit, Tom!
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

1045
01:17:53,006 --> 01:17:54,716
These people come up
from the city,

1046
01:17:54,841 --> 01:17:56,885
they act like they own
the damn place.

1047
01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:58,470
Look, I get it every day.

1048
01:18:01,556 --> 01:18:03,683
That fucking Ben Stratton,
you know.

1049
01:18:03,767 --> 01:18:06,353
Raising our taxes,
kissing these people's ass.

1050
01:18:06,478 --> 01:18:08,772
Yeah, that's right.

1051
01:18:08,897 --> 01:18:11,024
You come with me now, huh?

1052
01:18:11,149 --> 01:18:13,068
I got Jack stopping by
in a moment.

1053
01:18:13,151 --> 01:18:16,196
I'd like you to come down
with me now, just to-- you know--

1054
01:18:16,279 --> 01:18:18,698
just to keep it
simple, huh?

1055
01:18:18,782 --> 01:18:19,949
Well...

1056
01:18:20,075 --> 01:18:21,117
okay, Tom.

1057
01:18:21,242 --> 01:18:23,203
Right, so we can say
we did it, okay?

1058
01:18:23,328 --> 01:18:26,039
Okay. Sure.

1059
01:18:26,164 --> 01:18:27,707
Damn.

1060
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:30,251
I was just going
to watch the ballgame.

1061
01:18:30,377 --> 01:18:32,629
Yeah, I know, sorry
to put you out and all.

1062
01:18:32,754 --> 01:18:34,506
That game was
just getting started

1063
01:18:34,589 --> 01:18:36,591
when I stopped by
the hospital earlier--

1064
01:18:41,471 --> 01:18:43,473
What you doing
at the hospital, Tom?

1065
01:18:43,598 --> 01:18:45,308
Routine stuff.

1066
01:18:47,852 --> 01:18:49,062
You know...

1067
01:18:49,145 --> 01:18:52,107
I don't think I'm gonna go down
to the station there, Tom.

1068
01:18:52,232 --> 01:18:54,901
- What's that?
- I think you know what I'm saying.

1069
01:18:54,984 --> 01:18:57,487
Otis, I know it's been
you shooting up

1070
01:18:57,612 --> 01:18:59,948
the walls at
the Stooky place.

1071
01:19:00,031 --> 01:19:02,450
- Why do you say that?
- People see you there.

1072
01:19:03,785 --> 01:19:06,287
I spend time at Everett's,
you know that.

1073
01:19:06,413 --> 01:19:08,123
He's got that
shooting range.

1074
01:19:08,248 --> 01:19:10,583
Listen, Otis, I know you
got dealt a bad hand

1075
01:19:10,667 --> 01:19:13,378
with that house and all,
but a lot of people got problems.

1076
01:19:13,461 --> 01:19:16,297
City guy lets me take
the shortcut through the property.

1077
01:19:16,423 --> 01:19:18,091
Yeah.

1078
01:19:18,174 --> 01:19:19,968
You know, Otis,
I was gonna let you off

1079
01:19:20,093 --> 01:19:22,220
shooting up that place
and all, but...

1080
01:19:22,303 --> 01:19:25,390
I want you to come down
to the station with me now.

1081
01:19:25,473 --> 01:19:28,727
That really
what it is, Tom?

1082
01:19:28,810 --> 01:19:30,311
What do you mean?

1083
01:19:30,395 --> 01:19:32,856
You come all the way
out here over that?

1084
01:19:32,981 --> 01:19:34,899
Yeah, they're mad as hell.

1085
01:19:34,983 --> 01:19:37,485
Look, I got Jack
stopping by.

1086
01:19:37,569 --> 01:19:39,612
You coming with me
or not?

1087
01:19:42,574 --> 01:19:45,326
Okay. I'm coming.

1088
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,289
I don't want to slap
the cuffs on you,

1089
01:19:49,372 --> 01:19:51,666
just to take you down
and give you a $30 fine.

1090
01:19:53,668 --> 01:19:55,962
- Coat.
- Right.

1091
01:20:15,315 --> 01:20:16,858
Don't lie, Tom.

1092
01:21:24,009 --> 01:21:27,095
Give me my liver.

1093
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:29,139
What--?

1094
01:21:33,351 --> 01:21:36,187
Give me my liver.

1095
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:27,572
Hey...

1096
01:22:28,782 --> 01:22:31,242
You'll be okay.
You fainted, sweetie.

1097
01:22:31,326 --> 01:22:34,412
You'll be okay, Miles.

1098
01:24:01,958 --> 01:24:04,252
Wha--
what are you?!

1099
01:24:04,336 --> 01:24:06,921
The devil?

1100
01:24:08,048 --> 01:24:09,883
Fuck you!

1101
01:25:28,712 --> 01:25:30,171
I'm sorry, Mrs. McLaren,

1102
01:25:30,338 --> 01:25:32,841
there was nothing
we could do.

1103
01:26:26,811 --> 01:26:29,731
So you get ready.
I'll be right back.

1104
01:26:29,814 --> 01:26:31,024
- Yeah, man?
- Yeah.

1105
01:26:31,107 --> 01:26:32,734
Yeah, man.

1106
01:26:32,859 --> 01:26:34,569
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

1107
01:26:34,694 --> 01:26:36,905
Sledding, sledding,
sledding.

1108
01:26:41,743 --> 01:26:45,663
Where even the worst thing
can be seen in another way.

1109
01:26:54,756 --> 01:26:57,634
Nobody believes
in spirits anymore.

1110
01:26:57,759 --> 01:27:00,595
Doesn't mean
the y're not there.

1111
01:27:00,679 --> 01:27:02,806
I'm getting you out of that ditch.

1112
01:27:02,931 --> 01:27:05,266
- You could have asked.
- No, no, no.

1113
01:28:05,410 --> 01:28:08,288
If I fall down

1114
01:28:08,371 --> 01:28:12,250
I'll try to get
back up

1115
01:28:14,711 --> 01:28:17,297
I'll catch you rain

1116
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:21,384
In this paper cup

1117
01:28:23,261 --> 01:28:26,681
And you can
call my name

1118
01:28:26,806 --> 01:28:32,270
And I will come

1119
01:28:32,354 --> 01:28:36,107
I won't be far away

1120
01:28:36,191 --> 01:28:40,653
No matter what,

1121
01:28:40,737 --> 01:28:43,698
And you can hold out

1122
01:28:43,823 --> 01:28:48,328
Hold out, hold out

1123
01:28:48,453 --> 01:28:52,832
Hold out, hold out

1124
01:28:52,916 --> 01:28:58,963
Hold out, hold out...

1125
01:29:13,853 --> 01:29:17,565
And if you lose
your way

1126
01:29:17,691 --> 01:29:21,861
I will steer
you straight

1127
01:29:23,071 --> 01:29:26,700
And if you lie awake

1128
01:29:26,825 --> 01:29:30,745
I'll sing you to sleep

1129
01:29:32,414 --> 01:29:36,126
And you can call my name

1130
01:29:36,251 --> 01:29:41,131
And I will come

1131
01:29:41,256 --> 01:29:45,427
I won't be far away

1132
01:29:45,552 --> 01:29:49,639
No matter what

1133
01:29:49,764 --> 01:29:53,101
And you can hold out

1134
01:29:53,226 --> 01:29:57,397
Hold out, hold out

1135
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:02,277
Hold out, hold out

1136
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:09,617
Hold out, hold out...

1137
01:30:23,882 --> 01:30:26,801
If I fall down

1138
01:30:26,926 --> 01:30:30,889
I'll try to get
back up

1139
01:30:33,058 --> 01:30:36,061
I'll catch you rain

1140
01:30:36,144 --> 01:30:40,023
In this paper cup

1141
01:30:41,649 --> 01:30:45,028
And you can call
my name

1142
01:30:45,153 --> 01:30:50,784
And I will come

1143
01:30:50,867 --> 01:30:54,913
I won't be far away

1144
01:30:54,996 --> 01:30:59,334
No matter what

1145
01:30:59,459 --> 01:31:02,462
And you can hold out

1146
01:31:02,545 --> 01:31:06,800
Hold out, hold out

1147
01:31:06,883 --> 01:31:11,346
Hold out, hold out

1148
01:31:11,429 --> 01:31:19,479
Hold out, hold out.
