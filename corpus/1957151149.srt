1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,760
<i>It was the best of times, it</i>
<i>was the whompernest of times.</i>

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,520
<i>It was just a regular school</i>
<i>day that started out quiet.</i>

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,160
<i>Harmless. Downright tender.</i>

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,280
<i>But tenderness</i>
<i>never lasts forever,</i>

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,120
<i>and before we knew it, that day</i>
<i>would take us to a place</i>

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,000
<i>none of us thought</i>
<i>we'd ever go again.</i>

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,400
- (bell rings)
- (Prickly) Lecture's over.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,360
Oh, man. I can't believe
we had to sit for a whole hour

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,680
listening to Prickly
talk about foot hygiene.

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,400
And that was the grossest, most
disgusting video of all time.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,680
It's OK, guys. We've got a whole
hour of recess to get over it.

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,920
I don't know, TJ. All that
foot talk kind of made me woozy.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,360
I think I'd better
go see Nurse Kramer.

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,680
- Oh.
- Poor guy.

15
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,440
- He'll be OK.
- Indeed.

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,280
Beneath that quivering exterior
beats a heart of steal.

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,600
- So what'll it be? Kickball?
- Oh, yeah!

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,200
No! We gotta do something
that takes my mind off feet.

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,760
This would be an excellent time
to try out my new croquet set.

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,080
- Cro-what set?
- It's a British game,

21
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,920
very popular with
the upper classes. Shall we?

22
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,960
So we hit each other
with these hammers?

23
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,000
I think I'm gonna
like this game.

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,720
Oh, no. You use these mallets
to shoot wickets.

25
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,520
We just need to find
a large, empty field to play on.

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,320
That might be
a bit of a problem.

27
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,920
Oh, man,
there's no space anywhere.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,760
It seems my dream of playing

29
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,160
the backyard game of kings
is not to be.

30
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,680
Hey, wait. What about
the old, abandoned playground?

31
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,680
Yeah! No-one ever goes there!

32
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,720
A brilliant idea!
My dream is restored!

33
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,680
Ah, here she is -
the old, abandoned playground.

34
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,720
Now this is more like it.
No one's gonna bug us back here.

35
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,920
Yeah, well, I'm not so sure.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,880
I forgot how eerie
this place was.

37
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,880
The terrible memories
are flooding back to me.

38
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,960
Don't tell me you're worried

39
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,640
because of
what happened last time.

40
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,800
They promised they
wouldn't come here.

41
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,800
I guess that's true.

42
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,120
Excuse me, but I understand
the key to croquet enjoyment

43
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,120
- is to start a croquet game.
- You got it. What do we do?

44
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,640
Everyone take a hoop, spread
out and put them in the ground.

45
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,360
Yeah. And Gretch? Spinelli?
Take it from me.

46
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,720
All you've gotta worry about is
getting your wickets stomped...

47
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,440
- Argh!
- Argh!

48
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,680
Argh!

49
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,560
- Nothing to worry about, huh?
- He, he.

50
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,840
Big Kids, Big Kids, Big Kids.

51
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,280
Arr, arr. You are prisoner.
You come with us.

52
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,320
(Mikey)
Hello there, small people.

53
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,400
Any of you hungry?
When I get out of here

54
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,440
I'm making
Kindergartener pancakes.

55
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,720
Quiet, Big Kid. You no
make pancakes. You in jail.

56
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,200
- But we didn't do anything!
- We're croquet enthusiasts.

57
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,680
This goes against every rule

58
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,480
of Big Kid/Kindergartener
relations.

59
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,440
Since the last incident,

60
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,600
the Old Playground has been
designated Big-Kid territory.

61
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,840
Captain Sticky, you're in charge
here. Tell them to let us go.

62
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,000
Captain Sticky
not in charge no more.

63
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,760
You're not?
I demand to know who is.

64
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,400
- Me am in charge!
- Whoa! Me get out of way!

65
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,760
- Me Chief Stinky.
- Never heard of you.

66
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,880
- Me new around here.
- That explains it.

67
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,480
Maybe where you come from,
Big Kids deserve to be tied up.

68
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,000
- But at this school we're nice.
- Big Kid tell lies.

69
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,840
- Not listen to Big Kid!
- What you talking about?

70
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,120
I don't care
if those guys listen, Stinky.

71
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,760
- They already know me.
- You play with Kindergarteners?

72
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,920
- As a matter of fact, I did.
- You trick Kindergarteners.

73
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,520
No. Listen, Stinky, and you'll
see. It was nothing like that.

74
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,280
It was beautiful, although
it started off pretty crumby.

75
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,160
Sort of like today.

76
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,960
Kirby Puckett is the greatest
outfielder that every lived.

77
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,600
You gotta be kidding me. Any of
these guys is twice as good.

78
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,160
- He's short. He's tubby.
- He's got an average of 318.

79
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,720
What about Babe Ruth?
Reggie Jackson? Willy Mays?

80
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,640
None of them
hold a candle to Kirby Puckett.

81
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,640
You wouldn't know talent
if it... Hey, wait a second.

82
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,760
- Don't change the subject.
- No, Teej. Look!

83
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,360
- Huh? What?
- The Old Playground?

84
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,000
I've heard about this place but
I thought it was just a myth.

85
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,240
It hasn't been used
since the seventies.

86
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,120
We shouldn't be here, man.
It really gives me the creeps.

87
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,160
Yeah. Let's... Argh!

88
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,000
- What the...
- Help! Get me down from here!

89
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,800
- (shouting)
- Oh, no! Kindergarteners!

90
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,640
But where are they coming from?

91
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,920
Get out of here, man!
Go! Save yourself!

92
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,480
(shouting)

93
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,160
Ouch! Ouch! Ooh! Ow! Ouch!

94
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,760
TJ!

95
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,360
- Argh!
- Vince! Are you OK?

96
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,800
TJ captured... Gotta help...

97
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,160
You'll be OK, man. You'll be OK.

98
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,040
We came through this clearing
and that's where we...

99
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,920
- He's gone!
- Poor TJ!

100
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,280
His baseball card.

101
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,360
Why did I leave him?
I should have stayed.

102
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,120
I should have done something.

103
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,000
You did what any kid
would have done.

104
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,960
Yeah. Ran and left your friend
hanging there.

105
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,200
Look, they've probably
taken him back to their pen.

106
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,240
We don't have much time.
Let's go.

107
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,120
The place is deserted.
They could be anywhere.

108
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,280
They've probably migrated
to their winter encampment.

109
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,800
But what have they done with TJ?

110
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,440
- Maybe they let him go.
- Maybe he fought his way out.

111
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,560
I'm afraid there's a possibility
of a far less pleasant scenario.

112
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,560
We've got to find him, you guys.

113
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,880
Wherever we have to go, however
long it takes, we must find him.

114
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,440
We're with you, Vince. Let's go.

115
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,320
I understand they use
every part of the tricycle.

116
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,400
<i>The unthinkable has happened -</i>

117
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,880
<i>I am a prisoner</i>
<i>of the Kindergarteners.</i>

118
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,600
<i>Time passes slowly here.</i>

119
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,880
<i>Why they've taken me... What</i>
<i>they're going to do with me...</i>

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,640
<i>Who knows?</i>

121
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,080
(grunting debate)

122
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,040
<i>Even they can't seem to agree.</i>

123
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,120
<i>The one in the paper hat</i>
<i>seems to be their leader.</i>

124
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,880
<i>They call him Captain Sticky...</i>
<i>for obvious reasons.</i>

125
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,000
- Big Kid.
- No. Me TJ.

126
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,280
- Big Kid!
- OK! Whatever you say.

127
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,680
- You food.
- Me? Food? No, not me!

128
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,120
Don't taste good.
Me taste bad. Yucky poo-poo.

129
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,600
- Food!
- Oh, you want to give me food!

130
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,440
(all) You eat! You eat!

131
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,440
Uh... no, that's OK.
I'm not hungry.

132
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,880
- Grr!
- Maybe later?

133
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,720
<i>I'm safe for now.</i>
<i>But I can't help wondering -</i>

134
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,800
<i>are they giving me food out of</i>
<i>some sort of twisted kindness,</i>

135
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,120
<i>or are they just</i>
<i>trying to fatten me up?</i>

136
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,840
Gulp!

137
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,600
Chocolate.

138
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,240
- They were here.
- Yeah, but it's dry.

139
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,320
The trail's cold.
They could be anywhere by now.

140
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,160
- We're not giving up.
- No-one said we were.

141
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,440
Actually,
I may have said something.

142
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,600
But we're not. We're gonna find
TJ or we're gonna die trying.

143
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,560
<i>I've lost</i>
<i>all track of time now.</i>

144
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,760
<i>So far the savages</i>
<i>have left me alone,</i>

145
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,320
<i>but I don't know</i>
<i>how much longer I can hold out.</i>

146
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,760
<i>They nabbed me before lunch</i>
<i>and if I don't eat soon,</i>

147
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,960
<i>it won't matter what they do.</i>

148
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,640
<i>I've got one job now -</i>
<i>staying alive.</i>

149
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,720
Hmm! Nougat!

150
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,040
<i>Can it be?</i>
<i>They're letting me go?</i>

151
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,360
Well uh...
thanks for everything.

152
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,640
I guess I'll just be
hitting the old road.

153
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,280
On second thought, maybe
I'll just hang out for a while.

154
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,120
Nice yardsticks.

155
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,600
Finger-paints! Are you kidding?
That's for Kinder...

156
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,720
Grr!

157
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,560
OK. So who has... got yellow?

158
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,320
Eugh.

159
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,160
- I didn't see nothing!
- We know they were here.

160
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,160
I don't know
what you're talking about.

161
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,280
I...I... OK, OK, they were here!

162
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,320
It was terrible.
Me and the others

163
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,120
was hanging out
on the jungle gym

164
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,400
and suddenly
they was all around us.

165
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,600
We was lucky to get out alive.

166
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,880
- Was a fourth grader with them?
- I don't know.

167
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,880
I said was a fourth grader
with them?

168
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,200
I don't know! I didn't see!
I just ran, OK!

169
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,440
I just ran.

170
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,000
(boy sobs)

171
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,360
Let him go, Vince.
He didn't see anything.

172
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,080
(cries)

173
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,880
But I'll tell you one thing,

174
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,240
if there was
a fourth grader with them,

175
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,360
I wouldn't hold out much hope.

176
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,000
<i>I don't know what's going on.</i>

177
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,960
<i>A part of me knows that</i>
<i>what's happening is terrible.</i>

178
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,840
<i>And yet I... I...</i>
<i>I'm having fun!</i>

179
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,160
Nap time.

180
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,240
- Nap!
- No, I'm too old for naps.

181
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
- Nap!
- (sighs)

182
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,520
- Hey, this feels pretty nice.
- Nap good.

183
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,400
Yeah, yeah. Nap good.

184
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,240
(snoring)

185
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,440
(giggling)

186
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,560
No!

187
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,920
We've looked everywhere, Vince.

188
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,840
Face it.
We're not gonna find him.

189
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,000
If the Kindergarteners still
have him, we may not want to.

190
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,360
We can't give up.
This is TJ we're talking about.

191
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,600
Guys! Guys! Look what I found!

192
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,360
A half-eaten lollipop,
and it's still wet.

193
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,840
- But that means...
- Right. They can't be far now.

194
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,200
- I knew it! Let's go.
- Wait!

195
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,680
- What is it?
- Can I have the lollipop?

196
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,240
Gr!

197
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,280
There it is. Let's go.

198
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,800
- They're gone!
- We must have just missed them.

199
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,720
We were so close. So close!

200
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,360
- Hey, look! A Winger Dinger!
- Whoa!

201
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,840
(all shout)

202
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,920
Well, at least we've found them.

203
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,720
What are they going to do to us?

204
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,120
Who knows? Probably
the same thing they did to TJ.

205
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,400
Oh, heartless fiends!

206
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,080
- Oh, man, it's TJ!
- What have they done to him?

207
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,400
TJ? Is it really you?

208
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,400
TJ gone. I Big Kid now.

209
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,000
- He's become one of them.
- TJ, listen to me.

210
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,080
You're not one of them.
You're one of us.

211
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,320
No! I am Kindergartener!
I am Kindergartener!

212
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,600
No, you're not a Kindergartener.
You're TJ. And I'm Vince.

213
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,200
- Vi-ince.
- That's right, TJ,

214
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,200
and this is Spinelli, and that's
Mikey and Gretchen and Gus.

215
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,680
- You're one of us.
- No!

216
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,160
You're a fourth grader.
You don't like finger-painting.

217
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,920
You like kickball and
four square and Little League.

218
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,440
- Little League...
- And you love baseball. Look.

219
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,520
Kir-by Puck-ett.

220
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,400
Yes, TJ! Yes!

221
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,160
(cries)

222
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,240
It'll be OK, man. It'll be OK.

223
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,800
Here. Let me tie them for you.

224
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,880
Shoes. Underpants.
I can't get used to this stuff.

225
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,840
Hey, man, it takes time.
You were out there for hours.

226
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,080
But soon you'll be
back to normal.

227
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,040
Whatever happened out there,
you can put it all behind you.

228
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,360
Yes. Your terrifying ordeal
is over.

229
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,880
No, you guys. You don't
understand. I... I liked it.

230
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,240
- You liked it?
- Imagine it, guys...

231
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,080
Kindergarteners eat and
drink whatever they want,

232
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,680
go wherever they want to go.
There's no rules.

233
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,880
When you paint,
you don't use a brush.

234
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,640
You stick your hands in
the paint and feel the colour.

235
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,800
And you take naps, guys.
Right in the middle of the day.

236
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,080
Do you have any idea
how refreshing that is?

237
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,720
But TJ, it's so primitive!

238
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,680
Primitive? Maybe so.
But I was free, you guys. Free.

239
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,440
There's a part of me
that wishes I could go back.

240
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,400
But TJ, you can't go back.

241
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,440
He's right.
Even they can't go back.

242
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,240
- What?
- Don't you see?

243
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,280
Their way of life
is coming to an end.

244
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,120
But this time next year,
they'll be first graders.

245
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,680
(sighs)

246
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,320
So, Chief Stinky, in a way,
I am a Kindergartener.

247
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,600
I'm one of you. And I can
vouch for my friends here.

248
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,920
They're A-OK.
So how's about you let us go?

249
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,120
No! Big Kid lie!
Big Kids are bad!

250
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,640
Pyjama Boy, watch Big Kids
while Stinky think up boom-boom.

251
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,360
- Boom-boom? What's that?
- Big Kids get punishment.

252
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,760
- Like what?
- Something bad. Big, big bad.

253
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,920
Now that Stinky's not watching,
Hector can let us go.

254
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,440
We'll make it look like
we conked you on the head.

255
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,040
- Big Kids stay right here.
- What's with you?

256
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,400
- I thought you were nice.
- I thought most of you were.

257
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,240
Have you pint-sized
delinquents gone made?

258
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,960
Emma, Zed, Spencer, Jake.

259
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,200
And yes, you too, little Hector.

260
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,120
You've forgotten
who your friends are.

261
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,800
I believe I shall remind you.

262
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,400
- Brain Girl keep quiet!
- I will not!

263
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,640
There was a day not so long ago

264
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,880
when we let you into our lives
when no-one else would have you.

265
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,560
That's right.
Is it all coming back now?

266
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,880
In case it's not,
allow me to elaborate.

267
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,840
It was going to be another
carefree day of Big Kid fun.

268
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,080
But then Miss Grotke appealed
to our amazing Big Kid instincts

269
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,280
for Big Kid generosity.

270
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,200
Pee Wee Pals.
An idea whose time has come.

271
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,320
For one week,
fourth-grade big trees

272
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,080
have an opportunity to interact
with the kindergarten saplings,

273
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,840
playing, sharing, learning
and caring, during recess.

274
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,400
- (moans)
- Here to explain more

275
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,920
is the architect of the
Pee Wee Pals programme,

276
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,120
our own kindergarten teacher,
Mrs Klemperer.

277
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:08,760
They all just sit there quietly.
Waiting. It's beautiful.

278
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,920
- Mrs Klemperer?
- Huh? Oh, yeah. Um...

279
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,280
I came up with this
Pee Wee Pals thing

280
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,840
to help the little ones
prepare for the numbered grades.

281
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,800
And buy me a little
peace and quiet.

282
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,880
That's all fine,
but what's in it for us?

283
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,720
Good question.
Each of you will take away

284
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,200
a sense of responsibility,

285
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,280
a deeper understanding
of his/herself,

286
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,560
and a better idea
of how we really are all one.

287
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,160
And two tickets to Gonzo World
Water Park and Arcade.

288
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,920
Ooh!

289
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,120
Now, are there any volunteers?

290
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,360
Yes! They're eating it up
like fudge.

291
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,640
- This is Freddie.
- Hiya, Fred. Meet Tubby.

292
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,080
Tubby like Freddy.

293
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,440
Oh man, this is gonna be so
easy. Gonzo World, here we come.

294
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,560
Yeah. I can smell the cotton
candy and the chlorine now.

295
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,640
OK. Only six more left.

296
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,800
Kids, meet your Pee Wee Pals.

297
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,880
Emma.

298
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,520
Jake.

299
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,880
- Cyndi.
- (giggles)

300
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,640
Zed.

301
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,320
- Hector.
- Bee! Catch bee! Eat bee!

302
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,280
- And Spencer.
- (barks)

303
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,600
Run away!

304
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,480
Get 'em!

305
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,080
Seems like they're off
to a copasetic start.

306
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,840
Let's observe from
a safe distance.

307
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,160
You mean like Cleveland?

308
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,280
Oh, man, this is a nightmare.

309
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,200
Remind me why we agreed to this.

310
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,560
- We're the saplings.
- I did it for Gonzo World.

311
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,440
I'm not even sure
it's worth that.

312
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,840
Not worth it? It's Gonzo World!
Have you seen the commercials?

313
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,200
They've got huge water slides
100 feet tall,

314
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,840
rock music piped in the pools,
six types of corn dogs,

315
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,920
and the Eviserator -
Flume of Doom.

316
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,960
You guys stay up here but I'm
getting a ticket to Gonzo World.

317
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,000
TJ's right. No munchkin's
keeping me from tasting

318
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,040
the spray of the world's
most outrageous water park.

319
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,240
I must admit I'm intrigued by
the physics of the Eviserator.

320
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,280
Corn dogs...

321
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,640
This is gonna be cake. We just
gotta keep asking ourselves,

322
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,080
"What's in it for me?"

323
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,360
(barks and snarls)

324
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,560
So, kid, what do you do for fun?

325
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,760
- Spencer eat paper.
- I'm still full from breakfast.

326
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,080
How about marbles?
You ever play marbles?

327
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,000
- Marbles yummy?
- No. But fun? Forget about it.

328
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,160
Now then. This is a textbook.

329
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,040
- Bextook.
- It has few pictures

330
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,120
and a high percentage
of small print.

331
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,720
But it's packed with
the knowledge of human kind.

332
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,040
Isn't that exciting?

333
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,280
This is a ball. Here. Catch.

334
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,080
- Pretty flowers.
- I think I'm gonna spew.

335
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,360
- Smell! Smell!
- Knock it off, will you?

336
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,640
You wander around acting
all ga-ga over weeds

337
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,320
and the world's
gonna eat you alive.

338
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,920
- Yuck.
- Yeah. You gotta get tough.

339
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,040
I got it. Ever arm wrestle?

340
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,240
- Wessle?
- Lesson one. Your equipment.

341
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,360
You've got to like poetry.

342
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,960
"Tiger, tiger, burning bright
in the forest of the night."

343
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,920
- (blows raspberry)
- OK. How about meditation?

344
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,240
Tai Chi?

345
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,840
Oh, Zed, you really know
how to bring a guy down.

346
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,320
No, no, no, Hector!
Stay off of there!

347
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,760
You'll cut yourself climbing
over the sharp points

348
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,800
and fall off and crack your head

349
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,840
and stagger into traffic
without looking

350
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,200
and then never live
to see first grade!

351
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,440
- Monkey bars!
- Wait, wait, wait!

352
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,800
Monkey bars are a death trap
in primary colours!

353
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,920
- Ooh! Candy!
- Not candy. Toys.

354
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,640
Take this big marble and knock
the smaller marbles out.

355
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,480
Watch and learn.
You watching, kid?

356
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,440
Spencer! No!

357
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,960
What?
Who's responsible for this?

358
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,440
I demand an inquisition.
Nobody leaves the yard.

359
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,400
- Man in crown go boom!
- Let's get out of here.

360
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,040
Shouldn't we intervene
in some of these situations?

361
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,920
The big kids are
having a tough time.

362
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,640
That's all part of
the Pee Wee Pals philosophy.

363
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,520
- What time is it?
- Quarter after. Why?

364
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,680
Time for my medication. Aah.

365
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,840
- I can't find them, sir.
- Keep looking.

366
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,200
That marble stunt
was not good, Spencer.

367
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,120
We could have gotten hurt.

368
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,800
- Me want hat.
- Are you nuts? This hat is me!

369
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,960
It's who I am.
Nobody wears this hat but me.

370
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,400
Now what are
we gonna do for fun?

371
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,440
Too short for that.

372
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,320
Too stumpy for that.

373
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,880
Too fragile for that.

374
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,640
Aha.

375
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,920
Ah, the swings.
Can't top a classic.

376
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,160
You know how to pump, kid?
It's 50% legs, 50% arms

377
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,640
and 50% attitude.

378
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,760
Don't just sit there! Pump!

379
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,120
I doing it! I doing it!

380
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,480
Stabilise! You're breaking up!

381
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,200
(screaming)

382
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,760
Pah! Pah! You little weasel!

383
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,040
I was only ten swings away
from my all-time record!

384
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,480
She eat sand! She eat sand!

385
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,960
I'll get you for this,
Detweiler!

386
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,360
Here's a tip.
Don't cross Swinger Girl.

387
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,000
Years of pumping have given her
wicked upper body strength.

388
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,040
- (pants)
- What's the matter with you?

389
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,200
- I did all the running.
- Thirsty.

390
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,240
Kids. I wonder if the others
are having this much fun.

391
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,280
- Repeat after me. The rain...
- The rain...

392
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,160
- in Spain...
- in pain...

393
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,600
falls mainly in the temperate
zone south west of the Pyrenees.

394
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,000
Bloobee, bloobee,
bloo, bloo, bloo.

395
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,920
- Would you like to play a game?
- Game, game, game!

396
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,320
It's a very simple little
board game called... chess.

397
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,040
And he's out of there!
I mean, not too bad, rookie.

398
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,520
Try to get more loft. I like to
visualise shooting down a blimp.

399
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,240
Shoot the blimp!

400
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,160
(both strain)

401
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,680
No shame in losing, kid. What do
you say? Best eight out of 15?

402
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,520
I see a lion with shoes on.

403
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,920
Clown shoes.

404
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,760
Hector! Gotcha!

405
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,960
Hector, I told you
not to play over here.

406
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,960
Listen to Gus. He's pretty "with
it" when it comes to safety.

407
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,200
He taught us to contact
the electric company

408
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,680
to find out about cables
before starting any dig.

409
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,360
Wow!

410
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,600
Safety Man!

411
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,240
Thirsty! Thirsty!

412
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,520
Hold up.

413
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,560
(whistles)

414
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,160
I got a hunch that that one's
booby-trapped. Let me see.

415
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,160
- (laughter)
- Hey, let me play!

416
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,240
Or I'll make up something
to tell Finster on you!

417
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,360
Man, that's a tasty way
to cool off.

418
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,400
What are you
babbling about, Detweiler?

419
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,000
The drinking fountain. Jinky
Soda's doing product testing.

420
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,960
They rigged it to dispense
black cherry lime cooler.

421
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,960
Outta my way!

422
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,440
(all laugh)

423
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,120
Oh, man, that was classic.
Do I have an eye or what, kid?

424
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,880
Kid?

425
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,120
You little rodent! Cut it out!

426
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,360
Get back here with
that punk kid, Detweiler!

427
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,320
That, if I'm not mistaked,
am checkmate.

428
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,120
Excellent use
of the Drake-Shiller offence.

429
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,480
Excellent fake-out, Jake.

430
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,640
That's your nickname!
Jake the Fake. Give me ten.

431
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,560
You have learned well, kid.

432
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,320
That's Cyndi to you, kid.

433
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,080
Wait a darn minute.
I want a rematch.

434
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,280
Cos that was way too fun!

435
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,160
Stay back, Safety Man. Danger!

436
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,240
Now you're getting it.
Beware doesn't mean be afraid.

437
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,320
It means be aware.

438
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,720
That looks like
a fish on a trike.

439
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,680
Yeah. And that one looks like

440
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,200
a double-decker bus
with a rabbit on top.

441
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,920
Winger Dinger?

442
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,680
- Should we call them in?
- No. Just a few more minutes.

443
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,320
Does the book indicate
we should let them play longer?

444
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,480
No, the book indicates
that Lieutenant Chapeau

445
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,440
is about to take Guinevere into
his well-muscled arms and...

446
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,720
- Gert!
- All right, all right.

447
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,920
(whistles)

448
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,880
This is so strange!
Good, but strange.

449
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,120
- My kids are almost behaving!
- We thought it'd be tough

450
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,440
but the little munchkins turned
out to be pretty cool after all.

451
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,960
- Hey, I think I'm one short.
- Where are TJ and his sapling?

452
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,960
- Psst! We're down here!
- TJ! What happened to you?

453
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:08,120
Oh, nothing. Except this little
monster almost got me killed.

454
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,000
I thought this would be easy -
watch a kid, go to Gonzo World.

455
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,000
Instead I get bruised,
splashed, kicked,

456
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,400
hunted, threatened, chased and
nearly beaten up three times.

457
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,920
This kid is... is... just like
me when I was in kindergarten.

458
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,360
- I had a blast!
- A blast! Yay, TJ!

459
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,760
Kid, you'll go far.
You just need the right breaks,

460
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,400
a special group of friends,

461
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,560
and of course,
the proper head gear.

462
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,160
Teej, are you N-U-T-S?
That's your hat!

463
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,800
It's OK. I'm gonna see
the little sapling tomorrow.

464
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,720
They're angels!
They're practically adults!

465
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,080
The peace! The quiet! I might
even be able to get them to nap!

466
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,760
Class, let's go inside.
It's time to put away our toys.

467
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,400
(all scream)

468
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,960
Ah! Ooh! Oh, my aching neck!

469
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,920
Well, guys, it turned out
to be a good recess after all.

470
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,840
Yeah. I got some exercise,
made a new pal,

471
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,400
and I'm going to Gonzo World.
There's no downside.

472
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,600
There he is!

473
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,160
Dang. I was hoping they wouldn't
recognise me. Gotta run.

474
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,000
OK. So now that
I think about it,

475
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,320
maybe we didn't want
anything to do with you at first

476
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,720
and maybe TJ did get into
a lot of trouble,

477
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,440
but we befriended you
nonetheless.

478
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,840
It's only fair to expect the
same friendship from you now.

479
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,560
Sorry, Brain Girl,
but Chief Stinky scary.

480
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,600
Stinky huge, Stinky huge.

481
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,040
- So Big Kids bad.
- Boo, Big Kids!

482
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,520
This is unbelievable. Simply by
being large, loud and pungent,

483
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,720
Chief Stinky has them
completely intimidated.

484
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,480
They'll do anything for him
and nothing for us.

485
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,720
Maybe, Gretchen, but maybe not.

486
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,480
There's still one Kindergartener
I know will help us.

487
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,520
- Who's that?
- My friend Tubby, of course.

488
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,840
Tubby and I formed a friendship
that will overcome any obstacle.

489
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,640
Big Kid stop
talking about Tubby.

490
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,840
Why, look. Here Tubby is now.
Hello, Tubby.

491
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,240
- Tubby never met you.
- But of course you have.

492
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,680
Tubby not remember nothing.

493
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,960
Oh. Then I'd be happy
to remind you.

494
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,800
It was a day all other students

495
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,000
look forward to
with great anticipation.

496
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,000
But not me. For me, it had
always been a day of anguish.

497
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,240
That's enough, Trumpet Boy.
Students, loyal subjects,

498
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,120
it's time for the
25th Annual Kindergarten Derby.

499
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,800
- Kindergarten what?
- Derby, Gus.

500
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,800
Us Big Kids pick
a Kindergartener

501
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,320
to train and run
in the big race.

502
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,800
The Derby runs the little tykes

503
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,920
through the most demanding
course ever designed by a kid.

504
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,520
And the little goof ball
who wins

505
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,120
gets any wish he wants
granted by King Bob.

506
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,440
I love it.
It's pure competition.

507
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,720
- I don't love it.
- Don't start up with that.

508
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,040
The Kindergarten Derby
is the sport of kings.

509
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,680
And as king, I say...
I get first pick!

510
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,200
- You think we'll get lucky?
- It won't be luck.

511
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:58,680
I've developed a formula
based on body structure.

512
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,400
- What's your name, boy?
- Gilbert, Gilbert, Gilbert!

513
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,880
He even talks fast! I, King Bob,

514
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,720
- select the Kindergartener...
- No!

515
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,720
Stop. We can't treat these
Kindergarteners like cattle.

516
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,360
- We did it last year.
- Well, it was wrong last year,

517
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,600
and the year before that,
and back when we were small.

518
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,680
We need to end this inhumane
charade once and for all.

519
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,200
Anyway, as I was saying,
I pick Gilbert.

520
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,840
- OK, rabble, pick your losers.
- (cheering)

521
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,120
- Look at those cheekbones.
- We'll take him.

522
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,720
Hey, Mikey, come on.
Don't walk away.

523
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,880
Sorry. I cannot be
a party to this injustice.

524
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,600
He's bugging about what happened
when he ran in the Derby.

525
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,680
- What did happen?
- We swore never to speak of it.

526
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,200
We double gramma swore.

527
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,480
- (sighs)
- Ooh!

528
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,480
What are you doing,
little fella?

529
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,320
- Tubby training.
- Poor kid. I know how it is.

530
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,120
They're making you run.

531
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,680
Tubby want run.
Tubby win big Derby.

532
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,040
You want to win so King Bob
will grant you your wish.

533
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,360
Tubby no care about wish. Tubby
run to show he good runner.

534
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,040
Who's your sponsor?
Swinger Girl? The Ashleys?

535
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,080
Tubby no have sponsor.
No-one pick Tubby.

536
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,040
A life without disappointment
is a life not lived.

537
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,800
- Who you pick, giant man?
- Me? No-one.

538
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,840
I refuse to participate in the
debasement of Kindergarteners.

539
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,000
Race not in basement.
Race upstairs in playground.

540
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,680
Uh... never mind.

541
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,320
You pick Tubby!
Tubby run for you.

542
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,440
Sorry but it wouldn't be right.

543
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,840
Wait! You help Tubby train.
You be Tubby's big brother.

544
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,360
Tubby no have big brother.

545
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,440
I've always wanted a brother.

546
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:45,040
- But no. It's not right.
- Pretty please, big giant boy.

547
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,120
All right,
you've got yourself a trainer.

548
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,000
When I say go...

549
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,440
- He's not coming back, is he?
- No, sire.

550
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,120
Remember, winning isn't
important. Just finish.

551
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,560
On your mark, get set, go.

552
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,640
I'm exhausted. Let's break
for a Winger Dinger.

553
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,880
No! Tubby want more train.

554
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,920
(puffs)

555
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,800
He's as determined
as he is doomed.

556
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,360
- OK. Let's see your stuff.
- Can't. My stuff in my cubby.

557
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,480
No, I mean... Just go.

558
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,720
Dudes!
The kid's got some wheels!

559
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,920
Don't thank me, although this is
evidence that my formula works.

560
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,880
(pants)

561
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,160
Ooh! Ladybug!

562
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,280
You and your lousy science.

563
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,160
(puffs)

564
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,120
Five minutes, 48 seconds.
Not bad at all.

565
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,640
Thanks. You think Tubby win?

566
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,160
Uh... Tubby finish.
How does that sound?

567
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,160
Five minutes, 45 seconds.
That's an improvement!

568
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,000
Isn't that wonderful, Tubby?

569
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,520
OK. Let's take five.

570
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,840
Tubby happy when he win big
race. Trophy look delicious.

571
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,960
Try not to think about winning.
Just concentrate on finishing.

572
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,040
No. Tubby really want to win.

573
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,480
Don't we all, Tubby.
Don't we all.

574
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,200
- Why Mikey sad?
- It's nothing.

575
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,720
I was just thinking
about something that happened.

576
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,440
Tell Tubby, big brother, then
Tubby be sad too, like Mikey.

577
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,040
Tubby, I told you,
I don't want to talk about it.

578
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,240
- Tell Tubby, please.
- (sighs)

579
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,520
Back when I was
a kindergartener, I... I...

580
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,800
I wasn't able
to finish the Derby, OK?

581
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,320
(gasps) Mikey no finish Derby?

582
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,640
I'm the only kid in the history
of Third Street who didn't.

583
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,360
That kid's so big
he can't even run!

584
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,040
He's not just fat,
he's pigeon-toed fat!

585
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,760
(all laugh)

586
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,440
I ran away. I just ran away.

587
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,080
Maybe big kids like us
weren't meant to run.

588
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,880
- Maybe we shouldn't even try.
- No! You wrong, giant boy!

589
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:06,320
We as good as anybody else. Me
run in race. Me finish for you.

590
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,160
Really? You'd do that for me?

591
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,440
That's what
a little brother's for.

592
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,400
No, Tubby!
Don't eat the wrapper!

593
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,880
OK. Stay loose. And remember,
visualise. Eye of the cheetah.

594
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,960
Hey, Mikey,
you picked a kid after all.

595
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:38,120
- Actually, he picked me.
- Come on. Race about to start.

596
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,960
Place your bets. Sorry, kid.
I don't take frozen desserts.

597
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,120
Hey, manzilla. Aren't you even
gonna, like, bet on your kid?

598
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,720
Actually, no. For, you see,
to us, winning is unimportant.

599
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,040
We run for the simple thrill
of competing,

600
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,560
the shared sense of unity
at the starting line,

601
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,160
the human potential expressed
in a thing as simple as a race.

602
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,880
Like bok-bok-bok, chicken!

603
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,320
Excuse me, Tubby. Wait here.

604
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,800
Hustler Kid,
I'd like to place a bet.

605
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,560
- Watcha got?
- A Winger Dinger.

606
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,760
Easy, big spender!
Don't break the bank!

607
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,600
Who can blame him for betting
small? His kid won't win.

608
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,920
He's husky. Pigeon-toed husky.

609
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:25,360
That's it! Here. I bet 37 Winger
Dinger's on my friend Tubby.

610
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,800
The 25th Annual Kindergarten
Derby is about to begin.

611
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,960
- Hustler Kid, close betting.
- (all) Oh!

612
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,920
- (growls)
- Hey, what's that kid wearing?

613
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,280
- None of your business.
- I hate those guys.

614
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,280
As always,
may the best little runt win.

615
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,520
- Sound Effects Boy?
- Ahem.

616
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,160
(gun firing noise)

617
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,880
(cheering)

618
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,840
- Run! Run!
- Faster! Faster!

619
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,880
Just finish!
Just finish! Just finish!

620
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,920
- This is terrible!
- Those laces cost a fortune!

621
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,840
- He's pulling away.
- Of course he's pulling away.

622
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,560
It's part of my strategy.

623
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,640
- She's falling behind.
- It's all part of my strategy.

624
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,360
Slow and steady,
slow and steady.

625
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,080
Slow and steady.

626
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,920
They're coming to Clown Slalom!

627
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,320
They're approaching
the Valley of Distraction.

628
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,880
It's done in more than
one promising Kindergartener.

629
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,880
That's why I put
the blinders on him.

630
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,760
You're a genius,
your majesty. A true genius.

631
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,920
Gilbert getting tired.
Gilbert getting tired.

632
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,040
Cyndi beat Gilbert. Cyndi beat
Gilbert. Cyndi beat Gilbert...

633
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,520
Ooh, shiny! I rich! I rich!

634
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,680
The Valley of Distraction
got Cyndi!

635
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,640
Well, there's always next year.

636
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,280
- Isn't that Mikey's kid?
- He's catching up on Gilbert!

637
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,600
You're kidding!

638
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,160
If your kid passes Gilbert

639
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,360
he might win the race!

640
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,720
Winning isn't important.
I just want Tubby to finish.

641
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,040
<i>(remembers) No, Tubby!</i>
<i>Don't eat the wrapper!</i>

642
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,120
No eat wrapper.
Tubby finish race.

643
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,800
(cheering)

644
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,960
Just finish, Tubby! Just finish!

645
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,920
- You dropped your betting slip.
- Let me see that.

646
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,400
He's got a 37 Winger-Dinger
ticket at 99-1!

647
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,240
It matters not. I only made this
bet to support my young charge.

648
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,960
That many Winger Dingers would
get you through high school!

649
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:51,160
Run, you little whomper!
Run to win! Win, win, win!

650
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,800
Giant boy say win, Tubby win.

651
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,480
- Whoa!
- Is that fat kid ours?

652
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,120
- No, we only own Gilbert.
- But the big one's catching up!

653
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,880
- Don't worry. Gilbert will win.
- You had better hope so.

654
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,120
- He's gonna do it!
- Run, Tubby, run!

655
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,640
Move it, you little brat,
or you're banished!

656
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,040
Wrong, brat! Wrong, brat!

657
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,920
You did it, Tubby! You didn't
only finish, you won! You won!

658
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,760
Tubby won it for giant kid. We
just as good. We just as good.

659
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,920
We uh... seem to have lost,
your highness.

660
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,720
I can see that! Well, might
as well get this over with.

661
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,960
Kids of the playground, I give
you the winner of the Derby.

662
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,440
- Tubby.
- (cheering)

663
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,240
By the power vested in me,
as set down in the constitution,

664
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,000
yadda, yadda, yadda,
I hereby grant you one wish.

665
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:59,520
Tubby wish... Tubby wish there
be no more Kindergarten Derby.

666
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,920
- (gasp)
- No more Kindergarten Derby?

667
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,840
But it's a playground tradition!

668
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,440
The tradition bad.
My big brother Mikey show me.

669
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,440
He act like Tubby is a person.

670
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,360
But all you other Big Kids
treat us like horses.

671
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,480
You make us run and
don't care what we want at all.

672
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,640
The bigger kids did it to us.

673
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,040
Just cos you treated bad,

674
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,560
don't mean you treat
little kids bad.

675
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,200
- That not make it right.
- Gee, I don't know.

676
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,600
All right, fine. The
Kindergarten Derby is no more.

677
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,160
(cheering)

678
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,320
So big brother Mikey.
Did Tubby do good?

679
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,400
No, little friend,
Tubby did great.

680
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,840
Now, Tubby,
I'm sure you remember that.

681
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,560
We formed a friendship
that will last forever.

682
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,560
Tubby? Tubby!

683
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,400
Tubby not know you.

684
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,520
But I thought
we would always be friends.

685
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,600
Don't take it personally.
He is your friend.

686
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,760
It's just dangerous
for him to admit it.

687
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,960
We tried sweet-talking them,
being their buddies. What else?

688
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,880
Chief Sticky is so oppressive

689
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,720
that he overpowers
their desire to help us.

690
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,080
There's gotta be some way
we can get out of this.

691
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,120
Woogablablabah!

692
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:19,280
Chief Stinky talk now. Me have
decided on Big Kid punishment.

693
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,120
Ooh!

694
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,160
Sorry, guys,
but there is no way out of this.

695
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,560
We're getting a boom-boom.

696
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,280
Feeling fresh
and fit as a fiddle.

697
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,240
- Hi, Gus. Where have you been?
- In the nurse's office.

698
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,920
Prickly's foot-care lecture
made me dizzy.

699
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,400
It made me
feel like throwing up.

700
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,680
Say, have you seen
TJ and the guys?

701
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,280
They went that way
with Mikey's new croquet set.

702
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,200
Thanks, Corn Chip Girl.

703
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,080
According to my trusty watch,

704
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,320
I have 45 minutes left
of good old recess fun.

705
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,800
Hey, guys. Guys?

706
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,040
I guess they're not back here.
But hey...

707
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,280
Mikey's croquet set.

708
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,280
Something bad happened here.
Something very bad.

709
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,360
Argh! Grr! Grr!

710
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,800
- Hey, little fella!
- Big Kid! Big Kid!

711
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,000
Get 'im!

712
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,160
- What are you going to do?
- We take you prisoner.

713
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,040
Big Kid step on
Kindergartener land.

714
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,440
But the Old Playground
is Big Kid land.

715
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:33,040
Don't waste your breath. They're
ignoring playground treaties.

716
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,160
- Quiet, Red Hat Boy.
- Red Hat Boy? But that's TJ!

717
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,840
You know TJ!

718
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,920
What's going on? I thought
the Kindergarteners liked us.

719
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,760
It's all different now.

720
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,840
They've become little monsters.

721
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,240
- Did they miss their nap?
- Worse. Much worse.

722
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,760
There's been a major upheaval
in their social order.

723
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,760
- Walalalalah!
- (gasps)

724
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,000
Me Big Chief Stinky.
Me in charge now. You be quiet.

725
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,000
(jabbers)

726
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,400
- Chief Stinky?
- He's new in school.

727
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,840
He intimidates the other tots
with his size and smell.

728
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,200
- Give me bug!
- My bug!

729
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:23,720
Give me bug! When me wake up,
Big Kids get punishment.

730
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,880
Mud pie massacre!

731
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,560
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

732
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,880
A mud pie massacre?
I hate mud pie massacres!

733
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,320
- We gotta talk them out of it.
- They ain't listening.

734
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,880
We reminded them about
when we were their Pee Wee Pals.

735
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
And the time TJ
hung out with them.

736
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,800
And the time
I helped young Tubby.

737
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,720
Stinky doesn't care about that
and he's in charge now.

738
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:49,160
- We're gonna get massacred.
- Big kids be quiet!

739
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:53,080
- Chief Stinky take his nap.
- Hector! Not you, too!

740
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,600
It's me! Your buddy, Safety Man!

741
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,600
You no Safety Man no more.
You bad Big Kid.

742
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:03,240
- And me Pyjama Boy.
- Your name is Hector!

743
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,640
Please stop, Safety Man!
Not make Chief Stinky mad!

744
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,080
If Stinky mad,
Stinky knock Hector down!

745
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,520
You guys aren't happy. Someone's
gotta stand up to him.

746
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,240
That not true! That wrong!

747
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,400
I've got a story
that might change your mind.

748
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,160
Me sick of stories
about how Big Kids nice to us.

749
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,040
My story's not about that.
It's not even about you.

750
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,400
It's about me
when I was a Kindergartener.

751
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,240
Oh! Kindergartener Safety Man?

752
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,160
That's right. It all happened
four long years ago.

753
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,400
My family had just moved and
I was starting at a new school.

754
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,080
Well, soldier, this will be your
first day at a new kindergarten.

755
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,440
- I hope you're not nervous.
- Me not nervous.

756
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,080
New Kid Gus make lots
and lots of friends. Grr!

757
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,080
- Go get 'em, trooper.
- That's our Gus.

758
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,880
Hey, Big Kids. Me like your
school. Me happy to be here.

759
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,320
- Heads up!
- Got it! Coming back atcha!

760
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,880
- Hey! Good throw!
- He's cute.

761
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,800
For a five-year-old,
he's pretty cool.

762
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,120
Surprisingly cool!

763
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,320
(bell rings)

764
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,480
Here we are.
Your new kindergarten room.

765
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,120
- Do you want us to walk you in?
- No, thanks.

766
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,840
- Me got it under control.
- That's the spirit.

767
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,000
- Gr! Ruff, ruff!
- I'll pick you up after class.

768
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,160
Gotcha.

769
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,960
Oo, oo, ee, ee!
Ooga, ooga, ooga!

770
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:29,200
Me Gus! Me new!
Kindergarten, kindergarten, yay!

771
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,760
- Uh... me got right room?
- Oh, you have the right room.

772
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:39,720
This is the Kindergarten class.
Welcome to Third Street School.

773
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:44,440
You're telling me that Finster
was our kindergarten teacher?

774
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,480
- And that she was nice?
- And you were cool?

775
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,320
Your tale seems
a little farfetched -

776
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,960
you didn't even move
to our school till this year.

777
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,960
Are you sure? How many of you
remember kindergarten?

778
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,480
What Big Kid wants to remember
that he was... a Kindergartener?

779
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,880
I permanently erased it
from my brain.

780
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,880
All I remember
is the Kindergarten Derby.

781
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,120
That's what I thought.

782
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,800
I moved here for a while
in kindergarten.

783
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,320
- But Gus...
- Hey! Big Kids stop gabbing!

784
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,960
Tell more story. Hector
wondering what happened next.

785
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:24,480
Very well. It was my first day
at Third Street School.

786
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,080
Things were a little different
back then,

787
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,800
but not just with Miss Finster
and not just with me,

788
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,080
but with these guys, too.

789
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,760
"And little Geoffrey remembered
to thank Great Aunt Agnes

790
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,920
for the brand new
velvet play suit.

791
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,920
He sat quietly and ate
all of his kidney pie,

792
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,600
and he cleaned his room
extra thoroughly

793
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,240
in hopes that his next birthday
would be as special as this."

794
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,760
The end.
Ah, wasn't that a fun story?

795
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:55,160
- Now it's time for a snack.
- Yay! Woowoowoo!

796
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,440
Snack, snack, snack! Juice!

797
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,720
Your last kindergarten failed
to teach classroom etiquette.

798
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,040
That's all right. You'll learn.
Line up with your classmates.

799
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,120
(whistle) Single file, children.

800
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,160
- Yes, Miss Finster.
- One snack a piece.

801
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,760
Take them outside.
Be sure to use a napkin.

802
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:24,320
Chew your snacks thoroughly
and dispose of your trash.

803
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,440
Don't worry. You'll fit in just
like all the other children.

804
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,480
Boy, I sure hope not.

805
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,720
Hi, kid. My name's Gus.
What's your name?

806
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,720
Ooh!

807
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,640
OK.

808
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,640
- Morning, girlies...
- Like, uh...

809
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,600
Hm. Very strange.

810
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,840
(doll) Feed me!

811
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,560
Very more stranger indeed.

812
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:04,160
Hi, Red Hat Boy. I'm Gus.
What's your name?

813
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,680
Uh... Theodore Jasper Detweiler.

814
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,760
Theodore Jasper?
I'll call you TJ.

815
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,080
TJ sounds more neater. And it's
two of the letters that I know.

816
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,080
TJ... Hey, I think I like that.

817
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,480
Nifty. Anyway, TJ,
I've got a question for you.

818
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:23,400
How come nobody in this class
acts like Kindergarteners?

819
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,040
You know...
Gr! Ooh! Me crazy! Yah!

820
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,240
- Please don't!
- It just don't make no sense!

821
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:34,240
I've been in three
kindergartens already.

822
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:38,800
I've never seen nothing
like this. Kids are scared.

823
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,080
What are you scared of?
Miss Finster?

824
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,880
Miss Finster likes quiet,
but that's not why we are.

825
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,840
- How come, then?
- Grr!

826
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,000
- It's Mikey! Run for your life!
- Run for my life?

827
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,520
That's crazy! Hi there, Mikey.
My name is Gus.

828
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,280
- I just moved...
- You give Mikey snack!

829
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,160
Ow!

830
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,640
Hee, hee, hee.
Well done, Chief Mikey.

831
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,440
Now back to the palace.

832
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,840
- In you go, your highness.
- Grr!

833
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,920
Hey! Big boy!
You cannot take my snack! Hey!

834
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,520
Gus, you don't want to
tangle with Chief Mikey!

835
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,800
That's right. Behave yourself.

836
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,160
- Who are you?
- I am Wandall.

837
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,480
- Wandall?
- Not Wandall. Wandall.

838
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,080
Randall helps protect us from
Chief Mikey. Chief Mikey's mean.

839
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,840
- He sure is.
- Tell him about what you heard.

840
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,000
One time Chief Mikey sat on
a toddler, just for kicks!

841
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,480
Sat on a toddler!
That's just plan evil!

842
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:43,000
Yes, it is. Lucky for you,
I'm here to watch out for you.

843
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,600
Chief Mikey make me drive
his tricycle, guard his palace,

844
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,240
but I can keep him
from sitting on you.

845
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,520
Remember, Chief Mikey is
a dangerous, dangerous meanie.

846
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,680
But I can keep you safe. Do what
I say and everything will be OK.

847
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,680
Randall, you're the bestest
friend a kid could have.

848
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,680
I know. Now scat, all of you,
and behave yourselves.

849
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,000
If you don't, Chief Mikey will
pull your hair and kick you.

850
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:10,720
Keep quiet. I'll convince Chief
Mikey not to rip you to pieces.

851
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,000
Thanks, Randall. Come on, Gus.
Let's find a place to be quiet.

852
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,680
- Hang on there, TJ.
- Mikey will hear us!

853
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:20,320
- He'll smush us! Come on!
- No!

854
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:24,160
- What are you saying, Gus?
- Maybe I will get sitted on,

855
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,040
but kindergarten's supposed to
be a place where you get messy

856
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,920
and act like animals.

857
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,360
Growl! Oo, oo, aa, aa, aa!

858
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,920
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

859
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,920
This is the very last chance
we get to be like that!

860
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,880
There's no way I'm letting some
mean kid take that away from me.

861
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,800
I'm gonna tell Chief Mikey I'm
not putting up with meanness,

862
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:48,440
even if I do get sitted on.
Who's going with me?

863
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:51,720
- No.
- I don't know...

864
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:56,600
TJ? All right,
then I'll do it all on myself.

865
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,720
- Open up the door right now!
- Gr! You better go away!

866
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,920
Grr!

867
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,600
I'm telling you, Mikey,
those kids hate you.

868
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,920
They talk about
how big and fat you are.

869
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,840
(whimpers)

870
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,320
It's a good thing you've got me
or they'd get away with it.

871
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,800
You mind passing
one of those juice boxes?

872
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,800
(slurps) Aah.

873
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,400
Now it all makes sense. And
there's only one thing to do.

874
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,480
I'm going in.

875
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:33,080
That there is the most bravest
thing I ever seen anyone do.

876
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,840
- Ow! Ow!
- Mikey sat on New Boy's head!

877
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:40,000
Oh, no, he didn't.
Mikey wouldn't sit on no-one.

878
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,280
- Hey, Mikey, come on out.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow!

879
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:46,440
You can stop saying "ow".
Mikey's not even hurting you.

880
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,840
What are you talking about? He
sure was! Cos he's big and mean!

881
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,160
You all saw him steal
the New Boy's snack!

882
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:55,240
And yesterday before last
he took my jump rope!

883
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:58,160
He once kicked my pile of rocks.

884
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,360
So what do you say about that?

885
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:08,400
What do I say? I say it was
all a terrible misunderstanding.

886
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,600
Hey! Mikey gave me
a piggyback ride!

887
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,760
Enjoy, my little friend.

888
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,920
Randall told me you all made fun
of me, that you hated me.

889
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,840
That hurt my feelings
and made me very angry.

890
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,160
Hey, where did you get
the fancy voice?

891
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:26,920
This is my normal voice. Randall
told me to use that mean voice.

892
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,960
You really should
admit the truth, Randall.

893
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:33,320
- It'll make you feel better.
- Oh, all right. I did it.

894
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,040
I just had to convince Mikey
everyone was afraid of him,

895
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,960
that I was his only friend.

896
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,280
Snacks, lunches, power -
it could have all been mine.

897
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:45,720
I could have been king! I would
have ruled the playground!

898
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:50,360
Ha, ha, ha, ha! Ha... Oh.
If my plan had only succeeded.

899
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:53,520
You've been
a very naughty little boy.

900
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,120
But I forgive you.

901
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,400
You don't gotta be
scared of Mikey no more.

902
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,680
Let's have
some kindergarten fun!

903
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,800
Yippee!

904
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,120
Me swing! Me swing!

905
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,920
Me go upsy-daisy down!

906
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,800
Pinned ya!
Hey, I'm pretty tough.

907
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,440
Yes, you are, Spinelli.
But I think I smashed your doll.

908
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,120
Mama! Feed me! I'm hungry!

909
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,440
Eugh. Feed yourself, girlie.
I'm fightin'.

910
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,600
All right.
Who else wants a piece of me?

911
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,640
Mud, when mixed with compounds
of different viscosities,

912
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,640
such as this peanut butter
and this jelly,

913
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,800
makes a truly superior goo.

914
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:04,200
(gasp) Scandalous!

915
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,760
You see, TJ? That's the way a
kindergarten oughta should be.

916
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:11,280
Are you crazy? This is bad.
This is very, very bad!

917
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,280
I'm telling!
Miss Finster! Miss Finster!

918
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,040
- Miss Finster, quick!
- What is it, Randall?

919
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:21,600
- The kids are out of control!
- My stars!

920
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,560
Children! Children!
Stop it this instant!

921
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,120
Remember your manners.
You must be quiet.

922
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,720
You must remain clean.
You must...

923
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,520
- Uh-oh.
- Why... Why...

924
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,560
But how... Who...

925
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,040
It was the new boy,
Miss Finster!

926
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,680
This all happened
because of him.

927
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,640
Oh, the new boy, you say.

928
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,240
Yes, ma'am.
He's been a very bad influence.

929
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,680
I never realised what
a helpful little boy you were.

930
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:52,560
Griswold, I knew from the moment
I saw you that you were trouble.

931
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:56,000
I tried being nice to you,
I tried being nice to you all,

932
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,000
but I see that approach
doesn't work.

933
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,000
So Griswold,
you're coming with me.

934
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,040
- Where to, ma'am?
- To the principal's office.

935
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,800
- (murmuring)
- That's right, children.

936
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,200
When you don't sit quietly
and do nothing,

937
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,360
bad things happen.

938
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,920
Randall, keep an eye on these...
these... miscreants.

939
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,440
- With pleasure.
- You watch what happens to Gus

940
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:21,840
and you'll change your tune.
If I have anything to say,

941
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,680
Kindergarteners at this school

942
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,480
will never act
like savages again.

943
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:32,480
You heard. I'm in charge here.
Behave and keep it quiet.

944
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,560
Woe is me!
Our new friend Gus is doomed!

945
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,960
Well, Gus didn't give up on us,
so I'm not giving up on him.

946
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:43,760
I've found out what it's like
to be a real Kindergartener,

947
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,960
and I like it.

948
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,480
If it wasn't for Gus, we'd
all still be scared of Mikey.

949
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,640
We'd be quiet and polite,
and that's just wrong.

950
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,560
New Boy Gus was willing to get
himself in trouble for us.

951
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:01,960
I think I'd be a crumby boy if I
didn't do just as much for him.

952
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,520
- Who's gonna help me?
- I will.

953
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,680
- I will.
- Count me in.

954
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,080
Include me as well.

955
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,920
- Tender.
- Hey, I'm in charge here!

956
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,880
- You in big, big trouble.
- Like, no, you don't.

957
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,400
Come on, everybody.
We lock him in the palace.

958
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,480
Argh!

959
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,960
- What now, Theodore?
- It's TJ, Vince.

960
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:25,360
And listen up.
Cos guys, I got a plan.

961
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:34,800
Just like I figured.
The Big Kids are all in class.

962
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,960
We'll slip in undefected.

963
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,320
- Is this Prickly's office?
- Gretchen?

964
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,200
Allow me to verify.

965
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:53,400
When Prickly gets here I'll see
we make an example of that boy.

966
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,960
Egad! Oh, one office over.

967
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:04,000
Bingo. He's all alone in there,
awaiting his fate.

968
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:07,320
- All right. Phase two. Vince?
- I got it, Teej.

969
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:13,280
- Mikey? Spinelli?
- Willing and able, TJ.

970
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,760
- Hey, are you OK?
- Whoa, I really am tough.

971
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,360
- What are you doing here?
- I'm bustin' you out.

972
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,800
- Principal, there you are.
- What's going on, Miss Finster?

973
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,120
- This better be important.
- I can't leave!

974
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,440
They're gonna expect me
to be sitting in that chair.

975
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:33,600
Don't you worry. There will be
someone sitting in that chair.

976
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:37,000
I'm telling you, sir, my entire
class is acting like savages.

977
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,960
It's all because of that sneaky
little hoodlum, Gus Griswold.

978
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,160
The new boy?
But that's impossible.

979
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,360
You have the most
well-mannered class ever.

980
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,640
One little child
couldn't change them.

981
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,920
Oh, just you wait
till you see him, sir.

982
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,560
Right here, sir. A sneaky,
brilliant junior criminal.

983
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:57,680
- What the...
- Mama, I made a mess.

984
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,880
Please change me.

985
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,640
Griswold!

986
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,600
You regalise we're all gonna
get in trouble for this.

987
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:09,200
That's OK, Gus. It's worth it.

988
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,160
I just made the best bunch of
friends a kid could ever have.

989
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,320
- You said it!
- And the rest is history.

990
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,240
I moved away again the next day,

991
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:20,480
but me and TJ and the guys did
become the best friends ever.

992
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:24,640
That beautiful story,
Safety Man.

993
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,800
Makes Hector happy.
Hector like to be happy.

994
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,480
But you can't be all that happy,
Hector. Not living like this.

995
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:36,480
It seems to me if anyone's
prisoners here, it's you guys.

996
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,640
Safety Man make good point.

997
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,840
So I say forget about
helping us Big Kids.

998
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:44,200
After we get massacred
we can wash up and leave.

999
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,880
But this is their kindergarten.
This is your home.

1000
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,280
And those are your friends.
You've got to stand up for them.

1001
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:54,560
- And stand up for yourself.
- You're right, Safety Man.

1002
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,920
Tubby! Cyndi! Captain Sticky!
Hector love you!

1003
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,200
- Hector make you happy again!
- Who wake up Chief Stinky?

1004
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,080
(all) Oh, no!

1005
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:06,200
You, Pyjama Boy!
You wake up Chief Stinky!

1006
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,360
Chief Stinky knock you over!

1007
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,200
(whimpers)

1008
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:18,920
Waah! I scraped knee!

1009
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,200
Teacher, teacher! Stinky need
kiss kiss on boom-boom! Waah!

1010
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,160
Hey! Stinky not so tough!

1011
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,920
- We're not scared no more!
- Yay!

1012
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,080
Hector new chief!

1013
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:35,160
Hector say let Big Kids go!

1014
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,600
- I'm free!
- Thanks, Hector!

1015
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:45,000
Hector thank Safety Man.
We be happy. We have fun.

1016
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:49,480
- We free!
- (laughter)

1017
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:53,160
Well, there they are, wild,
crazy and back to normal.

1018
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:56,000
- It's perfectly terrifying.
- That's what I say.

1019
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,200
Let's get out of here.

1020
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,400
Gus, that was some
quick thinking in there.

1021
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,800
- You faked 'em out, man!
- What an imagination!

1022
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:11,520
- Me scared of Mikey?
- And me a frightening ogre?

1023
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:15,040
Like I could have been some
wimpy guy who wasn't the leader!

1024
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:20,080
Now I know you made
that story up! You're so funny!

1025
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,880
- Great story.
- Uh... of course, guys.

1026
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,560
- I made the whole thing up.
- Well, duh!

1027
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,120
There's still a little recess
left. Let's have some fun.

1028
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,600
Perhaps we can still salvage
my croquet set.

1029
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,640
(all talk at once)

1030
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:43,280
Miss Finster. There go TJ and
the gang. Shall I spy on them?

1031
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:48,840
Yes. And keep an extra close eye
on Griswold, will you?

1032
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:52,880
- Uh... yes, ma'am.
- Some day, Griswold.

1033
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,560
Some day you'll slip up
and I'll get even.

1034
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:58,640
Oh, yes. I'll get even.
