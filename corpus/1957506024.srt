1
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,752
Vinnie, you promised.

2
00:01:40,883 --> 00:01:42,232
Just trying to make it
through the day, baby.

3
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:47,193
Where did you get that?

4
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:48,281
Don't worry about it.

5
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:50,545
Don't worry about it?

6
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:53,983
That's all I do
is worry about it.

7
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,550
I mean, do you think
they're just going to keep

8
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,725
fronting you without payment?

9
00:01:56,855 --> 00:01:57,754
It's cool.

10
00:01:57,769 --> 00:01:59,641
My credit's good.

11
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:03,297
Oh, oh, and that's supposed
to make me feel better, huh?

12
00:02:03,427 --> 00:02:05,342
I mean this shit will kill you!

13
00:02:05,473 --> 00:02:06,473
You crazy?

14
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:10,739
That's $200 worth you
just threw on the floor.

15
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:13,045
Why should I
worry about it, huh?

16
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:14,119
Your credit's good.

17
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:14,989
Yeah, go on.

18
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:18,399
Get up there.

19
00:02:18,529 --> 00:02:19,529
Stay outa my face!

20
00:03:21,157 --> 00:03:22,463
How you doing?

21
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:27,642
I missed you yesterday.

22
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:29,209
Yeah.

23
00:03:29,339 --> 00:03:30,340
I'm real sorry about that
but I was just getting

24
00:03:30,471 --> 00:03:31,907
ready to come by and see you.

25
00:03:32,037 --> 00:03:35,302
I guess I saved you a trip.

26
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:36,912
According to my
calculations, we seem to be

27
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:38,870
missing a kilo of cocaine.

28
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:40,698
Now, how do you suppose
that bag got away?

29
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:43,179
Huh?
Any ideas?

30
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,225
I don't know, But.
I swear to God.

31
00:03:45,355 --> 00:03:46,748
Perhaps I can
refresh your memory.

32
00:03:47,923 --> 00:03:48,778
Wait.

33
00:03:48,793 --> 00:03:49,692
Wait.

34
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:50,926
Don't.

35
00:03:51,056 --> 00:03:52,232
I took it.

36
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:54,190
I'm sorry, man.
I swear on my father.

37
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:55,844
I was just going to come
by and pay you for it.

38
00:03:55,974 --> 00:03:57,672
So where's my money?

39
00:03:57,802 --> 00:03:59,282
Well, that's what I was going
to come and talk to you about.

40
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:01,632
Oh, Vinnie, Vinnie, Vinnie.

41
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:02,662
No, no, no.

42
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:03,982
I can get it.

43
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:05,549
I just got to make some
collections, you know?

44
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,378
It's like singing the
same old song on the charts.

45
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:10,859
Going all the way up to
number one with a bullet.

46
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:11,989
No, Blade. please.

47
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:16,589
Go ahead.

48
00:04:16,604 --> 00:04:17,692
Take it.

49
00:04:17,822 --> 00:04:19,607
It's worth way more
than I owe you.

50
00:04:19,737 --> 00:04:22,087
A lucky horseshoe, Ray.

51
00:04:22,218 --> 00:04:23,524
Please.

52
00:04:23,654 --> 00:04:26,222
Vinnie, I'm touched.

53
00:04:26,353 --> 00:04:28,006
Chico, am I a pawnbroker?

54
00:04:28,137 --> 00:04:29,137
No.

55
00:04:29,181 --> 00:04:30,270
Do I look like a pawnbroker?

56
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,400
No.

57
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:32,794
Do I look like a pawnbroker?

58
00:04:32,924 --> 00:04:35,144
I am not a pawnbroker.

59
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,711
And you know what?

60
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:39,235
It's only lucky, if you
were on the right side.

61
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:43,892
You had it upside down
and that's bad luck.

62
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:48,678
Get her.

63
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:02,389
Now, you see, Vinnie?

64
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,738
That's the way you're
supposed to wear it.

65
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:09,816
That's good luck.

66
00:05:09,831 --> 00:05:10,831
See it?

67
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:21,625
Ah, perfect fit.

68
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:27,447
I'm not interested.

69
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:28,476
Yeah.

70
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:29,666
I know what I said.

71
00:07:29,797 --> 00:07:31,712
But I changed my mind.

72
00:07:31,842 --> 00:07:33,104
Look, I don't want it.
All right?

73
00:07:33,235 --> 00:07:34,584
And do me a favor, huh?

74
00:07:34,715 --> 00:07:37,457
Why don't you just stop
calling me, all Right

75
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:40,155
Hey, Mario, you having
ex-girlfriend problems?

76
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:41,184
No, no.

77
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,199
Long distance carrier.

78
00:07:46,422 --> 00:07:47,422
Shit.

79
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,439
Got some new
talent, hey, Mario?

80
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,224
Business must be good.

81
00:08:06,355 --> 00:08:07,748
Look I told your boy.

82
00:08:07,878 --> 00:08:09,401
I can't be paying you
protection money no more.

83
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:10,475
You get my message?

84
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,491
Yeah.

85
00:08:11,621 --> 00:08:12,621
I got the message.

86
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:14,276
That's what I'm doing here.

87
00:08:14,406 --> 00:08:15,451
Show you what might
happen in case

88
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:16,670
you don't make my payments.

89
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
Boys.

90
00:08:20,412 --> 00:08:22,197
Hey, what are you doing?

91
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:23,226
Get outa here.

92
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:25,026
Guys go.

93
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:26,099
Cut it out.

94
00:08:26,114 --> 00:08:27,768
Tell them to cut it out.

95
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:29,160
Maybe this will
show you the value

96
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,422
of a good protection agency.

97
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:38,039
Hey, cut it out.

98
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:39,169
Ho.

99
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:44,611
What say you come
down here, cowgirl?

100
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:46,700
Ride my fucking bronco?

101
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:49,876
Oh.

102
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:54,098
Hey, Mario, what's happening?

103
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,871
Wow.

104
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:29,002
Nobody move.

105
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:33,442
What took you so long?

106
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,400
You know me, I have
to have my coffee.

107
00:09:39,404 --> 00:09:41,276
Officer Palermo, I
got one thing to say,

108
00:09:41,406 --> 00:09:42,712
thank you very much.

109
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:44,496
Oh, no, don't mention it.

110
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:46,237
You think later
on you and I could

111
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:48,979
catch a cup of coffee, huh?

112
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,982
You know, I still
have a few bullets left.

113
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:56,581
Coffee?

114
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,424
Coffee?

115
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:00,497
I wasn't needed.

116
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:01,905
I wasn't needed.

117
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:03,341
I wasn't needed here.

118
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:11,435
Woo, hoo!

119
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:26,364
Well, if it isn't
the queen of the rodeo.

120
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:27,975
Oh, back off, Fredericks.

121
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:29,716
Well, how would you like
to come back to my office

122
00:10:29,846 --> 00:10:32,719
and let me shoot you
with my love gun, honey.

123
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:33,981
Thanks, but you know what?

124
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,853
I heard that you
might be low on ammo.

125
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:37,883
That's pretty funny.

126
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:38,753
All right.

127
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:39,768
OK, look.

128
00:10:39,813 --> 00:10:41,249
The captain wants to see you.

129
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:42,598
Great.

130
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:43,904
Do you mind covering
while I go change?

131
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:45,340
Sure.

132
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,124
But you might want to
keep that outfit on,

133
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:48,256
especially if he brings up that
raise you've been asking for.

134
00:10:48,386 --> 00:10:49,387
That's not even funny.

135
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:50,373
It's not funny.

136
00:10:50,388 --> 00:10:51,868
It's just a thought.

137
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:53,957
Listen, you're gonna go
and you're gonna wear this.

138
00:10:54,088 --> 00:10:56,351
What the hell's going on?

139
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:57,657
Sir.

140
00:10:57,787 --> 00:11:01,225
Palermo, what is
with that get up?

141
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:04,272
It's the undercover
bust at Wiggles, sir.

142
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:05,926
Oh, yeah, congratulations.

143
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:07,056
Thanks.

144
00:11:07,144 --> 00:11:08,130
Need to see you in my office.

145
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:09,145
Yes, sir.

146
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:11,453
May I please go change first?

147
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,281
Yeah, go ahead.

148
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:14,412
Oh, and Palermo.

149
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:15,805
Yes, sir?

150
00:11:15,936 --> 00:11:18,242
Y'all hurry back to
my office now, pardner.

151
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Hey, Stace.

152
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,386
Got the word you
had a tough day.

153
00:11:31,516 --> 00:11:32,604
You kidding me?

154
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,997
I danced for less
than 30 minutes.

155
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:35,216
Made over $100.

156
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:36,346
You're joking.

157
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:37,653
What's the name of this dive?

158
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:39,133
Maybe I should do a
little moonlighting.

159
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:40,525
Now you would make a fortune.

160
00:11:40,656 --> 00:11:42,745
Unfortunately, it's
all in very sweaty ones.

161
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:43,731
Ick.

162
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:44,878
Got the picture.

163
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:46,227
You splitting that with Zig?

164
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:47,357
No way.

165
00:11:47,402 --> 00:11:48,969
It was my butt on the line.

166
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:50,840
He didn't even show up until
after everything went down.

167
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:52,712
Zig knew you could
handle it, that's all.

168
00:11:52,842 --> 00:11:54,452
Besides, I heard
he told Dietrich

169
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,542
that he was going to stand
by outside to cover you.

170
00:11:57,673 --> 00:11:58,979
Really?

171
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:00,850
He didn't want to
embarrass you, that's all.

172
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:02,330
How long you
guys been partners?

173
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,592
A little over two years.

174
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,289
And in all that
time he never...

175
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,161
No, no, no, no.

176
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,119
Not that he didn't
try anything, but no.

177
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,817
So what's the problem?

178
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:12,557
He's kind of cute, earns a
decent pay, and he's straight.

179
00:12:12,688 --> 00:12:14,385
What could possibly go wrong?

180
00:12:14,516 --> 00:12:15,822
Plenty.

181
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:17,171
If it doesn't
work out, you just

182
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:19,608
get the captain to
reassign him to Vice

183
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,393
and I'll take good care of him.

184
00:12:22,524 --> 00:12:23,786
Jody.

185
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:26,354
You are something else.

186
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:28,356
Believe me, I know
what I'm talking about.

187
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:38,887
I had nothing to do with that.

188
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:39,918
Yeah, right.

189
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:41,456
Come on, I'm your partner.

190
00:12:41,586 --> 00:12:42,718
All right.
All right.

191
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:43,937
I'll make it up to you.

192
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:46,635
Dinner on me tonight at Zord's.

193
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,766
You're on.

194
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,203
I am?

195
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:52,206
Yeah, you are.

196
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:54,338
Hey, Stace.

197
00:12:54,469 --> 00:12:57,472
You really do have
a nice pair of legs.

198
00:12:57,602 --> 00:12:58,865
What's that?

199
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:00,214
About the size of yours.

200
00:13:00,344 --> 00:13:01,344
Real nice.

201
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:06,481
That'll be all.

202
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:08,700
Right, Captain.

203
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:11,965
Detective Palermo,
this is Lisa Wilkes.

204
00:13:12,095 --> 00:13:15,011
Stacey, call me Stacey.

205
00:13:15,142 --> 00:13:17,013
Ms. Wilkes arrived
home from work

206
00:13:17,144 --> 00:13:19,494
this afternoon to find out her
boyfriend had been murdered.

207
00:13:19,624 --> 00:13:20,974
Oh, I'm sorry.

208
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:22,149
She walked all the way
here because her phone

209
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,890
has been disconnected.

210
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,457
Look, I think
homicide;s about done.

211
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:29,330
I was hoping maybe you
could take her home.

212
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,359
Sure, sure.

213
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:31,273
That's not a problem.

214
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:32,288
Do you want to go?

215
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:37,773
OK, yeah.

216
00:13:37,904 --> 00:13:40,167
OK, I'll be out
in a minute then.

217
00:13:40,297 --> 00:13:41,297
Thanks.

218
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:46,347
Why do you want me
to do the babysitting?

219
00:13:46,477 --> 00:13:48,915
I've got a ton of
paperwork to do.

220
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:51,569
Cause I think you
can get her to open up.

221
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,007
She knows more than
she's letting on,

222
00:13:54,137 --> 00:13:56,923
and I hate to admit
it, you're probably

223
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:59,577
the best damn detective
this precinct has.

224
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,753
I do believe that was
a compliment, Captain.

225
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:02,783
Yeah.

226
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:04,104
Yeah.

227
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:06,454
You know, if it wasn't
for that god awful tie,

228
00:14:06,584 --> 00:14:07,584
you wouldn't be half bad.

229
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:10,936
I love this tie.

230
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:19,293
Lisa, let's get going.

231
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:20,642
Stace, what's up?

232
00:14:20,772 --> 00:14:21,991
Ziggy.

233
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:23,732
Oh, god, could you
book those boys for me?

234
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,038
I have to run an errand.

235
00:14:25,168 --> 00:14:26,387
Sure.

236
00:14:26,517 --> 00:14:27,373
What about dinner?

237
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:29,564
Oh, god.

238
00:14:29,694 --> 00:14:31,044
I'll call you.

239
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:32,174
Sorry.

240
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,854
They're here.

241
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:15,088
No sweat.

242
00:15:15,218 --> 00:15:17,525
Norris and Bach
are on their way.

243
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:31,408
Don't you have a
sheet or something

244
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:32,539
you can cover him up with?

245
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:37,458
They took his ring.

246
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:41,027
The bastard shot him and
they took his ring anyway.

247
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:45,379
It's only thing that ever
meant anything to him.

248
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:48,382
Oh, my god.

249
00:15:48,512 --> 00:15:50,166
- Oh, no.
- What?

250
00:15:50,297 --> 00:15:51,297
What is it?

251
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:52,864
It's a death notice for me.

252
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,040
No, it's not for you.

253
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,476
Look, they do that
to scare people.

254
00:15:55,606 --> 00:15:57,565
I got to get out of here.
I can't stay here.

255
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,914
OK.

256
00:15:59,045 --> 00:15:59,856
Do you have anybody
you can stay with?

257
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:00,871
No.
I don't know.

258
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,265
Can't we just get out of here?

259
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,630
Lisa.

260
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:26,231
That's them.

261
00:16:26,246 --> 00:16:27,246
Take them out.

262
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:03,196
You all right?

263
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:04,936
You want to go somewhere,
stop somewhere?

264
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:07,635
No.

265
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:08,751
Look, it's OK.

266
00:17:08,766 --> 00:17:10,072
Nobody's going to hurt you.

267
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:11,595
Get real.

268
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:13,423
Give you my word on that.

269
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:17,166
That's supposed to
make me feel better.

270
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:18,385
I know what you're
going through.

271
00:17:18,515 --> 00:17:21,214
You don't know shit.

272
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:22,867
You're just a damn cop.

273
00:17:22,998 --> 00:17:27,655
There is a huge difference
between your world and mine.

274
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:29,265
You only write the reports.

275
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:30,658
I live them.

276
00:17:30,788 --> 00:17:34,531
But you wouldn't know
anything about that.

277
00:17:34,662 --> 00:17:36,794
Yeah, I guess you're right.

278
00:17:36,925 --> 00:17:38,013
See that?

279
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:40,798
I wouldn't know
anything about that.

280
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:44,715
That was because I didn't
have dinner ready on time.

281
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:47,196
I've been there, Lisa.

282
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:49,155
I'm sorry.

283
00:17:49,285 --> 00:17:50,895
Isn't there anywhere
I can take you?

284
00:17:51,026 --> 00:17:52,462
No, not really.

285
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:53,855
A relative?

286
00:17:56,858 --> 00:17:58,860
My folks live in Pennsylvania
and I haven't spoken to them

287
00:17:58,990 --> 00:17:59,990
in years.

288
00:18:00,035 --> 00:18:03,169
So you don't have any friends?

289
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:04,822
No.

290
00:18:04,953 --> 00:18:07,477
My friends won't
even talk to me.

291
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:09,436
Vinny was real trouble.

292
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:12,221
It wasn't his fault. It
was just his habit and all.

293
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:13,962
It must've been tough.

294
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:19,489
I stood by his side and you
gotta give me credit for that.

295
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,620
I loved him.

296
00:18:23,363 --> 00:18:24,262
God.

297
00:18:24,277 --> 00:18:25,887
God dammit!

298
00:18:26,017 --> 00:18:29,064
And those bastards just killed
him like he was some animal.

299
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:31,458
It's all right.
Just let it out.

300
00:18:31,588 --> 00:18:32,588
Oh, god.

301
00:18:35,897 --> 00:18:37,855
Lisa, get down.

302
00:18:37,986 --> 00:18:38,986
Get down!

303
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:02,401
Stay down!

304
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:22,899
Stacy!

305
00:19:52,756 --> 00:19:54,062
You all right?

306
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,543
No, I'm not all right.

307
00:19:56,673 --> 00:19:58,675
They just tried to kill me and
you know they'll try again.

308
00:19:58,806 --> 00:19:59,748
Come on.

309
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:00,763
Where are we going?

310
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:01,896
Someplace where
you'll be safe.

311
00:20:02,026 --> 00:20:03,026
Come on, let's go!

312
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:36,713
This better to be good.

313
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:38,149
Captain?

314
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,412
Nichols, I told you
never to use his phone

315
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:41,109
unless it's an emergency.

316
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,676
Sorry, Captain, I
tried normal channels,

317
00:20:42,806 --> 00:20:44,068
but I couldn't get through.

318
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:45,199
I thought you'd like
to know what happened.

319
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:46,593
Oh, let me guess.

320
00:20:46,723 --> 00:20:48,377
You're putting in
for early retirement.

321
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:49,900
No, but Palermo might be.

322
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:51,598
Why so?

323
00:20:51,728 --> 00:20:54,296
Two punks took a dry dive
off the Fifth Street Bridge.

324
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:56,907
Seems they were chased
through downtown by Palermo,

325
00:20:57,038 --> 00:20:58,082
shots were fired.

326
00:20:58,213 --> 00:20:59,388
Let me speak to her.

327
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,607
No can do.

328
00:21:00,737 --> 00:21:02,130
According to
witnesses, she took off

329
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,958
in that clunker of hers
right after the accident.

330
00:21:04,088 --> 00:21:06,047
Classic.

331
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:09,006
Nothing, she calls that
old heap of junk a classic.

332
00:21:09,137 --> 00:21:11,182
Belonged to her old man
before he left the force.

333
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:13,533
Listen, where the
hell is she at?

334
00:21:13,663 --> 00:21:15,099
Probably in hiding.

335
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,710
Word on the street is
there's a big payday waiting

336
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,059
for anybody who
can put the finger

337
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:19,669
on Vinnie Mateo's girlfriend.

338
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,105
All right, Nichols,
stay on it, will you?

339
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:22,236
- You bet.
- Thanks.

340
00:21:58,578 --> 00:21:59,927
Food here is pretty bad.

341
00:22:00,057 --> 00:22:01,972
But you'll feel a lot
safer, believe me.

342
00:22:07,543 --> 00:22:08,936
Yes, Rita.

343
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:10,677
Well, I hate to
bring everyone down,

344
00:22:10,807 --> 00:22:13,114
but I talked to my psychic
pal last night and...

345
00:22:13,244 --> 00:22:14,289
Oh, brother, here we go.

346
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,420
Quiet, Tony.

347
00:22:15,464 --> 00:22:16,363
Hey, hey, hey, that's enough.

348
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:17,466
Just let her talk.

349
00:22:17,597 --> 00:22:19,033
Go ahead, Rita.

350
00:22:19,163 --> 00:22:20,904
Anyway, she said something
bad was going to happen

351
00:22:21,035 --> 00:22:22,645
in the next couple of days.

352
00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:24,908
Yeah, you're going
to get your phone bill.

353
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,693
I can't believe you
actually fall for that shit.

354
00:22:26,823 --> 00:22:27,823
You're so gullible.

355
00:22:28,825 --> 00:22:30,392
Don't even go there.

356
00:22:30,523 --> 00:22:32,046
At least I'm not sitting around
waiting for collect calls

357
00:22:32,176 --> 00:22:33,961
from my jailed boyfriend.

358
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:35,789
Are you due for
a tranquilizer?

359
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,181
Oh, cat fight, cat fight.

360
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,211
Uh, oh.

361
00:22:38,226 --> 00:22:39,488
Anybody home?

362
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:41,577
Stacey.

363
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:42,796
Hey, sis.

364
00:22:42,926 --> 00:22:44,232
So good to see you.

365
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,234
It's about time you
came out for a visit.

366
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,758
Hey everybody this
is my sister, Stacey.

367
00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:51,108
Or should I say
Detective Palermo.

368
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:52,675
Stacey, the gang.

369
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:55,025
Hi, everybody.

370
00:22:55,156 --> 00:22:56,984
Could I please talk
to you for a second?

371
00:22:57,114 --> 00:22:59,856
Oh, yes, sure OK.

372
00:22:59,987 --> 00:23:00,973
Smoke them if you got them.

373
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:02,337
I'll be a few minutes.

374
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:03,468
Come on this way.

375
00:23:06,776 --> 00:23:08,430
You know you missed our
fundraiser the other day.

376
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:10,084
Oh god, I know.
I'm sorry.

377
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:11,113
Put me down for a C note.

378
00:23:11,128 --> 00:23:12,027
I'm good for it.

379
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:13,087
You bet I will.

380
00:23:13,217 --> 00:23:15,394
So, what can I do for you.

381
00:23:15,524 --> 00:23:16,510
Cindy this is Lisa.

382
00:23:16,525 --> 00:23:17,831
Hi.

383
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:20,137
Lisa needs a safe place
to stay for a while.

384
00:23:20,268 --> 00:23:22,052
Well, we're just getting
the place in order,

385
00:23:22,183 --> 00:23:24,664
but I'm sure we
can make some room.

386
00:23:24,794 --> 00:23:26,230
- Thanks.
- Sure.

387
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:27,260
Can I use your phone?

388
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:28,842
Yeah, go ahead.

389
00:23:28,972 --> 00:23:30,670
I'll just go wrap up
the meeting and then

390
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,888
we'll get Lisa settled.

391
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:33,237
And you are staying for dinner.

392
00:23:33,368 --> 00:23:35,196
I won't take no for an answer.

393
00:23:35,326 --> 00:23:36,269
Make yourself at home.

394
00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:37,284
Thanks.

395
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,462
She's really nice.

396
00:23:40,593 --> 00:23:41,593
That's my sister.

397
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,859
Uh, Were you baptized Bambi?

398
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:47,948
Is that the name on
your birth certificate?

399
00:23:48,078 --> 00:23:49,732
No, I was named
after the movie.

400
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:50,863
I see.

401
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,610
Ziggy, it's me.

402
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,002
Palermo, where
the hell are you?

403
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:00,874
I'm over at my
sister's shelter.

404
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:02,092
We got caught in a drive by.

405
00:24:02,223 --> 00:24:04,399
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, we're fine.

406
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,706
Lisa just needs a safe
place to stay for a while.

407
00:24:06,836 --> 00:24:07,837
Yeah, the captain
filled me in.

408
00:24:07,968 --> 00:24:08,968
You think she knows anything?

409
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:12,610
I'd say so.

410
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:13,524
All right.

411
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:14,714
Listen, I got it.

412
00:24:14,844 --> 00:24:16,542
What about dinner?

413
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:18,500
I'll have to
take a rain check.

414
00:24:18,631 --> 00:24:20,067
No problem.

415
00:24:20,197 --> 00:24:21,372
Something's come up here anyway.

416
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:22,678
Anything important?

417
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:25,812
- Nothing I can't handle.
- OK.

418
00:24:25,942 --> 00:24:28,205
Then I'll call you
before I leave here.

419
00:24:28,336 --> 00:24:29,336
I'll see you.

420
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:36,823
Miss Bambi, would you like to
join me in a culinary delight?

421
00:24:36,953 --> 00:24:39,434
Lieutenant, I'm not
that kind of girl.

422
00:24:39,565 --> 00:24:40,827
I meant dinner.

423
00:24:40,957 --> 00:24:41,943
Oh super.

424
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:43,220
Yeah.

425
00:24:43,351 --> 00:24:44,918
OK.

426
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:46,397
Put the word
out on the street.

427
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:48,617
I want this bitch found
and I want her dead.

428
00:24:48,748 --> 00:24:50,358
And I don't care what it takes.

429
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,709
If she fingers us, they're going
to lock our asses up in jail

430
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,884
and throw away the key.

431
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,380
Get your fucking
feet off my desk.

432
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,511
Hold on.

433
00:25:19,343 --> 00:25:20,242
Yeah.

434
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:21,243
Boss.

435
00:25:21,258 --> 00:25:22,782
They got Paco and Torrez.

436
00:25:22,912 --> 00:25:24,435
Shit.

437
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:26,786
But I followed them to an
old house on Route Seven.

438
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:27,815
It's easy to get into.

439
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,049
We'll take them down.

440
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:30,267
- Just get the hell out here.
- All right.

441
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:31,297
Good work, Chico.

442
00:25:31,312 --> 00:25:34,054
Be right over.

443
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:35,185
Saddle up, boys.

444
00:25:35,316 --> 00:25:36,316
Pay back time.

445
00:25:54,422 --> 00:25:57,381
Look, I can't help you
if you don't help me.

446
00:25:57,512 --> 00:26:00,602
If you saw somebody or
someone, you've got to tell me.

447
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:04,998
Hey, why don't you two
come out meet the girls.

448
00:26:05,128 --> 00:26:06,303
All right, let's go
get you settled in.

449
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:15,661
We all pitch in and work
as a team around here.

450
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:18,272
Makes everybody feel
needed and important.

451
00:26:18,402 --> 00:26:19,665
This is Sammy Jo.

452
00:26:19,795 --> 00:26:21,275
She comes to us all
the way from Quebec.

453
00:26:21,405 --> 00:26:22,405
Hi, Sammy Jo.

454
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,485
What's with her?

455
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,486
Don't take offense.

456
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:32,025
She's been through a lot.

457
00:26:32,155 --> 00:26:33,809
About two months
ago, they found her

458
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,377
in an alley completely naked,
gagged, beaten left for dead.

459
00:26:36,507 --> 00:26:39,293
She hasn't spoken a word since.

460
00:26:39,423 --> 00:26:41,164
Jesus, that's so sad.

461
00:26:41,295 --> 00:26:42,818
Yeah.

462
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:45,386
And of course, they never
found the guy who did it.

463
00:26:45,516 --> 00:26:47,649
Oh, and here's Charisse with
some of her famous biscuits.

464
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,782
Hey, looks like I'm going to
have to fix two more plates.

465
00:26:49,912 --> 00:26:52,306
You look like you could
use a good meal, huh girl?

466
00:26:52,436 --> 00:26:53,422
I am kind of hungry.

467
00:26:53,437 --> 00:26:54,437
Well, sit on down girl.

468
00:26:54,525 --> 00:26:56,092
Eat as much as you want.

469
00:26:56,223 --> 00:26:57,267
We're going to put some meat
on that little ass of yours.

470
00:26:57,398 --> 00:26:59,182
Charisse.

471
00:26:59,313 --> 00:27:00,255
Are you the cook?

472
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,663
No, I'm not the cook.

473
00:27:01,794 --> 00:27:04,100
I'm just the same as
anyone else here, homeless.

474
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:05,362
OK?

475
00:27:05,493 --> 00:27:06,886
How did you wind up here?

476
00:27:07,016 --> 00:27:09,453
Let's see, a broken
collarbone, fractured skull,

477
00:27:09,584 --> 00:27:10,759
dislocated shoulder.

478
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:11,890
God, he did that to you?

479
00:27:11,978 --> 00:27:13,022
To me?

480
00:27:13,153 --> 00:27:15,068
No, honey, it's
what I did to him.

481
00:27:15,198 --> 00:27:17,940
See, I got tired of him
putting his hands on me.

482
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:19,638
So I wanted till
we went to bed one

483
00:27:19,768 --> 00:27:23,163
night and beat his mother
fucking ass with a frying pan.

484
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:25,600
Hey, you got to look
out for number one.

485
00:27:25,731 --> 00:27:27,341
Rita, come on in.

486
00:27:27,471 --> 00:27:29,909
Rita, this is Lisa
and my sister, Stacey.

487
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:32,215
Hi.

488
00:27:32,346 --> 00:27:34,914
Thanks, honey.

489
00:27:35,044 --> 00:27:37,830
She can be very emotionally
unstable at times.

490
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,353
She spent the last
three years in prison

491
00:27:39,483 --> 00:27:41,398
for murdering her
abusive husband.

492
00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:43,270
But we're trying
to find some way

493
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,751
to ease her back into some
kind of normal existence.

494
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:48,014
Oh, and here's Helen.

495
00:27:48,144 --> 00:27:49,406
Hello.

496
00:27:49,537 --> 00:27:50,523
Hi.

497
00:27:50,538 --> 00:27:51,626
Watch what you say.

498
00:27:51,757 --> 00:27:53,933
The place is bugged.

499
00:27:54,063 --> 00:27:55,804
She's a paranoid
schizophrenic.

500
00:27:55,935 --> 00:27:57,501
What?

501
00:27:57,632 --> 00:27:59,678
She thinks that government
agents are out to kill her.

502
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:01,636
Oh, and last but
not least, Toni.

503
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:04,813
Toni, this is Lisa
and my sister, Stacey.

504
00:28:04,944 --> 00:28:06,554
We've met.

505
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,425
I was going to say you look
familiar, but I can't remember.

506
00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:11,602
You busted my boyfriend.

507
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:13,953
Johnny Cotello.

508
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,303
And thanks to you, I'm
stuck living in this shithole.

509
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:17,433
Toni.

510
00:28:17,478 --> 00:28:18,914
Well, it ain't the Waldorf.

511
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:20,524
Look, one day you're
going to thank me for doing

512
00:28:20,655 --> 00:28:21,510
you a really big favor.

513
00:28:21,525 --> 00:28:23,179
A favor?

514
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,878
My boyfriend is in
jail because of you.

515
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:27,618
Well, jail is exactly
where he belongs.

516
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:28,881
Stacey.

517
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:30,404
You know, I swear
to God if I could

518
00:28:30,534 --> 00:28:32,188
put a bullet through your
fucking skull I would.

519
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,277
Hey, that's
enough, both of you.

520
00:28:34,408 --> 00:28:36,932
I don't care if she's
your sister or not, OK.?

521
00:28:37,063 --> 00:28:39,021
Don't expect me to lay
out the welcome mat.

522
00:28:39,152 --> 00:28:41,850
I'm not hungry.

523
00:28:41,981 --> 00:28:42,967
I'm sorry.

524
00:28:42,982 --> 00:28:44,679
It's OK.

525
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,942
What kind of place
did you get me into?

526
00:28:47,073 --> 00:28:50,903
Would you rather go
back to your apartment?

527
00:28:51,033 --> 00:28:53,122
Listen, you guys make
yourselves at home.

528
00:28:53,253 --> 00:28:55,081
I'm going to go
get Dan and Mike.

529
00:28:55,211 --> 00:28:56,517
Dan and Mike?

530
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:57,910
The maintenance guys.

531
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,172
This place would fall
apart without them.

532
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:08,833
Hey, guys.

533
00:29:08,877 --> 00:29:09,820
Dinner's on the table.

534
00:29:09,835 --> 00:29:10,879
All right.
Coming in.

535
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:11,909
Well, hurry.

536
00:29:11,924 --> 00:29:13,882
It'll get cold.

537
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:14,912
Come on, Dan.

538
00:29:14,927 --> 00:29:16,755
Charisse made biscuits.

539
00:29:16,885 --> 00:29:18,104
Dan?

540
00:29:18,234 --> 00:29:19,090
Dan!
Oh my god.

541
00:29:19,105 --> 00:29:20,193
He's shot!
Mike!

542
00:29:20,323 --> 00:29:22,195
Dan!

543
00:29:22,325 --> 00:29:23,311
Get him inside.

544
00:29:23,326 --> 00:29:24,326
Get him inside.

545
00:29:28,854 --> 00:29:31,160
Get him inside!

546
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:35,802
Get down!

547
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:36,817
Stay on the floor!

548
00:29:40,387 --> 00:29:41,387
Stacey.

549
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:12,853
Stay down.

550
00:30:15,726 --> 00:30:18,599
Where's she going?

551
00:30:18,729 --> 00:30:20,079
Shoot the motherfuckers.

552
00:30:42,971 --> 00:30:43,971
Shoot, girl.

553
00:30:44,016 --> 00:30:45,191
What the hell is going on here?

554
00:30:45,321 --> 00:30:46,264
This is worse than
my old neighborhood.

555
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:47,367
Just stay down.

556
00:30:47,497 --> 00:30:48,483
Did you call for help?

557
00:30:48,498 --> 00:30:49,310
The phone's dead.

558
00:30:49,325 --> 00:30:50,325
Great.

559
00:30:50,413 --> 00:30:51,413
What are we supposed to do now?

560
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:52,313
Well, they stopped.

561
00:30:52,328 --> 00:30:53,939
Maybe they're gone.

562
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:55,201
Cindy, I don't think there's
a chance that they're gone.

563
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:56,331
Everybody just stay calm.

564
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:00,887
Oh, shit, guys.

565
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:01,902
They're back.

566
00:31:07,604 --> 00:31:08,604
Stay where you are.

567
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:34,369
That's him!

568
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,369
Everybody OK?

569
00:31:48,384 --> 00:31:50,038
Sammy Jo?

570
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:51,169
Sammy Jo?

571
00:31:51,257 --> 00:31:52,112
Sammy Jo, it's me.

572
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:53,215
It's Cindy.

573
00:31:53,346 --> 00:31:54,651
It's OK.
It's OK.

574
00:31:54,782 --> 00:31:55,681
Sammy Jo!

575
00:31:55,696 --> 00:31:58,568
It's OK!

576
00:31:58,699 --> 00:32:00,048
That's a good girl.

577
00:32:05,097 --> 00:32:06,083
Is she all right?

578
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:07,098
I hope so.

579
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:16,238
Say one for me too, honey.

580
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:18,588
So, supercop, what
do these guys want?

581
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:20,025
How the hell should I know?

582
00:32:20,155 --> 00:32:21,896
None of this shit
started till you got here.

583
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:23,028
You think it's my fault?

584
00:32:23,158 --> 00:32:24,158
Well, it ain't mine.

585
00:32:24,203 --> 00:32:25,552
It's the government.

586
00:32:25,682 --> 00:32:26,581
It's them.

587
00:32:26,596 --> 00:32:27,815
They found me.

588
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:28,946
Helen, we've been
through this before.

589
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,774
The government is not after you.

590
00:32:30,905 --> 00:32:33,081
How do you know that?

591
00:32:33,212 --> 00:32:34,198
Who are they then?

592
00:32:34,213 --> 00:32:35,388
What do they want?

593
00:32:35,518 --> 00:32:37,085
Maybe they want the money.

594
00:32:37,216 --> 00:32:39,218
I have over $5,000 in cash
upstairs from the fundraiser.

595
00:32:39,348 --> 00:32:40,741
I never made it to the bank.

596
00:32:40,871 --> 00:32:42,656
No, if it was money, they
would have asked for it.

597
00:32:42,786 --> 00:32:43,786
It's my fault.

598
00:32:43,874 --> 00:32:45,006
What they want with you, girl?

599
00:32:45,137 --> 00:32:46,703
What difference does it make?

600
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:48,227
She put us all in danger.

601
00:32:48,357 --> 00:32:49,256
Helen.

602
00:32:49,271 --> 00:32:50,359
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

603
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,231
What do you got
that they all want?

604
00:32:52,361 --> 00:32:53,797
They want me.

605
00:32:53,928 --> 00:32:55,060
That's ridiculous.

606
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:58,672
My boyfriend.

607
00:32:58,802 --> 00:33:01,501
They killed him and I
saw the whole thing.

608
00:33:01,631 --> 00:33:03,285
Oh, great.

609
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:05,809
She has to leave.

610
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,985
You've got to go.

611
00:33:07,115 --> 00:33:08,116
They'll kill her.

612
00:33:08,247 --> 00:33:09,247
They're going to kill us.

613
00:33:09,335 --> 00:33:11,032
No one is going anywhere.

614
00:33:11,163 --> 00:33:12,773
She's going to
get us all killed.

615
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:14,949
Look, maybe somebody heard
the gunshots and called it in.

616
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,342
I don't know, Stacey.

617
00:33:16,472 --> 00:33:17,560
The nearest place is
two miles down the road.

618
00:33:17,691 --> 00:33:18,866
It's not that far.

619
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,215
They could have still
heard the shots.

620
00:33:20,346 --> 00:33:21,651
Yeah, did she mention
it's a firing range?

621
00:33:21,782 --> 00:33:22,870
Great.

622
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,002
Well, the nearest
police station...

623
00:33:24,132 --> 00:33:25,394
Is 10 miles away.

624
00:33:25,525 --> 00:33:26,525
Shit.

625
00:33:30,921 --> 00:33:32,575
Cindy, maybe you were right.

626
00:33:32,706 --> 00:33:34,229
I don't see anybody.

627
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,346
OK.

628
00:33:35,361 --> 00:33:37,406
Let's not do anything rash.

629
00:33:37,537 --> 00:33:38,842
Let's just sit tight and wait.

630
00:33:38,973 --> 00:33:40,366
Wait for what?

631
00:33:40,496 --> 00:33:42,455
For them to come back
here and blow us all away?

632
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:43,847
I agree with her.

633
00:33:43,978 --> 00:33:46,633
She's putting us
all in jeopardy.

634
00:33:46,763 --> 00:33:48,243
We don't even know this girl.

635
00:33:48,374 --> 00:33:50,724
...please
take a chill pill.

636
00:33:50,854 --> 00:33:52,334
You know what I think?

637
00:33:52,465 --> 00:33:54,119
I think you should take your
little friend over there

638
00:33:54,249 --> 00:33:55,859
and you both should get
the hell out of here.

639
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,774
We're not running a
witness protection program.

640
00:33:57,905 --> 00:33:58,906
And do you know what I say?

641
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,951
No one is going anywhere.

642
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:02,953
This girl came to us for
shelter and she's going to get

643
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:05,304
it, just like I gave it to you.

644
00:34:05,434 --> 00:34:06,653
You got that?

645
00:34:06,783 --> 00:34:09,047
I didn't bring the
Wild Bunch with me.

646
00:34:09,177 --> 00:34:10,483
Look, she's right.

647
00:34:10,613 --> 00:34:11,613
I'm going to go.

648
00:34:11,658 --> 00:34:13,007
I'm putting you all in danger.

649
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:15,183
See, even she agrees.

650
00:34:15,314 --> 00:34:17,490
Lisa, I promise
you I'd protect you.

651
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,361
I'm not going to
go back on my word.

652
00:34:19,492 --> 00:34:21,146
That's right, honey.

653
00:34:21,276 --> 00:34:23,844
You're under our roof now and
we take care of each other here.

654
00:34:23,974 --> 00:34:25,976
See, that's right
we're all a team.

655
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:27,282
Las mujeres.

656
00:34:27,413 --> 00:34:28,501
- Isn't that right, Cindy?
- Yes, Rita.

657
00:34:28,631 --> 00:34:29,574
That's right.

658
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:30,589
We are a team.

659
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,295
How you doing on ammo?

660
00:34:40,426 --> 00:34:42,210
Six shots.

661
00:34:42,341 --> 00:34:43,385
That is not a lot.

662
00:34:43,516 --> 00:34:46,258
OK, listen up.
I've got an idea.

663
00:34:46,388 --> 00:34:49,522
I've got two shotguns in the
back of my car in the trunk.

664
00:34:49,652 --> 00:34:51,263
If you can distract them
somehow, I can run out there

665
00:34:51,393 --> 00:34:53,178
get the shotguns,
radio in for help.

666
00:34:53,308 --> 00:34:54,570
All right, that's good.

667
00:34:54,701 --> 00:34:55,600
Give me the keys.

668
00:34:55,615 --> 00:34:56,514
I'll go get them.

669
00:34:56,529 --> 00:34:57,471
Forget it.

670
00:34:57,486 --> 00:34:58,661
I can't ask you to do that.

671
00:34:58,792 --> 00:34:59,923
You're not asking me.

672
00:35:00,054 --> 00:35:01,099
OK, I'm telling you.

673
00:35:01,229 --> 00:35:02,535
I'm not risking any civilians.

674
00:35:11,587 --> 00:35:13,328
Palermo.

675
00:35:13,459 --> 00:35:14,459
Palermo!

676
00:35:19,813 --> 00:35:21,597
She's still on the road, boss.

677
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,946
But I'm sure she heard you.

678
00:35:23,077 --> 00:35:24,905
Don't be a wise ass.

679
00:35:25,035 --> 00:35:27,168
Sagowski just spoke
to a vagrant who

680
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:28,604
said Lisa Wilkes
was already home

681
00:35:28,735 --> 00:35:30,606
when her boyfriend got hit.

682
00:35:30,737 --> 00:35:32,086
You think she saw anything?

683
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:33,696
That's what I'm
trying to find out.

684
00:35:33,827 --> 00:35:35,176
See if you can track
her down, will you?

685
00:35:35,307 --> 00:35:36,293
Oh yeah sure, boss.

686
00:35:36,308 --> 00:35:37,308
Good.

687
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:05,250
Stace, don't you
think if someone

688
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,381
would have called
the police, they

689
00:36:06,512 --> 00:36:07,411
would have been here by now?

690
00:36:07,426 --> 00:36:08,426
Definitely.

691
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,863
I don't know what's going on.

692
00:36:09,993 --> 00:36:10,805
You say you've got a
radio in that car, right?

693
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,908
Forget it.

694
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:13,083
No, I'm not
going to forget it.

695
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:14,824
Look, don't even
think about it.

696
00:36:14,955 --> 00:36:16,348
It's my responsibility.

697
00:36:16,478 --> 00:36:18,611
I'm trained for
dangerous situations.

698
00:36:18,741 --> 00:36:20,656
Besides, you're
working here as a...

699
00:36:20,787 --> 00:36:22,441
As a what?

700
00:36:22,571 --> 00:36:24,007
As a maintenance man, is that
what you were going to say?

701
00:36:24,138 --> 00:36:25,357
Look let me explain
something to you.

702
00:36:25,487 --> 00:36:26,923
All right guys, this
is not helping any.

703
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:29,317
And Mike, as much as I hate
the idea, she is right.

704
00:36:29,448 --> 00:36:30,971
No, Cindy, she's not right.

705
00:36:31,101 --> 00:36:33,147
It's suicide and you know it.

706
00:36:33,278 --> 00:36:35,845
What do you suggest?

707
00:36:35,976 --> 00:36:37,456
We have to create a diversion.

708
00:36:37,586 --> 00:36:39,545
We've got to try to
drama away from the car.

709
00:36:39,675 --> 00:36:41,286
You got any ideas?

710
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:42,678
Well, I got some
bottles downstairs

711
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:44,158
and I got some turpentine.

712
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:45,812
Let's make some
Molotov cocktails.

713
00:36:45,942 --> 00:36:46,928
I've got rags in the kitchen.

714
00:36:46,943 --> 00:36:49,468
Let's go.

715
00:36:49,598 --> 00:36:51,165
All right, guys,
I'll be right back.

716
00:36:54,168 --> 00:36:55,517
Stacey.

717
00:36:55,648 --> 00:37:00,130
I don't know how you do this.

718
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:03,743
God, I just really wish
I had your strength.

719
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:10,750
Where do you
think I got it from?

720
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,448
Love you.

721
00:37:13,579 --> 00:37:14,710
What do you mean
the lines are down?

722
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:15,841
Will you just try it again?

723
00:37:21,543 --> 00:37:22,486
All right, all right.

724
00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:23,501
Thank you.

725
00:37:29,812 --> 00:37:30,711
Freddy.

726
00:37:30,726 --> 00:37:31,988
Yeah.

727
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:33,119
Keep trying to get
Stacey on the radio.

728
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:34,149
I'm going to try
to find her now.

729
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:35,164
You got it.

730
00:38:21,951 --> 00:38:23,562
We could use a couple more.

731
00:38:23,692 --> 00:38:24,911
Great.

732
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:25,984
Just throw them when
you hear me yell.

733
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:27,130
Oh, yes, ma'am.

734
00:38:27,261 --> 00:38:28,828
This isn't the
time for sarcasm.

735
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:31,134
All I'm saying is I
should be the one going.

736
00:38:31,265 --> 00:38:32,120
OK?

737
00:38:32,135 --> 00:38:35,008
I'm not discussing it.

738
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:37,489
Hey.

739
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:39,012
Be careful.

740
00:38:39,142 --> 00:38:40,142
I will.

741
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:55,724
Still no sign of them.

742
00:38:55,855 --> 00:38:57,117
All right.

743
00:38:57,247 --> 00:38:58,146
Just yell as loud as
you can to see if you

744
00:38:58,161 --> 00:38:59,380
see any kind of movement.

745
00:38:59,511 --> 00:39:00,816
All right.

746
00:39:00,947 --> 00:39:03,819
Stacey, please
don't do this for me.

747
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:07,562
I'm doing this for all of us.

748
00:39:07,693 --> 00:39:11,914
Hey, good luck, Sis.

749
00:39:12,045 --> 00:39:13,045
Vaya con Dios.

750
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,050
Now!

751
00:39:22,534 --> 00:39:23,534
Go!

752
00:40:14,629 --> 00:40:15,615
Dispatch.

753
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,589
Dispatch.

754
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:18,719
Shit!

755
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:25,858
Where'd you get that?

756
00:40:25,988 --> 00:40:29,296
Sometimes it just
pays to break the rules.

757
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,254
They're never
going to make it.

758
00:40:31,385 --> 00:40:32,371
I don't know why you said...

759
00:40:32,386 --> 00:40:33,692
She's going to make it.

760
00:41:15,037 --> 00:41:17,387
What are you looking at?

761
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:18,650
Nothing.

762
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,780
Thanks.

763
00:41:24,873 --> 00:41:25,859
Jesus.

764
00:41:25,874 --> 00:41:27,223
God, Helen.
She OK?

765
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:28,354
Helen?

766
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,100
She's dead.

767
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,409
Cindy, I'm so sorry.

768
00:41:48,636 --> 00:41:49,535
Lisa.

769
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,509
Where's Lisa?

770
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:52,538
Lisa!

771
00:41:52,553 --> 00:41:53,553
In here!

772
00:42:00,866 --> 00:42:02,737
Everybody stay down.

773
00:42:02,868 --> 00:42:04,391
- Somebody get some bandages.
- Yeah, I'm on it.

774
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,377
I'll cover the door.

775
00:42:05,392 --> 00:42:06,480
Did you get through?

776
00:42:06,611 --> 00:42:08,613
I got the guns
and ammo, no radio.

777
00:42:08,743 --> 00:42:09,875
- Let's get you out of here.
- Let's go.

778
00:42:10,005 --> 00:42:11,005
Make some room.

779
00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:20,146
Wait a minute.

780
00:42:20,276 --> 00:42:22,148
No.

781
00:42:22,278 --> 00:42:24,542
How can anybody live out here?

782
00:42:24,672 --> 00:42:28,589
Got coyotes up your
ass, everything.

783
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,764
Where the hell are you, Stace?

784
00:42:29,895 --> 00:42:30,895
Come on.

785
00:42:36,205 --> 00:42:37,293
How's that feeling?

786
00:42:37,424 --> 00:42:41,210
Oh, it's, it's fine.

787
00:42:41,341 --> 00:42:44,431
Don't think I'll be playing
softball for a while.

788
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,562
What position do you play?

789
00:42:48,217 --> 00:42:51,656
What position do I play?

790
00:42:51,786 --> 00:42:54,746
After all it's happened, you
still manage to muster up

791
00:42:54,876 --> 00:42:57,139
some small talk, huh?

792
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,358
Helps pass the time, I guess.

793
00:43:02,275 --> 00:43:04,799
Shortstop.

794
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:09,325
First base, that's what I
play, female officers league.

795
00:43:09,456 --> 00:43:10,675
Really?

796
00:43:10,805 --> 00:43:11,704
Yeah.

797
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:13,678
I like first base.

798
00:43:13,808 --> 00:43:15,723
It's an important position.

799
00:43:15,854 --> 00:43:18,726
Should come by the
ball park some time.

800
00:43:18,857 --> 00:43:25,603
I'd like that but, you know
I'm just a uh maintenance man.

801
00:43:25,733 --> 00:43:27,561
Hey, I'm sorry about that.

802
00:43:27,692 --> 00:43:28,823
I apologize.

803
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,335
Thank God.

804
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,350
Someone's coming.

805
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,848
It's a cop.

806
00:43:53,979 --> 00:43:55,850
Well, never thought I'd be
glad to see one of those guys.

807
00:43:59,898 --> 00:44:00,898
It's my partner.

808
00:44:05,773 --> 00:44:07,122
Ziggy, look out!

809
00:44:13,215 --> 00:44:14,215
You bastards!

810
00:44:23,138 --> 00:44:24,138
Fuck you!

811
00:44:33,627 --> 00:44:35,063
Sorry, Stacey.

812
00:44:35,194 --> 00:44:36,194
No!

813
00:44:37,152 --> 00:44:38,152
Sorry.

814
00:44:53,995 --> 00:44:55,257
This is war, gentlemen.

815
00:44:55,388 --> 00:44:56,519
They killed Juan.

816
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:58,783
I want them dead.

817
00:44:58,913 --> 00:45:00,393
Screw the cops.

818
00:45:00,523 --> 00:45:02,264
Chico, you call in
for extra troops.

819
00:45:06,442 --> 00:45:12,361
They mess with us, we'll give
them a goddamn bloodbath.

820
00:45:22,763 --> 00:45:25,810
Looks like they're getting
ready for another attack.

821
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:28,595
How many do you think?

822
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,119
It's hard to tell.

823
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:32,468
I'd say a few dozen though.

824
00:45:44,437 --> 00:45:46,221
Gotta do something.

825
00:45:49,355 --> 00:45:50,791
I say we barricade
ourselves in.

826
00:45:54,012 --> 00:45:55,970
Look, we don't have
much of a choice.

827
00:45:56,101 --> 00:45:57,319
OK.

828
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:58,450
Let's do it.

829
00:46:01,323 --> 00:46:03,325
All right, guys, listen up.

830
00:46:03,456 --> 00:46:06,111
We're going to do our best
to barricade ourselves in.

831
00:46:06,241 --> 00:46:07,982
Downstairs I've got
lumber and tools.

832
00:46:08,113 --> 00:46:11,290
Let's go down there and
start bringing it up.

833
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:13,248
Also grab anything that
can be used as a weapon.

834
00:46:15,947 --> 00:46:16,948
They may be making a charge.

835
00:46:17,078 --> 00:46:18,078
OK.

836
00:46:22,214 --> 00:46:24,216
Now one last thing.

837
00:46:24,346 --> 00:46:27,306
I can handle that pistol if
you're going to use a shotgun.

838
00:46:27,436 --> 00:46:28,436
OK.

839
00:46:30,962 --> 00:46:31,962
Here.

840
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,536
Any units in the vicinity
of Park and Lincoln,

841
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:41,653
reports of gun fire.

842
00:46:41,668 --> 00:46:43,626
Please respond.

843
00:46:43,757 --> 00:46:44,758
Unit nine to base.

844
00:46:44,889 --> 00:46:45,788
We're on our way.

845
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,066
Ten-four unit nine.

846
00:46:56,117 --> 00:46:57,103
Come on, Sammy.

847
00:46:57,118 --> 00:46:58,104
Here, take that.

848
00:46:58,119 --> 00:46:59,105
Move.

849
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,120
OK.

850
00:47:04,038 --> 00:47:07,389
Come on, Sammy Jo, this way.

851
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,869
Got some more for you.

852
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:09,942
That should hold.

853
00:47:09,957 --> 00:47:11,002
Any more downstairs?

854
00:47:11,132 --> 00:47:12,075
Yeah, do you want
me to go get it?

855
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:13,090
Yeah, hurry.
Thanks.

856
00:47:35,809 --> 00:47:36,810
Don't shoot.

857
00:47:36,941 --> 00:47:38,029
Scared the shit out of me.

858
00:47:41,162 --> 00:47:42,511
Just thought I'd
come down and help.

859
00:47:42,642 --> 00:47:43,642
It's OK.
I got it.

860
00:47:46,385 --> 00:47:48,387
So why did you do it?

861
00:47:48,517 --> 00:47:50,258
Do what?

862
00:47:50,389 --> 00:47:51,825
Risk your life to save mine.

863
00:47:51,956 --> 00:47:54,523
It was no big deal.

864
00:47:54,654 --> 00:47:55,829
No big deal.

865
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:56,960
You could have gotten
yourself killed.

866
00:47:57,048 --> 00:47:58,310
But I didn't.

867
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,225
You didn't, so let's
just leave it at that.

868
00:48:00,355 --> 00:48:01,355
OK.

869
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:10,191
Look, I'm really
sorry about Johnny.

870
00:48:10,322 --> 00:48:11,497
Never meant to hurt you.

871
00:48:11,627 --> 00:48:12,672
I was only doing my job.

872
00:48:17,242 --> 00:48:18,808
I wish there some way we
could bury the hatchet.

873
00:48:22,551 --> 00:48:24,031
OK.

874
00:48:24,162 --> 00:48:25,554
Well, I guess I can't blame
you for hating me then.

875
00:48:30,124 --> 00:48:31,124
I don't hate you.

876
00:48:34,607 --> 00:48:39,351
I knew what was going on all
along and I let it happen.

877
00:48:39,481 --> 00:48:41,614
You know, I kept asking
myself over and over

878
00:48:41,744 --> 00:48:43,572
again, what's your limit?

879
00:48:43,703 --> 00:48:46,271
I mean when is it
really enough, you know?

880
00:48:46,401 --> 00:48:48,708
But the truth of the
matter is, I didn't

881
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:51,406
have the strength to walk away.

882
00:48:51,537 --> 00:48:53,756
Toni, don't blame yourself.

883
00:48:53,887 --> 00:48:56,063
I blamed everyone
else for the past year.

884
00:48:56,194 --> 00:48:58,544
I think it's time
I face the facts.

885
00:48:58,674 --> 00:49:00,067
You made a mistake.

886
00:49:00,198 --> 00:49:01,373
You're only human.

887
00:49:01,503 --> 00:49:04,593
We've all got our
war stories to tell.

888
00:49:04,724 --> 00:49:07,640
Now, it's just time to let
it go, start over again.

889
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:09,076
It's easier said than done.

890
00:49:09,207 --> 00:49:10,106
I did it.

891
00:49:10,121 --> 00:49:11,513
So can you.

892
00:49:11,644 --> 00:49:13,167
If you only let your guard
down for a split second,

893
00:49:13,298 --> 00:49:16,388
you realize there are people
around who care about you.

894
00:49:16,518 --> 00:49:18,042
I'm one of them.

895
00:49:18,172 --> 00:49:21,654
I'd love to help, if
you'd only let me.

896
00:49:21,784 --> 00:49:22,960
This is getting heavy.

897
00:49:26,572 --> 00:49:29,967
So what do you say?

898
00:49:30,097 --> 00:49:31,097
OK.

899
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,648
What do you want us to do
with the rest of this wood?

900
00:49:59,779 --> 00:50:00,910
Arm yourselves.

901
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:02,347
Just in case.

902
00:50:02,477 --> 00:50:05,089
They some near me, I'll
slice their conjones.

903
00:50:05,219 --> 00:50:06,873
I don't have any 357 ammo.

904
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,004
Already got it covered.

905
00:50:08,048 --> 00:50:09,136
I had some stashed in the back.

906
00:50:09,267 --> 00:50:10,616
Toni, hey.

907
00:50:10,746 --> 00:50:13,749
Bet you're glad I
got it now, aren't you?

908
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:14,881
All right, guys, listen up.

909
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:15,998
Here's what we're going to do.

910
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,492
Hey, who put you in charge?

911
00:50:17,623 --> 00:50:18,841
You think just because
you're the hombre,

912
00:50:18,972 --> 00:50:20,147
that makes you the boss?

913
00:50:20,278 --> 00:50:21,322
Rita, we are a team here.

914
00:50:21,453 --> 00:50:23,411
Let's hear what he has to say.

915
00:50:23,542 --> 00:50:25,326
If you say so, OK, Cindy.

916
00:50:25,457 --> 00:50:26,443
Yes, Rita, I say so.

917
00:50:26,458 --> 00:50:27,313
Go ahead, Mike.

918
00:50:27,328 --> 00:50:28,851
Thanks.

919
00:50:28,982 --> 00:50:30,592
Everybody's got a weapon, right?

920
00:50:30,723 --> 00:50:31,985
Good.

921
00:50:32,116 --> 00:50:33,465
Because I think you're
going to need it.

922
00:50:33,595 --> 00:50:35,510
Guys, from what I can
tell, it looks to me

923
00:50:35,641 --> 00:50:37,556
like they're planning a charge.

924
00:50:37,686 --> 00:50:40,776
So I say we break into pairs,
each of us take a room.

925
00:50:40,907 --> 00:50:43,344
If they start to break through,
do your best to hold them off.

926
00:50:43,475 --> 00:50:46,130
If you have trouble,
yell it out.

927
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,203
Any objections?

928
00:50:47,218 --> 00:50:48,218
No.

929
00:50:50,569 --> 00:50:52,310
All right.

930
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,440
Let's do it.

931
00:50:57,837 --> 00:51:00,666
Sounds like you know
what you're doing.

932
00:51:00,796 --> 00:51:01,884
Had a little experience.

933
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:05,018
What kind of experience?

934
00:51:05,149 --> 00:51:06,976
Marines.

935
00:51:07,107 --> 00:51:08,630
Why didn't you
tell me that before?

936
00:51:08,761 --> 00:51:12,895
I sort of tried to,
but you wouldn't let me.

937
00:51:13,026 --> 00:51:14,026
Sorry.

938
00:51:16,595 --> 00:51:17,987
So what brought you
here from the Marines?

939
00:51:21,121 --> 00:51:24,255
My little sister
used to be here.

940
00:51:24,385 --> 00:51:26,474
She used to live here
while I was overseas.

941
00:51:26,605 --> 00:51:27,867
But she got into
a lot of trouble

942
00:51:27,997 --> 00:51:30,217
and sort of fell in
with the wrong crowd,

943
00:51:30,348 --> 00:51:31,958
if you know what I mean.

944
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:35,048
Your sister Cindy was the only
one that would help her out.

945
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:36,615
She's terrific, your sister.

946
00:51:36,745 --> 00:51:38,312
Yeah, I know.

947
00:51:38,443 --> 00:51:39,748
Well, when I got
back from overseas,

948
00:51:39,879 --> 00:51:41,924
I came back here
looking for her.

949
00:51:42,055 --> 00:51:43,839
We were going to
move up to Oregon.

950
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:45,972
Figured it would be
good for her and figured

951
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,061
it would be good for me.

952
00:51:48,192 --> 00:51:51,282
She's the only
family I have left.

953
00:51:51,412 --> 00:51:54,502
When I got back here Cindy
told me that she had run off.

954
00:51:54,633 --> 00:51:58,506
I went looking for her but
I didn't have much luck.

955
00:51:58,637 --> 00:51:59,942
I came back here.

956
00:52:00,073 --> 00:52:04,251
I stayed, hoping that
she would come back too.

957
00:52:04,382 --> 00:52:08,299
She knew you were
here, she'd be back.

958
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:09,952
Listen, everybody's set.

959
00:52:10,083 --> 00:52:11,069
It's been quiet.

960
00:52:11,084 --> 00:52:12,070
Do you think they left?

961
00:52:12,085 --> 00:52:13,608
I don't think so.

962
00:52:13,739 --> 00:52:14,740
I think they're
just waiting us out.

963
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:16,220
Oh, shit.

964
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:17,350
I can't believe no one
has called the police.

965
00:52:23,096 --> 00:52:24,402
Unit nine to base.

966
00:52:24,532 --> 00:52:25,794
Go ahead, Unit nine.

967
00:52:25,925 --> 00:52:27,405
No sign of any activity.

968
00:52:27,535 --> 00:52:28,535
Everything's pretty quiet.

969
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:29,755
10-4.

970
00:52:29,885 --> 00:52:31,017
Give it the once
around one more time.

971
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,149
10-4.

972
00:52:32,279 --> 00:52:33,279
One more time.

973
00:52:42,681 --> 00:52:47,294
Hey, I just want to say
that I'm sorry about all this.

974
00:52:47,425 --> 00:52:48,774
I feel like this
is all my fault.

975
00:52:48,904 --> 00:52:50,210
It's not your fault.

976
00:52:50,341 --> 00:52:52,604
But it is my fault.
I mean, if I had just

977
00:52:52,734 --> 00:52:54,649
been honest with the police
from the start none of this

978
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,129
would have never happened.

979
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,783
I was just so scared.

980
00:52:57,913 --> 00:52:59,654
Lisa, everybody gets scared.

981
00:52:59,785 --> 00:53:00,960
Yeah well I've
caused so much trouble

982
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:02,570
and I feel so responsible.

983
00:53:02,701 --> 00:53:04,877
I know but you
are not to blame.

984
00:53:05,007 --> 00:53:06,705
Look, you just have to
accept that what's done is done

985
00:53:06,835 --> 00:53:08,141
and move on.

986
00:53:08,272 --> 00:53:10,012
I know it isn't easy
but we're here for you,

987
00:53:10,143 --> 00:53:11,405
and when all this is over.

988
00:53:11,536 --> 00:53:13,102
You mean if we make
it out of here alive.

989
00:53:13,233 --> 00:53:16,541
No.
I mean when all this is over.

990
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:19,718
I hope you decide
to stay on with us.

991
00:53:19,848 --> 00:53:22,677
You really mean that?

992
00:53:22,808 --> 00:53:27,813
Yeah, Lisa, I really mean it.

993
00:53:27,943 --> 00:53:28,943
I see great things in you.

994
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:35,037
That's the first time anyone
has ever said that to me.

995
00:53:43,916 --> 00:53:45,657
Captain.

996
00:53:45,787 --> 00:53:46,730
You find them?

997
00:53:46,745 --> 00:53:47,789
Line is dead.

998
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,051
Disconnected?

999
00:53:49,182 --> 00:53:50,168
No, the phone
company says they're

1000
00:53:50,183 --> 00:53:51,271
having a problem in the area.

1001
00:53:51,402 --> 00:53:52,794
Send over a squad car.

1002
00:53:52,925 --> 00:53:54,405
Sure thing, Captain.

1003
00:53:54,535 --> 00:53:55,580
Got one right near there,
checking on a report of...

1004
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:56,710
Now!

1005
00:53:56,798 --> 00:53:57,798
Right, Captain.

1006
00:54:04,676 --> 00:54:06,895
Just pray, Sammy Jo.

1007
00:54:07,026 --> 00:54:08,245
God will see us through this.

1008
00:54:22,128 --> 00:54:23,128
Pray for me too.

1009
00:54:27,655 --> 00:54:29,222
Quiet as a graveyard.

1010
00:54:29,353 --> 00:54:30,571
Yeah, pretty dead.

1011
00:54:30,702 --> 00:54:32,181
Let's get something to eat.

1012
00:54:32,312 --> 00:54:34,096
Gurdy, you're always eating.

1013
00:54:34,227 --> 00:54:37,099
Take a left at the next corner,
the best coffee shop in town

1014
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:38,362
is about a mile down.

1015
00:54:38,492 --> 00:54:40,494
Hey, wait a minute.

1016
00:54:40,625 --> 00:54:44,324
Looks like we got some activity.

1017
00:54:44,455 --> 00:54:46,283
I don't like the looks of this.

1018
00:55:10,132 --> 00:55:11,308
Call the Sarge.

1019
00:55:11,438 --> 00:55:12,526
Get him to contact
the phone company.

1020
00:55:25,887 --> 00:55:26,887
Penny.

1021
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,150
Come here and check this out.

1022
00:55:37,899 --> 00:55:38,899
Base to Unit nine.

1023
00:55:38,944 --> 00:55:40,902
Come in.

1024
00:55:41,033 --> 00:55:43,731
Come in, Unit nine.

1025
00:55:43,862 --> 00:55:47,126
Man, are you as
hungry as I am?

1026
00:55:47,256 --> 00:55:51,435
Was kind of looking
forward to those biscuits.

1027
00:55:51,565 --> 00:55:55,656
Yeah, well if these guys don't
kill us, those biscuits will.

1028
00:55:55,787 --> 00:55:56,831
Come in, Unit nine.

1029
00:55:56,962 --> 00:55:57,962
Damn.

1030
00:56:00,705 --> 00:56:03,621
Unit 12?

1031
00:56:03,751 --> 00:56:04,751
Come in, Unit 12.

1032
00:56:14,327 --> 00:56:16,721
This wait is going
to drive me nuts.

1033
00:56:16,851 --> 00:56:18,505
Girl, you already nuts.

1034
00:56:18,636 --> 00:56:19,724
You should talk.

1035
00:56:19,854 --> 00:56:21,334
You're the craziest
bitch I know.

1036
00:56:21,465 --> 00:56:23,292
Honey, I spent
my whole life going

1037
00:56:23,423 --> 00:56:25,469
in and out of bad situations.

1038
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,079
If I didn't laugh
it off, I think

1039
00:56:27,209 --> 00:56:29,386
I'd just shrivel up and die.

1040
00:56:29,516 --> 00:56:31,039
I hear you.

1041
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:33,868
Yeah, my mama always told
me, things are looking bad,

1042
00:56:33,999 --> 00:56:35,870
just be thankful
they ain't worse.

1043
00:56:36,001 --> 00:56:37,481
Yeah, well.

1044
00:56:37,611 --> 00:56:39,396
they can't get much
worse than this.

1045
00:56:39,526 --> 00:56:40,526
You got that right.

1046
00:57:03,202 --> 00:57:04,202
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1047
00:57:11,645 --> 00:57:14,213
Got something funny going on.

1048
00:57:14,343 --> 00:57:15,910
I am not in a laughing mood.

1049
00:57:16,041 --> 00:57:16,983
Did you find them?

1050
00:57:16,998 --> 00:57:18,217
That's just it.

1051
00:57:18,347 --> 00:57:19,523
I've already sent
tow cars to the area

1052
00:57:19,653 --> 00:57:21,046
and I can't get either
one on the radio.

1053
00:57:21,176 --> 00:57:22,700
Damn it.

1054
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:24,092
If that is pulling
another practical joke,

1055
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:25,078
I swear I...

1056
00:57:25,093 --> 00:57:26,268
I don't think so.

1057
00:57:26,399 --> 00:57:27,618
I've checked with
the phone company.

1058
00:57:27,748 --> 00:57:29,010
They can't find their
repair team either.

1059
00:57:29,141 --> 00:57:30,751
- What are you telling me?
- I don't know.

1060
00:57:30,882 --> 00:57:32,492
It's like the whole neighborhood
just turned into the Bermuda

1061
00:57:32,623 --> 00:57:33,928
Triangle or something.

1062
00:57:34,059 --> 00:57:36,453
Fredericks, do I have
to go down there myself?

1063
00:57:36,583 --> 00:57:37,715
I'll send another unit.

1064
00:57:37,845 --> 00:57:39,238
And send them
straight to the shelter.

1065
00:57:39,368 --> 00:57:40,631
And make sure they stay
in constant radio contact.

1066
00:57:40,761 --> 00:57:41,704
Right.

1067
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:43,677
I just wanted you to know.

1068
00:57:43,808 --> 00:57:44,896
Bermuda freaking triangle.

1069
00:57:52,338 --> 00:57:54,296
What are you thinking?

1070
00:57:54,427 --> 00:57:56,168
I think your hunch was right.

1071
00:57:56,298 --> 00:57:57,430
They're just waiting us out.

1072
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:02,827
Look.

1073
00:58:02,957 --> 00:58:04,872
Cindy, it's the police!

1074
00:58:05,003 --> 00:58:06,003
Oh, my god.

1075
00:58:20,584 --> 00:58:22,847
Thank God you're here.

1076
00:58:22,977 --> 00:58:24,849
No, get down!

1077
00:58:24,979 --> 00:58:26,328
Oh, my god, no!

1078
00:58:29,549 --> 00:58:31,812
Everybody, back
to their posts.

1079
00:58:32,987 --> 00:58:35,337
Hey, Chico, we got company.

1080
00:59:06,368 --> 00:59:07,761
Oh, shit, stay back.

1081
00:59:07,892 --> 00:59:08,892
Stay back.

1082
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:19,990
Cover the windows.

1083
01:00:04,252 --> 01:00:05,238
Here, take this.

1084
01:00:05,253 --> 01:00:06,253
Go!

1085
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,200
Get down!

1086
01:02:22,216 --> 01:02:23,072
We did it!

1087
01:02:23,087 --> 01:02:24,610
We kicked their ass.

1088
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:27,482
Thank god.

1089
01:02:27,613 --> 01:02:28,745
They just gave up.

1090
01:02:28,875 --> 01:02:30,442
Yeah, right.

1091
01:02:30,572 --> 01:02:31,748
They're not going to stop
till they get what they want.

1092
01:02:31,878 --> 01:02:33,010
We're not going
to die in here.

1093
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:34,083
Rita, back off.

1094
01:02:34,098 --> 01:02:35,098
No.

1095
01:02:35,142 --> 01:02:36,274
She's the one that they want.

1096
01:02:36,404 --> 01:02:37,928
Why don't you just
let them have her?

1097
01:02:38,058 --> 01:02:39,538
We're not all going to suffer.

1098
01:02:39,668 --> 01:02:41,627
You never cease to amaze me.
Don't pay her no mind.

1099
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:42,758
She's just tripping as usual.

1100
01:02:42,802 --> 01:02:43,745
Guys, come on.

1101
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,065
We're not out of this yet.

1102
01:02:45,196 --> 01:02:46,588
We're got to get these
windows boarded back up.

1103
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:47,764
Forget the windows.

1104
01:02:47,894 --> 01:02:49,417
We got to make
some kind of move.

1105
01:02:49,548 --> 01:02:51,115
How much longer do you think
we can all hold them off?

1106
01:02:51,245 --> 01:02:52,899
As long as it takes.

1107
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:54,118
There's no way we're getting out
of here without being detected.

1108
01:02:58,035 --> 01:02:59,819
Why don't we just
blow the place up then?

1109
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:01,212
Girl, have you lost your mind?

1110
01:03:01,342 --> 01:03:02,735
You got a better idea?

1111
01:03:02,866 --> 01:03:03,910
Wait a minute.

1112
01:03:04,041 --> 01:03:05,390
Toni, what are you thinking?

1113
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:10,134
OK, look, if we can
lure them in somehow,

1114
01:03:10,264 --> 01:03:13,790
we could trap them inside and
blow the place up with gas.

1115
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,139
How?

1116
01:03:15,269 --> 01:03:16,444
Turn on all the gas
jets in the kitchen,

1117
01:03:16,575 --> 01:03:17,750
throw a can in the microwave.

1118
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:19,534
And how do we get out?

1119
01:03:19,665 --> 01:03:21,667
Once they're inside,
we go downstairs, and get

1120
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,625
out the doors to the basement.

1121
01:03:23,756 --> 01:03:26,280
Stace, what do you think?

1122
01:03:26,411 --> 01:03:28,108
Well...

1123
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:30,807
I got to tell you, this is not
the best idea I've ever heard.

1124
01:03:30,937 --> 01:03:33,722
Well, unless someone's
got a better one,

1125
01:03:33,853 --> 01:03:35,376
I really don't see we
have much of a choice.

1126
01:03:35,507 --> 01:03:36,856
Anybody?

1127
01:03:39,859 --> 01:03:41,078
All right, that settles it.

1128
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:42,208
Let's just do it.

1129
01:03:57,355 --> 01:03:58,747
Captain.

1130
01:03:58,878 --> 01:03:59,966
What is it now, Fredericks?

1131
01:04:00,097 --> 01:04:01,185
Alien abduction?

1132
01:04:01,315 --> 01:04:03,013
Worse.

1133
01:04:03,143 --> 01:04:05,363
I got a couple reports from the
47th precinct about gangbangers

1134
01:04:05,493 --> 01:04:08,453
cruising around,
gunfire in the area.

1135
01:04:08,583 --> 01:04:09,976
Still no word from
any of our units.

1136
01:04:10,107 --> 01:04:11,369
Sagowski or Palermo.

1137
01:04:11,499 --> 01:04:13,762
Shit.

1138
01:04:13,893 --> 01:04:16,983
Wait a minute.

1139
01:04:17,114 --> 01:04:18,202
This graffiti.

1140
01:04:18,332 --> 01:04:20,421
It's gang death notice.

1141
01:04:20,552 --> 01:04:22,989
They found out where
Lisa Wilkes is.

1142
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,599
Alert the SWAT team.

1143
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:26,384
Get every available
unit down there now.

1144
01:04:26,514 --> 01:04:27,602
Call the neighboring precincts.

1145
01:04:27,733 --> 01:04:28,865
We need backup.

1146
01:04:28,995 --> 01:04:29,995
Go!

1147
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:45,359
Lisa, get the tape.

1148
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,021
Come on, Trace, you're
making a meal out of it.

1149
01:04:55,152 --> 01:04:56,588
One more and
we'll call it a day.

1150
01:04:56,718 --> 01:04:57,718
Got it.

1151
01:05:19,611 --> 01:05:20,611
All right, listen up.

1152
01:05:23,354 --> 01:05:26,313
Guys come back here licking
your wounds like you went

1153
01:05:26,444 --> 01:05:30,013
up against some major people.

1154
01:05:30,143 --> 01:05:34,147
They're just a bunch
of bitches, man.

1155
01:05:34,278 --> 01:05:37,063
Here, take this.

1156
01:05:37,194 --> 01:05:38,282
You think this
is going to work?

1157
01:05:38,412 --> 01:05:39,412
It better.

1158
01:05:41,546 --> 01:05:44,027
- Body's in the roof.
- The house is all set.

1159
01:05:44,157 --> 01:05:45,157
We need to get
into the basement.

1160
01:05:45,245 --> 01:05:46,420
Let's go.

1161
01:05:46,551 --> 01:05:47,639
Let me finish up.
I'll be right there.

1162
01:05:47,769 --> 01:05:48,769
All right.
Girls, move.

1163
01:05:52,687 --> 01:05:53,819
All right, you listen to me.

1164
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,386
You make this quick.

1165
01:05:55,516 --> 01:05:56,516
This place is ready to go.

1166
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:08,862
Go, go go.

1167
01:06:08,877 --> 01:06:09,877
Move, Move, move.

1168
01:06:29,289 --> 01:06:30,275
Come on!
Come on!

1169
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:31,146
Where's Stacey?

1170
01:06:31,161 --> 01:06:32,161
I don't know!

1171
01:06:38,124 --> 01:06:39,821
Now what we're
going to do is we're

1172
01:06:39,952 --> 01:06:42,607
going to storm this place.

1173
01:06:42,737 --> 01:06:45,392
And we're going to do it
before the god damn cops

1174
01:06:45,523 --> 01:06:47,264
get here with their army.

1175
01:06:54,184 --> 01:06:55,184
Where's Stacey?
She's coming.

1176
01:06:55,272 --> 01:06:56,272
Move.

1177
01:07:04,977 --> 01:07:06,196
All right.
Everybody all right?

1178
01:07:06,326 --> 01:07:07,312
- Yeah.
- All right.

1179
01:07:07,327 --> 01:07:08,589
Sit tight.

1180
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,548
And you ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.

1181
01:07:10,678 --> 01:07:13,159
Because I know I am.

1182
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:14,508
So do it right this time.

1183
01:07:18,512 --> 01:07:19,512
Shit.

1184
01:07:19,557 --> 01:07:20,862
They've got Chico.

1185
01:07:31,699 --> 01:07:34,093
I want everybody
in that house dead.

1186
01:08:11,565 --> 01:08:13,524
When Stacey gets here,
we'll blow this hole

1187
01:08:13,654 --> 01:08:14,510
and get out of here.

1188
01:08:14,525 --> 01:08:16,396
Shit.

1189
01:08:16,527 --> 01:08:17,876
Where's she going?

1190
01:08:27,277 --> 01:08:28,843
I gotta get something.

1191
01:08:28,974 --> 01:08:30,106
No, forget it.
It's too late.

1192
01:08:30,236 --> 01:08:31,222
I can't wait.

1193
01:08:31,237 --> 01:08:32,586
Cindy.

1194
01:08:32,717 --> 01:08:33,703
Cindy.

1195
01:08:33,718 --> 01:08:34,718
Cindy!

1196
01:09:01,224 --> 01:09:02,616
There's Stacey.

1197
01:09:02,747 --> 01:09:04,096
What is she waiting for?

1198
01:09:14,324 --> 01:09:15,324
Come on!

1199
01:09:38,217 --> 01:09:39,217
Let's go.

1200
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:43,686
Shit!

1201
01:09:43,701 --> 01:09:44,701
It's locked.

1202
01:09:48,706 --> 01:09:49,706
Locked?

1203
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:50,882
What do you mean locked?

1204
01:09:51,012 --> 01:09:52,579
I never locked it
from the outside.

1205
01:10:13,252 --> 01:10:14,252
Come on!

1206
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:28,572
Come on, follow me.

1207
01:10:45,763 --> 01:10:48,113
Come on, come on, let's go.

1208
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:51,116
Rita, come on, you first.

1209
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:52,247
Good girl.

1210
01:11:05,783 --> 01:11:07,132
Come on, come on, come on!

1211
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,742
Come on, you're next.

1212
01:11:08,873 --> 01:11:11,092
You get your tired ass up
there before..

1213
01:11:27,848 --> 01:11:28,848
Come on!

1214
01:12:19,247 --> 01:12:20,597
How you doing?

1215
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:32,245
That's enough.

1216
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:33,260
Come on, let's go.

1217
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:43,141
Move, Move.

1218
01:12:43,271 --> 01:12:44,490
Sammy Jo, please.

1219
01:12:44,621 --> 01:12:45,970
We gotta go.

1220
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:48,407
Come on.

1221
01:12:53,412 --> 01:12:55,109
Leave them alone!

1222
01:13:01,986 --> 01:13:03,814
Where are they?

1223
01:13:03,944 --> 01:13:05,163
I'm not telling you shit.

1224
01:13:05,293 --> 01:13:06,293
Ah.

1225
01:13:20,134 --> 01:13:22,485
Come on, come on.

1226
01:13:25,618 --> 01:13:27,011
Where's Stacey?

1227
01:13:27,141 --> 01:13:28,447
There's no time.
Get down, everybody.

1228
01:13:28,578 --> 01:13:29,578
Get down now.

1229
01:13:35,541 --> 01:13:37,935
This could be next.

1230
01:13:38,065 --> 01:13:41,852
Oh, god, there's
not enough time.

1231
01:14:30,944 --> 01:14:31,944
Get the door.

1232
01:14:34,339 --> 01:14:35,325
Mike?

1233
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:36,326
Stacey?

1234
01:14:36,341 --> 01:14:37,283
Stacey?

1235
01:14:37,298 --> 01:14:38,691
Mike?

1236
01:14:38,822 --> 01:14:39,808
Mike?

1237
01:14:39,823 --> 01:14:40,765
Stacey?

1238
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:41,679
Stacey?

1239
01:14:41,694 --> 01:14:43,130
Mike?

1240
01:14:43,261 --> 01:14:45,176
Stacey!

1241
01:14:45,306 --> 01:14:46,205
Come on!

1242
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:47,220
Come on!

1243
01:14:49,789 --> 01:14:50,688
Move!

1244
01:14:50,703 --> 01:14:51,703
Come on.

1245
01:14:59,712 --> 01:15:00,712
Cindy!

1246
01:15:03,368 --> 01:15:05,109
Get out the door.

1247
01:15:05,239 --> 01:15:07,764
Out the door.

1248
01:15:07,894 --> 01:15:08,793
Stacey.

1249
01:15:08,808 --> 01:15:09,808
Stacey, what...

1250
01:15:17,643 --> 01:15:20,254
Drop all your
weapons, or I'm going

1251
01:15:20,385 --> 01:15:22,430
to blow her fucking brains out.

1252
01:15:22,561 --> 01:15:24,998
And I'm going to
do it in such a way

1253
01:15:25,129 --> 01:15:28,349
that I won't even get a
speck of blood on my clothes.

1254
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:03,009
What was that?

1255
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:04,271
Jesus.
my

1256
01:17:04,402 --> 01:17:05,301
God.

1257
01:17:05,316 --> 01:17:06,316
Oh.

1258
01:17:13,324 --> 01:17:15,195
You OK?

1259
01:17:15,326 --> 01:17:16,326
Yeah.

1260
01:17:28,034 --> 01:17:30,210
Palermo, what the
hell is going on?

1261
01:17:30,341 --> 01:17:32,473
We've got everything
under control, sir.

1262
01:17:32,604 --> 01:17:33,736
All right?

1263
01:17:33,866 --> 01:17:35,172
Yeah, thanks.

1264
01:17:35,302 --> 01:17:36,521
Good.

1265
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:37,696
Let's clean this mess up.

1266
01:17:42,875 --> 01:17:44,660
Sweet Jesus.

1267
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:46,183
What are we going to do now?

1268
01:17:46,313 --> 01:17:48,315
Well, I suggest we start
looking for a new place.

1269
01:17:53,494 --> 01:17:55,366
You know what?

1270
01:17:55,496 --> 01:17:57,977
Might be a little crowded,
but until you guys find a place,

1271
01:17:58,108 --> 01:17:59,152
why don't you guys
just stay with me?

1272
01:17:59,283 --> 01:18:00,283
OK.

1273
01:18:05,463 --> 01:18:07,117
Even me?

1274
01:18:07,247 --> 01:18:09,685
Especially you, Toni.

1275
01:18:09,815 --> 01:18:11,382
That's right.

1276
01:18:11,512 --> 01:18:12,512
It's time to start over.

1277
01:18:14,428 --> 01:18:15,327
Hey.

1278
01:18:15,342 --> 01:18:16,953
What?

1279
01:18:17,083 --> 01:18:18,084
What on earth was so important
for you to go all the way

1280
01:18:18,215 --> 01:18:19,477
back upstairs like you did?

1281
01:18:19,607 --> 01:18:20,593
Fundraiser money.

1282
01:18:20,608 --> 01:18:22,088
I worked too hard for this.

1283
01:18:22,219 --> 01:18:23,699
And hey, it certainly came
in handy, don't you think?

1284
01:18:25,962 --> 01:18:26,962
Maybe.

1285
01:18:30,009 --> 01:18:32,272
Oh, just leave me
out of it, girls.

1286
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,456
How you doing?

1287
01:18:42,587 --> 01:18:43,849
I'm good.

1288
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:44,980
how you doing?

1289
01:18:47,157 --> 01:18:49,376
Everybody is coming over to
stay at my place for a while

1290
01:18:49,507 --> 01:18:51,814
until they get resettled.

1291
01:18:51,944 --> 01:18:55,513
I was thinking I could make some
room for you, if you'd like.

1292
01:18:55,643 --> 01:18:57,863
Aren't you afraid
I might get on base.

1293
01:19:03,173 --> 01:19:04,827
Come here.
