1
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,772
      It's coming for us,
            Captain!

2
00:00:39,774 --> 00:00:42,708
          It has eyes
     as big as basketballs.

3
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:47,446
     It can see everywhere,
 even in the pitch black water.

4
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:50,349
         It has a beak
     like Mom's parakeets,

5
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:52,584
  but a thousand times bigger,

6
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,820
        that can cut you
         right in half,

7
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:58,290
    and eight legs that can
  rip a blue whale's head off,

8
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:00,759
   and tentacles that feed it
          to its beak.

9
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:03,062
   If it gets me, I'm toast.

10
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:07,199
        If it gets you,
    you're a bacon sandwich.

11
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:09,234
Watch out, Captain!

12
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,637
  The leviathan has the ship!

13
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,508
  We're going under, Wee Wee!

14
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,392
        Hey, Johnathan?

15
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,961
          - Johnathan.
            - What?

16
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:51,697
    Man, I told you to check
  the traps, not go swimming.

17
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:53,999
       - We went fishing.
  - You can't fish underwater.

18
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,001
        - And who is we?
       - Me and Wee Wee.

19
00:03:56,003 --> 00:04:00,239
 Don't molest that pig, and go
 get ready for school, please.

20
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:02,007
    Naw. Take your medicine.

21
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,445
       Mm-mm! All of it.

22
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:07,613
            Come on.

23
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,751
          Chew it up.
      I wanna see it gone.

24
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,717
             Linda!

25
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,661
- Hello.
<i>-  You have a collect call from--</i>

26
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:57,296
     <i> Caller, say your name.</i>

27
00:04:57,298 --> 00:05:00,299
            <i> - David.</i>
        <i> - Do you accept?</i>

28
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:01,900
              Yes.

29
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,738
           Hey, Dad.
          Is Jo there?

30
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,073
         <i> No, she's not.</i>

31
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:10,409
       Would you like me
     to give her a message?

32
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:15,080
        No, never mind.
     I wrote her a letter.

33
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:16,581
  <i> When are you gonna come home</i>

34
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,684
         and take care
     of your business, son?

35
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:21,320
       Okay, well, uh...
          I gotta go.

36
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:24,056
   <i> - I'll try it later then.</i>
    - Listen to me, if you--

37
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,610
      <i> So what do you want</i>
   <i> to study in school today?</i>

38
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,646
         <i> Sea monsters.</i>

39
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,648
          <i> Sea monsters</i>
       <i> are not a subject.</i>

40
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,084
     <i> Let's do math instead.</i>

41
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:54,653
             <i> Okay.</i>

42
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,755
      <i> I'm nine years old,</i>
         <i> and you're 27.</i>

43
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:58,423
           <i> Yes, sir.</i>

44
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,959
    <i> That means you were 18</i>
        <i> when you had me.</i>

45
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:04,496
     <i> Yeah, well, let's not</i>
     <i> do math today either.</i>

46
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:06,665
  <i> Why don't we study science?</i>

47
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,500
      <i> We can do dinosaurs.</i>

48
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:11,536
     <i> How about prehistoric</i>
         <i> sea creatures?</i>

49
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,506
          <i> Okay, fine.</i>
    <i> So long as they're real.</i>

50
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:16,074
       Which one's this?

51
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:19,644
      Predator X, which is
 a pliosaur with 12-inch teeth.

52
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,880
    So was that the baddest
     creature in the ocean?

53
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:25,784
   Some people say this one's
   the baddest, a megalodon.

54
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:28,553
    But pliosaurs are cooler
          than sharks,

55
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,857
       and the megalodon
     only had 8-inch teeth.

56
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,458
       Do you think there
     was really an asteroid

57
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,926
        that killed them
      like that book says?

58
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,628
          I guess so.

59
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,163
        Well, you know,
      I think that's dumb.

60
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,132
   I don't think an asteroid
     can destroy everything

61
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:41,833
  that's on the whole planet.

62
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,669
       I don't even think
  a nuclear bomb can do that.

63
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,805
  We dropped a couple of those
   on Japan in World War II,

64
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,473
   and it didn't do nothing.

65
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:52,411
I still got a radio from the 90s
    that was made in Japan.

66
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:53,945
   But they say that asteroid

67
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:57,449
  was a million times stronger
       than an atom bomb.

68
00:06:57,451 --> 00:07:00,719
         - Hey, hombre!
      - What's up, Curtis?

69
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:01,853
       What's up, buddy?

70
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,855
         - Hey, Curtis.
           - Hi, Jo.

71
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,957
  - We got a question for you.
            - Okay.

72
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,059
       What do you think
     killed the dinosaurs?

73
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,864
 Well, there was a polar shift,

74
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:15,200
      and Earth's magnets
         got reversed.

75
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:17,769
 It went from being 80 degrees

76
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:21,039
      to like 500 degrees
         in the shade,

77
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,874
      and they all melted
        and became tar.

78
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:26,178
  That's where oil comes from.
         Fossil fuels.

79
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,982
     Now we fight wars over
  dead dinosaurs... and drugs.

80
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,718
  - Probably right about that.
        - I totally am.

81
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,020
         Let me guess.
     You want a yellow one?

82
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:37,522
Yes, and some birdseed, please.

83
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:40,492
  You know, you don't have to
   buy the parakeet, Curtis.

84
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:42,160
      I know, but you know
         what they say.

85
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:43,795
 When in Rome, do as Romans do.

86
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,798
    Shit in the pope's hat.
      Something like that.

87
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,469
     Well, here's your, uh,
           medicine.

88
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:52,604
       - Thank you, Doc.
           - Mm-hmm.

89
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:56,141
   The FDA would not approve.

90
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,611
         But screw 'em.
     This is a pilgrimage.

91
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,780
     - What's a pilgrimage?
          - Precisely.

92
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:03,548
  This day in modern medicine

93
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,517
    has made the pilgrimage
        an anachronism.

94
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,652
     Kind of like a spider
   or something? A tarantula?

95
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:13,058
  No, yeah, an old one that's
out of fashion, lost its touch.

96
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,626
  How many birds you got now?

97
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:15,794
         Just this one.

98
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,231
       And just a little
     something extra for...

99
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:21,733
       I don't take money
      for the medication.

100
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,603
  - Extra for the beautiful--
       - I don't do that.

101
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:26,838
     It's for the beautiful
         parakeet, Jo.

102
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,907
     It's my favorite one.

103
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,709
          Bye, Curtis.

104
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,010
           Bye, girl.

105
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,181
              Bye!

106
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,783
            Woo-hoo!

107
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:54,799
            Woo-hoo!

108
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,941
      - Got you something.
          - Thank you.

109
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:04,576
   Thank the jellybean stalk.

110
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:06,978
           Thank you,
        jellybean stalk!

111
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,148
              Ohh!

112
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,284
             Whee!

113
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,862
          - Hey, Mark.
             - Hey.

114
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:26,631
        - Hey, Grandpa.
         - Hey, buddy.

115
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:27,732
         - You hungry?
            - Yeah.

116
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,035
   Grandma's cooking dinner.

117
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:34,706
      She got some of that
  chicken casserole you love.

118
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,208
    Hey, Johnathan, will you
     take that stuff inside

119
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,210
   and then go help Grandma?

120
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,179
- Grandpa and I are gonna talk.
            - Okay.

121
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:42,948
   We'll see you in a minute,
             buddy.

122
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:45,817
           What's up?

123
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:48,687
      Well, David called.

124
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,722
        - What'd he say?
          - Not much.

125
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:55,961
   I told him you'd had your
   electricity disconnected.

126
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:57,862
              And?

127
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:02,634
   Well, he asked me if it'd
   be okay if you moved home.

128
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:08,340
          - I am home.
     - No. I mean with us.

129
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:18,083
 Well, it's a good thing Linda
  wants that as much as I do.

130
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:22,721
   Sweetheart, I don't think
       he's coming back.

131
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:32,030
 Linda says she's fine to have
     Johnathan stay with us

132
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,866
        till things get
    a little better for you.

133
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,704
  She doesn't think I can take
    care of my own son, huh?

134
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,640
       I didn't say that.

135
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:53,084
   Are you gonna have dinner
        with us or what?

136
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:54,819
            JoLynn!

137
00:10:56,222 --> 00:11:00,425
        - Hey, Grandma.
 - Hey. Let me see your hands.

138
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:04,129
    Oh, Lord, go wash those
      mud mitts right now.

139
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,331
     No, no, no, not there.
      I'm preparing food.

140
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,999
      Go to the bathroom.

141
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:11,069
   And don't touch anything!

142
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:13,738
        Fingernails too.

143
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,043
     Is your mom giving you
       your eye medicine?

144
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:20,311
       Yeah, twice a day.

145
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,716
          Straighten.

146
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:26,451
           Oh, go on.

147
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,455
         Hey, Grandpa,
   will you tell me the story

148
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:35,126
     about the sea monster
          in the lake?

149
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:40,098
 Okay. We were dropping anchor,
    and this green ensign--

150
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,866
     Now, when I say green,

151
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,769
      I mean greener than
      a bullfrog's nipple,

152
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:47,806
    greener than them beans
       right there, okay?

153
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,974
  Has no idea what he's doing.

154
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:52,343
    He's letting that chain
    run out into the ocean,

155
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:56,748
 and that chain has links on it
       that are this big.

156
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,750
     So before we know it,

157
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:01,953
       that guy is ripped
      clean off the deck,

158
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:05,924
and the only thing sitting there
        is a severed leg

159
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:10,095
      and a trail of blood
  leading straight overboard.

160
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:12,163
            - Whoa.
    - Have we heard enough?

161
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,032
          No, Grandma,
     this is the best part.

162
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:17,202
 Now, you eat those vegetables,
       and I'll continue.

163
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:21,372
    So now I have to dive in
  to try to retrieve the body.

164
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:23,508
   I mean, for proper burial,
             right?

165
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,477
 How did you know he was dead?

166
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:31,449
  'Cause I had to swim through
  a cloud of blood and sharks.

167
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,518
    Did the sharks eat him?

168
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,221
     Probably. I don't know
 'cause I never found the body.

169
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:41,426
     It was too dangerous,
  so I just froze and watched.

170
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:45,463
      And all of a sudden,
 up from below came something.

171
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:49,434
      I swear I don't know
          what it was,

172
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:53,371
      but it had these big
    tentacles that came down

173
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:57,509
 and wrapped themselves around
  this full-grown tiger shark

174
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:59,978
          like it was
    a little bitty football.

175
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,546
     Was it a giant squid?

176
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:04,783
   Maybe, but it jetted back
       into the deep blue

177
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,951
       before I could get
       a good look at it.

178
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,821
    I will promise you this,
            though.

179
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:13,091
        There is nothing
      in the entire ocean

180
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:19,130
 that would ever stand a chance
 against a creature like that.

181
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,432
    All right, are we done?

182
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,501
    'Cause I have completely
       lost my appetite.

183
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:26,070
       Can I be excused?

184
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,806
      <i> Can</i> you be excused?

185
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,908
       <i> May</i> I be excused?

186
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,543
             Fine.

187
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,079
              Hey.

188
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,581
        What do you say?

189
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,216
      Thank you, Grandma.

190
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:40,952
        You're welcome.
          I love you.

191
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:42,587
         Love you too.
         Bye, Grandpa.

192
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,255
         Bye, Captain.

193
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:51,196
         Can you please
         pass the salt?

194
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,133
         Pretty please?

195
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:57,235
    With shark guts on top.

196
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,925
- Hey, baby, what's the matter?
        - My head hurts.

197
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,494
     Let me see your eyes.

198
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:26,030
  Here, lie down. I'll get you
      some medicine, okay?

199
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,237
       Here, baby, here.

200
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:35,039
    Come lie on Mama's lap.

201
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,941
         Come lie down.

202
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,312
          Chew it up.
 The pressure's gonna go down.

203
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:43,081
   It hurts real bad tonight.

204
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,183
            I know.
   Just hang in there, okay?

205
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,519
       Just keep chewing.

206
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,045
           Johnathan!

207
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:51,683
           Johnathan!

208
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,319
Ah!

209
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:55,553
            No! No!

210
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,255
           Johnathan,
      no, no, no, no, no!

211
00:15:57,257 --> 00:16:00,024
              No!

212
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:03,328
Come on! Grandpa's gonna be here
      in a couple minutes.

213
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,963
       Go get cleaned up.

214
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,101
   I got a favor to ask you.

215
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:11,736
           Ask away.

216
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:18,109
    It's kinda hired for me,
         but I'm, uh...

217
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:20,111
      I'm a little behind
          on my rent.

218
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:23,448
            Oh, boy.
        How far behind?

219
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,318
      About three months.

220
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,487
         Three months?

221
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:33,157
       Good Lord, JoLynn.

222
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,594
 You know I'd love to help you,
but I gotta be honest with you.

223
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:39,030
    The way they've cut back
         my retirement,

224
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:42,433
          we just flat
     don't have it, honey.

225
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:49,507
 When David called, did he say
     he wasn't coming back?

226
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:55,546
    He didn't say anything.

227
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:59,550
          I don't know
      what he's gonna do.

228
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:03,187
       That's the truth.

229
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:08,226
  Honey, I will do everything
     I can to help you out.

230
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:11,629
       Okay? No promises.

231
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,464
            Thanks.

232
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:20,038
         - You all set?
           - Mm-hmm.

233
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,111
   His headaches have gotten
          a lot worse.

234
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:30,214
 He's been sick to his stomach
             a lot.

235
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,816
       Johnathan, please.

236
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:36,187
I know the trab was our big hope
   after the laser surgeries,

237
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:40,558
but often it takes more than one
procedure to lower the pressure.

238
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,529
   With glaucoma, many times
   surgeries just don't work.

239
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:47,298
 Now, you and your husband need
     to prepare yourselves

240
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,435
  for the fact that Johnathan
   may just need to take meds

241
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:53,404
   for the rest of his life.

242
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,340
  So the drops are working to
  control the pressure spikes?

243
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:58,576
   Yeah, they make his vision
         blurry though.

244
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,245
  He complained about-- Well,
  he complains about it a lot.

245
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,347
  Well, he needs them though.

246
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:05,716
     You need to make sure
         he takes them.

247
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:08,352
 After that allergic reaction,
   he's afraid of the drops.

248
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:10,588
       I'm gonna keep him
        on the myotics.

249
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,290
      The spikes are just
         too dangerous.

250
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:15,259
    I'm going to have to add
       an oral inhibitor,

251
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,295
   and we'll see how he does.

252
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:19,764
     Contact me immediately

253
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,400
       if he experiences
    any shortness of breath.

254
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:24,669
      Now, my adding these
        may make him...

255
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:28,339
    a little tired and weak,
    just a little sluggish.

256
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:31,342
But that could be good for you.

257
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:33,544
     Boys can be a handful.

258
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,516
     You ready, Johnathan?
           Let's go.

259
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,863
Can I go check the fishing lines
     at Mr. Upshaw's pond?

260
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:54,198
       Yeah, that's fine.
  Just don't get caught, okay?

261
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,801
         - No swimming.
         - Yes, ma'am.

262
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,607
  I got to go give her a hand
         in the garden.

263
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:05,443
     This is how I maintain
      my girlish physique.

264
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:06,744
           Hey, Mark?

265
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,813
             Yeah.

266
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,249
    Thank you for taking us
      to the doctor today.

267
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:13,251
           Of course.

268
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:16,347
    You know as well as I do
 that those are not hog tracks.

269
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:18,616
 You know where they came from.

270
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:20,918
   Did you talk to Johnathan?

271
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,987
      Yeah. He denies it.

272
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:25,856
     Seemed a little dodgy
         to me though.

273
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:28,292
       If she would just
    keep an eye on that boy,

274
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:30,861
     teach him some respect
         for property.

275
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:33,764
          Don't start.

276
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:36,734
   What are these doing out?

277
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:05,363
       It's okay, fishy.

278
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:08,733
     I'm here to save you,
    so Mommy don't eat you.

279
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,671
          Hah! Gotcha!

280
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:16,974
         I don't think
     you taste good anyway.

281
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:22,947
 Johnathan, you went swimming.

282
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,582
       Come on, let's go.

283
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:26,651
     - Where are we going?
      - We're going home.

284
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:28,653
        But we're going
    to Grandma's for dinner.

285
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:30,855
  Look, I don't want you going
   to Grandma's again, okay?

286
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:32,623
       - Not without me.
             - Why?

287
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,692
       Because I said so.

288
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:39,797
   Look, she's pissed because
you keep breaking all her stuff.

289
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,733
       I didn't mean to.

290
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:44,735
        I know, I know.

291
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:47,605
     It's just shit anyway.

292
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:50,541
        The whole house
        is full of shit.

293
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:52,877
 We're not going there anymore.

294
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:59,684
Look, I'm gonna take care of you
       from now on, okay?

295
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:02,053
     Till Daddy comes back.

296
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:03,821
             Okay.

297
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:07,825
            Come on.

298
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,094
    From now on, nobody can
    come in the house, okay?

299
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:12,663
            Nobody.

300
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,800
           Especially
      Grandma and Grandpa.

301
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:20,104
         - You hear me?
         - Yes, ma'am.

302
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,348
Go!

303
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:34,719
            1, 2...

304
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:38,356
            3, 4...

305
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:41,025
         I can't do it
   if you don't hold my feet.

306
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:45,596
         - Hey, JoLynn!
    - Oh, God. It's Natalie.

307
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:49,567
     Hey! Sorry to drop in
          unannounced.

308
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:51,469
  What happened to your phone?

309
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:54,638
  - Oh, it just got shut off.
 - Oh, well, ain't that shitty.

310
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,774
        Hey, Johnathan,
      looking like a stud.

311
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:58,843
       Hey, Aunt Natalie.

312
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:00,978
Hey, I wanna tell you something.

313
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:05,416
  Hey, 20 more minutes of P.E.
        while we visit.

314
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,137
         Wee Wee, help!

315
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:28,572
Come on,
   you never get out anymore.

316
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,041
 I know, but I can't just leave
   Johnathan here by himself.

317
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:32,843
  He can take care of himself.

318
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:34,912
     I mean, really, what's
   the worst that can happen?

319
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:39,049
    A pig get in your house?
 It wouldn't be the first time.

320
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:43,020
           All right.

321
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,961
  Hey, if me and Aunt Natalie
       went out tonight,

322
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:53,431
      - would you be good?
         - Yes, ma'am.

323
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:54,965
  And I don't want you to let
     Wee Wee in the house,

324
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,500
      and I don't want you
    going down to Grandpa's.

325
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:57,835
             Okay.

326
00:23:57,837 --> 00:23:59,036
           All right,
   I'll pick you up at 8:00.

327
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:01,639
        - Bye, sweetie.
             - Bye.

328
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:02,840
     Where are y'all going?

329
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:04,909
        Get rent money.

330
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:15,619
             <i> G-49.</i>

331
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,655
Hey, are you sure
         he's got this?

332
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:21,859
Relax. We can't lose.
  He's like a computer genius.

333
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:25,062
   Hi. We need six computers
        split two ways.

334
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:28,566
          That's $90.
      It'll be 45 apiece.

335
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:30,134
      Natalie, that's all
      the money I've got.

336
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:32,036
      Okay. Stop bitching.

337
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:35,206
  Pretty soon we are gonna be
      splitting jackpots.

338
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:37,074
<i> First number out</i>
<i>will determine the wild number,</i>

339
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:38,776
   <i> and it's gonna be a nine.</i>

340
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:41,645
        Oh, there he is.

341
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,582

    <i> ending in 9 through 69.</i>

342
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:46,083
         - Hey, cowboy.
         - Hey, ladies.

343
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:47,985
       - This is JoLynn.
        - Looking good!

344
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,488
  - Nice to meet you, JoLynn.
 - Hey, it's nice to meet you.

345
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,156
     What have we got here?

346
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:56,093
   Good. Bingo Bill gave you
    lucky number six for me.

347
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:58,696
       That's my hot box.

348
00:24:58,698 --> 00:25:00,097
       Are y'all feeling
      the fortune tonight?

349
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:03,200
          - Oh, yeah.
           - Me too.

350
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:07,771
       Now, let me go do
whatever it is I do, all right?

351
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:14,278
           I told you
      he was cute as hell.

352
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:22,119
          Here you go.

353
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:24,588
   Don't tell Mama, Wee Wee.

354
00:26:03,296 --> 00:26:07,831
       Bad pig! Bad pig!
   You're a naughty pig! Bad!

            <i> - G-49.</i>
       <i> -</i> Damn it. I'm on.

356
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:03,387
          Come on, 63!
           Or an 18.

357
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:05,389
              <i> B5.</i>

             Sorry.

361
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:23,073
        - It's a winner.
    <i> - We have a good bingo.</i>

362
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:25,009
        - What the hell?
 - Look, I'm sorry, all right?

363
00:27:25,011 --> 00:27:26,276
   No! You said we had this!

364
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,045
           You'd pull
     your dumb-ass strings.

365
00:27:28,047 --> 00:27:29,713
    You really think I could
     rig a damn bingo game?

366
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:30,814
   Are you that damn stupid?

367
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,150
         What is this,
        some shit line?

368
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:36,286
       Look, I got lucky.
       Sorry you didn't.

369
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:39,323
     - You son of a bitch.
          - Natalie...

370
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:42,926
        Get out of here,
        you trashy ass.

371
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:44,228
          - Hey, hey!
       - Don't touch me.

372
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,996
   Oh, one whore sticking up
          for another?

373
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,399
      - That's my sister.
 - Oh, must run in the family.

374
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:50,300
      You don't know shit
        about my family.

375
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:52,369
   Oh, I don't? What's that?
  Bet your husband has no idea

376
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:54,938
 you're out here whoring it up
at a bingo parlor for a dollar.

377
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,306
            Please.

378
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:58,375
 Yeah, give me a call sometime.
        We can do that.

379
00:27:58,377 --> 00:27:59,977
 - Your sister's got my number.
           - Get out.

380
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:01,145
      I got it, I got it.

381
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:03,814
    Sorry about that, y'all.
             Bitch.

382
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,917
       Sorry. It's cool.

383
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:13,023
  Oh, look at these tomatoes.
     Oh, they look so ripe.

384
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,059
       Yeah! Tomato guts!

385
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,463
          Tomato man!

386
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,911
        So how's David?

387
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:37,247
         I don't know.
          You tell me.

388
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:40,184
    I haven't heard from him
        in over a month.

389
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:42,953
       I haven't either.

390
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:46,123
 Mark offered for us to move in
      with him and Linda.

391
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:48,759
        - Why don't you?
      - What do you think?

392
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:51,428
    - Till David comes back.
         - Oh, please.

393
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,430
 Hey, at least the man's trying
 to do something with his life.

394
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:55,099
        It's about time.

395
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:58,001
     - Yeah, must be nice.
     - At least you got one

396
00:28:58,003 --> 00:29:00,871
that's trying to make something
    out of himself for you.

397
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:03,173
         Must be nice.

398
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:07,778
    David asked you to call
  and check on me, didn't he?

399
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:11,949
  He leaves me for two months
   with nothing but a letter,

400
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:12,983
       but he calls you?

401
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:14,885
    You don't got no phone.

402
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:17,421
   Well, I'm not the one that
  racked up a $500 phone bill,

403
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:18,989
         booking a tour
 all over kingdom come either.

404
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:20,357
    I'm just trying to help.
           Chill out.

405
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:23,026
    Help? You just helped me
     lose everything I had.

406
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:25,462
   You think I wanted to drag
your lame ass out of the house?

407
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:27,097
       Then why did you?

408
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,867
      You never come over
   unless you want something.

409
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:32,870
    Maybe I just don't want
  to see you end up like Mom.

410
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:35,305
   You really think I'm gonna
     drink myself to death

411
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:37,174
    - because a man left me?
 - I don't know what you'd do.

412
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:40,410
       You've always been
  the depressed, serious type.

413
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:44,081
 Maybe if you relaxed for once,
 you could find someone better.

414
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:45,482
         - More coffee?
      - Yeah, fill 'er up.

415
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:48,118
      She likes it black.

416
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,420
     Get a new wig, bitch.

417
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:52,790
          Kiss my ass!

418
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:59,029
       Ow. Stupid thing.
            Come on!

419
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,348
              Hey!

420
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,987
          Go, Wee Wee!

421
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,190
          Go, go, go!
          Go, go, go!

422
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:27,891
            Woo-hoo!

423
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:35,332
         I'm so sorry.

424
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:38,602
    I will talk to Johnathan
        in the morning.

425
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:41,972
            No. No.

426
00:30:41,974 --> 00:30:44,308
      No, this time you're
      gonna do something.

427
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,410
   What do you want me to do?

428
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:49,847
 You let her run all over you,
      and now her boy too.

429
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:54,618
  Why don't you do something?
    They're your family too.

430
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,620
       All right, I will.

431
00:30:56,622 --> 00:30:59,389
            - Good.
  - I will take care of this.

432
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:22,913
         What the hell?
           Johnathan!

433
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:25,449
     Wee Wee, what are you
         doing in here?

434
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:26,950
          Oh, my God.

435
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,958
           Johnathan!

436
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,570
           Johnathan!

437
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,440
   What the hell, Johnathan?

438
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:52,910
 What did you do to my plants?

439
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:55,445
   I wanted to make brownies.

440
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:58,148
       Are you an idiot?
     Why would you do that?

441
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,318
    - That's your medicine!
        - I don't know.

442
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,987
  It's a gonna take me months
       to grow 'em back!

443
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,266
             Fuck!

444
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:45,295
         Can I come in?

445
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,245
   I'm sorry I yelled at you.

446
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:08,685
        I'm sorry, Mama.
   I don't know why I did it.

447
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,758
           You did it
      'cause you're a kid.

448
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:22,299
    I keep asking you to be
      a man for me, but...

449
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:25,335
   you just need to be a kid.

450
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:33,210
          I miss Dad.

451
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:35,212
            Me too.

452
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:46,123
     You'll never leave me,
           will you?

453
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:52,129
    I will never leave you.

454
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:56,066
          I love you.

455
00:33:56,068 --> 00:34:00,237
         I will always,
        always love you.

456
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:03,106
        No matter what.

457
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:06,610
           No matter
     what you become and...

458
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:10,247
    no matter if you grow up
       and do bad things.

459
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:16,286
        I will love you
      more than God does.

460
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,863
  - Sheriff Cole, you're back.
      - I'm sorry, JoLynn.

461
00:34:59,865 --> 00:35:01,565
       How come with all
     the deputies you got,

462
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:02,866
  you come see me personally?

463
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:04,801
    Could you step outside,
            please?

464
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:06,736
      I'm fine right here,
           thank you.

465
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,475
      Well, I need to know
       where your pig is.

466
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:13,310
      How come you asking?

467
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:15,512
      Well, your neighbor
      down the hill here,

468
00:35:15,514 --> 00:35:17,247
      they pressed charges
         this morning.

469
00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:19,149
          My neighbor?
  That's my husband's parents.

470
00:35:19,151 --> 00:35:23,620
 I understand that, JoLynn, but
 I have to issue you a citation

471
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:27,457
 for trespassing and vandalism
  perpetrated by your pet pig.

472
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,726
I know.

473
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:31,261
            Come on.

474
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:42,439
  I'm also gonna need to know
  the whereabouts of your pig,

475
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,207
           currently.

476
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:45,675
  Well, you're looking at her.

477
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:49,646
       Where-- God dang!
   That's not funny, JoLynn!

478
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:52,215
  I'm gonna tell you something
 right now, and I mean it too.

479
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:54,784
     You contain your pig,
           all right?

480
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:57,320
If I catch him off the premises
         one more time,

481
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,823
    I'm gonna confiscate and
 the euthanize the damn thing.

482
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:03,927
        That's bullshit!
      Ham and egg bastard.

483
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:06,663
      Pig shit everywhere.
       Get away from me!

484
00:36:14,473 --> 00:36:17,240
        Ham hock-lookin'
        son of a bitch.

485
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,313
              Yah!

486
00:36:32,224 --> 00:36:33,356
Hey.

487
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:39,663
   Well, Linda, they gave me
   a $250 ticket. You happy?

488
00:36:39,665 --> 00:36:41,298
     I didn't want for you
        to get a ticket.

489
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,766
     Well, then why did you
      call the cops on me?

490
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:44,768
 I wanted to make a statement.

491
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:48,238
      Well, I'm here now.
   Make your damn statement.

492
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,974
       Say what you want
         to say to me.

493
00:36:50,976 --> 00:36:53,210
            - Okay.
           - Say it!

494
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:55,312
    You need to get your kid
         under control.

495
00:36:55,314 --> 00:36:57,514
      And maybe you should
    teach him not to steal,

496
00:36:57,516 --> 00:36:59,783
 while you're homeschooling him
    sub-kindergarten skills.

497
00:36:59,785 --> 00:37:01,685
 Kind of like you did your son?

498
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:04,654
    The one that walked out
         on his family?

499
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:07,357
    At least I teach my son
  to be a human fucking being!

500
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,259
That's enough. Outside.

501
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:10,827
      You gonna run me out
     like a little dog now?

502
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:14,464
       Get outside. Now.
            Come on.

503
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:19,336
           - Damn it!
  - Will you please calm down?

504
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:21,571
   She doesn't like the fact
that I'm a high school dropout,

505
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,006
 and I'm homeschooling my son,

506
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:24,574
      but yet he can't see
      the damn chalkboard.

507
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,543
 I need to tell you something.

508
00:37:26,545 --> 00:37:28,778
No! You know, she's refusing to
 accept that he's going blind,

509
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,347
       even though she's
     constantly complaining

510
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:31,615
       that he's breaking
        her little shit.

511
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:34,784
   Shush! Let me talk, okay?

512
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:37,754
  Wee Wee just didn't get into
     her garden last night.

513
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,023
    Johnathan led her there.

514
00:37:40,025 --> 00:37:43,560
      Tore the whole thing
           to pieces.

515
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:45,262
         - You saw him?
            - Yeah.

516
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:48,331
 I fired a shot up into the air
        to run him off.

517
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:52,936
    You have got to get this
 situation under control, okay?

518
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:55,972
      If you can't afford
   to pay rent or utilities,

519
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:59,909
   you damn sure can't afford
 to feed a 300-pound nuisance.

520
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:02,646
    David gave him that pig.
         He loves her.

521
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:06,383
        A full-grown pig
         is not a pet.

522
00:38:06,385 --> 00:38:09,052
         You wanna tell
      your grandson that?

523
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:12,856
       No. I'm not trying
    to tell you what to do.

524
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:16,626
      I'm just saying that
    with your circumstance,

525
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:20,330
    you have got to explore
         some options.

526
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,534
           Come here.

527
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:26,770
     I gotta go. I'm sorry.

528
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:47,324
         - Who's there?
       - Uh, it's JoLynn.

529
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:54,664
       - Hey, buddy. Hi.
         - Hey, Curtis.

530
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,666
        I was just, uh,
      I was just riffing.

531
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,769
      I got cooler songs.
   I was just riffing around.

532
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:01,971
  - Do you mind if we come in?
 - Please, please, come on in.

533
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:04,908
         - Come on in.
     - You got a fish tank?

534
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,010
     Yeah, yeah, saltwater.

535
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,115
     Where's all the fish?

536
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:15,352
       There's just one.
  I used to call him Neptune.

537
00:39:15,354 --> 00:39:18,488
  - Now I call him Inept-tune.
   - What kind of fish is he?

538
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,957
He's an octo-wuss. Might as well
    be a chocolate starfish.

539
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:23,059
       He's a shit fish.
       You never see him.

540
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:25,428
     He just hides all day.

541
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:28,365
     But<i> that</i> is Plisskin.

542
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:30,033
     He's a total bad ass,

543
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:31,835
    always trying to escape
           and shit.

544
00:39:31,837 --> 00:39:35,939
        But breaking out
         is impossible.

545
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:39,109
     Breaking in is insane.

546
00:39:39,111 --> 00:39:41,544
  That is Peter North Parker,

547
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:45,115
you know, 'cause he's a spider,
 man, he's just so big and all.

548
00:39:45,117 --> 00:39:47,751
    And this is Claws Meine.

549
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:50,820
   Let me show you something.
        Check this out.

550
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:57,861
  That is love at first sting,
          right there.

551
00:39:57,863 --> 00:40:00,497
       Yoohoo! Johnathan!

552
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:02,165
         He is obsessed
        with the ocean.

553
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:05,168
  If you had a shark in there,
     he would never leave.

554
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,904
  - Johnathan, you like music?
             - Hmm?

555
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:10,006
       - You like music?
           - Mm-hmm.

556
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:12,108
        Check this out.

557
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,878
 Some dude in Austin gave this
   to me for a bag of weed--

558
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,915
        Uh, weed killer.
     Said it was an import.

559
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:24,187
         You like this?

560
00:40:24,189 --> 00:40:26,122
        I don't like it.

561
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:27,824
           I<i> love</i> it!

562
00:40:27,826 --> 00:40:29,659
       Well, it's yours.
            Take it.

563
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:33,563
  - Can I listen to it first?
   - Of course! All you want.

564
00:40:33,565 --> 00:40:35,698
      You wanna go outside
           for a sec?

565
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,100
            - Yeah.
            - Okay.

566
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:40,570
     Okay. Hey, Johnathan,
     make yourself at home.

567
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,547
           All of it?

568
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:53,016
             All of it.

569
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:56,553
       Shit. I only have
      a week's worth left.

570
00:40:56,555 --> 00:40:59,656
          All I got's
     a couple days' worth.

571
00:40:59,658 --> 00:41:01,991
  What about his regular meds?

572
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:04,794
        I told you about
   the complications he has.

573
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,230
    He just responds better
          to the hydro

574
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:09,966
       than he does with
    the pharmaceutical crap.

575
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:13,236
 The only guy I know is Lonny.

576
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:15,939
 He only sells a quarter pound.

577
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:18,608
   I can't afford that much.

578
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,710
       We can go in half.

579
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:23,646
  I can't afford that either.

580
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,648
         Maybe I could
        sell some shit.

581
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,551
     Ratshot owes me some.

582
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:32,856
        Oh, it's too bad
       we live in Texas.

583
00:41:32,858 --> 00:41:36,960
    If we were on the coast,
hydro would be doctor's orders.

584
00:41:36,962 --> 00:41:38,761
             Yeah.

585
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:45,235
   Man, you ever think about
         leaving Texas?

586
00:41:45,237 --> 00:41:48,538
       I don't know, man.
        I like it here.

587
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,073
  In Texas, you may have shit,

588
00:41:50,075 --> 00:41:51,908
     but you'll always have
         your dignity.

589
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:54,878
Here, you can throw your head in
 a toilet bowl, lick it clean,

590
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,146
   that'll at least make you
   the baddest son of a bitch

591
00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:59,215
          in the room.

592
00:41:59,217 --> 00:42:00,850
    How do you figure that?

593
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:03,953
the Alamo.

594
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:07,090
Which reminds me, you wanna see
my dad's most prized possession?

595
00:42:07,092 --> 00:42:08,892
         I don't know.
          What is it?

596
00:42:08,894 --> 00:42:11,027
      I'll be right back.

597
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:55,705
    My old man never let me
    listen to Ozzy Osbourne

598
00:42:55,707 --> 00:42:58,241
       because he pissed
         on the Alamo.

599
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:01,311
    You'd think Ozzy pissed
     on his mother's grave,

600
00:43:01,313 --> 00:43:03,913
   he's so serious about it.

601
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:08,785
        Check this out.

602
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:19,629
          What is it?

603
00:43:19,631 --> 00:43:25,768
 That is an actual musket ball
        from the Alamo.

604
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:29,372
           Seriously?

605
00:43:29,374 --> 00:43:31,207
            Hell no!

606
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:33,276
   It's an old fishing weight
        I hammered down.

607
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:36,012
    I told him it was pried
 from Colonel Travis's bedroom.

608
00:43:36,014 --> 00:43:39,282
  He's so proud of that, you'd
think it was Bowie's own blade.

609
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:42,051
  I just don't have the balls
      to break his heart,

610
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:44,654
    tell him the truth now.

611
00:43:44,656 --> 00:43:46,689
  That's really awful, Curtis.

612
00:43:46,691 --> 00:43:51,260
  Aw, the old bastard's happy.
    That's all that matters.

613
00:43:51,262 --> 00:43:53,696
    I wonder how many times
   I've been lied to by a man

614
00:43:53,698 --> 00:43:55,832
     just to make me happy.

615
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:03,172
     Well, he'd be a fool.

616
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:09,812
             Shit.

617
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:11,714
      I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm--
           I'm sorry.

618
00:44:11,716 --> 00:44:14,884
     No, that's-- I mean--
         No, it's fine.

619
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:17,120
             Uh...

620
00:44:17,122 --> 00:44:19,322
     No. I should probably
         go check on...

621
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:21,958
       check on Johnathan
          anyway, huh?

622
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:25,928
             Shit.

623
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:28,931
          Johnathan...

624
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:31,134
            - What?
     - What are you doing?

625
00:44:31,136 --> 00:44:34,103
    I'm looking for Neptune,
     but I can't find him.

626
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:36,739
        I'm telling you
      he's the shyest pet.

627
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,846
       You'll never find
    that lazy water bastard.

628
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,214
      Johnathan, let's go.

629
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,957
<i> Guess what I did today?</i>

630
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:57,694
         <i> It was a baby,</i>
   <i> but it was the real thing.</i>

631
00:44:57,696 --> 00:45:01,197
   <i> The mom's still out there.</i>

632
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:03,199
  <i> Sorry you couldn't be there,</i>

633
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:07,236
   <i> but Grandpa says a hunter</i>
 <i> takes a shot once he has him.</i>

634
00:45:07,238 --> 00:45:09,238
      <i> We have to celebrate</i>
        <i> with jellybeans.</i>

635
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,473
          Jellybeans!

636
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:17,280
           Mmm, good.

637
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,883
  Nothing like those old ones.

638
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,000
             - Hey.
            - What?

639
00:46:44,002 --> 00:46:46,936
     - What are you doing?
- Looking for something to eat.

640
00:46:46,938 --> 00:46:49,939
    Well, go play, and I'll
     make something to eat.

641
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,201
     Johnathan! No, no, no.

642
00:47:18,203 --> 00:47:20,169
    Wait, wait, wait, wait!

643
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:22,505
       Hey, you can't use
     the bathroom anymore.

644
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:23,873
              Why?

645
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:25,107
      Just don't, please.

646
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:27,610
        If you gotta go,
     go out back like Dad.

647
00:47:27,612 --> 00:47:31,581
  If you gotta go number two,
 then just go behind the shed.

648
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,316
    Look, I'm serious, okay?

649
00:47:33,318 --> 00:47:37,420
   Go play, and I'll make us
      some oatmeal. Go on.

650
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:06,182
  Did you put any sugar in it?

651
00:48:06,184 --> 00:48:08,150
      We're out of sugar,
      thank you very much.

652
00:48:08,152 --> 00:48:10,553
  You got any jellybeans left?

653
00:48:10,555 --> 00:48:12,121
             Yeah.

654
00:48:12,123 --> 00:48:15,091
           All right,
      put those in there.

655
00:48:15,093 --> 00:48:17,326
             Gross.

656
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:23,165
 Why can't we go to Grandpa's?

657
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:26,235
   Because I told you not to.

658
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:33,209
     I don't want no more.

659
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:12,248
     Can I play a song now?

660
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,450
        After we finish
       your scales, okay?

661
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:15,718
      All right, D-minor.

662
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:20,623
             - Hi.
    - She made me pull over

663
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,692
   to look at the parakeets.

664
00:49:22,694 --> 00:49:24,593
        No, that's fine.
     They make great pets.

665
00:49:24,595 --> 00:49:27,129
 No, she won't be getting one.
I would have to take care of it.

666
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:29,165
Oh.

667
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:30,733
          Hey, Julie.

668
00:49:30,735 --> 00:49:33,169
      No, I couldn't open
        the attachment.

669
00:49:33,171 --> 00:49:35,171
        They're pretty!
          I want one!

670
00:49:35,173 --> 00:49:37,440
     You don't take care of
   your puppy or the turtle.

671
00:49:37,442 --> 00:49:39,542
       The puppy is ugly
    and poops on the floor.

672
00:49:39,544 --> 00:49:43,145
      Turtles are stupid.
       I want a parakeet!

673
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:44,580
     Which one do you like,
            sweetie?

674
00:49:44,582 --> 00:49:47,049
    - No, Kimmie, let's go.
      - I want a blue one.

675
00:49:47,051 --> 00:49:48,317
       I got yellow ones.

676
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,052
          I don't want
      a stupid yellow one!

677
00:49:50,054 --> 00:49:51,654
      - I want a blue one!
     - Hold on one second.

678
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:53,622
    Kimmie's about to throw
          a hurricane.

679
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:56,058
          I don't have
      any blue ones here,

680
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:57,760
        but I just live
      right up the street.

681
00:49:57,762 --> 00:49:59,028
        We could go get
        a couple there.

682
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:00,596
  She has a blue one at home!

683
00:50:00,598 --> 00:50:03,032
       Pick one of these
 if you want one, and let's go.

684
00:50:04,736 --> 00:50:07,003
       Stop it! Stop it!

685
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:09,372
     Stop it right now! No!

686
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:11,340
          Stop it! No!

687
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:17,079
   Why do your eyes do this?

688
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:19,281
        I have nystagmus
         and glaucoma.

689
00:50:19,283 --> 00:50:20,649
              Eww.

690
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:22,251
     Want some jellybeans?

691
00:50:22,253 --> 00:50:23,753
             Sure.

692
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:28,758
           Hey, Mama,
     you want a jellybean?

693
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,427
         No, thank you.

694
00:50:31,429 --> 00:50:34,263
      Hey, why'd you take
         my jellybeans?

695
00:50:34,265 --> 00:50:36,098
Come on, Kim!

696
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,233
             Okay.

697
00:50:44,674 --> 00:50:46,542
            Uh, Kim?

698
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:48,644
You'll have to excuse the place.

699
00:50:48,646 --> 00:50:52,214
     It's a bit of disaster
since my husband's been on tour.

700
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:53,816
          Oh, really?

701
00:50:53,818 --> 00:50:58,354
       My little brother
       is in Afghanistan.

702
00:50:58,356 --> 00:51:00,423
      Oh, no, my husband's
          a musician.

703
00:51:00,425 --> 00:51:03,159
           Oh, cool.

704
00:51:03,161 --> 00:51:04,460
I'm sorry.

705
00:51:04,462 --> 00:51:06,295
           Excuse me,
      I have to take this.

706
00:51:06,297 --> 00:51:08,531
        Hey, Julie, hey.

707
00:51:08,533 --> 00:51:10,833
         No, I haven't.

708
00:51:10,835 --> 00:51:12,701
       No, hey, shut up,
       shut up, shut up.

709
00:51:12,703 --> 00:51:16,138
      You'll never believe
     where I am right now.

710
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:29,085
   This is Captain Johnathan
       and first mate Kim

711
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:31,587
  looking for any sea monsters
          in the area.

712
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:34,290
 I don't wanna be a first mate.
     I wanna be a mermaid.

713
00:51:34,292 --> 00:51:37,093
  Why a mermaid? Mermaids are
   boring. They don't fight.

714
00:51:37,095 --> 00:51:39,095
         I don't care.
     I wanna be a mermaid.

715
00:51:39,097 --> 00:51:40,796
          Then get in.

716
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:43,432
   If you wanna be a mermaid,
 you have to get in the ocean.

717
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,501
   I'm not getting in there.

718
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:48,104
           Watch out!

719
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:51,607
             - Why?
          - Sea snake!

720
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:52,675
        Man the harpoon!

721
00:51:52,677 --> 00:51:54,577
Kim!

722
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:56,378
    It's just an old spring.

723
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:59,548
   - No, it's a sea serpent.
       - Don't be stupid.

724
00:52:03,554 --> 00:52:05,754
       A pretty bluebird.

725
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,761
          - Thank you.
  - Mom, get it away from me!

726
00:52:12,763 --> 00:52:15,698
  - Here, piggy, piggy, piggy!
     - Get it away from me!

727
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:18,601
We have to go.
  Be careful. Watch your step.

728
00:52:18,603 --> 00:52:21,537
        Get in the car.

729
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:23,305
         - We gotta go.
            - Okay.

730
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:25,307
 - We'll get our own ride back.
        - Are you sure?

731
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:26,475
       Yeah, that's fine.
          We'll walk.

732
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:27,810
        Okay, thank you.

733
00:52:27,812 --> 00:52:29,345
              Bye.

734
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,195
         Hey, Grandma!

735
00:52:46,197 --> 00:52:48,364
Well, hey, there, little rascal.
        Where you been?

736
00:52:48,366 --> 00:52:50,366
       You wanna help me
         fix my garden?

737
00:52:50,368 --> 00:52:52,301
             - No.
           - Why not?

738
00:52:52,303 --> 00:52:54,770
      'Cause Mom says that
I couldn't come into your house

739
00:52:54,772 --> 00:52:56,505
         or your yard.

740
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,274
      Why'd she say that?

741
00:52:58,276 --> 00:53:00,843
  I don't know, but can I have
     a drink from the hose?

742
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:02,778
           Of course.

743
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,380
      But don't tell Mom.

744
00:53:04,382 --> 00:53:06,348
              Why?

745
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:09,351
        'Cause our water
     got turned off today.

746
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:11,520
     Well, sure, of course.

747
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:13,789
             Okay.

748
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:46,655
<i> "Hello, Jo.</i>

749
00:53:46,657 --> 00:53:48,691
        <i> Well, here I am.</i>

750
00:53:48,693 --> 00:53:51,227
    <i> Better late than never,</i>
            <i> I guess.</i>

751
00:53:51,229 --> 00:53:53,629
            <i> I hope.</i>

752
00:53:53,631 --> 00:53:55,898
     <i> I started to write you</i>
       <i> a thousand times,</i>

753
00:53:55,900 --> 00:54:00,436
         <i> but the words</i>
   <i> just never seemed to fit.</i>

754
00:54:00,438 --> 00:54:05,007
     <i> This morning I woke up</i>
   <i> in a motel room in Memphis</i>

755
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:09,011
        <i> to the sight of</i>
   <i> one regal little cockroach</i>

756
00:54:09,013 --> 00:54:10,746
     <i> perched on my pillow,</i>

757
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:12,748
      <i> just staring at me.</i>

758
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,650
     <i> And before I knew it,</i>

759
00:54:14,652 --> 00:54:17,753
    <i> all I could think about</i>
         <i> was Galveston,</i>

760
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:20,723
 <i> that night we spent together,</i>

761
00:54:20,725 --> 00:54:24,426
  <i> that morning we woke to find</i>
 <i> an entire army of cockroaches</i>

762
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:27,730
         <i> closing in on</i>
      <i> last night's dinner.</i>

763
00:54:27,732 --> 00:54:30,599
      <i> Our very first taste</i>
          <i> of freedom.</i>

764
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:34,470
         <i> Everything was</i>
        <i> so simple then,</i>

765
00:54:34,472 --> 00:54:36,972
           <i> so clear.</i>

766
00:54:36,974 --> 00:54:41,377
   <i> It was the one time I knew</i>
     <i> exactly what I wanted.</i>

767
00:54:41,379 --> 00:54:44,046
       <i> I just wanted you.</i>

768
00:54:44,048 --> 00:54:46,915
        <i> I miss you, Jo.</i>

769
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:50,719
       <i> I do. I know this</i>
     <i> has been hard on you,</i>

770
00:54:50,721 --> 00:54:54,056
     <i> but things really seem</i>
   <i> to be picking up out here.</i>

771
00:54:54,058 --> 00:54:56,625
 <i> The shows are getting better,</i>

772
00:54:56,627 --> 00:55:00,462
  <i> and I finally have a little</i>
    <i> money to send your way.</i>

773
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:03,632
   <i> I wish I was sending more.</i>

774
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:07,703
         <i> How's Wee Wee</i>
      <i> and the Wonder Boy?</i>

775
00:55:07,705 --> 00:55:11,940
     <i> I hope he understands.</i>

776
00:55:11,942 --> 00:55:16,645
    <i> I used to see the world</i>
         <i> like he does.</i>

777
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:18,614
     <i> Now there's a question</i>
        <i> for everything.</i>

778
00:55:18,616 --> 00:55:22,718
      <i> I can't seem to hold</i>
         <i> onto anything.</i>

779
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:27,456
  <i> I wish I could just go back</i>
  <i> to that motel in Galveston,</i>

780
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:31,493
      <i> where it made sense.</i>

781
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:34,963
   <i> I don't know why I can't.</i>

782
00:55:34,965 --> 00:55:38,701
       <i> Maybe I'm broken.</i>

783
00:55:38,703 --> 00:55:41,070
     <i> Maybe I could fix it.</i>

784
00:55:41,072 --> 00:55:46,909
        <i> But for now on,</i>
   <i> I'll just keep searching.</i>

785
00:55:46,911 --> 00:55:48,977
      <i> Searching for you."</i>

786
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:16,405
            No shit.

787
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:23,946
          - That's it?
       - I got this too.

788
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:28,150
            - Dang.
           - I know.

789
00:56:28,152 --> 00:56:30,819
           - Not bad.
            - I know.

790
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:36,091
    Hmm. Man, it won't scan.

791
00:56:36,093 --> 00:56:38,660
    Something wrong with it?

792
00:56:38,662 --> 00:56:41,029
         I don't know.
   It says you won 200 bucks.

793
00:56:41,031 --> 00:56:43,399
       Hey, Leon, can you
      take a look at this?

794
00:56:43,401 --> 00:56:45,834
          God darn it!
I told you to move that bucket.

795
00:56:45,836 --> 00:56:48,070
 We all gonna be millionaires?

796
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:49,638
         I don't know.
 I think the scanner's busted.

797
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,040
- You gambling, honey?

798
00:56:52,042 --> 00:56:56,578
 No, this is a Tennessee Lotto.

799
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,080
              Oh.

800
00:57:01,851 --> 00:57:03,852
          So you guys
     can't cash this here?

801
00:57:03,854 --> 00:57:08,891
         Sorry, JoLynn.
  It's only good in Tennessee.

802
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,464
      Come on, Johnathan.

803
00:57:15,466 --> 00:57:17,833
     I'd drive to Tennessee
         for 200 bucks.

804
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:34,917
           Johnathan!

805
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:41,156
 Please come take your medicine
     and brush your teeth.

806
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:43,492
      - Okay. Guess what.
            - What?

807
00:57:43,494 --> 00:57:46,495
    I was just reading that
a lobster doesn't have a brain.

808
00:57:46,497 --> 00:57:49,698
           - Really?
           - Mm-hmm.

809
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,100
        And its kidneys
      are in its forehead,

810
00:57:52,102 --> 00:57:54,736
         and its teeth
      are in its stomach.

811
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:58,740
          Please chew
    with your mouth closed.

812
00:57:58,742 --> 00:58:00,876
    So if you're ever facing
        a giant lobster,

813
00:58:00,878 --> 00:58:04,246
  I'll bash it in its forehead
          to kill it.

814
00:58:04,248 --> 00:58:07,816
   I am a lucky, lucky woman.

815
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:16,825
- Okay, go to bed, please.
-          - Oh--

816
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:34,610
  Please forgive me for being
     a bad wife and mother.

817
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:40,616
     I know I ain't good at
 giving my child what he needs.

818
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:47,089
        I promise you...

819
00:58:47,091 --> 00:58:50,158
         I promise you
        I'll be better.

820
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:56,231
I can't do this on my own.

821
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:22,157
             - Hi.
             - Hi.

822
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:24,893
      - Are you Johnathan?
      - Yeah. Who are you?

823
00:59:24,895 --> 00:59:29,331
           I'm Gale.
       Can I talk to you?

824
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:32,668
      I just wanna ask you
        a few questions.

825
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:34,670
 I'm friends with your grandma.

826
00:59:34,672 --> 00:59:36,171
             Okay.

827
00:59:36,173 --> 00:59:37,940
     So where's your mama?

828
00:59:37,942 --> 00:59:40,075
            Asleep.

829
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:41,843
    Have you had breakfast?

830
00:59:41,845 --> 00:59:45,280
    No, but she'll probably
 make oatmeal when she gets up.

831
00:59:45,282 --> 00:59:47,816
You don't like
        oatmeal, do you?

832
00:59:47,818 --> 00:59:49,051
              No.

833
00:59:49,053 --> 00:59:51,954
          I heard that
      you have a pet pig.

834
00:59:51,956 --> 00:59:53,622
         Yeah, Wee Wee.

835
00:59:53,624 --> 00:59:55,624
    And I heard that Wee Wee
    sleeps in your bedroom.

836
00:59:55,626 --> 00:59:58,894
      Sometimes, but Mama
  don't like her in the house.

837
00:59:58,896 --> 01:00:01,597
       She doesn't? Hmm.

838
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,799
 Well, can I see your bedroom?

839
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:09,738
             Okay.

840
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,680
     Who the hell are you?

841
01:00:18,682 --> 01:00:21,183
 I'm Gale with Social Services.

842
01:00:21,185 --> 01:00:24,753
      Step away from her,
           Johnathan.

843
01:00:24,755 --> 01:00:27,122
         I'd advise you
  to put down the gun, ma'am.

844
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:29,124
       What are you doing
          in my house?

845
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:30,926
     I'm just doing my job.

846
01:00:30,928 --> 01:00:32,661
     Now, there's no reason
          to be upset.

847
01:00:32,663 --> 01:00:34,663
     Do you have a warrant?

848
01:00:34,665 --> 01:00:35,964
          No, not yet.

849
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:37,966
       Then get the hell
        out of my house!

850
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:43,038
   I'd advise that you comply
    with our investigation.

851
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,374
    Well, I'd advise you to
 stay the hell off my property.

852
01:00:45,376 --> 01:00:48,276
        Okay, but if you
        don't cooperate,

853
01:00:48,278 --> 01:00:51,947
 I come back with a court order
  and an officer to escort me.

854
01:00:51,949 --> 01:00:53,949
     Let's talk about this.

855
01:00:53,951 --> 01:00:57,019
     You stay the hell away
          from my son.

856
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:05,427
 I don't want you to ever talk
   to that woman again. Ever.

857
01:02:01,284 --> 01:02:04,419
<i> Since the little</i>
      <i> boy's dad was away,</i>

858
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:07,489
       <i> the mama leviathan</i>
       <i> sent sea monsters</i>

859
01:02:07,491 --> 01:02:10,392
      <i> to attack his home.</i>

860
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:13,729
  <i> The crab monster came first.</i>

861
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:21,002
 <i> And then came the big fat one</i>
     <i> with a thousand eyes.</i>

862
01:02:21,004 --> 01:02:25,774
<i>No matter how many sea monsters</i>
<i>the mama leviathan would bring,</i>

863
01:02:25,776 --> 01:02:29,277
     <i> he will always protect</i>
          <i> his mother.</i>

864
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:35,784
             - Yes?
    - I'm looking for Mark.

865
01:02:35,786 --> 01:02:36,852
     He's out back working.

866
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:44,025
         Hey, stranger.

867
01:02:44,027 --> 01:02:45,227
              Hi.

868
01:02:45,229 --> 01:02:46,495
        Something wrong?

869
01:02:46,497 --> 01:02:48,497
   Why'd you call CPS on me?

870
01:02:48,499 --> 01:02:50,165
  What are you talking about?

871
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:53,201
   I'd expect that from her,
       but not from you.

872
01:02:53,203 --> 01:02:54,803
            Oh, boy.

873
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:58,140
 Yeah, we had a fight about it.

874
01:02:58,142 --> 01:02:59,474
          Yeah, well,
    they came to the house.

875
01:02:59,476 --> 01:03:01,209
    Well, I'm sorry, JoLynn.

876
01:03:01,211 --> 01:03:04,412
     This is not my doing.
       This is her thing.

877
01:03:04,414 --> 01:03:07,516
       I happen to think
  you're a pretty good mother.

878
01:03:07,518 --> 01:03:10,986
    She's just trying to do
   what she thinks is right.

879
01:03:10,988 --> 01:03:13,555
    Now, I'm in no position
       to judge anybody,

880
01:03:13,557 --> 01:03:16,391
          but the way
      you and David live,

881
01:03:16,393 --> 01:03:20,962
      that is not the way
         we raised him.

882
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:23,398
   Let me show you something.

883
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,001
    Can you see those medals
          right there?

884
01:03:26,003 --> 01:03:29,571
Now, those are my most cherished
     personal possessions,

885
01:03:29,573 --> 01:03:31,807
       and here they sit
      in this dirty garage

886
01:03:31,809 --> 01:03:37,078
   because they don't go well
     with her knickknacks.

887
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:39,548
   Sometimes in life you got
    to choose your battles.

888
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:42,851
        Now, her little
        ceramic trinkets

889
01:03:42,853 --> 01:03:46,321
      may mean more to her
         than those do,

890
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:52,360
     but those do not mean
   more to me than she does.

891
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,365
      I'm sorry. That's...

892
01:03:57,367 --> 01:03:59,401
 That's the most pathetic thing
        I've ever heard.

893
01:03:59,403 --> 01:04:03,271
            Come on.
     Don't make fun of me.

894
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:10,412
    No, I mean she's luckier
     than hell to have you.

895
01:04:10,414 --> 01:04:13,615
         Yeah, she is.

896
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:23,859
           Hey, uh...

897
01:04:23,861 --> 01:04:26,294
       do you ever think
 you could love somebody else?

898
01:04:26,296 --> 01:04:28,296
       Now, why would you
          ask me that?

899
01:04:28,298 --> 01:04:33,335
  I mean, do you feel like you
 love her 'cause she's the one?

900
01:04:33,337 --> 01:04:36,638
 Or did you decide long before
 she threw you out in the shed?

901
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,640
  Frankly I don't see what the
hell difference it makes anyway

902
01:04:38,642 --> 01:04:41,877
      'cause it's not like
      I'm going anywhere.

903
01:04:41,879 --> 01:04:45,413
   Sweetie, sometimes in life
 you get to choose your family

904
01:04:45,415 --> 01:04:48,416
    and sometimes you don't.

905
01:04:48,418 --> 01:04:51,519
   But that doesn't make them
        any less family.

906
01:04:51,521 --> 01:04:53,355
       I mean, like you.

907
01:04:53,357 --> 01:04:57,259
  To me, you are my daughter.

908
01:04:57,261 --> 01:05:01,096
     You always have been,
    and you always will be.

909
01:05:01,098 --> 01:05:04,900
           And that's
    just the way that is...

910
01:05:04,902 --> 01:05:06,968
       'cause I love you.

911
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:13,074
       No matter what you
       may decide to do.

912
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:18,914
         I owe you more
    than I could ever repay.

913
01:05:18,916 --> 01:05:23,018
 No, you don't owe me anything.

914
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:27,155
           For once,
  I'm offering you something.

915
01:05:27,157 --> 01:05:28,990
         I'm listening.

916
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:33,028
    A freezer full of meat.

917
01:05:44,006 --> 01:05:46,508
        Will you, uh...

918
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:50,378
     Will you meet me back
   at the generator at 9:00?

919
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:53,281
   And don't tell Johnathan.

920
01:05:58,554 --> 01:06:00,488
         I'll be there.

921
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:17,238
      The only true weapon
for a sea warrior is a trident!

922
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,207
             - Hey.
        - Like Poseidon.

923
01:06:19,209 --> 01:06:20,642
             What?

924
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:22,711
     Come sit down with me.

925
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,246
           Come here.

926
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:29,417
       - You having fun?
            - Yeah.

927
01:06:29,419 --> 01:06:31,553
             Good.

928
01:06:31,555 --> 01:06:34,055
       Hey, you wanna go
       on a trip with me?

929
01:06:34,057 --> 01:06:35,724
       Where will we go?

930
01:06:35,726 --> 01:06:37,359
       Wherever we want.

931
01:06:37,361 --> 01:06:39,995
    Can we go to the ocean?

932
01:06:39,997 --> 01:06:42,364
       Yeah, we can try.

933
01:06:42,366 --> 01:06:44,766
        When will we go?

934
01:06:44,768 --> 01:06:46,534
           Tomorrow.

935
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:50,305
         But you gotta
     promise me something.

936
01:06:50,307 --> 01:06:51,539
             What?

937
01:06:51,541 --> 01:06:54,442
    You can't tell anybody.

938
01:06:54,444 --> 01:06:56,044
            - Okay?
            - Okay.

939
01:06:56,046 --> 01:06:57,345
           - Promise?
          - I promise.

940
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:58,747
             Okay.

941
01:06:58,749 --> 01:07:00,382
 It's just gonna be me and you.

942
01:07:00,384 --> 01:07:03,218
      What about Wee Wee?

943
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:05,220
   We'll have to ask Grandpa
      to take care of her.

944
01:07:05,222 --> 01:07:06,688
             Okay.

945
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:08,690
          Okay, go on.

946
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:19,634
<i> Once there was</i>
         <i> a little boy,</i>

947
01:07:19,636 --> 01:07:23,571
<i>and him and his mom and his pig</i>
     <i> went out to the ocean,</i>

948
01:07:23,573 --> 01:07:26,808
   <i> and he's trying to protect</i>
   <i> his mom from the leviathan</i>

949
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:29,077
        <i> 'cause he killed</i>
        <i> her little baby,</i>

950
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:30,712
     <i> the leviathan's baby.</i>

951
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:34,182
      Sharky piggy, piggy,
         piggy, piggy!

952
01:07:34,184 --> 01:07:35,784
            Come on.

953
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:42,490
       <i> And the leviathan</i>
     <i> is a giant old octopus</i>

954
01:07:42,492 --> 01:07:44,826
   <i> that could stand on land.</i>

955
01:07:44,828 --> 01:07:46,694
       <i> Real sea monster.</i>

956
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:54,069
       <i> So the little boy</i>
  <i> and Wee Wee the Shark Piggy</i>

957
01:07:54,071 --> 01:07:56,504
        <i> went to go fight</i>
        <i> this leviathan.</i>

958
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:03,745
          Wee Wee, no!

959
01:08:03,747 --> 01:08:06,815
   <i> After 5 miles of swimming,</i>

960
01:08:06,817 --> 01:08:12,587
   <i> digestive systems growling</i>
      <i> for hunger and food,</i>

961
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:17,625
     <i> this long arm came up</i>
    <i> and scooped up Wee Wee.</i>

962
01:08:17,627 --> 01:08:22,864
   <i> Luckily it didn't eat her</i>
    <i> before I could save her.</i>

963
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:29,737
    <i> He said it was worth it</i>
<i>for saving his mom and his pig.</i>

964
01:08:29,739 --> 01:08:32,507
          - Johnathan!
        - What happened?

965
01:08:32,509 --> 01:08:34,209
   You knocked yourself out.

966
01:08:34,211 --> 01:08:36,211
        Why did you jump
        out of the boat?

967
01:08:36,213 --> 01:08:39,147
         I don't know.
         My eyes hurt.

968
01:08:39,149 --> 01:08:41,483
       Oh, God, not now.

969
01:08:41,485 --> 01:08:43,318
             Okay.

970
01:08:51,594 --> 01:08:53,394
            Curtis!

971
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:56,798
        Hey, what's up?
           You okay?

972
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:59,367
     Look. Can we come in?
       We need your help.

973
01:08:59,369 --> 01:09:02,203
     Oh, shit. Yeah, yeah.

974
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:11,379
   You sure you want to make
  a nine-year-old take vapors?

975
01:09:11,381 --> 01:09:13,281
           I have to.

976
01:09:13,283 --> 01:09:14,849
      If we don't relieve
         the pressure,

977
01:09:14,851 --> 01:09:17,485
 the damage is permanent, so...

978
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:21,456
I'm not gonna let him go blind.

979
01:09:21,458 --> 01:09:24,626
       All right, listen,
 I want you to open your mouth,

980
01:09:24,628 --> 01:09:27,395
     and I'm gonna blow air
     into your mouth, okay?

981
01:09:27,397 --> 01:09:29,664
             Okay.

982
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:32,167
    It might make you cough
         a little bit,

983
01:09:32,169 --> 01:09:34,169
  but I want you to hold it in
      as long as you can.

984
01:09:34,171 --> 01:09:36,171
    Can you do that for me?

985
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:52,520
              Hold it.

986
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:54,689
            Hold it.

987
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:58,960
         - It tickles.
   - I know it tastes funny,

988
01:09:58,962 --> 01:10:02,697
       but that's 'cause
      it's medicine, okay?

989
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,465
      You did a good job.

990
01:10:04,467 --> 01:10:07,235
     Now we're gonna do it
  one more time for me, okay?

991
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,952
 So that phone's gotta be worth
at least a couple hundred bucks.

992
01:11:30,954 --> 01:11:33,288
    And then the scratch-off
      is as good as cash.

993
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:37,825
          Where'd you
       get this phone at?

994
01:11:37,827 --> 01:11:41,529
         Don't matter.
   Look, I need this for him.

995
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:46,901
      Okay. I'll do it...
            for you.

996
01:11:46,903 --> 01:11:48,703
           For Johnathan.

997
01:11:48,705 --> 01:11:50,605
         For Johnathan.

998
01:12:05,954 --> 01:12:07,822
       It's a nice phone.

999
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:08,890
             Yeah.

1000
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:15,730
     Hey, Lonny! Hey, man.

1001
01:12:15,732 --> 01:12:17,765
    Hey, it's Curtis, yeah.

1002
01:12:17,767 --> 01:12:19,834
   Yeah, hey, could you maybe
        come by my place

1003
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:25,673
    and bring that real cute
kewpie doll that I like so much?

1004
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:28,476
       No, the Q.P. doll.

1005
01:12:28,478 --> 01:12:30,678
       The real nice one.

1006
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:37,752
         Buddy, I need
   a quarter pound of hydro.

1007
01:12:37,754 --> 01:12:39,120
       The best you got.

1008
01:12:39,122 --> 01:12:41,923
     All right, all right.

1009
01:12:41,925 --> 01:12:45,426
       All right, thanks.
          Bye, buddy.

1010
01:12:45,428 --> 01:12:46,861
  He's gonna call back in 10.

1011
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:48,596
   If we gotta go somewhere,
        you're driving.

1012
01:12:48,598 --> 01:12:50,498
        I can't, Curtis.
      Johnathan's inside.

1013
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,834
     - I'm not leaving him.
    - He's passed out cold.

1014
01:12:52,836 --> 01:12:54,602
        If he wakes up,
   he'll be fine by himself.

1015
01:12:54,604 --> 01:12:57,071
 No, man, if something happens,
         I'll lose him.

1016
01:12:57,073 --> 01:12:59,707
     If something happens,
    I got two DWIs already.

1017
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:02,777
 If I get caught driving again,
      hmm, uh-uh, no way.

1018
01:13:02,779 --> 01:13:05,613
  No way. I am way too pretty
          for prison.

1019
01:13:05,615 --> 01:13:08,049
  No, I'm not driving, Curtis.

1020
01:13:08,051 --> 01:13:10,752
            I can't.

1021
01:13:13,422 --> 01:13:18,960
   At least you get to drive
  a balls-to-the-wall classic.

1022
01:13:18,962 --> 01:13:21,162
 This is a 300 effin' Z, baby.

1023
01:13:21,164 --> 01:13:24,665
        170 horsepower,
     rear wheel drive, V6.

1024
01:13:24,667 --> 01:13:27,802
  Man, this car costs $30,000
     when it was brand-new.

1025
01:13:27,804 --> 01:13:29,737
      Yeah, in like 1982.

1026
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:32,940
        Hey, 1986, man.

1027
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:35,610
          Yeah, well,
      what's it worth now?

1028
01:13:35,612 --> 01:13:37,145
           Who cares?
        It's got T-tops.

1029
01:13:37,147 --> 01:13:38,913
      Man, they don't even
      make those anymore..

1030
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:41,783
      And that rear window
          is louvered.

1031
01:13:41,785 --> 01:13:43,951
   - That is some posh shit.
           - Mm-hmm.

1032
01:13:43,953 --> 01:13:46,087
       That's like having
   French blinds on your car.

1033
01:13:46,089 --> 01:13:47,688
            Mm-hmm.

1034
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:52,760
There he is.

1035
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:56,731
      I'll be right back.

1036
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:03,204
     How you doing, Lonny?

1037
01:14:03,206 --> 01:14:06,107
           Shit, man,
     I've had better days.

1038
01:14:06,109 --> 01:14:09,510
       Hey, man, push me
    on this thing, will you?

1039
01:14:09,512 --> 01:14:11,078
            - What?
            - Yeah!

1040
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:15,516
   I used to love this thing
   when I was a kid. Push me.

1041
01:14:16,518 --> 01:14:18,453
             Okay.

1042
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:21,456
       Hey, not so fast.

1043
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:25,026
      Hey, do I look like
    a screaming schoolgirl?

1044
01:14:25,028 --> 01:14:27,128
             Aaah!

1045
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:29,697
          Now hop on.

1046
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:50,651
   How long has it been since
  you've been on one of these?

1047
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:53,588
          Been awhile.
   I hate these damn things.

1048
01:14:57,759 --> 01:15:00,895
 I'm sorry, Lonny. I can't stay
 and play in the park all day.

1049
01:15:00,897 --> 01:15:03,164
        Seriously, I...

1050
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:05,566
           Seriously,
    I think I'm gonna vomit.

1051
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:11,138
         Can we just--
      Can we just do this?

1052
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:13,207
        It's all there.

1053
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:17,912
        There's a point
        in a man's life

1054
01:15:17,914 --> 01:15:21,215
    when he yearns to enjoy
       a place like this.

1055
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:26,521
    Is everything all right?

1056
01:15:26,523 --> 01:15:28,656
        See you around.

1057
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:34,529
         Sorry, Curtis.

1058
01:15:34,531 --> 01:15:36,597
      Sometimes you gotta
       throw a dog a bone

1059
01:15:36,599 --> 01:15:39,066
         or else he'll
       come after yours.

1060
01:15:46,074 --> 01:15:47,308
          Oh, my God.

1061
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:52,613
                Hey!

1062
01:15:52,615 --> 01:15:54,749
              Hey!

1063
01:17:29,878 --> 01:17:31,879
              Mom!

1064
01:17:34,249 --> 01:17:36,651
              Mom!

1065
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:44,325
                Mom!

1066
01:17:44,327 --> 01:17:45,860
              Mom!

1067
01:17:45,862 --> 01:17:48,963
Mom!

1068
01:19:12,181 --> 01:19:14,348
           Johnathan!

1069
01:19:18,387 --> 01:19:19,754
Johnathan!

1070
01:19:19,756 --> 01:19:22,189
        Can you hear me?
       Go to the window!

1071
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:25,226
        Open the window.

1072
01:19:25,228 --> 01:19:27,094
    Come on, get your stuff.
         We gotta go..

1073
01:19:27,096 --> 01:19:30,331
             - Why?
        - Do it, please.

1074
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:34,902
Where's Curtis?

1075
01:19:34,904 --> 01:19:37,772
 He had to go help some people.

1076
01:19:40,475 --> 01:19:43,043
  - What are you looking for?
       - It don't matter.

1077
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:49,150
           <i> Hot dogs!</i>
      <i> Grab your hot dogs!</i>

1078
01:19:49,152 --> 01:19:52,019
  <i> Get your mustard and relish.</i>
     <i> Get your fixings here.</i>

1079
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:00,861
         Sorry, Curtis.

1080
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:04,832
       Come on, let's go.

1081
01:20:07,904 --> 01:20:11,572
- Are you gonna answer it, Mama?
    - No, just pedal faster.

1082
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:22,817
  - Go get your clothes, okay?
             - Why?

1083
01:20:22,819 --> 01:20:24,251
          Just do it!

1084
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:35,196
<i> Is that you?</i>

1085
01:20:35,198 --> 01:20:36,297
         Yeah, it's me.

1086
01:20:36,299 --> 01:20:37,331
              <i> Oh.</i>

1087
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:40,467
           I'm sorry.

1088
01:20:40,469 --> 01:20:42,303
       - I'm-- I'm real--
             -<i> No.</i>

1089
01:20:42,305 --> 01:20:44,138
       Listen, I'm sorry.
     This is all my fault.

1090
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:45,506
      Don't say anything.

1091
01:20:45,508 --> 01:20:47,374
          I don't know
     if they're listening.

1092
01:20:47,376 --> 01:20:49,276
    But if you bastards are,
       I want you to know

1093
01:20:49,278 --> 01:20:54,281
      what you don't find
        was never there.

1094
01:20:54,283 --> 01:20:57,084
        I got to go now.

1095
01:20:57,086 --> 01:21:01,088
      <i> I don't know if they</i>
     <i> can trace this, but...</i>

1096
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:03,424
     don't worry about me.

1097
01:21:03,426 --> 01:21:07,261
  <i> They don't know who you are.</i>

1098
01:21:07,263 --> 01:21:10,164
            <i> I just--</i>

1099
01:21:10,166 --> 01:21:13,100
      I just called to say
        that you and...

1100
01:21:13,102 --> 01:21:18,439
    and your special someone
           are safe.

1101
01:21:20,576 --> 01:21:23,577
   <i> I would never do anything</i>
          <i> to hurt you.</i>

1102
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:28,582
   Thank you so much, Curtis.
     I can never repay you.

1103
01:21:28,584 --> 01:21:29,884
           <i> Thank you.</i>

1104
01:21:29,886 --> 01:21:32,219
              No.

1105
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:34,288
          I got to go.

1106
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:38,192
           Bye, girl.

1107
01:21:40,195 --> 01:21:41,896
              Bye.

1108
01:22:04,086 --> 01:22:06,987
    - Let's make some noise.
             - How?

1109
01:22:06,989 --> 01:22:10,391
        A lot of noise.
    Let's put on a concert.

1110
01:22:10,393 --> 01:22:13,327
          - Like Dad?
    - No. We'll wear makeup.

1111
01:22:13,329 --> 01:22:15,462
          Eww. Makeup?

1112
01:22:15,464 --> 01:22:19,700
  Yeah. Boys wear makeup too.
           On stage.

1113
01:22:19,702 --> 01:22:22,670
             - Why?
    - So girls can see 'em.

1114
01:22:22,672 --> 01:22:26,240
     But I don't want girls
           to see me.

1115
01:22:26,242 --> 01:22:28,976
  So their mamas can see them.

1116
01:22:34,683 --> 01:22:36,951
        Close your eyes.

1117
01:22:58,006 --> 01:23:02,009
 Shake your head and go crazy!
             Yeah!

1118
01:23:18,193 --> 01:23:20,561
     Hey, I gotta go check
       on the generator!

1119
01:23:20,563 --> 01:23:23,597
            - Okay!
   - Keep the concert going!

1120
01:23:23,599 --> 01:23:25,032
             Okay!

1121
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:30,738
        Go crazy! Whoo!

1122
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:37,244
            Come on.

1123
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:42,082
- Good girl.

1124
01:23:42,084 --> 01:23:44,118
         Yeah, come on.

1125
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:48,622
        Come on. I know.
     I know, honey. I know.

1126
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:56,463
    Mark, you can't do this.

1127
01:23:56,465 --> 01:23:58,699
    Will you put that away?

1128
01:24:04,707 --> 01:24:08,275
        Get on in there.
   That a girl, that a girl.

1129
01:24:12,814 --> 01:24:15,082
        I'm sorry, girl.

1130
01:24:24,325 --> 01:24:25,492
           I'm sorry.

1131
01:24:26,428 --> 01:24:28,462
         Do it, JoLynn.

1132
01:24:57,092 --> 01:24:59,827
          - Johnathan!
           - Grandpa!

1133
01:24:59,829 --> 01:25:01,295
         - Johnathan!
            - What?

1134
01:25:01,297 --> 01:25:04,198
   Get your ass back up here!

1135
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,667
    Come on! Stay away from
 the generator. It's dangerous.

1136
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:09,303
       Was that Grandpa?

1137
01:25:09,305 --> 01:25:12,139
No. It's none of your business.
            Come on.

1138
01:25:12,141 --> 01:25:14,475
    Don't do that to my arm.
           It hurts.

1139
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:17,678
           I'm sorry.

1140
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:21,682
  Grandpa had to take Wee Wee,
      so let's go inside.

1141
01:25:37,665 --> 01:25:40,234
      - Can you feel that?
           - Mm-hmm.

1142
01:25:40,236 --> 01:25:42,136
       Does it feel good?

1143
01:25:43,571 --> 01:25:46,907
     You gotta push harder.
     That's just like I do.

1144
01:25:46,909 --> 01:25:50,711
   Oh, yeah, that feels good.
  Oh, yeah, that's the stuff.

1145
01:25:50,713 --> 01:25:54,148
  - You got cute little feet.
          - Thank you.

1146
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:56,150
        They're stinky,
       but they're cute.

1147
01:25:59,388 --> 01:26:01,722
   They're coming to get you.

1148
01:26:01,724 --> 01:26:03,690
        Yeah, monsters.

1149
01:26:03,692 --> 01:26:05,659
             Raah!

1150
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:13,600
   This little piggy monster
went to the stinky fish market.

1151
01:26:13,602 --> 01:26:16,637
   This little piggy monster
            said no.

1152
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:18,372
       This little piggy
         had some ham.

1153
01:26:18,374 --> 01:26:22,809
  This little piggy had none.
              Aww!

1154
01:26:22,811 --> 01:26:25,846
    This little piggy went,
 "Wee wee wee wee wee wee wee!"

1155
01:26:25,848 --> 01:26:29,283
       all the way home.

1156
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:35,389
      What'd I say, Mama?

1157
01:26:35,391 --> 01:26:37,324
         What's wrong?

1158
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,198
      Mama, what's wrong?

1159
01:26:48,204 --> 01:26:50,837
  Everything's gonna be okay.

1160
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:08,488
          Everything's
      gonna be okay, Mama.

1161
01:27:17,599 --> 01:27:20,701
          Everything's
      gonna be all right.

1162
01:27:20,703 --> 01:27:22,869
            Promise.

1163
01:27:22,871 --> 01:27:25,872
         - You promise?
          - I promise.

1164
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:31,245
           You okay?

1165
01:27:31,247 --> 01:27:32,813
             Yeah.

1166
01:27:35,984 --> 01:27:37,484
        Come here, baby.

1167
01:27:38,653 --> 01:27:40,854
    Come lie down with Mama.

1168
01:28:12,688 --> 01:28:15,055
Come on.

1169
01:28:48,056 --> 01:28:49,690
           Johnathan!

1170
01:28:53,728 --> 01:28:55,562
      - Morning, Captain.
           - Morning.

1171
01:28:55,564 --> 01:28:57,731
         - You hungry?
           - Mm-hmm.

1172
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,668
     Shall we say a prayer?

1173
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:03,870
   God is great, God is good.
  Thanks for the food, Jesus.

1174
01:29:03,872 --> 01:29:05,672
            - Amen.
            - Amen.

1175
01:29:06,874 --> 01:29:08,942
     Eat all your medicine.

1176
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:14,548
         - Is it good?
           - Mm-hmm.

1177
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:28,428
          - You ready?
            - Ready.

1178
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:33,834
  - Can I ask you a question?
           - Mm-hmm.

1179
01:29:33,836 --> 01:29:36,970
       Why don't we just
     let the parakeets go?

1180
01:29:36,972 --> 01:29:39,673
   They'll die if we do that.

1181
01:29:39,675 --> 01:29:41,775
     It's better this way.

1182
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:47,681
         Wait, hold up.

1183
01:29:56,824 --> 01:29:59,993
<i> "Jo...</i>

1184
01:29:59,995 --> 01:30:03,430
      <i> I found the bottom.</i>

1185
01:30:03,432 --> 01:30:07,067
   <i> And it's in the same place</i>
       <i> it's always been.</i>

1186
01:30:07,069 --> 01:30:12,072
           <i> I'm sorry</i>
    <i> I put you through this.</i>

1187
01:30:12,074 --> 01:30:15,409
       <i> I thought this was</i>
         <i> what I wanted.</i>

1188
01:30:15,411 --> 01:30:18,612
     <i> But I want my family.</i>

1189
01:30:18,614 --> 01:30:23,683
       <i> I need my family.</i>
        <i> I'm coming home.</i>

1190
01:30:23,685 --> 01:30:26,420
  <i> And if you let me, I'll make</i>
 <i> this up to you and Johnathan.</i>

1191
01:30:26,422 --> 01:30:28,188
           <i> I promise.</i>

1192
01:30:28,190 --> 01:30:29,923
  <i> If you get this before I do,</i>

1193
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:32,626
          <i> I should be</i>
    <i> just around the corner.</i>

1194
01:30:32,628 --> 01:30:35,429
          <i> So we'll see</i>
     <i> who gets there faster,</i>

1195
01:30:35,431 --> 01:30:37,764
        <i> me or my words.</i>

1196
01:30:37,766 --> 01:30:40,567
      <i> I love you. David."</i>

1197
01:30:40,569 --> 01:30:42,602
  Hey, if I give you a dollar,
     would you put a stamp

1198
01:30:42,604 --> 01:30:44,471
         and throw that
      in the mail for me?

1199
01:30:44,473 --> 01:30:45,739
           I got it.

1200
01:30:45,741 --> 01:30:48,041
           - Thanks.
          - Thank you.

1201
01:30:48,043 --> 01:30:50,677
  - Johnathan, are you ready?
           - Mm-hmm.

1202
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:54,681
          What tickets
     do you have available

1203
01:30:54,683 --> 01:30:56,516
 that will get us to the beach?

1204
01:30:56,518 --> 01:30:59,453
    - One way or round trip?
       - One way, please.

1205
01:30:59,455 --> 01:31:01,087
             Okay.

1206
01:31:01,089 --> 01:31:06,560
         Well, Miami...
    for an adult and a child

1207
01:31:06,562 --> 01:31:11,932
       would be $367.50,

1208
01:31:11,934 --> 01:31:17,671
       and for San Diego,
      it would be $409.50.

1209
01:31:17,673 --> 01:31:20,640
         Okay. You got
       anything cheaper?

1210
01:31:20,642 --> 01:31:23,643
      Well, there's always
           Galveston.

1211
01:31:25,179 --> 01:31:27,881
           How much?

1212
01:31:27,883 --> 01:31:31,952
   Galveston would be $90.25.

1213
01:31:31,954 --> 01:31:33,253
            Perfect.

1214
01:31:33,255 --> 01:31:36,556
 You know, I'm gonna help you.

1215
01:31:36,558 --> 01:31:38,792
       I got the quarter.

1216
01:31:53,074 --> 01:31:55,141
<i> Once there was a little boy,</i>

1217
01:31:55,143 --> 01:31:58,545
<i>and he got a little piglet once</i>
  <i> he was only five years old.</i>

1218
01:31:58,547 --> 01:32:01,982
        One, two, three.

1219
01:32:01,984 --> 01:32:04,651
    <i> Once he was nine or so,</i>

1220
01:32:04,653 --> 01:32:08,054
  <i> him and his mom and his pig</i>
     <i> went out to the ocean</i>

1221
01:32:08,056 --> 01:32:10,690
    <i> 'cause he loves the sea.</i>

1222
01:32:10,692 --> 01:32:14,060
    <i> And him and Sharky Piggy</i>

1223
01:32:14,062 --> 01:32:17,531
        <i> went to go find</i>
     <i> the little boy's dad.</i>

1224
01:32:17,533 --> 01:32:19,599
   <i> He was lost in the ocean.</i>

1225
01:32:19,601 --> 01:32:24,204
   <i> But instead they ran into</i>
      <i> the mama leviathan.</i>

1226
01:32:24,206 --> 01:32:29,643
    <i> In anger, the leviathan</i>
       <i> tried to kill us,</i>

1227
01:32:29,645 --> 01:32:31,678
      <i> and he had to fight</i>
         <i> to the death.</i>

1228
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:34,548
   <i> And I kept on stabbing it</i>

1229
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:38,752
        <i> and stabbing it</i>
        <i> and stabbing it.</i>

1230
01:32:38,754 --> 01:32:41,054
        <i> Stupid octopus.</i>

1231
01:32:44,058 --> 01:32:48,828
 <i> They lived happily ever after</i>
 <i> with eating octopus every day.</i>
