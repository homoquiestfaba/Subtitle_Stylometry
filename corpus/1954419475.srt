1
00:00:02,672 --> 00:00:06,434
Once Upon a Time,
a classic fairy tale...

2
00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:07,791
You found me.

3
00:00:07,825 --> 00:00:10,004
...was turned upside down.

4
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:12,786
This is my happy ending.

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,355
I had never seen anything
like it on television.

6
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:17,423
It always leaves you wanting
to know more.

7
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:19,492
People see themselves in the show.

8
00:00:19,526 --> 00:00:21,461
Tonight we celebrate...

9
00:00:21,495 --> 00:00:22,795
- Snow!
- Charming.

10
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:24,096
...a story of love...

11
00:00:24,131 --> 00:00:26,098
I think true love is massive, you know,

12
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:27,933
and that's a big part of it.

13
00:00:27,968 --> 00:00:30,202
- ...and hope...
- It is never too late.

14
00:00:30,237 --> 00:00:31,404
No!

15
00:00:31,438 --> 00:00:32,739
- ...of heroes...
- Aah!

16
00:00:32,773 --> 00:00:34,674
I think there's something
that everyone responds to.

17
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:36,309
- ...and villains...
- It's very rare

18
00:00:36,343 --> 00:00:37,977
that you get the opportunity

19
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:39,611
to try and put a spin
on such classic characters.

20
00:00:39,646 --> 00:00:41,013
I wouldn't count it.

21
00:00:41,047 --> 00:00:42,181
...of courage...

22
00:00:42,215 --> 00:00:44,549
It's not our fight. It's mine.

23
00:00:44,584 --> 00:00:46,585
There's a lot of lessons
to learn from our show.

24
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:48,120
...and honor...

25
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:49,789
Everything that you want
from a fairy tale.

26
00:00:49,823 --> 00:00:52,224
Villains don't get happy endings.

27
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:54,459
...of fate...

28
00:00:54,494 --> 00:00:56,428
You will always find me,
and I will always find you.

29
00:00:56,462 --> 00:00:58,229
...and family.

30
00:00:58,264 --> 00:01:00,265
- You're here.
- Yes. We're coming to get you.

31
00:01:02,067 --> 00:01:04,169
The cast of "Once Upon a Time"

32
00:01:04,203 --> 00:01:07,071
joins creators Edward Kitsis
and Adam Horowitz...

33
00:01:07,106 --> 00:01:09,474
We're just trying
to tell a new story

34
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:11,943
based on all these things that we love.

35
00:01:11,977 --> 00:01:14,312
...for an enchanting journey
through the realms...

36
00:01:14,346 --> 00:01:16,447
It's about hope,
and it's always been about hope.

37
00:01:16,481 --> 00:01:17,648
It's back.

38
00:01:17,683 --> 00:01:20,151
I was blown away
by the scale of it.

39
00:01:20,186 --> 00:01:21,752
It was really special.

40
00:01:21,787 --> 00:01:23,121
Aah! Neal!

41
00:01:23,155 --> 00:01:24,122
...where magic...

42
00:01:24,156 --> 00:01:25,790
Look who you're really dealing with.

43
00:01:25,825 --> 00:01:27,725
- ...Is everywhere...
- No!

44
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,226
This show is so much fun.

45
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,661
...and happy endings...

46
00:01:30,696 --> 00:01:33,063
I'm excited to find out
what's gonna happen.

47
00:01:33,097 --> 00:01:34,598
- ...can sometimes...
- Aah!

48
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:36,400
Let's go!

49
00:01:36,435 --> 00:01:38,436
- ...turn wicked.
- I didn't see that coming.

50
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,737
Ooh!

51
00:01:39,771 --> 00:01:41,605
Who are we dealing with?

52
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:45,342
Wicked always wins.

53
00:01:45,376 --> 00:01:50,376
Once Upon a Time S03 Special - Wicked is Coming

00:01:53,428 --> 00:01:57,087
"Once Upon a Time" has taken us
from Storybrooke, Maine,

56
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:58,822
to the Enchanted Forest,

57
00:01:58,857 --> 00:02:00,657
and all the realms in between.

58
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,596
Most recently, our heroes
journeyed to Neverland

59
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,799
to save young Henry
from the clutches of Peter Pan.

60
00:02:10,868 --> 00:02:12,836
They were successful,

61
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,671
but Pan found his way to Storybrooke

62
00:02:14,705 --> 00:02:16,706
and cast the queen's curse.

63
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:20,276
We have no choice. You have to go.

64
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,345
All the fairy-tale characters

65
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,114
were sent back to the Enchanted Forest,

66
00:02:25,148 --> 00:02:28,784
leaving Henry and Emma
to begin a new life

67
00:02:28,818 --> 00:02:32,321
with no memory
of their time in Storybrooke.

68
00:02:32,356 --> 00:02:35,357
But if there has been one
constant along this journey...

69
00:02:36,893 --> 00:02:39,160
...it's that anything is possible

70
00:02:39,195 --> 00:02:41,430
if you hold on to hope.

71
00:02:41,464 --> 00:02:43,031
Swan.

72
00:02:43,065 --> 00:02:43,999
Who are you?

73
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:45,000
An old friend.

74
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:46,702
So let us go back in time

75
00:02:46,736 --> 00:02:50,972
when a young boy set everything
in motion.

76
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:52,307
Are you Emma Swan?

77
00:02:52,341 --> 00:02:53,841
Yeah. Who are you?

78
00:02:53,876 --> 00:02:56,811
My name's Henry. I'm your son.

79
00:02:56,845 --> 00:02:59,281
When I first got the pilot
script for "Once Upon a Time,"

80
00:02:59,315 --> 00:03:00,648
I was absolutely blown away.

81
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:03,551
Every page was so outrageously creative

82
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:05,486
and different
than anything I'd ever read.

83
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:06,988
They're not fairy tales.

84
00:03:07,023 --> 00:03:09,657
Every story in this book
actually happened.

85
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:11,759
Of course it did.

86
00:03:11,794 --> 00:03:13,060
It was just so innovative,

87
00:03:13,094 --> 00:03:14,995
and the writing is so incredible.

88
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,697
I couldn't believe
that they were able to find

89
00:03:16,732 --> 00:03:18,933
a way to make these characters
accessible

90
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:21,769
to every member of a family.

91
00:03:21,804 --> 00:03:23,938
The Evil Queen did it with her curse.

92
00:03:23,972 --> 00:03:27,107
An evil queen sent a bunch
of fairy-tale characters here?

93
00:03:27,142 --> 00:03:29,376
Yeah. And now they're trapped.

94
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:31,912
I never read a script like this before.

95
00:03:31,947 --> 00:03:33,314
There was so much humanity,

96
00:03:33,348 --> 00:03:35,115
and that really resonated with me.

97
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,051
Where have you been?!

98
00:03:37,085 --> 00:03:39,086
I found my real mom!

99
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,389
I just remember I was amazed

100
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:46,192
and make this all
sort of a cohesive thing.

101
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:48,962
It was definitely
something I wanted to be part of

102
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:50,096
after reading it

103
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,398
because I just wanted to know more

104
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:53,967
about all of these characters.

105
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,603
Well, wherever you're going, be careful.

106
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,604
I... if you need anything...

107
00:03:58,638 --> 00:03:59,939
You'll find me.

108
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:02,342
Always.

109
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:04,210
I love the idea,
and I love the notion,

110
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,578
the premise, the fact
that you had Storybrooke...

111
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,213
Hi. My name's Mr. Gold.

112
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,487
...And fairytale land.

113
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,416
Rumplestiltskin.

114
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:11,951
And these two characters
kind of run in hand in hand.

115
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:14,854
It's not very often you get
offered two characters in one.

116
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,455
Now we're talking.

117
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:22,094
There's so much going on at
any given moment on this show.

118
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,897
And there's a lot of room
for interpretation.

119
00:04:25,941 --> 00:04:27,141
Even though there was

120
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,102
a very high-concept way
of presenting that,

121
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:31,703
the underlying meaning

122
00:04:31,737 --> 00:04:34,172
was so significant and so universal

123
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,408
that I felt like it had a real chance

124
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,976
of being something
that people related to.

125
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,577
You're too late.

126
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,347
When we watched the
finished product of the pilot,

127
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:45,783
it kind of just went beyond
all expectation.

128
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:48,019
And it just had all of that magic in it.

129
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:49,353
Open it.

130
00:04:49,388 --> 00:04:51,155
That moment where Prince Charming

131
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:53,357
finds her in a casket in the forest

132
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:54,726
surrounded by the dwarfs

133
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,328
and gives her true love's kiss
and wakes her up,

134
00:04:57,362 --> 00:04:58,329
I mean, it felt really special.

135
00:04:58,363 --> 00:04:59,764
It felt magical.

136
00:04:59,798 --> 00:05:00,965
It started to snow for real.

137
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,600
You.

138
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,834
You could feel that we were filming

139
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:06,303
this iconic image from fairy tales.

140
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:08,239
You found me.

141
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:09,407
It's phenomenal.

142
00:05:09,441 --> 00:05:10,674
I'll never cease to be amazed

143
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,576
at the scale of it, the size of it.

144
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,412
Do you, Snow White,

145
00:05:14,446 --> 00:05:17,014
promise to take this man
to be your husband?

146
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:18,882
I do.

147
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,021
Fairy tales, you know,
were really the first stories

148
00:05:24,055 --> 00:05:27,524
you hear as a child,
and they stay with you forever.

149
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:34,306
I have a lot of fun
with the fairytale land stuff...

150
00:05:34,331 --> 00:05:37,267
very interesting, twisted plots.

151
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:39,369
Everybody's sort of grown up
with fairy tales.

152
00:05:39,403 --> 00:05:40,870
My mom took me to see "Snow White",

153
00:05:40,904 --> 00:05:43,206
and I saw the Evil Queen on screen

154
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,707
and got scared to death.

155
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:48,111
I shall destroy your happiness

156
00:05:48,145 --> 00:05:50,746
if it is the last thing I do.

157
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,084
Hey!

158
00:05:57,888 --> 00:06:00,556
"Snow White" was the first film
I remember seeing, you know?

159
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:03,893
And that was the biggest effect
on me, I suppose, as a child.

160
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:06,729
The witch particularly
just really freaked me out.

161
00:06:06,763 --> 00:06:08,564
I like to be spooked,

162
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:12,301
so Hansel and Gretel
was one of my favorites,

163
00:06:12,335 --> 00:06:13,835
Little Red Riding Hood

164
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:15,904
because I like things
that are really scary.

165
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:19,874
It's just fun.

166
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:22,478
It's fun to get...
you know, to be scared.

167
00:06:22,512 --> 00:06:26,681
I'm something of a disneyphile,
I call it.

168
00:06:26,716 --> 00:06:28,883
And "Snow White"
was my first princess love.

169
00:06:32,521 --> 00:06:35,323
Snow? What are you doing?

170
00:06:35,357 --> 00:06:38,259
I really did love Hook as a kid.

171
00:06:38,293 --> 00:06:40,194
What's the name of the place
we're headed, captain?

172
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:42,030
Neverland!

173
00:06:42,064 --> 00:06:47,001
The possibility of being able
to live forever is fantastic.

174
00:06:47,035 --> 00:06:49,003
Cinderella was very relatable to me

175
00:06:49,037 --> 00:06:50,971
because I was kind of
a misunderstood kid,

176
00:06:51,006 --> 00:06:52,406
and I think that feeling outcast

177
00:06:52,441 --> 00:06:55,543
was something that
I subconsciously related to.

178
00:06:55,577 --> 00:06:57,811
Did you get everything you desired?

179
00:06:57,846 --> 00:07:00,881
Most of these
fairy tales and the characters

180
00:07:00,915 --> 00:07:04,918
thematically all have a good
message in there somewhere.

181
00:07:04,953 --> 00:07:06,419
Like, you look
at "Beauty and the Beast."

182
00:07:06,454 --> 00:07:08,856
Did you do all this for me?

183
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,858
It's what's on the inside that counts.

184
00:07:10,892 --> 00:07:12,826
You're not who I thought you were.

185
00:07:14,295 --> 00:07:16,095
And I'm glad.

186
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,864
It's something we love to
explore on the show, which is,

187
00:07:17,898 --> 00:07:20,567
what is a happy ending,
and is there such a thing?

188
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:23,403
I love you, Henry.

189
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:30,577
And that, I think, is a question

190
00:07:30,611 --> 00:07:31,944
that all of our characters deal with.

191
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:33,412
I love you, too.

192
00:07:35,115 --> 00:07:37,116
You saved me.

193
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:38,885
That's what we loved about fairy tales.

194
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:42,055
It's why people buy lottery tickets

195
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:46,025
in the hope that overnight
your life will change.

196
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,860
You found us.

197
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,584
Everyone!

198
00:08:01,618 --> 00:08:03,706
Fairy tales come in all sizes.

199
00:08:03,746 --> 00:08:07,918
Grab an ax. It will give you
your dwarf name.

200
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,618
I've always called our show

201
00:08:09,652 --> 00:08:11,487
sort of the ultimate fan fiction.

202
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:15,691
The material is so ripe for invention.

203
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:17,793
The ax never lies, Dreamy.

204
00:08:17,827 --> 00:08:19,961
I always remember
Eddie saying... Grumpy.

205
00:08:19,996 --> 00:08:22,430
He said, "why is he Grumpy?"

206
00:08:23,565 --> 00:08:25,333
Then you've got more than one episode

207
00:08:25,368 --> 00:08:27,102
to explain why he is Grumpy.

208
00:08:27,136 --> 00:08:29,470
Bossy, had me another ax.

209
00:08:31,097 --> 00:08:33,017
We thought
that it would be so much fun

210
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:34,802
to put our own twists
on these fairy tales...

211
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,677
It's "Grumpy" now.

212
00:08:36,712 --> 00:08:38,079
...and playing the "what if" game.

213
00:08:38,114 --> 00:08:39,914
You know, what if
Snow White's best friend

214
00:08:39,948 --> 00:08:41,449
was Little Red Riding Hood?

215
00:08:41,483 --> 00:08:42,817
Everyone calls me Red.

216
00:08:42,851 --> 00:08:44,485
What if Pinocchio met the daughter

217
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,787
of Snow White and Prince Charming?

218
00:08:45,821 --> 00:08:47,388
There were just so many
different permutations

219
00:08:47,423 --> 00:08:48,790
that really excited us.

220
00:08:48,824 --> 00:08:50,024
What's that?

221
00:08:50,058 --> 00:08:51,626
That is your happy ending.

222
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,228
What if the Evil Queen
had her happy ending?

223
00:08:54,262 --> 00:08:56,663
What if the Evil Queen
got what she wanted?

224
00:08:56,697 --> 00:08:59,066
Here's an opportunity
to take these characters

225
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,168
and go deeper with them.

226
00:09:01,202 --> 00:09:03,270
- Help!
- Shh. Someone's here.

227
00:09:03,305 --> 00:09:04,638
Somebody help me!

228
00:09:04,672 --> 00:09:06,740
I love that episode.

229
00:09:06,774 --> 00:09:09,509
I love that we got to see
the Evil Queen in love.

230
00:09:09,544 --> 00:09:13,079
She's doe-eyed and excited about life.

231
00:09:13,113 --> 00:09:15,248
Help! Give me your hand!

232
00:09:16,451 --> 00:09:17,751
When she saves Snow White,

233
00:09:17,785 --> 00:09:20,386
she has a genuine smile on her face

234
00:09:20,421 --> 00:09:21,888
and she's really happy
to meet this little girl.

235
00:09:21,923 --> 00:09:23,557
It's okay, dear. You're safe.

236
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:26,493
You saved my life.

237
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,894
- Regina.
- I'm Snow White.

238
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:30,263
Oh, my gosh.

239
00:09:30,297 --> 00:09:32,332
Lana Parrilla and I watched
that episode together.

240
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:33,766
We both started crying.

241
00:09:34,868 --> 00:09:36,502
What are you doing with him?

242
00:09:36,536 --> 00:09:38,037
Snow, I can explain.

243
00:09:38,072 --> 00:09:40,673
To find out
that that was at the heart

244
00:09:40,707 --> 00:09:42,375
of our relationship...

245
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:44,844
You can never tell my mother.

246
00:09:44,878 --> 00:09:46,612
...changed how we portrayed
our characters

247
00:09:46,646 --> 00:09:48,514
for the rest of the series thus far.

248
00:09:48,548 --> 00:09:51,416
I should have let her die on that horse.

249
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:55,521
Because we all do truly love
all of these characters,

250
00:09:55,555 --> 00:09:57,623
I think it's just so satisfying

251
00:09:57,657 --> 00:09:59,758
once you start playing
that "what if" game.

252
00:09:59,793 --> 00:10:01,093
And the next step for us

253
00:10:01,127 --> 00:10:03,528
was this notion of mashing them up.

254
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:06,564
Geppetto, can you build such a thing?

255
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:08,700
Me and my boy, we can do it.

256
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:10,202
We are going to take Snow White

257
00:10:10,236 --> 00:10:11,803
and we're gonna take Captain Hook

258
00:10:11,837 --> 00:10:14,106
and we're gonna take Peter Pan
and the Wicked Witch,

259
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,708
and we're gonna throw them all together
in our backyard and play with them.

260
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:19,777
You know, I could have just
poof-ed us up here in an instant.

261
00:10:19,812 --> 00:10:23,414
Belle hanging out
with Grumpy in the dwarf tavern.

262
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:25,016
Thank you.

263
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,417
You know, so, you're sort of like,

264
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:27,652
"oh, well, that never happened."

265
00:10:27,686 --> 00:10:29,086
Ursula?

266
00:10:29,121 --> 00:10:30,287
I loved Ursula.

267
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:32,323
Hello.

268
00:10:32,357 --> 00:10:33,758
I felt so honored to play her.

269
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:36,593
You're... real.

270
00:10:36,628 --> 00:10:37,989
The way they've twisted them around

271
00:10:37,996 --> 00:10:39,630
and the way the relationships
have developed

272
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:42,233
through the different characters
is really cool.

273
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,934
You sent me a message...

274
00:10:43,968 --> 00:10:46,770
"help! Help! Can you save us?"

275
00:10:46,804 --> 00:10:49,773
The answer is...

276
00:10:49,807 --> 00:10:51,642
Yes.

277
00:10:51,676 --> 00:10:53,510
These two characters coming together,

278
00:10:53,545 --> 00:10:55,278
it's the beast,
but it's Rumplestiltskin.

279
00:10:55,312 --> 00:10:58,448
Belle, you can't go with this... beast.

280
00:10:58,482 --> 00:11:00,250
I think it's a fantastic dynamic.

281
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:03,153
It's such a fun relationship to play.

282
00:11:03,187 --> 00:11:05,589
You will dust my collection
and launder my clothing.

283
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,623
Yes.

284
00:11:06,658 --> 00:11:08,124
You will fetch me fresh straw

285
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,160
- when I'm spinning at the wheel.
- Got it.

286
00:11:10,194 --> 00:11:13,496
And you will skin the children
I hunt for their pelts.

287
00:11:14,631 --> 00:11:16,799
That one was a quip.

288
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,435
The cup is so iconic.

289
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:22,138
I'm so sorry, but, uh, it's chipped.

290
00:11:22,173 --> 00:11:23,373
Oh, it's just a cup.

291
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:26,175
"It's just a cup."

292
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:28,644
She's like, "okay."

293
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,512
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.

294
00:11:30,547 --> 00:11:31,881
I was wrong.

295
00:11:31,915 --> 00:11:34,183
Not a rat at all. More like a crocodile.

296
00:11:36,053 --> 00:11:39,021
I did like the story line
with him being the crocodile.

297
00:11:39,056 --> 00:11:41,056
I thought it was a good twist
on the story, you know?

298
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:42,023
You.

299
00:11:42,058 --> 00:11:44,193
Rumplestiltskin.

300
00:11:44,227 --> 00:11:46,027
What Robert does with Rumple
is fantastic

301
00:11:46,062 --> 00:11:49,231
because he's not based on
anybody whereas, like, Hook...

302
00:11:49,265 --> 00:11:50,745
we've all seen different incarnations.

303
00:11:50,766 --> 00:11:54,236
So, are you done trying to kill me?

304
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,471
I believe so.

305
00:11:55,505 --> 00:11:57,138
We started off
under the premise

306
00:11:57,172 --> 00:11:59,874
that there was Mr. Gold
and there was Rumplestiltskin.

307
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:02,010
But as the seasons have progressed,

308
00:12:02,044 --> 00:12:04,412
it's really about five or six
characters now.

309
00:12:04,446 --> 00:12:06,147
It's gonna be hard to kiss her

310
00:12:06,181 --> 00:12:08,349
when you don't know where she is.

311
00:12:08,383 --> 00:12:09,918
Yeah!

312
00:12:09,952 --> 00:12:11,987
So I need to be careful with the voice,

313
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:13,187
with the mannerisms, with the movements.

314
00:12:13,222 --> 00:12:15,156
What will make you happy?

315
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,857
All of these things
that make up the character,

316
00:12:16,891 --> 00:12:18,359
I'll have to kind of
keep close track of.

317
00:12:18,393 --> 00:12:20,361
What are you doing?

318
00:12:20,395 --> 00:12:21,596
Opening these. It's almost spring.

319
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,364
We should let some light in.

320
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:26,267
I love the curtains,

321
00:12:26,301 --> 00:12:28,068
'cause that's really the first moment

322
00:12:28,103 --> 00:12:31,939
that they have a physical
and emotional connection.

323
00:12:33,108 --> 00:12:35,242
Thank you.

324
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:37,911
I really enjoyed performing it
and working with Emilie.

325
00:12:37,946 --> 00:12:41,782
But what no one could plan for
was the reaction that that had.

326
00:12:41,816 --> 00:12:43,383
People are saying this episode

327
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:46,253
gives them hope that everyone
has got a chance...

328
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:47,521
What's happening?

329
00:12:47,555 --> 00:12:49,189
...to find love.

330
00:12:49,223 --> 00:12:51,758
Kiss me again. I... it's working.

331
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:54,294
I think that happy endings are earned.

332
00:12:54,328 --> 00:12:55,895
I don't think they're
necessarily just given to you

333
00:12:55,929 --> 00:12:57,697
- or just lying around.
- Here.

334
00:12:57,731 --> 00:12:59,199
Why, thank you.

335
00:13:01,835 --> 00:13:03,069
"Once Upon a Time" is mashing up

336
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,470
all these fairy tales together.

337
00:13:04,504 --> 00:13:06,105
But the reality is,
Eddie and Adam have written

338
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,474
a new fairy tale
which is about Emma and Henry.

339
00:13:08,508 --> 00:13:12,444
I'm sorry I lied to you about your dad.

340
00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:15,381
I promise I will never lie to you again.

341
00:13:15,415 --> 00:13:17,183
When you come together to tell a story

342
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:18,851
that has that at the root of it,

343
00:13:18,886 --> 00:13:20,586
I think a lot of that overflows

344
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,021
into the lives that are
bringing it to life every week.

345
00:13:23,056 --> 00:13:24,856
Just don't push me away.

346
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:28,327
I won't.

347
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:31,497
It definitely ends up
touching us, as well.

348
00:13:42,004 --> 00:13:45,114
So Rumplestiltskin is Henry's grandfather?

349
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,373
Apparently.

350
00:13:46,407 --> 00:13:49,443
This extended family has many ties.

351
00:13:49,477 --> 00:13:54,848
So his step-grandmother
is Regina, the Evil Queen.

352
00:13:54,882 --> 00:13:57,584
Actually, his step-great-grandmother.

353
00:13:57,619 --> 00:13:59,539
Good thing we don't have
Thanksgiving in our land

354
00:13:59,553 --> 00:14:01,420
'cause that dinner would suck.

355
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:07,093
Oh, my gosh. We're one
ginormous family on this show.

356
00:14:07,128 --> 00:14:09,929
Well, the family tree begins

357
00:14:09,964 --> 00:14:11,197
with Snow White

358
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:13,533
and the Evil Queen,
who is her stepmother.

359
00:14:13,567 --> 00:14:17,069
You are most certainly
the fairest of them all.

360
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:20,072
Regina is the daughter
of Cora,

361
00:14:20,106 --> 00:14:23,776
who was the student of Rumplestiltskin.

362
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,545
Let's begin.

363
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:27,647
Snow White then met a shepherd...

364
00:14:27,681 --> 00:14:29,415
...who became Prince Charming.

365
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:30,783
Will you marry me?

366
00:14:30,817 --> 00:14:33,752
We have Snow White and
Prince Charming's daughter...

367
00:14:34,854 --> 00:14:36,655
...Who they lost to a curse.

368
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,758
And that daughter became Emma Swan.

369
00:14:39,793 --> 00:14:40,993
So it's true.

370
00:14:41,027 --> 00:14:43,996
Snow White and Prince Charming
are my parents.

371
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,732
Emma met Neal, also known as Baelfire.

372
00:14:46,766 --> 00:14:48,800
- Neal?
- Emma.

373
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:51,503
I am the son
of Rumplestiltskin and Milah.

374
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:54,005
- What's his name?
- Baelfire.

375
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:56,441
Rumplestiltskin was married to Milah,

376
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:58,810
who left him for Captain Hook.

377
00:14:58,844 --> 00:14:59,944
Who's this?

378
00:14:59,978 --> 00:15:01,946
Oh, that's no one. It's just my husband.

379
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,315
Rumplestiltskin's son ends up

380
00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:05,817
with Snow White
and Prince Charming's daughter.

381
00:15:05,851 --> 00:15:08,186
Is this my son?

382
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,354
Emma and I had a son, Henry.

383
00:15:10,388 --> 00:15:12,924
- Yes.
- ...Who Emma gave up

384
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,958
because she didn't feel like
she could be a mother,

385
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,895
who ended up being adopted
by Regina, the Evil Queen.

386
00:15:19,331 --> 00:15:21,198
So that makes Regina

387
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:24,501
Henry's stepgrandmother and mother.

388
00:15:24,536 --> 00:15:26,169
I'm your mother.

389
00:15:26,204 --> 00:15:27,538
No, you're not.

390
00:15:27,572 --> 00:15:30,241
Regina is the adopted mother of Henry.

391
00:15:30,275 --> 00:15:32,008
I am the birth mother of Henry.

392
00:15:32,043 --> 00:15:32,976
Grandpa?

393
00:15:34,178 --> 00:15:36,680
Yeah, kid. I suppose so.

394
00:15:36,715 --> 00:15:38,675
And then we have Peter Pan,
who's Rumple's father.

395
00:15:38,682 --> 00:15:40,016
Hello, laddy.

396
00:15:40,051 --> 00:15:41,184
Peter Pan.

397
00:15:41,219 --> 00:15:42,919
Peter Pan was Rumple's father

398
00:15:42,954 --> 00:15:46,556
who used magic to reverse his aging.

399
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,391
Where's Henry?

400
00:15:48,425 --> 00:15:50,160
Oh, you mean my great-grandson.

401
00:15:50,194 --> 00:15:52,863
So Peter Pan is Henry's
great-grandfather?

402
00:15:52,897 --> 00:15:54,196
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

403
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:56,966
Family show.

404
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,604
But every happy family...

405
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:04,173
Now, my boy, for your present.

406
00:16:04,207 --> 00:16:07,910
...has a few dark secrets.

407
00:16:09,246 --> 00:16:10,712
Why would you do that?!

408
00:16:10,747 --> 00:16:12,882
The seer said the boy
would be my undoing,

409
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,250
so I have no choice.

410
00:16:14,284 --> 00:16:16,118
I must be his.

411
00:16:18,354 --> 00:16:21,757
The darker-element fairy tales
were fascinating to me.

412
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:25,294
They were scary yet sort of comforting.

413
00:16:25,328 --> 00:16:26,428
You.

414
00:16:26,462 --> 00:16:28,930
I do love it when we go dark.

415
00:16:28,964 --> 00:16:30,999
I prefer playing...
we call her Snow Gray.

416
00:16:32,168 --> 00:16:33,968
- Kill me.
- What?

417
00:16:34,003 --> 00:16:36,137
It's a chance for me to explore

418
00:16:36,172 --> 00:16:39,240
something incredibly new and scary.

419
00:16:40,576 --> 00:16:42,076
Aah!

420
00:16:42,111 --> 00:16:44,112
I love that scene on so many levels.

421
00:16:44,146 --> 00:16:46,380
It was beautifully written,

422
00:16:46,415 --> 00:16:48,817
and Ginny and I had a really
good time working on that scene.

423
00:16:48,851 --> 00:16:50,251
Do you see that?

424
00:16:50,286 --> 00:16:52,020
What did you do to it?

425
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:53,154
Oh, I didn't do that.

426
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:55,456
Being able to play that out was fun.

427
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,058
You did it.

428
00:16:57,092 --> 00:17:00,428
And once you blacken your heart,
it only grows darker.

429
00:17:00,462 --> 00:17:03,631
I like the dark side of the show, too.

430
00:17:03,665 --> 00:17:05,466
Aah!

431
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,368
I'm very lucky with Hook.

432
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,903
I get to play both sides of the coin.

433
00:17:09,938 --> 00:17:12,039
You know, he's good sometimes.
Then he's really bad.

434
00:17:13,775 --> 00:17:15,476
Eee.

435
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,445
Killing me's gonna take
a lot more than that, deary.

436
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:20,814
That Rumplestiltskin, I think,
is the interesting one

437
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:22,883
because that's the one who's not
quite complete, you know?

438
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,384
He's nasty.

439
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,619
He can kill things at the drop of a hat.

440
00:17:27,856 --> 00:17:30,123
And he's a dangerous character
at that point.

441
00:17:30,158 --> 00:17:33,960
When you see him with the seer,
the hands...

442
00:17:33,994 --> 00:17:38,030
You will find him.

443
00:17:38,065 --> 00:17:39,499
How?

444
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:42,001
He hasn't really been the Dark
One for so long at that point,

445
00:17:42,035 --> 00:17:44,937
and he's kind of... he's very mean.

446
00:17:44,972 --> 00:17:48,441
The boy will be your undoing.

447
00:17:48,476 --> 00:17:50,142
Then I'll just have to kill him.

448
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:51,677
I've always been attracted

449
00:17:51,711 --> 00:17:54,113
to the dark side of these fairy tales.

450
00:17:54,147 --> 00:17:55,681
I like exploring that world.

451
00:17:58,818 --> 00:18:00,319
In true "Once Upon a Time" style,

452
00:18:00,354 --> 00:18:01,820
these characters just keep getting

453
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,722
deeper and deeper and more complex.

454
00:18:03,757 --> 00:18:06,091
I want you all to know what I feel,

455
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:11,997
and that is regret that I was
not able to cause more pain.

456
00:18:13,232 --> 00:18:16,234
I love that episode,
and I love that switch,

457
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:18,670
and she has that kind of smile
at the end

458
00:18:18,705 --> 00:18:22,274
where, you know, I think
she also likes to put on a show.

459
00:18:22,308 --> 00:18:24,976
And above all else,
with every ounce of my being,

460
00:18:25,011 --> 00:18:29,981
I regret that I was not able to kill...

461
00:18:30,016 --> 00:18:31,950
Snow White!

462
00:18:31,984 --> 00:18:33,218
There have been so many times

463
00:18:33,252 --> 00:18:35,153
when they could have killed each other,

464
00:18:35,187 --> 00:18:36,788
and they never actually do it.

465
00:18:36,822 --> 00:18:40,324
Do it! Crush it! Get it over with.

466
00:18:40,358 --> 00:18:43,961
And put you out of your misery?

467
00:18:45,864 --> 00:18:48,699
Now get off my porch.

468
00:18:50,235 --> 00:18:53,304
Ripping hearts out is fun to do.

469
00:18:53,338 --> 00:18:54,705
It's odd and weird,

470
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,673
and the heart is so strange-looking.

471
00:19:00,278 --> 00:19:03,180
You know, it's like this
rubbery, plastic, weird thing,

472
00:19:03,214 --> 00:19:05,715
and you're pulling it
out from someone's armpit.

473
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,084
This...

474
00:19:07,118 --> 00:19:08,385
...is how it's done.

475
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,820
It's just odd.

476
00:19:11,956 --> 00:19:14,858
I wanted a heart,
and a heart I shall have.

477
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:17,093
I think she enjoys doing it.

478
00:19:17,127 --> 00:19:20,430
Again, it shows her power,
and that was very seductive.

479
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:26,002
We know that if your heart
is taken from you,

480
00:19:26,036 --> 00:19:27,370
you can be controlled...

481
00:19:27,404 --> 00:19:28,504
Bring the boy to me.

482
00:19:28,538 --> 00:19:30,173
...or you can be killed.

483
00:19:33,743 --> 00:19:36,779
We know that if your shadow
has been taken from you...

484
00:19:36,813 --> 00:19:38,781
It can pretty much result
in instant death.

485
00:19:38,815 --> 00:19:42,852
He rips your shadow
right from your body.

486
00:19:42,886 --> 00:19:45,554
R-r-r-r-ip.

487
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:47,055
I gather it hurts.

488
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,324
And we met the
original shadow of Neverland

489
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:51,460
who sounded a lot like Marilyn Manson.

490
00:19:51,495 --> 00:19:53,428
You have to believe.

491
00:19:53,463 --> 00:19:54,864
I'll take the heart rip.

492
00:19:54,898 --> 00:19:56,264
You know, because with the heart rip,

493
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:58,033
there's always the hope
it can be returned.

494
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,038
Probably heart.
That's what I'll take.

495
00:20:03,072 --> 00:20:05,707
The shadow... I don't know.
You've lost a sense of yourself.

496
00:20:05,741 --> 00:20:07,842
Just take the heart, crush it.

497
00:20:07,877 --> 00:20:10,612
It really looked like
when Greg Mendell's shadow

498
00:20:10,646 --> 00:20:12,814
was ripped from him, it was painful.

499
00:20:14,683 --> 00:20:16,318
I would say having your heart ripped out

500
00:20:16,352 --> 00:20:18,119
has some degree of pain.

501
00:20:18,153 --> 00:20:19,420
It looks like they're in shock, though,

502
00:20:19,454 --> 00:20:20,889
because the minute
they see their own heart,

503
00:20:20,923 --> 00:20:22,490
it's more like, "what just happened?"

504
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:25,627
It's like taking off a band-aid.
It happens really fast...

505
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,940
- ...and then you're okay.
- They both suck, is the truth.

506
00:20:29,965 --> 00:20:31,766
Emma!

507
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,467
You foolish girl.

508
00:20:33,502 --> 00:20:34,902
Love is weakness.

509
00:20:34,936 --> 00:20:37,371
I think
it's important for the show

510
00:20:37,406 --> 00:20:39,073
to sort of have those dark moments

511
00:20:39,107 --> 00:20:43,310
so that you can have the light
at the other side.

512
00:20:43,345 --> 00:20:45,413
I think that's why people
like it, is because...

513
00:20:45,447 --> 00:20:48,482
- No...
- ...We feel the sense of hope and love.

514
00:20:48,517 --> 00:20:50,017
It's strength.

515
00:20:52,654 --> 00:20:54,454
Even though these characters

516
00:20:54,488 --> 00:20:58,291
live in a fairy-tale world
and they're fantastical,

517
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:00,928
they're all very human,
and they go through

518
00:21:00,962 --> 00:21:02,963
universal things
that everybody goes through.

519
00:21:02,997 --> 00:21:06,499
I went to Regina's house
and she ripped out my heart.

520
00:21:06,534 --> 00:21:08,868
It had started to blacken
because of what I did.

521
00:21:08,902 --> 00:21:10,136
No.

522
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:12,051
But I think
that's the way it should be.

523
00:21:12,073 --> 00:21:16,008
Every journey that's worth
taking is never easy, right?

524
00:21:16,043 --> 00:21:18,044
We'll find another way. I know it.

525
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:20,746
What makes you so sure?

526
00:21:21,682 --> 00:21:22,782
This does.

527
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:27,419
And I know it better than anyone.

528
00:21:43,866 --> 00:21:45,193
What if it fails?

529
00:21:45,228 --> 00:21:47,568
There is power in believing.

530
00:21:47,592 --> 00:21:49,560
The magic wardrobe? It's a long shot.

531
00:21:49,594 --> 00:21:52,563
We all know this,
so how can you be so sure?

532
00:21:52,597 --> 00:21:56,567
Because I have the one thing
you need now more than anything.

533
00:21:56,601 --> 00:21:57,935
Hope.

534
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:02,840
We wanted to do something that
really embraced this idea

535
00:22:02,874 --> 00:22:04,607
that, you know, in this world,

536
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:07,944
no matter how bad things get
or how bad things seem,

537
00:22:07,979 --> 00:22:09,379
you can have hope.

538
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:11,547
Love is hope.

539
00:22:11,582 --> 00:22:14,784
And if you're in it,
you need to enjoy it.

540
00:22:14,818 --> 00:22:17,454
And that is a powerful thing
that can guide you through life.

541
00:22:17,488 --> 00:22:20,590
And how hard it is
to have it and believe in it

542
00:22:20,624 --> 00:22:22,892
and believe that your life
can get better.

543
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:25,327
If you have hope and you have
belief and you keep going,

544
00:22:25,362 --> 00:22:26,629
you'll find the answer.

545
00:22:26,663 --> 00:22:29,499
Where's the good in telling them
when there is no hope?

546
00:22:29,533 --> 00:22:31,734
Oh, if there's one thing
I've gleaned from you hero-types

547
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,435
it's that there's always hope.

548
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,338
I remember I was brought to tears

549
00:22:36,373 --> 00:22:38,573
by a speech that Mary Margaret gave...

550
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:40,609
I gave the book to him
because I wanted Henry

551
00:22:40,643 --> 00:22:43,445
to have the most important thing
anyone can have.

552
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,182
...when she talked about hope
and how important it is to hope.

553
00:22:47,217 --> 00:22:50,419
Believing in even the
possibility of a happy ending

554
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,021
is a very powerful thing.

555
00:22:52,055 --> 00:22:54,789
I believe that the heart of "Once
Upon a Time" is truly hope.

556
00:22:54,824 --> 00:22:57,826
We all hope for the best in life.

557
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,994
Snow!

558
00:22:59,028 --> 00:23:00,228
Charming.

559
00:23:00,262 --> 00:23:02,130
We all hope that we're gonna be happy.

560
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,367
You found me.

561
00:23:06,402 --> 00:23:08,870
Belief gives you hope,
and it gives you courage,

562
00:23:08,905 --> 00:23:10,804
and it gives you conviction.

563
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:12,507
- Hyah!
- It gives you strength.

564
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:13,574
No! Wait!

565
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,815
You're... a girl.

566
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:23,951
Woman.

567
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,886
The first
Snow/Charming back story

568
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:27,655
fulfilled all of my little-girl dreams

569
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:30,925
about what being in a fairy tale
would be.

570
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:32,492
You can't hide from me!

571
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:35,128
Wherever you are, I will find you!

572
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,363
I think that mostly

573
00:23:36,397 --> 00:23:37,731
when Snow White and Prince Charming met,

574
00:23:37,766 --> 00:23:40,200
they were impressed with each other.

575
00:23:42,537 --> 00:23:46,206
I told you I'd find you.

576
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,008
Aren't you a real Prince Charming.

577
00:23:49,043 --> 00:23:51,578
- I have a name, you know.
- Don't care.

578
00:23:51,612 --> 00:23:52,812
Charming suits you.

579
00:23:52,846 --> 00:23:56,749
Now cut me down, Charming.

580
00:23:56,784 --> 00:23:59,786
Snow and Charming
are absolute equals, for sure.

581
00:24:00,754 --> 00:24:02,021
Aah!

582
00:24:02,056 --> 00:24:04,523
I felt like these were
really incredible characters

583
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:06,759
and a lot of really strong
women characters.

584
00:24:06,794 --> 00:24:09,361
We don't have
any damsels in distress here

585
00:24:09,396 --> 00:24:11,931
who are waiting for a man
to come and save them.

586
00:24:11,966 --> 00:24:13,900
It's the Queen! Run!

587
00:24:13,934 --> 00:24:16,035
She's not a queen anymore.

588
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:18,504
In the wedding scene, Snow White
draws Prince Charming's sword.

589
00:24:18,538 --> 00:24:20,806
She's nothing more than an evil witch.

590
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,541
No, no, no. Don't stoop to her level.

591
00:24:22,576 --> 00:24:25,244
You know, there has not been
a lot of ball-gown wearing.

592
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:27,446
These women can all
take care of themselves.

593
00:24:28,815 --> 00:24:30,116
And so I like wearing the britches.

594
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,750
And to be honest,
they're easier to move in.

595
00:24:36,222 --> 00:24:39,424
Well, the wardrobe kind
of puts you there immediately.

596
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:42,127
We are very lucky to have
such an amazing department...

597
00:24:42,161 --> 00:24:43,228
and hair and makeup.

598
00:24:43,262 --> 00:24:44,462
Everyone just looks beautiful.

599
00:24:44,497 --> 00:24:46,431
Is that any way to address a queen?

600
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:48,634
I think I'd like to be the Evil Queen.

601
00:24:48,668 --> 00:24:50,568
She's got these crazy outfits.

602
00:24:50,603 --> 00:24:54,172
And I think it'd be fun
to wear those outfits.

603
00:24:54,206 --> 00:24:55,640
No, this won't do.

604
00:24:55,674 --> 00:24:58,809
What are you doing?

605
00:24:58,844 --> 00:25:02,580
When we meet young
Regina, she's very innocent.

606
00:25:02,615 --> 00:25:05,016
Her hair's pulled back. She has braids.

607
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,953
And then after the loss of
Daniel, she starts to transform.

608
00:25:08,987 --> 00:25:12,356
And it happens over a course of years.

609
00:25:14,225 --> 00:25:16,260
The Queen is dead.

610
00:25:16,294 --> 00:25:19,530
Long live the Evil Queen.

611
00:25:19,564 --> 00:25:23,066
That's been fun just to kind of
look at the stories

612
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,435
and go, "okay.
Well, where are we in her life?"

613
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:28,172
And that sort of manifests
in how she dresses.

614
00:25:28,206 --> 00:25:31,542
Our makeup artists will, you
know, give her a lighter cheek

615
00:25:31,576 --> 00:25:35,279
or, you know, sometimes we do
a lot of shadowing on the side

616
00:25:35,313 --> 00:25:38,215
when she's the full-on,
you know, Evil Queen.

617
00:25:38,249 --> 00:25:40,917
Leading up to enacting the curse,

618
00:25:40,951 --> 00:25:43,853
her eyes are a bit bigger and crazed,

619
00:25:43,888 --> 00:25:45,354
and the face is different.

620
00:25:45,389 --> 00:25:47,057
I want it to look different.

621
00:25:48,993 --> 00:25:51,661
When you read
a "Once Upon a Time" script,

622
00:25:51,696 --> 00:25:53,462
you can see the scale of it.

623
00:25:53,497 --> 00:25:57,900
You can feel the epic-ness,
if that's a word.

624
00:25:57,934 --> 00:25:59,335
Not just the storytelling,

625
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:01,036
but the environment
that we get to work in

626
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:02,638
and the crew that we get to work with.

627
00:26:02,673 --> 00:26:04,240
I love a challenge.

628
00:26:04,274 --> 00:26:06,041
One minute,
you're climbing a beanstalk.

629
00:26:06,076 --> 00:26:09,078
The next minute,
you're talking about pixie dust

630
00:26:09,112 --> 00:26:12,748
and, you know, trying to kill Peter Pan.

631
00:26:12,782 --> 00:26:14,616
It's just an amazing experience

632
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:17,052
to go into all these different worlds.

633
00:26:17,087 --> 00:26:19,755
There was something about
the trolls on the troll bridge

634
00:26:19,789 --> 00:26:21,090
that we fought.

635
00:26:21,124 --> 00:26:23,425
You know, the character design
of those trolls

636
00:26:23,459 --> 00:26:27,096
that reminded me of the world
of "Labyrinth" and Jim Henson.

637
00:26:28,931 --> 00:26:31,833
I was so taken with those trolls.

638
00:26:31,867 --> 00:26:33,067
You saved me.

639
00:26:33,102 --> 00:26:35,270
How could I let Prince Charming die?

640
00:26:35,304 --> 00:26:37,606
I have a name.

641
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,341
It's James.

642
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:41,843
It's nice to meet you, James.

643
00:26:41,877 --> 00:26:43,945
One of the great things
about fairy tales

644
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:45,546
is there's universal truths in them.

645
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,716
And so, for us, it's always
trying to find them

646
00:26:48,751 --> 00:26:51,085
and apply them to our characters.

647
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,554
There's more to life than just
looking for the next fight.

648
00:26:53,588 --> 00:26:55,422
You know, you got to look
for the moments.

649
00:26:55,457 --> 00:26:57,125
- Moments?
- Yes.

650
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:59,026
Life is made up of moments...
good ones, bad ones,

651
00:26:59,061 --> 00:27:00,427
but they're all worth living.

652
00:27:00,462 --> 00:27:03,364
That's an idea that's really
woven into the storytelling

653
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:04,398
every week.

654
00:27:04,432 --> 00:27:05,599
"Hey, take a breath."

655
00:27:05,634 --> 00:27:07,801
"Take a breath and look
at what's around you."

656
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:10,871
We have this idea
of how things should unfold.

657
00:27:10,905 --> 00:27:13,039
But sometimes we're missing the signs

658
00:27:13,074 --> 00:27:14,742
that are right before our eyes.

659
00:27:14,776 --> 00:27:16,777
We have to start our family now.

660
00:27:16,811 --> 00:27:18,245
I don't follow.

661
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:19,880
Regina will always be a problem.

662
00:27:19,914 --> 00:27:22,749
If not her, there will be
someone or something else.

663
00:27:22,784 --> 00:27:24,785
There will always be something else.

664
00:27:24,819 --> 00:27:28,288
You never know what's
gonna happen five minutes from now,

665
00:27:28,322 --> 00:27:30,924
so living in the moment
is a very important message

666
00:27:30,958 --> 00:27:33,059
that I think comes across really nicely.

667
00:27:33,094 --> 00:27:34,894
We have to find the good moments

668
00:27:34,928 --> 00:27:37,630
in between all of the bad ones.

669
00:27:37,665 --> 00:27:39,666
What better way to make a good moment

670
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,200
than with a child?

671
00:27:54,805 --> 00:27:57,628
Who are you?

672
00:27:57,675 --> 00:28:01,145
These characters have journeyed
to many realms...

673
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,946
Well, I really liked Wonderland

674
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,948
even though I was only there
for one episode.

675
00:28:04,982 --> 00:28:06,483
I just found it fascinating.

676
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,917
What's the name of this place?

677
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:10,286
The Enchanted Forest
is obviously the realm

678
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,855
that we've explored the most.

679
00:28:11,889 --> 00:28:13,322
It's good to be back.

680
00:28:13,357 --> 00:28:16,225
Storybrooke is where Snow White
is probably happiest,

681
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,628
but I really like
the pomp and circumstance

682
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:19,929
of the Enchanted Forest.

683
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:21,965
This is truly a night for celebration.

684
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:26,402
...but of all the worlds
they've explored...

685
00:28:26,436 --> 00:28:29,805
Only one runs on imagination.

686
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:31,207
Is that it?

687
00:28:31,241 --> 00:28:33,776
Aye. Neverland.

688
00:28:36,146 --> 00:28:39,148
I remember getting
a book of fairy tales,

689
00:28:39,183 --> 00:28:41,784
and I saw Peter Pan,
and I just fell in love with it.

690
00:28:41,818 --> 00:28:44,219
The idea that you can go to a place

691
00:28:44,253 --> 00:28:47,156
that is built
by your imagination and fly...

692
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,624
I just loved the whole idea.

693
00:28:49,659 --> 00:28:52,895
Neverland is a place
where imagination runs wild.

694
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:55,998
Their mission... to save Henry.

695
00:28:56,032 --> 00:28:59,501
But this land would present
enormous challenges.

696
00:28:59,535 --> 00:29:01,703
Well, for us, Neverland was a place

697
00:29:01,737 --> 00:29:05,173
that makes you confront your
past because there is no future.

698
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:06,675
Since you don't grow up,

699
00:29:06,709 --> 00:29:09,611
all you have is the present
and your past.

700
00:29:09,645 --> 00:29:11,112
Hide it where no one can find it.

701
00:29:11,146 --> 00:29:13,047
For Rumplestiltskin,

702
00:29:13,082 --> 00:29:17,018
coming to Neverland
is a homecoming of sorts.

703
00:29:17,052 --> 00:29:19,220
He is going to be facing his father,

704
00:29:19,254 --> 00:29:21,322
who became Peter Pan.

705
00:29:21,356 --> 00:29:24,425
The twist on Peter Pan
is that he's very, very different

706
00:29:24,459 --> 00:29:27,061
than the Peter Pan that we would
all know and love, I guess.

707
00:29:27,096 --> 00:29:28,529
He's quite a nasty character.

708
00:29:28,563 --> 00:29:30,197
Why did you bring me here?

709
00:29:30,232 --> 00:29:33,800
For quite some time, I've sought
something extremely important...

710
00:29:33,835 --> 00:29:36,337
the heart of the truest believer.

711
00:29:36,371 --> 00:29:39,540
Peter Pan is desperate
to hold on to eternal youth.

712
00:29:39,574 --> 00:29:42,343
You are the lucky owner
of that very special heart.

713
00:29:42,377 --> 00:29:45,145
You and it are mine.

714
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:48,215
Somebody who wants to be 14
for the rest of their lives,

715
00:29:48,249 --> 00:29:49,382
you know,

716
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:51,852
there's probably something
a little off about them.

717
00:29:51,886 --> 00:29:53,854
Come on, boys!

718
00:29:57,058 --> 00:29:58,324
Let's play.

719
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:00,160
I really enjoyed Neverland.

720
00:30:00,194 --> 00:30:02,495
I enjoyed that we were all
on that journey together,

721
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:04,397
that we all had
a really focused mission,

722
00:30:04,431 --> 00:30:06,098
that we all needed to save Henry.

723
00:30:06,133 --> 00:30:08,234
What did we call ourselves
at the beginning of this year?

724
00:30:08,269 --> 00:30:09,435
The Nevengers.

725
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,403
Henry!

726
00:30:11,472 --> 00:30:13,172
Hi, Emma.

727
00:30:13,206 --> 00:30:15,408
For us, it's about belief.

728
00:30:15,442 --> 00:30:18,010
It's Emma believing
in herself as a leader.

729
00:30:18,044 --> 00:30:20,124
You know, Henry had the heart
of the truest believer,

730
00:30:20,147 --> 00:30:22,281
and we had to go find him.

731
00:30:22,315 --> 00:30:23,515
Aah!

732
00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:25,417
Oh!

733
00:30:25,451 --> 00:30:26,551
Unh!

734
00:30:28,321 --> 00:30:29,721
David.

735
00:30:29,756 --> 00:30:31,023
I'm good.

736
00:30:34,828 --> 00:30:37,061
Where's Henry? Where is he?

737
00:30:38,464 --> 00:30:41,400
Emma identified more
with the orphans on the island

738
00:30:41,434 --> 00:30:42,967
even though her parents were there.

739
00:30:43,002 --> 00:30:46,070
That boy with the knife,
you stopped fighting him.

740
00:30:46,105 --> 00:30:47,238
Why?

741
00:30:47,273 --> 00:30:49,908
Because when I looked
at his face, I saw me...

742
00:30:49,942 --> 00:30:51,876
just a lost little girl

743
00:30:51,911 --> 00:30:54,545
who cried herself to sleep at night

744
00:30:54,579 --> 00:30:57,315
'cause she wanted her parents so bad.

745
00:30:57,349 --> 00:31:01,719
For Snow White, she's also
realizing she missed 28 years.

746
00:31:01,753 --> 00:31:03,387
We were cheated out of everything...

747
00:31:03,422 --> 00:31:07,225
her first step, her first word,
her first smile.

748
00:31:07,259 --> 00:31:10,060
When we get off this island
and get back to Storybrooke,

749
00:31:10,094 --> 00:31:11,895
I want to have another baby.

750
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:15,299
And whether or not they do,
we'll have to wait and see.

751
00:31:15,334 --> 00:31:17,768
You sure you don't want me
to take a look at that?

752
00:31:17,803 --> 00:31:21,271
I was lucky. My jacket wasn't.
Don't worry about it.

753
00:31:21,306 --> 00:31:23,841
Snow White and Prince Charming
find themselves in Neverland

754
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:25,475
challenged in a new way.

755
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:28,478
You know, Charming,
in the process of being heroic,

756
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,981
he's poisoned.

757
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:34,684
He spent most of Neverland
thinking he was going to die.

758
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:37,187
In this canteen is the water
that will stop the dreamshade

759
00:31:37,222 --> 00:31:38,755
that will save your life.

760
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,694
If it wasn't for Hook,
I wouldn't be alive.

761
00:31:44,729 --> 00:31:46,696
I thought he deserved a little credit.

762
00:31:46,731 --> 00:31:47,764
Thank you.

763
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,100
This is a different Captain Hook

764
00:31:51,134 --> 00:31:52,502
that's returning to Neverland.

765
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:54,270
Did you really save his life?

766
00:31:54,304 --> 00:31:55,338
That surprise you?

767
00:31:55,373 --> 00:31:57,474
He has given up on vengeance.

768
00:31:57,508 --> 00:32:00,009
He realizes it is a hollow pursuit

769
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:03,112
and that his real pursuit is Emma.

770
00:32:03,146 --> 00:32:06,916
Well, perhaps gratitude is in order now.

771
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:09,651
I think Hook has been
a big surprise for her.

772
00:32:09,686 --> 00:32:11,787
I think she did not have
high expectations for him

773
00:32:11,821 --> 00:32:14,290
based on knowing the little bit
that she knew about his past

774
00:32:14,324 --> 00:32:15,357
and him being a pirate.

775
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:16,625
You couldn't handle it.

776
00:32:16,659 --> 00:32:19,961
Perhaps you are the one
who couldn't handle it.

777
00:32:19,996 --> 00:32:22,664
Emma's a tough nut to crack
on a romantic level.

778
00:32:22,699 --> 00:32:24,633
She is, but I think Hook likes that.

779
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:26,134
He sort of likes a challenge.

780
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:34,409
That was...

781
00:32:34,443 --> 00:32:36,811
A one-time thing.

782
00:32:36,845 --> 00:32:39,381
Don't follow me. Wait five minutes.

783
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,649
Go get some firewood or something.

784
00:32:41,683 --> 00:32:43,919
As the search for Henry continued,

785
00:32:43,953 --> 00:32:46,388
a familiar face returned to Neverland.

786
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,689
Going back to Neverland for Neal

787
00:32:48,724 --> 00:32:50,958
was kind of like going back
to the old neighborhood.

788
00:32:50,992 --> 00:32:54,094
Welcome home, Baelfire.

789
00:32:54,129 --> 00:32:58,032
It's a place that Neal had spent
some time, knew how to operate.

790
00:32:58,066 --> 00:33:01,402
Pan's shadow?
That's your way off the island?

791
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,070
Unfortunately, it's the only way.

792
00:33:03,104 --> 00:33:04,338
That's why we have to capture it.

793
00:33:04,372 --> 00:33:05,439
Capture it?

794
00:33:05,473 --> 00:33:07,141
We've never been within 10 feet of Pan

795
00:33:07,175 --> 00:33:09,410
- unless he wanted us to be.
- I know where to look.

796
00:33:09,444 --> 00:33:13,613
Emma, Neal, and Hook search the
darkest corners of the island.

797
00:33:13,648 --> 00:33:14,714
Is that Pan's shadow?

798
00:33:17,152 --> 00:33:18,385
Let us go!

799
00:33:27,462 --> 00:33:29,295
Their encounter shed light on feelings

800
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:30,797
that could not be ignored.

801
00:33:30,832 --> 00:33:32,566
We almost lost our shot
at capturing the shadow

802
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,634
because you two were
fighting over a lighter!

803
00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:37,136
It wasn't the lighter
we were fighting over, love.

804
00:33:37,171 --> 00:33:40,539
It's interesting to be
even thinking about the idea

805
00:33:40,574 --> 00:33:45,711
of a love triangle because
so often what Emma's focused on

806
00:33:45,745 --> 00:33:46,879
is saving Henry.

807
00:33:46,913 --> 00:33:48,647
Let me be very clear about something.

808
00:33:48,682 --> 00:33:50,483
If I had to choose someone,

809
00:33:50,517 --> 00:33:52,718
I choose Henry.

810
00:33:52,752 --> 00:33:55,253
He's the only love
I have room for in my life.

811
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:00,425
Emma's so much more than any
single relationship in her life.

812
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:04,964
By the end of her time
in Neverland, she was a leader.

813
00:34:04,998 --> 00:34:06,565
This land is run on belief.

814
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,234
It's time for all of us to believe...

815
00:34:09,268 --> 00:34:11,603
not in magic, but in each other.

816
00:34:11,637 --> 00:34:13,472
A hero, a villain, a pirate...

817
00:34:13,506 --> 00:34:15,073
it doesn't matter which
because we're gonna need

818
00:34:15,108 --> 00:34:17,609
all those skills whether
we can stomach them or not.

819
00:34:17,643 --> 00:34:20,612
And what's your skill, Savior?

820
00:34:20,646 --> 00:34:22,114
I'm a mother.

821
00:34:22,148 --> 00:34:24,316
There's something
about all of our characters

822
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:27,151
coming together...
the villains and the heroes.

823
00:34:27,185 --> 00:34:28,586
It's been so much fun.

824
00:34:28,621 --> 00:34:30,121
Henry. Are you okay?

825
00:34:30,155 --> 00:34:31,255
Henry, can you hear me?

826
00:34:31,289 --> 00:34:32,189
Y... you're here.

827
00:34:32,224 --> 00:34:34,258
Yes, we're coming to get you.

828
00:34:34,292 --> 00:34:37,028
It's always nice to have,
you know, a team

829
00:34:37,062 --> 00:34:42,967
and a family behind you to fight
for you and fight with you.

830
00:34:43,002 --> 00:34:47,271
Regina's found that in
the Charmings, strangely enough.

831
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,707
Regina and the heroes worked as one.

832
00:34:50,742 --> 00:34:52,609
Pan was stopped.

833
00:34:52,644 --> 00:34:55,046
And Henry was safe.

834
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,480
Hold on, Henry.

835
00:35:00,752 --> 00:35:03,453
And together, they journeyed home.

836
00:35:03,487 --> 00:35:06,356
A lot of the characters
in Neverland this year

837
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,625
are people who lost something.

838
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,694
Their dream was taken from them.

839
00:35:10,728 --> 00:35:13,496
And in a lot of ways,
Neverland showed them

840
00:35:13,531 --> 00:35:15,999
to continue to have faith and believe.

841
00:35:16,034 --> 00:35:17,167
You think it will fly?

842
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:19,202
It has no choice.

843
00:35:19,236 --> 00:35:21,938
Because sometimes
you have to be ready

844
00:35:21,972 --> 00:35:24,907
to receive the happy ending.

845
00:35:24,942 --> 00:35:28,611
And sometimes our happy endings
aren't what we think they are.

846
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:48,649
A triumphant return home
brought family together.

847
00:35:48,683 --> 00:35:50,070
He's back.

848
00:35:50,094 --> 00:35:52,962
You know, I think "Once Upon a Time"
presents family

849
00:35:52,997 --> 00:35:54,998
as something that's extremely important.

850
00:35:57,534 --> 00:36:01,137
It's about family in a world
where anything's possible.

851
00:36:01,964 --> 00:36:04,232
That, at the end of the day,
is most important.

852
00:36:04,266 --> 00:36:07,168
I didn't believe we were all
gonna make it out of that place.

853
00:36:07,202 --> 00:36:09,770
Well, we did.

854
00:36:09,804 --> 00:36:11,772
And we owe a lot of it to her.

855
00:36:11,806 --> 00:36:13,941
Regina helped save us all.

856
00:36:13,975 --> 00:36:15,909
It's not about
going to the ball.

857
00:36:15,944 --> 00:36:17,512
It's not about meeting a prince.

858
00:36:17,546 --> 00:36:19,013
It's about finding home.

859
00:36:19,047 --> 00:36:23,250
But this happy homecoming
included an uninvited guest.

860
00:36:26,521 --> 00:36:29,623
Look at you all... a captive audience.

861
00:36:29,658 --> 00:36:31,258
Hard to tell which one to kill first.

862
00:36:31,292 --> 00:36:33,326
Stay away from them.

863
00:36:33,361 --> 00:36:34,962
For Rumplestiltskin,

864
00:36:34,996 --> 00:36:37,631
he has deep, deep issues
with his father,

865
00:36:37,665 --> 00:36:40,367
and he knows that it's probably
not a confrontation

866
00:36:40,401 --> 00:36:41,934
he's going to survive.

867
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:44,304
I love you, Bae.

868
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:46,105
And I love you, Belle.

869
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,542
You made me stronger.

870
00:36:48,576 --> 00:36:52,679
Everything Rumple has ever done
was to let his son know

871
00:36:52,713 --> 00:36:54,113
that he regretted giving him up,

872
00:36:54,148 --> 00:36:56,849
something his own father
never did for him.

873
00:36:58,986 --> 00:37:00,286
Aah!

874
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,221
In that episode that we saw

875
00:37:02,255 --> 00:37:04,456
when Rumple stabs his father

876
00:37:04,491 --> 00:37:06,993
and... that is just heartbreaking.

877
00:37:07,027 --> 00:37:09,228
But I feel like you have to
break the cycle somewhere,

878
00:37:09,262 --> 00:37:11,263
and that's what he was doing.

879
00:37:11,298 --> 00:37:13,865
What we saw was a man

880
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,368
making the ultimate sacrifice
for his family.

881
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:18,204
Hello, papa.

882
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:20,306
Rumple, please.

883
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,740
We can start over.

884
00:37:21,774 --> 00:37:25,977
We can have a happy ending.

885
00:37:26,012 --> 00:37:29,280
Ah, but I'm a villain.

886
00:37:29,315 --> 00:37:34,385
And villains don't get happy endings.

887
00:37:35,888 --> 00:37:38,656
That's because he maybe thinks
that, "you don't deserve it."

888
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:40,592
And that your actions through your life

889
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:42,828
dictate what you're gonna get
at the end of it.

890
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:50,668
Rumple sacrificed himself

891
00:37:50,703 --> 00:37:53,904
his son, for Belle, and for everybody.

892
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:54,972
He left this world

893
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:57,242
with his son knowing that he loved him.

894
00:37:57,276 --> 00:37:59,110
Rumple!

895
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:01,278
H... he's gone!

896
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:03,781
Despite Rumple's heroism,

897
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:05,515
the damage had already been done.

898
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,451
Pan unleashed Regina's curse...

899
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:08,853
It's here!

900
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:12,056
...which brought an entirely
new set of consequences.

901
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,423
The curse! It's here!

902
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:14,725
It's coming!

903
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,960
There's no escape.

904
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:19,429
I have no choice.
I have to undo what I started.

905
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:22,832
We hear from Regina what
the cost of this curse is,

906
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:26,570
which is that, you know,
she can never see her son again,

907
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:30,073
and our fairy-tale characters
can't come back.

908
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:32,276
Breaking the curse destroys the town.

909
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,744
You'll go back to the Enchanted Forest.

910
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:38,882
All of us... except Henry.

911
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:42,252
You will take him
because you're the Savior.

912
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:46,122
And once again, you can escape it.

913
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:51,894
With these characters,
anything is possible.

914
00:38:51,928 --> 00:38:55,431
Bad can become good, and good
isn't all that it seems to be,

915
00:38:55,465 --> 00:38:57,833
and that all the people in our world

916
00:38:57,867 --> 00:38:59,769
are deserving of a happy ending

917
00:38:59,803 --> 00:39:02,338
no matter what they've been
through or what they've done.

918
00:39:02,372 --> 00:39:03,572
It's all my fault.

919
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:06,508
It wasn't your fault. It's mine.

920
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:08,911
I cast a curse out of vengeance.

921
00:39:08,945 --> 00:39:11,713
I think there's a moral
in all of our stories

922
00:39:11,747 --> 00:39:13,515
that we tell in every episode.

923
00:39:13,549 --> 00:39:15,117
I'm a villain.

924
00:39:15,151 --> 00:39:16,484
You're not a villain.

925
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:18,253
You're my mom.

926
00:39:20,089 --> 00:39:22,657
There's a lot of lessons
to learn from our show,

927
00:39:22,692 --> 00:39:25,126
and that's kind of what fairy
tales were always about anyhow.

928
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,995
There's not a day will go by
I won't think of you.

929
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,364
Good.

930
00:39:29,398 --> 00:39:34,336
"Once Upon a Time"
is a really extensive look

931
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:38,540
at how much hope and faith
it takes to be "happy."

932
00:39:38,574 --> 00:39:43,477
When the curse washes over us,
it will send us all back.

933
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:47,882
Nothing will be left behind,
including your memories.

934
00:39:47,916 --> 00:39:50,151
When you cross that town line,

935
00:39:50,185 --> 00:39:52,353
you will have the life
you always wanted.

936
00:39:52,387 --> 00:39:55,389
It's about hope,
and it's always been about hope.

937
00:39:55,423 --> 00:39:59,827
And it's about the belief that
no matter how bad things are,

938
00:39:59,861 --> 00:40:01,862
no matter how bad things seem,

939
00:40:01,896 --> 00:40:04,732
if you just keep that faith
and you keep that belief,

940
00:40:04,766 --> 00:40:09,570
someday they'll get better.

941
00:40:09,604 --> 00:40:12,239
It's how you get to it
that can be the challenge

942
00:40:12,273 --> 00:40:15,308
and what you do with it when
you get it that's important.

943
00:40:20,281 --> 00:40:22,448
We really wanted the season

944
00:40:22,483 --> 00:40:24,384
to feel like two different seasons.

945
00:40:24,418 --> 00:40:27,120
So the first half was really
concentrated on Neverland,

946
00:40:27,154 --> 00:40:29,188
and it was about belief.

947
00:40:29,222 --> 00:40:31,223
And the second half of the season

948
00:40:31,258 --> 00:40:33,826
is really going to explore
what "home" means.

949
00:40:33,861 --> 00:40:36,328
And we always said when we created Emma

950
00:40:36,363 --> 00:40:38,998
that she was a character
looking for home.

951
00:40:39,032 --> 00:40:41,967
But because she never had one,
she doesn't know what it is.

952
00:41:04,189 --> 00:41:05,624
Someone coming over?

953
00:41:05,658 --> 00:41:07,392
No.

954
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:10,495
Henry, wait here.

955
00:41:15,167 --> 00:41:16,635
Swan.

956
00:41:17,503 --> 00:41:19,470
- At last.
- W... do I know you?

957
00:41:19,504 --> 00:41:21,439
Look. I need your help.
Something's happened...

958
00:41:21,473 --> 00:41:23,474
something terrible...
your family is in trouble.

959
00:41:23,508 --> 00:41:25,509
My family's right here. Who are you?

960
00:41:25,544 --> 00:41:26,844
An old friend.

961
00:41:26,878 --> 00:41:31,049
I know you can't remember me,
but... I can make you.

962
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,085
Unh!

963
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:35,653
What the hell are you doing?

964
00:41:35,687 --> 00:41:38,288
A long shot. I had to try.
I was hoping you felt as I did.

965
00:41:38,323 --> 00:41:41,158
All you're gonna feel is the
handcuffs when I call the cops.

966
00:41:41,192 --> 00:41:42,860
Look, I know this seems crazy,

967
00:41:42,894 --> 00:41:44,361
but you have to listen to me.

968
00:41:44,395 --> 00:41:45,663
You have to remem...

969
00:41:46,865 --> 00:41:48,732
- Who was that?
- No idea.

970
00:41:48,767 --> 00:41:51,335
Someone must have left
the door open downstairs.

971
00:41:51,369 --> 00:41:53,636
Come on. Let's eat.

972
00:41:53,708 --> 00:42:13,708
