1
00:00:00,801 --> 00:00:04,338
- THE LAWN MOWER REALLY HELPS.

2
00:00:10,078 --> 00:00:11,579
* I GO TO WORK

3
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:13,447
* ALTHOUGH I HATE MY JOB

4
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:16,117
* BUT HATING YOUR JOB

5
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:21,389
* IS BETTER THAN NO JOB AT ALL *

6
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:24,292
* I WANT AN iPOD

7
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:26,194

8
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:28,329
* BUT I CAN'T AFFORD IT

9
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:32,700
* I CAN'T AFFORD THINGS
THAT ARE COOL *

10
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:38,139

00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:42,210
* A BETTER ME

12
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:47,815
* BUT CHANGE
TAKES TOO MUCH ENERGY *

13
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:50,251
* SO WHY TRY?

14
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:52,453
* IT'S TOO HARD TO TRY

15
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:54,322
* SO WHY TRY?

16
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:57,625
* WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE

17
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:02,830
* I GOT TWO FRIENDS

18
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:05,199
* AND THEY'RE KINDA BORING

19
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:07,135
* BUT I'M KINDA BORING

20
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:10,171
* I GUESS THAT'S WHY
I HAVE BORING FRIENDS *

21
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,243
* I WANNA BE FUNNY

22
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:16,877
* LIKE THOSE GUYS ON TV

23
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,547
* WHEN I PULL DOWN MY PANTS *

24
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,781
* MY MOM DOESN'T LAUGH

25
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:26,754
* AT MY JOKES

26
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:32,760
* I WANNA WORK TOWARD
A BETTER ME *

27
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:38,766
* BUT CHANGE
TAKES TOO MUCH ENERGY *

28
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,302
* SO WHY TRY?

29
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,637
* IT'S TOO HARD TO TRY

30
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:45,906
* WHY TRY?

31
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,242
* WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE

32
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,198
* GIRLS ARE REAL CUTE

33
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:12,200
* BUT I CAN'T TALK TO GIRLS

34
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:14,702
* I GET REALLY SCARED

35
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,270
* THE PRIEST EVEN TOLD ME *

36
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:18,372
* I'M GAY

37
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:29,850
- WELL... THIS IS AWKWARD.

38
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,186
- NOT AN EVERY DAY OCCURRENCE.

39
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,555
THAT'S FOR SURE.

40
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:38,592
- I SUPPOSE INTRODUCTIONS
ARE IN ORDER.

41
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:42,330
GREGORY.

42
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:45,366
- GARY.

43
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:49,370
Male narrator: AND SO BEGAN
THE WARM STORY

44
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:53,241
OF HOW TWO SERIAL KILLERS
BECAME BUDDIES.

45
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:55,676
SERIAL BUDDIES.

46
00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:00,214
GREGORY VON GEARHART
WAS A RELIGIOUS MAN.

47
00:03:00,248 --> 00:03:03,484
HE EVEN CALLED
THE CHURCH HOME...

48
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,953
BECAUSE IT WAS.

49
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,822
HE WAS A LIVE-IN MAID.

50
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,727
IT WAS SPRING BREAK

51
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:16,430
AND GREGORY COULDN'T WAIT
TO GET HIS WORK DONE.

52
00:03:16,464 --> 00:03:18,799
FATHER CHRISTOPHER
WAS ALSO EXCITED...

53
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:25,773
narrator: BECAUSE IT MEANT
A WHOLE WEEK WITHOUT GREGORY.

54
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:29,677
- GOOD MORNING, FATHER.

55
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,413
MAY I PRESENT YOU WITH
MY FAREWELL EASTER BASKET?

56
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:34,014
- WOW, SUPER.

57
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,250
JUST PUT IT
WITH THE OTHERS YOU MADE.

58
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:40,454
Narrator: MEANWHILE,
GARY "BIG MAC" MACARELLI

59
00:03:40,488 --> 00:03:43,757
WAS ALSO GOING TO WORK.

60
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:48,729
HE WAS PUNCTUAL, STYLISH,

61
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:52,700
AND AS ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S
ELITE TROPHY MAKERS,

62
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,537
HE WAS PROUD TO WEAR THE COLORS.

63
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:00,441
GARY WAS ALSO
EAGER TO FINISH WORK...

64
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:05,913
AND HEAD OUT ON A SPRING BREAK
OF HIS OWN.

65
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:11,552
- HEY, CHIEF.

66
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:16,056
- MARIA.

67
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,793
- NO, NO.
IT'S STILL A COLLEGE RING.

68
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:21,028
YEP.

69
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:23,497
OKAY.

70
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:24,965
- RING, RING.

71
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,767
I'LL GET IT.

72
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,302
HELLO? GREGORY SPEAKING.

73
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:30,037
OH, HI, JESUS, HOW ARE YOU?

74
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,039
YOU LIKE MY EASTER BASKETS?

75
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,074
YOU WANT ME TO MAKE MORE?

76
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,910
I'LL BE SURE TO LET THEM KNOW.

77
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,684
OH, AND GOOD LUCK
WITH THE ASCENSION.

78
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:46,420
ALL RIGHT, BYE-BYE NOW.

79
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:49,623
- CHIEF, I BLEW THE MOTHBALLS
OFF THE OLD SPRING BREAK JUMPER.

80
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:52,059
HOW DO YOU LIKE ME NOW?

81
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,504
- FATHER, I KNOW YOU
AND THE OTHER PARISHIONERS

82
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:04,872
DESPERATELY WANT ME TO STAY,

83
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,049
BUT I'M AFRAID
I'M UNDER STRICT ORDERS

84
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:08,075
TO BEGIN MY PILGRIMAGE.

85
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,578
- THE CHURCH DOESN'T
SEND PEOPLE ON PILGRIMAGES.

86
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:13,614
IS THAT MY STOLE?

87
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:17,618
- JUST IN TIME.

88
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,455
GARY, THIS IS MY NEPHEW.

89
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:24,892
HE WANTS TO BREAK INTO
THE TROPHY BUSINESS.

90
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,060
- MY DAD FINALLY SIGNED
MY PERMISSION SLIP.

91
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:38,706
- FATHER, YOU KNOW
I FULLY RESPECT THE CHURCH.

92
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:42,142
WHY, AS AN ALTAR BOY,
I WAS PRACTICALLY RAISED

93
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:47,881
BY THE WANDERING,
LOVING HANDS OF PRIESTS.

94
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:49,950
BUT I'M AFRAID...

95
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:53,987
I DON'T WORK FOR THE CHURCH.

96
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:58,992
I WORK FOR GOD.

97
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,161
- I'M HOPING
YOU'LL BE MY MENTOR.

98
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,497
GRAMPS SAYS
YOU'RE THE BEST EVER.

99
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:06,567
KRAVELLO WAS THE BEST EVER.

100
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:14,975
- ONE AND TWO,
AND ONE AND TWO, AND TURN.

101
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,578
Narrator: AND THAT'S
WHEN FATE STEPPED IN

102
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,179
IN THE FORM OF A NEWS REPORT.

103
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,681
- I'M EMILY FRANCES.

104
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,115
CONTROVERSY IS BREWING

105
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,418
AT LACONIA'S ANNUAL
SPRINGLE BELL TOY RUN

106
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:25,753
FOR UNDERPRIVILEGED YOUTH.

107
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,421
IN ATTENDANCE
AT NEXT WEEK'S EVENT

108
00:06:27,455 --> 00:06:28,822
WILL BE INFAMOUS
MOTORCYCLE OUTLAW

109
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:30,991
RALPH "BIG CHICKEN" MORELLI.

110
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:32,860
RECENTLY PAROLED,
BIG CHICKEN LED

111
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,895
THE CHELSEA WHITE DEVILS
IN THEIR HEYDAY

112
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:38,799
WHEN THE GANG, OR "CLUB,"
RIVALED THE HELL'S ANGELS.

113
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:41,802
THE WHITE DEVILS ARE EXPECTED
TO HAVE GATHERED THE MOST TOYS,

114
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:46,940
WITH BIG CHICKEN RECEIVING
THE EVENT'S TOP TROPHY.

115
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:04,825
Narrator: CLEARLY, THE BUDDIES

116
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,193
HAD DIFFERENT REASONS
FOR KILLING.

117
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:08,462
ONE THING WAS FOR SURE:

118
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:12,099
THEY BOTH WERE DETERMINED
TO GET BIG CHICKEN.

119
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:16,103
SPRING BREAK
HAD OFFICIALLY BEGUN.

120
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,012
ALONG THE WAY,

121
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:29,116
GREGORY CAME UPON
A HAUNTED HOUSE OF ALL THINGS.

122
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:37,525
TO GREGORY, HAUNTED HOUSES

123
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:40,661
WERE JUST
THE DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND,

124
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:44,632
AND SOMEONE WOULD HAVE TO PAY.

125
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:48,068
MEANWHILE,
GARY CAME UPON A VEHICLE

126
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,904
OWNED BY A MULTI-SPORT ATHLETE.

127
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:26,807
Narrator: AND THIS
BRINGS US BACK TO THE WOODS,

128
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,176
WHERE OUR NEWLY ACQUAINTED
SERIAL BUDDIES

129
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,845
WERE BURYING
THEIR RESPECTIVE KILLS.

130
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,181
Both: I WAS JUST...

131
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:36,917
YOU GO FIRST.

132
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:41,054
- JUST A LITTLE ME TIME
AFTER THE LENTEN MADNESS.

133
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:43,957
- I'M ON SPRING BREAK
FROM WORK TOO.

134
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:46,727
HEADED UP TO LACONIA...
FOR TOY RUN.

135
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,229
- WELL, THIS JUST
GETS CRAZIER AND CRAZIER.

136
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,899
I'M HEADED TO THE SPRINGLE BELL
TOY RUN AS WELL.

137
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:56,136
- WELL, I GUESS
I'LL JUST DIG MY HOLE THEN.

138
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,038
- OH, DON'T BE SILLY.

139
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:01,975
THERE'S... THERE'S
PLENTY OF ROOM FOR TWO.

140
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,552
- SIR, YOU FORGOT YOUR WALLET.

141
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,660
I'M SORRY I FOLLOWED YOU.

142
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,194
- YOU'RE GONNA PAY
FOR THIS, ROOKIE!

143
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,598
- I WON'T SAY ANYTHING! I SWEAR!

144
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,636
- BACK OFF, CIVILIAN.
THIS DOESN'T CONCERN YOU.

145
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,137
- MY GOODNESS, YOU'RE NOT GOING

146
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,280
TO KILL THE POOR LAD, ARE YOU?

147
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:35,776
- BACK OFF I SAID!

148
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:38,145
SO YOU WANT ME
TO BE YOUR MENTOR?

149
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,780
YOU WANNA BE MY INTERN?

150
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:42,015
YOU DO EVERYTHING I SAY
FROM THIS MOMENT FORWARD.

151
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:44,384
PICK UP THAT SHOVEL.

152
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,622
NOW MARCH!

153
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:50,758
HE WON'T SAY A WORD.

154
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,893
THAT IS, IF HE WANTS ME
TO BE HIS MENTOR.

155
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,128
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
- YOU WOULDN'T.

156
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,797
THE INTERN-MENTOR RELATIONSHIP

157
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,332
IS A SACRED BOND TO WE
OLD SCHOOL TROPHY MAKERS,

158
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:03,603
FORGED CENTURIES
BEFORE YOU WERE EVEN BORN.

159
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,222
- OH.

160
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:24,257
CASTOREUM.

161
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,127
IT KEEPS ANIMALS
FROM DIGGING UP THE REMAINS.

162
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,428
WHOOP.

163
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,698
BEAVERS SECRETE IT
FROM THEIR CASTOR GLANDS

164
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:32,099
TO REPEL PREDATORS.

165
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,401
IT'S A WONDERFUL
FERTILIZER TOO, HOWEVER.

166
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:38,105
WHICH KEEPS
THE WHOLE PROCESS GREEN.

167
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,410
- ARE YOU ONE OF THEM SCIENTIFIC
GENIUSES OR SOMETHING?

168
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,713
- WELL, IF YOU CONSIDER
BEING A SUMMA CUM LAUDE

169
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:49,983
FROM HARVARD UNIVERSITY
A GENIUS, THEN PERHAPS I AM.

170
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:52,285
BUT A SCIENTIST? A DARWINIAN?

171
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,322
HEAVENS NO. I AM A MAN OF GOD.

172
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,890
- OH.

173
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:59,026
- NOW I'M SORRY,
BUT IN ALL THIS CONFUSION,

174
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,828
I DIDN'T CATCH YOUR NAME.

175
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,171
- OH...
- THAT'S 'CAUSE HE ONLY SPEAKS

176
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:03,463
WHEN SPOKEN TO.

177
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,099
- WELL, I JUST SPOKE TO HIM.

178
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,801
- I DON'T NEED THAT ON ME.

179
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:09,402
I DON'T NEED THAT ON ME!

180
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:10,738
QUIT IT!

181
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,339
THAT'S IT, I'M OUT OF HERE.

182
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:13,941
I GOTTA GET
TO THE SPRINGLE BELL TOY RUN

183
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:15,943
AND TAKE OUT BIG CHICKEN.

184
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:18,145
- WAIT, GARY, HOLD UP.

185
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,481
DID I JUST HEAR YOU SAY
"BIG CHICKEN"?

186
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,251
AS IN BIG CHICKEN, EVIL OUTLAW
JUST RELEASED FROM PRISON?

187
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,153
- AS IN BIG CHICKEN,

188
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,088
PREDICTED TO WIN
THE SPRINGLE BELL TOY RUN.

189
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,390
- OH, GARY.

190
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,925
WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER.

191
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,260
WE... WE DO THE SAME WORK.

192
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:34,494
WE HAVE THE SAME SPRING BREAK.

193
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,463
AND WE'RE BOTH OFF TO LACONIA

194
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,498
TO TAKE OUT BIG CHICKEN.

195
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,968
AND WE'VE BEEN GIVEN AN INTERN.

196
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:42,736
OH.

197
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:46,206
- ME SPEND MY SPRING BREAK
WITH A ROOKIE?

198
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,175
YEAH, RIGHT.

199
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,879
LISTEN, OUT OF RESPECT
TO MR. PRELL,

200
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:53,947
YOUR GRANDFATHER AND MY BOSS,

201
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:56,784
I'M GIVING YOU A RIDE
TO THE TRAIN STATION...

202
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:58,318
AND YOU'RE GOING WITH HIM.

203
00:11:58,351 --> 00:11:59,820
- OH, BUT WE COULD HELP.

204
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:01,488
- I DON'T NEED HELP.

205
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:04,491
I WORK ALONE.

206
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:18,772
- PERMISSION
TO SPEAK FREELY, SIR?

207
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:22,142
BACK IN THE DAY, ALL
GRANDPA PRELL EVER TALKED ABOUT

208
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:25,312
WAS THE MADCAP ADVENTURES
OF GARY "MAC" MACARELLI

209
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:27,147
AND KENNY "FRY" KRAVELLO.

210
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,984
- DUMB NAMES THE PRESS GAVE
MY OLD PARTNER KRAVELLO AND ME.

211
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:32,561
GRAMPS USED TO GO ON AND ON
ABOUT ALL THE RECORDS

212
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,354
YOU GUYS SET FOR ASSEMBLY TIMES.

213
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:35,889
- NOT TO MENTION
ALL THE GROUPIES

214
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,424
AND PARTIES BACK THEN.

215
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,993
OOH.

216
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:41,895
WHAT'S YOUR POINT, ROOKIE?

217
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:43,807
- I'VE WAITED MY WHOLE LIFE
TO LEARN THE TROPHY BUSINESS,

218
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:46,099
AND NOW THAT KRAVELLO'S GONE

219
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:50,437
AND GRANDPA PRELL'S MORE OR LESS
LOST IT, I JUST WANNA...

220
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,474
- MR. PRELL
IS AS RAZOR SHARP AS EVER.

221
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,012
- DON'T YOU EVER DISRESPECT HIM.

222
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:00,280
GOT IT?

223
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:01,281
- SIEG. all: HEIL.

224
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:02,916
- SKINHEADS.

225
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,284
- SIEG. all: HEIL.

226
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:07,220
- AS IF THE GOOD LORD
HAND-DELIVERED THEM.

227
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:10,190
MY DOCTOR'S BAG, STAT!

228
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:14,294
GARY, OUR FATHER
IN HEAVEN BECKONS ALREADY.

229
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:17,097
WE HAVE SKINHEADS UPON US.

230
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:21,068
RACIST EVILDOERS
WHO MUST BE ELIMINATED.

231
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:23,070
- YOU GO TO IT, BLONDIE.

232
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:26,506
BUT JUST REMEMBER, ACCORDING
TO THE CALCULATOR WATCH...

233
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,977
THIS SLED LEAVES IN FIVE.

234
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,079
GOT IT?

235
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:33,246
- FINE.

236
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,215
Narrator:
UNBEKNOWNST TO GREGORY,

237
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,350
THESE SKINHEADS
WERE FAR MORE DANGEROUS

238
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:39,252
THAN ORDINARY SKINHEADS.

239
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:42,355
THEY WERE THE SKINHEADS
FOR BETTER TELEVISION.

240
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,591
- WE NEED MORE
WHITE PEOPLE SHOWS

241
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:48,261
LIKE FRIENDS, FULL HOUSE,
AND THE HILLS.

242
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:50,397
All: THE HILLS.

243
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,133
- TODAY, WE DECLARE SKIN-HAD,

244
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:58,238
BEGINNING WITH THIS LOCAL
JEWISH INTERNET FILM CRITIC.

245
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:03,276
- INTERNET FILM CRITIC?

246
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:08,515
EVERYONE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO SEE ME.

247
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,550
GENTLEMEN, GOOD DAY.

248
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,085
MY NAME IS GREGORY

249
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:13,954
AND I'M CURRENTLY
ON A PILGRIMAGE

250
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:16,456
GRANTING DOOMED SOULS,
SUCH AS YOURS,

251
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:20,560
SAFE PASSAGE TO HEAVEN
VIA LETHAL POISON,

252
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,596
WHICH I MIX WITH A TASTY,
REFRESHING BOXED FRUIT DRINK

253
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,100
TO CALCIFY YOUR NERVES.

254
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:30,203
- BOYS, I THINK WHAT
WE HAVE HERE IS AN F.P.

255
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:31,972
- AN F.P.?

256
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,606
WELL, I'M NOT FAMILIAR
WITH THAT TERM.

257
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,442
- "FREE PLAY."

258
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,610
THAT'S WHEN YOU GET TO BEAT
THE PISS OUT OF SOMEBODY

259
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:39,112
WITHOUT HAVING TO ANSWER FOR IT.

260
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:40,447
- OOH.

261
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,480
OH...

262
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:45,418
- NOT THE FACE!
JUST NOT THE FACE!

263
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:48,055
YOU CAN'T BUY
THIS BONE STRUCTURE.

264
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49,422
- DID YOU KNOW THE ROTARY

265
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:52,993
DOES A SKINHEAD OF THE YEAR
AWARD NOW?

266
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:56,396
- PROBABLY JUST GIVE OUT
SOME CHEAP RIBBON OR SOMETHING.

267
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:59,366
- ACTUALLY, THE... THE WINNER
GETS A SILVER TROPHY

268
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,935
WITH A GIANT FIGURINE HITLER
ON TOP.

269
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:05,105
NEXT YEAR, THEY'RE EXPANDING
TO INCLUDE SUPERLATIVES.

270
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:09,076
YOU KNOW, BEST-DRESSED SKINHEAD,
MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED,

271
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:10,677
BIGGEST FLIRT.

272
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,084
NO TIME TO BURY THE BODIES.
GOT A TRAIN TO CATCH.

273
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,163
- GARY, YOUR STRENGTH.

274
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:06,633
IT WAS LIKE... SAMSON.

275
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:10,203
Narrator: SEEING GARY
ANNIHILATE THE SKINHEADS

276
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:12,772
BROUGHT A POSITIVE VIBE
TO THE BUDDIES.

277
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,508
IT ALSO MADE GREGORY
MISTAKENLY BELIEVE

278
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:18,445
THAT THE TWO WERE KILLING
FOR THE SAME REASON.

279
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,613
- GARY, IT WAS NO ACCIDENT
THAT WE MET,

280
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,649
AND IT WAS NO ACCIDENT
THAT YOU STOPPED THE CAR

281
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:24,384
BACK THERE OF ALL PLACES.

282
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:27,587
AND WERE IT NOT FOR
MY CLEVERLY PLAYING POSSUM,

283
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,156
WELL, THEN YOU WOULD NOT
HAVE BEEN ABLE

284
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:31,758
TO TAKE THEM BY SURPRISE.

285
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,560
DON'T YOU SEE
WHAT ALL THIS ADDS UP TO?

286
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,462
WE SHOULD JOIN FORCES.

287
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,297
- I WORK ALONE.

288
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,532
- HAVE YOU NOT LISTENED
TO ANYTHING THAT I'VE SAID?

289
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:44,304
DON'T YOU SEE IT'S GOD'S WILL
FOR US TO WORK TOGETHER?

290
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:48,341
- GONNA MISS YOUR TRAIN.

291
00:16:56,683 --> 00:17:01,688
- SO THAT'S HOW YOU'D LIKE
TO PLAY IT, IS IT?

292
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,726
GARY...

293
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,795
I COULD, OF COURSE,
USE MY STANDING IN THE CHURCH

294
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:11,364
TO BAN YOU FROM
RECEIVING HOLY COMMUNION.

295
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:13,166
- HUH?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

296
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,304
BANNED, ALONG WITH DIVORCEES
AND WOMEN WHO HAVE OPINIONS.

297
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:19,139
- OOH.

298
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:24,277
- I COULD THEN APPEAL
TO ANOTHER FORM OF "AUTHORITAY"

299
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:26,713
AND TELL THEM...

300
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,482
EVERYTHING.

301
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:32,619
AND I THINK YOU KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN.

302
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:37,124
- YOU'D WRITE AN OFFICIAL LETTER
OF COMPLAINT TO MR. TROPHY?

303
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:40,827
- INDEED, I WOULD.
TO A MR. PRELL, WAS IT?

304
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,130
- YOU'D GO THAT FAR?

305
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:45,832
- I COULD GO THAT FAR,
BUT I WON'T.

306
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:48,568
CONSIDER THAT
AS YOU CAST ME OFF,

307
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:52,572
SOMEONE PROVEN
TO HELP YOU GET BIG CHICKEN.

308
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:55,542
MENTOR.

309
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,386
I MAY HAVE A LOT TO LEARN
ABOUT THE TROPHY BUSINESS,

310
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:02,415
BUT I KNOW I CAN HELP.

311
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:13,126
- THERE'S NO NEED, GRAHAM.

312
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,664
HE WORKS ALONE.

313
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:23,570
- WAIT!

314
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:32,279
GET IN.

315
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:34,747
WE AIN'T GOT ALL DAY.

316
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,883
Narrator: IT WAS SETTLED.

317
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,818
THE BUDDIES WOULD JOIN FORCES,

318
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,488
WITH GREGORY BELIEVING
THEY WERE KILLING FOR GOD

319
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:43,156
AND GARY THINKING
THEY WERE KILLING

320
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,924
POTENTIAL TROPHY WINNERS.

321
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,394
BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER... YET.

322
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:49,562
FOR NOW, THEY HAD
MORE PRESSING MATTERS.

323
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:51,364
WARDROBE CHANGE.

324
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:53,266
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA LOVE
MY NEXT OUTFIT.

325
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,502
BY THE WAY, GARY,
LOVE THE JUMPSUIT.

326
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:56,936
SO FASHION FORWARD.

327
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,369
YOU KNOW THE THING
ABOUT MODELING...

328
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:36,243
- IN THE CAR NOW!

329
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:39,579
AROUND THE OTHER SIDE.

330
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:42,949
THAT VAN'S FULL OF ACHIEVERS.

331
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:44,651
WE GOTTA TAKE 'EM OUT.

332
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,553
- BUT GARY, THEY'RE
JUST FRATERNITY STUDENTS.

333
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:48,855
- STUDENTS WITH A LIFETIME

334
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:54,261
FULL OF ACHIEVEMENTS
AND CONQUESTS AHEAD OF 'EM.

335
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:56,563
FINE, I'LL TAKE 'EM OUT MYSELF.

336
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:58,531
- BUT MENTOR,
THERE ARE FIVE OF THEM

337
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:00,233
AND ONLY ONE OF YOU.

338
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:03,336
- ROOKIE, IT AIN'T
HOW HARD YOU GET HIT.

339
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:07,940
IT'S HOW HARD YOU CAN GET HIT
AND KEEP MOVING FORWARD.

340
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:09,476
Narrator:
A LINE FROM ROCKY BALBOA,

341
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:11,744
A FAVORITE MOVIE
AMONGST TROPHY MAKERS.

342
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:13,346
- SIX 20-YEAR-OLDS.

343
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,416
40 YEARS OF COMPETITION.

344
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:19,919
2.3 AWARDS PER YEAR.

345
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,464
Narrator: AND THAT'S
PROBABLY WHERE COMPARISONS

346
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:24,357
TO GARY AND ROCKY BALBOA END.

347
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:35,335
- I MUST ADMIT,
I DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND

348
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:36,903
THE WAY OF THE TROPHY MAKER
JUST YET,

349
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:40,407
BUT WHAT HE'S ATTEMPTING,
IT'S MURDER.

350
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,275
- IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

351
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:44,611
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT
YET EITHER.

352
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:46,879
I SAY LET THOSE JOCKS
GO TO THAT SORORITY

353
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,581
WITH THEIR LAME DATE RAPE DRUG

354
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:50,550
SO WE CAN GET BACK ON COURSE.

355
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,686
- SORORITY? DATE RAPE DRUG?

356
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,956
- YEAH, I HEARD 'EM
TALK ABOUT IT ON PEE BREAK.

357
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:02,829
- I'M COMING, GARY.

358
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:04,664
- MENTOR!

359
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:06,599
- I THINK HE MIGHT BE DEAD.

360
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:08,000
- SELF DEFENSE, BRO.

361
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:09,769
RIGHT? RIGHT?

362
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:11,571
- GENTLEMEN, RELAX.

363
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,940
I HAVE A MEDICAL BACKGROUND.

364
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:17,076
GRAHAM, REFRESHING
BOXED FRUIT DRINK, PLEASE.

365
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,479
30ccs OF MEYER LEMON PRUNE.

366
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:21,648
NO, WAIT, APPLE WALNUT BERRY.

367
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:23,383
ITS CLOTTING EFFECTS
ARE STRONGER.

368
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:26,619
MM-HMM. OH, WOW.

369
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:29,722
OH, IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE
I'VE SEEN A CASE LIKE THIS.

370
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:31,591
GENTLEMEN, I'M AFRAID
I'M GOING TO NEED ACCESS

371
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,593
TO YOUR TEAM'S MEDICAL KIT.

372
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:37,063
I NEED AN ICE PACK AND A ROLL
OF STRETCHABLE GAUZE.

373
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:40,867
SOMEBODY, PLEASE?

374
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,836
LEAVE ME.

375
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:49,576
OH, WHY THANK YOU.

376
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:54,514
AND THAT SHOULD DO IT.

377
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:56,082
TAKE THAT, PLEASE.

378
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:57,750
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

379
00:21:57,784 --> 00:21:58,818
ARE WE DONE HERE?

380
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:00,687
CAN WE LEAVE? - UH, YES.

381
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,357
OH, WAIT.

382
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:07,026
DEAR LORD,
PLEASE FORGIVE THESE BOYS

383
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,996
FOR THE SINS
THAT THEY WISH TO COMMIT.

384
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:14,066
AMEN.

385
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:17,103
NOW WE'RE DONE.

386
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:19,506
OKAY, GRAHAM, COME ON.

387
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:28,815
I STUDIED AT
THE KAZOO CONSERVATORY...

388
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:34,120
AND ATTENDED
KAZOO CAMP EACH SUMMER,

389
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:36,389
UNTIL ONE OF THE CAMP COUNSELORS

390
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:38,858
FONDLED MY KAZOO.

391
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,995
OH.

392
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:46,766
- YOU... YOU THINK WE SHOULD
USE THAT ICE PACK FOR MENTOR?

393
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,767
- OH, NO, NO.

394
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,068
HE'LL BE FINE.

395
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,638
- I DON'T KNOW
IF MENTOR WANTS US

396
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:52,981
TO MESS AROUND
WITH HIS EQUIPMENT.

397
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:54,507
- OH, NO, NO.

398
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,976
THE, UH, STEREO VIBRATIONS
AND SO FORTH

399
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:59,946
WILL HELP ACTIVATE
THE NEURONS IN HIS BRAIN.

400
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:02,782
- WOW, YOU SOME
KIND OF DOCTOR TOO?

401
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:05,151
- WELL, MY GRANDFATHER,
FATHER, AND BROTHER ARE,

402
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:08,421
AND THOUGH I COULD DISSECT
A FROG LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS,

403
00:23:08,455 --> 00:23:10,790
IT REALLY WASN'T FOR ME.

404
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:12,825
WEE BIT OF THE BLACK SHEEP,
I'M AFRAID.

405
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,527
- I KNOW THE FEELING.

406
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:16,195
ALL MY BROTHERS
ARE AMAZING ATHLETES.

407
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:20,867
BUT MR. TROPHY CONSTRUCTED
382 OF THEIR TROPHIES.

408
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,935
I WAS ALWAYS MORE INTO
THE TROPHIES THEY WON

409
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:24,437
THAN THE SPORTS THEY PLAYED.

410
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:26,573
- NOT THAT CLOSE, I TAKE IT?

411
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:31,611
Narrator: NOT CLOSE AT ALL.

412
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:36,649
HE MAY NOT LOOK LIKE IT NOW,

413
00:23:36,683 --> 00:23:39,151
BUT GRAHAM'S STEP BROTHER,
GOLDEN GRAHAM,

414
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:42,054
WAS A BIG-TIME TROPHY WINNER.

415
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:45,157
THESE DAYS, HE WAS MUCH MORE
CONTENT TALKING ABOUT THE PAST.

416
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:48,928
- HEY, STAVROS, YOUR KIDS
GOING AWAY FOR SPRING BREAK?

417
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:51,664
YOU KNOW, PANAMA CITY, CANCUN?

418
00:23:51,698 --> 00:23:55,234
BACK IN THE DAY, ME AND MY BOYS
USED TO ROCK FORT LAUDERDALE.

419
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,705
BABY GORILLA.

420
00:23:58,738 --> 00:24:01,574
- FIX THE LAWN MOWER,
YOU LOUSY GREEK.

421
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:05,612
- AH.
- AH. AH.

422
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:09,115
- HI, STAVROS.

423
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:11,017
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

424
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,852
- TO START MY NEW JOB.

425
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:14,954
- YOU GOT A JOB,
BEING MENTALLY DISABLED

426
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:17,023
SO THE GOVERNMENT SENDS POP
A CHECK ONCE A MONTH.

427
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:19,759
YOU KNOW, BEING BORN STUPID
PAYS VERY WELL.

428
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:23,129
- AH. YEAH.
LIKE A LITTLE BROAD. AH.

429
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:24,831
GET OUT OF HERE.

430
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:26,833
YOU LOOK GREAT THOUGH.

431
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:28,010
BEAUTIFUL OUTFIT. IT MATCHES.

432
00:24:28,034 --> 00:24:32,471
JERKOFF.

433
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:42,515
Narrator: GRAHAM HAD NO CHOICE
BUT TO RUN AWAY FROM HOME.

434
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:45,217
IN MANY WAYS,
HIS LAST CHANCE AT HAPPINESS

435
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:47,286
WAS AT MR. TROPHY WITH GARY.

436
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,855
- FINALLY, HE WAKES.

437
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:50,590
- SHOW HIM THE BEANSTALK CHART.

438
00:24:50,623 --> 00:24:52,725
- OH, YES.

439
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:55,227
JUST A FUN WAY
TO CHART OUR PROGRESS.

440
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:58,931
WE COLOR IN A PIECE OF THE STALK
AFTER EVERY TEN KILLS,

441
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:00,933
MAKING SURE TO COLOR
THE ENTIRE STALK

442
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:03,202
BEFORE WE GET TO BIG CHICKEN.

443
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:11,210
- HUH?

444
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,912
THE JOCKS FROM THE FRATERNITY.

445
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:15,047
- YES, YOU'LL NOTICE
THEY'RE QUITE DEAD.

446
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:17,550
I INSERTED A LETHAL MIX
OF ALCOHOL AND IODINE

447
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:19,952
INTO THE AIR VENTS.

448
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:26,826
GARY, HAD YOU SPECIFIED TO ME

449
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,761
WHAT YOU MEANT BY
"THEIR CONQUESTS,"

450
00:25:28,795 --> 00:25:32,331
YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN HURT.

451
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:37,704
IS THAT FOOD I SMELL?

452
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:40,206
- IT CERTAINLY IS.

453
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,608
Narrator: THE SEEDS
OF FRIENDSHIP

454
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:43,175

455
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,177

UH, NEURONS ACTIVATED.

461

narrator: WHILE OUR BUDDIES
WERE BUSY BONDING,

490
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:24,811
THE AREA HAD SEEN A SURGE
IN MISSING CHILDREN,

491
00:27:24,844 --> 00:27:27,279
AND NOBODY WAS PAID TO CARE MORE

492
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:30,416
THAN TV'S KATHIE LEE GIFFORD.

493
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:32,952
TODAY IN THE COMMON ROOM.

494
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,286
All: LAMBDAS!

495
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,756

AS A PAID SPOKESPERSON

496
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:40,359
FOR GOTJARED.COM

497
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:43,229
NOW, YOU ALL KNOW THAT JARED
WAS RECENTLY ABDUCTED,

498
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:44,897
AND I THINK IT IS OUR DUTY

499
00:27:44,931 --> 00:27:46,966
TO DO EVERYTHING
WE CAN TO HELP HIM.

500
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:50,369
CAN ANYONE HERE TELL ME WHY?

501
00:27:51,738 --> 00:27:53,239
- BECAUSE WITH ALL GREAT POWER

502
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:55,441
COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY.

503
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:56,976
- NO.

504
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:01,413
BECAUSE IT'S
A TERRIFIC TOOL FOR...

505
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:02,949
NETWORKING.

506
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:04,350

YOU'RE OUT THERE,

AND YOU ARE NOT ONLY
RAISING AWARENESS

510
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:14,794

BUT ALSO, THE BEST PART:

511
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:18,831
3% OF ALL THE NET SALES
GO TO CHARITY.

512
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:22,334
3%!

513
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:26,372

SORRY ENOUGH TO GO OUT WITH YOU.

* MY BODY BRUISED,
BEEN RIDICULOUS *

609
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:27,706

"DON'T WORRY,

613
00:33:37,283 --> 00:33:39,451
THESE SLACKS
ARE STAIN RESISTANT."

614
00:33:47,593 --> 00:33:48,560

- BUT I BROUGHT
THIS PICTURE FOR YOU, GARY.

622
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:13,652
Narrator: EVEN THOUGH
GARY HAD NEVER MET LISA,

623
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:16,555
ALL HE HAD TO DO
WAS TAKE ONE LOOK AT HER.

624
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:18,690
- YOU'RE DEAD?

625
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:21,493
Narrator: GARY WAS NOW
MADLY IN LOVE WITH LISA.

626
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:24,463

WHY, GOD?

00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:32,204
OH, NO.

narrator:
THEY'RE FIGMENTS OF GARY'S

634
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:52,858
INSTANT AND INEXPLICABLE
ROMANCE WITH LISA,

635
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:56,628
AND THEY EXIST
ONLY IN HIS DELUSIONS.

636
00:34:56,662 --> 00:35:02,301
- * YOU'LL ALWAYS
BE A PART OF ME *

637

* SO I'LL SLIP AWAY BETWEEN...*

640
00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:17,216
- GARY, REMEMBER
THE ANIMAL HOUSE PLAN.

641
00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:20,286
WE LOOKED ONLINE,
FOUND LISA'S OBITUARY

642
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:24,590
AND PRETENDED TO KNOW HER
IN ORDER TO SCOOP GIRLS.

643
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:27,393
YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW LISA.

644
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:30,229

OTHER PLANS TONIGHT,

645

SO IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE?

646
00:35:32,498 --> 00:35:36,235
Narrator: WITH THAT, GARY
PUT HIS NEWFOUND FEELINGS ASIDE,

647
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:39,205
FOR IT WAS AT LAST TIME
TO SEAL THE DEAL

648
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:41,473
AND SCOOP THE GIRLS.

649
00:35:41,507 --> 00:35:45,444

IN YOUR SHOES, I'D BE...

650
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,579

Narrator: SUFFICE IT TO SAY,

653
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:55,921
THE BUDDIES' INTERPRETATION
OF SCOOPING AND HOOKING UP

654
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:58,424
WAS, LIKE THEM, IDIOTIC.

655
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:05,664
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE JUST SCOOPED.

656
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:10,336

700
00:38:17,696 --> 00:38:21,667
WERE THE BIGGEST
PRODUCERS OF IT.

701
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,736
BUT CLOWN SHOOTS
HAD BEEN ILLEGAL

702
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:29,808
SINCE THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION.

703
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:33,912
COLLECTING TOYS FOR NEEDY KIDS
AND WINNING THE TROPHY

704
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:36,415
WOULD KEEP POLICE
OFF THEIR BACKS

705
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:39,685
AND AWAY FROM THEIR
ILLEGAL CLOWN ACTIVITIES.

706
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:45,691
- ALL WE NEED...
IS OUR LITTLE ELVES...

707
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:48,460
TO MAKE US MORE TOYS.

708
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:52,531
MMM MMM MMM.

709
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:55,033
Narrator:
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN,

710
00:38:55,066 --> 00:39:00,038
THE BOYS SETTLED IN
AFTER ANOTHER PRODUCTIVE DAY.

711
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,773
UNFORTUNATELY,

712
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:05,444
EYES WERE STILL UPON THEM.

713
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:08,623
- AND ON THE LOCAL FRONT,
WE'RE JUST DAYS AWAY

714
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:11,016
FROM THE ANNUAL
SPRINGLE BELL TOY RUN.

715
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:13,952
RIVAL BIKERS ARE POURING IN
WITH THE HOPES OF WINNING

716
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:16,388
THE PRESTIGIOUS
SPRINGLE BELL TROPHY.

717
00:39:16,422 --> 00:39:20,025
IN OTHER NEWS, TWO OTHER
CHILDREN HAVE GONE MISSING.

718
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:22,961
- I JUST...
I JUST WISH LISA WAS HERE

719
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:25,497
TO SEE US GET BIG CHICKEN.

720
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:27,065
- OH, SHE SEES IT, GARY.

721
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:30,135
SHE SEES IT.

722
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:32,003
I-I TOO WISH I COULD SHARE
WHAT WE WERE DOING.

723
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:34,973
MY FATHER AND BROTHER
LIVE BUT 15 MINUTES FROM HERE.

724
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:37,476
- THEY MUST BE PROUD OF YOU.

725
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:38,777
- OH, OF COURSE.

726
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:41,379
ALL THEY DO IS BRAG.

727
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:48,420
MY FATHER WOULD BE MORE
PROUD THOUGH, IF I, UH,

728
00:39:48,454 --> 00:39:50,055
IF I WERE PRACTICING MEDICINE.

729
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:52,958
- YOU COULD.
YOU'RE A MEDICAL GENIUS.

730
00:39:56,595 --> 00:39:59,598
GRAHAM REALLY
LOOKS UP TO YOU, YOU KNOW.

731
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:01,967
- KRAVELLO.

732
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,670
THAT WAS THE GUY
TO INTERN UNDER.

733
00:40:04,703 --> 00:40:06,738
- YOUR OLD MENTOR.

734
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:07,973
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM, GARY?

735
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:10,976
IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING.

736
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:17,215
Narrator: MICHELANGELO...
DA VINCI...

737
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,985
KRAVELLO.

738
00:40:20,018 --> 00:40:22,821
KENNY KRAVELLO
WAS A MASTER TROPHY MAKER

739
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:25,491
WHOSE RADICAL CONCEPTS
WOULD PERMANENTLY ALTER

740
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:29,728
THE LANDSCAPE
OF TROPHY CONSTRUCTION.

741
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:32,731
THE GREATEST ROOKIE IN
THE HISTORY OF MR. TROPHY,

742
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:37,235
KRAVELLO DISPLAYED TROPHY MAKING
SKILLS NEVER BEFORE SEEN,

743
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,038
TILL YEARS LATER,
WHEN GARY ARRIVED.

744
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:41,907
IN NO TIME, THE TWO BECAME

745
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,042
THE FINEST ROOKIE-MENTOR
PARTNERSHIP

746
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:46,244
IN THE TROPHY BUSINESS.

747
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,213
IT ALL APPEARED PERFECT

748
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:51,249
TILL THE MR. TROPHY
COMPANY CHRISTMAS PARTY.

749
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,752
THE MORNING BEGAN
LIKE ALL THE OTHERS.

750
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,954

751
00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:57,889

WERE GETTING READY
FOR THE NIGHT OF THEIR LIVES.

755
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:06,231
- WHOO! GOOD MORNING, LADIES.

756
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,601
FIRST, I'M GONNA
START OFF LIKE THIS.

757
00:41:09,635 --> 00:41:11,670
HEY, HELP ME SING IT, HOMEBOY.

- * WE CAN TAKE OUR TURN
SINGING THEM DIRTY RAP SONGS *

764
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:28,295
* STOP AND HIT THE BONG
LIKE CHEECH AND CHONG *

773
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:45,704
AND TROPHIES.

774
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:46,905

775
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:48,840
Narrator: UNTIL...

776
00:41:48,874 --> 00:41:50,876
- OH, YOU DID IT!

777
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:54,780
YOU DID IT.

778
00:41:59,084 --> 00:42:00,619
- KRAVELLO!

779
00:42:00,652 --> 00:42:02,020
MR. PRELL!

780
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:08,026
KRAVELLO!

Narrator: AND FROM THAT DAY ON,

782
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,297
LIFE AT MR. TROPHY
WAS NEVER THE SAME.

783
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:15,701
- WELL, MAYBE MR. TROPHY
CAN GET BACK ON TOP

784
00:42:15,734 --> 00:42:17,969
NOW THAT YOU HAVE GRAHAM.

785
00:42:18,003 --> 00:42:19,871
- WHY?

786
00:42:19,905 --> 00:42:23,609
SO I CAN END UP LIKE KRAVELLO?

787
00:42:23,642 --> 00:42:26,678
WHEN WE GET BACK, THAT KID'S
WORKING IN THE FRONT OFFICE.

788
00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:28,355
- BUT YOU'VE BEEN TRAINING HIM
LIKE YOU WANT A PARTNER.

789
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,015
- LOOK...

790
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:34,552
HE AIN'T MAKING TROPHIES
ALONGSIDE ME... PERIOD.

791
00:42:38,323 --> 00:42:41,192
NOW LET'S JUST
GET SOME SHUT-EYE.

792
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:45,864
TOMORROW'S A BIG DAY.

793
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:07,285
- MENTOR WANTS TO PUT YOU
IN THE FRONT OFFICE.

794
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:10,388
WELL, GRAHAM, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO PROVE TO HIM

795
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,390
THAT YOU CAN BE A TROPHY MAKER.

796
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,060
TWO CREAMS, NO SUGAR?

797
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:18,730
A REFRESHING BOXED FRUIT DRINK?

798
00:43:18,764 --> 00:43:22,367
MENTOR, I'VE BEEN THINKING
OF WAYS I CAN STEP UP MY GAME.

799
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,235
- FOR EXAMPLE,

800
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:25,379
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
CREATING AWARDS

801
00:43:25,403 --> 00:43:26,838
FOR PEOPLE WHO GIVE AWARDS?

802
00:43:26,872 --> 00:43:28,940
IT'S A...
IT'S AN UNTAPPED MARKET.

803
00:43:36,081 --> 00:43:38,083
WHERE'S THE PINTO?

804
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:39,384
- ALL OF OUR MONEY'S IN THERE.

805
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,395
- HEY, FELLAS,
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

806
00:43:50,428 --> 00:43:51,438
- UH, NOTHING.
NO PROBLEM AT ALL.

807
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:55,867
- MY CARD.

808
00:43:55,901 --> 00:43:57,969

809
00:43:58,003 --> 00:43:59,905
- UH, VINNY. VINNY VAN GO.

810
00:43:59,938 --> 00:44:01,840
I DRIVE THE OSCO DRUG
SAMARITAN VAN.

811
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:04,342
WE'RE A PROMOTIONAL/COURTESY VAN

812
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:05,777
"COURTESY" AS IN FREE.

00:44:05,811 --> 00:44:07,746

00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:14,419
LOOK, I'VE BEEN TRACKING YOU
AND I KNOW EVERYTHING,

THAT'S RIGHT.

817
00:44:20,826 --> 00:44:23,261
NOW, IF YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU,

818
00:44:23,294 --> 00:44:25,139
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE A RIDE
WITH YOUR NEW BEST BUDDY,

819
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,432
VINNY VAN GO.

IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU.

821
00:44:29,267 --> 00:44:33,304
SO DO YOU GUYS MYSPACE?

822
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:34,706
I HAVE A MYSPACE ACCOUNT,

823
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:37,042
BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS.

824
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:47,152
OH, GREGORY?

825
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:48,453

826
00:44:48,486 --> 00:44:52,357
REFRESHING
BOXED FRUIT DRINKS, PLEASE?

827
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:56,928
I SAID GIVE ME A
REFRESHING BOXED FRUIT DRINK!

00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:00,265
THANKS.

829
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:02,167
OOH, OH, GUYS!

830
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,510
WE SHOULD PRETEND
TO BE THE A-TEAM.

831
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,303
OH, YEAH. YEAH.

832
00:45:05,336 --> 00:45:06,938
I GET TO BE HANNIBAL. CALLED IT!

833
00:45:06,972 --> 00:45:09,507
NO, NO, WAIT.
I'M DRIVING THE VAN.

834
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,209

00:45:11,242 --> 00:45:12,744
BECAUSE I PITY THE FOOL!

836
00:45:12,778 --> 00:45:15,480
OH, YEAH, I PITY THE FOOL!

837
00:45:15,513 --> 00:45:19,317
- WE'VE BEEN TAKEN CAPTIVE
BY AN ENERGY VAMPIRE.

838
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,319
- YOU GENIUSES
AND YOUR IMAGINATIONS.

839
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:23,822
VAMPIRES ARE MAKE-BELIEVE.

840
00:45:23,855 --> 00:45:25,099
- VAMPIRES ARE
FICTIONAL CHARACTERS

841
00:45:25,123 --> 00:45:27,325
BASED ON REAL LIFE
"ENERGY VAMPIRES."

842
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:29,761
INSTEAD OF SUCKING BLOOD,
THEY SUCK ENERGY.

843
00:45:29,795 --> 00:45:34,032
- WELCOME TO THE OPENING NIGHT
OF MY NEW MUSICAL.

844
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:37,235
VINNY.

845
00:45:37,268 --> 00:45:39,004
- THE COFFIN-LIKE INTERIOR,

846
00:45:39,037 --> 00:45:41,539
OUR PULSE RATES FALLING
WITH EVERY FRIVOLOUS SUBJECT,

847
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,075
THE HEAVY SMELL
OF DRAKKAR NOIR...

848
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:48,379
- OKAY, WHO CAN HOLD A NOTE
THE LONGEST?

849
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:49,848
ME FIRST.

850
00:45:49,881 --> 00:45:55,553
LAAAAAA...

851
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:58,523
AHHH!

852
00:45:58,556 --> 00:46:01,026
AH, MAN!

853
00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:03,494
Narrator: VINNY HOPED
BUYING THE BUDDIES A PIZZA

854
00:46:03,528 --> 00:46:05,496
WOULD SOLIDIFY A FRIENDSHIP,

855
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:07,866
NOT THAT THEY HAD ANY CHOICE.

856
00:46:07,899 --> 00:46:09,868
- THIS MISSING KID JARED
HAS HIS PICTURE

857
00:46:09,901 --> 00:46:12,437
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

858
00:46:16,174 --> 00:46:19,777
GUYS, WE SHOULD TOTALLY
DRAW A HITLER MUSTACHE ON HIM.

859
00:46:26,918 --> 00:46:28,119
- THE BREAD...

860
00:46:28,153 --> 00:46:29,587
IT'S GARLIC BREAD.

861
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,991
THE GARLIC WILL REPEL HIS POWER
AND RESTORE OUR ENERGY.

862
00:46:33,024 --> 00:46:34,459
EAT.

863
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:41,032
- MORE CHERRY COLA,
YOU FILTHY WHORE!

864
00:46:41,066 --> 00:46:42,901
NOW, ABOUT ME.

865
00:46:42,934 --> 00:46:46,404
NOW, YOU CAN ALREADY TELL
I'M A GREAT LISTENER.

866
00:46:46,437 --> 00:46:50,075
THAT'S WHY MY NONIE BOUGHT ME
THE SAMARITAN VAN.

867
00:46:50,108 --> 00:46:53,344
- VINNY.

868
00:46:53,378 --> 00:46:56,081
YOU'RE CLOSE WITH
YOUR GRANDMOTHER THEN?

869
00:46:56,114 --> 00:46:59,317
- YEAH, I LIVE WITH HER.

870
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:01,486
- IF YOU ALLOW US TO PART WAYS

871
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:03,488
AND AGREE TO FORGET ALL OF THIS,

872
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:06,524
NO HARM WILL COME TO HER.

873
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,496
- YOU GUYS WOULD KILL
MY GRANDMOTHER?

874
00:47:11,529 --> 00:47:12,964

WHEN ARE WE GONNA KILL HER?
WHAT DO I WEAR?

879
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:25,944
OH, WAIT.

880
00:47:25,977 --> 00:47:28,313
I WANT YOU GUYS TO KNOW

881
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:31,382
ISN'T GONNA GET IN THE WAY
OF OUR GETTING BIG CHICKEN.

882
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:34,319
YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO FIND
A WAY TO PAY FOR GAS.

883
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:38,056
- DIDN'T YOU SAY YOUR FAMILY
LIVES NEAR HERE?

884
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:43,094

MY FATHER FOR MONEY.

00:51:41,266 --> 00:51:42,767
WITH LIGHTER FLUID,

954
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,637
LEAVING HIM WITH SENSITIVITY
IN ONLY THREE FINGERS.

00:51:52,743 --> 00:51:55,313
GARTH! HOW LOVELY TO SEE YOU.

956
00:51:55,346 --> 00:51:57,182
AND WINTER.

957
00:51:57,215 --> 00:51:59,284
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

00:51:59,317 --> 00:52:02,187
- I NEED MONEY.

959
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:03,754
DADDY.

00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:05,456
LET ME MAKE THIS.

961
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:07,758
I MAKE IT ALL THE TIME
AT THE RECTORY.

962
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:11,162
PLEASE?

963
00:52:11,196 --> 00:52:13,398
- GARTH, WE NEED
TO MAKE THIS FAST.

964
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:15,900
AS PRESIDENT-ELECT
OF THE SPECIAL OLYMPICS,

965
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:19,370
YOU NEED TO MEET
WITH YOUR TRANSITION TEAM.

967
00:52:21,772 --> 00:52:26,244
SON OF A GUN MAKES TWICE WHAT
I DID WHEN I WAS PRACTICING.

968
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:29,347
- AND I
AM BETTER-LOOKING THAN YOU.

969
00:52:44,562 --> 00:52:47,498
- HOW'S THE TEA, DADDY?

970
00:52:47,532 --> 00:52:49,534
THE TEA?

971
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,975
- IT'S ACTUALLY PERFECT.

972
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:01,246
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
I RECEIVED A LETTER

973
00:53:01,279 --> 00:53:03,214
FROM ONE OF YOUR PRIESTS.

974
00:53:03,248 --> 00:53:04,815
YOU'VE BECOME QUITE
THE LITTLE HOMEMAKER

975
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:06,451
AROUND THE RECTORIES.

976
00:53:06,484 --> 00:53:07,785
- SERIOUSLY,

977
00:53:07,818 --> 00:53:09,330
HOW MANY HARVARD GRADUATES
WOULD GIVE UP

978
00:53:09,354 --> 00:53:11,856
A CAREER IN MEDICINE
TO WORK WITH THE CHURCH?

979
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:13,424
HA, HA, HA.

980
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:14,592
HA, HA, HA.

981
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:16,227
HA, HA, HA.

982
00:53:17,595 --> 00:53:19,664
OH, I THINK
YOU MISUNDERSTOOD ME, GARY.

983
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:22,600
IT WAS MY BROTHER GARTH
THAT WENT TO HARVARD.

984
00:53:22,633 --> 00:53:24,335

WHAT DO YOU DO FOR WORK?

990
00:53:37,515 --> 00:53:39,817
- WELL...
- GARY IS AN ENGINEER.

991
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:44,355
HE WORKS WITH COLORFUL RESINS
AND PLASTICS.

992
00:53:44,389 --> 00:53:46,891
UH, HE RECENTLY LOST
HIS GIRLFRIEND, LISA.

993
00:53:46,924 --> 00:53:49,960
I'M PROVIDING SPIRITUAL COUNSEL.

994
00:53:49,994 --> 00:53:52,263
IF ANYTHING GOOD
HAS COME OUT OF THE LOSS,

995
00:53:52,297 --> 00:53:54,532
IT'S THAT THE TWO OF US
ARE ACTUALLY NOW DATING

996
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:56,934
KATELYN AND BRITTANY...
LISA'S OLD ROOMMATES.

997
00:53:56,967 --> 00:54:01,005
- GREGORY, YOU'RE DATING?

998
00:54:01,038 --> 00:54:03,007
- IT'S VERY EXCITING.

999
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,610
- A GIRL?
- YEAH!

1000
00:54:05,643 --> 00:54:09,880
- YOU'VE HAD INTERCOURSE
WITH HER?

1001
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:11,649
- WHY, WE WERE ON OUR WAY

1002
00:54:11,682 --> 00:54:13,351
TO HAVE INTERCOURSE
WITH THE TWO OF THEM

1003
00:54:13,384 --> 00:54:16,754
WHEN GARY'S CAR WAS STOLEN.

1004
00:54:16,787 --> 00:54:19,657
DADDY.

1005
00:54:21,892 --> 00:54:24,028
I KNOW I'VE BEEN
A CONSTANT SOURCE OF GRIEF

1006
00:54:24,061 --> 00:54:26,931
FOR THIS FAMILY, BUT...

1007
00:54:28,566 --> 00:54:31,836
I'VE GROWN.

1008
00:54:33,971 --> 00:54:36,641
- SON.

1009
00:54:40,378 --> 00:54:43,981
MOTHER AND I HAD YOU
SO LATE IN LIFE.

1010
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:47,017
YOU WERE...

1011
00:54:47,051 --> 00:54:49,354
AN ACCIDENT.

1012
00:54:49,387 --> 00:54:51,489
BUT WITH...

1013
00:54:51,522 --> 00:54:55,960
WITH YOUR CLEANING,

1014
00:54:55,993 --> 00:55:01,065
I-I GUESS YOU'VE FINALLY FOUND

1015
00:55:01,098 --> 00:55:03,701
A WAY TO FIT IN.

1016
00:55:07,872 --> 00:55:10,341

00:55:16,447 --> 00:55:17,715
GUILTY.

IT'S JUST A LITTLE DITTY

1021
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:21,118

1022
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:24,789

LET ME GET THE MONEY.

1034
00:56:19,477 --> 00:56:21,178
- I DO MORE THAN CLEANING,
GARTH.

1035
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,914
I DO THE LORD'S WORK.

1036
00:56:23,948 --> 00:56:26,584
YOU ARE A SOCIOPATH.

1037
00:56:28,486 --> 00:56:30,988
YOUR ACTIONS ARE DICTATED
BY A PSYCHOTIC NEED

1038
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:33,958
FOR ATTENTION AND ADULATION.

1039
00:56:33,991 --> 00:56:37,728
YOU ARE INCAPABLE
OF FORMING BONDS WITH OTHERS.

1040
00:56:37,762 --> 00:56:39,930
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT
YOU AND ONE HOUR PHOTO HERE

1041
00:56:39,964 --> 00:56:41,766
ARE REALLY UP TO.

1042
00:56:41,799 --> 00:56:43,768
- GARY IS MY FRIEND.

1043
00:56:43,801 --> 00:56:46,203
- YOU HAVE NO FRIENDS,
ONLY VICTIMS,

1044
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:51,609
AND ACCOMPLICES WHO END UP
AS VICTIMS.

1045
00:57:04,555 --> 00:57:06,457
- OH. THAT'S OKAY.

1046
00:57:08,225 --> 00:57:10,695
OH. OW!

00:57:10,728 --> 00:57:11,962
OW.

1048
00:57:11,996 --> 00:57:12,997
ALL RIGHT.

1049
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,632
AAH!

1050
00:57:14,665 --> 00:57:15,809
NO, YOU... I GOT IT.
LET ME JUST GET YOUR HANDS OFF.

1051
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:18,969
GET... I GOT IT. LEAVE IT ALONE.

1052
00:57:20,505 --> 00:57:21,939
SHIT.

1053
00:57:21,972 --> 00:57:24,108
GOD...

1054
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:29,647
OH. OKAY, FINE. DO IT YOURSELF.

1055
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,848
THAT WAS MY FOOT!

1056
00:57:37,588 --> 00:57:39,657
- MENTOR, I KNOW YOU
MAY HAVE ALTERNATIVE PLANS

1057
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:41,859
FOR MY INTERNSHIP, BUT IF
I COULD JUST HAVE A SECOND...

1058
00:57:41,892 --> 00:57:42,860
- NOT NOW, ROOK.

1059
00:57:42,893 --> 00:57:47,131
THIS IS WHY I WORK ALONE.

1060
00:57:47,164 --> 00:57:50,100
- WELL, THAT WAS
A PLEASANT VISIT.

1061
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:51,769
SORRY FOR THE DELAY.

1062
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:55,239
I JUST HAD TO SLIP INTO
SOMETHING MORE COMFORTABLE.

1063
00:57:55,272 --> 00:57:57,241
- I JUST GOT WORD
ON THE TWO-WAY.

1064
00:57:57,274 --> 00:57:59,510
BIG CHICKEN AND THE WHITE DEVILS
ARE HOLING UP

1065
00:57:59,544 --> 00:58:00,678
AT SANTA'S PLANTATION.

1066
00:58:00,711 --> 00:58:02,146
- THE OLD ABANDONED THEME PARK

1067
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:03,814
JUST OUTSIDE LACONIA.

1068
00:58:03,848 --> 00:58:06,751
WHY, WE COULD TAKE OUT
BIG CHICKEN

1069
00:58:06,784 --> 00:58:10,054
BEFORE HE EVEN GETS
TO THE SPRINGLE BELL TOY RUN.

1070
00:58:10,087 --> 00:58:14,158
NOT BAD, ENERGY VAMPIRE.

1071
00:58:14,191 --> 00:58:16,126
- ENERGY WHAT?

1072
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,729
AND I THOUGHT I WAS WEIRD.

1073
00:58:18,763 --> 00:58:21,832
- JUST TAKE US
TO SANTA'S PLANTATION.

1074
00:58:26,203 --> 00:58:27,872
WELL, TODAY RINGS ANEW.

1075
00:58:27,905 --> 00:58:31,008
WE GET TO RID THE EARTH
OF A MOTORCYCLE OUTLAW HEATHEN

1076
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:32,910
AND FULFILL OUR QUOTA.

1077
00:58:32,943 --> 00:58:34,745
HEY, GAR?

1078
00:58:34,779 --> 00:58:38,716
- OUR QUOTA?
FROM HERE ON IN, IT'S MY QUOTA.

1079
00:58:38,749 --> 00:58:42,319
- * GOING DOWN TO WHISPERVILLE *

1080
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:45,155
* WHERE THE LIVING
LOVE SONGS GROW *

1081
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:48,292
* THEY BEAT THEIR WINGS
AND WHISPER THINGS *

1082
00:58:48,325 --> 00:58:49,794
* MAN WAS NOT MEANT TO KNOW *

1083
00:58:49,827 --> 00:58:51,095
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

1084
00:58:51,128 --> 00:58:52,830
ONCE WE GET
TO SANTA'S PLANTATION

1085
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:54,240
AND TAKE OUT BIG CHICKEN,
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO STAY

1086
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:55,909
AND HAVE THE BEST TIME
OF OUR LIVES, ALL RIGHT?

1087
00:58:55,933 --> 00:58:58,068
WE'RE GONNA DO THE SNOW GLOBE
EATING CONTEST,

1088
00:58:58,102 --> 00:58:59,804
WE'RE GONNA MAKE CANDY CANES,

1089
00:58:59,837 --> 00:59:01,214
AND I WANT TO REENACT
THE NATIVITY SCENE, ALL RIGHT?

1090
00:59:01,238 --> 00:59:03,340
BECAUSE LAST YEAR,
I MESSED UP REALLY BAD.

1091
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,909
YEAH, I PISSED OFF
ONE OF THE WISE MEN

1092
00:59:04,942 --> 00:59:06,744
AND I ATE THE BABY JESUS, OKAY?

1093
00:59:06,777 --> 00:59:09,747
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY!

1094
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:10,915
AAH!

1095
00:59:10,948 --> 00:59:13,684
I ALMOST RAN OVER A KID.

1096
00:59:13,718 --> 00:59:15,119
WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME,
RIGHT?

1097
00:59:16,821 --> 00:59:20,024
I GOTTA STOP KILLING PEOPLE.

1098
00:59:21,258 --> 00:59:22,727
FRESH CHERRIES?

1099
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,762
I'M PULLING OVER.

1100
00:59:28,032 --> 00:59:30,167
Narrator: EVEN THOUGH
THEIR DATE WITH BIG CHICKEN

1101
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,003
WAS MINUTES AWAY,
VINNY COULDN'T HELP HIMSELF.

1102
00:59:33,037 --> 00:59:36,573
HE'D NEVER HAD SPRING CHERRIES.

1103
00:59:41,378 --> 00:59:44,114
- GARY, PLEASE TALK TO ME.

1104
00:59:44,148 --> 00:59:45,783
WE'RE FRIENDS.

1105
00:59:45,816 --> 00:59:47,317
- OH, REALLY?

1106
00:59:47,351 --> 00:59:49,386
BECAUSE THE COMPUTER
ON YOUR BROTHER'S WHEELCHAIR

1107
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,221
SAID WE'RE ACCOMPLICES.

1108
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:53,390
AND COMPUTERS DON'T LIE.
- OH, NO, NO.

1109
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,035
ALL OF THAT WAS BASED
ON PSYCHOLOGICAL EXAMS

1110
00:59:55,059 --> 00:59:57,027
THAT WERE DONE YEARS AGO.

1111
00:59:57,061 --> 00:59:59,329
A YEAR AGO.

1112
00:59:59,363 --> 01:00:03,067
OH, GARY.
I THINK THAT MAY BE JARED.

1113
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,202
THE BOY THAT KATELYN
AND BRITTANY WERE SEEKING.

1114
01:00:05,235 --> 01:00:06,236
SEE?

1115
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:07,805
- OH, NO.

1116
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:09,774
JARED HAS A HITLER MUSTACHE.

1117
01:00:09,807 --> 01:00:12,109
- NO, NO, NO. VINNY ADDED THAT.

1118
01:00:12,142 --> 01:00:15,179
I THINK IT'S HIM.

1119
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:18,182
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

1120
01:00:18,215 --> 01:00:19,817
DO YOU HAVE
ANY INFORMATION REGARDING

1121
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:21,418
THE OWNER OF THAT THERE TRUCK?

1122
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:25,422
AND WHO'S THE BOY WITH HIM
IN THE FRONT?

1123
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,024
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU ARE,

1124
01:00:27,057 --> 01:00:30,895
BUT PAUL-OF-THE-SHED
AIN'T THE FRIENDLY TYPE.

1125
01:00:30,928 --> 01:00:33,063
SURE DOES LOVE
HIS CHERRIES THOUGH.

1126
01:00:33,097 --> 01:00:35,399
- IS THAT SO?

1127
01:00:35,432 --> 01:00:37,868
THANK YOU, NEIGHBOR.

1128
01:00:41,238 --> 01:00:43,941
WE HAVE TO TAKE HIM OUT.

1129
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,076
- WOW, YOU SEE
THE SIZE OF THAT GUY?

1130
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:48,913
- HE IS UNUSUALLY LARGE.

1131
01:00:48,946 --> 01:00:52,216
BUT GARY, YOU HAVE
WHAT'S REFERRED TO

1132
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:56,854
IN MEDICAL TERMS
AS "SUPER RETARD STRENGTH."

1133
01:00:56,887 --> 01:00:58,155
- IT'S TRUE.

1134
01:00:58,188 --> 01:01:00,090
I GET AN ABNORMAL SURGE
OF ADRENALINE

1135
01:01:00,124 --> 01:01:01,458
WHENEVER I GET EMOTIONAL.

1136
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:05,395
- WELL, THEN. COVER ME.

1137
01:01:07,364 --> 01:01:09,867
MR. OF-THE-SHED,

1138
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:11,335
YOU'RE HEADED TO HELL, SIR,

1139
01:01:11,368 --> 01:01:12,937
BUT I CAN HELP YOU
GET TO HEAVEN.

1140
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:15,072
NOPE, I'M AFRAID
I CAN'T LET YOU GO,

1141
01:01:15,105 --> 01:01:16,140
FRIEND!

1142
01:01:17,474 --> 01:01:20,010
- HEY, KIDS. LET'S SING A SONG.

1143
01:01:20,044 --> 01:01:24,348
* TWINKLE, TWINKLE LITTLE STAR *

1144
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:26,059
narrator: WHETHER IT WAS
THE MISSING JARED OR NOT,

1145
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:28,285
PAUL-OF-THE-SHED FLED.

1146
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:31,889
- OKAY, GARY,
YOU GOT YOUR REVENGE ON ME.

1147
01:01:31,922 --> 01:01:35,192
BUT NOW WE NEED
TO GO AFTER THAT DEMON!

1148
01:01:35,225 --> 01:01:38,328
- WHY?

1149
01:01:38,362 --> 01:01:41,498
- GARY, THE MAN
MAY HAVE ABDUCTED A CHILD.

1150
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:44,401
- I WOULDN'T KILL SOMEONE
'CAUSE OF THAT.

1151
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:47,304
- THEN WHAT HAVE WE BEEN DOING?

1152
01:01:47,337 --> 01:01:50,207
THE SPRING BREAK OF OUR LIVES,
ANSWERING A CALLING

1153
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,876
TO PROFILE EVIL PEOPLE
AND KILL THEM

1154
01:01:51,909 --> 01:01:53,510
SO THEY GET SAFE PASSAGE
TO HEAVEN.

1155
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,379
COME ON.

1156
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:57,447
- OUR CALLING
IS TO PROFILE AND KILL

1157
01:01:57,481 --> 01:02:00,184
POTENTIAL TROPHY WINNERS.

1158
01:02:01,485 --> 01:02:04,321
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

1159
01:02:04,354 --> 01:02:06,090
YOU'RE SAYING YOU WANT
TO KILL PEOPLE

1160
01:02:06,123 --> 01:02:07,500
BASED ON THE FACT
THAT THEY MIGHT PRECIPITATE

1161
01:02:07,524 --> 01:02:10,861
INCREASED TROPHY SALES?

1162
01:02:10,895 --> 01:02:12,496
THEN WHY ON EARTH
ARE YOU PURSUING

1163
01:02:12,529 --> 01:02:14,932
A MURDEROUS CRETIN
LIKE BIG CHICKEN?

1164
01:02:14,965 --> 01:02:17,501
- 'CAUSE IF BIG CHICKEN WINS
THE SPRINGLE BELL TOY RUN,

1165
01:02:17,534 --> 01:02:21,405
OUTLAW BIKERS EVERYWHERE
WILL BE PURSUING TROPHIES.

1166
01:02:21,438 --> 01:02:23,440
Narrator: AND WHAT'S
WHEN GREGORY REALIZED

1167
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:26,811
THAT HE AND THE BUDDIES
HADN'T BEEN KILLING FOR GOD.

1168
01:02:26,844 --> 01:02:29,179
- OH, DEAR ME.

1169
01:02:29,213 --> 01:02:31,949
Narrator: THEY'D BEEN KILLING
TO CURB TROPHY SALES.

1170
01:02:31,982 --> 01:02:34,785
- ALL THIS TIME,

1171
01:02:34,819 --> 01:02:37,487
ALL THOSE INNOCENT...

1172
01:02:37,521 --> 01:02:40,190
THE WORLD
OF THE TROPHY MAKER, HUH?

1173
01:02:40,224 --> 01:02:42,526
THE POWER OF THE TROPHY.

1174
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:47,431
YOU SCREW TOGETHER
PIECES OF FUCKING PLASTIC!

1175
01:02:47,464 --> 01:02:49,834
- LISA DIDN'T THINK SO.

1176
01:02:49,867 --> 01:02:53,537
- OH, YOU NEVER EVEN MET LISA,
YOU DELUSIONAL TWIT!

1177
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:57,875
- WHAT ABOUT YOU,
MR. COMMUNITY COLLEGE?

1178
01:02:57,908 --> 01:03:03,280
YOU'RE ONE OF THEM PSYCHO,
BORN-AGAIN, HOLY ROLLERS...

1179
01:03:03,313 --> 01:03:07,784
WHOSE FAMILY HATES HIM.

1180
01:03:11,388 --> 01:03:14,024
- I KNOW ABOUT YOUR PLAN
TO PUT ME AWAY

1181
01:03:14,058 --> 01:03:15,325
IN THE FRONT OFFICE.

1182
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:17,361
- WELL, SINCE WE'RE ALL
BEING SO OPEN...

1183
01:03:19,496 --> 01:03:23,000
I STOLE YOUR CAR

1184
01:03:23,033 --> 01:03:26,436
SO YOU'D ALL BE FORCED
TO BE MY FRIENDS.

1185
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:29,406
- WELL, THAT WAS STUPID.

1186
01:03:31,075 --> 01:03:37,047
I FOR ONE, AM INCAPABLE
OF BEING FRIENDS...

1187
01:03:37,081 --> 01:03:39,516
WITH ANYONE.

1188
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:43,587
ESPECIALLY NOT WITH SOME LOWLY,

1189
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:47,858
SMALL-MINDED, WAREHOUSE GRUNT,

1190
01:03:47,892 --> 01:03:50,895
TROPHY MAKER.

1191
01:04:08,212 --> 01:04:11,015
OH, YEAH?

WELL, I HATE REFRESHING
BOXED FRUIT DRINKS!

01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:11,341
THAT'S ONE I NEVER WON, PAL.

WHY'D YOU HAVE TO GO? *

1218
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:38,602

1219
01:05:38,635 --> 01:05:41,705

1220
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:14,738

1221
01:06:14,771 --> 01:06:18,008
WHERE THE HELL'S MY BELT?
I TOLD YOU I NEEDED A BELT.

1222
01:06:29,253 --> 01:06:31,221

1223
01:06:31,255 --> 01:06:33,490
MARIA.

ROOKIE.

Narrator: IT WAS COCKTAIL HOUR
AT THE VON GEARHARTS.

1226
01:07:02,386 --> 01:07:04,688
- HEY!

1227
01:07:04,721 --> 01:07:10,427

WHEN GREGORY DIDN'T BELONG.

1228
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:14,398

1233
01:08:02,212 --> 01:08:07,184

1238
01:08:27,204 --> 01:08:28,505
HELLO, CHIEF.

1239
01:08:29,673 --> 01:08:32,442
- MARIA.

1240
01:08:32,476 --> 01:08:33,516
CHIEF, I NEED TO SEE GARY.

1241
01:08:33,543 --> 01:08:34,811
- HE'S NOT HERE.

1242
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:40,584
YOU CAN LEAVE A NOTE
ON HIS DESK.

1243
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:43,920
- "MENTOR."

1244
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:46,923
"MENTOR,
I'M TAKING OUT BIG CHICKEN,

1245
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,492
"NOT TO CURB
THE TROPHY POPULATION,

narrator: THE OLD ABANDONED
SANTA'S PLANTATION...

1249
01:08:56,933 --> 01:09:00,904
TOP SECRET HIDEOUT
TO THE DREADED WHITE DEVILS.

1250
01:09:08,812 --> 01:09:10,347
- GARY TAGLER HERE,

1251
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:11,657
ONCE AGAIN,
IF YOU'RE JUST TUNING IN,

1252
01:09:11,681 --> 01:09:13,683
TWO MORE CHILDREN
HAVE BEEN ABDUCTED,

1253
01:09:13,717 --> 01:09:15,385
BRINGING THE NUMBER
OF MISSING CHILDREN

1254
01:09:15,419 --> 01:09:17,387
IN THE AREA TO THE HUNDREDS.

1255

POLICE ARE ASKING FOR YOUR HELP.
IF YOU HAVE ANY...

1256
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:26,230
Narrator: OH, THE WHITE DEVILS
WERE THIRSTY ALL RIGHT,

1257
01:09:26,263 --> 01:09:28,332
BUT FOR A LOT MORE THAN BEER.

1258
01:09:30,867 --> 01:09:32,569
Narrator: ALAS,
GRAHAM HAD FOUND HIMSELF

1259
01:09:32,602 --> 01:09:35,872
CAUGHT IN NONE OTHER
THAN BIG CHICKEN'S TALONS.

1260
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:41,511
OUTSIDE, GARY TRIED TO SUMMON
HIS SUPER RETARD STRENGTH,

1261
01:09:41,545 --> 01:09:43,913
AND FOR SOME REASON...

1262
01:09:43,947 --> 01:09:44,947
HE COULDN'T.

1263
01:10:01,598 --> 01:10:04,268
YEAH, IT'S GARY.

1264
01:10:04,301 --> 01:10:07,537
I NEED REINFORCEMENTS.

1265
01:10:07,571 --> 01:10:09,373
YEAH.

1266
01:10:13,477 --> 01:10:16,380
- GARY, WAIT!

1267
01:10:18,615 --> 01:10:20,717
I'M SORRY I LIED.

1268
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:24,754
AND I KNOW WHAT MY BROTHER
SAID WAS RIGHT.

1269
01:10:24,788 --> 01:10:27,557
MY MOTIVATIONS
HAVE BEEN SOLELY BASED

1270
01:10:27,591 --> 01:10:29,459
ON MY NEED FOR ADULATION.

1271
01:10:29,493 --> 01:10:32,762
BUT I'M SORRY FOR WHAT
I SAID ABOUT YOUR CAREER,

1272
01:10:34,464 --> 01:10:36,900
AND ESPECIALLY SORRY
FOR WHAT I SAID ABOUT LISA.

1273
01:10:36,933 --> 01:10:39,336
YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH HER,

1274
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:43,340
WHETHER IN YOUR MIND OR REALITY,

1275
01:10:43,373 --> 01:10:47,544
IS YOURS TO BE RESPECTED.

1276
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:50,614
- AND I'M SORRY I SAID
I HATE BOXED FRUIT DRINKS.

1277
01:10:50,647 --> 01:10:52,949
I MEAN, I DID NOT
LIKE THEM AT FIRST,

1278
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:56,420
BUT NOW I FIND THEM REFRESHING.

1279
01:10:56,453 --> 01:10:59,022
AND HEY, IF YOU'RE HERE,

1280
01:10:59,055 --> 01:11:02,492
MAYBE WHAT YOUR BROTHER
SAID WAS WRONG.

1281
01:11:02,526 --> 01:11:07,464
I MEAN, SOME GUYS
IN WHEELCHAIRS ARE STUPID.

1282
01:11:08,965 --> 01:11:11,501
- IT ISN'T THE TROPHY
THAT MAKES THE MAN.

1283
01:11:11,535 --> 01:11:15,372
IT ISN'T EVEN THE MAN
WHO MAKES THE TROPHY.

1284
01:11:15,405 --> 01:11:19,476
IT'S THE MAN WHO MADE
THE TROPHY.

1285
01:11:21,044 --> 01:11:24,080
- A MAN DOESN'T PUT
HIS TROPHY INTERN IN DANGER.

1286
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:27,584
- NO.

1287
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:30,820
HE SAVES HIM.

1288
01:11:30,854 --> 01:11:32,956
SO YOU GET IN THERE

1289
01:11:32,989 --> 01:11:37,594
AND YOU GO AND GET
THOSE TROPHY-MONGER BASTARDS.

1290
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:39,429
- THAT'S JUST IT.

1291
01:11:39,463 --> 01:11:42,031
MY SUPER RETARD STRENGTH
IS GONE.

1292
01:11:42,065 --> 01:11:43,833
- OH.

1293
01:11:43,867 --> 01:11:48,438
I CAN'T SEEM TO BRING MYSELF
TO POISON THEM EITHER.

1294
01:11:48,472 --> 01:11:50,940
MY GOODNESS, GARY.

1295
01:11:50,974 --> 01:11:56,312
HAVE WE BECOME HUMAN?

1296
01:12:00,617 --> 01:12:03,687
- IT COULDN'T HAVE COME
AT A WORSE TIME.

1297
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,121
- FELLAS!

1298
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:06,590
THEY'RE GONNA KILL GRAHAM!

1299
01:12:06,623 --> 01:12:08,592
- WE KNOW.
- YEAH.

1300
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:10,427
- WAIT. HOW DO YOU KNOW?

1301
01:12:12,796 --> 01:12:15,399
YOU KNOW BIG CHICKEN'S
REPUTATION.

1302
01:12:15,432 --> 01:12:17,701
GRAHAM HAD ME DRIVE HIM HERE,
AND I DID.

1303
01:12:17,734 --> 01:12:19,403
I DROPPED HIM OFF AND I LEFT.

1304
01:12:19,436 --> 01:12:23,006
THEN I REALIZED
WE'RE SERIAL BUDDIES,

1305
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:24,874
AND WE NEED TO STICK TOGETHER.

1306
01:12:24,908 --> 01:12:27,511
AND I HAVE A PLAN
TO FIX EVERYTHING

1307
01:12:27,544 --> 01:12:30,547
IF YOU'LL JUST TRUST ME.

1308
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:33,717
Narrator: VINNY'S PLAN WAS
TO INFILTRATE THE WHITE DEVILS

1309
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:35,752
BY POSING AS FELLOW BIKERS.

1310
01:12:35,785 --> 01:12:38,855
UNFORTUNATELY, VINNY DIDN'T
HAVE ANY BIKER CLOTHES,

1311
01:12:38,888 --> 01:12:42,826
BUT HE DID HAVE
A VAN FULL OF S&M GEAR.

1312
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:45,462
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW THIS STUFF EVEN GOT HERE.

1313
01:12:45,495 --> 01:12:46,906
- ALL RIGHT,
ENOUGH DAYDREAMING, YOU GUYS.

1314
01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:49,533
WE GOTTA SAVE ROOK.

1315
01:12:49,566 --> 01:12:52,135
GIVE ME THIS.

1316
01:12:55,138 --> 01:12:56,906
- OH, YES.

1317
01:13:36,112 --> 01:13:39,783
Both: SHH!

1318
01:14:10,847 --> 01:14:14,117
- I'M GONNA ASK YOU
FOR THE LAST TIME.

1319
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:17,487
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

1320
01:14:17,521 --> 01:14:19,789
- OH!

1321
01:14:19,823 --> 01:14:21,525
WHO ARE THESE CLOWNS?

1322
01:14:24,794 --> 01:14:28,031
Narrator: UNFORTUNATELY,
BIG CHICKEN DIDN'T APPRECIATE

1323
01:14:28,064 --> 01:14:30,166
HIS CLOWN SHOOT
BEING INTERRUPTED.

1324
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:34,538
- SO THIS...
THIS MUST BE YOUR FRIENDS, HUH?

1325
01:14:34,571 --> 01:14:38,041
- ACTUALLY, WE'RE BROTHERS
IN A RIVAL MOTORCYCLE GANG.

1326
01:14:38,074 --> 01:14:39,876
TELL THEM, GARY.

1327
01:14:39,909 --> 01:14:42,912
- MY INTERN WAS MERELY TRYING
TO MAKE A NAME FOR HIMSELF.

1328
01:14:42,946 --> 01:14:45,549
- AND SO WE'RE HOPING
THAT YOU'LL FORGIVE

1329
01:14:45,582 --> 01:14:46,950
THE WAY JESUS FORGAVE

1330
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:49,118
THE OUTLAW DONKEY GANGS
OF HIS TIME.

1331
01:14:49,152 --> 01:14:51,655
- WHOEVER YOU ARE,

1332
01:14:51,688 --> 01:14:54,824
I DON'T WANT ANY PROBLEMS, OKAY?

1333
01:14:54,858 --> 01:14:56,726
SO TAKE YOUR "INTERN"

1334
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:59,563
AND JUST BE GRATEFUL

1335
01:14:59,596 --> 01:15:01,965
YOU DIDN'T CATCH UP WITH ME
20 YEARS AGO.

1336
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:05,268
- THANK YOU.

1337
01:15:05,301 --> 01:15:07,737
- OH.

1338
01:15:07,771 --> 01:15:11,975
PAUL-OF-THE-SHED.
DIRECTOR ON THE SET.

1339
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:13,643
- WHAT'S THIS?

1340
01:15:13,677 --> 01:15:15,287
- OH, THESE ARE SOME FRUITS.
THEY WERE JUST LEAVING.

1341
01:15:15,311 --> 01:15:17,947
- BULLSHIT!
THESE WERE THE ASSHOLES

1342
01:15:17,981 --> 01:15:21,785
FROM THE CHERRY STAND.

1343
01:15:21,818 --> 01:15:23,787
- THEY'RE TROPHY MAKERS,
BIG CHICKEN!

1344
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:25,598
THEY CAME HERE TO TRY
AND STOP YOU FROM GETTING

1345
01:15:25,622 --> 01:15:27,791
YOUR BIG TROPHY
AT THE SPRINGLE BELL TOY RUN.

1346
01:15:27,824 --> 01:15:29,993
- I KNEW WE COULDN'T TRUST YOU.

1347
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:31,637
Narrator: GETTING IN THE WAY
OF BIG CHICKEN

1348
01:15:31,661 --> 01:15:33,238
WINNING THAT TROPHY
WAS JUST A DEATH SENTENCE

1349
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:36,566
WAITING TO BE CARRIED OUT.

1350
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,635
- I'D LOVE TO SEE THE LOOK
ON YOU BOYS' FACE

1351
01:15:38,668 --> 01:15:41,304
WHEN PAUL-OF-THE-SHED'S
KILLING YOU.

1352
01:15:41,337 --> 01:15:43,239
OH, WAIT. I WILL.

1353
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:46,676
HE'S FILMING IT.

1354
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:50,614
Narrator: PAUL-OF-THE-SHED
WAS A GIANT CLOWN DIRECTOR.

1355
01:15:50,647 --> 01:15:52,849
WELL, HE WAS 8 FEET TALL.

1356
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:55,585
PAUL ALSO SHOT CLOWN SNUFF.

1357
01:15:55,619 --> 01:15:57,120
HEY, THAT'S
WHEN YOU MURDER SOMEONE

1358
01:15:57,153 --> 01:15:58,888
IN REAL LIFE AND YOU FILM IT!

1359
01:15:58,922 --> 01:16:03,693
ALL PAUL NEEDED NOW
WAS HIS NEW CLOWNS.

1360
01:16:03,727 --> 01:16:06,696
- WON'T BE LONG NOW,
SERIAL BUDDIES.

1361
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:14,170
THAT'S A LARGE.
NO SAUCE AND COLD SARDINES.

1362
01:16:14,203 --> 01:16:18,207
- WHERE ARE MY REINFORCEMENTS?

1363
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:21,077
- I'M SORRY I GOT YOU GUYS
INTO THIS.

1364
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:23,046
- OH, NO, GRAHAM.

1365
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:24,848
THIS IS THE LORD'S DOING.

1366
01:16:24,881 --> 01:16:27,884
THE CATHOLIC WAY
OF "SIN NOW, SORRY LATER"

1367
01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:29,919
IS AS MUCH A MYTH
AS THE EASTER BUNNY

1368
01:16:29,953 --> 01:16:33,289
AND ENERGY VAMPIRES.

1369
01:16:38,061 --> 01:16:40,664
- I TOLD YOU
IT WOULDN'T BE LONG.

1370
01:16:40,697 --> 01:16:42,065
- WHAT?

1371
01:16:42,098 --> 01:16:43,266
WHAT?

1372
01:16:43,299 --> 01:16:45,101
- ALL RIGHT,
I AM AN ENERGY VAMPIRE.

1373
01:16:45,134 --> 01:16:47,136
HAPPY NOW?

1374
01:16:48,237 --> 01:16:50,373
- ARE THEY DEAD?
- COMATOSE.

1375
01:16:50,406 --> 01:16:52,175
NORMALLY, I WOULD'VE
TALKED 'EM TO DEATH,

1376
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:53,910
BUT I'VE CHANGED TOO.

1377
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:56,279
- WELL, LET'S BUST THIS JOINT.

1378
01:16:56,312 --> 01:16:58,648
- YEAH, WE'RE BUSTING A JOINT.

1379
01:16:58,682 --> 01:17:02,018
- A REAL LIFE ENERGY VAMPIRE.

1380
01:17:02,051 --> 01:17:04,387
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU PULLED IT OFF, VINNY.

1381
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:06,956
- FELLAS, WE'RE SERIAL BUDDIES.
WE CAN DO ANYTHING.

1382
01:17:06,990 --> 01:17:08,257
NOW LET'S GO DRIVE IN CIRCLES

1383
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:09,693
AND HAVE ME TALK
AT YOU NOT TO YOU.

1384
01:17:09,726 --> 01:17:10,960
- HEY.

1385
01:17:10,994 --> 01:17:15,732
WHY DON'T YOU JUST STOP
AND TALK AT ME,

1386
01:17:15,765 --> 01:17:17,701
ENERGY VAMPIRE.

1387
01:17:17,734 --> 01:17:20,103
- AAH!

1388
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:22,005
- GARY'S REINFORCEMENTS
FROM RON-A-ROLL

1389
01:17:22,038 --> 01:17:24,941
FINALLY ARRIVED.

1390
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:26,776
- YOU KNOW YOU'RE DEAD, RIGHT?

1391
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:29,412
- OH, ABSOLUTELY.

1392
01:17:29,445 --> 01:17:31,247
- YEAH, WE'RE DONE.

1393
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:34,383
- UH, CAN I GET A MINUTE?

1395
01:17:37,721 --> 01:17:40,924
- OH, NOT THAT. IT'S INHUMAN.

1396
01:17:40,957 --> 01:17:45,929
- WE'RE DEAD ANYWAYS.

1397
01:17:45,962 --> 01:17:51,968
- WE ARE DEAD. GOOD-BYE, VINNY.

1398
01:17:55,939 --> 01:17:59,275
NOW BITE DOWN.

1399
01:17:59,308 --> 01:18:02,345
IT WILL BE OVER SOON.

1400
01:18:02,378 --> 01:18:05,448
- OH, I'M BORED.

1401
01:18:05,481 --> 01:18:07,483
GET 'EM!

1402
01:18:10,219 --> 01:18:12,097
- * FLOATIN' DOWN THE RIVER
WITH A SATURATED LIVER *

1403
01:18:12,121 --> 01:18:13,866
* AND I WISH I COULD FORGIVE HER
BUT I DO BELIEVE SHE MEANT IT *

1404
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:14,967
* WHEN SHE TOLD ME
TO FORGET IT *

1405
01:18:14,991 --> 01:18:16,259
* AND I BET SHE WILL REGRET IT

1406
01:18:16,292 --> 01:18:17,302
* WHEN THEY FIND ME
IN THE MORNING *

1407
01:18:17,326 --> 01:18:18,895
* WET AND DROWNED

1408
01:18:18,928 --> 01:18:21,364

1409
01:18:21,397 --> 01:18:23,466
* GOIN' DOWN, GOIN' DOWN *

1410
01:18:23,499 --> 01:18:26,002
* GOIN' DOWN

1411
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:27,512
* COMING' UP FOR AIR
IT'S PRETTY STUFFY UNDER THERE *

1412
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:28,972
* I'D LIKE TO SAY
I DIDN'T CARE *

1413
01:18:29,005 --> 01:18:30,285

1414
01:18:32,108 --> 01:18:33,810
* I'M SOAKIN' WET

1415
01:18:33,843 --> 01:18:35,912
* AND I KNEW I SHOULD
HAVE TAKEN OFF MY SHOES *

1416
01:18:35,945 --> 01:18:36,945
* IT'S FRONT PAGE NEWS

1417
01:18:38,281 --> 01:18:43,219
* GOIN' DOWN, GOIN' DOWN *

1418
01:18:57,967 --> 01:18:59,268
* I WISH I HAD ANOTHER DRINK

1419
01:18:59,302 --> 01:19:00,770
* IT WOULDN'T BE
SO HARD TO SINK *

1420
01:19:00,804 --> 01:19:02,114
* I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN
TIME TO THINK *

1421
01:19:02,138 --> 01:19:03,415
* BESIDES I GOT
THE PICTURE STRAIGHT *

1422
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:04,941
* SHE MUST HAVE
HAD ANOTHER DATE *

1423
01:19:04,974 --> 01:19:06,442
* I DIDN'T NEED
THIS EXTRA WEIGHT *

1424
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:07,987
* I WISH THAT I COULD SEE
THE WAY TO SHORE *

1425
01:19:08,011 --> 01:19:10,113
* I DON'T WANT NO MORE

1426
01:19:10,146 --> 01:19:11,815
- I'M SO SOR...
WHAT'S THAT ON YOUR NOSE?

1427
01:19:11,848 --> 01:19:14,017
OH! I GOT IT!

1428
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:16,820
I GOT YOUR NOSE! I GOT IT.

1429
01:19:16,853 --> 01:19:18,121
I GOT IT.

1430
01:19:18,154 --> 01:19:19,198
Narrator: JUST WHEN IT LOOKED

1431
01:19:19,222 --> 01:19:23,192
LIKE ALL HOPE WAS LOST...

1432
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:32,035
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.

1433
01:19:32,068 --> 01:19:33,312
I WAS WATCHING RACHAEL RAY
THE OTHER DAY,

1434
01:19:33,336 --> 01:19:36,005
AND SHE MADE
THESE AMAZING SPINACH...

1435
01:19:36,039 --> 01:19:38,441
LIKE, ALMOST, LIKE,
SPINACH LASAGNA ROLLS.

1436
01:19:38,474 --> 01:19:40,476
THEY'RE SO GOOD. OH, MY GOD.

1437
01:19:40,509 --> 01:19:43,246
I'M HAVING A TEA PARTY LATER,
AND I WANT TO INVITE EVERYBODY.

1438
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:45,448
EVERYBODY HERE CAN COME
TO MY TEA PARTY.

1439
01:19:45,481 --> 01:19:48,852
I'M HAVING
SPANISH SPINACH LASAGNA ROLLS.

1440
01:19:48,885 --> 01:19:52,588
YEAH, SPANISH BECAUSE I'M ALSO
PUTTING JALAPENOS IN THERE.

1441
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:56,025
WHEN I WAS 13, I FINALLY
WAS LET OUT OF THE INCUBATOR.

1442
01:19:56,059 --> 01:19:57,269
I WAS IN AN INCUBATOR
FOR 13 YEARS,

1443
01:19:57,293 --> 01:19:58,261
AND IT ACTUALLY
WAS KIND OF NICE.

1444
01:19:58,294 --> 01:19:59,528
PEOPLE JUST CAME TO ME,

1445
01:19:59,562 --> 01:20:01,264
AND I GOT TO PLAY
WITH MY OWN STUFF.

1446
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:05,168
- PITY YOU CAN'T MIME
TAKING GARLIC SUPPLEMENTS.

1447
01:20:05,201 --> 01:20:07,112
- I HATED GYM CLASS, EXCEPT
WHEN IT WAS DODGE BALL DAY,

1448
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:09,105
'CAUSE THAT WAS THE ONLY DAY
WE GET TO HIT GIRLS.

1449
01:20:09,138 --> 01:20:10,940
AND MY BEST FRIEND ANTHONY
USED TO HAVE

1450
01:20:10,974 --> 01:20:13,052
A LITTLE SUPER SOAKER FOR ME,
AND WE WOULD PLAY ALL THE TIME.

1451
01:20:13,076 --> 01:20:14,086
AND HE'D INVITE ME OVER
TO HIS HOUSE

1452
01:20:14,110 --> 01:20:15,444
AND WE'D GO SWIMMING.

1453
01:20:15,478 --> 01:20:16,555
WELL, I'D GO TO HIS HOUSE
AND GO SWIMMING.

1454
01:20:16,579 --> 01:20:18,381
HE WASN'T THERE.

1455
01:20:18,414 --> 01:20:20,192
HE REALLY DIDN'T KNOW
I WENT SWIMMING AT HIS HOUSE.

1456
01:20:20,216 --> 01:20:24,287
- HE'S GONE FULL ENERGY VAMPIRE.

1457
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,289
- I GOT TO GO AFTER BIG CHICKEN.

1458
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:28,958
YOU GOT THE BALL, ROOK.

1459
01:20:28,992 --> 01:20:30,526
- OH, MAN.
HIGH SCHOOL WAS THE BEST.

1460
01:20:30,559 --> 01:20:32,371
THERE WAS THIS ONE DAY THAT
I FORGOT MY LUNCH AT HOME.

1461
01:20:32,395 --> 01:20:34,864
LUCKILY, MY BIOLOGY TEACHER
WAS LIKE, "HEY, GUYS.

1462
01:20:34,898 --> 01:20:36,465
HERE'S SOME FROGS."

1463
01:20:36,499 --> 01:20:38,077
AND EVERYBODY STARTED CUTTING
THEM AND I JUST WAS LIKE,

1464
01:20:38,101 --> 01:20:39,969
"NAH, I JUST LIKE
TO EAT THINGS WHOLE."

1465
01:20:40,003 --> 01:20:41,637
SO I PICKED UP MY FROG
AND I ATE IT.

1466
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,873
THEY CALL IT "DISSECTING,"

1467
01:20:43,907 --> 01:20:46,409
WHICH IS I THINK IS
THE JEWISH WORD FOR "FEEDING."

1468
01:20:46,442 --> 01:20:51,047
- GOING SOMEWHERE?

1469
01:20:52,515 --> 01:20:55,084
- SO WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE?

1470
01:20:55,118 --> 01:20:58,354
ME OR YOUR FRIEND?

1471
01:20:58,387 --> 01:21:01,925
- ROOKIE!

1472
01:21:01,958 --> 01:21:04,093
- HAVE A NICE DAY.

1473
01:21:10,133 --> 01:21:14,437
Narrator: BUT IN THE END,
IT ALL CAME DOWN TO GARY.

1474
01:21:18,975 --> 01:21:22,979
- WE'RE GETTING OUT OF HERE,
ROOKIE.

1475
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:27,416
GO.

1476
01:21:33,689 --> 01:21:35,058
- MENTOR!

1477
01:22:00,716 --> 01:22:05,054
- ROOK, IT'S KRAVELLO.

1478
01:22:05,088 --> 01:22:06,365
WHAT WAS IT YOU SAID TO THE KID?

1479
01:22:06,389 --> 01:22:08,624
SAME THING ROCKY BALBOA
SAID TO HIS KID.

1480
01:22:08,657 --> 01:22:10,093
"IT AIN'T HOW HARD YOU CAN HIT.

1481
01:22:10,126 --> 01:22:11,303
"IT'S HOW HARD YOU CAN GET HIT

1482
01:22:11,327 --> 01:22:12,495
"AND KEEP MOVING FORWARD.

1483
01:22:12,528 --> 01:22:14,530
"HOW MUCH YOU CAN TAKE

1484
01:22:14,563 --> 01:22:18,034
AND KEEP MOVING FORWARD."

1485
01:22:18,067 --> 01:22:19,435
GET UP, GARY!

1486
01:22:38,587 --> 01:22:41,757
- I MUST BREAK YOU.

1487
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:44,393
- GO FOR IT.

1488
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:49,232
- HEY, GUYS! WE DID IT!

1489
01:22:49,265 --> 01:22:51,234
- OH, YOU THINK SO, HUH?

1490
01:22:51,267 --> 01:22:55,371
WELL, WHERE ARE YOUR TWO BUDDIES
NOW, HUH, ENERGY VAMPIRE?

1491
01:22:55,404 --> 01:22:58,007
- THEY'RE IN THE SHED WITH PAUL.

1492
01:22:58,041 --> 01:23:00,109
OR THEIR BODIES ARE ANYHOW.

1493
01:23:06,349 --> 01:23:12,355
- * WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE

1494
01:23:23,132 --> 01:23:24,667
- IT AIN'T HOW HARD YOU CAN HIT.

1495
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,702
IT'S HOW HARD YOU CAN GET HIT.

1496
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:39,515
- MENTOR GOT HIS SUPER RETARD
STRENGTH BACK.

1497
01:23:39,548 --> 01:23:41,684
- HOW? YOU THOUGHT ABOUT LISA?

1498
01:23:41,717 --> 01:23:44,153
OH, MR. TROPHY.

1499
01:23:44,187 --> 01:23:48,824
- ACTUALLY, I JUST THOUGHT
ABOUT HOW HE HURT MY FRIENDS.

1500
01:23:58,834 --> 01:24:00,469
- IT'S JARED
AND THE MISSING KIDS.

1501
01:24:04,807 --> 01:24:07,776
- WHO RAISED THESE BRATS?

1502
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:10,646
- THIS IS WHY
I HATE ABDUCTED CHILDREN.

1503
01:24:10,679 --> 01:24:13,649
THEY'RE SO INCONSIDERATE.

1504
01:24:13,682 --> 01:24:16,852
DELINQUENTS!

1505
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:18,721
- I'M EMILY FRANCES
LIVE ON THE SCENE,

1506
01:24:18,754 --> 01:24:21,290
AND POLICE ARE EN ROUTE
AS WE SPEAK.

1507
01:24:21,324 --> 01:24:23,526
IT'S A BIZARRE
AND INSIDIOUS SCHEME.

1508
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:26,229
MOTORCYCLE OUTLAW
RALPH "BIG CHICKEN" MORELLI

1509
01:24:26,262 --> 01:24:29,865
WAS ABDUCTING CHILDREN
TO USE AS SLAVE LABOR

1510
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:31,734
TO BUILD TOYS, OF ALL THINGS.

1511
01:24:31,767 --> 01:24:35,304
WELL, IT TURNS OUT
THE ALLEGED PLAN

1512
01:24:35,338 --> 01:24:36,839
WAS TO MAKE ENOUGH TOYS TO WIN

1513
01:24:36,872 --> 01:24:40,176
THE SPRINGLE BELL TOY RUN
TROPHY.

1514
01:24:40,209 --> 01:24:42,645
A $200,000 REWARD WAS OFFERED.

1515
01:24:42,678 --> 01:24:44,647
- HMM. THOUGHTS?

1516
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:46,715
IT IS JARED.

1517
01:24:46,749 --> 01:24:48,151

1518
01:24:48,184 --> 01:24:49,685

01:24:49,718 --> 01:24:52,455
- OKAY, WE'RE DONE HERE.
I SAID GO.

1520
01:24:52,488 --> 01:24:54,490
KIDS.

1521
01:24:54,523 --> 01:24:57,360
- GREGORY, YOU WANT TO DO
THIS INTERVIEW WITH ME?

1522
01:24:57,393 --> 01:24:58,861
- WELL, THANK YOU, FRIEND,

1523
01:24:58,894 --> 01:25:03,666
BUT I NO LONGER
REQUIRE THE ADULATION.

1524
01:25:03,699 --> 01:25:07,303

THIS MAN SINGLE-HANDEDLY
SAVED DOZENS OF LIVES.

1528
01:25:26,489 --> 01:25:28,257
HOW DID YOU DO IT?

1529
01:25:28,291 --> 01:25:30,826
- UH, WELL,
IT WASN'T SINGLE-HANDEDLY.

1530
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:34,863
I HAD HELP FROM
MY NEW PARTNER, GRAHAM.

1531
01:25:34,897 --> 01:25:36,765
- GARY AND GRAHAM,

1532
01:25:36,799 --> 01:25:39,835
WHAT MESSAGE WOULD YOU CONVEY
TO THE RESCUED CHILDREN,

1533
01:25:39,868 --> 01:25:42,305
THEIR PARENTS,

1534
01:25:43,706 --> 01:25:45,841
- PLEASE MAKE MR. TROPHY

Narrator: TURNED OUT
THE BUDDIES WERE RIGHT.

1542
01:26:37,893 --> 01:26:41,464
IT WAS TRULY
THE BEST SPRING BREAK EVER.

1543
01:27:20,403 --> 01:27:22,838
- THE LAWN MOVER REALLY HELPS.

1544
01:27:29,712 --> 01:27:30,979
* I GO TO WORK

01:27:31,013 --> 01:27:33,282
