So, my younger brother,
his name is Charlie.

of that little guy.

for right now,

364
00:29:05,771 --> 00:29:07,739
and Mr. Smith will be right on
to tell you where to go next.

365
00:29:07,874 --> 00:29:09,808
You'll have to
fill out the paperwork

366
00:29:09,943 --> 00:29:11,143
for this gentleman.

367
00:29:11,276 --> 00:29:12,979
It's required by law.

368
00:29:13,111 --> 00:29:15,280
Those of you who've already
filled out the paperwork

369
00:29:15,414 --> 00:29:18,183
can just step to the front
of the line over there.

370
00:29:18,317 --> 00:29:19,886
We'll bring out the children.

371
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:21,020
[man] I need some strong boys
for helping me [indistinct].

372
00:29:21,153 --> 00:29:22,287
It's gonna be okay.

373
00:29:22,421 --> 00:29:23,422
[Frank] Oh, we got
strong ones and...

374
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:24,924
and strong girls too.

375
00:29:25,058 --> 00:29:26,358
[man 1] Do they have names?

376
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:28,160
[Frank] Oh yeah,
they all have names.

377
00:29:28,293 --> 00:29:29,829
[door opens]

378
00:29:39,137 --> 00:29:41,406
Everyone,
get off the train.

379
00:29:51,116 --> 00:29:52,852
Follow me
and we'll form a line.

380
00:29:55,754 --> 00:29:57,122
Watch your step.

381
00:29:58,457 --> 00:30:00,192
[Frank] Step right down.

382
00:30:00,325 --> 00:30:01,426
There you go.

383
00:30:04,796 --> 00:30:06,131
There you go, Jimmy.

384
00:30:06,264 --> 00:30:08,166
[grunting] There we go.

385
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,036
[man] Please form a line
at the stand.

386
00:30:10,168 --> 00:30:12,839
[Frank] There we go, little one.

387
00:30:12,972 --> 00:30:14,239
Got it, young lady?

388
00:30:14,373 --> 00:30:15,707
There you go.

389
00:30:15,842 --> 00:30:16,708
[Lizzy] Phil!

390
00:30:16,843 --> 00:30:18,210
[Phil] Lizzy!

391
00:30:18,343 --> 00:30:19,511
Phil!

392
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:21,647
It's okay.

393
00:30:22,814 --> 00:30:23,782
Watch your step.

394
00:30:27,219 --> 00:30:28,453
Hey, buddy.

395
00:30:28,587 --> 00:30:31,823
Oh, my gosh.
Look how big you've grown.

396
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:33,860
- Dang. [chuckles]
- [soft chuckle]

397
00:30:33,993 --> 00:30:38,330
Hey. Hey, uh, Lily, I...
I know you may not remember me.

398
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:41,299
Uh, but I'm your older brother,
Phil.

399
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:43,002
I'm gonna take care of you.
Okay?

400
00:30:43,136 --> 00:30:45,470
She hasn't talked
since Mother and Father died.

401
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,242
Okay. [sighs]

402
00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:51,543
That's all your stuff
right there?

403
00:30:51,677 --> 00:30:53,245
- Yeah.
- All right, I'll get that...

404
00:30:53,378 --> 00:30:55,213
Sir, you will need, uh, to
fill out the proper paperwork.

405
00:30:55,347 --> 00:30:57,150
Okay. All right,
you guys get in line.

406
00:30:57,282 --> 00:30:58,183
I'll be right back.

407
00:30:58,316 --> 00:30:59,518
Okay.

408
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,591
[horse neighing]

409
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:09,227
Ingrid?

410
00:31:09,361 --> 00:31:12,065
All right, parents,
step up to the front.

411
00:31:12,197 --> 00:31:13,665
We'll need your paperwork.

412
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:15,168
Come on up.
Come on up.

413
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,169
Don't be afraid.

414
00:31:16,301 --> 00:31:18,203
Thank you.

415
00:31:20,873 --> 00:31:22,240
[horse neighing]

416
00:31:23,241 --> 00:31:24,911
This way, please.

417
00:31:25,044 --> 00:31:27,947
[muted chatter]

418
00:31:37,322 --> 00:31:38,490
Uh-uh.

419
00:31:40,893 --> 00:31:42,028
Step this way.

420
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:43,295
Thank you.

421
00:31:43,428 --> 00:31:44,529
Thank you, sir.

422
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:47,432
This way, please.

423
00:31:49,434 --> 00:31:50,302
Paperwork looks good to me.

424
00:31:50,435 --> 00:31:51,636
Next group.

425
00:31:53,405 --> 00:31:54,239
What's your name?

426
00:31:54,372 --> 00:31:55,540
Emily.

427
00:31:55,674 --> 00:31:58,077
Hi, Emily.
Welcome to our family.

428
00:31:58,211 --> 00:32:00,146
Next.

429
00:32:00,278 --> 00:32:02,547
In our house,
you earn your keep.

430
00:32:02,681 --> 00:32:04,984
You work hard, get rewarded
with a good supper.

431
00:32:05,118 --> 00:32:07,920
If you don't work hard,
you hit the road.

432
00:32:08,054 --> 00:32:10,355
In this house, I'm the law.
That understood?

433
00:32:10,489 --> 00:32:11,790
[in unison] Yes, sir.

434
00:32:11,924 --> 00:32:12,925
- Is that understood?
- [in unison] Yes, sir.

435
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:14,793
All right. Come on.

436
00:32:14,927 --> 00:32:16,863
Come on down this way.
Right around.

437
00:32:16,996 --> 00:32:19,297
Come on now. Come on.

438
00:32:23,702 --> 00:32:26,738
For Charlie, Lizzy,
and Lily Calgrove, please.

439
00:32:28,707 --> 00:32:29,775
[Lizzy]
That's my brother, Phil.

440
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:33,545
Phil, can we take Mary with us?

441
00:32:33,678 --> 00:32:35,181
I'm so...
I'm sorry, children.

442
00:32:35,313 --> 00:32:38,918
I have, uh, Addison, Mary,
Johnny, Ray and Jacob down

443
00:32:39,051 --> 00:32:41,954
as all getting adopted
by the Smith family and they...

444
00:32:42,088 --> 00:32:43,555
they've not shown up yet.

445
00:32:43,688 --> 00:32:47,093
If they don't show up
by tomorrow morning,

446
00:32:47,226 --> 00:32:48,660
you'll go back on the train.

447
00:32:48,794 --> 00:32:50,897
But... but tonight you'll sleep
in the local orphanage.

448
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:54,000
Wait, what about Jimmy?

449
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:57,536
Uh. well, the family
didn't take Jimmy.

450
00:32:57,669 --> 00:33:01,773
Uh, lots of times, they don't
take the older children.

451
00:33:05,845 --> 00:33:06,645
Bye.

452
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:08,480
My dad gave me this doll.

453
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:10,049
I'd like you to have it.

454
00:33:12,751 --> 00:33:13,685
Bye.

455
00:33:15,353 --> 00:33:17,857
All right, uh,
Lily, Lizzy, Charlie,

456
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:20,159
it's time to get goin'.

457
00:33:20,293 --> 00:33:24,096
Here. I got this for ya.

458
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,564
Go on, sweetheart.

459
00:33:27,266 --> 00:33:28,667
Bye.

460
00:33:36,209 --> 00:33:37,944
You're one brave cowboy.

461
00:33:38,077 --> 00:33:41,314
And sometimes, cowboys have to
part ways to their cattle.

462
00:33:47,053 --> 00:33:48,753
All right, bud. [sighs]

463
00:33:54,327 --> 00:33:57,429
[incidental music]

464
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,909
[horse nickers]

465
00:34:10,042 --> 00:34:12,979
[panting]

466
00:34:29,561 --> 00:34:31,330
I beg you,
please help me.

467
00:34:31,463 --> 00:34:32,832
My daughter has been taken.

468
00:34:32,965 --> 00:34:34,100
[panting]

469
00:34:34,233 --> 00:34:35,400
Please.

470
00:34:36,434 --> 00:34:38,004
You lost?

471
00:34:38,137 --> 00:34:40,940
Ain't much around here but men
returnin' home from the war.

472
00:34:42,407 --> 00:34:46,745
And for a Black woman,
it ain't a safe place to be.

473
00:34:55,221 --> 00:34:56,889
There's a town.

474
00:34:58,124 --> 00:35:00,659
about 25 miles back
the way we came.

475
00:35:06,631 --> 00:35:07,532
- Thank you.
- I'm sure there's someone

476
00:35:07,666 --> 00:35:08,767
there can help you.

477
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:12,838
[horse nickers]

478
00:35:19,678 --> 00:35:21,047
[horse neighs]

479
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:26,818
Keep the guns down.

480
00:35:28,187 --> 00:35:29,688
Looks like we got a couple of
no-good Yanks.

481
00:35:29,821 --> 00:35:31,456
[indistinct] Yankees.

482
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:32,992
[horse nickers]

483
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:35,394
War's over.
You guys keep on movin'.

484
00:35:35,527 --> 00:35:37,063
Over when we say it's over.

485
00:35:37,196 --> 00:35:39,432
How 'bout I just rip you
off that horse?

486
00:35:39,564 --> 00:35:41,067
[gun clicks]

487
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,503
[tense music]

488
00:35:45,637 --> 00:35:46,738
Keep goin'.

489
00:35:54,746 --> 00:35:56,148
We gotta keep moving.

490
00:35:56,282 --> 00:35:58,550
I want to rip their throats out
just as bad as you do.

491
00:36:00,052 --> 00:36:02,955
[muted chatter]

492
00:36:10,628 --> 00:36:12,832
- [Alice screaming]
- [horse neighs]

493
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:19,637
- [soldiers laughing]
- [Alice screaming]

494
00:36:21,841 --> 00:36:22,908
[guns firing]

495
00:36:23,042 --> 00:36:25,945
[Alice weeping]

496
00:36:30,016 --> 00:36:31,851
One more step, she's done!

497
00:36:34,686 --> 00:36:36,055
She's done!

498
00:36:40,592 --> 00:36:41,626
One more step...!

499
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,796
- [gun fires]
- [Alice crying]

500
00:36:50,336 --> 00:36:51,669
[gun fires]

501
00:36:52,637 --> 00:36:54,073
Come with us.

502
00:36:57,176 --> 00:37:00,212
- [fire crackling]
- [dramatic music]

503
00:37:09,221 --> 00:37:10,523
[Edward] Your daughter.

504
00:37:10,655 --> 00:37:14,759
was in an alley living
out of a cardboard box.

505
00:37:14,894 --> 00:37:17,229
You gave us no choice
but to remove her.

506
00:37:18,831 --> 00:37:21,901
[crying]
Don't you tell me that!

507
00:37:23,936 --> 00:37:26,771
You don't know what I've
been through to find freedom!

508
00:37:28,174 --> 00:37:30,242
Now to have my child
ripped away!

509
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:34,146
You tell me what
my child is right now!

510
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,548
Right now!

511
00:37:38,417 --> 00:37:39,784
Please, I beg you, sir.

512
00:37:39,919 --> 00:37:41,820
I beg you, please.
She ain't ever been without me.

513
00:37:41,954 --> 00:37:43,456
I'm a good mother. I promise,
I'm a good mother.

514
00:37:43,588 --> 00:37:46,392
I promise. [crying]

515
00:37:46,525 --> 00:37:48,227
I'm a good mom.

516
00:37:53,631 --> 00:37:54,732
Forgive me.

517
00:37:56,302 --> 00:37:57,536
Now, let's see
what we can do for you.

518
00:37:57,669 --> 00:38:00,005
[paper rustling]

519
00:38:00,139 --> 00:38:01,373
[sniffles]

520
00:38:01,507 --> 00:38:03,976
Looks like Mary is on a train
heading to Missouri

521
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,810
with about 40 other children.

522
00:38:08,314 --> 00:38:12,017
She will be at the orphanage,
in good care.

523
00:38:14,186 --> 00:38:17,089
[fire crackling]

524
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,627
[horse neighs]

525
00:38:25,097 --> 00:38:26,999
You sure your daughter's
on that Orphan Train?

526
00:38:43,549 --> 00:38:46,886
I lost two years of my life
in those Confederate camps.

527
00:38:49,355 --> 00:38:52,424
My babies' voices echoed
through my head every day.

528
00:38:56,694 --> 00:38:58,197
It's what kept me from dyin'.

529
00:39:03,869 --> 00:39:05,171
How old is your daughter?

530
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:08,740
She's 10.

531
00:39:09,674 --> 00:39:10,675
You said her name was?

532
00:39:10,808 --> 00:39:11,776
- Mary.
- Mary?

533
00:39:11,911 --> 00:39:13,212
Mary Beggs.

534
00:39:13,345 --> 00:39:14,947
Mary.

535
00:39:20,653 --> 00:39:23,755
[mellow music]

536
00:39:30,262 --> 00:39:32,198
Where are you
headed off to?

537
00:39:35,267 --> 00:39:37,269
Told you that you can't
get emotionally involved

538
00:39:37,403 --> 00:39:39,737
with these men
who come in here.

539
00:39:39,872 --> 00:39:41,739
They aren't safe.

540
00:39:54,486 --> 00:39:55,921
I never wanted this life.

541
00:39:56,055 --> 00:39:58,357
Do you think
any of us want this life?

542
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:03,229
I hate myself for bringing you
here with me and Jimmy.

543
00:40:04,563 --> 00:40:07,633
When he died, I thought
I could work here

544
00:40:07,765 --> 00:40:10,202
until I found another man or...

545
00:40:10,336 --> 00:40:14,006
or got me an honest job
to take care of you.

546
00:40:14,139 --> 00:40:19,044
I never intended to drag you
into this dark hole with me.

547
00:40:19,178 --> 00:40:21,547
We can leave
in the morning.

548
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,015
And never look back.

549
00:40:24,617 --> 00:40:26,151
I met an honest soldier.

550
00:40:26,285 --> 00:40:27,553
He ain't your normal man.
He just wanted to talk to me.

551
00:40:27,686 --> 00:40:29,588
Ingrid, you little fool.

552
00:40:29,722 --> 00:40:31,090
Where do you think
this honest man

553
00:40:31,223 --> 00:40:33,192
is goin' to take you?

554
00:40:33,325 --> 00:40:34,593
What do you think
is gonna happen?

555
00:40:34,727 --> 00:40:35,861
[bangs table]
I'm leaving!

556
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:41,066
I would rather die
a gruesome death

557
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,903
than spend one more night here
havin' a man touch me.

558
00:40:47,539 --> 00:40:49,774
I remember
when we was little girls.

559
00:40:52,044 --> 00:40:53,445
We used to run through
the sunflower fields

560
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:55,180
in North Carolina.

561
00:40:56,682 --> 00:40:58,984
You used to tell me
that dreams are from God.

562
00:41:00,552 --> 00:41:04,822
And that when you stop dreaming,
you stop living.

563
00:41:07,493 --> 00:41:09,361
Sarah, we aren't living.

564
00:41:13,065 --> 00:41:14,799
Dreams aren't real.

565
00:41:15,901 --> 00:41:17,903
I ain't too sure God is real.

566
00:41:19,705 --> 00:41:22,308
But I ain't goin' to stop you
from leavin' here.

567
00:41:40,726 --> 00:41:42,361
[sniffles]

568
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,303
[receding footsteps]

569
00:41:55,074 --> 00:41:56,542
There you go.

570
00:41:56,675 --> 00:41:58,177
Lily, this is yours.

571
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,645
- And Charlie.
- Thank you.

572
00:41:59,778 --> 00:42:01,547
- There you go.
- Ooo, muffins are my favorite.

573
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,918
And last, but certainly
not least, Miss Lizzy.

574
00:42:06,051 --> 00:42:07,786
Thank you.

575
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,621
You're welcome.

576
00:42:11,857 --> 00:42:17,629
So, I got some news. The Army
is relocating me up to Montana.

577
00:42:17,763 --> 00:42:21,300
That means that we're going to
be leaving tomorrow morning.

578
00:42:21,433 --> 00:42:24,670
I think it will be
a good start for all of us.

579
00:42:24,803 --> 00:42:26,138
What will we do up there?

580
00:42:26,271 --> 00:42:28,474
The Army has given me
some land by a river.

581
00:42:28,607 --> 00:42:30,409
And, um.

582
00:42:30,542 --> 00:42:32,244
I plan on turning it
into a farm.

583
00:42:32,378 --> 00:42:34,747
So, we'll be raising crops,
and we'll have horses

584
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,582
and we'll have sheep and cattle.

585
00:42:36,715 --> 00:42:38,183
And there's even a town.

586
00:42:38,317 --> 00:42:39,885
And in that town,
there's a little school

587
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:41,320
that I'll take you all to.

588
00:42:41,453 --> 00:42:43,288
Oh, can I fish
on the river?

589
00:42:43,422 --> 00:42:44,923
I used to love fishing
with Father.

590
00:42:45,057 --> 00:42:46,492
[soft chuckle]
You can fish all you want.

591
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:48,862
Yeah. As a family.

592
00:42:48,994 --> 00:42:50,830
Yeah.
But I caught the most fish.

593
00:42:50,963 --> 00:42:52,197
[chuckles]

594
00:43:00,739 --> 00:43:03,008
Did you see Father die?

595
00:43:07,813 --> 00:43:09,648
No.

596
00:43:12,951 --> 00:43:14,086
[knock on door]

597
00:43:19,258 --> 00:43:20,860
[door squeaks open]

598
00:43:20,993 --> 00:43:22,194
Hi.

599
00:43:22,327 --> 00:43:24,163
Uh, hi.

600
00:43:24,296 --> 00:43:26,165
Uh, come in, come in.

601
00:43:28,634 --> 00:43:30,669
Hi. I'm Lizzy.

602
00:43:30,803 --> 00:43:33,572
Hello, Lizzy.
Nice to meet you. I'm Ingrid.

603
00:43:33,705 --> 00:43:34,606
Hi, Charlie.

604
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:35,707
Hello, Lily.

605
00:43:38,777 --> 00:43:40,646
Um, here. Let me give you
somethin' to eat.

606
00:43:43,482 --> 00:43:45,250
The three of you
sure look alike.

607
00:43:45,384 --> 00:43:47,686
Uh, Charlie,
Lily, and Lizzy, uh,

608
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:50,155
Ingrid is a. a friend of mine.

609
00:43:53,992 --> 00:43:57,362
Um.
Can I come with you to Montana?

610
00:43:57,496 --> 00:43:59,798
I won't be any trouble.
I just.

611
00:43:59,933 --> 00:44:01,433
I want a better life.

612
00:44:03,602 --> 00:44:06,071
I think it would be
nice for her to come with us.

613
00:44:07,673 --> 00:44:13,111
Yeah. Um, I... [sighing]
I suppose, yeah.

614
00:44:14,513 --> 00:44:15,581
Thank you.

615
00:44:15,714 --> 00:44:17,483
Ingrid, do you think
you can talk Phil

616
00:44:17,616 --> 00:44:21,053
into letting our friends
come with us to Montana?

617
00:44:21,186 --> 00:44:22,654
I don't think
they have any homes.

618
00:44:22,788 --> 00:44:24,790
Um, they made friends
with other children

619
00:44:24,924 --> 00:44:26,291
on the Orphan Train,

620
00:44:26,425 --> 00:44:30,162
and they didn't get
adopted this morning.

621
00:44:30,295 --> 00:44:31,663
But you know what?

622
00:44:31,797 --> 00:44:33,465
I know you had a long day
today on the trains.

623
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,000
And we're gonna have
a very long day tomorrow,

624
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:36,702
'cause if we're
gonna be traveling,

625
00:44:36,836 --> 00:44:38,270
we're gonna have to pack up.

626
00:44:38,403 --> 00:44:40,506
So, I think it's time
for you guys to get to bed.

627
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:43,008
I can make a pallet
for them by the fireplace.

628
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:44,409
- Oh.
- Lizzy and Lily,

629
00:44:44,543 --> 00:44:45,879
how about I braid your hair
before bed?

630
00:44:46,011 --> 00:44:47,412
- Okay.
- Yeah.

631
00:44:47,546 --> 00:44:49,147
Okay.

632
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:08,534
[birds chirping]

633
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:10,736

640
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:18,170
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

641
00:46:18,303 --> 00:46:19,171
Go, go, go, go.

642
00:46:19,304 --> 00:46:20,405

00:46:38,858 --> 00:46:40,359
[Desmond] Jack,
there're too many!

00:46:51,203 --> 00:46:52,638

[Alice gasps]

655
00:47:08,687 --> 00:47:09,922
[Jack] Thanks for the help,
soldier.

656
00:47:13,325 --> 00:47:16,428
[soft music]

657
00:47:17,864 --> 00:47:18,764
Let's move out.

658
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,036
There may be more comin'.

659
00:47:23,168 --> 00:47:24,269
Come on.

660
00:47:24,403 --> 00:47:27,539
[dramatic music]

661
00:47:32,344 --> 00:47:35,247
[soft music]

662
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,851
[Shantu] We've been tracking
these Apaches for a while now.

663
00:47:38,985 --> 00:47:39,952
Lieutenant Calgrove.

664
00:47:40,086 --> 00:47:41,154
Shantu.

665
00:47:41,286 --> 00:47:43,522
United States Army, Company K.

666
00:47:43,655 --> 00:47:45,691
Ah, you're the Native Union
sharpshooting group.

667
00:47:45,824 --> 00:47:47,359
Yes, sir.

668
00:47:47,492 --> 00:47:48,861
Wait a minute.

669
00:47:48,995 --> 00:47:50,930
Calgrove.

670
00:47:51,064 --> 00:47:52,731
The letter, please.

671
00:47:52,865 --> 00:47:54,033
[Jack] What letter?

672
00:47:54,167 --> 00:47:55,434
[Shantu] You're the father
coming for his children.

673
00:47:55,567 --> 00:47:56,836
Here's a letter
we're delivering

674
00:47:56,969 --> 00:47:58,637
to the station
in Independence, Missouri.

675
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:00,372
[Jack] But why didn't it
get there?

676
00:48:00,505 --> 00:48:02,240
[Shantu] We guard
these Orphan Trains at night.

677
00:48:02,374 --> 00:48:03,809
We'll pull over
to pick on those Apaches

678
00:48:03,943 --> 00:48:05,310
you just encountered.

679
00:48:05,444 --> 00:48:07,880
And it took us far off track.

680
00:48:08,014 --> 00:48:11,616
My son, Phillip Calgrove,
lives in Independence, Missouri.

681
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:13,452
That's where he's stationed.

682
00:48:13,585 --> 00:48:15,253
They're supposed to be
holding them with him there.

683
00:48:15,387 --> 00:48:16,621
How far is it?

684
00:48:16,755 --> 00:48:18,724
It's about
a hundred miles from here.

685
00:48:18,858 --> 00:48:19,758
Let's move.

686
00:48:22,761 --> 00:48:25,664
[dramatic music]

687
00:48:33,873 --> 00:48:36,775
[clattering]

688
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:40,245
The kids are still sleeping.

689
00:48:40,378 --> 00:48:41,413
Mornin'.

690
00:48:41,546 --> 00:48:44,282
[footsteps]

691
00:48:44,416 --> 00:48:45,885
All, uh, all loaded up now.

692
00:48:49,588 --> 00:48:51,523
[Phil sighs deeply]

693
00:48:51,656 --> 00:48:52,758
Is everything okay?

694
00:48:54,894 --> 00:48:57,796

[soft music]

697
00:49:14,713 --> 00:49:16,581
We don't.
we don't know each other,

698
00:49:16,715 --> 00:49:20,385
but what I do know is
we seem to be

699
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:22,788
in the same place
in our lives.

700
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:27,492
We're both searching
for a greater purpose.

701
00:49:32,198 --> 00:49:33,765
[inhales]

702
00:49:36,768 --> 00:49:37,702
I just.

703
00:49:38,871 --> 00:49:41,473
I just can't walk in there
and adopt six children.

704
00:49:46,812 --> 00:49:48,480
I can barely
take care of myself.

705
00:49:50,415 --> 00:49:51,918
[Ingrid exhales]

706
00:49:52,919 --> 00:49:54,887
I had stopped
believing in goodness.

707
00:49:56,454 --> 00:49:57,924
Until the night we met.

708
00:50:02,061 --> 00:50:03,896
From that night on, I.

709
00:50:05,164 --> 00:50:07,867
I started thinking maybe
there's another way for me.

710
00:50:11,603 --> 00:50:14,706
Maybe with these children,
I [sniffles].

711
00:50:18,878 --> 00:50:20,445
I could be worth something.

712
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:22,614
[sniffles]

713
00:50:23,682 --> 00:50:24,951
I can help you.

714
00:50:29,654 --> 00:50:30,923
We can do it.

715
00:50:35,594 --> 00:50:37,362
[Phil inhales]

716
00:50:37,495 --> 00:50:40,166

718
00:50:55,814 --> 00:50:57,917
Mary, Addi,
Johnny, Jacob, Ray, Jimmy,

719
00:50:58,050 --> 00:50:59,551

727
00:51:18,971 --> 00:51:20,072
[Lizzy] No, sir.

728
00:51:20,206 --> 00:51:22,241
We would like to take
our friends with us.

729
00:51:22,375 --> 00:51:25,344
I'd, uh, like to formally
adopt all these children

730
00:51:25,477 --> 00:51:26,312
that were left behind.

731
00:51:26,444 --> 00:51:27,445
You serious, sir?

732
00:51:27,579 --> 00:51:28,480
Dead serious.

733
00:51:28,613 --> 00:51:30,917
Whoo!

734
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:33,986
We could use your help on
the farm from all of you guys.

735
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:37,390
[soft chuckle]
Well, you'll all be glad

736
00:51:37,522 --> 00:51:39,892
to have a family again, right?

737
00:51:40,026 --> 00:51:41,626
- [Lizzy] Yes.
- [Charlie] Yes, sir.

738
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,896
I'll get the paperwork
and you can be on your way.

739
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:45,998

[Ray] Goodbye, Frank.

I'll miss you, Ray.

748
00:52:00,545 --> 00:52:01,746
I'll miss you too.

749
00:52:03,282 --> 00:52:04,449
Goodbye, Jimmy.

750
00:52:07,286 --> 00:52:08,421
Good luck to ya.

751
00:52:08,553 --> 00:52:09,487

Charlie, why don't you
get up here

763
00:53:04,477 --> 00:53:05,211
and show 'em how it's done.

- Okay.

[Phil] On your sights.

767
00:53:13,853 --> 00:53:15,054
Sit back, everybody.

Dang, Charlie.

771
00:53:21,093 --> 00:53:23,362
- [Lizzy] Yeah, Charlie.
- Bull's eye, buddy.

772
00:53:23,496 --> 00:53:25,297
Doesn't surprise me
at all, buddy.

00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,401
Can I go next?

776
00:53:28,533 --> 00:53:29,634
Yeah, get up here.

777
00:53:29,768 --> 00:53:31,103
All right,
just like your brother,

778
00:53:31,237 --> 00:53:33,005
right at those tin cans
I set up.

779
00:53:33,139 --> 00:53:34,073
Okay.

780
00:53:35,241 --> 00:53:37,143
Now, it's a little loud,
so I'm gonna cover your ears.

781
00:53:37,276 --> 00:53:39,945
All right.
Line up a little bit.

782
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:41,579
You got it?

00:53:41,713 --> 00:53:42,614

00:53:42,747 --> 00:53:44,383
[kids] Ooh.

785
00:53:44,517 --> 00:53:45,518
Nice shooting, cowgirl.

786
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:46,718
Thanks.

787
00:53:46,852 --> 00:53:48,521
Dang, Lizzy,
you can shoot.

788
00:53:48,653 --> 00:53:50,622
I'll go. That's easy.

789
00:53:50,755 --> 00:53:52,757
Hit that one right there.

790
00:53:52,892 --> 00:53:54,160
[Phil] Here you go.

791
00:53:54,293 --> 00:53:56,929
Now just like the other two,
line it up.

792
00:53:57,063 --> 00:53:58,297
Now let her rip
when you're ready.

793
00:53:59,298 --> 00:54:00,665
[Ray] Which one of these
is the trigger?

794
00:54:00,799 --> 00:54:02,201
- [kids] Whoa.
- Hey.

795
00:54:02,334 --> 00:54:04,837
All right, so first
rule of handling a gun is,

796
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:06,839
you never aim
at another person.

797
00:54:06,972 --> 00:54:08,374
[Charlie] Only if
it's the bad guy, though.

798
00:54:08,507 --> 00:54:10,608
Thank you, Charlie.
Only if it's the bad guy.

supper's ready.

All right,
we'll do this later.

Missouri, Lieutenant.

815
00:55:27,186 --> 00:55:28,487
Looking for
the local orphanage.

816
00:55:28,621 --> 00:55:30,256
Can you point us
in that direction?

817
00:55:30,389 --> 00:55:32,558
Down that way
at the edge of town.

they're on a wagon train

were forced West,

861

and they had their land
seized by the government.

862
00:57:06,818 --> 00:57:11,023
They blamed the settlers and
started raiding the whole area.

We had to station men
at different posts

969
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:44,736
Charles told me, "You run,
and you don't look back."

Well, I circled back and.

971
