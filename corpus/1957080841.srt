[man] <i>Hello? Yes,</i>

00:01:28,723 --> 00:01:29,591
<i>thank you for accepting
the call.</i>

10
00:01:29,624 --> 00:01:30,959
Uh, can I speak to Greg Bernard,
please?

11
00:01:30,992 --> 00:01:33,861
[woman over phone] <i>Mr. Reid,
Mr. Bernard isn't available.</i>

12
00:01:33,895 --> 00:01:35,462
All right, can you put me
through to his cellphone?

13
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,130
It's urgent that I speak to him.

14
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:38,733
There was a situation
in general population.

15
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,233
It wasn't my fault,
but they sent me

16
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,402
to solitary confinement
for it as punishment.

17
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,105
[woman] <i>I apologize.
I can let Mr. Bernard know.</i>

18
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:47,174
No, ma'am, just don't apologize.

19
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,175
Just listen to me, okay?

20
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,243
They... they've confiscated
all my belongings.

21
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:53,347
I don't have anything,
not a pencil, not a paper.

22
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:55,382
So unless Greg can help me
retrieve my things,

23
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:56,818
I won't be able to mail out
my statement

24
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:58,052
for petition to appeal.

25
00:01:58,086 --> 00:01:59,587
It was supposed to go out today
for my hearing next week.

26
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:00,588
Do you understand?

27
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:02,657
[woman]
<i>I'm being informed</i>

28
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,424
<i>that your hearing
was postponed.</i>

29
00:02:07,662 --> 00:02:08,763
[Harlow sighs]

30
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:13,601
Okay, okay. This is... excellent.

31
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,770
Thank you.
When is it rescheduled for?

32
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,672
How long do I have
to get my statement in to Greg?

33
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,874
[woman]
<i>I'm sorry, but</i>

34
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:22,644
<i>your hearing has been
postponed indefinitely.</i>

35
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:30,217
You said you were just informed.

36
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,451
By who,
one of the other partners?

37
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,954
Can I speak to one of them,
please?

38
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:33,821
Put them on the phone.

39
00:02:33,855 --> 00:02:34,722
[tapping gate]

40
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:36,658
They... they're gonna send me
back to my cell.

41
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:38,258
Can you put one of them
on the phone, please?

42
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,460
[woman]
<i>That's just not possible.</i>

43
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,596
I don't think you understand me.

44
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,264
They've given me a life sentence
and I'm innocent.

45
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,298
This is not a joke.

46
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:47,635
[woman]
<i>Mr. Reid, I'm sorry.</i>

47
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:49,904
Why do you keep
apologizing to me?

48
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:51,739
Just put one of them
on the phone.

49
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,642
[woman] <i>You should have
received notice in the mail.</i>

50
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:58,445
<i>You're being sued
in civil court.</i>

51
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:01,314
<i>Your assets have been frozen.</i>

52
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:04,317
<i>And since you're technically
unable to pay,</i>

53
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:08,723
<i>the firm has decided not
to move forward with your case.</i>

54
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:11,693
Greg would not do that to me.

55
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:15,462
We have been friends
since middle school.

56
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,801
[woman] <i>I'm so sorry.
We sent you the documents</i>

57
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:22,570
<i>so you can refile your appeal
with a public defender.</i>

58
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:25,573
<i>Or you can represent yourself.</i>

59
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:28,275
<i>I'm really very sorry.</i>

Let's walk.

64
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:52,466
It's just a random check.

65
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:54,869
For what?

66
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:56,838
[guard 2] What's this?

67
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,678
You know,

68
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,449
there is nothing
that you can think of

69
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:10,685
that I haven't thought first.

70
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:13,821
[music continues]

71
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:27,735
Oh, what's wrong?

72
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,471
I thought all dogs like
the smell of their own rectum.

73
00:04:32,507 --> 00:04:33,574
That's not mine.

74
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:36,611
According to who?

75
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:38,880
It's according to whom.

76
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:42,517
- Oh, it's according to whom.
- [chuckles]

77
00:04:42,917 --> 00:04:44,317
[scoffs] Really?

78
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:45,853
[grunts]

79
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,057
Yeah.

80
00:04:50,992 --> 00:04:52,392
If you were smart
as you think you are,

81
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:53,561
you wouldn't be here,

82
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:55,730
would you, Dr. Reid?

83
00:04:57,999 --> 00:04:59,366
I read your file.

84
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,468
I got a jacket on...

85
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,739
all the inmates here in the SHU.

86
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:07,440
I was already searched.

87
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:08,943
Oh, not by me.

88
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:13,848
You see, if I had to strip
searched you and this turned up

89
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:15,950
stashed in your cavity,

90
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,687
I would have shoved my boot
so far up your ass,

91
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,454
this razor would have
come out of your mouth.

92
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:22,723
Get up.

93
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:27,394
First offense is 90 days.

94
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:31,599
Anything like this
happens again,

95
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,001
I'm gonna add on a whole year.

[man] Hey, you.

99
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:10,872
You like to hurt women? [laughs]

100
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:15,009
Yeah, you know that's why Sacks
is fucking with you, right?

101
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:18,813
Hey, friend,
with all due respect,

102
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:20,715
it's been a long day.

103
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:21,883
I really don't feel like
talking right now,

104
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:24,819
so if you don't mind.

105
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:32,059
Excuse me, guard.

106
00:06:32,093 --> 00:06:33,493
When do I get my belongings?

107
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:36,664
My legal papers.
It's... it's urgent.

108
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:37,531
I need them today.

109
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:39,834
[guard] This ain't
the Four Seasons, motherfucker.

110

00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:50,371
Goddammit, Zeke.

122
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:51,973
Pull the mattress
off the window.

123
00:07:52,006 --> 00:07:54,108
[indistinct shouting]

124
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,911
Keep this up and you will
suffer the consequences.

125
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:59,046
[Zeke] There's things going on
in this prison...

126
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,916
- This ain't right.
- [toilet flushes]

00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:03,918
[indistinct shouting]

128
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,553
The fucking bitches...

129
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,022
- [indistinct shouting]
- [Zeke] Don't!

130
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:09,023
[guard] Zeke!

131
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:10,591
[Zeke] They're never gonna
let me out of here!

132
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:13,094
[indistinct shouting]

133
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:15,963
- [guard] We're coming in.
- [Sacks] Three seconds.

134
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:18,833
[Zeke] No, you come in here...
[indistinct]

135
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:19,867
[Sacks] Three.

136
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,869
[indistinct shouting]

137
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:23,938
[Sacks] Two.

138
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:28,075
One. Open the cell door.

139
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:30,011
[Zeke] Don't!
[shouting indistinctly]

140
00:08:30,044 --> 00:08:30,878
[guard] Zeke, Zeke!

141
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:32,179
[Zeke] Get that bitch
away from me!

142
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:34,682
- [banging]
- [indistinct shouting]

143
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,221
[Zeke] Let go!

144
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:43,557
You're breaking my fucking arm!

145
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,760
You're breaking my arm!

146
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:46,761
Fuck you!

147
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:48,763
[indistinct shouting]

148
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:51,799
[Sacks]
Show the warden some respect.

149
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,000
[Zeke] Let go!

150
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,302
Ow! You're fucking hurting me!

151
00:08:55,336 --> 00:08:57,071
[grunting]

152
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,278
[imitating monkey]

00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:07,982
[ominous music]

154
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:29,737
[indistinct chattering]

155
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:54,829
[Sacks whistles]

156
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:06,340
[Harlow] Excuse me, guard.

157
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:09,643
[Sacks continues whistling]

158
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:14,982
My tray, I don't think
I had a full portion.

159
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:21,922
Can I have a little bit more?

160
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,731
Please?

161
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:52,119
[ominous music]

162
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:15,309
Oh, don't you look nice.

163
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:16,210
Sorry I'm late.

164
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:18,045
It's okay.

165
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:20,347
Understood.

166
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:25,386
Careful.

167
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:26,287
Thank you.

168
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,227
Oh, look.

169
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:36,197
It's our guardian angel.

170
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,805
It's what we call pareidolia.

171
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:47,441
Our brains are wired
to perceive faces in things.

172
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:49,210
It's actually a form of
pattern recognition.

173
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,215
Can't I just appreciate
the view?

174
00:11:57,818 --> 00:11:58,752
You don't think that that's...

175
00:11:58,786 --> 00:11:59,353
Interesting?

176
00:11:59,954 --> 00:12:00,487
Mm-mm.

177
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:09,496
So, you didn't bring any clothes
to work in?

178
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:13,200
I thought the whole point
of buying this boat

179
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:14,902
was so that we can relax.

180
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,838
We haven't even started.

181
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:21,909
Baby, it's such a beautiful day.

182
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:23,410
Why can't we just enjoy it?

183
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:38,826
Why don't we take the boat out
for a lap around the bay,

184
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:41,128
and then we'll work, I promise.

185
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,903
We need this.

186
00:12:51,372 --> 00:12:52,507
We need what?

187
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:00,247
To fix this.

188
00:13:00,481 --> 00:13:02,249
[ominous music]

189
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:25,205
[man] There's a passage
I'd like to share with you,

190
00:13:27,575 --> 00:13:30,911
one that occurs to me
in times like this.

191
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,051
Let every man be subject
to the governing authorities

192
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,387
for there is no authority
except from God.

193
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:43,457
And those authorities
that do exist,

194
00:13:44,058 --> 00:13:46,226
have been instituted by God.

195
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:48,162
Yeah.

196
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:52,132
I don't like
the segregated housing unit.

197
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:55,836
It changes people.

198
00:13:57,404 --> 00:14:01,609
Every time an inmate has to be
extracted, they call me down

199
00:14:03,377 --> 00:14:04,546
and I see it firsthand.

200
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:07,615
That man in the cell
next to you, Zeke,

201
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:12,152
he flooded out his cell
because he was desperate,

202
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:16,123
desperate for human contact.

203
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,228
I have a prison to run.

204
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:24,431
I have a responsibility
to my staff

205
00:14:24,465 --> 00:14:27,234
and to the other inmates
to segregate the troublemakers.

206
00:14:27,502 --> 00:14:28,969
[chuckles] Oh, man.

207
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:42,617
That's not mine.

208
00:14:43,518 --> 00:14:44,351
You know that.

209
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:46,253
It was in your mattress.

210
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,227
Maybe...
I can help you help yourself.

211
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:56,631
If, for instance,
you were willing to enroll

212
00:14:56,664 --> 00:14:59,032
in a behavior modification
program,

213
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:03,505
I can commute your stay
in the segregated housing unit.

214
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:05,540
You would be able to reenter

215
00:15:05,573 --> 00:15:08,008
the general population
immediately.

216
00:15:08,743 --> 00:15:10,578
What does one have to do
to get into this program?

217
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:13,914
[chuckles] Simple.

218
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:16,984
Just obey the rules,

219
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:21,255
and sign a confession.

220
00:15:25,727 --> 00:15:29,129
The road to rehabilitation
starts with acceptance.

221
00:15:29,163 --> 00:15:30,964
[tense music]

222
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:40,974
No.

223
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:47,582
[Zeke] I heard about you,
Harlow.

224
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,119
[Harlow] Any chance you can
move me to a new cell?

225
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,488
You two deserve each other.

226
00:16:03,197 --> 00:16:05,132
[Zeke] Hey, black man.

227
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:07,401
Do you believe in God?

228
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:11,104
[music continues]

229
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:33,360
[Zeke] Hey, you, Harlow.

230
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:37,364
I know you hear me, boy.

231
00:16:38,766 --> 00:16:40,768
I'm trying to save your life.

232
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:45,272
How's that?

233
00:16:49,777 --> 00:16:51,245
If you got something to say,
say it.

234
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:53,413
Otherwise, just leave me alone.

235
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:58,485
[Zeke] Go to your cell door and
look out in the hallway.

236
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:11,398
Do you see them lights,

237
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:13,601
the long ones up there
on the ceiling?

238
00:17:14,536 --> 00:17:16,538
That's where they live.

239
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:21,441
They feed on the energy
and travel through the vents.

240
00:17:22,276 --> 00:17:24,546
That's how they get
into the cells.

241
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,683
Do you believe in ghosts?

242
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:33,153
I'm afraid whatever it is
you think you're seeing,

243
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:37,692
that's just your mind's way
of... of keeping you company.

244
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:39,794
[Zeke] They ain't trying
to keep me company.

245
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:41,328
They're trying to kill me!

246
00:17:43,765 --> 00:17:45,165
Who's trying to kill you?

247
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:49,069
[Zeke] In here,
we all got victims.

248
00:17:49,537 --> 00:17:52,807
Some of those victims, the ones
who ain't with us no more,

249
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:56,143
they're looking for revenge.

250
00:18:03,518 --> 00:18:06,353
It sounds like you're having
a crisis of conscience.

251
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:08,288
[Zeke] Shut up.

252
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:09,489
You sound like a shrink.

253
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:13,427
A psychiatrist, yes.

254
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,697
[Zeke] Don't you try and
talk to me, motherfucker!

255
00:18:18,566 --> 00:18:20,535
Hey, I was not passing judgment.

256
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:29,276
All right, you're the one
that said you wanted to talk.

257
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:33,380
[Zeke] Why don't you tell me
something then?

258
00:18:33,548 --> 00:18:34,448
Like...

259
00:18:35,717 --> 00:18:38,753
how'd you kill your wife?
[laughs]

260
00:18:40,688 --> 00:18:43,123
[tense music]

261
00:18:50,865 --> 00:18:52,466
I'm innocent!

262
00:18:59,707 --> 00:19:00,708
I'm innocent.

263
00:19:02,977 --> 00:19:05,212
[sirens wailing in distance]

264
00:19:09,584 --> 00:19:10,852
[buzzer blares]

265
00:19:14,956 --> 00:19:17,625
[man] So we're downstairs
and I hear this groaning.

266
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:18,559
So I walk down the hall

267
00:19:18,593 --> 00:19:20,695
and I see this
big Mexican motherfucker.

268
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:22,563
He's holding his cock
in one hand

269
00:19:22,597 --> 00:19:23,931
and squeezing his wrist with the
other,

270
00:19:23,965 --> 00:19:25,399
trying to cut
the circulation off.

271
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,802
You know, apparently,
it feels like someone else

272
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:29,336
is jerking you fuckin' off.

273
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,572
[man 2] I think
I'll have to try that.

274
00:19:31,973 --> 00:19:34,709
[ominous music]

275
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:40,447
[voices whispering]

276
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:58,432
[fan whirring]

277
00:20:13,014 --> 00:20:15,415
[ominous music]

278
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:22,557

281
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:08,268
[chuckles]

282
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:16,376
[seagulls squawking]

283
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:21,616
The sooner we resurface
this deck,

284
00:21:23,551 --> 00:21:25,019
the sooner that Amber sets sail.

285
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,523
[suspenseful music]

286
00:21:30,024 --> 00:21:32,894
[thunder rumbles]

287

[screams]

288
00:21:45,106 --> 00:21:45,973
What?

289
00:21:49,577 --> 00:21:51,679
[ominous music]

290
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:04,992
So,

291
00:22:06,594 --> 00:22:07,929
you do still love me?

292
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:23,010
[tense music]

293
00:24:01,842 --> 00:24:03,077
Free at last.

294
00:24:03,844 --> 00:24:05,713
Free at last.

295
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,883
[Sacks whistles]

296
00:24:18,092 --> 00:24:18,926
Sacks!

297
00:24:19,794 --> 00:24:21,929
Uh, Sacks, Sacks,
excuse me, please.

298
00:24:24,065 --> 00:24:25,967
I'm so sorry,
but can I just have, um...

299
00:24:27,668 --> 00:24:29,637
can I have a sharpened pencil,
please, something that works?

300
00:24:31,706 --> 00:24:32,807
You want a pencil, huh.

301
00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:36,510
Yeah, if it's not too much
trouble, that'd be nice.

302
00:24:36,544 --> 00:24:37,011
Thank you.

303
00:24:40,648 --> 00:24:42,016
How does it feel to want?

304
00:24:44,986 --> 00:24:46,787
[tense music]

305
00:25:01,135 --> 00:25:02,903
[Harlow] <i>If you keep letting
them treat you like a bitch,</i>

306
00:25:03,871 --> 00:25:05,506
I'm gonna have to
take care of myself.

307
00:25:08,209 --> 00:25:10,277
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

308
00:25:14,882 --> 00:25:17,051
[tense music]

309
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:21,055
All right, all right.

Go thank your friend, Harlow.

I want you so bad right here.

00:26:08,803 --> 00:26:09,637
No.

327
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,237
Right now.

328
00:26:10,271 --> 00:26:11,238
I'm sweating.

329
00:26:11,272 --> 00:26:11,939
Right now, I don't care
that you're sweating.

330
00:26:11,972 --> 00:26:14,308
Besides, people are gonna see.

331
00:26:14,341 --> 00:26:15,609
I don't care who sees.

No, you can wait.

for putting me to work.

up and offed themselves

is keep us here.

00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:09,883
[Amber] Yeah, whoever it is
can wait.

360
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,131
Who was it?

361
00:29:26,834 --> 00:29:27,501
My mother.

362
00:29:29,103 --> 00:29:31,472
I told her not to call me
this weekend.

363
00:29:34,275 --> 00:29:35,142
What does she want?

364
00:29:36,578 --> 00:29:37,444
[Amber exhales]

365
00:29:39,013 --> 00:29:39,547
Mm.

366
00:29:43,618 --> 00:29:44,885
I'll call her later.

367
00:29:48,222 --> 00:29:48,989
You sure? You can just,

368
00:29:49,023 --> 00:29:50,324
you can call her now
if you want.

369
00:29:51,225 --> 00:29:53,460
[tense music]

370
00:30:00,901 --> 00:30:01,569
What did she want?

371
00:30:05,306 --> 00:30:07,241
[seagulls squawking]

372
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,943
- What did she text you?
- Nothing.

373
00:30:11,912 --> 00:30:12,580
Nothing.

374
00:30:15,115 --> 00:30:16,116
Show me the text.

375
00:30:20,921 --> 00:30:22,323
I want you to show me
the message right now.

376
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:25,859
[Sacks]
<i>How does it feel to want?</i>

377
00:30:27,595 --> 00:30:28,262
[Amber gasps]

00:30:30,565 --> 00:30:32,567
[alarm blares]

379
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:43,043
[Zeke] No.

380
00:30:43,511 --> 00:30:44,345
It can't be.

381
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,147
[breathing heavily]
I've seen your face.

382
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:47,881
[man] What?

383
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:51,018
[man]
You had a face like an angel's.

384
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:53,621
What happened
to your beautiful face?

385
00:30:53,655 --> 00:30:56,390
[man] Who the hell
are you talking to, Zeke?

386
00:30:57,925 --> 00:30:59,259
[Zeke] Oh, Goddammit!

387
00:30:59,293 --> 00:31:01,128
Stop! Stop looking at me!

388
00:31:02,096 --> 00:31:06,900
Get away from me! [sobs]

389
00:31:06,934 --> 00:31:08,969
[screaming]

00:31:09,002 --> 00:31:10,538
[suspenseful music]

391
00:31:12,072 --> 00:31:13,107
- [man] Help!
- [electricity buzzing]

392
00:31:13,474 --> 00:31:14,542
Call the warden.

393
00:31:14,975 --> 00:31:18,078
[indistinct shouting]

394
00:31:22,483 --> 00:31:23,217
[Zeke] What?

395
00:31:24,184 --> 00:31:25,285
[man] Goddammit, Zeke,
what have you done?

396
00:31:25,687 --> 00:31:27,421
[Zeke] What is happening?

397
00:31:30,391 --> 00:31:32,993
[Zeke screams]

398
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:38,399
Ezekiel!

399
00:31:40,501 --> 00:31:41,402
Zeke!

400
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:42,637
What happened, man?

401
00:31:49,209 --> 00:31:50,110
Hello?

402
00:31:50,144 --> 00:31:51,646
[tense music]

403
00:31:59,353 --> 00:32:01,054
[somber music]

404
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:25,212
[Harlow] <i>Judge McCabe,
please accept my apology</i>

405
00:32:25,245 --> 00:32:27,715
<i>for the time it's taken
to draft my personal statement</i>

406
00:32:27,749 --> 00:32:29,283

00:32:30,184 --> 00:32:32,019

00:32:38,325 --> 00:32:42,530
Hey, Ezekiel! [laughs]

411
00:32:43,665 --> 00:32:45,466
Sacks!

412
00:32:45,499 --> 00:32:48,268
Can I just get just
like a little bit more food?

413
00:32:53,173 --> 00:32:54,241

[pencil snaps]

415
00:32:56,578 --> 00:32:57,579
I demand

416
00:32:58,212 --> 00:33:00,180
a new pencil.

417
00:33:00,214 --> 00:33:01,381
How long you been up, Harlow?

418
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:04,218
You can't stop me
from filing my appeal.

419
00:33:08,523 --> 00:33:10,525
I want my pencil.

420
00:33:11,358 --> 00:33:12,660
[Sacks] You don't look so good.

421
00:33:14,261 --> 00:33:15,530
Maybe you oughta just...

422
00:33:17,264 --> 00:33:18,265
lie down.

423
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:20,367
Go to sleep.

424
00:33:21,068 --> 00:33:22,236
I want a pencil.

425
00:33:23,671 --> 00:33:24,471
Now.

426
00:33:29,276 --> 00:33:30,143
Hmm.

427
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:32,780
Maybe tomorrow.

[rumbling]

434
00:34:06,581 --> 00:34:09,817
Rule number one,
don't let nobody,

435
00:34:10,284 --> 00:34:12,319
nobody disrespect you
up in here.

436
00:34:14,154 --> 00:34:15,690
They don't know
what you're capable of,

437
00:34:17,157 --> 00:34:17,825
but I do.

438
00:34:21,194 --> 00:34:24,064
My nigga! [laughs]

[chuckles]

441
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:58,432
[chuckles] I think today
is my birthday.

442
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:12,580
Hey, yo, Zeke.

443
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:16,718
Ezekiel!

444
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:20,420

Is this your doing, Zeke?

445
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,885
[distorted voice] Harlow.

446
00:35:53,921 --> 00:35:57,157
Use the ink
that's flowing in your veins.

447
00:35:57,692 --> 00:35:58,926
Yo, Zeke, is that you?

448
00:35:59,661 --> 00:36:00,795
[chuckles]

449
00:36:02,597 --> 00:36:03,564
Man, man.

450
00:36:05,298 --> 00:36:07,434
You gonna leave me over here
alone like this, man?

451
00:36:54,015 --> 00:36:55,750
Not bad, not bad.

00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,877
[ominous music]

453
00:37:24,645 --> 00:37:26,547
[Harlow] <i>Judge McCabe,
I intend to prove</i>

454
00:37:26,581 --> 00:37:29,617
<i>that unfair racial profiling
led to my arrest,</i>

455
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,852
<i>and the selection of a jury</i>

456
00:37:30,885 --> 00:37:33,654
<i>with preconceived notions
about my character.</i>

457
00:37:37,558 --> 00:37:40,928
<i>Requestioning key witnesses
will prove this theory.</i>

458
00:37:45,633 --> 00:37:48,335
<i>You should also know
there's a corrections officer</i>

459
00:37:48,368 --> 00:37:51,038
<i>here in the SHU
determined to silence me</i>

460
00:37:52,073 --> 00:37:53,608
<i>by any means necessary.</i>

461
00:38:03,718 --> 00:38:04,952
I just wanted to talk to my mom.

462
00:38:04,986 --> 00:38:06,954
I don't think there's anything
wrong with that.

463
00:38:06,988 --> 00:38:07,989
It's not gonna work like this.

464
00:38:08,689 --> 00:38:10,423
You are a control freak.

465
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:12,693
You still don't get that
you brought this on yourself.

466
00:38:12,727 --> 00:38:14,427
Things were like this
before the affair.

467
00:38:15,596 --> 00:38:18,933
Everything I say to you,
you end up using it against me.

468
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:21,702
You're constantly
looking over my shoulder

469
00:38:21,736 --> 00:38:24,071
and second-guessing
everything I do.

470
00:38:24,105 --> 00:38:25,372
What do you want?

471
00:38:25,405 --> 00:38:27,008
[tense music]

472
00:38:28,142 --> 00:38:29,076
I don't want anything.

473
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:29,944
You don't want anything?

474
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:31,311
Then fuck off then!

475
00:38:32,713 --> 00:38:34,314
Why did you bring me here?

476
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:37,785
Do you have any idea what
kind of man they'll think I am?

477
00:38:37,819 --> 00:38:39,587
I don't wanna be
analyzed by you.

478
00:38:39,787 --> 00:38:40,688
I just needed to talk.

479
00:38:41,923 --> 00:38:43,825
There's nothing wrong with me
talking to my own mother.

480
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:45,560
You don't think that
she's gonna tell him?

481
00:38:45,593 --> 00:38:46,828
What do you care
what my father...

482
00:38:46,861 --> 00:38:47,595
Because!

483
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,898
He gave me the money to start
my fucking practice, Amber!

484
00:38:50,932 --> 00:38:51,999
So this is about money.

485
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,702
This is about me
not having to defend my choice

486
00:38:54,735 --> 00:38:55,736
not to leave you!

487
00:38:56,571 --> 00:38:57,939
I'm gonna make this
easy for you.

488
00:38:59,874 --> 00:39:00,608
Hey.

489
00:39:02,409 --> 00:39:03,945
[roaring]

490
00:39:05,478 --> 00:39:06,781
- [Sacks] To the window!
- [banging on door]

491
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:15,556
When we call you to the window,
you get up and move.

492
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:18,860
Get dressed.

493
00:39:31,038 --> 00:39:31,906
Mr. Reid.

494
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:35,776
I have good news for you.

495
00:39:36,878 --> 00:39:39,547
Your time in the segregated
housing unit is up.

496
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:43,885
I trust you're ready
to try again

497
00:39:43,918 --> 00:39:45,820
back in the general population.

498
00:39:46,954 --> 00:39:47,889
God, yes.

499
00:39:48,756 --> 00:39:49,624
Thank you.

500
00:39:50,892 --> 00:39:52,526
Thank God indeed.

501
00:39:55,863 --> 00:39:59,133
You'll have to spend a few weeks
in the step down unit.

502
00:40:03,738 --> 00:40:04,505
Good luck.

503
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,475
Prepare the prisoner's
personal items.

504
00:40:09,143 --> 00:40:10,011
[guard] Yes, sir.

505
00:40:10,745 --> 00:40:11,746
[warden] Officer Sacks.

506
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:16,918
[Harlow] Thank you.

507
00:40:17,752 --> 00:40:18,653
Thank you.

508
00:40:23,758 --> 00:40:24,759
Warden.

509
00:40:25,492 --> 00:40:26,627
[warden] What is it, Mr. Reid?

510
00:40:28,162 --> 00:40:29,429
What happened to Zeke?

511
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:30,698
Zeke.

512
00:40:32,767 --> 00:40:35,770
If I were you, I wouldn't
concern myself with him.

513
00:40:40,775 --> 00:40:41,642
Come on.

00:40:45,146 --> 00:40:47,214

- [buzzer blares]

Face the bars, prisoner.

- [gate rattling]
- [buzzers blares]

521
00:41:49,043 --> 00:41:50,011
You know, if...

522
00:41:51,112 --> 00:41:52,613
if things were different,

523
00:41:54,782 --> 00:41:56,617
I might actually have been able
to help you.

524
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,821
Huh/

525
00:42:01,922 --> 00:42:03,624
Too bad there's not
a couch in here, huh, Harlow?

526
00:42:03,924 --> 00:42:04,625
[elevator dings]

527
00:42:05,726 --> 00:42:06,260
Go on.

528
00:42:15,603 --> 00:42:17,905
I hope whoever cut you
got what they deserved.

529
00:42:20,741 --> 00:42:21,609
Two years.

530
00:42:22,943 --> 00:42:24,045
Two years in the SHU

531
00:42:24,078 --> 00:42:25,746
plus the time
he'd already served.

532
00:42:27,348 --> 00:42:29,250
And every night, I go home,
look in the mirror,

533
00:42:29,283 --> 00:42:30,651
and think to myself

534
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:35,022
if today that sorry excuse
for a human being

535
00:42:35,056 --> 00:42:39,093
just happened to,
you know, stop breathing,

536
00:42:41,328 --> 00:42:43,798
I'd be doing the world
a huge favor.

537
00:42:47,735 --> 00:42:48,969
[ominous music]

538
00:42:49,003 --> 00:42:51,305
And every day, I decided
I was better than that,

539
00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:53,908
so I did nothing.

540
00:42:56,644 --> 00:42:57,878
You did the right thing.

541
00:42:58,179 --> 00:42:58,913
[Sacks scoffs]

542
00:43:03,851 --> 00:43:04,785
Piece of shit.

543
00:43:05,853 --> 00:43:07,688
Eventually got out on parole.

544
00:43:10,391 --> 00:43:13,661
Within a few months, he was
back to his lowlife ways,

545
00:43:13,694 --> 00:43:15,763
driving around
with a truck full of drugs.

546
00:43:15,796 --> 00:43:17,932
Cops pursued him
for almost 26 miles.

547
00:43:20,067 --> 00:43:21,802
Finally, he lost control.

548
00:43:27,374 --> 00:43:29,844
[elevator dinging]

549
00:43:33,447 --> 00:43:35,649
He plowed into
a 13-year-old girl

550
00:43:35,683 --> 00:43:37,151
waiting for a school bus.

551
00:43:38,185 --> 00:43:40,654
[music continues]

552
00:43:40,688 --> 00:43:41,856
That's when I knew,

553
00:43:47,461 --> 00:43:48,929
people like him...

557
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:05,045
don't deserve second chances.

[dramatic music]

559
00:44:13,287 --> 00:44:16,290
You will be back in the SHU,
Harlow.

560
00:44:20,427 --> 00:44:22,329
And you'll do the dirty work
for me,

561
00:44:26,433 --> 00:44:27,334
just like...

562
00:44:29,203 --> 00:44:30,070
the guy...

563
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,441
who gave me this.

564
00:44:38,045 --> 00:44:41,682
I can't wait to see you
swinging from your bed sheet.

565
00:44:45,219 --> 00:44:46,086
For me,

566
00:44:48,455 --> 00:44:50,057
that's justice enough.

567
00:44:51,892 --> 00:44:52,459
[elevator dings]

[guard] On your knees,
convict, now!

578
00:46:30,057 --> 00:46:30,991
Don't move!

585
00:47:10,064 --> 00:47:11,231
- What did she text you?
- Nothing.

586
00:47:13,334 --> 00:47:14,201
Nothing.

587
00:47:16,538 --> 00:47:17,471
Show me the text.

588
00:47:18,472 --> 00:47:19,473
I want you to show me
the message right now.

589
00:47:19,507 --> 00:47:20,508
[intense music]

590
00:47:23,277 --> 00:47:24,311
[Amber] I needed to talk.

591
00:47:24,345 --> 00:47:25,479
<i>I needed to talk to my mom</i>

592
00:47:25,513 --> 00:47:26,614
and there's nothing wrong
with that.

593
00:47:26,648 --> 00:47:28,482
And every time
I try to talk to you,

594
00:47:28,516 --> 00:47:30,150
you end up using
everything against me.

595
00:47:30,384 --> 00:47:31,285
You're looking over my shoulder

596
00:47:31,318 --> 00:47:33,220
and you're second-guessing
everything I do.

597
00:47:33,253 --> 00:47:34,556
And it's not gonna work
like this.

598
00:47:34,589 --> 00:47:36,090
No, you're right,
it's not gonna work this way

599
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:37,991
'cause you still don't get...

600
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,461
that you brought this
on yourself.

Help!

You just earned yourself
another 90 days, prisoner.

No!

617

- Get up.
- No!

- No!
- Go get yourself cleaned up.

Pull back, prisoner!

You go ahead and get cleaned up.

624

I got this.
I'll take care of the trays.

Fine.

I'll be right back.

If you're gonna act
like an animal,

I'm gonna treat you
like an animal.

Please.

00:49:37,478 --> 00:49:38,378
Eat up, Harlow.

00:49:47,454 --> 00:49:48,989

[Sacks laughs]

658
00:53:29,476 --> 00:53:31,512
You're trying to bait me into
being the kind of man

659
00:53:31,546 --> 00:53:32,747
that you think that you deserve.

660
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:35,516
When I spoke to my mother,
it was in a moment of weakness.

661
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:36,984
You don't get to call it
a moment of weakness

662
00:53:37,018 --> 00:53:39,286
when you can't get through
an entire day

663

There's nothing wrong with me.

You don't like the way
that you feel without them.

667
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:51,264
The issue
will not resolve itself, Amber.

668
00:53:51,298 --> 00:53:54,969
The issue is that I don't like
the way you treat me.

669
00:53:57,071 --> 00:53:57,839
Stop!

670
00:53:58,305 --> 00:53:59,439

No, I'm not.

You got this, motherfucker.

686
00:54:50,858 --> 00:54:51,993
Come on, Harlow.

687
00:54:54,662 --> 00:54:55,730
Man the fuck up!

688
00:54:56,764 --> 00:54:58,833
We gonna be in here
for the rest of our lives.

689
00:54:58,866 --> 00:55:01,068
Better get used to this.
[laughs]

690
00:55:02,737 --> 00:55:04,605
You part of the statistic now.

691
00:55:05,438 --> 00:55:08,009
One in three, that's your ass.

692
00:55:08,876 --> 00:55:09,811
Plus my ass.

693
00:55:09,844 --> 00:55:14,882
That's two, 2.3 million
motherfuckers in jail,

694
00:55:14,916 --> 00:55:16,050
behind bars!

695
00:55:16,584 --> 00:55:17,685
You're one of 'em.

696
00:55:17,718 --> 00:55:18,753
You a slave.

697
00:55:18,786 --> 00:55:20,555
They took away the chains,
put them shits back on

698
00:55:20,822 --> 00:55:21,923
'cause you fucked up!

699
00:55:21,956 --> 00:55:22,723
No.

700
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:23,925
This is your fault.

701
00:55:24,792 --> 00:55:26,661
It was an accident
and you know that.

702
00:55:26,694 --> 00:55:27,562
You,

703
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:29,730
you bad.

704
00:55:31,532 --> 00:55:32,399
You know.

705
00:55:33,601 --> 00:55:34,101
No.

706
00:55:35,102 --> 00:55:35,970
You know.

00:55:38,673 --> 00:55:39,472
You know.

[Zeke]

709
00:55:41,809 --> 00:55:43,511

Zeke?

713
00:56:00,027 --> 00:56:01,394
Talk to me, Zeke.

714
00:56:03,164 --> 00:56:04,599
You're all that I have.

715
00:56:04,999 --> 00:56:05,733
What?

716
00:56:08,736 --> 00:56:09,937
I didn't do it.

717
00:56:11,005 --> 00:56:12,006
I didn't do it.

718
00:56:12,506 --> 00:56:13,741
I didn't do it.

719
00:56:15,943 --> 00:56:17,945
No, I didn't...

720
00:56:20,815 --> 00:56:21,883
What's happening to me?

721
00:56:22,183 --> 00:56:24,151
[music continues]

722
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:30,490
[whispering]
Did I fucking do it?

723
00:56:37,031 --> 00:56:38,465
