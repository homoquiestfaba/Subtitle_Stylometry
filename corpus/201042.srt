00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:57,211
Something real happy, right?

343
00:40:57,285 --> 00:40:59,845
Come on, Sean.
I'll take you home.

344
00:40:59,921 --> 00:41:01,582
So how do I look?

345
00:41:01,656 --> 00:41:04,716
Do I look like
I'm gonna be a good gas pumper, huh?

346
00:41:05,393 --> 00:41:09,261
'Course, I'm gonna have to get myself
a tattoo, right? And a big scar.

347
00:41:09,331 --> 00:41:13,165
'Cause if I'm gonna be the new town freak,
I gotta do it all the way, correct?

348
00:41:13,234 --> 00:41:15,395
<i>(bell rings)</i>

349
00:41:16,638 --> 00:41:19,334
- Hear that?
<i>- (bell rings)</i>

350
00:41:21,643 --> 00:41:23,338
So what do you think, man?

351
00:41:23,411 --> 00:41:27,313
Do you think I got what it takes? Huh?
Do I got what it takes?

352
00:41:27,382 --> 00:41:30,146
Are people gonna come through here
and ring my bell?

353
00:41:30,218 --> 00:41:33,710
Huh? Are they gonna ring my bell?
You think they'll come through?

354
00:41:33,788 --> 00:41:36,780
- Don't do this, man.
- Don't do what?

355
00:41:36,858 --> 00:41:40,988
Yeah, don't worry, Dad.
I'll make you real fucking proud.

356
00:41:42,297 --> 00:41:45,698
Sean! Sean, come on, man!

357
00:41:46,968 --> 00:41:49,801
Sean, stop it!

358
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,703
- Get the fuck off me!
- Come on.

359
00:42:14,896 --> 00:42:17,057
<i>(Sean)</i> Oh, shit!

360
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,894
<i>(coughs/vomits)</i>

361
00:42:48,596 --> 00:42:51,565
This is some weird shit.

362
00:42:51,633 --> 00:42:53,897
I don't like it.

363
00:43:03,878 --> 00:43:06,972
When did Ray's body go missing?

364
00:43:07,048 --> 00:43:12,714
I don't know, but I think I saw
his truck this morning at the cemetery.

365
00:43:20,095 --> 00:43:23,121
Who else is missing?

366
00:43:23,198 --> 00:43:25,496
Terry who works at the morgue...

367
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:28,559
and Deputy Turner.

368
00:43:28,636 --> 00:43:31,036
What's going on, Cece?

369
00:43:43,318 --> 00:43:45,878
It's a voodoo temple.

370
00:43:45,954 --> 00:43:50,391
Grandma was a mambo,
like her mother before her.

371
00:43:52,861 --> 00:43:55,261
It's in our blood, Eden.

372
00:43:59,167 --> 00:44:04,366
For generations,
people would come here to worship.

373
00:44:04,439 --> 00:44:08,034
It's a religion, like any other.

374
00:44:08,109 --> 00:44:11,601
It's full of spirits - both good and evil.

375
00:44:14,849 --> 00:44:17,044
They're called loas.

376
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,518
Grandma helped a lot of people here.

377
00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:23,648
She was a good woman.

378
00:44:25,026 --> 00:44:27,961
Your grandmother was wearing this.

379
00:44:30,799 --> 00:44:33,324
It's a baka.

380
00:44:33,802 --> 00:44:36,464
It's a charm that protects against evil.

381
00:44:38,706 --> 00:44:41,971
What was she doing
out so late last night?

382
00:44:43,511 --> 00:44:48,244
You know over in Cypress,
where they're building that new mill?

383
00:44:48,316 --> 00:44:51,513
There's an old Creole burial ground there.

384
00:44:51,586 --> 00:44:54,953
She was afraid of what
someone might find if they started digging.

385
00:44:55,023 --> 00:44:57,253
The suitcase?

386
00:44:59,761 --> 00:45:02,127
Grandma saved souls.

387
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:06,759
Murderers,

388
00:45:06,835 --> 00:45:09,395
sadists,

389
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:11,802
the most vile men.

390
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:16,139
She milked them of evil.

391
00:45:17,045 --> 00:45:18,979
What was in that suitcase, Cece?

392
00:45:19,047 --> 00:45:23,347
Every soul that she ever milked...

393
00:45:23,418 --> 00:45:25,318
was inside that suitcase.

394
00:45:26,154 --> 00:45:29,783
So if those snakes got set free
and if they killed Ray,

395
00:45:29,858 --> 00:45:34,795
the evil of countless souls
is inside of him right now...

396
00:45:35,864 --> 00:45:39,061
possessing his body.

397
00:45:39,133 --> 00:45:42,296
You're really
starting to scare me, Cece.

398
00:45:43,171 --> 00:45:47,232
You said it yourself.
You saw his truck outside the cemetery.

399
00:45:47,308 --> 00:45:52,336
Now his only instinct will be to kill
and to sacrifice to the dark loas.

400
00:45:52,413 --> 00:45:55,473
Nobody's safe, Eden.

401
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:57,415
Nobody's safe.

402
00:46:00,955 --> 00:46:03,423
Should we go now?

403
00:46:03,491 --> 00:46:07,860
She's really out of it. I mean, she's saying
some weird stuff. I think she needs help.

404
00:46:07,929 --> 00:46:11,456
- What's wrong?
- I don't know, but there's no phone here.

405
00:46:11,532 --> 00:46:15,696
- Do you have your cell?
- Like we're gonna have reception here?

406
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:19,262
Listen. You guys need to go to my house,
get my mom and bring her here.

407
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,672
Call the sheriff.
Make sure he gets here too.

408
00:46:21,743 --> 00:46:24,143
What is going on, Eden?

409
00:46:24,212 --> 00:46:26,578
I don't know, OK?
Just hurry.

410
00:46:26,648 --> 00:46:28,912
I'll stay with Cece.

411
00:46:28,983 --> 00:46:30,746
Let's go.

412
00:46:30,985 --> 00:46:32,816
Let's go.

413
00:46:43,298 --> 00:46:47,359
- I sent Rachel and Ricky for help.
- You should've gone too.

414
00:46:47,435 --> 00:46:49,767
Grandma's dead.

415
00:46:49,837 --> 00:46:54,274
I'm the only descendant left.
Ray Sawyer will come here.

416
00:46:54,342 --> 00:46:58,802
He'll want me dead,
and he will kill anyone in his path.

417
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,179
- You need help, Cece.
- There is no help.

418
00:47:03,785 --> 00:47:08,484
You saw Ray at the cemetery because
he needs a sacred place to worship.

419
00:47:08,556 --> 00:47:14,620
Reaping the souls of all that he kills
is his only purpose now.

420
00:47:15,163 --> 00:47:17,188
And he won't stop.

421
00:47:21,769 --> 00:47:23,703
<i>(tinkling)</i>

422
00:47:24,772 --> 00:47:27,707

- What?

<i>(birds fluttering)</i>

424
00:47:34,148 --> 00:47:35,945
It's nothing.

00:47:36,017 --> 00:47:38,417
Come on, come on.

426
00:47:43,257 --> 00:47:45,657
What the fuck?

427
00:47:48,162 --> 00:47:51,563
My fucking car!
I can't believe this.

428
00:47:56,004 --> 00:48:01,203
- That's what the bottom of a car looks like.
- I don't think that's funny.

429
00:48:06,814 --> 00:48:09,749
Is that Ray's truck?

430
00:48:15,356 --> 00:48:16,880
<i>(crack)</i>

431

Aaaargh! Aaaargh!

- No. We have to stay here. It's safe here.

455
00:50:09,237 --> 00:50:11,296
- No, it's not safe here!
- Yes, it is!

456
00:50:11,372 --> 00:50:13,499
The house is spelled.
He can't come in.

457
00:50:13,574 --> 00:50:17,840
- Oh, God! Ricky.
- Rachel, it's gonna be OK.

458
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:27,282
What the hell is he doing?

459
00:50:48,543 --> 00:50:51,512
How... how can he be alive?

460
00:50:51,579 --> 00:50:55,140
We need a gun.
Did your grandmother have a gun?

461
00:50:55,216 --> 00:50:57,741
- It won't help.
- Where's the fucking gun?

462
00:50:57,818 --> 00:51:00,844
I don't know.
The bedroom.

463
00:51:04,058 --> 00:51:06,390
Rachel.

464
00:51:06,894 --> 00:51:08,122
We're safe here.

465
00:51:08,196 --> 00:51:11,029
You're kidding, right?
Did you see that fucking thing?

466
00:51:11,098 --> 00:51:13,498
This house has been blessed.

467
00:51:13,568 --> 00:51:17,334
- It's protected against evil.
- Fucking great.

468
00:51:17,405 --> 00:51:21,341
I'm glad your grandma hexed the house
when she should have installed a phone.

It's OK. We're safe in here.
We're safe, right?

479
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,800
The altar room will be safest.

480

- That thing can't be Ray.
- It's Ray, Sean.

Yeah, but Ray's dead.

00:55:43,304 --> 00:55:47,900
You know this voodoo stuff. Can't you, like,
demilk him with a ritual or something?

516
00:55:47,975 --> 00:55:49,875
That's real mambo work.

517
00:55:49,944 --> 00:55:53,880
I only know the little things,
like dolls and spells and...

518
00:55:54,982 --> 00:55:58,042
I can't.

520
00:56:04,558 --> 00:56:06,890

521
00:56:07,995 --> 00:56:11,829
- I can make a doll.
- A doll? What would that do?

522
00:56:11,899 --> 00:56:15,460
The evil is inside Ray's body.
I can't stop that.

523
00:56:15,536 --> 00:56:19,529
But maybe I can stop his body
long enough for us to get out of here.

524
00:56:19,607 --> 00:56:23,043
- It's worth a try.
- Are you talking about a voodoo doll?

525
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:27,206
If I had something of Ray's,
like some hair or some clothing,

526
00:56:27,281 --> 00:56:30,273
some actual part of him,
I could make a doll...

527
00:56:30,351 --> 00:56:34,344
So who's gonna go outside
and pull a lock of hair?

528
00:56:38,659 --> 00:56:41,628
- Will blood work?
- What are you talking about?

529
00:56:41,695 --> 00:56:44,823
Sean's his son.
Ray's blood is running through him.

530
00:56:44,899 --> 00:56:47,390
That would work, right?

531
00:56:48,469 --> 00:56:49,527
Blood works best.

532
00:56:49,603 --> 00:56:53,835
Eden, what the fuck are you talking about?
You can't be serious.

533
00:56:57,311 --> 00:56:59,871
What do we have to do?

534
00:57:00,948 --> 00:57:03,473
Help me move his body
into the altar room.

535
00:57:03,551 --> 00:57:06,315
- What are you doing?!
- Trying to get us out of here.

536
00:57:06,387 --> 00:57:09,515
By doing what?!
Making a human voodoo doll?

537
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:13,117
- Eden, we can't do this.
- He's dead, OK?

538
00:57:13,193 --> 00:57:15,991
- We will be too if we don't do something.
- It's wrong.

539
00:57:16,063 --> 00:57:19,658
What part of that thing
did you guys not see out there?

540
00:57:19,733 --> 00:57:22,167
I won't let you.

541
00:57:22,236 --> 00:57:24,966
If there's a chance that this can work...

542
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,201

546
00:57:57,671 --> 00:58:02,301
Take this oil,
rub it on the temple of his forehead.

547
00:58:02,376 --> 00:58:04,867
Sprinkle this around his hands and feet.

548
00:58:04,945 --> 00:58:08,938
- What is it?
- Kempelan. It's blessing powder.

549
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:18,989
Go to the altar, and light all

554
00:59:21,955 --> 00:59:24,651
