          (air hisses)

        (gasping)

    (big band music playing

    (knocking on door)          

26
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:02,494
        Who is it?              

27
00:06:03,562 --> 00:06:04,996
                            MAN:
                    Mr. Cook?   

28
00:06:05,063 --> 00:06:06,498
    Yeah. Who are you?          

29
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:08,800
                  A war buddy of
                 Jack Marshak's.

30
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,167
              Oh.               

31
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,171
                  May I come in?

32
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:15,473
          Hell, yeah.           

33
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:19,043
    Any friend of Marshak's     
is welcome in this house.       

34
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:20,812
Would you like a cold one?      

35
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:23,114
                  No, thank you.

36
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:25,249
    Where did you know Jack?    

37
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:27,418
          Oh, we spent some time
            together at Belburg.

38
00:06:27,486 --> 00:06:29,153
Oh, "Hell's Toilet." Yeah.      

39
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:31,222
     I was one of the guys      
    liberated it, you know.     

40
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:35,026
Yeah. I know.                   

41
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:38,730
You don't look old enough       
    to be a WWII vet.           

42
00:06:38,797 --> 00:06:41,198
Let's just say                  
I've been well-preserved.       

43
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:42,867
Is this your unit?              

44
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,869
                     Yeah. Yeah.

45
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,505
                 Seven guys from
                 five countries.

46
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,008
                Crack commandos.

47
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:53,011
                We captured this
                 Nazi scientist.

48
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:55,846
                    He was doing
            experiments on POWs.

49
00:06:55,914 --> 00:06:57,381
Horst Mueller.                  

50
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:00,985
    Ah, we should have killed   
              that evil bastard.

51
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:05,389
    Guys like that don't deserve
        to live, even in prison.

52
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:07,358
                That's me there.

53
00:07:07,425 --> 00:07:10,227
        The good-looking one.   

54
00:07:10,295 --> 00:07:13,097
                Bet you can't   
            pick out Marshak.   

55
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,634
                That's right.   

56
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,403
          That's him.           

57
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,071
    You know he got a medal     
          that night?           

58
00:07:20,138 --> 00:07:21,706
Really?                         
             Yeah.              

59
00:07:21,773 --> 00:07:27,311
      That's me and Shaw,       
     Caruthers, Ivanovitch,     

60
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:32,250
  Simpson and Frenchy Leroux.   

61
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,185
      Not many of us left.      

62
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,522
            No, there aren't.   

63
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:43,460
(choking gasps)                 

64
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:47,198
        (raspy gasping)         

65
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:51,335
         (sharp crack)          

66
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,441
    (speaking German):          

67
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:02,413
    (cuckoo clock sounding)     

68
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:12,523
(bell clanks, door closes)      

69
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:16,794
Reporting for duty,             
Captain Marshak.                

70
00:08:18,964 --> 00:08:20,798
                     Present and
             accounted for, sir.

71
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,334
             Shaw.              

72
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:25,403
            Simpson.            

73
00:08:30,642 --> 00:08:33,477
You old bastard.                

74
00:08:33,545 --> 00:08:36,246
        (laughing)              

75
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,382
                     It's been a
                lot of years.   

76
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,688
Been a long time, Captain.      

77
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,425
We should be meeting            
under better circumstances.     

78
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,328
You ready for the funeral?      

79
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,531
                I'm not going.  

80
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:57,868
                    Why not?    

81
00:08:57,903 --> 00:09:00,071
        I just don't want to.   

82
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:03,507
Jack, when we shot our way      
         into Belburg,          

83
00:09:03,575 --> 00:09:05,843
    it was Lefty led us in.     

84
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:07,311
If it wasn't for him...         

85
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:09,580
              Look, I don't want
            to go, all right?   

86
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:12,249
Jack, you got to.               
                        Why?    

87
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,919
     What good is it going to do
     seeing Lefty in his coffin?

88
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,788
Jack, we're getting old.        

89
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:19,857
All we can do                   
for each other now              

90
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:22,526
is to see that                  
we get buried right.            

91
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:36,206
        Here's to you, Lefty.   

92
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:47,284
    What's that stuff,          
         lighter fluid?         

93
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:48,919
          It's the same stuff we
        drank in the foxhole.   

94
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,354
        You going soft on me?   

95
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:52,290
Why would anyone                
kill Lefty?                     

96
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,925
         Or Caruthers.          

97
00:09:53,992 --> 00:09:55,092
Caruthers?                      

98
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,428
                  Yeah, somebody
              murdered him, too.

99
00:09:57,495 --> 00:09:58,629
    How?                        

100
00:09:58,697 --> 00:10:00,131
                I don't know.   

101
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:12,643
Jack, what                      
are you doing?                  

102
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:16,514
                    My God. Look
                  at this wound.

103
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:17,948
Jack,       He's been strangled.

104
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:19,950
        for God's sake.         

105
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:41,939
        MAN (on radio):         
No, you can't, my friend,       
but you can't be bullied either.

106
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:44,908
Maybe, if we made an example of 
one of these tin-pot dictators, 

107
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:46,944
took his country away from him, 

108
00:10:47,012 --> 00:10:49,647
  people might not be so quick  
    to make trouble for us.     

109
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,381
    What a jerk.                

110
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:52,950
        Makes you wonder        
why we fought the big one.      

111
00:10:53,018 --> 00:10:55,285
          Hmm. Kind of makes you
             think, though. Hmm.

112
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:56,487
      Hey, I'm not saying       
        we should go in         

113
00:10:56,554 --> 00:10:58,188
and blow these little countries 
          off the map,          

114
00:10:58,256 --> 00:10:59,456
  but we sure as hell deserve   

115
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:01,792
    a lot more respect          
      than we're getting.       

116
00:11:01,859 --> 00:11:03,828
    (radio continues playing    
         indistinctly)          

117
00:11:03,895 --> 00:11:05,696
Come on, Jack.                  
Let's do some drinking.         

118
00:11:05,763 --> 00:11:07,632
This is supposed                
to be a wake.                   

119
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:17,875
          Didn't Lefty have a 20
        game season in Triple A?

120
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:23,047
Only problem is,                
it was three and 17.            

121
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,448
      To hear him tell it,      

122
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:26,951
    he would have made          
the world forget Cy Young.      

123
00:11:30,055 --> 00:11:33,490
            I just called the   
        Veterans Administration.

124
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:37,361
        Ivanovitch and Leroux   
            are dead as well.   

125
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:42,032
         I want to know         
  if they were murdered, too.   

126
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,602
    Barbed wire is how          
      the Butcher killed.       

127
00:11:50,742 --> 00:11:53,778
Jack, the Butcher is dead.      

128
00:11:53,845 --> 00:11:56,547
  I dreamt about him the night  
that Lefty was strangled.       

129
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:57,748
      A week hasn't passed      

130
00:11:57,816 --> 00:11:59,750
     where I haven't had a      
    nightmare about the war.    

131
00:11:59,818 --> 00:12:02,520
         This was real.         

132
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,957
 I was back there about to die. 

133
00:12:19,971 --> 00:12:23,507
          (loud thud)           
             JACK:              
        Oh, God...              

134
00:12:27,378 --> 00:12:28,813
          Where am I sleeping?  

135
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,881
Don't be ridiculous.            
I'll be fine.                   

136
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:33,050
            You need a friend   
            around you, Marshak.

137
00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:34,651
          I can stay a few days.

138
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,187
Shaw...                         

139
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:41,092
 Look, you're not getting rid of
  me until you shake this thing.

140
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:43,828
Micki and Ryan                  
are out of town.                

141
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:47,098
So take Micki's room, it's      
at the head of the stairs.      

142
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:50,134
                Don't be so damn
                morose, Jack.   

143
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:52,603
            We all die sometime.

144
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,539
We don't all get                
murdered, do we?                

145
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:58,675
        Let's get some shut-eye.

146
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:03,580
          A few days with me and
     you'll be out of the dumps.

147
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:09,253
Shaw, thanks.                   

148
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,455
        I hope you still feel   
        the same way tomorrow   

149
00:13:11,522 --> 00:13:14,158
    because you're gonna have   
        a hell of a hangover.   

150
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,293
                      (chuckles)

151
00:13:26,571 --> 00:13:29,206
(whistling "Lili Marlene")      

152
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,828
        Simpson...              

153
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,267
    (chains rattling)           

154
00:14:02,707 --> 00:14:03,874
    (speaking German):          

155
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,717
         (man groaning)         

156
00:14:13,785 --> 00:14:16,453
          (screaming)           

157
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,300
          (screaming)           

158
00:14:30,368 --> 00:14:32,903
        (gasping)               

159
00:14:32,971 --> 00:14:36,173
      (panicked screaming)      

160
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:39,009
Easy, Jack, easy.               

161
00:14:39,077 --> 00:14:41,345
    Easy.                       

162
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,547
You were screaming like         
someone was killing you.        

163
00:14:53,758 --> 00:14:55,192
              Jack Marshak, yes.

164
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,094
                  Ah, thank you.

165
00:15:00,865 --> 00:15:02,767
    (cuckoo clock sounding)     

166
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:10,674
                Who was that?   

167
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:13,076
Courier from the                
Veterans Administration.        

168
00:15:13,144 --> 00:15:15,045
Coffee's over there             
if you want it.                 

169
00:15:17,682 --> 00:15:20,250
Oh, my God.                     

170
00:15:20,318 --> 00:15:21,819
              What is it?       

171
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:26,424
Ivanovitch and Leroux were      
both murdered in Europe.        

172
00:15:26,491 --> 00:15:30,394
And they were strangled,        
just like Lefty and Caruthers.  

173
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,830
             I can't believe it.

174
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,465
        When did this happen?   

175
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,801
Within the year.                

176
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:39,102
All since I've been             
having these dreams.            

177
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,104
    Oh, snap out of it, Jack.   

178
00:15:41,172 --> 00:15:42,807
            Mueller's rotting in
                some German jail

179
00:15:42,874 --> 00:15:44,542
             and Rausch is dead.

180
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,611
I wish I could                  
believe it.                     

181
00:15:58,656 --> 00:16:02,927
    Mueller was experimenting   
         with reanimation, Shaw.

182
00:16:02,994 --> 00:16:06,130
     The bodies in that lab that
      were cryogenically frozen.

183
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,332
What are you saying?            

184
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,635
That he froze Rausch            
before we captured him?         

185
00:16:11,703 --> 00:16:13,170
                  He had time.  

186
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:14,905
Don't be ridiculous!            

187
00:16:18,343 --> 00:16:20,244
                 Stranger things
                  have happened.

188
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,847
Not in my lifetime.             

189
00:16:22,914 --> 00:16:26,783
Just listen to                  
yourself, Jack.                 

190
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,220
Nobody comes back               
from the dead.                  

191
00:16:29,287 --> 00:16:31,121
Now, I don't know               
who's doing this,               

192
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:34,325
but it's not some               
phantom from our past.          

193
00:16:36,728 --> 00:16:39,897
              MAN:              
You can't sterilize people      
 because they're mentally ill.  

194
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,899
Sterilizing people              
in mental hospitals             

195
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,000
is an American idea,            
my friend.                      

196
00:16:44,102 --> 00:16:47,337
It was very popular             
before World War II.            

197
00:16:47,405 --> 00:16:49,506
Are you suggesting to me        
that American doctors           

198
00:16:49,574 --> 00:16:52,076
would do something like         
that without giving it          
a lot of thought?               

199
00:16:52,143 --> 00:16:54,377
    Well, no, but that          
     doesn't make it right.     

200
00:16:54,445 --> 00:16:56,814
Of course they thought about it.

201
00:16:56,881 --> 00:16:58,682
    And so should you.          

202
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,250
    And while you're at it,     

203
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:02,486
why don't you think about       
     those people out there     

204
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,955
spreading sexual diseases.      

205
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,256
Maybe it would stop them.       

206
00:17:06,324 --> 00:17:08,458
     Hey, don't get me onto     
      that subject, Karl.       

207
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:10,861
     Well, I'm going to...      

208
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,796
        tomorrow night.         

209
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,934
  (lively theme music playing)  
  That's all the time we have.  

210
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:20,504
     Tomorrow, an epidemic      
  is sweeping across the land.  

211
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:22,372
A disease without a cure.       

212
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,975
      I want to know what       
      you'd do to stop it.      

213
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:30,580
  Think about it, and tomorrow  
I'll tell you my solution.      

214
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,716
     This is Karl Stiener.      

215
00:17:32,784 --> 00:17:35,186
    Thank you for listening,    
            America.            

216
00:17:40,158 --> 00:17:44,128
    You have the uncanny ability
  to make the most radical ideas

217
00:17:44,195 --> 00:17:46,963
                sound acceptable
              to the common man.

218
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:49,666
You make it sound as            
if I'm trying to deceive them.  

219
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:52,169
People aren't that stupid.      

220
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:56,340
The reason they tune me in is   
because I tell them the truth.  

221
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,875
        You've become a major   
influence over the past year,   

222
00:17:58,943 --> 00:18:01,044
         yet people seem to know
          very little about you.

223
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,746
        Tell me about your past.

224
00:18:02,814 --> 00:18:04,347
I'm much more                   
interested in the future.       

225
00:18:04,449 --> 00:18:07,517
         You're on the cover of 
           <i>Newsmaker</i> this month.

226
00:18:07,585 --> 00:18:10,620
    And they're saying that your
    days in radio are numbered--

227
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,390
                that your future
                 is in politics.

228
00:18:15,393 --> 00:18:17,494
            MUELLER:            
             <i>Rausch.</i>            

229
00:18:17,562 --> 00:18:20,364
Let's just say I intend         
to keep reaching                

230
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:24,334
the citizens of this            
country with my message.        

231
00:18:24,402 --> 00:18:26,670
    (speaking German):          

232
00:18:38,582 --> 00:18:40,818
You'll have to excuse me.       

233
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:44,554
        One more thing, Karl,   
      just what is your message?

234
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:47,590
We must restore this country    
to a position of power.         

235
00:18:47,692 --> 00:18:52,696
Let the weak, the lazy,         
the uneducated                  

236
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,933
get out of the way.             

237
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,473
    (door opens then closes)    

238
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,574
    (toilet flushing)           

239
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:34,604
            MUELLER:            
              <i>Nein!</i>             

240
00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:29,493
Jack, you're making me nervous. 

241
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,662
          You should be nervous.
         He's trying to kill us.

242
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,930
 The Butcher isn't hunting us.  
          He can't be.          

243
00:20:33,998 --> 00:20:36,099
        All right, then you tell
            me what's happening.

244
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:37,534
        Look, I'll admit        
          that Mueller          

245
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:38,869
         was into some          
      pretty weird things.      

246
00:20:38,936 --> 00:20:40,771
     But he didn't know how     
    to raise the dead.          

247
00:20:40,838 --> 00:20:42,640
         I wouldn't be too sure.

248
00:20:51,816 --> 00:20:53,817
     I haven't opened this      
         since the war.         

249
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,858
                What the hell is
                     this stuff?

250
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:04,394
Things I collected              
in Europe.                      

251
00:21:10,768 --> 00:21:13,002
        This...                 

252
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,772
is Mueller's diary.             

253
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,508
             Diary?             

254
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:19,743
                Look at that.   

255
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,812
It's just a swastika.           

256
00:21:21,846 --> 00:21:23,580
Yes, but the surrounding circle 
    makes it a symbol           

257
00:21:23,648 --> 00:21:24,748
     for the Thule Society.     

258
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,116
          Come again?           

259
00:21:26,217 --> 00:21:29,586
    The Thule Society           
 was an ancient Teutonic group  

260
00:21:29,653 --> 00:21:31,888
  of alchemists and warlocks.   

261
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:34,391
 They believed they could grant 
     ten centuries of life.     

262
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,192
  You're not making any sense.  

263
00:21:37,862 --> 00:21:42,332
I'm trying to tell you that     
Mueller used Thule secrets      

264
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:44,500
to bring Rausch back to life.   

265
00:21:44,568 --> 00:21:47,003
                Do you expect me
                to believe that?

266
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:51,375
          Look, Jack, you need  
         some sleep, right now. 

267
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,980
      I'm phoning Simpson.      

268
00:21:57,047 --> 00:21:58,147
     He should be with us.      

269
00:21:58,215 --> 00:21:59,583
                      Good idea.

270
00:21:59,684 --> 00:22:02,252
He may talk some sense into you.

271
00:22:17,835 --> 00:22:19,136
    (engine starting)           

272
00:22:19,203 --> 00:22:20,570
        ANNOUNCER:              
    You are listening           
    to a re-broadcast           

273
00:22:20,638 --> 00:22:21,871
of The Karl Stiener Show.       

274
00:22:21,939 --> 00:22:23,106
     No phone calls please.     

275
00:22:23,174 --> 00:22:25,275
            RAUSCH:             
Karl Stiener. What do you think?

276
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:27,344
              MAN:              
  I think you're a racist pig.  

277
00:22:27,411 --> 00:22:29,646
            RAUSCH:             
      Listen, I don't have      
    anything against anybody    

278
00:22:29,713 --> 00:22:31,148
     if they're productive.     

279
00:22:31,215 --> 00:22:32,749
    But let's face it,          
        some people use         

280
00:22:32,816 --> 00:22:36,419
 aspiring to impossible heights 
 as an excuse to go on welfare. 

281
00:22:36,487 --> 00:22:39,822
They think "If I can't be       
      Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,      

282
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,993
        I'll sell crack         
      till I get a break."      
         What an idiot.         

283
00:22:43,027 --> 00:22:44,361
              MAN:              
      You know something?       

284
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,663
      If this conversation      
         was in person,         

285
00:22:46,731 --> 00:22:49,299
      I'd be real tempted       
    to rearrange your face.     

286
00:22:51,735 --> 00:22:53,637
         (sharp crack)          

287
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:01,845
     Should have been here      
         two hours ago.         

288
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:03,180
     Where the hell is he?      

289
00:23:05,282 --> 00:23:07,184
        (phone ringing)         

290
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,195
Curious Goods. Marshak.         

291
00:23:20,264 --> 00:23:21,765
     Oh, God.                   

292
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:24,334
(indistinct radio transmissions)

293
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:26,069
    (camera shutter clicks)     

294
00:23:26,137 --> 00:23:28,738
            We found him slumped
      over the wheel of his car.

295
00:23:28,806 --> 00:23:32,409
    We think he was strangled   
     with a piece of piano wire.

296
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:33,743
              We're still trying
                to figure out   

297
00:23:33,811 --> 00:23:35,879
            what caused these   
                 puncture marks.

298
00:23:35,946 --> 00:23:38,215
          Barbed wire.          

299
00:23:38,282 --> 00:23:39,749
                    Could be.   

300
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,551
(whistling "Lili Marlene")      

301
00:24:06,243 --> 00:24:07,844
Rausch can't be alive.          

302
00:24:07,912 --> 00:24:09,513
It isn't possible.              

303
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,516
    You'd be surprised at the   
    things that are possible.   

304
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:19,856
  The Thule Society was feared  
  throughout Medieval Europe,   

305
00:24:19,924 --> 00:24:21,858
     very powerful wizards      

306
00:24:21,926 --> 00:24:23,193
          said to have          
     learned their secrets      

307
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,529
  from the ancient Norse gods.  

308
00:24:25,596 --> 00:24:28,198
Jack, I can't believe this      
sort of thing can happen.       

309
00:24:28,265 --> 00:24:31,067
              I can, and it did.

310
00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:34,204
They infused their powers       
    in silver amulets           

311
00:24:34,271 --> 00:24:37,207
      which could seek out      
         their enemies,         

312
00:24:37,274 --> 00:24:39,876
communicate over great distances

313
00:24:39,944 --> 00:24:44,414
      and raise the dead.       

314
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,550
          Rausch would have been
             an ideal candidate.

315
00:24:46,617 --> 00:24:47,951
                He was one of   
            Hitler's favorites--

316
00:24:48,018 --> 00:24:49,753
            an intelligent...   

317
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,055
                      dangerous,
                powerful man.   

318
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:53,790
And Mueller has such an amulet? 

319
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:55,192
         Yes, he does.          

320
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:56,559
But he's been                   

321
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,728
in prison since the night       
        we grabbed him.         

322
00:24:58,796 --> 00:25:01,164
  There's no way that Mueller   

323
00:25:01,232 --> 00:25:04,000
     could resurrect Rausch     
          without it.           

324
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:06,270
                So he got it, or
         someone got it for him.

325
00:25:14,244 --> 00:25:16,446
              Overseas operator?

326
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:19,649
            I want to place a   
        call to West Germany.   

327
00:25:19,717 --> 00:25:21,518
              Yes, to the warden

328
00:25:21,585 --> 00:25:25,455
          of the Allied Military
            Prison in Berlin.   

329
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:27,256
        Thank you, I'll hold.   

330
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:30,360
            RAUSCH:             
 I know it isn't a very popular 
    view to hold these days,    

331
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:33,463
      but, uh, the simple       
    facts of life are           

332
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:36,199
that this country's being       
     held back by deadbeats     

333
00:25:36,266 --> 00:25:40,537
 living on welfare, food stamps 
     and Medicare handouts.     

334
00:25:40,604 --> 00:25:43,906
The people who work for a living
      are being bled dry.       

335
00:25:43,974 --> 00:25:45,107
              MAN:              
      You're right, Karl.       

336
00:25:45,175 --> 00:25:46,242
    You're absolutely right.    

337
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,311
        You know, I paid        
  a fortune in taxes this year  

338
00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:50,413
and what did I get for it?      
        I ask you.              

339
00:25:50,481 --> 00:25:52,549
            MUELLER:            

340
00:25:52,616 --> 00:25:55,218
              MAN:              
    ...buying yachts,           
while people in this country... 

341
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:26,783
            WARDEN:             
     <i>Of course, Herr Mueller</i>    
   <i>is in custody, Mr. Marshak,</i>  

342
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:28,952
        but regulations         
      strictly forbid him       

343
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,587
     receiving phone calls      
      or uncensored mail.       

344
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:34,190
                Warden, I've got
                to speak to him.

345
00:26:34,258 --> 00:26:37,193
 Then you'll have to come here. 

346
00:26:37,261 --> 00:26:39,195
              Okay, then I'll be
              on the next plane.

347
00:26:39,263 --> 00:26:40,429
Jack, you're in                 
no shape to...                  

348
00:26:40,497 --> 00:26:41,865
                Yeah, well...   
             When can I see him?

349
00:26:41,932 --> 00:26:43,199
      Whenever you arrive,      

350
00:26:43,267 --> 00:26:45,502
    but you will need           
     a security clearance.      

351
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:48,538
      It has been required      
    since his escape.           

352
00:26:48,605 --> 00:26:50,406
                Mueller escaped?

353
00:26:50,474 --> 00:26:52,075
          A year ago.           

354
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,877
    He got across the wall,     

355
00:26:53,944 --> 00:26:56,880
but the East German police      
    caught him the next day.    

356
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,883
          Oh, my God.           

357
00:27:09,226 --> 00:27:10,160
Why aren't you ready?           

358
00:27:10,227 --> 00:27:11,928
The plane leaves                
in just over an hour.           

359
00:27:11,996 --> 00:27:14,030
                 I saw enough of
                 Germany in '45.

360
00:27:14,098 --> 00:27:15,065
                  I'm not going.

361
00:27:15,132 --> 00:27:16,833
You can't stay here             
    by yourself.                

362
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,368
                I never ran away
             from anybody, Jack.

363
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:19,502
        I'm not starting now.   

364
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:20,837
We're not running away.         

365
00:27:20,904 --> 00:27:22,805
We're staying together          
until this thing's over.        

366
00:27:22,873 --> 00:27:24,441
Look, if you're alone,          
he has a chance                 

367
00:27:24,508 --> 00:27:26,509
of picking you off,             
just like he did the others.    

368
00:27:26,577 --> 00:27:28,178
                  I'm not going.

369
00:27:28,245 --> 00:27:29,846
Well, then you'll be            
a sitting duck.                 

370
00:27:29,913 --> 00:27:32,182
        Lefty and Simpson didn't
             know what hit them.

371
00:27:32,249 --> 00:27:34,184
                I'll be watching
                for the bastard.

372
00:27:41,392 --> 00:27:42,725
This...                         

373
00:27:42,793 --> 00:27:44,861
saw me through Europe.          

374
00:27:44,928 --> 00:27:46,863
Keep it close.                  

375
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,531
Here.                           

376
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:50,533
              Don't worry, Jack.

377
00:27:50,601 --> 00:27:53,203
                  I can take    
            care of myself.     

378
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,205
    Yeah.                       

379
00:27:55,272 --> 00:27:57,740
You're the only troops          
that I've got now.
