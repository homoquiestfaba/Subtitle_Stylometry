1
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,833
GEE, YOU LOOK SO FINE.

2
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,740
GEE, YOU SHOULD BE MINE.

3
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,812
GEE, OH HOW I PINE.

4
00:00:33,516 --> 00:00:35,916
GEE, YOU SURE ARE FINE.

5
00:00:36,686 --> 00:00:39,086
GEE, LIKE...

6
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,891
GEE, AND THAT'S NO LIE.

7
00:00:45,495 --> 00:00:47,690
YOU SURE LOOK GOOD TO ME.

8
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:50,257
MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS.

9
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:53,466
YOU THRILL ME BODACIOUS.

10
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:56,764
YOU'RE MY ADMIRATION LIKE...

11
00:00:56,906 --> 00:01:00,205
A SWINGING KING
WHEN IT STARTS TO SWING.

12
00:01:00,577 --> 00:01:02,704
GEE, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME?

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,209
GEE, I'M IN LOVE...

14
00:01:05,348 --> 00:01:08,511
YOU SEE. GEE, CAN'T WE AGREE?

15
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,814
ON ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR,
YOU AND ME.

16
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:02,962
GEE, YOU LOOK SO FINE.

17
00:02:03,673 --> 00:02:05,903
GEE, YOU SHOULD BE MINE.

18
00:02:06,576 --> 00:02:08,942
GEE, OH HOW I PINE.

19
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,113
GEE, YOU SURE ARE FINE.

20
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:15,041
GEE, LIKE CHERRY PIE.

21
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:18,116
GEE, I HOPE TO DIE.

22
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,118
GEE, AND THAT'S NO LIE.

23
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:24,219
JACK, YOU SURE LOOK GOOD TO ME.

24
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:25,184
MY...

25
00:02:25,328 --> 00:02:27,523
GOODNESS GRACIOUS.

26
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:30,258
YOU THRILL ME BODACIOUS.

27
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:32,797
YOU'RE MY ADMIRATION...

28
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,627
LIKE A SWINGING KING...

29
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:36,864
WHEN IT STARTS TO SWING.

30
00:02:37,106 --> 00:02:39,336
GEE WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME?

31
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:43,374
GEE, I'M IN LOVE, YOU SEE.
GEE...

32
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:45,071
CAN WE AGREE?

33
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:48,446
ON ONE, TWO,
THREE, FOUR, YOU AND ME.

34
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:24,044
Hey, we're all proud of you, Buster.
Charlie.

35
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,988
Small town cops dropping
a pair like this.

36
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,857
Wait a lifetime, never even
sniff one this good.

37
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,655
Wanna make a move to the boroughs,
you let me know.

38
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,023
It's a phone call.

39
00:03:34,597 --> 00:03:36,792
Hey, maybe you
wanna throw the switch.

40
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:38,025
I can fix that, too.

41
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,969
You are such an asshole.

42
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:43,729
You don't even know
what you have here.

43
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:47,933
Whatever it is,
consider it our gift to you.

44
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:54,339
You know,
you don't have to go in there.

45
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,580
Yeah, I do.

46
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:08,862
If any two maggots ever deserved
to boil in their own shit,

47
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:11,499
it was Ray Fernandez
and Martha Beck.

48
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:13,965
They'd probably still be cozy

49
00:04:14,103 --> 00:04:16,435
in a Lansing jail cell
if it werert for Buster.

50
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,599
Or, maybe it was Annie.
Buster's wife.

51
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:26,915
Who one September night stuck
a service thirty-eight in her ear.

52
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,712
No note. No nothir.

53
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,520
Just blew her brains
out all over the bathtub.

54
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,520
Cops don't talk about what they see.

55
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:42,490
They push it down with a stiff Bromo
and a bourbon back, hide behind a...

56
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:46,329
newspaper and hope nobody notices.
But after...

57
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:49,063
Buster found Annie in the bathroom,
that all changed.

58
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:53,139
And he took it out on Fernandez
and Beck with a vengeance.

59
00:04:59,582 --> 00:05:01,413
If they wrote
a book on confidence men,

60
00:05:01,784 --> 00:05:03,809
Ray Fernandez would've
been the pinup boy.

61
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:09,519
He wasrt the first rat-fuck barnacle
to play the Ionely hearts game.

62
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:15,092
But he might've been the smoothest.
He knew the game, he knew his marks.

63
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:17,198
He loved the way it made him feel.

64
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:21,798
Hell, he was so slick, he even convinced
himself he was Don-fucking-Juan.

65
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:24,670
Oh Bea...

66
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:28,038
I'm so sorry I'm late.
A thousand apologies.

67
00:05:28,177 --> 00:05:31,078
So sorry I'm late.
The meetings with my lawyers ran over.

68
00:05:31,214 --> 00:05:32,408
I'm so sorry I'm late.

69
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:34,209
Had a meeting with my lawyers.
It went over.

70
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,817
I nearly missed the plane.

71
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:36,917
I was in such a hurry I...

72
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:39,647
left my wallet and my passport.

73
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:42,223
I left my wallet and my passport.

74
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:45,691
And I left my passport
and my wallet...

75
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:48,058
on the counter at the airport.

76
00:05:48,865 --> 00:05:49,422
You're even more...

77
00:05:49,565 --> 00:05:51,055
beautiful than your picture.

78
00:05:52,568 --> 00:05:53,830
Stunning.

79
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:56,338
Today's a special day.

80
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:03,343
It's the oldest con in the book.

81
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,915
He pen paled 'em, war widows,
old maids, spinsters, anyone alone.

82
00:06:09,318 --> 00:06:10,717
Was like picking plums.

83
00:06:11,254 --> 00:06:14,451
They advertised, for Christ sake,
through correspondence clubs

84
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,989
and Ionely hearts rags.

85
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:17,890
He was quite the bard.

86
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,755
Always slipping in a little
fishing expedition to feel...

87
00:06:20,897 --> 00:06:25,994
out their bank account.
If he smelled... money, Valentino.

88
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:27,499
If he thought they were broke...

89
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:30,571
he'd bounce 'em...
like a bad check.

90
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:41,015
Buster was my partner.

91
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:44,276
We went all the way back to a squad car,
for Christ sake.

92
00:06:45,555 --> 00:06:47,420
He was the toughest badge
I'd ever seen.

93
00:06:48,024 --> 00:06:50,322
Turned more collars than
a Chinaman drycleaner.

94
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,723
But after he lost Annie,
he parked himself behind the desk,

95
00:06:54,964 --> 00:06:59,560
pushing paper, taking phone calls,
and a lot of other people's shit.

96
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:01,827
I didn't understand that.

97
00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:04,030
Robinson, Homicide.

98
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,231
You don't know shit
because Jackie Robinson is a...

99
00:07:05,374 --> 00:07:07,672
I don't know shit?
Veteran baseball...

100
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:08,708
Fuck Jackie Robinson.

101
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,608
Jesus Christ, let me tell you
something so everybody can hear me.

102
00:07:10,746 --> 00:07:11,838
You gave me a hundred to one.

103
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:12,948
Hundred to one I wouldn't drop

104
00:07:13,082 --> 00:07:14,777
a nickel on the first team
to put a nigger in baseball.

105
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:17,613
Okay? Even, even if he
is a cousin of Robinsors here.

106
00:07:17,753 --> 00:07:18,913
Okay?

107
00:07:19,255 --> 00:07:20,244
It's okay.

108
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:21,913
Hello. Oh, Mrs. Reilly?

109
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:23,992
Oh, Reilly,
your wife's on the phone.

110
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:25,316
Her negro lover just left,

111
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:27,326
wants to know if I can
come down there and finish her off.

112
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:28,157
How you gonna...
finish her off,

113
00:07:28,297 --> 00:07:30,288
you haven't seen your prick
in six months, you fat fuck.

114
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:31,798
That's funny, your wife...
found it real good.

115
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:33,629
You think I'm scared of you...
you big fuckir sack of meat?

116
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:34,633
- Get outta here.
- Why don't ya...

117
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,930
keep your mouth shut
and learn something?

118
00:07:36,072 --> 00:07:37,061
Fuck you.

119
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,436
I'm telling you, he's gonna
burn your house... down one day.

120
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:40,667
He's a rat.

121
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:43,210
Listen, me and Eastman,
we're going over to Jimmy's.

122
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:46,509
We're gonna uh, play some cards,
suck on the beer tit, tell some lies.

123
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:47,673
How 'bout it?

124
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:49,008
Hey Robbie.

125
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:50,210
Hey Rene.

126
00:07:51,988 --> 00:07:53,853
I can't.
I... gotta take the train tonight.

127
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:55,957
Train?
What happened to your car?

128
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:57,081
What, you didn't hear?

129
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,989
The kid drove
it into some garbage cans.

130
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:00,754
Siren going, lights, everything.

131
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:01,727
Which bone did you break?

132
00:08:01,864 --> 00:08:03,024
The one between his ears.

133
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,063
Hey, I can drop you.

134
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,225
Yeah, Rene could give you...
a lift.

135
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:09,167
Nice.

136
00:08:09,305 --> 00:08:09,862
Okay.

137
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:10,802
Enough.

138
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,838
What?

139
00:08:11,974 --> 00:08:13,168
So we...
playing cards or what?

140
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:14,742
No, but I'II...
take that ride.

141
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:16,205
Meet ya at Jimmy's.

142
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,342
By the time Fernandez picked up

143
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:25,818
on Martha Beck's bullshit smear
in some Ionely hearts rag...

144
00:08:26,222 --> 00:08:27,712
she'd already
been picked over by every...

145
00:08:27,857 --> 00:08:31,384
Tom-Dick son of a bitch who ever
sniffed a skirt, including her own...

146
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:35,293
brother, who started raping her from...
the time she was ten.

147
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:37,897
She was good-Iooking, alright.

148
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:40,033
But damaged goods.

149
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:43,062
Martha.

150
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,163
Raymond.

151
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:48,669
Uh, uh, I'm sorry I'm late.

152
00:08:48,844 --> 00:08:51,608
The meetings with my uh,
lawyers ran over.

153
00:08:52,014 --> 00:08:53,606
I was in such a hurry I...

154
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,017
I nearly missed my plane

155
00:08:55,151 --> 00:08:58,086
and I left my wallet
and passport at the counter.

156
00:08:58,654 --> 00:09:00,189
What kind of lawyers?

157
00:09:00,189 --> 00:09:05,058
Oh... just, u- regular lawyers.

158
00:09:05,861 --> 00:09:10,059
We're closing in on some uh,
some import prospects.

159
00:09:14,904 --> 00:09:19,034
I can't believe you're here.
I can't believe we're here.

160
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:23,042
I mean af- after so many letters...
and for such a long time, it's...

161
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:25,878
It's incredible.

162
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,609
I mean, here we are...
face to face.

163
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:30,608
Oh, what?

164
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:32,243
Please say something.

165
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:33,548
I uh...

166
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:37,987
You're just so beautiful.

167
00:09:39,195 --> 00:09:41,356
May I... show you to a table?

168
00:09:41,597 --> 00:09:43,064
How's room service?

169
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,757
It's off the menu, ma'am.

170
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,398
We'll have... breakfast in bed.

171
00:09:53,242 --> 00:09:54,266
What are you doing?

172
00:09:54,543 --> 00:09:56,602
I have an appointment.
I won't be an hour.

173
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:00,643
I love the way you write.

174
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,076
Such a poet.

175
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:05,050
Raymond?

176
00:10:05,788 --> 00:10:07,619
You don't disappoint.

177
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,020
A regular Charles Boyer.

178
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,859
Hey, what d'you say we...

179
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,992
test our luck later,
watch the greyhounds run?

180
00:10:21,971 --> 00:10:23,404
Think you can wait... for me?

181
00:10:23,572 --> 00:10:24,869
Oh, I can wait.

182
00:10:25,574 --> 00:10:27,633
The question is, can you?

183
00:10:34,984 --> 00:10:36,952
Hey, you're a little kitty cat.

184
00:10:43,192 --> 00:10:44,159
Toodle-Ioo.

185
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,058
Toodle-Ioo.

186
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:55,103
Maybe he skinned out
'cause she was broke.

187
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,535
Or maybe he was afraid
she was a keeper.

188
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,532
Either way, Martha had him...
figured at Hello.

189
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,449
Thou anointest my head with oil,
my cup runneth over.

190
00:11:09,852 --> 00:11:13,686
Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life.

191
00:11:13,856 --> 00:11:17,656
And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord... forever. Amen.

192
00:11:31,307 --> 00:11:32,535
Dorothy.

193
00:11:32,975 --> 00:11:35,341
My deepest sympathies.

194
00:11:35,478 --> 00:11:36,775
Well thank you.

195
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,747
I'm sorry. Raymond...

196
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:41,748
Martin.
I was a customer of your husband's.

197
00:11:41,884 --> 00:11:44,409
He was a tough...
but honest businessman.

198
00:11:44,553 --> 00:11:47,750
And I know he'll be missed,
that son of a gun.

199
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,185
What company...
you with?

200
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:52,817
Bradley Coachworks in Cleveland.
I manage receivables.

201
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,123
So you know our...
account man, Ben Chadwick.

202
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:58,332
Of course.
Ben, he's a good man.

203
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,832
Anybody who knew
my father knew he was...

204
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,027
a son of a bitch.

205
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,195
And Ben Chadwick's
been dead five years.

206
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:08,671
Oh my... god!

207
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:11,770
Oh my god!

208
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:18,186
My husband's company has been
a loyal customer for many years.

209
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,285
In spite of your...
disregard for the deceased,

210
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,621
he did a fair business with us.

211
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,654
And it's disgraceful
that you'd humiliate a...

212
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,460
patron on this, of all days.

213
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:35,727
Shame on you!
Shame on you.

214
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:39,331
Let's go, baby.
Let's go, baby.

215
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:41,067
Shame on you!

216
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,442
Come on.
Are you okay?

217
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,945
I'm okay.

218
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:50,814
It's hard to say whose...
voodoo was working on who.

219
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:54,085
But the day them
two figured each other out

220
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:57,418
was the beginning of
a bad end for a lot of people.

221
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,188
So what's up with Rene?

222
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:03,696
You don't need to know.

223
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,960
What, she's got those uh,
silver dollar summits.

224
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:08,195
Am I right?

225
00:13:09,104 --> 00:13:11,595
Come on.
A week's pay for confirmation.

226
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,037
You don't make enough, Charlie.

227
00:13:13,175 --> 00:13:13,903
Well that's true.

228
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,010
- Slow down here.
- Leave it alone.

229
00:13:15,144 --> 00:13:16,202
- Slow down. Slow down.
- Leave it alone.

230
00:13:16,345 --> 00:13:17,505
No-no, come on, stop.

231
00:13:17,646 --> 00:13:18,408
Come on.

232
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,741
Stop.

233
00:13:23,786 --> 00:13:24,480
What're you doing?

234
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,315
- Borrowing money?
- Shut... the fuck up.

235
00:13:26,455 --> 00:13:27,444
What're you doing?

236
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:31,817
Back up! Back up, now!

237
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:33,828
Back up, shit stick.

238
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,965
We gotta get him to County.

239
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:41,033
You're not putting...
that bloody mess in my car.

240
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,698
Let's go.

241
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:46,965
What?

242
00:13:47,109 --> 00:13:49,976
Look. Look at my car.
It's full of blood.

243
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:52,406
Next time you take the train.

244
00:13:52,548 --> 00:13:53,515
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:54,274
Oh.

246
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,007
I'll pay for it.

247
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,310
My ass.

248
00:13:57,353 --> 00:13:59,378
What're you trying to do anyway,
get yourself killed?

249
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:06,057
Baker Baker.
Baker Baker, you up?

250
00:14:07,796 --> 00:14:08,990
Two Baker Baker.

251
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:11,793
Deceased female in Wantaugh,
twenty-seven thirty-two Merrick Road.

252
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:12,992
Possible suicide.

253
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:14,432
Uh, we're ten-ten.

254
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:16,698
Detective Reilly
requested you, sir.

255
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:19,365
I've been babysitting this
fuckir midget for a year, now.

256
00:14:19,508 --> 00:14:20,770
Let's just go.

257
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:22,275
- With you?
- Yeah.

258
00:14:22,411 --> 00:14:24,402
- Nah.
- No-no, let's just do it.

259
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,872
Come on.

260
00:14:29,885 --> 00:14:31,375
Two Baker Baker en route.

261
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,387
It's raining out there.

262
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:39,224
You know if she had
any family or relatives?

263
00:14:39,662 --> 00:14:41,596
I, you know, I don't... know.

264
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,856
What's the story?

265
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,262
We're supposed to be off duty.

266
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,966
Well the book says uh,
two detectives from Homicide.

267
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:48,463
What're you... doing here?

268
00:14:48,604 --> 00:14:50,697
Me? I was losing.

269
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,468
Suspicious.

270
00:14:53,342 --> 00:14:54,707
You are such a piece of shit.

271
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,839
That's not really the point,
is it?

272
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,858
Patty Forsythe, twenty-five.

273
00:15:16,231 --> 00:15:19,564
Filleted the radial,
couple superficials.

274
00:15:19,702 --> 00:15:22,899
Had a hard time getting started
but eventually got it right.

275
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,335
Good, all we need is...

276
00:15:24,473 --> 00:15:26,498
some celery sticks and we can
have a couple Bloody Marys.

277
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,274
Why is this suspicious?

278
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:30,210
Why is it suspicious?

279
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,509
Well, look, tasty... dame.
Right? She got a nice place.

280
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:34,206
She got a job.

281
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,942
What, out of the blue
she just decides to play...

282
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:37,177
connect the dots with a razor?

283
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:37,944
Come on.

284
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:39,918
All right, everybody out.

285
00:15:40,055 --> 00:15:40,646
Let's go.

286
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:43,257
I want names and badges.
Everyone.

287
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:44,688
Come... on.

288
00:15:44,827 --> 00:15:47,387
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- Huh?

289
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:48,325
What do you mean
what's wrong with me?

290
00:15:48,464 --> 00:15:49,590
It's a suicide.

291
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:51,063
A minute ago you said
it was suspicious.

292
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,666
Which is it?

293
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,530
It's a suspicious suicide.
How's that?

294
00:15:57,506 --> 00:16:00,066
I make her a snow cone uh,
thirty-six to forty-eight.

295
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:00,766
Mm-hm.

296
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:02,968
She used ice.
Probably thought it would hurt.

297
00:16:03,112 --> 00:16:04,306
Yeah... probably did.

298
00:16:04,647 --> 00:16:07,707
Vascular contractions would
explain the false starts.

299
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,680
Alright, give me a liver...
temp on her.

300
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,683
So, since...
when is he back on the job?

301
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,086
He's always been on the job.

302
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,190
- Oh. Really?
- Mm.

303
00:16:15,324 --> 00:16:17,849
See that, all this time I'm thinking
he works for the fuckir phone company.

304
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,452
You called us, remember?

305
00:16:19,595 --> 00:16:20,994
- Mm-hm.
- He's top dick.

306
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,825
Yeah, he is.
You got that right.

307
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:24,488
Why don't you
keep your mouth shut.

308
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:25,657
Why?
What, is he gonna do something?

309
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:26,631
He's not gonna do anything.

310
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:28,430
You know why?
'Cause he's a fucking pug.

311
00:16:30,472 --> 00:16:31,598
Keep it up.

312
00:16:32,474 --> 00:16:34,271
Donuts for the note.
Reilly's buying.

313
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,604
There's no note.

314
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:36,938
There is a note.

315
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:39,208
She wanted
to get somebody's attention.

316
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:40,871
You'd know all about that,
wouldn't you?

317
00:16:41,316 --> 00:16:42,078
Hey.

318
00:16:42,217 --> 00:16:43,479
Hey-hey. I can't...

319
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:44,643
You bite...
your fuckir tongue out, you...

320
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:45,776
Hey. Hear me?

321
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,183
Huh?

322
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:48,946
I can't...

323
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:57,925
Found it.

324
00:16:59,068 --> 00:17:00,399
Eclair for me, shit stick.

325
00:17:00,536 --> 00:17:01,833
Fuck you.

326
00:17:22,524 --> 00:17:23,923
Hey.

327
00:17:36,672 --> 00:17:38,105
Don't forget my father.

328
00:17:54,356 --> 00:17:56,085
So your sister's got Eddie?

329
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,319
Yeah, but I still gotta go.

330
00:18:02,765 --> 00:18:04,494
It's two in the morning.

331
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:08,602
Yup. I gotta go.

332
00:18:12,307 --> 00:18:13,569
Where are my pants?

333
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:14,971
Over here.

334
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:19,740
How long you gonna
keep me a secret, huh?

335
00:18:20,749 --> 00:18:22,478
You're no secret.
Trust me.

336
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:26,354
Shoes?

337
00:18:26,488 --> 00:18:28,080
They're down over there.

338
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,282
Oh yeah. I heard the Dispatch.
You okay?

339
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:32,654
Yeah.

340
00:18:32,961 --> 00:18:36,488
I mean come on, that's my job.
Been doing it a long time.

341
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:39,400
That doesn't
mean you're not human.

342
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,602
I don't wanna talk about it.

343
00:18:42,971 --> 00:18:44,598
Hey, I'm... not your wife.

344
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,133
So don't treat me like one.

345
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,039
I'm sorry.

346
00:18:55,083 --> 00:19:01,249
You know Eddie, he never cried.
Not even at the funeral.

347
00:19:01,423 --> 00:19:02,117
No?

348
00:19:02,257 --> 00:19:03,349
No.

349
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,787
Kid shouldn't
have to be that tough.

350
00:19:07,496 --> 00:19:08,724
Neither should you.

351
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,494
Make you some eggs?

352
00:19:16,305 --> 00:19:19,433
You're a doll.
But I gotta go.

353
00:19:23,045 --> 00:19:24,376
Bye. See you later.

354
00:19:24,613 --> 00:19:26,046
Okay. Wanna take my car?

355
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:30,412
Nah. I'll just walk down to Merrick...
take the bus.

356
00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:32,380
It'll be easier.

357
00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:34,144
Okay.

358
00:19:48,537 --> 00:19:49,902
How'd you find me?

359
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:52,531
I'm a detective, remember?

360
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:55,801
Well, I thought
maybe you was a peeping Tom.

361
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:02,913
You know uh,
no one's gonna hold her against you.

362
00:20:03,652 --> 00:20:05,620
Yeah, except for maybe my son.

363
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:11,121
Two fights in one night.
That's pretty good.

364
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:13,788
And Reilly.

365
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,166
Reilly's a... fuckir idiot.
You used to know that.

366
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,858
I don't know, Charlie.

367
00:20:21,336 --> 00:20:23,770
People don't just punch out
for no reason.

368
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:28,334
Yeah well, she had a reason.

369
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,447
Uh, I was talking about Annie.

370
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,075
Yeah, I know.

371
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,347
All right, so our girl, she comes
home early with the groceries.

372
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:44,158
She's looking
for a little romance.

373
00:20:44,293 --> 00:20:49,287
She's got uh, candles,
bottle of chianti, and some rib eyes.

374
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:53,598
She sees the boyfriend through
the back door with his sister

375
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:56,636
bent over the table, here,
doing a donkey.

376
00:20:57,439 --> 00:20:58,531
A sister?

377
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,604
Yeah, sister.

378
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:00,503
Bent over...

379
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:02,769
Seen them through the back...
door on this table.

380
00:21:03,045 --> 00:21:04,535
People are work.
What can I tell ya?

381
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,942
Jesus Christ.

382
00:21:06,081 --> 00:21:10,711
All right, so, she leaves,
comes back after they're gone.

383
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:15,346
She scrubs the table with Brillo.
Goes into the bathroom.

384
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,254
You know the rest.

385
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:18,620
Did they dust?

386
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,161
No.

387
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,420
Why not?

388
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:22,526
Because while fucking around

389
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:24,825
on your girlfriend may be shitty,
it ain't illegal.

390
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:26,464
At least not yet, anyway.

391
00:21:26,735 --> 00:21:28,362
Well it... is,
if it's your sister.

392
00:21:30,138 --> 00:21:34,871
She had to have cash or...
jewelry or silverware or something.

393
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,671
Yeah, she had the ruby
slippers and the diamond broche

394
00:21:36,812 --> 00:21:38,780
she wears to the
steno pool every day.

395
00:21:39,414 --> 00:21:40,972
She worked for the L-I double-R,
for Christ sakes.

396
00:21:41,116 --> 00:21:42,481
She's got nothing.

397
00:21:43,752 --> 00:21:45,083
Let me stake you a...
roll of quarters,

398
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,881
we can still shine them
freebooters down at Jimmy's.

399
00:21:47,022 --> 00:21:47,579
Come on.

400
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,850
Nah. I gotta go home.

401
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,114
Yeah.

402
00:22:13,448 --> 00:22:14,506
Where you been?

403
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:16,647
Huh?

404
00:22:16,785 --> 00:22:18,047
You first.

405
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:22,655
Where you been?
You been out drinking? Huh?

406
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:23,621
- Buster.
- Let me smell your breath.

407
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,624
- Buster, don't. Buster, don't.
- Did you really do that?

408
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:26,955
- Stop it.
- Let me smell your breath.

409
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,062
- Stop. Buster, stop.
- This is...

410
00:22:28,196 --> 00:22:29,288
- Stop it. Stop it.
- Stay out of it, Ida.

411
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,125
Stop.

412
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,256
- So... What're you doing!
- What's wrong with you?

413
00:22:32,401 --> 00:22:33,095
What's wrong with you?

414
00:22:33,235 --> 00:22:35,760
I'm trying to keep you from making
an ass out of yourself.

415
00:22:35,904 --> 00:22:39,499
Ida, he wrecked the car a week ago.
He shouldn't even been driving.

416
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:42,610
He's been delivering papers
so he could pay to fix the car.

417
00:22:42,744 --> 00:22:44,473
He wanted to surprise you.

418
00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:49,013
Yeah, well, how the hell
was I supposed to know?

419
00:22:49,184 --> 00:22:51,516
I don't know, you tell me,
you're the cop.

420
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:55,484
Eddie. Eddie.

421
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:58,048
I'M IN TOWN.

422
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,054
CAN'T YOU HEAR ME HONEY,
I'M IN TOWN.

423
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:06,323
HANGIN' ROUN',
JUST WAITIN' FOR YOU.

424
00:23:08,203 --> 00:23:12,765
CAN'T YOU SEE, YOU'RE THE ONE
AND ONLY BO Y FOR ME.

425
00:23:13,608 --> 00:23:18,045
MM, YOU AND ME ARE.
UNINTELLIGIBLE.

426
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:23,846
Sweetest Delphine, your letter
of last week gives me such hope.

427
00:23:24,052 --> 00:23:26,282
The way you speak
of your daughter gives me

428
00:23:26,421 --> 00:23:30,619
a sense that there is love
in this world left for me.

429
00:23:31,193 --> 00:23:33,491
No-no-no-no, too soft,
too soft.

430
00:23:33,628 --> 00:23:35,186
And mention the kid's name,
mothers love that stuff.

431
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,922
It's the simple things.

432
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:41,033
I will arrive on March tenth
with my sister Martha.

433
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,101
Excellent.

434
00:23:42,237 --> 00:23:44,330
She's the hottest
bitch you've ever seen,

435
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:46,441
and does me like a kitten.

436
00:23:46,741 --> 00:23:48,140
That's for sure.

437
00:23:48,577 --> 00:23:49,874
Mm.

438
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,308
You smell like a pimp.

439
00:23:51,446 --> 00:23:53,880
That's the only way I can
get your scent off me, Kitty Cat.

440
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:56,209
Okay, okay, sign this.

441
00:23:57,052 --> 00:24:01,045
Yeah. Ray Martin.

442
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:08,687
Hey, hold on.

443
00:24:09,297 --> 00:24:10,389
What?

444
00:24:10,565 --> 00:24:11,793
Go get dressed.

445
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:13,161
What for?

446
00:24:14,236 --> 00:24:16,101
Because I want you with me.

447
00:24:16,471 --> 00:24:19,201
Really? Why?

448
00:24:20,742 --> 00:24:22,209
Make sure I behave.

449
00:24:22,944 --> 00:24:26,846
Besides,
I like it when you watch me work.

450
00:24:30,185 --> 00:24:31,914
So feisty.

451
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:38,725
I've been trying to get your
ass street side for a year,

452
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,792
and you wanna chase this?

453
00:24:39,928 --> 00:24:40,986
Yeah I do.

454
00:24:41,163 --> 00:24:42,391
If it'd make you feel better,

455
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:44,658
I'll put a car on the house,
maybe they'II... come back.

456
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:45,857
They're not coming back.

457
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:47,798
Look Buster, you wanna get your ass

458
00:24:47,936 --> 00:24:49,904
off the desk and get
back to work, that's great.

459
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:52,336
This thing,
it's just a heart break.

460
00:24:52,474 --> 00:24:54,271
Robbie,
Motor Pool sent up your keys.

461
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:55,501
Say your car's as good as new.

462
00:24:55,644 --> 00:24:56,838
Thanks.

463
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:07,415
Look, a girl don't rip herself up
like that for no reason.

464
00:25:07,556 --> 00:25:11,356
With all due respect to your wife,
this case isn't fucking about her.

465
00:25:14,362 --> 00:25:15,954
Let me tell you something, Mac.

466
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,793
You couldn't find a rattlesnake
in a fucking lunch bag.

467
00:25:19,234 --> 00:25:21,259
This is a Ionely
hearts a mile away.

468
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,904
Get outta my way,
I'll make you look like a genius.

469
00:25:23,972 --> 00:25:26,236
And don't ever mention
my wife again.

470
00:25:26,374 --> 00:25:28,239
It's none
of your fucking business!

471
00:25:31,646 --> 00:25:33,079
Fuckir asshole.

472
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:39,485
Wounds are consistent
with self-infliction.

473
00:25:40,388 --> 00:25:41,980
So, didn't we know that...
already?

474
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:43,819
She pregnant?

475
00:25:45,427 --> 00:25:46,894
Very good, Detective.

476
00:25:47,028 --> 00:25:48,723
Oh, Jesus Christ.

477
00:25:49,564 --> 00:25:50,622
Think she knew?

478
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,993
Can't help you there.

479
00:25:52,234 --> 00:25:54,293
Sure she did.
That was the hook.

480
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,501
She thought they were...
gonna be a family.

481
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,204
That's why she did it.

482
00:26:00,942 --> 00:26:02,341
What're you gonna
do with her body?

483
00:26:02,544 --> 00:26:03,704
No kin.

484
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,708
Probably send
it to the medical college.

485
00:26:05,847 --> 00:26:07,815
They're always looking
for cadavers.

486
00:26:08,516 --> 00:26:10,541
Call the Weiss Brothers
in Massapequa.

487
00:26:10,752 --> 00:26:14,244
Tell 'em I'll take care of it.
They know me there.

488
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,520
You know that girl in there?

489
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,255
No.

490
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:24,365
Why you paying
for her funeral?

491
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,023
Well, you know, medical schools,
they saw 'em up.

492
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,225
You wanna see her sawed up?

493
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,068
Tell you the truth,
I don't give a shit.

494
00:26:29,204 --> 00:26:30,034
Well you know,
maybe you should.

495
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,605
You got three daughters, right?
Think about it.

496
00:26:32,741 --> 00:26:35,539
You dropping a month of paychecks
on a box ain't gonna change nothir.

497
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,737
It's my paychecks.
Mine. Come on.

498
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,145
Hey, you okay?

499
00:26:42,584 --> 00:26:44,074
I'm fine.

500
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:45,648
Really?

501
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:48,584
Really. Let's go.

502
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,922
Remember what you told me
when I made detective?

503
00:26:57,465 --> 00:26:59,490
Huh? You said, do the job.
Make sure you go home.

504
00:26:59,634 --> 00:27:02,501
Don't tell your wife nothing,
and keep the blood out here.

505
00:27:02,837 --> 00:27:05,328
What do you think, you actually make...
a fucking difference out here?

506
00:27:06,107 --> 00:27:07,301
I was kind of hoping we did.

507
00:27:07,442 --> 00:27:09,774
We didn't make this fucking...
sewer, we just work in it.

508
00:27:10,412 --> 00:27:11,936
You taken a good look
at these people?

509
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,569
Huh?

510
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,511
They're fucking animals,
what they do to each other.

511
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,441
You're not gonna change that.

512
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,115
You know,
all I got is the job. Okay?

513
00:27:19,254 --> 00:27:21,688
That's a straight line.
I know that.

514
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,420
Uh, okay, you wanna do this,

515
00:27:25,694 --> 00:27:28,390
this makes some kind
of sense to you, fine.

516
00:27:28,997 --> 00:27:31,329
I'll back you up.
I owe you that.

517
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,391
But for both our sakes,
don't make it personal.

518
00:27:34,536 --> 00:27:38,597
Do it right.
Act like a cop.

519
00:27:45,714 --> 00:27:48,774
Ain't nothing out here
but bad road and trouble.

520
00:27:50,185 --> 00:27:51,618
It's beautiful.

521
00:27:51,786 --> 00:27:56,951
The woods... the silence.
No people.

522
00:27:57,459 --> 00:27:59,324
People die in the damn woods.

523
00:28:01,229 --> 00:28:03,595
And bears fuck there.

524
00:28:04,332 --> 00:28:07,529
By the time Fernandez and Beck
left Patty Forsythe in the bathtub...

525
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:10,763
they'd already conned a dozen
Janes from Staten Island to Miami Beach.

526
00:28:11,906 --> 00:28:14,807
Martha played the part
of Ray's spinster sister to a T.

527
00:28:15,377 --> 00:28:17,777
Who's the
best you've ever had, hm?

528
00:28:17,912 --> 00:28:18,879
Some sister.

529
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:27,820
Oh, shit! Shit, shit.
Martha, Martha stop.

530
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,356
It's the cop- it's the cops,
god damn it!

531
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:31,516
Stop.

532
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,427
Oh god! Oh god!

533
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,868
Oh, okay. Okay.
Okay, okay stop it.

534
00:28:42,003 --> 00:28:44,733
Come here.
Come here. Come on.

535
00:28:55,417 --> 00:28:57,977
Uh... shit. Shit.

536
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:00,914
License and registration.

537
00:29:01,055 --> 00:29:03,319
I wasrt speeding.
Was I speeding?

538
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:05,221
You were all
over the place, Mister.

539
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:16,666
What the hell are you... doing?

540
00:29:16,805 --> 00:29:18,500
Schooling you
a little, Raymond.

541
00:29:18,807 --> 00:29:22,038
The car is stolen, Martha.

542
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,772
I changed the plates, but if
he checks the registration, Jesus!

543
00:29:25,914 --> 00:29:27,313
I'II... take care of it.

544
00:29:28,116 --> 00:29:29,708
What're you gonna do?

545
00:29:31,052 --> 00:29:32,679
Explain it to him.

546
00:29:33,621 --> 00:29:35,555
Wait. Wait. Stop.

547
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,884
See what you did?

548
00:29:40,895 --> 00:29:42,726
Oh, my god.

549
00:29:43,264 --> 00:29:46,324
Martha. Martha.

550
00:30:12,193 --> 00:30:13,217
God.

551
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:20,924
Okay.

552
00:30:34,315 --> 00:30:35,509
Nice.

553
00:30:47,896 --> 00:30:49,454
Drive carefully.

554
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:52,496
Thanks.

555
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,538
Now...

556
00:31:02,043 --> 00:31:04,876
who's the best you've ever had, hm?

557
00:31:07,081 --> 00:31:08,241
You are.

558
00:31:08,383 --> 00:31:10,510
Best that peach
fuzz ever had, too.

559
00:31:10,652 --> 00:31:12,586
He shot off like a cap gun.

560
00:31:13,988 --> 00:31:17,287
Don't ever forget who...
butters your bread, Raymond.

561
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:21,395
Don't you ever love them.

562
00:31:22,997 --> 00:31:24,225
Who?

563
00:31:24,532 --> 00:31:26,056
Any of them.

564
00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:28,132
Don't even pretend.

565
00:31:29,003 --> 00:31:30,595
Understood?

566
00:31:32,373 --> 00:31:33,931
Yeah.

567
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,773
Let's go.

568
00:31:40,214 --> 00:31:41,442
It's hot.

569
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:52,927
My god...
why would she do that?

570
00:31:53,962 --> 00:31:55,759
I was hoping that you'd tell me.

571
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,731
She have any family?

572
00:31:59,734 --> 00:32:02,703
Um, she lost a husband in the war.

573
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,667
What about...
this Raymond guy?

574
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,204
Ray Martin?

575
00:32:06,808 --> 00:32:07,604
Ray Martin.

576
00:32:07,742 --> 00:32:11,007
Run it.
How'd they meet?

577
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,076
Why don't you...
just ask him?

578
00:32:13,448 --> 00:32:15,279
You got a number?
Address?

579
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:17,145
Oh my god, he doesn't know?

580
00:32:17,885 --> 00:32:20,376
He's from Florida.
I mean that- that's all I know.

581
00:32:20,722 --> 00:32:23,452
What was he like?
Is he a... good guy? Bad guy?

582
00:32:23,591 --> 00:32:24,148
Raymond?

583
00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:25,190
Yeah.

584
00:32:25,326 --> 00:32:26,850
He's a sweetheart.

585
00:32:26,995 --> 00:32:32,194
He's so... uh, handsome, you know.
He writes her letters and whatnot.

586
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,128
Poems, even.

587
00:32:34,302 --> 00:32:34,927
Poems.

588
00:32:35,069 --> 00:32:37,697
He uh...
never lets you pay for anything.

589
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,704
Loves to go dancing.

590
00:32:41,476 --> 00:32:44,809
He took us all out
to the Rivoli Ballroom one time.

591
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,408
He can really cut it up.

592
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:52,049
Where'd you learn to dance like this?
You should be in shows or something.

593
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,120
Me and
Arthur Murray go way back.

594
00:32:54,255 --> 00:32:55,517
The real Arthur Murray?

595
00:32:55,657 --> 00:32:58,626
Sure. When we get back from
Florida you can ask him all about it.

596
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,851
Tell me about Florida again, Ray.

597
00:33:00,995 --> 00:33:03,589
Can't be out of
this damn cold soon enough.

598
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:06,165
Tomorrow, sweetie,
on our drive down to the city,

599
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,791
I'll tell you about it as
many times as you want.

600
00:33:14,442 --> 00:33:17,343
In the meantime,
I'm gonna fill up these glasses.

601
00:33:17,478 --> 00:33:20,038
I can't stand
to see beauty go wanting.

602
00:33:27,789 --> 00:33:30,223
Ray said you got
separated during the war.

603
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:35,258
Oh yeah. My mother took me
to Spain to her hometown,

604
00:33:35,396 --> 00:33:37,023
when I was just a little girl.

605
00:33:37,298 --> 00:33:39,732
Then the war came
and we couldn't get out.

606
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,424
What happened to Ray?

607
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,533
He didn't tell you?

608
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:45,697
What?

609
00:33:46,507 --> 00:33:48,270
Don't tell him I told you,

610
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:51,472
but he worked for
the British Intelligence.

611
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,375
He fought fascists.

612
00:33:54,215 --> 00:33:55,807
Like a secret agent?

613
00:33:57,085 --> 00:33:58,814
You didn't hear it from me.

614
00:34:01,022 --> 00:34:02,853
I tell you something, Martha.

615
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:06,118
Spy or no spy, that brother

616
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,752
of yours makes me feel
positively adolescent.

617
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,125
Oh honey, you've got
something on your teeth.

618
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:49,424
Let me ask you something.

619
00:35:49,931 --> 00:35:52,365
What in the
fuck are we doing back here?

620
00:35:53,034 --> 00:35:53,898
He's got a hunch.

621
00:35:54,035 --> 00:35:57,004
He's got a hunch.
And this is uh, for what?

622
00:35:58,506 --> 00:36:01,634
Extractions.
Need a confession, you pull a tooth.

623
00:36:03,477 --> 00:36:05,001
Oh, okay.

624
00:36:05,446 --> 00:36:06,879
Oh Christ, what's that stink?

625
00:36:07,014 --> 00:36:08,311
Fucking rat.

626
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,776
This is a snipe hunt.
You know that, right?

627
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,615
Cupids Crossroads.

628
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:17,519
The club for Ionely
heart connections.

629
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:20,789
Have you ever passed someone
on a corner and wondered,

630
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,294
could that
be my immortal Capulet?

631
00:36:23,898 --> 00:36:27,334
My irr- irr- irrevocable Montague?

632
00:36:27,468 --> 00:36:30,028
At Cupids Crossroads,
no one escapes...

633
00:36:30,238 --> 00:36:31,762
the raptures of love.

634
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,934
How 'bout
this Dream Catcher?

635
00:36:35,343 --> 00:36:36,105
Mature female...

636
00:36:36,244 --> 00:36:39,680
Ioves nightlife, cozy fires
and bubble baths for two.

637
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:43,140
Reach out and tell me your dreams.
Your future Mrs...

638
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,751
W-R-l-T-E.

639
00:36:44,886 --> 00:36:46,581
Can have the pick of the litter,
Buster.

640
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:51,688
Casanova Cop and his naughty
nightstick seek receptacle for love.

641
00:36:51,993 --> 00:36:53,483
Are you kidding?
Half of these dames, they...

642
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,027
keep their teeth in a jar.

643
00:36:55,162 --> 00:36:57,027
They take dinner through
a god damn straw at night.

644
00:36:57,198 --> 00:36:58,859
Not Patty Forsythe.

645
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:00,391
These dames really want a date...

646
00:37:00,534 --> 00:37:02,365
they need to go straight
for the meat and potatoes.

647
00:37:02,503 --> 00:37:03,231
Okay?

648
00:37:03,371 --> 00:37:06,534
Wild female, she's rich, she likes
to cook, she likes to fuck.

649
00:37:06,707 --> 00:37:08,971
Need a personal post office
just to bag the mail.

650
00:37:09,076 --> 00:37:10,634
Well that's how I found your wife.

651
00:37:10,878 --> 00:37:12,436
What?
I didn't- I'm sorry, I was far away.

652
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,512
I couldn't hear what the...
fuck you said.

653
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,172
Come here,
you motherfucker.

654
00:37:16,684 --> 00:37:20,450
Very loving, older female
considered attractive,

655
00:37:20,588 --> 00:37:23,523
and compassionate and ready
to enjoy life to the fullest...

656
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:28,254
Ioves ballroom dancing
and nights under the stars.

657
00:37:30,965 --> 00:37:31,829
What d'ya got?

658
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:34,366
Mrs. Forsythe closed her
personal account five days ago.

659
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,629
She wrote a check
from this account

660
00:37:36,771 --> 00:37:39,296
and they deposited
it into a joint account.

661
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,702
With Ray Martin?

662
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:41,432
That's right.

663
00:37:41,575 --> 00:37:42,735
How much did she deposit?

664
00:37:42,977 --> 00:37:46,276
Mr. Martin deposited, let's see,
forty-eight hundred seventy dollars.

665
00:37:46,414 --> 00:37:48,905
Mrs. Forsythe transferred the
balance of her personal account...

666
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,109
six thousand six hundred
twenty-three dollars.

667
00:37:51,252 --> 00:37:52,014
Six thousand?

668
00:37:52,153 --> 00:37:53,552
For a combined...
total of eleven thousand,

669
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,282
four hundred and ninety-three
dollars in the... joint account.

670
00:37:56,424 --> 00:37:59,018
And now... you're saying that
account is closed as well?

671
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,860
The next day
Mr. Martin withdrew the balance.

672
00:38:01,996 --> 00:38:02,860
And that was a check?

673
00:38:02,997 --> 00:38:04,555
No... cash.

674
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,563
Thank you.

675
00:38:20,581 --> 00:38:21,479
So?

676
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,206
She had almost seven thousand.

677
00:38:23,617 --> 00:38:25,346
Yeah, seven thousand dollars
at thirty-five bucks

678
00:38:25,486 --> 00:38:27,249
a week is almost
four years pay.

679
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,616
Where'd she get that?

680
00:38:28,756 --> 00:38:29,950
Figure it out.

681
00:38:30,024 --> 00:38:32,185
What's the army death benefit pay,
ten grand?

682
00:38:32,326 --> 00:38:33,088
Yeah, about.

683
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,286
Okay. Well her husband
died in forty-four.

684
00:38:35,429 --> 00:38:38,887
She gets a part-time job,
lives off the death benefit.

685
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:42,433
That's the number.
That's what she had to steal.

686
00:38:43,704 --> 00:38:45,968
Still, it ain't murder.

687
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,164
Not yet.

688
00:38:55,883 --> 00:38:59,375
Well...
welcome home, Janette.

689
00:39:08,362 --> 00:39:09,886
I know it's not much
to look at, darling.

690
00:39:10,031 --> 00:39:11,555
It's one of my rentals.

691
00:39:16,037 --> 00:39:18,096
It's just
for a couple of nights.

692
00:39:18,572 --> 00:39:21,905
Look... we get our business out
of the way in the morning,

693
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,768
go to the church
in the afternoon,

694
00:39:25,646 --> 00:39:28,706
we'll be on our honeymoon...
by Tuesday.

695
00:39:30,484 --> 00:39:32,179
Is she coming with us?

696
00:39:32,586 --> 00:39:34,144
Who, Martha?

697
00:39:35,256 --> 00:39:36,917
She doesn't like me, Raymond.

698
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:39,553
Well how can you say that?
Martha likes everybody.

699
00:39:39,693 --> 00:39:40,591
She's a nurse.

700
00:39:40,728 --> 00:39:42,992
She didn't say a single thing to me,
the whole trip,

701
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,792
just glared at me
in the mirror.

702
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:52,495
Well, even if that were true,
it's none of our business, is it?

703
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:54,908
No it isn't.

704
00:39:55,876 --> 00:39:57,343
You need a hand?

705
00:39:57,511 --> 00:39:59,342
No, but I think the kitchen might.

706
00:39:59,513 --> 00:40:00,844
I'll take... care of it.

707
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:04,075
She's alone Janette.
You're a beautiful woman.

708
00:40:05,019 --> 00:40:11,447
You and me, we got each other.
She sees that.

709
00:40:13,194 --> 00:40:14,627
It's difficult.

710
00:40:14,962 --> 00:40:16,759
I hadrt thought
about it that way.

711
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,526
You want me to get her a hotel
for the night, I will. I will.

712
00:40:25,439 --> 00:40:27,703
Or maybe you and
I should go to a hotel, huh?

713
00:40:29,643 --> 00:40:31,110
That'd be fun.

714
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,142
I suppose I can take
it a while longer if she can.

715
00:40:35,282 --> 00:40:37,876
Mm. That's a good girl.

716
00:40:42,156 --> 00:40:48,425
Okay. We'll make it work.
No problems. Forget about her.

717
00:40:49,396 --> 00:40:52,194
It's you and me, kid.
Come on, let's get in there.

718
00:40:54,835 --> 00:40:56,166
Tea time.

719
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:02,300
Janette, lemon, honey?

720
00:41:04,445 --> 00:41:05,935
Nothing. No thank you.

721
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,445
How 'bout you, Ray?

722
00:41:07,915 --> 00:41:09,348
You want honey?

723
00:41:12,253 --> 00:41:14,084
I wanted to surprise you.

724
00:41:17,324 --> 00:41:18,655
That's wonderful.

725
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:20,282
Martha, find some tools.
We'll hang it up.

726
00:41:20,427 --> 00:41:22,292
You're gonna... ruin him.

727
00:41:35,609 --> 00:41:39,443
She's right, you know?
You're too good to me.

728
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:47,582
I'm- I'm cold.
I think I'll run a bath.

729
00:41:48,689 --> 00:41:53,683
Why don't you give me a
few minutes and sneak in with me?

730
00:41:54,528 --> 00:41:57,964
Okay.
I'll see ya soon.

731
00:42:11,412 --> 00:42:12,208
Ray?

732
00:42:12,346 --> 00:42:13,813
It's all right.

733
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,714
There, you do it.

734
00:42:16,717 --> 00:42:18,184
What the hell is wrong with you?

735
00:42:18,552 --> 00:42:19,484
Excuse me?

736
00:42:19,653 --> 00:42:21,746
Are you trying to blow this?

737
00:42:22,022 --> 00:42:23,284
What are you talking about?

738
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:26,017
You are driving her crazy.

739
00:42:26,193 --> 00:42:29,788
Staring at her in the car.
God damn tea?

740
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:31,557
You want me to
send you to a hotel?

741
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:32,631
How dare you.

742
00:42:32,766 --> 00:42:35,234
I've been so nice to that old cow.

743
00:42:35,369 --> 00:42:38,167
And you two have been treating
me like the fucking maid.

744
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:40,068
I'm not gonna put up
with it, Ray.

745
00:42:40,341 --> 00:42:42,206
We are getting out
of here right now.

746
00:42:42,343 --> 00:42:43,935
We don't have the money,
Martha.

747
00:42:44,078 --> 00:42:45,602
Ray.

748
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,808
It's alright, it's alright.
In a minute.

749
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:51,508
What... about that other girl,
the one from Michigan...

750
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:52,846
the one with the kid?

751
00:42:53,053 --> 00:42:53,849
That's the real money.

752
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:56,081
We don't... need this whore.
Let's... leave right now.

753
00:42:56,223 --> 00:42:58,282
Are you listening to
anything that I'm... saying?

754
00:42:58,959 --> 00:43:00,017
Anything?

755
00:43:00,461 --> 00:43:04,830
All of our cash, all of it,
is in her bank account.

756
00:43:05,733 --> 00:43:09,430
Ray, I... don't care
about the money.

757
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:13,133
Look, sit down.
Sit down for a second.

758
00:43:14,908 --> 00:43:16,842
The checks clear
Monday morning.

759
00:43:16,977 --> 00:43:18,205
Okay?
Monday morning.

760
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:19,812
- Baby.
- It'll be all over.

761
00:43:19,947 --> 00:43:22,415
- Baby, I can't wait 'til Monday.
- I promise, it'll all be over.

762
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:23,875
Come on.

763
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,076
That's enough.

764
00:43:25,219 --> 00:43:29,087
Please, let's just get out of here.
Come on. Let's go.

765
00:43:29,223 --> 00:43:31,714
- You got such a fire, baby...
- Come on.

766
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,326
You put it out with this.

767
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:38,520
But I'm not leaving without my money.
Got it?

768
00:43:58,018 --> 00:43:59,246
You need any help?

769
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,852
Yeah. Keep that dog out of here.
There's glue all over.

770
00:44:01,955 --> 00:44:07,484
Skip. Skipper. Skipper.
Skipper, come on. Come on, boy.

771
00:44:11,332 --> 00:44:14,733
Here uh, I got...

772
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:16,998
What's that?

773
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:19,637
Billy G's... paying me
a dollar and a half a week.

774
00:44:19,773 --> 00:44:20,933
What for?

775
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:23,866
On account of he's got...
uh, football practice,

776
00:44:24,011 --> 00:44:26,571
doesn't wanna lose
his paper route, so.

777
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,340
Why aren't you
playing football?

778
00:44:30,384 --> 00:44:31,942
Gotta pitch papers.

779
00:44:33,821 --> 00:44:36,449
Well it's gonna take a lot of papers to...
pay for that fender.

780
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:37,716
I know.

781
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:47,767
Why don't ya pick up a block...
help me. Go 'head.

782
00:44:50,571 --> 00:44:51,902
Wipe it down with this.

783
00:45:01,682 --> 00:45:03,775
Tell me you love me, baby.

784
00:45:04,885 --> 00:45:06,910
I want to hear you say it.

785
00:45:08,589 --> 00:45:09,851
Yeah, sure.

786
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:11,150
Say my name.

787
00:45:12,192 --> 00:45:13,591
What are you talking about?

788
00:45:13,994 --> 00:45:15,291
My name.

789
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,128
Say my name.

790
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,861
Come on. Janette.

791
00:45:24,004 --> 00:45:26,802
Say I, I love you.

792
00:45:31,712 --> 00:45:33,339
I love you Kitty Cat.

793
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,639
I do. Come on.

794
00:45:37,851 --> 00:45:39,375
Oo!

795
00:45:40,754 --> 00:45:42,119
Oh my god.

796
00:45:43,123 --> 00:45:43,953
Oh...

797
00:45:44,091 --> 00:45:45,217
Jesus Christ!

798
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:46,917
You trying to drive...
me crazy?

799
00:45:47,127 --> 00:45:49,391
Do you enjoy...
playing with my heart like this, huh?

800
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:50,656
Hurting me like this?

801
00:45:50,798 --> 00:45:53,824
No... baby, no.
I was just working.

802
00:45:54,134 --> 00:45:57,535
Son of a bitch!
You called... her my name!

803
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,002
You called her fucking...

804
00:45:59,139 --> 00:46:00,538
- No-no-no-no.
- My...

805
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:01,800
No.

806
00:46:01,942 --> 00:46:02,966
I... heard you.

807
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:05,510
My eyes...
were closed, Kitty Cat.

808
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:07,775
I was with you.
Don't you see?

809
00:46:07,915 --> 00:46:10,247
The only way
I could do it was to see you.

810
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:13,114
I'm always with... you.

811
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:17,123
I'm always with you.
I'm always...

812
00:46:18,826 --> 00:46:20,953
Yeah. Mm-hm.

813
00:46:21,228 --> 00:46:22,718
I love you, Ray.

814
00:46:31,071 --> 00:46:32,299
Oh, yeah.

815
00:46:35,309 --> 00:46:37,038
Mm, Kitty Cat.

816
00:46:37,244 --> 00:46:39,144
No, no baby, no.

817
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,947
No-no-no,
wait-wait-wait-wait-wait.

818
00:46:41,081 --> 00:46:42,844
Wait.
Don't stop, Kitty Cat.

819
00:46:42,983 --> 00:46:45,008
- No let me...
- Don't stop.

820
00:46:45,185 --> 00:46:46,516
No.

821
00:46:47,321 --> 00:46:49,255
Close your eyes now.

822
00:46:49,823 --> 00:46:51,518
And finish yourself.

823
00:46:53,026 --> 00:46:55,517
I want to see you see me.

824
00:46:56,263 --> 00:47:01,599
And Raymond...
if you're lying, I'll know.

825
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:05,070
I'll see your heart.

826
00:47:16,116 --> 00:47:18,778
Baby. Close your eyes.

827
00:47:31,164 --> 00:47:35,328
Oh, god Martha,
you made such a mess.

828
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,301
Oh, Martha.

829
00:47:50,884 --> 00:47:53,614
Rene.
What're you doir here?

830
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:55,284
You shouldn't be here.

831
00:47:55,422 --> 00:48:01,361
No. No.
You never answer your phone, and...

832
00:48:01,662 --> 00:48:03,823
I try to get you, you show...
up in the middle of the night.

833
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:04,862
- Oh...
- And when something happens,

834
00:48:04,998 --> 00:48:06,124
I don't know how to get a hold...
of you.

835
00:48:06,266 --> 00:48:06,994
What happened?

836
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,158
My father.

837
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,326
What?

838
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:10,834
My dad died.

839
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,232
I just need you to hold me.

840
00:48:15,876 --> 00:48:18,071
I found him in the kitchen.

841
00:48:20,681 --> 00:48:22,171
My daddy.

842
00:48:22,749 --> 00:48:24,512
Come on, let's- let's...
go inside.

843
00:48:27,521 --> 00:48:28,783
Where is he now?

844
00:48:29,923 --> 00:48:31,185
Dad.

845
00:48:31,692 --> 00:48:33,091
Eddie, don't.

846
00:48:35,896 --> 00:48:36,954
Eddie.

847
00:48:38,398 --> 00:48:39,660
Eddie.

848
00:48:54,615 --> 00:48:56,014
You're gonna break it.

849
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,609
Well she don't fit.

850
00:49:01,221 --> 00:49:02,745
I'll make her fit.

851
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:11,120
The bitch won't die.

852
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,540
Why'd she do it?

853
00:49:30,751 --> 00:49:32,116
Was it because...
of that woman?

854
00:49:32,252 --> 00:49:33,344
No.

855
00:49:34,121 --> 00:49:36,555
Though I can't say at the time
I didn't think about it.

856
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:38,719
Well I guess
you got what you wanted.

857
00:49:39,626 --> 00:49:41,093
You...
have no idea what I want.

858
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,093
Then why don't you...
explain it to me.

859
00:49:47,434 --> 00:49:48,731
'Cause you can't.

860
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:18,019
Holster your weapons.

861
00:50:18,999 --> 00:50:20,296
You're... gonna love this.

862
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,799
Missing Persons blotter.

863
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:22,867
Lady says
her mother disappeared

864
00:50:23,003 --> 00:50:24,368
three days ago
with two characters that...

865
00:50:24,504 --> 00:50:26,131
sound like our friends
from Wantaugh.

866
00:50:26,873 --> 00:50:28,101
Off to Florida.

867
00:50:28,308 --> 00:50:29,673
Cleared out her bank account.

868
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:31,002
Ray Martin?

869
00:50:31,378 --> 00:50:34,211
It's gotta be.
It's also gotta be an alias.

870
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:40,679
Coffee?

871
00:50:41,054 --> 00:50:43,045
No, no-no, after.

872
00:50:52,766 --> 00:50:54,131
We need to talk.

873
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:56,333
About what?

874
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:58,032
About us.

875
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,903
I think about the future,
Raymond.

876
00:51:02,442 --> 00:51:04,171
Planning...
the future, huh?

877
00:51:05,445 --> 00:51:06,935
See, there you go again.

878
00:51:08,115 --> 00:51:10,879
There I go what? Hm?

879
00:51:11,852 --> 00:51:13,911
I'm trying to talk about something
that's important to me,

880
00:51:14,054 --> 00:51:17,148
something that means something.
And you get sarcastic.

881
00:51:17,524 --> 00:51:22,052
Look, I'm tired.
Okay? I'm sorry.

882
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:26,058
What do you wanna talk about?
Come here.

883
00:51:30,604 --> 00:51:31,798
Let's talk.

884
00:51:32,139 --> 00:51:33,071
Don't laugh.

885
00:51:33,206 --> 00:51:35,333
Mm... I promise.

886
00:51:39,446 --> 00:51:40,879
I want a baby.

887
00:51:43,283 --> 00:51:44,580
A baby?

888
00:51:44,718 --> 00:51:46,982
I don't wanna be alone the...
rest of my life.

889
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,712
Babies don't leave.

890
00:51:52,626 --> 00:51:53,888
I'd like that.

891
00:51:53,994 --> 00:51:55,359
Don't bullshit me, Raymond.

892
00:51:55,495 --> 00:51:56,985
No, I would...
like that.

893
00:51:59,432 --> 00:52:05,803
You know, to have a boy, a son,

894
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:09,941
I could take the track,
ballgames or something.

895
00:52:11,978 --> 00:52:13,468
Or maybe a little girl,

896
00:52:14,147 --> 00:52:18,277
I could buy dresses for,
little shoes, dolls.

897
00:52:18,518 --> 00:52:21,009
My own little princess
who calls me Daddy.

898
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,582
What's not to like?

899
00:52:29,029 --> 00:52:30,360
You mean that?

900
00:52:30,497 --> 00:52:31,759
Of course I mean it.

901
00:52:32,465 --> 00:52:33,659
We'd... have to get
the hell outta here, though.

902
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,768
City's no place to raise a kid.

903
00:52:36,336 --> 00:52:37,860
No. Too many creeps.

904
00:52:42,976 --> 00:52:47,640
Yeah. Well Kitty Cat, we get our
business out of the way, we'll be set.

905
00:52:48,448 --> 00:52:50,109
Get some money socked away,

906
00:52:50,984 --> 00:52:53,452
get a place upriver,
Croton or Hastings.

907
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:56,983
We can do anything.
We can do whatever we want.

908
00:52:57,557 --> 00:52:59,957
I'll put a bun in the oven,
we'll be on our way.

909
00:53:01,528 --> 00:53:02,756
What's the matter?
What did I say?

910
00:53:02,896 --> 00:53:06,059
What did I do now?
What's the matter?

911
00:53:08,301 --> 00:53:11,566
I'm crying because I'm happy.

912
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:25,716
That's your mother?

913
00:53:25,852 --> 00:53:26,876
Yeah.

914
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:27,816
How old is she?

915
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:29,182
Fifty-three.

916
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:31,950
Yeah.
How long they been together?

917
00:53:32,259 --> 00:53:33,726
About three months.

918
00:53:34,594 --> 00:53:35,993
Big age difference, huh?

919
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:36,618
Yeah.

920
00:53:36,763 --> 00:53:37,889
Yeah.

921
00:53:38,398 --> 00:53:42,630
Says here she's happy, she eloped,
she'll call you when she gets settled.

922
00:53:42,936 --> 00:53:43,834
What's wrong with that?

923
00:53:43,904 --> 00:53:45,337
It's not her writing.

924
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:49,233
Well you mean, you uh, actually
positive that that's not her writing?

925
00:53:49,376 --> 00:53:50,434
Yeah.

926
00:53:51,211 --> 00:53:53,873
How 'bout money?
Did your mother have money?

927
00:53:54,247 --> 00:53:56,613
Around five thousand,
plus a house.

928
00:53:56,716 --> 00:53:58,547
Yeah? You check with the bank?

929
00:53:58,685 --> 00:54:01,051
The house was sold.
She cleared out all the accounts.

930
00:54:02,289 --> 00:54:04,223
How 'bout uh, this guy,
you ever seen him?

931
00:54:04,357 --> 00:54:04,982
Met him?

932
00:54:05,125 --> 00:54:06,422
Yeah.

933
00:54:06,593 --> 00:54:08,151
How 'bout his sister,
she ever around?

934
00:54:08,295 --> 00:54:14,996
She don't like me very much.
Listen, this ain't right.

935
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:20,864
The suspect in the photograph goes
by the name of Raymond Martin.

936
00:54:21,241 --> 00:54:24,369
The woman standing next to
him is the missing person.

937
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,445
Her name is Janette Long.

938
00:54:26,947 --> 00:54:31,145
Apparently he travels with a uh,
woman who claims that she's his sister.

939
00:54:31,418 --> 00:54:33,477
We don't know much
about her other than uh...

940
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:35,611
she's romantically linked to Martin.

941
00:54:38,825 --> 00:54:40,725
If you've got any information
or you see anything,

942
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,226
you know, let... us know.

943
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:47,230
Thank you for letting us
intrude on your precinct.

944
00:54:47,734 --> 00:54:48,792
Thank you.

945
00:54:56,776 --> 00:55:01,110
Excuse me. Excuse me.
You didn't look at the picture.

946
00:55:01,281 --> 00:55:02,475
Yeah, sure I did.

947
00:55:03,249 --> 00:55:04,511
Can I show you something?

948
00:55:06,519 --> 00:55:07,850
I mean you gotta ask yourself...

949
00:55:07,988 --> 00:55:11,424
why would a beautiful girl hop
in a tub and do that to herself?

950
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:13,986
You know what I think, Officer...

951
00:55:14,694 --> 00:55:15,991
Chetnick?

952
00:55:16,296 --> 00:55:16,990
I think that these two...

953
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:19,223
barnacles figured out
that she was alone,

954
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:20,692
and that
she was getting money from

955
00:55:20,834 --> 00:55:24,395
her dead hero husband
and a GI insurance policy.

956
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:28,431
A beautiful girl
with a baby inside her.

957
00:55:31,644 --> 00:55:33,771
Take a look.
Take another look.

958
00:55:37,817 --> 00:55:38,442
Excuse me.

959
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:39,074
You know...

960
00:55:39,219 --> 00:55:40,345
this is kind of a heartache.

961
00:55:40,487 --> 00:55:42,921
You know, maybe the only way to
resolve it is with a razor blade.

962
00:55:44,524 --> 00:55:48,119
But they're gonna do it again,
and it could even be in your backyard.

963
00:55:48,795 --> 00:55:50,126
How are you gonna live with that?

964
00:56:03,176 --> 00:56:04,404
What the hell was that?

965
00:56:04,544 --> 00:56:05,602
I don't know.

966
00:56:06,713 --> 00:56:08,840
Call a hotel 'cause
I'm not flying in this shit.

967
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,040
It's ridiculous.

968
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:12,308
Where d'you keep your balls,
in a fucking safe?

969
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,780
You know, you're right,
let's be daring and see what happens.

970
00:56:15,021 --> 00:56:15,885
Try it out.

971
00:56:16,022 --> 00:56:17,216
All right,
it's raining a little bit.

972
00:56:17,357 --> 00:56:18,289
A little bit?

973
00:56:18,425 --> 00:56:19,687
Let's stand here.

974
00:56:23,696 --> 00:56:25,129
Detective Robinson.

975
00:56:34,207 --> 00:56:36,334
I pulled 'em over
on a possible DUI.

976
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:39,138
Don't know if they're your pair or not.
The guy was bald.

977
00:56:39,279 --> 00:56:40,712
He might've wore a rug, though.

978
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:41,912
How do you know that?

979
00:56:42,048 --> 00:56:44,039
Tape on his dome, you know?
Double stick.

980
00:56:44,184 --> 00:56:45,811
I thought that
was kind of screwy.

981
00:56:50,123 --> 00:56:51,021
Did you run this?

982
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:52,852
Didrt have to.
He wasrt drunk.

983
00:56:54,094 --> 00:56:55,789
Why didn't
you tell me this before?

984
00:56:56,062 --> 00:56:58,030
No. Out.
That's all you get.

985
00:56:58,298 --> 00:56:59,458
Right.

986
00:57:01,034 --> 00:57:02,399
I'll tell you this, though.

987
00:57:04,037 --> 00:57:06,164
The... sister that's with him,
she's crazy.

988
00:57:06,372 --> 00:57:06,861
How do you mean?

989
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:09,474
Unstable, you know?
Fucked up in the head.

990
00:57:11,277 --> 00:57:13,006
Wouldrt believe
a damn thing she says.

991
00:57:16,483 --> 00:57:17,814
Thanks.

992
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:23,454
Come on.

993
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,951
I got a name, I got a number.
Let's go.

994
00:57:27,427 --> 00:57:28,394
Where you going?

995
00:57:28,962 --> 00:57:30,896
You know tonight is
the kind when accidents happen.

996
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:33,423
He's Raymond Martinez...

997
00:57:33,566 --> 00:57:36,831
Fernandez. Alias Ray Martin.
Alias Shit stick.

998
00:57:37,837 --> 00:57:41,000
Incarcerated Tallahassee
for burglary, larceny.

999
00:57:41,274 --> 00:57:42,969
Oh, did a year at
Bass Creek for polygamy.

1000
00:57:43,109 --> 00:57:44,235
No kidding.

1001
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:46,901
Married twice.
Jane Thompson.

1002
00:57:47,113 --> 00:57:49,843
She keeled over... of a heart
attack on the honeymoon in Spain.

1003
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:53,781
Second wife, Myrtle Young,
OD'd on Phenobarbital.

1004
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:56,385
Goes belly-up after they stick
her on a bus back to Little Rock.

1005
00:57:56,523 --> 00:57:57,649
The guy's... prolific.

1006
00:57:57,790 --> 00:57:58,518
Got an address?

1007
00:57:58,658 --> 00:58:01,058
Yeah. P.O. Box in
Ansonia Station in Manattan.

1008
00:58:01,361 --> 00:58:02,589
Big spender.

1009
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:04,256
This is good.

1010
00:58:05,698 --> 00:58:08,326
Well, we'll need a warrant.
Get the Leprechaun on it.

1011
00:58:08,468 --> 00:58:09,662
Reilly!

1012
00:58:24,684 --> 00:58:27,050
So you got uh, any idea how long

1013
00:58:27,187 --> 00:58:29,121
it's been since
this guy checked his mail?

1014
00:58:29,689 --> 00:58:30,713
Quite a while.

1015
00:58:31,157 --> 00:58:32,181
Check the postmarks.

1016
00:58:32,325 --> 00:58:33,587
What about this,
how's he pay for this?

1017
00:58:33,726 --> 00:58:35,887
Does he have
a billing address?

1018
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:37,528
Yeah, Detective.

1019
00:58:38,364 --> 00:58:39,422
Okay, what is it?

1020
00:58:39,532 --> 00:58:41,022
You're standing next to it.

1021
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:42,634
Uh, that's
why people have mailboxes,

1022
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,464
so that they...
can get their mail.

1023
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,731
You know, we should have
Eastman check electric... telephone.

1024
00:58:46,873 --> 00:58:48,067
There's gotta
be a trail on this guy.

1025
00:58:48,208 --> 00:58:49,573
- Right.
- Yeah.

1026
00:58:49,709 --> 00:58:51,643
Somebody's gotta stay
with the box though, right?

1027
00:58:52,412 --> 00:58:53,037
Yeah.

1028
00:58:53,179 --> 00:58:54,976
Yeah. Reilly, it's you.

1029
00:58:55,548 --> 00:58:56,310
What's me?

1030
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,781
Hold on, whoa-whoa-whoa,
whoa-whoa, hey... come on.

1031
00:58:59,052 --> 00:59:00,679
I'm not staying
with the fucking...

1032
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:02,478
Stay with the box!

1033
00:59:02,922 --> 00:59:04,321
I haven't even had my lunch.

1034
00:59:05,158 --> 00:59:06,386
Alright.

1035
00:59:09,362 --> 00:59:10,693
Come on, you idiot.

1036
00:59:10,863 --> 00:59:12,091
Going!

1037
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:13,564
What?

1038
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:16,601
What? I'm a little up
to here from him.

1039
00:59:18,838 --> 00:59:22,137
All first names.
P.O. Boxes from all over.

1040
00:59:22,275 --> 00:59:25,506
Meredith from Deluth.
Sally from Wheaton.

1041
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:28,177
But this is shit.
We can't take this to the D.A.

1042
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:30,839
Well just keep looking.
Don't come in here with bad news.

1043
00:59:31,584 --> 00:59:33,552
Well do you know how many
spic-ass Fernandez motherfuckers

1044
00:59:33,686 --> 00:59:35,449
there are on the
Con Edison rolls?

1045
00:59:36,623 --> 00:59:37,612
No, how many?

1046
00:59:37,757 --> 00:59:39,088
Thousands.

1047
00:59:39,959 --> 00:59:42,894
You wanna know how many Raymond
Martinez Fernandezes there are?

1048
00:59:43,029 --> 00:59:44,360
Put us out of our misery.

1049
00:59:45,231 --> 00:59:52,069
Just one. In Valley Stream.
Out by the airport.

1050
00:59:52,205 --> 00:59:53,229
No kidding.

1051
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,276
- All right.
- Let's go.

1052
00:59:58,778 --> 01:00:02,942
He even paid his bill.
What a fuckir idiot.

1053
01:00:06,653 --> 01:00:08,177
- Gonna knock, right?
- Right.

1054
01:00:23,403 --> 01:00:24,495
We're in!

1055
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,034
Bathroom's clean.

1056
01:00:30,743 --> 01:00:31,971
Nobody in the kitchen.

1057
01:00:32,645 --> 01:00:34,044
They've gone.
They skinned out.

1058
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:35,306
We just missed 'em.

1059
01:00:35,448 --> 01:00:36,506
How do you know that?

1060
01:00:36,683 --> 01:00:37,775
Look, there's food on the table.

1061
01:00:37,917 --> 01:00:39,384
The lights are on.
The heat's on.

1062
01:00:39,519 --> 01:00:42,249
Check the milk outside.
Pay attention.

1063
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,451
They could still be upstate,
for all we know.

1064
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:45,880
Or in Lauderdale by now.

1065
01:00:46,025 --> 01:00:47,458
Maybe...
they're on the fuckir moon.

1066
01:00:47,593 --> 01:00:49,083
Hey, check
the god damn basement.

1067
01:00:49,429 --> 01:00:50,418
Go.

1068
01:00:50,596 --> 01:00:51,722
Come on.

1069
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:54,499
Come here.

1070
01:00:54,634 --> 01:00:55,999
We have to check the basement.

1071
01:00:56,502 --> 01:00:58,026
Thought... we were gonna knock.

1072
01:00:58,171 --> 01:00:59,468
You did.

1073
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:01,430
What's your problem?

1074
01:01:01,541 --> 01:01:02,565
You. You're my problem.

1075
01:01:02,709 --> 01:01:03,266
I'm your problem?

1076
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:05,843
Yeah. It's like you don't
wanna catch bad guys anymore.

1077
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:07,709
Yeah, I do.
But I'm a homicide cop.

1078
01:01:07,847 --> 01:01:08,814
This is bunko all the way.

1079
01:01:08,948 --> 01:01:11,439
That's not what I'm talking about.
I'm talking about your coasting.

1080
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:13,779
You're talking about poker,
you're talking about pension.

1081
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:14,852
Like you don't give a shit.

1082
01:01:14,987 --> 01:01:16,079
Oh I give a shit.

1083
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:19,554
Grand larceny, polygamy,
incest, maybe.

1084
01:01:19,692 --> 01:01:21,216
They're all Ionely hearts.
Who gives a shit?

1085
01:01:21,361 --> 01:01:23,329
She's probably sucking on
a coconut in Florida right now.

1086
01:01:23,463 --> 01:01:25,693
This homicide thing
is all in your head.

1087
01:01:25,832 --> 01:01:27,891
It- it's a zero.
It's all fiction.

1088
01:01:28,034 --> 01:01:28,625
- Really?
- Yeah.

1089
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:29,894
Then why is MacSwain all over it?

1090
01:01:30,036 --> 01:01:32,732
And if I'm so screwed up,
why did they put you on it, huh?

1091
01:01:32,872 --> 01:01:34,840
Well I think
that question answers itself.

1092
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:39,100
You better get down here.

1093
01:02:08,841 --> 01:02:12,641
Spatter on the walls, blood,
bone, brains, but no bullet.

1094
01:02:12,779 --> 01:02:14,144
Soap underneath the baseboard.

1095
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:15,474
They thinned it out
when they cleaned up.

1096
01:02:15,615 --> 01:02:16,639
But no body.

1097
01:02:16,783 --> 01:02:17,613
Sure there is.

1098
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:20,241
Somewhere.
It's a total bleed-out.

1099
01:02:21,187 --> 01:02:21,949
Who's this?

1100
01:02:22,088 --> 01:02:23,180
It's the landlord.

1101
01:02:24,223 --> 01:02:25,451
Whers the last time you saw 'em?

1102
01:02:26,292 --> 01:02:26,917
Speak English.

1103
01:02:27,059 --> 01:02:29,493
I already told him.
Now who's going to pay for my floor?

1104
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:30,594
Three days ago.

1105
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:32,755
Son of a bitch, he had lease...
with me.

1106
01:02:32,932 --> 01:02:35,332
I make out, though.
Fifty... dollar deposit.

1107
01:02:35,468 --> 01:02:37,868
Good.
You can pay for it yourself.

1108
01:02:39,872 --> 01:02:41,305
Albany make... the car?

1109
01:02:41,441 --> 01:02:44,205
Yeah. Forty-seven Plymouth.
Stolen.

1110
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:46,607
Probably switches plates
every time he winds his watch.

1111
01:02:46,746 --> 01:02:48,941
What about my door, huh?

1112
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:52,175
Think we're goir.

1113
01:02:52,885 --> 01:02:54,011
Get outta the way.

1114
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:55,819
Hey buddy.

1115
01:02:57,089 --> 01:02:59,580
Now everything matches...
you stupid piece of shit.

1116
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:01,993
You got any more questions?

1117
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:06,592
We just missed 'em.

1118
01:03:06,833 --> 01:03:10,667
They were only five miles away
buying a Desoto flop top in Seaford.

1119
01:03:11,137 --> 01:03:12,934
But they might as
well have been on the moon.

1120
01:03:13,973 --> 01:03:17,602
We were so close,
but we lost 'em.

1121
01:03:19,111 --> 01:03:20,601
And it all went cold.

1122
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,195
Hello.

1123
01:03:44,804 --> 01:03:45,771
I'm Ray.

1124
01:03:45,938 --> 01:03:47,098
I... know.

1125
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:53,945
Uh, this is my daughter,
Rainelle.

1126
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,277
Hello Rainelle.

1127
01:03:56,782 --> 01:03:58,579
This is a picture I made.
This is...

1128
01:03:58,718 --> 01:04:01,812
Mommy, this is me,
and this is... you.

1129
01:04:03,022 --> 01:04:04,011
How about that.

1130
01:04:04,156 --> 01:04:05,646
You're so talented.

1131
01:04:06,192 --> 01:04:07,284
Oh.

1132
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:09,391
Thank you.

1133
01:04:09,662 --> 01:04:10,754
Can I show you my... room?

1134
01:04:10,897 --> 01:04:12,228
Of course you can.

1135
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:18,227
Is it this way, right?
Okay.

1136
01:04:20,907 --> 01:04:22,169
Do you have any pets, huh?

1137
01:04:22,308 --> 01:04:22,831
Um...

1138
01:04:22,975 --> 01:04:25,000
Little frog or something,
perhaps?

1139
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,475
You must be Martha.

1140
01:04:29,782 --> 01:04:31,773
Nice to meet you, Delphine.

1141
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:34,317
It... means so much to me
that you give up your nursing job,

1142
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:35,920
you come all the
way here with Ray.

1143
01:04:36,055 --> 01:04:37,818
Please.

1144
01:04:38,224 --> 01:04:39,851
Let me look at you.

1145
01:04:42,862 --> 01:04:44,796
So pretty.

1146
01:05:03,583 --> 01:05:07,542
It's okay, boy. It's okay.
You're fine. Okay...

1147
01:05:08,588 --> 01:05:10,021
Oh, you got one.

1148
01:05:10,756 --> 01:05:11,723
Yeah.

1149
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:15,390
You caught all those?

1150
01:05:15,528 --> 01:05:16,495
Yup.

1151
01:05:17,063 --> 01:05:18,860
Dog doesn't like 'em.
Do you, now?

1152
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,090
Come here, Skip.

1153
01:05:20,266 --> 01:05:21,392
It's okay.

1154
01:05:26,205 --> 01:05:27,433
Watch out.

1155
01:05:33,379 --> 01:05:35,176
Sorry about your dad.

1156
01:05:36,048 --> 01:05:37,345
Thank you.

1157
01:05:41,921 --> 01:05:43,548
Did you uh, wanna... try?

1158
01:05:45,324 --> 01:05:46,621
- Sure.
- It's- it's easy.

1159
01:05:46,759 --> 01:05:47,691
Alright.

1160
01:05:49,261 --> 01:05:52,355
Take the rope...
it's kind of... Pick that up and...

1161
01:05:52,498 --> 01:05:53,556
It's getting worn.

1162
01:06:06,579 --> 01:06:07,443
Good afternoon.

1163
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:08,706
What the hell you doing?

1164
01:06:09,348 --> 01:06:11,612
Boiling crabs.
What's it look like?

1165
01:06:12,084 --> 01:06:13,745
No, what the hell's
she doing here?

1166
01:06:15,254 --> 01:06:17,745
I invited the squad.
She's part of the... squad.

1167
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:19,915
She's talking to my son,
for Christ's sake.

1168
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:21,284
So what?

1169
01:06:21,694 --> 01:06:22,854
Well, he don't understand.

1170
01:06:22,995 --> 01:06:24,394
Maybe you should explain it
to him.

1171
01:06:24,864 --> 01:06:26,456
Then maybe you should
explain it to me.

1172
01:06:26,832 --> 01:06:29,960
Look, who I'm banging...
he doesn't need to know about.

1173
01:06:30,202 --> 01:06:33,103
- Nice. Thank you very much.
- Rene, look, he's fifteen.

1174
01:06:33,673 --> 01:06:34,435
How am I supposed to say

1175
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:36,803
I'm- I'm with a woman
that's not his mother, huh?

1176
01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:39,776
You don't need to say it.
He already knows you're banging me.

1177
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:41,641
Ida knows you're banging me.
Everybody knows.

1178
01:06:41,781 --> 01:06:43,146
Well you know, they do now.

1179
01:06:43,282 --> 01:06:44,078
So what's your problem?

1180
01:06:44,216 --> 01:06:45,513
I don't got a problem.

1181
01:06:45,818 --> 01:06:47,149
Sure you do.

1182
01:06:49,455 --> 01:06:51,446
You wanna know what I think?

1183
01:06:52,825 --> 01:06:56,022
I think your son hasn't cried
yet 'cause he's waiting for you to.

1184
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:00,892
You know everything, don't ya?

1185
01:07:03,169 --> 01:07:07,936
Oh come on.
It doesn't have to be that hard, okay?

1186
01:07:12,845 --> 01:07:13,834
All right.

1187
01:07:45,277 --> 01:07:46,244
It's me.

1188
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:48,306
Why don't you come over.

1189
01:07:49,515 --> 01:07:51,483
No. Now.

1190
01:07:52,251 --> 01:07:53,912
I know this son of a bitch.

1191
01:07:54,186 --> 01:07:55,448
And he ain't happy.

1192
01:07:56,655 --> 01:07:58,213
This is
why I'm here on a Sunday?

1193
01:07:58,357 --> 01:08:00,518
Yeah, shit bags don't keep...
store hours, Charlie.

1194
01:08:00,726 --> 01:08:02,353
Yeah, and the dead'II...
still be dead in the morning.

1195
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:04,690
He's fleecing women,
having the good life.

1196
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:07,390
Cars, money.
He loved his life.

1197
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:11,366
Then suddenly he's banging the sister
on his girlfriend's kitchen table?

1198
01:08:12,471 --> 01:08:14,234
Blood in the...
bathtub, blood in the floorboards.

1199
01:08:14,373 --> 01:08:15,840
Who knows where else?

1200
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:16,736
It's a mess.

1201
01:08:16,876 --> 01:08:18,309
Maybe she ain't his sister.

1202
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:23,972
Maybe she's one of his marks or,
maybe she's got her claws into him.

1203
01:08:24,116 --> 01:08:25,743
Yeah, that's...
what I was thinking.

1204
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:29,719
Can't keep a guy like that down,
not for long.

1205
01:08:30,122 --> 01:08:32,386
He's restless.
He wants... his life back.

1206
01:08:33,058 --> 01:08:34,923
He's gonna try to dump her,
and when he does,

1207
01:08:35,594 --> 01:08:37,255
Hell's coming home
for Christmas.

1208
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:50,570
- You're such a sweet little girl.
- Thank you.

1209
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:53,371
- This is the life. Huh, kid?
- Yeah.

1210
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:58,816
Who ever thought he'd take
a shine to babies.

1211
01:09:01,153 --> 01:09:04,782
It's really wonderful.
They've really taken to each other.

1212
01:09:04,924 --> 01:09:11,261
You know?
She never met her real father.

1213
01:09:11,597 --> 01:09:12,894
No?

1214
01:09:14,099 --> 01:09:18,058
I resigned myself that it's
just going to be me and her.

1215
01:09:21,774 --> 01:09:24,242
I am so grateful
to you and Ray.

1216
01:09:27,613 --> 01:09:29,046
Thank you.

1217
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:38,120
I know little girl who needs nap.

1218
01:09:38,824 --> 01:09:40,655
I know a little boy who needs a nap.

1219
01:09:40,893 --> 01:09:42,360
Right now, young lady.

1220
01:09:42,561 --> 01:09:43,755
Mommy.

1221
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:46,188
Alright now, be a good girl.

1222
01:09:46,332 --> 01:09:49,563
Oo, my god.
You weigh a million pounds.

1223
01:09:55,674 --> 01:09:57,972
Oh Ray, will you go to market
like you... said?

1224
01:09:58,110 --> 01:09:59,600
The list is on the counter.

1225
01:09:59,712 --> 01:10:00,872
Okay Mommy.

1226
01:10:03,482 --> 01:10:05,313
Well-well-well.

1227
01:10:05,417 --> 01:10:05,849
Yeah.

1228
01:10:05,985 --> 01:10:07,646
Isn't this rich?

1229
01:10:07,786 --> 01:10:09,276
Don't get to liking
it too much, Raymond.

1230
01:10:09,421 --> 01:10:11,286
You never know
when things will change.

1231
01:10:11,557 --> 01:10:13,548
Yeah?
Well maybe I'm ready for a change.

1232
01:10:13,692 --> 01:10:15,717
You Bette Crocker and the brat?

1233
01:10:16,228 --> 01:10:17,286
I can see it all.

1234
01:10:17,429 --> 01:10:19,920
You out there building
a picket fence,

1235
01:10:20,065 --> 01:10:21,999
waving to the folks
in the neighborhood,

1236
01:10:22,134 --> 01:10:23,396
sticking the fucking...

1237
01:10:23,535 --> 01:10:25,594
star on top of the
Christmas tree. Hm?

1238
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:27,833
That'll be something,
all right.

1239
01:10:28,274 --> 01:10:29,502
Maybe it would.

1240
01:10:32,344 --> 01:10:35,939
You'd be out of your mind inside
a week begging me to come back.

1241
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:41,483
But, the real problem here,
Raymond...

1242
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:47,252
the real reason this could never work
is the simple fact that you are no good.

1243
01:10:47,726 --> 01:10:51,025
You are no damn good.

1244
01:10:57,870 --> 01:10:59,929
Don't forget to go to market.

1245
01:11:17,723 --> 01:11:20,055
I'm sorry, but I forgot
to put the cereal in the bag.

1246
01:11:21,093 --> 01:11:22,924
I sure don't want your
little one going hungry.

1247
01:11:23,429 --> 01:11:25,294
I sure appreciate that.

1248
01:11:29,401 --> 01:11:30,663
I like your car.

1249
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:54,052
What is the matter with you?

1250
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:05,836
I'm sick like dog.

1251
01:12:06,005 --> 01:12:07,233
Is it the food?

1252
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:08,634
Oh, no.

1253
01:12:09,208 --> 01:12:10,607
It's me.

1254
01:12:12,011 --> 01:12:15,469
Ten minutes after I get pregnant,
my body lets me know.

1255
01:12:22,855 --> 01:12:27,554
The only thing that makes me feel
better is the cool of the tile.

1256
01:12:28,293 --> 01:12:30,352
Oh, thank god for it.

1257
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:34,090
I was down for...
two months with Rainelle.

1258
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,670
Don't be angry with us, Martha.

1259
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:44,971
I wanted... to tell you but Raymond,
he wanted it to be surprise.

1260
01:12:45,978 --> 01:12:47,036
Raymond?

1261
01:12:47,513 --> 01:12:49,276
He wants us
to go out and celebrate,

1262
01:12:49,415 --> 01:12:54,910
but... between you and me,
I'm not up to it.

1263
01:12:55,054 --> 01:12:56,521
I can see that.

1264
01:12:58,190 --> 01:13:02,320
If it's a girl...
we're gonna name her Martha.

1265
01:13:03,362 --> 01:13:05,023
I made him promise.

1266
01:13:10,569 --> 01:13:12,799
Can I tell you something, Martha?

1267
01:13:14,206 --> 01:13:15,434
Tell me.

1268
01:13:16,742 --> 01:13:20,075
I know Raymond isn't exactly
who he say he is, you know.

1269
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,512
He like to tell the stories.

1270
01:13:25,017 --> 01:13:29,716
Doesrt matter to me,
because I have my little girl to raise

1271
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:32,756
and now I have the new baby.

1272
01:13:33,292 --> 01:13:35,055
I don't want to do it alone.

1273
01:13:37,129 --> 01:13:40,155
Rainelle,
she's crazy about him,

1274
01:13:40,799 --> 01:13:42,824
and... his heart
is in the right place.

1275
01:13:43,035 --> 01:13:44,229
You know?

1276
01:13:45,704 --> 01:13:52,200
I don't... know when it
happened but, I'm in love with him.

1277
01:14:12,097 --> 01:14:13,928
It's gonna be all right.

1278
01:14:19,638 --> 01:14:21,538
It's gonna be all right.

1279
01:14:23,175 --> 01:14:25,370
I'll get you something
for your stomach.

1280
01:14:25,511 --> 01:14:26,409
Oh.

1281
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:28,035
Remember, I'm a nurse.

1282
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:32,077
Okay.

1283
01:14:41,693 --> 01:14:42,955
Here.

1284
01:14:45,097 --> 01:14:46,860
This will make you feel better.

1285
01:14:48,534 --> 01:14:51,196
Put your feet up.
Put your feet up.

1286
01:14:53,705 --> 01:14:55,332
I'll get you a pillow.

1287
01:14:56,542 --> 01:14:58,134
Thank you, Martha.

1288
01:15:36,748 --> 01:15:38,340
Mommy!

1289
01:15:39,151 --> 01:15:40,379
Delphine?

1290
01:15:40,519 --> 01:15:43,784
Mommy. I want my mommy!

1291
01:15:44,089 --> 01:15:46,023
Martha?

1292
01:15:50,996 --> 01:15:52,657
Is that for me, baby?

1293
01:15:56,235 --> 01:15:57,600
Delphine?

1294
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,638
You knocked her up.

1295
01:16:04,476 --> 01:16:05,704
Ray.

1296
01:16:06,044 --> 01:16:07,443
Ray.

1297
01:16:10,382 --> 01:16:12,213
What did you do to her?

1298
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:14,445
The baby.

1299
01:16:14,686 --> 01:16:16,244
What's wrong with her!

1300
01:16:16,388 --> 01:16:17,218
Mommy!

1301
01:16:17,356 --> 01:16:19,790
If you don't love me
then I don't wanna live.

1302
01:16:20,392 --> 01:16:23,759
Do it.
Prove that you don't love me, hm?

1303
01:16:24,229 --> 01:16:27,130
Oh, come on, baby.
You want out.

1304
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,958
I'll help you.
We'll do it together.

1305
01:16:30,102 --> 01:16:32,536
Alright?
Just... squeeze it.

1306
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:33,467
Stop it.

1307
01:16:33,605 --> 01:16:37,166
I don't wanna stay.
Not without you.

1308
01:16:37,309 --> 01:16:39,675
I can't. I can't.

1309
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:43,743
Who knows you, Raymond?

1310
01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:46,112
Who takes care of you?

1311
01:16:47,486 --> 01:16:48,145
Martha.

1312
01:16:48,287 --> 01:16:50,517
Who... wants you like you are?

1313
01:16:50,656 --> 01:16:52,920
Who's never...
ever gonna leave... you?

1314
01:16:53,091 --> 01:16:56,527
Who do you love, Raymond?
Tell me. Who- who is... it?

1315
01:16:56,662 --> 01:16:58,061
Martha!

1316
01:16:58,196 --> 01:16:59,458
Then show me.

1317
01:17:00,098 --> 01:17:00,530
Show...

1318
01:17:00,666 --> 01:17:03,965
Martha that you love her.
Prove it.

1319
01:17:04,503 --> 01:17:06,130
Prove it... baby.

1320
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,468
Oh no, not- not like that.

1321
01:17:09,608 --> 01:17:13,237
If you- if you don't want to hug me...
don't even try it.

1322
01:17:13,378 --> 01:17:14,606
I don't want you
to prove it like that.

1323
01:17:14,746 --> 01:17:16,043
Shoot her.

1324
01:17:18,083 --> 01:17:21,246
Do you love... me?
Do you love me?

1325
01:17:21,653 --> 01:17:23,177
Say you love me!

1326
01:17:23,322 --> 01:17:24,186
Yes!

1327
01:17:24,323 --> 01:17:25,790
Then... do it.

1328
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:35,666
Do it...
because you love me.

1329
01:17:47,546 --> 01:17:49,514
Mommy!

1330
01:18:29,821 --> 01:18:31,880
Speed limit's thirty miles
an hour back here.

1331
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:34,353
What's your hurry?

1332
01:18:34,826 --> 01:18:35,986
I don't know.

1333
01:18:36,895 --> 01:18:41,525
Driver's license, please.
What's the lime for?

1334
01:18:42,667 --> 01:18:43,929
Horse died.

1335
01:18:44,202 --> 01:18:45,226
Hm.

1336
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:00,508
Dispatch Code Three.

1337
01:19:01,186 --> 01:19:02,949
Get back in your vehicle, sir.

1338
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:05,551
I said get...
back in your truck.

1339
01:19:38,123 --> 01:19:40,751
You have any idea how many
interstate APB's go out in a week?

1340
01:19:42,961 --> 01:19:44,326
I'm leaving.

1341
01:19:45,964 --> 01:19:48,956
All right.
Well, see you later.

1342
01:19:49,534 --> 01:19:50,660
No.

1343
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:57,067
I'm going to Rochester
to live with my sister.

1344
01:19:58,477 --> 01:20:00,274
Found a job
and everything, so.

1345
01:20:04,483 --> 01:20:05,973
What the
hell you gonna do that for?

1346
01:20:06,618 --> 01:20:08,313
I got nothing keeping me here.

1347
01:20:09,554 --> 01:20:10,578
Buster.

1348
01:20:11,723 --> 01:20:13,987
They're in Michigan.
They killed a cop.

1349
01:20:14,125 --> 01:20:14,853
Did they... get 'em?

1350
01:20:14,993 --> 01:20:16,620
Not yet.
I got us a flight out of Idyllwild.

1351
01:20:16,761 --> 01:20:18,456
We gotta go... right now.
Come on.

1352
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:23,258
I don't want you to go.

1353
01:20:23,435 --> 01:20:25,062
So stop me.

1354
01:20:46,124 --> 01:20:48,058
I'll be back in a couple days.
Don't go.

1355
01:20:49,127 --> 01:20:50,526
Take care of Eddie.

1356
01:21:28,366 --> 01:21:34,271
Look at that, a brand new tricycle.
How 'bout that, huh?

1357
01:21:36,841 --> 01:21:39,173
Did you wanna look at it?
It's in that box.

1358
01:21:39,878 --> 01:21:41,869
It's beautiful.
Just like you wanted.

1359
01:21:54,225 --> 01:21:56,785
Fellas.
Hunt, Kent County...

1360
01:21:56,895 --> 01:21:58,385
Robinson, Nassau County.

1361
01:21:58,530 --> 01:21:59,724
Tooley, detective squad.

1362
01:21:59,864 --> 01:22:00,922
Charlie.

1363
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:03,759
You got uh, information on
a case we're investigating.

1364
01:22:03,902 --> 01:22:05,870
Well it's actually our case
we're investigating.

1365
01:22:06,137 --> 01:22:07,968
This is... my sandbox,
Detective.

1366
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:10,835
Well it's kind of like
a fly shitting on pepper,

1367
01:22:10,976 --> 01:22:12,170
if you catch my drift.

1368
01:22:12,410 --> 01:22:14,970
Maybe you wouldn't mind
explaining something to me.

1369
01:22:15,146 --> 01:22:17,376
- What's that?
- Why didn't you just phone it in?

1370
01:22:18,383 --> 01:22:20,715
When was the last time you lost
an officer in the line?

1371
01:22:20,919 --> 01:22:22,284
This is the first.

1372
01:22:22,954 --> 01:22:24,251
So you don't practice
capital punishment

1373
01:22:24,389 --> 01:22:27,324
here in the uh,
Wolverine State, do ya?

1374
01:22:27,959 --> 01:22:30,052
Look, you help us catch 'em...
we'll invite you up to

1375
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:32,060
New York for an honest trial

1376
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:34,563
and a first class
Westinghouse fish fry.

1377
01:22:34,733 --> 01:22:36,166
You got no body.

1378
01:22:36,334 --> 01:22:38,859
No body, no murder.
No murder, no extradition.

1379
01:22:39,170 --> 01:22:40,330
You don't know where they are.

1380
01:22:40,705 --> 01:22:43,435
So, we make a deal
or we let them slip

1381
01:22:43,575 --> 01:22:45,304
into a more
sympathetic commonwealth.

1382
01:22:46,845 --> 01:22:48,745
Well how do we know
you've even got something?

1383
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:52,444
What's that...
supposed to be?

1384
01:22:52,784 --> 01:22:55,218
A P.O. Box, Grand Rapids.

1385
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,114
We... got a deal?

1386
01:22:58,757 --> 01:22:59,985
Do we have a... deal?

1387
01:23:01,993 --> 01:23:03,858
Yeah, yeah, come on, come on.

1388
01:23:10,301 --> 01:23:11,768
Hey. Hey.

1389
01:23:11,936 --> 01:23:15,565
Stop pouting, you spoiled brat.
Stop pouting.

1390
01:23:15,807 --> 01:23:17,365
How you doing, ol' timer?

1391
01:23:17,742 --> 01:23:18,936
That your dog?

1392
01:23:19,444 --> 01:23:20,502
Yes sir.

1393
01:23:20,645 --> 01:23:23,045
God... damn,
he's an ugly son of a bitch.

1394
01:23:23,181 --> 01:23:24,478
How much you want for him?

1395
01:23:24,983 --> 01:23:26,348
He ain't for sale.

1396
01:23:27,152 --> 01:23:29,017
Everything's for sale.

1397
01:23:30,321 --> 01:23:31,686
A thousand dollars.

1398
01:23:31,823 --> 01:23:32,346
What?

1399
01:23:32,490 --> 01:23:34,014
Take it or leave it.

1400
01:23:35,193 --> 01:23:37,889
A thousand... dollars.

1401
01:23:38,730 --> 01:23:39,719
I'll take it.

1402
01:23:48,406 --> 01:23:49,873
Here's one from our boy.

1403
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:52,436
My dearest Delphine,
I can't wait to see you.

1404
01:23:53,478 --> 01:23:54,604
There's no date.

1405
01:23:54,879 --> 01:23:56,870
There's only one reason
she wouldn't check her mail.

1406
01:23:59,551 --> 01:24:00,677
He's already here.

1407
01:24:03,354 --> 01:24:06,755
Two-oh-four Adeline Place.
Byron Center.

1408
01:24:23,541 --> 01:24:25,133
Honey, would you like some milk?

1409
01:24:26,444 --> 01:24:27,468
Hm?

1410
01:24:30,582 --> 01:24:34,211
Maybe later, huh? Hm?

1411
01:24:36,087 --> 01:24:39,215
What's the matter?
You don't like your dog?

1412
01:24:39,758 --> 01:24:41,453
He's not my dog.

1413
01:24:43,161 --> 01:24:44,458
Listen.

1414
01:24:45,697 --> 01:24:48,097
You know you're all alone now.

1415
01:24:51,703 --> 01:24:54,103
And I know how that feels.

1416
01:24:55,406 --> 01:24:58,102
It burns on your skin.

1417
01:24:58,243 --> 01:24:59,369
Hm?

1418
01:25:01,379 --> 01:25:07,181
Makes you feel a really bad
pain right on your stomach.

1419
01:25:07,452 --> 01:25:10,444
You can't breathe well.

1420
01:25:10,989 --> 01:25:14,356
You feel
like you're in a dark room

1421
01:25:14,893 --> 01:25:19,489
and that the walls are
coming down on you,

1422
01:25:19,631 --> 01:25:25,934
and that no one
can come and save you.

1423
01:25:27,338 --> 01:25:32,241
I know how you feel, honey.
Do you feel... lonely?

1424
01:25:33,178 --> 01:25:36,477
Hm? Do you feel Ionely?

1425
01:25:37,749 --> 01:25:39,910
You don't have to feel Ionely.

1426
01:25:40,118 --> 01:25:43,451
I'm gonna take
such good care of you, baby.

1427
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:48,454
I'm gonna be such
a good mommy.

1428
01:25:50,261 --> 01:25:53,253
I'm gonna love you so much.

1429
01:25:57,535 --> 01:26:01,198
But you must love me back.
Understand?

1430
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:05,734
You must love me back.

1431
01:26:05,877 --> 01:26:07,276
I hate you!

1432
01:26:07,745 --> 01:26:08,507
No you don't.

1433
01:26:08,646 --> 01:26:09,510
I hate you!

1434
01:26:09,647 --> 01:26:10,443
No.

1435
01:28:08,766 --> 01:28:10,028
Ray!

1436
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:15,036
Don't fire! I got him!

1437
01:28:23,948 --> 01:28:26,041
Get him! Get him!
Son of a bitch!

1438
01:28:26,217 --> 01:28:27,115
No!

1439
01:28:27,285 --> 01:28:29,014
No!

1440
01:28:41,399 --> 01:28:42,627
So where's Mrs. Downing?

1441
01:28:42,767 --> 01:28:43,734
I don't know.

1442
01:28:43,868 --> 01:28:45,460
Where is the little girl?

1443
01:28:48,006 --> 01:28:49,234
I don't know.

1444
01:28:53,878 --> 01:28:55,277
Only four... in the clip.

1445
01:28:56,914 --> 01:28:58,245
Whose gun is this?

1446
01:29:07,992 --> 01:29:10,688
You... got five seconds to tell me
where that fucking little girl is.

1447
01:29:13,598 --> 01:29:14,792
Sweetheart.

1448
01:31:00,404 --> 01:31:03,931
Oh god. Oh god.

1449
01:31:31,536 --> 01:31:34,505
Once we found Delphine Downing...
toes-up in the shed,

1450
01:31:34,872 --> 01:31:36,965
it was no trouble
to find Janette Long.

1451
01:31:37,975 --> 01:31:41,741
She'd been there all along, rotting...
away under the coal chute.

1452
01:31:44,482 --> 01:31:46,746
But the Kent County prosecutor
wasrt giving up the biggest...

1453
01:31:46,884 --> 01:31:49,216
pinch since Bugs Moran
without a confession.

1454
01:31:50,254 --> 01:31:51,585
So we sweated 'em.

1455
01:31:53,424 --> 01:31:55,517
The truth is, though,
animals like that,

1456
01:31:55,660 --> 01:31:59,562
they can't wait to tell you
their story, while it was ripe.

1457
01:32:04,569 --> 01:32:05,934
Want a donut?

1458
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:10,503
You know what they say
about cops and donuts?

1459
01:32:10,908 --> 01:32:11,897
No, what?

1460
01:32:13,311 --> 01:32:15,506
Neither one is
any good without a hole in them.

1461
01:32:17,215 --> 01:32:18,705
They say that
about women, too.

1462
01:32:28,693 --> 01:32:30,183
It's good to see you have a sense
of humor considering

1463
01:32:30,328 --> 01:32:31,955
what you got ahead of you.

1464
01:32:32,430 --> 01:32:36,332
Room and board for
the next fifty, sixty years?

1465
01:32:37,468 --> 01:32:38,992
Be worse
if you had it your way.

1466
01:32:40,304 --> 01:32:41,396
That's true.

1467
01:32:41,505 --> 01:32:43,166
I know who you are.

1468
01:32:44,275 --> 01:32:45,435
You do?

1469
01:32:51,482 --> 01:32:52,676
That's good.

1470
01:32:56,387 --> 01:32:57,411
Tell you what.

1471
01:32:57,822 --> 01:32:59,449
Let's don't...
bullshit each other, huh?

1472
01:32:59,624 --> 01:33:00,648
Fine.

1473
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:03,024
I'm not gonna ask you much.

1474
01:33:03,227 --> 01:33:05,422
I'm not gonna ask you about
the pretty girl in the bathtub.

1475
01:33:05,630 --> 01:33:07,393
I'm not gonna
ask you about the uh,

1476
01:33:07,531 --> 01:33:10,329
three dozen women that you
fleeced across the country.

1477
01:33:10,468 --> 01:33:14,165
I'm not even gonna ask you
to tell me where Janette Long's body is.

1478
01:33:14,772 --> 01:33:16,137
But I am gonna ask you what...

1479
01:33:16,274 --> 01:33:20,938
happened, because there's a young lady
and three kids that need to know,

1480
01:33:21,078 --> 01:33:24,047
'cause they wanna understand
so they can move on with their lives.

1481
01:33:24,248 --> 01:33:27,149
You'd just love it
to be that simple, wouldn't you?

1482
01:33:27,718 --> 01:33:31,916
Put it in a little box,
explain what you can't.

1483
01:33:32,056 --> 01:33:33,887
Like you did
with that little girl, huh?

1484
01:33:34,025 --> 01:33:37,620
What? That's what you're
all about too, isn't it?

1485
01:33:38,362 --> 01:33:42,662
Making things, people,
just go away?

1486
01:33:44,935 --> 01:33:49,463
You can't just throw things away.
What you did to people.

1487
01:33:50,541 --> 01:33:55,706
It's always there, out there,
waiting for you in the dark.

1488
01:33:55,846 --> 01:33:57,074
Sure enough.

1489
01:33:58,015 --> 01:34:03,078
The thing is, though,
you'd just as soon see me burn...

1490
01:34:03,688 --> 01:34:05,246
so you can go home...

1491
01:34:05,489 --> 01:34:07,719
to your little house,
your little wife,

1492
01:34:07,858 --> 01:34:11,316
your little life,
and pound your chest like a monkey.

1493
01:34:11,462 --> 01:34:12,759
Huh?

1494
01:34:15,166 --> 01:34:19,967
I take some amusement in denying you
and your donuts that pleasure.

1495
01:34:22,406 --> 01:34:23,304
Ms. Beck.

1496
01:34:23,441 --> 01:34:25,739
- You can call me Martha, honey.
- Martha.

1497
01:34:27,078 --> 01:34:32,516
My life is a never-ending
sewer of maggots like you.

1498
01:34:34,618 --> 01:34:36,984
You're gonna grow old
and die in a concrete box

1499
01:34:37,121 --> 01:34:39,681
with bars at one end
and a shitter at the other.

1500
01:34:39,990 --> 01:34:42,220
In a couple of years
I won't even remember your name.

1501
01:34:42,393 --> 01:34:46,591
Just gonna be a case
file stamped, Closed.

1502
01:34:48,432 --> 01:34:51,765
But you got an opportunity...
to help somebody.

1503
01:34:52,570 --> 01:34:55,334
It's not much, really...
considering what you did.

1504
01:34:56,374 --> 01:34:59,275
It would be the one...
decent thing that you do

1505
01:34:59,410 --> 01:35:02,140
in what's left of your sad
and pathetic life.

1506
01:35:11,889 --> 01:35:16,917
We did it with a hammer.
Ray, he strangled her.

1507
01:35:17,862 --> 01:35:19,261
He didn't do any more than I did.

1508
01:35:19,397 --> 01:35:20,887
I'm not trying
to pass that off on him.

1509
01:35:21,031 --> 01:35:22,328
We both did it.

1510
01:35:25,002 --> 01:35:27,903
It's just that one
bitch wouldn't die.

1511
01:35:30,007 --> 01:35:31,235
That's all.

1512
01:35:33,043 --> 01:35:34,203
That's all.

1513
01:35:38,716 --> 01:35:40,206
We hauled 'em back to New York.

1514
01:35:40,718 --> 01:35:43,346
The trial lasted forty-four days.

1515
01:35:44,021 --> 01:35:46,888
They were charged with three
murders and tied to twenty more.

1516
01:35:47,625 --> 01:35:50,253
But it only took
Janette Long to get 'em the juice.

1517
01:36:11,849 --> 01:36:13,111
Looks nice.

1518
01:36:16,053 --> 01:36:19,545
You know, I built it for her.
Well, for both of you.

1519
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:21,657
She would've liked that.

1520
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:24,318
I wished I had told her.

1521
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:26,496
You told me.

1522
01:36:27,665 --> 01:36:29,599
You know, I don't know
why she left us, Eddie.

1523
01:36:30,601 --> 01:36:37,029
I mean I, I could understand
why she'd leave me but, you, no.

1524
01:36:38,876 --> 01:36:40,275
It wasrt your fault.

1525
01:36:41,145 --> 01:36:42,669
It wasrt your fault, either.

1526
01:36:51,055 --> 01:36:52,249
You know where I'm going?

1527
01:36:52,389 --> 01:36:53,583
Yeah.

1528
01:36:54,024 --> 01:36:55,651
You know how to rig...
the trailer hitch?

1529
01:36:56,827 --> 01:36:57,919
Yeah.

1530
01:36:58,028 --> 01:36:59,791
Why don't ya pick me up afterwards.

1531
01:37:09,673 --> 01:37:11,038
Careful with the fender.

1532
01:38:09,533 --> 01:38:11,330
Okay. Okay.

1533
01:38:11,468 --> 01:38:12,833
You wanna know why?

1534
01:38:13,938 --> 01:38:15,838
You wanna know why we did it?

1535
01:38:16,006 --> 01:38:19,533
Okay Martha, why?
Why'd you do it?

1536
01:38:20,978 --> 01:38:26,712
Because Raymond is mine.
He belongs to me.

1537
01:38:33,591 --> 01:38:35,388
God, he's a lover.

1538
01:38:36,894 --> 01:38:38,555
So... romantic.

1539
01:38:39,964 --> 01:38:42,125
I'm the only one for him.

1540
01:38:43,067 --> 01:38:44,898
Nothing comes between us.

1541
01:38:47,071 --> 01:38:48,163
No one.

1542
01:38:48,806 --> 01:38:50,330
Raymond Martinez Fernandez,

1543
01:38:50,474 --> 01:38:52,305
you've been duly convicted
and sentenced to death to...

1544
01:38:52,443 --> 01:38:53,842
be carried out forthwith.

1545
01:38:54,612 --> 01:38:56,136
Do you have anything...
to say?

1546
01:39:01,752 --> 01:39:03,185
Oh god.

1547
01:39:04,421 --> 01:39:05,581
Oh my god.

1548
01:39:06,056 --> 01:39:10,823
He kills... for me.
That's how much he loves me.

1549
01:39:14,064 --> 01:39:16,532
What else would anybody kill...
or die for?

1550
01:39:19,336 --> 01:39:19,893
Has anybody...

1551
01:39:20,037 --> 01:39:22,665
ever loved you that much,
Detective?

1552
01:39:23,741 --> 01:39:26,073
To kill or die for you?

1553
01:40:04,181 --> 01:40:09,209
I can smell him.
So sweet.

1554
01:40:10,788 --> 01:40:12,085
Martha Jule Beck,

1555
01:40:12,289 --> 01:40:13,847
you've been duly
convicted and sentenced...

1556
01:40:13,991 --> 01:40:15,652
to death to be
carried out forthwith.

1557
01:40:15,793 --> 01:40:17,226
Do you have anything to say?

1558
01:40:25,936 --> 01:40:27,335
So long.

1559
01:40:53,497 --> 01:40:54,987
You don't look so good.

1560
01:40:58,168 --> 01:40:59,465
I'm all right.

1561
01:40:59,770 --> 01:41:00,998
You sure?

1562
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:04,368
An eye for an eye... right?

1563
01:41:05,442 --> 01:41:06,306
Yeah.

1564
01:41:06,443 --> 01:41:07,603
Yeah.

1565
01:41:08,545 --> 01:41:10,809
They don't have enough
eyes and teeth

1566
01:41:10,948 --> 01:41:13,576
between 'em to pay for
what they did, though.

1567
01:41:16,286 --> 01:41:19,483
Some- some god damn
fish fry, huh?

1568
01:41:22,559 --> 01:41:24,959
Like MacSwain said,
this is a good one.

1569
01:41:27,030 --> 01:41:30,830
I don't know, Charlie.
It don't feel that good to me.

1570
01:41:33,704 --> 01:41:35,296
Yeah, well
I know why they're in there.

1571
01:41:35,639 --> 01:41:38,733
I know why.
We just did our job.

1572
01:41:40,110 --> 01:41:41,407
We did.

1573
01:41:55,125 --> 01:41:57,616
For a long time I didn't understand
what he did that day.

1574
01:41:58,362 --> 01:42:00,830
I figured he tossed a gold
shield career into the shitter.

1575
01:42:05,435 --> 01:42:07,926
But it started to hit me
what the job had become for Buster.

1576
01:42:10,107 --> 01:42:11,233
And for me, too.

1577
01:42:15,012 --> 01:42:16,138
Buster left his...
regrets and what didn't work

1578
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:19,147
no more in the
Sing Sing Death House.

1579
01:42:19,650 --> 01:42:24,280
He pushed up river for better days.
And he never looked back.
