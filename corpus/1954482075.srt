00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PREVIEW

2
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,500
Seven children, attending a children's camp,

3
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,560
were guided by mysterious
devices to File Island,

4
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,330
a place where Digital Monsters -
Digimon - lived.

5
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,200
But soon after their arrival, they were
attacked by a ferocious Digimon, Kuwagamon.

6
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,285
Just as they were
driven into a corner, the

7
00:01:55,286 --> 00:01:57,800
tiny Digimon that were
following them evolved.

8
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:02,750
But, even though they thought
they had defeated Kuwagamon,

9
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,950
it came back, putting the children
in more grave danger...

10
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,860
Explosive Evolution! Greymon

11
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,430
Sora!

12
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:24,900
Koushiro!

13
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,370
Takeru!

14
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,780
Marching Fishes!

15
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,990
W-We're saved...

16
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,800
Hey, over there!

17
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,700
Faster!

18
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,130
Now we're finally out of danger.

19
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,580
What was the deal with those fishes?

20
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,170
Those were my Marching Fishes.

21
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,650
I'm able to control fish at will.

22
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:50,050
I see, so it was all thanks to you!
Thank you, Pukamon... I mean...

23
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,250
That is...

24
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,760
It's Gomamon.

25
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,020
Gomamon?

26
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,090
What happened to you, Tokomon?

27
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,990
I'm Patamon now.

28
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,970
We've evolved.

29
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,970
"Evolved?" What's that mean?

30
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,155
Normally, it's when
organisms in a species

31
00:04:08,156 --> 00:04:10,770
change to adapt better
to their environment...

32
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,100
That's right! From that evolution,

33
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,940
I changed from Motimon into Tentomon.

34
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,420
I evolved from Pyocomon to Piyomon.

35
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,880
I evolved from Tsunomon to Gabumon.

36
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,350
I evolved from Tanemon to Palmon.

37
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,820
And I evolved from Koromon to Agumon.

38
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,500
In any case, you seem stronger than before.

39
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,810
Are you still a Digital Monster,
even after you've evolved?

40
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,930
Yup! I'm so glad to have met you, Taichi!

41
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:41,870
Huh? Why?

42
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,340
I haven't been able to evolve on my own.

43
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,460
I'm sure I was able to now
because I met you.

44
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,670
Then, is it the same for you, Piyomon?

45
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,210
Yes.

46
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,300
Could it be the same for everyone?

47
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,680
Yes it is!

48
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,910
It's all thanks to you, Mimi!

49
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,660
But I don't even know what I did...

50
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,230
Are you able to turn back?

51
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,130
Maybe not.

52
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,830
This still doesn't make much sense to me.

53
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,360
It doesn't make much sense to us either.

54
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,070
More importantly, what are we
going to do now?

55
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,480
Let's go back to where we came from!

56
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,900
We should wait for
the adults to come find us.

57
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,360
That's easier said than done...

58
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,390
We've been swept pretty far away...

59
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,910
It doesn't look easy going
back up that cliff either.

60
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,050
Then what should we do?

61
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,520
How about we look for a road somewhere...

62
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,250
More to the point, where are we?

63
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,060
It doesn't look like the camp site,
no matter where I look.

64
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,010
He's right. The vegetation looks
like they're from the subtropics.

65
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:43,860
It sure does!

66
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,010
Eh, you know what I'm talking about?

67
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:45,660
No.

68
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,000
There should be a road that
leads back up there.

69
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:56,320
Perhaps so. If we go back, we might be
able to find clues on why we're here.

70
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:00,130
But aren't there more monsters
like the one from before?

71
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,040
Yes, there are.

72
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,420
See?

73
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,220
I don't want to put anyone in danger...

74
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,560
Are there any other humans here?

75
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,700
Humans? Like you?

76
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,390
Yeah.

77
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,360
I've never seen any.
There's nothing but Digimon here.

78
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:19,330
Only Digimon? But you all
sure look different.

79
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:24,310
You said that... this is File Island, right?

80
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,810
Is it really an island?

81
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,590
I've never heard of it.

82
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,280
This place probably isn't in Japan...

83
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,930
Anyway, let's go.

84
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,650
There's no point standing around here.

85
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,820
Hey, where do you think you're going?

86
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,790
I saw the ocean awhile ago!

87
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,250
The ocean?

88
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,650
Yeah.

89
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:42,960
So let's go see it!

90
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,850
Should we go?

91
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:46,560
Yeah.

92
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,420
In times like these, it's best to stay put
and wait for the adults to save us.

93
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,920
That's also the reason why
we should go back to...

94
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,470
Jyou!

95
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,350
Hurry up!

96
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,440
Hey!

97
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,260
I've never seen trees like these...

98
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,380
I thought they were subtropical at first,
but it appears I was wrong.

99
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,850
Maybe this really isn't Japan...
they look really strange.

100
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,730
These Digital Monsters should have been
a big tip-off that this place is strange.

101
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,670
Digital Monster.. like, electronic monsters?

102
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,570
You can refer to us as Digimon.

103
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,930
You don't appear as electronical
as your name suggests.

104
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,960
What's that, electricity? How's this?

105
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,810
Hey, stop that!

106
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,020
Patamon, you were flying before, right?

107
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,710
Yeah, I can fly now. Look!

108
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:33,270
Cool!

109
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,310
But I think it's faster if you walked.

110
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,320
I'm much faster! Look!

111
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,020
There's no difference.

112
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:45,190
Palmon, you look kind of like a plant.

113
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,530
I am. I can even perform photosynthesis.

114
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,920
That's neat! Do it, do it!

115
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,830
Mimi, do you know what photosynthesis is?

116
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,800
Um, not really. What is it?

117
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,270
Well, I don't really know either...

118
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,680
You said there was nothing but
Digimon here, right?

119
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,810
Yeah.

120
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,650
So that means Kuwagamon was a Digimon?

121
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,240
Yeah.

122
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,270
If there was a big one like him around,
there might be others...

123
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,210
We've already said there
are only Digimon here.

124
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,180
I smell the ocean!

125
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,650
And I see it! It's the ocean!

126
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,070
Why is there a phone ringing
in a place like this?

127
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,250
What's wrong, Taichi?

128
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,450
It stopped.

129
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,420
I can't believe there
are phone booths here...

130
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,080
It's irrational!

131
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,750
But they do look like the phone
booths we normally see...

132
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,850
They're the same as the one
next to my house.

133
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,430
Which means...

134
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,400
We must still be in Japan!

135
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,720
Japan?

136
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,000
Jyou, what's that?

137
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,440
...Or maybe not.

138
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,740
Koushiro, lend me 10 cents.

139
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,810
What are you going to do?

140
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,410
Isn't it obvious? I'm calling home.

141
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,180
Oh, then you can use my phone card for that.

142
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,630
Ah, I'm calling Mom!

143
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,620
Me too!

144
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,790
Me too.

145
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,630
Hey, Takeru!

146
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,020
I'll try too.

147
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,400
Even Sora-kun is joining in...

148
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,740
Hello? It's me.

149
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,940
The time is now 35:82:90 AM.

150
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,640
Beep. Beep. Beep. BEEP!

151
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,640
Wha-... What the heck?

152
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:52,840
Tomorrow's weather will be sunny,
with occasional ice cream.

153
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,840
Huh? Did I dial the wrong number?

154
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:58,320
The number you dialed is no longer
in service. Calling again is pointless!

155
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,210
This is weird, Onii-chan.

156
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,320
I'll try calling my own house.

157
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,420
What's wrong with this phone?

158
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,550
How are things over here?

159
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,940
Doesn't look like it worked.

160
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,180
Currently, this phone is outside
of all service areas.

161
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,650
Well?

162
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,750
Nothing.

163
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,580
Thought so.

164
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,040
What is with these phones?

165
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,370
How about this?

166
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,130
The time is now 90:99:100 AM.

167
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:47,500
Beep. Beep. Beep. BEEP!

168
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,500
Next!

169
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,570
He's pretty persistent.

170
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,230
That's Jyou for ya.

171
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:58,720
No matter where we call, the only thing
we get is random information.

172
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,690
Let's give up and get a move on.

173
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,420
Wait a second.

174
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:06,890
Even if we can't call, there might be
someone who'll call us. Like the one earlier

175
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,360
It's a waste of time staying here.

176
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,220
It won't hurt to keep an eye out here.

177
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,330
Besides, everyone's tired!

178
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,340
We're all kind of hungry as well.

179
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,650
I guess.

180
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,270
We haven't had lunch yet.

181
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,450
All right, let's take a break!

182
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:32,430
Does anyone have anything to eat?
All I have is this...

183
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:32,810
Huh?

184
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,580
This is the thing that came
falling from the sky...

185
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,690
Oh yeah.

186
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,990
I've got one too.

187
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,960
Mine's on my bag.

188
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,580
I have one too.

189
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,760
Looks like everyone is holding one.

190
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,740
I wonder what these things are...

191
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,170
Anyway, we were talking about food,
weren't we?

192
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:57,570
All I have is a travel-size first-aid kit.

193
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:01,340
It has adhesive tape, disinfectant,
and some thread and needles.

194
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,570
I have this laptop, digital camera,
and a cell phone...

195
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,770
But since I've come here, none of them work.

196
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,200
I thought I still had some battery left...

197
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,680
You sure brought a lot of junk
to summer camp.

198
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,560
What about you, Taichi-san?

199
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,870
Oh, me?

200
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,530
Just this. A mini-telescope.

201
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,030
I didn't bring any food either.

202
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,500
I did.

203
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,150
See?

204
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,970
Candy! It looks so tasty!

205
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,800
But wait, you're not from our
school, are you?

206
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,600
Nope. Since it's summer vacation,
I came to visit my onii-chan.

207
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,730
Right, Onii-chan?

208
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,010
Y-Yeah...

209
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,300
He calls Yamato "Onii-chan."

210
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,700
Maybe they're cousins...

211
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,490
Mimi-chan, what did you bring?
Your bag looks pretty big.

212
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,960
Oh this? Well...

213
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,180
I have this solid fuel, a Swiss army knife,

214
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,860
A compass, a flashlight, and then...

215
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,830
You're pretty prepared for survival...

216
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:03,900
It's been a long time since I've gone to
camp, so I borrowed my dad's gear.

217
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,300
Secretly.

218
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,310
You don't normally bring this stuff though.

219
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,280
But they may turn out
to be useful to us now.

220
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,250
That's true... we don't know what
to expect from now on...

221
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,710
Yeah... you're right.

222
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,060
Anyway... looks like Jyou's still
making phone calls,

223
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,750
but there's no way he
could have brought food or...

224
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,160
What the?

225
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,920
He has the emergency food supply!

226
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:27,760
He does!

227
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,500
Hey, Jyou! You're carrying
the emergency rations!

228
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,340
Why do I have to carry that?!

229
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,790
But that bag...

230
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,890
Bag?

231
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:40,170
Oh yeah, I've been trying to hand
this over to Mimi-kun!

232
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,640
He's talking about you.

233
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,400
Me?

234
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,870
Mimi-kun, it was your turn to take
charge of the emergency rations.

235
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,490
You need to keep a better eye on it!

236
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,670
But it's so heavy!

237
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,690
Don't be so selfish!

238
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,050
Now, now!

239
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,720
It's great just knowing that
we have something to eat.

240
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,140
Now let's have some lunch!

241
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,030
Right!

242
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,150
Each group is given three
days worth of food.

243
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,900
Since our group had six people, 6x3x3 is...

244
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,250
54 meals.

245
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,290
Right!

246
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,310
So if we divide that up
evenly between 7 people...

247
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,500
Two and a half days.

248
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,680
R-Right...

249
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,080
But since we're sharing with the Digimon,
it'll be half that.

250
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,620
The food won't last for more than a day.

251
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,170
Oh yeah...

252
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:31,020
We're fine. We'll find food for ourselves.

253
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,600
You don't need to count us in.

254
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,970
Is that really okay?

255
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,000
Yeah, it is. It's what
we've always been doing.

256
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,510
That really helps us!

257
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,720
Okay then, this food will
be for the humans...

258
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,930
How is it? Taste good, Agumon?

259
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:47,740
Yeah!

260
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,880
<i>aid  it's only for the humans!</i>

261
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,910
Oh relax. Don't be stingy!

262
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,770
No!

263
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,790
What's wrong, Piyomon?

264
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,760
Something's coming.

265
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,550
Wh-What is it?

266
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:26,660
It's Shellmon!

267
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,430
Shellmon?

268
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,480
This area must be his territory!

269
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,460
Shell!

270
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:47,470
Shellmon. He is an aggressive
Adult Level Digimon.

271
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,940
Everyone, this way!

272
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,610
Jyou!!

273
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,130
Let's go, guys!

274
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,450
I'm counting on you, Agumon!

275
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,790
Baby Flame!

276
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,230
Petit Fiyaaa... huh?

277
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,730
Magical Fi-...

278
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:16,200
Huh?

279
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,540
Petit Thunder...

280
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,170
Ugh...

281
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,630
What's wrong?

282
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,100
Their attacks aren't working!

283
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,220
Agumon!

284
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,020
Damn it!

285
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,240
Air Sho...

286
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,470
Poison Ivy!

287
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,240
Huh...?

288
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,020
Baby Flame!

289
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,960
Looking good, Agumon!

290
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,250
How come only Agumon can fight?

291
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,930
I'm sorry... I'm so... hungry...

292
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,450
Gabumon...

293
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,830
I have no strength...

294
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,530
I get it! It's because Agumon ate earlier!

295
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,190
I see...

296
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,000
So does that mean the other Digimon
have no power to fight?

297
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,980
Agumon, we'll have to make do on our own!

298
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,950
Gotcha, Taichi!

299
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,920
Hey! Over here, Shellmon!

300
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,380
Taichi!

301
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,550
Baby Flame!

302
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,620
Take this!

303
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,330
You piece of...

304
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,230
Damn it!

305
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,230
Taichi!

306
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,380
Damn it!

307
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,800
At this rate, everyone will...

308
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,400
Isn't there anything we can do?!

309
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,310
Taichi!

310
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,380
Agumon!

311
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,750
Taichi!!

312
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,670
Wh-What's that?

313
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,480
Agumon, evolve!

314
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,190
Greymon!

315
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,450
He evolved again...

316
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,960
into Greymon?

317
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,880
You can do it, Greymon!

318
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:03,030
Mega Flame!

319
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,360
Agumon!

320
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,890
You changed back...

321
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,620
Are you okay, Agumon?

322
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,160
Taichi...

323
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,860
I'm hungry...

324
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,720
Hello? Hello?!

325
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,180
There's no reason for us to stay here now.

326
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,060
Yeah...

327
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:48,240
Eat as much as you want!

328
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,960
We haven't completely beaten Shellmon.

329
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,980
We should leave before he comes back
to assault us again.

330
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,110
That's true.

331
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,140
Then let's go back to that forest!

332
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,150
The forest that we turned up in.

333
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,250
Let's wait for help there!

334
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:08,530
Like I said before, we fell off a cliff
and went downstream.

335
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,130
We can't get back so easily.

336
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,590
No more Kuwagamon!

337
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:16,840
Since there were phones here,
there must be people who've put them there.

338
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,630
We should go look for them.

339
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,550
That's a good idea...

340
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,570
I agree with that plan.

341
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,310
All right! Let's do it!

342
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:29,080
I'll go wherever you go, Taichi!

343
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,880
Thanks, Agumon!

344
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,530
Then it's decided.

345
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,350
Yeah.

346
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,330
Make sure you don't leave
your stuff behind, everyone!

347
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,610
All right! Let's go!

348
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:46,240
And so, the seven children
and Digimon set off...

349
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,660
into an unknown world of adventure.

350
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,250
"I must protect my little brother
at all costs."

351
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:47,190
As these thoughts weigh over Yamato's head,
a vicious lake Digimon attacks him!

352
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:51,230
To save Takeru, Yamato tries
to sacrifices himself,

353
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,990
but then a huge wolf engulfed
in blue flames rushes to his rescue!

354
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:00,610
Next Episode of Digimon Adventure:
The Blue Wolf! Garurumon

355
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,720
Now the adventure evolves.

356
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:20,700
Ryuu-Rogue Presents

357
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,700
Translation: onkei-kun
Timing: mirrim

358
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:14,960
Explosive Evolution! Greymon

359
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,075
Note: "Onii-chan," which means
"older brother," can also be used

360
00:12:41,076 --> 00:12:42,388
towards an older boy cousin.
Since Yamato and Takeru have

361
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:43,700
different last names, the kids
