With the wind of day.

The man and his wife
hid themselves from hashem

Among the trees
of the garden.

Hashem called to the man,

"where are you?"

But the question
is for adam to answer.

200

All men must answer this.

Judaism
is about community.

It's about looking outward
to others,

01:27:01,482 --> 01:27:07,620
¶ when the days were the dark
and the nights so long ¶

1729
01:27:07,621 --> 01:27:10,156
¶ I know in the light ¶

1730
01:27:10,157 --> 01:27:13,993
¶ I'm never alone ¶

1731
01:27:13,994 --> 01:27:17,663
¶ and I lay on my back
and count the stars ¶

1732
01:27:17,664 --> 01:27:20,666
¶ and look for a light
that will guide me on ¶

1733
01:27:20,667 --> 01:27:27,173
¶ I know it's darkest
before the dawn ¶

1734
01:27:27,174 --> 01:27:31,010
¶ and I lay where I may
to count the stars ¶

1735
01:27:31,011 --> 01:27:34,180
¶ knowing that I,
I'm never alone ¶

1736
01:27:34,181 --> 01:27:39,018
¶ and it's darkest
before the dawn ¶

1737
01:27:41,488 --> 01:27:44,990
¶ and even the stars so bright ¶

1738
01:27:44,991 --> 01:27:48,827
¶ may not have enough light ¶

1739
01:27:48,828 --> 01:27:54,833
¶ and if I should lose my way ¶

1740
01:27:54,834 --> 01:27:58,804
¶ and, oh,
when the morning comes ¶

1741
01:27:58,805 --> 01:28:01,340
¶ and the sun shines on ¶

1742
01:28:01,341 --> 01:28:03,676
¶ it's gonna shine on ¶

1743
01:28:03,677 --> 01:28:05,344
¶ shine on ¶

1744
01:28:05,345 --> 01:28:09,515
¶ shine on beauty ¶

1745
01:28:09,516 --> 01:28:12,017
[ humming ]

1746
01:28:15,389 --> 01:28:22,895
¶ 'cause it's darkest
before the dawn ¶

1747
01:28:22,896 --> 01:28:25,565
¶ I'm in the light,
I'm in the light ¶

1748
01:28:25,566 --> 01:28:28,034
¶ I'm in the light,
I'm in the light ¶

1749
01:28:28,035 --> 01:28:35,074
¶ and I know that
it's darkness before the dawn ¶
