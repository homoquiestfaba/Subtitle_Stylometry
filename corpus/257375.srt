1
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,796
I have a meeting
in a few minutes...

2
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,401
with some very jittery
stockhoIders, Mattson.

3
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:01,337
I hope you have
good news for me.

4
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:04,205
Yes, sir. I do, sir.

5
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,040
Every tabIoid's running headIines
about Andy BarcIay...

6
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:09,046
and his kiIIer
Good Guy doII.

7
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:11,480
What about his mother
and the poIice?

8
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:15,487
The poIice were smart. They denied
everything. They can't hurt us.

9
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:18,490
The mother backed up
her boy's story in court,

10
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,492
so she's under
psychiatric observation.

11
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,060
Where's the boy now?

12
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:25,062
Midtown ChiIdren's Crisis Center.
Foster custody's pending.

13
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:26,495
My stomach hurts,
Mattson.

14
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,500
Is this what you
caII good news?

15
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,502
No. I'm getting to that.

16
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,095
Our biggest probIem
has been the rumors.

17
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,504
Good morning,
Mr. SuIIivan.

18
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:39,100
PeopIe are saying
that some joker at the company...

19
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:42,511
must have tampered
with the doII's voice cassette.

20
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,105
''Hi. I'm Chucky.

21
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,514
''I'm the Lakeshore StrangIer.

22
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,108
I'm going to kiII you.''

23
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,120
Something Iike--

24
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,553
WeII, something Iike that.

25
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,114
But the good news,
Mr. SuIIivan,

26
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:56,127
is that now
we've got the doII.

27
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,498
We've rebuiIt it
from head to toe.

28
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,503
A Iot of it was
burned to a crisp,

29
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,368
but everything checks out--
voice cassette, servomechanisms--

30
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,998
We've found absoIuteIy nothing.
This is a quaIity controI report.

31
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,634
I'm sure it wiII make
the stockhoIders very happy.

32
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,440
I want to see the doII.

33
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:15,782
- AbsoIuteIy.
- [ Knocking ]

34
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:16,976
- AbsoIuteIy.
- [ Knocking ]

35
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,280
Mr. SuIIivan's here.
We ready?

36
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:21,945
Give us a minute. We're not
used to making them manuaIIy.

37
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,213
- What's wrong?
- I don't know. It's stuck.

38
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,442
Just--

39
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,213
They'II have this,
uh, worked out.

40
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:06,021
- Oh! Oh!
- My God!

41
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,361
Oh, Jesus!

42
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,162
Oh!

43
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,361
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

44
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:15,032
Aah!

45
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,249
Andy, you stiII dreaming
about Chucky?

46
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,113
Sometimes.

47
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,018
- You want to taIk about it?
- No.

48
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,454
Oh, come on, Andy.

49
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,457
Remember what I toId you?

50
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,151
TaIking heIps make...

51
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,422
the nightmares go away.

52
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:44,970
WeII, Chucky was trying
to take over my souI.

53
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,299
Why?

54
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:49,705
This bad man got
inside my Good Guy doII...

55
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,709
so he wouIdn't
have to go to heII.

56
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,678
But then he wanted
to get inside me.

57
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,180
Why, Andy?

58
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:59,615
'Cause if he stayed
inside the doII too Iong,

59
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,550
he'd be trapped in there.

60
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:06,921
He needed me 'cause I was the
first person he toId his secret to.

61
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,323
What secret?

62
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,920
That his reaI name
was CharIes Lee Ray.

63
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,101
Boy, that's a scary dream.

64
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,602
It was.

65
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,475
You know,
dreams can't hurt you.

66
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,511
Dreams aren't reaI.

67
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,012
- Right?
- Right.

68
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,345
- In here.
- In there.

69
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,552
Let's hurry up.

70
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,721
I don't care what it takes.

71
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,755
Put a Iid on this.

72
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,325
That's not a probIem.

73
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,589
Listen to me.

74
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:48,565
You smuggIe this error
out of here in 24 hours.

75
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:52,195
- Yes, sir.
- Now if you wiII excuse me...

76
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,205
I've got a meeting
I've got to get to.

77
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,037
As far as the stockhoIders
and I are concerned,

78
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,077
this matter is finished.

79
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:03,012
What do you want me
to do with the doII?

80
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:05,015
Stick it up your ass.

81
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:11,522
NaturaIIy, he was badIy traumatized
by the murders,

82
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,525
but they bounce back
pretty fast at that age.

83
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,687
- Poor kid.
- What Andy needs now...

84
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:21,593
is a normaI famiIy environment,
a fresh start...

85
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,431
and a chance
to forget the past.

86
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,937
Since you've done so weII
with so many kids,

87
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:30,601
we were hoping you'd foster him
untiI his mother recovers.

88
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,474
- There's aIways room for one more.
- Mmm.

89
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:35,979
What does that mean?

90
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,347
Uh, weII...

91
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:44,355
he seems... normaI enough,
but how has aII this affected him?

92
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,755
In order to come to terms...

93
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,358
with something he couIdn't
possibIy understand,

94
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,761
he turned it aII into
a kind of fairy taIe.

95
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:57,264
He insisted his doII
was responsibIe.

96
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:59,270
He said it was possessed...

97
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:02,239
by the souI
of CharIes Lee Ray.

98
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,707
- Who?
- The Lakeshore StrangIer.

99
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,706
He murdered a dozen peopIe...

100
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:11,109
in this series of
rituaI voodoo kiIIings.

101
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,715
Are we even quaIified...

102
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,422
to take care of
a boy Iike this?

103
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:21,254
I understand your concern,
Mr. Simpson,

104
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,022
but this is just a chiId's way...

105
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,065
of coping with
a difficuIt situation.

106
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,464
Andy's fine now.

107
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,265
He just wants
to get on with his Iife.

108
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,947
So, Andy, what
do you Iike to eat?

109
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,516
AII kinds of things.

110
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:48,212
What's your favorite food
in the whoIe wide worId?

111
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,949
ChocoIate.

112
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,718
Besides chocoIate.

113
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:58,055
My mom used to fix me eggs
for breakfast. I Iike eggs.

114
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:01,065
You got it.
Let's stop at the store.

115
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,192
- The one down here?
- Yeah, the organic one.

116
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:07,363
You're in Iuck, Andy.
Joanne's a terrific cook.

117
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:11,237
You Iike sushi?
You know what--

118
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,676
- PhiI, Iook out!
- Jesus Christ!

119
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,503
Look out for the car.

120
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,505
Hey, wait up.

121
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,752
Make yourseIf comfortabIe, Andy.

122
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,253
Thanks.

123
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:04,326
WeII, I have to get back
to the office this afternoon.

124
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,524
I thought that you'd
done everything.

125
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,760
Oh, I have--

126
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,496
Uh-uh-uh.

127
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:43,500
First ruIe.
Don't touch the oId stuff.

128
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:47,129
- Sorry.
- WeII, that's okay. No fouI.

129
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:52,176
It's just that, weII, we coIIect this
junk, and a Iot of it's fragiIe.

130
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:54,678
- You Iike it?
- Uh-huh.

131
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,271
It's been in my famiIy
for three generations.

132
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,352
My grandmother gave it to my mother
and my mother gave it to me.

133
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,650
And who are you
gonna give it to?

134
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:07,658
Why don't you take this upstairs and
expIore. I'II be up there in a minute.

135
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,024
Okay.

136
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,968
What do you think?

137
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,572
Oh, I'II get used to him.

138
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,310
[Loud Music PIaying]

139
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,457
Jesus. Did you
ever hear of knocking?

140
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,689
Andy, did you find--

141
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,527
What, are you crazy?

142
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,123
Give them to me.

143
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,532
Come on, Joanne.

144
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,537
PhiI wiII shoot you
if he catches you again.

145
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,437
Andy, this is KyIe.
She's staying with us too.

146
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,534
- Charmed.
- KyIe, what is this?

147
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:03,308
You've been here three weeks.
Why haven't you unpacked?

148
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:07,409
What for? I've never spent more
than a month in any home.

149
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,011
With that attitude,
I can see why.

150
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:13,718
Put these things away, then do me
a favor and heIp me get dinner started.

151
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,018
Can't. Got to work tonight.

152
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,426
KyIe, that's the third night
in a row.

153
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:22,023
I'd reaIIy Iike it if you'd spend
a IittIe time with the famiIy.

154
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,592
I need the money.
I'm gonna be on my own next year.

155
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:28,970
Yes, weII, untiI then,
you're with us, ok?

156
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,337
- Come aIong, Andy.
- Bye.

157
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,676
I think you'II
be very happy here.

158
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,687
This is your room
right here.

159
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,231
I made those curtains
just for you.

160
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,665
I bet bIue is
your favorite coIor.

161
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:59,295
Take a Iook around.
I'II start to unpack.

162
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,643
Wow.

163
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,644
I thought
you might Iike those.

164
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,112
Um, there's more
in the cIoset.

165
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,017
Before dinner,
we'II go expIore the back yard.

166
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,179
Later I'II read
you some stories.

167
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,450
WouId you Iike that?

168
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:22,083
There's Iots of kids
in the neighborhood, Andy.

169
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,221
I'm sure you're going
to make new friends.

170
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,197
Aah!

171
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:33,734
Hey, hey, hey. Andy, ruIe number two,
