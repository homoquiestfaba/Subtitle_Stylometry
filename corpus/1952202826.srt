1
00:00:32,169 --> 00:00:33,569
Dr Sammael ?

2
00:00:34,388 --> 00:00:36,188
Yes. May I help you ?

3
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:42,233
Excuse me but I'm finishing for today.

4
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:43,742
Melissa?

5
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:48,781
Dr Sammael, I'm gonna tell you
some really weird shit.

6
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:57,029
And you're gonna get real scared.

7
00:00:58,395 --> 00:00:59,995
What do you want ?

8
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:07,309
Point it toward me all the time.

9
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:19,292
I just need you to listen.

10
00:01:20,321 --> 00:01:21,921
I... I don't understand.

11
00:01:23,312 --> 00:01:27,712
I'm Asmodeus,
Torturer of the 13th level of Hell.

12
00:01:28,282 --> 00:01:29,482
I'm a demon.

13
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:33,692
All right...

14
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:36,669
It seems like we need to talk

15
00:01:38,154 --> 00:01:39,754
Why don't you have a seat ?

16
00:01:39,928 --> 00:01:41,028
Just like that ?

17
00:01:41,148 --> 00:01:42,948
A fucking demon walks in your office

18
00:01:42,949 --> 00:01:44,349
and does have a seat ?

19
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:48,471
I'm a little annoyed,
a bit frightened, but

20
00:01:48,472 --> 00:01:51,572
I am a trained professional,
Mr Asmodeus.

21
00:01:57,842 --> 00:01:59,342
Don't bother.
It's dead.

22
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,919
Now cut the shit,
I don't have much time.

23
00:02:05,457 --> 00:02:06,757
All right.

24
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:09,895
You're a demon.

25
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,470
- Is that your problem, Mr Asmodeus ?

26
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:16,971
Shut up and listen,
before I rip your fucking throat out !

27
00:02:20,976 --> 00:02:22,276
Let me give you some case history.

28
00:02:24,748 --> 00:02:26,948
Satan tricked me into selling my soul.

29
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,650
But I got a second chance a few months
ago when my mother died.

30
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,118
Satan offered me a chance
to escape the pit,

31
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:36,001
to become human again.

32
00:02:36,471 --> 00:02:37,471
As they say,

33
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,233
there's always a price.

34
00:02:47,747 --> 00:02:50,947
No, thanks.
And you shouldn't either, Albert.

35
00:02:50,948 --> 00:02:51,948
You really shouldn't.

36
00:02:53,842 --> 00:02:55,942
- That's all right, I'll have one.
- Thank you.

37
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:57,094
Thank you, Albert.

38
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:01,281
You know,
in the short time that I've been here,

39
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:04,082
I heard nothing but good things
about your wife Theresa.

40
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,251
That woman was a saint, Father Anthony.

41
00:03:09,052 --> 00:03:11,252
I just thank our Saviour in Heaven
that He took her

42
00:03:11,253 --> 00:03:13,253
before she had to suffer any longer.

43
00:03:14,926 --> 00:03:17,026
I know this is a very difficult time,

44
00:03:17,104 --> 00:03:19,804
but we do have to be out of here
by five o'clock,

45
00:03:19,836 --> 00:03:21,736
and it's nearly that time now.

46
00:03:22,258 --> 00:03:24,358
Are you kicking us out of
my mother's funeral ?

47
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:25,659
It's okay.

48
00:03:27,362 --> 00:03:29,262
Your mother is not here anymore.

49
00:03:29,837 --> 00:03:33,037
She's with your... brother Mark.

50
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:36,016
You know that, don't you, girls ?

51
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,630
- Mary-Elizabeth !
- Catherine.

52
00:03:58,631 --> 00:04:00,531
Catherine, let her go.

53
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,810
She needs the time.

54
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:32,384
Is it... Is somebody there ?

55
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:34,841
Is your baby all right ?

56
00:04:50,134 --> 00:04:51,634
Excuse-me !

57
00:05:00,484 --> 00:05:01,284
Wait !

58
00:05:12,964 --> 00:05:16,264
A baby... who lived only one day.

59
00:05:50,915 --> 00:05:51,615
Help !

60
00:05:52,446 --> 00:05:54,146
Mommy, help me !

61
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:28,567
No !

62
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,372
It's okay.

63
00:07:20,902 --> 00:07:21,802
It's okay.

64
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:24,347
I'm not gonna hurt you.

65
00:07:26,007 --> 00:07:27,607
I'm the caretaker here.

66
00:07:28,055 --> 00:07:29,755
Part-time, anyway.

67
00:07:29,996 --> 00:07:31,496
Ivan's my name.

68
00:07:32,517 --> 00:07:33,817
I'm Mary-Elizabeth.

69
00:07:34,248 --> 00:07:35,848
I'm sorry that I screamed.

70
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,155
It's okay.

71
00:07:37,434 --> 00:07:40,734
Imagine how I felt
the first time I looked in a mirror.

72
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,261
I was the vilest man I ever saw.

73
00:07:44,277 --> 00:07:45,677
"Mary-Elizabeth !"

74
00:07:46,561 --> 00:07:48,261
Do you know how worried we were ?

75
00:07:48,308 --> 00:07:51,508
Now, Mary-Elizabeth,
are you alright, sweetheart ?

76
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,680
I must have fallen asleep.

77
00:07:53,013 --> 00:07:55,413
Ivan Helped me. He's the caretaker.

78
00:07:55,801 --> 00:07:57,601
Part-time caretaker.

79
00:07:58,304 --> 00:08:02,204
I'm Albert...
I'm... Mary-Elizabeth's father,

80
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:04,805
that's why I...
want to thank you for your help.

81
00:08:05,455 --> 00:08:08,655
Oh, you're Theresa's family.

82
00:08:09,296 --> 00:08:11,096
I'm sorry for your loss.

83
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:14,552
- She was a real lady.
- Oh, thank you.

84
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:17,581
Look, do you need some extra work,

85
00:08:17,582 --> 00:08:21,482
because I could use two... strong hands
for helping around the house.

86
00:08:21,483 --> 00:08:24,783
I mean... especially now.

87
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:27,359
I could use the extra money.

88
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,274
G... Great !

89
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:34,689
You obviously believe that you're
a demon with supernatural abilities,

90
00:08:34,772 --> 00:08:38,872
and you... you seem genuinely
sorry for raping her sister.

91
00:08:39,855 --> 00:08:43,655
She was the only lady that
once ever gave a shit about me.

92
00:08:43,766 --> 00:08:46,566
Rest of them can burn
in fucking hell for all I care.

93
00:08:48,372 --> 00:08:53,372
Earlier you said that you were given
a chance by Satan to escape from Hell,

94
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:58,034
and to be born human again,
except there was a price.

95
00:08:58,715 --> 00:09:01,215
Was raping Mary-Elizabeth that price ?

96
00:09:01,345 --> 00:09:03,345
That was just the start.

97
00:09:05,284 --> 00:09:09,084
A lot of death and a birth had to happen
so I could become human again.

98
00:09:13,707 --> 00:09:15,007
Ah, jeez.

99
00:09:15,008 --> 00:09:16,808
- Mary-Elizabeth ?
- Here !

100
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:18,609
- Mary-Elizabeth !
- Come here, girl.

101
00:09:22,116 --> 00:09:23,816
Dad, I'll heat just some soup.

102
00:09:24,507 --> 00:09:32,107
- Oh, no. Thanks. I just need to p... p... p...
- P... puh... puh... puh...!

103
00:09:32,175 --> 00:09:36,375
Putter...around...your workshop.
Yeah, I know, I know.

104
00:09:42,175 --> 00:09:47,020
Come down after five minutes,
and have some soup, and your pills.

105
00:09:47,214 --> 00:09:49,114
I'm not a... child !

106
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:50,723
You know !

107
00:09:53,397 --> 00:09:55,097
I'm not a child !

108
00:10:01,706 --> 00:10:03,406
And spray some air-freshener
in there next time

109
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:05,107
you sneak for a smoke,

110
00:10:05,633 --> 00:10:06,533
little boy.

111
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:11,791
I heard that.

112
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:15,707
And Mary-Elizabeth,
you should have something.

113
00:10:16,925 --> 00:10:19,125
You know, you're not a model.

114
00:10:19,275 --> 00:10:20,375
You can eat.

115
00:10:21,183 --> 00:10:22,883
I'll be right back.

116
00:10:43,123 --> 00:10:45,923
900-MY-BITCH,
who am I talking to, please ?

117
00:10:46,456 --> 00:10:48,056
"I'm John. Who's this ?"

118
00:10:48,536 --> 00:10:54,936
Jen. Now John, I need
to read you a little disclaimer.

119
00:10:54,937 --> 00:11:02,237
And when I'm finished,
I need you to answer "Yes I agree",

120
00:11:02,838 --> 00:11:07,538
if you agree to all the
conditions of our agreement.

121
00:11:07,975 --> 00:11:09,075
Okay ?

122
00:11:09,438 --> 00:11:10,338
"Yes I agree."

123
00:11:10,526 --> 00:11:11,926
Not yet !

124
00:11:12,412 --> 00:11:17,412
Welcome to 900-MY-BITCH. At no time will you
make any threats about me or any other individual.

125
00:11:17,413 --> 00:11:20,313
- "Yes, I agree."
- Not yet.

126
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,640
You may never discuss topics such as humiliation,

127
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,641
personal degradation, cunnilingus,
anal penetration,

128
00:11:26,642 --> 00:11:29,642
vaginal penetration, oral sex
or any kind of sex,

129
00:11:29,643 --> 00:11:32,843
during the pre-screen portion of this call.

130
00:11:32,844 --> 00:11:35,644
Do you understand and agree to the terms
of the 900-MY-BITCH agreement ?

131
00:11:35,645 --> 00:11:36,245
"Now ?"

132
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:36,946
Yeah...

133
00:11:37,335 --> 00:11:39,535
"Yes, yes, I agree.
What are you wearing ?"

134
00:11:39,536 --> 00:11:40,936
What do you care, John, you little bitch ?

135
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:43,771
What the fuck is wrong with you, you little bitch ?

136
00:11:43,772 --> 00:11:45,672
Can't get it up without calling me ?

137
00:11:45,844 --> 00:11:46,644
Bitch !

138
00:11:46,645 --> 00:11:48,645
You probably have giants scabs
on your joined hands,

139
00:11:48,646 --> 00:11:51,646
stroking your deal, you worthless bitch !

140
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:53,747
Isn't that right, my bitch ?!

141
00:11:54,454 --> 00:11:56,554
"It's true. I am a worthless bitch..."

142
00:11:56,555 --> 00:11:57,255
<i>It's me.</i>

143
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:03,319
Listen, John, can you call back tomorrow ?

144
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,720
Same time, okay ?

145
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:06,621
Thank you for calling 900-MY-BITCH.

146
00:12:07,205 --> 00:12:10,105
Jen, you know, if Catherine finds out
about those phone calls,

147
00:12:10,205 --> 00:12:11,205
she's gonna kick you out so fast.

148
00:12:11,206 --> 00:12:13,606
Probably... How are you, sweetie ?

149
00:12:14,493 --> 00:12:16,693
You guys stayed a long time
after the funeral.

150
00:12:17,117 --> 00:12:18,217
You okay ?

151
00:12:18,376 --> 00:12:19,676
I don't know.

152
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:24,456
Did you ever have one of those dreams,
where you're falling and you can't stop ?

153
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:29,552
I feel that sensation all the time,
and I can't stop myself.

154
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,680
Jen, I don't want to live
without my mother.

155
00:12:33,764 --> 00:12:35,564
You're scaring me.

156
00:12:36,787 --> 00:12:39,287
You're going to be fine.

157
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:41,821
But it's gonna take some time.

158
00:12:47,115 --> 00:12:51,115
You're not going to charge me $3.99
a minute for the physical contact, right ?

159
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:54,806
I don't charge urgence,
you can have it for free !

160
00:13:00,763 --> 00:13:02,363
Stop it now, lesbo !

161
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,710
In your room !

162
00:13:12,647 --> 00:13:16,247
This is a Christian household and
I will not tolerate deviant behaviour.

163
00:13:16,572 --> 00:13:18,672
Catherine, we're just goofing around.

164
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:21,573
You're living under our roof for
next to nothing because of my mother.

165
00:13:21,895 --> 00:13:23,295
Well, my mother's gone now.

166
00:13:23,745 --> 00:13:26,545
And all she left me is a sick old stuttering father,

167
00:13:26,546 --> 00:13:29,146
and a fragile sister to take care of.

168
00:13:30,202 --> 00:13:32,702
So if you want to continue being my tenant,

169
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:35,241
watch your behaviour,

170
00:13:36,187 --> 00:13:38,187
and no more late night guests.

171
00:13:40,711 --> 00:13:41,711
Bitch.

172
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:04,249
Waky-waky !

173
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:09,049
Breakfast is on the table
for the next five minutes.

174
00:14:13,677 --> 00:14:15,377
No thanks, Catherine.

175
00:14:15,378 --> 00:14:19,278
I don't want any poached eggs,
wheat toast, cereals,...

176
00:14:22,812 --> 00:14:24,312
How do you know I made that ?

177
00:14:24,481 --> 00:14:25,581
We never have that.

178
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:31,369
Can't you smell it, Catherine ?
It's everywhere.

179
00:14:33,295 --> 00:14:36,395
Get up.
I want to go through Mom's things,

180
00:14:36,396 --> 00:14:37,796
and clean up the attic.

181
00:14:38,162 --> 00:14:43,562
Dad and that... Ivan the albino are...
working in the workshop.

182
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:46,441
You've four minutes left.

183
00:15:57,689 --> 00:15:59,089
Fifteen pounds !

184
00:16:06,705 --> 00:16:08,205
"Mary-Elizabeth, come to breakfast...

185
00:16:08,206 --> 00:16:10,106
now !

186
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:12,507
Oh Lord, you can't be sick today !

187
00:16:16,152 --> 00:16:17,552
What's wrong with you ?

188
00:16:20,298 --> 00:16:22,698
I gained fifteen pounds overnight.

189
00:16:23,378 --> 00:16:24,778
That's not possible.

190
00:16:30,826 --> 00:16:32,626
You're not pregnant, are you ?

191
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,900
I can't be, you know,
I've never even done it.

192
00:16:42,438 --> 00:16:44,838
- I don't even have a boyfriend.
- You're sick to your stomach,

193
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,454
you can smell a cold breakfast
all the way downstairs,

194
00:16:47,455 --> 00:16:50,355
and look at your stomach !
My God, look at it !

195
00:16:52,463 --> 00:16:54,763
I just...
I just must be sick, that's all.

196
00:16:55,437 --> 00:16:56,637
You'd better have a good explanation

197
00:16:56,638 --> 00:16:58,838
why you have all the symptoms
of a pregant woman.

198
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:05,166
I don't know.

199
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:09,256
Honestly, Catherine, I don't !

200
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:12,397
No !

201
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:15,189
No, Catherine,
I am not a little girl anymore.

202
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:19,190
Get on the bed ! I wanna know !
I wanna know, you slut,

203
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:20,591
whom you spread your legs for !

204
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:21,858
You little slut !

205
00:17:23,872 --> 00:17:24,772
Tell me !

206
00:17:28,621 --> 00:17:34,921
So, you's a doctor, uh, Albert ?
You... Doctor Albert.

207
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,620
Oh yeah, I was an obstetri... trician,

208
00:17:38,621 --> 00:17:40,521
before I contracted this...

209
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,600
lung problem.

210
00:17:42,856 --> 00:17:43,956
Oh really ?

211
00:17:44,057 --> 00:17:45,557
"whom you spread your legs for !"

212
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:46,558
"You little slut !"

213
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,559
- Hey, hey !
- "Tell me !"
- Keep it quiet down there !

214
00:17:53,157 --> 00:17:55,657
Get in there !
Get in the tub !

215
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:56,858
- I'm gonna show you...
- Catherine, no !

216
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,660
- Oh yes ! You liked it, uh !
- No !

217
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,061
- Sit there !
- No !

218
00:18:02,692 --> 00:18:07,292
- You wanted it ! You enjoyed it !
- No, no !

219
00:18:08,282 --> 00:18:12,582
You wanted to feel it, the filthy,
filthy little pig inside your body !

220
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,083
- Nooooo !
- You enjoyed it !

221
00:18:14,496 --> 00:18:18,296
How could you ?
A bastard into this family ?

222
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,600
Tell me who did this to our family ?

223
00:18:21,452 --> 00:18:22,352
Tell me !

224
00:18:22,723 --> 00:18:26,023
- Tell me who did this to you !
- I'm a virgin, I swear !

225
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,050
Tell me !

226
00:18:30,561 --> 00:18:31,961
Catherine ! Stop it !

227
00:18:32,088 --> 00:18:35,988
- Right now !
- Pregnant, she's pregnant ! Tell...

228
00:18:36,093 --> 00:18:38,193
Leaver her alone !
Leave her alone !

229
00:18:42,866 --> 00:18:43,966
It's all right.

230
00:18:45,005 --> 00:18:46,205
It's all right, Mary-Elizabeth.

231
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,562
Tell me about Mary-Elizabeth.

232
00:19:00,754 --> 00:19:02,154
You think she's the host ?

233
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,424
She might be the one.

234
00:19:07,797 --> 00:19:09,897
Look, Father,

235
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:11,816
I know for a fact

236
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:15,317
she's never had any type of sexual
intercourse with anyone.

237
00:19:15,894 --> 00:19:18,594
She's told me everything,
her entire life, in the confessional.

238
00:19:18,962 --> 00:19:21,062
I doubt she's even been kissed.

239
00:19:21,197 --> 00:19:23,597
Demons plant their seed mystically.

240
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,805
And always with a virgin.

241
00:19:26,654 --> 00:19:29,054
You saw how Mary-Elizabeth
was at the cemetery.

242
00:19:30,651 --> 00:19:34,051
And the Cardinal says a demon child
will be born on November 1st.

243
00:19:34,084 --> 00:19:36,584
November 1st, the Day of the Dead.

244
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:40,179
The only that Death is
actually celebrated,

245
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,400
that demons can actually be reborn,
here on Earth.

246
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:44,909
The Day of the Dead.

247
00:19:46,024 --> 00:19:47,724
What's going to happen
to the pregnant girl ?

248
00:19:49,585 --> 00:19:51,985
Follow the Cardinal's orders.

249
00:19:53,802 --> 00:19:55,502
That's something you don't see everyday.

250
00:19:57,603 --> 00:19:59,703
Priest packing E ?

251
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:05,302
Some problems require more
than prayers and holy water.

252
00:20:06,486 --> 00:20:08,586
Mary-Elizabeth isn't a problem.

253
00:20:08,797 --> 00:20:11,697
She's an innocent human being
who just buried her mother.

254
00:20:11,734 --> 00:20:14,734
Nick, I know you're emotionally
attached, but...

255
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:16,435
Look, I'm gonna do my part,

256
00:20:16,436 --> 00:20:19,736
but I'm not going to bury
my head in the sand either.

257
00:20:21,819 --> 00:20:23,819
Is this girl's family going to be hurt ?

258
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,590
The demon's unborn child

259
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:33,891
is going to force
Mary-Elizabeth to kill six people.

260
00:20:34,527 --> 00:20:35,827
I've been ordered to observe.

261
00:20:35,898 --> 00:20:38,998
Only I can't do anything
until the child is born.

262
00:20:47,003 --> 00:20:48,003
That's insane.

263
00:20:48,837 --> 00:20:50,737
Six innocent people will die.

264
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,583
And then you'll probably pay a visit

265
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,684
to Mary-Elizabeth and her baby with...

266
00:20:54,685 --> 00:20:56,885
your pistol, your Bible...

267
00:20:57,949 --> 00:21:00,149
And you don't seem to
have a problem with that.

268
00:21:04,186 --> 00:21:06,186
I'm a professional doing a job.

269
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,040
No. I don't know who you were
before you joined the Holy Order,

270
00:21:10,498 --> 00:21:12,598
but you are not a man of God.

271
00:21:13,511 --> 00:21:14,711
You're an assassin.

272
00:21:18,785 --> 00:21:22,585
Tell the Cardinal,
I won't be an accomplice.

273
00:21:29,813 --> 00:21:33,813
This... is a medical miracle.

274
00:21:33,949 --> 00:21:36,149
Let's go down to business, father.

275
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:40,459
Now, is she or isn't she ?

276
00:21:40,657 --> 00:21:43,457
According to the test... yes.

277
00:21:43,782 --> 00:21:44,582
Yes.

278
00:21:44,966 --> 00:21:46,566
But that's not possible.

279
00:21:46,643 --> 00:21:47,643
I believe you.

280
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:50,882
I mean, your hymen is unbroken
and I don't understand.

281
00:21:50,883 --> 00:21:55,283
You are the... first pregnant
virgin I've ever heard of !

282
00:21:55,511 --> 00:21:56,811
Not the first, father.

283
00:21:56,899 --> 00:22:00,199
Not the first.
Maybe it's a divine intervention.

284
00:22:00,296 --> 00:22:01,096
Why not ?

285
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:05,399
Maybe it's mother's soul
coming back to us, or... or...

286
00:22:05,747 --> 00:22:07,247
it's the second coming.

287
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,380
How do you explain her gaining
fifteen pounds overnight ?

288
00:22:10,526 --> 00:22:12,826
It could be, uh... toxemia.

289
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:14,627
What's that ? Do I have that ?

290
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:17,469
What about her nose ?
She smells better than a dog.

291
00:22:17,494 --> 00:22:19,594
I don't know. I just don't know.

292
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:25,308
I mean, it could be a nasal receptor,
or an olfactory nerve,

293
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:28,109
overcompensating for
some of the conditions.

294
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,410
What about the hymen ? How do you explain

295
00:22:30,411 --> 00:22:32,911
a woman getting pregnant
with an unbroken hymen ?

296
00:22:34,575 --> 00:22:35,275
Mary, are you alright ?

297
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:38,755
- Mary ?
- No, I don't. Can you please leave ?

298
00:22:38,756 --> 00:22:40,356
Leave ? But we live here.

299
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:42,893
Get the fuck outta my room !

300
00:22:43,865 --> 00:22:45,765
That language is unacceptable.

301
00:22:45,842 --> 00:22:48,242
What're you gonna do ? Ah, Catherine ?

302
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:50,243
Try and drown me again
like a bag of kittens ?

303
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:52,045
Go ahead ! I don't care.

304
00:22:52,394 --> 00:22:55,094
I really don't, because none of this
makes sense to me anymore,

305
00:22:55,095 --> 00:22:58,495
and I can't take any of it,
especially you !

306
00:22:59,014 --> 00:23:02,414
Come on, Cath... Catherine, let your
sister rest. Let's go, let's go.

307
00:23:04,695 --> 00:23:06,495
We'll figure this out, Mary.

308
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:11,157
We will.

309
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:32,110
"Hi, this is Jennifer.
Leave a message."

310
00:23:32,272 --> 00:23:40,272
Hi Jen. It's me.
I was just calling to say I'm sorry.

311
00:23:41,614 --> 00:23:46,714
Ah... Please tell my dad that I love him.

312
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,610
And I'm so sorry.

313
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:53,646
I just want...
I just wanna stop falling.

314
00:23:54,673 --> 00:23:56,373
Thanks for being a friend.

315
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,420
Crap !

316
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,600
Sing, do something
to keep yourself awake.

317
00:24:05,891 --> 00:24:08,591
Uh, an original then.
Let's see...

318
00:24:09,112 --> 00:24:12,812
<i>Driving back home to my baby...</i>

319
00:24:12,813 --> 00:24:16,813
<i>'cause that's where my baby will be.</i>

320
00:24:23,217 --> 00:24:25,717
Hail Mary,
full of grace.

321
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:28,139
Our Lord is with thee.

322
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:31,119
Blessed art thou among women,

323
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,420
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
Jesus.

324
00:24:34,136 --> 00:24:36,136
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

325
00:24:36,882 --> 00:24:39,982
pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

326
00:24:55,467 --> 00:24:57,267
Mama !

327
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,591
Mama.

328
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:30,519
Call 9-1-1 !

329
00:25:31,803 --> 00:25:33,403
Did you hear me ?

330
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,200
What the fuck is that ?

331
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:25,030
Hello, stranger.

332
00:26:35,516 --> 00:26:38,916
Forever, little sister, forever.

333
00:28:02,344 --> 00:28:05,644
Nothing. Nothing !

334
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,059
Fuck !

335
00:28:19,189 --> 00:28:20,189
Shit !

336
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:31,998
What's this ?

337
00:28:33,243 --> 00:28:35,143
Well, you're eating for two,
now, aren't you ?

338
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:38,016
You're wondering if I'm
gonna have the baby.

339
00:28:40,015 --> 00:28:41,015
I am.

340
00:28:43,214 --> 00:28:45,014
Alleluia.

341
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:46,515
She's having the baby.

342
00:28:46,788 --> 00:28:48,288
She's having the baby.

343
00:28:48,447 --> 00:28:50,547
Everything seems different this morning.

344
00:28:50,632 --> 00:28:54,232
I don't know. Last night I...
I didn't want to live, and now...

345
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:57,733
I feel... rejuvenated !
Alive !

346
00:28:57,734 --> 00:28:58,934
It's God's will.

347
00:28:59,325 --> 00:29:02,025
But it has to remain a secret
until the baby's born.

348
00:29:02,297 --> 00:29:04,797
Now, Dad can take care
of all your prenatal care,

349
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:07,698
and I can help you have
a safe home delivery.

350
00:29:07,891 --> 00:29:10,291
I mean, I've helped Dad
so many times in the past,

351
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:13,109
and believe me,
homeopathic care is best.

352
00:29:41,511 --> 00:29:42,511
Gin !

353
00:29:46,402 --> 00:29:49,802
Hey you, crazy bastard, get in here.

354
00:29:51,097 --> 00:29:53,397
Mary-Elizabeth, this is Lars.

355
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,840
My personal entertainment consultant.

356
00:29:57,469 --> 00:30:01,269
I'm not, I'm your personal sex slave.

357
00:30:06,354 --> 00:30:08,054
Do you think she wants to join us ?

358
00:30:16,937 --> 00:30:20,537
Father Anthony,
any luck with the lightbulb ?

359
00:30:21,455 --> 00:30:24,455
I fixed it.
Just a short.

360
00:30:24,786 --> 00:30:26,486
Electronics is my hobby.

361
00:30:27,186 --> 00:30:28,986
Oh, would you like me
to check the rest of the house ?

362
00:30:29,137 --> 00:30:31,437
- I've got my gear in the car.
- Would you ?             - Sure.

363
00:30:31,438 --> 00:30:33,938
That'd be a great time after
we return from the cemetery.

364
00:30:34,219 --> 00:30:36,919
- This place is like a death trap.
- Okay.

365
00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:46,499
<i>Second month.
June 1.</i>

366
00:30:46,508 --> 00:30:47,808
<i>Still missing your Mom.</i>

367
00:30:48,185 --> 00:30:50,385
<i>The baby seems to be doing fine and Dad says</i>

368
00:30:50,386 --> 00:30:52,386
<i>he can't believe my rapid development.</i>

369
00:30:52,722 --> 00:30:56,522
<i>My belly has gotten huge in no time,
but that's okay.</i>

370
00:30:56,801 --> 00:30:58,801
<i>I'm starting to feel
like a mother already.</i>

371
00:30:59,987 --> 00:31:01,687
<i>I still don't know how
I became pregnant,</i>

372
00:31:01,688 --> 00:31:03,988
<i>and I'm scared by some
of the other symptoms,</i>

373
00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:06,489
<i>but excited by my bizarre cravings.</i>

374
00:31:07,035 --> 00:31:09,335
<i>I'm ashamed to admit it, but it's true.</i>

375
00:31:10,189 --> 00:31:13,389
<i>Catherine won't let anyone else see me,
to protect the family reputation.</i>

376
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:16,259
<i>But I guess Catherine knows what's best.</i>

377
00:31:18,282 --> 00:31:19,582
Okay... ready.

378
00:31:19,683 --> 00:31:25,408
- Let's take a... picture.
- Sure.

379
00:31:25,692 --> 00:31:26,792
All around, Mary.

380
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,690
Look.

381
00:31:37,974 --> 00:31:40,874
Oh my God, Dad...

382
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:44,719
It's just like you said.

383
00:31:45,494 --> 00:31:46,894
Just nothing to worry about.

384
00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:53,401
Listen... I...'m sorry, sweetheart.

385
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:59,841
I... just don't want... to fail you,
like I did your mother and your brother.

386
00:31:59,983 --> 00:32:02,383
Dad... you've never failed anyone.

387
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:04,619
I wonder.

388
00:32:08,488 --> 00:32:12,288
Okay.
How... How's your energy level ?

389
00:32:13,415 --> 00:32:16,215
I thought I'd feel drained, but I don't.

390
00:32:16,838 --> 00:32:18,338
Actually, I feel really pumped.

391
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:24,109
You... wouldn't stay
in a shell this last month,

392
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,710
standing up for yourself, Mary,

393
00:32:26,127 --> 00:32:27,627
and that's a good thing.

394
00:32:29,891 --> 00:32:35,991
You know, this... pregnancy, seems to have
a positive effect on you.

395
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:38,950
- Flatterer !
- Yourself.

396
00:32:42,675 --> 00:32:45,275
You just rest, ah ? Too much talk here.

397
00:32:46,477 --> 00:32:49,877
I'm... gonna have a little...uh...
Shhh.

398
00:32:55,186 --> 00:32:56,886
What's this ?
The foetus channel ?

399
00:32:57,724 --> 00:32:58,824
Any cravings yet ?

400
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,730
My God... yes.

401
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,280
All my body has been doing
some very strange things.

402
00:33:04,856 --> 00:33:07,656
My sex drive is insane.

403
00:33:07,955 --> 00:33:09,555
Getting really horny.

404
00:33:10,819 --> 00:33:13,719
You can borrow my pocket rocket,

405
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,320
be careful, it's worse than a real one.

406
00:33:15,798 --> 00:33:17,698
No, no.
Get it off.

407
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:45,339
Come here girl !
Come get a treat !

408
00:33:47,866 --> 00:33:48,766
Is that for me ?

409
00:34:21,487 --> 00:34:22,887
- Hey !
- Hey, what's up ?

410
00:34:22,888 --> 00:34:24,888
Uh, I need something,
do you have a minute ?

411
00:34:24,986 --> 00:34:27,586
- Okay, what's up ?
- I need sex.

412
00:34:28,038 --> 00:34:32,257
"I need sex." Who are you and what
the hell have you done with my friend ?

413
00:34:32,258 --> 00:34:34,258
- What is going on here ?
- I can't explain it.

414
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:37,176
Although I feel like, if I don't have sex,
I'm going to kill someone.

415
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,130
Why don't you phone the mystery man

416
00:34:39,131 --> 00:34:40,431
and tell him to come back
for a body call ?

417
00:34:40,432 --> 00:34:41,532
I can't.

418
00:34:42,798 --> 00:34:43,698
Who is he, anyway ?

419
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:45,748
Why do you keep it secret ?

420
00:34:46,026 --> 00:34:46,726
I just...

421
00:34:48,996 --> 00:34:49,996
I just can't say it, all right ?

422
00:34:51,981 --> 00:34:53,081
It doesn't matter.

423
00:34:55,455 --> 00:34:57,055
Oh my God,

424
00:34:57,056 --> 00:35:01,856
Mary-Elizabeth wants
to fuck my fuck-buddy !

425
00:35:04,091 --> 00:35:05,091
Thank you.

426
00:35:24,714 --> 00:35:26,014
Pretty nice place.

427
00:35:26,797 --> 00:35:28,697
But you should think
about getting a plasma.

428
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,940
I'm going to leave my business
card with my home number.

429
00:35:31,753 --> 00:35:33,710
Can get you a great deal on HDTV.

430
00:35:35,437 --> 00:35:36,837
Would you like a beer ?

431
00:35:37,507 --> 00:35:39,107
No. Just you.

432
00:35:40,803 --> 00:35:41,703
We have wine--

433
00:35:41,704 --> 00:35:46,304
"--if you'd prefer.
- Jesus, Mary-Elizabeth, I don't wanna get drunk."

434
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,870
"Do you know how cute--"
you are ?

435
00:36:11,152 --> 00:36:13,552
Come on, keep it in your pants,
get out of there.

436
00:36:17,907 --> 00:36:19,307
I've never done this before.

437
00:36:19,308 --> 00:36:21,508
It's okay, baby, I'll be gentle.

438
00:36:22,103 --> 00:36:23,503
Can we go to bed now ?

439
00:36:27,664 --> 00:36:29,064
Take me from behind.

440
00:36:29,502 --> 00:36:30,302
Quickly !

441
00:36:35,544 --> 00:36:37,844
- Do you want me to stop ?
- No !

442
00:36:46,077 --> 00:36:46,977
Give it to me !

443
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:50,315
Give it to me !

444
00:36:55,082 --> 00:36:55,982
"Give it to me !"

445
00:36:58,181 --> 00:36:59,081
"Give it to me !"

446
00:37:03,866 --> 00:37:07,666
Give it to me ! Give it to me !
Give it to me !

447
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,990
Alright, oh !

448
00:37:31,053 --> 00:37:32,953
Hello, lover.

449
00:37:41,727 --> 00:37:43,227
Stop this ! Something is poking me !

450
00:37:43,712 --> 00:37:46,512
Come on, you little naughty !

451
00:37:47,013 --> 00:37:52,013
- Faster, faster !
- No ! No ! Aagh !

452
00:37:54,708 --> 00:37:55,908
Please !

453
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:09,500
No ! No ! Help ! Help !

454
00:38:09,501 --> 00:38:13,201
Please, help !

455
00:38:13,202 --> 00:38:21,702
No, please, help !
Stop, please !

456
00:38:27,704 --> 00:38:28,904
Oh fuck !

457
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:49,199
What the fuck did you do to me,
you freak ?!

458
00:38:50,212 --> 00:38:53,212
You're missing something, Lars ?

459
00:39:26,912 --> 00:39:29,312
Are you hungry, baby ?

460
00:39:31,613 --> 00:39:35,613
Yes mama, baby very hungry.

461
00:39:36,145 --> 00:39:41,045
Eat, and baby be born,
baby be born !

462
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:54,484
Auf wiedersehen, baby.

463
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:17,759
So these killings were supposed
to make you human ?

464
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:22,185
Yeah. Make the blood flow again.

465
00:40:22,845 --> 00:40:26,645
It wasn't working even though
my little sister was doing her best.

466
00:41:22,576 --> 00:41:23,576
Please.

467
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:27,693
The vessel

468
00:41:28,198 --> 00:41:30,998
is the... is the window

469
00:41:31,595 --> 00:41:33,295
to the soul.

470
00:41:33,774 --> 00:41:38,074
And Daddy needs me to be born, mother !

471
00:41:38,814 --> 00:41:43,014
Think of it as prenatal care.

472
00:41:43,275 --> 00:41:45,275
Now eat the sacred heart !

473
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:50,220
- No.
- Drink its blood.

474
00:41:50,397 --> 00:41:53,397
- I can't !
- Why not ?!

475
00:41:53,869 --> 00:41:56,069
Everyone eats flesh.

476
00:41:56,455 --> 00:42:00,055
Animal or human, there's no difference !

477
00:42:00,556 --> 00:42:04,956
- Flesh is flesh.
- It's wrong !

478
00:42:06,638 --> 00:42:08,038
But I want it.

479
00:42:10,035 --> 00:42:14,035
Didn't your saviour
tell his apostles to eat his flesh ?!

480
00:42:14,036 --> 00:42:16,036
Drink his blood ?!

481
00:42:16,557 --> 00:42:20,357
Don't you do that every Sunday at Mass ?

482
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:22,013
Now eat !

483
00:42:41,429 --> 00:42:42,929
Drink !

484
00:42:52,204 --> 00:42:54,804
Finish the rest.

485
00:43:02,503 --> 00:43:05,103
"Please make your report, Father."

486
00:43:06,189 --> 00:43:09,589
Cardinal Buenaventura,
it's an honour, sir.

487
00:43:13,874 --> 00:43:17,474
The host still has no idea
she's carrying a demon's child.

488
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:20,160
Her physical development is rapid.

489
00:43:21,705 --> 00:43:24,105
The feedings have been limited to one

490
00:43:24,927 --> 00:43:28,727
sacrifice per month, as expected.

491
00:43:29,229 --> 00:43:32,229
Your Eminence, I... I just dont understand

492
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:35,230
why we don't go in and
terminate the pregnancy now.

493
00:43:35,535 --> 00:43:38,592
We can save the host and
stop the birth of this demon's child.

494
00:43:39,035 --> 00:43:41,635
"You can't stop it till the moment
the creature is born."

495
00:43:42,112 --> 00:43:44,212
"It's only vulnerable during birth."

496
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:51,699
But there's nothing mentioned in the Scriptures

497
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:55,400
about Satan's demon trying to sire a child
on Earth on the Day of the Dead.

498
00:43:56,062 --> 00:43:58,262
"Would you have us yell fire
in a crowded theatre ?"

499
00:43:58,854 --> 00:44:02,054
"There is a reason these goings
must be allowed, Father, trust me."

500
00:44:02,578 --> 00:44:04,278
"All will be revealed."

501
00:44:05,003 --> 00:44:07,403
"I know that this task
must be difficult for you,

502
00:44:07,404 --> 00:44:09,904
"considering your conversion
from the military to the Church.

503
00:44:11,001 --> 00:44:13,201
"But you truly are
the best man for the job.

504
00:44:14,093 --> 00:44:16,493
"Give Father Nicholas my regards."

505
00:44:18,724 --> 00:44:22,124
Thank you, your Eminence.
I will.

506
00:44:28,678 --> 00:44:31,178
<i>Third month.
July 1st.</i>

507
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:34,358
<i>My dreams have become
stranger and stranger.</i>

508
00:44:35,307 --> 00:44:38,407
<i>Sometimes I'm not sure
what's a dream and what's real.</i>

509
00:44:38,502 --> 00:44:41,002
<i>It's as if someone else has taken
control of my body.</i>

510
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:44,010
<i>Dad assures me that
I shouldn't be frightened by</i>

511
00:44:44,179 --> 00:44:47,479
<i>my extreme mood swings
and cravings, but I am.</i>

512
00:44:47,545 --> 00:44:49,345
<i>I disgust myself.</i>

513
00:44:49,826 --> 00:44:53,826
<i>But I pray that everything will return
to normal after the baby's born.</i>

514
00:45:00,575 --> 00:45:02,175
Mary-Elizabeth,

515
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:04,025
it does your mother well.

516
00:45:05,638 --> 00:45:07,138
It's perfect.

517
00:45:07,152 --> 00:45:08,452
Thank you, Ivan

518
00:45:13,576 --> 00:45:15,376
Loom me up, Mommy.

519
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:19,785
You ain't seen Lars lately ?

520
00:45:21,929 --> 00:45:24,629
I called him a couple of times
but he never called me back.

521
00:45:25,436 --> 00:45:28,036
Sometimes, he just disappears.

522
00:45:28,807 --> 00:45:31,507
This rich divorcée whom
he met at a coffee-house one time,

523
00:45:31,449 --> 00:45:34,249
next day, they flew
to Cancun for a month.

524
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:35,681
Forget him !

525
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,380
You wanna go out tomorrow night ?

526
00:45:39,635 --> 00:45:42,235
I am getting half nuts in my cave.

527
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:45,231
But Catherine doesn't want
anyone to see me like this.

528
00:45:45,232 --> 00:45:49,332
Jesus ! You're pregnant,
you don't have a lepracy.

529
00:45:50,074 --> 00:45:51,674
Look, we'll sneak out to a club,

530
00:45:51,675 --> 00:45:54,775
and I promise no-one
will know or see you.

531
00:45:55,337 --> 00:45:57,937
Your sister will never even know you've gone.
Come on !

532
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,189
My treat !

533
00:46:02,869 --> 00:46:03,969
Great, a club !

534
00:46:04,764 --> 00:46:07,164
What am I supposed to do ?
Make you look thinner ?

535
00:46:13,913 --> 00:46:15,813
Inside the house before someone sees you.

536
00:46:16,299 --> 00:46:19,499
And Jennifer, cover yourself up.
This isn't a nude beach.

537
00:46:19,801 --> 00:46:21,601
She's just sunbathing !

538
00:46:26,427 --> 00:46:29,127
Don't make excuses for her.
I know what she's doing.

539
00:46:29,803 --> 00:46:31,403
Now get inside.
Now !

540
00:46:34,097 --> 00:46:35,097
Now !

541
00:46:43,799 --> 00:46:44,499
What ?

542
00:46:44,641 --> 00:46:47,441
You wanna get something off your chest
before I evict you ?

543
00:46:48,573 --> 00:46:50,773
Do you see my hand trembling, Catherine ?

544
00:46:51,431 --> 00:46:53,231
It's trembling 'cause I wanna
jump down your throat,

545
00:46:53,232 --> 00:46:54,832
rip out your tongue
and strangle you with it.

546
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:57,533
So you'd better stay away
until I'm packed and out of here.

547
00:46:57,534 --> 00:46:59,934
You hear me, my bitch ?!

548
00:47:10,031 --> 00:47:11,931
I can't believe that you're
not living with us anymore.

549
00:47:11,932 --> 00:47:13,932
Well, it's only an hour drive.

550
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:18,050
Tonight, I wanna get shitfaced, free of charge.

551
00:47:18,051 --> 00:47:23,451
So all the drinks, alcoholic or otherwise,
are on the dude of the day. Got it ?

552
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:26,730
Are you sure the loud music's
not gonna hurt the baby ?

553
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:30,230
Nah. He's just gonna
dance the techno, that's all.

554
00:47:33,013 --> 00:47:35,213
It's just so weird !

555
00:47:35,938 --> 00:47:38,138
What do you say, baby ?
Yes, yes, yes.

556
00:47:44,707 --> 00:47:48,607
Sweetheart, is this a bun in the oven,
or some kind of growth ?

557
00:47:48,608 --> 00:47:51,808
No, it's a growth, like a
talking thing on your shoulders.

558
00:47:52,221 --> 00:47:54,821
Okay. You two, leave. Get out of the line.

559
00:47:54,822 --> 00:47:58,122
I mean because, she's either gotta
pop that thing or do like a billion abs.

560
00:47:58,235 --> 00:47:59,535
Go on.

561
00:47:59,623 --> 00:48:00,423
Come on, let's go.

562
00:48:00,604 --> 00:48:05,104
Hey, even pregnant she still looks hotter
than most of the skinks you let in here, nazi !

563
00:48:05,143 --> 00:48:06,843
Please Jen, let's just go.

564
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:15,959
- Mary ! Where're you going ?
- Just leave me alone.

565
00:48:17,441 --> 00:48:20,041
Come on ! You can't listen to jerks
like that. You're beautiful.

566
00:48:20,042 --> 00:48:24,542
No, I'm not. I'm a monster.
I'm a horrible monster.

567
00:48:24,543 --> 00:48:26,443
Look at me.

568
00:48:29,398 --> 00:48:30,398
Open your coat.

569
00:48:31,788 --> 00:48:32,788
Open it.

570
00:48:37,546 --> 00:48:40,846
Remember when Demi Moore was
pregnant and doing that magazine cover ?

571
00:48:40,847 --> 00:48:44,047
Superb. And so do you.

572
00:48:44,468 --> 00:48:45,468
I'do you !

573
00:48:52,365 --> 00:48:53,365
Jen...

574
00:49:00,762 --> 00:49:02,762
I can't bear to see you hurt.

575
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:47,909
Your kid's getting hasty.

576
00:49:48,857 --> 00:49:50,957
Hello, friend.

577
00:49:51,424 --> 00:49:53,024
Kiss my baby, Jen.

578
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:57,559
I said

579
00:49:58,494 --> 00:49:59,494
kiss

580
00:49:59,504 --> 00:50:00,504
my

581
00:50:00,966 --> 00:50:02,466
baby !

582
00:50:22,666 --> 00:50:26,466
You see, Jen, I'm the monster.

583
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:29,310
You're the beautiful one.

584
00:50:50,581 --> 00:50:52,881
Why can't I feel anything ?!

585
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,000
Why couldn't you feel anything ?

586
00:50:56,001 --> 00:50:58,701
Wasn't that part of your deal
with the devil ?

587
00:50:58,867 --> 00:51:00,167
To become human ?

588
00:51:00,423 --> 00:51:01,723
The deal was this :

589
00:51:03,285 --> 00:51:06,385
Satan lets me become human again
if I knock off my sister,

590
00:51:07,463 --> 00:51:09,363
force her to kill six people
during the pregnancy,

591
00:51:09,364 --> 00:51:11,164
and to give birth to my demon kid.

592
00:51:12,132 --> 00:51:13,432
Wait, wait, wait...

593
00:51:14,368 --> 00:51:16,068
What happens to your kid ?

594
00:51:16,596 --> 00:51:18,296
He raises chaos on Earth,

595
00:51:18,465 --> 00:51:21,565
and replaces me as
Hell's torturer when he dies.

596
00:51:22,217 --> 00:51:25,017
Every time she whacks someone,
I'm supposed to change,

597
00:51:25,118 --> 00:51:26,918
I'm supposed to feel something.

598
00:51:27,294 --> 00:51:28,794
But I'm not feeling shit !

599
00:51:29,331 --> 00:51:31,431
And I still look like shit !

600
00:51:32,844 --> 00:51:34,044
That's why I'm here.

601
00:51:35,614 --> 00:51:36,614
Try to figure out what's going on
in my fucking head

602
00:51:36,615 --> 00:51:38,915
before it's too late.

603
00:52:11,183 --> 00:52:12,383
Father ?

604
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:17,056
I... I didn't hurt this girl.
...romise.

605
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:19,026
It... It was the pregnant girl.

606
00:52:19,027 --> 00:52:20,827
I... I saw the whole thing.

607
00:52:21,707 --> 00:52:22,707
Here.

608
00:52:25,077 --> 00:52:27,177
Would you like to say
an act of contrition ?

609
00:52:29,376 --> 00:52:30,576
Whassa ?

610
00:52:32,394 --> 00:52:33,694
Never mind.

611
00:52:35,158 --> 00:52:36,458
Forgive me, Father,

612
00:52:38,941 --> 00:52:41,341
I'm truly sorry for
having offended Thee.

613
00:53:16,003 --> 00:53:18,903
Hello, miracle baby.

614
00:53:23,007 --> 00:53:24,407
That's what you are.

615
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:26,639
A miracle.

616
00:53:29,468 --> 00:53:31,168
I wish we knew your father.

617
00:53:34,531 --> 00:53:36,431
I think everything's gonna be alright.

618
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:44,270
Your Grandpa says he's not
sure about the delivery day,

619
00:53:44,271 --> 00:53:46,971
because you grew so fast !

620
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,308
I wish I knew when the big day is.

621
00:53:51,567 --> 00:53:55,467
If I knew, I'd have everything
ready for you when you arrive.

622
00:53:58,866 --> 00:54:02,666
Well, why don't you want to tell Mommy ?

623
00:54:03,827 --> 00:54:06,227
Come on, talk to Mommy.

624
00:55:08,811 --> 00:55:11,111
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

625
00:55:11,178 --> 00:55:14,278
It's been over three months
since my last confession.

626
00:55:14,279 --> 00:55:16,379
What's on your mind, Mary-Elizabeth ?

627
00:55:17,628 --> 00:55:19,328
Father Anthony,
I was hoping it was you.

628
00:55:19,329 --> 00:55:21,129
I... I don't know how to start.

629
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:26,230
I... I've been having visions and...
horrible, horrible dreams.

630
00:55:26,231 --> 00:55:28,931
I have one about you and
the day that we buried my mother.

631
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:33,509
Dreams allow us to acknowledge
the inner urges we repress

632
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:35,210
without actually acting on them.

633
00:55:35,645 --> 00:55:37,945
It's more than that.

634
00:55:37,546 --> 00:55:41,946
Terrible things are going to happen,
or have happened, I don't know.

635
00:55:42,279 --> 00:55:43,679
I don't know how to say this...

636
00:55:45,373 --> 00:55:50,473
a man, a truck driver,
he died in an accident, two months ago.

637
00:55:50,617 --> 00:55:53,317
But I dreamed about it
before I heard it on the news.

638
00:55:54,046 --> 00:55:59,046
In my dream, I killed that man
just as they described it.

639
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:03,666
- Are you confessing the murder of this man ?
- No !

640
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:07,150
I mean, I don't know.

641
00:56:07,485 --> 00:56:08,485
That's why I'm here, Father.

642
00:56:08,486 --> 00:56:12,086
I... I'm pregnant, but I was a virgin,

643
00:56:12,087 --> 00:56:13,787
and then, then I woke up one morning,

644
00:56:13,788 --> 00:56:16,688
and I was pregnant and all
these dreams and visions began,

645
00:56:16,689 --> 00:56:20,889
and I keep dreaming that I'm killing people.

646
00:56:23,267 --> 00:56:26,367
And the cravings, yes, yes, the cravings,

647
00:56:26,368 --> 00:56:31,668
and today...
today I saw my baby on the ultrasonic,

648
00:56:34,092 --> 00:56:37,892
- I mean... it...
- Yes ?

649
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:42,210
What did you see on the ultrasonic ?

650
00:56:46,046 --> 00:56:51,046
It branded me with some sort of symbol.

651
00:56:51,788 --> 00:56:55,688
A star... but then it disappeared.

652
00:56:57,078 --> 00:56:58,378
Pentagram.

653
00:57:03,606 --> 00:57:04,906
Father, did you hear me ?

654
00:57:05,539 --> 00:57:07,039
I'm listening.

655
00:57:08,217 --> 00:57:10,017
I know it sounds crazy.

656
00:57:10,018 --> 00:57:14,718
I sound crazy when I hear myself say it,
but that's why I can't tell my family,

657
00:57:14,719 --> 00:57:16,419
or even Father Nick.

658
00:57:17,298 --> 00:57:18,798
What do you think it is ?

659
00:57:20,423 --> 00:57:22,523
Catherine said it came from Heaven,

660
00:57:23,234 --> 00:57:25,034
but now I know the truth.

661
00:57:25,731 --> 00:57:27,731
It came from Hell.

662
00:57:31,149 --> 00:57:32,749
I believe you.

663
00:57:34,057 --> 00:57:36,657
- You do ?
- I do.

664
00:57:39,215 --> 00:57:45,615
Could I... really be pregnant
with... something... evil ?

665
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:48,150
Please, tell me what you really think.

666
00:57:49,514 --> 00:57:52,614
I think you may be suffering
from some type of mental illness.

667
00:57:53,057 --> 00:57:55,657
You may have even caught that
out of a traumatic sexual encounter

668
00:57:55,658 --> 00:57:57,758
that caused your pregnancy.

669
00:57:58,299 --> 00:58:00,299
But my dad examined me.

670
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:03,940
I'm sorry, Mary, but Albert hasn't
practised medicine in years.

671
00:58:03,941 --> 00:58:07,041
He... may have made a mistake
about you being a virgin.

672
00:58:09,386 --> 00:58:11,786
You said you believed me.

673
00:58:12,205 --> 00:58:16,005
Dreams and delusions,
they can seem like reality.

674
00:58:16,778 --> 00:58:20,978
But I burned my fingers
in the holy water !

675
00:58:22,317 --> 00:58:25,717
Our cleaning lady pours
scalding hot water

676
00:58:25,718 --> 00:58:27,518
in the holy water basins
at the end of each day.

677
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:29,119
She thinks she's cleansing everyone's germs.

678
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:31,720
She must have done it
just before you arrived.

679
00:58:31,907 --> 00:58:34,307
I'm sorry, Mary. I'm sorry.

680
00:58:47,042 --> 00:58:50,442
Your Eminence, I would like
to request a replacement.

681
00:58:50,855 --> 00:58:52,555
I've heard your report
about the homeless man,

682
00:58:52,556 --> 00:58:54,656
but that's an extreme situation.

683
00:58:55,616 --> 00:58:57,516
There's always collateral
damage during a war.

684
00:58:57,517 --> 00:59:00,617
You should know that better than anyone,
being a former soldier.

685
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:03,590
Your Eminence, I killed an innocent man,

686
00:59:04,488 --> 00:59:08,388
not as a government's field agent,
or as a soldier, but as a priest.

687
00:59:09,523 --> 00:59:13,223
I thought I'd left it all behind,
the killings, the assassinations.

688
00:59:13,617 --> 00:59:16,517
I rationalize my past sins
as patriotic duty.

689
00:59:17,527 --> 00:59:19,427
And now you have another going.

690
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:22,608
I enjoyed it.

691
00:59:23,168 --> 00:59:24,168
Why was that ?

692
00:59:24,428 --> 00:59:25,828
I had options...

693
00:59:26,939 --> 00:59:30,739
...but I...
missed the thrill of the kill.

694
00:59:31,763 --> 00:59:33,363
I can't lie to myself.

695
00:59:34,241 --> 00:59:35,641
I killed him because he saw too much,

696
00:59:35,642 --> 00:59:38,442
but I... enjoyed...

697
00:59:38,443 --> 00:59:40,343
killing that man.

698
00:59:40,836 --> 00:59:43,236
Once this mission is complete,
you have my permission

699
00:59:43,237 --> 00:59:45,437
to turn yourself over
to the proper authorities.

700
00:59:49,337 --> 00:59:51,337
Thank you, your Eminence.

701
00:59:52,094 --> 00:59:54,594
You're experiencing the same guilt

702
00:59:54,595 --> 00:59:57,095
and need for punishment
as Father Anthony.

703
00:59:57,856 --> 00:59:59,656
The both of you care for your sister

704
00:59:59,657 --> 01:00:02,257
and feel guilt over not
being able to protect her.

705
01:00:02,747 --> 01:00:06,447
I knew it.
I fucking knew it was all in my head.

706
01:00:07,052 --> 01:00:09,652
The clinical term is "psychosomatic".

707
01:00:10,369 --> 01:00:14,869
A person's disease fighting ability
weakens under stress.

708
01:00:15,063 --> 01:00:18,263
Like in a particularly
stressful situation.

709
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:21,090
As in raping your sister, for example.

710
01:00:21,747 --> 01:00:25,247
Bullshit ! I'm supposed to be
human again, that's the deal.

711
01:00:26,504 --> 01:00:30,404
You are experiencing
a human emotion : guilt !

712
01:00:31,362 --> 01:00:33,662
I don't know about a demon
that would do that.

713
01:00:34,728 --> 01:00:37,828
It's happening. Just slowly.

714
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:39,630
Or...

715
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:41,911
may I suggest that...

716
01:00:44,103 --> 01:00:48,003
maybe you never really were
a demon to begin with.

717
01:00:49,652 --> 01:00:52,252
Oh, I'm a demon, Dr Sammael.

718
01:00:53,446 --> 01:00:55,546
And I care to look only for number one,

719
01:00:55,673 --> 01:00:59,773
because I got one shot at
coming back a 100%.

720
01:01:00,207 --> 01:01:03,307
Please, Mr Asmodeus, sit down.

721
01:01:03,486 --> 01:01:05,486
We're making real progress here.

722
01:01:19,705 --> 01:01:22,905
I told you, Dr Sammael, I'm a demon.

723
01:01:23,949 --> 01:01:26,849
And you can't kill demons with bullets.

724
01:01:27,057 --> 01:01:28,957
Stupid bitch !

725
01:01:36,654 --> 01:01:39,454
<i>Fourth month.
August 1st.</i>

726
01:01:39,687 --> 01:01:42,887
<i>Every ultrasonic so far has been
back to normal since my delusion.</i>

727
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:45,430
<i>Thank God, the dreams have stopped too.</i>

728
01:01:46,014 --> 01:01:50,314
<i>Everything is normal, except the baby's
still growing at an incredible rate.</i>

729
01:01:50,594 --> 01:01:53,294
<i>Dad says that does happen
to a small percentage of women.</i>

730
01:01:53,356 --> 01:01:55,756
<i>But I think that's kinda weird.</i>

731
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:58,810
<i>Still haven't heard from Jen
since that night at the club.</i>

732
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:00,659
<i>Guess she's busy.</i>

733
01:02:30,398 --> 01:02:32,698
Waky waky Mommy !

734
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:35,140
Baby hungry !

735
01:02:47,737 --> 01:02:48,937
Oh my God !

736
01:02:49,856 --> 01:02:51,456
"Oh my God !
No !"

737
01:02:52,554 --> 01:02:54,554
Hungry, Mama...

738
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:56,705
Hungry...

739
01:02:57,003 --> 01:03:00,203
Feed me, fucking sow, I'm hungry !

740
01:03:23,622 --> 01:03:24,622
Shit.

741
01:03:24,955 --> 01:03:26,055
The mike...

742
01:03:37,786 --> 01:03:41,186
I'm gonna let you stay awake
for this one, Mommy !

743
01:03:41,237 --> 01:03:46,237
I wanna savour your fear.
Feed on it.

744
01:03:46,473 --> 01:03:49,873
And your daddy's heart at the same time.

745
01:03:54,837 --> 01:03:56,037
No !

746
01:03:56,857 --> 01:03:58,357
I won't let you.

747
01:04:06,295 --> 01:04:09,395
Bitch !
You can't stop me now.

748
01:04:10,094 --> 01:04:13,494
I'm already in my third trimester !

749
01:04:13,542 --> 01:04:17,842
You've made me strong
with all that fresh meat, Mommy.

750
01:04:24,769 --> 01:04:26,969
Who's slamming doors at this time ?

751
01:04:30,711 --> 01:04:35,011
And do you remember
the feedings now, Mommy ?

752
01:04:38,612 --> 01:04:42,212
I can smell that old goat
smoke downstairs.

753
01:04:54,421 --> 01:04:56,121
How're you feeling, sweetheart ?

754
01:04:57,127 --> 01:05:00,627
This is gonna be
one nasty feeding, Mommy.

755
01:05:00,824 --> 01:05:03,224
I hope you brought a puke bag.

756
01:05:04,006 --> 01:05:06,406
No !
No.

757
01:05:06,971 --> 01:05:08,571
I won't let you.

758
01:05:09,493 --> 01:05:10,793
You sound like you need...

759
01:05:10,794 --> 01:05:14,294
some honey or a cup... cup of...

760
01:05:15,779 --> 01:05:18,079
Hello grandpa !

761
01:05:21,077 --> 01:05:25,277
Or should I say stuttering supper ?

762
01:05:32,242 --> 01:05:33,242
God !

763
01:05:44,855 --> 01:05:46,355
No !

764
01:05:49,892 --> 01:05:51,492
Well, come on !

765
01:06:06,646 --> 01:06:07,646
What is that...

766
01:06:08,287 --> 01:06:09,687
thing ?

767
01:06:09,688 --> 01:06:11,988
Oh Daddy ! Kill it !

768
01:06:12,595 --> 01:06:15,295
Kill this monster inside me !

769
01:06:15,985 --> 01:06:19,485
I don't... I don't understand !

770
01:06:20,423 --> 01:06:25,123
Daddy please ! Get what you need.
Use that thing.

771
01:06:25,097 --> 01:06:26,897
Hit it ! Hit it !

772
01:06:27,123 --> 01:06:28,523
Hit it !

773
01:06:39,686 --> 01:06:41,786
Hit it, fucking hit it, Albert !

774
01:06:42,053 --> 01:06:43,653
Hit that motherfucker !

775
01:06:45,054 --> 01:06:48,354
- I can't.
- Dad, just do it !

776
01:06:48,621 --> 01:06:50,421
I can't hold it much longer.

777
01:06:50,833 --> 01:06:53,633
I can't hurt you, sweetheart.
I can't.

778
01:07:02,584 --> 01:07:05,684
No !
Bad Mommy !

779
01:07:06,059 --> 01:07:08,359
You need to be punished !

780
01:07:15,732 --> 01:07:17,032
Aah !
God !

781
01:07:32,317 --> 01:07:34,417
Dad, I'm sorry.

782
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:36,717
I'm so sorry.

783
01:07:37,952 --> 01:07:40,752
Is okay... It's okay, honey.

784
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:46,057
My adrenaline is
so high I can hardly... feel.

785
01:07:49,507 --> 01:07:50,707
Oh my God.

786
01:07:52,394 --> 01:07:55,494
Dad... it stopped.

787
01:07:57,157 --> 01:07:59,457
We've gotta do something fast.

788
01:08:00,515 --> 01:08:01,615
A sedative.

789
01:08:03,886 --> 01:08:06,186
Bring me a sedative,
I'm gonna operate it.

790
01:08:07,242 --> 01:08:08,842
Is there an issue, Father ?

791
01:08:08,935 --> 01:08:10,635
Shit hit the fan, your Eminence.

792
01:08:10,636 --> 01:08:13,136
Our host is fighting back, and winning.

793
01:08:13,379 --> 01:08:15,479
That cannot be allowed to happen.

794
01:08:19,913 --> 01:08:22,813
Sir, I know it's not my place to say this,

795
01:08:23,876 --> 01:08:25,476
but there's another innocent
about to be killed.

796
01:08:25,911 --> 01:08:27,811
- Can't we just--
- You're my main field operative, Father Anthony.

797
01:08:23,876 --> 01:08:25,476
Follow your protocol.

798
01:08:25,911 --> 01:08:27,811
I've lost my audio feed.

799
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:29,912
So I'm gonna have to expose
myself and go in.

800
01:08:39,722 --> 01:08:42,022
Just keep drink... drinking.

801
01:08:42,293 --> 01:08:45,493
But I... I'm trying.
I'm trying.

802
01:08:46,174 --> 01:08:49,974
Oh my God !
Oh my God, I killed Jen !

803
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:52,876
Oh my God !
And Lars !

804
01:08:53,525 --> 01:08:56,325
And that trucker !
I'm a murderer !

805
01:08:56,795 --> 01:08:59,795
- I'm a murderer !
- No, you're not.

806
01:09:00,498 --> 01:09:03,298
If anyone was killed,
they were killed by that...

807
01:09:03,913 --> 01:09:06,713
... thing.
Not you !

808
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:13,150
Now get undressed
and get under the sheets.

809
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,799
It's amazing.

810
01:09:35,195 --> 01:09:39,295
I mean, it seems perfectly
normal now... now.

811
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:56,716
Mary, sweetheart,

812
01:09:58,173 --> 01:10:00,673
I'll have to do something barbaric here.

813
01:10:01,949 --> 01:10:04,349
So I want you to be... perfectly still,

814
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:08,250
so I... won't hurt you too much.

815
01:10:19,929 --> 01:10:21,129
Dad !

816
01:10:21,447 --> 01:10:24,747
Make it go away !
Make it go away !

817
01:10:24,771 --> 01:10:27,571
Shut up, you drunken cow !

818
01:10:28,395 --> 01:10:33,195
Mary... just be still, please !
Be... still !

819
01:10:36,723 --> 01:10:39,423
Pulp the sow, Grandpa,

820
01:10:39,524 --> 01:10:42,324
and make her bleed like a pig !

821
01:10:42,873 --> 01:10:45,973
Go on, stick her, stick it in her--

822
01:10:46,704 --> 01:10:50,704
Don't... Don't listen
to it, just do it ! Just do it !

823
01:10:50,730 --> 01:10:54,730
Yes ! Do it !
And watch your daughter die,

824
01:10:54,731 --> 01:10:58,131
just like you wife did, you fucking hag !

825
01:11:07,631 --> 01:11:10,031
Just do it.
Just do it !

826
01:11:17,226 --> 01:11:20,826
Open her pussy, Grandpa !

827
01:11:29,674 --> 01:11:33,374
- I can't do it.
- Just do it.

828
01:11:34,712 --> 01:11:36,912
God ! Help us !

829
01:12:52,344 --> 01:12:54,444
Oh God ! What are you doing ?

830
01:12:57,607 --> 01:12:58,607
- Get a...    - No !
- Get a towel and clean the blood...

831
01:12:58,608 --> 01:13:01,808
- while I'm doing this.
- You can't do this !

832
01:13:02,417 --> 01:13:03,717
You can't do it !

833
01:13:03,718 --> 01:13:07,118
I'm trying to save
your sister from a... monster,

834
01:13:07,119 --> 01:13:09,319
- and you should be helping me to do it.
- Oh no !

835
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:12,120
Now shut up and hold that !
Hold it !

836
01:13:12,912 --> 01:13:15,512
It's almost over. It's almost...

837
01:13:15,513 --> 01:13:17,413
It's almost... over.

838
01:13:33,484 --> 01:13:37,484
It's almost over, sweetheart,
almost over.

839
01:14:11,727 --> 01:14:14,127
- No !
- Daddy !

840
01:14:14,128 --> 01:14:15,528
Sorry, Albert.

841
01:14:17,531 --> 01:14:20,531
No ! Leave him alone !

842
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:42,630
I told you I wouldn't let you
kill this baby, father.

843
01:14:42,631 --> 01:14:45,631
It must be born
so Asmodeus can live again !

844
01:14:46,061 --> 01:14:47,161
Yeah !

845
01:14:50,093 --> 01:14:56,093
<i>... gone to remain till baby's born...</i>

846
01:14:56,186 --> 01:14:59,386
<i>While a year has come and gone,</i>

847
01:14:59,442 --> 01:15:03,342
<i>since evil last tried to spawn.</i>

848
01:15:03,927 --> 01:15:07,669
<i>Come down, come down, come down below.</i>

849
01:15:10,112 --> 01:15:11,112
<i>The son of tradition waits to grow...</i>

850
01:15:22,801 --> 01:15:24,001
Mary-Elizabeth...

851
01:15:24,739 --> 01:15:26,739
Shht ! Quiet !

852
01:15:27,756 --> 01:15:29,356
Please don't talk, Father.

853
01:15:30,134 --> 01:15:31,534
You wake the baby.

854
01:15:36,773 --> 01:15:38,173
Father,

855
01:15:38,901 --> 01:15:41,001
you're awake. Welcome back.

856
01:15:41,362 --> 01:15:43,162
You've been in a coma for a month.

857
01:15:53,695 --> 01:15:55,695
What... are you ?

858
01:16:00,135 --> 01:16:02,135
Asmodeus the demon.

859
01:16:04,822 --> 01:16:06,322
I used to be their brother.

860
01:16:12,699 --> 01:16:15,099
Don't get all pissed, now.

861
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,900
I've calmed smarter guys than you.

862
01:16:19,302 --> 01:16:20,802
Or how the Cardinal'd say :

863
01:16:21,306 --> 01:16:23,006
Don't be stressed, Father,

864
01:16:23,007 --> 01:16:25,507
I have withered brighter
men than yourself.

865
01:16:26,724 --> 01:16:28,324
But why ?

866
01:16:29,192 --> 01:16:32,392
Why did you have to use me ?
You didn't need a priest.

867
01:16:32,875 --> 01:16:35,675
I'm the Torturer of the
13th level of Hell.

868
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:37,860
I fuck with people !

869
01:16:39,588 --> 01:16:40,988
It's what I do.

870
01:16:50,968 --> 01:16:53,868
You seem damn
comfortable in your custom.

871
01:16:54,752 --> 01:16:56,252
I enjoy the irony.

872
01:17:06,854 --> 01:17:08,554
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

873
01:17:09,285 --> 01:17:11,885
We all know how good in killing
you are, Father.

874
01:17:14,632 --> 01:17:17,532
There's another reason you're
chosen as the sixth sacrifice.

875
01:17:18,224 --> 01:17:21,124
We need a murderer to complete
the birthing cabinet.

876
01:17:25,099 --> 01:17:29,099
Nah, don't worry,
we still need you alive.

877
01:17:31,961 --> 01:17:33,261
For a while.

878
01:17:35,839 --> 01:17:37,939
Make sure you feed Mary tonight.

879
01:17:47,699 --> 01:17:49,799
You heard Asmodeus.

880
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:52,700
Now go'n be ready to
give your sister a meal.

881
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:54,201
Why can't you do it ?

882
01:17:54,202 --> 01:17:56,202
Because I fucking say so !

883
01:17:56,502 --> 01:17:57,802
You got a problem with that ?

884
01:17:57,933 --> 01:18:00,333
My brother runs this place.

885
01:18:00,538 --> 01:18:05,738
I don't take orders from a...
tiny, pasty individual like you.

886
01:18:08,324 --> 01:18:09,924
Bitch.

887
01:18:24,494 --> 01:18:26,394
I read your book.

888
01:18:27,771 --> 01:18:31,071
You say some really
nice things about me.

889
01:18:33,255 --> 01:18:35,155
You should feel lucky.

890
01:18:35,781 --> 01:18:38,381
It's a great honor to be the host.

891
01:18:39,349 --> 01:18:42,649
That's why your sister's jealous,
you know that, right ?

892
01:18:43,368 --> 01:18:46,668
That day she tried to drown
you the in the tub,

893
01:18:47,118 --> 01:18:49,218
she knew you were the chosen one.

894
01:18:50,050 --> 01:18:53,550
Because she's been
a virgin all her life.

895
01:18:53,954 --> 01:18:55,654
But he didn't pick her.

896
01:18:57,058 --> 01:18:58,558
He picked you.

897
01:19:00,392 --> 01:19:02,392
So she took it out on you.

898
01:19:05,155 --> 01:19:07,455
Sisters...hmm.

899
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:12,611
You want me to write
in your book for you ?

900
01:19:19,647 --> 01:19:24,447
<i>Fifth month.
September 1st.</i>

901
01:19:24,898 --> 01:19:30,498
<i>Mary-Elizabeth is getting
as big as this freaking house.</i>

902
01:19:31,458 --> 01:19:37,158
<i>Tonight I take her hunting
for a fifth sacrifice,</i>

903
01:19:37,363 --> 01:19:40,263
<i>and I have a special plan for her.</i>

904
01:19:41,237 --> 01:19:45,237
<i>Everything has been going real good
since we took over the house.</i>

905
01:19:46,117 --> 01:19:50,817
<i>But you can still feel a little tension
between Mary and her sister.</i>

906
01:19:51,338 --> 01:19:55,338
<i>And if there is one thing you don't
want around a pregnant woman,</i>

907
01:19:55,743 --> 01:19:57,110
<i>it's tension...</i>

908
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,040
<i>Especially from a jealous sister.</i>

909
01:20:01,142 --> 01:20:03,942
<i>So like the big man upstairs says :</i>

910
01:20:04,193 --> 01:20:09,993
<i>"If thy right eye offend thee,
pluck it out and cast if from thee."</i>

911
01:20:10,677 --> 01:20:12,077
Amen, brother.

912
01:20:42,287 --> 01:20:44,087
Hello, sister.

913
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:49,172
You're shivering.

914
01:20:51,625 --> 01:20:53,825
No that's okay, I'm getting out.

915
01:21:00,255 --> 01:21:01,455
Elizabeth...

916
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:05,467
Please, Mary-Elizabeth...

917
01:21:05,368 --> 01:21:11,068
"Oh, Mary-Elizabeth, please, no."

918
01:21:13,293 --> 01:21:15,893
I took care of you, don't you remember ?

919
01:21:15,894 --> 01:21:17,994
I... I looked after you.

920
01:21:22,327 --> 01:21:24,327
That's true, Catherine.

921
01:21:25,031 --> 01:21:28,031
- But do you love me ?
- Yes, of course I do.

922
01:21:28,227 --> 01:21:31,427
I love you. I'd do anything
for you but it's... it's...

923
01:21:31,555 --> 01:21:37,055
- Would you do anything for me ?
- Yes, anything. Just command it.

924
01:21:37,418 --> 01:21:41,118
All right, I command you to be my doll.

925
01:21:41,265 --> 01:21:45,465
I'm gonna be a baby soon,
and babies love dollies.

926
01:21:45,445 --> 01:21:49,945
Be my dolly !
Clean the dolly, Mommy !

927
01:21:50,679 --> 01:21:53,179
Rub the dolly, Mommy !

928
01:21:53,352 --> 01:21:54,552
Rub !

929
01:21:55,505 --> 01:22:01,005
Leave me ! Leave me, please ! Leave me !

930
01:22:01,593 --> 01:22:05,593
Scrub it up !
Clean the dolly in the tub !

931
01:22:16,973 --> 01:22:19,973
Need to clean the dolly thoroughly.

932
01:22:38,102 --> 01:22:41,202
Number five.
The sister.

933
01:23:26,573 --> 01:23:30,573
"...first pitch and back into sandpit..."

934
01:23:32,190 --> 01:23:36,090
"November 1st, the Day of the Dead,
is right around the corner.

935
01:23:36,091 --> 01:23:39,191
"The Vatican knows the date
and wants you to know it..."

936
01:23:44,248 --> 01:23:48,725
Crap ! On all the fucking channels,
nothing but crap !

937
01:23:49,105 --> 01:23:51,955
I'm bored.
Talk to me.

938
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:57,163
Why not let me talk to Mary-Elizabeth ?

939
01:23:58,324 --> 01:23:59,924
What do I get out of it ?

940
01:24:03,308 --> 01:24:05,708
We both know I can't beat you, right ?

941
01:24:07,024 --> 01:24:08,224
But I can try.

942
01:24:11,919 --> 01:24:14,419
Worth a try, it should be entertaining.

943
01:24:17,779 --> 01:24:20,079
Crushing your spirit.

944
01:24:22,805 --> 01:24:26,205
It's better than wild trash on talk TV.

945
01:24:26,779 --> 01:24:30,279
All right. You get sixty seconds.

946
01:24:30,717 --> 01:24:31,717
Go !

947
01:24:33,186 --> 01:24:35,186
What about your white monkey ?

948
01:24:35,435 --> 01:24:37,635
What's to prevent him from zapping me

949
01:24:37,636 --> 01:24:39,436
before my time is up ?

950
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:44,500
Sonofabitch !

951
01:24:45,557 --> 01:24:47,457
Fine !

952
01:24:49,093 --> 01:24:53,693
Sixty seconds... uninterrupted.

953
01:24:54,131 --> 01:24:58,831
And as a bonus,
Ivan and I will not listen.

954
01:25:16,703 --> 01:25:18,403
What could I've done to you ?

955
01:25:20,061 --> 01:25:22,761
It's important that
you listen to me, Mary.

956
01:25:23,016 --> 01:25:24,316
Really listen.

957
01:25:28,751 --> 01:25:31,651
I'm not leaving this house, I know that.

958
01:25:32,924 --> 01:25:35,224
But you... still have a chance.

959
01:25:36,304 --> 01:25:38,604
- Don't say that.
- Just listen.

960
01:25:40,562 --> 01:25:42,362
Everything you've done,

961
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:45,520
and will do to me,

962
01:25:46,197 --> 01:25:47,197
is not

963
01:25:47,198 --> 01:25:48,498
your fault.

964
01:25:49,602 --> 01:25:53,102
You have not killed anyone.

965
01:25:54,808 --> 01:25:58,408
If you survive this ordeal,

966
01:25:59,702 --> 01:26:01,702
you'll have to accept that fact,

967
01:26:01,704 --> 01:26:03,604
and forgive yourself.

968
01:26:04,455 --> 01:26:06,455
Or the guilt will destroy you.

969
01:26:07,851 --> 01:26:13,351
Your brother and that creature
inside of you will have won.

970
01:26:14,714 --> 01:26:18,614
- But I killed my family. I was weak.
- No !

971
01:26:22,163 --> 01:26:26,163
You're the only chance your
family has to survive this,

972
01:26:27,032 --> 01:26:29,232
and continue in through you.

973
01:26:29,192 --> 01:26:33,092
Do you understand ?
Do you understand me ?

974
01:26:34,238 --> 01:26:39,038
You carry your family with you,
Mary-Elizabeth,

975
01:26:39,039 --> 01:26:41,139
but you have to survive.

976
01:26:41,778 --> 01:26:44,478
And then forgive yourself for surviving.

977
01:26:50,672 --> 01:26:52,172
Good. Good.

978
01:26:54,485 --> 01:26:58,485
I just pray to God
that you remember this.

979
01:26:58,735 --> 01:27:00,135
I will.

980
01:27:10,133 --> 01:27:13,333
How disappointing !

981
01:27:15,109 --> 01:27:20,309
I knew you had a fucking Jesus
complex, but this, boy...

982
01:27:21,717 --> 01:27:23,817
Very disappointing.

983
01:27:25,034 --> 01:27:29,734
You gave my mother a glimmer of hope.

984
01:27:33,232 --> 01:27:38,932
And now let me tell you what
you're going to give me, Anthony.

985
01:27:40,229 --> 01:27:44,129
Tomorrow is my birthday.

986
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:48,640
And you're going to give me your heart,

987
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:51,470
and your blood,

988
01:27:51,730 --> 01:27:54,130
and your head.

989
01:27:56,817 --> 01:28:00,517
And give me the gift of life.

990
01:28:05,039 --> 01:28:08,539
Now here's something to take your
mind off that horrible thought.

991
01:28:20,165 --> 01:28:22,165
Don't let him bleed to death.

992
01:29:15,033 --> 01:29:17,633
Our Father...

993
01:29:17,943 --> 01:29:20,543
Who is in Heaven...

994
01:29:21,309 --> 01:29:24,309
Hallowed be Thy name...

995
01:29:24,535 --> 01:29:27,735
Hallowed be Thy name...

996
01:29:35,849 --> 01:29:37,449
If you'd like to...

997
01:29:37,605 --> 01:29:39,205
make a confession...

998
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:42,380
I'm willing to listen.

999
01:29:42,386 --> 01:29:43,386
What ?

1000
01:29:45,508 --> 01:29:49,508
You do know that homosexuality is a sin.

1001
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:51,920
You calling me a fag ?

1002
01:29:53,009 --> 01:29:55,109
That's a well-known fact that

1003
01:29:55,105 --> 01:29:59,705
99% of albinos are born with the same gene

1004
01:29:59,706 --> 01:30:02,406
known to cause homosexuality.

1005
01:30:02,737 --> 01:30:04,737
That's not funny, Father.

1006
01:30:08,077 --> 01:30:11,577
How many times have you touched
my penis with your stunt-gun ?

1007
01:30:12,755 --> 01:30:14,455
I ain't no fag.

1008
01:30:15,309 --> 01:30:18,709
But you keep playing with my cock.

1009
01:30:18,961 --> 01:30:22,161
I ain't no fag !
You hear, I ain't no fag !

1010
01:30:22,666 --> 01:30:25,466
I ain't no fag ! Damn priest !
Hear me ?

1011
01:30:29,279 --> 01:30:31,179
The priest is ready.

1012
01:30:32,350 --> 01:30:35,150
I can smell his fear,

1013
01:30:38,472 --> 01:30:41,372
and... anger ?

1014
01:30:44,332 --> 01:30:45,532
Ivan ?

1015
01:30:46,266 --> 01:30:47,766
Ivan !

1016
01:30:48,014 --> 01:30:50,614
Stop him !
Stop him !

1017
01:30:51,411 --> 01:30:53,611
You hear me ? I'm no fucking faggot !

1018
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:56,100
What are you doing ?!

1019
01:30:58,402 --> 01:31:00,102
Fucking albino !

1020
01:31:06,872 --> 01:31:10,972
You just lost... the war.

1021
01:31:21,766 --> 01:31:24,866
The murderer has to die by your hand
or the contract is not finished.

1022
01:31:24,867 --> 01:31:27,267
You have to take the life
that captured the soul.

1023
01:31:28,559 --> 01:31:31,859
Nooooooo !

1024
01:31:32,326 --> 01:31:37,626
Fucking... damned... traitor... vile...
despicable... motherfucker !

1025
01:31:38,067 --> 01:31:40,067
You would have been perfect,

1026
01:31:40,068 --> 01:31:44,168
but you had to redeem
yourself by dying !

1027
01:31:44,815 --> 01:31:47,515
Don't smile like this at me !

1028
01:31:58,125 --> 01:32:01,825
Stupid priest, you think you won ?

1029
01:32:02,151 --> 01:32:03,651
Got rid of the murderer ?

1030
01:32:03,988 --> 01:32:07,588
But I still have one more move.

1031
01:32:08,007 --> 01:32:11,007
You just helped create
your own replacement.

1032
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:15,860
Ivan... is now a member
of your exclusive club...

1033
01:32:16,394 --> 01:32:18,094
- of murderers !
- No !

1034
01:32:18,614 --> 01:32:22,014
- No, no, no !
- Yes, motherfucker !

1035
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:22,900
No !

1036
01:33:19,173 --> 01:33:23,673
Daddy ! I'm coming !

1037
01:33:34,412 --> 01:33:35,612
Let's begin.

1038
01:34:09,502 --> 01:34:12,202
You selfish bitch, fight him !

1039
01:34:14,572 --> 01:34:18,372
Fight, Mary.
Fight the demon's child.

1040
01:34:25,831 --> 01:34:29,531
Don't do it, Mary. Get out of the house.
Get out of the house !

1041
01:34:29,359 --> 01:34:35,059
Please don't do that... sweetheart !
Get out !

1042
01:34:41,672 --> 01:34:45,072
That baby is mine !

1043
01:34:48,667 --> 01:34:50,867
I love you, Mary-Elizabeth.

1044
01:34:51,690 --> 01:34:52,990
Mom ?

1045
01:34:54,174 --> 01:34:55,574
I love you.

1046
01:34:56,909 --> 01:35:03,209
Be gone, be gone, the son of Asmodeus
is about to be born, bitch.

1047
01:35:13,129 --> 01:35:15,829
We grow weak... I'm ready.

1048
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:17,430
I'm ready to be born !

1049
01:35:18,067 --> 01:35:19,567
Helpers !

1050
01:35:19,653 --> 01:35:20,853
Hold her up.

1051
01:35:45,906 --> 01:35:49,806
Filthy ! Unclean ! Foul !

1052
01:35:52,889 --> 01:35:57,189
My son will be born, you can't do anything.

1053
01:36:03,752 --> 01:36:07,252
Push !
Push now !

1054
01:36:44,366 --> 01:36:46,166
Push, bitch !

1055
01:36:47,966 --> 01:36:50,166
Come on !

1056
01:36:57,541 --> 01:36:59,963
Do it now, push !

1057
01:37:10,549 --> 01:37:12,549
That's it, little sister.

1058
01:37:12,776 --> 01:37:15,376
Come on, push !

1059
01:37:51,639 --> 01:37:53,439
He's perfect.

1060
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:55,140
Let me hold him.

1061
01:38:27,855 --> 01:38:29,455
Dr Sammael ?

1062
01:38:31,330 --> 01:38:33,330
I am the Venom of God.

1063
01:38:36,143 --> 01:38:38,343
Lucifer is the one true Satan.

1064
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:41,100
Demons are so stupid.

1065
01:38:45,664 --> 01:38:49,664
I have many names.
I play many roles.

1066
01:38:51,194 --> 01:38:53,394
Before Lucifer, I was Sammael.

1067
01:38:54,008 --> 01:38:58,308
Playing the role of the accusor,
the seducer, the destroyer.

1068
01:38:59,586 --> 01:39:02,986
Eventually I became known as Satan.

1069
01:39:05,441 --> 01:39:07,241
Your lord and master.

1070
01:39:16,492 --> 01:39:19,692
Are you ready to go back
to the 13th level of Hell ?

1071
01:39:22,044 --> 01:39:23,444
Rise.

1072
01:39:29,287 --> 01:39:30,887
I did everything you said.

1073
01:39:33,813 --> 01:39:37,313
You wavered. You had doubts.

1074
01:39:37,314 --> 01:39:40,314
You went to a fucking psychiatrist.

1075
01:39:40,535 --> 01:39:42,335
But I still did everything you wanted.

1076
01:39:42,336 --> 01:39:43,736
You have the child.

1077
01:39:45,624 --> 01:39:48,724
My son will serve you here on Earth
and replace me in the pit later.

1078
01:39:49,445 --> 01:39:52,045
Oh, I don't think so.

1079
01:39:55,819 --> 01:39:57,419
You're going back, now.

1080
01:39:58,502 --> 01:39:59,602
You promised.

1081
01:40:01,596 --> 01:40:04,496
You can't break our agreement now.

1082
01:40:04,594 --> 01:40:06,194
We have an agreement.

1083
01:40:06,195 --> 01:40:07,495
You can't...

1084
01:40:10,469 --> 01:40:13,169
We have a fucking agreement !

1085
01:40:14,979 --> 01:40:15,979
Please.

1086
01:40:16,609 --> 01:40:17,609
Please !

1087
01:40:18,718 --> 01:40:19,818
No !

1088
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:26,400
No ! No ! No !

1089
01:40:41,204 --> 01:40:42,404
No !

1090
01:40:43,883 --> 01:40:44,883
No !

1091
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:04,780
Oh, you did a really good job.

1092
01:41:08,254 --> 01:41:10,254
You get to live.

1093
01:41:11,329 --> 01:41:12,729
Flee.

1094
01:41:20,090 --> 01:41:21,190
Ladies,

1095
01:41:21,869 --> 01:41:24,769
I think he's finally find closure.

1096
01:41:32,874 --> 01:41:34,274
Heavenly Father,

1097
01:41:35,667 --> 01:41:38,367
Satan poisoned this young woman's child.

1098
01:41:39,087 --> 01:41:42,187
But you, Lord, gave the baby a free will.

1099
01:41:42,799 --> 01:41:45,899
Please, Lord, hear our prayer.

1100
01:41:48,123 --> 01:41:49,823
Mary-Elizabeth Martino,

1101
01:41:50,423 --> 01:41:53,523
will you dedicate your life
to finding your child,

1102
01:41:53,806 --> 01:41:57,306
and properly raise him following
the teachings of Christ ?

1103
01:41:58,039 --> 01:41:59,039
I will.

1104
01:42:00,702 --> 01:42:02,602
When you find the demon's child,

1105
01:42:02,603 --> 01:42:06,403
do you swear before God
and His son Jesus-Christ,

1106
01:42:06,574 --> 01:42:08,574
to protect the baby from all evil,

1107
01:42:08,575 --> 01:42:13,175
keeping him safe within the support
and the protection of the Holy Church ?

1108
01:42:14,244 --> 01:42:15,344
I will.

1109
01:42:16,325 --> 01:42:19,925
And I also dedicate my aid
in finding your child,

1110
01:42:19,926 --> 01:42:20,826
and I bless you,

1111
01:42:21,345 --> 01:42:22,445
in the name of the Father,

1112
01:42:22,629 --> 01:42:23,629
and the Son,

1113
01:42:23,630 --> 01:42:24,630
and the Holy Spirit.

1114
01:42:26,107 --> 01:42:29,020
Amen.

1115
