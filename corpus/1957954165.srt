1
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:11,560
-That was chaos!

2
00:00:11,562 --> 00:00:15,138
I, I just don't know where to begin.

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,707
A live bird on stage,

4
00:00:18,709 --> 00:00:20,418
real knives,

5
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,747
and fornication?

6
00:00:23,749 --> 00:00:26,790
This is a college play, god damn it!

7
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:30,754
There are rules which you obviously abandoned.

8
00:00:30,756 --> 00:00:33,301
What were you thinking?

9
00:00:33,303 --> 00:00:34,633
-But did you believe it?

10
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:35,504
-Uh-huh.

11
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,851
-There are two types of people at Yale.

12
00:00:54,835 --> 00:00:57,636
The people who come in already crazy,

13
00:00:57,638 --> 00:00:59,833
and the people who are destined to become

14
00:00:59,835 --> 00:01:01,334
crazy from being there.

15
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,160
I heard about the theater theorist

16
00:01:07,162 --> 00:01:09,533
Emile Zola on my first day of class,

17
00:01:09,535 --> 00:01:11,484
and she was pretty right.

18
00:01:11,486 --> 00:01:13,792
We're all products of our environment.

19
00:01:17,317 --> 00:01:20,501
So, I guess it was only a matter of time.

20
00:01:20,506 --> 00:01:22,180
I just never expected a play

21
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:23,717
to drive me to the breaking point.

22
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:30,799
-I saved you a seat.

23
00:01:34,374 --> 00:01:35,353
-Here.

24
00:01:36,356 --> 00:01:38,952
-Welcome to Naturalism in the Theater.

25
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:45,205
I see some familiar faces in the room.

26
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,917
And some new faces, which is exciting.

27
00:01:48,919 --> 00:01:49,718
To start off,

28
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,974
can anyone tell me what the term

29
00:01:50,976 --> 00:01:53,368
"Naturalism" means?

30
00:01:53,378 --> 00:01:54,558
Yes, Maxine?

31
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,896
-Like a very natural style of theater.

32
00:01:57,898 --> 00:02:00,759
-Yes, Maxine. A style of theater that attempts

33
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:04,232
to create the illusion of reality on stage,

34
00:02:04,234 --> 00:02:08,697
in costume, in set. See, nothing here is painted.

35
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,729
The theatricality is minimal,

36
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:13,622
in fact, it's almost non-existent.

37
00:02:13,624 --> 00:02:15,433
But most importantly, Naturalism

38
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:18,021
is seen in the development of character.

39
00:02:18,023 --> 00:02:21,014
The line between actor and character disappears

40
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:23,401
until the actor becomes the character.

41
00:02:23,403 --> 00:02:25,268
-Like method acting?

42
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,855
-Yes, in a way.

43
00:02:26,857 --> 00:02:31,244
Naturalism would be like method acting

44
00:02:31,246 --> 00:02:34,117
if it applied to everything on the stage.

45
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:36,194
Suddenly, we don't see a set.

46
00:02:36,196 --> 00:02:38,086
We're in somebody's kitchen.

47
00:02:38,088 --> 00:02:41,089
There's no artificial light, we see sunlight.

48
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:44,292
The actor disappears and we see real people.

49
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:45,899
It's like magic.

50
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:46,995
The theater becomes...

51
00:02:46,997 --> 00:02:48,832
-Life itself.

52
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:51,625
-Yes. Life itself.

53
00:02:51,627 --> 00:02:52,936
What's your name?

54
00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:54,698
I haven't seen you before.

55
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,694
-Oh, I'm Ella.

56
00:02:56,627 --> 00:02:58,632
-Oh, Ella, pleasure.

57
00:02:58,634 --> 00:03:02,055
As Ella was saying, Naturalism succeeds

58
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,412
when the theater disappears completely

59
00:03:04,414 --> 00:03:07,716
and we're simply watching life itself.

60
00:03:07,718 --> 00:03:10,260
-Hi. My name is Hannah. Um...

61
00:03:10,262 --> 00:03:13,266
To piggyback on your previous point,

62
00:03:13,268 --> 00:03:15,378
August Strindberg said that,

63
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,214
theaters should be a slice of life.

64
00:03:18,216 --> 00:03:20,969
-Yes, August Strindberg.

65
00:03:20,971 --> 00:03:23,200
One of the most famous and controversial

66
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,122
writers of Naturalism.

67
00:03:25,124 --> 00:03:26,590
Oh, which actually reminds me of a piece

68
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,416
of exciting news.

69
00:03:28,418 --> 00:03:30,579
This fall, in order to strengthen the relationship

70
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:32,485
between undergraduate and graduate

71
00:03:32,487 --> 00:03:33,532
drama schools,

72
00:03:33,534 --> 00:03:36,685
a director from the drama school, Rubel Leal,

73
00:03:36,687 --> 00:03:40,138
will be directing a very selective one-night-only

74
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,956
performance of August Strindberg's, "Miss Julie."

75
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,232
Perhaps the most famous naturalistic play of

76
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:46,273
all time.

77
00:03:46,275 --> 00:03:47,823
-Uh...

78
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:51,056
-As you know, a chance to work with the director

79
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:53,371
from the drama school is a very rare and exciting

80
00:03:53,373 --> 00:03:56,770
opportunity. So I hope you will all audition,

81
00:03:56,772 --> 00:04:00,093
or try to be a part of the production in some way.

82
00:04:00,095 --> 00:04:01,970
Auditions will be held in the Branson Center

83
00:04:01,972 --> 00:04:03,366
tomorrow night at 7:00.

84
00:04:04,314 --> 00:04:05,729
-So you're going to audition?

85
00:04:05,731 --> 00:04:07,506
-Yeah, maybe. It sounds really cool.

86
00:04:13,023 --> 00:04:15,153
-Maxine, are you picking me here tonight?

87
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:16,429
-Ugh. I don't know.

88
00:04:16,431 --> 00:04:18,176
I don't know if I want to go tonight.

89
00:04:18,178 --> 00:04:19,097
-Are you kidding me?

90
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:20,934
It's the first wilds of the year.

91
00:04:20,936 --> 00:04:22,160
-Oh. Oh my God.

92
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:24,663
300 drunk freshmen discovering their sexuality.

93
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:25,463
- Okay, you don't

94
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,474
have to do that every time

95
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:27,781
I invite you.

96
00:04:27,783 --> 00:04:30,238
-I need to prep for the audition tomorrow.

97
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,184
-You have time.

98
00:04:31,186 --> 00:04:33,361
-Well, I need to read the play.

99
00:04:33,363 --> 00:04:35,448
-You read it like eight times this summer.

100
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,980
- Well, I need to read it again.

101
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:41,284
-Miss Julie's gone mad tonight, absolutely mad.

102
00:04:41,286 --> 00:04:43,542
-What?  -It's the first line of the play.

103
00:04:44,344 --> 00:04:45,463
Wow. How can you even claim...

104
00:04:45,465 --> 00:04:46,264
-Oh my God.

105
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:47,295
...if you don't know that.

106
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:52,190
Well, anyway, Miss Julie is going absolutely

107
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,294
mad tonight at The Peasant Dance.

108
00:04:54,565 --> 00:04:57,891
- Huh. - I mean, if you want to go method?

109
00:04:57,893 --> 00:04:59,234
-Okay.

110
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:00,809
We'll see.

111
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:02,956
-Bye, love. -Right. -Text me.

112
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:03,982
-Mwah.

113
00:05:06,476 --> 00:05:07,345
-I don't know what's in pages was

114
00:05:07,347 --> 00:05:08,146
enough of notes.

115
00:05:08,148 --> 00:05:09,146
I mean, I really don't know if  I'm prepared.

116
00:05:09,148 --> 00:05:09,947
-No, I got some...

117
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:10,828
-I have to write an essay the next day.

118
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,629
I don't know if...

119
00:05:11,631 --> 00:05:12,965
-Miss Ella.  -What?

120
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:14,162
-The theater becoming life itself.

121
00:05:14,164 --> 00:05:15,333
-Oh, thanks.

122
00:05:15,335 --> 00:05:16,194
-Ella, right?

123
00:05:16,196 --> 00:05:17,651
-Yeah. -Are you first year?

124
00:05:17,653 --> 00:05:20,233
-Yes. This is my roommate, Hannah.

125
00:05:20,235 --> 00:05:22,210
- Oh. - Hey. - I'm Atticus. Nice to meet you.

126
00:05:22,212 --> 00:05:24,848
- Oh, Atticus, like To Kill a Mockingbird.

127
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:28,622
- Yeah, just like. Are you guys wilding tonight?

128
00:05:28,624 --> 00:05:29,863
- Wilding?

129
00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:31,154
- Uhm, it's a the dance club.

130
00:05:31,156 --> 00:05:32,350
Everyone goes on Wednesdays.

131
00:05:32,352 --> 00:05:33,281
But it's like, all depends on you.

132
00:05:33,283 --> 00:05:35,100
- Oh. Who's everyone?

133
00:05:35,696 --> 00:05:38,166
- Like, everyone. You guys should come.

134
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:39,618
- Yeah, sounds fun.

135
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,934
- Yeah, cool.

136
00:05:40,936 --> 00:05:42,686
- It was really nice to meet you.  - You too.

137
00:05:42,688 --> 00:05:44,227
- See you around.  - Bye.

138
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:49,114
- I hate that kind of hyperbole.

139
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,935
Everyone.

140
00:05:58,023 --> 00:05:59,973
- Did you go to a lot of clubs in Burlington?

141
00:05:59,975 --> 00:06:01,745
- Not really.

142
00:06:01,747 --> 00:06:03,041
- Vermont wasn't exactly...

143
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:05,063
- Because I went to clubs all the time

144
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,124
in New York.

145
00:06:06,126 --> 00:06:10,879
And once I got in the early decision my senior year, I was like,

146
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:11,680
crazy.

147
00:07:03,704 --> 00:07:04,688
Come on.

148
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:30,856
Want a drink?

149
00:07:30,858 --> 00:07:31,657
- What?

150
00:07:33,115 --> 00:07:34,575
- Oh. Yeah.

151
00:07:39,031 --> 00:07:41,977
- Two vodka tonic extra lime, please.

152
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:48,268
Two vodka tonic extra lime, please.

153
00:08:11,173 --> 00:08:11,974
Come on.

154
00:08:13,621 --> 00:08:14,920
- I have to pee.

155
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:53,632
- Hi.

156
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:56,384
- Hi, sorry, I'm just gonna...

157
00:08:56,386 --> 00:08:57,686
- Of course.

158
00:09:01,882 --> 00:09:02,766
I like your dress.

159
00:09:04,164 --> 00:09:06,024
I noticed it when you walked in.

160
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:07,556
- Oh, really?

161
00:09:07,558 --> 00:09:08,771
- Yeah.

162
00:09:08,773 --> 00:09:09,572
- Thanks.

163
00:09:11,606 --> 00:09:13,042
- You're so pretty.

164
00:09:19,864 --> 00:09:23,857
- Who said I was flattering you?

165
00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:26,935
Who said, I was flattering you?

166
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:36,775
Mom?

167
00:09:38,368 --> 00:09:41,560
I told you not to call between 5:00 and 11:00.

168
00:09:41,562 --> 00:09:45,734
I have an audition. It's for Strindberg play.

169
00:09:45,736 --> 00:09:47,646
No, it's not a musical.

170
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,794
Well, I don't even know who that is.

171
00:09:50,796 --> 00:09:52,310
Okay, I'm hanging up.

172
00:09:52,312 --> 00:09:53,962
No, I'm hanging up.

173
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:03,687
Who said I was...

174
00:10:03,689 --> 00:10:05,038
- Flattering you?

175
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,765
- Yeah, it was good.

176
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:10,684
But my opinion though, you should try it more

177
00:10:10,686 --> 00:10:11,865
aggressive.

178
00:10:11,867 --> 00:10:16,479
Like, who said I was flattering you?

179
00:10:16,481 --> 00:10:19,002
- Um, yeah, I'll think about it.

180
00:10:19,004 --> 00:10:20,924
- Look, I'm still going to audition, obviously,

181
00:10:20,926 --> 00:10:24,938
but why did they have to choose Miss Julie?

182
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,156
It's such a misogynistic play.

183
00:10:28,158 --> 00:10:30,398
I mean Strindberg literally calls women

184
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,517
a stunted form of human being.

185
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,714
This is fucking Yale for Christ's sake.

186
00:10:35,716 --> 00:10:37,781
We can't just pretend that the last five decades of

187
00:10:37,783 --> 00:10:40,544
American history didn't happen.

188
00:10:40,546 --> 00:10:42,521
Besides if they had to do a Strindberg,

189
00:10:42,523 --> 00:10:44,252
why didn't they do Olaf?

190
00:10:57,793 --> 00:11:00,108
- It's for awhile. -

191
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,485
- It's like, I don't know he's been watching scripts of emotions

192
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:03,604
- Hey.

193
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:04,407
- Hi.

194
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:07,475
- You knew her?

195
00:11:07,477 --> 00:11:08,792
- Not really.

196
00:11:13,704 --> 00:11:18,191
- Well, I am so proud to have such a turnout here tonight.

197
00:11:18,193 --> 00:11:24,212
Thank you. Well, okay. Uh, Miss Julie.

198
00:11:24,214 --> 00:11:27,325
Miss Julie is not a pretty play.

199
00:11:27,327 --> 00:11:32,125
It is ruthless. It is erotic.

200
00:11:32,127 --> 00:11:36,540
We see Miss Julie, the, the lady of the house

201
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:41,940
becoming utterly powerless at the hand of her own desire.

202
00:11:41,942 --> 00:11:45,193
She, she get seduced by her valet.

203
00:11:45,195 --> 00:11:50,223
And after they consummate, she falls below him

204
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:54,913
and realizing the impossibility of their future,

205
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:59,753
she decides her only choice is to take her own life.

206
00:11:59,755 --> 00:12:01,960
But before we dive into the text,

207
00:12:01,962 --> 00:12:04,773
we're going to start with the peasants dance.

208
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:08,892
This dance is of vital importance to the production

209
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:12,230
because Miss Julie was one of the first times where the

210
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:17,188
lower depths of society where put on stage.

211
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:20,191
And it made people watch.

212
00:12:20,193 --> 00:12:25,453
So this dance is like, like the spirit of the people.

213
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:30,539
It is their chance to be heard.

214
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,474
It's their

215
00:12:31,476 --> 00:12:35,729
encroachment on the bourgeoisie.

216
00:12:35,731 --> 00:12:36,915
- I love him.

217
00:12:36,917 --> 00:12:41,194
- Okay. So I'll leave you with our choreographer, Elise.

218
00:12:44,204 --> 00:12:45,160
- Okay, people.

219
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:48,837
So, I'm going to teach the count and then you'll repeat.

220
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,353
If you didn't bring your dance shoes

221
00:12:50,355 --> 00:12:52,516
then just be careful with your toes.

222
00:12:52,518 --> 00:12:53,682
- Told you.

223
00:12:53,684 --> 00:12:57,335
- Okay. So, five, six, seven, eight.

224
00:12:57,337 --> 00:13:03,201
- One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, in, out

225
00:13:03,203 --> 00:13:07,866
three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

226
00:13:07,868 --> 00:13:10,118
Can I see a rotation of this?

227
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:16,034
So, let's do that again.

228
00:13:16,036 --> 00:13:19,528
Going to start with five, six, seven eight.

229
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:24,848
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

230
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:29,908
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

231
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,787
Uh, do we want to rotate again?

232
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:37,951
Gonna start with five, six, seven, eight

233
00:13:37,953 --> 00:13:39,953
one, two, three, four,

234
00:13:39,955 --> 00:13:42,400
five, six, seven, eight.

235
00:13:42,402 --> 00:13:44,204
One, two, three, four,

236
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,197
five, six, seven, eight.

237
00:13:47,372 --> 00:13:49,377
Okay, so we're going to try this with music

238
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:50,624
five, six, seven, eight.

239
00:13:50,626 --> 00:13:53,927
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

240
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:55,576
One, two, three, four,

241
00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:58,071
five, six, seven, eight.

242
00:14:31,825 --> 00:14:33,695
- Hey.  - Hi.

243
00:14:33,697 --> 00:14:35,041
- Do you finally dance?

244
00:14:35,043 --> 00:14:36,860
- Uh, not really.

245
00:14:37,672 --> 00:14:39,267
- It never does.

246
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:40,068
- Ella Anderson?

247
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:40,869
- Here.

248
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:41,670
- We're ready for you.

249
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,881
- Great, see you.

250
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:43,942
- Break a leg.

251
00:14:43,944 --> 00:14:44,743
- Thank you so much.

252
00:14:52,918 --> 00:14:54,640
- I saw you and

253
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:57,887
went home determined to die.

254
00:14:57,893 --> 00:14:58,869
But I wanted to die

255
00:14:58,874 --> 00:15:02,097
in a fine and agreeable way,

256
00:15:03,253 --> 00:15:04,167
without pain.

257
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:07,868
And then, I got the idea

258
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,209
that it was dangerous

259
00:15:09,211 --> 00:15:12,200
to sleep under a lilac bush.

260
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,331
We had one which at that time

261
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,930
was in full bloom.

262
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:19,002
I at last went to sleep and

263
00:15:19,004 --> 00:15:25,198
woke up really very ill but I didn't die

264
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,661
as you can see.

265
00:15:27,663 --> 00:15:31,555
I don't know what I really wanted.

266
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:35,714
There was no earthly possibility of winning you,

267
00:15:35,716 --> 00:15:39,337
but you were proof for me of the utter

268
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:40,526
hopelessness of escaping

269
00:15:40,536 --> 00:15:43,021
from the circle in which I've been born.

270
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:46,970
- Okay. Cringe.

271
00:15:49,054 --> 00:15:50,894
Why did you pick Zhang?

272
00:15:50,896 --> 00:15:54,444
- Oh, I just connected to his monologue a lot.

273
00:15:54,457 --> 00:15:56,570
- Did you prepare any of

274
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,455
Miss Julie's lines?

275
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,256
- Uh-huh.

276
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:00,175
- Yeah? Okay.

277
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:06,253
- Do you think I can't look at any blood?

278
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:08,709
Do you think I'm so weak?

279
00:16:08,713 --> 00:16:12,935
Oh, I'd like to see your blood

280
00:16:12,937 --> 00:16:17,465
and your brains on the chopping block.

281
00:16:17,467 --> 00:16:19,482
I'd like to see your whole sex

282
00:16:19,484 --> 00:16:24,249
swimming in a lake like, like the one there.

283
00:16:24,254 --> 00:16:31,134
- Excellent.

284
00:16:31,136 --> 00:16:33,789
- Oh, hey, Ella. Sorry, um, Ruben wants to know

285
00:16:33,794 --> 00:16:36,014
your availability for tomorrow night. You didn't fill it out

286
00:16:36,016 --> 00:16:38,527
. - Oh, sorry. - That's okay, there's a backside to the form.

287
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:40,789
- Oh, shoot. I'm free all night. - Great. I'll let him know.

288
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:45,859
- Thanks. - Nice job. Uh, next, Maxine Fletcher.

289
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:52,678
- It sounds like it went well.

290
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,859
- Uh, yeah.

291
00:16:56,012 --> 00:16:58,016
- Maxine Fletcher reading for Miss Julie.

292
00:17:02,326 --> 00:17:08,632
Who's to blame for what has happened? My father? My mother?

293
00:17:08,634 --> 00:17:14,740
Myself? Myself. I haven't got a self at all.

294
00:17:14,747 --> 00:17:15,606
I haven't got a

295
00:17:15,608 --> 00:17:17,150
thought I don't get from my father.

296
00:17:17,152 --> 00:17:19,352
I've got a passion I don't get from my mother.

297
00:17:21,316 --> 00:17:23,842
How could it be my own fault?

298
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:25,320
To shove the blame on Jesus

299
00:17:25,331 --> 00:17:27,847
like Christine does, no.

300
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:30,821
I've got too much pride and too much common sense for that.

301
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,653
Who is responsible for the wrong?

302
00:17:34,655 --> 00:17:36,783
What does it matter who is?

303
00:17:36,785 --> 00:17:38,669
I know I've got to put up with the blame

304
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:40,987
and the consequences.

305
00:17:40,989 --> 00:17:42,387
- Uh, okay. It was good.

306
00:17:42,391 --> 00:17:46,924
Um, it was just a little bit stiff.

307
00:17:46,926 --> 00:17:48,651
Yeah, yeah, um.

308
00:17:49,453 --> 00:17:54,837
A little bit too prepared, so it has to feel more spontaneous.

309
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,024
- Oh, spontaneous?

310
00:17:56,026 --> 00:17:57,701
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like she's saying

311
00:17:57,703 --> 00:18:00,764
this things for the first time.

312
00:18:00,766 --> 00:18:01,565
- Oh, yeah.

313
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:03,056
- Forget everything you

314
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,761
prepared before coming here.

315
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:10,640
And again.

316
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:11,582
- Who's to blame for

317
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:13,225
what has happened?

318
00:18:14,028 --> 00:18:15,392
My father?

319
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,907
My mother?

320
00:18:17,911 --> 00:18:20,654
Myself?

321
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,138
Um, s-sorry

322
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,740
I, I know this, um...

323
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,177
Myself?

324
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:33,694
I haven't,

325
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,352
I haven't.

326
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,628
- Got a self at...

327
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:39,287
- I haven't, I haven't got a self at all.

328
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:40,549
I haven't got

329
00:18:40,551 --> 00:18:43,206
a single thought of my own.

330
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:46,826
- Okay. Okay, thank you.

331
00:18:46,837 --> 00:18:47,636
- Should I do it again?

332
00:18:47,638 --> 00:18:48,802
Because she's like, angry at John,

333
00:18:48,804 --> 00:18:50,950
but also begging him to pardon her and...

334
00:18:50,952 --> 00:18:51,916
- No, no, there's no need.

335
00:18:51,918 --> 00:18:54,359
We're all set here. Okay?

336
00:18:54,377 --> 00:18:56,580
- Okay.

337
00:18:56,587 --> 00:18:58,396
Thanks.

338
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,738
- He didn't have me read from Miss Julie,

339
00:19:27,758 --> 00:19:28,959
but I saw it coming.

340
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:32,893
I'm just, I'm way more of a Christine.

341
00:19:32,898 --> 00:19:35,378
Did you read for Miss Julie?

342
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,262
- Yeah, I did.

343
00:19:37,272 --> 00:19:39,229
- Well, you're a Julie.

344
00:19:40,606 --> 00:19:41,835
- Well, I don't know.

345
00:19:41,837 --> 00:19:43,333
I just read when he asked me to.

346
00:19:43,361 --> 00:19:44,553
- Oh my God. No, no, no, it's,

347
00:19:44,555 --> 00:19:48,722
it's so nice that like we're different types.

348
00:19:48,724 --> 00:19:51,444
I mean, I just know

349
00:19:51,446 --> 00:19:57,065
that I'm a Christine. I just know it.

350
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:05,674
- It's like, why am I always

351
00:20:05,676 --> 00:20:07,683
stuck handing out flyers to freshmen?

352
00:20:07,688 --> 00:20:08,647
Like if they haven't found

353
00:20:08,649 --> 00:20:09,953
Model UN by September,

354
00:20:09,955 --> 00:20:11,124
do we even want them?

355
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,494
Hello.

356
00:20:16,496 --> 00:20:17,841
- What?

357
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:19,134
Maxine?

358
00:20:19,145 --> 00:20:21,337
- Sorry.

359
00:20:21,341 --> 00:20:23,091
I'm so stressed out.

360
00:20:23,093 --> 00:20:23,892
I'm not gonna lose

361
00:20:23,894 --> 00:20:25,153
this part two to a fucking freshman

362
00:20:25,155 --> 00:20:26,937
from Bill Mart.

363
00:20:26,943 --> 00:20:28,122
- Who?

364
00:20:28,124 --> 00:20:29,482
-Ella Anderson.

365
00:20:29,484 --> 00:20:30,445
- I don't know her.

366
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:36,419
- This is gonna sound crazy.

367
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:38,036
I had a dream last night,

368
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:39,863
that I pushed her down the stairs.

369
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:41,615
- Okay.

370
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:42,415
- Yeah, I was just

371
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:43,534
standing there watching her falling

372
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:46,327
this long flight of stairs.

373
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:48,113
Then, I woke up and I was like,

374
00:20:48,127 --> 00:20:50,002
"What is wrong with me?

375
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:55,717
- No, that's totally, no, totally normal.

376
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:57,926
- I just feel like this is my part, you know.

377
00:20:57,928 --> 00:20:59,693
Like all summer,

378
00:20:59,695 --> 00:21:00,861
I just had this gut feeling,

379
00:21:00,864 --> 00:21:02,273
I was finally going to get something

380
00:21:02,275 --> 00:21:03,554
big in the fall.

381
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,714
- You've gotten big stuff

382
00:21:04,716 --> 00:21:06,062
in the past, Max.

383
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:07,070
- Yeah, I fucking clawed

384
00:21:07,072 --> 00:21:09,359
my way out of the ensemble.

385
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,530
Miss Julie's part

386
00:21:10,532 --> 00:21:11,742
for a really good actress.

387
00:21:11,748 --> 00:21:13,269
Like, this is my chance

388
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:15,970
to finally be taken seriously.

389
00:21:15,972 --> 00:21:18,933
- Miss Julie's kind of a bitch.

390
00:21:18,935 --> 00:21:21,565
- No, she's not a bitch.

391
00:21:21,567 --> 00:21:23,481
She goes for what she wants.

392
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:26,189
There's a difference.

393
00:21:28,323 --> 00:21:31,745
- So, welcome to callback!

394
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,578
So, uh, my team and I,

395
00:21:37,593 --> 00:21:38,712
we were really impressed

396
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,405
with all of your auditions.

397
00:21:40,415 --> 00:21:44,880
You brought energy, which is great.

398
00:21:44,882 --> 00:21:47,162
Not everyone has that.

399
00:21:48,513 --> 00:21:49,979
So for our scene,

400
00:21:49,981 --> 00:21:50,992
what we're going to do

401
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:52,511
is the scene where

402
00:21:52,514 --> 00:21:54,194
Miss Julie enters the kitchen

403
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:56,422
for the first time and there

404
00:21:56,424 --> 00:22:00,445
the servants are, John and Christine

405
00:22:00,449 --> 00:22:02,825
the real thing.

406
00:22:03,628 --> 00:22:04,426
Let's go!

407
00:22:06,131 --> 00:22:07,435
- Okay. Is it ready?

408
00:22:07,437 --> 00:22:08,767
- You ladies wanna talk secrets?

409
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:10,300
- Isn't he inquisitive.

410
00:22:10,311 --> 00:22:12,196
- Oh, what a nice smell of violet.

411
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:14,733
- Impudent person is the fellow

412
00:22:14,735 --> 00:22:16,491
that an expert in perfumes.

413
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,134
- Have you ladies then been brewing

414
00:22:18,138 --> 00:22:20,080
a magic potion this midsummer night?

415
00:22:20,091 --> 00:22:20,890
Something so is to

416
00:22:20,892 --> 00:22:22,152
be able to read one's fortune,

417
00:22:22,173 --> 00:22:22,972
so that you might get a

418
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:23,773
sight of the future.

419
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,809
- Yes, if he manages to see that,

420
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,252
he must have very good eyes.

421
00:22:27,258 --> 00:22:28,337
- Pour it in the bottle

422
00:22:28,339 --> 00:22:30,106
and walk it to Charlie.

423
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,436
Let the man come now

424
00:22:31,448 --> 00:22:33,546
and dance this the.

425
00:22:33,566 --> 00:22:34,510
- I don't want me just obliged

426
00:22:34,523 --> 00:22:35,321
you to anyone

427
00:22:35,323 --> 00:22:36,857
but I promised to Christine's...

428
00:22:36,863 --> 00:22:38,029
- Oh, well, but you can

429
00:22:38,038 --> 00:22:39,855
get somebody else.

430
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,910
What do you say, Christine?

431
00:22:40,912 --> 00:22:43,342
Won't you lend me John?

432
00:22:44,474 --> 00:22:45,504
I haven't got

433
00:22:45,506 --> 00:22:46,747
any say in the matter.

434
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:51,504
- With you, Miss Julie?

435
00:22:51,506 --> 00:22:52,304
- If you mean it.

436
00:22:52,306 --> 00:22:54,893
- It's impossible. Absolutely impossible.

437
00:22:54,895 --> 00:22:56,725
- I don't understand what you mean.

438
00:22:56,727 --> 00:22:57,676
- Can it be possible

439
00:22:57,678 --> 00:22:58,999
that you imagine such a thing

440
00:22:59,008 --> 00:23:00,625
for a single minute?

441
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,714
- Me, no, but the people, yes.

442
00:23:04,739 --> 00:23:08,451
- What, that I should be in love with a servant?

443
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:09,262
- I'm not by any means

444
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:10,063
an educated man,

445
00:23:10,065 --> 00:23:11,109
but there had been cases.

446
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:13,096
And nothing is sacred to the people.

447
00:23:13,098 --> 00:23:16,099
- I do believe the man is an aristocrat.

448
00:23:16,101 --> 00:23:17,593
- Yes, that I am.

449
00:23:17,607 --> 00:23:19,176
- And I'm on the down path.

450
00:23:19,178 --> 00:23:21,384
- Don't go down, Miss Julie.

451
00:23:21,386 --> 00:23:22,808
Take my advice, nobody will ever

452
00:23:22,811 --> 00:23:23,940
believe that you went down

453
00:23:23,942 --> 00:23:24,988
of your own free will.

454
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,990
People will always say you fell.

455
00:23:26,992 --> 00:23:28,011
- I have a better opinion

456
00:23:28,013 --> 00:23:29,482
of people than you have.

457
00:23:29,484 --> 00:23:31,354
Come and try, come.

458
00:23:31,356 --> 00:23:32,826
- You're strange,  you know.

459
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:37,012
- Perhaps I am and so are you.

460
00:23:37,017 --> 00:23:38,809
Everything is strange.

461
00:23:38,823 --> 00:23:43,526
Life, people. Everything is scum which

462
00:23:43,528 --> 00:23:48,363
drifts across the water until it sinks.

463
00:23:48,383 --> 00:23:49,182
I have a dream

464
00:23:49,184 --> 00:23:51,855
which comes up now and again.

465
00:23:51,857 --> 00:23:55,153
And now, it haunts me.

466
00:23:55,155 --> 00:23:57,701
I'm sitting on a very high pillar and

467
00:23:57,703 --> 00:24:01,259
I can't see any possibility of getting down.

468
00:24:01,261 --> 00:24:03,542
I feel dizzy when I look down but I have

469
00:24:03,544 --> 00:24:06,224
to get down all the same.

470
00:24:06,226 --> 00:24:09,413
I haven't got the nerve to throw myself off.

471
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:10,859
I can't keep my balance

472
00:24:10,861 --> 00:24:12,465
and I want to fall,

473
00:24:12,467 --> 00:24:13,266
but I don't fall

474
00:24:13,268 --> 00:24:16,306
and I don't get a moment's peace,

475
00:24:16,308 --> 00:24:19,044
until I'm down below.

476
00:24:19,046 --> 00:24:20,804
No rest until I'm down on the ground

477
00:24:20,806 --> 00:24:23,011
and when I'm down on the ground,

478
00:24:23,013 --> 00:24:26,850
I... want to dip myself right into the Earth.

479
00:24:29,273 --> 00:24:32,429
Have you ever felt anything like that?

480
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,201
Maxine, you're still here?

481
00:24:43,203 --> 00:24:45,706
- Oh, my God. It's so embarrassing.

482
00:24:45,714 --> 00:24:49,465
- No. Why, why are you crying?

483
00:24:51,231 --> 00:24:52,029
You probably noticed

484
00:24:52,031 --> 00:24:54,421
I was a little off today.

485
00:24:54,423 --> 00:24:56,388
It's just I really

486
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,541
connected with Miss Julie

487
00:24:57,543 --> 00:25:03,158
because... because...

488
00:25:03,162 --> 00:25:05,695
- We- well, you don't

489
00:25:05,706 --> 00:25:07,457
have to talk about it, okay?

490
00:25:08,523 --> 00:25:10,084
- It's fine, it's just...

491
00:25:13,397 --> 00:25:16,195
My mom's been really ill

492
00:25:16,216 --> 00:25:17,808
lately and it just,

493
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:20,529
the scenes today totally reminded me

494
00:25:20,531 --> 00:25:23,056
of the struggle we've had together,

495
00:25:23,058 --> 00:25:26,409
that she gets progressively worse.

496
00:25:26,411 --> 00:25:32,110
- Do, do they know what's wrong with her?

497
00:25:32,112 --> 00:25:33,987
- It's skin disease.

498
00:25:33,989 --> 00:25:36,439
- Skin disease?

499
00:25:36,441 --> 00:25:38,391
- Uh-huh.

500
00:25:38,393 --> 00:25:40,023
- Oh.

501
00:25:40,025 --> 00:25:41,865
- She can't even put shoes on.

502
00:25:41,867 --> 00:25:43,742
It's too painful.

503
00:25:46,034 --> 00:25:46,833
- Oh no.

504
00:25:47,859 --> 00:25:50,394
It's just she always dreamed that

505
00:25:50,396 --> 00:25:51,546
I'd play Miss Julie,

506
00:25:51,548 --> 00:25:54,272
and now I don't even know

507
00:25:54,274 --> 00:25:57,958
if she'll make it that long.

508
00:25:57,968 --> 00:26:03,507
I just want to make her proud.

509
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:05,774
- Don't worry.

510
00:26:05,776 --> 00:26:06,575
I have a feeling

511
00:26:06,577 --> 00:26:09,177
that you will.

512
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:09,978
Hmm.

513
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:13,645
- Okay, yeah.

514
00:26:51,716 --> 00:26:52,840
- What the fuck?

515
00:27:04,725 --> 00:27:05,994
- Oh, Hannah.

516
00:27:06,797 --> 00:27:07,736
- Hi.

517
00:27:07,738 --> 00:27:08,537
- Um...

518
00:27:13,422 --> 00:27:16,135
Okay. I'm not gonna lie.

519
00:27:16,137 --> 00:27:17,742
Initially, I was very upset

520
00:27:17,744 --> 00:27:20,093
that I wasn't cast as Christine,

521
00:27:20,095 --> 00:27:21,600
I really thought I nailed it.

522
00:27:21,602 --> 00:27:23,378
However, I took it as a blessing

523
00:27:23,384 --> 00:27:25,044
in disguise because

524
00:27:25,046 --> 00:27:26,169
I realize now that I need

525
00:27:26,171 --> 00:27:28,569
to function as my own agent.

526
00:27:28,574 --> 00:27:31,239
Actors have no power.

527
00:27:31,241 --> 00:27:32,756
I on the other hand have a lot

528
00:27:32,758 --> 00:27:33,718
of things I want to say.

529
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,964
And so, I would really love to

530
00:27:34,966 --> 00:27:35,881
be the assistant director

531
00:27:35,883 --> 00:27:37,262
of this production.

532
00:27:37,264 --> 00:27:38,063
I don't think it would conflict

533
00:27:38,065 --> 00:27:40,458
with my role as featured female dancer

534
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,131
in the peasant dance at all.

535
00:27:43,133 --> 00:27:44,167
- Oh.

536
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:44,968
All right, great so I...

537
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,229
- I mean, why don't we organize.

538
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:47,837
I, I know how to command a room.

539
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:48,973
I have a black belt in karate.

540
00:27:48,975 --> 00:27:49,863
I speak two languages.

541
00:27:49,865 --> 00:27:50,966
And I speak a third language

542
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:51,860
but not as smooth as the other two. I...

543
00:27:51,862 --> 00:27:52,841
-Sounds good. Uh...

544
00:27:52,843 --> 00:27:58,609
I, I could actually use an assistant.

545
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:14,839
- Congratulations, Maxine.

546
00:28:14,841 --> 00:28:15,640
- Oh.

547
00:28:15,642 --> 00:28:16,561
You deserve it.

548
00:28:16,563 --> 00:28:21,987
-Thank you.

549
00:28:21,989 --> 00:28:23,108
- I want the three leads

550
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:25,611
to sit next to each other, okay?

551
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:26,419
- Okay.

552
00:28:26,421 --> 00:28:27,616
[thumping

553
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:35,427
- Okay.

554
00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:38,215
- Okay, everyone, so  let's begin.

555
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,586
As most of you know,

556
00:28:40,603 --> 00:28:43,395
Miss Julie is Strinberg's most

557
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:47,305
ambitious attempt at Naturalism.

558
00:28:47,307 --> 00:28:49,329
He wanted uh, everything

559
00:28:49,334 --> 00:28:52,856
to, to feel real like the audience

560
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:55,661
is there at Christine's kitchen.

561
00:28:56,466 --> 00:28:58,368
So some people thought

562
00:28:58,372 --> 00:29:00,369
his vision was crazy,

563
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:02,851
but I too am expecting

564
00:29:02,853 --> 00:29:03,992
something like that.

565
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:06,783
Like total of uh...  Authenticity?

566
00:29:06,785 --> 00:29:07,584
- Authenticity.

567
00:29:07,586 --> 00:29:11,773
- Oh, yes. So how far will you

568
00:29:11,775 --> 00:29:17,046
go to bring Miss Julie to life?

569
00:29:17,048 --> 00:29:18,079
Let's go.

570
00:29:18,093 --> 00:29:19,407
- The action takes place

571
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:20,223
in the Count's Kitchen

572
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:21,832
on a midsummer night.

573
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:23,473
- Miss Julie is mad again tonight,

574
00:29:23,476 --> 00:29:24,508
absolutely mad.

575
00:29:24,518 --> 00:29:26,032
- Oh, so you are here, are you?

576
00:29:26,034 --> 00:29:27,628
-Now is a finishing touch.

577
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:28,976
You must kiss my shoes.

578
00:29:28,978 --> 00:29:29,777
- This kind of thing

579
00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:31,364
mustn't go any further, Miss.

580
00:29:31,366 --> 00:29:32,165
-  Peasants enter.

581
00:29:32,968 --> 00:29:33,767
- Oh yeah. And then,

582
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:36,434
that's where the dancers enter into the hall.

583
00:29:38,087 --> 00:29:41,321
- Oh, kill me. Kill me too.

584
00:29:41,323 --> 00:29:43,398
If you can kill an innocent

585
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,610
animal without your hand shaking.

586
00:29:44,623 --> 00:29:46,593
-  Look here. I don't care

587
00:29:46,595 --> 00:29:47,796
anything about that because it has

588
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:49,487
nothing to do with me,

589
00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:50,774
but if you think you're going

590
00:29:50,776 --> 00:29:53,271
to convince him to elope with you

591
00:29:53,273 --> 00:29:54,327
and we'll put a very fine

592
00:29:54,329 --> 00:29:56,314
spoke in your little wheel.

593
00:29:56,316 --> 00:29:58,712
- That's true. I am beneath

594
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,449
the very last.

595
00:30:00,451 --> 00:30:01,536
I am the last myself.

596
00:30:01,538 --> 00:30:03,912
- It's awful, but

597
00:30:03,914 --> 00:30:07,060
there's no other way out.

598
00:30:07,062 --> 00:30:08,436
Go.

599
00:30:08,438 --> 00:30:09,998
- End  of play.

600
00:30:15,766 --> 00:30:19,434
- Okay, uh, nice, nice start.

601
00:30:19,449 --> 00:30:23,514
So we have work to do.

602
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,226
But I am excited for, for the journey

603
00:30:26,235 --> 00:30:28,996
we are about to embark on, right?

604
00:30:36,157 --> 00:30:38,157
- Oh my God. You're really so good.

605
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,239
- I'm so excited to work together.

606
00:30:40,241 --> 00:30:41,171
- I feel the same, I think it's

607
00:30:41,185 --> 00:30:42,665
gonna be like, really fun.

608
00:30:44,174 --> 00:30:46,071
- Excuse me ladies,

609
00:30:46,074 --> 00:30:47,874
but we have to be out of the room

610
00:30:47,876 --> 00:30:54,628
by 11:00 or the doors lock, so...

611
00:31:00,656 --> 00:31:01,687
- It's so impressive you're in

612
00:31:01,697 --> 00:31:03,126
this is a freshman.

613
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:04,573
You've no idea how lucky you are to

614
00:31:04,575 --> 00:31:05,761
have a school of drama director.

615
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:07,272
- Yeah, I'm so excited.

616
00:31:07,274 --> 00:31:09,558
He seems awesome.

617
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,231
- Have you studied acting a lot?

618
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:12,636
- No, not really.

619
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:14,780
- You're joking.

620
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:15,962
- No.

621
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:18,526
- Seriously, you're like so good.

622
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,932
- I mean, my sister did.

623
00:31:21,938 --> 00:31:23,497
My school didn't really have the

624
00:31:23,499 --> 00:31:25,841
resources for drama film around.

625
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,591
- Wow, that's so hard.

626
00:31:28,593 --> 00:31:30,948
I mean, you're perfect for the role then.

627
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,002
- What do you mean?

628
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,209
- Well, like Christine

629
00:31:33,211 --> 00:31:35,206
also came from nothing.

630
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:37,085
- Well, I didn't come from nothing.

631
00:31:37,087 --> 00:31:38,126
I just didn't have a lot

632
00:31:38,128 --> 00:31:40,000
of theater opportunities.

633
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:42,521
- Oh, of course, that's what I meant.

634
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:45,966
I'm from LA.

635
00:31:45,975 --> 00:31:47,229
- That's so cool.

636
00:31:47,231 --> 00:31:48,323
- It's the best.

637
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:50,250
You know we should get

638
00:31:50,258 --> 00:31:51,287
to know each other better.

639
00:31:51,289 --> 00:31:52,377
We're like the only two female

640
00:31:52,384 --> 00:31:53,483
leads in this play.

641
00:31:53,485 --> 00:31:55,165
- Oh, only a three-person play.

642
00:31:55,173 --> 00:31:56,543
- What are you doing this weekend?

643
00:31:56,545 --> 00:31:58,176
- Oh, nothing.

644
00:31:58,178 --> 00:32:00,015
- Great. Well, you should come

645
00:32:00,027 --> 00:32:00,826
to my house on Friday,

646
00:32:00,828 --> 00:32:02,307
and we're having a party.

647
00:32:02,317 --> 00:32:04,227
Ask for the drama house.

648
00:32:04,229 --> 00:32:05,415
- Yeah, I'd love to.

649
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:08,231
- Oh, great. Well, see you soon.

650
00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:15,809
- What are you doing tonight?

651
00:32:15,811 --> 00:32:18,787
- Oh, I'm just going to this party that

652
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:20,123
- Oh.

653
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:22,370
- What about you?

654
00:32:22,372 --> 00:32:23,647
- I'm going to global grounds

655
00:32:23,649 --> 00:32:24,447
to play Stratego

656
00:32:24,449 --> 00:32:25,996
with two of my friends from Blue.

657
00:32:26,007 --> 00:32:27,907
- Oh, nice.

658
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:29,139
- There's actually a thriving

659
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:30,903
Stratego Community here.

660
00:32:30,905 --> 00:32:34,441
- Fun.

661
00:32:34,443 --> 00:32:35,244
- Yeah.

662
00:33:01,534 --> 00:33:03,223
- Are you with Colin?

663
00:33:03,225 --> 00:33:05,360
- Um, no.

664
00:33:05,362 --> 00:33:07,219
- Oh.

665
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,154
I just, I just got that vibes from you.

666
00:33:39,086 --> 00:33:39,885
- Hey.

667
00:33:39,887 --> 00:33:41,797
- Oh, my God. You made it.

668
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:44,144
Meet my friends. This is Doris.

669
00:33:44,146 --> 00:33:46,051
- You, you need to talk to me right now.

670
00:33:46,053 --> 00:33:46,852
- Oh, my God.

671
00:33:46,854 --> 00:33:47,753
- You will never guess what happened.

672
00:33:47,755 --> 00:33:49,409
- Wha- wha- what? Oh.

673
00:33:49,411 --> 00:33:51,181
- You guys. Talk to her.

674
00:33:53,336 --> 00:33:55,043
Would you rather be one dog or two?

675
00:33:55,045 --> 00:33:56,114
- Um, two,

676
00:33:56,116 --> 00:33:56,915
- Wrong.

677
00:33:57,718 --> 00:33:59,768
- Ignore him. I'm Reginald.

678
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,585
- Hi, I'm Ella.

679
00:34:04,745 --> 00:34:05,544
- Don't you think her hair

680
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:06,459
would be better like this?

681
00:34:07,736 --> 00:34:10,101
Yeah, it's very Greta Garbo Grand Hotel.

682
00:34:10,103 --> 00:34:10,997

683

- Wait, so how did you, someone...

737
00:36:16,647 --> 00:36:17,921
- Oh, you go first.

738
00:36:17,923 --> 00:36:18,722
- No, no, no, no.

739
00:36:18,724 --> 00:36:21,164
- Oh, um, I was just going to ask

740
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:22,207
how you got into theater?

741
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,826
-Mmm...  - Boring question, I know.

742
00:36:23,828 --> 00:36:26,141
- No, um... Actually, it's a funny story.

743
00:36:26,148 --> 00:36:28,686
Um, so I might say, I played sports

744
00:36:28,689 --> 00:36:29,748
in high school, um,

745
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:30,661
in my first year here,

746
00:36:30,671 --> 00:36:32,626
but I always knew  I wanted to be an actor.

747
00:36:32,628 --> 00:36:33,870
You know, I just never had the balls

748
00:36:33,872 --> 00:36:34,671
to say it.

749
00:36:34,673 --> 00:36:36,672
- No, I feel that, where I'm from,

750
00:36:36,674 --> 00:36:39,489
I feel like it's such a vain thing to say.

751
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:40,944
- What do you mean by that?

752
00:36:40,946 --> 00:36:43,597
- Oh, I don't know. When you say,

753
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,904
I want to be an actor, there is such

754
00:36:45,906 --> 00:36:47,526
a stigma attached.

755
00:36:47,528 --> 00:36:50,404
Like that, you're self-obsessed or vain.

756
00:36:50,406 --> 00:36:51,598
- Hmm...

757
00:36:51,612 --> 00:36:53,649
But in my family, it was never the role

758
00:36:53,659 --> 00:36:55,609
they wanted me to feel.

759
00:36:55,611 --> 00:36:57,631
I came from a family of professors. There all very similar.

760
00:36:57,633 --> 00:37:00,724
- Your never everyone's vain.

761
00:37:00,726 --> 00:37:01,965
- Well.

762
00:37:01,967 --> 00:37:03,398
- No. I mean it's true.

763
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,429
I mean we'll make some

764
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,379
actor more vain than a professor.

765
00:37:06,381 --> 00:37:07,180
I mean actress spend their

766
00:37:07,182 --> 00:37:07,981
lives giving voice

767
00:37:07,983 --> 00:37:09,678
to other people, to other people's story...

768
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,478
- No, no. - ...and experiences and...

769
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,325
- I totally agree but you also

770
00:37:12,327 --> 00:37:14,580
have to believe that you're the person

771
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,850
to do it, that you're worth watching.

772
00:37:16,852 --> 00:37:17,651
- Of course, you have to believe

773
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:18,453
in yourself because otherwise

774
00:37:18,468 --> 00:37:20,939
you're fucked, you'll go crazy.

775
00:37:20,941 --> 00:37:22,425
- No, you're right.

776
00:37:22,427 --> 00:37:23,639
- And someone said I'm wild

777
00:37:23,644 --> 00:37:25,343
but sometimes when I meet people,

778
00:37:25,345 --> 00:37:27,856
I think, wow, like they don't know

779
00:37:27,858 --> 00:37:28,697
that they could be meeting

780
00:37:28,699 --> 00:37:30,714
the next Sean Penn or...

781
00:37:30,716 --> 00:37:32,726
- - Timothée Chalamet.

782
00:37:32,728 --> 00:37:33,527
What?

783
00:37:34,728 --> 00:37:37,951
- You're just so unapologetic about it.

784
00:37:37,953 --> 00:37:39,239
- What is it to apologize for it?

785
00:37:41,206 --> 00:37:42,801
- Nothing, I guess.

786
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,141
- You're fucking great.

787
00:37:46,144 --> 00:37:47,190
- Oh, please.

788
00:37:47,195 --> 00:37:48,361
- It's true.

789
00:37:48,378 --> 00:37:50,378
What is this whole humble act about?

790
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,532
- Very humble act?

791
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:54,486
- Yeah, you just own it.

792
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:55,794
- Oh.

793
00:37:57,102 --> 00:37:59,117
- Do you want to get out of here?

794
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,345
- Um, yeah, you should go.

795
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:03,236
- No.

796
00:38:03,238 --> 00:38:06,655
- No, I do, I want to leave with you.

797
00:38:06,657 --> 00:38:08,215
- Okay.

798
00:38:08,217 --> 00:38:10,077

Hi, hi, good, you're all here.

Happy Saturday.

816
00:39:39,354 --> 00:39:41,585

817
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,070
-What?

818
00:39:43,072 --> 00:39:44,428
- Nothing.

819
00:39:44,437 --> 00:39:48,510
- Turning, as I said. Time of lust.

820
00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:50,348
Time for regret.

- Why?

00:39:53,483 --> 00:39:55,744
- Well, perfect time to start studio work.

823
00:39:55,746 --> 00:39:57,808
Let's go, everyone.

824
00:39:57,816 --> 00:40:03,550
Hi, hi, so at the heart of

825
00:40:03,552 --> 00:40:06,683
the naturalistic acting, there is this...

826
00:40:07,485 --> 00:40:09,843
Okay, see, there's this need for

827
00:40:09,845 --> 00:40:11,927
a metaphysical experience.

828
00:40:11,932 --> 00:40:16,329
You have to, to just connect with

829
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:18,113
your body, and then just make

830
00:40:18,123 --> 00:40:20,819
your body like, like a straw,

831
00:40:20,821 --> 00:40:24,419
that connects the unseen

832
00:40:24,423 --> 00:40:28,025
with the scene and just let the energy flow.

833
00:40:28,027 --> 00:40:29,479
Okay, just let the energy flow.

834
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:31,099
Let's start walking around.

835
00:40:31,101 --> 00:40:37,430
Walking around as your character.

836
00:40:37,432 --> 00:40:42,138
Think about your space,  the universe.

837
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:48,018
Your place in the world.

838
00:40:48,027 --> 00:40:53,365
What do you want?

839
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:57,741
What do you need?

840
00:40:57,743 --> 00:40:59,673
Where's your center of energy?

841
00:40:59,675 --> 00:41:03,108
Is it your brain?

842
00:41:03,113 --> 00:41:05,954
Is it your heart?

843
00:41:05,956 --> 00:41:12,913
Is your crotch?

844
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:15,463
Yes, yes, look to the other

845
00:41:15,465 --> 00:41:17,886
people in this room.

846
00:41:17,888 --> 00:41:20,463
Yes. How did they change you?

847
00:41:20,465 --> 00:41:23,629
Good, interesting, interesting.

848
00:41:24,751 --> 00:41:34,132
Let's just jump in scene one.

849
00:41:34,134 --> 00:41:35,944
- Miss Julie is mad again, tonight.

850
00:41:35,946 --> 00:41:37,410
Absolutely, mad.

851
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:39,192
- Oh, and so you're here, are you?

852
00:41:39,194 --> 00:41:40,804
- I accompany the count to the station,

853
00:41:40,806 --> 00:41:41,920
when we passed a bar on my way back

854
00:41:41,922 --> 00:41:43,446
- Okay, hold, hold,  hold, hold.

855
00:41:43,448 --> 00:41:45,689
So, where was Miss Julie, again?

856
00:41:45,691 --> 00:41:47,145
- Oh, uh, she was

857
00:41:47,147 --> 00:41:47,946
dating with the servants.

858
00:41:47,948 --> 00:41:49,751
- Yes, it was midsummer dance, right?

859
00:41:49,753 --> 00:41:50,552
- Mm-hmm.

860
00:41:50,554 --> 00:41:53,855
She was taking part on that ritual of the

861
00:41:53,857 --> 00:41:56,780
ancient ritual of summer solstice.

862
00:41:56,782 --> 00:41:59,157
It was a pagan ritual,

863
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:06,111
together, Miss Julie, and the pagan ritual.

864
00:42:06,126 --> 00:42:11,590
The lady of the house, the count starter. It's not casual.

865
00:42:12,392 --> 00:42:13,191
Do it again.

866
00:42:16,136 --> 00:42:18,892
- Miss Julie is mad again tonight. Absolutely mad.

867
00:42:18,894 --> 00:42:20,729
- Oh, and so you're here, are you?

868
00:42:20,731 --> 00:42:22,631
I accompanied the count to the station and

869
00:42:22,633 --> 00:42:23,902
when I pass the bar on my way back,

870
00:42:23,904 --> 00:42:25,340
I went in to have a dance.

871
00:42:25,345 --> 00:42:26,454
And at that time,  Miss Julie

872
00:42:26,456 --> 00:42:28,857
was dancing with that man, Forester.

873
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:30,083
And when she noticed me,

874
00:42:30,085 --> 00:42:31,204
she went straight towards me

875
00:42:31,206 --> 00:42:32,806
and asked me to be her partner in the waltz.

876
00:42:32,808 --> 00:42:33,999
And from that moment,

877
00:42:34,003 --> 00:42:35,354
she danced in such a way

878
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,484
that I've never seen before.

879
00:42:36,486 --> 00:42:38,426
She's simply crazy.

880
00:42:38,428 --> 00:42:40,418
- She's always been that way.

881
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,570
But never as much as in the last

882
00:42:41,572 --> 00:42:44,813
fortnight since the engagement was broken off.

883
00:42:44,815 --> 00:42:48,752
- Yes, an affair that was to be sure.

884
00:42:48,754 --> 00:42:50,373
- You see that's better.

885
00:42:50,375 --> 00:42:52,522
- Mm-hmm.

886
00:42:52,524 --> 00:42:54,345
I swear I want it real.

887
00:42:54,349 --> 00:42:56,006
By once name her angel.

888
00:42:56,026 --> 00:42:58,031
- This is so weird.

889
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:59,374
Like I never thought Atticus

890
00:42:59,379 --> 00:43:01,637
was hot before but now that I'm doing

891
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,984
Miss Julie with him, all of a sudden

892
00:43:02,986 --> 00:43:04,888
I'm like strangely attracted to him.

893
00:43:05,691 --> 00:43:08,697
Yeah, I can see it.

894
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:10,666
- Right.

895
00:43:10,673 --> 00:43:13,110
- It's the end of the day for all of you.

896
00:43:14,104 --> 00:43:16,234
- It's just...

897
00:43:16,236 --> 00:43:19,863
- So good studio work today, everyone.

898
00:43:19,865 --> 00:43:23,502
Um, okay, so I just want you all to take

899
00:43:23,504 --> 00:43:25,819
home some work, okay?

900
00:43:25,821 --> 00:43:29,497
I want you to start thinking like you're in character in life.

901
00:43:29,499 --> 00:43:32,981
Just always be aware. What do I want?

902
00:43:34,585 --> 00:43:36,662
- Miss Julie is not a bitch,

903
00:43:36,672 --> 00:43:37,951
and that's my pet peeve

904
00:43:37,953 --> 00:43:40,398
that like so many people have that impression of her.

905
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,666
- No, that is not the word.

906
00:43:42,668 --> 00:43:43,972
Miss Julie, is...

907
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,426
It's complicated, she is oppressed.

908
00:43:48,428 --> 00:43:52,931
She feels powerless and and yet her status endows her

909
00:43:52,933 --> 00:43:54,533
with a power, but it's not real power.

910
00:43:54,535 --> 00:43:58,514
- Exactly, I mean, she decides to

911
00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:02,256
end her own life, she's disturbed.

912
00:44:02,258 --> 00:44:03,202
- Have you ever thought of

913
00:44:03,214 --> 00:44:06,120
her relationship to her father.

914
00:44:06,122 --> 00:44:09,788
- I think John is like, sexually driven, you know,

915
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:12,813
like all his energy sort of comes from his...

916
00:44:13,618 --> 00:44:17,205
You know, with this, yeah.

917
00:44:17,207 --> 00:44:20,829
Mm-hmm. Why do you say that?

918
00:44:20,831 --> 00:44:24,319
- Well, no it's, it's just like well

919
00:44:24,364 --> 00:44:27,666
so he and Miss Julie can only switch places in terms of

920
00:44:27,668 --> 00:44:31,269
status like after he slept with her, you know, so it's like

921
00:44:31,271 --> 00:44:36,682
his power struggle is resolved by sex.

922
00:44:36,687 --> 00:44:38,118
- Hmm.

923
00:44:38,129 --> 00:44:39,280
- One of the interesting things

924
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:41,980
I find about Christine is that she's

925
00:44:41,982 --> 00:44:44,364
this incredibly developed self-righteous Christian,

926
00:44:44,372 --> 00:44:48,009
and yet she sexually active with John.

927
00:44:48,011 --> 00:44:49,793
- Yeah, it is true. There is,

928
00:44:49,795 --> 00:44:51,715
there is a softness,

929
00:44:51,717 --> 00:44:54,795
uh, a sensuality to Christine that does not exist

930
00:44:54,985 --> 00:44:58,789
in Miss Julie in the same way. Miss Julie's not sexual,

931
00:44:58,799 --> 00:45:01,336
she's neurotic, sex terrifies her.

932
00:45:01,341 --> 00:45:02,305
- Yeah, and I find that

933
00:45:02,307 --> 00:45:04,069
contrast fascinating

934
00:45:04,104 --> 00:45:06,805
particularly, when you consider their different social decisions

935
00:45:06,807 --> 00:45:10,308
and how even though Christine isn't a lower social position

936
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:15,338
than Miss Julie, she's also a traitor in a way.

937
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,202
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a very interesting thought.

938
00:45:17,229 --> 00:45:18,724
- I'd love to have a scene in the

939
00:45:18,726 --> 00:45:25,524
pantomime where I'm just like washing my breasts.

940
00:45:25,526 --> 00:45:27,843
- My main question is,

941
00:45:27,853 --> 00:45:30,128
what are we hoping the audience will be left

942
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:36,444
with at the end of this play? I mean according to Strindberg,

943
00:45:36,446 --> 00:45:39,137
Miss Julie kills herself because of a degenerate

944
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:44,242
brain on account of her being female. And, and after she

945
00:45:44,244 --> 00:45:47,546
has sex with her valet, she has no other option but to

946
00:45:47,548 --> 00:45:50,849
kill herself because she's ruined. What are we asking

947
00:45:50,851 --> 00:45:52,838
a modern audience to take away from this?

948
00:45:52,848 --> 00:45:55,048
- There are always parallels, Hannah.

949
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:58,782
- Between Yale and 19th century Sweden.

950
00:45:58,784 --> 00:46:01,314
- Well, Yale is one of the most

951
00:46:01,316 --> 00:46:04,054
elite institutions of the country.

952
00:46:04,064 --> 00:46:08,066
We are the largest most profitable employer in New Haven,

953
00:46:08,068 --> 00:46:12,222
and yet we are tax exempt.

954
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:13,092
- I didn't mean that.

955
00:46:13,094 --> 00:46:14,073
- Yeah, and the people

956
00:46:14,075 --> 00:46:17,976
of New Haven depend on what a capricious student body that

957
00:46:17,978 --> 00:46:20,275
comes in from a couple of years and then leaves,

958
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:24,013
but the people stay here.

959
00:46:24,015 --> 00:46:27,586
- Well, do you think people will be able

960
00:46:27,588 --> 00:46:30,095
to draw that connection?

961
00:46:30,899 --> 00:46:32,836
Well, I want to stay as close

962
00:46:32,838 --> 00:46:35,544
as possible to Strindberg's intention

963
00:46:35,546 --> 00:46:38,847
which is the slice of life.

964
00:46:38,849 --> 00:46:42,696
Where we lead to lead us. I can't say.

965
00:46:42,698 --> 00:46:46,439
Will it inspire us to change?

966
00:46:46,441 --> 00:46:50,328
I hope so. There is always the hope.

967
00:46:51,937 --> 00:46:54,880
- I love that you call them your breasts.

968
00:46:54,888 --> 00:46:58,419
- Oh, what else would I call them?

969
00:46:58,421 --> 00:47:00,619
- It's just a proper name.

970
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:04,059
- Hannah, are you going on rehearsal tonight?

971
00:47:04,063 --> 00:47:04,862
- Oh, yeah, we will rehearse.

972
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:05,663
- Ella, how's your meeting

973
00:47:05,665 --> 00:47:06,494
with your Van Gogh?

974
00:47:06,496 --> 00:47:08,036
- Oh, it was really fun.

975
00:47:08,038 --> 00:47:08,914
We should talk about...

976
00:47:08,922 --> 00:47:10,834
- The same, did you talk about your backstory?

977
00:47:10,836 --> 00:47:12,317
- Yeah, like my history was John.

978
00:47:12,326 --> 00:47:13,125
- I know, we talk so much about my

979
00:47:13,127 --> 00:47:15,834
relationship with my parents. My meeting

980
00:47:15,836 --> 00:47:17,357
went like way over so long.

981
00:47:17,365 --> 00:47:19,210
- That's great.

982
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:20,011
- I'm so hungry.

983
00:47:20,013 --> 00:47:20,834
Do you want to get lunch?

984
00:47:20,836 --> 00:47:26,379
- Um, yeah, sure. Oh, do you want to come?

985
00:47:26,381 --> 00:47:28,346
- Well, I have to write out every beat of Miss Julie

986
00:47:28,348 --> 00:47:29,879
by tonight in order to be ready for

987
00:47:29,881 --> 00:47:34,383
rehearsal, so, so maybe another time.

988
00:47:34,385 --> 00:47:35,184
- Yeah.

989
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:37,243
- Too bad. All right, let's go, Ella.

990
00:47:37,257 --> 00:47:38,902
That's why I'm not eating in the dining hall.

991
00:47:44,429 --> 00:47:47,145
- Oh my God. This cake.

992
00:47:47,147 --> 00:47:48,534
- Isn't it amazing?

993
00:47:49,338 --> 00:47:53,157
- It's so good.

994
00:47:53,172 --> 00:47:55,357
- You have to be careful though.

995
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,075
I gained so much weight my freshman year

996
00:47:57,077 --> 00:47:59,545
because I ate so much of it. It's right

997
00:47:59,561 --> 00:48:02,376
next to old campus so it was torture.

998
00:48:02,378 --> 00:48:04,382
- Well, I would never have known you

999
00:48:04,384 --> 00:48:06,411
look great now, you know.

1000
00:48:06,414 --> 00:48:09,277
- My mom wouldn't let me hear the end of it.

1001
00:48:09,289 --> 00:48:10,345
She put me on the most

1002
00:48:10,359 --> 00:48:13,270
insane workout regimen.

1003
00:48:13,272 --> 00:48:15,650
My mom, she's crazy.

1004
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,064
- Oh, no!

1005
00:48:18,203 --> 00:48:21,499
- Which is why if I ever have kids, I'm gonna let them eat

1006
00:48:21,501 --> 00:48:22,603
all the cake they want.

1007
00:48:24,375 --> 00:48:26,806
- Do you think you want to have kids?

1008
00:48:26,808 --> 00:48:29,379
- Actually, I'd love to like donate my

1009
00:48:29,384 --> 00:48:33,111
eggs to all my gay friends.

1010
00:48:33,113 --> 00:48:34,984
Kids are career killers and body killers.

1011
00:48:34,986 --> 00:48:36,871
So obviously, I don't want my own,

1012
00:48:36,873 --> 00:48:39,417
but this way I know they're growing

1013
00:48:39,419 --> 00:48:41,611
up in such a loving artistic homes.

1014
00:48:55,972 --> 00:48:58,183
- Isn't that an anarchy sign?

1015
00:48:58,189 --> 00:48:59,721
- No, it's an A.

1016
00:48:59,725 --> 00:49:00,526
- What kind of professor

1017
00:49:00,541 --> 00:49:02,180
is writing Anarchy signs on your paper?

1018
00:49:02,983 --> 00:49:04,838
-Stop.

1019
00:49:07,157 --> 00:49:09,913
- So this theory says that mammals

1020
00:49:09,915 --> 00:49:13,048
and humans aren't adapted to one environment.

1021
00:49:13,053 --> 00:49:16,655
-Exactly were completely different depending on where ancestors

1022
00:49:16,657 --> 00:49:18,644
lived and we haven't stopped evolving

1023
00:49:18,654 --> 00:49:21,815
even since agriculture was introduced.

1024
00:49:21,817 --> 00:49:24,563
- Which means that our great, great, great,

1025
00:49:24,565 --> 00:49:29,060
great grandkids could all evolved to be clones of Sean Penn.

1026
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:33,982
- Yeah, or they could have a dramatic

1027
00:49:33,984 --> 00:49:35,779
stress reaction to politicians.

1028
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:42,192
- Speaking of dramatic, you spend a lot

1029
00:49:42,202 --> 00:49:43,984
of time with Maxine lately.

1030
00:49:43,993 --> 00:49:46,515
-  Oh, yeah, I really like her, actually.

1031
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:47,656
- Really?

1032
00:49:47,658 --> 00:49:48,929
I could not see you guys being friends.

1033
00:49:50,644 --> 00:49:51,508
- Why not?

1034
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:52,711
- Well, I don't know.

1035
00:49:52,713 --> 00:49:58,293
You know, Maxine is Maxine. I mean, she's my friend, but

1036
00:49:58,298 --> 00:50:01,099
you both are actors, so I feel like you guys would

1037
00:50:01,101 --> 00:50:03,772
be in constant competition with one another.

1038
00:50:03,774 --> 00:50:05,794
- Well, aren't you kind of technically

1039
00:50:05,796 --> 00:50:08,211
in competition with your teammates

1040
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:09,407
to be like starter and stuff?

1041
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:10,483
- No, that's way different.

1042
00:50:10,485 --> 00:50:12,077
We're all part of the same team so...

1043
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:16,246
- And so are we, in a way.

1044
00:50:16,248 --> 00:50:17,668
I don't know. I just think we're really

1045
00:50:17,673 --> 00:50:19,815
getting to connect to each other a lot.

1046
00:50:19,829 --> 00:50:23,903
- Hmm. This is why I like you.

1047
00:50:23,909 --> 00:50:25,029
You see the world

1048
00:50:25,031 --> 00:50:26,215
in such a cute way.

1049
00:50:40,956 --> 00:50:42,185
- Yeah, it is how it is.

1050
00:50:42,187 --> 00:50:44,953
- I know.

1051
00:50:44,955 --> 00:50:47,175
Did you ever believe in past lives?

1052
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:49,508
- Like reincarnation?

1053
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:54,352
- I don't know. Sometimes, I think I was Royal in a past life.

1054
00:50:54,354 --> 00:50:55,433
Like a princess or something.

1055
00:50:57,182 --> 00:50:57,981
I mean, you're such

1056
00:50:57,983 --> 00:50:59,389
a good actor so you never did it before,

1057
00:50:59,391 --> 00:51:02,853
So maybe you did in past life.

1058
00:51:02,855 --> 00:51:04,558
- Actually, it's funny you say that

1059
00:51:04,568 --> 00:51:07,133
because sometimes it feels that way.

1060
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:10,358
- Yeah.

1061
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,712
Uh- I had a sister who died.

1062
00:51:13,714 --> 00:51:14,793
- Oh my god.

1063
00:51:14,795 --> 00:51:21,479
- When I was 12, she was 16 and she was like, this amazing

1064
00:51:21,481 --> 00:51:24,818
actor and I mean, that's why I never did it before.

1065
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:30,889
In my family, it was her thing, but now when I do it, I feel

1066
00:51:30,891 --> 00:51:36,805
like she's alive in me. Like something's taking over.

1067
00:51:36,807 --> 00:51:38,742
-Oh, my God!

1068
00:51:38,744 --> 00:51:46,244
I just got chills. That's so beautiful and sad.

1069
00:51:46,246 --> 00:51:48,884
Can I ask, how did she die?

1070
00:51:48,894 --> 00:51:53,612
-Oh, w- w- we were on a family ski trip and she fell

1071
00:51:53,614 --> 00:51:59,032
and hit her head. She seemed like fine at first just sleepy.

1072
00:51:59,034 --> 00:52:02,821
She went back to the lodge to rest and the next morning

1073
00:52:02,823 --> 00:52:04,830
she just didn't wake up.

1074
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,019
- Oh my God.

1075
00:52:06,021 --> 00:52:11,454
- It was a traumatic brain injury, epidural hematoma.

1076
00:52:11,456 --> 00:52:17,455
- Oh, God, that is so tragic.

1077
00:52:17,457 --> 00:52:18,932
You've had tragedy in your life.

1078
00:52:18,934 --> 00:52:20,235
I'm sorry. It's just something

1079
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,752
I never really liked don't like to talk about.

1080
00:52:21,758 --> 00:52:22,987
- I'm just curious.

1081
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:26,525
tongue clicks]

1082
00:52:26,527 --> 00:52:27,327
Wait here.

1083
00:52:27,337 --> 00:52:29,142
I wanna show you something.

1084
00:52:34,493 --> 00:52:37,758
- Oh, my God. You got a bird.

1085
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:40,342
- Her name is Serena.

1086
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,960
- Like Miss Julie's. -Just like.

1087
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:48,270
- I'm so glad we're getting close.

1088
00:52:48,272 --> 00:52:53,046
I think it's gonna really have to show.

1089
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,605
- Boo. - Oh, my God.

1090
00:52:57,607 --> 00:52:59,211
Atticus, you scared me.

1091
00:52:59,213 --> 00:53:00,859
Are we still on for tonight?

1092
00:53:00,861 --> 00:53:03,081
- Of course. - Oh, Great.

1093
00:53:03,083 --> 00:53:05,383
I've been so busy with like the play and class and stuff.

1094
00:53:05,385 --> 00:53:07,756
It'll be nice to finally get to spend some time together.

1095
00:53:07,758 --> 00:53:08,557
- You're a great actress.

1096
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:11,429
- Hello, hello. Hello, what are we doing tonight?

1097
00:53:11,431 --> 00:53:12,230
- Oh, um.

1098
00:53:12,232 --> 00:53:14,472
- Don't tell me, I already know. Red is having an art

1099
00:53:14,474 --> 00:53:16,099
show and I want you to be my date.

1100
00:53:16,101 --> 00:53:17,706
- Oh, I would love to, Maxine,

1101
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:19,938
but I actually I can't tonight.

1102
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:22,773
- Oh, why, what are you doing?

1103
00:53:22,803 --> 00:53:27,793
- Um, I just have like an essay and stuff.

1104
00:53:27,801 --> 00:53:31,513
- Oh. - Oh, hello actors. Uh,

1105
00:53:31,515 --> 00:53:36,615
I'm sorry, I'm late. Let's, uh, just start from the scene right

1106
00:53:36,617 --> 00:53:39,778
after the pantomime, right after Miss Julie enters. Okay?

1107
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:40,581
- Okay.

1108
00:53:41,443 --> 00:53:43,881
- Hoo.

1109
00:53:45,516 --> 00:53:47,553
- Charlie Cavalier, you are to be sure

1110
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:49,078
to run away from your partner.

1111
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,930
- On the contrary, Miss Julie. I've been hurrying

1112
00:53:51,932 --> 00:53:57,122
as you see to find the girl I left behind.

1113
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:58,710
- Do you know that none of the others

1114
00:53:58,712 --> 00:54:01,940
dance like you do? But why do you

1115
00:54:01,942 --> 00:54:06,029
go about in Livery on a holiday evening? Take it off at once.

1116
00:54:06,031 --> 00:54:08,747
- In that case, I must ask you to give me leave Miss Julie,

1117
00:54:08,749 --> 00:54:10,403
from my crew hangs up here.

1118
00:54:10,405 --> 00:54:12,781
- Is he bashful on my account?

1119
00:54:13,654 --> 00:54:17,360
Just for changing a goat. As far as I'm

1120
00:54:17,362 --> 00:54:24,032
concerned, he can stay here. I'll turn around.

1121
00:54:24,034 --> 00:54:27,075
- Bye, I'll leave, Miss Julie.

1122
00:54:32,272 --> 00:54:36,880
- Tell me, Christine. Is John your fiance?

1123
00:54:36,882 --> 00:54:39,863
He acts so familiar with you.

1124
00:54:39,865 --> 00:54:45,465
- Fiance. Well, I suppose so at least we say we are.

1125
00:54:45,485 --> 00:54:49,688
- What do you mean? - Well, Miss Julie you had a fiancé.

1126
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:51,221
- Yes, but we were properly engaged.

1127
00:54:51,236 --> 00:54:52,190
- I know but nothing at all

1128
00:54:52,192 --> 00:54:53,058
came with it.

1129
00:55:00,235 --> 00:55:01,461
- I'm supposed you turn on.

1130
00:55:02,784 --> 00:55:04,393
- Um, and to my favorite.

1131
00:55:05,766 --> 00:55:08,103
So, how's rehearsal with Maxine going?

1132
00:55:08,117 --> 00:55:11,100
- They're good. Not as good as with you.

1133
00:55:11,109 --> 00:55:12,614
Well, it's really intense,

1134
00:55:12,616 --> 00:55:14,513
but lately I feel like we're really beginning to like connect

1135
00:55:14,515 --> 00:55:18,817
to each other. We're like, speak the same language.

1136
00:55:18,819 --> 00:55:22,420
- That is great because at first, you were kind of ambivalent.

1137
00:55:22,422 --> 00:55:26,254
Like, about Maxine and connecting to her.

1138
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:27,726
- It's actually pretty fascinating.

1139
00:55:27,728 --> 00:55:28,877
It's just a really good idea.

1140
00:55:28,879 --> 00:55:29,678
- Really?

1141
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,736
- Mm-hmm.

1142
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,085
You know, you're still

1143
00:55:32,087 --> 00:55:32,886
- Ooh.

1144
00:55:32,888 --> 00:55:35,018
- You know, you're surely adorable.

1145
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:36,001
- Oh.

1146
00:55:36,004 --> 00:55:37,175
- Would you mind.

1147
00:55:37,177 --> 00:55:38,230
- There is one scene...

1148
00:55:39,033 --> 00:55:40,403
- Maxine, what are you doing here?

1149
00:55:41,206 --> 00:55:43,276
- Ella, I thought you said you were busy tonight?

1150
00:55:43,278 --> 00:55:45,844
- Oh my gosh. Yeah, I forgot.

1151
00:55:45,846 --> 00:55:48,441
- Weird. Fortunately, we talked about have to register and

1152
00:55:48,443 --> 00:55:51,136
I saw you through the window. Look, what I stole.

1153
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:52,534
- Oh, nice,

1154
00:55:53,453 --> 00:55:56,414
- This is cute. It's like the servants night off.

1155
00:55:57,217 --> 00:56:00,699
- Yeah.

1156
00:56:01,501 --> 00:56:04,412
- Wow, this is almost edible.

1157
00:56:05,346 --> 00:56:06,145
- Do you wanna sit?

1158
00:56:07,188 --> 00:56:09,640
Actually, let's get out of here.

1159
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:13,248
We should do some cast bonding at my house.

1160
00:56:13,252 --> 00:56:14,231
- Um, okay.

1161
00:56:14,233 --> 00:56:16,218
-Yeah, let's do it.

1162
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:18,949
- Great, cast bonding, cast bonding.

1163
00:56:23,627 --> 00:56:24,425
- It's time for me to burn.

1164
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:45,904
- Okay, Ella, you're next oh, never have I ever. I don't

1165
00:56:45,906 --> 00:56:50,410
know. Smoke crack. Oh my God. Ella obviously, obviously.

1166
00:56:52,412 --> 00:56:56,411
- What the fuck, Atticus. - I didn't know it was it was.

1167
00:56:56,431 --> 00:56:57,232
- Oh my God!

1168
00:56:58,218 --> 00:57:07,526
Okay it's your turn. Never Have I Ever Had a sex dream

1169
00:57:07,528 --> 00:57:14,933
about Reuben. - Ew Maxine. - You did? - God it was one time, you

1170
00:57:14,935 --> 00:57:17,452
totally brought that up because I told you about it.

1171
00:57:17,633 --> 00:57:18,433
- What?

1172
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:21,002
- I guess I did it. Okay.

1173
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:22,599
- Is there a bathroom I can use?

1174
00:57:23,644 --> 00:57:26,426
- Um, yeah, there's one upstairs. Stop, Atticus.

1175
00:57:27,723 --> 00:57:31,702
Yeah. He has that, you know, he's that, he has that accent.

1176
00:57:32,195 --> 00:57:32,996
- The accent?

1177
00:57:34,437 --> 00:57:35,238
- He has.

1178
00:58:21,602 --> 00:58:25,804
Are you lost? - Sorry, I didn't know what door it was. We're

1179
00:58:25,806 --> 00:58:29,209
not done with the game, Christine go downstairs. What?

1180
00:58:30,611 --> 00:58:33,612
I'm hungry. Why isn't dinner ready? What did you just call

1181
00:58:33,614 --> 00:58:40,095
me - Ella? I said I'm hungry. Do you want some food?

1182
00:58:41,069 --> 00:58:43,935
- Oh, um, I think

1183
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:47,996
I'm gonna go actually. - Are you sure? It's only like 9 pm

1184
00:58:47,998 --> 00:58:51,329
- Yeah. I'm like, I'm really tired. All of a sudden

1185
00:58:51,331 --> 00:59:03,373
so. - Okay, suit yourself. After you.

1186
00:59:03,475 --> 00:59:04,276
- Thanks.

1187
00:59:10,937 --> 00:59:12,438
- There you guys are.

1188
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:13,811
- Ella's heading out

1189
00:59:14,046 --> 00:59:14,847
- Oh I'll walk you home.

1190
00:59:15,161 --> 00:59:15,962
- You don't have to.

1191
00:59:16,184 --> 00:59:16,985
- Nevermind.

1192
00:59:18,006 --> 00:59:19,347
- Aren't you the gentleman?

1193
00:59:20,674 --> 00:59:21,474
- It's not a big deal.

1194
00:59:25,951 --> 00:59:26,752
- Well

1195
00:59:28,405 --> 00:59:29,206
Bye.

1196
00:59:29,804 --> 00:59:30,950
See you tomorrow.

1197
00:59:31,275 --> 00:59:32,076
- Bye

1198
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:42,783
Have you ever had a moment with Maxine where you feel like

1199
00:59:43,283 --> 00:59:47,566
she's not really there. Like in the present moment, not herself.

1200
00:59:47,568 --> 00:59:52,893
Like all the time. - Well, I just mean She scares me sometimes.

1201
00:59:53,894 --> 00:59:59,097
Well, she's controlling but it's her part, she's really going

1202
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:03,103
for it. I admire it. - Yeah. We all are.

1203
01:00:05,145 --> 01:00:08,939
Yep. Do, do you wanna come up?

1204
01:00:09,754 --> 01:00:15,074
Actually I've been thinking, so Maxine and I were talking

1205
01:00:15,115 --> 01:00:19,217
about sublimation about how we can make ourselves more

1206
01:00:19,219 --> 01:00:24,523
powerful on stage and I kind of want all my Sexual Energy

1207
01:00:24,525 --> 01:00:28,927
to be bottled up so it can just explode on stage because

1208
01:00:28,929 --> 01:00:29,733
I feel like that's what Jean is like. Like he's bottled

1209
01:00:29,735 --> 01:00:37,157
up. - Oh. - It's just my process.

1210
01:00:37,732 --> 01:00:39,356
It has nothing to do with you, obviously

1211
01:00:39,358 --> 01:00:52,751
No, no. I get it. - Okay. Night -Goodnight And that's why when

1212
01:00:52,753 --> 01:00:55,754
naturalism is effective, it should feel like you've walked

1213
01:00:55,756 --> 01:00:58,757
in on a slice of life. As if the moment, we're watching

1214
01:00:58,759 --> 01:01:02,360
began without an audience and will continue without one

1215
01:01:02,362 --> 01:01:09,069
after we've stopped watching. Okay, any questions? Ella

1216
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:14,472
basically, I was just wondering naturalism was super revolutionary

1217
01:01:14,474 --> 01:01:18,076
in its time because no one was using real props or hiding

1218
01:01:18,078 --> 01:01:22,583
the lights, but don't movies kind of make naturalism obsolete?

1219
01:01:22,683 --> 01:01:26,484
Like can naturalism in the theater still surprise audiences

1220
01:01:26,486 --> 01:01:29,788
today? - That's a really good question. Would anyone like

1221
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:36,094
to answer? Yes, Maxine. - well, I think it can in extreme

1222
01:01:36,096 --> 01:01:40,198
circumstances. Like what? Well, you know, naturalism. That's

1223
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:45,904
more than just lights or makeup. Like having real food

1224
01:01:45,906 --> 01:01:50,408
on stage or using a real loaded gun? Yes. That would surprise

1225
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:54,412
an audience not that I'm recommending. it. Does that answer

1226
01:01:54,414 --> 01:02:00,621
your question, Ella? Yeah, it totally does. What is that?

1227
01:02:01,822 --> 01:02:04,923
I was thinking Christine should be cooking an actual kidney

1228
01:02:04,925 --> 01:02:09,229
in the first scene, since this is the smell of her world.

1229
01:02:15,836 --> 01:02:20,238
I think I'm going to be sick. This is her dinner. I just

1230
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,241
want to be true to naturalism. It's what Strindberg would

1231
01:02:23,243 --> 01:02:28,797
have wanted. That's an excellent idea, Ella. - Wait, that was

1232
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:31,577
totally right. - This is a great impulse.

1233
01:02:31,591 --> 01:02:32,552
Let it sink in a little bit.

1234
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:36,839
This is her world everyday.

1235
01:02:38,659 --> 01:02:40,786
You cannot escape.

1236
01:02:42,832 --> 01:02:44,501
What did you, yes, watch your impulse, yes

1237
01:02:44,503 --> 01:03:00,280
go for, yes. Yes. Yes. Delicious. Yes, yes, cast take notes.

1238
01:03:00,881 --> 01:03:07,337
I want everyone to start at Ella's level. The scene starts here.

1239
01:03:08,188 --> 01:03:15,300
Yes. It's just, I can tell. He doesn't like me. what you

1240
01:03:15,561 --> 01:03:18,091
Why would he not like you? He cast you

1241
01:03:18,093 --> 01:03:20,140
He doesn't react to anything I do in rehearsal.

1242
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:22,040
He's constantly giving me notes

1243
01:03:22,042 --> 01:03:24,449
Is that what a director supposed to do?

1244
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:26,407
- He hates me, Kate

1245
01:03:26,547 --> 01:03:29,089
I think he literally hates watching me.

1246
01:03:30,275 --> 01:03:32,526
Oh my God, do you even think I'm a good actress?

1247
01:03:32,528 --> 01:03:34,913
- Yes, of course. - You don't have to lie

1248
01:03:34,915 --> 01:03:37,543
to me. I'm not mad. I think you're great.

1249
01:03:39,681 --> 01:03:40,481
- Thanks

1250
01:03:41,021 --> 01:03:42,172
But you don't do theater?

1251
01:03:46,561 --> 01:03:47,752
Drink to my health.

1252
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:51,942
I believe the poor man is bashful

1253
01:03:55,971 --> 01:03:57,653
To my mistress' health.

1254
01:03:58,730 --> 01:03:59,531
- Bravo

1255
01:03:59,795 --> 01:04:01,181
Now, as a finishing touch

1256
01:04:01,567 --> 01:04:03,844
You must kiss my shoe.

1257
01:04:11,548 --> 01:04:12,348
- What is this?

1258
01:04:13,609 --> 01:04:14,407
Is there a food

1259
01:04:14,409 --> 01:04:17,127
like a ugly lizard or something? - No.

1260
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:17,952
Yeah. Yeah. So why are

1261
01:04:17,954 --> 01:04:20,160
you holding it like it's gonna crawl up your fucking arm.

1262
01:04:20,661 --> 01:04:25,889
Again. - Now as a Finishing Touch you must kiss my shoe.

1263
01:04:25,891 --> 01:04:27,508
No wonder why he doesn't respond to you.

1264
01:04:27,836 --> 01:04:29,287
You need to commend him more.

1265
01:04:29,469 --> 01:04:30,886
I need more power from you.

1266
01:04:30,897 --> 01:04:33,643
- Okay. Now as a finishing touch, you

1267
01:04:33,645 --> 01:04:34,474
must kiss my shoe.

1268
01:04:38,113 --> 01:04:39,284
- React to him!

1269
01:04:40,165 --> 01:04:40,966
Oh my God, okay.

1270
01:04:41,338 --> 01:04:43,926
This, this is dangerous, okay,

1271
01:04:44,084 --> 01:04:47,385
this is maybe even illegal, this is the first time he gets

1272
01:04:47,387 --> 01:04:56,595
this close to you. John, take her foot. - Now, as a Finishing

1273
01:04:56,597 --> 01:05:05,005
Touch. You must kiss my shoe.

1274
01:05:11,011 --> 01:05:11,957
That's better.

1275
01:05:15,866 --> 01:05:17,462
- That was intense. - Yeah.

1276
01:05:17,494 --> 01:05:19,750
I'm so sorry. I was like totally holding this back. - No, no, no

1277
01:05:19,752 --> 01:05:22,320
I'm just struggling so much with some of the connection

1278
01:05:22,322 --> 01:05:25,724
between our characters. I should think we do more practice.

1279
01:05:25,726 --> 01:05:31,029
Yeah, for sure. Like outside of rehearsal. Do you want

1280
01:05:31,031 --> 01:05:34,935
to go run lines at my place? Yeah,

1281
01:05:59,728 --> 01:06:01,119
- Kiss my shoe.

1282
01:06:23,283 --> 01:06:28,186
Okay, Christine, this is your chair. Okay? You have been

1283
01:06:28,188 --> 01:06:32,693
working all day and no one appreciates you and you're sleeping.

1284
01:06:38,498 --> 01:06:42,302
But don't you look like the gentleman in that coat? Charming.

1285
01:06:44,004 --> 01:06:47,330
You're flattering me? Who said I was flattering you?

1286
01:06:47,332 --> 01:06:49,297
- No, you have to  make it easier like this

1287
01:06:49,299 --> 01:06:51,209
this, this, this taxi cannot

1288
01:06:51,211 --> 01:06:56,014
be self-aware. You just have to be lose. Okay, yes, yes, shake

1289
01:06:56,016 --> 01:07:00,050
it. Do some shake. You too, Christine.

1290
01:07:06,112 --> 01:07:08,595
Yes, now you go flirt with him.

1291
01:07:11,129 --> 01:07:13,033
My father worked on the farm right beside yours.

1292
01:07:13,534 --> 01:07:16,334
And I saw you when you were a child, although you didn't

1293
01:07:16,336 --> 01:07:18,208
notice me. - Really?

1294
01:07:18,867 --> 01:07:21,530
- Yes. And I remember an incident in particular,

1295
01:07:22,442 --> 01:07:26,444
We mustn't speak about that. Oh yes. Tell me. - No. I really

1296
01:07:26,446 --> 01:07:29,404
can't. - Just please me. - Yes, yes, now both of you,

1297
01:07:29,406 --> 01:07:31,874
are you aware that there's another person in the

1298
01:07:31,952 --> 01:07:37,357
room? Yes, your fiancé is sitting right there in the chair,

1299
01:07:37,457 --> 01:07:41,560
while the lady of the house is coming on to you. Both of

1300
01:07:41,562 --> 01:07:43,862
you are acting, like there's no one else in here. You have

1301
01:07:43,864 --> 01:07:48,168
to feel her presence. Okay. Yes, let it affect you. Again.

1302
01:07:48,769 --> 01:07:53,171
Nice job, Christine. Come. Is it? So dangerous to tell me

1303
01:07:53,173 --> 01:07:56,376
now? It's not dangerous, but it's better to leave it alone.

1304
01:07:56,777 --> 01:08:01,281
Just look at her over there. She'll make a Charming wife,

1305
01:08:01,882 --> 01:08:05,784
perhaps she snores as well. She doesn't, she speaks in

1306
01:08:05,786 --> 01:08:09,287
her sleep. How do you know she talks in her sleep? I've

1307
01:08:09,289 --> 01:08:13,171
heard her I bet you fucking have. What else don't I know,

1308
01:08:13,173 --> 01:08:20,135
Christine? Tell me everything.

1309
01:08:31,126 --> 01:08:32,387
What else don't I know, Christine?

1310
01:08:32,818 --> 01:08:33,619
Tell me everything .

1311
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,721
- And I can't take it.

1312
01:08:46,827 --> 01:08:49,427
My old theater director always said there are no, small

1313
01:08:49,429 --> 01:08:50,561
parts, only small people.

1314
01:08:50,785 --> 01:08:53,232
No, but it's like I literally feel beneath her.

1315
01:08:53,935 --> 01:08:56,032
People, Ella.

1316
01:08:56,441 --> 01:08:57,242
Small people

1317
01:08:57,893 --> 01:08:59,144
There are just small people.

1318
01:09:00,766 --> 01:09:02,357
She's getting into my head.

1319
01:09:03,671 --> 01:09:05,262
Stay with me, Ella.

1320
01:09:06,903 --> 01:09:07,702
You just need to commit

1321
01:09:07,704 --> 01:09:09,434
to your work.

1322
01:09:15,065 --> 01:09:17,182
Brilliant. Well she is brilliant.

1323
01:09:19,043 --> 01:09:21,190
Yeah. The other one I don't. Nah, I don't know.

1324
01:09:22,251 --> 01:09:23,762
Yes, some actors just get the

1325
01:09:23,764 --> 01:09:33,113
work and some don't. Well, there's only so much I can do.

1326
01:09:34,274 --> 01:09:47,788
Now, it's too late now. Well, let's see if anything changes.

1327
01:09:51,996 --> 01:09:52,797
Atticus

1328
01:09:53,093 --> 01:09:56,642
There you are. Oh hey Maxie, you have classes by?

1329
01:09:56,706 --> 01:09:58,317
Oh Absolutely

1330
01:09:58,498 --> 01:10:02,300
not. I had to complain to you. I know it's going to help

1331
01:10:02,302 --> 01:10:09,508
us. Oh yeah cool. We need to have sex. Like our characters

1332
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:12,310
need to actually have sex in the offstage sex scene. We

1333
01:10:12,312 --> 01:10:17,816
need to know what they're feeling. I don't know. It sounds

1334
01:10:17,818 --> 01:10:21,820
little bit extreme. Also, what about Ella? Naturalism is

1335
01:10:21,822 --> 01:10:27,027
Extreme, Atticus. How else will I return to Stage? Ravaged

1336
01:10:27,528 --> 01:10:31,029
clutching my last shred of dignity. Well, you my now

1337
01:10:31,031 --> 01:10:35,133
powerful valet convince me to kill myself. We just like

1338
01:10:35,135 --> 01:10:39,538
talk about it. Let me ask you something, Atticus, did Sean

1339
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:42,643
Penn get to where he is now by just talking about it.

1340
01:10:45,245 --> 01:10:49,948
No he didn't. No, Atticus. He didn't you know what? You're

1341
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:54,553
right. He he didn't. This is your time, Atticus. You need

1342
01:10:54,555 --> 01:10:58,156
to claim it. If Sean Penn is having sex then I'm having

1343
01:10:58,158 --> 01:11:16,975
sex. Oh, we talk about. We talk for a second. Why are you

1344
01:11:16,977 --> 01:11:20,478
avoiding me? Isn't it obvious? Can we please have some

1345
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:24,583
privacy? I don't think that's a good idea. Hannah, it's

1346
01:11:24,585 --> 01:11:32,390
okay. I really think there's been a misunderstanding. What

1347
01:11:32,392 --> 01:11:35,093
addict is seems pretty clear to me, you haven't answered

1348
01:11:35,095 --> 01:11:38,396
my text in a week. You leave right after rehearsal. Now,

1349
01:11:38,398 --> 01:11:41,900
can you please tell me what's going on? Atticus. You and

1350
01:11:41,902 --> 01:11:46,104
her are having sex after we? Who Maxine? Your think I like

1351
01:11:46,106 --> 01:11:56,517
Maxine No, fucking way. I really like I really like you.

1352
01:11:57,518 --> 01:12:00,120
I auditioned for the show because I saw that you were auditioning,

1353
01:12:01,121 --> 01:12:03,624
whatever's happening with Maxine. It's just for the role

1354
01:12:03,724 --> 01:12:06,825
just for the role. Yeah. What is your excuse for my character?

1355
01:12:06,827 --> 01:12:11,129
It's purely mental. It's called acting Atticus. Why don't

1356
01:12:11,131 --> 01:12:14,533
you try acting like you like her? Sorry, Ella, I'm doing

1357
01:12:14,535 --> 01:12:20,338
my best here. I really want to show the best it can possibly

1358
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:26,144
be. No, I'm sorry. You're right. We both need to make it

1359
01:12:26,146 --> 01:12:39,057
the best it can possibly be. You just killed your bird.

1360
01:12:39,059 --> 01:12:43,161
How do you react? Oh, kill me, kill me, too. If you can

1361
01:12:43,163 --> 01:12:47,265
kill an innocent animal without your hands, shaking, help

1362
01:12:47,267 --> 01:12:53,872
me. Christine help me get this man. Laughs. What a pretty

1363
01:12:53,874 --> 01:12:57,175
sight for a holiday morning. What? A dirty mess. You've

1364
01:12:57,177 --> 01:13:03,884
been. I'm sorry. Can we stop for a sec? Sure. It's just

1365
01:13:04,184 --> 01:13:06,885
the real kidney has helped me so much in rehearsal and

1366
01:13:06,887 --> 01:13:11,590
I just think we should have a real bird too. oh yeah. But

1367
01:13:11,592 --> 01:13:15,694
that might be a little bit hard but okay. Continue. It's

1368
01:13:15,696 --> 01:13:18,997
just the whole point of naturalism is that there's no fake

1369
01:13:18,999 --> 01:13:23,604
props. So how can we possibly react to a stuffed bird?

1370
01:13:23,704 --> 01:13:27,806
You know what she's right after all. Strindberg said we

1371
01:13:27,808 --> 01:13:30,609
are no longer content to see a thing happen. We want to

1372
01:13:30,611 --> 01:13:33,712
know how it happens and Strindberg said,  those who

1373
01:13:33,714 --> 01:13:38,316
don't accept evil never get anything good. Hold up. Where are

1374
01:13:38,318 --> 01:13:43,308
we going to get a real bird from? Well, Maxine has one.

1375
01:13:43,724 --> 01:13:46,625
Serena well, I'm sure she wouldn't mind lending it to

1376
01:13:46,627 --> 01:13:49,127
us for the sake of our performance. It's not really lending

1377
01:13:49,129 --> 01:13:53,732
and if we kill it, well, I just been so inspired by Maxine's

1378
01:13:53,734 --> 01:13:56,835
commitment to naturalism. It would be a shame to cop out

1379
01:13:56,837 --> 01:14:04,344
now, right next scene. I'll gladly offer Serena really.

1380
01:14:05,746 --> 01:14:18,759
Wow. That's really generous. Of course. Little Serena.

1381
01:14:21,261 --> 01:14:27,367
Must you die by the hand of your own mistress. Such a shame.

1382
01:14:27,768 --> 01:14:31,872
What a shame? Well, I was just thinking about the ending

1383
01:14:32,773 --> 01:14:37,075
after all these months of striving for Perfection will

1384
01:14:37,077 --> 01:14:41,780
never actually achieve true naturalism. What are you talking

1385
01:14:41,782 --> 01:14:46,484
about? Well, I mean Miss Julie suicide at the end. It's

1386
01:14:46,486 --> 01:14:48,687
not like you're ever actually going to commit to that.

1387
01:14:48,689 --> 01:14:53,594
No pun intended. Of course not, that would be crazy. Just saying

1388
01:14:54,294 --> 01:14:57,898
if we're going this far, it's a shame to stop now.

1389
01:14:58,899 --> 01:15:07,806
So close to perfection. Anyways, break a leg tomorrow. It's

1390
01:15:07,808 --> 01:15:16,717
almost like, You were born to play this role.

1391
01:15:21,822 --> 01:15:23,509
Hatchet is  good.

1392
01:16:01,461 --> 01:16:06,264
Mrs. Fletcher. Hi, I'm Ruben the director. Hello, I'm

1393
01:16:06,266 --> 01:16:17,778
so glad. Yes, of course I wouldn't miss him.

1394
01:16:18,591 --> 01:16:20,412
He didn't even wanna shake my hand.

1395
01:16:23,374 --> 01:16:24,175
Hmm

1396
01:16:27,076 --> 01:16:28,362
Don't touch me.

1397
01:16:29,089 --> 01:16:31,592
She has to meditate for two hours before she goes onstage.

1398
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:51,610
Everyone. HI! So let's gather around. So I cannot express

1399
01:16:51,612 --> 01:16:55,614
how proud I am for all this work we did together this

1400
01:16:55,616 --> 01:17:01,620
journey we embarked on and now the play is yours and I take

1401
01:17:01,622 --> 01:17:07,125
my hands out of it. Tonight, whatever happens is up to

1402
01:17:07,127 --> 01:17:08,664
you guys.

1403
01:17:13,582 --> 01:17:14,783
Break a leg, Ella.

1404
01:17:36,356 --> 01:17:40,358
Ms. Julie is mad again tonight. Absolutely mad. And so you're

1405
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:43,061
here, are you? My company the count to the station? When

1406
01:17:43,063 --> 01:17:45,365
I passed the bar to my way back, I went in to have a dance

1407
01:17:45,566 --> 01:17:48,969
and at that time, Miss Julie was dancing with that man forced.

1408
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:52,871
And when she saw me, she went straight towards me and asked

1409
01:17:52,873 --> 01:17:55,976
me to be her partner in the waltz and from that moment,

1410
01:17:56,176 --> 01:17:58,677
she danced in such a way that I've never seen anything

1411
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:02,180
of the kind of War. She's simply crazy. She's always been

1412
01:18:02,182 --> 01:18:06,785
that way. Never as much as the last Fortnight, the engagement

1413
01:18:06,787 --> 01:18:15,896
was broken off The fair that was to be sure. Drink to my health.

1414
01:18:17,898 --> 01:18:20,706
I believe the poor man is bashful

1415
01:18:25,163 --> 01:18:25,964
To my mistress' health!

1416
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:27,419
Bravo

1417
01:18:28,408 --> 01:18:33,754
Now as a Finishing Touch You must kiss my shoe.

1418
01:18:44,825 --> 01:18:50,028
First-rate. You should have been on the stage. This kind

1419
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:52,931
of thing must have go any further because anybody could

1420
01:18:52,933 --> 01:18:53,734
come in and see us

1421
01:18:57,554 --> 01:18:59,400
And que peasants

1422
01:19:00,930 --> 01:19:02,197
Here's the bird

1423
01:19:02,199 --> 01:19:03,395
What are they singing?

1424
01:19:04,101 --> 01:19:05,758
Some nasty line about a

1425
01:19:05,790 --> 01:19:06,921
Cheers the first, sing...

1426
01:19:07,292 --> 01:19:08,418
they are

1427
01:19:09,405 --> 01:19:10,612
It's best to fly

1428
01:19:11,064 --> 01:19:11,865
Why?

1429
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:13,881
But where to?

1430
01:19:15,206 --> 01:19:17,203
We can't go out, we can't go Christine's room.

1431
01:19:17,697 --> 01:19:18,497
Then come to my room.

1432
01:19:18,583 --> 01:19:23,292
You can rely on my being your real sincere

1433
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:24,971
You promise?

1434
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:27,420
I swear.

1435
01:20:26,153 --> 01:20:27,339
Hand it over.

1436
01:20:28,610 --> 01:20:31,543
Please, don't hurt it. Don't

1437
01:20:33,973 --> 01:20:36,696
No, I can't. Hand it over!

1438
01:20:36,787 --> 01:20:38,058
I'll do the trick.

1439
01:20:41,528 --> 01:20:43,299
My poor little Serena

1440
01:20:44,583 --> 01:20:45,792
must die at the hand  of your

1441
01:20:45,794 --> 01:20:52,050
own mistress. Be good enough not to make any scene. Your

1442
01:20:52,052 --> 01:20:53,884
life and well-being are at stake.

1443
01:20:56,341 --> 01:20:58,719
What? Is it, is it a live bird?

1444
01:21:00,417 --> 01:21:02,560
My eyes aren't working.

1445
01:21:06,032 --> 01:21:06,833
Grunts

1446
01:21:08,769 --> 01:21:12,771
Kill me. Kill me, too. If you can kill an innocent animal

1447
01:21:12,773 --> 01:21:13,844
without your hands shaking.

1448
01:21:14,221 --> 01:21:15,738
Oh I hate I'm in love with you.

1449
01:21:15,930 --> 01:21:17,381
It's not dead.

1450
01:21:23,329 --> 01:21:24,128
Oh there's blood

1451
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:24,931
between us now.

1452
01:21:27,822 --> 01:21:33,232
Help me, Christine. Help me get this man.

1453
01:21:34,537 --> 01:21:36,682
What kind of a pretty sight is this in a holiday

1454
01:21:36,684 --> 01:21:40,911
morning? And look at the dirty mess you made and your shrinking

1455
01:21:41,028 --> 01:21:42,467
how do you explain that?

1456
01:21:42,469 --> 01:21:43,270
Oh fuck

1457
01:21:44,249 --> 01:21:45,048
Christine,

1458
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:49,710
you're a woman and my friend. Help me against this monster.

1459
01:21:50,911 --> 01:22:01,520
I'm going to shave. Excuse me, excuse me. Listen to me,

1460
01:22:01,522 --> 01:22:04,923
Christine, you must listen to me, I'll tell you everything,

1461
01:22:04,925 --> 01:22:08,627
I don't want to know anything. Listen to me. What is it?

1462
01:22:08,629 --> 01:22:11,630
Then your foolish Behavior with John. He wants to run away

1463
01:22:11,632 --> 01:22:14,032
with me. Doesn't that sound? Wonderful. And what am I supposed

1464
01:22:14,034 --> 01:22:16,712
to do? You can come too. You can be the cook,

1465
01:22:16,726 --> 01:22:17,525
we'll start a hotel.

1466
01:22:17,527 --> 01:22:19,538
I don't want to go with you. I don't want to cook for a

1467
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:22,340
man who barely acknowledges me as a human being. John

1468
01:22:22,342 --> 01:22:25,443
Oh please. Yes, John treats me like a prop. You're so fucking

1469
01:22:25,445 --> 01:22:29,750
obsessed with him. No, I'm not, he sucks. He's selfish and

1470
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:35,854
narcissistic and you are too and I don't want anything more

1471
01:22:35,856 --> 01:22:37,372
to do with either of you.

1472
01:22:39,622 --> 01:22:42,349
What the fuck are they doing?

1473
01:22:42,382 --> 01:22:46,186
No, no, Christine, Christine, um,

1474
01:22:46,568 --> 01:22:49,465
I'm sorry, you're right.

1475
01:22:49,490 --> 01:22:51,469
I feel like I've spent so much time trying to belittle,

1476
01:22:51,471 --> 01:23:00,781
you. No, It's okay. I made mistakes too. No, you were so

1477
01:23:00,881 --> 01:23:09,287
much better, and I was so fucking jealous of you and I

1478
01:23:09,289 --> 01:23:17,397
was petty, I was jealous of you and I just feel like

1479
01:23:18,909 --> 01:23:19,710
Oh fuck

1480
01:23:22,703 --> 01:23:29,309
My father, he's home. What? I can't be here when he's home.

1481
01:23:29,409 --> 01:23:36,214
What do I do? Run away with me? What? Let's go run away

1482
01:23:36,216 --> 01:23:38,416
with me. Come with me. Let's get out of this place. I hate

1483
01:23:38,418 --> 01:23:41,920
it here. I didn't do it. Fucking plan. Come with me before

1484
01:23:41,922 --> 01:23:49,429
it's too late. Okay, okay.

1485
01:24:08,348 --> 01:24:09,635
What do you think you're doing?

1486
01:24:14,667 --> 01:24:16,383
That was actually really cool.

1487
01:24:17,157 --> 01:24:23,063
I agree. I'm also really glad my bird didn't die. Sorry,

1488
01:24:23,864 --> 01:24:27,367
it's fine. And sorry about the whole killing yourself thing.

1489
01:24:28,068 --> 01:24:30,268
I mean you weren't actually considering that were you?

1490
01:24:30,270 --> 01:24:37,175
What? No. What happened? How is he? He's getting 15 stitches

1491
01:24:37,177 --> 01:24:41,880
in his right hand. Oh, I hope you girls realize how many

1492
01:24:41,882 --> 01:24:46,186
college regulations you broke. We're really sorry. I mean,

1493
01:24:46,286 --> 01:24:49,389
someone's in the hospital and you completely jeopardize.

1494
01:24:49,489 --> 01:24:54,392
Reuben's situation. I'm never having a wire Ste director,

1495
01:24:54,394 --> 01:24:57,295
work with undergrads again. We were just trying to be

1496
01:24:57,297 --> 01:25:02,801
authentic, authentic. It was manic. Obviously, have you

1497
01:25:02,803 --> 01:25:15,013
ever read the handbook? Hi. Hi, we're so sorry. You know,

1498
01:25:15,015 --> 01:25:17,716
all these years I had so many problems with strindberg's

1499
01:25:17,718 --> 01:25:26,126
piece and you change that. Thank you.

1500
01:25:27,399 --> 01:25:28,200
What?

1501
01:25:29,574 --> 01:25:30,374
Oh my God.

1502
01:25:37,037 --> 01:25:39,738
I can't believe is banning us from performance

1503
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:42,741
and only letting us do Tech for an entire year. I know

1504
01:25:42,743 --> 01:25:47,447
it sucks. Honestly. I've been taking a break from theater.

1505
01:25:48,048 --> 01:25:51,349
It's so annoying. Look, what am I supposed to do? It's

1506
01:25:51,351 --> 01:25:54,052
restrictive and they do all these shitty place by these

1507
01:25:54,054 --> 01:25:56,181
19th century misogynist.

1508
01:25:57,516 --> 01:25:58,316
I like

1509
01:26:19,441 --> 01:26:20,240
You know,

1510
01:26:20,242 --> 01:26:23,218
we should make film. - Us?

1511
01:26:23,503 --> 01:26:24,304
- No, him.

1512
01:26:24,922 --> 01:26:25,723
Yes, us.

1513
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:29,758
Like write it and it? - Yeah.

1514
01:26:30,509 --> 01:26:31,855
On our own terms.

1515
01:26:32,892 --> 01:26:33,693
I like it.

1516
01:26:36,797 --> 01:26:49,608
Oh my God, this cake is so fucking good. Yeah, he can't be on

1517
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:55,315
our film.

1518
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:25,260
This is not a perfect time and not a perfect place.

1519
01:27:25,797 --> 01:27:31,172
This is not a paradise and not a state of grace.

1520
01:27:31,694 --> 01:27:35,578
Maybe we could wait forever

1521
01:27:35,784 --> 01:27:39,858
But we're together now

1522
01:27:39,908 --> 01:27:42,145
For a while

1523
01:27:43,475 --> 01:27:48,500
Nothing is ever perfect, that's it all.

1524
01:27:49,084 --> 01:27:51,557
After all

1525
01:27:55,726 --> 01:27:58,609
These are not the perfect words.

1526
01:27:58,630 --> 01:28:01,002
This is not the perfect song

1527
01:28:01,189 --> 01:28:06,374
But if you're still afraid to see then maybe I can sing

1528
01:28:06,437 --> 01:28:07,238
along

1529
01:28:07,630 --> 01:28:11,298
This is not a perfect sadness

1530
01:28:11,321 --> 01:28:15,355
But we imagined more

1531
01:28:15,447 --> 01:28:17,800
For a while

1532
01:28:18,870 --> 01:28:22,393
Maybe we'll be happy after all

1533
01:28:24,858 --> 01:28:28,101
After all

1534
01:28:30,580 --> 01:28:34,323
This is not a perfect

1535
01:28:36,957 --> 01:28:41,642
But this is where you have to begin in

1536
01:28:42,459 --> 01:28:47,049
This is not a perfect world

1537
01:28:47,968 --> 01:28:53,318
But you are welcome, you are welcome

1538
01:28:53,934 --> 01:28:58,378
Welcome in it

1539
01:29:00,084 --> 01:29:05,600
You are here and I am here and love and fear and hate are here

1540
01:29:05,806 --> 01:29:06,607
But everything

1541
01:29:06,847 --> 01:29:11,491
that isn't perfect doesn't have to disappear.

1542
01:29:12,133 --> 01:29:14,395
Tears of joy and tears of laughter

1543
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:19,144
One big beautiful disaster now

1544
01:29:19,919 --> 01:29:22,777
We're alive

1545
01:29:23,670 --> 01:29:28,389
Maybe this is perfect after all

1546
01:29:28,423 --> 01:29:30,696
After all

1547
01:29:35,214 --> 01:29:40,755
This is not a perfect life

1548
01:29:40,866 --> 01:29:46,076
But this is where you have to begin in

1549
01:29:47,114 --> 01:29:52,059
This is not a perfect world

1550
01:29:52,121 --> 01:29:54,764
But you are welcome

1551
01:29:55,167 --> 01:29:55,968
You are welcome
