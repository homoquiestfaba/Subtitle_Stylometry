01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:12,433
And ingested
his mutagen-tainted flesh.

926
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:19,200
Doing so, a new strain
of rage was created,

927
01:07:19,233 --> 01:07:21,767
One which could infect
every living thing

928
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:24,167

in your crazy scheme.

of the earth.

938

apocalyptic.

it's never enough. *

1108
01:23:12,167 --> 01:23:14,300
* when you give up,
it's never enough. *

1109
01:23:14,333 --> 01:23:19,033
* or this could be
the day we rise. *

1110
01:23:19,067 --> 01:23:20,800
* when you give up,
it's never enough. *

1111
01:23:20,833 --> 01:23:22,767
* when you give up,
it's never enough. *

1112
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:31,000
*

1113
01:23:45,133 --> 01:23:49,100
* why can't you look
at me now? *

1114
01:23:49,133 --> 01:23:53,300
*

1115
01:23:53,333 --> 01:23:57,500
* why can't you look
at me now? *

1116
01:23:57,533 --> 01:24:05,600
*

1117
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:15,233
* the mother of nothing.

1118
01:24:15,267 --> 01:24:19,233
* the mother of sin.

1119
01:24:19,267 --> 01:24:23,533
* the father of decadence
within us. *

1120
01:24:23,567 --> 01:24:29,133
* a brother of suffering
inside. *

1121
01:24:29,167 --> 01:24:31,800
* I hope you like
what you've done to me. *

1122
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:33,800
* uneased by the thought
of me. *

1123
01:24:33,833 --> 01:24:40,233
* only through your suffering
will you learn to forget, *

1124
01:24:40,267 --> 01:24:42,367
* will you learn to forget,

1125
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,767
* through your suffering.

1126
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:49,067
* we need something new
you made up. *

1127
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:52,800
*

1128
01:24:52,833 --> 01:24:57,200
* or this could be
the day we rise. *

1129
01:24:57,233 --> 01:25:01,300
*

1130
01:25:01,333 --> 01:25:07,267
* I wonder why.

1131
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:15,400
* who will survive
when we try *

1132
01:25:15,433 --> 01:25:17,633
* with their life?

1133
01:25:17,667 --> 01:25:19,267
* when you give up,
it's never enough. *

1134
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:21,767
* when you give up,
it's never enough. *

1135
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,400
* when you give up,
it's never enough. *

1136
01:25:23,433 --> 01:25:25,800
* when you give up,
it's never enough. *

1137
01:25:25,833 --> 01:25:28,067
* when you give up,
it's never enough. *

1138
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:29,767
* when you give up,
it's never enough. *

1139
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:31,767
* when you give up,
when you give up, *

1140
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,633
* when you give up,
it's never enough. *
