what you're doing.

524
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:23,120
Keep it up, and all the haters
are going to have left is hate.

525
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,206
I appreciate that.

526
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,415
Later, y'all.

527
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:27,625

You got it, bro.

531
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,089

533
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,970
Don't listen to Tina.

534
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:43,637
She talks a lot of smack,
but she's a good girl.

535
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:49,108
Yeah, it's not her smack talk
that pisses me off.

536
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,065
I think
she might be right.

537
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,488
Was Tina right when
she said that you're

538
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:56,487
trying to win this thing
to get back at Luis?

539
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,653
Notjust Luis.

540
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,042
It's like, most of my life, people
told me I'd never be anything.

541
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:07,999
So, what is it
you wanted to be?

542
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,171
Honestly?

543
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:15,756
I want to be a dancer.
And I always have.

544
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,299
I think we
should go somewhere.

545
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:25,562
Okay. Where are we going?
Where are you taking me?

546
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,439
You'll see.
We're going to get cleaned up.

547
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,441

Yeah.

Whoo!

00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,463
How did you know
about all those places?

550
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,966
I'm a dance major
at NYU.

551
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:03,719
And part of our curriculum
is to experience the arts.

552
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,802
My head is just busting
with ideas right now.

553
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:09,593
All the stuff we could do,
like mixing the stuff we saw.

554
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,887
You know what I mean?
Like, if we go...

555
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,563

556
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:16,937

00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:23,232
Do you even realize what you
do with your choreography?

560
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:25,992
It's like you're telling
this beautiful story.

561
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,652
What?

562
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,412
"Beautiful"?

563
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,163
Yeah, I said it.
Beautiful.

564
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,994
What's wrong with that? Nothing.

565
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,081
Just, if that's the way you step to
girls, your game is pretty weak.

566
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:38,622
You might want to take
some lessons from Darnell.

567
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:40,586
What? Are you serious? Yeah!

568
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,091

569
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,296
Okay, I would never
do that, first of all.

what impresses you.

What's a brotha got
to do to get with you?

577
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:05,819
You need to quit.

578
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,950

I saw you.

You're out of

IS that what
the HD stands for?

718
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,950
No.
No, it stands for "High Def."

719
00:50:32,071 --> 00:50:33,118
Like, clear.

720
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:34,286

LUIS: Just her.

726
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,923
She couldn't quite
cut it with our crew,

Listen, we've decided
that because of your dancing

756
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:47,145
and the obvious tension between
you and my boy Luis here,

757
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,401

for great television.

Thank you.
Thank you.

761

We did it.

762
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,884
That was insane.

763
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,007
It was nuts.

764
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:18,305
Not just the way
we made the show,

765
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,428
but the way you
stood up to those judges.

766
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:24,221
I mean, you were like, "Hell no!
Y'all are going to check us out!"

Okay, I just wanted our crew
to have a fair shot.

I give you
mad props for that.

769

We finally feel like
a real crew, you know?

770
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:35,155
And that wouldn't have
happened if it wasn't for you.

771
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:36,361
I respect that.

772
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:39,072
You're welcome.

773

I'll get the other one.

Okay.

775
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,120
Make them save me
a slice, though,

776
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:51,459
I will.

I texted him.
He must still be taking his finals.

780
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:03,137
Finals? He could've skipped
those to come celebrate, man.

781
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,645
You don't skip finals, bro.
That's why they call them finals,

The boy is trying to
get his edu-macation on.

783
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:11,062
That don't make him any
different than the rest of us.

dance for a living.

785

Yeah, but we don't all have
filthy rich parents like he does.

786

talking about?

half Of Texas.

was amazing.

Tina, is he
bothering you?

811
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:22,672
No, he was just telling me how
much he liked our audition.

812
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:25,182
No, I said I like
your audition.

813
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:28,636
You're the one who brings
the heat to this group.

814
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:31,264
Tina, did he tell you that
you're too good for us

815
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:33,098
and that you should be
dancing with his crew?

816
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,017
Yeah, he did, but...

817
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,693
Tina, he's trying
to play you.

818
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:39,859
Hey, calm down.
I told him I would stay with the HDS.

Wen, good.

820
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:43,191
But you act like I ain't even
good enough to dance with them.

I diunw say mar.

822
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:45,903
Sounds like that's
what she's saying to me.

Stop starting trouble.

824
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:49,910
Leave our crew alone.

825
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,201
Tina, are you going to
let her dis you like that?

826
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,244
I mean, I know if someone
in my crew called me out,

827
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:55,375
we'd battle on the spot.

828
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:58,749
Wow! I am not calling her out.
And if we're going to battle,

829
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:02,336
we're going to do it as a crew
and take your sorry ass out.

830
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:04,513
And what's stopping you?

831
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:07,258
What's stopping you?

832
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:10,348
(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)

833
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:12,058
See that, Tina?

834
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:13,771
She's scared.

835
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:16,400
She's scared!

836
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:20,028
If you were on the 718, baby,
you wouldn't run from nothing.

837
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,150
Whatever.
