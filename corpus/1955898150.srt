Deep Blue Sea 2

THIRTEEN KILOMETERS OFF THE COASTS OF SOUTH AFRICA

00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,741
ILLEGAL FISHING VESSEL IN SHARK "NEVU"

4
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:54,849
We took a blacktip shark!

5
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,048
He's fighting !

6
00:00:58,258 --> 00:00:59,920
It's nice to hear!

7
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,825
Come on, Ru, come help me.

8
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:03,760
Help me, Ru.

9
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,231
Go.

10
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,904
Take the hook.

11
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,279
Take the hook. I hold it.

12
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,914
The hook.

13
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,754
It's good, I like.

14
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:35,919
Go, take wing, Ru!

15
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,091
Yes.

16
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,306
Its good.

17
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:57,876
Yes.

18
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,286
You're a killer, Mad Ru.

19
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,121
Come take a selfie.

20
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,924
Take a selfie.

21
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:36,417
- What joy ... - To all the sailors.

22
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:39,925
All ship in the 1-7-9 zone

23
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:44,431
I repeat the 1-7-9 area, please leave immediately the area.

24
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,130
What is this bullshit ?

25
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,102
If you see an orange smoke on the horizon, you are in danger.

26
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:01,512
Again, if you see an orange smoke, you are in immediate danger.

27
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,277
Regain the coast immediately.

28
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,278
Ru?

29
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,758
Do you think they should go?

30
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:18,729
You are crazy ? Kwame, it bites hard today.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,866
I want to go sheet.

32
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:28,136
And the last battle drained me of my strength.

33
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,038
Do not make your mop.

34
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,480
The radio did not mention the coastguard.

35
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,677
At every time, it's a greedy fishing boat.

36
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,083
You and I are going nowhere.

37
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,385
We're going fishing.

38
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,389
Come on, fishing.

39
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,692
What was that ?

40
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,368
It will be fine ?

41
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,567
Shit.

42
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,514
Yeah!

43
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,716
This is a big one, one!

44
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:14,242
That's why we're here! This is gold branch!

45
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:25,524
Ru, you saw that?

46
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,239
Have you ever seen sharks swim like that?

47
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,069
What are they doing ?

48
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:41,271
They bring on a silver platter.

49
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:04,963
Help !

50
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,297
Kwame !

51
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:13,669
- Shit. - Ru!

52
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,305
Kwame !

53
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:03,885
He has someone?

54
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:16,671
A cottage going nowhere

55
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:32,250
In the dark water

56
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,753
the blue sea

57
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:39,484
Changing dreams into nightmares

58
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:51,061
The against the tide of darkness

59
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:55,073
In the blue sea

60
00:07:55,141 --> 00:08:00,773
Drowning in the blue sea

61
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:09,289
Venturing against the current

62
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:29,839
Falling light

63
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:33,140
to the bottom

64
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:37,946
Changing dreams into nightmares

65
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:48,788
The against the tide of darkness

66
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,525
In the blue sea

67
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:59,595
Drowning in the blue sea

68
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,741
It's crazy that you have not eaten.

69
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,058
It's crazy that you have not eaten.

70
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,167
He would find me not to his liking.

71
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,133
The idea that white sharks are

72
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,540
killing machines that roam near the coast

73
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,203
looking for a swimmer chewable,

74
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,941
it is only the Hollywood fiction.

75
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:47,817
These magnificent creatures and unjustly represented

76
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:51,915
seek only fish or a large seal area.

77
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,159
Whenever a man is attacked,

78
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,559
the shark mistook something else.

79
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:00,028
Sharks are an important part of the ecosystem of our oceans.

80
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,328
FOUNDATION FIVE OCEANS

81
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:05,266
And unfortunately, they are killed

82
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:09,901
at an average rate of 100 million per year

83
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:13,207
for purposes as frivolous as a bowl of fin soup.

84
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:19,841
This is why the institute my mother founded,

85
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,615
Five Oceans Institute,

86
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,521
is dedicated to research on sharks

87
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,058
and public education

88
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,754
the importance of protecting species.

89
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:31,419
Yes ?

90
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:35,430
Your video shows you trying to swim with several varieties of sharks.

91
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,993
Are there a type of shark that you do not nageriez?

92
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,168
The bull shark.

93
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:45,175
This is the most dangerous shark.

94
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:48,578
It knocks its prey with the thick portion of the tail

95
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,915
to immobilize prior to cling to it as a pit bull.

96
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,615
Their bites are ten times stronger than that of the white shark, so ...

97
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,248
Yes, it would be dangerous to swim with them.

98
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,602
Aaron, you get me?

99
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,266
Received Trent. I see you.

100
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,138
Opens the barrier section 5f.

101
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:21,645
AKHEILOS COMPLEX

102
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,493
You go with this expression

103
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,433
on the face, I know you have something to say.

104
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:44,868
Yes, not one of which I am proud.

105
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,235
We had breakouts today.

106
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,036
- How many ? - The five.

107
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:52,836
That's five too many, man.

108
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,879
Yes, I know.

109
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,039
I have to check the outer barrier.

110
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,246
These fish are not out.

111
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,559
Finally, I want to thank you for having me.

112
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,264
Thank you.

113
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,036
Dr Calhoun.

114
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:31,249
- Yes ? - My name is Craig Burns.

115
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,182
What can I help you with ?

116
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,655
Pharmaceutical Durant.

117
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,789
I'm not a doctor of medicine. Where did this come from ?

118
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,760
My client, Mr. Durant, is a fan of your work.

119
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:46,765
He sees you as the best expert on sharks in the world.

120
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,231
He would like to see you for a new project.

121
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,468
A conservation project?

122
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,806
He prefers to call the human preservation.

123
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,205
So you continued the work with your mother.

124
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,904
It was she who taught me to love the ocean.

125
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,910
She taught me to respect it.

126
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,740
You're very quiet, Mr. Burns.

127
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,616
Why a pharmaceutical company wants to work with me?

128
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,720
Mr. Durant wants to answer your questions.

129
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,187
- When ? - Tomorrow.

130
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:21,093
- Fifty thousand dollars. Why ? - To share your expertise.

131
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:24,903
They are yours, Dr. Calhoun. Whether you work with us or not.

132
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,960
This is a down payment.

133
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:27,939
But if you choose to be part of the project,

134
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,737
Mr. Durant is ready to fund research

135
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,176
Five Oceans of the next five years.

136
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,008
And from what I've read your institute in need.

137
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,150
Was removed grant you, right?

138
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,323
Are not you curious as to what we do?

139
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,182
Aaron ?

140
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,385
What is the most important rule?

141
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:27,465
Do not piss into the wind and do not pull on Superman's cape.

142
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:33,634
No. It is the second most important rule, of course.

143
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:38,167
The most important is to always keep the green barriers.

144
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,275
And they are.

145
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,741
They were green this morning. This evening too.

146
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,183
I do not sleep at work.

147
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:51,953
So how do you explain that five shark had escaped?

148
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,756
Listen ... It's impossible.

149
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,229
I swear to you. Viewing.

150
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:04,032
You see ? The system works well. Exactly as I planned.

151
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:07,037
Yes I tell you that these sharks are out.

152
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,199
I do not understand ! Shit !

153
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:15,305
You see ? They avoid the electrified fence like the plague.

154
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:19,912
Wait a minute.

155
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,245
What is happening ?

156
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,322
What is that ?

157
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,084
A tunnel ?

158
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,794
There is a tunnel under the cable.

159
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,926
Sharks can not do that.

160
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,398
Or if ?

161
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,272
We must enlarge the barrier.

162
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,205
It will take a week to look for Cape Town Cable.

163
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,577
We did not this time.

164
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,347
- I talk to the boss? - Not yet.

165
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,183
I have an idea.

166
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,549
It's a joke?

167
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,582
Here Daniel and Leslie Kim.

168
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:35,219
Daniel is a neuropsychologist, neurobiologist Leslie.

169
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,957
Leslie, Daniel, here Misty Dr. Calhoun.

170
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,132
Misty defends the environment

171
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,225
and withdrew three shark species list

172
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,291
of endangered animals.

173
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,238
So a neuropsychologist, a neurobiologist

174
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:50,504
and defender sharks walk into a bar.

175
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:52,640
What is the fall?

176
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:56,210
There are not any. It's just a meeting of minds.

177
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,140
Excuse me, I must speak to the captain.

178
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,687
We should reach the complex by 1500 hours.

179
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:05,988
You have signed the nondisclosure clause?

180
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,390
I got a headache just by reading it.

181
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,157
So it's not just me.

182
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,391
It's just a lawyer who wants to justify his job.

183
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,933
- But you signed it? - Yes.

184
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,593
It's been a while we expect this opportunity.

185
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,139
You talk as if you already knew it was cool, Daniel.

186
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,106
C'est Carl Durant.

187
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,871
This guy has a lot of money and he does things with.

188
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,277
And after this weekend,

189
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,747
Besides having financings we do worry.

190
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,851
Yes, he gives his money to anyone who wants it.

191
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,216
We just got married, sorry for the affection in public.

192
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:36,919
Pardon.

193
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,351
It's crazy to make his bag

194
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,291
and go to sea without knowing what they will do there.

195
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,524
Yes, I did research on my side, but it did not stick.

196
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,366
I do not know at all why I'm here.

197
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,999
I guess we will find out together.

198
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,545
Here. Let's go.

199
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,084
- It's yours. - Your bag.

200
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,848
Attention.

201
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:25,327
Mike.

202
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:27,694
Welcome to Akheilos.

203
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,363
You mean Akheilos?

204
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,461
The child Zeus changed in shark?

205
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:36,340
It's him. Follow me, please.

206
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,736
Okay, put it on the road.

207
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:35,733
Mike, recharge the battery. I'll install other rings.

208
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,568
It takes another diver propulsion vehicle.

209
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,933
That did the trick.

210
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,046
I see you've met our CEO, Trent Slater.

211
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:51,645
Trent, voici Dr Misty Calhoun.

212
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:54,886
Can I ask you what's the point?

213
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:57,987
It reinforces the perimeter fence.

214
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,086
The entire complex is surrounded by these rings.

215
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:05,155
No, it is surrounded by an electrified wire which rests on the seabed.

216
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,664
These rings are covered with graphite,

217
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:09,793
an excellent conductor of electricity, as you know.

218
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,594
I use these rings to extend the reach of electricity.

219
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:14,971
For a little more ...

220
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,275
Insurance.

221
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,670
What you try to keep?

222
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,647
We especially try not to let them out.

223
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,811
They are sharks Bulldogs.

224
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,251
Why do you keep sharks in captivity Bulldogs?

225
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:36,988
Welcome. I see you've met our guinea pigs.

226
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:38,655
How many do you have ?

227
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,857
Five, including Bella.

228
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:45,028
- Carl Durant, you must be ... - Not interested in gossip.

229
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:48,705
You could explain to me what you do with ...

230
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:51,608
How do you call? Your guinea pigs?

231
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:54,941
- Very large guinea pigs. - Sharks do not like the labs.

232
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:59,513
I love your passion, yes,

233
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:02,019
but you allow? I'd like to finish the presentations.

234
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:05,485
- Yes, I'm Misty. - Hello.

235
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,762
Here Dr. Daniel Kim and Dr. Leslie Kim.

236
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,956
Daniel Leslie. Carl Durant.

237
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,760
Now, everyone knows everyone.

238
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,865
What you do not know is that a disaster is about to happen.

239
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,765
Sorry, when I sent for you,

240
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,399
you must have thought you would work with the sharks.

241
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:24,602
I never make assumptions,

242
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:28,010
but working with these sharks is a bad idea.

243
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:33,611
Yes, they are more dangerous than the usual laboratory rats,

244
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,813
but none of them will be hurt here.

245
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:37,779
That you can not guarantee it.

246
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,323
In fact, if.

247
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:46,092
Please all follow me upstairs, I have something to show you.

248
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:51,927
You have not been very polite.

249
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:54,866
- I was just telling the truth. - Well, go on.

250
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,475
It could serve us.

251
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:14,817
Be to make the presentation.

252
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:18,920
As said Mr. Durant, we have a security protocol that ...

253
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,432
Seriously?

254
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:28,300
- Swimming! - Somebody do something!

255
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,041
Hold on !

256
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,544
Oh, God, I do not see him!

257
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:40,608
Where is he ?

258
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,822
- Help ! - You're not going to do anything?

259
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,018
Did you see that ?

260
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,856
- Help ! - Stay calm.

261
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,330
Oh my God.

262
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:58,993
Oh my God.

263
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,305
- We just help you! - Quick !

264
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:04,140
- Oh my God. - It will be fine.

265
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,937
- It's not sure. - It will be fine.

266
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:10,678
You can do it ! Oh my God !

267
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,741
- Swim faster! - Oh my God !

268
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,013
Another five seconds.

269
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:15,415
- Do not look behind you! - Come on!

270
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:18,078
Come on!

271
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:21,622
- Come on! - Oh my God.

272
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,426
You're almost there.

273
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,963
- Come on! - You'll get there!

274
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:38,200
Oh my God.

275
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:42,107
- Thank you. - Thank you.

276
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,239
I should have increased.

277
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,875
Sorry, Aaron, I feel the drama,

278
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,385
but you were safe.

279
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:48,818
You find it funny?

280
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,455
I think it was an effective demonstration.

281
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,318
You train sharks Bulldogs. It's impossible.

282
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:58,193
Impossible ? Really ? After what you saw?

283
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:02,791
How would you have learned to swim training?

284
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:04,334
I'll explain later,

285
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:07,770
but first, put on dry clothes, put at ease

286
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,365
and end up in the lab in an hour.

287
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,813
I have not signed for.

288
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:20,352
- Calm down, I'll talk to him. - "Calm down"?

289
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,584
One of your shark bit my foot.

290
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,120
You imagine things.

291
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:29,194
Look at my fucking shoe.

292
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,730
She played with me

293
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,424
like I was a toy.

294
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:35,762
Sharks are not kidding.

295
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,962
You and I know that these are not normal sharks.

296
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:41,870
It's a good thing they dislike the taste of intellectuals.

297
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:47,373
It is this nerd who operates the complex.

298
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:26,694
Go.

299
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:39,207
We have a problem.

300
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:45,955
- What is the problem ? - Sharks are out this morning.

301
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:47,949
What?

302
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:50,552
They have dug a tunnel under the electric fence.

303
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,965
There was an accident. Trent believes they killed the fishermen.

304
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:57,761
He believes ?

305
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:01,730
He believes. That means he has not seen.

306
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:03,800
He was concerned enough to mention me.

307
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,774
Okay.

308
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:14,978
So the sharks have dug a tunnel under the electric fence

309
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:17,215
Trent and followed so far.

310
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:19,289
- Yes. - Exactly.

311
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,587
And you know why ?

312
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,487
Because they solve problems.

313
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:28,931
They learn to learn and they love it.

314
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:32,270
This means that the drugs work.

315
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:38,741
Every day, their genetic structure evolves. They become more intelligent.

316
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:41,642
If we learn that sharks have hurt someone,

317
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,305
we will be responsible.

318
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:44,940
It does not cost that bad publicity.

319
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:48,077
Sharks are alive because I permit them. It's simple.

320
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:52,420
I have created and when my search is over, I will kill them.

321
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,584
What do you mean ?

322
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,686
They tracers in their fins.

323
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:59,321
They can be found anywhere here

324
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:00,592
or at sea.

325
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:03,134
And when my experience is over,

326
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:05,968
I'll kill them, simply.

327
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:09,731
All. So do not worry about responsibility.

328
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:14,978
There will be no evidence.

329
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,801
How can you hungry now?

330
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:12,628
You know I eat when I'm nervous.

331
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,470
You have no regrets? After what makes Durant?

332
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:21,476
He is eccentric. But money is still there.

333
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:23,676
If you say so.

334
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:28,343
Sweetheart, look at me.

335
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,250
Look at me.

336
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,924
You will not regret it. I promise you.

337
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:39,921
Okay ?

338
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:46,534
There's something I have to tell you.

339
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:48,902
You'll find out anyway.

340
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:51,670
What is it ?

341
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:57,240
I worked with during the design molecules,

342
00:31:57,315 --> 00:32:00,752
to make them small to affect the faster DNA structure.

343
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:05,085
I also gave him access to some of your work.

344
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:09,256
I can not believe it. Since when ?

345
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:11,221
Seven months.

346
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:13,390
It's Landside months you lie to me?

347
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:15,763
No, I'm not lying. I have not told you, that's all.

348
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,369
Why did you do that ? I thought we were partners.

349
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,029
No, we're partners.

350
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,541
But I knew you hesitated because of the shady reputation of Durant.

351
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,008
So you decided to do it without me?

352
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,505
Just to see.

353
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:29,570
If it goes as planned, we will be rich.

354
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,773
I'm not turned me to science to get rich.

355
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:36,115
Yes, but with this money, we can do so much more.

356
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,951
No need to kneel to apply for grants.

357
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:48,457
Listen, if you do not go, we can go.

358
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,825
I think so.

359
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:55,635
It is already here.

360
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:58,366
Sorry.

361
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:01,577
Do me redo it, Daniel. I am not joking.

362
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,080
I must be able to trust you.

363
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,843
I promise you, okay?

364
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,646
We're a team. nothing more is we only hide.

365
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,474
- Stop complaining about you. - That was not cool.

366
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:38,243
- You're okay. - That was not cool.

367
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:43,321
Welcome, come on in.

368
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:48,117
I'm sure you're curious why I called you.

369
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,022
Not everybody.

370
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,031
You finally say.

371
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,791
- Yes. - Good.

372
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:01,339
I called you because I need your help.

373
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:04,069
I reached a crucial stage in my research.

374
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,411
Leslie, if I can call you Leslie?

375
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:11,172
You and your husband are studying traumatic brain injury.

376
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:13,012
Among other things.

377
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:15,747
- It includes intelligent substances. - The Nootropics.

378
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:20,782
My company is one of the largest producer of biopharmaceutical drugs,

379
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:23,157
- including ... - The performance optimizers.

380
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:27,862
You have been ratified by the World Anti-Doping Agency.

381
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:32,532
In this, performance optimizers, of nootropic.

382
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:34,629
You talk about substances like Adderall.

383
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:39,533
Nootropics can improve memory, increase concentration,

384
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,476
even speed up your decision making.

385
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,475
So simple stimulants?

386
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:47,182
That's it. Nothing can increase the intelligence with which we are born.

387
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,482
At least until now.

388
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:53,688
I developed components

389
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:57,889
that can actually altering the genetic structure of the brain.

390
00:34:58,062 --> 00:35:02,056
It accelerates the evolution towards greater intelligence.

391
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:03,465
Although larger.

392
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:10,440
And we deliver these components by means of target antibodies.

393
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:11,874
Sharks.

394
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:15,275
You test these substances on sharks?

395
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:19,250
It's inhumane.

396
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:22,377
It is not inhumane.

397
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:25,047
I will show you. Aaron.

398
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,758
Trent, we are ready for Bella.

399
00:35:58,289 --> 00:35:59,518
Okay, she's out.

400
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,486
They had.

401
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,921
Soft. Very good.

402
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:36,986
Mike, you got it?

403
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:39,826
You're not afraid to be so close?

404
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:41,727
Sharks do not scare me.

405
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:50,401
The vital data online.

406
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,170
breathing rate of 34-68.

407
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:56,009
heart rate 42 beats per minute.

408
00:36:57,081 --> 00:37:00,347
Oxygen levels are stable.

409
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:01,782
She looks fit.

410
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:08,390
As you can see, our treatment is completely painless.

411
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:13,288
If a drug binds to the molecular level of antibodies in sharks,

412
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:18,462
can be accessed with this substance in any area of ​​the brain.

413
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:23,497
We have already increased the intelligence of Bella per mile.

414
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:26,440
And you think you get the same results in humans?

415
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:30,207
I think it is an absolute necessity

416
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:34,343
if we want to maintain the supremacy of humanity.

417
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:41,858
Artificial intelligence gets stronger every year.

418
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:46,489
Soon, quantum computing an exponential acceleration start

419
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:50,831
the ability of our computers to learn by themselves

420
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:54,668
and when that happens, they will escape our control

421
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:57,800
and our world, in the blink of ?? it.

422
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:02,445
The man himself ...

423
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,841
become obsolete.

424
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:12,017
And they will destroy us.

425
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,591
But there is another way.

426
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:22,499
The human brain has a hundred billion neurons.

427
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,195
Our potential is greater than any machine.

428
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:30,968
Just release it.

429
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:34,010
So you are the savior of the human race?

430
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,039
You think you are God.

431
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,886
When I succeed,

432
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,221
we will all be gods.

433
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:48,052
Or monsters.

434
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,131
It was mostly your search

435
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:04,505
that helped me to go in the right direction.

436
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,550
Your boss is always so passionate?

437
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:21,215
He has just started to take the new substance.

438
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:24,821
It seems to excite a little. It's not really a secret.

439
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,492
It administers the substance itself? It's insane.

440
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:31,968
This guy has built an empire of a billion dollars out of nothing.

441
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,005
He's a genius.

442
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,473
Who am I to tell him what to do?

443
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:42,975
Have you noticed any negative side effects

444
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,573
in sharks with these so-called miracles substances?

445
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:47,447
I would not say they are negative.

446
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:48,747
His view seems to have improved

447
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:51,516
and it looks like she can communicate with the other sharks.

448
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:55,224
- You laugh. - No.

449
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:03,391
So what happens?

450
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,716
I do not understand why you brought me.

451
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,453
What do you expect me exactly?

452
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:33,058
Bella unusual behavior recently

453
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:36,862
that does not seem related to its increased intelligence.

454
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:40,164
I was hoping you could tell us why.

455
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:43,772
She is pregnant.

456
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:47,336
What?

457
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:49,803
It's impossible.

458
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,438
I give him blood samples every week.

459
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,208
We would know if she was knocked up.

460
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,650
You did an ultrasound?

461
00:40:57,488 --> 00:40:59,582
I swim with sharks since I was 7 years old.

462
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:01,455
I recognize a shark "knocked up" when I see one.

463
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:04,524
Why is not reflected in her hormones?

464
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:08,988
You said that the substance alter his DNA.

465
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,135
- It's possible. - Trent?

466
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,303
POWER FAILURE

467
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,473
What is happening ?

468
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,458
Maybe you are right.

469
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:37,927
I should have realize.

470
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:42,128
Maybe you were too busy to congratulate yourself.

471
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:45,798
It's possible.

472
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,241
The genoa is damaged. The boat touched.

473
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,206
In addition, hundreds of liters of fuel

474
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:02,507
were dumped into the lagoon.

475
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,570
Whore.

476
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:14,589
What's going on if the fuel touches the electrified fence?

477
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:17,727
We oxygen tanks stored in the cabin under water.

478
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:19,954
I know.

479
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,386
We should take a swab of the throat.

480
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,719
Damn! It was supposed to sleep for another hour!

481
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:25,285
- You okay?
- Is Bella okay?

482
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:27,057
- Yes she is fine. - Are you sure ?

483
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:30,829
Yes ! And I also thank you for asking.

484
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,102
What was that ?

485
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:45,507
Mr. Durant had a very inconsistent behavior

486
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:47,380
and took questionable decisions

487
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:49,852
since it takes nootropic.

488
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,189
I repeated several times that ...

489
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,106
BROKEN ELEVATOR

490
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:12,700
EMERGENCY LIGHTING ON

491
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,673
Oh my God ! What is happening ?

492
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:19,582
- What was that ? - I dunno.

493
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:21,777
Oh my God.

494
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:23,913
What is happening ?

495
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,046
FAILURE SCOPE

496
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:32,256
- While the barrier is lowered? - Just part.

497
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:34,530
- How are you, "in part"? - I can fix that.

498
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:37,227
- It was a blast? - There's a fire.

499
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:40,330
- This is Bella? - Yes, it is red.

500
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:43,504
It happens that it separates from the other ...

501
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,634
Non, Dr Calhoun.

502
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:00,750
What...

503
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:03,950
There is someone ?

504
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:13,226
OFFLINE

505
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:19,570
No ! It's not possible !

506
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:21,077
She turned off the cameras.

507
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:22,306
It is capable of?

508
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:37,425
Shit, then.

509
00:46:58,215 --> 00:47:00,650
Whore ! The protection of the hull was cracked!

510
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:02,715
Release the pressure to not lose that basin.

511
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:03,981
Including.

512
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,428
This corridor is flooded!

513
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:14,887
It does not smell good.

514
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,199
What is it ?

515
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:37,552
Did you see that ? These sharks have carved Craig parts.

516
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,086
I have never seen such a shark bite before.

517
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,019
We will all die, right?

518
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:45,358
No. Everybody calm down. Aaron, one is where?

519
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:47,155
It does not smell good at all.

520
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:49,996
Aaron! Tell me where we are? There are several gaps?

521
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,762
Only the corridor is.

522
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:52,825
For the moment.

523
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,232
Do not say "for now". Why do you say that ?

524
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:57,498
I've never seen them behave like that.

525
00:47:58,742 --> 00:47:59,835
They are very restless.

526
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:03,280
Tell me "agitated," it's not that bad.

527
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:05,009
They're hunting.

528
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,017
This is completely crazy.

529
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:08,415
That's why they will not?

530
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:11,214
Even if the barrier is lowered? They stay to eat us?

531
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:15,155
Wait a minute. That does not make any sense.

532
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,694
If all sharks were out in the lagoon,

533
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:20,028
who did this to Craig?

534
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:29,901
I know I told you to never save my search in the cloud

535
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:31,066
but now you have to.

536
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:32,265
I can not.

537
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,846
Even if I wanted to, the system does not respond.

538
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:38,946
Oh my God.

539
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:49,886
- I just got it. - Understand what ?

540
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,455
What is happening ?

541
00:48:57,801 --> 00:48:58,962
Say it to us.

542
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:02,805
- Bella is not pregnant. - What?

543
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,533
She put down.

544
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:08,905
When it was released in the basin, the work had begun.

545
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:14,282
Whatever've created here, Durant is nasty.

546
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,753
These are not ordinary sharks.

547
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:21,521
It is a mass of teeth, muscles and killer instinct.

548
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:24,888
It's the only thing that can explain what happened to Craig.

549
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,159
You talk as if it were a band of super piranhas.

550
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:30,494
They are worse.

551
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:33,263
Much worse.

552
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,948
Diving bottles ...

553
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:49,911
- Look at me. - One can use it.

554
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,649
- Daniel, look at me! - Yeah.

555
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,092
Breathe, honey, breathe.

556
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:04,662
- I love you. - I love you too.

557
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:08,637
On s'en it out.

558
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:11,002
- Yes. - Yes.

559
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:15,002
Go.

560
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,754
You might stop moving in all directions?

561
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:27,052
It is useless to lose control.

562
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,183
It is not you who said that your security system was infallible?

563
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,888
Yes, it should have been.

564
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:35,524
Obviously, my job was even more successful than I thought.

565
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,696
If that's successful, I would like to see a failure.

566
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:44,000
- You have to climb. - I agree.

567
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:46,534
There's just one problem.

568
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:49,041
All outputs are submerged.

569
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,112
They may not know for the hole in the fence.

570
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:56,312
They know it is there, it is they who created it.

571
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,287
So why they do not go? Misty?

572
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:02,455
- They want something here. - Yes No !

573
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,329
You want to know why chimpanzees are so dangerous?

574
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:09,025
Because they are smart enough to want revenge. Like humans.

575
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,731
It's lovely ? Yes, it must be that.

576
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:15,930
Bella is not only smart, it is also bad and wants our skin.

577
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:19,136
The others are only soldiers who will do what she wants.

578
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:21,235
We're all screwed!

579
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:23,576
No time for theories or panic attacks.

580
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:24,774
We must find a way out of here.

581
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,312
If we could move a call on ...

582
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:28,477
Genus, a satellite phone?

583
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:30,180
It only walking surface.

584
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:33,155
Still a trade secret of our fanatic fearless leader

585
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:35,658
which puts everyone in danger because he's crazy!

586
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:38,124
- You said what ? - I said, "Fuck you!"

587
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:41,391
You will do what fire me? I resign !

588
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:44,495
How do you get out if there is no exit?

589
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:46,767
There is another way.

590
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:48,337
You think about what I think?

591
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:51,101
- The catchment. - Hold on.

592
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:53,399
You want to escape by swimming?

593
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:54,809
It's impossible, man.

594
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:56,506
I am not calling a foot in the water with the sharks.

595
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,208
Non, point final.

596
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,046
No, Daniel and I do not like too much the idea either.

597
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:04,452
You do not need to swim.

598
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:06,752
So we'll do what, teleport?

599
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:11,091
Mike may cause the diver propulsion vehicle in the central platform,

600
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:14,760
call the Coast Guard of the surface.

601
00:52:15,232 --> 00:52:18,396
- There is help. - Yes, help, it says me.

602
00:52:19,002 --> 00:52:21,699
Yes, you may have forgotten the baby sharks.

603
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:23,262
A little important detail.

604
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,740
They had come with the breach of the hull.

605
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,936
They found room, so they'll stay there,

606
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:28,239
at least for a while.

607
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:33,242
Okay, that's a good plan, I'm going.

608
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,114
No. We need you here.

609
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:36,613
No, I'm going.

610
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:41,358
- Out of the question. - I go.

611
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:42,824
No, it's too dangerous and that's my job.

612
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:44,259
I go, whether you like it or not.

613
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,488
No need that you risk your life.

614
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:46,621
It is for me to judge.

615
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:48,255
We can not afford all die.

616
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:51,799
In addition, I am South African, I love stories like this.

617
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:54,463
These sharks can go fuck himself.

618
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:56,901
Attends, Mike !

619
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,978
- Mike! - Let's go.

620
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,279
Someone saw?

621
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,183
- Where did he go ? - Someone saw?

622
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,710
Non.

623
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,653
- He's there. - I see him.

624
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:15,555
- You think it will happen? - Yes.

625
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:18,558
- Oh, shit, there's a shark. - Mike!

626
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:19,754
Mike, behind you!

627
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:25,934
Oh my God !

628
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,166
- Oh no ! Mike! - He is dead ?

629
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:31,333
- He's not moving. - It's fucked.

630
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:33,468
It's not possible.

631
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,034
Non...

632
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:39,605
Oh my God.

633
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:41,880
Oh my God !

634
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:51,022
Come on, Trent.

635
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:56,891
- He got it. - It will be fine.

636
00:53:57,968 --> 00:53:59,732
It happens in the basin.

637
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:05,374
Come on!

638
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:07,937
- I will not see - Where are they?

639
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,545
Raise them!

640
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:17,276
Go.

641
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:22,556
Let it breathe.

642
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:37,268
Come on, Mike.

643
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,204
Come on, Mike!

644
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:46,279
Shit !

645
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:51,847
Come on!

646
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:56,591
Its good !

647
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,095
What happened ?

648
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:04,294
You got knocked by a shark.

649
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:05,895
You were dead, man.

650
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,870
I should have come and watch your back.

651
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:13,602
I told you. These sharks can go fuck himself.

652
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:29,659
We have other weapons?

653
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:34,058
Of spear guns, of strychnine nitrate?

654
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:36,291
Okay, everybody calm.

655
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:38,062
I flares on the boat.

656
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:39,534
You do not want to do that?

657
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:43,232
You spent your whole life to protect sharks.

658
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:49,979
I help people to see that sharks are not monsters.

659
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:51,309
But your sharks?

660
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:54,640
You've turned into monsters.

661
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:59,846
We can not let the sharks leave the complex.

662
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:01,949
We can not let them mate.

663
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,722
We can not let them hurt more people.

664
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,793
We must kill these damn shark!

665
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,457
Okay, but you do not know

666
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:12,627
they open the doors to incredible research.

667
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:17,572
I'm on the verge of making a breakthrough

668
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,132
that will change the course of history.

669
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,805
Excuse me, but you should explain to Mike.

670
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,643
Oh, no, wait, you can not.

671
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,377
You'd like to know why ? Because a shark tore off his head!

672
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:35,189
Pressure control is lost.

673
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:36,687
What does it mean ?

674
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,694
It means that everything will explode!

675
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:07,686
Leslie !

676
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,967
Shoot. Go.

677
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,428
Come on!

678
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:25,404
- There is too much water! - Help me, do not give up!

679
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:26,909
Shoot!

680
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:32,481
Its good !

681
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:34,245
- It's okay ? - Yes. And you ?

682
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:36,877
Yes.

683
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:45,892
The various sections of this complex communicate with each other?

684
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:48,924
You want to know if the baby sharks are locked in the corridor is.

685
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:50,660
It would be nice if they were.

686
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:55,301
- No. They can be anywhere. - Oh fuck.

687
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:01,636
How could you get to work for this guy?

688
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:04,175
It's crazy.

689
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,382
Only since he started taking the substance.

690
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:10,620
It was already a bastard, but not to this extent.

691
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:13,689
I should have quit months ago.

692
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:17,660
So what are you still doing here?

693
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,195
And you, what are you doing here?

694
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,345
You know where we're going?

695
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:46,849
There is a way out?

696
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:50,517
Hopefully this is not overwhelmed.

697
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:53,527
Yes, hopefully.

698
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,053
Leslie !

699
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:26,124
"Go to Cape Town," they said. "It will be nice," they said!

700
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:29,097
Shut up. Remind me why we're going in the crew quarters.

701
00:59:29,165 --> 00:59:31,031
This is what is farthest from the corridor is.

702
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,365
Yes, I understand, but we should not get the others?

703
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:35,769
Dude, Bella babies are on the lookout.

704
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:37,238
We have to get water.

705
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:39,867
I know, but my instinct whispered that unity is strength.

706
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:42,378
Ah yes ? Well mine told me that we should get out of here.

707
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:46,011
Listen, Aaron. Do not make me do this alone.

708
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,607
Come on, man.

709
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:51,779
Okay, but you better not Thee planted.

710
00:59:51,854 --> 00:59:52,947
Over there.

711
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:09,230
Leslie !

712
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:19,948
Everything will be alright.

713
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:23,344
How can you be so optimistic now?

714
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:25,217
I cling to hope.

715
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,416
It's a little desperate, but I cling.

716
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,322
This is the crew quarters. It will be safe.

717
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:34,522
I think we must find a way out of there.

718
01:00:34,597 --> 01:00:36,190
It is itinerant fish food.

719
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:39,258
We must move away from sharks and wait until help arrives.

720
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:41,133
Yes, and if they never arrive, Josh?

721
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:43,064
Bravo for hope.

722
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:48,670
In fact, if I want more to find me a job, ignores me.

723
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:51,440
Dude, you were living in the basement of your mother.

724
01:00:53,516 --> 01:00:54,882
Go.

725
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:08,889
Hey ! Where are the others ?

726
01:02:11,527 --> 01:02:15,521
I saw one. Everyone had to flee by different outputs.

727
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:18,932
- You're afraid, Durant? - It would be crazy not to be.

728
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:23,506
It's less fun when it's rabbit holding the gun, right?

729
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:25,369
If we focused on running away from here?

730
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:27,640
How? It is blocked.

731
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:30,378
If it reaches the filter room,

732
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:32,675
we should be able to go through the vents.

733
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:33,876
Comment ?

734
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:37,219
They put bars access for easy maintenance.

735
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:39,281
Okay, I did not know that.

736
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:43,288
- Luckily, I'm here, right? - We must find the others.

737
01:02:43,626 --> 01:02:45,390
I know they will be found,

738
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:47,327
but one must first reach the surface and call for help.

739
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:49,991
If there is another gap, everything will end up overwhelmed.

740
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,432
Trent is right.

741
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:56,539
During agrees with me? It gives me the creeps.

742
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:00,200
- He is right ? - I dunno.

743
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:03,211
This is the best option we have. Come on, move.

744
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:14,747
Leslie! You hear me ?

745
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:22,194
Leslie, where are you?

746
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:31,833
Shit !

747
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,606
The filtration room is over there.

748
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:07,066
Shut that door.

749
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:15,340
Go. Shit, Aaron, I told you to fix the fucking door.

750
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:18,404
Yes, it's not as if I had not been occupied in the last 24 hours.

751
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:23,716
You heard that?

752
01:05:29,792 --> 01:05:30,885
Oh my God.

753
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,019
Why do you say that ?

754
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:34,290
- Get away from the door, Josh! - Shit !

755
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:43,134
Dude, breaks away from there.

756
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,769
Are you kidding me !

757
01:05:49,912 --> 01:05:52,313
Josh !

758
01:05:54,984 --> 01:05:56,782
I want to die like that.

759
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:21,007
Oh my God.

760
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:28,480
Non ! Aaron ! Non !

761
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:31,916
Josh ?

762
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:33,311
Aaron !

763
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:35,351
Josh !

764
01:07:09,725 --> 01:07:10,920
When we get out of here,

765
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:13,155
I will ensure that you are held responsible.

766
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:15,755
This is also what I want, but it is I who will go.

767
01:07:15,831 --> 01:07:17,766
You signed a nondisclosure clause.

768
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:19,768
Yes, good luck to find her.

769
01:07:19,835 --> 01:07:21,167
Your legal counsel is dead.

770
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:23,967
So you want the end of humanity

771
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:26,269
so you can save what matters to you.

772
01:07:26,342 --> 01:07:29,210
We're not so different, we just gives value to different species.

773
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:31,314
It is very different, the opposite.

774
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:35,078
Well, if you do not stop arguing, I pound shark.

775
01:07:43,592 --> 01:07:44,924
Leslie ?

776
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:48,725
Daniel ?

777
01:07:49,365 --> 01:07:50,355
Leslie ?

778
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,033
Daniel ?

779
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:02,700
Daniel !

780
01:08:03,212 --> 01:08:04,578
You're in this pump?

781
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:07,010
Yes.

782
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:21,490
Daniel !

783
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:42,649
What are you doing ?

784
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:48,281
What are you doing? Are you crazy ?

785
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:50,991
You have lost your mind?

786
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:53,858
Let's leave this place.

787
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:56,861
You sign his death warrant.

788
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,128
These baby sharks will not reach us.

789
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:02,771
I should have killed you.

790
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:07,542
But you'll do it not because you're not a killer.

791
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:11,939
In addition, if it returns to the surface in time, maybe you can still save her.

792
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:13,606
That should motivate you.

793
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:29,890
It's blocked ! During condemned the door.

794
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,867
Back to the surface! Calls for help!

795
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,661
I am getting up.

796
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:37,705
Try to find another way out, but I was.

797
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:40,806
I come again.

798
01:10:19,748 --> 01:10:20,943
Where are you going ?

799
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:28,350
You're not very loyal.

800
01:10:28,424 --> 01:10:29,722
Farms.

801
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:34,326
This girl, I understand. It's a fanatic.

802
01:10:35,164 --> 01:10:36,894
But you're here for a while,

803
01:10:37,032 --> 01:10:39,627
you saw what I accomplished in record time.

804
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:41,396
You contributed.

805
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:44,540
The answer is before our eyes.

806
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:50,375
so we can achieve more capacity in our brains.

807
01:10:50,446 --> 01:10:52,347
I did it, I felt it!

808
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:55,881
I just need a little more time to make it to last ...

809
01:10:55,951 --> 01:10:57,749
You are desperate to the project!

810
01:10:58,387 --> 01:11:00,754
I like you higher in the military.

811
01:11:00,956 --> 01:11:03,687
The soldiers were just pawns on a chessboard.

812
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:05,387
That's why I broke.

813
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:07,623
It will take rerentrer there, because a war is brewing.

814
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:10,392
- There is no war. - The man against the machine!

815
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:15,493
You may as machines, robots and computers are destroying us.

816
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:16,869
From what I could see,

817
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:19,534
it is the man the real threat and the real problem.

818
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:22,635
You're lost you, Trent.

819
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:24,212
You disappoint me.

820
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,806
So it's a good thing I do not care what you think.

821
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:46,730
Daniel ?

822
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:51,501
Where are you ?

823
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:15,320
Daniel !

824
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:34,672
Leslie.

825
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:38,854
Non.

826
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:43,585
Not by one! No !

827
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:46,561
Come back !

828
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:55,397
Leslie! It's me ! Come !

829
01:12:57,272 --> 01:12:58,262
Leslie !

830
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:02,208
Daniel !

831
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:06,939
Get out of the water!

832
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:13,554
Daniel! Oh my God !

833
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:17,191
Help me, Daniel!

834
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:18,850
Not touch it!

835
01:13:18,927 --> 01:13:20,862
Daniel! Oh my God !

836
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:34,407
Leslie !

837
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:49,555
Non !

838
01:14:41,276 --> 01:14:42,266
Shit.

839
01:15:15,878 --> 01:15:17,346
SATELLITE PHONE

840
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:26,879
Mayday. Coast Guard, the research center here Akheilos,

841
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:28,787
requesting an emergency evacuation.

842
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:32,419
We take water, is without power and there is a fire.

843
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:34,122
It has undergone major structural damage.

844
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:35,596
emergency evacuation request.

845
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:37,963
Repeat, emergency evacuation request.

846
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:03,992
I'm an ace of survival.

847
01:16:04,526 --> 01:16:06,688
Now I have to reach that pipe.

848
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:14,926
No ! Crap!

849
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:21,537
Shit !

850
01:16:35,557 --> 01:16:36,718
Daniel !

851
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:41,457
Leslie ... She ...

852
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:45,659
I'm sorry, man.

853
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:49,303
I really am. But then, we must continue to advance, right?

854
01:16:49,638 --> 01:16:50,867
Why ?

855
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:54,140
Let go of me.

856
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:56,076
I will not leave you here.

857
01:16:56,411 --> 01:16:57,743
Let me die.

858
01:16:57,946 --> 01:17:01,144
Shake yourself, Daniel. I can not do this alone.

859
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:03,115
Leslie does not want you lower the arms.

860
01:17:03,518 --> 01:17:04,713
Non.

861
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:06,220
She wants you continue to fight.

862
01:17:07,155 --> 01:17:11,115
I barely knew, but I know she loved you.

863
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:13,492
She wanted you to live.

864
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:19,332
Do it for her. Hold on to life.

865
01:17:19,935 --> 01:17:21,062
Do it for her.

866
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:22,830
I have to live for it.

867
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:24,940
Do it for her. You can do it.

868
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:28,002
I can get.

869
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:32,444
Yes. Go.

870
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:46,687
Misty ?

871
01:17:47,195 --> 01:17:49,255
- Misty! - Oh my God ! You are alive!

872
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:51,122
You are alive!

873
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:53,692
Where are the others ?

874
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:57,166
They do not survive.

875
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:02,500
I'm sorry.

876
01:18:04,813 --> 01:18:06,042
I have to live for it.

877
01:18:06,648 --> 01:18:07,980
Tell me there's a way out.

878
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:10,986
Yes, there is a vent behind the door.

879
01:18:11,319 --> 01:18:13,311
Trent must be on the surface to call for help.

880
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:14,751
Thank God.

881
01:18:15,157 --> 01:18:16,853
And we are waiting for? Lets' go !

882
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:18,187
- Help me open this door. - Yes.

883
01:18:18,326 --> 01:18:19,726
PULL !

884
01:18:22,297 --> 01:18:23,287
Its good.

885
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:24,856
Stop!

886
01:18:24,933 --> 01:18:25,992
What's the matter ?

887
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:30,228
We are not alone. Go!

888
01:18:30,305 --> 01:18:32,365
- What about you ? - I follow you. Come on!

889
01:18:38,346 --> 01:18:39,712
Great advice.

890
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:43,511
Go.

891
01:18:53,862 --> 01:18:55,160
Shit !

892
01:18:57,933 --> 01:19:01,131
Come on!

893
01:19:01,203 --> 01:19:05,163
Shit ! Guys, go away!

894
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:15,240
Go. We are almost there.

895
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:16,645
A bar at a time.

896
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:24,458
Oh shit.

897
01:19:28,463 --> 01:19:30,056
A bar at a time.

898
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:33,765
Shit.

899
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:36,965
- Aaron, the water is rising! - Yes.

900
01:19:39,674 --> 01:19:42,542
Give me the key.

901
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:45,377
The key.

902
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:47,639
What? No.

903
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:51,186
Give me the key.

904
01:19:51,486 --> 01:19:52,545
Non.

905
01:19:52,721 --> 01:19:55,657
My work is too important to entrust a hothead in your type.

906
01:19:55,724 --> 01:19:56,714
Give me the damn key

907
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:59,057
or I swear I'll tear the hands

908
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:00,652
and I'll throw you to the sharks then.

909
01:20:04,499 --> 01:20:05,865
Feeling brave?

910
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:08,197
So jump.

911
01:20:22,517 --> 01:20:23,576
Hold.

912
01:20:25,353 --> 01:20:26,480
Come on!

913
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:29,018
I leave and get the others.

914
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:32,455
Do not be stupid, they all died.

915
01:20:32,527 --> 01:20:33,722
We are almost there.

916
01:20:33,795 --> 01:20:34,990
Aaron !

917
01:20:35,163 --> 01:20:37,257
- Keep on going ! - Aaron! I will your.

918
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:38,493
Come on!

919
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:44,833
- Come on, it's good. - Trent.

920
01:20:45,307 --> 01:20:46,297
You're with others?

921
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:47,706
- Daniel. - Go.

922
01:20:47,776 --> 01:20:49,802
- Daniel is below. - Go.

923
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:57,178
Shit.

924
01:21:07,996 --> 01:21:09,225
Damn, he's dead.

925
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:14,696
Whore !

926
01:22:00,148 --> 01:22:01,548
Look.

927
01:22:07,055 --> 01:22:08,318
Shit, this is Misty.

928
01:22:11,693 --> 01:22:12,956
Misty !

929
01:22:14,963 --> 01:22:16,261
Come on, Misty!

930
01:22:18,066 --> 01:22:19,898
Do not look back, continues!

931
01:22:19,968 --> 01:22:21,129
Misty! Come on! Swim!

932
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:24,266
Come on! Faster !

933
01:22:26,741 --> 01:22:27,970
Come on, Misty!

934
01:22:28,810 --> 01:22:30,938
Go.

935
01:22:31,346 --> 01:22:32,746
Go.

936
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:38,245
How did you ...

937
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,583
I went through the basin.

938
01:22:43,925 --> 01:22:45,826
You have abandoned me to certain death!

939
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:47,896
I should throw you in the water, bastard!

940
01:22:48,263 --> 01:22:49,458
Let me go.

941
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:51,261
Its good. We will be time for that later.

942
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:01,537
Aaron, where is Daniel?

943
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,173
He did not survive.

944
01:23:11,386 --> 01:23:12,513
You are a demon.

945
01:23:13,188 --> 01:23:15,020
- I am a demon ? - Yes.

946
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:18,122
Copernicus, Galileo, Darwin,

947
01:23:18,193 --> 01:23:22,756
at a time, each visionary scientist was seen as harmful.

948
01:23:22,931 --> 01:23:24,957
- Cash psychopath ... - Psychopath?

949
01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:27,696
- Yes, you are a psychopath. - Do not approach.

950
01:23:29,037 --> 01:23:32,166
- You are a psycho. - Do not approach!

951
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,367
The Coast Guard!

952
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:36,470
They had to send a drone to see if it was a real call.

953
01:23:37,345 --> 01:23:39,177
- We are here ! - Hey!

954
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:42,149
- We are here ! - Right here !

955
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:45,711
- We are here ! - We are here ! Hey !

956
01:23:51,659 --> 01:23:53,127
Why not you leave us alone?

957
01:23:53,395 --> 01:23:56,194
Just a little alone!

958
01:23:56,364 --> 01:23:58,356
My sharks are amazing.

959
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:01,162
Perhaps they will put it on your tombstone.

960
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:06,164
What was that ?

961
01:24:06,341 --> 01:24:08,105
The bridge is taking water.

962
01:24:08,176 --> 01:24:09,405
It means...

963
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:13,409
It means that this bridge will be submerged in a few minutes.

964
01:24:14,349 --> 01:24:15,373
It is dead.

965
01:24:19,087 --> 01:24:23,286
No. Look. We must swim to the boat.

966
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:26,686
There are still sharks. There is little chance of survival.

967
01:24:26,761 --> 01:24:27,990
Maybe they left.

968
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:30,396
It is perhaps still eating the drone.

969
01:24:30,465 --> 01:24:32,400
No way. We expect the Coast Guard.

970
01:24:32,467 --> 01:24:34,595
By the time the Coast Guard arrives, we'll all be dead.

971
01:24:38,606 --> 01:24:40,370
- Hurry up. - Yes he is right.

972
01:24:40,475 --> 01:24:42,944
I not go back in the water with the sharks. Forget that.

973
01:24:43,011 --> 01:24:44,138
You can do it.

974
01:24:44,212 --> 01:24:45,840
No, there must be another way.

975
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:47,644
If you have a better idea, I'd love to hear it.

976
01:24:47,715 --> 01:24:49,183
Well, it's for your own good.

977
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:54,782
- Feels good, right? - The farm.

978
01:24:55,023 --> 01:24:56,491
Lets' go.

979
01:25:27,522 --> 01:25:29,957
- Aaron !
- Aaron !

980
01:25:33,394 --> 01:25:34,487
Oh, no.

981
01:25:47,242 --> 01:25:48,266
Bella.

982
01:26:00,121 --> 01:26:02,955
I told you I was the master of Bella!

983
01:26:37,292 --> 01:26:38,385
Where is Bella!

984
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:42,654
I not see it. Neither she nor Aaron.

985
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:46,357
- Shit ! I should not have the push! - Do not inflict it.

986
01:26:47,001 --> 01:26:48,230
You were trying to save him.

987
01:26:50,605 --> 01:26:53,165
She came back !

988
01:26:54,742 --> 01:26:56,540
Come on! Started !

989
01:26:57,378 --> 01:26:59,540
Trent, it will put the parts in the boat!

990
01:27:02,483 --> 01:27:03,678
Started !

991
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:34,244
Right in the target.

992
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:01,303
I thought you were dead!

993
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:04,443
Yes me too.

994
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,914
He led me to the back, but then he let me go.

995
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:11,282
I used it to hold on to its tail.

996
01:28:11,819 --> 01:28:13,651
I told you they did not like the taste of intellectuals.

997
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:15,757
Yes, it just a fetish for my shoes.

998
01:28:16,724 --> 01:28:18,625
Go. Let's leave this place.

999
01:28:29,837 --> 01:28:31,738
Wait a second.

1000
01:28:31,839 --> 01:28:33,307
No. We can not just go home?

1001
01:28:33,775 --> 01:28:35,300
We can not let these sharks alive.

1002
01:28:37,478 --> 01:28:38,673
Trent.

1003
01:28:41,683 --> 01:28:42,844
Hold on.

1004
01:28:48,589 --> 01:28:49,613
What's this ?

1005
01:28:50,792 --> 01:28:52,317
You remember what Aaron said?

1006
01:28:52,794 --> 01:28:56,287
About During holding at all costs to keep its secrets?

1007
01:28:58,599 --> 01:28:59,794
It was true.

1008
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:10,644
Impossible.

1009
01:29:11,012 --> 01:29:12,503
It's a joke.

1010
01:29:13,014 --> 01:29:14,312
I am not joking.

1011
01:29:37,171 --> 01:29:38,867
It's like in the movies.

1012
01:29:39,741 --> 01:29:42,836
Yeah, like in the movies.

1013
01:29:43,511 --> 01:29:45,639
My last job was lame,

1014
01:29:47,648 --> 01:29:48,946
but at least we had not tried to eat me.

1015
01:29:50,418 --> 01:29:52,284
I returned to live in Silicon Valley.

1016
01:29:55,423 --> 01:29:58,222
Go. We are out of here.

1017
01:30:03,865 --> 01:30:05,857
3 WEEKS LATER

1018
01:30:22,283 --> 01:30:23,581
Lets' go.

1019
01:30:23,718 --> 01:30:25,243
I will not go too far.

1020
01:30:26,954 --> 01:30:28,923
And if there were sharks?

1021
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:31,589
There are no sharks on this beach. I promise.

1022
01:33:47,688 --> 01:33:49,680


1023
01:33:51,892 --> 01:33:52,882
