1
00:00:59,087 --> 00:01:01,588
MARCIA?

2
00:01:01,589 --> 00:01:06,093
MARCIA, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

3
00:01:06,094 --> 00:01:10,597
MARCIA.

4
00:01:10,598 --> 00:01:16,103
I'LL TAKE HER.

5
00:02:13,665 --> 00:02:18,169
UH, A BRONX CABBIE WAS ROBBED
AND STRANGLED WITH A G-STRING

6
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:22,173
BY TWO TWIN SISTERS
WHO WERE TOPLESS DANCERS.

7
00:02:26,678 --> 00:02:28,179
IF THEY WERE TWINS,
THERE COULD ONLY

8
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,180
HAVE BEEN TWO OF THEM, DOCTOR.

9
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:32,184
AND HE'S OFF AGAIN.

10
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:36,688
UH, THREE PEOPLE KILLED
BY A GUNMAN IN A SUBWAY CAR.

11
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,190
WE ARE LIKE RATS IN A MAZE,
SCURRYING AROUND,

12
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:41,193
DEVOURING EACH OTHER.

13
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,695
IT'S A VIOLENT WORLD OUT THERE.

14
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,697
DOCTOR, DID YOU BUY
ANOTHER PAPER

15
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:46,698
WITH ONLY BAD NEWS IN IT?

16
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,700
GOOD NEWS IS NO NEWS.

17
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:51,204
JESUS, WOULD YOU SHUT UP?

18
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:55,208
WHAT YOU TALKING TO HIM FOR?
CONCENTRATE ON YOUR NEXT MOVE.

19
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:56,709
HURRY UP, OLGA, SHE'LL GET THERE
BEFORE WE DO.

20
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,711
MARCIA, WOULD YOU
PLEASE SLOW DOWN?

21
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:02,215
I CAN'T HAVE MY STUDENTS SEE ME
BOLTING ACROSS CAMPUS

22
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:04,217
LIKE A HYPERACTIVE CLYDESDALE.

23
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:07,220
OH, GOD FORBID.

24
00:03:13,728 --> 00:03:14,728
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

25
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:15,729
I'M IMPOSING
A TWO-MINUTE TIME LIMIT.

26
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,731
STARTING NOW.

27
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:19,733
NO TIME LIMIT.
WE AGREED.

28
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:21,235
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
YOU SUFFERED FROM ADD.

29
00:03:21,236 --> 00:03:25,239
UH, A WOMAN IN THE BRONX
WAS LOCKED IN A CLOSET

30
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,743
FOR THREE DAYS FOR STARCHING
HER HUSBAND'S UNDERWEAR.

31
00:03:28,744 --> 00:03:29,744
YOU MADE THAT ONE UP.

32
00:03:29,745 --> 00:03:30,745
IT'S RIGHT HERE.

33
00:03:30,746 --> 00:03:33,248
GOOD EVENING, GENTLEMEN.

34
00:03:33,249 --> 00:03:35,750
HELLO, MARCIA, OLGA.

35
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:37,752
DAVID, GARY.

36
00:03:37,753 --> 00:03:40,255
GREAT, ANOTHER DISTRACTION.

37
00:03:40,256 --> 00:03:45,260
OH THANK YOU, MR. SOKOL.
IT'S LOVELY TO SEE YOU TOO.

38
00:03:45,261 --> 00:03:47,763
OH, DR. CHEBRIN, YOU CAME.

39
00:03:47,764 --> 00:03:49,765
OF COURSE, DARLING.

40
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:52,768
ALL I HAVE TO DO EVENINGS
IS READ MY PAPER, GROW OLDER--

41
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:55,271
AND FOLLOW HOMICIDE DETECTIVES
AROUND TOWN

42
00:03:55,272 --> 00:03:57,273
FOR LATE BREAKING ATROCITIES.

43
00:03:57,274 --> 00:03:59,275
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL CAKE, MARCIA.

44
00:03:59,276 --> 00:04:00,776
IS IRENE COMING SOON?

45
00:04:00,777 --> 00:04:03,279
YES, SHE HAS A CLASS UNTIL 6:00.

46
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,780
MY GOD, MARCIA,
NOT A MOMENT TO SPARE.

47
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:06,282
I TOLD YOU WE SHOULD
HAVE STARTED SOONER.

48
00:04:06,283 --> 00:04:07,670
HEY, HEY, GENTLEMEN,
WE'RE PRESSED FOR TIME HERE.

49
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:08,285
CHECKMATE.

50
00:04:08,286 --> 00:04:09,286
NO!

51
00:04:09,287 --> 00:04:10,287
NO, DON'T.

52
00:04:10,288 --> 00:04:12,289
THANK YOU.

53
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,291
I'VE BEEN BEHIND SCHEDULE SINCE
MY LECTURE CLASS THIS MORNING.

54
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:16,793
THE QUESTION AND ANSWER
WAS INTERMINABLE.

55
00:04:16,794 --> 00:04:18,795
THEY'RE TRYING TO FATHOM
YOUR PROFUNDITIES.

56
00:04:18,796 --> 00:04:21,798
PLEASE-- THE GIRLS WERE
MENTALLY FILING THEIR NAILS,

57
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:24,301
WHILE THE BOYS WERE DECIDING
WHO IN CLASS

58
00:04:24,302 --> 00:04:27,305
IS THE WORTHIEST RECIPIENT
OF THEIR NEXT ERECTION.

59
00:04:27,306 --> 00:04:29,307
NO ONE LISTENS ANYMORE.

60
00:04:29,308 --> 00:04:30,808
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
THERE'S A LONG WAITLIST

61
00:04:30,809 --> 00:04:33,311
TO GET IN ANY OF YOUR CLASSES.

62
00:04:33,312 --> 00:04:36,814
OH, OLGA KNOWS THAT--
IT'S JUST A PLOY FOR REASSURANCE.

63
00:04:36,815 --> 00:04:39,817
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
BEING MARRIED TO A PSYCHOLOGIST

64
00:04:39,818 --> 00:04:44,322
QUALIFIES YOU TO PRACTICE
ON UNWILLING PATIENTS, AND IN PUBLIC.

65
00:04:44,323 --> 00:04:45,824
I'M YOUR SISTER
AND THESE ARE OUR FRIENDS.

66
00:04:45,825 --> 00:04:48,827
DON'T BE SO SENSITIVE.

67
00:04:48,828 --> 00:04:50,329
WHERE'S HARRY AND ANDREW,
ANYWAY?

68
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,331
CHANGING THE SUBJECT
AFTER SAYING SOMETHING

69
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:54,333
CRUEL AND INSENSITIVE IS A TRAIT
MARCIA PICKED UP AS A CHILD,

70
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:56,835
AND NEVER QUITE OUTGREW.

71
00:04:56,836 --> 00:05:00,338
I'M YOUR SISTER,
THESE ARE OUR FRIENDS.

72
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:02,841
LET'S HURRY THIS UP.

73
00:05:02,842 --> 00:05:06,346
SHE'LL BE HERE BEFORE WE'RE
SET UP AND RUIN THE SURPRISE.

74
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,348
YOU'RE GIVE HER
A SURPRISE PARTY EVERY YEAR.

75
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,849
YOU REALLY THINK
SHE'S NOT EXPECTING IT?

76
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,851
WOULD YOU WANT HER NOT TO?

77
00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:13,853
IT WOULD MEAN A SERIOUS FLAW
IN HER REASONING POWER.

78
00:05:13,854 --> 00:05:16,856
I TOLD YOU WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO ARRANGE A PARTY THIS YEAR.

79
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:18,858
SHE BELIEVED US, MR. SOKOL.
IT'S NOT STUPIDITY.

80
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:20,860
IT'S SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF.

81
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:23,364
SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF
IS A LITERARY DEVICE,

82
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,866
BUT EMPLOYED IN LIFE,
IT'S CALLED PSYCHOSIS.

83
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,868
OH, SHE'S HERE.

84
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,370
WHY WOULD SHE KNOCK?

85
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,872
SHE WANTS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE
READY TO SURPRISE HER.

86
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,875
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO REALLY
OVERCOMPENSATE.

87
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:39,380
OKAY.
COME IN.

88
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:42,884
SURPRISE!

89
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:44,886
OH, LOOK SHE SURPRISED US
BACK BY COMING IN DRAG.

90
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,888
IRENE, YOUR CARD.

91
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:48,890
DO I HAVE THE RIGHT ROOM?

92
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:50,392
I'M LOOKING FOR
THE PRIOR SISTERS.

93
00:05:50,393 --> 00:05:54,396
WE'RE THE PRIOR SISTERS,
AT LEAST, TWO OF THEM.

94
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:57,399
I'M VINCENT ANTONELLI.

95
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,901
I WAS YOUR FATHER'S TEACHING
ASSISTANT IN CHARLESTON.

96
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:03,906
OH, I REMEMBER, YES.

97
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:07,910
JUST BEFORE HE CAME UP
TO NEW YORK TO ACCEPT THE CHANCELLORSHIP.

98
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:08,911
I'M--
DON'T TELL ME.

99
00:06:08,912 --> 00:06:12,415
OLGA, THE SERIOUS ONE.

100
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,917
THAT'S RIGHT.

101
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:16,419
I KNEW YOU ALL AS GIRLS.

102
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,421
WOW! GOOD MEMORY.

103
00:06:18,422 --> 00:06:20,423
I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO LOOK YOU UP FOR YEARS.

104
00:06:20,424 --> 00:06:22,426
IT'S A PLEASURE
TO RENEW YOUR ACQUAINTANCE.

105
00:06:22,427 --> 00:06:24,428
LIKEWISE, VINCENT.

106
00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:25,929
YOU, REMEMBER MY SISTER?

107
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,930
DON'T TELL ME.

108
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:28,432
MARCIA.

109
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:30,934
YOU WERE THE--

110
00:06:30,935 --> 00:06:32,936
THE BEAUTIFUL ONE.
YOU CAN SAY IT.

111
00:06:32,937 --> 00:06:35,439
SHE'S MY SISTER,
THESE ARE OUR FRIENDS.

112
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,944
THANK YOU, AND WELCOME.

113
00:06:39,945 --> 00:06:41,946
NO, PLEASE.
LET ME COME TO YOU.

114
00:06:41,947 --> 00:06:44,949
THIS GUY'S LIKE A DAY
IN FINISHING SCHOOL.

115
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,951
OH, I REMEMBER YOU NOW.

116
00:06:46,952 --> 00:06:48,953
YOU WERE IN LOVE
WITH THAT HYSTERICAL GIRL--

117
00:06:48,954 --> 00:06:51,456
THAT GIRL WHO WAS ALWAYS
PRAYING, WHAT WAS HER NAME?

118
00:06:51,457 --> 00:06:54,959
YEAH. HELEN.
I MARRIED HER.

119
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,962
I AM SO SORRY.

120
00:06:57,963 --> 00:07:00,966
IT'S TERRIBLE TO SEE CHARM
FLOUNDERING LIKE THIS.

121
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:02,968
I MEAN, NOT THAT YOU MARRIED HER
BUT FOR MY RUDE REMARK.

122
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:04,470
PLEASE, DON'T MENTION IT.

123
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:04,970
IT'S LIKE WATCHING A CAT
LOSE ITS BALANCE

124
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:06,972
AND FALL IN THE TOILET.

125
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:12,478
WE ALL SAID THAT ABOUT HELEN
BECAUSE WE HAD CRUSHES ON YOU.

126
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,480
I MEAN, WE DIDN'T ALL SAY IT.

127
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:17,483
COUNTERING HER INSULT
WITH CLUMSY COMPLIMENT.

128
00:07:17,484 --> 00:07:20,487
OH, MY GOD.

129
00:07:20,488 --> 00:07:23,990
WE HAVE TWO LOVELY LITTLE GIRLS
NOW AND I ADORE THEM.

130
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:27,994
I'M SO GLAD.

131
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:29,996
OKAY.

132
00:07:29,997 --> 00:07:34,000
COME MEET OUR FRIENDS AND
FACULTY MEMBERS, PLEASE.

133
00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:36,503
DOCTOR CHEBRIN, THE HEAD
OF THE ENGLISH DEPARTMENT.

134
00:07:36,504 --> 00:07:38,506
IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU, DOCTOR.

135
00:07:38,507 --> 00:07:41,008
OH, DON'T CALL ME DOCTOR.
I CAN'T CURE ANYTHING.

136
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:42,510
DAVID TURZIN,
PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY.

137
00:07:42,511 --> 00:07:44,512
OH, PHILOSOPHY?

138
00:07:44,513 --> 00:07:46,514
IS THAT AN EXPRESSION
OF APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL?

139
00:07:46,515 --> 00:07:49,016
DAVID'S A BIT DEFENSIVE
ABOUT THE SUBJECT.

140
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:51,519
IN MATERIALISTIC SOCIETY,
QUESTIONS OF ETHICS

141
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,521
AND LOGIC ARE CONSIDERED
LUXURIES NO ONE CAN AFFORD.

142
00:07:53,522 --> 00:07:55,523
ETHICS AND LOGIC
ARE NECESSITIES,

143
00:07:55,524 --> 00:07:57,025
NOT LUXURIES IN MY LINE OF WORK.

144
00:07:57,026 --> 00:07:58,026
WHAT IS YOUR LINE OF WORK
MR. ANTONELLI?

145
00:07:58,027 --> 00:08:00,529
VINCENT, PLEASE.

146
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,531
I WORK FOR
AN IMAGE-CONSULTING FIRM.

147
00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:03,532
OH, AN IMAGE CONSULTANT?

148
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:05,033
DAVID, YOU'VE FINALLY
MET SOMEONE WITH A JOB

149
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:06,535
MORE EXPENDABLE THAN YOUR OWN.

150
00:08:06,536 --> 00:08:09,037
OH, VINCENT-- AND THIS
BOORISH MAN IS GARY SOKOL,

151
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:11,039
POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR.

152
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,542
GARY PRIDES HIMSELF
ON BEING COMPLETELY CANDID

153
00:08:13,543 --> 00:08:15,043
AND IRRITATING.

154
00:08:15,044 --> 00:08:17,046
MERELY EXTERNAL QUALITIES.

155
00:08:17,047 --> 00:08:18,548
OUR TRUE CHARACTER LIES WITHIN,
I BELIEVE,

156
00:08:18,549 --> 00:08:20,550
BEYOND OUR IMMEDIATE PERCEPTION.

157
00:08:20,551 --> 00:08:22,552
IF YOU CAN'T PERCEIVE IT,
IT'S NOT THERE.

158
00:08:22,553 --> 00:08:24,554
IN YOUR CASE,
I'M SURE THAT'S TRUE.

159
00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:25,555
AM I INTERRUPTING
A PRIVATE PARTY?

160
00:08:25,556 --> 00:08:27,557
NO, NOT AT ALL.

161
00:08:27,558 --> 00:08:29,559
IT'S A SURPRISE BIRTHDAY PARTY
FOR OUR SISTER, IRENE.

162
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,060
IRENE?

163
00:08:31,061 --> 00:08:32,562
THE BABY.

164
00:08:32,563 --> 00:08:35,566
YES, STILL THE BABY.
EVEN AT 22.

165
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:36,567
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, IRENE.

166
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:37,568
YEAH.
HAVE FUN TODAY.

167
00:08:37,569 --> 00:08:39,570
THANK YOU.

168
00:08:59,091 --> 00:09:00,592
IS NANCY HERE YET?

169
00:09:00,593 --> 00:09:02,093
NO.
AND NEITHER IS IRENE.

170
00:09:02,094 --> 00:09:04,095
IT'S IRENE'S PARTY YOU KNOW?

171
00:09:04,096 --> 00:09:05,597
ANDREW.
HEY. HOW ARE YOU?

172
00:09:05,598 --> 00:09:07,098
GOOD.
GOOD.

173
00:09:07,099 --> 00:09:09,601
PLEASE, COME MEET VINCENT
ANTONELLI FROM CHARLESTON.

174
00:09:09,602 --> 00:09:12,604
CHARLESTON, THE MAGIC WORD
THAT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER.

175
00:09:12,605 --> 00:09:13,606
VINCENT WAS FATHER'S
TEACHING ASSISTANT.

176
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:14,607
DO YOU REMEMBER?

177
00:09:14,608 --> 00:09:16,609
NO.

178
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,610
OF COURSE, YOU DON'T.
YOU WERE JUST A BOY.

179
00:09:17,611 --> 00:09:19,612
I WAS MUCH OLDER.

180
00:09:19,613 --> 00:09:21,113
I REMEMBER
YOU WERE ALWAYS CALLED--

181
00:09:21,114 --> 00:09:22,615
THE BROTHER.

182
00:09:22,616 --> 00:09:25,117
SO, THE SERIOUS ONE,
THE BABY, THE BROTHER,

183
00:09:25,118 --> 00:09:27,620
AND THE BEAUTIFUL ONE.

184
00:09:27,621 --> 00:09:30,122
SOUNDS LIKE MARCIA WON
THE CHARLESTON NICKNAME POOL.

185
00:09:30,123 --> 00:09:32,125
WELL, WELCOME.

186
00:09:32,126 --> 00:09:32,626
THANK YOU.

187
00:09:32,627 --> 00:09:34,628
GENTLEMEN.

188
00:09:34,629 --> 00:09:36,129
WE WERE JUST TRYING
TO CONVINCE MR. ANTONELLI

189
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,631
TO STAY FOR IRENE'S PARTY.

190
00:09:37,632 --> 00:09:38,632
I REALLY JUST STOPPED BY
TO SAY HELLO

191
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:40,634
SINCE I'M IN TOWN ON BUSINESS.

192
00:09:40,635 --> 00:09:43,136
IRENE WOULD LOVE TO MEET ANYONE
FROM CHARLESTON,

193
00:09:43,137 --> 00:09:45,138
THE MYTHICAL CITY.

194
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:47,641
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

195
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:48,642
SHE'S HEARD ALL THE STORIES
BUT SHE WAS TOO YOUNG TO REMEMBER ANYTHING.

196
00:09:48,643 --> 00:09:50,143
SHE'S NEVER BEEN BACK?

197
00:09:50,144 --> 00:09:52,647
NO, WE STILL OWN THE HOUSE
ON KING STREET,

198
00:09:52,648 --> 00:09:55,149
BUT WE'VE BEEN RENTING IT OUT
FOR YEARS.

199
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,152
BUT AS SOON AS THE CURRENT LEASE
IS UP, WE PLAN ON MOVING BACK

200
00:09:58,153 --> 00:10:01,656
AND MAKING A HOME OF IT AGAIN,
BACK TO A SIMPLER WAY OF LIFE.

201
00:10:01,657 --> 00:10:02,657
DO YOU STILL LIVE THERE?

202
00:10:02,658 --> 00:10:04,158
NO. NO. NO.
NOT FOR A LONG TIME.

203
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,160
MY COMPANY IS BASED
IN BALTIMORE.

204
00:10:06,161 --> 00:10:09,664
IS THAT WHERE YOU LOST
YOUR ORIGINAL ACCENT?

205
00:10:09,665 --> 00:10:12,668
NO, DOCTOR,
I'M SECOND GENERATION ITALIAN,

206
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:14,169
JUST ENOUGH TIME
TO LOSE THE OLD COUNTRY ACCENT,

207
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,171
NOT ENOUGH TO ACQUIRE
A SOUTHERN ONE.

208
00:10:16,172 --> 00:10:19,174
THAT DIFFICULT TRANSITION
FROM IMMIGRANT TO REDNECK.

209
00:10:19,175 --> 00:10:20,676
WHAT CAME NATURALLY
TO YOU IS ACTIVELY CULTIVATED

210
00:10:20,677 --> 00:10:22,678
IN OUR HOUSEHOLD.

211
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:23,679
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

212
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,682
SOUTHERN ACCENT
STRICTLY PROHIBITED.

213
00:10:26,683 --> 00:10:28,684
YOUR DADDY AFRAID YOU'D WIND UP
IN A RUSTED OUT PICK-UP TRUCK

214
00:10:28,685 --> 00:10:29,686
ON TOBACCO ROAD.

215
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:31,688
PLEASE.

216
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:34,190
I APPRECIATE YOUR HUMOR,
MR. SOKOL AND LOOK FORWARD

217
00:10:34,191 --> 00:10:36,693
TO DISCOVERING
YOUR OTHER POSITIVE QUALITIES.

218
00:10:36,694 --> 00:10:39,195
DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH.

219
00:10:39,196 --> 00:10:43,699
THAT WAS PARTICULARLY VICIOUS
COMING FROM AN IMAGE CONSULTANT.

220
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:02,219
AM I LATE?
IS SHE HERE YET?

221
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,721
OH, WHERE'S ANDREW?

222
00:11:03,722 --> 00:11:05,222
YES. NO. UP THERE.

223
00:11:05,223 --> 00:11:06,724
OH.

224
00:11:06,725 --> 00:11:08,727
HI.

225
00:11:08,728 --> 00:11:09,728
HI BABE.

226
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:12,230
HI, BABE.

227
00:11:19,238 --> 00:11:21,239
NANCE, I THINK
YOU KNOW EVERYBODY.

228
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,241
HI, ALL AROUND.

229
00:11:23,242 --> 00:11:26,244
LIKE HI RIGHT BACK AT YOU.

230
00:11:26,245 --> 00:11:30,249
OH, AND THIS IS VINCENT
ANTONELLI FROM CHARLESTON.

231
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,251
OH.

232
00:11:32,252 --> 00:11:33,753
THIS IS NANCY PECKET,
MY FIANCE.

233
00:11:33,754 --> 00:11:35,755
I'M PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

234
00:11:35,756 --> 00:11:37,256
LIKEWISE.
SO, WHERE'S IRENE?

235
00:11:37,257 --> 00:11:38,758
WHERE'S HARRY?

236
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:41,260
OH, HARRY, HARRY.
HARRY IS PROBABLY

237
00:11:41,261 --> 00:11:44,764
WITH A PARTICULARLY CRAZY
PATIENT WHO IS EITHER HAVING

238
00:11:44,765 --> 00:11:46,767
A BREAKDOWN OR A BREAKTHROUGH,
SOMEONE WHO'S JUST REALIZED

239
00:11:46,768 --> 00:11:49,770
THEIR FATHER'S A BASTARD
AND THEIR MOTHER'S A BITCH.

240
00:11:49,771 --> 00:11:52,773
THAT'S EITHER ELATED OR
CRESTFALLEN BY THE DISCOVERY.

241
00:11:52,774 --> 00:11:54,274
WHAT?

242
00:11:54,275 --> 00:11:56,276
HER HUSBAND'S A PSYCHOLOGIST.

243
00:11:56,277 --> 00:11:58,278
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

244
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,279
OH, DOCTOR GLASS, YOUR WIFE
CALLED WHILE YOU WERE IN SESSION.

245
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,781
UH-HUH.

246
00:12:00,782 --> 00:12:03,784
TO REMIND YOU ABOUT HER SISTER'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY THIS EVENING.

247
00:12:03,785 --> 00:12:05,787
WHAT TIME DID
SHE SAY IT BEGINS?

248
00:12:05,788 --> 00:12:07,789
FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO.

249
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,793
GOOD. I'M EARLY.

250
00:12:13,295 --> 00:12:14,796
SO, WHAT ABOUT IRENE?

251
00:12:14,797 --> 00:12:16,798
IRENE HAS A CLASS UNTIL 6:00.

252
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,299
IT'S 6:00 NOW.

253
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,802
WELL, THEY'RE NOT
BEAMING HER OVER.

254
00:12:20,803 --> 00:12:22,303
IT'LL TAKE A WHILE FOR HER
TO WALK HERE.

255
00:12:22,304 --> 00:12:22,804
THE CANDLES AREN'T EVEN
ON THE CAKE YET.

256
00:12:22,805 --> 00:12:23,805
ANDREW, HELP ME.

257
00:12:23,806 --> 00:12:25,808
NO, NO. I'LL HELP.

258
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:27,309
NO, I'M GOING.
I'M GOING.

259
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,310
IRENE IS A STUDENT HERE?

260
00:12:28,311 --> 00:12:30,312
SHE GRADUATES THIS SPRING.

261
00:12:30,313 --> 00:12:31,814
WE'RE ALL DRAWN HERE LIKE MOTHS
TO FATHER'S BIG FLAME.

262
00:12:31,815 --> 00:12:33,315
HMMM.

263
00:12:33,316 --> 00:12:36,318
IRENE IS AN ENGLISH MAJOR.
OLGA TEACHES ENGLISH LIT.

264
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:38,821
I MET HARRY HERE WHEN HE WAS
TAKING ONE-DAY A WEEK

265
00:12:38,822 --> 00:12:42,324
FROM HIS PRACTICE TO GIVE
A LECTURE COURSE ON JUNG.

266
00:12:42,325 --> 00:12:43,827
BUNCH OF BULLSHIT REALLY,
BUT I WAS TOO YOUNG

267
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:45,328
TO REALIZE IT AT THAT TIME.

268
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:47,831
ANDREW WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT
IN MUSIC

269
00:12:47,832 --> 00:12:50,333
AND IS NOW
AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR.

270
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:52,335
BRAVO.

271
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:55,338
AND THAT'S HOW HE MET NANCY.

272
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:58,341
AN EXTENSION COURSE.
I WAS NOT A FULL TIME STUDENT.

273
00:12:58,342 --> 00:13:02,345
NANCY THINKS THAT TAKES
THE ONUS OFF OF SCREWING THE PROFESSOR.

274
00:13:03,348 --> 00:13:05,850
I WAS JUST KIDDIN'.

275
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:08,853
YOU WERE BOTH ADULTS.
WHO CARES?

276
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:11,355
THAT'S HOW I MET HARRY,
RUE THE DAY.

277
00:13:11,356 --> 00:13:13,357
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAY, MARCIA.
IT'S HOW YOU SAY IT.

278
00:13:13,358 --> 00:13:16,861
OH, IT'S NOT MY CONTENT
BUT MY FORM.

279
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:18,863
MAYBE, MR. ANTONELLI CAN
HELP ME POLISH UP

280
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:21,866
MY SOCIAL PRESENTATION.

281
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:27,873
START WITH ME, AND WORK YOUR WAY
UP TO MR. SOKOL.

282
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:31,877
OH, I THINK YOU'RE THE FAR
GREATER CHALLENGE THIS EVENING.

283
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,378
IT'S NOT YOUR FORM OR YOUR
CONTENT BUT YOUR INTENTION

284
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,880
THAT DISTURBS ME, MARCIA?

285
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:38,884
MY INTENTION IS MERELY
INFORMATIONAL.

286
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:42,889
I WAS JUST EXPLAINING THAT
AS A CLERK AT BERGDORF'S,

287
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:47,393
NANCY HEARD THE CALL
AND WAS MESMERIZED.

288
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:51,898
"I'M A SHOP GIRL," SHE SAID,
WITH NO TIME FOR A DEGREE.

289
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,901
WHY NOT TAKE
AN EXTENSION COURSE?

290
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:56,402
MARCIA.

291
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:57,904
OH, MARCIA.

292
00:13:57,905 --> 00:14:00,908
I CAN TELL MY OWN STORY,
YOU KNOW, IT'S MY STORY.

293
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:02,910
OH, I THINK I CAN TELL IT
MUCH MORE INTERESTINGLY

294
00:14:02,911 --> 00:14:05,412
WITH MY OBJECTIVE DISTANCE.

295
00:14:05,413 --> 00:14:07,414
THAT'S WHAT
A GOOD BIOGRAPHER'S FOR, RIGHT?

296
00:14:07,415 --> 00:14:08,916
FASCINATING, SHE USED ME
AS A TEMPORARY DIVERSION

297
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:11,418
TO GET HERSELF OFF THE HOT SEAT.

298
00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:12,920
THEN, SHE LIFTS HER SKIRT AND
PUTS HER ASS RIGHT BACK ON IT.

299
00:14:12,921 --> 00:14:13,921
MARCIA?
YES?

300
00:14:13,922 --> 00:14:17,925
LET NANCY TELL IT.

301
00:14:17,926 --> 00:14:18,926
WELL, WHY DON'T I TELL MY
VERSION FIRST AND WE'LL SEE

302
00:14:18,927 --> 00:14:22,430
IF IT'S NOT BETTER?

303
00:14:22,431 --> 00:14:26,434
THANK YOU. SO--

304
00:14:26,435 --> 00:14:30,438
AFTER A LONG DAY OF SELLING
BLACK PANTYHOSE

305
00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:34,943
TO MIDDLE-AGED UPPER EASTSIDE
WOMEN OBSESSED WITH CELLULITE

306
00:14:34,944 --> 00:14:36,945
AND VARICOSE VEINS,

307
00:14:36,946 --> 00:14:40,449
NANCY WAS ATTRACTED
TO MANHATTAN CREST COLLEGE

308
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:46,956
LIKE TRILBY TO SVENGALI, LIKE
CZARINA ALEXANDRA TO RASPUTIN.

309
00:14:46,957 --> 00:14:50,960
A VOICE KEPT REPEATING
IN HER HEAD--

310
00:14:50,961 --> 00:14:53,963
"I DON'T HAVE THE PATIENCE TO
GET A DEGREE, BUT I COULD TAKE

311
00:14:53,964 --> 00:14:55,965
AN EXTENSION COURSE."

312
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:58,468
OH, YOU ARE SO OBNOXIOUS.

313
00:14:58,469 --> 00:15:03,473
"WOW ALL THE OTHER CLERKS WITH
MY KNOWLEDGE OF GREAT MUSIC."

314
00:15:03,474 --> 00:15:07,477
"SMUGLY IDENTIFYING ALL OF THE
MONTAVELLI TUNES COMING OVER THE-

315
00:15:07,478 --> 00:15:09,479
REALLY MARCIA, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S COME OVER YOU LATELY

316
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,981
BUT, WHOO--

317
00:15:16,487 --> 00:15:18,990
HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR.

318
00:15:18,991 --> 00:15:20,992
NANCY SEES THE FUN IN ALL THIS.

319
00:15:20,993 --> 00:15:22,493
SURE, NOT SINCE HER HEAD-ON
COLLISION AS SHE HAD

320
00:15:22,494 --> 00:15:24,495
SUCH  A GREAT TIME.

321
00:15:24,496 --> 00:15:29,500
YOU KNOW I DON'T, MARCIA.
REALLY, I DON'T.

322
00:15:32,004 --> 00:15:36,007
I'M SORRY.

323
00:15:36,008 --> 00:15:39,011
YOU TELL YOUR VERSION THEN.

324
00:15:41,514 --> 00:15:46,018
OH, NO, NO--
BETTER YET, YOU CAN TELL

325
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,520
THE STORY THAT HOW I MET HARRY
TO GET BACK AT ME.

326
00:15:48,521 --> 00:15:51,523
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S STOP NOW.

327
00:15:51,524 --> 00:15:53,525
YOU REALLY WANT ME
TO TELL IT?

328
00:15:53,526 --> 00:15:55,528
DO YOU KNOW IT?

329
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:58,031
I THINK SO.

330
00:15:58,032 --> 00:16:02,035
THEN TELL IT.

331
00:16:03,537 --> 00:16:06,039
OH ENOUGH.

332
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,541
INVITATION DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT PSYCHODRAMA.

333
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:11,544
PERHAPS I SHOULD LEAVE,
I FEEL SOMEHOW RESPONSIBLE.

334
00:16:11,545 --> 00:16:13,546
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

335
00:16:13,547 --> 00:16:14,548
YOU'RE ABOUT AS INCIDENTAL

336
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:17,051
AS A SPECTATOR
AT AN ANCIENT GREEK TRAGEDY.

337
00:16:17,052 --> 00:16:20,554
THE PLAY IS REALLY AN OFFERING
TO THE GODS, NOT THE AUDIENCE.

338
00:16:20,555 --> 00:16:25,059
GO AHEAD, NANCY,
MAKE YOUR A LITTLE OFFERING.

339
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,561
LET'S SEE, UH.

340
00:16:27,562 --> 00:16:29,563
TERRIBLE START--JUST LAUNCH
RIGHT INTO THE NARRATIVE.

341
00:16:29,564 --> 00:16:35,570
ALL RIGHT, YOU WERE A LONELY
WOMAN IN HER LATE '20s,

342
00:16:35,571 --> 00:16:38,073
WHO HAD JUST
AN UNHAPPY LOVE AFFAIR,

343
00:16:38,074 --> 00:16:43,578
YOUR LATEST, THAT LEFT YOU
SUICIDAL AGAIN.

344
00:16:46,582 --> 00:16:48,583
I LIKE THE USE OF THE
UNFLATTERING MODIFIER FOR EMPHASIS.

345
00:16:48,584 --> 00:16:50,085
VERY EFFECTIVE.

346
00:16:50,086 --> 00:16:52,587
THANK YOU.

347
00:16:52,588 --> 00:16:55,591
SO, NO ONE COULD CONVINCE YOU
TO GO INTO THERAPY, BUT YOU DID

348
00:16:55,592 --> 00:17:00,096
AGREE TO ATTEND SOME PSYCHOLOGY
LECTURES INSTEAD.

349
00:17:00,097 --> 00:17:03,099
WELL, THAT'S TRUE.
WE'RE A FAMILY OF SCHOLARS.

350
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,102
AND YOU MET HARRY, WHO IS
ATTRACTED TO YOU BECAUSE YOU

351
00:17:06,103 --> 00:17:11,107
ARE SO FUCKED UP.

352
00:17:14,112 --> 00:17:15,112
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S STOP THIS.

353
00:17:15,113 --> 00:17:16,613
YES, IT'S TRUE,
I WAS FUCKED UP,

354
00:17:16,614 --> 00:17:20,617
A WALKING TEXTBOOK.

355
00:17:20,618 --> 00:17:22,619
HARRY LOOKED RIGHT PAST MY
PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES

356
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:27,124
TO WHAT REALLY GOT HIM HOT--
A DAMAGED PSYCHE.

357
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:30,127
SO GO ON.

358
00:17:30,128 --> 00:17:34,632
SO HE THOUGHT HE COULD MAKE YOU
HAPPY SO HE MARRIED YOU.

359
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:39,137
BUT INSTEAD OF MAKING YOU HAPPY,
YOU'VE MADE HIM MISERABLE

360
00:17:39,138 --> 00:17:42,140
AND DEPRESSED AND YOU WON'T HAVE
ANY CHILDREN.

361
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:44,142
OH, THIS IS HORRIBLE
AND PRIMITIVE! STOP IT!

362
00:17:44,143 --> 00:17:45,643
NO, ANDREW, YOU'VE GIVEN NANCY
YOUR BALLS NOW.

363
00:17:45,644 --> 00:17:47,145
LET HER USE THEM.

364
00:17:47,146 --> 00:17:49,647
YOU WON'T HAVE ANY CHILDREN
BECAUSE YOU ARE TOO SELFISH

365
00:17:49,648 --> 00:17:54,153
AND UNSTABLE AND YOU
MIGHT HURT THEM.

366
00:17:54,154 --> 00:18:00,159
YOU MIGHT HURT THEM EMOTIONALLY
OR PHYSICALLY.

367
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:12,172
OH, THIS IS A MAJOR
OFFERING TO THE GODS.

368
00:18:12,173 --> 00:18:16,176
THEY'LL BE BELCHING AND FARTING
THIS ONE FOR DAYS.

369
00:18:21,682 --> 00:18:26,186
THERE, I THINK NANCY TOPPED
ME WITH THAT STORY.

370
00:18:26,187 --> 00:18:27,187
DON'T YOU, GENTLEMEN?

371
00:18:27,188 --> 00:18:31,692
DEFINITELY.

372
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:36,197
MORE PROBING, MORE VICIOUS,
ALTHOUGH ALMOST COMPLETELY

373
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,199
LACKING IN HUMOR, AND I THINK
NANCY WOULD EVEN AGREE

374
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,700
THAT SHE HAD TO BORROW
SOME OF THE THREE

375
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:42,703
AND FOUR SYLLABLE WORDS
FROM ANDREW.

376
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,705
A REGURGITATION
OF HIS FAMILY RUMINATIONS,

377
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:50,712
BUT A CREDITABLE ONE
WHICH NANCY MANAGED TO IMBUE

378
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:55,717
WITH HER OWN DIRECT STYLE.

379
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,222
BRAVA.

380
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:06,228
COME ON.

381
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:12,735
I'M NOT GOING TO PULL YOU DOWN.

382
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:14,737
THE FALL WOULDN'T KILL YOU
ANYWAY, JUST GET YOU SOME MORE

383
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:16,238
SYMPATHY FROM ANDREW.

384
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:19,742
OH, HERE SHE COMES.

385
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,244
QUICK HELP ME LIGHT THE CANDLES.

386
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:22,745
OH GOD, GO, GO--

387
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:26,249
HURRY UP.

388
00:19:27,252 --> 00:19:28,252
SURPRISE!

389
00:19:28,253 --> 00:19:30,254
SURPRISE!

390
00:19:30,255 --> 00:19:33,257
YOU ALL.
I HAD A FEELING.

391
00:19:33,258 --> 00:19:36,260
CALL IT A CRAZY HUNCH.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

392
00:19:36,261 --> 00:19:37,261
THANK YOU.

393
00:19:37,262 --> 00:19:38,262
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DARLING.

394
00:19:38,263 --> 00:19:38,762
OH.

395
00:19:38,763 --> 00:19:40,264
YOU SWEET GIRL.

396
00:19:40,265 --> 00:19:41,265
HI.

397
00:19:41,266 --> 00:19:42,266
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

398
00:19:42,267 --> 00:19:43,767
THANK YOU.

399
00:19:43,768 --> 00:19:44,768
OH, NANCY.

400
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:46,271
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, IRENE.

401
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:48,273
OH, THANK YOU.

402
00:19:48,274 --> 00:19:52,277
DR. CHEBRIN.

403
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:53,778
MANY HAPPY RETURNS,
MY DARLING.

404
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:55,780
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

405
00:19:55,781 --> 00:19:57,282
HI, DAVID.

406
00:19:57,283 --> 00:20:01,286
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, IRENE.

407
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:03,288
GEE, DAVID WHY NOT USE IRENE'S
BIRTHDAY AS AN EXCUSE TO EXPLORE

408
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:05,791
HER DIGESTIVE TRACT
WITH YOUR TONGUE.

409
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:07,793
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
SHUT UP, GARY?

410
00:20:07,794 --> 00:20:09,295
YOU'RE REALLY RUDE
AND OFFENSIVE, YOU KNOW THAT?

411
00:20:09,296 --> 00:20:10,796
OF COURSE.
YOU JUST NOTICED?

412
00:20:10,797 --> 00:20:13,299
OH, DAVE,
HE WAS JUST KIDDING.

413
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,302
NO, IRENE, IT'S BEEN HAPPENING
ALL EVENING, IT MUST BE PLANETARY.

414
00:20:16,303 --> 00:20:18,304
COME, MEET OUR FRIEND, VINCENT
ANTONELLI FROM CHARLESTON.

415
00:20:18,305 --> 00:20:23,810
CHARLESTON, SO MUCH FOR GETTING
A PIECE OF CAKE, ANYTIME SOON.

416
00:20:23,811 --> 00:20:25,312
OH MY, IT'S A PLEASURE.

417
00:20:25,313 --> 00:20:27,314
PLEASURE IS ALWAYS HIS.

418
00:20:27,315 --> 00:20:29,316
THANK YOU, MR. SOKOL.

419
00:20:29,317 --> 00:20:30,817
VINCENT WAS FATHER'S TEACHING
ASSISTANT IN CHARLESTON.

420
00:20:30,818 --> 00:20:32,319
HE KNEW US AS GIRLS.

421
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,320
REALLY?

422
00:20:33,321 --> 00:20:35,322
UH-HMM.

423
00:20:35,323 --> 00:20:37,324
AND NANCY AND I HELPED TO FILL
HIM IN ON SOME OF OUR MOST

424
00:20:37,325 --> 00:20:38,325
RECENT FAMILY HISTORY.

425
00:20:38,326 --> 00:20:40,327
OKAY, ALL LIT.
COME MAKE A WISH.

426
00:20:40,328 --> 00:20:42,329
OH, OKAY.

427
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,332
BLOW OUT THE CANDLES.
NOW, MAKE A WISH.

428
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,834
MAKE A WISH.

429
00:20:46,835 --> 00:20:52,840
OH.

430
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:55,343
JUST BEING HERE WITH YOU ALL.

431
00:20:55,344 --> 00:20:57,845
NO, NO, NO-- COME ON,
MAKE A GOOD WISH.

432
00:20:57,846 --> 00:20:59,847
SOMETHING INVOLVING
MAJOR APPLIANCES OR REAL ESTATE.

433
00:20:59,848 --> 00:21:02,851
WAIT, I'VE GOT IT.

434
00:21:05,355 --> 00:21:08,857
YEAH.

435
00:21:08,858 --> 00:21:12,361
SPEECH.

436
00:21:12,362 --> 00:21:14,363
SPEECH?

437
00:21:14,364 --> 00:21:19,368
OKAY, OKAY.
I KNOW I'LL ALWAYS BE THE BABY

438
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:26,370
IN THE FAMILY, BUT I'M
NOT A BABY ANYMORE.

439
00:21:26,377 --> 00:21:28,878
FATHER SAID SOMETHING TO ME
WHILE WE'RE STILL IN CHARLESTON,

440
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:34,884
HE SAID, "YOUR MOST PRECIOUS
POSSESSIONS ARE YOUR FAMILY.

441
00:21:34,885 --> 00:21:39,889
"THEY ARE THE SUPPORTING BEAM
OF YOUR LIFE, THEY ARE THE LIGHT

442
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,392
THAT GUIDES YOU, THE SACRED--"

443
00:21:41,393 --> 00:21:43,894
THREE METAPHORS
AND YOU'RE OUT.

444
00:21:43,895 --> 00:21:45,396
WILL YOU JUST--

445
00:21:45,397 --> 00:21:48,899
NO, GARY, HE'S RIGHT.
THIS IS SO CORNY.

446
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,404
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I
LOVE YOU ALL AND EVEN THOUGH

447
00:21:53,405 --> 00:21:54,905
I KNOW YOU'RE ALWAYS BE
THERE TO SUPPORT ME--

448
00:21:54,906 --> 00:21:57,408
LIKE A BEAM.

449
00:21:57,409 --> 00:22:00,912
YOU'RE RIGHT, GARY,
LIKE A BEAM.

450
00:22:00,913 --> 00:22:04,916
I WANT VERY MUCH TO BE ABLE
TO SUPPORT MYSELF AND YOU,

451
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:08,420
IF YOU NEED ME.

452
00:22:08,421 --> 00:22:10,922
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S MY GOAL FOR 22.

453
00:22:10,923 --> 00:22:13,424
OH, IT WAS BEAUTIFUL, BABY.

454
00:22:15,428 --> 00:22:17,929
I FEEL LIKE I JUST GOT HIT
BY A STACK OF HALLMARK CARDS.

455
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:20,933
OKAY, GARY'S RIGHT, LET'S EAT.

456
00:22:20,934 --> 00:22:23,436
I'LL CUT THE CAKE.

457
00:22:23,437 --> 00:22:24,437
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE?

458
00:22:24,438 --> 00:22:25,438
SURE, SHOOT.

459
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:26,939
DOWNSTAIRS, PLEASE.

460
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,940
UH-OH.

461
00:22:27,941 --> 00:22:29,942
EVERYONE KNOWS
YOU'RE PISSED OFF.

462
00:22:29,943 --> 00:22:30,443
WHY NOT JUST BE OPEN ABOUT IT
AND GET IT OVER WITH?

463
00:22:30,444 --> 00:22:31,944
NOT NOW, PLEASE.

464
00:22:31,945 --> 00:22:32,445
WHAT HAPPENED?

465
00:22:32,446 --> 00:22:33,946
OH, NOTHING.

466
00:22:33,947 --> 00:22:37,450
YEAH, EVERYONE KNOWS
I'M PISSED OFF.

467
00:22:37,451 --> 00:22:39,453
BUT THEY DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW
PISSED OFF I AM OR HOW I'M GOING

468
00:22:39,454 --> 00:22:42,456
TO EXPRESS IT AND I'D LIKE
TO DISCUSS THAT WITH YOU ALONE.

469
00:22:42,457 --> 00:22:44,958
I'M IN TROUBLE.

470
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:47,461
DARLING, HELP ME PASS THESE OUT,

471
00:22:47,462 --> 00:22:47,961
MAYBE YOU COULD PLAY
THE PIANO FOR US LATER.

472
00:22:47,962 --> 00:22:52,966
YEAH.

473
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:54,968
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY,
BUT YOU KNOW I CAN'T STAND

474
00:22:54,969 --> 00:22:58,473
THAT VULGAR GIRL AND YOU INSIST
ON FOISTING HER UPON YOUR SISTERS AND ME.

475
00:22:58,474 --> 00:23:01,476
I CAN NO LONGER HIDE MY TRUE
FEELINGS ABOUT HER. STOP IT.

476
00:23:01,477 --> 00:23:04,979
YOU WON'T EVEN GIVE ME THE
SATISFACTION OF CHEWING YOU OUT.

477
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,982
WHAT ARE YOU CHASTISING ME FOR?
YOU SHOULD BE APOLOGIZING;

478
00:23:07,983 --> 00:23:09,984
YOU ATTACK HER AND EMBARRASS HER
WITH YOUR VICIOUS--

479
00:23:09,985 --> 00:23:11,986
I RAN OUT OF CHARM WITH HER
ALONG TIME AGO.

480
00:23:11,987 --> 00:23:14,489
YOU RAN OUT OF EVERYTHING,
MARCIA, INCLUDING BASIC HUMAN DECENCY.

481
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,492
YOU IMPUGN MY MASCULINITY
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

482
00:23:16,493 --> 00:23:18,994
WAIT UNTIL SHE FINISHES
WITH YOU.

483
00:23:18,995 --> 00:23:21,997
I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU,
I WANT TO WARN YOU.

484
00:23:21,998 --> 00:23:23,999
YOU SEE HER AS A GIRL, I KNOW
THE KIND OF WOMAN SHE IS,

485
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,001
I KNOW WHAT SHE'S CAPABLE
OF DOING TO A MAN.

486
00:23:26,002 --> 00:23:27,002
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW, YOU'VE BEEN
DOING IT TO YOUR HUSBAND

487
00:23:27,003 --> 00:23:29,505
FOR FIVE YEARS.

488
00:23:29,506 --> 00:23:31,507
PERHAPS.

489
00:23:31,508 --> 00:23:35,010
CALL ME A BITCH,
A SHREW, A HARPY,

490
00:23:35,011 --> 00:23:37,013
THAT ONE COULD GIVE ME LESSONS.

491
00:23:37,014 --> 00:23:39,516
AM I TERRIBLY LATE?

492
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:40,517
CERTAINLY MISSED
ALL THE JUICY STUFF.

493
00:23:40,518 --> 00:23:42,519
I'M SO SORRY.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, IRENE.

494
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,520
THANK YOU.

495
00:23:43,521 --> 00:23:44,521
HAVE A PIECE OF CAKE.

496
00:23:44,522 --> 00:23:46,022
I'M SORRY.

497
00:23:46,023 --> 00:23:49,526
OH THANKS, BUT WHERE'S--
OH, EXCUSE ME.

498
00:23:49,527 --> 00:23:51,528
I'LL BE BETTER.

499
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:55,032
I'M SORRY, ANDREW.
PLEASE DON'T HATE ME.

500
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:58,035
I TRIED TO KIND OF JUST RANDOMLY
SUCK FACE WITH YOU EARLIER BUT--

501
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:00,037
YEAH, I--
IT WAS GOOD WASN'T IT?

502
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:01,539
IT'S A BOOK--

503
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,040
WELL, IT IS.

504
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,041
DID YOU SEE THAT SAID THAT AT
THE SAME TIME WITH YOU?

505
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:07,044
I'M PSYCHIC I THINK.

506
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:10,047
AM I INTERRUPTING SOMETHING?

507
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:13,552
NO, NOT AT ALL.
SHOULD WE JOIN THE OTHERS?

508
00:24:13,553 --> 00:24:16,555
I'LL BE UP IN A MINUTE.

509
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:20,058
HI.

510
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,560
SORRY I'M LATE.

511
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:23,061
I KNOW, I HEARD.

512
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:24,563
JEEZ, MARCIA, I HAD A PATIENT.

513
00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:26,565
I'VE HEARD THAT TOO, YES.

514
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:28,567
HOW LATE DOES THIS GO?

515
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:30,068
YOU JUST GOT HERE.

516
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:31,570
WE HAVE THE WALDEMAN SOIREE
THIS EVENING.

517
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:34,073
WE HAVE NO SUCH THING.

518
00:24:34,074 --> 00:24:37,076
I TOLD YOU ABOUT IT.
YOU SAID, "YES."

519
00:24:37,077 --> 00:24:39,579
HOW COULD I HAVE SAID YES?
IT'S MY SISTER'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.

520
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,081
I TOLD YOU, YOU SAID,
"YES, WE'D STOP BY LATER."

521
00:24:42,082 --> 00:24:44,584
NEVER.

522
00:24:44,585 --> 00:24:46,586
OR MAYBE YOU'RE BLOCKING IT
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO GO.

523
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:49,589
MAYBE-- MAYBE I'M BLOCKING IT,
REPRESSING IT, DENYING IT,

524
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:52,092
SUBLIMATING IT, BUT I GUARANTEE
YOU THIS, I AM NOT GOING

525
00:24:52,093 --> 00:24:54,595
TO SPEND THE EVENING WITH THOSE
TWO OSSIFIED OLD FARTS.

526
00:24:54,596 --> 00:24:57,097
WAIT, THEY HEAD THE FOUNDATION,
AND THE FOUNDATION SUPPLIES

527
00:24:57,098 --> 00:24:59,099
MOST OF MY REFERRALS.

528
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,101
OR DID YOU THINK MY PATIENTS
JUST WALK IN OFF THE STREET

529
00:25:01,102 --> 00:25:02,102
WHEN THEY'RE FEELING
A LITTLE CRAZY?

530
00:25:02,103 --> 00:25:03,604
I DON'T CARE IF THEY'RE
AIRLIFTED FROM BELLEVUE.

531
00:25:03,605 --> 00:25:05,606
I'M NOT GOING.

532
00:25:05,607 --> 00:25:07,608
YOU TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY
FOR MAINTAINING MY CAREER,

533
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:09,109
WHICH MAINTAINS YOUR LIFESTYLE.

534
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:12,113
WHICH MAINTAINS YOUR CAREER.

535
00:25:12,114 --> 00:25:13,615
WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITHOUT
A WELL-DRESSED WIFE

536
00:25:13,616 --> 00:25:17,118
TO DISPLAY BEFORE THAT GROUP
OF OVER-EDUCATED DULLARDS

537
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:20,121
AND CLOSET-LOONIES
YOU CALL YOUR COLLEAGUES?

538
00:25:20,122 --> 00:25:22,624
IT'S SYMBIOSIS, HARRY.

539
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:29,130
BUT LET'S BREAK THE CYCLE,
SHALL WE?

540
00:25:29,131 --> 00:25:34,136
YOU TAKE THE ORNAMENTATION AND
I'LL TAKE THE EVENING OFF.

541
00:25:34,137 --> 00:25:36,639
YOU LOVE THESE LITTLE
SPECTACLES, DON'T YOU?

542
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,640
THEY VALIDATE YOU SOMEHOW.

543
00:25:37,641 --> 00:25:40,142
YES, YES, AND YOU TOO.

544
00:25:40,143 --> 00:25:43,646
THE KIND AND CARING DOCTOR
WITH THE MAD WIFE,

545
00:25:43,647 --> 00:25:46,649
PATIENTLY ENDURING ME LIKE SOME
ONGOING HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT.

546
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,651
YOUR STATE OF MIND IS NOTHING
FOR ME TO BE PROUD OF.

547
00:25:48,652 --> 00:25:53,156
IT'S A PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY
AND SO ARE YOU.

548
00:25:53,157 --> 00:25:55,158
AS USUAL, YOU'VE GONE FROM
POMPOUS TO OBNOXIOUS

549
00:25:55,159 --> 00:26:01,665
WITHOUT STOPPING AT AMUSING.

550
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:07,170
KEEP THESE, YOU LOSE ALL
YOUR CHARM WITHOUT THEM.

551
00:26:18,183 --> 00:26:21,185
WHY DON'T YOU PLAY
SOMETHING NOW?

552
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:47,713
TAXI, TAXI.

553
00:27:23,251 --> 00:27:27,756
YOU REALLY DIDN'T HAVE
TO DO THIS, YOU KNOW.

554
00:27:27,757 --> 00:27:30,759
I WOULDN'T HAVE CONSIDERED
LEAVING YOU ALONE.

555
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,762
WOULDN'T YOUR WIFE
BE WORRIED ABOUT YOU?

556
00:27:33,763 --> 00:27:36,765
MY WIFE'S IN BALTIMORE.

557
00:27:36,766 --> 00:27:38,767
UH, EXCUSE ME.

558
00:27:38,768 --> 00:27:44,774
THAT WAS SHAMELESSLY COY
AND INDIRECT OF ME.

559
00:27:44,775 --> 00:27:47,777
BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, NO.

560
00:27:47,778 --> 00:27:52,782
MY WIFE WOULDN'T BE
TOO CONCERNED.

561
00:27:52,783 --> 00:27:55,785
IT'S NONE OF MY
BUSINESS, REALLY.

562
00:27:55,786 --> 00:27:57,787
BEARING MY EMOTIONAL SCARS IN
PUBLIC IS A DISTASTEFUL HABIT

563
00:27:57,788 --> 00:28:00,790
I'VE ACQUIRED OVER THE YEARS.

564
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:02,291
I HAVE NO RIGHT TO ASK YOU
OR ANYONE ELSE TO DO THE SAME.

565
00:28:02,292 --> 00:28:03,794
BELIEVE ME.

566
00:28:03,795 --> 00:28:08,799
WHY NOT?

567
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:13,303
IT'S JUST TO SEARCH FOR
KINDREDNESS AND CONSOLATION, ISN'T IT?

568
00:28:13,304 --> 00:28:14,805
WHAT A DESOLATE SADNESS TO THINK
THAT YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON

569
00:28:14,806 --> 00:28:19,810
WHO SUFFERS IN MARRIAGE.

570
00:28:19,811 --> 00:28:23,314
MY MARRIAGE IS
AN ABYSMAL FAILURE.

571
00:28:23,315 --> 00:28:28,820
A BARELY MANAGEABLE DISASTER.

572
00:28:28,821 --> 00:28:31,823
SO, WHY STAY?

573
00:28:31,824 --> 00:28:38,329
WHY STAY ON?

574
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:40,331
YOU BARTER AWAY SO MANY PIECES

575
00:28:40,332 --> 00:28:45,838
OF YOURSELF
IN A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP.

576
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:50,342
I'M NOT SURE I REMEMBER
WHICH ARE MINE

577
00:28:50,343 --> 00:28:55,347
OR HOW I GO ABOUT
RECLAIMING THEM.

578
00:28:55,348 --> 00:28:59,351
AND THEN, THEY'RE MY GIRLS.

579
00:28:59,352 --> 00:29:06,353
THEY'RE THE LIGHT OF MY LIFE AND
I COULDN'T BEAR TO LOSE THEM.

580
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,361
BUT I'M SURE YOUR FATHER FELT
THE SAME WAY ABOUT YOU, GIRLS.

581
00:29:08,362 --> 00:29:12,866
OH, YEAH. EXACTLY.

582
00:29:12,867 --> 00:29:16,369
HE WANTED US WITH HIM
ALL THE TIME, REALLY,

583
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:20,875
EVERY GOD DAMN MINUTE
FOR ETERNITY.

584
00:29:20,876 --> 00:29:24,378
HIS VOICE ECHOING IN OUR HEADS,
HIS PORTRAITS AND PHOTOGRAPHS

585
00:29:24,379 --> 00:29:25,880
PLASTERED ON OUR WALLS.

586
00:29:25,881 --> 00:29:29,884
FATHER MARCHING
THROUGH TIME WITH US.

587
00:29:29,885 --> 00:29:32,887
HIS PRESENCE INDELIBLE.

588
00:29:32,888 --> 00:29:34,388
I HAD NO IDEA YOU--

589
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:39,394
HATED HIM A LITTLE BIT.

590
00:29:39,395 --> 00:29:40,896
IT'S ONLY NATURAL FOR A CHILD
TO RESIST AUTHORITY,

591
00:29:40,897 --> 00:29:43,398
DON'T YOU THINK?

592
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:46,902
FATHER WAS THE ULTIMATE
AUTHORITARIAN,

593
00:29:46,903 --> 00:29:50,405
THE DEADLIEST KIND,
THE CHARMING KIND.

594
00:29:50,406 --> 00:29:51,907
THE KIND YOU WANT TO PLEASE EVEN
WHEN YOU KNOW THEY'RE WRONG,

595
00:29:51,908 --> 00:29:52,908
AND LATER--

596
00:29:52,909 --> 00:29:55,911
MARCIA?

597
00:29:55,912 --> 00:30:00,416
MUCH LATER, YOU'VE REALIZED
YOU'VE VIOLATED A PART OF YOURSELF.

598
00:30:00,417 --> 00:30:04,921
SO, HERE I AM.

599
00:30:04,922 --> 00:30:10,426
YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH,
RESISTING MY FATHER'S AUTHORITY,

600
00:30:10,427 --> 00:30:13,930
"NO DADDY, IT'S OKAY TO BE
ALONE WITH VINCENT."

601
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:17,434
"I WONT GO HOME YET."

602
00:30:17,435 --> 00:30:19,937
DELAYED REACTION, HUH?

603
00:30:19,938 --> 00:30:23,440
YEAH.

604
00:30:23,441 --> 00:30:24,942
BETTER LATE THAN NEVER.

605
00:30:24,943 --> 00:30:28,445
YOUR FAMILY ALWAYS SEEMED
SO HAPPY TO ME.

606
00:30:28,446 --> 00:30:30,447
FOR YEARS, I THINK, I'VE HELD
YOU UP AS A KIND OF IDEAL

607
00:30:30,448 --> 00:30:32,449
TO STRIVE FOR MY OWN FAMILY.

608
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,952
NOT AN IDEAL, AN ILLUSION.

609
00:30:34,953 --> 00:30:37,455
ON THE SURFACE OF THINGS,
OF COURSE WE SEEMED HAPPY.

610
00:30:37,456 --> 00:30:41,459
AFTER MOTHER DIED, WE WERE
REWARDED WITH FATHER'S APPROVAL

611
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:48,460
BY DOING EXACTLY WHAT HE
EXPECTED OF US.

612
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:50,969
FATHER WANTED HIS FIRST CHILD
TO BE A BOY,

613
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:54,973
SO OLGA GAVE UP
HER FEMININITY FOR HIM.

614
00:30:54,974 --> 00:31:01,480
AND AFTER MOTHER WAS GONE I
BECAME THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE AT 13.

615
00:31:01,481 --> 00:31:03,482
HOSTESSING DINNER PARTIES,
AND FACULTY GATHERINGS,

616
00:31:03,483 --> 00:31:04,984
A GRACIOUS SOUTHERN BELL.

617
00:31:04,985 --> 00:31:06,986
HI, HOW ARE YOU?

618
00:31:06,987 --> 00:31:12,491
I REMEMBER.
IT WAS CHARMING.

619
00:31:12,492 --> 00:31:14,995
IT WAS UNSAVORY.

620
00:31:14,996 --> 00:31:18,999
I WAS A MIDGET SCARLET OHARA.

621
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,502
A CHILD PRODIGY
MARTHA STEWART.

622
00:31:22,503 --> 00:31:24,004
IT TOOK ME YEARS TO REALIZE
THAT IT WASN'T ME, BUT A ROLE

623
00:31:24,005 --> 00:31:28,008
I HAD ADOPTED.

624
00:31:28,009 --> 00:31:31,011
I'M SO SORRY.

625
00:31:31,012 --> 00:31:33,013
BUT YOU SEEMED
TO HAVE REALIZED YOURSELF.

626
00:31:33,014 --> 00:31:35,016
OH YES.

627
00:31:35,017 --> 00:31:37,018
AS EVIDENCED BY MY
PERFORMANCE THIS EVENING,

628
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:38,519
I'VE BECOME A MOST COMPLETELY
GRACELESS, CHARMLESS

629
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,022
AND TACTLESS.

630
00:31:41,023 --> 00:31:45,026
HONEST, I'D CALL IT.

631
00:31:46,528 --> 00:31:49,530
THANK YOU.

632
00:31:49,531 --> 00:31:51,032
I SUPPOSE I FAIRED BETTER
THAN ANDREW,

633
00:31:51,033 --> 00:31:53,034
WHO HAD TO HAND HIS BALLS OVER
TO FATHER.

634
00:31:53,035 --> 00:31:56,538
ONLY ONE PAIR ALLOWED IN
THE HOUSE AT A TIME, YOU KNOW.

635
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,041
AFTER FATHER DIED ANDREW
GOT THEM BACK.

636
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,542
BUT STRANGELY ENOUGH,
HE KEEPS LOOKING

637
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:04,046
FOR SOMEONE ELSE
TO GIVE THEM TO.

638
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,048
OLGA AND I PASSED THEM BACK
AND FORTH FOR A WHILE,

639
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:10,052
BUT WE REALLY DIDN'T
WANT THEM.

640
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,555
HE FINALLY FOUND A REAL TAKER
IN NANCY, WHO IT SEEMS

641
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:18,060
HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR AN EXTRA
PAIR FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

642
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:28,071
AND IRENE?

643
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:32,576
UH, IRENE WAS SO YOUNG
WHEN FATHER DIED.

644
00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:38,082
I REALLY BELIEVE SHE HAS
EMERGED UNSCATHED.

645
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:41,085
MOST OF HER RECOLLECTIONS
OF FATHER ARE ACTUALLY STORIES

646
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:45,589
THAT OLGA AND I
REPEATED TO HER-- "FATHER'S GREATEST HITS."

647
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,592
OTHER THINGS WE SIMPLY INVENTED.

648
00:32:48,593 --> 00:32:53,598
LIKE THE STORY SHE TOLD
OVER HER BIRTHDAY CAKE TONIGHT.

649
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:59,604
FATHER NEVER SAID THOSE THINGS
TO HER, WE DID.

650
00:32:59,605 --> 00:33:06,605
WHAT? I KNOW WHEN SOMEONE'S
LOOKING OR THINKING ASKANCED AT ME.

651
00:33:08,114 --> 00:33:11,617
IT'S JUST YOU PRIDE
YOURSELF ON HONESTY.

652
00:33:11,618 --> 00:33:13,119
YOU'RE BRUTALLY HONEST
WITH YOURSELF.

653
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,623
YES, A LOT OF OTHER POOR
UNFORTUNATE SOULS.

654
00:33:17,624 --> 00:33:24,624
YES-- AND YET YOU SPIN
FANTASIES FOR IRENE?

655
00:33:25,132 --> 00:33:32,133
NOT FANTASIES.
SIMPLY A REFINED REALITY.

656
00:33:35,143 --> 00:33:37,144
WHY NOT GIVE HER SOMETHING
SOLID TO BUILD ON.

657
00:33:37,145 --> 00:33:42,649
BECAUSE IT'S IMAGINARY,
FRAGMENTARY.

658
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:47,154
ULTIMATELY IT'S NOT
A TRUE FOUNDATION.

659
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:50,158
I'M SORRY, PERHAPS
I'VE OVERSTEPPED.

660
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,162
NO. NO.

661
00:33:54,163 --> 00:33:59,167
YOU MAYBE RIGHT, IN THEORY.

662
00:33:59,168 --> 00:34:01,669
BUT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK

663
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:05,173
AT IRENE TO SEE THAT SHE
TURNED OUT PRETTY WELL.

664
00:34:05,174 --> 00:34:09,678
YES, SHE'S A LOVELY YOUNG LADY.

665
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:31,201
IRENE.

666
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:34,704
IRENE!

667
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:36,706
SHE SEEMED TO HAVE A LOVELY TIME
TONIGHT, DON'T YOU THINK?

668
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:39,709
YEAH, I THOUGHT SO.

669
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,212
DO YOU THINK MY ARGUMENT
WITH HARRY UPSET HER?

670
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:47,218
ACTUALLY, SHE SEEMED
RATHER USED TO IT.

671
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:54,219
OH, I SUPPOSE SHE IS.
I SUPPOSE EVERYBODY IS.

672
00:34:56,228 --> 00:35:01,232
I GUESS WHAT I'M REALLY ASKING
IS IF IT UPSET YOU.

673
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:09,735
IT'S ALWAYS DISTURBING
TO WITNESS AN ARGUMENT.

674
00:35:10,243 --> 00:35:16,248
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT INVOLVES
SOMEONE YOU ADMIRE.

675
00:35:16,249 --> 00:35:20,252
AND YOU CAN ADMIRE SOMEONE
WHO BRAWLS WITH HER HUSBAND IN PUBLIC?

676
00:35:20,253 --> 00:35:23,255
ARE YOU BEGGING THE COMPLIMENT?

677
00:35:23,256 --> 00:35:29,262
YES. PLEASE--
ELABORATE.

678
00:35:29,263 --> 00:35:33,766
ALL RIGHT.

679
00:35:33,767 --> 00:35:40,273
YOUR FEELINGS TOWARDS YOUR
HUSBAND DON'T CONCERN ME.

680
00:35:40,274 --> 00:35:45,279
I FIND YOU TO BE A VERY
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN

681
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,783
WITH STRONG CHARACTER.

682
00:35:49,784 --> 00:35:52,786
IS THAT A LINE THAT WORKS
OFTEN IN YOUR TRAVELS?

683
00:35:52,787 --> 00:35:55,289
I DON'T HAVE MUCH
OCCASION TO USE IT.

684
00:35:55,290 --> 00:36:02,291
OH, I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

685
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,302
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED ME
TO BE FRANK.

686
00:36:07,303 --> 00:36:10,805
I DO. I DID. I GUESS I'M
JUST NOT VERY COMFORTABLE

687
00:36:10,806 --> 00:36:14,809
WITH YOUR FEELINGS OR MINE.

688
00:36:25,822 --> 00:36:29,825
I HAVEN'T FLIRTED
WITH A MAN IN YEARS.

689
00:36:29,826 --> 00:36:33,329
MY RESPONSES ARE THOSE
OF A COQUETTE FROM ANOTHER ERA.

690
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:36,832
I HAVE SEEN WOMAN
OUTSIDE MY MARRIAGE.

691
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:39,835
BUT MY MARRIAGE IS NOT
A HAPPY ONE.

692
00:36:39,836 --> 00:36:46,837
SUPPOSE THAT'S WHY
YOU WANT TO GET LAID.

693
00:36:49,347 --> 00:36:56,347
I'M SORRY, I'VE DONE IT AGAIN.
IT'S JUST A DEFENSE MECHANISM.

694
00:36:57,855 --> 00:36:59,857
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

695
00:36:59,858 --> 00:37:04,362
IT SOUNDS LIKE A CLICHE USED
BY ANY MAN ON THE MAKE.

696
00:37:04,363 --> 00:37:08,366
BUT IT HAPPENS TO BE TRUE.

697
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:09,867
I'M A LONELY MAN
IN A BAD MARRIAGE.

698
00:37:09,868 --> 00:37:13,371
PLEASE, I SAID I WAS SORRY.

699
00:37:13,372 --> 00:37:17,375
AND I ASSURE YOU, PICKING UP
WOMEN FOR SEXUAL PURPOSES

700
00:37:17,376 --> 00:37:24,377
IS NEVER THIS SOUL WRENCHING
OR TIME CONSUMING.

701
00:37:25,385 --> 00:37:28,387
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
TO APOLOGIZE, THANK YOU,

702
00:37:28,388 --> 00:37:31,890
OR BE INSULTED.

703
00:37:38,899 --> 00:37:45,899
WHAT I'M SAYING IS,
THIS IS NOT JUST A SEXUAL THING.

704
00:37:47,408 --> 00:37:50,910
DO YOU REALIZE THAT?

705
00:37:50,911 --> 00:37:54,914
HM?

706
00:37:54,915 --> 00:37:57,918
AND IS THE FEELING MUTUAL?

707
00:37:57,919 --> 00:38:03,924
IS IT?

708
00:38:03,925 --> 00:38:10,431
OKAY.
OKAY.

709
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:17,433
SO WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO?

710
00:38:18,441 --> 00:38:22,444
GO HOME?

711
00:38:28,451 --> 00:38:35,452
I'M REALLY JUST A GOOD GIRL
WHO'S MORE COMFORTABLE FIGHTING

712
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:40,963
WITH HER HUSBAND
THAN CHEATING ON HIM.

713
00:38:40,964 --> 00:38:44,967
I GUESS I'D RATHER BE A BITCH
THAN A SLUT.

714
00:38:44,968 --> 00:38:46,969
DOES CARING FOR SOMEONE
MAKE YOU A SLUT?

715
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:53,476
NO.

716
00:38:53,477 --> 00:38:57,481
EXPRESSING IT DOES.

717
00:39:29,014 --> 00:39:33,018
WE COULD SHARE A CAB.

718
00:39:33,019 --> 00:39:36,522
WOULD YOU MIND DROPPING ME
AT MY PLACE?

719
00:39:36,523 --> 00:39:39,525
I INSIST ON IT.

720
00:39:57,545 --> 00:40:01,047
DON'T BE AFRAID.

721
00:40:01,048 --> 00:40:05,552
I'M NOT,

722
00:40:05,553 --> 00:40:10,056
BUT I AM AFRAID.

723
00:40:44,093 --> 00:40:46,595
MY GOD, WE'VE BEEN CALLING
FOR YOU EVERYWHERE.

724
00:40:46,596 --> 00:40:47,596
WHY, WHAT'S WRONG?
WHERE'S ANDREW?

725
00:40:47,597 --> 00:40:49,599
HE'S AT THE HOSPITAL.

726
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,600
WHAT HAPPENED?
IS HE HURT?

727
00:40:50,601 --> 00:40:54,103
IT'S IRENE, A DRUG OVERDOSE.

728
00:40:54,104 --> 00:40:56,605
WHAT?
OH NO! OH MY GOD!

729
00:41:04,114 --> 00:41:06,115
SHE COULD HAVE DIED.

730
00:41:06,116 --> 00:41:08,618
FOR GOD'S SAKE,
NOBODY WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE.

731
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:10,621
SHE COULD HAVE DIED ALL ALONE
WITH STRANGERS AROUND HER.

732
00:41:10,622 --> 00:41:11,622
IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW
WE'RE HERE NOW.

733
00:41:11,623 --> 00:41:13,624
WHAT HAPPENED,
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?

734
00:41:13,625 --> 00:41:14,625
SHE'S FINE NOW.
SHE'S RESTING.

735
00:41:14,626 --> 00:41:15,626
WHERE IS SHE?

736
00:41:15,627 --> 00:41:17,127
WHERE WERE YOU?

737
00:41:17,128 --> 00:41:18,128
I WAS STILL AT THE COLLEGE,
I TOLD YOU TO I HAD TO CLEAN UP.

738
00:41:18,129 --> 00:41:19,630
FOR TWO HOURS?

739
00:41:19,631 --> 00:41:22,633
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?
WE'RE ALL HERE NOW.

740
00:41:22,634 --> 00:41:24,134
SHE'S IN THERE, THE OTHER NURSE
IS GIVING HER SOME MEDICATION.

741
00:41:24,135 --> 00:41:25,135
HAVE YOU SEEN HER YET?

742
00:41:25,136 --> 00:41:27,137
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

743
00:41:27,138 --> 00:41:29,140
WHAT, WHAT, WHY CAN'T
I SEE HER?

744
00:41:29,141 --> 00:41:31,643
JUST A FEW MINUTES.
LET HER GET SETTLED.

745
00:41:31,644 --> 00:41:33,144
WE SAW HER BEFORE IN EMERGENCY
BEFORE THEY BROUGHT HER UP.

746
00:41:33,145 --> 00:41:35,146
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?
IS SHE IN PAIN?

747
00:41:35,147 --> 00:41:37,148
SHE COULD HAVE DIED.

748
00:41:37,149 --> 00:41:38,650
WOULD YOU STOP PUNISHING ME
AND JUST TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED?

749
00:41:38,651 --> 00:41:41,152
SHE WAS HAVING
RESPIRATORY FAILURE.

750
00:41:41,153 --> 00:41:42,654
THE DOCTOR SAID IF THEY'D FOUND
HER A FEW MINUTES LATER,

751
00:41:42,655 --> 00:41:47,159
SHE WOULD HAVE GONE
INTO CARDIAC ARREST.

752
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,661
OKAY.
WHO FOUND HER?

753
00:41:48,662 --> 00:41:51,664
I DID.

754
00:41:51,665 --> 00:41:53,666
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT HER
GETTING HOME ALL RIGHT AFTER

755
00:41:53,667 --> 00:41:57,169
THE PARTY, SO I FOLLOWED HER
TO YOUR APARTMENT AND--

756
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:59,672
SHE COLLAPSED BY THE ELEVATOR--
IF DAVID HADN'T FOUND HER...

757
00:41:59,673 --> 00:42:04,176
WHAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED IT?
WHAT WAS IT?

758
00:42:04,177 --> 00:42:09,683
SHE TOLD THE DOCTOR
IT WAS CRYSTAL METH, SPEED.

759
00:42:09,684 --> 00:42:11,685
WHAT?

760
00:42:11,686 --> 00:42:13,186
MAYBE SHE WAS EXPERIMENTING.

761
00:42:13,187 --> 00:42:17,190
MAYBE SHE USED IT TO STUDY
FOR EXAMS.

762
00:42:17,191 --> 00:42:19,192
SHE'S BEEN MAIN LINING IT
FOR SOME TIME NOW.

763
00:42:19,193 --> 00:42:21,194
SHE HAS NEEDLE MARKS
ON BOTH HER ARMS.

764
00:42:21,195 --> 00:42:22,696
NO, ANDREW,
I WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT.

765
00:42:22,697 --> 00:42:24,197
WE SAW THEM, MARCIA.

766
00:42:24,198 --> 00:42:25,198
SHE'S ALL RIGHT NOW.

767
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:27,201
THE IMPORTANT THING
IS SHE GOT HERE IN TIME.

768
00:42:27,202 --> 00:42:30,204
THANK YOU, VINCENT.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

769
00:42:30,205 --> 00:42:31,205
AND THANK YOU, DAVID,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

770
00:42:31,206 --> 00:42:32,707
YES, THANK YOU, DAVID.

771
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:36,210
PLEASE--I'M JUST SO
GRATEFUL I WAS THERE.

772
00:42:40,716 --> 00:42:41,716
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?

773
00:42:41,717 --> 00:42:43,718
YES, AND SHE LIKE TO SEE YOU,

774
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:45,721
BUT NO MORE THAN TWO
AT A TIME PLEASE.

775
00:42:45,722 --> 00:42:47,723
FOR JUST A FEW MINUTES.

776
00:42:47,724 --> 00:42:51,226
OLGA, YOU GO WITH HER.

777
00:42:51,227 --> 00:42:52,728
CAN SHE COME HOME
WITH US TONIGHT?

778
00:42:52,729 --> 00:42:54,730
THE DOCTOR WOULD LIKE
TO KEEP HER OVERNIGHT.

779
00:42:54,731 --> 00:42:58,233
OKAY.

780
00:43:01,738 --> 00:43:06,242
OH, MY DARLING.

781
00:43:08,746 --> 00:43:14,250
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

782
00:43:14,251 --> 00:43:15,752
I'M SORRY.

783
00:43:15,753 --> 00:43:22,753
NO, SHHH.
JUST RELAX.

784
00:43:24,763 --> 00:43:28,766
AFTER A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP,
YOU'LL BE JUST FINE.

785
00:43:28,767 --> 00:43:35,272
"SLEEP THAT KNITS UP
THE RAVELED SLEEVE OF CARE."

786
00:43:35,273 --> 00:43:41,278
OH, I GOT YOUR TOOTHBRUSH
DOWNSTAIRS.

787
00:43:47,286 --> 00:43:50,288
THANK YOU.

788
00:43:59,799 --> 00:44:01,300
WHY HAVEN'T YOU ASKED ME
WHAT HAPPENED?

789
00:44:01,301 --> 00:44:03,302
DAVID TOLD US.

790
00:44:03,303 --> 00:44:06,806
DAVID?
WHAT DOES DAVID KNOW?

791
00:44:06,807 --> 00:44:11,310
WELL, HE FOLLOWED YOU HOME
TO MAKE SURE YOU WERE ALL RIGHT,

792
00:44:11,311 --> 00:44:13,312
AND WHEN YOU COLLAPSED
IN THE LOBBY, HE AND THE BUILDING MANAGER--

793
00:44:13,313 --> 00:44:16,816
DAVID WAS FOLLOWING ME?

794
00:44:16,817 --> 00:44:18,317
THAT'S WEIRD.

795
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:19,819
HE HELPED YOU DARLING.
YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL.

796
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,823
YES, I AM GRATEFUL
AND SURPRISED.

797
00:44:22,824 --> 00:44:24,825
DAVID TAKES A BROTHERLY
INTEREST IN YOU.

798
00:44:24,826 --> 00:44:26,326
HE CONSIDERS HIMSELF
ONE OF THE FAMILY.

799
00:44:26,327 --> 00:44:28,829
I HAVE A FAMILY
AND I DON'T NEED A CHAPERONE.

800
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:30,831
APPARENTLY, YOU DO.

801
00:44:30,832 --> 00:44:33,834
NO, I DON'T.

802
00:44:33,835 --> 00:44:36,837
WHAT I DO ALONE IS MY BUSINESS.

803
00:44:36,838 --> 00:44:39,841
THAT IS A STUPID
AND CHILDISH THING TO SAY.

804
00:44:39,842 --> 00:44:45,346
APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR FOR SOMEONE
WHO'S TREATED LIKE A CHILD.

805
00:44:45,347 --> 00:44:51,352
I'M LYING IN THE HOSPITAL
AFTER A DRUG OVERDOSE.

806
00:44:51,353 --> 00:44:55,356
YOU HAND ME A TOOTHBRUSH.

807
00:44:55,357 --> 00:44:55,857
AND WHEN I ASK YOU IF YOU WANT
TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED,

808
00:44:55,858 --> 00:44:58,861
YOU SAY DAVID TOLD YOU.

809
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,863
WHAT DO YOU THINK DAVID KNOWS
ABOUT MY LIFE?

810
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,364
WHY DON'T YOU ASK ME?

811
00:45:02,365 --> 00:45:03,866
I DIDN'T WANT TO UPSET YOU.

812
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,368
YOU NEVER WANT TO UPSET ME.

813
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:08,871
ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO READ YOUR MIND?

814
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:11,373
YOU KNOW YOU CAN TALK TO US
ABOUT ANYTHING.

815
00:45:11,374 --> 00:45:13,375
AS LONG AS IT FEEDS THE PERCEPTION
OF ME THAT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH.

816
00:45:13,376 --> 00:45:14,877
IS THIS SOMEHOW OUR FAULT?
IS THAT IT?

817
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,881
NO.

818
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:23,386
NO.

819
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:26,389
IT'S MY FAULT I'M ON DRUGS.

820
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,891
YOU'RE NOT.

821
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:32,896
IT'S YOUR FAULT
YOU CAN'T ACCEPT IT.

822
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:36,399
SHH, STOP OKAY.
YOU'RE JUST TIRED.

823
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,404
DO YOU SEE?

824
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:42,907
YOU'LL BE TELLING PEOPLE
I HAD A LITTLE FAINTING SPELL

825
00:45:42,908 --> 00:45:47,912
LIKE SOME OVERWROUGHT
SOUTHERN LADY.

826
00:45:47,913 --> 00:45:49,914
WHERE IS SHE?

827
00:45:49,915 --> 00:45:51,415
SHE'S ALL RIGHT, SHE'S IN THERE
WITH OLGA AND MARCIA.

828
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:53,918
SHE JUST NEEDS SOME REST.

829
00:45:53,919 --> 00:45:55,419
DR., I DIDN'T MEAN FOR YOU
TO COME TO THE HOSPITAL.

830
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,421
I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR MARCIA.

831
00:45:56,422 --> 00:45:57,422
HOW COULD I NOT COME?

832
00:45:57,423 --> 00:45:58,924
SO, WHAT HAPPENED?

833
00:45:58,925 --> 00:46:02,427
SHE OVERDOSED ON CRYSTAL METH.

834
00:46:02,428 --> 00:46:04,930
APPARENTLY IT WAS ACCIDENTAL.

835
00:46:04,931 --> 00:46:08,433
YEAH, TELL THAT ONE
TO DR. FREUD.

836
00:46:08,434 --> 00:46:13,438
YOU CAN'T CONTROL YOUR SARCASM
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, CAN YOU?

837
00:46:13,439 --> 00:46:15,942
GEE DAVE, I HATE TO SHATTER
YOUR NORMAN ROCKWELL VIEW

838
00:46:15,943 --> 00:46:17,443
OF THE WORLD, BUT PEOPLE WHO
DRUG THEMSELVES TO OVERDOSE

839
00:46:17,444 --> 00:46:19,445
ARE TRYING TO KILL THEMSELVES.

840
00:46:19,446 --> 00:46:21,948
AND WHO ARE YOU TO ASSIGN
MOTIVES TO HER.

841
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:24,450
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT HER?

842
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:26,452
MORE THAN YOU COULD HANDLE.

843
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:28,955
EVERYTHING SEEMS WARPED
FROM WHERE YOU STAND,

844
00:46:28,956 --> 00:46:29,956
BUT THE DISTORTION
IS INTERNAL, NOT EXTERNAL.

845
00:46:29,957 --> 00:46:31,958
STOP ARGUING.

846
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:35,462
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU TWO?
YOU'RE GOOD FRIENDS FOR GOD'S SAKE.

847
00:46:35,463 --> 00:46:37,464
YOU'RE BOTH TIRED AND UPSET.

848
00:46:37,465 --> 00:46:41,468
IS THAT WHAT IT IS?

849
00:46:41,469 --> 00:46:43,971
HOW'D SHE GET HERE?

850
00:46:43,972 --> 00:46:46,974
DAVID FOUND HER IN HER APARTMENT
LOBBY AND CALLED THE PARAMEDICS.

851
00:46:46,975 --> 00:46:50,477
WHAT WAS DAVID DOING
IN HER APARTMENT LOBBY?

852
00:46:50,478 --> 00:46:52,479
I WALKED HER HOME.

853
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,982
SHE LEFT THE PARTY BY HERSELF--

854
00:46:53,983 --> 00:46:56,484
AND I FOLLOWED HER TO MAKE SURE
SHE WAS ALL RIGHT.

855
00:46:56,485 --> 00:46:59,988
WHAT, DO YOU HAVE SOME
SIXTH SENSE ABOUT POTENTIAL DRUG OVERDOSES?

856
00:46:59,989 --> 00:47:02,490
LOOKING AFTER SOMEONE MUST BE AN
INCOMPREHENSIBLE CONCEPT TO YOU.

857
00:47:02,491 --> 00:47:04,492
DON'T DIGNIFY YOUR PERVERSIONS
TO ME, YOU CREEP.

858
00:47:04,493 --> 00:47:05,493
HEY.

859
00:47:05,494 --> 00:47:06,494
HEY, HEY, HEY!

860
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,997
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!

861
00:47:08,998 --> 00:47:12,500
PLEASE.

862
00:47:17,007 --> 00:47:21,010
UH, I'M GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU
TO LEAVE, GARY.

863
00:47:21,011 --> 00:47:24,013
OH REALLY, ANDREW?

864
00:47:24,014 --> 00:47:30,019
WHAT ARE YOU THE HOSPITAL
BOUNCER NOW?

865
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:33,023
ANDREW? ANDREW,
WHAT'S GOING ON OUT HERE?

866
00:47:33,024 --> 00:47:35,025
NOTHING.
DR. CHEBRIN AND GARY ARRIVED.

867
00:47:35,026 --> 00:47:35,525
EVERYONE'S VERY CONCERNED
ABOUT IRENE.

868
00:47:35,526 --> 00:47:37,027
HOW IS SHE?

869
00:47:37,028 --> 00:47:39,029
DR. CHEBRIN, SHE'S ALL RIGHT,
THANK YOU.

870
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:41,031
I THINK IT WAS THE PRESSURE
OF FINALS.

871
00:47:41,032 --> 00:47:42,532
I THINK SHE WAS JUST TRYING
TO RELEASE THE PRESSURE.

872
00:47:42,533 --> 00:47:45,035
ARE YOU A SPIN DOCTOR NOW?

873
00:47:45,036 --> 00:47:46,036
TAKING IMAGE CONSULTING
FROM MR. ANTONELLI HERE--

874
00:47:46,037 --> 00:47:48,038
WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?

875
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:50,540
EXCUSE ME, LADIES.

876
00:47:50,541 --> 00:47:52,543
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TO DISTORT
THINGS FOR OUR FRIENDS, OLGA.

877
00:47:52,544 --> 00:47:55,546
YEAH, WE'RE ALL FAMILY HERE.

878
00:47:55,547 --> 00:48:00,551
EVEN MR. ANTONELLI KNEW YOU AS CHILDREN
AND HE'S GOTTEN MUCH CLOSER THIS EVENING.

879
00:48:05,057 --> 00:48:07,058
EXCUSE ME, IRENE PRIOR.

880
00:48:07,059 --> 00:48:07,558
HER FAMILY'S
IN THE WAITING ROOM THERE.

881
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:11,063
THANKS.

882
00:48:11,064 --> 00:48:12,064
IS SHE ALL RIGHT.

883
00:48:12,065 --> 00:48:14,066
SHE'S RESTING.

884
00:48:14,067 --> 00:48:15,567
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED
FOR GOD'S SAKE.

885
00:48:15,568 --> 00:48:18,570
SHE OVERDOSED ON CRYSTAL METH.
DAVID FOUND HER.

886
00:48:18,571 --> 00:48:20,072
AFTER LURKING ABOUT
FOR A FEW HOURS--

887
00:48:20,073 --> 00:48:22,074
WOULD YOU SHUT UP.

888
00:48:22,075 --> 00:48:25,577
--WAITING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO
ASSERT HIS FRAGILE MASCULINITY.

889
00:48:25,578 --> 00:48:28,080
HAVE YOU BOTH GONE CRAZY?

890
00:48:28,081 --> 00:48:30,083
HE SAYS THAT TO EVERYONE HOPING
TO INCREASE HIS BUSINESS.

891
00:48:30,084 --> 00:48:32,085
EVERYONE'S NERVES ARE A LITTLE
FRAYED THAT'S ALL.

892
00:48:32,086 --> 00:48:33,586
YEAH, THIS ONE'S OUT OF HIS
FUCKING MIND TONIGHT.

893
00:48:33,587 --> 00:48:36,089
SHE OVERDOSED, DAVID FOUND HER,
THAT'S IT?

894
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:37,590
YOU GET HERE LATE,
YOU GET A SHORT SYNOPSIS.

895
00:48:37,591 --> 00:48:39,592
THE HEART OF CONCERN.

896
00:48:39,593 --> 00:48:41,594
I'M ASKING ABOUT
YOUR GOD DAMN SISTER.

897
00:48:41,595 --> 00:48:45,098
PLEASE DON'T START THIS HERE.

898
00:48:45,099 --> 00:48:47,600
YOU LEFT MY GOD DAMN SISTER'S PARTY
TO GO TO THE GOD DAMN WALDEMAN'S.

899
00:48:47,601 --> 00:48:49,603
SO DON'T COME STROLLING IN HERE
AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR

900
00:48:49,604 --> 00:48:52,606
WITH YOUR PROFESSIONAL ARROGANCE
AND YOUR RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION

901
00:48:52,607 --> 00:48:56,610
EXPECTING ORAL REPORTS
FROM ALL THE LAYPERSONS.

902
00:48:56,611 --> 00:49:01,615
YOU'RE NOT THE DOCTOR HERE, HARRY,
ONLY ANOTHER GUY WHO MISSED THE SHOW.

903
00:49:01,616 --> 00:49:05,119
MARCIA WAS A LITTLE LATE HERSELF
IF THAT MAKES YOU FEEL ANY BETTER.

904
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,121
NOT AS GOOD AS IT MAKES
YOU FEEL.

905
00:49:07,122 --> 00:49:09,624
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING
TO SEE MY SISTER.

906
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:10,125
IS SHE STILL AWAKE?

907
00:49:10,126 --> 00:49:11,626
YEAH.

908
00:49:11,627 --> 00:49:13,628
EVERYBODY ON THIS FLOOR'S
AWAKE NOW.

909
00:49:13,629 --> 00:49:15,130
DO YOU WANT TO COME
WITH ME, DOCTOR?

910
00:49:15,131 --> 00:49:18,133
OH, HE'S HALF ASLEEP AND HALF
DRUNK; THAT'S ALL SHE NEEDS.

911
00:49:18,134 --> 00:49:20,135
REALLY, GARY, IS NO ONE EXEMPT
FROM THESE LITTLE CA-CAS

912
00:49:20,136 --> 00:49:21,636
YOU SEEM COMPELLED
TO MAKE IN PUBLIC.

913
00:49:21,637 --> 00:49:24,139
JUST GIVE HER SOME PRIVACY,
THAT'S ALL.

914
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:28,644
NANCE?
DOCTOR?

915
00:49:28,645 --> 00:49:31,647
I--I'LL STAY OUT HERE.
JUST GIVE HER MY LOVE.

916
00:49:31,648 --> 00:49:34,650
ALL RIGHT.

917
00:49:34,651 --> 00:49:37,153
OH, HARRY.
THIS IS VINCENT ANTONELLI.

918
00:49:37,154 --> 00:49:40,656
HE'S A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY.

919
00:49:53,171 --> 00:49:55,172
FEELING ANY BETTER?

920
00:49:55,173 --> 00:49:57,174
YEAH.

921
00:49:57,175 --> 00:50:00,177
OH GOD, WE WERE SO WORRIED
ABOUT YOU, BUT YOU LOOK GREAT.

922
00:50:00,178 --> 00:50:02,179
REALLY GREAT.

923
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:04,181
I MEAN YOU'RE A LITTLE PALE,

924
00:50:04,182 --> 00:50:06,686
BUT YOU'RE GONNA BE OUT
OF HERE TOMORROW AND

925
00:50:06,687 --> 00:50:09,187
THEN YOU ARE GONNA
FEEL, YOU KNOW, GREAT.

926
00:50:09,188 --> 00:50:11,689
THANKS, NANCY.

927
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:14,192
CAN WE GET YOU ANYTHING?

928
00:50:14,193 --> 00:50:16,194
NO. THANK YOU.

929
00:50:16,195 --> 00:50:19,697
WELL MY DARLING, I THINK
I'LL GO HOME.

930
00:50:19,698 --> 00:50:21,699
WHAT GOOD IS AN OLD MAN
IN A CRISIS.

931
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,701
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING.

932
00:50:23,702 --> 00:50:26,205
IT'LL MEAN SO MUCH TO IRENE
TO KNOW YOU WERE HERE.

933
00:50:26,206 --> 00:50:28,207
WHO KNOWS ANYTHING?

934
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:30,709
THIS WHOLE THING
MAY HAVE BEEN A DREAM.

935
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:34,713
WE MAY ALL WAKE UP TOMORROW
HAVING HAD THE SAME BAD DREAM.

936
00:50:34,714 --> 00:50:37,216
APPARENTLY METAPHYSICS ARE GOING
TO SAVE US FROM THIS ONE.

937
00:50:37,217 --> 00:50:39,218
CAN I WALK YOU DOWNSTAIRS,
DOCTOR?

938
00:50:39,219 --> 00:50:41,220
HE'S GOOD AT THAT.

939
00:50:41,221 --> 00:50:48,222
UH, NO THANK YOU MY BOY.
I GET IN AN ELEVATOR.

940
00:50:48,229 --> 00:50:52,732
I GET IN A CAB.
I CAN HANDLE THAT.

941
00:50:52,733 --> 00:50:56,236
YOU'RE MOTHER MUST HAVE DROPPED
YOU WHEN YOU WERE A BABY,

942
00:50:56,237 --> 00:50:59,739
AND SOMETHING BROKE IN HERE.

943
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:06,741
THOUGH NEVER LITERALLY,
I'VE BEEN DROPPED A FEW TIMES, DOCTOR.

944
00:51:09,751 --> 00:51:13,754
IT SHOWS.

945
00:51:13,755 --> 00:51:16,757
GOODNIGHT.
GOODNIGHT. GOODNIGHT.

946
00:51:26,269 --> 00:51:27,269
HOW MUCH LONGER ARE YOU GOING
TO STAY?

947
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:28,770
I DON'T KNOW.

948
00:51:28,771 --> 00:51:30,772
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
IN FACT, PLEASE DON'T.

949
00:51:30,773 --> 00:51:35,277
I DON'T WANT YOU LEAVING HERE
ALONE AT A LATE HOUR.

950
00:51:35,278 --> 00:51:37,279
OH, PLEASE--
ALL THIS OBLIGATORY GALLANTRY IS TIRESOME.

951
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:43,286
YOU KNOW I CAN TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF.

952
00:51:43,287 --> 00:51:47,290
WHAT I KNOW IS THAT YOUR
DEFENSIVE SKILLS ARE MOSTLY VERBAL.

953
00:51:47,291 --> 00:51:49,292
ANDREW AND I WILL DROP HER OFF.

954
00:51:49,293 --> 00:51:53,796
OR I'D BE HAPPY TO SEE HER HOME.

955
00:51:53,797 --> 00:52:00,798
I SEE.

956
00:52:01,306 --> 00:52:06,310
WHAT BETTER PROTECTION
THAN NOSTALGIA PERSONIFIED.

957
00:52:06,311 --> 00:52:07,811
GOODNIGHT.

958
00:52:07,812 --> 00:52:11,314
GOODNIGHT.

959
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:16,320
ANDREW, YOU KNOW WHAT
I WOULD LIKE?

960
00:52:16,321 --> 00:52:18,822
WHAT? YOU TELL ME;
I'LL CALL THE NURSE.

961
00:52:18,823 --> 00:52:22,327
NO, SHE CAN'T GIVE IT TO ME.

962
00:52:22,328 --> 00:52:24,829
I WANT TO GO BACK TO CHARLESTON
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

963
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:27,332
ALL OF US.

964
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:30,335
SPEND SOME TIME IN THE HOUSE,
INHABIT OUR OLD SPACE,

965
00:52:30,336 --> 00:52:32,337
FIND OUR OLD SOULS.

966
00:52:32,338 --> 00:52:36,341
YOU THINK WE COULD DO THAT?

967
00:52:36,342 --> 00:52:40,346
SURE, I THINK WE COULD, YEAH.

968
00:52:40,347 --> 00:52:43,349
THE CURRENT LEASE IS UP
ON THE HOUSE IN A FEW MONTHS

969
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:48,354
AND AS SOON AS THE TENANTS ARE
OUT, WE COULD FLY DOWN, YEAH.

970
00:52:48,355 --> 00:52:52,358
OR MAYBE WE COULD DRIVE DOWN
AND SEE THE COUNTRYSIDE.

971
00:52:52,359 --> 00:52:55,361
OH, I'D LIKE THAT--
SEE THE LEAVES CHANGING.

972
00:52:55,362 --> 00:52:58,365
STOP AT FARMERS' MARKETS
AND ANTIQUE SHOPS ALONG THE WAY.

973
00:52:58,366 --> 00:53:01,868
SOUNDS LOVELY.

974
00:53:01,869 --> 00:53:05,872
WE'LL MAKE ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS
WHEN YOU FEEL BETTER.

975
00:53:05,873 --> 00:53:07,374
YOU GET SOME REST NOW.

976
00:53:07,375 --> 00:53:12,879
I DON'T WANT TO KEEP YOU UP,
SO WE'RE GOING TO GO.

977
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,882
WOULD YOU LIKE DAVID TO COME IN
BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP

978
00:53:15,883 --> 00:53:16,884
JUST SO THAT YOU
COULD THANK HIM?

979
00:53:16,885 --> 00:53:20,388
OH.

980
00:53:20,389 --> 00:53:22,390
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

981
00:53:22,391 --> 00:53:26,394
NO.
I--I SHOULD.

982
00:53:26,395 --> 00:53:29,897
YEAH, PLEASE ASK HIM TO COME IN.

983
00:53:29,898 --> 00:53:34,402
ALL RIGHT.
GOODNIGHT.

984
00:53:34,403 --> 00:53:38,407
YOU'LL BE MY SHINY NEW PENNY
IN THE MORNING AGAIN.

985
00:53:38,408 --> 00:53:40,409
THANK YOU.

986
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:42,411
YES, GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP
AND THEN EVERYTHING WILL BE--

987
00:53:42,412 --> 00:53:46,415
I KNOW--
"GREAT."

988
00:53:46,416 --> 00:53:50,419
YEAH.

989
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:54,423
OKAY.

990
00:54:00,431 --> 00:54:01,431
I NEED TO GO CALL
MY WIFE AND KIDS.

991
00:54:01,432 --> 00:54:03,433
OH, VINCENT I'M SO SORRY.

992
00:54:03,434 --> 00:54:05,435
HOW INSENSITIVE OF ME.

993
00:54:05,436 --> 00:54:07,437
YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY HERE
WITH ME.

994
00:54:07,438 --> 00:54:10,940
I KNOW, YOU'RE SELF-SUFFICIENT.
I'LL BE DOWNSTAIRS.

995
00:54:20,952 --> 00:54:26,957
UH, IRENE WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU
FOR A MOMENT, DAVID.

996
00:54:42,975 --> 00:54:46,478
THAT GUY GIVES ME THE CREEPS.

997
00:54:46,479 --> 00:54:48,480
HE JUST HAS A HARD TIME
EXPRESSING HIMSELF.

998
00:54:48,481 --> 00:54:51,983
HE EXPRESSES HIMSELF TOO WELL,
IF YOU ASK ME.

999
00:54:58,492 --> 00:55:00,493
IT'S OKAY, DAVID.
YOU CAN COME IN.

1000
00:55:00,494 --> 00:55:02,495
HOW ARE YOU?

1001
00:55:02,496 --> 00:55:08,501
I'M ALL RIGHT NOW.
PLEASE COME IN.

1002
00:55:14,008 --> 00:55:19,012
DAVID, WHAT'S WRONG?

1003
00:55:19,013 --> 00:55:25,518
I WAS JUST--
SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

1004
00:55:43,539 --> 00:55:47,041
THERE WAS AN INCIDENT,
I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO IT.

1005
00:55:47,042 --> 00:55:49,043
HELEN, HELEN--
I CALLED AS SOON AS I COULD.

1006
00:55:49,044 --> 00:55:50,546
WHAT WAS WITH
THAT ROADTRIP CRAP?

1007
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:52,548
SHE'S JUST FEELING
A LITTLE SENTIMENTAL.

1008
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:54,550
MENTAL IS MORE LIKE IT.

1009
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:57,052
I MEAN, IMAGINE BEING IN A CAR
WITH YOUR SISTERS

1010
00:55:57,053 --> 00:56:00,556
ALL THE WAY TO CHARLESTON.
SOMEBODY WOULD GET THERE DOA.

1011
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:06,061
HELEN, I HAVE TO GO NOW, OKAY?
JUST TELL THE GIRLS I LOVE THEM.

1012
00:56:13,571 --> 00:56:16,573
WHY WOULD SHE DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT?

1013
00:56:16,574 --> 00:56:19,576
AND HOW COULD WE NOT KNOW
ABOUT IT?

1014
00:56:19,577 --> 00:56:22,078
WE ALL CARRY OUR SECRETS,
I GUESS.

1015
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:27,083
DON'T WE HAVE SECRETS FROM HER?

1016
00:56:27,084 --> 00:56:28,586
YOU?
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SECRETS.

1017
00:56:28,587 --> 00:56:29,587
YOU TELL EVERYBODY EVERYTHING.

1018
00:56:29,588 --> 00:56:32,089
RIGHT.

1019
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:32,590
LOOK, IF THERE'S MORE.
I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT.

1020
00:56:32,591 --> 00:56:36,594
I KNOW.
YOU NEVER DID.

1021
00:56:36,595 --> 00:56:38,596
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

1022
00:56:38,597 --> 00:56:43,100
NOTHING.

1023
00:56:43,101 --> 00:56:44,101
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE
YOU UNCOMFORTABLE.

1024
00:56:44,102 --> 00:56:47,606
I KNOW HOW YOU HATE THAT.

1025
00:56:47,607 --> 00:56:50,108
OH.
PLEASE CONTINUE.

1026
00:56:50,109 --> 00:56:52,110
DON'T SPARE ME.

1027
00:56:52,111 --> 00:56:54,613
TELL ME HOW I'M RESPONSIBLE
FOR YOUR PSYCHOLOGICAL TURMOIL,

1028
00:56:54,614 --> 00:56:55,614
YOUR BAD MARRIAGE.

1029
00:56:55,615 --> 00:56:58,116
IT'S NOT WHAT DO YOU THINK.

1030
00:56:58,117 --> 00:57:00,118
I DON'T NEED THIS.

1031
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:01,620
GO HOME AND DO THIS
WITH YOUR HUSBAND.

1032
00:57:01,621 --> 00:57:03,121
YOU'D LIKE THAT, WOULDN'T YOU?

1033
00:57:03,122 --> 00:57:04,122
YOU PROBABLY THOUGHT
WHEN I MARRIED HIM

1034
00:57:04,123 --> 00:57:06,124
THAT IT WOULD SOLVE
ALL OUR PROBLEMS.

1035
00:57:06,125 --> 00:57:10,630
OUR PROBLEMS?

1036
00:57:10,631 --> 00:57:14,133
WHAT FATHER DID TO ME
IS YOUR PROBLEM, TOO, OLGA.

1037
00:57:14,134 --> 00:57:16,636
AND IN SOME STRANGE WAY, I THINK
IT'S EVEN BECOME IRENE'S.

1038
00:57:16,637 --> 00:57:19,138
WELL, IF SPEWING VITRIOL
FOR ETERNITY

1039
00:57:19,139 --> 00:57:21,140
IS YOUR WAY OF COMING TO TERMS
WITH WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU,

1040
00:57:21,141 --> 00:57:23,643
THEN IT'S BECOME EVERYONE'S--

1041
00:57:23,644 --> 00:57:25,645
IT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED TO ME,
IT'S WHAT FATHER DID TO ME.

1042
00:57:25,646 --> 00:57:27,147
ALL RIGHT.
I ACCEPTED THAT A YEAR AGO.

1043
00:57:27,148 --> 00:57:28,649
I BELIEVED YOU
EVEN THOUGH FATHER

1044
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:32,152
WASN'T HERE TO DEFEND HIMSELF.

1045
00:57:40,662 --> 00:57:43,163
YOU INSULT ME IN SO MANY
SUBTLE WAYS

1046
00:57:43,164 --> 00:57:46,167
AS IF I WAS FATHER'S
POSTHUMOUS PERSECUTOR.

1047
00:57:46,168 --> 00:57:47,669
WHAT IS THE POINT
IN GOING OVER AND OVER AGAIN?

1048
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:49,671
IT'S NOT FINISHED.

1049
00:57:49,672 --> 00:57:51,673
IT'S NEVER FINISHED
UNTIL YOU ACCEPT IT.

1050
00:57:51,674 --> 00:57:57,178
I TOLD YOU I DID.
BUT I LOVED HIM.

1051
00:57:57,179 --> 00:58:00,181
HE WAS MY FATHER, AND HE NEVER
DID THOSE THINGS TO ME.

1052
00:58:00,182 --> 00:58:04,686
EXACTLY.

1053
00:58:05,689 --> 00:58:08,691
HE DIDN'T DO THOSE
THINGS TO YOU.

1054
00:58:08,692 --> 00:58:10,192
STOP IT NOW, MARCIA.

1055
00:58:10,193 --> 00:58:12,194
I HEAR SOMEONE, FATHER.

1056
00:58:12,195 --> 00:58:16,699
THERE IS NO ONE.
NO ONE.

1057
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,701
WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

1058
00:58:18,702 --> 00:58:21,203
IT MEANS YOU KNEW
WHAT HE WAS DOING TO ME

1059
00:58:21,204 --> 00:58:23,205
LONG BEFORE I TOLD YOU.

1060
00:58:23,206 --> 00:58:24,207
WHILE YOU WERE A CHILD,
WHILE IT WAS HAPPENING.

1061
00:58:24,208 --> 00:58:25,709
THAT IS A LIE.

1062
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,210
AND ON SOME LEVEL
YOU WERE JEALOUS.

1063
00:58:27,211 --> 00:58:28,712
AND YOU HAVE LIVED--

1064
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:29,713
YOU'RE SO TWISTED.

1065
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:32,215
YOU HAVE LIVED WITH A JEALOUSY,
AND THOSE FEELINGS

1066
00:58:32,216 --> 00:58:35,218
OF INADEQUACY FOR YEARS,
IT'S CREATED A BARRIER

1067
00:58:35,219 --> 00:58:37,721
BETWEEN YOU AND IRENE,
YOU AND ME, AND YOU AND YOURSELF.

1068
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:39,222
YOU KNOW WHAT?

1069
00:58:39,223 --> 00:58:40,724
IF VINCENT IS SEEING YOU HOME,
I MIGHT AS WELL LEAVE.

1070
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:44,228
PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE LISTEN TO ME.

1071
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:47,231
FOR IRENE, IF NOT FOR ME.

1072
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:52,236
WE REALLY HAVEN'T GIVEN HER
THE FOUNDATION SHE SPOKE OF TONIGHT.

1073
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:59,237
IT'S A QUICKSAND OF MYTHS
AND HALF-TRUTHS.

1074
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:04,750
YOU AND I HAVE LEARNED
TO LIVE WITH IT

1075
00:59:04,751 --> 00:59:10,255
WITH ENOUGH SUCCESS TO GET BY--
A BITTER FRUSTRATED WOMAN

1076
00:59:10,256 --> 00:59:17,256
EXERCISING HER DEMONS
WITH VERBAL ASSAULTS

1077
00:59:18,264 --> 00:59:23,269
AND A CLOSET LESBIAN, TRYING
TO BE THE FATHER SHE LOVED AND HATED.

1078
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:26,272
MY SEXUAL ORIENTATION
IS MY BUSINESS,

1079
00:59:26,273 --> 00:59:27,774
AS A NECESSARY SECRET
FOR A SCHOOLTEACHER.

1080
00:59:27,775 --> 00:59:30,777
YOU WANT TO THINK SO?

1081
00:59:30,778 --> 00:59:32,779
BUT WHY HAVE YOU NEVER
SHARED IT WITH IRENE,

1082
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:36,282
AND ONLY BY INFERENCE WITH ME?

1083
00:59:36,283 --> 00:59:42,289
WHY SHOULD I? WHY EXPOSE
MYSELF TO YOUR POP-PSYCHOLOGY?

1084
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:45,292
POOR OLGA HAS TO BE HER FATHER, BECAUSE
HE DIDN'T LOVE HER ENOUGH TO MOLEST HER?

1085
00:59:45,293 --> 00:59:45,793
BULLSHIT.

1086
00:59:45,794 --> 00:59:47,294
IS IT?

1087
00:59:47,295 --> 00:59:50,297
YES, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
MY COMPLEXITIES

1088
00:59:50,298 --> 00:59:53,300
ENOUGH TO ANALYZE
AND CATEGORIZE ME.

1089
00:59:53,301 --> 01:00:00,302
ALL RIGHT,
THEN SHARE THEM WITH ME.

1090
01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:02,811
LET ME SEE YOU.

1091
01:00:02,812 --> 01:00:09,317
I DON'T KNOW.

1092
01:00:09,318 --> 01:00:14,322
I DON'T KNOW
IF I TRUST YOU ENOUGH.

1093
01:00:27,838 --> 01:00:29,839
HOW IS SHE NOW, DAVID?

1094
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,842
FINE.
SHE'S GOING TO SLEEP.

1095
01:00:32,843 --> 01:00:33,342
SHOULD WE LOOK IN ON HER?

1096
01:00:33,343 --> 01:00:35,845
NO.

1097
01:00:35,846 --> 01:00:40,350
JUST LET HER REST.
WE'LL SEE HER IN THE MORNING.

1098
01:00:40,351 --> 01:00:41,852
DON'T SAY GOOD NIGHT.
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

1099
01:00:41,853 --> 01:00:45,856
I WASN'T SAYING GOOD NIGHT.

1100
01:00:52,363 --> 01:00:57,368
COME, DAVID.
LET'S GO HOME.

1101
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:39,912
I LOVE YOU.

1102
01:02:21,457 --> 01:02:27,462
WITH THIS RING AND ALL THAT I AM
AND ALL THAT I HAVE,

1103
01:02:27,463 --> 01:02:30,966
I GIVE MYSELF TO YOU.

1104
01:02:30,967 --> 01:02:35,972
ANDREW AUGUSTUS, WITH THIS RING
AND ALL THAT I AM

1105
01:02:35,973 --> 01:02:40,476
AND ALL THAT I HAVE,
I GIVE MYSELF TO YOU.

1106
01:02:40,477 --> 01:02:41,978
AS YOU HAVE PLEDGED
YOUR LIFE-LONG COMMITMENT,

1107
01:02:41,979 --> 01:02:44,480
I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU
HUSBAND AND WIFE.

1108
01:02:44,481 --> 01:02:47,984
THOSE WHOM GOD HAS JOINED
TOGETHER LET NO ONE SEPARATE.

1109
01:02:47,985 --> 01:02:51,989
ANDREW, YOU MAY KISS YOUR BRIDE.

1110
01:05:29,155 --> 01:05:31,656
UH, A MAN IN TRIBECA CUT OFF
HIS BEST FRIEND'S THUMB

1111
01:05:31,657 --> 01:05:36,661
FOR BEATING HIM
AT A GAME OF PINBALL.

1112
01:05:36,662 --> 01:05:43,662
HIS BEST FRIEND, HIS THUMB.

1113
01:05:44,671 --> 01:05:48,674
UH, A WOMAN IN RIVERDALE
WAS RAPED BY A MAN WITH WHOM

1114
01:05:48,675 --> 01:05:54,180
SHE HAD REFUSED TO GO TO THE
HIGH SCHOOL PROM 10 YEARS AGO.

1115
01:05:54,181 --> 01:05:58,684
IMAGINE CARRYING THAT KIND OF
RESENTMENT AROUND FOR 10 YEARS.

1116
01:06:04,192 --> 01:06:07,694
UHHH, THREE CARMELITE NUNS
IN BROOKLYN--

1117
01:06:07,695 --> 01:06:09,196
WOULD YOU SHUT UP?

1118
01:06:09,197 --> 01:06:12,199
HUH, WHAT?

1119
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,701
I DON'T GIVE
A CONTORTIONIST'S FUCK

1120
01:06:14,702 --> 01:06:16,703
ABOUT THREE CARMELITE NUNS
IN BROOKLYN.

1121
01:06:16,704 --> 01:06:19,206
I WASN'T EVEN
TALKING TO YOU, GARY.

1122
01:06:19,207 --> 01:06:21,208
WELL, I'M THE ONLY ONE
UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE SHARING

1123
01:06:21,209 --> 01:06:27,715
THIS ROOM WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

1124
01:06:27,716 --> 01:06:29,217
I WAS READING TO MYSELF.

1125
01:06:29,218 --> 01:06:31,719
AT 50 DECIBELS?

1126
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:33,721
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT CALLED
THE "READING OUT LOUD ROOM"

1127
01:06:33,722 --> 01:06:35,723
OR THE "ATROCITIES ROOM,"

1128
01:06:35,724 --> 01:06:39,727
IT'S CALLED THE "FACULTY LOUNGE,"
WHY DON'T YOU JUST LOUNGE.

1129
01:06:39,728 --> 01:06:43,232
WHY DON'T YOU GRADE
YOUR PAPERS IN YOUR OFFICE?

1130
01:06:43,233 --> 01:06:48,237
BECAUSE I AM NOT
DISTURBING ANYONE.

1131
01:06:48,238 --> 01:06:50,239
IF YOU HAVEN'T MASTERED
SILENT READING SKILLS,

1132
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,240
WHY DON'T YOU GO TO YOUR OFFICE?

1133
01:06:51,241 --> 01:06:54,243
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, I UNDERSTAND.

1134
01:07:06,257 --> 01:07:11,761
WHAT? WHAT EXACTLY
DO YOU UNDERSTAND, OLD MAN?

1135
01:07:11,762 --> 01:07:13,763
YOUR SHORT TEMPER
AND YOUR POOR MANNERS,

1136
01:07:13,764 --> 01:07:20,271
I SHOULD SAY SHORTER AND POORER.

1137
01:07:20,272 --> 01:07:23,774
I UNDERSTAND WHERE'S
THIS COMING FROM, "OLD MAN".

1138
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:30,775
REALLY?
ENLIGHTEN ME.

1139
01:07:34,286 --> 01:07:38,289
PERHAPS A CERTAIN JEALOUSY OVER
A CERTAIN YOUNG LADY'S INTEREST

1140
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:42,294
IN A CERTAIN OTHER YOUNG MAN.

1141
01:07:42,295 --> 01:07:46,298
OR HIS IN HER.

1142
01:07:46,299 --> 01:07:49,301
WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?
YOU STUPID OLD FOOL.

1143
01:07:49,302 --> 01:07:52,804
YOU SHIT.

1144
01:07:52,805 --> 01:07:56,308
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1145
01:07:56,309 --> 01:08:00,313
NOTHING, I JUST DROPPED A BOOK.

1146
01:08:00,314 --> 01:08:03,816
FIFTEEN-FOOT GRAVITY
DEFYING DROP.

1147
01:08:03,817 --> 01:08:07,320
I'LL BE SURE TO CALL RIPLEY'S
WHEN I GET BACK TO MY OFFICE.

1148
01:08:07,321 --> 01:08:08,821
YOU COULD HAVE KILLED ME.

1149
01:08:08,822 --> 01:08:11,824
AND WATCH YOU BECOME
ONE OF YOUR PRECIOUS HEADLINES.

1150
01:08:11,825 --> 01:08:15,328
"UH, ENGLISH PROFESSOR
KILLED  BY FLYING POLITICAL SCIENCE TEXT."

1151
01:08:15,329 --> 01:08:16,329
I WOULDN'T GIVE YOU
THE POST MORTEM SATISFACTION.

1152
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:18,332
SHEESH.

1153
01:08:18,333 --> 01:08:20,834
I'VE GOT PAPERS TO GRADE.

1154
01:08:20,835 --> 01:08:22,836
WELL, DON'T LET US
FORCE YOU OUT.

1155
01:08:22,837 --> 01:08:25,339
I WORK BETTER IN MY OFFICE.

1156
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:26,840
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU STAY
AND JOIN US.

1157
01:08:26,841 --> 01:08:28,842
WE'RE HAVING A LITTLE PARTY.

1158
01:08:28,843 --> 01:08:31,345
OH, REALLY?

1159
01:08:31,346 --> 01:08:33,347
ANOTHER SOUL STRIPPING TRIBAL
DANCE BY THE PRIOR FAMILY,

1160
01:08:33,348 --> 01:08:35,349
WHAT'S THE SPECIAL OCCASION?

1161
01:08:35,350 --> 01:08:38,353
IT'S A BABY SHOWER
FOR ANDREW AND NANCY.

1162
01:08:38,354 --> 01:08:41,356
OH GOD, HAVE THEY
PERFORMED AMNIOCENTESIS

1163
01:08:41,357 --> 01:08:43,358
TO FIND OUT WHAT SPECIES
IT'S GOING TO BE?

1164
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:46,361
MR. SOKOL, I DON'T APPRECIATE
YOU RESPONDING TO AN INVITATION

1165
01:08:46,362 --> 01:08:51,366
BY INSULTING ALL OF THE MEMBERS
OF MY FAMILY INCLUDING THE UNBORN.

1166
01:08:51,367 --> 01:08:53,368
YOU THINK BEING CHANCELLOR
ENTITLES YOU

1167
01:08:53,369 --> 01:08:56,372
TO GIVE ME LESSONS
IN DEPORTMENT?

1168
01:08:56,373 --> 01:08:58,874
YES, AND I WON'T HAVE YOU
THROWING BOOKS

1169
01:08:58,875 --> 01:09:02,878
AT OTHER TEACHERS.

1170
01:09:02,879 --> 01:09:05,381
THE FUHRER MEETS EMILY POST.

1171
01:09:05,382 --> 01:09:09,385
HEIL!

1172
01:09:09,386 --> 01:09:11,887
I'LL BE SURE TO STOP BY LATER
FOR SOME PRACTICAL LESSONS

1173
01:09:11,888 --> 01:09:15,892
IN BEHAVIOR FROM THE REST
OF THE FAMILY.

1174
01:09:21,399 --> 01:09:24,401
GRR.

1175
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:37,415
INSUFFERABLE LITTLE MAN,
HE ALMOST BEGS ME TO FIRE HIM.

1176
01:09:37,416 --> 01:09:38,416
OH, HE DOESN'T CARE,
CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?

1177
01:09:38,417 --> 01:09:40,918
WHY NOT?

1178
01:09:40,919 --> 01:09:46,424
WHAT TRAGEDY IN HIS LIFE HAS DESTROYED
HIS MECHANISM FOR SELF-PRESERVATION?

1179
01:09:46,425 --> 01:09:49,927
HE SIMPLY DOESN'T CARE ABOUT
THE SAME THINGS MOST PEOPLE CARE ABOUT.

1180
01:09:49,928 --> 01:09:51,929
MAYBE HE CARES TOO MUCH.

1181
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:53,432
DID HE HURT YOU DOCTOR?

1182
01:09:53,433 --> 01:09:56,935
NO, NO.
HE'S NOT ANGRY AT ME.

1183
01:09:56,936 --> 01:09:59,938
I'M JUST A CONVENIENT TARGET.

1184
01:09:59,939 --> 01:10:03,942
WHO IS IT THEN?
HUMANITY IN GENERAL?

1185
01:10:03,943 --> 01:10:07,446
IT'S MORE SPECIFIC THAN THAT.

1186
01:10:07,447 --> 01:10:08,947
IT'S ME, ISN'T IT?

1187
01:10:08,948 --> 01:10:13,453
YOU? WHY WOULD HE
BE ANGRY WITH YOU?

1188
01:10:13,454 --> 01:10:15,955
IT IS ME, ISN'T IT DOCTOR?

1189
01:10:15,956 --> 01:10:20,460
OH, YOU COULD ONLY BE THE OBJECT OF
LOVE TO ANY MAN, MY DARLING, NOT ANGER.

1190
01:10:20,461 --> 01:10:22,962
NO, I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
HE'S INCAPABLE OF LOVE.

1191
01:10:22,963 --> 01:10:28,468
EVERY MAN HAS SILENT DREAMS THAT
HE DOESN'T SHARE WITH THE WORLD.

1192
01:10:28,469 --> 01:10:32,473
DELICATE LONGINGS
THAT HE FEARS WILL BE SHATTERED

1193
01:10:32,474 --> 01:10:36,977
BY RIDICULE AND SO WHY SHOULD
GARY BE IMMUNE TO SUCH FEELINGS?

1194
01:10:36,978 --> 01:10:41,982
BECAUSE HE SHOUTS?
MAKES SNIDE REMARKS?

1195
01:10:41,983 --> 01:10:47,988
THOSE ARE NOT HIS EMOTIONS,
THEY ARE HIS HIDING PLACE.

1196
01:10:47,989 --> 01:10:50,992
SO THE OBJECT OF LOVE
BECOMES THE OBJECTS OF SCORN?

1197
01:10:50,993 --> 01:10:56,498
THE OBJECT OF YOUR LOVE BECOMES
THE OBJECT OF HIS SCORN.

1198
01:10:56,499 --> 01:10:57,999
DAVID.

1199
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,001
UH-HMM.

1200
01:11:00,002 --> 01:11:02,504
HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS, DOCTOR?

1201
01:11:02,505 --> 01:11:06,007
I KNOW NOTHING MORE
THAN YOU DO, MY DEAR.

1202
01:11:06,008 --> 01:11:13,009
I SIMPLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRUTH
WHEN IT PRESENTS ITSELF TO ME.

1203
01:11:13,016 --> 01:11:16,519
FORGIVE ME, SWEETHEART, I HAVE
SOME PAPERS I HAVE TO ATTEND TO.

1204
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,521
OH, WON'T YOU STAY
FOR THE PARTY, DOCTOR.

1205
01:11:18,522 --> 01:11:21,023
NOTHING ELABORATE, JUST A TOAST
TO ANDREW AND NANCY.

1206
01:11:21,024 --> 01:11:25,027
PERHAPS, I NEVER OLD YOU THIS,
BUT I DESPISE THAT WOMAN.

1207
01:11:25,028 --> 01:11:30,033
OH, SO DO WE ALL, BUT,
BUT PLEASE, PLEASE COME FOR OUR SAKE.

1208
01:11:30,034 --> 01:11:35,038
WE NEED GOOD SPIRITS WHEN SHE'S
AROUND, LIKE AT AN EXORCISM.

1209
01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:38,041
I WILL DROP BY, MAKE A TOAST
TO EVOLUTION.

1210
01:11:38,042 --> 01:11:41,044
IN NANCY'S CASE,
IT'S A DAMN NECESSITY.

1211
01:11:44,549 --> 01:11:48,553
CIAO.

1212
01:11:54,059 --> 01:11:56,561
YOU KNOW, I THINK
I FORGOT SOME THINGS.

1213
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,563
DO YOU WANT TO RUN
TO THE MARKET WITH ME?

1214
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:03,568
SURE.

1215
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:07,573
THESE FALL DAYS
ARE SO PRECIOUS, AREN'T THEY?

1216
01:12:07,574 --> 01:12:13,579
WE NEVER KNOW HOW MANY
WE HAVE LEFT UNTIL WINTER.

1217
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:15,581
DAVID AND GARY
WERE GOOD FRIENDS.

1218
01:12:15,582 --> 01:12:20,085
DON'T BLAME YOURSELF.

1219
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:22,087
I'D HATE TO BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR HOSTILITY BETWEEN THEM.

1220
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:24,590
HOSTILITY?

1221
01:12:24,591 --> 01:12:28,094
WHAT COULD HAPPEN BETWEEN
TWO CIVILIZED EDUCATED MEN,

1222
01:12:28,095 --> 01:12:31,097
A CHESS MATCH TO THE DEATH?
PLEASE, DON'T BE MORBID.

1223
01:12:31,098 --> 01:12:34,100
OH.

1224
01:12:34,101 --> 01:12:37,103
BUT IT ISN'T AS IF DAVID AND I
WERE THE ROMANCE OF THE CENTURY.

1225
01:12:37,104 --> 01:12:39,105
WHAT'S THERE TO BE
SO JEALOUS OF?

1226
01:12:39,106 --> 01:12:41,107
YOU'RE ENGAGED TO THE MAN, DEAR.
AREN'T YOU?

1227
01:12:41,108 --> 01:12:42,108
YES.

1228
01:12:42,109 --> 01:12:44,110
SO, GARY IS OUT OF LUCK,
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT,

1229
01:12:44,111 --> 01:12:46,614
UNLESS YOU'RE NOT REALLY
COMMITTED TO THIS ENGAGEMENT.

1230
01:12:46,615 --> 01:12:48,616
OH, OF COURSE, I AM.
I AM.

1231
01:12:48,617 --> 01:12:50,618
BUT THE INTENSITY
OF MY FEELINGS--

1232
01:12:50,619 --> 01:12:53,120
NOBODY KNOWS THE INTENSITY  OF
YOUR FEELINGS AND NOBODY SHOULD.

1233
01:12:53,121 --> 01:12:56,123
IT'S NOT PUBLISHED
WITH THE MARRIAGE BANDS.

1234
01:12:56,124 --> 01:12:59,126
SO, DON'T EXPECT GARY
TO BE LESS JEALOUS,

1235
01:12:59,127 --> 01:13:01,128
BECAUSE YOU DON'T LOVE DAVID AS
MUCH AS YOU THINK YOU SHOULD.

1236
01:13:01,129 --> 01:13:04,131
AS MUCH AS HE LOVES ME?

1237
01:13:04,132 --> 01:13:08,637
SOMEHOW, OVER TIME
IT EQUALIZES ITSELF.

1238
01:13:08,638 --> 01:13:11,139
LOVE IS NEVER THE WAY
IT'S PRESENTED IN FICTION.

1239
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:14,643
WE ARRIVE AT IT
WITH SO LITTLE EXPERIENCE

1240
01:13:14,644 --> 01:13:20,649
AND SO MANY FALSE EXPECTATIONS,
DON'T AGONIZE OVER IT, TRUST YOUR DECISION.

1241
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:22,651
BUT IT ISN'T ME
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

1242
01:13:22,652 --> 01:13:25,655
I HAVE NO ILLUSIONS ANYMORE.

1243
01:13:25,656 --> 01:13:27,156
I'M NOT EXPECTING
A WHITE KNIGHT.

1244
01:13:27,157 --> 01:13:31,160
IT'S DAVID--HE DESERVES BETTER.

1245
01:13:31,161 --> 01:13:34,163
DAVID HAS DONE QUITE WELL FOR
HIMSELF, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1246
01:13:34,164 --> 01:13:35,665
HE'S WON A PRIZE WITH YOU.

1247
01:13:35,666 --> 01:13:38,167
HE'S GRABBED THE RING
ON THE CAROUSEL.

1248
01:13:38,168 --> 01:13:43,674
BRASS, NO TIMBRE, NO SPARKLE.

1249
01:13:43,675 --> 01:13:45,676
I'M SETTLING FOR SECURITY
WITH HIM AND HE KNOWS IT.

1250
01:13:45,677 --> 01:13:46,677
HOW DOES HE KNOW IT?

1251
01:13:46,678 --> 01:13:48,679
I TOLD HIM.

1252
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:53,183
DARLING, DISCRETION IS CALLED FOR,
EVEN IN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIPS.

1253
01:13:53,184 --> 01:13:55,185
DON'T MAKE HONESTY AN EXCUSE
FOR UNBURDENING YOURSELF

1254
01:13:55,186 --> 01:13:58,188
OF UNWANTED THOUGHTS
AND EMOTIONS.

1255
01:13:58,189 --> 01:14:01,691
THAT'S WHAT YOUR SISTER DOES,
AND HER MARRIAGE HAS BECOME A SIDESHOW.

1256
01:14:05,197 --> 01:14:06,698
THANK YOU.

1257
01:14:06,699 --> 01:14:11,703
MARCIA.

1258
01:14:19,211 --> 01:14:24,717
STOP.

1259
01:14:24,718 --> 01:14:31,223
I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH HELEN
TODAY--AN UNPLEASANT ONE.

1260
01:14:31,224 --> 01:14:33,726
ABOUT US?

1261
01:14:33,727 --> 01:14:37,229
YEAH.

1262
01:14:37,230 --> 01:14:43,236
WHAT ABOUT US?

1263
01:14:43,237 --> 01:14:46,740
I COULDN'T START OUR LIFE
TOGETHER WITH A LIE.

1264
01:14:46,741 --> 01:14:49,242
WHAT IS THE TRUTH, ANYWAY?

1265
01:14:49,243 --> 01:14:52,746
SOMETIMES IT'S JUST
A VERBALIZATION

1266
01:14:52,747 --> 01:14:57,751
OF OUR SURFACE INSECURITIES AND FEARS, BUT
ONCE SPOKEN THE WORDS DEFINE A REALITY.

1267
01:14:57,752 --> 01:15:03,257
THAT IS THE REALITY
I NEED TO INHABIT RIGHT NOW.

1268
01:15:03,258 --> 01:15:07,762
OLGA, I'M IN RECOVERY.

1269
01:15:07,763 --> 01:15:13,267
I'M FIGHTING TO STAY OUT OF THAT WORLD
OF DRUGS AND DELUSIONS THAT I INHABITED.

1270
01:15:13,268 --> 01:15:17,271
AND HONEST WORDS,
NO MATTER HOW IMPERFECT,

1271
01:15:17,272 --> 01:15:19,775
ARE MY ONLY TOOL
FOR GETTING BACK

1272
01:15:19,776 --> 01:15:24,780
AND FOR KEEPING
MY WORLD STRAIGHT.

1273
01:15:24,781 --> 01:15:29,284
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

1274
01:15:29,285 --> 01:15:32,787
YES.

1275
01:15:38,796 --> 01:15:40,797
WE WANT TO MOVE
TO CHARLESTON.

1276
01:15:40,798 --> 01:15:42,799
CHARLESTON?

1277
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,802
WHY NOT?
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT ALL THESE YEARS.

1278
01:15:45,803 --> 01:15:47,804
DAVID CAN GET A JOB IN THE PHILOSOPHY
DEPARTMENT AT THE COLLEGE.

1279
01:15:47,805 --> 01:15:50,306
WE CAN STAY IN THE HOUSE.

1280
01:15:50,307 --> 01:15:52,308
THAT IS, IF IT'S ALL RIGHT
WITH YOU AND MARCIA AND ANDREW.

1281
01:15:52,309 --> 01:15:53,810
YES, YES OF COURSE, WHY NOT?

1282
01:15:53,811 --> 01:15:55,812
THE CURRENT LEASE IS UP IN A
MONTH OR TWO; YOU COULD MOVE IN,

1283
01:15:55,813 --> 01:15:57,815
MAKE A REAL HOME OF IT AGAIN.

1284
01:15:57,816 --> 01:16:00,317
COMPLETE THE SISTERS
WHO VISIT AND STAY TOO LONG.

1285
01:16:00,318 --> 01:16:06,323
NO.
NEVER TOO LONG.

1286
01:16:06,324 --> 01:16:08,325
OH, MY GOD.
RIGHT IN THE COURTYARD.

1287
01:16:08,326 --> 01:16:09,827
HOW INDISCREET?

1288
01:16:09,828 --> 01:16:13,831
NO, SOMETHING'S WRONG.

1289
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:20,839
VINCENT'S LEAVING TODAY.

1290
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:22,841
FOR WHERE?

1291
01:16:22,842 --> 01:16:24,843
WHERE DOESN'T MATTER,
WHY IS THE QUESTION.

1292
01:16:24,844 --> 01:16:26,344
BALTIMORE.
MY WORK HERE IS FINISHED.

1293
01:16:26,345 --> 01:16:30,348
HIS WORK HAS VERY
LITTLE TO DO WITH IT.

1294
01:16:42,863 --> 01:16:44,864
WHAT, YOU'RE STILL HERE?

1295
01:16:44,865 --> 01:16:46,365
WHEN ARE YOU COMING BACK?

1296
01:16:46,366 --> 01:16:49,368
NEVER.
HE'S NEVER COMING BACK.

1297
01:16:49,369 --> 01:16:50,369
AT LEAST NOT TO ME, NOT TO US.

1298
01:16:50,370 --> 01:16:51,871
MARCIA.

1299
01:16:51,872 --> 01:16:53,372
I'M SORRY.
MAYBE I WAS WRONG.

1300
01:16:53,373 --> 01:16:55,876
WAS I--WAS I WRONG?
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG.

1301
01:16:55,877 --> 01:16:57,377
ALL RIGHT.
GO AHEAD.

1302
01:16:57,378 --> 01:16:58,879
THIS WASN'T MY IDEA.

1303
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,882
IF THIS HAS TO END WITH OPEN
WOUNDS FOR YOU, GO AHEAD.

1304
01:17:01,883 --> 01:17:04,885
ACTUALLY, IT WASN'T--
IT WASN'T VINCENT'S EITHER.

1305
01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:07,387
IT WAS HIS POOR CRAZY
WIFE'S IDEA.

1306
01:17:07,388 --> 01:17:11,892
YOU DON'T MIND
IF I CALL HER THAT DO YOU.

1307
01:17:11,893 --> 01:17:17,899
IT SEEMS THAT CRAZY HELEN
WAS PRAYING ONE DAY

1308
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:20,903
AND GOD TOLD HER TO TAKE
HER TWO LITTLE GIRLS

1309
01:17:20,904 --> 01:17:23,905
AWAY FROM THEIR SLUT
MONGERING FATHER.

1310
01:17:23,906 --> 01:17:29,911
SO, IT WAS REALLY GOD'S IDEA.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MAKES ME?

1311
01:17:29,912 --> 01:17:32,413
EVEN A CERTIFIABLE LOONY
LIKE HELEN WOULD WIN CUSTODY

1312
01:17:32,414 --> 01:17:34,917
OF THE GIRLS IN A DIVORCE
PROCEEDINGS WHAT WOULD VINCENT

1313
01:17:34,918 --> 01:17:37,920
HAVING BOFFED ME A FEW TIMES
A WEEK FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW.

1314
01:17:37,921 --> 01:17:40,923
BETTER A CRAZY MOTHER
THAN A CORRUPT FATHER, I GUESS.

1315
01:17:40,924 --> 01:17:43,926
MARCIA STOP THIS.

1316
01:17:43,927 --> 01:17:45,928
END IT WITH SOME DIGNITY.

1317
01:17:45,929 --> 01:17:50,432
I'M ALL OUT.
BUT I'M ALMOST THROUGH.

1318
01:17:50,433 --> 01:17:53,436
SO, DIVORCING CRAZY HELEN
WAS OUT BECAUSE VINCENT

1319
01:17:53,437 --> 01:17:56,940
LOVES HIS GIRLS
AND CRAZY HELEN KNOWS THAT.

1320
01:17:56,941 --> 01:17:59,442
AND MURDERING CRAZY HELEN
WAS OUT BECAUSE VINCENT'S

1321
01:17:59,443 --> 01:18:01,945
ONE OF THOSE SENSITIVE HUSBANDS,
SO THAT LEFT DESERTING ME.

1322
01:18:01,946 --> 01:18:03,947
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU, MARCIA.
YOU KNOW THIS IS TEARING ME UP.

1323
01:18:03,948 --> 01:18:09,953
OH, I KNOW. I KNOW.
BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH, RIGHT?

1324
01:18:09,954 --> 01:18:15,459
LIKE UM, LIKE WHEN I WAS A
LITTLE GIRL FATHER USED TO SAY,

1325
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:18,462
"YOU CAN HAVE EITHER
THE CHOCOLATE BUNNY

1326
01:18:18,463 --> 01:18:21,966
OR THE GLAZED EASTER EGG."

1327
01:18:21,967 --> 01:18:26,470
BUT I CRIED FOR BOTH
AND I GOT NOTHING.

1328
01:18:26,471 --> 01:18:31,476
SO, YOU SEE,
YOU'RE RIGHT, VINCENT.

1329
01:18:31,477 --> 01:18:35,480
YOU'RE DOING THE SENSIBLE THING.

1330
01:18:42,488 --> 01:18:48,493
I CAN'T GIVE UP MY GIRLS,
YOU KNOW.

1331
01:18:48,494 --> 01:18:49,996
IT'S NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO BE DEPRIVED OF THEIR COMPANY.

1332
01:18:49,997 --> 01:18:54,500
IT'S NOT THAT SELFISH.

1333
01:18:54,501 --> 01:18:58,004
I CAN'T HAVE THEM GROWING UP
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THEIR MOTHER.

1334
01:18:58,005 --> 01:19:03,509
THEY'RE SUCH GOOD,
BRIGHT GIRLS.

1335
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:07,013
IT WOULD JUST BE TOO
DESTRUCTIVE FOR THEM.

1336
01:19:07,014 --> 01:19:10,517
SO, I HAVE TO MAKE
THE SACRIFICE.

1337
01:19:10,518 --> 01:19:17,024
AND UNFORTUNATELY
SO DOES MARCIA.

1338
01:19:17,025 --> 01:19:22,029
IF THERE WERE ANY WAY THAT I COULD
BEAR THIS ALONE, BELIEVE ME I WOULD.

1339
01:19:33,542 --> 01:19:39,047
I'VE ENJOYED MAKING
YOUR ACQUAINTANCE AGAIN AS ADULTS AND, UM,

1340
01:19:39,048 --> 01:19:43,051
I HOPE THAT MY GIRLS
GROW UP TO BE AS CLOSE

1341
01:19:43,052 --> 01:19:47,056
AND MUTUALLY SUPPORTIVE
AS YOU THREE SISTERS.

1342
01:19:52,062 --> 01:19:59,062
AND I LOVE YOUR SISTER, DEEPLY.

1343
01:20:01,071 --> 01:20:05,674
OTHERWISE IT NEVER WOULD
HAVE COME TO THIS.

1344
01:20:05,675 --> 01:20:06,576
I HOPE YOU BELIEVE THAT.

1345
01:20:06,577 --> 01:20:08,578
OF COURSE WE DO, VINCENT.

1346
01:20:08,579 --> 01:20:13,583
YES, VINCENT, OF COURSE.

1347
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:24,094
GOODBYE, OLGA.

1348
01:20:24,095 --> 01:20:27,098
I KNOW YOU'LL MAKE
A FINE CHANCELLOR.

1349
01:20:27,099 --> 01:20:30,101
THANK YOU, VINCENT.
GOODBYE.

1350
01:20:30,102 --> 01:20:34,605
GOODBYE.

1351
01:20:34,606 --> 01:20:38,609
GOODBYE, IRENE.

1352
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:40,611
I HOPE YOU
AND DAVID WILL BE HAPPY.

1353
01:20:40,612 --> 01:20:44,115
THANK YOU.

1354
01:20:44,116 --> 01:20:51,117
I HOPE YOU WILL BE TOO.

1355
01:20:52,125 --> 01:20:59,125
MARCIA, WOULD YOU WALK ME OUT?
HELP ME FIND A CAB?

1356
01:21:04,638 --> 01:21:06,139
I SEE.
OKAY.

1357
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:09,642
WELL.

1358
01:21:34,169 --> 01:21:37,671
GOODBYE, MY GIRL.

1359
01:21:59,695 --> 01:22:05,200
MARCIA?
PLEASE.

1360
01:22:13,210 --> 01:22:16,712
VINCENT.

1361
01:22:44,243 --> 01:22:50,748
I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU.

1362
01:23:12,772 --> 01:23:19,773
I'M ALL RIGHT.
OKAY?

1363
01:23:21,282 --> 01:23:24,784
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1364
01:23:33,294 --> 01:23:37,798
COME ON, WE'LL PUT YOU
IN A CAB.

1365
01:24:18,842 --> 01:24:22,344
HE'S GONE.

1366
01:24:27,351 --> 01:24:33,856
FOUR MONTHS.

1367
01:24:33,857 --> 01:24:40,858
ALL LOVE SONGS MUST BE WRITTEN DURING THE
FIRST FOUR MONTHS OF A RELATIONSHIP.

1368
01:24:42,867 --> 01:24:45,869
IT HAD TO HAPPEN
EVENTUALLY, MARCIA.

1369
01:24:45,870 --> 01:24:49,873
YOU KNEW THAT.

1370
01:24:53,379 --> 01:24:57,382
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN
PREPARED FOR THIS.

1371
01:24:57,383 --> 01:25:00,385
YES.

1372
01:25:00,386 --> 01:25:01,886
THE SAME WAY I'M PREPARED
FOR THE EVENTUALITY OF DEATH,

1373
01:25:01,887 --> 01:25:05,390
THAT'S HOW PREPARED I AM.

1374
01:25:05,391 --> 01:25:09,894
"THOUGH LOVERS BE LOST,
LOVE SHALL NOT."

1375
01:25:09,895 --> 01:25:16,402
YOU'LL GET BETTER.
SLOWLY.

1376
01:25:16,403 --> 01:25:23,403
REALLY?
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?

1377
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:26,412
DON'T TURN ON ME
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE UPSET.

1378
01:25:26,413 --> 01:25:29,915
NO, REALLY.
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT IT.

1379
01:25:29,916 --> 01:25:33,920
CONSOLE ME WITH YOUR VAST
STOREHOUSE OF EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE.

1380
01:25:33,921 --> 01:25:35,422
IF YOU NEED TO SWIM IN YOUR OWN
BILE TO REVIVE YOUR SPIRITS,

1381
01:25:35,423 --> 01:25:37,924
GO AHEAD, BUT DO IT BY YOURSELF.

1382
01:25:37,925 --> 01:25:40,927
MARCIA, SHE'S TRYING
TO HELP YOU.

1383
01:25:40,928 --> 01:25:42,429
OH, YEAH, THE SAME WAY
SHE ALWAYS TRIES

1384
01:25:42,430 --> 01:25:44,931
TO HELP WITH
HER INTELLECTUAL PLATITUDES

1385
01:25:44,932 --> 01:25:47,434
AND LITERARY ALLUSIONS--
A LITTLE MILTON

1386
01:25:47,435 --> 01:25:49,936
OR EDNA SAINT VINCENT MILLAY
WHEN THE CHIPS ARE DOWN.

1387
01:25:49,937 --> 01:25:52,440
YOU THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO EVER LOVED SOMEONE

1388
01:25:52,441 --> 01:25:54,942
AND HAD TO SAY GOODBYE
AND GET ON WITH HER LIFE?

1389
01:25:54,943 --> 01:25:57,945
JUST BECAUSE I HAVEN'T
PARADED ALL MY LOVERS BY YOU,

1390
01:25:57,946 --> 01:26:00,948
AND ARGUED WITH THEM
AND CRIED OR--

1391
01:26:00,949 --> 01:26:03,951
DON'T PARADE ALL OF THEM.
PARADE JUST ONE.

1392
01:26:03,952 --> 01:26:06,454
ARGUE WITH AND CRY OVER
JUST ONE FOR ME?

1393
01:26:06,455 --> 01:26:08,956
NO, HISTRIONICS
ARE YOUR DEPARTMENT.

1394
01:26:08,957 --> 01:26:10,959
STOP IT. BOTH OF YOU.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1395
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:13,462
THERE IS A SPACE BETWEEN
HISTRIONICS AND COLD TIT.

1396
01:26:13,463 --> 01:26:15,964
TRY INHABITING IT SOMETIME.

1397
01:26:15,965 --> 01:26:22,471
I HAVE.
YOU JUST WEREN'T PRESENT WHEN IT HAPPENED.

1398
01:26:22,472 --> 01:26:27,476
WHEN I FALL IN LOVE,
NO ONE SMILES AND CONGRATULATES.

1399
01:26:27,477 --> 01:26:29,979
THEY SMIRK AND DISPARAGE
AND WHEN THE AFFAIR'S OVER,

1400
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:32,482
NO ONE CONSOLES.

1401
01:26:32,483 --> 01:26:35,985
THEY SIGH WITH RELIEF
AND CALL IT INEVITABLE.

1402
01:26:35,986 --> 01:26:38,488
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT, OLGA.

1403
01:26:38,489 --> 01:26:40,990
NEITHER WOULD I.

1404
01:26:40,991 --> 01:26:44,494
I WONDER.

1405
01:26:44,495 --> 01:26:51,496
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW, YOU NEVER
TRUSTED US ENOUGH TO TEST US?

1406
01:26:53,004 --> 01:26:59,510
I'M SORRY ABOUT VINCENT,
MARCIA.

1407
01:26:59,511 --> 01:27:05,015
I KNOW HOW MUCH--

1408
01:27:05,016 --> 01:27:11,022
I'M JUST REALLY SORRY.

1409
01:27:11,023 --> 01:27:13,525
THANK YOU.

1410
01:27:13,526 --> 01:27:17,028
DON'T BE NERVOUS.

1411
01:27:17,029 --> 01:27:22,033
YOU JUST TELL THEM
IT'S GOOD NEWS.

1412
01:27:28,041 --> 01:27:32,545
GOOD NEWS.
GOOD NEWS.

1413
01:27:32,546 --> 01:27:37,049
OKAY.

1414
01:27:44,558 --> 01:27:51,064
WELL, I HAVE GOOD NEWS.

1415
01:27:51,065 --> 01:27:54,067
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

1416
01:28:04,078 --> 01:28:07,582
YOU LOOK TERRIBLE.
WHAT IS IT?

1417
01:28:07,583 --> 01:28:12,587
THE AGING PROCESS.

1418
01:28:12,588 --> 01:28:14,589
SO WHERE'S THE BARRACUDA?

1419
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:17,091
ARE YOU REFERRING TO MY WIFE?
YOUR SISTER-IN-LAW?

1420
01:28:17,092 --> 01:28:19,093
THE MOTHER OF YOU NEPHEW?

1421
01:28:19,094 --> 01:28:21,095
I'M NOT RELATED TO FETUSES
REGARDLESS OF GENDER,

1422
01:28:21,096 --> 01:28:23,097
BUT YES I WAS REFERRING
TO THAT WOMAN.

1423
01:28:23,098 --> 01:28:25,100
FUCK YOU.

1424
01:28:25,101 --> 01:28:26,602
ANDREW, PLEASE.

1425
01:28:26,603 --> 01:28:28,604
SHE'S TOO MUCH.

1426
01:28:28,605 --> 01:28:31,607
SHE TREATS MY MARRIAGE WITH THE SAME
IRREVERENCE SHE TREATS HER OWN.

1427
01:28:31,608 --> 01:28:34,109
ANDREW, LEAVE HER ALONE.
SHE'S UPSET RIGHT NOW.

1428
01:28:34,110 --> 01:28:36,612
RIGHT NOW?
SHE'S ALWAYS UPSET.

1429
01:28:36,613 --> 01:28:39,114
IT'S A CONSTANT STATE.

1430
01:28:39,115 --> 01:28:41,617
AND HER FAVORITE, SHE WOULDN'T
HAVE ANOTHER IF YOU PAID HER.

1431
01:28:41,618 --> 01:28:43,118
IT'S STRANGE, WE SEEM TO BE
GROWING MORE ALIKE--

1432
01:28:43,119 --> 01:28:45,121
THAT'S A DISTURBING THOUGHT.

1433
01:28:45,122 --> 01:28:51,127
AS WE GROW FURTHER APART.

1434
01:28:55,132 --> 01:29:00,136
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

1435
01:29:03,642 --> 01:29:06,644
WILL SOMEBODY TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED?

1436
01:29:06,645 --> 01:29:07,144
VINCENT HAD TO--

1437
01:29:07,145 --> 01:29:09,647
STOP. DON'T.

1438
01:29:09,648 --> 01:29:11,649
VINCENT WHAT?

1439
01:29:11,650 --> 01:29:14,652
VINCENT'S WIFE MADE ANOTHER
FEEBLE ATTEMPT AT SUICIDE

1440
01:29:14,653 --> 01:29:17,655
THIS TIME BY HOLDING
A PAPER BAG OVER HER HEAD?

1441
01:29:17,656 --> 01:29:20,658
VINCENT'S DAUGHTERS PLACED FIRST AND
SECOND IN THE GLORIOUS YOUTH COMPETITION.

1442
01:29:20,659 --> 01:29:23,662
VINCENT SMILED.
VINCENT BURPED.

1443
01:29:23,663 --> 01:29:25,664
I'M SORRY TO HAVE OVERBURDENED
YOU WITH THE INCONSEQUENTIALS

1444
01:29:25,665 --> 01:29:28,166
OF MY AFFAIR WITH VINCENT.

1445
01:29:28,167 --> 01:29:30,168
I DID IT TO AVOID
THE DEEPER ISSUES

1446
01:29:30,169 --> 01:29:32,170
I WASN'T COMFORTABLE
DISCUSSING WITH YOU.

1447
01:29:32,171 --> 01:29:33,672
YOU'VE BECOME A STRANGER TO ME,
ANDREW.

1448
01:29:33,673 --> 01:29:37,175
A GENETIC ACQUAINTANCE.

1449
01:29:37,176 --> 01:29:41,180
MARCIA, STOP.
SHE DOESN'T MEAN THAT.

1450
01:29:41,181 --> 01:29:46,185
YES, SHE DOES.
THAT IS TRUE FOR ALL OF YOU.

1451
01:29:46,186 --> 01:29:50,690
YOU'VE ALL MADE ME A STRANGER,
SIMPLY BECAUSE I MADE

1452
01:29:50,691 --> 01:29:52,692
ONE DECISION
WITHOUT YOUR APPROVAL.

1453
01:29:52,693 --> 01:29:54,694
DON'T CONGRATULATE YOURSELF
TOO HEARTILY,

1454
01:29:54,695 --> 01:29:56,195
YOU STUPID LITTLE BOY FOR
MARRYING THAT LOW-LIFE BITCH.

1455
01:29:56,196 --> 01:29:58,197
SHUT UP.

1456
01:29:58,198 --> 01:30:01,201
GOOD ANSWER.

1457
01:30:01,202 --> 01:30:03,704
YOU THINK WE FULFILL OURSELVES
BY FOLLOWING YOU THROUGH LIFE,

1458
01:30:03,705 --> 01:30:08,208
WIPING YOUR ASS AT EVERY TURN?
DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF.

1459
01:30:08,209 --> 01:30:11,211
IF YOU COULD MAKE
ONE INTELLIGENT DECISION

1460
01:30:11,212 --> 01:30:13,714
BY YOURSELF, WE COULD DEVOTE
OURSELVES TO WORTHIER PURSUITS.

1461
01:30:13,715 --> 01:30:15,716
LIKE EXTRA-MARITAL AFFAIRS?

1462
01:30:15,717 --> 01:30:18,218
THAT'S A DANGEROUS
TOPIC FOR YOU.

1463
01:30:18,219 --> 01:30:20,722
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

1464
01:30:20,723 --> 01:30:24,225
WHY DOES IT HAVE TO COME TO THIS
EVERY TIME WE'RE TOGETHER?

1465
01:30:24,226 --> 01:30:27,729
BECAUSE WE'VE LEARNED EACH
OTHER'S COMBAT SKILLS

1466
01:30:27,730 --> 01:30:29,731
IN ORDER TO DEFEND OURSELVES
FROM EACH OTHER.

1467
01:30:29,732 --> 01:30:33,234
WHY WE CAN'T WE LEARN SOMETHING
POSITIVE FROM EACH OTHER,

1468
01:30:33,235 --> 01:30:37,238
OR IS THAT TOO RADICAL
AN IDEA FOR THIS FAMILY?

1469
01:30:37,239 --> 01:30:40,742
YOU'RE RIGHT, DARLING.
WE SHOULD ALL LEARN FROM YOU.

1470
01:30:48,752 --> 01:30:50,753
I CAME HERE WITH GOOD NEWS.

1471
01:30:50,754 --> 01:30:56,258
WHAT, ANDREW?
TELL US YOUR NEWS.

1472
01:31:03,768 --> 01:31:10,768
WELL, IT'S REALLY
KIND OF A SURPRISE.

1473
01:31:18,784 --> 01:31:23,788
WHAT IS THIS?

1474
01:31:29,294 --> 01:31:32,797
$175,000?

1475
01:31:32,798 --> 01:31:34,298
FOR EACH OF US.

1476
01:31:34,299 --> 01:31:36,802
WHERE DID THIS COME FROM?

1477
01:31:36,803 --> 01:31:38,303
FROM THE HOUSE IN CHARLESTON.

1478
01:31:38,304 --> 01:31:41,306
WHAT?

1479
01:31:41,307 --> 01:31:44,810
I SOLD THE HOUSE IN CHARLESTON.

1480
01:31:44,811 --> 01:31:47,312
YOU SOLD THE HOUSE?

1481
01:31:47,313 --> 01:31:51,316
YES.

1482
01:31:51,317 --> 01:31:53,318
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT WITHOUT
EVEN CONSULTING YOUR SISTERS?

1483
01:31:53,319 --> 01:31:54,821
I'M THE EXECUTOR OF THE ESTATE.

1484
01:31:54,822 --> 01:31:56,322
OH, ANDREW.

1485
01:31:56,323 --> 01:31:57,824
I'M THE EXECUTOR OF THE ESTATE.

1486
01:31:57,825 --> 01:32:00,827
I DON'T HAVE TO CONSULT YOU
FOR EVERY DECISION I MAKE.

1487
01:32:00,828 --> 01:32:04,330
NO, BUT I'M SURE
YOU CONSULTED YOUR WIFE.

1488
01:32:04,331 --> 01:32:05,832
NO ONE WANTS
TO BE BOTHERED WITH THE DETAILS

1489
01:32:05,833 --> 01:32:08,334
OF MAINTAINING THE HOUSE,
OF INTERVIEWING

1490
01:32:08,335 --> 01:32:10,837
PROSPECTIVE TENANTS,
OF COLLECTING THE RENT.

1491
01:32:10,838 --> 01:32:12,839
THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES, YOU
TACITLY ENTRUST TO ME

1492
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:14,341
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO A DECISION
OF ANY MAGNITUDE--

1493
01:32:14,342 --> 01:32:16,844
ANDREW, LISTEN TO YOURSELF.

1494
01:32:16,845 --> 01:32:18,846
I SUPPOSE YOU FELT YOU MADE SUCH
A SUCCESS OF THAT OTHER GREAT

1495
01:32:18,847 --> 01:32:21,348
DECISION IN YOUR LIFE,
YOUR MARRIAGE, THAT YOU WERE SUDDENLY

1496
01:32:21,349 --> 01:32:23,851
QUALIFIED TO SELL OUR HOUSE
WITHOUT OUR PERMISSION?

1497
01:32:23,852 --> 01:32:27,855
I'M A GROWN MAN NOW.

1498
01:32:27,856 --> 01:32:28,856
I DON'T NEED TO.

1499
01:32:28,857 --> 01:32:31,859
YES, YOU DO.

1500
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:35,363
YOU DON'T ASSUME YOUR MATURITY
WITH THOUGHTLESS INCONSIDERATE ACTS.

1501
01:32:35,364 --> 01:32:37,866
THAT'S NOT MANHOOD;
IT'S BRUTISHNESS.

1502
01:32:37,867 --> 01:32:40,368
IF I HAD PRESENTED IT TO YOU,
WE WOULD HAVE DISCUSSED IT

1503
01:32:40,369 --> 01:32:43,371
ENDLESSLY, FOUGHT OVER IT,
AND NEVER REACHED A DECISION.

1504
01:32:43,372 --> 01:32:45,874
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUR CHOICE,
NOT YOUR CHOICE.

1505
01:32:45,875 --> 01:32:48,877
NO, NO I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THAT.

1506
01:32:48,878 --> 01:32:50,879
I'M STARTING MY FAMILY NOW.

1507
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,381
I'M NOT GOING TO BE TIED
TO THAT HOUSE

1508
01:32:52,382 --> 01:32:54,383
AND YOUR APRON'S STRINGS
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

1509
01:32:54,384 --> 01:32:57,386
DON'T YOU DARE THROW
YOUR NANCYISMS IN OUR FACES.

1510
01:32:57,387 --> 01:32:59,889
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE TIED TO US,
WE'RE YOUR SISTERS.

1511
01:32:59,890 --> 01:33:05,394
IT'S JUST AN EXCUSE, ANYWAY.

1512
01:33:05,395 --> 01:33:08,397
YOU DID IT FOR THE MONEY.

1513
01:33:08,398 --> 01:33:10,399
I HAVE MY CHILD TO THINK OF.
THAT'S THE FUTURE.

1514
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:11,902
THE HOUSE IS A THING
OF THE PAST.

1515
01:33:11,903 --> 01:33:13,403
IRENE AND DAVID WERE PLANNING
ON MOVING INTO THE HOUSE

1516
01:33:13,404 --> 01:33:18,408
AFTER THEY GOT MARRIED.
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

1517
01:33:20,912 --> 01:33:23,914
NOW YOU WEREN'T SERIOUSLY
CONSIDERING THAT WAY, WERE YOU?

1518
01:33:23,915 --> 01:33:28,418
WHEN I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL
WE SPOKE ABOUT DRIVING DOWN, REMEMBER?

1519
01:33:28,419 --> 01:33:30,420
YEAH, BUT I THOUGHT
THAT THAT WAS JUST--

1520
01:33:30,421 --> 01:33:32,924
JUST DELUSIONS OF A SICK GIRL?

1521
01:33:32,925 --> 01:33:35,426
NO, I MEANT IT AND IF YOU WERE
JUST WEAVING A SICK BED FANTASY

1522
01:33:35,427 --> 01:33:40,932
FOR ME, I BELIEVED IT SO
COMPLETELY, IT MADE ME STRONGER

1523
01:33:40,933 --> 01:33:46,437
AND GAVE ME HOPE FOR THE FUTURE
AND I THOUGHT I HAD ONE, TOO,

1524
01:33:46,438 --> 01:33:50,943
YOU KNOW, EVEN IF IT WAS TIED
TO MY PAST.

1525
01:33:50,944 --> 01:33:56,448
I'M SORRY.

1526
01:33:56,449 --> 01:33:57,449
I HAD NO IDEA.

1527
01:33:57,450 --> 01:34:01,453
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

1528
01:34:01,454 --> 01:34:02,955
YOU'VE ALL PATTED ME ON THE HEAD
SO MANY TIMES;

1529
01:34:02,956 --> 01:34:04,456
YOU CONSIDER IT SUSTENANCE.

1530
01:34:04,457 --> 01:34:06,458
WE CAN STILL GO DOWN.

1531
01:34:06,459 --> 01:34:09,462
WHAT'S THERE FOR US NOW,
ANDREW?

1532
01:34:09,463 --> 01:34:16,463
WHEN YOU SOLD THE HOUSE,
SO MUCH WENT WITH IT.

1533
01:34:16,470 --> 01:34:20,973
FATHER SAID WE SHOULD BE
LIKE ONE HEART BEATING IN FOUR BODIES.

1534
01:34:25,980 --> 01:34:30,484
DID HE?

1535
01:34:33,989 --> 01:34:36,991
NO, OF COURSE HE DIDN'T.

1536
01:34:41,496 --> 01:34:45,499
REAL ESTATE MARKET HASN'T BEEN
THIS GOOD IN YEARS.

1537
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:48,003
I COULDN'T PASS UP
THE OPPORTUNITY.

1538
01:34:48,004 --> 01:34:49,504
SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND'S
A GREAT PRICE.

1539
01:34:49,505 --> 01:34:54,509
YES, A VERY GREAT PRICE.

1540
01:34:58,514 --> 01:35:03,518
TAKE IT.

1541
01:35:03,519 --> 01:35:05,520
I THOUGHT IT WOULD
MAKE YOU HAPPY.

1542
01:35:05,521 --> 01:35:08,024
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE
A WONDERFUL SURPRISE.

1543
01:35:08,025 --> 01:35:11,527
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

1544
01:35:27,045 --> 01:35:28,545
DID YOU TELL THEM?

1545
01:35:28,546 --> 01:35:31,548
HE TOLD US.

1546
01:35:31,549 --> 01:35:34,551
ISN'T THAT GREAT NEWS?

1547
01:35:34,552 --> 01:35:37,554
OH SPARE US,
HE TRIED THAT ONE ALREADY.

1548
01:35:37,555 --> 01:35:40,557
$700,000 IS A GREAT PRICE.

1549
01:35:40,558 --> 01:35:42,059
THE MARKET HAS NOT BEEN
THIS GOOD IN YEARS.

1550
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:44,561
ANDREW KNEW HE COULDN'T PASS UP
THE OPPORTUNITY--

1551
01:35:44,562 --> 01:35:46,564
THE OPPORTUNITY, YES.
WE HEARD THE SPIEL.

1552
01:35:48,067 --> 01:35:50,568
LET'S JUST HAVE OUR LITTLE PARTY
AND GET IT OVER WITH, SHALL WE?

1553
01:35:50,569 --> 01:35:52,070
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GIVE ME
A PARTY.

1554
01:35:52,071 --> 01:35:53,571
NOBODY'S FORCING YOU.

1555
01:35:53,572 --> 01:35:54,572
ANDREW, WHY DON'T
WE JUST GO HOME, HUH?

1556
01:35:54,573 --> 01:35:56,574
IF YOU WANT TO.

1557
01:35:56,575 --> 01:36:00,578
NONSENSE. DAVID'S COMING
AND DOCTOR CHEBRIN AND HARRY.

1558
01:36:00,579 --> 01:36:02,580
AND VINCENT.

1559
01:36:02,581 --> 01:36:04,583
NO. NO.
HE'S NOT GOING TO BE HERE.

1560
01:36:04,584 --> 01:36:07,086
THANK YOU FOR ASKING.

1561
01:36:07,087 --> 01:36:10,589
NEITHER WILL I.

1562
01:36:10,590 --> 01:36:15,594
BUT YOU MUST EVEN THOUGH
THE PARTY'S NOT FOR YOU, ANYWAY.

1563
01:36:15,595 --> 01:36:18,097
IT'S FOR OUR LITTLE
UNBORN NEPHEW.

1564
01:36:18,098 --> 01:36:21,100
GOD SAVE HIM FROM YOUR GENES.

1565
01:36:21,101 --> 01:36:23,103
DON'T TALK ABOUT
MY CHILD LIKE THAT.

1566
01:36:23,104 --> 01:36:27,607
HE'S NOT A CHILD YET,
DEAR, JUST SOME PROTOPLASM

1567
01:36:27,608 --> 01:36:30,110
DOING THE BACKSTROKE
IN YOUR UTERUS.

1568
01:36:30,111 --> 01:36:32,112
BESIDES, I'M SURE
HE COULDN'T EVEN HEAR ME.

1569
01:36:32,113 --> 01:36:33,613
YOU REALLY HATE ME, DON'T YOU?

1570
01:36:33,614 --> 01:36:39,619
NO. NOT AT ALL.

1571
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:42,623
DO YOU HATE A DOG
FOR PEEING ON THE CARPET?

1572
01:36:42,624 --> 01:36:44,125
OF COURSE NOT.
SHE CAN'T HELP IT.

1573
01:36:44,126 --> 01:36:46,627
IT'S HER NATURE.

1574
01:36:46,628 --> 01:36:49,130
YOU JUST HAVE TO LEAVE HER
OUTSIDE.

1575
01:36:49,131 --> 01:36:52,633
YOU REALLY HATE ME.

1576
01:36:52,634 --> 01:36:54,135
IS THAT YOUR GOAL?

1577
01:36:54,136 --> 01:36:56,137
BECAUSE I JUST MIGHT BE ABLE
TO ACCOMMODATE YOU.

1578
01:36:56,138 --> 01:36:59,640
MARCIA, STOP IT.
YOU'RE ENJOYING THIS TOO MUCH.

1579
01:36:59,641 --> 01:37:03,145
ANDREW, ARE YOU GOING TO LET HER
SPEAK TO ME LIKE THAT?

1580
01:37:03,146 --> 01:37:08,150
YOU WANT ME TO BELT HER?
I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD HELP.

1581
01:37:08,151 --> 01:37:12,654
I WOULD LIKE TO GO.

1582
01:37:12,655 --> 01:37:16,158
WE WON'T BE SPENDING MUCH TIME
TOGETHER AFTER MY CHILD IS BORN.

1583
01:37:16,159 --> 01:37:17,659
DON'T KEEP BRINGING
UP THAT CHILD

1584
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:21,664
OR SOMEONE JUST MIGHT ASK YOU
WHO THE FATHER IS.

1585
01:37:21,665 --> 01:37:24,667
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

1586
01:37:24,668 --> 01:37:27,670
I SAID, I HEARD
YOU'VE BEEN MAKING YOUR WAY

1587
01:37:27,671 --> 01:37:31,174
THROUGH THE SCHOOL ORCHESTRA.

1588
01:37:31,175 --> 01:37:33,176
WHERE WERE YOU FIVE MONTHS AGO,
THE STRING SECTION?

1589
01:37:33,177 --> 01:37:36,179
YOU BITCH.
YOU FUCKED UP--

1590
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:38,181
LET HER, ANDREW.
LET HER SHOW HER ROOTS.

1591
01:37:38,182 --> 01:37:39,182
YEAH.
I'M TEMPTED.

1592
01:37:39,183 --> 01:37:41,185
GET OFF ME.

1593
01:37:41,186 --> 01:37:42,186
HAPPY?

1594
01:37:42,187 --> 01:37:44,188
ARE YOU?

1595
01:37:44,189 --> 01:37:46,690
YOU HYPOCRITICAL BITCH.

1596
01:37:46,691 --> 01:37:48,692
IF YOU WERE CAPABLE
OF CONCEIVING,

1597
01:37:48,693 --> 01:37:52,196
YOU'D BE PREGNANT WITH THAT
DAGO'S ILLEGITIMATE BASTARD.

1598
01:37:52,197 --> 01:37:55,199
XENOPHOBIA AND REDUNDANCIES,
ALL IN THE SAME SENTENCE.

1599
01:37:55,200 --> 01:38:00,205
GO TO THE BACK OF THE CLASS.

1600
01:38:09,715 --> 01:38:11,216
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1601
01:38:11,217 --> 01:38:13,218
THE USUAL.

1602
01:38:13,219 --> 01:38:16,721
TELL HIM WHY, ANDREW.

1603
01:38:16,722 --> 01:38:21,227
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
A FESTIVE OCCASION.

1604
01:38:21,228 --> 01:38:24,230
IT IS AND WE'RE ALL DOING
WHAT WE ENJOY MOST.

1605
01:38:24,231 --> 01:38:25,731
OH, I CAN IMAGINE WHAT
THAT WAS FOR YOU.

1606
01:38:25,732 --> 01:38:27,233
YOU SURPASSED YOURSELF TODAY.

1607
01:38:27,234 --> 01:38:27,733
SO DID YOU.

1608
01:38:27,734 --> 01:38:30,236
THAT BITCH IS EVIL.

1609
01:38:30,237 --> 01:38:32,738
OLGA, WHY CAN'T YOU
CONTROL THESE SITUATIONS?

1610
01:38:32,739 --> 01:38:34,240
YOU'D HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

1611
01:38:34,241 --> 01:38:37,244
REGARDLESS, OLGA.

1612
01:38:37,245 --> 01:38:38,745
APPARENTLY, HARRY
MADE YOU CLASS MONITOR

1613
01:38:38,746 --> 01:38:42,249
AND YOU FELL SHORT
OF HIS EXPECTATIONS.

1614
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:44,751
I'M LEAVING.

1615
01:38:44,752 --> 01:38:47,254
I'VE TRIED TO BE PART
OF THIS FAMILY.

1616
01:38:47,255 --> 01:38:49,256
I HAVE TRIED TO UNDERSTAND
YOU AND BE PATIENT--

1617
01:38:49,257 --> 01:38:56,257
IRENE, STOP PLAYING
THE GOD-DAMMED THING.

1618
01:38:58,767 --> 01:39:03,271
I HAVE TRIED TO BE PATIENT
WITH YOUR "ECCENTRICITIES,"

1619
01:39:03,272 --> 01:39:06,274
AS ANDREW CALLS THEM.

1620
01:39:06,275 --> 01:39:12,780
BUT I THINK YOU PEOPLE
ARE ALL JUST LOW, MEAN

1621
01:39:12,781 --> 01:39:16,285
AND NOT NEARLY SO SMART
OR HIGH-CLASS

1622
01:39:16,286 --> 01:39:23,286
AS YOU THINK YOU ARE
OR AS I THOUGHT YOU WERE.

1623
01:39:25,795 --> 01:39:31,300
YOU KNOW, WITH SOME ASSISTANCE
FROM THE BOOK

1624
01:39:31,301 --> 01:39:33,802
OF SYNONYMS AND ANTONYMS,
THAT WOULDN'T BE A BAD SPEECH.

1625
01:39:33,803 --> 01:39:38,308
SHUT UP.
THAT'S JUST WHAT I MEAN.

1626
01:39:38,309 --> 01:39:40,310
I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU
ILLUSTRATE YOUR POINT.

1627
01:39:40,311 --> 01:39:45,315
I DON'T WANT TO BE A PART
OF YOUR FAMILY ANYMORE.

1628
01:39:45,316 --> 01:39:48,818
I'M STARTING MY OWN FAMILY.

1629
01:39:48,819 --> 01:39:52,321
AND ANDREW, YOU NEED TO DECIDE
WHICH ONE YOU WANT TO BE PART OF.

1630
01:40:10,342 --> 01:40:12,843
DRAMATIC PAUSE.

1631
01:40:29,362 --> 01:40:36,363
GO AHEAD, ANDREW.

1632
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:43,870
YOU MADE YOUR DECISION
WHEN YOU GAVE US THESE.

1633
01:41:06,401 --> 01:41:08,402
WHAT IS THAT?

1634
01:41:08,403 --> 01:41:10,905
UH, MAD MONEY.

1635
01:41:10,906 --> 01:41:14,909
HOW APPROPRIATE FOR YOU.

1636
01:41:14,910 --> 01:41:16,411
IT TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH TO DRAG
YOUR SORRY ASS OUT OF THERE.

1637
01:41:16,412 --> 01:41:17,912
JESUS--

1638
01:41:17,913 --> 01:41:22,917
DO NOT JESUS ME, ANDREW.
YOU GET ME A FUCKING CAB.

1639
01:41:22,918 --> 01:41:26,420
JESUS ME.

1640
01:41:32,429 --> 01:41:33,929
OH, LEAVE HER ALONE, HARRY,
THIS ISN'T THE TIME.

1641
01:41:33,930 --> 01:41:35,931
WHY NOT?
ANDREW WILL BE BACK.

1642
01:41:35,932 --> 01:41:38,434
HE ALWAYS FORGIVES HER.

1643
01:41:38,435 --> 01:41:40,936
ASSUMING I'M THE ONE REQUIRING
FORGIVENESS.

1644
01:41:40,937 --> 01:41:43,939
WHAT HAPPENED?

1645
01:41:43,940 --> 01:41:45,941
VINCENT LEFT.

1646
01:41:45,942 --> 01:41:48,444
ANDREW SOLD THE HOUSE
IN CHARLESTON.

1647
01:41:48,445 --> 01:41:50,947
OH MY GOD.

1648
01:41:50,948 --> 01:41:53,450
PEOPLE IN 12-STEP PROGRAMS
ARE SO ANNOYINGLY HONEST.

1649
01:41:53,451 --> 01:41:56,953
IT'S QUITE BARBARIC, REALLY.

1650
01:41:56,954 --> 01:42:02,459
I SEE.

1651
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:04,961
WHAT DO YOU SEE,
YOU FOOLISH LITTLE MAN?

1652
01:42:04,962 --> 01:42:06,963
I'M SUPPOSED TO OPEN MY ARMS
TO YOU NOW.

1653
01:42:06,964 --> 01:42:07,965
PLEASE DON'T BOTHER.

1654
01:42:07,966 --> 01:42:11,469
AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED.

1655
01:42:11,470 --> 01:42:12,470
I'M SUPPOSED
TO WELCOME YOU BACK.

1656
01:42:12,471 --> 01:42:13,971
SO IF YOU SUPPOSED--

1657
01:42:13,972 --> 01:42:16,974
I'M SUPPOSED TO WELCOME YOU BACK
AND FORGIVE YOU.

1658
01:42:16,975 --> 01:42:21,979
HARRY, HARRY.

1659
01:42:21,980 --> 01:42:24,982
IF YOU WANT
TO WITHHOLD APPROVAL,

1660
01:42:24,983 --> 01:42:31,984
INTIMIDATE AND GIVE REWARDS
AND PUNISHMENTS, BUY A DOG.

1661
01:42:33,993 --> 01:42:36,995
OH, THE "LITTLE MOTHER"
HASN'T ARRIVED YET?

1662
01:42:36,996 --> 01:42:38,997
"THE LITTLE MOTHER," AS YOU
SO APPROPRIATELY CALL HER,

1663
01:42:38,998 --> 01:42:40,499
HAS COME AND GONE.

1664
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:42,501
I MISSED THE TOAST.

1665
01:42:42,502 --> 01:42:46,506
WE ALL DID, DOCTOR.

1666
01:42:55,015 --> 01:42:57,517
WE DON'T NEED THE HOUSE.

1667
01:42:57,518 --> 01:42:59,018
WE COULD STAY AT MY APARTMENT
AND LATER--

1668
01:42:59,019 --> 01:43:01,020
LATER.
IT'S ALWAYS LATER.

1669
01:43:01,021 --> 01:43:03,523
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT, IRENE,
YOU'LL SEE.

1670
01:43:03,524 --> 01:43:06,527
I KNOW. SOMETIMES YOU HAVE
TO POSTPONE GRATIFICATION.

1671
01:43:06,528 --> 01:43:09,530
MAKE CONCESSIONS.

1672
01:43:09,531 --> 01:43:12,533
BUT IF WE GET TOO FAR FROM WHAT
WE PLANNED FOR OURSELVES,

1673
01:43:12,534 --> 01:43:19,039
IF CONCESSIONS AND COMPROMISE
BECOME OUR LIFE,

1674
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:22,543
WE DISAPPEAR
WITH OUR ASPIRATIONS.

1675
01:43:22,544 --> 01:43:26,047
SWEETIE, YOU'RE TOO YOUNG
TO BE HAVING SUCH THOUGHTS.

1676
01:43:26,048 --> 01:43:27,549
AM I, DOCTOR?

1677
01:43:27,550 --> 01:43:31,052
YES.
IT'S ALL TRUE, OF COURSE.

1678
01:43:31,053 --> 01:43:34,556
BUT DARLING, YOU SHOULDN'T
REALIZE IT 'TIL MUCH LATER.

1679
01:43:34,557 --> 01:43:36,558
YOUR CYNICISM IS DISCOURAGING,
DOCTOR.

1680
01:43:36,559 --> 01:43:40,061
I'M NOT DISCOURAGING HER.

1681
01:43:40,062 --> 01:43:44,066
I'M ENCOURAGING HER
TO KEEP HER DELUSIONS.

1682
01:43:44,067 --> 01:43:46,068
YOU NEED THEM WHEN
YOU'RE YOUNG.

1683
01:43:46,069 --> 01:43:50,072
I'VE HAD THEM FOR SO LONG,
I'VE OUTGROWN THEM, PREMATURELY.

1684
01:43:50,073 --> 01:43:54,076
AND I'VE SWORN OFF
ALL SUBSTITUTES THAT I FOUND.

1685
01:43:54,077 --> 01:43:57,079
SO, WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE ME?

1686
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:59,081
FILL THE VOID WITH LOVE.

1687
01:43:59,082 --> 01:44:01,584
FILL THE VOID WITH LOVE.

1688
01:44:01,585 --> 01:44:03,587
A CONVENIENT PHILOSOPHY
FOR YOU TO ESPOUSE.

1689
01:44:03,588 --> 01:44:05,589
I WASN'T ADDRESSING YOU.

1690
01:44:05,590 --> 01:44:08,592
WHERE IS OUR TOAST?
WE WERE GOING TO TOAST NEW LIFE.

1691
01:44:08,593 --> 01:44:11,094
NOW, WE'LL TOAST LOVE AND HOPE.

1692
01:44:11,095 --> 01:44:14,598
THEY'RE BASICALLY
THE SAME THING.

1693
01:44:14,599 --> 01:44:17,601
I'LL GET THE GLASSES.

1694
01:44:17,602 --> 01:44:21,605
MR. SOKOL.
WON'T YOU JOIN US IN OUR TOAST?

1695
01:44:21,606 --> 01:44:25,109
CERTAINLY.

1696
01:44:25,110 --> 01:44:27,111
WHAT WAS IT AGAIN?

1697
01:44:27,112 --> 01:44:31,115
TO LOVE AND HOPE AND
THE SUGARPLUM FAIRY.

1698
01:44:31,116 --> 01:44:33,117
MR. SOKOL, YOU DON'T SEEM
TO HAVE THE ESPRIT D'TOAST THIS EVENING.

1699
01:44:33,118 --> 01:44:35,620
WHY NOT JUST LEAVE US
TO OUR COMFORTING RITUAL.

1700
01:44:35,621 --> 01:44:37,622
NO, NO.
I'D LIKE TO JOIN YOU.

1701
01:44:37,623 --> 01:44:39,624
MAYBE THIS WILL BE MY TICKET
TO FOOL'S PARADISE.

1702
01:44:39,625 --> 01:44:41,627
WHY DON'T YOU TO GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE, ALL RIGHT?

1703
01:44:41,628 --> 01:44:42,127
NO ONE INVITED YOU.

1704
01:44:42,128 --> 01:44:43,629
DAVID.

1705
01:44:43,630 --> 01:44:45,631
ACTUALLY THE SISTERS
DID EARLIER, TO TOAST THE EXPECTANT MOTHER.

1706
01:44:45,632 --> 01:44:49,134
ALTHOUGH NOW, I SEE IT'S SHIFTED
TO THE DISTRAUGHT FIANCEE.

1707
01:44:49,135 --> 01:44:51,637
WE WERE JUST BEING POLITE,
MR. SOKOL.

1708
01:44:51,638 --> 01:44:54,139
NOT REALIZING THE EXTENT OF
YOUR BITTERNESS AND DEPRAVITY.

1709
01:44:54,140 --> 01:44:58,644
NOW, THERE IS A TOAST.
TO BITTERNESS AND DEPRAVITY.

1710
01:44:58,645 --> 01:45:02,649
THEY'RE BASICALLY
THE SAME THING, RIGHT, DOCTOR?

1711
01:45:02,650 --> 01:45:07,654
MR. SOKOL,
YOU REALLY SHOULD LEAVE.

1712
01:45:07,655 --> 01:45:14,655
YES.
PLEASE DO.

1713
01:45:43,693 --> 01:45:45,694
TO LOVE AND HOPE.

1714
01:45:45,695 --> 01:45:46,695
YES.

1715
01:45:46,696 --> 01:45:47,696
TO LOVE AND HOPE.

1716
01:45:47,697 --> 01:45:53,201
TO LOVE AND HOPE.

1717
01:45:53,202 --> 01:45:53,702
GARY.

1718
01:45:53,703 --> 01:45:54,703
NO, NO.

1719
01:45:54,704 --> 01:45:55,704
GARY, STOP.

1720
01:45:55,705 --> 01:45:56,204
STOP THIS.

1721
01:45:56,205 --> 01:45:57,205
STOP IT.

1722
01:45:57,206 --> 01:45:58,708
NO.

1723
01:45:58,709 --> 01:46:01,711
STOP THEM.

1724
01:46:20,732 --> 01:46:22,232
OH MY GOD, HE'S NOT MOVING?

1725
01:46:22,233 --> 01:46:23,734
CAREFUL.
DON'T MOVE HIM.

1726
01:46:23,735 --> 01:46:29,740
DR., CALL A PARAMEDIC.

1727
01:46:29,741 --> 01:46:33,243
OH, MY GOD.

1728
01:46:40,252 --> 01:46:41,753
GOD, DAMN IT.
SOMEBODY CALL AN AMBULANCE.

1729
01:46:41,754 --> 01:46:42,754
YES.

1730
01:46:42,755 --> 01:46:44,756
WAIT. NO. NO. NO.
NO. NO. NO, DARLING.

1731
01:46:44,757 --> 01:46:47,258
HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT NOW,
DARLING.

1732
01:46:47,259 --> 01:46:49,761
HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
WHY DON'T WE JUST WAIT IN HERE?

1733
01:46:49,762 --> 01:46:51,763
SEE, EVERYTHING'S
UNDER CONTROL, OKAY.

1734
01:46:51,764 --> 01:46:53,264
HE'S FALLEN AND STRUCK HIS HEAD.
HE'S UNCONSCIOUS.

1735
01:46:53,265 --> 01:46:54,766
YES, HE'S BLEEDING.

1736
01:46:54,767 --> 01:46:56,268
WHY DON'T YOU PLAY SOMETHING,
DEAR?

1737
01:46:56,269 --> 01:47:02,775
HERE.
COME ON.

1738
01:47:02,776 --> 01:47:04,276
THE SECURITY WILL
BRING YOU TO US.

1739
01:47:04,277 --> 01:47:10,782
YES, PLEASE HURRY.

1740
01:47:43,819 --> 01:47:46,320
DAVID.
DAVID.

1741
01:47:46,321 --> 01:47:49,824
HE'S OVER HERE.

1742
01:47:49,825 --> 01:47:51,325
NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO.

1743
01:47:51,326 --> 01:47:52,828
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO.

1744
01:47:52,829 --> 01:47:57,833
STOP TRYING TO PROTECT ME.
JUST GET OUT OF MY WAY.

1745
01:48:07,844 --> 01:48:11,847
MARCIA?

1746
01:48:11,848 --> 01:48:14,851
MARCIA, I'LL TAKE HER.

1747
01:48:14,852 --> 01:48:20,356
NO, FATHER. WE HAVE HER.
SHE'S SAFE WITH US.

1748
01:48:39,377 --> 01:48:44,381
WE HAVE HER.
SHE'S SAFE WITH US.

1749
01:48:44,382 --> 01:48:44,882
ALL RIGHT?

1750
01:48:44,883 --> 01:48:48,385
YES.

1751
01:48:48,386 --> 01:48:51,389
JUST TAKE HIM UP.

1752
01:48:51,390 --> 01:48:52,891
DAVID.

1753
01:48:52,892 --> 01:48:56,394
STRAP HIM.
STOP.

1754
01:48:56,395 --> 01:48:57,896
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS MAN?

1755
01:48:57,897 --> 01:49:01,399
I AM.
HE'S MY HUSBAND.

1756
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:02,901
DAVID.

1757
01:49:02,902 --> 01:49:04,402
HE HAS A SERIOUS CONCUSSION,
MA'AM.

1758
01:49:04,403 --> 01:49:05,904
HE CAN'T HEAR YOU.

1759
01:49:05,905 --> 01:49:09,909
YES, HE CAN.
I'M HERE, DAVID.

1760
01:49:09,910 --> 01:49:11,410
UH.

1761
01:49:11,411 --> 01:49:15,915
HE HEARS ME.

1762
01:49:15,916 --> 01:49:18,918
STRAP HIM IN.

1763
01:49:18,919 --> 01:49:21,420
EASY UP.

1764
01:49:33,434 --> 01:49:38,938
EASY.
