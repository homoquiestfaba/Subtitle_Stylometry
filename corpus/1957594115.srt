1
00:00:02,016 --> 00:00:04,433
(soft music)

2
00:00:13,374 --> 00:00:17,041
(dramatic orchestral music)

3
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:33,879
(all chattering)

4
00:00:38,143 --> 00:00:40,726
(upbeat music)

5
00:00:44,557 --> 00:00:47,140
(all cheering)

6
00:01:12,587 --> 00:01:13,420
- [Man] Alright.

7
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,289
Come on, let's go!

8
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:15,539
Shoot the ball!

9
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,799
- When did this arrive?

10
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:08,382
- This morning, at orientation.

11
00:02:26,204 --> 00:02:27,037
- Okay, nigger.

12
00:02:27,037 --> 00:02:28,204
Off the bench.

13
00:02:32,788 --> 00:02:34,716
Did you hear me?

14
00:02:34,716 --> 00:02:36,105
- Who you talkin' to?

15
00:02:36,105 --> 00:02:37,898
- You know who I'm talking to.

16
00:02:37,898 --> 00:02:39,172
- Naw, man, you ain't talking to me,

17
00:02:39,172 --> 00:02:41,188
'cause I ain't your nigger.

18
00:02:41,188 --> 00:02:42,188
- Gentlemen,

19
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,872
you mind if I talk to the brother?

20
00:02:56,682 --> 00:02:58,500
Hey, look man, you're new here,

21
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,964
so you wouldn't have known,

22
00:02:59,964 --> 00:03:01,343
which is why you get one chance.

23
00:03:01,343 --> 00:03:05,775
But you need to come over
here and sit with us.

24
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:06,953
You can't sit on this bench.

25
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,086
- Why not?

26
00:03:08,086 --> 00:03:09,044
- Because the Aryan brotherhood

27
00:03:09,044 --> 00:03:10,091
has claimed it for themselves.

28
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:14,067
They're the only ones who
are allowed to sit on it.

29
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:15,234
- That's bull.

30
00:03:22,832 --> 00:03:25,116
- Hey, listen, brother,

31
00:03:25,116 --> 00:03:29,130
I would never let them sit on our bench.

32
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,956
I might let the Chicanos
if they would ask,

33
00:03:30,956 --> 00:03:32,250
which they wouldn't,

34
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,581
I might let the Asians sit on the bench

35
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:35,011
if they would ask, which they wouldn't,

36
00:03:35,011 --> 00:03:37,514
I might even let a drugged
up Okie truck driver

37
00:03:37,514 --> 00:03:40,810
sit on the bench, if the boy can sing.

38
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,461
But I would never,

39
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:43,560
never, man, let one of these

40
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,643
Honky Aryan dirt bags sit on my spit.

41
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,090
Now, you might look at them, look at them,

42
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,189
you might feel sorry for them,

43
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:54,821
'cause the only thing they got
in this cold, black universe

44
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:56,366
is this little bit of bench here, man-

45
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:58,909
- No, first of all, don't
call me brother, man.

46
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:01,469
And second, I know what's
up with this bench.

47
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:02,771
Now, you want them White bastards

48
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:04,507
tell you where to sit, that's on you.

49
00:04:04,507 --> 00:04:06,569
I ain't with that.

50
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:09,236
Get the hell outta my face, man.

51
00:04:14,443 --> 00:04:15,443
- Excuse me.

52
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:19,471
He's all yours.

53
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:22,012
Damn.

54
00:04:23,284 --> 00:04:26,367
A toothache lookin' for a tooth, man,

55
00:04:28,532 --> 00:04:30,909
- Now, you get off the bench

56
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:32,848
or I'm gonna rip off your head.

57
00:04:32,848 --> 00:04:35,431
And I'm gonna stuff it down your neck.

58
00:04:35,431 --> 00:04:36,597
- Aw, now look, I'm
gonna tell you somethin',

59
00:04:36,597 --> 00:04:38,605
I heard this, but I ain't
believin' it 'till I saw it.

60
00:04:38,605 --> 00:04:39,438
- [Man] Oh, yeah?

61
00:04:39,438 --> 00:04:40,271
What's that?

62
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:41,104
- That you're so stupid, man,

63
00:04:41,104 --> 00:04:42,947
if they moved your plate five inches

64
00:04:42,947 --> 00:04:45,453
you'd starve to death.

65
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:46,965
That's what your mama told me

66
00:04:46,965 --> 00:04:49,286
after we finished doin' that thing.

67
00:04:49,286 --> 00:04:50,185
- Security!

68
00:04:50,185 --> 00:04:53,310
(siren blaring)

69
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,513
- [Guard] Get down!

70
00:04:55,513 --> 00:04:57,310
Everyone, get down!

71
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,977
(siren blaring)

72
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:08,039
(upbeat music)

73
00:05:52,248 --> 00:05:54,985
- Well, well, well, ain't you something?

74
00:05:54,985 --> 00:05:57,681
- Hey, man, I look at it like this.

75
00:05:57,681 --> 00:06:00,392
Best thing is to let
'em know from the jump,

76
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:02,003
they don't want to fight with me.

77
00:06:02,003 --> 00:06:03,953
- Oh, they don't want
to fight with you, man.

78
00:06:03,953 --> 00:06:05,287
They want to kill you.

79
00:06:05,287 --> 00:06:06,265
And they will,

80
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,098
first chance they get.

81
00:06:07,098 --> 00:06:08,069
- Yeah, right, right.

82
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:10,428
- Yeah, right, right, right, right,

83
00:06:10,428 --> 00:06:11,345
you'll see.

84
00:06:22,947 --> 00:06:23,780
- Hey, Clay?

85
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,113
- [Clay] Yo?
- Got a minute?

86
00:06:30,163 --> 00:06:31,361
- What?

87
00:06:31,361 --> 00:06:35,444
- The Bookmaker wants a
green light on a brother.

88
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:45,076
- Who you want to stick?

89
00:06:45,076 --> 00:06:45,964
- Williams.

90
00:06:45,964 --> 00:06:46,964
The new kid.

91
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:50,237
- I don't give green lights.

92
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:51,936
- Hey, look, we don't want no trouble.

93
00:06:51,936 --> 00:06:54,909
Everybody pays their
debts, one way or another.

94
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:56,076
You could pay it for him.

95
00:06:56,076 --> 00:06:58,751
- I don't pay other people's debts, man.

96
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,092
- There'll be big trouble
if you stand in the way.

97
00:07:01,092 --> 00:07:03,573
- Look, I don't give green lights.

98
00:07:03,573 --> 00:07:04,993
I don't give red lights.

99
00:07:04,993 --> 00:07:06,146
Somebody goes after a
brother with no cause,

100
00:07:06,146 --> 00:07:07,791
then we're gonna protect him.

101
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,432
Somebody goes after a
brother with a reason,

102
00:07:09,432 --> 00:07:11,071
then the brother'd better protect himself.

103
00:07:11,071 --> 00:07:13,044
Now, I'm not sayin' it's okay,

104
00:07:13,044 --> 00:07:16,373
Just better know what you're doin'.

105
00:07:16,373 --> 00:07:18,460
- Then we understand each other.

106
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,043
- I understand you.

107
00:07:27,106 --> 00:07:28,921
- The Warden wants to see you.

108
00:07:28,921 --> 00:07:29,987
- Look, we've been trying to decide

109
00:07:29,987 --> 00:07:32,187
whether we have a problem here or not.

110
00:07:32,187 --> 00:07:33,065
- Must be.

111
00:07:33,065 --> 00:07:35,646
You don't invite me up here for tea.

112
00:07:35,646 --> 00:07:36,909
- And I've been trying to decide

113
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:40,357
if I can afford two of you in my prison.

114
00:07:40,357 --> 00:07:41,872
- Two of me?

115
00:07:41,872 --> 00:07:43,787
- Your son was just transferred here.

116
00:07:43,787 --> 00:07:44,620
- My son?

117
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,797
Nah, that's impossible.

118
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:52,084
(dramatic music)

119
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,784
Jared Williams?

120
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:02,982
- Yeah, we didn't catch
it at first, either.

121
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,379
He uses his mother's name.

122
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:06,502
But, uh, then we look at
his birth certificate,

123
00:08:06,502 --> 00:08:08,464
and what do we see?

124
00:08:08,464 --> 00:08:10,342
Leonard Clay Junior.

125
00:08:10,342 --> 00:08:12,259
Born Los Angeles, 1967.

126
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,267
Mother, Luanna Clay.

127
00:08:16,377 --> 00:08:18,127
Father, Leonard Clay.

128
00:08:20,328 --> 00:08:21,578
Sound familiar?

129
00:08:29,782 --> 00:08:32,923
- He was five years old
the last time I saw him.

130
00:08:32,923 --> 00:08:35,423
He was such a good little boy,

131
00:08:38,749 --> 00:08:40,312
What's he in for?

132
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,182
- Aggravated Assault.

133
00:08:42,182 --> 00:08:43,580
He got two years.

134
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,024
Should've gotten off by now,

135
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,619
but he got no time off for good behavior,

136
00:08:47,619 --> 00:08:50,909
because there's been no good behavior.

137
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:52,242
- I've seen him.

138
00:08:54,688 --> 00:08:56,886
But I was never like that.

139
00:08:56,886 --> 00:08:58,312
- Oh, yeah you were.

140
00:08:58,312 --> 00:09:00,642
Anyway, he doesn't have
much time left to serve.

141
00:09:00,642 --> 00:09:03,273
He's just been transferred
here from Level Two.

142
00:09:03,273 --> 00:09:05,509
- Why?
- Same old, same old.

143
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:06,425
Fighting.

144
00:09:06,425 --> 00:09:07,258
Inmates, guards.

145
00:09:07,258 --> 00:09:08,091
Anybody.

146
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:08,924
- He doesn't realize what it's like to be

147
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,801
in a Level Three institution.

148
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,739
He thinks he's tough,

149
00:09:12,739 --> 00:09:14,124
but he's butting heads with the

150
00:09:14,124 --> 00:09:17,102
wrong kind of people around here.

151
00:09:17,102 --> 00:09:21,652
We were hoping that
maybe you could help him.

152
00:09:21,652 --> 00:09:24,402
(dramatic music)

153
00:09:43,924 --> 00:09:45,174
- That's right.

154
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:54,989
- Hey, look, uh, I wanna
pay the kid's debt.

155
00:09:54,989 --> 00:09:55,822
- Too late, man.

156
00:09:55,822 --> 00:09:57,072
I've been paid.

157
00:09:58,109 --> 00:09:58,984
- Who would pay you?

158
00:09:58,984 --> 00:09:59,817
- They did.

159
00:09:59,817 --> 00:10:01,045
For the privilege.

160
00:10:01,045 --> 00:10:02,666
They bought the green light.

161
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,050
- I didn't give you the green light.

162
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,749
- Hey, you didn't pay it
when you could've, you know?

163
00:10:05,749 --> 00:10:06,582
I've got my rights.

164
00:10:06,582 --> 00:10:07,415
I had a right to sell it.

165
00:10:07,415 --> 00:10:08,361
Everybody here will back me.

166
00:10:08,361 --> 00:10:10,402
- Yeah, well, you should know
better than to go against me.

167
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,933
- You said you didn't
want to get involved!

168
00:10:12,933 --> 00:10:15,683
What's it to you all of a sudden?

169
00:10:17,303 --> 00:10:18,396
Hey, look, uh,

170
00:10:18,396 --> 00:10:19,954
you can try to buy it back,

171
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:22,214
but I don't think they're sellin'.

172
00:10:22,214 --> 00:10:24,194
- You better hope, for
your sake, that they are.

173
00:10:24,194 --> 00:10:27,039
- Ah, he's not worth it, man.

174
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,539
- Neither are you.

175
00:10:33,681 --> 00:10:36,098
- [Man] You got to set it up!

176
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,083
- Here you go.

177
00:10:42,457 --> 00:10:44,588
- I don't smoke.

178
00:10:44,588 --> 00:10:45,803
- Me neither.

179
00:10:45,803 --> 00:10:47,352
- Why are you carrying them?

180
00:10:47,352 --> 00:10:49,837
- Coin of the realm, man.

181
00:10:49,837 --> 00:10:50,670
Here.

182
00:10:52,834 --> 00:10:53,667
- Naw.

183
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:56,224
- You don't take nothin'
from nobody, do you?

184
00:10:56,224 --> 00:10:59,952
- Why you always suckin' up to me, man?

185
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:00,992
- You know who I am?

186
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:04,038
- Yeah, you're the brother
everybody owes something to.

187
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:04,871
Except me.

188
00:11:06,104 --> 00:11:07,604
- My name is Clay.

189
00:11:08,727 --> 00:11:10,320
First name is Leonard.

190
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,737
I'm from Compton.

191
00:11:12,643 --> 00:11:14,222
I was married once.

192
00:11:14,222 --> 00:11:16,389
My wife's name was Luanna.

193
00:11:17,602 --> 00:11:19,352
Look, I'm your daddy.

194
00:11:32,762 --> 00:11:35,929
(horseshoes clanking)

195
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:40,611
Hey, hey.
- Man!

196
00:11:46,126 --> 00:11:48,043
You stay outta my face.

197
00:11:49,123 --> 00:11:54,123
You lost the title father when
you walked out on us, man.

198
00:11:54,504 --> 00:11:56,516
- Listen, I wanna help you.

199
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:57,843
I want to bring you in here.

200
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:59,328
You ain't gonna make it otherwise.

201
00:11:59,328 --> 00:12:00,828
- It don't matter.

202
00:12:05,088 --> 00:12:06,921
You stay outta my way.

203
00:12:09,321 --> 00:12:10,321
- Hey Jared!

204
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,713
How's your mama?

205
00:12:19,018 --> 00:12:20,101
- She's dead.

206
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:30,378
That's all you need to know.

207
00:12:30,378 --> 00:12:33,128
(dramatic music)

208
00:12:49,272 --> 00:12:51,178
- Hey, I thought we was friends.

209
00:12:51,178 --> 00:12:53,906
How come you didn't tell me you had a son?

210
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,900
- Friends don't make each other hurt.

211
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,397
- Yeah, where'd you hear that?

212
00:12:57,397 --> 00:12:59,114
Somebody been havin' you on?

213
00:12:59,114 --> 00:13:02,058
That's their main talent
once the money's gone.

214
00:13:02,058 --> 00:13:04,351
What else you been holding back on me?

215
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:06,228
- I ain't been holding nothin' back, man.

216
00:13:06,228 --> 00:13:07,061
Just, uh,

217
00:13:08,306 --> 00:13:10,922
never wanted to mention him in here.

218
00:13:10,922 --> 00:13:13,468
I was trying to keep his
world and mine apart.

219
00:13:13,468 --> 00:13:16,546
- Yeah, but Clay, without you,

220
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,183
this world didn't give him a chance.

221
00:13:19,183 --> 00:13:22,482
- I thought his mama
was taking care of him.

222
00:13:22,482 --> 00:13:25,231
I remember she used to
do a pretty good job.

223
00:13:25,231 --> 00:13:26,481
- But she died.

224
00:13:30,132 --> 00:13:30,965
- Yeah,

225
00:13:34,186 --> 00:13:35,890
she had this whole life in my head

226
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,543
that I know now never even existed.

227
00:13:38,543 --> 00:13:40,698
I saw her married again.

228
00:13:40,698 --> 00:13:42,115
More kids, maybe,

229
00:13:43,247 --> 00:13:45,261
Watching Jared play baseball,

230
00:13:45,261 --> 00:13:48,678
going to his graduation, stuff like that.

231
00:13:50,134 --> 00:13:52,884
(shower running)

232
00:14:12,296 --> 00:14:15,296
(suspenseful music)

233
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:24,509
- Hey, boy, hey, boy!

234
00:14:28,696 --> 00:14:29,696
Remember me?

235
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,666
(men clapping)

236
00:14:45,102 --> 00:14:47,852
(man vocalizing)

237
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,266
- You can't ever be alone.

238
00:15:45,266 --> 00:15:48,323
You come to take a shower,
you use that first stall.

239
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,315
If it's busy, you wait.

240
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:53,894
If other people leave, you leave too,

241
00:15:53,894 --> 00:15:56,739
unless you want to be dead.

242
00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:59,489
(dramatic music)

243
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:12,489
- Hey, man, your father, he wants to-

244
00:16:13,784 --> 00:16:16,403
- Don't call him that.

245
00:16:16,403 --> 00:16:18,736
- He covered the 10 cartons.

246
00:16:22,705 --> 00:16:24,532
- Why?
- Guess he figured

247
00:16:24,532 --> 00:16:26,092
he owed you.

248
00:16:26,092 --> 00:16:29,109
- Yeah, well, he owed me then.

249
00:16:29,109 --> 00:16:30,975
It's too late for all that now.

250
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,090
- He saved your life by
paying your gambling debts!

251
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,589
- He bought himself a little peace, man!

252
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:35,422
I ain't-

253
00:16:35,422 --> 00:16:40,005
- He ain't had no peace since
he's known you were here!

254
00:16:41,997 --> 00:16:43,521
Hey, Rico!

255
00:16:43,521 --> 00:16:44,354
From Clay.

256
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,735
- You know, Mr. Clay,

257
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,721
We don't usually give
serious consideration

258
00:16:54,721 --> 00:16:56,676
to someone convicted of murder

259
00:16:56,676 --> 00:17:00,655
until their third or fourth
time before the board.

260
00:17:00,655 --> 00:17:02,836
The public doesn't like it.

261
00:17:02,836 --> 00:17:04,847
We usually just go through the motions.

262
00:17:04,847 --> 00:17:05,680
- Yes, sir.

263
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,356
You're very good at it, too.

264
00:17:07,356 --> 00:17:09,274
- See, we've got a problem.

265
00:17:09,274 --> 00:17:11,390
Under California's
determinate sentence law,

266
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,930
we've got to release your son from prison.

267
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,768
We don't think he's ready for the street,

268
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:19,314
but we have no legal way
to keep him any longer.

269
00:17:19,314 --> 00:17:22,556
The only power we have is to
set the terms of his parole.

270
00:17:22,556 --> 00:17:24,886
- Now, I can tell you from our experience,

271
00:17:24,886 --> 00:17:29,353
this kid's not gonna make
it unless something changes.

272
00:17:29,353 --> 00:17:34,353
- The only change we can
make is to let you out early.

273
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,493
- You're gonna parole me?

274
00:17:36,493 --> 00:17:39,090
- With some conditions.

275
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:43,354
We've decided to make the
two of you live together.

276
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,187
- What?

277
00:17:46,572 --> 00:17:47,589
Oh, no.

278
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:49,306
Don't do that to me.

279
00:17:49,306 --> 00:17:52,923
- You will be under high
control of your parole officer.

280
00:17:52,923 --> 00:17:54,627
You will live in a halfway house

281
00:17:54,627 --> 00:17:57,610
until you get a permanent job.

282
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,097
Both of you will be enjoined

283
00:17:59,097 --> 00:18:00,930
from being within a three-mile radius

284
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,052
of your old neighborhood.

285
00:18:03,052 --> 00:18:05,191
If either of you is caught there,

286
00:18:05,191 --> 00:18:07,989
it will be a category one violation

287
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:12,249
and the violator will
be returned to custody.

288
00:18:12,249 --> 00:18:14,135
Those are the terms.

289
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,204
- If you give me your word,
I think you'll keep it.

290
00:18:16,204 --> 00:18:17,756
And you could make a difference.

291
00:18:17,756 --> 00:18:19,469
- That hardhead won't listen to me.

292
00:18:19,469 --> 00:18:22,207
- The two of you just might
be able to save each other.

293
00:18:22,207 --> 00:18:24,957
(dramatic music)

294
00:19:11,823 --> 00:19:13,354
- Clay?
- Yeah.

295
00:19:13,354 --> 00:19:15,014
- Williams?
- Yeah.

296
00:19:15,014 --> 00:19:15,847
- Good.

297
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:16,959
I'm Rick Torres, your parole officer.

298
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:18,094
- [Jared] We know who you are.

299
00:19:18,094 --> 00:19:19,244
- Sorry, I'm late.

300
00:19:19,244 --> 00:19:22,508
- If there's one thing we do
know how to do, that's wait.

301
00:19:22,508 --> 00:19:24,455
- I understand you're
a father and son team.

302
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,604
- We ain't no team.

303
00:19:26,604 --> 00:19:27,973
- Okay,

304
00:19:27,973 --> 00:19:31,056
let me take you to the halfway house.

305
00:19:41,862 --> 00:19:44,445
(upbeat music)

306
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,492
(all chattering)

307
00:20:05,532 --> 00:20:06,639
Gentlemen, let me remind you,

308
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,578
you're still technically in prison.

309
00:20:09,578 --> 00:20:12,573
From eight a.m. to six p.m.,
you can walk the streets,

310
00:20:12,573 --> 00:20:15,537
look for jobs, I don't care.

311
00:20:15,537 --> 00:20:17,957
At six p.m. you're signed
back into the halfway house

312
00:20:17,957 --> 00:20:19,505
or I file an RTC.

313
00:20:19,505 --> 00:20:21,630
That's a Return To Custody.

314
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,078
When you've got permanent jobs,

315
00:20:23,078 --> 00:20:24,788
you can move out, all
other terms of parole

316
00:20:24,788 --> 00:20:26,455
remaining in effect.

317
00:20:28,051 --> 00:20:30,718
Now every three days we do a UA.

318
00:20:31,854 --> 00:20:34,955
We monitor for alcohol,
Morphine, Cannabinoids,

319
00:20:34,955 --> 00:20:37,334
Barbiturates, Amphetamines, Codeine,

320
00:20:37,334 --> 00:20:39,755
Phencyclidines, and Cocaine.

321
00:20:39,755 --> 00:20:41,933
You come up dirty, you go back.

322
00:20:41,933 --> 00:20:45,390
- Hey, look, I just served
15 years of hard time.

323
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,849
I did it long, I did
it right, but I did it!

324
00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:49,339
Now I'm out and I'm not going to pee

325
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:53,777
in somebody's bottle just to
prove what kind of man I am.

326
00:20:53,777 --> 00:20:55,860
- You don't, you go back.

327
00:20:58,379 --> 00:21:00,555
You think about it,

328
00:21:00,555 --> 00:21:02,977
and let me know your answer.

329
00:21:02,977 --> 00:21:05,727
(dramatic music)

330
00:21:40,657 --> 00:21:42,177
Morning, gentlemen.

331
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:43,972
I made some calls.

332
00:21:43,972 --> 00:21:46,630
It's not easy finding work for you two.

333
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,649
You don't know how to do anything.

334
00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:50,328
And you got a murder rap in your jacket

335
00:21:50,328 --> 00:21:51,732
I have to disclose to my contacts,

336
00:21:51,732 --> 00:21:53,809
otherwise they won't
hire any of my people.

337
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:56,889
So for now, I know a
contractor with some day labor.

338
00:21:56,889 --> 00:21:58,459
Go down to the corner of 18th.

339
00:21:58,459 --> 00:21:59,912
They'll pick you up at seven.

340
00:21:59,912 --> 00:22:02,912
(machines whirring)

341
00:22:05,571 --> 00:22:06,913
- Hey!

342
00:22:06,913 --> 00:22:08,281
Not there, you idiots.

343
00:22:08,281 --> 00:22:09,968
Over there!

344
00:22:09,968 --> 00:22:10,801
Come on!

345
00:22:10,801 --> 00:22:13,598
Let's make some room for traffic.

346
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,891
Hey, you comprende?

347
00:22:15,891 --> 00:22:16,724
Come on!

348
00:22:16,724 --> 00:22:17,557
Move it!

349
00:22:20,513 --> 00:22:21,346
Come on.

350
00:22:26,905 --> 00:22:28,873
Around here, we do things my way.

351
00:22:28,873 --> 00:22:29,956
You got that?

352
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,253
- I'm glad you didn't
take a swing at my son.

353
00:22:50,253 --> 00:22:51,719
- What do you mean?

354
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:52,968
- Well, he likes to fight, you know?

355
00:22:52,968 --> 00:22:55,819
He doesn't understand the kind
of trouble he can get into.

356
00:22:55,819 --> 00:22:57,193
Take me, for example.

357
00:22:57,193 --> 00:23:00,334
I'm out on parole, for murder.

358
00:23:00,334 --> 00:23:02,833
You'd think I'd learned something by now.

359
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:04,401
But I think I'm dumber than ever.

360
00:23:04,401 --> 00:23:06,475
And they say he's just like me.

361
00:23:06,475 --> 00:23:07,468
So I'm glad

362
00:23:07,468 --> 00:23:10,502
that there's somebody with
some sense around here,

363
00:23:10,502 --> 00:23:11,335
like you.

364
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,950
(all chattering)

365
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:29,617
(alarm blaring)

366
00:23:35,741 --> 00:23:39,158
- [Man] I'll send it in about 10 minutes.

367
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:54,872
- Damn!

368
00:23:56,596 --> 00:23:59,679
Is that a fine-lookin' woman or what?

369
00:24:17,377 --> 00:24:20,044
(phone ringing)

370
00:24:28,206 --> 00:24:29,724
- Hello?

371
00:24:29,724 --> 00:24:33,830
Yeah, Mr. Preuss is gonna
be another five minutes.

372
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,580
Uh-huh, okay, thanks.

373
00:24:37,153 --> 00:24:39,153
Mr. Preuss, we gotta go!

374
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:45,410
(engine revs and falters)

375
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,144
- I'd be happy to look
under the hood for you.

376
00:24:57,144 --> 00:24:59,020
- This car's been giving
me a lot of trouble.

377
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,386
I'm gonna call the tow service.

378
00:25:00,386 --> 00:25:01,219
- No, pull the latch.

379
00:25:01,219 --> 00:25:03,201
I'll take a look, see what happens.

380
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:04,034
- All right.

381
00:25:04,034 --> 00:25:05,201
But just look.

382
00:25:13,705 --> 00:25:15,252
- Let's see what we have here.

383
00:25:15,252 --> 00:25:18,230
- These are very delicate,
very complicated engines.

384
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,276
- Oh?

385
00:25:19,276 --> 00:25:20,273
- What is that?

386
00:25:20,273 --> 00:25:21,949
- This is the fimdupter.

387
00:25:21,949 --> 00:25:23,641
I think it's clogged.

388
00:25:23,641 --> 00:25:25,145
If the collibrute can't get any gas,

389
00:25:25,145 --> 00:25:28,108
the whole deculator system goes out.

390
00:25:28,108 --> 00:25:29,039
- Oh.

391
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,163
Are you sure it wasn't the polyplop?

392
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:34,073
(chuckling)

393
00:25:34,073 --> 00:25:36,259
Wait a second, where
are you going with that?

394
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:38,259
- I know what I'm doing.

395
00:25:42,596 --> 00:25:45,096
(air hissing)

396
00:26:08,198 --> 00:26:10,097
- [Mr. Preuss] What's going on?

397
00:26:10,097 --> 00:26:12,180
- The car wouldn't start.

398
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:16,764
- Try it now.

399
00:26:24,502 --> 00:26:26,334
(engine revving)

400
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,917
(upbeat music)

401
00:26:30,233 --> 00:26:31,233
- Thank you.

402
00:26:53,268 --> 00:26:54,101
- Doug?

403
00:26:54,101 --> 00:26:55,440
Yvonne.

404
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,782
I'm calling about the guy

405
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:59,762
that fixed Mr. Preuss' car this afternoon.

406
00:26:59,762 --> 00:27:01,247
Yeah, that's the one.

407
00:27:01,247 --> 00:27:03,670
He doesn't seem like a killer to me.

408
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,095
- Killers usually don't.

409
00:27:05,095 --> 00:27:07,719
And they usually don't kill again.

410
00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:10,660
As we say in the trade,
they killed their problem.

411
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,583
- So, there's no doubt that he did it?

412
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:14,244
- There was some doubt as to why.

413
00:27:14,244 --> 00:27:15,729
I read the court record.

414
00:27:15,729 --> 00:27:17,503
Clay said it was self-defense.

415
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:19,047
Kill or be killed.

416
00:27:19,047 --> 00:27:21,569
- So, why didn't they believe him?

417
00:27:21,569 --> 00:27:23,366
- Well, yeah,

418
00:27:23,366 --> 00:27:27,511
you see, he was a
self-confessed car thief.

419
00:27:27,511 --> 00:27:28,848
- Don't tell me this,

420
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:30,774
- Yes, a slick, best there was,

421
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,756
50 car a month thief.

422
00:27:32,756 --> 00:27:34,332
Only stole the expensive cars.

423
00:27:34,332 --> 00:27:36,600
You know, the kind prosecutors drive.

424
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,515
The kind defense lawyers drive.

425
00:27:38,515 --> 00:27:40,451
The kind judges drive.

426
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:41,599
- So who did he kill?

427
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,540
- A big time fence named Jackson.

428
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,658
Guy didn't chop cars.

429
00:27:44,658 --> 00:27:46,945
He sold 'em whole with new paperwork.

430
00:27:46,945 --> 00:27:48,124
Big profits.

431
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:50,202
- So why did he kill him?

432
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:51,596
- Jackson tried to stiff him.

433
00:27:51,596 --> 00:27:53,425
Clay was going to take the car back.

434
00:27:53,425 --> 00:27:55,276
Jackson pulled a gun.

435
00:27:55,276 --> 00:27:57,184
Clay took it away from him.

436
00:27:57,184 --> 00:27:58,816
Almost.

437
00:27:58,816 --> 00:28:01,583
From then, it's a matter
of interpretation.

438
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:03,468
But the jury bought murder two.

439
00:28:03,468 --> 00:28:04,937
- But what do you think?

440
00:28:04,937 --> 00:28:07,687
- I would've bought self-defense.

441
00:28:09,476 --> 00:28:12,354
- So you don't think I'd
be wasting my time on him.

442
00:28:12,354 --> 00:28:15,900
- If you'd be wasting your
time, I'm wasting my life.

443
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,733
Look.

444
00:28:16,733 --> 00:28:20,124
Clay, his son, they're not sociopaths.

445
00:28:20,124 --> 00:28:22,041
No screws missing.

446
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:26,362
Their psych reports reveal real
human beings, with feelings.

447
00:28:26,362 --> 00:28:27,481
I think Clay is the kind

448
00:28:27,481 --> 00:28:30,564
that can make it if he gets a chance.

449
00:28:32,521 --> 00:28:35,164
- So, when can he come
in for an interview?

450
00:28:35,164 --> 00:28:37,914
(dramatic music)

451
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:41,986
(siren wailing)

452
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:56,941
- Mr. Williams, would you join us, please?

453
00:28:57,971 --> 00:29:00,942
Leonard Clay, I have a job
interview for you tomorrow.

454
00:29:00,942 --> 00:29:02,235
Could be permanent.

455
00:29:02,235 --> 00:29:03,678
I told 'em you're an expert mechanic.

456
00:29:03,678 --> 00:29:04,594
Am I right?

457
00:29:04,594 --> 00:29:06,212
- I'm an expert car thief.

458
00:29:06,212 --> 00:29:08,313
I'm an experienced mechanic.

459
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:12,417
- Clay Junior, are you an expert
or experienced at anything?

460
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,250
- Yeah.

461
00:29:16,475 --> 00:29:18,555
- Yeah, aren't we all.

462
00:29:18,555 --> 00:29:20,521
I got a job for you.

463
00:29:20,521 --> 00:29:21,619
Pay's good.

464
00:29:21,619 --> 00:29:23,502
Don't need experience.

465
00:29:23,502 --> 00:29:26,009
- Anything to get out of
all that dust and heat.

466
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:29,108
- Oh, it's air conditioned, sir.

467
00:29:29,108 --> 00:29:31,691
(upbeat music)

468
00:29:45,904 --> 00:29:48,969
(knocking on door)

469
00:29:48,969 --> 00:29:49,802
- Come in.

470
00:29:54,843 --> 00:29:56,548
- Are you why I'm here?

471
00:29:56,548 --> 00:29:58,839
- Mr. Preuss, aside from
developing buildings,

472
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,084
also owns this dealership.

473
00:30:01,084 --> 00:30:02,679
We're always looking for a good mechanic,

474
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:05,096
so please sit down, Mr. Clay.

475
00:30:07,561 --> 00:30:09,145
Mr. Preuss was very impressed

476
00:30:09,145 --> 00:30:10,985
with the way you fixed his car.

477
00:30:10,985 --> 00:30:12,750
So he had me call our builder

478
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,561
to find out why an
excellent mechanic like you

479
00:30:15,561 --> 00:30:17,988
was working as a common laborer.

480
00:30:17,988 --> 00:30:21,044
And he had me call Mister Torres.

481
00:30:21,044 --> 00:30:21,877
- Ah.

482
00:30:22,964 --> 00:30:26,270
- And he said that while
you were in prison,

483
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,988
you learned how to be a mechanic.

484
00:30:27,988 --> 00:30:30,655
In fact, the best they ever saw.

485
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,461
You're not saying anything.

486
00:30:35,461 --> 00:30:36,813
- No, I try not to interrupt

487
00:30:36,813 --> 00:30:38,937
when people are saying
nice things about me.

488
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:39,770
- [Yvonne] Oh.

489
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:40,603
- So-
- So,

490
00:30:42,024 --> 00:30:43,105
go ahead.

491
00:30:43,105 --> 00:30:47,185
- Well, what, uh, do I
have to do to get the job?

492
00:30:47,185 --> 00:30:48,207
- You've got it.

493
00:30:48,207 --> 00:30:49,844
On a trial basis at first.

494
00:30:49,844 --> 00:30:53,594
But it is permanent if
there are no problems.

495
00:30:55,052 --> 00:30:57,153
- Why you doing this?

496
00:30:57,153 --> 00:30:59,172
- Mr. Preuss would like to help.

497
00:30:59,172 --> 00:31:00,949
- Mr. Preuss?

498
00:31:00,949 --> 00:31:01,782
I see.

499
00:31:03,174 --> 00:31:04,007
Well,

500
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,868
you thank Mr. Preuss for me.

501
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:11,701
- I will.

502
00:31:12,944 --> 00:31:13,777
- Thanks.

503
00:31:14,729 --> 00:31:16,146
- You're welcome.

504
00:31:17,526 --> 00:31:20,109
(upbeat music)

505
00:31:31,545 --> 00:31:33,001
- You said this job was air conditioned.

506
00:31:33,001 --> 00:31:34,466
You didn't say nothin'
about it bein' arctic.

507
00:31:34,466 --> 00:31:35,864
- I know it's hard, brother.

508
00:31:35,864 --> 00:31:37,531
But it's a good job.

509
00:31:40,568 --> 00:31:41,723
Where's your UA?

510
00:31:41,723 --> 00:31:42,731
- I don't need it.

511
00:31:42,731 --> 00:31:43,564
I got the job.

512
00:31:43,564 --> 00:31:44,763
It's permanent unless I mess up.

513
00:31:44,763 --> 00:31:47,476
Which means that we can
move out of here, right?

514
00:31:47,476 --> 00:31:49,309
I've got the money I saved from prison.

515
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:50,142
- Yeah.

516
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:53,057
You still have to drop
off a UA once a week.

517
00:31:53,057 --> 00:31:55,344
But, Let me confirm your job

518
00:31:55,344 --> 00:31:58,083
and I'll have both your
walking papers typed up.

519
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,534
- I ain't going with him.

520
00:31:59,534 --> 00:32:00,725
- Only way out, pal.

521
00:32:00,725 --> 00:32:02,219
Terms of parole.

522
00:32:02,219 --> 00:32:03,052
- Then I'll stay.

523
00:32:03,052 --> 00:32:04,099
- No you won't.

524
00:32:04,099 --> 00:32:05,227
- I'm staying here!

525
00:32:05,227 --> 00:32:06,128
- No you won't!

526
00:32:06,128 --> 00:32:08,084
You listen to me,

527
00:32:08,084 --> 00:32:10,704
They didn't want you out on the streets.

528
00:32:10,704 --> 00:32:12,982
They're just waiting for you to screw up.

529
00:32:12,982 --> 00:32:15,576
You don't move in with
him, you go back now.

530
00:32:15,576 --> 00:32:17,137
- And you can thank your sorry butt

531
00:32:17,137 --> 00:32:20,137
that I'm willing to put up with you.

532
00:32:22,032 --> 00:32:22,865
- Hey!

533
00:32:22,865 --> 00:32:24,704
I haven't finished.

534
00:32:24,704 --> 00:32:27,239
I have jurisdiction over you for one year.

535
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:30,210
You live together, home
every night by 10 p.m.

536
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,532
subject to voice verification.

537
00:32:32,532 --> 00:32:35,115
If I call, you better be there.

538
00:32:36,423 --> 00:32:39,173
(dramatic music)

539
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:50,093
(siren wailing)

540
00:32:56,665 --> 00:32:58,480
- Brother, brother, brother,

541
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,165
you done been in the joint so long,

542
00:33:00,165 --> 00:33:02,301
you forgot how to live in
a thousand square feet.

543
00:33:02,301 --> 00:33:04,036
- I don't like big places.

544
00:33:04,036 --> 00:33:06,026
Don't like people close to me, that's all.

545
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:07,104
- Why we still eating prison food?

546
00:33:07,104 --> 00:33:07,937
- I like beans.

547
00:33:07,937 --> 00:33:09,964
- Well, I can't feel free
if I'm eating prison food.

548
00:33:09,964 --> 00:33:10,874
- You're not supposed to feel free.

549
00:33:10,874 --> 00:33:11,707
You're on probation.

550
00:33:11,707 --> 00:33:13,147
The minute you start feeling free-

551
00:33:13,147 --> 00:33:16,170
- Hey, you don't try to be my jailorman.

552
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,920
You just, step off me, all right?

553
00:33:19,819 --> 00:33:21,457
- I figure it like this,

554
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,230
It ain't gonna take us too
long to lose each other,

555
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,897
bein' as you're an expert at it.

556
00:33:28,325 --> 00:33:29,158
Look here.

557
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:31,884
I wanna get rid of you

558
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,822
just as fast as you wanna get rid of me.

559
00:33:33,822 --> 00:33:35,369
Now all this right here,

560
00:33:35,369 --> 00:33:36,871
it's just for the man, to make him happy.

561
00:33:36,871 --> 00:33:37,809
Just to share space.

562
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:39,144
That's it.

563
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:40,745
- We could try to get to know one another.

564
00:33:40,745 --> 00:33:44,596
- When I was a little
boy, I wanted a father.

565
00:33:44,596 --> 00:33:46,346
I don't want one now.

566
00:33:47,735 --> 00:33:50,836
(phone rings)

567
00:33:50,836 --> 00:33:51,844
- Yeah?

568
00:33:51,844 --> 00:33:52,677
- [Torres] Torres.

569
00:33:52,677 --> 00:33:53,510
Voice verification call.

570
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,481
This Clay?

571
00:33:54,481 --> 00:33:55,836
- Put Jared on the phone.

572
00:33:55,836 --> 00:33:56,669
- Right.

573
00:33:57,566 --> 00:33:58,399
It's Torres.

574
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:59,482
It's for you.

575
00:34:02,905 --> 00:34:03,985
- What up?

576
00:34:03,985 --> 00:34:04,857
- [Torres] Torres.

577
00:34:04,857 --> 00:34:06,478
Voice verification for Jared Williams.

578
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:09,228
- My voice is here.
- That's all.

579
00:34:12,825 --> 00:34:13,658
- Thanks.

580
00:34:16,385 --> 00:34:17,218
Hello.

581
00:34:17,218 --> 00:34:18,051
- Hi.

582
00:34:19,721 --> 00:34:21,531
You know, I was wondering,

583
00:34:21,531 --> 00:34:23,952
uh, maybe one night, uh,

584
00:34:23,952 --> 00:34:24,869
after work,

585
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,656
you might join me for dinner.

586
00:34:30,545 --> 00:34:34,045
- I don't think that would be a good idea.

587
00:34:35,263 --> 00:34:36,096
- Right.

588
00:34:38,742 --> 00:34:39,575
Yeah.

589
00:34:51,364 --> 00:34:53,379
- Whoa, what is that?

590
00:34:53,379 --> 00:34:54,800
- Those are collard greens, boy.

591
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,633
- You serious?

592
00:34:55,633 --> 00:34:56,466
- Yeah.

593
00:34:56,466 --> 00:34:57,762
Eat them with vinegar.

594
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:01,300
- Yeah, Sometimes I think
you're from the South.

595
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,633
(chuckling)

596
00:35:07,444 --> 00:35:08,761
What's wrong with you?

597
00:35:08,761 --> 00:35:10,715
- My mama was from the South.

598
00:35:10,715 --> 00:35:13,485
Now, there was a great woman.

599
00:35:13,485 --> 00:35:15,152
She could sing, man,

600
00:35:16,764 --> 00:35:19,129
make the walls of the church shake.

601
00:35:19,129 --> 00:35:21,201
She loved so hard,

602
00:35:21,201 --> 00:35:23,451
fit just like a tight shoe.

603
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,499
Don't make her mad, now,

604
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,582
you'd much rather suffer a hurricane.

605
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:33,292
- What about your daddy?

606
00:35:33,292 --> 00:35:35,459
- He was from Los Angeles.

607
00:35:39,782 --> 00:35:42,169
- What happened to them?

608
00:35:42,169 --> 00:35:43,926
- Well, my mama died when she was young.

609
00:35:43,926 --> 00:35:45,572
I don't remember my dad too much.

610
00:35:45,572 --> 00:35:49,049
He used to drift in and
out from time to time.

611
00:35:49,049 --> 00:35:50,466
Then he was gone.

612
00:35:58,444 --> 00:36:00,804
- [Woman] Clay, telephone call line four.

613
00:36:00,804 --> 00:36:02,137
Clay, line four.

614
00:36:08,948 --> 00:36:10,641
- Yeah, this is Clay.

615
00:36:10,641 --> 00:36:11,878
- Jared didn't come back to work

616
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,716
at the packing plant this afternoon.

617
00:36:13,716 --> 00:36:15,466
Any idea where he is?

618
00:36:16,766 --> 00:36:18,034
- No.

619
00:36:18,034 --> 00:36:19,337
- I'm going to have to put out a bulletin

620
00:36:19,337 --> 00:36:20,983
in the old neighborhood in
case he goes back there.

621
00:36:20,983 --> 00:36:22,211
- You asking for my blessing?

622
00:36:22,211 --> 00:36:25,043
- C'mon, Clay, let's work
together on him, okay?

623
00:36:25,043 --> 00:36:26,691
- I'm not gonna be his police man.

624
00:36:26,691 --> 00:36:27,785
- I'll be his cop.

625
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:29,451
You just be his dad.

626
00:36:29,451 --> 00:36:30,350
Take it easy.

627
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,183
- Yeah.

628
00:36:48,747 --> 00:36:51,664
(knocking on door)

629
00:37:07,648 --> 00:37:08,481
- Hey, uh,

630
00:37:10,158 --> 00:37:13,241
you kids here know where Sharon's at?

631
00:37:17,544 --> 00:37:18,877
Hey, little man,

632
00:37:20,887 --> 00:37:22,702
How you doing?

633
00:37:22,702 --> 00:37:24,747
Sharon still live over there?

634
00:37:24,747 --> 00:37:25,663
- I don't know.

635
00:37:25,663 --> 00:37:27,481
Hey, give me a ride.

636
00:37:27,481 --> 00:37:29,380
- You want a ride?

637
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,038
You want a ride?

638
00:37:31,038 --> 00:37:32,078
You don't want a ride?

639
00:37:32,078 --> 00:37:33,995
- Hey, can you do this?

640
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:39,108
- Wanna get down?

641
00:37:39,108 --> 00:37:39,941
- Can you do this?

642
00:37:39,941 --> 00:37:42,858
- Yeah, what'cha got, what'cha got?

643
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:45,125
- Aw, man,

644
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,467
watch this, watch this.

645
00:37:53,328 --> 00:37:55,322
Now, that's how it's done.

646
00:37:55,322 --> 00:37:57,322
Aw, you don't like that?

647
00:37:59,191 --> 00:38:01,507
Hey, miss thing, miss thing,

648
00:38:01,507 --> 00:38:03,353
Hey, girl, bring your
little bootie over here.

649
00:38:03,353 --> 00:38:04,249
- [Girl] No.

650
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:05,769
- Come here girl, let
me show you something.

651
00:38:05,769 --> 00:38:06,711
- Come here, come here.

652
00:38:06,711 --> 00:38:07,544
- No.

653
00:38:08,624 --> 00:38:10,342
- You leave her alone!

654
00:38:10,342 --> 00:38:11,675
Leave her alone!

655
00:38:13,936 --> 00:38:16,519
- Uh, Miss Brown, how ya doin'?

656
00:38:18,537 --> 00:38:20,262
You was watchin' me the whole time, huh?

657
00:38:20,262 --> 00:38:21,516
- I've been watching you, all right,

658
00:38:21,516 --> 00:38:24,864
to make sure you leave
without causin' any trouble.

659
00:38:24,864 --> 00:38:27,719
- Yeah, well, I came by to see Sharon.

660
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:29,654
- I bet you did.

661
00:38:29,654 --> 00:38:31,155
I just bet you did.

662
00:38:31,155 --> 00:38:32,400
Well, she ain't here.

663
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,650
She moved away.

664
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:35,706
- Where to?

665
00:38:35,706 --> 00:38:36,923
- Never you mind.

666
00:38:36,923 --> 00:38:37,956
Out of the state.

667
00:38:37,956 --> 00:38:40,297
Where you will never find her.

668
00:38:40,297 --> 00:38:41,502
She's goin' to school.

669
00:38:41,502 --> 00:38:43,232
She's goin' to make somethin' of herself.

670
00:38:43,232 --> 00:38:44,936
Not like you.

671
00:38:44,936 --> 00:38:45,936
- What's up?

672
00:38:47,355 --> 00:38:49,313
How come you never liked me?

673
00:38:49,313 --> 00:38:51,522
- Don't ask me to count the ways.

674
00:38:51,522 --> 00:38:53,140
Now, you just be gettin' out of here

675
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,390
before I start dialin' 911.

676
00:38:58,216 --> 00:39:00,211
- Hey, just, just,

677
00:39:00,211 --> 00:39:02,228
tell Sharon I'll never
forget her, all right?

678
00:39:02,228 --> 00:39:06,978
- And she'll never forget you
either, you son-of-a-bitch.

679
00:39:08,659 --> 00:39:11,326
(siren wailing)

680
00:39:26,608 --> 00:39:28,441
- Alright, thanks man.

681
00:39:33,695 --> 00:39:36,331
Man, I don't think there's girls.

682
00:39:36,331 --> 00:39:39,831
Let's go in and find out what's happening.

683
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:08,934
- Leave it alone.

684
00:40:08,934 --> 00:40:10,416
Don't ask.
- I won't.

685
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:11,806
- But you want to know, don't you?

686
00:40:11,806 --> 00:40:14,307
- It's probably the last
thing I want to know.

687
00:40:14,307 --> 00:40:15,731
And don't be screwin' up out there

688
00:40:15,731 --> 00:40:17,731
thinkin' you're going to get to me.

689
00:40:17,731 --> 00:40:19,427
It's you you're gonna get to.

690
00:40:19,427 --> 00:40:21,529
(phone ringing)

691
00:40:21,529 --> 00:40:22,677
- Torres, it's 10 o'clock.

692
00:40:22,677 --> 00:40:24,779
You know where your telephone book's at?

693
00:40:24,779 --> 00:40:26,142
- [Torres] Put Clay on the phone.

694
00:40:26,142 --> 00:40:26,975
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

695
00:40:26,975 --> 00:40:29,725
He wants to hear your voice, too.

696
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,590
(dramatic music)

697
00:41:04,032 --> 00:41:04,865
- Get in.

698
00:41:04,865 --> 00:41:06,293
I'll give you a lift.

699
00:41:06,293 --> 00:41:08,193
For a man who works on some
of the world's best cars,

700
00:41:08,193 --> 00:41:09,810
you shouldn't have to ride the bus.

701
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:10,984
- Well, look at you,

702
00:41:10,984 --> 00:41:14,006
all shiny and air-conditioned
and everything.

703
00:41:14,006 --> 00:41:17,592
- They let some of the
employees drive the demo cars.

704
00:41:17,592 --> 00:41:18,894
This is a perk.

705
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:22,136
- Somebody sure forgot to perk me.

706
00:41:22,136 --> 00:41:24,715
- So what about that
dinner you promised me?

707
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:26,798
- I thought you said
it wasn't a good idea?

708
00:41:26,798 --> 00:41:28,120
- It isn't.

709
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,037
But get in.

710
00:41:37,915 --> 00:41:40,222
You know, you're a lot
brighter than most of the guys

711
00:41:40,222 --> 00:41:42,177
I met in college.

712
00:41:42,177 --> 00:41:44,233
Why didn't that happen for you?

713
00:41:44,233 --> 00:41:45,780
- Where'd you grow up?

714
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,787
- Not far from Compton.

715
00:41:46,787 --> 00:41:48,016
Baldwin Hills.

716
00:41:48,016 --> 00:41:52,931
- (scoffing) Lady, that's
a million miles away.

717
00:41:52,931 --> 00:41:54,366
- You would have done well.

718
00:41:54,366 --> 00:41:55,240
I'm sure of it.

719
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,446
- For what?

720
00:41:56,446 --> 00:41:58,342
You're a college graduate, aren't you?

721
00:41:58,342 --> 00:42:00,593
- Yes.
- How much you get paid?

722
00:42:00,593 --> 00:42:02,801
- That's not the point.
- Are you paid

723
00:42:02,801 --> 00:42:03,931
more than a secretary?

724
00:42:03,931 --> 00:42:04,947
- Not much.

725
00:42:04,947 --> 00:42:06,988
But I have a lot of responsibilities.

726
00:42:06,988 --> 00:42:09,525
- Oh, so you are exploited
and underpaid now.

727
00:42:09,525 --> 00:42:11,970
- I'm getting valuable experience.

728
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,293
- So you can be even more qualified

729
00:42:13,293 --> 00:42:14,629
for the next job you're underpaid at.

730
00:42:14,629 --> 00:42:17,332
- Do you enjoy being cynical?

731
00:42:17,332 --> 00:42:19,249
- No, I don't enjoy it.

732
00:42:23,188 --> 00:42:24,021
So,

733
00:42:26,045 --> 00:42:29,481
you changed your mind
because you think I'm bright?

734
00:42:29,481 --> 00:42:32,890
I can't imagine why a woman
like you is not married.

735
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:34,106
- I was.

736
00:42:34,106 --> 00:42:35,622
For three years.

737
00:42:35,622 --> 00:42:37,546
Two of which I spent
trying to find the courage

738
00:42:37,546 --> 00:42:39,879
to admit I'd made a mistake.

739
00:42:40,926 --> 00:42:43,914
You know, it's hard to
find the right person.

740
00:42:43,914 --> 00:42:45,579
- Oh, yeah, I know.

741
00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:48,192
It's a cold, cruel world out there.

742
00:42:48,192 --> 00:42:49,775
You gotta be tough.

743
00:42:50,709 --> 00:42:51,908
- Yeah.

744
00:42:51,908 --> 00:42:52,741
Tough.

745
00:42:53,692 --> 00:42:54,859
And dangerous.

746
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:58,012
You like being dangerous, don't you?

747
00:42:58,012 --> 00:42:59,729
- Hey, I'm not dangerous.

748
00:42:59,729 --> 00:43:00,562
I'm irate.

749
00:43:01,565 --> 00:43:02,999
- What's the difference?

750
00:43:02,999 --> 00:43:06,585
A dangerous man is dangerous
even when he's not irate.

751
00:43:06,585 --> 00:43:09,804
- So why don't you try not being irate,

752
00:43:09,804 --> 00:43:11,554
and see what happens?

753
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,995
(both laughing)

754
00:43:34,506 --> 00:43:35,721
It's nice.

755
00:43:35,721 --> 00:43:38,294
You chose a nice place to live.

756
00:43:38,294 --> 00:43:40,804
- Yeah, but nobody knows anybody here.

757
00:43:40,804 --> 00:43:44,287
In the joint, I knew just about everybody.

758
00:43:44,287 --> 00:43:47,954
Knew about their families,
about their kids,

759
00:43:49,289 --> 00:43:51,201
about their mistakes,

760
00:43:51,201 --> 00:43:54,181
- You sound like you miss it.

761
00:43:54,181 --> 00:43:55,848
- I miss my friends.

762
00:43:58,532 --> 00:44:00,889
You mind if I kiss you?

763
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:03,126
- Do you usually ask?

764
00:44:03,126 --> 00:44:06,270
- Usually doesn't enter into it.

765
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:07,853
It's been 15 years.

766
00:44:13,409 --> 00:44:14,659
- I don't mind.

767
00:44:30,291 --> 00:44:31,291
- Oh, woman.

768
00:44:34,265 --> 00:44:37,326
You are everything I
imagined a beauty to be.

769
00:44:37,326 --> 00:44:39,689
- I'm attracted to you, too, Clay.

770
00:44:39,689 --> 00:44:42,628
But this is moving too fast.

771
00:44:42,628 --> 00:44:44,852
- Why should I be in such a hurry?

772
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:47,687
- Because, because you've been in prison.

773
00:44:47,687 --> 00:44:50,553
And I think you'd fall in
love with just about anybody.

774
00:44:50,553 --> 00:44:52,046
- You undersell yourself.

775
00:44:52,046 --> 00:44:53,486
- I don't mean to.

776
00:44:53,486 --> 00:44:56,305
I'm just afraid of the
way you'll react to me.

777
00:44:56,305 --> 00:45:00,583
I mean, the earth will move,
and we'll both be overwhelmed.

778
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:02,548
And then I won't know what it means.

779
00:45:02,548 --> 00:45:04,766
- It's not about meaning here.

780
00:45:04,766 --> 00:45:06,700
It's about feelings.

781
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,533
And it will feel good.

782
00:45:13,947 --> 00:45:18,302
- (sighing) I better go home.

783
00:45:18,302 --> 00:45:20,587
- You think I'll be less horny if we wait?

784
00:45:20,587 --> 00:45:23,337
- I'll be less afraid if we wait.

785
00:45:31,523 --> 00:45:35,856
- I never knew anybody who'd
be less afraid to wait.

786
00:45:38,107 --> 00:45:39,104
- Goodnight.

787
00:45:39,104 --> 00:45:40,104
- Goodnight.

788
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:11,676
- Who was she?

789
00:46:11,676 --> 00:46:13,426
Who brought you home?

790
00:46:17,328 --> 00:46:18,905
- Where'd you get that?

791
00:46:18,905 --> 00:46:19,738
- Oh, this.

792
00:46:19,738 --> 00:46:20,571
This here,

793
00:46:20,571 --> 00:46:23,006
This is God's way of telling
me I've been too sober.

794
00:46:23,006 --> 00:46:24,759
- You know, if they
find alcohol in your UA,

795
00:46:24,759 --> 00:46:26,062
you're gonna be busted!

796
00:46:26,062 --> 00:46:27,862
- Aw, man, it's three
days till my next one.

797
00:46:27,862 --> 00:46:28,997
It'll be gone by then.

798
00:46:28,997 --> 00:46:30,557
Can I just ask you who was she?

799
00:46:30,557 --> 00:46:32,321
- Stay outta my private life.

800
00:46:32,321 --> 00:46:33,663
You look to your own.

801
00:46:33,663 --> 00:46:35,246
Look at this place.

802
00:46:37,222 --> 00:46:39,472
I will not live like a pig.

803
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,358
Now, you listen to me.

804
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:45,620
Nobody ever, ever,

805
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,437
disrespects me in my own house.

806
00:46:47,437 --> 00:46:48,931
- This ain't your house, boy!

807
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,261
You ain't never had no house.

808
00:46:51,261 --> 00:46:53,081
And for all the respect
my mama showed you,

809
00:46:53,081 --> 00:46:54,426
you couldn't even pay the rent.

810
00:46:54,426 --> 00:46:56,240
Let me tell you what you
can do with your respect.

811
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,939
You can stick that where
the sun ain't shined

812
00:46:57,939 --> 00:47:00,522
since you been locked up, punk!

813
00:47:02,825 --> 00:47:03,804
- You're ready to go back.

814
00:47:03,804 --> 00:47:05,328
- [Jared] Get the hell outta
my face with that crap!

815
00:47:05,328 --> 00:47:06,660
- Yeah, that's what that is,

816
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,410
you're ready to quit.

817
00:47:11,467 --> 00:47:12,800
- You want some?

818
00:47:13,805 --> 00:47:14,638
Come on!

819
00:47:14,638 --> 00:47:15,471
Come on!

820
00:47:19,851 --> 00:47:22,601
(Jared grunting)

821
00:47:25,377 --> 00:47:26,210
You want something?

822
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:27,043
Come here!

823
00:47:28,713 --> 00:47:31,080
(door clicking)

824
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,729
- Hi.

825
00:47:32,729 --> 00:47:35,370
Hope I'm not interrupting anything.

826
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:37,170
Happened to be in the neighborhood.

827
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:39,389
Thought I'd drop in.

828
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:43,472
The door was open and you
didn't answer the bell.

829
00:47:48,251 --> 00:47:50,758
So, what's going on here?

830
00:47:50,758 --> 00:47:51,819
- Nothin'.

831
00:47:51,819 --> 00:47:54,435
Just a little redecorating.

832
00:47:54,435 --> 00:47:56,799
- That's funny, looked to
me like you were fighting.

833
00:47:56,799 --> 00:47:58,691
- Well, you know how
redecorating can be stressful

834
00:47:58,691 --> 00:48:01,032
on a relationship there, Torres.

835
00:48:01,032 --> 00:48:05,075
- Yeah, well, let me help you out on this.

836
00:48:05,075 --> 00:48:08,166
You, your job is the living room.

837
00:48:08,166 --> 00:48:10,630
You keep it clean, you keep it picked up.

838
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:12,773
I come by, see some crap on the floor,

839
00:48:12,773 --> 00:48:16,248
you go back to jail no matter who did it.

840
00:48:16,248 --> 00:48:17,256
You.

841
00:48:17,256 --> 00:48:18,527
The kitchen, the bathroom.

842
00:48:18,527 --> 00:48:19,524
Same terms.

843
00:48:19,524 --> 00:48:22,995
I find you keep those three rooms working,

844
00:48:22,995 --> 00:48:24,995
people stay out of jail.

845
00:48:26,552 --> 00:48:27,635
See you soon.

846
00:48:34,107 --> 00:48:36,808
- You think he saw these cans?

847
00:48:36,808 --> 00:48:37,641
- Naw.

848
00:48:37,641 --> 00:48:39,141
He didn't see 'em.

849
00:48:41,013 --> 00:48:43,827
- Why you got to be so sure
about everything you say?

850
00:48:43,827 --> 00:48:45,530
- Well, you usually don't say
anything unless you're sure.

851
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:48,306
- Well, why don't you say
something that's real?

852
00:48:48,306 --> 00:48:49,333
Why don't you say somethin',

853
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:50,411
why don't you say somethin' about how come

854
00:48:50,411 --> 00:48:52,687
I never heard from you my whole life?

855
00:48:52,687 --> 00:48:53,765
How come,

856
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:55,967
I didn't get not one letter from you, man.

857
00:48:55,967 --> 00:48:57,369
Not a birthday card, nothin'!

858
00:48:57,369 --> 00:48:59,247
- What would you do if I'd
sent you a birthday card?

859
00:48:59,247 --> 00:49:00,080
- I would have spit on it.

860
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,541
- Right!
- I would have tore it up.

861
00:49:01,541 --> 00:49:03,486
But at least I would have-

862
00:49:03,486 --> 00:49:05,319
- You would have what?

863
00:49:06,497 --> 00:49:09,664
- I would have had you to be angry at.

864
00:49:12,598 --> 00:49:15,943
It's hard to scream at a photograph.

865
00:49:15,943 --> 00:49:18,693
(dramatic music)

866
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,340
- [Woman] Service rider,
pick up line four.

867
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,622
Service rider, pick up line four.

868
00:49:54,622 --> 00:49:55,955
- Black, please.

869
00:49:56,862 --> 00:49:59,161
- Don't you have a coffee
pot in your office?

870
00:49:59,161 --> 00:50:00,572
- No, I thought I'd come out here

871
00:50:00,572 --> 00:50:03,754
and have the really good stuff.

872
00:50:03,754 --> 00:50:06,596
I kind of had the impression
that you're avoiding me.

873
00:50:06,596 --> 00:50:08,847
- I thought you couldn't handle it.

874
00:50:08,847 --> 00:50:10,350
- I just need to get to know you better.

875
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:11,183
- Oh, yeah?

876
00:50:11,183 --> 00:50:12,016
Well, how do we do that?

877
00:50:12,016 --> 00:50:13,603
I take you to the movies,
we watch other people talk

878
00:50:13,603 --> 00:50:15,927
and then we get to know each other better?

879
00:50:15,927 --> 00:50:17,012
- No.

880
00:50:17,012 --> 00:50:20,845
Why don't you come over
and fix my motorcycle?

881
00:50:23,198 --> 00:50:24,833
So, do you think you can make it run?

882
00:50:24,833 --> 00:50:27,862
- Nothing really wrong with it
except it hasn't been driven.

883
00:50:27,862 --> 00:50:28,745
- Why don't you take it for a ride

884
00:50:28,745 --> 00:50:31,078
and see if that's all it is.

885
00:50:33,937 --> 00:50:36,166
- Why you so nice to me?

886
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:38,363
- Hasn't anybody ever been
like that to you before?

887
00:50:38,363 --> 00:50:39,219
- A couple of people.

888
00:50:39,219 --> 00:50:40,052
My mama.

889
00:50:41,457 --> 00:50:42,290
- And your wife?

890
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:43,476
- Yeah.

891
00:50:43,476 --> 00:50:47,059
But she didn't know
what you know about me.

892
00:50:49,295 --> 00:50:51,192
You one of those people who gets off

893
00:50:51,192 --> 00:50:53,141
on knowin' a killer?

894
00:50:53,141 --> 00:50:54,790
- Don't you say that to me!

895
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:56,302
Don't you ever say that to me.

896
00:50:56,302 --> 00:50:57,582
Don't even think it!

897
00:50:57,582 --> 00:51:00,499
I hate killing and I hate violence.

898
00:51:01,979 --> 00:51:05,742
I, I find it hard to believe
that you even killed somebody.

899
00:51:05,742 --> 00:51:08,161
- You better believe it.

900
00:51:08,161 --> 00:51:10,635
- I know why you won't tell me about it.

901
00:51:10,635 --> 00:51:12,391
You don't want to be forgiven.

902
00:51:12,391 --> 00:51:13,600
You don't forgive yourself

903
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,880
because you lost your
family by what you did.

904
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,213
- Where'd you get this bike?

905
00:51:21,224 --> 00:51:24,141
- It belonged to somebody who died.

906
00:51:27,822 --> 00:51:30,322
(engine revs)

907
00:51:33,059 --> 00:51:35,976
(soft jazzy music)

908
00:52:04,483 --> 00:52:06,480
(Leonard growls)

909
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,397
(Leonard laughing)

910
00:52:21,357 --> 00:52:24,333
(laughing)

911
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:25,166
- Wow!

912
00:52:30,234 --> 00:52:32,317
Alright, who was the man?

913
00:52:33,696 --> 00:52:35,067
- Ah!

914
00:52:35,067 --> 00:52:36,814
You're jealous of a dead man?

915
00:52:36,814 --> 00:52:38,669
- There's no way I can fight a dead man.

916
00:52:38,669 --> 00:52:42,795
- Well, you don't have to,
because he was my brother.

917
00:52:42,795 --> 00:52:44,378
He was a great kid.

918
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:47,262
I loved him so much.

919
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,718
If he'd lived, he would've
been a lot like you.

920
00:52:50,718 --> 00:52:52,385
Angry, holding back,

921
00:52:53,459 --> 00:52:56,792
saying, "Heart, don't wound me anymore."

922
00:52:58,094 --> 00:53:00,072
- So what happened to him?

923
00:53:00,072 --> 00:53:02,326
- He went to prison.

924
00:53:02,326 --> 00:53:06,630
They said he was gonna
be out in six months.

925
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:09,880
And then they said he attacked a guard.

926
00:53:10,866 --> 00:53:12,449
And then they said,

927
00:53:16,179 --> 00:53:18,012
they said he was dead.

928
00:53:21,008 --> 00:53:24,171
I was ashamed of him when he was alive.

929
00:53:24,171 --> 00:53:27,838
I didn't know what I
had until I'd lost him.

930
00:53:31,894 --> 00:53:35,051
I want you to have his bike.

931
00:53:35,051 --> 00:53:37,409
- Oh, I can't just take the bike.

932
00:53:37,409 --> 00:53:39,259
I tell you what, I'll pay you for it.

933
00:53:39,259 --> 00:53:40,363
- No.

934
00:53:40,363 --> 00:53:41,793
Clay, it's not for sale.

935
00:53:41,793 --> 00:53:44,409
I know you don't want
to owe anybody anything.

936
00:53:44,409 --> 00:53:46,745
But nobody can get through life alone.

937
00:53:46,745 --> 00:53:51,412
So if you want this bike, you
have to take it as a gift.

938
00:53:58,552 --> 00:54:00,190
- All right.

939
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:01,023
But first,

940
00:54:03,835 --> 00:54:05,502
let me cook for you.

941
00:54:06,449 --> 00:54:09,532
And then you can meet my son.
- Okay.

942
00:54:12,607 --> 00:54:15,607
(soft guitar music)

943
00:54:24,508 --> 00:54:27,091
(door jingles)

944
00:54:40,047 --> 00:54:41,212
- Hello.

945
00:54:41,212 --> 00:54:42,345
How are you?

946
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:45,553
Everything's on special for Father's Day.

947
00:54:45,553 --> 00:54:46,789
Look at these wallets.

948
00:54:46,789 --> 00:54:48,156
Hand tooled.

949
00:54:48,156 --> 00:54:49,649
The best.

950
00:54:49,649 --> 00:54:51,239
- No, no, forget it.

951
00:54:51,239 --> 00:54:53,190
That's all right.

952
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:56,203
- If there's something
important you want to say,

953
00:54:56,203 --> 00:54:57,966
a thank you or an apology,

954
00:54:57,966 --> 00:55:00,172
or a "remember-when-kind-of-thing",

955
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:01,828
say it with gold.

956
00:55:01,828 --> 00:55:03,746
Everyone is impressed by gold.

957
00:55:03,746 --> 00:55:04,940
A nice chain, maybe.

958
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:06,523
50% off today.

959
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:20,315
- Hey, man!

960
00:55:20,315 --> 00:55:21,773
- Where you been?

961
00:55:21,773 --> 00:55:26,333
You forget we were expecting
somebody for dinner?

962
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:27,470
- Yeah, yeah, look,

963
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:28,303
you're here.

964
00:55:28,303 --> 00:55:29,534
She's here.

965
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:30,729
What you need me for?

966
00:55:30,729 --> 00:55:31,897
- I'm Yvonne.

967
00:55:31,897 --> 00:55:33,749
I've heard so much
about you from your dad-

968
00:55:33,749 --> 00:55:35,425
- Yeah, well, he don't
know nothin' about me.

969
00:55:35,425 --> 00:55:38,030
And I'm sure you don't
know nothin' about him.

970
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:40,038
- Hey, don't do this.
- Don't you do this!

971
00:55:40,038 --> 00:55:41,326
I mean, look at you, man.

972
00:55:41,326 --> 00:55:42,198
Look at this.

973
00:55:42,198 --> 00:55:45,092
You up in here livin' large
like ain't nothin' happened.

974
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:46,796
You know, my mother waited her whole life

975
00:55:46,796 --> 00:55:49,129
for you to come back to her.

976
00:55:50,137 --> 00:55:53,109
What is it that you
women see in him anyway?

977
00:55:53,109 --> 00:55:55,852
Can't you see that all
he does is hurt people?

978
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,051
- I'd better go.

979
00:55:57,051 --> 00:55:59,006
- No, no, no, no, baby, stay.

980
00:55:59,006 --> 00:56:00,128
I better go.

981
00:56:00,128 --> 00:56:03,523
'Cause, see, there ain't never
been any room for me, anyway.

982
00:56:03,523 --> 00:56:06,309
Just do me a favor, alright, sweetheart?

983
00:56:06,309 --> 00:56:07,902
Don't love him.

984
00:56:07,902 --> 00:56:08,735
Or else he'll hurt you

985
00:56:08,735 --> 00:56:12,681
just like he done did to everyone else.

986
00:56:12,681 --> 00:56:14,264
Alright, beautiful?

987
00:56:23,824 --> 00:56:25,120
- He's jealous.

988
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,378
- Of what?

989
00:56:26,378 --> 00:56:27,709
- Of me.

990
00:56:27,709 --> 00:56:28,662
- He hates me.

991
00:56:28,662 --> 00:56:31,829
- No, that's not what that feels like.

992
00:56:32,727 --> 00:56:34,467
I'm gonna go.

993
00:56:34,467 --> 00:56:35,634
- Please stay.

994
00:56:36,983 --> 00:56:39,440
- No, I don't want to
come between you two.

995
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,355
He needs you, and you need him.

996
00:56:41,355 --> 00:56:42,947
You need to work it out with him.

997
00:56:42,947 --> 00:56:45,697
Otherwise, I don't have a chance.

998
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,989
I hope you work it out.

999
00:56:52,989 --> 00:56:53,822
Goodnight.

00:59:08,623 --> 00:59:09,728

1028
00:59:12,685 --> 00:59:14,525
- Hell, give him the same as us.

1029
00:59:14,525 --> 00:59:15,965
We'll buy.

1030
00:59:15,965 --> 00:59:16,978
- That's okay.

1031
00:59:16,978 --> 00:59:19,442
- You're too good to drink with us?

1032
00:59:19,442 --> 00:59:21,775
- No, I'll just have a beer.

1033
00:59:25,456 --> 00:59:26,997
- Hey, man!

1034
00:59:26,997 --> 00:59:29,435
I know why you look familiar.

1035
00:59:29,435 --> 00:59:32,454
I think I was bowling with you.

1036
00:59:32,454 --> 00:59:34,954
I think your head was my ball.

1037
00:59:35,938 --> 00:59:37,522
- No, it wasn't bowling.

1038
00:59:37,522 --> 00:59:39,245
It was pool.

1039
00:59:39,245 --> 00:59:42,162
- Yeah, and you was the eight ball.

1040
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:44,411
Whoa!

1041
00:59:44,411 --> 00:59:45,656
Look at that.

1042
00:59:45,656 --> 00:59:47,488
And what do you shine it with?

1043
00:59:47,488 --> 00:59:51,675
And do you know the difference
between it and Shinola?

1044

1045
00:59:54,037 --> 00:59:55,787

Hello, Yvonne?

It's me.

1048
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:04,892
Still not home?

1049
01:00:06,383 --> 01:00:07,216
Listen, I,

1050
01:00:08,888 --> 01:00:11,506
I won't be able to come
to work for a couple days.

1051
01:00:11,506 --> 01:00:14,211
I don't want to lose that job.

1052
01:00:14,211 --> 01:00:17,820
I'll explain it to you when I see you.

1053
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:21,903
I don't know when I'll be
able to call you again.

1054
01:00:24,452 --> 01:00:25,285
Goodbye.

01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:33,913

1057
01:00:40,989 --> 01:00:42,128
- Yeah?

1058
01:00:42,128 --> 01:00:43,653
- Jared, this is Torres.

1059
01:00:43,653 --> 01:00:45,412
Glad you're home, at least.

1060
01:00:45,412 --> 01:00:46,832
We've got a problem with your dad.

1061
01:00:46,832 --> 01:00:48,006
Parole violation.

1062
01:00:48,006 --> 01:00:49,834
We're gonna have to hold him for a while.

1063
01:00:49,834 --> 01:00:51,856
- So, what else is new?

1064
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:52,981
- The question is, are
you gonna be all right

1065
01:00:52,981 --> 01:00:54,358
until he gets home?

1066
01:00:54,358 --> 01:00:57,358
- Hey, Torres, I'm always all right.

1067
01:00:58,638 --> 01:01:01,388

1068
01:01:05,925 --> 01:01:08,592

(doorbell ringing)

1070
01:01:13,552 --> 01:01:14,992
- Who is it?

1071
01:01:14,992 --> 01:01:17,575
- [Torres] Parole Agent Torres.

1072
01:01:19,698 --> 01:01:20,648
- Mr. Torres,

1073
01:01:20,648 --> 01:01:23,378
don't you call people
before you drop in on them?

1074
01:01:23,378 --> 01:01:27,693
- No, that technique doesn't
work well in my profession.

1075
01:01:27,693 --> 01:01:28,860
- Oh, come in.

1076
01:01:30,768 --> 01:01:32,614
- Has he called you yet?

1077
01:01:32,614 --> 01:01:33,447
- He tried.

1078
01:01:33,447 --> 01:01:35,987
I wasn't in, and then he tried again.

1079
01:01:35,987 --> 01:01:37,661
- And you didn't take the call.

1080
01:01:37,661 --> 01:01:38,494
- No.

1081
01:01:39,857 --> 01:01:41,088
So what did he do?

1082
01:01:41,088 --> 01:01:42,907
- He took a drink.

1083
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:44,427
- Is that such a big deal?

1084
01:01:44,427 --> 01:01:46,003
- It looked worse at first.

1085
01:01:46,003 --> 01:01:47,856
Police thought he hit a guy,

1086
01:01:47,856 --> 01:01:50,187
but the drunk just fell off his bar stool.

1087
01:01:50,187 --> 01:01:52,288
- Well, you must have worse offenders.

1088
01:01:52,288 --> 01:01:54,065
- Yeah, but they're not worth the effort.

1089
01:01:54,065 --> 01:01:56,547
First 90 days on the outside, Miss James,

1090
01:01:56,547 --> 01:01:58,609
that's when they make it or break it.

1091
01:01:58,609 --> 01:02:01,275
- Well, why don't you just let Clay go?

1092
01:02:01,275 --> 01:02:05,347
- I can keep him from going
back to prison this time.

1093
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:07,835
But someone's got to bail him out.

1094
01:02:07,835 --> 01:02:08,668
- Why me?

1095
01:02:09,536 --> 01:02:11,203
- Who else is there?

1096
01:02:12,622 --> 01:02:14,198
- I'm afraid of him.

1097
01:02:14,198 --> 01:02:16,049
- I don't think so.

1098
01:02:16,049 --> 01:02:18,882
I think you're afraid of yourself.

1099
01:02:20,988 --> 01:02:22,905
Are you gonna bail him?

1100
01:02:24,238 --> 01:02:26,110
- I don't know.

1101
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:29,110
- If you do, you're in for the ride.

1102
01:02:37,411 --> 01:02:38,244
- Hey, Jared!

1103
01:02:38,244 --> 01:02:39,077
You're late.

1104
01:02:39,077 --> 01:02:39,910
You're not dressed.

1105
01:02:39,910 --> 01:02:41,785
- I'm dressed.

1106
01:02:41,785 --> 01:02:43,275
Now, I may not be no competition for your

1107
01:02:43,275 --> 01:02:47,150
blue collar follies, but I'm dressed.

1108
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:49,435
- I got half a mind to have
you thrown off the job.

1109
01:02:49,435 --> 01:02:50,460
- Half a mind?

1110
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:52,929
You give yourself a whole lot
of credit there, don't you?

1111
01:02:52,929 --> 01:02:53,908
- You're fired!

1112
01:02:53,908 --> 01:02:55,574
I don't know why I ever hired you.

1113
01:02:55,574 --> 01:02:58,623
- 'Cause I work like
a dog for minimum pay.

1114
01:02:58,623 --> 01:03:02,399
Yo, just give me my
pay and I'm outta here.

1115
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:03,333
- You want your pay?

1116
01:03:03,333 --> 01:03:05,089
You can pick it up in two weeks.

1117
01:03:05,089 --> 01:03:06,473
Of course, we're gonna have to check

1118
01:03:06,473 --> 01:03:08,646
to see if you made enough
withholding for the year.

1119
01:03:08,646 --> 01:03:09,825
And those girls in the office,

1120
01:03:09,825 --> 01:03:12,369
they never seem to get that just right.

1121
01:03:12,369 --> 01:03:14,449
(dramatic music)

1122
01:03:14,449 --> 01:03:17,592
- I think they're gonna
get it exactly right.

1123
01:03:17,592 --> 01:03:20,686
'Cause, see, you're what they
call a responsible person.

1124
01:03:20,686 --> 01:03:24,519
Matter of fact, you're
the responsible person.

1125
01:03:25,894 --> 01:03:28,311
Now, if I got any grievances,

1126
01:03:30,186 --> 01:03:31,686
I'm comin' to you.

1127
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:34,343
Capisce?

1128
01:03:49,404 --> 01:03:53,124
- I still don't understand
why you bailed me out.

1129
01:03:53,124 --> 01:03:55,422
I thought you cut me loose.

1130
01:03:55,422 --> 01:03:57,141
- I don't know why I did, either.

1131
01:03:57,141 --> 01:04:00,974
And I'm scared to death
to tell you the truth.

1132
01:04:21,857 --> 01:04:24,203
- Everything's just like I left it.

1133
01:04:24,203 --> 01:04:25,350
- Well, you didn't expect him

1134
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:27,844
to do the house cleaning, did you?

1135
01:04:27,844 --> 01:04:31,966
- I just hope he gets
here before 10 o'clock.

1136
01:04:31,966 --> 01:04:33,966
- Got anything to drink?

1137
01:04:39,362 --> 01:04:40,962
- Was that a joke?

1138
01:04:40,962 --> 01:04:42,417
- I thought so.

1139
01:04:42,417 --> 01:04:45,917
Only I won't be convinced until you laugh.

1140
01:05:23,929 --> 01:05:26,444
Two drinks and I'm a pushover.

1141
01:05:26,444 --> 01:05:27,277
Cheers!

1142
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:31,127
(soft music)

1143
01:05:33,406 --> 01:05:35,931
- I don't know how to act when

1144
01:05:35,931 --> 01:05:37,931
someone's so nice to me.

1145
01:06:56,907 --> 01:06:58,074
I want it all.

1146
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:02,008
- You can have it all.

1147
01:07:02,008 --> 01:07:03,880
Just gotta take it.

1148
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,070
And hold on for dear life.

1149
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:08,987
(soft jazzy music)

1150
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:14,657
- [Tyrrell] I say we
get some Cadillacs, man.

1151
01:07:14,657 --> 01:07:15,527
- No, man.

1152
01:07:15,527 --> 01:07:17,528
Big Ed pays more for yuppie cars.

1153
01:07:17,528 --> 01:07:18,539
Jar, you say your old man

1154
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:21,087
works at a Mercedes dealership?

1155
01:07:21,087 --> 01:07:22,048
- Yeah, yeah.

1156
01:07:22,048 --> 01:07:23,609
But that ain't the place
to hit, though, man.

1157
01:07:23,609 --> 01:07:24,803
'Cause where he works at

1158
01:07:24,803 --> 01:07:26,432
they got alarms direct wired to the cars.

1159
01:07:26,432 --> 01:07:27,493
You know what I'm sayin'?

1160
01:07:27,493 --> 01:07:29,616
By the time we got all
our problems worked out,

1161
01:07:29,616 --> 01:07:31,352
the cops will be on us.

1162
01:07:31,352 --> 01:07:32,769
- That's what makes it a challenge.

1163
01:07:32,769 --> 01:07:35,774
Don't you want a challenge, Jar?

1164
01:07:35,774 --> 01:07:37,143
- Yo, yo, move in.

1165
01:07:37,143 --> 01:07:39,531
Take a few parking lots
in, that's what's up.

1166
01:07:39,531 --> 01:07:41,808
- No, no, then you got
license plates to deal with,

1167
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:43,646
possibly inferior product.

1168
01:07:43,646 --> 01:07:45,238
Ed don't pay much for used cars.

1169
01:07:45,238 --> 01:07:46,235
You know that, Jared.

1170
01:07:46,235 --> 01:07:47,596
- Di, you can't steal no showroom cars.

1171
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:49,161
They don't put no gas in it.

1172
01:07:49,161 --> 01:07:51,043
And it ain't about hotwiring,
because you can't do that.

1173
01:07:51,043 --> 01:07:51,876
- Wait.

1174
01:07:51,876 --> 01:07:53,674
Big Ed is a professional.

1175
01:07:53,674 --> 01:07:56,334
He don't send us out
without the inside story.

1176
01:07:56,334 --> 01:07:57,167
- Yeah, man.

1177
01:07:57,167 --> 01:07:58,131
He knows where the keys are

1178
01:07:58,131 --> 01:07:59,240
and how to get them.

1179
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,547
- How he gonna know all that?

1180
01:08:00,547 --> 01:08:02,942
- 'Cause he has cased
every dealership in town.

1181
01:08:02,942 --> 01:08:04,706
- Look, all we got to do is get the cars

1182
01:08:04,706 --> 01:08:07,392
inside the warehouse and we're home free.

1183
01:08:07,392 --> 01:08:08,867
- Yo!

1184
01:08:08,867 --> 01:08:11,034
Why it got to be that one?

1185
01:08:11,898 --> 01:08:13,148
- You know why!

1186
01:08:14,299 --> 01:08:16,382
Time, it's time, brother.

1187
01:08:17,257 --> 01:08:19,819
You gotta chose between him and us.

1188
01:08:19,819 --> 01:08:23,236
You gotta decide who your real family is.

1189
01:08:27,349 --> 01:08:28,682
- You in or out?

1190
01:08:31,304 --> 01:08:33,175
- Yo, man, what that sucker
ever do for you, man?

1191
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:35,729
That's what I want to know.

1192
01:08:35,729 --> 01:08:36,777
- Yo!

1193
01:08:36,777 --> 01:08:38,120
My old man never did me no favors.

1194
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:38,999
I'm down.

1195
01:08:38,999 --> 01:08:41,082
- That's what I'm sayin'!

1196
01:08:43,044 --> 01:08:43,877
- I'm with you.

1197
01:08:43,877 --> 01:08:44,710
(soft music)

1198
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:46,877
- Why don't you sleep now?

1199
01:08:49,846 --> 01:08:51,179
- I can't sleep.

1200
01:08:52,213 --> 01:08:55,022
Every time I close my eyes,

1201
01:08:55,022 --> 01:08:58,300
I'm dreamin' I'm in that prison.

1202
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:02,050
It's like I get locked
up every time I sleep.

1203
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:05,968
I'd much rather keep them open on you.

1204
01:09:05,968 --> 01:09:08,885
(soft jazzy music)

1205
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:13,480
(phone ringing)

1206
01:09:29,412 --> 01:09:30,245
Hello?

1207
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:32,712
He's gone out.

1208
01:09:32,712 --> 01:09:34,060
- Do you expect him shortly?

1209
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:35,375
- Yeah, any second.

1210
01:09:35,375 --> 01:09:37,930
He's right, any second.

1211
01:09:37,930 --> 01:09:40,879
- He didn't show up for his UA yesterday.

1212
01:09:40,879 --> 01:09:42,441
I checked in at the meat-packing plant.

1213
01:09:42,441 --> 01:09:45,024
Seems he no longer works there.

1214
01:09:46,172 --> 01:09:48,857
Employment is not one of
the terms of his probation.

1215
01:09:48,857 --> 01:09:50,879
Two road signs pointing the same direction

1216
01:09:50,879 --> 01:09:53,292
usually means you're going someplace.

1217
01:09:53,292 --> 01:09:58,125
If he's not there by midnight,
I'm pulling the plug, Clay.

1218
01:10:00,166 --> 01:10:02,262
- What's the matter?

1219
01:10:02,262 --> 01:10:03,845
- I gotta find him.

1220
01:10:26,241 --> 01:10:27,881
- [Yvonne] What is it?

1221
01:10:27,881 --> 01:10:30,879
- He got this in the old neighborhood.

1222
01:10:30,879 --> 01:10:33,629
Just couldn't stay away, damn it!

1223
01:10:34,857 --> 01:10:36,690
- Where are you going?

1224
01:10:38,535 --> 01:10:40,417
- I've done mostly
everything wrong in my life.

1225
01:10:40,417 --> 01:10:42,257
I have no excuses.

1226
01:10:42,257 --> 01:10:45,174
If I can't save him now, he's lost.

1227
01:10:48,116 --> 01:10:51,423
What did I ever do to
deserve you in my life?

1228
01:10:51,423 --> 01:10:54,340
(soft jazzy music)

1229
01:11:02,943 --> 01:11:04,026
- Be careful.

1230
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:16,050
(dramatic music)

1231
01:11:33,737 --> 01:11:34,570
- Cops!

1232
01:11:35,410 --> 01:11:36,493
Just be cool.

1233
01:11:38,497 --> 01:11:40,061
Ain't no black-and-white gonna cruise

1234
01:11:40,061 --> 01:11:42,170
this way for the rest of the night.

1235
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:44,972
They just want time to get
outta the neighborhood.

1236
01:11:44,972 --> 01:11:46,564
Just give 'em time.

1237
01:11:46,564 --> 01:11:47,897
- This gonna be good.

1238
01:11:47,897 --> 01:11:48,968
We're gonna be rich.

1239
01:11:48,968 --> 01:11:50,114
- Man, you ain't gonna be nothin'

1240
01:11:50,114 --> 01:11:52,094
if your woman find out you worked tonight.

1241
01:11:52,094 --> 01:11:53,730
They're gonna take it
all for your kiddies.

1242
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:54,563
- Hell, no!

1243
01:11:54,563 --> 01:11:55,612
She ain't gonna find out about it.

1244
01:11:55,612 --> 01:11:57,900
I ain't gonna support
four crumb-snatchers.

1245
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,270
- You have four kids now?

1246
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:00,802
- Serious.
- Damn!

1247
01:12:00,802 --> 01:12:02,623
You've been busy, brother!

1248
01:12:02,623 --> 01:12:03,456
- Yes.

1249
01:12:03,456 --> 01:12:05,522
- That'll give you time
to catch up now, Jar.

1250
01:12:05,522 --> 01:12:07,434
- He'd have to have two sets
of twins to catch up with me.

1251
01:12:07,434 --> 01:12:09,314
I got me another one on the way.

1252
01:12:09,314 --> 01:12:10,147
- Damn!

1253
01:12:10,147 --> 01:12:10,980
- Now, hold on, hold on.

1254
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:12,785
Two sets of twins would
make it four, right?

1255
01:12:12,785 --> 01:12:15,314
- Yeah, well, countin' the
notch already on your stick,

1256
01:12:15,314 --> 01:12:16,929
that makes five.

1257
01:12:16,929 --> 01:12:19,512
(all laughing)

1258
01:12:21,517 --> 01:12:22,361
- Oh, come on, man!

1259
01:12:22,361 --> 01:12:24,288
Don't look so serious, ain't nothin'

1260
01:12:24,288 --> 01:12:26,172
to being a daddy.
- Yeah, you sure

1261
01:12:26,172 --> 01:12:28,172
got a sweet little girl.

1262
01:12:29,377 --> 01:12:31,917
- That, that little girl,
you're telling me that,

1263
01:12:31,917 --> 01:12:33,734
that's mine?

1264
01:12:33,734 --> 01:12:35,392
That's me?

1265
01:12:35,392 --> 01:12:37,408
- Sharon never told you, huh?

1266
01:12:37,408 --> 01:12:39,529
Now, ain't that just like a woman?

1267
01:12:39,529 --> 01:12:42,272
(all laughing)

1268
01:12:42,272 --> 01:12:45,022
(dramatic music)

1269
01:13:02,846 --> 01:13:03,763
- Let's go.

1270
01:13:05,488 --> 01:13:08,488
(suspenseful music)

1271
01:13:23,902 --> 01:13:25,902
- [Man] I got your back.

1272
01:13:27,748 --> 01:13:29,437
- Do it, do it, do it!

1273
01:13:29,437 --> 01:13:30,854
- Come on, do it!

1274
01:13:31,728 --> 01:13:36,561
(yells)
(glass shatters)

1275
01:13:37,426 --> 01:13:38,646
(alarm ringing)

1276
01:13:38,646 --> 01:13:41,563
(tires screeching)

1277
01:13:44,284 --> 01:13:45,856
- [Man] What the hell you doin', man?

1278
01:13:45,856 --> 01:13:48,773
(glass shattering)

1279
01:13:57,241 --> 01:13:58,908
- I've got the keys!

1280
01:14:02,088 --> 01:14:02,921
Break her!

1281
01:14:03,843 --> 01:14:06,593
(glass shatters)

1282
01:14:07,607 --> 01:14:08,440
Get in, man!

1283
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:09,273
Get in!

1284
01:14:14,956 --> 01:14:15,789
Hurry up.

1285
01:14:15,789 --> 01:14:16,983
Come on.

1286
01:14:16,983 --> 01:14:17,816
The keys!

1287
01:14:25,542 --> 01:14:26,375
- Jared!

1288
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:34,701
What the hell you doin', man?

1289
01:14:34,701 --> 01:14:36,201
Move it!

1290
01:14:36,201 --> 01:14:37,701
- I ain't with it.

1291
01:14:42,385 --> 01:14:43,718
I want out, man.

1292
01:14:44,935 --> 01:14:46,521
- You don't get in that car and drive,

1293
01:14:46,521 --> 01:14:49,490
I'll mix your brains with broken glass.

1294
01:14:49,490 --> 01:14:53,573
Now you follow Dion and
I'll be right behind you.

1295
01:15:05,684 --> 01:15:08,934
(car tires screeching)

1296
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:25,913
(police sirens blaring)

1297
01:16:49,159 --> 01:16:50,599
- Hey, what's up with you, man?

1298
01:16:50,599 --> 01:16:51,485
- What's up with you, man?

1299
01:16:51,485 --> 01:16:52,772
- You crapped out on us, man!

1300
01:16:52,772 --> 01:16:54,009
Could've got us all killed.

1301
01:16:54,009 --> 01:16:55,331
- I did what I was supposed to do.

1302
01:16:55,331 --> 01:16:57,007
- Just shut up.

1303
01:16:57,007 --> 01:16:58,638
- What's the problem?

1304
01:16:58,638 --> 01:17:00,607
- My man Jared went chicken on us.

1305
01:17:00,607 --> 01:17:02,306
He was standing around peeing his pants

1306
01:17:02,306 --> 01:17:04,767
instead of carrying out the instructions.

1307
01:17:04,767 --> 01:17:06,201
Man, look what he did to our car.

1308
01:17:06,201 --> 01:17:07,034
- That was an accident!

1309
01:17:07,034 --> 01:17:09,011
I didn't ask to drive that car, anyway!

1310
01:17:09,011 --> 01:17:10,231
- Shut up.

1311
01:17:10,231 --> 01:17:12,521
I'll have to deduct
five K for that fender.

1312
01:17:12,521 --> 01:17:13,963
that comes out of your take.

1313
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:15,257
- Well, you can keep that.

1314
01:17:15,257 --> 01:17:17,685
I don't want no part of that.

1315
01:17:17,685 --> 01:17:19,823
- I don't want to see his ugly face again.

1316
01:17:19,823 --> 01:17:21,460
I don't want losers screwing up a business

1317
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:23,657
that took 20 years to build.

1318
01:17:23,657 --> 01:17:27,490
Now, you pay your men
and get 'em out of here!

1319
01:17:34,783 --> 01:17:36,450
- Tyrrell, count it.

1320
01:17:37,327 --> 01:17:39,490
Dion, here's yours.

1321
01:17:39,490 --> 01:17:40,323
You drive.

1322
01:17:45,795 --> 01:17:46,921
(siren wailing)

1323
01:17:46,921 --> 01:17:47,754
Jared.

1324
01:17:47,754 --> 01:17:48,587
- I told you.

1325
01:17:48,587 --> 01:17:50,030
I don't want none of it.

1326
01:17:50,030 --> 01:17:51,239
- Hey, you gotta take it, man.

1327
01:17:51,239 --> 01:17:52,497
You earned it.

1328
01:17:52,497 --> 01:17:53,521
- No, you keep that.

1329
01:17:53,521 --> 01:17:55,910
I want to buy my way out.

1330
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:57,969
- You don't buy your way out.

1331
01:17:57,969 --> 01:17:59,887
You get invited out.

1332
01:17:59,887 --> 01:18:01,449
Now, you don't show no
respect for your family.

1333
01:18:01,449 --> 01:18:04,199
You don't deserve to be among us.

1334
01:18:06,409 --> 01:18:09,007
You stay outta my face,

1335
01:18:09,007 --> 01:18:10,424
or pay the price.

1336
01:18:15,972 --> 01:18:20,972
(engine revving)
(upbeat music)

1337
01:18:37,030 --> 01:18:37,863
- Hey!

1338
01:18:40,492 --> 01:18:42,169
Get on here.

1339
01:18:42,169 --> 01:18:43,002
- No.

1340
01:18:43,002 --> 01:18:43,835
- Hey!

1341
01:18:50,692 --> 01:18:51,530
- What?

1342
01:18:51,530 --> 01:18:53,780
(grunting)

1343
01:18:55,057 --> 01:18:57,724
(both grunting)

1344
01:19:02,165 --> 01:19:03,296
(dramatic music)

1345
01:19:03,296 --> 01:19:05,231
- We gotta talk, boy.

1346
01:19:05,231 --> 01:19:06,814
For real this time.

1347
01:19:23,346 --> 01:19:24,955
- You've got no right to be here, man.

1348
01:19:24,955 --> 01:19:25,973
- I loved her and I married her.

1349
01:19:25,973 --> 01:19:27,067
That gives me the right.

1350
01:19:27,067 --> 01:19:28,064
- You killed her.

1351
01:19:28,064 --> 01:19:29,647
You lost the right.

1352
01:19:30,543 --> 01:19:32,409
- You really know how to
hurt me with those words,

1353
01:19:32,409 --> 01:19:33,242
don't you?

1354
01:19:33,242 --> 01:19:36,325
- Man, I could never hurt you enough.

1355
01:19:48,428 --> 01:19:50,364
- Your mama's what binds us.

1356
01:19:50,364 --> 01:19:51,697
We need her now.

1357
01:19:55,412 --> 01:19:57,345
She was a beautiful woman.

1358
01:19:57,345 --> 01:20:00,065
So young, so full of hope.

1359
01:20:00,065 --> 01:20:01,232
- She was old.

1360
01:20:02,281 --> 01:20:04,447
She had gray hair before her time.

1361
01:20:04,447 --> 01:20:07,388
The hope was all gone out of her.

1362
01:20:07,388 --> 01:20:08,221
For years.

1363
01:20:10,929 --> 01:20:13,012
You broke her heart, man.

1364
01:20:14,108 --> 01:20:15,775
She dried up inside,

1365
01:20:17,251 --> 01:20:18,751
and then she died.

1366
01:20:20,939 --> 01:20:22,705
- I loved your mama, Jared.

1367
01:20:22,705 --> 01:20:23,583
You gotta believe that,

1368
01:20:23,583 --> 01:20:24,416
- You divorced her.

1369
01:20:24,416 --> 01:20:26,399
She would have waited
forever for you to get out.

1370
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:28,304
You wouldn't even let her come visit you.

1371
01:20:28,304 --> 01:20:30,344
- I didn't want her
hanging out with no loser.

1372
01:20:30,344 --> 01:20:31,360
I wanted to set her free.

1373
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:33,632
I was no good for her, Jared.

1374
01:20:33,632 --> 01:20:34,941
Everybody knew that.

1375
01:20:34,941 --> 01:20:39,139
- But she never stopped waiting
for you to come back, man.

1376
01:20:39,139 --> 01:20:40,576
And she never,

1377
01:20:40,576 --> 01:20:44,054
never let anyone else touch her.

1378
01:20:44,054 --> 01:20:47,209
- She knew where I was, why I was there.

1379
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:48,896
I wanted her to forget me.

1380
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:49,729
- Don't you get it, man?

1381
01:20:49,729 --> 01:20:51,729
She couldn't forget you.

1382
01:20:52,565 --> 01:20:56,736
When someone gives you
their love and you leave,

1383
01:20:56,736 --> 01:20:57,569
it's gone.

1384
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:02,140
What you did, you took her love man,

1385
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:05,473
you're just a thief through and through.

1386
01:21:07,553 --> 01:21:09,305
- Jared, you don't know
what it's like when a man

1387
01:21:09,305 --> 01:21:12,363
can't take care of his family.

1388
01:21:12,363 --> 01:21:14,638
I couldn't stand that.

1389
01:21:14,638 --> 01:21:16,155
Stealing cars was the only way

1390
01:21:16,155 --> 01:21:17,845
I could make some decent money.

1391
01:21:17,845 --> 01:21:18,855
- You could've been a janitor.

1392
01:21:18,855 --> 01:21:19,688
- A janitor?

1393
01:21:19,688 --> 01:21:22,033
- Other people's fathers
take jobs they hate, man.

1394
01:21:22,033 --> 01:21:24,866
But you was too good for all that.

1395
01:21:26,798 --> 01:21:29,299
She had your picture out, man.

1396
01:21:29,299 --> 01:21:33,132
I had to look at it every
damn day of my life.

1397
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:36,043
I couldn't say nothin' bad about you.

1398
01:21:36,043 --> 01:21:39,238
I'd to hear about the way you
was before things went bad.

1399
01:21:39,238 --> 01:21:41,276
But, see, I knew what was up with you.

1400
01:21:41,276 --> 01:21:43,362
I knew you were sittin'
in some hole somewhere

1401
01:21:43,362 --> 01:21:44,638
thinkin' you got off easy!

1402
01:21:44,638 --> 01:21:46,416
Thinking you didn't have
to take no responsibility

1403
01:21:46,416 --> 01:21:47,499
for your son.

1404
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,523
You just left her to do it all alone.

1405
01:21:58,739 --> 01:22:02,239
But, see man, you didn't just divorce her.

1406
01:22:03,438 --> 01:22:04,771
You divorced me.

1407
01:22:06,595 --> 01:22:09,012
And I hate you for that, man.

1408
01:22:09,928 --> 01:22:10,845
I hate you.

1409
01:22:32,602 --> 01:22:33,435
- 1988.

1410
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:38,778
Is that when you first
started getting' angry, Jared?

1411
01:22:38,778 --> 01:22:40,763
First started acting like me?

1412
01:22:40,763 --> 01:22:41,830
- I ain't like you.

1413
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:44,740
- Yes, you are.
- I ain't nothin' like you!

1414
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:45,990
- Yes, you are.

1415
01:22:46,895 --> 01:22:50,956
You are startin' to make
the same mistakes I made.

1416
01:22:50,956 --> 01:22:53,641
My daddy made my mama cry.

1417
01:22:53,641 --> 01:22:55,391
I made your mama cry.

1418
01:22:58,737 --> 01:23:01,982
Who you gonna make cry, Jared?

1419
01:23:01,982 --> 01:23:02,815
Huh?

1420
01:23:09,143 --> 01:23:10,476
- I already did.

1421
01:23:11,378 --> 01:23:12,211
- What?

1422
01:23:15,481 --> 01:23:17,731
- I got a little girl, man.

1423
01:23:18,796 --> 01:23:21,379
About two and a half years old.

1424
01:23:24,302 --> 01:23:25,135
- Man.

1425
01:23:30,318 --> 01:23:31,318
Hey, can we,

1426
01:23:33,657 --> 01:23:35,657
can we break this cycle?

1427
01:23:37,631 --> 01:23:40,131
You got to be with her, Jared.

1428
01:23:44,295 --> 01:23:47,045
(dramatic music)

1429
01:23:50,010 --> 01:23:53,580
I wish I could make it up to you, son,

1430
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:55,580
not being there for you.

1431
01:23:56,884 --> 01:23:58,801
- I wish you could too.

1432
01:24:01,278 --> 01:24:02,445
But you can't.

1433
01:24:03,425 --> 01:24:06,175
(dramatic music)

1434
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:34,173
- You should have made
him take the money, man.

1435
01:24:34,173 --> 01:24:35,585
You didn't see him at the job, man.

1436
01:24:35,585 --> 01:24:38,259
Like, like he was standing
there watching us, taking notes.

1437
01:24:38,259 --> 01:24:39,379
Now he don't got the money.

1438
01:24:39,379 --> 01:24:41,122
Maybe he can tell the cops we forced him.

1439
01:24:41,122 --> 01:24:42,563
- Get out of my face.

1440
01:24:42,563 --> 01:24:43,699
He's on probation.

1441
01:24:43,699 --> 01:24:45,004
You think he's going to run to the cops

1442
01:24:45,004 --> 01:24:46,401
with some dumbass story?

1443
01:24:46,401 --> 01:24:47,659
They'd put him away in two seconds,

1444
01:24:47,659 --> 01:24:49,106
ain't no questions asked.

1445
01:24:49,106 --> 01:24:51,043
- Yeah, but, he changed, man.

1446
01:24:51,043 --> 01:24:53,104
You didn't see him.

1447
01:24:53,104 --> 01:24:55,345
I think he smashed that
car on purpose, man.

1448
01:24:55,345 --> 01:24:56,684
Tryin' to stick it to us.

1449
01:24:56,684 --> 01:24:57,681
- That's right, Mario.

1450
01:24:57,681 --> 01:24:58,763
You didn't see him.

1451
01:24:58,763 --> 01:25:00,698
You should've been there.

1452
01:25:00,698 --> 01:25:03,081
Our man Jared is not one of us anymore.

1453
01:25:03,081 --> 01:25:05,498
And he smashed a $85,000 car.

1454
01:25:06,566 --> 01:25:08,244
- I tell you what.

1455
01:25:08,244 --> 01:25:10,945
I don't trust nobody
don't take that money.

1456
01:25:10,945 --> 01:25:12,445
- [Man] Me either.

1457
01:25:15,425 --> 01:25:16,258
- Come on.

1458
01:25:18,357 --> 01:25:21,867
We got some unfinished
business to tend to.

1459
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:23,117
- That's right!

1460
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:29,466
(phone ringing)

1461
01:25:29,466 --> 01:25:30,975
- Hello?

1462
01:25:30,975 --> 01:25:32,985
- Parole Agent Torres, Miss James.

1463
01:25:32,985 --> 01:25:34,689
I heard about the break in.

1464
01:25:34,689 --> 01:25:38,619
I also know neither Clay or
his son were home by midnight.

1465
01:25:38,619 --> 01:25:39,617
- [Yvonne] Well, I can tell you Clay

1466
01:25:39,617 --> 01:25:41,925
had nothing to do with the break-in.

1467
01:25:41,925 --> 01:25:43,130
- How do you know that?

1468
01:25:43,130 --> 01:25:45,339
- Because I was with him last night.

1469
01:25:45,339 --> 01:25:47,256
He, he's really trying.

1470
01:25:48,502 --> 01:25:51,662
He went out to look for
Jared after he spoke to you.

1471
01:25:51,662 --> 01:25:53,351
He didn't steal these cars.

1472
01:25:53,351 --> 01:25:55,920
That would've been the
furthest thing from his mind.

1473
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,648
- And where did he go to look for Jared?

1474
01:25:57,648 --> 01:25:58,793
- I don't know.

1475
01:25:58,793 --> 01:26:00,265
Jared could be anywhere.

1476
01:26:00,265 --> 01:26:01,452
This is a big city.

1477
01:26:01,452 --> 01:26:02,952
- Oh, no ma'am.

1478
01:26:02,952 --> 01:26:04,237
It's small for people who only have

1479
01:26:04,237 --> 01:26:06,632
one little corner of it to call home.

1480
01:26:06,632 --> 01:26:08,624
- All right, then why
are we playing this game?

1481
01:26:08,624 --> 01:26:11,013
You know where he went
and you know he had to go.

1482
01:26:11,013 --> 01:26:13,096
Why didn't you go look for Jared?

1483
01:26:13,096 --> 01:26:16,652
You were just setting Clay up to fail.

1484
01:26:16,652 --> 01:26:18,254
- No, I wasn't.

1485
01:26:18,254 --> 01:26:20,315
You'll have to believe that.

1486
01:26:20,315 --> 01:26:21,995
Their home turf is off limits.

1487
01:26:21,995 --> 01:26:25,091
I'd have to bust Jared
if I found him there.

1488
01:26:25,091 --> 01:26:28,392
I was hoping Clay would bring
him out without incident.

1489
01:26:28,392 --> 01:26:31,809
- Can you find them before the police do?

1490
01:26:32,813 --> 01:26:33,873
- I'll try.

1491
01:26:33,873 --> 01:26:35,776
- I'm gonna wait for
Clay at his apartment,

1492
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:37,274
if you need me.

1493
01:26:37,274 --> 01:26:38,107
- Thanks.

1494
01:26:49,235 --> 01:26:50,819
- You sure this is the place?

1495
01:26:50,819 --> 01:26:52,138
- You saw his name on the mailbox!

1496
01:26:52,138 --> 01:26:54,336
- Yeah, man, but I never got
my mail any place I ever lived.

1497
01:26:54,336 --> 01:26:55,326
- Yeah, but you ain't on probation.

1498
01:26:55,326 --> 01:26:56,389
- So, what you sayin'?

1499
01:26:56,389 --> 01:26:57,222
- You know what I'm sayin'-

1500
01:26:57,222 --> 01:26:58,472
- Just shut up!

1501
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:01,712
- Man, where is he, then?

1502
01:27:01,712 --> 01:27:04,079
That's all I'm sayin'.

1503
01:27:04,079 --> 01:27:04,912
- Don't matter.

1504
01:27:04,912 --> 01:27:07,698
At some point, he's coming home.

1505
01:27:07,698 --> 01:27:09,159
- Man, if that sucker
thinks he can screw us over

1506
01:27:09,159 --> 01:27:12,349
'cause he did hard time, man, he's crazy.

1507
01:27:12,349 --> 01:27:14,247
- Hey, I thought we was
just gonna to talk to him.

1508
01:27:14,247 --> 01:27:16,429
Make him take the money,

1509
01:27:16,429 --> 01:27:18,544
- Hey, man, we're just gonna talk, man.

1510
01:27:18,544 --> 01:27:20,377
We're just gonna talk.

1511
01:27:23,231 --> 01:27:24,064
Hey, look.

1512
01:27:37,447 --> 01:27:40,447
(suspenseful music)

1513
01:28:01,970 --> 01:28:04,970
(suspenseful music)

1514
01:28:07,503 --> 01:28:09,086
- Come on, come on.

1515
01:28:13,151 --> 01:28:15,734
(men grunting)

1516
01:28:37,286 --> 01:28:40,286
We don't want you talking to nobody.

1517
01:28:41,287 --> 01:28:42,388
- Jared!

1518
01:28:42,388 --> 01:28:44,805
(gun firing)

1519
01:28:50,129 --> 01:28:51,712
- Come on, come on.

1520
01:28:54,453 --> 01:28:56,286
Get on your feet, man!

1521
01:29:02,096 --> 01:29:04,346
Somebody call an ambulance!

1522
01:29:05,317 --> 01:29:06,567
- [Man] Go, go!

1523
01:29:15,875 --> 01:29:16,708
- Clay!

1524
01:29:18,894 --> 01:29:20,727
- Don't you die on me!

1525
01:29:22,294 --> 01:29:24,211
- Clay, oh, my God, oh.

1526
01:29:26,124 --> 01:29:27,541
Somebody help us!

1527
01:29:41,487 --> 01:29:42,533
- Come on, come on.

1528
01:29:42,533 --> 01:29:43,783
It's all right.

1529
01:29:51,787 --> 01:29:52,870
- I love you.

1530
01:29:55,531 --> 01:29:56,614
I always did.

1531
01:30:01,771 --> 01:30:02,604
- Daddy.

1532
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:06,001
Come on, stay with me, man.

1533
01:30:06,001 --> 01:30:07,964
Come on, don't leave me.

1534
01:30:07,964 --> 01:30:09,631
Don't leave me, man,

1535
01:30:10,916 --> 01:30:12,510
Come on, come on.

1536
01:30:12,510 --> 01:30:13,343
Hold on.

1537
01:30:15,046 --> 01:30:15,926
Hold on, man.

1538
01:30:15,926 --> 01:30:19,463
(ambulance siren wailing)

1539
01:30:19,463 --> 01:30:20,296
No!

1540
01:30:22,025 --> 01:30:23,284
No!

1541
01:30:23,284 --> 01:30:26,784
(ambulance siren wailing)

1542
01:30:38,189 --> 01:30:41,384
So, all this time you're
spending with me, man,

1543
01:30:41,384 --> 01:30:43,294
you spend that much time
with all your clients?

1544
01:30:43,294 --> 01:30:45,780
- Hey, I spend more time
chasing some of them.

1545
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:47,140
Did I ever tell you about the guy

1546
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:49,059
who lives in a trailer
with 50 rattlesnakes?

1547
01:30:49,059 --> 01:30:49,892
- No, don't.

1548
01:30:49,892 --> 01:30:51,254
(laughing)

1549
01:30:51,254 --> 01:30:53,132
- Just goes to show we can all get along

1550
01:30:53,132 --> 01:30:54,882
with different types.

1551
01:30:58,384 --> 01:31:00,634
Here, give her this for me.

1552
01:31:01,579 --> 01:31:04,141
(toy dog barking)

1553
01:31:04,141 --> 01:31:06,858
- Yo, we gotta stop
shopping at the same store.

1554
01:31:06,858 --> 01:31:09,136
(toy dog barking)
(laughs)

1555
01:31:09,136 --> 01:31:10,166
- Give her both.

1556
01:31:10,166 --> 01:31:13,416
She'll figure out what to do with them.

1557
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:16,913
- Thanks.

1558
01:31:33,014 --> 01:31:35,431
(soft music)

1559
01:31:41,957 --> 01:31:42,790
- Daddy!

1560
01:31:48,587 --> 01:31:50,837
(laughing)

1561
01:31:55,161 --> 01:31:57,825
- I got a flower for you.

1562
01:31:57,825 --> 01:31:58,658
And I got-

1563
01:31:58,658 --> 01:32:01,575
(soft jazzy music)

1564
01:32:09,067 --> 01:32:11,817
(dramatic music)

1565
01:32:44,395 --> 01:32:46,812
(soft music)

1566
01:32:52,387 --> 01:32:54,804
(soft music)
