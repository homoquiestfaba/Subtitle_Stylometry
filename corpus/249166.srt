1
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:14,925
Bearing three-niner-five.
Approaching target, over.

2
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,569
Confirm vector for ground elevation.

3
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,465
We are go for housekeeping.

4
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,970
Raptor standing by
on your coordinates.

5
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,369
Roger, understood.

6
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,373
Al I rig ht, this is it.
Secure those rafts.

7
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,603
Let's go, go, go!

8
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:32,111
It was another day.
Another mission.

9
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,913
Marines were flushing the rebels off
the beach and up to the mountains...

10
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:39,023
... where my team
was going to catch them.

11
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:42,592
A classic tac-ops mission.

12
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,197
Flying fast and low.

13
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:55,863
Five hundred feet over a valley
we blasted the night before.

14
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,933
My team...

15
00:02:58,144 --> 00:02:59,873
... was ready.

16
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,289
Cooper, take out that gunner!

17
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,624
Go, go, go!

18
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,404
We got two cover teams in position.

19
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,941
Possibility of bunkers.

20
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:39,305
Need ATPD on grid,
7. 1 degrees north.

21
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,680
Get down!

22
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,178
Move out!

23
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,930
Move, move, move!

24
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,134
What I can tell you is,
as of 0650 today...

25
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,142
...our joint forces engaged rebels...

26
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,372
...known to be harboring
foreign fighters...

27
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,516
...from the AKD.

28
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,481
Are you specifically targeting...

29
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:24,623
...Abubakar Al Hassan,
who fought in Afghanistan?

30
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:33,057
This is a serious game,
and we are pursuing AKD leaders.

31
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:36,167
And we'll catch them,
that's all there is to it.

32
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,304
While our forces will be
driving the rebels west...

33
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,496
...General Bondoc's army...

34
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:45,337
...will be pushing
the AKD brigade into the valley.

35
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,672
As Captain Escalona
is fond of saying...

36
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:52,045
...we know more about where the
rebels are than they do themselves.

37
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:55,687
I see how all this helps
with their rebel problem here...

38
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:58,618
...but how are we doing
in the war against the AKD?

39
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,156
Certain factions of the rebels...

40
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,352
-...are AKD.
-Right, but...

41
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,656
...the Mindanao rebels have fought
the government...

42
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,560
...for more than 30 years.

43
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:10,759
Now suddenly,
you've decided they're AKD?

44
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,063
-Why?
-We believe that their...

45
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:16,070
...withdrawal from
the peace negotiations...

46
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,641
...and the recent surge
in bombings and kidnappings...

47
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,075
...are directly related to AKD.

48
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,714
The Philippine government
is certain of this.

49
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,713
Absolutely.

50
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,515
Scout Two for Flight Control. Over.

51
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,919
Go ahead, Scout Two.

52
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,220
Control, we have visual
confirming fire teams...

53
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,953
...have cleared the beach. Over.

54
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,689
Copy Scout Two.
And the rebels? Over.

55
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,358
Still searching for the camp.
We'll report on contact. Over.

56
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,539
Roger that. Control out.

57
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,305
Flight Control to Eagle One. Over.

58
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,984
This is Eagle One.
Go ahead, Control.

59
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:36,155
Advance scouts report
no rebel contact in the inland valley.

60
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:39,483
Looks like a clean ride for you
up to the drop point. Over.

61
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,523
That's good to hear, Control.

62
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:44,218
Any word on Abubakar? Over.

63
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,797
Early reports have rebels moving over
the mountains. But no specific word...

64
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,026
... on Abubakar Al Hassan
or the other leaders.

65
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:54,798
Copy. We've Just cleared
the second waypoint. Over.

66
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,635
They're still on schedule
to set the trap at the Alpha drop.

67
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:00,540
Proceed to your
next waypoint. Over.

68
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:04,449
Roger that, Flight Control.
Eagle One out.

69
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,713
Captain, any news on the target?

70
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,186
Amphibious has Just landed.
Still no word on Al Hassan.

71
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,882
But lntel says
we have a clear flight path...

72
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:18,029
...so we're going to
insert you as quickly as we can.

73
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,498
They say that
it's good luck to be a--

74
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,295
T o have a woman to
bring them to battle.

75
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,769
-Yeah, right.
-Kindly tell Diaz that he gets...

76
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:31,034
...an F on his luck,
and to go do himself.

77
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,707
The AKD has been sending
money and weapons...

78
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,378
...to these rebels for years now.

79
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:41,385
New intelligence tells us that
top AKD leaders are in Mindanao...

80
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,714
...and they are planning
a maJor strike...

81
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,914
-...against the West.
-The West?

82
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,423
Does that include
our allies in the lraq war?

83
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,186
Is Australia the target?

84
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:54,425
Bruce, you know
I can't comment on that.

85
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,899
Gentlemen, ladies...

86
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,834
...thank you for your patience,
that's all for now.

87
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,598
No more questions.

88
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:06,608
At the top level, are we expecting
another World Trade Center?

89
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,006
Please excuse us.

90
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,580
Captain Escalona will answer
any further questions.

91
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,547
-How big, general, would you say?
-How big, what's the scale?

92
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,345
-Later.
-Gentlemen, this way, please.

93
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:22,021
You are clear to insert
the strike team at the Alpha drop.

94
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,559
Over.

95
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:26,698
Roger that, Flight Control,
Eagle One out.

96
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,596
Alex, they say that we're
cleared for the Alpha drop.

97
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:33,465
MaJor, lntel says that the rebels
are still holding tight...

98
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:36,608
...on the beach, but there's
still no word on our target.

99
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,710
Abubakar knows he can't
take us in a straight fight.

100
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,442
I'm hit.

101
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:47,914
We're taking heavy fire.

102
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:54,149
Eagle One to Flight Ops.
We are taking heavy AA ground fire.

103
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:58,321
Flight Control to Eagle One.
Garbled. Repeat. Over.

104
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:06,231
Eagle One hit. Section Delta Five.
Delta Five. Over.

105
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,138
We're losing it.

106
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,568
-We're going down.
-Hang on.

107
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,946
This is it. Hang on.

108
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,320
Hold tight.

109
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,689
Eagle One, respond. Over.

110
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,797
I lost their beacon. Check on 48.3.

111
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,067
Tac Com, get me
505th Rescue.

112
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:42,706
We need a recovery team,
we've got a bird down.

113
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,808
-Chopper down?
-Yes, sir.

114
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,006
Who was on it?

115
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,205
MaJor Aginaldo's strike team...

116
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,475
...and two Americans.

117
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,315
Eagle One down.

118
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,452
Eagle One down. Over.

119
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,655
Eagle One to Flight Control.

120
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,430
Alex.

121
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,366
Alex.

122
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,403
Oh, my God.

123
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,335
Lieutenant Pierce?

124
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,614
Can you move it?

125
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,083
Can you move it?

126
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,228
Oh, Just barely.

127
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,230
You should go.

128
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,871
The rebels who shot us
down can't be far.

129
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,200
I'm not gonna leave you here.

130
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,774
I'm gonna get the
medical kit and we're gonna...

131
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,810
...patch your leg up. And then
we're gonna move out.

132
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:15,092
The rifles must have
fallen out with the crash.

133
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,436
Maybe you should go.

134
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:26,975
You don't know
what the rebels do to women.

135
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,449
Can't be any worse than
what they did to your men.

136
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:36,447
Let's put a splint on that.

137
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:39,956
The rebels are coming.

138
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,117
Leave me.

139
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,424
Leave me. I'll do this.

140
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,335
Do you hear that?

141
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,680
We're not leaving anybody behind.

142
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,517
You good to go?

143
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,692
-Yeah.
-Okay, I'm gonna go pop some smoke.

144
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,328
Flight Control, this is Rescue One.

145
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,596
Entering sector Delta Five, over.

146
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,205
Copy that, Rescue One.

147
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,875
We've got signal smoke.
Confirmed signal smoke.

148
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,509
Secure for extraction. Over.

149
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,475
Copy that,
Rescue One. Commencing.

150
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,027
Rescue One, we've got
a blip on infrared.

151
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,525
Roger that.

152
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:56,860
-Chopper down, chopper down.
-Do you hear that?

153
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,971
Y eah.

154
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:03,898
There's only one plane left.
We better move.

155
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,812
Flight Control, we've lost
Rescue Two. Send backup.

156
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,115
We are returning fire.

157
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:19,050
We gotta go. Move. Move.

158
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,590
Parker.

159
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,490
You stay here. You count to five...

160
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,097
...and hit them with a grenade.

161
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,530
-All right, sir.
-Start counting.

162
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,210
Move out.

163
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:38,397
Get down. Get down.

164
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,098
Cooper. Sniper. You got him?

165
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:42,963
Hundred yards up.

166
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,272
He's ten o'clock high.

167
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,602
Jackson, up front. Stay low.

168
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,348
We got a sniper. Ten o'clock high.

169
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,449
I got him.

170
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,595
-Parker, you all right?
-Yes, sir.

171
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,848
Move out.

172
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,357
Roll over and show me your hands.

173
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,887
Parker. Parker.

174
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,255
Roll over and show me your hands.

175
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:27,138
Alpha squad, sound off!

176
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,379
Jackson, check.

177
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,357
I know it hurts.

178
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,590
Come on. A little bit further.

179
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:50,366
We Just gotta go up to the--

180
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,867
Set me down here.
Set me down here.

181
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,674
I'm slowing you down too much.

182
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:10,548
Marines never leave their own behind.
I'm staying with you.

183
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,748
I outrank you, captain.
This isn't advice.

184
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,859
It's an order.

185
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,397
I know what these rebels are like.

186
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,362
It's better for both of us
if you go on ahead.

187
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,763
They'll Just hold me for ransom.

188
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,801
You're an American.

189
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,198
You know, I'm gonna have
to change these dressings.

190
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:32,138
-I'll take care of it.
-No, I can do this.

191
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:35,336
You Just keep going
back the way we came in.

192
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,310
2nd Army's flushing
the rebels to the south.

193
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,814
Our amphibious assault
is pushing Abubakar's men...

194
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:43,283
...off the beach. This whole place is
about to be surrounded with bogeys.

195
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,389
-MaJor you can't--
-There's good cover here.

196
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:48,151
-You can't Just--
-I'll be fine. Captain, keep going north.

197
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,123
Just keep going north.

198
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:53,158
-Go.
-Yes, sir.

199
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:57,168
Here. You take care.

200
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,963
-Just bring back the cavalry.
-I will.

201
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:07,777
Any sign of Abubakar?

202
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,710
-That's a negative, sir.
-Okay, secure the site.

203
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,384
Roger that. Alpha out.

204
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,016
Found a claymore
and took care of it, sir.

205
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,416
Good. Forward observers spotted...

206
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:21,115
...al-Qaeda leadership moving
toward the mountains.

207
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,090
MaJor Golez and the reinforcement
company are going after them.

208
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:27,197
-And what about us, sir?
-Finish securing the camp.

209
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,630
We rest here tonight. We lead
MaJor Golez tomorrow morning.

210
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,784
Army. Give up or we kill him.

211
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,999
We want ransom.
Don't make us kill you.

212
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:27,550
Hands.

213
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,647
His leg is broken.
You have to pick him up.

214
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,264
Then you carry him.

215
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:57,775
MaJor, come on.

216
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,308
Three. One...

217
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:03,811
...two...

218
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:05,778
...three.

219
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,384
-You got it?
-Yeah.

220
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,627
We walked for hours.

221
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:26,895
To a little village
in the middle of nowhere.

222
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:29,699
The major needed help.

223
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,672
But this was not the place to get it.

224
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,423
Go inside.

225
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,624
Okay.

226
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,487
He needs a doctor.

227
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,091
You take care of him.

228
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,743
Let me see this.

229
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:44,472
I' m sorry.

230
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:50,147
Can't get a body count on this one,
and there's no sign of survivors.

231
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:52,721
Recon Six saw signal smoke.

232
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:54,858
Any draw fire?

233
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:57,651
They launched two Stingers.

234
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,358
At the recon plane.

235
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:04,031
General Lewis, sir, the Pentagon.

236
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,532
If they launch missiles...

237
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:10,503
...on a plane that is that far out...

238
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:13,769
...the AKD must have
bought them a lot of ammo.

239
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:18,182
General Lewis, here.

240
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:20,482
Congratulations, general.

241
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:24,086
Your special ops team was shot
down before they got near the target.

242
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:27,489
You lost two rescue choppers.

243
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,661
And apparently, the survivors
were taken hostage.

244
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,796
Oh, Jesus Christ.

245
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,397
What was that?

246
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:37,762
I said we have a bad line, sir.

247
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:40,767
This is a total command failure.

248
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:42,701
Embarrassing.

249
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,934
We believed our
intelligence to be good.

250
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,476
We based our strategy on it.

251
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,240
The enemy doesn't always do
what you want them to do.

252
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,110
They have a choice too.

253
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:55,684
Damn right. And what do you think
they're gonna do...

254
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,616
... to captured American soldiers?

255
00:25:57,822 --> 00:26:01,485
How do you think the American public
is going to react to a video of....

256
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,388
-Who 's the captain?
-Jennings.

257
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:06,564
Okay. Jennings, begging for life.

258
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,733
You think that's going
to help recruitment?

259
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,959
We' ll get her out, sir.

260
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:14,370
Good. They're your stars.

261
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,070
Y es, sir.

262
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,712
How do we find Jennings?

263
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:32,185
Can't risk another rescue chopper.

264
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,691
Daniels and Montalvo.

265
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:39,853
If there are any survivors, they're
the ones who can get them back.

266
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:45,829
Patrol Three. Confirm orders to
circle back and return to base.

267
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:49,268
Copy that. We got nothing out here.

268
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:55,278
Back home, my daddy used to say...

269
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:00,611
...in order to find north, you look for
the side of the tree with the moss on it.

270
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:04,152
Out here in this Jungle,
you got moss everywhere.

271
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,754
-Yeah, there is.
-Yeah.

272
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,984
What are you
gonna teach your kids?

273
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,663
Oh, I don't have any kids.

274
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,195
Not now, but....

275
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:17,698
-Do you have a husband?
-Not that I've met.

276
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:20,972
-Smart, fine woman like you?
-Thank you.

277
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:26,433
I wouldn't want my wife
to be in a mess like this.

278
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,272
Well...

279
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:32,139
...maybe that's why
I haven't found him yet.

280
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,749
Yeah.

281
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:51,296
You know...

282
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,370
...it was really brave of you
to come back for me.

283
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:55,800
Thanks.

284
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,169
When the opportunity
presents itself...

285
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,473
...you have to escape.

286
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,708
I'm in no shape to go with you.

287
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,180
All right.

288
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,993
Don't you wanna
get some sleep, sir?

289
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,464
I Just wanna get these done.

290
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,141
Get them back to the families.

291
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:36,079
Lieutenant Montalvo's looking
for you. Says we got new orders.

292
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:51,181
When we heard the choppers...

293
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:54,044
...I knew I had a chance to escape.

294
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:56,550
But then I met Abubakar.

295
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:59,086
The man we were sent to catch.

296
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,902
All right.

297
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:19,471
Rebels shot down three of our
helicopters in less then one hour.

298
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:22,646
Flyboys can't get in there,
so they're calling in the grunts.

299
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:25,247
High altitude recon shows
nothing left of the team...

300
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,283
...so we're looking for
survivors from Eagle One.

301
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:31,421
That's the Ranger squad
under MaJor Diego Aginaldo.

302
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:35,423
And two Americans. Special ops
coordinator Lieutenant Mark Pierce...

303
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:38,926
...and Captain Amy Jennings,
pilot out of 3rd Tactical.

304
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,826
The main force will be
pursuing rebel leadership.

305
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:45,230
But they're going
the same place we are.

306
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:47,729
So we're gonna take the river.

307
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:51,136
Get up ahead of them,
deep in rebel territory.

308
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,602
General Bondoc's 2nd Army
is pushing a group of rebels...

309
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:56,177
...up from the south.
That means we've got...

310
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:57,575
...two prongs...

311
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:00,580
...squeezing a whole bunch of
rebels right where we're going.

312
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:03,616
Our Job is to get there first...

313
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:06,153
...and get our Marines back.

314
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,620
Brief your fire teams.
We move out in ten mikes.

315
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:16,612
Lieutenant.

316
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:18,873
What were they doing out here?

317
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,109
Who's that?

318
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,954
The Rangers and that chick pilot.

319
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:33,527
That pilot is a Marine aviator
and a superior officer.

320
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:36,261
No offense, sir...

321
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:39,436
...but I won't even let
my old lady drive my car.

322
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:46,536
She was a counterinsurgency
specialist.

323
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:50,314
HQ sent them out here to capture
one of the rebel leaders.

324
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,483
Abubakar Al Hassan...

325
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:55,345
...al-Qaeda's number two
in Southeast Asia.

326
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,309
Let's get the men ashore.

327
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:41,621
Take cover.

328
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:58,969
Lieutenant Daniels.
Lieutenant Reyes, Philippine army.

329
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:01,172
We were two days
ahead of schedule...

330
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:04,212
-...until they started hitting our flank.
-Sounds like a trap.

331
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:06,315
The rest of the air support
and divisions...

332
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:09,145
...are tied up about 5 klicks back.
What about you guys?

333
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:11,446
Looking for a Huey that went down
in Delta Five.

334
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,624
That's Just the other side
of this mess.

335
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:39,038
Damn, they've got the range.

336
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,615
How about the back side?

337
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:43,283
It's mined.

338
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,478
Jackson.

339
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,484
Get up here.

340
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,152
Got a minefield. Can you clear it?

341
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:52,852
I'm not packing that kind of gear.

342
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:54,861
How about if we
drop a coconut tree?

343
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,397
-That'll work.
-Good, get on it.

344
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:59,364
Roger that, sir.

345
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,306
They won't be expecting us.

346
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,256
Jackson, go.

347
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,647
Move out.

348
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:28,722
Go, go.

349
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:52,059
Two-oh-three!

350
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,497
Two-oh-three!

351
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:04,103
Jackson, I'm in.

352
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,155
Clear.

353
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:22,423
Clear.

354
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,630
All clear.

355
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:41,881
Jackson, you all right?

356
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:44,247
Here comes the cavalry.

357
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,626
I didn't know why I was still alive.

358
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:03,272
But as they took me deeper
into rebel territory...

359
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,965
...it was clear
they wanted something.

360
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,603
She says they left the village.

361
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:26,242
Did they have any prisoners?

362
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:33,983
She says they have
a woman prisoner.

363
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:35,681
They have Captain Jennings.

364
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:40,224
-Abaya, radio.
-Yes, sir.

365
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:49,635
HQ, HQ, this is Alpha Squad.
Come in.

366
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,803
Alpha Squad, HQ. We copy.
Go ahead, identify.

367
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:55,535
This is Lieutenant Daniels, sir.

368
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:57,577
We're in the village
with Lieutenant Reyes.

369
00:46:57,781 --> 00:47:00,306
You got a 20 on Captain Jennings?
Has she been injured?

370
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:02,815
That's negative.
We don't know if she's been inJured.

371
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,113
This search has to go
down fast. You copy that?

372
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,516
Yes, sir.

373
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:08,054
I want you to keep me informed.

374
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:10,249
Roger that, sir. Alpha Squad out.

375
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:13,328
Lieutenant.

376
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:16,528
Any trace of MaJor Aginaldo?

377
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:20,797
No.

378
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,565
Gear up. Get the men out.

379
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,485
You think you are so powerful.

380
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:49,757
That is your destruction.

381
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:53,402
The death of America.

382
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:56,230
It is Allah's Justice.

383
00:47:56,773 --> 00:48:00,869
Soon, your lnfidel cities will die.

384
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:03,340
And so will you.

385
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,173
-Abaya.
-Sir.

386
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:37,677
Radio Lieutenant Reyes
back at the village.

387
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:40,111
Tell him we found
MaJor Aginaldo's body.

388
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:41,875
Yes, sir.

389
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,247
Cooper, move out.

390
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,720
Don't wanna think about what
they're doing to Captain Jennings.

391
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:54,926
Neither do l.

392
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:01,669
Abubakar wanted me to talk.

393
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:05,239
Not for what I knew,
but for what I could say.

394
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:17,213
Government...

395
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:19,355
...and American soldier...

396
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:22,047
...must leave Mindanao.

397
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,850
Say it.

398
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:30,030
Captain Amy Jennings...

399
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:32,098
...United States Marine Corps.

400
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:39,168
Service number 571 84337.

401
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:41,810
God bless Ameri--

402
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:54,316
Government and
American soldiers...

403
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:57,616
...must leave Mindanao.

404
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,759
Say it now.

405
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,368
Captain Amy Jennings...

406
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,166
...United States Marine Corps--

407
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:18,880
Say it.

408
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:26,922
No.

409
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:31,690
Roger that. Alpha out.

410
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,391
Intel doesn't have a damn clue.

411
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,730
Jackson, what do you have
up there?

412
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:43,098
Looks like it gets pretty thick.

413
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:45,998
Coop, what about you?

414
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,910
I got a road leading up.

415
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,738
What do you think?

416
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:56,512
I think straight up.

417
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,851
We'll try to get a view
from a high point.

418
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,250
If we can't see anything...

419
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:03,119
...at least we've got a defensible
bivouac for the night.

420
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:08,530
All right. All right, we're going up.
Move out.

421
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:15,536
What do you mean
he's not in HQ?

422
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,866
-He's not here, sir.
-Can you find him?

423
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,838
-No.
-No?

424
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:22,511
Well, then, where is the general?

425
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:24,942
That's classified information, sir.

426
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:27,207
Roger that. Alpha out.

427
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:28,850
Worthless.

428
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:30,917
They rolled up HQ.

429
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:32,554
Is this operation over?

430
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:36,690
Last we heard, Abubakar was
taking her in that direction.

431
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:38,656
We're not out here
to let her slip away.

432
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:41,126
That bastard. He's got her.

433
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:43,398
Until we get other orders...

434
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,830
...we've got a soldier to save.

435
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:47,970
Let's pack it up. Move it out.

436
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:16,523
Looks like one of ours.

437
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:18,200
It's a dray.

438
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:37,450
Cooper, go.

439
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:39,845
Go, go.

440
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:42,157
Moving out.

441
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,854
Damn, looks like they've got
a lot of firepower out here.

442
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,758
They must have moved up
the assault.

443
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:56,489
Jackson, talk to a supply sergeant.

444
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,930
-See if we can get more ammo.
-Yes, sir.

445
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:03,003
-Coop, you and the men take 1 0.
-Roger that, sir.

446
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:10,976
-How are you doing, sir?
-Hey.

447
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:14,545
General Lewis, sir?
Roger that. This way, sir.

448
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:24,086
-Gentlemen.
-Sir.

449
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:29,063
I'm sorry I can't do more
for you right now.

450
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:31,559
We cannot hold off the assault.

451
00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:35,302
This war is getting bigger than we...

452
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:37,368
...planned for.

453
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:39,397
Mission first.

454
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:41,904
Marine always.

455
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,877
You're doing a good Job, lieutenant.

456
00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:47,709
Keep it up.

457
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:50,719
Yes, sir.

458
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,890
I know the Army's coming.

459
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:40,002
Where is to come?

460
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,363
When will they attack?

461
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:06,858
Where is to come?

462
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:10,425
Where will they attack?

463
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,927
T ell me.

464
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:32,653
I said tell me.

465
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:39,991
I don't know.

466
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:42,858
I don't know.

467
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:54,032
-Hey, Jackson.
-What's up?

468
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,337
You think they get football
on that thing?

469
00:56:58,014 --> 00:57:01,347
Right now I'd settle for some cartoons
and some real breakfast, Coop.

470
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:03,348
Roger that.

471
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,416
All right, guys, rally up.

472
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,636
-Sir, where are those troops going?
-Same place we are, Coop.

473
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:22,805
All right.

474
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:26,501
This is it. The place they're holding
Captain Jennings.

475
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:29,271
Right here.

476
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:32,471
It's heavily fortified and
crawling with bogeys.

477
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:34,411
General Al Fatwa's training camp.

478
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,016
There's only one road into it...

479
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:38,779
...and General Panlilo's
taking the main force right up it.

480
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:41,582
Air support is committed to a rebel
reinforcement column...

481
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:44,157
...moving down the back side
of these mountains.

482
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:47,989
Until the main force gets there,
it's Just us and a whole lot of them.

483
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:52,063
This is General Rashid Al Fatwa.

484
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:53,895
He runs the camp.

485
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:58,339
And lntel's latest photo of
our old buddy Abubakar.

486
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:00,375
They've got Captain Jennings.

487
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:02,545
We're gonna get her out.

488
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:04,975
Intel says Abubakar's
made an alliance...

489
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:07,741
...with the remnants
of another rebel group.

490
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:09,816
That leaves us the hills to the south.

491
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:13,079
Impassable for trucks and
heavy armor. So we're hoofing it.

492
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:16,047
General says the main force
is moving out at zero-nine...

493
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:20,093
...so we're gonna have to haul ass to
get to that camp. Any questions?

494
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,923
Make sure you guys chow down,
have some water...

495
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:24,497
...move out in five mikes.

496
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:26,931
Let's go get our Marine back.

497
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,465
Who's leading the column?

498
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:59,897
Twenty-three, APC.
They move in five minutes.

499
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:02,094
If they move in five minutes,
we'll give...

500
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:06,207
...Daniels and Montalvo a 1 5-minute
head start, at the most.

501
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:09,334
What if we delay the artillery?

502
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,538
Save you a few good men.

503
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:15,016
Orders are orders, general, but...

504
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:18,954
...the Pentagon can kiss my ass.

505
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:03,362
-There's a watchtower.
-Good eyes, Cooper.

506
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:06,030
All right.

507
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:09,271
Let's try to get through that.
Cut to the right.

508
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:12,236
-Right here, single file.
-Roger that, sir.

509
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:14,604
The main force should be
moving already.

510
01:00:14,877 --> 01:00:17,107
Means the base is on the other side.

511
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:20,942
Let's see if we can
get over there undetected.

512
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:33,289
Where is to come?

513
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:35,725
When will be attack?

514
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:41,927
No.

515
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:45,034
Don't.

516
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:48,477
Please?

517
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:08,353
I don't know.

518
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:11,590
-When will be attack?
-I don't know.

519
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:13,860
-T ell me.
-I don't know.

520
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:15,230
T ell me.

521
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:39,954
The main force is late.

522
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:43,123
Maybe the general's
bought us some time.

523
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,829
We've gotta hurry
before the artillery drops on us.

524
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:50,005
Unless we wanna take some
shrapnel up the backside.

525
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:52,874
Guys, pick up and move out.

526
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:54,543
Cooper.

527
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:17,289
Let's move out.

528
01:04:09,645 --> 01:04:11,340
Move. Go.

529
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:21,523
Move out.

530
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:23,192
Go.

531
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:29,262
Go, go. Go, go, go.

532
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,741
Cooper, with me.
We've gotta get some eyes on.

533
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:59,253
-Coordinates, three-five-zero.
-On my command.

534
01:05:01,797 --> 01:05:03,230
Let's move out.

535
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:13,369
Go, go.

536
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,874
Go, go, go.

537
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:23,875
We gotta get inside that building.
Coop, check it out.

538
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:36,189
There's a guy with a video camera.

539
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:38,065
That's it.

540
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:40,497
Probably gonna tape it
for propaganda.

541
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:42,364
What's going on?

542
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:46,369
Couple of guys arguing.

543
01:05:49,412 --> 01:05:51,380
Let me take a look.

544
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:05,223
The guy in black's Abubakar.

545
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:08,991
You want me to take him out?

546
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:10,593
Not yet.

547
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,598
If he's here, he might lead us
to Captain Jennings.

548
01:06:22,878 --> 01:06:25,642
I think the guy with the video camera
is entering the building.

549
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:30,743
-You ready for this?
-Roger that.

550
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:39,154
Let's move out, Coop.

551
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:13,993
Where is the camp?

552
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:15,527
When will they attack?

553
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:18,933
Where is the camp?

554
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:21,228
When will they attack?

555
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:41,279
Lanyard one, fire.

556
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:29,699
Jackson, move.

557
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:38,633
-Two down.
-Center's clear!

558
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:42,775
Jackson, door.

559
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:35,261
Fire.

560
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:40,598
We're a go for second wave.
Over.

561
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:36,455
Man down right. Left clear.

562
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:39,787
-Right clear.
-I'm at the door.

563
01:11:39,995 --> 01:11:43,362
Captain Jennings.
Lieutenant Daniels, USMC.

564
01:11:43,565 --> 01:11:46,033
-Can you walk?
-Yes.

565
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:47,827
Round one.

566
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:47,093
-Good to go?
-I'm good.

567
01:13:13,856 --> 01:13:15,221
I need a new gun.

568
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:16,891
I'm unarmed.

569
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:19,219
I got a flank behind me.

570
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:23,926
Come on, let's go.

571
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:26,067
Aim for the hole.

572
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:54,990
Who wants me?

573
01:13:57,866 --> 01:13:59,060
Stay with me.

574
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:14,180
Jackson, you're the last man in.

575
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:44,069
Cooper, Jackson, let's go.

576
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:46,975
-Now. Move.
-Let's go, Jackson. Let's go.

577
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:49,480
-We're clear. We're clear.
-Move out.

578
01:14:53,589 --> 01:14:56,057
-Two down. Two down.
-Keep moving. Keep moving.

579
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:06,729
We have no word from Daniels.
Assault full ahead. Over.

580
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:41,265
-You okay?
-I'm good.

581
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:44,337
All right. Perimeter's
about a hundred meters south.

582
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,508
-Let's move.
-Wait, lieutenant.

583
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:48,471
They've got anthrax,
a biochemical lab...

584
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:50,542
...Abubakar tried
to get me to make a tape.

585
01:15:50,746 --> 01:15:52,543
He's gonna kill
a whole lot of people.

586
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:56,883
The lab is the last door on the left,
southeast side.

587
01:15:57,953 --> 01:16:00,513
Look, we've gotta burn that anthrax
before they use it.

588
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:02,519
I've got an incendiary.

589
01:16:04,026 --> 01:16:05,926
That'll do. Let's move.

590
01:16:06,128 --> 01:16:07,720
Coop, with me.

591
01:16:30,986 --> 01:16:32,180
Move. Move.

592
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:33,649
Let's move it. Let's go.

593
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:43,423
Go. Go. Go.

594
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:46,027
Go. Let's go. Come on.

595
01:16:52,074 --> 01:16:54,133
Move, move, move.

596
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:01,772
Montalvo, Jennings.

597
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:49,294
These incendiaries burn
at 2400 degrees.

598
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:51,796
I'm gonna make sure
that shit's dead.

599
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:54,958
Are you sure we won't spread it?

600
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:57,202
Gotta trust my demo guy.

601
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:03,676
-It's set.
-All right. Grab your gear. Let's move.

602
01:19:05,707 --> 01:19:07,402
Get down.

603
01:19:47,415 --> 01:19:49,349
Fall back. Fall back.

604
01:19:52,687 --> 01:19:54,882
All my men, fall back.

605
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:04,258
Go, go.

606
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:07,401
Move, move, move. Pull back.

607
01:20:20,415 --> 01:20:22,474
Move, move, move.

608
01:20:22,684 --> 01:20:25,278
Come on, come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

609
01:20:31,726 --> 01:20:33,250
Go. Go.

610
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:37,330
Pull back.

611
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:45,971
Pull back. Go.

612
01:20:56,952 --> 01:20:58,214
Get down.

613
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:08,757
Sound off.

614
01:21:08,964 --> 01:21:11,728
-Cooper's down, Jackson.
-Check.

615
01:21:11,967 --> 01:21:13,935
Montalvo here.

616
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:17,334
-Jennings, you all right?
-Jennings, check.

617
01:22:30,045 --> 01:22:31,307
Friendlies to the left.

618
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:43,387
-Good to see you.
-You okay?

619
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:46,992
Fine, thank you. There was a
biological lab inside. It's pretty nasty.

620
01:22:47,195 --> 01:22:48,389
-Good luck.
-Thank you, sir.

621
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:50,063
Thank you.

622
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,725
Always, sir.

623
01:22:53,935 --> 01:22:55,732
-Johnson.
-Good work, sir.

624
01:22:55,937 --> 01:22:57,131
-Good work.
-Good work.

625
01:22:57,339 --> 01:22:58,806
-Yeah.
-Good work, good work.

626
01:22:59,007 --> 01:23:01,237
-You saved my punk ass.
-You saved my life again.

627
01:23:09,517 --> 01:23:12,042
Thank you, lieutenant.

628
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:14,780
Marines don't leave
their own behind.

629
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:33,338
Lieutenant Daniels got me out alive.

630
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:36,101
I got to thank him in person.

631
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:40,441
But not the men who didn't make it.

632
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:38,838
God, it's still hard to lose them.

633
01:24:50,785 --> 01:24:53,811
You didn't lose anyone, Daniels.

634
01:24:55,023 --> 01:24:57,014
We trained them well.

635
01:24:57,525 --> 01:24:59,584
And we fought hard.

636
01:25:01,129 --> 01:25:03,290
You didn't lose anyone.

637
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:06,826
The rebels took them.

638
01:25:07,035 --> 01:25:09,265
Al-Qaeda took them.
