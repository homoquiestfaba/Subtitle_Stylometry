Seriously, her pussy
is, like, falling out.

4
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,186
Someone needs
to feed that thing

5
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:53,254
Before
it eats her shorts.

What are you faggots
talking about?

8
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,530
No. You must
be mistaken.

9
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,165
We're not gay.

10
00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:06,667
You choads were checking
out my ass, weren't you?

11
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,202
I-I-i wasn't.

12
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:10,371
Well, at least
I'm not gay.

13
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:14,074
Fuck you.

14
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:23,083
Come on. Stick it
in the hole! Yeah!

Bring it, baby.
Bring it, baby.

Let me see you
stick it.

Oh, that's
such a bulge.

00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,793
What is that,
like, 100 pounds?

22
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:33,794
No, it's 40.

23
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:34,795

$300 for the homework.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

67
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,408

like, this time,

instead of money.

Anyway, yeah,
so I made some calls

75
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,424
And, like,
I could get you guys

76
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,626
Into what
promises to be...

77
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,928
Wait for it...

of the decade

79

Tomorrow night.

80
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,737
We're listening.
No, thanks.

81
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,839
Yeah.
No.

82
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:28,208
No.
Yeah.

83
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,611
Right. Well, maybe
you guys have heard

84
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:34,282
Of the Hollywood
fucking hills.

85
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:37,451

working the door,

86
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:40,588
And I can't go
because, uh,

87
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:43,056
Well, I'm fucking
both of your moms

88
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,191
In the ass.

89
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:45,793
Oh, burn!

90
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:47,861
Oh, it burns so good.

91
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:49,497
Jk, bro, jk.

92
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:52,199

probably going to be

Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
no b.S., bra.

97
00:04:00,308 --> 00:04:02,810

but we want the money.

98

100
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,050

maybe you guys,

101
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,085
Like, actually
wanted to get laid

102
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,554
And go to a party

103
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:16,957

Or die.

104

105
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,293
Twice.

106
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:22,262
Yeah, have fun
staying at home

107
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,865
With your whack pack
of super nerd shut-ins.

108
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:25,866
Oh!

109
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:26,667
Doing whatever, man.

110
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,969
All right.
I'll get the cash.

111
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,305
Wait!

112
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:35,676
An opportunity like this

113
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,411
Only comes
once in a lifetime.

114
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:39,279
You let him gyp us
out of $300.

115
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,548
How's that
an opportunity?

116
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:42,416
It's time we stopped
playing video games.

117
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,218
We need to get some tail
physically, not digitally.

118

as us,

a Hollywood party.

122
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:52,393
I'm not going, man.
No way.

123
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:54,795
Dude, don't take
your blue balls out on me

124
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,264
Just because your girlfriend
locked her pussy up in fort knox

125
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:58,799
And gave the key to Jesus.

126
00:04:58,799 --> 00:04:59,767
Shut up, dude.

127
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:02,069
No, I'm not going alone.
You're going.

128
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,604
Well, then
we're not going,

129
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:04,938
And we're out
three bills,

130
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:05,739
So that's great.

131
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:08,442
Fine. I'll go with the clan.

132
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:11,044
The clan?
Yeah, let's see.

133

Canvasses
all of Los Angeles.

137
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,455
I'm pretty sure that
includes the hills.

138
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:23,857
Look, I'm sick and tired

139
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,459
Of you moping around
all the time.

140
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,127
You need to get laid.

141
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,128
Whatever.

142
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,063
No, no.

143
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,331
Just because my grandma

144
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,866
Has a better sex drive
than your girlfriend

145
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:35,202
Doesn't give you an excuse
to be a cock.

146
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,604
Forget about
my relationship.

147
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:38,071
Look, you're either
going solo,

148
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,072
Or you're not going
at all.

149
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,340
And if you do
decide to go,

150
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,575
I'm gonna laugh
my ass off

151
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,977
When you get kicked out.

152
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,047
Speak of the devil
and she appears.

153
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,082
And in her mormon
undergarments, no less.

154
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,384
Shut the fuck up, man.

155
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:52,352
No, dude. It's time
to draw a line in the sand

156
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,554
Or move on.

157
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:54,888
Your virginity's
not getting any younger.

158
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,223
You gonna finally
have the talk?

159
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:57,224
I've been trying.

160
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,258
Hey!

161
00:05:58,258 --> 00:05:59,259
Hello, ed.

162
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,428
Hey.

163
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:01,529
Loser.

164
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:02,730
Goodbye, ed.

165
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,699
[Speaking fantasy language]

166
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:08,936
Yeah.
So I was wondering.

167
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:10,471
Maybe we could go
to nona's tonight

168
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:12,473
And hang out with their
youth group for a while.

169
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:14,642
I don't know, Kim.

170
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:16,910
What do you
not know about?

171
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:22,082
I think just
maybe we should talk.

172
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:24,752
Okay. What's the matter?

173
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:25,986
The same thing
that's been the matter

174
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:27,955
For the past
three and a half years.

175
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:28,889
The sex thing again?

176
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,558
Look, I know
it's a broken record.

177
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:33,293
It's just, I have to...

178
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:34,928
I have to
lay down the law.

179
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,430
The law?

180
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,131
I don't wanna go through
college a virgin.

181
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,600
You know what?

182

00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:24,084
Whoo!
Whoa!

363
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:26,786
Whoo! [Giggles]

364
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:28,988
This is gonna be fun.

365
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:33,326
See that sizzling hot
blonde chick over there?

366
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:39,099
The one next to
that huge mma looking
motherfucker.

367
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:41,034
Affirmative.

368
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,402
Here's what
you're gonna do.

369
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:46,373
You're gonna walk your
puny little ass over there,

370
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:47,807
And you're gonna
ask her,

371
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,410
Can I get
all up in that labe?

372
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,281
Labe? Are you referring

373
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:56,416
To that lady's
labia majora?

374
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,651
Hey, we call it labe
for short.

375
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,123
Kwan.

376
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:06,193
Oh, yes!

377
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,960
Yes, right there.

378
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,962
Oh! Oh, yes.

379
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,499
Holy shit, you better
be recording this.

380
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:13,700
What?

381
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,701
Nothing.

382
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,537
[Moaning]

383
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,272
Oh, yes, ed.

384
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:21,108
Teach my pussy.

385
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:23,443
Sex me, ed.

386
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:25,145
Sex-ed.

387
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,080
Teach my pussy.

388
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,449
Yeah!

389
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:31,651
* you know you gals,
you kind of sexy *

390
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,586
* don't let no man tell you
that you ain't nothing *

391
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:34,921
* they're trying
to abuse you *

392
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,223
* and make you feel like... *

393
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,925
* you can do way, way
better than that *

394
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,093
* you can do way, way... *

395
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:42,929
Oh, man, Ron's gonna
fuck that kid up.

396
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,265
No doubt.

397
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:48,168
Um... Hello. Hi.

398
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,570
Um, those gentlemen
over there

399
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,872
Are asking me
to ask you, um...

400
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:55,208
If I could
get up in your labe.

401
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,076
Excuse me?

402
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,511
If I could
get up in your labe.

403
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,747
But I think they were
referring to you labia majora

404
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,949
Or the fold of skin
on the outsides of your vagina

405
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:04,217
Encasing the vulva.

406
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:06,353
Oh, my fucking God.

407
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:07,420
Ron, did you hear

408
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,888
What he was just
telling me?

409
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:11,458
What's up, babe?

410
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:15,895
What?

411
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,397
Aah!

412
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:20,267
* from there, you can do
way, way better than that *

413
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:24,404
* you can do way, way
better than that *

414
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:27,307
Pshht.
What a dick.

415
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,529
Motherfucker!

416
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:53,132
Shit, is that mellony Adams?

417
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,467
Aah!

418
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:58,305
Oh, my God.
I fucked mellony Adams,

419
00:18:58,305 --> 00:18:59,339
And I have proof.

420
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,140
Best night
of my fucking life.

421
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,176
Oh, my God. Wait until
Doug hears about this.

422
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:05,011
Roll up the window, man.

423
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:07,146
What are you doing?

424
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,317
Oh, my God. Marcus needs
to go to a hospital.

425
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:13,420
You okay?

426
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,954
Did I get to see
her labia?

427
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:18,325
[Speaking
broken English]

428
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:20,693
I deem the knockout
to be worth it.

429
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:23,430
Dudes, we hung out
with actual girls.

430
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,897
I'm glad you're okay.

431
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,400
He's okay.
He's okay. Whoo!

432
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,369
Best 300 bucks
we've ever spent.

433
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,704
Epic win!
Epic win!

434
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,039
Epic won.

435
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,442
* me and my wang *

436
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:37,577
* just hanging out
on the porch *

437
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:39,446
* drinking a beer *

438
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:41,814
* hand down my pants
and doing my thing *

439

* I'm drinking a beer
and playing with my wang *

440

* whoo hoo-hoo
hoo-hoo-hoo *

441

[Imitating guitar solo]

442
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:53,993
Oh, where the fuck
you guys go?

443
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,194
Oh, nowhere,

444
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,064
Except the most
epic party in history.

445
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:00,267
Bam! Go ahead.
Take a look.

446
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:02,969
Wait. Is that...

447
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:04,471
Is that...
Mm-hmm.

448
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:05,938
Mellony motherfucking Adams.

449
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,841
Maybe you've seen her before
in every movie ever made.

450
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:10,977
I hope you enjoyed
your masturbatory evening

451
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:12,745
In solitude, Douglas.

452
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:13,546
Okay, fuck you guys.

453
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,081
Why didn't you
invite me?

454
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:16,249
Next time
don't ruin our raid.

455
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:17,550
Maybe you'll get an invite.

456
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,488
Oh, I've gotta
go to sleep.

457
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:22,622
I think I have
a concussion,

458
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:24,824
And I'm extremely
inebriated.

459
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,092
Me, too.

460
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:28,828
Good night, dick.

461
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,968
All right,
you guys got me.

462
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,837
I'm a douchebag.

463
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:38,771
I'm sorry...

464
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:42,542
That you forgot
your fucking phone.

465
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:44,210
Oh!

466
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,647
You know,
it'd be a goddamn shame

467
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:50,450
If this video were
to somehow make its way

468
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,453
To the worldwide web.

469
00:20:57,524 --> 00:21:00,460
Holy fucking shit. Did
last night really happen?

470
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,262
Yes, it really happened.

471
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,997
I boned mellony Adams?

472
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,165
Yep.

473
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:08,267
And kwan was there, too?

474
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,409
I'm trying to eat.

475
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:26,353
Yep. I got it all
on my phone.

476
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:29,489
Look, you guys can watch
it back a million times
if you want,

477
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,223
But it has to stay
between us, okay?

478
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:32,825
We can get into
a shitstorm of trouble

479
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:34,126
If anybody sees it.

480
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,195
Fuck that. I want
the world to know
what a stud I am.

481
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:37,497
I boned
mellony Adams.

482
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,499
It doesn't get any
non-gayer than that.

483
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:41,233
I'd rather bang
Halle Berry.

484
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,102
Britney! Britney!

485
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:44,504
Or eva Mendez.

486
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:46,138
Emily Addison.

487
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,207
You guys are just jealous
that I dabbled the dipstick

488
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:50,209
In some Hollywood
cream-sashine.

489
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:51,444
Okay, ed, come on.
Seriously.

490
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:52,445
Think about it, okay?

491
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:53,446
We only got into
that party

492
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:54,447
Because of
Delaney's buddy.

493
00:21:54,447 --> 00:21:55,882
We weren't
really invited,

494
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:58,117
So technically
we can get arrested
for trespassing.

495
00:21:58,117 --> 00:22:03,022
Not to mention, we kind of
filmed a sex tape
without consent,

496
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:04,591
So there's always that.

497
00:22:04,591 --> 00:22:06,192
What good
is bonking a babe

498
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:07,794
If I can't tell anybody?

499
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:10,763
It's enough
that we know, right?

500
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:17,704
Oh, my God.
It is you. Sex-ed.

501
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:20,339
Oh, my God.
And you're kwan-zai.

502
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,074
Oh, and you poor baby.

503
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,209
Got your jaw broken

504
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:24,744
Without having
any of the fun.

505
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:27,146
Actually, it's just a contusion
of the zygomatic bone

506
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:30,082
With some secondary bruising
on the left mandible.

507
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,485
Whatever. [Laughs]

508
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:33,753
Well, we look forward

509
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:36,022
To seeing more of you
in action, stud.

510
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:39,526
Come on.

511
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:43,763
All: Fucking Doug!

512
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:48,468
Hey! Hey! Hey, dude.

513
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:50,837
Hey. Hey. Hey.

514
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:53,506
Hey, you!

515
00:22:53,506 --> 00:22:54,507
Hey, sweetie.

516
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:55,642
What the heck, Ross?

517
00:22:55,642 --> 00:22:56,909
You don't answer
my texts now?

518
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:58,778
When? Oh, nona's.

519
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:01,347
Yeah, nona's
I waited there for two hours

520
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:02,348
Looking like a jerk.

521
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:03,950
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

522
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,084
Let's do it tonight.

523
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:06,285
I have study group.

524
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:08,888
I promise I'll
make it up to you
sometime, okay?

525
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,156
Num-num!

526
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,427
Bye.
Num-num.

527
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:17,296
Dude, no one
turns me away like that.

528
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:18,297
Dude.

529
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:20,299
You wanna
try it again?

530
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:21,501
Yeah, let's get back.

531
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:22,969
Oh, man, did you
moisturize this morning?

532
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:25,071
Yeah, every morning.
Of course I did.

533
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:29,742
[Moaning]

534
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,679
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

535
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:34,781
Hold up. Hold up.

536
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:39,552
Doug, bend over so I can
burn your fucking balls.

537
00:23:39,552 --> 00:23:40,987
Oh, hey! Hey, man!

538
00:23:40,987 --> 00:23:42,421
She was about to stick
her whole foot
in her mouth.

539
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,190
You get on that
pornderosa site right now

540
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,424
And take down that video.

541
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,594
I don't know what
you're talking about.

542
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:49,328
You post last night's
sexcapade

543
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:51,564
On a fucking porn site

[Clapping]

545
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:56,068
You figure that all out
by yourself, Sherlock?

546
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:59,405
But once again,
you're only half right.

547
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:01,474
You see, a video
of that great quality

548
00:24:01,474 --> 00:24:02,742
Deserves its own website

549
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:04,844
So that everyone can
see it in all its glory,

550
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:06,479
And I would hate
to deprive people

551
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:08,180
Of that now. [Laughs]

552
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,050
I'm gonna shove that mouse
right down your fucking piehole

If you don't
take it down right now.

00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:15,187

are a little too late.

Check it out.

No, not awesome.

Okay.

That's it.
Get rid of this.

gonna get that kind

00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:26,593
Which one do you think
is the mastermind?

579
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:32,999
It sure as hell
ain't Jackie Robinson
over here.

is mellony Adams.

against her will,

Recorded it and put it
on the Internet.

604
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:52,912
It wasn't against her will.

wanted my rod.

don't want to see

going to end up

sounds like a lot,

But there's five of us.

639
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,673
We could donate blood.

of $20,000.

20 extra kidneys stashed away,

That ain't gonna work.

644
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,919
We could rob a bank.

645
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:14,653
Rob a bank
to not go to jail.

646
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:16,055

with ideas here.

It's your great ideas
that got us into this
in the first place.

stayed at home
with your girlfriend

the most serious injuries.

shut up please.

658
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,319
We could strip our way
to a half million
no problem.

wouldn't shave my bush.

to half a mil.

the way and make a porn?

No, dude,

666
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:42,374
We can't strip our way
to a half million,

667
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:44,310
But we can
screw our way to it.

668
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,978
We've just got to make
more sex tapes.

669
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:47,846

opposite

we should do.

Dude, dude,
all we have to do

00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,985
Is find some willing
has-been celebrities

673
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:55,454
And convince them
to have sex on camera.

674
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:57,423
It's insane exposure.

talking about all day

676
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,960
Is mellony Adams.

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,695
Just the pervs
on campus, man.

678
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,264
Not actually.

679
00:31:05,264 --> 00:31:07,233

pretty hard.

Top five searches
on the Internet.

681
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:14,840
Okay. Why can't they
just make their own tapes?

682
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,342
I mean, why
would they need us?

683
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:17,876
'Cause we've got
a proven track record.

the websites.

We'll watch
the cash roll in.

I just...

692
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:34,893
You got
any better ideas?

693
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:36,895
I didn't think so.

694
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,698
Where can we find
a chick

695
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:40,832
That's desperate enough

696
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:43,135
To bang her way
back to fame?

697
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:48,274
I know of a venue
that will have

female individuals
in attendance currently.

a valkyrie berserker

swords,

through five.

Dude, I'll totally
ragnarok her world.

704
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,369
Hi, Mrs. Jones.

705
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:19,471
I really like it
in episode 312

706
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:21,073
When you beheaded
the evil hydro

707
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:23,409
After drinking
the invincibility potion.

708
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:25,344
Thanks, kid.

an autograph or...

Oh, will you have
sexual intercourse

711
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:31,117
With my friend ed
and allow us to videotape it

712
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:34,020
So that we can make money
and pay off someone
who's blackmailing us?

713
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,056

get weirder every year.

He's just joking.

He's just acting out a scene
in episode 478.

716
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:45,431
You know, when
the evil prince comes...

717
00:32:45,431 --> 00:32:47,866
That's crazy.
There's no episode...

718
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:49,035
[Coughs] Shut up.

719
00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:50,969
It'll be a tremendous
for your career.

720
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,972
Just let ed and I
do it, okay?

721
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,241
You got to find
the right chick,

722
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:57,743
One who's washed up.

723
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:02,348
Desperate, but still
kind of hot.

724
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:07,053
Someone with a bit
of a sexy background.

725
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:12,124
Forget it, man.
This isn't going to work.

726
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:14,193
Let's just
go pack for jail.

727
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,462
Bingo!

728
00:33:16,462 --> 00:33:19,098
[Chuckles]

729
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:20,366
Jillian baines.

730
00:33:20,366 --> 00:33:21,767
Lieutenant commander zolara

731
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:23,635
On orient five
seasons one through four.

732
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:25,771
Zolara was a completely
realistic android

733
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:28,107
With six times the intensity
of normal human strength

734
00:33:28,107 --> 00:33:29,341
And telescopic vision.

735
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,743
She died saving
the starship hyperion

736
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:34,146
From a quantum singularity.

737
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:36,282
Fascinating.
I've heard about her.

738
00:33:36,282 --> 00:33:38,550
The show's creators
killed her character off

739
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:41,019
After some nude photos
of her surfaced...

740
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,154
Which I still own,
by the way...

741
00:33:42,154 --> 00:33:44,423
Plus she is a total drunk.

742
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:46,192
Never showed up
to the set on time.

743
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,164
Ahh... Yeah.

744
00:33:52,164 --> 00:33:53,699
What are you doing?

745
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:56,435
Excuse me?

746
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:59,171
Look at all these
dried up old hags

747
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:00,539
Trying to cling
to the last bit of money

748
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,475
They can make for a job
they did 10 years ago.

749
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:06,478
But you...
You're in your prime.

750
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:08,347
You just need
the right opportunity.

751
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:10,282
Are you trying
to sell something?

752
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:12,684
Because I can
call security, all right?

753
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:15,154
You got to register
three weeks in advance

754
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:17,223
If you wanna be
a vendor here.

755
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:18,424
The only thing
I'm trying to sell you

756
00:34:18,424 --> 00:34:20,626
Is a chance to
reinvigorate your career.

757
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,132
Do you have an Uncle

758
00:34:26,132 --> 00:34:28,066
That's the head
of a studio or something?

759
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,669
Better. I'm the studio,
the agent,

760
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:32,504
And the costar.

761
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:35,006
You ever heard
of a little thing
called the Internet?

762
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,842
Are you retarded?

763
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:38,477
Like a fox.

764
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:39,945
Did you see
that little video

765
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:41,213
With mellony Adams?

766
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:43,482
Yeah. It's blowing up
everywhere.

767
00:34:43,482 --> 00:34:46,084
It's on tmz,
entertainment tonight, extra.

768
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,420
Everybody's
talking about it.

769
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,823
I would kill
for that kind of coverage.

770
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:53,024
You don't have to kill.

771
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:54,826
I'm the guy
in that video.

772
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,962
You?

773
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:58,297
Me.

774
00:34:58,297 --> 00:35:02,534
You know they're calling you
sex-ed on the blogs.

775
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:04,203
Oh, yeah.

776
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:07,339
So you're offering...

777
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:09,575
A refresher course.

778
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:11,410
Hmm.

779
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:19,651
All right, I'll fuck you.

780
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:20,819
[Chuckles]

781
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:25,491
But it's gonna take
a lot of liquid courage.

782
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,496
Show's over.

783
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:41,139
Aw, damn it. It's not
the right mount.

784
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,642
Tripod shots are 75%
steadier than handheld,

785
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,477
And that number
goes up to 350%

786
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:48,414
For shots zoomed in
more than four times.

787
00:35:48,414 --> 00:35:50,616
Shut up.
Get the lube.

788
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,024
Ooh.

789
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:01,727
You know, if ed can't do
this whole thing by himself.

790
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:05,197
I can always jump in
and take over, you know.

791
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:07,299
Sorry, fat-ass.
This is a one-man show.

792
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:09,067
Just get
the website together, okay?

793
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:10,302
All right,
come on, guys.

794
00:36:10,302 --> 00:36:12,638
She's gonna be here
any second. Let's go.

795
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:20,746
Hello.

796
00:36:20,746 --> 00:36:22,548
So...

797
00:36:22,548 --> 00:36:26,852
Who wants to fuck
the hottest robot
in this quadrant? Huh?

798
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,854
Huh? You?

799
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:30,088
Ooh.

800
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:32,023
Somebody's
ready to launch.

801
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,159
Over here.
Over here!

802
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:37,496
Oh, yes.
There's my stud.

803
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:41,199
So you gonna fuck me
like mellony?

804
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,734
Are you?

805
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:44,670
Hell, yeah.

806
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:49,140
Action!

807
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,042
I don't wanna film this.

808
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,478
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

809
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:59,084
My mission is to
find out what happens

810
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:02,754
When you stick
your probe balls deep.

811
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:04,256
[Laughs]

812
00:37:04,256 --> 00:37:06,157
Party time, space girl.

813
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,694
Yeah. Huh?

814
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:15,534
Okay.

815
00:37:15,534 --> 00:37:18,236
[Laughs] Ooh,
robot on robot sex

816
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,839
Is hot and heavy.

817
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,908
Oh, yeah, baby. Ooh.

818
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:24,042
I was sent to study

819
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:25,911
The sexual
reproduction rituals

820
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:27,613
Of your species.

821
00:37:27,613 --> 00:37:29,915
Huh? I'm
a fucking android.

822
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,350
I don't have a species.

823
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,184
Excuse me, but
technically speaking,

824
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:34,453
Androids
can build other androids

825
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:36,187
And therefore be
classified as a species.

826
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:37,956
Get out of the shot.

827
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:38,957
All right. All right.

828
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:40,091
Where was I?

829
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,193
Oh, yeah.
I was about to insert

830
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,896
My hard disk
into your v-drive unit.

831
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:46,465
[Moaning]

832
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:48,467
Oh, God. [Chuckles]

833
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:51,470
Next mission, you're
gonna drill for oil

834
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,472
On the moon. [Laughs]

835
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:54,806
Negative. Negative.
Negative.

836
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:57,809
No, no. We are going
to stick to cave exploration

837
00:37:57,809 --> 00:37:59,077
On this expedition.

838
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:01,413
Fine. Yeah,
give it to me.

839
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:04,416
[Moaning]

840
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:05,784
You've penetrated.

841
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,554
You've penetrated
my force field.

842
00:38:08,554 --> 00:38:10,422
You're gonna have
to make a direct hit

843
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:12,157
To make me cum. Yeah.

844
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:14,025
Stay on target.
Stay on target.

845
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:15,761
Aah! Aah! Aah!

846
00:38:15,761 --> 00:38:18,564
Ohh...

847
00:38:18,564 --> 00:38:20,766
Oh, God. Look at
the size of that thing.

848
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:26,338
Kwan-zai!

849
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:28,073
[Splat]

850
00:38:46,592 --> 00:38:48,594
Hey, Ross, it's Kim.

851
00:38:48,594 --> 00:38:51,797
Uh, just calling
to say hello.

852
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:56,702
So where have you been,
silly goose?

853
00:38:56,702 --> 00:39:00,439
I've just, you know, been
worried sick about you,

854
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:04,376
And, um... All right,
well, just call me

855
00:39:04,376 --> 00:39:07,713
When you're not
too busy, I guess.

856
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:09,581
Bye.

857
00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:15,821
Arghhhh!

858
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:21,893
Holy fucking shit.

859
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:25,163
Up to 17 million hits
in only three days.

860
00:39:25,163 --> 00:39:26,732
Unbelievable.

861
00:39:26,732 --> 00:39:29,267
Taking into account
the exponential nature
of these videos

862
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:31,637
With a minimal
coefficient of 16.3,

863
00:39:31,637 --> 00:39:34,406
And now with two videos,

864
00:39:34,406 --> 00:39:35,507
If you refresh the screen,

865
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:39,611
We should have
17,274,000 hits now.

866
00:39:45,684 --> 00:39:47,953
That mans with
the advertising revenue

867
00:39:47,953 --> 00:39:51,590
Growing at a rate
of 14.43 per 300k,

868
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:54,793
That we will be able to
come up with the money.

869
00:39:54,793 --> 00:39:57,195
We just need to keep
producing videos.

870
00:39:57,195 --> 00:39:58,329
We need to find
some new girls.

871
00:39:58,329 --> 00:39:59,865
Where do we go
to find them?

872
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:02,067
Uh, guys.

873
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:04,402
I don't think that's
gonna be a problem.

874
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:11,610
[Laughs]

875
00:41:00,726 --> 00:41:02,127
We need
to hang out more, Ross.

876
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:04,596
I feel like I haven't
seen you in forever.

877
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:07,065
Yeah, I know.
I've just been really busy

878
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:09,635
With studying, school,
and stuff, you know.

879
00:41:09,635 --> 00:41:11,737
Yeah, well, you should
come to my study group.

880
00:41:11,737 --> 00:41:14,072
I think it would really
help you concentrate.

881
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:16,908
Like, I really don't see
how you get anything done

882
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:20,111
Living in that house
with a bunch of losers.

883
00:41:22,514 --> 00:41:25,050
Ross?

884
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,652
Ross?

885
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:28,887
Have you heard
anything I just said?

886
00:41:28,887 --> 00:41:30,522
Huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Studying.

887
00:41:30,522 --> 00:41:31,690
We can do that sometime.

888
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,358
Yeah, look, I gotta
get back to work...

889
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:35,994
Uh, studying for work.

890
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:36,995
Okay.

891
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,396
I gotta go, okay?

892
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:40,532
Bye.
Yeah.

893
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:42,534
Uh, Ross?

894
00:41:42,534 --> 00:41:44,903
Isn't it that way?

895
00:41:44,903 --> 00:41:47,238
Yeah. [Laughs]
Guess so.

896
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:48,707
Thank you.

897
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:54,045
Okay, so who's
up to bat?

898
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:57,949
Former reality TV
personality Debbie Ballard.

899
00:41:57,949 --> 00:41:59,851
She's the one
that ate that bull cock

900
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,953
To win a challenge.

901
00:42:05,724 --> 00:42:08,627
Sorry, kwan. She's actually
got a special request.

902
00:42:10,596 --> 00:42:13,398
Nope. Black.

903
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:15,266
Classic mud shark.

904
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:18,469
Marcus.

905
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:19,738
I can't.

906
00:42:19,738 --> 00:42:21,272
Sure, you can.
It's easy.

907
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:25,577
In, out, in, out,
in, out.

908
00:42:25,577 --> 00:42:26,578
I can't do it.

909
00:42:26,578 --> 00:42:27,846
It's gonna be outside,

910
00:42:27,846 --> 00:42:29,347
So it'll help you
with your claustrophobia.

911
00:42:29,347 --> 00:42:31,382
We're actually going
for some better
production value.

912
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,284
Seriously,
I don't think I can.

913
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:34,886
You can
and you will.

914
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,057
Okay.

915
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:42,093
Okay.

916
00:42:42,093 --> 00:42:43,895
Good.

917
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:46,297
Better dust off
your cock, knave.

918
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:47,298
You're on deck.

919
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:49,567
No, not happening.
No way.

920
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,803
Yes way.

921
00:42:51,803 --> 00:42:53,071
You know how much
money we'd make

922
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,506
If you lost
your cherry on camera?

923
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:58,176
Virgins are
big business, dude.

924
00:42:58,176 --> 00:42:59,510
Like, I don't care.

925
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,846
Look, I don't mind
helping you guys out,

926
00:43:00,846 --> 00:43:04,616
But I will never, ever
have sex on camera, okay?

927
00:43:04,616 --> 00:43:06,017
Shut the fuck up, you two.

928
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:08,754
We're gonna be late
for Marcus' scene.

929
00:43:08,754 --> 00:43:11,356
It's time to build
the course.

930
00:43:12,624 --> 00:43:14,693
[Gulp]

931
00:43:14,693 --> 00:43:15,961
[Whistle]

932
00:43:15,961 --> 00:43:18,997
Challenger,
in order to win this,

933
00:43:18,997 --> 00:43:21,900
You must up that bucket
with water.

934
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,736
That doesn't sound hard.

935
00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:26,337
You have 30 seconds

936
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:28,874
While I shoot at you
with a paintball gun.

937
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:31,476
Go!

938
00:43:31,476 --> 00:43:32,510
Ow! Ow!

939
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:34,680
Ow! Ow! Oh, God!

940
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,347
Move it, you loser.

941
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,618
I'm coming.

942
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:44,355
Move it!

943
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:45,590
I'm coming. Oh, God.

944
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,759
I'm coming.
Come on!

945
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:49,227
Come on, you pussy!

946
00:43:53,031 --> 00:43:54,165
Hey!

947
00:43:54,165 --> 00:43:55,734
I'm coming.

948
00:43:56,768 --> 00:43:59,104
I'm coming.
Four!

949
00:43:59,104 --> 00:44:00,038
One!

950
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:05,176
You did it!

951
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:07,145
[Panting]

952
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,019
Come claim your prize.

953
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:15,821
Okay.

954
00:44:16,788 --> 00:44:19,490
Time to go head first.

955
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,992
Yeah!

956
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,193
Whoa.

957
00:44:22,193 --> 00:44:25,731
That's it.
Munch away, brother.

958
00:44:25,731 --> 00:44:27,799
Like mashed potatoes
and gravy.

959
00:44:27,799 --> 00:44:30,001
Oh! Oh, yeah.

960
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,937
[Gasping]
I can't breathe.

961
00:44:31,937 --> 00:44:34,339
My pussy's got
all the oxygen you need.

962
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:36,374
Actually, there's
only 6.8 ounces of oxygen

963
00:44:36,374 --> 00:44:37,809
In the average vagina.

964
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:39,210
That would last
a man my size

965
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:42,147
About 12 uninterrupted
minutes theoretically.

966
00:44:42,147 --> 00:44:43,248
Shut up!

967
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:47,052
Yeah! Yeah!

968
00:44:48,553 --> 00:44:51,122
Aah! I'm gonna blow!

969
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:51,923
What?

970
00:44:51,923 --> 00:44:55,026
I'm a squirter. Yeah!

971
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:55,827
[Splat]

972
00:44:55,827 --> 00:44:58,964
Aah! Aah!

973
00:44:58,964 --> 00:45:00,365
Aah!

974
00:45:05,837 --> 00:45:07,472
My inhaler.

975
00:45:07,472 --> 00:45:08,740
My inhaler.

976
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,008
My inhaler.

977
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:12,643
So is she.

978
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:15,380
[Groaning]
My inhaler!

979
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:19,217
Oh, my God.
That's that guy.

980
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:20,651
That's ed.

981
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:22,387
I heard he boned
raven Simone.

982
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:23,822
Yeah?
Yeah.

983
00:45:23,822 --> 00:45:25,090
And tea-bagged Meg Ryan.

984
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:26,324
Fuck, yeah.
[Laughs]

985
00:45:26,324 --> 00:45:28,693
I mean, you got to
make sure to moisturize.

986
00:45:28,693 --> 00:45:30,028
It's the most
important thing.

987
00:45:30,028 --> 00:45:32,463
Dude, I only use lotion
for when I masturbate.

988
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:34,866
Dude, you're not
even capitalizing

989
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:36,134
On what lotion can do.

990
00:45:36,134 --> 00:45:37,468
I mean, dude,
check out my muscles.

991
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:38,636
Let me get some of that.

992
00:45:38,636 --> 00:45:40,038
Get some.
Get on that.

993
00:45:40,038 --> 00:45:42,040
Why would you even be
waiting on anything?

994
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,541
I mean, just do it.

995
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:46,411
Right?

996
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:47,545
So soft and...

997
00:45:47,545 --> 00:45:48,579
Ed!

998
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:49,647
Ed, dude!

999
00:45:49,647 --> 00:45:51,416
What's up, brah?
Come here.

1000
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:53,651
Yeah, bring it in, ed.
Bring it in.

1001
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:54,719
Yeah, what's...

1002
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:56,154
Hey. Oh, dude,

1003
00:45:56,154 --> 00:45:57,789
You should come
by the house tonight.

1004
00:45:57,789 --> 00:45:59,891
Oh, man,
it's going to be a rager.

1005
00:45:59,891 --> 00:46:01,692
Oh, man, we're
gonna have kegs,

1006
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:03,428
Drugs. [Laughs]

1007
00:46:03,428 --> 00:46:04,529
Sluts. Sluts.

1008
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:05,797
Definitely sluts.

1009
00:46:05,797 --> 00:46:07,198
All right,

1010
00:46:07,198 --> 00:46:10,768
Who's the next contestant
on "fuck me famous"?

1011
00:46:13,071 --> 00:46:15,173
We're still getting a shit ton
of fucking emails.

1012
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:17,742
I just got one
from a Liz Cooper.

1013
00:46:17,742 --> 00:46:19,010
Liz Cooper played
coach shearson

1014
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:20,912
In seasons two and three
of hoops high.

1015
00:46:20,912 --> 00:46:23,281
Okay.
Uh, Katie Mayer.

1016
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:25,016
Katie Mayer played
janey the secretary

1017
00:46:25,016 --> 00:46:26,852
On the first season
of Chicago sons.

1018
00:46:26,852 --> 00:46:28,619
Holy shit.

1019
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,823
She just sent us a nice little
photo of herself here.

1020
00:46:36,394 --> 00:46:37,595
Look at that ass.

1021
00:46:37,595 --> 00:46:38,629
Marcus!
Ross?

1022
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,198
Asperger.
Uh, Marcus?

1023
00:46:40,198 --> 00:46:41,833
You're acting
really weird today.

1024
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:44,102
Did you
take your medicine?

1025
00:46:44,102 --> 00:46:45,236
What, nothin'.
Oh, hi.

1026
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:46,872
Hey, babe,
what's going on?

1027
00:46:48,273 --> 00:46:49,340
Hi.

1028
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,576
Uh, what's going
on here, Ross?

1029
00:46:51,576 --> 00:46:54,379
Oh,
just hangin' out.

1030
00:46:54,379 --> 00:46:55,780
Bein' dudes.

1031
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,615
Looking at dirty porno
on the Internet.

1032
00:46:57,615 --> 00:46:58,616
[Laughter]

1033
00:46:58,616 --> 00:47:00,218
Jk, no we're not.

1034
00:47:00,218 --> 00:47:03,388
We're playing card games
and such.

1035
00:47:03,388 --> 00:47:06,257
[Laughs]

1036
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:09,427
Oh, well, well.
What have we here?

1037
00:47:09,427 --> 00:47:12,030
Looks like our friend
Jillian bane

1038
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:15,100
Just got a series regular gig
on the new CSI: Jersey.

1039
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,301
She's going to be playing

1040
00:47:16,301 --> 00:47:19,604
A junkie hooker-
slash-police informant.

1041
00:47:19,604 --> 00:47:20,939
Huh. Wow.

1042
00:47:20,939 --> 00:47:22,707
She went from not working
for the past six years

1043
00:47:22,707 --> 00:47:26,044
To getting a series regular
gig on a big network show.

1044
00:47:26,044 --> 00:47:29,480
Wonder what
caused that, Ross.

1045
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,681
What?
I wouldn't know.

1046
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,849
I don't know.

1047
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,251
Yeah, um...

1048
00:47:33,251 --> 00:47:36,621
Ross,
can I talk to you outside?

1049
00:47:36,621 --> 00:47:37,923
Of course.

1050
00:47:41,626 --> 00:47:43,294
Dick.

1051
00:47:43,294 --> 00:47:46,031
Hey, if I'm not
getting laid, nobody is.

1052
00:47:50,735 --> 00:47:53,071
So, uh,
what's going on?

1053
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:54,439
You're not
answering my texts,

1054
00:47:54,439 --> 00:47:55,974
Your phone goes
straight to voicemail.

1055
00:47:55,974 --> 00:47:57,943
I mean, if I didn't
know any better,

1056
00:47:57,943 --> 00:48:00,845
It's like you're
trying to avoid me.

1057
00:48:00,845 --> 00:48:02,313
No. I'm not...

1058
00:48:02,313 --> 00:48:03,414
I don't know.

1059
00:48:03,414 --> 00:48:05,450
I've just been really
busy with, you know,

1060
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:08,819
School and studying
and other stuff.

1061
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:11,256
But, hey,

1062
00:48:11,256 --> 00:48:13,624
You know you're the most
important thing to me, right?

1063
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:15,860
Right?

1064
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,229
I'm sorry I've been
a bit distant lately.

1065
00:48:20,165 --> 00:48:22,767
Um, I was on the hill
just now and I saw ed,

1066
00:48:22,767 --> 00:48:24,202
And, you know,
palling around

1067
00:48:24,202 --> 00:48:27,072
With, um, Delaney mulroy
and, um...

1068
00:48:27,072 --> 00:48:29,174
Anyways, he gave me
a letter for you,

1069
00:48:29,174 --> 00:48:31,776
Told me
to give it to you.

1070
00:48:31,776 --> 00:48:33,178
Really?

1071
00:48:37,348 --> 00:48:39,417
Ed:
"Ross dog, sex ed here.

1072
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:42,320
"I'm taking a little vacation
from fucking on camera.

1073
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,521
"Me and Delaney
are going to slay

1074
00:48:43,521 --> 00:48:45,190
"Some sorority gash
all weekend.

1075

Bucky, fuck me!

1256
00:56:49,306 --> 00:56:50,908
Oh, she's got
some serious issues.

1257
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:52,510
She played
cheerleader Abby Collins

1258
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:54,211
On lakeway heights
for six seasons.

1259
00:56:54,211 --> 00:56:57,114
After the show was canceled,
she played another cheerleader,

1260
00:56:57,114 --> 00:57:01,285
Darcy cummings, on thousand
palms for four seasons.

1261
00:57:01,285 --> 00:57:03,220
Yeah, I love it when
you talk dirty to me.

1262
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:04,388
Talk dirty to me.

1263
00:57:04,388 --> 00:57:06,390
Okay, um...

1264
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:07,525
You like bucky, bitch?

1265
00:57:07,525 --> 00:57:09,494
No!
No?

1266
00:57:09,494 --> 00:57:11,562
No, say it like bucky.

1267
00:57:11,562 --> 00:57:12,797
Say it like bucky.

1268
00:57:12,797 --> 00:57:15,566
[High-pitched voice]
You like bucky, bitch?

1269
00:57:15,566 --> 00:57:18,135
No, chirp

1270
00:57:18,135 --> 00:57:19,670
Chirp, motherfucker!

00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:47,565
I'm not here.
No.

1283
00:57:47,565 --> 00:57:49,366
All right, get going.

1284
00:57:49,366 --> 00:57:50,901
Hey, guys.
Hi, Kimberly.

1285
00:57:50,901 --> 00:57:52,302
Where's, uh...

1286
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,704
What happened to you?

1287
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,609
Okay, whatever.
Where's Ross?

1288
00:57:58,609 --> 00:58:02,212
He's not here right now
in this room.

1289
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:03,548
Not right now.

1290
00:58:03,548 --> 00:58:06,450
We'll tell him you
stopped by.

1291
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:07,552
What are you wearing?

1292
00:58:07,552 --> 00:58:09,820
Black people clothes.

1293
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,822
[Girl moaning]
What was that?

1294
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:14,525
We are performing a live action
role playing exercise.

1295
00:58:14,525 --> 00:58:16,060
Yeah. [Chirping]

00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:21,198
Okay, okay,
you guys have fun.

1298
00:58:22,366 --> 00:58:23,801
Tell Ross to call me.

1299
00:58:23,801 --> 00:58:25,369
Okay.

1300
00:58:25,369 --> 00:58:26,837
Bye.

1301
00:58:29,774 --> 00:58:32,710
Oh, God, I almost had
a fucking heart attack.

1302
00:58:39,316 --> 00:58:42,086
[Laughing]

1303
00:58:43,287 --> 00:58:44,722
Dude, brah!

1304
00:58:44,722 --> 00:58:47,357
Oh, man.
Way to pound it, sex ed.

1305
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,093
Yeah.

1306
00:58:49,093 --> 00:58:50,294
What a freak.

1307
00:58:50,294 --> 00:58:52,096
And I think I almost
threw my back out, too.

1308
00:58:53,931 --> 00:58:56,066
What's wrong with you?

1309
00:58:56,066 --> 00:58:59,469
Oh, my God. Kim
almost busted us, man.

1310
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:00,805
Oh, my God.

1311
00:59:00,805 --> 00:59:02,272
If she would've known
I was in here,

1312
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:04,775
She'd have grabbed a knife
and killed us all.

1313
00:59:04,775 --> 00:59:05,810
She would have.

1314
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:08,345
Hey, there,
chirpy chippers.

1315
00:59:08,345 --> 00:59:10,314
Where the hell do
you think you're going?

1316
00:59:10,314 --> 00:59:12,082
I wasn't done with you.

1317
00:59:12,082 --> 00:59:13,350
Sorry, babe.

1318
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:16,120
This squirrel's busted
his last nut for the night.

1319
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:19,089
You're a goddamn chipmunk,
not a squirrel.

1320
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:25,295
Hey, babe!

1321
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:27,297
Oh! I've missed you.

1322
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:28,298
So you're here.

1323
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:29,934
Give me a kiss, num nums.

1324
00:59:29,934 --> 00:59:31,268
How you doing?
So you're here.

1325
00:59:31,268 --> 00:59:32,870
Yeah.
Um, I was just...

1326
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:34,739
I was coming back 'cause I
want to give you a note.

1327
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:35,840
Well, I'm here now.

1328
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,474
You can just
tell me what it says.

1329
00:59:37,474 --> 00:59:40,778
Well, no. I think you'd
really like what's in it.

1330
00:59:40,778 --> 00:59:42,980
Oh.
Yeah.

1331
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:44,314
Okay.

Oh. Oh, it...
Yeah.

1334

Yeah?

1335
00:59:49,987 --> 00:59:51,488
You know,
I think it's about time.

1336
00:59:51,488 --> 00:59:52,723
Yeah?

1337
00:59:52,723 --> 00:59:54,825
Yeah, me... me, too.

1338
00:59:54,825 --> 00:59:57,094
Look really, me, too. I...

1339
00:59:57,094 --> 01:00:00,430
But not now.
Like, not here, I mean...

1340
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,999
Maybe somewhere special...

1341
01:00:01,999 --> 01:00:04,268
Hey, Ross, you want
to be my sex chipmunk?

1342
01:00:05,502 --> 01:00:06,771
Oh, hi. I'm Mandy,

1343
01:00:06,771 --> 01:00:08,673
And I love girl-on-girl.

1344
01:00:08,673 --> 01:00:10,407
I don't know her.

1345
01:00:10,407 --> 01:00:11,809
I don't know her.

1346
01:00:12,677 --> 01:00:14,712
Really? Kim!

1347
01:00:14,712 --> 01:00:16,613
What's her problem?

1348
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:21,585
Atten hut!

1349
01:00:21,585 --> 01:00:24,488
Ten hut,
general Dougie, sir.

1350
01:00:24,488 --> 01:00:26,056
At ease, ladies.

1351
01:00:26,056 --> 01:00:28,693
Now drop and give me 69.

1352
01:00:28,693 --> 01:00:31,295
Oh, yes general Dougie,
sir.

1353
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:34,598
Right after I examine
corporal Gina here

1354
01:00:34,598 --> 01:00:37,567
For any detonative
devices.

1355
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:39,136
Corporal Gina,

1356
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:42,272
Are you hiding any
illicit contraband?

1357
01:00:42,272 --> 01:00:44,675
No, sir! Ma'am.

1358
01:00:44,675 --> 01:00:46,110
[Laughs]

1359
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:49,279
I think you have to be
court-martialed

1360
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:52,983
For bad, bad,
bad behavior!

1361
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:55,485
Oh, yeah. Let me pull
out my soldier.

1362

01:00:56,954 --> 01:00:57,822
Aah!

1364

Oh. Oh.

1365
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:00,357
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1366
01:01:00,357 --> 01:01:01,625
No other male soldiers
in this, all right?

1367
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:03,027
Don't ask. Don't tell.

1368
01:01:03,027 --> 01:01:05,295
God damn it, Doug, I'm
cutting off your credit.

1369
01:01:05,295 --> 01:01:07,197
Buck.

1370
01:01:07,197 --> 01:01:08,198
Hi, sir.

1371
01:01:08,198 --> 01:01:09,233
God damn it.

1372
01:01:09,233 --> 01:01:13,070
You owe me $7,000 worth
of Jack-off time.

1373
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:15,973
I'm not gonna extend
no more credit to you, boy.

1374
01:01:15,973 --> 01:01:17,975
Buck, I'm good for it.

1375
01:01:17,975 --> 01:01:19,376
Oh, I know you are.

1376
01:01:19,376 --> 01:01:23,180
In fact, I got a little
proposition for you.

1377
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,082
Lexa, Gina...

1378
01:01:25,082 --> 01:01:26,583
[Laughs]

1379
01:01:26,583 --> 01:01:27,584
Get on out of here.

1380
01:01:27,584 --> 01:01:29,386
Aw!

1381
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:32,823
Bye, Dougie.

1382
01:01:34,658 --> 01:01:36,693
I've seen your website.

1383
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:39,329
I know what you're doing.

1384
01:01:39,329 --> 01:01:41,631
The one thing I don't
understand, though,

1385
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:46,470
Is you work
for www.Pornderosa.Cum.

1386
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:49,874
And your deal memo stipulates
that anything you do

1387
01:01:49,874 --> 01:01:53,110
In terms of content producing

1388
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:56,446
Belongs to me
along with all assets.

1389
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:57,681
What?

1390
01:01:57,681 --> 01:02:01,251
Yep. I want a piece
of the action.

1391
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:04,354
Doug, I'm willing
to let all this slide

1392
01:02:04,354 --> 01:02:08,258
If you just partner with me
on a little side project.

1393
01:02:08,258 --> 01:02:09,860
I'm listening.

1394
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:14,799
I wanna do a live,
pay-per-view, Internet fuck fest

1395

With that young virgin, Ross.

$1 million.

1398
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:24,641
Buck, I don't know
if he will.

1399
01:02:24,641 --> 01:02:25,876
He's a pussy.

1400
01:02:25,876 --> 01:02:27,544
He's scared
to fuck on camera.

1401
01:02:27,544 --> 01:02:29,780
Every single one
of your movies

1402
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:33,918
Has over 25 million views.

1403
01:02:33,918 --> 01:02:38,388
If we can get that young,
sweet, virgin boy

1404
01:02:38,388 --> 01:02:44,028
To pop his cherry and sell
the live stream for $5.00 a pop,

1405
01:02:44,028 --> 01:02:47,097
That's
a whole bunch of clams.

1406
01:02:47,097 --> 01:02:48,498
I think
you can do the math.

1407
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:51,368
Okay, buck, let me
get back to you on that.

1408
01:02:51,368 --> 01:02:53,503
Oh, and, buck?

1409
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:55,806
Can you please put
lexa and Gina back on?

1410
01:02:55,806 --> 01:02:56,807
I mean I've
already gotten started.

1411
01:02:56,807 --> 01:02:58,608
I gotta finish up.

1412
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:01,311
You fucking pervert!

1413
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:04,714
Thanks, buck.

1414
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:06,817

were we, ladies?

the problem, ed.

Come on, man.

what you were doing.

Yeah, but I wanted to explain
it to her myself, man,

01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:39,416
When the time was right.

1427

to tell your girlfriend

1428
01:03:42,052 --> 01:03:43,153
That you're
making porn videos

1429
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:44,721
To pay off a psychopath?

1430
01:03:44,721 --> 01:03:48,859
You mean tell her that you
are making porn videos.

1431
01:03:48,859 --> 01:03:50,327
Look I may be the star,

1432
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:51,962
But we're in this
together, brother.

1433
01:03:51,962 --> 01:03:55,432
No. No, you dragged me
into this shit.

1434
01:03:55,432 --> 01:03:57,834
Now she's gone.

1435
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:00,504
Maybe
that's a good thing.

1436
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:02,839
What?

1437
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:06,610
Look, Kim's a nice girl.
Too nice.

1438
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:10,247
She's held your cock
hostage for four years.

1439
01:04:10,247 --> 01:04:11,916
Maybe secretly you
wanted to get caught.

1440
01:04:11,916 --> 01:04:13,117
Now you're free.

1441
01:04:13,117 --> 01:04:14,751
Being free sucks.

1442
01:04:14,751 --> 01:04:16,586
You just gotta
give it a try.

1443
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:19,456
No. I want her back.

1444
01:04:19,456 --> 01:04:21,358
You're too much
of a goddamn pussy!

1445
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:23,293
I give up.
It's too much work.

1446
01:04:23,293 --> 01:04:27,197
You ever stop to think if I
wanted your help, ed? Huh?

1447
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:31,068
You ever think that maybe some
of us are happy the way we are?

1448
01:04:31,068 --> 01:04:32,937
Some of us don't have
to go around showing off

1449
01:04:32,937 --> 01:04:34,371
Every single second
of our lives,

1450
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:36,240
'Cause we don't
actually hate ourselves.

1451
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,742
Fuck you.
You're jealous.

1452
01:04:38,742 --> 01:04:40,177
Jealous of what, ed?

1453
01:04:40,177 --> 01:04:42,879
Jealous of you fucking
drunk sleazebags

1454
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,714
And chicks who
are borderline retarded?

1455
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:46,783
Yes! Exactly.

1456
01:04:46,783 --> 01:04:48,352
God, dude, look at you.

1457
01:04:48,352 --> 01:04:50,354
I don't even know who
you are anymore, asshole.

1458
01:04:50,354 --> 01:04:52,722
Who are you calling
asshole, cock?

1459
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,624
[Both whining]

1460
01:04:57,394 --> 01:04:58,562
[Squealing]

1461
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:00,797
Unh!
Ow!

1462
01:05:00,797 --> 01:05:02,732
Oh! Aah! Aah!

1463
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,068
Ow! You're a whore!

1464
01:05:04,068 --> 01:05:05,635
Aah! Unh!

1465
01:05:07,371 --> 01:05:08,372
Jerk!

1466
01:05:17,948 --> 01:05:19,449
I'm sorry.

1467
01:05:19,449 --> 01:05:21,218
All right, brother.

1468
01:05:21,218 --> 01:05:22,752
Let's see how well
you do without me.

1469
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,188
Fuck you!

1470
01:05:24,188 --> 01:05:27,591
I'm done with all of you
for real this time!

1471
01:05:30,794 --> 01:05:32,796
What is the problem?

1472
01:05:32,796 --> 01:05:35,165
Oh, Ed's out for good.

1473
01:05:35,165 --> 01:05:37,901
So, yeah, we pretty much
have to come up

1474
01:05:37,901 --> 01:05:40,070
With the rest
of the cash on our own.

1475
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:41,938
What are we short?

1476
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:45,342
We need to generate $98,000
in the next four days.

1477
01:05:45,342 --> 01:05:47,144
So according
to my calculations,

1478
01:05:47,144 --> 01:05:49,213
We need to
make two more movies,

1479
01:05:49,213 --> 01:05:50,847
And that should
put us over the mark.

1480
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,182
Okay, okay.

1481
01:05:52,182 --> 01:05:53,950
Uh, well, you're gonna
have to do it, Marcus.

1482
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,152
'Cause kwan's...

1483
01:05:55,152 --> 01:05:56,686
I respectfully decline.

1484
01:05:56,686 --> 01:05:59,256
I did my part, and I'm
traumatized for life.

1485
01:05:59,256 --> 01:06:00,824
Trying to get the taste
of female ejaculate

1486
01:06:00,824 --> 01:06:02,359
Out of your mouth

1487
01:06:02,359 --> 01:06:04,028
Is like trying to get
skunk spray off clothing.

1488
01:06:04,028 --> 01:06:05,029
Brush it off, man.
Doesn't matter.

1489
01:06:05,029 --> 01:06:06,263
You're the only one.

1490
01:06:06,263 --> 01:06:07,897
Frankly, I believe
ed has a point.

1491
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:09,933
You're the only qualified
person yet to contribute,

1492
01:06:09,933 --> 01:06:12,502
And now you're single.

1493
01:06:12,502 --> 01:06:14,438
And factoring in
your virginity,

1494
01:06:14,438 --> 01:06:16,606
Which increases
the coefficient by 4.2.

1495
01:06:16,606 --> 01:06:19,143
And if we carry over the 8,
then that's... whoa.

1496
01:06:19,143 --> 01:06:21,011
What does it say?
What does it mean?

1497
01:06:21,011 --> 01:06:22,212
According
to my calculations,

1498
01:06:22,212 --> 01:06:23,513
I believe that
if you were to perform,

1499
01:06:23,513 --> 01:06:25,582
We will only
need to make one movie.

1500
01:06:25,582 --> 01:06:27,317
That's impossible.

1501
01:06:28,618 --> 01:06:29,919
Oh! What about Doug?

1502
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:31,155
Yeah, tell kwan to get

1503
01:06:31,155 --> 01:06:32,489
Our next starlet
on the phone.

1504
01:06:48,272 --> 01:06:49,706
Hey, wake up.
[Slap]

1505
01:06:49,706 --> 01:06:50,807
Ow. What...

1506
01:06:50,807 --> 01:06:52,276
Doug, you're up.
What?

1507
01:06:52,276 --> 01:06:53,843
You're up, man.
It's your turn to make a video.

1508
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,745
We've got Anna Williams
for you.

1509
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:57,214
Who?

1510
01:06:57,214 --> 01:06:59,249
Uh, that chick that fell
down a well 20 years ago.

1511
01:06:59,249 --> 01:07:00,250
You have
to have sex with her.

1512
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:01,685
Me?
Yeah.

1513
01:07:01,685 --> 01:07:05,422
Oh, no. I'm, uh...
I'm all tapped out.

1514
01:07:05,422 --> 01:07:06,656
Dude, what?

1515
01:07:06,656 --> 01:07:07,857
No, you've been waiting
for this forever.

1516
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,126
Come on, get up.

1517
01:07:09,126 --> 01:07:10,527
You've gotta
give me a warning,

1518
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:11,961
Or I'm gonna take
care of myself first.

1519
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:13,830
Besides, it's 3:00
in the afternoon.

1520
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:15,232
Just get ed to do it.

1521
01:07:15,232 --> 01:07:16,566
I'll take care
of the next one.

1522
01:07:16,566 --> 01:07:17,801
Ed's not available.

1523
01:07:17,801 --> 01:07:19,736
Okay, you do it.

1524
01:07:19,736 --> 01:07:21,405
No.

1525
01:07:21,405 --> 01:07:22,206
[Sighs]

1526
01:07:22,206 --> 01:07:23,473
Okay, fine.

1527
01:07:23,473 --> 01:07:25,375
Oh, I got it.
Perfect.

1528
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:26,776
Couple of these
will do the trick.

1529
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:27,844
Pop 'em quick.

1530
01:07:27,844 --> 01:07:28,845
Hey, whoa, whoa.

1531
01:07:28,845 --> 01:07:29,979
Isn't one enough of those?

1532
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:31,415
Better safe than sorry.
Mmm!

1533
01:07:31,415 --> 01:07:33,850
I wonder how long it takes
for these things to kick in.

1534
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:34,951
Oh!

1535
01:07:34,951 --> 01:07:36,453
All right, whatever.
Let's go.

1536
01:07:36,453 --> 01:07:38,155
All right.
Come on. Come on.

1537
01:07:38,155 --> 01:07:39,423
Oh!

1538
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,360
I don't feel
too good, man.

1539
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,129
My heart is
beating really fast.

1540
01:07:45,129 --> 01:07:46,363
You'll be fine.

1541
01:07:46,363 --> 01:07:47,731
The side effects
include diarrhea,

1542
01:07:47,731 --> 01:07:49,233
Flushing of the face,
heart palpitations,

1543
01:07:49,233 --> 01:07:50,600
Stroke and coma.

1544
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,901
Like I said,
you'll be fine.

1545
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,470
Go get her.

1546
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:56,406
Go for it.
Hey, come on over here.

1547
01:07:57,774 --> 01:07:59,976
Hi.
Hi.

1548
01:07:59,976 --> 01:08:01,578
Whoo!

1549
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:03,247
[Groaning]

1550
01:08:04,848 --> 01:08:06,583
Mmm!

1551
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:08,485
[Laughing]

1552
01:08:08,485 --> 01:08:09,919
Whoo!

1553
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:13,490
[Laughing and coughing]

1554
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:16,826
You okay?

1555
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:17,994
I'm... I'm good.

1556
01:08:17,994 --> 01:08:21,198
Ahh.
Okay, good.

1557
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:23,667
[Coughing]

1558
01:08:23,667 --> 01:08:24,934
You just relax.

1559
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:26,002
Okay.

1560
01:08:26,002 --> 01:08:27,671
Yeah?
Yeah.

1561
01:08:27,671 --> 01:08:28,738
Mmm!

1562
01:08:28,738 --> 01:08:31,275
Ooh! Do
you like what you see?

1563
01:08:31,275 --> 01:08:33,143
Ooh, yeah. Spank me.

1564
01:08:33,143 --> 01:08:34,411
Yeah.

1565
01:08:37,381 --> 01:08:39,583
What am
I supposed to do now?

1566
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:42,018
Shit! Doug.

1567
01:08:42,018 --> 01:08:43,153
Doug, wake up.

1568
01:08:43,153 --> 01:08:44,888
Don't clap. Don't clap.

1569
01:08:44,888 --> 01:08:46,656
He's still functioning.
He's good. He's just passed out.

1570
01:08:46,656 --> 01:08:48,325
It says
we only have to worry

1571
01:08:48,325 --> 01:08:49,759
If his erection lasts
more than four hours.

1572
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:52,996
Eww. Are you
sure he's not dead?

1573
01:08:52,996 --> 01:08:54,798
No, keep going.

1574
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:56,766
Okay. Okay.

1575
01:08:56,766 --> 01:08:58,968
Should
I take his pants off?

1576
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:00,270
Yeah, sure.
Take 'em down.

1577
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:02,772
Get comfortable.

1578
01:09:02,772 --> 01:09:03,907
Come on, big boy.

1579
01:09:03,907 --> 01:09:05,209
Ooh!

1580
01:09:05,209 --> 01:09:11,715
All right. Looks
like we are uploaded.

1581
01:09:11,715 --> 01:09:12,982
[Woman moaning]

1582
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,684
Fuck!
I can't believe it.

1583
01:09:14,684 --> 01:09:16,320
Why do I
always miss everything?

1584
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:17,787
I can't believe you
let this woman fuck me

1585
01:09:17,787 --> 01:09:18,788
While I was in a coma.

1586
01:09:18,788 --> 01:09:20,890
Yeah, she's
going pretty wild here.

1587
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:23,760
Ooh! Ooh, you like that?

1588
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:24,994
You like that?

1589
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:28,698
That might as well have been
a rock she was humping.

1590
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:31,235
You didn't feel anything?
Anything at all?

1591
01:09:31,235 --> 01:09:33,637
No! God damn it!

1592
01:09:33,637 --> 01:09:35,205
Ohh!

1593
01:09:35,205 --> 01:09:36,573
Ooh!

1594
01:09:36,573 --> 01:09:38,908
I'm the first virgin
that's not a virgin.

1595
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:40,043
Stop it.

1596
01:09:40,043 --> 01:09:41,645
It's true.

1597
01:09:41,645 --> 01:09:43,146
Now I know
what parents feel like

1598
01:09:43,146 --> 01:09:44,748
When they adopt kids.

1599
01:09:50,587 --> 01:09:53,423
Well, we're up to
3 million hits already

1600
01:09:53,423 --> 01:09:55,058
With Douglas's video.

1601
01:09:55,058 --> 01:09:56,593
It's good,
but not good enough.

1602
01:10:01,298 --> 01:10:02,499
Yeah, asshole.

1603
01:10:02,499 --> 01:10:03,733
Hey, at least
I got to have sex,

1604
01:10:03,733 --> 01:10:05,235
Even though
I don't remember.

1605
01:10:05,235 --> 01:10:06,570
You just got a face full.

1606

We're totally fucked, guys.
We have no star.

1607
01:10:09,473 --> 01:10:10,674
I hate to say it,

1608
01:10:10,674 --> 01:10:12,542
But no one
can do it like ed.

1609
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:15,479
We have three days
to come up with 80 grand

1610
01:10:15,479 --> 01:10:17,046
Or else
we go to prison,

1611
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,782
Which means
we're fucked.

African-American men are
12 times more likely to die

1615
01:10:25,989 --> 01:10:27,957
There is one way.

1616

a cross-promotion with us.

1619
01:10:35,164 --> 01:10:36,165

fucking say something?

1620

Will they pay us?

1621
01:10:37,367 --> 01:10:38,435
Yeah.

1626
01:10:50,146 --> 01:10:51,848
But I knew he was
too much of a pussy to do it,

1627
01:10:51,848 --> 01:10:53,750
So that's
why I didn't say nothin'.

1628
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,919
Yeah, I mean...

1629
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:57,587
Well...

1630
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:01,825
Say we're
sorry to who, Danny?

1631
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:05,895
Actually, yeah.

1632
01:11:05,895 --> 01:11:07,397
Yeah. Why don't
we just find her house,

1633
01:11:07,397 --> 01:11:08,832
And I'll beg for
forgiveness? I mean...

1634
01:11:08,832 --> 01:11:10,567

Under a mix of narcotics
and alcohol.

1638
01:11:15,339 --> 01:11:16,873
I've got a better idea.

1639
01:11:16,873 --> 01:11:18,875
You guys stay here.
I'll apologize for us.

1640
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:21,711
But just in case, uh...

1641
01:11:23,079 --> 01:11:25,549
Tell porndarosa yes.

1642
01:11:25,549 --> 01:11:27,384
What? Really?

1643
01:11:27,384 --> 01:11:29,285
It's our plan "b."

1644
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:30,687
Danny's second option.

1645

If Melanie doesn't
drop the charges, then...

1646
01:11:34,524 --> 01:11:37,327
Call porndarosa
and tell them to set it up.

Then call her manager
and make an appointment.

1653
01:12:01,851 --> 01:12:03,186

It's important.

01:17:35,018 --> 01:17:36,920
Okay, you got this.
You got this.

1778
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,187
We're gonna witness

1779
01:17:38,187 --> 01:17:40,456
America's favorite virgin,
Ross ganz,

1780
01:17:40,456 --> 01:17:44,327
Pop his cherry tonight
live on videotape!

1781
01:17:44,327 --> 01:17:47,530
[Chanting] I chi ooh LA
goo chi koopah!

1782
01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:48,932
What the hell
did he just say?

1783
01:17:48,932 --> 01:17:52,368
I don't, um...
Do you have to go potty?

1784
01:17:52,368 --> 01:17:53,536
I don't know.

1785
01:17:53,536 --> 01:17:55,872
Jeez.

1786
01:17:55,872 --> 01:17:58,207
Well, here he is... Ross.

1787
01:17:58,207 --> 01:17:59,675
Come here, boy.

1788
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,010
Hey.

1789
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:04,613
So let me get
this straight, partner.

1790
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:07,550
You're a virgin?

1791
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:09,252
Uh, yes. Yeah.

1792
01:18:09,252 --> 01:18:11,888
[Laughing] A virgin!

1793
01:18:11,888 --> 01:18:14,958
Whoo! Well, we're
pretty fucking classy

1794
01:18:14,958 --> 01:18:17,426
Here at porndarosa. Cum,

1795
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:19,162
So what
we did is went out

1796
01:18:19,162 --> 01:18:20,663
And got
you an extra special

1797
01:18:20,663 --> 01:18:22,365
Little hussy to bang.

1798
01:18:22,365 --> 01:18:25,634
Are you ready to meet
your lucky starlet, stud?

1799
01:18:25,634 --> 01:18:27,303
Let's just
get this over with, man.

1800
01:18:27,303 --> 01:18:28,471
Right.

1801
01:18:28,471 --> 01:18:32,108
Well, you know
her from the magazines.

1802
01:18:32,108 --> 01:18:36,880
Let's all please welcome
miss Emily Addison!

1803
01:18:38,181 --> 01:18:39,248
Holy shit.

1804
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:47,423
Hey, Ross.
I'm a big fan of yours.

1805
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:54,397
Ohh!

1806
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:58,567
Saddle up, cowboy!

1807
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:03,306
Time for some fuckin'!
Yee-haw!

1808
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:08,812
Whoa.

1809
01:19:10,413 --> 01:19:11,948
Uh...

1810
01:19:14,617 --> 01:19:16,352
Whoa.

1811
01:19:17,353 --> 01:19:19,088
Uh...

1812
01:19:33,302 --> 01:19:34,838
[Whimpers]

1813
01:19:53,056 --> 01:19:55,124
Wait, wait, wait.
Aah!

1814
01:19:58,261 --> 01:19:59,829
Wait.

1815
01:20:04,667 --> 01:20:05,801
What?

1816
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,803
You don't like me?

1817
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:09,505
Yes. Yes, I do.

1818
01:20:09,505 --> 01:20:11,174
I just...
Holy shit, I do.

1819
01:20:11,174 --> 01:20:13,642
I just...
I-i-i don't know.

1820
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:15,178
Get to it, kid!

1821
01:20:15,178 --> 01:20:16,812
You're gettin'
paid to fuck!

1822
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,681
Shut up!

1823
01:20:18,681 --> 01:20:19,883
Fuck this!

1824
01:20:19,883 --> 01:20:21,284
My God, this is insane.
I can't.

1825
01:20:21,284 --> 01:20:23,887
I can't do this. I can't.

1826
01:20:23,887 --> 01:20:26,355
I... i... I can't
believe these words

1827
01:20:26,355 --> 01:20:28,357
Are actually coming
out of my mouth,

1828
01:20:28,357 --> 01:20:30,426
Considering I've probably
masturbated to you

1829
01:20:30,426 --> 01:20:32,295
Over 1,000 times.

1830
01:20:33,897 --> 01:20:35,331
I know everything about you.

1831
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:37,700
Oh, my God.
You're awesome.

1832
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:39,302
I, uh...

1833
01:20:39,302 --> 01:20:41,037
I even have
this little shrine

1834
01:20:41,037 --> 01:20:44,073
I made dedicated to you.

1835
01:20:44,073 --> 01:20:45,841
It took
some pretty huge...

1836
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:48,677
Stuff. Shut up!

1837
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:51,047
You know what?
The truth is

1838
01:20:51,047 --> 01:20:53,249
Me and my friends are
only making these tapes

1839
01:20:53,249 --> 01:20:54,417
Because we were threatened

1840
01:20:54,417 --> 01:20:56,385
By that Hollywood agent
Danny silver,

1841
01:20:56,385 --> 01:20:59,455
Who's a fucking
slimy cocksucker,

1842
01:20:59,455 --> 01:21:01,624
And I hope you're fucking
watching, motherfucker!

1843
01:21:01,624 --> 01:21:04,627
He threatened to beat us up
and have us arrested

1844
01:21:04,627 --> 01:21:08,197
And even kill us if we didn't
come up with 500 grand.

1845
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:10,733
Well, here's your 500 grand
right here, motherfucker!

1846
01:21:10,733 --> 01:21:11,935
Come and get it,
'cause I quit!

1847
01:21:12,969 --> 01:21:14,603
You can beat me up.
I don't care.

1848
01:21:14,603 --> 01:21:16,105
Whatever, man.
All right?

1849
01:21:16,105 --> 01:21:17,740
Because we are
done working for you.

1850
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:18,741
We're done!

1851
01:21:18,741 --> 01:21:20,143
You bitch!

1852
01:21:20,143 --> 01:21:22,078
And I'll have you know,

1853
01:21:22,078 --> 01:21:24,613
There's only one girl
I want to lose my virginity to.

1854
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,717
My ex-girlfriend Kim.

1855
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:31,087
And she wouldn't
be watching this,

1856
01:21:31,087 --> 01:21:33,089
Because she's
not that kind of girl.

1857
01:21:33,089 --> 01:21:34,590
Like all
you little perverts.

1858
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:36,292
She's pure,

1859
01:21:36,292 --> 01:21:39,095
And I love that about her.

1860
01:21:41,697 --> 01:21:44,033
It's all this bullshit
that caused us to break up!

1861
01:21:44,033 --> 01:21:46,035
Fucking shit!

1862
01:21:46,035 --> 01:21:47,436
Hey, kwan.

1863
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,241
Come here.
I'm not done with you.

1864
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:53,642
Look, I know
you're watching, ed.

1865
01:21:53,642 --> 01:21:55,144
All right?

1866
01:21:55,144 --> 01:21:57,580
I just want to let you know
you're not a frat guy.

1867
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:59,915
Come on, you're
a ninth level paladin

1868
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:02,351
That's led the clan
on countless adventures.

1869
01:22:02,351 --> 01:22:03,552
Come on, dude.

1870
01:22:03,552 --> 01:22:06,055
If I had a fucking dollar
for every time you talked

1871
01:22:06,055 --> 01:22:08,591
About how much Delaney
was a cocksucker,

1872
01:22:08,591 --> 01:22:11,660
Man, I'd have, like,
between 84 and 130 dollars.

1873
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,596
Hey, brah. I might've
said one or two things.

1874
01:22:13,596 --> 01:22:16,332
Seriously. Delaney
doesn't even like you, man.

1875
01:22:16,332 --> 01:22:18,334
He just hangs out with you
because you do his homework.

1876
01:22:18,334 --> 01:22:19,568
You know what, fuck this!

1877
01:22:19,568 --> 01:22:21,670
I hope you're watching, too,
Delaney.

1878
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:23,672
Because I'm gonna tell
the Dean on your punk ass!

1879
01:22:23,672 --> 01:22:25,641
Get him off the fuckin' set!

1880
01:22:25,641 --> 01:22:27,943
He's blocking the action!

1881
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:30,346
Time to take
out the garbage.

1882
01:22:30,346 --> 01:22:31,680
Recycle.

1883
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:32,815
You can sit.

1884
01:22:32,815 --> 01:22:34,083
Ed!

1885
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:35,218
[Speaking
fantasy language]

1886
01:22:35,218 --> 01:22:38,021
[Speaking fantasy language]

1887
01:22:40,089 --> 01:22:42,925
Unhand him, you ghouls,
at once!

1888
01:22:42,925 --> 01:22:45,561
Aah!

1889
01:22:45,561 --> 01:22:48,031
You guys are
killing my boner.

1890
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:51,100
Marcus, wake up.

1891
01:22:52,435 --> 01:22:55,038
Yo, what the fuck happened?

1892
01:22:55,038 --> 01:22:57,240
Got knocked out
again, buddy.

1893
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:59,675
You... you're black.

1894
01:22:59,675 --> 01:23:02,211
No shit, bitch.

1895
01:23:02,211 --> 01:23:04,847
Damn, who
the fuck served me?

1896
01:23:04,847 --> 01:23:06,849
Dude, all those blows
to your head

1897
01:23:06,849 --> 01:23:08,317
Somehow cured
your asperger's.

1898
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:10,719
Boy, you really are a pussy.

1899
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:13,556
You can't even get it up
for a million dollars.

1900
01:23:13,556 --> 01:23:14,957
You mean 100,000.

1901
01:23:14,957 --> 01:23:18,594
Doug made the deal
for a million.

1902
01:23:18,594 --> 01:23:19,728
He did?

1903
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:22,131
You motherfucker!

1904
01:23:22,131 --> 01:23:23,266
You were gonna keep
900,000 for yourself?

1905
01:23:23,266 --> 01:23:25,468
Not really. I was just...

1906
01:23:26,702 --> 01:23:27,936
Come here!

1907
01:23:27,936 --> 01:23:29,138
I gonna get you!

1908
01:23:29,138 --> 01:23:31,340
That's some shit.

1909
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:33,976
Now these motherfuckers up
in here better get ready

1910
01:23:33,976 --> 01:23:35,411
For an unholy beat-down

1911
01:23:35,411 --> 01:23:38,447
The likes of which
ain't nobody ever seen.

1912
01:23:38,447 --> 01:23:39,448
Gotcha

1913
01:23:39,448 --> 01:23:40,749
[Groans]

1914
01:23:40,749 --> 01:23:41,850
What you gonna do,
bitch?

1915
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,419
[Groans]

1916
01:23:43,419 --> 01:23:46,089
The motherfucking buck
stops here.

1917
01:23:46,089 --> 01:23:47,490
[Smash]

1918
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,494
God.

1919
01:23:51,494 --> 01:23:52,728
Whoa.

1920
01:23:54,963 --> 01:23:56,299
Hey, Danny.

1921
01:23:57,766 --> 01:23:59,001
You got a minute?

1922
01:23:59,001 --> 01:24:01,137
Can it wait?

1923
01:24:01,137 --> 01:24:02,405
Mmm...

1924
01:24:02,405 --> 01:24:03,839
I'm trying to do
some business over here.

1925
01:24:03,839 --> 01:24:05,841
Well, it's, um...

1926
01:24:05,841 --> 01:24:08,644
It's kind of important.

1927
01:24:09,912 --> 01:24:12,448
All right.
Make it quick.

1928
01:24:12,448 --> 01:24:16,419
Well, you're my manager,
and as an actor,

1929
01:24:16,419 --> 01:24:18,321
Us actors feel like
it's good to scratch

1930
01:24:18,321 --> 01:24:20,789
Our management's back
every once in while.

1931
01:24:20,789 --> 01:24:22,057
You know what I mean?

1932
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:23,992
Uh-huh.

1933
01:24:23,992 --> 01:24:25,694
And as your best client,

1934
01:24:25,694 --> 01:24:31,066
I feel like
I kind of owe it to you.

1935
01:24:33,602 --> 01:24:36,038
And you know
how I roll, baby.

1936
01:24:36,038 --> 01:24:37,906
I'm kind of kinky.

1937
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:40,276
Mellony, mellony.
Mmm.

1938
01:24:40,276 --> 01:24:42,478
What did I do
to deserve this?

1939
01:24:42,478 --> 01:24:43,279
Turn around.

1940
01:24:43,279 --> 01:24:44,580
[Both laughing]

1941
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:46,782
Turn around.
Whoa! [Laughing]

1942
01:24:51,287 --> 01:24:53,556
[Moaning]

1943
01:24:53,556 --> 01:24:55,224
Stop it.
Look at this!

1944
01:24:55,224 --> 01:24:56,759
You see that?

1945
01:24:56,759 --> 01:24:58,227
That's called
a contract, baby.

1946
01:24:58,227 --> 01:24:59,662
[Muffled shouting]

1947
01:24:59,662 --> 01:25:00,696
A contract...

1948
01:25:00,696 --> 01:25:02,097
One of those
little bitty things

1949
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:04,032
That you could never
get me, seven years.

1950
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:05,301
In seven years,

1951
01:25:05,301 --> 01:25:06,902
You couldn't get me
one of those things.

1952
01:25:06,902 --> 01:25:09,472
And I just wanted you to
look at all those zeroes

1953
01:25:09,472 --> 01:25:11,240
That are going
to be all mine.

1954
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:12,241
[Muffled] That's mine!

1955
01:25:12,241 --> 01:25:13,542
And none of yours!

1956
01:25:13,542 --> 01:25:14,643
Stop it!

[Groans]
Uh-huh.

1958
01:25:16,212 --> 01:25:17,980
Oh, and
guess what, Danny?

1959
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:20,115
You're fired. Uh-huh.

1960
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:22,050
You're fired,
and I never want to

1961
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:24,187
Ever, ever,
ever see you ever again.

1962
01:25:24,187 --> 01:25:25,788
[Shouts]
Shut up!

1963
01:25:25,788 --> 01:25:27,623
Listen to me.

1964
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:29,358
I should leave you
with a little something,

1965
01:25:29,358 --> 01:25:30,659
Though, shouldn't I?

1966
01:25:30,659 --> 01:25:32,361
I'm gonna give you
something before I leave

1967
01:25:32,361 --> 01:25:33,996
Just so you
remember me by, okay?

1968
01:25:33,996 --> 01:25:36,098
[Moans]

1969
01:25:36,098 --> 01:25:37,633
So you just stay there,

1970
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:39,468
And I'm gonna give you
something to remember me.

1971
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:41,737
It'll be real good, okay?

1972
01:25:41,737 --> 01:25:43,239
Stay down.

1973
01:25:43,239 --> 01:25:44,473
Fuck you!

1974
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:46,742
You feel that! Uh-huh!

1975
01:25:46,742 --> 01:25:49,011
Yeah, it feels good,
right, baby?

1976
01:25:49,011 --> 01:25:51,214
Yeah!

1977
01:25:55,884 --> 01:25:57,686
Sorry I'm late for raid.

1978
01:25:57,686 --> 01:25:59,688
Who said
you were welcome?

1979
01:25:59,688 --> 01:26:01,357
Yo. What up, sexy?

1980
01:26:01,357 --> 01:26:02,558
Don't call me that anymore.

1981
01:26:02,558 --> 01:26:04,092
The guys kicked me
out of the frat

1982
01:26:04,092 --> 01:26:06,495
As soon as our videos
got taken down.

1983
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:07,896
So what?

1984
01:26:07,896 --> 01:26:10,433
I figured I would bring you
this from the p.O. Box.

1985
01:26:12,835 --> 01:26:14,370
Ahem.

1986

What was I thinking
fucking that guy?"

1989
01:26:19,575 --> 01:26:20,843
Yeah, I already
know all this stuff.

1990
01:26:20,843 --> 01:26:21,844
Skip to the end.

1991

I'm sorry I betrayed
the clan, brother.

in the wrong again.
