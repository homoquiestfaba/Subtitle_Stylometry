Freaky freak.

Do I know you?

I mean, you trying to get with me?

You really don't know who I am, do you?

543
00:21:10,318 --> 00:21:11,568
I wish I did.

544
00:21:12,683 --> 00:21:16,183
About six months ago, you saved my life.

545
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:18,412
I did what?

546
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,278

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,448
Okay, you remember the
night your girlfriend

00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,795
dumped you live on the air
for the whole world to hear?

551
00:21:31,797 --> 00:21:34,467
On the radio station, you remember that?

552
00:21:34,469 --> 00:21:35,427
Yeah.

553
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:38,515
I'm the one who called

there's somethin' about you

that has me...

Just, I don't know what to
say when I'm around you.

moved in, everything changed.

1407

He just got so controlling.

1408
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:30,507
I mean, I couldn't even go to the bathroom

1409
00:55:30,509 --> 00:55:33,162
without him wanting to know where I was

1410
00:55:33,164 --> 00:55:34,914
and what I was doing.

1411
00:55:36,779 --> 00:55:39,852
I couldn't even drive
myself to work anymore.

1412
00:55:39,854 --> 00:55:42,248

Are you serious?

1414
00:55:48,502 --> 00:55:52,129

putting his hands on me.

00:55:53,357 --> 00:55:54,420

[glass shatters]

1418
00:55:56,092 --> 00:55:59,308
He was pinning me down
and grabbing me mostly.

1419
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:00,560
He used to say,

1420
00:56:02,377 --> 00:56:04,313
"It doesn't make any
sense to bruise up a peach

1421
00:56:04,315 --> 00:56:06,315
and then try to eat it."

1422
00:56:10,879 --> 00:56:13,753
You deserve so much better.

1423
00:56:13,755 --> 00:56:14,687
Yeah, I know.

1424
00:56:14,689 --> 00:56:15,522
I know.

1425
00:56:17,836 --> 00:56:19,467
But that's what I was
going through the night

1426
00:56:19,469 --> 00:56:22,552
that I called into the radio station.

1427
00:56:25,767 --> 00:56:28,934
That night I got the courage to leave.

1428
00:56:31,696 --> 00:56:36,370
And ever since that night,
I've really been able to

1429

just live my life.

maybe it's time to move on.

01:05:27,118 --> 01:05:28,763
Just you and me, baby.

1658
01:05:28,765 --> 01:05:30,015
Like old times.

1659
01:05:33,918 --> 01:05:34,835
Hurry up.

1660
01:05:35,818 --> 01:05:36,651

[Tony screams]

1663
01:05:46,658 --> 01:05:47,489
Get rid of him.

1664
01:05:47,491 --> 01:05:49,698
But make it look a suicide.

1665
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:50,533
Got it?

1666
01:05:51,495 --> 01:05:53,995
[tense music]

1667
01:05:55,178 --> 01:05:58,371
[Tony groans]

[goons muttering]

1669
01:06:05,536 --> 01:06:06,948
Yeah.

1670
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:09,288
You spend a lot of time
with your personal life

1671
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:11,561
and not our business, Hendricks.

1672
01:06:11,563 --> 01:06:12,828
[Darren] Shit.

1673
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:13,663
Damn.

1674
01:06:20,457 --> 01:06:21,538
Be cool.

1675
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:22,371
We gonna follow him.

1676
01:06:22,373 --> 01:06:23,971
[Darren] Get your big
ass hand out of my face.

1677
01:06:23,973 --> 01:06:24,804
My bad.

1678
01:06:24,806 --> 01:06:25,637
[Darren] Hey.

1679
01:06:25,639 --> 01:06:27,226
It ain't worth this no more.

1680
01:06:27,228 --> 01:06:28,059
Aw, man.

1681
01:06:28,061 --> 01:06:29,638
They got guns.

1682
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:30,968
We got guns, too.

1683
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:32,497
[Darren] I forgot.

1684
01:06:32,499 --> 01:06:33,744
Just shut up and drive.

1685
01:06:33,746 --> 01:06:36,128
[Darren] What, you wanna follow 'em now?

1686
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:38,420
Shit, let's follow 'em.

1687
01:06:38,422 --> 01:06:40,730
I ain't got time for this
man that you're talkin' about.

1688
01:06:40,732 --> 01:06:42,248
No, you work for me.

1689
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:43,496
So, you have time for
anything I have to say.

1690
01:06:43,498 --> 01:06:44,454
[dramatic music]

1691
01:06:44,456 --> 01:06:46,789
[Hendricks] Man, fuck you.

1692
01:06:49,489 --> 01:06:50,437
Where's my money?

1693
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:52,060
Look, I got your fuckin' money.

1694
01:06:52,062 --> 01:06:55,729
[speaking foreign language]

1695
01:06:58,198 --> 01:06:59,198
Very good.

1696
01:07:00,204 --> 01:07:02,954
[phone clatters]

1697
01:07:04,114 --> 01:07:05,523
Want a good time dish?

1698
01:07:05,525 --> 01:07:08,192
[loud snorting]

1699
01:07:09,898 --> 01:07:11,835
What we talkin' about?

1700
01:07:11,837 --> 01:07:13,867
He said he got my money.

1701
01:07:13,869 --> 01:07:15,702
And you believe him.

1702
01:07:16,912 --> 01:07:20,488
Only thing a man has
in this world is his word

1703
01:07:20,490 --> 01:07:22,323
and his book of deeds.

1704
01:07:23,296 --> 01:07:26,122
[tense music]

1705
01:07:26,124 --> 01:07:27,469
Oh, come on, Mellow man.

1706
01:07:27,471 --> 01:07:28,588
Come on, man.

1707
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:29,797
Nah, don't do that.

1708
01:07:29,799 --> 01:07:32,341
[groans]

1709
01:07:32,343 --> 01:07:33,929
What should I do that?

1710
01:07:33,931 --> 01:07:34,968
You want another line?

1711
01:07:34,970 --> 01:07:37,132
Look at this piece of nothin'.

1712
01:07:37,134 --> 01:07:38,646
You saw somethin' that
didn't belong to you

1713
01:07:38,648 --> 01:07:40,643
and you took it anyway.

1714
01:07:40,645 --> 01:07:43,681
And now that goes into your book of deeds.

1715
01:07:43,683 --> 01:07:45,034
[Man] No, I didn't take nothin'.

1716
01:07:45,036 --> 01:07:47,703
[man screaming]

1717
01:07:49,367 --> 01:07:51,620

[man crying]

1719
01:07:55,714 --> 01:07:57,524
Eye for an eye.

1720
01:07:57,526 --> 01:07:59,257
[man screaming]

1721
01:07:59,259 --> 01:08:01,009
Oh, he took my eye.

1722
01:08:02,124 --> 01:08:03,463
You still got one left.

1723
01:08:03,465 --> 01:08:04,988
You'll be all right.

1724
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:08,490
[man crying indistinctly]

1725
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:13,152
Yeah, that's them right there.

1726
01:08:13,154 --> 01:08:14,364
Oh, that's them.

1727
01:08:14,366 --> 01:08:16,247
Boy, I'm about to do
surgery with this one.

1728
01:08:16,249 --> 01:08:17,098
Darren, get back here.

1729
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:17,931
What?

1730
01:08:17,933 --> 01:08:18,763
What?

1731
01:08:18,765 --> 01:08:19,597
What are you doin'?

1732
01:08:19,599 --> 01:08:20,887
What are you doin'?

1733
01:08:20,889 --> 01:08:21,721
I wanna go take care of
my business for my nigga.

1734
01:08:21,723 --> 01:08:22,958
This ain't trainin' day.

1735
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,404
All right, Lanzo?

1736
01:08:24,406 --> 01:08:25,236
So, be cool.

1737
01:08:25,238 --> 01:08:26,082
All right I'm cool.

1738
01:08:26,084 --> 01:08:26,914
- All right.
- I'm cool.

1739
01:08:26,916 --> 01:08:28,432
Don't be in a rush to get out there

1740
01:08:28,434 --> 01:08:29,266
and get your ass shot.

1741
01:08:29,268 --> 01:08:30,099
I don't wanna get shot.

1742
01:08:30,101 --> 01:08:30,932
- All right?
- Okay.

1743
01:08:30,934 --> 01:08:31,765
- Now, look.
- What?

1744
01:08:31,767 --> 01:08:33,285
I'm gonna go out here

1745
01:08:33,287 --> 01:08:34,118
and then we're gonna
handle this, all right?

1746
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:34,950
All right, you go piss.

1747
01:08:34,952 --> 01:08:36,444
You sit in the car and
I want you to wait for me.

Five minutes?

1756
01:08:44,387 --> 01:08:45,217
Five seconds?

1757
01:08:45,219 --> 01:08:46,285
Five milliseconds?

1758
01:08:46,287 --> 01:08:47,118

Didn't I tell you to give me five?

1772
01:09:16,410 --> 01:09:18,735
You ain't specify.

1773

I'll follow them.

1796
01:10:10,284 --> 01:10:11,890
You guys go get the police.

1797

[Robin] I don't love you.

Yo, how y'all bring them

You said forever.

1847
01:11:28,448 --> 01:11:30,441
I don't care about anything
else in this world,

1848
01:11:30,443 --> 01:11:32,837
but you and my money.

1849

Nothin'.

1869
01:12:54,771 --> 01:12:59,079

But you threw it all away because.

1878

Because some dumbass DJ told you to.

And, on top of all that,
his girlfriend called in

1880

at the restaurant.

Good job, baby.

1913
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:07,742
The worst thing you could ever do

1914
01:15:07,744 --> 01:15:10,744
is think somebody's dumber than you.

You up in the bar and grill
tryin' to put the move

You couldn't wait for
a brother to come up.

1932
01:15:59,843 --> 01:16:02,093
You were too self-absorbed.

1933
01:16:04,545 --> 01:16:06,712
A good woman hangs around.

She does what it takes
to help her man make it.

1935

It was all about you.

1936

What you did was heartless.

No, he just.

1966

He's not lookin' good.

1967

Can we go in?

1968
01:17:36,237 --> 01:17:37,154
We can't.

01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:38,933
Sit down.

[Doctor] It's too early
to say at this moment.

1977
01:18:03,284 --> 01:18:06,201
It's more touch and go, I'm afraid.

1978
01:18:07,802 --> 01:18:08,898
Yeah.

1979

Can I speak to you in private?

1984
01:18:29,043 --> 01:18:33,710
If you feel that way, then
maybe it's time to move on.

01:27:32,073 --> 01:27:34,740
I humbly am so happy to be back.

2204
01:27:36,091 --> 01:27:38,158
And I wanna hear from my callers.

2205
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:40,083
I wanna hear from my people.

2206
01:27:40,085 --> 01:27:40,918
Atlanta.

2207
01:27:42,312 --> 01:27:44,493
You're on the air with Tony Sinclair.

2208
01:27:44,495 --> 01:27:45,517
What's on your mind?

2209
01:27:45,519 --> 01:27:47,188
[Carmen] Hi, Tony.

2210
01:27:47,190 --> 01:27:48,919
Hey, how you doin'?

2211
01:27:48,921 --> 01:27:50,321
[Carmen] This is Carmen.

2212
01:27:50,323 --> 01:27:52,092
I wanna let you know we missed you

2213
01:27:52,094 --> 01:27:54,367
and so glad to have you back.

2214
01:27:54,369 --> 01:27:57,126
It is so good to be back.

2215
01:27:57,128 --> 01:27:58,210
[Taurus] What's goin' on, brother?

2216
01:27:58,212 --> 01:27:59,222
It's DJ Taurus.

2217
01:27:59,224 --> 01:28:00,055
Hey, brother.

2218
01:28:00,057 --> 01:28:01,266
Good to hear from you.

2219
01:28:01,268 --> 01:28:02,418
[Taurus] Man, we thought we lost you.

2220
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:03,251
Man.

2221
01:28:03,253 --> 01:28:04,644
I'm glad we didn't lose you, brother.

2222
01:28:04,646 --> 01:28:05,542
Welcome back.

2223
01:28:05,544 --> 01:28:06,375
Thanks, brother.

2224
01:28:06,377 --> 01:28:08,252
I appreciate that.

2225
01:28:08,254 --> 01:28:09,335
Next caller.

2226
01:28:09,337 --> 01:28:11,555
[Marcus] Hey, Tony, this is Marcus.

2227
01:28:11,557 --> 01:28:12,694
Hey, Marcus.

2228
01:28:12,696 --> 01:28:14,570
[Marcus] I just want
you to give a shout out

2229
01:28:14,572 --> 01:28:17,413
to all my friends in town for
the black gay pride weekend.

2230
01:28:17,415 --> 01:28:19,335
[Tony] That's what's up.

2231
01:28:19,337 --> 01:28:20,703
Next caller.

2232
01:28:20,705 --> 01:28:22,305
[Robin] Hi, Tony.

2233
01:28:22,307 --> 01:28:25,253
I'm so glad you're feeling better.

2234
01:28:25,255 --> 01:28:26,880
Oh, thank you, thank you.

2235
01:28:26,882 --> 01:28:29,328
[Robin] I wanna ask your advice.

2236
01:28:29,330 --> 01:28:30,225
Go ahead.

2237
01:28:30,227 --> 01:28:32,026
What should a woman
do when she's messed up

2238
01:28:32,028 --> 01:28:34,780
getting to know the best
man she's ever known

2239
01:28:34,782 --> 01:28:36,043
in her life?

2240
01:28:36,045 --> 01:28:37,123
[Tony] I don't know.

2241
01:28:37,125 --> 01:28:38,021
What do you mean?

2242
01:28:38,023 --> 01:28:41,025
I mean, what if she put
not only herself into danger,

2243
01:28:41,027 --> 01:28:43,110
but, him and his friends?

2244
01:28:50,344 --> 01:28:53,677
Why does your voice sound so familiar?

2245
01:28:54,582 --> 01:28:55,664
It should.

2246
01:28:55,666 --> 01:28:57,639
When I heard your voice on the radio,

2247
01:28:57,641 --> 01:28:59,474
I just had to call in.

2248
01:29:00,525 --> 01:29:02,485
Look, I was wrong for how I did things

2249
01:29:02,487 --> 01:29:03,493
and what I did to you.

2250
01:29:03,495 --> 01:29:05,730
I should have never got you
caught up in a situation

2251
01:29:05,732 --> 01:29:06,563
like that.

2252
01:29:06,565 --> 01:29:08,297
It could've cost you and
your friends your life.

2253
01:29:08,299 --> 01:29:09,466
I am so sorry.

2254
01:29:12,077 --> 01:29:14,450
I just want another chance.

2255
01:29:14,452 --> 01:29:19,216
No one has ever treated me as
good as you treated me, Tony.

2256
01:29:19,218 --> 01:29:21,200
[Tony] I don't know.

2257
01:29:21,202 --> 01:29:22,947
[Robin] Tony, I'm sorry.

2258
01:29:22,949 --> 01:29:23,782
I'm sorry.

2259
01:29:30,723 --> 01:29:31,973
I don't know.

2260
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:35,112
I just don't know.

2261
01:29:35,114 --> 01:29:37,669
[door clatters]

2262
01:29:37,671 --> 01:29:39,708
[heels clicking]

2263
01:29:39,710 --> 01:29:41,883
[door creaking]

2264
01:29:41,885 --> 01:29:44,802
If you can tell me no to my face,

2265
01:29:45,721 --> 01:29:48,544
I will never bother you again.

2266
01:29:48,546 --> 01:29:49,624
Go.

2267
01:29:49,626 --> 01:29:50,459
Go.

2268
01:30:02,422 --> 01:30:03,255
Robin.

2269
01:30:04,308 --> 01:30:06,725
[soft music]

2270
01:30:24,737 --> 01:30:27,737
[Darren sputtering]

2271
01:30:29,416 --> 01:30:30,250
Oh.

2272
01:30:33,777 --> 01:30:36,360
Oh. [laughs]

2273
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:39,473
Uh.

2274
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:42,563
Hey, Atlanta.

2275
01:30:45,464 --> 01:30:47,026
I don't know what to say.

2276
01:30:47,028 --> 01:30:49,726
[Robin laughs]

2277
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:53,119
I was not expectin' a comeback like this.

2278
01:30:53,121 --> 01:30:57,038
The woman that got this
all started a while ago

2279
01:30:58,607 --> 01:31:01,523
and has my heart pumpin' every day,

2280
01:31:02,779 --> 01:31:05,362
is here in the station with me.

2281
01:31:06,742 --> 01:31:09,913
I just don't know what to say.

2282
01:31:09,915 --> 01:31:11,748
Shut up and kiss me.

2283
01:31:13,014 --> 01:31:15,264
[chuckles]

2284
01:31:18,478 --> 01:31:20,362
Go get it, boy.

2285
01:31:20,364 --> 01:31:23,614
I ain't about to sit your kids, though.

2286
01:31:28,911 --> 01:31:31,827
[upbeat pop music]

2287
01:31:38,225 --> 01:31:40,732
Oo, this is gonna be good.

2288
01:31:40,734 --> 01:31:42,151
What's up, pop?

2289
01:31:43,156 --> 01:31:44,423
I didn't know you was here.

2290
01:31:44,425 --> 01:31:45,425
What's up?

2291
01:31:47,174 --> 01:31:49,757
Nigger, that's gonna be good.

2292
01:31:51,081 --> 01:31:52,259
You happy, son?

2293
01:31:52,261 --> 01:31:53,610
Yeah.

2294
01:31:53,612 --> 01:31:54,966
I'm proud of you.

2295
01:31:54,968 --> 01:31:56,135
Thanks, pop.

2296
01:31:57,341 --> 01:31:59,860
I still need some gas money, though.

2297
01:31:59,862 --> 01:32:00,976
You know what?

2298
01:32:00,978 --> 01:32:01,812
I got you.

2299
01:32:02,657 --> 01:32:03,732
Come on.

2300
01:32:03,734 --> 01:32:04,567
What?

2301
01:32:05,663 --> 01:32:07,615
Just come on.

2302
01:32:07,617 --> 01:32:09,034
Watch my grill.

2303
01:32:16,834 --> 01:32:18,166
Is food ready?

2304
01:32:21,889 --> 01:32:22,889
Is it ready?

2305
01:32:27,832 --> 01:32:29,023
That's not done yet.

2306
01:32:29,025 --> 01:32:30,108
Try that one.

2307
01:32:34,237 --> 01:32:35,237
All right.

2308

[car horn beeps]

2309
01:32:47,302 --> 01:32:48,850
You did good, boy.

2310
01:32:48,852 --> 01:32:50,170
I love it, man.

2311
01:32:50,172 --> 01:32:51,172
That's nice.

2312
01:32:53,218 --> 01:32:54,428
It's for you.

2313
01:32:54,430 --> 01:32:55,809
Man, quit playin'.

2314
01:32:55,811 --> 01:32:57,007
You bought me a car?

2315
01:32:57,009 --> 01:32:58,164
It's yours.

2316
01:32:58,166 --> 01:32:59,203
You bought me a car?

2317
01:32:59,205 --> 01:33:00,237
Oh man.

2318
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:01,906
You bought me a car.

2319
01:33:07,246 --> 01:33:09,917
Okay, you gonna need to bounce.

2320
01:33:09,919 --> 01:33:11,002
Yes, ma'am.

2321
01:33:15,618 --> 01:33:17,618
You really are my son.

2322
01:33:19,313 --> 01:33:21,082
Marcia, the boy bought me a car.

2323
01:33:21,084 --> 01:33:21,914
Come see.

2324
01:33:21,916 --> 01:33:22,748
Come see.

2325
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:24,750
The boy bought us a car.
