1
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,206
<i>Behold.</i>

2
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:41,542
<i>Before you are the most
popular students</i>

3
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,544
<i>At ashley high school.</i>

4
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,463
<i>In a world governed by
the laws of teenage physics,</i>

5
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:49,216
<i>These girls are
the gravitational force</i>

6
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:52,177
<i>All else revolves-
around which</i>

7
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,346
<i>Royalty, if you will.</i>

8
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:58,183
<i>With an iron fashion sense.
And they rule their kingdom</i>

9
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,352
<i>But if you think the royal
treatment is all they seek,</i>

10
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,187
<i>Don't be fooled.</i>

11
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,190
<i>A queen isn't really a queen
until she gets...</i>

12
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,483
Her crown.

13
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:08,527
<i>It's prom. Prom.</i>

14
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,154
You need a date, or
it's a reflection on me.

15
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,198
Not just anybody.
A-list. A-list.

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,325
Two varsity letters are better. Two.

17
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,369
Okay, okay.

18
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,330
A-list, two letters.
Got it.

19
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,165
Good.

20
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,139
<i>And these poor dears</i>

21
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,600
<i>Are ashley high school's
least popular students.</i>

22
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,602
<i>Isolated from
the mainstream,</i>

23
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,271
<i>Our outcasts retreat
each afternoon</i>

24
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,231
<i>To a dank garage,</i>

25
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,233
<i>Making little piggy movies</i>

26
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,568
<i>That other outcasts
will watch</i>

27
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,486
<i>From their own dreary rooms.</i>

28
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,155
The pig still
looks tense.

29
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:54,406
It can't be tense
for this shot.

30
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,202
Relax, pig.

31
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,126
Clear.

32
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,174
Cut, cut, cut,.

33
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,467
I'm not feeling
the drama.

34
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:16,220
We gotta go bigger,
much bigger.

35
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:22,351
<i>Rarely do these two groups</i>

36
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,353
<i>And that's really
for the best.</i>

37
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,563
I don't want any ninth- or
tenth-grade votes screwing this up.

38
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,315
Absolutely.
We'll round them up.

39
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,525
Round them up.

40
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,276
You're going
to be prom queen.

41
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,444
God, amber,
what do you want?

42
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,363
Every vote
in the whole school?

43
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,368
Yes.

44
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:44,414
Remember that sad sickly
boy who died last year?

45
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,375
I want his vote.
Is anybody unclear?

46
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,168
Because I think
it's pretty simple.

47
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,294
So clear.
Like crystal.

48
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,462
Good.

49
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,422
oink, oink. Snore.

50
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,428
And go.

51
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,350
And music.

52
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:10,107
Crazy pig turns up
the volume.

53
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,405
Crazy pig goes overboard.

54
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,287
Pigs are exploding,
and I'm getting nothing.

55
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,372
It's just empty noise.

56
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:26,498
Maybe lisa should
speed it up a little bit.

57
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,333
I have an idea.

58
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:51,356
Yes! Finally!

59
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,526
Another artist to help carry the load.

60
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:55,569
Great, lisa.

61
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:57,321
Good.
No one's in here.

62
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,322
Excuse me.

63
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,532
Forgive us

64
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,577
Amber pollock
needs this room

65
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:04,578
<i>Important
strategy meeting.</i>

66
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,413
Now, get out.

67
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:09,291
Hey. You don't
own this school.

68
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,335
Watch out, girls.
The elf bites.

69
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,423
Yeah, she's right.
You can't do this.

70
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:19,218
It-it's not...

71
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:20,385
Well, it's just not-

72
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,471
What's the matter?
Piggy got your tongue?

73
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:25,349
No, carlita. More like
having no life got her tongue.

74
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:27,518
Go.

75
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,187
<i>As you can see,</i>

76
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,397
<i>When populars
and unpopulars collide,</i>

77
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,191
<i>It's not pretty.</i>

78
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:36,485
<i>Nevertheless,
it's sometimes inevitable-</i>

79
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:38,403
<i>Fate, as it were.</i>

80
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,364
<i>But I'm getting
ahead of myself.</i>

81
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,491
<i>Easy to do when
you're omniscient.</i>

82
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,368
<i>So, I'll just let
our tale unfold</i>

83
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,370
<i>And say no more.</i>

84
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,497
<i>Not another word.</i>

85
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,582
<i>Absolutely finished now.</i>

86
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:07,432
Mom?

87
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,434
Can you come up here?

88
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,270
Mom's on the phone.

89
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,439
Tell her I want her
to see my dress.

90
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,441
Mom, she wants you
to see her dress!

91
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:20,445
I'm working!
For god's sake.

92
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,575
I think you look
pretty, amber.

93
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,535
Whatever.

94
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:28,370
Look, we can't
represent these people

95
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:32,207
If they're just gonna
second-guess me

96
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,209
What is so important?

97
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,294
Do you like it?

98
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,628
What, the dress?
It's fine.

99
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:40,299
I was thinking maybe I could
wear your diamond hoops?

100
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,592
You know,
for good luck,

101
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,468
<i>Since you wore them
when you won prom queen.</i>

102
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,181
Amber, please don't tell me you're
relying on luck to win you a crown.

103
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:50,309
You have to reach out and
take the things you want.

104
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:54,146
I know. I just wanted
to show you my-

105
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,356
I had
another thought.

106
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,317
Yes. Right.

107
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,527
I think we should
delay...

108
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,453
It's just darling.
Ha ha ha!

109
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,371
Oh, no one will know
it was mine.

110
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,373
Yeah, it's been so long,
all the witnesses are dead.

111
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,375
Stop it.
Tonight can be fun

112
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,502
If you just let it be.

113
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,420
Are you gonna help me out
at all with this?

114
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:26,595
Honey, I know you're feeling
awkward going without a date,

115
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:29,598
But the school website said
there'll be lots of solo kids.

116
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,225
There's no stigma
to it.

117
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,477
No stigma at all.
Welcome, losers.

118
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,563
Hush. That is not the
attitude to walk in there with.

119
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,273
I said I'd go.
That's all you get.

120
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:45,364
Hey, you know what? I think
that's the dress I was wearing

121
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,407
When we made you.
Right, henry?

122
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,617
Stop.

123
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:51,537
He was such a tiger
back then.

124
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:53,330
Mom... Stop.

125
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:54,456
I know, I know.

126
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:07,386
"if accepted at juilliard...

127
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:09,513
I would be... "

128
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:14,268
So freakin' grateful
to have an actual life.

129
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,274
"if accepted...

130
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:24,444
"I would bring
my great enthusiasm

131
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,155
"for all musical forms...

132
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:32,411
Including voice
and composition. "

133
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,246
Hey!

134
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:37,249
I didn't think
I'd see you here!

135
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,458
Hey, nick,
how's it going?

136
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,544
What's up, man?
You ready for this?

137
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:45,465
Sure, nick.
I'd love to dance.

138
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:48,302
Just let me get rid of
my imaginary date first.

139
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,287
Here you go.

140
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,456
Heh. Seriously?

141
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,130
<i>Paisley, we're here. Great.</i>

142
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,216
Voting just ended.
Perfect timing.

143
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,470
What are you doing?

144
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,181
Dropping you off. There
aren't any close spots.

145
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:37,226
You don't really expect the queen
to walk in there alone, do you?

146
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,519
I need to make
an entrance.

147
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,145
Yeah, but I'm
not gonna-

148
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,396
Make a spot. Now.

149
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,362
oh, man.

150
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,613
Don't worry
about it, really.

151
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,204
Come on! Move it!

152
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,263
Hey, amber!

153
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,267
Hey, girl!

154
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,185
What's up, amber?

155
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,436
Hey, girl!

156
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,284
Yes, indeed.

157
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:39,204
Let's give it up
for mixmaster ashley eagle!

158
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,419
And, as our hard-working
vote committee

159
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,212
Is tallying up the results,

160
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:51,049
I'd like to welcome
all of the students tonight

161
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,385
Feel better, barry?

162
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,347
Awesome.

163
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,559
I've just been handed
an envelope.

164
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:03,228
I wonder what's inside.

165
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,606
What do you think,
mixmaster?

166
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,357
All right.

167
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:13,450
Now, this year's
ashley high school

168
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,328
Holy toledo! For the first time
in school history,

169
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,331
A unanimous decision...

170
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,632
Amber pollock!

171
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,260
Yes!

172
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,481
Amber, no!

173
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:49,483
It's too dangerous!
That crown is mine.

174
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,501
It's okay, it's okay.
I'm all right.

175
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:09,419
Stand back,
don't touch her.

176
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:12,172
People, hey...
I'm over here.

177
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:22,516
No, not moving at all.

178
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:24,309
Yeah.

179
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,602
As a doornail.

180
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,232
No! I can't be dead!

181
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:31,608
This is so unfair!

182
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,318
I had it in my hands.

183
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,656
Are you kidding me?

184
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:46,290
I always knew heaven
wouldn't allow nasty cuticles.

185
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,666
Do you have
an appointment?

186
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,335
But no one's even here.

187
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,671
That's because they all
have their own place to wait.

188
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,175
So...

189
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,342
This isn't heaven?

190
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,261
Let's just say it's
kind of halfway-

191
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:01,263
Like limbo-
made just for you.

192
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:06,226
Amber pollock.

193
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:08,228
Date of death-
right now.

194
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,397
Can you believe how
speedy these gadgets are?

195
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,191
I really think
they're the future.

196
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:14,359
Well...

197
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,320
Weren't you a nasty
piece of business.

198
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,487
What's that supposed
to mean?

199
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,531
Ashley high
consensus says...

200
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,283
"queen bitch".

201
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,286
Pretty hellish,
I'd say.

202
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,581
Hellish? That doesn't
mean I'm going to-

203
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:29,291
Not as yet.

204
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,168
Your life arc
was interrupted

205
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,544
Before reaching
its full formation,

206
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:35,297
So you're getting an
opportunity to raise your scores.

207
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,216
Putting it
in high school terms,

208
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,384
You're, like,
getting an extension.

209
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:42,387
So, I'm, like,
repeating a grade?

210
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,597
I have to go back?

211
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:45,432
Not in corporeal form.

212
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:47,226
You'll be more like
a spirit.

213
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:49,645
And you'll have a specific
task to accomplish.

214
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,272
If you succeed,
it's wings and a harp,

215
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:55,359
Never a bad hair day, and
you'll always be model-thin.

216
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,236
If you fail, well...

217
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:59,571
How do you look
in asbestos?

218
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:05,410
Lookie here.

219
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,579
The task they've given
you is rather ironic,

220
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,540
Since you were very nearly
crowned prom queen.

221
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,333
It was unanimous,
you know.

222
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,168
Lucky you.

223
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,462
You must take
the least popular student

224
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:19,135
And get this individual
elected queen

225
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,467
What?

226
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:22,469
And here she is-

227
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:24,221
The misshapen
lump of clay

228
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:25,556
That you must mold.

229
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:26,598
She doesn't go
to my school.

230
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:29,601
Lisa sommers.

231
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,353
Been in your class
for eight years.

232
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:34,189
She was your lab partner
in freshman biology.

233
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,525
No. I've never
seen her in my life.

234
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:38,610
Maybe this will help.

235
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:42,281
<i>That girl?
Prom queen?</i>

236
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:43,448
That's a joke.

237
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:46,660
Listen, sister,
you have one week.

238
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,183
Is best expressed
by those closest

239
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:10,475
To the one we have lost.

240
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,520
Thank you to those
who showed up today.

241
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:17,357
Well, this seems to be it,
so we might as well start.

242
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,484
Is this all for me?

243
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,320
So, I'd like to invite those
who were closest to amber

244
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,239
To come up and share
your love for her.

245
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,450
A memory, an anecdote,

246
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,328
A short story of what
she meant to you.

247
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,497
Let me just say thank you.

248
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,290
Thank you all.

249
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:42,341
Hello?

250
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:45,594
We have microphones on
either side of the stage,

251
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:50,349
So please take
as much time as needed

252
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:57,564
All right, then.

253
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,274
Hey.

254
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:02,194
Let's have a moment
of silence for amber.

255
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:06,198
Honey.

256
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:08,534
On prom night, of all
nights, she's gotta die.

257
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:12,371
She promised me
- promised that when she got that crown,

258
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,331
She was finally
gonna let me do her.

259
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:17,125
I dented my car
because of her.

260
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:20,212
And what do I get?
Nothing.

261
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:21,505
This is worse than dying!

262
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:24,383
Where is my group?
Where are my girls?

263
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:36,270
That was beautiful.

264
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:39,356
I will now unveil
the memorial portrait

265
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:42,150
That will hang
on the wall

266
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:46,446
Where we
hang pictures

267
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:58,250
You like the photo I picked?

268
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:05,257
Stop laughing, all of you!

269
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:07,467
I demand you
to stop laughing now!

270
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,178
Amber?

271
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:12,264
Do you see
what I see?

272
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:14,099
I see justice.

273
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,601
Why, what do you see?

274
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,146
No! No!

275
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:20,439
Lisa?

276
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,567
Okie-dokie.
That was so moving.

277
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:26,195
Well, the Saturday
committees

278
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,113
For make-up prom

279
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:29,406
Will meet after lunch.

280
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:31,533
And let's make it a
safe one, okay, people?

281
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:34,453
Where are you all going?

282
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:37,122
This is so wrong.
You all love me.

283
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:39,166
Somebody say something now.
I'm popular!

284
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,501
<i>I'm tmost popular!</i>

285
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:45,130
You! You can see me.

286
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,216
No. No, I can't.

287
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:48,467
<i>You can see me,
and you can hear me.</i>

288
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:50,302
Wait, come back!
I need to talk to you!

289
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:06,485
There you are.
Stay right there.

290
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,080
That was kind of cool.

291
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:21,416
Hey.

292
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:27,339
Hello.

293
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,550
That's 20 minutes of my
life I'm never getting back.

294
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:31,468
Hey, the girl died.

295
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,137
It's genuinely sad.
Show a little respect.

296
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,557
Aw, bless you,
nameless nerd boy.

297
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:46,191
And everyone wonders
why I never date.

298
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:48,193
Chicks are just crazy.

299
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:55,325
It's just stress, lisa.
That's all.

300
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:58,203
Music school applications,
senior anxiety.

301
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,455
It's a natural reaction.

302
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:03,125
You know, this whole
"you run, I chase" thing

303
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:05,210
Is getting
boring fast.

304
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,130
Why are you here?
What did I do?

305
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:09,548
Nothing,
from what I can tell.

306
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:12,217
<i>It's whi'm
gonna do for you.</i>

307
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,552
Get out of here. Now.

308
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:15,345
Hey,
it's a public bathroom.

309
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:18,223
Yes, of course.

310
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:20,058
Okay, I'll give you
five minutes.

311
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,310
Just not in here.

312
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,527
Prom queen-

313
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:32,487
Me?
Yep, by Saturday.

314
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,573
Okay. Joke's over.

315
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:37,117
Lisa sommers officially
looks like a fool.

316
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,368
Hooray to whoever's
doing this.

317
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,162
Do you really think I
could make all this up?

318
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:42,164
I have to admit,
you're not that smart.

319
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:43,165
Excuse me!

320
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:44,416
It just doesn't
make sense.

321
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,293
<i>Why would I
want to help you?</i>

322
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:49,254
Because... I'm the only
one that can help you.

323
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,590
Don't you see? I can make you popular.

324
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,300
I don't want
to be popular.

325
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:55,469
Poor thing.

326
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:57,346
Everyone wants
to be popular.

327
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,223
In five days
with me in charge,

328
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:00,432
You'll be the talk
of the school.

329
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:02,267
Everyone
will be wondering,

330
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,519
"what's liza wearing
today? What's liza thinking?

331
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,270
Where's liza going
tonight?"

332
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,231
It's lisa.

333
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:09,066
Well, if you're popular,
people would know that.

334
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,150
My friends
know my name.

335
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:11,401
All two of them?
Three!

336
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:13,278
Okay, mousy bits, if you
don't want to be popular,

337
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:15,113
What exactly
do you want?

338
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:20,285
I want to get
out of here.

339
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:22,120
I want to go
to music school.

340
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,372
I want to live in a world
where they don't judge you

341
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:26,291
By how many people want
to sit with you at lunch.

342
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,460
Instead...

343
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:30,295
They appreciate
the fact

344
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:33,131
That your playlist not only
has the newest gaga,

345
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,550
But all of
haydn's symphonies,

346
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,468
Charles ives'
concord sonata,

347
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,428
And the ella fitzgerald
songbooks,

348
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,305
Because they're
all magic works of genius,

349
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:42,182
And they transport me.

350
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,312
You done yet?

351
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:48,480
You're deader
than I am.

352
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:50,274
And you're
a vacuous shrew.

353
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:52,526
Come on! You have
to do this for me,

354
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:55,112
Otherwise they're sending me
to hell, and I don't want to go.

355
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,197
Why? There'll be so many
people just like you.

356
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,157
I can't believe you
don't want to help me.

357
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,450
You know what?

358
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:02,286
I don't think I'm gonna get
another chance to say this

359
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:03,537
And really
make it happen,

360
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:06,331
But, for all I care,
you can go to hell.

361
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:18,218
She's stubborn,
doesn't listen to reason,

362
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,013
And she only cares about
what she wants. I hate her!

363
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,223
Why? Too much
like yourself?

364
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:26,143
I offered her the greatest
gift of high school-

365
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:27,895
Complete popularity.

366
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:29,771
And she tells me
to go to hell.

367
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:31,106
Amber,
dear, sweet child,

368
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:33,066
Sometimes we can't
accomplish a task

369
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,818
Simply by browbeating
the weak.

370
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,904
Why not?
Often-

371
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:38,780
And I know this is a
radical notion for you-

372
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:41,825
We must actually think
of the other person.

373
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:48,040
But that sounds
really hard.

374
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,792
Very well, then. We won't put
you through any more of this.

375
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,839
hello, this is j-3
in arbitration.

376
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:57,799
I have
a miss amber pollock.

377
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,177
She's given up and is
ready for processing.

378
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:04,890
I'll ask.

379
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:07,893
Would you prefer being
slowly skinned by demons,

380
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:12,022
Or having your pretty nails
pulled out, one by one?

381
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:16,068
I know. Hard to imagine clawing
your way past the little people

382
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:20,906
Without ten little talons of
sinful ruby rouge number 17.

383
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:22,157
Tacky, by the way.

384
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:25,911
I guess I can give lisa
one more shot.

385
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:28,831
You'd do that for her?

386
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:30,040
How sweet.

387
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:33,877
You have ghostly powers.
Use them.

388
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,177
Lise, I've been
waiting for you.

389
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:43,887
I didn't want to
come up behind you

390
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:45,973
'cause I noticed
you were kind of jumpy.

391
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:47,182
What? Wha-wha-
what makes you say that?

392
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:50,018
The fact that you're...
Kind of jumpy.

393
00:21:51,854 --> 00:21:53,021
Are you okay?

394
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:54,773
What happened
this morning?

395
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:55,941
Can I ask you
something?

396
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:57,818
But you have to promise
to keep it between us.

397
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,069
Come on,
we're best friends.

398
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:03,073
What if I told you amber
pollock visited me today?

399
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:05,951
You mean, like,
as a ghost,

400
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:07,786
Or some kind of spirit?

401
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:09,913
Just hearing
the words out loud

402
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:11,165
Makes it seem
even more crazy.

403
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:12,791
Forget I said
anything.

404
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,002
Lise, you're
freaking me out.

405
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:16,879
Are you really
seeing amber?

406
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,797
I don't know, selena.

407
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:21,008
Maybe this is just some
kind of freakish dream.

408
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:23,927
Or maybe I'm actually unconscious
from a dangerously high fever

409
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:25,220
That's causing me
to hallucinate,

410
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,890
And hopefully sweat off that
donut I ate this morning.

411
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:30,934
Or maybe I'm just
going completely insane.

412
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:33,812
Okay, not true. A lot
of people see ghosts.

413
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:35,814
My aunt marielle
- she sees them all the time.

414
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:37,816
Of course,
there was that one week

415
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:39,067
When she only bathed
in ketchup.

416
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,944
But she's not insane.

417
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:42,863
And she says that ghosts
are nothing to mess with.

418
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:44,156
So, you better
be careful here.

419
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:47,993
You know what?
I don't even have time

420
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:49,244
To think about this
right now.

421
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:51,079
Whatever it was
is gone, thank god,

422
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:53,749
And I have to concentrate on
the real things in my life.

423
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,125
You mean you're gonna
go out to the field

424
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,252
And pretend to do your homework
while you stare at nick ramsey?

425
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:59,046
Okay, so, it's more
of a delusion,

426
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:00,923
But, uh, I'm
comfortable with it.

427
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:02,758
As long as you're sure
you're okay.

428
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,927
Yeah. Thanks.

429
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:10,766
Hey, nick!
This one's to you!

430
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:15,896
Nick ramsey.

431
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:17,940
Please get out
of my life.

432
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:20,817
Yay, nick!
Nice butt!

433
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:21,985
Good choice.

434
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:24,780
Choice? He doesn't
even know I'm alive.

435
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,114
I could get him
for you.

436
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:30,077
What if I told you

437
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:34,081
I could have you
in his arms like that?

438
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:35,874
Yeah, right.

439
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,210
Blue 42! Hut! Hike!

440
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:50,973
Heads up! Look out!

441
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:56,144
Are you okay?

442
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:04,027
You're lisa sommers,
right?

443
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:06,071
You and your friends make
those clay pig movies?

444
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:08,824
I watch them online.
They're funny.

445
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,703
Lisa. I'm-
I'm lisa.

446
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:13,996
Nick! You done
over there, man?

447
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:16,915
I gotta go.

448
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:23,797
A lot more where
that came from.

449
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,883
He has strong hands.

450
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:28,010
And he's just
between girlfriends.

451
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:29,761
Perfect time
to make your move.

452
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:32,014
No, no, I can't.
I'm just-I'm not-

453
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:35,851
No, no, no.
I'm not. I'm not.

454
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:37,144
Well said.

455
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:44,067
We were almost friends
in the seventh grade.

456
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:45,194
A bunch of us
went over to his house

457
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:47,738
To watch him feed
his pet snake.

458
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:49,740
Then everything changed
over the summer.

459
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:52,201
Some girls got breasts. I
got braces and piano lessons.

460
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:54,828
And he got tall
and athletic.

461
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,830
And we all know
how that turned out.

462
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:58,123
I always wondered
what might've happened

463
00:24:58,165 --> 00:24:59,875
If I just had
the courage to say,

464
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:02,961
"hey, nick, cool snake,"
you know?

465
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:04,880
You're like a human
sleeping pill.

466
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,715
Please don't ever talk
like that on a date.

467
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:07,883
But he knows my name.

468
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:09,092
And he's seen
pig tales.

469
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:10,928
Maybe I should leave him
a cool little message

470
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:12,721
In the next movie.

471
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:13,972
Look, I only have
five days.

472
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:15,891
You don't have to like me,
but I know how to hook a boy.

473
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:17,976
Are you really willing to pass that up?

474
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:20,103
Okay, it all starts
with how you look.

475
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:22,731
I know, I know. It's what's
on the inside that counts-

476
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:24,942
Blah, blah-which only ugly
people say, by the way.

477
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:28,153
But we're talking about
hardball high school popularity,

478
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:30,113
Which is based on looks
by about...

479
00:25:30,155 --> 00:25:32,950
170%.

480
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:35,202
And the good news is,
you're not ugly...

481
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:37,079
Exactly.

482
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,956
You just gotta work
on your presentation.

483
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:40,916
And that's what
my life is all about.

484
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:42,084
Was.

485
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:43,919
<i>Okay, fine. Was.</i>

486
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:45,796
That's why we're
doing this together.

487
00:25:45,838 --> 00:25:47,130
You're gonna help me
get into heaven,

488
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:49,925
And I'm gonna help
get nick into you.

489
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:51,760
Emotionally.

490
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:55,180
Wait.
That's my sister.

491
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:02,062
That's clementine.

492
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:04,940
God,
she looks so sad.

493
00:26:04,982 --> 00:26:07,776
I wonder
what happened.

494
00:26:07,818 --> 00:26:09,152
You died on Saturday.

495
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:10,946
Yeah.

496
00:26:10,946 --> 00:26:12,781
Hey, listen,
I gotta go.

497
00:26:12,823 --> 00:26:13,949
I'll catch you
later.

498
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:15,826
In the meantime,
wax.

499
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:17,786
Everything.

500
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:33,969
Hey, mom.

501
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:36,138
Did you go to the office at all today?

502
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,807
Your sister got into
washington college.

503
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:40,184
I didn't even know
she applied.

504
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:42,019
Why didn't she tell me?

505
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,812
<i>I did tell you.
Sdid tell you.</i>

506
00:26:43,854 --> 00:26:45,063
But you said
I wasn't good enough

507
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:46,857
To get into the school
where you went.

508
00:26:46,899 --> 00:26:48,150
Now what do I do
with this?

509
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,943
I'm gonna
start dinner,

510
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:51,987
'cause people get
hungry, you know?

511
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:55,782
You did it, honey...

512
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:57,993
With no help from me.

513
00:26:57,993 --> 00:27:00,913
You went out and got it.

514
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,915
I'll be damned.

515
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:13,675
You-lisa sommers-

516
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:14,968
Actually spoke
to nick ramsey?

517
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,094
I did.

518
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:17,179
Clear.
Clear.

519
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:18,764
Perfecto.

520
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:21,183
Click me off
two frames, raj.

521
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:22,809
It's speaking to me,
people.

522
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:24,144
Let's pick it up.

523
00:27:24,186 --> 00:27:26,021
Today you finally
talked to him

524
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:28,190
After five years
of slack-jawed gawking.

525
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,943
I don't know,
things just-

526
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:32,861
Things just happen.
It was weird.

527
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:35,030
No, they don't.
Not with you.

528
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:36,865
Clear.

529
00:27:36,907 --> 00:27:39,117
Wait, wait, cut. I want to
shoot this next one from above.

530
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:41,036
Let's go outside
and grab the ladder.

531
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:44,081
Are you sure
you're okay?

532
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:46,792
Because earlier, things
got a little, well...

533
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:47,960
You know.

534
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:50,170
Of course.
I'm better than okay.

535
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:53,715
I'm thinking of running
for prom queen.

536
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:55,884
What?

537
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:57,052
Okay.

538
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:00,055
Who was the first boy
that ever tried to kiss me,

539
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:01,932
And when did it happen?

540
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:04,059
What are you-
just answer the question.

541
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:07,104
It was
your cousin leo...

542
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:08,814
At your grandma's house
when you were ten.

543
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:10,107
What the hell
is wrong with you?

544
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:12,693
I had to make sure
it was still you in there.

545
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:15,112
Seriously? Prom queen?

546
00:28:16,947 --> 00:28:18,740
Who are you?

547
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:22,953
Prom queen.

548
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:39,970
Mom? Hello?

549
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:46,894
Excuse me.

550
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:48,729
Nice voice
in there, girl.

551
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:49,938
And the sweet tune
- is that something you wrote?

552
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,982
Have you ever heard
of a thing called privacy?

553
00:28:52,024 --> 00:28:54,985
I knew I had my work
cut out for me, but this-

554
00:28:54,985 --> 00:28:56,987
Please! I mean, nothing
goes with anything.

555
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:59,615
The salvation army would
reject this entire closet.

556
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:00,824
You're not going
to school today.

557
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:02,576
What? Why?

558
00:29:02,618 --> 00:29:03,660
You're calling in
unattractive.

559
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:04,912
We're gonna go
to the mall

560
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:06,747
And get you some outfits
from this time period.

561
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,836
Are you all right?
Did you see your sister?

562
00:29:12,878 --> 00:29:14,838
Yeah, I saw her.

563
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,590
Is she okay?

564
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:17,799
Let's just focus
on the job at hand,

565
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:19,009
Which is making you
look better.

566
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:20,719
I could use a little
of your help.

567
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:22,846
Lise, were you talking to somebody?

568
00:29:22,888 --> 00:29:24,723
No.

569
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:26,725
Not really.

570
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:28,977
Mom, I was thinking of
skipping school today

571
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:30,896
So maybe I could go
buy a new outfit

572
00:29:30,938 --> 00:29:33,023
For Saturday's
make-up prom.

573
00:29:33,065 --> 00:29:34,691
Are you crazy?

574
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:35,859
You can't tell your mom you're cutting.

575
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:38,779
You want to buy
a new outfit?

576
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,948
Honey!

577
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:43,033
That's wonderful!

578
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:46,078
Do you need money? I'll just take
some out of your dad's wallet.

579
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:52,960
So, do you always tell
your parents the truth?

580
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:55,879
I mean, like, what do
you do when you sneak out?

581
00:29:55,921 --> 00:29:57,047
I don't sneak out.

582
00:29:57,089 --> 00:30:00,676
Come on. Even amish
girls sneak out to...

583
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:02,678
Raise a barn
or something.

584
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:06,849
Did you have to
make it this hard?

585
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:11,061
Try on
that blue outfit.

586
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,078
How do you like it?

587
00:30:29,163 --> 00:30:31,790
This is not me.
That's the point.

588
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:33,750
<i>If they sold you here,
they'd go out of business.</i>

589
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:35,752
I cannot wear
something like this.

590
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:36,795
Why? Someone might
find out you're cute?

591
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:38,005
I am not cute.

592
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:39,840
I hate to be the one
to deliver the bad news,

593
00:30:39,882 --> 00:30:41,758
But you are.
You've got boobs,

594
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:44,052
Which you seem to be in
denial about, and actual legs,

595
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:45,137
Which you could
show off on occasion.

596
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:46,805
And...

597
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:47,973
A perfectly nice little
butt, I have to say.

598
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:49,850
Are you coming on to me?
Honey...

599
00:30:49,892 --> 00:30:51,018
I'm telling you
what guys like.

600
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:52,102
And it's not
that complicated.

601
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:53,187
Now, zip it down.

602
00:30:58,025 --> 00:30:59,693
Hike it up.

603
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:02,112
The dress.

604
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:07,117
Now do this.

605
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,913
No, I refuse.

606
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:11,997
Do it.
Think of nick.

607
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:16,960
You're not ready
for that.

608
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,754
Let's stick to the
clothes. Hold that one up.

609
00:31:21,757 --> 00:31:23,884
No, you couldn't pull it off. Could.

610
00:31:23,926 --> 00:31:26,094
I would so kill
in that dress.

611
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:29,806
How'd you do that?

612
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:31,725
I don't know.

613
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:33,769
I thought I was gonna be stuck
in that prom dress forever.

614
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,103
My god.

615
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:38,815
I have fashion powers!
Ha ha!

616
00:32:25,988 --> 00:32:27,781
You told her we're meeting
for lunch, right?

617
00:32:27,823 --> 00:32:29,700
You were standing
right there, colin.

618
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:30,951
Then she must be
sick or something.

619
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:32,786
Well, she'd better not
be blowing us off.

620
00:32:32,828 --> 00:32:34,079
Who said we were
being blown off?

621
00:32:36,874 --> 00:32:39,209
She-she wouldn't do that.

622
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:48,969
Hmm. How about a shorter
cut with some highlights?

623
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:50,762
No.

624
00:32:50,804 --> 00:32:52,931
Okay. What about
a swoop bang

625
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:54,766
And some lowlights?

626
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:56,018
I don't think so.

627
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:57,769
Maybe we should just
turn the lights off.

628
00:32:57,811 --> 00:32:59,062
Hey.

629
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:01,064
We can dye it blond.

630
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:04,735
Bad idea.

631
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:06,737
I know what'll
fix this mess.

632
00:33:06,737 --> 00:33:08,739
Let's add
some length.

633
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:14,703
That's nice.

634
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:27,090
Now, every girl needs
her signature scents

635
00:33:27,132 --> 00:33:28,926
That their boy
can find in the dark.

636
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:31,094
Great. So, it's like
being sniffed out by a dog.

637
00:33:32,888 --> 00:33:34,765
look at that.

638
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:37,142
What? Zac efron boy over there.

639
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:43,732
He's not
looking at me.

640
00:33:43,774 --> 00:33:45,150
Well, he's sure not
looking at me.

641
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:47,736
This is perfect-
a starter boy.

642
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:48,946
Call him over.

643
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:50,906
I don't know his name.

644
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:54,159
Call him over.

645
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:07,005
Hi.

646
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:10,133
Um... I never know what
to say to a pretty girl.

647
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:12,135
Well, that's not
a bad start.

648
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:14,763
Say it. That's not a bad start.

649
00:34:14,805 --> 00:34:17,975
Damn cute, isn't he?

650
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:19,643
Just say hi.
Hi.

651
00:34:19,685 --> 00:34:21,061
Hi, my name's aiden.

652
00:34:22,688 --> 00:34:24,106
Now tell him your name.
Back off.

653
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:25,732
I'm sorry, I was just-

654
00:34:25,774 --> 00:34:27,150
No, no, no, no.
You're fine.

655
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:30,779
I'm lisa.
And I have to go.

656
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:31,989
What?
Right now?

657
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,907
Yep. I was just here
buying things for my prom,

658
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:35,033
And now I'm done.

659
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:37,119
What are you doing?
He's great.

660
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:39,705
If I come by tomorrow,
will I see you?

661
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:41,790
I don't know.
Probably not.

662
00:34:41,832 --> 00:34:43,000
Bye.

663
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,960
You just discarded
a perfect good boy.

664
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:46,044
Congrats.

665
00:34:46,086 --> 00:34:47,796
What if it led
to something?

666
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:49,047
What if he
asked me out?

667
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:51,133
This is about nick, not
some cute guy in a store.

668
00:34:51,175 --> 00:34:52,926
These moral convictions
of yours

669
00:34:52,968 --> 00:34:54,178
Are only getting
in the way.

670
00:35:11,862 --> 00:35:13,655
Everybody's gonna
laugh at me.

671
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:15,699
They're gonna say, "who
are you trying to fool?"

672
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:18,035
I'm going home.
No, you're not.

673
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:19,828
Do you want to be
an unpopular nonentity

674
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,079
For the rest
of your life?

675
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:22,915
Yes. I'm good at it.

676
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:24,917
This is about confidence.

677
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:26,752
Nobody actually has it.

678
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:29,046
You just
have to project it.

679
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:32,716
I'm out.

680
00:35:32,758 --> 00:35:34,676
No, you're not.

681
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:41,892
That was so weird. What
the hell just happened?

682
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:43,936
I don't know.

683
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:46,188
But I love that
I can do that.

684
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:53,111
Would you stop fighting me?

685
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:55,072
What am I supposed to do?

686
00:35:55,072 --> 00:35:57,074
Nothing. Let me drive.

687
00:35:57,074 --> 00:36:00,869
No. Yes. No! Yes!

688
00:36:00,911 --> 00:36:02,079
Go!

689
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:29,064
This is amazing.
Quiet!

690
00:36:29,106 --> 00:36:30,816
Morning, boys.

691
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:32,651
Could you do me
the hugest favor?

692
00:36:32,693 --> 00:36:34,111
I need your signature for
my prom queen petition?

693
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:35,821
Would you mind?

694
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:38,657
<i>Thank you.
Thank you.</i>

695
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:40,784
Luke, that's a great shirt.
Looks so good on you.

696
00:36:40,826 --> 00:36:42,953
Kyle, did you get
a haircut? 'cause it works.

697
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:45,956
This is fun.

698
00:36:45,956 --> 00:36:47,916
What the hell
happened to her?

699
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:49,918
She's obviously
not sick.

700
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,962
She looks great-
like a different person.

701
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:54,131
Yeah, a person
crying for help.

702
00:36:57,718 --> 00:36:59,136
My god, what a rush!

703
00:36:59,136 --> 00:37:01,054
Is this what popularity
feels like?

704
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:03,640
Yes. And that's
just a taste.

705
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,893
You want to fly solo?

706
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:07,811
Can I?

707
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:14,902
Let's see it.

708
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,822
No, no, no.
Not them.

709
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:21,074
They have no heat. You
need to seek the heat.

710
00:37:23,994 --> 00:37:25,662
Yes. Nice.

711
00:37:25,704 --> 00:37:27,664
That's some heat.

712
00:37:27,706 --> 00:37:28,790
Hi, adam.

713
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:30,083
Lisa, is that you?

714
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:34,004
Would you do me the
giant-est favor in the world?

715
00:37:34,046 --> 00:37:36,048
Have you been
working out?

716
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:37,674
Like, at the gym
and stuff?

717
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:39,009
Yeah. See you.

718
00:37:42,804 --> 00:37:45,682
Well, look at you, all
talking to the boys.

719
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:48,060
I'm gonna walk down this
hallway for the rest of my life.

720
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:51,939
Hey, has anybody here not signed
carlita's prom queen petition?

721
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,107
carlita's running
against me?

722
00:37:54,149 --> 00:37:55,818
I mean, against you?

723
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:57,861
Is that bad?
It's terrible.

724
00:37:57,903 --> 00:37:59,822
I taught her everything.
She'll annihilate us.

725
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:01,782
Come on.
You're amber pollock.

726
00:38:01,824 --> 00:38:03,700
What does she have
that we don't?

727
00:38:07,037 --> 00:38:08,747
Nick.
Nick.

728
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:30,811
I thought you said he
was between girlfriends.

729
00:38:30,853 --> 00:38:32,646
<i>That's not between.
That's on.</i>

730
00:38:32,688 --> 00:38:33,939
Did you see
that kiss?

731
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:35,732
How could carlita
do this to me?

732
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:38,694
That crown was mine to
give, and I didn't pick her.

733
00:38:38,694 --> 00:38:40,821
That wannabe is not
sending me to hell.

734
00:38:40,863 --> 00:38:43,866
He's never gonna put his big
strong hand on my butt again.

735
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:45,951
We can still
get him for you...

736
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:47,744
As soon as we stop
carlita.

737
00:38:47,786 --> 00:38:50,706
We just have to figure
out what her next move is.

738
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:51,999
How?

739
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,709
Gee, I don't know.

740
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:54,960
It's not like
one of us is invisible

741
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:56,879
And can walk through walls
or anything.

742
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:03,010
Here he comes.

743
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:05,596
Looks like he's
getting over amber.

744
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:07,723
So, how come you didn't
go for brandon?

745
00:39:07,723 --> 00:39:09,725
And look like I'm
picking up amber's scraps?

746
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:11,685
No. That's a loser move.

747
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:13,979
I wanted somebody
on the way up-nick.

748
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:15,898
Smart move.

749
00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:18,734
Way up. Nick.

750
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,069
She's in my seat.

751
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:22,905
All right, guys,
Friday night,

752
00:39:22,905 --> 00:39:24,615
Everybody who's cool...

753
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:25,657
Will be at my house.

754
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:27,034
Next day...

755
00:39:27,075 --> 00:39:28,911
Everybody's buzzing
about it,

756
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:31,038
Which carries right into the
prom voting Saturday night.

757
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:34,625
So, it has to be
a great party.

758
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:37,794
Paisley, can you get
your stoner brother

759
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:39,838
To stop playing video games
long enough to buy us beer?

760
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,674
Good. And, dakota...
"dakota... "

761
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:44,801
Your friend's band-
panda house- get them.

762
00:39:44,843 --> 00:39:46,762
But they don't do
parties anymore.

763
00:39:46,762 --> 00:39:48,847
Tell them you'll
sleep with them.

764
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:50,766
Okay.

765
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:53,644
All right, these are
all the important people.

766
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:57,105
Why not invite
everybody to the party?

767
00:39:57,147 --> 00:39:59,691
Paisley, you still need
a ruling class

768
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:01,652
For the pathetic people
to look up to.

769
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:05,656
If I invite the masses, I
come off as... Approachable.

770
00:40:05,697 --> 00:40:07,825
And that's dead.

771
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:10,035
Not stupid
amber electrocution dead,

772
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:11,870
But pretty close.

773
00:40:14,915 --> 00:40:17,042
You... Look thirsty.

774
00:40:17,084 --> 00:40:18,794
Let's roll, girls.

775
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:26,677
The world has people
for that.

776
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:35,060
Thanks, aunt marielle.

777
00:40:35,102 --> 00:40:36,854
You're the only one
who can help me.

778
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:37,980
Give me the photos.

779
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:39,731
Something is
definitely going on.

780
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:41,692
I don't if she's trying
to take over lisa's body,

781
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:44,027
Or steal her soul,
or god knows what.

782
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:46,905
But I'm not giving up my
best friend without a fight.

783
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:48,991
We must break her grip
and deliver this amber

784
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:50,159
To her ultimate
destination.

785
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,953
But how? We can't
even see her.

786
00:40:52,995 --> 00:40:55,914
You don't see spirits
with your eyes.

787
00:40:55,956 --> 00:40:58,876
You see them with...
Inner vision.

788
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:02,129
Like eyes...
Inside your body.

789
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:05,883
And you wonder why people
think you're a whack-job?

790
00:41:05,924 --> 00:41:07,634
do you want
to see the ghost?

791
00:41:07,676 --> 00:41:08,802
Yes.

792
00:41:08,844 --> 00:41:10,095
I will attempt
to conjure her

793
00:41:10,137 --> 00:41:12,014
From these photos.

794
00:41:18,854 --> 00:41:21,064
She was very powerful
in life, wasn't she?

795
00:41:21,106 --> 00:41:24,693
Think medusa with blond
snakes and killer pumps.

796
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:28,822
Now, this amber-

797
00:41:28,864 --> 00:41:31,950
Her soul is in peril, and
your friend is the key.

798
00:41:31,992 --> 00:41:33,869
Does that mean
lisa's in danger?

799
00:41:33,911 --> 00:41:36,038
It does.
Their bond is strong.

800
00:41:36,038 --> 00:41:37,998
There's only one way
to stop her.

801
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,124
Tell me.

802
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:40,918
What's the last thing
amber touched

803
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:42,753
Before she left
this plane?

804
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:44,922
I know.

805
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:47,841
And I'm gonna get it.

806
00:41:57,726 --> 00:42:00,729
I'm gonna get ya,
ghost bitch.

807
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:17,746
Carlita's
throwing a party?

808
00:42:17,788 --> 00:42:19,706
Yes, and that's why you're
gonna throw one, too.

809
00:42:19,748 --> 00:42:20,874
Won't hers be better?

810
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:22,960
Let's just say hers
is gonna run into...

811
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:24,711
A little trouble.

812
00:42:24,753 --> 00:42:25,921
This one's
still logged on.

813
00:42:25,963 --> 00:42:28,090
Great. That way, they
can't trace it back to you.

814
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:29,925
This is so wrong.

815
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:31,844
What's your point?
Write the email?

816
00:42:31,885 --> 00:42:33,762
Right.

817
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:37,683
Wait. You got
carlita's address wrong.

818
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:38,934
<i>It's fairview place,
nlane.</i>

819
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:41,979
Come on.

820
00:42:46,024 --> 00:42:48,026
Ready to send?

821
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:50,779
I feel almost...
Criminal.

822
00:42:50,821 --> 00:42:52,698
Do you want to feel
almost nick?

823
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:54,700
Sending.

824
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:56,034
It's out there.

825
00:42:56,076 --> 00:42:57,786
Blackberries are jingling,
iphones are shaking,

826
00:42:57,828 --> 00:42:59,079
People are buzzing.

827
00:42:59,121 --> 00:43:02,749
I feel it, too.
Being bad is exciting.

828
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:04,042
Welcome to life.

829
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:05,711
Now let's go.

830
00:43:17,139 --> 00:43:18,932
Party time!

831
00:43:18,974 --> 00:43:20,684
What are you doing here?

832
00:43:20,726 --> 00:43:21,768
Party!
Party!

833
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:22,853
The party's tomorrow.

834
00:43:22,895 --> 00:43:24,938
The message.
What message?

835
00:43:26,148 --> 00:43:27,858
I didn't send that.

836
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,942
Say cheese!
No, don't!

837
00:43:28,984 --> 00:43:30,736
What the hell is this?

838
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:33,739
Get in the car!
Come on, you punk!

839
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,115
I'm calling the police.

840
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:40,913
Hey, there's
another party!

841
00:44:06,772 --> 00:44:08,649
Lisa, when did you
plan this party?

842
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,818
You know, I just kind of
threw it together.

843
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:12,653
And my parents got
a free spa weekend,

844
00:44:12,694 --> 00:44:13,779
So you could put
those drinks anywhere.

845
00:44:13,821 --> 00:44:14,947
Lisa, the band's here.

846
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:16,824
Thank you for doing this
on such short notice.

847
00:44:16,865 --> 00:44:19,660
No problem.
We're gonna go set up.

848
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:20,953
It was fantastic.

849
00:44:20,994 --> 00:44:22,788
Carlita never knew
what hit her.

850
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:25,666
Awesome party, lisa.
Have a nice time.

851
00:44:25,707 --> 00:44:27,668
People are really
showing up.

852
00:44:27,709 --> 00:44:28,877
Go ahead and mix. Don't
stay here in the corner,

853
00:44:28,919 --> 00:44:29,962
Talking
to yourself, girl.

854
00:44:30,003 --> 00:44:31,129
Right. That was
the old me.

855
00:44:31,171 --> 00:44:32,840
Actually, the old you
never went to parties.

856
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:34,091
Right again.

857
00:44:34,132 --> 00:44:35,843
I'd love to stay
and chat, but...

858
00:44:35,884 --> 00:44:36,927
I've got a party
to host.

859
00:44:42,891 --> 00:44:46,019
How do people leave the
house without my help?

860
00:44:46,061 --> 00:44:47,813
Ech.

861
00:44:52,901 --> 00:44:54,153
I'm a little confused.

862
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:56,864
Why would carlita send us
to a party that isn't hers?

863
00:44:56,905 --> 00:44:59,658
We're checking up on the
competition. It's intelligence.

864
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,909
Cool.

865
00:45:00,951 --> 00:45:02,703
I love being
intelligence.

866
00:45:02,744 --> 00:45:04,872
God, this is such a great
party. Totally great.

867
00:45:04,913 --> 00:45:06,790
It's like something
amber would've done.

868
00:45:06,832 --> 00:45:07,916
You think?

869
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,678
Nick is here. I don't know what to say.

870
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,807
You're not gonna
sanything.

871
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:26,852
I called carlita,
and she was crying,

872
00:45:26,894 --> 00:45:28,896
And she started
yelling.

873
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:30,022
I asked her
what happened,

874
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:31,648
But she just
hung up on me.

875
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:32,733
I'll tell you
what happened.

876
00:45:32,774 --> 00:45:33,859
Somebody
burned her good.

877
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:36,028
Huh. Should I
call her again?

878
00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:37,779
No. She'll just
hang up.

879
00:45:37,821 --> 00:45:39,656
Best party
of the year.

880
00:45:39,698 --> 00:45:43,827
So, whose house
is this, anyway?

881
00:45:43,869 --> 00:45:45,078
Lisa sommers-
that music weirdo

882
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,997
Who suddenly turned,
like, red-hot in two days.

883
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:48,749
<i>So red-hot.</i>

884
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:52,002
Are you kidding me?

885
00:45:52,044 --> 00:45:53,754
I only do that
in the shower.

886
00:45:53,795 --> 00:45:55,797
That's it, I'm coming in. You cannot-

887
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,674
You cannot make me.

888
00:45:57,716 --> 00:45:59,801
Stop it. Stop it!
Get out of me!

889
00:45:59,843 --> 00:46:00,969
Get out of me!

890
00:46:13,732 --> 00:46:16,652
Can you guys do me the
hugest favor in the world?

891
00:46:19,822 --> 00:46:22,783
Just keep it simple
and follow me. Thanks.

892
00:46:43,011 --> 00:46:45,138
I can't do this.
You already are.

893
00:47:25,012 --> 00:47:27,055
I'm doing this.
I know.

894
00:47:27,097 --> 00:47:29,766
This is amazing.
Lisa, it's your voice.

895
00:47:29,808 --> 00:47:31,768
I just got you up here. Now,
can I get out so I can watch you?

896
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:32,769
No, no, no.

897
00:48:57,938 --> 00:48:59,106
Thanks for coming.

898
00:48:59,148 --> 00:49:02,025
That-
that was amazing.

899
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:05,612
The things I have to do
to get your attention.

900
00:49:05,654 --> 00:49:06,780
Nice.

901
00:49:06,822 --> 00:49:07,990
Thank you.

902
00:49:08,031 --> 00:49:09,908
<i>No, thank you.</i>

903
00:49:16,957 --> 00:49:19,626
You really surprised
people tonight.

904
00:49:19,668 --> 00:49:21,879
Did I surprise you?

905
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,715
Yes, you did.

906
00:49:26,008 --> 00:49:28,886
You know, I've kind of
been going out with carlita,

907
00:49:28,927 --> 00:49:31,096
But it's not
really serious.

908
00:49:31,138 --> 00:49:32,973
It's just been
a few days.

909
00:49:37,728 --> 00:49:40,022
Do you remember back in
the seventh grade

910
00:49:40,063 --> 00:49:41,815
When I had
a bunch of people over

911
00:49:41,857 --> 00:49:43,650
To watch me feed jimbo?

912
00:49:43,692 --> 00:49:45,068
You know, my pet snake.

913
00:49:46,862 --> 00:49:48,780
I was thinking about that the other day.

914
00:49:48,822 --> 00:49:50,032
You were there,
right?

915
00:49:53,785 --> 00:49:55,829
Seventh grade-
um, maybe.

916
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:57,831
Who even remembers
that far back?

917
00:50:09,176 --> 00:50:12,846
I'm gonna go tell carlita
things aren't working out.

918
00:50:12,846 --> 00:50:14,056
I would like that.

919
00:50:14,097 --> 00:50:15,724
Yeah?

920
00:50:33,951 --> 00:50:36,078
My god.
She looks horrible.

921
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:37,329
So horrible.

922
00:50:37,371 --> 00:50:39,373
I know. I got sent, like,
15 different pictures.

923
00:50:39,414 --> 00:50:41,291
It's just too awful.

924
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:42,960
So awful.

925
00:51:12,197 --> 00:51:13,323
Do you need me
for this?

926
00:51:13,323 --> 00:51:14,992
I've got it from here.

927
00:51:20,122 --> 00:51:21,957
So, lisa, what are
you doing for lunch?

928
00:51:30,174 --> 00:51:32,050
This is some strange...

929
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:51,320
I know you're
in there, amber.

930
00:51:51,361 --> 00:51:53,030
Leave my friend alone.

931
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:54,364
You're messing
with the wrong girl.

932
00:51:54,364 --> 00:51:56,033
Selena, are you okay?

933
00:51:56,033 --> 00:51:58,202
<i>I wiget you.</i>

934
00:52:02,206 --> 00:52:03,957
Isn't it pathetic

935
00:52:03,999 --> 00:52:06,293
How some people can't handle
other people's success?

936
00:52:08,045 --> 00:52:10,172
Hey, lise, how was the big
party we weren't invited to?

937
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:13,175
<i>As awesome as everyone
who was invited says?</i>

938
00:52:13,217 --> 00:52:15,052
Colin, come on.
She's still our friend.

939
00:52:15,052 --> 00:52:16,887
Is she, now?

940
00:52:16,887 --> 00:52:18,055
Excuse me, boys,

941
00:52:18,096 --> 00:52:20,140
But doesn't the virgin's
club meet during lunch

942
00:52:20,182 --> 00:52:21,225
To polish their
purity rings?

943
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:25,062
Golly,
that is so rich.

944
00:52:25,062 --> 00:52:27,147
I'm gonna process that
and laugh at it later-

945
00:52:27,189 --> 00:52:29,983
You know, while you're out
getting your s. T.D. Shots.

946
00:52:30,025 --> 00:52:31,944
Guys, guys, guys.

947
00:52:31,985 --> 00:52:33,362
The party was
a last-minute thing.

948
00:52:33,403 --> 00:52:35,030
I meant to call.
I just-

949
00:52:35,072 --> 00:52:36,114
Only invited
the cool people.

950
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:38,033
'cause that's how
it works these days.

951
00:52:38,075 --> 00:52:39,117
Colin, would you
give her a chance?

952
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:41,286
Yeah, it was-

953
00:52:41,328 --> 00:52:42,955
I was-

954
00:52:42,996 --> 00:52:45,165
It was a-
I just-

955
00:52:45,207 --> 00:52:47,084
Got it. Thanks for
clearing that up.

956
00:52:47,084 --> 00:52:49,086
So, listen, we've got to
finish this pig movie tonight.

957
00:52:49,086 --> 00:52:50,379
So, are you there?

958
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:52,381
Or is being cool your new
full-time gig these days?

959
00:52:58,136 --> 00:52:59,888
Sorry I missed
our lunch plans,

960
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:02,099
But I was too busy
getting this.

961
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:03,934
For me?

962
00:53:03,976 --> 00:53:06,854
I had no other
creative way to, uh,

963
00:53:06,895 --> 00:53:08,272
Ask you to prom
tomorrow night.

964
00:53:08,272 --> 00:53:10,274
Ahem.

965
00:53:10,315 --> 00:53:12,192
Yeah. Right.

966
00:53:12,234 --> 00:53:14,987
Guys...

967
00:53:15,028 --> 00:53:16,989
Things have gotten really crazy
in the last couple of days,

968
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:18,157
And I just-

969
00:53:18,198 --> 00:53:19,324
I don't have time
for the movie right now.

970
00:53:19,366 --> 00:53:21,994
Maybe on
the next one, okay?

971
00:53:30,961 --> 00:53:32,296
I know that was
probably hard.

972
00:53:32,296 --> 00:53:34,214
Skinny and runt boy liked
you when you were nothing.

973
00:53:34,256 --> 00:53:36,216
And, believe me,
you were nothing.

974
00:53:36,258 --> 00:53:38,218
But that was
a bold move.

975
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,179
You know, I think you're
finally getting this.

976
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:42,222
I'll make it up
to them after prom.

977
00:53:42,264 --> 00:53:44,975
Maybe I'll to rub some of my
new popularity off on them,

978
00:53:45,017 --> 00:53:46,185
And then they'll
understand.

979
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:48,061
Lisa, hey.
Hey.

980
00:53:48,103 --> 00:53:50,022
I know you got a lot of
new stuff going on,

981
00:53:50,063 --> 00:53:51,190
And that's great.

982
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,901
And colin is-
is colin.

983
00:53:53,942 --> 00:53:55,235
But we need you
on the movie.

984
00:53:55,277 --> 00:53:57,321
We count on you.

985
00:53:57,321 --> 00:53:59,239
I count on you.

986
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:01,992
I know, raj.

987
00:54:02,034 --> 00:54:03,994
Maybe sometime
next week.

988
00:54:03,994 --> 00:54:06,079
Mr. Kurkuri...

989
00:54:06,121 --> 00:54:08,040
You were logged onto
computer terminal 14

990
00:54:08,081 --> 00:54:09,958
Yesterday after school,
right?

991
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,293
You were also logged on
to that computer

992
00:54:11,335 --> 00:54:12,878
Until this morning.

993
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,129
I guess I forgot
to log off.

994
00:54:14,171 --> 00:54:15,881
Did you, now?

995
00:54:15,923 --> 00:54:17,132
Did you know there
was a bogus email

996
00:54:17,174 --> 00:54:19,092
Sent from that computer

997
00:54:19,134 --> 00:54:21,887
About a social event held by
another student at this school?

998
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:23,972
That action is
a suspendable offense.

999
00:54:24,014 --> 00:54:25,849
And it also
created damage

1000
00:54:25,891 --> 00:54:27,184
Which happened to
another student's house,

1001
00:54:27,184 --> 00:54:29,937
Which is something you'll have
to take up with the police.

1002
00:54:29,978 --> 00:54:31,897
But I was just
trying to buy a-

1003
00:54:31,939 --> 00:54:32,981
Do you know anything
about this?

1004
00:54:33,023 --> 00:54:34,107
No, nothing.

1005
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:38,153
But I'm sure
it was just a goof.

1006
00:54:38,195 --> 00:54:40,864
A rather serious goof.

1007
00:54:40,906 --> 00:54:43,200
Come with me. We're gonna
talk to your parents.

1008
00:54:50,374 --> 00:54:52,376
Well...

1009
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:54,378
That didn't work out
as I expected.

1010
00:54:56,088 --> 00:54:58,882
Maybe we should try
to do something about it.

1011
00:55:00,968 --> 00:55:02,845
Raj will be fine.

1012
00:55:02,886 --> 00:55:05,889
I can't risk getting nailed for
this one day before the prom.

1013
00:55:05,889 --> 00:55:07,891
I'm doing this for
both of us, amber.

1014
00:55:07,933 --> 00:55:09,268
I need to be
elected queen,

1015
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:11,186
And you need to get
into heaven...

1016
00:55:11,228 --> 00:55:13,063
Which we wouldn't have to
worry about if you'd been nicer.

1017
00:55:13,105 --> 00:55:14,940
I can be nice.

1018
00:55:16,108 --> 00:55:18,026
Sometimes.

1019
00:55:18,068 --> 00:55:19,319
Maybe when
you were five,

1020
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:21,238
But that girl's
long gone.

1021
00:55:21,238 --> 00:55:24,366
I like your jeans.

1022
00:55:46,138 --> 00:55:48,265
I was five.

1023
00:55:57,941 --> 00:55:59,318
I miss you.
I miss you.

1024
00:56:09,161 --> 00:56:11,163
Are you gonna
do this every day?

1025
00:56:11,205 --> 00:56:12,956
I don't know.

1026
00:56:12,998 --> 00:56:15,834
I need this form for
my science field trip.

1027
00:56:15,876 --> 00:56:17,127
You still haven't
signed it.

1028
00:56:17,127 --> 00:56:19,129
I didn't?
You didn't.

1029
00:56:22,132 --> 00:56:24,968
You're not looking
at her, mom.

1030
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:26,261
Look at her.

1031
00:56:26,303 --> 00:56:28,305
Mom, I'm trying to hold
this house together.

1032
00:56:28,305 --> 00:56:31,016
But I could use
a little help.

1033
00:56:32,142 --> 00:56:33,894
Do you even hear me?

1034
00:56:35,896 --> 00:56:37,231
Amber:
She's crying out for you.

1035
00:56:37,272 --> 00:56:40,150
This is it, mom.

1036
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:42,236
You want to
make it up to me,

1037
00:56:42,277 --> 00:56:44,238
Do something for her.

1038
00:56:46,031 --> 00:56:47,157
For clementine.

1039
00:56:51,912 --> 00:56:53,205
Mom!

1040
00:57:14,101 --> 00:57:17,062
I'm going to
be there for you.

1041
00:57:17,104 --> 00:57:19,022
I haven't been.

1042
00:57:21,066 --> 00:57:23,026
I'm gonna do better.

1043
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:28,073
Better.

1044
00:57:29,992 --> 00:57:31,869
We'll all be bet-

1045
00:57:40,919 --> 00:57:43,005
Mom? Clem?

1046
00:57:44,381 --> 00:57:46,049
What's going on?

1047
00:57:46,091 --> 00:57:48,343
We're-
we're putting an end

1048
00:57:48,385 --> 00:57:51,180
To all your evil ghost
plans, amber pollock.

1049
00:57:51,221 --> 00:57:53,015
Excuse me, do we
know each other?

1050
00:57:53,056 --> 00:57:55,309
We've only been in the
same class for nine years.

1051
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:58,979
Jeez. Really?

1052
00:57:59,021 --> 00:58:01,106
Did you change your
hair or something? No.

1053
00:58:01,148 --> 00:58:02,983
Listen, evil one...

1054
00:58:03,025 --> 00:58:06,069
We have you now, and you are never
gonna bother lisa sommers again.

1055
00:58:06,069 --> 00:58:07,196
You've totally
corrupted her!

1056
00:58:07,237 --> 00:58:09,198
I know, I know.

1057
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:11,116
Everything that was
bad about me-

1058
00:58:11,158 --> 00:58:13,035
The way I treated people
- it's her now,

1059
00:58:13,076 --> 00:58:14,870
And it's
all my fault.

1060
00:58:14,912 --> 00:58:16,914
What are you doing?

1061
00:58:16,914 --> 00:58:18,874
Is this a trick?

1062
00:58:20,209 --> 00:58:22,252
Please let me go.
I have to talk to lisa.

1063
00:58:22,294 --> 00:58:24,296
You think that after
what you've done,

1064
00:58:24,338 --> 00:58:27,049
We're just gonna
let you free to do more?

1065
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:28,926
Ha!
Selena...

1066
00:58:28,926 --> 00:58:30,177
I sense remorse.

1067
00:58:30,219 --> 00:58:34,097
And only a spirit can undo
what a spirit has done.

1068
00:58:34,097 --> 00:58:35,933
Thank you...

1069
00:58:35,933 --> 00:58:38,101
Weird lady.

1070
00:58:38,101 --> 00:58:39,269
Well said.

1071
00:58:39,311 --> 00:58:41,855
Okay. Okay.

1072
00:58:41,897 --> 00:58:43,232
But you have to promise

1073
00:58:43,273 --> 00:58:45,859
To turn lisa back into the
nice girl she was before.

1074
00:58:45,901 --> 00:58:47,986
I really want to, but
it's not gonna be easy.

1075
00:58:48,028 --> 00:58:52,115
I mean, she's hot and
sexy and popular now,

1076
00:58:52,157 --> 00:58:54,910
And it's hard
to give up.

1077
00:58:54,952 --> 00:58:57,287
You wouldn't know.
Obviously.

1078
00:58:59,289 --> 00:59:01,291
Sorry. That slipped.

1079
00:59:03,877 --> 00:59:06,129
My gosh!
Of course!

1080
00:59:06,129 --> 00:59:07,840
You're that
mousy brainiac

1081
00:59:07,881 --> 00:59:09,967
Who skipped
a grade.

1082
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:12,135
That's me. Smart...

1083
00:59:12,177 --> 00:59:14,012
And mousy.

1084
00:59:14,054 --> 00:59:16,306
Well, let me just say
you look a lot better now.

1085
00:59:16,306 --> 00:59:19,143
But that purple eye shadow
- not helping.

1086
00:59:19,143 --> 00:59:20,978
She's right about
the eye shadow.

1087
00:59:20,978 --> 00:59:24,064
Go! Save lisa.

1088
00:59:35,075 --> 00:59:37,828
Boy, it is great
in here.

1089
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:39,872
You've got the
candles over there.

1090
00:59:39,913 --> 00:59:42,249
We've got you and me
right here.

1091
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:45,169
We've got my parents still
out of town till Sunday.

1092
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,881
Lisa, we need to talk.

1093
00:59:48,922 --> 00:59:50,007
Not now.
Okay.

1094
00:59:50,007 --> 00:59:52,217
No, no, you're fine.

1095
00:59:52,259 --> 00:59:54,011
Seriously.

1096
00:59:54,011 --> 00:59:55,179
It's very important.

1097
00:59:55,179 --> 00:59:57,097
Now is not a time
for talking.

1098
00:59:57,139 --> 00:59:58,849
Yeah.

1099
01:00:03,312 --> 01:00:05,856
That was nice.

1100
01:00:05,856 --> 01:00:07,900
I'm not leaving,
you know.

1101
01:00:12,321 --> 01:00:14,198
Is something wrong?

1102
01:00:14,198 --> 01:00:16,950
No, no, it's perfect.
You're perfect.

1103
01:00:16,992 --> 01:00:18,243
I can't stand what
I've done to you.

1104
01:00:18,285 --> 01:00:19,912
I've ruined
your life.

1105
01:00:19,953 --> 01:00:21,079
My life is fine,
thank you.

1106
01:00:21,121 --> 01:00:22,956
Mine, too.

1107
01:00:22,998 --> 01:00:25,167
You're self-centered
and shallow.

1108
01:00:25,209 --> 01:00:27,961
And it's all
because of me.

1109
01:00:28,003 --> 01:00:29,963
And you'll continue to keep
getting more self-centered

1110
01:00:30,005 --> 01:00:32,007
And more shallow
unless you stop right now.

1111
01:00:32,049 --> 01:00:34,218
I'm not stopping.
Me, neither.

1112
01:00:34,218 --> 01:00:36,887
You need to stop. I can't
let you become another me.

1113
01:00:36,929 --> 01:00:39,139
So, that's what this is?
You're jealous.

1114
01:00:39,181 --> 01:00:40,933
I've become a better you
than you were,

1115
01:00:40,974 --> 01:00:42,059
And you can't stand it.

1116
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:43,185
Huh?
Not you.

1117
01:00:43,227 --> 01:00:45,062
You thought,
"let me work my magic

1118
01:00:45,103 --> 01:00:46,980
On the pathetic ugly duckling
and make her almost presentable. "

1119
01:00:47,022 --> 01:00:49,983
But I've surpassed you.
I'm better, hotter,

1120
01:00:50,025 --> 01:00:51,235
Smarter... Alive.

1121
01:00:54,196 --> 01:00:56,281
You know...

1122
01:00:56,323 --> 01:00:58,033
Lise...

1123
01:00:59,243 --> 01:01:01,161
You're acting
kind of crazy.

1124
01:01:03,914 --> 01:01:05,249
It's hot.

1125
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:06,959
Yeah.

1126
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,127
This is important.

1127
01:01:09,169 --> 01:01:10,921
If you become prom queen,

1128
01:01:10,963 --> 01:01:12,214
It will ruin you.

1129
01:01:12,256 --> 01:01:14,258
I need to be crazy
for just one more second.

1130
01:01:14,258 --> 01:01:15,884
Okay.

1131
01:01:17,219 --> 01:01:19,012
I'm going to become
prom queen,

1132
01:01:19,054 --> 01:01:20,264
And you're gonna go
to heaven.

1133
01:01:20,305 --> 01:01:22,099
It's a win-win.
Now get out of here.

1134
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:23,892
That's it.

1135
01:01:31,316 --> 01:01:33,110
Okay.

1136
01:01:33,152 --> 01:01:35,070
This is not hot
anymore.

1137
01:01:45,956 --> 01:01:47,166
Don't worry about lisa.

1138
01:01:47,207 --> 01:01:49,084
I mean... I'm fine.

1139
01:01:49,126 --> 01:01:51,170
Nick, honey, we can't
have sex tonight.

1140
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:52,921
Why don't you
just go home?

1141
01:01:54,173 --> 01:01:56,216
Okay.

1142
01:01:58,135 --> 01:01:59,887
But can we do it
tomorrow night?

1143
01:01:59,928 --> 01:02:02,055
Sure. Whatever.
Right after prom.

1144
01:02:02,097 --> 01:02:03,265
Just go home.

1145
01:02:03,307 --> 01:02:04,933
Okay.

1146
01:02:04,975 --> 01:02:06,226
But I'll be
warming up.

1147
01:02:07,853 --> 01:02:09,146
Okay.

1148
01:02:12,024 --> 01:02:14,818
I'm so sorry I did this
to you, lisa.

1149
01:02:33,128 --> 01:02:36,048
Where are we?
No place.

1150
01:02:36,089 --> 01:02:37,841
And too far
out of town

1151
01:02:37,883 --> 01:02:39,092
To get back
for the prom.

1152
01:02:39,134 --> 01:02:41,220
What? Why?

1153
01:02:41,261 --> 01:02:43,138
I'm doing this
for you, lisa.

1154
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:45,974
Wait, you're doing this
for you, too.

1155
01:02:46,016 --> 01:02:48,018
Don't you want
to go to heaven?

1156
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:50,979
Not that much.

1157
01:02:57,361 --> 01:02:58,946
No! No! No!

1158
01:02:58,987 --> 01:03:00,823
Don't leave me here!

1159
01:03:12,876 --> 01:03:14,086
She's not stopping me.

1160
01:03:14,127 --> 01:03:16,088
I'm getting to that prom.

1161
01:03:16,129 --> 01:03:18,215
I have lots of friends.
I'm popular.

1162
01:03:18,257 --> 01:03:20,133
All I have to do
is call one of them,

1163
01:03:20,175 --> 01:03:23,053
And they'll be crawling all over
each other to come rescue me.

1164
01:03:59,006 --> 01:04:00,924
Does that phone work?

1165
01:04:02,259 --> 01:04:05,888
it does if you
got change.

1166
01:04:11,935 --> 01:04:13,937
Nick, it's lisa.

1167
01:04:15,147 --> 01:04:17,900
Hey, crazy lady.
Hi, sweetie.

1168
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:21,153
No time to explain, but I need you
to drive out oak springs, highway 7

1169
01:04:21,195 --> 01:04:22,237
<i>And pick me up.</i>

1170
01:04:22,279 --> 01:04:23,947
I'm surrounded
by dead things.

1171
01:04:23,989 --> 01:04:26,867
Oak springs. Damn,
that's a long way.

1172
01:04:26,909 --> 01:04:30,120
I know. And it's getting
late, so you have to start now.

1173
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,122
Yeah, babe, jeez...

1174
01:04:32,164 --> 01:04:34,124
If only I could.

1175
01:04:34,124 --> 01:04:36,126
<i>But I don't want to die. Die?</i>

1176
01:04:36,126 --> 01:04:38,128
Yeah, I just entered
the nova star,

1177
01:04:38,128 --> 01:04:40,047
And if you quit
before you make overlord,

1178
01:04:40,088 --> 01:04:42,257
They cut off your head and you
have to start all over again.

1179
01:04:42,299 --> 01:04:43,926
What the hell
are you talking about?

1180
01:04:43,967 --> 01:04:47,846
The nova star.
Babe, this is big.

1181
01:04:47,888 --> 01:04:49,139
We have to be at prom
in six hours.

1182
01:04:49,181 --> 01:04:51,099
Okay, can we just
meet there?

1183
01:04:51,141 --> 01:04:53,060
You know what?
Never mind.

1184
01:04:53,101 --> 01:04:55,062
Wait, we're still having
sex afterwards, right?

1185
01:04:55,103 --> 01:04:56,271
Of course.

1186
01:04:57,981 --> 01:05:00,234
No! No, my head! Ohh!

1187
01:05:06,156 --> 01:05:08,909
Thank god.
Paisley, it's lisa.

1188
01:05:08,951 --> 01:05:11,036
I need you to come
and get me in oak springs.

1189
01:05:11,078 --> 01:05:12,913
You're getting
your hair colored.

1190
01:05:12,955 --> 01:05:15,958
Of course.
Curls before girls.

1191
01:05:15,999 --> 01:05:17,167
Who doesn't live by that?

1192
01:05:17,209 --> 01:05:19,169
No, I'll just call dakota.

1193
01:05:19,211 --> 01:05:21,129
They're with you.

1194
01:05:21,171 --> 01:05:23,924
No, of course her curls
are important, too.

1195
01:05:26,009 --> 01:05:28,887
Far more important
than me being stranded

1196
01:05:28,929 --> 01:05:31,890
In the middle of nowhere.

1197
01:05:31,932 --> 01:05:34,935
Hi. It's lisa sommers.

1198
01:05:36,228 --> 01:05:39,189
Emily. It's lisa sommers.

1199
01:05:39,231 --> 01:05:42,943
Listen, thank you for that invite
to go shopping and grab a latte.

1200
01:05:42,985 --> 01:05:45,070
But if you really
want to bond,

1201
01:05:45,112 --> 01:05:46,905
Don't you think spending four
or five hours in a car would be-

1202
01:05:46,947 --> 01:05:47,990
Hello?

1203
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,867
Hola, isabelle.

1204
01:05:51,118 --> 01:05:53,036
Really?

1205
01:05:53,036 --> 01:05:55,038
Doesn't word
travel fast?

1206
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,040
Yeah, it's very funny.
Ha ha.

1207
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:00,043
Listen, I don't suppose
you'd be up for-

1208
01:06:00,085 --> 01:06:02,129
Please stop laughing.

1209
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:14,224
You're so damn slow.

1210
01:06:14,266 --> 01:06:17,144
Look, tarantino, we're a
little shorthanded today.

1211
01:06:17,186 --> 01:06:18,812
Give me a second.

1212
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:22,024
No personal
phone calls.

1213
01:06:22,065 --> 01:06:23,233
Bite me.

1214
01:06:23,275 --> 01:06:25,235
Hello?

1215
01:06:25,277 --> 01:06:27,196
Thank god.
Lisa?

1216
01:06:27,237 --> 01:06:30,782
Okay, calm down.
It's okay.

1217
01:06:30,824 --> 01:06:32,242
We'll be there.

1218
01:06:34,244 --> 01:06:37,915
Thank you guys so much
for coming to get me.

1219
01:06:37,915 --> 01:06:40,083
I thought I was popular,
but nobody would come.

1220
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:41,877
They were all getting
their hair done.

1221
01:06:42,961 --> 01:06:44,129
I can't believe
how stupid I was.

1222
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:45,923
I can't believe the way
I treated you guys.

1223
01:06:45,923 --> 01:06:48,091
I'm so sorry.
Especially you, raj.

1224
01:06:48,133 --> 01:06:50,093
You should be.
He got suspended,

1225
01:06:50,093 --> 01:06:51,929
And he has to perform
community service

1226
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:53,972
Fixing carlita's yard.

1227
01:06:54,014 --> 01:06:55,265
You're worse than amber.

1228
01:06:55,307 --> 01:06:57,226
You went from zero to
satan in, like, two days.

1229
01:06:57,267 --> 01:07:01,146
That's what I've been telling
you. She was possessed.

1230
01:07:01,188 --> 01:07:04,942
Right. The great
ghost bimbo from beyond.

1231
01:07:04,942 --> 01:07:07,110
I wasn't possessed.
This was all me.

1232
01:07:07,152 --> 01:07:08,862
See? No ghost.

1233
01:07:08,904 --> 01:07:10,781
No, there's a ghost.

1234
01:07:10,781 --> 01:07:13,242
There was. Or-
oh, my god. Amber.

1235
01:07:13,283 --> 01:07:14,993
I've got to save her.

1236
01:07:15,035 --> 01:07:16,245
You're about
a week late, remember?

1237
01:07:16,286 --> 01:07:18,831
"give me that crown!"
zzzzzt! "aaaah!"

1238
01:07:18,872 --> 01:07:22,251
Colin, I need you to get
me to the prom right now.

1239
01:07:24,962 --> 01:07:26,296
Come on!

1240
01:07:29,007 --> 01:07:33,262
Hello?

1241
01:07:33,303 --> 01:07:35,973
Mr. Purgatory man?

1242
01:07:36,014 --> 01:07:37,141
Miss pollock.

1243
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:41,019
The prom isn't
till this evening.

1244
01:07:41,061 --> 01:07:43,147
We can't send you upstairs
until it's official.

1245
01:07:43,188 --> 01:07:46,150
I'm not gonna be
going upstairs.

1246
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:49,153
Really? I was getting
such positive reports.

1247
01:07:49,153 --> 01:07:51,280
It didn't work out.

1248
01:07:51,321 --> 01:07:53,073
I failed.

1249
01:07:53,115 --> 01:07:56,827
So, send me,
I guess... Down?

1250
01:07:56,869 --> 01:07:58,203
Are you sure
about this?

1251
01:07:58,245 --> 01:08:00,080
I think you could
pull this off.

1252
01:08:00,122 --> 01:08:02,916
I'm sure.

1253
01:08:04,168 --> 01:08:06,044
Okie-dokie.

1254
01:08:10,966 --> 01:08:12,885
Your ride is here.

1255
01:08:29,526 --> 01:08:31,820
I thought all the fun
people were going to hell.

1256
01:08:33,447 --> 01:08:35,532
A knife fight?
Two dead?

1257
01:08:35,574 --> 01:08:37,534
That's kindergarten
stuff.

1258
01:08:37,576 --> 01:08:40,537
I sold high-risk mortgages
to homeless people,

1259
01:08:40,579 --> 01:08:42,539
Only so I could repo
their new abodes

1260
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:44,541
And make them
homeless again.

1261
01:08:44,583 --> 01:08:46,710
What did you do,
blondie?

1262
01:08:46,752 --> 01:08:48,504
I was...

1263
01:08:48,545 --> 01:08:49,713
Mean to everyone.

1264
01:08:52,508 --> 01:08:54,635
Rookie.

1265
01:09:14,571 --> 01:09:16,406
Exquisite. Fabulous.

1266
01:09:16,448 --> 01:09:18,700
No drinking.
Arrive alive.

1267
01:09:18,742 --> 01:09:21,787
Miss sommers... What
happened to your shoes?

1268
01:09:24,748 --> 01:09:26,792
Nothing. It-
it's a thing I'm trying.

1269
01:09:26,834 --> 01:09:28,710
Well, you're certainly
cutting it close.

1270
01:09:28,752 --> 01:09:30,587
They're about to start
voting. Go check it.

1271
01:09:30,587 --> 01:09:32,756
Thank god. Wait,
I need to talk to you.

1272
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:35,592
Raj is innocent. I was the
one who sent out the emails

1273
01:09:35,634 --> 01:09:37,761
About carlita's party.
Okay, bye.

1274
01:09:37,761 --> 01:09:39,680
Little missy.

1275
01:09:39,721 --> 01:09:42,558
If that's the case, you're
suspended immediately,

1276
01:09:42,599 --> 01:09:44,393
And ineligible
from prom queen.

1277
01:09:44,434 --> 01:09:45,769
No, you have
to let me run.

1278
01:09:45,811 --> 01:09:47,771
Please,
it's so important.

1279
01:09:47,813 --> 01:09:50,566
Hey, hey, hey.

1280
01:09:50,607 --> 01:09:52,609
No underwear showing!

1281
01:09:52,609 --> 01:09:54,444
Where'd she-

1282
01:09:54,486 --> 01:09:55,654
What's up?

1283
01:09:55,696 --> 01:09:57,614
Did you guys get dressed
in the dark?

1284
01:09:57,614 --> 01:09:59,491
Whatever happened
to tuxedos?

1285
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:04,746
<i>Woman over speaker:
Attention life losers-</i>

1286
01:10:04,788 --> 01:10:07,749
<i>Please keep your hands
and feet inside the shuttle</i>

1287
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:09,793
<i>At all times.</i>

1288
01:10:09,793 --> 01:10:13,547
<i>In a moment, we'll be entering
the outer reaches of hell.</i>

1289
01:10:13,589 --> 01:10:15,549
<i>As the temperature rises,</i>

1290
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:18,468
<i>Please refrain from
screaming and pleading.</i>

1291
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:19,803
<i>Trust us-</i>

1292
01:10:19,845 --> 01:10:22,723
<i>We've heard it all.</i>

1293
01:10:27,811 --> 01:10:29,646
Can I get your attention,
everybody?

1294
01:10:29,646 --> 01:10:30,939
Can I get your attention
real quick?

1295
01:10:32,816 --> 01:10:35,861
Hello. All right.

1296
01:10:35,903 --> 01:10:37,821
Let me just remind everyone

1297
01:10:37,821 --> 01:10:41,742
That lisa sommers is no longer
eligible as a candidate.

1298
01:10:41,783 --> 01:10:43,869
So, that leaves...

1299
01:10:43,911 --> 01:10:45,913
Well, just carlita cache.

1300
01:10:45,954 --> 01:10:49,500
All right, well, good luck...
Everybody!

1301
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:51,668
I hate my life.

1302
01:10:56,507 --> 01:10:57,633
God, carlita...

1303
01:10:57,674 --> 01:10:58,759
Everyone is voting
for you.

1304
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,469
They sure are.

1305
01:11:05,641 --> 01:11:06,850
Thanks, girls.

1306
01:11:06,892 --> 01:11:08,727
Would you get me
some punch?

1307
01:11:08,769 --> 01:11:10,813
Yes.
No, me!

1308
01:11:13,899 --> 01:11:16,485
Everybody, could I-

1309
01:11:16,527 --> 01:11:19,488
Excuse me, everybody?
Can I-

1310
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:20,906
Can I get your
attention, please?

1311
01:11:25,828 --> 01:11:28,539
Please let me do this.

1312
01:11:30,707 --> 01:11:33,418
What is she doing? She
said she had an idea.

1313
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:35,838
Something that's going
to fix everything.

1314
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:41,802
First of all...

1315
01:11:41,844 --> 01:11:44,471
I was the one who sabotaged
carlita's party.

1316
01:11:44,513 --> 01:11:46,723
I knew it.
Totally knew it.

1317
01:11:46,765 --> 01:11:49,560
I was the one who
sent those emails,

1318
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:50,894
Not my
good friend raj.

1319
01:11:50,936 --> 01:11:53,897
I was trying to
take carlita down.

1320
01:11:55,691 --> 01:11:57,901
You see...
I was so tired

1321
01:11:57,943 --> 01:12:01,446
Of not being seen,

1322
01:12:01,488 --> 01:12:02,781
That when I finally
got the chance,

1323
01:12:02,823 --> 01:12:05,576
I was willing to do
anything to be noticed,

1324
01:12:05,617 --> 01:12:07,411
To feel special.

1325
01:12:08,662 --> 01:12:10,706
I thought being popular
would make everything better,

1326
01:12:10,747 --> 01:12:12,499
But it didn't.

1327
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:13,876
You know what else
I found out?

1328
01:12:13,917 --> 01:12:16,503
Being popular does not
mean everybody likes you.

1329
01:12:16,545 --> 01:12:17,838
This is dangerous.

1330
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,756
She's tampering with
the fundamental dynamics

1331
01:12:19,756 --> 01:12:21,633
Of the high school
universe.

1332
01:12:25,554 --> 01:12:27,598
Be honest.

1333
01:12:27,598 --> 01:12:30,767
How many of you have ever
felt the way I did?

1334
01:12:30,809 --> 01:12:32,895
How many of you walk
into this school every day

1335
01:12:32,936 --> 01:12:34,938
And wonder if anyone
really cares?

1336
01:12:36,815 --> 01:12:38,567
How many of you have worried

1337
01:12:38,609 --> 01:12:39,860
About whether your clothes
are cool enough,

1338
01:12:39,902 --> 01:12:41,820
Or if you're listening
to the right music?

1339
01:12:43,655 --> 01:12:45,449
Or how many of you
have been hurt

1340
01:12:45,449 --> 01:12:47,701
When you find out about a party
you were never invited to?

1341
01:12:49,912 --> 01:12:53,457
And how many of you have done
something really stupid and insensitive

1342
01:12:53,457 --> 01:12:55,459
Just to be part of
the cool crowd?

1343
01:12:59,713 --> 01:13:02,424
What about this?

1344
01:13:02,466 --> 01:13:05,469
What if the cool crowd
was all of us?

1345
01:13:05,469 --> 01:13:06,637
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1346
01:13:06,678 --> 01:13:09,473
What if going to school
wasn't a competition?

1347
01:13:09,515 --> 01:13:10,766
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1348
01:13:10,808 --> 01:13:13,769
What if we all just said,
"screw this!"

1349
01:13:15,646 --> 01:13:17,439
Screw having a contest

1350
01:13:17,481 --> 01:13:18,774
That draws attention
to someone

1351
01:13:18,816 --> 01:13:20,484
Who clearly
doesn't need it.

1352
01:13:20,526 --> 01:13:23,654
Screw the idea that
you can't look around

1353
01:13:23,695 --> 01:13:25,489
At everybody in this room

1354
01:13:25,531 --> 01:13:29,576
And believe that you couldn't
be friends with any of them.

1355
01:13:29,618 --> 01:13:31,870
This year, let's make
tonight mean something.

1356
01:13:34,456 --> 01:13:36,583
Let's shower that attention on
somebody who's just a good person,

1357
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:38,836
Who's a real friend,

1358
01:13:38,877 --> 01:13:40,754
Somebody who believes
the best of everybody.

1359
01:13:40,796 --> 01:13:42,631
Yeah!

1360
01:13:44,675 --> 01:13:46,677
Let's vote for raj kurkuri.

1361
01:13:46,677 --> 01:13:48,804
who?!

1362
01:13:48,846 --> 01:13:50,514
Raj!

1363
01:13:50,556 --> 01:13:53,475
"who?" right.
Exactly my point.

1364
01:13:53,517 --> 01:13:54,852
After tonight,
let's make sure

1365
01:13:54,852 --> 01:13:56,687
We never ask that again.

1366
01:13:58,564 --> 01:13:59,731
Who is it?
Sure.

1367
01:14:01,775 --> 01:14:03,527
Raj! Raj!

1368
01:14:03,527 --> 01:14:06,530
Raj! Raj! Raj!

1369
01:14:06,572 --> 01:14:10,701
Raj! Raj! Raj!

1370
01:14:10,742 --> 01:14:12,411
Raj! Raj!

1371
01:14:12,452 --> 01:14:14,496
You know what?
Forget about counting ballots.

1372
01:14:14,538 --> 01:14:16,456
Let's vote right now.

1373
01:14:16,498 --> 01:14:18,584
Everybody who's for raj,
raise your hand.

1374
01:15:18,727 --> 01:15:21,772
<i>The white-hot plasma
outside the window</i>

1375
01:15:21,772 --> 01:15:24,608
<i>Indicates we are nearing
our final destination,</i>

1376
01:15:24,608 --> 01:15:27,444
<i>So please fasten
your seat belts.</i>

1377
01:15:27,444 --> 01:15:29,822
<i>Just joking.
You're already dead.</i>

1378
01:15:29,863 --> 01:15:33,617
<i>In order to make your arrival
even more unpleasant,</i>

1379
01:15:33,617 --> 01:15:36,787
<i>The man downstairs would like you
to please deposit your teeth and hair</i>

1380
01:15:36,787 --> 01:15:39,832
<i>Into the small bin
provided at the exit.</i>

1381
01:15:39,873 --> 01:15:41,917
<i>Then please move on
to the next line,</i>

1382
01:15:41,959 --> 01:15:43,794
Where a hot metal tube

1383
01:15:43,836 --> 01:15:46,922
<i>Will drop you into an
endless lake of molten lava.</i>

1384
01:15:52,845 --> 01:15:54,471
Amber, dear.

1385
01:15:54,471 --> 01:15:56,557
The oddest thing
just happened.

1386
01:15:56,598 --> 01:15:58,475
The least popular person
in your high school

1387
01:15:58,517 --> 01:16:00,769
Was just elected
prom king.

1388
01:16:00,811 --> 01:16:02,855
King?

1389
01:16:02,896 --> 01:16:05,482
What can I say?
It's a modern world.

1390
01:16:05,482 --> 01:16:06,775
You know
what this means?

1391
01:16:08,485 --> 01:16:10,737
Heaven?
Eventually.

1392
01:16:10,779 --> 01:16:14,867
But right now, scads
and scads more paperwork.

1393
01:16:14,908 --> 01:16:16,869
So, you're
coming with me.

1394
01:16:21,707 --> 01:16:23,667
And, to the rest
of you...

1395
01:16:23,709 --> 01:16:24,793
Bye-bye.

1396
01:16:35,804 --> 01:16:38,599
Hey!
Hey!

1397
01:16:43,729 --> 01:16:44,855
Just you in there?

1398
01:16:44,897 --> 01:16:46,857
Just me.

1399
01:16:46,899 --> 01:16:49,485
Hey, this is
great and all,

1400
01:16:49,526 --> 01:16:51,653
But we've got a lot of work to
do on the movie, starting tonight.

1401
01:16:54,823 --> 01:16:57,701
Or tomorrow.
Tomorrow's good.

1402
01:17:05,417 --> 01:17:06,835
Give me a sec.

1403
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:16,553
The sweet dweeb
got the crown.

1404
01:17:16,595 --> 01:17:17,805
Not bad.

1405
01:17:17,846 --> 01:17:19,765
I like your gown.

1406
01:17:22,726 --> 01:17:24,812
They told me
it comes with wings.

1407
01:17:24,853 --> 01:17:27,564
But I'm not ready
to accessorize.

1408
01:17:32,569 --> 01:17:36,490
So...

1409
01:17:38,534 --> 01:17:40,452
Hey, give me a minute,
would you?

1410
01:17:41,787 --> 01:17:43,539
Thank you.

1411
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:46,792
Listen...

1412
01:17:46,834 --> 01:17:49,586
I think you're
a great person,

1413
01:17:49,586 --> 01:17:51,839
And I want you
to have a great life.

1414
01:17:53,757 --> 01:17:55,676
And I was telling you
the truth.

1415
01:17:55,717 --> 01:17:57,553
A little confidence
doesn't hurt.

1416
01:17:58,762 --> 01:18:02,808
Now, don't become an amber,
but, you know...

1417
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:04,560
Somewhere
in the middle.

1418
01:18:04,601 --> 01:18:06,603
Yeah.

1419
01:18:06,645 --> 01:18:08,772
Hey, you're gonna be
a huge hit in college.

1420
01:18:09,773 --> 01:18:11,608
I know it.

1421
01:18:11,608 --> 01:18:13,402
Actually, I peaked.

1422
01:18:15,696 --> 01:18:17,781
I'd hug you, but I'd
go right through-

1423
01:18:25,497 --> 01:18:27,916
Thank you... For her.

1424
01:18:35,632 --> 01:18:36,800
My god.

1425
01:18:36,842 --> 01:18:38,802
Come on, turn around.
Slowly.

1426
01:18:38,844 --> 01:18:41,722
Zac efron mall boy-
he found you.

1427
01:18:45,809 --> 01:18:48,812
My god.
What do I do?

1428
01:18:48,812 --> 01:18:50,564
You know what to do.

1429
01:18:51,815 --> 01:18:53,650
I do.

1430
01:18:55,819 --> 01:18:57,738
Now go.

1431
01:19:02,826 --> 01:19:04,661
I'll be looking
over you.

1432
01:19:16,507 --> 01:19:19,635
I have been to seven proms
tonight looking for you.

1433
01:19:20,803 --> 01:19:22,846
Man, you are...

1434
01:19:22,846 --> 01:19:24,848
So much hotter
than what I remember.

1435
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:26,767
I'm sorry. Um...

1436
01:19:26,809 --> 01:19:28,477
I don't want to
scare you again.

1437
01:19:28,519 --> 01:19:31,563
That scared girl is...

1438
01:19:31,605 --> 01:19:32,689
Gone.

1439
01:19:33,857 --> 01:19:35,400
Since you came
all this way,

1440
01:19:35,442 --> 01:19:36,527
You want to dance
or something?

1441
01:19:36,568 --> 01:19:37,778
God, yes.

1442
01:19:45,702 --> 01:19:48,413
So... Should I
say anything

1443
01:19:48,455 --> 01:19:49,790
About the really hot
prom outfit you've got on,

1444
01:19:49,832 --> 01:19:51,542
Or do I just continue
to ignore it?

1445
01:19:51,542 --> 01:19:52,876
Ignore it.

1446
01:19:52,918 --> 01:19:55,546
you got it.

1447
01:19:55,587 --> 01:19:57,548
All right, ashley high,
let's kick it up!

1448
01:20:03,554 --> 01:20:05,722
<i>And so, for
one brief, shining moment,</i>

1449
01:20:05,764 --> 01:20:08,559
<i>The high school universe
was upended,</i>

1450
01:20:08,559 --> 01:20:11,603
<i>And the least of them
became the best of them.</i>

1451
01:20:11,645 --> 01:20:12,896
<i>And for the rest of
the evening,</i>

1452
01:20:12,938 --> 01:20:14,731
<i>The walls came down.</i>

1453
01:20:26,577 --> 01:20:27,870
This is wrong!

1454
01:20:27,911 --> 01:20:29,580
This mixing-

1455
01:20:29,621 --> 01:20:31,582
It's completely wrong!

1456
01:20:31,623 --> 01:20:32,666
It's against nature!

1457
01:20:32,708 --> 01:20:34,626
Stop playing now!

1458
01:20:37,754 --> 01:20:40,716
I'm shutting
this whole thing down!

1459
01:20:46,972 --> 01:20:48,932
<i>lucky me.</i>

1460
01:20:48,932 --> 01:20:50,809
Here we go again.
