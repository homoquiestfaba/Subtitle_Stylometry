1
00:01:14,155 --> 00:01:15,322
Hey, ladies.

2
00:01:16,805 --> 00:01:18,181
Have a beautiful night.

3
00:01:18,205 --> 00:01:20,859
Thank you.

4
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:41,673
Another tequila, hon?

5
00:02:41,697 --> 00:02:42,942
Uh...

6
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:44,832
Come on, it's Patron!

7
00:02:44,856 --> 00:02:46,852
Sure, thanks.

8
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:48,042
Cheers!

9
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:49,342
Cheers.

10
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:51,022
So you're ridesharing?

11
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,642
Yeah. I don't even own a car.

12
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:53,692
Did you know those companies

13
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:55,762
are destroying the middle class?

14
00:02:55,786 --> 00:02:57,462
While the owners
line their pockets

15
00:02:57,486 --> 00:02:59,822
with millions of dollars?

16
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,122
Uh, no.

17
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:04,252
I just thought it was a
convenient way to get around town.

18
00:03:04,276 --> 00:03:05,502
Yeah, for you!

19
00:03:05,526 --> 00:03:07,372
But it's not so convenient
if you're a driver,

20
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:08,846
trying to make a living wage!

21
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,682
You know what? Cancel the ride.

22
00:03:12,706 --> 00:03:13,712
I'll take you home.

23
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:15,792
No, thanks.

24
00:03:15,816 --> 00:03:17,142
Of course.

25
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:20,002
These fucking rideshares
are the blight of humanity.

26
00:03:20,026 --> 00:03:23,652
Um, well, it was
nice meeting you.

27
00:03:23,676 --> 00:03:24,982
Hey!

28
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:27,242
I just bought you a $20 drink.

29
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:29,372
Why don't you sit down and
talk to me for five minutes?

30
00:03:29,396 --> 00:03:31,442
Hey, jerk! Leave her alone!

31
00:03:31,466 --> 00:03:32,516
You heard the lady.

32
00:03:33,386 --> 00:03:34,386
Fuckin' bitch.

33
00:03:35,998 --> 00:03:38,098
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good, thanks.

34
00:03:40,398 --> 00:03:42,082
Where did she find such a loser?

35
00:03:42,106 --> 00:03:43,106
Such a dick.

36
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,066
Hey, man. Your
picture was of a girl.

37
00:04:13,196 --> 00:04:15,062
Guess you thought by having
a picture of a hot chick,

38
00:04:15,086 --> 00:04:16,709
you'd get picked up faster, huh?

39
00:04:17,736 --> 00:04:19,162
Yeah, you're probably right,

40
00:04:19,186 --> 00:04:21,532
but I'm stilling giving
you bad feedback.

41
00:04:21,556 --> 00:04:23,342
How do you like that, asshole?

42
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:25,559
Fuckin' thumbs-down
for your lying ass.

43
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,182
Okay.

44
00:06:19,206 --> 00:06:20,828
Thanks for the ride.

45
00:06:20,852 --> 00:06:21,977
Bye.

46
00:07:18,586 --> 00:07:19,586
Oh!

47
00:07:21,786 --> 00:07:24,749
So does this outfit
radiate confident leader?

48
00:07:26,526 --> 00:07:29,269
Well, if you have to
ask, probably not.

49
00:07:30,526 --> 00:07:31,739
I know, right?

50
00:07:32,826 --> 00:07:33,929
Too much gray.

51
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,225
Yeah?

52
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:47,462
Are you ready to go?

53
00:07:47,486 --> 00:07:48,443
Can I go?

54
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:52,262
No one told you you
could talk, slave!

55
00:07:52,286 --> 00:07:54,382
And no, you can't go.

56
00:07:54,406 --> 00:07:55,882
Sorry, mistress.

57
00:07:55,906 --> 00:07:57,692
Give me like five minutes.

58
00:07:57,716 --> 00:07:58,716
Okay.

59
00:08:01,756 --> 00:08:03,156
Can you at least untie me?

60
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:08,009
In a few hours.

61
00:08:23,386 --> 00:08:26,242
So, what the fuck is
this shindig tonight?

62
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:27,412
It's a pre-IPO party

63
00:08:27,436 --> 00:08:30,082
for my overachieving
brother's company.

64
00:08:30,106 --> 00:08:31,592
Oh, fuck.

65
00:08:31,616 --> 00:08:34,542
A night with stuffy
white people.

66
00:08:34,566 --> 00:08:35,566
Probably.

67
00:08:41,376 --> 00:08:45,082
And you're dragging
me along because?

68
00:08:45,106 --> 00:08:48,892
Because my father invited
every rich person he knows,

69
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,809
and we need an investor for
Rock n Ride, like yesterday.

70
00:08:52,826 --> 00:08:55,002
So I gotta be nice, too?

71
00:08:55,026 --> 00:08:56,582
We all do.

72
00:08:56,606 --> 00:08:59,472
We need to go there and
see if anyone's interested.

73
00:08:59,496 --> 00:09:02,152
Collect cards, names.

74
00:09:02,176 --> 00:09:04,539
Then I'll follow up with
a formal pitch next week.

75
00:09:35,716 --> 00:09:38,069
Hey. Do you remember me?

76
00:09:39,326 --> 00:09:40,892
I'm not sure.

77
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,952
Billy Smith. We went to
high school together.

78
00:09:43,976 --> 00:09:45,202
Oh, yeah!

79
00:09:45,226 --> 00:09:47,342
Remember? We were in Miss
Dahlia's biology class?

80
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:48,842
We were lab partners?

81
00:09:48,866 --> 00:09:50,422
Of course.

82
00:09:50,446 --> 00:09:51,892
What have you been up to?

83
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,352
Uh, not much.

84
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:56,762
I heard you went into the army.

85
00:09:56,786 --> 00:09:59,642
-  Air Force.
- God, it fuckin' sucked.

86
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,102
One motherfucker fuckin' me over

87
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:03,239
after another motherfucker
fucks me over.

88
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,752
First I was driving
this cab for a while,

89
00:10:05,776 --> 00:10:08,382
I was picking people up
from the Beverly Hilton.

90
00:10:08,406 --> 00:10:10,282
I was just taking them
to the same places.

91
00:10:10,306 --> 00:10:11,842
Over and over again.

92
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:13,222
Back and forth.

93
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:17,085
You know, my life was just
like going in circles.

94
00:10:17,109 --> 00:10:18,992
I'm sorry to hear that.

95
00:10:19,016 --> 00:10:21,422
It's not your
fault or anything.

96
00:10:21,446 --> 00:10:22,446
Good.

97
00:10:23,246 --> 00:10:26,542
You know, I
just have to thank you,

98
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:28,102
for starting this company.

99
00:10:28,126 --> 00:10:33,126
It really has turned
my life around so much.

100
00:10:33,326 --> 00:10:35,132
Well, you're welcome.

101
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:36,712
It's not like
I'm stalking or anything.

102
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,822
I'm just following
you on Twitter.

103
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,346
Good, 'cause I was a
little scared for a second.

104
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:54,586
Thanks.

105
00:11:04,686 --> 00:11:05,982
Bad traffic?

106
00:11:06,006 --> 00:11:07,006
Hey, Dad.

107
00:11:08,186 --> 00:11:10,122
We'll call you over
when we need you.

108
00:11:10,146 --> 00:11:10,956
Okay.

109
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,148
Nice to see you, Mr. Altimari.

110
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,172
Stop.

111
00:11:17,863 --> 00:11:18,673
Thank you.

112
00:11:18,697 --> 00:11:21,532
I want you to meet Todd
Woodbridge and James Flayhaven.

113
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:24,309
Two heavy hitters with
billions to invest.

114
00:11:25,156 --> 00:11:27,292
Be careful what you
say to Flayhaven.

115
00:11:27,316 --> 00:11:30,722
He's invested heavily in
the tech taxi cab industry.

116
00:11:30,746 --> 00:11:32,522
I'll give him the
abridged pitch.

117
00:11:32,546 --> 00:11:33,619
Okay. Come on.

118
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,122
- Todd.
- Hey.

119
00:11:42,146 --> 00:11:43,322
James.

120
00:11:43,346 --> 00:11:46,382
I want you to meet
my daughter, Julia.

121
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:47,402
How you doin'?

122
00:11:47,426 --> 00:11:48,842
Very well, thank you.

123
00:11:48,866 --> 00:11:50,652
I hear you might be
looking for some additional

124
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,412
seed investors in your company.

125
00:11:52,436 --> 00:11:55,752
Well, yes, we are, but
we're a little concerned

126
00:11:55,776 --> 00:11:58,562
about your investment
in TaxiQuick.com?

127
00:11:58,586 --> 00:12:02,342
You've already done some due
diligence. I'm impressed.

128
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:03,502
We're good that way.

129
00:12:03,526 --> 00:12:05,356
I don't know which way
this thing is gonna break.

130
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,282
Ridesharing might
ultimately win out.

131
00:12:08,306 --> 00:12:11,452
But then again, the taxi
industry is adjusting

132
00:12:11,476 --> 00:12:13,109
and winning back a few markets.

133
00:12:14,596 --> 00:12:15,872
I just wanna make sure
I'm on the winning side,

134
00:12:15,896 --> 00:12:17,442
no matter what side wins.

135
00:12:17,466 --> 00:12:19,922
Okay, but how can we be sure?

136
00:12:19,946 --> 00:12:21,502
Take a meeting with me.

137
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:24,629
I'll sign any NDA you want
and bring my checkbook.

138
00:12:25,596 --> 00:12:27,972
I'm prepared to give you
a full round of funding.

139
00:12:27,996 --> 00:12:31,082
Well, that's a very
generous offer, James.

140
00:12:31,106 --> 00:12:32,442
Isn't it, Julia?

141
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:34,172
Almost too good to be true.

142
00:12:34,196 --> 00:12:36,182
I'll have my
assistant ring you tomorrow,

143
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:37,312
to set something up.

144
00:12:37,336 --> 00:12:39,012
That'd be great.

145
00:12:39,036 --> 00:12:40,952
The rideshare industry
is expected to grow

146
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:43,052
over 400 million in the next.

147
00:12:43,076 --> 00:12:45,702
There's no need for your pitch.

148
00:12:45,726 --> 00:12:47,652
I understand the market.

149
00:12:47,676 --> 00:12:49,432
I wanna get to know you better.

150
00:12:49,456 --> 00:12:52,272
I invest in people,
not companies.

151
00:12:52,296 --> 00:12:55,952
And this is our CTO,
Lorraine Barbour.

152
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:57,592
Hello.

153
00:12:57,616 --> 00:13:01,282
And this is our art director.

154
00:13:01,306 --> 00:13:03,583
Naomi McGuinea!

155
00:13:03,607 --> 00:13:05,972
- What up, peeps?

156
00:13:05,996 --> 00:13:07,144
Isn't she delightful?

157
00:13:13,586 --> 00:13:14,679
Julia.

158
00:13:18,096 --> 00:13:20,502
So, I've got one meeting set up.

159
00:13:20,526 --> 00:13:21,336
How you doin'?

160
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,463
Well, we're gettin'
a lot of interest.

161
00:13:23,487 --> 00:13:26,549
Of course you are. You've
built a fantastic company.

162
00:13:27,906 --> 00:13:28,906
Are you ready?

163
00:13:30,887 --> 00:13:32,442
I guess.

164
00:13:32,466 --> 00:13:33,842
Oh, come on.

165
00:13:33,866 --> 00:13:36,972
Dad's been grooming you for
this IPO since you were three.

166
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:40,279
Yeah. I think he's more
interested in it than I am.

167
00:13:40,303 --> 00:13:42,636
What're you doing? Get up!

168
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,572
Uh, he just gave
me a dirty look.

169
00:13:45,596 --> 00:13:47,762
Well, gotta get
back to schmoozing.

170
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:48,786
Ciao.

171
00:13:50,346 --> 00:13:51,346
There we go.

172
00:13:57,196 --> 00:13:58,196
Waiter.

173
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,622
No more for him.

174
00:14:00,646 --> 00:14:01,889
Of course, ma'am.

175
00:14:04,736 --> 00:14:07,342
Why don't you just go
work for your brother?

176
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:11,192
Get in now and you'll make
millions in a few months

177
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:13,592
when they get their IPO.

178
00:14:13,616 --> 00:14:17,542
My company is going to
do very well, thank you!

179
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:20,052
Of course. I didn't
mean it wasn't.

180
00:14:20,076 --> 00:14:21,762
It's just...

181
00:14:21,786 --> 00:14:23,159
His is a sure thing.

182
00:14:24,376 --> 00:14:26,552
I didn't empty my
Rolodex on this party

183
00:14:26,576 --> 00:14:28,522
so you could talk to each other.

184
00:14:28,546 --> 00:14:30,492
Go! Mingle!

185
00:14:30,516 --> 00:14:32,489
Meet another investor!

186
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,889
Yes, Dad.

187
00:14:46,704 --> 00:14:48,392
Oh, hey, Julia.

188
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,499
You have time for a
little due diligence?

189
00:14:52,366 --> 00:14:54,562
Sure. What would
you like to know?

190
00:14:54,586 --> 00:14:55,622
Are you married?

191
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:57,072
- No.
- Boyfriend?

192
00:14:57,096 --> 00:15:00,035
I'm a little too busy for
a serious relationship now.

193
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:04,172
So, you're open for a
casual relationship?

194
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:06,246
No, I don't have time
for that, either.

195
00:15:07,886 --> 00:15:08,696
How old were you when you had

196
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,602
your first sexual experience?

197
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:11,702
That's relevant, how?

198
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:13,682
I'm just trying
to get to know you better.

199
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:16,102
Well, I'm not gonna answer that.

200
00:15:16,126 --> 00:15:17,322
Any more questions?

201
00:15:17,346 --> 00:15:20,562
Clean shaven, landing
strip, or full-on bush?

202
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,782
Really? That's the
question you wanna ask me?

203
00:15:23,806 --> 00:15:26,552
Not where did I grow up or
where did I go to college,

204
00:15:26,576 --> 00:15:28,972
or what challenges I
think the business faces?

205
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:31,542
You grew up in Upstate New
York, you went to Stanford.

206
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:35,422
Right now, a lack of capital
is your biggest challenge.

207
00:15:35,446 --> 00:15:39,000
A problem I can help you with.

208
00:15:39,024 --> 00:15:42,082
Oh, congratulations. You've
done your due diligence.

209
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:45,359
Some of it, but I'd like
to do a little more.

210
00:15:45,383 --> 00:15:46,683
No, thank you.

211
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:50,102
Do you what difference
between successful people

212
00:15:50,126 --> 00:15:52,552
and unsuccessful people is?

213
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,392
Successful people
are willing to do

214
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,559
what unsuccessful
people simply aren't.

215
00:15:57,536 --> 00:15:59,062
Are you working to work
with a real son of a bitch

216
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:00,136
to save your company?

217
00:16:02,616 --> 00:16:03,616
Julia!

218
00:16:04,685 --> 00:16:07,421
I'm so sorry. I don't
know what got into her!

219
00:16:09,506 --> 00:16:12,919
Luckily I cryogenically froze
several billion of my sperm.

220
00:16:16,216 --> 00:16:19,212
What the
hell happened there?

221
00:16:19,236 --> 00:16:22,152
That creep sexually harassed me.

222
00:16:22,176 --> 00:16:23,632
He was probably just trying

223
00:16:23,656 --> 00:16:25,802
to get to know you a little bit.

224
00:16:25,826 --> 00:16:29,370
He asked me how I
shave my pubic hair.

225
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,040
Julia!

226
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:58,392
Hey.

227
00:17:56,072 --> 00:17:57,072
You okay?

228
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:01,792
We shouldn't have gone.

229
00:18:01,816 --> 00:18:03,309
It was my brother's party.

230
00:18:05,096 --> 00:18:07,979
And just one more thing for
my dad to criticize about me.

231
00:18:10,596 --> 00:18:12,695
Dad's wrong on this, okay?

232
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:16,202
That guy was a creep and
you did the right thing.

233
00:18:16,226 --> 00:18:17,226
I know.

234
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,642
I just wish they'd shut the
fuck up about my perfect

235
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,942
little brother and how fantastic
his company is, you know?

236
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:25,382
Yeah.

237
00:18:25,406 --> 00:18:26,826
He sucks.

238
00:19:02,048 --> 00:19:02,858
Um...

239
00:19:02,882 --> 00:19:04,062
Julia?

240
00:19:04,086 --> 00:19:06,286
I think you better come
take a look at this.

241
00:19:12,966 --> 00:19:14,329
What the fuck?

242
00:19:15,517 --> 00:19:17,232
That can't be real.

243
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,392
Well, we're gonna find out.

244
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,003
What is her number?

245
00:19:22,976 --> 00:19:23,976
Um, here.

246
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:31,962
The customer
you are trying to reach.

247
00:19:31,986 --> 00:19:33,271
Voicemail.

248
00:19:33,295 --> 00:19:35,439
Please leave
a message at the tone.

249
00:19:36,313 --> 00:19:37,512
Hi, Samantha.

250
00:19:37,536 --> 00:19:40,522
This is Julia Altimari
calling from Rock n Ride.

251
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,379
We just saw your
feedback from last night

252
00:19:42,403 --> 00:19:44,502
and we wanna talk
to you about it.

253
00:19:44,526 --> 00:19:45,912
With allegations this serious,

254
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:47,886
we're gonna have to
involve the police.

255
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:50,152
Call me back as
soon as possible.

256
00:19:50,176 --> 00:19:51,572
I'm calling you
from my cellphone.

257
00:19:51,596 --> 00:19:54,791
Please call me back on
this number. Thanks.

258
00:19:56,326 --> 00:19:58,191
Where was she dropped off?

259
00:20:00,856 --> 00:20:03,762
- Uh, Woodland Hills.
- About 10 miles from here.

260
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,462
Are we gonna call the police?

261
00:20:05,486 --> 00:20:07,436
We have to make sure
it's not a joke.

262
00:20:08,716 --> 00:20:11,112
Pull the driver so he
can't pick up anyone else.

263
00:20:11,136 --> 00:20:12,322
Got it.

264
00:20:15,476 --> 00:20:16,952
I'm goin' over there.

265
00:20:16,976 --> 00:20:18,319
You're doing what?

266
00:20:48,596 --> 00:20:49,596
Samantha?

267
00:20:50,546 --> 00:20:51,649
Are you here?

268
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:55,629
Call 911.

269
00:20:56,534 --> 00:20:57,875
Call 911!

270
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:00,699
Samantha!

271
00:21:01,686 --> 00:21:05,242
It's Julia Altimari from
Rock n Ride. Are you here?

272
00:21:05,266 --> 00:21:07,992
I think we should
wait for the police!

273
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,316
She might need our help!

274
00:21:23,566 --> 00:21:25,302
I think we should get
the hell out of here

275
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:27,192
and wait for the police!

276
00:21:27,216 --> 00:21:29,359
Samantha! Are you here?

277
00:21:45,977 --> 00:21:47,060
Oh, my god.

278
00:22:23,906 --> 00:22:24,906
Well?

279
00:22:25,696 --> 00:22:28,596
Well, she didn't post the
feedback when she was tied up.

280
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,216
Thank you, Captain Obvious.

281
00:22:33,346 --> 00:22:36,159
Obviously the killer
wanted her to be found.

282
00:22:37,796 --> 00:22:38,819
But why?

283
00:22:40,007 --> 00:22:43,507
Well, that's what we
have to figure out.

284
00:23:05,826 --> 00:23:07,252
Man.

285
00:23:07,276 --> 00:23:10,262
Wonder how a small startup
can afford a place like this.

286
00:23:10,286 --> 00:23:12,432
Actually, it's my house.

287
00:23:12,456 --> 00:23:14,732
I'm letting Rock n Ride use
it as their headquarters

288
00:23:14,756 --> 00:23:16,642
until they can move
into a proper office.

289
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:18,902
- And you are?
- I'm Reginald Altimari.

290
00:23:18,926 --> 00:23:21,012
- I'm chairman of the board.
- It's a pleasure.

291
00:23:21,036 --> 00:23:22,692
And you're Julia
Altimari's father, right?

292
00:23:22,716 --> 00:23:23,772
That's right.

293
00:23:23,796 --> 00:23:24,912
Figures.

294
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:27,686
No way a bunch of coeds could
afford a place like this.

295
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,152
You bringin' sexy back?

296
00:23:34,176 --> 00:23:35,359
Uh, no?

297
00:23:36,576 --> 00:23:37,576
Is Julia here?

298
00:23:50,146 --> 00:23:52,402
We found the driver
in a dumpster,

299
00:23:52,426 --> 00:23:53,919
about a mile from the club.

300
00:23:54,886 --> 00:23:57,242
What were you able to
find out about the driver?

301
00:23:57,266 --> 00:23:59,066
- Well, when I- -
Hold on a second.

302
00:24:00,236 --> 00:24:01,802
Should our lawyers be here?

303
00:24:01,826 --> 00:24:03,152
I don't think that's necessary.

304
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:06,292
Look, something like this,
it could sink our business.

305
00:24:06,316 --> 00:24:09,282
So, it has to be
handled carefully.

306
00:24:09,306 --> 00:24:11,492
I don't want this
leaking out to the media.

307
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:14,322
We're not in the habit
of leaking information.

308
00:24:14,346 --> 00:24:16,992
Yeah, right. Cops
never leak information.

309
00:24:17,016 --> 00:24:20,297
Two people are
dead. They're gone.

310
00:24:20,321 --> 00:24:23,512
They're not coming back and
your app was used to kill 'em.

311
00:24:23,536 --> 00:24:25,092
You don't know that!

312
00:24:25,116 --> 00:24:27,162
We all want the same thing, pal.

313
00:24:27,186 --> 00:24:28,083
Do we?

314
00:24:28,107 --> 00:24:29,869
Look, stop. Everyone.

315
00:24:30,756 --> 00:24:33,062
These two people deserve
all of our best efforts

316
00:24:33,086 --> 00:24:34,086
to get this guy.

317
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:37,156
We're happy to share
any information we have.

318
00:24:38,236 --> 00:24:39,342
Thank you.

319
00:24:39,366 --> 00:24:41,832
Now what do you
have on the driver?

320
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:44,242
Uh, nothing unusual.

321
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:45,952
He's done over 300 rides

322
00:24:45,976 --> 00:24:48,692
and his feedback
was all pretty good.

323
00:24:48,716 --> 00:24:50,422
He's picked up 14
people from that club

324
00:24:50,446 --> 00:24:52,102
in the last two weeks.

325
00:24:52,126 --> 00:24:54,102
Well, you guys know your
systems better than anybody else

326
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:57,232
so why don't you keep
thinking about the problem

327
00:24:57,256 --> 00:24:59,722
and see if you can come at
it from a different angle?

328
00:24:59,746 --> 00:25:01,369
And no matter how trivial
you think it might be,

329
00:25:01,393 --> 00:25:05,259
you let us know immediately
if you know anything, okay?

330
00:25:06,236 --> 00:25:07,236
Of course.

331
00:25:15,406 --> 00:25:17,992
This thing could not
only sink our business,

332
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,209
it could sink the
entire industry.

333
00:25:21,426 --> 00:25:22,892
You've gotta do
everything you can

334
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:26,302
to help the police catch
this son of a bitch quickly.

335
00:25:26,326 --> 00:25:29,539
But also, keep it as
private as possible.

336
00:25:30,626 --> 00:25:32,262
We will.

337
00:25:32,286 --> 00:25:34,222
If it's just one murder,

338
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:36,989
we could position it
as an anomaly, but,

339
00:25:38,306 --> 00:25:41,692
if it's a string murders,
there's no way to spin that.

340
00:25:41,716 --> 00:25:44,842
People would be too scared to
take even one of our rides.

341
00:25:44,866 --> 00:25:46,399
Believe me, I know.

342
00:25:48,136 --> 00:25:50,122
I'm giving you just enough money

343
00:25:50,146 --> 00:25:52,062
to get through another month.

344
00:25:52,086 --> 00:25:53,602
And then what?

345
00:25:53,626 --> 00:25:56,262
I'm gonna need you to
call James Flayhaven back

346
00:25:56,286 --> 00:25:58,522
and apologize.

347
00:25:58,546 --> 00:26:01,532
Apologize for being
sexually harassed?

348
00:26:01,556 --> 00:26:04,152
He's the only person that
showed even a remote interest

349
00:26:04,176 --> 00:26:06,202
in investing in your company!

350
00:26:06,226 --> 00:26:07,776
Well, I don't wanna call him!

351
00:26:11,076 --> 00:26:12,076
Julia!

352
00:26:13,566 --> 00:26:17,422
I invested in your company,
because you told me

353
00:26:17,446 --> 00:26:20,372
that you would do whatever it
takes to make this thing work.

354
00:26:20,396 --> 00:26:24,782
Well, now is the time
to do whatever it takes.

355
00:26:24,806 --> 00:26:27,862
Well, I think it's time
to pivot the company.

356
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,469
Pivot? To what?

357
00:26:30,336 --> 00:26:33,312
What about a rideshare
for women only?

358
00:26:33,336 --> 00:26:35,392
Women passengers, women drivers.

359
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:36,692
No men.

360
00:26:36,716 --> 00:26:39,582
How many of our
rides are only women?

361
00:26:39,606 --> 00:26:41,476
About 10%.

362
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,159
So, you literally wanna
cut our sales by 90%?

363
00:26:46,326 --> 00:26:49,212
Come on. You're
smarter than this.

364
00:26:49,236 --> 00:26:51,202
Women would feel safe.

365
00:26:51,226 --> 00:26:52,812
We could cut into
the bigger companies'

366
00:26:52,836 --> 00:26:54,832
market shares and stand out!

367
00:26:54,856 --> 00:26:58,172
Nobody is going
to invest in that!

368
00:26:58,196 --> 00:27:01,092
Look, your business
needs a market cap

369
00:27:01,116 --> 00:27:05,402
of at least a billion
dollars, not 10% of a billion.

370
00:27:05,426 --> 00:27:06,403
Well, would you consider

371
00:27:06,427 --> 00:27:09,829
I'm going to need
you to call James!

372
00:27:10,776 --> 00:27:12,609
I'm not going to call him!

373
00:27:14,236 --> 00:27:15,822
Fine.

374
00:27:15,846 --> 00:27:17,142
Okay!

375
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:18,902
You're the CEO.

376
00:27:18,926 --> 00:27:21,272
But you're gonna have
to go back in there

377
00:27:21,296 --> 00:27:25,662
and fire your friends, because
if you are not committed

378
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:27,922
to making this
company a success,

379
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:31,959
then I am not committed to
throwing any more money at it.

380
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:36,642
Well, I am going to
explore other options,

381
00:27:36,666 --> 00:27:40,239
and if nothing pans out in
a month, then I'll call him!

382
00:27:43,866 --> 00:27:47,009
Well, I'm glad to see you got
your head screwed back on!

383
00:28:03,836 --> 00:28:05,482
Say, are you
one of the head honchos

384
00:28:05,506 --> 00:28:06,529
at Rock n Ride?

385
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:10,092
I'm on the board, if
that's what you mean.

386
00:28:10,116 --> 00:28:12,482
That's exactly what I mean.

387
00:28:12,506 --> 00:28:14,962
You know, I think it's
fantastic what you're doing.

388
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:18,412
Creating millions of jobs
with scheduling flexibility.

389
00:28:18,436 --> 00:28:21,512
All while bringing the
consumer an amazing product.

390
00:28:21,536 --> 00:28:24,482
Maybe we should hire
you as our pitch man.

391
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:26,259
Well, I'm absolutely available.

392
00:29:02,716 --> 00:29:04,275
I'll get it.

393
00:29:12,318 --> 00:29:17,318
Hello?

394
00:29:18,169 --> 00:29:19,169
Hello?

395
00:29:20,369 --> 00:29:21,702
Is anyone there?

396
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:39,562
Who was it?

397
00:29:39,586 --> 00:29:40,639
Nobody was there.

398
00:29:45,656 --> 00:29:47,172
Oh, shit.

399
00:29:47,196 --> 00:29:49,099
There's someone in the backyard.

400
00:29:53,146 --> 00:29:54,146
What're you doing?

401
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:05,452
Wow.

402
00:30:05,476 --> 00:30:06,812
Where did you get that?

403
00:30:06,836 --> 00:30:11,312
I keep it under the table,
in case of emergencies.

404
00:30:11,336 --> 00:30:12,336
Good thinking.

405
00:30:13,941 --> 00:30:14,941
What?

406
00:30:28,276 --> 00:30:29,912
Hey, motherfucker!

407
00:30:29,936 --> 00:30:33,679
I got a big-ass machete
here, with your name on it!

408
00:30:42,199 --> 00:30:44,949
- Whoa!

409
00:30:46,069 --> 00:30:47,892
Fuck.

410
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:49,469
- Really?
- Do you know him?

411
00:30:50,456 --> 00:30:52,312
Unfortunately.

412
00:30:52,336 --> 00:30:55,692
What the hell are you doing
creeping around our backyard?

413
00:30:55,716 --> 00:30:58,102
I rang the bell.
No one answered.

414
00:30:58,126 --> 00:30:59,482
Hey, fuck wad!

415
00:30:59,506 --> 00:31:03,529
You know you're allowed to
kill someone who trespasses.

416
00:31:05,266 --> 00:31:08,989
Maybe in 1876 Texas, but not
in modern-day California.

417
00:31:10,596 --> 00:31:12,232
What do you want?

418
00:31:12,256 --> 00:31:15,332
I'm writing a fair and balanced
article about Rock n Ride.

419
00:31:15,356 --> 00:31:17,412
Oh, of course you are.

420
00:31:17,436 --> 00:31:20,032
I was hoping I can get
an interview with you.

421
00:31:20,056 --> 00:31:21,469
Absolutely not.

422
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:28,062
I got a tip one of
your drivers killed a girl.

423
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:29,086
Who told you that?

424
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:32,509
I can't reveal my
source, but it's true.

425
00:31:33,456 --> 00:31:34,423
Isn't it?

426
00:31:34,447 --> 00:31:36,612
Look, don't fuck with me again.

427
00:31:36,636 --> 00:31:39,712
This company has legs and I
don't want you ruining it!

428
00:31:39,736 --> 00:31:41,372
Who the fuck are you?

429
00:31:41,396 --> 00:31:44,702
I'm Rohan Patel, publisher
of ShittyStartup.com.

430
00:31:44,726 --> 00:31:45,732
Nice to meet you.

431
00:31:45,756 --> 00:31:48,759
He also single handedly
fucked Julia's other startups.

432
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:52,502
Yeah, we had a thing in college.

433
00:31:52,526 --> 00:31:53,552
I thought it was so sweet

434
00:31:53,576 --> 00:31:56,422
that he was putting his
number into my contacts,

435
00:31:56,446 --> 00:31:58,372
but then when I
called the next day,

436
00:31:58,396 --> 00:32:00,142
it was an abortion clinic.

437
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:01,802
What a dick!

438
00:32:01,826 --> 00:32:03,526
Hey, that wasn't my best moment.

439
00:32:04,386 --> 00:32:06,272
Did I ever apologize for that?

440
00:32:06,296 --> 00:32:07,296
No.

441
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:13,422
Hey, if you change your
mind about the interview,

442
00:32:13,446 --> 00:32:14,746
you know where to find me.

443
00:32:43,806 --> 00:32:46,222
Thank you for sitting
in the front seat.

444
00:32:46,246 --> 00:32:49,082
It's about damn time
someone sat up here with me.

445
00:32:49,106 --> 00:32:53,139
Most of the time, people just
hop in the back and ignore me.

446
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:05,566
You're sure this is a shortcut?

447
00:33:47,686 --> 00:33:49,182
Have we really done
everything we can

448
00:33:49,206 --> 00:33:50,659
to protect our customers?

449
00:33:52,673 --> 00:33:55,519
I mean, we could always do more.

450
00:33:57,266 --> 00:34:00,079
You know, my dad kept
telling us to grow quickly,

451
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:03,312
but maybe that was a mistake.

452
00:34:03,336 --> 00:34:04,929
Maybe we should grow slow.

453
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:09,079
Maybe our protocol
isn't good enough.

454
00:34:10,076 --> 00:34:12,049
I mean, what could we have done?

455
00:34:13,016 --> 00:34:17,812
Some psychopath picks up a
driver, kills them, gets a rider.

456
00:34:17,836 --> 00:34:19,436
Let's try to solve this thing.

457
00:34:20,426 --> 00:34:21,426
Okay.

458
00:34:22,856 --> 00:34:25,549
How do you think Rohan
found out about the murder?

459
00:34:27,702 --> 00:34:30,275
I don't know.

460
00:34:30,299 --> 00:34:33,622
I don't think the police told
him after the talk we had.

461
00:34:33,646 --> 00:34:34,652
Me neither.

462
00:34:34,676 --> 00:34:36,082
And none of us
would have told him.

463
00:34:36,106 --> 00:34:37,832
Absolutely not.

464
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:41,092
So the only person that
could know about the murder

465
00:34:41,116 --> 00:34:42,449
would be the killer.

466
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:45,116
Yeah.

467
00:34:45,856 --> 00:34:47,759
But why would he tell Rohan?

468
00:34:48,826 --> 00:34:50,909
To get press for the murder.

469
00:34:52,206 --> 00:34:53,672
Okay.

470
00:34:53,696 --> 00:34:54,696
Why?

471
00:34:55,736 --> 00:34:57,286
Maybe to destroy our company.

472
00:34:58,236 --> 00:34:59,709
Again, why?

473
00:35:00,846 --> 00:35:04,342
The killer must have
visited the club, right?

474
00:35:04,366 --> 00:35:05,392
Maybe.

475
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:07,216
To get familiar
with the location.

476
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:09,922
To plan the murder.

477
00:35:09,946 --> 00:35:10,853
Okay.

478
00:35:10,877 --> 00:35:12,962
Maybe he just made that call

479
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:14,836
to see how everything
would play out.

480
00:35:17,336 --> 00:35:20,987
How many people have been picked
up from that club recently?

481
00:35:23,946 --> 00:35:27,019
At least half a dozen,
almost every day.

482
00:35:28,256 --> 00:35:29,842
Holy fuck!

483
00:35:29,866 --> 00:35:31,492
What?

484
00:35:31,516 --> 00:35:33,082
Print that out for me.

485
00:35:33,106 --> 00:35:34,149
What? What is it?

486
00:35:37,146 --> 00:35:39,622
Yeah, Dad. Yeah.

487
00:35:39,646 --> 00:35:41,596
No, I've got some
leads for the police.

488
00:35:42,436 --> 00:35:45,322
No, no, no. No, I'm walking
it over there myself.

489
00:35:45,346 --> 00:35:46,346
Okay, bye.

490
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:49,022
Do you really think
it's a good idea

491
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:50,639
to take one of our own rides?

492
00:35:51,476 --> 00:35:53,042
I'm the fucking CEO.

493
00:35:53,066 --> 00:35:54,342
If I'm not gonna use my service,

494
00:35:54,366 --> 00:35:55,966
how do I expect anybody else to?

495
00:35:56,996 --> 00:35:59,562
You're not creeped out at all?

496
00:35:59,586 --> 00:36:01,852
Of course not, even if there
is a serial killer out there,

497
00:36:01,876 --> 00:36:05,649
using our app, what are the
odds of him picking us up?

498
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:49,249
So, what you got?

499
00:37:50,876 --> 00:37:53,202
These three men were picked
up by one of our drivers,

500
00:37:53,226 --> 00:37:56,562
from the same club, numerous
times, in the last month.

501
00:37:56,586 --> 00:37:57,892
Really?

502
00:37:57,916 --> 00:38:00,782
I don't recognize him, but
he's been picked up nine times

503
00:38:00,806 --> 00:38:01,806
in the last month.

504
00:38:02,856 --> 00:38:05,752
We'll talk to this guy, ASAP.

505
00:38:05,776 --> 00:38:07,112
I went to high school with him.

506
00:38:07,136 --> 00:38:09,212
He took us to a party on Friday.

507
00:38:09,236 --> 00:38:10,952
That's one hell
of a coincidence.

508
00:38:10,976 --> 00:38:11,923
Yeah and I caught this one

509
00:38:11,947 --> 00:38:14,362
creepin' around in
my backyard tonight.

510
00:38:14,386 --> 00:38:16,159
Rohan Patel?

511
00:38:17,006 --> 00:38:18,432
What did he want?

512
00:38:18,456 --> 00:38:20,772
He said he couldn't
reveal his source,

513
00:38:20,796 --> 00:38:22,422
but he knew about the murder.

514
00:38:22,446 --> 00:38:23,639
Why do you have pictures
of the two of them,

515
00:38:23,663 --> 00:38:26,102
but not this Rohan Patel guy?

516
00:38:26,126 --> 00:38:28,312
Well, we only have
pictures of our drivers

517
00:38:28,336 --> 00:38:29,812
and the first two
have driven for us,

518
00:38:29,836 --> 00:38:31,809
whereas Rohan's only
been a passenger.

519
00:38:33,516 --> 00:38:35,282
It's really good work.

520
00:38:35,306 --> 00:38:36,869
We will follow up on this.

521
00:38:39,006 --> 00:38:40,782
Thanks for a great date night.

522
00:38:40,806 --> 00:38:41,616
You're welcome.

523
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,461
It's not over yet.

524
00:38:43,485 --> 00:38:46,946
Mm, I like the sound
of that.

525
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:20,269
Stop! He's gonna kick us out.

526
00:39:20,293 --> 00:39:21,939
It'll be the
highlight of his week.

527
00:39:33,486 --> 00:39:35,122
Yo, driver.

528
00:39:35,146 --> 00:39:37,840
Aren't you supposed to give
us some free water and gum?

529
00:39:40,373 --> 00:39:42,388
Help! Help!

530
00:40:46,926 --> 00:40:49,402
Yeah, I go to that
club all the time.

531
00:40:49,426 --> 00:40:50,602
They let babes in for free,

532
00:40:50,626 --> 00:40:52,376
so it's always
packed with hotties.

533
00:40:53,236 --> 00:40:54,269
You recognize her?

534
00:40:58,046 --> 00:40:59,942
Nope. Never seen her.

535
00:40:59,966 --> 00:41:01,572
Really?

536
00:41:01,596 --> 00:41:02,596
Take a closer look.

537
00:41:08,476 --> 00:41:09,852
Oh, yeah.

538
00:41:09,876 --> 00:41:11,272
Her.

539
00:41:11,296 --> 00:41:12,732
I met her Saturday.

540
00:41:12,756 --> 00:41:13,809
You mean Sunday.

541
00:41:15,086 --> 00:41:15,953
Could've been.

542
00:41:15,977 --> 00:41:17,862
This picture was
taken on Sunday.

543
00:41:17,886 --> 00:41:20,732
Whatever. I talked to her
for like five seconds.

544
00:41:20,756 --> 00:41:22,392
She was a bitch.

545
00:41:22,416 --> 00:41:24,392
What did you do after she left?

546
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:26,186
I went home, I went to bed.

547
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:27,898
Can anyone verify that?

548
00:41:30,306 --> 00:41:31,669
If this girl's missing,

549
00:41:32,696 --> 00:41:34,496
I don't have anything
to do with it.

550
00:41:35,616 --> 00:41:37,892
Can anybody corroborate
your whereabouts

551
00:41:37,916 --> 00:41:40,282
on Sunday night around midnight?

552
00:41:40,306 --> 00:41:41,406
I don't know. Maybe.

553
00:41:42,486 --> 00:41:45,349
I went home, I went
to bed. I live alone.

554
00:41:46,316 --> 00:41:48,716
I didn't talk to anybody.
Maybe somebody saw me.

555
00:42:26,166 --> 00:42:28,499
So, she's the
girl who got killed.

556
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:32,092
We're the ones asking
the questions, pal.

557
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:33,616
Who told you about the girl?

558
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:37,252
I wouldn't tell you the
source, even if I knew.

559
00:42:37,276 --> 00:42:38,276
But I don't.

560
00:42:40,346 --> 00:42:41,662
I got an anonymous call saying

561
00:42:41,686 --> 00:42:43,686
that a Rock n Ride
driver killed a girl.

562
00:42:44,946 --> 00:42:47,082
That's all I'm gonna tell you.

563
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,612
Why were you at the
club on Sunday night?

564
00:42:49,636 --> 00:42:52,112
So she was there, wasn't she?

565
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:55,462
We're the ones asking
the questions, asshole.

566
00:42:55,486 --> 00:42:57,392
Why were you at the club?

567
00:42:57,416 --> 00:42:58,702
Same tipster called me.

568
00:42:58,726 --> 00:43:01,639
He said he was gonna be
there, but he never showed up.

569
00:43:19,758 --> 00:43:22,478
Hey. How are you this evening?

570
00:43:29,946 --> 00:43:30,946
I don't know her.

571
00:43:31,761 --> 00:43:33,692
Have you ever seen her before?

572
00:43:33,716 --> 00:43:35,022
No.

573
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:37,196
Why were you at the
club on Sunday night?

574
00:43:38,636 --> 00:43:40,102
I was just hanging out.

575
00:43:40,126 --> 00:43:41,209
You go there often?

576
00:43:42,106 --> 00:43:43,699
I've been there a few times.

577
00:43:45,646 --> 00:43:48,899
We need you to hang in
town until further notice.

578
00:43:51,156 --> 00:43:52,156
Okay.

579
00:44:07,777 --> 00:44:09,112
Hey! What up, slut?

580
00:44:09,136 --> 00:44:11,992
What the fuck are
you doing out here?

581
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:14,172
I heard there was another
murder last night.

582
00:44:14,196 --> 00:44:15,742
There was not.

583
00:44:15,766 --> 00:44:18,462
My source tells me there was.

584
00:44:18,486 --> 00:44:20,012
Do you realize that
the only person

585
00:44:20,036 --> 00:44:23,142
that could tell you that
information is the murderer?

586
00:44:23,166 --> 00:44:24,299
Or the police.

587
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:27,032
They have no need
to feed information

588
00:44:27,056 --> 00:44:29,342
to a shitty tech blogger.

589
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:30,472
Maybe.

590
00:44:30,496 --> 00:44:32,032
Maybe not.

591
00:44:32,056 --> 00:44:34,572
Have you considered
why this murderer

592
00:44:34,596 --> 00:44:36,742
wants to give you
all this information?

593
00:44:36,766 --> 00:44:39,622
Maybe because he's a
fan of great journalism.

594
00:44:39,646 --> 00:44:41,809
Oh, so your source is a man?

595
00:44:42,869 --> 00:44:44,349
I didn't say that.

596
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:48,152
Well, he knew we had history,

597
00:44:48,176 --> 00:44:50,592
and he knew you'd take the bait.

598
00:44:50,616 --> 00:44:52,472
He wants you to write this story

599
00:44:52,496 --> 00:44:55,082
and you are being
played like a fiddle.

600
00:44:55,106 --> 00:44:57,512
And if the police
don't catch this guy,

601
00:44:57,536 --> 00:45:01,602
sooner or later, he'll have
no use for you, either.

602
00:45:01,626 --> 00:45:04,279
You will be a loose end
that needs to be tied up.

603
00:45:05,306 --> 00:45:07,092
You're not going to scare me.

604
00:45:07,116 --> 00:45:09,919
If you're not scared,
then you're the murderer.

605
00:45:47,466 --> 00:45:49,152
There's been more murders.

606
00:45:49,176 --> 00:45:50,712
What?

607
00:45:50,736 --> 00:45:53,792
A driver was killed and
then the killer picked up

608
00:45:53,816 --> 00:45:56,929
three rides and killed them all.

609
00:45:57,886 --> 00:46:00,122
Let me see what I can find out.

610
00:46:00,146 --> 00:46:02,512
What was the name of the driver?

611
00:46:02,536 --> 00:46:03,699
Michelle Lindholm.

612
00:46:05,546 --> 00:46:06,809
I gotta talk to my dad.

613
00:46:11,608 --> 00:46:12,585
Okay.

614
00:46:12,609 --> 00:46:14,162
What're you looking for?

615
00:46:14,186 --> 00:46:16,492
I'm gonna cross-reference
the first list of suspects

616
00:46:16,516 --> 00:46:18,132
from the club with anyone
who's gotten a ride

617
00:46:18,156 --> 00:46:19,756
from one of these new locations.

618
00:46:21,066 --> 00:46:22,066
Smart.

619
00:46:23,536 --> 00:46:25,662
Oh, shit!

620
00:46:25,686 --> 00:46:28,072
That's the guy who
drove us to the party

621
00:46:28,096 --> 00:46:29,082
the other day, right?

622
00:46:29,106 --> 00:46:30,252
Yeah.

623
00:46:30,276 --> 00:46:31,086
Yeah.

624
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:32,529
Is he driving anyone now?

625
00:46:33,376 --> 00:46:34,992
Yes.

626
00:46:38,466 --> 00:46:39,909
Oh, my god. He's got Julia.

627
00:46:42,606 --> 00:46:43,712
Hi, Julia.

628
00:46:46,556 --> 00:46:49,882
Billy. I am so glad to
see that you're my driver.

629
00:46:49,906 --> 00:46:52,962
- Why is that?

630
00:46:52,986 --> 00:46:54,279
It's a long story.

631
00:46:56,556 --> 00:47:00,129
Um, I forgot something.
I'll be right back, okay?

632
00:47:02,426 --> 00:47:04,042
Yeah, that sometimes gets stuck.

633
00:47:04,066 --> 00:47:06,066
Wait, wait, wait.
You're gonna break it.

634
00:47:12,957 --> 00:47:13,782
You have to.

635
00:47:13,806 --> 00:47:16,638
Get away from her, motherfucker!

636
00:47:32,443 --> 00:47:34,276
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

637
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:36,666
What happened?

638
00:48:14,935 --> 00:48:17,018
- Check that out.
- Right.

639
00:48:40,816 --> 00:48:41,816
Bingo.

640
00:48:56,606 --> 00:48:57,606
Ladies.

641
00:49:01,466 --> 00:49:02,869
We searched his apartment.

642
00:49:04,406 --> 00:49:07,499
We found the drivers
licenses of the victims.

643
00:49:09,226 --> 00:49:11,352
But he didn't seem
like the type.

644
00:49:11,376 --> 00:49:12,722
No.

645
00:49:12,746 --> 00:49:14,282
They never do.

646
00:49:14,306 --> 00:49:16,049
But he fits the profile to a T.

647
00:49:17,096 --> 00:49:20,969
He's a loner, high IQ
and socially awkward.

648
00:49:22,196 --> 00:49:24,082
He was dishonorably
discharged from the marines

649
00:49:24,106 --> 00:49:25,729
for allegedly raping a girl.

650
00:49:26,846 --> 00:49:28,239
Textbook sociopath.

651
00:49:29,406 --> 00:49:30,882
Turn the app off.

652
00:49:30,906 --> 00:49:33,642
I don't want any more rides
until we figure this out.

653
00:49:33,666 --> 00:49:35,392
It's probably a good idea.

654
00:49:35,416 --> 00:49:36,566
I'll do it right now.

655
00:49:39,346 --> 00:49:42,192
And ladies, we're gonna have
a police officer here 24/7

656
00:49:42,216 --> 00:49:44,332
to look after you until
this blows over, okay?

657
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,356
Thank you.

658
00:49:50,916 --> 00:49:52,032
I miss you too, baby,

659
00:49:52,056 --> 00:49:54,897
but Mommy's gonna have to
tuck you in tonight, okay?

660
00:49:54,921 --> 00:49:56,127
And...

661
00:49:57,906 --> 00:49:59,529
I have to go. I'll
call you back.

662
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:53,042
Would you like
to make a statement

663
00:50:53,066 --> 00:50:53,876
about the murders?

664
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,822
Ma'am, I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

665
00:50:55,846 --> 00:50:57,272
Not at this time.

666
00:50:57,296 --> 00:50:59,046
How many murders
have there been?

667
00:51:07,166 --> 00:51:09,312
How did she know
about the murders?

668
00:51:09,336 --> 00:51:12,142
Rohan published the
scoop this morning.

669
00:51:12,166 --> 00:51:15,319
God damn it. My dad
is gonna be so pissed.

670
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:17,673
Yeah.

671
00:51:34,196 --> 00:51:36,772
Bring the reporters
up to the courtyard.

672
00:51:36,796 --> 00:51:37,796
Yes, sir.

673
00:51:42,676 --> 00:51:46,042
You're gonna have to go out
there and make a statement.

674
00:51:46,066 --> 00:51:47,219
What am I gonna say?

675
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,169
You make yourself the victim.

676
00:51:52,076 --> 00:51:54,832
You tell them that this guy
harassed you in high school

677
00:51:54,856 --> 00:51:57,222
and that he's a
deranged lunatic.

678
00:51:57,246 --> 00:52:00,112
And you make it clear that

679
00:52:00,136 --> 00:52:02,949
we're not liable
for any of this.

680
00:52:04,596 --> 00:52:06,582
Julia? I'm talking to you.

681
00:52:06,606 --> 00:52:08,612
I don't even know
if Billy did it.

682
00:52:08,636 --> 00:52:12,782
Well, the police think he's
guilty and so do we, okay?

683
00:52:12,806 --> 00:52:14,732
Well, I don't know!

684
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,252
Listen to me.

685
00:52:16,276 --> 00:52:19,212
The only chance that this
app stands of surviving

686
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:24,142
is if you make it clear that
this lunatic was an aberration.

687
00:52:24,166 --> 00:52:25,166
And...

688
00:52:25,846 --> 00:52:27,712
This whole thing,

689
00:52:27,736 --> 00:52:31,559
it has nothing to do with any
of our policies or procedures.

690
00:52:32,876 --> 00:52:33,876
Julia.

691
00:52:34,676 --> 00:52:38,482
You have a fiduciary
duty to your investors.

692
00:52:38,506 --> 00:52:40,939
Do not get all emotional on me.

693
00:52:50,616 --> 00:52:52,882
As you know, there have
been several murders

694
00:52:52,906 --> 00:52:54,642
in the past few days.

695
00:52:54,666 --> 00:52:56,042
The police have a suspect

696
00:52:56,066 --> 00:52:58,752
and are confident that
they'll catch him very soon.

697
00:52:58,776 --> 00:53:00,982
This is someone that I
went to high school with,

698
00:53:01,006 --> 00:53:03,962
who apparently was
obsessed with me.

699
00:53:03,986 --> 00:53:07,809
He was a deranged lunatic with
some sort of mental illness.

700
00:53:08,966 --> 00:53:11,612
We're working with the police
and doing everything we can

701
00:53:11,636 --> 00:53:14,292
to help catch him, but
as an added precaution,

702
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:18,492
we've taken the app offline,
until the killer is caught.

703
00:53:18,516 --> 00:53:19,802
When was the last
time you had sex

704
00:53:19,826 --> 00:53:21,126
with the rideshare killer?

705
00:53:22,416 --> 00:53:24,389
I was never intimate with him.

706
00:53:25,276 --> 00:53:27,072
I knew him in high school.

707
00:53:27,096 --> 00:53:28,482
We never dated.

708
00:53:28,506 --> 00:53:31,582
Could I have a word
with you, privately?

709
00:53:31,606 --> 00:53:33,886
Actually, I was just leaving.

710
00:53:48,556 --> 00:53:50,809
You did a good job
tonight, slave.

711
00:53:51,945 --> 00:53:53,622
Thanks.

712
00:53:53,646 --> 00:53:55,312
So, um...

713
00:53:55,336 --> 00:53:58,442
I was thinking maybe
we could do like dinner

714
00:53:58,466 --> 00:53:59,812
and maybe a movie, or something?

715
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:00,836
No.

716
00:54:02,596 --> 00:54:03,612
Okay, but why.

717
00:54:03,636 --> 00:54:05,959
You're not my boyfriend!
Don't ruin it.

718
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:17,486
Yeah.

719
00:54:22,166 --> 00:54:24,066
Hey, ma'am, did you
call for a ride?

720
00:54:25,086 --> 00:54:26,063
Come on, sweet lips!

721
00:54:26,087 --> 00:54:28,286
I don't have all day
to watch you suck face!

722
00:54:35,766 --> 00:54:37,352
When can I see you again?

723
00:54:37,376 --> 00:54:39,812
When I ask you out!

724
00:54:39,836 --> 00:54:42,182
No, okay? That doesn't
work for me anymore.

725
00:54:42,206 --> 00:54:43,542
Okay!

726
00:54:43,566 --> 00:54:46,492
You can call me and ask me out.

727
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:48,819
But we're goin' on no date.

728
00:54:51,206 --> 00:54:52,979
No! That is not what I meant.

729
00:55:04,716 --> 00:55:08,012
So, I noticed we're goin'
to that Rock n Ride house.

730
00:55:08,036 --> 00:55:09,642
You work for them?

731
00:55:09,666 --> 00:55:11,166
I'm their creative director.

732
00:55:12,076 --> 00:55:13,432
Yeah, you know, I used
to drive for that app,

733
00:55:13,456 --> 00:55:16,032
until they shut it
down temporarily.

734
00:55:16,056 --> 00:55:18,002
A little warning
would've been nice.

735
00:55:18,026 --> 00:55:19,299
Okay. Sorry.

736
00:55:20,466 --> 00:55:22,292
Is it too forward of me to ask

737
00:55:22,316 --> 00:55:23,966
what your relationship
status is?

738
00:55:24,886 --> 00:55:27,842
Well, that kid back
there isn't my boyfriend,

739
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,316
if that's what you're asking.

740
00:55:30,206 --> 00:55:31,856
That's exactly what I'm asking.

741
00:55:32,956 --> 00:55:34,162
How old are you?

742
00:55:34,186 --> 00:55:35,106
29.

743
00:55:37,916 --> 00:55:39,372
Yeah.

744
00:55:39,396 --> 00:55:41,469
Right.

745
00:55:42,326 --> 00:55:43,326
It's cool.

746
00:55:44,081 --> 00:55:45,149
I'm 29, too.

747
00:55:46,016 --> 00:55:48,612
With the recent revelation
that a serial killer has

748
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:51,212
murdered both riders and
drivers at the ridesharing

749
00:55:51,236 --> 00:55:55,252
company Rock n Ride, the
entire sector has taken a hit.

750
00:55:55,276 --> 00:55:58,292
All major ride companies'
stocks have plummeted,

751
00:55:58,316 --> 00:56:00,752
resulting in nearly
a 75% loss of value

752
00:56:00,776 --> 00:56:03,552
in the last few
hours of trading.

753
00:56:03,576 --> 00:56:05,103
I'm Erin Rogers and
this is channel...

754
00:56:20,693 --> 00:56:23,982
Do you really think
Billy is the killer?

755
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:25,452
You don't?

756
00:56:25,476 --> 00:56:26,476
No.

757
00:56:27,246 --> 00:56:30,759
I mean, Billy's weird,
but he wasn't a killer.

758
00:56:32,521 --> 00:56:34,462
I mean, why would he have
been in both locations

759
00:56:34,486 --> 00:56:35,686
where people got killed?

760
00:56:36,566 --> 00:56:37,809
Maybe he was lured.

761
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:42,242
I mean, the killer got
Rohan to the first location.

762
00:56:42,266 --> 00:56:43,266
What about Rohan?

763
00:56:45,306 --> 00:56:48,119
Rohan is a son of a bitch.

764
00:56:50,176 --> 00:56:52,619
But could he really
be the killer?

765
00:56:58,116 --> 00:57:00,932
Can you email me everything
we have on Billy?

766
00:57:00,956 --> 00:57:05,019
His resume, his application,
his feedback, his driver logs.

767
00:57:05,886 --> 00:57:08,242
I wanna see everything
we have on him.

768
00:57:08,266 --> 00:57:09,266
Sure.

769
00:57:10,116 --> 00:57:12,092
Now I'm gonna take
a couple Ambien,

770
00:57:12,116 --> 00:57:13,899
because I haven't slept in days.

771
00:57:14,839 --> 00:57:17,145
Okay. I'll see you
in the morning.

772
00:57:17,169 --> 00:57:18,836
Goodnight.

773
00:58:12,686 --> 00:58:14,299
How can I help you, sir?

774
00:58:15,146 --> 00:58:17,569
I need a
girl. Someone new?

775
00:58:18,585 --> 00:58:21,479
Yes, sir. I have
Sarah, but she's 800 an hour.

776
00:58:22,456 --> 00:58:24,992
Does she liked to be
slapped around a little bit?

777
00:58:25,016 --> 00:58:27,352
Yes, sir. She does.

778
00:58:27,376 --> 00:58:29,276
All right. Send her over.

779
00:59:49,089 --> 00:59:50,662
911.
What's your emergency?

780
00:59:50,686 --> 00:59:53,542
There's a fuckin' serial
killer in my house!

781
00:59:53,566 --> 00:59:55,400
Is he armed, sir?

782
00:59:55,424 --> 00:59:56,929
I don't know. Probably.

783
00:59:57,866 --> 01:00:00,442
Please,
stay calm, sir.

784
01:00:00,466 --> 01:00:01,616
Please send somebody!

785
01:00:03,096 --> 01:00:05,346
-  Yes, sir.
- They are on their way.

786
01:00:07,476 --> 01:00:09,076
Please stay on the line with me.

787
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:12,178
Sir, are you still there?

788
01:00:12,202 --> 01:00:13,179
Not for long!

789
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:10,252
So, this is your place, huh?

790
01:01:10,276 --> 01:01:11,925
Yep. This is it.

791
01:01:11,949 --> 01:01:13,930
I like it. It's very bohemian.

792
01:01:13,954 --> 01:01:16,381
I know, right?
It's kind of silly.

793
01:01:16,405 --> 01:01:18,622
No, I like it.
It adds to the fantasy.

794
01:01:18,646 --> 01:01:22,782
I'm a top. I like
to be in charge.

795
01:01:22,806 --> 01:01:23,806
I bet you do.

796
01:01:29,176 --> 01:01:30,750
Excuse me!

797
01:01:30,774 --> 01:01:32,722
But I like to be on top.

798
01:01:32,746 --> 01:01:33,746
So do I.

799
01:02:01,149 --> 01:02:02,852
Are you okay?

800
01:02:02,876 --> 01:02:05,039
Jesus! What the fuck?

801
01:02:05,936 --> 01:02:08,009
- Sorry, was that too much?
- Yeah.

802
01:02:10,576 --> 01:02:12,009
- Maybe a little.
- Sorry.

803
01:02:12,996 --> 01:02:14,546
Domination is sort of my thing.

804
01:02:16,956 --> 01:02:18,279
Thanks for the warning.

805
01:02:20,306 --> 01:02:22,602
- Hey, where you goin'?
- Chill, dude.

806
01:02:22,626 --> 01:02:24,422
I gotta use the bathroom.

807
01:02:24,446 --> 01:02:28,062
Give me like five or ten
minutes, I'm good to go again.

808
01:02:28,086 --> 01:02:30,452
They don't call me "the
machine" for nothin'.

809
01:02:30,476 --> 01:02:32,832
Are you gonna let me choke you?

810
01:02:32,856 --> 01:02:34,432
Absolutely.

811
01:02:34,456 --> 01:02:35,809
Stay right there.

812
01:03:12,666 --> 01:03:15,222
I know, baby. This
is the last night.

813
01:03:15,246 --> 01:03:17,907
I'll tuck you in tomorrow
night. I promise.

814
01:03:20,332 --> 01:03:21,915
I'll call you back.

815
01:04:40,197 --> 01:04:44,430
What the...

816
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:20,416
Julia?

817
01:05:22,678 --> 01:05:23,678
Are you awake?

818
01:05:36,566 --> 01:05:37,566
Officer?

819
01:05:42,976 --> 01:05:44,512
Hello?

820
01:05:44,536 --> 01:05:45,536
Officer?

821
01:05:49,206 --> 01:05:50,206
Hello?

822
01:05:53,576 --> 01:05:54,609
Is someone there?

823
01:06:03,609 --> 01:06:05,012
Julia!

824
01:06:05,036 --> 01:06:06,786
The killer's in
the fucking garden!

825
01:06:42,716 --> 01:06:43,716
Hey.

826
01:06:45,677 --> 01:06:47,502
Did you hear something?

827
01:06:47,526 --> 01:06:49,352
Huh? What?

828
01:06:49,376 --> 01:06:51,533
Why are you still here?

829
01:06:51,557 --> 01:06:52,557
Go home!

830
01:06:54,989 --> 01:06:56,522
I thought I could
buy you breakfast.

831
01:06:56,546 --> 01:06:57,546
No, thanks.

832
01:06:58,926 --> 01:07:01,219
Go, please. Don't
make this awkward.

833
01:07:02,738 --> 01:07:05,116
All right. I'm outta
here, sweet lips.

834
01:07:08,237 --> 01:07:09,731
All right, I'm goin'!

835
01:07:09,755 --> 01:07:10,971
Jesus.

836
01:07:22,607 --> 01:07:24,223
What the fu...

837
01:08:12,484 --> 01:08:16,447
Fuck, dude, really?
You need to go home.

838
01:08:16,471 --> 01:08:17,460
Who the fu...

839
01:08:57,971 --> 01:08:58,971
Lorraine?

840
01:09:06,356 --> 01:09:07,369
Oh, shit!

841
01:09:08,346 --> 01:09:09,696
Lorraine, did you see this?

842
01:09:23,728 --> 01:09:24,728
Lorraine!

843
01:09:25,648 --> 01:09:26,843
Lorraine!

844
01:09:32,534 --> 01:09:33,534
Oh, god.

845
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,349
I know who you are!

846
01:09:56,606 --> 01:09:58,712
Billy drove for TaxiQuick,

847
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:00,822
the company you
heavily invested in.

848
01:10:04,836 --> 01:10:06,379
I know it's you, James.

849
01:10:10,466 --> 01:10:12,752
I called the police and they're
gonna be here in a minute.

850
01:10:12,776 --> 01:10:14,822
No, you didn't.

851
01:10:14,846 --> 01:10:17,492
Your phone is in your bedroom.

852
01:10:17,516 --> 01:10:18,819
I used Lorraine's phone.

853
01:10:20,486 --> 01:10:21,486
I have her phone.

854
01:10:26,706 --> 01:10:29,062
When I was doing my due
diligence for TaxiQuick,

855
01:10:29,086 --> 01:10:31,052
I took a bunch of rides.

856
01:10:31,076 --> 01:10:33,212
One of the first
drivers I got was Billy.

857
01:10:33,236 --> 01:10:35,452
I could tell he was trouble.

858
01:10:35,476 --> 01:10:37,226
He had problems
everywhere he went.

859
01:10:38,286 --> 01:10:41,352
So when he told me he
knew you in high school,

860
01:10:41,376 --> 01:10:43,561
it all fell into place.

861
01:10:46,916 --> 01:10:49,232
I can tell he was
still in love with you.

862
01:10:49,256 --> 01:10:51,359
- No, he wasn't!
- Yes, he was.

863
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:54,592
When I told him I was
interested in investing in you,

864
01:10:54,616 --> 01:10:57,312
and suggested he go
work for Rock n Ride,

865
01:10:57,336 --> 01:11:00,072
to get me information
about the company,

866
01:11:00,096 --> 01:11:01,502
he jumped at the chance.

867
01:11:01,526 --> 01:11:03,252
Then it was just a matter

868
01:11:03,276 --> 01:11:05,832
of pointing the
evidence towards him.

869
01:11:05,856 --> 01:11:07,209
He was the perfect patsy.

870
01:11:18,146 --> 01:11:19,146
Why?

871
01:11:19,996 --> 01:11:22,252
Why do you wanna destroy me?

872
01:11:22,276 --> 01:11:23,282
Oh, stop it.

873
01:11:23,306 --> 01:11:25,912
It's not about you and
your silly little company.

874
01:11:25,936 --> 01:11:28,472
It's about the entire industry!

875
01:11:28,496 --> 01:11:31,312
People will be afraid
to drive or take a ride.

876
01:11:31,336 --> 01:11:33,492
Hell, after tonight,

877
01:11:33,516 --> 01:11:36,132
people won't even wanna work
for a rideshare company.

878
01:11:36,156 --> 01:11:40,092
And the cab industry
will reap the rewards.

879
01:11:40,116 --> 01:11:43,482
You're not gonna be able to
frame Billy for this tonight.

880
01:11:43,506 --> 01:11:45,632
I have him tied up outside.

881
01:11:45,656 --> 01:11:49,502
Once I kill you, I will
mortally wound him,

882
01:11:49,526 --> 01:11:51,712
and release him into
the neighborhood.

883
01:11:51,736 --> 01:11:53,736
His body will be found
blocks from here.

884
01:11:54,646 --> 01:11:57,732
With your DNA all over him.

885
01:11:57,756 --> 01:11:59,656
You're not gonna
get away with this.

886
01:12:00,596 --> 01:12:02,046
I've gotten away with more.

887
01:14:32,546 --> 01:14:33,882
Julia!

888
01:14:33,906 --> 01:14:35,192
Are you out here?

889
01:14:35,216 --> 01:14:36,216
Dad, run!

890
01:14:37,026 --> 01:14:38,192
James, but...

891
01:14:38,216 --> 01:14:39,248
James!

892
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:27,912
Mm, I like a feisty girl.

893
01:15:27,936 --> 01:15:29,449
I'm glad I saved you for last.

894
01:15:30,986 --> 01:15:32,182
You're just a little girl!

895
01:15:32,206 --> 01:15:35,566
You can't hurt me with that.
You wouldn't even know how!

896
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:58,623
Dad! Are you okay?

897
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:10,052
- I'm sorry.

898
01:16:10,076 --> 01:16:11,076
You were right.

899
01:16:12,606 --> 01:16:13,982
I'm...

900
01:16:14,006 --> 01:16:15,919
I'm never gonna doubt you again.

901
01:16:43,596 --> 01:16:45,962
Are you looking for
a safe rideshare?

902
01:16:45,986 --> 01:16:49,522
I'm Julia Altimari, CEO of
a brand new ridesharing app,

903
01:16:49,546 --> 01:16:52,312
created by women, for women.

904
01:16:52,336 --> 01:16:54,929
The drivers and the
passengers are all women.

905
01:16:59,616 --> 01:17:01,292
Oh, sorry.

906
01:17:01,316 --> 01:17:03,262
No boys allowed, ever.

907
01:17:03,286 --> 01:17:05,022
I mean, like never, ever.

908
01:17:05,046 --> 01:17:06,282
Good day.

909
01:17:06,306 --> 01:17:07,306
Sorry!

910
01:17:11,606 --> 01:17:15,222
So, if you're alone or with
your girlfriends, try us out.

911
01:17:15,246 --> 01:17:18,424
