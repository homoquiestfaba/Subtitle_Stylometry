1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:03,470
(triumphant music)

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:07,741
- [Narrator] In 1632, Andy Dufresne left Shawshank Prison

3
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:09,743
wearing nothing but- - No, no, no, Morgan.

4
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:12,979
This is an indie job, my friend.

5
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,149
(triumphant music)

6
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:19,953
In 1632 pilgrims brought the first cannabis seeds

7
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:21,721
to the United States.

8
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,056
(audience laughs)

9
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:25,558
- Marijuana is not a drug.

10
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:28,361
It is a plant that is growing in my closet.

11
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,363
(audience laughs)

12
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:31,564
- You can't get rid of it.

13
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:34,467
You know why you can't get rid of it?

14
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,136
It's a weed.

15
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:37,404
(audience laughs)

16
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:39,239
- And weed should never be expensive.

17
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:41,041
To me, weed should be like a lawyer.

18
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,911
You know, if you cannot afford some...

19
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,880
(audience laughs)

20
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,615
Some is appointed to you.

21
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:49,883
(audience laughs)

22
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:50,850
- [Interviewer] So to begin with,

23
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:51,484
have you ever smoked marijuana?

24
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:53,420
- (scoffs)

25
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,321
- Yes! - Yeah.

26
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:56,423
(smokers laughing)

27
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,324
- I'll smoke to that.

28
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,493
(school bell ringing)

29
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:03,730
- I teach high school, everybody, I'm a high school teacher.

30
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:05,265
My students can always tell when I'm high

31
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:08,268
because it becomes movie day really quickly.

32
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,769
(audience laughs)

33
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:13,807
- I totally stand against this friendly, happy, feel-good,

34
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,909
pro-marijuana culture that's out there.

35
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:19,112
- We're getting fed up with these Washington Nazis.

36
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:20,580
- Everybody's so different,

37
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:23,216
'cause some people really like it, and some people don't.

38
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,718
- Let's try to minimize something that I'm sorry to say,

39
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,487
is deadly serious.

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,156
- Do I find marijuana to be an aphrodisiac?

41
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,558
Hell yeah.

42
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,425
- (laughs) - Oh, yes!

43
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,227
- [Woman] That's how I roll.

44
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,929
- Pot makes me horny.

45
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:36,896
- Not for me, no.

46
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,431
- Really? - Yeah.

47
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,733
- They try to tell you that marijuana is not a gateway.

48
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,335
It's a huge gateway!

49
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:43,436
- Gateway drug.

50
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,004
- Your gateway theory.

51
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,842
- It's possible to just be a pot smoker.

52
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,678
It's not necessarily a gateway drug.

53
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:54,113
Sometimes, the gate is locked,

54
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,749
and I stay happily within my perimeter.

55
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,984
(audience laughs)

56
00:01:58,017 --> 00:01:59,252
- Persistent marijuana use

57
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,254
leads to the same kind of chronic lung issues.

58
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,523
I'm talking about persistent cough.

59
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:06,659
(smokers coughing)

60
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,228
(old-timey car horn blares)

61
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,696
- I love my marijuana

62
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,198
the same way I love my wife's pussy,

63
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:14,000
with purple hairs on it.

64
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:15,635
(audience laughs)

65
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:17,904
A little stinky, I'm a bit freaky like that.

66
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:20,607
- It causes huge lapses in judgment.

67
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,541
- You fucking idiot!

68
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,409
- You are, like, so high.

69
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,879
- These bitches be high on the hookah!

70
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:26,980
- Hookah pipe.

71
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,214
(gavel banging)

72
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,083
- Never use your stoner buddy for a reference.

73
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,284
When the guy called, he's like,

74
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,153
"Yeah, Dan's all motivated and shit.

75
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,455
(audience laughs)

76
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,490
(inhales deeply)

77
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,792
He don't even smoke that much weed."

78
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,529
- Early adolescence is an especially dangerous

79
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:43,997
and vulnerable time.

80
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,466
- My daddy said he tried it once.

81
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,800
- We were just messing around.

82
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,868
- I can see that.

83
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,003
Johnny, go home.

84
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,538
(jail door slamming shut)

85
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:54,240
- I'm a multitasking pot smoker.

86
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,775
It's true.

87
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,810
Just the other day, I was walking down the street,

88
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,046
I was putting eye drops in my eyes,

89
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,814
I was talking on my cell phone,

90
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,083
and I was getting hit by a car.

91
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:04,951
(audience laughs)

92
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:07,287
All at the same time.

93
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,689
- You wouldn't let your kid go out

94
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,059
and eat a bunch of deadly nightshade or hemlock.

95
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,427
- I knew in sixth grade, like, I was like,

96
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,762
"I'll probably smoke pot."

97
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,163
- Marijuana.

98
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:19,165
- Well, it's not for kids.

99
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,266
- Pot.

100
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,467
- I didn't like it at all.

101
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,603
It was in a garage with a bunch of kids.

102
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,471
(jazzy music)

103
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:29,576
- Jazz musicians and fat girls in Camaros

104
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:34,080
always have the best pot.

105
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,615
(audience laughs)

106
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:39,118
- And yet you conveniently let him smoke marijuana.

107
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:43,356
- Our daughter is using mind-altering substances!

108
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,525
- You never experimented as a kid?

109
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,260
- You can decide to break the law

110
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:48,962
and eat four pot brownies too.

111
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,830
- [Politician] Now you can sit here and try to tell me

112
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:55,001
that marijuana is a friendly, fun, silly, little drug,

113
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,403
and I will argue that you are dead wrong.

114
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,571
(businessmen laughing)

115
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,840
- Mary-ji-ji-wayne, huh?

116
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:04,110
- So why don't we start thinking of the marijuana leaf

117
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:07,580
the way we think of other leaves like the poison ivy leaf

118
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,450
or hemlock or deadly nightshade?

119
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,585
Because those are all leaves.

120
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:15,688
The first one will make you itchy for weeks,

121
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:18,458
and the second and third one will kill you.

122
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,727
(gun bangs)

123
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,595
(bong water bubbling)

124
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,697
- Somebody hands me a marijuana cigarette,

125
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,733
so I take this hit off the cigarette,

126
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:31,371
this story officially begins right here, okay?

127
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:32,572
(audience laughs)

128
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,740
Are you all with me, all right?

129
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,710
- All right, so this is a song we want to do

130
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,879
before we get into it, and it's about,

131
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,781
it's a song about every day,

132
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,616
what happens every day in our lives.

133
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,085

00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,457
- [Narrator] "Some of my finest hours

186
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,059
have been spent on my back veranda,

187
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:11,931
smoking hemp and observing as far as my eye can see."

188
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,233
Thomas Jefferson, 1781.

189
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,305
(tranquil music)

190
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,244
(birds chirping)

191
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:41,260
- Meet Dave Bertman, a 37-year-old divorced father of one,

192
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:45,932
a certified CPA, was captain of his college debate team,

193
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,201
and is a reluctant masturbator.

194
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:54,106
At the present moment, he's dreaming about salmon.

195
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:56,075
(Dave moaning)

196
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,010
(tribal music)

197
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:59,011
- Say it.

198
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,847
- Sinner. - Say it.

199
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,114
- Repent. - Repent!

200
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,616
- Say it! - Say it!

201
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,151
- Say it! - Sinner.

202
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,422
- But in approximately eight seconds,

203
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,557
Dave will become extremely flatulent,

204
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:14,694
at which point, he will awaken from his dream

205
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:18,097
into a nightmare from which he cannot escape.

206
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,233
(Dave farts)

207
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:23,736
A nightmare, which ends in a deadly collision

208
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,372
with his own- (Dave farts)

209
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:27,807
Hypocrisy.

210
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,843
(suspenseful music)

211
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,981
(calm music)

212
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:52,498
In a few short hours, Dave will be confronted with a choice,

213
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:55,701
a choice his very life depends on.

214
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:59,939
A choice, which could result in the total annihilation

215
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,208
of all mankind.

216
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,878
Okay, that's not entirely true.

217
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,814
I have a tendency to exaggerate for dramatic effect

218
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,316
when I'm doing this.

219
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:13,552
It's an issue I'm well aware of, and I'm working on it.

220
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:18,558
Plus, I'm slightly baked, so please bear with me.

221
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,694
(doorbell rings)

222
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,564
(soft rock music)

223
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,334
- Shoes off. - Sorry, Dave.

224
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:29,368
- Sorry? Don't be sorry.

225
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,137
Just take your shoes off.

226
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,673
Do you like the banner? (chuckles)

227
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,741
Can you believe it's been 20 years

228
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,411
since we've had the whole team together?

229
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,346
- I'm really, really sorry, Dave.

230
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,747
- What's going on?

231
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:42,615
- He's alone.

232
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,318
- Everybody inside! - What's going on?

233
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,452
- Go! Go! Go!

234
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:47,720
- What's going on?

235
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,021
- I got carjacked.

236
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,256
- Yeah, sorry about that, mate,

237
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:51,590
I didn't have much of a choice.

238
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,993
- Shut the door, shut the door!

239
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,061
Where's the kitchen?

240
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,829
I need time to think.

241
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:58,698
Plus, I've got the munchies, I think.

242
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,099
- The munchies? - Yeah.

243
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,334
- Authorities have received no tips, however,

244
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,804
on two suspects, seen escaping this warehouse.

245
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:06,072
- Hey, that's us.

246
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,673
- Where earlier today DEA agents discovered

247
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:12,712
over 2,000 marijuana plants of this very potent G-14 strain.

248
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,748
- That's federal G-14 medical seed, you twit!

249
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,249
- Said he knew about the lab,

250
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,987
used exclusively for terminally ill cancer patients

251
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,723
and that federal agents have no right

252
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,425
to intrude on a state's rights issue.

253
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,794
- Federal agents have no right to intrude

254
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,663
on states' rights issues!

255
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,567
- Hard to believe that with this level of public outrage,

256
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,270
activists haven't made more headway at the federal level.

257
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,239
In any case, we will be following this story

258
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:41,841
as it develops throughout the day,

259
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,610
and we'll bring you breaking news as it breaks.

260
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:47,413
But now, back to your regularly scheduled programming.

261
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:53,419
- And now, it's "Mud Slingers" with your host Hack Murphy.

262
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:57,857
- And welcome back to "Mud Slingers."

263
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,426
Tonight, we're talking marijuana legalization.

264
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,862
Should the weed be freed?

265
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:05,798
We're joined by professor emeritus from Harvard,

266
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:10,770
Dr. Willa Peterson, a leading marijuana rights advocate,

267
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:14,006
and Reverend Elmer Finkle, the Republican senator from Texas

268
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,443
and sponsor of the Milk for Cute Babies and Kittens Act,

269
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:21,881
which is now being debated on the senate floor.

270
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:25,351
Now, Dr. Peterson, it's clear you don't support this bill.

271
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:26,886
- No, sir, I don't.

272
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,188
- Well, I just can't believe how anybody could be against

273
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,257
the Milk for Cute Babies and Kittens Act.

274
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,527
- Well, sir, this bill contains nothing

275
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,062
about babies or kittens.

276
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:39,065
This is a bill proposing capital punishment

277
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,067
for repeat drug possession charges.

278
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,802
- Well, stand me knee deep in hog biscuits

279
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,336
and call me Aunt Mary,

280
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,639
aren't you just a fancy pants intellectual hippie?

281
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:50,376
- All right, now that is plain, straight talk

282
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:51,243
from an honest man.

283
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,445
What say you?

284
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,413
- Reverend, in appendices C and D,

285
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:57,016
you suggest that the program be funded

286
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,918
by diverting money from education.

287
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,187
- Well, I just don't see how you can come on the TV

288
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,656
with your fancy hair and oppose

289
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,891
the Milk for Cute Babies and Kittens Act.

290
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:10,896
- Sir, this is a law that would make it a capital crime

291
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,100
to use a substance that is neither lethal nor addictive.

292
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:18,003
- Ms. Peterson, I don't think you understand the effect

293
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,706
that these drugs can have on my gated community.

294
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:23,476
- On all of our gated communities.

295
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,545
- I'd like to introduce you to a lovely woman

296
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,315
whose life was ruined by your pot.

297
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,520
Ms. Hallworth, tell them your tragic story.

298
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:38,324
- My daughter was a sophomore in college,

299
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,593
a beautiful young lady. (sniffs)

300
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:45,631
her life was perfect until the day she was gang-raped.

301
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,567
She was my beautiful baby, and now she's tainted.

302
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,536
She's damaged goods!

303
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,472
- How do you respond to that, Ms. dopey pants?

304
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,641
- Oh, I'm sorry, did I miss something?

305
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:57,576
What does this have to do with marijuana?

306
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,979
- Well, this situation would have been a lot worse

307
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:01,914
if your pot was legal.

308
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,349
- You bet.

309
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,718
- With all due respect, ma'am, your daughter consented,

310
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,354
which I don't think you can really call rape.

311
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,022
- How do you know it was consensual?

312
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:10,956
Were you there?

313
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,826
- No, ma'am, but I rented it.

314
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,161
(Ms. Hallsworth gasps) - Ah!

315
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,363
There you go, blaming the victim.

316
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,064
How do you sleep at night?

317
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,599
- The victim?

318
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,768
She's listed as the star, the writer, the producer,

319
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,136
and the director.

320
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:30,276
- Oh! (sobs)

321
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,845
- I hope you're proud of yourself, Dr. Peterson.

322
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,079
- Hack, please.

323
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,948
I came here today to participate

324
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,184
in an intelligent, informed debate

325
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,853
on the relegalization of marijuana.

326
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,121
- Legalization?

327
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,523
The Founding Fathers of this great nation

328
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,458
must be turning in their graves!

329
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,962
- Actually, Hack, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson,

330
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,831
and Benjamin Franklin all grew cannabis.

331
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,768
- These men were also slave owners, Dr. Peterson!

332
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:58,103
And I will not have you come on my show

333
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,872
and advocate slavery!

334
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,040
- Slavery?

335
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:03,342
- Look, Ms. Peterson- - Dr. Peterson!

336
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,277
- I am in impartial journalist,

337
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:09,815
and even though I think you're a criminal with no values,

338
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,450
I am willing to hear you out,

339
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:14,486
and even offer you a little backup.

340
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,489
That's why we have a colleague of yours here today.

341
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,392
Fellow marijuana activist, Rusty Polten.

342
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,027
- Hey, man, do bongs!

343
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,729
Yo! Hey!

344
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:24,897
- Oh, Rusty. - Yeah, yeah.

345
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,932
- You share Ms. Peterson's views, yes?

346
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,467
- Right on, brother.

347
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,203
Yeah, I read some shit she wrote in Spleef Magazine,

348
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,605
and I was like, "whoa."

349
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:36,942
These fascists are trying to take our smoke

350
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,811
'cause they're just too old to party.

351
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,983
- Everything that reverend, uh, establishment here,

352
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:47,419
everything that he is selling is nothing but,

353
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:50,122
you know, shake 'n seeds, man.

354
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:51,190
- Is that right? - Yeah.

355
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,391
- Shake 'n seeds?

356
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:53,959
- Yes, it is.

357
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:58,998
One acre of hemp equals, like 40, or like 50 barrels of oil.

358
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,233
Something like that.

359
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,402
And you can make a lot of really rad shit with hemp,

360
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:08,440
like tapestries, my Hendrix tapestry, rolling papers.

361
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:09,675
What else?

362
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:10,976
You tell 'em.

363
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,078
Hats, floppy hats.

364
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,913
But you know what, we're getting fed up

365
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:17,182
with these Washington Nazis.

366
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:20,719
Yeah, well, the bong of freedom ain't cashed yet, man!

367
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,755
Me and Willa here, we just packed it

368
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,623
with some premium shit, man,

369
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,625
and we are gonna make sure everybody gets

370
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,594
a rude fucking hit, man!

371
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,629
Whoo-hoo-hoo, pass it around!

372
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,733
(bell ringing) (indistinct chatter)

373
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,201
- That was great.

374
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,471
- Thanks a lot, Rusty.

375
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:42,241
You have just set the marijuana reform back

376
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,342
another 10 years.

377
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,443
- What do you mean, man?

378
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:45,844
Come on.

379
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,513
Come on, don't be that way.

380
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:51,617
Hey, we just ripped these fascists a new one, you and me.

381
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,951
We did it, we did it!

382
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,753
- Rusty! - What?

383
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,654
- Rusty! - What?

384
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,191
- I know that you think you're helping,

385
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:02,561
but I am begging you to please stay off my side!

386
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,964
- Ah, come on, sister, come on, Willie.

387
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:07,166
Hey, come on, don't be a buzzkill.

388
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,235
Hey, let's you and me roll up a big spoocher!

389
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,637
Yeah!

390
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,971
Come on, girl!

391
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,140
(Hack and crew laughing)

392
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,376
(door thuds)

393
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:20,245
(classical music)

394
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,920
- Really excellent work again, Russell.

395
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:30,289
- Thank you, reverend, I felt it went very well.

396
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,325
I don't think that marijuana will be legalized anytime soon.

397
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,627
- (chuckles) Really, that was just excellent.

398
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,696
The president and the pharmaceutical boys

399
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,665
will be very, very pleased.

400
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:40,499
- Good.

401
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:41,834
- Fantastic!

402
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,871
Just a fantastic program, gentlemen. (chuckles)

403
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:48,374
I don't know when those liberal hippies are gonna realize

404
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:52,578
that America just doesn't respond to their message anymore.

405
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:53,746
- Boy, you're not kidding.

406
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:54,980
(men laughing)

407
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:57,349
- Now, who wants to light up a fatty?

408
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:58,517
- Sounds good to me.

409
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,785
(door knocking)

410
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,053
- I was the better natural debater,

411
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:02,955
but Bertman got the captain-

412
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:06,291
Hey, everybody, it's Captain Dave!

413
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,760
- [All] Hi, Dave.

414
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:10,129
- Hey, Skip, guys. - Hi.

415
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,967
- Gosh, it's been a while. - Yeah. (laughs)

416
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,335
You ready to party, Captain Dave, huh?

417
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,169
- Whoo!

418
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,537
- Who are the girls?

419
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,738
(girls laughing)

420
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,807
- I figured I'd bring the entertainment.

421
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,778
I knew you wouldn't object. (laughs)

422
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,045
- Oh.

423
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,881
- You gonna let us in, Captain Dave?

424
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,783
- Actually, no.

425
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,285
I'm really not feeling well.

426
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:34,853
The reunion's been canceled.

427
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,493
- I see your position.

428
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,295
However, I would like to direct your attention

429
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:46,298
to the banner on your far wall.

430
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,333
- Point. - Point to Skip.

431
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,969
- I'm not debating you, it's just,

432
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,606
you guys really can't come in.

433
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,808
- Oh.

434
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,910
- I just forgot to take the banner down.

435
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:00,312
- Point for rebuttal. - Go, Captain Dave.

436
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:03,282
- Well, if there's no reunion then

437
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,618
what's with all the cars in the driveway?

438
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,854
(girls gasping) - Yeah, yeah.

439
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,691
- Match. - Match to skip.

440
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:14,426
- Thank you. (laughs)

441
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,895
Come on, captain, get out of the way.

442
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,430
(guests laughing)

443
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,666
That's why they say debaters do it better, baby.

444
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,869
Captain of the debate team, you suck!

445
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,271
- I won't stand to be patronized.

446
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,006
- They have superior force. - I concur.

447
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,907
- Is there still food?

448
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,576
- Cell phones, please.

449
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:34,313
- Oh, no, no, cell, I'd like to debate that point on the-

450
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:37,082
Uh, good point, it has internet access.

451
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,684
Come on, hey, cell phones, quick, please.

452
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:41,520
- Calm down, just take a seat.

453
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,689
They're not gonna hurt us.

454
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,190
They're drug dealers.

455
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,726
- Medical marijuana activists.

456
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,329
- Medical marijuana activists,

457
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:53,899
who just need a place to lay low for a few hours,

458
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:54,933
and then they'll leave.

459
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,703
- This is gonna cost you extra.

460
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,071
- Is anybody else coming?

461
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,939
- That's the whole team, I swear.

462
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:01,807
(doorbell rings)

463
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,774
- Ah!

464
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,609
You, tweedledee. - Ah, hey.

465
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,443
- You, get the door!

466
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,078
Come on! Come on!

467
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,347
Convince whoever it is to go away!

468
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,281
- Mom, it's so humiliating!

469
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,516
- You get back here, young lady,

470
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,817
you get right back here right now, young lady!

471
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,018
- Daddy! (sobs)

472
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,319
- Jessica, what are you doing here?

473
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,787
- I'm giving you your daughter back.

474
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,189
- But it's not my weekend.

475
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,357
- It is now!

476
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,892
I have plans tonight.

477
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,793
- Yeah, with Robbie Rock Cock.

478
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,228
- Gina Marie!

479
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,763
- I can't trust your daughter to stay grounded

480
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,431
when I'm going out.

481
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,934
- Grounded, for what?

482
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:29,868
- For what?

483
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,303
I found this

484
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,739
(funk music)

485
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,242
in her birth control pill case.

486
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:39,611
- Birth control?

487
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,280
- I'm so not having this conversation with you, dad.

488
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:44,783
- And who is this Robbie Rock-

489
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,653
(whimsical music)

490
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,828
(Jessica wheezes)

491
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,132
(electric guitar riff)

492
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,068
- Dear lord.

493
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,736
- Would you stay focused?

494
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,472
Our daughter, our daughter is using

495
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,875
mind-altering substances!

496
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:12,477
God, I need a drink!

497
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,347
(whimsical music)

498
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:28,594
Ahh.

499
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,430
- Can you explain this?

500
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:33,565
- It's not mine, daddy!

501
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,767
I told mom that!

502
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,302
- I'm a trained psychotherapist,

503
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,771
and I can tell you that denial of one's problems,

504
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:40,906
very common.

505
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:43,742
(whimsical music)

506
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,452
- I'm not in denial!

507
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:54,620
It's not mine!

508
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:56,989
Ugh!

509
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,759
- Well, you're the master debater.

510
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,027
You talk some sense into her.

511
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:07,065
I, ahh, am going to enjoy my weekend.

512
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,035
(rock music)

513
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,138
- Anybody gonna miss the tart?

514
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:14,840
(reggae music)

515
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,742
♪ Mary Jane ♪

516
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,609
- Wow!

517
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:20,679
(Doug sniffs)

518
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,481
Oh, yes, Bubbleberry.

519
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,751
It's the perfect hybrid of the award-winning parents,

520
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,452
Bubble Gum and Blueberry.

521
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:28,887
(Doug sniffs)

522
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,925
Oh, semifinalist 2004, Cannabis Cup, very impressive.

523
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:39,498
Perhaps I should hold on to this for further analysis.

524
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:43,068
(Doug sniffs)

525
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,938
(whimsical music)

526
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,449
(Doug laughs)

527
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:04,122
- Sometimes I smoke pot, and I'll go to, like a,

528
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,759
I went to a Burger King, I go to Burger King sometimes

529
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:11,196
to eat there because I don't care about my body.

530
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:14,299
And I'll go to a Burger King, and I go to Burger King,

531
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:17,369
when I go to Burger King I enjoy their chicken club sandwich

532
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:19,705
which was available for a limited amount of time,

533
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,741
but now it's made the jump to the permanent menu.

534
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,209
And I think if we all work hard enough,

535
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:27,012
we can keep it that way, so go out and do your part.

536
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:30,482
Anyway, I go to Burger King this one time,

537
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,983
and I can immediately tell

538
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,219
I'm not dealing with Burger King's best and brightest.

539
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:36,755
This is definitely not the Indiana crew

540
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:40,525
with the AA degrees that they send off to the conventions.

541
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,662
No, this is any big, inner-city,

542
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:47,332
bottom-of-the-barrel shit staff, and I can tell right away

543
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,301
'cause they had along line of frustrated customers

544
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:50,802
at the lunch hour,

545
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,038
and then they have this short, chubby, bearded lady

546
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:54,239
working the counter, you know,

547
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:56,041
with the unintentional peach fuzz beard

548
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:58,009
built over a long period of time,

549
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,079
and you're like, "Fucking shave it, do something.

550
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,782
Shouldn't a guardian step in with a Bic at some point

551
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:05,751
and shave your monkey ass down?"

552
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:09,187
But no, she's staring at me uncontrollably, you know,

553
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,690
giving me the creeps, making me lose my appetite

554
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,358
as I gradually pass through the line.

555
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:14,860
I just want to get up to the front and say,

556
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,730
"Nothing for me, please, I'm gonna take a pass on this one.

557
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:21,500
I had an opportunity to look around your long-ass line,

558
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:24,269
and I realized this place is a shithole."

559
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,839
But I didn't do that, I didn't.

560
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,241
There was other signs too.

561
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:32,778
I peeped back into the microwave, knifeless kitchen,

562
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:35,747
and I see that there's all Hispanics back there

563
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:38,717
with English difficulties and attitude problems and,

564
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,685
nobody tense up because I'm Mexican

565
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:43,655
so it's okay for me to notice and mention that.

566
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:46,992
And then, I see that there's a,

567
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:49,094
(audience laughs)

568
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:52,330
this bloodshot semi-retired drunk with a headset

569
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,833
trying to hold the whole fucking thing together,

570
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,935
so there's bound to be problems.

571
00:23:56,968 --> 00:24:00,906
Now, I get my chicken club sandwich,

572
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,608
and everything seems cool, but the guy behind me,

573
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:07,412
who uses no plurals whatsoever, this crazy Filipino guy

574
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,847
just starts going nuts.

575
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,517
He's like, "I ordered chicken tender, 99¢ tender,

576
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,419
should be five fucking tender,

577
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:18,190
but I just got these two huge tender stuck together.

578
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:21,159
Like, two tender humping or some shit like that,

579
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:24,696
and this is not my way, this is not my way.

580
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:27,799
My way is five separate, delicious tender,

581
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:32,103
not this teenage mutant three tender faggot bullshit."

582
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,773
I was like, "fucking take it easy, yeah?

583
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,241
It's just a fucking tender."

584
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:37,609
(audience laughs)

585
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,645
- When my grandfather, Harlan Funonion,

586
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,316
set out to create the tasty snack food

587
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:45,784
that illustrates his name,

588
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,088
he could have selected a flavor that was more inviting.

589
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:53,892
Cheese, chocolate, barbecue.

590
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:54,759
But no.

591
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:57,495
He went with onions.

592
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,565
People said he was crazy.

593
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,766
They said he was retarded.

594
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,301
They said he was a douche bag,

595
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:07,606
but was he a crazy, retarded douche bag, or was he a genius?

596
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:12,744
That was a rhetorical question, you fucking gonad.

597
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:18,583
My point is, he was thinking outside the box.

598
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:21,987
My grandfather did not build fun-onions

599
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,690
into a snack food empire by doing things conventionally.

600
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:27,826
Now, we are in a real pickle here, people.

601
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,196
With all this health-conscious craziness,

602
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:34,232
it's turning into a real Snackwells motherfucker of a world.

603
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,236
And we have learned the hard way

604
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:42,707
that nobody wants a low-fat fun-onion.

605
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:51,950
Now, this is Dr. Willa Peterson from Harvard.

606
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:55,587
She is here to share with us

607
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,290
a radical new approach to fun-onions.

608
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:01,293
Ms. Peterson.

609
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,161
- Thank you, Mr. Funonion. - You're welcome.

610
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:08,066
- Folks, as your chairman has indicated,

611
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:11,136
fun-onion sales aren't what they used to be.

612
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:15,540
as you can see, over the last 10 years,

613
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:19,878
pot and fun-onion sales are reciprocal.

614
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:27,752
I believe that if fun-onion used its corporate might

615
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:34,125
to legalize marijuana, your sales would skyrocket.

616
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,129
- Sir, this is preposterous!

617
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,999
The connection between marijuana and fun-onions

618
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:42,867
is purely coincidental.

619
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,836
- Well, I disagree with that, Sanderson.

620
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,338
When I'm blazed off my ass

621
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,540
I can go through three, four bags, easy.

622
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:53,678
Sharana, honey. - Yes, Mr. Funonion?

623
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:56,247
- Could you send in Mr. Goldman, please?

624
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,216
- [Sharana] Yes, Mr. Funonion.

625
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:03,188
- Ah, now this is Mr. Arturo Goldman of the famous PR firm

626
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:07,292
of Goldman, Goldberg, Goldstein, and Goldman,

627
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:11,896
and I'm told he could sell a rusty cock ring to a bull dike.

628
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,099
- Oh, too kind, sir.

629
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,036
Gentlemen, Mr. Funonion tells me that

630
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:21,506
we need to change the way America thinks about marijuana.

631
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:24,876
Well, when it comes to changing minds,

632
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:27,779
my company is the best there is.

633
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,515
I have personally overseen the PR campaigns

634
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:34,853
for General Motors, ABC, McDonald's, and Asians.

635
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:37,188
- Which Asians?

636
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,258
- All of them.

637
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,993
About 10 years ago, when you thought of Asians,

638
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,194
what did you think?

639
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:45,964
- Camera equipment. - Mm, pocket protectors.

640
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,532
- Mustaches. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

641
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:49,000
Yeah, no, no, no, I get it.

642
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:52,971
I get it, computers, bowl cuts, small dicks.

643
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,640
But what does this have to do with you?

644
00:27:56,841 --> 00:28:00,545
- Well, the Asians came to us in '96.

645
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,647
They wanted a new image.

646
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,915
We gave it to them.

647
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:06,785
Now, when you think of Asians, you think of,

648
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:07,986
(techno music)

649
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:08,853
techno,

650
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:10,622
hip-hop,

651
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,758
big bucks,

652
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:18,763
and plenty of hot backdoor action.

653
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:19,597
- That was you?

654
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,599
Oh, thank you!

655
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,001
- Well, this is impressive.

656
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:27,172
So you think that you can help us here

657
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,007
with this marijuana business?

658
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,942
- Oh, I believe I can.

659
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:34,913
You see, gents, our voters want to keep pot illegal.

660
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,984
Well, today, the religious right is running the show.

661
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:41,286
So if you want to make a change,

662
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:43,121
you first have to appeal to them.

663
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:44,389
- How do we do that?

664
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:47,058
- You have to start by asking yourself,

665
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:50,929
"what does the religious right fear even more than drugs?"

666
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:52,764
- Dancing? - Foul language?

667
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:54,432
- The morning-after pill.

668
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:55,867
- Hell, the IRS.

669
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,802
- Oh, Jews.

670
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,705
- Queers.

671
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:02,207
- Ah.

672
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,444
- My job is to convince the parents of the Bible Belt

673
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:11,449
that marijuana use will curb homosexual impulses.

674
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,518
You can sell them that.

675
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:17,455
They will be scoring weed for their own kids just in case.

676
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:20,959
It will be legal within a year, and then, my friends,

677
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:23,394
fun-onion will regain its rightful place

678
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,464
at the top of the snack charts.

679
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:27,332
- Is it true?

680
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,136
- Since when has truth had anything to do

681
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:32,737
with marijuana propaganda?

682
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,907
If they can use terrorists

683
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,943
to scare people out of smoking pot,

684
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:43,948
then we can use homos to scare them back into it.

685
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:47,385
- Jesus Christ, this is.

686
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,888
(staff applauding)

687
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,056
Thank you, thank you!

688
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,325
God damn it, it's about time

689
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,861
I had something fucking happening.

690
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:58,696
- Me, smoke pot, no.

691
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,532
Well, I mean, I smoked it a few times,

692
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:01,799
I'm not, like, against it or anything,

693
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,902
but it just doesn't work for me.

694
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:07,906
The times that I have, you know, it was paranoia, no effect,

695
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:11,876
paranoia, ill, and then the last time,

696
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,078
okay, well, I smoked a little bit of it,

697
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:19,117
and my heart started pounding, my, like, limbs went numb.

698
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,486
My tongue, like, felt like it was swelling

699
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:22,754
up like when you go to the dentist

700
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:23,822
and get that Novocain shot, thinking, like,

701
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:25,523
"oh, god, I got to keep moving,

702
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:27,292
I got to keep talking, or I'm gonna die," right?

703
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:31,429
But the worst part was, it was a, it was a first date.

704
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,331
"Will you come back to my place?

705
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:36,334
because I just don't want to be alone right now."

706
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,136
And I never smoked again.

707
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,607
- Honey, can I come in?

708
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,142
- Just leave her be, mate.

709
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,377
- Excuse me if I don't take parental advice

710
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:47,879
from a drug dealer!

711
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:51,916
- Medical marijuana activist!

712
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,785
(muffled rock music)

713
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:56,154
(Dave sighs)

714
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,655
- My daughter's a drug addict.

715
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,159
- Kinda funny you're more concerned about a little grass

716
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,694
than me having a gun.

717
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:04,762
- Yeah, do you know how many people are killed each year

718
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:07,232
by the accidental discharge of a firearm?

719
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:10,134
(whimsical music)

720
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:13,404
- Trust me, I'm bothered by the gun too.

721
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,707
Okay, but if you're so concerned about my daughter,

722
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,442
why don't you let her go?

723
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:24,382
(hostages gasping and murmuring)

724
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:25,483
- Look!

725
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:27,318
We're not letting anybody go!

726
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:31,356
But we don't want to scare your kid.

727
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:35,159
- So you guys just pretend to have your little barbecue.

728
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:38,329
Steph and I will keep the guns out of sight.

729
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:41,266
As long as nobody does anything stupid

730
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:44,736
we're not gonna have a problem!

731
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,504
- We'd like to pass on a rebuttal.

732
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:48,072
- I concur. - All right.

733
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:53,144
- There's ads in the back of High Times Magazines

734
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:56,881
for marijuana being sold without THC.

735
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:58,916
Hey, people drink decaf.

736
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,918
People drink de-alcoholized beer.

737
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,020
All the bloating.

738
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:04,589
No buzz.

739
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:07,358
(majestic music)

740
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:14,198
- My name is Jesco Rollins,

741
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:17,135
and my family has owned and operated this farm

742
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:19,837
for, the last 80 years.

743
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:27,178
Now, there's been a lot of talk in this community

744
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:29,814
about the legalization of marijuana.

745
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:34,218
Now, some folks say it's got thousands of uses:

746
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:36,921
makes sick people feel better,

747
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:41,159
makes stronger fibers for rope, cloth, and paper.

748
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:43,194
Now, marijuana's a profitable crop,

749
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:45,029
even if no part of the plant is used,

750
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:47,532
'cause it fertilizes the soil,

751
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:50,368
keeps other weeds from growing.

752
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,403
And some folks say

753
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:55,907
that if marijuana was legalized and taxed,

754
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,742
it'd be a whole lot more money

755
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,944
to build better schools and roads

756
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:02,347
that folks around here and others sure could use.

757
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:04,048
Yeah.

758
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,953
Legalization of marijuana

759
00:33:08,986 --> 00:33:12,323
would be a $24-billion industry

760
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:15,126
right here in the United States alone.

761
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:18,863
It'd save a lot of farms, make a lot of people rich.

762
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:21,232
But not me.

763
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:25,603
Because this is not that kind of farm,

764
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:28,206
and I'm not that kind of farmer.

765
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:33,177
I grow fake pot, just like my daddy and my granddaddy did.

766
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:36,714
For the last 80 years, here on the Rollins farm,

767
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:39,317
we grow Tootie Puff, Warlock Smoke,

768
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:43,221
and some of the finest strains of marijuana substitutes,

769
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:48,092
guaranteed to be 100% legal and not to get you high.

770
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:51,696
It's the life me and my kids were born into.

771
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:55,032
But if real marijuana is legalized,

772
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,834
it's gonna be the end of this farm

773
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,870
and a lot of other farms like it.

774
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:02,173
It's gonna be the end of an American way of life.

775
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,975
Across this country, I know

776
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,012
35 other farmers just like me,

777
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,849
and with no means to provide,

778
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,651
I would have no other choice but

779
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,622
to shoot my family!

780
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:22,160
When people look at me, they say,

781
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:25,196
"Hey, it's common sense to grow marijuana."

782
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,232
Well, I look them right in the eye, and I say,

783
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:31,803
"Common sense ain't American to me."

800
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,804
- It is getting a bit nippy out here.

801
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:08,673
- How, it's blazing hot.

802
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:13,978
- (laughing) it's all over your face.

803
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:14,846
- Where?

804
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:26,691
- And so the reunion went on as planned.

805
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:30,928
On the surface, a simple barbecue,

806
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:34,198
but underneath, a danger lurked,

807
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:35,733
which threatened the very fabric

808
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:37,902
of the space-time continuum!

809
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:40,438
Which is what I would say if I

810
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,273
were still exaggerating, which I am no longer doing,

811
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:45,176
so let's just say all is not well under the surface

812
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:46,944
and call it a day.

813
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,380
(rock music)

814
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:57,221
(Skip clears throat)

815
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:58,890
- Now, I know we agreed not to try anything,

816
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:01,158
but a few of the guys and I, we want to go for it.

817
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:03,327
- Forget it, Skip, it's too risky.

818
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,562
- There's only two of them.

819
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,197
- I'm captain of the debate team, Skip,

820
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,065
not the wrestling team.

821
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,868
I didn't bring home the state championship trophy

822
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:12,870
just so I could bonk someone over the head with it

823
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:14,472
when they didn't agree with me.

824
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,706
- Agreed.

825
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,675
We must do something, and we must concede

826
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:20,878
that our weapons are our brains, not our fists.

827
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:23,180
- Well, what do you suggest, captain?

828
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:25,316
- Get them to see the error of their ways

829
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,651
and turn themselves in.

830
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,818
- I concur.

831
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,288
(rock music)

832
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,527
♪ Hey, hey, who found the law ♪

833
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:39,430
- So how long have you two been drug dealers?

834
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:44,001
Oh, I mean medical marijuana activists? (laughs)

835
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:47,138
- How long have you been a total dickweed, Skippy?

836
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:48,906
- I'm sorry, but you must admit

837
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,875
that legalizing medical marijuana

838
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:52,209
is just an excuse to make it easier

839
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:54,145
for you potheads to get high.

840
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,647
- Beer? - Yeah, sure.

841
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:58,449
- We believe that withholding medical treatment

842
00:36:58,482 --> 00:36:59,951
from the terminally ill

843
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:03,454
simply to stem recreational pot smoking is unethical,

844
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:04,855
and guess what, Skippy?

845
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:05,890
So do you.

846
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:09,393
- Oh, so do I? (laughs)

847
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:12,763
I think you two are about to get a little lesson in debate.

848
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:15,099
You don't get to tell me what I believe,

849
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:16,667
you have to convince me.

850
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:17,969
And so, ugh.

851
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:21,038
- Something wrong?

852
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,674
- Uh, no, no. (coughs)

853
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:26,444
Suddenly, I just feel a little...

854
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:27,311
- Nauseous?

855
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,581
- It's probably because of this,

856
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:32,416
I slipped it into your beer.

857
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,584
(Skip gags)

858
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:35,052
You poisoned me?

859
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,088
- Relax, it's just a little ipecac,

860
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:39,590
used to induce vomiting in the event of poisoning.

861
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:41,258
We find it nicely simulates

862
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,728
the nauseousness of chemotherapy.

863
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,962
(Skip vomiting)

864
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,397
- Oh!

865
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,432
Oh, at this point, your legal options for your nausea

866
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,769
are pretty much your Compazine, your Ativan,

867
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:53,804
and your Decadron!

868
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,774
- Which can also cause acne, headaches, sore throats,

869
00:37:56,807 --> 00:38:00,111
unusual hair growth, and funnily enough, nausea again.

870
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:01,012
(Skip retching)

871
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:01,879
- Yeah!

872
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,015
Let it go, baby!

873
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:05,650
(Skip retching)

874
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:08,085
But if you're willing to pay 40 bucks per pill

875
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,820
and are okay with just constipation and headaches,

876
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:13,124
then you got to go for your Zofran or your Kytril.

877
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,192
- Unless you're one of those hypersensitive types,

878
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,994
of which these pills could send

879
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:19,930
into a potentially fatal anaphylactic shock.

880
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,266
(Skip retching)

881
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:24,502
- And that's assuming that any of these dangerous drugs

882
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:27,171
work at all, which they don't for everyone.

883
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:31,676
- Much less the 50 million Americans without insurance

884
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,444
who can't even afford them.

885
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:36,213
- Isn't it a shame that there isn't a cheap,

886
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:39,517
essentially harmless alternative available?

887
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,286
- Wouldn't that be nice?

888
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:43,220
- Oh, my god!

889
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:45,222
I feel horrible!

890
00:38:46,323 --> 00:38:47,992
There must be something I can take!

891
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:49,193
- Sorry!

892
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:50,261
(imitates buzzer) You're all out of options,

893
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,229
the legal ones, at least.

894
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:54,265
- I don't care!

895
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:56,133
I'll try anything.

896
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,168
(Skip retches)

897
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:59,136
Oh, I feel like shit!

898
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,305
(Doug humming)

899
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,075
(majestic music)

900
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:14,852
- Feeling better?

901
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:17,388
(Skip coughs)

902
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:33,237
- [Interviewer] So to begin with,

903
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:34,538
have you ever smoked marijuana?

904
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:39,410
- (scoffs) Yeah, I smoked pot, uh,

905
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:43,681
every day, all day for about 22 years.

906
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,250
There's three phases that I certainly went through.

907
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:49,286
First, it was fun, then it was fun with problems,

908
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,888
and then it was just problems.

909
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:55,459
I went into rehab in 1990, okay, a 28-day program,

910
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:57,895
but prior to that, about two years before that,

911
00:39:57,928 --> 00:40:00,030
I went to a marijuana anonymous meeting.

912
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:04,201
That was my first introduction to a 12-step meeting.

913
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:07,905
And I'm sitting in this big circle with about 40 people,

914
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,840
and this guy's talking.

915
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:12,510
I'm, like, two people away from him, right,

916
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,578
and I remember it was, you know,

917
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:17,715
he had this phrase that he said, he said,

918
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:22,753
"I knew I hit bottom when I drank my bong juice."

919
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:26,624
And I'm looking around.

920
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:28,826
There's eight people shaking their fucking heads like,

921
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:31,529
"Oh, yeah, I remember when I did that," you know?

922
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:35,099
And I remember looking over at him, and I just said to him,

923
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:38,235
"You drank your fucking bong juice?"

924
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,571
And, you know, 42 people went, "shh!"

925
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:44,308
You know, I didn't know the rules, you know.

926
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:46,043
And there was, there was, like, eight or 10 people

927
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:48,979
that had did, and I had made tea with mine, you know,

928
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:49,980
'cause I was classy.

929
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,119
- Back in the day, we used to smoke a lot of weed all day.

930
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:56,787
All day.

931
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,622
Wake and bake, as they say.

932
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:03,561
Put the bong in the freezer, get it cool, and get it going.

933
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,729
Get it going early.

934
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:08,866
I love to get high and watch "Wheel of Fortune."

935
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,801
Really high.

936
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,136
Right before a big puzzle.

937
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,606
And then sometimes, it's down to one letter

938
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,042
and I still can't get it.

939
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:19,009
I'm just staring.

940
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:21,512
"Bone with the Wind."

941
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:22,980
"Bone with the Wind."

942
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:24,281
"Bone with the Wind."

943
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:28,419
Uh, I don't know, uh, "Bone with the Wind."

944
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:30,054
I've done that, I've been there.

945
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,158
Another friend of mine,

946
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,393
he likes to watch the Weather Channel.

947
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:39,964
And then he'll wait till I'm out of town and call me.

948
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,799
"Dude, where are you?"

949
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,235
(chuckles) "Cincinnati."

950
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:45,769
"Is it partly cloudy?"

951
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:47,438
"Fucking A, I knew it, man!"

952
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:49,607
Gets all jacked up about it.

953
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,177
Weed, makes the boring not so boring.

954
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:55,713
This is really good.

955
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,549
I'm not even that high.

956
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:00,618
- And if you're some kind of religious freak

957
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,353
and you think marijuana's wrong,

958
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:06,657
may I please quote from Genesis 1 and 9,

959
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:12,029
"all seed-bearing plants I give to you."

960
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:14,565
(audience cheers and applauds)

961
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:15,432
Namaste.

962
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:19,103
(rock music)

963
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:21,138
- Feeling better?

964
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:26,243
- Yes, I am, Doug.

965
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:32,016
But I still think marijuana should be illegal.

966
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:32,883
- You do?

967
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:36,287
- I mean, it should be illegal

968
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,522
for pot to be illegal. (laughs)

969
00:42:38,555 --> 00:42:39,924
- I'll smoke to that.

970
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:48,265
- Okay, it appears we lost Skip.

971
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:51,035
- Obviously, we can't hit him on the medical front.

972
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,703
What's left, Gouda?

973
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,538
- Uh, lost productivity.

974
00:42:54,571 --> 00:42:56,307
- Loosening of sexual inhibitions.

975
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:00,210
Oh, god, it's already started.

976
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,745
- You guys figure it out.

977
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:03,314
I'll be back.

978
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:04,148
Can we talk now?

979
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:05,683
- I can't believe it.

980
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:07,184
Mom grounds me 'cause she finds some pot

981
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:09,887
that isn't even mine while your friends are getting

982
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,356
totally baked on the couch!

983
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:15,893
- (laughs) okay, first of all, Skip is an adult.

984
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,394
- Something for ya!

985
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,930
(Skip farts)

986
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:23,367
(Skip and Doug laughing)

987
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:25,836
- Oh, oh.

988
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:28,305
- Secondly.

989
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:29,239
- Aw, come on.

990
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:32,242
You never experimented as a kid?

991
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,979
- Would you please mind your own business?

992
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:36,647
- Well, did you?

993
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,718
- (scoffs)

994
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:43,087
(exotic music)

995
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:43,954
- Come on.

996
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:45,889
Try it.

997
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:49,960
- Well, my daddy said he tried it once,

998
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:53,130
so I guess it'll be okay.

999
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:04,875
Oh, boys!

1000
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:05,743
whoo-hoo!

1001
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:10,647
Yeah boy!

1002
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:13,584
Hey you!

1003
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:18,322
I'll suck your dick for some weed! (chuckles)

1004
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:21,525
You, I'll let you ass-fuck me for a dime bag!

1005
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:24,495
I'm HIV negative!

1006
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:25,329
I swear!

1007
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:31,335
- No, I have never, ever tried marijuana, ever.

1008
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:34,738
It's a deadly drug that will ruin your life.

1009
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:37,341
- Oh, wow!

1010
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:40,110
I am fucked up.

1011
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:41,378
- See?

1012
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:44,048
(Gina scoffs)

1013
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:45,015
- Nice work, Skip.

1014
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:46,250
- No, man.

1015
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:49,820
I mean, I am really, really fucked up.

1016
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,689
- I can see that!

1017
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:54,024
(Skip laughs)

1018
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:54,858
- Won't stop me.

1019
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:59,997
(smooth rock music)

1020
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:05,736
In fact, I've never been this fucked up in my life.

1021
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:08,272
(Skip laughs)

1022
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:11,408
Hello.

1023
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:13,977
- Hello.

1024
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:15,646
- Who are you?

1025
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:18,816
- I'm your narrator.

1026
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,085
- My narrator?

1027
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:25,656
- Who the hell are you talking to?

1028
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:29,493
- Apparently, we have a narrator. (laughs)

1029
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:34,932
Television?

1030
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:35,966
- Good plan.

1031
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:38,769
- Indubit-bitably.

1032
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:41,672
(Skip laughs)

1033
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:43,707
- Hello, American men.

1034
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,443
Each day up on your 24-hour news channel

1035
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:49,513
you see hundreds of fundamentalist women.

1036
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:52,549
But oh, no, you don't see them at all.

1037
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,051
No worries.

1038
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:57,654
Ajmal is here, and Ajmal know what men want to see.

1039
00:45:57,688 --> 00:46:02,459
Ajmal Kadivay present "Fundamentalist Girls Gone Wild!"

1040
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:04,661
These hot fundamentalist ladies

1041
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:08,065
are showing it all for the pleasure of men who buy videotape

1042
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:11,034
because these bitches be high on the hookah.

1043
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:12,603
- Hookah hookah hoookah pipe!

1044
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:16,440
- Yes, you get cheek, you get forehead, you get chin,

1045
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:20,210
You get nose, and you get plenty of sexy, happy, mouth.

1046
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:21,812
(woman ululates)

1047
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:25,949
For to see the eyes of such lovely women is too hot for TV.

1048
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:28,118
You got to order tape from Ajmal.

1049
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:30,954
And if you call right now, you're also going to get

1050
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:33,924
"Fundamentalist Voyeur Fantasy."

1051
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:37,060
Remember, fellas, these hot broads are the property of

1052
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:40,297
other men, but you can sneak a peek

1053
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:44,768

1054
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:49,807
So that means two hot and happy videotapes for price of one.

1055
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:51,608
- Hot and happy.

1056
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:55,112
- Ajmal been to America, and Ajmal understand,

1057
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:58,982
American sluts show filthy tit and butts all day long,

1058
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:01,652
so it's no big deal to see anymore.

1059
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:06,657
But fundamentalist ladies, you know this very, very special

1060
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:08,425
for you to see.

1061
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:10,861
This tape hot as camel's balls.

1062
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:11,695
- Camel's balls.

1063
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:13,497
- [Women] Camel's balls!

1064
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:14,998
- Ajmal just dub a new batch

1065
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:17,701

I wait for your order now!

1067
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:22,439
(women screaming)

1068
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:30,948
- It's sort of an upside-down Q, some squiggly lines,

1069
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:32,583
something that looks like a IUD.

1070
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:35,052
- A four?

1071
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:38,188
- Oh, hell.

1072
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:41,158
(narrator snaps fingers)

1073
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:44,661
- Wow, that is so cool!

1074
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:46,697
- I'm good.

1075
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,801
- We got to get these guys out of here.

1076
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:52,636
Tell me you got something, Gouda.

1077
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:56,673
- Okay, we open with highway fatalities.

1078
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,109
Segue into public health costs.

1079
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:01,411
- Do a section on pot as a gateway drug.

1080
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:03,947
- Gateway drug, I like it.

1081
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:06,583
- Mm-hmm, then we end with the loss of productivity

1082
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:09,553
and the demise of civilization.

1083
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:11,388
- Perfect, brilliant!

1084
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:12,256
- I concur.

1085
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,727
- Hey, these brownies are really good.

1086
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,628
- [Debaters] Mm-hmm.

1087
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:20,664
- Who brought them? - I don't know.

1088
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:24,901
(gong rings)

1089
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:29,406
- Thought we'd contribute a little something

1090
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,440
to the barbecue.

1091
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:32,843
- You didn't.

1092
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:34,344
- You guys have such nice opinions

1093
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:35,912
about something you don't do.

1094
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:37,848
Thought a little personal experience

1095
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:40,584
might help you redefine your strategy.

1096
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:42,419
(spooky music)

1097
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:43,287
Boo!

1098
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,956
(debaters screaming)

1099
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:49,293
(rock music) (debaters panicking)

1100
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:50,160
- No! no!

1101
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:52,596
Bad brownie!

1102
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,200
- Why? - Ah!

1103
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:01,738
♪ The shape was gone ♪

1104
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:05,175
♪ There were lazy people hanging all over the place ♪

1105
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:08,111
- So Johnny Buskett's gonna sit there and tell me,

1106
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:12,015
Thomas, that he's never used performance-enhancing drugs?

1107
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:12,916
- Never, Tommy.

1108
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,651
- Thomas, ever?

1109
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:16,019
- T, what'd I say?

1110
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,589
- What'd I say, Thomas, Buskett, okay?

1111
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,458
- Let me tell you something, T.

1112
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:24,995
Weed is not a performance-enhancing drug, all right.

1113
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:26,797
The only way weed is gonna enhance

1114
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:29,266
Johnny Buskett's performance is if they start

1115
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,802
sprinkling chocolate chip cookies in the end zone.

1116
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:34,538
- Aha, so you admit to some form of drug abuse,

1117
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:35,706
don't you, Buskett?

1118
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,841
- Listen, T, you ever hear of Vicodin?

1119
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:39,276
You ever hear of Codeine?

1120
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,878
Man, those are gateway drugs, come on.

1121
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:44,214
- I got five words for you, JB, all right, five words,

1122
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:46,149
one for every suspension.

1123
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:49,553
Marijuana, class one illegal drug.

1124
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:52,022
- Oh, don't sing illegal to me.

1125
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:53,924
Isn't teenage drinking illegal?

1126
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:55,092
'Cause that's how I remember

1127
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:56,626
when the Bush twins were doing it,

1128
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,595
they ain't go to jail, they got a Girls Gone Wild video.

1129
00:49:58,628 --> 00:49:59,563
- This is not about the Bush twins,

1130
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:01,198
this is about Johnny Buskett.

1131
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:02,999
- That's right, and Johnny Buskett

1132
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:05,001
ain't doing cocaine, all right?

1133
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:08,004
I am Johnny Buskett, not Darryl Strawberry.

1134
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:10,607
After getting abused all Sunday afternoon,

1135
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,576
there ain't nothing wrong with going home,

1136
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:15,312
firing up a blunt, breaking out the Cristal.

1137
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:19,049
Gets me in the mood for my life and my wife.

1138
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:20,517
- Oh, I guess your wife, huh?

1139
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:23,754
You haven't heard about marijuana maybe

1140
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:27,657
being linked to impotence, have ya, JB, hmm?

1141
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:32,229
- Man, I don't know what kind of weed you been smoking.

1142
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:35,465
Maybe you need to check on some legally prescribed Viagra,

1143
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:39,536
'cause Johnny ain't never had no problem with his Buskett.

1144
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:41,872
Now, somebody get this boy laid.

1145
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:44,474
(upbeat music)

1146
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:49,413
- Thanks for joining us.

1147
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:51,448
Today, I'll be addressing some of your letters

1148
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:54,184
about the measurements we deal with on the show.

1149
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,620
Now, if you're preparing an overdose

1150
00:50:56,653 --> 00:51:00,390
using schedule one drugs, it's not so much the ingredients,

1151
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:03,593
but the amounts you want to be mindful of.

1152
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:07,197
Feast your eyes on these delicious spices of life.

1153
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,400
These are for my own personal canned preserves.

1154
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:12,369
Now, if you want to create a memorable

1155
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:16,239
barbecue overdose of cocaine, we always say,

1156
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:19,543
"less than a pinch will do the trick."

1157
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:23,280
An overdose can call for as little as 25 milligrams.

1158
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:25,582
Toot.

1159
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:30,654
A good way to remember is to think of a cornflake.

1160
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,061
Mmm.

1161
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,697
Now, I know some of you have tried overdose recipes

1162
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:44,501
using brown sugar, not that kind of brown sugar.

1163
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:46,470
This kind of brown sugar.

1164
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:49,906
Now, this is my own homegrown afghani heroin,

1165
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:53,643
but you can use black tar, china white,

1166
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:56,313
or some brown sugar from your local skag dealer.

1167
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:03,053
Now, that's a good thing.

1168
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:07,390
Remember, a little goes a long way

1169
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:09,226
when you're chasing the dragon.

1170
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,396
An overdose can come as cheaply as 80 milligraMs.

1171
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,832
Now, remember, a good way to eyeball this

1172
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:18,301
is to look at the markings on a syringe.

1173
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:20,937
It's equal to about the weight of half a peanut.

1174
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:25,909
I like to put a little H in anything.

1175
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:27,611
I could have it by itself,

1176
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:31,114
or with a little melted butter on movie night.

1177
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:33,049
Oh, I'm a heroin junkie.

1178
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:41,324
Remember, our federal government reserves schedule one

1179
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:44,694
for the most toxic illegal drugs.

1180
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:46,463
One would think with these substances

1181
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:49,432
that an overdose was easy to prepare.

1182
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:51,635
That's why I think this last ingredient

1183
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,670
shouldn't be in here at all.

1184
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:57,974
For a marijuana overdose, we'd need to prepare over

1185
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:01,978
1,500 pounds of marijuana serve it smoked

1186
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:05,682
in under 15 minutes. (chuckles)

1187
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:07,784
Now, that would be a fatty.

1188
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:13,189
In fact, that's enough marijuana to equal the weight

1189
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:17,460
of these seven gorgeous hunks of man meat from the DEA.

1190
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:21,698
Or about a quarter million pot brownies.

1191
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:23,300
Oh, never mind the overdose.

1192
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:26,102
That would be murder on the thighs.

1193
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:30,140
No es bueno. (laughs)

1194
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:32,509
Now, with portions that size,

1195
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:34,911
marijuana just doesn't seem as dangerous

1196
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:37,614
as these other schedule one drugs.

1197
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:40,016
But I'm sure they have a reason.

1198
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,751
I'm not one to question things,

1199
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:43,987
especially not our government.

1200
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,656
That would make me a traitor.

1201
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:49,059
Thanks for joining us, we'll see you next week.

1202
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:52,829
- Come on, man.

1203
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:54,130
Do it again, do it again.

1204
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:57,300
- [Narrator] "There is no evidence

1205
00:53:57,334 --> 00:54:01,638
that marijuana serves as a stepping-stone to other drug use.

1206
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:04,174
In fact, most drug users

1207
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:06,910
do not begin their drug use with marijuana.

1208
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:09,446
They begin with alcohol and nicotine."

1209
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,415
National Academy of Sciences.

1210
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,120
- Wow, that is so cool.

1211
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:27,063
- Went to Amsterdam.

1212
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,699
You might not know that they have stuff in Amsterdam

1213
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:33,236
that's legal that's not legal here.

1214
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:38,208
Little things like weed and prostitutes.

1215
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:40,577
I don't know how you feel about those things,

1216
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:41,945
but you know what they say.

1217
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:43,046
"When in Rome

1218
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:46,716
go to Amsterdam."

1219
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,451
(audience laughs)

1220
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:51,821
(acoustic guitar music)

1221
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:55,358
- What's wrong, man?

1222
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:57,661
- Dude, I think I see Hall & Oates.

1223
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:03,166
♪ Oh, here she comes ♪

1224
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:06,069
♪ Watch out boy, she'll chew you up ♪

1225
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:07,737
- I do, I see Hall & Oates.

1226
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:10,573
♪ Oh, oh, here she comes, she's a man eater ♪

1227
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:12,275
- It's Hall & Oates.

1228
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:17,747
- Man, you ever break your weed scale?

1229
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:19,716
(audience laughs)

1230
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:22,152
And have to go to the store and weigh your shit?

1231
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:26,656
All up in Safeway trying to act natural.

1232
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:29,526
(audience laughs)

1233
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:35,398
Sometimes, I wish I sold weed, you know,

1234
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:37,534
'cause I would revolutionize the industry.

1235
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:43,073
Seriously, man, 'cause I would combine weed with snacks.

1236
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:44,708
(audience laughs)

1237
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:45,942
This is how it would go,

1238
00:55:45,975 --> 00:55:48,244
some guy, you know, he buys an eighth.

1239
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:50,480
And all of a sudden, he's looking, and he's like,

1240
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:51,948
"hold on, Red.

1241
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:55,719
Now, what's this stuff mixed in with the weed?"

1242
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:59,723
"Those are pretzels, man."

1243
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:02,525
(audience laughs)

1244
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,761
I have a little bible in my back pocket,

1245
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:07,063
and it's not because I'm religious.

1246
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:08,565
Man, fuck that.

1247
00:56:08,598 --> 00:56:09,833
If they didn't want you to roll joints with the bible,

1248
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:12,368
they wouldn't have left those last pages blank.

1249
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:14,571
(audience laughs)

1250
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:18,575
- Said it's like a burrito kinda. (laughs)

1251
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:19,442
- What?

1252
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:22,879
(Doug laughs)

1253
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:26,583
- How would you like a toke of my Big Bambu?

1254
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:27,784
- Ooh!

1255
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:30,120
Bambu rolling papers, that's how I roll.

1256
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:32,055
- (sniffs) Oh, yeah!

1257
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:34,791
That's some good shit rolled up in that herb.

1258
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:36,025
Double wide!

1259
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,261
- I have to reconcile smoking pot

1260
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:39,796
now that I have fucking kids

1261
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:42,832
and I'm trying to learn from that.

1262
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:44,200
I watched that commercial,

1263
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,435
you seen that fucking commercial

1264
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:47,804
where the dad goes in his teenage son's room.

1265
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:51,007
Brings a joint in, he's like, "where'd you get this?

1266
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,942
Where'd you get this?"

1267
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:54,344
Remember what the kid says?

1268
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:55,879
"It's yours, dad.

1269
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,680
I got it from you!"

1270
00:56:57,714 --> 00:56:58,782
(audience laughs)

1271
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:00,016
If I was the dad, I'd be like,

1272
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:02,018
"well, give it back, you fucking thief.

1273
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:03,253

1274
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:05,188

I would tear that putty up.

- Oh, the things I could do to those girls.

1294
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:17,193
- You wouldn't know what to do.

1295
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:19,262
- Hey, I know how to eat.

1296
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:21,998
And I got the munchies.

1297
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:24,634
- That's a good point, I have no counter.

1298
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,803
Look, look, look, look, they're debating.

1300
00:58:31,474 --> 00:58:33,476

1301
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:36,112
- About what?

1302
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:39,249
- The difference between a Brazilian wax over a Hitler?

1305
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:43,052
- The little mustache, they trim it, it's--

1306
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:44,754
- The mustache, the little, the little!

1307
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:46,823
- Look, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle

1308
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:49,826
clearly illustrates that one singular electron

1309
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,995
can, indeed, be tracked to two distinct locations

1310
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,063
at the exact same instant.

1311
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:56,799
Thus, laid the foundation for quantum physics.

1312
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:59,936
- Please, we're not talking a singular subatomic particle.

1313
00:58:59,969 --> 00:59:02,472
We're talking about multicellular organisms

1314
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:05,308
of mass and density, and therefore,

1315
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:07,076
your theory on quantum physics

1316
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:10,013
is about as limp as the pre-Viagra landscape.

1317
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,949

1328
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,751
"man, I'm fried, I'm beat, I am whooped!"

1329
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:50,153
God says, "well, take a vacation,

1330
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:51,487
go down to Earth for a while."

1331
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:52,655
"All right."

1332
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:54,057
Jesus goes down to Earth, he's hitchhiking.

1333
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,725
Gets a ride with a trucker, gets in the cab.

1334
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:57,060
They're going down the road.

1335
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:00,630
Trucker says, "man, it's a little warm in here.

1336
01:00:00,663 --> 01:00:03,232
I got some Poland spring on ice, cold bottle of water?"

1337
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,834
"Yeah, that sounds good, sure."

1338
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:11,841
Down the road.

1339
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,244
A few miles down the road, the trucker says, "you hungry?"

1340
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,580
Jesus says, "I could eat."

1341
01:00:17,613 --> 01:00:20,116
"My wife makes fantastic tuna fish, tuna on rye,

1342
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:22,485
lettuce, tomato, a little salt, pepper, you in?"

1343
01:00:22,518 --> 01:00:23,353
"Sounds good, sure."

1344
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:24,954
"I'll give you half."

1345
01:00:28,224 --> 01:00:29,792
"Your wife makes excellent tuna fish."

1346
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:31,227
"(scoffs) what'd I tell ya?"

1347
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:33,529
Going down the road.

1348
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:36,733
Few miles down the road, the trucker says,

1349
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:38,668
"You want to smoke a joint?"

1350
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:41,471
And Jesus is like, "I'm on vacation." (chuckles)

1351
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:43,506
(audience laughs)

1352
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:46,109
Trucker takes out a joint, sparks it up.

1353
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:54,183
(audience laughs)

1354
01:00:57,687 --> 01:00:59,555
"You don't know who I am, do ya?"

1355
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:01,190
Trucker says, "No."

1356
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:02,458
He says, "I'm Jesus Christ.

1357
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,761
I'm the Lord, the son of God, Jesus Christ."

1358
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:07,196
The trucker says, "that's some good shit, ain't it?"

1359
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:10,066
(audience laughs)

1360
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:12,602
- They call me Count Smokula

1361
01:01:12,635 --> 01:01:15,705
because I'm the smokingest dude on the planet Earth,

1362
01:01:15,738 --> 01:01:18,207
and also because I'm from Smokesylvania.

1363
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:22,011
- Marilize legaljuana.

1364
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:25,581

Did you get it?

1372
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:52,308
- Rock and roll.

1373
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:56,679
- So my roommate is also a stoner.

1374
01:01:56,712 --> 01:02:00,049
He likes to go to places where weed is a-plentiful

1375
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:04,520
and then mail it to himself where it's less a-plentiful.

1376
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:08,091
I'm not saying you should do that, but if you do,

1377
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:10,293
don't put your own name on the package.

1378
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:14,997
And don't put your roommate's name either, that's bullshit.

1380
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:17,667
And if you're gonna make up a name,

1381
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:20,636
be careful of the name that you make up, all right?

1382

Smuggly McWeed. (audience laughs)

1383
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,775
The most annoying part about my stoner roommate

1384
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:27,110
is that he's always got to tell me

1385
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:29,679
his stupid-ass stoner fun facts.

1386
01:02:30,746 --> 01:02:32,148
He finds out a fact

1387
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:33,616
and thinks that he's the first person to ever know it,

1388
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:36,419
and he's gotta run around telling everybody.

1389
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:38,521
He's like, "hey, Dan, did you know that your head

1390
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:40,623
is 20% of your body weight?"

1391
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:44,627
And I wanted to check to see if he was right,

1392
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:46,629
so I tried to weigh my head.

1393
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:49,932
I don't know if you've tried that,

1394
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:52,502
but you can't see how much it weighs.

1395
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:53,736
(audience laughs)

1396
01:02:53,769 --> 01:02:55,738
Doesn't work, I just kept going.

1403

- Boys! Boys!

1407
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:34,277
Oh, no, you don't, not on my watch.

1408
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:35,144
- Dad!

1409
01:03:36,445 --> 01:03:38,414
Uh, we were just messing around.

1410
01:03:38,447 --> 01:03:39,482
- I can see that.

1411
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:41,384
Johnny, go home this instant.

1412
01:03:43,853 --> 01:03:46,756
As for you, mister, you're getting the bong.

1413
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:49,525
- Okay.

1414
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:54,564
- Honey, bring me my 5-foot matrix, pronto!

1415
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:57,133
- By now you've heard the exciting news

1416
01:03:57,166 --> 01:04:00,903
that smoking pot cures most forms of homosexuality.

1417
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:02,438
And I'm living proof.

1418
01:04:02,471 --> 01:04:06,375
I'm Reginald Stevens, and I used to be a flaming queen.

1419
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:08,611
But after smoking ganja daily,

1420
01:04:08,644 --> 01:04:11,080
I'm as straight as Cher's pubes.

1421
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:13,015
So think about it, moms and dads.

1422
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:16,986
Do you want your boy smoking pot or smoking cock?

1423
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:20,189
- I know where we stand.

1424
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:25,494
- It's time to talk to your kids about marijuana

1425
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:28,698
and vote yes on Prop. 420.

1426
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:33,069
So light up, America, and put out the flame.

1427
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:33,936
- And cut!

1428
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:37,940
(bell ringing)

1429
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,548
- Ugh!

1430
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:46,949
- Is that true?

1431
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:48,985
Pot really made you straight?

1432
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:49,952
- Yeah.

1433
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:51,120
- For how long?

1434
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:52,521
- Since lunch, girl.

1435
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:56,125
- Oh, you're terrible. - A girl's got to eat, Dwayne.

1436
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:57,727
- Then there was that commercial, they're like,

1437
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:58,961
"If you smoke pot,

1438
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:01,564
you've helped murder families in Columbia."

1439
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:03,699
And I'm just sitting at home going, "what?

1440
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:09,071
I've never even been to Ohio, dude."

1441
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:11,941
(audience laughs)

1442
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:21,517
♪ Different tokes ♪ (audience cheers and applauds)

1443
01:05:22,718 --> 01:05:25,321
- Mark, Brian, would you dispose of this?

1444
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:26,889
- Affirmative, ma'am.

1445
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:29,492
- Exiting with the ganja.

1446
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:33,462
(audience cheers and applauds)

1447
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:38,334
- Are we in trouble?

1448
01:05:39,535 --> 01:05:40,970
- No, Mikey.

1449
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:43,806
But if you keep messing with that stuff...

1450
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:46,842
You sure will be.

1451
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:49,111
- I didn't want to try it, Mrs. President.

1452
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:51,080
I knew it was a bad idea.

1453
01:05:53,749 --> 01:05:55,685
- But did you know why, Mikey?

1454
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:58,988
- No, not really.

1455
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:04,560
- Marijuana is a drug, Mikey, and drugs are bad for people.

1456
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:09,031
Smoking marijuana will get you put in jail,

1457
01:06:09,065 --> 01:06:10,866
give you brain damage,

1458
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:14,136
and if you take one puff, you'll never be happy again.

1459
01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:18,441
- Like my real mama, the crack ho?

1460
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:22,278
(audience laughs and applauds)

1461
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:23,879
- Even worse than the crack ho.

1462
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:27,983
Just say "not" to pot!

1463
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:31,020
(audience applauds)

1464
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:38,160
(audience cheers)

1465
01:06:38,194 --> 01:06:39,028
- Hey, Mikey.

1466
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:41,764
- Hey, Todd.

1467
01:06:41,797 --> 01:06:43,766
The president's wife here was just telling me

1468
01:06:43,799 --> 01:06:45,501
all about marijuana.

1469
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:47,203
- Well, it's not for kids.

1470
01:06:47,236 --> 01:06:49,805
Well, your age I mean.

1471
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,173
But you know what?

1472
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:52,908
If you want to try it when you're older,

1473
01:06:52,942 --> 01:06:55,177
think about it like it's ice cream.

1474
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:57,279
It's a great treat. - We've got a code red!

1475
01:06:57,313 --> 01:07:00,216
- But too much of anything can make you feel icky.

1476
01:07:02,017 --> 01:07:05,521
- Actually, Todd, we were just discussing

1477
01:07:05,554 --> 01:07:09,558
how you should never use marijuana because it will kill you.

1478
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:12,728
Therefore potheads are suicidal morons!

1479
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:14,263
(audience laughs)

1480
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:15,064
- Really?

1481
01:07:15,097 --> 01:07:16,265
- Mm-hmm.

1482
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:17,266
- 'Cause that's not what my pro-pot

1483
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:19,268
republican friend, Craig X says.

1484
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:22,037
- Just to introduce myself, this is Reverend Craig X

1485
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:24,473
from Temple 420, the General Farmer,

1486
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:26,509
out here fighting the good fight

1487
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:28,978
in this civil war we call the drug war.

1488
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:30,913
And whether it's, like, a Jewish wedding

1489
01:07:30,946 --> 01:07:33,048
or a Christian wedding, we turn it around.

1490
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:35,484
Here's the christian side, it could be a podium,

1491
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:37,219
There's the Jewish side.

1492
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:38,888
And what's so great about temple 420

1493
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:40,423
is you don't have to lie.

1494
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:43,125
You don't have to go, "Oh, dude, I'm sick, I need weed."

1495
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:45,761
Now you can say, "hey, I love the Lord,

1496
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:47,630
and I think cannabis is a sacrament."

1497
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:50,499
This is a spiritual inhalation device.

1498
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:54,737
We pack our bowl with the sacramental herb,

1499
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:56,839
the burning bush, and then we burn it,

1500
01:07:56,872 --> 01:07:59,341
filtering it through a water filtration system,

1501
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:01,010
and this is a pull stem.

1502
01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:04,447
"And that every beast of the earth and every fowl of the air

1503
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,449
and everything that creepeth upon the earth

1504
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:07,917
wherein there is life.

1505
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:10,586
I have given you every green herb from me."

1506
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:12,721
God bless, amen, I'm outta here.

1507
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:16,892
- Craig. (audience cheers)

1508
01:08:19,094 --> 01:08:22,031
- Actually, Mrs. President, even the long-term smoking,

1509
01:08:22,064 --> 01:08:24,266
the daily long-term smoking of marijuana

1510
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:27,169
doesn't lead to long-term damage to the brain.

1511
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:28,471
The studies that show it leads

1512
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:31,207
to short-term loss of memory are false.

1513
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:32,775
What the study actually was,

1514
01:08:32,808 --> 01:08:34,376
was they were giving a rhesus monkey

1515
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:37,646
with a tiny, little head a quarter pound of marijuana

1516
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:38,881
to smoke in an hour.

1517
01:08:38,914 --> 01:08:40,316
Even I'd pass out.

1518
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:42,017
The fact is, a lot of intellectuals,

1519
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:44,053
including astronomer Carl Sagan

1520
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:46,455
and conservative pundit William F. Buckley

1521
01:08:46,489 --> 01:08:47,823
are both pro pot.

1522
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:49,024
(audience applauds)

1523
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:49,959
- well, Mikey, it just goes to show you,

1524
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:51,560
you can always find a whack job

1525
01:08:51,594 --> 01:08:53,996
to back up any kind of hooey. (chuckles)

1526
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:56,131
But facts are facts, and smoking marijuana

1527
01:08:56,165 --> 01:08:58,334
leads to harder, more dangerous drugs.

1528
01:08:58,367 --> 01:09:02,338
- Your harder drugs theory doesn't really apply.

1529
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:04,006
- Well, it kills your immune system,

1530
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:06,475
and the way you hippie communists smoke it

1531
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:08,043
makes it 400 times more likely

1532
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:10,579
to lead to cancer than tobacco!

1533
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:12,381
- Well, anytime you consume

1534
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:15,751
a non-completely-combusted hydrocarbonate it's carcinogenic.

1535
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:17,720
But marijuana is medicine,

1536
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:19,822
or why else would doctors be prescribing it

1537
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:21,857
to people with cancer and AIDS?

1538
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:24,593
- Well, Mr. Smartass, why don't you just take all

1539
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:27,296
your fucking facts and figures to Amsterdam, hmm?

1540
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:29,598
- Okay, the first lady just said, "fuck."

1541
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:31,367
- Those godless faggots legalized pot.

1542
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,835
You know what happened to them?

1543
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:34,703
- Yeah, better call GLAAD

1544
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:36,972
and tell 'em she said "maggot," not "faggot."

1545
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:39,909
- Nothing but dope fiends and taxes through the roof!

1546
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:42,878
- Are you drunk?

1547
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:43,812
(audience cheers)

1548
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,080
- Listen, you little punk!

1549
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:46,582
I'm the goddamn leader of the free world,

1550
01:09:46,615 --> 01:09:48,551
and when I drink, it's to relax and have fun!

1551
01:09:48,584 --> 01:09:50,286
Not like you reefer addicts

1552
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:51,787
that are out smoking and getting high!

1553
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:53,489
I am the president's wife, and I am in charge here,

1554
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:56,392
and it's my way or the highway!

1555
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:58,627
You know, this is funny shit.

1556
01:09:58,661 --> 01:09:59,995
Where are my laughs?

1557
01:10:01,397 --> 01:10:03,632
- The first lady's been mixing Vicodin and scotch again.

1558
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:04,567
Ma'am!

1559
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,035
Give me all the goddamn tape!

1560
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:07,870
- Mrs. President! - Code bitch, code bitch!

1561
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:08,904
I want all the tape!

1562
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:10,139
I want all those tapes!

1563
01:10:10,172 --> 01:10:12,608
- I know how to make people disappear!

1564
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:14,310
(secret service shouting)

1565
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:15,578
It's too early for bed!

1566
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:16,545
(audience cheers and applauds)

1567
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:18,347
I don't want to go to bed!

1568
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,582
- Ma'am, ma'am, put your legs together.

1569
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:21,584
- Just say "not" to pot!

1570
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:23,886
- They can see your panties, ma'am.

1571
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:26,388
(Mrs. President shouting)

1572
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:29,959
- "My, (laughs) god damn, buddy.

1573
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:32,761
That is some good weed you got there."

1574
01:10:32,795 --> 01:10:35,497
He said, "yeah, Doug and Sue gave me an ounce of this.

1575
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:40,302
It's for my wedding gift, it's from Nepal, N-E-P-A-L."

1576
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:44,340
Nepal's a little country between India and China.

1577
01:10:44,373 --> 01:10:45,874
It's where the Himalayan Mountains are,

1578
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:48,744
and in Nepal, marijuana's been legal

1579
01:10:48,777 --> 01:10:53,749
for a little over 5,000 years of recorded history,

1580
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:56,485
and they're out there

1581
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:58,887
talking to god with this shit, all right,

1582
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:01,423
and my best friend's got an ounce of it.

1583
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:05,828
So we roll one skinny, little, toothpick-size number

1584
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:07,696
of that Nepalese weed.

1585
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:10,599
The first hit on the number,

1586
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:14,169
my wife hits the ground in her formal dress.

1587
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:18,641
(audience laughs)

1588
01:11:18,674 --> 01:11:20,409
Here, here, give me that.

1589
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:21,510
(audience laughs)

1590
01:11:21,543 --> 01:11:22,611
Give me that.

1591
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:31,654
I tell you, that's some good shit, isn't it?

1592
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:33,222
- [Interviewer] You have a cat?

1593
01:11:33,255 --> 01:11:34,256
- Yeah, I have a cat.

1594
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,824
This is his litter box.

1595
01:11:35,858 --> 01:11:37,326
Reefer!

1596
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:38,694
I'll inhale and shit, and he just stands there, and, like,

1597
01:11:38,727 --> 01:11:41,130
it's obvious that he likes reefer.

1598
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:42,965
Where's, come here, I'll show Reefer.

1599
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:48,671
Come on, Reefer, meow meow, Reefer!

1600
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:52,708
You see Reefer?

1601
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:55,678
You know what, he probably smoked

1602
01:11:55,711 --> 01:11:58,080
not that long ago, actually, you can tell by his eyes.

1603
01:11:58,113 --> 01:11:59,982
Oh, that's my weed tits.

1604
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,818
- [Interviewer] Your weed tits?

1605
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:04,086
- Yeah, it's my weed tits.

1606
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:05,454
I keep my weed in here.

1607
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:10,092
- [Interviewer] Oh, that's brilliant.

1608
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:12,027
- It's a great stash place for my weed.

1609
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:16,365
Weed tits.

1610
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:20,803
The interesting thing, and what most people are unaware of,

1611
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:22,371
is that in the early 20th century,

1612
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:25,374
marijuana was fairly prevalent, much like alcohol.

1613
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:28,377
You could go to your local jazz scene and score pot.

1614
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:30,179
It was known as muggles back then.

1615
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:33,348
Not until the 1920s when Mayor La Guardia

1616
01:12:33,382 --> 01:12:37,686
initiated the Marijuana Stamp Act did it become a problem.

1617
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,722
And what it required the citizens to do

1618
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:42,491
was to go into the government building with their marijuana,

1619
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:45,160
thus, entrapping them, because they hadn't had a stamp

1620
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:46,895
for the marijuana they brought in.

1621
01:12:54,069 --> 01:12:56,872
(smoker coughing)

1622
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:18,927
Because after that, no one fucking could get a stamp.

1623
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:21,363

01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:56,758

01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:11,039
Morphine just makes me sick!

- Morphine? - Yeah!

1662
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:14,343
- Don't make it worse, lady!

1663
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:16,612
You have a right to remain silent, anything-

1664
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:21,750
- Why is this shit illegal again?

1665
01:15:21,783 --> 01:15:23,452
- I told you already.

1666
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:25,120
- Just tell me again.

1667
01:15:25,153 --> 01:15:27,456
- Because William Randolph Hearst and Pierre Du Pont

1668
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:30,692
had a lot of money invested in paper and petrochemicals,

1669
01:15:30,726 --> 01:15:31,994
and they didn't like the competition

1670
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:33,862
from safer and cheaper hemp products,

1671
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:35,497
so Hearst spent the next 20 years

1672
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:37,666
demonizing cannabis in his newspapers

1673
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:40,702
in an effort to manipulate public policy against the plant,

1674
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:43,405
ultimately tricking the United States Congress

1675
01:15:43,438 --> 01:15:45,707
into passing anti-marijuana legislation,

1676
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:48,076
despite the staunch protest of every major,

1677
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:50,045
major medical group in the country!

1678
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:55,484
- But why is this shit illegal?

1679
01:15:55,517 --> 01:15:57,219
- I don't know if pot is a drug.

1680
01:15:57,252 --> 01:15:59,187
A drug is when you take a plant

1681
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:02,391
and you ship it off to a pharmaceutical company in Germany

1682
01:16:02,424 --> 01:16:05,360
from the same people that made Zyklon B death gas,

1683
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:09,765
and they bring you back a chalky, powdery, white pill

1684
01:16:09,798 --> 01:16:11,733
that needs another pill to undo the damage of

1685
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:14,236
that your HMO can't afford.

1686
01:16:14,269 --> 01:16:15,671
Then it's a drug.

1696
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:38,694
- I freelanced for over 4,000 years.

1697
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:41,863
until Morgan fucking Freeman came along.

1698
01:16:41,897 --> 01:16:44,032
- "The Shawshank Redemption."

1699
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:48,837
- "In 1966, Andy Dufresne left Shawshank Prison

1700
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:52,574
with nothing but a set of muddy prison clothes, a lead pipe,

1701
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:55,577
and a rock hammer nearly worn down to the nub."

1702
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,547
- Wow, you sound just like him!

1703
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:00,682
- I did the fucking table read.

1704
01:17:00,716 --> 01:17:01,516
- Jeez.

1705
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:06,955
- Because William Randolph Hearst.

1706
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:08,190
- Then I went corporate.

1707
01:17:09,491 --> 01:17:12,461
Kids, I needed the stability.

1708
01:17:12,494 --> 01:17:13,962
- Tell me about it.

1709
01:17:13,996 --> 01:17:17,099
I was a struggling magician before Gina was born.

1710
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:20,235
- Oh, the sacrifices we make for our children.

1711
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:24,840
Speaking of which, "your daughter, Lolita,

1712
01:17:24,873 --> 01:17:28,043
is about to climb out of her bedroom window."

1713

- Oh, interestingly, I wouldn't say

1716
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:39,021
that it's lowered my sexual inhibitions

1717
01:17:39,054 --> 01:17:42,391
as much as made sex more enjoyable!

1718
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:44,760

I was wrongly grounded, so I'm leaving.

1731

I have a party to go to.

1732
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,136
- Honey, I believe you about the pot.

1733
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:30,405
Now, please come back inside.

1734
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:32,507

1735
01:18:33,775 --> 01:18:37,479
The, narrator told me that some idiot

1736
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:40,148
stuck it in your purse during a party.

1737
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:41,616
- Oh.

1738
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,885
Well, then why can't I leave?

1739
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:44,753
- Sit down.

1740
01:18:49,091 --> 01:18:53,795
Now, before I tell you why you can't leave,

1741
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:55,931
I think it's important that you know

1742
01:18:55,964 --> 01:19:00,902
that I am really, really high right now.

1743
01:19:02,037 --> 01:19:03,371
- You're high?

1744
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:04,239
- Yes.

1745
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:07,309
And that doesn't mean I'm proud of it,

1746
01:19:09,778 --> 01:19:12,280
any more than I'm proud of all the drinking I did

1747
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:14,316
before the brownies kicked in.

1748
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:18,520
- My dad ate pot brownies?

1749
01:19:18,553 --> 01:19:19,654
- Oh, four.

1750
01:19:19,688 --> 01:19:21,757
And when you're old enough,

1751
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:23,492
you can decide to break the law

1752
01:19:23,525 --> 01:19:25,894
and eat four pot brownies too.

1753
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:26,828
- I can?

1754
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:28,063
- When you're old enough,

1755
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:31,433
old enough to decide what's right for you.

1756
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:32,868
- Well, how old is that?

1757
01:19:32,901 --> 01:19:33,869
- 57.

1758
01:19:34,936 --> 01:19:36,605
- (chuckles) Dad.

1759
01:19:36,638 --> 01:19:38,807
- But right now, you're still my little girl.

1760
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,308
You're still growing. - I know.

1761
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:43,545
- And you've got to take care of yourself.

1762
01:19:43,578 --> 01:19:46,882
So no drugs, alcohol or otherwise.

1763
01:19:46,915 --> 01:19:50,352
no unsafe sex, no sex at all.

1764
01:19:50,385 --> 01:19:52,254
Plenty of fruits and vegetables.

1765

01:19:58,160 --> 01:19:59,094
I love you, dad.

1768
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:00,295
- I love you too.

1769
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:05,534
- So now, why can't I leave?

1770
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:08,803
The party's so lame.

1771
01:20:08,837 --> 01:20:10,572
- I kinda like it.

01:20:10,605 --> 01:20:15,610

on the run from the police and they're holding us hostage

1803

until they think it's safe to go.

1804
01:21:46,935 --> 01:21:51,072

01:28:20,261 --> 01:28:25,199
- I was singing, pardon my voice, but,

1950
01:28:25,233 --> 01:28:28,269
♪ I'm a joker, I'm a smoker, I'm a midnight toker ♪

1951
01:28:28,302 --> 01:28:31,673
The Steve Miller song and my little son, Justin says,

1952
01:28:31,706 --> 01:28:33,808
"Daddy, what's a toker?"

1953
01:28:33,841 --> 01:28:35,209
And now we have a movie.

1954
01:28:35,243 --> 01:28:38,346
Of course in the film, my son Justin

1955
01:28:38,379 --> 01:28:40,648
is now a 15 year old hottie

1956
01:28:40,682 --> 01:28:43,451
where they find a roach in her birth control pills.

1957
01:28:43,484 --> 01:28:45,486
So we figured that would be much more sexy

1958
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:48,890
than a seven-year-old finding marijuana

1959
01:28:48,923 --> 01:28:50,491
in his Thomas the Tank Engine.

1960
01:28:50,525 --> 01:28:53,795
- [Director] So this movie had a lot of close calls

1961
01:28:53,828 --> 01:28:56,597
and a lot of signs from God,

1962
01:28:56,631 --> 01:28:58,766
kind of miracles coming together.

1963
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:01,903
- Every single thing that happened in this movie

1964
01:29:01,936 --> 01:29:06,941
was amazing how it was just all kind of came into place

1965
01:29:07,742 --> 01:29:09,644
in very strange ways.

1966
01:29:09,677 --> 01:29:13,114
Like the character of Bertman, the lead character,

1967
01:29:13,147 --> 01:29:15,850
the lead debater whose daughter is found with the roach,

1968
01:29:15,883 --> 01:29:17,885
that was originally written for me.

1969
01:29:17,919 --> 01:29:20,088
- And the director, Lee Abbott, was smart enough to say,

1970
01:29:20,121 --> 01:29:22,423
well, you're really not this guy, you play the narrator.

1971
01:29:22,457 --> 01:29:25,860
And at first I was going, he's throwing me out,

1972
01:29:25,893 --> 01:29:26,794
he's just playing with me now.

1973
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:30,498
But then I really got into the Narrator character,

1974
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:33,101
I got to explore a different type.

1975
01:29:33,134 --> 01:29:35,570
We assembled this cast that just ended up together,

1976
01:29:35,603 --> 01:29:37,071
a lot of friends.

1977
01:29:37,105 --> 01:29:39,974
Everybody does everything on this movie, all hats are worn.

1978
01:29:40,007 --> 01:29:42,577
As a matter of fact, Kelly, has doubled as craft services,

1979
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:43,978
thank you for the pretzels, by the way.

1980
01:29:44,011 --> 01:29:45,413
- No problem, No problem.

1981
01:29:45,446 --> 01:29:47,782
I like to bring the pretzels, they eat a lot of those,

1982
01:29:47,815 --> 01:29:49,383
you know, cheese and crackers.

1983
01:29:49,417 --> 01:29:50,418
- [Waiter] Gentlemen,

1984
01:29:51,853 --> 01:29:55,490
- Low budget and all we get is cheese and fucking crackers.

1985
01:29:55,523 --> 01:29:59,360
In Hollywood we're literally referred to as the slam dunk.

1986
01:29:59,393 --> 01:30:00,862
When you bring in Mark and Brian,

1987
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:02,597
it's a slam dunk, it's a win.

1988
01:30:02,630 --> 01:30:03,998
It's a win-win for everybody involved.

1989
01:30:04,031 --> 01:30:05,333
- Craig Shoemaker calls us up and said,

1990
01:30:05,366 --> 01:30:06,834
dude, it's just, I don't know what I'm doing.

1991
01:30:06,868 --> 01:30:08,870
You know, I wrote this thing and I thought it was funny

1992
01:30:08,903 --> 01:30:10,338
and now I know it's a piece of shit.

1993
01:30:10,371 --> 01:30:12,840
It's piece of shit, I need the old slam dunks.

1994
01:30:14,275 --> 01:30:15,443
- [Interviewer] What kind of movie is "Totally Baked."

1995
01:30:15,476 --> 01:30:18,546
- "Totally Baked," the original concept,

1996
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:20,615
which we're hoping ends up on the screen,

1997
01:30:20,648 --> 01:30:24,919
is this body romp in finding the truth about marijuana

1998
01:30:24,952 --> 01:30:27,989
and the truth about marijuana is it depends who you ask.

1999
01:30:28,022 --> 01:30:28,823
- [Interviewer] Tell me about the first time

2000
01:30:28,856 --> 01:30:30,258
you ever got stoned.

2001
01:30:30,291 --> 01:30:34,162
- So we went to the carwash and my mother had this

2002
01:30:34,195 --> 01:30:37,131
beautiful blue Malibu Classic, 1976 Chevrolet.

2003
01:30:37,165 --> 01:30:40,434
We were both 14 or 15 and I was newly experienced driving

2004
01:30:40,468 --> 01:30:42,170
and I don't think Chris had driven at all.

2005
01:30:42,203 --> 01:30:44,172
At some point I said, hey man, back the car up,

2006
01:30:44,205 --> 01:30:46,307
I need to vacuum it out and he got in the car

2007
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:48,142
and instead of hitting the brake he hit the accelerator

2008
01:30:48,176 --> 01:30:49,610
while the door was open.

2009
01:30:49,644 --> 01:30:51,179
And it was like a slow motion movie,

2010
01:30:51,212 --> 01:30:54,215
the door just ripped right off on the pole.

2011
01:30:54,248 --> 01:30:56,684
And there I was just standing there with his beautiful car,

2012
01:30:56,717 --> 01:30:58,386
it was just destroyed.

2013
01:30:58,419 --> 01:31:00,888
Which is probably not a good pot story, but it's, you know,

2014
01:31:00,922 --> 01:31:02,857
maybe that's because the 14 year olds

2015
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:04,459
shouldn't necessarily smoke.

2016
01:31:04,492 --> 01:31:07,929
But so anyway, I went home and my parents found everything.

2017
01:31:07,962 --> 01:31:10,097
- I think a senior in high school

2018
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:14,635
at my house in the living room, mom was at work.

2019
01:31:14,669 --> 01:31:16,604
And I think we had tried one, or I tried once before

2020
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:18,039
and I didn't get high.

2021
01:31:18,072 --> 01:31:20,408
So we're smoking at this time and I'm looking at Chris

2022
01:31:20,441 --> 01:31:22,043
and I'm going, man, I don't think this is working,

2023
01:31:22,076 --> 01:31:23,744
I'm not high.

2024
01:31:23,778 --> 01:31:25,880
I said, but you know, I'm gonna go get some eat.

2025
01:31:25,913 --> 01:31:28,583
Chris said I was in the kitchen for about 20 minutes

2026
01:31:28,616 --> 01:31:30,518
banging pots and dishes.

2027
01:31:30,551 --> 01:31:32,053
And I finally come out

2028
01:31:32,086 --> 01:31:34,222
and I'm holding three slices of bread.

2029
01:31:34,255 --> 01:31:35,923
Chris goes, what do you got there, man?

2030
01:31:35,957 --> 01:31:40,428
I said, you got a bread sandwich. (laughs)

2031
01:31:40,461 --> 01:31:42,997
- We went over to this guy's house and he produced this,

2032
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:45,867
like something you'd seen a centerfold of High Times.

2033
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:49,136
And they had one of those gravity bong looking huge things

2034
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:52,673
and, I mean, they were taking a lot and I took one big hit.

2035
01:31:52,707 --> 01:31:55,076
Had a few drinks and then next thing I know, I wake up

2036
01:31:55,109 --> 01:31:57,445
and I think I've been buried alive

2037
01:31:57,478 --> 01:31:59,714
because I'm in a room it's pitch black,

2038
01:31:59,747 --> 01:32:02,250
I mean there is no light and I don't know where I am.

2039
01:32:02,283 --> 01:32:04,118
I can feel I'm like on a couch

2040
01:32:04,151 --> 01:32:06,654
but then I stand up and I like trip over all their shit

2041
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:09,790
and fall into like a shelf and all these boxes fall on me.

2042
01:32:09,824 --> 01:32:12,560
Then I get up and I'm like, I'm on like a lawn mower.

2043
01:32:12,593 --> 01:32:14,695
And I just start feeling around

2044
01:32:14,729 --> 01:32:16,931
and eventually I feel this wall and I'm like,

2045
01:32:16,964 --> 01:32:19,834
that feels like a garage door, I'm in somebody's garage.

2046
01:32:19,867 --> 01:32:22,303
- We had an ordered a pizza like earlier in the day

2047
01:32:22,336 --> 01:32:23,905
and then there's people over,

2048
01:32:23,938 --> 01:32:25,539
it was kind of like we were having a little party.

2049
01:32:25,573 --> 01:32:28,476
And then we noticed that there was ants attacking the pizza.

2050
01:32:28,509 --> 01:32:30,912
So we got Raid and we sprayed it all over the pizza.

2051
01:32:30,945 --> 01:32:32,947
Like literally drenched the pizza in Raid,

2052
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:34,015
I'm not kidding, it as disgusting,

2053
01:32:34,048 --> 01:32:35,549
there was dead ants everywhere.

2054
01:32:35,583 --> 01:32:37,552
The pizza was just covered in dead ants.

2055
01:32:37,585 --> 01:32:39,053
So then about four o'clock in the morning,

2056
01:32:39,086 --> 01:32:42,490
she wakes up and she's starving and she needs some food.

2057
01:32:42,523 --> 01:32:43,691
And actually, we were still

2058
01:32:43,724 --> 01:32:45,192
pretty much all awake at this time.

2059
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:46,961
So she's going through the kitchen and she's like,

2060
01:32:46,994 --> 01:32:47,929
oh yeah, the pizza.

2061
01:32:47,962 --> 01:32:49,096
Starts eating the pizza.

2062
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:51,332
She's on her second piece of pizza

2063
01:32:51,365 --> 01:32:53,935
and she's eating the last bite of her second piece

2064
01:32:53,968 --> 01:32:56,971
and our friend goes, where did get that pizza?

2065
01:32:57,004 --> 01:32:58,172
And she's like, it's in the kitchen.

2066
01:32:58,205 --> 01:33:00,341
But we were all like, no!

2067
01:33:00,374 --> 01:33:02,810
And the poor girl was like throwing up, it was disgusting.

2068
01:33:02,843 --> 01:33:05,079
She was crying, there was ants all over her tongue.

2069
01:33:05,112 --> 01:33:06,914
It was nasty.

2070
01:33:06,948 --> 01:33:08,115
So we had to call poison control and stuff

2071
01:33:08,149 --> 01:33:09,617
but it was pretty fun.

2072
01:33:09,650 --> 01:33:13,387
- I tried smoking marijuana and it gave me the shits.

2073
01:33:15,089 --> 01:33:16,490
You remember that. - I do.

2074
01:33:16,524 --> 01:33:17,959
- 'Cause he was trying to,

2075
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:22,830
it was back when we were in college and he smoked a lot.

2076
01:33:22,863 --> 01:33:24,365
- You know, college.

2077
01:33:24,398 --> 01:33:25,733
- And every time he did the first thing he wanted to do

2078
01:33:25,766 --> 01:33:27,568
was just stick it in somebody's ass.

2079
01:33:28,970 --> 01:33:31,739
And we being roommates and everything sometimes,

2080
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:37,378
you know, I'd be sleeping and I wake up like that, anyways.

2081
01:33:37,411 --> 01:33:38,879
- Hey, what's that?

2082
01:33:38,913 --> 01:33:40,881
- So I tried smoking at one time and I got the shits.

2083
01:33:40,915 --> 01:33:41,949
- Yeah, you did.

2084
01:33:41,983 --> 01:33:43,150
- Bad. - I remember that.

2085
01:33:43,184 --> 01:33:44,752
- So I never really got into that very much.

2086
01:33:44,785 --> 01:33:46,988
I mean, I had a couple of times,

2087
01:33:47,021 --> 01:33:50,992
and it was just kind of, you know, I didn't inhale, please.

2088
01:33:52,393 --> 01:33:54,929
But you know, I never got kind of beyond, well,

2089
01:33:54,962 --> 01:33:58,566
let's go and have Haagen-Daz and pizza in that order.

2090
01:34:00,101 --> 01:34:03,537
- The smell of pot reminds me of a good rock concert.

2091
01:34:03,571 --> 01:34:05,706
- This is all make believe.

2092
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:10,745
I've never inhaled any marijuana, so I really haven't.

2093
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:13,681
I really have not.

2094
01:34:15,116 --> 01:34:19,253
I have had a brownie or two in my life, but I was tricked.

2095
01:34:19,286 --> 01:34:20,688
I didn't know.

2096
01:34:20,721 --> 01:34:22,890
- I've had some dalliances with the demon weed.

2097
01:34:22,923 --> 01:34:25,326
I wouldn't put a judgment on it for too long,

2098
01:34:25,359 --> 01:34:27,395
but for certainly a chunk of time

2099
01:34:27,428 --> 01:34:30,398
when I was out of high school, living in Manhattan,

2100
01:34:30,431 --> 01:34:33,300
studying acting, waiting tables,

2101
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:35,503
living in a fifth floor walk up.

2102
01:34:35,536 --> 01:34:38,005
Yeah, it was quite a help.

2103
01:34:38,039 --> 01:34:40,107
- Oh yeah, you know, they had it, they gave it to me

2104
01:34:40,141 --> 01:34:42,710
and I was just like, it finally hit me, I got stoned.

2105
01:34:42,743 --> 01:34:44,111
So now I can say I got stoned,

2106
01:34:44,145 --> 01:34:47,882
and I knew I was stoned because I laughed hysterically.

2107
01:34:47,915 --> 01:34:49,150
- And I started laughing,

2108
01:34:49,183 --> 01:34:51,152
and I laughed for about 20 minutes.

2109
01:34:51,185 --> 01:34:54,021
(actors laughing)

2110
01:35:01,062 --> 01:35:02,496
- Stop!

2111
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:07,001
Stop, you're killing me, you're killing me! (laughs)

2112
01:35:13,507 --> 01:35:17,211
- I hope you like the movie, we had fun making it.

2113
01:35:17,244 --> 01:35:22,249
(rock music) (bong water bubbling)
