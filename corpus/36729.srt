1
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:02,287
Honey, have you seen my wallet?

2
00:01:03,532 --> 00:01:05,841
lsn't it on the bedside table?

3
00:01:12,132 --> 00:01:14,520
Now listen, we' re running a little late.

4
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:15,721
l know.

5
00:01:16,412 --> 00:01:17,730
How do l look?

6
00:01:17,931 --> 00:01:19,330
Perfect.

7
00:01:19,572 --> 00:01:21,163
ls my hair okay?

8
00:01:21,611 --> 00:01:22,727
lt's great.

9
00:01:22,972 --> 00:01:24,927
You' re not even looking at it.

10
00:01:26,092 --> 00:01:27,491
lt's beautiful.

11
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:29,524
You always look beautiful.

12
00:01:30,012 --> 00:01:31,967
Did you give Roz the phone
and pager numbers?

13
00:01:32,171 --> 00:01:34,526
Yeah, l put it on the fridge.
Let's go.

14
00:01:34,731 --> 00:01:35,687
Coming.

15
00:01:36,572 --> 00:01:38,050
All right.

16
00:01:38,292 --> 00:01:39,441
l' m ready.

17
00:01:55,771 --> 00:01:57,409
What's the babysitter's name?

18
00:01:57,611 --> 00:01:58,521
Roz.

19
00:02:01,012 --> 00:02:03,685
Okay, Roz, we' re going now.

20
00:02:04,252 --> 00:02:06,606
You look amazing, Mrs. Harford.

21
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:09,042
Thank you.
Helena, are you ready for bed?

22
00:02:09,252 --> 00:02:11,765
Yes, Mommy. Can l stay up
and watch The Nutcracker?

23
00:02:12,012 --> 00:02:13,808
-What time's it on?
-9:00.

24
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,520
-You can watch that.
-Can l stay up until you get home?

25
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:19,689
-No, darling.
-lt'll be a little late for that.

26
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,048
The phone number is on the fridge. . .

27
00:02:22,252 --> 00:02:24,812
. . .and there's food in there,
so help yourself.

28
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:26,689
We shouldn't be later than 1 :00.

29
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:29,491
-l'll hold our cab to take you home.
-Thanks, Dr. Harford.

30
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:31,010
You be good, baby.

31
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:34,491
-Good night, sweetheart.
-See you in the morning.

32
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:46,526
-Victor, lllona.
-Bill, Alice.

33
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:49,165
-Merry Christmas.
-Thank you for coming.

34
00:02:49,532 --> 00:02:53,810
-Thanks so much for coming.
-We wouldn't miss it for the world.

35
00:02:54,012 --> 00:02:56,970
Alice, look at you.
God, you' re absolutely stunning!

36
00:02:57,172 --> 00:02:59,002
l don't say that to all the women.
Do l?

37
00:02:59,211 --> 00:03:00,884
-Yes, he does.
-He does?

38
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:03,970
That osteopath you sent me to,
the guy that worked on my arm?

39
00:03:04,172 --> 00:03:07,403
-You ought to see my serve now.
-He's the top man in New York.

40
00:03:07,612 --> 00:03:10,000
l could have told you that,
looking at his bill.

41
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:12,521
Go inside, have a drink,
enjoy the party.

42
00:03:12,732 --> 00:03:15,326
l'll see you in a little bit.
Thanks for coming.

43
00:03:27,771 --> 00:03:29,728
Do you know anyone here?

44
00:03:31,012 --> 00:03:33,401
Not a soul.

45
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:45,209
Why do you think Ziegler invites us
to these things every year?

46
00:03:46,372 --> 00:03:50,649
This is what you get
for making house calls.

47
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:03,401
You see that guy at the piano?

48
00:04:04,572 --> 00:04:07,005
l went to medical school with him.

49
00:04:07,531 --> 00:04:08,487
Really?

50
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,040
He plays pretty good for a doctor.

51
00:04:14,812 --> 00:04:18,247
He's not a doctor. He dropped out.

52
00:04:21,252 --> 00:04:23,560
Ladies and gentlemen,
l hope you' re enjoying yourselves.

53
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:27,081
The band's going to take a break.
We'll be back in 1 0 minutes.

54
00:04:27,771 --> 00:04:28,726
Thank you.

55
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,449
Let's go over and say hello.

56
00:04:37,651 --> 00:04:39,961
l desperately need
to go to the bathroom.

57
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:44,005
You go and say hello, and l'll
meet you where? At the bar?

58
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,526
Good.

59
00:04:55,531 --> 00:04:56,930
Nightingale.

60
00:04:57,732 --> 00:04:58,846
Nick Nightingale!

61
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:01,242
Oh, my God! Bill.

62
00:05:01,732 --> 00:05:04,529
Bill Harford!
How the hell are you, buddy?

63
00:05:04,732 --> 00:05:08,007
-How long has it been?
-l don't know. 1 0 years?

64
00:05:08,211 --> 00:05:09,485
And a couple.

65
00:05:10,052 --> 00:05:11,803
-Do you have time for a drink?
-Sure.

66
00:05:15,771 --> 00:05:17,807
You haven't changed a bit.

67
00:05:18,012 --> 00:05:20,764
Thanks, l think.
So how you doing?

68
00:05:21,012 --> 00:05:23,572
Not too bad, you know. Not too bad.

69
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:25,966
l see you've become a pianist.

70
00:05:26,172 --> 00:05:28,605
Oh, yes, well, my friends call me that.

71
00:05:29,492 --> 00:05:31,925
How about you?
You still in the doctor business?

72
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:36,011
You know what they say:
''Once a doctor, always a doctor. ''

73
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:40,329
Yes, or in my case:
''Never a doctor, never a doctor. ''

74
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,440
l never did understand
why you walked away.

75
00:05:44,172 --> 00:05:46,401
lt's a nice feeling. l do it a lot.

76
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:47,761
Cheers.

77
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:51,608
Excuse me.
Nick, l need you a minute.

78
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:53,370
Be right with you.

79
00:05:53,572 --> 00:05:56,132
l gotta go do something.
lf l don't catch you later. . .

80
00:05:56,331 --> 00:05:59,961
. . .l'll be down at the Village
for two weeks at the Sonata Cafe.

81
00:06:00,172 --> 00:06:02,732
-Stop by if you get a chance.
-l'll be there.

82
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:06,365
-lt's great seeing you.
-Good seeing you too, man.

83
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:49,447
l think that's my glass.

84
00:06:49,651 --> 00:06:52,644
l' m absolutely certain of it.

85
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:09,925
My name is Sandor Szavost.
l' m Hungarian.

86
00:07:20,131 --> 00:07:22,441
My name is Alice Harford.

87
00:07:22,772 --> 00:07:24,727
l' m American.

88
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:27,202
Delighted to meet you, Alice.

89
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:33,283
Did you ever read the Latin poet Ovid
on The Art of Love?

90
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:38,802
Didn't he wind up all by himself. . .

91
00:07:39,412 --> 00:07:41,642
. . .crying his eyes out. . .

92
00:07:41,851 --> 00:07:45,447
. . .in some place
with a very bad climate?

93
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:49,409
But he also had a good time first.

94
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:52,081
A very good time.

95
00:07:54,451 --> 00:07:57,125
Are you here
with anyone tonight, Alice?

96
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:02,087
With my husband.

97
00:08:02,412 --> 00:08:04,288
Oh, how sad.

98
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:09,682
But then l' m sure he's the sort of man
who wouldn't mind if we danced.

99
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:16,447
What do you do, Alice?

100
00:08:16,971 --> 00:08:20,202
Well, at the moment. . .

101
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:23,246
. . .l' m looking for a job.

102
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:27,966
l used to manage
an art gallery in SoHo.

103
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:30,648
But it went broke.

104
00:08:32,652 --> 00:08:34,130
What a shame.

105
00:08:35,772 --> 00:08:38,206
l have some friends in the art game.

106
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,967
Perhaps l can be of some help.

107
00:08:44,572 --> 00:08:46,163
Thank you.

108
00:09:04,572 --> 00:09:06,129
Someone you know?

109
00:09:09,851 --> 00:09:11,443
My. . .

110
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:13,451
. . .husband.

111
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,844
Don't you think
one of the charms of marriage. . .

112
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:25,528
. . .is that it makes deception
a necessity for both parties?

113
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:31,759
May l ask why a beautiful woman. . .

114
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:35,767
. . .who could have any man in this room,
wants to be married?

115
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,523
Why wouldn't she?

116
00:09:42,251 --> 00:09:44,243
ls it as bad as that?

117
00:09:45,491 --> 00:09:47,767
As good as that.

118
00:09:48,491 --> 00:09:50,163
Do you know Nuala Windsor?

119
00:09:50,371 --> 00:09:54,808
No, and it's very lovely
to meet you both.

120
00:09:56,731 --> 00:09:58,687
How do you spell Nuala?

121
00:09:59,292 --> 00:10:04,001
N-U-A-L-A.

122
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:08,331
You don't remember me, do you?

123
00:10:09,451 --> 00:10:11,919
You were very kind to me once.

124
00:10:12,131 --> 00:10:15,726
Only once?
That sounds like a terrible oversight!

125
00:10:17,052 --> 00:10:21,091
l was doing a photo session
in Rockefeller Plaza. . .

126
00:10:21,292 --> 00:10:22,804
. . .on a very windy day. . .?

127
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:27,051
-And you got something in your eye.
-Just about half of Fifth Avenue.

128
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:30,807
You were such a gentleman!
You gave me your handkerchief. . .

129
00:10:31,052 --> 00:10:33,407
. . .which was also clean.

130
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:38,561
That is the kind of hero
l can be sometimes.

131
00:10:39,491 --> 00:10:42,484
You know why women used to get married,
don't you?

132
00:10:43,971 --> 00:10:46,087
Why don't you tell me?

133
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,605
lt was the only way they could
lose their virginity. . .

134
00:10:51,011 --> 00:10:54,447
. . .and be free to do
what they wanted with other men.

135
00:10:55,451 --> 00:10:57,567
The ones they really wanted.

136
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:03,962
Fascinating.

137
00:11:07,772 --> 00:11:11,366
Do you know what's so nice
about doctors?

138
00:11:12,932 --> 00:11:16,288
Usually a lot less than people imagine.

139
00:11:17,932 --> 00:11:20,446
They always seem so. . .

140
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:22,811
. . .knowledgeable.

141
00:11:23,772 --> 00:11:27,447
Oh, they are very knowledgeable. . .

142
00:11:27,652 --> 00:11:30,404
. . .about all sorts of things.

143
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,327
But l bet they work too hard.

144
00:11:34,812 --> 00:11:38,441
Just think of all they miss.

145
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,562
You' re probably right.

146
00:11:42,532 --> 00:11:47,128
Ladies, where exactly are we going?

147
00:11:47,772 --> 00:11:49,250
Exactly?

148
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:54,046
Where the rainbow ends.

149
00:11:54,611 --> 00:11:56,408
Where the rainbow ends?

150
00:11:56,611 --> 00:11:59,922
Don't you want to go
where the rainbow ends?

151
00:12:00,131 --> 00:12:03,090
Now that depends where that is.

152
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:04,884
Well, let's find out.

153
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,811
Excuse me, ladies.
Sorry, Dr. Harford.

154
00:12:08,052 --> 00:12:12,125
Could you come with me for a moment?
Something for Mr. Ziegler.

155
00:12:14,371 --> 00:12:15,486
Fine.

156
00:12:17,172 --> 00:12:18,524
To be continued?

157
00:12:40,412 --> 00:12:42,403
Bill, thanks for coming.

158
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:47,085
We had a little accident here.

159
00:12:47,451 --> 00:12:48,770
What happened?

160
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:51,123
Well, she was. . . .

161
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:55,605
She was shooting up
and she had a bad reaction.

162
00:12:57,371 --> 00:12:58,486
What did she take?

163
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:02,802
A speedball or a snowball
or whatever the hell they call it.

164
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:04,764
lt's heroin and coke.

165
00:13:07,611 --> 00:13:09,523
Heroin and coke?

166
00:13:11,932 --> 00:13:13,206
Anything else?

167
00:13:14,812 --> 00:13:17,928
We had a couple of drinks,
some champagne. That was it.

168
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:20,009
How long has she been like this?

169
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:23,524
Maybe five minutes, six minutes,
something like that.

170
00:13:23,731 --> 00:13:24,801
What's her name?

171
00:13:26,052 --> 00:13:27,086
Mandy.

172
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:38,048
Can you hear me, Mandy?

173
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:42,807
Can you hear me?
Move your head if you can hear me.

174
00:13:44,251 --> 00:13:47,210
Move your head if you can
hear me, Mandy. There you go.

175
00:13:47,412 --> 00:13:48,924
You can hear me.

176
00:13:49,131 --> 00:13:53,171
Can you open your eyes for me?
Mandy, can you do that?

177
00:13:53,851 --> 00:13:57,048
Let me see you open your eyes.
There you go, come on.

178
00:13:57,251 --> 00:14:00,129
Come on, look at me. Look at me.

179
00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:03,041
Look at me. Look at me.

180
00:14:03,851 --> 00:14:06,809
Look at me. Look at me, Mandy.

181
00:14:08,451 --> 00:14:09,361
Good.

182
00:14:10,812 --> 00:14:12,130
Good.

183
00:14:13,971 --> 00:14:17,168
l love Victor's art collection,
don't you?

184
00:14:20,932 --> 00:14:22,729
lt's wonderful.

185
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:27,044
Have you ever seen
his sculpture gallery?

186
00:14:31,172 --> 00:14:32,809
l haven't.

187
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:38,168
He has a wonderful collection
of Renaissance bronzes.

188
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:42,327
Do you like the period?

189
00:14:45,412 --> 00:14:47,004
l do.

190
00:14:47,611 --> 00:14:49,682
l adore it.

191
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:54,047
The sculpture gallery is upstairs.

192
00:14:55,451 --> 00:14:57,363
Would you like to see it?

193
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:02,049
l can show it to you.

194
00:15:05,491 --> 00:15:07,322
We won't be gone long.

195
00:15:14,451 --> 00:15:16,169
Maybe. . .

196
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:21,724
. . .not just. . .

197
00:15:22,851 --> 00:15:24,205
. . .now.

198
00:15:41,532 --> 00:15:45,605
That was really one hell
of a scare you gave us, kiddo.

199
00:15:47,132 --> 00:15:48,405
Sorry.

200
00:15:57,092 --> 00:15:59,083
How are you feeling now, Mandy?

201
00:16:01,051 --> 00:16:02,121
Better.

202
00:16:11,372 --> 00:16:15,650
You are a very, very lucky girl.

203
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:18,050
You know that?

204
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:21,724
l know.

205
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,961
You' re gonna be okay this time.

206
00:16:26,172 --> 00:16:29,288
But you can't keep doing this.

207
00:16:30,011 --> 00:16:31,444
You understand?

208
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:39,401
You' re going to need some rehab.
You know that, don't you?

209
00:16:41,132 --> 00:16:42,644
l know.

210
00:16:53,531 --> 00:16:54,520
Well, Victor. . .

211
00:16:56,612 --> 00:16:58,125
. . .l'll leave the rest to you.

212
00:16:58,332 --> 00:17:00,971
ls it okay if l dress her
and get her out of here?

213
00:17:01,172 --> 00:17:04,721
No, l'd keep her here
for another hour.

214
00:17:04,932 --> 00:17:06,365
Another hour?

215
00:17:07,971 --> 00:17:11,009
Then l'd have someone take her home.

216
00:17:16,811 --> 00:17:18,244
Good night, Mandy.

217
00:17:21,092 --> 00:17:23,208
l can't thank you enough for this.

218
00:17:23,932 --> 00:17:26,048
-You saved my ass.
-l' m glad l was here.

219
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:28,606
Bill, l probably. . . .

220
00:17:29,372 --> 00:17:32,807
l know l don't have to mention this. . .

221
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:35,805
. . .but this is just between us.

222
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,486
Of course.

223
00:17:38,011 --> 00:17:39,205
Thanks.

224
00:17:59,372 --> 00:18:03,762
l think l've had
a little too much champagne.

225
00:18:06,771 --> 00:18:10,208
l think l have to go
and find my husband now.

226
00:18:10,412 --> 00:18:14,848
But l' m sure he'll be all right
on his own a little longer.

227
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,611
Yes. . .

228
00:18:19,971 --> 00:18:21,529
. . .but will l?

229
00:18:22,172 --> 00:18:23,809
Of course you will.

230
00:18:28,731 --> 00:18:32,406
l really have to go.
l have to go.

231
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,329
You don't, you know.

232
00:18:35,971 --> 00:18:38,486
Yes, l do.

233
00:18:43,612 --> 00:18:45,364
l must see you again.

234
00:18:47,132 --> 00:18:49,599
-That's impossible.
-Why?

235
00:18:51,051 --> 00:18:52,723
Because. . .

236
00:18:55,211 --> 00:18:57,362
. . .l' m married.

237
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:01,010
Good morning, Lisa.

238
00:20:01,211 --> 00:20:03,248
Good morning, doctor.
Your mail.

239
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:06,250
Good. Please ask Janelle
to bring me my coffee.

240
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:08,009
-Sure.
-Thank you.

241
00:20:08,571 --> 00:20:11,404
-Good morning, Sarah.
-Good morning, doctor.

242
00:20:11,612 --> 00:20:14,523
'''Twas the night before Christmas,
when all through the house...

243
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:17,484
...not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse. ''

244
00:20:21,491 --> 00:20:23,960
Okay. That's fine.
You can put your gown on.

245
00:20:28,491 --> 00:20:30,130
Hold this for Mommy.

246
00:20:31,652 --> 00:20:33,369
Looking forward to Christmas?

247
00:20:34,412 --> 00:20:36,049
Does this hurt?

248
00:20:49,771 --> 00:20:51,000
Right there?

249
00:21:01,531 --> 00:21:03,363
Daddy's gonna like that.

250
00:21:04,051 --> 00:21:05,690
Very good choice.

251
00:21:06,451 --> 00:21:08,682
''--before me. . .

252
00:21:09,172 --> 00:21:13,926
. . .when l jump into my bed. ''

253
00:21:15,852 --> 00:21:19,845
We should call the Zieglers
and thank them for the party.

254
00:21:20,771 --> 00:21:22,523
l've taken care of that.

255
00:21:24,092 --> 00:21:25,411
Good.

256
00:21:26,211 --> 00:21:29,567
So how do you feel about wrapping
the rest of the presents?

257
00:21:31,172 --> 00:21:33,288
Let's do that tomorrow.

258
00:22:17,451 --> 00:22:19,488
Tell me something.

259
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:27,407
Those two girls. . .

260
00:22:29,172 --> 00:22:31,685
. . .at the party last night. . . .

261
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:39,202
Did you. . .

262
00:22:40,172 --> 00:22:42,446
. . .by any chance. . .

263
00:22:42,811 --> 00:22:45,041
. . .happen to. . .

264
00:22:46,652 --> 00:22:49,325
. . .fuck them?

265
00:22:51,852 --> 00:22:53,125
What?

266
00:22:55,971 --> 00:22:58,486
What are you talking about?

267
00:23:02,332 --> 00:23:05,846
l' m talking about the two girls. . .

268
00:23:06,132 --> 00:23:09,840
. . .that you were so blatantly
hitting on.

269
00:23:11,412 --> 00:23:14,403
l wasn't hitting on anybody.

270
00:23:17,332 --> 00:23:19,242
Who were they?

271
00:23:22,412 --> 00:23:25,926
They were just a couple of models.

272
00:23:29,811 --> 00:23:34,169
And where did you disappear to
with them for so long?

273
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:36,249
Wait a minute.

274
00:23:40,491 --> 00:23:44,279
l didn't disappear with anybody.

275
00:23:46,971 --> 00:23:49,486
Ziegler wasn't feeling too well. . .

276
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:53,045
. . .and l got called upstairs
to see him.

277
00:23:56,692 --> 00:23:59,525
Anyway, who was the guy
you were dancing with?

278
00:24:05,412 --> 00:24:08,210
A friend of the Zieglers.

279
00:24:10,811 --> 00:24:12,131
What did he want?

280
00:24:12,412 --> 00:24:14,323
What did he want?

281
00:24:20,811 --> 00:24:22,325
Sex. . .

282
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:26,163
. . .upstairs.

283
00:24:27,211 --> 00:24:29,009
Then and there.

284
00:24:31,332 --> 00:24:32,810
ls that all?

285
00:24:33,211 --> 00:24:35,601
Yeah, that was all.

286
00:24:35,811 --> 00:24:38,484
Just wanted to fuck my wife.

287
00:24:42,612 --> 00:24:44,090
That's right.

288
00:24:44,412 --> 00:24:46,606
Well, l guess that's understandable.

289
00:24:49,491 --> 00:24:51,561
Understandable?

290
00:24:52,412 --> 00:24:54,481
Because you are a very. . .

291
00:24:55,491 --> 00:24:57,561
. . .very beautiful woman.

292
00:25:00,531 --> 00:25:01,851
Wait.

293
00:25:05,692 --> 00:25:07,284
Because l' m a beautiful woman. . .

294
00:25:07,491 --> 00:25:11,609
. . .the only reason any man
ever wants to talk to me. . .

295
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:17,564
. . .is because he wants to fuck me.
ls that what you' re saying?

296
00:25:20,011 --> 00:25:24,721
Well, l don't think it's quite
that black and white. . .

297
00:25:26,932 --> 00:25:31,448
. . .but l think we both know
what men are like.

298
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,284
So on that basis. . .

299
00:25:35,491 --> 00:25:40,281
. . .l should conclude that you
wanted to fuck those two models.

300
00:25:42,132 --> 00:25:45,044
There are exceptions.

301
00:25:46,652 --> 00:25:50,361
And what makes you an exception?

302
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:56,527
What makes me an exception is that. . .

303
00:25:57,692 --> 00:26:00,047
. . .l happen to be in love with you.

304
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:02,605
And because we' re married. . .

305
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:06,930
. . .and because l would never
lie to you. . .

306
00:26:07,571 --> 00:26:09,085
. . .or hurt you.

307
00:26:16,731 --> 00:26:20,326
Do you realize that
what you' re saying. . .

308
00:26:20,571 --> 00:26:23,769
. . .is that the only reason you
wouldn't fuck those models. . .

309
00:26:23,971 --> 00:26:26,440
. . .is out of consideration for me?

310
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:29,564
Not because you really
wouldn't want to.

311
00:26:29,971 --> 00:26:32,566
Let's just relax, Alice.

312
00:26:32,771 --> 00:26:35,240
This pot is making you aggressive.

313
00:26:35,491 --> 00:26:38,722
No! lt's not the pot. lt's you!

314
00:26:38,971 --> 00:26:41,440
Why can't you ever give me
a straight fucking answer?

315
00:26:41,652 --> 00:26:44,119
l was under the impression
that's what l was doing.

316
00:26:44,332 --> 00:26:47,403
l don't even know
what we' re arguing about here.

317
00:26:47,612 --> 00:26:49,728
l' m not arguing.

318
00:26:50,412 --> 00:26:54,769
l' m just trying to find out
where you' re coming from.

319
00:26:55,132 --> 00:26:56,644
Where l' m coming from?

320
00:27:01,011 --> 00:27:05,449
Let's say, for example,
you have some gorgeous woman. . .

321
00:27:05,852 --> 00:27:09,605
. . .standing in your office naked. . .

322
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:12,372
. . .and you' re feeling her fucking tits.

323
00:27:12,571 --> 00:27:14,289
Now, what l want to know. . . .

324
00:27:14,491 --> 00:27:19,281
l want to know what you' re thinking
about when you' re squeezing them.

325
00:27:19,612 --> 00:27:23,445
Alice, l happen to be a doctor.

326
00:27:24,172 --> 00:27:26,127
lt's all very impersonal. . .

327
00:27:26,332 --> 00:27:29,768
. . .and you know
there's always a nurse present.

328
00:27:30,372 --> 00:27:34,968
So when you' re feeling tits, it's
nothing more than your professionalism?

329
00:27:35,172 --> 00:27:36,161
Exactly.

330
00:27:36,372 --> 00:27:40,729
Sex is the last thing on my mind
when l' m with a patient.

331
00:27:42,011 --> 00:27:45,971
Now, when she is having
her little titties squeezed. . .

332
00:27:46,172 --> 00:27:48,321
. . .do you think she ever
has fantasies. . .

333
00:27:48,531 --> 00:27:52,650
. . .about what handsome Dr. Bill's
dickie might be like?

334
00:27:54,652 --> 00:27:58,769
Come on, l can assure you
sex is the last thing. . .

335
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:03,050
. . .on this fucking hypothetical
woman patient's mind.

336
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:05,088
And what makes you so sure?

337
00:28:09,852 --> 00:28:11,843
lf for no better reason. . .

338
00:28:12,372 --> 00:28:15,204
. . .because she's afraid of
what l might find.

339
00:28:17,051 --> 00:28:20,646
So after you tell her that
everything's fine, what then?

340
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:23,009
What then?

341
00:28:24,372 --> 00:28:26,488
l don't know, Alice. . . .

342
00:28:27,971 --> 00:28:29,200
What then?

343
00:28:32,412 --> 00:28:34,800
Women don't. . . .

344
00:28:35,932 --> 00:28:39,321
They basically just don't
think like that.

345
00:28:41,531 --> 00:28:44,922
Millions of years of evolution, right?

346
00:28:46,731 --> 00:28:49,040
Men have to stick it
every place they can. . .

347
00:28:49,251 --> 00:28:52,324
. . .but for women, it is just about
security and commitment. . .

348
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,688
. . .and whatever the fuck else!

349
00:28:54,971 --> 00:28:58,487
A little oversimplified, Alice.
But yes, something like that.

350
00:28:59,011 --> 00:29:02,481
lf you men only knew.

351
00:29:03,771 --> 00:29:07,765
What l do know is you got stoned,
you tried to pick a fight. . .

352
00:29:07,971 --> 00:29:10,963
. . .and now you' re trying
to make me jealous.

353
00:29:11,172 --> 00:29:13,208
But you' re not the jealous type,
are you?

354
00:29:13,412 --> 00:29:14,527
No, l' m not.

355
00:29:14,731 --> 00:29:16,722
You've never been jealous about me,
have you?

356
00:29:16,971 --> 00:29:17,882
No, l haven't.

357
00:29:18,092 --> 00:29:20,480
And why haven't you ever
been jealous about me?

358
00:29:20,731 --> 00:29:24,486
Well, l don't know, Alice.
Maybe because you' re my wife.

359
00:29:24,692 --> 00:29:26,967
Maybe because you' re
the mother of my child. . .

360
00:29:27,172 --> 00:29:29,845
. . .and l know you would never
be unfaithful to me.

361
00:29:30,051 --> 00:29:34,170
You are very, very sure of yourself. . .

362
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:35,599
. . .aren't you?

363
00:29:36,132 --> 00:29:37,201
No.

364
00:29:38,011 --> 00:29:39,604
l' m sure of you.

365
00:29:51,412 --> 00:29:53,163
Do you think that's funny?

366
00:30:01,811 --> 00:30:03,450
All right. Fuck it.

367
00:30:04,172 --> 00:30:07,846
Now we get
the fucking laughing fit, right?

368
00:30:18,932 --> 00:30:20,250
Do you. . . .

369
00:30:22,332 --> 00:30:25,846
Do you remember
last summer at Cape Cod?

370
00:30:32,491 --> 00:30:35,450
Do you remember one night
in the dining room. . .

371
00:30:35,652 --> 00:30:37,721
. . .there was this young naval officer. . .

372
00:30:37,932 --> 00:30:42,323
. . .and he was sitting near our table
with two other officers?

373
00:30:43,771 --> 00:30:44,760
No.

374
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:51,325
The waiter brought him a message,
at which point he left.

375
00:30:51,531 --> 00:30:54,092
Nothing rings a bell?

376
00:31:00,531 --> 00:31:01,726
Well. . .

377
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:07,490
. . .l first saw him
that morning in the lobby.

378
00:31:08,251 --> 00:31:10,811
He was checking into the hotel. . .

379
00:31:11,051 --> 00:31:14,407
. . .and he was following the bellboy
with his luggage. . .

380
00:31:15,051 --> 00:31:16,962
. . .to the elevator.

381
00:31:21,332 --> 00:31:25,529
He glanced at me as he walked past.
Just a glance.

382
00:31:26,731 --> 00:31:28,403
Nothing more.

383
00:31:35,451 --> 00:31:38,443
But l could hardly. . .

384
00:31:40,051 --> 00:31:41,530
. . .move.

385
00:31:49,692 --> 00:31:52,286
That afternoon. . .

386
00:31:54,491 --> 00:31:58,371
. . .Helena went to the movies
with her friend. . .

387
00:32:01,731 --> 00:32:04,007
. . .and you and l made love.

388
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:11,281
And we made plans about our future. . .

389
00:32:12,412 --> 00:32:16,246
. . .and we talked about Helena.

390
00:32:17,932 --> 00:32:19,490
And yet. . .

391
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:23,165
. . .at no time. . .

392
00:32:24,412 --> 00:32:26,971
. . .was he ever. . .

393
00:32:28,092 --> 00:32:31,721
. . .out of my mind.

394
00:32:36,971 --> 00:32:41,682
And l thought if he wanted me. . .

395
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:45,845
. . .even if it was only. . .

396
00:32:47,372 --> 00:32:49,123
. . .for one night. . .

397
00:32:53,251 --> 00:32:56,800
. . .l was ready to give up everything.

398
00:32:58,492 --> 00:32:59,766
You.

399
00:33:02,331 --> 00:33:03,731
Helena.

400
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:09,800
My whole fucking future.

401
00:33:11,972 --> 00:33:13,530
Everything.

402
00:33:19,851 --> 00:33:24,003
And yet it was weird,
because at the same time. . .

403
00:33:25,132 --> 00:33:27,771
. . .you were dearer to me than ever.

404
00:33:32,092 --> 00:33:35,050
And at that moment, my love for you. . .

405
00:33:36,731 --> 00:33:38,768
. . .was both. . .

406
00:33:41,492 --> 00:33:45,963
. . .tender and sad.

407
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:59,005
l barely slept that night. . .

408
00:34:01,452 --> 00:34:04,967
. . .and l woke up the next morning
in a panic.

409
00:34:07,132 --> 00:34:10,806
l didn't know whether l was
afraid that he had left. . .

410
00:34:12,211 --> 00:34:15,487
. . .or that he might still be there.

411
00:34:19,612 --> 00:34:22,728
But by dinner. . .

412
00:34:25,211 --> 00:34:28,965
. . .l realized he was gone. . .

413
00:34:33,452 --> 00:34:37,239
. . .and l was. . .

414
00:34:38,132 --> 00:34:40,123
. . .relieved.

415
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:09,690
Yes, this is Dr. Harford.

416
00:35:15,931 --> 00:35:17,411
When did it happen?

417
00:35:24,012 --> 00:35:25,525
l have the address.

418
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:27,559
Thank you.

419
00:35:34,972 --> 00:35:37,088
Lou Nathanson just died.

420
00:35:45,251 --> 00:35:48,130
l think l have to go over there
and show my face.

421
00:36:39,811 --> 00:36:42,485
-Hello, Rosa.
-Good evening, Dr. Harford.

422
00:36:43,771 --> 00:36:47,447
-How is Miss Nathanson?
-Not so good. She's in the bedroom.

423
00:36:47,652 --> 00:36:48,721
Thank you.

424
00:37:03,452 --> 00:37:04,567
Come in.

425
00:37:10,492 --> 00:37:11,641
Marion. . . .

426
00:37:13,452 --> 00:37:15,248
Oh, Dr. Harford. . . .

427
00:37:16,012 --> 00:37:18,572
How good of you to come.

428
00:37:18,771 --> 00:37:21,126
l came as soon as l got the message.

429
00:37:21,331 --> 00:37:22,525
Thank you.

430
00:37:24,452 --> 00:37:26,568
-l' m so sorry.
-Thank you.

431
00:37:26,771 --> 00:37:28,489
Your father was. . . .

432
00:37:29,532 --> 00:37:32,284
He was a very brave man.

433
00:37:33,092 --> 00:37:34,490
Oh, thank you.

434
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:36,809
How are you holding up?

435
00:37:39,052 --> 00:37:40,643
l' m a bit numb.

436
00:37:41,052 --> 00:37:43,849
l don't think it's really sunk in yet.

437
00:37:45,172 --> 00:37:47,128
Would you like to sit down?

438
00:38:15,652 --> 00:38:17,802
lt's so unreal.

439
00:38:19,052 --> 00:38:21,007
Daddy had such a good day.

440
00:38:22,811 --> 00:38:27,327
His mind was clear,
and he remembered so many things.

441
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:32,327
Then he had a little dinner. . .

442
00:38:32,692 --> 00:38:35,809
. . .and he said he felt like
taking a nap.

443
00:38:37,092 --> 00:38:41,768
l went into the kitchen and talked
to Rosa for half an hour at most. . .

444
00:38:43,052 --> 00:38:46,043
. . .and when l went to see how he was. . .

445
00:38:46,251 --> 00:38:48,447
. . .l just thought he was asleep.

446
00:38:53,251 --> 00:38:57,130
Then l realized he wasn't breathing.

447
00:39:02,652 --> 00:39:04,210
From what you've said. . .

448
00:39:04,411 --> 00:39:08,291
. . .l' m sure your father died peacefully
in his sleep.

449
00:39:10,012 --> 00:39:12,128
Oh, God, l hope so.

450
00:39:14,211 --> 00:39:18,967
l think l've been more afraid of
the way it was going to happen. . .

451
00:39:19,612 --> 00:39:21,648
. . .than his death itself.

452
00:39:23,331 --> 00:39:26,005
Have you had a chance to phone
any of your relatives?

453
00:39:28,211 --> 00:39:32,364
l tried to call my stepmother in London,
but she was out.

454
00:39:32,931 --> 00:39:35,650
My boyfriend, Carl,
is making some calls. . .

455
00:39:35,851 --> 00:39:38,570
. . .and he'll be coming over soon.

456
00:39:42,972 --> 00:39:45,929
l think you've met Carl here
a few times.

457
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:50,130
Yes, l remember him.
He's a teacher, isn't he?

458
00:39:50,331 --> 00:39:52,288
A math professor.

459
00:39:55,132 --> 00:39:58,726
We' re going to get married in May.

460
00:40:00,572 --> 00:40:04,405
Well, that's wonderful news.
Congratulations.

461
00:40:08,092 --> 00:40:09,411
Thank you.

462
00:40:11,612 --> 00:40:15,400
Carl has a new teaching appointment
at the University of Michigan.

463
00:40:15,612 --> 00:40:17,681
We'll be moving out there soon.

464
00:40:18,411 --> 00:40:22,246
Michigan's a beautiful state.
l think you'll like it a lot.

465
00:40:28,652 --> 00:40:31,530
lt really could be a wonderful
change for you, Marion.

466
00:40:50,371 --> 00:40:52,407
Oh, my God, no. . . .

467
00:41:11,532 --> 00:41:13,204
l love you.

468
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,047
l love you.

469
00:41:17,251 --> 00:41:19,811
l love you, l love you, l love you.

470
00:41:20,052 --> 00:41:22,849
l don't want to go away with Carl.

471
00:41:23,132 --> 00:41:25,088
Marion, l don't think you realize--

472
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:26,519
l do.

473
00:41:26,811 --> 00:41:31,567
Even if l' m never to see you again,
l want at least to live near you.

474
00:41:32,371 --> 00:41:35,204
Marion, listen to me. Listen to me.

475
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:41,088
You' re very upset, and l don't think
you realize what you' re saying.

476
00:41:42,731 --> 00:41:44,130
l love you.

477
00:41:45,492 --> 00:41:48,244
We barely know each other.

478
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:52,726
We haven't had a single conversation
about anything except your father.

479
00:41:52,972 --> 00:41:54,563
l love you.

480
00:42:00,492 --> 00:42:02,244
That's probably Carl.

481
00:42:03,331 --> 00:42:05,561
Please don't despise me.

482
00:42:11,012 --> 00:42:13,047
-Hello, Rosa.
-Hello, Mr. Thomas.

483
00:42:14,692 --> 00:42:17,842
-ls she in the bedroom?
-Yes, she is.

484
00:42:18,052 --> 00:42:19,166
Thank you.

485
00:42:30,052 --> 00:42:31,041
Come in.

486
00:42:36,092 --> 00:42:37,320
Darling.

487
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:43,128
l' m so very sorry.

488
00:42:43,972 --> 00:42:45,485
Are you all right?

489
00:42:46,052 --> 00:42:47,485
l' m okay.

490
00:42:49,452 --> 00:42:52,682
-Dr. Harford, good evening.
-Good evening, Carl.

491
00:42:52,931 --> 00:42:55,650
Thank you very much
for coming over here tonight.

492
00:42:55,851 --> 00:42:58,684
-lt's the least l could do.
-lt means a lot to us.

493
00:42:58,972 --> 00:43:00,041
Thank you.

494
00:43:04,771 --> 00:43:07,445
l was actually on my way out.

495
00:43:10,172 --> 00:43:11,286
Marion. . .

496
00:43:12,692 --> 00:43:15,126
. . .your father was very proud of you. . .

497
00:43:15,331 --> 00:43:20,121
. . .and l know you gave him
great comfort these last months.

498
00:43:21,572 --> 00:43:22,686
Thank you.

499
00:43:29,012 --> 00:43:31,128
l'll show you out.

500
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:34,846
Good night.

501
00:44:20,811 --> 00:44:23,121
Listen to this.
She had a red rose in her mouth.

502
00:44:23,331 --> 00:44:25,721
She was doing a Mexican lap dance
right in my face.

503
00:44:25,972 --> 00:44:29,168
l' m serious!
l got scars on the back of my neck.

504
00:44:29,371 --> 00:44:31,168
What team's this switch hitter
playing for?

505
00:44:31,371 --> 00:44:33,681
-Looks like the pink team.
-Look at this faggot!

506
00:44:33,891 --> 00:44:35,563
Hey, watch it, you faggot!

507
00:44:35,771 --> 00:44:38,001
Merry Christmas, Mary!

508
00:44:38,211 --> 00:44:40,679
-Your butt-brothers are back there!
-Prime cut of meat!

509
00:44:40,931 --> 00:44:44,242
You want to take a ride in this
fudge-tunnel, you stupid faggot?

510
00:44:45,251 --> 00:44:48,085
You should have tits,
you' re standing so close!

511
00:44:48,291 --> 00:44:52,204
-l got dumps that are bigger than you!
-Come on, macho man!

512
00:44:52,411 --> 00:44:55,528
-You want a piece of this, baby?
-Exit only, honey.

513
00:44:55,851 --> 00:44:59,161
Go back to San Francisco
where you belong, man!

514
00:45:19,931 --> 00:45:23,527
Excuse me.
Do you know what time it is?

515
00:45:24,452 --> 00:45:26,043
Ten past 1 2.

516
00:45:28,251 --> 00:45:30,083
Going anywhere special?

517
00:45:30,492 --> 00:45:33,369
No, l' m just taking a walk.

518
00:45:38,012 --> 00:45:40,242
How'd you like to have a little fun?

519
00:45:41,532 --> 00:45:43,045
l' m sorry?

520
00:45:44,411 --> 00:45:46,083
Have a little fun?

521
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:49,688
l just live right down there.

522
00:45:50,371 --> 00:45:52,931
Would you like to come inside with me?

523
00:45:54,012 --> 00:45:56,128
Come inside with you?

524
00:45:58,652 --> 00:46:02,121
lt's a lot nicer in there
than it is out here.

525
00:46:09,211 --> 00:46:10,724
You live in there?

526
00:46:13,612 --> 00:46:15,010
By yourself?

527
00:46:15,291 --> 00:46:17,851
No. l have a roommate,
but she's not home.

528
00:46:19,371 --> 00:46:20,690
Hey, it's okay.

529
00:46:21,452 --> 00:46:23,407
Listen, no one will bother us.

530
00:46:24,411 --> 00:46:25,844
lt's okay. Come on.

531
00:46:26,572 --> 00:46:27,606
Come on.

532
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:54,001
This is it.

533
00:46:58,012 --> 00:46:59,445
That's a nice tree.

534
00:47:05,492 --> 00:47:09,086
Sorry about the mess.
Maid's day off.

535
00:47:23,331 --> 00:47:24,559

. . .cozy. lt's a. . .

537
00:47:28,452 --> 00:47:29,679
. . .cozy place.

538
00:47:30,811 --> 00:47:32,130
lt's okay.

539
00:47:47,291 --> 00:47:51,523
Do you suppose we
should talk about money?

540
00:47:52,251 --> 00:47:53,684
Yeah, l guess so.

541
00:47:55,291 --> 00:47:57,282
That depends on what you want to do.

542
00:48:01,692 --> 00:48:03,090
What do you want to do?

543
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:08,929
What do you recommend?

544
00:48:13,532 --> 00:48:15,170
What do l recommend?

545
00:48:29,211 --> 00:48:31,965
l'd rather not put it into words.

546
00:48:34,652 --> 00:48:36,722
How about you just leave it up to me?

547
00:48:37,211 --> 00:48:38,929
l' m in your hands.

548
00:48:41,692 --> 00:48:44,159
And how does 1 50 sound?

549
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,527
Sounds wonderful.

550
00:48:51,371 --> 00:48:55,159
Don't worry. l don't
keep track of the time.

551
00:49:02,692 --> 00:49:03,568
Thank you.

552
00:49:03,771 --> 00:49:04,726
Prego, prego.

553
00:49:04,972 --> 00:49:07,121
-Grazie.
-You're welcome.

554
00:49:08,052 --> 00:49:10,440
If I was Italian, he'd have
answered me in Italian.

555
00:49:52,931 --> 00:49:54,206
Shall we?

556
00:50:11,851 --> 00:50:13,126
Excuse me.

557
00:50:26,851 --> 00:50:28,570
ls everything all right?

558
00:50:32,251 --> 00:50:35,449
l was just wondering if you
were going to be much longer?

559
00:50:37,012 --> 00:50:41,688
Listen, it's a little difficult
to talk right now.

560
00:50:42,492 --> 00:50:44,289
lt could be awhile.

561
00:50:45,692 --> 00:50:47,762
Any idea how long?

562
00:50:48,572 --> 00:50:50,927
No, l don't really know.

563
00:50:51,291 --> 00:50:53,931
We' re still waiting
for some relatives to arrive.

564
00:50:55,931 --> 00:50:59,971
Well, l' m gonna go to bed now.

565
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:21,126
Was that Mrs. Dr. Bill?

566
00:51:40,572 --> 00:51:42,005
Do you have to go?

567
00:51:43,251 --> 00:51:45,288
Do l have to go?

568
00:51:49,771 --> 00:51:51,364
l think l do.

569
00:51:54,052 --> 00:51:55,405
Are you sure?

570
00:52:01,331 --> 00:52:03,447
Yes, l' m afraid so.

571
00:52:06,572 --> 00:52:09,369
But listen, l want to pay you anyway.

572
00:52:09,851 --> 00:52:14,050
How much did you say it was?
Hundred and fifty?

573
00:52:17,771 --> 00:52:21,208
But you know what? You don't
have to bother about that.

574
00:52:21,411 --> 00:52:22,811
No, it's all right.

575
00:52:23,692 --> 00:52:26,684
-No, really. You don't have to.
-No, l want to.

576
00:52:29,172 --> 00:52:30,081

581
00:53:46,291 --> 00:53:48,407

-Hey, Bill, you made it.

592
00:54:42,572 --> 00:54:45,961
l' m sorry, l got here just as you
were finishing your last set.

593
00:54:46,172 --> 00:54:49,083
That's all right.
The band sucked tonight anyway.

594
00:54:49,692 --> 00:54:52,728
-What are you drinking?
-A vodka and tonic, please.

595
00:54:54,251 --> 00:54:55,240

00:55:16,211 --> 00:55:17,530
You' re a long way from home.

Well, you gotta go where the work is.

609
00:55:34,771 --> 00:55:37,126
l got another gig later tonight.

610
00:55:37,331 --> 00:55:39,163
You' re playing somewhere else tonight?

611
00:55:39,371 --> 00:55:41,010
They only get started around 2.

612
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:42,920
ln the Village?

613
00:55:45,052 --> 00:55:48,327
Believe it or not, l don't actually
know the address yet.

614
00:55:48,731 --> 00:55:49,721
You don't?

615
00:55:50,371 --> 00:55:54,922
No. lt may sound ridiculous, but it's
in a different place every time. . .

616
00:55:55,132 --> 00:55:57,804
. . .and l only get it
an hour or so before.

617
00:55:58,012 --> 00:56:00,572
-A different place every time?
-So far.

618
00:56:01,652 --> 00:56:02,800
What's the big mystery?

619
00:56:03,572 --> 00:56:06,688
Hey, man, l just play the piano.

620
00:56:10,251 --> 00:56:13,369
Nick, l' m sorry.
ls there something l' m missing here?

621
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:19,010
l play blindfolded.

622
00:56:20,092 --> 00:56:21,206
What?

623
00:56:22,972 --> 00:56:25,440
l play blindfolded.

624
00:56:29,331 --> 00:56:30,811
You' re putting me on.

625
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:33,367
No, it's the truth.

626
00:56:34,331 --> 00:56:38,768
And the last time,
the blindfold wasn't on so well.

627
00:56:41,052 --> 00:56:42,690
Oh, man.

628
00:56:43,811 --> 00:56:47,963
Bill, l have seen one or two things
in my life. . .

629
00:56:48,331 --> 00:56:49,923
. . .but never. . .

630
00:56:50,291 --> 00:56:52,601
. . .never anything like this. . .

631
00:56:53,331 --> 00:56:56,244
. . .and never such women.

632
00:57:06,092 --> 00:57:07,286
Excuse me.

633
00:57:11,012 --> 00:57:13,923
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, this is Nick.

634
00:57:19,532 --> 00:57:21,284
l know where that is.

635
00:57:28,572 --> 00:57:29,481
Right.

636
00:57:32,972 --> 00:57:34,802
Well, l' m on my way right now.

637
00:57:35,532 --> 00:57:37,965
Okay, sir. Thank you.

638
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:41,519
What is this?

639
00:57:43,052 --> 00:57:45,565
lt's the name of a Beethoven opera,
isn't it?

640
00:57:50,172 --> 00:57:51,764
lt's the password.

641
00:57:52,492 --> 00:57:53,925
The password?

642
00:57:55,132 --> 00:57:58,646
Yeah. Look, l' m really sorry
to do this to you, Bill.

643
00:57:59,612 --> 00:58:03,320
l gotta get going. l gotta go.

644
00:58:08,172 --> 00:58:11,960
You know there is no way on earth. . .

645
00:58:12,411 --> 00:58:15,768
. . .that you are going to leave here
without taking me with you.

646
00:58:16,411 --> 00:58:19,927
-Come on, buddy, give me a break.
-Nick, l'll tell you what.

647
00:58:20,132 --> 00:58:23,248
l've already got the password.

648
00:58:24,132 --> 00:58:27,168
Just give me the address.
l'll go there by myself. . .

649
00:58:27,371 --> 00:58:30,807
. . .and there won't be any connection
between us whatsoever.

650
00:58:33,411 --> 00:58:37,405
Listen, let's just say
for one second. . .

651
00:58:38,331 --> 00:58:40,447
. . .that l was prepared to do that.

652
00:58:40,771 --> 00:58:43,969
You couldn't get in anyway
in those clothes.

653
00:58:45,092 --> 00:58:46,365
Why not?

654
00:58:46,811 --> 00:58:50,929
Because everyone is always
costumed and masked.

655
00:58:51,731 --> 00:58:55,246
Where the hell are you gonna
get a costume at this hour?

656
00:59:14,371 --> 00:59:16,442
Thanks. Keep the change.

657
00:59:29,052 --> 00:59:31,246
Yes? Who is it?

658
00:59:31,452 --> 00:59:33,123

00:59:38,652 --> 00:59:40,483

Okay.

668
01:00:03,172 --> 01:00:04,570
Just a moment.

He moved to Chicago over a year ago.

672
01:00:27,811 --> 01:00:29,927
He moved to Chicago?

673
01:00:32,492 --> 01:00:34,447
l wasn't aware of that.

674
01:00:36,331 --> 01:00:39,768
Then are you the present owner
of Rainbow Fashions?

675
01:00:39,972 --> 01:00:41,530
Yes, l am.

676
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:42,847

01:00:57,291 --> 01:01:00,125
Okay, so you are Dr. Harford.

682
01:01:00,331 --> 01:01:03,608
lf l see Peter, l tell him
you were looking for him.

683
01:01:03,811 --> 01:01:05,847
Oh, no, wait. Please, please. . . .

684
01:01:06,452 --> 01:01:09,807
Listen, the reason that
l came here tonight was. . . .

685
01:01:11,771 --> 01:01:16,481
Basically, the reason is
that l need a costume.

01:01:16,931 --> 01:01:20,561
And l'd be happy to pay you
$ 1 00 over the rental price. . .

. . .for the inconvenience.

01:01:24,132 --> 01:01:25,360
A hundred dollars?

689
01:01:28,731 --> 01:01:30,324
l don't think so.

690
01:01:33,652 --> 01:01:35,449
How about $200?

691
01:01:36,052 --> 01:01:38,485
Two hundred dollars
over the rental price?

692
01:01:49,851 --> 01:01:51,045
Come in.

693
01:01:55,331 --> 01:01:57,846

697
01:02:15,612 --> 01:02:18,523
A cloak with a hood and a mask?

698
01:02:22,211 --> 01:02:24,679
l think we'll find something for you.

699
01:02:25,411 --> 01:02:27,003
Follow me, please.

700
01:02:27,532 --> 01:02:28,487
Good.

701
01:02:37,092 --> 01:02:39,161
Looks like alive, huh?

702
01:02:40,851 --> 01:02:42,762
-lt's wonderful.
-Come.

703
01:02:43,771 --> 01:02:45,967
So what color cloak?

704
01:02:47,371 --> 01:02:49,010
Red, brown, red?

705
01:02:50,331 --> 01:02:51,367
Black.

706
01:02:51,572 --> 01:02:54,961
The good doctor wouldn't
like something more colorful?

707
01:02:55,172 --> 01:02:57,686
-l don't think so.
-Clowns, officers, pirates?

708
01:02:57,931 --> 01:03:00,445
No, just the tux, the black cloak--

709
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:02,802
With a hood and a mask.

710
01:03:05,172 --> 01:03:06,605
May l take your coat?

711
01:03:08,411 --> 01:03:11,563
-You are medicine doctor, yes?
-Yes, l am.

712
01:03:12,492 --> 01:03:16,166
-l have some problem with my hair.
-Your hair?

713
01:03:16,371 --> 01:03:18,327
lt's starting to fall down too fast.

714
01:03:18,532 --> 01:03:21,329
l lost, in two weeks, a lot of hair.
Mostly here.

715
01:03:21,532 --> 01:03:23,443
Look at this. Here.

716
01:03:24,731 --> 01:03:25,800
You see?

717
01:03:26,492 --> 01:03:27,606
And?

718
01:03:28,452 --> 01:03:30,601
l' m afraid this really isn't my field.

719
01:03:30,811 --> 01:03:32,722
What? You can't help me?

720
01:03:32,931 --> 01:03:36,367
No. You should see a trichologist.
lt's a hair specialist.

721
01:03:36,572 --> 01:03:40,041
Mr. Milich, l've obviously
left things a bit late tonight.

722
01:03:40,251 --> 01:03:41,889
So if you don't mind--

723
01:03:42,092 --> 01:03:44,083
l' m in hurry too, to get back to bed.

724
01:03:44,291 --> 01:03:45,519
l understand.

725
01:03:46,492 --> 01:03:48,005
So black cloak?

726
01:03:52,731 --> 01:03:54,085
Did you hear something?

727
01:03:57,251 --> 01:03:58,764
What is this?

728
01:04:08,092 --> 01:04:09,809
What is it?

729
01:04:14,692 --> 01:04:16,568
What is this?

730
01:04:29,731 --> 01:04:32,291
What on earth is going on here?!

731
01:04:32,492 --> 01:04:34,527
Milich, l can explain everything.

732
01:04:34,731 --> 01:04:36,927
You! What are you doing here?

733
01:04:37,132 --> 01:04:38,849
l promise l'll kill you!

734
01:04:39,092 --> 01:04:42,800
And you!
Have you no sense of decency?

735
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:46,641
Gentlemen, have you
no sense of decency?!

736
01:04:46,851 --> 01:04:50,322
Milich, are you crazy? We were
invited here by the young lady.

737
01:04:50,532 --> 01:04:54,730
Young lady? This is my daughter!
Couldn't you see she's a child?

738
01:04:54,972 --> 01:04:57,610
-You will have to explain to police!
-To the police?!

739
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:00,530
You little whore!
l kill you for this.

740
01:05:00,731 --> 01:05:04,168
l promise, l'll kill you!
l'll kill you!

741
01:05:04,371 --> 01:05:06,442
Hold on to that girl for me, please!

742
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:10,440
Milich, this is preposterous.
The young lady invited us here.

743
01:05:10,652 --> 01:05:12,643
Couldn't you see she is deranged?!

744
01:05:12,851 --> 01:05:14,443
Doctor, l' m sorry to keep you waiting.

745
01:05:14,652 --> 01:05:17,324
Gentlemen, this is now a police matter.

746
01:05:17,532 --> 01:05:20,045
You will please stay here
until l return.

747
01:05:20,251 --> 01:05:21,809
Let us out of here!

748
01:05:22,052 --> 01:05:23,849
That's out of the question.

749
01:05:24,092 --> 01:05:27,527
Doctor, sorry.
What color did you say?

750
01:05:27,731 --> 01:05:29,289
-Black?
-Black.

751
01:05:29,851 --> 01:05:33,322
Gentlemen, please have the goodness
to be quiet for the moment!

752
01:05:33,532 --> 01:05:35,681
Couldn't you see
l try to serve my customer?

753
01:05:35,931 --> 01:05:36,807
Sorry.

754
01:05:37,371 --> 01:05:40,762
And you, little whore, go to bed
at once, you depraved creature.

755
01:05:40,972 --> 01:05:43,327
l'll deal with you
after l serve this gentleman.

756
01:05:44,052 --> 01:05:46,690
You should have a cloak
lined with ermine.

757
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:31,247
Okay, that's $74.50.

758
01:07:31,971 --> 01:07:35,600
Seventy-four fifty. All right.

759
01:07:36,731 --> 01:07:38,211
There's 80.

760
01:07:38,652 --> 01:07:41,404
l promised you 50 bucks
over the meter, right?

761
01:07:43,612 --> 01:07:46,887
l'll make that a hundred,
if you wait for me.

762
01:07:47,091 --> 01:07:48,570
Just let the meter run.

763
01:07:48,771 --> 01:07:52,002
l'll give you the other half
plus the meter when l get back.

764
01:07:52,212 --> 01:07:54,725
-Okay?
-How long you gonna be?

765
01:07:54,971 --> 01:07:58,168
l don't know, maybe an hour or more.
But maybe only 1 0 minutes.

766
01:07:59,372 --> 01:08:01,203
l'll leave my stuff here in the back.

767
01:08:18,372 --> 01:08:19,690
Good evening, sir.

768
01:08:20,572 --> 01:08:21,845
Good evening.

769
01:08:22,452 --> 01:08:23,770
Can we be of any help?

770
01:08:25,452 --> 01:08:27,283
l suppose you'd like the password.

771
01:08:27,492 --> 01:08:29,050
lf you'd like, sir.

772
01:08:29,412 --> 01:08:30,207
Fidelio.

773
01:08:30,412 --> 01:08:33,369
Thank you, sir.
We'll run you up to the house.

774
01:09:11,811 --> 01:09:13,404
Good evening, sir.

775
01:09:13,612 --> 01:09:14,930
Good evening.

776
01:09:15,292 --> 01:09:16,725
Password, sir?

777
01:09:17,532 --> 01:09:18,487
Fidelio.

778
01:09:19,051 --> 01:09:20,451
Thank you, sir.
