1
00:00:20,337 --> 00:00:23,083
<i>The Red Sox are
taking on the Yankees at Fenway Park.</i>

2
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:24,242
Five stars.

3
00:01:01,212 --> 00:01:02,445
Hmm.

4
00:01:42,887 --> 00:01:44,188
Oh.

5
00:01:44,322 --> 00:01:45,655
<i>Boston police.</i>

6
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,326
Hi, this is I. M. Fletcher
calling from 5 Union Park.

7
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:51,661
- <i>Yeah, and?</i>
- There's a murdered woman downstairs.

8
00:01:51,796 --> 00:01:53,764
<i>- There's a what woman?</i>
- Murdered.

9
00:01:53,898 --> 00:01:56,733
<i>Well, uh, this is
just a general precinct line.</i>

10
00:01:56,868 --> 00:01:58,745
<i>If you're scheduling a meeting
or something like that.</i>

11
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:00,369
Yeah, well,
this is just a courtesy call.

12
00:02:00,403 --> 00:02:03,341
<i>A courtesy call?
You got a murder, you call 911.</i>

13
00:02:03,473 --> 00:02:07,778
Well... the emergency
part's kind of over, you know?

14
00:02:07,912 --> 00:02:10,314
<i>Well, this isn't
the murder department.</i>

15
00:02:11,182 --> 00:02:14,417
Can you just tell homicide?
It's 5 Union Park.

16
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,787
They like murders.
They'll be interested.

17
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:28,099
Uh, whoops.

18
00:02:31,202 --> 00:02:32,870
- You Fletcher?
- Yes.

19
00:02:33,004 --> 00:02:34,872
I'm Sergeant Inspector Monroe.

20
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:37,407
Inspector?
Like in Scotland Yard?

21
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,676
- This is Griz.
- Hello, Mr. Fletcher.

22
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,611
Please,
my mother calls me Mr. Fletcher.

23
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:44,026
- You can call me Fletch.
- Did you have a piece of fruit?

24
00:02:44,782 --> 00:02:46,317
I had a pear. How did you know?

25
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:48,518
There's obviously
a piece missing.

26
00:02:48,652 --> 00:02:50,388
Griz, check the front door.

27
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,721
Okay.

28
00:02:51,856 --> 00:02:54,424
- What's your full name?
- I. M. Fletcher.

29
00:02:54,557 --> 00:02:56,693
Hmm. I am Monroe.

30
00:02:57,527 --> 00:02:58,996
Full name, please.

31
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,500
Irwin Maurice Fletcher.

32
00:03:11,641 --> 00:03:13,161
They caught me
in the middle of a yawn.

33
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,290
They wouldn't let me retake it.
Can you imagine that?

34
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,315
What'd you hit her with?

35
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,950
I didn't hit her with anything.

36
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,184
This your place?

37
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:22,053
Well, I'm renting it
for a couple of weeks.

38
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:24,521
It's owned by a guy named Owen Tasserly.

39
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:26,991
Rather opulent
for just one person.

40
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:30,795
Well, before you get the idea
that I'm some rich asshole, I'm not.

41
00:03:30,928 --> 00:03:33,596
My girlfriend has the money.
She arranged this.

42
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,433
Where is she?
Rome.

43
00:03:35,565 --> 00:03:37,268
Where I just flew back in from.

44
00:03:37,401 --> 00:03:38,803
Um,
I checked the front entrance.

45
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:40,972
There's a key deadlock
and there's a sliding bolt

46
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:43,540
and no footprints
and no forced entry.

47
00:03:43,673 --> 00:03:45,542
Nice job, Griz. Take five.

48
00:03:45,675 --> 00:03:47,011
What's your girlfriend's name?

49
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,779
Andy. Angela.

50
00:03:48,913 --> 00:03:51,849
Andy Angela.
Write that down, Griz.

51
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:54,452
It's Angela de Grassi.
You kill her too?

52
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:56,954
May I remind you
that I reported this murder

53
00:03:57,088 --> 00:03:58,856
and waited
for you all to arrive?

54
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,424
You been drinking long?
Oh, geez,

55
00:04:00,557 --> 00:04:02,559
I had my first beer
when I was 12.

56
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,829
Mmm.

57
00:04:05,695 --> 00:04:07,198
Here you go, Griz.

58
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,100
I'm not your waitress.

59
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:11,878
No, I understand that, but I thought
maybe you'd like my fingerprints.

60
00:04:11,902 --> 00:04:14,504
- See? Cooperating.
- Mmm.

61
00:04:14,637 --> 00:04:17,408
Hey, um, guy... Sorry, I
don't know your name. Evidence?

62
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,112
Do you need a blanket?

63
00:04:21,245 --> 00:04:22,545
You know what, Griz?

64
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,424
Why don't you ask
Mr. Fletcher some questions.

65
00:04:24,448 --> 00:04:27,118
You're gonna have
the trainee interrogate me?

66
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:28,853
Go ahead, Griz.

67
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:30,788
Go ahead, Griz.

68
00:04:31,255 --> 00:04:33,523
Okay. Um...

69
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:39,497
Um...
...Mr. Fletcher,

70
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:41,999
did you know the victim,
Laurel Goodwin?

71
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:44,802
Mm-mmm. We never
offer up the victim's name.

72
00:04:44,935 --> 00:04:47,138
It's Griz's turn.

73
00:04:47,271 --> 00:04:49,672
Never met her. At least
not while she was alive.

74
00:04:49,807 --> 00:04:51,487
- What flight were you on?
- Alitalia.

75
00:04:51,574 --> 00:04:53,543
I landed at 8:46 p.m.

76
00:04:53,676 --> 00:04:55,545
But you didn't call
the police until 11:09.

77
00:04:55,678 --> 00:04:58,783
Well, I stopped and had dinner at
the Warren Tavern on the way in.

78
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,485
Can you produce proof of that?
A receipt, perhaps?

79
00:05:01,618 --> 00:05:03,320
I paid cash.

80
00:05:03,454 --> 00:05:05,432
- What do you do for a living?
- I'm a freelance journalist.

81
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:08,025
I've spent the last two years
traveling Europe writing about art.

82
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:10,494
Quite the art collection
Mr. Tasserly has.

83
00:05:10,627 --> 00:05:11,661
Yeah.

84
00:05:11,796 --> 00:05:13,497
Paul Klee out there.
A Degas horse.

85
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,466
I saw a Warhol over there
by the fish tank.

86
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:16,834
See, this is my theory.

87
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:20,071
I think the victim
interrupted an art theft.

88
00:05:20,204 --> 00:05:23,307
The thief got spooked, bonked
her over the head and then ran.

89
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:24,975
No amateur sleuthing, please.

90
00:05:25,109 --> 00:05:28,678
Listen, I used to be a investigative
reporter of some repute.

91
00:05:28,813 --> 00:05:30,573
I could be very helpful
in this whole matter.

92
00:05:30,647 --> 00:05:32,092
I used to play the trumpet
in high school.

93
00:05:32,116 --> 00:05:34,385
I never offered advice
to Miles Davis.

94
00:05:34,518 --> 00:05:35,920
Shut up and talk.

95
00:05:36,053 --> 00:05:37,955
That's a very confusing
combination of commands.

96
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:40,191
Mr. Fletcher,
why are you in Boston?

97
00:05:40,324 --> 00:05:44,395
I'm researching a book. The definitive
biography of Edgar Arthur Tharp Jr.

98
00:05:44,528 --> 00:05:46,097
The cowboy painter.

99
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,532
- You've heard of him.
- I prefer Remington.

100
00:05:48,665 --> 00:05:50,434
You would.

101
00:05:50,568 --> 00:05:52,536
Go on, Griz.
Okay. Where was I?

102
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:57,108
Sorry, I'm so distracted by
Mr. Fletcher's feet.

103
00:05:57,241 --> 00:05:59,376
Come on, Griz.
Feet want to be free.

104
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,678
I see you two have been
brainwashed by the shoe lobby.

105
00:06:01,812 --> 00:06:04,048
My Go...
Okay, look, Mr. Fletcher.

106
00:06:04,181 --> 00:06:07,885
If you did kill this young woman, a
confession would be appreciated.

107
00:06:08,018 --> 00:06:10,921
I have a baby at the house. Do
you have a baby at your house?

108
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:12,923
I really could use some sleep.

109
00:06:13,057 --> 00:06:16,393
Okay, Inspector, you know there's
such a thing as paternity leave, right?

110
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:20,564
So, you're a journalist,
traipsing all over Europe?

111
00:06:20,697 --> 00:06:23,337
- You really make a living doing that?
- Yeah, I make a decent one.

112
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:29,507
No secondary forms of income
from more unsavory lines of work?

113
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,610
Writing for in-flight magazines
is about as unsavory as it gets.

114
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:36,679
You got some place you can stay? We're
gonna need 24 hours to do a full sweep.

115
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:38,549
I don't know. Right here's okay.

116
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:43,087
Are you sure there's nothing
you're hiding from me, Mr. Fletcher?

117
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:48,092
Come on, Inspector.
I'm an open book.

118
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:27,591
Mr. Fletcher?
Yes.

119
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,628
Thank you for meeting me,
Miss de Grassi.

120
00:08:31,462 --> 00:08:33,197
Would you like something, sir?

121
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,665
Uh, are you paying?

122
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:36,767
A negroni, please.

123
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,370
- Madame, another one?
- No, thank you.

124
00:08:39,503 --> 00:08:42,273
So, how is the Count
Clementi Arbogastes de Grassi?

125
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,675
My father is fine.

126
00:08:44,808 --> 00:08:48,979
But I don't understand why he
hired you to find his stolen paintings.

127
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:51,215
Who are you?
I'm a freelance journalist.

128
00:08:51,348 --> 00:08:53,272
Uh, your father liked
a piece I wrote about

129
00:08:53,296 --> 00:08:55,219
an art theft at the Royal
Museum in Brussels.

130
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:57,421
My story helped the police
crack the case.

131
00:08:57,554 --> 00:08:59,556
Good for you,
but you're not a detective.

132
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,359
No, but I was an investigative
reporter of some repute.

133
00:09:02,493 --> 00:09:04,662
I don't do much of
that anymore. Why?

134
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:09,600
It's an occupation that's been cheapened
by the digital age, like president.

135
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:13,170
Well, I wasn't at my father's villa
when the paintings were stolen,

136
00:09:13,304 --> 00:09:15,706
so I don't have
any new information.

137
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,274
Well, that's okay. I do.

138
00:09:19,043 --> 00:09:22,079
You do? Tell me.

139
00:09:22,212 --> 00:09:24,515
There's an art dealer
in Boston named Ronald Ho ran.

140
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,926
He's already sold two of your
father's Renaissance paintings.

141
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,473
The Bellini and the Perugino.

142
00:09:28,497 --> 00:09:30,921
Are you serious? H-How
would he have them?

143
00:09:31,055 --> 00:09:32,423
Well, I have no idea.

144
00:09:32,556 --> 00:09:34,358
He might not even know
that they were stolen.

145
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,061
Do you think he has the other
paintings? All nine were taken.

146
00:09:37,194 --> 00:09:38,462
He very well might.

147
00:09:38,595 --> 00:09:41,665
The Picasso was appraised
at 20 million dollars.

148
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,902
Well, that hardly seems
worth stealing. <i>Grazia.</i>

149
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:47,280
Excuse me, I
changed my mind. I'll have another.

150
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,209
So,
what are you going to do now?

151
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:54,345
Well, I'd thought I'd visit
Mr. Ho ran in Boston

152
00:09:54,478 --> 00:09:57,318
and see if he had any ties to Rome
or the black market in the art world.

153
00:09:57,381 --> 00:09:59,983
How can I help,
Mr. Fletcher?

154
00:10:00,117 --> 00:10:02,186
You don't need to be so formal.

155
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,388
What should I call you?

156
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,858
All of my friends call me...

157
00:10:07,991 --> 00:10:09,493
Fletch!

158
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:24,975
I want to swim in your eyes.

159
00:10:25,676 --> 00:10:27,878
Like a...

160
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:31,115
...piss.

161
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,418
Like a piss?

162
00:10:35,352 --> 00:10:37,955
No, like a <i>pisciata,</i>
like a pool.

163
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:43,193
My Italian is very good.

164
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:48,899
No. No. No.-

165
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,840
So what do
you know about this Ronald Ho ran?

166
00:10:55,973 --> 00:11:00,210
On his Facebook page, I found out
he teaches an art history class at Harvard.

167
00:11:00,344 --> 00:11:02,079
He's a member
of the Mayflower Yacht Club

168
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:06,417
and he's really into EDM,
electronic dance music.

169
00:11:07,284 --> 00:11:09,186
Had his gallery broken into
in 2015.

170
00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:12,589
They stole some
Impressionist paintings, um...

171
00:11:12,723 --> 00:11:14,558
I really haven't found
anything incriminating.

172
00:11:14,691 --> 00:11:18,028
Sometimes I wonder
i-if my father's new wife,

173
00:11:18,162 --> 00:11:20,364
the Countess de Grassi,
as she loves to call herself,

174
00:11:20,497 --> 00:11:23,400
if somehow she's involved.

175
00:11:23,534 --> 00:11:27,938
I don't trust her, Fletch, and I know
she married papa for his money.

176
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:30,340
Well, Andy,
that's pretty cynical.

177
00:11:31,341 --> 00:11:33,377
Well, maybe she married him
for love...

178
00:11:33,878 --> 00:11:35,212
of money.

179
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,585
<i>How did you end up in Europe?</i>

180
00:11:41,718 --> 00:11:43,220
<i>Was it because of a woman?</i>

181
00:11:43,353 --> 00:11:46,990
Two actually. My
ex-wives said they needed space,

182
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,259
so I figured
6,000 miles is about right.

183
00:11:49,393 --> 00:11:53,464
Wow, how is it
that you were married twice?

184
00:11:54,198 --> 00:11:56,901
I am very easy
to fall in love with.

185
00:11:57,034 --> 00:12:01,472
I'm very good at falling
in love. Not so good at choosing.

186
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:05,509
How so? Well, I've fallen
in love with married men,

187
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:09,413
pathological liars,
two drug dealers

188
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,182
and a pyromaniac.

189
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:15,152
Well, now, see, I'm only
one or two of those things.

190
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:21,558
Your famine
creates traffic jams.

191
00:12:21,692 --> 00:12:23,494
Please, no more Italian.

192
00:12:24,561 --> 00:12:26,865
- Ignore it.
- Mm-hmm.

193
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:32,668
Okay.

194
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:41,645
We need to speak
to Madam Angela de Grassi.

195
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:43,323
Has something
happened to my father?

196
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:44,916
I'm afraid so.

197
00:12:45,048 --> 00:12:46,416
He has been kidnapped.

198
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,319
All we know is that
it was three men with guns.

199
00:12:49,453 --> 00:12:52,589
They put your father into a car
and drove off.

200
00:12:52,723 --> 00:12:54,926
They put the priest
in the machine?

201
00:12:55,058 --> 00:12:57,327
Did they hurt him?
We don't think so.

202
00:12:57,461 --> 00:13:00,097
You don't
have to speak in English.

203
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,266
My Italian is very good.

204
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:05,168
We've kept it quiet so far.

205
00:13:05,302 --> 00:13:06,737
Was the Countess de Grassi
there?

206
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:09,540
No, she's visiting her brother
in Milan.

207
00:13:09,673 --> 00:13:11,353
The kidnappers have already
named a ransom.

208
00:13:11,408 --> 00:13:12,977
I'll pay them
whatever they want.

209
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,979
They don't want money.

210
00:13:15,112 --> 00:13:17,748
They want a painting
your father owns.

211
00:13:19,683 --> 00:13:20,752
A Picasso.

212
00:13:22,787 --> 00:13:24,354
That's very Italian.

213
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,661
<i>Fletch, I can't sleep.</i>

214
00:13:30,795 --> 00:13:33,163
<i>- I miss you.</i>
- I miss you too. I wish you were here.

215
00:13:33,297 --> 00:13:34,799
Do I hear people talking?

216
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:37,214
<i>Uh, listen, Andy,
I need you to contact that site</i>

217
00:13:37,267 --> 00:13:39,403
<i>where you found
Tasserly's townhouse.</i>

218
00:13:39,536 --> 00:13:41,471
Is there something
wrong with it? Well, kinda.

219
00:13:41,605 --> 00:13:45,342
Uh,
I found a dead woman downstairs.

220
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:48,612
What? <i>Oddio santo!</i>

221
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,615
Who-Who-Who was she?
Who killed her?

222
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,818
Apparently,
her name is Laurel Goodwin.

223
00:13:53,952 --> 00:13:56,687
I have no idea who killed her,
but there is a detective here

224
00:13:56,821 --> 00:13:59,891
who seems very keen on the idea
of it being me.

225
00:14:00,024 --> 00:14:01,224
How could he think that?

226
00:14:01,358 --> 00:14:02,518
<i>I'm looking into it.</i>

227
00:14:02,626 --> 00:14:04,762
Please don't get involved, okay?

228
00:14:04,896 --> 00:14:07,999
<i>We have to focus on
finding out if Ho ran has the Picasso.</i>

229
00:14:08,131 --> 00:14:09,371
<i>Okay?
We have to save my father.</i>

230
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:10,701
No, we will. We will.

231
00:14:10,835 --> 00:14:12,715
Did you get the line of credit
set up at Lloyds?

232
00:14:12,837 --> 00:14:14,438
<i>Of course I did.</i>

233
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:16,549
Fletch, the
Countess is going around Rome

234
00:14:16,573 --> 00:14:18,308
telling anyone who will listen

235
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:21,846
that my father's left her
everything, as if he's already dead.

236
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,781
<i>Andy,
why don't you just come here?</i>

237
00:14:23,915 --> 00:14:27,919
That way, we can be together
while I sort out this Ho ran situation

238
00:14:28,052 --> 00:14:29,787
and all this other stuff.

239
00:14:29,921 --> 00:14:33,825
I want to be with you, Fletch,
but not with my father still missing.

240
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,293
<i>And now this horrible thing
has happened to you.</i>

241
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:40,130
Yeah, I think the horrible thing
happened to Laurel Goodwin.

242
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,105
Yeah, is this Julio?

243
00:14:47,237 --> 00:14:51,742
Hi, it's Mr. Fletcher. I was calling about
the used van you had listed on Only Vans.

244
00:14:51,876 --> 00:14:54,144
- Morris.
- Oh, that's great, yeah.

245
00:14:54,277 --> 00:14:57,648
I will... I'll see you this
afternoon. Excellent. Thanks.

246
00:15:04,022 --> 00:15:05,255
You sleep.

247
00:15:21,738 --> 00:15:23,306
You know what?
Right here's fine.

248
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,509
What? I can't stop here.

249
00:15:25,642 --> 00:15:28,122
Understood. Maybe you have
something up there I can vomit into?

250
00:15:34,418 --> 00:15:35,887
- Five stars.
- Bye.

251
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:50,300
Oh, my...

252
00:15:52,302 --> 00:15:53,637
Where the fuck are we?

253
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:55,439
Um...

254
00:15:57,175 --> 00:15:58,408
Five stars.

255
00:16:07,684 --> 00:16:09,586
<i>Hello?</i>
Ralph Locke for Mr...

256
00:16:18,796 --> 00:16:21,431
In here.

257
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:25,535
Mr. Ho ran.

258
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:28,338
Well, wonderful
to finally meet you, Mr. Locke.

259
00:16:28,472 --> 00:16:29,639
Please, call me Ralph.

260
00:16:29,774 --> 00:16:31,876
Ah, I'm sorry,
I don't shake hands.

261
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:33,243
Uh, since the pandemic?

262
00:16:33,376 --> 00:16:34,678
Since touch screens.

263
00:16:34,812 --> 00:16:37,514
Haven't had a cold in 20 years.
Please.

264
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:38,916
There you have it.
Mm-hmm.

265
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,761
Some interesting music
you were listening to.

266
00:16:40,785 --> 00:16:44,155
Yes, it gets the blood pumping
and the pulse pounding.

267
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,456
I guess that's why
it sounds like a heart monitor.

268
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,426
I apologize, Ralph,
I'm a little pressed for time.

269
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:51,195
I teach a summer
school class at Harvard.

270
00:16:51,328 --> 00:16:52,864
Oh, please, no worries.

271
00:16:58,169 --> 00:17:01,139
<i>Portrait of a Woman
With an Ermine Collar.</i>

272
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:04,142
In this case,
Picasso's wife, Olga.

273
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:06,210
He made several portraits
of Olga,

274
00:17:06,343 --> 00:17:10,915
but when you emailed me about this
one, I didn't really believe it existed.

275
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:14,518
But it does.
And I found the owner.

276
00:17:14,651 --> 00:17:15,887
Is he willing to sell?

277
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,189
Uh, he's willing
to entertain an offer.

278
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:21,225
What's his name? Oh, he
prefers to remain anonymous,

279
00:17:21,358 --> 00:17:23,060
but he lives in New York City

280
00:17:23,194 --> 00:17:26,363
and I think I can get the Picasso
here by Saturday, maybe even Friday.

281
00:17:26,496 --> 00:17:27,765
Well, that is terrific.

282
00:17:27,899 --> 00:17:31,202
There is also the question
of credit, Mr. Locke.

283
00:17:31,334 --> 00:17:33,537
Most of the people I deal with
I've known for years.

284
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:37,741
Lloyds Bank of Canary Islands should be able
to establish whatever credit you require.

285
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,945
It's like I've known you
for years.

286
00:17:41,078 --> 00:17:45,582
Here is a simple boilerplate
contract for my services.

287
00:17:45,715 --> 00:17:47,819
- 'Kay.
- Oh, please.

288
00:17:55,893 --> 00:17:56,824
Okay.

289
00:17:56,848 --> 00:17:59,663
That one goes here.

290
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:03,400
Of course.

291
00:18:05,069 --> 00:18:07,047
Quite the collection of
impressionists you have here.

292
00:18:07,071 --> 00:18:12,043
Mmm. Pre-, post-, neo-.
All the best prefixes.

293
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:15,336
I was robbed a few years ago, so I don't
keep anything of value in the building.

294
00:18:15,378 --> 00:18:17,915
Those are reproductions.
That's how I introduce my children.

295
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:21,018
Oh, do you sail?
I do not.

296
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:23,392
I have an aversion to boat
shoes. Well, shoes in general,

297
00:18:23,453 --> 00:18:26,423
but boat shoes in particular. I
mean, is it a slipper or is it a shoe?

298
00:18:26,556 --> 00:18:28,491
Come on. Pick a lane.

299
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,795
Is this a model of your boat?

300
00:18:30,928 --> 00:18:33,197
Well, yes,
I'm embarrassed to admit it is.

301
00:18:33,865 --> 00:18:35,933
Well, she's beautiful.
Thank you.

302
00:18:36,067 --> 00:18:38,435
I hope to see you
soon, Mr. Ho ran. Indeed.

303
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:49,646
Always fondling my boat.

304
00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:54,618
All right. Well, here we go.

305
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:58,089
$1200.
All right, cool.

306
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:01,458
Just be mindful of the bees
in the back. You feel me?

307
00:19:02,293 --> 00:19:03,928
That honey's all yours, baby.

308
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,469
Hi, Andy. Still miss me?

309
00:19:12,602 --> 00:19:16,640
Yes, my love, so much.
But you know what I found out?

310
00:19:16,774 --> 00:19:19,277
The Countess's brother,
he's been to prison.

311
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:22,013
<i>He's a thief. I bet you he
stole all the paintings for her.</i>

312
00:19:22,146 --> 00:19:24,791
You know, Andy, I know
you don't like the Countess very much,

313
00:19:24,815 --> 00:19:26,449
but she was very charming
when I met her.

314
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,785
Where are you?

315
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,586
<i>I'm in a Ford Econoline van</i>

316
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:31,856
that I'm about
to go get painted.

317
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:34,258
Oh, Andy, Ho ran says
he could get the Picasso.

318
00:19:34,392 --> 00:19:37,460
Oh, Fletch. You must
get it. It's my father's only hope.

319
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:41,165
Well, I'm sure the Italian police are
working around the clock on this case.

320
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:44,302
- Or at least near a clock.
- Do you know where the painting is?

321
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:47,104
<i>Ho ran says he doesn't
keep any art at his building,</i>

322
00:19:47,238 --> 00:19:49,840
so I'm gonna stake out his house
the next couple of nights.

323
00:19:49,974 --> 00:19:52,243
See if he goes anywhere
to get the Picasso.

324
00:19:52,376 --> 00:19:54,511
<i>You need to steal
that painting back, Fletch.</i>

325
00:19:54,644 --> 00:19:57,714
A-All of them, if you can.

326
00:19:57,848 --> 00:19:59,951
Maybe you should get a gun,
just in case.

327
00:20:00,084 --> 00:20:01,718
<i>You must know
a lot of criminals.</i>

328
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:04,587
- Yeah. Andy, I have to call you back.
<i>- What? Fletch!</i>

329
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,500
Whatcha doing?

330
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:20,503
Um...
Nothing.

331
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,106
Where's your permit?

332
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:28,346
Geez. Of course.
I knew it. Unreal.

333
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,480
I'm gonna get out of here.
Unless I'm under arrest,

334
00:20:30,613 --> 00:20:33,126
in which case, I'm listening
very carefully to your instructions,

335
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,819
because we all know
how that shit goes.

336
00:20:34,952 --> 00:20:37,421
Oh, no, no, no. Look, I may
have come across wrong here.

337
00:20:37,554 --> 00:20:38,956
I'm Mike Wahlberg. Mikey Mike.

338
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:42,293
I'm with the City League
Arts Project, the CLAP.

339
00:20:42,426 --> 00:20:43,660
- The Clap?
- I know.

340
00:20:43,794 --> 00:20:45,495
Trust me.
We're work shopping the name,

341
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:49,834
but our mission is to discover and
celebrate some of the young artists

342
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:51,735
here on the streets of Boston.

343
00:20:51,869 --> 00:20:54,071
But who's gonna
see your work here?

344
00:20:54,805 --> 00:20:56,245
My aunt takes this way
to work, so...

345
00:20:56,273 --> 00:20:57,908
Right,
here's what I can do for you.

346
00:20:58,042 --> 00:21:00,677
See that van?
You can paint the whole van.

347
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:03,677
Then, when I drive it around,
people can see your creation.

348
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:04,701
Sounds sketchy.

349
00:21:04,815 --> 00:21:06,760
Well, look, I understand
you might not want to trust

350
00:21:06,784 --> 00:21:08,585
a white guy driving
in an unmarked van

351
00:21:08,718 --> 00:21:12,123
who likes to have conversations
with young people, but I tell you what.

352
00:21:12,256 --> 00:21:15,159
I can give you $300 cash.

353
00:21:15,292 --> 00:21:17,660
You're not making this sound
any less sketchy, bro.

354
00:21:17,795 --> 00:21:19,497
It's for supplies and labor.

355
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:20,730
You trust us?

356
00:21:20,865 --> 00:21:22,833
You're artists, right?

357
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:27,872
If you don't use that van as your mobile
canvas, you're just cheating yourself.

358
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:32,886
I don't know what all that white man
nonsense was, but you got a deal.

359
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,513
Fantastic. All right, I will
be back here, right here.

360
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:37,281
Two days. The whole van painted.

361
00:21:37,415 --> 00:21:40,550
Make sure you sign it,
so the world knows who did it.

362
00:21:40,683 --> 00:21:43,120
Okay. What was your name again?

363
00:21:43,254 --> 00:21:45,622
What did I say? You're
asking us what your name is?

364
00:21:45,756 --> 00:21:47,324
Be inspired.

365
00:21:51,762 --> 00:21:53,696
Five stars, my friend.

366
00:22:18,688 --> 00:22:19,924
Hey!

367
00:22:22,193 --> 00:22:25,529
Oh, fuck! Fuck me.

368
00:22:25,662 --> 00:22:27,364
Oh, sorry. Oh my... Oh!

369
00:22:27,498 --> 00:22:30,935
It's not
cracked. Good for you.

370
00:22:31,068 --> 00:22:35,072
- I just got it fixed. Hi.
- Hi.

371
00:22:35,206 --> 00:22:37,174
Are you the guy
staying in Owen's townhouse?

372
00:22:37,308 --> 00:22:39,543
Yes, uh, Fletch.

373
00:22:39,676 --> 00:22:40,677
Eve.

374
00:22:40,811 --> 00:22:42,012
Hello, Eve.

375
00:22:42,146 --> 00:22:43,666
Did you murder that girl?
No, I didn't.

376
00:22:43,781 --> 00:22:44,781
Did you?
No.

377
00:22:44,815 --> 00:22:47,384
Did Owen?
Who knows?

378
00:22:47,518 --> 00:22:49,595
He has a lot of ladies up there,
but they usually leave alive.

379
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:52,089
So what else
can you tell me about Owen?

380
00:22:52,223 --> 00:22:54,325
Oh, you want to know more
about Owen?

381
00:22:54,825 --> 00:22:55,826
Sure.

382
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,964
- Do you, uh...
- ...smoke?

383
00:23:00,097 --> 00:23:02,542
- Every now and again, sure.
- Okay, well, you should come over.

384
00:23:02,566 --> 00:23:03,508
I live right next door.

385
00:23:03,532 --> 00:23:05,635
Eve, I am under suspicion
of committing murder.

386
00:23:05,769 --> 00:23:07,734
How do you know I'm
not just gonna strangle you?

387
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:10,841
Fletch, you're so naughty.

388
00:23:10,975 --> 00:23:14,478
Okay, let's go,
Mr. Boston Strangler.

389
00:23:14,612 --> 00:23:17,515
My... My
contacts are in the wrong eyes.

390
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:18,883
Here we go.

391
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:22,685
Okay, we are home.

392
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,456
Oh, the power's back on.

393
00:23:25,589 --> 00:23:29,026
I guess my check didn't bounce.
That's good.

394
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,830
Mignon, are you ready? It's
time for dinner. We have a guest.

395
00:23:34,098 --> 00:23:35,866
Glad I tidied up earlier.

396
00:23:36,934 --> 00:23:38,769
I hope you like music, Fletch.
Mmm.

397
00:23:41,738 --> 00:23:43,340
Did you want your keys?

398
00:23:43,474 --> 00:23:46,577
I'm starving.
I'm gonna heat something up.

399
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:49,180
Are you hungry?
Oh, no, I ate yesterday.

400
00:23:49,914 --> 00:23:51,048
Matzo ball soup.

401
00:23:51,182 --> 00:23:52,883
So what's Owen's story?

402
00:23:53,017 --> 00:23:54,852
What's he do for a living?

403
00:23:54,985 --> 00:23:58,155
He's from a very wealthy family,
so he doesn't really have a job,

404
00:23:58,289 --> 00:24:01,325
but he's tried his hand
at a lot of different things.

405
00:24:06,964 --> 00:24:09,867
Um, yeah, for a while
he wanted to be an actor,

406
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,802
but he didn't really know
how to act,

407
00:24:11,936 --> 00:24:16,874
so he started a restaurant that went
out of business before it even opened.

408
00:24:17,007 --> 00:24:19,510
Then he invested in a hotel
that never opened,

409
00:24:19,643 --> 00:24:21,879
and now he's an art broker.

410
00:24:22,012 --> 00:24:23,881
You seem to know a lot
about Owen.

411
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:25,381
Yeah.

412
00:24:25,449 --> 00:24:26,483
Mignon!

413
00:24:26,617 --> 00:24:27,977
Oh, geez.

414
00:24:28,085 --> 00:24:30,421
Wow. That is a lot
for a little dog.

415
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:33,357
She pees when she's hungry.
I do the same thing.

416
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:37,394
Owen goes to Europe a lot,
and I feed his fish when he's gone.

417
00:24:38,162 --> 00:24:40,364
They're all named after artists.

418
00:24:41,131 --> 00:24:44,501
Picasso, Rothko, Frida Kahlo.

419
00:24:45,869 --> 00:24:48,639
Owen and I are friends. I never
want to say anything bad about him,

420
00:24:48,772 --> 00:24:50,608
but he is very pretentious.

421
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,142
Hmm.

422
00:24:52,276 --> 00:24:54,511
Mignon, you want some chicken?

423
00:24:54,645 --> 00:24:56,022
You want chicken?

424
00:24:56,046 --> 00:24:59,016
This townhouse
is broken up into condos

425
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:00,393
and I've lived here the longest,

426
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:02,052
before the rich people
moved in upstairs

427
00:25:02,186 --> 00:25:04,054
and started the "no pets" rule.

428
00:25:04,188 --> 00:25:07,658
They said I could keep Mignon, but
when she died, I couldn't get another dog,

429
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:13,330
but the joke's on them,
because this is my third Mignon.

430
00:25:13,464 --> 00:25:16,834
When one dies, I just get another
one that looks exactly the same.

431
00:25:16,967 --> 00:25:19,136
And they think
I have a 25-year-old dog,

432
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:23,040
because rich people
are so oblivious.

433
00:25:23,173 --> 00:25:24,775
Like, I don't know what it is.

434
00:25:24,908 --> 00:25:27,111
People get a bunch of money
and... Oops.

435
00:25:27,244 --> 00:25:30,080
- Your scarf was on fire.
- Oh, thank you.

436
00:25:30,214 --> 00:25:33,752
Yeah, I hung out with Owen
a lot this last year,

437
00:25:33,884 --> 00:25:35,486
when his wife left him.

438
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:38,422
I kind of became his
quasi-shrink. We talked a lot.

439
00:25:38,555 --> 00:25:41,392
He'd come down here.
We'd smoke. He'd cry.

440
00:25:42,326 --> 00:25:44,028
I've been through divorce.
Yeah.

441
00:25:44,161 --> 00:25:46,630
That's how I got
this apartment. Oh.

442
00:25:46,765 --> 00:25:49,768
Well, it wasn't really divorce.

443
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:53,404
He died on the toilet, but
nobody wants to hear that story.

444
00:25:53,537 --> 00:25:54,972
No, we sure don't.

445
00:25:55,539 --> 00:25:56,974
But Owen is divorced?

446
00:25:57,107 --> 00:25:59,576
Um, not officially.
Whoa. Okay.

447
00:26:00,444 --> 00:26:03,914
His ex Tatiana,
she's making it complicated.

448
00:26:04,048 --> 00:26:06,283
I don't want to say
anything bad about Tatiana,

449
00:26:07,051 --> 00:26:10,220
but she's a detestable person.

450
00:26:10,354 --> 00:26:12,757
She calls herself a lifestyle
curator, a thought leader.

451
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,124
What is that?

452
00:26:15,025 --> 00:26:16,025
Not familiar with it.

453
00:26:16,126 --> 00:26:17,528
Owen financed her company,

454
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:18,829
now she wants to cut him out

455
00:26:18,962 --> 00:26:20,631
and she wants full custody
of their child.

456
00:26:20,765 --> 00:26:22,833
Huh.
Owen is a good dad.

457
00:26:22,966 --> 00:26:24,968
Tatiana really,
really, really...

458
00:26:25,102 --> 00:26:26,737
Just... Just be careful.

459
00:26:26,904 --> 00:26:27,938
...really sucks. Oh.

460
00:26:28,072 --> 00:26:29,239
Yeah, you got it.

461
00:26:29,373 --> 00:26:31,108
You got it right
in the thing there. Oops.

462
00:26:31,241 --> 00:26:33,253
I mean, Tatiana is hot
if you like that sort of thing.

463
00:26:33,277 --> 00:26:34,678
That's... That's gonna... Ooh.

464
00:26:34,813 --> 00:26:36,380
But she is so mean to Owen.

465
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:38,649
People are weird. They
like being treated like shit...

466
00:26:38,783 --> 00:26:40,026
- Please, just... Good Lord.
- Oh.

467
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,885
- I really cut myself.
- Yeah, you did.

468
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:44,264
Put some pressure on that. The
knife was so sharp, I didn't even feel it.

469
00:26:44,288 --> 00:26:45,889
Put... Wrap it up.

470
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:47,458
Anyway, that's Owen's story.

471
00:26:47,591 --> 00:26:48,726
And there's more stuff,

472
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:50,219
but I don't wanna
betray his trust.

473
00:26:50,294 --> 00:26:51,763
Please, I totally understand.

474
00:26:51,895 --> 00:26:53,130
Drinking a lot.

475
00:26:53,832 --> 00:26:55,165
- Hard drugs.
- Ooh.

476
00:26:55,299 --> 00:26:57,634
I don't want to say which ones.

477
00:27:00,104 --> 00:27:04,441
It's like Percocet, Oxy, Molly.

478
00:27:05,376 --> 00:27:07,745
Drugs are no way to deal
with your problems. No.

479
00:27:07,878 --> 00:27:09,480
It sounds like
you really care for Owen.

480
00:27:09,613 --> 00:27:13,417
What? That is personal. Just
a habit. I ask a lot of questions.

481
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,788
I used to be an investigative
reporter. I am not in love with Owen.

482
00:27:18,355 --> 00:27:20,124
I never said you were.
You didn't?

483
00:27:20,257 --> 00:27:21,760
- No.
- Oh. Well, I...

484
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:24,094
Okay. I thought maybe
that's what you said.

485
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:26,230
Mignon,
get your foot out of this pan.

486
00:27:26,363 --> 00:27:28,365
Yeah, that's the pan.
That's the one.

487
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,603
Really? You're gonna...
You're gonna eat that? Yeah.

488
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,972
Maybe not that piece.
Yeah, well, not this one.

489
00:27:35,105 --> 00:27:36,306
This one's bloody.
Mm-hmm.

490
00:27:36,808 --> 00:27:38,409
Yup.
Sorry.

491
00:27:38,542 --> 00:27:42,146
So Owen didn't kill that girl,
but they are gonna suspect him.

492
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:44,290
Why are they gonna suspect him?

493
00:27:44,314 --> 00:27:46,417
Well, he got arrested
a few months ago.

494
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,550
Oh, no.

495
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,944
I probably
shouldn't tell you that.

496
00:27:48,986 --> 00:27:52,022
Well, what, uh... What happened?

497
00:27:52,156 --> 00:27:54,558
Well, okay.

498
00:27:54,691 --> 00:27:56,226
Whoa. More fire. More fire.

499
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,395
Oh, it'll burn off.

500
00:27:58,529 --> 00:28:02,867
Um, so there's this banker that lives
on the fourth floor, he's kind of a dick.

501
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,435
He and Owen
got in a little fight.

502
00:28:04,568 --> 00:28:07,171
Really?
And why was only Owen arrested?

503
00:28:07,304 --> 00:28:10,707
What is this?
Woodbird and Bernstein?

504
00:28:10,842 --> 00:28:12,643
Almost.
Owen is a good guy.

505
00:28:12,777 --> 00:28:14,411
I'm not in love with him.

506
00:28:14,545 --> 00:28:15,579
Matzo ball soup?

507
00:28:15,712 --> 00:28:17,512
You know what,
as much as I would love to eat,

508
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:19,516
- I... I really have to be going.
- Oh.

509
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:24,188
But if you hear anything else about
the murder, you let me know, okay?

510
00:28:24,321 --> 00:28:26,690
Sure, Fletch.
Okay.

511
00:28:26,825 --> 00:28:28,459
Bye-bye, Mignon.

512
00:28:31,796 --> 00:28:35,767
God, again? What is
this? The battery?

513
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,001
Mignon, shush.

514
00:28:40,103 --> 00:28:41,371
I got it, Fletch.

515
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:43,574
Mignon!

516
00:28:44,174 --> 00:28:45,676
See ya, Fletch.

517
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,730
<i>PETA is
not a big fan of this idea.</i>

518
00:28:47,812 --> 00:28:50,113
<i>They balance their body
temperatures through their skin.</i>

519
00:28:50,247 --> 00:28:52,683
<i>That's why pigs like to roll
around in mud or puddles</i>

520
00:28:52,817 --> 00:28:53,952
<i>to cool off on warm days.</i>

521
00:28:54,084 --> 00:28:55,719
<i>They have very few sweat glands</i>

522
00:28:55,854 --> 00:28:58,031
<i>and they don't release body
heat through sweating like we do.</i>

523
00:28:58,055 --> 00:29:00,266
<i>So, the saying "sweating
like a pig" is, like, total bullshit?</i>

524
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:03,862
<i>Well, that phrase actually
comes from smelting of iron ore to...</i>

525
00:29:14,104 --> 00:29:15,305
Okay.

526
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:26,985
Good evening, Inspector.

527
00:29:27,117 --> 00:29:29,419
What brings you to Back Bay,
Mr. Fletcher?

528
00:29:29,553 --> 00:29:32,556
You know, I just love
listening to podcasts in my car.

529
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,826
Particularly interesting one
on pigs.

530
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:36,293
Did you know they don't sweat?

531
00:29:36,426 --> 00:29:39,029
And they have the longest
orgasms of any mammal.

532
00:29:39,162 --> 00:29:41,407
Would you mind stepping out
of the car please, Mr. Fletcher?

533
00:29:41,431 --> 00:29:44,601
Okay, but I'll only stay
for two or three insults.

534
00:29:44,735 --> 00:29:45,803
Four, max.

535
00:29:46,971 --> 00:29:50,741
This is a nice car for a
broke asshole. That's one.

536
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:55,112
No one seems to remember you
from the Warren Tavern last night.

537
00:29:55,245 --> 00:29:56,523
I don't remember
any of them either.

538
00:29:56,547 --> 00:29:58,057
Come back with me
to police headquarters.

539
00:29:58,081 --> 00:29:59,225
I still have
a few more questions.

540
00:29:59,249 --> 00:30:00,985
You know, I would love to, uh,

541
00:30:01,118 --> 00:30:03,798
but I'm meeting the head of the
Tharp Foundation for dinner tonight.

542
00:30:03,855 --> 00:30:07,090
You can either come voluntarily
or I can arrest you.

543
00:30:07,859 --> 00:30:09,359
I get it.

544
00:30:09,493 --> 00:30:12,529
You want my help.
Okay. How'd you find me?

545
00:30:12,663 --> 00:30:14,531
We police get to keep
some secrets, Mr. Fletch.

546
00:30:14,665 --> 00:30:17,001
And those civil liberties
are so pesky.

547
00:30:17,134 --> 00:30:18,569
Hi, Griz.
Hello.

548
00:30:18,702 --> 00:30:19,702
Did you miss me?

549
00:30:19,771 --> 00:30:20,805
No.

550
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:24,818
Hey, guys, is there a way
we can call in a coffee order?

551
00:30:24,842 --> 00:30:27,544
I'd kill for a macchiato.
Not literally.

552
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:41,124
Nice job, Griz. Four
stars. Your back seat's filthy.

553
00:30:41,993 --> 00:30:43,694
Anybody up there watching live?

554
00:30:44,762 --> 00:30:47,297
They gotta hear about
pig orgasms. Pig what?

555
00:30:47,431 --> 00:30:49,499
Don't... Don't...
Don't encourage him.

556
00:30:49,633 --> 00:30:52,070
You should Google it, Griz.
You would not be disappointed.

557
00:30:53,203 --> 00:30:56,306
So what do we know about this
victim? Like we're gonna tell you.

558
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,717
Laurel Goodwin's from Worcester.

559
00:30:57,741 --> 00:30:59,610
Was living in Allston
with two roommates.

560
00:30:59,743 --> 00:31:02,379
Worked at a Cambridge Café
as a barista.

561
00:31:02,512 --> 00:31:03,915
W-We're telling you.

562
00:31:04,048 --> 00:31:08,652
Ms. Goodwin was pursuing
a career in the art world.

563
00:31:08,786 --> 00:31:10,386
- Hmm.
- Interesting connection.

564
00:31:10,487 --> 00:31:13,657
Well, I either just
walked into a frame up

565
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:16,593
or, uh, somebody from my past
is trying to get revenge on me.

566
00:31:16,727 --> 00:31:18,997
Who hates you?

567
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:20,597
Besides Griz.

568
00:31:20,731 --> 00:31:23,067
Well, I did put quite a few
prominent people away

569
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,369
when I was
a very famous reporter

570
00:31:25,502 --> 00:31:27,038
at the <i>News Tribune</i>
in Los Angeles.

571
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:28,973
I looked into
your criminal record.

572
00:31:29,107 --> 00:31:30,107
And?

573
00:31:30,173 --> 00:31:31,174
Bad check charge.

574
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:34,354
Two contempt of court charges.

575
00:31:34,378 --> 00:31:37,347
A number of non-payment
of alimony charges.

576
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:40,752
100 percent of most of those
were dismissed.

577
00:31:41,886 --> 00:31:43,988
You're a bit of a shady
character, Mr. Fletcher.

578
00:31:44,122 --> 00:31:45,957
But I am adorable.

579
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:49,794
Come on, guys. Look, all of the
pertinent information isn't even in yet.

580
00:31:49,927 --> 00:31:53,697
Did you even talk to or interview
this... this next-door neighbor, Eve?

581
00:31:53,831 --> 00:31:56,010
I mean, she had some very
interesting thoughts about Mr. Tasserly.

582
00:31:56,034 --> 00:31:57,902
When I showed Eve a picture
of Laurel Goodwin,

583
00:31:58,036 --> 00:32:01,338
she said that she remembered
seeing her the night of the murder.

584
00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:04,108
With a man
who fits your description.

585
00:32:04,241 --> 00:32:06,844
Well, Eve is a stoner. I wouldn't
trust anything she has to say.

586
00:32:06,978 --> 00:32:09,819
We found your
fingerprints on the wine bottle.

587
00:32:09,843 --> 00:32:10,843
So?

588
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:13,216
It's the murder weapon.

589
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,281
Huh.

590
00:32:14,305 --> 00:32:17,121
Minute traces of hair and
blood from that young woman.

591
00:32:17,254 --> 00:32:20,992
You guys, look, that bottle
was left on top of a welcome note

592
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:22,659
for me as a gift.

593
00:32:22,794 --> 00:32:25,262
It was set up that way
so I would have to pick it up.

594
00:32:25,395 --> 00:32:26,931
What note?

595
00:32:27,065 --> 00:32:29,666
Oh, God, I forgot to give
you it. Here. I still have it.

596
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:32,636
Withholding evidence.
Not suspicious at all.

597
00:32:34,772 --> 00:32:35,505
"Mr. Locke"?

598
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:37,240
My pen name. Ralph Locke.

599
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:38,910
Sounds made up.

600
00:32:39,476 --> 00:32:40,845
It's a pen name.

601
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:44,048
"Enjoy your stay."

602
00:32:44,182 --> 00:32:47,752
Yeah, Griz, you better run that
down to forensics, <i>tout de suite.</i>

603
00:32:49,787 --> 00:32:52,790
Oh, are you Ferberizing?
Is that why you're tired?

604
00:32:52,924 --> 00:32:56,160
Yeah, yeah, we are actually.
We're Ferberizing him.

605
00:32:57,195 --> 00:33:00,297
I never knew any creature
on earth could just cry so much.

606
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:04,701
But it's gonna be so worth it
when Charlie can self soothe. Cute!

607
00:33:04,836 --> 00:33:08,438
She's not wrong,
but you have to stick with it.

608
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,844
You shook a police tail today.
You rented a fast car.

609
00:33:12,977 --> 00:33:14,912
Your fingerprints
are on the murder weapon,

610
00:33:15,046 --> 00:33:18,548
and someone matching your
description was seen with the victim.

611
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:20,350
I could arrest you.

612
00:33:20,484 --> 00:33:21,795
And we're not
going to arrest him?

613
00:33:21,819 --> 00:33:23,888
Who wants to do that paperwork?
Am I right?

614
00:33:25,388 --> 00:33:29,193
If you did it, Irwin,
I will catch you.

615
00:33:29,994 --> 00:33:31,763
I don't like people
calling me Irwin.

616
00:33:31,896 --> 00:33:34,832
Dang! Pigs have
crazy long orgasms!

617
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,503
Hey!

618
00:34:21,678 --> 00:34:22,746
Hey!

619
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,915
Fuck!

620
00:34:24,347 --> 00:34:25,783
Hey!

621
00:34:33,423 --> 00:34:35,760
Ow.

622
00:34:49,073 --> 00:34:50,707
- I'm here to...
- No.

623
00:34:51,242 --> 00:34:52,475
Yes.

624
00:34:53,443 --> 00:34:54,678
Okay.

625
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:56,147
Bye.

626
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,915
I'm here to see Frank Jaffe.

627
00:34:58,049 --> 00:35:00,684
Do you have a meeting?
No, just tell him Fletch is here.

628
00:35:00,818 --> 00:35:02,753
Is that a first name
or a last name?

629
00:35:02,887 --> 00:35:04,088
Just Fletch.

630
00:35:04,222 --> 00:35:05,522
Just Fletch?

631
00:35:06,423 --> 00:35:07,724
Cool.

632
00:35:08,391 --> 00:35:11,162
Larry, you let this prick in?

633
00:35:11,295 --> 00:35:13,363
Hi, Frank. Thank you.

634
00:35:14,698 --> 00:35:17,335
"Brown Out."
Septic tank explosion.

635
00:35:17,467 --> 00:35:18,535
I get it. Very clever.

636
00:35:18,668 --> 00:35:20,271
Did the Pulitzer committee
see this?

637
00:35:20,403 --> 00:35:21,906
Fuck you.
You still owe me money.

638
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:23,174
What? No, I don't.

639
00:35:23,307 --> 00:35:24,909
Yes, you do.
For what?

640
00:35:25,042 --> 00:35:27,054
For charging a fuck load of
ridiculous shit to the <i>News Tribune</i>

641
00:35:27,078 --> 00:35:28,745
and leaving town.
I had to pay for it.

642
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,381
You rented a fucking carriage
horse. Language.

643
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,484
I paid you back.
No, you didn't.

644
00:35:34,618 --> 00:35:36,029
I apologized for
not paying you back.

645
00:35:36,053 --> 00:35:38,055
No, you didn't.
Well, I meant to.

646
00:35:38,189 --> 00:35:41,292
Listen, where is everybody?
They're still working from home.

647
00:35:41,424 --> 00:35:43,294
Can you believe it?
The fucking babies.

648
00:35:43,426 --> 00:35:44,962
The place is like
a silent retreat.

649
00:35:45,096 --> 00:35:47,731
And these goddamn millennials,
they're so respectful.

650
00:35:47,865 --> 00:35:49,675
I can't tell you how much
I fucking hate this place.

651
00:35:49,699 --> 00:35:51,202
You didn't bring anybody
from LA?

652
00:35:51,335 --> 00:35:53,037
Just Pete who does The Jumble.

653
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,504
Hey, Pete!

654
00:35:55,373 --> 00:35:56,673
Hey, Fletch.

655
00:35:57,141 --> 00:35:58,441
Jesus.

656
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:00,510
I hate Pete too.
Mr. Excitement.

657
00:36:00,644 --> 00:36:01,889
What do you want, Fletch?

658
00:36:01,913 --> 00:36:03,314
Can I talk to you
in your office?

659
00:36:03,446 --> 00:36:04,886
My office is
a fucking goldfish bowl.

660
00:36:05,016 --> 00:36:06,716
I can't even scratch
my nuts in there.

661
00:36:06,851 --> 00:36:08,585
Let's go to my real office.

662
00:36:08,718 --> 00:36:11,521
But you can't wear that hat.
They'll chop your fucking head off.

663
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:16,593
What brings you to Boston?

664
00:36:16,726 --> 00:36:19,039
'Cause if you're looking for a job at
a newspaper, you're a fucking idiot,

665
00:36:19,063 --> 00:36:20,197
but I could use you.

666
00:36:20,331 --> 00:36:23,134
I have retired from
reporting. Oh, good for you.

667
00:36:23,267 --> 00:36:29,539
Mmm. Do you happen to know if luxury rental
cars have hidden GPS trackers in them?

668
00:36:29,673 --> 00:36:31,943
They do. In case
people steal them. Why?

669
00:36:32,076 --> 00:36:35,212
Well, the police are
following me around.

670
00:36:35,346 --> 00:36:38,082
Oh, good. I hope it's for something
serious. I need a pick me up.

671
00:36:38,215 --> 00:36:41,819
First night I'm here,
I get accused of murder.

672
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,122
What?
Wait, the girl on the south end?

673
00:36:45,256 --> 00:36:46,924
That's the one, yes.

674
00:36:47,058 --> 00:36:49,961
Uh, you ever come across
this Detective Morris Monroe?

675
00:36:50,094 --> 00:36:51,762
He seems to think
that I'm the culprit.

676
00:36:51,896 --> 00:36:55,333
Really? Yeah, he's a smart guy.

677
00:36:56,167 --> 00:36:57,935
His father was a cop.
He's from Dorchester.

678
00:36:58,069 --> 00:36:59,770
Uh... They call him
"Slow Mo Monroe",

679
00:36:59,904 --> 00:37:02,206
because he, uh, takes so long
to solve cases,

680
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,541
but he solves a lot of cases.

681
00:37:04,674 --> 00:37:06,114
You think you could
pull some strings

682
00:37:06,143 --> 00:37:08,846
and, uh, find a police
report on someone for me?

683
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,216
No, Fletch. No way.
Way too big an ask.

684
00:37:13,084 --> 00:37:15,453
Oh. Just be a real shame
if Daphne found out

685
00:37:15,585 --> 00:37:19,589
that you defiled Clara Snow in
the supply closet all those years ago.

686
00:37:19,723 --> 00:37:21,524
I mean, especially
in today's climate.

687
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:23,660
- Mmm.
- You were her boss.

688
00:37:23,794 --> 00:37:27,731
First of all, it wasn't the supply
closet. It was the copy room.

689
00:37:27,865 --> 00:37:30,567
And it was a bilateral defiling.

690
00:37:31,735 --> 00:37:33,270
Are you really trying
to blackmail me?

691
00:37:34,171 --> 00:37:35,605
Kinda.

692
00:37:35,739 --> 00:37:37,707
- You wouldn't.
- No, you're probably right.

693
00:37:37,842 --> 00:37:41,078
On the other hand, I am still
under suspicion for murder.

694
00:37:42,913 --> 00:37:46,250
Whose police report?
Owen Tasserly.

695
00:37:46,384 --> 00:37:47,504
Write it down, you old lush.

696
00:37:48,685 --> 00:37:51,125
He was arrested a while back
for something. I don't know what.

697
00:37:51,222 --> 00:37:53,590
But I think he might be
the actual murderer.

698
00:37:53,723 --> 00:37:55,259
I'll see what I can do.

699
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,094
Thank you.

700
00:37:58,195 --> 00:38:01,832
But hey, if you did kill
that girl, do the right thing.

701
00:38:02,565 --> 00:38:04,601
And give me an exclusive.

702
00:38:05,602 --> 00:38:07,304
Almost great seeing you again,
Frank.

703
00:38:08,105 --> 00:38:10,207
Just glad you kept
your fucking shoes on.

704
00:38:11,108 --> 00:38:13,710
Uh, hi,
is this Tatiana Tasserly?

705
00:38:14,544 --> 00:38:15,946
Yes, uh, it's Frank Jaffe.

706
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,215
I'm the style editor
over at the <i>Boston Sentinel.</i>

707
00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:20,818
Listen, we were thinking
of doing a little piece

708
00:38:20,951 --> 00:38:23,087
on Boston's top
lifestyle curators

709
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,990
and your name was
on the top of our list.

710
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,724
I know.

711
00:38:28,893 --> 00:38:31,429
Well, that's just wonderful.
I would love to do that.

712
00:38:32,029 --> 00:38:34,631
I want a room to tell a story

713
00:38:34,765 --> 00:38:37,968
and all the pieces
are the characters.

714
00:38:38,102 --> 00:38:40,771
I wanna feel like I'm in the
middle of a conversation.

715
00:38:40,905 --> 00:38:42,239
Between inanimate objects.
Right.

716
00:38:42,373 --> 00:38:44,875
Genius. Oh, my
gosh, and this thing?

717
00:38:45,009 --> 00:38:48,379
Oh... This idea of the
branch in the vase?

718
00:38:48,512 --> 00:38:50,514
I have...
How do you come up with this?

719
00:38:50,647 --> 00:38:53,451
- I... I've only seen branches on trees!
- Right. I know.

720
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:54,785
I'm really giving it a moment,

721
00:38:54,919 --> 00:38:58,655
which lures the eye
to this gorgeous table.

722
00:38:58,789 --> 00:39:02,725
And I got this, Frank,
from a convent in Cuba.

723
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,363
Wow. Those Cuban nuns
must be very proud.

724
00:39:06,497 --> 00:39:07,361
Right?

725
00:39:07,385 --> 00:39:10,000
Even if they don't have
anywhere to eat anymore. Huh?

726
00:39:10,134 --> 00:39:12,937
Every single piece I curate
is bespoke.

727
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:16,440
Ooh. Bespoke.
I love that word.

728
00:39:16,574 --> 00:39:17,574
What does it mean again?

729
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,043
Bespoke?
Bespoke.

730
00:39:19,176 --> 00:39:24,448
- Uh, it's when an object bespeaks. It...
- Right.

731
00:39:24,582 --> 00:39:25,983
...be-talks.

732
00:39:26,117 --> 00:39:27,751
It... No, wait.

733
00:39:30,154 --> 00:39:35,692
It be-teaches us
something about ourselves.

734
00:39:37,428 --> 00:39:38,796
Wow. Thank you.
Yeah.

735
00:39:38,929 --> 00:39:40,564
I think I have my pull quote.

736
00:39:40,697 --> 00:39:44,368
I mean, so many people, Frank,
are trapped in a world of sameness.

737
00:39:44,502 --> 00:39:49,140
I just want to surround them
with beautiful things.

738
00:39:49,273 --> 00:39:52,109
Beautiful clothes.
Beautiful food.

739
00:39:52,243 --> 00:39:55,212
Don't you just hate people who
are too poor to afford beauty?

740
00:39:56,881 --> 00:39:58,648
Um...

741
00:39:58,782 --> 00:40:01,185
The worst.

742
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:03,821
Well...

743
00:40:03,954 --> 00:40:06,991
Anyway, you're currently separated
from your husband, Owen Tasserly.

744
00:40:07,124 --> 00:40:09,226
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
Okay.

745
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,263
Uh, now, is he still co-owner
of Chez Aesthetica?

746
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:15,366
We had an evolved
and harmonious disuniting.

747
00:40:15,499 --> 00:40:17,535
And he decided to
leave the company. Hmm.

748
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:21,939
Now, I... I'm sure you heard of the
unfortunate incident at his townhouse.

749
00:40:22,072 --> 00:40:24,341
The... The murdered woman.
Yikes.

750
00:40:24,475 --> 00:40:26,911
We've been reporting on it
in the paper.

751
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:30,747
We were totally shocked,
of course, um...

752
00:40:30,881 --> 00:40:33,751
Well, Owen's been away
traveling in Europe.

753
00:40:33,884 --> 00:40:35,718
Right.
So...

754
00:40:37,321 --> 00:40:40,891
I'm always looking for ways
to actuate the senses, so...

755
00:40:41,025 --> 00:40:44,261
Yeah, of course,
but if I could just follow up.

756
00:40:44,395 --> 00:40:46,997
You would make me kind
of a hero back at the office,

757
00:40:47,131 --> 00:40:48,966
if you could give me
any kind of clue

758
00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:51,635
as to who might have
committed that murder.

759
00:40:51,769 --> 00:40:53,604
Frank, sorry,
I can't help you there.

760
00:40:53,736 --> 00:40:55,239
Um...

761
00:40:57,141 --> 00:40:58,576
But Owen can be
so irresponsible.

762
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:00,411
So many people have keys
to that house.

763
00:41:00,544 --> 00:41:02,146
His housekeeper, his trainer,

764
00:41:02,279 --> 00:41:06,150
his pothead neighbor who feeds
his fish, and God knows who else.

765
00:41:07,251 --> 00:41:09,091
Why doesn't he just
change the lock?

766
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,489
Frank, I have told him
a million times.

767
00:41:14,558 --> 00:41:17,194
Owen can be
such a fucking idiot sometimes.

768
00:41:17,328 --> 00:41:18,796
Hmm.

769
00:41:18,929 --> 00:41:22,099
I'm so happy you're here,
Frank. Such a fan.

770
00:41:40,217 --> 00:41:41,895
- More water.
- Your Negroni.

771
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:44,321
<i>- Oh, grazie. Grazie.</i>
- Some olives.

772
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,061
Ah, thank you.

773
00:41:51,462 --> 00:41:52,663
It's so nice.

774
00:41:52,796 --> 00:41:56,367
Ah, Fletch, you're late.

775
00:41:58,736 --> 00:41:59,980
Can I get you a drink?
Yes, please.

776
00:42:00,004 --> 00:42:01,839
A vodka gimlet.
Thank you very much.

777
00:42:01,972 --> 00:42:03,607
The staff seems
very smitten with you.

778
00:42:03,741 --> 00:42:07,745
Fletch, I am not going to have
any of your American double-talk.

779
00:42:07,878 --> 00:42:10,381
I want truth.
Where are my paintings?

780
00:42:10,514 --> 00:42:13,384
Well, see, here I thought
they were the Count's paintings.

781
00:42:13,517 --> 00:42:16,287
Oh, the Count is dead.

782
00:42:16,787 --> 00:42:17,988
How do you know this?

783
00:42:18,122 --> 00:42:21,258
I know in my heart.
The pain I feel.

784
00:42:22,826 --> 00:42:24,328
You and Angela think

785
00:42:24,461 --> 00:42:28,999
I was only with my Menti,
my <i>pequeno javali,</i> for money,

786
00:42:29,133 --> 00:42:31,068
but this is lies.

787
00:42:31,201 --> 00:42:32,569
<i>Pequeno javali?</i>

788
00:42:32,703 --> 00:42:37,207
Mmm.
"Little boar" in Portuguese.

789
00:42:37,341 --> 00:42:41,578
I am half Brazilian, also
half Italian and half French.

790
00:42:41,712 --> 00:42:43,614
That's, uh... Huh.

791
00:42:43,747 --> 00:42:48,552
Uh... And what is the Countess doing here
in Boston in this very expensive hotel?

792
00:42:48,686 --> 00:42:49,686
Thank you very much.

793
00:42:49,754 --> 00:42:51,155
I come to stop you.

794
00:42:51,288 --> 00:42:55,926
I know that you and Angela
plan to rob my paintings.

795
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,796
Confess, Fletch.

796
00:42:57,928 --> 00:43:01,265
I'm sorry, how do I know that,
uh, you didn't take the paintings?

797
00:43:01,398 --> 00:43:04,635
Or have the Count kidnapped
or murdered?

798
00:43:04,769 --> 00:43:08,906
I loved my Menti. I would
do nothing to harm him.

799
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:11,909
I did not steal the paintings.

800
00:43:12,042 --> 00:43:15,212
Fletch, if I murder anyone,
I will murder you.

801
00:43:16,714 --> 00:43:20,250
Now, Fletch, come up to my room.

802
00:43:20,384 --> 00:43:22,119
I have something to show you.

803
00:43:22,252 --> 00:43:24,121
Well, that's not gonna happen,
Your Highness.

804
00:43:24,254 --> 00:43:26,724
Fine. I go up
and come back to show you.

805
00:43:26,857 --> 00:43:28,827
Order me another drink.

806
00:43:28,959 --> 00:43:30,194
<i>Grazie.</i>

807
00:43:36,801 --> 00:43:38,035
Okay.

808
00:43:39,937 --> 00:43:42,373
Morris, I thought I'd stop by.

809
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:46,377
I couldn't... He just came here.

810
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,946
You're enjoying this,
aren't you? Very much so.

811
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:51,515
It's quite satisfying.
What? No day care today?

812
00:43:51,648 --> 00:43:54,819
My wife had a doctor's appointment.
My nanny is, um, indisposed.

813
00:43:54,952 --> 00:43:56,520
It's her support dog's birthday.

814
00:43:56,653 --> 00:43:59,132
Is that dog registered anywhere?
I'd love to send it something.

815
00:43:59,156 --> 00:44:00,500
Okay, look,
are you here to confess?

816
00:44:00,524 --> 00:44:02,526
No, but I did have some ideas
about the case.

817
00:44:02,659 --> 00:44:05,429
Goddamn it! We are not working
on this case together, Irwin.

818
00:44:08,365 --> 00:44:11,602
Come on, just hear me out.
What is happening?

819
00:44:12,069 --> 00:44:14,138
What?

820
00:44:14,271 --> 00:44:15,874
Hands can parade around naked
all day,

821
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:17,574
but God forbid
you show a few toes?

822
00:44:17,708 --> 00:44:19,419
Now, come on. Let's talk
about the suspects here.

823
00:44:19,443 --> 00:44:22,413
Number one. Tatiana
Tasserly, Owen's ex-wife.

824
00:44:22,546 --> 00:44:24,748
- Who you dropped in on today.
- Yes, I did.

825
00:44:24,883 --> 00:44:27,985
Maybe she didn't know Owen was out
of town, and she wanted to frame him.

826
00:44:28,118 --> 00:44:30,187
- Why?
- Acrimonious divorce.

827
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,656
She wants control over
the company that they share

828
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:34,024
and custody of their daughter.

829
00:44:34,158 --> 00:44:36,660
Tatiana Tasserly
was in yoga class that night.

830
00:44:36,795 --> 00:44:38,328
Vinyasa or Bikram?

831
00:44:39,396 --> 00:44:40,865
We'll get back to that.

832
00:44:40,998 --> 00:44:43,066
She could have hired somebody
to do the job.

833
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,269
Second, Eve, the neighbor.

834
00:44:45,402 --> 00:44:47,337
She has a key
to Owen's townhouse,

835
00:44:47,471 --> 00:44:49,406
she feeds his fish
while he's out of town

836
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:52,709
and just happens to be in love
with him. She admitted it to me.

837
00:44:52,844 --> 00:44:56,881
O-Okay. Okay. W-What you're doing
right now, that's called witness tampering.

838
00:44:57,014 --> 00:44:58,715
You're just begging me
to arrest you.

839
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:02,186
Come on, Morris. You want me on
the outside, so I can solve this thing,

840
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:04,063
and then you can take the credit.

841
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:09,626
It's okay, look at the
cow. Look at Mr. Moo. Mr. Moo.

842
00:45:09,761 --> 00:45:12,396
Daddy's got to talk
to the murderer right now.

843
00:45:12,529 --> 00:45:14,298
The only reason
I haven't arrested you yet

844
00:45:14,431 --> 00:45:17,501
is because I enjoy watching
you dig a deeper hole for yourself.

845
00:45:17,634 --> 00:45:20,637
Eve has a motive.
Rejection, jealousy.

846
00:45:20,772 --> 00:45:23,040
I hope it's not Eve though.
I really like her.

847
00:45:23,173 --> 00:45:24,241
Such compassion.

848
00:45:24,374 --> 00:45:27,244
And then, of course,
Tasserly himself.

849
00:45:27,377 --> 00:45:29,980
I mean, it is his townhouse.

850
00:45:32,082 --> 00:45:35,285
Tasserly was on a flight to
Paris at 5:27 p.m. that night.

851
00:45:35,419 --> 00:45:37,988
Plenty of time to do a murder
before you get on that plane.

852
00:45:38,121 --> 00:45:39,623
Coroner has time of death
at 9:00 p.m.

853
00:45:39,757 --> 00:45:41,557
You're gonna trust a coroner?
They're weirdos.

854
00:45:41,658 --> 00:45:42,861
Tasserly's motive?

855
00:45:42,993 --> 00:45:44,637
He's been a lunatic
since his wife left him.

856
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:46,965
Oh, and someone broke
into his house last night.

857
00:45:47,097 --> 00:45:49,777
I don't know who it was. Couldn't
get a good look, but he had a beard.

858
00:45:49,801 --> 00:45:52,369
Might have been Tasserly.
He might be back in town.

859
00:45:52,503 --> 00:45:54,571
Owen Tasserly broke into
his own house?

860
00:45:56,406 --> 00:45:57,942
Criminal mastermind.

861
00:45:58,075 --> 00:46:00,310
Whoever it was
did not want to get caught.

862
00:46:00,444 --> 00:46:02,981
He take anything?
Not that I could tell.

863
00:46:03,113 --> 00:46:04,348
Lakers fan?

864
00:46:05,048 --> 00:46:07,117
What do you think?
What about you?

865
00:46:08,151 --> 00:46:10,053
What do you think?

866
00:46:10,187 --> 00:46:12,256
Charlie, Charlie...
Charlie, I get it.

867
00:46:12,389 --> 00:46:14,725
I'd be crying too
if I was a Celtics fan.

868
00:46:15,526 --> 00:46:17,327
Person of interest
leaving the building.

869
00:46:18,128 --> 00:46:19,696
Slow Mo, he's getting away!

870
00:46:19,831 --> 00:46:22,041
Watch it, pal. He'll arrest
you at your retirement dinner.

871
00:46:22,065 --> 00:46:25,035
Hey, guy, don't worry. Monroe's
not even sure who shot Lincoln.

872
00:46:27,271 --> 00:46:29,640
Somebody solve a crime.
How about that?

873
00:46:31,943 --> 00:46:33,143
Can you just...

874
00:46:33,277 --> 00:46:35,312
Oh, thank you. Go
ahead. After you. Okay.

875
00:46:37,614 --> 00:46:38,715
Are you...

876
00:46:39,817 --> 00:46:41,485
Uh... Uh, are we going up?

877
00:46:41,986 --> 00:46:43,220
God bless her.

878
00:47:04,641 --> 00:47:05,676
Hmm.

879
00:47:32,402 --> 00:47:33,838
Oh, he's on the move.

880
00:47:33,972 --> 00:47:36,253
If he crosses the state line,
I want to see where he goes.

881
00:47:36,373 --> 00:47:37,674
Hey, you coming?
No.

882
00:47:37,809 --> 00:47:39,576
"No." Love that.

883
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:43,915
<i>Hummingbirds have a
metabolism 77 times faster than ours.</i>

884
00:47:44,048 --> 00:47:47,551
<i>I got a hybrid diet
craze that's just around the corner.</i>

885
00:48:31,896 --> 00:48:33,330
Mr. Ho ran. How are you?

886
00:48:33,463 --> 00:48:35,075
- I'm well, thank you.
- Here for the clambake?

887
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:37,077
No, I'm just here to pick up
some things from the boat.

888
00:48:37,101 --> 00:48:40,038
I actually... I can't have
anything. I'm allergic to shellfish.

889
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,405
Are you?
Good to see you, Marv.

890
00:48:41,538 --> 00:48:43,941
But I can have corn...
Okay, bye. Thank you.

891
00:48:48,913 --> 00:48:52,050
I'm allergic to shellfish, so I
can't really have... Yeah, no.

892
00:48:52,182 --> 00:48:53,650
Okay. Well, see you.

893
00:48:53,785 --> 00:48:56,420
Come on in, Jack.
Save me some corn.

894
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,023
And potato salad.
That's all I can eat.

895
00:49:49,207 --> 00:49:51,408
Sorry. It's just me, Ronald.

896
00:49:51,541 --> 00:49:53,911
- Everything's okay.
- Hey, Ron.

897
00:50:07,724 --> 00:50:10,895
Actually, you can hide,
but I will find you.

898
00:50:27,011 --> 00:50:28,745
Thank you.

899
00:50:44,361 --> 00:50:46,596
<i>Thank you so much.
We're The Hot Sardines.</i>

900
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:48,933
<i>Wow,
what a perfectly beautiful day.</i>

901
00:50:49,066 --> 00:50:53,470
<i>The twin smells of the ocean and
money carried on the summer breeze.</i>

902
00:50:53,603 --> 00:50:56,373
<i>Here's one we call "Meet
Me at the Bottom of the Bottle."</i>

903
00:50:56,506 --> 00:50:58,242
<i>It's about drinking.</i>

904
00:50:58,375 --> 00:51:00,220
<i>Something perhaps some of
you might know something about.</i>

905
00:51:00,244 --> 00:51:02,412
You have, uh,
permission to board?

906
00:51:03,781 --> 00:51:06,349
I do. Uh, in fact, the owner
of the boat just texted me

907
00:51:06,483 --> 00:51:08,518
and asked if I could check.

908
00:51:08,652 --> 00:51:10,654
He might have left something
on board.

909
00:51:11,189 --> 00:51:13,356
Uh-huh?
Yeah.

910
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:16,194
And what's the name
of the owner the boat?

911
00:51:16,326 --> 00:51:17,829
Oh, Ronald Ho ran.
Ah.

912
00:51:17,962 --> 00:51:20,240
Yeah, he said he might have
left his lesson plan on board.

913
00:51:20,264 --> 00:51:23,533
Did you know he's a
professor? No, shit.

914
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:27,305
Ronnie, uh... He brags
about it to everyone.

915
00:51:27,437 --> 00:51:28,471
Yeah.
What's your name?

916
00:51:28,605 --> 00:51:30,440
Uh, Sydney Blake.
Ah.

917
00:51:30,574 --> 00:51:31,809
I'm, uh, Kenton Alfred.

918
00:51:31,943 --> 00:51:35,179
I'm the commodore here
of the club.

919
00:51:35,313 --> 00:51:40,684
Hey, your old man isn't
Jefferson Blake, is he?

920
00:51:41,418 --> 00:51:42,452
My uncle.

921
00:51:42,586 --> 00:51:44,588
Ah!
Yeah. That's...

922
00:51:44,721 --> 00:51:48,125
Well, your uncle and I
got into a little mischief...

923
00:51:48,259 --> 00:51:49,794
Oh.
...back at Exeter.

924
00:51:49,927 --> 00:51:53,663
We once stole a homecoming float

925
00:51:53,798 --> 00:51:58,635
and... and crashed it
right into a goal post.

926
00:51:58,769 --> 00:52:02,039
- We were a little, uh, stewed.
- Oh, yeah. Sure, sure.

927
00:52:02,173 --> 00:52:04,350
Nothing like a little
consequence-free fun for the rich, huh?

928
00:52:04,374 --> 00:52:07,111
How is the old
the guy doing these days?

929
00:52:07,245 --> 00:52:10,747
Oh, you didn't hear?
No, uh... We lost uncle Jeff.

930
00:52:10,882 --> 00:52:14,451
No, no. I'm
sorry, what happened?

931
00:52:14,584 --> 00:52:17,855
Yeah, he swam right into
a... a boat propeller. Yeah.

932
00:52:17,989 --> 00:52:18,990
Oh, no.
Yeah.

933
00:52:19,123 --> 00:52:21,125
Uh, just basically,
you know, pureed him.

934
00:52:21,259 --> 00:52:23,094
Oh, good Lord!
Just a mess.

935
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:25,317
He just looked like
sauce. It was not great.

936
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:26,341
Oh.

937
00:52:28,732 --> 00:52:32,435
Well, see you around.

938
00:52:47,118 --> 00:52:48,551
Mr. Fletcher.

939
00:52:50,021 --> 00:52:51,055
Morris.

940
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:53,623
Are you really an inspector?

941
00:52:53,758 --> 00:52:55,993
The mayor bestowed
that special rank on me

942
00:52:56,127 --> 00:52:59,096
after I solved the murder
of a city council woman.

943
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:03,834
She got stabbed multiple times
with an ice pick in her own bathtub.

944
00:53:04,634 --> 00:53:05,946
I mean, I guess if you work
in politics,

945
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:07,772
you probably do have to take
a lot of baths.

946
00:53:07,905 --> 00:53:11,441
We obtained surveillance footage
from a store around the corner.

947
00:53:11,574 --> 00:53:13,010
Where the fudge is made?

948
00:53:13,144 --> 00:53:16,080
And the footage shows Laurel
Goodwin walking with a man

949
00:53:16,213 --> 00:53:19,884
whose height and build
is very similar to yours.

950
00:53:20,017 --> 00:53:22,787
Well, that doesn't rule out
Tatianna or Eve,

951
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,990
or anybody really hiring
someone to do their dirty work.

952
00:53:26,123 --> 00:53:27,191
Did you see his face?

953
00:53:27,325 --> 00:53:30,161
He was wearing a purple hat
with a yellow logo.

954
00:53:31,461 --> 00:53:33,364
Exactly like
the one on your head.

955
00:53:33,496 --> 00:53:35,433
You fucking with me?
Come on.

956
00:53:35,565 --> 00:53:37,245
Be honest, Morris.
Are you fucking with me?

957
00:53:37,335 --> 00:53:41,205
Mr. Fletcher, when have you
ever known me to fuck with you?

958
00:53:48,645 --> 00:53:50,448
Okay. Well, I...
I see that, sure,

959
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:54,651
but it's probably a Minnesota
Vikings hat, you know?

960
00:53:55,453 --> 00:53:57,654
Any theories?
Yes.

961
00:53:58,322 --> 00:53:59,790
Irwin Maurice Fletcher,

962
00:53:59,924 --> 00:54:02,126
you're under arrest for the
murder of Laurel Goodwin.

963
00:54:02,259 --> 00:54:05,662
Come on now! That's...
You're not playing fair.

964
00:54:05,796 --> 00:54:07,999
Can you do me a favor?
Read me my rights in Italian.

965
00:54:08,132 --> 00:54:09,508
I've been working
really hard on it.

966
00:54:09,532 --> 00:54:11,302
Let's go.
Okay, ow.

967
00:54:13,603 --> 00:54:14,939
Andy, it's me.

968
00:54:15,072 --> 00:54:17,640
Oh, I'm glad you're awake.
Listen, I need...

969
00:54:19,176 --> 00:54:20,845
You're what?

970
00:54:20,978 --> 00:54:23,814
Oh. Well, in that case,
I'm really glad you're awake.

971
00:54:24,514 --> 00:54:26,917
Yes, what aren't you wearing?

972
00:54:28,285 --> 00:54:31,088
Oh, goodness. You woke
up in a very naughty mood.

973
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:34,392
What? No, I don't need
a reason to call you.

974
00:54:34,524 --> 00:54:38,728
I was just calling. I happen to be
calling you, you know, to hear your voice.

975
00:54:39,864 --> 00:54:43,666
And I need you
to bail me out of jail.

976
00:54:47,938 --> 00:54:50,908
Come on, Griz.
Is this about the bus?

977
00:54:51,574 --> 00:54:53,010
It was nothing personal.

978
00:54:55,612 --> 00:54:56,914
You're free to go.

979
00:54:57,815 --> 00:54:59,183
How can I make it up to you?

980
00:54:59,316 --> 00:55:00,751
Are you set for luggage?

981
00:55:01,786 --> 00:55:03,586
I'll let you take me to dinner?

982
00:55:04,922 --> 00:55:07,624
I'd rather throw myself
into Boston Harbor.

983
00:55:10,261 --> 00:55:11,295
Seems extreme.

984
00:55:14,465 --> 00:55:15,632
Go, Lakers.

985
00:55:19,569 --> 00:55:20,125
Hey.

986
00:55:20,149 --> 00:55:21,869
<i>I got that
police report you wanted.</i>

987
00:55:21,972 --> 00:55:23,740
<i>I just emailed it to you.
It's encrypted.</i>

988
00:55:23,874 --> 00:55:26,877
- Oh, good. Uh, what's the password?
<i>- Go fuck yourself.</i>

989
00:55:27,011 --> 00:55:29,046
Frank, don't be an asshole.

990
00:55:36,554 --> 00:55:38,588
Okay.

991
00:55:52,602 --> 00:55:57,374
Fletch, how dare you
abandon me at the hotel yesterday?

992
00:55:57,508 --> 00:56:01,711
The Countess de Grassi has
never been left alone at the table.

993
00:56:01,846 --> 00:56:03,491
Countess, what are you doing?

994
00:56:03,515 --> 00:56:06,417
Ah, you were right.
The hotel is too expensive.

995
00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:09,587
I can't get Menti's money.

996
00:56:09,719 --> 00:56:12,289
Everything is all freezed.

997
00:56:12,423 --> 00:56:14,225
Uh, why did you come here?

998
00:56:14,358 --> 00:56:18,262
Why should the Countess de
Grassi stay in a too expensive hotel

999
00:56:18,395 --> 00:56:21,532
when her almost son is here

1000
00:56:21,664 --> 00:56:25,503
in this nice big townhouse

1001
00:56:25,635 --> 00:56:26,675
near very good shopping...

1002
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:27,972
You can't stay here.

1003
00:56:28,105 --> 00:56:30,241
What would poor dead Menti say

1004
00:56:30,374 --> 00:56:34,311
if he know the Countess
is in some fleabag hotel?

1005
00:56:34,445 --> 00:56:35,678
Hmm?

1006
00:56:35,813 --> 00:56:37,281
No. No happy.

1007
00:56:37,414 --> 00:56:41,619
Now, Fletch, where is my
room? I'm sorry. I...

1008
00:56:41,752 --> 00:56:44,255
You know, I came here to work.
You're just gonna be in the way.

1009
00:56:44,388 --> 00:56:46,590
Oh, you bet your big cock
I'm going to be in the way.

1010
00:56:46,723 --> 00:56:48,826
I am going
to keep an eye on you.

1011
00:56:48,959 --> 00:56:50,628
Okay, you can stay one night,

1012
00:56:50,761 --> 00:56:53,006
and then we're gonna look for
a nice mid-range hotel for you.

1013
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:55,732
What is this "mid-range"?

1014
00:56:55,866 --> 00:56:58,102
Now come, Fletch. Come. Sit.

1015
00:56:59,069 --> 00:57:02,640
I now show you what I
want to show you at the hotel

1016
00:57:02,773 --> 00:57:04,975
when you leave me
with <i>il con to.</i>

1017
00:57:05,109 --> 00:57:07,111
I found this at the villa.

1018
00:57:07,744 --> 00:57:10,981
Photos. Angela's photos.
Hmm.

1019
00:57:11,882 --> 00:57:14,985
Did you know Angela
went to university

1020
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,521
here in Boston for a year?

1021
00:57:17,655 --> 00:57:19,089
No, it never came up.

1022
00:57:19,823 --> 00:57:22,493
Hmm.
Do you know who that is?

1023
00:57:22,626 --> 00:57:24,094
Turn it over.

1024
00:57:24,228 --> 00:57:27,730
Owen Tasserly.
Did you know they were friends?

1025
00:57:27,865 --> 00:57:30,000
She might have mentioned it.
Oh.

1026
00:57:30,134 --> 00:57:31,769
Andy made all the arrangements.

1027
00:57:31,902 --> 00:57:34,805
Fletch, listen to the Contessa.

1028
00:57:34,939 --> 00:57:38,876
Angela cannot be trusted.
Why is she not here?

1029
00:57:39,009 --> 00:57:40,878
She's trying to find
her father, your husband.

1030
00:57:41,011 --> 00:57:44,014
Oh, Fletch. Fletch.

1031
00:57:44,148 --> 00:57:46,749
I know this is
so bad news for you.

1032
00:57:46,884 --> 00:57:48,619
Now, where is the shower?

1033
00:57:48,752 --> 00:57:49,920
You want to take a shower?

1034
00:57:50,054 --> 00:57:53,290
No, I want you to take a shower.
You stink.

1035
00:57:53,424 --> 00:57:54,858
I make drinks.

1036
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,071
Countess, do you mind?

1037
00:58:02,132 --> 00:58:05,169
Fletch, I found
a dead fish in your tank.

1038
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:10,207
Okay, well,
we'll light a candle for it.

1039
00:58:10,341 --> 00:58:15,312
- Now, could you please...
- Oh, Fletch, I am so sad.

1040
00:58:15,446 --> 00:58:17,147
My Menti is dead.

1041
00:58:17,281 --> 00:58:20,551
My <i>chiromante</i> tell me the
kidnappers have killed him.

1042
00:58:20,684 --> 00:58:24,088
Where did all your clothes go?
What is the <i>chiromante?</i>

1043
00:58:24,221 --> 00:58:28,759
How do you say?
Uh, is a fortune teller.

1044
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:33,430
She tell me they take my
Menti, they put him in a coffin,

1045
00:58:33,564 --> 00:58:36,400
they fill it with cats,
and they bury him alive.

1046
00:58:36,533 --> 00:58:38,869
Is horrible, no? Well, it
sounds very implausible.

1047
00:58:39,003 --> 00:58:41,305
Fletch, is no time
for a wisecrack.

1048
00:58:41,438 --> 00:58:42,740
My Menti is allergic.

1049
00:58:42,873 --> 00:58:44,642
Now, shall I make us negronis?

1050
00:58:44,808 --> 00:58:46,310
Sure.
Okay.

1051
00:58:46,443 --> 00:58:48,912
Go buy gin, vermouth,
Campari and oranges.

1052
00:58:49,046 --> 00:58:51,749
Can I please have
the bathroom to myself?

1053
00:58:51,882 --> 00:58:55,019
Fletch,
you parade around me naked,

1054
00:58:55,152 --> 00:58:56,592
but I am not going
to sleep with you.

1055
00:58:56,654 --> 00:58:57,721
You came in here.

1056
00:58:57,855 --> 00:58:59,256
Please do not put
too much vermouth

1057
00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:00,491
in my Negroni.

1058
00:59:00,624 --> 00:59:01,859
Hurry up.

1059
00:59:17,107 --> 00:59:18,876
<i>I got eyes on Fletcher.</i>

1060
00:59:19,009 --> 00:59:22,079
<i>In the alleyway, headed towards
your end of the street. Over.</i>

1061
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:24,548
Copy that. Roger.

1062
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:28,152
Oh, no! Oh, no!

1063
00:59:40,064 --> 00:59:42,499
- You Irwin?
- Call me Fletch.

1064
01:00:04,922 --> 01:00:08,793
Really quite
extraordinary. Yes, it is.

1065
01:00:08,926 --> 01:00:13,263
He's asking 25 million.
My advice is to counter at 20.

1066
01:00:14,732 --> 01:00:17,368
Well, okay.
Make that counter.

1067
01:00:17,901 --> 01:00:19,236
Fantastic.

1068
01:00:24,675 --> 01:00:26,210
Hey, uh, excuse me,

1069
01:00:26,343 --> 01:00:28,847
do you happen to know where I
can maybe buy some fireworks?

1070
01:00:28,979 --> 01:00:30,681
Yeah, New Hampshire.

1071
01:00:30,815 --> 01:00:33,226
<i>Where are
you, Fletch? I called a few times.</i>

1072
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:36,553
<i>My lawyer told me that the fucking
Countess has gone to Boston.</i>

1073
01:00:37,154 --> 01:00:38,555
<i>Has she tried to contact you?</i>

1074
01:00:39,623 --> 01:00:43,494
<i>I'm coming to Boston tomorrow.
My flight arrives at 5:32 p.m.</i>

1075
01:00:43,627 --> 01:00:46,865
<i>Can you pick me up?
I miss you.</i>

1076
01:00:46,997 --> 01:00:48,599
Ciao, a more.

1077
01:01:46,089 --> 01:01:47,324
What the...

1078
01:01:48,692 --> 01:01:50,427
The fuck?

1079
01:02:23,627 --> 01:02:26,764
It was the teenagers.
They were drinking.

1080
01:02:26,898 --> 01:02:28,465
So sorry about your window.

1081
01:02:28,599 --> 01:02:30,334
This boat is private property.

1082
01:02:30,467 --> 01:02:31,323
Yeah, I know.

1083
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:33,938
No one is allowed on but me.

1084
01:02:34,071 --> 01:02:35,816
And I am bringing in
my own private security.

1085
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:38,843
Oh, hey. I know the guys
who used to guard Peter Wolf.

1086
01:02:38,977 --> 01:02:40,110
Shit.

1087
01:02:40,244 --> 01:02:41,822
- The J. Geils Band?
- No.

1088
01:02:41,846 --> 01:02:44,949
My security team will be here
within the hour. Thank you.

1089
01:02:45,082 --> 01:02:47,084
Come on.
Angel is a centerfold?

1090
01:02:47,217 --> 01:02:51,021
I don't know what
that is and I hope that I never do.

1091
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:58,462
How long have you guys
done security?

1092
01:02:58,997 --> 01:03:00,230
About eight years.

1093
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:17,581
I've never felt the need
to have a gun,

1094
01:03:17,714 --> 01:03:19,784
because I have sort of
an inner calm.

1095
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,188
Oh, for...
Let's go check that out.

1096
01:03:25,322 --> 01:03:26,958
Let's go.

1097
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:30,727
- Uh, I'm coming. I'll...
- Sorry. I'll help.

1098
01:03:30,862 --> 01:03:34,364
Pretty dark, so be careful,
guys. It's really dark.

1099
01:03:34,498 --> 01:03:36,700
- Okay, Marv.
- Thanks, bud.

1100
01:04:27,484 --> 01:04:29,686
It's just
those same inebriated kids.

1101
01:04:29,821 --> 01:04:33,724
Probably just doing pranks, and,
you know, just trying to get hits online.

1102
01:04:33,858 --> 01:04:34,959
Trying to go viral.

1103
01:04:35,093 --> 01:04:36,761
I've been doing this 21 years.

1104
01:04:36,894 --> 01:04:40,263
When I, uh... When I was 17,
I stopped a burglary at Caldor,

1105
01:04:40,397 --> 01:04:43,901
and I kind of was like, "You
know, I think this is the thing for me."

1106
01:04:44,035 --> 01:04:45,569
I... I tripped the guy,
but still.

1107
01:04:45,702 --> 01:04:50,875
Hey, you guys like J. Geils?
"Freeze-Frame"? "Love Stinks"?

1108
01:04:51,009 --> 01:04:52,743
I think Horan's
never even heard of them.

1109
01:04:52,877 --> 01:04:54,677
I mean, I get you don't know
"Whammer Jammer".

1110
01:04:54,779 --> 01:04:56,546
First record.
Who's gonna hear that?

1111
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:59,549
Harmonic instrumental.
I mean, whoa.

1112
01:05:00,051 --> 01:05:01,652
But "Centerfold"?

1113
01:05:11,062 --> 01:05:12,562
You really need
to get some sleep.

1114
01:05:12,696 --> 01:05:17,167
Oh, my God.
No, I don't, actually.

1115
01:05:21,672 --> 01:05:24,842
Fletch, I told you
I not sleep with you.

1116
01:05:24,976 --> 01:05:29,881
Countess, this is my bed. There
are three other rooms.

1117
01:05:30,014 --> 01:05:31,481
Have you found my paintings?

1118
01:05:31,615 --> 01:05:33,259
I wasn't looking for your...
For the... for the paintings.

1119
01:05:33,283 --> 01:05:36,319
I think the wicked
Angela has you under a spell.

1120
01:05:36,453 --> 01:05:40,058
For your information,
I'm crazy about Angela.

1121
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:42,760
I'm actually thinking of
asking her to marry me. Oh, no.

1122
01:05:42,894 --> 01:05:44,996
Don't waste
your third marriage on her.

1123
01:05:45,129 --> 01:05:50,200
Menti was my third marriage,
and, oh, he was my best one yet.

1124
01:05:50,333 --> 01:05:52,712
You know, I wish you and Angela
could get to know one another.

1125
01:05:52,736 --> 01:05:54,237
I think
you would actually be friends.

1126
01:05:54,371 --> 01:05:56,306
She hate the Countess.

1127
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,709
I think she just doesn't
know the Countess.

1128
01:05:58,843 --> 01:06:02,180
Fletch,
are you trying to seduce me?

1129
01:06:02,312 --> 01:06:04,411
That is not at all what's
happening right now.

1130
01:06:04,435 --> 01:06:05,549
Okay, Fletch. Okay.

1131
01:06:05,682 --> 01:06:07,785
- Maybe only this once. Come. Come.
- Okay.

1132
01:06:07,919 --> 01:06:10,287
I'm gonna go
to one of the spare rooms.

1133
01:06:12,322 --> 01:06:15,459
Hmm. Bravo, Fletch.
Bravo, bravo.

1134
01:06:15,592 --> 01:06:20,031
You have passed my test.
Now you can be my son-in-law.

1135
01:06:20,164 --> 01:06:23,633
It's a
nice big hairy chest, I see.

1136
01:06:23,768 --> 01:06:26,570
You have a nice chest,
Fletch. Thank you.

1137
01:06:30,141 --> 01:06:31,909
Morris! Morris! Morris!

1138
01:06:32,043 --> 01:06:33,510
Jesus, Griz.
Sorry.

1139
01:06:33,643 --> 01:06:35,179
Oh, my God.
I have something for you.

1140
01:06:35,312 --> 01:06:37,590
There was an incident last
night at the Mayflower Yacht Club

1141
01:06:37,614 --> 01:06:39,559
and these kids, they were
shooting out some fireworks.

1142
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:42,519
And I think that they went
astray onto this one yacht.

1143
01:06:42,987 --> 01:06:43,988
Yeah?

1144
01:06:44,822 --> 01:06:47,491
The yacht belongs
to Ronald Ho ran.

1145
01:06:49,693 --> 01:06:51,996
We found Fletcher parked
in front of the Ho ran Gallery.

1146
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:53,497
Right.
So do you think that...

1147
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:56,968
This stupid idiot moron
has something to do with this.

1148
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:58,400
Fuck, yes.

1149
01:06:58,502 --> 01:07:00,004
Yeah. Fuck yeah! Fuck yeah!

1150
01:07:00,138 --> 01:07:01,571
Ow! Oh, ow.

1151
01:07:02,405 --> 01:07:04,842
Well, he told me
his name was Ralph Locke.

1152
01:07:04,976 --> 01:07:06,878
And that's why
I wanted to see you.

1153
01:07:07,011 --> 01:07:09,080
Be very careful doing business
with Mr. Fletcher.

1154
01:07:09,213 --> 01:07:12,049
Thank you, Inspector.
I appreciate that very much.

1155
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:28,331
I missed you, Fletch. Mmm.
Oh.

1156
01:07:28,465 --> 01:07:30,600
I missed you, too.
I missed you so much.

1157
01:07:30,734 --> 01:07:31,735
Mmm.

1158
01:07:34,538 --> 01:07:36,007
Okay. Okay. Sure.

1159
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:39,056
So, has the Countess
tried to contact you?

1160
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,080
Yes.

1161
01:07:40,178 --> 01:07:42,246
Shit. What is she up to?

1162
01:07:42,379 --> 01:07:44,248
Well, spying on me.

1163
01:07:44,381 --> 01:07:46,483
Where is she staying?

1164
01:07:46,616 --> 01:07:48,820
At the townhouse with me.

1165
01:07:49,419 --> 01:07:50,554
Are you kidding me?

1166
01:07:50,687 --> 01:07:52,223
How could you let her
stay with you?

1167
01:07:52,355 --> 01:07:55,092
She showed up with suitcases.
I can't get her to leave.

1168
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:57,161
Did you have sex with her?

1169
01:07:57,295 --> 01:07:58,728
No. I slept in the other room.

1170
01:07:59,462 --> 01:08:00,765
I don't believe you.

1171
01:08:01,631 --> 01:08:03,277
Andy, why did you lie to me
about Tasserly?

1172
01:08:03,301 --> 01:08:05,002
What?
What are you talking about?

1173
01:08:05,136 --> 01:08:08,072
You didn't tell me you did
a year of college in Boston

1174
01:08:08,206 --> 01:08:09,974
and that you knew Owen Tasserly.

1175
01:08:10,107 --> 01:08:11,541
Of course I did.
No.

1176
01:08:11,675 --> 01:08:14,578
You said you got the townhouse
off a luxury rental website.

1177
01:08:14,711 --> 01:08:16,746
Fletch,
you're becoming paranoid.

1178
01:08:16,881 --> 01:08:19,397
Listen, I think Owen
Tasserly killed Laurel Goodwin.

1179
01:08:20,383 --> 01:08:22,503
He was arrested for bonking
his neighbor over the head

1180
01:08:22,586 --> 01:08:24,106
with a very heavy object.
He's violent.

1181
01:08:24,155 --> 01:08:26,389
He could have easily bonked
Laurel over the head too.

1182
01:08:26,523 --> 01:08:28,759
Owen's not a serial "bonker".

1183
01:08:28,893 --> 01:08:30,828
Well, look, he's going through
a hellish divorce.

1184
01:08:30,962 --> 01:08:33,030
He's abusing drugs.
He's... He's a mess.

1185
01:08:33,164 --> 01:08:34,232
Yeah.

1186
01:08:34,364 --> 01:08:36,533
He told me all about that.
<i>Poverino.</i>

1187
01:08:36,666 --> 01:08:39,003
- What? You talk to him?
- Yes, we talk.

1188
01:08:39,136 --> 01:08:40,403
He's an old friend.

1189
01:08:40,537 --> 01:08:43,007
Does Owen know any
martial arts? What? No.

1190
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:45,076
- Does he have a beard now?
- How should I know?

1191
01:08:45,209 --> 01:08:46,889
You just said you talk to him
all the time.

1192
01:08:46,978 --> 01:08:48,813
You can't hear a beard
over the phone.

1193
01:08:48,946 --> 01:08:51,258
I don't know. Maybe you Face
time or send each other texts.

1194
01:08:51,282 --> 01:08:53,284
I just got off a very
long flight. I'm very tired.

1195
01:08:53,416 --> 01:08:54,988
You're attacking me
with all these questions.

1196
01:08:55,012 --> 01:08:55,528
Okay.

1197
01:08:55,552 --> 01:08:58,155
Okay. I'm sorry.

1198
01:09:04,295 --> 01:09:06,396
<i>Grazie.</i>

1199
01:09:06,529 --> 01:09:09,967
- Angela!
- Sylvia!

1200
01:09:18,943 --> 01:09:20,543
Fletch,
we're gonna cook you dinner.

1201
01:09:39,063 --> 01:09:40,497
Okay, listen to this.

1202
01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:42,465
Our Ronald Ho ran
is under investigation

1203
01:09:42,599 --> 01:09:44,634
for a possible
false insurance claim

1204
01:09:44,769 --> 01:09:46,009
about a robbery at his gallery.

1205
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:47,604
What is Irwin up to
with this guy?

1206
01:09:47,737 --> 01:09:50,174
Also, you asked me to search
the Italian papers.

1207
01:09:50,308 --> 01:09:51,809
Check that out.

1208
01:09:53,177 --> 01:09:54,211
What's it say?

1209
01:09:56,579 --> 01:09:58,448
Oh, in English.

1210
01:09:58,581 --> 01:10:02,053
Fletcher's at a press conference about
a kidnapping of the Count de Grassi,

1211
01:10:02,186 --> 01:10:04,088
father of Angela de Grassi.

1212
01:10:04,487 --> 01:10:05,790
Andy Angela.

1213
01:10:05,923 --> 01:10:07,901
And the kidnappers are demanding
a Picasso painting

1214
01:10:07,925 --> 01:10:09,427
from the Count's collection
as ransom.

1215
01:10:09,559 --> 01:10:12,296
But Angela's saying
that the painting's been stolen.

1216
01:10:12,430 --> 01:10:13,864
Hmm.

1217
01:10:13,998 --> 01:10:16,000
So, are we gonna
bring Fletcher in?

1218
01:10:18,535 --> 01:10:21,172
Not yet. Keep looking.

1219
01:10:21,872 --> 01:10:22,907
Okay.

1220
01:10:30,613 --> 01:10:32,249
Wait a minute.

1221
01:10:38,155 --> 01:10:41,092
Just like family, we are
together. Mmm.

1222
01:10:41,225 --> 01:10:42,460
If only Menti were here.

1223
01:10:42,592 --> 01:10:44,195
Dear papa.

1224
01:10:46,797 --> 01:10:49,000
<i>Oh, grazie.</i>
Mm-hmm.

1225
01:10:49,133 --> 01:10:51,936
Mmm. I'll get it.

1226
01:10:52,069 --> 01:10:54,071
Who is it?
No one you know.

1227
01:10:54,205 --> 01:10:57,074
- Is it someone I know?
- Fletch, set another place.

1228
01:11:00,643 --> 01:11:02,146
- Owen!
- Angela.

1229
01:11:02,279 --> 01:11:04,982
Come into your
own house. <i>Ciao, a more.</i>

1230
01:11:07,650 --> 01:11:10,221
This is my boyfriend
who's been staying here.

1231
01:11:10,755 --> 01:11:13,590
And Sylvia, my stepmother.

1232
01:11:13,723 --> 01:11:17,194
I know. I know. We
look like <i>sorelle.</i> Sisters.

1233
01:11:17,328 --> 01:11:18,561
Uh-huh.

1234
01:11:19,696 --> 01:11:22,137
Quite an art collection
you have, Mr. Tasserly.

1235
01:11:22,161 --> 01:11:23,161
Thank you.

1236
01:11:23,934 --> 01:11:26,470
- That my shirt?
- No. Maybe.

1237
01:11:26,603 --> 01:11:31,342
- Owen, you are an art dealer, no?
- I'm an art broker.

1238
01:11:31,475 --> 01:11:34,912
- You study any martial arts by any chance?
- Muay Thai.

1239
01:11:35,846 --> 01:11:37,348
Muay Thai.

1240
01:11:37,481 --> 01:11:40,317
Look, I owe you a big
apology about the other night.

1241
01:11:40,451 --> 01:11:42,019
What? What happened?

1242
01:11:42,153 --> 01:11:45,456
I let myself in because I
needed something urgently.

1243
01:11:45,588 --> 01:11:49,126
I honestly assumed nobody would be
staying here after there was a murder.

1244
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:53,197
I didn't know it was you,
or I wouldn't have done that.

1245
01:11:53,330 --> 01:11:56,067
- What did you do?
- Oh, he kicked my ass.

1246
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:56,967
Uh...

1247
01:11:57,101 --> 01:11:58,869
What did you need so urgently?

1248
01:11:59,503 --> 01:12:01,138
Some medication.

1249
01:12:01,272 --> 01:12:03,673
Medication? For what?

1250
01:12:03,808 --> 01:12:09,947
Um... It's a rare disorder.
Segegenisis.

1251
01:12:10,081 --> 01:12:12,283
It's... It's...
It's a stom... stomach thing.

1252
01:12:12,416 --> 01:12:15,152
It's a... You get it
from eating too much...

1253
01:12:17,121 --> 01:12:18,155
porridge.

1254
01:12:19,123 --> 01:12:21,325
Owen, come on.
Tell us the truth.

1255
01:12:21,459 --> 01:12:24,995
Fine. I snuck in to get a bottle
of Oxy I had in the drawer.

1256
01:12:25,129 --> 01:12:26,497
Oh.

1257
01:12:26,629 --> 01:12:30,468
I flew back from Paris early
because I know I need to get help.

1258
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:31,668
But I was weak, okay?

1259
01:12:31,802 --> 01:12:34,405
Did you come here tonight
to see me

1260
01:12:34,538 --> 01:12:36,006
or to look for more Oxy?

1261
01:12:38,776 --> 01:12:40,177
Can't it be both?

1262
01:12:40,311 --> 01:12:42,780
<i>Ay.</i>
Owen, you're going to rehab.

1263
01:12:42,913 --> 01:12:44,982
Anything else you want
to tell us about, Owen?

1264
01:12:45,116 --> 01:12:47,251
- Where are my paintings?
- What is she talking about?

1265
01:12:47,384 --> 01:12:48,786
Is the Picasso here?

1266
01:12:48,919 --> 01:12:50,154
- Sylvia.
- What?

1267
01:12:50,287 --> 01:12:51,697
- Come on, you're being ridiculous.
- No.

1268
01:12:51,721 --> 01:12:53,757
Owen knows nothing
about the paintings

1269
01:12:53,891 --> 01:12:56,961
that you and your
criminal brothers stole.

1270
01:12:58,896 --> 01:13:00,297
There it is.

1271
01:13:03,501 --> 01:13:05,803
Ladies. Ladies.

1272
01:13:07,805 --> 01:13:12,009
Ah, Rothko.
Oh, Lee Krasner. Miró...

1273
01:13:16,313 --> 01:13:17,348
Ladies.

1274
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,922
- Ladies.
- Where's Frida Kahlo?

1275
01:13:26,056 --> 01:13:28,492
Owen,
who are these loud Italians?

1276
01:13:29,827 --> 01:13:31,595
Tatiana, thanks for coming.

1277
01:13:31,728 --> 01:13:32,728
Oh, shit.

1278
01:13:32,796 --> 01:13:36,300
What? Frank!

1279
01:13:36,433 --> 01:13:37,734
Frank? That's Ralph.

1280
01:13:37,868 --> 01:13:39,346
He's the guy
who's been renting my place.

1281
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:41,114
He told me he's Frank Jaffe
from the <i>Sentinel.</i>

1282
01:13:41,138 --> 01:13:43,207
Then he came over
and interviewed me.

1283
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:45,142
- So there is an explanation.
- Uh-huh.

1284
01:13:45,276 --> 01:13:47,756
You came over to my wife's house
pretending to be a journalist?

1285
01:13:47,845 --> 01:13:50,080
Well, I was a reporter
of some repute.

1286
01:13:50,214 --> 01:13:52,325
- What are you playing at, bro?
- What is going on here?

1287
01:13:52,349 --> 01:13:53,989
Okay. A lot of balls
in the air right now.

1288
01:13:54,051 --> 01:13:56,287
- Fletch, what did you do now?
- He killed Frida Kahlo.

1289
01:13:56,420 --> 01:13:57,788
I knew you were a phony.

1290
01:13:58,255 --> 01:13:59,356
A style editor?

1291
01:13:59,490 --> 01:14:01,192
He doesn't even know
what bespoke means.

1292
01:14:01,325 --> 01:14:02,993
Doesn't even know what
bespoke... The fuck, dude!

1293
01:14:03,017 --> 01:14:03,565
No.

1294
01:14:03,693 --> 01:14:05,296
You better be able
to explain yourself.

1295
01:14:05,429 --> 01:14:07,374
Okay. Well, it's not a short explain...

1296
01:14:07,398 --> 01:14:08,432
Jesus! Fuck!

1297
01:14:08,566 --> 01:14:10,267
All right. You have
got to stop hitting me!

1298
01:14:10,401 --> 01:14:12,481
I'm calling the cops
on this piece of shit right now.

1299
01:14:12,536 --> 01:14:15,906
Call the cops. Please. Ask for Inspector
Morris Monroe. He's a smart guy.

1300
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:18,280
- You can use my name.
- Which one? Fletch? Frank? Ralph?

1301
01:14:18,342 --> 01:14:20,878
- Owen, stop! Stop! Everybody calm down!
- Ow.

1302
01:14:21,011 --> 01:14:22,146
Hey, hey, <i>basta.</i>

1303
01:14:22,279 --> 01:14:24,281
You! Yes.

1304
01:14:24,415 --> 01:14:26,417
Put your phone down. Yes.

1305
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:29,086
Let's all take
a breath. Listen to me.

1306
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:32,489
Fletch has been investigating
the murder.

1307
01:14:32,623 --> 01:14:37,361
I'm sure that's why
he was at your house, Tatiana.

1308
01:14:37,494 --> 01:14:40,097
Oh, wow. What smells so good?

1309
01:14:40,231 --> 01:14:42,533
Wow. Are you guys doing a seder?

1310
01:14:42,666 --> 01:14:43,834
Eve, you're here.

1311
01:14:43,968 --> 01:14:45,345
- Who is this?
- Of course you're here.

1312
01:14:45,369 --> 01:14:48,272
Why are you here? And who is this?

1313
01:14:48,405 --> 01:14:49,640
I don't know.

1314
01:14:49,773 --> 01:14:51,909
We met on the street. He
asked to come up and see you.

1315
01:14:52,042 --> 01:14:53,911
- I let him in.
- Cool.

1316
01:14:54,044 --> 01:14:55,279
Are you Irwin Fletcher?

1317
01:14:55,412 --> 01:14:56,814
Yes, I am.

1318
01:14:58,449 --> 01:14:59,516
Whoa!

1319
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:01,752
I mean, no, I'm not.
I always get that wrong.

1320
01:15:01,885 --> 01:15:03,554
My name is Bart Robinson.

1321
01:15:04,455 --> 01:15:06,490
I was engaged
to marry Laurel Goodwin.

1322
01:15:08,092 --> 01:15:09,960
Okay. Hey, buddy.
No one's getting shot today.

1323
01:15:10,094 --> 01:15:11,762
Let's get you sobered up, huh?

1324
01:15:11,895 --> 01:15:14,040
- Get some coffee in you. This is Sylvia.
- Please. You come to Sylvia.

1325
01:15:14,064 --> 01:15:16,509
- She's gonna get you some nice food.
- I'll make you a plate of food.

1326
01:15:16,533 --> 01:15:18,411
- We'll be okay.
- What kind of food?

1327
01:15:18,435 --> 01:15:20,938
Get you a bite to eat.
We're gonna take care of ya.

1328
01:15:21,071 --> 01:15:24,141
What is that?
Owen, is that Oxy?

1329
01:15:24,275 --> 01:15:25,976
I have a prescription.
Right now? Really?

1330
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:29,580
Owen, I told you. Booze
and pills, it's a bad road.

1331
01:15:29,713 --> 01:15:32,283
- People love you, Owen.
- Oh, Eve.

1332
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:35,786
- Oh!
- Owen!

1333
01:15:35,919 --> 01:15:37,688
Owen, you didn't sign
the fucking paper!

1334
01:15:39,323 --> 01:15:41,243
That dog is
make <i>pipí</i> on the carpet.

1335
01:15:41,358 --> 01:15:44,628
Oh, yeah. She's hungry.

1336
01:15:47,998 --> 01:15:51,035
Um, I have to go.

1337
01:15:51,168 --> 01:15:53,237
- Wait, what? Why?
- Ah, <i>bravo.</i>

1338
01:15:53,370 --> 01:15:56,674
Fletch, this is something
I need to do right now.

1339
01:15:56,807 --> 01:15:58,208
And I will not
be cross-examined.

1340
01:15:58,342 --> 01:15:59,743
- Let it out, buddy.
- Yes.

1341
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:01,945
Let it out. Let it out.

1342
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:03,814
You are being impossible.

1343
01:16:03,947 --> 01:16:05,616
This is delicious.

1344
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:08,952
Are you really not gonna
tell me anything?

1345
01:16:10,354 --> 01:16:13,157
Andy, don't do this.
You're on thin ice, Fletch.

1346
01:16:13,891 --> 01:16:15,192
Angela, right?

1347
01:16:15,626 --> 01:16:16,894
I'm on thin ice?

1348
01:17:51,756 --> 01:17:53,357
God.

1349
01:17:56,326 --> 01:17:58,362
Mr. Ho ran, lovely to see you.

1350
01:17:58,495 --> 01:18:00,397
So, uh... It's last call
at the clubhouse.

1351
01:18:00,531 --> 01:18:02,909
Oh, well. Better hurry. Yeah,
you gotta... better get in there.

1352
01:18:02,933 --> 01:18:04,790
You know, if they're
closed, there's... must

1353
01:18:04,814 --> 01:18:06,670
be Scuppers...
Cheers. Thank you.

1354
01:18:46,811 --> 01:18:48,445
- Hey, Commodore.
- Hey, Ron.

1355
01:19:00,357 --> 01:19:01,793
Shit.

1356
01:19:01,926 --> 01:19:04,495
You still haven't
explained why you were avoiding me.

1357
01:19:04,628 --> 01:19:08,398
I was not avoiding you.
I was trying to protect you.

1358
01:19:08,532 --> 01:19:10,267
You lie some fucking bullshit!

1359
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:11,960
Do you really expect me
to believe that?

1360
01:19:12,002 --> 01:19:15,105
Angela, I told you.
I am under investigation.

1361
01:19:15,239 --> 01:19:18,175
People are watching
my every move.

1362
01:19:18,308 --> 01:19:20,043
Oh, come on, Ronald!

1363
01:19:20,177 --> 01:19:24,314
You could have found a way to let
me know you sold two of my paintings!

1364
01:19:26,316 --> 01:19:28,652
- Oops.
- What on earth is...

1365
01:19:29,754 --> 01:19:31,488
Mr. Locke.

1366
01:19:32,222 --> 01:19:34,191
Fletch?
Hi.

1367
01:19:34,324 --> 01:19:35,692
What are you doing here?

1368
01:19:35,827 --> 01:19:38,228
You know, I was worried.
I'm a... I'm a worrier.

1369
01:19:38,362 --> 01:19:41,231
You don't need to worry.
The paintings are here.

1370
01:19:41,365 --> 01:19:42,366
We can save Menti.

1371
01:19:42,499 --> 01:19:44,501
Come on. You're like a wet dog.

1372
01:19:45,803 --> 01:19:47,271
Stupid shoes.

1373
01:19:47,404 --> 01:19:49,406
<i>Ronald was my professor
in Harvard.</i>

1374
01:19:49,908 --> 01:19:51,341
He was also my lover.

1375
01:19:52,944 --> 01:19:54,755
Okay. You know what?
Don't look so proud.

1376
01:19:54,779 --> 01:19:56,699
She doesn't have the best record
at picking guys.

1377
01:19:56,814 --> 01:20:00,018
So, you stole the paintings
and gave them to him to sell?

1378
01:20:00,150 --> 01:20:01,385
They're rightfully mine.

1379
01:20:01,953 --> 01:20:03,186
But before I met you,

1380
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:05,160
Ronald stopped returning
my calls or my emails.

1381
01:20:05,188 --> 01:20:08,258
So I was surprised when you
told me he had sold two paintings.

1382
01:20:08,392 --> 01:20:10,527
I always intended
to keep my bargain with you.

1383
01:20:10,661 --> 01:20:13,630
I was just very concerned
that I was being surveilled.

1384
01:20:13,765 --> 01:20:15,934
I'll take your word for it,
Ronald.

1385
01:20:16,066 --> 01:20:17,434
I did a little digging,
you know.

1386
01:20:17,568 --> 01:20:19,904
It would appear that
your father's art collection

1387
01:20:20,038 --> 01:20:22,139
was all looted
during World War Two.

1388
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:25,142
If they belong to anyone, it's
probably the Italian Republic.

1389
01:20:25,275 --> 01:20:27,511
Okay, wait.
Was Owen Tasserly in your class?

1390
01:20:27,644 --> 01:20:29,580
Yes.
We were both in Ronald's class.

1391
01:20:29,713 --> 01:20:31,049
Why does that matter?

1392
01:20:31,181 --> 01:20:33,684
What is your obsession
with Owen Tasserly?

1393
01:20:33,818 --> 01:20:36,653
You lied to me about Tasserly,
and I think I know why.

1394
01:20:36,788 --> 01:20:39,623
- What are you talking about?
- Owen goes to Europe all the time.

1395
01:20:39,757 --> 01:20:42,659
So he clearly helped you steal
the paintings from your father's villa.

1396
01:20:42,794 --> 01:20:45,362
Then Laurel Goodwin found out
and he killed her.

1397
01:20:45,495 --> 01:20:47,264
But instead of turning
Tasserly in for that,

1398
01:20:47,397 --> 01:20:49,399
you decided to let me
take the fall.

1399
01:20:49,533 --> 01:20:51,869
Because all you care about
is your paintings.

1400
01:20:52,003 --> 01:20:54,638
There's video of Owen and Laurel
on the night of the murder.

1401
01:20:54,772 --> 01:20:56,874
The cops thought it was me
because of my Lakers hat.

1402
01:20:57,008 --> 01:20:58,886
You're the only one that knows
about my Lakers hat.

1403
01:20:58,910 --> 01:21:03,113
So you are an accessory
to murder and a liar, Andy!

1404
01:21:03,246 --> 01:21:06,017
And a cold-hearted snake.

1405
01:21:06,149 --> 01:21:07,651
What?

1406
01:21:08,318 --> 01:21:09,887
Okay.

1407
01:21:11,421 --> 01:21:14,458
Uh... Okay, I was wrong.

1408
01:21:14,591 --> 01:21:17,057
Um, you're not the bad
guy. He's the bad guy.

1409
01:21:18,029 --> 01:21:20,697
Shit. Can I take this back?
Can I take any of that back?

1410
01:21:20,832 --> 01:21:21,665
Put these on.

1411
01:21:21,799 --> 01:21:22,666
I...
Okay. Can you...

1412
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,334
One second.

1413
01:21:24,468 --> 01:21:26,336
Okay, I'm very sorry.
Uh, I was wrong.

1414
01:21:26,470 --> 01:21:28,710
And... But you have to admit
it was a pretty good theory.

1415
01:21:28,773 --> 01:21:30,908
- I just missed a couple of...
- Shut up!

1416
01:21:31,441 --> 01:21:33,310
Really!

1417
01:21:34,311 --> 01:21:37,147
Ronald, what are you doing?

1418
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,650
I was in a bad spot.

1419
01:21:39,784 --> 01:21:42,686
You shouldn't have sent Fletch
to shake the tree.

1420
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:44,497
Why did you kill Laurel Goodwin?

1421
01:21:44,521 --> 01:21:46,556
I researched you, Fletch.

1422
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:48,860
You're a decent
investigative reporter.

1423
01:21:48,993 --> 01:21:51,963
I couldn't run the risk of you
nosing around in my business.

1424
01:21:52,096 --> 01:21:54,264
I needed you out of the picture.

1425
01:21:54,966 --> 01:21:56,199
I guess I'm flattered.

1426
01:21:56,333 --> 01:21:58,144
Inspector Monroe
came to see me today.

1427
01:21:58,168 --> 01:22:01,204
That's when I decided I had to
leave the country with the paintings

1428
01:22:01,338 --> 01:22:03,540
and tie up the loose ends.

1429
01:22:04,307 --> 01:22:05,585
How did you know
about my Lakers hat?

1430
01:22:05,609 --> 01:22:08,880
Mmm. Murderers get to keep
some secrets.

1431
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:13,650
Now, put on the handcuffs.

1432
01:22:13,785 --> 01:22:17,155
You weren't planning to take us
out to sea and tie us up together

1433
01:22:17,287 --> 01:22:18,622
and push us overboard, were you?

1434
01:22:18,756 --> 01:22:20,466
I was already prepared
to commit one murder tonight.

1435
01:22:20,490 --> 01:22:22,225
What makes you think
I won't commit two?

1436
01:22:22,827 --> 01:22:23,861
Oops.

1437
01:22:23,995 --> 01:22:25,672
Ronald, stop this bullshit!

1438
01:22:25,696 --> 01:22:27,397
Yeah!

1439
01:22:27,531 --> 01:22:29,566
Shh, shh, shh.
You raise your voice again,

1440
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,301
I'll just put on
some very loud music.

1441
01:22:31,435 --> 01:22:34,404
Can I pick it, please? 'Cause
the EDM... Just anything else.

1442
01:22:34,538 --> 01:22:36,506
- Dixieland, jazz...
- ...bluegrass.

1443
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:38,009
Put on the handcuffs, asshole.

1444
01:22:38,142 --> 01:22:39,309
You're sick!

1445
01:22:39,443 --> 01:22:40,923
He hasn't had a cold
in over 20 years.

1446
01:22:41,045 --> 01:22:42,765
- I should shoot you now.
- Ronnie!

1447
01:22:42,814 --> 01:22:44,182
- Help!
- Help! He's got a gun!

1448
01:22:45,783 --> 01:22:48,518
Ronnie! What the hell
are you doing down there?

1449
01:22:48,652 --> 01:22:50,454
Ah!

1450
01:22:55,292 --> 01:22:57,260
Oh, no!

1451
01:23:17,714 --> 01:23:18,714
Hi, Fletch.

1452
01:23:19,884 --> 01:23:20,918
Uh, hi.

1453
01:23:23,755 --> 01:23:28,760
Uh, so, the Scotch
should be a fine single malt.

1454
01:23:28,893 --> 01:23:31,796
Again, it's a hospital,
but we'll see what we can do.

1455
01:23:31,929 --> 01:23:33,463
What about beer?

1456
01:23:34,331 --> 01:23:36,266
Edibles make me gassy.

1457
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:38,478
Horan's boat is
that big green...

1458
01:23:38,502 --> 01:23:40,370
Turned into a pretty nice night.

1459
01:23:41,638 --> 01:23:42,907
From a weather standpoint.

1460
01:23:44,608 --> 01:23:46,276
Sorry. No paintings.

1461
01:23:46,409 --> 01:23:48,311
What? No, no, no. That can't be.

1462
01:23:48,445 --> 01:23:49,781
We checked everywhere.

1463
01:23:49,914 --> 01:23:51,691
We cut open the mattresses,
ripped out the paneling.

1464
01:23:51,715 --> 01:23:53,316
There are no paintings
on that boat.

1465
01:23:53,450 --> 01:23:54,618
That is impossible.

1466
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:56,754
Wait.
Uh, how did you find me here?

1467
01:23:56,888 --> 01:23:59,556
Well, when there was
the incident here last night,

1468
01:23:59,689 --> 01:24:01,691
I put together
that Ho ran owned the boat

1469
01:24:01,826 --> 01:24:05,062
and that we found you
parked in front of his gallery.

1470
01:24:05,196 --> 01:24:07,098
Well, I put that together.

1471
01:24:07,231 --> 01:24:08,933
Well, yes, I...
I know that, Griz,

1472
01:24:09,066 --> 01:24:13,237
but when I say I, I mean...
Griz... Griz put that together.

1473
01:24:13,370 --> 01:24:14,972
So I went to see Ho ran

1474
01:24:15,106 --> 01:24:17,416
and there was something about
him that just made me suspicious.

1475
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:20,878
So we did some digging and
found out that he was heavily in debt

1476
01:24:21,012 --> 01:24:24,215
and being investigated
for a false insurance claim.

1477
01:24:24,347 --> 01:24:26,067
- Mmm.
- Mm-hmm. I also found that.

1478
01:24:26,117 --> 01:24:28,753
Griz put
that together. Just saying.

1479
01:24:28,886 --> 01:24:30,620
And that's when it hit me.

1480
01:24:32,156 --> 01:24:33,257
Us.
Us.

1481
01:24:33,390 --> 01:24:35,692
Ho ran killed Laurel Goodwin.

1482
01:24:36,459 --> 01:24:37,905
Went to go arrest him.
He wasn't there.

1483
01:24:37,929 --> 01:24:40,463
And we had a hunch
that he might be here.

1484
01:24:41,531 --> 01:24:43,177
How did you connect him
to Laurel's murder?

1485
01:24:43,201 --> 01:24:45,502
He's always sanitizing
his hands. Mmm.

1486
01:24:45,635 --> 01:24:50,274
He had the cups for the
ink pens, clean and dirty.

1487
01:24:50,407 --> 01:24:51,843
Germophobe.
Germophobe.

1488
01:24:51,976 --> 01:24:54,087
So take a look at this right
here. Look at this video.

1489
01:24:54,111 --> 01:24:55,345
Look at the very end.

1490
01:25:01,418 --> 01:25:04,155
- Oh, look there.
- Uh, what? I don't s...

1491
01:25:04,288 --> 01:25:07,124
He jerks his hand back because
she touches his bare skin.

1492
01:25:08,259 --> 01:25:09,359
Germaphobe.
Germaphobe.

1493
01:25:09,492 --> 01:25:11,796
But that man has black hair.

1494
01:25:11,929 --> 01:25:13,831
Found this cheap black hair dye.

1495
01:25:13,965 --> 01:25:17,434
So, how did he know who I really
was? That I wear a Lakers hat?

1496
01:25:17,567 --> 01:25:21,404
Do you remember a picture of you
from an article from <i>La Republica?</i>

1497
01:25:22,405 --> 01:25:23,640
Sure.

1498
01:25:25,343 --> 01:25:26,944
Oh...

1499
01:25:27,845 --> 01:25:29,379
- I was wearing my lucky hat.
- Mm-hmm.

1500
01:25:29,512 --> 01:25:32,216
And I Zoomed with Ho ran.
Wow, I am an idiot.

1501
01:25:32,350 --> 01:25:34,417
Thank you.
Yup. Finally, a consensus.

1502
01:25:34,551 --> 01:25:37,188
Okay, but why Laurel Goodwin?
Why her?

1503
01:25:37,321 --> 01:25:40,358
Laurel Goodwin was auditing
Horan's class at Harvard.

1504
01:25:40,490 --> 01:25:44,929
Ho ran had installed some art in
Tasserly's townhouse. So, he had a key.

1505
01:25:45,062 --> 01:25:47,631
He feigned interest in Miss
Goodwin's career to lure her there.

1506
01:25:47,765 --> 01:25:49,934
She was just a convenient
victim.

1507
01:25:50,067 --> 01:25:52,904
He wanted to frame Fletch.
Oh, God. Poor woman.

1508
01:25:53,603 --> 01:25:54,972
That bastard!

1509
01:25:57,540 --> 01:25:59,777
He was going to kill me, too.

1510
01:26:03,281 --> 01:26:05,682
I'm gonna head back
to the station. Yup.

1511
01:26:07,450 --> 01:26:11,621
Well, let me just say I'm glad
that we finally solved this case.

1512
01:26:14,225 --> 01:26:15,960
Together.

1513
01:26:16,426 --> 01:26:18,095
- We?
- We.

1514
01:26:18,595 --> 01:26:19,897
We three.

1515
01:26:20,865 --> 01:26:21,865
No.

1516
01:26:21,899 --> 01:26:25,602
- Mmm.
- We solved the case.

1517
01:26:25,735 --> 01:26:27,671
- Well, we.
- No, no, no, no.

1518
01:26:27,805 --> 01:26:29,941
You came barefoot into my office

1519
01:26:30,074 --> 01:26:33,244
and woke up my child with a list of
suspects that Ho ran wasn't even on!

1520
01:26:33,377 --> 01:26:35,897
- I don't know about that.
- You got your ass kicked on the boat

1521
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:38,581
and almost got shot in the face.
That's what you did.

1522
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:41,584
I'm gonna go to the car.

1523
01:26:42,219 --> 01:26:43,754
I'm gonna miss us.

1524
01:26:43,888 --> 01:26:46,357
But you know, only you could
have snuck in a place like this

1525
01:26:46,489 --> 01:26:48,192
and been able to just blend in.

1526
01:26:48,993 --> 01:26:51,095
They'd never let me in
a place like this.

1527
01:26:51,594 --> 01:26:52,594
And I'm an inspector.

1528
01:26:52,662 --> 01:26:54,664
Yeah, I know.

1529
01:26:55,433 --> 01:26:56,666
'Cause you're Jewish.

1530
01:26:57,335 --> 01:26:58,568
It's not right.

1531
01:26:59,971 --> 01:27:01,005
<i>L'chaim.</i>

1532
01:27:03,808 --> 01:27:05,876
Okay, Andy, why didn't you just
come clean with me?

1533
01:27:06,010 --> 01:27:09,679
This all would have gone so much
easier had I known the whole story.

1534
01:27:10,948 --> 01:27:13,250
I couldn't trust you
with all the information.

1535
01:27:13,384 --> 01:27:14,384
Why?

1536
01:27:14,452 --> 01:27:16,586
Because, like you said...

1537
01:27:17,687 --> 01:27:18,856
you're an idiot.

1538
01:27:18,990 --> 01:27:20,630
So you were just using me
this whole time?

1539
01:27:20,724 --> 01:27:22,026
No, Fletch.

1540
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:25,695
It's just that I fall in love
with idiots.

1541
01:27:25,830 --> 01:27:28,933
I may be an idiot,
but I saved your life.

1542
01:27:29,467 --> 01:27:30,801
You didn't.

1543
01:27:30,935 --> 01:27:33,371
That girl,
she saved both of our lives.

1544
01:27:33,503 --> 01:27:35,039
Well... What was her name?

1545
01:27:36,207 --> 01:27:37,241
Grizzly.

1546
01:27:37,375 --> 01:27:40,144
Actually, you know what?
I never did get her...

1547
01:27:40,277 --> 01:27:41,479
Hold on one second.

1548
01:27:44,815 --> 01:27:46,851
Oh, this is fun song.

1549
01:27:47,351 --> 01:27:48,819
Griz, one last thing.

1550
01:27:48,953 --> 01:27:52,089
I never got your real name.
I... I gotta know.

1551
01:27:53,224 --> 01:27:55,960
It's Griselda. And I'm not
ashamed of my name, Fletch.

1552
01:27:56,093 --> 01:27:57,862
You shouldn't be ashamed
of yours either.

1553
01:27:57,995 --> 01:27:59,230
Thanks.

1554
01:27:59,363 --> 01:28:01,074
There's a lot of other things
you could be ashamed of.

1555
01:28:01,098 --> 01:28:03,367
Like your arrogance,
your white privilege, your feet.

1556
01:28:03,501 --> 01:28:07,304
Okay, well, um, thank you
for saving my ass, Griselda.

1557
01:28:07,438 --> 01:28:08,798
- Mmm.
- And if I could just say...

1558
01:28:08,839 --> 01:28:10,573
Hands off the car, Fletch.

1559
01:28:27,491 --> 01:28:28,893
<i>The fuck do you want?</i>

1560
01:28:29,026 --> 01:28:30,026
Hi, Frank.

1561
01:28:30,061 --> 01:28:32,029
You still want that exclusive?

1562
01:28:57,121 --> 01:28:58,655
Menti, how are you, my friend?

1563
01:28:58,789 --> 01:29:00,291
<i>Buongiorno,</i> Fletch.

1564
01:29:01,691 --> 01:29:02,827
How were the Canary Islands?

1565
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:06,097
Ah. You arranged everything
splendidly.

1566
01:29:06,230 --> 01:29:07,664
Hmm.

1567
01:29:07,798 --> 01:29:11,769
Well, it turns out... the
Countess actually loves you.

1568
01:29:11,902 --> 01:29:13,703
She was even able
to forgive Angela.

1569
01:29:13,838 --> 01:29:16,140
- She's a remarkable woman.
- That she is.

1570
01:29:16,273 --> 01:29:19,310
And in Angela's defense, she
didn't know about the murder.

1571
01:29:19,443 --> 01:29:22,612
I think she stole the paintings so
the Countess couldn't have them.

1572
01:29:22,745 --> 01:29:24,614
I think she resents
sharing your love.

1573
01:29:24,747 --> 01:29:26,283
Where are the ladies now?

1574
01:29:26,417 --> 01:29:27,852
They are spending your money.

1575
01:29:27,985 --> 01:29:30,121
Ha!

1576
01:29:30,254 --> 01:29:34,091
So I have your paintings in a
van in a garage very near here.

1577
01:29:34,225 --> 01:29:37,194
I had a thought.
Why don't you keep them?

1578
01:29:38,462 --> 01:29:39,830
You can't be serious.

1579
01:29:39,964 --> 01:29:42,699
It is better for my family
if the paintings stay away.

1580
01:29:42,833 --> 01:29:44,802
Are you absolutely sure
about that?

1581
01:29:44,935 --> 01:29:50,040
The paintings are worth
roughly... a shitload.

1582
01:29:51,041 --> 01:29:53,611
They were stolen by the <i>fascisti</i>
in the first place.

1583
01:29:53,743 --> 01:29:56,080
They always made me feel guilty.

1584
01:29:56,947 --> 01:30:00,017
<i>- Grazie.</i>
<i>- Grazie</i> right back to you.

1585
01:30:00,784 --> 01:30:02,553
Angela is my daughter.

1586
01:30:02,685 --> 01:30:04,822
I can forgive her.
Can you?

1587
01:30:04,955 --> 01:30:09,160
Well, I would have,
but she, uh, dumped me.

1588
01:30:10,027 --> 01:30:12,363
She dumped you.

1589
01:30:12,496 --> 01:30:14,632
Maybe someday
I will understand...

1590
01:30:14,765 --> 01:30:16,367
...the sex from behind.

1591
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,102
<i>Che cosa?</i>

1592
01:30:19,203 --> 01:30:21,605
My Italian is very good.

1593
01:30:21,738 --> 01:30:22,883
Ah.

1594
01:30:26,443 --> 01:30:28,212
<i>- Mio dio!</i>
- Papa?

1595
01:30:28,345 --> 01:30:29,613
<i>Sei un visione?</i>

1596
01:30:29,746 --> 01:30:31,348
I'm not a ghost, my darling.

1597
01:30:31,482 --> 01:30:32,650
Papa!
Ang.

1598
01:30:34,318 --> 01:30:35,718
I'm fine. I am fine.

1599
01:30:35,853 --> 01:30:37,621
I... I have a confession
for you both.

1600
01:30:39,190 --> 01:30:40,934
We make believe my kidnapping,

1601
01:30:40,958 --> 01:30:42,302
- so that we...
- Why you do that?

1602
01:30:42,326 --> 01:30:44,261
To discover
who take the paintings.

1603
01:30:44,395 --> 01:30:46,435
- Oh.
- We decide it's best to...

1604
01:30:52,937 --> 01:30:55,239
Slo Mo Monroe.

1605
01:30:57,775 --> 01:30:59,015
Don't you have any other cases?

1606
01:30:59,076 --> 01:31:01,645
- No, I solved them all.
- Yeah? Mazel.

1607
01:31:01,812 --> 01:31:03,113
Oh, I got something
for your son.

1608
01:31:03,247 --> 01:31:04,949
I was gonna send it
to your office.

1609
01:31:06,116 --> 01:31:07,218
Huh.

1610
01:31:10,387 --> 01:31:13,090
I mean, is that adorable?

1611
01:31:13,723 --> 01:31:15,392
My wife will love it.

1612
01:31:15,526 --> 01:31:16,736
Did you find the paintings yet?

1613
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:18,395
No, but city and highway cops

1614
01:31:18,529 --> 01:31:22,199
are on the lookout for a '98
turquoise Ford Econoline van.

1615
01:31:22,833 --> 01:31:25,102
Plates Victor-Gary-2-7-0-Sam.

1616
01:31:25,236 --> 01:31:27,805
Apparently registered
to an I. M. Fletcher.

1617
01:31:27,938 --> 01:31:30,274
I gave that van away, so...

1618
01:31:30,407 --> 01:31:32,076
So you're telling me
if we stop that van,

1619
01:31:32,209 --> 01:31:34,169
we're not gonna find
the Count's stolen paintings?

1620
01:31:34,211 --> 01:31:36,046
You are one relentless guy,
Morris.

1621
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:37,580
You would have made
a good reporter.

1622
01:31:37,681 --> 01:31:40,517
Mm-mmm, no. I don't
know who people hate more.

1623
01:31:40,651 --> 01:31:42,987
Cops or reporters.

1624
01:31:44,421 --> 01:31:45,421
It's cops.

1625
01:31:47,491 --> 01:31:48,926
Bye.

1626
01:31:49,059 --> 01:31:50,937
<i>Enterprise Exotic Car Rental.</i>

1627
01:31:50,961 --> 01:31:53,497
<i>Hi. Yeah. Listen, uh, I
had a family emergency come up</i>

1628
01:31:53,631 --> 01:31:55,532
<i>and I can't return the car
in person.</i>

1629
01:31:55,666 --> 01:31:58,569
<i>So I parked it in an alleyway
right off of Utica there</i>

1630
01:31:58,702 --> 01:32:01,181
and, uh, you wouldn't believe it,
somebody stole the license plates.

1631
01:32:01,205 --> 01:32:02,382
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

1632
01:32:02,406 --> 01:32:04,475
So someone can just
pick that up.

1633
01:32:04,608 --> 01:32:06,653
<i>Well, sir, you're
gonna have to file a police report.</i>

1634
01:32:06,677 --> 01:32:09,513
Yeah. I'm sorry. You're
breaking... You're breaking up there.

1635
01:32:28,899 --> 01:32:32,136
Menti.

1636
01:32:32,269 --> 01:32:34,672
- Countess de Grassi.
<i>- Si?</i>

1637
01:32:34,805 --> 01:32:37,408
This came for you.

1638
01:32:37,776 --> 01:32:39,476
Only one?

1639
01:32:39,610 --> 01:32:44,214
Fletch.
You're a piece of shit.

1640
01:32:48,385 --> 01:32:50,921
I... I think that's, uh, Munch.

1641
01:32:52,823 --> 01:32:54,391
No way this shit's real.

1642
01:33:14,745 --> 01:33:16,547
That's gorgeous, Mignon.

01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:54,819
<i>that ugly fucking painting?</i>

1648
01:33:54,952 --> 01:33:56,096
<i>I just threw it in the trash.</i>

1649
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:57,488
You're welcome.

1650
01:33:57,621 --> 01:33:59,065

- None of your business.

1651
01:33:59,089 --> 01:34:00,491
<i>I need you for a story.</i>

1652
01:34:00,624 --> 01:34:02,827
There's a shit show going on
over at March News Corp.

1653
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:04,928
Old man March

1654
01:34:05,062 --> 01:34:06,662

<i>I need you to go to Chicago

Let me just stop you
right there, Frank.

1657
01:34:10,634 --> 01:34:13,203
I am still officially retired
from investigative reporting

1658
01:34:13,337 --> 01:34:15,515
and there's no amount of money
that could change my mind.

1659
01:34:15,539 --> 01:34:18,242
Well, that's perfect, because this
pays roughly no amount of money.

1660
01:34:18,375 --> 01:34:20,812
Come on, Fletch.
Aren't you bored?

1661
01:34:20,944 --> 01:34:22,646
Not yet. Bye-bye.

1662
01:34:22,781 --> 01:34:24,341
<i>Wait, wait, wait.
Don't hang up.</i>

1663
01:34:24,448 --> 01:34:26,183
Oh, and that
ugly fucking painting,

1664
01:34:26,316 --> 01:34:28,152
have it appraised
before you throw it away.

1665
01:34:28,285 --> 01:34:29,319
<i>What? What?</i>

1666
01:34:29,453 --> 01:34:30,889
<i>- Tay!
- What?</i>

1667
01:34:31,021 --> 01:34:32,656
<i>Where's the trash? Give me...</i>

1668
01:38:27,290 --> 01:38:28,625
<i>Five stars.</i>
