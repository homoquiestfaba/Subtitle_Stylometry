1
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,500
Steve, this is Roy.

2
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,900
There's something funny
going on in "E" section.

3
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,400
Let's check it out.

4
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,700
I'm in room 168.

5
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,700
Nothing here.

6
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,000
Room 159.

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Nothing doing.

8
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,500
He's right between you.

9
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,800
Room 160, negative.

10
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,800
Damn.

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,300
Come on, now.
Talk to me, people.

12
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,700
You guys found anything yet?

13
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,100
Hang on, Roy.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,900
161, nobody here.

15
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,500
I'm in room 162.

16
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
Je-sus.

17
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,500
We have a break-in.
Break-in confirmed.

18
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,700
Condition red.
Secure the building.

19
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,400
Secure the building.

20
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,100
All "D" Sections are sealed.

21
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,100
"G" Sections sealed.

22
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,800
Coming up stairway alpha.

23
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,400
Main gate closed.

24
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,000
We had him.
Turn on that there fence!

25
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,800
Damn!

26
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,900
Maxine Grey. Good morning.

27
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,000
Uh, right. Yes.
I could take a message.

28
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
OK. Thank you very much.

29
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,900
Maxine Grey. Good morning.

30
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,700
Uh, yes. Hello.

31
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,700
OK. Well, give me your number.

32
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,000
Right. I'll give him
the message.

33
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,400
Thanks for calling. Bye-bye.

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,700
Maxine Grey. Good morning.

35
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,000
No, I'm sorry.
They're all in a conference.

36
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,900
May I take a message?

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,400
Sorry.

38
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,800
Oh. OK. Thank you.

39
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,900
Bye-bye.

40
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,700
What you got there?

41
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,900
Computer printouts.

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,600
How did you get it?

43
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,000
I random-accessed their computer
with a digital sequencer...

44
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,500
and force-fed
adjusting parameters...

45
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,400
until it just
punched them out.

46
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,700
Gave them a virus
for good measure.

47
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
That's good.

48
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,000
I love telephones.

49
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,600
OK. I'll tell him.

50
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,900
They're nearly ready
for you now.

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,400
Five minutes.

52
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,700
Thank you.

53
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,100
I sprained my ankle
this morning.

54
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,900
Oh, sorry.

55
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,900
Yeah.

56
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,300
Man, I'd just kill
for a cup of coffee.

57
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,800
I don't suppose you
could run down the hallway...

58
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,700
and get me a cup of coffee,
could ya?

59
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,900
- Sure. No problem.
- Yeah?

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,400
Yeah. How do you take it?

61
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,300
Black's fine.

62
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,300
Black?

63
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,400
Yeah. I'll hold that for you.

64
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,300
Good morning.

65
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,800
- Be right back.
- OK.

66
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,700
I don't have
any further information for you.

67
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,600
Maxine Grey. Good morning.

68
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,000
Uh, yes. Hello.

69
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,700
That meeting is tomorrow.

70
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,000
I beg your pardon.

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We, uh, random-accessed
their computer...

72
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,500
with a digital sequencer...

73
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,100
then force-fed
adjustable parabolics...

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,200
until it just, uh,
punched them out.

75
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,300
Then, of course, I...

76
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,200
slipped their computer a virus.

77
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,100
What the hell.

78
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,000
Here's what they got.

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,500
They've got your moisturizer...

80
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,400
your foundation cream,
and your lip gloss.

81
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,900
No question about it, folks...
they're ripping you off.

82
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:38,000
Maxine Grey owes you
a debt of gratitude, Mr. Boyd.

83
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,500
Well, um...

84
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,400
I can't wait to collect.

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,500
Here.

86
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Hello?

87
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,100
Who do you like in the fifth?

88
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,100
I think you have
the wrong number.

89
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,600
You know where he is?

90
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,100
All right. I'll tell him.

91
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Crank.

92
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,300
For me?

93
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,900
Some guy says,
"Who do you like in the fifth?"

94
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,700
Oh, shit.

95
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,100
What?

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,800
Hey, uh, I got to go.

97
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,600
Are you serious?

98
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,500
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Washington, D. C...

99
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Dulles
International Airport.

100
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,300
We have to make a stop
at International.

101
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,500
You're holding tickets.
Chicago to Berlin.

102
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,000
John Jones and Avram Levi.

103
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,200
Why me?

104
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,800
Why take the Battleship Missouri
out of mothballs?

105
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,900
Welcome to Virginia, Sam.

106
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,800
Elliot.

107
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,700
The company has missed you.

108
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,200
Good flight?

109
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,100
I could use some coffee.

110
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,200
Help yourself.

111
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,600
You know my guys
Dick Maxfield, Bruce Wilson.

112
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,000
And this is a very special
friend to the company...

113
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,900
Mr. Paco Gonzalez.

114
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,100
Mr. Gonzalez is in...
Colombian pharmaceuticals.

115
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,400
I would very much like to
help your country.

116
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,800
So, is this
a retirement party?

117
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,700
We're all riding off
into the sunset, are we?

118
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,100
Governments come and go.

119
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,500
Bureaucracies remain the same.

120
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,600
Just look at us.

121
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,300
Now...

122
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,700
we've been approached
by Colonel Grigori Golitsen...

123
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,600
with a proposition
that we find interesting.

124
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,700
The KGB's making
propositions to you?

125
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,400
We do a lot of business
with the KGB these days.

126
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,500
They're cutting deals.

127
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
You remember Ernest Sobel?

128
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,400
Ernest Simpson Sobel...

129
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,100
U-2 pilot shot down
over Tashkent, 1969...

130
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,500
convicted of espionage...

131
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,200
life imprisonment.

132
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,500
For two million,
we can have him.

133
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,100
Don't tell me
they're that broke.

134
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,100
Well, we'll throw in
one of theirs.

135
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That way
it'll look like a swap.

136
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,700
That's not illegal.

137
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,600
Looks better for Grigori, too.

138
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,900
If this works, it could be
a whole new program for us.

139
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,900
Why don't you just
wait a couple months...

140
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,400
and Gorbachev
will send them all back...

141
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,600
for National Brotherhood week?

142
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,000
Gorbachev may not
be around that long...

143
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,900
and then
we'll have lost the chance.

144
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,400
The President loves this guy.

145
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,000
You get him back...

146
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,200
he'll give us
the medal of honor.

147
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,400
We don't want
the medal of honor!

148
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,800
What we would like...

149
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,300
is to get Congress
off the Company's back...

150
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,100
so it can resume
full effectiveness...

151
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,800
in defending this nation
from its enemies.

152
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,700
Thank you, Colonel Grissom.

153
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,500
See, Sam, they're, uh...

154
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,700
they're pissed because
we didn't tell them...

155
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,100
about the wall coming down...

156
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,300
and then we goofed
on the Noriega thing.

157
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,300
Who do you want to swap?

158
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,900
Know this guy?

159
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,300
Pyiotr lvanovich Grushenko.

160
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,500
You do know him.

161
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,500
Well, it just says
his name right there.

162
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,400
Very effective mole.

163
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,800
Penetrated
the State Department...

164
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,000
Southeast Asian Division...

165
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,800
all the way up
to level three clearance.

166
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,200
Arrested in 1984.

167
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,700
Nobody gives a shit
about this guy.

168
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,100
Come on, Sam.

169
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,900
This is not arms for hostages.

170
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,200
This is perfectly
straightforward.

171
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,400
If it's so straightforward...

172
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,400
what are we doing here
in the bubble room...

173
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,000
with Senor Gonzalez?

174
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,700
I would very much like to
help your country.

175
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,800
Mr. Gonzalez' associates
have very kindly offered...

176
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,200
to put up the $2 million
necessary for this operation.

177
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,200
No way we can
ask the taxpayers...

178
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,600
to help us out
on this one, Sam.

179
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,500
The bills are numbered
just in case...

180
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,800
Please. It hurts
my professional pride, OK?

181
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,000
Sam.

182
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,200
May I call you Sam?

183
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,000
Yeah.

184
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:53,900
The point is,
this is not exactly kosher.

185
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,200
But here's a chance
to get back a major player...

186
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,900
with a minimum of fanfare.

187
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,200
Define minimum.

188
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,600
You.

189
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,900
No backup?

190
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,200
Perfectly straightforward.

191
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,400
You pick up Grushenko...

192
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,500
get him to Berlin
by the Fourth...

193
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,800
bring home Sobel.

194
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,500
"John Jones."

195
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,400
What's the difference?

196
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,800
John Jones, man from Mars.

197
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,600
"Avram Levi."

198
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,300
I'm Israeli?

199
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,100
It's just a precaution.

200
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,200
Well, I'm no poli-sci major.

201
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,100
By the way,
I never signed for the money.

202
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,300
What money?

203
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,900
What about expenses?

204
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,300
Here's a voucher.

205
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,900
take it to the cashier
on the first floor.

206
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,300
Try to keep accurate records.

207
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,000
They're all over us
about that sort of thing now.

208
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,400
Restaurants, travel...

209
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,000
Movies, cookies.

210
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,200
Where will the swap take place?

211
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,800
We'll let you know.

212
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,300
OK.

213
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,400
God, I hate those old guys.

214
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,800
We can't use anyone on
the current roster, Pierce.

215
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,700
I hate it when I see
those wheels going around.

216
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,500
And the North Dakota
sugar beet crop...

217
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,500
is said to have been
the best in ten years.

218
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,100
Farmers credited
the recent rains...

219
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,300
for ensuring
the bumper harvest.

220
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,500
In Texas,
there's still no clue...

221
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,900
to explain the mysterious
disappearance...

222
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,000
of Texas
A&M Professor Norbert Kelly...

223
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,500
whose abandoned car was
found by police yesterday.

224
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,600
Theories that Kelly
may have left the state...

225
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,100
have brought in
FBI investigators...

226
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,500
in a widening search effort.

227
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,000
Coming up next, the weather.

228
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,500
Hey, check it out, man.

229
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,800
Hey. Boy, you never
touch me like that!

230
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,900
Hey, scumbag,
where are you going?

231
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,800
Hey, get back here!

232
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,200
Your mama!

233
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,000
Yo, yo, guard, man...

234
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,900
bring that Russkie back here!

235
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,100
He's mine!

236
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You ain't asked nobody
if you could take him.

237
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,800
Peter lvanovich Grushenko?

238
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Pyiotr lvanovich.

239
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
Yeah.

240
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,900
What's happening?

241
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,400
Do you like baseball?

242
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,100
I know baseball.

243
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,700
You know baseball?

244
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,700
Well... Peter...

245
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,400
I got news for you.

246
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,400
That's your new uniform.

247
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,800
You're being traded.

248
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,300
Let's go.

249
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,300
Second boarding call...

250
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,700
for Air France flight 618
departing from gate 34...

251
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,400
from Chicago to Berlin Tegel.

252
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,200
Can you get me a newspaper?

253
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,700
We got to catch
that Air France flight.

254
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,000
What do you want?

255
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,100
"Washington Post."

256
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,500
You stay right there, OK?

257
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,700
Yeah, yeah.

258
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,100
Second boarding call...

259
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,600
for Air France flight 618
departing from gate 34...

260
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,800
from Chicago to Berlin Tegel.

261
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,000
Shit.

262
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,200
Excuse me. Pardon me.

263
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,200
Hey, what's wrong
with you, man?

264
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,100
Pardon me.

265
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,300
Excuse me. Excuse me.

266
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,700
Hey!

267
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,700
Final boarding call...

268
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,900
for Air France flight 618
departing from gate 34...

269
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,300
Shit. You son of a bitch.

270
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,300
You shit, you. Hey!

271
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,300
I told you not to
pull this crap, didn't I?

272
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,400
Had a good run?

273
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,900
What are you playing,
hide-and-go seek with me?

274
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,400
What the hell
do you want me to do?

275
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,300
You pick me up
in the middle of the night.

276
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,400
I'm not even allowed
to call my embassy.

277
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,400
Trade? Some bullshit.

278
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Food's pretty good.

279
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,100
Stoli.

280
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,300
Hey. I bet
you thought about Stoli...

281
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,200
more than once in the last
seven years, haven't you?

282
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,700
Hey, look, stupid,
if I had orders to kill you...

283
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,400
why didn't I
do it last night...

284
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,300
when we were out
in the middle of nowhere?

285
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,900
Hey, I don't know your orders.

286
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,800
I only know that...

287
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,300
for a real trade...

288
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,600
I have my lawyer,
I sign papers...

289
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,000
I get a military escort...

290
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
not some bullshit
in the middle of the night.

291
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,900
Escort? Who are you,
Princess Di?

292
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,900
Besides, Russians
would never trade for me.

293
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,100
I'm not worth it.

294
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,600
If you're not worth
trading for...

295
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,000
why would they
bother to kill you?

296
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,400
Maybe Russia think I talked.

297
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,200
Ever try Starka?

298
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,100
Starka.

299
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,400
It can't be as good as Stoli.

300
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,700
It's not. I just prefer it.

301
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,800
Starkle, huh?

302
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,900
Starka.

303
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Thanks.

304
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,900
I can understand
why you're nervous...

305
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,500
about what Moscow
might be thinking.

306
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,800
This whole deal,
you know, is weird.

307
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,600
I got to admit that.

308
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,000
So you don't know
what you're doing, either.

309
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,000
Hey, tovarishch,
I'm just like you...

310
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,900
except you're going home.

311
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,300
What makes you think
that I'm so crazy to go home?

312
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,600
At least in prison
I knew the rules.

313
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,500
Mesdames et messieurs...

314
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,000
bienvenue a Berlin.

315
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,500
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Berlin...

316
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,900
where the local time is 6:30.

317
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,200
I keep a gun in Berlin.

318
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,300
Clean yourself up.
You look like hell.

319
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,900
I'm glad somebody cares.

320
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,300
Why Berlin?

321
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,700
Are you kidding?
We always go to Berlin.

322
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
I still can't believe it.

323
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,400
No more wall.

324
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,600
They're gonna set it up
around London Bridge...

325
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,800
in Lake Havasu.

326
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,200
Want to buy a piece?

327
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,400
Can't you buy me a coat instead?
I'm freezing.

328
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,500
I got a better idea.

329
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
What's the name of that stuff?

330
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,300
Tell me which one
is the snorka.

331
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,100
You mean Starka?

332
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,600
That's easy.

333
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,200
Some kind of fruit vodka.

334
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,300
Is that Starka?

335
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,600
Don't like it?

336
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,700
Give us a bottle of Starka.

337
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,300
Mr. Boyd.

338
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,800
What's happening here?

339
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,900
The food is wonderful here.

340
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,900
That borscht was really good.

341
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,100
Speak English?

342
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,900
Hey, you're almost home.

343
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,500
Stop this crap.

344
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,800
Home, home.

345
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,200
Who the hell
do you think I am, E.T.?

346
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,800
That's funny.

347
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,500
I don't belong here.
I don't belong there.

348
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,700
You tell me where's home.

349
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,600
Search me.

350
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,000
Couldn't you just let me go?

351
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,800
Oh...

352
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,100
You could come with me.

353
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,700
Why would I want to do that?

354
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,700
Admit it, your life sucks.

355
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,600
Hey, leave my life
out of this.

356
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,200
You're used up like me.
Come on.

357
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,400
Why would I want to go
anywhere with you?

358
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,600
Why not?

359
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,900
We're not bad guys anymore.

360
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,000
The Russians are coming,
the Russians are coming, huh?

361
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,300
The Japanese are here.

362
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,100
They own your
whole fucking country.

363
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,700
What's that mean...

364
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,500
I'm supposed to go off
and elope with you?

365
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,000
Hey, you and me, we're...

366
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,300
we're servants
for a few assholes.

367
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,100
Same bullshit.

368
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,700
Hey, don't go all
Russian on me now, OK?

369
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,800
Whose ass you Americans
going to kick now, huh?

370
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,300
We always got Fidel.

371
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,200
We always got him, too.

372
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,100
True.

373
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,500
How you doing?

374
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,800
How do you think I am doing?

375
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,400
Don't take this personally,
all right?

376
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,200
What would you do
if the situation was reversed?

377
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,000
Look, don't take this
personally...

378
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,800
but it's a dumb question.

379
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,500
It's just
that I keep thinking...

380
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,400
it could be nice...

381
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,600
a country without bullshit.

382
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,100
One could invent a country.

383
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,500
As long as they serve Storka.

384
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,200
Mr. Boyd?

385
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
Yeah.

386
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,000
Hey, Sam.

387
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,400
I thought they retired you
after Nicaragua.

388
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:06,700
Mike. You're a long ways
from Central America.

389
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,800
I'll take that.

390
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,100
Does this have to be
such a big production?

391
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,200
No more wall.
We got to improvise.

392
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,400
We got the place
closed for maintenance.

393
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,700
Maintenance, huh?

394
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,300
You know there are
parts of the world, Sam...

395
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,600
where people would call
what you got in that bag...

396
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,000
a lot of money.

397
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,200
Now, listen up.

398
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,400
One double car,
one driver, and you.

399
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
That's all each side
is allowed.

400
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,400
I can follow you
on this thing...

401
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,300
and you can talk to me on
the phone till you get there.

402
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,300
Klaus.

403
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,500
Here is the old border.

404
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,700
As you can see...

405
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,000
the train goes under
where the wall used to be...

406
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:51,300
and inside East Berlin
for two stops.

407
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,600
and it shows up
in West Berlin again...

408
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,200
here at Deutsche Oper.

409
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,700
You'll go past
the first station...

410
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,900
Jannowitzbrucke.

411
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,600
KGB will be patrolling.

412
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,700
Is that legal?

413
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,500
Well, you can call it
confederated...

414
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,200
united, amalgamated.

415
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,800
There's 200,000
jumpy Russians...

416
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,800
still stationed
in East Germany.

417
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,200
Then you'll come to
Alexanderplatz.

418
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,000
They come in on their
branch line, lower level.

419
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,300
You follow the stairs
to the old terminal.

420
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,000
The wall went up
before they could finish it.

421
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,400
There's a chain link
fence with a gate.

422
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,600
Here's a key.

423
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,600
Only he goes through the fence,
or the shit hits the fan.

424
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,400
Copy?

425
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,400
Yeah.

426
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,300
How will they know
we're there?

427
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,400
Turn on the lights.

428
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,900
Game time.

429
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,100
Creep.

430
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,200
You speak English?

431
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,100
Ich verstehe kein wort...

432
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,900
aber ich weiss was
ich zu tun habe.

433
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,000
Wenn sie, uh,
wie heisst das wort?

434
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Uh... uh...

435
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,900
Slowly.

436
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,100
Mike, we're here.

437
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Take off.

438
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,300
Right.

439
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,300
We're coming up
to Jannowitzbrucke.

440
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Looks like "Alien."

441
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,000
We're here.

442
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,000
So are they.

443
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,000
Hold this.

444
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
Wow, look at this.

445
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,900
Two million bucks.

446
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,400
It's not exactly
an even trade.

447
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,500
I've got it, huh?

448
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,000
You mean
I'm just a courier, yes?

449
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,400
Something like that.

450
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,400
Interesting. Very interesting.

451
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,800
What are you
complaining about?

452
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
You're going to be
a millionaire...

453
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,300
for a couple of minutes.

454
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,800
Thank you very much.

455
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,900
Watch it.
These steps are rotten.

456
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,000
Sam...

457
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,400
thanks for the drinks.

458
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,000
It was nice.

459
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,600
Say hello
to Red Square for me.

460
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,700
Yeah, I will.

461
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,500
Think Storka.

462
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,400
Starka.

463
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,200
What the hell?

464
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,800
Grushenko, hold it!

465
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,900
Hold it! Hold it!

466
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,900
Let's go. Come on.

467
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,100
Stop!

468
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,500
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Let's go!

469
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,900
Back in the train!

470
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,300
Back it up!

471
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,600
Go! Go on!

472
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,300
You cover me.

473
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,900
I'll try to get
this thing started.

474
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,800
Come on. Come on.

475
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,900
Mike, abort! Abort!

476
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,100
What?

477
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,500
No! Back!

478
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,900
No way.

479
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,000
Back!

480
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,900
Goddamn, you son of a bitch!

481
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,900
Thanks for waiting.

482
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,500
Where in the hell did you go?

483
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,300
What happened down there?

484
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,600
I liked you better
than I liked him.

485
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,900
Mayday. Mayday.

486
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,700
They're heading towards...

487
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,900
Deutsche Oper.

488
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,800
Now, I want that station
cordoned off, now.

489
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,300
You don't want to stop here?

490
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,500
No. They'll be expecting that.

491
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,300
By the way,
I want my gun back.

492
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,200
OK.

493
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,800
Patch me through to Washington.

494
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:41,700
See what the boys
in the back room will have

495
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,700
And tell them
I'm having the same

496
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:52,900
Go see what the boys
in the back room will have

497
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:58,300
And give them
the poison they need

498
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,900
And when I die

499
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,600
Don't spend my money

500
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:10,000
On flowers and my picture
in a frame

501
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,700
Just see what the boys
in the back room will have

502
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:22,300
And tell them I sighed

503
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,900
Wer ist dein freund?

504
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,000
She said she likes you.

505
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,000
Just act natural, OK?

506
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,900
What?

507
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,900
I'll have the same

508
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,200
Get us a couple of drinks
and don't try anything funny.

509
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,100
You're kidding.

510
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,100
Hey, you know what
I'm talking about.

511
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,600
Listen, if I was
trying to do anything...

512
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,800
why did I give back
the pistol?

513
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,700
Could I have
an outside line, please?

514
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,100
Yeah, why did you?

515
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,500
Stupid of me.

516
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,800
Hey, that's right.

517
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,400
Number thirteen in the back.

518
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,000
Hey, I've got my eyes on you.

519
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,300
Excuse me.

520
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,200
Wo ist die toilette?

521
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,400
Da um die ecke dort.

522
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,500
Danke.

523
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,600
You screwed up!

524
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,100
No. They screwed up.

525
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,800
What are you talking about?

526
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,700
You opened fire in East Berlin!

527
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,200
Two guys are shot!

528
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,900
What are you trying to do,
restart the cold war?

529
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,800
Elliot, will you
just hold your dick?

530
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,200
Listen to me.

531
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,700
Will you just listen?

532
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,900
It wasn't him.

533
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,500
Oh, for Christ's sakes,
talk English.

534
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,700
You sound drunk.

535
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,100
It wasn't him.
It wasn't Sobel.

536
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
It was a guy I saw
at Dulles Airport...

537
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,600
day before yesterday.

538
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,300
What?

539
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,700
I'm trying to tell ya,
they're running a scam on you.

540
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,600
This guy didn't just
come out of prison.

541
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,000
He was waiting in line
at Aeroflot for tickets.

542
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
He had dark hair
and a mustache.

543
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,700
See, I saw his picture...

544
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,800
in the "Fort Worth Times"
where he had a beard.

545
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,700
The paper said he was
a professor or something...

546
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,900
and that he was missing.

547
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,000
Where are you?

548
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,600
Uh, we're at a gas station
on the autobahn.

549
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,400
Berlin.

550
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,500
Berlin.

551
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,000
Sam...

552
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,200
What?

553
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,400
Sam, you've got to
be straight with us...

554
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,300
or we can't help you out.

555
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,700
Yeah, I was just checking...

556
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,500
to see if your stuff
was all working.

557
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,900
We're still in Berlin.

558
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,100
Yeah, right.

559
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,100
Now, we've got a safe house
in West Berlin.

560
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,500
I assume we're talking
about West Berlin.

561
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,700
Yeah. West Berlin.

562
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,900
Wahringstrasse, number 32.

563
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,400
Wahringstrasse.

564
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,700
So, you hang loose
for one hour...

565
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,200
and then we'll bring you in.

566
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,100
32 Wahringstrasse.

567
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,800
Shit.

568
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,900
Shit!

569
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,300
Elliot, you didn't ask him
about the money.

570
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,400
Forget the money.

571
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,400
Gonzalez
ain't gonna open his yap.

572
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,200
You better get on
the zee phone, Elliot.

573
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,100
Yeah.

574
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,900
What's happening?

575
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,400
They're bringing us in...

576
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,600
32 Wahringstrasse in an hour.

577
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:13,600
And tell them I sighed

578
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:18,900
And tell them I cried

579
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,400
What's this?

580
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,500
Trabant... East German.

581
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,200
Is it alarmed?

582
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,200
Only if you frighten it.

583
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,500
Hey, did you ever notice...

584
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,800
the only thing you ever
hear about the Swiss Army...

585
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,300
is their knives?

586
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,200
The only thing
you hear about Trabant...

587
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,900
is they're plastic.

588
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,200
Do you believe
what they have told you?

589
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,600
I saved them from messing up.

590
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,100
I saved them a lot
of money, too, so I'm a hero.

591
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,200
You know what Dr. Johnson said?

592
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,200
Who?

593
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,700
He said that patriotism...

594
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,300
is the last refuge
of a scoundrel.

595
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,700
He said what?

596
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,400
That it wasn't Sobel.

597
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,300
Of course it was Sobel.
It was Sobel.

598
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,900
There's no question
who it was.

599
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,300
I told you not to use
these old guys.

600
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,400
Pierce, you weren't there.

601
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,200
He says no.
It was some guy he saw...

602
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,200
at the Aeroflot counter
at Dulles...

603
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,200
only with dark hair.

604
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,800
Some missing professor.

605
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,800
Oh, no.

606
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,300
What do you mean?

607
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,200
Pierce?

608
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,800
Elliot, I'm only gonna
say this to you once.

609
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,700
If that old man
sells his life story...

610
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,700
to "Time" magazine...

611
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:03,400
you and I go right into
the shithole.

612
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,900
I want you to put the toothpaste
back in the tube.

613
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,800
But, Pierce, the guy
just saved us from...

614
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,500
Elliot, it is
no longer fashionable...

615
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,100
to ransom hostages
with Colombian drug money.

616
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,500
Do you read me?

617
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,400
Yes.

618
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,900
Then do it.

619
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,000
Sam.

620
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,000
What?

621
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,900
Pull over for a second.

622
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,400
Just pull over.

623
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,400
Listen, I think
it's stupid of us...

624
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,100
to trust your safe house.

625
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,500
I think it stinks.

626
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,700
Come on. Let's just go.

627
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,600
You want to go, go.

628
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,700
Go.

629
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,300
Go.

630
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,600
I thought we were friends.

631
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,100
My friends aren't stupid.

632
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,400
I'll just take the money.

633
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,700
What are you going to do?

634
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,500
That's my business.

635
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Son of a bitch!

636
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,600
What kept you?

637
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,000
Couldn't find a parking place.

638
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,600
Shall I ring the bell?

639
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,200
No, wait a minute.

640
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,200
Don't want to wake up
the neighborhood.

641
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,600
What do you know about this?

642
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,500
Nothing.

643
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,500
I just know Halloween
when I see it.

644
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,400
Don't you think you're being
a little theatrical?

645
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,800
Someone's got to
take care of you.

646
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,200
Ooh! Elliot... that little
creep bastard.

647
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,600
This way.

648
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,900
I thought you were leaving.

649
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,600
Meantime, we're even, OK?

650
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,500
I didn't realize Russians
were so sentimental.

651
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,100
Yeah. We are.

652
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,800
Can you go higher up?

653
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,500
Is there someone else
to bring us in?

654
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,600
Hey, you don't get it,
do you, tovarishch?

655
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,800
There's no place
to bring us in to.

656
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,800
If I go back,
assuming I get there alive...

657
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,900
I'm the next Oliver North
without a chestful of medals...

658
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,000
with an Israeli passport, yet.

659
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,400
We've still got the money.

660
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,000
The money is all numbered.

661
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,800
It would be
like signing our names.

662
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,300
We've got to ditch the car.

663
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,200
What do you think they'll do
when they find out?

664
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,700
Close up Berlin.

665
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,100
Send it here.

666
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,400
The Cia, Langley, Virginia.

667
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,900
Oh, yeah, they, uh...

668
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,800
they showed up, all right.

669
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,500
Blew up the bloody house
and left.

670
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,800
We're working on it.

671
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,000
Vier neun drei und
dreissig auf der autobahn.

672
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,000
How long is this gonna take?

673
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,400
This is the new,
improved, big Berlin.

674
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,400
These people don't jump for us
like they used to.

675
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,700
It's gonna cost.

676
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,600
Yeah, yeah.

677
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,700
Haben sie diese manner
gesehen?

678
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,800
Der verkehr ist umgeleitet.

679
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,400
Hier ist spandau.

680
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,500
Avram Levi und John Jones.

681
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,700
What are we telling
the German cops?

682
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,500
Either it's Ahmed Jabril,
the Pan Am bomber...

683
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,100
or an Iraqi hit squad.

684
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,200
What time is it over there?

685
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,500
Almost two A.M.

686
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,900
We'll need some passports.

687
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,300
Know what?

688
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,200
I think I know the guy.

689
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,600
Where did you get that thing?

690
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,100
It was in Trabant.

691
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,500
We're on the corner...

692
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,300
of Zietenstrasse
and Kumarickestrasse.

693
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,200
Oh, I know who you mean.

694
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,100
- Horst.
- Horst.

695
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Yeah.

696
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,500
He's this way.

697
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,800
Are you coming?

698
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,600
What do you think?

699
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,000
Yeah, I'm coming.

700
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
How long will it take them
to come up with Horst?

701
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,800
Who knows?

702
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:33,000
- You ever played roulette?
- No.

703
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,400
You're playing it now.

704
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,200
OK?

705
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,100
Yeah, OK.

706
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,100
Who do you want to be?

707
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,300
It doesn't matter.

708
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,800
As long as
it's common market.

709
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:51,900
Oh, wait a minute.

710
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,800
I wonder if I should
shave off my mustache.

711
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,700
What do you think?

712
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,600
They're probably
expecting that.

713
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:01,000
Forget that mustache.
That's history by now.

714
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,200
Make you a Belgian.

715
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,900
Need credit cards, too.

716
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,100
American Express.

717
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,800
No. Visa, Mastercard.

718
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,200
And I want a rundown...

719
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,900
of anyone that Boyd
ever used in Berlin.

720
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,400
He's gonna be
calling in favors.

721
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,900
Hey, Elliot, you think
this could be the guy?

722
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,900
Well, let's see.

723
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,500
Horst Von Hoven.
Documents for...

724
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,900
Oh, not Horst.

725
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:31,200
Christ, is that old nazi
still on our payroll?

726
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:34,600
We got him back
from the Russians in '86.

727
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:52,400
You sign your Belgian
name, huh?

728
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,400
Uh, I think I'll keep
my own fingerprints here...

729
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,400
Horsty, OK, huh?

730
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,400
I develop
the extra passport photos...

731
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:13,500
in case you change
passports again.

732
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,700
You wait. Zwei minuten.

733
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,400
Standby.

734
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,700
Come on, you damn nazi.

735
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,900
Answer the phone.

736
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,500
Is that the correct address?

737
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,200
Get the lamp.

738
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,500
Hold it.

739
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,100
Horst, Horst...

740
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,500
Aw, fudge.

741
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,300
I didn't have the heart
to tell you...

742
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,200
but he started
working for us again...

743
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,900
after you
went up the river.

744
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,700
Aufmachen! Polizei!

745
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,200
Give me the keys.

746
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,700
Where's the key?

747
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,100
You got the keys.
You got the keys.

748
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,100
Come on. Come on.

749
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,000
Alles durchsuchen.

750
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,500
Yeah, yeah.
Take them to the lab.

751
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,000
Give me a sealer.

752
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,600
Herr Flinn?

753
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,300
Herr Flinn.

754
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Jesus.

755
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,200
Jesus.

756
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,000
Get me on the next flight
to Berlin.

757
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,800
This whole thing's
getting out of hand.

758
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,700
They're mugging
everybody in Europe.

759
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,000
Elliot, what do we
tell the old man?

760
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,200
You don't tell him a thing.

761
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,500
This is a company problem!

762
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,200
Was it good for you?

763
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,700
What's going on?

764
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,500
We're up to our armpits
in toothpaste.

765
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,500
We're off to Berlin
this afternoon.

766
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,900
Asshole. He never should
have used that old man.

767
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,900
How are we gonna play it?

768
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,300
I feel bad for Elliot.

769
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,500
Someone's
got to hang out to dry.

770
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,600
Bruce, one more thing...

771
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,600
I want the Sobel trade
back on.

772
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,200
It's more trouble
than it's worth, isn't it?

773
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:21,100
I know what it's worth.

774
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,900
Sam, Sam, look at this.

775
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,400
Guten morgen.

776
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,300
Come on. Come on.

777
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,700
Hey, it's been seven years.

778
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,000
Come on.

779
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,900
The way I figure it...

780
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,400
they could box us in here
for 24 hours.

781
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,400
After that,
it just gets too expensive.

782
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,000
She's pretty, eh?

783
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,400
Come on. Yeah.

784
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,400
The fruits of democracy.

785
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,100
Look at this fruit.

786
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,600
Hey, hey, hey, come on.

787
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,000
Fruit is the first place
they're gonna look.

788
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,400
I know. Just looking.

789
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,400
Wow!

790
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,700
Hey, they can't keep us
penned up here forever.

791
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,600
It's a totally
illegal operation.

792
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,400
It's all funded
by Colombian drug money.

793
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,400
Bikes?

794
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,000
Who do I know in Berlin?

795
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,400
Faisal Tewfik,
the Saudi arms dealer?

796
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,000
He owes me a favor.

797
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,300
This guy is rich.

798
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,800
He keeps a cigar humidor
right next to him.

799
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,700
It's got a million bucks in it.

800
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,600
Wait till you see this place.

801
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,000
He's got toilet seats
that are 14-karat gold...

802
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,200
more beautiful women...

803
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,800
than you've ever seen
outside of Las Vegas.

804
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,000
The guy's so rich,
he could ski uphill.

805
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,000
Pretty quiet.

806
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Yeah. I hope he's not off
on his yacht someplace.

807
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,400
Just how big of a favor
does he owe you?

808
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,500
Pretty big.

809
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,400
I bought some stingers
off him for the Contras.

810
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,200
Boneheads
couldn't make them work.

811
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,200
Turned out
they were defective.

812
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,200
No hard feelings, though.

813
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,100
Sam Boyd to see Faisal.

814
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,400
Ah, yeah.

815
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:04,800
Hello, Faisal.

816
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,000
Sam Boyd?

817
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,800
I do not believe.

818
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,200
Long time no nothing.

819
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,400
Come in, come in,
Sam Boyd.

820
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:30,600
Uh, excuse the mess.
I am... redecorating.

821
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,900
This is a friend of mine...
John Jones.

822
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,300
Your servant, Mr. Jones.

823
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,600
You are welcome to my house.

824
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,900
Mint tea all around?

825
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,700
Could we just drop
the Arabic amenities

826
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:42,400
and get right down
to the case?

827
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,900
I have two million dollars here.

828
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,500
Did I hear you correctly?

829
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,800
Two million?

830
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,600
My friend,
you could not have come...

831
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,700
at a more opportune time.

832
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,200
It looks like you're
about a billion short here.

833
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,000
Actually, all we really need
is a room for the night.

834
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,400
My house is yours.

835
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,600
But I think I can help
with laundering the money.

836
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:03,400
Look, we form
a limited partnership.

837
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,700
I've got all the papers here.

838
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,600
It is so simple.

839
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:12,500
First we exchange your dollars
for Brazilian cruzeiros.

840
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,700
They are impossible to trace.

841
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,500
With the Brazilian cruzeiros,
we ship out rocket launchers...

842
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,400
to the Contras.

843
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,500
The Contras have disbanded.

844
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,000
Right. Right.

845
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,600
All right.

846
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,400
How about
we trade your dollars...

847
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,700
for German deutsche marks?

848
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,300
The rates are excellent
this week.

849
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,700
We form
a Panamanian corporation...

850
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,200
and sell mortars
to the Cubans in Angola.

851
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:37,000
The Cubans are out of Angola.

852
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,100
The Russians
are out of Afghanistan.

853
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,200
You're gonna love this:
We trade for Escudos...

854
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:45,800
and sell exocet missiles
to Lithuania, huh?

855
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,500
Oh, who am I kidding?

856
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,900
They are stone broke.

857
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,300
Ah! The P.L.O.

858
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,200
Don't tell me.
They recognized Israel.

859
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:56,600
Goddamn it!

860
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,500
Nowadays, you can't
give away anything...

861
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,400
to the Colombian drug cartel.

862
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,800
Sam, you got to
help me, please!

863
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:06,200
Faisal, all we need
is a bed.

864
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:10,300
I just need
to prime the pump.

865
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:25,900
I think I should send telex
to my ex-wife...

866
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:29,900
I've finally found an apartment
with a fireplace.

867
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,300
We've got to change
that money...

868
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:35,700
maybe go to Switzerland,
if we can get there.

869
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:38,200
I want to go someplace warm.

870
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:41,400
Wonder who got
the gold toilet seats.

871
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,100
You know, I think
I know a girl in Paris...

872
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:49,900
who could help us
clean the money.

873
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:52,200
You haven't been to Paris
in seven years.

874
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,100
How do you know
where she lives?

875
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:58,300
The nightclub had more
than one phone, Sam.

876
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,900
You little devil, you.

877
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,400
You want to see something?

878
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,300
What?

879
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,700
Look at this.

880
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,700
What time is it?

881
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:18,900
Seven A.M.

882
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,800
I think we're surrounded.

883
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:37,200
Hello, Faisal.

884
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:48,000
I haven't seen you
since Nicaragua.

885
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,700
Oh, no.

886
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,200
Oh, yeah.

887
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,600
No point in saying
good-bye to Faisal.

888
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,900
What he doesn't know
can't hurt us.

889
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,300
Are you serious?

890
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:14,700
Yeah.

891
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,700
I see your phone's
been disconnected.

892
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,700
Have you been doing
any entertaining lately?

893
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,800
It's like looking for
a needle in a haystack.

894
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:18,000
Hey, Sam, there is something
I've got to tell you.

895
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:19,700
That guy in the subway?

896
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:20,900
Yeah, what about him?

897
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,300
He was my control.

898
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:26,700
Come again, now.

899
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:29,900
In the states, six years,
he ran me.

900
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,900
Wait a minute.
Whoa, Nelly, here.

901
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:35,300
You're losing me.

902
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:38,700
You mean the guy in the subway
was really Sobel?

903
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,600
Yes, sir.

904
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,300
Jesus Christ. Sobel.

905
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,600
Look, you're America.
I'm Russia.

906
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,500
This is Sobel.

907
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:51,200
1969, Sobel flies a U-2
over Russia...

908
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,000
where he gets shot down...

909
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,900
- So they turn him.
- They put a beard on him...

910
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:58,200
and send him back to
the States to make a network.

911
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:59,500
So he's in the States.

912
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,100
Why doesn't he blow the whistle?
Why does he stay commie?

913
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,100
He is not a commie.
He's a yuppie.

914
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,700
They paid him,
probably very well.

915
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:11,400
Then, when I got arrested,
he went underground.

916
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:13,000
I never knew where.

917
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,100
I think I know where.

918
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:17,100
I think he was
an economics professor...

919
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:19,100
at Texas A&M.

920
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,100
I saw it
in a Fort Worth paper.

921
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,600
He's supposed to
have been kidnapped.

922
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:30,200
Well, then the guys in Moscow
got this brainstorm...

923
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,900
how they could recycle him,
bring him back to Russia...

924
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:38,200
and send him home as Sobel...

925
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,500
to start all over.

926
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,900
You know, it almost happened.

927
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,300
Son of a bitch.

928
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,300
I saw him
at the Aeroflot counter.

929
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:49,100
He was standing in line,
rolling his head like this.

930
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,100
He was on his way to Russia.

931
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:53,200
He was gonna go back,
then turn around...

932
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:54,500
come back to the United States
as Sobel...

933
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:57,600
a big hero.

934
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,400
There was someone running Sobel.

935
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:03,700
I never knew who,
just his code name... Donald.

936
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,600
Did you ever meet Donald?

937
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,000
I had to memorize
his phone number.

938
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,400
Never used it.

939
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,300
Sobel used to joke...

940
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:15,800
that Donald had what you call
a sweet tooth.

941
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,100
Why are you
telling me this now?

942
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,900
I don't know,
but it feels great.

943
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:23,200
Whoever told Elliot
to have me wasted...

944
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,400
because I screwed up
the trade...

945
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,100
knew that Sobel
was a double agent...

946
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,300
and liked it like that.

947
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:33,300
Going in
the right direction.

948
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:39,100
Hey, take this, will you?

949
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,900
Oh, man.

950
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,800
I'm getting too old
for this.

951
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,900
Sit down, please.

952
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,700
Now, what I would like...

953
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:18,600
is a hot, black coffee...

954
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,900
and something to eat.

955
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,800
Ein schwartzen kaffee
und ein sandwich...

956
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,200
fur den herren, bitte.

957
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,700
Mike, what you got?

958
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,600
They got common market
passports.

959
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,900
The old guy who made them
is so shook up...

960
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:33,400
he can't remember
what names he put on them.

961
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:35,500
I got the cut-up
passport photo negatives here...

962
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,000
plus phony credit cards.

963
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:40,500
Credit cards.
Get on the credit cards...

964
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,400
and piece those negs together.

965
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,200
I got a source says
they stayed with him...

966
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,700
while you sewed up Berlin.

967
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,500
Like to talk to your source.

968
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,100
He says he doesn't know
what time they left his place.

969
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,800
No. I said I'd like to
talk to your source.

970
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:57,700
Anyway, I found
a ticket agent in Frankfurt...

971
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,100
who says that he thinks
he sold them...

972
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,200
two train tickets to Strasbourg.

973
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
But he didn't stop them,
because he thought...

974
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:08,000
he was looking for
two clean-shaven guys.

975
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,800
Great.

976
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,800
They're in France.

977
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:14,200
Damn mustache.

978
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,000
I don't get why
they're sticking together.

979
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:18,700
They'd be harder to find
if they split up.

980
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,300
Grigori.

981
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,300
Forgive my intrusion, Elliot...

982
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:33,100
but I believe we share
a common embarrassment.

983
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I hope you will
allow us to sit in.

984
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,300
As you know...

985
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:58,200
I am missing an important
gray attache case.

986
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:03,600
Let us combine our resources
in the name of progress.

987
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:08,000
Well, it's... it's a brave
new world, isn't it, boys?

988
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:12,400
We believe our two runaways
are headed for Paris.

989
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,600
Doesn't make sense, Grigori.

990
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,300
Boyd's never been in France.
He doesn't know word one.

991
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:19,000
But Grushenko
knows it quite well.

992
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:21,200
He worked at Unesco for us...

993
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:24,500
before we transferred him
to Washington.

994
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,000
Right.

995
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,800
Pack it up.

996
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,600
Wrong.

997
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,800
Excuse me. Pardon me.

998
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:16,800
Pardon.

999
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,500
Out of the way, please.

1000
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:48,900
What now?

1001
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:49,900
Get off.

1002
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:51,400
Are you kidding?

1003
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:52,900
You want to go back
to Berlin?

1004
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:05,300
I'm going to freeze.

1005
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:09,200
I guess this is
your idea of fun, huh?

1006
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,700
I knew they'd wind up
on phony credit cards.

1007
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:15,300
Yes.

1008
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:19,500
He came in just before
closing time...

1009
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:22,100
and bought a heavy overcoat.

1010
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
The sleeves
were a little too long...

1011
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:27,800
but he was in a hurry
and he said he didn't mind.

1012
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,200
I told him that
the alterations...

1013
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,700
What about the other man?

1014
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:32,500
Show him the next picture.

1015
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,900
This guy... did he sign
the credit card?

1016
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,400
Let me see.

1017
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:41,700
Yeah.

1018
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:44,300
I think that is the man.

1019
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,700
So they haven't
laundered the money.

1020
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,100
This is good?

1021
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:50,000
This is very good.

1022
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:52,800
They are in Paris.

1023
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,700
Thanks again for the coat.

1024
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:05,900
Yeah.

1025
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,100
It's nice to be alive,
Mr. Boyd, eh?

1026
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:09,200
Oh, I don't know.

1027
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:11,000
Did you ever talk to anybody
who was dead?

1028
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Talking about the dead,
President Johnson said...

1029
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,500
Mr. Grushenko, I don't care
about President Johnson...

1030
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,400
or Magic Johnson
or Howard Johnson.

1031
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,300
May I put a thought
in your head?

1032
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,500
Where are we
gonna sleep tonight?

1033
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,400
Patience.

1034
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,800
Et voila!

1035
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:32,500
C'est tellement bon
de te voir.

1036
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,300
Mais quelle beaute.
Quelle beaute!

1037
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,600
Comment tu vas?

1038
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:41,400
I'm sorry.

1039
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:42,600
Bonsoir.

1040
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:45,600
Natasha Grimaud, Sam Boyd.

1041
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,700
Enchantee.

1042
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,700
Hello.

1043
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:50,200
Nobody followed you?

1044
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:52,200
No. I don't think so.

1045
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,100
Good. What about the hotel?

1046
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:57,500
I made a reservation
at the Esmeralda.

1047
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:00,000
I put it on my credit card,
as you told me.

1048
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:00,900
Tres sage.

1049
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:03,300
I think I brought
everything you wanted...

1050
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:07,300
100,000 francs cash
from my savings.

1051
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:11,400
On y va, hein?

1052
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:12,300
Allez.

1053
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,500
We're in business, Sam.

1054
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,200
As I feared.

1055
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,200
How do they know
where she lives?

1056
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:28,400
I'll explain it to you later.

1057
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,100
They're not interested in you.

1058
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,800
You're just going home, eh?

1059
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,400
Simple as that, OK?

1060
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,900
Hey, how do we get
in touch with you?

1061
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,000
Why don't we meet
tomorrow morning somewhere?

1062
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:40,200
Tomorrow, 9:00...

1063
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:41,600
at the Monument
de la Deportation.

1064
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,700
It's just across
from your hotel.

1065
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,100
I know it.

1066
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,300
Hey, hey.
You watch that case, OK?

1067
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,200
I think I got it.

1068
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,100
Bonne nuit. Et attention.

1069
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:53,200
Attention a toi. Bye.

1070
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:55,600
Natasha.

1071
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:57,300
She doesn't look Russian to me.

1072
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:58,600
She's French.

1073
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,900
Her mother was crazy
for "War and Peace"...

1074
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,900
so they named her Natasha.

1075
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,800
She seems pretty keen on you.

1076
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,500
Yeah.

1077
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:10,000
She in the orchestra?

1078
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,800
In the KGB? No.

1079
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:15,300
She works for
one of those big Japanese firms.

1080
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:18,000
She's the biggest capitalist
you ever met.

1081
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,300
I think she's OK.

1082
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:27,800
I don't know
how good an idea it is...

1083
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:29,700
to turn over two million dollars
to a capitalist.

1084
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,000
You want the money changed,
don't you?

1085
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:32,000
- Yeah.
- I think she can do it.

1086
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,200
Oh, you think she can do it.
I must be nuts.

1087
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,200
I just turned over
our whole nest egg...

1088
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:38,200
to some blast from the past
of yours.

1089
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,300
What do you think?

1090
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:51,800
Yeah.

1091
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:54,000
Hey, you look like Ringo Starr.

1092
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,600
Are you going to
stay like that?

1093
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:00,400
Time for a new beginning, Sam.

1094
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:02,300
You sound very chipper.

1095
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:05,000
Oh, I know.
It's the little chicky.

1096
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Yeah.

1097
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:07,900
Did your wife know about her?

1098
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,900
Yeah, she knew about her.

1099
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,700
It was a long time ago.

1100
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:16,800
It was a very special thing.

1101
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,100
You were robbing the cradle.

1102
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,500
Did she know
about your wife?

1103
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,500
Do you believe in anything?

1104
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:28,400
Yeah.

1105
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:00,700
Where's your girlfriend
with our suitcase?

1106
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:01,600
She'll come.

1107
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,000
Yeah, well, she's late.

1108
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,900
There she is.

1109
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:06,800
Sorry. Sorry to be late.

1110
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,800
Ca va?

1111
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:11,400
Where's our suitcase?

1112
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:12,300
Safe.

1113
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,800
You look different.

1114
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:16,000
Excuse me,
but where is the suitcase?

1115
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:16,900
Safe.

1116
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:19,100
Stop! Don't talk to her
like that.

1117
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:20,300
Listen, in that case...

1118
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:21,900
is two million dollars
in numbered bills.

1119
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:23,000
Two million dollars?

1120
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,800
We have to change those bills.

1121
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:26,700
If you can help us, great.

1122
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:29,100
If you cannot, I understand.

1123
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,500
It's not a problem, all right?

1124
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,700
It's easy.

1125
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,900
I can get the money...

1126
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:34,200
into one of
our swiss accounts.

1127
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:37,400
Two million is nothing.
I telex money all the time.

1128
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:40,600
By the time they trace it,
it's gone.

1129
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:42,400
But I can't do is get it out.

1130
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,600
For that, you must go to Zurich.

1131
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,000
Can you give me accreditation?

1132
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,400
- Do you have a passport?
- Yeah.

1133
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:49,600
Yes, I can give you
the paperwork...

1134
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:53,500
and the access code to go
with the name on your passport.

1135
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:55,700
They will give you the money
in any currency you like.

1136
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:57,100
But why you? Why not me?

1137
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:59,400
You're going to travel
on your passport?

1138
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:00,500
You've been signing
your name all over.

1139
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:01,900
All right, go to Zurich.

1140
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,600
Go on. Go.

1141
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:04,800
Here is the address.

1142
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:05,800
OK.

1143
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:11,600
Take care of him.

1144
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,600
- Trust me.
- Trust you?

1145
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:24,300
I don't know
if I'm making a mistake or not.

1146
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:26,800
Now I'm turning over
$2 million to a communist.

1147
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:29,400
I have to get back.

1148
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:31,800
What about the confirmation
of the money to Zurich?

1149
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:35,200
Meet me tonight at
the Cafe de la Jatte at 9:00.

1150
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:36,100
Cafe Jack? Where's that?

1151
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:39,100
You have all day to find it.

1152
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:42,200
Great. I'll go up
on the Eiffel Tower...

1153
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,100
and look for it.

1154
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:31,800
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the summit...

1155
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,200
of the Eiffel Tower.

1156
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:36,100
You are now 300 meters
above the ground.

1157
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Elevators depart every 5 minutes
for level two.

1158
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,300
Would monsieur
care for an aperitif?

1159
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,200
Not right now, thank you.

1160
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,200
Well?

1161
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:29,800
Aren't you going
to say good evening?

1162
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:31,700
I'm going to say
good evening...

1163
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,700
right after you tell me
the money made it to Zurich.

1164
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,600
The money made it to Zurich.

1165
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:37,600
Good evening.

1166
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,000
Good evening.

1167
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:44,400
You look very nice.

1168
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:48,900
I see you're wearing
Lavender Ice by Maxine Grey.

1169
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:51,200
Bravo. Connaisseur.

1170
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:54,100
I like doing
a little industrial espionage.

1171
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
May I ask you something?

1172
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,400
Depends.

1173
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:03,800
Pyiotr was in prison
in the United States.

1174
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:05,400
What is he doing here?

1175
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:07,100
Well, if he didn't
want you to know...

1176
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:08,700
I'm sure as hell
not going to tell you.

1177
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,700
Well, if you don't tell me...

1178
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,300
I shall make a scene...

1179
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:13,600
then I will
send a fax to Zurich...

1180
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,400
cancel the transfer
of the money...

1181
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:17,300
and then I will go...

1182
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,800
to the offices
of "Time" magazine...

1183
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:21,200
and tell them
all about this.

1184
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:23,500
Well...

1185
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:28,100
I work for the government,
kind of a part-timer.

1186
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,600
I was supposed to trade
Grushenko for an American.

1187
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:33,200
Things got out of hand...

1188
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:34,600
and we were left out
in the cold.

1189
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:36,800
You were going to
send him back to Russia?

1190
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:38,500
It wasn't my idea.
I was just...

1191
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:40,800
- Following orders.
- Following orders.

1192
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
You and Pyiotr lvanovich,
the pair of you...

1193
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:48,600
do you know what you are?

1194
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,300
Dinozaurs.

1195
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:52,400
Dinosaurs?

1196
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:53,800
Dinosaurs.

1197
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,300
With your spy games,
you are extinct today.

1198
01:16:58,100 --> 01:17:00,500
Russia, America... who cares?

1199
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:03,800
You will kill each other,
and it will be for nothing.

1200
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:06,200
In two years, all of Europe,
including Germany...

1201
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,200
will be one big corporation.

1202
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,700
What's good for Toshiba
is good for the world.

1203
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:13,000
Is this the kind of thing
you talk to Grushenko about?

1204
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:15,100
Yes, before your people
arrested him.

1205
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,000
You know, I think I will
have a drink after all.

1206
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:21,500
Uh, do you have Storka?

1207
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:22,500
Mais oui.

1208
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:23,600
Thank you.

1209
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,600
OK, nobody move.

1210
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,800
Let's just keep it cool, fellas.

1211
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,000
What do you think
you are doing?

1212
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:46,800
We ran out of credit cards...

1213
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:49,200
so we decided
to tail you instead.

1214
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,600
Who's she?

1215
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,400
Grushenko's daughter.

1216
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,200
Where's your father?

1217
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:10,600
Where's your father?

1218
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:12,800
All right.

1219
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,300
Just take it easy.

1220
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,700
Now, we'll all go somewhere...

1221
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:18,100
and lay our cards
on the table, huh?

1222
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:23,000
Grigori, apres vous.

1223
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:27,900
Yeah?

1224
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:30,500
Who do you like in the fifth?

1225
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:32,900
Sam, we've got your hotel
staked out.

1226
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:33,800
Elliot.

1227
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,700
The girl
is Grushenko's daughter.

1228
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,500
We've got her, too.

1229
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:41,300
His daughter?

1230
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:45,900
Jesus.

1231
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:54,200
OK, what's the deal?

1232
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,800
The deal is...

1233
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:04,700
Grigori wants the money
and Grushenko...

1234
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,600
we still want Sobel...

1235
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:09,900
The girl wants to go
back to work...

1236
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:13,600
and you want to go home
and forget this whole thing.

1237
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,400
You know where he is?

1238
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:17,300
Of course. Where are you?

1239
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,700
I'd hate to see
anything happen to her, Sam.

1240
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:21,400
She seems like
a real nice girl.

1241
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,900
OK, OK, it's a deal.

1242
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,800
Someplace nice and quiet.

1243
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:28,900
No way, Jose.
Someplace nice and public.

1244
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,400
Give me your phone number.

1245
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:32,300
Come on, Sam.

1246
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:34,300
Give me your
fucking phone number!

1247
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:37,400
4-306-9921.

1248
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:41,400
Hey!

1249
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:44,800
Damn it!

1250
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:48,900
His special thing.

1251
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:51,800
Where is that commie cocker?

1252
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,500
Over there!

1253
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:28,500
Monsieur Henri Deplis...

1254
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:31,400
please contact the nearest
white courtesy telephone.

1255
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:33,000
Monsieur Henri Deplis.

1256
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:36,700
Monsieur Deplis?

1257
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:39,300
Oui. C'est Henri Deplis.

1258
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:40,700
Did it go all right?

1259
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:42,200
I've been paging every flight.

1260
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:43,600
Where are you?

1261
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:46,500
Natasha and I
are on top of the Eiffel Tower.

1262
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:49,200
Meet us here for lunch
at twelve sharp, OK?

1263
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:51,200
Did you get the money?

1264
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:53,000
Yeah. Almost all of it.

1265
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:55,000
Great. Hey, we're going
to celebrate.

1266
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:56,100
Are you OK?

1267
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:57,100
Trust me.

1268
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,500
Elliot.

1269
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:17,900
Goddamn it.

1270
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:20,200
Where the hell are you?

1271
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:22,200
You meet me
on top the Eiffel Tower...

1272
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:23,500
at twelve noon.

1273
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,000
Grushenko will be there.

1274
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,900
You have your boys in place.

1275
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:28,300
There's a grey telephone there.

1276
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:31,000
When Grushenko comes up
in elevator "A"...

1277
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,700
one of them will call you.

1278
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:34,500
That's when you
send the girl down...

1279
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:38,100
in elevator "B" by herself
so I can see her.

1280
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:39,400
You got that?

1281
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,800
Has he got the money?

1282
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,800
He's got it.
Let me talk to her.

1283
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:46,600
Sam?

1284
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,200
When this is over...

1285
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,400
I want you to renew
your subscription...

1286
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:51,400
in "Time" magazine.

1287
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,800
You understand what I'm saying?

1288
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,500
Yes, I understand.

1289
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:57,800
And believe me, I'm very sorry.

1290
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,200
Don't talk to...

1291
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,400
Enough, OK?

1292
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:05,500
We will see Pyiotr lvanovich
in exactly one hour...

1293
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:07,400
Ten minutes.

1294
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:11,300
Or she won't need an elevator
to get off the Tower, correct?

1295
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:12,400
Yeah, correct.

1296
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:35,900
We got him. Move it!

1297
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:51,300
All right.

1298
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:53,900
Yeah, I'm now standing by. Over.

1299
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:45,300
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is level two.

1300
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:47,200
There are souvenirs,
a restaurant...

1301
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:50,400
and those wishing to view
the summit of the Tower...

1302
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,800
must change elevators here.

1303
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:01,100
This elevator
is for the summit only.

1304
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,700
Cet ascenseur pour
le sommet seulement.

1305
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:08,900
180, monsieur.

1306
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:13,600
Non, ca va. Ca va.

1307
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:14,400
Merci.

1308
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,600
Sommet.

1309
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:08,900
Ladies and gentlemen...

1310
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,900
this is the summit
of the Eiffel Tower.

1311
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:15,400
You are now 300 meters
above the ground.

1312
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:24,600
Jaffe.

1313
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:27,600
Elliot? It's Tony.
He's on his way.

1314
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:49,900
Allez. Tire toi.

1315
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,300
Folks, I'm sorry.

1316
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:53,100
You're gonna have to use
the elevator on the other side.

1317
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,300
L'autre cote.
L'autre cote. Merci.

1318
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:11,000
Papa!

1319
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:44,400
Jesus!

1320
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:45,900
The other lift!

1321
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:49,000
It'll never get here.

1322
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:53,700
You asked me before
what I believe in.

1323
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:55,200
I believe in you, pal.

1324
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:01,900
Aw, shit.

1325
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:03,000
Aw, Christ.

1326
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,500
Where is Natasha?

1327
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:06,100
They grabbed her.

1328
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,500
This is the only thing
I could think of...

1329
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,400
to get her back.

1330
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:10,800
She's OK?

1331
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:13,300
Yeah, she's OK, fine.
So are you.

1332
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,700
Come on, stand up.

1333
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:18,500
At least you'd better be fine
after all we've been through.

1334
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:37,200
Elliot?

1335
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:48,900
We've got to have lunch.

1336
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:52,200
We're stuck here
until they clear out.

1337
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:08,500
Monsieur.

1338
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:10,400
I have a reservation.
John Jones.

1339
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,500
But of course, Monsieur Jones.

1340
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:14,400
May I take your coat?

1341
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:15,400
No.

1342
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:16,300
This way, please.

1343
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:39,800
Will you gentlemen
care for an aperitif?

1344
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:42,200
Uh, do you have Starka,
very cold?

1345
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:43,100
Of course.

1346
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:44,600
Two of those, please.

1347
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:47,500
Make it doubles.
And a telephone, please.

1348
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:48,400
Yes, sir.

1349
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:52,500
How do you know she's OK?

1350
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:56,700
They wouldn't be standing around
like that if she wasn't.

1351
01:29:58,300 --> 01:30:01,500
Why didn't you tell me she was
your kid, for Pete's sake?

1352
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:04,400
You must have been 12 years old
when you were married.

1353
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:05,600
Trust me?

1354
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:08,000
I was going to.

1355
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:10,900
I think we were talking
about someplace warm.

1356
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:16,500
Beautiful beaches,
temperate climate...

1357
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:20,400
Iovely fruit, no extradition.

1358
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:23,200
Our country 'tis of we.

1359
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:25,300
Sounds good.

1360
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:29,000
There goes Mike, the creep.

1361
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:31,400
What would you give to know...

1362
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:33,000
what they're talking
about down there?

1363
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:34,600
I know
what they're talking about.

1364
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:37,000
KGB's still trying
to recycle Sobel...

1365
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:40,800
but I think
I can take care of that.

1366
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,300
What's going on?

1367
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:08,900
Remember Donald?

1368
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,000
Sweet tooth?

1369
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,300
I hope
he picks up his messages.

1370
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:20,000
Do svidaniya.

1371
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:22,300
Do svidaniya.
