1
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,556
    Here for the next month.

2
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:54,993
      It's weird looking.

3
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,428
      It's kind of weird.

4
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:00,599
         Rocking boat.

5
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:01,500
              God.

6
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:04,870
      You have suitcases?

7
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:10,976
            Thanks.

8
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,419
    Could it be any hotter?

9
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:23,388
        Ugh, it's gross.

10
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,357
    I just got bit already.

11
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:26,992
      So this is Thailand.

12
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:30,662
       It looks amazing.

13
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,631
    We're really out in the
    sticks here, aren't we?

14
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:36,935
      This is gonna be an
   unforgettable experience.

15
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:41,606
 Yeah, well, after a train ride
 to a cab ride to a boat ride,

16
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,775
       that was quite an
     experience in itself.

17
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,344
   Don't be such a sourpuss.

18
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:47,446
  Come on, this place is huge.

19
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:50,349
   Yeah, but the words freaky
   and run down come to mind.

20
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:53,051
    You know what, I'm just
  relieved it's not a hut, OK?

21
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,386
     Why would it be a hut?

22
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:59,524
      It's Southeast Asia,
       teaching children.

23
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:00,625
       I expected a hut.

24
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,427
    This isn't much better.

25
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:03,128
         Come on, sis.

26
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,029
       We're in Thailand.

27
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,664
    We're saving the world.

28
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,399
           Enjoy it.

29
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:09,501
  All right, how about we just
  go inside like normal people

30
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:10,736
           would do?

31
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:12,771
    OK, we're teaching small
     children the alphabet.

32
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:13,839
    We're not curing cancer.

33
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,140
         Let's not get
      ahead of ourselves.

34
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,650
             Jeez.

35
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:26,651
      What were you doing?

36
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:27,986
            Nothing.

37
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:30,589
    Just admiring that cool
    dollhouse looking thing.

38
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:31,990
      It's actually called
        a spirit house,

39
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,658
and it's sacred in Thai culture.

40
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,026
How am I supposed to know that?

41
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,963
 What's that supposed to mean?

42
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:40,699
      Ah, Alex, ignorance
        truly is bliss.

43
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:42,667
      Wow, I'm so glad I'm
    not related to you two.

44
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:43,568
             Wait.

45
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,469
        I don't get it.

46
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,443
              OK.

47
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:52,778
          Oh, come on.

48
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,479
      What are you doing?

49
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:55,680
             Stuck.

50
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,015
        Probably because
     it's a piece of crap.

51
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,517
      Come on, let me see.

52
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:05,857
              Uh.

53
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:06,992
              Oh!

54
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:08,760
       What do you know?

55
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,463
Not so ignorant after all, huh?

56
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:13,799
  I swear, I'm gonna smack her
   at some point this summer.

57
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,934
  Well, wait until she's drunk
   so it doesn't hurt as bad.

58
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,135
     Love you Al, I swear.

59
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,074
              OK.

60
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,545
              Ugh.

61
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:34,553
    Hey, don't judge a book
      by its cover, right?

62
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:36,955
It's not completely unfortunate.

63
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:40,892
       Wow, it's so old.

64
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:41,827
     How old do you think?

65
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,061
   Like, thousands of years?

66
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,095
         I don't know.

67
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:44,996
              See?

68
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:48,133
    I told you it's amazing.

69
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,969
     Just like the woman at
    the housing office said.

70
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,971
I call dibs on the biggest room!

71
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:53,972
             Noted.

72
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:58,043
  Well, it only is fair, since
   I never doubted the place.

73
00:07:58,045 --> 00:08:00,479
       Like I said, it's
     not completely shitty.

74
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:01,947
     You said unfortunate.

75
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,882
      But I meant shitty.

76
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:06,218
   OK, girls, do you want to
   see the rest of the rooms?

77
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,558
    I'm just going to remind
  you guys that I called dibs.

78
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,628
        I don't remember
       that conversation.

79
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,964
Jules, do you remember anything
   about a dibs being called?

80
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:19,965
           Ah, uh-uh.

81
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,633
              No.

82
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:24,669
     You know, I-- I don't
 remember anything about that.

83
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,704
    You guys are hilarious.

84
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:27,973
             Sorry.

85
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,984
     I don't know if we're
    supposed to be up here.

86
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:39,885
      I'm sure it's fine.

87
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,163
              Ooh.

88
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,610
      Guys, look at this.

89
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:07,746
     Looks like traditional
    Thai couch or something.

90
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:08,647
             Comfy.

91
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:21,826
             Whoa.

92
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
      It looks really old.

93
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,142
         Is that gold?

94
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:38,310
            No way.

95
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:40,011
      It's probably paint.

96
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,880
Look, it's chipping right there.

97
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,348
         It's so cold.

98
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,690
      It's really pretty.

99
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:54,059
 Well, if it's an antique, you
 shouldn't be touching it, Al.

100
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:56,628
         You're right.

101
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,329
            Really?

102
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,336
    Uh, OK, I'm a little bit
 creeped out by this, so let's

103
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:07,906
 I don't want to be responsible
for breaking an ancient statue,

104
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:09,040
              OK?

105
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:11,376
       All right, girls,
        what's the plan?

106
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:14,813
  Now, we can go get food, go
  to town, get tequila shots.

107
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:16,681
             What?

108
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:17,315
             Sleep.

109
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:18,617
              OK.

110
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:19,918
          Sleep it is.

111
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,885
            Come on.

112
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,663
         Oh, hey, baby.

113
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,031
          Nice shirt.

114
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:33,932
      What are you up to?

115
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,767
        Just waking up.

116
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:39,070
Checking in on my little lover.

117
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,405
  What time is it over there?

118
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:41,873
             Noon.

119
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,408
              Oh.

120
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,277
   I see you're putting your
 summer TAing off to good use.

121
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,680
   Well, you know, the whole
reason I'm becoming a professor

122
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,949
  is so I can have the summers
     off, not have to wake

123
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,217
    up at the crack of dawn.

124
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,022
      I remember somebody
      telling me Thailand

125
00:10:57,024 --> 00:11:01,726
is an amazing and magical land.

126
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:02,861
    So how are the sisters?

127
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:03,762
       Crazy and crazier?

128
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:45,964
           Hey guys.

129
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:47,098
     What's for breakfast?

130
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,999
         I'm starving.

131
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,203
             What?

132
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:53,972
 There's no food in this house.

133
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:55,073
              Yep.

134
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:58,042
All we could find was this tea.

135
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:58,943
              Hmm.

136
00:12:58,945 --> 00:12:59,878
        All right, then.

137
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,478
    Who wants to go to town?

138
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,121
         What the heck?

139
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,489
  It's probably just the wind.

140
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,858
              Sir?

141
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,092
              Sir?

142
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:49,961
          Are you OK?

143
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,831
       He looks comatose.

144
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,300
     Except he's standing.

145
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:05,043
          Uh, hold on.

146
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,511
      We don't speak Thai.

147
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:07,412
              Oh.

148
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:08,847
              Um.

149
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,081
   Well, sorry to bother you.

150
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,983
        Many apologies.

151
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:14,285
           Is he OK?

152
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:15,186
             Yeah.

153
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,387
             Yeah.

154
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:19,090
        He just likes to
     wander off sometimes.

155
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:19,858
       Again, very sorry.

156
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,959
           Thank you.

157
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,467
     Well, that was creepy.

158
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:32,136
  But I'm hungry, so let's go.

159
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:35,240
      Wow, someone's good
     at compartmentalizing.

160
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:36,474
       You have no idea.

161
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,352
Ooh, let's stop here for a sec.

162
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:50,321
  I want to look at something.

163
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:53,491
              Hmm.

164
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:54,392
            Purses.

165
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,501
  You don't even wear jewelry.

166
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,169
         When in Rome.

167
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:06,237
       Is this a dragon?

168
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,241
         Oh, um, hello.

169
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:15,513
    How much does this cost?

170
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,949
            90 baht.

171
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:19,117
   It's about $3.00 American.

172
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:20,018
             What?

173
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,252
              OK.

174
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:25,623
      Um, Al, what do you
       think of this bag?

175
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,092
      Um, yeah, that bag--
   that bag's cool, I think.

176
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,460
            I guess.

177
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:30,361
              OK.

178
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:31,596
          I'll buy it.

179
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,669
     So, girls, what's the
     plan for tonight, huh?

180
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:40,939
  I mean, we only have a week
    before the work starts.

181
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:41,706
           Thank you.

182
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,242
        And by the work,
        you mean helping

183
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:46,678
    lovely, helpless little
      children and the joy

184
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,546
  that comes with that, right?

185
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,048
          Yes, that is
     exactly what I meant.

186
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:50,949
             Mmhmm.

187
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,283
              Yes.

188
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,284
      What about you, Al?

189
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,352
           Um, what?

190
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:56,054
           The club.

191
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:59,357
       I think those guys
       are following us.

192
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,659
 That's a weird subject change.

193
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:02,560
         No, seriously.

194
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:06,230
      I saw them when you
    were buying your purse.

195
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,399
       Hey, you guys want
       something or what?

196
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,573
          Yeah, right?

197
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:16,507
        Oh, come on, Al.

198
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:17,408
          Don't worry.

199
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,344
   I'm sure they're harmless.

200
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:20,511
           Whatever.

201
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:24,115
 OK, so, um, change, thank you?

202
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:26,150
      So, what's the vote?

203
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,418
           Thank you.

204
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,319
          Vote, vote?

205
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,287
     Yeah, club sounds fun.

206
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:30,188
            Tonight?

207
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,622
              OK.

208
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:34,592
       Yeah, we'll dance,
   drink, make bad decisions.

209
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,127
It'll be like a Tuesday for you.

210
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,628
         Oh, hilarious.

211
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,231
      OK, I'm in, too, but
      just as an observer,

212
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:42,367
  because I have a boyfriend.

213
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:44,068
       Well, all the more
        reason to drink.

214
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:44,769
            Uh-huh.

215
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:45,670
             Lame.

216
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,644
    I seriously think Shane
      might propose soon.

217
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:27,545
              Eew.

218
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,547
       That sounds awful.

219
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,682
 No, it's-- it's a good thing.

220
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,718
  Would you actually say yes?

221
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,388
    We've been together four
      years, so, you know.

222
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,589
             Jeez.

223
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,525
       I think my longest
       relationship was--

224
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:44,295
  does five weeks even count?

225
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:45,530
         You guys ready
       for another round?

226
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:47,165
             Yeah.

227
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,566
  Oh, we should get that big,
    um, that fishbowl thing

228
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,767
 with, like, the giant straws.

229
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:50,802
              Yes!

230
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:52,103
              Yes!

231
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:54,472
       That sounds like a
     hangover in a bucket.

232
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,641
        That sounds like
        a bucket of fun.

233
00:17:56,643 --> 00:18:01,145
        A bucket of fun?

234
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:01,646
        Fine, fishbowl.

235
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:09,220
     It sounds amazing, and
     you're gonna love it.

236
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,662
     Can we drink all that?

237
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:19,130
           Of course.

238
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:20,865
        You gonna let me
        buy you a drink?

239
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:23,568
           Oh, hello.

240
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,203
    No, thank you, actually.

241
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:27,538
    My girlfriends and I are
 gonna do a fishbowl thing, so.

242
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,439
       Hey, hey, please.

243
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,142
   Let Colin take care of it.

244
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:32,210
     Really not a problem.

245
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:33,611
              Oh.

246
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,847
      Did he just refer to
  himself in the third person?

247
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:38,883
   OK, Colin, I'm sorry, but
    I'm just not interested.

248
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:41,219
     I might be interested.

249
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:42,320
            Rachel.

250
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:43,287
    Where are you guys from?

251
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,188
        America, right?

252
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,123
              Yes.

253
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:45,823
             Mm-hm.

254
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:47,525
       I fucking knew it.

255
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:49,727
What is it, go the Lakers, yeah?

256
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:52,630
       Yes, I'm American
     and I love the Lakers.

257
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:53,898
     You're from Michigan.

258
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,566
          Same thing.

259
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,668
        What-- what are
      you, like, British?

260
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,605
Yeah, I'm London born and bred.

261
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:02,440
        Gonna let me buy
      you a drink or not?

262
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:03,274
              No.

263
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:04,242
    I'm just not interested.

264
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:09,413
          Still there?

265
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:10,681
          Knock knock.

266
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,150
          Who's there?

267
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,885
     The guy you just made
       a dickhead out of.

268
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:14,785
        Thanks for that.

269
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:15,686
       Much appreciated.

270
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:19,590
              Wow.

271
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:22,360
        You're welcome!

272
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:24,262
    Honestly, who was that?

273
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,835
Rachel, do you see his friends?

274
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,873
   Yeah, they're super cute.

275
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,279
  I like the mature gentleman.

276
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:43,915
  No, those are the guys that
   were following us earlier.

277
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:44,782
             What?

278
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:47,818
          Oh my gosh.

279
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,953
      You guys are so bad.

280
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:50,588
       It's dark in here.

281
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,689
       It's hard to see.

282
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,424
Alex, are you sure that's them?

283
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:55,560
         I'm positive.

284
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:57,562
   Yes, it's definitely them!

285
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:58,829
        I'm going there.

286
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:00,298
 I'm going to go talk to them.

287
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,633
      Rachel, no, no, no!

288
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:03,634
             Rach!

289
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:04,535
          Oh, Rachel.

290
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:05,503
            Oh, God.

291
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:10,975
      Some girl's coming.

292
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,614
             Hello.

293
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:17,615
              Hi.

294
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:19,817
     You guys following us?

295
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:20,718
            Rachel.

296
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:25,656
     Give me some of that.

297
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:26,557
        Definitely not.

298
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,658
   Don't believe you, but OK.

299
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,894
        Are you a model?

300
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:30,962
          I could be.

301
00:20:30,964 --> 00:20:31,862
              BRB.

302
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:35,499
         Grab yourself.

303
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:36,434
      We're moving spots.

304
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:37,735
    Oh, good, we're leaving.

305
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,704
 No, like we are joining them.

306
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:40,605
              No.

307
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:41,005
             What?

308
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:42,540
              Yes.

309
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:46,310
    They're nice and they're
     cute and they're male.

310
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:47,878
       Did I mention that
        they were male?

311
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,681
  Do I need to remind you that
these cute, nice guys were also

312
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:52,583
       stalking us about,
      like, six hours ago?

313
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:53,684
 Rach, are you sure about this?

314
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:54,585
            Come on.

315
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,853
         Yes, I'm sure.

316
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:57,555
       They just thought
      that we were models.

317
00:20:57,557 --> 00:20:59,457
              Oh.

318
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:02,627
     I don't care what they
  think that we look like, OK?

319
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:05,396
      I have a boyfriend.

320
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:06,697
    Eew, god, look at them.

321
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:09,433
 They won't stop staring at us.

322
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:10,334
      They're not creepy.

323
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:11,636
        They're British.

324
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:14,038
      And that means that
     they are intelligent.

325
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,539
             Mm-hm.

326
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,807
              Yes.

327
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,676
     And besides that, you
       guys are not going

328
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:20,378
   to be ruining this for me.

329
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,315
   Do you know how long it's
  been since I've gotten laid?

330
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:25,449
             Yeah.

331
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,052
    A really long time, OK?

332
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:29,620
      So you have to take
     one for the team here.

333
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,454
        Come on, Jules.

334
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,022
            Please?

335
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:31,756
            Please?

336
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:32,723
          No, I'm not.

337
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:33,958
   I'm not going over there.

338
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,693
            God, no.

339
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:37,762
   I'll stay in my fishbowl.

340
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:41,999
     I didn't want to have
     to do this, but Vegas.

341
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:45,303
             2010.

342
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,974
   There was a swimming pool.

343
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:54,078
And there was an emergency room.

344
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,046
     That's what I thought.

345
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:56,414
           Oh my God.

346
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,783
       I saved your ass.

347
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:00,518
          You owe me.

348
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,420
      You fucking owe me.

349
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:03,321
             Fine.

350
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,655
           Fine, OK?

351
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:05,656
     But then this is over.

352
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:06,724
          We are even.
          You hear me?

353
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:07,625
          We're even!

354
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:08,359
             Even!

355
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:08,993
          Even Steven.

356
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,094
          Even Steven.

357
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:11,762
              Yes.

358
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:13,364
           All right.

359
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:14,065
           All right.

360
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:16,100
         Got the bowl.

361
00:22:16,102 --> 00:22:17,001
              Yes!

362
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,812
      Knew you'd be back.

363
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:31,549
    Oh, OK, back up, limey.

364
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:32,450
          Fine, fine.

365
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,400
         Slowly, babe.

366
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:50,401
           I'm drunk.

367
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:55,573
             Right.

368
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:56,874
        Watch your head.

369
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:00,878
             Whoa.

370
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:06,717
             Yeah.

371
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,530
     So this is the house.

372
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:20,531
           Old house.

373
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:21,132
           I like it.

374
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:35,813
           All right?

375
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:37,915
  Oh, yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

376
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:38,816
        It's all right.

377
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:39,950
              No.

378
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:41,485
         You don't have
       to play like them.

379
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:42,186
      We can just cuddle.

380
00:23:42,188 --> 00:23:43,487
              No.

381
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:47,958
        Um, see, I, um--

382
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,660
      I'm not gonna bite.

383
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:54,432
        I have, um-- you
        see-- oh my God!

384
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:56,066
             Shoot.

385
00:23:56,068 --> 00:24:00,738
     Hey, guys, do you have
    any drinks in the house?

386
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,639
             Uh-uh.

387
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:09,079
       No fucking drinks?

388
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:12,183
     No whiskey, no vodka?

389
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:13,651
   You got some ganja, right?

390
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:22,026
     No, we don't have any
      ganja in our house.

391
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:23,727
    Look, don't worry, yeah?

392
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:28,098
  Because if I put my hand in
   my back pocket-- oh, yes!

393
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:32,670
  Come on, get up, get on it.

394
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:33,637
      Three cheers, baby.

395
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:36,207
          Let's drink.

396
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:37,575
            Come on.

397
00:24:37,577 --> 00:24:39,543
            Come on.

398
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:40,845
       You're so pretty.

399
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:45,616
            For me?

400
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,720
             Drink.

401
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:50,855
         Knock it back.

402
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:53,858
      Ooh, knock it back!

403
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,192
       Yeah, baby, yeah!

404
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:00,698
           Good girl.

405
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,999
    Professional right here.

406
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:04,635
           Oh, yeah.

407
00:25:04,637 --> 00:25:06,237
          No, I-- no.

408
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:08,906
    I had a lot at the bar.

409
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:09,807
           Take some.

410
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:12,977
            Come on.

411
00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:13,878
       Come on, it's OK.

412
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,645
        What's in here?

413
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:15,546
            Alcohol.

414
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:18,082
         Just alcohol.

415
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:23,521
             Yeah!

416
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,765
  Aren't you gonna have some?

417
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:35,666
              No.

418
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:36,567
         I don't drink.

419
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:16,574
        Drin-- what the
      fuck are you doing?

420
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:19,610
       What the fuck are
       you doing, Julia?

421
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:21,245
     You're a crazy bitch.

422
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,614
       Stay away from me.

423
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,783
             Byron!

424
00:26:25,785 --> 00:26:27,217
          You're dead.

425
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:29,853
          You're dead!

426
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:31,155
    Don't you come near me.

427
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:32,856
    Don't you come near me.

428
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:34,158
     Fuck off away from me.

429
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,660
Fuck off away from me with that!

430
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:37,595
             Help!

431
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:38,796
             Byron!

432
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:41,298
             Byron!

433
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,301
       Stay away from me.

434
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,270
 Don't, please, please, don't.

435
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:47,271
     Don't-- don't do that.

436
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:48,205
     Don't do that, please.

437
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:49,106
       Stay away from me.

438
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,074
      What are you doing?

439
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:06,957
    You fucking crazy bitch!

440
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:14,198
             Help!

441
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:35,285
             Help!

442
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:39,990
              God!

443
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:40,891
      What are you doing?

444
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:41,792
            Please!

445
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:44,261
         Please, don't!

446
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:47,931
    Stop it, please stop it!

447
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:49,733
      What are you doing?

448
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:00,177
              No!

449
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,178
              No!

450
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:01,805
           Stay away.

451
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:05,943
         Please, sorry,
       I'm sorry, please.

452
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:07,878
         Please don't.

453
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,782
   Help me, please, help me.

454
00:29:11,784 --> 00:29:13,517
           Stay away.

455
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:15,486
           Stay away.

456
00:29:15,488 --> 00:29:17,421
            Help me!

457
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:19,456
         Someone help!

458
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:20,357
             Help!

459
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:27,765
 Please, please, please, don't.

460
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:28,966
              No!

461
00:29:28,968 --> 00:29:32,770
      No, no, no, no, no!

462
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:33,537
              Go!

463
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,239
              Go!

464
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:38,342
       Help, help, help!

465
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:39,243
            Look I--

466
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,973
         Someone help!

467
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,053
             Help!

468
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:25,088
             Help!

469
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:25,989
              No!

470
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:31,361
            Please!

471
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:35,332
             Help!

472
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,233
             Help!

473
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:42,906
Please, stop!

474
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:49,146
      What are you doing?

475
00:30:49,148 --> 00:30:51,548
              No!

476
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,917
      Stop, please, help!

477
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:54,918
             Stop!

478
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,415
  Alex, you're up before I am?

479
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:40,283
         I know, I'm as
      shocked as you are.

480
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,362
              Ugh.

481
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,031
I did not sleep well last night.

482
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:01,371
   I had the strangest dream.

483
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:04,474
      What kind of dream?

484
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:06,243
            Violent.

485
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:07,444
     Disgustingly violent.

486
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:17,320
Remind me never to drink from a
British man's flask ever again.

487
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:18,455
             Yeah.

488
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:19,756
        That feels like
       it was a mistake.

489
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:26,296
     I had a similar dream.

490
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:28,198
       It was disturbing.

491
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,233
        I killed Colin.

492
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,435
      In my dream, I mean.

493
00:34:31,437 --> 00:34:34,137
  Yeah, I had the same dream.

494
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:35,505
       But it was Byron.

495
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:41,578
        We were roofied.

496
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:46,083
     Those guys roofied us
    last night, didn't they?

497
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:47,384
 I mean, that would explain it.

498
00:34:47,386 --> 00:34:50,454
   This is why we're feeling
     so disoriented today.

499
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:53,723
  It explains us blacking out.

500
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:55,559
That dream was so real, though.

501
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,198
              God.

502
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,499
             I Ugh.

503
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:08,338
      I-- I honestly feel
     really sick right now.

504
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,406
     So where are the guys?

505
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:23,753
           Not here.

506
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,225
         Wait a minute.

507
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:41,204
       My jewelry's gone.

508
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:54,217
              No!

509
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:55,218
            Oh, god!

510
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:04,227
 All my stuff is missing, too!

511
00:36:04,229 --> 00:36:07,864
  They stole the bracelet mom
    gave me before she died.

512
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:09,199
              Hey.

513
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:10,267
            Listen.

514
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:11,368
             Rach.

515
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:14,771
    We're gonna get it back.

516
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:15,772
    We're gonna get it back.

517
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:19,276
           I promise.

518
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:21,278
           Come here.

519
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,279
            It's OK.

520
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:29,786
             Byron!

521
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:31,555
         Are you here?

522
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:32,589
     Give me back my shit!

523
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:33,490
             Colin!

524
00:36:33,492 --> 00:36:34,391
             Vlad!

525
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,199
  Are you fucking kidding me?

526
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:42,899
             Look.

527
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:47,637
         Those bastards
      robbed us, and they

528
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,905
  even took the stupid statue.

529
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,544
      Why would they take
      a worn down statue?

530
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:55,779
       This is bullshit.

531
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:57,847
  This doesn't make any sense.

532
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:03,220
  If-- if they robbed us, why
didn't they take something more

533
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:08,592
valuable, like computers or-- or
cell phones, or iPods, or cash?

534
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:09,926
   This just doesn't add up.

535
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:11,228
         Yeah, I guess.

536
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,429
  Maybe they were in a hurry.

537
00:37:12,431 --> 00:37:14,998
        Alex, the statue
        would be heavy.

538
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,668
     It's not like an in a
      hurry kind of thing.

539
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:21,238
        This isn't good.

540
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:27,277
     No, no, this is-- this
     is not good, you guys.

541
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:31,715
         What the hell
      happened last night?

542
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:33,917
   I mean, first I'm freaked
      that we killed them,

543
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:36,519
       and now I'm pissed
      that they robbed us.

544
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:38,355
      I mean, which is it?

545
00:37:38,357 --> 00:37:39,456
       Jules, calm down.

546
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:42,926
      We'll figure it out.

547
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:44,561
    What are we going to do?

548
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:46,529
     If that statue was an
     antique or something,

549
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:48,365
       it would be worth
        a lot of money.

550
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:49,833
        How much money?

551
00:37:49,835 --> 00:37:50,734
         I don't know.

552
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:51,635
           Thousands?

553
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:52,535
    I mean, I'm not stupid.

554
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:55,939
  I've seen antique roadshows.

555
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:57,941
      It's not like we're
     renting the place, OK?

556
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:00,343
       The program put us
       up here, and they

557
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:01,978
   can't hold us accountable
     for everything inside.

558
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,879
         Yes they can.

559
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:09,019
     I think that we should
   just tell them everything,

560
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:10,620
     before they think that
       we took that thing

561
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,389
  whilst fleeing the country.

562
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:14,591
  Jules, is honesty really the
 best policy in this situation?

563
00:38:14,593 --> 00:38:16,660
  I mean, it's not like we're
  in the right state of mind.

564
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:18,461
Everyone's a little freaked out.

565
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,897
           Yes, I do.

566
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:24,701
    Well, what do you think?

567
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:25,935
          I guess so.

568
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:29,706
        But if we end up
       in a Thai prison,

569
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:32,509
  I'm not digging cockroaches
       out of your ears.

570
00:38:32,511 --> 00:38:33,910
      I'm making the call.

571
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:38,381
             Hello?

572
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:39,883
         This is Julia.

573
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:42,986
      So, listen, somebody
      broke into our house

574
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:44,788
       and they took all
      of our gold jewelry

575
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:47,757
 and even some personal items.

576
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:49,025
             Yeah.

577
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:53,730
    And I hate to say this,
       but, um, they took

578
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:54,931
  that life-size gold statue.

579
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,036
    What do you mean, there
       is no gold statue?

580
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:11,648
       What did she say?

581
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,549
        Are we screwed?

582
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:16,086
             What?

583
00:39:16,088 --> 00:39:18,521
  Was it like 1,000 years old?

584
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,423
  She said there is no statue.

585
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:22,392
             What?

586
00:39:22,394 --> 00:39:23,827
             Yeah.

587
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:25,895
  I told her the whole story.

588
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:28,465
      I even described the
     statue in full detail.

589
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:30,033
        And the program
     housing director said

590
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:32,669
       there is no statue
       at this residence,

591
00:39:32,671 --> 00:39:34,738
    but she'll look into it.

592
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,440
      She'll look into it?

593
00:39:37,442 --> 00:39:39,676
             Yeah.

594
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:42,045
          That was it.

595
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:44,047
     I think she thought I
    was crazy or something.

596
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:49,753
 So I guess we're off the hook.

597
00:39:49,755 --> 00:39:50,787
      This can't be right.

598
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:53,390
      It was right there.

599
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:54,391
             Right?

600
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:55,625
      I remember it, too.

601
00:39:58,429 --> 00:39:59,696
            I think.

602
00:39:59,698 --> 00:40:01,064
           You think?

603
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:03,032
      Well, I don't know.

604
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:08,037
  At this point, I-- I barely
   even remember last night,

605
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:10,006
       let alone the guys
     leaving this morning.

606
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:13,443
     So yes, I am doubting
      my memory a little.

607
00:40:13,445 --> 00:40:16,946
    Look, I know it's been a
 crazy morning, but I'm hungry.

608
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:18,415
       Can we please just
        go get some food

609
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:20,049
    and talk about all this
      serious stuff later?

610
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:23,153
       Yeah, I-- I need a
      break from all this.

611
00:40:23,155 --> 00:40:25,088
    OK, let's just get some
     food and then find out

612
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,756
  more about the statue later.

613
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,958
  Why are we trying to replace
  the statue when the program

614
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,593
   thinks it was never there?

615
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:33,530
  I just want to find out how
   much that thing was worth.

616
00:40:33,532 --> 00:40:34,864
        We're not crazy.

617
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:37,767
 That statue was in the house.

618
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,035
      I don't know, Rach.

619
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:40,670
        Do we even care
      what it's worth now?

620
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:42,939
       I mean, it's gone.

621
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,140
 I already feel guilty enough.

622
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:45,041
              Yes.

623
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:46,075
    Isn't this bugging you?

624
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:47,177
    I mean, where did it go?

625
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:49,813
  The guys stole it, remember?

626
00:40:49,815 --> 00:40:50,947
   Yeah, I thought that, too.

627
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:54,884
 But something just feels off.

628
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:56,219
        Excuse me, sir.

629
00:40:56,221 --> 00:41:00,490
     Um, do you have any of
    these, but made of gold?

630
00:41:00,492 --> 00:41:01,658
           Oh, yeah.

631
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,560
      Many, many statues.

632
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:04,527
         What you like?

633
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:06,129
        Very good price.

634
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:10,033
   Uh, like this, but made of
  real gold, and like a child.

635
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,973
              Yes?

636
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:20,977
     No, like a very young
      looking little girl.

637
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:25,949
       Um, like her size.

638
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:28,084
   But real gold, not paint.

639
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,089
     Real child, real gold?

640
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:35,892
        Do-- do you know
        what that means?

641
00:41:35,894 --> 00:41:38,528
  What kind of statue that is?

642
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,597
              No.

643
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:41,631
     I don't have any more.

644
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:43,132
    Don't sell here anymore.

645
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:45,768
    Uh, do you know what I'm
     talking about, though?

646
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:46,669
       Do you understand?

647
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:47,770
        Understand, yes.

648
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:49,239
       But we don't have.

649
00:41:49,241 --> 00:41:50,540
     We don't do that here.

650
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:51,241
           Good shop.

651
00:41:51,243 --> 00:41:52,842
        Very good shop.

652
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:53,743
           Thank you.

653
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:55,512
            Goodbye.

654
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:56,212
              OK.

655
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:58,681
           Thank you.

656
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,661
              Hi.

657
00:42:11,663 --> 00:42:12,562
        Can I help you?

658
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,599
            Or not.

659
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:24,307
             Rach!

660
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:26,709
            Rachel!

661
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,077
        Don't follow the
       creepy Asian girl!

662
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:28,978
             Rach!

663
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:36,913
    Oh, good, we caught up.

664
00:43:36,915 --> 00:43:38,114
             Yeah.

665
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:39,782
       Now we can all get
       murdered together.

666
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:50,994
      What is this place?

667
00:43:50,996 --> 00:43:52,695
        It's disgusting.

668
00:43:52,697 --> 00:43:55,898
         I don't know.

669
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,201
Man, it looks like some sort of
abandoned village or something.

670
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:25,294
       Oh my god, how is
     she not out of breath?

671
00:44:25,296 --> 00:44:26,195
         I don't know.

672
00:44:26,197 --> 00:44:27,296
         She's a child?

673
00:44:27,298 --> 00:44:28,197
              Oh.

674
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,808
       I think she wants
        us to go inside.

675
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:40,276
           Thoughts?

676
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:42,311
  Well, we're here, aren't we?

677
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:02,131
   Oh my god, let's just get
   the hell out of here, OK?

678
00:45:02,133 --> 00:45:05,234
   This place is a shithole.

679
00:45:05,236 --> 00:45:06,736
       And she's a drunk.

680
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:07,437
              Shh!

681
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:14,177
              Hi.

682
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:15,478
Um, we're looking for a statue.

683
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,046
    It's gold, like a child.

684
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:17,947
            Got one?

685
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:22,852
         Not like that.

686
00:45:22,854 --> 00:45:24,487
   Um, this one's different.

687
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:28,057
     It's, uh-- it's gold,
      like, um, like this.

688
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:28,958
           Real gold.

689
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,934
        I don't think I
      have what you want.

690
00:45:37,936 --> 00:45:40,803
    The little girl from the
 market implied that you would.

691
00:45:40,805 --> 00:45:42,872
        The little girl?

692
00:45:42,874 --> 00:45:43,372
       She's right there.

693
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:49,879
      She was right there.

694
00:45:49,881 --> 00:45:50,813
             Alex.

695
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,219
           All right.

696
00:45:56,221 --> 00:45:57,920
  All right, well, thank you.

697
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:00,389
           Let's go.

698
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:02,892
Yeah, uh,.

699
00:46:02,894 --> 00:46:03,760
         Um, whatever.

700
00:46:03,762 --> 00:46:04,861
           Thank you.

701
00:46:04,863 --> 00:46:05,962
    We're just going to go.

702
00:46:05,964 --> 00:46:06,863
             Stop!

703
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:20,810
   This is the golden statue,
      just like you said.

704
00:46:20,812 --> 00:46:22,078
        Yes, that's it!

705
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,980
          What is it?

706
00:46:23,982 --> 00:46:28,050
    Kumari, the golden girl.

707
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:29,952
       Is that gold real?

708
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:31,187
              Yes.

709
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:33,322
         Very special.

710
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:34,957
           Very rare.

711
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:36,826
           Very old.

712
00:46:36,828 --> 00:46:38,861
       So I guess you're
     not selling it, then.

713
00:46:38,863 --> 00:46:41,164
         Not for sale.

714
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:43,866
     Very, very good luck.

715
00:46:43,868 --> 00:46:45,868
   Is this why you want one?

716
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:50,006
    We had one, but we lost
     it, or it was stolen.

717
00:46:50,008 --> 00:46:52,141
     We're not really sure
      what happened to it.

718
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:54,510
      How did you get it?

719
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:56,479
       Did you buy it on
       the black market?

720
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:57,947
              No!

721
00:46:57,949 --> 00:46:59,315
      It was in our house.

722
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:03,052
        Kumari is meant
       to be worshipped.

723
00:47:03,054 --> 00:47:05,988
  Born from a very dark place.

724
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,124
  It is meant to bring light.

725
00:47:08,126 --> 00:47:10,326
      It's just a statue.

726
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:13,329
      Not just any statue.

727
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:14,931
         It chose you.

728
00:47:14,933 --> 00:47:16,232
         You know what?

729
00:47:16,234 --> 00:47:18,434
      I've-- I've had just
     about enough of this.

730
00:47:18,436 --> 00:47:22,138
       Kumari is a child
      of great sacrifice,

731
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,240
   but it is a child no less.

732
00:47:24,242 --> 00:47:29,879
       It feels jealousy,
       anger, resentment.

733
00:47:29,881 --> 00:47:32,248
      Kumari led you here.

734
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,883
          She escaped.

735
00:47:33,885 --> 00:47:36,385
         Lady say what?

736
00:47:36,387 --> 00:47:40,890
        The little girl,
        she is a vision.

737
00:47:40,892 --> 00:47:42,124
           Not real.

738
00:47:42,126 --> 00:47:43,226
           Bullshit.

739
00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:45,328
     She is following you.

740
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:47,563
      She is your statue.

741
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:49,632
        You let her out.

742
00:47:49,634 --> 00:47:53,002
       What the hell are
       you talking about?

743
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:10,386
 These are for your protection.

744
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:15,958
       You must wear them
        to keep her out.

745
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:21,163
        The kumari, she
       has turned on you.

746
00:48:21,165 --> 00:48:24,934
        She is ready to
       take her revenge.

747
00:48:24,936 --> 00:48:28,271
OK, I've had enough freaky
    for the day.

748
00:48:28,273 --> 00:48:29,472
    Yeah, right behind you.

749
00:48:29,474 --> 00:48:33,976
You know you sound nuts, right?

750
00:48:33,978 --> 00:48:38,547
      If you knew what it
     took to make a kumari,

751
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:40,182
         you would see
      things differently!

752
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,064
          So what now?

753
00:48:55,066 --> 00:48:55,698
       Guess we go home.

754
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,099
             Great.

755
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:59,335
       That sounds like a
       blast and a half.

756
00:48:59,337 --> 00:49:00,937
   Alex, what are you doing?

757
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:04,407
      of junk given to you
     by a drunken old woman

758
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:05,508
       to keep you safe?

759
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:06,575
            Please.

760
00:49:06,577 --> 00:49:07,944
       It's your funeral.

761
00:49:12,951 --> 00:49:15,952
    I'm gonna put you where
     everyone can see you.

762
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:17,520
           All right.

763
00:49:17,522 --> 00:49:21,123
  So, Julia tells me you guys
 want to know a little bit more

764
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,459
    about this Thai legend.

765
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:25,061
          The kumari.

766
00:49:25,063 --> 00:49:27,263
       We're getting more
       into the culture.

767
00:49:27,265 --> 00:49:29,065
            Oh yeah?

768
00:49:29,067 --> 00:49:32,001
 Because I thought it was some
 creepy old lady that told you

769
00:49:32,003 --> 00:49:34,136
a ghost child was haunting you.

770
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:35,538
    Well, it was that, too.

771
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,539
        I filled him in.

772
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:37,440
           Obviously.

773
00:49:37,442 --> 00:49:39,241
           All right.

774
00:49:39,243 --> 00:49:41,978
Well, it turns out this is some
pretty serious shit, all right?

775
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:46,182
   When a kid died violently,
   in some horrific accident

776
00:49:46,184 --> 00:49:49,185
 or whatever-- what they would
 do, they would take the body,

777
00:49:49,187 --> 00:49:51,454
       cover it in blood,
      dry burn the bones,

778
00:49:51,456 --> 00:49:53,589
         and encase the
      damn thing in gold.

779
00:49:53,591 --> 00:49:57,126
        All part of this
      ritual, the kumari.

780
00:49:57,128 --> 00:49:59,195
  Supposed to bring good luck.

781
00:49:59,197 --> 00:50:00,296
         That's gross.

782
00:50:00,298 --> 00:50:02,431
       And it gets worse.

783
00:50:02,433 --> 00:50:05,401
    A lot of necromancers--
   they wanted more children.

784
00:50:05,403 --> 00:50:07,370
    So what they would do--
    they would go out there

785
00:50:07,372 --> 00:50:09,005
 and actually start murdering.

786
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:11,607
    And eventually, the Thai
government banned the practice,

787
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:14,110
 but they still do it, and they
 sell them on the black market

788
00:50:14,112 --> 00:50:15,478
   for thousands of dollars.

789
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,013
           Oh my god.

790
00:50:17,015 --> 00:50:19,115
    That's why that old lady
     asked where we got it.

791
00:50:19,117 --> 00:50:22,184
    It was actually supposed
       to be worshipped.

792
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:25,321
 And from what I hear, you guys
 kind of failed on the worship

793
00:50:25,323 --> 00:50:27,289
   part and let it get away.

794
00:50:27,291 --> 00:50:28,524
   Oh my god, it was stolen.

795
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,159
    How was that our fault?

796
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:32,395
    Well, the old witch said
     that we let it escape,

797
00:50:32,397 --> 00:50:33,629
so maybe that's what she meant.

798
00:50:33,631 --> 00:50:35,398
        I don't think it
      physically escaped.

799
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,368
   I think it had to do more
 with the spirit of the child.

800
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,570
      Like it was trapped?

801
00:50:41,572 --> 00:50:42,505
             Yeah.

802
00:50:42,507 --> 00:50:45,041
   And now it wants revenge.

803
00:50:45,043 --> 00:50:48,444
  Best advice I can give you?

804
00:50:48,446 --> 00:50:50,079
             Shane?

805
00:50:50,081 --> 00:50:52,648
             Shane?

806
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:55,584
  Shit, my computer just died.

807
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:57,286
  Did that really just happen?

808
00:50:57,288 --> 00:50:58,187
             Yeah.

809
00:50:58,189 --> 00:50:59,422
       What are the odds?

810
00:50:59,424 --> 00:51:01,457
      He's like, you guys
       should, then zap.

811
00:51:01,459 --> 00:51:02,558
        Thank you, Alex.

812
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:06,328
That was a super helpful recap.

813
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:09,331
     OK, new plan, we move.

814
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:11,267
    As in leave this house?

815
00:51:11,269 --> 00:51:13,769
    Yes, as in we go to the
    housing office tomorrow

816
00:51:13,771 --> 00:51:17,073
  I mean, do you think they're
   going to be OK with that,

817
00:51:17,075 --> 00:51:18,707
    and not just think we're
    three spoiled Americans

818
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:21,110
  part of our volunteer work?

819
00:51:21,112 --> 00:51:23,212
      I really don't care
        what they think.

820
00:51:23,214 --> 00:51:29,218
   Thai statue or no statue,
    this-- this house-- it's

821
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:30,820
giving me a really bad feeling.

822
00:51:30,822 --> 00:51:33,422
   The Brits and the old man,
     and-- and the statue--

823
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:35,257
 Well, the Brits were my fault.

824
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:36,725
          That's true.

825
00:51:36,727 --> 00:51:37,726
          And Alex's.

826
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:39,228
          -Not really.
        -You know what?

827
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:41,097
       It doesn't matter
       whose fault it is.

828
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:43,699
   Everything about this just
   screams get the hell out!

829
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:36,919
          You serious?

830
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:47,563
              OK.

831
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:34,877
      It's not real, it's
    not real, it's not real.

832
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,096
        Bloody clothes.

833
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:35,150
           Oh my God!

834
00:57:35,152 --> 00:57:36,051
            Someone!

835
00:57:36,053 --> 00:57:37,753
       Somebody help me!

836
00:57:37,755 --> 00:57:40,055
  Get me the hell out of here!

837
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:19,895
     Oh my God, oh my God!

838
00:58:19,897 --> 00:58:21,063
  There's something in there!

839
00:58:21,065 --> 00:58:22,064
           I felt it!

840
00:58:22,066 --> 00:58:24,032
       There's something
        in the bathroom.

841
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:25,834
 The girl was in the bathroom.

842
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:27,569
   I saw her, and suddenly--

843
00:58:27,571 --> 00:58:30,138
   I was in there, and there
 was this thing in the closet,

844
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:31,773
and it started crawling in the--

845
00:58:31,775 --> 00:58:34,076
    Rachel, I saw her in the
 water, and then in the mirror.

846
00:58:34,078 --> 00:58:35,277
        It was the girl.

847
00:58:35,279 --> 00:58:36,178
              Hey!

848
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,079
              Hey!

849
00:58:37,081 --> 00:58:38,814
       Everybody shut up.

850
00:58:38,816 --> 00:58:40,282
      Julia, get dressed.

851
00:58:40,284 --> 00:58:41,783
              Go.

852
00:58:41,785 --> 00:58:44,586
       What is going on?

853
00:58:44,588 --> 00:58:45,287
         I don't know.

854
00:58:45,289 --> 00:58:46,588
      We can't stay here.

855
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:49,191
     I'm seriously freaked
         out right now.

856
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:50,993
       Me too, but where
        are we gonna go?

857
00:58:50,995 --> 00:58:52,628
 It's the middle of the night.

858
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:54,296
      It's not like we're
      in freaking Bangkok!

859
00:58:54,298 --> 00:58:56,131
We're in the sticks of Thailand!

860
00:58:56,133 --> 00:58:57,799
    Well then, we'll call a
  cab, and we'll have it take

861
00:58:57,801 --> 00:58:58,767
  us somewhere more populated.

862
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:00,135
     Who has a cell phone?

863
00:59:00,137 --> 00:59:03,005
     I haven't had service
       since I got here.

864
00:59:03,007 --> 00:59:04,907
             Shit.

865
00:59:04,909 --> 00:59:06,275
    We're sleeping upstairs.

866
00:59:06,277 --> 00:59:07,175
           All right?

867
00:59:07,177 --> 00:59:09,578
       Safety in numbers.

868
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:12,314
    And then I think we need
    to go see that old lady.

869
00:59:12,316 --> 00:59:13,549
      -No, no, no, no, no.
             -Yes.

870
00:59:13,551 --> 00:59:14,316
    No, no, no, no, no, no.

871
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:14,917
              Yes.

872
00:59:14,919 --> 00:59:16,251
              No!

873
00:59:16,253 --> 00:59:17,686
     You said we were just
    going to switch houses.

874
00:59:17,688 --> 00:59:21,723
       That seems like a
     much, much safer plan.

875
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:24,960
 I don't think it's the house.

876
00:59:24,962 --> 00:59:26,161
     I think it's the girl.

877
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:43,932
              Mmm.

878
01:01:43,934 --> 01:01:44,933
            Wake up.

879
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:45,434
             Mm-mm.

880
01:01:45,436 --> 01:01:46,401
            Wake up.

881
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:55,310
           God, Rach.

882
01:01:55,312 --> 01:01:57,145
        You guys ready?

883
01:01:57,147 --> 01:01:58,146
            I guess.

884
01:01:58,148 --> 01:01:59,047
              OK.

885
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:08,056
          Is that mud?

886
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:09,424
         On the floor?

887
01:02:09,426 --> 01:02:11,727
        We probably just
    tracked it in yesterday.

888
01:02:11,729 --> 01:02:13,028
       Come on, let's go.

889
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:17,299
            Come on.

890
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:23,772
         Where is she?

891
01:02:23,774 --> 01:02:25,874
  Oh, this is not a good sign.

892
01:02:25,876 --> 01:02:27,409
             Great.

893
01:02:27,411 --> 01:02:29,377
 WE came all the way down here,
   and she's not even around.

894
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:31,947
 Something doesn't feel right.

895
01:02:31,949 --> 01:02:35,450
        No, not at all.

896
01:02:35,452 --> 01:02:36,451
            Come on.

897
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,251
    What are you doing here?

898
01:03:14,223 --> 01:03:15,190
           Excuse me.

899
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:23,298
           So sorry.

900
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,934
      Uh, he used to know
        the family that

901
01:03:25,936 --> 01:03:28,236
  lived here, many years ago.

902
01:03:28,238 --> 01:03:30,972
Now he gets confused and forgets
that they're no longer with us.

903
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:32,240
           Is he OK?

904
01:03:32,242 --> 01:03:33,141
        Yeah, he's fine.

905
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:34,176
    I'll just take him home.

906
01:03:34,178 --> 01:03:34,943
             Wait.

907
01:03:34,945 --> 01:03:35,844
         What is that?

908
01:03:35,846 --> 01:03:36,945
      What is he holding?

909
01:03:47,423 --> 01:03:48,990
   He's not making any sense.

910
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:50,425
        I'm sorry again.

911
01:03:50,427 --> 01:03:53,528
 No, why was he pointing at us?

912
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:56,364
        He said, you all
       took it from her.

913
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,973
 He knows something about this.

914
01:04:04,975 --> 01:04:05,874
         I can feel it.

915
01:04:05,876 --> 01:04:07,175
           Oh my god.

916
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:10,011
      Did you see the way
     he was pointing at us?

917
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:11,613
        It's like we did
        something wrong.

918
01:04:11,615 --> 01:04:12,514
       It's that amulet.

919
01:04:12,516 --> 01:04:13,882
    The one he was holding.

920
01:04:13,884 --> 01:04:16,318
  Yeah, from the spirit house.

921
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,519
           Excuse me?

922
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:18,987
         When we first
     arrived, I snatched it

923
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:20,021
     from the spirit house.

924
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:21,122
              Oh.

925
01:04:21,124 --> 01:04:22,224
   I thought it looked cool.

926
01:04:22,226 --> 01:04:24,059
        I don't know how
       he got it, though.

927
01:04:24,061 --> 01:04:27,062
   That spirit house that is
   now full of dead flowers?

928
01:04:27,064 --> 01:04:28,396
        Yeah, that one.

929
01:04:28,398 --> 01:04:30,365
         All right, I'm
       going over there.

930
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:31,600
          He can help.

931
01:04:31,602 --> 01:04:34,636
     No, Rachel, he doesn't
      even speak English!

932
01:04:34,638 --> 01:04:35,537
         You heard him.

933
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:36,905
         He is insane.

934
01:04:36,907 --> 01:04:40,375
      Jules, we're having
   horrifying murder dreams,

935
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:43,979
  seeing little girl ghosts--
   I'm going over there, OK?

936
01:04:43,981 --> 01:04:44,613
      I want this to stop.

937
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:50,418
             Fine.

938
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:52,621
      Creepy house across
         the way it is.

939
01:05:09,139 --> 01:05:11,006
         Oh, it's you.

940
01:05:11,008 --> 01:05:12,407
      How can I help you?

941
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:13,541
I need to talk to that old man.

942
01:05:13,543 --> 01:05:15,176
    Yeah, it's an emergency.

943
01:05:15,178 --> 01:05:16,378
         I'm sorry, but
       he's resting now.

944
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:17,345
            Please?

945
01:05:17,347 --> 01:05:19,948
       You can translate!

946
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:22,017
         Excuse me, but
       this is very rude.

947
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:23,985
     Look, I know he barged
        into your house.

948
01:05:23,987 --> 01:05:25,120
           I'm sorry.

949
01:05:25,122 --> 01:05:26,354
       But he's not well.

950
01:05:26,356 --> 01:05:27,589
            Please.

951
01:05:27,591 --> 01:05:29,925
       I'm really sorry,
      but this is urgent.

952
01:05:29,927 --> 01:05:33,261
We need you to ask him about the
 previous owners of that house

953
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:34,529
to see if there's a connection.

954
01:05:34,531 --> 01:05:35,664
      Connection to what?

955
01:05:35,666 --> 01:05:38,133
  To the amulet that he took.

956
01:05:38,135 --> 01:05:39,701
              OK?

957
01:05:39,703 --> 01:05:42,270
  And then there's this little
 girl statue that went missing,

958
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:43,705
       and I just need to
        talk to him, OK?

959
01:05:43,707 --> 01:05:46,474
     I am not going to ask
    him anything about that.

960
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:58,720
     He said he'd help you.

961
01:05:58,722 --> 01:05:59,688
           Thank you.

962
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:24,145
 The old house belonged to his
  brother Tiwa many years ago.

963
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:26,748
      Tiwa had a beautiful
       wife named Samorn

964
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:28,583
  and a daughter named Vanida.

965
01:06:31,621 --> 01:06:33,054
MALE SPEAKER
Tiwa was

966
01:06:33,056 --> 01:06:34,556
a good brother, and a good man.

967
01:06:48,138 --> 01:06:50,205
      Samorn was pregnant,
         and they knew

968
01:06:50,207 --> 01:06:52,307
   they were going to have a
    son, which was something

969
01:06:52,309 --> 01:06:54,209
  they had always wished for.

970
01:06:54,211 --> 01:06:57,278
    But Samorn was very ill.

971
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,714
    She had gone to see many
   doctors, but none of them

972
01:06:59,716 --> 01:07:02,217
        could help her.

973
01:07:10,794 --> 01:07:12,727
Tiwa was very desperate.

974
01:07:12,729 --> 01:07:15,597
    He went to see a fortune
     teller in the village.

975
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:18,166
Some people called her a witch.

976
01:07:18,168 --> 01:07:21,236
       She was known for
  communicating with the dead.

977
01:07:21,238 --> 01:07:23,438
       Her name was Isra.

978
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,274
        Tiwa asked her.

979
01:07:26,276 --> 01:07:30,445
  Tiwa begged her to save the
life of his wife and unborn son.

980
01:07:30,447 --> 01:07:32,814
 He said he would do anything.

981
01:07:32,816 --> 01:07:37,152
      She asked him if he
   would really do anything.

982
01:07:37,154 --> 01:07:42,190
Isra told him that he would have
 to trade one life for another.

983
01:07:42,192 --> 01:07:45,760
  But they would have to come
    from the same bloodline.

984
01:07:45,762 --> 01:07:49,164
 Tiwa realized that this meant
   that he would have to give

985
01:07:49,166 --> 01:07:51,399
        up not only his
       own life, but that

986
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:53,735
 of his young daughter, Vanida.

987
01:07:57,741 --> 01:08:02,477
He did not want to do this, but
he felt he had no other choice.

988
01:08:02,479 --> 01:08:04,345
      Isra explained that
        there was a way

989
01:08:04,347 --> 01:08:07,749
 to keep Vanida's spirit alive.

990
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:11,753
 She said if she was covered in
 the blood of a tortured human,

991
01:08:11,755 --> 01:08:15,723
       Tiwa's blood, and
     then encased in gold,

992
01:08:15,725 --> 01:08:17,725
        that her spirit
     would live on forever

993
01:08:17,727 --> 01:08:21,663
        and could bring
      luck to her family.

994
01:08:21,665 --> 01:08:24,833
    Tiwa agreed to do this,
  but his wife was not happy.

995
01:08:27,637 --> 01:08:29,704
But he could not let his wife

996
01:08:29,706 --> 01:08:32,173
          and son die.

997
01:08:32,175 --> 01:08:34,542
       She asked Tiwa not
       to do it, but Tiwa

998
01:08:34,544 --> 01:08:38,146
was determined to save his wife
 and unborn son, no matter what

999
01:08:38,148 --> 01:08:40,248
           the cost.

1000
01:08:43,687 --> 01:08:46,287
He asked me for a favor.

1001
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:48,756
      He asked me to help
       with this ritual,

1002
01:08:48,758 --> 01:08:52,393
     to bring my tools and
       gold from my shop.

1003
01:08:52,395 --> 01:08:53,294
         I told him no.

1004
01:08:55,332 --> 01:08:57,532
But he begged me.

1005
01:08:57,534 --> 01:08:58,433
        What could I do?

1006
01:09:06,343 --> 01:09:08,376
The
 next day, I went to his house

1007
01:09:08,378 --> 01:09:11,479
       with my supplies.

1008
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:14,315
 We went down to the basement.

1009
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:15,216
         Down to hell.

1010
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:56,491
She was so small.

1011
01:09:56,493 --> 01:09:57,792
       Too easy to kill.

1012
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:09,704
   When it was done, we went
    upstairs to get Samorn.

1013
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,909
       When I entered the
        room, I saw her.

1014
01:10:14,911 --> 01:10:17,212
 It is an image I cannot shake.

1015
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:22,884
     There she was, hanging
       from the rafters,

1016
01:10:22,886 --> 01:10:27,555
the beautiful, pregnant Samorn.

1017
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:30,325
     She had hung herself.

1018
01:10:32,996 --> 01:10:35,597
Everything had gone wrong.

1019
01:10:35,599 --> 01:10:36,564
  The ritual was for nothing.

1020
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:44,339
Isra warned me that the child's
 spirit would now be restless.

1021
01:10:44,341 --> 01:10:45,273
       Her death in vain.

1022
01:10:50,779 --> 01:11:03,925
  So we created the amulet and
 placed it in the spirit house

1023
01:11:03,927 --> 01:11:08,596
    so that her spirit would
      not be free to enter

1024
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:11,532
     the world, until now.

1025
01:11:11,534 --> 01:11:13,568
    The statue in the house.

1026
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:14,969
 It's Vanida, the little girl?

1027
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:16,437
        And you made it
      and you killed her?

1028
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:30,652
              Yes.

1029
01:11:30,654 --> 01:11:32,353
      How can we stop her?

1030
01:11:46,835 --> 01:11:49,637
      She is what she is.

1031
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:51,706
    She's what we made her.

1032
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:54,909
   Kumari cannot be stopped.

1033
01:11:54,911 --> 01:11:55,977
         There must be
      something we can do.

1034
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:08,323
   He wants you to have this.

1035
01:12:08,325 --> 01:12:10,458
           Thank you.

1036
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:11,726
        Will this help?

1037
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:17,965
         We should go.

1038
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:37,485
      I cannot believe he
   murdered that little girl.

1039
01:12:37,487 --> 01:12:38,619
  We need to leave right now.

1040
01:12:38,621 --> 01:12:40,722
   His brother asked him to.

1041
01:12:40,724 --> 01:12:42,590
    And we can't just leave.

1042
01:12:42,592 --> 01:12:43,524
    You heard what he said.

1043
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:44,425
     The girl is after us.

1044
01:12:44,427 --> 01:12:47,628
     He could have said no.

1045
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:49,630
       We wouldn't be in
        this nightmare.

1046
01:12:49,632 --> 01:12:51,099
      It's not that easy!

1047
01:12:51,101 --> 01:12:53,935
These rituals are real to them.

1048
01:12:53,937 --> 01:12:56,070
      He probably thought
     he was really helping.

1049
01:12:56,072 --> 01:12:57,572
   Are you serious right now?

1050
01:12:57,574 --> 01:12:59,974
       He killed Vanida!

1051
01:12:59,976 --> 01:13:05,980
He sliced her open, drained her
blood, and covered her in gold!

1052
01:13:05,982 --> 01:13:08,116
          Like a doll!

1053
01:13:08,118 --> 01:13:10,084
         And for what?

1054
01:13:10,086 --> 01:13:13,087
      For an unborn child?

1055
01:13:13,089 --> 01:13:14,055
         Al, calm down!

1056
01:13:14,057 --> 01:13:16,057
  Don't tell me to calm down!

1057
01:13:25,467 --> 01:13:26,968
         Give me that!

1058
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:44,519
             There.

1059
01:13:44,521 --> 01:13:45,119
           It's done.

1060
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:51,559
   What's with the salt, Al?

1061
01:13:51,561 --> 01:13:53,161
         Saw it on TV.

1062
01:16:49,171 --> 01:16:50,071
              Shh.

1063
01:17:03,152 --> 01:17:04,652
 It's coming from Sang's house.

1064
01:17:04,654 --> 01:17:05,886
   We need to get over there.

1065
01:17:05,888 --> 01:17:07,321
              No.

1066
01:17:07,323 --> 01:17:08,823
  D-don't you think we should
     just call the police?

1067
01:17:08,825 --> 01:17:10,024
      We have no service!

1068
01:17:10,026 --> 01:17:11,726
    What if he's in trouble?

1069
01:17:11,728 --> 01:17:12,994
        -What do we do?
       -There's no time.

1070
01:17:12,996 --> 01:17:13,894
           Let's go!

1071
01:17:29,779 --> 01:17:31,045
        You killed him!

1072
01:17:33,116 --> 01:17:34,415
        You killed him!

1073
01:17:34,417 --> 01:17:36,717
      Just like you killed
    your brother and Vanida!

1074
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:37,418
              Why?

1075
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:38,419
      Why did you do this?

1076
01:17:38,421 --> 01:17:39,420
       Why did you do it?

1077
01:17:39,422 --> 01:17:40,321
              No!

1078
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:51,832
    Oh God, oh God, oh God.

1079
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:52,733
          This is bad.

1080
01:17:52,735 --> 01:17:53,434
          This is bad.

1081
01:17:53,436 --> 01:17:54,368
     This is so bad, Julie.

1082
01:17:54,370 --> 01:17:55,269
            Shut up.

1083
01:17:55,271 --> 01:17:56,437
   So so so, this is so bad.

1084
01:17:56,439 --> 01:17:57,805
        Julia, shut up.

1085
01:17:57,807 --> 01:17:58,906
            Shut up?

1086
01:17:58,908 --> 01:17:59,940
   I just murdered somebody!

1087
01:17:59,942 --> 01:18:01,409
   Don't tell me to shut up!

1088
01:18:01,411 --> 01:18:02,777
     We murdered somebody.

1089
01:18:02,779 --> 01:18:04,011
        We're all here.

1090
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:05,680
    It's all our fault, OK?

1091
01:18:05,682 --> 01:18:07,181
  We need to leave right now.

1092
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:09,216
       What are we gonna
       do with the body?

1093
01:18:09,218 --> 01:18:11,085
       Rachel, there are
        two bodies here!

1094
01:18:11,087 --> 01:18:12,219
          Leave them!

1095
01:18:12,221 --> 01:18:13,120
         Let's just go.

1096
01:18:13,122 --> 01:18:14,021
         Guys, come on.

1097
01:18:26,902 --> 01:18:27,935
   I don't blame you, Julia.

1098
01:18:27,937 --> 01:18:30,871
       It had to be done.

1099
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:32,440
 No it did not have to be done.

1100
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:36,077
       I killed someone.

1101
01:18:39,748 --> 01:18:41,716
       He was a murderer.

1102
01:18:41,718 --> 01:18:43,784
     I cannot believe what
     I'm hearing right now!

1103
01:18:43,786 --> 01:18:44,785
    What is wrong with you?

1104
01:18:44,787 --> 01:18:48,122
      Let's not talk about
       it right now, OK?

1105
01:18:48,124 --> 01:18:50,357
 We need to leave this country.

1106
01:18:50,359 --> 01:18:52,126
     As in get on a plane.

1107
01:18:52,128 --> 01:18:53,294
       Everyone, go pack.

1108
01:18:53,296 --> 01:18:54,195
          I'm-- I'm--

1109
01:18:54,197 --> 01:18:55,896
      Julia, just go pack!

1110
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:56,897
           All right!

1111
01:19:34,036 --> 01:19:35,336
   Where's that coming from?

1112
01:19:35,338 --> 01:19:36,337
         I don't know!

1113
01:19:44,045 --> 01:19:46,514
     I don't remember there
      being a door there.

1114
01:19:50,051 --> 01:19:52,119
         Come on, Rach,
      it's just a closet.

1115
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:53,020
           Let's go.

1116
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:08,235
       It's the basement.

1117
01:20:08,237 --> 01:20:10,204
   Alex, are you down there?

1118
01:20:10,206 --> 01:20:11,906
      Guys, get down here.

1119
01:20:11,908 --> 01:20:12,506
     You've gotta see this!

1120
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,882
    God, what is that smell?

1121
01:20:21,884 --> 01:20:24,185
              Ugh.

1122
01:20:35,597 --> 01:20:36,497
              God.

1123
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:56,584
 This look familiar to anyone?

1124
01:20:56,586 --> 01:20:57,551
            Oh, God!

1125
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:02,556
         I dreamt this.

1126
01:21:07,996 --> 01:21:09,430
           So did I.

1127
01:21:09,432 --> 01:21:11,098
         I know it was
    redundant, but me three.

1128
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:15,135
    Alex, this isn't funny.

1129
01:21:15,137 --> 01:21:17,004
      No one said it was.

1130
01:21:33,955 --> 01:21:36,357
     It was us, wasn't it?

1131
01:21:36,359 --> 01:21:38,492
       That's impossible.

1132
01:21:46,034 --> 01:21:47,201
      The bloody clothes.

1133
01:21:47,203 --> 01:21:49,236
      What bloody clothes?

1134
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:50,170
          In my room.

1135
01:21:50,172 --> 01:21:51,272
         I found them.

1136
01:21:51,274 --> 01:21:53,274
   I didn't know what to do.

1137
01:22:28,077 --> 01:22:28,676
    And now it makes sense.

1138
01:22:32,547 --> 01:22:33,981
           It was us.

1139
01:22:40,555 --> 01:22:41,622
       It was always us.

1140
01:22:45,427 --> 01:22:46,393
         You're wrong.

1141
01:22:46,395 --> 01:22:48,128
     It started out as us.

1142
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:52,566
 Then you two put your amulets
  on, and then it was just me.

1143
01:22:52,568 --> 01:22:53,434
         Finally free.

1144
01:23:08,683 --> 01:23:12,319
   Alex, what are you doing?

1145
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:15,155
   Showing you what I can do.

1146
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:18,325
          What are you
      talking about, Alex?

1147
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:20,027
      Your witch is dead.

1148
01:23:20,029 --> 01:23:23,063
I smashed her fucking face
   in the jungle.

1149
01:23:23,065 --> 01:23:25,065
         And the nurse?

1150
01:23:25,067 --> 01:23:26,233
         Did him, too.

1151
01:23:26,235 --> 01:23:27,768
      Oh, and the old man?

1152
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:31,171
Well, you guys were there
      for that.

1153
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:33,440
      That-- that was fun.

1154
01:23:33,442 --> 01:23:35,509
        Good job, Julia.

1155
01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:39,346
         I didn't think
       you had it in you.

1156
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:41,548
    Alex, we're your family.

1157
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:43,450
     You're not my family.

1158
01:24:07,308 --> 01:24:08,242
   Alex, what are you doing?

1159
01:24:08,244 --> 01:24:09,143
             Stop!

1160
01:24:16,584 --> 01:24:18,552
              No.

1161
01:24:18,554 --> 01:24:19,553
             Alex.

1162
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:20,621
             Alex!

1163
01:24:20,623 --> 01:24:21,522
             Stop!

1164
01:24:21,524 --> 01:24:24,525
      What are you doing?

1165
01:24:24,527 --> 01:24:27,494
         Alex, it's OK!

1166
01:24:27,496 --> 01:24:29,196
      It's me, it's Julia!

1167
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:30,264
         Alex, please!

1168
01:24:30,266 --> 01:24:33,734
         Stop it, Alex!

1169
01:24:33,736 --> 01:24:34,735
          It's Julia.

1170
01:24:34,737 --> 01:24:36,437
             Stop.

1171
01:24:36,439 --> 01:24:38,205
   Alex, what are you doing?

1172
01:24:38,207 --> 01:24:40,207
         Please, stop!

1173
01:24:40,209 --> 01:24:41,208
          Alex, stop!

1174
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:42,709
          Alex, stop!

1175
01:24:42,711 --> 01:24:43,777
             Stop!

1176
01:24:43,779 --> 01:24:44,678
              No!

1177
01:24:47,782 --> 01:24:48,682
              No!

1178
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:54,655
              No!

1179
01:25:01,629 --> 01:25:03,697
          No, stop it!

1180
01:25:03,699 --> 01:25:04,598
              No!

1181
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:07,301
           Oh my god!

1182
01:25:07,303 --> 01:25:09,303
         Listen to me!

1183
01:25:09,305 --> 01:25:10,604
          I love you!

1184
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:12,873
  I love you, I'm your sister!

1185
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:18,345
          Please stop!

1186
01:25:18,347 --> 01:25:19,546
              God!

1187
01:25:19,548 --> 01:25:20,447
              No!

1188
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:26,854
            Please!

1189
01:25:26,856 --> 01:25:28,489
              No!

1190
01:25:28,491 --> 01:25:29,756
          No, stop it!

1191
01:25:36,698 --> 01:25:38,799
 Alex, why are you doing this?

1192
01:25:44,372 --> 01:25:45,806
         Alex, please!

1193
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:47,741
         Listen to me!

1194
01:25:47,743 --> 01:25:49,910
   Listen to me, I love you!

1195
01:25:49,912 --> 01:25:51,879
         Don't hurt me!

1196
01:25:51,881 --> 01:25:53,814
   Please, you're my sister!

1197
01:25:56,251 --> 01:25:56,750
         Vanida, stop.

1198
01:26:03,391 --> 01:26:04,625
      I know you're here.

1199
01:26:07,462 --> 01:26:09,663
   You don't have to do this.

1200
01:26:09,665 --> 01:26:14,434
I know they did horrible things
   to you, but it wasn't us.

1201
01:26:14,436 --> 01:26:15,602
    Give me back my sister!

1202
01:26:15,604 --> 01:26:18,472
 They took everything from me!

1203
01:26:18,474 --> 01:26:24,711
    They took my life, they
  took my blood, and for what?

1204
01:26:24,713 --> 01:26:26,880
    To give themselves luck?

1205
01:26:26,882 --> 01:26:28,749
    For someone else's life?

1206
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:38,458
    You three came in here,
   entitled, smug, arrogant.

1207
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:39,960
      You have everything
         I ever wanted.

1208
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:47,768
      But you set me free.

1209
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:49,269
         It wasn't us.

1210
01:28:52,593 --> 01:28:53,493
           Hey, babe.

1211
01:28:53,495 --> 01:28:55,495
        What's going on?

1212
01:28:55,497 --> 01:28:57,431
I was just about to go to sleep.

1213
01:28:57,433 --> 01:28:58,332
             Alex?

1214
01:28:58,334 --> 01:28:58,899
           What's up?

1215
01:29:01,703 --> 01:29:02,602
             Alex?

1216
01:29:02,604 --> 01:29:03,937
         You all right?

1217
01:29:03,939 --> 01:29:06,039
        What's going on?

1218
01:29:06,041 --> 01:29:08,575
  Something happened to Julia.

1219
01:29:08,577 --> 01:29:09,943
      You need to fly out
        here right away.
