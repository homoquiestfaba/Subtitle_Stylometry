186
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,570
We'll need your account details

187
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,404
and your shipping address.

188
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,721
Of course.

189
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,241
(sighs)
I love Christmas.

190
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,165
Wrapping presents and all that.

191
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,367
And then,

192
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,171
somehow you wind up overcooking

193
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,243
the turkey anyway.

194
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,203
Done.

195
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,048
Where'd you learn so much
about train sets?

196
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,281
Oh, I read.

197
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,602
Too much, probably.

198
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,125
That's refreshing.

199
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,931
Thank you.

200
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,401
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

201
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,566
(whispering):
I like the hat.

202
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,245
STORE ANNOUNCER:
There's a gift for everybody

203
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,402

00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,643
where you'll find the entire
Parker pen line on sale,

205
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,361
including Parker's new
smooth lining 51.

206
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,921
With only one moving part,

207
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,243
making writing
as easy as conversation.

208
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,402
See what the sensation
of the season is

209
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,561
in our toys department

210
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,171
on the fourth floor.

211
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,446
You won't be able to resist
the best-selling...

212
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,721
(alarm ringing)

213
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,923
(ringing stops)

214
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,326
WOMAN:
You look absolutely divine!

215
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,720
Turn around.

216
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,211
- Please.
- Come on.

217
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,010
- Perfect, wonderful shoulders.
- (thumps)

218
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,326
MAN:
Move over.

219
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,766
Nobody else can see the screen.

220
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,410
Nobody else is watching.

221
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,562
(chuckles)
I'm watching.

222
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,200
MAN 2:
I've seen it six times.

223
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,443
Hmm?

224
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,489
Right now, I'm charting
the correlation

225
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,927
between what the characters say
and how they really feel.

226
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,163
My kid brother, the movie jerk.

227
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,641
(lively chatter)

228
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,883
I'm strictly a beer man.

229
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,804
Everything else makes me
want to vomit.

230
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,086
(chuckles)

231
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,520
Well, wine makes me
feel naughty,

232
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,891
but in a good way.

233
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,407
I drink to forget I got to
get up for work in the morning.

234
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,686
Oh, see,
that's your problem, Semco.

235
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,887
You really ought to drink

236
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,440
because you remember
you have a job.

237
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,760
Employment's a curse.

238
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,081
You have a job, Phil.

239
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,287
You call that a job?

240
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,441
I call that an illusion.

241
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,647
You get paid.

242
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,484
Is money an illusion?

243
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,449
My kid brother,
the jerk philosopher.

244
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,443
And where do you work?

245
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,364
- Mmm.
- Didn't you know?

246
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,921
Dannie works
at the New York Times.

247
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,127
No kidding.

248
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,044
It's a job.

249
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,884
What I really want
to do is write.

250
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,963
That's why I watch movies.

251
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,565
Everybody's a writer.

252
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,882
Uh, say, Therese,

253
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,644
before I get too drunk
to remember...

254
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,404
(gasps)
You did it?

255
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,561
It's fixed?

256
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,165
He said it was a cinch,
no sweat.

257
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,407
Oh, thank you, Phil.

258
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,449
I was missing it.

259
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,125
So you take pictures?

260
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,560
Well...

261
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,210
She's more excited
about some chintzy camera

262
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,283
than she is about sailing
with me to Europe.

263
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,761
- Women!
- You said it, pal.

264
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,524
- I don't believe it!
- Oh, look who's coming.

265
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,682
Does the House
Un-American Activities know

266
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,604
- you two are back on the streets?
- It's been ages.

267
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,569
- Call me, would you?
- I will, I promise.

268
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,767
You still owe me

269
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,680
- for that poker game!
- Richard, watch out!

270
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,569
- Yeah, sure, I do.
- Say,

271
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,047
you should come by the Times

272
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,440
for dinner sometime.

273
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,608
I work nights, so...

274
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,489
I got a pal
who's a junior photo editor.

275
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,727
He loves to pontificate.

276
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,564
- I'll introduce you.
- Really?

277
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,848
- Yeah, I'd like that.
- (laughter)

278
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,525
Yeah?

279
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,920
- Okay.
- Okay.

280
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,003

Did she?

00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,802
Are you gonna color

I know she'd love

Well, give her my best.

Well, I told the customer

320
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,368
it would arrive
by Christmas Eve.

321
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,521
According to what
we've been told,

322
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,761
three days should be
plenty of time.

323
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,331
It should've been delivered
this afternoon.

324
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,244
Oh.

325
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,526
Right.

So it arrived,
she signed for it?

I'm sorry.
Would you excuse me?

- I'll just be one moment.
- Of course.

338
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,601
Yes, um, I was trying

I did. Yes.

348
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,611
And the gloves.

349
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,886
Thank you so much.

350
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,371
You're a star for sending them.

(Rindy giggling in other room)

352
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,920
I just wanted
to say thank you, really.

353
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,844
Of course.

354
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,082
Well, what I wanted
to say was...

355
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,248
do you get a lunch hour there?

356
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,925
Well, let me take you to lunch.

357
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,360
It's the least I can do.

358
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,931
Well, yes, I...

359
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,770
Of course, but you
really don't have to.

360
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,763
- I'm free tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

361
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,803
Do you know Scotty's on Madison?

362
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,685
No, I don't know it.
Hold on.

363
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,645
Could I borrow

is argue about this?

MAN (over radio): The two men had left...
- (bell dings)

1271
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,850
...Knoxville, Tennessee
last night and the driver said

1272
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,241
Williams, who was in
his late 20s,

1273
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,526
had not been feeling well.

1274
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:56,284
- WOMAN: You the folks in 42?
- Mm-hmm.

1275
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:57,566
We're checking out.

1276
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:59,245
Telegram come for you
last night.

1277
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,687
(over radio): The exact cause
of Williams' death

1278
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:03,245
- (engine starts)
- will be determined after...

1279
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,890
When did this arrive?

1280
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,281
Early. 7:00, 9:00.

1281
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:08,965
I ain't a clock, lady.

1282
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,246
(over radio): The elderly
composer's home

1283
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,880
was in Montgomery, Alabama.

1284
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,963
(gasps)

1285
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,490
Where is my suitcase?

1286
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25,847
- I put it in the back.
- I want my fucking suitcase!

1287

THERESE:
Carol, what's going on?

1288
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:29,443

1289
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:32,444

1292
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,206
Carol, you're scaring me.

I'll give you double, triple,

I wish I could oblige you,
ma'am,

1297
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:15,884
but the tapes have already
been sent to your husband.

1298
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,445
CAROL:
That-that can't be right.

1299
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,126

1300

1301
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:25,369
How do I know you're not lying?

1302
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:29,126
You don't, ma'am.

1303

1306

How could you?

1307
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:51,561
I'm a professional,
Miss Belivet.

1308
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:52,801
It's nothing personal.

1309
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:58,566
Let's get out of here.

1310
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:05,361
CAROL:
No, we left.

1311
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,124
There's nothing you can do.

1312
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:08,930

your telegram.

1313
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:10,684
ABBY (over phone): What did
the travel agent tell you?

1314
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:12,530
That the earliest flight
into LaGuardia

1315
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:14,210
is tomorrow afternoon.

1316
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:15,646
ABBY:
Tell me what you need.

1317
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:16,847
Oh, Abby.

1318
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,002
I don't know how to fix this.

1319
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:20,844
I haven't the strength.

1320
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,923
(Abby speaks indistinctly)

1321
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:34,044
What are you thinking?

1322
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:35,651
(sighs)

1323
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,167
Do you know how many times
a day I ask you that?

1324
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,129
I'm sorry.

1325
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:41,884
What am I thinking?

1326
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,970
I'm thinking that
I'm utterly selfish and I...

1327
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,326
Don't do this.

1328
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,289
You had no idea.
How could you have known?

1329
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:51,922
And I should've said no to you,
but I never say no.

1330
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:55,846
And it's selfish, because...

1331
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,365
because I just take everything,

1332
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:59,170
and I don't know anything,

1333
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:01,129
and I don't know what I want,
and how could I

1334
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:03,282
when all I ever do
is say yes to everything?

1335
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:05,369
(Crying softly)

1336
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:23,289
I took what you gave willingly.

1337
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:32,363
It's not your fault,

1338
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,443
Therese.

1339
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,523

Thank you, darling.

1342
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:57,361
ABBY (over phone):
So, how are you now?

1343
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,090
CAROL:
Oh, you know.

1344
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,044
Shattered, sickened.

1345
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,083
ABBY: Don't worry. We'll figure
this out, I promise you.

1346
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,049
I hope so.

1347
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:06,440
ABBY:
Anything else you need?

1348
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:08,409
No, no, talk tomorrow.

1349
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:09,920
- Try and get some sleep.
- I will.

1350
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,490
- And don't worry.
- Thank you.

1351
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,563
- Good night.
- Good night.

1352
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:17,603

1353
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:22,922
You don't have to sleep
over there.

It's completely different.

1378
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,327
I've known Carol
since I was ten years old.

1379
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:22,529
It was five or so years ago.

1380
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:24,444
Summer.

1381
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:27,251
Late one night, my Ford...

1382
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,926
broke down near
my mother's house.

1383
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:35,649
We tried to stay up...

1384
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:37,325
but curled up together

1385
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,608
in my old twin bed.

1386
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,683
And that was it.

1387
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:45,403
For a while.

1388
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,127
And then it changed.

1389
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:53,203
It changes.

1390
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:56,409
Nobody's fault.

1391
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,288
So...

1392
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:09,771
What?

1393
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:14,165

Dearest,

1396
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:33,803
there are no accidents,

1397
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:37,407
and he would've found us
one way or another.

1398
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:42,122
Everything comes full circle.

1399
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:44,886
Be grateful it was sooner

1400
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,964
rather than later.

1401
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:50,726
You'll think it harsh of me
to say so,

1402
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:54,726
but no explanation I offer
will satisfy you.

1403
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,211
Please don't be angry

1404
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,408
when I tell you
that you seek resolutions

1405
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:06,406
and explanations
because you're young.

1406
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:09,962
But you will
understand this one day.

1407
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:27,209
(coughing)

1408
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:38,487
And when it happens,

1409
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:42,964
I want you to imagine me there
to greet you,

01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:45,248
our lives stretched out

a perpetual sunrise.

1412
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,289
But until then,

1413
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,960
there must be no contact
between us.

1414
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:07,805
I have much to do,

1415
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:11,089

anything to see you happy.

What happened?

1446
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:57,963
Oh, nothing.

1447
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:02,323
It's hard to really...

1448
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:04,801
Is this because I tried
to kiss you that day?

1449
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:07,042
Because if it is,

1450
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,320
don't even think about that.

1451
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:09,805
You don't have
to be afraid of...

1452
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:11,883
I'm not afraid.

1453
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:21,122
Let's finish while
we still have light, okay?

1454
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,606
Still think you should
put together that portfolio.

1455
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:32,240
Okay.

1456
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,846
The world and we have passed
the midway point

1457
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:37,884
of a century
of continuing challenge.

1458
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:40,168
JENNIFER:
More mashed potatoes, Carol?

1459
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,209
Oh, yes, thank you.

1460
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:44,488
They were delicious.

1461
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,123
- HARGE: Here you are.
- Thank you.

1462
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:51,521
HARGE:
Thank you, Cate.

1463
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:54,729
EISENHOWER: This fact defines
the meaning of this day.

1464
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,484
We are summoned,

1465
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:58,722
by this honored
and historic ceremony...

1466
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:01,611
I had thought, perhaps,

1467
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:03,728
that-that Marge and Chester

1468
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:05,723
would be back by now
with Rindy.

1469
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:07,530
Marge said to go ahead,

1470
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:09,603
not to wait.

1471
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:12,441
I'm sure that

1472
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,523
they'll be here soon.

1473
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,080
Harge tells us you've been
getting along quite well

1474
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:22,368
with your doctor, Carol.

1475
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:23,960
And why shouldn't
she get along well?

1476
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:25,963
He's a very expensive doctor.

1477
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:29,283
Well, actually,
he's not a doctor.

1478
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:31,363
He's a psychotherapist.

1479
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:35,726
Well, he's very well regarded.

1480
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:38,406
A Yale man, like your uncle.

1481
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,403
Yes, but that doesn't
make him a doctor.

1482
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:44,531
EISENHOWER: ...and their vast
empires have disappeared.

1483
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:48,526
New nations have been born.

1484
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:50,489
For our own country,
it has been a time...

1485
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:52,324
But I do like him very much.

1486
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,801
He's been a great help.

Oh!

1491

Look how much you've grown.

1492
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:10,167
Oh!

1493
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:12,243
Can you give me a big squeeze?

1494
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:16,847
Oh, that's a long trip.

1495
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,844
You must be hungry, sweetheart.

1496
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,809
Want to come have

of the charges,

a series of events precipitated
by my client's husband

1550
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:00,571

these tapes - All right, Fred,

of their inadmissibility.

1555

I want to see these
depositions, and secondly, I...

Harge...

1564
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:26,771
I want you...

1565
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:28,843
to be happy.

1566
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:30,610
I didn't give you that.

1567
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:32,569
I... I failed you.

1568
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:36,520
I mean, we both
could have given more, but...

1569
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:39,206
we gave each other Rindy,

1570
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:43,160
and that is
the most breathtaking,

1571
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:45,527
the most generous of gifts.

1572
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:49,202
So why are we spending
so much time

1573
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:51,886
trying to keep her
from each other?

1574
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:55,808
Now, what happened
with Therese...

1575
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:57,325
I wanted.

1576
01:40:57,480 --> 01:41:00,563
And I will not deny it,

1577
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:03,007
or say that I...

1578
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:04,770
But I do regret,

1579
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:07,890
and I grieve for the mess
we are about to make

1580
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:10,082
of our child's life.

1581
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:13,289
We, Harge,
are both responsible.

1582
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:18,683
So I think I...
we-we should set it right.

1583
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:24,929
Now, I think that Harge

1584
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:26,730
should have custody

1585
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:28,803
- of Rindy...
- FRED: Could I suggest we just take a break

1586
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,325
- for a moment?
- CAROL: No! (several talking)

1587
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:31,851
Fred, will you let me speak?

1588
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,490
Because if you don't,

1589
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:35,881
I will not be able to c-cope.

1590
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:38,401
Now, I'm no martyr.

1591
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:40,608
I have no clue
what is best for me.

1592
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:43,081
But I do know,
and I feel it in my bones,

1593
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:44,691
what is best for my daughter.

1594

(sniffles softly)

1596
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:49,169
Now, I want visits
with her, Harge.

1597
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:50,810
I don't care
if they're supervised.

1598
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:53,008
I just want them to be regular.

1599
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:57,442
Now, there was a time...

1600
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,409
when I would have done
almost anything,

1601
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:01,767
I would have
locked myself away...

1602
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:04,400
(sniffles, pants)
to keep Rindy with me.

1603
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:06,403
(sniffles)

1604
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:08,210
But what use am I to her...

1605
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:11,728
to us, if I'm living
against my own grain?

1606
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:14,690
(sighs, sniffles)
So that's the deal.

I won't... I cannot
negotiate anymore.

we go to court.
