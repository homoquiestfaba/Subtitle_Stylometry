FOR THIS GUY.

343
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,068
HE'’’S BEEN DATING HIS
SEXYHITMANCOSTAR
SERENA HILL.

344
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,137
SERENA. OH, GOD.

345
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,338
OH, SERENA--SHE'’’S
A GREAT WOMAN.

346
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,141
SHE'’’S TOTALLY
REFRESHING,

347
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,943
AND, UH, I'’’M
CRAZY ABOUT HER.

348
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,945
WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY?

349
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,547
THAT'’’S PROBABLY AL
L I SHOULD SAY,

350
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,149
YOU KNOW
WHAT I'’’M SAYING?

351
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:14,953
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?

352
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:15,754
WHY CAN'’’T I MEET
SOMEONE NICE?

353
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,539
THERE'’’S NOTHING
WRONG WITH YOU,
NORA.

354
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:19,258
YOU JUST GO OUT
WITH THE WRONG
PEOPLE.

355
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,793
STOP DATING ACTORS.
THEY'’’RE CRAZY.

356
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:23,495
NO, THAT'’’S
ACTRESSES.

357
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,898
I SHOULDN'’’T GO OUT
WITH ANYONE ANYMORE.

358
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,100
I'’’M GOING HOME.

359
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,104
HEY, DON'’’T FEEL BAD.
THAT GUY'’’S A JERK.

360
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,105
I LOVE YOU.

361
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,973
ME, TOO.

362
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,391
OK, I'’’LL CALL YOU.

363
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:37,392
OK.

364
00:19:41,897 --> 00:19:42,898
OH, GOD.

365
00:19:42,898 --> 00:19:45,400
POOR NORA.
SHE HAS THE WORST
TIME WITH MEN.

366
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,401
YOU KNOW,
I LOVE NORA,

367
00:19:46,401 --> 00:19:47,903
BUT SHE HAS NO
INSIGHT WHEN IT
COMES TO MEN.

368
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:48,904
SHE DOESN'’’T
UNDERSTAND THE HUNT.

369
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:50,906
MEN LIKE
A CHALLENGE.

370
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:52,908
LIKE A BITCH,
LIKE ME?

371
00:19:56,912 --> 00:19:58,330
KINDA.

372
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,715
YOU THINK I'’’M A BITCH?

373
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:03,218
COME ON, BABY.
DON'’’T FIGHT ME
ALL THE TIME.

374
00:20:03,218 --> 00:20:04,720
I THINK YOU'’’RE GREAT.
I WORSHIP YOU.

375
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,722
I PUT YOU
ON A PEDESTAL.

376
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:08,223
LIKE AN OBJECT.

377
00:20:08,223 --> 00:20:09,708
SHUT UP.

378
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:40,839
HONEY, DO YOU FEEL
ALL RIGHT?

379
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,174
YOU LOOK PALE.

380
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,343
I'’’M OK.

381
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,745
YOU DON'’’T THINK
YOU SHOULD SEE
THE DOCTOR?

382
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:48,380
NO. NO. I'’’M FINE.
REALLY.

383
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,048
THANK YOU, THOUGH.

384
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:51,250
I'’’VE JUST BEEN
WORKING TOO HARD

385
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,020
AND JUST DRINKING
TOO MUCH, SMOKING
TOO MUCH.

386
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,923
YOU KNOW WHAT I HEARD
ABOUT YOUR LIVER?

387
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,359
YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE
ANYTHING TO DRINK

388
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,027
TWO DAYS A WEEK.

389
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:04,263
THEY DON'’’T HAVE TO
BE CONSECUTIVE.

390
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:08,634
AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW
SMOKING IS SUICIDE.

391
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:09,868
MM-HMM.

392
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:13,789
HOW ARE THINGS
WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND?

393
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:15,290
OH, IT'’’S OVER.

394
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,594
OH, IS THAT WHY
YOU'’’RE DEPRESSED?

395
00:21:23,598 --> 00:21:27,002
NO, THAT'’’S NOT IT.

396
00:21:27,002 --> 00:21:28,620
I JUST FEEL LIKE
I HAVE THE WORST
LUCK IN THE WORLD

397
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,689
WHEN IT COMES
TO MEN.

398
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:37,663
I THINK I MUST BE
DOING SOMETHING
HORRIBLY WRONG,

399
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:40,065
BUT I DON'’’T KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

400
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,067
WHAT HAPPENED?

401
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:45,203
OH, HE HAS
A GIRLFRIEND.

402
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:46,521
OH.

403
00:21:49,157 --> 00:21:51,943
YOU KNOW, I CAN'’’T
QUIT THINKING ABOUT

404
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:56,415
HOW HARD IT MUST BE
FOR YOUNG WOMEN NOWADAYS.

405
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:59,851
I MEAN, ON THE ONE HAND,
THE WORLD IS WIDE OPEN
TO YOU.

406
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,453
ALL THE CHOICES YOU WANT.

407
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,855
I THINK THERE ARE
TOO MANY CHOICES, REALLY.

408
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:06,758
IT JUST MUST BE
VERY CONFUSING

409
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,561
TO TRY TO FIND
A PATH THROUGH ALL OF THAT,

410
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,364
ESPECIALLY WITH MEN,

411
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:15,817
THOUGH YOU HAVE HAD
SOME VERY NICE BOYFRIENDS.

412
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:18,770
I KNOW...

413
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,772
BUT THAT WAS COLLEGE.

414
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,409
I DON'’’T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

415
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:30,015
I FEEL SO CLOSED OFF,

416
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,984
SO DESPERATE TO FIND
SOMEONE TO LOVE.

417
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:34,736
OH, HONEY.

418
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:37,756
EVEN I CAN'’’T STAND
THE SIGHT OF
MY OWN DESPERATION.

419
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:40,559
HONEY, HEY,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

420
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,994
YOU'’’RE IN A FUNK,
THAT'’’S ALL,

421
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:44,696
AND THERE'’’S ONLY
ONE WAY TO GET
OUT OF A FUNK,

422
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,698
AND THAT IS TO
ENGAGE.

423
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,868
EVEN IF YOU DON'’’T
FEEL LIKE IT,
JUST FAKE IT.

424
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,304
JUST GO OUT AND GET
THE HIGHEST HEELS IN TOWN

425
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:55,057
AND SOME NEW LIPSTICK
AND GO EVERYPLACE.

426
00:22:55,057 --> 00:22:56,558
[LAUGHS]

427
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:59,061
SMILE. ACT LIKE
YOU'’’RE HAVING THE TIME
OF YOUR LIFE.

428
00:22:59,061 --> 00:23:01,813
BUT DON'’’T ALWAYS GO
WITH MARRIED COUPLES.

429
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:04,216
YOU'’’RE NEVER GONNA
MEET ANYONE THAT WAY.

430
00:23:06,234 --> 00:23:08,520
SURE. I'’’LL GIVE IT
A TRY, YOU KNOW.

431
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,858
YOU KNOW...

432
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,761
I COULD FIX YOU UP.

433
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:16,578
NO.

434
00:23:16,578 --> 00:23:18,864
NOW, JUST LISTEN
TO ME FOR A MINUTE.

435
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:20,665
YOU KNOW MEGAN ROSS,
MY FRIEND.

436
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,068
SHE HAS A SON.
I DON'’’T THINK YOU'’’VE
EVER MET HIM.

437
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:26,271
NICE-LOOKING,
SUCCESSFUL,

438
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:30,959
AND I KNOW HE'’’S NOT
SEEING ANYONE
RIGHT NOW.

439
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:31,960
ARE YOU NORA?

440
00:23:32,461 --> 00:23:32,961
YES.

441
00:23:33,462 --> 00:23:33,962
I'’’M CHARLIE ROSS.

442
00:23:34,463 --> 00:23:34,963
HI.
HI.

443
00:23:35,464 --> 00:23:37,966
NICE TO MEET YOU.
YOU, TOO.

444
00:23:37,966 --> 00:23:41,970
IT'’’S PRETTY FUNNY
THAT OUR MOMS
SET US UP.

445
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:44,723
YOU DON'’’T KNOW
THE IRONY BEHIND IT.

446
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,359
I'’’M GLAD.

447
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,027
ME, TOO.

448
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,533
I HAVEN'’’T SEEN THIS
MOVIE IN A REALLY
LONG TIME.

449
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,034
IT'’’S ONE OF
MY FAVORITE FILMS.

450
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,536
YEAH? NO, I LOVE
THIS FILM, TOO.

451
00:23:58,036 --> 00:23:59,037
I'’’VE NEVER SEEN IT
IN A THEATER, THOUGH.

452
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,540
REALLY?
YEAH.

453
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,659
UH, SHOULD WE GO IN
AND GET SEATS?

454
00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:05,660
YEAH.

455
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:15,353
Woman: YESTERDAY,
ABOUT 3 P.M.

456
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,355
I WANTED YOU TO THINK
ABOUT IT TWICE, TOO.

457
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,357
[ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING]

458
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:27,532
Man: I'’’VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR SOMEONE FOR
A LONG TIME.

459
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,020
I LOVE THAT MOVIE.

460
00:24:32,521 --> 00:24:34,372
IT REALLY HOLDS UP.

461
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:37,325
BOGART REMINDS ME
OF MY DAD.

462
00:24:37,325 --> 00:24:38,827
I MET YOUR DAD ONCE.

463
00:24:38,827 --> 00:24:40,829
HE SEEMED LIKE
A GREAT GUY.

464
00:24:40,829 --> 00:24:41,830
M.
I'’’M SORRY ABOUT HI

465
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:44,833
YEAH, ME, TOO.
I REALLY MISS HIM.

466
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:47,836
I FEEL LUCKY TO HAVE
HAD HIM AT ALL, REALLY.

467
00:24:47,836 --> 00:24:50,338
NOW MY MOM HAS IRVING,
SO SHE'’’S NOT ALONE.

468
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:54,843
YEAH. MY MOM DOESN'’
’T REALLY DATE ANYONE
ANYMORE.

469
00:24:54,843 --> 00:24:55,844
SHE WENT THROUGH
A STRING OF THEM

470
00:24:55,844 --> 00:24:57,162
AFTER MY PARENTS
DIVORCED,

471
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,564
BUT SHE ALWAYS
DRIVES THEM AWAY,

472
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:02,350
ON PURPOSE,
I THINK.

473
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:05,370
I WONDER IF WE ALWAYS
TURN INTO OUR PARENTS.

474
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:09,374
I LIKE TO THINK
OF IT AS WHERE MY
PARENTS LEFT OFF.

475
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,543
THAT'’’S A GREAT WAY
OF PUTTING IT.

476
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,249
OH, SHIT.

477
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:18,049

HI, JENNIFER.

491
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,385
MY MOM WAS--

492
00:25:37,385 --> 00:25:39,387
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

493
00:25:39,387 --> 00:25:40,889
WILL YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR ONE SECOND?

494
00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:42,390
I'’’M SORRY.

YOU SAID YOU WEREN'’’T
DATING ANYBODY.

500
00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:48,780
Charlie: I'’’M NOT
DATING ANYBODY.

501
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,649
SHE'’’S THE DAUGHTER
OF MY MOM'’’S FRIEND.

502
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,485
I THINK I BROUGHT
HER HERE BECAUSE I...

503
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,321
I WAS MISSING YOU,
AND THIS REMINDED ME
OF OUR FIRST DATE.

504
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:59,324
DON'’’T TOUCH ME.

WHAT HAPPENED?

509
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,621
WE HAVEN'’’T BEEN
BROKEN UP THAT LONG.

510
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:16,374
IT'’’S--IT'’’S BEEN
REALLY HARD.

511
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:22,948
YOU'’’RE ACTUALLY
THE FIRST PERSON I'’’VE
DATED SINCE JENNIFER.

512
