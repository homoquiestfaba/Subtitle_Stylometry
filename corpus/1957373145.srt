He needs new sneakers.

You're still using the mortar and pestle?

Of course. That's how you make mole.

63
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,516
I told you to try it with the blender.

64
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:13,851
That'll make it bitter.

No. Wanna know my dad's secret?

66

-What?
-As soon as you take the tomatoes

67
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:22,818
out of the pan, you blend them right away
and it's not bitter.

Sir, remember telling me
about the kitchen position?

That when Pedro left, it was my turn.

My nephew just moved back here

79

and I had to give the job to him.
Gotta help the family, you know.

But I've been waiting a year.

81
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:06,236
Yeah, but some people wait four
or five years to set foot in the kitchen.

82
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,905
Deal with it. That's all.

83

I went to the culinary institute.

I gave your landlord a hand job.

She left with a guy from Building 21.

They have some easy job
in a flower shop or something.

112

And she sends a lot of money
to her family.

113
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:23,248
Her dumbass brother bought
a truck in Ecatepec.

114

Pretty much.

I could have taught you how to pass.

00:32:19,231 --> 00:32:21,149
I wore this around when I was 8 years old.

357
00:32:22,943 --> 00:32:24,403
Can you imagine? [chuckles]

358
00:32:28,699 --> 00:32:29,741
[man whistles]

359
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:32,369
[indistinct chatter]

360
00:32:34,997 --> 00:32:37,332
-Who's responsible?
-I don't know, sir.

361
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:39,126
-I'll check.
-Don't say, "I don't know."

362
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:40,586
He has a bad temper, huh?

363
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,484
What's that?

364
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:08,030
Your father's going to catch us.

365
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:11,491
He's too old.

366
00:33:11,575 --> 00:33:13,327
He wouldn't make it up the stairs.

367
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:44,733
-That's good.
-Thanks, Mom.

368
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:50,155
[Magda] You're late.

369
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:53,242
[Iván] Good evening.

370
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:54,993
I'm Iván.

371
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:56,703
Good evening.

372
00:33:58,956 --> 00:33:59,831
Hi, Dad.

373
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:03,335
[boy] He's Gerardo's best friend.

374
00:34:08,966 --> 00:34:10,842
[César] How many cows gave birth today?

375
00:34:10,926 --> 00:34:11,802
Two, Dad.

376
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:15,389
The black one's about ready,
keep an eye on her.

377
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:16,723
Yes, Dad, I'll check her.

378
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:19,685
[César] The coffee's cold.

379
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:22,228
You know I like it burning hot.

380
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:30,404
What's that you're wearing?

381
00:34:35,701 --> 00:34:36,618
You don't like it?

382
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:38,911
No.

383
00:34:51,382 --> 00:34:52,676
What do you do for work?

384
00:34:53,302 --> 00:34:54,344
[Gerardo] He's a chef.

385
00:34:55,012 --> 00:34:55,846
No.

386
00:34:57,347 --> 00:34:58,265
[Gerardo] He's a cook.

387
00:34:59,183 --> 00:35:01,935
No. I help out in a kitchen.

388
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:03,604
I wash the dishes.

389
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:05,355
[César chuckles]

390
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:09,735
[Angelica] In my house,
the maid washes the dishes.

391
00:35:09,818 --> 00:35:11,236
[Magda] Angelica...

392
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,864
[César] That's woman's work, right?

393
00:35:21,747 --> 00:35:22,831
When are you leaving?

394
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:23,999
Early tomorrow.

395
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:26,210
[César] Hm.

396
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:30,339
[Magda] Let them be.
They probably have things to do.

397
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:32,841
[Iván] Yes, ma'am,
we have to go back to work.

398

[Magda speaks indistinctly]

401
00:36:09,253 --> 00:36:10,379
[César] Let's go.

[door closes]

403
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,225
[young Gerardo] Dad?

404
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:26,520
[footsteps approaching]

405
00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:35,904
Get up. Get up!

406
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,700
-Dad?
-[César] Shut up!

407
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:08,020
-Where are we going?
-[César] I said, shut up.

408

[sobbing]

409
00:37:16,612 --> 00:37:17,696
Are you going to tell me?

410
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:25,621
Aren't you a man?

411
00:37:26,496 --> 00:37:27,331
Huh?

412
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:32,419
Eh?

413
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:37,299
Don't you think I'm ashamed
that everyone in the village

414
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:39,384
is saying this shit?

415
00:37:40,886 --> 00:37:43,138
Didn't I teach you to be a man?

416
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:49,102
Why do you act
like a fucking little girl? Huh?

417
00:37:51,355 --> 00:37:54,107
Everyone is saying you're a faggot.

418
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,445
-Is that what you are?
-No, Papa.

419
00:37:58,529 --> 00:38:00,113
So why are they saying it?

420
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:01,698
I don't know.

421
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:11,416
Do you know what happens
to people like you?

422
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:15,087
They get killed.

423
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:17,965
And they get tossed into the mountains.

424
00:38:20,217 --> 00:38:21,844
Is that how you want to end up?

425
00:38:22,344 --> 00:38:23,679
No.

426
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:33,355
Stay here and learn what'll happen
if you keep acting like this.

<i>It's about the rent.</i>

433
00:40:30,764 --> 00:40:32,224
Iván, you still haven't paid him?

434
00:40:33,475 --> 00:40:34,476
[Iván] I'm on it.

435
00:40:35,978 --> 00:40:38,772
I told you, I can lend you
the money again, no problem.

436
00:40:39,273 --> 00:40:40,566
And I told you no.

437
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:42,693
Well, it's up to you.

-[doorbell buzzes]
-[Rosa Maria] Iván, are you there?

440
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:16,894
It's my mom.

441
00:41:20,606 --> 00:41:21,899
Your mom, here in Puebla?

442
00:41:21,982 --> 00:41:23,525
She's here with my kid and Paola.

443
00:41:24,902 --> 00:41:26,987
-So?
-They're going to want to come up.

444
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:29,740
I'm your friend from work, right?

445
00:41:36,038 --> 00:41:37,039
[Rosa Maria] Iván!

446
00:41:56,558 --> 00:41:57,476
Hi, Mom.

447
00:41:59,478 --> 00:42:00,896
Ricky, what happened?

448
00:42:00,979 --> 00:42:02,773
I fell at school.

449
00:42:03,732 --> 00:42:05,859
-[Iván] Does it hurt?
-Yeah.

450
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,283
Where were you?
He fell on Thursday and broke his arm.

451
00:42:13,784 --> 00:42:16,411
[Paola] I panicked, so I called your mom.

452
00:42:17,162 --> 00:42:18,455
Where were you?

453
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:22,376
[Iván] Some friends from work
invited me to Hidalgo.

454
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:26,380
It was a last-minute thing.

455
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:29,091
I'm sorry. I should've let you know.

456
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,010
The boy's better now.

457
00:42:33,095 --> 00:42:35,889
But he insisted on seeing you.
He wanted to see his dad.

458
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:39,768
Ricky, how about we go to Sanborns
and get an ice cream?

459
00:42:39,852 --> 00:42:41,728
[Ricky] Yes, ice cream!

460
00:42:42,479 --> 00:42:43,647
[Rosa Maria] It's raining.

461
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,482
Can we use your bathroom?

462
00:42:46,108 --> 00:42:48,735
-Ricky needs it.
-It's broken.

463
00:42:49,361 --> 00:42:50,863
It's not working. There's no water.

464
00:42:53,615 --> 00:42:55,492
[Rosa Maria] Iván, why can't we come in?

465
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,995
[Paola] Who's up there?

466
00:43:00,497 --> 00:43:01,999
Mom, you just can't come in.

467
00:43:06,545 --> 00:43:09,047
Is it that guy you're always with?

468
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:16,889
What are you talking about?

469
00:43:19,057 --> 00:43:22,477
-Let's go.
-But I want my ice cream.

470
00:43:22,561 --> 00:43:24,062
It's late. Come on.

00:43:25,147 --> 00:43:27,024
-Come.
-Mom, wait.

472
00:43:28,025 --> 00:43:29,318
I knew it.

473
00:43:31,111 --> 00:43:33,572
I don't want you coming near Ricky or me.

474
00:43:34,865 --> 00:43:36,283
Paola, he's my son.

475
00:43:38,911 --> 00:43:40,829
You have nothing to offer us.

476
00:44:22,162 --> 00:44:23,288
I'm going home.

[ominous music playing]

478
00:45:09,543 --> 00:45:10,627
Take that off.

479
00:45:17,426 --> 00:45:19,303
Your mother worked hard on it.

00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:08,727
What's going on, Iván?

482
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:10,938
What are you doing here?

483
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:14,983
What time are you coming home?

484
00:46:16,735 --> 00:46:20,280
Late. I told you, I have to wait
until my boss gets back from Cholula.

485
00:46:20,364 --> 00:46:21,490
Okay, I'll be waiting.

486
00:46:22,157 --> 00:46:24,201
-Don't be late.
-Hmm.

487
00:46:30,415 --> 00:46:31,458
What is it, Chulito?

488
00:46:33,418 --> 00:46:34,336
What happened?

<i>Pluck chickens?</i>

Pick grapes or whatever the fuck
they pick in California?

493

Avocados?

494
00:47:42,446 --> 00:47:45,657
Iván, we're gay.

495
00:47:45,741 --> 00:47:47,201
We don't pick avocados.

496
00:47:49,995 --> 00:47:52,706
I have better opportunities there
to become a chef.

497
00:47:53,999 --> 00:47:56,668
I'm talented,
and they love talent over there.

498
00:48:01,215 --> 00:48:02,049
Thank you.

499
00:48:05,052 --> 00:48:06,094
We're fine here.

No, we aren't fine.

You're fine.

502
00:48:14,853 --> 00:48:15,854
Come with me.

503
00:48:21,068 --> 00:48:22,110
They hate us over there.

504
00:48:22,736 --> 00:48:25,030
Then why does everyone
who goes there end up staying?

505
00:48:27,658 --> 00:48:31,286
This whole bullshit dream is just because
your mom caught you with your boyfriend.

506
00:48:32,454 --> 00:48:33,372
Grow up.

507
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:39,670
I need to move Ricky forward.
I need to move myself forward.

508
00:48:54,184 --> 00:48:55,394
I need to leave.

No, she can do it.

-[Iván in English] Sorry. We open at 5:00.

-[woman] Oh, okay.
-[Iván] Sorry.

Iván...

888
01:29:40,005 --> 01:29:42,674
I don't see myself living
in Mexico right now.

889

I just can't see it.

[woman] Gerardo!

895
01:31:38,457 --> 01:31:39,291
[in English] Hey.

896
01:31:40,292 --> 01:31:41,793
-I just--
-[woman whoops]

897

I want just to be very quick, so quickly.

898

No, just-- You know,
I going to practice my Spanglish.

900
01:31:55,307 --> 01:31:58,685
So thank you so much
for being here, all of--

901
01:31:58,769 --> 01:32:03,232
So many beautiful faces
since like, uh, ten years ago,

902
01:32:03,315 --> 01:32:06,068
-like before the Twin Towers.
-[man] Thank you.

903
01:32:06,151 --> 01:32:09,988
I can see friends, like,
when we were working together

904
01:32:10,072 --> 01:32:12,824
in different restaurants,
like 12 years ago...

905
01:32:12,908 --> 01:32:13,742
[woman] Wow.

906
01:32:13,825 --> 01:32:15,077
...cleaning tables.

907
01:32:15,577 --> 01:32:17,287
And now I still cleaning tables

908
01:32:17,371 --> 01:32:19,414
-but your tables!
-[crowd laughs]

909
01:32:19,498 --> 01:32:20,666

913

[in Spanish] Tonight...

914
01:32:35,138 --> 01:32:38,016
I've achieved one of my dreams,

915
01:32:39,017 --> 01:32:42,104
which is to see
this place filled with our friends.

916
01:32:42,771 --> 01:32:47,150
We created this place
not just with ourselves in mind,

917
01:32:47,234 --> 01:32:50,362
but thinking about the neighborhood,

918
01:32:50,445 --> 01:32:54,157
thinking about our friends
and our families.

919
01:32:55,033 --> 01:32:58,412
And for the Mexicans
who came here seeking opportunities.

920
01:32:59,413 --> 01:33:00,747
[all cheering]

921
01:33:00,831 --> 01:33:02,916
[Iván] Thank you, thank you, thank you.

[Iván]<i> </i>This is so painful.
It's really killing me,

929
01:33:47,586 --> 01:33:50,881
not being able to be there.

930
01:33:51,590 --> 01:33:54,301
Not being able to say goodbye to him,
to my own father.

[priest in Spanish] For our families
who stayed behind in our countries,

935
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:58,175
we ask you, Lord,
please don't let us forget them.

936
01:36:00,219 --> 01:36:05,432
We ask that you bring hope and patience
to our illegal brothers and sisters.

937
01:36:05,516 --> 01:36:10,687
Grant us the strength
to overcome the abuses of racism.

938
01:36:10,771 --> 01:36:11,980
We pray to you.

939
01:36:12,523 --> 01:36:14,983
Long live the Latino immigrants!

940
01:36:15,067 --> 01:36:16,318
[crowd] Long live!

941
01:36:17,110 --> 01:36:19,780
[priest] Long live all the immigrants
in this country!

942

[crowd] Long live!

01:36:30,749 --> 01:36:32,125
[man singing in Spanish]

944
01:36:51,979 --> 01:36:54,815
I have a son in Mexico who's 20 years old.

945
01:36:55,816 --> 01:37:00,863
And so I want to travel to Mexico.
I haven't seen him in many years.

946
01:37:01,405 --> 01:37:05,284
So... I don't want to leave
this country forever

947
01:37:05,367 --> 01:37:07,870
because I have the businesses,
because...

948
01:37:08,412 --> 01:37:12,624
I don't want to close the restaurants
and leave 80 people without a job.

949
01:37:13,792 --> 01:37:18,672
I'm not asking
for residency or citizenship.

950
01:37:18,755 --> 01:37:23,677
All I want is permission to travel
and return here to continue working.

951
01:37:24,428 --> 01:37:26,597
[in Spanish] But even with all that,

952
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:29,308
even though you have a business
and employees...

953
01:37:31,268 --> 01:37:35,939
because you entered
without documentation

954
01:37:36,023 --> 01:37:39,151
and because you've been here illegally,

955
01:37:40,110 --> 01:37:42,946
there's no path.

956
01:37:43,030 --> 01:37:45,032
[dramatic music playing]

957
01:38:09,223 --> 01:38:12,059
It's like being trapped in a cage.

958
01:38:12,142 --> 01:38:17,231
Honestly, I'm not happy. I'm not.

959
01:38:22,653 --> 01:38:25,113
But there are many other people, Iván,

960
01:38:26,865 --> 01:38:28,283
whose lives are destroyed...

961
01:38:29,785 --> 01:38:31,828
and with much worse problems than us.

962
01:38:43,215 --> 01:38:44,258
Oh, no.

963
01:38:46,510 --> 01:38:48,220
There's nothing else to do but to go on.

964
01:38:54,393 --> 01:39:01,316
It can't be that a country can destroy
the bond between a father and a son.

965
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:02,734
Or between a family.

966
01:39:06,738 --> 01:39:08,156
I don't think it's worth it.

967
01:39:11,285 --> 01:39:13,245
And it's going to split us apart.
