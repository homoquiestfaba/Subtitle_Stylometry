I'm gonna...
[sighs]

1044
00:56:41,476 --> 00:56:43,946
- Okay.
- Yeah, I'm sorry, bro.

1045
00:56:49,618 --> 00:56:52,188
Have a wonderful date,

Spare key. Hmm.

1047
00:57:03,165 --> 00:57:05,034
Hmm...

[lively pop music]

00:57:09,238 --> 00:57:11,674
See, it doesn't work with Coke.
It has to be a milkshake.

1050
00:57:11,707 --> 00:57:14,276
- Well, I'm lactose intolerant.
- God, that's hot.

1051
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:16,579
What,
that I'm lactose intolerant?

1052
00:57:16,612 --> 00:57:18,214

He has these um,
Ring Pops on his hand.

1060
00:57:39,235 --> 00:57:40,870

what the fuck you're doing.

Yeah, my life's kind of,
kind of messed up.

Well, I just meant at the farm.
I didn't mean...

Oh.

Yeah, still.

Sarah, we make sense together.

about to hit the chorus, dude.

get out of here, so...

- Take the first swing.
- I don't want to fight.

- What did you say?
- Yeah, that's right.

grandpa couldn't hold on

to the farm,
and neither will your daddy.

Oh, you don't know,
do you?

01:00:12,221 --> 01:00:14,790
My dad just got a call
from developers today.

the farm and tear it down.

- Yeah, that's right.

meeting with them tomorrow.

up with the cash before then...

- Chaz! No!
- I'm okay.

1127
01:00:35,277 --> 01:00:37,313
Oh, my god, I think
I got a rock in my eye.

1128
01:00:37,346 --> 01:00:39,415
Can you look in my eye?
It's really,

1129
01:00:39,448 --> 01:00:41,951
- I don't think it's... ah!

do with my Insta story?

When are we going
to do about the farm?

1137
01:01:13,549 --> 01:01:15,017
I don't know.

1138
01:01:16,018 --> 01:01:17,319
I can speak to my dad.

1139
01:01:20,322 --> 01:01:23,058
Woah, kiddo. You okay?

1140
01:01:23,092 --> 01:01:25,427

Yeah, I'm okay.

1142
01:01:27,263 --> 01:01:30,432
What, uh, what happened
to your nose?

1143
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:32,835
Got hit by
a wannabe Gucci model.

1144
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:36,438
Are you
uh, care to elaborate?

1145
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:39,108
Not really.

1146
01:01:39,676 --> 01:01:41,543
I'm going to
go grab some air.

1147
01:01:49,418 --> 01:01:52,021
What really
happened to your nose?

1148
01:01:52,354 --> 01:01:53,455
You're stupid.

1149
01:01:56,892 --> 01:02:00,529
Dad, I got to know the truth
about the farm, about grandpa.

1150
01:02:03,198 --> 01:02:05,067
Your grandfather
was a, was a complicated guy.

1151
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,102
Then it's true,
he was a gambler.

1152
01:02:12,074 --> 01:02:13,509
It was a secret.

1153
01:02:13,809 --> 01:02:17,546
It was a big secret, really.

1154
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:20,949
He, uh,
He had an addiction.

1155
01:02:20,983 --> 01:02:25,254
And one night
he lost a huge bet.

1156
01:02:25,821 --> 01:02:27,923
And he didn't have
the cash to cover it.

1157
01:02:29,491 --> 01:02:32,595
- So he had to give up the farm.
- You can't be serious.

1158
01:02:33,095 --> 01:02:37,032
Before he died, he made
me promise him that...

1159
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,401
I'd buy the farm back.

1160
01:02:40,102 --> 01:02:43,606
So, uh...
that's what I have been doing.

1161
01:02:44,106 --> 01:02:47,009
Slowly paying it off
over the past few years.

1162
01:02:47,476 --> 01:02:50,879
- That's why you left mom and I.
- Yeah.

1163
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:53,482
Why didn't you say so?

1164
01:02:53,515 --> 01:02:55,384
I didn't want to hurt
your grandfather's pride.

1165
01:02:55,417 --> 01:02:57,019
So why tell me now?

1166
01:02:59,121 --> 01:03:01,090
Because...

1167
01:03:01,658 --> 01:03:04,493
I thought it was more important
to tell the truth.

1168
01:03:06,061 --> 01:03:07,963
Dad, you're gonna
lose the farm.

1169
01:03:07,996 --> 01:03:09,932
Oh, hey, I mean, it's going
to be a little difficult to get

1170
01:03:09,965 --> 01:03:12,067
- over the baler incident...
- No, developers are buying it.

1171
01:03:12,501 --> 01:03:13,636
What?

1172
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:15,137
Chaz told me.

1173
01:03:15,805 --> 01:03:17,906
His dad's
meeting them tomorrow.

1174
01:03:19,408 --> 01:03:21,210
And they're going to
tear it down.

1175
01:03:23,245 --> 01:03:25,080
You know, if you would have
told me you're going to

1176
01:03:25,114 --> 01:03:26,949
lose the farm a month ago
I wouldn't have cared.

1177
01:03:26,982 --> 01:03:28,651
[chuckles]
Shit, I'd probably be happy.

1178
01:03:30,419 --> 01:03:34,056
But now, I can't help to think
that this is entirely my fault.

1179
01:03:34,523 --> 01:03:36,291
I mean, if I wasn't so stupid
with the baler...

1180
01:03:36,325 --> 01:03:39,995
Kiddo, kiddo, kiddo,
slow, slow down.

1181
01:03:40,362 --> 01:03:43,165
[somber music]

1182
01:03:43,198 --> 01:03:46,135
[car approaching]

1183
01:03:52,474 --> 01:03:53,710
What are you doing here?

1184
01:03:53,743 --> 01:03:55,411
Look at my
beautiful boy's face.

1185
01:03:55,612 --> 01:03:57,546
You need to get control
of that little shit of yours.

1186
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:59,448
- Alright John...
- How's he supposed to do his

1187
01:03:59,481 --> 01:04:02,551
- Gucci commercial next week?
- There he is, Dad.

1188
01:04:02,585 --> 01:04:04,420
You need to keep your
grubby little hands

1189
01:04:04,453 --> 01:04:06,255
off of my angel,
you hear me?

1190
01:04:06,288 --> 01:04:08,557
Alright, I think the name
calling is a bit excessive.

1191
01:04:08,591 --> 01:04:11,093
You know, your son is going
to end up just like you.

1192
01:04:11,126 --> 01:04:15,030
Broke, alone, and at the bottom
of the food chain.

1193
01:04:15,931 --> 01:04:18,701
No, I think it's time that you
get the fuck off my property.

1194
01:04:18,735 --> 01:04:20,436
- Your property?
- Yeah.

1195
01:04:20,469 --> 01:04:21,537
Ha...

1196
01:04:22,237 --> 01:04:23,939
You're not going
to get away with this.

1197
01:04:25,675 --> 01:04:28,177
Oh, I will.
I will.

1198
01:04:28,645 --> 01:04:30,312
[Chaz] He will.

1199
01:04:32,782 --> 01:04:34,651
Dad,
can you unlock the door?

1200

[optimistic music]

1201
01:04:44,359 --> 01:04:47,529
God. There must be something
we're not thinking of.

1202
01:04:48,397 --> 01:04:50,667
Well, I'm all out of ideas.

1203
01:04:53,235 --> 01:04:54,604
[deep exhale]

1204
01:04:57,674 --> 01:04:59,508
[Sarah]
Well, you clean up nice.

1205
01:04:59,541 --> 01:05:02,110
What? Oh, thanks.

1206
01:05:02,144 --> 01:05:04,079
Felt like a new shirt
would make me feel better.

1207
01:05:04,112 --> 01:05:06,348
I was really talking about
the bloodless face, but...

1208
01:05:06,381 --> 01:05:07,717
Ah, yeah.
That, too.

- That's my dad's horse.

that all your semen money...

theoretically, all that cash
belongs to your father.

Looks like your dad's
not losing the farm.

1402

Well, it is his
liquid gold, after all.

1403

- You're welcome.
