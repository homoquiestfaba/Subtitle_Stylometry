I know how to cook, Isaac.
It's just, uh,

not a passion of mine.

502
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:52,467

out of the house.

Look. (EXHALES)
Listen, they're weird,

524
00:31:23,425 --> 00:31:25,260
but they haven't done
anything wrong exactly.

525
00:31:25,327 --> 00:31:27,629
That creepy boy is looking
at Anna in a way I don't like.

526
00:31:27,729 --> 00:31:29,531
- Right.
- And how did he know where the candles are?

527
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:31,199
Okay, listen,
we will finish dinner

528
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:33,102
and then we will tell them
we're going to bed.

529
00:31:33,168 --> 00:31:34,202
Can't we get them out faster?

530
00:31:34,603 --> 00:31:36,471
Hey, You're the one that said
we shouldn't piss them off.

531
00:31:38,273 --> 00:31:39,474
Fine. (SIGHS)

532
00:31:39,641 --> 00:31:42,711
I... I want them gone
the minute we finish eating.

533
00:31:43,245 --> 00:31:44,881
I don't want Anna
alone with them.

534
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,784
Oh, shit, uh,
we forgot the matches.

535
00:31:47,884 --> 00:31:49,786
Here, come on. I'll tell
them we couldn't find 'em.

536
00:31:51,921 --> 00:31:54,322
ANNA: Mom, Dad, Isaac just did
something really cool.

537
00:31:54,857 --> 00:31:57,759
- What, he found matches?
- No, he touched the candles with his finger

538
00:31:57,827 --> 00:32:00,362
and they just lit up.
Can you do that trick again?

539
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:02,965
Oh, I'll show you
a lot more tricks, Anna.

540
00:32:06,368 --> 00:32:09,204
Isaac, um,
John and I were talking

541
00:32:09,271 --> 00:32:12,708
and we're grateful for the meal,

542
00:32:13,076 --> 00:32:15,243
but we're really tired
after the drive

543
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:18,447
and we're going to bed early,
right after dinner.

544
00:32:18,714 --> 00:32:21,249
And I... I just wanted you
and your grandpa to know.

545
00:32:21,583 --> 00:32:24,352
(CHUCKLES) Wow, Grandpappy.
You hear that?

546
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:26,055
They're inviting us
to stay the night.

547
00:32:26,155 --> 00:32:28,157
- No, I... I... I...
- We're touched, ma'am.

548
00:32:28,623 --> 00:32:31,760
No one's ever invited us to stay
in a house like this before.

549
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:37,834
I... I'm not inviting you
to stay the night. I'm...

550
00:32:38,935 --> 00:32:41,703
I'm saying that
you have to leave after dinner,

551
00:32:42,604 --> 00:32:43,705
if not sooner.

552
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:46,441
But we brought
ice cream for dessert.

553
00:32:47,076 --> 00:32:48,710
Well, we'll eat it
when you're gone.

554

ISAAC: Oh, come on.

555
00:32:53,749 --> 00:32:54,649
What did we do?

556
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:57,820
I know there's enough room
in this house for all of us.

557
00:32:58,121 --> 00:33:00,123
Six bedrooms,
if I'm not mistaken.

558

That's not counting
the game room

559

or the bonus room...

560
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,763
or even that locked room
you can't get into.

561
00:33:08,663 --> 00:33:10,298

You fainted.
You had another nosebleed.

I have to wash my face.

583
00:34:15,798 --> 00:34:17,934
Oh, it's fine.
I've seen blood before.

584
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:20,236
- Much more than that.
- You need to leave.

you want that, ma'am.

If Isaac isn't your grandson,

706
00:38:58,347 --> 00:38:59,381
then who is he?

707
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:04,787
(SIGHS) He just
sort of appeared one summer.

708
00:39:05,653 --> 00:39:07,156
Walked right out of the bayou.

709
00:39:08,858 --> 00:39:12,627
Said his parents had died,
left him a bunch of money.

710

(SIGHS) Never even told me
his last name.

711

But he didn't have
no place to live.

712

Didn't have no possessions.

713
