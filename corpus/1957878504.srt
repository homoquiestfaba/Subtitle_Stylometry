our being sex objects for men

we grew up on,

People need time to learn 
new things and grow,

and if after that, 
they don't show growth,

568

that's, I think, 
when the cancelation

may come into--to play, 
but in the meantime,

570
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:43,221
we really need to be 
a little bit more forgiving

because we don't wake up

you know what I mean?

I don't have the right

693

and everyone's like,

694

"You're bad for doing this. 
You're bad if you do that.

695
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:27,839
You're just bad. 
You're terrible."

696
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,174
And I come here, 
and I watch you,

697
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:31,476

fuck, she is free.

you just did, but, like,

I need to understand 
what you just did.

701
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:39,117
It's not even really, 
like, about the pole.

702
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,853
It's more about what has that 
unleashed inside of you?

703
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:46,124
And for me, growing up, 
I was raised very Mormon.

704
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:48,993
My value as a human being 
and as a person

705
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:53,198
and as a woman 
depended on me staying pure

706
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:55,333
and being pure in my body.

707
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:58,503
And for a long time, 
I really believed that.

708
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,472
I spent so much 
of my teenage years

709
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:05,243
trying to think of myself 
as a non-sexual person,

710
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,846
because if I was sexy, 
that meant my worth

711
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,515
as a human being 
was less in the eyes of God.

712
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:14,786
When I was 19, I moved to 
Los Angeles to be an actress.

713
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:18,089
I didn't make it. 
I started doing nude modeling,

714
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:21,092
and then I shot 
my first porn scene.

715
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,661
Um, when I was 19, 
I was still a virgin.

716
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:26,397
So many people hear that story 
and think,

717
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:28,600
"Oh, that's so sad," 
but I had

718
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,002
an amazing experience 
in pornography.

719
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:32,237
For the first time, 
I was around people

720
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,372
who weren't judging me,

721
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:37,375
and nobody's kindness 
depended on me being pure,

722
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,711
and it was like this 
huge weight had been lifted,

723
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:43,848
and I could start being more 
embodied in who I am.

724
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:47,218
I don't feel like 
I have to be pure.

-But I also...

the truth is,

00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:53,591
I sleep with who I feel like 
sleeping with.

728
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:57,428
I feel free to do that, 
but at the same time...

729
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:59,798
Do you feel full from the--

730
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,933
from the people who you 
have relationships with?

731
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:04,435
Do you feel that you are 
a better version of yourself

732
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:07,105
with those people?

733
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,274
You understand sexuality 
in your head,

734
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:12,310
but maybe not in your body.

735
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,814
It's like lawyer-smart 
versus pole dancer-smart.

736

how can we get you 
out of your head

738
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,719
and more into your body?

739
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:24,088
Because those two things 
are deeply interconnected.

740

Yeah, but, Nereida, 
decrim as I understand it

1024
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,770
just means not criminalizing 
women in the sex industry.

1025

1026

be punished.

1027

Sarah, what you're describing 
is partial decriminalization.

1028
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:25,149
But the movie studio 
is pushing for full decrim.

1029
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,084
That's different 
than just stopping women

1030
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:28,586

1031
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:30,221

actually ends up

and guys like these.

1033
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:35,659

goes to jail, they get to go

of traffic school

1035

on the wrist.

1036
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:41,165
If you stay out of trouble, 
your case will be dismissed,

1037
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,801
and more importantly, 
your record will be clean.

1038

Look, I told you, I'm not 
picking one side or the other.

00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,976
[laughs] I know. I recognize 
you from the picture.

1180
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:27,344
Thank you for doing this. I...

1181
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,812
-Hi. 
-This is Cassandra.

1182
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:30,514
-Hi. 
-Nice to meet you.

1183
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,582
Let her know if you need 
anything, all right?

1184
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:33,150
Thank you so much. 
This is Ra--

1185
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,818
-Rashid. 
-God. Yo!

1186
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:36,286
I can't believe you remember 
my name, son.

1187
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:37,521
Yeah, yeah.

1188
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,523
This... 
I'm in a dream right now.

1189
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,792
Like, slap me. Nah-- 
Don't slap me, though.

1190
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:43,160
Like, yo! [laughs]

1191
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,896
Um, we don't wanna take 
much of your time.

1192
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:47,431
How about I take you 
on a tour,

1193
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:48,699
and we'll see where 
the journey goes? All right?

1194
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:51,134
Oh, my God. Yes. 
I would love that.

1195
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:52,269
So he said, 
you know what I'm saying?

1196
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:54,638
If I need anything, 
I wanna know

1197
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:56,740
if there's something I need,

1198
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,742
is something you could 
provide, do you feel me?

1199
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:00,177
I know you have 
so many slashes--

1200
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:03,847
music and also 
the adult industry.

1201
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:08,385
And I'm really curious about 
this idea of empowering women.

1202
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:11,221
Like, how women can 
use their own power

1203
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,924
to be in this industry.

1204
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:16,460
Me, coming from music 
as an artist,

1205
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,729
you--you're never really 
in control of your career.

1206
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,564
And all these companies 
made all this money

1207
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,299
from the talent,

1208
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:24,534
and the talent 
they made the least,

1209
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:27,404
and I saw it 
as a clear disconnect,

1210
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,072
because I was talent myself, 
so--

1211
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,641
So you performed in--I'm not 
gonna go watch your stuff,

1212
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:33,010
but you performed...

1213
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:34,978
I've been performing on camera 
for about 20 years.

1214
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:36,914
I've done a few thousand 
scenes, yeah.

1215
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,215
You've done 
a few thousand scenes.

1216
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:39,316
-Yeah. 
-So you got to be

1217
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:41,018
a sex worker yourself. 
-Yeah.

1218
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:42,185
Do you consider yourself 
a sex worker?

1219
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:43,687
I consider myself 
a sex worker, sure.

1220
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:45,088
I think that a lot of people

1221
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,957
have it really wrong 
about sex workers,

1222
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:49,059
so I saw an opportunity 
to connect people

1223
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:50,394
who make their own content

1224
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:52,429
with the people who want 
that content,

1225
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,731
and when-- 
when it came together,

1226
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:57,067
it was like 
a business explosion

1227
00:48:57,067 --> 00:49:01,038
because suddenly, these 
once-exploited sex workers

1228
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:05,509
or porn stars who were being, 
you know, offered

1229
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:06,843
maybe a small amount 
of the share,

1230
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:09,112
now earn 80% of the money, 
you know?

1231
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,881
So you're saying the-- 
you're basically helping,

1232
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:13,784
and I'm thinking 
especially about women,

1233
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,887
instead of having to give 
all their money

1234
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:19,356
that they earned 
to some company,

1235
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:21,725
they're keeping the vast 
majority of it for themselves.

1236
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:23,560
Right. We just provide 
a vehicle--technology,

1237
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,063
and we also act 
as a marketing partner.

1238
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:27,798
'Cause we only make money 
if they make money.

1239
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,933
So you've been able 
to build all of this,

1240
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:33,603
but what do you say 
to people who would call you,

1241
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:35,272
I don't know, 
like a modern-day

1242
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:38,241
digital pimp or something?

1243
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:39,843
It's funny. 
Tucker Carlson called me out

1244
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:42,546
as a--some type of 
modern-day pimp,

1245
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:44,247
which I thought 
was really funny.

1246
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:45,582
I never thought my name

1247
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:46,817
would be mentioned 
on Fox News, but--

1248
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,051
I never thought 
I would say anything close

1249
00:49:48,051 --> 00:49:49,786
to what Tucker Carlson says, 
but okay.

1250
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:51,054
Well, I mean, nothing could be 
further from the truth.

1251
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:54,925
We pay out millions of dollars 
to mostly women

1252
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:58,095
who are using 
their own decisions,

1253
00:49:58,095 --> 00:50:01,898
their own choices as adults 
legally

1254
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:05,302
to make 
usually pretty tame videos

1255
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:07,971
or sexy videos or whatever 
they're interested in making.

1256
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:09,673
And it's incredible, 
'cause I've seen girls

1257
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,808
who are in at-risk situations,

1258
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:13,944
and now they have 
their own apartment and a car

1259
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:16,446
and health insurance, 
and they, like,

1260
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:20,183
they're entrepreneurs, 
and their business is them.

1261
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:24,521
See, this idea that this is 
the kind of thing that would

1262
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,457
lift women who need support

1263
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:30,260
and can't find it working 
at Walmart or whatever,

1264
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,429
out of their situation, 
that's what I'm interested in.

1265
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:33,964
[dog barking]

1266
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:36,299
You know, 
women have been objectified

1267
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:39,302
and kept in a box because 
of their sexuality by men.

1268
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:42,272
Hey, hey, sweetheart. Yes, 
that's right. You're a woman.

1269
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:43,940
Sweetheart, 
do you feel kept in a box?

1270
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,343
So you Evan's girlfriend, 
and you Evan's girlfriend.

1271
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:49,379
You also Evan's girlfriend.

1272
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,214
I'm just saying, I'm--I'm a 
little overwhelmed right now.

1273
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,783
-That's all. 
-[laughter]

1274
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:54,084
Imma keep my hands 
where I can see 'em myself,

1275
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:55,452
you know what I'm saying? 
So y'all can see 'em,

1276
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:57,888
but I also need to see 
my own hands right now.

1277
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,923
You know what I'm saying? 
A little bit.

1278
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:01,224
After 20 years 
in the adult business,

1279
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,326
I see a huge paradigm shift 
in power.

1280
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:07,464
The women who have all 
the fans have all the power.

1281
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:10,300
They don't need to be 
affiliated with some company.

1282
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:13,870
See, I could see myself 
getting, I don't know.

1283
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:17,040
I'm not saying I'm ready 
to be an adult--

1284
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,843
Listen, anybody who 
follows you on social media,

1285
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:22,979
if you made a post 
on your social media and said,

1286
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:26,850
"Hey, I've now got 
some exclusive sexy content,

1287
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:29,119
and if you would like 
to subscribe,"

1288
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,887
you wouldn't believe how many 
people would pay

1289
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:33,557
for the curiosity of what 
you might be into sexually,

1290
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:35,225
and you know what?

1291
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:37,894
You might be an exhibitionist 
who is really turned on

1292
00:51:37,894 --> 00:51:41,098
in sharing this, and there's 
something very empowering

1293
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,533
about doing something 
that turns you on

1294
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:45,936
and then being 
financially rewarded for it.

1295
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,438
You know, 
people wanna shame you

1296
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,874
for what feels good 
and what feels natural.

1297
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:52,442
Like, what's wrong with us 
as a society?

1298
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:55,212
We promote violence, and we 
give our kids video games,

1299
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:56,613
and we're seeing carjacking,

1300
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,682
and this is 
part of the vernacular,

1301
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:01,685
but if anybody sees a boob, 
we're all in trouble.

1302
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:04,254
I get it. I mean, I still 
have so many questions.

1303
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:06,857
-Let's continue. 
-All right.

1304
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:09,259
Have you had to deal 
with people saying

1305
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:11,628
what's empowering, what's not? 
This is gorgeous, by the way.

1306
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,130
-Thank you. Um... 
-Yeah.

1307
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,698
We deal with judgment 
all the time.

1308
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:17,634
I mean, I've heard some of 
our models on the site say,

1309
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:20,036
"Hey, man, anybody who's not 
paying my bills

1310
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:23,240
doesn't have a right to judge 
how I make my living."

1311
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,443
I love that attitude, and I 
want to have that attitude.

1312
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:28,411
People are gonna judge 
whatever you do.

1313
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:30,447
And that's why I wanted 
your advice.

1314
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:31,748
I just think you have 
a really unique perspective

1315
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:33,250
on this whole thing.

1316
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,285
Well, listen, if you wanna 
become informed,

1317
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:36,553
you might wanna head out 
to Vegas.

1318
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:38,321
The Sex Industrial Revolution 
Conference

1319
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,990
is going on right now.

1320
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,791
I'm one 
of the keynote speakers.

1321
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,059
-I'll set you up with a pass. 
-Oh, my God.

1322
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:45,595
And you can inform yourself, 
you know?

1323
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:49,266
Okay. 
I mean...yeah! I wanna do it.

00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:51,668
-Vegas, baby. 
-What's happening to me?

1326
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:03,914
Yeah, I hear you, Nereida, 
but I keep thinking

1327
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:05,849
about what you said, Bella.

1328
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,484
I mean, what side would Naomi 
have been on?

1329
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:09,853
-Exactly. Thank you. 
-Wait.

1330
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,022
This means they scheduled 
the conference

1331
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,658
Evan told me about 
right next to a...

1332
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:16,293
Yup, anti-trafficking 
conference.

1333
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:19,162
-Yo no puedo. 
-This is gonna be like a war.

1334
00:53:19,162 --> 00:53:20,864
It's gonna be fine.

[indistinct conversations]

00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:24,601
Wait, Sarah, I'm-- 
I'm just saying.

1337
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:26,503
You know where you're gonna 
get reliable information

1338
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:28,138
and where you're not.

1339
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:29,539
Exactly. That is why 
I have prepared

1340
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,775
an entire itinerary for us. 
Just one second.

1341
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:34,611
I'm gonna put the SIR app 
right into your phone.

1342
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:36,146
I'm just gonna input 
all your info. One second.

1343
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:37,647
-Okay. 
-So they have better tech.

1344
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:39,849
Maybe that's because 
so many Silicon Valley guys

1345
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:42,319
spend most of their money 
on prostitution.

1346
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:45,655
Actually, I was gonna mention 
how sex workers unions are

1347
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:48,158
really changing the whole-- 
-Uh, would those be

1348
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:50,660
the sex workers "unions" 
run by pimps?

1349
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,729
Okay, Nereida, can you just 
let her finish?

1350
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,465
-[sighs] 
-Thank you.

1351
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:57,701
I was hoping this would go 
a little bit faster

1352
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:59,369
'cause I'm trying to get us in 
to see Alice Little.

1353
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:03,340
She's amazing. Union advocate. 
Sex worker millionaire.

1354
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,175
She's one of the most 
successful sex care providers

1355
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:07,877
in the world. Love her.

1356
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:10,013
Am I too late to sign up 
for Esperanza Fonseca?

1357
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:11,581
It was sold out. 
It still is on the app,

1358
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,383
but I think I can get us in.

1359
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:16,386
Let's just--Here are these, 
and here. Take that.

1360
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:18,822
And I think we'll be fine. 
Come on. Let's go.

1361
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:19,990
-Yeah. Come on. 
-Wait, Sarah.

1362
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,658
-Uh... 
-Okay.

1363
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:23,393
It's really, it's totally 
gonna open you up.

1364
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:24,561
-At least take these. 
-I'm just trying to keep

1365
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:25,996
my mind open. 
-Right, as usual.

1366

Refusing to land 
on either side of the issue.

1367
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,566
There's no integrity.

1368

You wanna be a hovercraft.

1369

This is not 
"The Mandalorian."

1370
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:38,441
I'm sorry we didn't get in.

1371
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:41,244
It's just, like, triggering me 
back to the time I was 12,

1372
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:42,679
and my dad got 
counterfeit tickets

1373
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:44,547
to the Pussycat Dolls.

1374
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:46,583
Yeah. If it wasn't meant 
to be, it's okay.

1375
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:49,019
Anyway, Nereida really 
wants me to see this woman,

1376
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:51,087
Esperanza Fonseca.

1377
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:54,291
She looks incredible. 
She's a Latina trans woman

1378
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,359
with experience 
in the sex industry herself,

1379
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:58,061
so you might-- 
you should come with us.

1380
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:00,430
She seems great. 
Like, that's amazing,

1381

Alice is like my she-ro.

-I understand. 
-Like--

1383
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:07,404
But you know, Bella, there's 
like a lot of people in here.

And she, like, invited me 
back to her brothel

for a private tour.

1394
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:38,735

we have our doctor's office. 
Come on in.

1444
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,559
I swear, when you said 
doctor's office,

1445
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:45,228
I was like, ooh, that sounds 
like a cool theme. [laughs]

1446

And you're like, no, it's 
an actual doctor's office.

1447
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:49,866
An actual doctor's office, 
though I suppose

1448
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:51,634
a little bit of kinky fun 
could certainly happen.

[laughs]

1450
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:56,039
I have to say that this is not 
the first thing I think of,

1451
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:57,807
and I think most people 
would say, like,

1452
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,709
"Oh, it's so dangerous. 
It's so..."

1453
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:01,478
But you actually have 
your healthcare

1454
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,780
right here on the premises.

1455
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,949
Such an important part 
of what this industry is.

1456
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:07,817
It's creating

1457
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:10,253
all of these opportunities 
for accessibility.

1458
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:12,589
How do you get 20 people 
to the doctor?

1459
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:14,791
Well, bring the doctor 
right to them. It's--

1460
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:17,260
These signs are on, 
like, every door.

1461
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,395
A very important feature 
of legality

1462
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:22,532
is that it does mandate 
condom and barrier use.

1463
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:25,101
Sex work is only legal 
here in Nevada.

1464
00:58:25,101 --> 00:58:27,837
So long as sex work 
remains a crime,

1465
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:31,241
legal brothels 
are the only safe spaces.

1466
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:33,009
I heard there's, like, 
a panic button in every room?

1467
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:35,812
Yeah. Oh, yeah. 
Just in case, of course.

1468
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:38,948
Right. Has it ever had 
to be, like, deployed?

1469
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:41,084
Only for medical emergencies.

1470
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:43,620
Yeah. All right. 
Let's keep going.

1471
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:46,856
You are providing the public 
with a service.

1472
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,558
-Do you see it that way? 
-Yeah.

1473
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:51,828
It's no different 
than any other service.

1474
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:53,496
We have doctors that take 
care of our physical health.

1475
00:58:53,496 --> 00:58:55,698
We have therapists that take 
care of our mental health.

1476
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:58,067
Who looks after 
our sexual health

1477
00:58:58,067 --> 00:58:59,502
and our sexual needs?

1478
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:01,371
Sex workers. 
That's what we do.

1479
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,639
Is there a world 
where everybody

1480
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,574
can achieve this level?

1481
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:06,676
Well, it's important 
to discuss privilege.

1482
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:08,311
There's all of the costs that 
come with getting started

1483
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:09,546
in this industry.

1484
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:12,148
You have to fly yourself 
out to Nevada.

1485
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:13,650
We pay for our own testing.

1486
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:16,519
We actually undergo 
a fingerprint requirement

00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:18,521
to work here legally.

1488
00:59:18,521 --> 00:59:20,790
Full background check, 
all of which we are required

1489
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:23,059
to pay ourselves 
every single quarter.

1490
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:26,396
Oh, my goodness.

00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:29,032
-Come on in! 
-Hey!

able to go all the way

1500
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:49,352
with a professional who's able 
to tie and suspend them

1501
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:53,222
or completely hold them down 
and tease them

1502
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:55,391
with, uh, electricity. 
-Aah! I heard "tease them,"

1503
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:57,527
and then we got 
to "electricity."

1504
00:59:57,527 --> 00:59:58,361
Well, it's only like

01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:22,438
that have decriminalized 
pimping and sex buying,

1672
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:24,640
you don't see a reduction

1673
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:27,710
in violence, in stigma, 
or in coercion.

1674
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,612
That's forcing women

1675
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:31,814
into the sex trade 
in the first place.

1676
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:35,518
As long as prostitution 
has existed,

1677
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:38,988
it has never been 
made up of women

1678
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:40,856
doing this out 
of their free choice.

1679
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:44,493
When the sex trade originated,

1680
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:48,464
most of those women were 
actually enslaved.

1681
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:51,867
A lot of people don't know 
the real history.

1682
01:07:51,867 --> 01:07:54,036
I think you should talk

1683
01:07:54,036 --> 01:07:57,173
to the original inhabitants 
of this land.

1684
01:07:57,173 --> 01:08:00,076
There's gonna be a gathering 
about murdered

1685
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:03,879
and missing indigenous women 
as part of this conference.

1686
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:08,517
Right. Vegas, Sin City. 
It's...This is native land.

1687
01:08:08,517 --> 01:08:12,888
They are the final frontier 
of facts on this issue.

She was like, yeah, 
think about Nevada.

1709
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,303
Think about where we are.

1710
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:04,173
So this is actually 
Shoshone and Paiute land.

1711
01:09:04,173 --> 01:09:07,243
And so a place like 
Las Vegas, Nevada,

1712
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:10,813
wouldn't be possible 
without the exploitation

1713
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:14,150
of native land, resources, 
and women.

1714
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,951
And, um, we know 
that native women

1715
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:18,587
are disproportionately 
trafficked,

1716
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:21,090
and it's because 
of extractive projects.

1717
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:23,425
It's because 
of gas and oil development.

1718
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:25,194
You might be familiar 
with man camps. Man camp--

-Yeah.

-Wait. Okay, hold on. 
-[laughter]

1721
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:31,333
-A lot of information. 
-What's a man camp?

1722
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:33,035
Whenever they're 
constructing a pipeline

1723
01:09:33,035 --> 01:09:36,405
or there's a big 
oil extraction project,

1724
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:40,142
um, the workers live 
on site in camps,

1725
01:09:40,142 --> 01:09:41,510
and have become called 
man camps.

1726
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:42,778
'Cause everybody who 
works there is a man.

1727
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:46,415
Yeah, typically and, um, 
those are hot spots

1728
01:09:46,415 --> 01:09:48,150
for sex trafficking,

1729
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:51,587
and so we know that when gas 
and oil extraction projects

1730
01:09:51,587 --> 01:09:53,956
come to our homeland,

1731
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:56,525
the rates of 
the disappearances and deaths

1732
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:58,827
and the trafficking 
of native women shoot up.

1733
01:09:58,827 --> 01:10:00,496
And when we're talking about 
the indigenous perspective,

1734
01:10:00,496 --> 01:10:02,464
I think we do need to look

1735
01:10:02,464 --> 01:10:04,466
beyond the North American 
perspective,

1736
01:10:04,466 --> 01:10:06,435
because First Peoples 
all over the world

1737
01:10:06,435 --> 01:10:09,438
are still subjected to 
the violence of the sex trade

1738
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:11,607
in countries that are 
so-called "developing."

1739
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:12,808
They're encouraged

1740
01:10:12,808 --> 01:10:14,810
by the 
International Monetary Fund

1741
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:17,079
to legalize the sex trade,

1742
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:19,782
um, so that their economies 
can be stimulated

1743
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:23,219
so that a sex tourism economy 
can be created,

1744
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,487
and we've seen projects 
like this happen

1745
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:28,724
in India, for example, 
and that's where, uh,

1746
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:30,392
one of the places 
where the term "sex work"

1747
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:34,330
was popularized, um, 
to push those endeavors.

1748
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:37,166
Wait. So you're saying 
official governmental--

1749
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:39,802
I don't know. Like the IMF, 
the World Bank--

1750
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:43,906
these are huge. You say they 
actually promote sex work

1751
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:46,809
as helpful to the economy 
of a country?

1752
01:10:46,809 --> 01:10:49,645
Yes. You know, it's no secret

1753
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:52,715
that certain women 
are fetishized, right?

1754
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:55,484
Asian women, native women, 
Black and Brown women,

1755
01:10:55,484 --> 01:10:58,153
and so places like that, 
when they are encouraged

1756
01:10:58,153 --> 01:11:00,990
to legalize the sex trade 
are marketed

1757
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:04,526
as a place where, you know, 
men from countries

1758
01:11:04,526 --> 01:11:07,096
in the First World can have 
access to the bodies

1759
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:09,064
of these poor women of color

1760
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:10,366
in countries 
in the Global South.

1761
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:11,900
It's usually white men.

1762
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,535
-Mm-hmm. 
-Mm-hmm.

1763
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:17,373
And the U.S. military has 
played a huge role in that.

1764
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:19,942
I mean, the whole idea 
of decriminalizing

1765
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:22,745
and women having a choice.

1766
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:26,215
Yeah, "choice" is definitely 
a word that we think we have.

1767
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:27,249
We think we have autonomy.

1768
01:11:27,249 --> 01:11:29,618
We think we have 
body sovereignty,

1769
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:32,321
but within the sex trade 
industry, like, coercion

1770
01:11:32,321 --> 01:11:35,758
really is, you know, huge 
with native women

1771
01:11:35,758 --> 01:11:37,259
and native queer 
and trans folks,

1772
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:39,628
like, we have 
the highest rates

1773
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:41,563
of domestic violence 
and sexual violence.

1774
01:11:41,563 --> 01:11:43,899
And so when you have 
all of those ingredients,

1775
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:45,434
especially at home 
as a young person,

1776
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:47,603
where are you supposed 
to turn to?

1777
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:49,805
How do you make a living 
for yourself?

1778
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:51,307
A lot of times 
these traffickers

1779
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,776
do make promises for you. 
They make you feel loved.

1780
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:55,544
They make you feel like 
you're the number one person.

1781
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:57,613
And so when you get that,

1782
01:11:57,613 --> 01:11:59,114
and you're not getting that 
at home,

1783
01:11:59,114 --> 01:12:01,950
it becomes a lot easier 
for you to get pulled into

1784
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:04,086
the sex trade industry.

1785
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:07,756
Like now, if a girl or woman 
needs to earn a living,

1786
01:12:07,756 --> 01:12:12,628
I just--I don't want anyone 
to be hurt further.

1787
01:12:12,628 --> 01:12:14,430
-You--You know what I mean? 
-Yeah.

1788
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:15,931
There are some people who say, 
"Look, I'm in this industry,

1789
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:19,201
and I wanna be there." 
How do you...

1790
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:21,503
Um, so I'm actively 
in the industry still.

1791
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:24,940
Um, and I think it's 
very easy for people

1792
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:26,241
who are rich 
and especially white

1793
01:12:26,241 --> 01:12:29,445
to say that it's a choice 
to be in it.

1794
01:12:29,445 --> 01:12:32,081
I've been trying to leave 
for the past year.

1795
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:35,918
And it's not easy. 
It's not--I feel like...

1796
01:12:35,918 --> 01:12:38,120
I feel like I'm trapped,

1797
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,356
and especially 
as a native woman,

1798
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:43,492
I had to ask myself if I was

1799
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:45,260
financially stable 
growing up,

1800
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:46,662
would I have even considered 
for a second doing

1801
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:49,498
this line of work, and I don't 
think I would have.

1802
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:53,035
It's been very, um, violent,

1803
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:54,403
and it's like 
I'm trapped in this.

1804
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:57,840
I-I don't see a way out 
even now.

1805
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,143
And I don't think that 
enough people realize

1806
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:04,546
how many native women are 
out there actively dying.

1807
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:08,183
So yeah.

1808
01:13:08,183 --> 01:13:11,320
Terria, thank you 
for telling me all that.

1809
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,655
I mean, how old were you 
when you...

1810
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:16,925
Um...

1811
01:13:16,925 --> 01:13:20,996
I was 17. Um...sorry.

1812
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:22,231
I don't wanna mess up 
my makeup.

1813
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,032
It's okay. Okay.

1814
01:13:24,032 --> 01:13:28,203
It was, like, a really small 
comment that changed my life.

1815
01:13:28,203 --> 01:13:31,073
I was talking 
to an older trans woman,

1816
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:33,375
and just offhand, she said, 
"Oh, my God.

1817
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:36,979
You're so pretty. You would 
make a killing on Backpage."

1818
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:38,380
And I asked her, 
"What's Backpage?"

1819
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,315
And she explained to me 
that it's a site where,

1820
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:43,252
you know, girls like us 
can make money,

1821
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:44,253
and so that night, 
I went home,

1822
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:48,557
and I posted my first ad, 
and it...

1823
01:13:48,557 --> 01:13:50,859
it was a very scary moment.

1824
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:54,463
I remember after I had 
my first client,

1825
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:57,466
I went into the bathroom, 
and I looked in the mirror,

1826
01:13:57,466 --> 01:14:00,536
and I started crying so hard 
that I threw up

1827
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:03,672
because all of a sudden, I--

1828
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:05,774
my body no longer 
belonged to me.

1829
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:07,476
It belonged to the systems

1830
01:14:07,476 --> 01:14:12,381
and place that I'm trying 
to survive under,

1831
01:14:12,381 --> 01:14:14,216
and I've been trying 
to survive under

1832
01:14:14,216 --> 01:14:18,353
for the past, what, six years.

1833
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:27,329
I think, um, when we talk 
about decriminalization,

1834
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:29,364
we're talking about 
the decriminalization

1835
01:14:29,364 --> 01:14:30,933
of prostituted people, 
trafficked people,

the pimps and johns, right?

1838

pimps and johns

with every other exploiter.

1840
01:14:39,174 --> 01:14:41,577
There's 
an inherent power imbalance,

1841
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:43,512
and in most native languages,

1842
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:45,581
there's not a word 
for "prostitution."

1843
01:14:45,581 --> 01:14:48,650
There's not a word 
for "pimp" or "john"

1844
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:50,986
because our societies 
do not enable

1845
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:54,156
a market for sex to exist,

1846
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:56,191
and we need to fight 
for a world

1847
01:14:56,191 --> 01:14:58,327

does not exist.

1848

simply continuing

1850
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:04,433

left behind.

your lost loved ones,

want you to do.

Well, the thing is, 
as far as us Pueblos and Diné,

1856
01:15:21,283 --> 01:15:23,819
like, we don't really 
call back our ancestors

1857

because we let them rest.

our past and our ancestors.

01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:39,394
So I thought I was asking 
some questions

2004
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:41,329
and exploring the topic,

2005
01:21:41,329 --> 01:21:44,132
but this is not about 
the movie.

2006
01:21:44,132 --> 01:21:47,836
I didn't realize I had 
my own truth to unpack.

2007
01:21:47,836 --> 01:21:51,373
"Sell/Buy/Date" was 
an exploration into the topic,

2008
01:21:51,373 --> 01:21:52,607
and it's just 
people's perception,

2009
01:21:52,607 --> 01:21:55,610
how they interpret it.

2010
01:21:55,610 --> 01:22:00,048
You are getting into flavors 
and textures that

2011
01:22:00,048 --> 01:22:02,951
make people uncomfortable 
in a large--

2012
01:22:02,951 --> 01:22:06,588
Aw. [laughs] It's true, 
and so in--in a way,

2013
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:08,757
rejoice in that.

2014
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:11,760
It's a really good time 
for that.

2015
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,662
It's a renaissance 
where we're not saying,

2016
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:15,363
what, you have to be this 
or you have to be this.

2017
01:22:15,363 --> 01:22:17,365
It's like you have to be 
whatever you--

2018
01:22:17,365 --> 01:22:19,067
is true to you.

2019
01:22:19,067 --> 01:22:22,404
I mean, I...Can I tell you 
a little story about me?

2020
01:22:22,404 --> 01:22:24,372
-Yeah. 
-Okay. Um...

2021
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:28,376
I have an association 
with this topic.

2022
01:22:28,376 --> 01:22:32,180
Way back when I was 
16 years old,

2023
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:36,818
I was a virgin, 
and I was part of kind of like

2024
01:22:36,818 --> 01:22:39,888
the Boy Scout group 
in Los Angeles,

2025
01:22:39,888 --> 01:22:41,856
and we went to Europe.

2026
01:22:41,856 --> 01:22:43,892
At 16, you're in Europe,

2027
01:22:43,892 --> 01:22:48,830
and the mores of sexuality 
are different.

2028
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:51,299
And there was a lot 
of conversation among

2029
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:54,269
friends of mine in the group 
that's saying,

2030
01:22:54,269 --> 01:22:56,104
"Oh, I'm gonna go 
to a house of prostitution."

2031
01:22:56,104 --> 01:22:58,306
And it scared me, obviously.

2032
01:22:58,306 --> 01:23:01,776
But I was also kind of 
curious about it.

2033
01:23:01,776 --> 01:23:05,981
So I was with a couple guys, 
and we were unchaperoned.

2034
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:07,449
And--And they said 
stay out of the bars

2035
01:23:07,449 --> 01:23:11,152
and stay out of the-- 
the red light district.

2036
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:13,688
And "Okay!" And we went 
right to the bars

2037
01:23:13,688 --> 01:23:16,925
and the red light district, 
and I copped out.

2038
01:23:16,925 --> 01:23:18,126
I didn't wanna get into it.

2039
01:23:18,126 --> 01:23:21,596
My two friends negotiated 
a price,

2040
01:23:21,596 --> 01:23:24,766
and I was just so nervous. 
I was shaking.

2041
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:27,402
And they--And they said, 
"What about you?"

2042
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:29,337
And I said, "Ah, no, 
I don't have the money.

2043
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:31,639
I don't have the money." 
I just...It just...

2044
01:23:31,639 --> 01:23:34,576
I was just so petrified.

2045
01:23:34,576 --> 01:23:38,847
So my two friends went off 
with their, um, escorts.

2046
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:42,484
And I sat in the foyer.

2047
01:23:42,484 --> 01:23:44,519
And then a woman came in 
and said,

2048
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:46,187
"How much? How much you have?"

2049
01:23:46,187 --> 01:23:47,489
I said, 
"No, I don't have enough."

2050
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:49,491
"No, show--show--show me."

2051
01:23:49,491 --> 01:23:51,893
And I said, "Look it's not--" 
And she took the money.

2052
01:23:51,893 --> 01:23:54,763
That's it. 
And she said, "Come on."

2053
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:57,165
And I went, oh, my God. 
I guess this is happening.

2054
01:23:57,165 --> 01:23:58,833
And we went 
into this one room,

2055
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:01,669
and it had a little single bed 
and a sink and a trash can.

2056
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:03,505
Oh, my God, Bryan.

2057
01:24:03,505 --> 01:24:08,109
[laughs] It was--I won't go 
into all the details of it,

2058
01:24:08,109 --> 01:24:11,846
but it was an experience 
that was over very quickly.

2059
01:24:11,846 --> 01:24:13,548
[laughs] Oh, my God.

2060
01:24:13,548 --> 01:24:17,886
It was...dispassionate, 
to say the least.

2061
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:19,988
It was a transaction.

2062
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:25,360
And I think back on it now,

2063
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:32,033
and I come away not 
feeling proud nor humiliated.

2064
01:24:32,033 --> 01:24:34,736
I-I'm kind of agnostic to it.

2065
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:37,739
It's just the truth. It's just 
what happened in my life as--

2066
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:40,341

I was growing up.

Yeah. Yeah.

2071

I'm just processing because...

2072
01:24:52,554 --> 01:24:54,589
I'm thinking of you at 16,

2073
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:58,693
and I'm remembering 
what my life was like.

2074
01:24:58,693 --> 01:25:00,895
At 12 and 13, 
I didn't understand

2075
01:25:00,895 --> 01:25:03,731
really any 
of what was going on.

2076
01:25:03,731 --> 01:25:07,335
And something that I-- 
it's really hard for me

2077
01:25:07,335 --> 01:25:09,671
to talk about, 
and maybe that's why

2078
01:25:09,671 --> 01:25:11,573
I did it through characters...

[exhales deeply]

2080
01:25:18,546 --> 01:25:19,714
Part of the reason I wrote 
"Sell/Buy/Date"

2081
01:25:19,714 --> 01:25:21,883
is my own sister.

2082
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:24,052
By the time she was 16,

2083
01:25:24,052 --> 01:25:26,421
she was in 
a transactional relationship

2084
01:25:26,421 --> 01:25:29,224
with an older man 
who was 27.

2085
01:25:29,224 --> 01:25:31,459
[voice breaking] 
He paid for her life.

2086
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:36,531
And she had drug issues 
and all kinds of other issues

2087
01:25:36,531 --> 01:25:39,200
that complicated 
her own relationship

2088
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:43,071
to money, sex, 
and her own power.

2089
01:25:43,071 --> 01:25:45,707
And, um, I've never 
wanted to talk about that.

2090
01:25:45,707 --> 01:25:49,944
It's incredibly difficult 
especially because

2091
01:25:49,944 --> 01:25:52,547
two years later, she died.

2092
01:25:52,547 --> 01:25:54,549
And I'm not saying it's 
because of prostitution

2093
01:25:54,549 --> 01:25:56,885
or transactional sex

2094
01:25:56,885 --> 01:26:01,389
or any of the things 
that she went through, but...

2095
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:06,294
Bryan, if you had known 
my sister,

2096
01:26:06,294 --> 01:26:10,932
she was the strongest, 
sweetest, most brilliant,

2097
01:26:10,932 --> 01:26:14,235
and I know if she had lived, 
she'd be one of these women

2098
01:26:14,235 --> 01:26:16,171
telling me, "I chose this. 
You don't have the right

2099
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:18,773
to tell me what to do 
or what not to do."

2100
01:26:18,773 --> 01:26:21,609
And she'd be right, 
but she's my sister.

2101
01:26:21,609 --> 01:26:26,447
And a part of me wonders, 
is it still a choice

2102
01:26:26,447 --> 01:26:29,050
if it's something you have 
to do to survive?

2103
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:33,154
Can you call that a choice? 
I don't know.

2104
01:26:35,323 --> 01:26:41,162
This feels like you had 
to go through this process

You can't separate that.
