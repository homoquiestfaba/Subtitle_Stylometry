1
00:00:01,584 --> 00:00:04,086
(jazz music)

2
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:57,932
(siren wailing)

3
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,196
(honking)

4
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:16,033
(engine puttering)

5
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:21,247
(slurping)

6
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,894
(muffled honking)

7
00:01:43,894 --> 00:01:46,397
(bell ringing)

8
00:01:47,773 --> 00:01:48,983
Julia.

9
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,484
Jake!

10
00:01:50,484 --> 00:01:52,361
Jesus, this is so weird.

11
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:54,864
- I know, it's a big city.
-Small world.

12
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,907
No, no, no, no, I was, uh,

13
00:01:56,907 --> 00:01:58,659
I was gonna call you, actually.

14
00:01:58,659 --> 00:01:59,910
-Really?
-Yeah.

15
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,704
Julia, that--that's great

16
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:02,455
because I've been thinking
about it.

17
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,831
Oh, I...

18
00:02:05,374 --> 00:02:07,918
I'm engaged.

19
00:02:07,918 --> 00:02:10,630
I wanted you
to hear it from me.

20
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,967
-Who is it?
-You don't know him.

21
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:17,136
It's a good thing,
be happy for me.

22
00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:18,095
No, don't do this, Julia.

23
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:19,639
Oh, you don't do this.

24
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,432
- I do not need this baggage.
-I promise...

25
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,684
Oh, God, after what
you put me through,

26
00:02:23,684 --> 00:02:25,936
I deserve all the happiness
I can get.

27
00:02:25,936 --> 00:02:28,314
I remember you used to say
that we were only happy

28
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,565
when we were being miserable
together.

29
00:02:29,565 --> 00:02:33,319
That's funny, I remember
you used to say that.

30
00:02:35,404 --> 00:02:39,533
Uh, look,
the wedding is in Aspen.

31
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:41,827
-Ugh.
-But some friends are giving us

32
00:02:41,827 --> 00:02:43,746
a going away party.

33
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,207
You can come
if you promise to behave.

34
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:49,543
Yeah, I'll behave
like exemplary baggage.

35
00:02:49,543 --> 00:02:50,461
For example,
I won't tell anyone

36
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,671
how your last boyfriend
dumped you

37
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,048
after you called him "Jake."

38
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,592
Oh, that is not what happened,
you jerk.

39
00:02:56,592 --> 00:02:59,220
He panicked when you told him
you had syphilis.

40
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,681
But you could've told him
the truth.

41
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,516
You just weren't over me.

42
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:07,478
Well, that's true,

43
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:10,898
but I had some help
and now I am.

44
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:17,738
How about you,
are you seeing anybody?

45
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:20,157
Yeah, sure, no,
I've been on a few dates.

46
00:03:20,157 --> 00:03:22,910
No, I mean therapy.
Are you seeing a shrink?

47
00:03:24,328 --> 00:03:26,080
Ugh, I gotta go.

48
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,374
I hope you're at the party.

49
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,376
(enigmatic music)

50
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,213
(honking)

51
00:04:02,616 --> 00:04:05,119
(dinging, buzzing)

52
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:10,207
(sighing)

53
00:04:10,207 --> 00:04:13,461
One, two...

54
00:04:15,337 --> 00:04:16,714
...three.

55
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,675
Please come in, Mr. Singer.

56
00:04:19,675 --> 00:04:21,135
Sorry I'm late, Doc.

57
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,596
This crazy fat woman
tried to avoid

58
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,432
paying for the bus.

59
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,268
Life in the city, huh?

60
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:38,778
(clearing throat)

61
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:51,457
Tell me, Mr. Singer...

62
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:56,086
why you think this woman,
if she exists,

63
00:04:56,086 --> 00:04:57,797
is so fat?

64
00:04:59,715 --> 00:05:04,720
I don't know,
maybe it's something glandular

65
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,180
or her metabolism.

66
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,101
So you're apologizing for her
and yourself, is that right?

67
00:05:12,853 --> 00:05:14,980
-What do you mean?
-"I suppose,

68
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,359
maybe, I guess."

69
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,986
Constructing passive sentences

70
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:22,947
is a way of concealing
your own testicles

71
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,366
lest someone cut them off.

72
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:28,160
-Why you laugh?
-Maybe it's because...

73
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,578
Again, "maybe."

74
00:05:29,578 --> 00:05:32,206
-You disavow your feelings.
- I do not...

75
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:36,252
You make from the world
a banal comedy,

76
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,962
and you are a spectator.

77
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,713
You even have a name for it;

78
00:05:39,713 --> 00:05:41,924
"Life in the City."

79
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,469
Bravo.

80
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:47,179
Doc, with all due respect,

81
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:48,597
I don't mean to question
your methods,

82
00:05:48,597 --> 00:05:50,808
but at $125 a pop--

83
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,185
And I appreciate
the sliding scale,

84
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:55,646
really, I do--
but all we ever do

85
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,940
is discuss my manners
and my dead mother

86
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,067
and she's been dead
quite a while.

87
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:01,610
We rarely discuss

88
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,404
my almost non-existent
sex life,

89
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:06,740
my ambivalence about my job,
my distrust of my boss,

90
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,826
my almost total lack
of communication

91
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,328
with my father.

92
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:12,705
Are you gonna stop me?

93
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,331
You can discontinue
the treatment

94
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:18,002
or continue with
this disputatious resistance

95
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,129
until your bank account
is drained.

96
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,673
It's the same to me.

97
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,676
Dr. Morales, I need
to reschedule our appointment

98
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,803
for next...

99
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:30,890
Okay, I am angry.

100
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,310
Oh, Jesus Christus, thank you

101
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,271
for this blood in the groin.

102
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,981
Why?

103
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,317
(soft violin music)

104
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,360
I saw Julia this morning.

105
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,240
She's gone for good.

106
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,576
She's getting married.

107
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:55,247
At last, the penis
has entered the vagina.

108
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:58,208
(bell ringing)

109
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,753
I just don't see
what the big deal is.

110
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,588
I mean, why did Chekhov
have to write

111
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,882
about such total losers?

112
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:07,384
Yeah, I mean like
that guy in the play,

113
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:09,887
he walks around moping all day

114
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:13,557
while his land rots
and his wife suffers.

115
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:16,852
Then some young beautiful girl
falls in love with him

116
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:18,520
and we're supposed
to feel sorry for him?

117
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,147
No way, that's ridiculous.

118
00:07:20,147 --> 00:07:21,982
Today we'd just give
the dude a Prozac

119
00:07:21,982 --> 00:07:23,609
and tell him
to get on with it.

120
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,819
I don't think the play
would ever have been written.

121
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:27,363
No, you're right, Phil,
why don't we just start

122
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,865
a whole new category
of literature

123
00:07:29,865 --> 00:07:32,201
that's been made irrelevant
by modern pharmacology?

124
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,536
We could start with Moby Dick.

125
00:07:34,536 --> 00:07:38,290
We'll just give Ahab a Zoloft
to take the edge off.

126
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,250
Invisible Man,
he's a Paxil candidate

127
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,544
-if I ever saw one.
-I'm not sure...

128
00:07:42,544 --> 00:07:45,047
What exactly do you want
from us, Mr. Singer?

129
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:48,342
For a start, I want you
not to process literature

130
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,719
like you're solving
an equation.

131
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,640
Chris, how do we define
"humanism"?

132
00:07:59,311 --> 00:08:02,606
"A belief in social
responsibility, individualism,

133
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:05,234
and the uses of sympathy
and the imagination."

134
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:08,237
Good. Walter, do you think
it's the point of drama

135
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,823
to portray characters
so that we can sit back

136
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,408
and judge them?

137
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,160
No.

138
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,580
We're supposed to, like,
feel what they feel.

139
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,082
Good.

140
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,501
Read.

141
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:25,838
"Sympatheia,
or emotional identification,

142
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,507
is necessary if we are to feel
pity or fear,

143
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:31,510
which are forms of pleasure.”

144
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:35,347
Aristotle prizes emotional power
over all else.

145
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:38,225
The playwright is offering you
an experience.

146
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:40,686
All I ask
is that you be open to it.

147
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:44,523
You have to imagine
that you could be Ivanov,

148
00:08:44,523 --> 00:08:46,066
that you could feel

149
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:50,070
that helpless
and that defeated,

150
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,697
and that someone else
could see the good in you

151
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,323
even though you clearly failed

152
00:08:53,323 --> 00:08:56,994
to make it manifest
in the world.

153
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,496
(soft music)

154
00:09:01,498 --> 00:09:04,001
So, um, is it okay
to take two extra days

155
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,169
for my essay, Mr. Singer?

156
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,713
Bye, Mom, I'm late.

157
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,590
-Bye.
-Mr. Singer?

158
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,216
What? Uh, yeah, sure, go ahead.

159
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:13,719
Just don't make a habit of it.

160
00:09:16,638 --> 00:09:18,640
(bell ringing)

161
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:22,561
-Can I help you?
-Yes.

162
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:26,065
I seem to have lost
my way here.

163
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,941
Well, me too, and I work here.

164
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,153
Where's the headmaster's office?

165
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,238
Ooh, what'd you do?

166
00:09:33,238 --> 00:09:37,201
-Uh, no, he's a friend.
-Really?

167
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,661
-Does he not have friends?
-No, no, no, he has friends.

168
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:44,374
I just didn't think
he had friends quite like you.

169
00:09:44,374 --> 00:09:49,004
Well, he's my, uh,
my husband's...

170
00:09:49,004 --> 00:09:52,591
My son is a student here.

171
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:55,385
Ah, so he's in trouble too?

172
00:09:55,385 --> 00:09:57,179
I don't think I got your name.

173
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,765
Jake Singer.
English and basketball.

174
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,184
Oh, I thought maybe you were
the hall monitor.

175
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,602
No, no, no, we've done away
with those,

176
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:06,939
including mandatory Latin
and corporal punishment.

177
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,774
I'm Allegra Marshall.

178
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,110
It is very nice to meet you,
Mrs. Marshall.

179
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,613
Uh, Proctor's office
is right down here.

180
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:17,199
So, I'm trying to get
more involved in the school.

181
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,243
Oh, that's great, um...

182
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:22,287
Prompted by anything
in particular?

183
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:26,208
Well, my, um, son's had
some difficulties,

184
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,001
but he loves school.

185
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:30,212
He's only eight,
and we're still very attached.

186
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,797
Well, these things
take cooperation.

187
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,507
There are a lot of parents
who would rather write a check

188
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,758
or have someone
write a prescription

189
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:36,760
to solve a problem.

190
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,387
I suppose you're right.

191
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:41,640
-Allegra.
-Leighton.

192
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,058
I see you've met Mr. Singer.

193
00:10:43,058 --> 00:10:46,812
Yes, we were exchanging
some potent ideas

194
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,188
about education.

195
00:10:48,188 --> 00:10:50,816
Well, I'd like
to hear them too.

196
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,318
Why don't you expand a bit
at Mrs. Marshall's next Sunday,

197
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:55,821
the benefactors' luncheon?

198
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,157
Mm, it's settled then.

199
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,994
Tell the others we'll start
in 15 minutes, Mr. Singer.

200
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,163
-It was nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

201
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,665
(cheering)

202
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,627
(shouting)

203
00:11:12,045 --> 00:11:14,214
(cheering, applause)

204
00:11:14,214 --> 00:11:16,842
Come on. Come on, don't let 'em
muscle you that way!

205
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,386
(buzzer, whistle shrilling)

206
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,766
Ladies...

207
00:11:24,766 --> 00:11:27,102
Ladies, you're getting killed
on both ends.

208
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:28,854
Huh?

209
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,064
You, Alex, I want you
to front your guy, all right?

210
00:11:31,064 --> 00:11:32,399
Get a body on him, he's big.

211
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,568
Don't be intimidated by him.

212
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,862
Come on, let's challenge
their zone a little bit,

213
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,739
get on the inside,
take it to the paint, all right?

214
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,074
Drive it a little bit,
all right?

215
00:11:41,074 --> 00:11:42,492
All right, for God's sake,
Walter,

216
00:11:42,492 --> 00:11:44,328
will you please get back
on defense, huh?

217
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,495
All right, let's go, come on.

218
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:48,290
Come on. One, two, three, work!

219
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,791
(buzzer)

220
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:52,252
Maybe you should ease up
a little bit on Walter.

221
00:11:52,252 --> 00:11:54,463
He's trying, but it's tough.

222
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,549
You know, if it was easy,
what would be the point?

223
00:11:57,549 --> 00:11:59,384
Why don't you stick
to the stats?

224
00:11:59,384 --> 00:12:02,012
Let me do the coaching.

225
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,056
Walter, get back on D.

226
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:07,142
(shouting)

227
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:09,519
That's it, hands up and swag.

228
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,107
Justin, you got to call
that pick!

229
00:12:14,107 --> 00:12:15,859
Call switch, come on.

230
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:18,362
(cheering)

231
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:26,078
(slapping, booing)

232
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,291
Back, back, back, back!

233
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,626
Everybody, back on the bench.

234
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:35,170
Right, right, right, Coventry,
walk away, walk away.

235
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,714
Come on, come on.

236
00:12:37,714 --> 00:12:39,466
Folks...

237
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,100
Well, naturally,
we're all concerned

238
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,894
about what happened
at the game yesterday.

239
00:12:50,894 --> 00:12:52,729
We're here to discuss
whether we ought to give

240
00:12:52,729 --> 00:12:55,065
Walter Cooper
the benefit of the doubt.

241
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,276
There's no doubt,
he did it on purpose.

242
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,361
He says he didn't.

243
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,696
He sent a kid to the hospital
last year.

244
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,323
No, no, no, that other kid
started with him.

245
00:13:03,323 --> 00:13:04,950
He's a year older
than his grade.

246
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,910
He's shown no feelings
for school.

247
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,954
Let's face it,
he's a time bomb.

248
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,789
He is smarter than
half of my kids,

249
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:13,792
and he says that you ignore him
in class, Bill.

250
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,294
I can't pull the answers
out of him.

251
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,712
I've got a class to run.

252
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,046
I had reservations
about Walter--

253
00:13:18,046 --> 00:13:20,924
Excuse me, it was you
who, after the interview,

254
00:13:20,924 --> 00:13:22,134
said we should give him
a chance,

255
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,094
that he's a fine,
upstanding young man.

256
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,095
We could give him
the opportunity

257
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,596
to rise above
his circumstances.

258
00:13:26,596 --> 00:13:31,268
Excuse me, I didn't know
I was speaking before the FBI.

259
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,856
(bell ringing)

260
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,567
We'll discuss this later.

261
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:44,614
Mr. Singer, in the future,

262
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:46,199
I'll expect
fewer contradictions

263
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:48,243
and more contributions.

264
00:13:48,243 --> 00:13:50,162
Just try and help us
keep him out of trouble,

265
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,997
and don't make me regret

266
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,416
asking you to speak
next Sunday.

267
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,710
(music starting)

268
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,919
I mean, what a hypocrite.

269
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:00,297
Proctor took this kid
for his shooting percentage,

270
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,424
and then he gets furious at me
for telling the truth?

271
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,634
-Outrageous.
-The man doesn't have

272
00:14:04,634 --> 00:14:06,345
an ounce of self-awareness.

273
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:11,099
I was speaking of you,
Mr. Singer.

274
00:14:11,099 --> 00:14:14,603
-I was outrageous?
-I'd have fired you on the spot.

275
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,146
Well, consider me fired.

276
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,315
Why is it every time
I think I'm getting somewhere

277
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,816
you pull the rug out
from under me?

278
00:14:19,816 --> 00:14:21,985
Because that is the way
you insist upon seeing

279
00:14:21,985 --> 00:14:25,781
the help that I'm trying
to give you.

280
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,407
You're a sadist.

281
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:30,452
You are an expensive sadist.

282
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:33,830
For the good Christ's sake,
Mr. Singer,

283
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,542
do you need to be told so badly

284
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:39,211
that I love you?

285
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,131
-You love me?
-Yes.

286
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,135
Now sit down, please.

287
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:53,475
Now, we are part
of the natural order,

288
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,061
primates,

289
00:14:56,061 --> 00:15:00,899
with hierarchies,
rituals of behavior.

290
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:05,404
Now most important
is the mounting behavior.

291
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,865
And this you see
most flamboyantly

292
00:15:08,865 --> 00:15:11,159
with baboons.

293
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:15,163
The dominant male mounts
not only the females

294
00:15:15,163 --> 00:15:17,624
but also the lower males.

295
00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:20,460
Now if a lower male wishes
to challenge for leadership,

296
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,630
he must do it with cunning
and patience,

297
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,174
-not direct defiance.
-What about the truth?

298
00:15:26,174 --> 00:15:27,634
I mean, Proctor did say that--

299
00:15:27,634 --> 00:15:30,178
This childish insistence
on the truth.

300
00:15:30,178 --> 00:15:31,930
You should be mastering
these conflicts

301
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,975
instead of continuing
to seek shelter in them

302
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:40,397
from the professional success
you might so easily attain.

303
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,816
You think that I could easily...

304
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:46,194
Ernestito,
are you coming over later?

305
00:15:46,194 --> 00:15:48,697
(smacking)

306
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,035
I'll see you Tuesday.

307
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,956
(music stopping)

308
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,003
Mr. Singer...

309
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:06,089
My love is not a shield.

310
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:09,050
It is a sword.

311
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,553
(piano music)

312
00:16:13,513 --> 00:16:16,016
(indistinct chatter)

313
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,994
Whoa there, Kemosabe.

314
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:40,332
Me no trust Yankee firewater
before me give speech, hm?

315
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,834
(clanking)

316
00:16:47,964 --> 00:16:50,467
(indistinct whispering)

317
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,852
These people are of
a different species.

318
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:04,189
They were mixing martinis
in the womb.

319
00:17:05,982 --> 00:17:08,360
Hey, you want me to go first?

320
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,279
Um, yeah, would you?

321
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:13,823
I don't know
what's gotten into me.

322
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,457
(music continuing)

323
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,585
(door closing)

324
00:17:25,585 --> 00:17:27,629
Not hungry, Mr. Singer?

325
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,756
Oh, I can't eat yet.

326
00:17:29,756 --> 00:17:31,758
It's Jake.

327
00:17:31,758 --> 00:17:34,803
Jake, would you rather be alone
to go over your speech?

328
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,973
Well, I'm sure you have guests
to attend to.

329
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,183
You're one of them.

330
00:17:40,183 --> 00:17:42,310
I'm sorry, I'm just feeling
a little bereft

331
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,229
of small talk right now.

332
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,523
So, what are you teaching
at school?

333
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:49,442
Um, we are up to the Romantics.

334
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:52,654
Wordsworth and Shelley,
not the pop group.

335
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:53,822
Well, "What I Like About You"

336
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,533
doesn't require
much explanation.

337
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,201
So, what about the poets?

338
00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:00,620
-Really?
-Really.

339
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,540
Um, they were obsessed
with nature,

340
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,251
uh, using it as a metaphor
for the inner life.

341
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:10,797
So, the "sanguine sunset,"
the "dark battling clouds."

342
00:18:10,797 --> 00:18:13,633
Nature, for them, was a mirror
of the inner life,

343
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:14,884
both light and dark.

344
00:18:14,884 --> 00:18:18,597
And now is your chance
to escape.

345
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,600
I was actually enjoying it,
but maybe you're the one

346
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,101
who wants to escape.

347
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:25,103
(sighing)

348
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,064
Are you nervous or something?

349
00:18:28,064 --> 00:18:29,357
I guess.

350
00:18:29,357 --> 00:18:31,818
(laughing)

351
00:18:31,818 --> 00:18:33,486
What? What's wrong?

352
00:18:33,486 --> 00:18:36,364
My insane Argentinean analyst
doesn't want me to use words

353
00:18:36,364 --> 00:18:38,617
like "I guess" or to guess.

354
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,369
And I probably shouldn't be
invoking him either.

355
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:43,455
Sounds stern, your analyst.

356
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:47,250
-Are there other kinds?
-I guess.

357
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,294
I thought he was
supposed to make you feel

358
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,588
more comfortable
in your own skin, no?

359
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:54,799
Mm, no, he's more
the exfoliating type.

360
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,427
(chuckling)

361
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,721
I thought teachers were good
at public speaking.

362
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:03,683
Well, in a classroom,
no problem, but...

363
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,520
I mean, in there,

364
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,399
the maid's room is bigger
than my apartment.

365
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:13,943
Um, I'm sorry, that was rude.

366
00:19:13,943 --> 00:19:15,987
A little.

367
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:17,447
Look, Mrs. Marshall,
can we just forget about--

368
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,158
Allegra.

369
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:22,535
And I was actually enjoying it.

370
00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:24,621
Honesty is good.

371
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:27,666
But, um, I just--I wish I could

372
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,959
make you feel more comfortable.

373
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:31,336
Uh, actually, you have.

374
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,462
I can't imagine I could be

375
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:35,215
more of an asshole today, so...

376
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,008
Still early.

377
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:39,469
I'll see you inside.

378
00:19:46,142 --> 00:19:48,228
(clicking)

379
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,521
Just a minute.

380
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,440
(toilet gurgling)

381
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,485
Quite so, Mr. Singer.

382
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,195
Take a minute.

383
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:59,531
(enigmatic music)

384
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,450
Could you not see
how you push away this woman

385
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,786
for daring to be interested
in you?

386
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:08,373
Interested? No, fake interest
is more like it, Doc.

387
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,583
New York is full of people
with lousy boundaries.

388
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:14,129
But why you not listen to her
and speak with more honesty?

389
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,714
Because that's not
what they want.

390
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,257
They want the rah, rah, rah,

391
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,967
buff-up the hood ornament
speech.

392
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,385
If it's so boring
and so stupid,

393
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,346
why you cry in fear
beforehand?

394
00:20:23,346 --> 00:20:24,973
Who's crying?

395
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,975
Cramps, diarrhea.

396
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:30,061
You're grown-up, so you do it
through your asshole.

397
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,649
-Everything all right?
-Yeah.

398
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:36,651
Fine.

399
00:20:36,651 --> 00:20:40,196
Hey, tell me,
which one is her husband?

400
00:20:40,196 --> 00:20:42,407
You don't know? He's dead.

401
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,533
What happened?
Was he in an accident?

402
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:44,701
He couldn't have been that old.

403
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,995
Forty-two. Massive coronary.

404
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,830
She inherited his seat
on the board

405
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,083
and I guess
she wants to keep it.

406
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,586
(indistinct chatter)

407
00:20:57,922 --> 00:20:59,299
...to afford
the kind of diversity

408
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:03,762
in our student body
in keeping with our mission

409
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,388
and make our school a mirror

410
00:21:05,388 --> 00:21:08,850
of the values we want
in our own society.

411
00:21:16,524 --> 00:21:18,234
(sighing)

412
00:21:18,234 --> 00:21:20,361
Um...

413
00:21:20,361 --> 00:21:24,949
To be honest, I never thought
that I would be a teacher

414
00:21:24,949 --> 00:21:26,868
at a place like Coventry.

415
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:29,662
When I was young, my mom died,

416
00:21:29,662 --> 00:21:32,207
and I had a lot of bumpy years,

417
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:35,668
but I was lucky enough to have
some really great teachers,

418
00:21:35,668 --> 00:21:39,631
and school became my ballast.

419
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,759
So, when I became a teacher,
I realized

420
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,719
that if we're gonna change
this world, we have to do it

421
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:47,597
from the bottom
and from the top.

422
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:50,683
It's like
when John F. Kennedy said,

423
00:21:50,683 --> 00:21:56,481
"With great privilege
comes great responsibility."

424
00:21:59,108 --> 00:22:01,444
Great young people
don't just happen.

425
00:22:01,444 --> 00:22:04,948
They come from an environment
where they've...

426
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,951
been challenged and nurtured.

427
00:22:09,744 --> 00:22:12,247
(applause)

428
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,500
-Great job.
-Thanks.

429
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,044
Really, great job.

430
00:22:18,044 --> 00:22:20,046
Thank you.

431
00:22:20,046 --> 00:22:22,924
The score remains exactly
97 to 98.

432
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:26,094
No more cookies, Alex.

433
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,762
Why do they foul so much?

434
00:22:27,762 --> 00:22:29,681
Mm, that's a good question.

435
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,182
Either he thought
they could get way with it

436
00:22:31,182 --> 00:22:32,267
or he didn't know he did it.

437
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,435
Either way, it's still part
of the game.

438
00:22:34,435 --> 00:22:37,522
(indistinct chatter)

439
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,815
I'm glad your appetite
has returned.

440
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,483
Oh, everything is delicious.

441
00:22:40,483 --> 00:22:43,152
Um, listen,
I want to apologize.

442
00:22:43,152 --> 00:22:45,780
I had no idea
about your husband.

443
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,075
I thought you were
the one person brave enough

444
00:22:49,075 --> 00:22:51,536
to talk to me
about something else.

445
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,454
-I'll be happy to do that.
-Hey, Jake,

446
00:22:53,454 --> 00:22:56,374
why was that a foul?

447
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:58,626
Uh, some of the guests
have questions for you,

448
00:22:58,626 --> 00:23:02,255
but apparently so does Alex.

449
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,173
Ask.

450
00:23:04,173 --> 00:23:06,926
I had no idea she was a widow.

451
00:23:06,926 --> 00:23:08,344
And you found it
easier to flirt

452
00:23:08,344 --> 00:23:09,888
when you thought
she was married?

453
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,556
This is backward, Mr. Singer.

454
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,807
I gave them what they wanted.

455
00:23:12,807 --> 00:23:14,434
Look, the whole thing,
it's just a bunch--

456
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:17,478
Bullshit. Mm.

457
00:23:17,478 --> 00:23:19,564
Are you not tired
of preventing yourself

458
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,400
from a genuine involvement

459
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,652
in your feelings and your life?

460
00:23:26,362 --> 00:23:28,656
Yes.

461
00:23:28,656 --> 00:23:29,949
Hm.

462
00:23:29,949 --> 00:23:31,659
Simple honesty.

463
00:23:33,077 --> 00:23:37,040
Before you evade
your feelings again,

464
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,835
tell me, will you pursue
the healthy sexual interest

465
00:23:40,835 --> 00:23:42,962
between you and this dowager?

466
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:47,592
That is an antiquated term.

467
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,677
Or have you
already lost interest

468
00:23:49,677 --> 00:23:53,306
because, in fact,
she's available?

469
00:23:56,517 --> 00:23:57,852
I don't understand.

470
00:23:57,852 --> 00:24:00,021
My SAT scores are, like...

471
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:03,358
Are not the same thing
as doing well in English class.

472
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,777
But I spent the whole summer
doing practice exams.

473
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:06,945
I mean, that should be enough--

474
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,614
Tell me something,
did you read just one book

475
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,783
during that time just for fun?

476
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,827
My dad thinks reading fiction
is a waste of time.

477
00:24:14,827 --> 00:24:16,829
Now he's on my back like crazy.

478
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:19,582
Do me a favor,
just read the Chekhov play.

479
00:24:19,582 --> 00:24:20,625
I don't care if you hate it.

480
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,335
-Just read it.
-Yes, Mrs. Marshall.

481
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,837
No, no, no, he's probably
just got the same bug as you

482
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:26,589
and the babysitter.

483
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,176
Oh, hang on.

484
00:24:30,176 --> 00:24:32,553
No, no, I would love
to take him home myself,

485
00:24:32,553 --> 00:24:35,056
but, you know, with four people
here already sick,

486
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:38,267
-I better not leave.
-I've got a free period.

487
00:24:38,267 --> 00:24:39,727
I can take him home,
I know Mrs. Marshall.

488
00:24:39,727 --> 00:24:42,230
-It'll be okay.
-Hang on, Mrs. Marshall.

489
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,398
We're trying to get
this poor boy home,

490
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,483
if you don't mind, Mr. Singer.

491
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,866
-I'm sick.
-I know,

492
00:24:53,866 --> 00:24:56,536
but you're gonna get better.

493
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:59,539
My dad was sick and he died.

494
00:25:01,165 --> 00:25:05,294
That was very sad
but also very rare.

495
00:25:05,294 --> 00:25:07,422
My sister doesn't even realize.

496
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,507
She's too little.

497
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:16,973
She thinks my mom is gonna be
one of those single mothers.

498
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:20,560
Well, when your sister
gets older,

499
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,812
you can tell her
about her dad.

500
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,316
Hi, sweetie.

501
00:25:27,316 --> 00:25:28,484
Mm, go lie down.

502
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:30,319
I'll be right inside, okay?

503
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:32,113
Oh, thank you so much,
Mr. Singer.

504
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,281
Oh, no, it was no problem.

505
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:35,783
He's a great kid,
and it's Jake, remember?

506
00:25:35,783 --> 00:25:37,618
Of course. Jake, let me,

507
00:25:37,618 --> 00:25:38,911
uh, give you some money
for the taxi.

508
00:25:38,911 --> 00:25:41,998
-No, please, please, please.
-I insist. Thank you.

509
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,416
Um, well, at least
let me go get you

510
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,709
some wonton soup or something.

511
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,003
-It always works for me.
-Oh, that's so sweet,

512
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:50,590
but, um, we're already
making some, we're fine.

513
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,801
Oh, right,
you're probably covered.

514
00:25:53,801 --> 00:25:55,470
Well, I wish I could
get you something,

515
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,723
but I know that sounds silly.

516
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,726
Why is that silly?

517
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:06,397
Well, what could I get
that you don't already have?

518
00:26:08,941 --> 00:26:11,652
Try using your imagination.

519
00:26:11,652 --> 00:26:13,488
Okay, I can do that.

520
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:17,325
Okay, thank you
for bringing my boy home.

521
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,952
Bye.

522
00:26:19,952 --> 00:26:22,705
"Oh, you are so charming,
Mr. Singer.

523
00:26:22,705 --> 00:26:24,707
Why do you not teach
in charm school?"

524
00:26:24,707 --> 00:26:26,542
(music starting)

525
00:26:26,542 --> 00:26:29,045
(unintelligible muttering)

526
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,221
(leaves rustling)

527
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,516
Mr. Singer?

528
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,896
-Mr. Singer!
-Sorry.

529
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:49,732
It's just such a pretty day.

530
00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:53,903
Well, let us follow
your attention, then,

531
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,947
go outside for a walk.

532
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,574
Serious? The two of us?
Are you joking?

533
00:26:58,574 --> 00:27:00,952
There are no jokes in here,
Mr. Singer.

534
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,921
I thought this whole process
was supposed to be

535
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,256
more sympathetic.

536
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,216
You want somebody
to be kind to you?

537
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,468
Is that what you want?

538
00:27:17,468 --> 00:27:20,388
But that's not my function.

539
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,223
What I can do,
if you permit it,

540
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:25,726
is to help you obtain
this intimacy from others.

541
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,564
But you must give it more time.

542
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:34,485
We're doing the hard work
of clearing away all the muck

543
00:27:34,485 --> 00:27:38,531
of denial, repression,
and fear.

544
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:42,702
I heard medication
works for some people.

545
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,580
In your case, it would be
a rank convenience.

546
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,748
(clearing throat)

547
00:27:47,748 --> 00:27:53,296
No, if only you can face
your issues directly,

548
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:57,758
you will be capable
of love, wisdom...

549
00:27:57,758 --> 00:28:03,222
satisfaction of work,
wealth, and sex

550
00:28:03,222 --> 00:28:06,225
of the most hot
and juicy variety.

551
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,272
Now I'm sorry, but that is
the end of the session.

552
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:14,275
I must return, but please,

553
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,819
don't stop the treatment.

554
00:28:27,246 --> 00:28:29,749
(rustling)

555
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:41,636
(distant car engine whirring)

556
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:44,138
(mellow jazz music)

557
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,984
(glasses clinking)

558
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,698
(indistinct remarks)

559
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:32,144
Well, look who
the cat dragged in.

560
00:29:32,144 --> 00:29:35,106
Some of you may know
the infamous Jake Singer.

561
00:29:36,565 --> 00:29:38,025
-Hi.
-Congratulations.

562
00:29:38,025 --> 00:29:39,652
Thank you.

563
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,070
Andre, this is Jake.

564
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,530
-Jake, Andre.
-How you doing?

565
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,782
So you see, Andre,
now you have two of Julia's exes

566
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:46,367
here tonight
to wish you the best.

567
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,828
Does that speak well
of Julia or what?

568
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,538
Speaks well of her as an ex.

569
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,665
(chuckling)

570
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:55,042
On that note, here is to Julia,

571
00:29:55,042 --> 00:29:58,921
and her final beau
and never-to-be ex, Andre:

572
00:29:58,921 --> 00:30:01,757
A long and happy life together.

573
00:30:01,757 --> 00:30:03,092
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

574
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,635
Salut.

575
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:07,263
Jake, I've heard
so much about you.

576
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:10,516
Well, I hope
at least some of it was good.

577
00:30:10,516 --> 00:30:12,643
Oh, it's all good.

578
00:30:12,643 --> 00:30:14,895
It's part of who Julia is,

579
00:30:14,895 --> 00:30:17,898
and I love all of her.

580
00:30:17,898 --> 00:30:20,860
Aw, thank you.

581
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,111
Your turn.

582
00:30:24,196 --> 00:30:26,866
Um.

583
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:30,202
Well, in case
some of you don't know

584
00:30:30,202 --> 00:30:32,872
about Julia's other interests,

585
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:36,083
um, I found this photo

586
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:37,877
a few days ago.

587
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:39,754
You can pass it around.

588
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:42,089
Always the teacher.

589
00:30:42,089 --> 00:30:45,634
That was taken the year
that we were teaching in Brazil,

590
00:30:45,634 --> 00:30:47,762
and the kids in the background
showed a newfound interest

591
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:51,015
in literacy when Julia
was teaching the class.

592
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,641
And it was a great year for us,

593
00:30:52,641 --> 00:30:54,810
um, trying to figure out
where we fit in

594
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,395
and how we were gonna
change the world.

595
00:30:56,395 --> 00:31:00,691
And you know,
maybe we let our ideals

596
00:31:00,691 --> 00:31:03,611
run away with us, but I do know
that at the end of a year

597
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:06,238
at least 15 kids learned
to think for themselves

598
00:31:06,238 --> 00:31:09,033
and I learned that
I could make a difference,

599
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,202
and none of that
would've happened

600
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,621
if not for Julia.

601
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,790
So I'm forever in her debt.

602
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,458
And, um,

603
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:20,920
I also hope that
that year means as much to her

604
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,671
as it does to me.

605
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,634
Um, and so cheers

606
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:29,053
to your new life together.

607
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,304
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

608
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,889
-Here, here.
-Thank you.

609
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:35,309
(glasses clinking)

610
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:37,686
(crowd roaring)

611
00:31:37,686 --> 00:31:39,063
25 seconds left.

612
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,564
Hold it.

613
00:31:40,564 --> 00:31:43,776
Hold the ball
before you take the shot!

614
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,194
Run it down, Walter,
you hear me?

615
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,946
I want you to run it down!

616
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:50,032
(applauding and cheering)

617
00:31:50,032 --> 00:31:53,077
(whistling)

618
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,746
No!

619
00:31:55,746 --> 00:31:58,040
All right, get back, get back!

620
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,959
(whistling)

621
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,961
(buzzing)

622
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,463
(cheering and applauding)

623
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:09,510
(whistling)

624
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,095
What was that, huh?

625
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,722
Can't listen?

626
00:32:13,722 --> 00:32:15,975
What is that Walter, huh?

627
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,685
What did I tell you?

628
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,186
You hold the ball
with 10 seconds left,

629
00:32:19,186 --> 00:32:20,604
they don't get it back.

630
00:32:20,604 --> 00:32:22,356
You gotta use your head
once in a while,

631
00:32:22,356 --> 00:32:24,275
-use your fucking head.
-Coach, he had the open shot.

632
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,943
-Oh yeah?
-22 points, 9 assists.

633
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:28,279
Lay off him.

634
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,780
(clanking)

635
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,407
It's called
following orders, Cooper,

636
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:32,867
being part of a team.

637
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,452
You wanna showboat,

638
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,120
go on back to the playground
where we found you.

639
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,289
-Just ignore him, Walter.
-Who asked you, Singer?

640
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,541
I'm the coach here,
you skinny fuck.

641
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,209
Walter!

642
00:32:42,209 --> 00:32:45,463
(grunting and groaning)

643
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,299
-Oh shit, Mr. Singer.
-Oh Christ.

644
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,885
(panting)

645
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,762
Somebody call a doctor,
call an ambulance!

646
00:32:53,762 --> 00:32:55,764
My father's a doctor.

647
00:32:57,224 --> 00:33:00,394
No, I--I think
I'm gonna be fine.

648
00:33:00,394 --> 00:33:02,062
(doorbell buzzing)

649
00:33:02,062 --> 00:33:03,522
Hold on a second.

650
00:33:03,522 --> 00:33:06,108
(pensive music)

651
00:33:06,108 --> 00:33:08,694
Uh, Jeff, I gotta call you back.

652
00:33:08,694 --> 00:33:10,613
(unlatching)

653
00:33:12,114 --> 00:33:15,284
-Hi.
-Hi.

654
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,244
Uh, I should've called,

655
00:33:17,244 --> 00:33:20,664
but uh, the doorman says
just to come up.

656
00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:22,583
The door--oh, that's Tim.

657
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:25,503
He's just the superintendent.

658
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,962
How--how's Alex?

659
00:33:26,962 --> 00:33:28,756
Oh, he's fine, thanks.

660
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,257
What about you?

661
00:33:30,257 --> 00:33:31,717
I can't believe
you put your head in the way

662
00:33:31,717 --> 00:33:33,677
of that stupid coach.

663
00:33:33,677 --> 00:33:37,139
Yeah, well, at least
it's good for something.

664
00:33:37,139 --> 00:33:40,809
Uh, do--do you wanna come in?

665
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:42,853
Yeah, thank you.

666
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:49,944
(latching)

667
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,987
Well, my maid would be
very happy here.

668
00:33:51,987 --> 00:33:53,906
(chuckling)

669
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:57,284
Uh, I--I can offer you
some dry cereal,

670
00:33:57,284 --> 00:34:00,788
ginger ale, um, ibuprofen.

671
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,581
-Oh, no, um--
-Oh, here, here.

672
00:34:02,581 --> 00:34:04,333
Thank you, I'm fine.

673
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,835
(rustling)

674
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:11,924
So I, uh--I brought you
some soup and a book.

675
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,676
Uh, what kind of soup?

676
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:16,470
-Oh, I can't tell you exactly.
-Why not?

677
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:19,014
Wow, that's a lot of garlic.

678
00:34:20,891 --> 00:34:22,560
Yeah, and a few
mystery ingredients

679
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,019
I can't divulge,

680
00:34:24,019 --> 00:34:26,063
let alone pronounce.

681
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:27,982
Uh, who has the secret?

682
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:30,943
Oh, this, um, lovely woman
in Guatemala.

683
00:34:32,736 --> 00:34:37,074
That seems awfully far
to go for a cooking class.

684
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:40,536
Well, I went down there, um,
as a hurricane relief worker,

685
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:43,539
and, uh, drank some bad water,
got really sick,

686
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,416
so she fed me this soup.

687
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,918
And then I came up with the idea
to put out a book of local cures

688
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,420
to raise money.

689
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,256
I was gonna call it
Recipes of Necessity.

690
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,008
Mm.

691
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,634
That's a good idea.

692
00:34:55,634 --> 00:34:57,928
Uh, yeah.

693
00:34:57,928 --> 00:35:00,180
Well, then I got married.

694
00:35:02,349 --> 00:35:03,767
(clanking)

695
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:06,228
Where'd you get this?

696
00:35:06,228 --> 00:35:07,730
Oh, I was in the office
at school

697
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,274
and I saw your inbox, so, um,

698
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,276
I borrowed it.

699
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,236
I loaned it to Walter,
I wonder if he read it.

700
00:35:14,236 --> 00:35:16,071
(sloshing)

701
00:35:16,071 --> 00:35:18,073
How'd you like it?

702
00:35:18,073 --> 00:35:20,784
It's a long way
from the Romantic poets,

703
00:35:20,784 --> 00:35:23,746
but, uh, I liked it.

704
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:26,498
I mean, he redrew
the landscape, right?

705
00:35:26,498 --> 00:35:28,876
Placed equal emphasis
on what's not said.

706
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:30,753
(distant train whistling)

707
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,838
Yeah, that's right.

708
00:35:32,838 --> 00:35:34,715
It was written in the margin.

709
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:37,217
(chuckling)

710
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:42,431
(shuffling)

711
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,016
Can I help you?

712
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:47,394
Yeah, why don't you
cut the mushrooms?

713
00:35:47,394 --> 00:35:49,897
(clattering)

714
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,985
(chopping)

715
00:35:58,822 --> 00:36:01,575
So,

716
00:36:01,575 --> 00:36:03,535
what'd you think of it?

717
00:36:03,535 --> 00:36:07,164
Um, I liked his, uh--

718
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:09,416
His style.

719
00:36:09,416 --> 00:36:11,418
It was so direct,

720
00:36:11,418 --> 00:36:13,045
emotionally.

721
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:15,631
Oh, yeah, uh,

722
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,341
he's ruthless.

723
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,843
(contemplative music)

724
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,807
-Sorry.
-Just not quite as small.

725
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:34,900
Will you please kiss me, please?

726
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:01,802
Which sexual positions
did you use?

727
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:04,471
Excuse me?

728
00:37:04,471 --> 00:37:07,141
Well, you did fuck, didn't you?

729
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:10,185
Yes, as a matter of fact.

730
00:37:10,185 --> 00:37:13,397
Well, did you,
as a matter of fact, enjoy it?

731
00:37:15,357 --> 00:37:18,527
Greatly, I quite enjoyed it.

732
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:20,237
-She have a climax?
-Oh, what is this,

733
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:23,615
-a locker room?
-Well, what is wrong with this?

734
00:37:23,615 --> 00:37:26,493
I teach high school,
I try not to linger in it.

735
00:37:26,493 --> 00:37:28,704
This is often the only chance
young men in this culture

736
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,290
have to discuss such matters,
however crudely.

737
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,916
I just don't see
why it's important.

738
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:34,543
Why would anything
that marks you

739
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:37,087
as a member of the human race
count as important?

740
00:37:37,087 --> 00:37:40,257
No, with your suffering,
you have evolved.

741
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:42,134
(clock ticking)

742
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:44,803
Perhaps you belong up there.

743
00:37:44,803 --> 00:37:46,388
Oh, I--I didn't mean that--

744
00:37:46,388 --> 00:37:51,226
No, then will you please
stop pretending

745
00:37:51,226 --> 00:37:53,103
that you are unfamiliar
with these terms?

746
00:37:53,103 --> 00:37:55,773
And I don't see
why I need to convince you

747
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,358
the importance
of your first sexual encounter

748
00:37:58,358 --> 00:38:01,320
in almost a year.

749
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,654
Thanks, Doc.

750
00:38:02,654 --> 00:38:05,157
(mellow music)

751
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,160
I should go.

752
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,871
Uh, yeah, I was afraid
you were gonna say that.

753
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:13,373
(chuckling)

754
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:19,671
Can--can we take it slow?

755
00:38:19,671 --> 00:38:22,841
I mean, if you'd like to go on.

756
00:38:24,718 --> 00:38:26,929
Uh, yeah.

757
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,890
Wait, what do you mean?

758
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,726
Just like to be careful
not to confuse the kids.

759
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,399
Not just the kids.

760
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:47,741
Were you happy
with your husband?

761
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,663
We had good times, yeah.

762
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,208
But we also struggled.

763
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,920
Both my kids are adopted.

764
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:05,968
Did he want kids
as much as you did?

765
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:09,012
A little less when he found out
he couldn't have his own.

766
00:39:09,012 --> 00:39:11,056
(distant car engine whirring)

767
00:39:11,056 --> 00:39:12,766
But he loved Alex.

768
00:39:12,766 --> 00:39:14,852
Yeah, he's a good kid.

769
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,688
Emily, though, oh wow,
she looks like trouble.

770
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:23,652
Hey, hey.

771
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,362
I'm kidding.

772
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,452
Emily's adoption isn't final.

773
00:39:34,496 --> 00:39:36,665
What do you mean?

774
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,876
Well, we're--

775
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,253
We're supposed to be
a two-parent family,

776
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:43,213
but, um,

777
00:39:43,213 --> 00:39:45,549
George passed away before--

778
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,634
The adoption agency doesn't know
your husband's dead?

779
00:39:47,634 --> 00:39:49,803
Oh, I--

780
00:39:49,803 --> 00:39:51,889
I know it's not smart.

781
00:39:54,057 --> 00:39:55,642
Well, how--how have you managed

782
00:39:55,642 --> 00:39:58,896
to keep them
from figuring it out?

783
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,315
Uh, before the state
grants me custody,

784
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:05,527
the agency's supposed to do
a final home check-up.

785
00:40:05,527 --> 00:40:08,322
I've been dodging them so far.

786
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:09,865
Wow.

787
00:40:12,075 --> 00:40:13,911
That seems risky.

788
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:17,247
I know.

789
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,959
Sometimes you just react.

790
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:28,342
I love Emily so much.

791
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,510
I couldn't bear to lose her.

792
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,185
I'm just not sure
I should've done it.

793
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:41,104
It--it was fun,
but she's obviously

794
00:40:41,104 --> 00:40:42,689
very vulnerable.

795
00:40:42,689 --> 00:40:45,484
You think you're protecting
an endangered bird,

796
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:49,404
when in fact
she's a rising phoenix,

797
00:40:49,404 --> 00:40:51,615
and you are under the dog.

798
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,618
I--I'm her dog,
is that what you're saying?

799
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,371
You began this liaison
by pointing out her wealth.

800
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:00,207
No, just my lack of it.

801
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,709
You refused to dine
with her and her guests,

802
00:41:02,709 --> 00:41:04,503
with her preferring
to eat with the--

803
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,922
-The maids in the kitchen.
-I don't divide the world

804
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:09,633
into maids and--

805
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:14,096
Well, that's very conscientious
of you, Mr. Singer.

806
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,514
I will alert the media.

807
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,015
Hey, fuck you!

808
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,477
You know, if it's so important
for me to finally get laid,

809
00:41:20,477 --> 00:41:23,271
why are you making me
feel weird about it?

810
00:41:23,271 --> 00:41:26,441
I mean, do--do you have a wife?

811
00:41:26,441 --> 00:41:28,235
Do you have a life?

812
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:32,155
Or am I just some sort of
pathetic, lousy excuse for one?

813
00:41:32,155 --> 00:41:33,865
Are you through?

814
00:41:33,865 --> 00:41:37,911
No, and get a goddamn
answering machine that works.

815
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:39,871
I think you could afford it.

816
00:41:39,871 --> 00:41:42,207
Next week is Valentine's Day.

817
00:41:42,207 --> 00:41:43,667
I'm not getting you a gift.

818
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,213
Last Valentine's Day card I made
was for my mother and she died.

819
00:41:50,298 --> 00:41:53,093
The lover in you
is badly malnourished.

820
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:57,305
And the self-pitying side
is overfed.

821
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,101
Why don't you
do something romantic?

822
00:42:02,644 --> 00:42:05,439
-Court the widow.
-What, now?

823
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,691
You think we should--?

824
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,860
Well, keep things light.

825
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,863
Enjoy yourself,
but don't get too entangled.

826
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,865
(clock ticking)

827
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,367
(breathing heavily)

828
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:19,870
(mellow jazz music)

829
00:42:21,371 --> 00:42:24,458
Are you thinking
of your parents, Mr. Singer?

830
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,044
-What?
-What was that?

831
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,336
-Someone come in here?
-No, no, no, no, no.

832
00:42:28,336 --> 00:42:29,921
Don't worry, the door's locked.

833
00:42:29,921 --> 00:42:31,298
It's probably the maid
or something.

834
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:33,091
Are you afraid
there must be punishment

835
00:42:33,091 --> 00:42:35,719
after this domestic sex?

836
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,471
Mom!

837
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,347
I'm home.

838
00:42:39,347 --> 00:42:41,725
Uh, sweetie, I'll be--
I'll be out in a second, okay?

839
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,685
Uh, Mommy just
got out of the shower.

840
00:42:43,685 --> 00:42:46,354
-Don't stop.
-He's right outside.

841
00:42:46,354 --> 00:42:48,690
-Shh.
-Oh.

842
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:51,193
(grunting and moaning)

843
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,446
(sighing)

844
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:55,739
Oh, come on.

845
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,574
It feels good
with you inside of me

846
00:42:57,574 --> 00:42:59,618
in the daytime,
can't I have that?

847
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,953
-Yeah, but--
-So don't punish me, Jake.

848
00:43:01,953 --> 00:43:03,914
Fuck me.

849
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,458
Alas, your sainted mother...

850
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,001
(moaning)

851
00:43:08,001 --> 00:43:09,461
...was also a sexual being.

852
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:12,380
Mom, can me and Jeffrey
have a Devil Dog?

853
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:16,051
Your parents
had to fuck and suck

854
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:17,552
to make you.

855
00:43:17,552 --> 00:43:19,221
Grandma says I have to ask you.

856
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,972
Grandma?

857
00:43:20,972 --> 00:43:22,390
Sh, sh.

858
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:23,934
My mother-in-law, it's okay.

859
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,394
(groaning)

860
00:43:26,394 --> 00:43:28,188
Oh, we can't--we can't do this,
we can't do this.

861
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:29,648
Oh, come on.

862
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,441
They chose their life,
Mr. Singer,

863
00:43:31,441 --> 00:43:33,527
and they lived it.

864
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:36,029
(breathing heavily)

865
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,534
Mom!

866
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:43,578
Uh, tell Grandma
you can have one Devil Dog!

867
00:43:43,578 --> 00:43:46,081
(moaning and grunting)

868
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,422
(breathing heavily)

869
00:43:57,759 --> 00:43:59,177
Come around the other side.

870
00:43:59,177 --> 00:44:01,805
It'll look like
you were in the office.

871
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,015
(thudding)

872
00:44:04,015 --> 00:44:05,934
Hey, Claire.

873
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:08,103
I thought you were taking them
to the children's museum.

874
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:12,357
I was, but the boys wanted
to stop home for a snack first,

875
00:44:12,357 --> 00:44:15,235
-and I--
-Thought you'd check up on me?

876
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,612
I needed the restroom anyway.

877
00:44:17,612 --> 00:44:19,030
Hi, guys.

878
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:21,032
-Hey, this is Jeffrey.
-Hi, Jeffrey.

879
00:44:21,032 --> 00:44:22,701
Hey, aren't you
a teacher at school?

880
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:26,037
I am, yeah, I am also
a very big fan of Devil Dogs.

881
00:44:26,037 --> 00:44:28,999
Hey, how--how'd he know?

882
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:32,836
Oh, Claire, uh,
do you remember Jake Singer?

883
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,797
I--I believe I heard you speak.

884
00:44:35,797 --> 00:44:38,049
-How are you?
-Very well, thank you.

885
00:44:38,049 --> 00:44:39,676
Uh, yourself?

886
00:44:39,676 --> 00:44:41,178
Good.

887
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:44,014
Uh, Jake seems to have
lost a--a fountain pen

888
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,557
at the fundraiser here.

889
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:48,518
Oh, how quaint.

890
00:44:48,518 --> 00:44:52,147
I mean, who cares
about a pen these days?

891
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:54,149
Well, actually
it was my father's.

892
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:57,027
And, uh,
did you find it upstairs?

893
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,156
No, unfortunately
I couldn't find it.

894
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:04,367
Oh, won't your father
be disappointed?

895
00:45:04,367 --> 00:45:06,870
Well, it's just one
of many disappointments.

896
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,873
Besides he didn't know
I stole it.

897
00:45:13,835 --> 00:45:15,629
Why don't you stay to dinner?

898
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:18,423
If you promise
not to steal anything.

899
00:45:18,423 --> 00:45:20,884
(chuckling awkwardly)

900
00:45:22,385 --> 00:45:25,889
Um, no, actually
I should be going.

901
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,975
Yeah, um, I'm gonna
walk him out the door.

902
00:45:28,975 --> 00:45:31,019
But it was very nice
to see you again.

903
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:33,521
(pleasant music)

904
00:45:35,857 --> 00:45:38,360
(car engine whirring)

905
00:45:40,528 --> 00:45:43,031
(clinking)

906
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,877
-Yeah, that's good.
-(inaudible chatting)

907
00:45:55,877 --> 00:45:58,880
Put it on--no, on me.

908
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,757
-All right, here, right?
-Want me to turn around?

909
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:02,592
No.

910
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,389
(indistinct remarks)

911
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:09,891
(ball thudding)

912
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,522
(indistinct remarks)

913
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:18,358
-Come on, give it to me.
-Oh, go, go, go, go, go.

914
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,402
(groaning)

915
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:22,279
It's okay, it's okay.

916
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,863
-Ah!
-All right.

917
00:46:23,863 --> 00:46:25,824
It's a break and go,
where do we go?

918
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,909
-Yes!
-Oh, yes!

919
00:46:27,909 --> 00:46:30,412
(baby crying)

920
00:46:47,887 --> 00:46:49,764
(indistinct muttering)

921
00:46:49,764 --> 00:46:52,100
(buzzing)

922
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,269
-Who is it?
-Oh, hi, it's Jake Singer.

923
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:55,520
Buzzer doesn't work.

924
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,272
I'll be right down.

925
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:11,369
Hi, I'm Jake Singer,
I'm Walter's teacher, I called.

926
00:47:11,369 --> 00:47:12,746
Actually, you know,
we've met before I think.

927
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,205
I remember.

928
00:47:14,205 --> 00:47:16,166
He's not here.

929
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,376
I'm not here to harass him
or anything.

930
00:47:18,376 --> 00:47:21,212
Maybe you didn't
harass him enough.

931
00:47:21,212 --> 00:47:24,132
Listen, I've got
his books for him here.

932
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:26,634
(clinking)

933
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,014
He's out looking for a job.

934
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,724
Is he doing okay?

935
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:34,934
Ah, he won't talk much.

936
00:47:36,936 --> 00:47:39,189
Is his old school
gonna take him back?

937
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,399
Next year.

938
00:47:41,399 --> 00:47:44,152
My son did a bad thing,
but he's not a bad kid.

939
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:47,197
No, I know, if--if there's
anything I could do to help.

940
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:50,033
You tried to help Walter
and that's great,

941
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:54,537
and I'm really sorry
about your head.

942
00:47:54,537 --> 00:47:57,832
But sometimes
you just have to let it go.

943
00:47:57,832 --> 00:47:59,584
It's not your business anymore.

944
00:48:01,711 --> 00:48:03,713
-Take care.
-Okay.

945
00:48:03,713 --> 00:48:06,216
(brakes screeching)

946
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,724
(phone ringing)

947
00:48:14,724 --> 00:48:17,227
(keys jingling)

948
00:48:19,687 --> 00:48:21,731
-Hello.
-Is this Jacob Singer?

949
00:48:21,731 --> 00:48:23,274
-Who's this?
-I'm calling from

950
00:48:23,274 --> 00:48:24,818
North Ridge Hospital.

951
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:27,028
Are you the son
of Dr. Arnold Singer?

952
00:48:27,028 --> 00:48:28,279
Yeah, why.

953
00:48:28,279 --> 00:48:30,782
(contemplative music)

954
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,037
Seatbelt.

955
00:48:39,999 --> 00:48:42,502
(cars whooshing)

956
00:48:45,755 --> 00:48:48,258
(indistinct intercom remarks)

957
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:52,053
Dad?

958
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:57,100
Dad, it's Jake.

959
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,685
Can you hear me?

960
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,189
Jacob.

961
00:49:03,189 --> 00:49:05,358
Why you here?

962
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:06,693
You went into shock, Dad,

963
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:09,112
but they say
you're gonna be okay.

964
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,030
Huh.

965
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:12,949
Routine.

966
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:15,368
Why didn't you let them
test the dye?

967
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:19,497
They're supposed to test the dye
for allergies, Dad.

968
00:49:19,497 --> 00:49:21,082
You could've died.

969
00:49:25,336 --> 00:49:27,922
Uh-huh.

970
00:49:27,922 --> 00:49:30,383
Okay, you rest, Dad.

971
00:49:32,343 --> 00:49:34,220
I'll be here.

972
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:47,817
(grunting)

973
00:49:47,817 --> 00:49:49,402
(car door thudding)

974
00:49:49,402 --> 00:49:51,237
-You all right?
-Yeah.

975
00:49:51,237 --> 00:49:54,032
(exhaling heavily)

976
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:56,534
(unlatching)

977
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,413
Do you want me
to come in with you?

978
00:50:00,413 --> 00:50:02,165
It's a small room.

979
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,709
(latching)

980
00:50:06,669 --> 00:50:09,172
(thudding)

981
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,844
(clacking)

982
00:50:14,844 --> 00:50:16,596
I'm all right now, Jake,
you don't--

983
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:18,097
You don't need
to miss more work.

984
00:50:18,097 --> 00:50:19,557
(birds chirping)

985
00:50:19,557 --> 00:50:21,351
Ah, I'll stay
through the weekend.

986
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,397
(clacking)

987
00:50:26,397 --> 00:50:28,191
What about this woman
you're seeing?

988
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:32,445
She'll understand?

989
00:50:32,445 --> 00:50:34,739
Mhm.

990
00:50:34,739 --> 00:50:37,659
What'd her husband die of?

991
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:40,286
Coronary thrombosis.

992
00:50:40,286 --> 00:50:43,748
Well, it's mercifully quick
at least.

993
00:50:43,748 --> 00:50:45,542
Sometimes.

994
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,170
At least it's--

995
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:52,674
It's not thought to be genetic.

996
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:55,927
Actually,
both her kids are adopted.

997
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:57,554
Oh?

998
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:01,558
Have you considered this factor?

999
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,394
(birds chirping)

1000
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,354
-The point is that you--
-The point is, Dad,

1001
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:08,982
you would prefer
biological grandkids.

1002
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:10,942
Yes, I would, I would.

1003
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:15,738
-Something of your mother.
-Well,

1004
00:51:15,738 --> 00:51:19,659
I would, too,
and maybe that's still possible.

1005
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:21,953
(breathing heavily)

1006
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:24,706
But for now,

1007
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:26,916
I am something of my mother.

1008
00:51:37,802 --> 00:51:39,262
I'm not exactly
fit to entertain.

1009
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,597
She's not gonna
be in your way, Dad.

1010
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,098
...those kids
running around here,

1011
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:43,725
that's one thing.

1012
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:46,019
-You want some creamed spinach?
-I hate creamed spinach.

1013
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:47,729
I told you to get
some broccoli or something.

1014
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:50,189
-This is all they had, Dad.
-This will kill ya.

1015
00:51:51,899 --> 00:51:54,402
(sighing)

1016
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:56,904
(chewing)

1017
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:01,743
Listen, um,

1018
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:04,621
I may propose to Allegra,

1019
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,748
and if I do,

1020
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:08,750
I'd like to use Mom's ring.

1021
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,252
(crickets chirping)

1022
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:15,965
You gave it to--

1023
00:52:15,965 --> 00:52:18,176
(breathing heavily)

1024
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:19,969
What's her name?

1025
00:52:19,969 --> 00:52:21,429
-Julia.
-Yeah.

1026
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:23,723
-Mhm.
-Lovely girl.

1027
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,475
She gave it back.

1028
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,268
I know.

1029
00:52:27,268 --> 00:52:29,228
Um, that was a mistake
and I wasn't ready,

1030
00:52:29,228 --> 00:52:33,274
but I am now, Dad, and even if
Allegra doesn't accept it--

1031
00:52:36,235 --> 00:52:38,696
Yeah, well,
why don't you find out first?

1032
00:52:38,696 --> 00:52:40,657
It might save me the trouble.

1033
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,159
(breathing heavily)

1034
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:47,413
All right, I'll look for it,
I'll look for it.

1035
00:52:47,413 --> 00:52:49,832
Thank you.

1036
00:52:49,832 --> 00:52:51,584
I've gotta look for it.

1037
00:52:51,584 --> 00:52:53,461
Thanks.

1038
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,963
(bell dinging)

1039
00:52:55,963 --> 00:52:58,466
(pleasant music)

1040
00:53:14,315 --> 00:53:15,900
Dad.

1041
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,529
This is Allegra,
Alex, and Emily.

1042
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,572
Hi, so sorry
to barge in on you like this.

1043
00:53:21,572 --> 00:53:24,117
Oh, no, no, no,
please, please, come in.

1044
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,618
-Alex?
-Yep.

1045
00:53:25,618 --> 00:53:27,036
Hi.

1046
00:53:27,036 --> 00:53:28,496
Uh, I bet Alex would love to see

1047
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:29,872
the model of the heart
that you've got.

1048
00:53:29,872 --> 00:53:32,375
-Ah, I know.
-Here, come on.

1049
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,001
Sit over here.

1050
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:38,089
This here is a pump.

1051
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:42,385
Sends the blood
all through the body.

1052
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,387
Take that thing off there
with that pin.

1053
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:45,847
Look inside.

1054
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:48,349
(clattering)

1055
00:53:50,601 --> 00:53:53,104
(clacking)

1056
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:57,066
Where's the embolism?

1057
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:01,404
You know what that is?

1058
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:04,240
Heard a doctor say it
about my dad.

1059
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,118
Oh.

1060
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:10,788
Oh, it's kind of a hard thing
for a kid to know about.

1061
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,417
Could it happen to me?

1062
00:54:24,218 --> 00:54:25,928
No.

1063
00:54:28,055 --> 00:54:30,224
I don't think
you have to worry about it.

1064
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:37,148
Are you worried about it?

1065
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:39,442
Guess not.

1066
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,027
Good.

1067
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:46,115
-Can I go outside now?
-Sure.

1068
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,122
(breathing deeply)

1069
00:54:54,957 --> 00:54:58,795
I hope it was all right,
showing him this.

1070
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,047
He really seemed
to want to know.

1071
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:03,090
I think it, um--
it really helps him

1072
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:04,926
to hear it from someone
who's experienced

1073
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:06,469
that kind of loss.

1074
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:13,267
You must be a--a good teacher.

1075
00:55:13,267 --> 00:55:15,144
Jake must get it from somewhere.

1076
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:19,941
Wanted to teach him
at one time myself,

1077
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:21,359
to be a surgeon.

1078
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,277
(birds chirping)

1079
00:55:23,277 --> 00:55:24,987
Wasn't meant to be.

1080
00:55:27,156 --> 00:55:29,909
Dr. Singer,
if ever an English teacher

1081
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:32,745
was like a surgeon
in spirit, it's Jake.

1082
00:55:32,745 --> 00:55:34,372
That's very nice of you to say.

1083
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:37,375
Makes absolutely no sense.

1084
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:41,254
Well, uh,
it was worth a try, right?

1085
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:43,422
I guess.

1086
00:55:43,422 --> 00:55:44,882
Tell me something.

1087
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:48,427
(grunting)

1088
00:55:48,427 --> 00:55:50,096
What do you want from Jake?

1089
00:55:56,894 --> 00:55:58,521
Wow.

1090
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:01,107
You're very direct.

1091
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:03,442
Well, he's head over heels.

1092
00:56:03,442 --> 00:56:06,112
I can see why.

1093
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:09,407
But you've had--well, you have
pretty much a life and kids,

1094
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:11,200
and I was wondering.

1095
00:56:13,494 --> 00:56:16,622
I know he would like
to have a child of his own.

1096
00:56:16,622 --> 00:56:18,541
(clock ticking)

1097
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,251
Is that an option with you?

1098
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:24,547
Um.

1099
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,048
I——

1100
00:56:26,048 --> 00:56:28,342
Aren't you
jumping the gun a bit?

1101
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:32,972
Can we just give it some time
and see what happens?

1102
00:56:35,766 --> 00:56:38,060
Sure.

1103
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:39,645
Take care, Alex.

1104
00:56:39,645 --> 00:56:41,188
Take care of yourself,
good to meet ya.

1105
00:56:41,188 --> 00:56:42,565
-Bye.
-Bye.

1106
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,066
- I hope you feel better.
-Thanks.

1107
00:56:44,066 --> 00:56:45,735
(thudding)

1108
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,820
(whimsical music)

1109
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:50,448
-Bye, Dad, thanks.
-Son, thank you.

1110
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:52,116
-Mhm.
-She's really something.

1111
00:56:52,116 --> 00:56:54,410
- I know.
-Complicated business.

1112
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:56,454
-You know what you're doing?
-Mhm.

1113
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:58,497
Can we talk about this later?

1114
00:56:58,497 --> 00:57:00,333
-Sure.
-If you could keep an open mind,

1115
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:02,668
-it would mean a lot to me, Dad.
-I'll try.

1116
00:57:02,668 --> 00:57:04,128
Right.

1117
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:07,840
Drive safely.

1118
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,217
(engine turning over)

1119
00:57:10,217 --> 00:57:12,720
(engine whirring)

1120
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:27,818
(door thudding)

1121
00:57:30,571 --> 00:57:32,323
Mr. Singer.

1122
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:38,621
(water trickling)

1123
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:41,040
What are you doing?

1124
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,626
Watering your plant.

1125
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,544
I see.

1126
00:57:49,423 --> 00:57:52,176
(car engines whirring)

1127
00:57:52,176 --> 00:57:54,804
Mr. Singer,
where were you this morning?

1128
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,389
-What do you mean?
-They called your name

1129
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:59,308
in assembly for that
London thing next semester.

1130
00:57:59,308 --> 00:58:00,893
-Really?
-Yeah, it was funny.

1131
00:58:00,893 --> 00:58:02,144
Proctor looked around
and when you weren't there

1132
00:58:02,144 --> 00:58:03,437
he said you were off devising

1133
00:58:03,437 --> 00:58:05,398
the hardest
qualifying test ever.

1134
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:07,566
Oh, my God, Proctor tried
to make a joke, about me?

1135
00:58:07,566 --> 00:58:09,276
Yeah, I guess so, why?

1136
00:58:09,276 --> 00:58:11,570
Uh, it could be the end
of the world as we know it.

1137
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:13,489
Whatever,
see you later, Mr. Singer.

1138
00:58:13,489 --> 00:58:14,615
Bye, guys.

1139
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:19,078
Claire's away, temp maid today.

1140
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,830
Could you bring Alex home?

1141
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,790
Yes.

1142
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:23,916
Good news.

1143
00:58:23,916 --> 00:58:25,584
(typing)

1144
00:58:25,584 --> 00:58:26,836
How about dinner?

1145
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:28,295
(mellow music)

1146
00:58:28,295 --> 00:58:29,422
(computer notification)

1147
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:32,008
Okay. Need to go downtown
to the adoption agency at four.

1148
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,884
Should be back by six.

1149
00:58:33,884 --> 00:58:37,138
(typing)

1150
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:40,016
Mom said your mom died
when you were my age.

1151
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:42,059
Yeah, she did.

1152
00:58:42,059 --> 00:58:43,519
Did you miss her a lot?

1153
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:45,771
I still do.

1154
00:58:45,771 --> 00:58:47,690
At least you have your dad.

1155
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:51,027
He let me pick up one
of those knives doctors use,

1156
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,778
what do you call them?

1157
00:58:52,778 --> 00:58:54,572
Uh, scalpels.

1158
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:57,033
Yeah, that's right: scalpels.

1159
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,409
Your dad was cool.

1160
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:00,453
(Jake chuckles)

1161
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:03,789
Well, I'm glad you like him.

1162
00:59:03,789 --> 00:59:05,624
Did you have any fights
with him?

1163
00:59:05,624 --> 00:59:08,335
Uh, yeah, we, uh,
we had some big arguments.

1164
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:12,339
Are you gonna marry my mom?

1165
00:59:13,924 --> 00:59:14,842
Why?

1166
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:16,844
Do you want me to?

1167
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:17,678
I don't know.

1168
00:59:17,678 --> 00:59:20,222
It would be kinda weird.

1169
00:59:20,222 --> 00:59:21,724
Can I think about it?

1170
00:59:23,225 --> 00:59:26,395
Hi. Good afternoon.

1171
00:59:26,395 --> 00:59:29,857
Mrs. Callucci is waiting
for you and Mrs. Marshall

1172
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:31,275
in the living room.

1173
00:59:31,275 --> 00:59:33,319
-Mrs. Callucci?
-Mm-hm.

1174
00:59:35,946 --> 00:59:38,908
Um, uh...okay.

1175
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,869
Listen, can you do me a favor

1176
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:42,995
and just put on some coffee?

1177
00:59:42,995 --> 00:59:43,829
Oh, sure.

1178
00:59:43,829 --> 00:59:45,206
Here, hold the baby.

1179
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:46,332
Okay.

1180
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:48,209
Good girl, good girl.

1181
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:49,126
Uh, hey, it's me.

1182
00:59:49,126 --> 00:59:50,211
Look, Ms. Callucci is here,

1183
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,755
so could you just call me
when you pick up this message?

1184
00:59:54,381 --> 00:59:56,050
-Hi.
-Ms. Callucci?

1185
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:57,927
At last. You must be--

1186
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:58,969
I thought
you were going to meet

1187
00:59:58,969 --> 01:00:00,012
with Allegra at your office.

1188
01:00:00,012 --> 01:00:02,932
No, we had always scheduled
a 4:00 home visit for today.

1189
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,517
-She didn't tell you?
-Oh no, she did,

1190
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:06,310
but there just must
have been a mix-up.

1191
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:09,772
Ah, well, if she doesn't come
soon, we can call my office.

1192
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:13,150
In the meantime, do you mind
if we get started, Mr. Marshall?

1193
01:00:15,027 --> 01:00:16,612
(Emily crying)

1194
01:00:16,612 --> 01:00:19,323
Yeah, she seems tired.

1195
01:00:19,323 --> 01:00:21,784
(crying continues)

1196
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:24,453
Well, it's nice to see you
bonding with her,

1197
01:00:24,453 --> 01:00:27,748
especially since
you've been away so much.

1198
01:00:27,748 --> 01:00:28,582
You know, well, actually--

1199
01:00:28,582 --> 01:00:31,502
Yes, you were very difficult
to pin down.

1200
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:34,171
Now we have to visit
both of you, in this case,

1201
01:00:34,171 --> 01:00:37,550
because of the birth mother's
imperative:

1202
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,677
She was alone
and is very clear

1203
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:40,970
about wanting her daughter

1204
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:43,139
raised
in a two-parent household.

1205
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,307
No, I do understand that.

1206
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:51,230
How has having Emily affected
your relationship with Allegra?

1207
01:00:53,607 --> 01:00:57,903
Um, well,
she's happy being a mother,

1208
01:00:57,903 --> 01:01:01,490
and that in turn
makes me happy.

1209
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:03,367
Is it different,
having a girl?

1210
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:07,663
I don't think so.

1211
01:01:07,663 --> 01:01:09,123
Alex is going to get older,

1212
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:10,666
and then he and I
will do things,

1213
01:01:10,666 --> 01:01:15,588
and Emily and Allegra
can do things.

1214
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:17,590
Wait, so you're adopting a child

1215
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:19,967
to balance your books,
so to speak?

1216
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:23,637
No, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean it that way.

1217
01:01:23,637 --> 01:01:24,930
(she chuckles)

1218
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:29,268
Um, I guess being around
the kids,

1219
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:33,022
I've been able to discover,
I guess,

1220
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:35,524
deeper feelings for Allegra.

1221
01:01:35,524 --> 01:01:38,944
It's sort of like
seeing somebody in a new light,

1222
01:01:38,944 --> 01:01:41,989
um, almost like
discovering a new person.

1223
01:01:43,782 --> 01:01:45,451
Well, that's so nice.

1224
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:52,791
Uh, this form is a formality.

1225
01:01:52,791 --> 01:01:58,214
Uh, okay, but I usually just
let the lawyers look at it.

1226
01:01:58,214 --> 01:01:59,548
Hi.

1227
01:01:59,548 --> 01:02:01,383
I am so sorry
about the mix-up.

1228
01:02:01,383 --> 01:02:02,760
I didn't realize
it was a home visit.

1229
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,221
My secretary
must have gotten it wrong.

1230
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:07,681
Well, your husband and I
have had a lovely chat.

1231
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:11,894
Really?

1232
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:14,355
It's so helpful having
two such active parents

1233
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:15,814
to take up the slack.

1234
01:02:15,814 --> 01:02:17,983
George was just telling me
how all of this

1235
01:02:17,983 --> 01:02:20,694
has changed your relationship
for the better.

1236
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:25,032
Right, um...

1237
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:26,533
Would you excuse us
for a second?

1238
01:02:26,533 --> 01:02:28,452
I just need to grab a glass
of water.

1239
01:02:28,452 --> 01:02:30,579
Oh, certainly.

1240
01:02:30,579 --> 01:02:31,914
We'll be right back,
Miss Callucci.

1241
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,207
Sure.

1242
01:02:35,459 --> 01:02:36,919
You told her
you were my husband?

1243
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:39,213
No, I did not.
The new maid did.

1244
01:02:40,839 --> 01:02:42,675
She just started
asking questions,

1245
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:43,592
so I played along.

1246
01:02:43,592 --> 01:02:46,428
I thought it was
the right thing to do.

1247
01:02:46,428 --> 01:02:47,513
What were you thinking?

1248
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:49,181
I didn't think,
I just reacted.

1249
01:02:49,181 --> 01:02:51,058
And I thought it would help.

1250
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,605
What do I tell her now?

1251
01:02:58,065 --> 01:02:59,566
Mr. Singer!

1252
01:02:59,566 --> 01:03:00,526
(soft quirky music)

1253
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:05,030
A lie is a failure
to understand oneself.

1254
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:11,704
These are precisely the ways
in which we derail our lives.

1255
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:16,125
I didn't purposely plan on it.

1256
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:19,503
No one ever does, Mr. Singer.

1257
01:03:19,503 --> 01:03:22,506
Nevertheless,
when you start to drive

1258
01:03:22,506 --> 01:03:24,800
ass-backward through life,

1259
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,594
it can be very hard to stop.

1260
01:03:27,594 --> 01:03:29,471
And you realize too late

1261
01:03:29,471 --> 01:03:32,308
the major decisions
of your life

1262
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:33,642
are lying in the road

1263
01:03:33,642 --> 01:03:36,603
like so many
crushed squirrels.

1264
01:03:36,603 --> 01:03:39,106
(soft music)

1265
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:45,195
I guess we have
to tell her the truth.

1266
01:03:45,195 --> 01:03:47,197
Yeah, I guess.

1267
01:03:48,782 --> 01:03:50,868
No, I thought his name
was George.

1268
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:54,163
No--well, yeah, it, um,
yes, it was George.

1269
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:55,998
This is my friend
Jake Singer.

1270
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:58,917
My husband George
died ten months ago,

1271
01:03:58,917 --> 01:04:01,295
and I've just gotten back
on my feet.

1272
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:02,963
I'm so sorry.

1273
01:04:02,963 --> 01:04:05,966
I should have told you
this sooner.

1274
01:04:05,966 --> 01:04:06,884
I see.

1275
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:09,219
Well, this is most unusual.

1276
01:04:09,219 --> 01:04:12,389
I went to your office today
to clarify this,

1277
01:04:12,389 --> 01:04:15,851
I'm sure you can imagine
how difficult it's been.

1278
01:04:15,851 --> 01:04:18,479
You see, Emily is meant
to be my daughter.

1279
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:22,524
We've gotten so close
and I love her so much.

1280
01:04:22,524 --> 01:04:23,734
But you do know about

1281
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:25,527
the two-parent stipulation,
of course?

1282
01:04:25,527 --> 01:04:27,029
Of course I do,
but that's just it.

1283
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:30,574
I mean, there must be
some way around it.

1284
01:04:30,574 --> 01:04:33,243
Well, why don't we put this
aside for the moment.

1285
01:04:33,243 --> 01:04:34,870
Yes, let's reschedule

1286
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:38,040
and I can do
the data collection later.

1287
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:45,589
Miss Callucci,
I would just like to apologize.

1288
01:04:45,589 --> 01:04:47,216
You better get
your stories straight.

1289
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:48,967
Now this is not a game.

1290
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:51,970
I'll be in touch very soon.

1291
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:53,639
Thank you.

1292
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:56,141
(soft, pensive music)

1293
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:20,457
Goodbye, Mr. Marshall.

1294
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:25,045
(gate slams)

1295
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,382
It gives me no satisfaction,
you know,

1296
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:32,052
that this ill-advised
emotional involvement

1297
01:05:32,052 --> 01:05:34,096
shall only have brought
everyone more pain.

1298
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:37,057
But I still think that,
given half a chance,

1299
01:05:37,057 --> 01:05:38,183
she and I could be
good together,

1300
01:05:38,183 --> 01:05:39,101
we could move forward.

1301
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:40,853
You're not even facing forward.

1302
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:42,229
That is not fair.

1303
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:45,190
Life is unfair, Mr. Singer,

1304
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:48,068
but that is a ballad you should
restrict to the shower.

1305
01:05:49,653 --> 01:05:51,488
You had a good chance
to make a clean break.

1306
01:05:51,488 --> 01:05:52,364
What did you do?

1307
01:05:52,364 --> 01:05:53,532
You involved yourself further.

1308
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:55,701
But I don't want
to make a clean break.

1309
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:57,286
You disregarded my advice.

1310
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:59,037
I have followed a lot
of your advice,

1311
01:05:59,037 --> 01:06:02,124
but when I don't
you act like it's a betrayal.

1312
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:04,084
You're worse than my father.
And I am not your son.

1313
01:06:04,084 --> 01:06:07,296
I am not the cause
of your unhappiness.

1314
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:09,089
My father said the same thing,
and I know it,

1315
01:06:09,089 --> 01:06:13,594
but maybe it's us
who should make a clean break.

1316
01:06:18,223 --> 01:06:19,641
I've tried my best.

1317
01:06:19,641 --> 01:06:22,144
And you have
given me a lot.

1318
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:24,646
But for now...

1319
01:06:24,646 --> 01:06:26,482
(music intensifies)

1320
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:27,774
...it's enough.

1321
01:06:28,817 --> 01:06:30,444
Maybe another time.

1322
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:37,493
There are no maybes, Mr. Singer.

1323
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:40,537
You walk out that door,
our work is over.

1324
01:06:40,537 --> 01:06:42,164
You understand
what I'm telling you?

1325
01:06:44,833 --> 01:06:46,084
(footsteps)

1326
01:07:01,808 --> 01:07:04,311
(door opens, slams)

1327
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:07,564
(soft music)

1328
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:39,513
I was going to mail it,
but it was too much trouble.

1329
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:41,557
I thought somebody had died.

1330
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:42,766
Who's left?

1331
01:07:44,101 --> 01:07:45,435
Thank you, Dad.

1332
01:07:45,435 --> 01:07:46,687
I appreciate it.

1333
01:07:49,189 --> 01:07:50,857
What's the matter?

1334
01:07:50,857 --> 01:07:53,735
Oh, it's a long story
but in short,

1335
01:07:53,735 --> 01:07:56,780
I found myself pretending to be
Allegra's dead husband,

1336
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:58,407
to help with the adoption.

1337
01:08:00,075 --> 01:08:03,161
-Uh-huh, and...?
-I don't know.

1338
01:08:03,161 --> 01:08:04,997
I think I made a mistake
in the heat of the moment,

1339
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:07,207
and it might be too late.

1340
01:08:07,207 --> 01:08:08,584
She's upset?

1341
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:09,668
(he chuckles softly)

1342
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:11,920
Yes.

1343
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,256
Well, what does
your therapist advise?

1344
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:20,637
You're my only doctor now, Dad,
so advise away.

1345
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,854
I don't know, Jake.

1346
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:31,231
You've got to trust
your instincts.

1347
01:08:31,231 --> 01:08:32,399
Yeah, the last time
I did that, Dad,

1348
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:35,819
I got my head cracked open
and then I lost my girlfriend.

1349
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:37,738
So what more
have you got to lose?

1350
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:39,781
My pride, my dignity.

1351
01:08:41,491 --> 01:08:44,244
Ephemera, Jake...

1352
01:08:44,244 --> 01:08:45,829
Illusions.

1353
01:08:50,834 --> 01:08:52,794
Oh, hey, hey, did I tell you?

1354
01:08:52,794 --> 01:08:53,879
No.

1355
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:56,048
I got the London semester.

1356
01:08:56,048 --> 01:08:56,882
That's great.

1357
01:08:56,882 --> 01:09:00,427
So, maybe next year
you could come and visit?

1358
01:09:00,427 --> 01:09:02,512
That would be grand,
I'd like that.

1359
01:09:09,603 --> 01:09:11,146
Don't give up.

1360
01:09:13,231 --> 01:09:14,524
Thanks, Dad.

1361
01:09:14,524 --> 01:09:16,485
I've got to go.

1362
01:09:20,197 --> 01:09:21,782
(office sounds)

1363
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:23,450
Mrs. Callucci.

1364
01:09:24,868 --> 01:09:26,662
I just want a moment
of your time.

1365
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:28,747
You already had that.

1366
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:30,290
I would like to marry Allegra.

1367
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:32,167
I'd like to try being a father
to Emily.

1368
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:35,337
I realized that
while I was speaking to you.

1369
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:36,880
Let me ask you something.

1370
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:37,923
Did you start seeing her

1371
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:40,342
before or after
her husband died?

1372
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:41,718
No, after, after.

1373
01:09:41,718 --> 01:09:42,928
I just met her after.

1374
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:45,180
So you barely know her,
is that it?

1375
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:47,724
No, I think I know her
very well.

1376
01:09:47,724 --> 01:09:49,351
Starting a family, Mr. Singer,

1377
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:52,562
requires thinking beyond
the heat of the moment.

1378
01:09:52,562 --> 01:09:55,023
Now, I am obligated
to tell the adoption agency

1379
01:09:55,023 --> 01:09:56,858
what caused the holdup
in state approval.

1380
01:09:56,858 --> 01:09:58,443
After that,
it's their decision.

1381
01:09:58,443 --> 01:10:00,737
I can't interfere.

1382
01:10:00,737 --> 01:10:04,908
Can't or won't?

1383
01:10:04,908 --> 01:10:08,286
I don't like being lied to,
Mr. Singer.

1384
01:10:08,286 --> 01:10:10,038
Please excuse me.

1385
01:10:17,212 --> 01:10:18,380
Now what?

1386
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:20,132
At least let me know
what you think of the ring?

1387
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:23,969
My father gave this
to my mother,

1388
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:27,514
and I hope to give it
to Allegra.

1389
01:10:27,514 --> 01:10:29,141
Good luck to you.

1390
01:10:29,141 --> 01:10:31,184
Now please go.

1391
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:33,729
Give her another chance.

1392
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:35,105
She deserves it
and so does Emily.

1393
01:10:35,105 --> 01:10:37,941
And to be frank, Ms. Callucci,
so do I.

1394
01:10:39,651 --> 01:10:42,154
(soft music)

1395
01:10:43,488 --> 01:10:45,323
It's Jake.

1396
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:51,830
I'm sorry.

1397
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:52,998
She doesn't want to.

1398
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:54,124
I know this is hard.

1399
01:10:54,124 --> 01:10:55,876
(sighs)

1400
01:10:55,876 --> 01:10:58,628
I know you meant well.

1401
01:10:58,628 --> 01:11:00,005
Don't tell her
I told you this,

1402
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:01,923
but she's having lunch
around the corner

1403
01:11:01,923 --> 01:11:04,342
tomorrow at one.

1404
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,267
Jake?

1405
01:11:12,267 --> 01:11:14,519
Julia, hey.

1406
01:11:14,519 --> 01:11:15,812
-Wow.

1407
01:11:15,812 --> 01:11:17,647
- I know, right.
-Congratulations.

1408
01:11:17,647 --> 01:11:19,024
Thank you.

1409
01:11:20,275 --> 01:11:21,443
Are you okay?

1410
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:24,446
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

1411
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:27,157
I hear you're dating
an older woman.

1412
01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:30,118
Oh, you know,
not all widows are older.

1413
01:11:30,118 --> 01:11:32,204
But how's married life
anyway?

1414
01:11:32,204 --> 01:11:34,247
Well, it's good.

1415
01:11:34,247 --> 01:11:36,208
It's not easy, but it's good.

1416
01:11:37,125 --> 01:11:39,753
Listen, Julia,

1417
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:42,172
did we ever stand a chance,
you and me?

1418
01:11:42,172 --> 01:11:43,465
Sure. Of course.

1419
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:44,299
No, seriously.

1420
01:11:44,299 --> 01:11:47,219
If I had gotten
my act together,

1421
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:49,012
would you have taken me on?

1422
01:11:50,263 --> 01:11:54,142
Yeah, more than you realize.

1423
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:01,316
What is wrong?

1424
01:12:03,235 --> 01:12:05,445
Nothing,
um, I just have to go.

1425
01:12:05,445 --> 01:12:06,655
Listen, congratulations.

1426
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,573
Thank you.

1427
01:12:08,573 --> 01:12:10,116
-Bye.
-Bye.

1428
01:12:17,374 --> 01:12:19,251
-I'll see you soon, Bye
-Bye.

1429
01:12:23,296 --> 01:12:24,464
Allegra.

1430
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:27,926
Jake, what are you doing here?

1431
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:30,095
Claire told me you'd be here.

1432
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:32,848
Listen.

1433
01:12:34,391 --> 01:12:38,103
I did a stupid thing,
and I'm sorry.

1434
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:43,358
But I love you but I don't want
to lose you over it.

1435
01:12:44,818 --> 01:12:45,777
I want to be with you.

1436
01:12:45,777 --> 01:12:48,947
I want to try to be a father
to Alex and Emily.

1437
01:12:48,947 --> 01:12:51,032
And I know
that you're scared,

1438
01:12:51,032 --> 01:12:54,244
but just think about this
for a second.

1439
01:12:56,121 --> 01:12:59,541
The birth mother's stipulation
is a two-parent family.

1440
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:02,627
So even if it didn't work,

1441
01:13:02,627 --> 01:13:04,254
you'd still have Emily.

1442
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:11,428
That's not what it's about,
Jake.

1443
01:13:14,222 --> 01:13:16,433
My husband died
less than a year ago.

1444
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:21,229
I'm--I'm just not ready
to have another one yet.

1445
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:31,990
I'm sorry.
I should go.

1446
01:13:39,497 --> 01:13:42,000
(soft music)

1447
01:13:45,253 --> 01:13:47,756
(basketballs bouncing,
shoes squeaking)

1448
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:55,430
Hey, come on.

1449
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:56,473
We need you.

1450
01:13:56,473 --> 01:13:57,515
Come play.

1451
01:14:41,768 --> 01:14:44,270
(Emily babbling)

1452
01:14:46,398 --> 01:14:49,067
Are you pulling them out
at the same time?

1453
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:51,069
No, that's too many.

1454
01:14:51,069 --> 01:14:52,445
(Emily babbling)

1455
01:14:52,445 --> 01:14:53,655
(Allegra chuckling)

1456
01:14:55,365 --> 01:14:56,533
Hi, Ms. Callucci.

1457
01:14:56,533 --> 01:14:58,243
Thank you for coming back in.

1458
01:14:59,577 --> 01:15:00,870
Thank you.

1459
01:15:00,870 --> 01:15:04,207
Jacob, I have here
the rough draft

1460
01:15:04,207 --> 01:15:06,418
of the London itinerary.

1461
01:15:06,418 --> 01:15:08,044
I'm sure you'll have
some ideas of your own,

1462
01:15:08,044 --> 01:15:10,839
but I thought
we'd better start planning.

1463
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:14,801
We've had a record number
of students apply.

1464
01:15:14,801 --> 01:15:16,261
The Freud Museum, huh?

1465
01:15:16,261 --> 01:15:17,887
Oh, yes, yes,
the Freud Museum.

1466
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:19,764
That's a must.

1467
01:15:19,764 --> 01:15:21,558
That's a must. Come.

1468
01:15:21,558 --> 01:15:23,518
Okay, I know that this
is the last day of class,

1469
01:15:23,518 --> 01:15:28,398
but please let us try
to concentrate.

1470
01:15:28,398 --> 01:15:30,400
This is a particularly good day
to discuss The Stranger,

1471
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,651
since many of you
are about to face

1472
01:15:31,651 --> 01:15:34,070
the existential dilemma
of the summer:

1473
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:36,114
internship in
your father's corporation

1474
01:15:36,114 --> 01:15:38,700
or beach with friends.

1475
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:43,997
Phil, how did you manage
with The Stranger?

1476
01:15:43,997 --> 01:15:46,124
Uh, okay, I guess.

1477
01:15:46,124 --> 01:15:48,001
I mean,
it's really frustrating.

1478
01:15:48,001 --> 01:15:51,713
I was waiting
for this huge, profound moral

1479
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:54,382
and nothing--
it just didn't happen.

1480
01:15:54,382 --> 01:15:57,635
Chris, what do you think
Camus is trying to say?

1481
01:15:57,635 --> 01:16:00,847
Maybe that like modern man's
like in serious trouble

1482
01:16:00,847 --> 01:16:03,725
if he doesn't feel
any allegiances to anything?

1483
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:05,435
Scott, what kind of trouble?

1484
01:16:05,435 --> 01:16:08,396
I mean, the guy just drifts,
everything is a hassle for him:

1485
01:16:08,396 --> 01:16:12,275
family, religion, civil law.

1486
01:16:12,275 --> 01:16:17,363
Okay, so, the difficult process
of self-definition

1487
01:16:17,363 --> 01:16:23,036
can be avoided and you can
just glide through the world.

1488
01:16:23,036 --> 01:16:24,829
But that would be
everyone's loss?

1489
01:16:24,829 --> 01:16:28,583
Yeah, but I still don't know
why he had to shoot that guy.

1490
01:16:28,583 --> 01:16:30,752
I mean, he could have
just shot in the air

1491
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:32,337
and scared them off.

1492
01:16:32,337 --> 01:16:34,005
What would your father say?

1493
01:16:34,005 --> 01:16:35,632
I don't think he's read Camus.

1494
01:16:35,632 --> 01:16:37,133
(laughter)

1495
01:16:37,133 --> 01:16:39,511
What do you think he'd say?

1496
01:16:42,514 --> 01:16:44,682
Wrong place, wrong time.

1497
01:16:44,682 --> 01:16:48,561
But he's still responsible
for what he did.

1498
01:16:48,561 --> 01:16:49,979
So,

1499
01:16:49,979 --> 01:16:55,944
much of what makes us
who we are

1500
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:57,862
is up to chance.

1501
01:16:57,862 --> 01:16:59,280
There are many forces
out there

1502
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,491
that are beyond our control.

1503
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:04,160
But you can't stand apart.

1504
01:17:07,664 --> 01:17:10,542
You have to embrace.

1505
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:12,627
The difficult job of life

1506
01:17:12,627 --> 01:17:15,630
is building a structure
for yourself,

1507
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:17,423
out of the remnants
of your past

1508
01:17:17,423 --> 01:17:22,137
but also having the faith

1509
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:26,099
that your talents
will provide for your future.

1510
01:17:26,099 --> 01:17:28,893
Hey, that's exactly
what I wrote on my paper.

1511
01:17:28,893 --> 01:17:30,186
(laughter)

1512
01:17:30,186 --> 01:17:32,772
Did you copy me, Mr. Singer?

1513
01:17:32,772 --> 01:17:34,232
(laughter)

1514
01:17:34,232 --> 01:17:36,192
(bell rings)

1515
01:17:36,192 --> 01:17:37,527
Okay.

1516
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:41,156
Have a good summer.

1517
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:43,408
(cheering, applause)

1518
01:17:43,408 --> 01:17:46,202
Mr. Singer,
have fun in London, baby!

1519
01:17:46,202 --> 01:17:49,622
Hey, Mr. Singer,
have a jolly good time

1520
01:17:49,622 --> 01:17:52,041
eating bangers and mash
in London!

1521
01:17:52,041 --> 01:17:53,251
Thank you very much.

1522
01:17:53,251 --> 01:17:54,294
Have a good summer, you guys.

1523
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:55,503
Cheerio, Singer.

1524
01:17:55,503 --> 01:17:56,754
(he chuckles)

1525
01:18:00,592 --> 01:18:01,634
Hi.

1526
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:03,303
Hi.

1527
01:18:04,304 --> 01:18:06,931
Did you get my messages?

1528
01:18:06,931 --> 01:18:08,183
Yeah.

1529
01:18:09,434 --> 01:18:11,186
You didn't call back.

1530
01:18:13,396 --> 01:18:16,316
Look, I wanted
to tell you something.

1531
01:18:16,316 --> 01:18:17,650
I have to go.

1532
01:18:17,650 --> 01:18:19,819
No, I just wanted to say
I'm sorry.

1533
01:18:19,819 --> 01:18:20,653
It's okay.

1534
01:18:20,653 --> 01:18:22,113
I was wrong to blame you.

1535
01:18:22,113 --> 01:18:23,198
It wasn't fair.

1536
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:24,574
It's fine.

1537
01:18:26,075 --> 01:18:28,077
Look, I know you're upset
with me,

1538
01:18:28,077 --> 01:18:29,412
but I just want to thank you.

1539
01:18:29,412 --> 01:18:31,206
Whatever you did
or whatever you told Callucci

1540
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:32,582
made a difference.

1541
01:18:32,582 --> 01:18:35,043
Emily can stay with me.

1542
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:37,962
Good, I'm glad.

1543
01:18:37,962 --> 01:18:39,547
I'm glad it worked out.

1544
01:18:46,638 --> 01:18:47,764
Jake.

1545
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:50,683
I've missed you.

1546
01:18:51,976 --> 01:18:53,478
I've missed you too.

1547
01:18:57,482 --> 01:18:59,609
I don't understand.

1548
01:18:59,609 --> 01:19:01,611
Have you met someone else?

1549
01:19:04,739 --> 01:19:07,200
No,

1550
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,285
but I've held on
to someone else for too long,

1551
01:19:09,285 --> 01:19:11,079
and it almost killed me.

1552
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:16,668
But it didn't,
it didn't kill you, did it?

1553
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,131
No.

1554
01:19:24,634 --> 01:19:27,345
That's what love is, Jake.

1555
01:19:27,345 --> 01:19:29,347
It isn't your sanguine sunrise

1556
01:19:29,347 --> 01:19:31,808
or your deep embattled clouds.

1557
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:36,479
It's seeing your husband die

1558
01:19:36,479 --> 01:19:39,941
and being able
to stand up again,

1559
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:41,192
or getting your heart broken

1560
01:19:41,192 --> 01:19:44,404
and being brave enough
to try again.

1561
01:19:56,165 --> 01:20:00,086
Can you please
take me home, please?

1562
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:08,761
Give me a second, huh?

1563
01:20:08,761 --> 01:20:10,680
I'll be right back, okay?

1564
01:20:23,443 --> 01:20:24,610
(aggressive shouting)

1565
01:20:24,610 --> 01:20:26,487
(pensive music)

1566
01:20:26,487 --> 01:20:27,989
Are you really going
to follow through

1567
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:29,407
with this mistake?

1568
01:20:29,407 --> 01:20:30,575
Give me that back and get out.

1569
01:20:30,575 --> 01:20:32,618
You're giving me an ultimatum?

1570
01:20:32,618 --> 01:20:33,745
You haven't a clue
what you're doing.

1571
01:20:33,745 --> 01:20:36,205
I am asking you to please go.

1572
01:20:36,205 --> 01:20:38,875
And I am saying
that your unconscious

1573
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:41,294
is pleading for me to stay.

1574
01:20:41,294 --> 01:20:43,338
I labored to unlock your psyche,

1575
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:46,716
and you fled at the first sign
of improvement.

1576
01:20:47,884 --> 01:20:49,594
Oh, you admit it.

1577
01:20:49,594 --> 01:20:50,470
I'm improved.

1578
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:52,847
But you have so much more.

1579
01:20:52,847 --> 01:20:55,475
That I could only get from you.

1580
01:20:59,479 --> 01:21:03,900
I'm the last great Freudian,
Mr. Singer.

1581
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:07,653
The last in a line stretching
from Moses to Aristotle

1582
01:21:07,653 --> 01:21:09,781
to Cicero to Milton.

1583
01:21:14,452 --> 01:21:17,955
Moral visionaries.

1584
01:21:17,955 --> 01:21:21,167
You think you have found
your answer in this woman,

1585
01:21:21,167 --> 01:21:23,628
but you are still looking
for the mother you have lost.

1586
01:21:23,628 --> 01:21:28,674
I know that I am better
in a relationship than alone.

1587
01:21:28,674 --> 01:21:31,677
Better in love.

1588
01:21:31,677 --> 01:21:34,347
There is so much more
that you could be

1589
01:21:34,347 --> 01:21:36,849
but will never come near
if you take this easy road.

1590
01:21:36,849 --> 01:21:38,726
Admit it,
at least to yourself.

1591
01:21:38,726 --> 01:21:40,812
I--I don't think
this is gonna be easy,

1592
01:21:40,812 --> 01:21:43,689
to be a father
to her children?

1593
01:21:43,689 --> 01:21:44,941
But...

1594
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:49,862
I'm willing to take a shot, Doc.

1595
01:21:49,862 --> 01:21:52,073
And I'm getting married.

1596
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:54,492
And you're not invited.

1597
01:21:54,492 --> 01:21:55,660
So, scram.

1598
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:57,870
(energetic music)

1599
01:21:57,870 --> 01:21:59,705
-This is your last chance!
-Get in the closet.

1600
01:21:59,705 --> 01:22:01,707
Don't be a fool!

1601
01:22:01,707 --> 01:22:02,959
(dramatic music)

1602
01:22:02,959 --> 01:22:04,502
(soft music)

1603
01:22:04,502 --> 01:22:05,837
Jake?

1604
01:22:08,047 --> 01:22:09,340
Hey.

1605
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:11,676
What's in the closet?

1606
01:22:11,676 --> 01:22:14,345
Just junk, old junk.

1607
01:22:14,345 --> 01:22:15,680
Too much.

1608
01:22:16,889 --> 01:22:18,474
Too much.

1609
01:22:21,769 --> 01:22:23,271
Are you okay?

1610
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:25,440
You look like
you've seen a ghost?

1611
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:30,570
Um, I don't believe in ghosts.

1612
01:22:34,615 --> 01:22:37,118
(door creaking)

1613
01:22:39,745 --> 01:22:42,248
(quirky, pensive music)
