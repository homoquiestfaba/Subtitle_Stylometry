1
00:01:07,454 --> 00:01:10,014
- You okay?
- I'm fine, mate. Don't worry about it.

2
00:01:10,374 --> 00:01:11,932
You all right?

3
00:01:13,614 --> 00:01:15,172
Enjoy L.A.

4
00:02:19,854 --> 00:02:21,412
- He did it.
- It's all right.

5
00:02:58,734 --> 00:03:00,292
Tell me why everything
is always about you.

6
00:03:00,494 --> 00:03:01,813
Everything is not always about me.

7
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:04,164
That gearhead with his
pocket protector was being sarcastic,

8
00:03:04,374 --> 00:03:06,569
- and you know it.
- Sorry, I just didn't see it that way.

9
00:03:06,774 --> 00:03:09,846
Bullshit. What about the dig about
the makeover? That was really nice.

10
00:03:10,054 --> 00:03:12,284
What do you want me to do?
I work with the man, for chrissake.

11
00:03:12,494 --> 00:03:15,054
You know what? You're perfectly
capable of taking care of your own shit.

12
00:03:15,454 --> 00:03:18,287
You know something? The last time
I checked, you were sleeping with me.

13
00:03:18,494 --> 00:03:21,770
So unless you want to start
fucking him, I suggest...

14
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:18,205
Hey, pal. Where can I catch a shuttle
to the airport around here?

15
00:04:18,414 --> 00:04:20,848
- Back there.
- Thanks.

16
00:04:31,574 --> 00:04:34,008
It was him in that gold Lexus
on the cell phone.

17
00:04:37,934 --> 00:04:40,243
Are they still asking
for a change of venue?

18
00:04:40,454 --> 00:04:43,890
He's enhanceable because of priors
in the early '80s.

19
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:49,766
- Where to?
- Downtown. 312 North Spring Street.

20
00:04:49,974 --> 00:04:51,373
Downtown.

21
00:04:55,014 --> 00:04:59,132
Look, the transcriptions need
to be done by 7 a.m., period, okay?

22
00:05:00,054 --> 00:05:03,091
Hold on. Take Sepulveda
to Slauson to La Brea.

23
00:05:03,294 --> 00:05:06,286
Take La Brea north to Sixth
into downtown.

24
00:05:07,654 --> 00:05:10,964
So what? You'll be up late. I'm pulling
an all-nighter too, so save the tears.

25
00:05:11,174 --> 00:05:12,573
I'll take the 105 east to the 110.

26
00:05:12,774 --> 00:05:14,287
- That's faster.
- What?

27
00:05:14,494 --> 00:05:16,962
I said, the 105 to the 110,
that'll get you there quicker.

28
00:05:17,174 --> 00:05:19,483
The 110 turns into a parking lot
around USC.

29
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:23,607
But once you get to La Brea north
of Santa Monica, then it's jammed.

30
00:05:23,814 --> 00:05:24,929
The 110 north of the 10,

31
00:05:25,134 --> 00:05:27,932
you get people driving to Pasadena,
and they drive slow.

32
00:05:28,134 --> 00:05:32,286
Yeah, they do, but what I do is
I get off on Grand, and then I...

33
00:05:33,694 --> 00:05:36,686
Hey, surface roads is what you want,
that's what we'll do.

34
00:05:40,414 --> 00:05:43,087
- Are we taking bets?
- Are we?

35
00:05:43,294 --> 00:05:44,932
But what if you're wrong?

36
00:05:45,134 --> 00:05:49,844
I don't think I'm gonna be wrong,
but if I am, the ride's free.

37
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:55,243
Okay, you got yourself a deal.

38
00:06:18,614 --> 00:06:20,605
- Go ahead, say it.
- Say what?

39
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:23,123
- Go ahead.
- Oh, I got lucky with the lights.

40
00:06:23,334 --> 00:06:25,484
You weren't lucky with the lights.
What you were was right.

41
00:06:25,694 --> 00:06:27,491
I was wrong...

42
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:30,523
...Max.

43
00:06:39,534 --> 00:06:41,092
You mind turning that up?

44
00:06:41,294 --> 00:06:45,333
- You like the classics.
- I do. I used to play in high school.

45
00:06:45,534 --> 00:06:47,809
- Let me guess. Woodwinds.
- No. Strings.

46
00:06:48,014 --> 00:06:49,572
I never had the lungs
for wind instruments.

47
00:06:49,774 --> 00:06:52,925
Could've fooled me by the way
you were unloading on that cell phone.

48
00:06:53,134 --> 00:06:54,852
Different instrument.

49
00:06:56,214 --> 00:06:59,570
If you had just listened to me, we'd be
all bogged down in traffic right now,

50
00:06:59,774 --> 00:07:01,685
and you would've made yourself
an extra 5 bucks.

51
00:07:01,894 --> 00:07:06,046
Yeah, well, you keep that 5 bucks.
Buy you something special. Go wild.

52
00:07:06,414 --> 00:07:10,043
Really, it's not that... It's not a big deal.
Nothing big here.

53
00:07:10,534 --> 00:07:11,887
Well, how many cabbies
do you know

54
00:07:12,094 --> 00:07:13,846
get you into an argument
to save you money?

55
00:07:14,054 --> 00:07:18,047
There were two of us. I had to kill
the other one. I don't like competition.

56
00:07:22,014 --> 00:07:24,084
Take pride in being good
at what you do?

57
00:07:24,294 --> 00:07:27,650
What, this? Oh, this is...
This is... No, this is part-time.

58
00:07:27,854 --> 00:07:30,288
This is a fill-in job. Pay the bills.

59
00:07:30,494 --> 00:07:34,692
But I will be the best at what I do.
But that's something else.

60
00:07:37,454 --> 00:07:41,208
- What else?
- Just shaping up some things.

61
00:07:41,414 --> 00:07:42,893
Like...?

62
00:07:44,414 --> 00:07:45,324
Tell me.

63
00:07:45,534 --> 00:07:48,048
Limo company I'm putting together.
Island Limos.

64
00:07:48,254 --> 00:07:51,690
It's gonna be like an island on wheels.
A cool groove, like a club experience.

65
00:07:51,894 --> 00:07:55,011
When you get to the airport, you're not
gonna wanna get out of my limo.

66
00:07:55,214 --> 00:07:57,853
So I do this part-time
to get my Benz off leases,

67
00:07:58,054 --> 00:08:01,603
staff up, get the right client list.
You know, things like that.

68
00:08:03,814 --> 00:08:05,884
How do you like being a lawyer?

69
00:08:07,974 --> 00:08:10,044
- What are you, psychic?
- Little bit.

70
00:08:10,254 --> 00:08:11,733
There's the dark pinstripe suit.

71
00:08:11,934 --> 00:08:14,129
Elegant, not too flashy.
That rules out advertising.

72
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:17,087
Plus a top-drawer briefcase
that you live out of.

73
00:08:17,294 --> 00:08:20,445
And the purse. A Bottega.

74
00:08:20,814 --> 00:08:24,773
Anyway, a man gets in my cab with
a sword, I figure he's a sushi chef.

75
00:08:25,814 --> 00:08:29,204
You? Clarence Darrow.

76
00:08:29,414 --> 00:08:33,248
Well, no, not quite.
He worked defense. I'm a prosecutor.

77
00:08:33,454 --> 00:08:35,809
- Big case?
- Yeah.

78
00:09:16,494 --> 00:09:18,610
- Got us here fast.
- Of course.

79
00:09:18,974 --> 00:09:21,249
But you didn't answer my question.

80
00:09:22,294 --> 00:09:24,125
Do you like what you do?

81
00:09:25,894 --> 00:09:27,213
Yeah.

82
00:09:30,054 --> 00:09:31,772
But not today.

83
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:35,930
No, I do. Like, I can't wait.

84
00:09:36,454 --> 00:09:39,810
I love standing in that courtroom.
At the same time,

85
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:43,927
I get this clenched-up thing
the night before the first days.

86
00:09:45,654 --> 00:09:48,327
Clenched up? How?

87
00:10:00,174 --> 00:10:03,007
I think I'm gonna lose.
I think the case sucks,

88
00:10:03,214 --> 00:10:05,444
my exhibits aren't in order,
I'm not prepared enough,

89
00:10:05,654 --> 00:10:07,884
people are gonna find out
that I don't know what I'm doing,

90
00:10:08,094 --> 00:10:10,528
and I've been running some charade
all these years.

91
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:12,565
I represent
the Department of Justice,

92
00:10:12,774 --> 00:10:15,686
and my opening statement is gonna
fall flat at the most important point,

93
00:10:15,894 --> 00:10:17,247
and the jury's gonna laugh at me.

94
00:10:21,614 --> 00:10:24,208
And then I cry. I don't throw up.

95
00:10:24,414 --> 00:10:27,690
A lot of people throw up.
I have a strong stomach.

96
00:10:28,214 --> 00:10:32,127
And then I pull myself together,
I rewrite my opening statement,

97
00:10:32,334 --> 00:10:35,770
work my exhibits, and that's
what I do for the rest of the night.

98
00:10:35,974 --> 00:10:37,646
That's my routine.

99
00:10:40,814 --> 00:10:46,332
- In the morning, it starts, and I'm fine.
- You need a vacation.

100
00:10:46,534 --> 00:10:48,729
I just had a vacation
on the Harbor Freeway.

101
00:10:48,934 --> 00:10:51,448
No, no, not in a cab. I mean,
you need to get your head straight.

102
00:10:51,654 --> 00:10:54,646
Get your unified self up.
Get harmonic. You know...

103
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,367
When was the last time
you took a break?

104
00:10:56,574 --> 00:10:57,893
I go on a vacation all the time.

105
00:10:58,094 --> 00:11:00,324
- How often?
- A dozen times a day.

106
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,252
My favorite spot.

107
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,365
Maldives Island.

108
00:11:07,374 --> 00:11:10,605
It's my own private getaway.
Things get heavy for me,

109
00:11:10,814 --> 00:11:14,284
I take five minutes out,
and I just go there.

110
00:11:14,734 --> 00:11:17,806
And I just concentrate
on absolutely nothing.

111
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:26,612
- Here. Take it.
- Oh, no. I couldn't do that.

112
00:11:26,814 --> 00:11:29,612
Take it. Take it, because you
need it a lot more than I do.

113
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,009
And it'll help you. I guarantee it.

114
00:11:45,814 --> 00:11:47,645
Thanks, Max.

115
00:11:48,014 --> 00:11:49,493
Go get 'em.

116
00:12:17,854 --> 00:12:19,333
Hey.

117
00:12:25,654 --> 00:12:27,167
I don't know,

118
00:12:27,374 --> 00:12:29,888
in case you ever wanna investigate

119
00:12:30,094 --> 00:12:33,006
a Fortune 500 company or...

120
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,365
...argue cab routes.

121
00:13:39,654 --> 00:13:40,882
Hey.

122
00:13:44,894 --> 00:13:48,125
Oh, whoa, whoa. Hey, yeah.
Come on, man, I'm sorry.

123
00:13:48,334 --> 00:13:51,644
I didn't hear you, man.
Come on. I'll take you.

124
00:13:57,014 --> 00:14:00,006
- Where to?
- 1039 South Union Street.

125
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,727
Gotcha.

126
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,089
- How long you think this'll take?
- Seven minutes.

127
00:14:19,574 --> 00:14:22,213
Seven. Not eight? Not six?

128
00:14:23,134 --> 00:14:24,931
Two minutes to get across the 110
to Normandie.

129
00:14:25,134 --> 00:14:26,453
Normandie to Venice, three minutes.

130
00:14:26,654 --> 00:14:28,770
Over to Union is one.
Plus one for "shit happens."

131
00:14:28,974 --> 00:14:30,726
- Okay if I time you?
- Knock yourself out.

132
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:32,686
What do I get if you're wrong?
A free ride?

133
00:14:32,894 --> 00:14:35,408
You get an apology.
I already offered my free ride today.

134
00:14:35,614 --> 00:14:38,048
- To who?
- Some girl.

135
00:14:38,574 --> 00:14:40,371
Did you get a date with her?

136
00:14:41,574 --> 00:14:44,407
- First time in L.A.?
- No.

137
00:14:44,614 --> 00:14:48,129
Tell you the truth, whenever I'm here
I can't wait to leave.

138
00:14:48,774 --> 00:14:51,004
Too sprawled out, disconnected.
You know.

139
00:14:51,214 --> 00:14:53,933
- That's me. You like it?
- It's my home.

140
00:14:54,134 --> 00:14:55,772
Seventeen million people.
This was a country,

141
00:14:55,974 --> 00:14:59,489
it'd be the fifth biggest economy in the
world, and nobody knows each other.

142
00:14:59,734 --> 00:15:02,771
I read about this guy,
gets on the MTA here, dies.

143
00:15:04,214 --> 00:15:07,490
Six hours he's riding the subway
before anybody notices his corpse

144
00:15:07,694 --> 00:15:11,164
doing laps around L.A.,
people on and off sitting next to him.

145
00:15:11,694 --> 00:15:13,571
Nobody notices.

146
00:15:18,174 --> 00:15:20,404
This is the cleanest cab
I've ever been in.

147
00:15:20,734 --> 00:15:24,010
- Regular ride?
- Yeah, I share it with the day-shift guy.

148
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,728
- Because you prefer nights?
- Yeah, people are more relaxed.

149
00:15:26,934 --> 00:15:29,004
Less stress, less traffic, better tips.

150
00:15:29,214 --> 00:15:32,047
- How are the benefits?
- Oh, no. It's not that kind of job.

151
00:15:33,094 --> 00:15:35,608
I'm not in this for the long haul.
I'm just filling in, you know.

152
00:15:35,814 --> 00:15:38,009
Just temporary while I'm getting
some things shaped up.

153
00:15:38,214 --> 00:15:39,329
This is just temporary.

154
00:15:39,534 --> 00:15:41,570
- How long you been driving?
- Twelve years.

155
00:15:42,094 --> 00:15:43,493
Really?

156
00:15:44,494 --> 00:15:46,644
What other things
you putting together?

157
00:15:52,014 --> 00:15:56,007
You know, I don't wanna talk about it.
Just a little business plan.

158
00:15:56,214 --> 00:15:59,411
- No offense. I just...
- None taken.

159
00:15:59,614 --> 00:16:04,130
You're one of these guys that do
instead of talk. That's cool.

160
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:15,332
- Seven minutes. Man, you're good.
- I got lucky with the lights.

161
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:18,844
Yeah, sure. You probably know
the light schedules too.

162
00:16:19,214 --> 00:16:23,173
Listen, I'm in town on
a real-estate deal, close in one night.

163
00:16:23,374 --> 00:16:26,446
I got five stops to make.
Collect signatures, see some friends,

164
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:29,851
and then I got a 6 a.m. Out of LAX.
Why don't you hang with me.

165
00:16:30,054 --> 00:16:32,124
The car's not for hire, man.
That's against regs.

166
00:16:32,334 --> 00:16:34,290
- Regulations?
- Yeah.

167
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,770
These guys don't pay you sick leave.
How much you pull down a shift?

168
00:16:38,254 --> 00:16:40,210
- How much?
- 350, 400.

169
00:16:40,414 --> 00:16:43,292
Yeah? Well, let me tell you what.
I'll make it 600.

170
00:16:45,654 --> 00:16:47,246
- Man, I don't know.
- Plus an extra hundred

171
00:16:47,454 --> 00:16:49,570
you get me to LAX
and I don't have to run for the plane.

172
00:16:49,774 --> 00:16:51,093
Oh, no, guy.
I don't know about this.

173
00:16:51,294 --> 00:16:52,409
- I don't know.
- Yeah, you do.

174
00:16:52,614 --> 00:16:54,570
- Man, I don't know, man.
- Yeah, you do.

175
00:16:54,774 --> 00:16:56,207
Six hundred...

176
00:16:56,414 --> 00:16:58,530
Cool. We got a deal.
Now, here's 300 down.

177
00:16:58,734 --> 00:17:00,167
- What's your name?
- Max.

178
00:17:00,374 --> 00:17:03,810
- Max. I'm Vincent.
- All right.

179
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,173
I can't stay double-parked here,
though.

180
00:17:09,374 --> 00:17:11,808
I'll meet you in the alley
behind the building here.

181
00:17:27,734 --> 00:17:30,009
Definitely not from around here.

182
00:17:48,494 --> 00:17:50,212
There you go.

183
00:18:27,854 --> 00:18:30,209
Oh, no! Shit! Fuck!

184
00:18:34,894 --> 00:18:35,963
What the f...?

185
00:18:36,214 --> 00:18:39,650
What the hell?! Damn it!

186
00:18:39,934 --> 00:18:41,686
My man, you all right?

187
00:18:41,894 --> 00:18:44,647
Oh, shit. Fuck.

188
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:52,086
He... He fell on the cab.

189
00:18:52,614 --> 00:18:54,923
He fell... He fell from up there
on the motherfucking cab.

190
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:58,965
- Shit. I think he's dead.
- Good guess.

191
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,088
You killed him?

192
00:19:07,654 --> 00:19:10,851
No, I shot him.
Bullets and the fall killed him.

193
00:19:12,614 --> 00:19:14,764
Oh, man. Fuck this, man.

194
00:19:14,974 --> 00:19:17,044
- Red light, Max.
- Hold on. Hold on.

195
00:19:18,374 --> 00:19:20,763
Put your hands down.
Put your hands down.

196
00:19:20,974 --> 00:19:22,043
Okay. Okay.

197
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:28,369
- Okay, help me out. Pop the trunk.
- What?

198
00:19:28,654 --> 00:19:30,804
Pop the trunk.

199
00:19:31,934 --> 00:19:35,643
Come on, man. Come on. Come on.
What you...? What you doing?

200
00:19:35,854 --> 00:19:38,687
I'm gonna roll him off the roof.
Can't leave him here.

201
00:19:38,894 --> 00:19:41,931
So unless you want him up front
with you... But given the hygiene...

202
00:19:42,134 --> 00:19:43,692
- Oh, shit.
- Okay.

203
00:19:43,894 --> 00:19:47,170
It's only a dead guy. Grab his hands.

204
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,445
- I can't do this.
- Grab his wrists.

205
00:19:54,574 --> 00:19:57,327
- You got it?
- Yeah. He's twitching and shit.

206
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,370
Okay. That's good enough.

207
00:20:20,694 --> 00:20:23,492
- Let's go.
- Hey, why don't you just take the cab.

208
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:25,372
- Take the cab?
- Yeah, you take it.

209
00:20:25,854 --> 00:20:28,846
I'll chill. I'll just chill.
They don't even know who's driving

210
00:20:29,054 --> 00:20:31,727
these things half the time anyway,
man. They never check or anything.

211
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:34,402
Okay? So just take it. You, me...

212
00:20:34,894 --> 00:20:36,293
You promise not
to tell anybody, right?

213
00:20:36,494 --> 00:20:37,847
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Right?

214
00:20:39,214 --> 00:20:40,886
Promise.

215
00:20:41,094 --> 00:20:43,005
- Get in the fucking car.
- You... You...

216
00:20:43,214 --> 00:20:45,011
Get in the car.

217
00:21:57,814 --> 00:21:59,486
Ramone?

218
00:22:05,774 --> 00:22:07,287
Ramone?

219
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,806
Ramone!

220
00:22:34,014 --> 00:22:35,413
Ramone!

221
00:22:57,734 --> 00:22:59,326
Fuck.

222
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:11,646
- Rampart watch commander.
- This is Detective Fanning, Narcotics.

223
00:23:11,854 --> 00:23:15,927
Send two black-and-whites and
a night detective to 1039 South Union.

224
00:23:16,134 --> 00:23:20,924
- And contact SID. I got a crime scene.
- Roger. 1039 South Union.

225
00:23:32,054 --> 00:23:34,443
- What are you doing?
- I got to clean it up. It's a mess.

226
00:23:34,654 --> 00:23:37,726
So? Lady Macbeth, we're sitting here,
and the light's green.

227
00:23:37,934 --> 00:23:39,413
Leave the seats.

228
00:23:43,974 --> 00:23:45,726
Asshole!

229
00:23:47,734 --> 00:23:49,565
You no longer have
the cleanest cab in La-La Land.

230
00:23:49,774 --> 00:23:52,925
You gotta live with that.
You focus on the job. Drive.

231
00:23:55,654 --> 00:23:59,442
- 7565 Fountain. You know it?
- West Hollywood.

232
00:23:59,654 --> 00:24:02,373
- How long you figure?
- I don't know, man, 17 minutes.

233
00:24:04,654 --> 00:24:05,973
Why?

234
00:24:06,454 --> 00:24:08,888
- Oh, no. No, no, no. Hold on, man.
- Now, I told you we had

235
00:24:09,094 --> 00:24:10,766
- other stops to make tonight.
- No, you said

236
00:24:10,974 --> 00:24:13,852
- you had to go visit some friends.
- Well, they're somebody's friends.

237
00:24:14,054 --> 00:24:18,809
You drive a cab, I make my rounds,
you might make it through the night,

238
00:24:19,014 --> 00:24:20,606
come out 700 bucks ahead.

239
00:24:20,814 --> 00:24:22,884
I'm not trying to piss you off,
but I can't do this.

240
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:25,085
I can't drive you while
you go around killing people.

241
00:24:25,294 --> 00:24:27,649
- It ain't my job.
- Tonight it is.

242
00:24:28,294 --> 00:24:31,730
Look, you don't get it.
I mean it. I mean it.

243
00:24:31,934 --> 00:24:34,892
I'm... I'm not up for this.

244
00:24:35,094 --> 00:24:37,050
- Okay, hey, hey, hey. You're stressed.
- Yes, I am.

245
00:24:37,254 --> 00:24:39,324
You're stressed.
Now, I understand that.

246
00:24:39,534 --> 00:24:43,163
Now, you just keep breathing
and stay calm.

247
00:24:43,534 --> 00:24:44,649
- Are you breathing?
- Shit.

248
00:24:44,854 --> 00:24:45,764
- Are you breathing?
- Yes.

249
00:24:45,974 --> 00:24:47,168
Okay, good.

250
00:24:52,094 --> 00:24:53,413
Okay, look, here's the deal:

251
00:24:53,614 --> 00:24:56,128
Man, you were gonna drive me
around tonight and never be the wiser,

252
00:24:56,334 --> 00:24:59,929
but el gordo got in front of a window,
did his high dive.

253
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:03,366
We're into plan B.
You still breathing?

254
00:25:03,814 --> 00:25:06,612
Now, we gotta make the best of it.
Improvise. Adapt to the environment.

255
00:25:06,814 --> 00:25:10,284
Darwin. Shit happens. I Ching.
Whatever, man. We gotta roll with it.

256
00:25:10,494 --> 00:25:11,847
"I Ching"?
What are you talking about?

257
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:15,649
- You threw a man out of a window.
- I didn't throw him. He fell.

258
00:25:15,854 --> 00:25:19,244
- Well, what did he do to you?
- What?

259
00:25:19,454 --> 00:25:22,844
- What did he do to you?
- Nothing. I only met him tonight.

260
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:25,568
You just met him once,
and you kill him like that?

261
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,924
What, I should only kill people
after I get to know them?

262
00:25:28,134 --> 00:25:31,012
- No, man.
- Max, 6 billion people on the planet,

263
00:25:31,214 --> 00:25:33,284
you're getting bent out of shape
because of one fat guy.

264
00:25:33,494 --> 00:25:36,406
- Well, who was he?
- What do you care?

265
00:25:36,614 --> 00:25:39,003
- Have you ever heard of Rwanda?
- Yes, I know Rwanda.

266
00:25:39,214 --> 00:25:41,250
Tens of thousands killed
before sundown.

267
00:25:41,454 --> 00:25:44,446
Nobody's killed people that fast
since Nagasaki and Hiroshima.

268
00:25:44,654 --> 00:25:46,053
- Did you bat an eye, Max?
- What?

269
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:48,973
Did you join Amnesty International,
Oxfam,

270
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:51,688
"Save the whale,"
Greenpeace or something? No.

271
00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:54,494
I off one fat Angeleno,
and you throw a hissy fit.

272
00:25:54,694 --> 00:25:56,127
Man, I don't know any Rwandans.

273
00:25:56,334 --> 00:25:58,450
You don't know the guy
in the trunk either.

274
00:25:58,654 --> 00:25:59,928
Man.

275
00:26:01,574 --> 00:26:03,769
Okay, if it makes you feel any better,
he was a criminal

276
00:26:03,974 --> 00:26:06,010
involved in a continuing
criminal enterprise.

277
00:26:06,534 --> 00:26:08,490
What are you doing?
You just taking out the garbage?

278
00:26:08,694 --> 00:26:10,173
Yeah. Something like that.

279
00:26:10,574 --> 00:26:13,088
- Pull over to the right.
- Shit.

280
00:26:15,094 --> 00:26:17,050
- Get rid of them.
- How?

281
00:26:17,254 --> 00:26:20,405
You're a cabby.
Talk yourself out of a ticket.

282
00:26:24,774 --> 00:26:26,127
Just, please, man, don't do anything.

283
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:29,212
Then don't let me get cornered.
You don't have the trunk space.

284
00:26:29,414 --> 00:26:31,006
- I can't believe this.
- Believe it.

285
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,772
Don't. I'll talk to them.

286
00:26:36,454 --> 00:26:38,206
He's probably married.

287
00:26:38,934 --> 00:26:42,483
The other one has kids.
Probably his wife's pregnant.

288
00:26:42,694 --> 00:26:46,687
Yeah, I'll take care of it. I got it.
I'll deal with it. Yeah. Just a second.

289
00:26:48,334 --> 00:26:51,326
How you doing? My partner's gonna
help you out on that side over there.

290
00:26:51,534 --> 00:26:53,570
License, registration.

291
00:26:53,934 --> 00:26:55,208
Yeah.

292
00:26:58,574 --> 00:27:01,725
I'm pulling you over
because your windshield's smashed.

293
00:27:03,614 --> 00:27:05,411
- All this current?
- Yes, officer.

294
00:27:07,534 --> 00:27:09,172
Hey, what'd you do,
have a food fight in here?

295
00:27:09,374 --> 00:27:11,251
Yeah, I'II... Pretty messy.

296
00:27:11,454 --> 00:27:13,570
Just clean it up...

297
00:27:14,574 --> 00:27:17,088
Hey, is this blood up here
on your windshield?

298
00:27:17,854 --> 00:27:19,173
Yeah.

299
00:27:19,894 --> 00:27:22,806
Yeah, I hit a deer.

300
00:27:23,014 --> 00:27:26,051
- You hit a deer?
- Yeah, over on...

301
00:27:27,014 --> 00:27:30,245
- I was on Slauson.
- A South Central deer?

302
00:27:31,574 --> 00:27:32,848
Yeah, they out there. They...

303
00:27:33,054 --> 00:27:35,773
It ran right in front of the car,
and I couldn't avoid it.

304
00:27:35,974 --> 00:27:40,013
- Why you still carrying a passenger?
- I was on my way to the depot, and...

305
00:27:40,214 --> 00:27:42,205
I could just drop him.
His drop is on my way.

306
00:27:42,414 --> 00:27:45,212
Yeah, but your cab's unsafe to drive,
and we have to impound it,

307
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:47,769
so we gotta do a vehicle inventory
before the tow truck gets here.

308
00:27:47,974 --> 00:27:49,692
So pop the trunk
and step out the vehicle.

309
00:27:49,894 --> 00:27:52,203
Sir, I'm sorry, but you're gonna
have to call another cab.

310
00:27:52,414 --> 00:27:55,008
Is that really necessary, officer?
I'm just a half a mile from here.

311
00:27:55,214 --> 00:27:57,409
Yes, sir, I'm afraid it is.
Please, step out the vehicle.

312
00:27:57,614 --> 00:28:00,287
- You too. Come on.
- If you open that trunk, they go inside.

313
00:28:00,494 --> 00:28:02,849
You know what, man,
it's been a long night.

314
00:28:03,694 --> 00:28:05,685
Plus, the barn is right up there,
you know.

315
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:08,044
Just give me a break.
This is my first fare.

316
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:11,007
Get out the cab. Open the trunk.
Come on.

317
00:28:13,174 --> 00:28:15,847
Step out. You too, sir. Please.

318
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:21,210
This is Rampart Division dispatch.
Shots fired at 83rd and Hoover.

319
00:28:21,614 --> 00:28:23,969
All available Precinct 26
units respond. Over.

320
00:28:24,174 --> 00:28:26,688
Hey, partner, we gotta roll.
Roger. En route.

321
00:28:26,894 --> 00:28:29,010
Go straight to the garage.
Have a nice night, sir.

322
00:28:50,934 --> 00:28:52,572
Stop here.

323
00:29:17,334 --> 00:29:18,847
Hands on the wheel, 10 and 2.

324
00:29:19,054 --> 00:29:21,693
- Why?
- Because I say so.

325
00:29:31,974 --> 00:29:33,168
- Max. Max.
- Shit.

326
00:29:33,374 --> 00:29:35,490
You out there, you son of a bitch?

327
00:29:37,134 --> 00:29:40,604
- Who is that?
- That's Lenny. Just dispatch.

328
00:29:42,894 --> 00:29:45,124
Max, I know you're out there.
Answer the goddamn call.

329
00:29:45,334 --> 00:29:47,848
- What happens if you don't?
- He just keeps calling me.

330
00:29:48,054 --> 00:29:49,965
Max, answer.

331
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:56,486
Don't blow it.

332
00:29:58,774 --> 00:30:01,607
- Yeah, Lenny, what's up? It's me.
- Just got off the phone with the cops.

333
00:30:01,814 --> 00:30:04,726
Desk sergeant called to check
you brought the cab in.

334
00:30:05,454 --> 00:30:08,173
- Yeah, so?
- So aside from I hate talking to cops,

335
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:10,649
they tell me you crashed
the goddamn cab?

336
00:30:10,854 --> 00:30:13,926
No. No, I got crashed into.
I didn't...

337
00:30:14,134 --> 00:30:17,285
Do I care what, where or why?
You're paying.

338
00:30:23,334 --> 00:30:25,723
It was an accident. You're not liable.

339
00:30:25,934 --> 00:30:29,404
- It was an accident. I'm not liable.
- Bullshit. I'm making you liable.

340
00:30:29,614 --> 00:30:31,127
It's coming out
of your goddamn pocket.

341
00:30:31,334 --> 00:30:33,006
You tell him to stick this cab
up his fat ass.

342
00:30:33,214 --> 00:30:35,284
- I can't do that. That's my boss.
- So?

343
00:30:35,494 --> 00:30:37,962
- I need my job.
- No, you don't.

344
00:30:38,974 --> 00:30:41,363
You still there? I'm talking to you.
Max! Max!

345
00:30:41,574 --> 00:30:45,089
- He's not paying you a damn thing.
- Who the hell is this?

346
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:51,132
Albert Riccardo,
assistant U.S. Attorney,

347
00:30:51,334 --> 00:30:53,723
a passenger in this cab,
and I'm reporting you to the DMV.

348
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:55,845
- Let's not get excited.
- Not get excited?

349
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:57,407
How am I supposed to
not get excited,

350
00:30:57,614 --> 00:30:59,286
listening to you
try to extort a working man?

351
00:30:59,494 --> 00:31:01,132
You know goddamn well
your collision policy

352
00:31:01,334 --> 00:31:03,643
and general-liability umbrella
will cover the damages.

353
00:31:03,854 --> 00:31:06,163
Now, what are you trying to pull,
you sarcastic prick?

354
00:31:06,374 --> 00:31:08,012
- I was just trying to...
- Tell it to him.

355
00:31:08,214 --> 00:31:10,887
Here, tell him he's an asshole.
Go ahead.

356
00:31:11,094 --> 00:31:12,766
You're an asshole.

357
00:31:13,054 --> 00:31:14,567
Tell him he pulls this shit again,

358
00:31:14,774 --> 00:31:17,607
you're gonna stick
this Yellow Cab up his fat ass.

359
00:31:19,214 --> 00:31:21,364
And next time you pull any shit,

360
00:31:21,574 --> 00:31:26,045
I'm... I'm gonna have to stick
this Yellow Cab up your fat ass.

361
00:31:40,974 --> 00:31:42,202
Shit!

362
00:31:42,414 --> 00:31:45,247
Things like protective orders,
because you think of domestic stalking

363
00:31:45,454 --> 00:31:48,446
where a husband wants his wife back
or boyfriend-girlfriend kind of thing.

364
00:31:48,654 --> 00:31:50,849
We always hear,
"Get your protective order."

365
00:31:51,054 --> 00:31:53,204
Well, a protective order's
a tool that we use,

366
00:31:53,414 --> 00:31:56,645
but oftentimes, it's just
a piece of paper to the stalker.

367
00:31:56,854 --> 00:31:57,923
- Yeah.
- Mr. Clarke,

368
00:31:58,134 --> 00:31:59,487
there's a notary here to see you.

369
00:31:59,694 --> 00:32:01,173
Well, did he identify himself
as a notary?

370
00:32:01,374 --> 00:32:02,887
Yes, he did.

371
00:32:03,094 --> 00:32:05,085
All right, sure, send him up.

372
00:32:05,294 --> 00:32:08,127
Or shoots them, you know?
That happens all too often.

373
00:32:08,334 --> 00:32:10,529
- But we use it as a tool.
- Yeah, a lot of times, though...

374
00:32:10,734 --> 00:32:14,249
I say a lot of times... In this situation,
strangers may write or call.

375
00:32:14,454 --> 00:32:17,605
But how often, in fact, are stalkers

376
00:32:17,814 --> 00:32:21,727
people that the recipient
of those affections knows?

377
00:32:31,774 --> 00:32:34,686
Hey! Hey, I'm in the cab!

378
00:32:34,894 --> 00:32:36,452
Hey!

379
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:40,087
Shit. Down here in the... In the alley!

380
00:32:41,094 --> 00:32:42,527
Shit!

381
00:32:49,014 --> 00:32:50,606
Hey, hold up.

382
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:59,363
Oh, man, yeah.
Hey, yeah, right there.

383
00:32:59,574 --> 00:33:03,249
I'm in the cab, man, I'm stuck.
Thank you. Thank you.

384
00:33:04,334 --> 00:33:07,246
Hey, man. Hey, look,
I gotta get out of here.

385
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,685
- What's up, man? What's going on?
- I'm tied up in here.

386
00:33:09,894 --> 00:33:11,532
This guy tied me up,
but he's in this building...

387
00:33:11,734 --> 00:33:14,123
...wreaking havoc, doing wild shit.
I need to get out of here.

388
00:33:14,334 --> 00:33:17,246
- You all tied up in there, huh?
- Get me out so we can call the cops.

389
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:19,172
Why don't you give me
your fucking wallet.

390
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:22,730
- Are you kidding me?
- Do I look like I'm kidding you?!

391
00:33:23,214 --> 00:33:26,445
Listen, don't you see that my hands
are tied to the steering wheel?!

392
00:33:26,894 --> 00:33:30,204
I don't give a... what they're tied to.
I'll fuck you up.

393
00:33:30,414 --> 00:33:32,848
- Don't shoot, man.
- Then get your ass up.

394
00:33:33,214 --> 00:33:34,283
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

395
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,450
Fuck else you got in here? Jackpot.

396
00:33:41,214 --> 00:33:42,727
That was for real.

397
00:33:50,974 --> 00:33:52,453
Yo, homey.

398
00:33:55,334 --> 00:33:57,245
- That my briefcase?
- This your briefcase?

399
00:33:57,454 --> 00:33:59,490
Yeah, it is. Why, you want it back?

400
00:34:00,014 --> 00:34:01,732
How about your wallet?

401
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,365
What else you got for me, huh?

402
00:34:09,974 --> 00:34:11,009
Fuck!

403
00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:29,894
Where's the button?
Under the dash?

404
00:34:35,534 --> 00:34:37,126
Mind getting it?

405
00:34:48,774 --> 00:34:52,084
You attract attention, you're gonna get
people killed who didn't need to be.

406
00:34:52,534 --> 00:34:54,013
You understand?

407
00:34:54,214 --> 00:34:56,011
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

408
00:35:03,574 --> 00:35:08,250
But, hey, new news:
We're ahead of schedule.

409
00:35:08,654 --> 00:35:11,487
- Like jazz?
- Sorry, what?

410
00:35:11,694 --> 00:35:14,766
- Jazz. You like jazz?
- Not that much.

411
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,003
Guy told me about this place
off Crenshaw.

412
00:35:19,214 --> 00:35:21,682
Leimert Park.
All the West Coast greats played there.

413
00:35:21,894 --> 00:35:26,570
Dexter Gordon, Charlie Mingus,
Chet Baker. Like that.

414
00:35:27,534 --> 00:35:30,332
Come on, finish up. Buy you a drink.

415
00:35:40,934 --> 00:35:43,129
This informant of yours,
what's his name? Ramone?

416
00:35:43,334 --> 00:35:46,371
Ramone Ayala. Supposed to meet him
in Bellflower last night.

417
00:35:46,574 --> 00:35:49,088
He doesn't show up,
I roll here, find this.

418
00:35:49,294 --> 00:35:51,524
Yeah, how long
you been working this guy?

419
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:53,531
Four months. He's a low-level player.

420
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:56,612
Part of a distribution network
that hooks up to Felix.

421
00:35:56,814 --> 00:35:58,042
Felix Reyes-Torrena?

422
00:35:58,654 --> 00:36:01,009
Feds are all over him.
They don't want us anywhere near it.

423
00:36:01,214 --> 00:36:03,364
Since when's L.A.P.D. Working
for the Feeb?

424
00:36:03,574 --> 00:36:05,724
If they're into it,
they're just gonna take all our stuff,

425
00:36:05,934 --> 00:36:08,209
build their case, take all the credit.
So, what is the point?

426
00:36:08,414 --> 00:36:10,245
The point is, is my guy
flew out a window.

427
00:36:10,454 --> 00:36:12,012
So if my CI flies out a window,

428
00:36:16,334 --> 00:36:20,850
Is there a crime here? A homicide?
You got a body?

429
00:36:21,454 --> 00:36:23,684
- I just see a bunch of broken glass.
- And blood.

430
00:36:23,894 --> 00:36:26,886
Down here, in the glass.
Here's some more.

431
00:36:27,094 --> 00:36:30,370
And there's some spatter patterns
over there and over here.

432
00:36:31,014 --> 00:36:33,733
- Richard?
- Yeah, it's me.

433
00:36:39,494 --> 00:36:41,849
Ramone went through that window,

434
00:36:42,054 --> 00:36:43,328
splat.

435
00:36:44,614 --> 00:36:47,811
Glass here, then tires rolled over it.

436
00:36:48,014 --> 00:36:49,686
- Maybe he jumped.
- Sure.

437
00:36:49,894 --> 00:36:52,931
He's depressed, so he jumps four
stories out of a window onto his head.

438
00:36:53,134 --> 00:36:55,011
"Wow, that feels better."
Picks himself up.

439
00:36:55,214 --> 00:36:57,409
"Now I think I'll go on
with the rest of my day."

440
00:36:58,814 --> 00:37:01,931
- Come on, man.
- Hey, Ray! Catch.

441
00:37:05,454 --> 00:37:08,730
- Recent?
- You can still smell the cordite.

442
00:37:09,734 --> 00:37:11,611
Old guy across the alley
watching late-night TV

443
00:37:11,814 --> 00:37:13,850
says he saw a cab parked here
earlier tonight

444
00:37:14,054 --> 00:37:16,124
with two guys
walking around the hood.

445
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:17,892
Description? He see anything?

446
00:37:18,094 --> 00:37:20,767
Kind of saw.
Guy's got glasses like Coke bottles.

447
00:37:20,974 --> 00:37:23,249
There are 4,000 taxicabs
in L.A. County.

448
00:37:23,454 --> 00:37:25,410
- You got anything else?
- That's it.

449
00:37:25,614 --> 00:37:28,970
Okay. Keep knocking.
Let's keep knocking.

450
00:37:29,174 --> 00:37:31,483
Remember that
Bay Area deal? Oakland?

451
00:37:31,694 --> 00:37:32,843
Cabby drove around all night,

452
00:37:33,054 --> 00:37:35,363
killed three people,
then put the gun to his head.

453
00:37:35,574 --> 00:37:36,609
The guy flipped out. So what?

454
00:37:36,814 --> 00:37:39,123
So that Oakland PD detective,
what's-his-name, never bought it.

455
00:37:39,334 --> 00:37:42,087
Cabby had no criminal record,
no history of mental illness.

456
00:37:42,654 --> 00:37:44,645
Pops three people, then himself?

457
00:37:46,174 --> 00:37:50,053
Anyway, that detective always thought
there was someone else in that cab.

458
00:38:20,414 --> 00:38:22,848
I never learned to listen to jazz.

459
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:27,803
It's off melody. Behind the notes.
Not what's expected.

460
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:31,290
- Improvising, like tonight.
- Like tonight?

461
00:38:54,774 --> 00:38:56,685
Most people, ten years from now,

462
00:38:56,894 --> 00:38:59,203
same job, same place, same routine.
Everything the same.

463
00:38:59,414 --> 00:39:01,882
Just keeping it safe
over and over and over.

464
00:39:02,094 --> 00:39:03,732
Ten years from now.

465
00:39:04,214 --> 00:39:08,002
Man, you don't know where you'll be
ten minutes from now.

466
00:39:08,694 --> 00:39:09,968
Do you?

467
00:39:24,374 --> 00:39:28,162
- Who is that on the trumpet?
- That's Daniel, baby, he's the owner.

468
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:33,890
He's terrific. Would you be so kind
as to invite him over after his set?

469
00:39:34,094 --> 00:39:37,530
- I gotta buy him a drink.
- Sure thing, darling.

470
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:47,883
No, now, see, I was about 19,
bussing tables right here.

471
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,688
The money wasn't shit,
but that wasn't the point.

472
00:39:50,894 --> 00:39:53,613
It was about being around the music.
And I was.

473
00:39:53,814 --> 00:39:55,167
I mean, take this one night.

474
00:39:55,374 --> 00:39:58,366
July 22nd, 1964. Who you think
walks through that door?

475
00:39:58,574 --> 00:40:00,007
Bye, baby.

476
00:40:00,214 --> 00:40:02,284
Miles Davis. That's right.

477
00:40:02,494 --> 00:40:03,722
- In the flesh?
- That's right.

478
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:07,006
I'm talking about, through those doors,
the coolest man on the planet.

479
00:40:07,214 --> 00:40:08,283
Jesus.

480
00:40:08,494 --> 00:40:10,849
Anyway, he had been
at a recording session

481
00:40:11,054 --> 00:40:14,683
up at Columbia, up on Vine.
So Miles comes through that door.

482
00:40:14,894 --> 00:40:18,853
Before you know it, he's up on
the bandstand, jamming with the band.

483
00:40:19,374 --> 00:40:21,842
- I mean, it had to be...
- Oh, it was scary.

484
00:40:22,054 --> 00:40:24,443
I mean, the dude was
so focused, man.

485
00:40:24,654 --> 00:40:26,849
Plus, he was kind of
a scary cat anyway, man.

486
00:40:27,054 --> 00:40:28,453
I mean, everybody
and their mama knew

487
00:40:28,654 --> 00:40:31,293
that you don't just come up
and talk to Miles Davis.

488
00:40:31,494 --> 00:40:35,646
I mean, he may have looked like he
was chilling, but he was absorbed.

489
00:40:35,854 --> 00:40:39,767
This one young, hip couple, one of
them tried to shake his hand one day.

490
00:40:39,974 --> 00:40:42,727
And the guy says, "Hi, my name is..."

491
00:40:42,934 --> 00:40:45,528
Miles said, "Get the fuck out
of my face, you jive motherfucker.

492
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,531
Take your silly bitch with you."

493
00:40:49,134 --> 00:40:51,489
You know? That's...
That was Miles, man.

494
00:40:51,694 --> 00:40:55,767
That's the way he was when he was
in his musical headspace. Fierce.

495
00:40:56,094 --> 00:40:57,527
But did you get to talk to him?

496
00:40:57,734 --> 00:40:58,883
- Better than that.
- No.

497
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:02,969
- I played for about 20 minutes.
- Unbelievable.

498
00:41:03,174 --> 00:41:04,687
- How'd you do?
- How'd I do?

499
00:41:04,894 --> 00:41:07,533
Well, you really ain't shit when
you're playing next to Miles Davis.

500
00:41:07,734 --> 00:41:09,725
But he carried my ass.

501
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:13,449
- What'd he say?
- He said one word, "Cool."

502
00:41:13,774 --> 00:41:14,923
- "Cool"?
- Yeah.

503
00:41:15,134 --> 00:41:16,453
- That's it?
- Yeah.

504
00:41:16,654 --> 00:41:18,849
That meant, "Good, but not ready."

505
00:41:19,054 --> 00:41:21,363
It meant,
"Look me up when you are."

506
00:41:21,894 --> 00:41:24,362
- Did you?
- No.

507
00:41:24,574 --> 00:41:27,691
I got drafted and got
into some other things.

508
00:41:27,894 --> 00:41:32,684
And by the time I got back to music,
the season had passed.

509
00:41:33,174 --> 00:41:35,813
But, you know, I was born in 1945,

510
00:41:36,014 --> 00:41:39,484
but that night was
the moment of my conception.

511
00:41:39,694 --> 00:41:42,811
- Right here in this room.
- Crowd's not here now.

512
00:41:43,014 --> 00:41:46,051
Well, jazz ain't the draw
that it used to be.

513
00:41:47,614 --> 00:41:49,411
What a great story.

514
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:54,650
I gotta tell the people in Culiacán
and Cartagena that story.

515
00:42:06,574 --> 00:42:09,566
You know the folks in Culiacán
and Cartagena?

516
00:42:09,774 --> 00:42:11,366
Afraid so.

517
00:42:12,814 --> 00:42:15,123
Man, just when I thought
you were a cool guy.

518
00:42:15,334 --> 00:42:18,451
I am a cool guy,
with a job I contracted to do.

519
00:42:18,654 --> 00:42:20,929
Come on, Vincent,
give the dude a pass.

520
00:42:21,134 --> 00:42:22,886
- I'm working here.
- Listen. You the one

521
00:42:23,094 --> 00:42:25,892
talking about improvisation. You like
the guy, you like how he plays.

522
00:42:26,094 --> 00:42:28,369
- Let's just play a little jazz. Come on.
- Improvi...

523
00:42:28,574 --> 00:42:30,212
That's funny, coming from you.

524
00:42:36,334 --> 00:42:38,723
How's this? I'll ask a question.

525
00:42:38,934 --> 00:42:42,131
- What question?
- A jazz question.

526
00:42:42,334 --> 00:42:45,406
Now, you get it right, we roll.

527
00:42:46,054 --> 00:42:48,124
You disappear tonight.

528
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:50,406
If I walk out of here tonight,

529
00:42:50,614 --> 00:42:54,209
I will go so far away,
it'll be just like I was dead.

530
00:42:54,414 --> 00:42:55,642
And one more thing:

531
00:42:55,854 --> 00:42:59,244
These people
and their rep here, Felix.

532
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:01,763
Well, you tell them I'm sorry.

533
00:43:01,974 --> 00:43:06,331
You tell them I had to.
They laid a grant of immunity on me.

534
00:43:06,534 --> 00:43:10,368
I was compelled. It was either
play ball or go back inside.

535
00:43:10,574 --> 00:43:13,168
And I'm not going back inside.

536
00:43:15,574 --> 00:43:16,768
Yeah.

537
00:43:19,854 --> 00:43:21,446
Lay it on me.

538
00:43:22,534 --> 00:43:24,047
Where did Miles learn music?

539
00:43:24,334 --> 00:43:26,052
I know everything there is
to know about Miles.

540
00:43:26,254 --> 00:43:27,482
Then let's have it.

541
00:43:27,694 --> 00:43:30,686
Music school.
He got into music school, right?

542
00:43:30,894 --> 00:43:33,328
His father was a dentist,
East St. Louis.

543
00:43:33,534 --> 00:43:35,286
Invested in agriculture,
made plenty of money.

544
00:43:35,494 --> 00:43:38,645
He sent Miles
to Juilliard School of Music,

545
00:43:38,854 --> 00:43:40,924
New York, 1945.

546
00:43:41,134 --> 00:43:42,249
Man.

547
00:43:56,334 --> 00:43:58,086
Dropped out of Juilliard
after less than a year.

548
00:43:58,294 --> 00:44:00,330
Tracked down Charlie Parker
on 52nd Street,

549
00:44:00,534 --> 00:44:02,525
who mentored him
for the next three years.

550
00:44:24,934 --> 00:44:27,926
- Hey.
- No. No, I'm done.

551
00:44:28,134 --> 00:44:29,965
- Find you another cab.
- Max.

552
00:44:30,174 --> 00:44:32,688
Leave me alone.
I'm collateral anyway.

553
00:44:39,294 --> 00:44:41,250
I am not playing.

554
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:45,450
You played him, man.

555
00:44:46,574 --> 00:44:50,852
He got the answer right,
would you have let him go?

556
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,493
This is 102. This is 102. Max?

557
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,845
- What is it with this guy?
- Max?

558
00:45:09,054 --> 00:45:11,648
- You hassling my driver again?
- Who are you?

559
00:45:11,854 --> 00:45:14,084
The same guy
you talked to last time.

560
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:17,525
Max's mother's driving me crazy.
Put him on the line, please.

561
00:45:17,734 --> 00:45:19,008
Hang on.

562
00:45:20,094 --> 00:45:21,243
Carefully.

563
00:45:24,014 --> 00:45:25,129
- Yeah.
- Your mother's calling

564
00:45:25,334 --> 00:45:26,813
every ten minutes.
Why didn't you show?

565
00:45:27,014 --> 00:45:28,447
Are you all right?
Where are you?

566
00:45:28,654 --> 00:45:30,133
Show for what?

567
00:45:31,494 --> 00:45:33,132
Tell her I can't make it tonight.

568
00:45:33,334 --> 00:45:35,484
I'm not related to you.
You tell her yourself.

569
00:45:35,694 --> 00:45:37,252
Show up for what?

570
00:45:39,214 --> 00:45:40,932
She's in the hospital.

571
00:45:41,134 --> 00:45:43,489
- You visit every night?
- Yeah. What difference does it make?

572
00:45:43,694 --> 00:45:45,924
- You don't show up, it breaks routine.
- So?

573
00:45:46,374 --> 00:45:50,003
So people start looking for you,
this cab. That's not good.

574
00:45:51,854 --> 00:45:54,209
I'm not taking you to see my mother.

575
00:45:55,374 --> 00:45:58,127
Since when was
any of this negotiable?

576
00:46:04,334 --> 00:46:06,928
Two paces ahead, one to the left.

577
00:46:12,174 --> 00:46:14,563
Hey. Flowers?

578
00:46:15,054 --> 00:46:17,124
It's a waste of money.
Won't mean a thing to her.

579
00:46:19,214 --> 00:46:22,251
She carried you in her womb
for nine months.

580
00:46:26,374 --> 00:46:28,763
People buy flowers. Buy flowers.

581
00:46:28,974 --> 00:46:31,727
Excuse me. Keep the change.

582
00:46:42,254 --> 00:46:44,245
Hold that elevator, please.

583
00:46:47,174 --> 00:46:48,448
- Floor?
- Five. Thanks.

584
00:46:59,894 --> 00:47:03,967
- Having a good night?
- Mezzo e mezzo. You?

585
00:47:12,254 --> 00:47:13,812
Excuse me.

586
00:47:46,334 --> 00:47:47,847
Hey, Ma.

587
00:47:49,334 --> 00:47:52,724
- I've been calling and calling.
- Yeah, well, I got caught up at work.

588
00:47:52,934 --> 00:47:54,845
Why couldn't you call me
on the telephone?

589
00:47:55,054 --> 00:47:57,727
I'm lying here wondering
if something terrible happened to you.

590
00:47:57,934 --> 00:48:00,289
- I brought you flowers.
- What am I gonna do with flowers?

591
00:48:00,494 --> 00:48:02,610
- Cheer up.
- How?

592
00:48:02,814 --> 00:48:07,330
By worrying that you spend money
on stuff that's just gonna wilt and die?

593
00:48:07,534 --> 00:48:11,209
See what I mean? I didn't buy
you the flowers, Mom. He did.

594
00:48:11,414 --> 00:48:12,733
Who?

595
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:19,888
Why didn't you tell me
we had company?

596
00:48:21,934 --> 00:48:25,210
What's your name?
Sorry my son is rude.

597
00:48:25,454 --> 00:48:27,331
No harm done, ma'am.

598
00:48:27,534 --> 00:48:29,729
You paid for my flowers?

599
00:48:30,094 --> 00:48:31,766
They're beautiful.

600
00:48:39,694 --> 00:48:41,412
Well, Max?

601
00:48:44,694 --> 00:48:48,323
Mother, this is Vincent.
Vincent, this is my mother, Ida.

602
00:48:51,374 --> 00:48:53,604
I'm very happy to meet you,
Mrs. Durocher.

603
00:48:53,814 --> 00:48:55,327
Oh, just call me Ida.

604
00:48:55,534 --> 00:48:59,129
Ida. I was with Max
when he got the call.

605
00:48:59,334 --> 00:49:01,450
And you came all the way
over here to see me?

606
00:49:01,654 --> 00:49:04,452
- It's nothing, ma'am.
- Tell my son.

607
00:49:04,654 --> 00:49:08,488
You have to hold a gun to his head
to make him do anything.

608
00:49:08,694 --> 00:49:11,731
You must be one of Max's
important clients.

609
00:49:11,934 --> 00:49:15,973
Client? I... You know, I like
to think of myself as his friend.

610
00:49:16,334 --> 00:49:17,733
Max never had many friends.

611
00:49:17,934 --> 00:49:21,085
Always talking to himself
in the mirror. It's unhealthy.

612
00:49:21,294 --> 00:49:23,330
How many times I got to ask you?
Please don't do that.

613
00:49:23,534 --> 00:49:24,444
Do what?

614
00:49:24,654 --> 00:49:27,487
Don't talk about me like
I'm not right here in the room here.

615
00:49:27,694 --> 00:49:28,763
What's he saying?

616
00:49:28,974 --> 00:49:32,284
He says he's standing right here,
in the room here.

617
00:49:32,494 --> 00:49:35,327
Yes, you are. He's sensitive.

618
00:49:35,534 --> 00:49:38,685
I know. But I'm sure
you're very proud of him.

619
00:49:38,894 --> 00:49:42,648
Of course I'm proud.
He started with nothing, you know.

620
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:45,527
- Look at him today. Here, Vegas...
- Mom. Mom.

621
00:49:45,734 --> 00:49:48,851
Mom. Mom, he is not interested
in hearing about all that, okay?

622
00:49:49,054 --> 00:49:51,090
I came to see you, I saw you,
you look good, let's go.

623
00:49:51,294 --> 00:49:54,570
No, no, no. No, no, no.
I am very interested, Ida. Please.

624
00:49:54,774 --> 00:49:57,572
- Limousine companies.
- Is that right?

625
00:49:57,774 --> 00:49:59,685
He drives famous people around.

626
00:49:59,894 --> 00:50:01,850
Famous people.
Limousine companies.

627
00:50:02,054 --> 00:50:03,806
Now, that's quite an achievement.

628
00:50:04,014 --> 00:50:06,289
What did you say
your name was again?

629
00:50:06,494 --> 00:50:08,052
My name's Vincent, ma'am.

630
00:50:08,814 --> 00:50:12,090
- Visit again?
- No, I'm just in town tonight.

631
00:50:12,294 --> 00:50:14,524
- When you come back.
- Sure.

632
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:33,053
Max!

633
00:51:15,054 --> 00:51:16,373
Don't!

634
00:51:44,174 --> 00:51:48,929
All my prep was in there.
You are screwing with my work.

635
00:51:53,094 --> 00:51:55,289
Let's see what else you can do.

636
00:51:59,214 --> 00:52:03,173
Well, I've had four come in tonight.
Maybe one's your guy.

637
00:52:07,094 --> 00:52:10,530
No, not Ramone. Let's see this one.

638
00:52:15,334 --> 00:52:16,289
No, next.

639
00:52:16,494 --> 00:52:19,327
You know, something's funny
about this, though, you know?

640
00:52:19,614 --> 00:52:23,493
These three all came in within
half an hour of each other, right?

641
00:52:23,694 --> 00:52:28,814
The kid and that last guy,
both done by the same shooter, I think.

642
00:52:29,014 --> 00:52:32,006
- Why do you say that?
- Wound pattern.

643
00:52:32,934 --> 00:52:35,289
Two in the sternum, one in the head.

644
00:52:35,774 --> 00:52:38,572
This guy, he's shooting tight
groups too, all right? Check this out.

645
00:52:38,774 --> 00:52:42,050
Double taps are a couple
millimetres apart.

646
00:52:42,254 --> 00:52:44,165
Let's see this one.

647
00:52:52,654 --> 00:52:54,485
See what I mean?

648
00:52:56,374 --> 00:53:00,049
- Holy shit. Can I use your phone?
- Yeah.

649
00:53:05,254 --> 00:53:07,643
Come on, come on, wake up.

650
00:53:21,454 --> 00:53:23,172
- Hello.
- Hey, it's Fanning.

651
00:53:23,374 --> 00:53:25,968
I'm still down here at the morgue
at Sisters of Charity.

652
00:53:26,174 --> 00:53:28,051
The John Does didn't pan out,
but you'll never guess

653
00:53:28,254 --> 00:53:30,609
- who I got here in the meat locker.
- Who?

654
00:53:30,814 --> 00:53:34,170
Sylvester Clarke, criminal attorney
turned lawyer-criminal.

655
00:53:34,934 --> 00:53:37,687
Including Ramone,
who he represented,

656
00:53:37,894 --> 00:53:39,407
who's still missing.

657
00:53:39,614 --> 00:53:42,686
The both of whom are in the
exotic-substances business together.

658
00:53:42,894 --> 00:53:44,168
There's something going on,

659
00:53:44,374 --> 00:53:46,285
and I don't think the feds
know about it.

660
00:53:46,614 --> 00:53:49,811
Tell you what, stay on your cell phone.
I got the ASAC's phone. I'll hook up

661
00:53:50,014 --> 00:53:53,006
- with you in 30 minutes.
- Good.

662
00:53:58,894 --> 00:54:00,452
You're gonna go to a place
called El Rodeo.

663
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,531
It's on Washington Boulevard
in Pico Rivera.

664
00:54:02,734 --> 00:54:05,885
- Where at on Washington?
- Look it up.

665
00:54:10,174 --> 00:54:11,402
Limos, huh?

666
00:54:12,494 --> 00:54:13,449
Don't start.

667
00:54:13,974 --> 00:54:15,407
Hey, I'm not the one
lying to my mother.

668
00:54:16,174 --> 00:54:19,007
She hears what she wants to hear.
I don't disillusion her.

669
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,125
Yeah, right. Maybe she hears
what you tell her.

670
00:54:21,334 --> 00:54:23,131
Whatever I tell her is never
good enough anyway.

671
00:54:23,334 --> 00:54:24,562
It's always been that way.

672
00:54:26,134 --> 00:54:29,729
- So, what's at El Rodeo?
- Just drive.

673
00:54:30,894 --> 00:54:33,044
They project onto you their flaws.

674
00:54:33,254 --> 00:54:36,564
What they don't like about themselves,
their lives, whatever.

675
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:38,924
They rank on you instead.

676
00:54:40,374 --> 00:54:43,172
- How do you know?
- I had a father like that.

677
00:54:44,534 --> 00:54:45,603
Mothers are worse.

678
00:54:45,814 --> 00:54:48,282
Wouldn't know. My mother died
before I remember.

679
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:50,450
What happened to your father?

680
00:54:51,254 --> 00:54:53,404
Hated everything I did.

681
00:54:53,974 --> 00:54:59,173
Got drunk, beat me up, foster homes.
Went back with him. Like that.

682
00:55:01,414 --> 00:55:02,529
Then what?

683
00:55:05,294 --> 00:55:07,171
I killed him.

684
00:55:08,774 --> 00:55:10,332
I was 12.

685
00:55:17,854 --> 00:55:19,492
I'm kidding.

686
00:55:22,214 --> 00:55:24,170
He died of liver disease.

687
00:55:26,414 --> 00:55:29,724
- Well, I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

688
00:55:44,014 --> 00:55:47,529
So, what is this "driving a cab
temporarily"? It's just all bullshit, huh?

689
00:55:47,974 --> 00:55:51,603
- It is not bullshit.
- Twelve years isn't temporary, Max.

690
00:55:51,814 --> 00:55:55,284
Gotta get the cash together.
Insurance, bonds, maintenance, tires.

691
00:55:55,494 --> 00:55:56,973
Gotta staff up,
get the right client list.

692
00:55:57,174 --> 00:56:00,086
It's not just simply get the car
and put asses in the seats.

693
00:56:00,294 --> 00:56:03,331
- Why not?
- Because Island Limos

694
00:56:03,534 --> 00:56:08,927
is more than just a ride. It's a...
Like a club experience. Cool groove.

695
00:56:09,134 --> 00:56:12,968
Don't want it to end.
It's gotta be perfect.

696
00:56:13,614 --> 00:56:15,252
Perfect.

697
00:56:16,494 --> 00:56:18,530
It's up here. Turn right.

698
00:56:37,934 --> 00:56:41,609
- Give me your wallet. Come on.
- Give you my wallet. For what?

699
00:56:41,814 --> 00:56:45,443
I'll hold it for you in case
the people inside search you.

700
00:56:45,654 --> 00:56:48,122
- Who's searching?
- The people inside.

701
00:56:48,334 --> 00:56:50,848
Go in, ask for Felix.
He's expecting you.

702
00:56:51,054 --> 00:56:51,964
- Felix.
- Yeah.

703
00:56:52,174 --> 00:56:54,483
- What does he look like?
- I don't know, I've never met him.

704
00:56:54,694 --> 00:56:55,922
Who is he?

705
00:56:56,134 --> 00:56:58,489
He's connected to the guys
who hired me.

706
00:56:58,694 --> 00:57:00,764
- I don't get it.
- You destroyed my workups.

707
00:57:00,974 --> 00:57:01,929
Number four's due.

708
00:57:02,134 --> 00:57:04,409
What'd you think, night's over?
Called on account of rain?

709
00:57:04,614 --> 00:57:06,411
You go in there, say you're me.
Score the backups.

710
00:57:06,614 --> 00:57:08,605
They'll be on flash drive or CD.

711
00:57:08,814 --> 00:57:10,691
- Me? How come you don't go?
- I don't meet people.

712
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:13,727
Risk management. Anonymity. I protect
mine. You're not gonna screw that up.

713
00:57:13,934 --> 00:57:16,892
I got a contract with their bosses.
These guys don't get to meet me.

714
00:57:17,094 --> 00:57:18,891
They don't know what I look like.

715
00:57:21,014 --> 00:57:23,323
If I don't pull it off, then...

716
00:57:23,534 --> 00:57:25,889
They will kill you.
Now, you got ten minutes.

717
00:57:26,094 --> 00:57:27,322
At 10:01, I drive to the hospital

718
00:57:27,534 --> 00:57:29,331
and execute your mother
on my way out of town.

719
00:57:29,534 --> 00:57:32,287
- And don't pretend indifference.
- I can't do this.

720
00:57:32,494 --> 00:57:33,893
- I can't.
- What are you talking about?

721
00:57:34,094 --> 00:57:35,971
Sure you can, man.
Come on. Hey. Hey.

722
00:57:36,174 --> 00:57:39,450
Look, man, if I do this, I'm just gonna
end up getting other people killed.

723
00:57:39,654 --> 00:57:44,091
Out of options, Max. Just take comfort
in knowing you never had a choice.

724
00:57:44,854 --> 00:57:47,129
- How long you been doing this?
- Why?

725
00:57:47,374 --> 00:57:48,887
Just in case they ask me.

726
00:57:49,934 --> 00:57:53,290
- Private sector, six years.
- Okay. All right, six years.

727
00:57:53,494 --> 00:57:57,885
You get benefits? Or, you know,
like, insurance? Pension?

728
00:57:58,094 --> 00:58:01,973
No. No paid sick leave.
Quit stalling. Get out of the cab.

729
00:58:28,585 --> 00:58:30,940
- Yeah? Hold up.
- Hold on, man.

730
00:58:38,945 --> 00:58:40,583
Who is this?

731
00:58:44,345 --> 00:58:45,619
Mark the time.

732
00:58:50,825 --> 00:58:52,816
All right, it's cool.

733
00:58:56,625 --> 00:59:00,254
- What's up, homes?
- Hey. What's up?

734
00:59:00,465 --> 00:59:03,457
I'm here to see Felix.
He has something for me.

735
00:59:03,945 --> 00:59:05,344
Don't know no Felix.

736
00:59:09,865 --> 00:59:11,935
Tell him...

737
00:59:13,585 --> 00:59:16,782
Vince... Say it's Vincent.

738
00:59:16,985 --> 00:59:19,021
I'm Vincent.

739
00:59:31,545 --> 00:59:33,183
Copy.

740
00:59:34,545 --> 00:59:38,015
Let him in. Let him in right now.
Go ahead.

741
01:00:06,865 --> 01:00:09,538
Detective Richard Weidner, L.A.P.D.,
Major Narcotics Division.

742
01:00:09,745 --> 01:00:10,939
Detective Ray Fanning,

743
01:00:11,145 --> 01:00:13,705
- L.A.P.D., Major Narcotics.
- Hi, okay. Agent Frank Pedrosa.

744
01:00:13,905 --> 01:00:15,133
Good. Thanks for seeing us, Frank.

745
01:00:15,345 --> 01:00:16,824
Yeah, you're welcome.
How can I help?

746
01:00:17,025 --> 01:00:18,378
Why do you wanna know
about our case?

747
01:00:18,585 --> 01:00:21,224
- Any unusual activity tonight?
- Like what?

748
01:00:21,425 --> 01:00:23,143
That relates to a murder
or a series of murders

749
01:00:23,345 --> 01:00:26,303
in Wilshire Central
or West Hollywood?

750
01:00:26,505 --> 01:00:28,382
All quiet on the western front.

751
01:00:28,585 --> 01:00:31,258
Various people are asleep.
Various people are not.

752
01:00:31,465 --> 01:00:34,616
They come and go in cars,
pickups, taxis.

753
01:00:34,825 --> 01:00:36,941
Other than that, we watch air move.

754
01:00:38,345 --> 01:00:40,620
- Your interest in our case?
- Well, our interest...

755
01:00:40,825 --> 01:00:42,383
We got a situation. Two bodies.

756
01:00:42,585 --> 01:00:46,180
Could be a coincidence, could not be
a coincidence. It doesn't look like one.

757
01:00:46,385 --> 01:00:51,220
- We got an attorney and his client...
- Roof's all beat to shit.

758
01:00:51,545 --> 01:00:53,775
Roof's all beat to shit.

759
01:00:55,065 --> 01:00:57,295
- Can you zoom in on this, please?
- On what?

760
01:00:57,505 --> 01:00:59,223
On that.

761
01:01:03,945 --> 01:01:05,742
- Look at that right there.
- What is it?

762
01:01:10,025 --> 01:01:13,859
Yeah. 5-Queen-49974.

763
01:01:14,185 --> 01:01:16,301
5Q49974.

764
01:02:10,225 --> 01:02:12,420
I thought you'd be taller.

765
01:02:15,385 --> 01:02:17,182
So, Vincent...

766
01:02:20,745 --> 01:02:22,861
- What are the two names?
- Ramone Ayala and Clarke.

767
01:02:23,065 --> 01:02:25,499
Are you telling me Ramone Ayala
and Clarke were murdered tonight?

768
01:02:25,705 --> 01:02:27,457
- Both killed?
- Sylvester Clarke for sure.

769
01:02:27,665 --> 01:02:29,383
- Ramone, I don't know.
- I got another DOA.

770
01:02:29,585 --> 01:02:32,224
Daniel Baker out of South Central,
Leimert Park.

771
01:02:32,425 --> 01:02:33,335
That's three.

772
01:02:33,545 --> 01:02:34,864
- Three what?
- Witnesses.

773
01:02:36,345 --> 01:02:42,614
"Vincent meet their people
in Culiacán or Cartagena.

774
01:02:43,065 --> 01:02:46,102
But he don't meet you." Okay.

775
01:02:47,345 --> 01:02:49,540
Now you're here.

776
01:02:51,065 --> 01:02:52,339
Why?

777
01:02:55,665 --> 01:02:57,735
I lost my stuff.

778
01:02:58,665 --> 01:03:00,303
The list.

779
01:03:02,385 --> 01:03:06,173
I want you to listen to me real well.

780
01:03:07,025 --> 01:03:09,585
Special groups put together
the list of dedos.

781
01:03:09,785 --> 01:03:13,095
- Dedos?
- Fingers. Informants.

782
01:03:13,545 --> 01:03:16,298
Signal interceptions with
voice-recognition software,

783
01:03:16,505 --> 01:03:18,496
surveillance.

784
01:03:18,705 --> 01:03:22,778
A very expensive counterintelligence
worked up that list.

785
01:03:23,025 --> 01:03:26,700
An important list. Wouldn't you say?

786
01:03:27,625 --> 01:03:29,377
And you lost it?

787
01:03:31,665 --> 01:03:32,734
Yeah.

788
01:03:32,945 --> 01:03:34,617
I'm sorry.

789
01:03:35,865 --> 01:03:37,583
Sorry.

790
01:03:38,025 --> 01:03:42,780
Sorry? Sorry does not put
Humpty Dumpty back together again.

791
01:03:45,585 --> 01:03:48,258
- Do you believe in Humpty Dumpty?
- No.

792
01:03:48,465 --> 01:03:50,933
- Do you believe in Santa Claus?
- No.

793
01:03:51,145 --> 01:03:55,616
Nor do I. Nor do I, but my children do.
They are still small.

794
01:03:55,825 --> 01:04:00,740
But do you know who they like even
better than Santa Claus? His helper,

795
01:04:01,225 --> 01:04:05,377
Pedro el Negro. Black Peter. Yeah.

796
01:04:05,585 --> 01:04:09,373
There's an old Mexican tale
that tells of how Santa Claus

797
01:04:09,585 --> 01:04:11,974
got so very busy looking out
for the good children

798
01:04:12,185 --> 01:04:15,621
that he had to hire some help
to look out for the bad children.

799
01:04:15,825 --> 01:04:17,702
So he hired Pedro.

800
01:04:17,905 --> 01:04:19,463
And Santa Claus gave him a list

801
01:04:19,665 --> 01:04:22,975
with all the names
of all the bad children.

802
01:04:23,185 --> 01:04:25,824
And Pedro would come every night
to check them out.

803
01:04:26,025 --> 01:04:28,903
And the people, the little kids
that were misbehaving,

804
01:04:29,105 --> 01:04:31,096
that were not saying their prayers,

805
01:04:31,305 --> 01:04:35,742
Pedro would leave a little toy donkey
on their windows.

806
01:04:35,945 --> 01:04:37,503
A little burro.

807
01:04:37,705 --> 01:04:40,936
And he would come back. And if
the children were still misbehaving,

808
01:04:41,145 --> 01:04:42,339
Pedro would take them away,

809
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,581
and nobody would ever
see them again.

810
01:04:44,785 --> 01:04:49,700
Now, if I am being Santa Claus,
and you are Pedro,

811
01:04:49,905 --> 01:04:53,534
how do you think jolly old
Santa Claus would feel

812
01:04:53,745 --> 01:04:57,021
if one day Pedro came into his office
and said, "I lost the list"?

813
01:04:57,225 --> 01:05:00,217
How fucking furious
do you think he would get?

814
01:05:00,905 --> 01:05:02,657
Tell me, Vincent.

815
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:05,135
Tell me what you think.

816
01:05:07,625 --> 01:05:08,978
What?

817
01:05:11,665 --> 01:05:13,735
I think...

818
01:05:16,425 --> 01:05:18,814
I think you should tell the guy

819
01:05:19,185 --> 01:05:23,417
behind me to put that gun down.

820
01:05:23,945 --> 01:05:25,856
What did you say?

821
01:05:26,065 --> 01:05:28,898
I said, I think you should tell the guy
behind me to put his gun away

822
01:05:29,105 --> 01:05:32,415
before I take it and beat his
bitch ass to death with it.

823
01:05:42,425 --> 01:05:43,619
I picked up a tail.

824
01:05:44,185 --> 01:05:46,653
- Federal?
- I don't know, you tell me.

825
01:05:48,585 --> 01:05:50,815
That's why I tossed the list.

826
01:05:51,305 --> 01:05:53,535
The workups, all of that shit.

827
01:05:53,745 --> 01:05:57,624
To protect, in part, your...

828
01:05:57,825 --> 01:06:00,942
...Hermès, Façonnable ass.

829
01:06:05,945 --> 01:06:08,140
What do you think,
I like coming in here?

830
01:06:10,065 --> 01:06:11,657
But, hey,

831
01:06:12,025 --> 01:06:13,822
shit happens.

832
01:06:14,025 --> 01:06:16,619
Gotta roll with it. Adapt.

833
01:06:16,825 --> 01:06:19,385
Darwin. I Ching.

834
01:06:21,385 --> 01:06:23,023
- Has...?
- The fat man, the penthouse guy,

835
01:06:23,225 --> 01:06:25,261
the jazz man.

836
01:06:26,185 --> 01:06:28,176
That leaves two.

837
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:38,422
Can you finish?

838
01:06:39,505 --> 01:06:40,733
In six years...

839
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:45,581
...when have I not?

840
01:06:45,785 --> 01:06:47,935
Say it's Vincent.

841
01:06:48,265 --> 01:06:49,334
I'm Vincent.

842
01:06:49,865 --> 01:06:51,776
Say it's Vincent.

843
01:06:52,465 --> 01:06:53,898
I'm Vincent.

844
01:06:54,105 --> 01:06:55,857
Say it's Vincent.

845
01:06:56,945 --> 01:06:58,583
I'm Vincent.

846
01:06:58,785 --> 01:07:00,423
- Say it's Vincent.
- Vincent?

847
01:07:00,625 --> 01:07:03,344
- That's what I'm hearing.
- I'm Vincent.

848
01:07:25,585 --> 01:07:27,098
Your last two.

849
01:07:30,665 --> 01:07:34,180
And by the way,
as a token of my appreciation,

850
01:07:34,385 --> 01:07:36,216
I would like to offer you a discount.

851
01:07:38,825 --> 01:07:41,862
For all my services, 25 percent.

852
01:07:42,065 --> 01:07:44,738
- Very generous.
- Hell, make it 35.

853
01:07:46,665 --> 01:07:48,417
And, by the way...

854
01:07:51,305 --> 01:07:53,694
...Daniel said he was sorry.

855
01:07:57,705 --> 01:07:59,184
Interesting.

856
01:08:03,185 --> 01:08:04,220
Go to Fever.

857
01:08:04,865 --> 01:08:06,218
If something goes wrong...

858
01:08:07,825 --> 01:08:09,497
...kill him.

859
01:08:37,425 --> 01:08:39,143
- E-mail me his license.
- All right?

860
01:08:39,345 --> 01:08:40,903
- Right.
- To my cell phone.

861
01:08:41,185 --> 01:08:42,504
No, no, I'll wait.

862
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:45,538
Hey, is there anybody else
in that cab?

863
01:09:01,865 --> 01:09:03,981
Vegas odds would've been against you
walking out of there.

864
01:09:04,625 --> 01:09:07,014
Yeah, I'm very impressive.

865
01:09:09,465 --> 01:09:11,820
Sixth Street by Alexandria,
a club called Fever. You know it?

866
01:09:22,785 --> 01:09:25,538
Locate our witness, Peter Lim.
Get him evacuated, get him safe.

867
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:27,975
- L.A. 101 to chase units.
- Yeah.

868
01:09:28,185 --> 01:09:29,823
African-American, medium build.

869
01:09:30,025 --> 01:09:31,902
The assault team, when in place,
will do the takedown.

870
01:09:32,105 --> 01:09:33,538
- You sure?
- Do not spook him before.

871
01:09:33,745 --> 01:09:35,781
I want air support up
and to maintain at 1500 feet.

872
01:09:35,985 --> 01:09:36,940
Thank you.

873
01:09:42,185 --> 01:09:44,858
- How long?
- Twelve minutes.

874
01:09:45,065 --> 01:09:46,657
According to the cab company's
dispatch unit,

875
01:09:46,865 --> 01:09:48,901
this guy's been driving that cab
for 12 years.

876
01:09:49,105 --> 01:09:50,458
- So what?
- So you're telling me

877
01:09:50,665 --> 01:09:53,384
the guy walks into a phone booth
and, shazam,

878
01:09:53,585 --> 01:09:55,576
changes into a meat-eater
super-assassin?

879
01:09:55,785 --> 01:09:58,174
What's he do,
squeeze them in between fares?

880
01:09:58,385 --> 01:10:00,296
No, the real driver is floating
down a storm drain.

881
01:10:00,505 --> 01:10:02,541
The guy who walked out of there
looks like this guy.

882
01:10:02,745 --> 01:10:05,578
- He picked a driver who looks like him.
- Yeah, I don't know.

883
01:10:06,025 --> 01:10:07,777
I do. Zee?

884
01:10:07,985 --> 01:10:10,977
We see private-sector security
companies hiring out to cartels

885
01:10:11,185 --> 01:10:12,982
in Colombia, Russia, Mexico,

886
01:10:13,185 --> 01:10:17,701
hiring ex-Special Forces, Stasi,
ex-KGB, like that, all the time.

887
01:10:17,905 --> 01:10:21,534
Guys with trigger time, skill sets, real
tradecraft, like look like a cab driver.

888
01:10:21,865 --> 01:10:23,423
What are you gonna do?

889
01:10:23,905 --> 01:10:26,658
Take his ass down.
Save our witness.

890
01:10:31,905 --> 01:10:33,054
What if these guys are wrong?

891
01:10:33,265 --> 01:10:35,301
They got the guy admitting
his name is Vincent.

892
01:10:35,505 --> 01:10:38,303
- He's in there talking to the bad guys.
- There is something else going on.

893
01:10:38,505 --> 01:10:41,861
Ray, there's nothing else going on.
I thought there was, there isn't.

894
01:10:42,065 --> 01:10:44,374
It's their ball, it's their game.
There's nothing in it for us.

895
01:10:44,585 --> 01:10:46,337
- There's nothing in it for you.
- That's right.

896
01:10:46,545 --> 01:10:49,378
It's late. I'm going home.
You know what time it is?

897
01:11:39,225 --> 01:11:40,374
They locate Peter Lim yet?

898
01:11:46,705 --> 01:11:48,616
Sheila's on with the wife.
She thinks he's at Fever.

899
01:11:48,825 --> 01:11:50,258
Sixth and Alexandria. Move it.

900
01:11:50,465 --> 01:11:53,935
L.A. 101 to L.A. 103,
L.A. 105, L.A. 108.

901
01:11:54,145 --> 01:11:56,784
Witness is in a club called Fever,
Sixth and Alexandria.

902
01:11:56,985 --> 01:11:58,134
That's where Vincent is going.

903
01:11:58,345 --> 01:12:00,620
Assault team and remaining unit,
you will take Vincent.

904
01:12:00,825 --> 01:12:03,737
First unit on the scene will get
the witness, Peter Lim. Get him out.

905
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:07,494
L.A. 105 to L.A. 101. We copy that.

906
01:12:40,625 --> 01:12:42,741
- You gonna call her?
- Who?

907
01:12:42,945 --> 01:12:46,415
You know, your lady friend. The one
who gave you her business card.

908
01:12:46,625 --> 01:12:50,584
- I don't know. Maybe, maybe not.
- What?

909
01:12:51,505 --> 01:12:53,416
Pick up the phone.

910
01:12:54,145 --> 01:12:57,774
Life's short. One day, it's gone.

911
01:13:01,745 --> 01:13:04,896
You and I make it out of this alive,
you should call her.

912
01:13:05,785 --> 01:13:07,821
That's what I think.

913
01:13:09,745 --> 01:13:11,497
Anyway...

914
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:51,821
There he is. Hit it.

915
01:15:22,065 --> 01:15:23,737
Let's do it.

916
01:15:31,625 --> 01:15:34,503
The table towards the back
is where he hangs.

917
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:49,617
Wilke, take the right.
Brian, hold the door.

918
01:15:50,025 --> 01:15:52,414
Clean shots. Watch your backgrounds.
Watch your backgrounds.

919
01:15:52,625 --> 01:15:54,422
L.A.P.D.

920
01:16:47,065 --> 01:16:48,623
You move 15 feet ahead,
3 feet to the left.

921
01:16:48,825 --> 01:16:52,261
Wander, innocent bystanders
get the first rounds. Clear?

922
01:18:29,425 --> 01:18:32,542
There's Lim. Second booth
from the left. Get him out of here.

923
01:18:42,425 --> 01:18:45,064
Middle of the dance floor.
Freeze, Vincent!

924
01:18:45,265 --> 01:18:47,256
FBI! FBI! Get your hands in the air!

925
01:18:47,465 --> 01:18:49,057
Get your hands in the air, Vincent!

926
01:18:49,265 --> 01:18:52,257
- Freeze! Get your hands up!
- FBI. Where's Peter Lim?

927
01:18:52,585 --> 01:18:54,462
FBI! Get your hands in the air!

928
01:18:55,345 --> 01:18:56,903
Drop it!

929
01:18:58,225 --> 01:18:59,704
- Freeze!
- Freeze! FBI!

930
01:18:59,905 --> 01:19:02,294
- I'm not Vincent.
- FBI!

931
01:19:02,505 --> 01:19:04,780
Yo, put the gun down!
You got the wrong...

932
01:19:35,185 --> 01:19:37,858
Pedrosa's been shot. Get an RA unit.

933
01:19:55,425 --> 01:19:56,574
No, no, no! Wait, wait!

934
01:20:27,585 --> 01:20:29,496
Hey, hey! Hold on. Hold on.
I'm Detective Fanning.

935
01:20:29,705 --> 01:20:32,617
I'm Max! I'm Max! I'm a goddamn cab
driver, man! I'm a goddamn cab driver.

936
01:20:32,825 --> 01:20:35,498
I know. I know. I'm getting you out
of here. I'm L.A.P.D. Come on.

937
01:21:12,625 --> 01:21:14,377
- How'd you find me?
- You're okay. You're okay.

938
01:21:14,585 --> 01:21:16,257
Just move it. Keep moving.

939
01:21:25,105 --> 01:21:26,823
You're okay.

940
01:21:27,385 --> 01:21:29,979
- How'd you find me?
- You're okay. You're okay.

941
01:21:30,185 --> 01:21:32,745
You're okay. You're all right.

942
01:21:41,225 --> 01:21:42,624
Let's go!

943
01:21:45,145 --> 01:21:46,658
Let's go.

944
01:21:54,625 --> 01:21:56,661
Go! Drive! Drive!

945
01:22:32,625 --> 01:22:35,662
Only thing didn't show up
is the Polish cavalry.

946
01:22:36,825 --> 01:22:40,420
You're alive. I saved you.

947
01:22:42,425 --> 01:22:46,179
Do I get any thanks? No.
All you can do is clam up.

948
01:22:48,825 --> 01:22:51,293
You wanna talk?
Do you want me to fuck off?

949
01:22:51,505 --> 01:22:53,541
Fuck off.

950
01:22:55,825 --> 01:22:58,464
- You had to kill Fanning?
- Who the fuck is Fanning?

951
01:22:58,665 --> 01:23:00,656
Fanning, the cop.

952
01:23:02,105 --> 01:23:03,299
Why'd you have to kill him?

953
01:23:03,505 --> 01:23:05,973
He's probably got a family.
Kids are gonna grow up without him.

954
01:23:07,185 --> 01:23:08,857
He believed me.

955
01:23:09,105 --> 01:23:10,902
Oh, I should've saved him
because he believed you.

956
01:23:11,105 --> 01:23:12,697
- No, no. Not that.
- Yeah. That.

957
01:23:12,905 --> 01:23:14,384
Well, yeah, that.
What's wrong with that?

958
01:23:14,585 --> 01:23:16,655
- It's what I do for a living.
- Some living.

959
01:23:16,865 --> 01:23:19,015
- Head downtown.
- What's downtown?

960
01:23:19,225 --> 01:23:22,820
How are you at math?
I was hired for five hits. I did four.

961
01:23:24,905 --> 01:23:27,783
Why didn't you just kill me
and get another cab driver?

962
01:23:28,665 --> 01:23:30,860
Because you're good.
We're in this together.

963
01:23:31,065 --> 01:23:32,896
Fates intertwined.
Cosmic coincidence, you know.

964
01:23:33,105 --> 01:23:35,573
- Come on. You full of shit.
- All that crap. I'm full of shit?

965
01:23:35,785 --> 01:23:37,776
You're a monument of it.
You even bullshitted yourself,

966
01:23:37,985 --> 01:23:39,976
"All I am is taking out the garbage,
killing bad people."

967
01:23:40,185 --> 01:23:42,494
- Well, that's what you said.
- You believe me?

968
01:23:44,345 --> 01:23:47,143
- Then what'd they do?
- How do I know? You know?

969
01:23:47,345 --> 01:23:52,100
They all got that "witness
for the prosecution" look to me.

970
01:23:52,305 --> 01:23:54,182
Probably some major
federal indictment of somebody

971
01:23:54,385 --> 01:23:56,535
who majorly does not
wanna get indicted.

972
01:23:57,585 --> 01:23:59,576
So that's the reason?

973
01:24:00,105 --> 01:24:01,504
That's the why. There's no reason.

974
01:24:01,705 --> 01:24:04,424
There's no good reason,
there's no bad reason to live or to die.

975
01:24:05,585 --> 01:24:06,984
Then what are you?

976
01:24:07,585 --> 01:24:08,734
Indifferent.

977
01:24:11,625 --> 01:24:12,899
Get with it.

978
01:24:13,105 --> 01:24:15,141
Millions of galaxies
of hundreds of millions of stars

979
01:24:15,345 --> 01:24:17,859
and a speck on one in a blink.

980
01:24:18,265 --> 01:24:19,744
That's us. Lost in space.

981
01:24:20,425 --> 01:24:22,655
The cop, you, me,

982
01:24:23,105 --> 01:24:24,982
who notices?

983
01:24:33,105 --> 01:24:34,618
What's with you, man?

984
01:24:36,145 --> 01:24:37,703
As in?

985
01:24:38,065 --> 01:24:40,420
As in, if somebody had a gun
to your head and said,

986
01:24:40,625 --> 01:24:42,900
"You gotta tell me what's going on
with this person over here

987
01:24:43,105 --> 01:24:45,096
or I'm gonna kill you.

988
01:24:46,665 --> 01:24:49,384
What is driving him?
What was he thinking?"

989
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:52,179
You know, you couldn't do it,
could you?

990
01:24:52,625 --> 01:24:54,058
Because they would
have to kill your ass,

991
01:24:54,265 --> 01:24:58,463
because you don't know
what anyone else is thinking.

992
01:24:59,345 --> 01:25:02,621
I think you're low, my brother.
Way low.

993
01:25:03,385 --> 01:25:06,900
Like, what were you? One of those
institutionalized-raised guys?

994
01:25:07,105 --> 01:25:09,061
Anybody home?

995
01:25:09,265 --> 01:25:12,575
And... And the standard parts that
are supposed to be there in people,

996
01:25:12,785 --> 01:25:14,423
in you...

997
01:25:14,865 --> 01:25:16,378
...aren't.

998
01:25:20,625 --> 01:25:22,855
And why haven't you killed me yet?

999
01:25:26,185 --> 01:25:30,258
Of all the cabbies in L.A., I get Max,
Sigmund Freud meets Dr. Ruth.

1000
01:25:31,145 --> 01:25:32,976
Answer the question.

1001
01:25:35,225 --> 01:25:36,977
Look in the mirror.

1002
01:25:38,065 --> 01:25:40,374
Paper towels, clean cab,
limo company someday.

1003
01:25:40,585 --> 01:25:43,543
- How much you got saved?
- That ain't none of your business.

1004
01:25:43,745 --> 01:25:46,782
Someday?
"Someday my dream will come"?

1005
01:25:47,105 --> 01:25:49,938
One night you'll wake up,
and you'll discover it never happened.

1006
01:25:50,185 --> 01:25:55,305
It's all turned around on you.
It never will. Suddenly you are old.

1007
01:25:56,065 --> 01:25:57,100
Didn't happen.

1008
01:25:57,305 --> 01:26:00,058
And it never will, because you
were never gonna do it anyway.

1009
01:26:00,265 --> 01:26:03,223
You'll push it into memory,
then zone out in your Barcalounger,

1010
01:26:07,585 --> 01:26:09,382
Don't you talk to me about murder.

1011
01:26:09,585 --> 01:26:13,214
All it ever took was a down payment
on a Lincoln Town Car.

1012
01:26:13,425 --> 01:26:16,223
Or that girl.
You can't even call that girl.

1013
01:26:17,545 --> 01:26:20,218
What the fuck are you still doing
driving a cab?

1014
01:26:37,745 --> 01:26:40,578
Because I never straightened up
and looked at it, you know?

1015
01:26:40,785 --> 01:26:43,618
Myself. I should have.

1016
01:26:45,705 --> 01:26:50,096
I've tried to gamble my way out,
but that was just a born-to-Iose deal.

1017
01:26:50,385 --> 01:26:52,103
- Slow down.
- It's gotta be perfect.

1018
01:26:52,305 --> 01:26:55,775
It's got to be perfect to go.
Risk all torqued down.

1019
01:26:57,665 --> 01:27:00,259
I could've done it anytime
I wanted to.

1020
01:27:00,625 --> 01:27:01,614
Red light.

1021
01:27:08,705 --> 01:27:10,536
But you know what? New news:

1022
01:27:10,745 --> 01:27:13,737
It doesn't matter anyway.
What does it matter anyway?

1023
01:27:13,945 --> 01:27:17,381
We're all insignificant out here
in this big-ass nowhere.

1024
01:27:17,585 --> 01:27:19,621
The Twilight Zone shit.

1025
01:27:24,745 --> 01:27:26,701
Says the badass sociopath
in my back seat.

1026
01:27:31,505 --> 01:27:34,497
But you know what? That's the one
thing I gotta thank you for, bro.

1027
01:27:34,705 --> 01:27:36,821
Because until now,
I never looked at it that way.

1028
01:27:40,385 --> 01:27:43,502
What does it matter?
It don't, so fuck it. Fix it.

1029
01:27:44,145 --> 01:27:45,703
What do we got to lose anyway, right?

1030
01:27:46,865 --> 01:27:48,981
- Slow down.
- Why? You gonna shoot me?

1031
01:27:49,185 --> 01:27:50,584
You gonna pull the trigger
and kill us?

1032
01:27:50,785 --> 01:27:52,537
- Go ahead, shoot my ass.
- Slow the hell down.

1033
01:27:52,745 --> 01:27:55,384
You gonna shoot me? You gonna
shoot me now? You gonna kill us?

1034
01:27:55,585 --> 01:27:57,974
Well, shoot my ass, then.
Huh? Shoot me.

1035
01:27:58,185 --> 01:27:59,777
- Slow down!
- You're right.

1036
01:28:01,425 --> 01:28:02,824
You know what, Vincent?

1037
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:05,344
Go fuck yourself!

1038
01:28:36,905 --> 01:28:39,783
- Well, that was brilliant.
- Didn't have your seat belt on?

1039
01:29:17,065 --> 01:29:19,533
One-L-20, show me code six
at Olympic and Figueroa

1040
01:29:19,745 --> 01:29:21,019
on a TC with injuries.

1041
01:29:21,425 --> 01:29:25,543
- Copy your location.
- Sir, are you okay? What happened?

1042
01:29:26,305 --> 01:29:28,296
Sir, you were involved in an accident.

1043
01:29:28,505 --> 01:29:30,655
An ambulance is on its way
to help you.

1044
01:29:30,865 --> 01:29:33,937
You understand what I'm saying
to you? Sit down and relax, okay?

1045
01:29:36,665 --> 01:29:40,578
Okay. Don't worry about the cab.
They'll get you a new one.

1046
01:29:41,905 --> 01:29:44,260
Relax and breathe.

1047
01:29:57,305 --> 01:29:58,658
Put your hands up.

1048
01:29:58,865 --> 01:30:02,016
Put your hands up. Face the cab.
Get down on your knees.

1049
01:30:02,225 --> 01:30:04,261
- Go ahead and arrest me.
- Put your hands on your head.

1050
01:30:04,465 --> 01:30:06,023
Take me to jail.
L.A. County Jail's great.

1051
01:30:06,225 --> 01:30:09,661
Don't move! Put your hands
behind your head.

1052
01:30:15,265 --> 01:30:17,062
One-L-20, I need a backup
on a 187 suspect.

1053
01:30:29,665 --> 01:30:31,656
- Put your gun down!
- Get back! Put your hands down!

1054
01:30:31,865 --> 01:30:33,378
- Look, I gotta go.
- Put down the gun!

1055
01:30:33,585 --> 01:30:37,976
Stop moving! Stop moving!
When did this become a negotiation?

1056
01:30:40,385 --> 01:30:42,455
Clap your hands together.
Hold your hands together.

1057
01:30:42,665 --> 01:30:45,543
Listen, somebody's gonna get killed
if I don't go right now.

1058
01:30:45,745 --> 01:30:47,701
Now, cuff yourself.

1059
01:30:48,105 --> 01:30:51,017
I'm going to Sixth and Fig.
Call the cops.

1060
01:31:07,385 --> 01:31:11,378
- Give me that.
- Hey, hey, whoa! Fuck!

1061
01:31:37,265 --> 01:31:38,823
Come on!

1062
01:32:06,825 --> 01:32:09,862
Come on. Go through.

1063
01:32:10,745 --> 01:32:13,623
Come on. Come on. Pick up.

1064
01:32:31,265 --> 01:32:32,539
Pick up.

1065
01:32:34,105 --> 01:32:35,743
Come on, girl.

1066
01:32:37,105 --> 01:32:38,015
Come on, pick up.

1067
01:33:01,225 --> 01:33:02,260
U.S. Attorney's office.

1068
01:33:02,465 --> 01:33:03,454
- Annie!
- Yes.

1069
01:33:03,665 --> 01:33:05,974
It's Max.
Max, the cab driver.

1070
01:33:06,185 --> 01:33:07,300
Listen to me, all right?

1071
01:33:07,505 --> 01:33:09,143
- A guy named Vincent...
- Max.

1072
01:33:09,345 --> 01:33:11,301
Listen to me, Annie.

1073
01:33:11,905 --> 01:33:13,736
It's kind of a strange time
to be calling.

1074
01:33:13,945 --> 01:33:14,855
Listen. Listen, Annie.

1075
01:33:15,065 --> 01:33:18,182
There's a man named Vincent.
He's coming to kill you.

1076
01:33:19,345 --> 01:33:22,337
- He's what?
- Kill you! He's coming to kill you!

1077
01:33:22,545 --> 01:33:24,740
He was scoping out the building
when I dropped you off...

1078
01:33:24,945 --> 01:33:26,981
Okay, you know what?
Max, if this is supposed to be

1079
01:33:27,185 --> 01:33:29,176
some type of joke, it's not funny.

1080
01:33:29,385 --> 01:33:31,296
It's not a joke.
Annie, listen to me, please.

1081
01:33:31,505 --> 01:33:35,054
Felix hired him. Okay?
Or people that Felix worked for.

1082
01:33:35,265 --> 01:33:37,984
Felix Reyes-Torrena.
How do you know about my case?

1083
01:33:38,185 --> 01:33:39,459
I don't understand what's going on.

1084
01:33:39,665 --> 01:33:43,055
All I know is that he's already killed
witnesses. He's coming to kill you.

1085
01:33:43,945 --> 01:33:45,856
When I dropped you off,
I don't know how it happened,

1086
01:33:46,065 --> 01:33:47,100
but he ended up in my cab.

1087
01:34:06,945 --> 01:34:08,094
Annie.

1088
01:34:08,625 --> 01:34:10,934
Annie, listen. All I want you to do...

1089
01:34:19,025 --> 01:34:22,301
- I don't understand what's going on.
- Annie, listen. Listen. Please listen.

1090
01:34:43,465 --> 01:34:46,025
Get out of the building. Annie.

1091
01:34:50,345 --> 01:34:52,620
- I'm leaving the building right now.
- No, no, no, wait.

1092
01:34:53,665 --> 01:34:55,417
- Max.
- Wait, wait.

1093
01:34:57,425 --> 01:34:59,063
- Max.
- Listen, where are you right now?

1094
01:34:59,265 --> 01:35:00,778
- What floor?
- I'm on the 16th floor.

1095
01:35:00,985 --> 01:35:02,543
I'm in the law library and files.

1096
01:35:03,425 --> 01:35:05,541
He's two floors below you,
corner office.

1097
01:35:05,745 --> 01:35:06,780
In my office?

1098
01:35:06,985 --> 01:35:09,704
Listen, he does not know you're up
there. Just stay there and call 911.

1099
01:35:09,905 --> 01:35:11,736
Max, are you sure
he's on the 14th floor?

1100
01:35:11,945 --> 01:35:15,142
Listen, just stay there and just call
the police. Just call the police.

1101
01:35:15,705 --> 01:35:17,423
Max?

1102
01:35:20,665 --> 01:35:21,734
Shit.

1103
01:35:28,345 --> 01:35:29,937
Max?

1104
01:35:42,545 --> 01:35:44,854
- Max.
- He knows you're up there. Just...

1105
01:35:45,945 --> 01:35:47,139
I can't hear you. Hello?

1106
01:35:47,345 --> 01:35:49,381
Annie. Annie, listen to me.

1107
01:35:50,385 --> 01:35:51,340
Shit.

1108
01:35:54,225 --> 01:35:55,783
Annie. Annie!

1109
01:35:57,905 --> 01:35:59,463
Shit.

1110
01:36:53,185 --> 01:36:54,334
911. Operator.

1111
01:36:54,545 --> 01:36:57,059
Yes. Listen, there is a man
in my building, and he is...

1112
01:37:01,585 --> 01:37:03,257
Hello?

1113
01:40:03,985 --> 01:40:05,703
Let her go.

1114
01:40:06,185 --> 01:40:07,777
Max?

1115
01:40:09,825 --> 01:40:11,941
Why? What are you gonna
do about it?

1116
01:40:15,945 --> 01:40:17,537
Come on.

1117
01:40:30,025 --> 01:40:31,617
Max!

1118
01:40:49,865 --> 01:40:53,824
- God. Felix Reyes-Torrena?
- Yeah. I met him.

1119
01:40:54,025 --> 01:40:55,822
What do you mean,
you met him? How?

1120
01:40:56,025 --> 01:40:59,222
I don't know. Look, when I
dropped you off, there was a fare.

1121
01:40:59,425 --> 01:41:01,256
- He said his name is Vincent.
- Vincent?

1122
01:41:07,985 --> 01:41:11,341
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- This is the street.

1123
01:41:12,305 --> 01:41:14,296
This way. Come on.

1124
01:41:41,425 --> 01:41:43,097
Stay up. Stay up. Stay up.

1125
01:41:46,305 --> 01:41:47,533
No, no. This way.

1126
01:42:10,265 --> 01:42:11,459
Wait, wait. Wait. Wait.

1127
01:42:34,865 --> 01:42:35,775
Stay down.

1128
01:43:22,385 --> 01:43:24,057
Shit.

1129
01:43:31,185 --> 01:43:33,062
There's a station.

1130
01:44:11,945 --> 01:44:13,617
Shit.

1131
01:44:46,665 --> 01:44:47,575
Max!

1132
01:44:49,905 --> 01:44:51,338
I do this for a living!

1133
01:45:59,985 --> 01:46:01,737
We're almost...

1134
01:46:02,545 --> 01:46:04,661
...at the next stop.

1135
01:46:06,265 --> 01:46:08,062
Hey, Max.

1136
01:46:11,225 --> 01:46:15,013
A guy gets on the MTA here
in L.A. And dies.

1137
01:46:20,025 --> 01:46:22,300
Think anybody will notice?
