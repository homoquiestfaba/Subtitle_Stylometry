00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,440
Nice shirt!

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,440
What? Me?

4
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,180
Your shirt… is really nice.

5
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,520
Oh really? Thanks, it's old.

6
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,800
It looks really comfortable.

7
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,180
I guess.

8
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,300
What fabric is that made of?

9
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,400
Gonna have to go with cotton on that one.

10
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,460
100% I’m sure.

11
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,900
I’m Joseph.

12
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,640
Alan.

13
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,200
(Both) Nice to meet you.

15
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,520
Hey babe, what’s going on?

16
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,000
Yeah? Ok. Alright. Bye.

17
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,620
Would you by any chance mind watching my stuff real quick? I'm just running an errand.

18
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,840
- Totally.
- Thank you.

19
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,080
What’s wrong sweetie?

20
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,480
Somebody stole my clothes!

21
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,240
Don’t worry, your friend took them.

22
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,240
My friend, what?!

23
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,300
Fuck!

24
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,080
Hey!

25
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,800
What are you doing here?

26
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,320
Hmm...

27
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,760
That's my shirt.

28
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,160
No, it’s not.

29
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,220
Yes it is, it doesn’t even fit you.

30
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:50,590
It looks actually ridiculous. Give it back. Now.

31
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,640
Make me.

32
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,400
Seriously. You’re gonna hit me with a hanger?

33
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:57,760
Relax!

34
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,180
Relax.

35
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,260
Give it back.

36
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,260
Now.

37
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,180
Get it off.

38
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,919
Pants too.

39
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,560
Ok, oh right.

40
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,100
Oh right.

41
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,460
What?

42
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,860
These are mine.

43
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,680
Yeah, they look really good.

44
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,780
Thanks.

45
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,020
I like these.

46
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,040
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

47
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,440
I got it from the laundromat down the street.

48
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,240
It’s opened 24-7, you know.
