Vámonos.

There is some unit

I take the stairways.

44
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:06,811
Veto, calm.

45
00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:00,886
Are you well?, already everything is
well, calm down.

46
00:04:09,313 --> 00:04:12,633
I request reinforcement
immediately.

47
00:04:12,668 --> 00:04:15,536
Stevenson, where are you?,
stay there.

48
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,827
Okey, you already have it.

49
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:33,107
He/she resisted.

50
00:04:33,142 --> 00:04:34,345
Not a lot.

51
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,195
He/she hears, your power is
in your head.

52
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,811
Very well, but me.

53
00:04:39,758 --> 00:04:41,219
Okey, we go.

54
00:04:41,854 --> 00:04:44,190

<i > Expert, past the report.</i>

56
00:04:55,394 --> 00:04:57,156
Kyla, I have to wonder.

57
00:04:58,012 --> 00:04:59,440
Are you sure?

58
00:04:59,475 --> 00:05:00,852
Do you want to make this?

59
00:05:00,887 --> 00:05:03,814
I need the chip of the one
police, to enter to the warehouse.

60
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:07,314
They have valuable forces.

61
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:09,496
Not we will negotiate.

62
00:05:09,531 --> 00:05:10,815
If.

63
00:05:34,818 --> 00:05:37,133
Calm.

64
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:42,592
Come you, we go.

65
00:06:18,952 --> 00:06:21,104
How does he/she go you today?

66
00:06:25,107 --> 00:06:28,937
With gracefulness, you have
electric sensors.

67
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,260
We will make it.

68
00:06:30,295 --> 00:06:31,549
You allow me.

69
00:06:31,952 --> 00:06:34,431
This doesn't work if
you make many enemy.

70
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:36,911
It will work, when he/she sees the
truth, will come.

71
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,702
My payment.

72
00:06:38,737 --> 00:06:41,434
I will give it to you. The chip has
that to be safe.

73
00:06:49,883 --> 00:06:51,191
Veto of here.

74
00:07:04,797 --> 00:07:07,107
Base, Send me to somebody.

75
00:07:07,142 --> 00:07:08,698

77
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:20,155

78
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,612
<i > Ahead, please.</i>

79
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:39,309
<i > Ahead, please.</i>

80
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:41,842
A false alarm.

81
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:43,657
<i > Expert.</i>

82
00:07:47,307 --> 00:07:52,886
Gentlemen, the security of
the city is for the floor.

83
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:58,679
They are about destroying the
our security.

84
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:01,860
Each accident.

85
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:03,717
We are forced to
to take a new partner.

86
00:08:03,752 --> 00:08:05,453
The new partner.

87
00:08:05,488 --> 00:08:07,120
It is for 10 years.

88
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:12,886
We want to see who is
making this.

89
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:14,924
Stealing us the strength.

90
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,474
They are infiltrating in
our society.

91
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:21,544
They receive the support of
the civilians.

92
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:24,262
I want them to stop them.

93
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:29,255
Not they are common, they have one
see different from the politics.

94
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,667
Not it is the typical one and
marginal character.

95
00:08:32,702 --> 00:08:36,045
That it uses the crime and those
low businesses.

96
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,242
These are fanatic.

97
00:08:38,277 --> 00:08:40,369
Very organized.

98
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:42,690
They manufacture and they implant
bombs.

99
00:08:42,725 --> 00:08:45,324
That they call themselves to if
same, rebellious.

100
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:49,788
Increasing the terrifying thing.

101
00:08:49,823 --> 00:08:52,280
In our society.

102
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:54,738

I call them to inform them that
we have a level of terrorists.

108

111
00:09:42,993 --> 00:09:46,004
<i > But Sr. Valentine is
taking charge here of that.</i>

112
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,502
<i > That is not... </i>

00:09:47,537 --> 00:09:49,387
Our Intelligence us

Sr Valentine doesn't satisfy... </i>

119
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,061
<i > AND we have to make
some changes.</i>

120
00:10:07,096 --> 00:10:10,369
After everything,
we all are together.

121
00:10:10,404 --> 00:10:12,247
Thank you.

122
00:10:12,282 --> 00:10:13,819
Can I speak to him/her?

123
00:10:16,806 --> 00:10:18,656
This Council is clever

<i > you are witness that not
it is clever.</i>

125
00:10:21,703 --> 00:10:23,383

<i > AND he/she has also given them a
mistaken concept.</i>

129
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,763
With their permission I have made
everything to convince them.

130
00:10:36,798 --> 00:10:40,310
So that they see the seriousness
of the situation.

131

<i > Sr. Valentine, our interest
common it is to protect to the society.</i>

132
00:10:44,307 --> 00:10:46,853
It is necessary to catch to those
rebellious.

133
00:10:46,888 --> 00:10:50,308
They want to eliminate to those
bosses of the system.

134
00:10:50,343 --> 00:10:52,614
<i > A common interest.</i>

135
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:54,810

00:10:54,845 --> 00:10:56,972
I will make it, Sr. Kirkland,
Thank you.

137
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:45,654
Thank you.

You were right, we should

139
00:12:19,527 --> 00:12:21,900
Friends, listen.

140
00:12:22,432 --> 00:12:23,968
They are difficult times.

141
00:12:24,321 --> 00:12:27,252
The government will get up
with us.

142
00:12:27,287 --> 00:12:29,980
We will take out the policeman
to our side.

143
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,673
It is supposed that we have
that to give him/her lasts.

144
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:34,820
And something.

145
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,753
To hunt them as rats.

146
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:38,616
Do they know what I say?

147
00:12:38,651 --> 00:12:40,673
I say that we fight
against them.

149
00:12:43,581 --> 00:12:45,655
And I say that we make it
twice as much.

150
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,504
If, well.

151
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:49,083
We will begin with the tower
of communication.

152
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,858
The tower of the center
of the net where they work.

153
00:12:51,893 --> 00:12:53,298
<i > If we take it.</i>

154

Thank you.

161
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,875
Curse.

162
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:38,219
- Forget it.
- What demon... 

163
00:13:38,254 --> 00:13:39,513
Will you eat that?

164
00:13:39,548 --> 00:13:40,738
What does he/she spend?

165
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:42,878
Not him you.

166
00:13:43,604 --> 00:13:47,714
It is as if there was something
in the food.

167
00:13:47,749 --> 00:13:51,301
Not you, is as if
it was in two I siege at the same time.

00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,293
We go in road.

174

Monitor.

175
00:14:47,752 --> 00:14:51,767
To begin communication.

176
00:15:02,808 --> 00:15:04,480
Clever.

To load.

178
00:15:09,423 --> 00:15:12,216
Loading.

179
00:15:21,783 --> 00:15:23,653
It loads canceled.

180
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:48,507
You?

181
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:49,725
You are arrested.

182
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,954
For crimes
to the government.

183
00:16:51,989 --> 00:16:53,719
To resist to a
official of police.

184
00:16:53,754 --> 00:16:56,340
Without mentioning the destruction of my
identification of security.

185
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,301
And terrorism to those
federal laws.

186
00:16:58,336 --> 00:17:00,267
You are in serious problems.

187
00:17:00,302 --> 00:17:02,374
I want to show you something.

188
00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:04,411
Lie, Srta.
turn you.

189
00:17:04,446 --> 00:17:07,197
We remove you the chip
that it provokes you illusions.

190
00:17:07,232 --> 00:17:09,426
You have had to see it.

191
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,620
You have to see it.

192
00:17:12,136 --> 00:17:15,400
Instead of spending those
taxes in improvements.

193
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:18,664
They keep the money
and they give them garbage.

194
00:17:20,258 --> 00:17:21,568
Of what not one speaks.

195
00:17:21,603 --> 00:17:23,013
Turn you.

196
00:17:24,183 --> 00:17:25,276
You dressed him.

197
00:17:27,128 --> 00:17:28,777
You dressed him.

198
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,026
Hold.

199
00:17:33,015 --> 00:17:36,005
I saw it to him and you.

200
00:17:36,393 --> 00:17:38,044
To what do they play?

201
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,745
Not you will be able to hide it.

202
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,620
Soon you will see
what happens.

203
00:18:03,318 --> 00:18:07,835
<i > Unit 1760 reporting
to the command.</i>

204
00:18:13,943 --> 00:18:16,111
Beginning communication.

205
00:18:22,616 --> 00:18:24,512
I want information of
this individual.

206
00:18:31,796 --> 00:18:33,393
To look for coincidence.

207
00:18:49,007 --> 00:18:52,005
Coincidence not
opposing.

208
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,478
New search.

209
00:19:03,302 --> 00:19:05,279
Ahead.

210
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,553
Possible location.

211
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,757
Specimen.

212
00:19:18,673 --> 00:19:22,609
To include alone the location.

213
00:19:28,764 --> 00:19:29,869
The whole system.

214
00:19:30,998 --> 00:19:32,047
Location in Monitor.

215
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:40,517
Now, give me the location
of the fellow.

216
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,081
99.6 grades.

217
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,613
I object opposing.

218
00:20:01,073 --> 00:20:03,812
Computer, erases everything
that of minutes ago.

219
00:20:03,847 --> 00:20:05,821
Erasing files.

220
00:20:08,503 --> 00:20:10,253
Mr..

221
00:20:12,568 --> 00:20:14,526
You where those are
rebellious.

222
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:15,856
Do you know it now?

223
00:20:15,984 --> 00:20:20,123
If, and Mister,
we have a traitor.

224
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:24,542
Tell me more.

225
00:20:24,577 --> 00:20:26,000
One of us.

226
00:20:26,035 --> 00:20:28,919
He/she says that he/she feels as if
it was at the same time in two places.

227
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:31,458
Steven says that he saw
to the woman.

228
00:20:32,142 --> 00:20:34,401
I enter to the Tower last night.

229
00:20:35,395 --> 00:20:37,786
And him the accent yes.

230
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:40,513
It seems that it is of the one
another side.

231
00:20:40,548 --> 00:20:42,580
29 years, he/she doesn't have chip.

232
00:20:44,093 --> 00:20:45,641
Good work.

233
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:57,796
We will see it now.

234
00:21:01,043 --> 00:21:02,612
He/she lives in the building.

235
00:21:04,252 --> 00:21:06,039
Bring it here, now.

236
00:21:06,074 --> 00:21:10,379
<i > Alex McDowell, report you
with Valentine immediately.</i>

237
00:21:10,414 --> 00:21:13,557
<i > Reports you with Valentine
immediately.</i>

238
00:21:20,389 --> 00:21:22,740
Security Valentine.

239
00:21:24,735 --> 00:21:26,454
Mr..

240
00:22:00,314 --> 00:22:03,301
Care with that team.

241
00:22:04,554 --> 00:22:09,228
If you don't care,
we will talk about it.

242
00:22:09,263 --> 00:22:11,035
They come, sit down.

243
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,807
Thank you, Mister.

244
00:22:22,397 --> 00:22:27,317
Not I have seen the report of
the elimination of the rebels.

245
00:22:27,352 --> 00:22:29,493
How does the investigation go?

246
00:22:29,777 --> 00:22:33,472
I make it, I have much
information, Mister.

247
00:22:33,507 --> 00:22:37,181
I want it quick, I have
a lot of pressure of the Council.

248
00:22:37,216 --> 00:22:41,509
This Council presses us.

249
00:22:41,544 --> 00:22:43,077
Expert.

250
00:22:46,345 --> 00:22:48,625
Probably those
let us have today, Mister.

251
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,557
Can I ask him/her a question?

252
00:22:50,592 --> 00:22:51,663
Ahead.

253
00:22:51,698 --> 00:22:54,203
What he/she promises them you are
people.

254
00:22:54,238 --> 00:22:55,874
To get the help.

255
00:22:56,238 --> 00:22:59,709
That is to say, how alternative
does he/she give to the society?

256
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,447
Alternative.

257
00:23:04,513 --> 00:23:07,928
You really believe that him
do they offer alternative?

258
00:23:10,778 --> 00:23:14,377
I believe that the human nature
it is about improving.

259
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,010
Amid this
society.

260
00:23:17,616 --> 00:23:21,493
Good, if he/she believes in that, then
you belong this society.

261
00:23:21,528 --> 00:23:23,369
And you should protect it.

262
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,407
If.

263
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,264
Then, continue.

264
00:23:35,298 --> 00:23:36,644
If, Mister.

265
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:47,163
It is difficult to believe that
people is it is chequeada.

266
00:23:47,198 --> 00:23:49,277
This will be big.

267
00:23:50,285 --> 00:23:52,399
He knows, you see us.

268
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,193
The ones?

269
00:23:54,228 --> 00:23:55,414
Let us prove it.

270
00:23:58,453 --> 00:24:03,542
No, Alex MacDowell
it will be more useful for us.

271
00:24:03,577 --> 00:24:05,130
Otherwise.

272
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,316
Rusell.

273
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:17,500
- If.
- He/she Calls to David.

274
00:24:17,535 --> 00:24:19,122
Thank you.

275
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:26,167
He/she Hears, Davidson.

276
00:24:57,979 --> 00:24:59,250
They are here.

277
00:25:57,646 --> 00:25:58,949
He/she hears.

278
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,027
MacDowell, you are a traitor.

279
00:26:32,062 --> 00:26:34,094
You hear me, a traitor.

280
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,847
He/she hears, calm down.

281
00:27:06,026 --> 00:27:08,701
Hold and you leave me
of using immediately.

282
00:27:08,736 --> 00:27:12,400
It was so difficult to help you and now
you shoot me in the head.

283
00:27:12,435 --> 00:27:13,931
Why do you lie me?

284
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,217
- I believe that it was my partner.
- Lie.

285
00:27:18,826 --> 00:27:22,854
He/she looks, I have to think
where to go, well.

286
00:27:22,889 --> 00:27:24,748
Save you your life.

287
00:27:24,783 --> 00:27:27,628
Not he/she had problems in my
career before, now I believe that if.

288
00:27:35,013 --> 00:27:36,930
It continues managing.

289
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:38,853
I know a place.

290
00:27:52,969 --> 00:27:58,107
He/she leaves the bodies, somebody
he/she will know that we were those of security.

291
00:28:01,562 --> 00:28:03,067
We have one I live.

292
00:28:04,213 --> 00:28:06,214
Excellent, bring it.

293
00:28:41,881 --> 00:28:43,401
Take it.

294
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:45,467
Correct.

295
00:28:45,502 --> 00:28:47,062
Electric Luz and it illuminates.

296
00:28:47,097 --> 00:28:48,587
They created me to feel it.

297
00:28:48,622 --> 00:28:49,845
Now I don't have my chip
of identification.

298
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:51,254
It is intelligent.

299
00:28:55,617 --> 00:28:56,786
Not I can recommend you it.

300
00:28:58,108 --> 00:28:59,333
Do you work?

301
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,145
Of course that not.

302
00:29:05,527 --> 00:29:07,633
<i > Any persecution.</i>

303
00:29:08,684 --> 00:29:10,900
<i > Any persecution.</i>

304
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,790
Let us don't imagine that
you lived here.

305
00:29:22,156 --> 00:29:24,159
If, him you.

306
00:29:41,483 --> 00:29:42,821
I Associate San José.

307
00:30:09,367 --> 00:30:11,753
It is it is the house.

308
00:30:11,788 --> 00:30:13,618
A lot of people have been here.

309
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,729
Why me?

310
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,167
We need a policeman.

311
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,420
There are thousands.

312
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,446
I tell you so that you are here.

313
00:30:28,481 --> 00:30:29,559
We will see.

314
00:30:32,134 --> 00:30:33,895
We put something basic.

315
00:30:34,922 --> 00:30:38,467
We put electricity,
it is easier to have it.

316
00:30:38,944 --> 00:30:40,885
You were in the list.

317
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,826
With an entire dedication.

318
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,740
And it had not been
promoted.

319
00:30:48,557 --> 00:30:50,053
As it is.

320
00:30:50,088 --> 00:30:53,879
You think that you will use me
for your cause.

321
00:30:53,914 --> 00:30:55,559
Treatment of making it.

322
00:30:56,211 --> 00:30:58,287
A man that me
he/she says that it is not an order.

323
00:30:58,322 --> 00:30:59,658
Does it bother you?

324
00:31:06,854 --> 00:31:08,585
Allow me to see it.

325
00:31:24,121 --> 00:31:28,358
Then, how well him ago
a policeman to the rebels?

326
00:31:28,393 --> 00:31:30,495
While you were
in security.

327
00:31:32,554 --> 00:31:35,085
The stupid leaders of those
terrorists sell drug to people.

328
00:31:36,084 --> 00:31:37,624
The terrorists those
they obtain of the south.

329
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:39,165
And those of the South sell it
to the other ones.

330
00:31:40,102 --> 00:31:42,463
State Security.

331
00:31:45,902 --> 00:31:47,892
It complicates at the first.

332
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:55,021
Okey, we will say that
they have their man.

333
00:31:55,056 --> 00:31:56,264
What will they make?

334
00:31:56,299 --> 00:31:57,323
To exploit the building.

335
00:31:57,358 --> 00:31:58,773
No, we won't make it.

336
00:31:58,808 --> 00:32:01,791
That is a privilege that there will be
until fixing the system.

337
00:32:02,906 --> 00:32:04,944
I have virus in my chip.

338
00:32:04,979 --> 00:32:07,786
With that we will be able to destroy
the program of illusions.

339
00:32:07,821 --> 00:32:10,189
If we enter,
without being seen.

340
00:32:10,684 --> 00:32:14,078
We will put the virus and the one
system will never fix it.

341
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:17,274
For that reason we need a
police.

342
00:32:18,698 --> 00:32:24,217
You don't worry about to take
virus in your chip?

343
00:32:24,252 --> 00:32:25,468
I don't care it.

344
00:32:26,439 --> 00:32:28,176
It removes the bandage and you go.

345
00:32:36,926 --> 00:32:40,154
Okey, has the policeman.

346
00:32:41,012 --> 00:32:43,175
My chip no longer serves.

347
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:45,313
Perhaps not.

348
00:32:45,348 --> 00:32:47,437
Whenever we have
to the correct person.

349
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,746
You have to take care
your diet.

350
00:33:06,941 --> 00:33:08,190
Hello Doc.

351
00:33:08,225 --> 00:33:09,405
I need you.

352
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,876
No, to work for you
it is very dangerous.

353
00:33:11,911 --> 00:33:12,954
I need you now.

354
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:16,110
It will cost you twice as much.

355
00:33:16,145 --> 00:33:17,564
Okey, we go.

356
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:19,203
Demeo is looking for you.

357
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:21,637
Move.

358
00:33:21,672 --> 00:33:24,905
OH sits down it, the other night.

359
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,983
It was a great error.

360
00:33:26,018 --> 00:33:27,319
- Vámonos.
- It was a great accident.

361
00:33:27,354 --> 00:33:28,626
We go.

362
00:33:30,674 --> 00:33:33,895
Is this the patient?

363
00:33:34,764 --> 00:33:39,106
The rebels steal chip,
I don't want to know about that.

364
00:34:00,461 --> 00:34:01,852
Where am I?

365
00:34:01,887 --> 00:34:03,185
Grandiose, the patient
it is awake.

366
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:06,397
- What?, which patient?
- Somebody him of something.

367
00:34:06,432 --> 00:34:08,511
I believe that it is better
to give him/her Chloroform.

368
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,212
We go, hurry.

369
00:34:15,405 --> 00:34:16,644
It is well.

370
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,884
He/she waits.

371
00:34:38,054 --> 00:34:39,576
They will make me
this to my?

372
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:41,191
No, he doesn't feel anything.

373
00:34:41,226 --> 00:34:42,571
Because you don't remove him/her
the stain.

374
00:35:08,049 --> 00:35:10,565
If, I have you.

375
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,664
Here it is,
the next one kills.

376
00:35:30,411 --> 00:35:32,511
Not it is in white.

377
00:35:32,546 --> 00:35:35,074
It has not still recognized
the body.

378
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:43,074
What there is if the two chip
do they send information?

379
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:44,239
They won't make it.

380
00:35:44,274 --> 00:35:46,362
This erases to the other one.

381
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:50,892
The body doesn't send him/her energy
if he/she dies, but to the new one.

382
00:35:50,927 --> 00:35:55,217
I am giving him/her electricity
to help to the chip.

383
00:35:58,183 --> 00:36:02,296
Believe me, I have made it
many times.

384
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,495
Here we have it.

385
00:36:18,136 --> 00:36:22,352
Official Stevenson, I have
the honor of being to their service.

386
00:36:22,387 --> 00:36:23,594
Well.

387
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:33,258
I joust there, there is an entrance.

388
00:36:33,293 --> 00:36:36,692
It is used in extreme cases.

389
00:36:37,734 --> 00:36:39,788
It takes to the door
of the Security.

390
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:41,150
I believe that they shot us.

391
00:36:41,185 --> 00:36:45,589
Well, it is where the one is
recognition system.

392
00:36:47,136 --> 00:36:48,914
I believe that I can manage it.

393
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,702
Well, let us make it.

394
00:37:43,463 --> 00:37:46,574
<i > The defined man,
he/she is Stevenson, a moment.</i>

395
00:37:53,909 --> 00:37:57,440
<i > The defined man,
he/she is Stevenson, a moment.</i>

396
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:06,905
<i > The defined man,
he/she is Stevenson, a moment.</i>

397
00:38:19,612 --> 00:38:21,885
The computer is
working.

398
00:38:31,115 --> 00:38:34,027
He/she says that it has been replaced.

399
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,471
You never played
the team.

400
00:38:37,071 --> 00:38:38,920
I am different.

401
00:38:38,955 --> 00:38:41,561
Step the information
electronically.

402
00:38:41,596 --> 00:38:44,428
But you should happen
the insurance of Security.

403
00:38:46,038 --> 00:38:47,179
Clever.

404
00:38:57,139 --> 00:38:58,760
We go.

405
00:39:00,874 --> 00:39:02,000
Monitor.

406
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,171
OH for heaven's sake, there it is.

407
00:39:09,745 --> 00:39:12,702
Quick, before
Valentine comes.

408
00:39:17,824 --> 00:39:19,758
Countersign.

409
00:39:19,793 --> 00:39:21,657
Code.

410
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:22,887
Allowed access.

411
00:39:26,049 --> 00:39:27,566
Refused access.

412
00:39:27,601 --> 00:39:29,049
Not he/she responds.

413
00:39:29,084 --> 00:39:30,483
I will try again.

414
00:39:36,031 --> 00:39:37,081
What is that?

415
00:39:37,116 --> 00:39:38,514
A protection code.

416
00:39:38,549 --> 00:39:39,697
Not you can run him.

417
00:39:39,732 --> 00:39:42,285
No, I am not able to.

418
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,360
I believe that the code
it is missed.

419
00:39:45,515 --> 00:39:47,581
- We go, we go.
- What does it mean?

420
00:39:52,714 --> 00:39:54,451
It is the alarm, we have
that to leave of here.

421
00:39:54,486 --> 00:39:56,969
If, vámonos.

422
00:40:05,968 --> 00:40:10,689
<i > I Warn, two fellows in the one
Center of Security.</i>

423
00:40:10,724 --> 00:40:12,919

424
00:40:12,954 --> 00:40:15,267

427
00:40:30,281 --> 00:40:32,683
<i > Stops police,
I don't have their identification.</i>

428
00:40:32,718 --> 00:40:33,841
He/she is my small brother.

429
00:40:33,876 --> 00:40:37,432
<i > you don't move,
wait the control < /i>

430
00:40:37,467 --> 00:40:39,415

<i > San John Happens.

432
00:40:46,875 --> 00:40:48,606
He/she runs.

433
00:40:51,355 --> 00:40:54,055
That was well, but how us
will we save of the other ones?

434
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:59,379
One fallen, and the control
power station will send to all.

435
00:40:59,414 --> 00:41:02,463
- Not we will be free.
- We should leave.

436
00:41:03,076 --> 00:41:04,427
Okey, we go.

437
00:41:05,331 --> 00:41:10,138
<i > Official 10178,
report you to the center.</i>

438
00:41:10,173 --> 00:41:11,254
We will cover.

439
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:13,723
What do you make?, no.

440
00:41:14,223 --> 00:41:15,249
Not I can run.

441
00:41:15,284 --> 00:41:17,328
I will be about affecting them
the system.

442
00:41:17,363 --> 00:41:18,624
Well, make it.

443
00:41:42,338 --> 00:41:43,697
He/she runs.

00:42:44,734 --> 00:42:46,523
<i > Stays still.</i>

451
00:42:46,558 --> 00:42:48,278
- Dowell.
- What?

452
00:42:48,313 --> 00:42:49,706
We are losing
time.

453
00:42:51,738 --> 00:42:54,494
Well, well.

454
00:42:54,529 --> 00:42:58,748

<i > TO the right for
the control.</i>

456
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:08,713
To attack, it lacks to attack 9.

457
00:43:09,551 --> 00:43:10,512
What does it happen?

458
00:43:11,346 --> 00:43:12,717
Clever to move.

459
00:43:16,225 --> 00:43:20,113
To attack, it lacks to attack
3,2,1.

460
00:43:20,148 --> 00:43:21,377
Now.

461
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,829
Let us leave, we go.

462
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:36,177
OH not, how will we leave?

463
00:43:36,212 --> 00:43:39,057
- Is it only an illusion?
- What?

464
00:43:39,092 --> 00:43:43,378
Be it is their last warning.

465
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:47,377
Be it is its... 

466
00:44:03,116 --> 00:44:05,212
After everything,
you are astute.

467
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:15,696
<i > The identification chip is
amusing and it is law.</i>

468
00:44:15,731 --> 00:44:19,913
<i > he/she Makes the best work
I rake possible.</i>

469
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:22,800
<i > you will Be in problems
before getting the solution.</i>

470
00:44:22,835 --> 00:44:25,217
<i > The identification chip
he/she makes all possible one.</i>

471
00:44:25,577 --> 00:44:28,865
The man that come has
state 10 years here.

472
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,509
He/she Is Alex MacDowell.

473
00:44:30,544 --> 00:44:33,399
He/she is the leader of the rebels.

474
00:44:33,434 --> 00:44:38,441
Last night it was about destroying
the program of illusion.

475
00:44:38,476 --> 00:44:41,680
Not it is the only crime
that they will see here.

476
00:44:42,196 --> 00:44:47,678
But the end of the era,
the end of the ability... 

477
00:44:47,713 --> 00:44:50,065
 ... of the chip to maintain
the peace and the order.

478
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,822
Of which I am to position.

479
00:44:51,857 --> 00:44:53,860
<i > he/she Offers some solution
Sr Valentine?</i>

480
00:44:53,895 --> 00:44:56,102
Of that I speak.

481
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:00,870
Per years we have worked
for the correct behavior... 

482
00:45:00,905 --> 00:45:03,010
 ... in the individual's bases.

483
00:45:03,045 --> 00:45:08,451
Not we can give him/her what there are
learned the whole population.

484
00:45:14,315 --> 00:45:16,038
This is Srta. Noel.

485
00:45:16,073 --> 00:45:20,154
A reasonable victim of
a violator of this city.

486
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:22,743
Look.

487
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:30,928
Srta. Noel, thank you
to come.

488
00:45:30,963 --> 00:45:34,422
We have some details
with respect to your case.

489
00:45:34,457 --> 00:45:35,753
Here, please.

490
00:45:39,296 --> 00:45:40,841
I am already with you.

491
00:45:54,931 --> 00:45:59,393
Hello, excuse.

492
00:46:06,256 --> 00:46:08,544
Allow me to leave of here.

493
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:10,193
Allow me to leave.

494
00:46:19,853 --> 00:46:25,079
The chip tells us how chemical
he/she makes it behave this way.

495
00:46:25,114 --> 00:46:28,245
When manipulating those chemists.

496
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,161
Through the chip.

497
00:46:31,638 --> 00:46:34,522
We will begin all the one
emotional control.

498
00:46:34,557 --> 00:46:36,067
Of the individual.

499
00:48:00,007 --> 00:48:03,618
Good, I don't need to say more.

500
00:48:03,653 --> 00:48:06,059
<i > you Speak of modifying the one
behavior of... </i>

501
00:48:06,094 --> 00:48:07,800
<i >... the whole population.</i>

502
00:48:07,835 --> 00:48:09,665
<i > That sounds something end.</i>

503
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,901
Perhaps, but the program
of illusion they want to eliminate it.

504
00:48:12,936 --> 00:48:16,811
And that is the disintegration,
it will provoke confusion.

505
00:48:16,846 --> 00:48:18,525
Arrests of civil.

506
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:23,003
Even crimes and the
people will accuse them.

507
00:48:23,427 --> 00:48:24,858
Ladies and gentlemen.

508
00:48:24,893 --> 00:48:27,680
We should control them
now and if.

509
00:48:27,715 --> 00:48:29,494
To make the corrections
of the characters.

510
00:48:29,529 --> 00:48:31,558
It is to maintain
the lie.

511
00:48:31,593 --> 00:48:33,676
And that You. continue there
and have a good time.

512
00:48:33,711 --> 00:48:37,201
<i > Thank you, Sr. Valentine,
the Council will vote.</i>

513
00:48:37,236 --> 00:48:38,708
Apologize.

514
00:48:58,324 --> 00:49:01,974
<i > Like he/she knows, the vote has
unanimous.</i>

515
00:49:02,009 --> 00:49:04,460
<i > The solution of the correction
of the behavior... </i>

516
00:49:04,495 --> 00:49:06,043
<i >... it has been denied this time.</i>

517
00:49:06,078 --> 00:49:07,736
Do excuse?

518
00:49:07,771 --> 00:49:11,920
<i > Our recommendation is
that it captures the woman and man.</i>

519
00:49:13,589 --> 00:49:15,369
Why has it been denied?

520
00:49:15,915 --> 00:49:19,978
<i > you Speak of removing to those
people the ability to judge.</i>

521
00:49:20,013 --> 00:49:21,266
<i > Of reacting.</i>

522
00:49:21,301 --> 00:49:22,465
<i > Of evolving.</i>

523
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,629
They will pay it.

524
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:29,099
<i > Their solution violates each
I begin of a society.</i>

525
00:49:29,134 --> 00:49:31,830
<i > Gentleman, the solution
it has been denied.</i>

526
00:49:31,865 --> 00:49:34,527
<i > we will Prove again
in three months.</i>

527
00:49:34,562 --> 00:49:35,884
<i > Thank you.</i>

528
00:49:35,919 --> 00:49:38,205
Thank You, Advice.

529
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,996
Today I spoke.

530
00:49:42,805 --> 00:49:44,720
<i > Valentine is impatient.</i>

531
00:49:44,755 --> 00:49:47,266
<i > it is I recommend one
it carries to an extreme surveillance.</i>

532
00:49:48,358 --> 00:49:49,703
Thank You, Kirkland.

533
00:51:23,915 --> 00:51:25,877
Sequential numbers.

534
00:51:25,912 --> 00:51:27,840
Not it is anything of these.

535
00:51:28,226 --> 00:51:29,258
Something more?

536
00:51:29,293 --> 00:51:30,536
I find this Greek.

537
00:51:31,645 --> 00:51:32,988
Not I agree.

538
00:51:35,355 --> 00:51:36,499
Do you know Greek?

539
00:51:36,681 --> 00:51:38,450
My language is better.

540
00:51:39,492 --> 00:51:40,744
How more?

541
00:51:40,779 --> 00:51:41,961
French.

542
00:51:41,996 --> 00:51:43,294
I Am from Germany.

543
00:51:43,941 --> 00:51:45,684
And you work as
police.

544
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:47,428
Do you have problem with that?

545
00:51:48,029 --> 00:51:51,542
No, I am a little
impressed.

546
00:51:51,837 --> 00:51:53,334
Impressed?

547
00:51:57,363 --> 00:51:59,181
You have something more
that he/she helps us?

548
00:51:59,674 --> 00:52:01,588
I play the piano.

549
00:52:03,604 --> 00:52:04,563
It is there.

550
00:52:04,974 --> 00:52:06,202
That is.

551
00:52:06,237 --> 00:52:07,431
It is music.

552
00:52:10,413 --> 00:52:12,444
The letters represent
the music's sound.

553
00:52:13,167 --> 00:52:15,514
Do, re, my, fa, so, the,
if, do

554
00:52:16,111 --> 00:52:17,646
Then what we have?

555
00:52:17,681 --> 00:52:19,182
Good, we have, my double.

556
00:52:19,217 --> 00:52:20,608
My, my, fa, so.

557
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:23,280
It is a road.

558
00:52:23,315 --> 00:52:24,842
One of the most famous
well-known.

559
00:52:24,877 --> 00:52:26,652
He/she will help us,
unite.

560
00:52:26,687 --> 00:52:27,920
Make it again.

561
00:52:31,087 --> 00:52:32,746
OH for heaven's sake.

562
00:52:33,965 --> 00:52:35,830
You that you/they put it there.

563
00:52:37,164 --> 00:52:39,969
The signs of the computer
he/she says that it is the mail.

564
00:52:40,004 --> 00:52:41,284
The mail?

565
00:52:41,801 --> 00:52:43,563
The concerned Council is
for the mail?

566
00:52:43,598 --> 00:52:45,876
No, it cannot be certain.

567
00:52:45,911 --> 00:52:48,120
Also, that is confidential.

568
00:52:48,155 --> 00:52:51,161
I secrete for the civilians,
but it is made for protection.

569
00:52:51,987 --> 00:52:53,759
The mail is of the Council.

570
00:52:53,794 --> 00:52:55,074
Can you find it?

571
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:57,738
That is classified, only
the adults know it.

572
00:52:58,216 --> 00:53:00,411
But you where to find
to one of them.

573
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:04,814
This is what you will receive
in your mind.

574
00:53:07,063 --> 00:53:08,371
Do you feel better?

575
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,096
That waits.

576
00:53:11,131 --> 00:53:13,392
I need answers to
some questions.

577
00:53:14,363 --> 00:53:16,550
You that your silence
it is like a rock.

578
00:53:16,585 --> 00:53:19,982
They die in the hands of their
torturing without saying a word.

579
00:53:20,017 --> 00:53:22,400
During 17 centuries.

580
00:53:24,897 --> 00:53:27,997
It is really very elegant.

581
00:53:28,032 --> 00:53:30,103
It is the most powerful thing for
to make questions these days.

582
00:53:30,138 --> 00:53:32,006
It is useful.

583
00:53:41,306 --> 00:53:43,305
I need to know your plan.

584
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:46,973
I see that they have a great one
interest in my tower.

585
00:53:47,008 --> 00:53:48,362
What they made there.

586
00:53:56,004 --> 00:53:57,415
<i > Monitor.</i>

587
00:54:00,532 --> 00:54:02,808
<i > Beginning discharge.</i>

588
00:54:04,898 --> 00:54:06,542
<i > Of the virus.</i>

589
00:54:08,989 --> 00:54:11,285
They discharged it.

590
00:54:11,986 --> 00:54:13,786
Intelligent.

591
00:54:13,821 --> 00:54:16,466
Chequeamos,
we don't find anything.

592
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:20,043
How you know that the one
Does he like Council classic music?

593
00:54:20,078 --> 00:54:25,014
It is my matter, when I was
there, I saw it in their identification.

594
00:54:25,339 --> 00:54:28,680
Everything that makes from
15 years ago.

595
00:54:28,715 --> 00:54:30,224
He is behind.

596
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:33,586
It is one of the aspects
that they were.

597
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:43,205
Which the nature is
of this group?

598
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:48,979
<i > Friends, listen.</i>

599
00:54:49,014 --> 00:54:51,234
<i > The government will be
against us.</i>

600
00:54:51,269 --> 00:54:52,802
<i > they Know what I say.</i>

601
00:54:52,837 --> 00:54:54,524
<i > I Say that we enter
inside them.</i>

602
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:56,212
<i > AND I say that we give him/her
twice as much.</i>

603
00:54:56,247 --> 00:54:58,365
If.

604
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,571
<i > we will Begin with the tower
of communication.</i>

605
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:01,636
<i > you. they know my virus
it is in my chip.</i>

606
00:55:03,279 --> 00:55:04,741
That works.

607
00:55:04,776 --> 00:55:06,532
<i > The tower of the center
of the net where they work.</i>

608
00:55:06,567 --> 00:55:10,930
<i > If we put the virus there,
we will have 20% of the city.</i>

609
00:55:10,965 --> 00:55:12,491
Who is that woman?

610
00:55:12,526 --> 00:55:13,982
<i > we will continue.</i>

611
00:55:14,017 --> 00:55:16,175
<i > Changing all those chip.</i>

612
00:55:16,949 --> 00:55:18,488
It is already clever.

613
00:55:25,606 --> 00:55:27,459
Which is their name?

614
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,711
Small Kyla.

615
00:55:46,317 --> 00:55:49,454
Made of an experiment
crazy.

616
00:55:50,843 --> 00:55:56,125
I always said that
it should be eliminated.

617
00:55:59,428 --> 00:56:01,221
Languages of that type like
if you knew it.

618
00:56:02,219 --> 00:56:04,436
When he/she had nine, I was
in a car accident.

619
00:56:04,471 --> 00:56:06,261
My parents died.

620
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:08,017
My pains came.

621
00:56:08,052 --> 00:56:10,487
The main one implanted me a chip.

622
00:56:10,522 --> 00:56:12,481
It fixed my problem.

623
00:56:13,702 --> 00:56:15,685
It put me in observation.

624
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,498
And it adopted me.

625
00:56:18,446 --> 00:56:20,269
So you know enough.

626
00:56:20,304 --> 00:56:21,946
If.

627
00:56:21,981 --> 00:56:24,337
I left the Institute when
he/she had 15.

628
00:56:24,372 --> 00:56:25,542
15.

629
00:56:25,577 --> 00:56:26,667
Then what step?

630
00:56:27,672 --> 00:56:29,346
He/she sent me so that it will change.

631
00:56:29,381 --> 00:56:31,976
He/she needed to know if
it was safe there.

632
00:56:32,356 --> 00:56:34,586
Some months later
there was an accident.

633
00:56:35,162 --> 00:56:37,277
All those of the chip died.

634
00:56:37,312 --> 00:56:39,193
- Then your chip... 
- Correct.

635
00:56:40,042 --> 00:56:42,252
My chip brought all this.

636
00:56:45,929 --> 00:56:48,126
Well, you have been useful.

637
00:56:49,428 --> 00:56:53,414
They say that when you die,
your life passes in front of you.

638
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,011
Let us discover it.

639
00:57:08,188 --> 00:57:09,748
I believe that not.

640
00:57:57,132 --> 00:57:59,788
Massages.

641
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:08,144
To who do you look for?

642
00:58:10,298 --> 00:58:13,478
I should imagine it, you used to have
a police good instinct.

643
00:58:13,513 --> 00:58:14,909
Not it is late that change
of seeming.

644
00:58:15,186 --> 00:58:16,767
You will drive.

645
00:58:17,836 --> 00:58:19,999
This is bigger than you,
you cannot stop it.

646
00:58:20,034 --> 00:58:21,315
Nobody.

647
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:23,319
Anything, they will have the
that they want.

648
00:58:23,354 --> 00:58:24,236
If.

649
00:58:24,271 --> 00:58:26,087
They are more intelligent
that you.

650
00:58:26,122 --> 00:58:27,903
You intelligent,
it drives.

651
00:58:42,841 --> 00:58:44,258
Not it is an illusion.

652
00:58:45,266 --> 00:58:47,615
Everything is real.

653
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:49,056
You have to see my house.

654
00:58:49,091 --> 00:58:50,572
OH Jesse.

655
00:59:04,345 --> 00:59:08,049
Jesse is a good type.

656
00:59:08,084 --> 00:59:11,753
Him you, I saw it in their eyes.

657
00:59:13,042 --> 00:59:14,760
We will see it, okey.

658
00:59:15,672 --> 00:59:18,737
We will see if your style
it serves as something.

659
00:59:31,761 --> 00:59:34,094
My style bothers you.

660
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:45,093
Not shoot.

661
00:59:45,128 --> 00:59:46,863
A step more and I kill him.

662
00:59:46,898 --> 00:59:48,541
Dr. Demeo.

663
00:59:48,576 --> 00:59:49,976
Don't tell me anything.

664
00:59:50,011 --> 00:59:52,217
Not they will eliminate their
problems.

665
00:59:52,252 --> 00:59:53,542
Eliminating me to my.

666
00:59:53,577 --> 00:59:54,882
Donalson.

667
01:00:02,536 --> 01:00:05,089
I am me, Kyla.

668
01:00:08,568 --> 01:00:09,896
You are really you.

669
01:00:12,295 --> 01:00:14,287
Who does come with you?

670
01:00:14,322 --> 01:00:15,334
Alex MacDowell.

671
01:00:15,369 --> 01:00:17,801
Official of the Security.

672
01:00:17,836 --> 01:00:19,581
Now they look for me.

673
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,327
Lower the weapon.

674
01:00:23,771 --> 01:00:25,976
We broke the security of
the host computer.

675
01:00:26,011 --> 01:00:29,961
And we find one
inscription.

676
01:00:31,276 --> 01:00:32,726
Alex.

677
01:00:48,253 --> 01:00:54,245
How ago your favorite music
in your program of illusion?

678
01:00:56,651 --> 01:00:58,849
Always looking for something.

679
01:00:58,884 --> 01:01:01,015
Pressing for one
correct answer.

680
01:01:01,531 --> 01:01:02,644
Leave you.

681
01:01:12,198 --> 01:01:14,189
How exactly you do want to know?

682
01:01:14,224 --> 01:01:16,375
I need to know the code.

683
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:20,539
I want to know because the one
Dr. John is the Main of the Council.

684
01:01:20,574 --> 01:01:24,669
And the main thing, what you have
that to do with the program of illusion?

685
01:01:28,067 --> 01:01:32,298
Mr., he/she allows to wonder him/her
why Valentine is in his position.

686
01:01:32,333 --> 01:01:36,529
Because he/she leaves it so that it completed
the purpose for the following step.

687
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:37,530
And Valentine doesn't tolerate that
the center is involved.

688
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:41,682
Following step?

689
01:01:43,538 --> 01:01:46,736
If, the total control
of the universe.

690
01:01:46,771 --> 01:01:50,748
Controlling people for
the chemistry of the brain.

691
01:01:52,878 --> 01:01:54,462
And the program of illusion?

692
01:01:54,497 --> 01:01:56,320
No, that is passed.

693
01:01:56,355 --> 01:01:58,624
So you already knew it.

694
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,641
You were the engineers' part.

695
01:02:06,478 --> 01:02:10,674
Very well, he/she believes the program
of illusion.

696
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:13,874
That was unavoidable.

697
01:02:15,001 --> 01:02:17,056
After I put you
the chip.

698
01:02:17,091 --> 01:02:21,393
The idea grew, the
it influences through the chip.

699
01:02:21,428 --> 01:02:22,965
Although we had it.

700
01:02:24,716 --> 01:02:26,371
nobody could cross it.

701
01:02:26,406 --> 01:02:28,798
For that reason you change the
countersign, certain?

702
01:02:30,069 --> 01:02:33,559
Kyla, alone I want to improve
the life.

703
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,815
Not I have alternative.

704
01:02:39,447 --> 01:02:42,824
Valentine is behind
the forces of the institute.

705
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:46,163
He/she has you order of having
the chips with him.

706
01:02:46,198 --> 01:02:48,335
He/she is the only man that can
to guarantee the security.

707
01:02:50,401 --> 01:02:53,472
He/she will take them to all,
participate or not.

708
01:02:55,088 --> 01:02:56,866
And I need it a lot.

709
01:02:56,901 --> 01:02:59,114
You will make rather
of what you/they believe.

710
01:02:59,149 --> 01:03:00,780
Okey.

711
01:03:01,372 --> 01:03:02,515
A lance.

712
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:03,995
That is pure garbage.

713
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:09,657
It has not killed you because you
it manages.

714
01:03:09,692 --> 01:03:10,741
No.

715
01:03:10,776 --> 01:03:14,021
But I have allowed it to kill
because that is what works.

716
01:03:23,825 --> 01:03:27,023
Base, The captain Meyer here.

717
01:03:27,058 --> 01:03:28,402
What?

718
01:03:31,309 --> 01:03:34,540
Azolar, the fear.

719
01:03:34,575 --> 01:03:36,106
To kill.

720
01:03:37,687 --> 01:03:40,124
You mean that everything
that was intentional.

721
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:43,413
That is difficult to believe.

722
01:03:43,448 --> 01:03:45,801
That is what is made
internationally.

723
01:03:45,836 --> 01:03:48,488
Something that brings the economy.

724
01:03:48,849 --> 01:03:53,772
Something that destroys to
people that don't accept... 

725
01:03:53,807 --> 01:03:55,930
 ... the strongest and magic thing.

726
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:59,693
He/she wants that people
alive with fear.

727
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:03,451
When you are afraid,
you don't think.

728
01:04:03,486 --> 01:04:06,117
You alone you continue.

729
01:04:08,467 --> 01:04:10,053
Neither I am afraid.

730
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:13,956
I have the dream of
the perfect society.

731
01:04:14,823 --> 01:04:18,677
Although it is not real, him
I live in my illusion.

732
01:04:20,888 --> 01:04:22,707
I will show him/her the truth
to people.

733
01:04:22,742 --> 01:04:24,527
Before it is
too much afternoon.

734
01:04:26,401 --> 01:04:27,633
Here.

735
01:04:31,561 --> 01:04:32,985
Give me your weapon.

736
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:39,713
This is what is
of the code.

737
01:04:40,479 --> 01:04:44,284
This part corresponds to
the devices.

738
01:04:45,747 --> 01:04:50,847
So the first are
the significant one.

739
01:04:56,321 --> 01:04:57,784
Good night.

740
01:04:59,117 --> 01:05:01,109
What devils do you make here?

741
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,200
Do you know who am?

742
01:05:03,235 --> 01:05:04,465
It should be the Main one.

743
01:05:06,132 --> 01:05:07,770
Neither they think it.

744
01:06:00,281 --> 01:06:01,915
Very bad MacDowell.

745
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:04,726
It had been easy
in the street.

746
01:06:04,761 --> 01:06:08,913
If you will remember who is the one
superior in this society.

747
01:06:08,948 --> 01:06:13,065
You will take me a little
with difficult people as you.

748
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:14,536
But the program.

749
01:06:14,571 --> 01:06:19,576
It will be used with you for
to replace the new citizen.

750
01:06:20,362 --> 01:06:21,786
The show begins.

751
01:07:07,507 --> 01:07:08,810
OH God.

752
01:07:24,013 --> 01:07:26,298

Leave it.

What do you make him/her?

756
01:07:48,923 --> 01:07:51,041
<i > please.</i>

757
01:07:53,356 --> 01:07:57,481
MacDowell, closes the eyes
to the problems.

758
01:07:57,516 --> 01:08:00,762
In time, I will send it to you
to your Chip.

759
01:08:00,797 --> 01:08:04,262

Granted access.

765
01:09:10,566 --> 01:09:12,317
Beginning of the connection.

766
01:09:18,472 --> 01:09:20,235
It discharges the virus.

767
01:09:52,734 --> 01:09:54,166
<i > The knowledge is
limited.</i>

768
01:09:55,138 --> 01:09:58,096
<i > But you always can
to use it.</i>

769
01:10:03,402 --> 01:10:07,822
Good, we finally know each other.

770
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:14,796
That is what you have in mind.

771
01:10:16,602 --> 01:10:18,732
I am not you afraid.

772
01:10:18,767 --> 01:10:19,961
Exactly.

773
01:10:22,139 --> 01:10:23,588
Not you can stop it.

774
01:10:24,112 --> 01:10:26,490
People already know it.

775
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:30,105
What he/she makes you think that
do I want to stop it?

776
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:34,233
For some reason,
they didn't give it to me.

777
01:10:34,268 --> 01:10:36,965
Something of maintaining the balance.

778
01:10:37,453 --> 01:10:39,012
But now thanks to you.

779
01:10:39,047 --> 01:10:41,426

He/she is taking a lot.

781

Calm down, my friend.

the eyes from all over the world.

785
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:08,464

The right to be free.

793
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:41,699
Freedom?

794
01:11:41,734 --> 01:11:44,292
It liberates it it is of
an agreement.

795

Among the world, people
he/she lives with fear.

796
01:11:47,925 --> 01:11:49,777
You can change it.

797

If they are organized.

798

experiment.

We have a problem
of reception.

806
01:13:08,042 --> 01:13:10,925
Where is my city?

807
01:13:14,343 --> 01:13:18,462
Sr. Valentine, if there is a
problem, why it doesn't solve it.

808
01:13:18,497 --> 01:13:20,932

The truth is that you are quiet.
