00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:30,033
This is Eddie Brown. I told him all about you and your family.

357
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,366
- Oh, terrific. Hi, Eddie. Nice to meet you.

358
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:35,266
- A pleasure to meet you too, Mrs. Griffin.

359
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,400
- Well, a very well-mannered young man.

360
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:38,633
- Mm-hmm.

361
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,933
- Josh, Karl. - What do you think, Eddie?

362
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,066
- It's a cool house. - Guys, this is Eddie Brown.

363
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:47,133
- Put her there, pal. I'm Karl Griffin.

364
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,333
- And this is our son, Josh. - Hey, dude.

365
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,566
- Hey.

366
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:52,366
- Well, it looks like it's time for me

367
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:55,233
to let you all get acquainted. You okay with everything?

368
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,433
- Yeah, I'm fine.

369
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,133
- I'll be checking in every now and again

370
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,100
to see how things are going. Take care.

371
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:06,933
- Thank you. - Thanks. I appreciate it.

372
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,600
- So, Eddie, you're going to be sharing a room with Josh.

373
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:12,200
You want to show it to him? - Yeah, sure. Come on.

374
00:22:12,266 --> 00:22:13,733
Hey, you like "Death Race" comics?

375
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,133
- Yeah, cool.

376
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,566
- Cool. I've got every issue. You want to see them?

377
00:22:16,633 --> 00:22:18,566
- Sure.

378
00:22:18,633 --> 00:22:20,566
- Oh, I think this is going to work out just fine.

379
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:24,433
- [chuckles]

380
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,300
- All right. Now, this up here is my room.

381
00:22:28,366 --> 00:22:30,166
- It's on the second floor? That's awesome.

382
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:33,133
- Yeah, man. It is the second floor.

383
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,266
So you like horror movies? - Heck yeah.

384
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,366
Have you ever seen, "Lizard Brides From Saturn"?

385
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:38,766
- Never heard of it.

386
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,633
- It's, like, the coolest of the all-time horror flicks.

387
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,166
They show it sometimes on the weekends.

388
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:43,600
- Well, maybe I can get my mom to take us

389
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:46,033
to the Olen Ray Theater this weekend.

390
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,333
- Hey, check this out. - Play Slime.

391
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,866
My mom told me that if she ever caught me

392
00:22:50,933 --> 00:22:53,366
with this stuff again, she'd ground me for a week.

393
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:54,766
- Well, if parents hate it,

394
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,366
we got to love it. - Yeah.

395
00:22:56,433 --> 00:22:59,400
I can tell you and I are going to get along just fine.

396
00:22:59,466 --> 00:23:01,933
But there is something I ought to tell you.

397
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,300
Weird things happen here sometimes.

398
00:23:04,366 --> 00:23:06,533
- Weird things? Like what?

399
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,200
- Well, like, sometimes when my mom gets a little stressed,

400
00:23:09,266 --> 00:23:11,933
and her blood pressure goes up, she turns invisible.

401
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,433
- Invisible? No way. - Big way.

402
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,300
You see, my dad is a scientist, and it all started

403
00:23:16,366 --> 00:23:18,700
when he invented this invisibility formula.

404
00:23:18,766 --> 00:23:22,066
- Yes.

405
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:23,500
It looks good. Huh, Cosmo?

406
00:23:23,566 --> 00:23:26,533
[dog whining]

407
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,933
You want to help Daddy with an invention?

408
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,366
- First he tested it on the dog.

409
00:23:30,433 --> 00:23:32,400
- That's right, Cosmo.

410
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,600
[dog barks]

411
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:48,466
Oh, wow.

412
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:50,000
Oh, wow. Wow.

413
00:23:50,066 --> 00:23:51,366
- Then I tested it on my friend's iguana,

414
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:53,166
because I wanted to use the formula

415
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:55,066
to sneak out of the house when I was grounded.

416
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:00,166
And then I wanted to use the formula later,

417
00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:02,400
so I hid it in a soda bottle.

418
00:24:02,466 --> 00:24:04,100
Then my mom found the soda bottle,

419
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:06,833
Well, you can guess what happened next.

420
00:24:14,466 --> 00:24:16,000
- [gasps]

421
00:24:21,633 --> 00:24:26,666
What?

422
00:24:26,733 --> 00:24:28,233
Oh, my gosh.

423
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,666
- But she seems okay now.

424
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:31,333
- Well, that's because my dad invented an antidote,

425
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,700
and she returned to normal-- well, pretty normal anyway.

426
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:52,066
- Gross.

427
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:55,100
- Look at that. Amazing.

428
00:25:06,966 --> 00:25:09,000
- But it doesn't happen as often as it used to.

429
00:25:09,066 --> 00:25:12,033
She just fades in and out every now and then.

430
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,100
- Hey, is there any more of that stuff hanging around?

431
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:16,366
- Nope. Government came and took it, and that was that.

432
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:19,633
- We could have had some major fun with that stuff.

433
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,766
- Yeah, right.

434
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:23,866
[crickets chirping]

435
00:25:30,733 --> 00:25:32,533
- He seems like a nice kid.

436
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,166
- Yeah, he and Josh have sure hit it off.

437
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:38,333
I think he's going to be a good friend for him.

438
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,900
All those years in the orphanage

439
00:25:40,966 --> 00:25:43,766
must have been so hard on him.

440
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:47,400
I just--I want to make it up to him, you know?

441
00:25:54,566 --> 00:25:57,100
- Have I told you lately how much I love you?

442
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:59,833
- Better be careful talking up a woman like that.

443
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,766
It could get you into more trouble than you bargained for.

444
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:07,233
- Oh, Mrs. Griffin, I thrive on trouble.

445
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,000
- [laughs]

446
00:26:09,066 --> 00:26:13,233
You just remember that until I get back.

447
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,866
I'm going to say good night to the boys.

448
00:26:14,933 --> 00:26:20,533
- Hurry.

449
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,200
- Whew.

450
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:28,266
- Okay, guys, bedtime.

451
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:30,900
Cute.

452
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:33,600
So, Eddie,

453
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:35,933
I'm never going to take the place of your real mom.

454
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,933
I'm not even going to try. I just want you to know

455
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,066
you have a home here for as long as you want it.

456
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:44,800
- I like it here, Mrs. Griffin. You guys are so cool.

457
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:48,333
- Yeah. Well, you're pretty cool yourself, kiddo.

458
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,333
I think we better take this off to go to sleep.

459
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,666
What do you say? Okay, bedtime, both of you.

460
00:26:53,733 --> 00:26:55,033
Just because it's summer vacation,

461
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,833
there's still plenty to do around here. Good night.

462
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,400
- Good night, Mom. - Good night.

463
00:27:07,366 --> 00:27:10,000
[thunder booming]

464
00:27:12,566 --> 00:27:16,533
- Bernard. Bernard.

465
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,500
Oh, there you are. I need you to show me

466
00:27:18,566 --> 00:27:20,666
how to work the sound effects system.

467
00:27:20,733 --> 00:27:23,166
- I can't go through with it, Olivia.

468
00:27:23,233 --> 00:27:28,066
I can't send this poor child to a cold, early grave.

469
00:27:28,133 --> 00:27:32,500
Goodbye, dear sister. Goodbye.

470
00:27:32,566 --> 00:27:35,233
- [gasps]

471
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,366
[shrieks]

472
00:27:39,433 --> 00:27:41,500
- Mu-ha-ha-ha-ha. Boog-a, boog-a, boog-a.

473
00:27:41,566 --> 00:27:47,833
- Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

474
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,700
- Boo.

475
00:27:49,766 --> 00:27:51,133
- Uhh...

476
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,100
- [laughs]

477
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:56,433
- You nearly scared me half to death.

478
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,300
- Well, then I only did half a job. Didn't I?

479
00:28:00,366 --> 00:28:03,466
- Save the comedy for later.

480
00:28:03,533 --> 00:28:05,166
[wind whistling]

481
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:08,400
[thunder booming]

482
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,900
I want you to tell me how to operate this wretched machine.

483
00:28:18,966 --> 00:28:20,133
- Ohh.

484
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,233
[knock at door]

485
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,900
Are we expecting anyone?

486
00:28:25,966 --> 00:28:28,500
- Shut up and answer the door.

487
00:28:28,566 --> 00:28:32,333
- Yah vol, da commandant.

488
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,066
- Oh. I was walking my dog,

489
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:49,266
Lester, and we heard screams.

490
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:51,333
Is everything all right?

491
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,800
- Oh, that? We were rehearsing. - Oh, really?

492
00:28:55,866 --> 00:29:00,633
Rehearsing for what?

493
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,066
- A scene...

494
00:29:02,133 --> 00:29:05,033
a scene we're doing for Uncle's funeral tomorrow.

495
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,566
- Yes, he was such a fan of the theater that we thought

496
00:29:08,633 --> 00:29:09,966
we would share a scene

497
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:14,266
from his favorite play with the attendees.

498
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:17,500
- And what play would that be?

499
00:29:17,566 --> 00:29:19,933
- What play? Yes, of course.

500
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,466
- George Bernard Shaw's... - Bernard.

501
00:29:23,533 --> 00:29:27,533
- George Bernard Shaw's "Man and Superman."

502
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,700
- I don't remember that play having any screaming in it.

503
00:29:32,766 --> 00:29:34,633
- Well, this is the modern version.

504
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,766
Now, if you will excuse us... - Well...

505
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:39,633
- We have a lot of work to do. - Oh, I dare say.

506
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,866
Oh, this dog. Take your dog with you, huh?

507
00:29:42,933 --> 00:29:46,233
Good night now.

508
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,733
- Ooh. Well, I don't know about you, Lester,

509
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,900
but I think those people are downright weird.

510
00:29:51,966 --> 00:29:53,966
- "Man and Superman"? Why didn't you say, "Macbeth"?

511
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:55,966
At least they scream in "Macbeth."

512
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:57,966
- How would you know? You're illiterate.

513
00:29:58,033 --> 00:30:01,333
- I am not. Mommy and Daddy were married.

514
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,033
- I think they're up to something.

515
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,900
We'd better keep a close eye on them.

516
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:13,000
- Okay. If you put the soap on now

517
00:30:13,066 --> 00:30:14,300
and let them dry,

518
00:30:14,366 --> 00:30:16,133
they'll wash themselves right after the meal.

519
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,066
- I'm not too sure about this. - Oh, trust me.

520
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:22,600
All my inventions work. Okay? Now, let's put them back.

521
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:23,733
- All right.

522
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:39,000
- [grunting]

523
00:30:42,866 --> 00:30:44,400
[grunts]

524
00:30:44,466 --> 00:30:48,133
Ehh! Ahh!

525
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,433
Ugh!

526
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,900
[grunting]

527
00:30:54,966 --> 00:30:57,900
Ugh! Ahh!

528
00:30:57,966 --> 00:31:00,300
[both grunting]

529
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,200
- You've been out in lab all morning.

530
00:31:04,266 --> 00:31:05,400
Anything come of it?

531
00:31:05,466 --> 00:31:07,200

01:22:10,466 --> 01:22:12,633
keep going on about how the ghosts are haunting them.

1407
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:14,400
I think they're candidates for the bughouse.

1408
01:22:14,466 --> 01:22:15,700
- Yeah, I think we're done.

1409
01:22:15,766 --> 01:22:17,600
You said you're the family lawyer.

1410
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:19,566
You probably want to come down to the station.

1411
01:22:19,633 --> 01:22:21,066
- Oh, not necessarily.

1412
01:22:21,133 --> 01:22:24,300
It couldn't happen to a more deserving pair, if you ask me.

1413
01:22:24,366 --> 01:22:25,533
Good night, officers.

1414
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:28,233
- Good night.

1415
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:31,833
- I handled all of your late grandfather's business affairs.

1416
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:33,800
You're quite a rich young man.

1417
01:22:33,866 --> 01:22:35,400
You'll need some financial guidance,

1418
01:22:35,466 --> 01:22:38,666
and I'd be more than happy to continue on in your employ.

1419
01:22:38,733 --> 01:22:43,033
- Yeah, sure, whatever. - What's the matter, Eddie?

1420
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:44,633
This is a great opportunity.

1421
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:46,000
- I guess.

1422
01:22:46,066 --> 01:22:49,766
I mean, I have to live in this big house all by myself.

1423
01:22:49,833 --> 01:22:51,266
Josh can't live here,

1424
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:54,833
because he's got his own family,

1425
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:58,300
his own home, and his own mom.

1426
01:23:00,566 --> 01:23:04,066
- Oh, Eddie.

1427
01:23:04,133 --> 01:23:06,900
I will always be here for you.

1428
01:23:06,966 --> 01:23:09,433
You guys can get together whenever you want.

1429

- Really? You mean it? Cool. - Hold on now.

1430
01:23:12,966 --> 01:23:15,866
Did I say you were going to be living here all by yourself?

1431
01:23:15,933 --> 01:23:17,566
Not on your life. You're going to have

1432
01:23:17,633 --> 01:23:21,000
an adult here with you night and day seven days a week.

1433
01:23:21,066 --> 01:23:23,166
- Oh, terrific.

1434
01:23:23,233 --> 01:23:25,066
- Let me introduce you to your new guardian.

1435
01:23:37,433 --> 01:23:42,166
- Mom? - Eddie.

1436
01:23:47,866 --> 01:23:52,566
You must be the Griffins. Mrs. Mason told me about you.

1437
01:23:52,633 --> 01:23:55,966
Thank you for taking such good care of my son.

1438
01:23:56,033 --> 01:23:57,833
- He's a good kid.

1439
01:23:57,900 --> 01:24:01,200
- You know, I'm a little confused.

1440
01:24:01,266 --> 01:24:03,833
It might not be any of my business,

1441
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:09,533
but where have you been all of these years?

1442
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:14,433
- In hiding. You see, after Eddie's father died,

1443
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:18,600
thanks to his cousins, well, I couldn't prove it.

1444
01:24:18,666 --> 01:24:21,300
I knew they'd come after us to finish the job

1445
01:24:21,366 --> 01:24:23,966
and wipe out any inheritors.

1446
01:24:24,033 --> 01:24:27,766
There I was alone and penniless.

1447
01:24:27,833 --> 01:24:29,633
I knew I couldn't keep Eddie safe

1448
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:32,133
unless I put him away in hiding.

1449
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:35,800
So I went to the orphanage, and I changed his last name.

1450
01:24:35,866 --> 01:24:39,766
And I prayed Bernard and Olivia would never find him.

1451
01:24:39,833 --> 01:24:42,100
- And when they made such a big deal out of adopting him

1452
01:24:42,166 --> 01:24:44,900
after Randolph St. John passed away,

1453
01:24:44,966 --> 01:24:46,733
I knew it was just a matter of time before Eddie

1454
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:50,333
met up with a quote, unquote unfortunate accident.

1455
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:54,000
- When I heard about Randolph passing away,

1456
01:24:54,066 --> 01:24:56,033
I knew it was time to surface.

1457
01:24:56,100 --> 01:25:01,100
I tracked down Mr. Preston, and here I am.

1458
01:25:01,166 --> 01:25:05,600
Eddie, I'm sorry it took so long.

1459
01:25:05,666 --> 01:25:08,700
Can you ever forgive me?

1460
01:25:08,766 --> 01:25:09,966
- You're my mom.

1461
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:18,800
- Well, I guess that settles it.

1462
01:25:18,866 --> 01:25:20,000
We have papers to sign,

1463
01:25:20,066 --> 01:25:22,466
but that can wait for a day or so.

01:25:22,533 --> 01:25:23,700

What about you, honey?

1469
01:25:36,166 --> 01:25:38,066
Are you okay? - Oh, I'm fine.

1470
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:41,133
I think the serum has finally worn off.

1471
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:47,166
- You know, I kind of like this wraparound look. Look at you.
